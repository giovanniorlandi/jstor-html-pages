About Hit\nCountry and Its History\nIS INDEMNITY TOO BIG?\nA comparison between what a victorious Germany exacted of\nFrance in 1X71 ami what the Allies\' arc now demanding of Germany\nin defeat is hoth pertinent and illuminating, in the opinion of Mine\nof our editorial observers. The indemnity paid ly France after\nthe Franco-Prussian wa; va 5.(XVKM) francs, or $1,KK).000,()OU\nand the Germans did not retire until it was paid in full. The pres\nent hill against Germany for 2Jr.f A0tJ0WX K,ld marks payable in\nforty-two years, experts estimate, is equivalent to a present cash\npayment of. $2I.(XX).UK.X)() which is less than the war debt of the\nUnited States alone savs the Xew York Tribune:\n"Mow does the bill\' of $1.(XXJ.(XX).(XX) which Germany presented\nto Trance compared with the tentative ?21MX).U(XI,IKX bill which\nthe Allies have submitted to Germany?\n"A preat change has occurred in the purchasing power of the\ngold mark in the fifty vears. Gold has depreciated more than\none-half. So on the basis of 1871 gold values; the bill is not more\nthan $10,(XX).XXJ,0m.\n"Secondly, the present population of Germany is about\ndouble that of France in 1K71. Measured per capita, then, what\nis now asked of Germany must be halved again to make a true\ncomparison. The reparations bill, when judged relatively, thus\nfails to $5,noo.om.(xj.\n"Thirdly, individual wealth per capita in Germany is some\nthing like lour times what it was in France in 1871. Allowing that\nhalf of this is due to gidd depreciation, the other half may be as\ncribed to a positive increase in wealth accumulation, and another\ncutting in two is needed to arrive at a true comparison. \'I his\nbrings the reparations total down to $2,5(X),LX)0,(XX).\n"Finally, the German bill in 1S71 was not to repair damage\n(Germany "was not invaded or a German brick disturbed), but\nsolely for war-expenditures. On the contrary, France is to get\nnothing for her war-expenditures only about one-half enough to\nrepair her ravaged territories. She is the poorer in actual property\nby many billions, tho Germany pay her bill in full, and longer than\nforty-two years her thrifty taxpayers will be burdened to meet the\ncvt f expelling the Germans.\n"It is high time to recognize exactly what the new; German\npropaganda implies.\' It meajis not only that Germany is to pay.\nrelatively little more than did France in 1871 ,hut that an intact\nGermany, having wantonly begun a war, is to emerge from the\nconflict in a condition to distance France in economic competi\ntion."\nIf fifty years ago Germany was justiled\n000,000,000 from France for a brief conflict\nwholly in French territory, remarks the Troy\nmauds as Germany is now required to meet\nthe word excessive." And the same paper goes on to say:\n"In the F\'ranco-Prussian War France had suffered to the ex\ntent of billions from an invasion by Germany and the prostration of\nits industries. Still an immense indemnity was asked, an\nindemnity which in modern figures would be at least twice as\ngreat. Its demand was enforced by the presence of German\ngarrisons.\n"Under the plan of the Allied Council Germany is not re\nquired, as France was in 171, to pay the entire costs of the war.\nGermany is only compelled to pay a small fraction of them. Dur\ning the struggle \'Germany kept its enemies out of its territory by,\ncrooked interpretations \' of treaties and by the scrapping of\nothers. It suffered not at all in comparison with its enemies.\nIt is whining now because its babies have not enough food; yet\nit retains 800,000 cows which it stole from Belgium and France,\nand which it promised to return. Its whole course has been\ncontemptible and savage from the beginning. The only way it\ncan understand its defeat is by making it pay for that defeat."\nAccording to Mr. Louis Klotz, French Minister of Finance,\nFrance\'s total share of the \' German indemnity represents only\nabout 50,000,000,000 francs gold if discounted, or what the 5,000,\n000,000 francs paid to Germany in 171 would now amount to at in\nterest. Speaking recently before the French Chamber, of Depu\nties, says a Paris dispatch to the New York Times, he argued that\n"owing to Belgium\'s priority claim France would get none of\nthe first year\'s payment by Germany, and that up to 1925 France\nwould receive only four or five billion marks gold." Moreover,\n"considering France\'s part would be only 50,000,000,000 francs and\nthat she owed 16,500,000,000 to America and 1000.000,000 to\nANNOUNCEMENTS\nron MAYOR\nO.

The Times reminds us that as\nlate as the middle of 1918 the Germans announced the intention of\nimposing the whole cost of the war, computed by themselves, on\nthe nations they were about, to conquer, and proclaimed that\n"we .will compel them to drag the chain for a hundred years".\nParis correspondents also remind us that the Germany that\nis now professing itself horrified at the size of the Allied bill\nconsidered itself able at the time of the peace negotiations to\npay an indemnity at the rate of 4.000,000,000 gold marks a year.\nThis offer was made by Count von BrockdorfT-Rantzau, German\nplenipotentiary at the Peace Conference. The total he suggested\nthat the Allies accept, however, was only 100.000,000,000 gold\nmarks. W hile the total now demanded by the Allies is more than\ntwice this amount, the present plan calls for payments of only two\nbillions the first two years, three the next three years, and then\nfour, five and six annually during the rest of the period.
