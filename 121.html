Gerard, ambassador to, Germany Ik-fore tlie beginning of the, war, jo. his articles in tlie 1\'hiladel, phia fublic l.eUger, tells of a con, versation with the kaiser lu which, the emoeror "showed great bitter, ness agaitiot the United States and, repeatedly said: \'America had bet, ter look out after the war" and \'1, shall stand uo uiore nonsense from, America after the war.\' ", That was nearly two years ago,, iu October 1^15, and every sensible, American knew what German senti, ment was. We did not need an au, thoritative revelation of it. A Ut, ile consideration of jvhat we were, doing was enough to indicate what, Germaay was thinking., There is 110 use in chasing af, ter the water that ha^ gone thru, the aiiU. but there is tragedy in the, reflection that the nation could, uot act upon facts which common, sense set before it. Two years ago, we knew that we were increasing, the stock of enmity which the Ger, man na\'ioa bor© toward the United, state\'s and we knew that Germany, \'would act under the impulse of, •his eumity., ice inertia wmca rumruKu, nation then and mail© it impossible, to obtain effec\'ive reform in our, national defense is inexplicable. Re, gret a useless utiles it indicates, that experience has taught us some, thing and that wo shall not be, found in such shape again by an, eueiuy we can plainly see., What the kaisar told Gerard in, this frank revelation of German, opinion is the complete justifica, tion for our being in the war. Our, dangers were apparent. The only, question was how y,Q should meet, then, whether we shuold wait for, them To come to us and do all the, damage possible or whether we, should step out to meet them and, make them as little injurious as, possible.—Chicago Tribune., SOMETHING FOR HIM TO READ, A great deal is being said about, seeing to it tha» our soldiers und, sailors get something to read., That "something" has been par, ticularized to a certain extent. At, any rate it has been suggested that, erganlzations be formed as clearing, houses through which stories and, magazine^ be sent to the men in, thtf tranches and on the 6hips., And the fact has been emphasiz, ed that our boys do not want mag, azines of the vintage 0/ 1900, but, real, live, up-to-datg reading mat, ter., It la obvious that the most ac, ceptablo "something to read" for, thea# men who are "doing their, bit" would be their favorite news, paper. 1 !

There, are important changes, and meth, ods of training and of fighting1 used, in previous >vars must, of course,, be modified accordingly., Character Of Present War, This war differs from previous, wars chiefly in the enormous in, crease in the use of artillery. This, is due partly to the immense manu, facturing resources of the countries, at war, which enables them to pro, duce great numbers 0/ guns and, great quantities of ammunition. It, is due also to the new methods of, directing gun fire from airplane., It is evident that a gun can not, be accurately aimed\' at an object the, exact location of which is unknown., The airplane, however, is able to, bring back or signal back this in, formation, so that the artillery may, now ik> used with much greater ef, fect. The size of the guns and the, force o* thi? explosive shells fired, from them have also been largely, increased., Partly as a result of these im, provements in artillery, it has, been necessary to develop better1, methods of protection., The cnief improvement in meth, ods of defending entrenched troops, in the increased use of machine", guns. Machine guns must be put, of operation by artillery fire or by, rifle fire directed against the gun, ners before infantry can advance, directly against them., Development OC Airplanes, The chief new instrument of war, fare developed during the present, war is th* airplane. As previously, explained, it is used for scouting, d.\', recting gunfire, and dropping bombs., The scouting machine is usually, equipped with a large camera which, takes a series of pictures. When, these otetures are developed and, compared day by day they give in, valuable information as to the exact, location of troops, guns, and1 sup, lilies. The scouting and bombing, [machines are usually protected by, Iswift fighting machines., | Another very interesting and, \'promising device is the "tank" —, a heavily armored machine so con, structed that it can advance under, its own power over almost any ob, stacles, and thus lead an attack on, j enemy trenches. It is armed with, machine guns. Armored motor cars, (have 3lso been used effectively uu, der some conditions., Another weapon of the trenches, introduced by the Germans, in,, spite of international agreements, to tae contrary, is poisonous gas., This was at first very effective,, since no defense against it had been, prepared. At the present time,, however, each man in or near the, front carries a gas mask, wnich eu, ables him to meet an attack of., this kind without serious Injury., WOnucrrui sum, Back of the lines the organiza, tion o* the staff branches of the, service has been enormously ex, tended. Railroads are constructed,, uo to within a short distance of the, front. Transport of supplies and, ammunition by motor trucks has, been organized on a big scale. The, medical department have also made, notable gains in methods of treat, ing wounded men, with the result, that » very large percentage recover*, Even in the early months of the, war it was announced that of the, wounded actually treated in French, hospitals 54.5 per cent were returi*, ed to duty within a short time; 24.5., per cent were sent home to com- J, plete \'heir recovery and later re- j, turned to duty; 17 per cent at the, time of making the report were, istMl iu hospitals, with the prob, ability of complete recovery; 1.5, per cent were unfit for further ser, vice; 2.5 per cent had died from, the effects of their wounds., present you can give to a departing, soldier boy or sailor laddie is a, subscription to the newspaper that, will five him an account of the, happenings in Blighty., It will be sent to him first to the, training camp and later will follow,, him regularly wherever h§ goes., For a few cents a day your sol, dier son, friend or lover may have, a continuous record of things back, home., And iow it will hearten and en, tertain him when in trench, camp,, or on board ship!—From, the Buf, falo News. \' 11 • ji .!»••, . _ . 4, M-UJERO PRtfPEKTV HESTOuEl>, All the properties of the Ma, dero family, which had been "inter, vened" temporarily during the per- J, iod that prominent members of, that lamily were in active opposi-|, tion o the government, have been;, restored without reservation, the, condition of the country now being, such that action of this kind is 110, longer necessary.

Other symbolic, dramas followed, though an invisible, observer might have been puaxled for, a key to some of them. One, however,, would have proved easily intelligible., His expression having altered to a look, of pity and contrition, he turned from, the mirror and, walking slowly to a, chair acroeis the room, used his right, hand in a peculiar manner, seeming to, stroke the air at a point about ten, Inches above the back of the chair., "ITaere, there, little girl," he said in a, low, gentle voice. "J didn\'t know you, cared.", Then, with a rather abrupt dismissal, of this theme, he returned to the mir, ror and, after a questioning scrutiny,, nodded solemnly, forming with his lips, the words, "The real thing—the real, thing at last!", He meant that, after many imitations, had imposed upon him. I.ove—the real, thing—had come to l-\'v: Iti the end., And as he turned «<\'. »• murmured,, "And even her nn:. ii\'aiowu!", Seating himself « small writing, table by the window, he proceeded to, express his in-rsonaliiy In something he, considered a poem., Three-quarters of an hour having, •nfficvd for Its completion, he solemnly, signed it and then read it several times, in a state of hushed astonishment He, had never dreamed that he could do, anvthlns like this:, MILADY., I do not know her nunt, Though It would be the ium, Where roBee bloom at twilight, And the lurk takes hta flight, It would be the same anywhere, Where music sound* In air, I wa« never Introduced to the lady I, So I could not call her Lass or Bailie, Bo I will coll her Milady, By the sands of tho *eu, She a 1 \'.v&> a will be, Just Milady to me., —William Sylvanui Baxter, Eaq., July U., Suddenly again that voice:, "Will-eel", To William, In his high and lonely, mood, this piercing summon* brought, an actual shudder, and the very, thought of Jane (with tokens of apple, sauce and sugar still upon her cbeek,, probably) seemed a kind of sacrilege., He fiercely swore his favorite oath, ac, quired from a hero of a work of fiction, he admired, "Ye gods!" and concealed, his poein lu the drawer of the writing, table., "Wlll-ee! Mamma wanes yoct" Jane, hammered on the door., "What you want?" he shouted., Jane explained, certain pauses lull- J, eating that her attention was partially, diverted to another slice of bread and, butter and apple sauce and sugar, j, "Wlll-ee, mamma wants you—wants, you to go help Genesis bring some, washtubs home—and a tin clo\'es boiler, —from the secondhand man\'s store.", "What!", Jane repeated the outrageous mes, sage, adding. "She wants you to harry, —and I got some bread and butter and, apple sauce and sugar for comln\' to, tell you.", Bis refusal was direct and infuriat, ed, but there was a decisive tapping, upon the door, and his mother\'s voice, interrupted;, "Hush. Willie! Open the door, please.", He obeyed furiously, and Mrs. Bax, ter walked in with a deprecating air,, while Jane followed, so profoundly In, terested that, until almost the close of, the interview, she held her bread and, butter aud apple sance and sugar at a, sort of way station on Its journey to, her mouth., "That\'a a nice uuuj w —w, do!" stormed the unfortunate William., "Ye gods! Do you think Joe Bullitt\'s, mother would dare to"— t, "Wait, dearie!" Mrs. Baxter begged, pacifically. "I Just want to explain"—, " \'Explain!" Ye goda!" i» •, "Now, now, Just a minute, Willie!", ■be said. "What I wanted to explain, was why it\'s necessary tor you to go, with Oenesls for the"—, "Never!" he shouted. "Never! Xou, expect me to walk through the public, street* with that awful lookln\' old, nigger"—, "Genesis Isn\'t old," she managed to, Interpolate. "He"—, Bat her frantic son disregarded her., "Secondhand waahtuba!" Jxa vociferat, ed. "And tin clothee boilers 1 That\'s, what you want yout son to carry, through the public streets la broad, daylight! Ye goda!", "Well, there isn\'t anybody else," aha, said. "Please don\'t rat* so, Willi*,, and say \'Is gods\' ao much. It really, Isn\'t nice. I\'m son nobody* 11 notice, you"- . . ., " \'Nobody!\'" His voice cracked in, anguish. "Oh, no! Nobody except the, •whole town! Why, when there\'s any, thing disgusting has to be done In this, family—why do I always huve to be, the one? Why can\'t Genesis bring the, secondhand waghtubs without me?, Why can\'t the secondhand store deliv, er \'em? Why can\'t"—, "That\'s what I want to tell you," she, interposed hurriedly, and as the youth, lifted his arms on high In a gesture of, ultimate despair and then threw him, self miserably into a chair she obtain, ed the floor. "The secondhand store, doesn\'t deliver things." she said. "X, bought them at an auction, and It\'s go, ing out of business, and they have to, be taken away before half past 4 this, afternoon., "Genesis can\'t brln,.; them In the, wheelbarrow because, he says, the, wheel Is broken, and he says he can\'t, possibly carry two tubs and a wash, boiler himself. And he can\'t make, two trips because It\'s a mile and a, half, and I don\'t like to ask him, any, way. And it would take too long, be, cause he has to get back and finish, cutting the grass before your j«pa, gets home this evening. Papa said he, had to! Now, 1 don\'t like to ask you,, but it really isn\'t much. You and, Genesis can Just slip up there and"—, "Slip!" mo.".ned William. "\'Justslip, up there!\' Ye gods!", "Genesis is waiting on the back, porch," she said. "Really It Isn\'t worth, your making all this fuss about.", "Ye gods!" He clas|>ed his head In, his hands, crushed, for ije knew that, the curse wjis upon him and he must, go. "Ye gods!", Genesis and his dog were waiting, Just outside the kitchen door, and of, ail the world these two creatures were, probably the last in whose company, William Sylvanus Baxter desired to, mako a public appearance. The aged,, grayish, sleeveless, neekless garment, which sheltered Genesis from waist, to collar bone could not have been, mistaken for a Jersey., Upon the feet of Genesis were things, which careful study would have re, vealed to be patent leather (lancing, pumps Ions dead and several times, buried, and upon his head pressing, down his markedly criminal oars, was, a once derby bat of a brown not far, from Genesis\' own color, though de, cidedly without his gloss. A large, ring of strange metal, with the stone, missing, adorned a linger of his right, hand, and from a corncr of his mouth, projected an unllghtcd and spreading, cigar stub., And Genesis\' dog, scratching himself, at his master\'s feet, was the true com, plement of Genesis, for, although he, was a youngish dog, he was a dog that, would have been recognized anywhere, in the world as a colored person\'s dog., CHAPTER II., Genesis and Clematis., "^"\\KND tliut dog back:" William, said resolutely. "I\'m not go, yj lng through the streets with, a dog like that, anyhow!", Genesis chuckled. "He ain\' goin\', back," he said. "Ain\' nobody kin make, \'at dog go back. 1 ain\' had him mo\'n, two weeks, but I don\' b\'lieve pres\'dent, United States kiu make \'at dog go, back. I show you." And, wheeling, suddenly, he made ferocious gestures,, shouting, "G\'on back, dog!", The dog turned, ran back a few, paces, halted and then began to follow, again, whereupon Genesis pretended, to hurl stones at lilm. But the animal, only repeated his maneuver., "I\'ll show him!" suid William hotly., "I\'ll show him he can\'t follow me!", He charged upon the dog, shouting, fiercely. The hunted animal, abandon, ing ills partial flights, turned a tucked, under tall, ran all the way back to, the alley and disappeared from sight., "There," said William, "I guess that\'ll, •how him!", "I a In\' bctlln\' on It," said Genesis as, they went on. "He uev\' dill stop fol, Tln\' me yet I reckon he the foll\'lndest, dog In the worl\'. Name Clem.", "Well, he can\'t follow me!" said the, surging William, In whose mind\'s eye, lingered the vision of an exquisite dog, let with pink ribboned throat and a, cottony head bobbing gently over a, filmy sleeve., "Name Clem fer short," said Genesis, amiably. "1 trade in a mandoline fer, him what bad her neck kind o* busted, off on one side. 1 couldn\' play her no, how, an" I found her, anyways. Yes,, auh, I trade In \'at mandoline fer him, \'cause always did like to have me a good, dog. But I d\'in\' have me no name fer, him, an\' this here Bloole Bowers what, I trade in the mandoline to, he say, \\e d\'ln\' have no name fer him. Say, nev\' did know If was a name fer him, \'tall.

He\'ll come, whichever one you, call him, Clem or Clematis, he a In\', carln\' I", Wllllafn\'s suffering eyes were fixed, upon remoteness, and bis lips moved, now and then like * martyr\'*, pro, nouncing inaudlbly a sacred word—, "Milady! Ob, miladyr, Suddenly Genesis broke into loud, laughter., "What I tell you?" be cried, pointing, ahead. "Look ayonnub! No, sub, prea, \'dent United States hisse\'f ain\' go tell, \'at dog stay home I", And there, at the corner before them,, waited Clematis, roguishly lying in a, mud puddle In the gutter. He bad ran, through alleys parallel to their course., There was nothing to do but to give, up, and so the trio proceeded., Nobody, William reflected, seeing, him In such company could believe, that be belonged to "one of the oldest, and best families in town." Nobedy, Wbuld understand that he was not, walking with Genesis for the pleasure, of his companionship until they got, Clematis., the tubs and the wash boiler, when his, social condition must be thought even, more degraded. How frightful that, tills should befall him on such a day., the very day that his soul had been, split asunder by the turquoise shafts, of milady\'s uyet> and he had learned to, know the real thing at last!, "Milady! Oh, milady!", At last he and Genesis set oat on, the return trip from the secondhand, shop, bearing the two washtubs, a, clothes wringer (which Mrs. Baxter, had forgotten to mention), the tin boil, er, and followed by Clematis., There was something really pageant, llko about the llttlo excursion now, and, the glittering clothes boiler, borne on, high, sent flashing lights far down the, street The washtubs were old fash, ioned, of wood. They refused to fit, one within the other, so William, with, his right hand, and Genesis, with his, Wft.carried one of the tubs between, them., Genesis carried the heavy wringer, with his right hand, and he had fasten, ed the other tub upon his back by, means of a bit of rope which passed, over his shoulder. Thus the tin boil, er, being a lighter burden, fell to, William., The cover would not stay In place,, but continually fell off when be es, sayed to carry the boiler by one of its, handles, and be mnde shift to manage, the accursed thing In various ways, the, only one proving physically endurable, being, unfortunately, the most gro, tesque. lie was forced to carry the, cover In his left band and to place his, head partially within the boiler Itself, and to support It—tilted obliquely to, rest upon his shoulders—as a kind of, monstrous tin cowl or helmet., This had the advantage of somewhat, concealing his face, though when he, leaned his head back, in order to ob, tain clearer vision of what was before, him, the boiler slid off arid fell to the, pavement with a noise that nearly, caused a runaway and brought the hot, chceked William much derisory atten, tion from a passing street car., Seen from the roar. William was un, recognisable. but interesting. He ap, peared to be a walking clothes boiler,, armed with a shield and connected, by, means of a washtub, with a negro or, Informal Ideas concerning dress. In, fact, the group was whimsical, and!, three young people who turned In be, hind It out of a cross street Indulged, Immediately in fits of inadequately, suppressed laughter, though neither,, Miss May Parcher nor Mr. Johnnie, Watson even remotely suspected that, the legs beneath the clothes boiler be, longed to an acquaintance. And as, (or the third of this little party. Miss, Parcher\'s visitor, those peregrinating, legs suggested nothing familiar to her., "Oh, eee the fun-ee laundrymana!", she cried, addressing n cottony doglefs, head that bobbed gently up and down, over her supporting arm. "Sweetest, Floplt must see tool Flopit, look at, the fun-ee laundrymans!", "Sh!" murmured Miss Parcher, chok, ing.

It seemed passionately to, urge greater speed, "Walk faster! You got to walk, faster!", "I got plenty time cut \'at grass befo\', you\' pa gits home," Genesis said re, assuringly. "This here rope what I, got my ex try tub slung to Is \'mos\' wo\', plum thew my hide.", Having uttered this protest, be con, tinued to ambulate at tho same pace,, though somewhat assisted by the for, ward pull of the connecting tub., The amusement of the second group, having abated through satiety, the, minds of its components turned to oth, er topics. "Now Flopit must have his, darlln\' lekle run," said Flopit\'s mis, tress, setting the doglet upon the, ground "That\'s why sweetest Flopit, and I and all of us came for a walk, Instead of sitting on the nice, cool, porchklns.
