        <pre>['Locke\'s Theory of Property: \nA Re-examination \nPETER PAUL CVEK \nUniversity of Kansas \nAmong the many contemporary interpretations of John \nLocke\'8 political philosophy, the works of Leo Strauss 1 \nand C. B. Macpherson 1 stand out as having been espe\xad\ncially influential, as well as controversial. Both of \nthese interpretations maintain that Locke was not a \nnatural law theorist, in the traditional sense, and \nthat the purpose of his theory of property was to sanc\xad\ntion the unlimited appropriation and accumulation of \nproperty without concern for the needs of others. 1 \nMacpherson concludes, Locke "went out of his way to \ntransform the natural right of every individual to such \nproperty as he needed for subsistence and to which he \napplied his labor into a natural right of unlimited \nappropriation."* Moreover, he claims that one of \nLocke\'s major achievements was to transform and under\xad\nmine the traditional view of property, which was based \non the assumption that the earth was originally given \nto mankind in common, in order to justify an individual \nright of appropriation devoid of all moral obligations \nto others in society. \nBoth Strauss and Macpherson have argued that \nLocke\'s account of property .represents the ideology of \nthe rising bourgeoisie and is an attempt to provide a \nmoral basis for laissez-faire capitalism. Furthermore, \nMacpherson has suggested that the present difficulties \nof modern liberal democratic theory lie in the contra\xad\ndictions inherent in the "possessive individualism" of \nthe seventeenth century theorists, like Hobbes and \nLocke. The major problem with these theories, says \nMacpherson, is that they presuppose a modern concept of \nindividualism, i.e., a belief that individuals are es\xad\nsentially possessors of rights, freed from all social \nobligations, except for a negative duty of non-inter\xad\nference, a belief that he claims is ultimately detri\xad\nmental to human and social development. \nIn contrast, James Tully* has recently argued that \nLocke\'s conception of property is not to be understood \nin terms of a right in private property, but only as a \nright to use God\'s property for God\'s purposes. "The \nkind of exclusive right which Locke develops," says \nTully, "is the uniquely English concept of the use \nwhich a trustee is said to have in another\'s proper390\nAustegung, V o l . X I . N o . 1 \nI S S N : 0 7 3 3 - 4 3 1 1 \n', 'ty."\' Accordingly, there is no natural right to the \nappropriation of land in itself, but only an exclusive \nright to use the products of one\'s labour. Far from \nattempting to provide a moral basis for laissez-faire \ncapitalism, Locke\'s main ideological aim was to demon\xad\nstrate "that fixed property in land does not have a \nnatural foundation. N T Rather, private property in land \nis a purely conventional right established by govern\xad\nment and based on mutual agreement. The point of \ndeparture for Tully\'s interpretation is the claim that \nLocke was seeking to ground property rights in accord\xad\nance with traditional natural law theory, which typi\xad\ncally treated private property, not as natural, but as \na rational addition to the law of nature and as such, a \nproduct of convention or positive law. \nIt is my contention that these interpretations are \nexamples of what Monson\' calls "nothing but" inter\xad\npretations, i.e., they make the mistake of reducing \nLocke\'s theory to one basic principle, instead of \nrecognizing the complexity of his philosophical pro\xad\nject. On the one hand, Locke did propound a social and \npolitical philosophy which remained firmly rooted in \ntraditional natural law theory; on the other hand, I \nwill argue that he modified this theory in order to \ndefend a natural right in private property. Conse\xad\nquently, if both aspects of Locke\'s thought are fully \nconsidered, it can be shown that although Locke does \njustify private appropriation and accumulation beyond \nwhat is necessary for individual use, this is done, not \nfor its own sake, but in order to bring about the con\xad\nditions of greater productivity and wealth required to \nsatisfy the natural law duty to preserve all mankind. \nThis duty is correlated with the inclusive right that \neach man has to use those things necessary for his own \npreservation, a right which is prior to any exclusive \nright in property, and is the basis of Locke\'s own \nconception of an "original community." It is this as\xad\nsumption of an "original community" that establishes \nthe natural law parameters for the distribution of \nproperty within a just society. In particular, any \nindividual\'8 exclusive right in property is always con\xad\nditioned by a concommitant obligation to others, as \ndetermined by the inclusive right each man has to the \nmeans of self-preservation. What distinguishes Locke \nfrom a traditional natural law theorist, however, is \nthat he also claims that rights in private property are \ncompletely natural, not conventional. \nFor the purposes of this paper, I will assume that \nLocke was neither a disguised Hobbesian nor that he was \nsimply hiding behind traditional terminology, but was, \nin fact, a natural law theorist. 9 What I intend to \ndemonstrate is how the principles of natural law \ndelimit Locke\'s conception of property, by situating \nproperty rights within a complex matrix of interrelated \nrights and duties, both positive and negative; and \n391 \n', 'thereby indicate the true intention of Locke\'s justifi\xad\ncation of a natural right in property. If this project \nis successful, then it can be shown that, contrary to \nthe extreme interpretations advanced by some recent \ncommentators, Locke\'s theory of property is better \nsuited to a defense of what is typically called socialwelfare\ncapitalism. In a time when the underlying \nvalues of liberal democratic society are being subject \nto increasing criticism, not to mention confusion, a \nreassessment of what these values really are is not \nwithout significance. \nI \nLocke begins chapter five of the Second Treatise \nwith the supposition that the earth was originally \ngiven to mankind in common. 1\' Given this supposition, \nwhich is said to be based on both natural law and \nScripture, the problem is to demonstrate how anyone \ncould ever come to have a property in any particular \nthing. Locke*8 purpose, then, is to solve this problem \nby showing "how Men might come to have a property in \nthe several parts of that which God gave to Mankind in \ncommon." (2.25) In the next paragraph, Locke restates \nthe problem, adding that since the earth was given to \nmankind in common, no one originally had a "private \nDominion, exclusive of the rest of Mankind." (2.26) \nLocke\'8 solution, of course, is the labour theory of \nownership; for whatever a man mixes his labour with, he \nremoves from its natural state and makes it his own \nproperty. \nWhile most commentators are as anxious as Locke ap\xad\npears to be to provide an analysis and justification of \nprivate property, my immediate intention is not to cri\xad\ntique the solution, but to examine the basic supposi\xad\ntion that underlies the problem itself. How does Locke \nunderstand the proposition that the earth was given to \nmankind in common? Chapter five seems to furnish lit\xad\ntle insight into the content of this proposition. Most \ncommentators are equally unenlightening. 1 1 Macpherson, \nfor example, merely reminds his reader that the belief \nin an "original community" was the traditional view, \nfound in both medieval and seventeenth century Puritan \ntheory, and then adds that Locke accepted this position \nonly to refute the conclusions usually drawn from it, \nwhich had made property "something less than a natural \nindividual right." 1 1 Although Macpherson is correct in \nobserving the traditional character of this view, such \nan observation adds very little to our understanding of \nit, since there was no common consensus amongst natural \nlaw theorists as to its precise meaning. \nIn this section of the paper, I will outline two \npossible interpretations of the proposition that origi\xad\nnally the earth was given to mankind in common. The \nfirst interpretation is that provided by the late six392\n\n', 'teenth century Spanish Jesuit, Francisco Suarez, who \nproduced one of the best summaries of the political \nphilosophy of Neo-Thomism. Samuel Pufendorf, a German \nProtestant, who attempted a reconstruction of natural \nlaw theory in the latter portion of the seventeenth \ncentury, will furnish the material for the alternative \ninterpretation. This will be followed, in the second \nsection, by an attempt to ascertain the interpretation \nwhich Locke himself must have assumed, and a considera\xad\ntion of how this position would condition his concep\xad\ntion of the right in property. It should be noted \nthroughout this discussion that, despite our differ\xad\nences in interpretation, I am greatly indebted to the \nexcellent historical analyses of Locke and other seven\xad\nteenth century natural law theorists recently provided \nby James Tully and Richard Tuck. 4 1 Both of these works \nhave established new standards for the understanding \nand appreciation of Locke\'s philosophical enterprise. \nThe notion of an "original community" is defined by \nSuarez in terms of the conception of a subjective right \n(ius). In his De Legibus ac Deo Legislatore (1612) \nSuarez presents a two-fold analysis of the concept of a \nsubjective right: \n. . . . this name is properly wont to be bestowed \nupon a certain moral power which every man has, \neither over his own property or with respect to \nthat which is due to him. For it is thus that \nthe owner of a thing is said to have a right \n(ius) in that thing, and a labourer is said to \nhave that right to his wages by reason of which \nhe is declared worthy of his hire. Indeed, this \nacceptation of the term is frequent, not only in \nlaw, but also in Scripture; for the law dist\xad\ninguishes in this wise between a right (ius) \n|already established] in a thing and a right to a \nthing . . . \nAccording to this analysis, a subjective right desig\xad\nnates either that which is rightfully one\'s own or that \nwhich is rightfully due to a person. In other words, \nwithin the conception of a subjective right two senses \nmay be distinguished: (1) a right already established \nin a thing (ius in re) and, (2) a right to a thing (ius \nad rem). The right to a thing may be conceived as a \nmorally valid claim to that which is due to a person as \na matter of justice, but which he does not yet possess. \nThe right in a thing is a right in that which morally \nbelongs to a person, and which he does, in fact, \npossess. In either case, a person is related to some \nthing in a way that is morally justified, although the \nexact nature of the relationship varies in each case. \nThis dual relationship is rooted in the particular \nsense of "justice" as that which renders unto each per\xad\nson that which is his due. \n393 \n', 'Again, it would seem that iua is so understood in \nthe Digest in the passage (I.i.10), where justice \nis said to be the virtue that renders to every \nman his own right (ius suum), that is to say, the \nvirtue that renders that which belongs to him. \nAccordingly, this right to claim (actio), or \nmoral power, which every man possesses with \nrespect to his own property or with respect to a \nthing which in some way pertains to him, is \ncalled iua; and appears to be the true object of \njustice \nSuarez then applies this dual conception of a sub\xad\njective right to the notion of an "original community n \nwhich he describes in the following way: "nature has \nconferred upon men in common dominion over all things, \nand consequently has given to every man a power to use \nthese things; but nature has not so conferred private \nproperty rights in connexion with that dominion . . . \nFollowing Aquinas, he notes that the institution \nof private dominion (exclusive property rights) is not \nopposed to natural law, but is merely a rational addi\xad\ntion to the law of nature, based on human agreement. 1 7 \nThis is not to say, however, that a positive right to \nproperty did not exist prior to the division of the \ncommon stock, for within the "original community" every \nman has a positive right to those things existing in \ncommon. "Common ownership of property would also per\xad\ntain in a certain sense to dominion held by men by vir\xad\ntue of natural law, if no division of property had been \nmade, since [in that case] men would have a positive \nlaw and a claim to the use of common property \n. . . ."" According to this notion of a "positive \ncommunity," each man has a positive right (ius ad rem) \nto use the things of the earth, a right to his due; a \nright to be included, not excluded, from the use of the \ncommon stock. Moreover, the (exclusive) right in a \nthing (ius in re) is simply the realization of this \nprior (inclusive) right to one\'s due (ius ad rem). \nIn contrast with this notion of a "positive commu\xad\nnity," Pufendorf suggests a very different view of \ndominion in common, that of a "negative community." In \nhis De lure Naturae et Gentium, he argues that the \n"right" of the first man (Adam) over all things was not \na dominion in the proper sense of the word, but an \n"indefinite dominion not formally established but only \nconceded, not actually, but potentially so." 1\' With \nrespect to Adam, there was neither private dominion nor \ncommon dominion, but "indefinite dominion." According \nto this latter notion, "things are said to be nobody\'s, \nmore in a negative than a positive sense; . . . . They \nare, furthermore, called \'things that lie open to any \nand every person\'."" \nPufendorf has, in effect, reduced the notion of \ndominion to that of private property, an exclusive \n394 \n', 'right based on mutual agreement. Since he equates \n"dominium" with "proprietas," common property is than \nreferred to as "indefinite dominion" or "negative com\xad\nmunity." It is not that the earth originally belongs \nto everyone, each man having a right to use what he \nneeds. Rather, the earth belongs to no one, with each \nman having the ability to acquire exclusive property \nrights. 8 1 \nThe difference between these two conceptions of \n"original community" is subtle, but significant. A \nclassic example borrowed from Cicero\'s On Ends may help \nto illustrate this point. 2 1 If I choose to attend a \npublic lecture, the seats in the hall are open to all. \nWhen I occupy one of the available seats it becomes my \nown, that is, I have an exclusive right to use it and \nothers have a negative duty not to interfere with my \nuse. . But what is to occur once all of the seats have \nbeen occupied and there are still others who wish to be \nseated? On Suarez\'8 reading of the right to the com\xad\nmon, those remaining still retain their right to be in\xad\ncluded in the use of the hall, even after all of the \nseats have been occupied. If they are to be treated \njustly, i.e. given their due, it would appear that \nthose with seats have an obligation or duty to\' accomo\xad\ndate their claim, in some way. On Pufendorf\'s reading, \nhowever, once all of the seats have been occupied, the \nremaining individuals have no positive claim to be in\xad\ncluded in the use of what was previously open to all. \nThose with seats, therefore, have no duty to give them \ntheir due, although they may attempt to accomodate them \nfrom feelings of charity. \nI will conclude this section with one last illus\xad\ntration of the significance of "positive community," \nthis time taken from Hugo Grotius\' De Jure Belli ac \nPaciB. 2 1 In this text, Grotius asks whether men in \ngeneral possess any right over things which have \nalready become the exclusive property of another. He \ncomments that this appears to be a strange question, \nsince it would seem that the right of private ownership \nhas completely absorbed the right which had its origin \nin the state of community. Responding to this \nquestion, however, Grotius argues that such is not the \ncase, for one must consider that the intention of those \nwho introduced private ownership was to deviate as lit\xad\ntle as possible from natural equity. Hence it follows, \n"That in direst need the primitive right of users \nrevives, as if community of ownership had remained." 2* \nThe reason for this is not based on charity, but \njustice; it rests on the demands of a prior right to \none\'s due, for "all things seem to have been dis\xad\ntributed to individual owners with a benign reservation \nin favour of the primitive right." 2\' \nThe above illustration is based on the assumption \nthat Grotius accepted some conception of a "positive \ncommunity." It should be noted, however, that this as395\n\n', 'sumption is subject to considerable dispute among \ncommentators.*\' The key to the resolution of this is\xad\nsue is found in an earlier text entitled De lure \nPraedae in which Grotius analyzes the concepts of \n"dominium11 and "proprietas." In this analysis, Grotius \nstates that according to the usage of his own day these \ntwo concepts are identical in meaning, that is, both \nrefer to a right of exclusive ownership. Mow if \nGrotius maintained that this usage exhausted the mean\xad\ning of "dominium" then, like Pufendorf, he would have \nhad to reject the notion of a "positive community" with \n"common dominion." However, Grotius goes on to argue \nthat: "because of a certain degree of similitude and \nby analogy, the above-mentioned expression descriptive \nof our modern customs are applied to another right, \nwhich existed in early times."*\' According to this \nearlier usage, "dominium" denotes "the power to make \nuse rightfully of common property."** In this way, \nnatural man, prior to the establishment of exclusive \nproperty rights, can be said to possess an inclusive \nright to use what is necessary for his subsistence. \nSuch a right is analogous or similar to that of an ex\xad\nclusive right. And although this "primitive right" \nseems to have been absorbed by exclusive property \nrights, it can be revived in cases of extreme need. \nConsequently, Grotius appears to be much closer r.o \nSuarez, then to Pufendorf and Hobbes, in advocating \nsome conception of an inclusive right to common pro\xad\nperty, at least by analogy. All of them agree, how\xad\never, that exclusive property rights are the product of \nconvention, based on common consent, and therefore, \nfall under the jurisdiction of positive law. \nII \nAs previously stated, Locke assumes a conception of \nan "original community" in his discussion of property \nin the Second Treatise. He does not, however, clearly \ndefine what this concept means nor does he explicitly \ndistinguish between the notions of a positive or nega\xad\ntive community. By a brief examination of Locke\'s com\xad\nments on Scripture directed against Filmer in the First \nTreatise, and particularly through an analysis of \nLocke\'8 running discussion of natural law in the Second \nTreatise, I intend to show that Locke must have assumed \nthe notion of an original "positive community." I will \nthen indicate how such an assumption would necessarily \ncondition his understanding of the right in property. \nPart of Locke\'s aim in the First Treatise was to \nrefute Filmer*s contention that according to 1 Gen. 28, \nGod had granted to Adam (and his successors) the right \nof private dominion over the whole earth, exclusive of \nall other men. Like Pufendorf, Filmer equates dominion \nwith private property. But instead of acknowledging \nthe existence of an original "negative community" \n396 \n', 'Filmer maintains that Adam was given an exclusive right \nof private property over the earth. To counter this \nclaim, Locke argues that whatever dominion Adam had, \n"it was not a Private Dominion, but a Dominion in com\xad\nmon with the rest of Mankind." (1.29) Thus Locke reas\xad\nserts the traditional view of an "original community," \nalthough he does not state explicitly what sort of com\xad\nmunity he has in mind. Various passages, however, tend \nto suggest that he supposed that of a "positive \ncommunity." For instance, this God given common domin\xad\nion is described in terms of a right to use the pro\xad\nducts of the earth as a means of self-preservation. \n"God gave his sons a Right to make use of the Earth for \nthe support of themselves and Families." (1.37) Again, \n"God . . . himself gave them all a Right, to make use \nof the Food and Rayment, and other conveniences of \nLife, the Materials whereof he had so plentifully \nprovided them." (1.41) By admitting a right to use the \nearth, prior to the establishment of exclusive property \nrights, Locke\'s Scriptural remarks seem, at least, to \nfavour the notion of a "positive community." \nOnce Locke has shown that common dominion is in \nagreement with Scripture, he must also demonstrate that \nthe notion of an original "positive community" is in \naccordance with natural law. Consistent with the tra\xad\ndition of natural law theory, Locke states, in various \nways throughout the Two Treatises, that the fundamental \nlaw of nature is that mankind ought to be preserved." \nThe validity of this appeal to natural law is not \njustified by Locke, he merely notes that "it is certain \nthere is such a Law" and that it is "as intelligible \nand plain to a rational Creature, and a Studier of the \nLaw, as the positive Laws of Common-wealths, nay possi\xad\nbly plainer." (2.12) Such a reluctance on the part of \nLocke to undertake a formal defense of natural law \ntheory has led some commentators to deny that Locke \nreally was a proponent of natural law. The task of \npresenting Locke\'s credentials as a natural law theor\xad\nist is, of course, beyond the scope of this paper. In \nlieu of such a defense, I will continue to take Locke \nat hi8 word, considering what he actually says, not \nwhat he may have wanted to conceal by such words. \nAccording to Locke, "the fundamental law of Nature \n(is) the preservation of Mankind." (2.135) Although \nstated in general terms, such a law or principle is \nmeant to serve as a rational rule or guideline which \ndirects human activity toward its proper end, and as a \n"law," one is said to be obliged or bound to act \naccordingly." At this level, the end or purpose under \nconsideration is the preservation of mankind. By \nreformulating this principle as "all the Members of the \nSociety are to be preserved" (2.159) Locke indicates \nthat the "end" is to be understood in both its collec\xad\ntive and distributive senses; not only is the human \n397 \n', 'species to be preserved, but each member of that class \nis to be preserved as well. \nGiven the general character of this principle of \naction, it is not immediately evident what particular \nactivities are morally obligatory in order to guarantee \nthat the "end" be achieved. To satisfy this need, \nLocke manages to generate a complex web of interrelated \nrights and duties, thus defining in more detail certain \ntypes of normative behaviour. 1 1 To begin with, eaqh \nindividual is said to have "the right to self-preserva\xad\ntion." (2.11) And as one might expect, this right is \ncorrelated with the negative duty on the part of others \nnot to interfere with the exercise of that right by the \nright holder. In general, "no one ought to harm \nanother in his life, Health, Liberty, or Possessions." \n(2.6) Thus far, Locke has said nothing that a typi\xad\ncally "modern" natural rights theorist would find \nobjectionable. Locke, however, restates this right of \nself-preservation in terms of a duty, i.e. "every one \n. . . is bound to preserve himself." (2.6) Hence, the \nright of self-preservation is also a duty which obliges \nthe individual to preserve himself in existence. It is \nnot a right which one is free to exercise or not, for \nno man is at liberty to terminate his own life. \nLocke\'s translation of the right of self-preserva\xad\ntion into a corresponding duty is justified by the fol\xad\nlowing argument: (1) each man\'s life is the product of \nGod\'s creative labour. Assuming the labour theory of \nownership, (2) each man\'s life is not properly his own, \nbut the property of God, its maker. And since (3) no \nman has a right to destroy that which does not belong \nto him, (4) no man has a right to destroy his own life. \nFurthermore, the right not to destroy one\'s life is \nequivalent to the negative duty that one must not in\xad\nterfere with one\'s life by destroying it. When viewed \nfrom the perspective of natural law, this negative duty \ncan be transformed into a positive duty: for if the \nlaw of nature commands that each man be preserved in \nexistence and it is morally wrong to act contrary to \nthat command, and moreover one is obliged to act ac\xad\ncordingly, then it is also one\'s positive duty to ac\xad\ntively pursue that end. Consequently, each man has the \npositive duty to preserve his own life. \nIn addition to the duty to preserve oneself in be\xad\ning, every one has a similar duty "to preserve the rest \nof Mankind." (2.6) Locke also refers to this as "the \nRight (each man) has of Preserving all Mankind." (2.11) \nAlthough Locke does not explicitly explain how this \nduty is derived, it appears to follow from the original \ndictate of natural law, this time from its collective \naspect. If the end designated by natural law is the \npreservation of all mankind, then one\'s behaviour must \nbe normatively directed toward the realization of that \nend, both positively and negatively. Hence, each man \nhas a negative duty not to interfere with the preserva398\n\n', 'tion of his fellow man, as well as a positive duty to \npromote that preservation, in so far as he is able; \nboth duties being designed as a means of preserving \nmankind as a whole. \nTo summarize: if the law of nature commands that \nall men ought to be preserved, then all men are equally \nobligated to work toward the realization of that end. \nIt has been shown that such an obligation entails a \ncomplex of normative behaviour defined -in terms of \nrights and duties, both positive and negative, toward \noneself and others. Anything less would jeopardize the \nfulfillment of this obligation and undercut the funda\xad\nmental law of nature. \nNow, if all men have a right (and a duty) of selfpreservation,\nthen they must also have a right to the \nmeans of preserving themselves. This right is grounded \nin the right of self-preservation, and implies the \nprior right to use those things necessary for the \npreservation of life. For if. one has a duty to \npreserve one\'s life, then prior to the actual acquiring \nof some thing, one must already possess a right of ac\xad\ncess to the available means of subsistence. "He that \nis Master of himself, and his own Life, has a right too \nto the means of preserving it . . ." (2.172) In the \ncontext of the "original community" each man possesses \nthe right to use those things necessary for his sub\xad\nsistence (ius ad rem), a right which is prior to any \nexclusive right in a thing (ius in re).** Locke\'s \nconception of the law of nature, then, appears to sup\xad\nport the notion of an original positive community." \nThis returns us to Locke\'s original problem; to \nshow "how Men might come to have a property in the sev\xad\neral parts of that which God gave to Mankind in \ncommon." (2.5) Our previous analysis, however, places \nthis problem in a clearer light. More specifically, \nsince the earth originally belonged in common to all \nmankind, the problem is to show how an individual might \njustly acquire something as his own, without violating \nthe common right of other men. Locke\'s solution to \nthis problem seems to be something like the following: \nalthough the earth and all it contains was given to \nmankind for its use, "yet being given for the use of \nMen, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate \nthem some way or other before they can be of any use, \nor at all beneficial to any particular Man." (2.26) \nThis right to appropriate, Locke derives from what is \ntypically called the labour theory of ownership.** \nSince "every Man has a Property in his own Person. \nThis no Body has a Right to but himself. The Labour of \nhis Body and the Work of his Hands, we may say are \nproperly his." (2.27) Consequently, whatever a man \nmixes his labour with, he removes from its natural \nstate and makes it his own property. The application \nof one\'8 labour, what is exclusively one\'s own, thus \ntransforms an inclusive right to use what is common \n399 \n', 'into an exclusive property right. "The labour that was \nmine, removing them out of that common state they were \nin, hath fixed my Property in them." (2.28) After \njustifying the appropriation of the produce of the \nearth, Locke applies the labour theory of ownership to \n"the chief matter of Property," i.e. the possession of \nthe earth itself. "As much land as a Man Tills, \nPlants, Improves, Cultivates, and can use the Product \nof, so much is his Property. He by his labour does, as \nit were, inclose it from the Common." (2.32) \nWhat is significant about Locke\'s solution to the \nproblem of individual appropriation is that, in con\xad\ntrast with the traditional natural law account, which \ngrounded private property in consent, he is careful to \nemphasize that individual appropriation is natural and \n"does not depend on the express consent of all the \ncommoners." (2.28) As such, Locke\'s labour theory is a \ncontinuation of his refutation of Filmer begun in the \nFirst Treatise. In this case, he is directly respond\xad\ning to Filmer\'s criticism of those natural law theor\xad\nists who grounded private property in the common con\xad\nsent of mankind.*" \nWhile the right in property is usually derived from \nthe right to self-preservation, it must also be viewed \nin its relationship to the positive duty, not only to \npreserve oneself, but to preserve all of mankind as \nwell. Although each man is entitled to that which he \nhas justly acquired through his labour, such a right iB \nnot absolute. Everyone\'s exclusive right in property \nis conditioned by the inclusive right that each man \npossesses to use whatever is necessary for his own \npreservation. Exactly what this entails is not immedi\xad\nately evident. But at least one consequence of this \ninclusive right is that every man has a positive duty \nto render assistance to those in need, while those in \nneed have a genuine right to receive such assistance. \nLocke makes this conclusion explicit in the First \nTreatise: \nBut we know God hath not left one Man so to the \nMercy of another, that he may starve him if he \nplease: God the Lord and Father of all, has \ngiven no one of his children such a Property, in \nhis peculiar portion of the things of this World, \nbut that he has given his needy Brother a Right \nto the surplusage of his Goods; so that it cannot \njustly be denyed him, when his pressing wants \ncall for it. And therefore no Man could ever \nhave a just Power over the Life of another, by \nRight of property in Land or Possessions; since \n\'twould always be a Sin in any man of Estate, to \nlet his Brother perish for want of affording him \nRelief out of his Plenty. (1.42) \n400 \n', 'Locke further describes this duty to render assistance \nin terms of the relationship between Justice and \nCharity; \nAs Justice gives every Man a Title to the product \nof his honest Industry, and the fair Acguistions \nof hi8 Ancestors descended to him; so Charity \ngives every Man a Title to so much out of \nanother\'8 Plenty, as will keep him from extream \nwant, where he has no means to subsist otherwise \n. . . (1.42) \nIn these passages Locke compares the exclusive right \nthat each man has to the products of his labour \n(justice), with the inclusive right that each man has \nto use those things necessary for his own preservation \n(charity). Both claims are grounded in the natural law \ndictate that commands the preservation of all mankind. \nJustice requires that property justly acquired is to be \nrespected, while charity refers to the "title" each man \nhas to the means of subsistence, as well as the cor\xad\nrelated duty on the part of others to see that this is \nprovided, even if it would require some access to what \none has justly acquired. This is in direct opposition \nto Strauss\' assertion that " . . . need as such is not \na title to property."" For Locke, such a title is \nbased on the right to use those things necessary to \npreserve one\'s life (jus ad rem), a right which" is \nprior to the title derived from one\'s labour (ius in \nre). To argue that Locke sanctions unlimited accumula\xad\ntion without concern for the needs of others is to deny \nwhat Locke explicitly says. Moreover, it fails to con\xad\nsider the general theoretical framework within which \nLocke is working. \nThe reason why Strauss and Macpherson see Locke as \njustifying unlimited accumulation without concern for \nthe needs of others, is that they fail to understand \nLocke\'8 theory of property from within the perspective \nof natural law and an original "positive community." \nSince they do not recognize the existence of a positive \nright to property prior to the establishment of indi\xad\nvidual (exclusive) property rights, they cannot see how \nthe former has priority over the latter. Consequently, \nthey misinterpret the complete significance of Locke\'s \ninitial limitations on private property: (1) use, nonspoilage\n(2.31), and (2) leaving as much and as good in \ncommon for others. (2.27) For while it is correct to \nobserve that these initial limits are "transcended" by \nthe tacit consent to money, this is not to say that \nthey are removed.\'\' Since money does not spoil, the \nconsent to its use does allow the first limitation to \nbe transcended. A man is able to accumulate more land \nthan he is able to use the products of, since it is now \npossible to exchange the surplus for money which does \nnot spoil. This, however, creates the potential for \n401 \n', 'the extension of land-holdings to the point where there \nis no longer any land left to be appropriated—an ap\xad\nparent violation of the second limit. This limit is \nalso transcended in that it is replaced by a new stan\xad\ndard of justice which maintains that since the private \nappropriation of land has led to an increase in produc\xad\ntivity and therefore a greater standard of living for \nall, it is a more just arrangement than that which ex\xad\nisted in the "state of nature," wherein land was unap\xad\npropriated. Macpherson warns that "this assumes . . . \nthat the increase in the whole product will be dis\xad\ntributed to the benefit, or at least not to the loss, \nof those left without enough land. Locke makes this \nassumption."" But for Locke, this is not merely an \nassumption; it is a moral duty imposed by the law of \nnature. \nBoth of the initial limitations on property ac\xad\nquisition were intended to guarantee that the common \nright of all men to the means of subsistence was not \nviolated. With the introduction of money, this right \nis not simply denied; it is re-established on a higher \nlevel. So while it is true that Locke does justify in\xad\ndividual appropriation and accumulation beyond what is \nnecessary for individual use, this is done in order to \npromote the conditions of greater productivity and \nwealth required to satisfy the duty to preserve \nmankind. This process of accumulation is grounded in \nthe prior supposition that private appropriation is al\xad\nways conditioned by the inclusive right of each man to \nuse what is necessary for self-preservation, as well as \nthe correlated duty on the part of others to assist \nthose in need. Locke, therefore, has not gone out of \nhis way to justify an unlimited exclusive right in \nproperty for its own sake. Rather, his justification \nis based on the assumption that the right of appropria\xad\ntion, although greatly extended, is always conditioned \nby the prior inclusive right to one\'s due. In this \nway, the assumption of an original "positive community" \nestablishes the parameters for his understanding of \nprivate property, in accordance with the law of nature. \nBefore continuing this discussion, however, an ex\xad\namination of Tully\'s conclusions are in order. Contra\xad\nry to the above interpretation, Tully has suggested \nthat Locke\'s "property in" is not equivalent to \n"private property," but refers to a conditional right \nto use what has been given by God for man\'s support. 1\' \nOn this reading, labour does not ground private \nproperty rights, but merely serves to individuate one\'s \ninclusive right to the common-stock by transforming it \ninto an exclusive, albeit conditioned, use right. \nThere is, therefore, no right in land as such, but only \na use right in improved land conditioned upon the ap\xad\npropriate use of its products in fulfillment of the \nends established by the law of nature. "This unique \nconstruction," says Tully, "serves to establish Locke\'s \n402 \n', 'main ideological conclusion: that fixed property in \nland does not have a natural foundation. "*• Moreover, \nonce money is introduced and men are able to enlarge \ntheir possessions, no appropriation is justified. It \nis not that the initial limitations on appropriation \nare transcended, rather, individual appropriation it\xad\nself is transcended by governmental determination of \nproperty rights for the common good. The distribution \nof property is then conventional and the consequence of \nman\'8 consent to enter political society. 4 1 \nSince Locke does not explicitly define what he \nmeans by "property," it is difficult to determine the \naccuracy of Tully\'8 claim that "property in" is merely \na conditional use right and does not at least approxi\xad\nmate a full right of private ownership, as I have \nsuggested. The concept of property rights is, of \ncourse, a complex notion involving a "bundle of rights" \nwhich are not always clearly distinguished. 4 8 Locke\'s \nown running discussion of property rights shares this \ncomplexity. Nevertheless, it seems evident that \nLocke\'s notion of property is not easily reducible to a \n"right to use" and nothing more. Even if the primary \nfocus of Locke\'8 account is to establish (through \nlabour) an individual\'s right to use some thing, it is \ndifficult to imagine what such usage would mean if it \ndid not imply a right to appropriate or possess that \nthing as well. As we have seen, Locke\'s right in \nproperty includes a right to exclude others from use, \nat least when such exclusion is not life threatening. \n(2.6) Locke repeatedly insists that one\'s property \ncannot be taken without one\'s consent. He also notes \nthat the right in property includes the power of transmi\nssibilty, since every man has a right to "the fair \nAcquisitions of his Ancestors descended to him." (1.42) \nOf course, the distinctive stipulation is that one also \nhas a duty to use one\'s property productively for the \ncommon good. But I do not see how this condition de\xad\ntracts from the conception of property rights as rights \nof ownership. Rather, it merely adds to the list of \n"rights" a duty of productive use, and there seems to \nbe nothing incompatible in holding that owners of pri\xad\nvate property incur a duty to use that property for the \nbenefit of society. 4\' While this enumeration of \nproperty rights (and duties) does not constitute a con\xad\nclusive argument against Tully\'8 analysis, it does, I \nthink, render it somewhat doubtful. \nMore importantly, it is not at all clear that Locke \nintended to claim that property rights are completely \n"determined" by government within political society. \nRather, the role of government is to preserve and regu\xad\nlate property for the common good; i.e., in accordance \nwith the principles of natural law. (2.45) This is not \nto ignore the fact that not all of Locke\'s statements \nare perfectly consistent. For instance, he appears to \nconflate this distinction between "determination" and \n403 \n', '"regulation": "For in Governments the laws regulate \nthe right of property, and the possession of land is \ndetermined by positive constitutions." (2.50) But, as \nI have already argued, Locke\'s major innovation in tra\xad\nditional natural law theory was to make property nat\xad\nural and antecedent to government, while still remain\xad\ning within a natural law context. The natural founda\xad\ntion or justification of an individual\'s property is \nhis labour, for his labour is "perfectly his own." \n(2.44) And it is the natural condition of human life \nas requiring labour which "necessarily introduces pri\xad\nvate Possessions." (2.35) Nowhere do I find Locke say\xad\ning that such natural aquisition is eventually invali\xad\ndated, only to be re-established by government. With \nthe tacit consent to money, a man is able to enlarge \nhi8 possessions, yet Locke is careful to point out that \nthis is not an injustice to anyone, nor does it demand \nthe abandonment of natural appropriation, as long as \nthis increased wealth is properly used. (2.46) In this \nsituation of increasing wealth and diminishing natural \nresources, the task of government is not to invalidate \nthe natural process of appropriation, but to guarantee \nthat property be used to satisy the natural law dictate \nto preserve all mankind. As always, property rights \nand duties must be understood from within the parame\xad\nters set by the law of nature. \nThe problem now is to ascertain more precisely what \nthese parameters are in their application to given con\xad\ncrete situations. As previously stated, Locke claims \nthat an individual\'s exclusive right in property is \nconditioned by the inclusive right of those in need to \nuse what is necessary for their self-preservation. \nThis latter right could take a variety of forms, al\xad\nthough Locke does not clearly specify what these forms \nmight be. In the First Treatise he simply compares the \nclaims of justice and charity, pointing out that each \ngenerates a "title" to something: the first based on \nthe just deserts of one\'s labour, the second on the \nrequired satisfaction of one\'s fundamental needs. In \nthe Second Treatise, Locke again repeats these two \nclaims, this time in terms of inclusive and exclusive \nright8: \nNow of those good things which Nature hath \nprovided in common, every one has a Right (as \nhath been said) to as much as he could use, and \nhad a Property in all that he could effect with \nhis labour: all that his Industry could extend \nto, to alter from the State Nature had put it in, \nwas his. (2.46) \nIn neither case does Locke explain how these two \nequally valid moral claims are to be sorted out. It is \none thing to demonstrate how one\'s common right to use \nthings can be transformed into a property right in some \n404 \n', 'particular thing through labour, and this, of course, \nis Locke\'s primary concern in the Second Treatise. But \nonce most, if not all, of the land has been appropri\xad\nated; what does one\'s inclusive right entitle one to, \nhow is this right to be satisified, and to whom is this \nright ultimately addressed? 1 will attempt to answer \neach of these questions in turn. \nThus far it has been determined that an inclusive \nright entitles the right-holder to use what is neces\xad\nsary for the preservation of his life. For Locke, the \nmeasure of what is necessary is fixed by the conditions \nof life as they exist in the "state of nature," i.e., \none is entitled to whatever is necessary to preserve \none\'8 life at the (natural) level of subsistence. The \nestablishment of this measure is part of Locke\'s \noverall justification of unlimited accumulation of \nproperty, even when the results of such accumulation \nare inequalities in holdings. For such accumulation is \njust if and only if the least advantaged individuals \nare benefited or at least are made no worse off than \nthey would have been if property had not been \nappropriated. In other words, their standard of living \nis at or above what it would have been in the baseline \nsituation of the "state of nature."** It is for this \nreason that Locke observes that an Indian in America, \nwhere land has not been appropriated,.is worse off than \na day-labourer in England, where most of the land has \nbeen appropriated. (2.41) Given this fact, the appro\xad\npriation of land in England is justified, even though \nit did not, in any direct sense, leave as much and as \ngood for others. Nonetheless, every individual is \nstill entitled, by right, to the means of subsistence. \nBefore considering how this right is to be satisfied, \none further comment is in order. \nWhether or not this minimal (subsistence-level) \nstandard would be acceptable to the moral conscience of \na modern industrialized society is perhaps doubtful, \nalthough it may have seemed quite obvious to Locke\'s \ncontemporaries. Since standards of living are, for \npractical reasons, dependent upon the real development \nof economic power, the minimally acceptable standard of \nliving may also be somewhat relative. In a developing \neconomy, for example, one might expect that the least \nadvantaged would be increasingly better off. If what \nconstitutes "need" cannot be defined in absolute terms, \nbut is relative to the levels of social and economic \ndevelopment, then "need" could ultimately mean whatever \nis necessary for an individual to enjoy a decent stan\xad\ndard of living as determined by a general moral consen\xad\nsus and available economic resources. In order to meet \nthis standard, a variety of redistribution schemes may \nbe justified. Finally, I am inclined to believe that a \nsimilar conclusion is at least implicit in Locke\'s \nconcern, not only for the right to property, but for \nthe right to life and liberty as well; for these rights \n405 \n', 'can only be enjoyed effectively under conditions which \nsurpass the level of mere subsistence.** \nThe right to use what is necessary for the preser\xad\nvation of life may be satisfied in a number of ways. \nIn a situation where all the land has not been appro\xad\npriated, individuals could be granted access to what is \nstill available. Where most of the land is already \nowned, a variety of options remain open. Locke assumes \nthat under such conditions, the opportunities to obtain \nthe means to life are greater than they would be in the \nunimproved natural state. Those without land should \nhave sufficient opportunities to sell their labour in \norder to obtain the necessities of life. However the \nminimal standard of life is determined, the labourers \nwould be entitled to a just remuneration for their ef\xad\nforts. Moreover, those who are unable to obtain their \nown means of subsistence, through no fault of their \nown, are still entitled to whatever is appropriate to \npreserve their lives. This obligation might be ful\xad\nfilled by direct transfers of goods or payments to \nthose in need. \nDoes this mean that one is morally required to give \nup or share what one has justly acquired, either by \nlabour or inheritance? In part, this question has al\xad\nready been answered. One\'s right to property is never \nabsolute, it is always dependent upon the condition \nthat one\'s ownership does not worsen the position of \nothers. As we have seen, according to Locke, "charity \ngives every Man a Title to BO much out of another\'s \nPlenty, as will keep him from extream want, where he \nhas no means to subsist otherwise . . ." (1.42) The \nquestion now is exactly who has the duty to satisfy \nthis right. \nIf, as Locke says, individuals in the "state of \nnature" have rights and duties which are derived from \nthe moral principles of natural law, and if the "state \nof nature" consists of individuals prior to the estab\xad\nlishment of civil government, then these rights must be \naddresssed to other individuals. Such rights, espe\xad\ncially the right of self-preservation, imply both posi\xad\ntive and negative duties on the part of other men. \nAmong the rights which individuals have in the "state \nof nature" is the "executive power" to punish violators \nof the law of nature. Given the obvious difficulties \nin guaranteeing fair judgments in this situation, Locke \nargues that civil government is the proper remedy for \nthe inconveniences of the "state of nature." (2.13) \nNow, one might add to the list of inconveniences, \nthe problem of guaranteeing that each individual is \nprovided with the appropriate means of subsistence. \nFor if an individual finds himself in need, then he is \nentitled to assistance from those who have enough. But \nwhich individual is required to act is subject to a \nvariety of contingent factors. In order to be obli\xad\ngated to assist someone in need, one must possess the \n406 \n', 'means of rendering assistance. Furthermore, one is not \nobligated to assist another in need, if the providing \nof aid would reduce the provider to a similar state. \nThis condition is in accordance with Locke\'s claim that \nevery one has a duty to preserve himself, and "so by \nthe like reason when hia own Preservation comes not in \ncompetition, ought he, as much as he can, to preserve \nthe rest of Mankind . . ." (2.6) Even if these condi\xad\ntions are met, for practical reasons, one must be in \nsome proximate relationship to the needy individual in \norder to be able to provide assistance. If we include \nthese factors among the inconveniences of the "state of \nnature," then the remedy for these problems will be \ncivil government as well. Consequently, within a given \nsociety, it is the duty of government to satisfy the \nright that each man has to the means necessary to \npreserve his life. In a just society, organized ac\xad\ncording to the principles of natural law, every indi\xad\nvidual is able to fulfill his respective duty to \npreserve mankind in the most effective manner by the \nredistribution of goods and services, as carried out by \nthe operation of appropriate governmental institutions \nand agencies. These obligations would be guaranteed by \nthe organization of society, "for the end of Government \n(is) the preservation of all." (2.159) \nIf the above analysis is correct, it seems clear \nthat Locke\'s theory of property cannot, without some \ndistortion, serve as a moral basis for the ideology of \nbourgeois individualism and laissez-faire capitalism. \nIn fact, his theory appears to be more compatible with \nthe ideals of social-welfare capitalism, including the \nrole of government to redistribute property in order to \nguarantee a decent standard of living for all citi\xad\nzens.** Ironically, Locke\'s conception of an "original \ncommunity" and the inclusive right of every man to the \nmeans of self-preservation could serve as a basis for \nsome of Macpherson\'s own arguments concerning the con\xad\ncept of property in a real liberal democracy. Accord\xad\ning to Macpherson, "the rationale of property . . . re\xad\nquires the recognition of property as a right not to be \nexcluded—either the right not to be excluded from a \nshare in the society\'s whole material output, or the \nright not to be excluded from access to the accumulated \nmeans of labour."* 7 As I have attempted to show, a \nright not to be excluded is already present in Locke\'s \nown theory and justification of property.** \nNOTES \n\'Leo Strauss, Natural Rights and History, (Univer\xad\nsity of Chicago Press, 1953), pp. 166-251. \n407 \n', 'JC.
