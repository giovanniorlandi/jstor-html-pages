Nancy inquired politely. "Well,\nJim, because- I\'ve been engaged to you\nfor nearly two years doesn\'t seem to\nme any reason why I shouldn\'t let\nother men take me to theaters once\nIn a while. I\'m not a sacrifice, Jim.\nI\'m not cut out for one."\n"All right," said Jim. "I guess I am\nslow, but the girl I marry isn\'t going\nto fool round witfc men like Hooper.\nGive me my- ring."\n"What do you mean? How dare\nyou!" exclaimed Nancy, paralyzed\nwith astonishment. Then she took off\nthe gold band with its solitaire and\nthrew it at him. "There!" she said.\n"Now go and give it to some girl\nwho\'s as slow as you are."\n"Thanks," said Jim, and left her.\nAs soon as he had gone Nancy sat\ndown and cried her heart out- She\ndid love Jim. But Jim was only earn\ning twenty dollars a week in a big\nlaw office, and they couldn\'t get mar\nried on that. And Nancy wa3 book\nkeeper for the Cleaves-Smith com\npany, where Mr. Hooper was depart\nmental manager. He knew how to\ngive a girl a good time. Of late,\nthough, there had been something In\nhis manner that had rather frightened\nthe girl, and once he had Invited her\nto a rather flashy restaurant. Nancy\nhad declined indignantly, but now\nwell, she preferred that sort of man\nto slow, easy-going Jim.\nAs a matter of fact, Jim was to be\npromoted to an important position\nthat fall, at forty dollars. He had\nmeant to keep the news as a surprise\nfor Nancy, but after she had insisted\n\'\'! Know Where He Dines."\njn amusing herself with other men\nhe did not have the heart to tell\nher.\nNow all was over; both saw that.\nfor both had pride, though Jim\'s love\nwas stronger than his pride and Nan\ncy\'s was not. Nancy sat down and\nwrote Jim a letter that made him\nwince. Defiant, reckless, contemptu\nous, it told him that he need not see\nher again, but, if he wanted to, he\ncould look in at Trimble\'s restaurant\non Saturday night, where Mr. Hooper\nwas taking her, "being able to earn\nmoney and not too stingy to spend\nit."\nNancy carefully blotted the tear\nthat fell on her signature and sealed\nthe letter. Then she posted it.\'\nOn Saturday morning Jim\'s employ\ner called him into his private office,\nwhere a little woman in black was\nseated, dabbing at her eyes with a\nwet handkerchief. .\n"Rogers," he said, "I want you to\nundertake a confidential mission.\nThis lady was deserted by her hus\nband in Illinois two years ago.

"But perhaps on Monday\nmorning you could take hei "\n"I can take her tonight," said Jim.\n"I know where he dines. But if\nthere\'s any chance of a row "\n\' I am not that kind of woman,"\ncried Mrs. Hooper. "I believe in love.\nIf my poor husband was enticed away\nfrom me I can win him back the\nmoment I set eyes on him. He loves\nme. but he Is weak."\n"We\'ll strengthen him, Mrs. Hoop\ner," said Jim, smiling. "Where shall\nI call for you tonight?"\nHe met her by appointment and\ntook her to Trimble\'s in a taxicab.\nThe thought of the publicity made\nhim wince; but then. It was for Nan\ncy\'s sake. A survey of the restau\nrant, however, did not reveal Hooper\nor Nancy. .\n"Mr. Hooper, sir?" inquired the por\nter.

LACK OF WINTER WORK ON THE FARM .\nGET THINGS READY FOR NEXT SPRING\nA Little Attention Given to Odd Jobs\nfVIuch Valuable Time When\nSpring Season\nSuggestions.\nBr B. S. Wilson, Farm Su\nTm O THE average farmer winter is\nf considered a time for leisure.\nThere are many things, how\never, that can be done at this season\nthat will increase the value of the\nfarm, and keep up the equipment.\nThe farmer should try to lessen very\nchance for anything to occur that will\ndelay operations when spring work be\ngins; for instance, chop the summer\nsupply of wood.\nKvery farmer should go over his\nmachine\'ry. and make a list of the re\npairs needed When each machine\nwas placed in the shed at the end ot\nthe season, a list should have been\nmade and placed on record as some\nthings are always overlooked, or are\nhard to find after two r thre months\nhave passed. otice, especially, the\nsickles of the mowing machine; have\nthe shares or shovels of the plows and\ncultivators sharpened or replaced with\nnew ones. Sharpen and reset the\nteeth on the harrows\' and examine\nthe binder. Note the condition of\nthe canvases, chains and boxings. Go\nover all of the impl\'-\'nents and re\nplace worn bolts and tighten nuts. All\nof these, and many more, mean loss\nof time when most valuable, if not\nlooked after now.\nA coat of paint will make an im\nplement last longer. Take the wagons\nfor instance; the wheels should be\nthrooughly cleaned and dried, then\nplaced in a hot bath of linseed oil.\nKun the fellows in a pan filled with\noil set over a fire, and use a paint\nbrush to get the oil around the spokes\nat the hub. After filling all cracks\nwith oil, apply a coat of good paint.\nIf you have any equipment that paint\nor repairs cannot make useful, get rid\nof it and get something that can be\nused without being watched all the\ntime. Many farmers have one or two\nhay frames of some description.\nIn many instances these will hardly\nhold together and are a disgrace to\nTHE GRASSHOPPER\nBy Geo. A. Dean.

They were\nprompt in organizing under the diroc\ntion of the Kansas State Agricultural\nCollege, and by putting into operation\nthe methods of control recommended\nby the college they-were successful in\ndestroying the hoppers. Jn fact, there\nhas never been a larger and a more\nsuccessful piece of entomological dem\nonstration work than that in the con\ntrol of grasshoppers carried on by the\nKansas State Agricultural College\nwith the co-operation of their farm\ndemonstration agents, the farmers and\nthe county officials. The entomolo\ngists of the college and the farm dem\nonstration agents who have just made\ni careful examination of the grasshop\nper situation, report that there ara\nnow fewer grasshoppers in Western\nKansas than there has been for many\nyears. In fact, when we consider that\nthe farmer of Western Kansas fed\nto their grasshoppers almost a thou\nsand tons of poison bran mash there\nIs no wonder that there is a scarcity\nof grasshoppers.

The new\ncrop is, however, well adapted to the\nwestern third of the state, and,\nthough grown there only a short time,\nit appears to be very proising Pro\nfessor Call says.\nFeterita is a grain sorghum equal or\nsuperior to milo, though the fodder is\nnot as good as kafir. The heads of\nfeterita are large and erect, being eas\nily harrested. The grain Is larsr\nand softer than kaSr and can be ted\nwithout being ground.\nThe assertions that feterita is\nchinch bug proof are false, Professor\nCall says. It is true that the pests\ndo prrefer other sorghums, and the\nwonderful vitality of the plant en\nables it .to replace the leaves and\nstocks which are destroyed, fcii it\nDuring the Cold Weather Wil!

"\nSMS\n1MB\nNUTMEG AS A PROPHYLACTIC\n.Many-Englishmen \'Are Taking Up an\nAncient Old American Rheu\nmatism Preventive.\nLondon. An extraordinary alleged\n"cure" for rheumatism is being talked\nof here. The cult of nutmeg carrying\nas a sort of charm against the disease\nhas Increased rapidly of late.\n"For a good many years," writes a\nclubman to the Daily Mirror, "a few\npeople have been carrying nutmegs as\na kind of protection against rheuma\ntism, and now many others are follow\ning their example. Consequently there\nhas been an increased demand for\nnutmegs, although the price of them\nhas not gone -up so far. Those who\nhave adopted the cult declare that,\nhowever severely they suffered from\nrheumatism before; all traces of the\ntrouble ceased as soon as they began\nto wear the \'charm,\' and that they nev\ner have any recurrence of the com\nplaint so long as they continue to car\nry a nutmeg on their person. Some\nhave the nut attached to the watch\nchain by a gold clasp and keep it con\nstantly in the watch\' pocket; others in\nneat leather receptacles, which are be\ning made for this express purpose by\nup-to-date Bond street shops.\n"Women and there are many who\nhave caught the nutmeg-wearing craze\noften have the aromatic charm fixed\nin a gold or platinum claw and sus\npended by a light chain from the waist\nor garter."\nA Church of England dignitary who\nhas worn a nutmeg for many years,\nsaid that the belief In the efficiency of\nthe nut to- cure and prevent rheuma\ntism was no mere superstition. He at\ntributed its power to the carminative\nproperties of the oils contained in the\nkernel properties which from time\nimmemorial have been known to the\nnatives, of the Banda islands, whence\ncome nutmegs.\nA London doctor was very skeptical.\n"It is evidently an old fetish revived,"\nhe said. It is ab6urd to imagine that\nby carrying a nutmeg 3-ou can ward\noff rheumatism. You might as well\ncarry a stone and put your belief in\nthat. Still, the nutmeg ha3 certain\nproperties as an antidote to rheuma\ntism. Mixed with rum, its essential\noils make a liniment that I have known\nused with success in what is called\ntropical sore throat a form of tropical\nrheumatism."\nThe representative of a firm of spice\nmerchants said that he had heard of\nthe belief in the nutmeg "antidote."\n"As a matter of fact," he said, "a\nleading member of our firm carries a\nnutmeg about with him and swears by\nit as a \'warder-off\' of rheumatism."\nNo New Englander needs to be re\nminded that the nutmeg as a rheuma\ntism prophylactic has been venerated\nfor centuries In the Eastern United\nStates!\nONE OF FREAKS OF NATURE\nStick-Insect Passes Into a State of\nCatalepsy Instead of Slumber\nDuring Daylight Hours.\nLondon. Professor Schmidt of the\nImperial university of St. Petersburg\nhas been experimenting with a spe\ncies of Phasmid, or "stick-insect." As\na result of his investigations he has\ndiscovered that these insects pass\ndaily into a state of catalepsy, or\ntrance, and that they do not merely\nslumber, or remain instinctively qui\nescent, during the -hours of daylight,\nas has been supposed. The photo\ngraphs show the normal pose of the\nstick-insect when in a cataleptical\nstate, and some of the extraordinary\nIn an Abnormal Position During a\n. Trance; a Stick-Insert Standing on\nits Head; a Position for Four and a\nHalf Hours.\npostures which Professor Schmidt\nmade the creatures-assume. They re\nmained in these abnormal positions,\nwithout movement of any " kind, for\nf rorm one to four, and a half hours ;\nand when their catalepsy passed, they\nshowed no signs of muscular fatigue.\nIt should be added that these stick\ninsects feed at night, on the foliage\nof the plants which they frequent. As\nJrofessor Schmidt points out, their\n.cataleptic state may be regarded as\nan accommodation to a highly de\nveloped protective resemblance. The\nPhasmids can only be awakened arti\nficially by prolonged excitation of the\nnervous system; for example, by con\ntinuous pinching with forceps, or by\nelectric shocks from an induction\ncoil.\nBEE STINGS HALT WEDDING\nMississippi Bridegroom Requires Medi\ncal Treatment Just Before the\nCeremony.\n- Moselle, Miss.

There is no apparent uniform\nity of ideas In the construction of cos\ntumes, except the general approval\ngiven to narrow skirts and big waists.\nAccept these two features, look to the\nOrient for inspiration, and you may\nevolve styles to suit yourself. There\nis no hint to variety and eccentricity.\nThe Turkish pantaloon skirt of\nheavy and supple black satin which is\nshown here is an approved model. .It\nis a picturesque but. not a graceful\ngarment, made to hang about a slim\nfigure. And it takes slimness to the\npoint of attenuation to wear drapery\non these lines, with any success. But\nthe idea of the pantaloon as suggest\ned here brought in a variety of skirts\nwith drapery arranged at the sides In\nthis fashion.\nIn the majority of similar skirts\nless material is used, and in a simpler\narrangement. The front is plain and\nthere is 10 need of the lace under\nflounce at the bottom. Wide fabrics\nare cut in such a way that the skirt\nis narrow at the bottom, draped in\nhanging\' folds about the hips, and\nfinished wth a plain panel at the\nback. This interpretation of the\npantaloon skirt is more pleasing, more\nsimple and far more popular than the\noriginal development, which came\nfrom the Callot salon and which is\npictured in the illustration.\nThe little Turkish jacket worn with\nthe skirt is in blue velvet. It is a\nSHORT DRAPED VRAP\nOF BROCADED SATIN\nGIVES DRESSY EFFECT\nAS-HORT draped wrap of brocaded\nsatin in the paprika color, or a\nmahbgany, with trimming of bands of\nskunk, is among the handsome cloak3\nwhich will serve for day as well as\n\'Ml\nWmmm\nevening wear. Brocaded satins may\nbe had, too, at prices that are not too\nhigh to be considered by the pos\nsessor of an average dress allowance.\nThey axe shown in the richest weaves,\ncosting all sorts of money, also, but\nthere are attractive patterns to be\nhad in the neighborhood of three dol\nlars a yard.\nAn elegant satin is employed In the\nbeautiful model shown here, and hand\nsome martin fur in the bands that\ntrim It. In a light golden brown, in\ntan or gray, but, best of all, in ma\nhogany or paprika, this wrap Is ap\npropriate \'for day wear on dress oc\ncasions and for evening wear.\nIt will prove quite as effective in\nthe less expensive satins and very\npretty in the new fashionable fabrics\nwith velvet-like surface- Skunk furs\nor even less expensive shaggy furs.\nY j v fa 1\n. r : ; r-x-:-:-:-:-.-:-:-:-:-:--.;; ::ve-- : : .-.-:-\nsmart, military looking affair, very\nrich and rather simple. Black vel\nvet and silk ornaments form its dec\noration. The model hangs loosely on\nthe figure and is one of a few suc\ncessful designs which incorporate a\nplain sleeve with arms eye defined.\nSuch a sleeve is shapeless a straight\ntube, saved from ugliness by the in\nsertion of panels and cuff3 of black\nvelvet below the elbow. But it is in\nharmony with the jacket and skirt it\nis true to the original Turkish jacket.\nTo be strictly fashionable, one must\nlook as if the clothes were carelessly\nadjusted. This is a fad of the hour.\nA general falling-to-pieces and don\'t-care-if-I\ndo pose has been adopted by\nsome extremists, but they are few.\nClothing Is soft, roomy and comfort\nable looking and tending more and\nmore toward a graceful draping of\nthe figure.\nIn spite of all this variety and ec\ncentricity of styles, the good looking\ntailor-made suit continues to flourish\nalmost undisturbed by the restless\nstriving for something new. It is\nsomewhat less severe, indulging a lit\ntle in the use of draped lines in skirts\nand roominess in coats. The peg-top\nskirt and the Russian blouse make a\ncombination as smart and up-to-date\nas can be, in the development of tailor-mades.\nA suit of this kind, with\nsoft blouse of silk or lace, borrows\njust enough from the fads of the sea\nson to be quite in the mode, without\nlosing the tailored character which\nso appeals to American women.\nJULIA BOTTOM LEY.\ndyed black may be used for the\nbands.\nThe hat worn with this wrap Is\nlarger than the average and Is made\nof plush and satin. There is a plush\ncovered brim and soft puffed crown of\nsatin. A narrow band of fur, like that\nin the wrap, furnishes a necessary\nfinish at the base of the crown, and a\nshaded plume in an unusual pose\ncompletes the design. It is not a\nshape which all faces can wear, and\na smaller hat would look equally welL\nCampaign for Safety.\nThe vice-president of a great Ca\nnadian railroad has issued a circular\nas a part of the "safety first" cam\npaign of that company which makes a\nthorough and exhaustive study of the\ncauses of accidents and their preven\ntion. He states that the prime mo\ntive of the movement is, to correct un\nsafe conditions and practices before\naccidents have occurred and to inves\ntigate accidents that happen with the\nview of discovering the causes there\nfor and devising corrective measures\nto prevent future accidents of the\nsame kind. ,\nNovel Tunics.\nThe salient feature of the new\nmodes is the extending tunic between\nhip3 and knee, which accentuates the.\nmodern slimness of figure. This tunic\nis not of distinct color from the rest\nof the dress. Some of the tunics dip\ndown at the back, and sometimes form\ntwo box plaits in front, which natural\nly add to the size of the waist line.\nFlowers and butterfly bows oa even\ning dresses tend to -extend this size.\nCross-cut folds are brought upward\nfrom back to front, ending In a bow\nat the back of the waist-\nGowns and Wraps That Glitter. \'\nIn brocades, velvets, silks and the\ninnumerable transparent materials\nthat accompany and complete them,\nthe rage for geld color is all pervad\ning. And in the broches the use of\ngold thread add3 a glitter which,\nagain, is one of the crazes of the sea\nson. Linings for coats are frequently\nIn gold broche, and the new tunica are\noften made of silver cr gold tinted\nninon or mousseline desoie, the band\nof strass or . colored jeweling, round\nthe edge adding its nota to the ecii\ntillating effect. \'\nMANITOBA CROP YIELDS\nGladstone, Man., reports that .the\nwheat crop of 1913 exceeded all ex\npectations, 30 bushels per acre was\nthe general yield.
