        <pre>['VOL. 11. NO. 257.\nWILLIAM WINDHAM\nSUES E. T. MAUK\nAlleges That Defendant Unlawfully\nRemoved Proi>erty Sot His\nOwn.\nOn May l Oth the case of William ;\nWindham vs. E. T. Mauk will occupy\nthe attention of the \'superior court.\nThe trouble grew out of a sale by\nMauk to Windham.\nMauk owned a fruit ranch —a pret\nty place, they say—in the Entiat\ncountry. By and by Windham, who\nis well known locally as the. con\ntractor who erected the Columbia\nValley Bank building, came along\nand wished to buy Mauk\'s ranch.\nMauk said all right.\nWindham alleges that under the\npurchase he was to receive certain\npersonal property and chattels then\non the ranch, and the property of\nMauk, and for which he paid the ad\nditional sum of $1000. But when\nthe purchaser went to take posses\nsion of hi 3 new acquisition the per\nsonal property had been removed.\nThey will fight it out before Judge\nSteiner a week from Friday.\nSheller Goes to Cascade Tunnel.\nler left on the west bound train last\nevening for the region of the Cas\ncade tunnel.\nMr. Sheller goes to meet the engi\nneer corps of the Great Northern\nRailway company, which is now mak\ning surveys on the headwaters of the\nWenatchee river, with a view to lo\ncating that company\'s new water\npower schemes. Superintendent Shel\nler will confer with the company\'s\nengineers as to the probable amount\nof standing timber they shall be ob\nliged to destroy, what amount is to\nbe used in the construction of the\nnecessary flumes, dams, etc., for the\ndevelopment of the 14,000 horse\npower decided upon.\nWhile there the forest superint\nendent will also meet several of the\nnew settlers in that vicinity, and ad\njust stfverU mattaqa, vjes&wMng. tim\nber claimfe, grazing rights, etc. He\nwill return to Wenatchee in a few\nday 3to look after the fitting up of\nthe local forestry office of which he\nis in charge. It is thought that a\ncommunication from Washington\nwill shortly authorize the employ\nment of several local men for fire pa\ntrols, forest cruisers, etc. As stated\nin a late issue of the World these\njobs will pay from 60 to 75 per\nmonth, and & number of local men\nwill be employed.\nTRAIN JUMPS TRACK\nON HIGH TRESTLE\nMiraculous Escape of Great Northern\nPassenpors From Fatal\nAccident.\nStill another wreck on the G. N.\nAccording to intelligence received\nhere this morning, while running at\na high rate of speed, train No. 1 of\nthe Great Northern road left the\ntrack in the center of Two Medicine\nbridge, 75 miles east of Whitefish,\nMont., Monday night. The guard\nrails are believed to have prevented\nthe entire train from jumping into\nthe gulch 200 feet deep. Henry Han\nson, the mail clerk, was bruised on\nthe body and face by the jumping of\nthe mail car, but his injuries are be\nlieved to have been the only ones\nsustained by any one on the train.\nLocal division headquarters have\nbut meagre information regarding\nthe details of the wreck. Enough is\nknown, however, to establish the\nfact that the accident was a most\nmiraculous one, owing to the fact\nthat the engine and the whole train\nstood up after leaving the track. Had\nthey gone over into the gulch noth\ning can estimate the number of kill\ned and injured.\nWas Regulation Train.\nThe train was the regulation No.\n1, with full equipment of baggage,\nmail and express, day coaches, chair\ncars, sleepers and with an observa\ntion car in the rear. It is claimed\nthat the observation car was the on\nly one that did not leave the track.\nWhat was the case of the wreck\nhas not yet been established, but it\ndelayed traffic to such an extent that\nNo. 4 had to take the passengers of\nNo. 1, exchanging her\'s for them.\nThe belated No. 4 turned into No. i.\nreaching Spokane this morning at\n2 o\'clock with the passengers.\nThe place where the wreck oc\ncurred is in the Rockie3, about 350\nmiles east of Spokane and not near\nto any large city. It is on the Kalis\npel division of the road.\nSecond "Lucky" Accident.\nThis is the second time that the\nGreat Northern has fared well when\na train jumped the track. Not long\nago, 100 miles east of Spokane, the\nengine of a fast-moving freight train\nstruck a cow and threw the body\nagainst a switch, throwing it a point.\nThe engine left the track and tore\nup things for 100 feet, but did not\nturn over. Many of the cars were\ntotally destroyed, but no one wa3 in\njured.\nFRUIT CROP IS TOTAL LOSS\nWalla Walla Orehardists Lose Whole\nWALLA WALLA, April 30. —Peo-\nple here are downcast today over the\nreport of the fruit growers, who de\nclare that fruit of all varieties i\'\ncompletely destroyed by the frost.\nThis is the fifth year that fruit\nhas been damaged to some extent by\nthe frosts, and it has the effect to\ndepress values in fruit lands in this\ndistrict, which were making rapid\nstrides. An effort was made to pro\ntect the trees at the Blalock fruit\nfarm near this city by burning piles\nof straw which had been distributed\namong the trees, on the theory that\nthe smoke, hanging over the trees,\nwould serve as a protection, but the\nexperiment proved a failure.\nD. B. Shel-\nDENIES REPORT OF\nFRUIT FAILURE\nSensational Reports S«*nt Out From\nSpokane as to Injury to\nFruit are Denied.\nWill H. Parry this morning re\nceived a strong denial of the sensa\ntional teleghaphic report sent out\nfrom Spokane to the effect that the\nfßuit- crop of the greater part of east\nern Washington had been destroyed\nby a frost on the morning of April\n28. The story indicated that the\ngreater part of the inland Empire\nand the valley fruit districts in east\nern Washington had sustained an\nenormous loss.\n"I have received a wire from the\nTwo Rivers district, in the Colum\nbia river valley, stating that there\nwas absolutely no sign of frost there\ntwo days ago and that the fruit is in\nexcellent condition in the whole early\nfruit belt of the Columbia river,"\nsaid Mr. Parry. "The story sent out\nfrom Spokane was not well founded,\nas it purported to cover the main\nfruit districts of eastern Washington.\nIn the district surrounding the\njunction of the Snake and Columbia\nrivers there wa3 no sign of frost, al\nthough some of the orchards in the\nPalouse country and near the Idaho\nline may have suffered. The report\nin question is calculated to do harm\nto the entire eastern part of the\nstate and is without warrant."—Se\nattle Times.\n\'.cwis-Claike School Meeting May !U.\nClerk Littlefield of school aisr.rici\nX« 46, Lewis-Clarke school, ir.s\ncalled a meeting of the patrons of\nthat institution for Friday night.\nMay 10th, at eight o\'clock, for the\npurpose of determining whether or\nnot the school district shall sell the\nportion of the land which it now\nholds, and acquire another and\nlarger tract.\nIt was voted a few days ago to\nsell bonds for the construction of a\nnew modern brick school building in\nthis district, to cost about $10,000.\nAs published exclusively in the\nWorld at that time, the present\nframe building will be torn down or\nsold.\nGreat Northern is Fined.\nSEATTLE, May I.—ln the case of\nthe United States against the Great\nNorthern Railway for violation of\nthe twenty-four hour law on two\ncounts and one count for lack of\nsafety appliances, the company was\nfined $1000 on each count, together\nwith the costs.\nThe law provides that the railroad\ncompanies shall not keep live stock\non the train for a longer period than\ntwenty-four hours at a time without\nunloading for feed and water. The\nfine is from $100 to $500 for each\noffense.\nSpring Work.\nWENATCHEE, WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MAY 2, 1907.\nFAMOUS GUNN EXEMPTION:\nLAW IS FATALLY DEFECTIVE\nTitle of Laws Must State Object Clearly—\nAll Court Decisions Hold to Exact\nLetter of Constitution\nThe startling discovery has just\nbeen made that the famous Gunn\nbill, introduced in the last legislature\nby Senator Arthur Gunn of Wenat\nchee, through an error amends, in\nstead of the revenue law, a law relat\ning to the defacement of location\nnotices in mining claims, and hence\nwill not stand the test of the courts.\nWhen approached by a World rep\nresentative thi3 morning. Senator\nGunn said he had been advised of the\nmiscarriage of the bill, but had noth\ning to say beyond this:\n"I was with Mr. Easterday in the\noffice of the tax commission when the\ndraft of the so-called Gunn bill was\nprepared. I later introduced it as\nit was prepared there.\n"I took it for granted that the\nfigures given were correct.\n"1 still believe the principle In\nvolved to be right, and hope the\ncourts will hold it to be valid as it\nis. If not, then I trust the next leg\nislature will re-enact the bill."\nThat the Gunn bill exempting\nmoney, mortgages and ocean goins\nvessels from taxation, regarded as\none of the most important pieces of\nlegislation enacted by the last legis\nlature, is hopelessly void by reason\nof a defect in its title is the belief\nof those who have been made aware\nof the astonishing discovery.\nThe Gunn bill appears as chapter\n4 8 of the session laws of 1907 and\nis designed, according to its title, to\n"amend section 3, chapter LXXXIII\nof the session laws of 1897, relating\nto revenue and, taxation. Chapter\nSUBMITS TEMPORARY\nWATER SUPPLY PLAN\nElectric Company Proi>oses to Install\nPumping Plant on Co\nlumbia River.\nA temporary solution of the water\nquestion in Wenatchee seems about\nto be reached.\nAt the request of the city council,\nSenator Gunn, representing the We\nnatchee Electric company, laid be\nfore the council at its session Tues\nday night a plan which has evoked\nmuch favorable comment.\nWhen seen by a World man thi»\nmorning about the new plan, Mr.\nGunn said:\n"Our idea is this: We propose to\nerect a small pumping plant on the\nbanks of the Columbia river, capable\nof supplying the city with from three\nto four hundred thousand gallons of |\nwater daily. We estimate that the\nwhole pumping plant would not cost\nover $2200.00. and that it could be\noperated by electric motor for about\n$180.00 per month. There would\nbe practically no further expense to\nthis project, and we tould have it\nready to run water into the pipes!\nby the middle of July. With the\'\nwater service»which the city already |\nhas, this little project would more\nthan supply the requirements for\nthe next year or so, or until the per\nmanent project can be accomplished.\nAnd the expense is insignificant; it\nwould actually cost the city less for\npower on the small, temporary pro\nject in question than would be paid\nas interest on the Wenatchee river\nproject."\nAt Tuesday night\'s session of the]\ncouncil the plan of the electric com- ]\npany for the construction and in- j\nstallati\'on of the temporary plant was\nthoroughly discussed, and the var\nious members looked with favor oh j\nthe idea. The water committee has!\nthe matter in \'hand, and will meet to\nday with Senator Gunn to discuss it\nin detail. A special meeting of the\ncouncil may be called to go more\nfully into the question, and to hear\nthe report of the committee.\nThe acceptance of the electric com\npany\'s proposition would provide the\ncity with water during the perfec\ntion and execution of its plans for a\npermanent water supply, and the\ncost would not he large. ...\nIt is eattfflated that Th,e temporary\nLXXXIII of the session laws of 1897\nis "An act entitled an act to prevent\nthe destruction, mutiiiation or de\nfacement of land marks, monuments\nand notices upon mining claims, and\nproviding a penalty therefor."\nIn other words, in drawing up the\nbill the wrong chapter number was\nused in reference to the statute to be\namended. That this defect will ren\nder the bil void must be generally\nconceded. Section 19, article II of\nthe state constitution provides that\n"no bill shall embrace more than\none subject, and that shall be ex\npressed in the title," and the courts\nhave heretofore held to the strict\nletter of the law.\nTo amend the law which it intend\ned to amend the Gunn bil title should\nhave referred to section 3 of chapter\nII of the extraordinary session of\n1901 which section-amended chapter\nLXXI of the session laws of 1897.\nThe measure was introduced at\nthe request of J. H. Easterday and T.\nD. Rockwell of the state tax commis\nsion, by Senator Arthur Gunn. It\nhas been accorded widespread ap\nproval throughout the state and the\nfact that it has been found defective\nwil be generally regretted. The law\nhas an emergency clause and hence\nhas been in operation for some time.\nActing under the law the county as\nsessors of the state have been ex\nempting money, mortgages, etc., as\nprovided in the bill, but if the law i ;\nvoid, it will necessitate the supple\nmental assessment of all this class o\'\nwealth.\npumping plant would suffice to keep\nthe city in plenty of additional water\nfor at least two years, and by that\ntime the big system should be in.\nNo More Saloon Employment Offices.\nAt a meeting of the city council\nTuesday night the custom of con\nducting employment bureaus in sa\nloons came up for discussion, and it\nwas decided that this practice should\nbe discouraged. The proper city au\nthorities will call upon the manage\nment of the Depot saloon, in con\nnection with the employment office\nnow conducted in that place.\nInjunction Suit Hearing Today.\nThe superior court is today hear\ning the evidence in the case of Hall\nand Woodruff against F. R. Kist, in\nwhich plaintiffs are suing for an in\njunction restraining the defendant\nfrom following the blacksmithing\ntrade in Wenatchee.\nThe plaintiffs allege that there is\nan agreement existing between the\nparties to the suit, wherennder Ki°*\nstipulates that he will nol, for a\nconsideration, indulge in the black\nsmith\'s art for a period-of years, in\nWenatchee.\nThere is a prejudice in many\ncourts against contracts in restraint\nof trade, and the outcome of the\npresent action is watched with con\nsiderable interest.\nHigh School Basket Social.\nAs anr.<:: •- d\'n yesterday\'s World\nthe studer*\' of ten High School are\nmaking extrusive preparations for a\nrousing rer-ntion to guests at their\nbasket social Friday night.

They say in this way\nWenatchee is different from most\no|her western cities of its size.\nWomen and girls are safe on our\nstreets —they may occasionally over,\nhear objectionable language—but\nthe MASHER is an Unknown Quan\ntity.\nDrunken rowdyism and carousing\nis seldom seen. Occasionally, in the\nstill watches of the night, the racaus\nyell of a homeward bound Jag is\nheard—but not often.\nEvery community confesses to a\nfew lawless, spirits, of course, Who\nsemi-occasionally collide with police\nauthority, and wind up in the bas\ntile.

How much\nMr. Wilson"s department has con\ntributed to this progress is a matter\nof common knowledge.\nNow and then there may have\nbeen some criticism of the depart\nment of agriculture. There has been\n-some criticism of Secretary Wilson,\nnotably during the packing house\nscandals, and on account of the cot\nton report leakage. • But in the main\nthe country will probably not be in\nclined to quarrel with Mr. Wilson\'s\nadministration of the department\nover which he presides. His has been\na record performance, and no strong\ner or more convincing evidence of\nthe fact is needed than may be found\nin the generally improved conditions\nin the country.\nAgriculture has reached a higher\nstandard of development, and has\nprogressed more rapidly, perhaps, in\nAmerica than in any other countrj\nof the world, a fact due largely to\nthe scientific study of agricultural\nproblems by the department at\nWashington, and extensive experi\nmentation carried on fey the state\nand national governments. in all\nthese efforts the secretary of agri\nculture has played an important\npart, and the records testify to the\nrecords achieved. Steady increases\nin the annual yield: improvements in\nthe quality of agricultural products:\nthe reclamation oi arid areas, and\nmore satisfactory conditions general\nly in agriculture, amply support all\nMr. Wilson says in behalf of the\nwork of his department, and in the\npresence of such tacts, special em\nphasis is not ne ided to give weight\nto the secretary\'s claim.—P.-I.\nAt the Theater.\nThe Brandon Company in "The\nTexas Ranger." was greeted by a\nlarge audience last night.

The play, as the name sug\ngests, was a melodrama, but it was\na plausible one and the hearty ap\nplause and curtain calls show that\nthe efforts of the company, which is\nan excellent one, were appreciated.\nMr. Ray Brandon was a typical\ncow boy and his work compares fav\norably with that of Dustan Farnum\nin "The Virginian." He did not over\ndo the part and we of the west, who\nare familiar with the real thing in\nthe way of cowboys, with their jing\nling spurs and chaps, appreciated it.\nMiss Janie Russell was a sweet hero\nine, who is gifted not only with good\nlooks but knows how to act.\nThe comedy role of the judge had\nthe audience with him all the time.\nHis characterization was one of the\nbest pieces of acting seen on our\nlocal stage.

Shake it well every\nnow and then and at the end of the\nday set it away where it will not be\ntouched during the night.\nThe next morning jjour off the water\ninto another bottle, leaving the sedi\nment in the first one. And now, hav\ning provided yourself with some clean\nstraws, such as are used in drinking\nlemonade, you are ready to begin your\nfortune telling.\nAs fortune tellers should not Ite ex\nposed to the public gaze while they\nare engaged with their \'•victims," you\nTHE SOBCEItESS AT WOBK.\nshould take your seat at a table behind\na screen and invite them one at a time\nto consult you there. Before doing\nthat, however, it might be well to pri\nvately fill a wineglass with clear lime\nwater and hold it up In the light for\nthe company to see, telling them that\nit is the fluid of fortune.\nWhen your "victim" seats himself at\nthe table with you, say something like\nthis:\n"The crystal water will tell you the\ntruth. Take this straw and blow\nthrough it in the water as if you were\nblowing bubbles, for, after all. fortune\nIs but a bubble. If you are to bo pros\nperous in life, the water will change to\nmilk, proving that you will live in a\nland flowing with milk and honey."\nIn the course of a minute or two the\nwater will become opalescent and then\nas white as milk, to the wonder of\nyour subject. Caution him to keep his\nsecret, and then you call for the next\nsubject.\nA Grain of Musk.\nIt Is said that a grain of musk will\ndiffuse a perceptible odor through a\nroom for more than twenty years. It\naccomplishes this by filling the air\nwith particles of its substance, but\nso Inconceivably minnte are these par\nticles that if the musk be weighed at\nthe end of the twenty years no loss of\nweight can be detected. That seerus\nincredible, doesn\'t It? And yet nature\ngives us many equally striking exam\nples of what scientists call the divisi\nbility of matter. A grain of copper dis\nsolved In nitric acid will give a blue\ncolor to three pints of water. That\nmeans that each separate particle of\nwater must contain a part of the grain\nof copper, which is thus, it has been\nestimated, divided into about a hun\ndred million parts. The spider\'s web is\nso attenuated that enough of. it to go\naround the earth would weigh only\nabout eitrht ounce.-\', and yet this slen\nder thread is composed of about a\nthousand separate filaments.\nGreece and Rome.\nEvery reader of history is struck by\nthe similarity between the civilization\nof Boom and that of Greece in ancient\ntimes, bat every one does not under\nstand it. It is explained by the con\nstant intercourse between the two\ncountries after the subjugation of\nGreece by the Romans in the second\ncentury B. C. It was from the Greeks\nthat the Romans got their knowledge\nof art, learning and philosophy and\ntheir fanciful system of mythology. In\nfact, Roman civilization was only a re\nproduction of that of Greece on a\nhirgtr gcele.\nGhe DIGNITY\nOF LABOR\nBy THEODORE ROOSEVELT\nFrom the President\'s Latest Book.

Finally,\nwe must ever keep in mind that a republic such as ours can exist only\nby virtue of the orderly liberty which comes through the equal domi\nnation of the law over all men alike and through its administration in\nsuch resolute and fearless fashion as shall teach all that no man i 3\nabove it and no man below it.\nIn our present advanced civilization we have to pay certain penal\nties for what we have obtained. Among the penalties is the fact that\nin very many occupations there is so little demand upon nerve, hardi\nhood and endurance that THERE IS A TENDENCY TO UN\nHEALTHY SOFTENING OF FIBER AND RELAXATION OF\nFIBER, and, such being the case, I think it is a fortunate tiling for\nour people as a whole that there should be certain occupations, prom\ninent among them railroading, in which the man has to show the very\nqualities of courage, of hardihood, of willingness to face danger, the\ncultivation of the power of instantaneous decision under difficulties\nand the other qualities which go to make up the virile side of a man\'s !\ncharacter. These qualities are all important, but they are not all suffi\ncient. It i< necessary absolutely to have them. No nation can rise to ]\ngreatness without them. But by them alone no nation will ever he\ncome great. * * * With the courage, with, the hardihood, with the |\nstrength, must come the power of self restraint, the power of self mar:- i\nt\'-ry. the capacity to work for and with oilier- as well as for oneself,\nthe power or giving to others the love which each of us must bear for j\nhis neighbor, if we are t > make our civilization great.\nWORK. THE CAPACITY FOR WORK, IS ABSOLUTELY NECIS\nSARY, AND NO MAN\'S LIFE IS FULL, NO MAN CAN BE SAID TO\nLIVE IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IF HE DOES NOT\nWORK.\nThis is necessary, and yet it is not enough. If a man is utterly\nselfish, if utterly di?regardful of the rights of others, if he has no |\nideals, if he works simply for the sake of ministering to his own base i\npassions, if he works simply to gratify himself, small is his good in\nthe community. I think even then he is better off than if he is an\nidler, but he is of no real use unless, together with the quality which\nenables him to work, he has the quality which enables him to love his\nfellows, to work with them and for them for the common good of tD.\nEarly this morning Alfred Winston\nBurleigh, the young easterner who\nwas accidentally shot and seriously\ninjured at the Rothrock-Sharp ranch\nlast Friday, was brought to this city,\nand is now under the professional\ncare of Dr. Culp.

Ever since the\nservice has had control of the forests\nthe requirements of administration\nhave steadily increased. Though the\nearlier organization of the work wa?\nchanged several times in order to\nsimplify the conduct of business, it\nat last became necessary for the sake\nof economy of time and effort, to\nmake a more thorough going redistri\nbution of the various lines of activity\nand to reduce the number of heads\nwho report to the forester,\nz The organization which has now\nbeen superseded had ten offices, each\nof which reported directly to the\nchief of the service. According to the\nnew chart there are but four main\nbranches, and the offices, which are\nredistributed under the branches,\nnumber 14. The forester and the as\nsociate forester stand at -.he head of\nthe organization.\nIn the office of the forester are\nseveral lines of work, namely law,\ninformation, dendrology and inspec\ntion. The four great branches are\nsilviculture, products, operation and\ngrazing. The branch of silviculture,\nas the name implies, has to do with\nthe forests as a wood producer. The\nbranch of products includes both all\nquestions of wood utilization and the\npublication of the results of the work\nof the service. The branch of graz\ning permits and the regulation of the\nrange in the national forests. The\nbranch of operation includes ac\ncounts, organization, engineering,\nmaintenance and lands.\nEach of the several offices which\nreport that the branches has a num\nber of sections, charged each with\nsome definite branch of the work.\nThere are 36 such branches.\nMr. and Mrs. Leonard Fowler have\ngone to Seattle.\nFrank Dallam, Jr., left on the\neast bound train last evening for Spo\nkane on his way to Loomis.

Sugar, steel,\noil, tobacco, or at least the trusts that\n| are supposed to control the produc\nj tion and sale of the articles named.\nI are all feeling the probe of the feder\nal trust buster. The trust buster is\nI Herbert Knox Smith, United States\nCommissioner of Corporations.\nThe bureau of corporations is the\npublicity agency of the government;\nit collects evidence upon which future\nprosecutions are based. This was\nwhat was done in the case of the beef\ntrust and of Standard Oil. The bu\nj reau of corporations, or more proper\njly speaking, the commissioner of\nj corporations, started the ball rolling,\n| and Standard Oil was haled into\nI court and indicted on more than a\nj thousand counts. It was upon cvi-\nI dence collected by the commission\njer of corporations that the beef trust\n■found itself confronting prosecutions\n\'■ in the courts of the land.\nPresident Roosevelt once designat-\nISd the tobacco trust as a bad tru-t.\nI The tobacco tru?; became unpopular\n[some years ago. it was charged that\njit ran its small competitors out of\nI business. During the national cam\n. paign the tobacco trust got into some\nsort of a tangle over political con\ntributions. It was charged that the\ntrust offered one of the parties a\nlarge amount of money, in the event\nthat if the candidate of that party\nwas successful at the polls, the trust\nwould not be disturbed. As the\nstory goes the candidate in questiou\nrefused to permit his managers to\naccpt any money bearing the odor of\nnicotine. All of these things were\nbad enough for the tobacco tru3t,\nbut its worst piece of luck came\nwhen the operations were subjected\nto the close scrutiny of the govern\nment trust buster. The trust buster\nis not proceeded in his work of in-j\nquiry by a brass band. He wears\ngum shoes, and is so smooth that he;\ncan walk over a piano board a mile:\nwide and not strike a note. The to\nbacco trust, which is engaging most\nof the time and attention of Com\nmissioner of Corporations Smith\nfeels assured that its business meth\nods will soon be laid bare to the pub\nlic and it does not relish the thought.\nTwo or three year 3 ago the com\nmissioner of corporations began\nlooking into the methods of the su\ngar trust to ascertain just how that\ncombination was enabled to control\nprices and regulate the output, in\nfact, to ascertain just how much su\ngar, an article of every day necessity\nin every household in the Units*! |\nStates came to fall into the hands;\nof what practically amounts to a J\nmonopoly, and if such monopoly j\ncould be broken or controlled by the!\nlaws on the statute boohs. The an-I\nnouncement is made that the report\nof the commissioner of corporations\nin the operations of thes ugar trust\nwill soon be given to the public.\nWhether a suit in the courts will be\ninstituted remains to be seen.\nAlthough it is not generally known\nStandard Oil is still under investiga\ntion by the commissioner of corpora\ntions. The report on that concern\nforwarded to congress a year or so\nago had to do only with its relation\nto the railroads. Commissioner Smith\nis now inquiring into the manage\nment and conduct of Standard Oil,\nthe cost of production, the influence\nof the pipe line as a factor in .mono\npoly building, and export and domes\ntic price of the product. It is stated\non good authority that disclosures\nconcerning Standard Oil more in\nteresting than those that have gone\nbefore will be.\nThe inquiry into the steel trust,\nwhile well advanced, will not be com\npleted for some time to come.\nIn addition to his inquiries into\nthe industries named, Commissioner\nSmith is conducting an investigation\nthat is being watched with great in\nterest. Just before congress adjourn\ned a resolution was introduced in the\nhouse authorizing an inquiry into the\noperations of the New York Cotton\nExchange. At the same time an ap\nplication was made to the postmast\ner general for the issuance of a fraud\norder against the New York institu\ntion. The house resolution was sup\nposed to be directed solely against\nthe exchange, but Commissioner\nSmiih construed it otherwise. He\ndecided that the resolution was aim\ned at all exchanges and association:;\nd -alius in cotton, and he proceeded\naccordingly. This inquiry will be\nbroad in its scope. It will extend\nfrom New York to \\ »v Orleans.\nWhether cotton exchanges actually\ndeal in the product, just what in\nfluences are brought to bear about ,\nfluctuating quotations in the mark .\nand other questions are embraced in j\nthe investigation.\nFROST KILLS CHERRY CROP\nApples in the Patoase Have Probably\nKsca|K\'d Injury.\nCOLFAX, May 1. —The two heavy\nfrosts Saturday and Sunday nights\nhave nearly wiped out the cherry\ncrop in this county and destroyed\nthousands of dollars" worth of fruits\ngenerally. Sweet cherries are entir\nely destroyed in quite every section\nas they were sufficiently far advanced\nto receive the injury. Peaches and\npears have been hurt very materially\nboth in this section and on the Snake\nriver. Apples are not hurt much as\nthey were hardly advanced enough to\nbe nipped by the frost.\nThe greatest damage was done\nalong the Snake river where the fruit\nwas farther advanced, fruit growers\nin that section losing a larger por\ntion of their crop of all kinds of\nfruit. It is estimated that quite 80\nper cent of the crop has been de\nstroyed. George Reudy, proprietor\nof the Colfax nursery, stated that\nwhile cherries were all gone and\npeaches and pears hurt badly, the\npeach and pear crop had promised so\nunusually large that there would be\na fair crop of fruit, although not in\nabundance. "We could lose half of\nthe crop of peaces and pears and\nstill have a fair crop." said Mr.\nReady.\nEXPECT A LARGE FRUIT CROP\nindications Are That High Prices\nWill Also Rule.\nNORTH YAKIMA. April \'30.—\nFruit men -.vho have followed close\nly the crop conditions for this year,\nhave arrived at the conclusion that\nconditions were never more favor\naide for a bumper crop, and it is a\nsafe guess that, prices will reach a\nhigher mark than than they ever\nhave known. Commission men and\nexpert buyers have sent inquiries re\ngarding the crop prospects here, be\ning especially interested because fruit\nwill be scarce in other places as\nfrosts have damaged the trees and\nin some placed have caused absolute\nEssentials for Eating\nNecessaries to Meet Your Needs for the\nManna Mush and Cured Meats for your\nmorning meals.\nCanned Fruits, Peaches, Pears, Plums and\nother things for pastries, pies and\npuddings.\nTable Furniture, Dishes for your dinner\nand other meals.\nPretty Pieces for Particular People.

Green.\nCaptain Green i 3 at present a spec\nial officer of the department of the\ninterior, with headquarters at Wash\nington, D. C, and has been up in\nthe Okanogan country running down\nthe illicit Whisky sellers. His latest\ncatch is Joe McDonald, an account of\nwhose many \' mistakes" appeared in\nthe World last week. McDonald la\nnow at liberty, but under $1000\nbond. Thers are 122 charges against\nhim for the illegal sale of liquor,\nand one of rape. _His henchman, sur\nnamed Gordon, got wind of the pres\nence of the government officer and\nflew the coop. McDonald will be\ntaken to Spokane to face the federal\ncourt there.\nThe career of Green reads like a\nchapter from the life of "The Yellow\nHaired Chief." He has been succes\nsively U. S. marshal, sheriff of var\nious borderland countries, a member\nof Roosevelt\'s Rough Riders, later a\ncaptain in the Philippine constabu\nlary, from which service he resigned\nin June last. The president desired\nthat Captain Green should remain in\nthe Phillipine service, and a major\'s\ncommission was his, had he cared to\nstay. But as he said to a World re\nporter yesterday, "the country is no\nlonger the proper place for a white\nman to get results in—the Filipinos\nhave too much to say about the gov\nernment."\nCaptain Green had the reputation\nin Manila of being one of the most\nefficient officers in the constabulary\nservice. hi 3 name being a terror to\nladrones and evil-doers throughout\nthe islands. He probably had more\nto do with the running down of the\nladrones and the stamping out of\ncarabao stealing than any other of\nficial of the Philippine army.\nThe captain will leave today for\nSpokane.\nWHEAT IS GONE AT PI\'LLMAX\nOnly About 15 Per Cent Remains in\nthe Warehouses.\nPULLMAN, May I.—Little wheat\nis going from Pullman now became\nthere is little to ship.

Cars are being supplied at\nmost places as fast as needed."\nSays Best People are Hying Off.\nNEW YORK, May l.—i n a letter\nto the editor of the Review of Re\nviews, President Roosevelt takes ex\nception to a certain article on "The\nDoctor and the Public School," pub\nlished in the April number of the\nperiodical, and takes occasion to re\nnew his expressions on the subject\nof race suicide.\n"This writer states clearly," saja\nthe president, "that it is an erron\neous idea to assume that the average\nfamily should have a larger number\nof healthy children than the present\nbirth rate showed. The vital s\'tatis-1\ntics of a state like Massachusetts\nshov. that the average native Amer\nican family of native American de\nscent has fallen below the death rate.\nThis, of course, means race suicide,\nand it ought to be understood that\nafter a while, when there are no\nchildren to go to school, the question\'\nof their health in school would not\neven become academic."\nContinuing Mr. Roosevelt says:\n"The greatest problem of civiliza\ntion is to be found in the fact that\nwell to do families tend to die out.\nThe results in consequence-—a ten\ndency to the elimination, instead of\nthe survival of the fittest, and the\nmoral attitude which helps on this\nmoral tendency—are, of course,\nstrengthened when it is apologized\nfor and praised in a magazine like\nyours.\n"Our people could still exist under\nall kinds of iniquities, under debased\ncurrency, under official corruption,\nunder the rule of the socialistic pro\nletiarat, or under a wealthy oligar\nchy.\n"All these things would be bad for\nus, but the country would still exist.\nBut it could not continue to exist if\nit paid heed to the expressed or im\nplied teachings of such articles as\n, these."\n•Imply Cenldnl tuspew lC*sl\n1 Scottish folk are proverbially canny\nand prudent In money matters, and\nthe following shows that the younger\ngeneration is no exception to the rule.\nA teacher in a lowland school was\ntaking mental arithmetic with a class\nof boys.

It\nwas only the theft of a pocket hand\nkerchief from a pocket, but the circiiiu\nstances of the deed explain the vehe\nmence of this denunciation. Four then\nwere on their trial for assaulting a man\nin his house at Ponders End, putting\nhim in fear and stealing from him, and\none of them relieved the tedium of the\ntrial, which lasted eight hours, by pick\ning the pocket of one of the turnkeys\nas he stood in the dock. An official had\nthe presence of mind to order the res\ntoration of the handkerchief, and the\nprisoner had enough presence of mind\nto obey "with the most careless indif\nference," but the court, we read, "were\nhorror struck."
