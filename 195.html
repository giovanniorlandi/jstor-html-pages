LITTLE.\nEntirely unconscious of its wrong\'\ndoing and utterly without any inten\ntioa or desire to rouse the -sleeping\nHons of the Grand Forks Herald\n«ditorial sanctum, the Tribune under\ntoow the other day to advance the\ntheory that a man in public life might\nle opposed to the theory of direct\nprimary elections, without being utter\xad\nly corrupt and unworthy,, of public\nconfidence. In support of its theory\nthe Tribune reproduced an article\nfrom the Times at New York, and in\nreproducing it expressly disclaimed\nany intention of so doing for the pur\xad\npose of arguing the merits of the\nprimary law pro or con, but solely to\nshow that some big public men and\n-writers of editorials were opposed to\nthe direct primary law as a taatter of.\npolitical and economic expediency,\nand were bold enough to advance\ntheir convictions. It is unfortunate\n"that the editor of the Times did not\nobtain permission from the editor of\nthe Herald to advance his primary\nviews, for in that case we might not\nSiave been in the embarrassing and\nunpleasant position of having awak\xad\nened the wrath of the Herald. We do\nnot believe the editor of the Herald\nTead the article in the Tribune as\nnaosely aa tbe article deserved. And\n•certainly #e do not believe the editor\n-of Che Herald answered the article in\nthe same spirit it was originally\n-written.

The work that has been\ndone by the Fargo a^d Cass county\npeople this season is typical of the\npossibilities of North Dakota thrift\nand energy. They have obtained a\nsplendid tract of land at a convenient\ndistance from the city, available by\ncomfortable and rapid transportation.\nThis has been enclosed, cement walks\nand good roads laid out, handsom^\nexhibit buildings erected, and the\nnucleus formed of what ought to be\nand undoubtedly will be a splendid\nfair. Fargo men have given liberally\nof their time and money to the fair\nproject. The city of Fargo is reaping\nthe benefits of that expenditure, and\nincidentally the people of the state\nare given the opportunity for a whole\xad\nsome and enjoyablq outing at small\nexpense. One effect of the fair will\nno doubt be to keep large numbers\nwho formerly went to the Minnesota\nstate fair at home, and funds that\nwent into circulation in other chan\xad\nnels will stay in our own. This is a\nselfish view possibly, hut it is a\npractical one, and will appeal especial\xad\nly to those interested in business in\xad\nstitutions in the Red river valley\ncities. The Grand Forks people, we\nmay say, did -not have so much to do\nto make the state appropriation avail\xad\nable, as they had already the founda\xad\ntions laid for a good fair, in the way\nof buildings and improvements. They\nwere unfortunate last year in the\nmatter of weather, but we have no\ndoubt the future will see fairs there\nas good as any can, be made in the\nstate. Bpth cities are to be con\xad\ngratulated upon the opportunity that\nhas been given them to build up\nwholesome, profitable and attractive\nexhibitions.\nMi not Wants a Normal School.\nJ. M. Devine, former state superin\xad\ntendent of public instruction, says it\nis evident to the entire, state that\nthere was a crying need for an educa\xad\ntional institution at Minot and more\nparticularly speaking a normal. When\nthe constitutional committee fixed\nlocations of the different state institu\xad\ntions, this section of the state was not\nconsidered for the reason that it was\na vast territory with little or no\npopulation, ©ut the rapid growth of\nthis section during the past eight\nhas today made Minot a city of. six\nthousand people as against two thous\xad\nand six years ago. Ward\' county has\na population of thirty-six thousand as\nagainst six thousand eight, years ago\nwith an assessed valuation ?f twelve\nmillion as against two Milton six\nyears ago. What is trie of Ward\ncounty is true of the "counties of Wil\xad\nliam, McLean, iftcHenry, Bottineau,\nPierce, Towner and Rollette, all of\nwhich are directly tributary to Minot\nin the supporting and upbuilding of an\neducational Institution at this point.\nEducators universally concede and ali\nthoughtful citizens admit that we ar-i\nentitled to and should have a normal\nschool. With the great wealth and\nits rapidly increasing population a\nnormal school at this point wsuld in\nmy judgment bave as la-ge an at\xad\ntendance in five seven years opera\xad\ntion as has Valley City or Mayvilte\nafter fifteen years of successful oper\xad\nation. We have not only the. popula\xad\ntion and tax paying capacity but the\nschool would .have the great\'advan\xad\ntage of being the only institution of\nlearning in the state within the area\nof one hundred and fifty miles and\nfor the ease and ma&y other good rea\xad\nsons this section and preferably Minot\nbecause of its excellent railroad ad\xad\nvantages is entitled to and should\nhave a good normal school.\nDo your eyes\nCook\'s Optical ad.\n1\ntrouble pon?

Clark would plead guilty to charges\nof maintaining a fence around govern\xad\nment land. The two first named de\xad\nfendants were the principal stock\xad\nholders in the Little Missouri Horse\nCo., one of the largest stock raising\nconcerns in the United States until re\xad\ncently when the holdings of the com\xad\npany in North Dakota were sold.\nClark was foreman^ of the big ranch\non the Little Missouri river.\nThe three defendants were in court\nthis afternoon and through their at\xad\ntorney, Seth Newman, asked to\nchange theii- plea from not guilty to\nguilty.\nAssistant United States Attorney\nTownsend asked the court to dismiss\nall of the counts of the indictments\nagainst Bond and A. ,R. Huidekoper\nand also to dismiss the first and sec\xad\nond counts of the indictments against\nthe other three defendants, accepting\nonly their plea of guilty to the second\ncount of the indictments.\nMr. Newman engaged in a lengthy\nplea to the court for mercy- He said\nthat the defendants had immediately\ncommenced the work of tearing down\nof fences as soon as .they had been\nnotified to do so. The law providing\na penalty .for the erection of fences\non government land had been a dead\nletter for about ten years, Mr. New\xad\nman claimed, and his Clients had\nacted in good f^ith throughout the\nproceeding.\nIngenious Plea Made by Rascal.\n"Nobody is worried nowadays by.\nthe fact that the twelfth month of the\nyear is called the tenth—December,"\nsays a writer, "and no doubt even\nthe ancient Romans soon got used to\nthe anomaly when the new year \\jas\nshifted back from March to January,\nthough the old names qf the months\nwere retained.

In so doing the tiger was do\xad\ning its best to live up to the name of\nits kind. Tigers are so called because\nof the swiftness of their movement,\nespecially in springing upon prey,\n"tiglfri" being the\' old Persian word\nfor an arrow. Hence it comes about,\nthat the beast and ,the River Tigris\nhave the same name. There is no\ndirect connection between them, but\'\nin both cases their swiftness was the\ncharacteristic that impressed the early\nnan?e givers. The tiger\'s name is,,\nthus, perhaps, nearly as superior in\nnobility to the hyena\'s, as the one\nbeast is to the other, since "hyena"\nis merely Greek for "sow."\nAmbassadorial Etiquette.\nAmbassadors and ministers are ae»\ncorded precedence among themselves\naccording to the dates of their ap\xad\npointments, and their wives enjoy the\nsame privileges, in Rome a curious\nbit of etiquette obtains, in a "black"\nhouse the plenipotentiary accredited\nto the Qnirinal takes precedence of\nhis colleague at the Vatican, while\nin a "white" house the convene role\nIs observed.\nPrice of Milk in\nIn Paris the average price of &OM\nmilk is 23.8 cents a g&Iloik\n(First publication July 2V1906.)\nNotiee ef Hearing Application for\nDruggist\'s Pefmlti\n9tet« of North Dakota, County of Borteisfe,\n«& vOtUity \'LOQft*\njssssifete\nBISMARCK DAILY TRIBUNE* FRIDAY, JULY 27, 180©. w" Y\'„\ni.\nThe defendants, with A.

The first\nparty rounded up proved an alibi as\nno gun was found in their possession,\nthey simply giving the dog a little\npractice. While interviewing- the fifst\nparty gun sihots were heard in an\xad\nother direction and the warden pro\xad\nceeded to investigate. Over on Apple\ncreek he found .a party that was doing\nfracture the law with gun\nand dog, and the only reason he has\nnot a good fine to pay today lies in the\nfact that he could not hit the birds,\nupon which he had used up consider\xad\nable amunition ineffectually.
