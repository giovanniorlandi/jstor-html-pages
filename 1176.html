Ackerman is the Director of the Unconventional Weapons and\nTechnology Division at the National Consortium for the Study of\nTerrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). Prior to taking up his\ncurrent position, he was Research and Special Projects Director at\nSTART and before that the Director of the Weapons of Mass Destruction\nTerrorism Research Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies\nin Monterey, California. His research encompasses various areas relating\nto terrorism and counterterrorism, including terrorist threat assessment,\nradicalization, terrorist technologies and motivations for using chemical,\nbiological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons, and the modeling\nand simulation of terrorist behavior. He is the co-editor of Jihadists and\nWeapons of Mass Destruction (CRC Press, 2009), author of several\narticles on CBRN terrorism and has testified on terrorist motivations for\nusing nuclear weapons before the Senate Committee on Homeland\nSecurity. He completed his PhD in War Studies at King’s College London,\ndealing with the impact of emerging technologies on terrorist decisions\nrelating to weapons adoption.\nAbstract\nThe case studies undertaken in this special issue demonstrate\nunequivocally that, despite being forced to operate clandestinely and\nfacing the pressures of security forces seeking to hunt them down and\nneutralize them, at least a subset of violent non-state actors (VNSAs) are\ncapable of some genuinely impressive feats of engineering. At the same\ntime, success in such endeavours is not guaranteed and VNSAs will\nundoubtedly face a number of obstacles along the way. A comparative\nanalysis of the cases also reveals new insights about the factors\ninfluencing the decision to pursue complex engineering efforts, the\nimplementation of such decisions and the determinants of the ultimate\noutcome. These result in a set of hypotheses and indicators that, if\nconfirmed by future research, can contribute to both operational and\nstrategic intelligence assessments. Overall, the current study enriches\nour understanding of how and why VNSAs might engage in complex\nengineering efforts.\nDisclaimer\nThis article is available in Journal of Strategic Security:\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\n', 'Editor’s Note: This article forms part of a series of related case studies\ncollected in this Special Issue and should be viewed in the context of the\nbroader phenomenon of complex engineering by violent non-state actors.\nReaders are advised to consult the introductory and concluding papers\nfor a full explanation and comparative analysis of the cases.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by Sandia National Laboratories, Contract\n#1525332.

Yet, those who study violent non-state \nactors (VNSAs) more broadly, where the relatively straightforward \napplication of firearms, explosives and telecommunications are the \noverwhelming norm, can sometimes be misled into viewing these exploits as \nthe limit of VNSA capabilities.1  The preceding cases, however, have \ndemonstrated unequivocally that, despite being forced to operate \nclandestinely and facing the pressures of security forces seeking to hunt them \ndown and neutralize them, at least a subset of VNSAs have shown themselves \nto be capable of some genuinely impressive feats of engineering.  If these \ncases (the basic features of which are shown in Table 1) do nothing more than \ngive pause to those who too easily dismiss the potential threats posed by nonstate\nactors, they will have served a useful purpose. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Case Study Features \n PIRA \nAum \nShinrikyo FARC Zetas HAMAS \nAQ Khan \nNetwork2 \nComplex \nEngineering \nEffort \nSophisticated \nmortar systems \nChemical \nweapons; \nNuclear \nWeapons "Narco-subs" \nEncrypted \ncountrywide \nradio network \nOperational \ntunnel network \ninto Israel \nIllicit transfer of \nnuclear \nequipment and \ndesigns \nOverall \nOutcome Successful \nChemical: \nLimited success; \nNuclear: \nUnsuccessful Successful Successful Successful Successful \nType of \nOrganization Terrorist Terrorist / Cult \nTerrorist / \nTCO TCO Terrorist \nSmuggling \nnetwork \nGeneral Motive Ethnonationalist \nApocalypticMillenarian\nMarxist; \nFinancial gain Financial gain \nEthnonationalist; \nIslamist Financial gain \nRegional \nContext Western Europe Asia South America \nNorth \nAmerica Middle East International \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 For a complete discussion of the literature and theory surrounding complex engineering \nefforts by VNSAs, as well as the methodology and case selection process, see the \nIntroduction to this Special Issue. \n2 As described in the Introduction to the Special Issue, the AQ Khan network is presented \nnot as a case of complex engineering itself, but rather as an example of how an illicit \nnetwork might facilitate and support such an effort. It is therefore analyzed separately \nfrom the other cases for most purposes in this analysis and is differentiated from the \nother cases in the table with italics. \nAckerman: Comparative Analysis of VNSA Complex Engineering Efforts\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '120 \n \n \nDecision \nStill, the case studies have a lot more to offer in terms of providing insights \ninto the characteristics that are associated with VNSA complex engineering \nefforts.  Beginning with the decision to engage in complex engineering efforts, \nTable 2 below summarizes several aspects of the decision making process \nacross the case studies (the A.Q. Khan nuclear case will be discussed \nseparately).  For the general context in which decisions were made, in all \ncases the actual decision to engage in the complex engineering effort was \nmade by the central decision-making body in each organization.  Irrespective \nof who actually carried out the effort, in all cases the organization’s senior \nleadership had to at least give the go-ahead.  While there might have been \nconsultation with and input from lower level organizational personnel, it \nappears that since the effort under consideration represented a major new \ninitiative, requiring the investment of substantial organizational resources \nand often entailing sizeable risks, it was not left up to functional entities or \nfield commanders to make the key decisions, which occurred in a top-down \nfashion.  \n \nAnother common feature across all the cases was the high risk tolerance \ndisplayed by the organization’s decision makers more generally.  While the \nsmall number of cases and the absence of negative examples make it difficult \nto state that a high tolerance for risk is either necessary or sufficient for \ndeciding to engage in a complex engineering effort, it is striking that none of \nthe VNSAs studied could be characterized as being operationally conservative \nin any way.  Moreover, a perceived urgency to act did not seem to color most \nof the VNSA decision making.  While leaders may have perceived a clear \nstrategic need to do something different, in no case (with the exception of \nAum Shinrikyo, which had a prophesized deadline only a few years hence) \nwas there evidence that the leaders felt the need to make the decision quickly \nor rashly.  Embarking on a complex engineering effort was therefore mostly a \nreasoned decision, one that likely estimated the various costs and benefits \ninvolved. \n \nTurning to the key question of what factors contributed to the decisions \nthemselves, while the specifics vary considerably across the VNSAs studied, \nthere are several commonalities in the overall motivational formula.  This can \nbe discerned by viewing the interacting effects of different levels of motivation \nthat underlie the decision to engage in a complex engineering effort.  Across \nthe cases, (1) the basic motivational disposition of the VNSA itself exerts the \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 9, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.9.1.1511\n', "121 \n \nbroadest stimulus by determining more proximate strategic goals.  It is these \ngoals that (2) in turn produce the tactical requirements that (3), often in \nreaction to external circumstances, then provide the impetus for the \norganization to make a change in its operations.  Lastly, it appears that (4) a \nvariety of contingent and contextual factors influence the selection of a \nparticular solution to the operational problem that involves a complex \ntechnology, as well as the decision to engage in an internal engineering effort \nto obtain this technology.  For example, in the case of the PIRA, their \nfundamentally ethnonationalist conflict against the British pushed them to \nattack police and military targets, which in turn sparked a search to tactically \novercome the high-walled fortifications surrounding these targets, while \nseveral contextual factors, including particular tactical requirements in an \nurban environment and a distrust of externally sourced armaments, led them \nto pursue their own mortar systems.  Similarly, the FARC, which had evolved \nto pursue financial gain, was driven to make operational changes by increased \ninterdiction rates by counternarcotics authorities, while the advantages in \nterms of carrying capacity and detection avoidance, together with a high \nreturn on investment, prompted the decision to pursue a submersible \ndevelopment program. \n \nTable 2: Decision Characteristics \n PIRA Aum Shinrikyo FARC Zetas HAMAS \nDecision \nMakers Army Council \nShoko Asahara \n(leader) \nGeneral Secretariat \nand Joint Western \nCommand \nHeriberto LazcanoLazcano\n(with \nAntonio CardenasGuillen,\nJorgeCostilla-\nSanchez) \nAl-Qassam Brigades \n(esp.

It can thus be \nhypothesized that complex engineering efforts by VNSAs are much less likely \nto arise spontaneously where an organization perceives itself to be enjoying \ntactical and strategic success in terms of reaching its immediate goals. \n \nA second hypothesis suggested by the cases is that a complex engineering task \nis more likely to be undertaken in the absence of any simple alternatives that \nwill solve the operational problem that the VNSA is confronted with.  This \naccords with the general theory that VNSAs tend to be conservative and \nimitative in their operations and will in most instances pursue the path of \nleast resistance.  A corollary to the hypothesis is that a complex technology \nwill usually be sought only if there exists no simple technology that will suffice \nand that a VNSA will usually decide to engage in an internal engineering \neffort to acquire the technology only if no external suppliers are readily \navailable or if external supply poses too many security risks. \n \nIt also appears that, even though the VNSAs studied were willing to take large \nrisks, they did not undertake complex engineering projects on the off chance \nthat they might be successful.  In all the cases studied, leaders seem to have \nmade the final decision to embark on such an effort only if they had at least \nsome degree of confidence in their groups’ ability to pull it off.  Whether the \nsource of this confidence lay in having copious resources, professional cadre, \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 9, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.9.1.1511\n", '123 \n \nprior experience in similar technical areas, or even a delusional faith in \nprophecy (as in the case of Aum Shinrikyo), the decision was made based on \nsome expectation of success, at least in the long run.  Another hypothesis is \ntherefore that a positive decision to pursue a complex engineering effort will \nbe far more likely if factors can be identified that might boost leaders’ \nconfidence in their efforts’ ultimate success. \n \nIn at least two of the cases (the PIRA and Los Zetas), the desire for prestige \nlikely played some role in the decision.  Here, the very act of the VNSA \nundertaking a complex, risky and resource-intensive effort might have been \nperceived as valuable in terms of messaging to opponents, rivals or followers \nthat the organization was one to be reckoned with.  While likely neither to be \na necessary nor sufficient criterion, it can thus be hypothesized that where an \norganization is especially concerned with its image as a sophisticated, \ninnovative actor, a desire for prestige can be a powerful facilitating factor in \nthe decision to engage in a complex engineering effort. \n \nThe case studies support many of the broader findings and theories of how \nand when VNSAs decide to innovate, as outlined in the introductory article. \nSeveral of the drivers of innovation mentioned in the literature, such as \ncountermeasures by security forces and a greater desire for status, are \nreflected in the cases.  So is causal variation in the decision making, although \nthe cases of complex engineering efforts presented in this volume point \ntowards a more generalizable decision framework (as described above) than is \ndiscernible in the broader VNSA innovation context.  The importance placed \nin the literature on a willingness to take risks and organizational learning is \nalso echoed by the case studies.  Another factor is the facilitative effect of \ninternal champions, which is alluded to in several of the cases. However, \nbecause the champions in the cases tended to coincide with the senior \nleadership of the VNSAs, it is not possible to identify an independent effect of \ninternal or external champions.  \n \nFactors identified in the literature on VNSA innovation that were not \nsupported (but also not contradicted) by the majority of the case studies were: \nThe effects of demonstration of the technology by other VNSAs3 on the \ndecision to pursue a complex engineering efforts (since most of the complex \nengineering efforts had never been undertaken by VNSAs previously), \nwhether a self-sustaining momentum developed that would have continued to \ndrive the efforts even in the absence of the initial stimuli, and the extent to \n                                                          \n3 The Hamas case did reflect this factor, however, in that its ally Hezbollah as well as its \nrival Fatah had previously constructed tunnels. \nAckerman: Comparative Analysis of VNSA Complex Engineering Efforts\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '124 \n \nwhich the possession of institutionalized R&D organs or safe havens \ncontributed towards the decision to engage in these efforts.  However, related \nto this last area, possessing high levels of resources seem to be particularly \nimportant in the context of the decision to proceed with a complex \nengineering effort, which would not necessarily be the case with broader \nVNSA innovation.  Given the selection of case studies of only positive \ndecisions to pursue, several findings in the literature, such as the \ndisincentives for innovating in the presence of internal discord or high \npressures from security forces, could not be explored in the current study. \n \nImplementation  \nThe case studies make perhaps their greatest contribution with respect to \nexploring the implementation of complex engineering efforts by VNSAs, given \nthat there is scant existing literature on this topic.  Table 3 summarizes the \nimplementation aspects examined across the five relevant cases.  First, from \nthe time frames over which implementation occurred, it is immediately \napparent that complex engineering tasks are not generally implemented very \nquickly, at least not to the extent that they return results that can be regarded \nas unqualified successes.  It appears to take a minimum of several years’ \nworth of effort to yield even modestly successful outcomes (as in the cases of \nAum’s chemical weapons), and can take upwards of a decade or more to \nachieve the fully-realized outcomes initially envisaged by group leaders (as in \nthe cases of PIRA mortars and FARC “narco-submarines”).  It can thus be \nhypothesized that complex engineering efforts by VNSAs take a considerable \namount of time, at least relative to the highly dynamic environment within \nwhich most VNSAs operate.  If confirmed, this would suggest that law \nenforcement, intelligence and military agencies have a sizeable window in \nwhich to detect and interdict such efforts. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Characteristics \n PIRA Aum Shinrikyo FARC Zetas HAMAS \nTime Frame 1970-1990s \nChemical: 1990-1995; \nNuclear: 1992-1993 1992-present 2006-2012 \nCirca 2007present\nLocation \nVarious in Republic \nof Ireland; also N. \nIreland and maybe \nEngland \nVarious facilities in \nJapan and farm in \nAustralia \nSanquianga and \nBuenaventura \nRegions, Colombia \nMajority of Mexico\'s \n31 states Gaza \nPrimary \nImplementer  \nEngineering \nDepartment \n"Ministry of \nConstruction"; \n"Ministry of Science \nand Technology" \nJoint Western \nCommand \nTechnical team (~20 \npeople) led by Jose \nEstrada; assisted by \nlocal plaza bosses \nAl-Qassam \nBrigades \nEngineering Unit \n(direction by M. \nDeif, A. al-Jaabari) \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 9, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.9.1.1511\n', '125 \n \nTechnical \nExpertise \nNeeded \nExplosives; \nmachining; \npropulsion / \naerodynamics \nChemical \nengineering; nuclear \nphysics; metallurgy; \nmechanical \nengineering \nTechnical design and \nconstruction (e.g., \nengineers, welders, \nelectricians, fiberglass \ninstallers); experts in \nnavigation \nequipment; \nexperienced seafarers \nTelecommunications \nengineers; hardware \n/ software expertise. \nGeology; structural \nengineering; \nelectrical \nengineering; \nmining \nKey Source of \nExpertise \nProfessionallytrained\nmembers \n(incl. engineers); \nmilitary manuals & \npersonnel; trial and \nerror \nRecruitment of \nprofessionallytrained\nmembers; \noutside consultants; \nthe Internet \nProfessionallytrained\nmembers; \nColombian navy \npersonnel; \nsubcontractors \n(Russian, Sri Lankan, \nPakistani engineers); \ncoerced naval \nengineers \nInitially, hiring \ntechnicians; later, \nkidnapping and \ncoercion \nPrior experience \nwith smuggling \ntunnels; assistance \nfrom Hezbollah \n(perhaps indirectly \nIran and N.

The PIRA enjoyed some degree of \nsanctuary in the Republic of Ireland while developing their mortars; Aum \nShinrikyo was protected by the Japanese government’s reticence to scrutinize \nreligious movements and the isolation of their Australian property; FARC \nconducted its “narco-sub” operations in inaccessible jungle areas; the Zetas \nenjoyed near impunity in many regions of Mexico where corruption had \ninfested civil society; and Hamas controlled the territory of Gaza when it built \nits operational tunnels.  The existence of VNSA safe havens can therefore be \nhypothesized to complicate counterterrorist or counter-criminal attempts to \ndetect or interrupt complex engineering efforts. \n \nThird, in terms of who within the VNSA is tasked with implementing the \ncomplex engineering effort, in almost all the cases the responsibility was \ngiven to a specialist technical or logistical organ in the group, whether this \nwas institutionalized (as in the cases of the PIRA, Hamas, and Aum \nShinrikyo) on a broader scale in the organizational structure or more ad-hoc \n(as in the cases of FARC and the Zetas).  Complex engineering efforts by their \nvery nature are highly technical and will almost always represent a radical \ndeparture from standard operating procedures within the VNSA. This accords \nwith the more general theory that dedicated, separate R&D organs can bolster \nthe chances of success when VNSAs choose to innovate; indeed, in the context \nof complex engineering efforts, this might be more of a requirement than a \nfacilitating factor.  The existence of a well-resourced, specialized entity \nendorsed by the leadership might thus be a necessary precondition for any \nserious attempt to realize a complex engineering effort, which in turn might \nprovide specific, moderately diagnostic indicators4 for intelligence analysts \nobserving the VNSA. \n \nFourth, with respect to the types of expertise needed, these vary considerably \nacross cases, although—as is to be expected—various types of engineering \n(including electrical, aeronautical, chemical, structural and mechanical) \nfeature prominently.  Much of the required expertise appears to have come \nfrom professionals who had been previously trained, whether this could be \nfound among existing members (as in the PIRA and Hamas cases), members \nspecially recruited for their expertise (as in the case of Aum), hired \nconsultants (in the case of FARC), external actors lending assistance (Hamas), \nor even coerced technicians (in the cases of FARC and Los Zetas).  While there \nwas also some internal development of expertise, for example by sending \n                                                          \n4 Heuer, Richards, Psychology of Intelligence Analysis (Langley, VA: Center for the Study \nof Intelligence, 1999). \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 9, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.9.1.1511\n', '127 \n \nmembers for professional training (PIRA) or a process of trial and error \n(PIRA and Hamas), it can be hypothesized that in most cases VNSA complex \nengineering efforts will involve some degree of externally-sourced \nprofessional expertise, at least if the organization is keen on keeping the \nlength of the development cycle to a minimum.  Thus, contrary to the \nliterature on general VNSA innovation, professional technical expertise, \nbeyond a generally proficient and stable membership, might be necessary.  If \nconfirmed, this can provide opportunities for detection of complex \nengineering activities by VNSAs. \n \nConversely, when it comes to the source of needed materials, in almost every \ncase at least a significant portion of these materials were purchased from \ncommercial suppliers, albeit often under the pretext of legitimate commerce, \ne.g., through front companies.  While there was some assistance from state \nsponsors (in the case of Hamas and the PIRA), and some acquisition from \nillicit networks, in none of the cases studied was there outright theft to obtain \nmaterials, which would have provided a useful indicator of activity.  If the \nreliance on legitimate purchase for materials applies more broadly than the \ncases studied, this potentially makes it more difficult for intelligence and law \nenforcement agencies to detect most complex engineering efforts through \nmaterial acquisition activities, unlike the case with, say small arms, explosives \nand nuclear materials acquisition. \n \nFifth, although many of the cases involved at least some collaboration with \noutside entities, except for the professional expertise provided from outside \n(which generally occurred on an individual basis), it appears as if \ncollaboration with outside actors, such as states or other VNSAs was not \nentirely necessary.  For example, Libya provided the PIRA with high \nexplosives, which certainly assisted in their production of mortars, but even \nbefore this, the PIRA had succeeded in creating operational mortars using \nhome-made explosives.  Similarly, while Hezbollah may have assisted Hamas \nin designing attack tunnels, Hamas had decades of internal Palestinian \nexperience with smuggling tunnels to draw upon. \n \nSixth, organizational concern with the safety of general VNSA members \ninvolved in complex engineering efforts is variable across the cases, although \nit is interesting to note that the only group which unequivocally paid careful \nattention to its members’ safety was Aum Shinrikyo, which was also arguably \nthe least successful of the cases studied in terms of its complex engineering \nendeavors.  This does not necessarily contradict the assertion in the literature \nthat key members with technical skills and experience will be protected, since \nAckerman: Comparative Analysis of VNSA Complex Engineering Efforts\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '128 \n \nthe cases mostly do not reveal how the safety of these key implementers was \nregarded within the organization.  In the related matter of how much \noperational security VNSAs employed during their complex engineering \nefforts, this was generally moderate to high, with the key determinant \napparently the degree to which the organization believed itself to be \nvulnerable to security forces. \n \nThe last aspect of implementation and a particularly important one involves \nthe obstacles experienced during the process and how the VNSAs responded \nto these obstacles.  It is immediately apparent from the cases that, as \nexpected, almost any endeavor undertaken by a VNSA that qualifies as a \ncomplex engineering effort is almost certain to face at least some obstacles \nalong the path from conception to execution.  One assumption, which spans \nthe relevant literature and which applies to all of the obstacles discussed \nbelow, is that as the complex engineering task in question becomes more \ncomplex and more technically demanding, the potential obstacles become \ngreater in number and severity.  While the case studies do not confirm this \nassumption as such, they certainly do not contradict it either.  In every case \nstudied, the VNSA under consideration experienced at least one (and often \nmore) serious impediments to success.  These ranged from defects in design \n(e.g., PIRA and FARC), lack of access to materials (Aum Shinrikyo), operating \nin difficult terrain (Los Zetas) and having to avoid government forces during \nimplementation (Los Zetas and Hamas).  \n  \nHowever, in the case of all but Aum, a common thread amongst the various \nresponses was perseverance in the effort despite setbacks.  It was only in the \nAum Shinrikyo case of nuclear weapons where the group abandoned their \nplans and switched back to chemical and biological agents; it might not be \ncoincidental that this is the organization that ultimately enjoyed possibly the \nleast success from a purely engineering point of view.  Besides perseverance, \nthe VNSAs employed a variety of means to overcome obstacles, including \nmaking iterative technical improvements, bringing on additional expertise, \nreplacing infrastructure lost to security force activity and increasing their \nresource investment in the project.  Each of these, however, can be seen as an \nadaptation to an internal or external impediment.  It can be hypothesized that \nVNSAs that possess sufficient fortitude to persevere in the face of setbacks \nand that have the capacity to devote additional resources (including \npersonnel, equipment, and funding) to a complex engineering effort are far \nmore likely to succeed in the face of almost inevitable obstacles.  Conversely, \nthose VNSAs who lack suitable depth in motivation and capability are \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 9, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.9.1.1511\n', "129 \n \nhypothesized to be far less likely to succeed in complex engineering efforts in \ngeneral. \n \nOutcome \nMost of the cases studied (with the notable exception of Aum’s nuclear \nprogram) represent successful attempts by VNSAs to engage in complex \nengineering efforts.  Table 4 encapsulates the major factors identified in each \ncase study as being primarily responsible for the outcome of the complex \nengineering effort.  The VNSAs under examination pursued very different \ntypes of technology as part of these efforts.  Yet, while each case had some \nunique determinants of success, from the cases as a whole we can identify \nfour key elements that in general might be expected to increase the \nprobability of a VNSA being successful in a complex engineering endeavor.  \n \nTable 4: Outcome Summary \nCase Outcome Main Determinants of Outcome \nPIRA Success \n(a) Organizational and individual expertise and access to materials \n(b) Safe haven \n(c) Culture of learning \nAum \nChemical: \nLimited \nSuccess \nNuclear: \nFailure \nChemical: \n(a) High resources \n(b) Safe haven (protected as a religion under Japanese law) \n(c) Technical personnel, but insufficiently skilled \nNuclear: \n(a) Self-imposed ideological deadline \n(b) Lack of physics knowledge and practical expertise in nuclear engineering \nFARC Success \n(a) Financial and human resources \n(b) Safe havens (inaccessible areas) \n(c) Culture of learning / long-term strategy \n(d) Influence over populace \nZetas Success \n(a) High resources \n(b) Ruthless efficiency and esprit d'corps \nHAMAS Success \n(a) High resource investment \n(b) Prior experience with smuggling tunnels \n(c) Culture of Learning \nAQ \nKhan \nNetwork \nSuccess (in \nterms of \nsmuggling) \n(a) Unfamiliar environment for intelligence agencies \n(b) Concealment activities \n(c) Venal suppliers \n(d) Lack of political will to prevent activities \n  \n1. Substantial investment of resources. The very nature of complex \nengineering efforts means that they will invariably require significant \namounts of both human and financial resources to undertake.  This is \nespecially true when one considers the inevitable obstacles that will \nAckerman: Comparative Analysis of VNSA Complex Engineering Efforts\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n", '130 \n \narise during any attempt to operationalize a new, complex process.  \nNot only must a VNSA possess (or be able to acquire) high levels of \nresources, but it must be both willing and able to devote these \nresources to the complex engineering effort, most likely maintaining \nthese levels over an extended period of time as the development \nprocess matures.  In at least four of the five case studies of complex \nengineering efforts (Aum Shinrikyo, Los Zetas, FARC and Hamas), the \nVNSAs possessed large amounts of fungible resources that could be \napplied to the complex engineering effort without detracting \nsignificantly from other activities, and even in the case of the PIRA, the \nleadership was willing to devote a non-negligible proportion of its \nresources to mortar development for more than two decades.  A \ncorollary to this hypothesis is that a long-term commitment is needed \nfor most complex engineering efforts to succeed. \n \n2. Technical Expertise. As in the more general case of innovation by \nVNSAs, the transfer or development of the required technical \nknowledge and practical skills played a central role in determining \noutcomes in the case studies.5  Whether by bringing in outside \nexpertise (e.g., FARC and Los Zetas) or developing their own through \ntrial-and-error (e.g., PIRA and Hamas), it is hypothesized that a VNSA \ncomplex engineering effort is unlikely to succeed without acquiring the \nappropriate amount of technical expertise for the effort at hand. In \nmost respects, there is no place for amateurs in complex engineering \nefforts. The Aum Shinrikyo case exemplifies this—in the domain in \nwhich the group possessed expertise, namely chemical engineering, it \nwas more successful, while in those areas where this expertise was \nlacking, namely nuclear physics and nuclear engineering, it  failed \nmiserably, despite the devotion of substantial resources and efforts in \nthat direction. \n \n                                                          \n5 A more nuanced approach to this topic is to focus separately on the different knowledge \ncomponents embodied in technical skills. These can be separated into what Michael \nKenney characterizes as general technical knowledge (techne) and contextual, \nexperiential knowledge (mētis), both of which are argued to be crucial to successful \nadoption of new technology. Kenney, Michael, “ ‘Dumb’ Yet Deadly: Local Knowledge and \nPoor Tradecraft Among Islamist Militants in Britain and Spain,” Studies in Conflict & \nTerrorism, 33:10 (2010), 911-932; Ackerman, Gary, “‘More Bang for the Buck’: \nExamining the Determinants of Terrorist Adoption of New Weapons Technologies” (PhD \nDissertation: King’s College London, 2014), 23, available at: \nhttps://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/32901277/2014_Ackerman_Gary_0715371_ethes\nis.pdf, 87-90. \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 9, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.9.1.1511\n', '131 \n \n3. Safe haven. As noted above, one feature shared by nearly all of the \nVNSAs studied was that they were able to pursue their complex \nengineering efforts over extended periods in circumstances where \ndirect engagement with security forces was unlikely.  They were able to \nengage in R&D in a relatively secure environment with relatively little \noperational risk.  A plausible hypothesis is thus that some measure of \nsafe haven is necessary for most VNSAs’ complex engineering efforts \nto succeed. \n \n4. Culture of learning. The last factor that seems to have played an \nimportant role in more than one case is the ability of the VNSA to \nidentify the source of deficiencies in its efforts, and then to persevere \nuntil a solution to the problem is found and executed.  This ties into \nthe investment of resources in that it implies commitment to the effort \nover an extended period of time.  \n \nIt is at this stage that reference to the A.Q. Khan case study can be made. The \nrelevance of this case lies in how it demonstrates that VNSAs need not depend \non state actors for even the most highly technical and difficult to obtain \ncomponents and expertise required for complex engineering efforts.  Driven \nby the opportunity for financial gain, A.Q. Khan stood at the head of an illicit \nnon-state actor network that persisted for over fifteen years and spanned \nmore than twenty countries around the world.  Although the Khan network \nwas provided with some cover by the Pakistani state, even when this \ndiminished, the network endured despite extensive nonproliferation efforts \nby the major powers following the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. \nTwo of the main reasons for the continued success of A.Q. Khan in providing \nnuclear equipment and expertise to a variety of customers (fortunately, none \nof them non-state actors) were the willingness of legitimate suppliers to look \nthe other way in exchange for increased profit and the ability of the network \nto move further up the supply chain to obtain more basic components that \nwere not controlled.  Nor was the Khan case an anomaly.  While it illustrates \nthat an illicit trading network could exist for even the most dangerous and \nsophisticated technology, there are many other instances of non-state actor \nnetworks supplying dangerous materials for profit, including the longstanding\narms smuggling networks of Viktor Bout and Monzer Al-Kasser and \nthe biological agent exploits of Wouter Basson, the former head of the South \nAfrican chemical and biological weapons programs, who also “went rogue” \nwhile enjoying the tacit protection of the state. \n \n \nAckerman: Comparative Analysis of VNSA Complex Engineering Efforts\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '132 \n \nFuture Research Directions and Policy Implications \nThe case studies have provided several insights into the decision, \nimplementation and outcomes of complex engineering efforts as undertaken \nby VNSAs. The observation that we are able to discern several common \nelements—from similar decisional underpinnings to factors that facilitate \nimplementation—across very different cases reflecting different time periods, \ngeographic regions and motivations, indicates that VNSA complex \nengineering efforts might be shaped by similar dynamics and subject to a \nparticular set of constraints.  However, as noted in the introductory article to \nthe special issue, the case studies represent only an exploratory investigation \ninto the phenomenon.  Although several hypotheses are suggested by the \ncases, these hypotheses require confirmation through more robust testing \nprocedures before they can be fully utilized to shape policy and practice. In \naddition to identifying and investigating additional cases of successful \ncomplex engineering efforts by VNSAs, it will be necessary to explore multiple \ninstances of failed attempts to engage in complex engineering.  This would \nenable the use of several qualitative and quantitative methods, such as casecontrol\nsampling and Qualitative Comparative Analysis,6 to determine the \nextent to which any of the hypothesized factors are necessary, sufficient or \nmerely strongly correlated with particular outcomes and indicators. \n \nWith respect to how this study can help to inform counterterrorist and law \nenforcement policy and practice, if the above hypotheses are indeed \nconfirmed by further investigation, many of them can be directly employed as \nobservable indicators to show when a VNSA has the intent to engage in, or is \nalready engaging in, complex engineering efforts.  This would be useful for \nintelligence analysis at the operational level.  For example, among the \npotential indicators that might prove most useful in detecting and interdicting \nVNSA complex engineering efforts are: (1) Changes in a VNSA’s strategic or \ntactical environment for which no simple operational adaptation will \ncompensate and where there are no readily available suppliers of the \nnecessary technology; or (2) Attempts by a VNSA to recruit, hire, coerce or \notherwise acquire technical expertise.  \n \nThe factors that point to an increased (or decreased) likelihood of a VNSA \nengaging in, and especially succeeding in, complex engineering efforts can \n                                                          \n6 For example, see Stolley, Paul and James Schlesselman, Case-control studies: Design, \nConduct, Analysis (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982) and Rihoux, Benoȋt, and \nCharles Ragin (eds.), Configurational Comparative Methods: Qualitative Comparative \nAnalysis (QCA) and Related Techniques (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc., \n2009). \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 9, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss1/10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.9.1.1511\n', '133 \n \nalso inform strategic threat assessments, both of particular VNSAs and of \nclasses of VNSAs such as transnational criminal organizations.  Therefore, \nfurther research might confirm that the VNSAs that are most likely to pursue \nand succeed in complex engineering efforts are those which: (1) have a \npenchant for taking risks; (2) are willing and able to devote substantial \nresources to the effort for an extended period of time; (3) can conduct R&D \nthrough a specialized organ in a location of relative security; (4) tend to \npersevere in the face of setbacks; and (5) either already have, or can relatively \neasily acquire, the necessary expertise. \n \nOverall, the current study has enriched our understanding of how and why \nVNSAs might engage in complex engineering efforts.  It has shown that such \nendeavors will undoubtedly face a number of obstacles and requirements and \nthus hardly constitute faits accompli.  Nonetheless, we must not \nunderestimate the ability of VNSAs to accomplish remarkable feats of \nengineering in pursuit of their tactical and strategic goals.  When \norganizational conditions are right, almost any technical task, even the most \ncomplex, become feasible for VNSAs. \n \nAckerman: Comparative Analysis of VNSA Complex Engineering Efforts\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n']</pre>
