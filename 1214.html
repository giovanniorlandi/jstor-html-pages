DISHONOR\nWounded Call Vainly For Assistance\nand Dead Bodies In Decompos\ning Condition Lie Unbur\nled ou ttattlefleld\nChefoo Sept 20 According to\nLieutenant Prince Radzlvll of the Rus\nsian army who reached here Sunday\nfrom Port Arthur bearing dispatches\nfrom Lieutenant General Stoessel to\nGeneral Kuropatkln the temper of the\nbelligerents at Port Arthur has reached\nan absolutely merciless stage Prince\nRadzlvel served with the British In\nthe Boer war and he says that until\nhe became aware of the state of affairs\nat Port Arthur he had no Jdea that war\ncould be so horrible It was set forth\nIn these dispatches some weeks ago\nthat serious suspicions were enter\ntained by both belligerents that the\nother was misusing the Red Cross flag\nThese suspicions have been Increased\nby the commission of various acts by\nthe soldiers of both armies until now\neven flags < if truce or surrender are\nnot respected by either side\nPrince Radzlvll declares that the\nmen of both armies are absolutely\nvenomous in their antagonism Lieu\ntenant General Stoessel has addressed\nhis garrison saying the present mood\nof the Japanese Indicates clearly the\nnecessity of resisting the mto the last\ndrop of Russian blood because If the\nJapanese soldiers entered the fortress\nIt would be Impossible for their officers\nto control them and prevent a massa\ncre For this reason Lieutenant Gen\neral Stoessel Is making no objection to\ncivilians leaving Port Arthur When\nthe 300 women who are In Port Ar\nthur engaged in hospital work were\nadvised to leave they replied that they\nwould rather face th eposslbillty of\nmassacre than desert their posts In\nconsequence of the fact that flags of\ntruce are Ignored numbers of Jap\nanese dead woh have been lying on\nthe slopes of the hills of the northeast\ndefenses for weeks past are still un\nburied and the stench In Port Arthur\nfrom decomposing bodies when the\nwind Is in the right direction Is al\nmost unbearable The Russian sol\ndiers who are In some cases posted\nonly fifty paces from heaps of decay\ning dead have constantly to wear up\non their noses handkerchiefs soaked\nIn camphor or otherwise they would\nbe unable to remain at their posts\nIn the course of the assaults which\ntook place In tbe four last days of Au\ngust two companies of Japanese sol\nidlers according to Prince Radzlvll\nfound themselves at the mercy of the\nlusftlans ond ralsed the white flag\nTothls however the Russians paid no\nattention and continued to fire vollles\nrapidly Into the helpless ranks I of the\nenemy In the meantime Japanese\ntroops in the rear of the company that\nhad raised the white flag saw what\ntheir comrades had done and expressed\ntheir disapproval of the surrender by\nfiring Into their rear As a result of\nthis fire from friend and foe 600 men\nwere annihilated The dead fell\namong the decomposing bodies of pre\nvious assaults For days afterward\nthe wounded men In this area raised\nfluttering handkerchiefs In their\npleas for help but the Russians were\nafraid to venture out to give aid\nWithin a week the enemy had made Its\nlast prayer for help and the shambles\nwas a quiet but ghastly field of hor\nror Among the heaps of dead the\nprince saw two soldiers one a Rus\nsian and the other n Japanese lying\nlocked in death embrace The teeth of\nthe Japanese were sunk in the Rus\nsians throat while the Russian had\nforced two of his Angers Into the eye\nsocket of his antagonist\nThe prince cited this as merely an\nincident denoting the ferocity of the\nconflict at Port Arthur\nContinuing his Interview with the\ncorrespondent the prince said The\nstories In circulation concerning the\nshortage of ammunition and provisions\nat Port Arthur are not true There\nIs an abundance of ammunition for\nboth large and small arms and plenty\nof preserved food Thb use of Chinese\nshells was merely a saving measure\nI left Stoessel In the best of spirits\nHe is encouraged by the heroic exam\npi set by the wounded men of whom\n5000 out of the original 8000 in the\nhospital have returned to the front\nThere has been no fighting since\nSept 1 with the exception of artillery\nand outpost exchanges\nThe Japanese shells have done\ngreat damage to the hospital and other\nbuilding In Port Arthur but the losses\nof life from these bombardments have\nbeen very slight\nOn Sept 14 the bodies of 2C0O Jap\nanese soldiers were discovered between\nFort No 2 and Fort No 3 The stench\nfrom the decomposed bodies attracted\ninvestigation The Russian authorities\nadmit that they arc not able to ex\nplain what engagement resulted In this\nslaughter\nPrince Radzlvll gives another ver\nsion from hearsay concerning the two\ncompanies of Japanese troops that\nsurrendered According to this ver\nsion a Japanese battery fired first on\nthe two companies when the white\nflag was raised whereupon the two\ncompanies turned and charged the bat\ntery\nVigorous Shelling\nLondon Sept 20 It it asserted In\na dispatch from Toklo to the ExpucPi\nthat the Japanese arp vigorously shell\ning the Russian positions at Mukden\npreparatory to a

too easy\nMiss Mischief I simply bad to give\nthat good soul a hint of warning\nTraitor Estelle retorted pre\ntending to hiss the word high tragedy\nfashion yet ending with a dimpling\nlaugh The laugh went far to redeem\nher face so far that it set more than\none beholder speculating that old Ma\njor Gilberts stranger granddaughter\nwould not really be so bad looking If\nshe knew how to wear her clothes\nand do her heavy hair this despite\nber wretched complexion for she had\na beautiful straight nose and good\nteeth to say nothing of her handsome\neyes Her neck must be bad else\nwhy was she swathed up to the ears\nHer sleeves also quite swallowed ber\ngloved bands but her feet were as\nmuch in evidence as they well could\nbe incased in boots at least three\niizes large\nWith everjjtedy else in party bibs\nand tuckersfsuch garmenting made\nher conspicuous all the more that the\ngown she wore was grass green with\na bright pink stock and much dead\nwhite braiding Spangles and

odious bond\nBronson did not answer A stir about\nthe door drew all eyes Adonis other\nwiae George Gilbert Estelles cousin\ncoheir and fiance entered with Adela\nEvans clinging ostentatiously to his\narm She had such a habit of clinging\nthere that the sports of Grossbope bad\nbeen ready to give odds this laBt half\nyear that she would ere this have writ\nten herself Mrs Gcorgo Gilbert but for\nGrandfather Gilberts absurd wllL\nThis Instrument decreed flatly which\never of his two descendants refused to\nmarry the other thereby forfeited all\nclaim to the big Gilbert fortune\nThe boy and girl had been brought\ntip half a continent apart Estelle had\ncome to Grasshope for the first time\nleu than a week before But tales of\nner had been rife there the last threo\nyears how willful she was also how\nsharp of speech and of temper As to\nher looks there bad been several opin\nions Reed Bronson might have spoken\nauthoritatively but he chose to be si\nlent He had met Estelle two sum\nmers running at the seashore and with\neach meeting he became more indiffer\nent to Grossbope belles and their\ncharms He bad known first of all\nthat Estelle was coming to visit her\nmothers cousins the Warrens Mrs\nEvans thought ber bold for it She did\nnot need to marry George before she\nwaa twentytwo and might therefore\nwell have left It to blm to do the seek\ning\nWhat George thought about It no\nbody knew He smiled down at Adela\nas they crossed to Estelle When he\ngot a good look nt ber bis smile be\ncame for a breaths space quizzical\nbut it was kind and wholly cordial as\nlio took both ber bands saying I\nknow you all right young lndy If you\nwould never let me have your pic\nture\nSomebodys been telling Estelle\nsaid solemnly although her eyes danc\ned They had never rented upon a finer\nfellow than George He had all the\nto admit George carried things ofl\nvery well Indeed And after supper\nwhen the dancing began Bronson the\nluckless went Into complete eclipse\nHe bated dancing as well be might\nseeing that lie danced 60 badly George\nGilbert contrariwise might bnve been\nwing footed so lightly did be move in\nsuch perfect time and tune Music In\ndeed was In the Gilbert blood Estelle\ndanced if anything better When they\nwaltzed together other couples stopped\nto see Indeed they kept on and on\nnnd on until they had the whole crowd\nstaring as alone tbey whirled and\nwheeled over the waxed floor of tho\nhall Stop Estellel Bronson Implored In\na loud whisper as the couple whirled\npast blm George smiled broadly Es\ntelle dismayed put a band up to her\nface As she took It away two pimplt\nand half a dozen freckles came with It\nGeorge saw them andl quickly guided\nber out of the light\nGo wash your face he commanded\nImperatively And the next time you\nwant to go masquerading let me help\nyou make up I know heaps of better\ndlsflgurement Besides grease paint\nis fearfully unreliable when one loves\ndancing as we do\nI forgot I ought not to havo\ndanced Estelle said contritely then\nwith a swift change of mood But you\nwouldnt have known If I had been a\nlittle wiser\nIndeed I would I went COO miles\nlast summer Just to see you George\nhalf whispered So I understood tho\nminute I looked nt you tonight You\nwanted to disgust me to make me\nlose a wife and a fortune I dont\nblame you Women have to fight In\njustice with their own weapons Still\nI wish you hadnt done It You cm\nsay So to me this minute If you like\nand get back more than all the money\nyou lose by saying It tomorrow\nI see You want to Invest In Dres\nden china Estelle Interrupted auda\nciously So of course I dont want to\nsay It not now at least\nThat must be quite as you please\nGeorge said smiling over

said sorrowful\nly Fate Is playing me tricks putting\nall the trumps In Addas hands\nNot quite You forget I shall make\nyour excuses and take you and Mrs\nWarren home George said Dont\nkeep me waiting either Im all Impa\ntience to see your real self\nGrasshope bad no end of sensations\nthrough the next bIx weeks The first\ncame when George Gilbert broke the\nprearranged engagement the next\nwhen It was seen that he was disput\ning with Hoed Bronson for first place\nIn bis cousins regard and the third\nand greatcst was to find the strange\nGilbert girl truly a beauty with no\nend of fine feathers and a most en\nchanting way of wearing them Adela\nEvans looked faded and insignificant\nbeside her although away from her\nshe was easily the prettiest girl in\ntown But Adela was spiritless these\ndays She no longer had hopes of\ncatching George He was eagerly\ndesperately In earnest about Estelle\nalthough she had given him back as\nin duty bound rather more than half\nthe money Heed Bronson was no less\nearnest so between tbcm they kept\npublic Interest at fercr heat\nEstelle was nobly Impartial At first\nshe had thought herself really In love\nwith Bronson That was what had Im\npelled her to tho masquerading But\nsomehow Georges grave hurt face\nhad made her very much ashamed\nalthough she would have died rath\ner than admit love at first sight Then\nbis freeing ber and settling down to\ncourt her anew appealed to something\nin her of like fiber Altogether she\nwas hard put to it to decide\nThe strain of it all bore hardest on\nBronson His temper never sweet\nbecame abrupt and uncertain He was\nbarely civil to other women George\ncontrariwise continued to be a but\nterfly among the social flowers\nUpon one of those spring dayB that\nseem made for love the three rode\ntogether through blossomy lanes\nBronson rode but clumsily so when\npresently bis mount bolted It was nil\nlie could do to keep his scat George\na horseman born was after the run\naway In a minute caught blm nnd\nchecked him so sharply that the mad\ncreature reared kicked savagely and\nat last fell backward taking the other\nhorse with It In a struggling plunging\nheap That anybody came out of It\nalive was little short of a miracle But\nthere was nothing worse for cither\nthan a broken arm As Bronson stood\nruefully nursing it he said looking\nstraight in Estelles eyes You

violations of the Terrell law by\npublic service corporations\nSection 137 of the Terrell elec\ntion law provides that any corr\nporation or officer thereof who\ndirectly or indirectly furnishes\nloans or gives away money or\nthing of value to aid those who\nmanage what has been known in\nTexas as political headquarters\nof candidates or to any campaign\nmanager or to any particular can\ndidate or person to promote the\nsuccess of such candidate for pub\nlic office shall be guilty of a mis\ndemeanor and if a corporation\nif the act was done with the ap\nproval or connivance of its presi\ndent financial agent or treasurer\nforfeits its charter It has been\ncharged on reputable authority\nthat certain railroad corporations\ncontributed materially to the late\ncampaign for democratic nomina\ntions in this state in plain and\ndefiant violation of this law It\nputs the booster at the polls out of\nbusiness but according to this\ncharge the far more potent rail\nroad booster with a pocketful of\npasses is not disturbed by the\nlaw The most important ends of\nthe Terrell law will fail of attain\nment if the railroads are enabled\nby the use of passes to hold the\nbalance of power in contests for\npartynominations There is suf\nficient ground upon which to base\nan investigation of this subject by\nthe next legislature and it should\nbe made If it should be found\nto be true that any railroad used\nprohibited methods to influence\nthe choice of any candidate be\nfore the primaries the law should\nbe rigidly tracked and proceed\nings promptly
