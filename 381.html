The independence of the\nprofession carries with it the right\nfreely to challenge, criticise and con\ndemn all matters and things under re\nview and in evidence. But with this\nprivilege goes the corresponding obli\ngation of constant courtesy and res\npect toward the tribunal in which the\nproceedings are pending. And the\nfact that the tribunal is an inferior\none, and its rulings not final and with\nout appeal, does not diminish in the\nslightest degree this .obligation of;\ncourtesy and respect.. A justice of\nll,;e ne.ore nom tne most mi\nlin matter is being litigated is en-\ntitled to receive from every attorney\nin the case corteous and respectful\ntreatment. A failure to extend this\ncourtesy and respectful treatment is\nfailure of duty; and it may be sr\ngross a dereliction as to warrant the\nexercise of the power to punish for\ncontempt.\nIt is so that in every case where a\njudge decides for one party,, he de\ncides against another; and oftimes\nboth parties are before hand enually\nconfident and sanguine. The\' disap\npointment, therefore, is great, and it\nis not in human nature that there\n3hould be other than bitter feeling\nwhich ofteji reaches to the judge a\nthe cause of the supposed wrong. A\njudge, therefore, ought to be patient\nand tolerate everytning that apners\nbut the momentary outbreak of dis\nappointment. A second thought will\ngenerally make a party ashamed o\nsuch an outbreak.
