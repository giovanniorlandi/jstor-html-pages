Sent. 20. What\nthe county authorities claim to be a\ngigantic scheme to systematically rob\nthe gold dredges operating in the vl\nclnlty of Folsom has been unearthed\nthrough the arrest of Frank Cole, E\nCordell, W. Wells and Charles Lom\nbardi on charges of grand larceny\nThey are now being held in the coun\nty jail. It is claimed that evidence\nis at hand to prove that they have\nbeen taking amalgam of great value\nfrom the dredgers owned by Wil\nffi E. Gerber, a Sacramento banker,\naS!i R. G. Hanford, operating under\nthe name of the Folsom development\ncompany.\nInformation from the mint in San\nFrancisco is what led to the arrest of\nthe men. It was reported . to the\ndredger people that large amounts of\namalgam was being disposed of there\nthat resembled that taken from the\ndredges. The fact that the man dis\nposing of it did not follow the usual\nbusiness method of shipping the\ngold by express and receiving his\ncoin in the same way, but instead\ncalled at the mint personally with\nthe metal is what aroused the sus\npicions of the authorities. The mat\nter has been in the hands of County\nDetective Lamphrey for several days\nand it was on the evidence he gath\nered that the district attorney ad\nvised the sheriff to make the arrests.\nIt was ascertained that Cole disposed\nof the amalgam at the mint.\nCole and Cordell had been work\ning on one of the dredges for many\nmonths. About three months ago\nthey purchased a saloon in Folsom.\nIn an effort to throw off suspicion\nit is contended they borrowed a por\ntion of the money with which to com\nplete the transaction. This they ad\nmitted when questioned by the au\nthorities and also acknowledged they\nhad considerable amalgam in their\npossession at the time. They did not\nattempt to conduct the saloon them\nselves but installed Lombardi as boss\nand barkeeper and continued their\nnmnlovment on the dredges.\nThe authorities declare that the\nmen had easy access to the plates on\nthe dredges as they came from the\nsluices and that the matter of scrap\ning off a little gold at a time was\neasy. The theory is that Lombardi,\nthe barkeeper was the go between be\n. twen others who was operating with\nCordell and Cole. Wells ia declared\nto be one of these. Cole admits hav\ning disposed of a large amount of the\nprecious metal at the mint In San\nirnnrlnro. bnt claims that it came\nfrom a mine owned by hie mother at\nTnwi Hill. It is the belief that a\nlarge amount of amalgam is cached\n- 4l.nHltlAtf\nnear Folsom, dui ine miuuw\nhave been unable to find it.

Must\n"a killed a cow tew be crowln\' about\nIt that much! Pm-k.\nAn important strike was made last\nnight on the Booth-Alexander-Byrne\nlease on blocks 9 and 10 of the Mas\ncot claim No. 1 on Balloon hill which\nproves the existence of large bodies\nof good milling ore on the east Blope\nof Balloon hill and which undoubted\nly will soon place this lease among\nthe prominent producers of the camp.\nThis lease Is owned and being oper\nated by the Rawhide Mascot Balloon\nHill Mining company and embraces\nfour acres of the choicest ground in\nthe camp, covering the central por\ntion of Balloon hill on the eastern\nand western slopes and lying between\nthe famous Kearns Xo. 2 and Jordan\nleases.\nAfter months of persistent work\nthe Rawhide Mascot Balloon Hill\nMining company has been rewarded\nby encountering what promises to de\nvelop into one of the largest bodies\nof milling ore yet discovered on Bal\nloon hill. Liberal quantities of free\ngold show in every \'panning made\nfrom the new vein which was an\ncovered last night in a crosscut being\ndriven southerly from the main tun\nnel on the east slope of the moun\ntain. The vein has been penetrated\nabout four feet and the entire break\nof the vein apparently carries values\nof from $20 to $30 per ton.\nThe crosscut was started for the\npurpose of reaching the Immense\nrhyolte dyke which outcrops prom\ninently on the surface about thirty,\nfeet south from the breast of the\ntunnel. The third round of shots in\nthe crosscut broke into a body of\nquartz, all of which carries good\nvalues, but the full extent of the vein\nhas not been determined. It was be\nlieved by the management of the\nproperty that pay ore would be\nfound at the contact of the rhyolite\ndyke, but this unexpected discovery\nat some distance before that point\nwas reached indicates the existence of\na heavily mineralized zone extending\nalmost from the tunnel to the dyke\nitself. It is the opinion of Mr\nCharles E. Watson, consulting engi\nneer for the company, that the values\nwill materially Increase as the dyke\nis approached and high grade ore is\nexpected at the contact.\nThis rhyolite dyke cuts the strati\nfication of the mountain in such a\nmanner that a strong faultng is caus\ned, and the history of development in\nRawhide shows that the richest and\nlargest ore bodies occur at these con\ntacts or faults.\nThe crosscut will be pushed ahead\nby three shifts and the ore bodies\nrapidly opened for production. Pres\nent development gives 115. feet of\nstoping ground above the level of the\ntunnel and this will be largely in\ncreased by driving to the crest of\nthe hill. The surface indications\nalong the crest of Balloon hill show\na very pronounced orthoclase dyke\nforming the core of the hill, which\ncarries on the surface sufficient val\nues to\' make it a profitable product\nunder the favorable milling charges\nwhich will soon be available for\nRawhide ores. The values shown on\nsurface will undoubtedly increase\nwith depth.\nThe orthoclase dyke is seamed\nwith small stringers of quartz which\nshow considerable free gold at sur\nface, and it Is the opinion of eminent\ngeologists who have visited the dis\ntrict that these quartz stringers will\nunite at depth and form good streaks\nof high grade In addition to the val\nues contained In large bodies of mill\ning ore.\nDevelopments on the east side of\nthe mountain consist of the tunnel\n160 feet In length, the crosscut is In\nabout six feet, and an incline shaft\nfrom the surface sixty-five feet in\ndepth, which is connected with the\ntunnel at the breast, affording splen\ndid ventilation. This shaft is within\nfifty feet of the shaft on the famous\nJordan lease, from which shipments\nof ore running $1500 have been\nmade. High grade ore was encount\nered cn the surface where this in\ncline shaft was sunk and assays of\n$525, $650 and $980 were secured.\nThe general break of the ore in the\nshaft shows values ranging from $75\nto $130 per ton.\nOn the west slope of Balloon hill\nand adjoining the Kearns No. 2 lease\nis a shaft forty feet with a crosscut\nof fifteen feet in which good milling\nvalues have been developed. This\npart of the lease covers the same con\ntact in which the rich ore on the\nKearns No. 2 was found, and con\ntinued development here should ex\npose as good ore bodies as have been\nuncovered in its famous neighbor.\nThe company is now formulating\nplans for installing a power hoist on\nboth of the shafts for the purpose ot\nsinking to greater depth. The recent\nstrike on the east slope of the hill has\nencouraged the management to even\nmore aggressive development of this\nvery promising proposition than has\nheretofore been followed, and this\nlease Is undoubtedly destined soon to\nbecome one of the most important\nproducers in Rawhide.\nSubscribe for The Bonar7\nWILKES WAREHOUSE COMPANY\nPhone Rock Spring\'s\n322 COAL\nPROMPT DELIVERY\nCOAL\nTHE TONOPAH BANKING CORPORATION\nCapital and Surplus Fully Paid $340,000\nA general bauhing business transacted.

TAFT\nJAMES S. SHERMAN\nEDITORIAL COMMENT.\nBUSINESS RETURNS TO NORMAL COND1TON.\nFor the first time since the panic New York clearings were in excess\nof the corresponding week of the previous year, and as there has been no\nunusual volume of stock exchange transactions, the gain doubtless indi\ncates steadily improving business conditions, says the San Francisco\nChronicle. Boston, also, shows a slight increase over last year. Thirty\nout of ninety-one cities having clearing house reports show increases over\nthe corresponding week of last year, and the large regular decreases have\nevidently come to a permanent stop. Trade in all lines of staple merchan\ndise is normal, but the abnormal expenditures for luxuries have not been\nresumed. They are not likely to be for some time. Industries are stead\nily increasing their output and unemployment is decreasing throughout\nthe country. Railroads and other established public service corporations\nare making extensions and betterments and there is a beginning of effort\nto float new enterprises. Money is easier than in any recent year at this\nseason.\nTaking the country as a whole, the strong financial condition of the\nfarmers is producing the expected effect in restoring confidence. It has\nbeen demonstrated that no class of the community has endured the finin-\nuraln of the past months st .M?ily as farmers, aud while Incomes are\nsmaller than they have been, there is a margin to the good which justifies\nmerchants In laying in normal, but not extravagant stocks. The distribu\ntion of business directly traceable to the political campaign is decidedly\nless than usual in presidential campaigns, although there are. doubtless\nmany who are deferring investments which would be made now were no\npolitical campaigns in progress. Upon the whole the last fortnight has\nshown more progress than any previous two weeks of the year toward\nthe good time coming which everybody expects to come.\nCol. H. B. Maxson, who has been visiting various places throughout\nthe state, has returned to Reno and in a letter to a friend says that the\nstate is surely going \'Republican.

Pan-\nAmerican commerce, ,so rar as re\nlates to the west coast of South\nAmerica, is described in a report of\nSpecial Agent Charles M. Pepper to\nthe department of commerce and la\nbor, which is published by the bureau\n"of manufacturers. The report esti\nmates that between now and the com\npletion of the Panama canal 9 60,1\n000,000 will have been spent in har\nbor improvements on the west coast\nin order that the ports may procure\nthe fullest advantages of the canal\nThe greatest harbor improvements\nare those of Valparaiso, which will\ninvolve an ultimate expenditure of\n$20,000,000.\nThe total foreign commerce of\nEcuador. Per, Chile and Bolivia is\nplaced at $250,000,000 to $260,000,\n000. Of this commerce the United\nStates has about $50,000,000, the\nbalance being slightly against it.\nThere is, however, a marked increase\nof both exports and imports.\nThe natural conditions do not\nfavor the establishment of industries\non a large scale; so the west coast\ncountries will always be buyers of\nmanufactured articles. The largest\nmarket Is for railway material and\nmining machinery, but there is also\na growing trade in electrical appar\nattis apd In farm tools. The market\nfor textiles is largely controlled by\nGreat Britain. Flour, packing house\nproducts, canned goods and other\nprovisions are supplied by the United\nStates. Most of the railway construc\ntion now going on is due to the in\nvestment of capital from the United\nStates.\nHeavy investments have also been\nmade by capitalists from the United\nStates in mines and smelters, one In\nvestment in Peru amounting to $20,-\n000,000. Capital is also going into\nthe Bolivian tin mines.\nIf Tonopah selected all the county nomines ou the Democratic ticket\nand there were twelve more positions to give out, how many inhabitants\nwould there be left in the cotonty seat who are not running for office.\nAnswers should be sent to the puzzle .editor of The Rhyolite Bulletin.\nTRAILS FUGITIVE\nLOS ANGELES, Sept. 22.

With the\nmarket seemingly lacking all support\nthe bears were reckless in their buy;\ning to cover shorts toward the end of\nthe day, which was on an enormous\nscale. The violent recovery thus\ncaused left gains for the day in not\na few instances and materially alter\ned the whole appearance of earlier\nlosses. The closing tone was fever\nish and excited with the shorts still\ncovering heavily.
