DECEMBER 28. 1900., ONE CENT., THIRTEENTH YEAH., SAM FISHER AND, Tim DEAF AK TE, Sage of EUendale, Strikes, an Unresponsive Chord, in Washington, Everybody who knows anybody in, potllical circles In Sussex county, knows Samuel G. Fisher personally or, by reputation. The loquacious Sage, of EUendale is a Democrat of Demo, crats. a Kenney man of Kenney men,, and ne has one of these tongues-with, out-end-amen which is a delight to his, friends and a sourc e of constant and, profound annoyance to his enemies., When he was a minority member of, the Sussex county Levy Court years, ago he performed the function of a, human phonograph. The Democratic, leaders talked yards of Democratic ar, gument und objection into his ears and, then he went over to the Levy Court, room, opened the throttle at the root, of his tongue and reeled it oft to the, consternation of everybody and without, the least regard for the rules regulat, ing limited debate. In fact, this tall, and angular son of old Sussex is the, greatest monologue artist the lower, part of the State ever produced. \', Ho is not only a politician, but also, a statesman. Seated in the old bar, ber\'s chair In the railroad station In, EUendale he has settled definitely, more great public questions than any, statesman in Washington. While the, tariff, free silver, expansion, ship sub, sides, army reorganization, oleomar, garine and other great public questions, were agitating the mind of the public, at large, they did not worry EUendale, In the least, for Sam Fisher had said, bis say and they stood approved or, condemned according to ills concep, tion of their purposes and possible ef, fects., Senator Kenney got Sam a position, In the Senate folding room. He was a, revelation and an Inspiration to na, tional officialdom. He talked his way, Into the good graces of everybody, and, In a few weeks became better known, than Senator Kenney himself. Some, time ago he retired from his position,, and the folding room assumed the, quietude of a graveyard., But now he is bock in Washington,, Senator Kenney having obtained him a, position in the Postoffice Department., The first day tirât Sam spent in his, new place was devoted to makng the, acquaintance of the man who occu, pied the desk next to his. It has been, said that it takes two to make a con, versation. Sam doesn\'t believe that\'s, Anyway, for two hours and a-half, he talked away to his neighbor., "I noticed he didn\'t say nuthin\', back." said Sair. "but I kept right on,, and cum to find out he was a deef and, dumb man—I\'ll be durned et he, wasn\'t", .- ■>, The second day Sam devoted to as, certaining the political complexion of, the section. His canvass showed 256, Republicans, one Democrat and one, deaf-and-dumb man who didn\'t declare, himself., It Is a question how long Sam will, last with a deaf mute to talk to and, surrounded by 255 men and women, who are not in sympathy with the po, litical views of the voluble Sage of, EUendale., MIS.

Broad Street Station, Philadelphia., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2». 1900., OUR INFI UENCEABROAD, Advices from financial circles In, Berlin are to the effect that America Is, a growing factor In the economic situ, ation abroad, and that American In, fluence on the European markets Is be, ing felt more powerfully every year., The Frankfurter Zeitung, in Its yearly, financial review says:, in the first months ot (he year, says, the writer, when Gorman Industries, had not the remotest fear of reaction, It was the report from America regard, ing the Iron market and the fenr of, flooding the German market with, American manufactures that, te»1*l\'*Ä, our markets c, This was the c, miagitated our Boerses., •as^l\'en when there were, no important chamges in She business, situation in the United States. In short,, all the Incidents indicating, however,, remotely, that country\'s competiiloa, were discussed in tbelr bearings upon, our business situation; and they thus, became very important factors In de, termining the attitude of the German, Bowses ami the question of securities., Wall street quotations frequently be, came the standard for all other, changes The entrance of the United, State* into the ranks of creditor na, tions signifies a change lui the times., Ever since the war with Spain the, United Stales government has pursued, undeviatingly a world policy ot world, conquest. European States must fa, miliarize themselves with the thought, that the United States will have a very, weighty word in determining the new, political constellations, leading nations. American action In, undertaking the Nicaragua canal also, proves that the military and still more, the diplomatic participation of the, United States to the chief, shall bear fruit., ex, among the, troubles, This Is assuredly a striking compli, ment to President McKinley and his, policy of territorial and trade, elon. which the Democrats combatted, eo strenuously, hut unavalllngly., expan, John D, Rockefeller, Jr., son of the, president of the Standard Oil Company,, lias subscribed $230.000 for the found, ing of nn institution of loam lug for, poor girls and hoys. Here la another, cause for complaint by those political, demagogues who never give anything, to charitable or benevolent enterprises, themselves, but who Invariably damn, the rich and discredit all their gifts to, public charités., BRYAN SERVES NOTICE, William Jennings Bryan has served, notice upon those Democrats win», seeking to effect a reorganization of, their party that he docs not Intend to, permit himself and the issues of Free, Silver and anti-expansion to be elimi, nated by such a reorganization. In a, speech delivered by him at the annual, banquet of the Jeffersonian Club, Wednesday night, he said;, "The principles for which, ■ in, on, , we con, tended in the last campaign still live,, and we who believe in them must con, tinue to fight for them. An election, does not change principles; It only de, termine* what principles shall be for, the time being applied. Whether 1, 6 toll ever be a candidate for office, again Is a question which must be de, termined by events. No one can speak, with certainty of the future, for one\'s, destiny is not known Until his life\'s, work Is completed."\', We take it that Former President, Cleveland. Don M. Dickinson and the, other Democrats who are lending the, reform movement within the party will, conclude that, If the reform is to In, clude the keeping of Mr. Bryan and his, pet issues to the fore, they may, well reserve their energy for other and, more noble purposes., A cablegram from Pekin says the, peace commissioners have heard from, the emperor, who objects to the terms, imposed by the Powers In the Joint, note. Prince Cbing will confer with,, the emperor again before consulting, with the envoys as to the next move to, be made. It is not believed that the, Powers will modify their demands in, any material particular to meet the, objections of the emperor or the dow, ager empreee., Delaware shad fishermen should, operate with their New Jersey brethren, to i oator and protect their owm in, terests. In recent years there has, been a steady decline lo the price of, the fish, due in part to the largeness, of the catch and In part to the .rapacity, of the middlemen and dealers, who, have had the fishermen at their mercy., The Jereeymen have decided to take, the matter into their own hands by, providing themselves with facilities, for smoking and storing all shad for, the Winter market that cannot be sold, profitably to Summer. By limiting the, supply is Summer they, and not ;he, i, middle men, will regulate prices. The, life of the fisherman Is a hard and pre, carious one, and his season for work, la brief. He must realize from it, enough to support him and his family, during the remainder of the year, and, the Delaware fishermen will do well to, follow the example of the Jerseymen, and render themselves largely inde, pendent of both the warm weather and\', the middle-men., ROtR ACTIVITY WIDESPREAD, South African cables to I-ondon tell, of continued activity on the part at the, Boers in attacking British garrison«., Several of the attacks were repulsed., De Wet is scheming to break through, the British line« and move his forces, southward, evidently to lend strength, to the Cape Colony Invasion., Dispatches from Ixmdun this morn, ing say Lord Kitchener Is holding the, Invading Boers In Cajie Colony in, check, but that the burghers are dis, playing great activity over a wide, area., Three hundred students have toon, arrested in St. Petersburg for propa, gating Socialist doctrines, and once, more the Russian jxillcy of refusing, the man the right to think and talk, has given impetus to the reform move, ment already In existence In nil parts, of the vast empire, and destined in, time to break down the strongholds of, autocracy, intolerance and repression., Great railroad systems are quick to, feel the effect* of business prosperity,, for they carry, very largely, the gooils, that ore twilight and sold, and the fluc, tnntlnns ot general trade are apparent, on their books. That the directors of, the Heading Railway Company have an, abiding faith in the business future of, the country is manifested by the fact, that they have placed contracts for 2,, 000 steel freight cars, thirty passenger, coaches, forty-five loconThtlves, ten, steel sea-going barges and one sea-go, lag tugboat, at a total cost of more, than $2,600,000., LEGISLATION AFTER THE HOLIDAYS, The Senate Committee on Relations, with Cuba probably will meet imme, diately after the expiration of the holi, days for the purpose of further consid, ering the question of Irregularities un, der the China service, as direct«! by, the resolution of last sesnion., The House bill amending the War, Revenue law will be taken up by the, Senate Finance Committee immediate, ly after the reconvening of Congress., No hearings will bo granted by the, committee., tot no Delaware Republican be de, ceived by anything contained in the, Philadelphia Inquirer comcemlng the, political Situation her* in Delaware. It, Is a QUay-Addlcks organ, and Its ad, vice to the Republican members of the, Legislature Is for the benefit of Ad, dlcks, and not for the benefit of the, Republican party. It persistently mis, represents the motives of Delaware Re, publicans by statements and, cnees, and apparently obtains both its, editorial and news Inspiration from Ad, dicks headquarters., Infer, The work among the needy has been, a noteworthy feature of the Christmas, deeds of the churches and Sunday, Schools this year in this city. Many, baskets of provisions were distributed, on Christmas eve and the day follow, ing, but notwithstanding the large, number of families served, it hua beep, found that some were overlooked ami, the committees are making arrange, ments to have theee served, so that no, worthy ones shall be neglected., Now is the time for all good Repub, lican* to stand shoulder to shoulder in, the common cause of defeating Ad, dicks and sending two Republicans to, the United States Senate. Corruption, and disruption, to the guise of Addicks, Ism, have run riot in Delaware until It, now becomes necessary for the Repub, Ican party to stamp them out that our, State shall not become a veritable, lltlcal cesepool with Addieks as Ha, owner., po, Turkey, it is expected, not only will, pay the United States government tho, $90,000 Indemnity long overdue, but, couple with It a contract for a cruiser, to he built in Cramp\'s shipyard by, American workingmen. In other words,, the Indemnity will be included in the, contract price for the croiser, and tho, Cramps wll turn it over to the govern, ment. This will close aa^inpleasant, diplomatic incident growing out of the, religious fanaticism of the Turks in, their dealings with American mission, aries in the Ottoman Empire, and, at, the same time give Americans the bene, fit of the profits accruing from the, bundling of the warship., Former President Cleveland did not, vote for McKinley or Bryan. With, chancteristlc conservatism he voted, blank, and left an aggravated question, for other people to settle., NEWSPAPER OPINION, The Delaware Situation, From the PhUadelphia Evening Tele, graph (Rep.), A conference of the Democratic, members of the Delaware Legislature,, and the leaders of the party in the, State, has just been held at Dover, the, object thereof being the harmonizing, of all the elements of the party in the, proceedings of the approaching see, sion ; There is one prime object to be, attamed by the honest and self-re, spectlng Republicans and Democrats, of the Diamond State, and that Is the, utter defeat of the gasman\'s scheme to, obtain a seat in the Senate of the, I\'nlted Statee. To the attainment of, that object all other ends and alms, should bo subordinated by every true, Delawarean, whatever his political as, sociations or views on national issues, may be. That, we are bound to be, lieve, was the animating spirit of the, gentlemen who attended the Dover, conference yesterday: ami, happily, it, 1s the spirit which animates the true, Republicans of the State. There have, been, so far, no Indications of waver, ing on Hie part of the latter, and the, Democratic jiarty of the State should, uphold their hands In the fairest and, most patriotic means of saving Dela, ware from the deep disgrace of being, misrepresented in the National Senate, by a man of the Addieks stripe, or by, any man of either party who would, be a mere tool and henchman of the, discredited gasman., Delaware\'s Patriotic Democrats, From the Philadelphia North Araerl, __ can (Rep.), If Addieks, the Quay ot Delaware, is, eliminated from the political problem, of the State and thwarted ln lila ambl, tlon to become the boss, the credit ot, the achievement must be given to the, Democrats, who have done a thing un, precedented In politics., At a conference of the leaders of the, party with Democratic members of the, Legislature, which Is to choose two, United States senators, It was agreed, that In order to.save Delaware from, gasman the twenty-two, Democrat* should join the eleven, the golden, Regular Republicans in making the, organization of Hie Legislature Repub, lican, ami electing two Regular Re, publican senators,, the Democrats demand no, tlon. no division of patronage or spe, cial consideration. Th%y propose to, sink party feeling and political advan, tage and smash Addieks for the good, ot the State., The attitude of the Delaware Democ, racy is patriotic and almost heroic., Even in Its partisan aspect It Is, markably high and far-sighted. In the, long run the Democrats may hope to, derive some advantage from the de, struction of Addlcksism In certain, counties, but It Is not often that poli, ticians are broad enough to forego, present profit, however slight, for the, sake of deferred political dividends, that may accrue to their party and be, of no personal benefit to themselves., The Democrats of Delaware might, extort from the Republican« promises, of more than the normal party share, In the organization of the Legislature,, In return for their twenty-two vote«,, but the leaders with one exception,, and that an aspirant to senatorial, honors, reject the suggestion, and :M, vise unconditional and whole-hearted, support of the Regular Republicans, and the withdrawal of all Democratic, candidates from the field., For this servlo«, com v*-n sa, I, Such a, course mint strengthen the party that, Is broad and liberal enough to adopt, it. for it will gain for the party the, confidence and respect of citizens, whose first concern is for the good, name, at their State., AMONG THE FLAYERS, tor go audiences were entertained by, the Holden Comedy Company at the, Opera House yesterday afternoon and, last night.

In this, event the mills of the company are to, be removed to Now Casale, where the, company owns river front land, an, Ideal location for a great milling plant., Although the rumor has been denied, by members of the Lea Company, there, is some probability of the establish, ment of a morocco plant on the site,, inasmuch as Preston Lea, president of, the company. Is interested largely in, the Wilmington Leather Company, to, be organized shortly., Local manufacturers of morocco re, gard the site of the Lea mills as an, Ideal one for such a business as is ru, mored will be established here. The, excellent water service would save the, company upwards of $3,000 per year In, the cost of manufacturing its product, and the shipping facilities also would, add much to the profits of the enter, prise. Of course the mill would have, to be remodeled but there Is ground, for the erection of as large a plant as, there is devoted here to the finish, ing of bides., Should the manufacture of morocco, succeed the grinding of grains Jn this, mill it will mark the close of a mill, that has run unrivaled in the full tide, of its glory for the greater part of 150, years., SPECIAL JURY TO TRY, CLARK DAMAGE SUT, To try the case In the Superior Court, of Johm J.

The sum of fifty and twenty-five, being seventy-five by a rule of arith, metic. easily determines the age of the, bridegroom, while the simple multi, plication of twenty-five by two shows, that the bride has reached the iia.tr, oantury mark., Cupid evidently had no sinecure in, finding the vulnerable spots in the, hearts of this rustic twain. For twen, ty-five years the little love god kept, up a steady bombardment with his, love-poisoned arrows before he bagged, With unbroken regularity of a cen, tury Vernon called once a week at the, cottage home of the one he loved, and, not until they stood at the marriage, altar did Cupid dare take a day off., Many letters, too, were exchanged by, the loving pair during that long period, 4f billing and cooing. The first of, them are yellow and musty with age,, but while the lines grew dim with pass, ing time the vows they recorded were, ever youthful.., "One is just as old as he feels is an, axiom handed down to us by our fore, fathers." said Vernon yesterday. "I\'m, only 75 by record, and I\'m good for, twenty-five more. Even then I shan\'t, be as old as some men I know who, were children when I was a man.", And this bridegroom of 75 is tall, and stiaight and vigorous, while Ute, full crown of white hair seems to speak, more of physical and mental strength, than of age. He is one of nine bro, thers, seven of whom are living. The, these two hearts., total years they have lived is just 502., Boy\'s Hand Injured, Bpeclal to the Evening Journal., Newark, Dec. 28.—\'Walter Warren, a, young son of John N.
