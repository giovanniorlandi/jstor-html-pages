BYRNES PUBLISHES CORRESPONDENCE\nWITH HOUSTON.\nNo Cause For Panic.\nSecretary Referred to Treasury I#epartment\nNot Banks?In A?cord\nWrith Harang.\nJ Aiken, October i.?Congressman\nJames F. Byrnes, of Aiken, today 1\nmade public telegraphic correspondence\nwith Secretary of the Treasury\nb Houston, which shews that the secreI\ntary in his statement of last Monday \'\nW referred only 10 me atticuu-j ui mci\n\' treasury department and had no reference\nto the policy ot the federaj reserve\nbank system in discussing the\npaper of member banks. The secre- !\ntary advises Mr. "3yrjies that he *s .n ;\naccord with Governor Harding\'s defi- .\n} nition of "orderly marketing" as\nf meaning the marketing of the cotton :\ncrop gradually. The telegram of Mr.\nf Byrnes to Secretary Houston on Sen- ;\ntember 26 reads as follows: [\n"All trade reports\' indicate your :\nstatement construed as indention of (\nfederal reserve bank not to discount\nnotes secured by cotton. Satisfied ibis\nnot your policy. Statements r<f Gov- (J\nernor Harding in his Cleveland speech j\n[defining orderly marketing was reas- ]\nsuring to entire trade. If you are in\naccord can you not issue statement as I\nto what you meant by \'orderely mar*\nketing\'? Any course other than that ]\n" outlined by Governor Harding would\nresult in speculation by mills and buy- ,\ners.at expense of producers."\nRePly of Houston. ]\nSecretary Houston\'s reply of the :\n29th states: |j\n"My statement is, "I am in favor of 1\nevery legitimate effort to promote the I\norderly marketing of all commodi- ties,\nhut the government can not be a L\nparty to an undertaking to hold commodities\noff the market to enable the 1\n| owners artificially for speculative pur- J\nposes to maintain war prices or higher 7\n. than war prices/\' ]\nm "In speaking of the government, of 1\nI course, I was speaking particularly of *\nthe treasury. I was not speaking of I\n*\nthe banks. They are not the govern-1\nment. My statement was induced by a\nrequest of people that the treasury\neither deposit money in crop moving\nsections or that it revive the war\nf finance corporation activities. Either!\nof these things would necessitate the\ntreasury borrowing more money at ,\nr the high rates at which it is now borrowing\nto meet current obligations. ,\nIt has no money to deposit except for\ngovernment purposes. The war finance\ncorporation would only assist in I.\nfinancing exports. This power was ;\ngiven at a time "when it was feared\nthat exports would no? go forward.\nExports have increased steadily to\nenormous proportions and are now\nrunning at the rate of over $8,000,000\nfor the year.\nCould Not Borrow.\n"Obviously the treasury would not\nbe warranted in borrowing money to\nI further stimulate exports or to deposit\nfor lending purposes.

There is no conflict be- j\nI tween my statement and Governor ;\n* Harding\'s. He was speaking for the\nreserve system. I have assured that\nI am in favor of the orderly marketI\ning of all commodities. Governor 1\nI Harding asserts the same. The banks\nare lending more money today to\nagriculture and industry than has\never before been lent. I have repeatedly\nexpressed myself in favor\n> of orderly marketing and of the proi.\nmotion of cooperative marketing\namong farmers. I do not see how I\nI can add anything to the statement.\niMy insistence on the desirability of\norderly marketing is pointed to my\nstatement as to the unwisdom of enterprises\nto hold commodities off the\nmarket artificially for speculative\npurposes to maintain war prices or\nhigher than war prices. I assume that\nr the great mass of the people of this\ncountry would recognize not only the\nunwisdom hut the illegality of such\nan undertaking."\nXo Danger of Panic.\nIn publishing this correspondence\nMr. Byrnes state# he was satisfied\nthat the speculators know that the\nsecretary of the treasury was stating\nthe policy* of the treasury depart\nCENSUS GUESSES.\nG.

WOOLSEY FORMS ALLIANCE\nAGAINST WEEVIL.\nHas Pedigreed Herd.\nBreeze Hill Plantation Boasts Many\nPotential Prize Winners?Extension\nService Raised.\nAiken, Oct. 2.?Breeze Hill plantation,\nthe home of C. B. Woolsey\'s\nherd double standard polled Herefords,\nis primarily a cotton planta-j\ntion but pedigreed cattle are raised\nthere as well as pedigreed cottonseed.\nMr. Woolsey believes that cattle help\nthe cotton and that cotton helps the\ncattle, and that, together with some\nhogs, they make the best combination\nto meet boll weevil conditions in\nthis section. j\nTo raise cattle, however, he says\nyou must have, besides cotton, good\npastures in summer and fenced fields\nto graze in winter, with peas and velvet\nbeans in your corn and grain\ncrops as cover in your cotton and, last\nbut not least, silage to carry them\nthrough the late winter and early\nspring. !\nLast year he showed two polled\nheifers that won the two year old\nand junior yearling classes and a\njunior champion, and this year will\nhave a larger herd on exhibition at\nthe state fair.\nLike so many other pure bred breed!\ners, he started with grades and, findI\ning them a success, two years ago he\nI bought at auction his first registered,\n| double standard, polled female, a\nyearling heifer, and since then, has\nI bought eagerly whenever polled Herefords\nhave been offered at auction\nin the southeast, as well as at private\nsales, but he prefers to buy at\nauction.\nHe says that he has always found\nthe extension service men the farmers\'\nbest friends in all farming operations,\nbut that in the purebred cattle\nbusiness, which is rather new to this\nsection, their advice is especially\nneeded, and that the present quality\nof Lis heed is largely due to the assistance\ngiven him by the extension\nservice beef cattle expert, W. J. Sheely,\nwho has been his "guide, philosopher\nand friend" in the cattle business\nand has assisted him in picking\nout the bulk of his herd.\nAmong his purchases are included\n"Sunflower" (6713) 494880, the top\npriced female at the association sale\nheld in Atlanta in March, 1919, and\na show heifer by "Polled* Victor"\n(which he bought at the Chandler dis-\'\nI norsinn sate, ^nin? there last Decern-1\nber after the international party\nfrom South Carolina dispersed at\nChicago. Be paid $1,125 for this\nheifer but an unfortunate injury received\nin shipping home will prevent\nher being seen at the fair. She has\na bull calf by the $14,500 Marvel\'s\nPride that looks like a worthy son of\nan illustrious father.\nMr. Woolsey\'s herd includes almost\nall the principal strains of polled\nblood, and every animal is strongly\n"anxiety" herd, very large through\n"Beau Donald."\nAmong his exhibit will be found\nhis winning two year old of last year,\n"Belle Mapleton" (17569) 625449,\nnow a mature cow with a calf, and a\nfull sister showing as a junior yearling.\nThese two will be shown together\nas produce of cow. They are\ngrandaughters of the famous "Dominion."\nOne of the most interesting features\nof Mr. Woolsey\'s exhibit will\nbe a heifer owned and fed by his son,\nCon vers K. Woolsey. The heifer\nweighed 422 pounds when received\n(December 31, 1919, and she will\nprobably be sold at auction with the\ncalves of other calf club boys after\nthe judging.\nLast but most important of this\nherd is the herd bull "Prince Charm\ning" (19554) 797945, whose breeding\ncombines the blood of "Perfection\nFairfax" through the grand\nchampion "Fairfax 16th" and the\ngreat polled bull "Tony" on his sire\'s\nside, while his dam is a daughter of\n"Bright Stanway," tracing on her\ndam\'s side to "Beau Modest." This\nbull is truly a remarkable combination\nof famous blood lines. He is a\nthick fleshed, heavy quartered bull\nwith great bone, yet close to the\nground, and should furnish strong\ncompetition with the assembly of\nother good bulls to be seen this year\nin the senior yearling class in which\nCOMPILES REPORT\nON COTTON CROP\nSAYS CONDITION\'S INDICATE\nSMALLEST YIELD IN YEARS.\nWill Be Low Grade.\nAmerican Cotton Association Reports\non Condition of Plant.\nQuantities Ungathered.\nThe report of the American Cotton\nassociation on the condition of the\ncotton crop up to September 25\nshows the condition to be ob./, -according\nto figures given out last\nweek. A supplementary report up\nto September 28 shows additional\ndeterioration, according to the association.\nThe report following was given out\nby J. Skottowe Wannamaker, president\nof the American Cotton association:\nA most thorough investigation into\nthe condition of the growing cotton\ncrop up to an average date of September\n25 brings to light the following\nfacts which will cause the\n1920 cotton crop to go down in history\n^marked and followed by the following\nrecord breaking conditions:\nThe first government report showed\nthe lowest condition in the last 50\nyears.\nThere will be the greatest amount\nof unharvested cotton from any crop\nin the last 50 years.\nBefore the 1921 crop reaches the\nmarket, the growing crop will sell for\nthe highest price of any crop within\nthe last 50 years.\n| It will be followed by a crop showing\nthe greatest reduction in acreage\nof any cotton crop planted within the\nlast 50 years.\nThe end of the cotton year (July\n3 V 1921) will show the smallest\namount of surplus cotton carried over\nof any similar period within the\nlast 50-years.\n| It will be followed by the most\nt\n1 complete change tor the better in the\nagricultural life of the south which\nhas taken place within the last 50\nyears, as result or cooperation.\n-Recognizing the fact that this\ngrowing cotton crop, had the law of\nsup-ply and demand heen permitted to\nfunction, would have broken all records\nin the last 50 years as to high\nprices and realizing the vital importance\nof securing the most accurate\ninformation obtainable concerning\nnot only the condition of this crop and\nthe indicated yield, but all important\nfactors that will enter into the next\nproduction, due to the pressing demand,\nworld wide, for raw cotton,\nonce normal laws are permitted to\nfunction, this report was prepared\nafter a most thorough investigation\nthrough questionnaires, letters, telegrams\nand personal investigation.\nThe condition up to an average\ndate of September 25 shows 56.7.\n\' Will be Small Yield.\nHowever, we find that the yield, as\nindicated by the condition, will be\nsmaller than at any time within the\nlast 50 years. Prom the last cotton\ncrop there was gathered 500,000\nbales of bollies and snaps. From the\nindicated yield of this cotton crop,\nas shown bv our report and by the re\nport of the government, must be deducted\nthe snaps and hollies as well\nas a tremendous amount of low grade\ncotton, which will not be gathered\nunder any condition, but which will\nbe left in the fields for feed for cattle\nand for compost.\nThis crop will be a low grade crop,\ndue not only to adverse weather conditions\nand to the shortage of labor,\nbut also due to the abnormal condition\nof the crop and to insect damage.\nThe entire crop in a large portion\nof the belt is all opening at one\ntime, which will result in lowering\nthe grades on account of exposure\nto the weather due to insufficient labor\nto harvest same.\nWe find that the crop is from three\nto four weeks late and an early frost\nwould greatly reduce the indicated\nyield. The cotton is poorly fruited,\nlie is entered.\nThe herd of Breeze Hill plantation\nnow numbers over 20 registered animals\nand over 30 grades and is increasing\nwith practically 100 per\ncent, calf crop of all cows old enough\nto breed. This is the only registered\npolled Hereford herd in South Carolina\nand will attract much notice\nthrough the excellent exhibit which\nits owner -will have at the coming\nstate fair.\n*\nGUILTY OX MURDER CHARGE.\nW%h Smith Sentenced to Life Imprisonment.\nOrangeburg, Sept. 30.?The jury\nI in the case of the state against Wash\nSmith, the negro charged with the\nmurder of Magistrate Jeff D. Wiggins,\nof Eutawville, rendered a cerdict\nof guilty of murder with recommendation\nto mercy. Judge Mauldin\nat once passed sentence upon the\nprisoner, which is life imprisonment.\nThe case next called was that of\nElijah Douglass and his son Otis\nDouglass, charged with the murder of\nFuller Sanford near Norway on\nChristmas eve of 1918. Elijah Douglass\nwas convicted of murder, with\nrecommendation to mercy, while his\nson Otis was convicted of manslaughter\nand given five years. The case\nwas appealed to the supreme court,\nand a new trial granted both defendants.\nWhen the case was called this\nafternoon the solicitor agreed to\nElijah iDouglas pleading guilty of\nmanslaughter, while the solicitor nol\nprossed the case against Otis Douglass.\nSentence will be passed upon Elijah\nDouglass Friday morning, Judge\nMauldin taking the testimony to get\nfamiliar with the case. This case created\nconsiderable interest in this\ncounty at the time of trial. Fuller\nSanford went to the home of Elijah\nDouglass and attempted to steal his\ndaughter, and a fight followed near\nthe home of Douglass, resulting in the\ndeath of Sanford. Messrs. Wolfe and\nBerry, Brantley and Zeigler, Julian\nS. Wolfe and J. H. Fanning represented\nDouglass and his son, while\nMessrs. T. M. Raysor and A. H.

An rtTT\nntory ana iar more senuuo mau ever\nbefore recorded. In addition to\nreducing the production, the boll\nweevil has greatly damaged the grade\nby puncturing full grown bolls. *\nWill Reduce Acreage.\nThe most thorough and scientific\nplans have been put into force in every\ncounty in the cotton belt for the\npurpose of absolutely assuring a reduction\nin cotton acreage for 1921\nby 33 1-3 per cent. The farmers,\nthe merchants, the bankers, the busness\nmen and professional men are\nthoroughly organized behind this\nmovement. Producers are signing,\nnot pledges, but contracts. The banks\nare requiring the signing of those\ncontracts, binding the producer to\nthe reduction, before they will make\nadvances on cotton being carried from\nthe growing cotton crop.\nA record breaking acreage of small\ngrain is being planted and will be\nplanted this fall, and an enormous increased\nacreage in food\' and feed\ncrops will be planted next spring.\nCotton will be planted as a surplus\ncrop.\nThe cotton producer, as a result of\nhis organization, realizes today more\nthoroughly than ever before that it\nis only through a small cotton crop\nthat he can secure a profitable price;\n, that all records of the past show that\na small crop brings a greater return\nthan a large crop. He realizes\nthat the enormous spread of the boll\nweevil adds to the great hazard of\ncotton production; that labor and all\ncommodities necessary to the production\nof cotton show an enormous increase.\nThe farmer, the merchant,\nthe banker; in fact, the entire agricultural\nand commercial life of the\nsouth, is thoroughly alarmed.\nRealizing that nature requires a\nfixed period between planting and\nharvesting and that deflation means\nthe absolute certainty of a loss to the\nproducer, a canvass of every section\nof thesbelt justifies the positive statement\nthat the 1921 cotton crop will\nshow the greatest reduction in acre-|\nage ever shown in the last 50 years,!\nand that the question of sufficient\nsupplies of raw cotton which would\nhave been of serious concern to the\nworld long before this, were normal\nconditions prevailing, will be one of\nthe most serious questions that will\nconfront the manufacturer, and the\nconsumer of cotton goods, even with\nthe most favorable weather conditions\nfor the 1921 cotton crop.\nSLUMP IN PRICES\nBEING EXTENDED\nconsumers soon to get ben.\nEFITS OF DROP.\n\'- A\nPublic Now Exacting.\n?!\nWave Begun by Wholesalers to be\nReflected by the Retailers.?Substantial\nReductions. #\nWashington.?Price cutting has\ntaken hold of the wholesale trade to\nan extent that soon must be felt substantially\nin lower prices to the consumer,\naccording to the federal reserve\nboard\'s monthly business review,\nmade public last week.\nRevival nf thp w?vp nf nrirrp rftriur\ntion and its spread to many retail\nlines was attributed to a "more exacting\ndemand by the buying public V.\nas to price and quality." Retail purchasers\nare showing continued determination\nto await a move by dealers\nto meet those demands while foregoing\nluxuries and semi-luxuries reports\nto the board declared. ~\nAlthough the board believed that\nthe buying public was largely dominating\nthe market now, it is said that\nlabor and production were having a\nmarked effect on prices. There was\nmuch evidence, it said, of increased\nefficiency on the part of labor and as\na result production was on the increase\nand factory operation beginning\nto approach normal.\nStability Returning.\n\\r\nSummed up, the board\'s findings\nwere that business conditions now\nare definitely on the road towards\nstability of as great and confirmed\na nature as the disturbed position of\nthe world at large permits.\n"Continuance of the process of readjustment\nin business and industry\nhas been an outstanding feature of\nthe last month," the review said. ?\n"This has been accompanied by price\nreductions and the resumption of\nwork in branches of industry where\nhesitation as to the future outlook\nhas led to suspicion. . * ;\n"After an apparent slowing\' down\nof the price reduction movement during\nmidsummer, it has again appeared\nand the month of September saw\nsubstantial reductions in several of j J\nthe well known makes of automobiles,\nvarious classes of textiles,,\nshoes and leather and other wholesale\nprices. Reductions have occurred\nin a variety of staples, including\nwheat. The changes in prices have\ntended to make business men and\nbankers cautious about future commitments.\nDrops in prices have featured almost\nall of the textile lines, agents\nof the various reserve banks report4\n. .\ned, and they added that, due to reductions\nalready announced by the\nwholesalers and jobbers the retailers\nare buying carefully and not in\nlarge quantities. The retailers\' attitude\nwas depicted as necessarily\nconservative for the reason that a\nmarket with a downward trend leaves\na\nhim with the alternative* of taking a\nloss or keeping his shelves stocked\nwith high priced goods.\nShoes to be Lower.\nSimilar influences were shown to\nbe bearing on the shoe and leather industry.\nIn these lines particularly\nthe reports of the board disclosed the\ninfluence of a demand lessened by\nhigh prices is strong and gives no\nindication of weakening. Because\nnf this aDDarent sentiment, the re\nview stated, retailers are postponing\nbuying or are buying only for current\nrequirements.\nWhile housing conditions were represented\nas being acute .in all communities,\nthe board figures held out\nhope for an early renewal of all construction.\nMaterial prices show the\neffect of price cutting in other commodities\nand "certainly have passed\nthe peak," the review said.\nChicago and environs have been\nmost favored with price reductions\nin building materials and construction,\nwhere, according to the board\'s\nreport, prices fell between 15 and 25\nper cent, during the last 30 days. The\nfeeling was said to prevail that price\nrevision in this, like other lines of\ntrade, was due to spread.\nMore Below.\nCountrywoman (her first glimpse\nx -t. ?\nof the sea)?"Ain\'t it astoni&um ,\nWilliam?

No. 40.\nThursday, October 7,1920.\nOUGHT TO BE RECOUNT.\nThat the census figures announced\nfor Bamberg are wrong is apparent\non the face of it, and whatever steps\nnecessary to secure a revision or recount\nought to be taken by the city\nauthorities without delay. The city\nis credited with a population of 2,210,\nan increase of 273, or 14.1 per cent,\nover the population figures of 1910.\nIn 1910, we are informed, the cotton\nmill was closed down, and the\nmill help had moved away. The mill i\nemployed about 40 or 50 hands at\nthat time. The mill now employs\n160 hands, which means a population\nof possibly 400. None of these\npeople were in Bamberg ten years\nago.\nTen years ago houses were plentiful\nin Bamberg. Today no houses\nare to be had. Owners of houses\ncommand any rent they ask. There\nhas not been the building operations\ngoing on here for the last ten years\nthere should have been, yet many\nhouses have been erected, and there\nwas, we believe, not an empty house\nin Bamberg when the 1920 census\nwas taken.\nThe normal growth of the town, if\nno new inhabitants had been added\nto the population, in ten years should\nhave been from 10 to 20 per cent.\nThere is scarcely a resident of Bamberg\nwho cannot count several hundred\npersons who have moved here\nin the last few years, and practically\nall the loss, aside from death, that\n, \\ the town has sustained has been from\n\\ a lack of housing facilities.\n\\ Yet Bamberg shows an increase of\nonly 273 persons, which is only a\nfraction over 14 per cent, growth.\nConservative persons have estimated\ntfrat the town had a population of at\nleast 3,000.\niBarnwell made a gain of more than\n40per cent., yet one of the Barnwell\npapers recently pointed to Bamberg\nas an example of progress. Shall we\ncontent ourselves in accepting an official\npopulation of 2,210 for the next\'*\nten years. All of the county seats\nin chis section have been given material\nincreases. If Bamberg had no\nmore than 2,210 inhabitants it would\nbe all right for the official count to\nremain as announced, but many of\nthe inhabitants of Bamberg are not\nincluded in the count, according to\ntheir own statements. Whole families\nwere omitted, we are informed.\nOther cities have secured recounts,\nand if the proper pressure is brought\na correct census of Bamberg will be\ntaken. The interests of the town demand\nthat Bamberg be credited with\na full population statement. The census\nis taken to secure correct population\nfigures.\nTHE COTTON ASSOCIATION.\nIf the farmers ever needed an organization\nit is now. They need an\norganization that has teeth to it. They\nTr-oiiQ^ +r\\r\\ inn or Pnttnr) is too\nlieIVC YfOHCU IUU ivii;5. www?\nimportant a crop to be neglected as\nit has been in the past. Cotton is\nthe backbone of the south, weevil or\nno weevil, and it is likely to remain\nthe south\'s backbone. The weevil\nwill be overcome, and the south will\ncontinue to grow cotton, perhaps not\non so large a scale as formerly; nevertheless,\nit will continue to look Jto\ncotton as its heaviest crop.\nBut there is absolutely a lack of\nsystem in marketing cotton. The\ncotton producer has no voice whatever\nin fixing the price of his product.\nHe takes whatever is offered him or\nhauls his cotton back home, to suit\nhis convenience, and wThen he does\nsell, he still has only the offer the\nbuyers make him, and the local buyers,\nof course, can only conform to\nthe general price.\nOther producers have some voice in\nsaying what their produce is worth.\nThe cotton farmer has none. If he\nis compelled to pay out 30 cents a\npound to make his crop, and the\nprice fixers decide to pay only 20,\nt that is the farmer\'s hard luck. He\nhas no way of fixing the price to\ncover production cost, plus a profit.\nOnce in a while he makes a profit\non his crop, but it is a matter of\nchance. The manufacturer, however,\nsells his product at a price to cover\nmanufacturing cost with a profit added,\nwhich is nothing but right. But\nthe farmer stands all the loss. He\nshould be able to command a cost\nplus profit price as well as the man^\nufacturer.\nIt seems to us that it is plainly to J\nthe interest of every farmer in Bam-1\nberg county to ally himself with the\ncotton association, and make up his\nmind to go into it in a whole hearted\nmanner. The trouble heretofore has\ni\nbeen with farmers\' organizations that\nthe farmer would stick only so long\nas his immediate interests were affected.\nIf the cotton farmers will ally i\nthemselves with the association, and \'\n| the association will fix a right and !\ni fair price for cotton, that price will\nbe paid, and it seems to us that there\nwill never be the hope of a staple\nprice for cotton until some such action\nis taken. Farmers are entitled\nto receive for their products every\ncent that it costs an average farmer\nto make the crop and a living profit\nI added to it. Everybody is entitled j\nI to this much. It is not necessary\n[ to the prosperity of the country that\'\nany man should work free, or sell\nhis goods for less than a profitable\nprice.\ni?I m*\nThe Herald has not found it necessary\nto secure additional help to receive\ncontributions to the Democratic\ncampaign fund.

Further,\nit should \'be remembered that\nsome decidedly interesting reading\nmay be found regarding the bravery\nAmprinnn soldiers at the very\nU1 tUV i.JLUA\\/A AVWX.\nmoment when they were going to war\nif Harding\'s record is scanned. Indications\nare that so far as the senate\nis concerned, that body may and very\nlikely will \'swing back into the Democratic\ncolumn. There are many reasons\nto support this assertion.\nIt should be remembered that at\nthis time the Republican majority in\nthe senate is of the slimmest kind,\nonly two more Republicans than there\nare Democrats. Therefore, almost any\nkind of change, for instance, if Sen.\nator Smoot of Utah should be defeated,\nand there are reasons to be believed\nhe will be, and Watson of Indiana\nshould also go into the discard,\nthat would only leave one more\nchange from the Republican to the\nDemocratic column to put the matter\nover. Seriously, there are evidences\nthat there will be four or five such\nchanges this year.\nSenator Wadsworth of New York is\nanother Republican slated to hit the\ntoboggan. He has taken a stand\nagainst suffrage whuch has caused\nhim to make many enemies in his\nstate. Mrs.v Wadsworth is one of the\nmost pronounced anti-suffrage women\nin the entire country, and naturally,\nthe New York senator and Mrs.\nwaaswortn nave mougnt ana actea\nalike on this matter. That Wadsworth\nis scheduled to go this year,\nalong with others from the G. O. P.\nline-up, is no secret here. In fact,\nit seems to he the opinion of the senator\nhimself that he is to have his\nofficial head chopped off.\nReports from the East are also that\nthere are still other changes to come\nabout which, figuring accurately,\nshould permit the Democrats to overcome\nthe present lead of two which\nthe Republicans have on them and\npossibly pick one or two other seats.\nThe house situation permits of the\nbelief that not only will the present\nRepublican majority be overcome, but\nthat it will be entirely wiped out.\nWhy?\nRepublic3!^ Divided.\nAny one who has kept track of legislative\naffairs in the house since the\nRepublicans secured control can not\nJUL^iy seeing tlio. 1/ tJJiiO ksi &am^a uvu xo\nbadly split. Take the situation, for\nexample, when the soldier bonus bill\nwas up for consideration. "Jim"\nMann of Illinois, one of the real old\ntimers in the G. 0. P. line-up but a\nman who will not always do what his\nparty wants him to do "when he knows\nit is wrong, broke completely out of\nthe reservation and said that the rule\nwhich the Republicans were attempting\nto pass in order to get the bonus\nbill through, not giving the Democrats\ntheir rights in the matter, was\n"outrageous." He protested against\nthis form of "gag" rule and it was\nnot the first time he has done so.\nAlmost every day, under the Mondell\nleadership, it is necessary for\nthis leader to send for Mr. Mann to\nhelp him out of a bad parliamentary\nsituation. The present Republican\nhouse is further from being a solid\nbody than it has been since the time\nwhen "Uncle Joe" Cannon was lifted\nfrom the speaker\'s chair because the\nhouse rose in mutiny at his arbitrary\nand autocratic management. Before\nthat time there was solid harmony,\nbut the Republicans have never been\nexactly the same since.\nAll the big tales that the Republican\ncandidates are telling concerning\ntheir wonderful achievements are being\ndiscounted by the voters. You\nmight fool them once, but not now.\nIt looks like a Democrat\'s victory all\nalong the line.?P. H. McGowan, in\nWashington disDatch.\nmm imt\nJust received, shipment of American\nWire Fence.

That these low levels have not\nbeen reflected to a greater degree in\nthe retail prices of meats is due to\nthe tremendous decrease in the value\nof various of the by-products.\nBoth hides and wool, which are\nbig credits toward the cost of cattle\nand sheep, are selling at tremendous\ndiscounts over the prices of a year\nago.\nEven so, meat at wnoiesaie is nearer\npre-war levels than most other essentials.\nThere are no immediate\nprospects for further reductions in\nthe wholesale prices of meat, but the\nexcellent corn crop now in the making\ngives promise of cheaper productions\ncosts in the future and will ,\nprobably imake further price reductions\nnext year.\nGetting back to normal is highly\ndesirable, buf in the case of foods, .\nproducers have alaready suffered heavy\nlosses and if adequate production\nis to be maintained these losses must\nnot be augmented.\nJulius Rosenwald, president of :\nSears, Roebuck & Co., for the first\ntime outlined some of the price re- .\ncessions made recently by his firm: <\n"Standard nercale which was 40 "\ncents a yard, we are now offering at\n19 cents," said Mr. Rosenwald. "Silk <\ntaffetas formerly $2.57 a yard, are *\nnow $1.48;. sheeting,\' formerly 27 j\ncents a yard, now 15 cents; muslin 35\ncents, now 15 cents; flannel, 43 cents\nnow 29 cents."\nCan You Boat This One?\ni\nA prominent farmer of this city f\nstated to us one day last week that <\non the Sunday before while some of the\nnegroes on his place were sitting *\non their porch they noticed a bird fall (\ndead in the corner of the yard and ;\ndecided that they would cut it open\nand, if possible, ascertain the cause !\nof its death. Upon opening the craw\nthey discovered a live boll weevil, i\nwhich had punctured the craw of the ^\nbird in several places, thereby caus- ;\ning its death.\nRecords for all makes of talking :\nmachines always on hand.

Black!\nsmokes were seen ascending from the\nchimneys and the "old woman" had\nto dig down into the quilt box and\nget out heavy covering for the beds.\nThe change coming so suddenly made\nit feel colder that it really was.\nThe year 1920 (leap year) known\nas the time the fair sex has the opportunity\nof courting and "popping\nthe question," will soon be over for\nthis period. So far it has been fatal\nwith the widowers in this section;\nabout a half dozen of whom have fell\nvictims to purchasing marriage licenses.\nSeems when a young man\nmeets the proposal he gives it the ha,\nha, but the old widowers! When they\nare asked, "darling do you love me?"\nthe heart is so soft they can only\nanswer (half audibly) "yes, my love."\nCheer up, girls, there are three or\nfour around here yet, and, remember,\n1924 is a long time off.\nPlenty of cotton coming to the\ngins and owing to the price we no^\ntice that nearly every wagon is returning\nhome, the bale on it.\nJ. E. Folk suffered a painful accident\nthe first of September, getting\nhis left ankle broken. He is just\nable now to hobble to the postoffice\nand back.\nThe sportsmen are out now hunting\nthe fox. It is fine sport. The lady\nfolks join in sometimes with their\nautos. Some of the farmers are\nguilty of watching their sugar cane\npatches pretty closely when they hear\nthe hunters coming, because most\nhunters agree that the commandment\n"thou shalt not steal" applies in all\ncases except watermelons and sugar\ncane.\nWHEN WIVES WERE SOLD.\nNew Bern, X. C., Man Sold His Wife\nin 1804.\nIn rummaging through the records\nat the court house here and other\npublic records in the eastern part of\nthe state occasionally some remarkable\ndocuments are found, says a\nBeaufort, N. C., dispatch. Such an\ninstance occurred a few days ago\nwhen B. M. Potter, a civil engineer\nof New Bern, was examining some\nrecords in the clerk\'s office here. He\nran across a document which sets\nforth that in December, 1804, one\nAbner Willis sold his wife for the\nsum of $2, furthermore he states that\nhe was "truly satisfied."\nThe bill of sale which was probated\nby the clerk of court of common\npleas and quarter sessions reads as\nfollows:\n"This indenture, made this 14th\nday of December, eighteen hundred\nand four, between Abner Willis of\nthe state of North Carolina and county\nof Cartaret, of the one parte, and\nWilliam W. Oliver, of the other\nparte.\n"Witnesseth: That I, Abner Willis,\nhave bargained and delivered unto\nWm. W. Oliver .one certain white\nwoman by the name of Mace, which\nis or was formerly, my wife, for the\nsum of two dollars, the receipt I here\nby acknowledge myself truly satisfied.\nIn witness hereof I place my\nhand and seal the day and years first\nwritten.
