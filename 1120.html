This lias been brought about, by the unwatering of the big, Smuggler mires th:o g i the Free, Silver shaft which has a denth of, 1200 feet that wasal\'o’ed to fill, up in 1897 and had remain-d so, until recently, twode p sea divers, I were employed to go down the, | water filled shaft «nd succeeded, ;in starting the submerged, | pump which was operated until, |\'he shaft whs drained to the lx>t, t"m. Rig electri • pnmps have, I lieen installed in duplicate having, sufiic’er.t capacity for ell emergen, cies. It is \'stimated that an «rea, of three miles square will lie, drain\' d from this big shaft which, inehid s nearly itfl the old b\'g, mines of the canvp which are, alxmt twenty in numVr. The, Smuggler property is the largest I, of the district and has the lurgest, bodies of high grade silver ores, of any mine, and the company, h"s h for«-e of 250 miner-* now em, ployed nnd it is expected that the, mine will soon be able to resume, its former production of several, million dollars worth of ore ann, ually. i, - * 1, New® Champion states th»t, renew\' d activity is • xpected in, the Guni\'i«o«i g-Id l«|t wines the, present season and that the Good, Hope and Turner properties will!, probably be operated. With so j, many new proeess-s for the ex I, traction of cold in low grade ores, it would seem pr babl- that there, are maoy big deposits in this, dis\'ric\', that c uld be wor\'-ed »t, good profits. In Cripple C.*e-k, they are now tr a\'i"g ores which, run 0"ly one dollar p- r ton in, gold. Ti\'ere is 1 ttle question to, the fact that millions of tons of:, quartz. exi-t in the big vei"S ol |, the Gunnison gold belt which will;, assay better than three dollars in :, gold p-r ton ns tln-y «re quarri d I, from the mines There «re massive, ledg\'s of quartz in many instances j, fifty to one hundred feat thick, that will awrage two and three, dollars gold values per ton, the, depth of their d>‘p isitc. Itis lidped, that some systematic prospecting, a ill be done in this district the, •oming season and confidently, believed that when this is done,, big results will follow. The gold, is there without doubt «s thou, sands of assays have been made,, which | rove this statement rot to, be theory but that the values, actual\'y exist us shown from the, gold buttons obtained., The U.

He may have a mine of, facts that justify his action beyond, all possible cavil.

The peti, tioners are those who had Initiated, rights to coal lands in Routt county,, Colorado, prior to the withdrawal act, —expending from SIOO to $250 on each j, claim. They seek an amendment of, the oil act to save to them the same, rights as extended to oil prospectors, under that measure, and such a bill, will be Introduced soon.

The theory that the federal gov, ernment has the right to withdraw, from entry and hold for an indefinite, length of time any considerable por, tion of the territory of Colorado or, any other Western state is of a com, paratively recent growth.
