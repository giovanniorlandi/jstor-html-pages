She may have been too\ntired or the ethics of right and wrong\nmay have been lost in her soul in her\nstruggle with life. At ahy rate she\nnever answered the boy.\nBut a probation officer enlightened\nthe lad. He told Lester that not only\nwas his father down in Joliet peniten\ntiary, but that he was there for a good\nlong stay, and he told Lester also that\nthe man who was supposed to be his\nfather wasn\'t his father at all and\nthat his mother has been three times\nin the Bridewell.\nLester received this knowledge\nwhen he was 8 years old. He had\nhis world turned topsy-turvy when\nhe was a child. He learned not only\nthat there is much sin in the world,\nbut that he was the offspring of it,\nnourished on it, surrounded by it and j\nhelplessly .and hopelessly to be drag\nged down with it\nThey sent him to the St. Mary\'s\ntraining school at the age when a\nprobation officer told him his status\nin the world. That was in 1907.\nIn March, 1908, he ran away from,\nthe home and a few days later was\nfound and sent back. In October of\nthe same year he ran away again and\nwas caught before he got to Chicago\nand taken back.\nIn December of that same year the\nlad of 9 was discharged as an im\npossible case by the St. Mary\'s train\ning school and was sent to the Glen\nwood manual training school as a de\nlinquent boy.\nHe remained in Gleenwood eigfit\neen months when his mother, just re-.\nleased from an institution, claimed J\nhim. In 1910 his mother left him,\nand again Lester was sent as a de\npendent boy this time to Allendale\nFarm at Lake Villa, HI.\nIn August, 1911, he ran away with\nthree other boys and in the spring of\n1912 was arrested in South Chicago\nwith other boys for stealing and sent\nto St. Charles reform school. In Oc\ntober, 1913, he was discharged from\nthere and that same month was ar\nrested for stealing and sent to the\nJohn "Worthy school\nOn Dec. 3 of thi? year Lester was\nagain turned loose, given a dollar and\ntold to go find a job\nLester is free for the time being7\nbut his freedom means to him only\nthat he is out of ar institution.
