        <pre>['a Corresponding author: ibardashkin@tpu.ru \nReformation and transformation of charity work at the beginning \nof the new time \nIgor B. Ardashkin1a, Alexander A. Bykov2  \n1Tomsk Polytechnic University, 634050 Lenin Avenue, 30, Tomsk, Russia \n2Tomsk State University, 634050 Lenin Avenue, 36, Tomsk, Russia \nAbstract. This article is aimed at studying the transformation of Christian charity at the beginning of the \nNew Time and the analysis of changes ongoing in this sphere. The authors of this research start with the \nanalysis of the situation that had been formed in the economy, culture and activity of the Roman Catholic \nChurch in the late Middle Ages. Such a preliminary excursion into the historical domain is not coincidental. \nIt assists understanding the reasons for the Reformation and later events. However, “in the beginning was \nthe Word”, therefore, the text analyzes the ideas of such founding fathers of Protestantism as Martin Luther, \nJohn Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli. The new ideology along with the sociocultural and socioeconomic factors \npromoted the formation of a radically different and more creative social system, also including the charity \nsphere that became more rational, practical and rough. \nIntroduction \nThe Reformation is the name for one of the largest \nevents in the world history whose title encompasses the \nwhole period of the New Time, from the 16th to the first \nhalf of the 17th centuries (“the reformation period” of \n1517-1648). Though this course of events is quite often \nmore exactly called the religious or church reformation; \nin reality, it had greater importance being a crucial \nmoment both in the religious, as well as political, \ncultural and social history of the Western Europe [1]. \nIn the 15th century, and entirely probable in the 14th \ncentury, there occurred a “latent” preparation for the \nreformation period. A rise in the economy, trade and \nculture was observed, but the main “point” of growth \nwas the development of towns and cities. F. Brodel \ncalled towns the electric transformers: they increase \nstrain, accelerate exchange, constantly control the lives \nof people. There indeed formed one of the most ancient \nand revolutionary of all the divisions of labor: fields, on \nthe one hand, and the so-called urban activities, on the \nother [2]. In truth, all the radical changes in the world \nhistory are connected with the growth of towns and cities \nin one way or another: these are both the city-states of \nthe Sumerian, the polis cities in the Ancient Greece and \nItaly, mere towns of medieval Italy as an economic and \nmental foundation for the Renaissance [3].  \nIt was exactly in towns that innovative types of \nactivities were born, as well as new organization forms, \ntechnologies and methods of management. The towns \nwere places of formation for such progressive types of \nclosed philanthropic institutions as poorhouses, \nhospitages, houses of mercy, later hospitals, etc. The city \nis always creative, even in the most ritual and stagnant \nages. The reason for this lies in the peculiarities of the \nurban communication between individuals. Interaction \noccurs among people having various nature of their \nactivity, education, culture and language (though there is \nalways one language for communication available). It is \nin the cities where different social practices coincide. \nTherefore, the city of the Renaissance is a unique \nintegrity and a special environment that is obliged to \nprotect itself. The city people are always involved with \nconstructing their social reality, i.e. their oikos.  \nThus, the times preceding the Renaissance in the \nWestern Europe witnessed the process of urbanization \nthat undoubtedly influenced all the life spheres of the \nsociety, including the social one that was, above all, \nfounded on philanthropic bases.  \nThe Subject and Methods of Research \nThe authors intend to use the method of explication with \nthe help of which they plan to specify a number of \ncrucial notions connected with charity [4,5], and the \nmethod of comparative and historical analysis with the \npurpose of demonstrating the transformations that \nemerged along with the phenomenon of charity. \nThe Obtained Results \n \n, Web of Conferences 01146  (2016) DOI: 10.1051/\n  \nSHS 2 shsconf/20162808 1\nRPTSS 2015 \n146\n © The Authors,  published  by EDP Sciences.

This was \nmentioned by B. D. Porozovskaya, a Russian historian of \nthe second half of the 19th century, that: “On the one \nhand, there was the utmost degeneration of the Roman \nChurch, the moral decadence and ignorance of the clergy \nthat was accompanied by the ultimate loss of its former \ncharm in the eyes of people. On the other hand, huge \nsuccess and expansion of knowledge due to the revival \nof sciences and arts, owing to the invention of book \nprinting and a whole range of outstanding discoveries in \nthe fields of geography and astronomy, were the reasons \nthat caused dissatisfaction with the whole medieval \nsystem” [6]. \nThe system of values and norms as well as the ethical \nimage of the era was under change, and the departure \nfrom the principles of early Christianity was further \nobserved. This was described by I. Heyzinga: “It was \nexactly the combination with the primitive pride that \ngave the greediness in the late Middle Ages something \nunmediated, ardent and outrageous, that was apparently \nirrevocably lost in later times. The Renaissance and \nProtestantism filled mercenariness with ethical content, \nlegitimating it as a necessary condition for well-being. \nThe stamp on it was turning more pale, while the \nresignation of worldly goods was being recognized as \nless praiseworthy and convincing. But the late Middle \nAges time was only able to see an irresolvable \ncontradiction between the virtueless greediness and \ngenerosity or voluntary poverty” [7]. \nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Europe entered \na rather complicated and contrasting period that was to \nchange charity as a social and cultural phenomenon. \x02\nSuch tendencies as strengthening secularism and \nnationalization in the sphere of regulation and control \nwere developed further. However, “in the beginning was \nthe Word”.  \nThe reformers of the church – M. Luther, J. Calvin \nand H. Zwingli – were not only theorists of changes, but \nalso their practitioners, especially the latter two. \nIn his work “Manual on Christian Belief”, John \nCalvin justified the connection between religion and \nmercy: “It has been correctly said that differentiation is \nnot only the main constituent part of any righteousness \nand virtue; it is their life-giving soul. Without the fear of \nGod there will never be justice or mercy in the \nrelationships between people” [8]. \nIn the teaching of J. Calvin, moral and ethical \nmotives are rather strong. He underlined that “the Lord \nforbids us to humiliate our neighbor and do them harm \nbecause He wishes the life of the neighbor to be dear to \nus. Therefore, He demands from us to also commit deeds \nof mercy owing to which this life may be kept safe” [8]. \nPeople are obliged to do good to their neighbors \nsince charitable acts are an argument in favor of \ngodliness, and “love that is due to our natural corruption \ncan be directed at ourselves by ourselves and must \nspread outside so that we are ready to do the same \namount of good to others as we do to ourselves” [8]. \nJ. Calvin was thoroughly familiar with the works by \nthe ancient authors, in particular, with the philosophical \nworks by Cicero and Seneca, and, like them, he \nintroduced some moral limitations into the sphere of \ncharity work. Virtue and helping others when giving \nalms must not be motivated by vanity alone. By quoting \nthe authority of the Gospel of John, the French \nProtestantism theorist wrote that “vain people, i.e. those \nseeking the worldly glory, or people thrust with selfcomplacence\ncannot be accepted by God.” He declares \nthat “the former have already received their reward in \nthis world” (Matthew 6: 2), while “the latter are farther \nfrom the Kingdom of God than tax collectors and \nharlots” [9]. \nAnother moral limitation for charity work was the \nabsence of any hints at humiliating the one in need of \nhelp “by one’s proud look or arrogant speech”. The \nbegging person may be disliked by a merciful person or \nmay be unworthy of alms, but the “image of God” that \nwe contemplate in this person is quite worthy to be given \neverything we have” [8]. This idea of embracing God’s \nimage in the face of a beggar is nothing new. John \nChrysostom wrote: “You dress Christ by dressing a poor \none [10]; God is hidden in poverty; a poor one offers his \nhand, and God receives. When sorrow happens to you, \ngive alms at once - thanks for its happening, and you will \nsee the joy that will overwhelm you” [10]. The main \nideas and assumptions of J. Calvin’s theology altogether \ncorrespond to the common Christian semantic field. This \nis also justified by the social and psychological \nassumption – put yourself in the place of a suffering \nbeggar, penetrate deeply into the worries of the one in \nneed of help. Charitable people were to take compassion \non his/her destiny, “as if they felt its attacks themselves \nso that they feel the same compassion and mercy \ntowards them as they are able to feel for themselves” [8]. \nAn ability for empathy is the most important quality \nof the philanthropist and if it is absent, there is a cold \nand heartless following the Christian “formalities” facing \nus. The more so if the humiliation of the poor by some \n“vessels of mercy” is described by J. Calvin himself, this \nimplies that such instances were facts in everyday life. \nThe other theorist and practitioner of Protestantism, \nH. Zwingli, was clearly trying to return to the norms of \nthe early Christianity, at least as he imagined them. He \nset himself a considerably complex goal\x02 – that of \nreligious and moral reeducation of the yet non-Catholic \nsociety. The individuals who were part of the society \nwere to determine their religious identity themselves and \ncreate their own system of inner control, including help \nto those in need. \nIn practice, this meant assistance in increasing the \nmoral discipline in people, in particular, by creating \nmarriage courts, and excommunicating for sins. Laws \nagainst excessive wastefulness, drunkenness, gambling, \netc. were ordained. The last statute of 1530 was \ndistinctive for its particular severity. The number of inns \nwas limited, their holders were obliged not to sell wine \nbefore the office of the Mass, but to lock their facilities \n, Web of Conferences 01146  (2016) DOI: 10.1051/\n  \nSHS 2 shsconf/20162808 1\nRPTSS 2015 \n146\n2\n', 'no later than 9 pm or lend wine for more than 10 \nshillings [6]. \nThe severity of actions undertaken by the new church \nreminds us of the order in the early Christian \ncommunities that was based on the directions of the \nApostles’ Decrees. \nDeveloping a disciplinary record, responsibility and \nindividualism of the new community members, \nH. Zwingli admitted the existence of people in need of \nhelp, such as orphans, old people, the poor, the disabled, \nthe sick, who are always there. Thus, charity work was \ndeveloping but on new bases, though possibly being the \nforgotten old ones.  \nThere were means for charity work, first of all, due to \nsecularization of church possessions. Zurich hosted a \nwhole network of philanthropic institutions. Begging and \nclueless almsgiving were forbidden as J. Calvin would \nexpect: “ there is no place for beggars in the city”. All \nthe city or town dwellers were obliged to work. Instead \nof feeding the beggars, there were reserve shops \nestablished for helping the population in need\x03 from \nwhence special workers distributed and even delivered \ncomestibles to the poor and sick at door; poorhouses, \ninns for the poor travelers, hospitals and special plague \nhospitals were also founded [6]. \nRationalization of charitable practices during and \nafter the Reformation was the main feature for the \ndevelopment of this social and cultural phenomenon. \nMaking charity work pragmatic is genetically connected \nwith the base principle of Protestantism – replacing the \nauthority of the church and papacy with the authority of \nthe Holy Scripture texts. The realization of this principle \nenabled liberation of the energy and creativity of the \nProtestant community members and provision of more \ntargeted help to people in need. \nThe Reformation influenced the charity work in \nEurope as a whole, including the Catholic regions. The \nnew social, economic and political realities led to \nreforming the ways of helping the population. As \nK. Borgman and D. Smith suppose: “We know one thing \nfor sure: within a relatively short time, the reforms \nadvanced rapidly in a few cities at once: in 1522 – in \nNuremberg, in 1523 – in Strasbourg, in 1525 – in Mons, \nin 1525 – in Ypres, in 1527 – in Lille. Their climax was \nthe long-awaited decree on the imperial reform \npublished by Charles V in 1531. That decree covered the \nreforms that had been conducted in many towns and \ncities of the Holy Roman Empire and gave them a \nlegislative character” [11]. \nCentralization, first of all, at the level of the \nmunicipal power became the main factor for developing \ncharity work in the Western Europe. \nDuring the 16th century, many large cities managed to \ncentralize their help for the poor strata of population and \ntake control over the various philanthropic institutions \nthat were often outdated and ineffective. The alien \npeople and beggars were evicted from the cities, and the \nbeggars, who were able to work, were forced to labor. \nMany cities created centralized foundations for \nalmsgiving that were based on private donations and \nspecially introduced taxes. Such cities in the Northern \nEurope as Ypres, Nuremberg, Paris and Lion were \nexemplary for 60-70 others, both Catholic and \nProtestant, towns and cities where similar reforms were \nconducted [11]. \nThe supreme secular power in the face of the \nmonarchs did not pay special attention to the charity \nwork. In their decrees, the emperor Charles V and the \nking of France Francis I set general intentions for the \nstate’s interference in the social sphere of their epoch. In \n1520, Francis I (1494-1547) set a task of reforming the \nhospitals and king’s shelters. The main giver of the royal \nalms gave the order to place two inspectors in every \nparish – one of the clergymen and one of the laymen \nwho were supposed to collaborate in supervising the \ncourse of the reforms [11]. However, this was the \nmaximum impact of the supreme state power on the \ncharity work, while the main role in reforming the \n“godly” institutions was still played by municipalities.  \nThe experience of charity work development in \nEngland is quite interesting. After the Norman Conquest, \nthis country, as opposed to many European countries, \nwas governed more centrally. It had an influence on \nreformation of every sphere of social support of the \npopulation encouraging a serious interference of the \nroyal power and towns. Some arrangements of \nAnglicanism made by XXXIX members of the Anglican \nteaching (1563) encouraged this activity. Part XXXVIII \nsays that “the wealth and possessions of Christians in \nrelation to the right and ownership were not common as \nAnabaptists erroneously claim; still, every person was \nobliged to give alms to the poor from his possessions to \nthe best of his ability” [12]. \nReligious assumptions of Anglicanism were \nundoubtedly influencing the practical activity of the \nauthorities. Thus, “during 1540-1550 the orderly system \nof shelters was created by the London authority: some \nshelters provided care for the sick and paralytic, one of \nthem was intended for the acceptance of foundlings, and \nanother one was a location for placing the idlers and \npersons without particular activities. In general \nweakening of monasteries and other medieval godly \ninstitutions encouraged the English people to consolidate \ntheir efforts in the parish charity work and try to put the \nsystem of almsgiving into order. Henry VIII (1491-1547) \nissued a decree in accordance with which every town \nwas to establish a foundation for helping the poor. All \nthe voluntary donations (obligatory taxation was out of \nthe question) were to be handed over to the stewards of \nthese foundations, but not to the street beggars except the \ncases when the latter clearly belonged to some special \nclasses, like, for example, blind people or sailors of a \nwrecked ship [11]. \nIn 1601, England passed the “Statute on the Charity \nUse” that reflected the common Christian traditions of \nboth philanthropy and new social and economic reality. \nThe preamble listed the following charity targets: \nhelping the poor, paralytic, elder, sick and lame soldiers \nand sailors; schools, colleges and universities; fixing \nbridges, quays, havens, dams, temples, parapets and \ndriveways; educating and materially supporting the \norphans; supporting the correctional facilities; assisting \nin marriages of poor maidens; helping and supporting the \nyoung merchants and craftsmen, even in the case of their \n, Web of Conferences 01146  (2016) DOI: 10.1051/\n  \nSHS 2 shsconf/20162808 1\nRPTSS 2015 \n146\n3\n', 'financial collapse; buying war prisoners off and paying \ndebts for convicts [11]. However, private charity was \nencouraged above all. \nEngland’s system of charity work was one of the \nmost developed in Europe, still it was far from \nperfection. The European towns and cities witnessed \nmore frequent breaking the evangelical principles of \nhelping the poor. Some towns and cities could feed poor \npeople and then cast them out. This was a usual practice. \nAs F. Brodel wrote, the problem was in depriving the \npoor of the ability to do harm. In Paris, the poor and \ndisabled were always placed in hospitals, while the \nhealthy population was used at hard and wearisome \nworks, such as endless cleaning of the city’s ditches and \ndrains, what is more, they were enchained by two. In \nEngland, at the end of the Elizabeth’s reign, there \nappeared “laws on the poor” (Poor Laws) that were in \nfact the laws against the poor. Gradually, it was across \nall the West that the number of houses for the poor and \nundesirable people was multiplying, where the person \nwas sentenced to the forced labor in work houses, just as \nin the German “foundling hospitals” or French “forcing \nhouses” (French maisons de force) as, for instance, the \ncomplex of half-prisons that were united by the \nadministration of the Paris Big Hospital founded in \n1656. This “great confinement” of the poor, mentally \nsick, delinquents or sons that were thus placed under \nsupervision by their parents was one of the psychological \naspects of the society in the 17th century, a society \nprudent, but ruthless in its prudence [1]. \nThe decadence of the traditional society was \naccompanied by the erosion of the base values and \nnorms of behavior, violation of customary social \nconnections, including those that support the most \nvulnerable sectors of the society. The situation of anomie \nstarted to form in the 16th century, but still as a local \nphenomenon. The capitalist system was formed \ngradually and non-uniformly without or little \ninvolvement of the significant regions. However, in\x02 the \nmore advanced areas the population was differentiated \nand the number of the poor increased. Therefore, \nrestriction of charity work is quite a rational, though not \nentirely humanist reaction to the population \npauperization.  \nF. Brodel gave a meaningful fact: “In 1656, in Dijon, the \ncity authorities forbade their citizens to engage in private \nphilanthropy and give a shelter to the poor. In the 16th\ncentury, the alien poor were treated or fed before being \ncast out. In the 17th century, the poor had their heads \nshaved. Later the poor population was exposed to \nwhipping, and, at the end of the century, the last word of \nsuppression was to send a destitute person to the galleys. \nThis was an accurate account of the peculiarities of the \n“charitable works” in Europe” [2]. \nConclusion \nThus, with the beginning of the Reformation and \nsubsequent changes in all spheres of life, in many \nregions of Europe there were observable shifts in the \nattitude to the poor and the forms of philanthropic \nassistance. The “prudent” and rational approach to \nsupport, though being rough and still not targeted, \nbecame the main tendency for the development of the \ncharity work in the 16th – 1st half of the 17th centuries. \nThe growth of towns and cities, as well as strengthening \nof the centralized power, led to the secularism and \nnationalization of charity work, which found its \nreflection in establishing the legal base of the \nphenomenon under study. \nAcknowledgment \nThe results presented herein were obtained with the \nassistance of Russian Humanitarian Science Foundation \ngrant 15-03-14049. \nReferences \n1.
