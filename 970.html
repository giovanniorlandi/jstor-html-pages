A very, light vote was polled before., This is a matter that should, command much interest., The vote will be taken into, consideration by the bond, buyers, and the number of, votes will also indicate the, | interest and enthusiasm, ! Snowflake people have in the, betterment of district school, facilities. Simply because, one does not oppose the bond, election is no excuse for re, maining away from the elec, tion. It is the duty you owe, the school interest of this, district to go and vote., Announcement has been, made by experts that there, are 250,000 German spies in, the United States. If the, Federal officials succeed in, capturing this bunch our, penitentiaries will have to, he considerably enlarged, or, else cram them in till their, feet stick out the windows., No use to argue in favor of, hanging them. The War, Department is wedded to the, goody-goody policy of pro- 1, tecting the lives of spies by, placing them in prisons,, giving them employment, and paying them for what, ever work they do., The chairman of the State, Republican central commit, tee has written letters to, Snowflake people thanking, them for the substantial, hdp in lifting the fine im, posed on Gov.

Davison, chairman of the, American Red Cross War, council, had an audience, with King George today and, talked forty-five minutes, with the king, who thanked, him for the contribution of, $1,000,000 made recently by, the American to the British, Red Cross. The king show, ed the deepest interest in, American Red Cross activity, and displayed a surprisingly, intimate knowledge of af, fairs in America., After Mr. Davison had, given the king a detailed ac, count of the recent Red Cross, campaign in the United, States during which SIOO,-, 000,000 was raised and the, membership was increased, to 23,000,000 King George, said:, “The work the American, Red Cross is doing is the, greatest boon to humanity l, that has ever been known. |, I authorize you to express to |, the American people my, deepest thanks for the great, humanitarian work they are, doing. The British people, are most appreciative of the;, aid given by Americans and, on their behalf I want to !, congratulate the American !, people for the help they are, giving to the Red Cross. It, contributes to the morale of, all the allied peoples by its;, wonderful work.”, Gov.

J. Shumway, could not accept the presi, dency of Fair Association,, Q. R. Gardner, who had been, previously chosen as the vice, president, was elected presi, dent, and Frank Campbell, vice-president., T. C. Hoyt and F. J. Wil, lis were delegated to meet, with the Farm Bureau meet, ing at Stake house, same, evening, and ask for the co, operation of that body, that, the county fair might be in, augurated and carried to, success. Messrs. Hoyt and, Willis very ably presented, the matter to the Farm, Bureau, thus actually crystal, izing the county fair project, in away that insures success, That Snowflake is the, proper place to hold the 1918, fair all are agreed, and now, that the Farm Bureau will, take hold and help push the, matter, the fair is the com, ing event for Navajo county, for the year 1918., Committees are to be ap, pointed to take hold of the, various exhibitions, which, will be done at an early, date, then the machinery for, working out the fair will, have been set in motion., Some one is to head the com, Mr. and Mrs. Elias Smith and, daughter Bernice, accompanied, by Misses Lorano and Sophrano, Smith and Prof. Lynn Gibb, es, corted Lehi Smith to Holbrook, Sunday where • Lehi boarded, train for Idaho. After which,, Elias Smith and party took in the, Petrified Forest, a sight never, before seen by Prof. Gibb, and, all enjoyed the day to the limit., March 30 will be school trustee, election in Snowflake. Frank, Campbell's term expires. The, hold-over trustees are Marion, Flake and John Dewitt. Make, your selection to succeed Mr., Campbell and consider the good, of the school. Mr. Campbell has, served faithfully and well. Don't, forget the dste., mittee on live-stock exhibi, tions, another for dry farm, ing products exhibitions,, another for general agricult, ural products, and so on, and, women are to be named to, head art, home economics,, etc., and so on., In selecting the president, of the Fair Association the, Navajo Club considered every, possible phrase of the mat, ter, and all are agreed that, the selection is a wise one., Mr. Gardner is a man of, broad experience and con, siderable ability. His ex, ecutive qualifications will at, once be felt in the associa, tion, and the whole county, will be marshalled to the, support of the fair., The Navajo Club's part in, the matter was simply to, grasp the opportunity and, crystalize it into action—, that's what the Club was, originated for., Three years ago F. J. Wil, lis, as county fair commis, sioner, advocated the neces, rity for a county fair. So, also has W. J. Flake in his ca, pacity as fair commissioner, saw, the need of a county fair. And, A. P. Larson, as fair commis, sioner, has been very enthusiastic, in advocating a county fair. C., R. Fillerup, as farm advisor, has, advocated county fair. Many of, our leading citizens have advo, cated a fair., A few months ago the Navajo, Club came into existence. It, was organized for the purpose of, bringing together the talents and, energy of men and women. See, ing the opportunity ripe for a, county fair, proposed to get, behind the sentiment and crystal, ize it into action. The fair is, now a live living acting body., When Snowflake boys go after, anything they usually bring it, back, or as said, “fetch home, the bacon.” Lorenzo Jennings, and Seymour Fish went to Mesa, for last Friday night's debate on, the subject: “Resolved, that the, Federal Government should own, and operate the Railroads of the, United States.” Our boys, handled the negative side of the, question and won the debate., Homer F. Bushman was able, to be down town for a short time, Monday and Tuesday while the, sun was warm., The S. S. A. Alumni Associa, tion annual banquet will be held, in this city April 4. A lively, time is anticipated., NAVAUO-APACHE, TEL SYSTEM, %, To Extend Lines South, A few weeks ago this pa, per had something to say, about the local telephone, system, its service, etc., That it pays to advertise,, whether the telephone com, pany we have believes in, advertising or not, is proven, by the news coming from, the telephone company sec, retary and treasurer, Lloyd, C. Henning, to the effect, that the company is prepar, ing to extend its lines and, service from Shumway *to, Showlow, Lakeside, Pinetop, and Cooleys, and that this, work will be started in the, near future., It is very evident that the, Navajo-Apache Telephone, Co. recognize that there is a, bunch of live wires in Snow, flake and that we are not, going to allow this section to, go any longer without first, class telephone service., A telephone system to give, the best service to all con, cerned must serve as many, people as is possible to reach., Right here in Snowflake, some good work can be done, in the way of securing more, telephone subscribers. Too, many of our people depend, upon spending the time in, walking to our stores when, they could have a phone to, use in ordering many of their, wants. The rental is rather, steep, we admit, but the, more subscribers to the ser, vice the cheaper the rent, could be, etc., Mr. Henning writes that, his company will give the, people the best possible ser, vice. This is just what we, are entitled to. In the very, near future our section will, be coupled up with the bal, ance of the world by railway, service and we must have, more telephone territory., It is the policy of this pa, per to boost anything that, has for its purpose the bet, terment of service. We are, very glad to note that in the, very near future additional, communities will be hooked, onto Snowflake and the rest, of us with better telephone, service., The Jen-Dike Theatre has, booked for Saturday night shows, 4-Square service, six reels high, class drama. This service means, that each Saturday night will, present a drama of the same, class as that shown the first night,, “One Hour.” This Saturday, night, “Her Fighting Chance,”, will be shown., Complete Line of Standard, Watches, priced right, at Wetzler, S.

The, Herald has secured some statisti, cal and historical matter concern, ing this great organization and, will give it in our next issue, as, we are short of help and pushed, for time on this issue., L.

Ample proof, has been produced that the entire, proceedings were a deliberate part, of the calculated system of “fright, fulness.”, In France the German system of, forced labor and deportations, with its, horrors, was the same as in Belgium., In this article is shown the real iden, tity of German practice in both occu, pied regions. This can be done from, the official documents and from a sum, mary by Ambassador Gerard. The, harrowing details may be gathered, from the scores of depositions which, accompany the note addressed by the, French government to the governments, of the neutral powers July 25, 1916., These are on file in the state depart, ment, and have also been translated,, along with the official documents, in, “The Deportation of Women and, Girls From Lille.” (New York, Doran.), German Proclamation at Lille., “The attitude of England makes the, provisioning of the population more, and more difficult., “To reduce the misery, the German, authorities have recently asked for, volunteers to go and work in the, country. This offer has not had the, success that was expected., “In consequence of this the inhab, itants will be deported by order and, removed into the country. Persons, deported will be sent to the interior, of the occupied territory in France, far, behind the front, where they will be, employed in agricultural labor, and, not on any military work whatever., By this measure they will be given, the opportunity of providing better, for their subsistence., “In case of necessity, provisions can, be obtained through the German de, pots. Every person deported will be, allowed to take with him 30 kilo, grams of baggage (household utensils,, * clothes, etc.), which it will be well to, make ready at once., “I therefore order that no one, un, til further orders, shall change his, place of residence. No one may ab, sent himself from his declared legal, residence from 9 p. m. to 6 a. m. (Ger, man time), unless he is in possession, of a permit in due form., “Inasmuch as this is an Irrevocable, measure, it is in the interest of the, population itself to remain calm and, obedient., “COMMANDANT., “Lille, April, 1916.”, Notice Distributed in Lille., “All the inhabitants of the houses,, with the exception of children under, fourteen and their mothers, and also, of old people, must prepare themselves, for transportation in an hour and a, half’s time., “An officer will decide definitely, what persons will be taken to the, \'concentration camps. For this pur, pose all the inhabitants of the house, must assemble in front of it; in case, of bad weather they may remain in, the passage. The door of the house, must remain open. All protests will, be useless. No inmate of the house,, even those who are not to be trans, ported, may leave the house before, 8 a. m. (German time)., “Each person will be permitted to, take 30 kilograms of baggage; if any, one’s baggage exceeds that weight, it, will all be rejected, without further, consideration. Packages must be sep, arately made up for each person and, must bear an address legibly w r ritten, and firmly affixed. This address must, contain the surname and the Christian, name and the number of the Identity, card., “It is absolutely necessary that each, person should, In his own interest, pro, vide himself with eating and drink, ing utensils, as well as with a woolen, blanket, good shoes, and body linen., Everyone must carry his identity card, on his person. Anyone attempting to, evade transportation will be punished, without mercy.”, “ETAPPEN-KOMMANDANTUR., (Lille, April, 1916.), Belgian Address to French President., “To Monsieur Raymond Poincare,, President of the French Republic,, Paris., “Sir: We have the honor to ex, press again our most sincere grati, tude to you for your most kind recep, tion, a few days ago, of the deputa, tion which went with feelings of legit, imate emotion to inform you of the, deportation of lads and girls, which, the German authorities have just car, ried out in the invaded districts., “We have collected some details on, the subject from the lips of an honor, able and trustworthy person, who suc, ceeded in leaving Tourcoing about ten, days ago; we think it our duty to, bring these details to your notice by, reproducing textually the declarations, which have been made to us:, * ‘These deportations began towards, Easter. The Germans announced that, the inhabitants of Roubaix, Tourcoing,, Lille, etc., were going to be transport, ed into French districts where their, provisioning would be easier.’, “ ‘At night, at about two o’clock in, the morning, a whole district of the, town was invested by the troops of oc, cupation. To each house was distrib, uted a printed notice, of which we give, herein an exact reproduction, preserv, ing the style and spelling.’ (See docu, ment, above.), “ ‘The inhabitants so warned were to, hold themselves ready to depart an, hour and a half after the distribution, of the proclamation.’, “ ‘Each family, drawn up outside the, house, was examined by an officer, who, pointed out haphazard the persons who, were to go. No words can express the, barbarity of this proceeding nor de, scribe the heartrending scenes which, occurred; young men and girls took, hasty farewell of their parents—a fare, well hurried by the German soldiers, who were executing the infamous task, —rejoined the group of those who were, going, and found themselves in the, middle of the street, surrounded by, other soldiers with fixed bayonets.’, “ ‘Tears of despair on the part of, parents and children so ruthlessly, separated did not soften the hearts of, the brutal Germans. Sometimes, how, ever, a more kind-hearted officer yield, ed to too great despair and did not, choose all the persons whom he should, —by the terms of his instructions —, have separated.’, Herded Like Cattle., “ ‘These girls and lads were taken, in street cars to factories, where they, were numbered and labeled like cattle, and grouped to form convoys. In these, factories, they remained 12, 24 or 36, hours until a train was ready to re, move them.’, “ ‘The deportation began with the, villages of Roney, Halluin, etc., then, Tourcoing and Roubaix. In the towns, the Germans proceeded by districts.’, " ‘ln all about 30,000 persons are said, to have been carried off up to the pres, ent. This monstrous operation has, taken eight to ten days to accomplish., It is feared, unfortunately, that it may, begin again soon., “ ‘The reason given by the German, authorities is a humanitarian (?) one., They have put forward the following, pretexts: provisioning is going to, break down in the large towns in the, north and their suburbs, whereas in, the Ardennes the feeding is easy and, cheap.’, “ ‘lt is known from the young men, and girls, since sent back to their, families for reasons of health, that in, the department of the Ardennes the, victims are lodged in a terrible man, ner, in disgraceful promiscuity; they, are compelled to work in the fields. It, is unnecessary to say that the inhabi, tants of our towns are not trained to, such work. The Germans pay them, 1.50 m. But there are complaints of, insufficient food.’, “Barbarity of Slave Drivers.”, “ ‘They were very badly received in, the Ardennes. The Germans had told, the Ardennais that these were “volun, teers” who were coming to work, and, the Ardennais proceeded to receive, them with many insults, which only, ceased when the forcible deportation, of which they were the victims became, known.’, “ ‘Feeling ran especially high in our, towns. Never has so iniquitous a, measure been carried out. The Ger, mans have shown all the barbarity of, slave drivers.’, “ ‘The families so scattered are in, despair and the morale of the whole, population is gravely affected. Boys, of fourteen, schoolboys in knicker, bockers, young girls of fifteen to six, ten have been carried off, and the de, spairing protests of their parents failed, to touch the hearts of the German offi, cers, or rather executioners.’, “One last detail: ‘The persons so, deported are allowed to write home, once a month; that is to say, even less, often than military prisoners.’, “Such are the declarations which we, have collected and which, without com, mentary, confirm in an even more, striking way the facts which we took, the liberty of laying before you., “We do not wish here to enter into, the question of provisioning in the in, vaded districts; others, better quali, fied than ourselves, give you, as we, know, frequent information. It is, enough for us to describe in a few, words the situation from this aspect:, Entire Population in Misery., “The provisioning is very difficult;, food, apart from that supplied by the, Spanish-American committee, is very, scarce and terribly dear. . . . People, are hungry and the provisioning is in, adequate by at least a half; our popu, lation Is suffering constant privations, and is growing noticeably weaker. The, death rate, too, has increased consid, erably., “Sometimes inhabitants of the in, vaded territories speak with a note of, discouragement, crying apparently:, ‘We are forsaken by everyone.’ We,, on the other hand, are hopeful, Mon, sieur le President, that the energetic, intervention on the part of neutrals,, which the French government is sure, to evoke, will soon bring to an end, these measures which rouse the wrath, of all to whom humanity is not an emp, ty word. . . ., “With all confidence in the sympathy, of the government we venture to ad, dress a new and pressing appeal to, your generous kindness and far-reach, ing influence in the name of those who, are suffering on behalf of the whole, cqjmtry.”, “Paris, 15th June, 1916, 3, rue Tait, bout.”, (Signed on behalf of various speci, fied organizations by Toulemonde,, Charles Droulers, Leon Hatine-Dazin,, and Louis Lorthiois.), S.

It ap, pears that it is another sample, of the Hunt brand of politics., Probably Dr. Blome isn’t an out, and out champion of the I. W. W., Hunt regime. Dr. Blome is the, most popular and valuable mem, ber of the faculty the Normal, has had in its history. Judge, Geo. H. Crosby is at Flagstaff, and is standing by Dr. Blome., The students of the Normal went, out on a strike Monday and re, fuse to return until Dr. Blome is, re-instated. Resolutions were, adopted and approved by the, entire studeut body condeming, the attempt to remove Dr Blome., It has been said that Dr. Blome, was un-patriotic. This is abso, lutely false. He has two sons in, the service, one a lieutenant., Since the United States has been, at war with Germany Dr. Blome, has been squarely behind the, government and absolutely true, to the principles for which our, country has pledged every drop, of American blood., This paper is just in receipt of, the news of the trouble, and as, we go to press the set of resolu, tions and a phone message from, Judge Crosby was received.

Being, unsuccessful, Heaton calls in the, district Revenue Officer, Jack, Hale. Through a spy, the Tol, liver clan, who are the moon, shiners, hear that Hale has, arrived to help Heaton in his, investigation. June Tolliver, the, beautiful daughter of old Judd, Tolliver, the head of the clan,, pretends to have a sprained ankle, at the foot of the big. Lonesome, Pine and wheh Hale comes along,, he carries her to the cabin and, is captured by the moonshiners., Knowing that they will have to, work fast to get their illegal, whiskey out of the country, old, Judd Tolliver leaves Dave, his, nephew, who is also in love with, June, to guard Hale, while the, rest of the gang rush the whiskey, to the railroad., The increasing friendliness, between June and Hale arouses, Dave’s jealousy and he forces, Hale to live in the cowshed., Hale sets the straw in the shed, on fire and escapes. Hale gets, back to town and with a posse, starts for an old deserted shack, where he thinks the illegal, whiskey is hidden and where he, expects to arrest the gang of, moonshiners. The posse sur, round the cabin and upon break, ing into it after a sharp fight,, find only June. The remainder, of the gang escape thru an un, derground passageway., Hale sends a note to Heaton,, saying that he will take his posse, and look for the escaped moon, shiners along the South trail and, for Heaton and his posse to go, along the North trail. There is, an understanding between Hale, and Heaton that the order of all, notes be reversed. A spy is sent, to deliver the note to Heaton, and he pauses long enough to, show its contents to the Tollivers, None of them can read except, June and she, wishing to protect, her sweetheart, reverses the, directions so that instead of, sending the moonshiners to meet, Heaton, she throws them directly, in Hale’s path, which was directly, opposite to what she intened to do, Hale is met and riddled with, bullets by the moonshiners. June, pleads with her stern father to, do something to save Hale’s life., This Judd refuses to do even, though she confesses her love for, the Revenue Officer. June in, duces Dave to ride for a doctor., Dave meets the posse in charge, of Heaton and learns that he has, medical experience. He then, tells Heaton where Hale is and, the posse surround the cabin and, by force of numbers induce the, moonshiners to surrender. The, old man discovers that Dave has, been a traitor and shoots him., Hale rapidly recovers under, June\'s nursing. He begs June, to marry him but she says she, cannot leave her father who has, nothing left but her. Hale pleads, in vain and starts down the trail, alone. Old Judd has seen that, June is sacrificing everything to, be loyal to hin and calls Hale, THE SNOWFLAKE HERALD., Washington, March 19:—For, est fires burned over 962,000 acres, of National Forest lands in 1917, and caused a loss of $1,358,600, to the Government in timber’, forage, and young growth, ac, cording to figures complied by, the Forest Service. While the, loss was larger than for several, years past, officials say that, con, sidering the unusually dangerous, conditions, it was remarkably, light. Protracted drouth and, periods of high winds made the, conditions, they declare, virtually, the same as in 1910, when many, persons were burned to death, and 25 million dollars worth of, timber on the National Forests, was destroyed., In addition to the actual loss, in timber and forage, the fires of, last year entailed extra expendi, tures by the Government of sl,-, 121,451. This, it is pointed out,, means that to hold the fires, down large numbers of men have, to be withdrawn from productive, work and much money spent for, supplies. At a time like the, present when it is necessary to, practice the utmost economy as, a war duty, the Forest Service, officials are emphasizing the, criminal wastefullness of forest, fires that can be prevented from, starting., Os the 7,814 fires which were, fought on the National Forests,, all but 2,132 set by lightning, were caused by human agencies, and could have been prevented., There were 952 incendiarv fires,, whcih occurred for the most part, in Oregon, California and Arkan, sas. Careless campers were re, sponsible for 1,288. Railroads,, partly through failure to comply, with the law and use proper, spark arresters, set 1,003. The, remainder were caused by vari, ous forms of carelessness on the, part of settlers and other users, of the National Forests., Effort is being made by the, Forest Service to impress upon, the public the necessity of keep, ing fire out of the woods, especi, ally now that the country needs, ics man-power so badly for other, purposes than fighting unneces, sary fires. The campaign of, education against carelessness, and indifference which has been, waged for years, through fire, warnings, posters, talks, and, lectures, “movies,” and in other, ways, it is asserted, will there, fore be pressed with renewed, energy the coming season., ‘‘The Trail of the Lonesome, Pine,” a play that has entertain, ed all nations of the earth and is, still as popular as ever, will be, staged at the Jen-Dike Theatre, March 28.
