The entire police and\ndetective force of the city and half\na hundred men employed by Mr. Cud\nahy have been scouring the city and\ncountry throughout the day in hope\nof locating the young man or securing\na clue which would lead to a knowl\nedge of his whereabouts, without suc\ncess.\nBusiness at Mr. Cudahy\'s packing\nplant in South Omaha was practically\nsuspended today, nearly the entire\nforce there joining in the search. The\nboy\'s parents are distracted at his\ndisappearance and the father has of\nfered to pay a substantial reward and\nask no questions if his son is returned\nto his home. An anonymous letter has\nbeen received at the Cudahy home\nsubstantiating the fears of the family\nthat he has been\'kidnapped.\nYoung Cudahy left home at 8 o\'clock\nlast night to take some books to the\nresidence of Captain Rustin, about\ntwo blocks distant and that was the\nlast seen of him. Midnight came and\nas he did not return the police were\nnotified and two detectives were de\ntailed to work on the case.\nOmaha, Dec. 21. — Twenty-live\nthousand dollars in gold was the price\npaid by Edward A. Cudahy, the mil\nlionaire packer, for the return of his\nson, Edward A. Cudahy, Jr., who was\nabducted by a gang of kidnappers last\nTuesday night.\nYesterday about noon and several\nhours after the letter had been left\nin the front yard at the Cudahy resi\ndence another missive was delivered\nto Mr. Cudahy at his residence. It\ncame through the mails and contained\na propositon to return the boy safe\nand unharmed, provided the sum of\n$25,000 was paid that night. In the\nletter were full directions as to where\nthe money was to be left and the as\nsurance was given that the missing\nboy would be allowed to return home\nwithin a few hours after the time the\ncash was received.\nA consultation was had at once and\nthe matter gone over in detail. Plans\nwere fixed for capturing the bandits\nwhen they should make their appear\nance at the rendezvous, but one after\nanother they were dropped as being\nimpracticable. Finally, impelled by\nthe strain under which the entire\nhousehold was laboring, Mr. Cudahy\ndecided to comply with the terms of\nfered and recover his son. The money,\nsecured by a trusted messenger who\nwas sworn to secrecy, was brought\nto the Cudahy residence. It was all in\ngold. After dinner Mr. Cudahy had\nhad his horse harnessed to light\nbuggy, and, taking the money in it\nwith him, left for the designated\nplace. In his buggy ne carried\nred lantern and was quite alone.\nLeaving the house he drove five miles\nwest of town on the Sherman avenue\nroad until he came to a white lantern\nthat was hanging on a short stick by\nthe side of the road. This was the\nplace where the ransom was to be\nleft and he alighted from his buggy.\nHe deposited the money close to the\nstick bearing the white light. Then,\nwithout seeing any one he returned\nhome.\nIn the meantime the captors of the\nboy had seen the red light coming up\nthe road and as soon as the buggy\nhad disappeared again in the direc\ntion from which it had come, they\nvisited the spot, took away the money\nand prepared to keep faith with the\nfather and the boy. The lad was\nbundled Into a hack and set down\nclose by his father\'s house about 1\no\'clock this morning. Where he had\nbeen he could not say, but as near as\nhe could estimate he thought he had\nbeen taken about five miles south of\nOmaha.\nThe cunning of the gang who had\nthe boy in keeping and their thorough\nknowledge of the geography of the\ncity are evidenced in the plans they\nlaid. Close by the place where Mr.\nCudahy was directed to leave the ran\nsom for his son the river approaches\nthe road, and it is supposed that the\nmen were on the watch for the mil\nlionaire and saw his red light from a\nboat. As soon as he had driven\naway and they had satisfied them\nselves that no others were lurking\nnear, they probably clambered up the\nbank, obtained the sack of gold that\nhad been left for them, made their\nway to the boat again and escaped\nwithout leaving any tell tale foot\nprints\nThis afternoon, absolutely no clue\nto the identy of the men who\nspirited the boy away had been found,\nthough the police have been working\nincessantly on the matter ever since\nit was first reported. Whether he will\nbe able to give the police any inform\nation that will lead to the capture\nof the outlaws who held him prisoner\nover 24 hours remains to be seen.\nThe boy says that he was seized\non the street by two men who tol.l\nhim that he was a fugitive from the\nreform school and that they were dep\nuty sheriffs from another county.\nThey placed him in a closed carriage\nand threw a baby skirt over his head.\nThey took him, according to his best\nrecollections, to a lonely cabin west\nof South Omaha, there kept him a\nprisoner until put in a hack and re\nturned io his home this morning. At\nthe cottage he was guarded by two\nmen and provided with sufficient food.\nLater.\nOmaha, Dec. 21.—The result of 24\nhours\' work of the police of this city\nand half a hundred detectives has\nbrought to light the location of the\nhouse in which Edward Cudahy, Jr.,\nwas held a prisoner for nearly two\ndays, before he was returned to his\nhome in the city at a late hour Wed\nnesday night. It is stated this morn\ning that Pat Crowe, well known to\nlocal police circles is the man whom\nthe police suspect of being the leader\nof the gang who abducted young Ed\nward Cudahy, on Tuesday night. The\nofficers in citizen clothing are looking\nl\'or Crowe today, but so far he has not\nbeen arrested. The police and de\ntectives who are working on the mat\nter are inclined to believe that men\nnot well acquainted with the city and\nsurrounding country would not have\nbeen .able to manage the affair, as It\nwas carried out. For this reason\nthey are searching for several local\nmen who are know to bear hard\nreputations and an extra force of\nPinkertons arrived this morning, and\nwere put to work on the case. The\nonly clue they have to work on at\npresent is a copy of the letter thrown\non the Cudahy\'s lawn naming what\nhour the boy would be returned. The\noriginal copy was returned with the\nmoney, this being one of the consid\nerations demanded by the despera\ndoes. Mr. Cudahy this morning con\nfirmed the offer of a reward of $25,\n000, for the arrest of the abductor3.\nYoung Edward Cudahy today stated\nthat the letter was hurled into the\nyard by his abductors before they left\nthe neighborhod of his home. That\nwas Tuesday, December 18. This\nhas given rise to some curious spec\nulation, for the letter was dated De\ncember 19, that is to say the following\nday. It was Wednesday morning\nthat the letter was found in the front\nyard. If the bandits wrote the letter\nand threw it into the yard Tuesday\nnight, they dated it ahead. The let\nter w r as unsigned\' and the statement\nthat was made shortly after its dis\ncovery, that it was signed "Jack," was\nan error.\na\na\na\nA New York man spanked his wife\nin order to spite his mother-in-law.\nSKULL HORRIBLY CRUSHED.\nGreat Falls Laborer Caught In Eleva\'\ntor — Is Injured Fatally.\nGreat Falls, Dec. 21.—Nicholas An\ntonich, an Austrian laborer, employed\nat the Boston & Montana Smelter,\ndied this afternoon, at Columbus hos\npital from injuries received while op\nerating an elevator at the works early\nthis morning. The elevator on which\nthe accident occurred Is one of the\ntwo which operate on the balance\nprinciple and convey coke from the\nbins to the blast furnace above. They\nare started by means of a cable on\nthe west side of the shaft. The ele\nvator which Antonich was about to\nuse was on the east side, and after\npulling the rope he was a little late\nin reaching the cage and was in the\nact of climbing aboard when his head\nbecame caught between the cage and\nthe beams of the shaft. His skull\nwas crushed in a horrible manner and\nthe end of his jaw bone was driven\nin to the base of the brain, the in\njured man then fell to the bottom of\nthe shaft.\nINJURED BY\nAN EXPLOSION\nThe Old Story of Dynamite in\nthe Stove.\nFORBIS AND LONG\nResign Their Positions as Trustees of the\nState School of Mines — Don\'t\nLike Board\'s Action.\nButte, Dec. 21.—Dynamite exploded\nin a cabin near Bernice tonight and\ntwo Finlanders, who occupied it were\nbadly injured. The dynamite was in\na stove and the men were made a\ntarget for a shower of iron that struck\nnearly every portion of their bodies.\nThe men left Butte some days ago to\nprospect for themselves, and for\nButte parties. They took possession\nof a cabin about four and and half\nmiles south and west of Bernice. It\nhad not been occupied for a year and\na half. It was in good condition,\nhowever, and there w r as a stove in it.\nTonight for the first time they light\ned a fire in the stove in order to\ncook their supper. Almost the mo\nment the light was touched to the\nwood there was an explosion and the\nmen were blown out of the building.\nOne of the men who managed to say\nthat his name was Leander Michael,\nwho was not so badly injured as his\ncompanion and soon recevered con\nsciousness, crawled on his hands and\nknees over the hard ground and\nthrough the freezing air for half a\nmile to the county road, which leads\nto the Lockhart ranch. He was un\nable to continue and feeling that he\nwould be frozen to death, he shouted\na sloudly as he could for help. He\nshouted for probably half an hour\nbefore his cries were heard, then\nWilliam Holmes, Charles Hoadley and\nseveral other men who live in a\ncabin half a mile from where Michael\nlay came to his assistance. Holmes\ncarried him to his cabin, w\'hile his\ncompanions went to the relief of the\nother man, who was also taken to\nHolmes\' cabin. There the men were\nmade as comfortable as possible and\nafter a short time were taken to this\ncity in a wagon and left at the sis\nters hospital.\n000\nda\nW.\nby\nthe\nof\nas\nore\nhut\nthe\nred\nthe\nthe\nButte, Dec. 21.—Two of the trus\ntees of the School of Mines, James\nForbis and Joseph Long, have dis\npatched their resignations to the state\nboard of education and asked to be\nrelieved of their duty, at once. This\naction is in pursuance or repeated\nstatements made by these two gen\ntlemen who declared that the re\ncent proceedings of the state board\nof education was a direct reflection\non their judgment in conducting the\naffairs of the school. The resigna\ntions were directed to the state board\nof education and sent by mail to Gov\nernor R. B. Smith, who is ex-officio\npresident of the board and had charge\nof the work of the construction of\nthe building, they were then made\ntrustees of the school with the usual\nduties of trustees in carrying on the\nschool. They say they used their\nbest judgment demanded by the needs\nof the school and have said, in force\nable terms, that if the board of edu\ncation don\'t like their way of doing\nbusiness it can get somebody else.\nDAMAGE SUIT DISMISSED.\nWith the Understanding That Eithe\nSide Pay Its Own Costs.\nButte, Dec. 21.—Upon the opening\nof Judge Lindsey\'s court this morning\nC. H. Connolly, on of the attorneys\nrepresenting the plaintiff in the case\ndismissed, the $100,000 damage suit\nof Fred Whiteside against the Butte\nMiner, W. A. Clark and others. The\nsuit was dismissed with the under\nstanding that either side should pay\nits own costs, which indicated some\nunderstanding between the parties.\nThe action was the result of some\nwhat violent newspaper attacks on\nMr. Whiteside after his disclosure of\nthe bribery of the legislature In Hel\nena two years ago. The suit was dis\nmissed without jurisdiction.\nan\nto\ndo\nit\nRatified Treaty.\nWashington, Dec. 20.—The Hay\nPauncefote treaty as amended, was\nratified by the senate today The vote\nwas 55 to 18.\nEx-Governor Wolcott Dead.\nBoston, Dec. 21.—Former Governo.\'\nWolcott died at 3:40 this afternoon.\na\nty,\nan\n1\nSUIT FOR A MILLION.\nBrought Against Clark and the Colu\nsa Parrot Mininf Company.\nButte, Dec. 21.—A [suit l\'or $1,075,\n000 has been brougm in the United\nStates court in Butt* by the Anacon\nda Copper Mining company against\nW.

Evidently the manage\nment knew the temper of the audi\nence, and felt that even under such\ncircumstances the British flag would\nnot be a good thing, so what did they\ndo but give Richard the Star Span\ngled Banner, and, by ail tile gods, he\ntook it with him in the charge and\nplanted it on Acre\'s walls. It was\nridiculous, of course, and we English\nmen laughed, but the audience took\nit quite as the correct thing, and the\nway the people stormed and shouted\nand clapped was enough to have\nmade Richard turn over in his grave.\nHistorically it was away off, dramati\ncally it was open to criticism, but pa\ntriotically it was a howling success.\nThe Fatal Apple Blossoms.\n"I saw in the Star not long ago,\ncopied from a New York paper," said\na lady living near Greeley, Pike coun\nty, Pa., "a story about an apple tree\nblossoming in October, and the fatal\nresults of it. The story was told as\ncoming from a man. and he said that\nan apple tree at his home had blos\nsomed some ten years before in Oct\ntober, and shortly afterwards his wife\nhad died. It had not blossomed\nagain in October for several years,\nand then within a month his mother\nhad died. Then, there was another\nlapse, and when lie told the story,\nwhich was about the first of October,\nthe tree was again in blossom and\nhe was greatly disturbed as to what\nwas going to happen next. Well,\nthat story was mine and the reporter\nput it in the name of a man because\n1 didn\'t want to appear In it. Two\nweeks after I had told the story to a\nparty of friends, in which the report\ner was, 1 went back home, and with\nin a week the house took fire and\nburned to the ground. It was so\nsudden that we barely managen to\nget out with our lives, and our chief\narticles of apparel were bath robes\nand blankets. it v. ;. a country place\nand we had no means of putting out\nthe fire, so everything was losL The\nonly consolation we have is that the\nfatal apple tree stood so close to the\nhouse that it was burned to a crisp,\nand it, at least, will never again be\nthe messenger of bad luck, however\nmuch other trees may bring with\ntheir October blossoms. One thing I\nam sure of, I was never superstitious\nbefore, but I confess to a little of it\nnow, and I never want to see another\napple tree blooming in October if it\nbelongs to me."\nTELEGRAPHERS\'\nSTRIKE IS OFF\nOperators Now Have Permis\nsion to Look For Work.\nMUST SECURE OFFICES\nBefore General Manager Mudge Will Talk\nto Those on Strike -Company\nSeems to Have Won.\nTopeka, Kansas, Dec. 21.—Presi\ndent Dolphin, of the Order of Railroad\nTelegraphers has declared the strike\nof the operators on the Santa Fe off.\nAll striking operators received orders\ntonight from President Dolphin that\nthe strike would continue no longer,\nand the operators are beginning to\nspeculate as to whether they will be\nreinstated in the employment of the\ncompany.

So far as this recommenda\ntion concerns timber or grazing lands\nit is perhaps all right but as it affects\nagriculural lands suitable for homes,\na more vicious or pernicious system\ncould not be devised. History nas\ndemonstrated that the strongest gov\nernment is possible only where the\ncitizens own their own homes, while\na nation of tenants is a nation of un\nrest. England and Ireland are re\nspective examples of these two types\nand Mr. Moore need go no further\nthan Flathead county to see the ill\neffects of his pet system. Large\ntracts of land belonging to the state\nare occupied by tenants in this coun\nty, and if he will take a drive across\nthis valley he will need no guide to\npoint out the state lands, for while\nthe lands owned by settlers are mark\ned by comfortable homes and good\nfences, the state lands are adorned\nby miserable shacks, straw barns and\ntemporary fences, for no man cares to\nput valuable improvements upon land\nbelonging to another. These lands\nrent well at this time because of their\nvirgin fertility, but as every tenant\ntakes as much as possible from the\nland with the smallest possible ex\npenditure, the lands will soon become\nexhausted and of little or no rental\nvalue. While the land reserves go\nmostly to support educational institu\n. ons of the state, the people of this\ncounty are compelled to carry the\nheavy end of the burden, while the\npeople of cue populous districts re\nceive nearly all the benefits while\ncarrying none of the burdens of taxa\ntion.\nThe people who own their homes\nin this county must support the local\nschools to educate several hundred\nchildren whose parents reside upon\nstate lands; likewise they must pay\ntaxes to build and maintain roads\nand bridges through the two hundred\nthousand acres of state lands in this\ncounty; they must maintain the coun\nty governments and courts used by\nthe people living upon state lands,\nfor the state lands pay no taxes what\never.\nNearly all the people residing upon\nstate lands in this county have been\ndesirious of purchasing their hold\nings, but under the policy pursued by\nthe present state land officials they\nhave been unable to do so. It seems\ncertain that an effort will be made\nat the next session of the legislature\nto permanently withdraw all state\nlands from sale and the taxpayers of\nthis county should make an effort to\nprevent the enactment of such a law.\nA JOURNALISTIC BULLY.\nHaving signally failed to earn the\nboodle distributed among them dur\ning the campaign, as the election\nclearly proved, the rural standard oil\npress are now training their pop-guns\non the Herald.—Helena Herald.\nEditor Keith seems to be unable to\ndisabuse his mind of the idea that any\npublication with which he happens to\nbe connected is necessarily a piece of\nheavy journalistic ordnance and that\nall newspapers published outside of\nHelena are journalistic "pop-guns."\nHe seems to have the idea that if\nhe writes 24 columns of editorials in\na week and has them printed at the\nrate of four columns a day in the\nHerald, he is necessarily entitled to\nmore consideration than the rural ed\nitor who writes not more than four\ncolumns a week. It seems to be\nquantity rather than quality that\ncounts with Keith, and on that basis\na\nIt\nIt\nof\nto\nof\nin\nhis contemptuous reference to the\n"rural pop-guns" is perhaps justified.\nBut two sticks of common sense in\na country weekly will receive more\nconsideration from thoughtful people\nthan six columns of redundant bom\nbast in the Helena Herald.\nThis is not saying that Editor\nKeith\'s editorials are too abund\nant to be uniformly good, but\nit is saying that he has no\nwarrant for his high and lofty\ndisdain of the country press, regard\nless of politics. The assumption of\nsuperiority on the part of Editor\nKeith ill becomes him. If lie is so\nsmall that he cannot afford to be\nmodest and unassuming he certainly\nis not so big that he can afford to be\nconceited and supercilious with his\nrural contemporaries.\nCHRISTMAS EDITIONS.\nThe Christmas Standard was issued\nlast Sunday. It contained sixty-eight\npages, each page artistic and the ad\nmiration of everyone. The reading\nmatter of each feature treated was\nof the usual high class found in Mon\ntana\'s favorite newspaper.\nThe makeup, the beautiful halftones\nand special pages mark this as the\nbest by far of any of the special is\nsues of this section. It is probable\nthat the Christmas Standard is the\nmost expensive of any issue of a\nnewspaper in the mountain states,\nand by the same token, the ad\nverisers in that number must pay\nthree times as much money as paid\nto any three special issues of any\nother Montana daily.\nAnother Christmas issue of last\nSunday was the Great Falls Tribune.\nIt was made up of .wenty-eiglit pages\nfilled with interesting reading and\nvery neat typographically, the first\nand second sections being in colors.\nIt is not so very loug ago since the\nTribune was a small paper, but it\nhas grown rapidly, especially the past\nyear, and seems to fit in the large\nfield surrounding Great Falls in a way\nthat must suit the people and the\nTribune as well.\nMERE TRIFLES.\nBut They Have Led the Way to Some\nSurprising Results.\nFrom the Cincinnati Enquirer:\nBecause a man forgot to close his\nwindow tlie state of Massachusetts\nhas lost $:i,000.*»00, and is stiil losing\n$500,000 a year. The man was a silk\ngrower. He sent to France for some\ngypsy moths, which lie intended to\nexperiment with a view to a new\nbrand of silk. One day he sat at his\ntable examing some of these moths,\nwhen he was called out of the room.\nHe left the window open and the\ndraught blew the moths out. Two\nyears later caterpillars ate the leaves\noff of every forest and fruit tree for\nmiles around. They were the gypsy\nmoths, and the state has spent over\n$1,000,009 in fighting the pests.\nTwo gunboats sent up the Nile\nsome years ago caused one of\nthe worst famines known in lower\nEgypt. The gunboats went up into\nthe marshes beyond Khartoum to\nhunt slave traders. The slavers, in\ntheir anxiety to get away cut chan\nnels through the "sudd" and the mass\nof vegetation which lines the main\nstream of the river. The result was\nthat the current carried down these\nfloating stalks, and dammed itself so\ncompletely that the Nile flood failed,\nand thousands of the peasantry lost\ntheir crops and almost starved.\nA Swiss tradesman eating sausages\nfor supper saved a policeman recently\nfrom eight years\' penal servitude.\nThe policeman shot a man who re\nfused to follow him to the station.\nFor this he was tried and sentenced\nto twelve years\' servitude. His law\nyer objected on the ground that, one\nof the jurymen had been asleep dur\ning the trial. The objection held\ngood, and at a i;ew trial the police\nman\'s sentence was reduced to four\nyears. The reason the juryman\nslept that afternoon was that his sup\nper had disagreed with him, and, con\nsequently he was unable to get\nsleep at night.\nGermany, which never had a finger\nin the Spanish-American war, is the\nbiggest gainer by it.

Vessel men say that\nthis would be a bad move, for in case\nof accident in the American canal\nthere would be a blockade. They\nsay that they will use the Canadian\npassage more in future that it may\nbe maintained.\nThings Heard and Seen.\n"The marrieage license book is al\nways an interesting study," said an\nassistant clerk of the courts yester\nday at the city hall. "Especially is\nthis true just now." he continued.\n"For some reason or other there is\nau impression which conies to those\ncontemplating matrimony during the\nfall season that unusual good fortune\nwill follow the tying of the nuptial\nknot on Thanksgiving Day. Supersti\ntion in a mild form seems to cling to\nthe American people, and the best\nplace to find that this is so is behind\nthe counter where applications are\nmade for marriege permits. The day\nbefore last Thanksgiving, for instance\nthere were issued fifty-one licenses.\nThere was a constant line at the desk\nthroughout the day, and l don\'t be\nlieve there were five applicants who\ncame for the unlicense unaccompan\nied . The bride groom-elect seems to\nthink that in securing a license he\nmust undergo a trying ordeal and the\nchances are that his friend will have\nto speak first and state what is want\ned It is hardly necessary for either\none to announce the fact, however,\nfor we are able to pick the license\nseeker almost every time.\n"October seems to be the most pop\nular month for marrying nowadays.\nIt has even outstripped June the long\nfamed month el\' weddings But no\nmatter how busy the season the mar\nriage book always enjoys a rest Fri\ndays. It is seldom, indeed, that more\nthan one or two licenses are issued\non that day of supposed ill-luck.\n"But returning to Thanksgiving, it\nis a pretty study to figure how many\nof those fifty-one couples will be as\nthankiul one year from that day. At\nthe city hall there is hardly any dis\ntance from the marriage license desk\nto the counter where divorce suits are\nhandled \\Ye witness the beginning\nand the end of many marriages."\n"Although steel wooi has only been\nused as a substitute for sandpaper\nduring the la t six years, it is now\nvery extensively utilized for polish\ning purposes by metal workers car\npenters, eabim tmakers, house-paint\ners sign painters and grainers through\nout the United States," said a whole\nsale dealer in the material to a writ\ner recently "Steel wool is an arti\ncle of regular manufacture and is put\nup in one-pound packages very much\nresembling rolls of cotton batting. It\nis composed of sharp-edged threads\nof steel, which curl up like wool or\nthe familiar wood uoer known as ex\ncelsior, hut it is much finer in texture\nthan the latter material, the finest\nquality being not much coarser than\nthe coarsest of natural wools\n"The superiority of the steel wool\nover Hie ordinary sandpaper consists\nin its great pliability, which enables\na worker to polish or smooth down ir\nregular parts of molding or ornamen\ntal woodwork. Such work can be\ndone with steel wool far better and\nmuch more expeditiously than with\nsandpaper. The latter clogs in use,\nbut steel wool always retains a more\nperfect polishing edge or surface. The\nwool is made in various degrees of\ncoarseness the coarser grade being\nbest adapted for taking off old paint\nor varnish and for smoothing and\ncleaning floors like those of bowling\nalleys. The wool is generally used\nwith gloves to keep the sharp ends\nfrom sticking into the workman\'s\nfingers.\nOne of the most delighted visitors\nto the 1\'aris exposition the past sea\nson was a young woman who the most\nof her life had been and still is an\noperator on a button machine in a\nWashington shirt factory. When in\nher teens the- ambition of her life was\nto be able to see with her own eyes\nthe many attractions of Europe but\nthe- family was oarely iu moderate\ncircumstances, and the European trip\nwas to her but a dream .apparently\nnever to be realized. Nevertheless,\nwhen her school days were over and\nslu> went into the shirt factory her\nfancy of walking in the old galleries\nof art. climbing the Alps and steam\ning down the Rhine operated to re\nlieve 1 the monotony of her work. At\nlast an opportunity came; a relative\ndied, and among the bequests in the\nwill was one of about three thousand\ndollars to the poor buttonhole worker.\nTHE POPULAR FLOUR\nREX\nALWAYS UNIFORM IN QUALITY\nBARGAINS\nFUR OVERCOATS\nNATHAN BROS.\nAnd ere the money was paid her she\nhad considered what disposition she\nshould make of it. Three thousand\ndollars invested at (1 per cent would\nyield but $15 per month barely enough\nfor board. She was hearty and strong\nher work was agreeable and yielded\nmuch more than four dollars a week.\nShe had no r. qionsibilities and as\nlong as she had health and there were\nbuttonhole machines she could make\nher living. Then why not gratify\nlier long-cherished ambition by mak\ning a tour of Europe as a lady when\nshe had the chance, which might\nnever come again It was not long\nafter receiving the money before she\nwas eriroute to Europe on a flyer and\nit is needless to say that the tour\nshe made was greatly enjoyed. It\nwas not terminated till barely enough\nof the legacy was left to enable her\nto reach home. After a few days-\'\nrest attired in the latest Parisian style\nand with a head so stored with the\nmemories of her wonderful trip, she\nreturned to her factory and arranged\nto resume her work It may well be\nimagined that in the work room she\nregales proudly her companions with\naccounts of her wonderful experience\nin the old world. When the sugges\ntion is made that she should have\nkept her legacy she asserts with\nwarmth that it was hers to use as she\nchose and it paid her to experience\nthe life of a lady traveler even but\nfor n few months.\nEXTRADITION WITH ENGLAND.\nTreaty Concluded Amending the Ex\nisting Treaty.\nA treaty has been concluded be\ntween the United States and Great\nBritain amendatory of the existing ex\ntradition treaty and intended to cor\nrect certain imperfections in that in\nstrument developed by recent experi\nence. The changes do not material\nly affect the scope or principles of\nthe existing treaty, the chief item in\nthe list being a provision classifying\nas a crime, subject to extradition, the\nobtaining of money under false pre\ntenses.\nAt present the treaty makes extra\nditionable the reception of money ob\ntained under false pretenses, and om\nission of the principal in the crime\nconstituting a manifest absurdity, the\namendments made.\nGENERAL WILSON\'S CASE.\nAn Effort Being Made to Have Him\nRetired as Brigadier General.\nBrigadier General James H.

They were\nseen around the building where the\nrobbery occurred, had no funds be\nfore it, but were uush afterwards and\nwhen arrested both had a consider\nable amount of money of the denom\ninations of that stolen, one having\nseveral dollars in dimes and both\nhaving many one and two dollar bills.\nAt the conclusion of the arraign\nment ustice Billings announced that\nhe would hind them over to await\ntrial by the district court and fixed\ntheir bail at $500, which they were\nunable to furnish.

CANNON, ONE PRICE CLOTHIER', 'UNITED DAIRYING INTERESTS.\nWhat the Passage of the Grout BMI\nHas Demonstrated.\n"The passage of the Grout or oleo\nmarmargarine bill through congress\nby so decisive a majority was the\ngreatest victory the farmers of this\ncountry ever accomplished and dem\nonstrates what a terrific power politi\ncally combined rural communities\nwould possess if they could but ef\nfect a proper combination," said J.\nW. Foster, a farmer from central\nNew York, to a Star reporter in one\nof the down town hotels this morn\ning.\n"If the constituents of a member or\na prospective member of congress\nfrom a rural district were to let him\nknow that if he voted against their\ninterests on any matter of legislation\ncoming up during his term he would\nbe promptly retired at its close and\nanother man substituted who would\ntake the wishes and the interests of\nhis constituency first into considera\ntion and his personal inclinations\nafterward, general sentmont in con\ngress would undergo a change.\n"On the stump a candidate for of\nfice will and does promise andything.\nHe talks at length of the interests of\nhis constituents being first in his\nheart. It is only when he gets to\ncongress that they hear anything\nabout his \'personal convictions.\'\nFarmers, as a rule, are an easy-going\nclass of voters, but they were ail\nworked up over the oleomargarine\nbill this year. Scores of members\ncame back with the positive assur\nance that it would be their last term\nif they failed to give their constitu\nencies the protection they demanded,\nand so urgently needed. I, myself,\npersonally informed my member that\nif he did not vote for the one great\nbill which the farmers and dairymen\nof this country demanded should be\npassed 1 would use my strongest en\ndeavors to beat him at the primaries\nand failing to accomplish that, that I\nwould take my horse and buggy and\ncampaign against him on the stump,\nlose my time and spend my money\nto defeat him; and, furthermore, that\nI would guarantee to enlist at least\none dozen representative farmers in\nmy township who would do the same\nthing. He assured me that his prom\nise to vote for the bill was no anti\nelection promise, and so it proved.\n"The great trouble with the farmer\nvote in acting in unison is that it is\nso scattered that combinations can\nnot be readily effected, as in other\noccuptions, skilled labor, for instance.\nThe labor unions in a member\'s dis\ntrict can, as a rule, control his vote\non all questions affecting their par\nticular trade. The farmers of his\ndistrict might outnumber the member\nship of the unions ten to one, but,\nbeing ununited, the member gives\nsecondary thought to their demands.\n"If farmers would cultivate the let\nter writing habit to the extent prac\nticed by the constituencies of the\ncity members and drop their repre\nsentatives from time to time little\nnotes, it would go a great way toward\nperfecting a sort of organization\namong them, and that is about the\nonly effective way it can be done.\n"An analysis of the vote on the\nGrout bill is interesting. It shows,\nbriefly, that the negative vote came\nlargely from the members represent\ning city and manufacturing constitu\nencies and from the southern mem\nbers, though many from my section\nvoted for it. Inasmuch as the south\nis essentially an agricultural coun\ntry it would at first be supposed that\nthe vote of its members would have\nbeen unanimous in favor of the bill.\nThe division and strong vote against\nthe bill arises from the fact that the\ndairying interests in the south are\nyet in their infancy, and the pressure\nfrom that quarter was necessarily\nless than from the west and east. The\nfarmers are mightily pleased over the\nresult, and the members from the ag\nricultural districts who voted for the\nbill will receive their warm congratu\nlations and in most instances undoubt\nedly a renomination.\nThe Lottery of Racing.\n"Only a flathead or a village idiot\nwill play horse combinations," dryly\nremarked an old-time trainer out at\nBenning the other afternoon, when the\nsubject of beating a whole day\'s race\ncard came up. "Horse combinations\nwould break Rockefeller if he stayed\nwith them long enough. Oh, yes, I\nknow that combination tickets go\nthrough once in a while. So does a\nland crab beat a stake horse once in\na while. But the occasional combin\nation ticket that goes through is the\nexception that proves the rule. I knew\na young fellow who worked in an in\nsurance office who one day picked\nthe whole card at Monmouth Park on\na combination ticket that paid $3,000\nto the 910 . On the following day he\nput the whole bunch—he wouldn\'t\nspent one cent of it for haberdashery\n—or anything else—on a two-horse\ncombination, both horses to win. One\nof them was a western horse that\nwas chalked upon the blackboard at\n4 to 5 to win, and the other waB a\npretty fairish sort of a race horse—\noh, well, just about one of the great\nest that ever lived, that\'s , all— called\nat\nI\na\nin\nat\na\nHanover. Perhaps you\'ll just recall\na line or two about Hanover.\n"The pool rooms held Hanover, at\n1 to 15, to win the Omnibus stakes.!\nIt didn\'t seem as if there was any\nthing to beat that race. Mike Dwyer,\nthe plunger, put down $43,000 to win\n$3,000 on Hanover, at the Monmouth\nPark track. Well, this young fel\nlow\'s combination looked like the real\nmerchandise when the western horse\nwon his race in a walk. He\'d got\neven money—$3,000 to $3.000—on the\ncombination, and the proprietor of\nthe pool room offered to buy the tick\net for $5,000 two minutes before the\nhorses went to the post at Monmouth\nPark.\n" \'Not for $5,999.99,\' replied the\nyoung fellow. \'You can buy two\nwhole unsmoked cigarettes for a cent,\nand I might as well have the penny\nas you.\'\n" \'Son,\' an old-timer in the room\nsaid to the youth, \'you\'re a bit shy on\nlevel-headedness in this matter. Take\nmy advice and accept the $5,000 for\nthat piece of pasteboard. You can\nhave a heap of fun with yourself on\n$5,000. And $5,000 in hand is a heap\nbetter than framing that ticket to\nlook at in your hall bed room, as it\'s\njust possible you may have to do—for\nhorses have been stood on their heads\nat shorter prices even than 1 to 15\nsince the beginning of the merry-go\nround game.\'\n" I know all that,\' replied the young\nfellow, pig-headedly, and yet gamely,\ntoo, for the matter of that, \'but I just\nwant to have the satisfaction of\nthrowing one like this on the counter\nand getting all of it, without any lay\ning off or monkey business. Hanover\nought to be at 1 to 1,000 anyhow.\'\n"Then the instrument began to\nclick, and Laggard pranced out and\nbeat the hide and hoofs off of the\nmighty, the well-nigh invincible Han\nover. Hanover just didn\'t feel like\nrunning that day, and he didn\'t. It\nwas worse than a defeat; it was a\ndisgrace; but that didn\'t help the\nstubborn young fellow any. He had\nthe gloomy job of getting that combin\nation ticket framed, and I\'ll bet it\nholds the record as the meanest un\ncashed horse race ticket that was\never scribbled with a blunt pencil.\n"There was a truck driver out in\nSt. Louis six years ago who had the\nhorse fever pretty bad, and who\ndropped his change around the pool\nrooms about as fast as he earned it.\nOne day he turned up at the fair\ngrounds with about $8 in his pocket\nand the winners all picked to a moral\ncertainty. He had \'em all written\ndown on a piece of yellow wrapping\npaper, and went to eight different\nbookmakers and gut them each to\nlay him $S 0 H to $1 against his bunch\nof selections. The horses on the list\nwere nearly all lobsters, and the\nbookies considered that they might\njust as well annex the $i bills for the\nride back to town.\n"The truck driver walked around\nwith his little bundle of eight combin\nation tickets calling for $(i,400 to $8\nwith an it\'s-all-over-but-the-cashing\ngrin on his homely phiz, and he was\nthe butt of the gang in the ring. Then\nthe races began, and blamed if live\nof the truckman\'s selections didn\'t\nwin right out of the pump. Scratches\nhad reduced the last race to a field of\ntwo by the time booking was due to\nbegin on that race, and one of the\nhorses—the one the truck driver had\npicked for his combination—so far\noutclassed the other that most of the\nbookies held him out altogether in the\nbetting, while some of them chalked\nup t to 12. By this time the eight\nbookies who laid $800 to $1 against\nthe truck driver\'s combination weft\nperspiring a heap at the forehead,\nand each of tliemsenta representative\nto the truckman to find out if the fel\nlow would accept $500 cash for his\nticket.\n"Well, jes\' to oblige you,\' replied\nthe truckman to each of the book\nmaker\'s representatives, and he stuff\ned $-1,000 into his clothes, and went\ninto the grand stand to enjoy the\nrace. The 1 to 12 favorite was a\ncranky horse, and as soon as he got\nout on the track, with the other horse\nfollowing docilely after him, he gave\na jump, and off he went, running\naway like an ice yacht. The boy on\nhim tried to choke the brute to death,\nbut the horse had the bit in his teeth,\nand he raced at full speed for a mile\nbefore the jock could pull him up.\nThen the two horses got away, and\nthe crab beat the 1 to 12 favorite as\nfar as you could throw a baseball.\nThe truck driver turned up and laugh\ned at the bookies who had bought his\ncombination tickets back, and all they\ncould do was to cuss deep and gru\nsomely and throw\' things at him."\nThe Christmas Bee, 16-page edition\nin colors and halftones, will be\nmailed, postage paid, to any address\nIn the United States or Canada.

Now the greatest obstacle that\nthe state department has encounter\ned in t no effort to collect our own\nclaims was the vast accumulation of\nEuropean claims against Turkey,\nleading the government of the latter\ncountry to plead that it could not pay\nour claims without paying the others,\nwhich would be utterly impossible.\nThe British claims are said to be\nmany fold larger than our own. and\nif they are to be pressed now, before\nour own claims are collected, it is\nfeared that the Turkish government\nwill use the fact as a basis for de\nclining to pay at present.\nHOLIDAY VACATION.\nSchools Closed for Two Weeks—En\ntertainment Greatly Enjoyed.\nThe public schools closed for a two\nweeks\' Christmas vacation yesterday\nafternoon with the usual Christmas\nexercises, but this year they were\nmore elaborate than at any time in\nthe past.
