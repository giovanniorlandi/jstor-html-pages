        <pre>['. . the hopes that undoubtedly existed in Russia of a relaxation of \nagrarian policy after the war, as was the case after every major war \nduring the past century, were dashed.”\nSoviet Agriculture and \nthe New Look\nBy Lazar Volin\nUnited States Department of Agriculture\nS INCE Stalin’s death in 1953, as at \nevery other critical juncture in Rus\xad\nsian history, the agricultural problem \nhas come again to the fore as a crucial \nnational issue; and this despite the fact \nthat contemporary Russia has lost much \nof its formerly predominant agrarian \ncharacter. The profusion of official de\xad\ncrees and lengthy reports and speeches \nby Soviet leaders and officials since Au\xad\ngust, 1953, certainly points to a deep \ndisturbance of the regime over the agri\xad\ncultural situation.\nIn fact, on this side of the “ Iron Cur\xad\ntain” the impression has gained cur\xad\nrency that the U.S.S.R. has been passing \nthrough a sharp agricultural crisis. This \nimpression has not been dissipated by \nthe puzzling admission of the former \nPremier, G. M. Malenkov, in his humili\xad\nating resignation statement a year ago, \nof responsibility for errors on the agri\xad\ncultural front; although his successful \nrival Nikita Khrushchev has been just \nas closely or even more closely identified \nwith the administration of Soviet agri\xad\nLAZAR VOLIN has been with the United \nStates Department of Agriculture since \n1926 and is now Special Assistant in the \nForeign Agricultural Service. He has \nmade the study of Russian agriculture his \nspecialty and is the author of a Survey \nof Soviet Russian A griculture, published \nby the Department in 1951. He has con\xad\ntributed to a number of other publications \nand magazines.\nculture during the last years of the \nStalin era.\nBut apart from the obvious uneasiness \nin the Kremlin, is there actually an \nagricultural crisis in the Soviet Union? \nThe term “crisis”  in its literal, dic\xad\ntionary or popular sense, meaning a sud\xad\nden catastrophe or collapse, is hardly \ngermane when applied to the Soviet \nagricultural situation. It is more ap\xad\npropriate to speak of a chronic weak\xad\nness of the Soviet collective agriculture \nwhich was intensified by the war and, \nmore recently, by mother nature through \nthe successive visitations of serious \ndroughts. Even apart from these lean \nyears, the weakness of Soviet agriculture \nwas manifested in inadequate production \nwhich could not do much more than \nmaintain a monotonous starchy diet for \nthe growing population. It could not im\xad\nprove the living standard of the people, \nso often promised by the Bolsheviks, nor \nincrease the small volume of agricultural \nexports, in which Russia was preem\xad\ninent before the First World War and \nRevolution. The Soviet agricultural prob\xad\nlem has been exactly the reverse of that \nin the United States, with its agricul\xad\ntural surpluses.\nDuring the Stalin era the inadequate \nproduction was partly obscured by the \nrelease, from time to time, of huge crop \nfigures obtained by the so-called biologi\xad\ncal method of estimating the crop on \nthe root prior to the harvest, which did \nnot take into account the officially ad\xad\nmitted usually large harvesting losses.\n13\n', '14 Current History, January, 1956\nThe figures thus obtained generally lent \nthemselves to exaggeration for fiscal and \npropaganda purposes. These estimating \npractices were at last denounced by \nMalenkov himself in August, 1953; thus \nconfirming the serious doubts enter\xad\ntained by many non-Soviet specialists of \nthe “ biological”  crop figures and the de\xad\ngree of agricultural progress based on \nthem. A telling admission of the lagging \ndevelopment of agriculture was given \nby Khrushchev when he disclosed that \nover-all agricultural production increased \nonly by 10 per cent between 1940 and \n1952, whereas industrial production more \nthan doubled. Actually, the gap between \nagriculture and industry may have been \neven greater because Khrushchev’s figure \nof a 10 per cent increase in agricultural \nproduction seems to be over-optimistic.\nBut the very rapidity and, as we \nshall see presently, lopsided character \nof the industrial development contributed \nheavily to the lagging state of agricul\xad\nture. This point is absolutely essential to \nthe understanding of the current Soviet \nagricultural situation and cannot be \nover-stressed. For the industrialization \npolicy pursued by Stalin, with its relent\xad\nless and overriding emphasis on the \nheavy industry manufacturing capital \ngoods and armaments required by the \nstate, and the corresponding neglect of \nthe light industry producing consumers \ngoods for popular demand, has been in\xad\nstrumental in squeezing the peasant \nfanner. He was required by means of \nthe compulsory delivery system and an\xad\ncillary devices to supply the state with \nincreasing quantities of foodstuffs to \nfeed the rapidly growing industrial pop\xad\nulation without receiving a proper equiv\xad\nalent in terms of manufactured goods \nsuch as textiles, footwear, household \ngoods, and so forth. The peasant paid \n“ something of a tribute,” in Stalin’s \nwords, on the altar o f industrialization.\nOr, in the technical vocabulary of \neconomics, agriculture was providing \ncapital for industrial expansion through \nforced savings. No wonder that the peas\xad\nant had to be tightly controlled in the \ncollective farms, for the pre-collectiviza\xad\ntion experience of the 1920’s demon\xad\nstrated that independent small farmers \ncould find ways and means to avoid \nsuch an exploitation by the state. Thus \nSoviet collective agriculture resembled \nCinderella, at least in the first part of \nthe fairy tale, when she was forced to \nwork hard but was deprived of the \namenities of life.\nTHE PEASANT\nBut whatever may have been true of \nCinderella, the Russian peasant, the \nkolkhoznik, was frequently reluctant to \ngive his best to the kolkhoz, (collective \nfarm ). We must bear in mind that the \nkolkhoznik, unlike the Soviet factory \nhand working for regular wages, or \neven the crop sharer in the under\xad\ndeveloped countries, is merely the resid\xad\nual claimant to an uncertain and often \nsmall income of the kolkhoz, after the \n. state has secured its share. As the many \nSoviet lamentations, supported by some \nWestern observers, testify, the peasant \ntends to be much more industrious on \nhis “ dwarf”  personal holding or kitchen \ngarden than on the large state-controlled \ncollective farms.\nIn addition to the small plots of land, \nthe kolkhozniks also are permitted to \nown a few animals. This personal farm\xad\ning of kolkhozniks is linked with a lim\xad\nited private market on which it is pos\xad\nsible to sell produce at prices determined \nby the operation of the supply and de\xad\nmand mechanism and usually much \nhigher than those paid by the govern\xad\nment for compulsory deliveries. How \nimportant this personal “ acre and a \ncow” farming became before the war \ncan be gauged from the fact that the \nkolkhozniks owned most of the livestock \nand accounted, according to Soviet esti\xad\nmates, for over a fifth of the total agri\xad\ncultural production in 1937 and for \nmore than 80 per cent of all supplies \nbrought to the private market in 1938.\nThis vigorous development, which re\xad\nsulted merely from the application of \nthe principle of free enterprise on a very \nlimited scale, gives us a glimpse o f what \na really free agriculture in Russia, with\n', 'Soviet Agriculture and the New Look 15\nconstructive state aid, could achieve. Lit\xad\ntle wonder that this dichotomy, this \nstrand of individualism in the collective \nfabric, stirring up memories of former \npeasant independence and leading to \ncompetition with the collective economy \nfor peasant labor and loyalty, became a \nthorn in the side of the Kremlin. And \nso, shortly before the war, personal \nfarming of kolkhozniks brought on itself \nthe wrath of the Kremlin in the form \nof various curbs which continued until \nthe very end of the Stalin era.\nAnimal husbandry particularly was \nadversely affected by this policy shift. \nThe more tolerant attitude of the Krem\xad\nlin towards the individual ownership of \nlivestock in the mid 1930’s, adumbrated \nabove, brought a substantial recovery \nfrom the disaster which befell livestock \nnumbers during the ruthless collectiviza\xad\ntion earlier in the decade. Since the war \n(which itself inflicted heavy losses) ani\xad\nmal husbandry has been regarded as \nthe weakest sector of Soviet agricul\xad\ntural economy. Khrushchev’s own figures \nshowed that livestock numbers, with \nthe exception of hogs, were lower at the \nbeginning of 1953 than before collec\xad\ntivization in 1928. This reduction is the \nmore significant because of the low prod\xad\nuctivity of livestock in the U.S.S.R.—  \nthe low yields of milk, meat and wool \nper animal. Furthermore, agriculture was \ndeprived of manure that was badly \nneeded on the poorer soils, especially on \nthe extensive podzolic soils of northern \nand north central Russia.\nTo illustrate the low productivity, the \naverage yield of milk per cow in 1951 \nwas less than 2,300 pounds. According to \nKhrushchev’s statement in 1953, the \nmilk yield per cow in the collective herds \nranged between 2,200 and 2,360 pounds \nannually during the “ past 10 years.” By \ncomparison, in the United States (where \nunlike the U.S.S.R., there is a sharp \nspecialization between the dairy and \nmeat cattle) the average milk yield per \nmilk cow exceeded 5,300 pounds in 1951- \n1952 and in some states even rose above \n7,000 pounds. Khrushchev revealed that \nsuch an old butter export region as Si\xad\nberia was producing less butter in 1952 \nthan in 1913. It is not surprising, there\xad\nfore, that there has been a shortage of \nbutter and that the U.S.S.R. is importing \ninstead of exporting butter. Obviously, \nunless a significant improvement could \nbe effected in animal husbandry, no \nprogress could be achieved in raising \nthe living standard and the diet, de\xad\npendent as they are on meat, milk, ani\xad\nmal fats, wool and hides.\nThe unsatisfactory state of animal \nhusbandry and of many other sectors of \nagriculture (and I do not want to im\xad\nply that there was no agricultural \nprogress at all—there was, notably in \nwheat and cotton) had not deterred in \nthe slightest the relentless pursuit by \nthe Stalin regime of the policy of col\xad\nlectivization and squeezing the peasants \nthrough high compulsory delivery re\xad\nquirements. Not only was agriculture \ncollectivized in the regions annexed since \nthe war, but a new drive, spearheaded \nby Khrushchev, began in 1950 to merge \nkolkhozy into still larger super-collectives \nthroughout the breadth and width of the \nvast country. No regard was paid to the \ngreatly varying climatic, soil, topo\xad\ngraphic, demographic and economic con\xad\nditions of different regions, as the more \nthan 250 thousand collectives at the be\xad\nginning of 1950 were merged into 89 \nthousand. It was as if the cure for the \nills of collectivism was more collectivism.\nGIGANTOMANIA\nThe slogan under which the merger \ncampaign was conducted was the old \nMarxist thesis of the superior efficiency \nof large scale production in agriculture \nas in industry, without any limitations \nattached. This kind of a gigantomania \nreceived a severe jolt and much official \ncensure during the early 1930’s when \nmany giant farms proved so unwieldy \nthat they had to be subdivided. Yet 20 \nyears later the “ experiment”  was re\xad\npeated with a vengeance. Officially it was \npronounced a great success but last sum\xad\nmer at a conference in Riga, Latvia, \nKhrushchev guardedly admitted that \nthere may be some need for subdivision.\n', '16 Current History, January, 1956\nThat the enlargement of farms re\xad\nsulting from mergers has contributed to \ntechnical and economic efficiency is in \nmost cases dubious or just the opposite. \nHowever, by stretching the gap between \nmanagement, staffed increasingly by out\xad\nsiders, and the rank and file membership \nof a kolkhoz, mergers doubtless in\xad\ncreased the driving power of the for\xad\nmer over the latter. At the same time, \nelections of officials and democratic self- \ngovernment of the kolkhoz became even \nmore of a fiction than they were before \n1950.\nThus, the hopes that undoubtedly ex\xad\nisted in Russia of a relaxation of agrar\xad\nian policy after the war, as was the case \nafter every major war during the past \ncentury, were dashed. On the contrary, \nthe screw on the peasant was tightened. \nIt is necessary to go back as far as the \nend of the Napoleonic wars in the early \nNineteenth Century to find an historic \nprecedent. Then all the patriotism and \nheroism displayed by the peasants, who \nexpected in return liberation from hated \nserfdom, merited only a single line in \nTsar Alexander I’s manifesto of 1814, \nin which his Majesty “ most graciously”  \nthanked all classes and granted them \nvarious privileges. This single line ran, \n“The peasants, our loyal people, will be \nrecompensed by God.”\nStalin, to be sure, was also interested \nin the expansion of agricultural produc\xad\ntion ; but firmly entrenched as his regime \nwas, especially after a victorious war, \nthere was no urgency in the matter. \nFabian tactics of gradualism would do. \nThe consumer could wait a little longer \nfor a genuine, not a propagandists im\xad\nprovement in the standard of living. The \npeasant, if necessary, could be squeezed \na little harder.\nAnd then there was the “ pie in the \nsky”  promise of a spectacular increase \nin production by the magic of pseudo\xad\nscience, presided over by Trofim Lysenko \nof anti-Mendelian genetics notoriety, who \nfor a number of years used to the ut\xad\nmost his practically dictatorial authority \nin a vain attempt to ruin Russian \nbiological and agricultural sciences. Par\xad\nenthetically, according to an authoritative \nand devastating critique of Lysenkoism \nin the Soviet Botanical Journal (No. 2, \n1955), the “ new teaching”  of Lysenko \n“ undermines the basis of cultural meth\xad\nods (agrotechnique) of many crops.” \nThe “ pseudo-science”  was at the root \nof much of the grandiose “ Stalin plan for \nreconstruction of nature.” It embraced \ncomplicated crop rotation schemes, indis\xad\ncriminately including perennial grasses \nand some cultural practices unsuitable to \nthe drier regions, the vast tree shelter \nbelts of dubious viability and costly ir\xad\nrigation projects.\nLast but not least was the mechaniza\xad\ntion of agriculture, primarily of the \nheavier field operation such as plowing \nand much of the harvesting. There has \nbeen a great enthusiasm for tractors \namong the Bolsheviks ever since Lenin \nclaimed that if the peasants were given \n100 thousand tractors with the necessary \nfuel, and so on, they would be in favor \nof communism. (Of course, Lenin recog\xad\nnized at the time that this was merely a \ndream.) That American invention—the \ntractor— bolstered the Marxist faith in \nthe efficacy of large scale agricultural \nproduction which at the turn of the cen\xad\ntury was dealt rather heavy blows by the \nso-called Revisionists. It certainly proved \na great boon to the Bolsheviks. When \nStalin’s gruesome collectivization cam\xad\npaign, which he confessed to Churchill \nwas even a greater ordeal than the war, \nbrought about a catastrophic reduction \nin the number of horses, the largely im\xad\nported American tractors filled the dan\xad\ngerous breach. This was before the big \nnew tractor plants at Stalingrad, Khar\xad\nkov and Chelyabinsk were built.\nDespite the continuously reported inef\xad\nficiency in the operation of tractors \nand grain combines (harvester-thresher), \nanother Am erican invention widely \nadopted by the Soviets, these helped to \nmake collective farming if not a going, \nat least a limping concern. Mechaniza\xad\ntion made possible a transfer o f much \nmanpower from agriculture into indus\xad\ntry. Agriculture became increasingly a \nwoman’s occupation. Still, the number of\n', 'Soviet Agriculture and the New Look 17\nworkers engaged in farming continues \nto be astonishingly large, as the observa\xad\ntions of the American and other re\xad\ncent foreign agricultural delegations con\xad\nfirmed.\nBut this is not the whole story. For in \nthe U.S.S.R. the role of the tractor and \nthe implements it pulls far transcends \npreparation of soil and harvesting of \ncrops because machines have been turned \nby the Kremlin to political and fiscal ad\xad\nvantage. Tractors, combines and other \ncomplicated machinery are not owned by \ncollectives, but are concentrated in state \nmachine-tractor stations, or M.T.S. These \nservice the collective farms and are paid \nby the latter in kind, at rates fixed by \nthe government.\nHere is an important expedient for \nextracting farm products from collective \nagriculture, in fact one of increasing \nimportance. In .1954 payments of grain \nto M.T.S. were more than double the \ncompulsory delivery quotas. Incidentally, \nthe combine, in addition to its various \ntechnical advantages, has been a very \nconvenient device for the channeling of \ngrain directly from the field to the state \nelevator or warehouse, skipping the kolk\xad\nhoz. The M.T.S. have been also assigned \nan increasingly significant role in the \ncontrol and management of collective \nagriculture.\nIt may be noted that the U.S.S.R. still \nlags behind the United States in the ex\xad\ntent of agricultural mechanization, espe\xad\ncially in view of the larger crop acreage \nin the former. The U.S.S.R. had in 1954 \nroughly 400 thousand tractors, 326 thou\xad\nsand grain combines, 370 thousand mo\xad\ntor trucks, over 16 million horses and \n410 million acres sown to crops; the \nUnited States had 4.3 million tractors \n(exclusive of garden types), 950 thou\xad\nsand combines, 2.65 million motor trucks, \nless than 3.5 million horses and 345 mil\xad\nlion acres sown to crops.\nSuch was in general the agricultural \nlegacy which Stalin bequeathed to his \nsuccessors. Unlike their late master, the \nheirs had to make some propitiating ges\xad\ntures to the populace. For it has been an \nold tradition in Russian history that\nwhen an autocrat passes away, there is \na strong popular sentiment that it is \ntime for a change also in other direc\xad\ntions— a change for the better, of course. \nThis meant that the improvement of the \nliving standard and the agricultural \nproblem acquired a new urgency. Hence \nthe Kremlin’s great activity on the agri\xad\ncultural front, aiming to increase agri\xad\ncultural production as fast as possible.\nAGRARIAN CHANGE?\nWhat is the nature of this new Soviet \nagrarian offensive? At the outset it \nshould be borne in mind that the basic \nstructure of collective farming has re\xad\nmained unchanged and all measures that \nare being taken are carried out within \nits framework. In fact, the control of \nthe Communist Party and of the M.T.S. \nover collective farming has been tight\xad\nened. The minimum of labor required \nfrom the kolkhozniks was raised. Capital \ninvestment by the state for machin\xad\nery, fertilizer, construction, agricultural \ncredit, and so forth, were up, though \nthe collective farms were also required \nto increase their capital investments. \nMany agricultural specialists and skilled \nworkers, such as tractor drivers or com\xad\nbine operators, who left the farms were \ntransferred from the cities to the M.T.S. \nand collectives.\nMeasures were taken to make more \nflexible and to simplify and decentralize \nthe state planning procedure. Of great \nimportance has been the new emphasis \non economic incentives to the peasants. \nAs a result, the personal farming of the \nkolkhozniks has received a new lease on \nlife, albeit a temporary one, as implied \nby Khrushchev. Agricultural taxation \nwas simplified and lowered; delivery \nquotas for various products were re\xad\nduced and prices paid by the government \nfor the produce acquired were increased, \nin many cases substantially. Advances \npaid to the kolkhozniks before the final \ndistribution of the income at the end of \nthe year were raised for some products. \nWhile the new program initiated by \nMalenkov and Khrushchev began in 1953 \nwith animal husbandry and some non\xad\n', '18 Current History, January, 1956\ngrain crops, it was extended in 1954 to \nwheat and other small grains, which \nheretofore were considered by the Krem\xad\nlin as a problem largely solved.\nHere Stalin’s heirs took again the \npath that the late dictator had chosen \nin the early 1930’s, namely, tremendous \nacreage expansion on virgin or long- \nuncultivated land mainly used for graz\xad\ning in the eastern regions of the coun\xad\ntry, beyond the Volga and the Urals. \nThis is largely an area of limited rain\xad\nfall, frequently recurrent droughts, short \ngrowing seasons and, consequently, pre\xad\ncarious farming. Principally for these \nreasons, and because of organizational \nshortcomings, the earlier drive under \nStalin backfired. But now the experi\xad\nment is to be repeated and an area of \n69-74 million acres is to be sown to \ngrain by 1956. This is more than one \nfourth of the total grain area in the \nU.S.S.R. in 1953 and exceeds the 1954 \nwheat acreage in the United States, \nwhich was 54 million acres.\nA relatively modest beginning was \nmade in the spring of 1954 when less \nthan 10 million acres were planted. \nWeather conditions were unusually fa\xad\nvorable in many of these eastern regions \nwhile the important southern granary \nof the U.S.S.R. was suffering from a \nserious drought. This fact undoubtedly \nlent encouragement to the new grain \nprogram. In the spring of 1955, 50 mil\xad\nlion acres were planted to wheat and \nother grains in the marginal eastern \narea. But this time, unlike 1954, a seri\xad\nous drought greatly reduced crop yields \nin these regions. It is a foregone conclu\xad\nsion that if the Soviet Government is to \ncontinue with this program, requiring \na considerable investment of resources \n(tractors, machinery, building materi\xad\nals) , it will have to be satisfied with low \naverage per acre yields because of the \nrecurring droughts. In the meantime, a \nconsiderable movement of new settlers, \nmostly young workers from the western \nand central regions, was organized, and \nthere have been many complaints in the \nSoviet press of the harsh living condi\xad\ntions which they encountered.\nThe latest move of Khrushchev on the \nagrarian scene is the tremendous com \nexpansion program to bolster the lag\xad\nging forage supply. Forage has long \nbeen one of the bottlenecks in the live\xad\nstock situation and corn is a fine feed \ncrop. This program replaced the exten\xad\nsive cultivation of grasses during the \nStalin era, concerning which a few words \nneed to be said, since the episode typifies \nthe uncritical atmosphere which doubt\xad\nless impedes agricultural progress in the \nU.S.S.R. In accordance with a theory \ndeveloped by a well known Communist \nsoil scientist, Professor Williams of the \nTimiryazev Academy in Moscow, and \nfully accepted by the then dominant \nLysenko school, perennial grasses were \nto be grown in crop rotation in all re\xad\ngions as a soil-improving crop as well as \na source of hay. The acreage under \ngrasses was considerably increased not \nonly in the humid regions to which they \nare suitable, but also in the drier areas \nin which they do not grow well.\nBut the expansion of low yielding \ngrasses was partly at the expense of the \nmore productive feed grains, such as \nbarley or oats, thus affecting adversely \nthe feed supply. Although the disad\xad\nvantages of indiscriminate pushing of \ngrasses were doubtless known to Rus\xad\nsian specialists, until Khrushchev blasted \nthis development in the spring of 1954, \nnothing could be done about it under \nthe Soviet practice of stifling all crit\xad\nicism, once a party line is adopted by \nthe Kremlin.\nBut let us return to the corn program. \nKhrushchev, who has long been known \nas a com  enthusiast and had in the past \nexhorted unsuccessfully the Soviet farm\xad\ners to increase corn production, now \ntackled the problem by a decree which \nmeant business. Corn, which has been a \nminor crop in the U.S.S.R., was to be ex\xad\npanded to an area of not less than 70 \nmillion acres by 1960. This may be com\xad\npared to the present United States acre\xad\nage of around 80 million acres under \ncorn. Already in 1955, more than 40 \nmillion acres were planted to corn, or \nfour times as much as a year earlier,\n', 'Soviet Agriculture cmd the New Look 19\nreplacing not only low yielding grasses, \nbut also some of the traditional Russian \nfeed grains. Just as grasses were for\xad\nmerly extended into regions with most \ndiverse climatic conditions, so corn was \nnow.\nAlthough Khrushchev was influenced \nby the American corn experience, there is \nno extensive area in the U.S.S.R. where \nthe unique combination of climatic and \nsoil conditions of our com belt is repro\xad\nduced. In most of the U.S.S.R. it is \neither too dry or too cold for a good \ngrowth of com and that is mainly the \nreason why corn had occupied such a \nmodest place in the Russian crop pat\xad\ntern. As a matter of fact, even the \nKhrushchev program contemplates that \nmuch of the corn will be harvested be\xad\nfore it reaches maturity stage and will \nbe used for silage, rather than primarily \nfor grain, as in the United States. Other \nfactors, such as lack of suitable varieties \nand shortages of fertilizer, machinery, \nlabor power and know-how, also should \nhave militated against a hastily impro\xad\nvised crash program of corn expansion \non so vast a scale. However, all these \nbut the climate may be overcome in \ntime.\nThe com program and the new real\xad\nization in the Kremlin of the value of \nforeign experience in overcoming tech\xad\nnical deficiencies have contributed much \nto the resumed practice of foreign travel \nby Soviet agricultural personnel and, on \na more restricted scale, of Western agri\xad\nculturalists in the U.S.S.R. Whatever \nthe advantages to the West, it is indis\xad\nputable that the end of cultural isolation \nshould prove beneficial to Soviet agri\xad\nculture.\nTo sum up: a breakdown of Soviet \nagriculture is surely not in the cards, \nthough much weakness and inefficiency \nhas been evident. If, as has often been \nsaid, agriculture represents an Achilles \nheel of Soviet economy, it is the kind of \nheel on which one can walk. The post- \nStalin agricultural program is pivoted \nfundamentally on the existing super-col\xad\nlective farm system in which some ad\xad\njustments and concessions were projected \nin the interest of efficiency. Some of \nthese measures, such as the increasing \nscope permitted to economic incentives, \nthe greater flexibility of state planning \nand increased state capital investment, \nseem on the whole sensible and realistic. \nOthers, like the new grain expansion \nprogram and the shift to com, appear \nto be dubious.\nMuch also depends on how the various \nphases of the program are carried out, \ninasmuch as there is usually a wide gap \nbetween plans and performance. This \nalready applies, for instance, to the new \nplanning procedure itself in its practical \napplication. Again, increased economic \nincentives presuppose a very substantial \nrise in the output of consumers manu\xad\nfactured goods, if inflationary pressure \nof rubles chasing goods is to be avoided. \nBut in this respect, the Soviet climate \nhas become much less favorable since \nMalenkov’s “ resignation”  early in 1955, \naccompanied as it was by the renewed \nemphasis on the development of the \nheavy industry. It also should not be \noverlooked that better weather reflected \nin larger crops in 1955 is bound to im\xad\nprove automatically the immediate agri\xad\ncultural outlook.\nIn the longer run, the impact of the \nlarge additional number of mouths to be \nfed, to the tune of about 3 million an\xad\nnually, though welcome to the Bolsheviks \nfor whom Malthus is a bete noir, does \nnot make the national food problem any \nless difficult. Nor is it made easier by the \nfact that population growth has been \nmost rapid in the urban sector which \ncannot be expected to fend for itself as \nthe peasants do. Of course, only time can \ntell how effective the new program will \nbe in substantially raising agricultural \nproduction. Certainly, the experience of \na quarter of a century with the reg\xad\nimented collective farm system does not \naugur well for a speedy rehabilitation of \nthe Soviet “ problem child.”\nlono:\n']</pre>
