At Yale, during\nthe last academic year, 1202 students, working at all kinds of jobs,\nearned $170,411." The total earnings of 500 men partly or wholly earn\ning heir way through Princeton totalled $161,530.\nThese .excellent records pale beside that of the University of\nNorth Carolina, where 1280 students out of a total of 1700 did work.\nTheir : earnings, came to $384,000. These earnest youths welcomed any\nkind of honest employment. Some shoyeled coal, others cultivated\ngardens, washed windows, split wood, pressed clothes, waited on ta\nbles, scrubbed floors and even tended babies. The picture of their\noccupations would amply refute Thomas A. Edison\'s charge that col\nlege men do not like to work.\nThere i3 . movement in certain colleges to utilize some of the\nprofits from football games to help students who have to do drudgery\nin order to live while they study. During the past football season mil\nlions in ticket money poured in. Even a modest percentage of the\nlotal would redeem ihe lost hours of many a needy jundersraduate.\nAt present a large part of this jOioney goes to support certain branches\nof athletics which do not meet their cost. Money probably goes in\nsome cases easy come, easy gor-to keep up unnecessarily large foot\nball establishments.\nIt is true the ffthletic associations give "students remunerative\nprivileges, such as selling refreshments at the games or parking cars.\nThey could do vastly more. The tens of thousands of football. enthu\nsiasts who flock to see the games would pay the gate receipts with\nadded satisfaction if assured that a part of the money would go fo\nhelp struggling students through the college course.
