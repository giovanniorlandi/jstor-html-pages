V\nANOTHER IDIOTIC OUTBURST.\nL\'Observateur Shows Growth In Size, But Not In Brains.\nWhen the news first reached us that L\'O\')servateur" had receive;d\na lager press iind wa, comine out in the field of .jourlnai:,n .,s a\nstandard size ne:wsp ipe,\', our h<pes were that its gro;vwth in w.islo!oi\nand decency would be \'n proportion to its growth in si;:: M1u,}h t.o\nour regrets, our hopes were shattered when we read its lsL issue\nand saw that same contained the usual non sensical outýiursts, ,\ncharacteristic of its maniac editor\nThe vocabulary of its writer is as nigerly and Lhose as ::ual, if not\nmore bo. Yet L\'Observateur boasts in gleeful terms about is humn\nble entrance in the newspaper field a few years ago ;,.\'Il h,:w ,by\nconstant industry and patriotic devotion it has attained its present t\nzenith in the journalistic wr.rld. How romantic: Surely, to the un\ninformed or those not acquainted with the facts. such a suddeil Ip, 4\nto prosperity and public good will as L\'Observateur attempts to t\nimpress upon its readers, would be remarkable food for a romance. (\nBut unfortunately for L\'Observateur the people of Sr. .Johln. the\ninformed public, know the "why" and the "\'how" of its growth :\nas a standard-size news.paper. The first is so that L\'Observateur i\nmight boost up the Hart Candidates, (a thing they are very much\nin need of, and about which L\'Ob;eervateur has been silnt so far)\nand continue its idiotic ,!eniunciation of the present :d.ministr\'ation.\nHow vwas thi gro. th accomplished? By none other than rt. a!lered t\nlmoneyed mnn of the Hart Faction, surely inot by the miserlyv cli:.,r r\n(f L\'Observateur. W i, h this reason for its growth we might ad I\nthat altho it now has the b ,dy of a real newspaper, unf\'ortunately\nit still has the brains of a yellow sheet Its editor apparently\' holds\non to the same policy of falsification and indecency for which he is t\nnoted throughout the lengtn and breadth of this parish.\nIn our last issue we euoogized our sheriff for th . c)n,)pe :n"v and\nhonesty of his administration, and simply becanme we spouý:e the I\ntruth, L\'Observateur se-nis to have been offended and its I lat is- <\nsue was a frantic attack on the sheriff. As w:`: have said already, (\nif the slanderous editor of L\'Observateur were cap:tbl, of bin e\nhed legally responsible in :damages for his fabricated stat e:.ents,\nwe have no doubt in the world that our slanderad sheri f would\nseek his relief in the courts, but everybody knowvs this procedur\'\nwould be a vain and useless thing because ther- i stii] s: \'iv:,>\njudgment, r.endered by twelve bona fide citiz\' ns of this ra.v-"rn,\nagainst Wallace Lasseigne for libel and na:n\' cinn,)t be s::, i-\'iý.l\nas he owns absolutely nothing. Even lately an additional charge,\ncriminal in its nature, was preferred against our insolent and rec k\nless would-be editor for the. publication of a libalous statemi nt.\nSome of these days lie is g,,ing to jump on s,,ni-one who is g.ing\nto settle his case outside of court, and it might not be an amicable\nsettlement either.\nIn its last issue, not satisfied with having libeled the sheriff, he\ngave vent to a false and malicious statement about our old and\nvenerable friend Sir. Engine Picoa c mncrnint his supp)el fail\nure to pay a parish license of $503) for operatinga barrom in Gary\nville. With very little trouble, and had not Mr. L\'Observateur\ndisplayed his usual haste in his publications, he could have found\nout that the license in question was issued and paid far in full. He\nstill clings to his old tactics in regard to persons who are supposed\n(by him) to be operating bar rooms without licenses, others opera\nting two saloons with one license and others selling all kinds of\nliquor on half licenses.\nThose same vague charges were made by the same editor many\nmonths ago when he was fighting the Berthelot Faction, which at\nthat time comprised the present Hart clique, and Editor Lasseign\nwas then summoned before the grand jury in order to verify these i\nso-called charges, but the ignorant witness, after using a lot of gen\neralities,\' failed completely to make or prefer any specific charge.\nAg&ain in his last issue the alleged charges are generalities and, no1\ndoubt, creatures of his heat oppressed brains, but he does not make\nI any specific accusations, well knowing that he cannot make a charge\nagainst any particular individual whom he imagines is conducting\na bar-room as alleged.\nApparently, his only object in making these vac ie and indefinite\ncharges is to poison the public mind and vilify the sheriff and there I\nby give the Hart Faction more hopes of recovery.\nL\'Observateur states that when we boost and praise the sheriff\nwe do so without sufficient information concerning his public and\nprivate records. We feel assured that we have all the necessar-y\ninformation about Mr. Berthelot whenever we make any state\nment about him, but we wonder if Mr. L\'Observateur has ever\nundertaken the job of digging up the record of the hero of his\nfaction. From his silence on that score we presume that he has i\nrealized that such a "rake-up" would not be worth the trouble nor\nprinting. Being advocates of clean journalism we are perfectly\nwilling on that point to let the "dead past bury itself", but we\nwish to hereby warn L\'Observateur that if it persists in waging\npolitical battle under its present rotten tactics, and intends\nto fight the cause of the Hart faction on the demerits\n,or supposed demerits of our candidate instead of on the merits of\nits candidate, we propose to retaliate by bringing out the proper\n~evidence before the public in order to, "show up" its candidate in\nhis trie light. Wo understand that Mr. Hart, when he first made\nI public his intention of becoming a candidate for sheriff, stated that\nhe was going to ruin on his merits and not on the demerits of his\nopponent. We had endorsed that policy and our sheriff intended to\nSmake the race on the same platform. But if now Mr. Hart or his of\nSficial organ sees fit to invert his former plan and run solely on the\ndemerits of his opponent, we intend to follow suit and not to let a\nstone unturned in our endeavor to enlighten the public as to the\ndemerits of our opposing candidate for sneriff:\nLOCAL PERSONALS,\n\'Those We Meet, Hear of and\nSee During the Week.\nVisitors in and out of the\n-Paris.\nMr. Li.

Mr. Ralph Peters,\nChairman of the Railway Mail Committee, when asked\nto state the railroad side of the controversy to the\nAmerican farmer, said In part:\n"The railway mail pay question will be settled-and\nsettled permanently and with justice to all concerned\nas soon as the American people realize that the whole\nsubject, while seemingly complicated and technical, boils\ndown to a few simple points of fair business dealing\nwhich no one need be a rate expert to understand.\n"The first is that the Post Office Department weighs the mails, and re\nadjusts the pay of the railroads, only once In four years. This compels the\nrailroads to carry the increase in the mail tonnage during the intervening\nyears without pay-manifestly an injustice In te case of a rapidly growing\nbusiness. One consequence has been that last year the railroads carried fully\nhalf the parcel post for nothing.\n"A second point is this: In addition to carrying the mails, the rail\nroads are required to operate many traveling post offices for sorting and\ndistributing the trails while in transit. But the Post Omce Department pays\nfor such post offices only where they occupy whole cars, and pays nothing\nin the many cases in which it merely requires the use of post office apart\nments in combination cars, although such apartments differ from the full\nrailway post office cars only in size. More than 4,200 apartments of this\ncharacter have been fitted up, and are maintained for the exclusive use of\nthe Post Office Department. Failure to pay for them has been ian especial\nhardship to the smaller roads on which the Department does not find it\nnecessary to utilize whole cars.\n"One last point: In thousands of instances (though not in all) the Post\nOffice Department requires the railroads to carry the mails back and forth\nbetween railroad stations and post offloes, but pays them nothing for this\nextra service beyond the rates covering the rail transportation. The rail\nroads have no choice but to perform this additional service gratis, or refuse\nto carry the mails at all.\n"Now for the remedies the railroads ask" They do not ask to have the\nmails weighed daily, or to have each shipment weighed and paid for sep\narately, as is done in the case of private shippers. They merely ask to\nhave the mails weighed, and the pay of the railroads adjusted, at least once\na year, instead of once in four years. They also ask that apartment post\noffice cars be paid for, at reasonable rates, according to size. Lastly, they\nask that the Post Office Department cease to require of them free messenger\nservice between stations and post offices, and either relieve them of thi\nservice or pay fairly for it. These are the reforfns the railroads ask of Con\ngres. They gladly lay these reforms before the public, confident that they\nwill appeal to the common sense andýfairness of American voters."\n* DON\'T BUY THAT NEW CAR\n.f -- -Until You Have Seen The -\n4 1916 STUDEBAKER\nFOUR CYLINDER ( Forty B.
