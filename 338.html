Silas drove\nstation through the shady\nI\nlanes of maples leading to the little\nfarmhmiKA flisnnnnnfl cimvnc 4-V.o. annln\nA A. j -\nDuring the short drive he said but\nlittle, and when Silas asked him J a\nquestion he -lesitated, faltered and\nrubbed his chin before replying. When\nOld Gray turned down the lane where,\nthe robins were singing and the squir\nrels chippering, a trace of the old light\ncame back to: the old bachelor\'s eyes\nand the faded, sunken cheeks glowed a\n"Si," he murmured, laying his thin\nhand upon the other\'s knee, "let me\ndrive Old Gray home through the\nlane." . .\' ...\nThe lines hung listlessly from his\nhands as the old mare slowly walked\nalong the familiar place toward the\nhouse, where Mandy stood in the door\nway with a glad smile of welcome\noverspreading her kindly face. Then,\nwhen the horse halted at the block, he\nsaid handing over the lines:\n"I think I ; have been driving right\ninto Heaven, Si."\nWhy, Cousin Jim, I am so glad to\nsee you again. It seems so like old\ntimes to see you and Silas driving\nhome through the lane." And the\ngood woman came forward, with both\nhands outstretched. Her eyes grew\nmoist when she saw how feeble the\nold bachelor cousin was. She and\nSilas had to almost lift him from the\nbuggy, and her strong arms supported\nthe frail form as he walked with\ndragging steps up the gravel walk and\ninto the cool, flower-scented parlor. His\neyes roved about the quiet place and\nhe sighed:\n"Heaven, Heaven at last!"\n"You lie right down on the couch.\nCousin Jim, and take a nap- while I\nget supper. I\'ll call you in time to\nwash and freshen up. I\'m going to\nhave some raised biscuits and honey\nyou always liked that."\nThe tired man laid his head back and\nmurmured f\n"Dear Mandy! I am so glad to get\nback home again. I will rest for a\nfew moments. I am so tired and so\nso happy to get home home!" Mandy\nwent out and closed the parlor door.\n"This must be Heaven at last. It is\nso still, so sweet, so nice. To-morrow\nI will go down to the mill dam; I will\ngo to the old swimming hole under the\nwillows once more, where dear old Si\nand I used to swim. I will sit on the\nstoop in the cool of the evening and\nI will be at home once more with the\ngood and true and unselfish ones."\nAnd thus he murmured as he drifted\ninto the land of sweet dreams. At\nrest, finally, there in the cool, flower-\nscented parlor of the little farmhouse,\nafar from the noise and bustle of, the\ncity. \'\nThe bees buzzed among the lilacs,\nwhere the humming birds whirred; the\napple blossoms bunted against the\nblinds and the fragrant petals fell\nupon the sleeper\'s face but he did riot\nstir. He was dreaming of the dear\nold days of boyhood, days filled With\njoy and delight and sweetness.\nThen the good angel of the old man\'s\ndreams came in a chariot of silver, and\nhis \'eyelids were touched with a\' magic\nwand. He roved in green pastures.\nwhere blue cloud-fleeced skies bent;\nand he wandered by crystal streams in\nthe cool shady woodlands where birds\nmade glad the fragrant breezes of the\nsummer day of unending bliss.\nAnd then then it was no ldnger a\ndream. Oh. the glory of it all: It\nwas a blessed reality.\n"Jim!"\nThere came no response from the old\nman on the conch.\nSilas, come quick! All is not well\nwith poor Jim."\nThey approached the couch and\nlooked down upon the face. The tired\nlook had disappeared. There was a\nsmile instead. Cousin Jim \' was no\nlonger ill he was at rest, peacefully, at\nrest. And all was well with him.\nThe city relatives wailed when his\nwill was read.

Lippincotf s.\nA Long Weatlier Cycle.\nA long weather cycle of about thirty\nfive years seems to appear in the Brit\nish Isles. From records of ninety years,\nMr. Douglas Archibald concludes that a\ndry period has just passed, and that\nthe years 1903 to about 1920 will show\nmore than an average rainfall and low\nbarometer, and\' two bushels per acre\ndeficiency in wheat yield. -\n\' \' \' \' i1\n.... m y \' - \' \'\narm.\nICS\nGREEN FOOD IS NECESSARY.\nSome who raise poultry object tc\n"making such a fuss about their food,"\nhenee will not give them green food.\nThe best way \'to test the value of green\nfood is to take two lots of laying hens,\nfeeding one lot green food with the\ngrain several times a week and the\nother lot one-third more grain without\nthe green food. The result will be that\nthe first lot of hens;wlll laythe great\nest number of eggs.\' There is no par\nticular food value or egg-making value\nin the green food, but it has a decided\naction on the digestive organs, which is\nbeneficial. The hens that are fed grain\nwholly can not and do not give the\nbest returns in eggs.\nAs stated before in this department\nit makes little difference what the\ngreen food is, provided the hens like it,\nif it is fed with some changes (raw at\ntimes and cooked other days) and in\nsome variety. Every farmer who\ngrows potatoes has enough very small\ntubers to keep a large flock of hens in\ngood laying condition all winter, and\nfed in this way they will give better\nreturns than when fed to swine. In\ndianapolis News.\nFEEDING THE FALL CALF.\nWhen one has a calf which it is de\nsired be added to the dairy the point of\ngood care in its early years is of vital\nimportance. If in a section where the\ncalf cannot go out of doors a great\ndeal during the winter some provis\nion should be made so that she may\nhave exercise in an enclosure which is\ndry and where some sun may be had\nif possible. To a certain extent this\nis quite as important as the food the\ncalf has. One of the best rations for\nthe calf is skim milk, but it will not\ndo to make this any considerable of\nthe ration for the day, but in addition\nthe calf should have all the good clover\nhay it will eat. If this is not possible\nthen let the supply of corn fodder giv\nen be not only -liberal, but of the best\nquality; pick out the smaller stalks.\nthose that retain some of the green if\npossible.\nIf the calf is three months old or\nthereabouts, the grain food should con\nsist of from two to tonr pounds daily\nand may be corn and oats fed whole,\nalthough a mixture of equal parts of\ncorn meal, ground oats and wheat bran\nare more satisfactory. Treat it gent\nly, but do not spoil it by petting. Teach\nit habits of cleanliness by always keep\ning the stall clean and the coat brushed\nseveral times a week. A calf brought\nup in the manner described will make\na valuable addition to the dairy. In\ndianapolis News.\nKEEP CORN IN RATIONS.\nWhile most poultrymen advocate va\nriety in rations, and this means feeding\none grain one day and another the next\nand so on, rather than feeding mixed\ngrains, it is well understood that there\nare cases where the mixed grains. must\nbe fed. Unfortunately, too many fowls\nare fed freely on corn and too little of\nother grains. The mixture known as\nscreenings is, of late years, of little\nvalue, and when it is desirable for any\nreason to .feed mixed grains rather\nthan, the one grain by itself there is no\ncombination that should lack the corn.\n1 For example, if w-heat and. oats are\nto be fed, add one-third of corn, mak\ning the ration one-third each of wheat,\noats and corn and one has a ration\nmuch better than the combination of\nwheat and oats alone. The corn, if ol\nthe yellow sort, will add richness to the\neggs, and if this ration is supplemented\nwith liberal supplies of green food the\nquality of the eggs will be all that is\ndesirable, and the hens will supply\nthem in goodly numbers. \' While - the\nother little accessories are very desir\nable, we believe that if all who have\npoultry would work along from the be\nginning, during the cold months on\nthe mixed grain ration, which contains\none-third corn with the green food and\nkeep their houses clean and free from\nvermin, the results would be so satis\nfactory that they would willingly add\nthe other little comforts which they\nnow terra "frills."

John M. Davidson Man\'s In\nterest iu the Incarnation A Striking\nThought About the \'Divinity of Man.\'\nBrooklyn," N." Y. In the Fourth Uni\ntarian Church, Flatbush, Sunday morning,\nthe pastor, the Rev. John M. Davidson, I\npreached on "What Are the Permanent I\nElements of Religion?" He said:\nIn this period ot ouestionmg. when old\nstructures of ; religious faith are being torn\ndown and new ones are taking their places.\nwhen what seems the very foundation of\nfaith is being removed here and there to\nmake way for new material, it is well\nworth our while to ask the question that\nis consequent upon such a condition, What\nelements of our religious faith are perma-\nnent and are likely to resist the tendency\nto change? It is a question that is agitat\ning more people than ever before m his\ntory. We have been told that there is a\ngrowing: indifference to religion, that men\nare abandoning the churches, that pagan\nism has re-absorbed large sections of the\ncountry,, even Puritan New England shar\ning in the general dissolution.\nNo one can deny that the influence of\nthe church is not as great as it was when\n. . - \'. 1\nalmost the only educated men were min\nisters. We who occupy the pulpits to\nday, frankly recognize the fact that the\noccupants of the pews are . not only our\nediials in intellect, but are capable of giv\ning us instruction in many departments of\nthought wherein the ..minister of old time\nwas held to be supreme. The minister of\nto-day . must \' "recognize his relatively\nchanged : condition. : He addresses minds\nat least as well informed and as bright as\nhis own and on many subjects more so,\nAnd \' he is woefully mistaken and uhalert\nif he does not welcome the change as an\nadvantage to himself and his work rather\nthan a detriment. Nevertheless, for the\ntime being, this condition tends to bring\ndown the church attendance figures and\nto lessen the church s influence. It will\ncontinue to do so .until, the church finds\nmen who are leaders (if not in intellect)\nin the effort for social amelioration. They\nmust be specialists and authorities in\ntheir field, as the physicians and lawyers\nare in medicine and jurisprudence.\nThat the temnorarv falling off in the in\nfluence of the church as an institution ar\ngues for an indifference to religion I do\nnot believe. Ihe church \' has not yet\nlearned its work. -;It is still delving in\ntheologies and philosophies, when men\nare no more interested in the one than\nthe other. . Both theology and philosophy\nare vital matters, but the old manner of\ndiscussing these subjects cannot now inter -\nest men who are touched by the spirit.\nof the scientific age. Until science and the\nwhole new method ot thought that toi -\nlows unon recent scientific discovery have\nentered into and vivified theology and phil -\nosophy, they .will cease to interest or in-\nnuence man. They have no point ot con-\ntact with his interests. But men are in-\nterested in religion. This very question-\ning and unrest proves.it. Even the return\nto paganism, as it has been called, that\ntrend, narticularly noticeable in rural New\nEngland, away from the formalism of the\nchurch and back to nature, it not so\nalarming as appears at first glance. We\nare learning to see that, although for cen\nturies we .have called certain peoples "pa-\ngans, thinning to give them a Dad name\nand so to avoid more tedious investigation\ninto the character of these same pagans,\ntiro Iio-ito :tyi,tVi f rk Ian rn mTimit TAlienr.Ti arH\nwe may not seldom sit with profit at the\nteet ot many a pagan prophet. Men are\nasking whether, after all. a comparatively\nemail sect is right and all the rest wrong,\nor whether there is, not a bit of truth in\nthem all. They go further. They ask\nnow whether that truth may not make al\npeoples free; they are wondering whether,\nafter all, salvation is to be found with one\nand universal destruction with the other,\nwuclllcr tile Vicatui: ui air uauuua . la , u&c-\nly to make one of them His favorite, to\ngive that one a true and final revelation\nand to withhold it trom all others. Men\nare going even further than this in their\nquestioning. They are putting the relig\nionsiside by side for comparison. They\nare inquiring whether or not the truth\nthat is in one may not be found occasion\nally in another, and they are finding\nthrough this comparative study of relig\nions that, at bottom, all are alike. Ureal\nareas of parallel beliefs and aspirations are\nfound making the claim of exclusive reve\nlation ridiculous. In tact, when it t is\nfound that\' every single form of religion\non the face of the earth lays claim to an\nexclusive revelation of some sort, and we\nfind that the term "heretic" is merely an\nexpression of one man\'s, or group of men\'s,\npoint of view, we begin to open our eyes\nto the fact that our own past claims in the\nmatter may not carry so much weight as\nwe had thought.\n-The discoveries that we have made dm\ning the last century about the habits of\nlife and the character - of thought Of the\nother half of the world, the scientific meth-\nods of investigation into the subject of re-\nligion, it origin, rise and often its.de-\ncav. into religious literatures, and among\nthem our own Bible, are broadening in\nview, even while, and perhaps because,\nthey disturb bur complacency. Religion is\ngiven a new interest. We nnd that we\nChristians are not the only members of\nGod\'s family, and that there are others\nwho care for Him as much as we do and\nwhom He loves as greatly as He loves us\nI say that this is the tendency of men\'s\nminds to-dav. Hardly do the most of us\nadmit the changed point of view as - an\naccomplished iact, even to ourselves, and\nin many localities the old exclusivenesa is\nas impenetrable as ever it Was in the dark\nages. Universally, wnere religious exclu\nsiveness is found it is accompanied; bred\nand safeguarded by some form of claims to\nfinal revelation or final authority for truth\nsome artificial guarantee that the doc\ntrine preached in that church in the be\nginning is now and ever shall be preached\nwithout change,, world without. end.,.That\nsuch claim is manifestly impassible to sub\nstantiate has never deterred the church\nfrom making it. It is one recognition\nthough a weak one that absolute truth\nis unchangeable, and every religion and\nevery church that claims to . have a final\nand true revelation must, of course, claim\nto possess a knowledge of that absolute\nwhich SDencer calls "unknowable." Not\none such body could step forth boldly and\nlav hold on the great athrmation of to-day.\nthat the faith of to-day is but the stepping\nstone to the taith ot to-morrow; that rev\nelation is not sealed: that truth is a liv\ning thing, growing as wc grow; that man\nkind is saved through perpetual evolu\ntion from lower to higher, or, in- other\nwords, by fulfilling one meted destiny of\nDscommg penecx; as me xatner in neaven\nis perfect. Our business to-day is frankly\nto admit that the hnal revelation is yet\nfai rtff nnd that. Wf have Viv Tin mMno\nfound the "absolute" truth. The know!\n4ge, of to-day is but a little section of that\niJ,iVL JK&\nthat we are here to enlarge. :.nd that we\naxe cuidignijj, tiiat section oj imowieuge.\nj. iitfve saia mat wnavever religious ex\nclusiveness is found it is accompanied by\nI l r i t :i . i m\nauiue is. in (j oi autnonty pin-porung: io guar\nantee the permanency and. integrity of its\nfaith, j The creed has been changed from\nits original meaning "credo, I believe"\nFrom being tt simple statement of an indi\nvidual faith it has become a formal state\nment of a sys.tem of dogma to which all\nwho would be saved must subscribe. No\nlatitude is allowed for " individual \' inter-\npretations or-for the growth of religious\nand theological conceptions. The aim in\nsimply to lay down a body of dogma that\nembodies final truth, and a confession t\nwnicn tne wnpie world must subscribe re\ngardless of individual reason: and. unaf- "\niected by the growth of knowledge and\nmoral consciousness. The attempt has al\nways failed. There is no creed that holds\nthe same, meaning for us to-day which it\nheld for mankind a century ago. If it i\nnot now actually changed in form, as in\nthe case of a notable number, it is changed\nin content to the minds of its adherents.\nIf we are but willing to onen our eves we\nshall find that there are hundreds of mean\nof salvation, and each method breeds a\nsect. Jiut what does the method signify\nbeside the tremendous ultimate fact that\nall the world is looking for salvation?\nHere is the universal and permanent thing.\nin some way the truth has percolated\nI through every mind that we are put into\n11\' t 1 J.J ITT\nthis world in order to grow. We are not\nuniversally interested in speculations about\nNirvana, or about atonements, or about\nthe "survival . of the fittest." nor in the\ndiscussion as to the proper aim. whether.\nfor happiness or virtue. Perhaps every\none is interested in one or another of\nthese means to the end, but we are all in\nterested in the outcome salvation for the\nhuman race. It is a universal longing. It\nI is one of the permanent things of religion\nThen mankind .has been universally in\nterested in another thing the incarnation.\nEver since man became man and learned\nthat there was a power outside of himself\nto which he was bound, he has thought of\nthis power as in some waytentering into\nand becoming the guiding power of some\' (\nobject of the visible world. At first it\nwas a mere stick or stone,, a tree or river\nor wild beast that was the chosen dwelling\nI place of deity. Then in good time the feel\ning grew-that none but man -would make a\nJ suitable habitation for the Creator; so we\nhear of the Greek heroes, "descendants of\nthe gods," oi Druidic and Delphic oracles\nand of prophets in all lands whose speech\nwas controlled in an especial way by Deity.\nWe hear of a perfect incarnation of Deity\nin .Buddha, born of a virgin, with his di\nvine parentage attested; by miracles of va\nrious kinds, and teaching that there are\nmany incarnations similar, to his own:\nthat whenever the, world has advanced to\n1 a condition in which its needs are different\nI from the old, God incarnates Himself in &\nI mortal, who thereupon becomes a great\n1 leaaer and propnet. twr minds, or course,\nI now revert to another incarnation, that of\n1 God in Jesus, who also taught that there\nI are many incarnations; who prayed that\nwis disciples might be one with God as He\nHimself was one with Him. And again we\nsee the tendency of men to obscure the\ngreat truth by the particular example. The\ntruth which has most obviously appealed\nto men is the incarnation of God in a sin\ngle man, or, formerly, in a class of men,,\nas prophets or priests. The truth of that\nendures, and that has been pointed out\nby Jesus and all the greatest leaders of\nmen is that of perpetual and universal in-\ni carnation, uoa nas oreatned the breath ot\nlife and has lit the spark of divinity in\nmankind, tor we are His children, made in,\nI TTis TTinral imntrf inlipritnia nf TTic I itt-iti If tj\nI because we are natural sons and heirs.\nI his is the tremendous fact toward which\nI the world is groping.\' It explains the now\nI proven fact that mankind\'s trend is up-\nward rather than downward.- It gives us\nthe courage for going on. for keening ut\ntne struggle when to our restricted view\ntne oostacies seem insuperable, it com\npels us to believe that this world is found-\nI ed upon good, that\' the good is "hastening\nvij. iuaiu zxxi.iiiuxiiautv, tvxiuc cvxx is scil\ndestruction.. If j"God\'s in His heaven,"\nGod\'s in His world as well, the guarantor\n01 its lunaamentai integrity, the inspirer\nof every good thing in the heart of man.\nUo you not see how intimately connected\nare the two ideas, the incarnation of God\nand the divinity of man? Both ideas are\neverywhere recurrent in the theologies of\nthe world, though their particular expres\nsion in. one faith is utterly different from\nthat m another, and it is the difference in\nthe isolated expressions of the truth that\nkeeps men apart. The permanent thing,\nthe larger truth must wait upon our fur\nther enlightenment and . broadening of view\nbefore it can bring us together. We are\nlearning, it . is true. The existence of an.\nunwonted spirit of toleration and unitv in\nreligion, the modern armation of the\nuniversality of spirit shows that we are\ncatching some glimpses of the larger truth\nthat lies behind our incarnations and\natonements, our theophanies and oracles,\nour Buddhas and Jesus of past time. H\nwe had heard the real message of Jesus and\nthe prophets and poets we should long ago\nhave discovered this truth. To be a man\nis to be a descendant of God, to be a de-\nscendant of, God is to be His prophet, Hia\nincarnation, the inheritor of His divinitvi\nthis! is the larger permanent truth, one\nwhich is prepared for by every religion\nthat the world has ever known.\nAfter having agreed that to do right 5\nthe end of conduct, can we not take each\nother bytb.e hand in the fellowship of that\nprofession, even: though we may differ as\nto the adoption of means to that end? If\nwe all recognize the fact that the salvation\nof humanity is the permanent object of all\nreligious effort, then our various methods\nof attaining salvation will soon take their\nproper places as subordinate elements of\nfaith and variable according as the needs\nof men vary. The creed then will be not\na Shibboleth by which tosave one and to\nexclude another, but a covenant of kindred\nminds bent upon a common\' object and\ndrawn together by the natural sympathy\nof similar beliefs. Religion will be ne\nlonger made up of religions some false,\nsome true but will be recognized as fun\ndamentally a, unit wherever man has lifted\nup his head and called on the power that\nis above him. Weshall see that the essen\ntial elements of religion are not the differ\nences that divide, they are the permanent\nand fundamental things upon which all\nforms of religion are founded, and. which,\nif we but let them, will unite men in the\nsympathy of common aspirations and in\nspirations. - The Alloy of Self.\nAchievement fused with self is too brittle\nto stand the test of time.

After nineteen days treatment\nI menstruated without suffering the\nagonies I usually did and soon became\nregular and. .without pain. Wine of\nOardui is sfmty wonderful and I wish\nthat all suffering women knew of its\ngood qualities.\nS.TMt I\nTreasurer, Portland Eoonomio League\n. Periodical headaches tell of fe\nmale weafcdess. Wine of Cardui\ncures permanently nineteen out of\neTery twenty cases of - irregular\nmenses, hearing down pains or.\naAy female weakness. \' If you are\ndiscouraged and doctors have\nfailed, that is the best reason in\nthe world you should try Wine of\nCardui now.

In speaking ot countries, territo\nries or divisions of lands. , it is ens\nfotnary, however, \'to tell tbeir pOsi\ntions, be nee it will be. customary to\ntell the position of our people on\nthe school ; tqud. How shall we\nutilize the negro? \'Hie education\nof whVte child is not suited ;f or trie\nnegro. This system has ; -been .in\nvogue\'for a long time and fabolpos\nsouis of money amounting to mil\nlions of dollars have been ftperit,. and\nwiin wnai results r wo reason ap\nexpected educational facilities an\nexamples of whites would improve\nthe morals of the negro, make him a\nbetter neighbor, or better citfeen,\nall have failed and that most com\npletely, I am Borry to confess. It is\naxiom, a self evident fact, neittver\nadmitting or requiring any demon\nstration, that; he is more \'criminal\n(brutish) as a free negro tlraii as a\nslave, and. his brntishness is alarm\ningly increasing. ; These are start\nling facts und are revealed by the\ncensus, that the educated blacks are\nmore criminal, which is not so with\nthe whites. The pages ot our news\npapers co me black .with their con\nsummate villainy and unmentionable\n\'crimes, and this\' is the aspiration of\n-cuffee lor social , equality, placed in\nbis pram by education, and our law\nframers are piling the tax lipon us,\nand equally divides the money with\ncuffee, to fill him with the ideas of\nequality. 1 &dmit there afe sbme\nmixed breeds who are not responsi\nble at all lor the disboilion of\n(cuffee) or their race. Thexpeople\nwant and Vay a change is sadly\nwanted. Oar State at great expense\nhas 8opporCed this system of ednoa\ntion, and I denounce the perpetra\ntion of such a course. So far as we\nhave gone with coffee a Criminal is\nthe consequence. We have de\nstroyed every vestige of his useful\nnees 8 a laborer. A proper knowl\nedge ot cuffee would suggest a rem\nedy \'from l he fertile brain ot our law\nsoloes, to educate his hand, as they\nhave failed on the head (or brain.)\nThere roust be another plane to\nbuild on or he will never make a\nuseful snbject. He never felt the\nguilt of sin or. the ledeeming influ\nence of moral scruples, or the inflo\neuce ot an outrage! conscience.\nBy the mode of slavery lie was part\nly civilized, fie was treated lor a\nmenial. Take him from ourfer the\ninfluence of tb white i ace and he\nwill push baok to barbarism and his\nnative jungles. There are some who\nmight aspire above their position,\nand that is all he will ever do. Our\nrace, the Anglo Saxon, the chivalry\nof the Southland, born and tiogh. to\nrule, wift never share sovereignty or\ndominion with him. Divide the\nschool fund. Put cuffee on his own\nresources and perhaps be will thank\nus for having more: brains than\nmoney. Whs.t are we educating the\nnegro for ? We have eliminated\nhim from the polls. We: educate\nthe whil\'e children tha, they may\nhasten out into the world, hoping\n1)kbts. .....\nThe Progressive \'Farmer quotes\nMr. P. M.

I had ex\ntremely bad luck, and secured a seat\nclear around next to the wall on the\nleft of the Speaker. I was just think\ning that I was mightly unlucky when I\nlooked across the hall and near the\ncentre aisle there was a head just vis\nible above the railing that separated\nthe seats from the rear space. It was\na most disconsolate face that, peered\nover the railing and scanned the\nHouse, and I recognized the man that\nI had beaten for the nomination and\nsucceeded. \'I\'ll bet that fellow,\' said\nI to myself, \'would be mighty well sat\nisfied with any seat in this House,\'\nand at once ceased to feel very sore\nover my luck.
