H.\nPotter in which the Judge held that\nGovernor Russell had the right to re\nmove State Insurance Commissioner\nThomas M. Henry for alleged em\nbezzlement. Henry appealed to the\nSupreme Court from the decision of\nJudge Potter, and as this a state\nmatter, it will perhaps be made a pre\nference case and be decided of Judge\nPotter, Henry will be out of office,\nand Excell Coody, whom the governor\nappointed when he issued his remov\nal order, will become Insurance Com\nmissioner, and hold under such ap\npointment until January 1924, when\nCoody’s successor, who will be nomi\nnated In the August primary of 1923,\nand elected the following November,\nwill be sworn in for four years.\nCommissioner Henry’s removal by\nthe governor is the result of his hav\ning been checked short on premium\ntaxes collected, some $40,000 by State\nRevenue Agent Stokes V. Robertson.\nHenry paid into the state treasury\nthrough the State Revenue Agent\nsome $30,000 and is being sued by the\nState Revenue Agent in the name of\nthe state, for an addltonal $10,000 in\nthe chancery court of this district, of\nwhich V.

Austin of\nJackson, insurance agents, and are\nBald to contain the names of some\n11,000 signers. The challenge of the\nrevenue agent charges" that the intii\native petitions were obtained by fraud\nand misrepresentation, that many sig\nnatures were forged, some of said sig\nnatures being forged in the presence\nof circulators of the petition.” The\ncharges made that some corporations\nsighed the petitions, and that a large\nnumber of persons affixed their signa\nJohn H. Cook, who recently announ\nced as the Republican candidate for\nthe United States Senate, has been on\na visit to Jackson.

The Revenue Agent also says\n“that the sponsors counted signatures\nof persons who are not qualified elect\nors of the state.” and he furthe^says\n"that the affidavits of many of the cir\nculators of the petitions are untrue.”\nThe affidavit of each circulator that\nthe signatures to the lnitatlve peti\ntions were affixed in the presence of\nthe circulator, and that such signa\ntures was genuine and that of a quali\nfied elector.

J.—"A Jealous\nwoman killed my mom and Mr. Hall.”\nWith this thinly veiled accusation\nconfirming the present belief or au\nthorities, Charlotte Mills, the mystery\ngirl, whom many believe holds the key\nto the solution of the Hall-Mills mur\nders last Thursday night, unlocked her\nlips for the first time in an interview\nwith the Universal Service.\nCharlotte, who is only 15 years old,\ndiscussed her opinions on the shoot\ning of her mother, Mrs. Eleanor Mills,\nchoir leader, and the Rev. Edward\nHall, rector of the Church of St. John\nthe Evangelist here. Charlotte said:\n“I know a woman did it. That wo\nman was one who was Jealous and\nwanted revenge. My mother was one\nwho, if accused of anything and knew\nshe was innocent, would fight all she\ncould. But she weighed only 118\npounds, exactly my own weight, and\nshe was very weak.\n“The woman who I think killed my\nmom and Mr. Hall is three times\nas strong as my mom---mother didn’t\nhave a chance. This woman isn’t like\nordinary folks. She has funny eyes\nthat make you afraid of her—sort of\nlike a man\'s. She hates young peo\nple and looks on poor people as scum,\nbut she pretentds she has great sym\npathy for them.”\nThe girl’s suspicions and reasons\nfor them are known to the authorities\nand they have under consideration the\nissuance of a grand Jury subpoena to\nthe two hundred members of the\nchurch congregation. Charlotte added:\n“Why don’t the authorities get Mrs.\nHalf’s story. All of it? For instance,\nwhen Mrs. Hall told father that Mr.\nHall had disappeared, father asked her\nwhether Mr. Hall had taken any money\nout of the bank. Later Mrs. Hall told\nmy fafcher that Mr. Hall had not taken\nany money out of the bank. Later Mrs.\nHall told my father that Mr. Hall had\nnot taken out any money. That an\nswers Mrs. Hall’s guess that her hus\nband may have been killed by robbers\nfor money he carried.\n“Mom liked Mrs. Hall. I didn’t.\nMrs. Hall doesn’t like flowers and I\nguess I am one. I know there was\nnothing wrong between my mom and\nMr. Hall, except that she helped him\na lot on his sermons. Mom did a lot\nof work a pastor’s wdfe usually does.\nMaybe somerone connected with the\nchurch was jealous because of this.\n*1 know there Is no ground for Mrs.\nHall s suspicions, if she has any. My\nmother may have been romantic, but\nher character was beyond reproach."\nAnother matter of keenest official\nscrutiny Is a story told by Mrs. Au\nguste Tennison, a sister of Mrs. Mills,\nthat after a tea party at the rector’s\nhome last June, Mrs. Mills complained\nof being seriously ill. Mrs. Tennison\nsaid:\n“My sister told me that the coffee\nshe drank at the party tasted so\nqueerly that she could only drink part\nof it. She left the party ill and went\nhome. She told me she was not sure\nMrs. Hall was such a good friend ol\nhers.”\nLorimer, Recovers.\nChicago.-William Lorimer, former\nUnited States senator from Illinois,\nwho underwent an operation for an\nailment of his eyes several weeks\nago, has completely recovered and\nplans a return to South America as\nrepresentative of a syndicate of In\nvestors.

Davis suddenly banked his ma\nchine in preparation for landing. At\nthe top of the bank, when the wings\nof the plane were almost perpendicu\nlar, the bomber suddenly side-slipped\nand fell. A yellow flash of light cut the\ndark for a moment as every infamma\nble object on the plane burned. The\nbomber struck the ground with her\ntwx> motors wide open.\nThree of the bodies had been thrown\nclear of the wreckage. W\'hen the first\narmy surgeon reached the scene two of\nthe men wore breathing. They died\nbefore reaching the army hospital.\nExplaining the application of the\nterm, "Btowaway," to Private Whit\nney, it was said that there are any\nnumber of privates and noncommis\nsioned officers stationed at the flying\nfield who have never had time in the\nservice in the belief that flying would\nbecome an every-day occurrence in\ntheir lives. When they found Instead,\nthat their lives were filled from rev\neille to taps with an endess round of\nhum-drum details, which seldom takes\nthem inside an airplane hangar, no op\nportunity is lost of “going up.” Whit\nney, it is believed, hopped into the\nplane in the last minute and during\nthe excitement of taking off.\nLiberty Goddess Symbol.\nSc.

The Parent* of John the Baptist\n(vv. 5-7).\n1. When They Lived (v. 5). “In th®\ndays of Herod the King.” They lived\nin a day when ungodliness was rife.\nThe priesthood was very corrupt and\nthe ruling classes were wicked. Zach\narias and his wife lived in a time\nwhen It was not so easy to be godly.\n2. Tlielr Character (v. 6). They\nwere righteous before God. To b*\nrighteous before God Is a high tribute.\nMany appear to be righteous befor®\nmen who are not righteous Derore ooo.\nTheir lives were so mated that they\nwalked in ihe commandments of the\nLord blameless. How beautiful It Is\nwhen husband and wife are united tn\nthe Lord and walk together In fellow\nship with God.\n3. They Were Childless (v. 7).\nThough this godly couple were well\nmated find they possessed the Joy of\nthe Lord In their souls, there was a\nreal lack In that home.\nII. The Birth of John Promised (vr.\n8-17).\n1. By Whom (v. 11; cf. v. 19). The\nntigel Gabriel appeared and made\nknown the good news to Zaeharlas.\nThis exalted being, the special mes\nsenger of God, was sent to make thla\ndisclosure.\n2. When (vv. 8-14). While officiat\ning as priest this good news came to\nhim. Zaeharlas must have been defi\nnitely praying about this very matter\n(v. 13). As he burned Incense, which\ntypified prayer, the multitude without\nwere praying.\n3. Characteristics of the Child (vr.\n15-17). (1) Shall be great In the sight\nof the Lord (v. 15). Though the\npeople did not greatly esteem him he\nwas highly esteemed by the Lord. Tbl»\nIs Infinitely better than If he had been\ngreatly esteemed In the eyes of men\nor in his own eyes. This Is the esteem\nfor which we all should long and pray.\n(2) Shall drink neither wine nor\nstrong drink (v. 15). The child shall\nbecome a Nazurite, separating him\nself from the sensuous things and ded\nicating himself to the service of the\nLord. (3) Be filled with the Holy\nGhost (v. 15). The energy of the di\nvine Spirit would enable him to lead\nthe people to repentance (v. 16).\n(4) Shall go In the spirit and power\nof Elijah (v. 17). In this power he\nwas to prepare the people for the\ncoming of the Savior and the salva\nuon wnicn tie was to nring.\nill. Zacharias Asking for a Sign\n(vv. 18-23).\nAlthough the aged priest was ear\nnestly praying for the salvation of\nIsrael the gracious promise of the\nangel, which was the beginning of that\nsalvation, staggered his faith. He was\nunable to believe that that for which\nhe fondly hoped and prayed would be\nrealized. The ungel gave Zacharias a\nI sign. He was smitten with dumbness\nwhich was to continue until the ful\nfillment of the promise.

Some are\nopenly advocating its entire repeal.\nThe Herald advocated the passage\nof the Absentee Voting Law. In\nfact we fuvored such a provision\neven before the Soldier Voting Law\n—forerunner to present Absentee\nVoters Law—wits passed, Such pro\ntisiuus mi vuviiig necessarily arc mini\nto contrive in a way to entirely elim\ninate cheating or manipulations in\nfavor of some one side or candidate,\nbut we believe that its weak points\nlike many other new laws, will have\nbeen manifested from its operation\nand can be cured or made nearer per\nfect at the next session of the Legis\nlature after which if it does not\nprove desirable under further trial\nit can then be abolished, but lets\ngive it a thorough trial and attempt\nmending it to offset any defects be\nfore wholly casting it aside.\nThe Woman Voter is the name of\na new publication in Mississippi. It\nstarted on August 3, 1922. Is edited\nby Miss Minnie Brewer who is a\ndaughtir of Ex-Gov. Earl Brewer.\nIt is published in Clarksdale, which\nis the home town of the Brewers.\nBrewer is a great hater of Vardaman\nand Russell and a leader among the\nantis. We are of the opinion that\ndespite its claims to being non-par\ntisan that this is rather a clever\nmove to attempt to corral the women\nvote for the antis in the coming cam\npaigns. However, we must sav that\nMiss brewer is proving a good wri\nter and has been fair to both factions\nin the way of accepting “paid adver\ntisements” for both Vardaman and\nStephens in the late campaign. If\nshe preserves that attitude and does\nnot permit a series of veiled propa\nganda to trickle through her columns\nagainst the Vardaman faction her\nperiodicarwill come near being view\ned with favor by the women voters\nin that camp, otherwise they shall\nlook toother quarters to secure their\npolitical pabulum even in the inter\nest of their sex in exercise of the\nfranchise.\nHow Good a Ci tizeu are you ?\nHave you courage to join a small\nbut unpopular minority when\nconvinced that they are right.—\nColumbus Commercial-Dispatch.\nThe above question is one which\nshould greet the mind of all good\ncitizens and receive an affirmative\nanswer. But can it? Tbe Herald\nman has seen it fail. There are\ntome who can face a tight issue when\nits temporarily unpopular but a\ngreater number who quail in the face\nof majority disapproval. Twas the\ngreat English writer Ambassador\nBryce, who said of America that.\n"Popular Opinion was the uncrown\ned king" and how true it is that\nthere are but few who can face its\nnegative side but who bellow long\nand loud when they prance up to fall\nin line with it on a question which\nis one where the sceptre is extended\napprovingly. Well its probably not\noest to expect too much of some,\nwhile there are others who have suf\nficient iron In their nature to stand\nto the rack fodder or no fodder. A\ncountry ia always blessed io having\na few of that kiod who will stand out\nthough the heavens fall for what\ntbev conceive to be the right even if\nthe populace clamor as they did\nagainst Jesus,\\"Crucify him, Crucify \'\nhim,” etc. |\n■• !\nTaylorviP© Signal.\nWhile the old political coat tad\nhas been cut. shorter in the State it\nremains about the same in Smith\nCounty.\nBoonevtlle Advocate.\nThough it. is claimed that the s\', la\nrit\'S of public officials are much too\nlow, the tnaj irtty of them will lie\nbustling fur rcelerti a, next v ur.\nCarthage Carthaginian.\nLet polities rest for a season and\nspend your energy building up your\ncounty and slate.

Women may purify poli\nties with the ballot, but they can’t\npurify society with eat-o’-nine-tuils.\nStuff Published Aeainst Vardaman\nPurely To Poison Peoples Minds.\nPass Christian Beacon.\nHubert D. Stephens received a\nmajority over J. K. Vardaman for\nthe Democratic nomination Tor Uni\nted States Senator, and as such is\nentitled to the United support of Hie\nentire Democratic voting strength\nof Mississippi. The campaign was\none of Mississippi. The campaign\nwas one of the most holly contested\nand one of the bitterest ever held\nin this Slate, where factional Politics\nare extremely bitter. No limit was\nregarded as to what was said by the\nleaders and papers on both sides,\nand the Stephens faction was able to\ngive more publicity to the most lies\nwas because they had with them the\ngreatest number of newspapers,\nmany of whom did not hesitate to\nprint rbso’.utely false statements,\nwhen they had every opportunity to\nknow or learn the truth. There is\nnot a single fair-minded man or wo\nman in the Stephens faction today\nwho honestly believes that James K.\nVardaman is not as loyal and as true\nDemocrat as any rnan who voted a\ngainst him. They all kn iw that\nwhat was published against him was\npurely for political effect to poison 1\nthe minds of tne people lr. the hope\nof turning them to Mr. Stephens, 1\nand this was accomplished as the re- ‘\nsuit shows.\n-o-£\nFORK OF RIVERS. *\nLeakesville, R-A, Miss.

Desecration of the last\ngreat “forest primeval ’ is impending.\nLumbermen of the country see In\nthe brief statement of the service the\nfinal opportunity for their trade to\ndeal initially with a virgin pine forest\nof wide expanse and the last oppor\ntunity for the settler to take posses\nsion of a region now remote from\nrailways and markets and virtually\nuuused agriculturally.\nHuge Timber Tract.\nThe opeuiug for sale of the timber\nof the Bear valley uuir of the Malheur\nnationul forest u fleets approximately\nSbO.tXJO.OOO feet of Blue mountains tim\nber now und murks the beginning of the\nrazing of the entire forest, containing\nmure tliun 7,000,000,000 feet of lumber.\nTo start the lumbering operations it\nWill be necessary to build ubout 80\ntulles of trunk Hue rallwuy. In addition\nto tap Hues, thus opening incidentally\nfor settlement an agricultural country\nLaving an urea of 10,000 square miles,\nor ubout twice thut of the stute of\nMassachusetts.\nThe agricultural development that\nwill ensue upon the lumbering activi\nties, which Involve the employment of\nhundreds of men In building of ueces\nSury railway alone, will demonstrate\nAlso exceptionally the policy of using\nthe national forests as an adjunct of\nthe general progress and welfare of\nAdjacent regions. The forecast of the\nforest service provides for ut least one\nlogging and lumbering unit that will\nnever have to move elsewhere to Hud\nnew forests—at least one sawmill town\nthat will never die for lack of material\nfor Its Industries.\nThe mill site recommended Is at\nBurns, Ore., a village of ubout 1,000\npersons, located 30 miles northwest of\nCrane, the present terminus of a\nbranch of the Oregon Short Idne of\nthe Union Pacltic railway, which leaves\nthe main line at Ontario. Ore. It Is\nlikely that the Union Pacific would un\ndertake to build a branch from Crane\nto Burns If u sawmill were put In oper\nation nt the latter place, it Is suid.\nFrom Burns on, however, whoever\nbuys the timber will have to build a\nlogging railway, which Is required to\nbe a common carrier, for a distance of\n60 miles to Senoca. The country Is\nopen and with easy slopes, extremely\nwell adapted to economical logging and\neasy railway construction.\nIt Is estimated that, exclusive of the\nHue from Crnne to Burns, whoever\ntakes this timber will have to expend\napproximately $3,000,000 In railway\nbuilding, mill construction and operat\ning expenses for the first year. Be\ncause of the lack of railways there are\n10,000 square miles of land In Harney,\nGrant and Cook counties almost en\ntirely given over now to grazing. The\nfew natives of this section contend\nthat their community, from a settle\nment point of view, Is the last frontier\nIn the United States.\nA Long-Time Contract.\nWhile the ancient forest Is doomed,\nthe terms of the proposed sale are\nsuch that the succession of Its sylvan\nposterity Is assured, according to the\nNational Lumber Manufacturers’ asso\nciation. Though the timber now of\nfered for sale by the forest service Is\nsufficient only to keep a moderate\nsized mill running continuously for 20\nyears, the service will at the end of\nthat time open up another unit and\nso on until eventually 7,000,000,000 feet\nof timber will be made available.\nThe unit It Is now planned to open\nIs 87 per cent western yellow pine.\nThe minimum price the forest service\nwill consider for the pine In the Initial\nunit Is $2.75 a thousand nnd 50 cents\nfor timber of other species, although\nlogging tlie latter will be optlonnl with\nthe contractor. It is stipulated that\nthe mill must be In operation by April\n1, 1028, nnd that stumpnge prices will\nbe readjusted every three years there\nafter.\nBetter Traveling Agente Needed.\n‘‘Careful selection of efficient travel\ning agents for service abroad Is\none of the most vital essentials\nfor success In our foreign business,”\ngays Jullua Klein, director of the\nbureuu of foreign and domestic com\nmerce, after summarizing a coiu\nnrehenslve survey of the situation\n.-. . -- u.\nmade by experts of the Department of\nCommerce throughout the world.\nHe points out that extreme cart\nmust be exercised, particularly at this\ncrucial period of reconstruction, lest\nan unwise appointment might bring\ndisaster, not only to the individual\nmerchant who sent him overseus, but\nmight Involve also the good will and\nstanding of American export firms In\ngeneral. The traveling representative\nhas an unprecedentedly grave re\nsponsibility, since he will be regarded\nas the spokesman of his country as\nwell as of his company. He will be In\na position to build up or damage the\nprestige of both.\nThe Department of Commerce Is\ngiving considerable attention to\nmeasures designed to facilitate the\nwork of American salesmen abroad,\nparticularly in the Latln-Amerlcan\ncountries. A bill Is now before con\ngress to give effect to the uniform\ncommercial-traveler treaty, which has\nalready been ratified by seven of the\nLatln-Amerlcan republics. By the\nterms of this treaty commercial trav\nelers of one country\' will be able to op\nerate In the territory of another simply\nupon the payment of a single fee and\nobtaining a license, which Is valid\nthroughout the whole country.\nKind of Mari Required.\nThe Department of Commerce will\nIssue to American travelers the certifi\ncates of identification called for by the\nconvention, and It is because the de\npartment realizes the Implied respon\nsibility of promoting the selection of\nproper American salesmen to repre\nsent American business In foreign\ncountries that Director Klein feels It\nImperative to admonish those execu\ntives who pick men to see that they\nare (a) suited to the territory and the\ntrade to be visited; (b) to the line of\ngoods he handles, and (c) to -the com\nmercial policies of his employer.\nThe agent should be a mun of good\neducation, thoroughly versed In the\nfundamental technical aspects of his\nfield. He should possess u broad fund\nof Information, with at least u super\nficial knowledge of the topics of the\nday.\nStability of mornl character Is an\nIndispensable requirement. No mat\nter how brilliant he may be as a\nsalesman, If his moral character is\nquestioned by a foreign merchant this\nwill reflect upon his manufacturer\nand upon Ills country. No weuk\nwllled person should be sent abroad\non a business mission. Much more\nattention should be paid to his per\nsonal habits than If he wus to work\nIn the United States.\nReliability In the broadest sense 19\na primary requisite. The overseas\nsalesman is lurgely “on his own”;\nIlls house must depend upon his dis\ncretion ; he cannot be watched und\nguided as a domestic counterpart\nShould Be a Good “Mixer.”\nTo be u good “mixer" is highly de\nsirable If coupled with restraint und\nproper standards of behavior. The\ntraveling agent should be u student\nof human nuture, with ability to adopt\nhimself to the persons with whom he\ncomes in contact. Abroad, he will\nAnd the sodul obligations of his posi\ntion much more exacting than In the\nUnited States. He should curb any\ntendency to boastfulness about him\nself or the United Stutes, and guard\nagainst criticisms which might offend\nthe sensibilities of foreigners. He\nshould remember that he was sent out\nus u saelsman—not as a reformer.\nTact and politeness are Indispens\nable. Lack of tact has been one of\nthe outstanding deficiencies of Ameri\ncan traveling men. The bluff, good\nfellowship In this country Is very dis\ntasteful to the Latin American, who\nIs accustomed to well phrased compli\nments and strict observance of certain\nconventions. The Lutiu American also\ndislikes the appearance of doing busi\nness in a hurry.\nThe question of the salesman’s na\nfirru.utv la unite imuortant He must\nbe a reul American. Wlien n natural\nized American is being considered for\nassignment as foreign salesman, ills\nstanding before naturalization and in\nhis native country must be able to\nstand the closest scrutiny. Foreign\nbuyers will make allowances for out\nand-out Americans that they will not\nmake for natives of their own coun\ntry who may have become naturalized\nin this country. The foreign buyers\nhave a pretty fair idea of the typical\nAmerican, and like to do business with\nhim.\nThe representative for foreign serv\nice should have a well-balanced com\nprehension of sales problems and a\npsychological understanding of the buy\ners\' position—not be a mere “order\ntaker.”\nProbably a Medley.\nThe members of a Sunday school\norchestra in n smnll Indiana town\nfound themselves in sudden need of\nsome music for church and other oc\ncasions. so they wrote to a city depart\nment store (one of those which prides\nitaelf on super-service) asking for sev\neral numbers suitable for the use of a\nSunday school orchestra. When the\nmusic came the first piece opened was\n"Angel Child” (fox trot).

Is not important. Down\nthe Rhine, below where Caesar bridged\nit at Andernach, below where Yankee\ndoughboys now wash their shirts in\nits green flood and British Tommies\nplay at soccer above the bones of bish\nops, the small crooked stream flows in\nfrom the east. But it flows through\nand lends its nnme to a tiny regiou\nnot equaled anywhere for Intensity of\nIndustry and potential political impor\ntance.\nViewed in the light of events since\nthe war, it seems safe to predict that\nthe course of life in Europe for the\nnext generation may depend on whut\nis happening now along this short,\ncrooked,- but busy stream.\nThe Ruhr, as this famous region is\ncommonly called, is not a political sub\ndivision of Germany; it is merely an\nindustrial district, smaller in area than\nRhode Island, but crowded with mines\nund factories from end to end and\nsettled, in spots, with 1,800 people to\nthe squnre mile.\nTiny as it is, a mere speck on the\nmap, it produces in normal times over\n100,000,000 tons of coal a year; it\nmines much of the iron ore its many\nmills consume, and the steel wares of\nSolingen have been famous since the\nMiddle agea\nFrom Essen there is trundled out,\nmonth after month, a parade of fin\nished engines, curs, and farm Imple\nments, to say nothing of tools, shaft\ning, ship-frames, bridge steel, and\nplates, that compete in the markets\nof the world from Javu to Jerusalem.\nOne German writer, with character\nistic rucinl precision, figures out that\ntlie volume of raw and finished prod\nucts handled in the Ruhr every work\nj ing day would load a train of cars\n80 miles long!\nWhat the Ruhr Is Like.\nTo grasp quickly just what the Ruhr\nwould look like if painted in on a\nmap, take your pencil and draw a\nhorseshoe-slmped figure, starting north\neast from Duisburg, on the Rhine; then\ndustrial region Is even larger than\nthe mining area, for It overflows to the\nsouthwest and Includes the famous\nfactory towns of Barmen, Elberfeld\nand Sollngen.\nEssen’s Sudden Rise.\n“Boom” towns of mushroom growth\nare not peculiar to America, ns the\nstartling rise of Essen proves. Though\nfounded away back In the Ninth cen\ntury, It slumbered along for hundreds\nof years, un obscure, unimportant ham\nlet. Even as late as 1850 It had hard\nly more than 10,000 people. Then the\nKrupp boom—the rise of the greatest\nmachine shop the world has ever seen\n—struck it, and today the city houses\nhalf a million.\nSet In the heart of the coal fields,\ncrowded with endless Industrial plants\nwhose tall chimneys belch eternal\nsmoke and fumes, the great workshop\nfairly throbs with power and energy.\nThe roar and ruttle of ceaseless wheels\nand the din of giant hammers pound\ning on metal seem to keep the whole\ntown ntremble.\nHere every form of Iron and steel\nnrtlole Is made, from boys\' skates to\ngiant marine engine shafts. Curious\nly enough, even some of the smoke,\nor the fumes from the smokestacks,\nIs caught and converted Into a gas\nthat furnishes more power to run the\nmills 1\nMore than a hundred years ago the\nfirst Krupp set up his small, crude\nshop and began to make by hand the\ntools, the drills and chisels, used by\ntanners, blucksmiths and carpenters\nalong the Ruhr and the Rhine. He al\nso made dies for use In the mint of\nthe government. Within 30 years, due\nto the) old ambition for expansion,\nKrupp tools were known and used as\nfar away as Greece and India.\nThen came the great era of mass\nproduction In steam engines, hammers,\nsteel tires for railway cars, cast-steel\nshafts for river and ocean steamers,\nand finally that astonishing output of\nguns and armor plate which brought\nthe militaristic nations of the world\nto buy at Essen.\nThe dally roar of artillery at the\nproving grounds, where each new gun\nwas tested, added to the din of\nwhistles, rushing trains, and rattling\ngears, made pre-war Ruhr probubly\nthe noisiest olnre on enrtli. It Is nnlsv\ncurve east and southeast, so that Dort\nmund stands at the toe of the shoe;\nthence south ut Hagen, southwest to\nBarmen, nnd thence straight on to\nstrike the Rhine again at a point north\nof Cologne.\nThen think of the Pennsylvania coal\nfields packed into this tiny nrea ; pour\nIn the combined populations of Phil\nadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland and St.\nLouis. Tlieji take n flock of the big\ngest American steel mills and railroad\nshops you can think of and set them\ndown along the Ruhr. Fill in the re\nmaining smaller gaps with paper, silk\nand cotton mills, glass factories, tan\nneries, dye, chemical and salt works.\nNow put every man, woman and child\nfrom the cities named hard at work\ndigging coal, firing boilers, running\nlathes or rolling steel rails, and you\nwill get a graphic, accurate mental\npicture of what this roaring, rushing\nRuhr really Is.\nGeographically, the Ruhr district\nlies chiefly in the province of West\nphalia. hounded on the west by the\nRhine. A small section of its area,\nhowever, Including the city of Essen,\nflows over Into the Rhine province.\nPhysically, It forms a part of tlie great\nsandy plain of northwest Germany,\nmerging with what geologists call the\n“Gulf of Cologne.” Its climate is mild\nly oceanic, with the heaviest rainfall\nIn July.\nPlunging suddenly Into this teeming\nIndustrial field on the train ride from\nCologne to Berlin, nnd passing through\nDusseldorf, where 150 trnins a day\npurr in and out, you ure amazed at the\nsolid procession of busy towns, at the\nalmost endless forest of chimneys, nnd\nthe pall of somber smoke that hangs\nover the flat, unaTtraetlve country.\nIn this smnll but highly mineralized\nregion, where men have dug coni for\nCO years, over 400 concerns now op\nerate mines or hold concessions for\ntheir exploitation. And the Ruhr In\nenough now, hut the great guns are\nsilent; Krupp makes them no more.\nThe big lutlie3 that once maile guns\nfor every nation, from Chile to China,\nnow turn out shnftlng for marine nnd\nother engines. Box cars for Belgium,\ncar wheels for South America, and\nwhole tram-line systems for the Dutch\nEast Indies were some of the orders\nbeing filled a few months ago.\nEverybody Is a Worker.\nThis Ruhr Is pre-eminently the habi\ntat of labor. Everybody works, and\nnearly everybody works with his hands.\nAn army of chemists, engineers and\ntechnical men Is employed, of course;\nbut they form merely u small element\nof the grimy, dusty, sweaty popula\ntion that keeps the coal moving, the\nfurnaces roaring, and the big lathes\nturning.\nThe population, variously estimated\nnt from three and one-half to four mil\nlions, is not easy to determine, be- j\ncause thousands come nnd go as the\ntide of trade rises and fulls; and no\nwhere Is the world-wide house short- |\nage more keenly ffelt than In this\ndensely populated Rrea. About many\nof the mines the government has set\nup temporary barracks where thou\nsands of miners are housed.\nIn the more picturesque and less\ncrowded spots of the Ruhr the over\nlords of industry have reared their\nvillas and spncious homes; but a dis\ntinctive leisure class, an Idle rich, like\nthe groups conspicuous In Charlotten\nherg, Dresden or Wiesbaden, Is n6t\nfound. Hundreds are here who have\nretired, hut they are the aged and\npensioned workmen, dozing comfort\nably In the clean, cozy colonies built\nfor them In cities like Essen.\nA tiny speck on the map is this\nheated, smoking, Ruhr, but big, like\na cinder, In the world’s eye—a spot\nthat Caesar knew, a high spot In a\nregion old In history.\nShort Jackets\nHave the Call\n■otne of the most notable successes\namong clothes hava had as their basis\na simple Idea which must hava oc\ncurred time and again to women all\nover the world, but we have become ao\naccustomed to waiting for the man\ndates of fashion to come from fashion\nauthorities that few women have the\ntemerity to create models, or If they\ndo create them they are afraid to wear\ntheir own creations, says a fashion\nwriter In the New York Tribune. We\nhave leurned to wait for the cachet\nof some great maker to uppear on a\nmodel before we accept It.\nAlmost every woman has felt the\nneed of some sort of Informal Jacket\non the order of a sweater to wear\nover lightweight, short-sleeved dresses.\nThere was nothing that filled this\nneed, especially for the summer. Most\nof the smart sweaters have, for the\nlast few years, been mode io slip on\nover the head, which practically made\nIt necessary to arrange or rearrange\nthe hair after the gurment was put\non.\nJackets Replace Coat Sweaters.\nThen the sweater la such a close\nfitting garment that It crushes the\nfrock; consequently, it Is\' hopeless ns\na jacket to wear over anything but a\nplain blouse where only the collars\nfind /lliffo o)w\\lir Kit Kolmr tnenml linolr\n[ ante coat as exploited In the fashions\nof the moment. The black background\nsets off to excellent advuntage multi\ncolored embroidery on the sleeves,\ncollar and pockets.\nOne would naturally expect that\nsomething more practical In material,\nbut similar In cut, should follow In the\nwake of these glorified outing Jackets\nbecause, when a fashion suddenly\nflames up almost over night, os It\nwere, and takes such a tremendous\nover the sweater neck and sleeves.\nThen, too, the summer sweater usual\nly Is so thin that the ugly line of a\nshort-sleeved dress shows lmlf-way\ndown the sleeve of the sweater.\nPractically every woman knew\nthat some sort of Jacket was needed\nIn place of the old-fashioned loose\ncont-swenter that did such good serv\nice In bygone years, but she waited\npatiently for the great designers In\nParis to launch this Idea. Her pntience\nwas rewarded by the clockl coats.\nIt may have been that there was\nno material sufficiently Inspiring to\nthe mind of the designer until Ro\ndler brought out his fubrlcs In blis\ntered effects. This would look like n\nreasonable supposition, since the vari\nous creutors of clothes selected clockl\nalmost simultaneously for the short\nseparate jackets which they succeeded\nIn popularizing almost over night, for\nthe demnnd for these jackets Is very\ngreat. It Is not to be supposed that\nany one with uny Imaginative genius\nwould stop with one sort of innteriul\nfor a new type of coat, so they have\ngone on from this material to others.\nTwo-Tier Pocketa on Model.\nNotnble among some lute models In\nthe short separate coat Is one In\nwhite satin clockl, trimmed with a\nborder of black satin poppy petals\nloosely applied. This Jacket Is smart\nwhen worn with a black crepe nrnro\ncain skirt and a black outdoor hat. It\nmakes a most distinguished costume,\nand one which will be eagerly seized\nupon by the woman who Is desirous of\ngetting away from the set type of\nsweuter and skirt and sweater and\noverblouse so universally worn.\nMadame Jenny, who so successfully\ncaters to the well-dressed Amerlcun,\nKnitted Jacket and Skirt In Black and\nColored Wool.\nhold on the public In general It has\nsomewhere In Its composition some of\nthe qualities which make a best seller,\nand no progressive dressmaker or\nmanufacturer Is going to relinquish\nsuch a profitable garment until every\nIdea that It contains hus been exploit\ned to the utmost. So for the autumn\nthese magnificent coats will be fol\nlowed by more practical ones of wool,\nmany of them knitted nfter the fash\nion of the old-time sweater-coat.\nRabbit Competes With Monkey\'s Pelt.\nSeveral great dressmakers have\ngone still further with this Idea and\nhave made skirts to match these Jack\nets, especially In the wool things.\nWorth has n model with the Jacket\nknitted In wool In plaid eftect—gray,\nwhite and black. The shawl collar on\nthe Jacket and the cuffs und girdle\nare of gray.\nMol.vneux shows n knitted Jacket\nIn white wool with pipings, buttons\nand belt of red leuther. With this may\nbe worn either a red or white wool\nskirt. Another Interesting Jacket Is\nof black and rust-colored wool In chine\neffect, with a trimming of black clre\nbraid and a belt of hlack suede.\nAmong the most luxurious of the\nshort coats are those of India cash\nmere trimmed with fur. Frenuentlv\nthe fur Is monkey skin. There Is a\nvogue for rabbit dyed to represent\nsquirrel, chinchilla aud kolinsky on\nshort coats.\nAt the beginning of a new season\nthe seemingly small details of dress\nplay an important part. Vital ques\ntions, such as the silhouette, are not\n\'definitely settled. So many Ideas are\nafloat as an aftermath of the French\nopenings that It Is unwise to choose\nsuch an important thing as a suit or\na dress without a good deal of careful\nconsideration, so women depend on\nthose things known as the accessories\nof dress to give newness to their cos\ntumes.\nNow one may freshen one\'s ward\nrobe by buying new collars and gir\ndles, or perhaps a few bits of the cos\ntume Jewelry which Is in fashion\'s\nlimelight at the present time.\nThere are any number of new col\nlars, both of lingerie and of ribbon,\nwhich are made to fit the various\nshaped necklines in favor. Many of\nthese are So unusual that a last sea\nson’s dress or suit jacket may he\nmetamorphosed by the add\'tIon of one\nof them.\'\nWhite lingerie collars In plnin and\nfrilled effects ure particularly smart\nwhen offset by bluck. Fine threud\nembroidery done in black Is often\nused. A further touch of black is\nsometimes added by a bow of ribbon\nor perhaps a long streamer.\nSmart Costumes.\nA complete costume of tine soft lace\nIn a toast-brown shude, with softly\ndraped wide hut and full-skirted dress,\nW\'as noted at a smart restaurant re\ncently. A cinder gray dotted Swiss\nfrock with frequently fairly wide\nbands of self-color grosgruln ribbon\nrunning lengthwise wus topped with a\nstraw matching shape alna hidden\nby folded velvet ribbon In dark jrown,\ncinder and deep salmon.\nThe Suit That Is Knitted of Beige\nand Brown Wool.\nhas found her greatest success In the\nseparate coat in u model developed\nIn white satin clock! trimmed with\nblack suede, which takes the form of\na border around tlie collnr, pocket\nbindings and bands on tlie sleeves. She\nvaries from the usual coat pocket by\nmaking the pockets In two tiers, that\nla, two on the right side just above\nthe hip, one directly above the other,\nand she repeats this treatment In\nbreast pockets.\nNo great dressmnker hHS overlooked\nclocbl In making up her mld-senson or\nearly autumn models. A two-piece\nsuit with hat to match by Worth Is\ndeveloped in this mnterlal in citron\nyellow, a shade frequently used In\nsuits earlier In the season and now\nprominent In both suits and Jnckets.\nA very striking jacket In black\neenanna is typical of the short, sep\n\'■ v ■> i,\n>******»»«\n1 BETTER\nROADS\nSAFE WIDTH OF HARD ROADS\nBureau of Public Roads Makes Recom\nmendation of 1> Foot to Provldo\nGood Clearance.\n(Prepared by the United states Department\not Asrlculture.)\nA minimum width of 18 feet for\nhard-surface road* Is recommended by\nthe bureau of public roads of the\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture. The maximum width of truck\nbody generally permitted Is 8 feet, and\n314 feet Is the ordinary clearance\nI \' \' " ■ n\ni Traffic on a 16-Foot Pavement.\nwidth of automobiles. At an average\nspeed of 30 miles an hour It Is unrea\nsonable to expect the driver of an\nautomobile to drive with the wheels\ncloser than 1H feet to the edge of the\npavement, says the bureau. For trucks\nat an average speed of 15 miles an\nhour, this distance should not be less\nthan 1% feet on account of the great\nwidth of the rear wheel. Three feet\nseems to be a minimum snfe clearance\nbetween bodies. Inasmuch as a cer\ntain amount of truck traffic Is to be\nexpected on all main country roads,\nthe minimum width of surface should\nbe 18 feet to provide these clearances\nwhen an automobile meets a truck.\nWhere the frequency with which\ntrucks pass ench other becomes a big\nfactor, ns In the neighborhood of lurge\ncities, the minimum width of pavement\nshould be 20 feet to provide a clear\nance of 3V4 feet and a safe distance of\nwheels from edge of pavement.\nGRAVEL FOR ROAD BUILDING\nSimple, Portable Apparatus Devised\nto Test Its Suitability\nfor Highways.\nTo aid the bureau of public roads.\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture, In giving particular attention to\nthe use of local material for road\nconstruction wherever possible, a sam-\'\npie portable apparatus has been de\nvised for testing gravel to determine\nIts suitability for concrete. The de\nvice consists of two steel halls ar\nranged so that a piece of gravel can\nbe placed on top of one of the balls\nand the other ball allowed to fall\nfrom different helgltfs and strike the\ngravel. The height of fall required to\nbreak the gravel is an indication of\nIts suitability to withstand the blows\nof traffic.\nHeretofore there has been no satis\nfactory test of gravel as there has\nbeen for stone, with the result that\nIn some Instances more costly mate\nrial has been used when a suitable\ngravel was available close at hand.\nAlong this line the bureau is conduct\ning wear tests on concrete made of\nmany different materials to determine\nJust bow far It is snfe to go when the\nquality of material Is doubtful.\nMONEY FOR COLORADO ROADS\nSecretary Wallace Approve* Expendi\nture of $586,000 for Highway*\nin Forect.\nExpenditures totaling $586,000 of\nnationul forest highway funds for the\nconstruction of 106 miles of roads In\nColorado have been approved by Sec\nretary of Agriculture Wallace.
