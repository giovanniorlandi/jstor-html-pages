It is frequently called by some\ntlier name which may be misleading,\nuch as scrofula, white swelling, rhuma\nisin, hunchback, etc.\nThe disease may attack any tissue of\nlie body so it shows itself in many difT\nrent forms.

The infection of this <lis- rur\nase is spread by persons already having qUj\nhe trouble. The sputum cauglied by as\nlie patient is expectorated carelessly on j,a,\nho ground, it is dried and pulverized in- f()I\no dust, this dust is blown about by the (.;|j\nvind and may be inhaled or it may settle j)C<\nin art icles of food and latteit he swallow\n30 large a number of people being affect- njj\n<1 by this disease and so many of thorn nn]\naking no care whatever to prevent its 0f\nspread we are often exposed to its dan- j01|\n?ers. - do\nWhen a collonv of these germs of tu- j|-f\n)erculosis start in bone or in a joint they jj1(\napidly increase in numbers all the while\nicting as an irritating poisonous sub\n>tance. The poison thrown off by this pn\nlest of germs is absorbed l?y the system\nind may cause loss of flesh, night sweats, j j)Q;\nl>odi!y weakness, loss of appetite, e!c. jer\nill of these symptoms may not be present ! ^ jI1\nit the same time.

None j\n>f these symptoms may ho present but 1\nin the course of time the disease will ;\nbreak over the breastworks and invade j\nnew territory, finally overppwering the\'\npatient. Tuberculosis is at times slow j\nbut always treacherous.\nThe bony bodies of the spinal column\nmay be invaded by the disease, they be\ncome softened so as to bo unable to sup\nport the weight of the upper portion of M\nthe body, their edges become thinned i?\nfrom pressure and we have spinal enrva-jor\nture or hunchback. The deformity is j M\ngreat, it tends to become rapidly worse, er\nThe internal organs of the body are fo\npressed upon and there is great suffering\nand death comes earl v. There are sov- E\noral forms of this trouble dejKMiding oti of\nthe direction in which . the bendinp of u"\nthe spine takes place. Tn the lateral or be\nside to side variety the trouble mav be ;\nit noticed in its beginning by the tailor\nthe dressmaker, one shoulder or one\n> being a little higher than the other,\n[f the treatment is begun early many\nthese cases can be cured. The wear\nj of plaster casts and other suitable\nplianees to take the pressure off the\nLamed bones does a great deal of good\nall cases. The treatment of this con\nion is necessarily very long and tedi\ni. The first patient treated by the\naring of plaster casts had to wear\n;in lor fifteen or more years but re\nved a perfect cure.\nTuberculosis of the bones commonly\nled white swelling begins usuiylly near\ni end of one of the long bones of the\nns or legs, though it may involve any\nio. The bone is gradually broken\nvn and destroyed?from a small patch\nthe end of a bone the whole bone may\nruined in a short time. A competent\'\ngeon should be seen, early so that the\neased spot can be removed and the\nib or part saved. The trouble begins\n\\i pain, soreness and later swelling,\nthese cases wait until pus conies and\nabscess forms under the skin, it may\ntoo late and amputation may be nec\nary. Jt is called white swelling bc\nise the skin is more apt to be white\nr the swollen area, while in ordinary\n.amation there is usually present a\nor livid condition of the skin. After\nabscess formed by the softening of\nbone, finally ruptures through the\nill and skin small pieces of bone often\n:ie away from time to time. The dis\ne may follow a bruise of the bone,\nlong the symptoms we have gnawing\n11, later swelling, and rise of temper\nre above the normal.\nTuberculosis of the hip joint is one\nthe most usual forms of joint, disease,\nu child begins to limp. Often pains\'\nfelt at the knee and the case is diag\ned as one of rheumatism. The thigh\nilrawn forward, the hip joint becomes ?\nF. The thigh and the body cannot be\nlight into a straight line with one\nit her. The muscles of the leg waste\niv from lack of exercise. Later as\ndisease progresses the\'liead of the\n?li bone will be destroyed and an ab\nss will be formed. The physician ^\nuld see these cases early. When taken\ntime many cases can be cured with\nthe use of the knife. Tf the ease\nits a horrible deformity will result\nI life even may be lost before the\nrse of the disease can he stayed.

The time of treatment\nlong and must extend over many\nntlis or even years. To get good re\nts the utmost care must be takeu 1111\ngood medical direction. In the treat\nnt, matters of climate, life out of\n?rs, the kij^d and quantity of food as\nI as medicine must be considered. No\nj cases will need exactly the same\natmcnt.

The\nlaw was -secured after the most strenuous\nefforts on the part of working women.\nRecently, a number of Chicago employers\ncombined in an attempt to have the law\ndeclared unconstitutional. The Presby\ni terian ministers of Chicago and vicinity\n: to the number of about 200, expressed\n(themselves very strongly in favor of the\ni women who are making this fight, and\nunanimously passed the following reso\nlut ion :\n4 4 Whereas, in one of tne Courts of\nChicago the ten-hour law for the restrict\n11 j ion of women *s labor has been declared\nunconstitutional, and whereas such lcgis\nrt- lation has been inforced in England for\nu\n1C j sixty years and in the state of Massa \'1*\nj chnsettes for more than thirty-five years. a.\ns* i and has been adopted by twenty-two Sl1\ns* i states in this union and declared to be\nrs! constitutional bv the Supreme Court of n<\nl?

P. of L. convention:\n"TIIE LABOR PRESS IS BECOM\nING MORE AND MORE A VEHICLE\nTHROUGH WHICH THE MEMBER\nSHIP IS BEING INFORMED AS TO\nTHE NECESSITY OF ORGANIZA\nT I O N. T II E ENCOURAGEMENT\nTHAT CLEAN CUT LABOR PAPERS,\nTHAT HEW TO THE LINE OF\nTRADES UNIONISM, CAN GIVE TO\nTHE ORGANIZED WORKERS IS DIF\nFICULT TO ESTIMATE. THEY ARE\nOF INESTIMABLE BENEFIT. A\nCITY CENTRAL BODY, WITHOUT\nAN OFFICIAL ORGAN, HAVING THE\nRESPECT AND CONFIDENCE OF\nTHE RANK AND FILE OF THE OR\nGANIZED WORKERS, CAN NOT AC\nCOMPLISH THE MAXIMUM RE\nSULTS."\nThe union label means the uplift of\nthe masses.\nIt doesn\'t take the knocker long to\nknock himself out.\nThe bi-partisan charter has certainly\nproven to be an expensive luxury.\nNow is the time to pay up your sub\nscript ion, so don \'t delay as we certainly\nneed the coin.\nPrison labor is degrading and lower\ning the American working iiipn and wom\nen. It. should be abolished.\nThe union label will unite the workers\nof the world and carry happiness and\nsunshine into their homes.\nThe Cabin Creek \'4 guards" and their\nmasters seem to be mightier than the\nstate and county administration.\nThe emblem of freedom and justice\n?the union label. Demand it at all\ntimes and make more happy homes.\nThe union label means the same to\nthe homes that the extra levy meant to\nthe city?cleanliness, protection, and\nprosperity.\nOne of the things that the union men\nof West Virginia have to offer thanks\nfor is the fact that Dayton is looking\nfor another job.\nWe return thanks for being allowed\nto exist these IL* months and would re\nturn many more if our delinquent subscri\nbers would ante up.\nTrade unions have done more toward\nexterminating the great white plague\nthan all the other forces combined. La\nbor does things and talks afterwards.\nOrganized labor of West Virginia\nmakes no unreasonable or class legisla\ntion demands, but asks that "equal and\nexact justice\'\' be administered to all.\nThe greed of unseurpulos and law de\nfving employers cause ten fold more\nwomen and children to be thrown on\nthe charity of the world than all other\ncauses combined.\nIt. must not be forgotten that the man\nwho takes advantage of others will take\nadvantage of you, if he ever finds it\nconveniently profitable to do so, no mat\nter how consistently he may pretend to\nbe vour friend.\nNo organization will prosper if its\nmembers become indifferent^and disloyal\nto its officers. Union men of West Vir\nginia got together and stick together.\nIt will take united action on the part of\nthe workers to secure justice from the\nopposition.\nREAD AND THINK\nThe workingman who doesn *t believe 1 ^\nin trade unions ought to read a little and !\nthen think a little. Prior to 1820 the!\nwork day was eleven to twelve hours, or 1\nfrom sun to sun. In that year the agi\ntation for a ten-liour day became quite j\ncommon and resulted in quite a number j\nof strikes. The merchants, manufacturers\nand employers generally pledged them\nselves not to employ laDorers unless they\nagreed to work twelve hours for a dollar\nJ a day.\nj Prom 1830 to 1865 the ten-hour eon\n\' tests resulted in a number of strikes and\nlockouts Thu <?Anur>;?n/.v lo?.-o en..* ? I\ndreds of our wageworker fathers and\ngrandfathers ..to jail, the military was\ncalled out on the slightest pretext, and\nthe ten-hoor agitators were openly de\ni nounced as a lazy, worthless gang of\nloaiers and drunkards. -?.\'he loss in wages\nthrough strikes and lockouts resulting\nfrom this agitation amounted to hun\ni dreds of thousands of dollars.\nJ We are reaping the benefits of their\nefforts, privations and punishments. Are\ne gratelui to those stanch old union\nsires? An you leiiov,s who work but\neight or ten hours are reaping the bene\nfits of unionism. Arc you willing to ac\ncept these benefits without giving union\nism your good will and support in re\nturn? Think this over as you go to and\nreturn from your work. Unionism needs\nyour co-operation.\nMUST STAf D FIRM.\nMUST STAND FIRM\n.mo Liuit* nas arnvea wneii every work\ning man should consider what he is doing\nto better his condition.\nAmerican freedom is too sacred to be\nsacrificed upon the altar of monopolies.\nPrinciples should be everything tp tlifc\nwage worker, next to his God, his family\nand his country. Wo put principle first\nbecause it leads to the latter. Show us a\nman who reads and learns how to better\nhis condition, who is not striving to shake\noff the yoke of oppression that now sur\nrounds him. _Show us the head of a\nfamily who, through long years of toil\nwith caret ul forethought and the God\ngiven assistance of a loving helpmate is\nnot\' striving to better the condition of\nhimself and little ones. Principles should\nbe everything to us, and fealtly to any\nother cause a secondary consideration.\nIf we don\'t strive to maintain our prin\nciples, on- uroresslons are but a mockery,\nand enemies scoff at the efforts we under\ntake for the amelioration of the toilers.\nWe must be firm and steadfast in our\nfight against oppression. We cannot af\nford to live on sentiment or memories,\nbut must buckle on the armor and strive\nby united efforts to gain that which is\nvouchsafed to us by a bencficant Creator.\nTRUE PATRIOTISM.\ni *:\nIf Charleston citizens ^would make it a I j\n[ unit to patronize lioino industries there\nwould certainly be an improvement in\nonditions all around that would surprise\neven the most pessimistic of our people.\nTake the items of stogies and cigars?\npurely a luxury?Charleston could give\nemployment, to at least three hundred ad\nditional stogie and cigar makers if the\ndomestic product was called for and in\nsisted on by those who consume the peni\ntentiary and sweat shop product from\nother cities.\nSo on down the line in every industry\nthere is room for improvement.\nThe mechanics employed here spend\ntneir earnings at home. The major por\ntion of their wages goes into the arteries\nof trade and their little savings are de\nposited in local banks. The money sent\naway is lost to Charleston.\nIt is a foolish and sucidal policy for\nour merchants, especially the cigar stores,\nto neglect home industries. On the con\ntrary, it would be an act of business sag\nacity for them to boost and patronize the\nlocal enterprises whenever and wherever\nthey can.\nLet us all make it a point to patronize\nhome industries, and thus help make\nGreater Charleston.\nCriminal thoughtlessness is a crime for\nwhich society has, time and time again,\nsent men to the gallows. It has ueen the\ncause of countless failures and disasters\nWere it not for the thoughtlessness or in\ndifference of ;i large proportion of our\nmembership in trade unions the constant\ncampaign against convict, child and other\nunderpaid labor would be unnecessary.\nBut it is still necessary, and will continue\nso until our inert members wake up and\npurchase only fair made, union labeled\ngoods. It is hardly a square deal to\n1 expect your fellow worker to patronize\n\'your union card or label if you ignore his.\nThe Rev. Charles Stelzle, whose know\nledge 01 the labor press in general is per\nhaps greater than that of an other man\nnot engaged in publishing one, says that\n"the labor press is the fairest in the\nworld, because it has admitted to its col\numns criticisms against itself which no\nother paper would dare do. The labor\npress exists for the whole labor move\nment, and not simply for a part of it.\'\'\nHas your union selected a correspon- ,\ndent for the Argus? Come, now, get\nbusy.

FOR THOUGHT.\nThe A. P. of L. committee on the La\nbor Press at the Toronto convention ex- f\npressed itself on that subject in the fol-* -\nlowing manner in its report which was\nunanimously addopted:? c\nThe position of your committee on the\nsubject of Labor Press is clearly express- !_\n3d in the report of the Denver Convention\nis follows:\n"We desire to express our thanks to\n:he editors of the official journals of our\nNational and International Unions as well\nis the bona fide labor press. We fully\nrealize many of the disadvanages under\nwhich the editors of bona fide labor pap\ners have to work, but we desire to com\nmend them for untiring efforts and de\nmotion to our cause. However, we realize\n;hat there are publications issued which\nmasquerade as labor papers, but which in\neality are but vultures upon the body\npolitic, and whose columns are open to\nlie highest bidder, particularly those bid\nlers who arc in opposition to our move\nment. For this class of so-called labor\npapers we have nothing but the utmost\nontempt, but would urge upon our mem\nbers and friends, wherever possible, to\njive their support to the regular bona fide\nabor papers.\n"We desire to add that there is not\npseudo-labor paper published any-where\nn the country that the lo? al labor niove\nnent in the vicinity of its publication is\nlot in a position to know that it is such,\nmd if the labor movement in a vicinity\nwhere such publications exist will exert\nts influence in the proper direction, it\nvill be but a question of a short time un- ^\nil papers of that character have been put Q\n>ut of existence, to the lasting material ^\njcneflt of the bona-fide labor press and |j\nhe labor movement.\n"The Labor Press is one of the best u\nivenues of education available to the\nTrade Union movement. Its subscribers B\nire found in all parts of the country and Q\nn the aggregate are numerous. If prop- ^\n!rly utilized, it can wielu a wonderful in- ^\nlucnco in moulding public opinion. u\nThrough its columns, the same thought\nan be impressed upon thousands of Ci\nniiuls, in widely scattered, communities, j,\nit the same time. Tt could be made the -Q\nneans of conveying, correctly, the posit- i\n011 of organized labor on the question of I\ninjunctions and other legislative measures\n, c\nvhich we are interested in. therebv creat- .\nng greater unanimity of action than ^\nonId otherwise obtain.\n"Your committee recommends that the; *\nExecutive Council be instructed to in- !\nestigate the subject of creating a press\n>ared matter might be furnished at cost -\no papers desiring the same, in such a\nnanner as not to conflict with the laws\njl Liiv muua iTinutip i radcs, ana n .\nround feasible, proced to establish and\njporate such an institution."\nOn one Sabbath day whilst the children\n)f Israel were journeying in the wilder\nless of Mount Sinai, one of them was ,\nictually caught in the act of "picking up ,\nsticks," he was arrested and brought be\nfore the chief magistrates who examined 1\nlie law. but finding none 011 that subject\nhey declared that for this lienious crime :\nlie man should be taken without the j\namp and "stoned to death."\nThis same spirit lurks in 1\' government\n;>y injunction," but the civilized, human- I\nzed, part of the people do not approve\n1\nt, and will not alwavs submit to it.\nIf the union men of West Virginia\nivant an Employers Liability Act and a\nMeasure protecting them against the in\nmman " guard system they should man\nfest it by action.

Stelzle.\nEach year seems\' to raise the standard\nof the- men who come to th^conventions\nof the A. F. of Ij. Those who have been\noming regularly, year after year, natural\nly become more eflicient because they are\nmore highly trained in the things which\nnake for better leadership. They are\nmore tolerant of others\' mistake** nnd\nshortcomings. They are steeled against\nmere pettiness. They are more optimistic\nas to the possibilities l\'or the workingmen\nand workingwomen of America and of the\nworld. Their grasp of the bigger prob\nlems in the industrial world is large, be\nause their outlook is broader.\nComing into contact with this type of\nleadership, the younger and more inex\nperienced delegate catches something of\ntheir spiritx It is a real education to him.\nhe goes back to his own central body and\nto his local with a vision of better things,\nhe has for the time being gotten away\nfrom the narrowness of comparatively\nlittle things and he returns with the feel\ning that this labor problem is a much big\nger thing than he ever dreamed. Needless\nto say it pays to send a delegate to the\nconvention of the American Federation of\nLabor?pays the man who goes and the\nbody that sends him.\nAll of the above applies with, pe\nculiar force to the recent convention held\nin Toronto. Here are come together the\npicked men in the world oft labor. They\n\'uive risen from the ranks by the sheer\nbrce of native ability. They have come\n.if) through storm and shock. They have\nbeen shown no favor merely because of so\nial position, wealth, or family prestige?\nthe things which govern in the selection\nof other groups. Every man has earned\nhe place which he now occupies.\nTo such men may safely be entrusted\nthe destines of the toilers of America, not\nt hat every man is a paragon of excellence,\nnor that they never make mistakes. But\n\'he good sense of the entire body usually\nprevails and errors are soon rectified.\nMarvelous is the patience of tlve dele\nrales as they listen to long-drawn-out dis\ncussions which nobody seems willing to cut\n?ii, occuase or tlx1 keen desire to give j\nvery follow :i square deal. And always\nIocs the right side win, provided, of\nourse, that it can prove its case. Some\niincs for the moment, technicalities ap\npear to crowd out justice, but everybody\ncognizes the fact that, those men will\ncic that wrongs shall bc-righted, ultimate\nIv. even though the law demands arbitrary\naction in a particular case.\nOrganized labor need not be ashamed\nof the men who compose this couvqjntion.\nThey would measure ii\'?
