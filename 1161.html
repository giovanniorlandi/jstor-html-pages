X.\nDrink and Games in Big Col\nleges.\nChicago Millionaire Arraigns\nLarge Universities of Country.\nDeclares More Debauchery Ex\nists at Columbia Than at Oth\ners. Conditions at Harvard.\nPrinceton and Cornell Almost\nas Bad, Yale Drinking so\nRecognized that Clubs meet in\nBarrooms. Iron Manufacturer\nInsists that ‘‘Higher Educa\ntion” is Doing More Harm\nthan Good.\nChicago, 111., Sept, 10.—R. T.\nCrane, millionaire iron manu\nfacturer, made public today an\narraignment of the big universi\nties of the country. He charges\nalarming prevalence of drinking\nand gaming among the students.\nColumbia he ranks the worst,\nbut conditions at Harvard,\nPrinceton and Cornell, he de\nclares, are almost as bad.\nOf the students at Harvard 90\nper cent, drink in their freshman\nyear, 95 per cent, in their senior\nyear, and 17 per cent, of them sro\nirretrievably to the bad, accord\ning to the report of an investiga\ntion which Mr. Crane had made.\nMr. Crane hss spent much time\nand money putting under scruti\nny the result of higher or col\nlege education.. So bitter is he\nin consequence . that he declares\nthat the colleges do more harm\nthan good.\nMr. Crane says in bis report:\nCOMBINE WINE AND WOMEN.\n“An outsider can scarcely real\nize the amount of drinking that\ngoes on in the clubrooms of the\ncolleges. Referring particular\nly to Harvard, 1 estimate the\nnumber of students who combine,\nin a mild degree, wine and bad\nwomen, 65 per cent.; who drink\nheavily, 35 per cent., and who\nhave two or three ‘bats’ a year,\n45 per cent.\n“I do not doubt that even a\nworse state of affairs exists at\nother colleges. At Princeton it\nis beer, beer, beer. The town\nhas license and the body of stu\ndents in my mind drink even\nmore than Harvard men. On\none occasion I believe there must\nhave been more than 300 stu\ndents dead drunk.\n“In Yale drinking is recog\nnized in so great a degree tnat\nclubs have their tables in the\nbarrooms. I never was so struck\nin my life when I found New\nHaven the dissolute, debauched\nand whiskey town that it is.\nSome time ago the statement\nappeared in a New Haven paper\nthat there were 2,000 fallen wo\nmen in that city.\nCORNELL IS GREAT ON BEER.\n“At Cornell the conditions are\nsomewhat the same, although I\nbelieve Cornell students do not\ncarry their excesses so far as do\nboys at Princeton, Yale and\nCambridge. The Cornell boys\nare great on beer, as are also the\nmen at Princeton.\n“At Columbia I believe there\nexists more debauchery than at\nany other college on account of\nits proximity to the famous re\nsorts of the city. If further\nproof be necessary, let me quote\nfrom a letter received from E. C,\nMercer, who is special secretary\nof the Association of the Colleges\nof North America, and he is fol\nMISSISSIPPI, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1011.\nlowing the matter for the asso\nciation, which shows that it has\ntaken upon itself the work of re\nforming college men.\n“He is its special secretary and\nis visiting the colleges and de\nlivering a lecture, entitled ‘Col\nlege Men I Have Met in the\nSlums and Prisons of New York\nCity.’ He says:\nCONTRIBUTE TO BREAD LINE.\n“ ‘I did say and haye written\nproof to back me up that I have\nmet personally and have heard\nfrom the most reliable authori\nties of some 1,200 college-bred\nmen in the slums, prisons, jails\nand sanitariums who were down\nand out through fast living.\nThe noted Dread line in our city\nhas constantly in it college-bred\nmen.’ ”\nThe rest of Mr. Crane’s report\nis a story of drinking, immoral!\nty, brawling and reckless money\nspending. He gives many ex\namples and says the proof is ir\nrefutable.\nThe report, which is printed\nin the current number of the\nValve World, owned bv Mr.\nCrane, describes unsparingly\nstudent dissipation and is a re\nmorseless indictment of not onlj\nthe universities, but of the mu\nnicipal government that permits\nsuch conditions.\nJUDGE CARROLL SAYS\nLAW MUST BE OBEYED\nCLUBS SHOULD BE REGU\nLATED\npopular Jurist Delivers an Able\ncharge in which Enforcement\nof Prohibition statutes is\nStrongly urged\nRecent investigations by tl e\ncity authorities have developed\nthe fact that the Illicit sale of\nliquor has been freely indulged\nin here, and Judge Thomas B.\nCarroll, who is presiding over\nthe September terra of circuit\ncourt, which convened at nine\no’clock Monday morning, in de\nlivering his charge to the grand\njury forcefully urged that body\nto make dilligent inquiry into\nlocal conditions and to return in\ndictments wherever it is found\nthe prohibition laws are being\nviolated.\nAfter having named Mr. John\nC. Golding as foreman’ Judge\nCarroll immediatly began his\ncharge, and, as stated above,\ndwelt with emphasis upon the\nviolation of the statutes prohibit\ning the sale of liquor. He not\nonly urged insistent war upon\nthe places commonly known as\nblind tigers but demanded an in\nvestigation of the manner in\nwhich liquor is said to be dis\npensed by local clubs and frater\nnal organizations. He said that\nhe had never been in any of the\nlocal club rooms, and therefore\ndid not know the manner. in\nwhich they are operated, but\ncounselled the grand jurors to\nmake diligent inquiry into the\nmatter and not hesitate to re\nturn indictments in all cases\nwhere the State laws governing\nthe sale of liquor are not being\nrigidly complied with.\nWhile Judge Carron was dis\ncoursing upon the various viola\ntioos of the prohibition statues\nMr. Golding, the foreman of the\ngrand jury, asked that that body\nbe given specific information re\ngarding laws regulating the sale\nof liquor by clubs and other\norganizations where intoxicants\nare dispensed. In compliance\nwith Mr. Golding's request.\nJudge Carroll stated that under\nthe laws of Mississippiyioclub or\norganization of any character\nhad the right to make straight\nout sales of liquor £to *4ts mem\nbers. He said that under\nthe law the officers of any\nproperly chartered organization\ncould order liquor for members\nthereof, but each individual must\nkeep his bottle in a box or other\nreceptacle, and that under no\ncircumstances should there be\na sale within the confines of the\nclub room.\nBesides dwelling at length up\non the alleged violations of the\nprohibition statutes, Judge Car\nroll mentioned a number of other\nmatters to which the law directs\nhim to call the attention of all\ngrand juries impaneled in courts\novei which he presides. He in\nstructed the members of the\nbody to inquire into the con\nditions at the jail and county\nfarm, to examine the books of\nvarious county officials and to\ndo everything possible to ferret\nout violations of the law of any\nand every character.\n—Columbus Dispatch.\nOne violation of the law is as\nas great as another.hoj. that of\nprohibition seems more promi\nnent and pernici us to the well\nbeing of society-the entire human\nfamily we may say.\n801 l 'Weevil Education.\nOne of the most valuable les\nsons driven home by the boll\nweevil invasion is the value ol\ncattle tick eradication. In che\nsouthwestern counties, when the\n“blessings” first appeared, the\nlesson has been well learned.\nThat it spreads with the boll\nweevil advance we read in the\nfollowing action in certain coun\nties where the pest has proved\na serious injury to the crop, for\nthe first time:\nDr. Hecker, United States vet\nerinary inspector, appeared be\nfore the board of supervisors of\nYazoo county yesterday after\nnoon in the interest of “tick\neradication,” and induced the\nboard to allow $1,500 to build\nvats and buy material for the dip.\nTo begin the work an inspector\nfor the county will be employed\nand five vats will be fitted up in\neach beat of the county, which\nwill be 25 for the county. The\ngovernment will furnish a man\nto instruct the county inspector,\nand in that way the entire work\nwill be under government inspec\ntion.\nThe board of supervisors of\nSharkey county today voted for\nthe installation of ten cattle dip\nping vats to be used for the\neradication of the catt) tick. It\nwas successfully shown to the\nmembers of the board that on\naccount of the boll weeyil cotton\ncould no longer be depended on\nabsolutely. Diversification and\nlive stock raising would necessa\nrily take its place.

In 1903, I began to have trouble from\nmy back and kidneys and It was not long be\nfore I found that my condition was getting\nworse. The pain in my back was almost un\nbearable and often I could notjstand for more\nthan an hour at a time. My back was weak\nand my bladder became inflamed, The kid\nney secretions were a source of annoyance\nand I rested so poorly that when I got up In\nthe morning, I was all tired out. I was treat\ned by physicians here and finding no Jellef\nsought help from physician in Memphis. The\nresults of his treatment was the same and I\nwas discouraged.

The\nStudents\nn^STQ£_£j/S5Hi) {} on eclipses all the\nin-season alTiirs.\nPastor Russell of Brooklyn Tabernacle,\nnow also of London Tabernacle, is the\nprinciple speaker on the program.\nHundreds of ministers and thousands\nof Bible students are In attendance.\nThe program shows more than sixty\npublic addresses. The Association is\nunsectarian. Christian union on the\nBible basis and without sectarian\nfences to separate is the sentiment—\nthe Bible truths, previously misunder\nstood and misinterpreted by the jar\nring, separating creeds, is the expla\nnation. God’s love and Mercy in the\nblessing of the Church and the world\nand the glorious salvations provided\nis the key-note. The Convention will\ncontinue in session another week.\nPastor Russell, remarking that the\nbeautiful grounds and Auditorium- are\nthe property of the Methodist Breth\nren, took for his text John Wesley’s\nfavorite slogan of Free Grace—“And\nthe Spirit and the Bride say. Come;\nand let him that heareth say. Come;\nand let him that is athirst come; and\nwhosoever will, let him take the wa\nter of life freely” (Revelation xxli.\n17). Pastor Russell remarked that\nProtestantism in general was Calvin\nistlc when Brother Wesley began his\npreaching, “God Is Love:” “Whosoever\nwill may come and take of the water\nof life, freely”—there is no predestina\ntion to eternal torture! The result of\nBrother Wesley’s teachings Is seen,\nnot merely In the numbers professing\nMethodism and Free Grace: his influ\nence has overswept ail the Calvinistlc\ndenominations. Their confessions of\nfaith still are Calvinistlc, but in their\nhearts and on their tongues they have\nBrother Wesley’s Message, “God is\nLove; He never predestinated anybody\nto eternal torture.”\nRight In Some Particulars —Wrong In\nOthers.\nPastor Russell declares that Broth\ners Calvin and Wesley were both right\nin certain particulars and both wrong\nin other particulars. Brother Calvin\nwas quite right in declaring an elec\ntion according to grace, and in speak\ning of the Church as God’s elect, and\nIn exhorting the Church to make their\n“calling and election sure.” He was\nright in these matters because he was\nin accord with the Bible. But he was\nwrong in declaring that God had pre\ndestinated the non-elect to an eternity\nof suffering—because there la no Scrip\nture to this effect The only Scripture\nrespecting Divine predestination re\nlates to the Church—the elect It tells\nus that God foreknew the Church as a\nspecially elect class and predestinated\nthat no one could be a member of this\nclass except such as would become\ncopies of His Son, the Redeemer. To\nthis, the Scriptural predestination,\nnone can object It is the unscrlp\ntura) deductions which hay© caused us\nditticuMy.\nSt Paul gives the key to the situa\ntion in I Timothy 11, 4-6. He declares\nthat it is God’s will that all men shall\nbe saved (recovered from the condem\nnation which came upon all through\nAdam) and also come to an accurate\nknowledge of the Troth. He declares\nthat it is for this reason that Jesus be\ncame the Mediator between God and\nthe world of mankind and that the*\ntestimony of this great fact will reach\nall men “in due time.”\nft. lo JtoLi “Qua Tim*"\nNow Is the Church’s “due time** to\nsee and to hear, but not the world’s.\nSatan blinds and deafens the world of\nmankind now so that only a favored\nfew, comparatively, hear and see\nGod’s proffered "race In Christ, Great\nis the blessing of those who see and\nbear, for they may make their calling\nand election sure and become joint\nheirs with their Redeemer in His Mes\nsianic Kingdom. Then will be due\nthe blessing of the non-elect. Satan\nwill be bound for the thousand years\nof Messiah’s Kingdom. Darkness, Ig\nnorance and superstition shall flee.\nThose then refusing to bow and con\nfess under this full and gracious op\nportunity will die the Second Death,\nfrom which there will be no resurrec\ntion, no restitution. They will per\nish as brute beasts—be utterly destroy\ned from amongst the\nil, 12; Acts 111, 10-23).\nBrother Wesley’s favorite text pro\nclaiming Free Grace is a precious one\nstill, though it does not belong to the\npresent Age. but to the coming one.\nThe proof of this is evidenced by the\ncontext. The Church is not yet com\nplete. She is not yet the Bride, the\nLamb’s Wife, but merely His espoused\nvirgin.\nA Successful Farmer.\nTo show that di versficatio\nis the main success in farming\nis demonstrated bo the way Mr\nLuther Oswalt of Self Creek\nhas succeeded. A few years ago\nhe came to this county from\nWebster, bought a small farm\nwhich was considered very poor\nlaud, some even going: so far to\nsay that the land wouldnt sprout\ncow peas. He did not pay any\nattention to this kind of unasked\nfor advice, but went to work\nwith all the energy he possessed\nand began to improve the farm.\nIn a short time he had put\nthat laud iti such a condition\nthat it soon paid him for the\ntime and trouble. He has been\nmaking the tinest kind of crops,\nbelieving in diversication. Every\nyear his barn is frill of corn, fod\nder, peas and hay, and makes\nplenty of cotton. His smoke\nhouse is at home raising suffi\ncient meat and sells some. He\nwill move to IStarkville about the\nIst of November, having bought\na lot on which he will oderate a\nboarding house. He lias rented\na house from Mrs. Connell which\nhe will occupy u*itil his residence\nis completed. He will farm here\ntwo having rented fifteen acres\nof land near the fair grounds.\nNURTURING CRIME.\nThe question being discussed\neditorially from Maine to Cali\nfornia and Minnesota to Florida,\nis shall Beulah Binford, Paul\nBeattie and Henry Clay Beattie,\nJr. be kept off the stage and a\nway from the moving picture\nshow which are patronized prin\ncipally by the women and child\nren. An enterprising film maker\ntook pictures as the trial prog\nressed and was ready to give the\nmoving picture shows the benefit\nof his enterprise, but this trio of\nnotorious characters are receiv\ning the rebuff they deserve and\nthe chances are that not one ot\nthem will be tolerated by decent\npeopJe, neither before the foot\nlight nor through the motion\npicture show, and the entire\naffair will be cast into oblivion as\nearly as possible. The chances\nare very slim for Henry Cla.>\nBeattie, Jr. to appear other than\nin the electic chair a few days\nbefore Thanksgiving day, to pay\nthe penalty for the terrible\ncrime for which he stands con\nvicted.\nThe following from the Nash\nville Tennessean is a fair ex\npression from the press on the\nBinford-Beattie case and sizes\nthe situation up accurately;\nTheatrical managers and mov\ning picture .makers who are seek\ning to give wide publicity to\nBeulah Binford and Paul Beat\n| SPECIAL INDUCEMENTS. |\nIfflU * OFFKBED TO YOU\n® Buy Your Coal Now! |\'\n.. . from pgjl\nI NANCE ™e MAN |\nIf —CHEAPERIN PRICE-STANDARD IN QUALITY. — ®\n| jraVK RED-FEATHER AND RRILUANT BRANDS |\nI -WOOD Sri notice DR AY AGE— |\n0® Service Perfect, Prompt, Reasonable, Reliable.\nIp S\'\n| piano Moving Phone 240. |\nmb |S|,\nI /ißabe the farm More attractive. |\nH “2To"cl can clo tlxis 1037- in- ||\ni stallirLgr a, lei epncne-T"cm\nS can males tlb.e sx3.xxo-u.xxd.- fe\nm ixx.g\'s cel 3rctnx farm just as p\nli to “S7~o"dx sons\n88 and cdamgrlatexs as xf\ng| were lixrin.g in. tlxe laeaxt g?\nH of a Toigr cit3T.

Already many promi\nnent actors have protested a\ngainst the appearance of Paul\nBeattie on the stage, and it is\nnot likely he will be able to till\nmany engagements. Nan Pat\nterson tried a stage career after\nher trial for the murder of Cae\nsar Young, but the public refustd\nto accept her. She was hooted\nfrom the stage in several Penn\nsylvania towns and retired after\na few performances.\nBeulah Binford and Paul Beat\nlie will doubtless meet a similar\nrebuff, In fact, several cities\nhave already forbidden moving\npictures of the notorious girl to\nhe shown and it is likely tha\nothers will take similar action.\nBecause of the mystery sur\nrounding the murder of Mrs.\nHenry Clay Beattie, Jr., public\ninterest centered on the trial of\nHenry Clay Beattie, Jr., and the\nother persons whose names were\nconnected with the crime. This\nlorcedthe newspapers to give\nmuch space to the murder, bat\nwith the end of the trial the\nnotorious persons concerned\nshould be allowed to drop into\ntho obscurity which surrounded\nthem before the tragedy.
