The decision\nnot,to complete the combination is due\nin a large degree to the attitude of the\nnational administration toward trusts\nas outlined by President Roosevelt in\nhis recent? speeches, arid to the possi\xad\nbility that in the event of a con sol Ida\ntion congress might remove the tar\niff on cattle.\nIt has just been learned that a final\nmeeting of the heads of the firms\nknown as the "Big Four" packing\xad\nhouses in Chicago had been held, at\nwhich it Was agreed t-o erid ail nego\xad\ntiations at once.\nThis was followed by an order issued\nfrom the office of Swift & \'Co\', that the\nfirm\'s emipioyes should imiriediately\ndiscontinue the inveritory of property\nand stock which had. been ordered and\nstarted for the. purpose of tabulating\na. report of the financial condition of\nthe company which was to have been\nused as a basis of the division of\nshares in the combine.\nPRESIDENT PALMA PROTESTS.\nObjects to Removal of Army Records\nFrom\'Cuba.\nHavana, Sept. 25.*—One month ago\nPresident Palma wrote a letter to\nWashington asking that all the mili\xad\ntary records now in charge of Chief\nClierk Steinhrirt be kept in Cuba for\nat least\' one year as they were abso\xad\nlutely necessary to conduct govern\xad\nment business.

The race\nprogram brought out one race that was\ninteresting, possibly the best that has\neven been seen on the track, in .the\n2:15 trot. There weTe three entries in\nthis race, Riverside, a gray gelding,\nTlhelma, chestnut mare, and Billy the\nKid, a rfoad horse. The latter horse\nwas never in the race, except for third\nmoney. The contest was between Riv\xad\nerside and Thelima, and four heats\nwere trotted before the race was de\xad\ncided. Both are nicely moving ani\xad\nmals, steady and fast. In the first\nheat Riverside broke just before enter\xad\ning the stretch on the first turn, and\nThelma took the lead, spurting ahead\nfor several lengths. Riverside steadied\ndown and closed up the gap, but the\nhorses were so evenly matched for\nspeed\\ that the loss of place wa* too\ngreat for him to overcome, although\nthe gray and the chestnut came under\nthe wire separated by less than a\nlength. In the second heat, Thelma\nbroke at the same place that Riverside\ndid on ithe first heat, and the gray got\nahead, and kept his lead to the finish,\nIn the third and fourth heats, River\xad\nside, with the pole, took the lead at the\nstart and \'held it to the finish. Now\nthe horses were separated by two or\nthree lengths and now Thelma would\nclose up the gap, but was unable to\noutfoot itihe gray. In the stretch in\neach heat there was a pretty exhibition\nof driving and pacing, but the gray was\nnot to be overhauled, and won the sec\xad\nond, third and fourth heats. Both are\nsplendid animals, and the race was the\nonly one of the afternoon that was\ncreative of much interest. The time\nfor .the heats was 2:20, 2:181-2, 2:20,\nand 2:211-2. It was announced from\nthe stand that these were the fastest\nfour consecutive heats ever trotted on\nthe track.\nThe running race was between Hali\nmore, a brown mare Gallieo, chestnut\nstallion, and Jim, Austin Logan\'s\nbrown gelding. Halimorie won the half\nmile and repeat, although there was a\ngeneral belief among a number of spec\xad\ntators that the chestnut was not put\nto Ms best paces in the race.\nThe 3jminute trot was won by Hub\nbut, Jr., with Kelloggo second and\nBelle Dickson third. The time of the\nfirst heat was 2:54. Gallieo took the\n-novelty running race. Halimore bolted\nand \'threw \'her rider, Bradford, who\nslid for some distance along the track,\nand was shaken\' up oonsideraibly but\nwas not hurt.\nBetween the racing was sandwiched\nin some roping and breaking of bron\xad\nchos. This was accompanied with\nconsiderable cruelty, that while it\nmigiht have been necessary in real life,\nwas rather revolting as a master of dis\xad\nplay. The horses were undersized ani\xad\nmals, with, hardly a pitch in them, and\nthe riding was exceedingly tame.\nAs an agricultural exhibition the fair\nis not what it should be. The ladies in\ncharge of the fine arts and fancy work\ndepartments, seem to have come to the\nrescue, and have saved the exhibit in\nthe pavilion from being uninteresting.\nThere are some splendid exhibits of art\nwork, including painting, tapestries,\nhand-painted china, embroidery, car\npet work, laces, and the various handi\xad\nworks of skillful brains and fingers.\nMrs. Tur&er, Mrs. Haskins and other\nladies in ciiiarge of the departments\nhave done hard work, and their efforts\n•have been of great value on the upper\nfloor of the pavilion. Below there are\nsome exhibits of butter that are gaol\nStone, of Fargo, and Phelps, of Bis\xad\nmarck, have an extensive exhibit of\npianos and musical goods. Mrs. J.

The\nsuccess of Sousa has no parallel in\nmusical history in this country, having\nbeen achieved by his own indomitable\nenergy and unaided efforts. Sousa is\nAmerican born, of American education,\nuninfluenced by foreign schools, and\nhe typifies in his person and in his ca\xad\nreer the highest standards of Ameri\xad\ncan achievements in his own field of\nendeavor. This hold upon public favor\nand affection is perhaps due largely to\nthe fact that Sousa is honest with his\nPublic and ever gracious in his rela\ntions with them. Certain it is that\nthe "Mairch King" was never held in\nsuch high esiteem as at present, and\nthe financial and popular success,of his\ngreat band now eclipses all its former\nretwds.
