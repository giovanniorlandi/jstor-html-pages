        <pre>["“Today, with the democratic opposition intimidated and the official election process well \nunder way, Pinochet has apparently won the battle to remain in office through 1989. With \neach passing protest, the popular street chant heralding the regime’s imminent demise— \n“Y va a caer!” ( I t ’s going to fa ll!)— seems more and more like wishful thinking.”\nPinochet’s Grip on Chile\nB y  P a m e l a  C o n s t a b l e\nLatin America Correspondent, Boston Globe\nC\nHILEAN President Augusto Pinochet, who \nsurvived a spectacular terrorist attack Sep\xad\ntember 6, 1986, continues to defy the demo\xad\ncratic opponents who have been attempting since 1983 \nto speed Chile’s transition to civilian rule. Using a \ncombination of stepped-up military repression and \nshrewd political maneuvering, the resilient 70-year- \nold general has benefited from floundering opposition \nleadership, partial economic recovery, public apathy \nand increasing leftist violence. As a result, Pinochet \nnow seems likely to remain in power at least through \n1989, when his current term expires.\nOn one level, the assassination attempt—the first \non Pinochet’s life since the coup that brought him to \npower in September, 1973—was a political godsend \nfor the general. In previous weeks, the general had \nboosted his unofficial reelection campaign for 1989 by \npublicizing the discovery of large hidden arsenals, \ndescribed by officials as a revolutionary war chest. \nComing so soon afterward, the attack seemed to vin\xad\ndicate his repeated warnings of a terrorist threat from \nthe left and his pronouncements that only continued \nmilitary rule could protect the country from a resur\xad\ngence of the Marxist left that had managed to win \nnational office, for the first time in Latin American \nhistory, with the election of President Salvador Allende \nGossens in 1970. Within a day of the attack, Pinochet \nappeared on state television, brandishing his band\xad\naged left hand and declaring that his government was \nfighting a “war between democracy and chaos.”\nIn reality, Pinochet saw the assault as an excuse to \ncrack down on left-wing terrorists and to renew \nrepressive measures against a broad range of oppo\xad\nnents whom he had been treating with increased tol\xad\nerance in the preceding months. Shortly after the attack, \nthe dictator declared a state of siege—reportedly against \nthe advice of senior military aides—that permitted the \ngovernment to arrest, banish or exile individuals with\xad\nout charge, censor the press, ban public meetings and \nimpose curfews. Compared to the state of siege that\n'For a more detailed treatment of Pinochet’s relations \nwith the military, see Arturo A. Valenzuela and J. Samuel \nValenzuela, eds., Military Rule in Chile: Dictatorship and Oppo\xad\nsitions (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986).\nhad been invoked between November, 1984, and June, \n1985, the 1986 siege featured ominous new elements: \nresurgent paramilitary intimidation and execution not \nacknowledged by the government.\nDuring the first few days, the regime ordered doz\xad\nens of house-to-house raids, deported three left-lean\xad\ning priests long active in the Santiago shantytowns, \nsuspended six opposition publications, including the \ncentrist magazine Hoy, and detained 14 leftist leaders, \namong them  R icardo Lagos, an in ternationally  \nrespected economist and official of the moderate wing \nof the Socialist party. At the same time, teams of armed \nand unidentified men broke into homes, hunting down \nand dragging off four leftists, including Juan  Ca\xad\nrrasco, an editor at Chile’s largest-circulation maga\xad\nzine, Andlisis. Later, Carrasco and the other three were \nfound slain.\nPinochet also viewed the assassination attempt as \na way to recoup support among the armed forces, \nwhich had been showing increasing signs of dissent \nfrom his plan to succeed himself in office after 1989. \nIn the past, Pinochet had relied on his powers of hier\xad\narchical reward and punishment to keep the military \nin line, holding even senior officers on a tight leash \nby promoting loyalists and retiring critics at will. \nAdding frequent doses of anti-Communist rhetoric and \nreminders of the judicial humiliation of Argentine offi\xad\ncers linked to human rights abuses before the return \nto civilian rule in 1983, Pinochet calculated that when \npush came to shove, the officer corps would follow its \ncommander in chief.1\nDuring the past year, several prominent officers, \nnotably General Fernando Matthei, commander of the \nair force and a member of the ruling junta, had spoken \nout periodically against the prospect of indefinite mil\xad\nitary rule and had called on the government to resume \ntalks with civilian leaders. The talks had broken down \nin 1983 and subsequently had been flatly rejected by \nPinochet. Several top-ranked army generals had \nreportedly been discussing how to persuade Pinochet \nnot to run for office in 1989, and had been disturbed \nat the general’s increasing propensity to use force.\nIn July, both supporters and opponents of the regime \nwere alarmed by the gruesome burning death of\n17\n", '18 CURRENT HISTORY, JANUARY, 1987\n19-year-old Rodrigo Rojas de Negri. The son of a left\xad\nist exile in Washington, D.C., Rojas was visiting Chile \nduring a series of street protests on July 2, when he \nand a group of youthful demonstrators were stopped \nby an army patrol, possibly while carrying materials \nto start bonfires. According to witnesses, Rojas and a \ncompanion, Carmen Gloria Quintana, were doused \nwith flammable liquid and set afire by the soldiers. \nRojas died several days later and Quintana was severely \nburned.\nThe incident, which aroused strong criticism abroad, \nset off a telling squabble within the armed forces. Some \nof the evidence against the soldiers was provided by \nthe national police, an unusual breach of regime sol\xad\nidarity not totally explained by interagency rivalries. \nAfter the army turned a number of soldiers over to a \ncivilian prosecutor, the prosecutor ruled that the \nburnings had been accidental. A three-member mili\xad\ntary court then overruled him and charged the army \nsquad’s commanding officer with criminal negligence, \nwith the army judge dissenting.\nWhile the assassination attempt enabled Pinochet \nto rally the troops temporarily, it did not succeed in \nhealing the growing malaise in the navy, police and \nair force—services not direcdy under Pinochet’s con\xad\ntrol. A number of officers continued to worry that the \ndictator’s intransigence was becoming a liability to \nthe future of the armed forces. Some officers were con\xad\ncerned at Pinochet’s overreaction to the assassination \nattempt, and junta members reportedly persuaded him \nto “flexibilize” the state of siege, release prominent \nprisoners like Lagos, and drop some of the more \nextreme measures he had ordered, including scrap\xad\nping political laws being prepared by a government \ncommission.\nBy early October, three junta members had called \nagain for dialogue with the opposition, and General \nMatthei declared such talks were needed to “fulfill \nthe wishes of the immense majority of Chileans who \nwant a peaceful solution.” The same day, however, \nPinochet replaced the army representative to the \njunta—the only member he is empowered to switch— \nwith hardliner General Humberto Gordon Rubio, head \nof the secret police. Then he announced the retire\xad\nment of nine senior officers, including Generals Gas\xad\nton Frez and Luis Danus, respected and independent- \nminded army generals. Instead of listening to his con\xad\nstructive critics, the President once again signaled his \ndetermination to retain an iron grip over his most \nimportant power base.\nTHE OPPOSITION\nFor the democratic opposition, the wave of repres\xad\nsion unleashed in September was only one in a series \nof reverses that had been accumulating since 1983, \nwhen initial talks between regime officials and civilian \nleaders collapsed. In August, 1985, 11 parties from\nmoderate socialists to traditional conservatives had \njoined forces to sign the National Accord for Full \nTransition to Democracy, which urged immediate and \nlong-range reforms and outlined compromises in a \nnumber of sensitive areas, like control of private prop\xad\nerty, for a future civilian government. Relying on a \ntime-tested strategy of indifference, Pinochet flatly \nrejected the proposal. Nine months later, in April, \n1986, when a group of 18 civic groups, labor unions \nand professional associations formed the Assembly of \nCivility and presented the regime with a list of demands, \nthe response was identical.\nFloundering in the power vacuum that resulted from \nthese systematic rejections, the opposition remained \nweakened by a number of perennial internal argu\xad\nments. With their mutual suspicions fanned by gov\xad\nernment rhetoric and their claims to leadership \nimpossible to prove because of legal prohibitions on \nparty activity, political leaders across the spectrum \nbecame trapped between competing desires: the \nimmediate, instinctive need to outdo their rivals, and \nthe long-term, rational need to band together to tip \nthe scales of power against Pinochet. By the fall of \n1986, many opposition leaders privately conceded that \nPinochet was likely to remain in office at least three \nmore years.\nAmong conservatives, many of whom dislike mili\xad\ntary rule but are equally appalled by violent protest \nand alarmed at the prospect of a return to socialist \ndomination, the choice between joining the opposition \nopenly and tolerating Pinochet quietly has been dif\xad\nficult. The inclusion of two important rightist groups, \nthe National party and the National Union party, in \nthe National Accord gave the opposition new clout \nand credibility with the armed forces, but conserva\xad\ntives remain skittish about joining forces with the \nsocialist left; thus their loyalty to the opposition has \nremained tenuous.\nIn principle, many conservatives have come to regard \nPinochet’s rule as more of a lure than a deterrent to \nleftist extremism. But even before the arms discov\xad\neries and the assassination attempt, the right had \nhindered efforts like the National Accord by refusing \nto deal with any parties that accepted a role for the \nMarxist left The events of September made them even \nmore vulnerable to regime charges of an unpatriotic \nalliance with suspect groups. During 1986, National \nUnion leaders made several independent approaches \nto the armed forces, angering other opposition parties \nand diluting their unity.\nThe center, dominated by the large and amorphous \ngroup of Christian Democrats, had been increasingly \nplagued by two problems: personality disputes among \nits many leaders, and a strategic split between pro\xad\ngressive militants—nicknamed the “long-haired” fac\xad\ntion, who favored an alliance with the left and its \ntactics of labor strikes and street protests, and more\n', 'Pinochet’s  Grip on Chile 19\ntraditional members—the “pot-bellied” faction, who \npreferred persuasion and petition to eliminate Pi\xad\nnochet. One group was convinced that Pinochet would \nnever concede unless he were forced out; the other \nwas convinced he would never concede to force.\nThe Christian Democrats, members of a reformist \nand multiclass party with close ties to the Roman \nCatholic Church, were a dominant factor behind the \nNational Accord and a logical bridge for opposition \nforces. They were also a comfortable choice for United \nStates backing; Washington had promoted the Chris\xad\ntian Democratic movement throughout Latin Amer\xad\nica in the 1960’s. But instead of capitalizing on this \npotential, party leaders could not live down the bitter \ndivisions created by the disastrous Allende years and \nthe coup. Torn between left and right, they tried to \nappease constituents on both sides of the party, and \nthus aroused everyone’s enmity.\nEqually debilitating are the divisions among the \nChilean left, which bore the brunt of repression from \nthe first days of the dictatorship and which lost \nhundreds of leaders to firing squads, prisons, disap\xad\npearance and exile. Today the left is splintered and \nincoherent, with at least a dozen personal and ideo\xad\nlogical factions and with an even more fundamental \nsplit between the moderate socialists who favor non\xad\nviolent protest and have joined the National Accord, \nand the Marxist—Leninist groups, who have left open \nthe option of armed insurrection.\nIn 1980, after decades of election-oriented politics \nand seven years of brutal military persecution, the \nCommunist party switched to a strategy of disruptive \nviolence. By 1986, small armed revolutionary groups \nhad launched over 2,000 bombing attacks, generally \nconfined to power generators and other public prop\xad\nerty. Then in August, the government reported that \nit had uncovered eight revolutionary arsenals con\xad\ntaining up to 70 tons of weapons. At the time, many \nmembers of the democratic opposition suggested that \nthe government had exaggerated the discoveries. But \nwith the September 6 attack on Pinochet, the revo\xad\nlutionary left leaped squarely over the line from sabo\xad\ntage to guerrilla war and shattered opposition hopes \nof salvaging Chile’s Marxist parties from a snowball\xad\ning logic of violence.\nFor the past three years, Pinochet and his aides \nhave devoted extraordinary efforts to blurring the dis\xad\ntinction between the extreme and the nonviolent left, \nand the clear loser has been the moderate Socialist \nparty. For their efforts to back the National Accord, \nthe Socialists have been increasingly perceived by \nimpoverished urban supporters as making too many \nconcessions to the government. For their refusal to \ndisavow entirely the Communist party’s role in gov\xad\nernment, they have been increasingly viewed by mid\xad\npublic opinion survey conducted by the Facultad Lati- \nnoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, May, 1986.\ndie class moderates—who were dismayed and outraged \nby the assassination attempt—as dangerously radical.\nA NONVIOLENT SOCIETY\nWith political leadership in disarray, civilian com\xad\nmitment to the opposition had diminished noticeably \nby mid-1986. One reason was sheer fatigue. After three \nyears of regular street protests and labor strikes, with \nno signs of relenting by the regime, it became harder \nand harder to convince people to attend yet another \nrally, where they might be clubbed, teargassed, or at \nthe very least docked a day’s pay. Chile is by tradition \nah orderly, nonviolent society, and even before the \nassassination attempt many Chileans were disturbed \nby the hundreds of left-wing bombings.\nIn May, a surprising poll published by a respected, \nsocialist-oriented research institute in Santiago showed \nthat a majority of Chileans did not even favor political \ngraffiti, let alone disruptive demonstrations, as a means \nof expressing opposition to the government. Most peo\xad\nple polled saw Chile’s economic problems as far more \npressing than human rights violations or the lack of \nfreedom under dictatorship. Many said they did not \ntrust civilian politicians of any stripe, and, at least for \nthe near future, most appeared resigned to continued \nmilitary rule.2\nDuring the spring of 1986, when a number of labor \nunions and civic groups formed the Assembly of Civil\xad\nity, organizers hoped to offer an alternative to political \nopposition parties tainted by infighting, too many \nprotests and little apparent success. But when the \ngroups issued a joint demand for a swifter democratic \ntransition, initially enthusiastic public response to their \ncall for street demonstrations was short-lived. The \ngovernment further diffused their impact by arguing \nthat the Assembly was simply a front for a Commu- \nnist-Christian Democratic alliance. During the July \nprotests in support of the proposal, the government \nsimply arrested all the Assembly’s major leaders, \nleaving the group without spokesmen or ralliers.\nAnother reason for the failure of Chileans to rise up \nagainst the m ilitary regime has been continuing \nrepression, a tool Pinochet has employed to intimidate \nhis opponents selectively but efficiently for 13 years. \nAfter lifting the 1984 state of siege-in June, 1985, the \ndictator had maintained a comparatively light hand, \npermitting opposition magazines to print diatribes \nagainst the regime regularly, and quelling student \nprotests with light displays of police force like tear gas \nand water hoses.\nThis restraint was due partly to official sensitivity \nabout growing criticism of human rights abuses from \nother Western nations, and partly to concern about \nupcoming votes on proposed multilateral loans from \nthe World Bank and the Inter-American Development \nBank. The regime needed the loans to continue prop\xad\nping up the ailing economy and to meet scheduled\n', '20 • CURRENT HISTORY, JANUARY, 1987\ninterest payments on its $20-billion foreign debt, and \nofficials feared that the United States and other West\xad\nern countries might vote against them to protest the \nlack of political progress in Chile.\nBy the spring of 1986, however, Pinochet was grow\xad\ning impatient with the costs of liberalization, which \nincluded an increasingly irreverent press and judicial \nchallenges to the regime for human rights abuses. Sol\xad\ndiers with camouflage-painted faces began appearing \non street comers and making predawn detention sweeps \nthrough politically restive slums like La Victoria and \nPudahuel. On May 21, while dozens of international \ndelegates to a conference on democratic restoration \nwere meeting in a Santiago hotel, combat troops were \nsent to cordon off the downtown area, terrifying office \nworkers and embarrassing the regime’s conservative \nbackers. In  June, the government unleashed an \nunprecedented attack on the human rights office of \nthe Catholic Church, arresting and imprisoning sev\xad\neral church-affiliated doctors and lawyers on charges \nof harboring a wounded man allegedly linked to a \nleftist bombing. With the wave of repression in Sep\xad\ntember, Pinochet reminded Chileans that no matter \nhow unpopular he was, he retained the ultimate power \nto repress and punish dissenters of any stripe.\nTHE ECONOMY\nMany Chileans, especially in the middle and upper \nclasses, have also been unwilling to abandon the \nunpopular dictator because of their hope that his mar\xad\nket-oriented, neoliberal policies will eventually turn \nthe economy around, and their fear—fed by regime \nrhetoric—that the civilian alternative might be either \na return to Allende’s state-dominated policies or eco\xad\nnomic chaos. Although the regime’s tight spending \nand im port liberalization have sent hundreds of \ndomestic companies into bankruptcy and increased \nunemployment to record levels, upscale consumers and \ninvestors have felt little pinch. Furthermore, after a \nsevere economic slump in 1982, economic indicators \nhave gradually crept upward, and many Chileans have \nbeen persuaded that the economy will right itself, given \nenough time to adjust.\nIronically for such a staunchly antisocialist regime, \nthe Pinochet government has gradually gained a high \ndegree of control over the private sector, partly through \nreceiverships of failed banks and corporations, and \npartly through joint private and public development \nenterprises. This dependence has added to business\xad\nmen’s reluctance to oppose the regime, while the daz\xad\nzling technocratic formulas of Pinochet’s economists \nhave cowed many potential critics.\nRecently, discussion has sharpened among private \nsector leaders over whether to continue backing PiTor\na fuller discussion of United States policy, see Pamela \nConstable and Arturo Valenzuela, “Is Chile Next?” Foreign \nPolicy, Summer, 1986.\nnochet; in 1986, the rightist head of Chile’s largest \nindustrial lobby was replaced by a moderate busi\xad\nnessman. Nevertheless, the vigorous private sector \nprotest in the fall of 1986 over possible United States \nopposition to upcoming international loans demon\xad\nstrates that, to a large degree, Chile’s business com\xad\nmunity sees its fate as deeply intertwined with that of \nthe military government.\nUNITED STATES POLICY\nThe inconsistent and shifting role of the adminis\xad\ntration of Ronald Reagan, unquestionably the most \nimportant foreign influence on Chile’s government, \nhas also been a key factor in the calculations of Pi\xad\nnochet and his remaining supporters. Although the \nReagan administration has become increasingly crit\xad\nical of Pinochet in the past three years, United States \nofficials have stopped short of punitive economic \nsanctions, diplomatic rejection or military alienation, \nlet alone the kind of pressure that helped oust Fer\xad\ndinand Marcos in the Philippines or Jean-Francois \nDuvalier in Haiti in 1986.3\nSince 1980, Reagan administration policy toward \nChile has evolved from tolerant support for an anti- \nCommunist ally into mounting criticism of a dictator. \nUnited States officials remained wary of the socialist \nopposition and in favor of a controlled transition to \ndemocracy as designed under the 1980 constitution. \nBut by the mid-1980’s many had begun to suspect \nthat Pinochet intended to remain in power indefinitely \nand that his deafness to moderate entreaties was a \nthreat to Chile’s stability and thus a threat to United \nStates security interests. In  addition, the Reagan \nadm in istration  began seeking a more balanced \nappearance in its foreign policy, which was often crit\xad\nicized in Congress for condoning rightist authoritar\xad\nian regimes like Chile’s while relentlessly attacking \nsocialist governments like Nicaragua’s.\nDuring 1985 and early 1986, the United States tested \nvarious tactics—diplomatic criticism, army-to-army \npersuasion, economic sanctions—to press for speedier \ndemocratic change in Chile. In  November, 1985, a \nnew United States ambassador, Harry G. Barnes Jr., \narrived; and this soft-spoken but activist veteran dip\xad\nlomat soon made a point of meeting with opposition \nleaders, appearing at human rights functions and, later, \nattending the funeral of Rodrigo Rojas—an event \nChilean authorities dispersed with tear gas.\nWhile Ambassador Barnes’s activities were draw\xad\ning indignant protests about “foreign intervention” \nfrom Pinochet, some United States military officials, \nlike army General John Galvin, head of the United \n(Continued on page 38)\nPamela Constable covers Latin America for the Bos\xad\nton Globe. She is the author, with Arturo Valenzuela, \nof “Is Chile Next?” Foreign Policy, Summer, 1986.\n', '38 • CURRENT HISTORY, JANUARY, 1987\nand oil industries, Bolivia needs substantial external \nhelp to take it through a transition to a new base of \nexport products. Not surprisingly the Paz government \nhas looked to external actors, especially the IMF and \nthe United States government, for help.\nThe IM F has responded positively to the economic \nprogram embodied in decree 21060 and to important \nchanges in the government’s economic team. In Jan \xad\nuary, 1986, Paz brought into his Cabinet a number of \n“political independents” from the private sector known \nfor their technocratic expertise. In April, an agree\xad\nment was reached in principle for a US$5 7-million \nstandby loan specifically to help make up for declining \nrevenues from mineral, especially tin, exports. The \nnew economic policy is predicated on the view that \nthe era of tin is over in Bolivia and that a new base \nfor the economy must be found. But aside from a \nproblematic product like natural gas, it is by no means \nclear what that new export base will be.\nTHE DRUG TRADE\nThe response of the United States is, therefore, most \nimportant if the Paz government is to manage the \neconomic crisis and to maintain a democratic political \nsystem. Aside from rhetorical flourishes, the United \nStates has shown litde interest in Bolivia other than \nin controlling the outflow of cocaine. The United States \nbrought tremendous pressure to bear on Siles to reduce \nthe skyrocketing production of coca plants as more \nand more peasants moved to cash in on the high prices \nfor coca leaves. That pressure has continued under \nPaz.\nThe Bolivian government is not averse to doing \nsomething about cocaine because Paz and others have \nbecome concerned with the growing economic and \npolitical power of the cocaine barons. Hence, in July \nthe Bolivian government accepted the arrival of United \nStates helicopters and some 160 United States mili\xad\ntary personnel to be used in a program to identify and \nraid cocaine production facilities in the vast trdpical \ninterior. Preliminary indications are that while no \ntraffickers were captured, the action drove them out \nof business and thereby led to a sharp drop in the \nprice for coca. If  this holds, the government expects \na drop in acreage producing coca plants as peasants \nare forced out by the market. This was in fact the \nstrategy behind the policy and marked a shift from \npast programs aimed directly at peasant cultivators.\nSuch short-term success could, however, have seri\xad\nous economic and political consequences for the \nBolivian government. Coca has become Bolivia’s major \nexport product and earns about $600 million a year \nin crucially needed foreign exchange to pay for the \nnation’s imports. Unless alternative sources of income \nare found, the long-term consequences of the repres\xad\nsive effort are obvious. Moreover, unless other outlets \nare found, sharp political protest can be expected from\npeasants experiencing dramatic drops in income, not \nto mention laid-off miners and other workers who were \ndrifting toward coca farming and other related activ\xad\nities to sustain themselves.\nRecognizing its difficult position, the Paz govern\xad\nment has petitioned the United States government for \n$100 million in direct aid to sustain the anticocaine \neffort and maintain the economy. Although publicly \nhappy with the results of the effort launched in July \nand “sympathetic” to the Bolivian request, thus far \nthe administration of President Ronald Reagan has \nnot pu t up any m ajor aid package, let alone the \nrequested $100 million.\nThere matters stand for the moment. The Bolivian \ngovernment struggles to end the economic crisis and \nto maintain a democratic political system. However, \nin spite of its initial political success, the Paz govern\xad\nment faces mounting internal pressures even as its \npolicy options become more limited. The question now \nis to what extent Washington is willing to back its \nrhetorical commitments to democracy in Bolivia and \nelsewhere in Latin America with crucially needed eco\xad\nnomic aid. ■\nPINOCHET’S CHILE\n(Continued, from page 20)\nStates Southern Command in Panama, attempted to \nappeal to the professionalism and pride of officials in \nthe Chilean armed forces, reportedly suggesting that \nimproved military relations might result if Chile \nimplemented a more rapid democratization process. \nYet these efforts were diluted by the approving signals \nthe Defense Departm ent continued sending to Pi\xad\nnochet in the form of joint military exercises, educa\xad\ntional exchanges for officers, and a lucra tive \narrangement to develop Chile-owned Easter Island as \na landing strip for American spacecraft.\nOn the economic front, the United States lacked \nleverage with Pinochet because of a 1977 ban on United \nStates aid, ordered during the administration of Jimmy \nC arter as a protest against human rights abuses. \nInstead of aid, officials turned increasingly to the arena \nof multilateral lending, where United States votes carry \nconsiderable weight. In  June, 1985, United States \nabstention on several loan votes was decisive in pres\xad\nsuring Pinochet to lift the seven-month-old state of \nsiege.\nBy July, 1986, with the Rojas death reverberating \nin Washington and with Pinochet issuing strong hints \nabout remaining in office indefinitely, the administra\xad\ntion was seriously considering voting against a new \nseries of proposed loans unless Chile’s human rights \nrecord improved and its transition plans moved for\xad\nward with alacrity. In congressional testimony, Elliott \nAbrams, the normally hawkish assistant secretary of \nstate for inter-American affairs, remarked that if he \nhad to recommend how the United States should vote\n', "Articles Concluded 39\non the upcoming loans, “I would have to recommend \nno.”4\nThe news that Washington was considering oppos\xad\ning the upcoming international loans also drew a bar\xad\nrage of criticism from Chilean and United States \nbusinessmen in Santiago, who contended that such \naction would unfairly punish one of the few Latin \nAmerican countries that had made an impressive effort \nto repay its foreign debt. By October, despite contin\xad\nuing pressure from Congress to oppose the loans, the \nadministration was no longer' pressing other govern\xad\nments to reject them, malting approval likely even \nwithout United States support. Privately, United States \nofficials called the attack on Pinochet a “major set\xad\nback” for the opposition, and by extension for United \nStates policy toward the Chilean regime.\nA final factor in the regime’s favor is timing. With \nthe 1989 election only two years away, many Chileans \nare resigned to the constitutional transition scheme \nbeing implemented by the government and are hope\xad\nful that the armed forces will prevent Pinochet from \nsucceeding himself. Even if it is not swift, moreover, \nthe carefully controlled official transition seems rea\xad\nsonable to many citizens who still remember with alarm \nhow Chile’s long-established balance of congressional \nand executive power collapsed into chaos and violence \nin the last months of Allende’s presidency.\nPINOCHET’S TERM\nAs now written, the constitution provides that Pi\xad\nnochet will remain in office until 1989, when the junta \nwill choose a new candidate for the presidency. If  \nmembers of the junta cannot agree unanimously on a \nchoice, the issue will go to the National Security \nCouncil, which consists of junta members and officials \nappointed by Pinochet. This means that even if the \njunta does not want Pinochet as the candidate, he can \nstill engineer his own reelection. The official candi\xad\ndate must be ratified in a yes-no national plebiscite \nbut, should he lose, Pinochet will remain in office \nanother year while competitive elections are prepared. \nIn any event, Pinochet is legally permitted to keep his \npowerful position as commander in chief of the armed \nforces through 1993. A new Congress will also be cho\xad\nsen, with the President designating a substantial num\xad\nber of Senate seats.\nToday, with the democratic opposition intimidated \nand the official election process well under way, Pi\xad\nnochet has apparently won the battle to remain in \noffice through 1989. With each passing protest, the\n4After the assassination attempt, however, the momen\xad\ntum of United States pressure stalled. American analysts, \nsurprised by the quantity and quality of weapons uncovered \nby Chilean authorities during the summer, began to scru\xad\ntinize more sharply the potential violence from the left, pos\xad\nsibly abetted by Cuba or other socialist powers. When the \nstate of siege was declared, United States criticism was barely \naudible.\npopular street chant heralding the regime’s imminent \ndemise—“T va a caerl” (It’s going to fall!)—seems more \nand more like wishful thinking.\nIn recent months, the 1980 constitution has turned \ninto a weapon in the battle for Chile’s political future \nthat could well backfire on the general. Many dem\xad\nocratic leaders, convinced that Pinochet could win a \nplebiscite only by fraud, have been pressing for a con\xad\nstitutional amendment that would permit open elec\xad\ntions with rival candidates. Even some of the general’s \nown advisers, afraid he would lose a plebiscite, have \nbeen urging the electoral option.\nAs the constitution has evolved into a potential plus \nfor its longtime detractors, however, Pinochet has kept \nhis opponents off balance by refusing to make clear \nhis plans for 1989, declaring repeatedly that he wants \nonly to see his regime’s ideas—not necessarily its per\xad\nsonnel—continue in power. Pinochet appears to be \nbanking on an improvement in the economy and a \ncontinued escalation in leftist terrorism to give him \nthe opportunity to present voters with a choice between \nhimself and chaos. The opposition, on the other hand, \nbelieves that continuing high unemployment and \nsharpening political polarization will force the public \nto vote against continued military rule.\nToday, both sides are loath to make concessions or \ncommitments in case time proves them wrong. The \ndemocratic opposition has threatened to boycott the \n1989 elections as tainted and predetermined, but if \nthey do so, civilian politicians will forfeit their chance \nto run for office. Pinochet has said he will not permit \nany reforms in the constitution, knowing that they \nmight open the door to a reconsideration of the entire \ntransition process, threaten his only formal claim to \nlegitimacy, and force him to accept a legal defeat at \nthe polls. But if military pressure continues as election \ntime approaches, the President may well agree to some \nchanges in order to ensure the broader backing of the \narmed forces.\nPerhaps the most significant development in favor \nof a genuine transition to democracy, paradoxically, \nstems from the September assassination attempt. In \nthe short term, the incident clearly benefited Pinochet \nand hurt his political opponents. But by clarifying the \nfact that certain Communist groups are willing to use \nviolence, it may also have put to rest the most divisive \nissue among the forces of Chilean democracy: whether \nthey should ally with the extreme left in strikes and \nprotests to force the regime from power.\nBy placing the Communist left outside the pale of \nlegitimate political participation, the assassination \nattempt helped remove a serious obstacle to cohesion \nwithin the democratic forces. In October, Gabriel \nValdes, the president of the Christian Democratic party, \nstated that there would now be “no kind of pact with \nthe Communist party or any sector that espouses the \npath of arms or terrorism.” Having abandoned hopes\n", '40 CURRENT HISTORY, JANUARY, 1987\nof a coalition with the Marxist left, centrist leaders \nare in a better position to persuade rightist allies that \nthey have nothing to fear from civilian control; thus \nthey add weight to efforts to press the armed forces \nfor a return to genuine democracy.\nAs Pinochet and his democratic opponents position \nthemselves for 1989, however, the most volatile issue \nin Chile’s political future remains unresolved. Will the \nrevolutionary left and the military regime continue to \ncomplement each other in an accelerating spiral of \nguerrilla and state terrorism, squeezing the nonviolent \nopposition into an increasingly narrow political space \nand casting hopes for civilian transition into deeper \njeopardy? Or will the democratic opposition, with \nincreased support from conservative elites, persuade \nthe armed forces that continued dictatorship may \ndestroy Chile’s stability and that Pinochet must not \nbe permitted to remain in power? Over the next three \nyears, the answers to those questions could mean the \ndifference between Chile’s relatively smooth return to \ncivilian rule and its degeneration into violence. ■\nCOLOMBIA\n(Continued from page 24)\nthe Colombian political system: the progressive ero\xad\nsion of the regime’s legitimacy. While the vast major\xad\nity of C olom bia’s people are clearly better off \neconomically today than they were when the National \nFront was inaugurated in 1958, the political system \nhas failed to institutionalize mechanisms of political \nparticipation.\nGuerrilla violence is an extreme manifestation of \nthis underlying problem of institutional legitimacy. The \ntraditional Liberal-Conservative party leadership has \nretained its long-standing dominance in the political- \nelectoral arena, as evidenced by the parties’ contin\xad\nuing success at the polls and the relative electoral \nweakness of the left. However, during the last 25 years \na wide gap has opened between what is known in \nColombia as el pais politico (the political leadership) \nand el pais nacional (the nation)—between the issues \nand agendas of the country’s political elites and the \ndemands, concerns and expectations of the general \nColombian population. This gap is reflected in the \nnation’s high rates of electoral abstentionism, in rising \nlevels of mass political apathy and cynicism, in declin\xad\ning rates of voter identification with either of the tra\xad\nditional parties, in the emergence of an urban swing \nvote, and in widespread citizen distrust of the nation’s \npolitical institutions and leadership.12\nlsGary Hoskins, “Colombia Under Stress: A Presidency \nLamed by Instability,” Caribbean Review, vol. 15, no. 1 (Spring, \n1986), pp. 7-9, 34.\n13See Bruce Michael Bagley, “The State and the Peas\xad\nantry in Contemporary Colombia, in Bagley et ah, eds., op. \ncit.\n14Hoskins, op. cit., p. 8.\nThe gap is also reflected in the dramatic increases \nin political praetorianism that the country has expe\xad\nrienced in recent decades: the radicalization of the \npeasant movement, the explosion of urban protests, \nthe growing militancy of the urban labor movement, \nand the upsurge in both rural and urban guerrilla \nactivity.13\nSome signs of rising levels of political disaffection \namong segments of the urban middle class have sur\xad\nfaced in recent years. In the 1982 elections, for exam\xad\nple, Luis Carlos Galan and his dissident Nuevo \nLiberalismo (New Liberalism) faction successfully \nappealed to urban middle class voters disaffected with \ntraditional Liberal party machine politics. By rallying \ndiscontented Liberal voters against the party’s pres\xad\nidential nominee, former President Alfonso Lopez \nMichelsen, Galan split the Liberal vote, thereby indi\xad\nrectly contributing to the electoral victory of Con\xad\nservative presidential candidate Belisario Betancur.14\nAlthough this middle class electoral revolt was not \nrepeated in the 1986 presidential race, in part because \nof Galan’s own political mistakes and because of wide\xad\nspread Liberal animosity toward the right-wing Con\xad\nservative candidate, Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, middle \nclass alienation from traditional machine politics and \nclientelism in both parties remains latent and could \nresurface.\nAll these signs portend a progressive erosion of \nregime legitimacy and stability. The National Front \nand subsequent arrangements have failed to accom\xad\nmodate the new social groups and classes generated \nby capitalist modernization in Colombia over the last \nquarter-century. The consensus among the political \nrepresentatives of the dominant classes has been \nseverely strained by the emergence of these new con\xad\ntenders. The traditional mechanisms of political con\xad\ntrol—party affiliation based on “inherited hatreds,” \npatrimonialism and clientelism—have lost much of \ntheir effectiveness, especially in urban areas. The result \nhas been an increasingly volatile electorate and rising \nlevels of political praetorianism. Under Liberal Pres\xad\nident Julio Cesar Turbay (1978-1982), the state\nresorted to intensified military repression (the national \nsecurity statute) to suppress the guerrillas, without \nmuch real success. Under President Betancur, peace \nnegotiations were undertaken with the rebels, accom\xad\npanied by mild political reforms to broaden partici\xad\npation in the system, with partial success. At the outset \nof the Barco presidency, the country’s leadership faces \na critical juncture in which it must either move to \ninstitutionalize new democratic channels of partici\xad\npation or confront even higher levels of praetorianism \nand political instability.\nThe international arena also presents important \npolitical challenges. For example, President Betan- \ncur’s emphasis on Gontadora and the search for a \nnegotiated peace in Central America has generated\n']</pre>
