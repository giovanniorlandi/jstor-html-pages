        <pre>['327 \nNOTES ON THE FINANCIAL TIMES– \nACTUARIES BRITISH GOVERNMENT \nSECURITIES INDICES IN 1980 \nby \nA. D. WILKIE, M.A., F.F.A., F.I.A. \nand \nJ. E. PATERSON, B.Sc., F.F.A. \n1.1 This note continues the series started in 1976, of which the last \nprevious was “F.T.–Actuaries British Government Securities Indices \n1979” (J. I. A., 107, 315 and T.F. A. 37, 77). \n1.2 Throughout 1980 partly paid new issues have been excluded from \nthe indices until fully paid. It is intended that eventually partly paid new \nissues be included as if fully paid from date of issue, but no retrospective \nadjustments to the published indices will be made. The only difficulty in \n1980 deserving comment arose on 16th/17th December. The xd adjust- \nments for 17th December published in the Financial Times should \nhave been shown for the 16th, in addition to the actual xd adjustments \npublished for the 16th. Subsequent data were unaffected by this error. \n2. Yield Indices \n2.1 Appendix B of the 1979 note lists the constituents of the yield \nindices at 31st December 1979. Changes in the constituents during 1980 \nare listed in Appendix A of the present note. There were 11 new stocks \nentering (excluding further tranches of existing stocks); 7 stocks came \nwithin one year of maturity; and 15 stocks were moved from one coupon \nband to another to maintain roughly equal numbers in each band. The \ngrouping of coupons in bands was changed on three occasions. \n2.2 At 31st December 1980 there were 25 stocks in the Low Coupon band \nwhich then contained coupons from 3%–9%; 25 in the Mediums (9¼%– \n12¼%); and 24 in the Highs (12½–15½%). A complete list of these is \ngiven in Appendix B. \n2.3 Appendix C shows the values of the gross redemption yields. con- \nvertible half-yearly, for the ten indices for 31st December 1979 and for the \nlast working day of each month in 1980, together with the highest and \nlowest values recorded for each index during the year. The yield lows \noccurred on or about 21st July, and the highest yields on 4th March, \nexcept that the Irredeemables yield registered its high on 21st March. \n3. Portfolio Indices \n3.1 Appendix E of the 1979 note listed the constituents of the portfolio \nindices at 31st December 1979. Changes in the constituents during 1980 \n', '328 Notes on the F.T.–Actuaries \nare listed in Appendix D of the present note. Of a total of 17 new entries \n4 were included from fully paid issue (of these 2 were A stocks) and 13 from \npayment of the final call (of these 4 were A stocks); the nominal amount of \nthree stocks was increased on special further issues to the Bank of England \nfor resale in the market; 4 new tranches were amalgamated; 6 stocks \nneared redemption; and 6 stocks moved between sectors as the time to \nredemption shortened. \n3.2 At 31st December 1980 there were 27 stocks in the “up to 5 years” \nsector; 29 stocks in the “5 to 15 years” sector; 28 stocks in the “over \n15 years” sector; and 6 stocks in the irredeemables sector; making a total \nof 90 stocks. These are listed in Appendix E. \n3.3 In 5.1 to 5.6 of the 1976 note it was shown how one could use the \npublished values of the indices and the “xd adj” figure to calculate \ncumulative rates of return on the sectors for the year on two different \nassumptions about when dividends are reinvested and at two different tax \nrates. The values of the index at the end of each month and the cumulative \ninterest received for 1980 to the end of each month, for each sector, are \nshown in Appendix F. \n3.4 The cumulative rates of return for 1980, expressed as percentages, \nwere: \nFirst Assumption Second Assumption \nNet of tax Net of tax \nGross at 37½% Gross at 37½% \nUp to 5 years 17·87% 13·59% 17·73% 13·51% \n5 to 15 years 19·20% 13·99% 19·10% 13·95% \nOver 15 years 21·26% 15·52% 20·96% 15·36% \nIrredeemables 17·79% 12·97% 17·64% 12·88% \nAll stocks 19·46% 14·39% 19·28% 14·30% \nFirst Assumption: Interest is reinvested at the end of the month during \nwhich it has gone “ex div”. \nSecond Assumption: Interest is held as a credit until the end of the month \nfollowing that in which it has gone “ex div”. \nIt can be seen that the first assumption gives results somewhat higher \nthan those under the second assumption, with the differences ranging from \n0·04% more for “5 to 15 years” (Net) to 0·30% more for “over 15 years” \n(Gross.) \n', 'British Government Securities Indices 1980 329 \nAPPENDIX A \nYield Indices: Changes in Constituents during 1980 \nNumbers in parentheses indicate the numbers of stocks in the low, medium \nand high coupon bands respectively, after each change.
