Also thematised is Deleuze’s \ntheorisation of film, particularly its transgressive potential, in Cinema 1: The \nMovement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image. Focus then shifts to discussion \nof the further development of scholarship on these ideas, particularly taking into \naccount the rise of digital technologies alongside what Deleuze termed societies of \ncontrol. Central to such scholarship is contention surrounding whether or not digital \nmedia are capable of communicating duration and countering State apparatus \nthought in a manner akin to their analogue predecessors, in a way that makes the \ncreation of digital war machines possible. After touching on this debate and taking a \nstandpoint in relation to it, the article then moves on to consider Jacques Perrin and \nJacques Cluzaud’s film Oceans (2009) as a digital aesthetic war machine.\nKey words: War machine; control society; analogue; digital; duration; aesthetic; \nnomadism; Oceans\n', '18\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nINTRODUCTION\nIn his work with Félix Guattari, Gilles Deleuze advances the idea of nomadic war \nmachines as constructs that entail both the appropriation of aspects of the State \napparatus, and their mutation and combination into novel forms of difference. In \nthis regard, the minor literature of Franz Kafka, the intensity art of Francis Bacon, \nand the becoming-animal music of Olivier Messiaen, along with what Deleuze calls \nmodern political cinema, receive particular emphasis. Perhaps the most important \ncomponent of such war machines, regardless of their form, is the durationality they \nthematise. That is, the reflexive interplay between the virtual past and the actual \npresent which these war machines evince, and which gives rise to new thought – \nthrough both the violence of the conceptual constraint which precipitates their birth, \nand the corresponding violence that such war machines in turn wield against the \nrelative integrity of State apparatus thought. \nThat said, toward the end of his life Deleuze intimated concern over the efficacy \nof such aesthetic war machines to usher in new ways of thinking in the digital \ninformation age of control societies. This was not least because, for him, the digital \nera entailed the supplanting of durational reflection by informational thinking, \nand involved the correlative phenomenon of dividualisation, or the reduction of \nindividual difference to the homogeneity of continuously monitored and coded \neconomic matter. Admittedly, Deleuze did allude to the importance of producing \ncounter-information, and to the possibility of certain new war machines effecting \nsuch production, but he failed to elaborate on this issue before his death in 1995.\nHowever, 1995 was also the year in which several public search engines \nwere launched among other cyber-innovations that facilitated unprecedented \nlevels of divergent cyber-interactivity, which in many respects problematised \nDeleuze’s conception of digitality as a medium of controlling uniformity. Indeed, \nrecent Deleuzian scholarship has explored the existence of cyber war machines – \nmost notably noise, viruses and piracy – as producing diverse forms of counterinformation.\nIn keeping with this research trajectory, the focus of the current article \nfalls on: (a) the issue of whether or not such cyber war machines can ever replace \naesthetic war machines such as those identified in the respective works of Kafka, \nBacon, and Messiaen,1 and reflected in modern political cinema; (b) what form the \naesthetic war machines of the future will have to take to remain effective catalysts \nof difference, given what Deleuze calls societies of control; and (c) the extent to \nwhich Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud’s film Oceans (2009) approximates such \n1 Among others of Kafka’s works, Deleuze and Guattari (2003, 7-8) focus on Amerika, The Trial, \nThe Castle and In the Penal Colony in their exploration of what they term “[a] Kafka-machine”. \nApart from Bacon’s Screaming Pope portraits, other important examples of his work are his \nTriptychs of 1973 and 1976, and Two Studies of George Dyer with a Dog from 1968 (Porter 2009, \n66). Examples of Messiaen’s work are those from the 1940s to 1960s incorporating birdsong, and \nalso his From the Canyons to the Stars… of the 1970s (Bogue 2007,29–30).\n', '19\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\na new aesthetic war machine, through its countering of the State apparatus thought \nof control society in a manner akin to the war machines of Kafka, Bacon, Messiaen \nand modern political cinema, but with far greater reach, impact and durability on \naccount of its digital format.\nTo explore the above, firstly, what will be discussed are the Bergsonian durational \ndynamics of such older aesthetic nomadic war machines. Accordingly, focus will \nfall on the minor literature of Franz Kafka, the intensity art of Francis Bacon, the \nbecoming-animal music of Olivier Messiaen, and on modern political cinema, \nalong with their constitutive features. Secondly, discussion will move to Deleuze’s \ntheorisation of the advent of control societies within the digital information age, \nand then shift on to how recent Deleuzian scholars have thematised the emergence \nof new cyber war machines as sources of the counter-information Deleuze pointed \nto in his final years. Thirdly, the article will consider whether or not such cyber war \nmachines can ever replace aesthetic war machines, and what form the aesthetic war \nmachines of the future will have to take in order to remain effective catalysts of \ndifference within the context of control society. In this respect, Perrin and Cluzaud’s \ndigital film, Oceans, will be advanced as an example of such a new aesthetic war \nmachine. \nDURATION AND NOMADIC WAR MACHINES \nFor Deleuze (and Guattari), drawing on the work of Henri Bergson, the virtual and \nactual are operative words that denote, respectively, a “past [which] co-exist[s] with \nthe present” and a “present…which does not cease to pass” (Deleuze 1991, 59). \nThus, while the actual present passes into the virtual past, constantly deepening \nand broadening its parameters, this expanding virtual past also always persists with \nthe present, as the constantly contextualising lens through which we continually \nexperience our existence, and ultimately arrive at durational intuition.2 This applies \nas much to the individual as to the society they inhabit, because the related forms \nof societal organisation and accompanying cultural mores are similarly the actual \nexplications in the passing present of certain genetic memories. Such memories \nare contained in a virtual past, coinciding with the present and comprising a key \nreference point when social patterns are challenged by new actual requirements, \nfor which no precedent exists but to which response is obligatory. In relation to \nsuch dynamics, Bergson in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion distinguishes \n2 As Bergson explains, it is over the virtual past that “we tend to scatter ourselves…in the measure \nthat we detach ourselves from our sensory and motor state”, and it is in the actual present that \n“we tend to concentrate ourselves…in the measure that we attach ourselves more firmly to the \npresent reality, responding by motor reactions to sensory stimulation” (Bergson 2005, 162–163). \nAccordingly, “time is…identical with the continuity of our inner life”, of “memory within change \nitself…that prolongs the before into the after”, and for Bergson all “that is naturally experienced” \nin this way “is duration” (Bergson 1965, 44).\n', '20\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nbetween “closed and open societies” that are informed, respectively, more by instinct \nthan intelligence, and more by intelligence than instinct (Bergson 1932, 137–141). \nAnd he contends that progressive adaptation to the unanticipated is the mark of \nthe latter, as the innovation involved constitutes an actual seed that crystallises a \nvirtual social environment in a new memorial configuration. Further, the openness \nto change, inseparable from such a new memorial configuration, can also constitute \na virtual seed that, in turn, subsequently crystallises other actual environments, in \nprogressively more open and innovative configurations.\nThat said, Deleuze and Guattari (2000, 217, 219) believe that over the centuries, \nthe possible parameters of actual social change have for the most part consistently \nbeen circumscribed by the virtual seed of “the primordial Urstaat, the eternal model \nof everything the State wants to be and desires”, which has explicated itself in various \nactual social formations including “the famous five stages [of Marxism]: primitive \ncommunism, ancient city-states, feudalism, capitalism, and socialism”. It is in this \nsense “that, spiritual or temporal, tyrannical or democratic, capitalist or socialist, \nthere has never been but a single State”, the apparatuses of which have always \nsought to canalise desire, albeit in different ways at different historical junctures \n(Deleuze and Guattari 2000, 192). Consequently, while for Deleuze and Guattari \n“history is a molar majoritarian state apparatus”, they regard “revolution [a]s \na-historical because it is a molecular minoritarian becoming”; for them “minority \nand revolution are both becomings” on account of their incremental but persistent \nintroduction of new assemblages (Watson 2010, 174).3 In particular, Deleuze \nconsiders the events of May 1968 a case in point,4 arguing that at that moment \n“the question [wa]s not to seek the truth like Sartre, but to produce new conditions \nfor statements”, and that “1968 produced new statements…that no one had used \nbefore” (Deleuze 2007, 284). Similarly, Michel Foucault advances that May 1968 \nwas deeply transformative because it involved “ask[ing] politics a whole series of \nquestions that were not traditionally a part of its statutory domain”, ranging from \nissues of gender, racial and sexual inequality, to problems of hierarchical societal \n3 For Deleuze and Guattari (2003, 16–18, 81), “[a]n assemblage…has two sides: it is a collective \nassemblage of enunciation [and]…a machinic assemblage of desire” which arise in relation to an \n“impasse” – often presented by the State apparatus – to which assemblages respond by rendering \n“everything in them” thoroughly “political” so that a new contestatory “collective enunciation” is \nprecipitated. \n4 The events of May 1968 in Paris were of unparalleled scale and effect. For three weeks millions \nof “workers, teachers and students held a general strike that…closed down French transport, \nindustry and education”, resulting in “the resignation of Charles De Gaulle’s authoritarian rightwing\ngovernment, improved wages and conditions, an end to the war in Vietnam, reform of \nthe education system and an end to police brutality” (Varney 2011, 45). Marxism underpinned \nsignificant aspects of such opposition but it was ultimately “the turn to ethics” that constituted the \n“unmistakable legacy of the dialectics sparked by les événements of May 1968” (Bourg 2007). As \nwill be discussed, the Deleuzoguattarian nomadic war machine comprised a key concept in this \nregard.\n', '21\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\norganisation and environmental degradation. Foucault (1984b, 115) also believed \nit was a significantly catalytic event, since it resulted in an attempt “to rewrite all \nthese problems in the vocabulary of a theory…derived more or less directly from \nMarxism”, and correlatively exposed “a more and more manifest powerlessness \non the part of Marxism to confront these problems”. To be sure, Louis Althusser’s \nconcept of the Ideological State Apparatuses – as a network of mutually reinforcing \nsites and conceptual constellations collectively weaving the dream of capitalist \nideology from which it is so difficult to awake (Althusser 1970, 100–120) – \ncontinued to loom large in the popular imagination of the time, and channelled much \nof the protesters’ activism. Yet the need for a coherent response to the ever more \napparent deficits of Marxism also prompted Deleuze and Guattari, among others, to \nexplore the limitations of precisely such channelling of political desire in relation \nto the virtual seed of the Urstaat, along with how the formation of new desires had \nevidently exceeded the containment capacities of both capitalism and Marxism.\nIn this sense, as Ian Buchanan (2008, 1, 7) explains, Deleuze and Guattari’s \n“Anti-Oedipus is a May ’68 book” that “did provide a coherent response to th[ose] \nevents”. In this text, they thematised how such channelling of energy entails a \nprocedure “functionally equivalent to the Althusserian concept of ‘interpellation’, \nwith the [fascist] body without organs standing in the place of ideology” (Buchanan \n2008, 61), at least insofar as it denotes a limiting genetic idea or principle.5 Briefly, it \ncoexists virtually with the present as a powerful memorial inclination, and continually \nexplicates itself in the formation of the actual limiting social configurations and \ncorresponding desires of the State apparatus. Yet, Deleuze and Guattari understand \nthe fascist body-without-organs (or ideology) as explicating itself in both capitalist \nand Marxist frameworks, among other stratifications of desire/discourse/etcetera. \nThus, for them, what is “revolutionary” necessarily occurs “outside the framework \nof Marxist materialism and the usual sense of ‘politics’” (Aldea 2011, 144), and in \nrelation to time or the Bergsonian concept of duration.\nAccordingly, what these theorists consider war machines are the revolutionary \ntools of nomadic minorities, whose nomadism derives from the impossibility of \naligning themselves with, or of being accommodated within, the State apparatus. \nTo understand this, the botanical concepts employed by Deleuze and Guattari are \n5 Deleuze and Guattari’s term body-without-organs derives from Antonin Artaud’s 1947 radio play \nentitled To Have Done With the Judgment of God, and denotes “what remains when the body is \nstripped of all its organs” to become a “pure naked surface, [or] surface of inscription”; in effect, \n“[d]ivested of that arrangement of organs which makes of it an organism the body remains as a \npure surface of intensity” (Patton 2001b, 1092). But in contrast to the infinite creative possibility \nof such pure “[s]mooth space”, which “is essentially fluid, heterogeneous, [and] without center \nor dimensional coordinates”, a fascist/cancerous body-without-organs entails a genetic principle \nof organisation which limits such possibility through its explication – most notably in “striated \nspace” which “is stable, homogeneous and crisscrossed with organizational grids” (Bogue 2007, \n50).\n', '22\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nhelpful. By virtue of eschewal of the arborescent traditions of the State apparatus \n(which involve restrictive disciplinary roots, strong centralising tendencies and \nlargely static branching rituals), the nomadic formation of new rhizomatic sociocultural,\npolitico-economic, and aesthetic-philosophical dynamics can comprise war \nmachines.6 At grassroots level, they connect things hitherto separated and breathe new \nlife into ossified practices.7 Importantly, although Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of \n“the rhizome is more a model of becoming than of being”, and although it “resist[s] \nthe tendencies of arborescent thought” (Sprouse 1997, 83), to these thinkers “the \nroot-tree and canal-rhizome are not two opposed models” (Deleuze and Guattari \n2005, 20). Rather, it is better to think of them as opposite poles along a continuum, \nmaking possible the operations of war machines in the liminal space between them. \nSuch operations entail “a tension between the State apparatus with its requirement \nfor self-preservation and the war-machine in its undertaking to destroy the State” and \n“the subjects of the State” (Deleuze 1987, 142). The martial metaphors employed \nhere are of course quite striking, as is Deleuze’s association of war machines with, \nfor instance, Genghis Khan’s Mongol hordes. Yet, if one considers the contemporary \nexamples of nomadic war machines put forward by Deleuze and Guattari, namely \nthe minor literature of Franz Kafka, the intensity art of Francis Bacon, and the \nbecoming-animal music of Olivier Messiaen, along with what Deleuze calls modern \npolitical cinema, then the overwhelmingly aesthetic and durational dimensions of \nthe transformative violence in question become conspicuous.\nDeleuze and Guattari (2003, 18) describe Kafka’s minor literature as involving \n“the deterritorialization of language, the connection of the individual to a political \nimmediacy, and the collective assemblage of enunciation”. In his turn, Ronald \nBogue in Deleuze’s Way neatly explains why they argue this. Firstly, Kafka effected \ndeterritorialisation through exploiting the linguistic estrangement of many Prague \nJews. They were alienated from their rural roots, operated awkwardly in the Czech \nlanguage, and remained at a remove from German, not only because it was primarily \nan administrative language, but also because it was “the language of an oppressive \nminority”, who themselves were alienated “from [their] native cultural milieu” \n(Bogue 2007, 19). And this Prague German was also pervasively infiltrated by Czech \ninflections, which, as already mentioned, the Prague Jews were uncomfortable with. \nKafka’s deterritorialising response to this situation was to “impoverish Prague \n6 As Burrell further clarifies: “the arborescent tree…is visible, hierarchical and predictably straight”, \nwhile “the rhizome assumes very diverse forms as it ceaselessly establishes subterranean and \ngrounded connections”; similarly, while “the rhizome is made up of lines or lineaments…the \narboreal world is made up of lineages” (Burrell 1998, 146).\n7 As will be discussed later, though, an additional obstacle to such creative engagement with the \npast is posed by the suicidal/catatonic body-without-organs (Deleuze and Guattari 2005, 165). \nIn terms of this, instead of aspects of the past being selectively and creatively remembered in \nthe present in nomadic fashion, the virtual past floods the actual present in a way that forecloses \npossibility of any meaningful alternative memorial articulation.\n', '23\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nGerman [even] further, to destabilize it and imbue it with affective intensity through \nan ascetic limitation of vocabulary…and a distribution of accents and rhythms” in \na way that “render[ed] the language…unsettlingly irregular” (Bogue 2007, 19). But \nsuch deterritorialisation was also linked inextricably to politics. That is, because \n“common notions of grammatical rules…and so on, are not the essential constituents \nof language, but the secondary effects of power” (Bogue 2007, 22), Kafka’s \nprocess of further impoverishing Prague German was also, in the second instance, \na powerfully political act, constituting a minoritarian challenge to the linguistic \norganisational plane of the majority. And thirdly, through such means, Kafka’s \narticulations gave birth to “collective assemblages of enunciation, fashioning not \nan individual voice but the voice of a people to come…a people in the process of \nbecoming other” (Bogue 2007, 24). This is primarily because the desires of such a \npeople are no longer strictly and successfully canalised along Oedipal lines by the \nState apparatus. Instead, within their experience “the Oedipal triangle shows signs \nof unhinging” (Bogue 2001, 111). Indeed, because “Oedipalization and the blockage \nof the line of flight are the typical outcomes” of Kafka’s narratives (Bogue 2001, \n112), rather than marking the triumph of the State apparatus, such blockage evinces \nits incremental dissolution under the persistent assault of a war machine. In other \nwords, the integrity of the State apparatus is slowly besieged through the formation \nof nomadic desires that always ultimately exceed its capacity for containment. \nIn sum, through this process, the words on the pages of Kafka’s novels and short \nstories constitute an actual seed that crystallises a virtual literary environment in a \nnew minoritarian configuration. In addition, the openness to change indissociable \nfrom the configuration of such minor literature, also constitutes a virtual seed that \nin turn has the power to subsequently crystallise other actual literary endeavours in \nanalogously progressive and more open configurations.\nSimilarly, in relation to Francis Bacon’s intensity art, Deleuze (2004, 8) argues \nthat both the fall of religious metanarratives which previously demanded art to be \nrepresentational, and the usurping of art by photographic documentary representation, \nconfronted modern art with an impasse. Rendered redundant by technological \ndevelopments on the one hand, and devoid of its erstwhile salvific mission on the \nother, modern art responded to such impossibilities through increasing abstraction, \nof which Bacon’s focus on intensities is one example. On account of its evocative \nfigural power, for Deleuze, Bacon’s art constitutes a war machine that engages with, \nbreaks down, and exceeds the figurative parameters of traditional representational \nart linked to the State apparatus. In fact, it is in relation to Bacon’s art specifically \nthat “Deleuze lays out in most detail his understanding of the figural in contrast to \nthe figurative, and also examines the techniques and practices associated with the \nwork of creating the figural” (Bell 2011, 16). Bacon’s figural art can be understood as \noperating in the liminal space between chaos and ordered figurative representation, \nby means of free marks. Through these, Bacon guards against the canalising virtual \n', '24\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nclichés produced through the arborescent art tradition tied to the State apparatus, \nwhich incline artists toward representation. Admittedly, Bacon does explain that \nthese free marks “have to be made rather quickly on the image being painted so as \nto destroy the nascent figuration in it and to give the Figure a chance” to emerge, \nand thus they need to be “accidental…because they depend on the act of chance \nand express nothing regarding the visual image” (cited in Deleuze 2004, 93–94). \nHowever, the extent to which the artist accomplishes them through accident is \namplified subsequently, as such fortuitous marks in turn are allowed to function as \nthe virtual seed which crystallises the actual painting in a radically different way. In \nBacon’s works there occur “different syntheses of sensation…in different paintings: \na painting…composed of a single Figure is composed of vibration, that which is \ncomposed of two Figures is composed of resonance and the triptychs are composed \nof forced movement” (Clay 2010, 144). Yet in all cases, Bacon’s deterritorialising \n“art is about the search for intensity, the desire to get beyond depiction to a different \norder of understanding about the bestiality of humanity”, and “the violence it has \nwrought on bodies, psyches and selves” (Moore 2013), through its aversion to virtual \nintensities that exceed – or even threaten to exceed – the containment strategies of \nthe State apparatus. And insofar as Bacon responded by bringing “painting closer \nto movement and action in life, to the materiality of affect and sensation…in a way \nthat…provokes thought” (Moore 2013), his art is a war machine. It is one both \ndeeply political and part of a collective enunciation of an emergent people who are \nincreasingly open to seeing things differently, in relation to new and unanticipated \nvirtual seeds and their isomorphic explications.\nAnalogously, in relation to Olivier Messiaen’s becoming-birdsong music, \nDeleuze and Guattari hear the workings of a deeply deterritorialising war machine \n– one which counters the limiting, orderly parameters of classicism by opening \nup modern music to cosmic duration. Indeed, they hold that Messiaen’s music \ndeterritorialises because it entails a third order deterritorialisation of the refrain, \nsince it deterritorialises birdsong that itself deterritorialised bird calls, which \npreviously deterritorialised chaos through the creation of milieus (Deleuze and \nGuattari 2005, 311–312). To clarify, for Deleuze and Guattari, “bird calls are largely \nmilieu components, fixed to specific functions” (Bogue 1999, 128), which carve \nout or deterritorialise an operational space from chaos. However, birdsongs that \nderive from them – through a further process of deterritorialisation – “are…sonic \ncomponents of milieus that have been unfixed and reconfigured” (Bogue 1999, 128) \ninto something expressive rather than purely functional. Consequently, as Bogue \nexplains, when “Messiaen incorporates birdsong into his music” by “transfer[ring] \nto human instruments the micro-intervals and rapid tempos of birdsong, as well as \nthose articulations and timbres peculiar to avian physiology” (Bogue 1999, 128), \nhis gesture entails a third order of deterritorialisation. Deleuze and Guattari contend \nthat through “[c]lassicism…matter is organized by a succession of forms that are \n', '25\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\ncompartmentalized, centralized, and hierarchized in relation to one another” with a \nview to “organizing chaos” as much through melody and harmony as through meter \n(Deleuze and Guattari 2005, 338).8 In stark contrast, Messiaen’s modern music opens \nup to such seething chaos and finds in it cosmic duration. Accordingly, for Messiaen, \nwhile meter “denotes a regular, measured repetition of equal pulses…rhythm is \na matter of incommensurable durations, irregular sequences of unequally spaced \npulses” (Bogue 2007, 42) that are the very stuff of life, as it unfolds within the cosmos. \nAnd as his music explores the latter, it tends toward the time of “Aeon, the time of \nthe virtual…a nonpulsed rhythmic time of irregular, incommensurable intervals”, in \nopposition to the time of “Chronos” or “the time of the commonsense, actual world” \ncharacterised by “a pulsed, metrical time of regular repeated intervals” (Bogue 2007, \n42). Messiaen’s music thus constitutes a war machine as it deterritorialises the molar \nsounds of classicism. Its “cosmic” dimensions render it “molecular, with enormous \nforce operating in an infinitesimal space” (Deleuze and Guattari 2005, 343), in what \nmight even be said to amount to a fourth level of deterritorialisation. In addition, \nsuch musical deterritorialisation is also political because, through it, “the people \nand the earth” become “like the vectors of a cosmos that carries them off” (Deleuze \nand Guattari 2005, 346), into the virtual past of a universal duration that coexists \nwith the present. This is an immense virtual past that, since it comprises the broad \ncontextualising substrate of all the actual, myopic and limiting arrangements of the \nState apparatus, renders critically conspicuous the arbitrariness and constraining \norientation of the latter. Moreover, such a political experience is made possible \nbecause Messiaen’s becoming-birdsong music necessarily entails a collective \nenunciation. This is because it involves merging orchestral instruments and human \ncompositional selectivity with the intervals, tempos, articulations, and timbres of \nbirdsong. Accordingly, Messiaen’s “becoming-birdsong [also] posits a people [to \ncome] whose aesthetic sense is capable of sensing hitherto imperceptible alien \nsemiotics” (Jagodzinski and Wallin 2013, 110).\nDeleuze and Guattari’s distinction between classical and modern dynamics, \ndescribed above, also has its counterpart in Deleuze’s distinction in Cinema 2 \nbetween classical and modern political cinema. Firstly, in classical cinema one \nencounters the explication of a fascist body-without-organs, in the sense that the \npeople it represents and to which it addresses itself are understood as extant – even \nif, as Deleuze (2005b, 208) explains, they “are oppressed, tricked, subject…blind or \nunconscious” – such as in Sergei Eisenstein’s early films. Secondly, in such classical \ncinema the “boundary which mark[s] the correlation of the political and the private” \n(Deleuze 2005b, 210) is maintained accordingly, so that a conversion of thinking \n8 Moreover, “the orchestral score territorializes spatial relations (polis) through the striating, \nhierarchical, and delimiting powers of the State”, insofar as, “in classical orchestration for \nexample, a spacio-political hierarchy is established between the composer and the orchestra” \n(Jagodzinski and Wallin 2013, 110).\n', '26\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nin the latter domain – for example, the development of class consciousness – leads \nto activism in the former domain as part of a greater emancipatory project. Thirdly, \nthere consequently exists in classical cinema an underpinning master narrative or \nvoice – in Eisenstein’s films it is the Marxist metanarrative – which advances the \n“possibility of evolution and revolution” (Deleuze 2005b, 211). In contrast, firstly, \nin modern political cinema “the people no longer exist, or…are missing” (Deleuze \n2005b, 208), insofar as they have yet to be formed as a people. This is because \n– as in the case of the colonised, refugees, migrants, diaspora, etcetera – various \ncircumstances have both alienated them from the people they once were, and denied \nthem sufficient opportunity to constitute themselves in a new form. Secondly, modern \npolitical cinema points out “the absence of a boundary between the private and the \npolitical” through emphasising both “the myth of origins” and “the impossibility \nof living in these conditions”, along with “the impossibility of escaping from the \ngroup and the impossibility of being satisfied with it” (Deleuze 2005b, 211). Thirdly, \nand owing to these various impasses, there is no room for any master voice; rather, \nas Deleuze (2005b, 214) explains, “the author takes a step towards his characters, \n[and]…the characters take a step toward the author” in an act of “double becoming”. \nIn this way, “story-telling is itself memory” but “[n]ot the myth of a past people”; \nrather, it entails the memorial “invention of a people” through “the story-telling of \nthe people to come” (Deleuze 2005b, 214–215). This inclination toward newness, \nand the creative difference which ensues from it, entails the explication of a full \n(rather than a fascist) body-without-organs.\nThus, the full bodies-without-organs spoken of by Deleuze and Guattari, despite \ntheir enigmatic nomenclature, are not that uncommon and relate deeply to the above \nliterary, visual and musical art of, respectively, Kafka, Bacon and Messiaen. In these \nartists’ works, durational intuition allows exploratory playfulness with the virtual \npast in an actual present experiment, while this experiment in turn produces new \nthought that informs the time of the future and itself undergoes change as that time \nunfolds. Such dynamics have their parallel in the modern political cinema of Jean \nRouch’s ethnofictions. For instance, his film Jaguar (1967) entails the director’s and \nthe three characters’ actual collective reflections on their respective virtual pasts, \nas the three young Songhay men travel from Mali to the Gold Coast of West Africa \nas migrant labourers. During their journey the three characters find themselves \n“shar[ing] out roles which they are made to confront like so many legendary powers” \n(Deleuze 2005b, 146), in a process of virtual experimental playfulness. Moreover, \nthe audience becomes increasingly aware that, on account of such reflection, after \ntheir journey “they will return to their country, like ancestors, full of exploits and \nlies”, knowing that because “the least incident becomes power” they have the \ncapacity to contribute to their communities’ memory by reshaping it in ways altering \nthe quality of its duration (Deleuze 2005b, 146). In terms of this, they engage with \ntheir own traditional virtual past as they “seek to become ‘jaguar,’ that is, cool and \n', '27\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\n‘with it’” (Ballinger 2012, 389), in ways that open up possibilities for themselves \nand others in the future. Also, they challenge expressions of colonial authority. For \nexample, after the border guard denies them entry to the British Gold Coast since \nthey lack identification documents, “they merely walk around the border station and \nsurreptitiously cross into British territory” thus continuing their earlier traversal of \n“border zones…that loosely demarcate ethnic, cultural and linguistic boundaries” \n(Ballinger 2012, 389). Their nomadic movements are thus also “tactical rather than \nstrategic” because they “move…at variable speed and direction through a [smooth] \nvectorial space”, in a way that circumvents the State apparatus’s “stable universal \nmodels in a striated space” (Holland 2013, 46–47).9\nYet, explications of a full body-without-organs are not limited to the emergent \nself-creation of socio-cultural groups, as such explications can also manifest in \nvarious other forms and domains. Likewise, at the other end of the continuum, \nfascist bodies-without-organs are not limited to the political ideology of oppressive \nmajoritarian groups. Rather, they can also involve ontological positions or frames of \nreference that provide a sense of stability and are construed as so self-evident that \nthey are rarely considered ideological. In particular, the concept of an isolated and \nrationally autonomous subjectivity, and the ensuing experience of atomistic identity \nformation that constitutes the actual explication of such a virtual seed, and which \nserves to endorse the veracity of such a concept as long as it is allowed to proceed, \nis a major aspect of the State apparatus targeted by Deleuze and Guattari. Indeed, \nin critiquing a subjectivity-orientated mindset, Guattari “concerns himself with \ndesire in the group, a group Eros that does not belong to an individual ego”, and also \ndistinguishes between “[t]he subject group [that] actively assumes responsibility \nfor its own project” and “the subjugated group [that] passively receives directions” \n(Genosko 2002, 90). Similarly, in their collaborative works, “Deleuze and Guattari’s \napproach to ethics…is heir to the tradition of anti-humanism”, which construes \n“subjectivity or selfhood…as a displaced and decentred effect of the assemblages of \ndesire, language and social activity within which the individual functions” (Patton \n2001a, 1159). This same stance underpins Deleuze’s Cinema 1 and Cinema 2 \nwhere, respectively, the movement- and time-images follow a line of flight from the \nparticular to the cosmic, or from the subjective to the universal. \nFor example, as Bogue (2003, 70) explains in relation to movement-images, in \nclassical cinema “a visual image [i]s a perception when it is treated as a representation \nof a subjective point of view”, codified in terms of the subject’s stature, position \nin space, and/or state of mind. However, in modern cinema there occurs a move \naway from such subject-centred perception-images, through increasingly critical \n9 Stoller (1992, 143) points out that while anthropologists and cultural theorists of the 1980s \n“deconstructed many of the dualistic distinctions…fundamental to…logocentrism”, Rouch, via \n“the methods, composition, and realization of Jaguar…had already made many of the same \narguments – filmically – in the 1950s”.\n', '28\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nand detached signs of composition (dicisign; reume), to the genetic sign (gramme). \nDicisigns reveal “the latent structure of every perception-image as perception of a \nperception” by rendering an image “noticeably perceptual as taken by a perceiving \ncamera” (Bogue 2003, 73). In turn, the reume entails a “perception-image that tends \ntoward a perception ‘in things’” or, “a liquid perception no longer constrained by \nbodies” (Bogue 2003, 74). Finally, the gramme opens us to a cosmic or universal \nperspective, since it involves a completely disembodied juxtaposition of multiple \nviews – both subjective and objective – at different speeds and via “split screens \nor in superimpressions, linked in varying montage rhythms that at times slow and \nat others accelerate toward a stroboscopic blur” (Bogue 2003, 75). For Deleuze, \nthe gramme entails a “non-human eye, the cine-eye…the eye of matter, the eye in \nmatter, not subject to time, which has ‘conquered’ time…and which knows no other \nwhole than the material universe and its extension” (Deleuze 2005a, 83–84). Thus \nthe gramme reflects universal duration: “[e]very image is ‘merely a road by which \npass, in every direction, the modifications propagated throughout the immensity of \nthe universe’” as “[e]very image acts on others and reacts to others, on ‘all their \nfacets at once’ and ‘by all their elements’” (Deleuze 2005a, 60). The taxonomy of the \nremaining movement-images (affection-, impulse-, action-, reflection-, and relationimages)\ntraces analogous progression from the particular to the universal, via the \nsigns of composition and genetic signs of each.\nA similar progression informs the taxonomy of time-images, articulated by \nDeleuze (2005b, 2) in Cinema 2. Although Deleuze calls time-images “a cinema of \nthe seer and no longer of the agent”,10 they should not be misunderstood as reflecting \nsubjective mnemonic dynamics. Drawing on Bergson, Deleuze emphasises precisely \nthat “[s]ubjectivity is never ours” because “it is time, that is, the soul or the spirit, the \nvirtual” (Deleuze 2005b, 80). In other words, “[t]ime is not the interior in us, but just \nthe opposite, the interiority in which we are, in which we move, live and change” \n(Deleuze 2005b, 80). Admittedly, Deleuze does thematise seemingly subjective \ntime-images, in Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959) for example, where \n“[t]here are two characters, but each has his or her own memory which is foreign to \nthe other” (Deleuze 2005b, 113–114) – one of the atomic attack on Hiroshima and \nthe other of the Nazi occupation of France. Consequently, while they do share an \nactual passing present, each experiences it differently because their respective virtual \npasts persist powerfully, coalescing with and mediating their respective experiences \n10 Already in Cinema 1, Deleuze maintained that the opsigns and sonsigns of post-war cinema, \nspecifically the overwhelming and incomprehensible sights and sounds confronting the characters \nin Italian neorealism to which they could not respond, ruptured stabilising sensory-motor \nschemas. For him, this precipitated a crisis of the action-image, which depended on the possibility \nof effective agency in relation to stable sensory-motor schemas. Deleuze adds that this crisis of \nthe action-image was coterminous with the birth of time-images, in which the movement-image \ntaxonomy was supplemented by increasing emphasis on the dimension of the virtual past and its \ncoalescence with the actual present (Deleuze 2005a, 209–219).\n', '29\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nof each other and of post-war Japan. But, like the taxonomy of movement-images \nranges from the particular to the cosmic, the taxonomy of time-images extends \nfrom the more subjective to the universal – with the latter comprising the genetic \nsigns of the former. Particularly important here are what Deleuze identifies as \nlectosigns. These, as Bogue explains, are “modern visual…and sonic images [that] \nmust be ‘read,’ in the sense that these images, disengaged and disconnected from \ntheir standard contexts, must be reconnected…in ways that cannot be anticipated \nahead of the appearance of the given images” (Bogue 2003, 188). Images of such \n“‘archeological, stratigraphic, and tectonic’ nature…Deleuze finds most evident in \nthe films of Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet” (Bogue 2003, 189). In these \nworks a virtual past remains present over actual sites of suffering: “sites of massacres, \nbattles, sacrifices, and executions…alluded to by voices and by shots of written texts \nor monuments” (Bogue 2003, 189). Also, Straub and Huillet “in their approach to \nlandscapes, attempt…to render visible the forces that play through matter,…not \nto arouse sensations in the viewer, but to materialize sensation in the landscape” \n(Bogue 2003, 189). Bogue (2003, 189) claims that this, for Deleuze, comprises “the \nfundamental aesthetic of the modern visual image”. It exceeds the genetic signs of \nmovement-images, moving beyond a visually explicit actual toward an implicated \nvirtual. In this, the virtual past is not of a particular subject position but rather of \nuniversal duration itself, including the histories of peoples within geological, and \nindeed cosmic, time.\nCONTROL SOCIETIES AND COUNTER-INFORMATION\nThe above literary, graphic, sonic and audio-visual nomadic war machines, within \nthe age of analogue technology, were able to challenge the canalisation of desire \nand thought along lines determined by the State apparatus. That is, through their \nadversarial co-option of elements within the related arborescent traditions of the \nState apparatus, and their rhizomatic reformulation of them into new and provocative \nconfigurations, such nomadic war machines were capable of precipitating the birth \nof new thought – or radical difference – which inspires even greater experimentation. \nYet for Deleuze, the advent of digitality in the information age posed a major obstacle \nto the movement and operation of such nomadic thought, coinciding with what he \nrefers to as societies of control. \nThe dynamics of the transition to control society, and resultant effects on \nsubjectivity, can most easily be understood when compared with the disciplinary power \nthat preceded it. According to Foucault, up until the eighteenth century sovereign \npower prevailed, characterised by emphasis on the identity of monarchs and the \nrelative anonymity of the masses except in cases of public torture, where the guilty \nparty received an identity at the cost of their life. However, from the late eighteenth \ncentury onward, the scaffold was abandoned and replaced with incarceration to the \n', '30\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\npoint of near ubiquity. Foucault (1991, 3–7, 141–156, 184–193, 200–202) links this \ntransformation of punishment to the supplanting of sovereign power by disciplinary \npower, in terms of which the governing bureaucracy grew anonymous while identity \nwas accorded each person – an identity created and elaborated upon through \nmeticulous processes of examination. As Foucault explains, the disciplining of the \npopulation involved “a field of surveillance” and “a network of writing” that made \n“each individual a ‘case’” such that their individuality functioned as “an object for \na branch of knowledge and a hold for a branch of power” (Foucault 1991, 189, \n191). Furthermore, examination was tied closely to intensifying spatio-temporal \nregimentation, involving establishment of enclosures dedicated to certain tasks, and \never greater partitioning of space in such enclosures such that “[e]ach individual \nha[d] his own place; and each place its individual” (Foucault 1991, 143). The \nindividual’s productive presence at their station was now also increasingly measured \n“in minutes [and] in seconds” (Foucault 1991, 150) and subject to mounting variants \nof panoptical surveillance.\nDeleuze, in “Postscript on Control Societies”, concurs both with Foucault’s \ndescriptions of such regime change and with his argument that the spatiotemporal\nregimentation and surveillance within disciplinary prisons comprised \nthe organisational blueprint for the remainder of modern society, from schools and \nhospitals to factories and barracks. However, he emphasises that Foucault himself \nacknowledged “how short-lived this model was” – that it had already begun “to \nbreak down…after the Second World War” and that, consequently, already from the \nsecond half of the twentieth century “we were no longer in disciplinary societies” \n(Deleuze 1990b, 177–178). Instead we were in a society informed by “new forces \n[which] moved slowly into place, then made rapid advances” in the post-war years, \nnamely those of a global capitalist economy delinked from the gold standard, and an \ninformation technology “system…whose language is digital” (Deleuze 1990b, 178). \nThe rise of global free market capitalism involved implementation of the laissezfaire\ntenets of Friedrich Hayek’s and Milton Friedman’s neoliberal approach, which \ndisplaced Keynes’s embedded liberalism that had emphasised managing capitalism \nthrough interventionism to ensure high rates of employment (Ebenstein and Ebenstein \n1991, 850–854, 898–905; Schmidt and Thatcher 2013, 18); and this helped usher in \nthe current era of rapacious capitalist exploitation and financial instability, the extent \nof which is without historical precedent (Robinson 2013, 660). Further, the advent \nand rapid advancement of information technology enabled steady closing of the \ngaps between what Foucault had identified as segmented disciplinary technologies \nof surveillance, until continuous digital surveillance was achieved. \nFor Deleuze, this transformation marked the end of disciplinary society, and \nhe argues that out of its crumbling vestiges a new form of control society emerged. \nThat is, Foucault had described disciplinary power as orientated around “a linear…\n', '31\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\n‘evolutive’ time” involving “a social time of a serial…cumulative type” (Deleuze \n1991, 160). Within this temporal framework two things were of key importance: \n“the progress of societies and the geneses of individuals” (Deleuze 1991, 160). Such \nprogress depended on rendering individuals ever more docile, but effecting complete \ndocility was very rare structurally, due to the segmentary nature of disciplinary power. \nAfter all, although confinement and surveillance informed all social institutions, \nthese latter nevertheless remained different domains between which the disciplinary \nindividual moved. As Deleuze (1990b, 179) puts it, “[i]n disciplinary societies you \nwere always starting all over again (as you went from school to barracks, from \nbarracks to factory)”. Due to the interstices between such enclosed domains, the \nvery disciplinary individual – that “fictitious atom of an ‘ideological’ representation \nof society” (Foucault 1991, 194) – became indissociable from a dark doppelganger. \nThis figure could always run counter to disciplinary tenets, through durational \ncontemplation rather than single-minded pursuit of elusive societal progress. The \ndoppelganger could do so by exploring things tangential to, or inconsistent with, \nthe ostensibly integral individuality otherwise “described, judged, measured…\nclassified, [and] normalized” through the disciplinary dossier (Foucault 1991, 191). \nIn addition to Kafka, Bacon, Messiaen and Rouch, discussed earlier, another such \ntransgressive figure would be Marcel Proust. His In Search of Lost Time comprises \na gargantuan act of durational contemplative resistance – undertaken in the midst \nof a disciplinary context – the features and dynamics of which Deleuze explores \nmeticulously in Proust and Signs. \nHowever, Deleuze (1990b, 178) believes that in the societies of control \nsuperseding disciplinary society, the intermittent disciplinary “molding” of the \nindividual as they passed through the various institutions, has been replaced by a \ncontinuous and thoroughly pervasive system of “modulation” entailing both dynamic \nand formal dimensions. The dynamic of control society sees the former disciplinary \nindividual now “moving among a continuous range of different orbits” that are \nproduced and incessantly monitored through “information technology” (Deleuze \n1990b, 180). Most notably, digital mechanisms now allow “control” to be “exercised \nvirtually everywhere; marketing information, for example, is collected wherever and \nwhenever people shop, travel, pay taxes, register to vote” etcetera (Holland 1998, 71). \nFurther, this information is employed to interpellate people to a greater degree than \never before, through for instance, “[l]ocation-based marketing and geofencing” which \n“take geobrowsing one step further by enabling developers to deliver ads, offers, and \nother marketing resources to users based on their current physical location” (Morley \n2015, 113). Such developments have occurred alongside “phenomena like the rise of \nout-patient therapy, work-at-home labour, continuous education, and house arrest”, \nall “examples of…social spread” defined by “instantaneous [digital] communications \nacross space, and decentralized diffusion into everyday life” (Dover and Hill 2007, \n', '32\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\n12). In fact, the extent to which such diffusion has become normalised is reflected \nin new cultural practices, whereby people not only willingly but indeed obsessively \nreplicate continuous panoptical dynamics in their relationship with themselves and \nothers. A case in point being “camera phones” which “are part of the technologies that \nDeleuze’s conception of control society accommodates easily” since they function as \n“panopticons in the palms of individuals engaged in the surveillance of their objects \nof desire” (Ravindran 2009, 104). New smartphone applications compound this. For \nexample, Snapchat, which has over two hundred million users, encourages obsessive \nself-surveillance and narcissism as the “application…promotes taking of ‘selfies’ \nand encourages its users to advertise their entire life to their friends” (Vellante 2016), \nby making such material ubiquitously accessible through uploading it to the internet. \nSimilar to Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook encourage compulsive “information \nsharing and self-disclosure”, and despite the potentially more anonymous aspect \nof Twitter, when used “to talk about daily routines” it arguably reflects the same \n“neuroticism” that underpins the growing obsession with “Facebook status updates” \n(Lin and Qiu 2013, 433). Sherry Turkle (2011, 405) in particular hints at the selfcensoring\nyoung people engage in when in public, knowing well that their friends \nmay take pictures of them or comment on their behaviour, posting such materials \non Facebook and the like. The economic aspect of these applications must not be \nforgotten either; Facebook, for instance, is a multi-billion-dollar enterprise (Boone \nand Kurtz 2015, 314), the success of which rests on co-opting more people every \nday. Moreover, reduction of people to their online data is clearly evinced by how \nsome “organizations use personal information gleaned online to turn people down for \njobs, insurance coverage, or loans and credit” based on statistical profiling processes \n(Boone and Kurtz 2015, 314). In many respects, such developments corroborate \nDeleuze’s idea that in control societies, one can no longer speak of “a duality of \nmass and individual”, because individuals have effectively “become ‘dividuals,’ and \nmasses [have] become samples, data, markets, or ‘banks’” (Deleuze 1990b, 180) of \ncoded economic matter. \nThis dynamic of flattening out individual duration into information that can \ninterface with the single axiomatic time of late/advanced capitalism,11 is also \nmirrored at a formal level in the move from analogue to digital technology. In this \nregard, David Rodowick (2007) in The Virtual Life of Film, outlines how each \nmedium is informed by a different ontology. With analogue photography and film \nthere is fidelity to the configuration of light that comprised the event recorded, as \nit involves burning an isomorphic mirror image of the event into light-sensitive \nmaterial. Through the production of this photograph or the projection of this image \non-screen, one thereby encounters the past persisting in the present in a manner \n11 Indeed, one of the key features of neoliberalism is “the establishment of a regularizing relationship \nbetween time and money” (Ren 2010, 110).\n', '33\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nakin to Bergson’s theorisation of memory. With such technology one also remains \nbeholden to and hence subordinate to the flow time. This is primarily because one \ncannot reverse time, as it were, since once any given moment has passed, one is left \nonly with what one has recorded of it – and this visual memorial does not readily lend \nitself to subsequent manipulation through, for example, lighting or mise en scène. By \ncontrast, in digital photography the light configuration of an event is translated into \nbinary code for storage – breaking the direct isomorphic connection with the past \nwhich characterises analogue technology. Furthermore, when such digital images are \nreconstituted there is no longer a subordination to time. Instead, Rodowick (2007, \n174) argues, there is a “will to power in relation to…past worlds”, as “the digital \nwill wants to change the world, to make it yield to other forms, or to create different \nworlds” through the limitless possibilities of manipulation synonymous with this \ntechnology. These informational images – “what Deleuze calls the ‘silicon-image’” \n(Rodowick 2007, 186) – are thus seemingly inimical both to the resistant durational \ncontemplation of Kafka, Bacon, Messiaen and Rouch, and to their respective literary, \ngraphic, sonic and audio-visual nomadic war machines.\nYet, while Deleuze evidently expressed concern over the emergence of control \nsocieties with their totalising digital frameworks, he did not suggest that resistance \nwas either impossible or futile – only that it was difficult. Deleuze (1998, 18) qualifies \nthat “[a] control is not a discipline”, and by way of explanation he points out that “[i]n \nmaking highways…you don’t enclose people”; rather, they “can drive infinitely \nand ‘freely’ without being at all confined yet while still being perfectly controlled”. \nPessimistically, or at the very least ambiguously, Deleuze (1998, 18) adds: “This is \nour future” – a future of informational control of great subtlety. Ultimately, what this \nsuggests is that instead of being “a space without rules, free from the heavy hand of \ngovernment control and social tradition, free even from the physical limitations of \nthe body”, cyberspace is an “information superhighway” offering “a…horizonless \nroute into the future”, but one strictly “governed by traffic laws” (Morris-Suzuki \nand Rimmer 2003, 157). For Deleuze, countering such information does not \ninvolve simply providing further information, in a manner akin to when resistance \nmovements publish politico-historical details concealed by oppressive regimes. \nRather, “counterinformation only effectively becomes useful when it is…an act of \nresistance” (Deleuze 1998, 18). As Jonathan Dronsfield (2009, 222) explains, “the \nwork of art resists not by providing counter-information in the form of a certain \ncontent”; rather it “move[s] in a direction counter” to that of the information in \nquestion, “such that the two [flows] encounter each other in a space set up by the \ndisjunction between them” involving “a relation which is a non-relation”. At this \npoint of disjuncture or conflict, the discursive momentum of the information flow \ncharacterising control societies is broken, albeit only temporarily, and the space \nfor indeterminate difference is once again opened up. Mark Poster (2006, 60) is, \nof course, correct that Deleuze’s discussion of counter-information was only ever \n', '34\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\n“brief and vague” and that his “understanding of networked digital information \nand human assemblages remains [quite] rudimentary”. Yet several scholars have \ndeveloped aspects of Deleuze’s ideas in view of their greater understanding of our \nnetworked society. For example, at a macro level, Alexander Galloway (2004, 8-9) \nhas considered the Domain Name System (DNS), the “large decentralized database \nthat maps network addresses to network names” to facilitate “nearly every network \ntransaction”. In relation to the DNS, Galloway (2004, 10) cites Tim Berners-Lee, \nthe father of the Web, who argued that the DNS constitutes “the ‘one centralized \nAchilles’ heel by which [the Web] can all be brought down or controlled’”. Thus, “[i]f \nhypothetically some controlling authority wished to ban China from the internet (e.g. \nduring an outbreak of hostilities)” this merely would require “a simple modification of \nthe information contained in the root servers at the top of the inverted tree” (Galloway \n2004, 10). Michael Dieter (2011, 191), in his turn, emphasises not the overarching \ncontrol of information via “these seemingly ubiquitous regulatory structures” but \nrather possibilities for resistance within such structures. He advances the “need for \na framework of power distinguished from computer engineering” making it possible \n“to account for the controversies that permeate” the “socio-technical realities” of \ncontrol societies (Dieter 2011, 191). He supports in particular Deleuze’s identification \n(1990b, 180) of “[n]oise, viral contamination and piracy” as some “key points of \ndiscontinuity…divisions or errors” that comprise “counter-information” insofar as \nthey “force change by promoting indeterminacies in a system that would otherwise \nappear infinitely calculable, programmable, and predictable” (Dieter 2011, 191). \nOther theorists agree: firstly, Mark Nunes argues that “[n]oise, in effect, is…\nspurious information” that “creat[es] uncertainty in selection” (Nunes 2011, 12-13). \nAnd he thereby echoes Deleuze and Guattari’s “philosophical pedagogy” – or rather \n“counter-pedagogy” – involving “an ethics of philosophy…that rejects the currently \ndominant picture according to which we should aspire to an information transfer \nwith the least possible noise” (Toscano 2005, xvi). Secondly, for Jussi Parikka (2010, \n124), the three definitive features of a computer virus mirror those of “Deleuze and \nGuattari’s famous example of the tick” in their capacity to interrupt the normalised \nefficiently repetitive functioning of digital information exchange. In short, after \n“[i]nfection” or distribution of the virus “through other software and protocols” a \n“routine…triggers the virus” to deliver its “[p]ayload” or the disruptive function of \nthe virus, ranging “from erasing the hard drive to playing a harmless tune” (Parikka \n2010, 124). Thirdly, as Ravi Sundaram (2010, 112) contends, piracy functions to \n“destabilize…contemporary media property…disrupting and enabling creativity, \nand evading issues of the classic commons, while simultaneously radicalizing media \naccess for subaltern groups”. Accordingly, he suggests that “[s]trategies of media \npiracy [thus] approximate Deleuze and Guattari’s description of a…[rhizomatic] \nassemblage in…A Thousand Plateaus” (Sundaram 2010, 112).\n', '35\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nPERRIN AND CLUZAUD’S OCEANS (2009)  \nAS COUNTER-INFORMATION\nThe above theorists’ elaborations on counter-information are valuable, yet a tension \nconcerning subjectivity emerges, with potentially negative implications for the \nefficacy of the three cyber war machines which these theorists identify. In short, all \nthree are underpinned by what amounts to a quasi-Marxist concept of subjectivity, \nwhich is construed as something given. Simply put, a central idea upon which these \ncyber war machines are predicated is that control society is a normalising informational \nregime increasingly inhibiting the difference lying, supposedly naturally, at the heart \nof subjectivity. Correlatively, the assumption is that to liberate such difference one \nonly requires disruption of digital informational conduits through such means as \nnoise, viruses and/or piracy. However, Foucault (1984a, 282) cautions that such a \n“notion of liberation” is problematic, since “if it is not treated with precautions and \nwithin certain limits” it leads back to “the idea that there exists a human nature or \nbase that, as a consequence of certain historical…processes, has been…imprisoned” \nbut which can be emancipated through the breaking of “these repressive deadlocks” \n– something that will ultimately see “man…reconciled with himself”. Such a \nperspective fails to do justice to the immense creative and reflective effort required to \nusher in difference – effort that, insofar as it can entail a path of immense resistance, \nis distinctly unnatural.12 Thus rather than emphasising this simplistic notion of \n“liberation”, Foucault (1984a, 282–284) promotes ethical “practices of freedom” \nand maintains that while “[f]reedom is the ontological condition of ethics…ethics is \nthe considered form that freedom takes when it is informed by reflection”.13 In many \nrespects such ethical practices of freedom identified by Foucault are synonymous \nwith Deleuze’s ethics of difference, the dynamics of which, Deleuze argued, \nmanifest in the works of Proust, Kafka, Bacon, Messiaen and Rouch, among others. \nAll these works entail significant creative/reflective effort in relation to durational \ncontemplation, inviting creation of alternative subjectivities. David Savat (2010, \n425) confirms that for Deleuze and Guattari, “what we refer to as ‘subjectivity’” is \nnever something naturally given, but rather “an ongoing production and maintenance \nof a relative sense of unicity” – in other words, “how a person maintains a specific \nform of existence in a given assemblage”. Considered in this light, “subjectivity” \n12 Bergson (1932, 137–148) provides support for such a claim, by distinguishing between the natural \ninstinct evinced among hymenoptera and conservative human societies, the activities of which \nare repetitive and focused on the maintenance of order for the sake of survival, and the unnatural \nintelligence of those rare individuals who, through durational intuition, are able to see beyond \nhabit and prejudice to embrace the Whole through the formulation of different perspectives.\n13 Admittedly, Foucault (1984a, 283-284) does indicate that under a totalitarian regime, for example, \n“liberation” can be “the political or historical condition for a practice of freedom” insofar as it \n“paves the way for new power relationships”; still, he qualifies this carefully by stating that such \n“new power relationships…must be controlled by practices of freedom”. \n', '36\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\ncomprises “a function of the different components of subjectivation that exist at any \npoint in time” and thus always entails “a political and ethical question” (Savat 2010, \n425).\nWithin the context of control society, then, it does not follow that simply breaking \nthe informational conduits of the system, through noise, viruses and/or piracy, will \nsuddenly precipitate the flowering of an innate but previously suppressed capacity for \ndifference. On the contrary, the supplanting of individuality by dividuality in societies \nof control, has resulted in displacement of the duration upon which the generation of \ndifference relies. Thus, dividuality involves a type of subjectivity largely incapable \nof responding imaginatively to the rending of the informational fabric through the \nabove three cyber war machines. Indeed, noise, viruses and/or piracy are for the \nmost part not experienced by dividuals as important wake-up calls that, via the \ncontrasts they create, render conspicuous the canalising dynamics of control society. \nRather, they comprise sources of deep frustration for dividuals precisely when and \nbecause they obstruct their complete alignment with the axiomatic of capitalism and \ntheir complete assimilation into the realm of digital information. It is thus unlikely \nthat such cyber war machines would be able to replace aesthetic war machines. The \nlatter remain the catalysts for ethical activity – understood in terms of the creative/\nreflective pursuit of freedom and difference. And while such pursuits may potentially \noccur within spaces created by disruptions deriving from noise, viruses and/or piracy, \nthis is not always necessarily so, which points toward the pre-eminence of aesthetic \nwar machines. Having said that, potentially such pre-eminence would only apply \nto aesthetic war machines positioning themselves within the two major facets of \ncontrol society, namely neoliberalism and digitality; as counter-intuitive as that may \nappear at face value. \nThat is, unlike the work of Kafka who “explore[d] a limited range of experience \nfor the benefit of a small audience of similarly placed readers” (Gray 1975, 1), \nnew aesthetic war machines – in order to be effective as counter-information in a \nglobalised world – need to deal with broader issues and address a global audience \nin ways that generate durational awareness. This is because, while durational \nawareness is required for the imagination of difference, it is precisely that which is \nby definition lacking in control societies currently. Yet to achieve this, one should not \nlike filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, either be “led astray by Utopian ideas of working \n‘parallel’ to the system” (Comolli and Narboni 1969, 44), or be inclined to reject \n“entertainment”, since “in the advanced capitalist countries [of] today…it is from \nthe pleasure-principle that change must stem” (Wollen 1972, 505). Quite possibly, \nin terms of aesthetic products, such change is only possible in sufficient measure \nthrough availing oneself of the opportunities presented by the capitalist entertainment \nsystem. In short, only within the ambit of the existing economic system can one \nfind sufficient financial backing and correlative technological support, to produce \nsomething of sufficient scale and spectacle to attract sufficient attention to make a \n', '37\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nmeaningful difference. By the same token, anything that is not digital in orientation \nor at least capable of being digitised runs the risk of disappearing into obscurity. \nThis threat also demands constant recourse to the latest digital technology in order \nto create state-of-the-art visuals able to penetrate the consciousness of a highly \ndesensitised, visually bombarded, global audience.\nIn many respects, the above can be understood as underpinning Perrin and \nCluzaud’s Oceans. This film took six years to complete – two years of planning and \nfour years of filming (Cluzaud 2010a, 8; Cluzaud 2010b, 14) – and involved over \n70 expeditions to over 50 locations (GEF 2010, 4). Though the directors may have \nregarded this aesthetic product as a labour of love and something that simply had to \nbe done to wake audiences up to how humankind is destroying the environment, still \nthe film had to be made within the context of neoliberalism and digitality – the very \nforces evidently precipitating environmental destruction. While their effort thus may \nseem counter-intuitive, it would appear that if the creators of Oceans had refused \nto work within the system, then their film – which has a most important message to \nconvey – would have neither reached a global audience nor have been so visually \nimpactful. For example, the cinematography was ultimately only accomplished \nthrough the assistance of engineers who collaborated with the filmmakers to provide \nsuitable housings for the digital cameras for underwater filming, and the help of the \nFrench Navy working with these engineers to develop underwater camera drones \n(Fauer 2010, 66). In fact, this film required myriad technological innovations. These \nwere needed for cameras to move with the same speed and agility as dolphins and \nwhales, both underwater and above the waves during moments of breaching – and vice \nversa in the case of seabirds (Fauer 2010, 64). Partly on account of such involvement \nwith the military-technological complex for purposes of technological innovation, \nthe film cost around $75 million (GEF 2010, 4). This is extremely expensive for a \nnature documentary when benchmarked against, for example, the most expensive \nBBC nature documentary series, Planet Earth, which had a production budget of \naround $25 million (BBC 2016). Indeed, this latter series proved so successful that \na feature film adaptation thereof was made for about $15 million (Mjos 2010, 92), \nwhich in turn had by 2009 grossed over $90 million (Horn 2009). Another nature \ndocumentary which proved extremely lucrative, was Luc Jacquet’s March of the \nPenguins, which only cost $8 million to make but earned well over $77 million \n(Molloy 2013, 173). By contrast, Oceans did not make profits of such proportions \n– to date, it has grossed only around $82 million (Box Office Mojo 2016) against \nits $75 million production cost. But perhaps this is exactly the point; the film was \nmotivated not by the profit imperative but rather by a desire to make a contribution \nto developing critical durational awareness, a contribution requiring immense \ninnovation and thus capital expenditure. Indeed, the financial underperformance of \nOceans is certainly counterbalanced by its success as a critical-aesthetic film. In \nthis regard, it constitutes an aesthetic nomadic war machine that operates within \n', '38\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nthe capitalist entertainment industry, but that resisted compromising on its thematic \nand formal features for the sake of greater profit, despite the economic risk that \nthis entailed. Still, Oceans succeeded in reaching a significant number of people, in \nFrance even out-performing Jason Reitman’s Up in the Air by drawing over 100 000 \nviewers in the first 48 hours of its release (Crumley 2010).\nThe status of the film as an aesthetic nomadic war machine becomes clear \nwhen its thematic and formal features are considered in relation to those of the war \nmachines of Kafka, Bacon, Messiaen and Rouch, elaborated upon earlier against the \nbackdrop of Bergson’s theorisation of duration and difference. To begin with, the film \nis deeply informed by Bergsonian notions of time and memory. In the film Bergson’s \nconception of an actual present which passes and a virtual past which co-exists with \nthe present, is extrapolated out to the whole earth and all life upon it. Accordingly, \nthe ocean depths are the gigantic virtual repository of impersonal memory, while \nthe surface of the water constitutes the point of interface between this vast virtual \ndomain and our actual human and nonhuman animal present above it. This interface \nis beautifully illustrated in the scene where an iguana – with its prehistoric features \n– dries itself on a rock in the sea while staring at a rocket taking off, with a close-up \nof its face revealing the rocket’s blaze reflected in its eyes. Admittedly, in one sense \nthe directors took a few poetic liberties in this presentation, eliding the fact that the \nsea, like the land, is presently undergoing significant change, caught up as it is within \nthe same duration. But in another important sense, what they advance here is also \nquite acceptable as from an evolutionary perspective, all of life did emerge from \nthe sea, starting “from simple unicellular organisms like bacteria to more complex \nmulticellular ones from which we are all descended” (Loke 2013). Therefore, the \nocean and all its life forms do indeed comprise the virtual past of the actual human \nand nonhuman animal terrestrial present. This is alluded to strongly throughout the \nfilm via several poignant comparisons, from a dugong grazing on the ocean floor like \na cow, and a fish whose fins are like the wings of a bird, to a walrus holding its calf \nclose to its chest like a human mother would hold her baby when in water. Moreover, \ninstead of gazing optimistically into the future on the basis of the achievements of \ntechnoscience, the cinematic narrative instead delves into this virtual oceanic past \nin search of lost time in a manner akin to Proust. Indeed, in the narration itself the \nfilm is alluded to as something exploring the other side of the mirror – an obvious \nintertextual reference to Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, which \nDeleuze emphasises in The Logic of Sense. For that matter, this allusion can also \nbe associated with Deleuze’s (1983, 52; 1986, 101) own repeated emphasis on the \nmirror-image for understanding the interface between the virtual and the actual.\nAs already discussed, it is on the basis of such dynamic actual-virtual \ninterfacing that Deleuze and Guattari advance the first constitutive feature of \naesthetic nomadic war machines to be their capacity for deterritorialisation. And \nin relation to deterritorialisation, they paid particular attention to how Kafka’s use \n', '39\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nof language destabilised Prague German. Similarly, in Oceans, one encounters a \ntwo-fold destabilisation of the dominant discourses of control society, discourses \nunderpinned by valorisation of continuous surveillance and related promotion of a \nhubristic management approach to life on earth. Briefly, the extent of surveillance \nreached new heights in the post-war period, quite likely catalysed by the first \nphotographic images of earth taken from space in 1968 and 1972, with the Apollo \nmission of the latter year yielding the renowned blue marble image (Heise 2008, \n22). For environmental theorist Wolfgang Sachs, these images entailed a profoundly \nseductive experience of empowerment for human beings, ostensibly signalling a \nnew era in which people would no longer be held in the all-encompassing grip of the \nearth, but rather would grasp it visually and conceptually, and treat it as something \nthat could be manipulated and/or managed (Sachs 1999, 110–128). To date, the most \nwidely used application informed by such an approach is Google Earth, which:\n…presents us with a non-auratic image in which the whole “radiant jewel” of the Apollo \nimages is fragmented – both spatially and temporally – into a panoply of geospatial data \nsets produced by orbiting satellites and lower-level image-capture devices, which are then \ndigitally sutured together to form the global image…The visual rhetoric of the globe no longer \nenunciates the “wholeness of the object” but rather the “wholeness of its searchability,” for \neverything that retards vision tends to be drained away. Not only do clouds…disperse, but \nthe world ceases to have a dark side, and instead we have an entirely illuminated globe. \n(Dorrian 2011, 167)\nDespite this expansive surveillance capacity, Sachs actually argues that the \nmanagement approach to the earth lends itself more to a “probed” than a “sensed” \nreality (Sachs 1999, 116). Sachs’s contention is certainly valid when considering the \nTerra and Aqua satellites employed in NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) which \nare equipped with a MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). \nThe satellites cover the earth’s surface about every two days, “acquiring data in \n36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths” (NASA no date a). Such data then \nare used to calculate vapour levels, temperatures, biogeochemistry and the like \n(NASA no date b), in the interest of contributing to “understanding and managing \nthe earth system” (Hanan and Hill 2011, vi). This feeds a growing discourse on \nhow to manage life on earth, and albeit inadvertently, this discourse has in turn \nthoroughly informed dominant modes of nature documentary production. That is, \nalthough most people remain quite distant from the inner circles of this growing \ndiscourse, few are unfamiliar with its more popular, innocuous, manifestations, such \nas David Attenborough-narrated documentaries. In these, the viewer is effectively \nlectured to for the duration of the film, in a way that is both broadly accessible and \nscientifically very edifying, having been honed by Attenborough over the course of \nsome 30 years into a polished composite of technicist and performative comparisons \n', '40\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nbetween animals and machines, and infective academic enthusiasm.14 Yet from a \nDeleuzian perspective, Attenborough and others who have imitated his style, have \nin many respects persistently explicated fascist bodies-without-organs, insofar as \nthe technicist, informational approach adopted mirrors the tenets of control society, \nso that, albeit unwittingly, what is thereby propagated is paternalistic prejudice and \nrelatedly, managerial forms of thought when conceptualising the earth and its life \nforms.\nIt appears that against this dominant documentary approach, Perrin and Cluzaud, \nunder the impetus of addressing more deeply the environmental crisis, respond with \na two-fold act of deterritorialisation. They do so, firstly, by thematising in the film \nthe genesis of the panoptical approach to the ocean, such that Oceans effectively \nconcerns both the ocean and the way it has been represented over the centuries. \nThis is achieved by the audience intermittently being taken from the early voyages \nof discovery in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, through the later cataloguing \nof species in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the late-twentieth-century \nsatellite surveillance of the planet, with such ventures characterised as imperialistic, \nhubristic, constraining, and reductive from an ecocentric perspective. Another scene \nalludes powerfully to the alienating synthetic aspects of such an approach. Here, \nwhat at first appears to be an encompassing image of the earth suspended in space \n– which may invite the idea of mastering the earth – turns out to be merely a point \nof view shot of what a boy and his father see from a steel walkway: a large plastic \nmodel of the earth. Immediately the illusion of mastery is replaced by a sense of \nhumans’ smallness relative to the planet, and hence their actual vulnerability. Through \nthis scene the directors also touch critically on other aspects of the control society \napproach to the earth, such as how surveillance of the earth has codified it in the \npopular imagination as a theme park spectacle of sorts, suggesting controllability, \nwhile correlatively preventing realisation that we are completely dependent on and \nconnected with the earth we ostensibly dominate. By immediately following up this \nscene with satellite imagery of pollution streaming down rivers and into oceans, the \nviewer, having been reminded of the smallness and vulnerability of human beings, \nnow is confronted with the sheer scale of the destruction wreaked by our species; \ndestruction that we as mere organisms on this planet – not masters of the universe \n– are going to feel, one way or another. Secondly, having drawn attention to the \nlimitations of digital panopticism in the era of control society – particularly the \nproblem of it encouraging a master or managerial mentality in relation to the earth \nby ostensibly getting to grips with the planet via copious measurements – Oceans \nabandons the scientific explanatory framework characteristic of more mainstream \nnature documentary narrations. That is, instead of expert explanations, the narrative \ncentres on a father’s admission to himself and to the audience that, when asked about \n14 Attenborough’s Life series was made in eight parts between 1979 and 2005, while the ninth part \n– Life in Cold Blood – was completed in 2008. \n', '41\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nthe nature or essence of the sea by his son, he found himself incapable of answering. \nThe not knowing, the not being able to control, and hence the vulnerability of the \nfather, is rendered even more intense and personal in that the father is played by one \nof the directors, Jacques Perrin, and his own son, Lancelot, plays the role of the child \nin the narrative. The father cannot give his son an answer, not because he does not \nknow the dominant framing scientific discourses that proffer an answer, but because \nhe is aware that such answers tend to marginalise rather than engender the profound \ndurational and personal engagement necessary for him to actually answer his son’s \nquestion. This admission, in turn, precipitates the journey of the film, which is not a \njourney of exploration for the purposes of definition, but rather one of wonder, as the \nfather and his son – together with the audience – experience the sights and sounds \nof the ocean relatively unmediated by descriptions. Indeed, there are only about 12 \nsentences spoken during the entire film, and these for the most part remain evocative \nand affective, rather than scientifically descriptive and informational. \nWhile the above deterritorialising approach to nature documentary narratives \nis also, of course, a political act at a thematic level, Oceans in addition entails \nother formal and thematic political acts corresponding with the aesthetic nomadic \nwar machine of Bacon’s intensity art, discussed earlier. Just as Bacon’s figural art \nsought to exceed the figurative parameters of traditional representational art, so too, \nin Oceans the visual parameters of mainstream documentary representation are \nconstantly exceeded. In this regard, firstly, on a horizontal plane, from the outset of \nthe film the objects of focus – be they the waves of the sea or swarms of jellyfish – \non account of their magnitude and perpetual movement exceed the frame even while \nthe camera tries to encapsulate or capture them, as it were. This technique constantly \nreminds one of the ocean’s sublime parameters, problematising the sense of control \notherwise conjured up by more traditional figurative nature documentary shots. \nSecondly, on a vertical plane, how the intensities of water pressure, coldness, and \ndarkness have formed bodies differently, by shaping them into bizarre configurations \nand obliging them to operate in enigmatic ways, receives significant emphasis. What \nlends power to encounters with such other bodies is the relative silence of the scenes. \nThis approach gives the audience the best possible chance to try to experience firsthand\nthe motions of the creatures – hiding, attacking, eating, migrating – something \nimpossible to achieve when the viewer is bombarded with technical descriptions at \nevery turn. In this way, the images of Oceans, like Bacon’s art, exist primarily within \na liminal space between chaos on the one hand, and ordered figurative representation \non the other. Thirdly, on a temporal plane, by means of free marks Bacon guarded \nagainst the virtual clichés of the arborescent art tradition, by allowing an accidental \nmark to function as the virtual seed which crystallised an actual painting in different \nways. Similarly, in Oceans alternative genetic crystallisations of bodies into monstrous \nforms that defy our sense of figuration are sought out, in relation to thematisation of \nthe immense amount of time that such virtual explication into actual difference has \n', '42\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\ntaken. Fourthly, on an ethical plane, Bacon’s art explored “the violence” humanity \n“has wrought on bodies, psyches and selves” which on account of their intensities \nrun into conflict with the containment strategies of the State apparatus (Moore \n2013). Analogously, in Oceans, one encounters macabre and grotesque images of the \nexplications of fascist bodies-without-organs seeking to encompass the movements \nof sea creatures, and for various purposes, to destroy them. These take the form \nof, for example, shark nets that inadvertently kill a diverse array of other fish in an \nattempt to stratify the flow of sea life; large-scale indiscriminate trawling which \ndisrupts the immense migratory patterns of sea creatures for the sake of profit; and \nthe annual slaughter by certain coastal communities of dolphins when they visit \nspecific coves, all in the name of culture or tradition.\nThrough the above minoritarian pushing and twisting and experimental \nreconfiguration of major techniques of narration and visual representation, which \nresonate strongly with the war machines of Kafka and Bacon, Oceans allows the \nsea and its inhabitants to be seen differently. And through this, the film helps to \nprecipitate the future collective enunciation by a people yet to come – a new people \ncurrently in the process of formation who will speak differently about the relationship \nbetween themselves and the natural world. A people perhaps comprising a humananimal\nassemblage, insofar as the deep symbiotic dynamics which connect human \nand nonhuman life forms are progressively intuited. Arguably, the features of such a \ndurationally-aware collective enunciation are adumbrated in the scenes where divers \nencounter and swim alongside great white sharks and whales, or where a boy and \na fish stare at each other with haunting recognition through the glass wall of an \naquarium. But in addition, such collective enunciation manifests in the music of the \nfilm by Bruno Coulais, which to the extent that it is informed by the movement and \nactivities of the sea creatures encountered on screen, echoes the durational approach \nof the musical war machine of Messiaen. That is, despite the limited narration in \nOceans, the film is by no means characterised by weighty silence; rather the images \nare consistently accompanied by Coulais’s beautiful musical scores. However, \nthis music has very little in common with the frequently ill-fitting human-centred \nscoring of BBC documentaries in which, as composer Pascal Wyse explains, one \nwitnesses scenes where discussion of a wildebeest’s hearing is overlaid with “the \nBBC Concert Orchestra at gale force Hollywood”, or where “wildebeest gambol to \nmarimbas” (Wyse 2009). For Wyse (2009), such “emotional guidance by music is \ntoo strong” and “lays human feelings, rooted in a history of cinematic scoring for \nhuman situations, over animal behaviour”; accordingly what is lost through this are \n“the habitats, atmospheres, silences and voices that speak naturally in the wild”. In \ncontrast to this, Coulais’s scores resonate in terms of their rhythms and tenor with the \nmusic of Messiaen, which Deleuze himself likened to an auditory form of becominganimal.\nIndeed, just as Messiaen allowed the thought from the outside, in the form \nof birdsong, to both interrupt and inform his music, so too Coulais, according to \n', '43\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nPerrin and Stephane Lerouge (In the Tracks of // Bruno Coulais – Trailer, Prelight \nFilms 2013; Portrait Bruno Coulais, Boujut 2011), created music coalescing with \nand echoing the sounds and movements of the creatures featured within Oceans. \nAs much is corroborated in popular reviews of the film (One Movie, Our Views \n2010; Eternality Tan 2010). Furthermore, well-published film music journalist Tim \nGreiving, while he did not really care for the visuals of the film, praised Coulais’s \nscore for how it spoke of and for the ocean and its creatures. He described Coulais as \noffering a “reverent homage to swelling waves and the ancient creatures that patrol \nthe deep”; likened the orchestral movements to those of “a beautiful whale marked \nwith scars from a vicious attack many years before”; and ultimately, advanced that \n“[t]his is a score you need not see the film in order to appreciate [as] Coulais paints a \nstriking picture of the deep with his music…that sits in your subconscious long after \nthe final note” (Greiving 2010). Clearly Coulais offers through the score a form of \nbecoming-animal, a skill he has been honing in collaboration with Perrin since the \n1990s, having scored the earlier nature documentary films Microcosmos (1996) and \nWinged Migration (2001) as well.\nCONCLUDING REFLECTIONS\nConsidered in the above light, Oceans falls rather neatly into the category of \nwhat Deleuze calls modern political cinema. Like the films of Rouch, rather than \naddressing an extant people, Oceans represents the different contemplations and \ngrowing concerns of a people in the process of formation. These are a people yet to \ncome, who distinguish themselves from the people of the past whose discourses and \nattitudes are reflected upon, but who have yet to define themselves except in terms of \nnew openness to both the sea and its creatures, and to their ontological relationship \nwith these. The boundary between the private and political is also dissolved, through \nthe personalisation of the environmental crisis as a private concern facing a father \nand his son that yet retains its global scale. What accordingly receives emphasis \nis the impasse between, on the one hand, the struggle of sea creatures to survive \nand the importance of them doing so to human survival, and on the other hand, the \nexplications of the fascist bodies-without-organs triumphing against such creatures, \nharvesting them or killing them inadvertently, to the extent of precipitating wholesale \necosystem destruction (Beaugrand 2015, 293). The triumph of such destructive \ntechnologies thus also entails the explication of a suicidal/catatonic body-withoutorgans,15\nor the reduction of the ocean to a smooth space in which nothing lives \nand grows anymore. Perhaps the most tragic scene in the film demonstrating this \nnightmare, is that of the great museum halls dedicated to extinct animals. These \nconstitute a smooth but catatonic space in which nothing new can ever emerge, \nbecause it marks the end of millennia of evolutionary self-differentiation. As Deleuze \n15 See note 7.\n', '44\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\nand Guattari put it, “the stakes here are indeed the negative…in the absolute: the \nearth girded, encompassed, overcoded, conjugated as the object of a mortuary and \nsuicidal organization surrounding it on all sides” (Deleuze and Guattari 2005, 510).\nFaced with this impasse, there can be little recourse to the discourses of the past, \nbecause the present crisis is a product of the myopia inherent in them. Accordingly, \nthere can be no master voice speaking with confidence and advancing a particular \nmanagerial plan for the future, since the efficacy of any such (hubristic) stance is \nprecisely what has fallen into question. Instead, the directors of Oceans – much \nlike Rouch – take a step toward the creatures of the sea, and allow these creatures \nto move toward them in an act of mutual becoming, entailing the first murmurings \nof a minoritarian voice, namely that of a human-animal assemblage. To be sure, \nthis involves no mean feat, because the silence of these creatures is the gap or \nelision which halts our thought, and violently challenges us to interpret it, before \nsuch thought from the outside can inform and thereby expand our understanding \nand indeed experience of ourselves as interconnected with and indissociable from \nthe natural world. But the effects of this process, when carried out successfully, \nare alluded to in Oceans, when fears are replaced with wonder, and new relational \ninteractions not only beckon, but also become imminently realisable. \nAmong all this possibility it must be remembered that digitality plays a crucial \nrole in the power and evocativeness of the aesthetic war machine that is Oceans, \nnotwithstanding both Deleuze’s association of digitality with control society, and \nRodowick’s concerns over how the will to power that digitality engenders is inimical \nto durational intuition. Indeed, Oceans is a digital film which has revealed more about \nthe sea and its inhabitants than would ever have been possible via older analogue \ntechnologies. Among other things, the enhanced technologies allowed much greater \ncamera mobility than previously thought possible, and much greater visual clarity, \nparticularly in low light conditions. Consequently, digitality has facilitated a \nprogressive move away from subject-centred perception-images, toward ever greater \napproximations of their genetic sign, the gramme. In this regard, digitality has in \nmany respects allowed for greater realisation than before of the proposed journeys \nof discovery suggested by Jakob von Uexküll, one of the theorists thematised by \nDeleuze in relation to becoming-animal. Von Uexküll, as he wandered through his \ngarden, became increasingly fascinated by the Umwelt or life-world (life-bubble) \nin which the myriad insects and animals around him existed, and he explored \nthese imaginatively in his now famous book A Foray into the Worlds of Animals \nand Humans. Just thinking about – reaching out toward – such other life-worlds, \nentails an embryonic form of becoming-animal, insofar as it breaks free from the \ngravitational force of anthropocentric thinking in the interest of becoming different. \nAnd Von Uexküll, as Geoffrey Winthrop-Young (2010, 220) explains, believed that \nwhile “[t]he species-specific boundaries of the animal Umwelt…are insurpassable \nlimits…those of the human Umwelt are more like an American frontier that invites \n', '45\nKonik and Konik Digital Aesthetic War Machines in Societies of Control\ntransgression”. Yet, Von Uexküll only had recourse to the imagination for such \ntransgressive ventures into the nonhuman animal realm. But today, as evinced by \nOceans, we have recourse in addition to the digital image, and its capacity to be \nutilised within deeply transformative aesthetic nomadic war machines is only now \nbeginning to emerge.\nREFERENCES\nAldea, E. 2011.
