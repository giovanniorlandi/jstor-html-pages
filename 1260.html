Try\nit and see.\nEarly Fall Flowing Fays.\nPlowing early in the fall liberates\nmore plant food for the spring crop\nand conserves more moisture. By\nloosening the surface soil, thus allow-\ning the air to penetrate, the soil par-\nticles, which contain phosphorus, po-\ntassium, and lime are caused to oxi-\ndize, which sets free these elements\nfor the plant. The soil compounds\noriginally are very complex and are\npractically, of no benefit to the crop\nuntil they are acted upon by the air,\nthe solutions in the soil, and plant\njuices, so as to decompose them and\nmake them much simpler. Fall plow-\ning has a tendency to let the rains\npercolate into the soil better, which\ntends to dissolve and break up the\ncompounds or the use of the spring\ncrop.\nBacteria, which are found in the\nsoil in countless numbers, generally\nwork better where oxygen from the\nair is readily available, and these in\nturn break up the organized matter\nof the soil into simpler compounds,\nliberating nitrates or nitrogen, food\nfor the plant. This is one of the\nmst essential elements for the early\ngrowth of the plant. It is often no-\nticed that spring plowing will not\ncause crops to lodge so badly as fall\nplowing. This is explained by nitro-\ngen being set free to a larger extent\nin the loose, porous, fall-plowed than\nin the more compact soil.\nThe moisture problem is also a val-\nuable one from the standpoint of pro-\nductiveness of the soil. As stated\nabove, by opening up the soil the fall\nrains percolate much more rapidly\ninto the soil, while there is a mulch\nformed on the surface which tends to\nprevent the water from the subsoil\ngoing directly to the surface and be-\ning evaporated. Early fall plowing\nmakes a reservois of the subsoil, stor-\ning the water for the crop in the\nT. PAUL\nmmm\na. Ml 1 I 1 1 11 ill jjfc.\nspring. Often where the ground is\na little rolling, the water will run\noff before it has time to soak in when\nthe soil is compact and hard. Those\nwho have practiced summer fallow-\ning know that it increases chances\nfor a good yield the following sea-\nson, and this is largely due to the\nliberation of plant food in the soil\nand conservation of moisture. Fall\nplowing is very similar, only the soil\nhas not quite so long to bring about\nthese changes as in case of summer\nfallowing. Where possible it is\nnearly always advisable to plow as\nearly in the fall as possible.W. H.\nFrazier, Assistant Soils Chemist,\nUniversity Farm, St. Paul.\nPINEWOOD,\nMrs. J. K.

Up to the age when\nchildren can leave school the state\nshould be responsible for their health,\naccording to Professor Irving Fisher\nof Yale university. Likewise the state\nshould be responsible for their mental\ntraining and should recognize the fact\nthat the schoolhouse is more than a\nplace for the children to spend a few\nhours a day for ten months of the\nyear.\nBetter than the ordinary school is\nthe outdoor school, which is now so\nrapidly coming into prominence. Where\nPhoto by American Press Association.\nGXBLS O BOOF PliAIGEOUNP.\nfresh air schools have been established\nchildren suffering from certain forms\nof tuberculosis or who come from tu\nbercular families have gained in\nstrength and health and have showed\nbetter mental development\nBesides the good effect on children\'s\nhealth, it has been found that children\nattend school more regularly when it\nis conducted on the outdoor plan.\nOne.of the greatest needs of Ameri\ncan cities today, in order to preserve\nthe vitality of children is the estab\nlishment of playgrounds, easily acces\nsible to all children of a community.\nIt is said that the physical and mental\nare inseparably joined together, and if\none is defective the other will suffer in\nsympathy. It appears Impossible to\ndevelop the child physically in any\nway so effectively as through active\nplay. Formal gymnastics can accom\nplish relatively little. The child must\nhave some end to gain that arouses its\nenthusiasm and demands agility and\nstrength and endurance. Then its\nwhole bodily mechanism will work to\ngether in harmony to secure this end.\nEven if playgrounds were of no\nvalue J* social development they would\nstill be Inestimable service in keep\ning chftAren out of crime. If a boy\'s\nenerglcr are not used up in wholesome\nactivity they will often find expression\nin illegitimate conduct\nThere is a movement on foot in\nWashington among those interested in\nthe welfare of the school children\nwhich bids fair to solve in many in\nstances the problem of lack of play\nground during their recesses for the\npupils of the public schools, a problem\nwhich, owing to the neglect of the\nschool authorities of former years to\nprovide sufficient space for the greatly\nIncreased number of scholars, has in\nvery many cases become a most seri\nous one.\nThe solution of the trouble, as pro\nvided by the movement is to appro\npriate a certain portion of the street\ntaring the recess time.\nThe proposed plan is to set aside a\nblock of the street roadway during the\nrecess time by means of ropes that can\nbe readily adjusted to poles set In the\ncurb In a few -seconds. The barrier\ncould thus be erected or removed by\nsbme of the older pupils almost Instant\nly. It would not extend across the\nsidewalk.\nMongolian Lamas.\nEvery third man in Mongolia is a\nlama. Some live in tents with and on\ntheir relatives, while others live in tbe\ntemples. The temple lamas are of the\nlower type. They are coarse and filthy\nand much inferior, both morally and\nphysically to the tent lamas. They are\nnot unlike those sometimes seen by\ntravelers In the ~Lama temple at Pek\ning* China. The.lamas living in tents\namong the people are of abetter class\nand are much -respected and looked up\nto all over Mongolia. Sume, which\nconsists of the\' two temples and their\noutbuildings, forme one of the largest\nVA\'-.\nand\'most Important lamaseries in outer\nMongolia. There are\'about 2,000 lamas\nliving here, some quite young, as Sume\nis an important theological school. This\nlamasery or monastery is a town in it\nself and very interesting.

From time\nimmemorial trees, vines and shrubs\nhave been used to soften the outlines\nand cover up the disfigurements of\nhouses.

A\ngood building it will grace and an un\nsightly one it will redeem as far as re\ndemption is possible.\nIn England a great deal of the charm\nof the old manor houses and rural cot\ntages is due to the use of ivy and flow\nering vines. In America their use has\nbeen confined principally to churches,\npublic buildings and the great groups\nof university buildings.

Baroness Orczy in "Pet\nticoat Government" draws a* beautiful\npicture of a crescent moon rising over\nthe treetops in the far eastern sky at\n11 o\'clock on a June evening. Tbe pic\nture is so nice that it Is a pity to de\nstroy it but the invention is prepos\nterous. Lucas Malet errs in a similar\nfashion In one of her novels. Miss\nStevens in "The Veil" speaks of the\nnew moon being seen at sunset pray\ner, "a thin slip in the east" A little\nstudy would show that when the moon\nrises at sunset it must necessarily be\na full moon or nearly so. In the same\nbook the full moon rises and sets again\nwithln_a\nperiod of two hours whereas\nthe full moon is. of necessity, an all\nnight moon.Book News Monthly.\nLittle Economies.\nA postage stamp will purchase you\nthe use of a dollar for 122 days.
