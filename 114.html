Wardenga\nLeibniz Institute for Regional Geography, Leipzig, Germany\nCorrespondence to: U. Wardenga (u wardenga@ifl-leipzig.de)\nReceived: 13 December 2012 – Revised: 7 March 2013 – Accepted: 8 March 2013 – Published: 30 May 2013\nAbstract. When writing the history of geography the subject is, customarily, one’s own national geography.\nMoreover, until the 1960s, the discipline’s history was generally told by recollecting the life and works of eminent\nscholars. Since then, the subject has been internationalised, owing a great deal to the IGU’s commission\non “History of Geographical Thought”. It has also been broadened and aligned with the emerging sociology\nof science and later the “cultural turn”; so biographical narratives lost ground in favour of thematic studies.\nNevertheless, most kept to their own national geography tradition as a frame of reference – whose development\nthey now analysed in non-scientific contexts as well. Due to the expansion of its scope, writing the history of\ngeography lost its exclusivity and became part of our everyday practice. Loosely following Jörn Rüsen (1982),\nwe can distinguish three types of narration that have been employed in writing the history of geography: traditional,\nexemplary and critical narratives. In different ways, all three reacted to changes within geography.\nChanges were often perceived as crises and thus brought about attempts to stabilise identity claims through\nhistory. Currently we see a new research setting emerging that strives to overcome methodological nationalisms\nby means of comparative studies and analysing transfer processes. Reflecting upon one’s own position is key\nto this concept. It results in a historiography that studies transnational patterns of the discipline’s development.\nIn doing so, it does not only find dense international networks of historical exchange relationships but also sees\nthe researchers themselves as agents in the deconstruction of national stereotypes.\n1 Introduction: the sexiest subject of all\n“When no less a witness than Terry Eagleton reckons that\ngeography ‘now looks set to become the sexiest academic\nsubject of all’ we should appreciate [. . .] that something interesting\nand important has been achieved. Having surveyed\nthis field as thoroughly as I could for a number of years, I\nwill hazard the corollary that no part of geography is sexier\nat the moment than its history. No part, that is to say, is\nricher in raw fascination, no part is producing research more\ncreative and interesting, and no part offers more rewarding\nopportunities for stimulating interaction across disciplinary\nboundaries” (Bassin, 2000:484).\nIt was Mark Bassin who so optimistically topped off a series\nof essays on the state of geography in the year 2000.\nSince 1997, he had continued the work of Thomas Glick and\nFelix Driver for the journal “Progress in Human Geography”\n– and indeed it looked like there had been some progress\nmade! The following essay in turn will sketch – with the subtle\nirony of Eagleton and Bassin – the sexiest part of the sexi-\nest subject: the historiography of geography as a science and\nacademic discipline.\nFirst I will give a survey of the research done on the history\nof geography since the 1960s. You will see that almost until\ntoday this has been done in national frames. Nevertheless no\ndistinct national traditions have evolved, mainly due to the\nhigh fluctuation of researchers and subjects researched. The\nstudy of the history of geography has remained open towards\nthe theory of geography and human geography in general.\nMuch unlike other subdivisions of our discipline, history of\ngeography is not done by a homogeneous group of scholars\nwho follow their own set of codified rules and claim a\ncertain moral economy. Therefore, it does not make sense to\ndifferentiate between lay and expert historians of geography\nPublished by Copernicus Publications for the Geographisch-Ethnographische Gesellschaft Zürich & Association Suisse de Géographie.\n', '28 U. Wardenga: Writing the history of geography\n– a discrimination that would moreover imply that some can\nconstruct “better” or “truer” histories than others. In order\nto understand how concepts of history are being made, we\nshould look at the practical work of our discipline’s historians\nand the narratives they produce. This will be the second\npart of my paper. Historical narratives are not created by a\nchosen few. We all do so, for instance when we write an essay\nor apply for funding for our next research project. The narratives\nwe thus create aim at processing our present experience;\nthey want to reassure the subjects (that is, us) and stabilise\ntheir (our) identity claims. I will show that on a transnational\nscale, there are now up to three different models of historical\nnarratives and three corresponding sets of historical concepts\nto go along with them.\nIn the third part of my essay, I would like to comment on\nthe emerging horizons in the historiography of our discipline.\nAssuming that the way we write history is related to changes\nforced upon us in the present, I will outline ways to overcome\nthe methodological nationalism still dominant in the study of\ngeography’s history. One possible way is comparative analyses\nof the transfer of scholarly concepts and ideas between\n(national) geographies, and I will show what insights they\ncan give us in our practical work.\n2 An international history of geography takes shape\nEmpirically, Mark Bassin was right: since the 1970s, writing\nthe history of the discipline has become more and more popular\namong geographers. Especially in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere, the reform-oriented late 1960s prepared the ground\nfor contesting notions that had formerly been taken for\ngranted, such as the strategic and social practices geography\nused to produce knowledge and deliver its content. Suddenly\ntraditional interpretations did not fit the future prospect anymore.\nBack then, this was felt not only by those who saw tra-\nditional moral economies crumble, but especially by young\ngeographers. They were many – student numbers had rocketed\nsince the 1950s – and they saw the world very differently\nfrom their teachers.\nThis was fertile ground for an existential crisis of the discipline.\nWhen there is a crisis, there is a growing need for guid-\ning interpretive paradigms. It was the heyday of theoreticians\nand historiographers. Already since the 1950s, the growing\ninterest in geography’s theory and methodology brought\nabout a heightened interest in the discipline’s history as well.\nMoreover, an astonishing number of textbooks on the history\nof geography were published in short sequence: Glacken’s\n“Traces on the Rhodian Shore” (1967), Dickinson’s “The\nmakers of modern geography” (1969), James’ “All possible\nworlds” (1972), and Dickinson’s “Regional Concept:\nThe Anglo-American Leaders” (1976). While the theory and\nmethodology of spatial analysis opened up new perspectives,\nthe study of geography’s history aimed at maintaining the\nstatus quo, and it did so by writing the history of great white\nmale geographers, painting the image of brilliant individuals,\nof ingenious professors accomplishing exemplary cog-\nnitive achievements for the furthering of science. Especially\nDickinson relied on biographies and thus continued the common\npractice of obituaries praising the “great men” of ge-\nography. Following the motto de mortui nihil nisi bene, he\npainted mostly ideal careers: veni, vidi, vici. There was no\nroom for crisis or discontinuity.\nWith Nietzsche (1982/1874), the histories thus established\ncould be called “monumental” – because they emphasised\nthe brilliant and unique, the exemplary and worthy, in order\nto preserve it in a forgetful present. They told heroic tales.\nWith all due criticism, it was a fitting way of writing the history\nof a discipline that was centred around powerful profes-\nsors and knew little of teamwork.\nConsequently, when in 1968 a commission on the “History\nof Geographical Thought” was set up at the Interna-\ntional Geographical Congress in New Delhi, the biographical\nparadigm was its methodological common ground. It en-\nabled the diverging national schools to resort to their drawers\nfull of obituaries and at the same time stress their national\ncontributions to the discipline (Freeman, 1977–1987, for an\noverview, see Armstrong and Martin, 2000).\nYet this did not hold up for long, and neither did the expansion\nto writing the history of national schools and traditions\n(Katona, 1974; Babicz, 1980). The reason was a book that\nhad already been published in 1962, yet took a while to catch\non: Thomas S. Kuhn’s “Structure of Scientific Revolutions”\n(1962). In the 1970s, Kuhn’s book hit academic geography\nin Europe and North America like a bomb. The commission\non the “History of Geographical Thought” reacted by organising\na symposium in Edinburgh in 1977, titled “History of\nGeography and History of Science”, to discuss Kuhn’s controversial\nclaims (Stoddart, 1981).\nKuhn was inspired by the Polish-Jewish philosopher Ludwik\nFleck, whose theory of thought collectives and thought\nstyles dates back to the 1930s (see Fleck, 1980, 1983).\nFor Kuhn, science does not evolve in a steadily increasing,\nstrictly rational progress of knowledge production. Instead\nhe showed that its way may be erratic and affected by social,\npolitical or economic factors. Thus Kuhn put the social character\nof science on the agenda, and this came to shake the\nideas of knowledge and rationality. Now, everyone had to acknowledge\nthat a paradigm could only be understood if its in-\nternal scholarly and external societal contexts had been duly\nconsidered. Hence there were no more universal claims in\nscience that could have been employed to declare one scholarly\ninterpretation more valid than another. Histories of ge-\nography that focused on inner-scientific aspects only, such\nas biographical narratives, all of a sudden looked very dated.\nAs David Livingstone put it, “The preoccupation with ‘great\nname’ history and with plotting progress from an unenlightened\npast to a glorious present – pursuits characteristic of\ntoo much writing on the history of geography – need[ed] to\nGeogr. Helv., 68, 27–35, 2013 www.geogr-helv.net/68/27/2013/\n', 'U. Wardenga: Writing the history of geography 29\nbe reassessed in the light of recent work in the history of science”\n(Livingstone, 1992:5).\nKuhn’s assumptions were a welcome help for young geographers\ntrying to explain the changes going on in geog-\nraphy. They also helped them shape their own concepts, as\ndid David Livingstone (1979), Vincent Berdoulay (1981),\nHoracio Capel (1981) or Gerhard Hard (1970a, b, c, 1973,\n1979), Ulrich Eisel (1980), Wolfgang Schramke (1979) and\nHans-Dietrich Schultz (1980), to name just a few European\nprotagonists. In Europe, incidentally, these major contributions\ncame from countries that subsequently established re-\nsearch centres for the history of geography: in Germany\nat Bonn and Bochum (Hanno Beck, Manfred Büttner), in\nSpain at Barcelona (Horacio Capel), in France at Paris\n(Philippe Pinchemel, Paul Claval), in Great Britain at Edinburgh\n(Charles Withers) and in Ireland at Dublin (Anne\nButtimer).\nSince the late 1970s, the history of geography has taken\nfirm root internationally (Hooson and Takeuchi, 1992).\nWhile preserving national aspects, the IGU commission\n“History of Geographical Thought” was able to raise and discuss\na broad variety of issues. Yet no significant publications\nensued. Only in 1988, under the general header “Academic,\nOfficial and Folk Geographies. Interplay of Local and Global\nConcern”, was the perspective broadened systematically. The\nstudy of the history of geography now included aspects of\nenvironmental history, the relation between society and environment,\nand the interplay of local and global conditions in\nvarious cultures and forms of civilisation.\nNow, research as well as theoretical debates went in three\ndirections: “One pointed toward sociological and ethnographic\ninterpretations of geographical discourse [. . .] the\nsecond pointed toward the interactions between nature and\nculture, exploring practical and even ethical aspects of applied\ngeography. The third [. . .] shed light on the social\nconstruction of geographic discourse, the role of national\ninstitutions in shaping research and practice in geography,\nproblems of representation and objectivity, and the myriad\nways in which geography texts have helped shape images\nof places and people through history” (Buttimer, 1998:94f.).\nThis would not have been possible without the tireless efforts\nof Anne Buttimer. Her keen sense of upcoming issues and\nher ability to win over young geographers for the commission\nproved vital to the project. With her as secretary as well\nas David Hooson and Keiichi Takeuchi as chairs, the commission\nedited a series of milestone volumes in the 1990s:\n“Geography and National Identity” (Hooson, 1994), “Geography\nand Imperialism” (Godlewska and Smith, 1994),\n“Geography and Professional Practice” (Berdoulay and van\nGinkel, 1996), “Géographes au face du monde” (Robic et al.,\n1996), “Religion, ideology and geographical thought” (Wardenga\nand Wilczynski, 1998) as well as “Text and Image:\nSocial Construction of Regional Knowledges” (Buttimer et\nal., 1999).\nLooking at the volumes edited within the commission’s\nframework, one cannot but notice that they attempted to\nadopt, each by its own right, debates from the history of science\nand science studies in general. This is especially true\nfor the volumes on “Geography and National Identity”, “Geography\nand Imperialism”, and “Religion, ideology and geo-\ngraphical thought”. Whatever it was that was hotly discussed\namong historians and sociologists of science, the commission\nand its fellow travellers tried to apply it to the his-\ntory of geography. Interested historians of science were invited\nto join, as were historiographers of neighbouring dis-\nciplines such as social sciences, economics, and cultural and\neconomic geography. The interdisciplinary work thus established,\ncoupled with an increasingly self-conscious histori-\nography of the discipline and a growing interest in theory,\nculminated in the volume “Text and Image”. The “cultural\nturn” had reached the history of geography. “Text and Image”\nalso shows clearly how writing the history of science\ncan be a gateway for the reception of relational approaches.\nBy the end of the 1990s at the latest, the study of the history\nof geography had thus caught up with the current re-\nsearch standards as well as with history and sociology of science\nin general. Moreover, it was on its way to becoming an\nintellectually fascinating field of research. This came to be,\nparadoxically, because the commission was not working in a\nself-contained manner to form an international group of experts\non the subject. On the contrary, it remained open for the\ncontribution of scholars who only occasionally dealt with the\nhistory of geography. From this resulted a very lively debate,\ninvigorated by contacts with other subdivisions of human geography,\nespecially those that discussed the approaches that\nwe now call the cultural turn (see Bachmann-Medick, 2006).\nYet amid the jubilant reviews penned by heads of commissions,\nwe have to face the fact that with more than 300 mem-\nbers from 52 countries (Buttimer, 1998:98, fn 5) most essays\nhad a national frame of reference. Nevertheless, no national\ntraditions evolved in writing the history of geography, neither\nin the methodological approaches nor in the subjects dealt\nwith. The fluctuation of researchers involved was simply too\nhigh, and the range of subjects too broad. This had two positive\neffects: first of all, research horizons have always been\nopen, without attempts at reducing them to an authoritative\nperspective. Secondly, the practice of history writing has not\nbeen limited to a few experts, but has been done by many.\nThus the question arises how and for what purposes histories\nof geography are being written.\n3 Types of historical narration\nIn geography, narrating the history of the discipline is much\nmore widespread than we would expect. As a matter of fact, it\nis very much part of our everyday practice. Geographers tend\nto construct and convey their knowledge on the history of\nthe subject when trying to introduce newcomers to the trade.\nwww.geogr-helv.net/68/27/2013/ Geogr. Helv., 68, 27–35, 2013\n', '30 U. Wardenga: Writing the history of geography\nSumming up recent research, any introduction to a study or\napplication for funding includes aspects of the history of geography.\nEven innovative studies that question conventional\nmethods of geography tackle aspects of its history – because\nthey want to stress how very innovative the proposed\napproach is compared to a presumably outdated method. I\nwholeheartedly agree with Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht (1982),\nwho, for good reasons, argued that historical narrations, being\nomnipresent and elemental, are definitely one of the fun-\ndamental functions of the world we live in.\nThus, the focus is on the praxeology and ultimately on\nhow histories of geography are generated. Jörn Rüsen (1982)\npointed out that the potential of memory is mobilised and\nput to use specifically when present experiences no longer\nfit into interpretative patterns of the past. New interpretative\npatterns have to be found that comply better with recent experience.\nThis serves the purpose of self-affirmation as well\nas stabilising and implementing our claims of identity. This\ngoes a long way to explain two findings. First, it elucidates\nwhy the history of science flowers especially in times of crisis,\nor when new research approaches are to be implemented.\nSecond, it makes clear why there are so few coherent images\non national or international levels but rather a hotchpotch of\nvarious interpretations of history, which confuses many a student.\nAccording to Rüsen (1982), historical memory is con-\nveyed in four different types of narration. These types can\nbe found more or less in any historical narrative, but may be\ndistributed unevenly and in varying degrees of importance.\nTo keep things short, I will sketch out just the three types\nthat have been – up to now – most prominent in geography.\nThey can be found over and over again in geography in the\nlast 150 yr. The interesting thing about Rüsen’s concept is\nthat it allows us to take a thorough look into social situations\nin which and for which history is functionalised. While perusing\nmy little typology, I encourage readers to consult their\nown experience – be it in reading or otherwise. I am sure that\none thing or the other will ring a bell.\n“Traditional narratives” are used mostly when a particular\nperspective is in danger of becoming outdated. All over\nthe Western world, traditional narrations are employed by\nauthors who wish to add dignity to a particular perspective\nby elaborating on its longevity. They look for well-respected\nantecedents in order to claim that these forefathers, back then\nless exact and less clearly, had basically the same ideas that\none’s own research sheds new light upon now. Alfred Hettner’s\nrendition of Ritter’s and Richthofen’s concepts is a\nperfect example of this strategy (Hettner, 1898, 1927). Here,\nthese authors appear to be forerunners of Hettner’s own concept\nof geography, turning it into the ultimate fulfilment of\nwhat the founding fathers presumably intended (see Wardenga,\n1995). Another fine example is the works of Richard\nHartshorne (1939, 1958), who interpreted Hettner’s concept\nin light of the landscape geography of the interwar years (see\nHarvey and Wardenga, 2006), or the textbooks by Dickinson\nmentioned earlier. This type of historical narrative is meant\nto stabilise the subject’s identity and implement his or her\ntheories by referring to accepted authorities. To put it less\nrespectfully, authors lend from other people’s reputation in\norder to not have to rely on their own. Traditional narratives\nwere thus employed on an international level to underline the\nsignificance and reputation of geography by presenting it as\na stronghold of continuous scientific progress in knowledge\ngeneration.\nThe second type is the “exemplary narrative”. This is the\npreferred mode when it is dawning on the representatives\nof a mainstream approach that their method is about to go\ndown in history itself. They react to that threat by searching\nsets of basic and abstract rules in the historic field of\ntheir respective approach. They want to thereby prove the\nlasting productivity of their approach as well as its enduring\nvalidity, irrespective of ongoing methodological changes.\nMany papers in the German-speaking countries on the controversy\nover regional studies (Länderkunde) and landscape\nstudies (Landschaftskunde) use this type of narrative. The\nbest-known is Eugen Wirth’s much-quoted essay “Zwölf\nThesen zur aktuellen Problematik der Länderkunde” (Twelve\nTheses on Current Problems in Regional Geography), his\nreaction to students’ criticism at the German Geographers’\nNational Meeting (Geographentag) at Kiel in 1969 (Wirth,\n1970). While Wirth did not deny the need for reform, he insisted\non the validity of traditional Länderkunde methods,\nlike field observation, mapping, interviews and other sources.\nFor him, these implicit rules of research guaranteed results\nthat were “true” knowledge. He thus advocated the expertise\nof trained regional geographers. “Journalism-style snap-\nshots”, Wirth argued, could not replace the old Länderkunde\nand its aim of critically informed expert creation of relevant\nsocietal knowledge.\nExemplary narration is also frequently used by physical\ngeographers who write about “integrative projects” in geography.\nIn a renewed debate on chances and limits of inte-\ngrated research, exemplary narratives strive to tell us that traditional\ngeography is the most competent discipline for re-\nsearching relations between man and the environment. They\nthus hope to reduce the gap that has been growing between\nhuman and physical geography since the 1970s (cf.\nEhlers and Leser, 2002; Leser, 2003; Ehlers, 2005). Margarita\nBowen (1981) takes the same line by analysing rules of\nempirical research from Bacon to Humboldt – to ultimately\ndraw fresh ideas for environmental research inspired by authorities\nlike Humboldt.\nLast but not least there is a third type, the “critical narrative”.\nIn the anglophone world of geography, this type came\nto the fore in the 1970s, with classic antecedents like Fred\nK. Schaefer’s epoch-making “Exceptionalism in Geography”\n(1953). Critical narratives bring forth stories on geography\naiming at the deconstruction of accepted notions of continuity.\nThus, what is narrated is mostly anti-stories, and the\nnarrators are often young scientists at the beginning of their\nGeogr. Helv., 68, 27–35, 2013 www.geogr-helv.net/68/27/2013/\n', 'U. Wardenga: Writing the history of geography 31\ncareers. These are strongly influenced by the experience – an\nexperience that can also be used to further a career – that existing\npatterns of interpretation do not grant orientation for\nthe present and the future anymore. As I see it, critical narrative\nis employed within international geography mostly in\norder to support new perspectives on an old field of research,\nor to put forward new fields of research. Thus, critical narrative\naims mainly at convincingly conveying the capability to\nchange norms. In my opinion, there is no need to elaborate\non examples of critical narrative; suffice it to mention the\nkey words “New Regional Geography” (e.g. Wood, 1996),\n“New Cultural Geography” (Cosgrove, 1985; Cosgrove and\nJackson, 1987; Duncan, 1980; Philo, 1991; Mitchell, 1995;\nGebhardt et al., 2003; Natter and Wardenga, 2003), “Critic\nGeopolitics” (Wolkersdorfer, 2001; for a critical perspective\nsee Redepenning, 2006) or “Critical Cartography” (Harley,\n1989; Crampton, 2001; Crampton and Krygier, 2005; Dodge\net al., 2011:2–7; an overall review in Edney, 2012).\nThis type of narrative, much more pronouncedly than the\nones I mentioned first, has the potential to be turned into a\nweapon when a scientific community, ignorant of its history,\nis fixated on the latest “turns” and trends of the trade – to enforce\nthe validity of their own approaches. The authors who\ntell this type of narrative often claim high moral standards,\nthus blurring the boundaries of history of science and politics\nof science. A good example for this way of writing his-\ntory is the “Map Reader” edited by Dodge et al. (2011). In his\ncomprehensive review, Matthew H. Edney rightly criticised\ntheir selective choice of readings as “uncritical understanding\nof cartographical history” (Edney, 2012:66), “historical\ndistortion” and “mistreatment” of texts (67), all of which ultimately\nperpetuate “long established disciplinary ideologies”\n(67).\n4 Emerging horizons of future research: histories of\ntransfers and connectedness\nAs I said in my little outline of the history of writing the history\nof the “sexiest subject of all”, by the 1990s at the latest,\nhistorians of geography had caught up with the scholarly debates\naround them. We know where we stand now. Yet where\ndo we want to go from here?\nOver the last years, traditional boundaries of scholarly disciplines\nand national schools have eroded and become ques-\ntionable. Internationalisation of academia, but also the emergence\nof new fields of study – global studies, urban studies,\ndevelopment studies, to name just a few – have greatly influenced\nthe way we organise research today. Any cutting-edge\nhistoriography must accommodate these developments. We\ncan no longer base our research on a taken-for-granted nation\nstate as space of reference, as by doing so we risk explaining\nthe history of “our” geography mostly based on national\ndevelopments, ignoring factors beyond national boundaries.\nAttempts at bridging the transnational gap in an internationalised\nhistoriography of geography – as documented in the\nvolumes of the IGU commission – are not sufficient anymore.\nIt is rather imperative to analyse transnational exchange processes.\nThe emerging Global History with its focus on transna-\ntional exchange (e.g. Middell and Naumann, 2010) has\npointed out and discussed deficits in historiography. Especially\ncomparative approaches have been subject to\nscrutiny. These reflections resulted in theoretically informed\napproaches such as transferts culturels by Michel Espagne\n(2002), “entangled history” by Sebastian Conrad et\nal. (2002) or histoire croisée, developed by Michael Werner\nand Bénédicte Zimmermann (2002, 2006).\nI would like to share some findings of an ongoing GermanFrench\nproject, initially funded by DAAD and Égide, and\nsupported with travel grants by the German-French University.\nIn this project, a joint research group of the Leibniz In-\nstitute for Regional Geography and French CNRS-Equipe\nE.H.GO UMR 8504 has analysed the exchange processes\nbetween German and French geography in the 19th and\n20th centuries. We had a closer look at mutual references\nin theory, methodology and practical research, making use\nof Werner and Zimmermann’s concept of histoire croisée\n(Werner and Zimmermann, 2006). This concept is special\nbecause, borrowing from science studies, it stresses the reflexive\ncharacter of research and tries to stimulate scrutiny of\nour own subliminal concepts by methodological means in a\ntransnational research framework.\nIn the context of histoire croisée, there are three methodological\naspects that are crucial for a successful comparative\nanalysis (according to Werner and Zimmermann, 2006):\n1. The dangers of an external observer: transnational comparison\noften follows the patterns of cognitive observa-\ntion, usually based on differences and similarities. The\nmain methodological danger with this is to implicitly\nadopt the viewpoint of an external observer and thus\ncompare the objects of interest from an outsider’s perspective.\nAs our perception is shaped by socialisation,\nlearnt experience and implicit knowledge, it often unnoticeably\ninfluences the research process. Especially\nwhen doing transnational research we must keep this in\nmind if we want to escape the dangers of self-referential\nloops and related prejudices.\n2. Contexts, complex variety and multi-perspectivity:\ntransnational comparison and trans-disciplinary practice\nare often based on (re)constructing external con-\ntexts. Usually we project our own experience and world\nview onto experiences and world views of others. It is\ntherefore crucial to analyse the contexts of the agents in\nquestion very carefully. The complex variety and multiperspectivity\nthus emerging within the research process\ncan pose serious methodological problems, especially\nas we tend to create coherent and rigorous historical narrations.\nwww.geogr-helv.net/68/27/2013/ Geogr. Helv., 68, 27–35, 2013\n', '32 U. Wardenga: Writing the history of geography\n3. Dangers of Reification: yet another problem of comparative\nstudies is that the items compared are often\nthought of as static entities. Consequently all transnational\nendeavours run the risk of being designed within\nthe reference space of the nation state. This might\nlead to the teleological idea of diffusion as a threestep\nprocess of introduction, transmission and recep-\ntion. Even more important is what Werner and Zimmermann\n(2006:38) stated on comparison: “Entities and ob-\njects of research are not merely considered in relation to\none another, but also through one another, in terms of relationships,\ninteractions, and circulation. The active and\ndynamic principle of the intersection is fundamental in\ncontrast to the static framework of a comparative approach\nthat tends to immobilize objects”.\nIn view of these assumptions, one fact becomes clear: this\nway of doing research is rather slow and meticulous. As such,\nit is likely to collide with neoliberal ideas of making scholarly\nresearch marketable and more readily available. Yet –\nand this I can say with reasonable certainty – it really pays\noff in the end. It makes us aware of our own position and disposition\nin the research process and thus lets us understand\nto what enormous degree (national) taken-for-granted stereotypes\nand structures shape our historiography.\nWhat have we learnt so far? I would like to highlight three\naspects in order to illustrate the methodological caveats outlined\nabove.\nFirst and foremost, we realised that writing the history\nof a discipline, when done in the customary national categories,\ntends to consider its own settings as absolute, sim-\nply because they are the normal condition. It is what we\nknow, have grown up with, have been taught by our teachers.\nThis concerns what we research into, how we research\nand even who we research with. In our project we came\nto understand that this “insider perspective” can lead to severe\nmisinterpretations – regarding the history of the “for-\neign” geography on the one side, but much more regarding\nthe history of one’s own geography on the other side. So,\nfor example, when we analysed the concept of Landschaft,\nwe did not succeed in fitting it into a set of abstract criteria\nthat would enable a sound (transnational) comparison. It\nwas simply charged with too much implicit (national) knowledge\nthat we had not been aware of (see Hallair, 2010). This\nparadoxical phenomenon is caused by blind spots that prevail\neven in the most differentiated types of historical narratives.\nIn our project, German historians of geography learnt to see\nthings through the eyes of their French colleagues, realising,\ne.g., how massively the federal set-up of the German nation\nstate has shaped the structure of German geography. So the\npermanent competition of universities and geographical institutions\nof the various Länder (federal states) led to a ca-\ncophonous mass of methodological texts, duly analysed by\nHans-Dietrich Schultz (1980) in what still makes an excellent\nread today.\nWe have also learnt to keep an eye on shifting contexts.\nTake Friedrich Ratzel (1844–1904) who, during his lifetime,\nwas an outsider to German geography. His colleagues, with\ntheir minds fixed on geomorphology, found his bulky books\nso hard to read that they had to break them down in lengthy\nreviews. Yet in France, Ratzel was deemed the most important\nscholar of the German regional and human geography\ntradition. At our binational project meetings, our colleague\nMarie-Claire Robic explained us how Ratzel then turned,\nslowly but surely, from a scholarly hero into an anti-figure\nwhen French geography made him an adversary of the ever\nmore estimated Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845–1918). In\nGermany, on the contrary, it needed several rounds of reinterpretation\nto bring Ratzel back on the agenda for good,\nnot least inspired by French géographie humaine.\nThirdly, our research group learnt that, even when\nanalysing knowledge transfer processes, the danger of reification\nis always imminent. When we studied the develop-\nment of 19th-century geomorphology as a German-French\nhistoire croisée, we realised that this cannot be understood\nwithout the English-speaking discussion in geology and geomorphology\nat that time. The Harvard geomorphologist\nWilliam Morris Davis (1850–1934) and his “Cycle of Erosion”\ntheory played an eminent role in the emerging in-\nternational geographic debate after 1900. This remarkably\ntransnational process of knowledge exchange before World\nWar I was not only an example of mutual recognition of academic\nwritings. It actually occurred in direct contact when\nDavis travelled Europe and joint field trips of European and\nAmerican geographers traversed various parts of the globe\ntogether. In social and scholarly contact and by debating his\ncycle theory, a complex variety of international exchange\nprocesses evolved, creating interactions that even overlapped\nwithin a single national frame.\nConsequently, along paradigms of studying and explaining\nlandscape that differed in the various scholarly and national\ncultures, distinct transnational structures of geomorphology\nresearch emerged, which shaped the discipline well into the\n20th century.\nBased on the reflections of histoire croisée, the examples\nI briefly sketched hint at the fact that the changes inflicted\nupon us by the present age cannot be adequately described\nanymore with the three types of narratives outlined above.\nRather, we need what Rüsen (1987:92–94) termed “genetical\nnarratives”. This type of narration tells stories “in which the\nalteration of forms of life is necessary for their permanence”.\nThe “forces of change” are thus represented as “factors of\nsteadiness”. Genetical narratives moreover “organise human\nself-understanding as a temporally dynamic process: time\ngains the sense of temporality” and “form identity by mediating\npermanence and change to a process of self-definition\n(in German this is called ‘Bildung’)”. And Bildung – which\nin German can mean both creation and learning – means being\nready to learn, having a critical perspective on the self,\nGeogr. Helv., 68, 27–35, 2013 www.geogr-helv.net/68/27/2013/\n', 'U. Wardenga: Writing the history of geography 33\nself-aware and self-reflective – always conscious of the fact\nthat all knowledge is temporary and tentative.\n5 Conclusion: what we have learnt and where to\ngo next\nWhen I outlined the history of writing the history of geography,\nI identified four distinct stages of development. The\nearliest sprung from the practice of writing obituaries and eulogies\nand was based on biographical narratives. With clear\nnational reference, it recollected the history of the discipline\nas a history of “great men”. When geography became more\nand more international in the 1970s, this practice met with increasing\ncriticism, especially when the sociology of science\ncame to the fore. The changing relation between geography\nand society and the social construction of space became important\nsubject matters, too.\nThe great variety of subjects and the fluctuation of\nscholars involved did not give rise to national schools or\nstyles of writing the history of geography. Nevertheless\nwe can distinguish various transnational types of historical\nnarratives: traditional, exemplary and critical. They all react\nto the challenges of change that our present age imposes\nupon us. By narration, they try to cope with a type of change\nthat often feels like crisis. They create a great variety of\nhistorical imaginaries that might even contradict each other,\nand none of which could claim to be “true”, “right” or\nthe only possible interpretation. Since the 1970s, critical\nnarratives have become the preferred mode of writing the\nhistory of geography, which deserves special attention. They\nseem to be – on the one hand – a reaction to the “turns” and\ntrends that have come to replace each other in increasingly\naccelerated cycles. Thus in human geography it seems\nnecessary to create anti-stories that make room for new and\ninnovative developments within the scope of a rising theoretical\nand methodological cosmopolitanisation. On the other\nhand, critical narratives make the limits of historiography\nof scholarly disciplines more and more permeable towards\nthe politics of the discipline, because this way of producing\nhistorical narratives tends to turn its interpretation into a\nweapon to enforce concepts and ideas currently in vogue.\nThus historiography tacitly turns into a practice of power:\nthe past is colonised by a present perspective. Yet for the\nfuture we need concepts that enable us to critically reflect\nupon the act of narrating history. Concepts that enable us,\nwhen we draw a methodologically controlled comparison\nin our research, to avoid both the problems of an external\nobserver and the dangers of reification. This means, firstly, a\nclose scrutiny of historical contexts. It also means learning\nto deal with complex variety and multi-perspectivity. And\nit means letting go of the methodological nationalism\nthat historians of geography have cultivated for so long.\nInstead, we should rather analyse the transnational and\ntranscontinental transfers of ideas and concepts. When the\nideas that later turned into this essay were first presented at\nFribourg, Benedikt Korf, who had the kindness to read them\nin lieu of the absentee author, commented very much to the\npoint: “When we manage to go beyond national frames of\nhistorical narration, and by noticing the social construction\nof boundaries between so-called ‘national traditions’, we\ncan only start to make such boundaries permeable. We can\ntry to make them connecting rather than separating, not\nonly in research about the history of geography, but in all\nnarrations that mobilise histories of the subject in their\neveryday practices of making academic geographies”. This\nholds true now even more than ever.\nTranslated by Jutta Faehndrich\nEdited by: B. Korf\nReviewed by: two anonymous referees\nReferences\nArmstrong, P. H. and Martin, G.
