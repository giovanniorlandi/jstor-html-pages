If, A LESSON IN riNANCE, The fact that the sympathy of Amer, loana, following the financial interests, of the country aud largely on account, of that, ts given to Japan in her war, with Rusaia should teach a lesson in fl, nance*, and upset some of the dogma of, those who are unwilling to make tariff, concessions in the in teres of a greater, 1Kb., Vor Instance, the balance of trade, (so called) is against the United States, In the eommerce between this country, and Japan and all the countries over, which Japan has an influence. We im, port more goods from Japan, China ami, Korea than we sell them, while we ex, port more to Russia and Russian prov, inces than we import from them., However, in spite of this condition,, the business interests of the United, Staisi inatincUvely recognue that their, country would sustain a loss should we, Mcritice a Japanese trade with the bal, ance against us for a Russian trado, with the balance in our favor., Of course, to a thinking man the, cause* behind this are plain. It is the, volume of trade and not the balance, which makes the trade valuable. The, Seattle merchant can trade with Japan, because (he ships plying the broad, boeom of the Pacific carry cargoes both, ways, and the Seattle merchant is not, only an exporter, but an importer. He, makes a profit on the goods that are, ?hipped to Japan and on the goods that, ?re received from that country In do, ing so he makes a wider market for the, wheat farmer and he puts in the hands, of the same farmer silks, teas and rice, cheaper than be could otherwise get it., I* it not about time the same trade, policy that causes Americans to sympa, thise with Japan were applied to our, trade with Canada and other countries;*, If it la the volume of trade that makes, the profit, would it not be well to in, crease the volume of trade elsewhere, as well as in the Orient? Is it not time, that a common sense business policy, waa adopted?, Let us have reciprocity in large, doees., Rum:* will not b? represented at the, world\'* fair, and the quarter of a mill, Ion or more that was appropriated for, that purpose will be devoted tothe Red, Cross Society just to show that the gov, ernment does not need the money., However. Japan has asked for addition, al space at St. Louis to cover that made, vaeam by the withdrawal of Russia., May wheat has gone up to 41.0? a, bushel, and this prompts th>\' Seattle, Times to remark, "Who wouldn\'t be a, farmer?", Who ever heard of a farmer having \', May wheat?
