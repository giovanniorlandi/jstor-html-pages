Contributor Political\nand Economic Articles to Lending Periodicals\nand a Writor of Recognized Authority on the\nNational Government\'s Business Methods\nCopyright. Western Newspaper Union\nXXTT.\nWE’RE COLD TO REFORMS\nWe liuve not hail In our time u Presi\ndent who was u business man or who\nbud close acquaintance with business\nmethods. The Chief Wxecut Ives have,\nfor llie most part, not been executives\nus thut term Is now understood. Any\nthing hut. They regarded the govern\nmental machine us one regards a hired\nmotor car—a piece of mechanism In\nwhich to get somewhere, and with no\nIhought of Its power-transmission\nsystem or economy of operation.\nMr. Tuft did sense the fact thut he\nwas at the lieud of an organization\nwhose activities are almost as varied\nHr. Harding, I believe, shares this\nfeeling.\nAs Mr. Tuft pointed out, tills greut\norganization has never been studied\nlu delull as one piece of administra\ntive mechanism. No comprehensive\neffort lilts been made, until very re\ncently, to list Its many activities or to\ngroup them in such a way us to pre\nsent a clear picture of what Ihe gov\nernment Is doing. No satisfactory\nstatement has ever been published of\nthe linanclnl transactions of the gov\nernment us u whole. With large In\nterests at stake congress and the ex\necutive have never hud all the infor\nmation which should be currently\navailable if the most Intelligent direc\ntion Is to be given to the dully national\nbusiness.\nCongress, the President and the ad\nministrative officers have been at\ntempting lo discharge their duties\nwithout full Information as to the\nagencies through which the work of\nthe government Is being performed.\nIn the past, services, agencies, bureaus,\nwhat not, have been created one by\none as exigencies have seemed to de\nmand, with little or no reference to\nany scheme of organization of the gov\nernmeut-us a whole.\nMr. Taft pointed out all this and\nmade an earnest effort to change It.\nWith what result? Why, Just exactly\nnone. Congress was cold. The pub\nlic—meaning you and me—was colder.\nWe didn’t take any Interest In the\nproject, and therefore congress po\nlitely yawned It away Into Jlie tall\ngrass and out of sight. Mr. Taft was\ngiven enough money to employ an effi\nciency and economy commission and\nto moke Inquiry “Into the methods of\ntransacting the public business of the\nexecutive departments and other gov\nernment establishments."\nThe Inquiry was made aud the\nchanges recommended, hut nothing\nhas ever been done about It. This\neconomy and efficiency commission was\nvery conservative and cautious. It\ntook Mr. Taft\'s view that the prob\nlem of good administration Is not one\n(hat can be solved at one time. It Is\nn continuously present one. This\ncommission, made up of excellent men,\nsuggested that the reveuue-cutter serv\nice be abolished and Its activities be\ntaken over by other services. It was\nestimated that by so doing a saving\nof not less than $1,000,000 could be\nmade.\nAnother report recommended that\nthe lighthouse and life-saving services\nbe administered by a single bureau In\nstead of ns at that time, by two bu\nreaus located lu different departments.\nIt wus estimated that tills consolida\ntion would result lu a saving of not\nless than $100,000 yearly.\nThe abolition of the returns office of\nthe Interior department was recom\nmended, at an estimated direct saving\nof about $25,000 a fear, in addition\nto a large Indirect economy in the\nreduction of work to be performed In\nthe several offices.\nThe consolidation of the six auditing\noffices of the treasury and the Inclu\nsion lu the uudlting system of the\nseven naval officers who audited cus\ntoms nceounts at the principal ports\nwas uraed. The chance was exnected\nto produce an Immediate saving of at\nleast $135,000 yearly.\nFrom this modest start other changes\nand reforms and savings were to be\nmade.\nBut we weren’t interested In the\nhigh cost of government or the high\ncost of living eleven years ago. Mr.\nTaft didn\'t get a rise out of us. He\ndidn’t have much of a pull with con\ngress, either, poor man, and all his In\nquiry went for nothing ns far as any\naction was concerned.\nHe and his commission did bring out\nand establish, however, certain facts\nand conditions. It was a trustworthy\nand competent Investigation as far as\nit went. That Is something to the\ngood.\nThere Is a patent disposition In con\ngress now to take the whole problem\nof the routine administrative processes\nof the government under consideration\nand see how best to Improve them.\nWhether anything really worth while\nwill come out of It will depend en\ntirely on the degree of Interest you\ndisplay. If you will take the trouble\nto show that you know that the na\ntional business Is mismanaged and\nI costs too much, and that you are tired\n! of It, there will be action. ,\nHow Your Hootch is Made.\n| This editorial is primarily for the\nbenefit of the man who drinks moon\nshine liquor. Others who are not\nthus engaged in poisoning their bod\nies will find it of interest.\nThe most inveterate hootch hound\nfn Mississippi, if he could hut see\nhow the stuff he drinks is made,\nwould swear off forester.\nHardly a drop of the moonshine\nwhiskey being sold in Jackson came\nfrom a place that bore any resemb\nlance to sanitary surroundings.\nOn the contrary, the average\nmoonshine still is a place of inde\nscribable dirt, filth and squalor.\nIf you could but behold one of\nthese places, and examine the con\ntainers from which your beloved\n“white lightning’’ t* drawn, it\nwould make you vomit up your toe\nnails.\nThe Daily News has, with the\npermission of Prohibition Directoi\nM. H. Daily, examined some or the\nwritten reports submitted to the\nFederal government by prohibition\nenforcement officers describing the\nstills they have raided during the\npast few weeks.\nAt one place not far distant from\nJackson the officers found a dead\nbhtcksnake, about six feet long,\nbadly decomposed, in a barrel ol\nmash from which the liquid had been\ndrawn.\nAt another still where the barrel\nof sour mash was buried in ti e\nground a decayed bullfrog was found,\nfloating on top.\nBarrels of mash have been found\nin open water closets, devoid of\nsewerage, that were lilthy and filled\nwith flies.\nAt a still of large capacity the\ncap of the still was so filthy that it\nhad been fly-blown and infested\nwith maggots. The plant was in\noperation, and the “white light\ning” was being filtered through\nthe maggots.\nIt should be borne in mind that\npractically all the stills raided by\nprohibition officials are found in the\nopen, generally in some low, dirty\nswamp, where all kinds of insects\nand flies have easy access.\nThe average moonshiner has no\ntime to think of sanitation. He is\nchiefly concerned with getting his\nmiserable brew made and marketed\nas soon as possible.\nThe scene around the average\nstill would turn the stomach of a\ndead mule. The ground is nasty\nand sloppy, covered with old peach\nstones, potash, concentrated lye\ncans, regurgitated chewing tobacco,\ndirty flasks, carboys, fruit jars, old\nbarrels—anything and everything\nthat will hold liquor, regardless of\nhow it may have been originally\nused, and never even given a casual\nwashing before the hastily mauu\ntured liquor is placed therein.\nEvery bit of it is made amid foul\nness inconceivable and the concoc\ntions that are brewed are such as\nonly a copper-lined stomach could\nstand.\nUp in Director Daily’s office you\n11 i:_ _.\ntaken from stills which showed, or\nchemical analysis, thatconcentratec\nlye was used in the clarifying pro\ncess.\nYou would no more put concen\n(rated lye in your stomach, if yoi\nknew it, than you would deliberate!}\nswallow a dose of prussic acid, yel\nthe use of concentrated lye in tb*\nmaking of moonshine liquor is e\ncommon practice.\n\\ou will also see concoctions ol\nbrownish hue, others a dirty yellow\nred, opaque and viscid, of every de\ngree of rankness in smell and taste\nThese liquors are manufacturer\nby men who are ignorant of the firs\nelement of the laws of fermentatior\nor the rules of sanitation. Ti e}\nconcoct the deadly stuff by m i it\nstrength and awkwardness, so tr\nspeak, the sole and only aim bein|\nto evolve something with a power\ntul kick in it, and they give never i\nthought to bow dangerous or poia\nonous it may be.\nThe picture is not overdrawn\nGo down to the Federal courtroon\nat any term time and look at th<\nmoonshiners lined up for aentenci\nThu very sight of those pleadini\nguilty or convicted of making liquor\nought to be enough to discourage\nany sane human being from drink\ning the stuff they manufacture.\nYou wouldn’t let one of them come\ninto your home unless he had first\nbeen given a carbolic acid ball).\nAnd when you slop to think that\nyou have not only been insulting\nyour stomach and ruining vour\nhealth with their vile brew, but that\nyou have been paying exorb !tai t\nprices for it, and sneaking through\ndark alleys to make the ] ur ;hase,\nyou will feel heartily ashamed of\nyourself.\nMr. Hootch Hound, when you\nhave a few minutes of leisure time\nsome day, drop in at Director Dai\nly’s office and ask him to let you\ntake a look at his collection of\ndeadly samples. It will be far bet.\nter for you than any temperance\nsermon that was ever preached, and\nif it don’t cure you of the habit then\nyou are indeed beyond all hope o\nredemption.—Jackson Daily News.\nTishomingo Miss\nSunday a nice rain fell, the firsl\nin this section for some tune.

The\nsand that is being drawn out of the\nwall is saturated with it and some\noil has been c\'r iwn up. At present\nthere are several hundred feet of\nwnter on top of the oil, but a swab\nhas been ordered and will likely be\nreceived today and in all probability\nt will only he a question of a few\ndays until it is known as to the\nquantity of oil.
