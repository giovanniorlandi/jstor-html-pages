Several years back they re\n1 ceived definite assurances that a smelter\nwould be built. Months ago tlm Mason\nValley Mines Company began laying\nplans to build a smelter at Wabuska,\nbut, as is usual in such large enterprises,\nthere have been many unforseen delays\nand today actual construction work at\nthe smelter site lias not been com\nmenced\nAnd it is these delays — necessary\nthough tliev be that “maketh sivk tiie\n; heart" of the man who is waiting.\nBut—take it from us—actual construe*\nI lion yvork on the smelter at Wabuska\nwill soon begin and there will be few de\nlays until it is reaitv to receive ore.\nWhy not? The money to build it is\nraised and actually in band—yve have\nthe best of assurances on that point—\nthere is plenty of ore of a commercial\ngrade in the Yerington district to keep\nit busy for years to come, and a railroad\nfrom the mines to the smelter\nCan you beat that combination?\nWhy. a combination like that will un\nlock a bank safe any time.\nAnd it is not only the ores of tile Yer\nington district that can and will be\ntreated. The smelter—which y\\ ill treat\ncustom ores—is so located geographic\nally that it yvill naturally lie fed from\none of the biggest undeveloped ore\nzones in the country, bulling, Mina,\nVirginia City, Silver Citv, Bodie, Au\nrora. Buckskin, and other camps to\nsav nothing of Goldfield and Tonopah—\ncan have their ores treated at the Mason\nValley Mines Company smelter at Wa\nbuska.\nBut, as said before, there is enough\ni ore of commercial grade developed in\nthe Yerington district alone to keep it\nbusy for years\nor blocked out ready (or economical\nstuping, enough ore aliove the No. 4\ntunnel in the Mason Valiev mine—\nowned by the same people who are\nbuilding the smelter—to furnish the\nlatter 5(H) tons a dav for at least eight\nrears. And this ore is of a grade that\nwill pay handsomely, even at the pres\n, ent low price of copper.\nThere is no doubt about the state\nments in the above paragraph. It is\nnot a matter of guesswork, hope or\nsurmise. It has been figured out to a\nmathematical certainty, before the Ma\nson Valley Mines people decided to\n, lmild the smelter they had the ore re\nserves carefully sampled and measured\nup. The process of treatment was de\ncided upon alter exhaustive tests and\nthe cost approximately determined. The\n1 cost of mining and development was\n; figured out and the cost of transporting\n, the ore on the railroad to Wahuska is\ndefinitely known.\nSo, again we repeat, there is no guess\nwork about the Mason Valiev mine and\n\' smelter paying handsomely.\nIt is true the experts\' figures—on\nwhich it was decided to build the smel\nter—have been modified, but only where\nore reserves have been added to, costs\nreduced and profits increased.\nFor instance, the experts figured on a\ncertain tonnage of a certain average\n\' grade of ore above tile lowest level in\nthe mine at the time tliev examined it.\nTheir figures were correct as far as\ncould he demonstrated then, but the\npitch and rake of the ore shoots are\nvet v erratic, and in opening up the\nstopes. Superintendent Welsh has dent\nonstrated that there are thousands upon\nthousands ot ions mote ore in the upper\nI workings than the experts figured on.\nI As an illustration: On tlie third level\n•i crosscut was run into a good ore shoot.\nAt regular intervals beyond, other cross\ncuts were run in the same direction, but\nno ore of a commercial grade was found.\nNaturally it was figured that the ore\nshoot extended only a short distance\nbeyond the first crosscut, and that no\npay ore was above that level in that part\n! of the mine. Hut in opening up a stope [\n: at the first crosscut it was found that !\nthe ore shoot was "wavy" at this point, j\nand actually extended over and beyond 1\nthe last crosscuts, the latter being under !\nthe ore body but a few feet. In this\none stope there are thousands of tons j\nof ore more than the experts included\nin their figures—and the grade of ore j\naverages much better than where first i\nopened.\nThe cost of mining in the Mason Val\niev mine will not exceed one dollar per ]\nton—that means the complete cost of1\nmining, including development work\nIt will do a milling man\'s heart good to j\ngo through the mine and see the way j\nJack Welsh has figured out the economi\ncal sloping of tiie ore. Parenthetically. I\nit mav be remarked that low wages plav\nno part in this economy—good wages i\nare paid to good men and good work\nsecured\nThere is scarcely a stick of timber\nused in the slopes a mining man will I\nquickly realize what a saving in cost\nthat means. Then again, in stoping. ‘\nabout the same amount of ore is left in !\nthe stope as is taken out. This all tends i\nto economy and leaves a big reserve of\nore broken down, ready to shoot into\nthe cars almost at a moment\'s notice.\nHere is another thing that will listen\ng<x>d The ore at the lowest workings is\nthe best in the Mason Valley mines.\nOne stope there is as g<xxl as any other\nstope that can he found anywhere in\n| any other copper mine. Do you get\nthat? It sounds pretty big, but you can\nbet a ginger cooky it is pretty near true.\nIn tunnel No. 4—about 500 feet from\nthe surface the mineral zone is alxvut\n300 feet wide and diamond drills will\nthoroughly prospect the ore bodies below\nwith the object of determining just\nwhere the main working shaft will be\n! sunk. Everything will he so arranged\nthat this shaft will he sunk and the\n\\ lower ore hollies opened up without in\n1 any way interfering with the production\nI of ore from the upper levels.\nThe writer hasn\'t saida word in this i\narticle about one ore shoot l(Ki feet long\nj and 15 feet wide that will average 17 1\nper cent copper. He hasn\'t said a word\nabout chunks of practically pure copper I\n! that have been found in the mine. He\nhasn\'t mentioned these things because\n| they are exceptionally rich, and the\nman in charge is so averse to having tile\n“hull” peddled about the mine that he\nwould probably refuse him permission\nto again go ill the mine if he laid too\nI much stress upon the richest ore\nHut the writer will say that the Mason\nValley mine is a great big one—and the\nI smelter at Wabuska will be treating its\nj ore within a year.\nCase Appealed.\n1*. Dominici lus appealed to the dis- I\ntrict court the case which was recenth\ndecided against him in the justice court\nat Mason. Frank l.ucas sued Dominici\ntor sJT.s damages for allowing a ditch to i\noverflow "n the former\'s pasture and\nwas given a judgment of >1 and costs.\nFine Copper Prospect.\n1 have a fine copper prospect put up\nto me to sell at the price of a pn sped.\nA crackerjack minim; man tells me it is\nthe best prospect he he has looked at\nin years. And best of all the owner is\nnot asking a mine price, better look\nj into this.
