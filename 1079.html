        <pre>['Lagi in Standard Malaysian Malay\nIts meaning conceptualization\n[馬來語 Lagi 之語意概念]\nSiaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\nNational Chengchi University [國立政治大學]\nLagi, a less studied Malay adverb, has meanings such as ‘in addition’, ‘again’,\n‘more’, and ‘yet/still’. We aimed to see how these meanings could be related\nin a single word and to find the conceptualization and grammatical paths\ninvolved. We also intended to find out whether this word carries any underlying\nmeanings not specified in dictionaries. In the corpus, although many\nexamples have lagi in the sentence-final position, some unconventional sentence-initial\nuses were also found in news headlines. We found that lagi\nserves a special function in news headlines, emphasizing the repeatedness of\nevents that were often negative or undesirable. The seemingly unrelated\nmeanings of lagi can be categorized based on three meaning concepts –\naddition/more meaning, less-more continuum, and temporal lagi (‘yet/\nstill’, ‘again’). In addition to these concepts, we also found several possible\ngrammaticalization paths that contribute to the different uses of lagi.\nKeywords: Lagi, Standard Malaysian Malay, adverb, corpus\n關鍵詞：lagi、馬來語、副詞、語料庫\n1. Introduction\nLagi is an adverb that has been given little attention in Malay. Here, Malay refers\nto Standard Malaysian Malay. Only few studies that mentioned lagi were found.\nUnlike Malay verbs that have received much attention from many researchers\n(e.g., Hopper 1983, Cumming 1991, Benjamin 1993, Soh & Nomoto 2011, Soh 2013,\nSew 2016, and many others), adverbs do not have their own section in grammar\nbooks and are often discussed under the grammatical category kata keteran-\ngan. In an earlier version of the reference grammar book, Nik Safiah Karim et al.\n(1996: xiv) did not relate kata adverba ‘adverbials’ to kata keterangan, although in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1075/consl.00004.chu\nConcentric 45:1 (2019), pp. 82–111. issn 1810-7478 | e‑issn 2589-5230\n© Department of English, National Taiwan Normal University\n', 'a later version of Nik Safiah Karim et al. (2008) and in many other references,\nkata adverba became more common and accepted as part of kata keterangan (e.g.,\nSulaiman Masri, Mashudi Bahari, & Juliliyana Mohd Junid 2007, Rohaizah Ab.\nKarim 2014).1 Now, the website of Dewan Bahasa and Pustaka defines adverba\nas kata keterangan: “kata yg menjawab pertanyaan bagaimana, bila, di mana dan\nmenerangkan kata kerja, adjektif dll (spt dgn baik, dgn cepat, dahulu, sering); kata\nketerangan” [words that are used to answer questions such as ‘how’, ‘when’, ‘where’,\nand to modify verbs, adjectives, etc. (such as ‘well’, ‘quickly’, ‘before’, ‘often’)].2\nDespite the increasing recognition of kata adverba, lagi is still barely mentioned.\nIn Nik Safiah Karim et al.’s (1996) book, examples of it were scattered across several\nunrelated sections, often appearing in examples explaining other grammatical\nfunctions. Lagi in (1a–b) below is listed as kata keterangan in the book to explain\nthe change of first person pronouns in passive sentences. No further details could\nbe obtained about its uses.3\n(1) a. Makan-an\neat-an\nitu\nthat\nbelum\nneg (yet)\naku\n1sg\nrasa-i\ntaste-i\nlagi.\nlagi\n‘That food has not been tasted (by me) yet.’\nb. Makan-an\neat-an\nitu\nthat\nbelum\nneg (yet)\nku-rasa-i\n1sg-taste-i\nlagi.\nlagi\n‘I haven’t tasted that food yet.’4\n(Examples taken from Nik Safiah Karim et al. 1996:470; translation and\nglosses added by the current author)\nThe same scant information was found when we searched for past literature on\nlagi. In Goddard’s (2001, 2002) semantic primes in Bahasa Melayu, more (lagi) is\nlisted as an “intensifier and augmentor” together with very (sangat). This shows\nthat lagi is a basic concept, but it is unknown why it is scarcely studied. Rohaizah\nAb. Karim (2014) ran a corpus-based study on adverbials but did not list lagi\nas one of the adverbs to be observed. Fazal Mohamed Mohamed Sultan et al.\n(2010) discussed the “ungrammatical” transitive verb [memper + kan] followed\nby lagi but believed that this use was marked ungrammatical only as a “prescrip1.\nMalay names were cited in full names in both in-text citations and in the references.

There were authentic examples\nfrom “descriptive grammar” that showed the frequent use of [memper + kan lagi].\nThe discussion, however, focused on whether one should accept learners’ use of\n[memper + kan lagi] since there are many instances found outside textbooks. Yet\nsuch a discussion is not within the scope of this paper, our goal being to present\nthe uses of lagi and explain its conceptualization and discourse functions. Zaharani\nAhmad & Nor Hashimah Jalaluddin (2012) discussed lagi as an adjunct and\nits transformation in formal syntax. Franstišek Kratochvíl, Nur Izdihar Ismail, &\nDiyana Hamzah (2018: 71), on the other hand, dedicated a short paragraph discussing\nthe function of lagi as a ‘particle’ in the frog story – “lagi emphasizes the\nexistence of another referent which should be included in the focus.”5\nIn searching for uses of lagi, we found various seemingly unrelated meanings.\nWe postulated that these meanings could be conceptualized in a systematic way.\nWe thus ran a corpus-based analysis of lagi. In doing so, we also hypothesized that\nlagi carries a certain meaning that is not apparent at the word level. Our research\nquestions are as follows:\n(2) a. How can the seemingly unrelated meanings of lagi be conceptualized systematically?\nb. What underlying meanings are carried by lagi?\nIn what follows, we will explain some uses of lagi and relevant background\ninformation.\n2. Lagi\nLike adverbials in many languages, adverbials in Malay can be single-word\nadverbs or multiword adverbials. The single-word adverb lagi can be a bare word\nor it can have affixes, although the affixes often change the meanings and uses of\nlagi. For example, selagi means ‘as long as’ and ‘whilst’, and lagikan means ‘even’,\netc.6 As a multiword adverb, lagi can be combined with other words to become\ndifferent adverbs, namely, apa lagi ‘what’s more’, lagi pula ‘in addition’, lagi pun\n‘furthermore’, etc. (translations vary according to the sentences). From its uses\n5. When a co-authored work has both Malay and non-Malay names, for consistency of citation\n(see Footnote 1 for the convention of Malay author citation), all of the authors will be given their\nfull names in the in-text citations and in the references. Thus, Franstišek Kratochvíl is cited in\nfull name.\n6. The Kamus Dewan online provides bahkan ‘even’ and sedangkan ‘whereas’ as the translation\nof lagikan:\n84 Siaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\n', 'and various possible combinations, we understand why lagi is not included in any\nparticular section of grammar books – because it varies greatly in meanings and\nis used mostly as a connective when it appears in multiword forms. This diversity\nof meanings for lagi can create difficulties not only for machine translation but\nalso for human users. Therefore, to understand which meaning of lagi is intended,\none must rely completely on its context. In Traugott & Dasher’s (2002: 152) model,\nthe Invited Inferencing Theory of Semantic Change (IITSC) (cf. Traugott 1999),\nthey dedicate a chapter to the discussion of “adverbials with discourse marker\nfunction.” In that chapter, they claim that adverbials aim “to signal an aspect of\nthe speaker’s rhetorical stance toward what he or she is saying, or toward the\naddressee’s role in the discourse situation.” (Traugott & Dasher 2002: 152). They\nalso state that adverbials “mark the speaker’s view of the sequential relationship\nbetween units of discourse, that is, they serve as connectives between utterances.\nThey are widely known as ‘discourse markers’ (Fraser 1988) or ‘discourse connectives’\n(Blakemore 1987).” (Traugott & Dasher 2002: 152).\nLagi, also as a polysemous word,7 has all the features mentioned above – it signals\nthe rhetorical stance of the speaker and also marks the speaker’s view (e.g.,\ndia lagi cantik ‘s/he is more beautiful’). One example is shown in (3) below:\n(i) Serangga\ninsects\nyg\nrel\nkecil\nsmall\nitu\nthat\nlagi-kan\nlagi-kan\ndpt\nget\nmem-bina\nmem-build\nbukit\nmountain\ndgn\nwith\nmeng-angkut\nmeng-carry\npasir\nsand\nse-butir\nse-class\ndemi\nby\nse-butir.\nse-class\n‘Small insects can even build a mountain by carrying sand grain by grain.’\nhttp://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Cari1?keyword=lagikan (translation and glosses added by\nthe current author)\nHowever, the only example of lagikan in our corpus could be translated as ‘moreover’, ‘even’, or\n‘in fact’. We kept one translation (‘even’) only for this use:\n(ii) Mungkin\nmaybe\nbagi-nya,\nfor-adv.suffix\nhukum-an\npunish-an\nseperti\nlike\nitu\nthat\ndi-sifat-kan\npass-behavior-kan\n‘enteng’.\nlight\nLagi-kan\nlagi-kan\nsebelum\nbefore\nini\nthis\nhampir\nnear\n10\n10\ntahun\nyear\nbeliau\n3sg\nkeluar\nexit\nmasuk\nenter\npenjara.\njail\nJadi,\nso\napa-lah\nwhat-lah\nsangat\nmost\nsekadar\nsimply\npenjara\njail\ndan\nand\nse-kali\nse-time\nsebat-an.\nstroke-an\n‘Perhaps for him a punishment of that kind is nothing/not a big thing. Moreover he was\n/He was even/ In fact he was imprisoned for 10 years before. So what effect could a\nmere jail sentence and a one-time stroke have on him?’\n7. Traugott & Dasher’s (2002) model is based on semantic change. Therefore, the fact that a\nword is polysemous has a strong connection with its possibility of undergoing semantic change.\nWe will discuss this in a later section.\nLagi in Standard Malaysian Malay 85\n', '(3) Setelah\nafter\ndi-fikir\npass-think\nsemula,\nagain\npeluang\nopportunity\nke-emas-an\nke-gold-an\nseperti\nlike\nini\nthis\nbukan-nya\nneg-adv.suffix\nselalu\nalways\ndatang.\ncome\nSebagai\nas\nanak\nchild\nseni,\nart\nbila\nwhen\nlagi\nlagi\nsaya\n1sg\ndapat\nget\nmem-pamer-kan\nmem-showcase-kan\nkreativiti\ncreativity\nuntuk\nfor\nmeng-arah-kan\nmeng-direct-kan\nkarya\nart.work\nse-hebat\nse-great\nini?\nthis\n‘After contemplating once again, a golden opportunity like this is not always\ncoming. As a child of the arts, when else can I get to showcase [my] creativity\nto direct a work as great as this one?’\nAlthough lagi means ‘again’ or ‘else’ in (3), it expresses the speaker’s view on the\nissue that would not be demonstrated if lagi was removed. Without lagi, bila\n‘when’ would simply form a question that asks, “When can I showcase [my] creativity?”\n(Bila saya dapat mempamerkan kreativiti?).\nLagi also serves as a connective between utterances when lagi means apa lagi\n‘what’s more’, lagi pula ‘again’, etc. Although there were mentions of lagi in different\npieces of work, no systematic discussion has been carried out. This paper will discuss\nlagi’s semantic meanings as well as its conceptualization in Standard Malay.\nAs stated, there have been some mentions of lagi in the past, although many\nonly discussed lagi as part of something else. Koh (1990:283) did not discuss\nlagi in particular, but several examples were found such as lagipun ‘furthermore’,\nwhich was listed as part of the discussion of sentence coordinators. According to\nKoh (1990: 286), lagipun marks the semantic function of ‘addition’, following the\nsemantic classification adapted from Longacre (1985): “In ‘addition’[,] one state of\naffairs is presented as an addition to another. This relationship may be marked by\nlagipun ‘furthermore’” in the corpora used by the author. Koh’s example of colloquial\nMalay is in (4a) below (no translation was given in Koh’s work; translation\nis added in this paper), while (4b) was taken from our own corpus, in which lagi\nand pun are separated:\n(4) a.

Lagi pun means ‘there again’\nor ‘furthermore’ to resume a topic previously mentioned.\nIn another reference book by King (1986: 6; glosses added), lagi appears in the\nsection on comparisons, as shown in (5a–c) below:\n(5) a. Buku\nbook\nitu\nthat\nlagi\nlagi\nkecil.\nsmall\n‘That book is smaller.’\nb. (original: keréta)Kereta\ncar\nini\nthis\nlagi\nlagi\nbesar\nbig\n‘This car is bigger.’\nc.

Although this is a good topic to explore, it is not the aim of this paper to testify whether previous\ntopics existed before lagipun. An additional corpus-based research on pun may provide\nbetter insights into this proposition. We thank the reviewer for bringing this up.\nLagi in Standard Malaysian Malay 87\n', 'King’s (1986: 8) explanation is given below:\nThen, instead of saying, “This one is larger than the others”, we simply say, “This\none is larger”. The first sentence in Malay would be…yang ini lebih besar daripada\nyang lain, but the second would be…yang in lagi besar. That is to say that when\nthe comparison stops short after the adjective and does not continue with a than\nor daripada, the lebih must be changed to lagi in Malay.\nAlthough this rule seems to be written for learners, it illustrates how little people\nknow about lagi; for example, it can be used to replace lebih…daripada\n‘more…than’ when daripada is absent. In King’s (1986) book, there is nothing\nmore about lagi.\nBased on the definitions in the Kamus Dewan (Hajah Noresah Baharom\n2002: 744), lagi as an adverb in Malay has several meanings. Most of these meanings\nhave been mentioned before, namely, ‘in addition’, ‘again’, ‘more’, ‘as compar-\nison’, and ‘yet/still’. In (6a–f) below, we have combined the meanings from the\nKamus Dewan and the official website Dewan Bahasa and Pustaka9 (translation\nand glosses were added by the current author):\n(6) a. tambahan kepada yang sedia ada\n‘adding more to the existing’\ni.

One native speaker recommended that amok could also be used as the English translation\nfor the Malay amok/amuk, because amok has entered the English dictionary.\n(https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amok)\nLagi in Standard Malaysian Malay 89\n', 'Among these uses, Sneddon et al. (2012:205–206) mentioned its use as a temporal\nmarker: “Lagi and tengah [‘in the middle’] can replace sedang [progress-\ning marker], although they are less frequent and not used by all speakers,” as in\n(7) below. This is true because this use is not found in Malaysian Malay. Cumming\n(1991:69) also listed lagi as a progressive marker, together with sedang (lagi\nsedang), but this use is also not found in Malaysian Malay.11\n(7) Mereka\n3pl\nlagi\nlagi\nmakan.\neat\n(Sneddon et al. 2012:205–206)‘They are eating.’12\nRafferty, Burns & Argazali-Thomas (2014: 146) provided some grammar exercises\non lagi in their section on temporal markers; for example, “tidak lagi (the negation\nof masih [still])” shows “an event of state is no longer in effect” (e.g., Jam 1:00 siang\nRatih tidak di Imogiri lagi. ‘At 1 p.m., Ratih is no longer in Imogiri.’). The uses\nof lagi with negative markers are common in Indonesian and Malaysian Malay.\nSneddon et al. (2012:212) stated that “[t]he combination of a negative and lagi\nmeans ‘no longer, not any more’. For speakers from some regions, the combination\nof belum and lagi means ‘not yet’,” as shown in (8b). The use of the negative tidak\nwith lagi can be seen in (8c) below:\n(8) a. Dia\n3sg\nbukan\nneg\nguru\nteacher\nlagi.\nlagi\n‘She’s no longer a teacher.’\nb. Saya\n1sg\nbelum\nneg(yet)\nlapar\nhungry\nlagi.\nlagi\n(Sneddon et al. 2012:212)‘I’m not hungry yet.’\n11. Sneddon et al. (2012:209–210) also stated the following: “[S]udah can precede tidak and\nbukan“ and “the combination indicate[s] that what follows is no longer the case.” Lagi is also\nseen in the examples below:\n(i) Kerana\nbecause\nasap\nsmoke\nmenara\ntower\npeng-(k)endali\npeng-control\nsudah\nalready\ntidak\nneg\nter-lihat\nter-seen\nlagi.\nlagi\n‘Because of the smoke the control tower could no longer be seen.’\n(ii) Dia\n3sg\nsudah\nalready\nbukan\nneg\npem-bantu\npem-help\nlagi.\nlagi\n‘She is no longer a servant.’\n12. All examples from Sneddon et al. (2012) were originally in boldface. The boldface was\nremoved except for lagi. The glosses were also added by the current author. The English free\ntranslation was originally given in the book.\n90 Siaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\n', 'c.

Among the languages cited, German mehr\n‘more’ (when negated) means ‘no longer’ (van Baar 1997:96), and other languages\nsuch as Arawak sabo ‘be additional’, ‘be superior’ and Vietnamese nūa ‘be additional’,\n‘be superior’ (van Baar 1997:96) have meanings that lagi also has – ‘more’\nand ‘in addition to’ (lagi may have a superior reading if one considers someone\nhaving more of one quality than others).\nSince lagi has all these features, it is likely to have undergone the same grammaticalization\npath: lagi can be used in comparative sentences (i.e., Suzi lagi can-\ntik. ‘Suzi is more beautiful.’); lagi is often used with the negators belum ‘not yet’,\nbukan ‘not’, and tidak ‘not’, two examples of which are given in (8a) and (8b).\nWhen lagi is negated by belum/bukan/tidak, it means ‘something expected has yet\nto happen’, as shown in (8b), or ‘is no longer happening’, as can be seen in (8a) and\nin the last line in (8c). This shows that “to be a teacher”, “to be hungry”, and “to be\nstill reading” are expected. In other words, somehow lagi also relays the expectations\nof a speaker.\nSince lagi also has an iterative meaning, the sentence in (9a) below could\nmean kembali ‘to repeat an action’ or ‘again’. Here, it means ‘the child is crying\nagain’ or ‘the child is back in crying mode’. The meaning in (9b), also appeared in\n(6dii), in which the person’s arrival is expected because s/he used to come based\non past experience.\n(9) a.

Methodology\nIn this study, we ran a reanalysis of lagi. Before we looked at corpus examples, we\nfirst explored the occurrences of lagi in Malay idioms (pepatah and peribahasa).\nMalay idioms often appear in parallel constructions and, as such, lagi is frequently\nused for comparisons. When lagi appears, it often draws similarities between two\nconcepts. We selected idioms containing lagi from the Malay idiom dictionary\nKamus Peribahasa (Mohd Tajuddin Abd Rahman 2006). There were altogether 24\nidioms containing lagi, among which two idioms were repeated with slight differences\nand were counted once only.\nRegarding the corpus data, we investigated the actual uses of lagi in news articles.\nWe used a corpus containing news articles from Utusan Malaysia, a national\nMalaysian newspaper, from December 16, 2010, to June 14, 2011. This corpus has a\ntotal of 35,767 news articles and lagi appeared 24,756 times. Since we found uses of\nlagi in several positions of a sentence, we also calculated their positions in all the\nsentences. We found that 282 (1.14%) instances of lagi appeared in the sentenceinitial\nposition, within which 71 instances were news headlines; 2,537 (10.25%)\nappeared before a comma; and 1,537 (6.21%) appeared in the sentence-final position.\nThe remaining majority of instances appeared within a sentence.\nWe then searched for the patterns of lagi in the corpus, from combinations of\ntwo to three words in sequence. We searched for any verbs that appeared on the\nleft or right of lagi. In return, we collected a list of verbs that could be grouped\nas either [verb + lagi] or [lagi + verb] and sometimes both (i.e., the same verb\nappeared before and after lagi). From this list of verbs, only six lexical verbs were\nfound among the top 100 collocates, or the neighboring words that co-appeared\nwith our keyword lagi. The six verbs were – meningkatkan ‘to raise’, cedera ‘to\ninjure’, menambahkan ‘to add’, menjadi ‘to become’, memantapkan ‘to strengthen/\nempower’, and mengukuhkan ‘to strengthen’.\nIn the last part of the analysis, we found that lagi serves a special function\nin news headlines. The uses of lagi in news headlines will be discussed, and the\nspecial role of lagi in news headlines will also be highlighted. Finally, the semantic\nrelations of the different meanings of lagi and its conceptualization will be\ndiscussed.\n92 Siaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\n', '4. Results\nThe use of lagi in idioms will be discussed first, and then in the corpus in terms of\nits collocations and news headlines.\n4.1 Lagi in idioms\nThe occurrence of lagi in each idiom was grouped under the same meaning, as\nshown in Table 1 below (additional explanations were obtained from Sapinah Said\n(2004) and Abdullah Hassan & Ainon Mohamad (2011)):13\nOf the 22 idioms (two were conflated), most carried the meaning ‘more’\nwhilst several carried the meanings ‘else’, ‘still’, and ‘yet’. Lagi, when negated,\nmeans ‘(not) anymore’. In the idioms, parallelism was found in the use of lagi,\nsuch as lagi murah lagi ditawar ‘the more I reduce [the price], the more he bargains!’,\nespecially in the ‘more’ category.14 The uses of lagi in the idioms mostly\nfollowed nouns or adjectives, rather than verbs. The contexts were mostly negative,\nwith unfavorable situations; they often pointed out worse situations com-\npared to better ones. Most of the idioms used natural phenomena (e.g., hujan\n‘rain’, sawah ‘paddy field’) or essential things in life (e.g., garam ‘salt’, api ‘fire’, ubi\n‘yam’) as parables to illustrate a moral principle or attitude. The next section will\npresent the corpus examples.\n4.2 Lagi in the corpus\nLagi in two-word combinations did not return any meaningful results (lagi dengan\n‘lagi with’, lagi untuk ‘lagi for’), and therefore will not be discussed. The meanings\nof lagi only materialized in three-word combinations. In (10a–j) below, some\nexamples and the meanings of lagi in three-word combinations are shown:\n(10) a. tidak\nneg\nlama\nlong\nlagi\nlagi\n‘not much longer’\nb. lebih-lebih\nmore-red\nlagi\nlagi\n‘furthermore’\n13.

In the news headlines,\nlagi was usually followed by an event, usually an existing one (i.e., [Lagi +\n98 Siaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\n', 'existing event]), as shown in (14a–g) below. In these sentences, lagi could mean\n‘again’ or ‘another/one more’, referring to the addition of another incident to the\nmany already existing. For each of these examples, we checked the news content\nto find out the correct translation of these headlines. The context is given in\nparentheses.\n(14) a.

It can be seen\nLagi in Standard Malaysian Malay 99\n', '(Traugott 1995, Ramat & Ricca 1998: 248)\nthat most uses of lagi above formed independent constituents in these examples.\nAlthough the use of lagi expressed the repeatedness of the incident, it was added\ndeliberately to the initial position in the headlines to emphasize that this was not\na single event but, rather, it had happened before. For instance, in (14d), instead\nof saying “Trash again on the Roadside” the placement of lagi in the first position\nproduced a reading of “Again! Trash on the Roadside!” It is worth noting that lagi\nwas not used in a conventional way in these sentences. All the examples above\nshow that an incident or event, often a repeated one, was mentioned after lagi. The\ndiscourse function of lagi can be related to the functions of adverbs as mentioned\nin Traugott & Dasher (2002: 153):\nNot all languages use adverbs; fewer yet use them polysemously…but if they do,\nthere is an overwhelming tendency for them to develop from clause-internal or\n‘predicate adverbs’ to sentential adverbs, and ultimately to discourse makers or\n‘connective adverbs’.\nIn most of these uses, lagi means ‘more’ and ‘again’ in the structure [lagi +\nexisting event]. The placement of lagi in the sentence-initial position emphasizes\nthe “repetitiveness” of the event rather than the event itself. In addition, most of\nthe time the repeated events were negative or undesirable. Thus, one of the major\nfindings of this study is that the reoccurrence of events increased the impact of the\nissues mentioned in the news articles.\nAbraham’s (1991: 332) study on modal particles claimed that “[t]here is a limited\nnumber of lexemes in German each of which is ambiguous with respect to\ngrammatical category.” Abraham’s list includes adverbs and “sentential connectors”\nsuch as aber ‘but’, schon ‘already’, “scalar particles” such as nur ‘only, auch\n‘also’, and many others. Abraham (1991: 373) found that these modal particles “exist\nside by side” with the “non-particle and non-modal use” of the same terms and\ndisplay “systematic bleaching of the semantic content” following the “unidirectional\ncline”, as shown below:\nlocalistic > temporal > logical > illocutive/discourse functional\nAlthough we did not investigate diachronic data and lagi does not have a localistic\nuse (defined as “locality, or topology” [Abraham 1991: 373]), lagi displays tem-\nporal and logical (defined as “communicative anaphor in the sense of causal\nconfirmation with respect to what had been uttered just before develops” [Abraham\n1991: 365]) as well as illocutive/discourse functional meaning change.15\n15. Traugott & Dasher (2002: 154) bracketed localistic and temporal and claimed that these\ntwo stages are optional. Further discussion of grammaticalization paths can also be found in\nTraugott (1989) and Traugott & König (1991).\n100 Siaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\n', 'In other words, lagi behaves rather similarly to some of the modal particles mentioned\nin Abraham’s (1991) study.\n5. Conceptualization of Lagi\nBased on what we found, we will summarize the uses of lagi in this section. After\nwe went through the meanings of lagi, we postulated that there were three meaning\nconcepts of lagi: addition/more meaning, less-more continuum, and tem-\nporal lagi (‘not yet’, ‘again’). These concepts are shown in Figure 1 below:\nFigure 1. Conceptualization of the meanings of lagi\nFigure (1a) shows the addition/more meaning. In this meaning, lagi is used to\nindicate ‘in addition to the existing condition’. This meaning can be used literally\nwith the addition of numbers (as in “five more people were hospitalized”) and\nmetaphorically to mean ‘not only…but also’. The less or more concept is shown\nmore completely in Figure (1b). The addition meaning is closely related to the\nless-more continuum, represented by expressions or idioms that mean ‘the more\nthe better’.\nLagi in Standard Malaysian Malay 101\n', 'The meanings ‘yet/still’ and ‘again’ of lagi are explained in Figure (1c), which\nshows the temporal lagi. Sneddon et al. (2012:211–212) suggested that lagi with\nthe meaning of kembali ‘return’ “has the meaning ‘return to [a] former state’,” as\nin Example (9a) Anak itu menangis lagi. ‘That child is crying again.’. In Figure (1c),\nwe displayed these two meanings as part of a circle instead of a straight line\nbecause lagi without negation has a ‘repeat’ meaning. We considered that the\nnegation of lagi (belum/tidak/bukan lagi) meaning ‘not yet’ or ‘no longer’ was part\nof the movement from point A to point B, which was not completed, but the\n‘again’ meaning moved from point A to point B and then back to point A again,\nand therefore was repeated.\nFrom the above, one can see how these unrelated meanings can be linked.\nThe conceptualization of lagi helps explain how some seemingly random meanings\nof lagi are related. In terms of the grammaticalization of these uses, we found\nseveral useful paths from the list provided by Heine & Kuteva (2004), as discussed\nbelow, in terms of their matching of meaning concepts of lagi. Heine &\nKuteva’s (2004: 15) concepts are “semantic-functional, rather than morphological\nor syntactic, categories.”\n5.1 iterative > still\n“In the case of the iterative the action is repeated on the same occasion” (Heine &\nKuteva 2004: 183). In (15) below, the example from (6dii) is repeated:\n(15) Agak-nya\nguess-adv.suffix\nia\n3sg.gen\nakan\nwill\ndatang\ncome\nlagi\nlagi\nhari\nday\nini.\nthis\n‘Guess s/he is coming again today.’16\nTherefore, iterative could mean that the same action is repeated on the same\noccasion. From many of the headlines we mentioned earlier, as in (16) below,\nrepeated from (14d), one can also see the iterativeness of the action (someone\nthrew trash on the roadside):\n(16) Lagi\nlagi\nsampah\ntrash\ndi\nloc\nbahu\nshoulder\njalan\nroad\n‘Again, trash on sidewalk’\n16. This example is similar to the example given in (Heine & Kuteva 2004: 184) for iterative >\nstill for Tayo CF (Kihm 1995:239):\n(i) Ta\nthou\nfini\ncpl\nvja\ncome\njer,\nyesterday\nta\nthou\nvja\ncome\nakor\nagain\ndema.\ntomorrow\n‘You came yesterday; you’ll come again tomorrow.’\n102 Siaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\n', 'The evidence above shows that lagi has an iterative reading. iterative also\nhas a connection with still: “[I]t would seem that the still-meaning arises\nwhen, instead of a repetition, the situation implies a duration that is longer than\nexpected” (Heine & Kuteva 2004:90). There are also uses of ‘still’ for lagi. In (17)\nbelow, lagi has a possible meaning of ‘still’:\n(17) Ada\nexist\norang\npeople\nkata\nsay\nkalau\nif\nper-kahwin-an\nper-marry-an\nkita\n1pl\ndari\nfrom\nawal\nearly\nlagi\nlagi\ntidak\nneg\ndi-per-setuju-i\npass-per-agree-i\noleh\nby\nmertua,\nin.laws\nmaka\nthen\nsampai\nuntil\nke\nloc\nmati\ndeath\npun\npun\nkita\n1pl\ntidak\nneg\nakan\nwill\ndi-suka-i-nya.\npass-like-i-3sg.gen\n‘Some people say that if our marriage is not agreed/blessed by our in-laws\nfrom the beginning (literally, since early still), then until death they will not\nlike us (literally, we will not be liked by them).’\nExample (17) could be a temporal meaning of still but this meaning is disappearing\nfor the phrase dari awal lagi is almost lexicalized.17 The ‘on-going’ meaning of\nlagi is perhaps that in (18) below. Example (18) means that the husband has not\nreturned yet.\n(18) Dalam\nin\nkes\ncase\npertama,\nfirst\nse-orang\nse-class\nisteri\nwife\nke-dua\nke-two\nmen-(t)untut\nmen-claim\nfasakh\nannulment\nsetelah\nafter\nsuami\nhusband\nkeluar\nexit\ndari\nfrom\nrumah\nhouse\ndan\nand\ntidak\nneg\npulang\nreturn\nlagi\nlagi\nselepas\nafter\nitu.\nthat\n‘In the first case, a second wife claimed annulment after her husband left and\ndid not return anymore after that.’\n5.2 return (‘to return’, ‘to go back (to)’) > iterative (Heine & Kuteva\n2004:259–260)\nFor return, it is the kembali meaning that was previously shown in the example\nfrom Sneddon et al. (2012: 211–212) – Anak itu menangis lagi. ‘That child is crying\n17. The combination of dari awal lagi and the still meaning of masih lagi deserve further\ninvestigation.\nNamun\nhowever\nbegitu,\nso\nke-lihat-an\nke-look-an\njuga\nalso\nbeberapa\nseveral\npe-serta\npe-follow(participant)\nyang\nrel\nmasih\nstill\nlagi\nlagi\ndi-lihat\npass-look\nse-olah-olah\nse-if-red\nhilang\nlost\narah…\ndirection\n‘Nevertheless, it was seen that several contestants were still looking seemingly/apparently lost…’\nLagi in Standard Malaysian Malay 103\n', 'again.’ – which means that the child is returning “to a former state.” In (19a), saya\ntidak sanggup melakukannya lagi… ‘I am not able to do it anymore…’ means\nthat the speaker had done something before, but he was unable to do the same\nthing again. This example has both return and iterative meanings. When it\nmeans return, it shows that the speaker was unable to return to what he had\ndone previously. When it is the iterative meaning, it means that the speaker was\nunable to repeat what he had done before. If lagi was removed, saya tidak sanggup\nmelakukannya would lose both the return and iterative meanings. In (19b),\nthe understanding is that the “husband” returned to the status of “married,” but\nit is more common to say that the “husband” married again (thus, iterative).

For durative, we tested the use of lagi with the prefix\nber- in (20b) and with an adjective in (20c). In (20b), lagi marks the fact that\nAbang Jamal was sad before the moment of speaking, although we could not tell\nwhether his sadness was continuous or on-and-off (iterative). Without lagi, the\ndurative meaning is less obvious. In (20c), rasa malu lagi means that the speaker\nwas still feeling embarrassed at the moment of speaking. If lagi was removed in\n(20c), the durative meaning would be removed too – rasa malu adalah kerana…\n‘feel embarrassed because…’.\n(20) a.

We\ndid not find many that carried only one of the concepts.\n5.4 comparative (+ negation) > no longer\nThis path was discussed in Section 2.

However, there are some missing links. For instance,\nwe did not find a path that linked iterative (+ negation) > no longer, which\nmakes perfect sense because ceasing a repeated activity is to say that it no longer\nhappens. Yet, from the above, we found a better explanation of the different\n106 Siaw-Fong Chung [鍾曉芳]\n', 'meanings of lagi and built a clearer connection between meanings that previously\nseemed unrelated.\n6. Conclusion\nOur corpus investigation and research on meaning conceptualization provide a\nre-analysis of lagi, an adverb that is often ignored. In dictionaries and in grammar\nbooks, lagi has never been the focus of discussion. The main reason is that its\nmeanings are too diverse and to generalize all its meanings is difficult. Our study\nshed light on this by providing better connections between the various uses of lagi.\nWe also postulated possible meaning changes that might affect the various uses of\nlagi, including its ‘addition’, ‘comparative’, ‘temporal’, and discourse functions. We\nshowed the possible conceptualizations involved with the meanings of lagi and the\nrelationships between the different meanings.\nLagi, with a dominant ‘iterative’ meaning, can be negated to mean something\nexpected has yet to happen. To find uses of lagi, we examined idioms and a corpus\nof news articles to relate its different meanings using grammatical paths observed\nin other languages. One of our major findings is that lagi has pragmatic functions\nthat emphasize the non-singularity of an event, especially when it appears in\nnewspaper headlines. The unconventional use of lagi at the beginning of headlines\nemphasizes the repetitiveness of an event.\nThe possible grammaticalization paths that have been discussed in this paper\ncan be compared to other languages and may thus contribute to typological studies\nin the future. From a pedagogical perspective, some idiomatic expressions with\nlagi could be introduced to learners at the beginning level, especially the ones with\nthe dominant ‘iterative’ meanings (e.g., jumpa lagi ‘see you again’ (goodbye) and\nsekali lagi ‘once more’). These commonly used expressions are also very practical\nin daily conversations.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the reviewers and the Editors-in-Chief for their detailed comments\nand suggestions on the previous version of this work.
