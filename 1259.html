Banks, one of the moet\ndistinguished educators of the state,\ndied Monday morning at his home\nin Bryan. Col. Banks was well\nknown in Waxahachie, having: at\nonetime served in the official ca\npacity as president of Marvin Col\nlege. A press dispatch gives the\nfollowing short biographical sketch\n, of Col. Banks :\nCol. Banks was a native of Vir\nginia and a graduate of Washing\nton and Lee University. His life\nwas spent in educational work, in\nwhich hf was eminently successful\n\'in Virginia, North Carolina, Arkan\nsas and Texas. Upon the organiza\ntion of the Agricultural and Me\nchanical college in 1878 he was elec\nted to the chair of languages a: d\ncame to Texas to accept the posi\ntion, remaining until 1880. He after\nward taught at Waxahachie and\nSalado. He came to Bryan in 1884\nand was superintendent of the city\nschools for ten years, resigning in\nlffi*4 to accept a luisition in the A. A\nM. college, in which he did his first\nand last active work in Texas. He\nwas highly educated and master of\nfive foreign languages, Latin, Greek,\nGerman, French and Spanish. Me\nwas instrumental in organizing the\nState Teachers\' association and the\nCentral Teachers\' association.\nHe served throughout to civil war\nin the corps of engineers under Gen.\nWblling. He wai« the Col. Banks\nmentioned in some histories as the\nColonel of a Virginia regiment in\nthe celebrated raid on Harper\'s Fer\nry when John Brown was captured\nand killed.\nNegroes Identified.\nA few weeks ago four negroes\nwere arr«*»tpd near Ennis and\nbrought here and jailed and com\nplainte ot burglary filed against\nthem.

Τ\nIs It Your Child?\nEd. Light:—A word of warning\nto parents has been given, with lit\ntle heed, and I wish to add to it an\nother. Parents of this town are very\nlax with their children, as a rule,\nand this fact has been demonstrat\ned so flagrantly that it is a wonder\nit escapes the parental eye. I wish\nto call attention, especially, to the\ncharacter of conversation between\nthe boys and girls, and ask that the\nparents observe it carefully to sub\nstantiate the charge. The drift of\nconversation ataong a great portion\nof them is largely t\'m> famii.iak,\nOFTEN VJTUiAR AND INDECENT. If\nyou don\'t believe it ask any of the\nboys. If you don\'t approve of it,\nwhat are you going to do to stop it?\nIf you do approve it, you have no\nright to grumble when sorrow and\nshame overtakes your family. It\ndoesn\'t take the most intelligent\nmind to conceive the end. Not all\nare weak enough to fall, but it might\nbe vours among the exception.\nHn AMKKII, CONDUCT 18 Β KO M i NQ\nNOTORIOUS among the children here\nand It is time to call a halt. Its use\nless to enumerate the evils attend\ning as they are well known, and the\ntime to nij> future trouble in the bud\nis now—not wait until too late. The\neyes of the little ones are open to\nall the avenues and when the exam\nple is set, can anything less be ex\npected? When school children will\nplay hookey and spend school hours\nat the West End Park alone, what\nmay be expected? When girls are\npermitted to go driving with the\nboys until after midnight alone\nsomething is wrong. Is it your\nchild? Is it your sister? Is it your\nwife that allows this conduct? Is it\nyou and do you approve of it?\nParent.\nA Memento of Early Days.\nJoe Williams, the big planter who\nlives near Italy, was in the city yes\nterday ami brought with him the\nhead of a big buffalo, which is now\n011 exhibition at the Board of Trade\nsaloon. Mr. Williams says that he\nand some friends were seining for\nfish in Chambers creek some time\nsince and found this head in a deep\nhole of water. Judging from its\nsize this head must have been from\nan unusually large buffalo bull.\nThere is a bullet hole in the center\nof the skull, which shows that the I\nbeast must have been killed by an\nold time flint rifle.\nI\'ucle Bob Mayfleld is the only\nman living in Ellis county who ever\nsaw buffaloes roaming over her\nboundless praries. Mr. Williams\ncame here in liv>7, but he says these\nanimals migrated further westward.\nA Parson\'s Noble Act.\n"I want all the world to know,"\nwrites Rev. C. J.Budlotig, of Asn\nawav, U.

Their action\ncan well be emulated by cotton\nmills in other states, A committee\ncomposed of H. W. Fairbanks, E.\nA. Du Bo se and I). Ç. G hidings, Jr.,\nreported a resolution and agreement\nthat no child under 12 years of ape\nshould be allowed, under any cir\ncumstances, to work in the mills,\nand no child under 14 to labor at\nnight. Between the ages of 12 and\n34 they may labor in daytime (1,\nif they can read and write (2) if the\nchild has a widowed mother or par\nents physically incapacitated to\nsupport it.

His\npublished reasons are a difference\nof view with his state platform on\nthe tariff question. Speaker Hen\nderson standi* for the tariff as it is,\nand congressional control of trusts.\nHis party in Iowa declares for a\nrevision and reduction of the tariff\nto the end that the trusts may be\nchecked in their rapacity upon trie\npeople. Speaker Henderson thinks\nthis a concession to the democratic\nposition of placing trust made arti\ncles on the free list, and because of\nthis lack of harmony between him\nself and his party declines the nom\nination tendered him. Ex-Governor\nBoies is the democratic nominee,\nand the declination of Mr Hender\nson almost assures his election.\nAt the same time it accenuates the\nsplit ι in the republican party\nthroughout ilie middle west and\ngives bright hopes of a democratic\nhouse.\nThe Protracted Meeting.\nThe protracted meeting now in\nprogress at the Methodist church ie\nbeing well attended and iuterest in\nthe services seem to be on the in\ncrease.

Upchuroh, of south\nItaly, has for many years been\nhandling fine horses and jacks.\nSome time since he published a\nnotice in the Italy News-Herald,\nrequesting all who had colts from\nhie animals to bring them to Italy\nlast Saturday, and the notice resul\nted in about twenty-five or thirty\ncolts being mustered in a show ring.\n1 love to look at pretty ladies and\nnext to them a pretty horse fills my\nvisions best and I consider myself\nfortunate In having been on the\nground Saturday. Mr. Upehurch\nhas for many years given to the\nowner of the premium colts from\nfiis horse and jack the season fees,\nwhich amount to $13 or $20. Last\nSaturday Mr. I\'pchurch, selected\nMessrs. Fate Futch, R. L. Calvert\nand Ira Appling, three practical and\nsuccessful farmers of the Italy\ncountry, to act as judges and say\nwhose colts were entitled to the\npremiums. It was indeed a pretty\nsight when the judges ordered the\ncolts from Alex Sheppard, the mag\nnificent stallion of Mr. Upchurch, to\nbe led to one side apart from the\nmule colts. After a careful and\ncritical examination they tied the\nblue ribbon to the pretty colt of J.\nN. Pittman and the red ribbon was\nattached to the colt of Van (\'lark,\nshowing that it was second best.\nAlex Sheppard has sired some high\nand fast steppers in this and Hill\ncounty and each and every man on\nthe ground there with a colt was bet\nting ou raising a good animbl, and\nhis colts rarely ever fail to develop\ninto splendid aiul some of them are\nsure enough rae<· horses. After the\npremiums had been awarded to the\nhorse colts the mule colts from Mr.\nI\'pchurch\'s fine jack- were rounded\ninto one corner of the ring, and the\nfirst.premium was awarded to W.\nC. Jenkins for the best mule colt\nand the second premium was given\nto Hon. A. J. Loyd.\nFine stock are profitable to the\nfarmer who raises them and the far\nmers of Italy and surrounding coun\ntry are co-operating with Mr. I\'p\nchurch in this line, and that they\nmay succeed is the wish of\ni SNOCENCK.\nCured Hemorrhages of the Lungs\n"Several years since my lungs\nwere so badly affected that I had\nmany hemorrhages," writes A.
