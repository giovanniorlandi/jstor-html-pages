        <pre>['SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nVOL. XII. NO. 8\nPOLITICAL POT=PIE\nTo the "old-timer" in politics in King\ncounty it looks natural to see John Wood\nin<r lined up at a desk alon«- by the side of\nAl. Rurtherford, as can now be seen in that\nparticular office at the county court house,\nwhich is occupied by the county commis\nsioners. Within the past 15 years not many\ndays have passed but what either one or\nboth of these men could be seen occupyinjil\nofficial positions about the office of the coun\nty commissioners either as a member of the\nboard or as an employe thereof. It has been\nsix years now since Wooding has actually\nbeen employed at the court house, but the\nturn of the political wheel has once more\nbrought hm to the surface. After retiring\nfrom the office of county commissioner he\nEor two years filled the position of state sen\nator. He resigned that position to accept\nthe nomination for sheriff. For that office\nhe was beaten at the polls and temporarily\nletired from public life. He was a candi\ndate for a state appointment under Gover\nnor Mead, but left. lie was recently se\nlected by the county commissioners as tire\nwarden for Kin" 1 county, and to execute the\nduties incumbent on him in that capacity ex\nplains his having a desk in the county court\nhouse at present. Tin- "south district,"\nwith John Wooding as the leading political\nspirit, has had a long and successful run for\nits money, and has succeeded in domineering\nthe politics of the county for a great many\nyea rs.\n* * #\nSpeaking about the familiar face of Al.\nRutherford about the board of county com\nmissioners reminds the Pie-Maker that a\nfriend of Al. has announced that he (Al.)\nwould be a candidate for county commis\nsioner from the Third commissioners\' dis\ntrict, to succeed Peter J. Smith, the present\nincumbent. There will be a number of as\npirants for the same nomination, but in view\nof the afct that Al. Rutherford is politically\nhooked up with Pete Smith, John Wooding\nand the "south district" in general, the\nodds in his favor of winning the fight are\nthree to one. County Assessor John W.\nPeter is also a candidate for the place, but\nthe powers that be in the county are against\nhim, and he will have an up-hill pull of it.\nSince 1892 the men elected county commis\nsioner from the Third district are Al. Ruth\nerford, of the "south district" combine; W.\nH. Heaton, Democrat;\nDemo.-Pop.; P. J. Smith, of the "south dis\ntrict" combine, twice elected. It will thus\nbe observed that whenever the Republicans\nwon the district, it was done by forming a\ncombination with the "south district,"\nhence the chances of any one else winning\nthe district from that combine are very re\nmote. Rutherford made a good and efficient\ncounty commissioner when in office, and he\nhas given splendid satisfaction as purchas\ning agent for the county for the past four\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JULY 21. 190f>\nDEPUTY STATE FIRE WARDEN (KING COUNTY)\nHON.

Politically speaking, he has well\n\'fortified himself and he will be a hard man\nto beat, even in the absence of any country\ncombine.\n"In my opinion the next mayor of Seat\ntle has not as yet been mentioned," came\nfrom a group of well known politicians one\nday this week, while discussing the situation\nwith the Piemaker. Seattle demands a con\ntinuation of her present policy on the part\nof her next mayor. The citizens, having\ngotten a taste of a decent policy, will not he\nsatisfied with any other from now on. We\ndo not mean to intimate that the men who\nhave already been spoken of as candidates\nfor the nomination of mayor would do other\nthan what the present mayor is dCing, but\nsome of them will have a hard time convinc\ning the voters that they wll, hence they\nwill not only have much trouble getting the\nnomination, but would have equally as much\ntrouble getting the election should they hap\npen to be nominated by their partisan\nfriends. Seattle is having the cleanest ad\nministration at present that she has ever\nhad since she has been a city above the 40,\n--000 mark. There is absolutely no chance for\nthe "crook" to do any business with either\nthe mayor or the chief of police, and if any\nof the police officers get caught in dong any\n"funny busness," as many of them did do\nunder former Seattle administrations, they\nwill lose their official heads at once. It is\nsaid of Chief Delaney that he told a would\nbe prominent tenderloin politician, who had\ncome to the headquarters looking for police\nprotecton to conduct a gambling game: "If\n1 was certain you were running a game at\n# * #\nPRICE FIVE CENTS\npresent or had been running one, I would\nlock you up right now. You, nor no one\nelse, can yet any protection from me to\nbreak the law while I am chief of police of\nSeattle. You can do no business with me."\nDown in AValla Walla county the war be\ntween the Boxers and the men of the tribe\nof Levi is still jj\'oing merrily on, and in the\ncity election this week the Boxers scored a\nnotable victory, despite the efforts of the\nAukeny crowd to colonize the First ward\nwith penitentiary guards.—Colfax Com\nmoner.\n* # *\nIf the warden of the state penitentiary at\nWalla Walla and his assistants are found\nguilty of illegal registration in order to butt\ninto the local election, it will teach them "to\ntake a joke" and not meddle with some\nthing that is none of their business. It too\nfrequently happens that public officials take\nan active part where they have no business\nwhatever. Governor Mead is investigating\nthe matter, fully determined to inflict pnn\nsbment wherever he finds that wrong has\nbeen done. May he have the courage to fire\nthem, though they have escaped the law on\na technicality.—Exchange.\nA number of attorneys were considerate\nenough to send The Republican legal notices\nthis week, which falls under the head of\nnew business, for which we are very grate\nful. We trust others will do likewise and\nthus keep the hull polling, The Seattle Re\npublican has been published, without losing\na single issue, for twelve long years, and it\nshould be well enough established by this\ntime to be on a most substantial financial\nbasis, but it is not and the most of the read\ners of the paper know why it is not. The\neditor hereof has no desire to go into de\ntails over the matter at this time-—it is not,\nyou know why, that is sufficient. There is\nno reason or excuse for withholding patron\nage from a paper whose cardinal principles\nare for right and justice and good govern\nment, such as has The Seattle Republican\nadvocated since if was first established in\nthis cty. The efforts of man should be\npatronzed by his fellow men for the merit\nthat is in them, and not for the man himself.\nDo not declare, without- a thorough investi\ngation, that "nothing good can come out of\nNazareth." Do not further soliloquise,\nwhen you find that you are mistaken, that\nyou will not have it, however good it may\nbe, simply because a Xazarene produced it.\nThe Seattle Republican, more plainly speak\ning, truly needs your business assistance. It\nneeds a share of that which you have put\naway for printer\'s ink. It needs a share of\nthe public patronage that must be printed\nin a weekly newspaper of genera] circula\ntion. The Seattle Republican has the larg\nest and most varied circulation of any week\nly paper published in Seattle, and that\nTiieans the entire state, and it asks for a\nshare of your patronage. Can it get it.\'', 'MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.\nJohn E, Humphries says: "The people\nare mistaken in regard to the position of the\nmayor of Chicago on municipal ownership.\nThere has been no vote yet taken in Chicago\ndirectly upon the question. Under the act\nof the legislature of .May 18, 1903, of the\nState of Illinois, the people had a right to\nvote whether or not a certain law, passed by\nthe Legislature, should go into effect. Un\nder the peculiar constitution of Illinois,\nlocal laws may he passed by the legislature\nto take effect upon a majority vote of the\npeople. Under section 4of the act approved\nMay 18. 1903, it is provided thus: \'This act\nshall not be in force in this city until the\nquestion of its adoption in such city shall\nfirst have been submitted to the electors of\nsaid city, and approved by a majority of\nthose voting thereon.\'\n"Under the laws of the State of Illinois\nthe question was submitted as to whether or\nnot the law passed by the legislature should\ngo into force, and a majority of the citizens\nvoting approved the act, consequently the\nlaw is now in force.\n"Further it is provided in the law, section\n1. thus: \'But no city shall proceed to op\nerate street railways unless the proposition\nto opearte shall first have been submitted\nto the electors of said city, as a separate\nproposition, and approved by three-fifths\nof those voting thereon.\'\n"Up to this time, no vote has been taken\nupon the question as stated in the above\nproposition as to whether the city of Chi\ncago will or will not proceed to operate\nstreet railways; in other words, under the\nlaw. the city has no power to own. construct,\nacquire, purchase, maintain and operate\nstreet railways within its corporate limits,\nexcept upon the three-fifths vote, as above\nstated; consequently Mayor Dunne, in order\nto carry out his plans, as the council will not\nsubmit the matter to a vote of the people,\nhas recommended the forming of a corpora\nlion by a number of the responsible citizens\nof Chicago, and granting to them franchises\nwith the privilege of the city, at any time\nit has the power, to take up the franchises\nby paying to the citizens exactly what it\ncost them, and no more. That is the condi\ntion now in the city of Chicago.\n"The people are being misled by the news\npapers (uintentionally, of course), because\nthe newspapers have not examined the Illi\nnois Law, and no one has so far taken the\ntrouble to state the exact condition. Any\none can see the law for themselves by look\ning on pages 72, 7:5. 74. 75 and 76 of the\nlaws of Illinois relating to the incorporation\nof companies."\nThe editor of The Light Railway and\nTramway .journal, of London. England, has\nwritten the following letter, among things\nof which he states thus:\n"London, E. C, June 30, 1905.\n"John E. Humphries, Esq., 602 Mutual Life\nBuilding, Seattle. Washington, Q. S.

Under\nmunicipal ownership" and operation, and\nwith honest administration, kept free from\nparty politics, you should give your citizens\ncheap transport and at the same time make\nhandsome profits.\n"Throughout Great Britain municipal\ntramways are working with marked suc\ncess, and with the great advantage of hav\ning wiped out of existence the endless dis\nputes and troubles which existed under the\nold company system, and with the enormous\nadvantage of being masters of their own\nstreets. This result alone affords ample\njustification for municipal ownership, but\nthere are many other advantages, not the\nleast of which is the much greater comfort\nof traveling, and the knowledge by the peo\nple that they are traveling on their own\ncars and making profits for themselves.\nEvery man is interested in preserving order,\nin the cleanliness of the cars, in the good be\nhavior of the officials, and in the mainte\nnance of the best service for the whole of the\ncitizens. With your facilities for generat\ning electricity from water power, you can\nproduce current at most favorable prices.\n"You will find in every issue of our jour\nnal returns of the traffics of our municipal\ntramways, and the animal or half yearly\nresults of their working —out of some 130\nmunicipal undertakings there are only three\nor four which do not pay well, and these\nonly because of initial mistakes in laying\nout the lines, or overequipping them, and so\nhaving a lot of dead capital.\n"Our municipal tramways, it should be\nremembered, have to work under the strict\nest conditions; have to pay interest on the\nloans which form their capital, have to set\naside large specified sums yearly for sink\ning funds in repayment of the loans (which\nare all for fixed terms of years, varying\nfrom 6 years to 30 years for different parts\nof the equipment) ; they set aside large sums\nfor depreciation, in addition to keeping\neverything in first-class condition from rev\nenue: pay their men well, and then in most\ncases are enabled to hand over large sums\nin aid of the local rates.\nHON.

Hiunpries, on June 21, 1905.\nmailed the interview of Mr. Jacob Furth,\nwhich appeared in the Times, in regard to\nthe Vienna street car system bein»- about\nto be leased to private parties, to the editor\nof The Light Railway and Tramway Jour\nnal, of London, England; and on July 18,\n1905, he received an answer as follows:\n"London.

My let\nter of last week to you will have anticipated\nyour question, but I may add that it is\ntotally incorrect to say, as is said by Mr.\nFurth, that the municipality of Vienna has\nleased its tramway system. On the contrary,\nthe system, which is a very fine one, is\nworked by the municipality itself very\nprofitably, and is now being considerably\nextended. Yon will see by our report of\nthe Municipal Tramways Conference in Lon\ndon this week that an American engineer,\nfrom Boston, bore testimony to the fact that\nin very many respects British tramways\n(which are mostly municipal) are far ahead\nof American street railways in respect of\ntrack, cars, comfort and cheap fares.\n"Yours faithfully,\n"THE EDITOR."\nTt must be remembered that in Vienna\nthey have a 1-cent working-man\'s fare nights\nand mornings; •\nTHEEE ARE FOOLS AND FOOLS.\nIn its eolorphobia the South can furnish\nmore fools to the square iuch than any por\ntion of the world.

The excess of the European\npopulation will How out of the continent\nin the direction of least resistance. This\nleast resistance is offered by the colored\nraces, and these, therefore, are of necessity\ndoomed first of all to be dislodged by the\nsons of the white race and then to be an\nnihilated.\nThe feeling of mutual responsibility which\nis gradually being embraced by all Euro\npeans will not extend to the colored races.\nThat uniformity of civilization which makes\nthe peoples of Europe like to one another\nwill not subsist between these and the in\nhabitants of the remaining continents.\nThe application of force, which in Europe\nwill be prospectless, will guarantee an easy\nsuccess beyond its bounds. The European\nemigrant will not remove out of the tem\nperate zone, which is the most beneficial\nand agreeable to him, farther than may be\nabsolutely necessary, lie will first of all\nsettle the whole of North America and Aus\ntralia and the whole of Africa and America\nsouth of the Torrid zone. Then he will take\npossession of the southern coasts of the\nMediterranean sea and penetrate into the\nmore hospitable portions of Asia.\nThe natives will first of nil try to organize\nresistance, but will soon see that their, only\nsalvation is in flight. They will retreat be\nfore the Europeans and in their turn over\nwhelm the smaller and feebler landholders,\ntreating them in the same way as they them\nselves have been treated by the stronger\nwhites.\nEvery generation, however, will produce\nin Europe a fresh, superfluous swarm of hu\nman beings who will have to emigrate. The\nnew torrent will mount up beyond the high\nest water mark of the earlier stream, ami\nthe summits of European colonization will\npress farther and farther into foreign con\ntinents, always more and more approxi\nmating the equator.\nThe inferior races will soon completely\nperish.

WASHINGTON,\nYOU ARE PERFECTLY SAFE.\n(From Georgetown News.)\nA Negro author of Cleveland, Ohio, in an\naddress before the Boston Literary and His\ntorical Association, recommended misceg\nenation as a solution of the race problem.\nWhy will some educated Negroes persist in\nstriving for social equality through a mix\ning of the races? lie knows, if he knows\nanything, that there is one insurmountable\nbarrier to such a condition —that the white\nrace could not in an hundred thousand\nyears assimilate the black; that by intermar\nriage the result would be, eventually, a semi-\nAfrican race, in color at least. Common\nsense, morality and decency are opposed to\nsuch teachings. More harm is done to the\nadvancement of a strugglng, ambitious and\ndeserving class than can be overcome by\nyears of meritorious effort. We have no idea\nthat such a proposition will ever lie favor\nably considered by Belf-respecting members\nof either the white or black race. We pro\ntest against such mouthings, for the reason\nthat it is simply placing further obstacles\nin the way of the black man\'s progress by\nmembers of his own race.\nCalm yourself, old man. for an "Aunt\nDinah" that would take such "•trash" as\nyou off a Christmas tree with a watermelon\nthrown in would be hard to find. Let mis\ncegenation between the whites and the\nblacks of this country come as soon as it\nwill or may, you can rest easy, for none of\nthe blacks would ever condescend to hook\nup with you.\nFor forty years we have heard a great\ndeal about a war of races in the South. If\nthere is a war it will be a war against crime,\nimmorality and superstition.\nPeople must be patient with the Negro,\nWhen we study the trials of my race, I think\nthat the race deserves great credit. There\nis always something new for the Negro—one\nday he is going to die out, another he is go\ning to multiply and overrun the South, and\nanother all are to be banished to Africa.\nI speak as a Virginian and Southerner.\nThe principal question the white people of\nthe South ask is, "When is this education\ngoing to reach our kitchens\'?" I don\'t say\nthat all of our women should be cooks, but\nas nine-tenths of them are we want to edu\ncate them to be the best cooks. There is no\ndisgrace in being a cook, but there is eternal\ndisgrace in being a poor cook.\nI wish that we might return to the old\ndays when the Lees and other aristocratic\nfamilies went into the Negro Sunday schools\nwith their Bibles and tried to teach and help\nup. It is as much a duty as spending money\nand sending missionaries to China, Japan\nand other far-off countries.\nOne of the most pathetic things in the\nSouth is that the Southern people do not\nknow what is going on in the way of edu\ncating the Negro at their very door.\n••President."\nThe nasty murderous assault made on Po\nlice Officer Jacobs by the keepers of a low\nItalian dive in Belltown merits the extreme\npenalty of the law on those guilty of the\ndeed. Policemen are repeatedly assaulted\nby vicious characters in this city, but. be it\nsaid to the credit of the colored colony, no\npolice officer or any other kind of officer of\nthe law is ever wilfully attacked in their\nplaces of resort as was Officer .Jacobs last\nWednesday evening at Frank\'s Place, and\nyet police officers take special delight in\nabusing the Negro at all times and under all\ncircumstances. They never go on the wit\nness stand to testify against a colored pris\noner without speaking of the prisoner n\nthe most disrespectful terms. Not because\nthe officer lias any excuse or reason for so\ndoing, but simply because he has heard sonic\none else say, it is popular to say mean things\nagainst Negroes, Persons wilfully commit\nting such assaults on police officers should\nbe dealt with in such a manner that they\nnever again, if they lived to be as old as was\n.Methuselah, would attempt a similar offense.\nNEGRO NEEDS TEACHING.\n(By Booker T.

It is a 223-page volume, giving a con\ncise description and account of the institu\ntion and its work, and may be had by any\none on application. The new catalogue is\nconsiderably larger than any previous num\nber, and represents, in its increased size, the\nrapid growth of this splendid educational\ninstitution. The total net enrollment in all\ndepartments of the college during\' the year\nwhich closed on the 22d of June aggregated\n793 students, about 150 more than the num\nber enrolled last year. This is exclusive of\nJAPANESE PEACE ENVOY\nBaron Komura, the Japanese peace envoy.\non whom the eyes of the civilized world are\nturned, arrived in the Seattle port Thurs\nday and was received with shouts of ap\nplause by the thousands of Japanese sub\njects sojourning in this city and community.\nNot only by the Japanese, but likewise\nby the subjects of Uncle Sam, among whom\nare our best and leading citizens. Men, who\nstruggled to do homage to that distinguished\nJapanese have, perhaps used the most shock\ning language, and that, too, in the no very\ndistant past, about the inferiority of the\n"darker races" and the superiority of the\nwhite races, and that the proud Anglo-\nSaxon race (meaning all white-skin per\nsons) would never knuckle to a darker race.\nbut the Japanese-Russian war and its results\nhavV brought about a great change of heart\non the part of these "never-bend" whites,\nand now they declare the Japanese "mighty\nfine fellows," and are doing homage to the\nrepresentatives of the race like Chester\nfields. Of course, Jim Hill and his represen\ntatives in Seattle are making a great fuss\nover the little "big men" for mercenary\npurposes. Those fellows have not changed\ntheir ideas one iota about the inferiority\nof the darker races, only they, see an oppor\ntunity to do business with the Orient by\ntruckling to the Japanese, and they are too\nmuch "money mad" to let a single dollar\nget away, even though they are compelled\nto call things white what they have always\ninsisted were black.\nthe large number now in attendance at the\nsummer session for teachers.\nAlthough the State College is only four\nteen years old, it has now a faculty of sev\nenty officers of instruction and administra\ntion, and maintains department of instruc\ntion in mathematics and civil engineering,\nchemistry, botany and zoology, agriculture,\nEnglish Language and literature, economic\nscience and history, mechanical and elec\ntrical engineering, geology, domestic econ\nomy, and military science and tactics.

Bethel\nchurch has been established here for\nmany years and when reasonably pas\ntored gets the congregation. It is ru\nmored, however, that Rev. Freeman\nof this latter church, believing the\nconference will not return him to the\nwork, has rented the home of Brice\nTaylor and has moved a part of his\nfamily household effects therein\nand will move himself as soon\nas he is no longer its pastor.\nHe, it is said, will for a time locate\nand go into the newspaper business,\nhe having in view the incorporating\nof the Seattle Searchlight as a weekly\npublication.\nThe Baptist church has late\nly called a new pastor, who has\nalready arrived and is now holding a\nseries of meetings.

Bailey moves me to write this ar\nticle. Soon after he came to King\ncounty I made his acquaintance, and\nat once was attracted to him for his\napparent sterling qualities and his ex\ncellent judgment upon matters in gen\neral. I soon found that Judge Bailey\nwas not only posted on the current,\nevents of the day, but that he was a\ndeep thinker upon all subjects con\ncerning the welfare of the people. He\nwas as patriotic a man as I ever con\nversed with, and loved his country,\nfor the sake of the country and the\npeople; believing its population to be\nthe best on earth. I loved to talk\nwith him for his views were full of\ncommon sense and his conclusions, in\nmy opinion, were always correct.\nI had abundant opportunity to test\nthis for the space of three months.\nWe were chosen as jurors in the same\ncourt and served together for that\nspace of time. I well remember the\nfirst case which came before the jury.\nIt was a complicated affair, and the\njury was divided into several factions;\none after another was called upon by\nour foreman for an opinion, and the\nsubject of this article was the last\none called upon. His was the clearest\nexposition of the case of any and all\nothers, and after a short deliberation\nthey agreed that the colored man was\nright, and returned a verdict accord\ningly.

As remarkable as it may\nappear, during that whole three\nmonths there never was a verdict ren\ndered that was not in accordince with\nhis judgment, and after the second\ncase Judge Bailey\'s opinion was called\nfor first by the foreman. In the death\nof Gideon S. Bailey a good man has\nbeen removed. He cannot be recalled,\nbut- his many virtues will live to be\nfollowed by others. A. B.
