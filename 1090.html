Numerical\nexamples show that the proposed model has more flexibility to capture the implied volatility term structure and is suitable for\nempirical work in practice.\n1. Introduction\nOptions’ pricing has played an important issue in the general\ntheory of asset pricing since the celebrated work of Black and\nScholes [1] (called by BS model), who assume the asset\nreturns satisfying a Geometric Brownian motion with\nconstant parameters. However, option pricing formulas in\nthe BS model do not perform well empirically in practice\nbecause of the stylized facts, such as the asymmetric leptokurtic\nfeatures and the volatility smile. Due to the limi-\ntations of the BS model, there has been a wide range of\nresearch carried out to improve upon this model. (e BS\nmodel has been extended to incorporate either constant\nvolatility plus jumps or stochastic volatility with/without\njumps to capture these stylized facts. Merton [2] was the first\nto introduce a normal jump-diffusion model which can be\nconsistent with the extrememovements sometimes observed\nin financial time series and lead to the leptokurtic feature,\nvolatility smile, and closed-form solutions for options.\nHeston [3] employed the square-root process for modeling\nthe variance of the underlying asset upon the BS model and\nshowed how to use the Fourier transform to obtain the\nanalytical formula of vanilla options. Bates [4], Scott [5],\nZhang and Wang [6, 7], Deng [8], and Pillay and O’Hara [9]\ncombined Heston’s stochastic volatility model withMerton’s\nnormal jump-diffusion model to model the asset price dynamics\nand obtained the explicit formulas for European\noptions. Eraker et al. [10] and Chernov [11] investigated\nHeston’s stochastic volatility model incorporating jumps\nboth in returns and volatility. Duffie et al. [12] suggested a\ngeneralized affine jump-diffusion model (AJD), in which the\ndrift vector, covariance matrix, and jump intensities all have\naffine dependence on the state vector. Consequently, the\nAJD model has become a main topic for research studies on\nequity returns and on currencies, among other applications\n(see Glasserman and Kim [13] and and Kaeck and Alexandex\n[14], for example). In the case of single-factor stochastic\nvolatility model, one of the parameters of the model is the\ncorrelation coefficient between the underlying asset and its\ninstantaneous variance. However, the assumption of a single\nfactor in this model does not provide sufficient flexibility to\naccount for the stochastic behavior of the volatility skew\nHindawi\nComplexity\nVolume 2020, Article ID 1960121, 15 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1960121\n', 'observed in option markets and leads to incorrect pricing\nformulas for deep in-and-out-of-the money European\noptions.\nIn a parallel development, two-factor stochastic volatility\nmodels (TSV) have generated attention from the optionpricing\nliterature. Christonffersen et al. [15] and Fouque et al.\n[16] extend Heston’s model to generate a two-factor stochastic\nvolatility model, which is able to account for the stochastic\ncorrelation between the asset return and its instantaneous\nvariance. Another extension to Heston’s model is proposed by\n[17] who consider a matrix Wishart diffusion process to introduce\na correlation structure between the asset returns and its\nvolatility factors (denoted as theMSVmodel). Gourieroux [18]\nand Gourieroux and Sufana [19] consider the Wishart\nAutoregressive (WAR) diffusion processes to model volatility\nprocess of the underlying asset. Recently, Muhle-Karbe et al.\n[20] develop a multivariate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck stochastic\nvolatility model based on Lévy process. As demonstrated in\n[17], the main advantage of the MSV model is that it can\ncalibrate short-term and long-term volatility levels better than a\nsingle-factor one. Recently, theMSVmodel has been applied to\nvalue exotic options (seeWong and Chan [21], Romo [22], and\nZhong and Deng [23], for example).\nAlthough the MSV model may be useful for option\npricing, it is unsuccessful in the modeling of certain financial\nasset returns. (ere is empirical evidence suggesting that\nvolatility jumps cannot be recaptured by a diffusion model\nonly (see Jacod and Todorov [24]). Bates [25] and Chernov\net al. [26] find that neither one volatility factor model with\njumps nor affine two-factor specifications are well equipped\nto handle the very short-lived but erratic extreme events\ntypically found during financial crisis. For these reasons, this\npaper aims to extend the MSV model incorporating jump\ncomponents in asset returns and its volatilities, which can\nimprove the pricing performance of the AJD and MSV\nmodels, and also offer a potentially convenient framework\nfor modeling term structure.\n(is paper contributes to the literature in the following\nways. We derive a semianalytic formulas for the prices of\nEuropean vanilla options in a two-factor stochastic volatility\njump-diffusion model by using the martingale method and\nFourier transform technique. (is enables us to understand\nhow our proposed model can be adjusted to fit volatility\nsmiles and the real data. We also obtain a fast and accurate\nnumerical solution for the European option pricing by the\nFast Fourier transform (FFT) technique. (is allows us to\nassess the impacts of the jump components in the two-factor\nvolatility on option price.\n(e outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces\nthe model. (e characteristic function of the log-stock\nprice and the semianalytical formula for the European call\noption are derived. An approximation solution for this\noption pricing by FFT is also provided. Computational results\nand empirical analysis are reported in Section 3. Section\n4 concludes the paper. In this section, we proposed the\nfollowing model for the asset price dynamics which is driven\nby two-factor stochastic volatility jump-diffusion models.\nUnder this proposed model, we derive the semianalytic form\nfor option price and then provide a fast and accurate numerical\nmethod using FFT technique.\n2. Asset Price Dynamics\nConsider an arbitrage-free, frictionless financial economy\nconsisting of two assets, namely, a bank account B and a\nrisky stock S, which are traded continuously over a finite\ntime interval [0, T]. Let (Ω,F, Ft\U0010ff08 \U0010ff09t≥ 0, Q) be a complete\nprobability space with filtrated σ-field Ft, on which are\ndefined a four-dimensional standard Wiener process\nWt � (W1t, W2t, W3t, W4t), three-dimensional Poisson\nprocesses Nt � (N1,t, N2,t, N3,t), and three-dimensional\nrandom jump size sequences J � (J1, J2, J3). Assume that all\nuncertainties on this probability space are mutually independent\nand Ft is generated by these uncertainties.\nWe assume that the joint dynamics of the stock price St\nand its variance processes are specified under some riskneutral\nprobability measure Q (see [12]) by the following\nsystem of stochastic differential equation:\ndSt\nSt\n� (r − δ − λμ)dt +\n���\nv1,t\n\U0010ff70\nρ1dW1,t +\n�����\n1 − ρ21\n\U0010ff71\ndW3,t\U0010ff12 \U0010ff13\n+\n���\nv2,t\n\U0010ff70\nρ2dW2,t +\n�����\n1 − ρ22\n\U0010ff71\ndW4,t\U0010ff12 \U0010ff13 + e\nJ1 − 1\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11dN1,t,\ndv1,t � κ1 θ1 − v1,t\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11dt + σ1\n���\nv1,t\n\U0010ff70\ndW1,t + J2dN2,t,\ndv2,t � κ2 θ2 − v2,t\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11dt + σ2\n���\nv2,t\n\U0010ff70\ndW2,t + J3dN3,t,\n(1)\nwhere r and δ are constant risk-free interest and dividend\nyields, respectively, v1,t and v2,t are stochastic variances with\nthemean reversion speeds κ1 and κ2, the long-term variances\nθ1 and θ2, and the volatilities of the variances σ1 and σ2,\nrespectively, and ρ1 and ρ2 denote the correlation coefficients\nbetween the Wiener processes driving the log-stock price\nand the two variance processes, respectively. (e Poisson\nprocesses Ni,t are assumed to have constant intensities λi for\ni � 1, 2, 3.

To ensure positivity of vj,t the parameters must be\n2 Complexity\n', 'chosen such that 2κjθj ≥ σ2j for j � 1, 2. We will refer this\nspecification as the TSVIJ model.\n(e TSVIJ model nests some popular models in option\npricing. Without considering jumps in both returns and\nvolatilities, the TSVIJ model can be reduced to the TSV\nmodels (called also the double Heston model) considered by\nChernov et al. [26] and LeBaron [27]. If we consider a singlefactor\nvolatility process (denoted the SVIJ model for short)\nonly in (1), the SVIJ model discussed by Chernov [11] can be\nregarded as a particular case of the TSVIJ model. When we\nconsider the single-factor volatility process without jumps,\nthe TSVIJ model can be reduced to the SVJ model discussed\nby Bates [4]. Without jumps in both returns and variance\nprocess and with considering a single-factor volatility process\nonly, the TSVIJ model is degenerated to the SV model\nconsidered by Heston [3]. We have the normal jump-diffusion\nmodel (denoted as Merton model) considered by\nMerton [2] without considering the stochastic volatility\nmodel in (1).\n(e TSVIJ model specified in (1), unlike the SVIJ and SV\nmodel, accounts for a richer variance-covariance structure.\nIn particular, the total conditional variance of the stock\nreturn process is the sum of the two variance factors plus\njumps:\nVt ≔\n1\ndt\nVar d ln St Ft\n\U0010ff0c\U0010ff0c\U0010ff0c\U0010ff0c\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11 \U0010ff62�\n1\ndt\nVart d ln St( \U0010ff01 � v1,t + v2,t + λ1 μ\n2\ns + σ\n2\ns\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11\U0010ff6e \U0010ff6f, (4)\nwhereas, as shown by Eraker et al. [10], the conditional\nvariance of the variance processes and the correlation between\nthe stock return and the variance process are given by\n1\ndt\nVart dVt( \U0010ff01 � \U0010ff58\n2\nj�1\nσ2jvj,t + 2λj+1η\n2\nj\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11, (5)\nρSt,Vt � Corrt d ln St, dVt( \U0010ff01\n�\nρ1σ1v1,t + ρ2σ2v2,t�������������������������\nσ21v1,t + σ\n2\n2v2,t + 2 λ2η\n2\n1 + λ3η\n2\n2\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11\n\U0010ff71\n×\n1\n������������������\nv1,t + v2,t + λ1 μ\n2\ns + σ\n2\ns\U0010ff10 \U0010ff11\n\U0010ff71 ,\n(6)\nrespectively. Note that the correlation between the stock\nreturn and variance is determined by ρ1 and ρ2 and depends\non the current levels of both the factors and jumps. It is an\nimportant scale for modeling the leverage effect which\nimplies a stochastic correlation.\n(ere are two important advantages of the TSVIJ model\nwith respect to the SVIJ/or SV model. First, the TSVIJ model\ndisplays not only stochastic variance but also stochastic correlation\nbetween stock return and variance, and this feature\npotentially enables the model to capture fluctuations in option\nskewness. Second, the TSVIJ model provides more flexibility to\nmodeling volatility term structure; one of the factors determines\nthe correlation between short-term stock return and\nvariance process, while the other factor determines long-term\nstock return and variance process.\n2.1. +e Characteristic Function. Given the asset price\ndynamics specified in (1), it is possible to obtain the\ncharacteristic function of the log-stock price. Let\nXt � ln St. Applying the generalized Itô formula to the first\nequation in (1), the evolution of the log-stock price is\ndescribed by\ndXt � r − δ −\nv1,t + v2,t\n2\n− λμ\U0010ff12 \U0010ff13dt\n+\n���\nv1,t\n\U0010ff70\nρ1dW1,t +\n�����\n1 − ρ21\n\U0010ff71\ndW3,t\U0010ff12 \U0010ff13\n+\n���\nv2,t\n\U0010ff70\nρ2dW2,t +\n�����\n1 − ρ22\n\U0010ff71\ndW4,t\U0010ff12 \U0010ff13 + J1dN1,t.\n(7)\nIn the following, we use the martingale method and\ngeneralized Itô formula to derive the characteristic function\nwhose solution is present in the lemma below.\nLemma 1.

See Appendix A.\nWith the characteristic function available, European\noptions can be valued using the Fourier transform method\n(FT). (ere are increasing research efforts in option pricing\nusing the FT method. For example, Carr and Madan [28]\nillustrated the fundamental idea of using the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) for computing European vanilla options\nbased on the characteristic function of the log-asset value.\nDuffie et al. [12] provide a comprehensive survey on the FT\napproach to option pricing in a wide range of stochastic\nprocesses. Dempster and Hoog [29] developed an approximation\nmethod for pricing European options on\nspreads using the two-dimensional FFT. Pillay and O’Hara\n[9] and Zhang and Wang [6, 7] also use the FFT technique\nto pricing European options under the stochastic volatility\nmodel with/without jumps. Wong and Zhao [30] use a\nmodified FFTmethod (FRFT), namely, the fractional FFT,\nto value currency options. Černý [31] presented a detailed\ndiscussion on the implementation of FFT to option pricing.\nIn Section 2.2, we examine how these methods can be used\nto our case.\n2.2. Semianalytical Formula. Now, we consider a European\nvanilla call option pricing. Let K be the strike price and T the\nmaturity of a European call option. (e price at time 0 of the\nEuropean call option, denoted by C(S), is computed as the\ndiscounted risk-neutral conditional expectation of the terminal\npayoff max ST − K, 0\U0010ff08 \U0010ff09 � (ST − K)\n+ as follows:\nC(S) � E e\n− rT\nST − K( \U0010ff01\n+\n\U0010ff6e \U0010ff6f.

However, the call options with\nvery short maturity or out-of-the money options have no\nintrinsic value. (is causes the integrand in the Fourier\ninversion to be high oscillate.

In practice, one may determine an upper bound\non the damping parameter α from the analytical expression\nfor the characteristic function and the condition\nE(Sα+1T )<∞. Carr and Madan [28] found that one-fourth of\nthis upper bound serves as a good choice for α (>1 for calls,\n>0 for puts) and the impact of the damping factor on the\noption price is not significant.\n3. Numerical Experiments\nIn this section, we present some numerical results. First, we\nreport the numerical experiments that were performed on\npricing options using two techniques: the FFTand theMonte\nCarlo (MC) simulation method. Next, we use the FFT to\nfurther investigate the volatility smile and the distributional\nproperties implied by our proposed model (TSVIJ). We\nanalyze further the effects of volatility jump components and\ncorrelation coefficients on option prices under the TSVIJ\nmodel. Finally, we describe the market data used for empirical\nstudy and estimate the risk-neutral model parameters\nfrom option prices on a set of days in various models\nincluding the TSVIJ, the SVIJ, SV, Merton, and the BS\nmodels as benchmarks.\n3.1. Performance of FFT. Having presented the FFT algorithm\nas outlined above, it would be interesting to investigate\nthe performance of FFT implemented to price option under\nour proposed model. We have also implemented the MC\nmethod for comparison purposes. For the FFT method,\naccording to Remark 1 and by means of the given setting of\nmodel parameters in Table 1, we used the damping parameter\nα � 1.9, Δ � 0.5, and N � 2048. For the MC sim-\nulation, we apply the Euler scheme for the numerical\nsimulation of the log-asset price and variance processes. In\norder to achieve high accuracy, the simulation is repeated\n10,000 times and the time step is kept at 0.02. Other parameter\nvalues used in the numerical computation are listed\nin Table 1. Two methods were implemented in MATLAB\nR2015b and on the PC with Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU\n2.80GHz. Results of the numerical experiment are presented\nin Table 2.\nTable 2 reports the results for 9 call option prices with\ndifferent strike prices (from deep-in-the-money (ITM) to atthe-money\n(ATM) and deep-out-of-money (OTM)) ob-\ntained using the FFT method and the Monte Carlo simulations.\nColumn one lists the strike price K for the options.\nColumns two to five list the FFT and the MC simulation\nprices for both T � 0.5 and T � 1. (e numbers in parentheses\nare difference between the two methods. If we use the\nMonte Carlo simulation as the benchmark, we can see from\nTable 2 that the absolute percentage differences of the FFT\nmethod are less than 1% for all cases.\n(e FFTmethod takes less than 2 seconds to produce 150\noption prices corresponding to different strike prices. (e\nMonte Carlo simulation takes more than 90 seconds for each\noption price. (ese numerical experiments show that our\nanalytic solution is correct, and the FFTmethod is accurate\nand efficient.\n3.2. Implied Volatility. (e clear advantage of the FFT\nmethod enables us to further investigate the volatility smile\nimplied by our proposed model. For the implied volatility\ncalculations, we use two terms to maturity date: 0.5 year\n(short-term) and one year (long-term). We use the model\nparameters taken from Table 1 and vary the strike price\nfrom 50 to 150, to generate an implied volatility graph.\nFigure 1 displays the implied volatility curves for three\ndifferent models, including the Merton, SVIJ, and TSVIJ\nmodels.\nAs can be seen from Figure 1, for both maturities, the\ncurvature of the implied volatility curves for the TSVIJ\nmodel are significantly decreased, and the difference between\nthe Merton, SVIJ, and TSVIJ implied volatility curves\nis quite large. (is should not be a surprise, as jumps in two\nvariance processes increase the conditional variance of the\nunderlying asset. Furthermore, the TSVIJ model generates\nvery greater the left-tail skewness, especially for short maturity,\nwhich should be valid for the real-world option\nmarket and the best framework describing asset price\n6 Complexity\n', 'dynamics. (is indicates the advantage of the two-factor\nstochastic volatility model with jumps, with respect to the\njumps only in returns (the Merton model) and the singlefactor\nstochastic volatility model with/without jumps (the\nSVIJ/SV model), is that the two-factor stochastic volatility\nmodel with jumps in volatility provides more flexibility to\ncapture the volatility smile since one of the factors determines\nthe correlation between short-term asset’s returns and\nvariance, whereas the other factor determines the correlation\nbetween long-term asset’s returns and variance.\nNext, we examine how the volatility smile varies with the\nmodel parameter values of the variance process. We focus on\ninvestigating the effects of three parameters, two volatility\njump components, λ2 and η1, and correlation coefficient, ρ1,\non the volatility smile. We compute the prices for call option\nwith T � 1 year maturity by FFT under the TSVIJ model;\nTable 1: Parameter settings for numerical examples.\nModel parameters κ1 θ1 σ1 η1 ρ1 λ2 v1,0 κ2 θ2 σ2 η2 ρ2 λ3 v2,0 μs σs λ13 0.06 0.1 0.2 -0.4 0.3 0.02 4 0.08 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.9 0.04 − 0.1 0.15 2\nMarket data S0 r δ100 0.03 0.02\nTable 2: Option prices using FFT and MC methods.\nStrike price K\nT � 0.5 T � 1\nFFT MC % difference FFT MC % difference\n80 24.4535 24.4436 0.041 29.3599 29.3706 − 0.037\n85 21.0528 21.0493 0.017 26.5915 26.5940 − 0.008\n90 18.0228 17.9840 0.216 24.0435 24.0488 − 0.021\n95 15.2760 15.2562 0.131 21.7258 21.7259 0.000\n100 12.8038 12.8628 − 0.459 19.6043 19.6138 − 0.046\n105 10.8479 10.7902 0.538 17.7122 17.6996 0.073\n110 9.0230 9.0164 0.078 15.9710 15.9695 0.013\n115 7.4396 7.5140 − 0.985 14.4212 14.4094 0.082\n120 6.2756 6.2526 0.368 13.0154 13.0053 0.077\nCPU time (s) 0.086 906.25 0.080 889.76\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5\n0.38\n0.4\n0.42\n0.44\n0.46\n0.48\n0.5\n0.52\n0.54\n0.56\nK/S0\nIm\npl\nie\nd \nvo\nla\ntil\nity\nT = 0.5 year\nMerton model\nSVIJ model\nTSVIJ model\n(a)\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5\nK/S0\nMerton model\nSVIJ model\nTSVIJ model\n0.4\n0.42\n0.44\n0.46\n0.48\n0.5\n0.52\n0.54\nIm\npl\nie\nd \nvo\nla\ntil\nity\nT = 1 year\n(b)\nFigure 1: Implied volatility for three models with short and long maturities.\nComplexity 7\n', 'then, we take those prices as market prices of option and\ncompute the implied volatilities using the BS model. (e\nresults are plotted in Figures 2–4.\nFirst, we can seen from Figure 2 that an increase in λ2,\nthe arrive intensity of the volatility jumps, increases the\nimplied volatility. (is implies that the BS model systematically\nundervalues all options. A similar argument holds\nfor η1, the mean of the volatility jumps (see Figure 3).\nSecond, the levels of the implied volatilities depend on the\nsign and magnitudes of correlation coefficient ρ1 between\nthe volatility and asset (see Figure 4), whereas the levels of\nthe implied volatilities at the lower strikes drop with increasing\ncorrelation ρ1 and ones at higher strikes go up. (is\nfeature is consistent with the models with stochastic volatility\nwithout jumps in volatility. (us, the proposed model\nmaintains some properties of the models being of stochastic\nvolatility. We stress, however, that this model enables option\nprices to fit the forward price term structure exactly.\n3.3. Probability Densities. We now go one step further and\nexamine the distributional properties of the TSVIJ model\nusing the FFTmethod. It is also instructive to compare the\nshort-term and long-term probability density functions of\nTSVIJ, SVIJ, and Merton’s models.

Positive correlations lead to a high\nvariance when the stock return increases, which fattens the\nright tail of the density function.(is is consistent with those\nin Wong and Zhao [30].\nFigures 6 and 7 provide the impacts of the volatility jump\ncomponents, λ2, λ3, η1, and η2 in the TSVIJ model on\nprobability densities of the log-return.

A similar argument holds for the means of the\nvolatility jumps, η1 and η2 (see Figure 7).\nFigure 8 provides comparisons of the short-term\n(T � 0.5 year) and long-term (T � 1 year) probability\ndensities of the TSVIJ, SVIJ, and Merton’s models. Figure 8\nshows that the probability density of the TSVIJ model is\ndistinctly different; it has very high peak and skewness\nfeatures compared to those of the SVIJ and Merton models\nfor both maturities. Moreover, for both maturity density\ncurves in Figure 8 still show that the density of the TSVIJ\nmodel attenuates heavy tails on both sides. (erefore, the\nTSVIJ model can correct the pricing bias in the BS model\nand has a potential application in practice.\n3.4. SensitivityAnalysis. As said previously, the TSVIJ model\nprovides more flexibility than the single-factor specification\nto model the volatility term structure and probability density\nof asset returns. (is section considers the effects of the\nmodel parameters, including the correlation coefficients ρ1\nand ρ2, the arrive intensities λ2 and λ3 of volatility jumps,\nand the means η1 and η2 of volatility jumps, on the option\nprices. We analyze the prices of T�1 year call option only.\nModel parameter values are taken from Table 1 apart from\nρ1, ρ2, λ2, λ3, η1, and η2. (e numerical results are displayed\nin Table 3.\nFrom Table 3, we can see that (i) option prices are very\nsensible to η1 and η2. Since η1 and η2 indicate the means of\nthe volatility jumps, this sensitivity can be considered as the\nsensitivity of option prices to their volatilities, which are\nverified by equation (2). A similar argument holds for the\narrive intensities λ2 and λ3 of the volatility jumps. (ii) Option\nprices with different strike prices have different sensitivities\nto the correlations ρ1 and ρ2, whereas in-the-money options\n(K � 80, 85, 90, 95) decrease in values with increasing correlations\nρ1 and ρ2, at-the-money options (K � 100), and\nout-the-money options (K � 105, 110, 115, 120) go up.

Considering the RMSE and ARPE values, the\nTSVIJ model best fits the market prices in the in-sample\ndata, followed by the SV, SVIJ, Merton, and the BS models.\nTaking a closer look at the estimates, the jump-related parameter\n(λ1, λ2, λ3, μs, σs, η1, η2) in the TSVIJ model is sig-\nnificant, suggesting that modeling the asset dynamics and its\nvariance processes cannot ignore the jump components.\nUsing these results in Table 5, themodel predicted values and\nits comparison with market prices of the out-of sample data are\nshown in Table 6. As the table shows, the TSVIJmodel provides a\ngood fit for most traded options in a lower RMSE value.\n4. Conclusion\n(is paper proposes a multifactor variance processes model\n(TSVIJ model) for European option pricing, with jumps in\nboth asset’s returns and variances, which is a reasonable and\nnatural extension of the two-factor stochastic volatility\nmodel, Merton’s jump-diffusion model, and the affine jumpdiffusion\nmodel. Based on the martingale method and\nFourier transform technique, we also obtain closed-form\nsolutions for the characteristic function and European call\noption. Using FFT, we obtain accurate and efficient numerical\nalgorithm for pricing option within this proposed\nmodel. Comparisons of both the implied volatility curves\nand probability densities under alternative models show that\nthe proposed model has better pricing performance. (e\nanalysis of the proposed model empirically shows its ability\nto handle pricing problem much better than the SVIJ, SV,\nMerton, and the BS models. Once the model parameters\nhave been calibrated to fit market prices, the proposedmodel\ncan be used to price other products that are not actively\ntraded in the market. An analysis of this model also reveals\nthat the volatility jump components have a strong impact on\noption prices. Although the independent arriving jumps in\nvolatilities and jumps in returns are considered in the\nproposed model, we recognize that it could also be extended\nto jumps occurring simultaneously in both returns and\nvariances by slightly modifying the framework of this model.\nAppendix\nA.
