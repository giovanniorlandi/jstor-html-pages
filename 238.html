Watson, president of Arkansas\nState College for Negroes, says that none need arise if the\narmy would cultivate the local community to which Negro\nsoldiers are to be brought by sending ahead officers to\nconfer with local officials and leading citizens. “A confer\nence with city and county officers and ministers would\nhelp prepare the community for the unusual experience of\nhaving in their midst Negro soldiers with army guns and\ngovernment uniforms.”\nPresident Watson believes that the government ought\nalso to prepare the Negro soldiers for an experience equally\nnew and strange to them. He supports these statements\nwith the story of the manner in which Pine Bluff handled\nits Negro troops—the 92nd Battalion and another contin\ngent of one thousand direct from Fort Bragg. “The result\n(of such preliminary conferences) was that both these\ngroups of Negro soldiers came and went without a notice\nable incident.”\nReorganize Military Police\nGeneral Benjamin 0. Davis with two white officers\nsent to investigate the disturbances at Fort Bragg, N. C.\nhas made a report to the War Department containing re\ncommendations for improving conditions. He suggests that\nan experienced officer be sent as provost marshal to or\nganize and train white and colored MP’s; that a military\npolice headquarters be established in nearby Fayetteville;\nthat a unified Negro and white military police be set up\nwith equal equipment and equal authority.\nGeneral Davis expressed the opinion that the Negro\npress had greatly exaggerated the difficulties at Fort\nBragg. In reporting the official visit, the Negro press said\nthat General Davis had been shown the greatest respect\nand courtesy but he had been treated as are all Negro\nofficers— “he was quartered in jim crow officers’ quart\ners during his stay.”\n‘Negroes to Die for Democracy Slinging Hash”—editorial\ncomment by a Negro editor on the call for 1,100 Negro\nmess attendants sent out by the Navy.
