"The farmers are all busy over in that section of\nthe country. While their brothers in the north are\nwailing for the big spring thaw along in April and May\nand hugging costly fires, they are out in the fields with\ntheir mules and long furrows of upturned earth are\npromising fine crops in that section thia summer. Corn\nand alfalfa are the products most of them are relying\non this year. Cotton is a mere side issue, and they are\ninterested in raising crops that will feed the cattle they\nare raising and buying."\nGEORGE WASHINGTON AS A FARMER.\nWhile the people are perhaps more familiar with\nthe history of George Washington, whose birthday oc\ncurred Tuesday, than with that of any other of Ameri\nca\'s great warriors, patriots and statesmen, few of them\nTcnow anything concerning his work as a farmer, and\nthis feature of his career is emphasized in a recently\'\npublished book entitled, "George Washington Farmer,"\nby Paul Leland Howarth.\nThe book dals with the bucolic life of one of the\nworld\'s greatest men, and should furnish an incentive\nto boys on the farm, as it depicts the profit and pleasure\nwhich this learned statesman and military strategist de\nrived from so simple a task as tilling the soil and the cul\ntivation of agricultural products.\nMr. Haworth quotes from a letter written by Gen.\nWashington to Arthur Young in 1788, in which he says:\n"The more I am acquainted with agricultural affairs the\nbetter I like them. I can nowhere find so great satis\nfaction as in those innocent and useful pursuits. In in\ndulging these feelings I am led to reflect how much more\ndelightful to an undebauched mind is the task of making\nimprovements on the earth than all the vainglory which\ncan be acquired from ravaging it, by the most uninter\nrupted career of conquests."\nThis is indeed a noble sentiment, and one to which\nevery boy on every farm throughout the country should\ndevote serious thought and consideration.\nThe Memphis Business Men\'s Club has offered a\nprize f ten dollars for the best essay giving reasons\n4\nwhy people should go to the West Tennessee metropolis\nto live. We don\'t know any reason why a person should\ndesire to live there, but recent exposures of the ille\ngal manner in which the courts presided over by Judge\nPalmer and Judge Eddington were conducted seem to\nfurnish two very good reasons for not going there, un\nless a person is willing to reside in a city where protec\ntion by the courts is not guaranteed.\nMayor Crump, of Memphis, is jubilant because the\nsupreme court of Tennessee has decided that he is legal\nly entitled to hold the office from which he was recent\nly ousted, but his opponents assert that they will soon\nThe New Orlenns Times-Picayune is publishing a\nseries of articles showing the rottenesa of the manage\nment of the East Louisiana Insane Asylum, and is\n"piercing" Dr. Clarence H.
