He told\nthe tobacco men of Lincoln that they\nhate been milking their brothers\' cow\nthrough the rence, riding on tho wave\nor high prices nnd getting tho benellt\nwhile lr members of the pool did the\nwork. The time has come now, when\njnless the growers In this Section\npool, the fight to keep up hlh prices\nis going to bo lost.\nMr Wilson nado a clear nnd con\nvincing argument, and at the con\nclusion of his address InVlted the\nmeeting to ol.ect three representative\ndelegates to attend the meeting ot\nthe Hurley Tobacco Society in Lex\nIncton Tuesday and report back tholr\nhonest opinion to the home growers,\nYho meeting selected C.

He said aa simply wanted\nthe growers to know what It wns he\nwas adtocatlng and wanted them to\ninvestigate.\nThe rert which these three dele\nKates will make back will undoubted\nly earn- n.uch weight. They are\namong the most represcntatlte farm\ners and tobacco ror3 of the coun\nty. There Is a rapidly growing aentl\n.nent in Lincoln In lavor of pooling\nthis year\'s crop. There is scarcely\nanyone, however, even who does not.\njooI. but who admits the success of\nprevious pools has been responsible\nor the high prices recelted for to-\nucco, and wants to see It succeed\nt?atn. .\nFought Over "Hand"\nAND WHEN THEY FINISHED\nWAS MISSING.\nHE\n"Hands" are hard to obtain In to\nMicro, corn and wbeat fields in Lin\n")ln county Just now, and when a\ntrapping colored man appeared on\nthe f.inn of M.
