A Modern City Hospital.\nHOW ABOUT RUSSIA?\nThe people of our country didn\'t un\nderstand Russia before the beginning of the\nwar. We welcomed them as partners in the\night against the Axis —but we still don’t\njndersiand them. It is doubtful whether\nwe ever will. Russia isn\'t at war with Japan.\nStalin and his government seem to appre\nciate the six billions of dollars of war and\naid supplies from the United States. On the\nother hand. Stalin continues to complain\nabout what he says is the failure by\nthe United States and Britain to establish a\nwestern front, even though forces have\ncleaned up North Africa and the Mediter\nranean. wiped out the power of Sicily and\nItaly, and brought the French people to h\npoint where they are ready \\o rejoin our\nfighting forces. Besides, we have bombed\nthe daylights out of Germany itself, and\nhave made it possible for Sweden to stop\nHitler\'s force from carrying on their traffic\nbetween Norway and the German lines.\nThe man who looks at the map of th-?\nworld on the walls of an office in Washing\nion finds it difficult to understand the cri’i\nt ism that comes out of Russia.\nMeanwhile the war goes on. It is per\nfectly clear, as it has been at all time.- th.t\nthe Atlantic Charter representing the prin\nciples of government as understood by th\nPresident of the United States ami th*-\nPrime Minister of Great Britain never gain\ned the approval of Russia, any more than\nthe common doctrines of Russia will ever bt*\naccepted by Britain and our country.\nThe fact is the English speaking people\nar.d the Russians and Chinese don’t believ;\nn the same political and social theories.\nAll this ought not to obscure the fact\nthat the United States. Britain, Russia,\n< hina and the rest of us are all fighting th\nfame demies. There is no difference of\nopinion on that score. Inasmuch as we agr-*"\nabout the war it seems reasonable to hope\nand expect that after victory has been won\nthe victories of peace will also he won.\nWhen we think “How about Russia?” \\v\nmust be broad-minded enough to acknowl\nedge tr.at the Russians have gone farther\nhan the rest of us in the great struggle • *\ncrush Hitlerism as it exists throughout the\nworld.

But why resort to iese majesty, or\nsomething of the sort? Believe it or not. the\nscavenger men are the most independent\nworkm-n in Key West. Raise a brow of dis\napproval. and they will throw up their job*.\nSt* what i< to be done?\nThose men are well aware that the city\nand its manager of the scavenger service\nare up against the same thing that the gov\nernment is in some regards. It was for that\ni very reason that the War Manpower Com\nin ssion was organized. There were, and still\nare. insufficient numbers of workers i*i\nsome trades, and the commission’s job is to\ncull here and cull there to get men and place\nthem where they are needed most.\nA good idea, in this scavenger situa\ntion. would be for Key Westers, singly or\nin groups, to make themselves a self-ap\npointed manpower commission. If you know\nof men. white or black, who wish to work on\nthe trash wagons, give their names to the\nmanager of the City Hall. The sole prob\nlem that he faces is to get enough men of\ntile right kind to do the work. Help to give\nhim men, and he assures you ’hat vuu will\nhe giv “i> hang-up service.\nSuggestions have been offered that the\nNavy !e asked to take over the service, hut\nThe Citizen agrees with an astute Kov\nWest business woman’s comment on that\nj n posal:\n“The government is doing too much for\nus now; it\'s up lo us to do something for\nourselves. Si me people seem to he satisfied\nto let he government th* everything, not\naware that that attitude robs us of the very\nthings that brought our country to its pres\nent scale of greatness initiative and en\nterprise. The men to improve the scavenger\nsituation are councilmen there\'s\nno sidestepping that glaring fact.”\nYes. as The Citizen said before, iris up\nto the councilmen. They were elected : o\nconduct the affair- of the city, whether they\nrun along smoothly or develop knotty prob\nlems. There i- -ome way out of every prob\nlem. if a man or men work hard enough to\nsolve If -ome of the -cavenger crews are\nnot giving service, of what consequence is\nit in keeping *hem? Get men who will give\nservice. **\\en though they have to be paid\nhigher wag* -. for the tra-h and the garbage\nmust he taken away regularly.\nThe Citizen ha- been informed official\nly that the scavenger department has one\ngo* and crew of workmen. It is ea-y enough for\nthe councilmen to lean, the names of the \'\nmen comprising tha’ crew.
