T’ ARLY in my career, while follow\n1 i ing the western circuit, I acted\non occasions as junior to Sergt. Saun\nders, a man notorious for taking more\nwork than he could perform, and then\ngetting through with it brilliantly.\nOn going into court one morning\nhe hurriedly besought me to take a\ncase of his, “a very simple affair,” he\nsaid. 1 yielded, and within two min\nutes found myself charged with one\nof the most difficult defenses that ever\n(barrister attempted.\nThe facts were simple, terribly\nsimple, Hy client—awkward, good\nlooking, but not very intelligent—\nwas the s>n of a farmer, lie bad left\nhis home, and now stood arraigned\nfor btirglt riously entering his father\'s\nhouse, while that father was away in\nLondon, i nd attempting to open an\niron safe, which was kept, of all queer\nplaces in the world, in the pantry.\nHut the great, the strongest fact\nagainst us was that the testimony of\nmy client\'s own mother was to be\ngiven against her son.\nShe told in her hushed voice and\ngasping tones how she had been\naroused during the night By a serv\nant; how, hearing a noise below, she\nhad gone down alone—the girl being\ntoo frightened to accompany her—\nhow she had then seen her boy, the\ndarling of her heart, fumbling at the\ndoor of the safe, and how, seeing her,\nhe had turned and fled through the\n. open window.\nNow it struck me as being curious\nthat a woman who had given evidence\nwith such obvious reluctance against\nher son should have done so volun\ntarily. Something, some fact or some\nperson, it seemed to me, must have\ncompelled her to say it was her son\nshe saw.\nThe next witness was a business\nlike girl, who gave her evidence with\nout the least reluctance. She stated\nthat on hearing a noise she had\naroused her mistress and allowed her\nto descend alone. As her mistress did\nnot return, however, she summoned\nanother servant, and together they\nwent downstairs to find their mistress\nin a swoon. Then, just as the crown\ncounsel was sitting down, she added,\nin an unhappy burst of self-import\nance:\n“And next day I gave information\nto the police.”\n“Indeed,” said I. rising quickly,\n•nd what did you tell them?”\n\'■i told them that missis had gone\ndown during the night and found\nMaster Rupert (the prisoner) trying\nto open the safe.”\nImmediately I shot the question at\nher: “And where did you get your\ninformation?” and, at once, her man\nner changed. She hesitated, red\ndened, stammered: then, with a sud\nden instinct, she pointed to where the\nprisoner’s mother was sitting.\n“She told me,” said the girl.\nThen a striking scene followed. The\nprisoner’s mother rose slowly, and\nsaid:\n“I never told her, my lord. What\nthe girl says is not true. I would\nhave told no one unless I had been\ncompelled.”\n“When do you say your mistress\ntold you this?” I asked.\n"About 11 o\'clock next morning,”\nthe girl answered.\n“And at what time did you com\nmunicate with the police?"\n“About, two.”\n“Whom did you tell meanwhile?”\n“No one.”\n“What! You went about knowing\nthe guilty party, and never speaking.\nAt least you told your fellow serv\nants?”\n“We knew it,” she said.\n“Knew it,” I shouted, ironically;\n“knew it was the prisoner who had\ntried to open the safe. Pray how did\nyou know it if you did not see the\nact committed?”\n“I mean that when we heard that\nthere had been a burglary we thought\nthat Muster Rupert had done it.”\n“Why?” I asked.\n“Recause”—she faltered—“Master\nRupert had ran away from home and\n1 did not trust him."\n“In fact,” I said, “you did not like\nhim?"\n‘ No," said the girl, then stopped\nand bit her lip.\nAgain I asked her why.\n“He came between me and his\nbrother,” she answered, hotly and de\nfiantly.\n“His brother! This is the first we !\nhave heard of his brother,” and I\nturned to the crown counsel, whose\nfeatures had a look of unruffled pla\ncidity. Then to the girl I said:\n“And where was his brother on the\nsight this burglary took place?”\nThat the question touched home I\nsaw in an instant. The girl paled and\ntrembled, but she answered steadily:\n“I do not know.”\nSomething told me the other broth\ner was the pivot on which the whole\ncase turned. I let the girl go, and\nasked that the mother might be re\ncalled, deploring meanwhile the fact\nthat I had had no opportunity of con\naulting my client.\nStates.. She entered the box with a look of\ni(3^gng on her face, as though I\nafter all be able to do some\n\'•ipg ffcr her son. I asked the moth\nKer^son had left home.\nshe said. “I have\n“Have you seen him during that\ntime?" i\n••No."\n"Now as to this aafe. What were\nits contents?"\n“It had my husband’s savings. Four\nhundred pounds in notes. He would\nnot trust a bank."\n“And how touch of this was miss\ning?”\nThe crown counsel stopped me.\n“My lord,” he\' said, “this is quite im\nmaterial. It Is not necessary to our\ncase that the prisoner stole anything.\nWhat we suggest is that he was about\nto open the safe when frightened by\nthe appearance of his mother, and he\nturned and fled.”\n“But,” I objected, “it wns his fa\nther\'s house. He had only been ab\nsent from it two days. Surely he\nhad a right to return. To sustain this\ncharge you must show evil intent."\nI waited eagerly for the next wit\nness.\nIt was one the prosecution ought\nnever to have called.\nHe was a farm lad, who slept in an\nouthouse, and had been disturbed by\na noise during the night in question.\nHe had seen the retreating figure of\na man he took to be the prisoner.\nIn explaining this he made a curious\nstatement. “I tried to sleep lightly\nbecause after Master Dick’s visit I\nthought it best to be wakeful with\nmaster away.”\n“Master Dick” was the prisoner’s\nbrother.\nWhen did the visit of the prison\ner’s brother take place?” and noticed,\nas I did so, the start of surprise with\nwhich the prisoner\'s mother heard\nthe question.\n“Two days before th "3 burglary\nhe said.\n“And who saw him?”\n“I saw\' him, and Margaret spoke to\nhim.”\nMargaret was the girl who had pre\nviously given evidence.\n“Xo one else?”\n“Xo,” said the boy. “You see it\nwas in the middle of the night.”\n“Can you tell us anything more\nabout this night visit of the prisoner\'s\nbrother?”\nThe boy relnted how he had heard\na noise. How he had got up, dressed\nand walked toward the farmhouse.\nHow he had wnited and watched a\nthin streak of light move steadily\naround from room to room till it\nreached the pnntry, where it stayed\nsome time. How he had still waited,\nnnd after remaining outside for near\nly half an hour had seen the girl Mar\ngaret let out Master Dick through\nthe side door.\n“Did you tell any one this?” I\nasked.\nYes, he had told the prisoner, but"\nhad not told his mistress for fear of\nalarming her. I could see daylight\nnow.\nHut I still anticipated*a tough fight.\n1 did not realize what a valuable ally\na little truth may be.\nThe next witness, the othei maid\nservant at the farmhouse, entered the\nbox. Xo sooner had she taken the\noath than she electrified the court by\nsaying:\n“I’lease, I want to speak the truth.”\nMy learned friend could not dis\nguise the astonishment with which he\nheard this strange desire. But the\njudge encouraged her kindly.\nShe had, she said, known all about\nit from the first, and hnd promised\nMargaret not to tell, but when she\nhad seen Mr. Rupert In the dock and\nhad noticed how near we got to the\ntruth she felt compelled to speak.\nThe prisoner\'s brother had been\nturned out by his father a month ago,\nbut had remained hiding in the neigh\nborhood. He had arranged, she said,\nto run away with Margaret. The diffi\nculty of money had presented itself.\nApparently this charming pair had\ndetermined to get over this in an easy\nif not original manner. When the\nfather had been summoned to town\non law business they planned and car\nried out the real burglary at the\nfarmhouse. The prisoner’s brother\nhad a key of his father\'s safe, and\naccording to his version was morally\nentitled to some of the money—he\nsaid £ 100. His father, displeased at\nhis conduct, refused to give it him.\nAccordingly he had entered the\nfarmhouse late at night, and with\nthe assistance of Margaret removed\nhis share, or what he claimed was his\nshare, of the family savings. He and\nMargaret w’ere to be married within\ntwo days, but something happened to\nprevent it. Mr. Rupert disappeared,\nand later Margaret made a startling\ndiscovery about him.\nHe had gone to his brother first,\nremonstrated with him, and then find\ning this useless, had used force.\nThere had been a struggle, Dick had\nbeen left senseless on the ground,\nand Rupert had taken from him the\nkey of the safe and the £ 100 note.\nThis Margaret learned late at night,\nand her mother-wit enabled her to\ndeduce the fact that Rupert would\nplace back the note before his fathei\nreturned on the morrow.\nTo accomplish this she knew that\nhe would probably imitate bis guilty\nbrother, and break in, and she con\nceived the cruel reTenge of waiting\nuntil he was in the house, and then\nmaking his mother surprise him in\nwhat was apparently an act of bur\nglary.\nTwo things more remain to be made\nclear. When my client fled on the\nappearance of his mother he acted\nfoolishly, but he had the shielding of\nbis brother, not himself, in mind.\nAs for that brother, it is fair to say\nthat had he not been lying sick and\nin delirium while the restorer of hi*\nhonor was awaiting trial, and during\nthat trial Itself, he would, I believe,\nhave come forward to speak the truth,\nAs it was, truth crept in without\nhim, as it has s of doing even ia\nthe most complicated case*,—Rea\nson\'s Weekly.\nTHE BARGE OFFICE.\nPlace Where Immigrants Must An\nswei Many Questions.\nSol All Win Come to Our Shore* Are\n"ernillled to U«l-\\l «rk of\nthe Commissioner of Im\nmigration.\n[Special New York Letter.]\n<7^1 GREAT crowd of people is\nyfcJl pushing against the rope that\n** ki has been stretched along the\nouter edge of the walk in front of the\nbarge oflice on the llatterj. Men and\nwomen are struggling with one an\nother in their endeavor to get to the\nfront. Four policemen parade up and\ndown the line, swinging little canea in\na vain at tempt to keep order.\nFrom the door of the building a\nstream of immigrants is pouring.\nGREETING HIS SON WITH A KISS.\nThere are men clad in clothing made\nof queer cloth and cut in quaint shapes.\nThere are women—mostly without\nhead covering—dressed in the pictur\nesque costumes of the far-away coun\ntries. Some are leading by the hands\nlittle children attired in miniature imi\ntation of old women and old men, and\nothers carry in their arms big bundles\nof shawls and rags, beneath the cor\nners of which p*er the shining eyes of\ninfants.\nThose coming down the steps have\nmet their relatives and their friends.\nThose without the rope are seeking\nthe loved ones who have come from be\nyond the sea. There is a wild jargon of\nvoices—a strange commingling of\nmany tongues. Just off the walk, up\ntoward the Rattery park, an old man\nin a long coat, a skull cap, with gray\nbeard and stooped shoulders has\nthrown his arms around his son and\nkissed him on the cheek. Not far from\nhere a young woman stands bewildered\nand alone, ller escort who had mother\non the borders of the strange land has\nleft her for a moment, and she has\nbeen surrounded by a horde of rapa\ncious expressmen. Within the build\ning. cldke to the identification desk, is a\ntall, lank Dutchman. On his head is an\nodd little Dutch cap. His trousers have\na hitch and his coat has a swing that\nbetrays his nationality. It has only\nbeen a few days since he discarded the\nwooden shoes of his fatherland and his\nbaggngebears about it the air of dykes\nand ditches. To each one of the at\ntendants who passes he says, in low\nDutch:, “Have you seen roy Jacob?\nTell me if you have seen my Jacob?”\nOut on the esplanade three\'I\'urks are\nmaking salams to an aged father.

And some\ncome with joy and some with sadness.\nIf you care to study the great foreign\npopulation of America, as it comes to\nus in the original form, you should\nspend one day with the commissioners\nof immigration. Last year 400,000 im\nmigrants came to this country—a pret\nty good indication of the rapidity with\nwhich the land of liberty is filling up.\nYou doubtless have seldom given heed\nto the care that must be exercised on\nEXPKESSMEN FIGHTING FOB PRUT.\ntha part of the government officials\nwho pass on the right of these people\nto come among us and make this land\ntheir own. When the gates have once\nbeen opened they are our people. Is it\na wonder, then, that they are closely\nscrutinized by the gatekeeprs? Last\nyear, in round numbers, 35,000 of the\nimmigrants were deported. They got\nno fnrther than the examination room\nof tne special board of inquiry, and\ntheir glimpse of the land which they\nhad hoped to inhabit extended only to\nthe trees in Battery park.\nLong years of practice have made the\nsystem of the coremissiocera almost\nperfect.

Th#\nmeals are furnished by a restaurateur\nlocated in the building, who pays the\ngovernment *6,000 a year for the con\ncession and furnishes a bond of like\namount as a guarantee thnt the food\nshall be pure and palatable. The ex\npense to the steamship company is 5<1\ncefits a day for e(tch immigrant de\ntained. If at the end of five days ne\none calls for the immigrant he is re\nturned to the country whence he came\nat the expense of the company that\nbrought him here.\nAlthough he ha* already passed th*\nstate quarantine, each immigrant si\nhe comes in his turn is closely examined\nby three doctors, and if he be found sick\nor in any wa}\' indisposed he is sent to\nthe medical department on Long Island\nand the steamship company which h*\npatronized is charged $1.50 a day until\nhe ia released.

Sometimes queer\nswers are brought out by these qu\ntions.

South Africa,\non August 1, a carreapendent in the\nfirst Canadian contingent give* the fol\nlowing rum a tv tie history of the failure\nof a Hoer plot to recapture Johannes\nburg which had a prospect of being suc\ncessful, says the New York Hun, until\nthe love of a Hoer maiden for a Briton\novercame her patriotism and saved the\nBritish garrison:\n"A couple of week* ago the Boera\nwithin and without Johannesburg ar\nranged for a rising t here by making all\nour ofllccra prisoners, snd then by at\ntacking the soldiers, who. It was ex\npected, would l»e demoralised and sur\nrender. Meetings were held by the\nBoer leaders at the Grand Natlonnl ho\ntel and all arrangements were made\nonce mote to place Johannesburg iu\nthe hand* of the burghers. On Satur\nday afternoon, July 14, a gymkhana\nhad been arranged for the officers, to\nbe held on the race-track, under the\npatronage of the military governor\nand major general commanding, for\ncharitnbie purpose*. It vvaa expected\nthat almost nil the oflicers uf the gar\nrison would he there. •\n“The Boera purposed attending Ihia\nmeeting armed with revolvers, and hav\ning a large number of confederates,\narmed likewise with Mausers, hiding\nIn buildings in the Immediate vicinity .\nof the racetrack, ready to act upon the\ngiven signal. It was planned that w hen\nthe oflicers had been made prisoners\nother Boer* in the city would concen\ntrate nt n point fixed upon nnd attack\nllie Britisli soldiers.\nWhile tins wu going on a large\nnumber of liners from the outside\nwould rush into the town and assist\ntheir countrymen. It was anticipated\nthat the soldiers would be utterly de\nmoralized by the absence of thrlr offi\ncers, uml with no one to direct them\nwould easily be overcome ami made\nprisoners. The whole plan was care\nfully ami secretly concocted, bo thnt the\nmilitary authorities were in entire ig\nnorance of the plot on the morning of\nthe dny for putting It into execution.\nThe totnl miscarriage of the ltoers\'\nhold nttrinpt was brought about by n\nwotnnn in a very simple and yet inter\nesting tale of love,\n"It nppenrs that a pretty Hoer maid\nen in Johannesburg had two lovers, on«\nan Kngllahnian and the other a burgh\ner. They were both very pressing for\nthe hand of this young girl. On tha\nmorning of the gymkhana day tlis\nIlocr lover visited her and urged an im\nmediate mnrrlnge thnt very morning,\nami for reason of such urgency, he\nunfolded the Hoer plot to seize Johan\nnesburg. As he was to take part in the\nstirring event of the dny, he was afraid\nthat possibly be would be killed or\nwounded, and consequently wished to\nmake t he young woman his wife. The\ngirl asked for two hours to consider the\nproposal, at the expiration of which\ntime lie was to return to her for his\nunswer.\n“As sunn ns t he Hoer lover was well\nout of sight the girl rushed to the mil\nitary governor and gave him all the in\nformal ion she had just received. It\ncan rendily be understood how such n\ntalc would startle that officer, and ha\nat once took action. On the young\nwonian\'a return home she was accom\npanied by\' some of the military police,\nwho followed a short distance behind,\nand when the Hoer lover returned for\nhis answer he was at once arrested and\ntaken before the military governor. On\nthe prisoner incriminating papers and\nletters were found which bore out ail\nthnt the young woman had told and a\ngreat deal more. A list of leaders was\ndiscovered among the papers secured,\nand other important information.\n“The governor acted promptly, can\ncelled the gymkhana, and had all the\nliners whose names uppeared on the\nlists arrested and at once sent to Cape\nTown. More than 500 Boers were made\nprisoners. A general search for arms\nwas ordered, and hundreds of Mansers\nwere found hidden under mattresses\nand in other places. There Is little\ndoubt but for the information given\nthe military governor by the Hoer\nmaiden the Hoers would have been\nguccesefnl in retaking Johannes\nburg. It Is only a fair presumption\nthat the young maiden’s tastes were\nfor her Knglish lover, who will, no\ndoubt, now run a winning race for the\nIMwsessinn of her hand, aa his compet\nitor ia out of it effectually.”\nThe Pioneer Sblrt-Walal Man.\n“I do lie ray din\' a deal in the paypers\nthese days aboot th’ sburrt-wayste\nman,” said Dan Keegan to his purtner,\nas they straightened themselves up\nfrom the ditch where tthey were at\nwork to stare at a party of golfers coin\ning down the lane. “These wirnmen\nare inakin’ altogether too much av a\nfuss aboot it.

The device shown In the illus\ntration is very satisfactory and can\nbe made at very little expense. It\nwould require about 70 feet of scant\nling 3Vs by 2 inches, two good pulleya\nand n strong piece of rope. The leg*\nare each 7 feet 3 inches long. At the\ntop are two frame*. The aide pieces\nof the upper one is 8 feet lgng and the\nlower 10 feet. At the joinings, the legs\nand side piece* should be mortised *4\nineli each firmly bolted with good\nstrong bolts. The two cross board*\nat the top arc each 5 by 1% inches and\n2\'/» feet long. They should be of some\nhard wood, ns they hold the pulleya\ninnd consequently bear the weight of\nthe hogs, braces can be put In if the\nframe doe* not seem strong enough.\ntJ w_,\nHANGER READY FOR UBE.\nThe sides should lean toward ench\nolhrr some, tlie legs being 2\'/j feet\napart at tlie top, anil 4% feet at the bot\ntom.\nT he roll\'-r is about 2% feet froih tbs\nground. The one in the Illustration\nwhs taken from an old binder, the iron\nrod In the center being squared at one\nend for the crank. Any blacksmith can\nmake a crank for it. It should be long\nenough to give good leverage in lift\ning the hogs. The pulleys are fastened\nto ttie boards at the top by means\nof eyebolt*. The rope Is fastened to\ntlie roller, passes through both pul\nleys, and has the gambrel tied to the\nother end. It should be long enough\nthat no lifting be required.\nWhen the hog Is ready to he hung,\nlift it until the gambrel comes above\nthe 10-foot side piece; turn the ling\nuntil the gambrel rests on these pieces\nat both side*, when the rope is untied\nand tlie hog is slipped to the end near\nthe roller. Care should be taken that\nthe gambrels are long and strong\nenough to bear the weight. Several\nhog* can be hung at one time in this\nway.\nAnother arrangement good for rainy\nday* is made by securing the roller at\nthe side of a shed, and chaining the\npulley to the rafter*. A long rope is\nrequired and the hogs are raised up\nand then lowered into n hogshead of\nhot water. After they are scalded and\ncleaned, the carcasses are raised and\nhung on two heavy scantlings which\nare fastened in the shed und used just\nns in ease of the other device. This\npermits nil work to be done under shel\nter, and doe* away with the heavy lift\ning on butchering day.—Orunge Judd\nFarmer.\nHINTS FOR SHEPHERDS.\nFeed the lambs.

In making this decision\nthe market he experts to supply is the\nmost important thing to consider. If\nhis market calls for poultry he should\nhelp to supply it by growing the kind\nof poultry making the most meat of\nthe best quality. If the demand is bet\nter for eggs he should keep the breed\nof poultry producing the most eggs\nduring the year. If a general market\nIs to be supplied, the farmer might\nkeep two breeds of poSHry. by giving\nthem the proper cure and in up CUM\nillouing ti-.e breed* to cross.\nRICH BURGLAR STOLE FOR FUH\nParis Millionaire for Elawaa Tears\nRobbed simple •• an Aaaase\n■rst.\nChicago detectives may aa well be\ngin to atudy the face and deeds of Au\ngust Fevrot, Paris man of fashion and\nexpert burglar, who has declared bis\nintention of coming to America to dc\na little professional work.\nTbs police of Paris claim that this\n(■me Mr. Fevrot is the priae catch of\nyears and they are correspondingly\nhappy.

But he loved\nexcitement, and he found it when by\nmistake he was taken in with a gang\nof young burglars nnd was permitted\nto accompany them on a raid. The raid\nwas a failure, but it was exciting, and\nfrom that time the young man was a\nburglar, nnd nil ex|>ert. lie showed\nhi* young companion* why they failed,\nand later on he led them against the\nsame safe oud they made a success\nful job.\nJ he young min i three years service\nIn the army prevented him from taking\nas active an Interest In burglary ns ht\nhad before, but he managed to keep ir\ntouch with his old friends In the pro\nfession and did much of their planning\nfor them.
