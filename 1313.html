Some crit\nicism of thé federal aid standards and\nthe cost of roads constructed on fed\ntime to time. In answer to these crit\nidsms, it might he statt*«! that with\nout federal aid only a narrow and\nmuch inferior road could have Iicen\nbuilt, and the cost thereof would hnv«>\nbeen considerably in excess of 50 per\ncent of the cost of the present con\nconstructed road. Therefore the fed\neral aid was of distinct advantage, lie\ncause It ennhl«*d the construction of\nmore mileage than could- otherwise\nhave been built, and tins mileage is\nmuch superior, both in gradient struc\ntures and finish.\n"It is unfortunate that additional\nstate funds could not have been made\navailable to cooperate With the fed\neral government in tlie construction\nof the «incomplete«! twenty-three\nmiles. However, the plans for tlie\nimprovement of the uncompleted por\ntion, which were formulated in the\nspring of 1023! and which will be put\ninto «\'ffect this fall, will undoubtedly\n.result in placing tills section of the\nhighway In such a condition as to\nmake It throughout its entire length\nnot only reasonably passable, but safe\nand comfortable to travel.
