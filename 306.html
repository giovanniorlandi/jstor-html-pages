On thefarthersideof the\nstream was a tract of open country\ndotted with clumps of tret and un\ndtiwood and bright. with heather.\nThe stepping-stones were half cot\nered with water to-day; the current\nwas running fureer than its wont.\nShe bethought herself of a rustic\nbridge a few yards farther dt n.\nThe bridge hung high in the air.\nsupported by rough pinestem.";it was\npicturesque-, but a fragile affair. Half\nway across Irma put her hand on the\nrail how noisy the stream was! it\n.-napped off at her touch; one wooden\nplank tottered under her feet, another\nfell with a splash into the water be\nlow. She had plenty of courage; she\nwas light and active. She knew, more\nover, that she could easily knap that\nformidable-looking gap and gain the\nbank. She was about to make the at\ntempt when she wesetopped by a per\nemptory shout.\n"Gently, gently! Jump from that\nprojecting stem; it is safe!"\nShe looked up; on the edge of the\nheather-covered rock btood Albrecht\nKeitzenberg.\nShe paused uncertain, half inclined\nto retrace her step.

Albrecht held her\nhands clasped in his.\n"Thank heaven that you are sufe!"\nhe cried. "Oh! lnna. my lnna, I\ncould not stop yon. I came just too\nhite for that. I could only look on in\nagony. Are you frightened? Are ymi\nhurt?"\n"I am not hurt.

Four hundred years of gradual\nprocess have elapsed, and what are they? A caged being, worse than\nhis forefather ever dreamt of. Idler, beggar, gambler, pauper and\nruin !

To Christianize the Indians we must seclude\nthem by themselves, away from the vices of civilization, and send\nmissionaries to them."

"Build more schools on reserva\ntions, so that the Indian pupils may be an object lesson for their\nparents, to convince them of the practicability of education."\nWith a shake of my head I would say, very few Indian schools\nare needed in the United States. Or, I might go so far as to say, no\nIndian school is necessary, especially when the public school is the\nAnchor of our educational system. To mc to deprive the Indian chil\ndren of this anchorage is an insult. You may as well say: "You\nare an inferior race of children; we do not want you in our public\nschools." In Indian schools Indians teach Indians. When you al\nlow their ignorant parents to decide for their children\'s welfare, you\nonly encourage the blind to lead the blind, and Indians will remain\nIndians for ages to come. My plea is, if the public school is good\nenough for all races, who not for the true American children.\nTHE SHOW MAN AND THE ANTHROPOLOGIST.\n"Leave the Indians alone. It is beautiful to preserve the true, chil\ndren of nature as object lessons to study from." By blinding the In\ndians Buffalo Bill has wrongly educated the public. To leave the\nIndians alone as curiosities and studies may be well enough for the\nshow man and the anthropologist. But what about the Indian ? The\nstandard of a splendid race-is degraded by it. He deserves a bet\nter fate than to be decked with savage attire, only to be ridiculed and\njeered at for mercenary and scientific purposes. Do away with your\nignorance of the Indian. Help him to escape the deadly fate of the\nreservation system. Learn of him, as he will of you.

There is no telling how many Chinese there are\nin our far west. The census is entirely unreliable on that point, sim\nply because the Chinese hide and skulk and evade enumeration and\nidentification as much as possible. There are over 50,000 of them in\nSan Francisco alone, and they swarm all over the Pacific and moun\ntain states. They have practically monopolized the labor field in the\nAlaska fisheries, and in the Pacific states they have driven to the wall\nour American working men and women in the lines of household serv\nice, cigar making, boot and shoe making, bag making, tailoring, laun\ndering, farming, brick making, mine working and railroad working,\nnot to speak of many other industries.\nBut I need not tell over again this old familiar tale of how our\nhonest, brave American working men and women on the frontier\nhave been wounded thus in the house of their friends. The work\ningmen of the United States the backbone of this country stand\nas a unit, shoulder to shoulder, on this question. They may differ\nas to other questions, but they are unanimous in their appreciation of\nthis one great overshadowing peril and menace.\nALMOND CULTURE.\nThe Story of It Successful Introduction\nin California.\nIn the old Roman days nuts were\nnot only part of every dessert, but\nthey served also as playthings . for\nchildren. From thie- latter use a cu\nrious custom w as evolved in the Eo\nman marriage cermony. The bride\ngroom, as he led his bride to her fu\nture home, threw nuts to the gaping\ncrowd, to symbolize that he thus cast\naside all his boyish sports. From\nthese Romans has descended to us\nthe thought that nuts signify pleas\nure; and most of us to-day consider\nthem the trifles that give excuse for\nremaining at the table when wit takes\nits airiest flights. As a people we\nspend a large hidi annually for nuts,\nas mere delicacies, either in their orig\ninal form or as disguised by the con\nfectioner\'s skill. On the other hand,\nan increasingly large number of our\ncitizens are adopting the nut as a sub\nstantial portion of the meal, as a sub\nstitute, in part or in whole, for flesh\nfoods.\nWith the increased consumption of\nnuU, attention hasi been, turned to\ntheir production. Thealmond, alien\nthat it is, has been experimented with\nin various parts of the Union. It\nUBed to be asserted that the almond\nwould thrive w herever the peach did,\nso, nearly 50 years ago, the commis\nsioner of patents obtained a quantity\nof almond seedlings and buds from\nabroad and distributed them through\nout the southern and middle states.\nThe trees grew and bloomed profuse\nly, but did not fruit. The experiment\nwas repeated in California, with al\nmost an equal failure, and it was be\nginning to be accepted as a fact that\nalmonds could not be raised in the\nUnited States. Then Mr. A. T.\nHatch, who owned a ranch near\nSuisun, Cal., threw his energy into\nthe industry, says Country Life in\nAmerica. He found that seedlings\nproduced in Calif orniamatured fruits\nwhen the imported ones failed; and\nthat not only did UI8 nuts differ from\nthe foreign almond, but they varied\naccording to the locality in which the\nseedling was raised. From among\nUNCLE SAM "I THINK I\'VE DESIGNED A BUNCH OF TROUBLE\nFOR MYSELF I \'\nNO. 11.\nbe increased, urges that Chines\'\nuiuur m uu liu iii in, uej uui lis\nten to him for a moment, but push\nhim aside and tell him you stand\nfor that great mass of American\ncitizer.vy.ho jire earnestly striving\nto uplioW\'raridard for the\nAmerican vv-jHearner, an( \'(Jf\nhis cottage. htu;ie.Jor good cloth\n& r t Hi tf J A T"S 11\nfnafthis the greatest fiitiok\n192 varieties that he created f our wtTe\nchosen to be developed further at\nstaple products. By forming part\nnerships with a number of farmers,\nhe was able to test the effect of differ\nent climatic conditions. It was\nlearned that almonds mature in 1\nwarm climate, dry in summer. The\nmore moisture they can have in grow\ning time the plumper the nut, but\nthey require dryness when ripening.\nThese requirements exclude from al\nmond cultureparta of California\nwhere the trees were first started. Al\nthough California has paid more at\ntention to the almond than has any\nother state, Arizona, New Mexico,and\nTexas, also, have localities with\nclimate adapted to this nut, and they\nhave entered into its culture to a small\nextent. The almond industry in the\nUnited States is yet in its infancy;\nand, if it continues to grow as it has\nin the past decade, we may hope not\nonly to cease importations, but, with\nin the first quarter of the century, to\nbegin exportation, both in its natur\nal state and in all tho oils, "health\nfoods," and cosmetics that art is\ncapable of evolving.\nHEDGEHOG AND VIPER.\nA Pecular Duel in Which tho Snake was\nDisastrously Defeated.\nA resident of Versailles, M.

Perfect\n11 He .Made.\nI\'lruse tiul u it tun a drawing of my\nimproved poultry fcetlinsr box, which\nha many points of importance. A\nbtx ul thia kind is made very cheaply;\nit is eay to keep clean, and at the\ntame time kef p? the birds from getting\ninto and soiling the food. At the tame\ntime each hen cuunot push away her\nneighbor in eating a meal, so that the\ndifferent ones can have a fair share of\nthe hot mush at the morning meal. To\nconstruct a feed box of this kind, all\none needs is a board ten or twelve\ninches wide, one inch or more thick and\nfour feet Ions:: six or seven plastering\nlaths and a handful of wire shingle\nn.iils, which are to be driven through\nthe top ends of the laths and clinched.\nIt is wi ll not to have the upper sides of\nIMPROVED FEEDING BOX\nthe frame, where the feed is put in,\nmore than three or fmir inches, so\nthat a lien cannot pet in. The openings\nat the sides I have about three inches\nbetween the laths.\nI have used and have seen a larpe\nvariety of box feeders and 1 find that\nthis plan is about as near perfect as\nanything in use. I must not omit to\nsay that in putting 011 the upright\nlaths it is well to let them into the side\nof the four foot board, as a box made\nin this manner will lust for years with\nproper care. t is not easily tipped\nover, and will hold grain or mush food\nby letting the laths come up an inch\nabove the bottom board. Charles E.\nRussell, in X. Y. Tribune.\nEFFECTS OF CROSSING.\nWhere Poultry Raisers Practlee It\nl.rraelr. the Result Is early Al\nways a Failure.\nCrossing the breeds has never given\ngood results, although a great many\ntry It, and will continue to do so. In\nnearly all cases when the attempt is\nmade to blend the best qualities of two\ndifferent breeds the offspring is not\nequal to either parent, hence in the\ncourse of a few years there will be no\nuniformity, and the stock reverts to\nthe scrub. Too much mixing is no bet\nter than keeping scrubs. It is right\nand proper to grade up a common flock\nwith pure breeds, but to cross two pure\nbreeds is a mistake. Where crossing is\npracticed largely, as with poultry, the\nresult is nearly always a failure, there\nbeing no uniformity of color, size or\nlaying finalities. Pure breeds are real\nly thi; results of judicious crossings\nand selections, nnd cannot be improved\nupon except after years of care and se\nlection of the best individuals. The\nbest possible security, short of the\nactual test, that any bird or animal\nwill produce its characteristics in its\noffspring is that these characteristics\nare known to have belonged to a long\nline of ancestors. Individual merit\nnnd adaptation to our needs should be\nthe first and most important points of\nselection. The character of the ances\ntors should be considered. It is not\nnecessary to endeavor to determine the\ncharacter of any one of the ancestors,\nfor when pure breeds are used one gets\nat once the results of selection for\nye ars by those who worked in the past.\nCrossing destroys the work that others\nhave done before. Farm and Fireside.\nSPRING POULTRY NOTES.\nThe sitting hen should hnve a daily\ndust bath.\nKeep the hen-hatched chicks dry\nand warm.\nlie sure that your poultry bus com\nfortable quarters.\nDucks and geese should never be\nkept with chickens.\nEarly pullets are the profitable\nwinter egg chickens.\nYoung ducks should have an abun\ndance of coarse sand.\nThe hen nnd her chicks should be\nprotected from the wind.\nIf an old rooster is not fit for the\ntable, kill him and bury him.\nHens will lay as well without the\nattention of the male as with it.\nFilthy quarters produce sickness,\nand sick hens will not produce eggs.\nIt has been proven by experiment\n4Iiat it pays better to feed milk to\nchickens than to pigs. Commercial\nPoultry.\nC lean Nests Are Seceasary,\nThe liens prefer clean nests, and\nwhen they refuse to lay in the poul\ntry-house, and begin to deposit their\neggs in the hay-loft, in the food\ntroughs, or away in the fields, the\nchances are that lice have taken pos\nsession of the nests and driven the\nhens away. A single broken egg in\nthe nest will soon cause millions of\nlice, and once they . secure a foot\nhold they stick closely until they\nare driven off by heroic treatment\nKeep the nests clean, and always\nhave tobacco dust, or earth sat\nurated with carbolic ..acid, convenient\nfor scattering in the nests when\ncleaning them. Farm and Fireside.\nDo \'ot Crowd the Chicks.\nCrowding is bad in any stage of a\nfowl\'s existence. Perhaps it is worse\nin the case of young chicks, whose\nhold on life is very light at the\nitart. The brood that is watched\nover by the old hen seldom is crowd\ned enough to be injured. Xot so the\nbrooder chicks. The amateur that\nhas a few incubators is very likely\nto try to save space in the brooder,\njr rather, to make one brooder do\nthe work of several. When too many\nare brought together disease germs\n-lave a good chance to multiply in the\nrapidly accumulating filth. Bad air\nilso helps Blotters along.

The queen cells\nare quite different from all other cells\nin the hive. They are built on the out\nedges of the combs, or in uneven places\n011 the surface. In beginning t hem the\nbees build a heavier base about them\nthan other cells, anil in cup shape, ainl\nwith walls less than an eighth of an\ninch deep. Thev are thus ready for the\nqueen to deposit eggs in, and ordinarily\nthere are from ten to a doen and iu\nsome cases more in colon v.\nAfter the eggs are deposited in these\ncells we mav know that the bees are\npreparing to swarm, and in eignt or\nnine days will come off, if the weather\nwill permit them, or on the first line\nday thereafter. At this time these\ncells will be built out full si.c, from\nthree-fourths to one inch long. At thi\nage the cells are sealed over, which is\nalways an indication thi\'t the swanu is\ndue to come off, and if not already\nswi.rmcd, the weather perhaps has\nheld them back, but they will come oil\nthe first fine day.\nThis applies t first swarms.

II11III on Ilia\nllot-Honse Principle, with ta\npneits- of 1 1, sou l;im.\nAccording to a Sydney paper, Aus\ntralia has the largest duck ranch in\nthe world, and has just completed, w ilu\nmost excellent success, the largest in\ncubator in the world. The incubator\nhas a capacity of 1i,lfi duck eggs, or\n14,101) hen eggs. The machine is built\non the hot-house principle, and. in fa V.\nis a hot-house. Jt stands in the open\nand is constructed of ordinary pine\nweather boards, with corrugated iron\nroof. The egg trays each hold bill dm k\nor K)0 ben eggs, and there are four of\nthese end to end in 11 tiers, one above\nthe other on each side of the room,\nmaking a total of &8. Moisture is sup\nplied in pans beneath the bottom tier\nof trays. The heat is supplied by\nmeans of steam pipes from the boiler,\nwhich is kept constantly going to fur\nnish motive power for the various\nworks in conenction with the estab\nlishment. The incubator is said to be\nworking well and bringing out n large\npercentage of ducks. This season tho\nmachine has brought from 10 to ,\'0 per\ncent, nnd the proprietor has about\n5,000 ducklings. The incubator will be\nwatched with much interest by the\nAmerican incubator men. Journal of\nAgriculture.\nAdvantaices of Tray- -Vesta.\nNot the least among the advan\ntages of this invention is the being\nable to determine the laying period\nof the hens. A fowl that begins to\nlay in November and produces her\neggs during the period when eggs\nare high in price is far more valu\nable than a fowl that begins to lay\non the first of February and drops\nmost of her eggs in the spring nnd\nearly summer, when eggs are bein\ndisposed of at a very low price. The\nphenomenal winter layer, unless dis\ncovered by the trap nest, stands a\ngood chance of having her head cut\noff at the end of the laying season,\nwhen, in fact, she should be kept as\na breeder. The trap nest makes it\npossible for the breeder to become\npersonally well acquainted with each\nmember of his flock. Farmers\' lie-\nSalt Make, liar Palatable.\nSalt scattered over hay when put into\nthe mow makes it more palatable ami\ndigestible. Salt and lime thus sown\nover the hay as mowed prevents fer\nmentation, molds, mildews and loss of\npalatability. Lamj hay mowed with\nlayers of straw prevents the injury of\nhay; at the same time it adds aroma\nand quality to the Btraw, rendering it\nmore appetizing and digestible.
