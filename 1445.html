It purposes to make col\nored people the best possible citizens\nthat can be made. In all our work\nwe try to see both sides, always in\nviting the co-operation of the white\npeople.\n“It is my belief that ‘Jim Crow\'\npeople make ‘Jim Crow’ conditions.\nTherefore new migrants are a prob\nlem. I believe that the league is\nneeded here or anywhere where such\na problem of adjustment arises.”\nCitizens Must Finance\nA brief sketch of the types of work\nthe league was doing in the 40 com\nmunities where it is located was given\nby the speaker. In concluding, Mr.\nHill said that the National office\n-would be willing to spend up to\nSSOO in order to actually establish the\nbranch in an office here. This amount\nwould include the expense of a pre\nliminary investigation such as has\nalready been made, and the expense\nof an organizer who would be on the\nground perhaps ten days.

Hamilton, expressed the\nbelief Sunday in a speech at the\nSt. Paul baptist church that a new\nleadership which would receivfe its\nappointment from the masses and\nexecute the will of the masses was\nin the process of formation.\n“The reason there is so much cri\nticism of so-called ‘Negro’ leaders\ntoday is that they do not lead, they\nare not doing what the people want\ndone. Rather do you find the self\nmade leaders seeking by means of\ngreat publicity bureaus to ram their\ndoctrines down the throats of the\nmass of citizens and the ’hand-pick\ned’ ones preaching the doctrine that\nthe white man tells them to preach,”\nsaid Mr. Hamilton -said.\nThe evolution of leadership was\ntraced briefly by the speaker who\nshowed that at first, leaders arose\nbecause of their physicial prowess,\nand latter! strategy and diplomacy\nmade kings and rulers. He pointed\nout that the French and American\nrevolutions were nothing more than\nthe throwing off of leadership that\nwas self-imposed rather than of the\npeople.\n“Colored Americans will do well\nto take lessons from these two great\nevents,” Mr. Hamilton aaiid. “Just\nafter freedom, men arose and became\nleaders because they were more\nintelligent than the great ignorant\nmass. They fulfilled their task.\nToday the masses are in a great\nmeasure able to say what they want\ndone. There is no longer room for\neither the self-styled, soap box type,\nor the “white fofks leader.” The\nmen that lead today and-, tomorrow\nmust stand squarely on a platform\ninitiated by the people themselves.”\nThe proposal of an all-race con\nference was heartily endorsed by the\nspeaker who said that it was the first\nattempt that has ever been made\nto get every shade of opinion to\ngether on the race problem.\nST. PAUL BAPTIST CHURCH\nServices were well attended last\nSunday. Interest in the rally is in\ncreasing. The pastor married Lloyd\nHogan and Katherine Jackson on\nTuesday.

Scott, of Howard Uni\nversity, sent the following telegram to\nthe Honorable Elbert H. Gary, chair\nman of the Board of Directors of the\nUnited States Steel Corporation:\nHon. Elbert H. Gary,\nChairman Board of Directors,\nUnited States Steel Corporation,\nHoboken, N. J.\nI have read with interest your\nstatement reported in the Associated\nPress Dispatches this morning de\nploring alleged shortages of labor\n“due principally to present immigra\ntion laws.” You are reported to\nhave said that there is a great abun\ndance of labor on the other side of the\nworld that would be glad to come\nhere and develop our American re\nsoures.” May I venture to say that\nthere are in this country today twelve\nmillion colored people. Eight mil\nlion of these 12,000,000 are in the\nSouth. They are tied to a one\ncrop system and oppressed by econo\nmic that hinder. and prevent their\nfullest development and the enjoyment\nof the fullest American citizenship\nThey posses strong bodies and have a\nreal patriotic attachment to American\ninstitutions. They are in position to\nsupply the labor shortage to which you\nrefer if plans are undertaken on a\nlarge and important scale to transfer\nthem to centers where their services\nure needed. It seems unnecessary to\nlook to foreign shores to supply any\nlabor shortage that may exist in\nAmerican industries when there is this\nlarge and sympathetic group within\nreach. These Colored Americans are\nnot Aliens, they have never sought to\ndisrupt the Government nor do they\nharbor Bolshevistic or Anarchistic\nideals. They are ready and willing\nto help develop the resoures of their\ncountry. Will it not be possible for\none circumstanced as you are to lend\nthe weight of your great influence in\nopenine larger economic opportunities\nfor this group who are struggling un\nder adverse conditions in the rural\ndistricts of the far South where\nlynching and peonage are practiced\nupon them with impunity.\nYour support of such a movement\nwill be greatly appreciated.\nSigned, Emmet J. Scott.\nTo Restore War Insurance\nIt will be news to many World\nWar veterans to learn that the U.

The story is given in a\nletter written by the man, Elliott\nCulbreath, as follows:\nAsleep In Bed\n“My trouble arrived on the 4th\nSaturday night in November , 1920.\nI was in my bed asleep and a mob of\ncame to my house and\nstarted shooting and why they did\nthat I don’t know. They never seen\nsaid hello or anything and they broke\nthe back door open. My wife and\nchildren were taken, both—and my\nwife and children began screaming\nand yelling and my wife was holding\nthe front door and one of the children.\nOne woke me up. They were shoot\ning in the house and I asked them,\nwhat the mater was and they said to\nme, there is a crowd out there after\nyou. I ran to the back door and they\nshot at me and I ran behind the bed\nand got my pistol and I shot 2 (shots)\nbut of the door. But I did not hit\nanybody. When they stopped shoot\ning they ran to the woods and stayed\nthere a quarter of an hour and I\nheard them coming back.\nSearched Alley\n“They called my wife and asked\nher, hadn’t they killed me and she\ntold them, no; he has just left here\nand they went behind the house and\nlooked in the alley. And they found\none of their men dead and they said,\nI thought that I had killed the nigger;\nI shot the wrong man. My wife told\nthe next morning (what had been\nsaid) and they beat her and put her\nin jail and kept her there three\nmonths. They told her if she told\nwhat they said, they would kill her.\n“That morning they run them all\naway from home and beat them all\nand the little baby was crying for\nbread and they knocked a hole in my\nbaby’s head with a pistol. They stay\ned there and ate my food for two\nweeks. They left their automobile\nand slept there. They got there at\nII o’clock at night. If they had call\ned me I would have gone anywhere\nthey wanted me to. Because I never\ndone anything to anybody. My pistol\nwas a 32 (calibre) and the man was\nkilled with a 38. You see that there#\nwas no way for me to kill that man\nand the paper stated that he was kill\ned with a 38 calibre. They came\nover heTe“ to the state penitentiary\nthree times trying to make me tell\nthem who done the killing. Thev are\nnow punishing me for it and know\nthey punish me for what one of their\nown men done. They said I shot\nhim through the crack and there is no\ncrack in my house. I asked the lawy\ner to go to my house and look because\nthere is no crack in my house.\n“They whipped all the colored people\nso that they all are scared to do any\nthing to help me. I had about 300\nacres of land and I only tended to\na 3 horse farm for myself and I work\ned a 5 horse farm for the white\nfolks and let the best of my land lay\nout.

This\ntotal reduction from the purchase\nprice of $13,000 has been accomplished\nin slightly more than two years.\nThe building or buying of any\nchurch should be an occasion for gen\neral acclaim, for the church, wheai\nproperly administered, is* one of the\nmost vital factors in the well-being\nof the community; but when a hand\nful of people sacrifice and give of\nthemselves and their worldly goods\nas has the congregation of Camphor\nchurch then praise is richly deserved.\nThe feat deserves mention first be\ncause it means that a church is grad\nually coming to minister in a field\nhardly touched. The most significant\nthing about the accomplishment of\nthis congregation, however, is that it\nhas demonstrated that digging down,\nsacrificing and giving is a surer way\nto progress than sitting back waiting\nfor others to do or begging for help.\nNo church of our race here or else\nwhere can rise very high in its own\nestimation or secure the respect of\nothers until it demonstrates that it is\nwilling to work and help itself to\ngreater life. May Camphor go on,\nand may others follow her example.\nNo better way of combating the\never-present and often groundless sus\npicion that the railroads are the worst\nof the country’s corporations could be\ndevised than the series of signed talks\nnow being published by one of the\nnorthwest’s great transcontinental\nsystems.\nThe surest way to mitigate distrust\nand suspicion is to pave the way to\nan understanding of mutual problems.\nThis these talks are doing. If the\nurban dweller can be brought to rea\nlize something of the problems of the\nfarmer, if both can be shown the im\nportance of the railroad in the solu\ntion of the economic ills of the nation\nthen there is hope for normalcy. If,\ntoo, the talks can bring about good\nwill and co-operation from the public\nthey will be more than worth while.\nDOUGLASS COMMUNITY CENTER\n(Southern Norkman)\nIn February of 1920 there was in\ncorporated in Toledo, Ohio, the\nFrederick Douglas Recreation Center\npurpose was *“to establish a\nrecreation center for colored boys\nand young men, and to provide a\nplace for the moral, mental, and\nphysical development of colored\nyouth.”\nAt the outset some SI2OO was rais\ned among the colored citizens to ini\ntiate the work of the Center. Toledo’s\nphilanthropies are combined in the\nToledo Community Chest, which raises\nfunds in a central drive once each\nyear and which aims to pay the actual\nrunning expenses of the thirty-six\nagencies that it recognizes. In April\n1920 the Chest investigated the Fred\nerick Douglass Recreation Center and\nallotted $2400 for its year’s work.\nIn 1921 the Center received S3OOO as\nits share. In 1922, convinced that\nthe organization was putting over a\nworth-while program, the officials of\nthe Chest raised the allotment to\nS7OOO.\nThe Frederick Douglas Commu\nnity Center in its three years of ac\ntual work has accomplished some\nthing. It has given the boys and\ngirls a place for supervised play and\norganized work with groups and in\ndividuals; and it has developed a\ncommunity consciousness among men\nand women of color. This institution\nis seeking to pave the way for a nevi\ntype of social work among colored\ngroups. Already the Center has out\ngrown its present quarters and is\nplanning to ask the citizens of Toledo\nin the near future to give it the\nmeans with which to build a fully\nequipped community center building.\nMOB PSYCHOLOGY\n(Minnesota Daily Star)\nThe mob at Calumbia, Mo., that\nhung a Negro charged with *an at\ntempted crime, in spite of the pleas\nof the father of the intended girl vic\ntim to let the law take its course,\nGOOD-WILL\nwas like all mobs. It was an unreas\noning, insatiable monster demanding\nblood.\nHad the lynching been for an ac\ntual and not an attempted crime, and\nhad noTthe representative of law and\nreason been the father of the injured\ngirl, the case against mob psychology\nwould not have been so clear. Under\nthe circumstances there is room for\nbelieving that the mob completed its\nwork because of an ungovernable de\nsire to whet its appetites.\nMob psychology is the human being\nat his worst. The Columbia citizens\nhave probably led fairly exemplary\nlives, or we would have heard of them\nbefore. The attempted crime aroused\nthem to a high pitch of passion. Con\ngregation into a group of severaF\nthousand lifted this passion into in\nsanity. At this stage the individual\nis submerged in the herd. Mora|> re\nsponsibility ceases. Screened by the\nmass, his lusts and passions attain\nabnormal development. The mob is a\nreversion to the cowardice and feroci\nty of the wolf pack.\nMob psychology has attained unu\nsual development in America. It has\nbecome a positive menace. National\nsecurity demands that we begin to ap\nply to it methods of scientific investi\ngation and treatment to the extent\nthat we would apply them to pneu\nmonia, spinal meningitis or cancer.\nj Health Talks j\nSOMETHING EVERY WOMAN\nSHOULD KNOW\n(Continued)\nAny questions regarding sub\njects in these articles or other\ndental work should be addressed\nto the Health Editor of the Ap\npeal. Dr. Weber will publish the\nanswers each week in this column.\nBy E. S. WEBER, D. D. S.\nI am continuing this subject because\nI feel that it is one of much import\nance- I „have had many questions\nasked me by women W\'ho were under\ngoing the period of gestation and I\nhave had them come to me for relief\nfrom dental troubles at times when it\nis rather dangerous to work. Hence\nI feel that the gentle sex should know\nsomething about this matter.\nIn myjast article I tried to make\nmanifest the importance of caring for\nthe teeth after conception takes place.\nI also told you when, and when not\nto, have this work done. In this\narticle let me tell you a little more\nabout the prenatal child itself.\nBefore going on with the subject\nI wish to state that I hope that my\narticles on this pai’ticular subject will\nbe taken in the proper spirit. Ignor\nance about important matters in the\npast years .have caused unneccessary\nsuffering, and I feel that the Medical\nProfession and its branches should in\nform the laity about these significant\nmatters. There is only one way we\ncan reach the masses and that is thru\nthe press and by lectures. I am\nusing both methods. If there is any\nclub \'or organization that would like\na lecture on any dental subject I will\ngladly come at your request.\nNow we will go on with the subject.\nYou must remember that you are\nactually building a foundation for the\nchild to build up on during post-natal\nactivity. Every mother will certainly\nsee to it that the child is properly\ncared for during post-natal life. Why\nnot do the same during pre-natal\nlife? How can you do this? After\nyour mouth has been put in a good\ncondition arrange your diet. I told\nyou in my last article that tlje pre\nnatal chili depends updi you for\nsustenance and life hence your diet\nwill play an important part in the\nhealth and vigor of your child after\nbirth.\nDo not get the idea that because\nyou are giving part of your nourish\nment for the benefit of your expect\nant child that you have to stuff\nself in order to have enough for both\nof you. This is a mistake which\ncauses a great deal of distress in the\nform of heartburn and indigestion.\'\nYou increase your food intake as\ngestation advances because the foetus\nrapidly grows in size and consequent\nly reqrfires more support from the\nmother.\nThe food taken cannot be too plain\nand it should be both light and nouri\nshing. A lady who is enciente may\ndepend upon it that the less stimu\nlents she takes at these times the bet\nter it will be for both herself and her\ninfant; the more kind will be her\nlabor and her recovery, and the more\nvigorous and healthy will be her child.\nHighly seasoned dishes should be\navoided. Baked apples, ripe pears,\nberries, grapes, tamarinds, figs, rai\nsins, stewed rhubarb, stewed or baked\npears, stewed prunes and oranges are\nparticularly beneficial; they quench\nthe thirst, open the bowels, ana they\nalso help make parturition easy and\npainless. Eat of the vegetables and\nan occasional piece of fish, foul, or\nmeat.\nIf a strict diet is followed you will\nfind that both the mother and infant\nwill have health and vigor in abun\ndance.

What\nsurprised her was the fact that,\nthough she and Florence had seemed\nto be riding quite awhile, they had\napparently not drawn any closer to\nthe round-up.

A roar of tramping\nhoofs filled her ears. The lines of\nmarching cattle had merged into a\ngreat, moving herd half obscured by\ndust. v ?\nThe bawling and bellowing, the\ncrackling of horns and pounding of\nhoofs, the dusty whirl of cattle, and\nthe flying cowboys disconcerted Made\nline and frightened her a little.\n“Look, Miss Hammond, there’s Don\nCarlos P* said Florence. “Look at that\nblack horse!”\nMadeline saw a dark-faced Mexican\nriding by. He was too far away for\nher to distinguish his features, but he\nreminded her of an Italian brigand.\nHe bestrode a magnificent horse.\nStillwell rode up to the girls then\nand greeted them in his big voice.\n“Right in the thick of it, hey? Wal,\nthet’s sure fine,- I’m glad to see, Miss\nMajesty, thet you ain’t afraid of a\nlittle dust or smell of bumin’ hide an’\nhair.”\nMadeline’s brother joined the group,\nevidently in search of Stillwell. “Bill,\nNels just rode in,” he said.\n“Good! Any news of Danny Mains?”\n“No. Nels said he lost the trail\nwhen he got on hard ground.”\n“Wal, wal. Say, Al, your sister is\nsure takin’ to the round-up. An’ the\nboys are gettin’ wise. See thet sun\nof-a-gun Ambrose cuttin’ capers all\naround. He’ll sure do his prettiest.\nAmbrose is a ladies’ man, he thinks.”\nThe two men and Florence joined\nin a little pleasant teasing of Made\nline, and drew her attention to what\nappeared to be really unnecessary feats\nof horsemanship all made In her vi\ncinity. The cowboys evinced their in\nterest in covert glances while recoiling\na lasso or while passing to and fro.\nIt was all too serious for Madeline to\nbe amused at that moment. She did\nnot care to talk. She sat her horse\nand watched.\nFor a week the scene of the round*\nup lay within riding-distance of the\nranch-house, and Madeline passed most\nof this tim£ In the saddle, watching\nthe strenuous labors of the vaqueros\nand cowboys. She overestimated her\nstrength, and more than once had to\nbe lifted from her horse. Stillwell\'s\npleasure in her attendance gave place\nto concern. He tried to persuade her\nto stay away from _the round-up, and\nFlorence grew even more solicitous.\nMadeline, however, was not moved\nby their entreaties.\nShe grasped only dimly the truth\nof what it was she was learning—\nsomething Infinitely more than the\nrounding up of cattle by cowboys, and\nshe was loath to lose an hour of her\nopportunity.\nBefore the week was out, however,\nAlfred found occasion to tell her that\nIt would be wiser for her to let the\nround-up go without gracing It further\nwith her presence. He said It laugh\ningly; nevertheless, he was serious.\nAnd when Madeline turned to him In\nsurprise he said, bluntly: +\n“I don’t like the way Don Carlos\nfollows you around. Bill\'s afraid that\nNels or Ambrose or one of the cow\nboys will take a fall out of the Mexi\ncan. They’re Itching the chance.\nOf course, dear, it’s absurd to you, but\nit’s true.”\nAbsurd it certainly was, yet it served\nto show Madeline how intensely, occu\npied she had been with her own feel\nings, roused by the tumult and toil of\nthe round-up.\' She recalled that Don\nCarlos had been presented to her, and\nthat she had not liked his dark, strik\ning face with its bold, prominent, glit\ntering eyes and sinister lines; and she\nhad not liked his suave, sweet, insin\nuating voice or his subtle manner, with\nits slow bows and gestures.\n“Don Carlos has been after Flor\nence for a long time,” said Alfred.\nCONGRESSMAN DYER TO\nSPEA£ HERE MAY 25\nThe condition of the colored people\nin the South, the activities of the Ku\nKluk Klan and the Dyer bill are some\nof the topics to be discussed by Rep\nresentative Leonidas C.

Now,\nmy dear, beautiful sister from New\nYork, I haven’t much use for Don Car\nlos ; but I don’t want Nels or Ambrose\nto make a wild throw with a rope and\npull the Don off his horse. So you had\nbetter ride up to the house and stay\nthere."\n“Alfred, yon are joking, teasing me,"\nsaid Madeline.\n“Indeed not,” replied Alfred. “How\nabout it, Flo?"\nFlorence replied that the cowboys\nwould upon the slightest provocation\ntreat Dot Carlos with less ceremony\naqd gentleness than a roped steer. Old\nBill Stillwell came up to be Importuned\nby Alfred regarding the conduct of\ncowboys on occasion, and he not only\ncorroborated the assertion, but added\nemphasis and evidence of his own.\n“An’, Miss Majesty,” he concluded,\n“I reckon if Gene Stewart was ridin*\nfer me, thet grinnln\' Greaser would\nhev hed a bump In the dust before\nnow.”\nMadeline had been wavering between\nsobriety and laughter until Stillwell\'s\nmention of his ideal of cowboy chiv\nalry decided in favor of the laughter.\n“I am not convinced, but I surren\nder,” she said. “You have only some\noccult motive for driving me away. I\nam sure that handsome Don Carlos is\nbeing unjustly suspected. But as I\nhave seen a little of cowboys’ singular\nimagination and gallantry, I am rather\nInclined to fear their possibilities. So\ngood-by.”\nThen she rode with Florence up the\nlong, gray slope to the ranch-house.\nThat night she suffered from excessive\nweariness, which she attributed more\nto the strange working of her mind\nthan to riding and sitting her horse.\nMorning, however, found her in no dis\nposition to rest. It was not activity\nthat she craved, or excitement, or\npleasure. An unerring instinct, rising\nclear from the thronging sensations of\nthe last few days, told her that she\nhad missed something in life. What\never this something was, she had baf\nfling intimations of it, hopes that faded\non the verge of realizations, haunting\npromises that were unfulfilled. What\never it was, It had remained hidden\nand unknowm at home, and here In the\nWest it began to allure and drive her\nto discovery. Therefore she could not\nrest; she wanted to go and see; she\nwas no longer chasing phantoms; it\nwas a hunt for treasure that held\naloof, as intangible as the substance of\ndreams.\nUpon the morning after the end of\nthe round-up, when she went out on\nthe porch, her brother and Stillwell\nappeared to be arguing about the iden\ntity of a horse.\n“Wal, I reckon It\'s my old roan,”\nsaid Stillwell, shading his eyes with\nhis hand.\n“Bill, if that Isn’t Stewart’s horse\nmy eyes are going back on me,” replied\nAl. “It’s not the color or-shape—the\ndistance is too far to judge by that.\nIt’s the motion —the swing.”\n“A*, mebbe you’re right. But they\nain’t no rider up on thet hoss. Flo,\nfetch my glass.”\nFlorence went into the house, while\nMadeline tried to discover the object\nof attention. Presently far up the gray\nhollow along a foothill she saw dust,\nand then the dark, moving figure of a\nhorse. She was watching when Flor\nence returned with the glass. Bill\ntook a long look, adjusted the glasses\ncarefully, and tried again.\n“Wal, I hate to admit my eyes are\ngettin’ pore. But I guess I’ll hev to.\nThet’s Gene Stewart’s hoss, saddled,\nan’ cornin’ at a fast clip without a\nrider. It’s amazin’ strange, an’ some\nin keepin’ with other things concernin\'\nGene.”\n“Give me the glass,” said Al. “Yes,\nI was right. Bill, the horse is hot\nfrightened. He’s coming steadily; he’s\ngot somethin? on his mind.’’\nThe wide hollow sloping up into the\nfoothills lay open to\' unobstructed\nview, and less than half a mile distant\nMadeline saw the riderless horse com\ning along the white trail at a rapid\ncanter. A shrill, piercing whistle pealed\nin.\n“Wal, he’s seen us, thet’s sure,” said\nBill.\nThe horse neared the corrals, disap\npeared into a lane, and then, breaking\nhis gait again, thundered into the in\nclosure and pounded to a halt some\ntwenty yards from where Stillwell\nwaited for him.\nOne look at him at close range in\nthe clear light of day was enough foi\nMadeline to award him a blue ribbon\nover all horses, even the prize-winner,\nWhite Stockings. The cowboy’s great\nsteed was no lithe, slender-bodied mus\nstang. He was a charger, almost tre\nmendous of build, with a black coat\nfaintly mottled In gray, and It shone\nlike polished\' glass In the sun. Evi\ndently he had been carefully dressed\ndown for this occasion, for there was\nno dust on him, nor a kink in his beau\ntiful mane, nor a mark on his glossy\nhide.\n“Come hyar, you son-of-a-gun,” said\nStillwell.\nThe horse dropped his head, snorted,\nand came obediently up. He was nei\nther shy nor wild. Unhooking the stir\nrups from the pommel. Stillwell let\nthem fall and began to search the sad\ndle for something which he evidently\nexpected to find. Presently from some\nwhere among the trappings, he pro\nducers folded bit of paper, and after\nscrutinizing it handed it to Al.\n“Addressed to you; an’ I’ll bet you\ntwo bits I know what’s in it,” he said.\nAlfred unfolded the letter, read It.\nand then looked at Stillwell.\n“Bill, you’re a pretty good cuesser.\nGene’s made for-the border. He sent\nthe horse by somebody, no names men\nspeak at Pilgrim Baptist church at\n8 P. M. /\nFor Missionary Service\nBy E. W. Grilles.\nIn responding to calls for service,\nthose who are able to pay are asked\nto do so at the rate of the salary re\nceived by those who extend the calls,\nfor the time required and expenses.\nAs my work is entirely unprofes\nsional and unofficial I pay the full\nrate for traveling and other expenses.\n■mm\n*\nmtm\ntioned, and wants my sister to have\nhim if she will accept.”\nmention of Danny Mains?”\nasked the rancher.\n“Not a word.”\n“Thet’s bad. Gene\'i know about\nDanny if anybody did. But he’s a\ndose-mouthed cuss. So he’s sure hit\ntin’ for Mexico. \' Wonder if Danny’s\nfoln’, too? Wai, there’s two of the\nbest cowmen I ever seen, gone to h—l,\nan’ Tm sorry. 4 *\n"With that he bowed his head and,\n(Tumbling to himself, went into the\nhouse. Alfred lifted the reins over\nthe head of the horse and, leading him\nto Madeline, slipped the knot over her\narm and placed the letter in her hand.\n“Majesty, I’d accept the horse,” he\nsaid. "Stewart is only a cowboy now,\nand as tough as any I’ve known. But\nhe comes of a good family. He was a\ncollege man and a gentleman once. He\nwent to the bad out here, like so many\nfellows go, like I nearly did. Then\nhe had told me about his sister and\nmother. He cared a good deal for\nthem. I think he has been a source of\nunhappiness to them. It was mostly\nwhen h£ was reminded of this in some\nway that he’d get drunk. I have al\nways stuck to him, and I would do .so\nyet if I had a chance. You read the\nletter, sister, and accept the horse.”\'\nIn silence Madeline bent her gaze\nfrom her brother’s face to the letter:\n“Friend Al: I’m sending my horse\ndown to you because I’m going away\nand haven’t the nerve to take him\nwhere he’d get\' hurt or fall into\nstrange hands.\n“If you think it’s all right, why, give\nhim to your sister with my respects.\nBut if you don’t like the idea, Al, or\nIf she won’t have him, then he’s for\nyou. I’m hoping your sister will take\nhim. She’ll be good to him, and she\ncan afford to take care of him. And,\nwhile I’m waiting to be plugged by a\nGreaser bullet, if I happen to have\na picture in mind of how she’ll look\nupon my horse, why, man, it’s not\ngoing to make any difference to you.\nShe needn’t ever know it.\n“Between you and me, Al, don’t let\nher or Flo ride alone over Don Carlos’\nway. If I had time I could tell you\nsomething about that slick Greaser.\nAnd tell your sister, if there’s ever\nany reason for her to run away from\nanybody when she’s up on that roan,\nJust let her lean over and yell in his\near. She\'ll find herself riding the\nwind. So long.\n“GENE STEWAKT.”\nMadeline thoughtfully folded the\n“How He Must Love His Horse!"\nletter and murmured. “How he must\nlovfc his horse!”\n“Well, I should say so,” replied Al\nfred. “Flo will tell you. She’s the\nonly person Gene ever let ride that\nhorse. Weil, sister mine, how about\nIt —will you accept the horse?’’\n“Assuredly. And very happy in\ndeed am Ito get him. Al, you said,\nI think, that Mr. Stewart named him\naftdr me—saw my nickname in the\nNew York paper?"\n“Yes.”\n“Well, I will not change his name.\nBut, Al, how shall I ever climb up on\nhim? He’s taller than I am. What\na giant of a horse! Oh, look at him—\nhe’s nosing my hand. I really believe\nhe understood what I said. Al, did\nyou ever see such a splendid head and\nsuch beautiful eyes? They are so\nlarge and dark and soft—and human.\nOh, I am a fickle woman, for I am\nforgetting White Stockings.”\n“I’ll gamble he’ll make you forget\nany other horse,” said Alfred. “You’ll\nhave to get on him from the porch." -\nMadeline led the horse to and fro,\nand was delighted with his gentleness.\nShe discovered that he did not need\nto be led. He came at her call, fol\nlowed her like a pet dog, rubbed his\nblack muzzle against her. Sometimes,\nat the turns in tfiblr walk, he lifted\nhis head and with ears forward looked\nup the trail by which he had come,\nand beyond the foothills. He was\nlooking over the range. Someone was\ncalling to him, perhaps, from beyond\nthe mountains. Madeline liked him\nthe better for that memory, and pitied\nthe wayward cowboy who had parted\nwith nis only possession for very\nlove of It.\nAt -supper-time Madeline was unusu\nally thoughtful. Later, when they as\nsembled on the porch to watch the\nsunset, Stillwell’s humorous com\nplainings inspired the Inception of an\nidea which flashed up in her mind\nswift as lightning. And then by lis\ntening sympathetically she encouraged\nhim to recite the troubles of a poor\ncattleman. They were many and long\nPhone Dale 9652 >\nP. H. ENMARK\nr cles, Supplies and Repairs\nGO-CARTS RE-TIRED\n608 University\nSt. Paul\ndisheveled, alighted with the man of\nher hair tumbling around her.\nAlfred met her, and his exclamation,\nand Florence’s rapt eyes shining on *\nher face, and Stillwell’s speechless-\nness made her self-conscious. Laugh\ning, she tried to put up the mass of\nhair.\n“My hat —and my combs —went to\nthe wind. 1 thought—my hair would\ngo, too. . . . There Is the evening\nstar. . • • V I think I am very hun\ngry."\nAnd then she gave up trying to\nfasten up her hair, which fell again in\na golden mass.\n“Mr. Stillwell,” she began, and\npaused, strangely aware of a hurried\nnote, a deeper ring in her voice. “Mr.\nStillwell, I want to buy your ranch —\nto engage you as my superintendent.\nI want to buy Don Carlos’ ranch and\nother property to the extent, say, of\nfifty thousand acres. I want you to\nbuy horses and cattle —in short, to\nmake all those Improvements which\nyou said you had so long dreamed of.\nThen I have ideas of my own, in the\ndevelopment of which I must have\nyour advice and Alfred’s. I Intend to\nbetter the condition of those poor Mex\nicans In the valley. I intend to make\nlife a little more worth living for\nthem and for the cowboys of this\nrange. Tomorrow we shall talk it\nall over, plan all the business details.”\nMadeline turned from the huge,\never-widening smile that beamed down\nupon her and held out her hands to\nher brother.\n“Alfred, strange, is It not, my com\ning out to you? Nay, don’t smile. I\nhope I have found myself—my work,\nmy happiness—here under the light\nof that western star."\nCHAPTER VII\nHer Majesty’s Rancho.\nFive months brought all that Still\nwell had dreamed of, and so many\nmore changes and improvements and\nInnovations that it was as if a magic\ntouch had transformed the old ranch.\nMadeline and Alfred and Florence\nhad talked over a fitting name, and\nhad decided on one chosen by Made\nline. But this instance was the only\none in the course of developments in\nwhich Madeline’s wishes were not\ncomplied with. The cowboys named\nthe new ranch “Her Majesty’s Ran\ncho.” Stillwell said the names cow\nboys bestowed were felicitous, and as\nunchangeable as the everlasting hills;\nFlorence went over to the enemy; and\nAlfred, laughing at Madeline’s protest,\ndeclared the cowboys had elected her\nqueen of the ranges, and that there\nwas no help for it. So the name stood\n“Her Majesty’s Rancho.”\nAll that had been left of the old\nSpanish house which had been Still\nwell’s home for so long was the bare,\nmassive structure, and some of this\nhad been cut away for new doors and\nwindows. Every modern convenience,\neven to hot and cold running water\nand acetylene light, had been in\nstalled ; and the whole - interior painted\nand carpentered and furnished. The\nIdeal sought had not been luxury, but\ncomfort. Every door into the patio\nlooked out upon dark, rich grass and\nsweet-faced flowers, and every win\ndow looked down the green slopes.\nMadeline Hammond cherished a\nfancy that the transformation she had\nwrought in the old Spanish house and\nIn the people with whom she had sur\nrounded herself, great as that trans\nformation had been, was as nothing\ncompared to the one wrought in her\nself. She had found an object In life.\nShe had seen her brother through his\ndifficulties, on the road to all the suc\ncess and prosperity that he cared for.\nMadeline had been a conscientious\nstudent of ranching and an apt pupil\nof Stillwell. The old cattleman, in his\nsimplicity, gave her the place in his\nheart that was meant for the daugh\nter he" had never had. His pride In\nher, Madeline thought, was beyond\nreason or belief or words to tell.\nUnder his guidance, sometimes accom\npanied by Alfred and Florence, Made\nline had ridden the ranges and had\nstudied the life and work of theTow\nboys. Sometimes she looked in her\nmirror and laughed with sheer joy at\nsight* of the lithe, audacious, brown\nfaced, flashing-eyed creature reflected\nthere. It was not so much Joy In her\nbeauty as sheer Joy of life. Eastern\ncritics had been wont to call her\nbeautiful In those days when she had\nbeen pale and slender and proud and\ncold. She laughed. If they could only\nsee her nowl From the tip of her\ngolden head to her feet she was alive,\npulsating, on fire.\nSometimes she thought of her par\nents, sister, friends, of how they had\npersistently refused to believe she\ncould or would stay In the West. They\nwere always asking her to come home.\nShe wrote that she would return to\nher old home some time, of course, for\na visit; and letters such as this\nbrought returns that amused Made\nline, sometimes saddened her. Her\nfather’s business had been such that\nhe could not leave it for the time re\nquired for a western trip, or else,\naccording to his letter, he would have\ncome for her. Mrs. Hammond could\nnot have been driven to cross the\nHudson river; her un-American idea\nof the wilderness westward was that\nIndians still chased buffalo on the out\nskirts of Chicago. Madeline\'s sister\nHelen had long been eager to come, as\nmuch from curiosity, Madeline\nthought, as from sisterly regard. And\nat length Madeline concluded that the\nproof of her breaking permanent ties\nmight better be seen by visiting rela\ntives and friends before she went back\nEast. With that in mind she invited\nHelen to visit her during the summer,\nand bring as many friends as she\nliked.\n\\ No slight task Indeed was it to over\n(To be continuued next week)\nTel.

One hi in -the Valley\nof the Kings, another at Memphis,\nwhich was the oldest capital of Egypt;\na third in Palestine, and another in\nBabylonh, where in connection with\nthe expedition of the British museum,\nan ancient temple believed to have\nbeen built 3,000 years before the\nbirth of Christ was discovered. An\nnouncement of the finding of this tem\nple was recently made. Inscriptions\nwere found showing that King Nebu\nchadnezzar repaired the place during\nhis reign in the Sixth century, B. C.\nExcavation Work Continuous.\nThe university has arranged the\nwork of her excavators so that when\nthe hot weather season comes in one\nplace they move to another, assuring\nalmost continuous effort.\nThe work now coming to a close is\n*at Thebes in an area adjoining the\nconcession of Lord Carnarvon. During\nthe two seasons of digging at Thebes\nseveral tombs have been discovered\nconstructed in the same wty as thut\nof Tut-Ankh-Amen, but all of them open\nand looted. The objects found in each\nwere not of interest to robbers, such\nas canopic jars, ushabtls, inscriptions\nand papyri.\nIn the last named class of objects a\nreally notable discovery was made at\nthe close of last season, when two\nsealed pottery cylinders were found\nwithin the entrance chamber of a\ntomb, which contained rolls*of papyri.\nThese were in a perfect state of pres\nervation. On the outside of each roll\nwas a document\' written in ancient\nGreek, and upon examination the\npapyri proved to be Demotic docu\nments dating from 818 B. O. to 265\nB. O. They are mostly contracts, and\ncontain the business transactions of\na family during the period of years\nwhich they covered. These papyri\nare now being translated in the uni\nversity museum.\nAll of tbe tombs discovered on tbe\nmuseum\'s concession were of officials\nof tbe government of Thebes who\nwished to be burled near the kings,\nand whose tombs are, therefore, found\nin close proximity to the royal resting\nplaces.\nAt the same time thet the univer\nsity museum is working this conces\nsion at Thebes it Is also excavating\nat Memphis, 14 miles above Cairo,\nwhere the museum expedition discov\nered several years ago the royal pal\nace of Merenptah, an extensive struc\nture covering a large area and In\nclosing numerous courts. The floors\nof this temple are found 25 feet below\nthe surface of the ground. The lower\nwalls, and sometimes doorways and\nparts of columns, are found standing.\nTut’s Father-In-Law.\nOne of the interesting discoveries\nmade at this place is the head of a\nlife-site statue of Akhnaton, the fa\nther-ln-law of Tut-Ankh-Amen. The\nfeatures are exquisitely modeled and\nthe sensitive face Is rendered In a\nwonderfully lifelike manner.\nThe throne room of the Merenptah\npalace, especially the dais shows rich\nsculpture and elaborate use of color.\nThe ornaments and hieroglyphic In\nscriptions on the columns, and the\nstonework surrounding the doorways,\nare Inlaid with beautiful pale fayenee.\nSurrounding the throne room are\ndressing rooms, retiring rooms, and\na bathroom, which originally had run\nning water.\nExcavation here Is still In progress,\nand Its completion is expected to\nthrow much light on the domestic and\nofficial life of the Pharaohs.\nMemphis was the capital of Egypt\nfrom the earliest times down to about\n2,000 B. C. Then the Pharaohs moved\ntheir capital south to Thebes, which\narose to great-splendor. Herodotus re\nferred to the hundred gates of Thebes.\nThis city remained the capital until\nAlexander the Great founded the new\ncapital at Alexandria, except for that\nbrief Interval when Akhnaton built\nthis new capital at Tell-el-Amsrna in\norder that he might start everything\nIn Egypt afresh; religion, art, archi\ntecture and government His Interest\ning experiment lasted for about a gen\neration, or until Tut-Ankh-Amen re\nstored the old religion, reversed the pol\nicy of father-in-law, changed his name\nfrom Tut-Ankh-Aton to Tut-Ankh-Amen\nas a symbol of his reversion, and went\nback to Thebes as the seat of his gov\nernment\nMerenptah, who is regarded by most\nauthorities as the Pharaoh of the\nExodus, reigned 1225 B.
