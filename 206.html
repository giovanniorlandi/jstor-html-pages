The court\'s decision will, mean the savinf tn the CiYm-menwpnltli, r of between $7,000 and $8,000 in tax., es, besides the local levies made by, , the town of Salem, where Coopei, , died.

Hughes and his campaign, managers if they desired to make the, eight-hour day legislation the overshadowing, issue in the Presidential, campaign. The Democrats added that, they were not afraid to face the issue, and did not anticipate any unfavorable, verdict of the Ame-icar., people on this question when once it, was ciearly explained to them. 1, The eight-hour day legislation, it i.?, explained, was pushed so hastily\', through Congress primarily to avertj, a strike of 400,000 trainmen on the J, railroads, which would not only have j, brought to a standstill An-erica\'s |, transportation system but would have |, brought paralysis to the who!? of j, American industrial life. Such ui, strike, it is contended, would have |, cost the American people $1,000,000,000,, and it was to avert these losses, that the legislation was passed., As to the principle of the eight-hour, day, the Democrats do not believe, Republicans will dare to attack it, as], it is i,ow an accepted social condition, in all leading American industries., Representative\' Carter Class, cf, Virginia, co-author of the Federal, reserve banking system, has received, a lumber of letters, some of which, criticized the legislation. In -answer, t > ihese, Mr. Glass told his correspon, ients that they did not appreciate, what enormous losses to \\meric\'-?r., bfslness were averted by stop. ;ng the, strike., The loss by railroads aline, siiJ, Mr. Glass in a letter to a hud less, friend, would have been $8,000,000 a, tlay, which in a week would have totaled, the amount of the wage increase, the eight hour day would entail upon, the railroads for an enGre >car., These figures, the Virginian said, are, the railroads. In two months time,, added Mr. Glass, and it was likely that, the strike, once called, would have, lasted cnat long, would hav? cost the, carriers a sum equal to the augr?, pate of the wage increase for 10, years., But the railroads, Mr. Glass vent, on to say, would not hac? been the, only sufferers!. American business, generally would have been paralyzed, Factores, he said, would h-nj been, compelled lo close down bof.i na they, could not i.-ove their product* t.? llio, niaiKets; stores would have been compelled, to curtail their bus", -ess:, because, they could not get w&rej, and, all lines of business generally would, have been given a trerrendous setl:\\ck., These losses, Mr. Ghss said,, would have mounted into the millions, I, far greater than the losses by tho, railroads., Representative T. W. Sims, of Ten, nessee. a member of the Interstate, and Foreign Commerce Commitee, in, discussing this question with his colleagues, in the commitee, differed with, some, of those who contended thai, the eight-hour day would cost the, railroads ?60,000,000 a year. ), "You forget," said Judge 7 S\'n-s,, "that a strike on the railroads, tying, up all transportation facilities, would, mean a loss of ?60,000,000 a day to, the American business man. The railroads\', additional expenses of $6:,0(.\'G,, \')00 a year, it it cost them that sum,, is not a drop in the bucket- What, have to do is to avert a strike which, will bring such widespread disaster, tp American business, much less the, widespread suffering it will cause, thousands of people who cannot get, food supplies. The question, therefore,, is whether we shall^,, jet trip, American people lost $60,000,000 a, day or increase the expenses of the, railroad $60,000,000 a year. fli*".-! is, only one answer, and that is to ave*t, the strike, and the only way in sight, THE WEATHEB , jiLocal, showers today; tomor- ., row partly cloudy: not much, ch tn^e in temperature; light, variable winds. \', High tjdo 3:07 a. in. and ..., 3:2? p. m.

He advocated, a more stringent law than that proposed,, and one that would particularly, restrict the use of the Congressional, frank to prevent Senators" pr, Representatives from; sending out, campaign appeals at Government expense., He read a letter from Senator, Ashurst to a constituent reciting, his record as a basis for support,, nmi said he understood that 70,, 000 of these had been franked out,, in violation of the privilege., "If the Senator charges that this v, is a violation of the law," said Senator, Ashurst, when he got the floor,, "he has sweetbreads for brains.", He explained that his letter had, been submitted and approved bv the, Postmaster-General and one of his, assistants as being matter which, could be franked, and told how form!, er President Taft, when in the Philip[, pines, and the then Secretary of War, Root exchanged cablegrams at 52, I cents a word, paid by the Govern>, ment, to discuss Mr. Taft\'s health, land a horseback ride., | Calling Senator Curtis the "Pharisee, from Kansas" and brushing aside, several chairs. \',he strode across the, \\ centre aisle and shook \' his finger, Qovirafnr Curtic\' nnsp.
