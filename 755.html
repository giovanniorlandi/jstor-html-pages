        <pre>['Scandal Among Cadets: An Historical Verdict \nSIDNEY FORMAN \nTeachers College, Columbia University \n \nRecent scandals over violations of the honor \ncode at the Air Force Academy, together \nwith the punitive action taken against over \n100 cadets, raise agitated and sombre \nquestions about character education in \nAmerican schools and colleges generally. In \nhistorical perspective, the fault may lie far \nless with students than with the devitalizing \nof the concept of honor as an authentic and \npervasive educational ideal. Now the \nlibrarian at Teachers College, Columbia \nUniversity, Dr. Forman, whose PhD is in \nhistory, was formerly archivist, official \nhistorian, and librarian at the US Military \nAcademy. \n \nTHE TRAGIC SEPARATION from the Air \nForce Academy at Colorado Springs of 105 \ncadets charged with cheating necessarily \nraises various questions. Should an initial \nbreach of the Academy rule be treated as a \ncrime for which dismissal is an appropriate \npunishment? Can a repetition of such a \nscandal be prevented? What are the \nimplications of this event for the national \nservice academies and for the ethical and \nmoral education of young men and women \nat American colleges everywhere? A simple, \nsequential account of the Honor System at \nthe senior service academy—the United \nStates Military Academy at West Point, New \nYork—which served as a pattern for all of \nthe service academies\' ethical and moral \nprograms, provides fresh insights into the \nwidely publicized honor violations at \nColorado Springs. \n \nWhen the US Military Academy was \nestablished in 1802, the cadets were \nendowed with the military profession\'s ideal \nof honor. A military publication of 1793 \ninstructed the officer, ". . . in fine, the \nCaptain is to be true to his country, make \nservice his business, true honor his object" \n(8). The concept was further elaborated in a \nWest Point text in which the soldier\'s honor \nwas described as an attribute associated \nwith discipline, firmness, and intrepidity; it \nwas a characteristic said to give a military \nforce superior weight and execution in attack \n(7). \n \nAs the Military Academy developed in the \nnineteenth century, the concepts of honor of \nthe officer corps were integrated into the \nstructure of the institution. Three \norganizational and curricular channels, \nthrough which military character, honor, \nand—most essentially—a love for the truth \nwere taught to the Corps of Cadets, became \napparent. The first was through the Chaplain \nand the course of religious and ethical \ntraining. The second was through the officer \npersonnel who had direct contact with the \ncadets. The third was through a cultivation \nof the aspiration to maintain the traditions of \nthe Corps of Cadets, a responsibility \nnurtured by the upper classmen and more \nparticularly by the First Class (the seniors). \nTHE RELIGIOUS BULWARK \n \nRegular religious training began with the \nappointment of the first chaplain in 1813, the \nReverend Adam Empie, who was also \nProfessor of Ethics, History, and Geography. \nHis duties brought him into almost daily \ncontact with every cadet. In 1820, the first \ntextbook in ethics was introduced, William \nPaley\'s The Principles of Moral and Political \nPhilosophy (7), widely used in American \ncolleges. Paley\'s book was superseded in \n1844 by Francis Wayland\'s The Elements of \nMoral Science, which emphasized the \nevangelical sanctions for "the truth, the \nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth" (5?). \nIn 1860, the Reverend John William French, \nas Chaplain and Professor of Ethics, \nprepared his own text and developed the \nprinciples of ethics with specific applications \nand examples pertaining to the life of a \ncadet. "With us," he said, "truthfulness is to \nbe honored, not only as a religious, a moral, \nand a military virtue, but as one that is \nancestral." He pointed out to the young \ncadet: \n \nTruthfulness is part of the honor of a soldier. \nStratagems to deceive an enemy are lawful \n', 'and right. But apart from this, a true soldier \nknows not how to violate the truth. So \ndelicate is the military profession in this \nrespect, that offences against the truth \nwhich public sentiment might mark as trivial \nin other relations, are there regarded as a \nlasting stain on honor. Also the whole \nsystem of military discipline is deranged, if \nthere cannot be perfect reliance on personal \nand official statements. Let no one enter on \nmilitary life as his profession, who is not \nunfaltering in veracity (4). \n \nWilliam M. Postlethwaite was the last \nChaplain who taught ethics. He was \nappointed on December 21, 1881. Neither \nhis course nor his personality struck the \ncadets too favorably, and they found his \nSunday sermons, which they derisively \ncalled "Possies," burdensome and boring. \nAlthough Postlethwaite\'s death on January \n10, 1896, was mourned at West Point, only \nfive days later, the Academic Board \nrecommended that his professorship be \ndissolved and his teaching duties severed \nfrom the chaplaincy. The Board preferred a \nchaplain appointed from civil life and free of \nany academic responsibilities. Geography \nhad not been taught for a number of years; \nhistory was transferred to the Department of \nLaw, and the teaching of ethics was dropped \nfrom the curriculum, all by act of 18 \nFebruary, 1896. In the matter of ethics, the \nAcademic Board reasoned that "the \ninfluences, both social and official, under \nwhich the training of the cadets is carried on, \nare such as to minimize the necessity of \nformal instruction in this subject from \ntextbooks. . . ." The Board also cited the \nvigorous religious life at the academy. The \nchaplain was expected to devote his time \nmore specifically to awakening and \ncultivating religious interest among cadets. \n \nThe chaplaincy was supplemented by a \npowerful branch of the Young Men\'s \nChristian Association, the primary object of \nwhich was ". . . to raise and maintain the \nmoral standards of the Corps." At West \nPoint, the YMCA stemmed from cadet \nprayer meetings organized by Lt. Oliver O. \nHoward in 1857. In i88o,%the supporters of \nthe prayer meeting formed themselves into a \nbranch of the YMCA. Emory Upton, as \ncommandant in 1870, gave the prayer \nmeetings permanent status by assigning \nDialectic Hall for the purpose; later Kendrick \nHall became the regular meeting place. For \nat least three decades after its formation, the \nYMCA was the largest and most influential \ncadet extra-curricular organization, listing \namong its members by the turn of the \ncentury not only the various Protestant \ndenominations represented at West Point, \nbut also Catholics, a Jew, a Mormon, and a \ncadet who listed himself as an "infidel." The \nYMCA sponsored prayer meetings, a \nSunday school, Bible-study groups, a cadet \nhandbook, and visiting lecturers on religious \nand secular subjects; it sent cadet delegates \nto intercollegiate meetings, and in all of its \ncombined activities, it provided a pervasive \nreligious, ethical, and group sanction for \nhonesty and honor in all cadet life (1). The \ncadet handbook, Bugle Notes, first \npublished in 1907, remained under YMCA \nauspices until 1924 (5). The first issue \ncontained a guide map of West Point, \ninformation about campus religious activities \nand cadet customs, and a lengthy article on \nCorps Honor by Professor C. W. Larned. \nThe YMCA activities also brought into close \nunion with West Point religious life Anna and \nSusan B. Warner, both famous writers of \nmoralistic, religious novels, who owned \nConstitution Island in the Hudson River, \nopposite West Point. The Warners \nconducted Bible classes for the ladies on the \npost as well as for the cadets. In addition to \nits great influence on the West Point honor \ncode, the YMCA also favored an \namelioration of rough hazing, encouraged \nthe growing West Point interest in sports, \nand laid the ethical foundation for a more \nhumane relationship between the officer and \nthe enlisted man and between the officer \nand the new peoples he was thrown into \ncontact with during and after the war with \nSpain. \n \nIn retrospect, it appears to be an unfortunate \nloss to the Military Academy that the \nsecularism and pacifism which came in the \nwake of World War I weakened the \ninfluences of the YMCA organization and \nfinally led, in 1933, to its reorganization into \na Cadet Lecture Committee, whose sole \nobject was to sponsor popular entertainment \nand lectures. \n', "OFFICERS AS MODELS \n \nThe second important channel of character \ntraining was in the hands of the officers at \nWest Point. They were in control of every \nphase of the life of the cadet. In carrying out \ntheir administrative duties, and in their dayto-day\ncontact with the individual cadet, the \nobject of moulding soldierly character \nbecame a constant guide. When the Corps \nof Cadets was small, the Superintendent \ntook a fatherly interest in each cadet's \nwelfare and training. This was true in the \nearly Military Academy of Jonathan Williams \n(1802-1803, 1805-1812), Alden Partridge \n(1815-1817), and Sylvanus Thayer (18171833).\nMuch of the responsibility of \ninterpreting the traditions of the military \nprofession to the individual cadet in the most \nimmediate and practical fashion was \ndelegated to the officers of the Department \nof Tactics. Their responsibilities grew out of \nthe organization of the cadets by Sylvanus \nThayer into a battalion of two companies. He \nappointed an officer to command the \nbattalion and to serve as instructor of \ninfantry tactics and soldierly discipline. The \nposition was not known as Commandant of \nCadets until the Regulations of 1825 were \npromulgated. The Commandant's \nresponsibilities eventually encompassed a \nmilitary training department which instructed \nthe cadet in infantry tactics and in the duties \nin camp and garrison of privates, \nnoncommissioned officers, and officers, \nincluding those of guard and police. For \nadministrative and training purposes, many \nresponsibilities for self-government were \ndelegated to the cadets themselves. A \nsystem of cadet organization and \nresponsibility for practical military training \nled to a considerable delegation of \nresponsibility for cadet character training to \ncadet officers and upperclassmen. \n \nProfessor Peter S. Michie, long associated \nwith the Academy, in a study of Emory \nUpton, outlined the importance of the office \nof the Commandant of Cadets and \ndelineated the model character of the ideal \nCommandant: \n \nHis example should be that of the ideal \nsoldier, officer, and gentleman. He should \ncultivate soldierly honor among the cadets \nuntil it attains a vigorous growth. He should \nrebuke with severity the first tendency to \nprevarication or dishonesty in word or act. \nWith a system of divided responsibilities, \nwhich ultimately rests on one or two \ncomrades, he should control all by strict and \nincreasing exactions. \n \nTo make his government successful he \nshould be endowed with the highest \nsoldierly qualities in personal bearing at drill, \nand even in every act while subject to the \nvision of his corps (6). \n \nThe Commandant's recognition of his full \nresponsibility for West Point character \ntraining has been most fully stated by \nLieutenant Colonel Samuel M. Mills in the \nAnnual Report of the Superintendent in \n1896: \n \nIt is thus by constantly and unceasingly, \npatiently and earnestly placing before the \ncadet his obligations to duty and impressing \nupon him the qualities of mind and character \nthat constitutes the high-minded truthful, and \nconscientious officer, that the commandant \nof cadets in my judgement, fulfills the most \nimportant part of his many responsible \nduties. \nTRADITION AND CADET \nINITIATIVE \n \nPerhaps the most important factor in \ncharacter training and indoctrination in a \nlove of honor and truth has been the Corps \nof Cadets themselves. Any adherence to \nprinciple would quickly break down if it were \nnot for the Corps's desire to preserve it. This \nresponsibility, too, was the outgrowth of \nyears of trial and experience. A cause \ncelebre which shook the academy in 1871, \nand was remembered for many years \nafterward, exemplified the development of \nthe voluntary acceptance of the honor code \nby the Corps of Cadets. \n \nThree young cadets of the Fourth Class \nbroke the regulations with what were \nrelatively minor offenses. In order to protect \nthemselves from punishment, they \ncompounded their offenses by an intentional \nfalsehood. When the facts became known, \nthe First Class gathered spontaneously, \n", 'went to the rooms of the delinquent cadets, \ngave them some civilian clothes and money, \nand peremptorily directed them to leave the \npost. The First Class was influenced by the \nfact that during the previous years, a \nnumber of cadets who had been dismissed \nby courts martial, or who had been \nrecommended for discharge by the \nAcademic Board, were reinstated through \nthe influence of members of Congress or by \nthe intervention of the President or the \nSecretary of War. Also, in the few years \nafter the Civil War, cadet discipline had \nrelaxed considerably, and infractions of \nethical rules were allowed to pass without \npunishment. \n \nThe attempt to restore the reputation of the \nCorps of Cadets was reported in the press \nthroughout the country and finally brought \non a full Congressional investigation. The \ninquiry brought out the facts that the \nSuperintendent, General Pitcher, and the \nCommandant, General Upton, although \ndisapproving of the illegal act of the First \nClass, at least by inference approved of their \nmotive and felt that it might have good \nresults. The hearing also brought out the \nfact that only one similar case of putting a \ncadet off the post for making a false \nstatement was known to the persons \nquestioned, although such acts were \naccepted by the Corps as being traditional \n(3). At the hearing, both Generals Pitcher \nand Upton expressed their particular \ncondemnation of the vice of lying. The case \nwas eventually quashed, but not without \nmuch public discussion and general \ncondemnation of the action of the First Class \nwith some approval of their motive. Some \nslight punishment was meted out to the First \nClass. \n \nIt was only a natural development that the \nhandling of honor cases was entrusted by \nthe Corps of Cadets to a representative \ncommittee. The first group of this nature \nappears to have been called the Vigilance \nCommittee, which was organized some \nyears after the Congressional investigation \nof 1871 and included class representatives \nfrom each company. Although the existence \nof this kind of voluntary organization was \nknown to the Academy authorities, the \nsuccessive vigilance committees had no \nofficial status. It was to the authority of the \nethics textbook rather than the authority of a \ncadet committee or an "honor system" that \nColonel Wesley Merritt referred when he \npublicly admonished a cadet in 1886 for a \nviolation of ethical standards. \nTHE CROWNING GLORY \n \nAs the West Point centennial approached, \nthe training in honor and character was not \nconsidered simply as an ordinary cultivation \nin the sense of the civilian world, but was put \nforward as the institution\'s "crowning glory" \ndeveloped at West Point as the elementary \ntraining school for American Army officers. \nThe West Point honor system was \nrepresented as being different both in \nadministration and principle from the \nsystems developed at other schools which \nwere directed toward preventing cheating in \nexaminations or to enforce compliance with \nregulations. It was a code of ethics which \naffected every phase of life of the cadet and \nofficer, and was looked upon as the only \nbasis upon which an Army could \nsuccessfully exist (2). Newton D. Baker, as \nSecretary of War, emphasized these virtues \nfor the soldier with great insight. He wrote to \nthe Chairman of the Committee on Military \nAffairs on May 17, 1920, \n \nMen may be inexact or even untruthful in \nordinary matters, and suffer as a \nconsequence only the disesteem of their \nassociates, or even the inconveniences of \nunfavorable litigation, but the inexact or \nuntruthful soldier trifles with the lives of his \nfellowmen, and the honor of his government; \nand it is, therefore, no matter of idle pride, \nbut rather of stern disciplinary necessity that \nmakes West Point require of her students a \ncharacter for trustworthiness which knows \nno evasions. In the final analysis of the West \nPoint product, character is the most precious \ncomponent. \n \nDuring World War I, the accelerated \ngraduation of successive West Point classes \nled to an almost complete dissolution of the \nMilitary Academy. In the period of \nreorganization which followed, the burden of \nperpetuating the customs of the Corps \nrested on the class of 1920. The class \nentered on weeks of debate and argument, \nand finally, through a committee reportedly \n', 'headed by Cadet Earl Blaik, with the \napproval of the academy administration, \npublished the Traditions and Customs of the \nCorps of Cadets (West Point, 1920) as a \nbrief guide to acquiring "the true spirit of \nWest Point." The short codification listed the \nprivileges and restrictions of the Fourth \nClass, cadet customs dealing with athletic \ngames and holidays, and cadet \nresponsibilities in regard to subordination, \nduty, and honor. The statement in regard to \nhonor was unequivocal: ". . . the most \ncherished sentiment in the life of the Corps \nis the high regard for honor and truth. . . . \nThe Code of the Profession of the Soldier \ndemands courageous and fearless honesty \nin setting forth the truth regardless of \nconsequences. There is no place in the \nCorps of Cadets or in the Service for a \nquibbler, an evader, or a twister of the truth." \nTo maintain these principles, a cadet honor \ncommittee was set up and officially \nrecognized in 1922, with its duties and \nresponsibilities officially defined. West Point \nnow had, for the first time, an explicit honor \ncode based upon reasoned consent. In \nsubstance, a similar honor code developed \nat the Naval Academy; that of the Air Force \nAcademy was directly adapted from West \nPoint when the Colorado Springs institution \nwas established in 1954-55 by officers \nspecifically selected for their West Point \nexperience. \nSHADOW WITHOUT SUBSTANCE \n \nThe Air Force Academy cheating exposure \nis the fourth widely publicized scandal at the \nservice academies. In 1914, and again in \n1927, there was a similar cheating scandal \nat the Naval Academy in Annapolis. In 1951, \n90 cadets, including 38 football players, \nwere expelled from West Point for cribbing. \nNow more than 100 Air Force cadets have \nbeen forced to leave the Colorado Springs \ninstitution. To lay the blame on "athletic \nprofessionalism" or on the "tremendous \npressure under which cadets work" is not \nsupported by the facts. To criticize the \nservice academy system of selection or to \ncall into question the cadet honor code itself \nserves only to avoid consideration of the \nmore central factors revealed by an \nexamination of the historical record. \n \nThe history of the West Point honor code \nthrusts into relief the conclusion that \nalthough a concern with honor—with ethical \nstandards—was traditional in the services, \nthe particular structure of codification and \nadministration common to the academies is \nin fact a recent development which came \ninto being after World War I. In addition, in \nits traditional nineteenth-century form at \nWest Point, the honor code was \nencompassed in the educational purpose of \nthe institution and was buttressed by a \npervasive curricular and extracurricular \nprogram. The cadets, motivated by a \nsensitive awareness of the character of an \nhonor code, voluntarily entered into a social \ncompact which demanded compliance with \nand enforcement of the necessary ethical \nsystem. The officer corps understood their \nprofessional responsibilities in loco parentis \nand guided the cadets by example and \nexhortation to a mature appreciation of the \nethical standards necessary for the very \nexistence of the military forces of a \ndemocratic society. \n \nChange has undermined the traditional \nnineteenth-century supports for the honor \ncode. Attitude patterns which were best \nsustained by a peer group have now \nbecome colored by administrative coercion \n(1). The academy environment and controls \nhave also been drastically affected by \nincreases in the size and heterogeneity of \nthe student body. Until the administrations of \nthe academies and their respective student \nbodies recognize the erosion of traditional \nsupports for the honor code, and until they \ncooperatively seek to construct new \nbuttresses appropriate for each succeeding \nstudent generation, the institutions will \ninevitably face new scandals. For the \nscandals are only the symptom of the way in \nwhich the honor code has lost its substance \nand vitality, divorced from the curricular and \nextra-curricular context that once gave it \nmeaning as a sought-after ideal in the life of \nthe academy and in the profession of arms \nitself. Moral education cannot be achieved \nthrough the dismissal of students, but \nthrough the discovery of modern and \nrelevant methods of rekindling and \nreinforcing moral aspirations. \nREFERENCES \n \n', '1.
