Ya.. Dec. 10.?Be\nneath sunny skies the ceremonies of\nthe unveiling of the magnificent\netatue of the typical West Virginia\nBoldier here at the capitol gruunds\nthis afternoon took place. The statue,\nwhich is in bronze, is the work of the\ncelebrated sculptor, Henry K. Bush\nrown of Washington, and Is the gift\n-of Colonel William Seymour Edwards\n-of Charleston to the state. I?ov. Carl\n*G. Doney, president of West Virginia\nWesleyan college delivered the invo\n? cation, after which the statue was un\nveiled by Master William Seymour\nChristensen Edwards of Coalburgh.\n\'The flag fell slowly away from the\n?exquisite figure. As the great throng\nof people viewed for the first time the\nclassic outlines a hush fell upon them\n?and then a great cheer burst forth.\nThe work is distinctively the best of\nrthe kind ever seen in West Virginia\nand is so suggestive in its portrayal\n<of the period of the sixties that the\n.most critical persons have nothing\n\' but praise for the statue.\nUpon the platform were many nota\nble personages of this and other\nstates, including Governor William E.\nGlasscock, Governor-elect H. I). Hat\nfield, Dr. Carl G. Doney of Wesleyan,\nthe judges of the state supreme\ncourt, Right Rev. William Loyal Gra\nvatt, bishop of the Episcopal diocese\nof West Virginia. General Romeo H.\nFreer, past commnndcr G. A. R.; Mrs.\nL,a vinia Hoberfield, state president\nWoman\'s Relief corps; the sculptor,\n.Henry K. Bush-Brown, and General\nWILLIAM SEYMOUR EDWARDS,\nDonor of the Statue.\n\'Charles D. Elliott, Colonel William S.\nEdwards, donor of the statue, and\nmany others. Notable periodicals,\nsuch as Collier\'s, Leslies\' Weekly,\nHarper\'s and others, had representa\ntives and photographers in attend\nance.\nThe governor\'s staff was in attend\nance in full uniform, as were also\nprominent officers of the national\niguarcWwith companies of the state\nmilitia. Massed hands furnished the\nimusic, and a picturesque background\n"to the entire scene was the formation\n19S a thousand ichool children carrying\nflowers. These children sang "The\nHymn of the West Virginians," the\nstate song written by Colonel Ed\nwards. A trained chorus of more\nthan a hundred voices led this inspir\ning singing. The state militia ilred a\nsalute as the statue was unveiled and\nthis brought light to the eyes of the\nhundreds of Grand Army men who\nwere prominent in the day\'s program.\nThe gift of the statue to the Grand\nArmy of the Republic and Women\'s"\nRelief corps was then formally made\nby Colonel Edwards in a short but\ndccidedly entertainiDg address. He\nsaid:\n"This splendid figure is net intended\nto represent merely the blue coat and\nbrass buttons that 50 years ago some\ntimes encased the soldier; it is not\nintended to parade the personal glory\nthat sometimes, maybe, might deco\nrate the olhcer to whom chance and\noceasion may have brought distinc\ntion; it is not intended to in any way\naggrandize whose of those yet sur\nviving the tears and the glories of Get\ntysburg. or Antietam, or Shilo, or any\nether of the thousand fields of actual\nbattle, now receive and must ever re\nceive our most reverent homage and\ntenderest esteem!\n"No! No one of these! But, the rath\ner, it is intended to represent and\ndoes represent that glorious a*id he\nroic spirit which Stirrer?., the heart of\ni the man within that blue coat; tl\nI dauntless couragc which lay witl\nthe man whom it was given to goverr\nr.nd command; that supreme loftines\nof soul which made heroes of the nr.\npretentious citizen and coraman man\nand which brought to God\'s service,\nthe service of human freedom, the\nmilitant people of these mountains\nand valleys, amidst the prayers and\nlejoicings of a solicitous and grateful\nworld.\n"This figure and its pedestal typi\nfies and represents the splendid per\nsonality, the unswerving cor . age, the\ndevotion of a great race, a race great\nm Colonial and Revolutionary times;\na race great in meeting every call\nmade by the nation in every crisis of\nthe nation.\n"It. stands for and typifies the spirit\nami power which stood by George\nWashington and s;ived him when th"\nBritish rodoo\'its of the line pc rished\nin that fatal ambush known in all his\ntory as Hraddoek\'s defeat.\n"It stands for the devo\'ion arid <\'ocr\nage \\vhi<h smote Boarvcyn" at Sara\ntoga; which saved Washington at Val\nley Forge; which won Trenton and\nKings Mountain, and which at York\ntown ended Fritish rn!.? \'orcver in tlie\nA in erics n colon i on!\n"It stands far th"> dauntless soul\nthat has made Jack:.en\'s riflemen at\nNew Orleans forever famous; it\nstands tor the intrepid spirit that\nfreed the mouth of the Mississippi\nfrom Finnish domination and lit hit\nPICTURE OF THE MAGNIFICENT BRONZE STATUE ACCEPTED\nBY THE G.

That spirit which\nled them, in instant response to tho\nfirst call of Abraham Lincoln. April\n15. 18G1, to form themselves into\nthose intrepid companies of Home\nGuards, whereby and by whom Wise\nvas driven back across the Alleghe\nnies and Lee and Jackson were hold\nat hay until the later federal armies\nv ere formed and which were, conse\nquently, thereby enabled to save West\nVirginia to the Union. It stands for\nthe militant spirit of the men who\nlaid down the pick and the shovel,\nand the hoe and the mattocks, the\nhammer and the anvil, who put aside\nthe plow, who went forward and, cre\nated the mightiest armies the world\nhas ever known, and of which armies\nyou veterans of the G. A. R. formed\nso illustrious a part!\n"It is this militant, lighting soul of\nthe true West Virginian that this no\nble statue is here to represent.\n"The great figure stands behind all\nof the glory, all of the splendor of our\nWest Virginian in war! He is equally\nthe master personality in peace! The\ncalm, strong face, the unfaltering iv.i\nolution, the coolness and daring, the\nlove of home and country which w\'.ll\nmeet death or give it ere he will let\nthat bles3ed flag fall from his uplifted\nhand, are all embodied here in endur\ning bronze!\n"The figure Is that of no single man.\nIt is the composite representation of\na yet living type. The gifted sculptor\ncreated it in no hurried moment. It\nis the outcome of successive years of\nstudy and travel and association\namong our finest population in divers\nparts of West Virginia, where are yet\npreserved so m*ny splendid types u?\nour militant people. Ix>oic upon this\nface! In it you behold a hundred\nfaces which you have seen and known\nand yet know.\n"The race, the West Virginian, as\nwe know him, as we would wish to\nknow him, lives and will live forever\nin t!iis imperishable bronze to inspire\nfind glorify the generation of today\nand also many a generation yet un\nborn.\n"In tiiis noble face and figure you\nnow possess one of the great master\npieces of the sculptor\'s art in Amer\nica and in the world. Tt typifies the\nspirit of the West Virginian."\nSome years ago, when Colonel Wil\nlifirn Seymour Edwards was speaker\nof the house of delegates he became\nInterested in the history of the move\nment among the people of onco trans\nAllegheny-Virginia for the saving to\nthe Union of that portion of Virginia\nlying chiefly west of the Alleghenies\n? now the state of West Virginia, lie\nlearned how the mountain people or\nVirginia, when he was himself a hoy,\nhad formed themselves into com\npanies of home guards in instant re\nsponse to the first call of Abraham\nLincoln, April 15th, 1S61; how they\nhad fought battles *i?.h the Confed\nerate forces of Wise and Lee and\nJackson before the Federal armies\nwnre formed; how they had driven\nWise back to the valley of Virginia,\nbad held Lee and Jackson at bay un\ntil the Federal armies at last were or\nganized to do them battle; how by\nreason of their early organization, the\nFederal pension laws did not yield\nthem protection and relief; and he\nbecame instrumental in inaugurating\nsnd in finally securing legislation\nwhich nifde provision for these brave\nmen; they were at last paid and pen\nsioned by West Virginia and then the\nFederal government at Washington\nreimbursed the state.\nTouched and Fired by the Heroic i\nHistory.\nThe heroic story touched the heart\ncf Colonel Edwards and fired his\nBpirit, and he then resolved that If\n< ver fate arid fortune should join in\nproviding hirn the means, that he\nwould become Instrumental In rai.s\'n^\na monument to this spirit of liberty\nand to these sons and daughters of\nHeroic sires, whoso promptness in ac\ntion and devotion to the Union made\npossible the creation of tho state of\nWest Virginia.\nFirst Suggestions.\nAbont this time, I8\'jf?-C, he was pay\ning a visit to an old playmate\'s home,\nHenry K.

Tho first\nseries of serious sketches and models\nwere then prepared hy Hush-Brown\nand the development of tho statue be\ngan to go steadily forward. Tho fol\nlowing summer and again the succeed\ning year, Mr. Hu.sh hrown visited tho\nmountain sections of West Virginia,\n?visiting Webster county and ttat.dolph\ncounty, and parts of firoonbrier "oun\nty, and other sections of the state,\n\'with his kodak and sketch hook, meet\ning the people in their homes and on\ncourt days and gaining that familiar\nity with the West. Virginian moun\ntains r that lie lias now so success\nfully portrayed.\nTime Agreed On Five Years.\nAt the beginning, five years were\napportioned as tho period through\n?which the. work should proceed and\nthe payments bo made, being tho time\ndesired by tho artist to complete the\nwork, and it was two years before tho\nartist and h\'.s friends were able to\n(decide upon Just what form tho monu\nment, ou\'iht to tVi.o? it was a gradual\n?working out of the best possible real\nisation of ideals. Finally the decision\nwas made the heroic figure of the\ntypical West Virginian who saved and\nmade the state.\nPraises For Hcroic Figure Shown In\nStudio During Past Year.\nDuring the past year, tho splendid\nfigure?eight feet in height?has been\n?shown to friends in the studio of the\nsculptor, now in Washington city, and\nMr. Stotesbury, president of the Union\nLeague club of Philadelphia, as well\nBronze Tablet on Pedestal.\nas many othrrs, declare it to ho Hush\nBrown\'s greatest \\vrr!;~---while it\nshould not be tors-oUcn that he has\n-fci.ULSielf devoted vk-u t\'j.n and talent\n(uihu. iiisiii i?>r th?* great ide**ls en.\n1 odied irj the-. noble figure? an\n; nchievi\'iiM-nt of Americ an art that will\nattract the attention of the nation and\n! t! i o world.\nHow Presented.\nJ This statue Ik now the Rift of Col\ni cnel Kd wards to the state of West\ni\nVirginia and her people.
