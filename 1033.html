        <pre>["No. 75.] 87\nTRANSACTIONS\nOF THE\nFACULTY OF ACTUARIES\nInaugural Address—Session 1919-20—by the President, ALFRED\nERNEST SPRAGUE, D.SC. (Edin.), M.A. (Cantab.), Secretary and\nActuary, Edinburgh Assurance Company Limited.\n[Delivered 7th November 1919.]\nAs this is our first Sessional Meeting since the cessation of\nhostilities, I am sure it is your wish that I should in the name of\nthe Faculty extend a hearty welcome to all our returned warriors.\nThere is high authority that a time will come when swords will\nbe beaten into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks, but\nthat time is not yet. The converse is very vividly before our\nminds at the present moment, and none of us will forget the\nalacrity with which our younger members discarded their pens for\nbayonets, nor the extremely efficient use they made of them. We\ncongratulate them on their adaptability, as evidenced by the way\nin which they turned their energies from such mysteries, as, say,\nindefinite integration, to the problem of the definite disintegration\nof the enemy's forces. May the complete success which attended\nthe solution of that problem follow them throughout their\ncivilian careers.\nIn formally announcing the opening of the Session for 1919-20\ntwo tasks fall upon me, the first being easy and pleasant, namely\nto thank you very sincerely for conferring upon me the honour of\noccupying this position which has been held by such eminently\ndistinguished men in previous years. No one can appreciate that\nhonour more deeply, or have the interests of the Faculty more\nVOL. VIII. G\n", '88 Inaugural Address, 1919-20\nsincerely at heart, and it will be my endeavour to advance these\nto the best of any ability I may possess.\nThe second task that confronts me, however, is much more formidable,\nand you will not be surprised that I attempt it with\nconsiderable trepidation, in view of the high level to which you\nhave been accustomed in the Inaugural Addresses of your former\nPresidents. Some thirty years ago, when I was first privileged\nto attend the meetings of the Faculty—or rather of the Actuarial\nSociety of Edinburgh—the feelings of awe and veneration with\nwhich I gazed upon the distinguished President of that time were\nmingled with wonder at his ability not only to choose so appropriate\na subject, but to acquire so wide a knowledge of it, and to\nexpress his thoughts in such aptly chosen words and well-balanced\nsentences. The initial step, that of selecting a subject, is on this\noccasion, and very fortunately for me, one that presents no\ndifficulty, as it is obviously most appropriate that I should deal\nwith some of the aspects of the great War of the past five years\nin relation to our Profession.\nIt is scarcely necessary for me to point out to such an audience,\nsave perhaps to some of the youngest students, that although\nActuarial Science demands an extensive knowledge of mathematics,\nfinance, law and other subjects, the underlying purpose thereof, to\nwhich all else is incidental, is to obtain from past experience a\nguide to the future, the mortality table being perhaps the most\nobvious illustration of this fact. Such a table is deduced entirely\nfrom the recorded experience of past years, and is constantly in\nuse in our daily work as a means of estimating the future\nliabilities under existing assurances, or the premiums that should\nbe charged for new policies. In pursuance of this underlying\npurpose I shall endeavour to set before you, however inadequately,\nsome aspects of the recent struggle and the indications which they\nseem to me to furnish regarding the future; and though I cannot\ndo more than give voice to some of the ideas which have been\npassing through the minds of all, I hope that the mere fact of\ngiving them verbal expression may tend to direct our thoughts\ninto more clearly defined channels, and thereby indirectly help in\nsome small degree towards the solution of the weighty problems\nthat lie before us.\nAmid all the sufferings and tragedies of the war there stands\nforth one tremendous fact, that many millions of men have faced\nindescribable horrors, mutilation and death, not for any personal\ngain but in order that greed, oppression, cruelty, lust and violence\nshould be repressed, and that justice and freedom should be\n', 'Inaugural Address, 1919-20 89\nsecured. In their devotion to the ideal that "Right" should\nprevail against "Might," they were supported by hundreds of\nmillions of men, women and children of all ages, all classes, and\nnearly all nations, and this stupendous moral force is held by\nmany thinkers to have been the essential factor without which\nvictory could not have been achieved. It may be regarded as a\nstriking proof that the world is developing to a higher plane, and\nas strong confirmation of our belief that this development will\ncontinue—slowly, it may be, but certainly—throughout the ages.\nIn particular it should stimulate us all to pursue with fresh ardour\nthe high ideals of professional conduct which the Faculty has\nalways held, and to aim at not merely maintaining those ideals but\nraising them to an even higher standard.\nIn contrast with this, it seems to me incumbent upon each one\nof us to reflect upon the ideals of the Germans and Austrians as\nexhibited in their actions, and the very serious warning which has\nthereby been furnished to the rest of the world. Prior to August\n1914 there were few persons outside those Empires who realised\nthe possibility that a great nation, professedly Christian, and\napparently possessing the attributes of high civilisation, could be\nso lacking in moral sense as to regard its most solemn pledges as\nworthless, and could in the hope of material gain deliberately\nrepudiate every undertaking and disregard every obligation of\nhonour or humanity. Yet this has happened. Every step from\nbeginning to end, from the invasion of Belgium to the scuttling of\nthe German Navy in Scapa Flow, has been characterised by the\nflagrant breach of some solemn undertaking which they had\npledged their honour to fulfil, or of some moral law which is\nrespected by the great majority of mankind. If, as is quite\nprobable, one of us should hereafter be asked to enter into some\nbusiness agreement with a German or Austrian Institution—for\nexample a reassurance treaty—it would be the height of folly to\nignore the manner in which the people of those nations have\nhitherto regarded their undertakings and pledges.\nMuch has been written and said about the mentality of the\nGermans, and the popular explanation of the manner in which\nthey conducted the war seems to be that for forty years or thereby\nthey have been taught systematically that all actions which will\nadvance their interests are not merely justifiable, but patriotic and\nhonourable. This teaching is supposed to have had such an effect\nas to make them believe that there is no moral law governing the\nUniverse, but merely self-interest and brute force, and that they\nare perfectly right to follow " the simple plan, that they should\n', '90 Inaugural Address, 1919-20\ntake who have the power and they should keep who can." But in\nview of the facts is this explanation sufficient? or even plausible ?\nor is there a deeper and more significant reason ? The facts of\nhistory and the study of the evolution of man from his primitive\nstate prove that the great mass of mankind have a more highly\ndeveloped moral sense than their prehistoric ancestors, and that\nraces, like individuals, possess different characteristics and varying\npossibilities of development. May it not be the case that there is\na defect in the Germanic stock which has prevented that race from\ndeveloping their moral sense to the same extent as other nations ?\nA Roman historian is said to have written, nearly two thousand\nyears ago, that of all the peoples in the world the Germanic tribes\nwere the most brutal and treacherous. If his opinion were well\nfounded (and it seems to be consistent with subsequent history)\nthe popular explanation is clearly insufficient to account for the\nfacts, and a very grave prospect is opened up. We know that the\nprocesses of evolution are slow in comparison with the brevity of\nindividual human life, and that a defect in a stock cannot be\neradicated for many generations, nor without a stringent process\nof selection whereby the best specimens are preserved and the\nremainder weeded out. It follows therefore that if the German\nmentality as exhibited during the war be due not to comparatively\nrecent teaching, but to racial characteristics, we cannot reasonably\nexpect any marked change therein until many generations shall\nhave passed away. Regarded in this light, the experience of the\nwar furnishes the rest of the world with the most solemn of warnings\nto neglect no precaution against a renewed effort to establish\nthe ascendancy of physical over moral force.\nA very obvious lesson of the war is the importance of having\nsufficient reserves to withstand every strain which may be experienced\n; and its application to our affairs is equally obvious, though\nit presents no novelty. But it must be remembered that the term\n" reserves " is used in this connection with a very different meaning\nfrom that to which we are accustomed in our Profession. When\ndealing with Insurance questions the word "reserves" is employed\nto denote the fund forming the primary (or sometimes the sole)\nsecurity for an Office\'s liabilities, while in the military sense it\nvirtually means a margin of force available for use as and when\nrequired. If the so-called reserves of an Office were exactly equal\nto the true value of its liabilities there would be no margin whatever\navailable to meet an unexpected contingency, and it is there-\nfore easily seen that our technical use of the word is scarcely\ncorrect, and may even prove misleading to the uninitiated. A\n', 'Inaugural Address, 1919-20 91\ntrue reserve consists of the margin of strength beyond what is\nactually required—not of the total strength—and it is measured\nby the excess which that total exhibits over what is absolutely\nnecessary. I t is analogous to the "factor of safety " which engineers\nintroduce into their calculations when designing bridges or\nother structures. No sane engineer would erect a bridge just strong\nenough to bear the maximum load it will have to sustain, and no\nprudent Actuary would consider his Office to be in a sound position\nif the true value of its funds were exactly equal to the true value\nof its liabilities. Even when (as is not infrequently the case imme\ndiately after a declaration of bonus) the assets are shown as equal\nto the estimated value of the liabilities, there is almost always a\nsubstantial margin. The assets are usually written down to somewhat\nbelow their real value, the liabilities are almost always valued\nat a lower rate of interest than the Office is earning or likely to\nearn, and other margins exist in the rates of mortality employed\nin the calculations and the provisions made for future expenses.\nOwing to the foresight and wisdom displayed in the management\nof Insurance Offices these margins have been conserved, and from\ntime to time increased to an extent which has enabled the Offices\nto meet the unexampled strain of the past five years. In spite of\nunprecedented depreciation in their assets, taxation that was\nundreamed of before the war, and the heavy burden due to excessive\nrates of mortality, Life Assurance Policies have remained\ngood security for their face values, while almost every other form\nof investment has depreciated very largely. This is a record of\nwhich we all may well be proud, though the credit belongs largely\nto those who went before us and laid the foundations on such sound\nlines. We must also remember, above all, that there is imposed\nupon us the sacred duty of maintaining and even exalting the high\nstandard that they set up. In these days when there is much talk\nof the extension of business on the non-participating plan, it is\nwell to remember that the margins which we speak of as the\nsources of future bonuses really form our chief " factor of safety."\nIf a Life Office had assets exactly equal to its liabilities calculated\nat the rates of mortality, interest, and expense which it will\nexperience, it could earn no profits, because every penny it\nreceived would be required to meet its liabilities, and there would be\nno margin whatever. The happening of any adverse event which\nhad not been anticipated and provided for would cause insolvency.\nConsequently, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that these sources\nof future bonuses are not tampered with. In like manner if the\nrates of premium for new assurances were based on the true rates\n', '92 Inaugural Address, 1919-20\nof interest, mortality and expense, the business transacted on that\nfooting could never yield any profit, nor could it ever add to the\nstrength of the office. On the contrary, each additional transaction\nwould weaken the position, because it would increase the\nassets by no more than it increased the liabilities, and the existing\nmargin of strength would be spread over a wider area, thus\nactually decreasing the factor of safety over the total business.\nFor this reason I would earnestly impress upon those who are at\nthe commencement of their careers, the necessity of allowing an\nadequate margin in all their calculations of premiums and policy\nvalues. They will probably have to face an almost continual\npressure to reduce rates of premium to, if not below, the level of\nthe lowest quotation by any other Office ; and they will frequently\nbe asked the question, " If our competitor can afford to do business\nat such a rate, why cannot we do so ?" In one form or another\nthat question has been put to me scores of times, and no doubt\nother Actuaries have had, and will continue to have, a similar\nexperience. Probably they will also on some occasion be tempted\nto increase their rate of bonus by cutting down the factor of\nsafety ; and they are likely to meet with strenuous opposition if\nthey should think it advisable at some valuation to reduce or even\nto pass a bonus. In all such difficulties let them reflect upon the\nlesson taught us at such fearful cost during the last five years,\nthat an adequate margin of strength is a vital necessity ; and let\nthem use all their influence and all their courage to hold to the\nprinciple which is briefly expressed in the well-known phrase\n"safety first." The business of life assurance is so widespread\nand so essential to the well-being of many thousands of our fellowcitizens,\nthat an Actuary who allows his margins to be reduced to\nnear the danger point may cause a disaster comparable with the\nloss of a great battle, thereby incurring a responsibility commensurate\nwith that of a General who by neglect of his duty has\ncaused such a loss.\nAnother point which has received great emphasis is the importance\nof unity of command. I t has been vividly impressed upon\nus that in order to direct to the best advantage our own forces and\nthose of our Allies it was essential to entrust the supreme command\nto one man ; and this military truth holds good in other\nspheres, including our own. In the management of Insurance\nOffice\'s, no less than in the control of armies in the field, divided\ncounsels always involve loss of efficiency ; and for this reason the\nManager should have the power to direct the activities of all his\nStaff. It is conceivable that he may on some occasion propose to\n', "Inaugural Address, 1919–20 93\nadopt a course which one of the other officials believes to be wrong,\nand in such a case that official's duty is clear. He should inform\nthe Manager of the objections he sees to the course proposed ; and\nhe will probably find that these have already been considered, and\nare outweighed by advantages in other directions which he bad\nnot foreseen. It may happen, however, in an extreme case that he\nremains convinced that his objections are so well founded and so\nserious that the course proposed is unjustifiable. In that case he\nwould be in a very difficult position, for he must either carry out\nthe instructions he has received, although he believes the course\nto be wrong, or he must set himself in direct opposition thereto,\nand insist that his objections be laid before the Board of Directors\n—which may involve his professional ruin, if the Board decide\nagainst him. Fortunately such a case must rarely if ever arise,\nthough there is one well known event in Naval History which\naffords a striking illustration of the difficulty—namely the sinking of\nH.M.S. Victoria in the Mediterranean in the year 1893. The Admiral\nin command of a squadron of ships proceeding in two parallel lines\ngave the order for a manœuvre, which, if executed, would inevitably\nlead to a series of collisions, involving every one of the ships.\nThe subordinate officers, whose duty it was to execute the order,\npointed out to the Admiral that the distance between the two\nparallel lines was too small for the manœuvre to be executed,\nbut the Admiral, owing to some inexplicable misunderstanding,\ninsisted on his order being carried out. The result was that the\nleading pair of ships collided, the Victoria being sunk with some\n350 of her complement, and the Camperdown seriously damaged,\nwhile the remaining ships turned aside instead of completing the\nmanœuvre, thus avoiding the further collisions which would otherwise\nhave taken place. The Court Martial which inquired into\nthe disaster held that the subordinate officers had acted rightly\nin obeying the order ; though there were indications of a feeling\nthat a stronger or more explicit objection to the order might have\nbeen made. In that particular case a simple diagram would\nhave proved instantly, and with mathematical certainty, that the\nmanœuvre, if completed, would immediately wreck the whole\nsquadron ; but the consequences of an error in, the management\nof an Assurance Office can seldom, if ever, be predicted with\nsimilar ease and certainty, and the full effects cannot appear\nuntil many years have elapsed. The general conclusion to be\ndrawn is that a subordinate official in an analogous difficulty\nshould (after stating his views and being over-ruled) loyally carry\nout the orders of his Manager, save in the extreme case of his\n", '94 Inaugural Address, 1919-20\nbeing thoroughly sure of his ground, and convinced that a serious\nerror is being made. In that event he would do well to seek\nadvice of the wisest and most experienced man of business whom\nhe knows, and it is probable that a way out of his difficulty may\nthen be suggested to him.\nAnother striking feature of the war is the remarkable illustration\nit affords of the principle that in the struggle for existence\nthose organisms which can best adapt themselves to their environment\nhave an advantage over those which are less adaptable.\nThis is, of course, one of the fundamental principles of evolution ;\nand it is not limited to the province of the naturalist, but extends\nalso to struggles between nations. We have seen an extremely\nrapid development in almost every branch of science and industry\nfor the purpose of adapting ourselves to meet new dangers and\nforms of attack. On land and sea, in the air, under the sea, and\neven under the land, new weapons of offence and defence have\nbeen invented and applied in vast numbers ; and there can be no\ndoubt that the final success which crowned the efforts of ourselves\nand our Allies was largely due to our power of adapting ourselves\nto meet and overcome the new methods of attack from overhead\nand under water which were employed so unscrupulously and\nruthlessly by the Central Empires. Had it not been for the\nmeasure of success which attended our efforts to meet submarine\nattacks, and to obtain supremacy of the air, the war would in all\nprobability have had a different ending. The same principle also\nholds good in the domain of Assurance ; and that Office which is\nbest able to adapt itself to the varying needs of the public and\nthe changing circumstances of the times, possesses an advantage\nover its competitors which will show itself in greater prosperity\nand more rapid progress. For this reason it is plainly our duty\nto keep ourselves familiar with the latest developments of Actuarial\nScience, and to make a critical study of the systems in use in our\nvarious Offices, in order that we may remedy defects and introduce\nimprovements from time to time. There is always a tendency for\nus to rest satisfied with a system which is working well, instead\nof inquiring whether it could be made to work better ; and to\ndelay making any alteration until the time when such alteration\nis obviously necessary ; but if a change would be advantageous,\nthe sooner it is made the better will it be for the Office, and to\npostpone it until the last possible moment simply means the loss\nof an advantage that would otherwise have been gained. In this\nconnection it is useful to remember that human intelligence is\nincapable of devising a perfect system which will remain perfect\n', "Inaugural Address, 1919-20 95\nfor all time, and therefore it is practically certain that improvements\nare always possible to us if we possess sufficient intelligence\nto see them, and sufficient energy to adopt them.\nAt the present time we are having forced upon our attention\nthe financial and economic after-effects of the war in the shape of\nheavy taxation, and a huge indebtedness to foreign countries\nwith consequent adverse exchanges and high prices; and the\nmost earnest appeals are being made to the nation to increase the\nproduction of commodities, in order that by their export we may\nreduce our debt, and once more place our finances in a sound\nposition. Although our business, while essential, is not productive,\nand therefore we cannot respond directly to this appeal,\nyet we can all help to attain the desired object by devoting\nourselves more earnestly to our daily work, and endeavouring to\nincrease our efficiency therein. During the war there were many\nwho, though unfit for active service owing to physical disability,\nyet played a worthy part by filling the place of another who was\nthereby set free to join the forces in the field. In like manner\ni t is within our power to help forward the great movement of\nnational reconstruction, by increasing our output of work. The\neffect in an individual case would of course be inappreciable,\nbecause most of us are already doing a good day's work with\nregularity, so that it is a physical impossibility to make any large\naddition thereto ; but the sum total of a united effort would be\nrepresented by increased speed in the transaction of business,\nwith consequent saving of valuable time. Fewer additions would\nrequire to be made to the staffs of the Offices, thus virtually\nsetting free a number of men whose energies could be directed\ninto other channels, with the ultimate result that a slightly\ngreater proportion of the Nation's energies could be devoted\nto the production of commodities. This thought should be a\nstimulus to each one of us, as the most monotonous or even\ndistasteful work assumes a new interest when one realises that\nit contributes directly to the National Welfare. Those who have\nread the recent statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\ncan scarcely fail to be deeply impressed with the urgent necessity\nthat all classes should exert themselves to meet our changed\neconomic situation. Unless we succeed in adapting ourselves\nthereto—and apparently this can only be done by a general\nincrease in efficiency coupled with harder work—we shall certainly\nfurnish to the world a striking example of the law that\nthat organism which in the struggle for existence fails to adapt\nitself to its environment is forced under by others.\n", '96 Inaugural Address, 1919-20\nThere is yet another valuable lesson we may gather from the\nWar, namely, that success was attained by the co-operation of\nmillions, both men and women, of greater or less importance,\ndevoting their energies to the common aim. It was not due\nentirely to the genius of one great leader, bat to the combined\nefforts of all ; and each one contributed a share, greater or less\naccording to his or her abilities and opportunities, towards the\nultimate victory. In like manner, the business in which most of\nus find our life\'s work represents the combined efforts of all who\nare engaged in it, and every one, from the General Manager to\nthe youngest office boy (or girl) contributes something towards\nthe total. The great contributions of those few whose genius\nenables them to effect a striking improvement naturally attract\nmost attention, ana are apt to cause us to overlook or attach too\nlittle value to the minor contributions of the many which are\nequally necessary to the success of the whole. Each one ought\nto keep in view the fact that he or she has the power to do useful\nwork, and to help in the great campaign which we are waging\nagainst distress and poverty. In Gulliver\'s Travels it is pointed\nout that any one who makes two blades of grass grow where\nformerly there was only one is a benefactor to humanity, and the\nsame may be said of any one who makes the smallest addition to\nour knowledge of Actuarial Science or the slightest improvement\nin the system by which it is applied. We cannot all achieve such\ngreat things as the invention, say, of a better method of valuing\nendowment assurance policies, or the writing of a standard " Text\nBook "; but in numerous directions there are vast opportunities\nopen to each of us for performing work less notable, though in its\nown degree important. For example, the shelves of our Library\nare crowded with books containing great numbers of original\ninvestigations, and the knowledge embodied therein is somewhat\ndifficult of access to, and of assimilation by, our students. This\nis natural, and indeed inevitable, because an original investigation\nresembles the track hewed through a virgin forest by a pioneer,\nwhich though practicable is necessarily rough and tortuous, leaving\nmany difficulties for those who follow in his steps. It is not until\nmany have passed that the roughnesses are removed, the bends\nstraightened, and the track made into a broad and smooth highway.\nA great deal has been achieved by the improved indexing\nof the existing papers, but much more could be accomplished by\nrevisal and simplification of the demonstrations given therein, with\nthe excision of irrelevant matter, or that which has been rendered\nsuperfluous by later investigations. The Institute of Actuaries\n', "Inaugural Address, 1919-20 97\nhave for a number of years past encouraged work of this description\nby their Students' Society, which has already achieved and\npublished very valuable results. These publications are of great\nvalue to all Actuarial Students, and a number of copies have\nbeen added to the Library for the convenience of those who are\npreparing themselves for the Faculty's Examinations. References\nare made to them in the recently published List of Reading\nrecommended for Parts III. and IV., which list is in itself a piece of\nwork of such high value that the heartiest thanks of the Faculty\nare due to those gentlemen who sacrificed much of their scanty\nleisure and spared neither time nor trouble in compiling it. But\nthe Faculty could with advantage go a great deal further in the\nsame direction ; and instead of practically confining its proceedings\nand publications to original work of notable and obvious importance,\nit might also help towards the simplification and codification\nof the results already obtained. I hope that it may be possible to\narouse sufficient interest and secure enough support to carry to a\nsuccessful issue a project which has already been mooted, namely,\nthe formation of some society or organisation among our junior\nmembers and students which will lead them to take a more active\npart in the work of the Faculty. From past experience I know\nthat it appears to a student a very formidable matter to take part\nin one of our discussions. His difficulty is largely due to the fact\nthat, as a rule, he has never had occasion to make a public speech\nof any kind, even in such a friendly atmosphere as prevails in\nthis hall, where nearly all of us are personally known to one\nanother, and where the speaker is sure of an attentive, considerate,\nand forbearing audience. This difficulty could easily be removed\nby very little practice in discussions of a more informal and\nelementary character than usually take place at our Meetings, and\nI venture to suggest that pending the formation of a Students'\nSociety the Faculty might arrange for some short lectures on\nsimple questions of professional or general interest—open to\nStudents only, or possibly to Students and Junior Fellows—\nfollowed by informal discussions. This would afford to beginners\nthe opportunity of accustoming themselves to speak in public,\nand would incidentally help to train them in quickness of thought,\naccuracy of reasoning and clearness of expression, and the results\nwould make themselves manifest in the wider interest and freer\ndiscussions which would attend our regular meetings.\nWe have been made aware through countless dispatches, books,\nand articles in the public press of the high value—indeed of the\nabsolute necessity—of a good intelligence department, and we all\n", '98 Inaugural Address, 1919-20\nknow that the success of any manœuvre or engagement depends\nlargely on accurate information being obtained as to the dispositions\nand movements of the enemy. The skilful commander\ndeduces from such information the probable intentions of the\nenemy, and lays his plans to frustrate these, or to gain an advantage\nby attacking the most vulnerable point. There is a very\nclose analogy between this and any other science, including our\nown. Each step in advance is gained by observing and recording\nfacts with as much accuracy as can be secured, and deducing conclusions\ntherefrom which may serve as a guide to further progress.\nAs a rule, it is impossible to secure absolutely accurate observations;\nand even if this were practicable, it would frequently be by no\nmeans easy to deduce sound conclusions: therefrom, because it is\nseldom the case that one is able to state with certainty that all\npossible causes have been taken into account in the process of\nreasoning by which the conclusions are reached. Workers in the\nfield of Actuarial Science have for generations been engaged in\ncollecting and examining statistics bearing upon rates of mortality;\nbut, as we all know, those statistics contain numerous possible\nsources of error notwithstanding the most careful precautions\ntaken to exclude them, and the very best mortality tables can\nonly be regarded as approximations to the truth. Furthermore,\nthe results of successive investigations have shown that the rates\nof mortality are by no means fixed, but are constantly varying.\nIt seems fairly well established that both assured lives and\nannuitants have on the whole during the last century been subject\nto slowly decreasing rates of mortality, and that this is part of a\ngeneral tendency for the progress of civilisation to increase the\nduration of human life. But whether this tendency will continue\nis a question that we are unable to answer with certainty; and\nmuch less are we able to predict the extent of future variations in\nthe rates. Consequently, when we are asked to calculate tables\nof premiums, or reserves for liabilities dependent on the future\nduration of human life, we are lacking in the first essential,\nnamely, accurate information. The data are only approximate,\nand although the mathematical processes by which we deduce the\nrequired premiums or reserves are rigidly correct, the results are\nat best mere approximations. The calculation of Life Assurance\npremiums to the degree of accuracy represented by a difference of\none penny in the premium for an assurance of £100 is as a rule quite\nunwarranted by the degree of accuracy possessed by the mortality\ntables upon which the calculation is based, although it is convenient\nand even desirable to publish tables of premiums in this form for the\n', 'Inaugural Address, 1919-20 99\npurpose of avoiding irregularities in the rates. When it isremembered\nthat not only are the rates of mortality mere approxi-\nmations, but the future rates of interest and the future costs of\nmanagement are even more uncertain, it is quite clear that the\ninformation afforded by our professional "Intelligence Department"\ncannot be implicitly depended upon. Like the prudent\ncommander we must therefore provide against inaccuracies, and\nleave a margin for the errors which we know must exist therein,.\nthough we cannot estimate their magnitude with any approach toaccuracy.\nThe young student is perhaps rather apt to suppose\nthat since ours is a mathematical or "exact" science, the standard\ntables we use are mathematically accurate; but the popular phrase\n" exact science " is in fact a misnomer in every case where science\ndeals with the facts of nature. Those facts can never be observed\nwith rigid accuracy, although very high degrees of approximation\nhave already been obtained in many directions—notably in\nastronomy—and improvements are constantly being effected.\nThere is a story told of a former King of Scotland who heard the\nlearned men of his day engaged in a dispute as to the reason why\na bucket full to the brim with water did not overflow when a live\nfish was dropped into it. After hearing their arguments and\nthe elaborate theories propounded in explanation of the phenomenon,\nhe remarked, " But is it a fact ?" and he insisted that a\nbucketful of water be produced and a live fish put into it—thereby\nproving, of course, that the supposed phenomenon was a myth.\nThis little story has always struck me as a good illustration of the\nessence of science—that the first requisite is accurate observation,\nso that the foundation upon which reason erects its superstructuremay\nbe as secure as is humanly possible. Science has progressed\nfar since then, and observations are conducted with such care that\nthe simple question "Is it a fact?" is generally replaced by "How\nclose an approximation is it ?" or " How small is the error ?" but\nwe should never forget the existence of that error however smallit\nmay be, and should always allow a sufficient margin to cover it.\nThere is one other point which I would impress particularly\nupon the younger members of the Faculty, namely, the importance\nof physical culture and development, and observance of the- laws\nof health. Those who have studied the training of recruits for\nthe army (and there must be very few, if any, of us who have not\nsome knowledge of the subject) cannot fail to be struck with the\nextreme care that was taken in the matter of physical development\nand the preservation of health. Although great strength of\nmuscle and sinew is not essential to the calling of an Actuary,\n', '100 Inaugural Address 1919-20\nyet physical health is necessary to the full development and use\nof the mental faculties required by our profession. A sedentary\nlife is not the most conducive to health; and hard study in the\nevenings, after a day of office work, involves considerable strain.\nIt is therefore important that students should take full advantage\nof such opportunities as are open to them for physical\nrecreation and open-air sports. This theme is somewhat beyond\nthe scope of the objects of the Faculty; but I am not without\nhope that at some future date, when the growth of our membership\nrequires larger premises, it may be found possible to acquire\na building which will afford sufficient accommodation to permit of\nour forming some organisation whose object would be social as\nwell as professional, and whose activities would include the\nformation of gymnastic and other athletic clubs. A development\nIn such a direction could scarcely fail to produce beneficial results\nto the profession, as the improvement which it would effect upon\nthe physique of the members would lead to greater vigour\nin mental processes, and a higher level of efficiency in all directions.\nThe war has also proved the means of effecting, or perhaps\nmerely expediting, what bids fair to prove an epoch-making\nchange in our whole social and economic system. I refer to the\nsuccessful employment of vast numbers of women in many spheres,\nwhich were formerly regarded as falling entirely within the\nprovince of the male sex. The manner in which they carried out\nduties of an exacting nature, involving not only mental qualifications\nof a high order but also physical strength and endurance in\nconsiderable degree, has proved their capacity to undertake a far\nwider part in the work of the world. Minor incidents of this\ngreat change are exhibited in the recent alterations of our rules,\nwhereby women may be admitted to Membership of the Faculty;\nand in the Diploma in Actuarial Mathematics recently instituted\nby the University of Edinburgh, which is also open to women\nstudents. As it takes several years to complete the necessary\ntraining and obtain the full professional qualifications of an\nActuary, and as the number of women students will be small for\nsome time to come, those of my own sex who are at the outset of\ntheir careers need not fear damage to their prospects on account\nof the additional competition thus introduced, and I do not doubt\nthat the admission of women will be justified by the results—as\nwas the case during the war—and that it will prove an additional\nsource of strength to the Faculty.\nThere is one other subject which I introduce somewhat diffi-\n', 'Inaugural Address 1919-20 101\ndently, namely, Captain Bruce Bairnsfather\'s world-famous creation\nknown as "Ole Bill." I refer to him not because of any classical\nbeauty in his features, but because he is symbolic of that wonderful\nspirit possessed by our troops, which enabled them to bear their\ngreat and long-continued hardships, and in the end to emerge with\nsuccess from the struggle. That faculty of wholesome wit and\ncheerful optimism which " Ole Bill" symbolises, was an invaluable\nasset of our armies; and even though the main driving forces of\ncivilisation may be high ideals, backed by a stern sense of duty\nand discipline, there is no doubt that humour, properly exercised,\nis a valuable lubricant which makes the wheels go round more\nsmoothly. Therefore, even in our serious calling it is desirable\nthat we should remember we are human beings, possessing a sense\nof humour.\nThe experiences through which the world has passed since\nAugust 1914, must yield lessons of-incalculable value, and no one\ncan be more conscious than I am that these fragmentary remarks\nbarely touch the fringe of so vast a theme. Each one who considers\nthe subject will probably look at it from a slightly different\nstandpoint and arrive at somewhat different conclusions, but probably\nthere will be general agreement that some of the more\nimportant lessons may be epitomised thus:—that we should consistently\nendeavour to use all our faculties to observe accurately,\nall our intellect to deduce accurate conclusions from observed\nfacts, and all our energies to work enthusiastically in the great and\nage-long struggle for the advancement of humanity.\nMr. GEORGE M. LOW—Gentlemen—on this occasion I am happy to say\nLadies and Gentlemen—You will allow me, I hope, in your name and my\nown to express to Dr. Sprague how extremely gratified we feel at having\nhim in the chair which he now occupies. The son of a father highly distinguished\nin our profession, he has by his own work and his own attain-\nments taken a very high place among actuaries We welcome him on that\naccount, we welcome him for his personal qualities, and we are proud to\nhave him at the head of this Faculty at so very interesting a period in its\nhistory. We have just emerged, as he has reminded us, from one of the\ngreat catastrophes of time, and we are now about to set ourselves to the\ndifficult task of reorganising, with a view to regaining something like the\nordinary course of our affairs. It is fortunate for us that at such a\ntime we have at our head a man of such ability as Dr. Sprague. I\nwould also wish, in your name, to thank him for the address which he\nhas just delivered to us. Considering his scientific acquirements, some\nof us may have rather dreaded that he would plunge us beyond our\ndepth in an address on such an occasion as this. Instead of that he\n', '102 Inaugural Address 1919-20\nhas given us a highly interesting and suggestive address, based upon\nlessons which, as he has shown us, are to be deduced from the catastrophe\nthat has now come to an end, or nearly come to an end, and\nthat may be applied with advantage in the practice of our own profession.\nHe has also thrown out certain very valuable suggestions for the future conduct\nof the Faculty, and for bringing the younger men more into touch with\nthe practical working of such a body as this. For these we are grateful to\nhim, and we hope that under his presidency he may see accomplished\nsome of those objects he has put before us. I beg to move a very cordial\nvote of thanks to Dr. Sprague for his presence here, and for the address\nhe has given us.\n']</pre>
