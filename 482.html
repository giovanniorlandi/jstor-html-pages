Anderson went out for a day\'s\nshooting. Finding a Jion at. short dis\ntanee he fired and the shot grazed\nthe animal\'s skull, slightly wounding\nIt. The Infuriated beast leaped upon\nthe ofllcer, throwing him to the\nground, and hit him through the knee\njust as ho fired a rharge from his\ndouble-barreled sporting rifl,> through\nits head. The aninuil continued to\nclaw and bite him; while Lieut. Ander\nson, fli\'hling for his life, clubbed the\nlion with the bult end of the rifle.\nAll the while blood was streaming\nfrom the wounds of the lion, which\nwas of unusual size.\nThe native servant, although prac\ntically unarmed, rushed to the aid of\nhis injured master, and at length the\nanimal, exhausted from the loss of\nI blood, slunk away. leaving Lieut An\nI derson almost overcome and in a very\n1 precarious condition.\nSubsequently the lion was found\ndead at a little distance from the\nscene of the encounter.

George Forrest, an English\ntraveler, thus describes the chief\nweapon of these people:\n"If I had to suggest a title for a\nbook on the upper Salwin I should\ncall It "The Land of the Crossbow,\'\nwhich is the characteristic weapon of\nthe country and the Lissoo tribe.\n"Every Lissoo with any pretensions\nto chic possesses at least two of these\nweapons ? one for everyday use in\nhunting and the other for war.

If you wish\nto delight the heart of a newly en\ngaged girl and in\nsure her tlie best\nof luck send your\nc o n g r a t ulatory\nflowers to her in\n* white heather\nloving cup. These\ncups are Scotch,\nwhere on the\nmoors the lovely\niifainor prows, and every Scotch\nlassie knows well the old tradition\nthat a bit of heather is sure to bring\nher luck.\nThe foundation cf this interesting\ncup is of birch bark, quite hidden by\ndelicate festoons of the feathery\nheather, also closely entwined about\nthe large handle projecting on one\nside in graceful lines." An inner re\nceptacle of metal holds vater for\nflowers, which, to most artistically set\noff the cup, should be pink roses or\nfarnations. as that color is so lovely\nin combination with the gray tinge of\nthe heather.\nme lucky possessor of one of these\nlucky cups ran convert it at any time\ninto a loving cup by lining a glass re\nceptacle inside, instr,?d of the metal\n| one, and as the heatnar, which has\nbeen dried to use in this form, will\nkeep forever the girl can bring it out\non all sorts of fesi\'ve occasions and.\nusing it for a drinking cup. share its\npotent cliarni with her friends.\nA|.-p et i z. rj Sea Pic. ?

That is the issue that will con\ntinue in this country when these poor\ntongues of Judge Douglas and myself\nshall be silent. They are two principles\nthat have stood face to face from the\nlteginning of time and will ever con\ntinue to struggle. The one is the\nc immon right of humanity and the\nother is the divine right of kings.\nTt is the same principle- in whatever\nshape it develops itself. It is the same\nspirit that says: \'You work and toil\nand earn bread and I will eat it.\' I ask\nyou if it is not a false philosophy? Is\nit not a false statesmanship that under\ntakes to build a system of policy upon\nthe basis of curing nothing about the\nvery thing that everybody does care the\nmost aljout?"\nThe principle of the common right of\nhumanity is just as applicable to the\ngreat issues of the day as it was to the\n<liiestions before the war. The issue\nnow is whether there shall l?e govern\nment by and for the people or by and\nfor money and privilege.\nIt is the principle of the square deal;\nof equal opportunities to all and special\nprivileges to none.\nA POLITICAL SENSATION\nAs might 1m? expected the removal of\niStut-o Engineer Nicholas from office by\n< Governor Dickerson has caused a\npolitical sensation and all sorts of\ncharges are being made, both against\nthe doposed official and the Governor.\nAs yet no definite statement has been\nmade by either of the principals both\nclaiming that they have been faithfnl\nto the duties of their respective offices.\nThat a complete investigation of the\naffair will result is a certainty and the\n.truth will be known. Dickerson states\n.that he acted after a reasonable amount\n.of time had l>een given for the doposed\nofficial to explain his actions in the\nDuckwater case and Nicholas still\nmaintains that he never was given a\nchance to explain. The matter, at the\npresent, rests here, but at an early date\nthe facts in the case must of necessity\nI?h made known and when that time\ncomes judgmont can be passed in a\nconservative manner. ?

Their ex\nample was followed by bands of poor\nI students.\' known as Bacchantes. These\nBacchantes wandered from one uni\nversity to another in search of better\ninstruction or better means of sup\nport. Such a wandering life was fa\nvored by the customs of times when\npeople thought it a virtue to give free\nly to all persons seeking help, but\nespecially to monks and students.\nThe Bacphantes had with them\nyounger traveling scholars known as\nskirmishers, who were to receive in\nstruction in return for certain services.\n[The younger skirmisher had to wait\nupon his Bacchante, beg, and even\nsteal for him, and for the most part\nhe was very tyrannically used. But\nas he was a waif without other protec\ntion he had to make the best of mat\nters.\nAfter the reformation In many\nplaces these orphan hoys, or waifs,\nwere banded into organized choirs,\nwho received pay from churches, hut\nalso were assisted by private sub\nscriptions. It was their duty to sing\nnot only in the churches, but before\nthe houses of their patrons as well.\nThus they ceased to be beggars. Mar\ntin Luther himself as a boy had been\none of these singers, and it was large- j\nly due to his influence that the old .\ncustom of begging entirely passed J\naway. There is a famous picture of\nLuther as a singing boy In Eisenach\nwhere his song attracted the attention\nof the go^d Frau Cotta. who adopted\nand edi\'?nted blm.\nNowadays the old custom of the\nchoir boys\' singing from house to\nhouse Is fading away.
