        <pre>['BOOK P.EVIEWS 225\npreparing a book on land problems. Dr. Gray\'s work was made\navailable to the authors through his widow, and they have used\nit as the basis for their book which takes into account the vast\nsocial and economic changes which have taken place since the\n1930\'s and which have affected the significance of Dr. Gray\'s\nstudies in that decade.\nThe book gives systematic treatment to the following aspects of\nthe subject: effects of English and Colonial precedents on our land\npolicies; summary of our land disposal policies; discussion of the\nproblems o£ land settlement, land evaluation, land requirements\nand land management, and the problems of land reform. Land\neconomics, in general, is treated and presented as a dynamic\nbranch of social science. \'\nAGRICULTURAL POLICY\nBy Rainer Schickele. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co. 453\npages. 1954. $6.50.\n"Farm Programs and National Welfare" is the subtitle to this\nexceptionally well written book which presents a good defense of\nthe need for governmental policy with respect to agriculture and\nthe national economy. A positive relationship between programs\nand national welfare is implicit in the subtitle, and the author\npresents both the potentialities and the limitations of government\naction in farm problems. The book is written, says the\nauthor in the preface, "for anyone who is curious to understand\nwhat problems farmers are facing in their relations to an industrial\nworld, and what the government is doing to help them meet\nthese problems." That such help is not only desirable but necessary\nis considered to be one of the economic facts of life today.\nThe author, chairman of the agricultural economics department\nat North Dakota Agricultural College, holds that agricultural\nproblems today are problems of national political economy; and\nfrom this clearly stated point of view, he analyzes the problems\nof farm policy in five major parts, viz.:policy making in a free\nsociety; evaluation of ends, means and consequences of agricultural\npolicy; programs for improving resource allocation (pro-\nduction credit, soil conservation, forest and range management,\netc.); farm price policy, and programs for improving income\ndistribution.\nSOILS AND LAND OF MICHIGAN\nBy J. O. Veach, East Laming: The Michigan State College Press.\n241 pages. 136 illus. 1 map. 1953. f7.50.\nThe natural character of the land surface of Michigan in association\nwith varying social, economic and political conditions, and\nits influence on land utilization is the subject of this interesting\nbook. It is based on long and critical study of the area by one of\nAmerica\'s ablest soil scientists and ecologists. General descriptions\nof the physiography, vegetation, parent rocks, slope and relief of\nthe state are presented in the first quarter of the book. The relationships\nof these factors to the physical and chemical properties\nof the soils are outlined in the chapter on pedology. This section\nshould be valuable to everyone interested in soils of the Great\nLakes Region, Podzol and Gray Brown Podzolic areas elsewhere\nin the world, or in the natural geography of this area as part of a\nnational or world picture. It summarizes many of the author\'s\nunique contributions to the terminology of soil science.\nThe central two-fourths of the text describe the combinations\nof all the above natural features of the landscape. The relation of\nnatural limitations to the potentialities and utility of each area\nare skillfully interwoven. In the final quarter of the book, Prof.\nVeatch discusses objectively the geopolitical implications of the\nnatural geography of the area. These are then used as a background\nfor his predictions of future land use trends and poten-\ntialities. He estimates that Michigan has more than 30 million\nacres of potentially arable land. This figure is astonishing when\ncompared to the 12 million tillable acres now in farms, and the>\nfact that only about 8 million acres are used annually for harvested\ncrops. In recognition of its monumental nature, the Michi-\ngan Agricultural Experiment Station has designated this book\nas No. 7 in its Memoir Series. — E. P. WHITESIDE.\nSERGEI N. WINOGRADSKY\nHIS LIFE AND WORK\nBy Selman A. Waksman. New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rutgers\nUniversity Press. 150 pages. 1953. $4.00.\nDr. Waksman has performed a real service in reviewing the\nlife, personality and achievements of this great bacteriologist. No\nother American, and certainly few, if any, present-day European\nscientists, knew Winogradsky so intimately. The friendship of\nthese two scholars was kindled by mutual interests and endeavors;\neach contributed voluminously to the rise and development of\nsoil microbiology as an independent science. Other sympathetic\nbonds, in addition to their native Russian backgrounds, encouraged\nan active correspondence between them over a period of 30\nyears. In consequence, this volume is an impressive memorium to\na friend and worthy colleague.\nWaksman\'s biography of Winogradsky is a panoramic portrayal\nof a brilliant scientist who, despite hardships, world con-\nflicts and ill health maintained a solidarity of purpose to become\na leader in his field. The organization of the volume merits high\ncommendation; Its text material should appeal especially to those\nbacteriologists who aspire to become better acquainted with the\nhistory of their science and its founders. The introductory section,\n"As I Saw Him", consists of recollections by Waksman of\nhis first visit to Winogradsky\'s home and laboratory outside of\nParis in early May, 1924. Two sections: I. Winogradsky: The Man\nand the Scientist, and II. Winogradsky and the Scientific World,\nfollow with a coverage of 86 pages of carefully compiled historical\ninformation. Although these two sections cover in large part Dr.\nWaksman\'s paper in Soil Science, vol. 62, pp. 197-226, 1946, this\nrepetition is well justified in this separate volume. The third\nsection comprises letters and excerpts from a voluminous .correspondence\nto Waksman from Winogradsky. Through these per-\nsonalia the reader learns of the difficulties in compiling and publishing\nWinogradsky\'s collected works in 1949, Winogradsky\'s\nsorrows and privations wrought by sickness and war during World\nWar II, and his ever-sensitive evaluation of the papers being\ncurrently published in soil bacteriology. A few informal snapshots\nand an excellent portrait photograph of Winogradsky en-\nrich the book.\nBiographies of this quality are indispensable on the bookshelf\nof the bacteriologist and the soil scientist. — O. N. ALLEN\nPublished April, 1954\n']</pre>
