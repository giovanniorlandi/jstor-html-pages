        <pre>['[THE ALASKA DAILY EMPIRE, VOL. X NO. 64. JUNEAU, ALASKA, SATURDAY, JANUARY 18, 1913. PRICE TEN CENTS, \' j, BAD FEELING DEVELOPS IN SENATE, City Buys Property for, Cold Storage Plant, Last night\'s meeting of the cit>, council was one of the most interest, ing sessions in many weeks., Many citizens were present having, been induced to come through the in, vitation extended by the city govern, ment to take part in the discussion, of a cold storage contract with the, Juneau Fish and Ice Company. Emer>, Valentine. J. F. Malony. J. K. McKan, na. H. P. Crowther. Jas. Fitzgerald, and Oliver Orange were among those, present and took part in the discus, sions of the evening., Mayor Bishop being absent from, the city. Acting Mayor Miller was in, the chair. Councilmen Wolland. Bell., Freis and Femmer answered to roil, call. The first matter of importance, to receive attention was the necess, ary action on a resolution passed pro, viding for the purchase of two dis, tinct tracts of water frontage adjoin, ing the City dock and on which the, City expected to have the proposed, cold storage plant erected., It was discovered during the prog, ress of the meeting that title to one, of the tracts was in dispute. James, Fitzgerald, who was present in the, name of Mrs. Fitzgerald claimed a, certain portion of the tract farthest, from the dock. This brought forth, a spicy exchange of pleasantries be, tween ex-Mayor Valentine and Mr., Fitzgerald. After considerable dis, cussion this new obstruction to the, city\'s scheme, the city council segre, gated the tracts to be purchased and, passed an affirmative vote on the res, olution providing for the purchase of, ? the Billy Layton tract immediately, adjoining the City dock. This tract, is 38 feet wide. In order to complete, the plans it will not be necessary to, get possession of the other 20 feet., Judge Malonv urged the council to, proceed saying that the city could go, ahead and take the property in dis, pute by getting options from all par, , ties in dispute and allow the money, to be paid to the real owner after the, dispute had been settled amongst, J themselves or by the court All of, the disputants seemed satisfied with, this arrangement. The title is to be, investigated and reported on at a, subsequent meeting., The proposed contract with the Ju, neau Fish and Ice Company for the, erection of the cold storage plant was, introduced by councilman Bell and, went through its first reading. Act, ing-Mayor Miller called for expres, sions from the citizens present and, remarks were made by Emery Val, entine. H. P. Crowther. Oliver Drange, Judge Malony and J.E. McKanna., Everyone seemed pleased that the, matter was finally started. Mr. Mc, Kanna offered suggestions for two, changes in the contract., Councilman Wolland called atten, tion to the fact that the rock from the, Alaska-Juneau tunnel was now avail, able and moved that the street com, mittee take action at once to provide, means of securing it to the end that, the city might improve the streets, permanently. After ordering the pay, ment of bills the meeting was then, adjourned., fOR THE RELIEF |, OE INDIGENTS, Today Governor Clark in discus, sing matters connected with Alaska\'s, destitute white persons referred to a, bill now pendiug in Congress for the, relief of white indigents. It is a, matter that has caused much comment, throughout all the Territory. In the, interior, at Fairbanks and at Nome,, the Order of Alaska Fioueers. has, done much to relieve the distress of, old time prosoectors. This work and, burden belongs to the federal govern i, ment. the Governor thinks, and that, the men who have worn out their, physical strength in the development, Ct the country should be cared for, from the Alaska Fund in the Treasury, of the United States. Governor Clark, said:, "This is a season of the year when, we must regret more than ever that, no provision has been made for the j, relief of destitution in Alaska. As is J, well known the cases which are ob, jects of charity are comparatively j, few in this Territory and usually are, the result of physical accidents. A j, bill was passed by the Senate in May., 1911, setting aside five per cent of, the Alaska Fund for the relief of in-,, digent white persons. When I went\', to Washington last winter I urged the, House committe on territories to take 1, some action on this bill, which had, been pending in the House for nearly, a year. The Senate bill was soon, passed by the House, but in a radi-:, callv amended form., "If the bill had taken its natural, course it would have then been sent, to a conference committee of the two, houses with the object of reconcil, ing the differences and reporting It!, back for final passage. So far as 1, can learn no conference committee, ever acted on the measure. I have, gone as far as I can appropriately in, the matter, but it is regrettable that, this bill which has become so nearly, a law has not been finally acted up, on.", ARRESTED ON HIS, OWN CONFESSION, PORTLAND. Ore.. Jan. 18.?A man, giving his name as John S. Claire, has, been arrested here on his own confes, sion that he has committed numerous, postoffice robberies throughout the, country. He also says that he mur, dered John Miller, a Vina. California,, farm hand last summer, his motive, being the robbery of his victim., A complete line of tobacco jars and, pipe racks at BURFORDS., Job Printing at The Empire Office, SAMUELSON DIED, BY HIS OWN HAND, The death in the cabin on the Basin, road reported in The Empire of yes, terday resulted from suicide, according, to the evidence disclosed at the in, quest held yesterday afternoon under, direction of Commissioner Grover C., Winn. Timothy Howard and John, Sweeney, who discovered the dead, body, were the only witnesses to tes, tify at the inquest except Dr. Eggin, ton, who made an examination of the, body. The verdict follows:, "We, the jury, duly impanelled, sworn and qualified, find the name, of the deceased is John Samuelson;, that came to his death in the Silver, bow basin. Alaska, on the sixteenth or, seventeenth day of January, 1913, in, the following manner, that is to say:, that he committed suicide by stab, giug himself two times in the abdo, men., C. W. Hatch., E. Hurlbutt., L. J. Reedy., D. Yaeger., Tom Keefe., John Sweeney.", DEFENSE MOVES, FOR A DISMISSAL, The transportation case , or more, properly , the Skagway wharf case,, took a new turn today. E. J. Shaw,, manager of the Skagway wharf, who, was on the stand for the government, yesterday afternoon, was again called, this morning. When Mr. Shaw had, finished testifying Max Kalish was re, called for a brief time. The govern, ment then rested as its case was com, plete., After a deluge of motions to strike, certain evidence Attorney Shackle, ford, for defendants, moved for a non, suit and dismissal for each of the de, fendants separately on the grounds, that the government had not pro, duced sufficient evidence to call for, a defense.., The jury was excused at 11 o\'clock, and the argument in support of the, motion was begun by Attorney Strat, ton. Mr. Stratton was still talking, as court adjourned at noon and re, sumed his argument this afternoon., There are several other attorneys, representing the defense yet t> be, heard. It is quite probable that all ol, today and part of Monday will be, consumed by the argument., The only place in Juneau where you, can buy Augustine & Kyer\'s famous, candies is at Barragar\'s Postofflct, Store. A fresh shipment just received, Every thing that will please a smok, er may be found at BURFORD\'S., GRAND CAMP, IS REPUDIATED, SEWARD, Jan. 18.?Seward Camp, of the Arctic Brotherhood, at a re, cent meeting adopted resolutions pro, testing against the action of the, Grand Camp, at the North Vauncouv, er, B.

The hearings will be extended into, I February., Phone your subscription to The, Daily Empire. Phone 3-7-4., [Senate Democrats Are, righting Confirmations, WASHINGTON. Jan. 18.?The dead, lock in the Senate between the Repub, licans and Democrats over the ques, tion of the confirmation of nomina, tions sent to the Senate by President, Taft is becoming more pronounced, with each batch of new nominations, that are sent to that body., The Democratic Senators before the, holiday recess determined to permit, no confirmations excepting of army, and navy appointments. Subsequent, ly they suggested to the Republican, Senators that joint committee be ap, pointed to reach an agreement on the, matter, but this plan the Republican, members rejected., An unfortunate phase of the ques, tion is the growing bitterness that, is being developed. The Democratic, leaders of the fight to present the, confirmation of nominations are Sen, ator Gore, of Oklahoma, and Senator, Clarke, of Arkansas., Deadlock in Illinois J, Over Election of Speaker, SPRINGFIELD, Ills., Jan. 18?The, Speakership deadlock i? still unbrok, en, and as a result Governor-elect Ed, ward F. Dunne cannot be inaugurated, until the deadlock is broken, and a, Speaker has been elected., The inauguration is now a week ov, erdue, and there seems .to be little, prospect in sight that a Speaker will, be elected., The legislature is composed of Re, publicans, Democrats, Progressives, and three Socialists, none having a, majority. There are also two United, States Senators to be elected., PUJO COMMITTEE SCARES BANKS, NEW YORK, Jan. 18.?Scared by, the Pujo committee, the First Nation, al Bank interests, with J. Pierpont, Morgan and George F. Baker in the, forefront, have relinquished their, stock control of the Chase National, Bank, which the First National has, held through the First Security Com, pany, handmaiden to the First Nation, al., The transfer marks what is believed, to be the beginning of the end of the, control of one or more banks in the, United States by another bank through 1, the subterfuge of a trust company or, holding company., With banks, trust companies and in, surance companies tossed about in, Wall street almost daily, the trans, fer of the Chase, were it not for the, existence of the Pujo committee,, would attract little attention. But, back of this transfer, nominal though, it may prove to be, is the story of, the alarm that has been spread, through the financial district by the, investigations of the Pujo committee, and the means that are being taken, to prevent that committee from prov, ing to the country at large the exist, ence of a Money Trust., ELECTION Of, FEDERAL JUDGES, ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 18.?By a, unanimous vote the lower house of, the State legislature today adopted a, joint resolueion which will be pre, sented to Congress asking that body, to provide for the election of all fed, eral judges by the people., The legislature is considering much, legislation of a progressive nature., TOWNS SWEPT, BY FLOODS, 1SVANSVILLE, Ind., Jan. 18. ? The, towns of Enterprise, Ind., and Madi, son vllle, Webster and Tompkins, on, the Kentucky side, have been swept, away by the Ohio river flood. Many, houses are floating past this city., CHICAGO TREASURY, HAS BEEN EMPTIED, CHICAGO, Jan. 18. ? The city, treasury of Chicago is empty, and, Mayor Carter Harrison announced, that he will issue an immediate ap, peal to the State legislature for the, enactment of legislation to enable the, city to issue bonds to the amount of, $2,700,000., BAR HANDSHAKING, ST. LOUIS, Jan. 18.?The Imperial, Club of St. Louis, probably the most, fashionable organization in the city,, has put a ban on handshaking, and, henceforth only the most formal to, will be proper at its functions., Persons who directed a recent ball, of the organization said that in mak, ing the change they were following, an Eastern custom which is becoming, general, and that sanitation had noth, ing to do with it. They said the rule, against handshaking was made when, it was discovered that the majority, of the guests when introduced or, when meeting old friends merely, bowed, and they consider the change, as an improvement, JACK JOHNSON, TO FIGHT PALZER, NEW York, Jan. 18.?Jack John, son, the colored heavyweight cham, pion pugilist of the world, has agreed, to fight A1 Palzer on June 25 for the, world\'s championship., According to the agreement the, fight is to take place in Paris, France,, on the inght of June 25. The pro, moter of the fight is R. Lippe, of Par, is, and the winner is to take sixty, percent and the loser to have forty, percent of a guaranteed purse of $20,, 000. Johnson and Palzer may make, as many side bets as the please., A. B.\'S SUSTAIN, THEIR RECORDER, Up in Arms Against Attempt to, Scuttle the Order., FAIRBANKS, Jan. 18.?Fairbanks, and Cleary camps Arctic Brother, hood at meeting recently passed, strong resolutions approving the de, termination of Grand Arctic Record, er Keller in withholding his signa, ture from charters of subordinate, camps south of fifty-four degrees, twenty minutes north latitude., The Brothers here and in interior, Alaska are up in arms against the, attempted assault upon the honored, geographical boundaries of the or, der of Arctic Brotherhood and they, determinedly repudiate as unconsti, tutional the recent action of the, Grand Camp., A special committe has been ap, pointed and are now in communica, tion with the Grand Camp officers, and with other subordinate camps,, to prevent action in the formation, of the proposed camps below the, established line. If the necessity, require such action, it is proposed, to take the matter into the courts, and ask for an injunction to pre, vent the Issuance of charter for such, camps., The present agitation will assuredly, result in eventually holding Grand, Camps entirely within the borders of, the order with only bona fide resi, dents as officers., FOR REN^ ? F\'ve-room house un, furnished. Inquire of Juneau Dairy.tf., Note of the Powers, Delivered to Turkey, CONSTANTINOPLE, Jan. 18.?The, note of the European powers been, delivered to the Turkish govern, ment., The note urges the cession of Adri, anople and suggests that the question, of the disposition to be made of the, Aegean islands be left to the powers:, for settlement. Notice is also served j, on Turkey that unless she complies., with the wishes of the powers she I, will no longer have their moral sup-:, port., Turkey\'s final conditions which re !, suited in the note of the powers stip, ulated that the western frontier ], [, should follow the rivers Maritza and, Tunju. Turkey was to retain Adrian, ople, bit Kirk-Killiseh, on the north, ern frontier, was to bo abandoned. It, was int. mated, however, that Tur-key, was willing to raze the Adrianople, forts and transfer to the allies the, Christian villages in the villayet of, Adrianople., LONDON, Jan. 18. ? Nazaz Pasha, Turkish ambassador to Germany, has, issued a statement bitterly arraigning, the powers for their attitude in the, note presented to the Porte., SULZER EXERCISES PARDON POWER, ALBANY, N. Y., Jan. 18.?Governor, William Snlzer has pardoned Emll, Brandt, on the ground that his sen, tence was excessive. A condition of, the pardon was Brandt\'s confession, of swearing to falsehoods in his form, er efforts to obtain release., Brandt was serving sentence of thir, ty years 011 a conviction of burglary,, and bad served three years of the, term. He was formerly employed in, the home of a son of Jacob Cchiff, tin*, New York banker, and the crime tor, which he was convicted was the steal, inn of some jewelry and trinkets. He, alleged that he pleaded guilty by reas, on of pressure brought to bear upon, him by members of the Schiff family,, and was led to believe that he would, receive only a nominal sentence., About two years ago he made sensa, tion charges against Schiff which re, sulted in a grand jury investigation., Tin Mining in 1912, in Seward Peninsula, Tin., The dredge which was installed on, Buck creek, Seward, peninsula, last, year was operated throughout the, open season of 1912. It is currently, reported that the output of 1912 is, much larger than that of 1911. The, Lost river lode tin property has been, bonded and is now being systemati, cally developed. The results of these, operations in 1912 are reported to jus, tify further investments and the in, stallation of a mill. This property, promises to become the first produc, tive lode-tin mine in Alaska., Placer Mining., The returns from the Alaska placer, mines are far from being complete,, but the information at hand indicates, that the value of the output in 1912, was half a million dollars less than, that of the previous year. This de, crease in production is due to the, fact that the output from the Fair, banks and Innoko-Iditarod regions was, considerably less in 1912 than in 1911., On the other hand, a discovery of, rich placer ground was made in the, Koyukuk district, and promising finds, were made in the Ruby district and, the Innoko-Iditarod region. More, over, the two years\' work brought ad, ditional proof of the adaptability of, the dredge for placer mining in dif, ferent parts of the Territory., No noteworthy changes took place j, in the placer-mining districts along, the I^cific seaboard, which are rela, tively unimportant. A little mining, was done at Juneau and some larger!, operations were carried on in the Por-1, cupine district. Beach mining con, tinues to employ a score of men at, Yakataga and probably as many more, in Southwestern Alaska, notably on, Kodiak island., The season in the Nizina district, was successful except for the floods, which occurred in the latter part of, the summer and caused much dam, age to the two large plants there in, stalled. The plant on Chititu creek, was, however, put into working order, again before the close of the season., Mining continued a3 in previous years, in the C\'histochina district but was, considerably less in the Valdez creek, district, chiefly because a large num, ber of claims were under bond to a, company which proposed to install a, large hydraulic plant., Hydraulic operations were contin, ued on Kenai peninsula and at Crow, crtek, as in previous years. A dredge, installed in 1911 was operated on Ke, nai river for part of the season of, 1912. There was also considerable, prospecting in this part of the field, for dredging ground., It is reported that the Yentna dis, trict had a very prosperous season., Notable ncrease in production was, made on Dollar creek, where some, high gravels were developed. A few, prospectors continue work in the Mul, chatna region, west of Lake Clark,, but no important discoveries have, been made in this field., Yukon Basin., The Fairbanks district continues to, lead in the production of placer gold., The new discoveries in this field were, principally those on creeks which, have already yielded some gold. The, most important was on Eva creek., The work of the year has also consid, erably increased the area known to be, underlain by workable gravels in the, Chatanika Flats, near the mouths of, Dome and Cleary creeks. Additional, gold-bearing gravels are said to have, been found on Fairbanks creek. The, Fairbanks, creek dredge was operated, throughout much of the open season., The gold produced at Fairbanks came, chiefly from Coldstream creek, the, lower parts of Dome and Cleary, creeks, and .Ester, Eva, and Fairbanks, creeks. It is estimated that between, 130 and MO different plants were oper, ated and that from 900 to l,5(ft) men, were employed. Summer operations, were much In excess of those of the, winter., SEE HANDWRITING, ON THE WALL, SKAGWAY, Jan. 18.?Grand Arc, tic Recorder J. M. Keller, of the Arc, tic Brotherhood, today made public, a cablegram from Grand Arctic Chief, Harry Landohl to the effect that no, charters will be issued for the organ, ization of camps outside the original, Jurisdiction of the Brotherhood, as, he now believes the delegates who at, tended the session of the Grand, Camp held at North Vancouver, B., C., last November, did not vote the, sentiment of the subordinate camps., Phone your want ads to The Dailz, Empire, phone 3-7-4, I Subscribe for The Empire., RODEN ALSO MAY, BE A CANDIDATE, FAIRBANKS, Jan. 18. ?Senator, elect Henry Roden, of Iditarod, is be, ing urged to become a candidate for, president of the territorial Senate, but, as yet, has not decided to enter the, race. He wishes to confer with his, colleague \'from this division. Senator, elect Dan Sutherland, of Ruby, who, may himself be a candidate for the, position., COLUMBIA RIVER FROZEN, PORTLAND, Ore. Jan. 18.?As a re, sult of the severe weather of the past, two weeks the upper Columbia river, is now frozen.]', '[ALASKA DAILY EMPIRE, J. F. A. STRONG, Telephone No. .\'1-7-4, Entered as second-class matter November 7. 1912 at the postotllce at Ju, neau.

JANUARY 18, 1913, BY WAY OF SUGGESTION., WE EXPECT fruits from the seed sown at Commercial Club\'s, banquet. The usefulness and the activities of the club, should be largely increased. It should receive accessions\', of membership, and with the infusion of more new blood its use, fulness should be greatly enlarged. There is plenty of work for, it to do. It might take up the question of transportation between 1, here and Seattle, with the different steamship companies and, have them arrange their sailing schedules, so as not to "bunch", several steamers at the same time in port, and then a long wait, for another. It should not be difficult to arrange it. And it might, also be suggested to the steamship companies that it would be, desirable to arrange their schedules so that vessels may arrive, and depart during the hours of daylight or in the early evening., This would be particularly desirable during the tourist season., And there are many other matters of a kindred nature that the, Commercial Club could aid materially, and everyone should, help., President-elect Woodrow \\\\ ilson says that his mind is still, open as to Cabinet suggestions. And his ear is still close to, the ground., THE LAW AND THE SUNDAY., ATTORNEY Z. R. CHENEY says that he is not in favor of, a Sunday closing law, but instead, he would have the one, now on the statute books repealed, because it is a dead let, ter, and has never been enforced. It is probably true that a law, that cannot be enforced would be better out of the code than in, it. And it is also a fact that in Alaska the Sunday closing law is, more honored in the breach than in the observance. In most of, the Alaska towns, however, the law is obeyed, not because it is, the law perhaps, but from choice; and throughout the Territory, on Sunday nearly all business houses will be found closed. As, for a general closing law, however, it would be found difficult, to enforce it, inasmuch as there are peculiar conditions found, here, which obtain nowhere else, and which are entitled to con, sideration. No law can be enforced that has not public senti, ment behind it, and when that is created, laws will be enforced,, and not before. We do not think that any man should be com, pelled to observe any fixed day as Sunday. There are several, Sundays in the week, if we consult the religious calendars of, dilferent sects, and one man\'s Sabbath day is as good as anoth, er\'s. Nevertheless mankind is fairly entitled to one day\'s rest, out of seven., Some of those Alaskan novels?and other novels too?need, a reduction works to boil the gems of thought out of waste lit, erature., MR. BALLINGER AND MR. PINCHOT., Former secretary of the interior ballinger says, that Gifford Pinchot, a gentleman, who is not generally pop, ular in the West and throughout Alaska, is working in the, interests of the cattlemen and the timber monopolies, notably, the Weyerhauser Syndicate, which controls millions of acres of, land throughout the Northwestern States. Possibly Mr. Bal, linger is right, but it is hardly likely. . Pinchot is an enthus, iast by temperament; he is a one-idea man. without the qualities, of statesmanship; he studied forestry in Germany and became, obsessed with the European idea of conservation, and then at, tempted to apply it indiscriminately all over the United States, regardless of conditions. And therein lay his mistake., This is an age of conservation, as a learned high schooi, graduate informs us, but Mr. Pinchot\'s idea of conservation, it, seems, is not so much to make use of the waste products of na, ture. as to fence them all in and make reservations of most of, our natural land resources, including timber, coal, and untilmate, ly, all other minerals. Materials that were once carelessly, thrown away are now utilized; the packers claim that most of, their profits come from materials that were formerly discard, ed; the Steel Trust makes millions annually by converting its, ash-heaps into cement; waste cloth is turned into paper and from, waste paper car wheels are made. In this scientific day scarce, ly anything should be considered worthless until it has been, through at least three reduction processes., It is not of record that Mr. Pinchot has ever directed his, energies to making waste places blossom; he has never, so far, as we know, tried to make two blades of grass grow where only, one grew before; but he has been infinitely busy in attempting, to close up effectually from human endeavor, those raw natural, resources of the nation, whose development is necessary to its, growth, welfare and progress He had an easy job in the begin, ning. for when he nodded in the days of President Roosevelt, another reservation was setaside, or more of the public miner, al lands were withdrawn, by executive order, from the people., But, while we believe that Mr. Pinchot is a mistaken zealot,, who has received much more publicity than his abilities deserve,, we do not share Mr. Ballinger\'s notion that he is an agent of the, big trusts that want the public domain reserved exclusively for, their uses. Mr. Pinchot is not the material factor that he once, was in the Government\'s conservation policy. He promises to, be even less in the future., Nothing has been heard from Mr. Murphy, of Tammany, hall, since Governor Sulzer threw his hat into the ring., THE SILENCE OF GERMANY., i, THE Europeon powers have not presented that "note" to the 1, Turkish government, which was to serve notice on the Turk \', that he must accede to the demands of the Balkan allies. (, The reason for the delay of the powers is Germany. That coun- \\, try is silent, or was silent yesterday. In Germany a year ago i, the belief was almost universal that war with Great Britain was, inevitable; it was believed it could not be delayed beyond last, Spring. The German belief was shared to a large extent in Eng, land., Germany\'s national destiny demands territorial expansion,, it was said, and Great Britain blocks the way; hence there must, be war. And now Germany\'s silence may or may not be signif, icant, for there is only one genuine motive of war between Eng, land and Germany?namely an itch to fight. Behind all, the, modern statesmanly phrases about national destiny stands the, mediaeval spirit that delights in killing?the identical spirit that, devastated Holland, depopulated the Palatinate, and wrought other, ghastly horrors., But we think there will be no general European war, which, would likely be precipitated by a clash between the Teuton and, the Anglo-Saxon, because the people who must do the fighting, are now strongly represented in both governments. The Social, ists in the German Reichstag and their equivalent in the Brit, ish Parliament are the best guarantors of peace., Perhaps the Money Trust investigating committee could, get more out of William Rockefeller by striking up a correspond, ence with him., Judging by the results so far achieved, there can be no ef, fectual dissolution of the trusts except by practical confiscation., I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 111 I I I 81111 11111111, Add to the Comfort and Charm of Your Home ?!:, Nothing adds more to the attractiveness of the home than , ,, n well-appointed table.

O\'CONNOR, Latest Novelties in, Tobacco Jars and, Pipe Racks, at Burford\'s, America Ahead of Europe, in Handling of Mail, PARIS. Jun. 18. ? From investiga, tion into the operation of the English, and Continental railway mail service, it may be doubted if Americans have, yet realized the advantages of a par, cels post or form any adequate idea, of the demands that will be made on, your mail service. If Americans take, hold of the idea as the Europeans, have done it will be necessary for the, Postoffice Department to not only ex, tend its present facilities and intro, duce new one wherever possible, but, to replace hand labor with automatic, machinery wherever conditions per, mit., The French authorities are deeply, interested in an American automatic, system for the exchange of mail be, tween trains running at high speed, and the stations. Moving pictures of, a demonstration of this system be-;, fore the American postal officials have, been exhibited in Belgium. Germany,, Austria Italy and Spain, and France,, and will be shown in England and, South America., M. Ma* on, chief of the Bureau de, Corresp .idance Internationale says, that th} French authorities have 1, clung ti the old system of exchanging i, mail by hand, with the train proceed- i, ing scarcely faster than a walk, be- 1, cause tests were made with devices i, heretofore presented have been very i, unsatisfactory on account of failure, to work and destruction of mail. ], This sounds very much like the catch- i, er-arm system of the United States, <, which has been in operatiou forty 1, years. Another feature of the French I, postal system that would operate ?, against an automatic system of mail, exchange is that a receipt is given, every time an exchange is made., In 1898 there were no exclusive, mail trains in France; now there are, three Buch trains?Paris to Lyons,, Paris to Lille and Paris to Erquelines., Comparatively little newspaper mail, is carried on these trains. The most, important Is the Paris to Lyons train, which makes but three stops, though, it passes through about sixty towns., All international trains de luxe carry, mail but give the minor towns tho go, by., The samo system is in UBe in Eng, land that has been in effect since 1848,, with little improvement or alteration., This Is known as the Dicker appara, tus, a combination of ropes, chains,, posts and bars. There are in Great, Itritaln seventy-thre traveling postof, fices, composed of 226 especially con, structed carriages, 159 of which are, fitted with mall catching and deliver, ing apparatus. The number of sta, tions equipped with this device is, 245., There are two exclusive mail trains, of ten cars each. These are the "up", and "down" specials. They run be, tween London and Aberdeen, about, 100 miles. No passengers are carried, and there is only one apparatus car, riage to each train., No attempt is made to deliver news, papers or parcels on these apparatus, cars; only first class mail is han, lied; newspapers and parcels wait, tor the local trains. No more than, tour pouches are exchanged, and se\', 1om this number., Bulgar and Turk Owe, Much to Americans, CONSTANTINOPE, Jan. 18?Ameri, cana and English together helped, Turkish soldiers out of the deathtrap, which the indolence and utter stupidity \', of their officials prepared for them, Chief among the little band of men, who began quietly and unobtrusively |, to work in that appalling shambles, which was the cholera camp of San, Stefano was Major Ford., Like most men who do big things,, lie has a little voice and an unobtru, sive manner. One finds him in a cop, ner of the club smoking room with a, tialf dozen junior American attaches, and students trying (and failing) to, Set him to tell the story of those first j, three ghastly days in the Greek school I, it San Stefano?days when the uttel I, stupidity of the Turkish officers crowd j, ed sick and wounded together into an, inferno from which, had there been, no foreign help, not a man could have, escaped alive. Men lay in heaps about, the room, and if they had no strength, to crawl to the door where a frighten-i, ed orderly set a basket of bread some-1, times and a pitcher of water less, often still, they just died of hunger, tind thirst., Khmet and Stupidity., When a newspaper correspondent, asked Major Ford if the Turks simply, relied as usual on Allah and declared, that if fate willed so the men would, die and If fate willed otherwise they, would live, so there was no use in, worrying, he answered that he sup, posed fatalism, as usual, played sonte, part, but he believed that the worst, fault was pure stupidity?sheer ina, bility to organize even relief work., The correspondent remarked that it, ; is reported that when a detachment, 1 gets cholera the Turks simply shut, J sick and wounded up together, know, ing the whole lot would bo useless for, further fighting, and so give them all, a chance to die and save transport., The Major smiled grimly and said:, "That would mean isolating whole de, tachments. and if the Turks ever did, as much as that there would be some, hope. They have not got as far as, I that.", I To an inquiry how the American ar, t rangements were progressing the Ma, jor replied that a part of his work, had now been taken over by the Brit, ish Red Crescent organization at Scu, tari, Col. Surtees having sent a de, tachment to San Stefano to open a, hospital. He suggested that there was, I some difficulty at first in getting the, Red Cross units to interest themselves, actively in the relief of the cholera, patients. Of his own work and ex, ; periences in the first days the Ma, jor appeared unwilling to talk; in, fact he did not appear to think that, there was anything unusual in the ef, forts he made to step in where hith, ! erto every regular organization had, ; been wanting., CHURCH NOTES., Presbyterian Church, John B.

WILSON, FOR U. S. SENATOR, Brother of President-elect Senator, Wilson a Newspaper Man., NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 18.? The, deadlock In the legislature over the, election of a United StateB Senator, has brought out much discussion, among politicians and members of the, legislature of the possibility of unit, ing upon Joseph R. Wilson, brother, of President-elect Woodrow Wilson, as, a compromise. The President-elect\'s, brother is not a candidate, and the, suggestion that all factions might, unite on him was made entirely with, out his knowledge or authorization., Joe Wilson, as his friends all call, him, is city editor of the Nashville, Banner. He Is one of the political, reporters in the South, and during, his reportorial days and since he has, enjoyed the confidence and respect, of Tennessee\'s political leaders., At a recent banquet given in his, honor by the Nashville Board of, Trade and the Nashville Press Club, a fellow newspaper man from New, York first publicly suggested the pro, priety of Mr. Wilson\'s involuntary, candidacy as the best solution of a, possible deadlock. The speaker told, of the trying position in which "Little, Brother" had been placed in New, York, where he was forced by circum, stances to measure up with the big, gest men of the Democratic party,, and how he had astonished his hear, ers at the public dinner where he was, called upon to exhibit his oratorical, ability in competition with Woodrow, Wilson\'s. The younger Wilson, al, though lacking experience as a cam, paigner, is a ready and convincing, speaker., The principal difficulty Mr. Wilson\'s, friends are meeting is the fact that, the members of the Legislature were, commltteed to one or another of the, numerous avowed candidates before, his name was mentioned. But if a, deadlock offers an opportunity to end, the bitter factional strife by uniting, on Wilson, Tennessee may add an, other to the roster of editors it has, sent to Washington., ALASKA S. S.
