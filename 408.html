        <pre>['C H A P T E R  X \nIssues of Access to Knowledge: \nDropping Out of School \nM U R R Y  R. N E L S O N  \n"There can be no \'Dropout Curriculum\'--even a curriculum for \n\'Potential Dropouts\' often affronts both principles and sensitivity and \nis considered \'second class.\' ,,l So wrote William H. Bristow in 1964, \nwho added that "no self-respecting dropout wants to be so identified, \nor so  labeled or handled. \'\'2 For Bristow, the best hope for dealing with \nthe dropout problem was a good curriculum--for all children. That is \nsubstantially the thesis on which this chapter is based: by following \napproved educational practices rather than encouraging students who \ndo not do well to leave school we can reduce dropouts. Heterogene- \nous grouping, clarity of instruction, a life-related curriculum, and help \nfor children who cannot keep up with the class are some characteristics \nof programs where children remain in school. \nThe idea that the school\'s holding power is related to what is \ntaught and how it is taught is hardly new. Before World War |, \nproponents of the junior high schoo!argued that if programs provided \nthe opportunity for election of courses in accord with students\' \ninterests and aptitudes, students would be held through the period \nwhen most dropping out took place--the period from ages twelve \nthrough fifteen. General exploratory courses in the junior high school \nwere intended to reveal to the students the possibilities of a general \nfield of knowledge (such as science) and to whet the appetite for more. \nThese courses were to be life related. According to Thomas H. \nBriggs, the junior high school was the outcome of criticism from the \npublic, "as it has been unable to keep in the high schools its children, \nwho have neither succeeded nor been satisfied with the traditional \nofferings. \'\'3 \nBriggs knew well that administrative reorganization does not \nbring about changes in methods of instruction. "Reorganization offers \nan opportunity rather than assures an ideal. \'\'4 The results would \ndepend on whether the ideal was clear on the part of teachers and \n226 \n', 'NELSON 227 \nadministrators, on whether they believed in it, and on the education \nand supervision of teachers. This is no less true today. \nOur forebears were concerned with increasing the "holding \npower" of the school so that students who left after the eighth grade \nwould stay until the ninth or tenth grade. Today because of the \ngeneral view that the public school should educate everyone through \nhigh school, we are concerned about the "dropout problem." The \ndifference is more than semantic; there has been a subtle shift fromthe \nschool to the child as the problem. Briggs\'s generation attempted to \nimprove the school\'s holding power by developing a diversified \ncurriculum that met a wide range of interests and levels of talent, that \noffered an effective program of vocational education and academic \nstudies, keeping the lines between the areas of study fluid. Today, \ndropping out is all too frequently viewed as a problem in the \nfunctioning of the individual; he or she must improve, not the \ncurriculum. In the words of the New York State task force on \nminority dropouts: \nThe programs seem to be based on blaming the victim while letting teachers \nand administrators go on with whatever they\'ve been doing. There is no focus \non changing teachers\' or administrators\' attitudes or teaching styles. There is \nno suggestion of curriculum revision or creation of new instructional materials, s \nEvery so often we view the dropout as a problem; the last time was \nin the Johnson administration with its short-lived War on Poverty. In \nmy view, if teachers continually encouraged young people to remain \nin school and the encouragement was supported by the way learning \nexperiences were handled, then dropout projects would be \nunnecessary. In our lifetime we have all seen numerous projects and \nprograms of various kinds inaugurated, only to see them give way to \nthe next real or imagined educational crisis. In the 1960s, the School \nDropout Project of the National Education Association suffered this \nfate. \nCurriculum workers and teachers should always seek materials and \nmethods that make the school day more attractive as well as more \ngenuinely educational. Curriculum improvement should be ongoing, \nnot a response to one of the innumerable crises that give rise to \neducational reform movements. The alternative is that someone\'s \nneeds will be put on the back burner, and all too often it is those of the \nchild with the habit of failure and frustration--the potential dropout. \nHow should the curriculum be modified to decrease the likelihood of \n', '228 D R O P P I N G  O U T  O F  S C H O O L  \ndropping out? What are the cautions and cues for curriculum workers? \nThis chapter addresses these problems. \nWhat Is a Dropout? \nAt first glance the answer to this question is obvious: a dropout is \nanyone who leaves school before graduating. Quay and Allen note \nthat it is not a simple matter to determine the extent of dropping out \nand, since the definition is not universal, "practices differ\'from district \nto district o r  even from school to school within a district, and by the \naccuracy with which data are collected and transmitted to central \nauthorities. \'\'6 Thus, much latitude is left to the local reporters, who \nare often school principals. Depending on their views, leaving school \nto marry because of pregnancy, to join the armed forces, or to transfer \nto evening school may or may not be called dropping out. "Stopping \nout" may be identified as dropping out, although some data identify \n"stopouts" as 10 percent of the dropout total, most of whom go on to \npostsecondary educationJ \nKaeser identifies two common methods for counting dropouts. \nOne method--an incidence count--is to count the number of students \nwho leave school in a certain year. A second method, the cohort \nsurvival method, gives the proportion of students who entered the \ngroup but did not make it to graduation with their peers. 8 \nIn many places students who are too young to leave school legally \nare counted as truants when they have dropped out. The writer can \neasily identify with such "manipulation," having taught in schools \nwhere students who accumulated over fifty consecutive days of \nabsence were still kept on the rolls. \nIn illinois a study by Arnold suggested that 25 percent of Hispanic \nand black sophomores eventually dropped 0ut. 9 Over half were \nfemale, one-third of whom had one or more children. Arnold\'s data \non 1,950 Illinois sophomores along with national data are shown in \ntable 1. \nThe 1982 U.S. Census dropout data that McDill, Natriello, and \nPallas used estimated that Hispanic males have a dropout rate of 44 \npercent, Hispanic females 29 percent, with both rates rising annually. \nFor blacks, the rate was 18.9 percent for males, 19.7 percent for \nfemales and getting lower. For whites, the rate was 18 percent for \nmales and 13 percent for females, with little change over previous \nyears. 10 \n', 'N E L S O N  \nTABLE 1 \nDROPOUT RATE IN 1984, Jr~ PERCENT \n229 \nh.Hxols U S \nFemales 10.7 12.6 \nMales 14.2 14.7 \nWhites 10.2 12.2 \nBLacks 24.8 17.0 \nHispanics 25.9 18.0 \nNative Americans 15.2 29.2 \nAll 13.2 13.6 \nSOURCE: A Profile of Illinois Dropouts (Springfield, IL: Illinois State Board of Educa- \ntion, Department of Planning, Research, and Evaluation, 1985). ERIC ED 262 314. \nDropout rates in Ohio, North Carolina, and California are \ncomparable to those found in IUinois. The high school graduation \nrates for states are highest in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, \nWisconsin, and South D~ikota, where the rates range from 88.2 to 82.7 \npercent. The lowest graduation rates are in the District of Columbia, \nfollowed by California, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and South \nCarolina, with rates ranging from 56.9 to 62.6.11 \nWho Drops Out and Why? \nA picture that has already begun to emerge is reinforced over and \nover. A typical dropout is poor, usually a person of color, below \naverage in achievement, often behind chronological peers in grade \nlevel, has less educated parents, is easily discouraged, has poor \nattendance records, and is seen by teachers as uncooperative. \nIn 1974 the Children\'s Defense Fund (CDF) issued a report \nentitled Children Out of School in America. In a nine-state study of over \n6,500 families in 505 districts, many conclusions regarding dropouts \nand potential dropouts were drawn. CDF determined that most of the \nchildren not in school were poor. Many of them were "allowed" out, \n"counseled" out, "pushed" out, or "encouraged" to drop out. CDF \nconcluded that whatever the term the result is the same--exclusion \nfrom school. Denial of access to the curriculum makes it more likely \nthat "children will grow up to be illiterate, unemployed, delinquent, \nrebellious, and dependent. \'\'j2 CDF regarded dropping out as \ntantamount to exclusion from school. \nWhen CDF asked children out of school (or their parents) the \nreasons for their leaving school, the most frequently reported response \n', '2 3 0  D R O P P I N G  O U T  O F  S C H O O L  \nwas that the children "did not like school." The response was believed \nto mask the real reasons: "We found that children may not like school \nif they cannot read well and are not given appropriate instruction or \nmaterials in school. They may not like school if they are of average \nintelligence but are incorrectly labeled and placed in a special class for \nslow learners. \'\'13 McDili, Natriello, and Pallas also found that many \nstudents dropped out because of poor grades or because they felt that \nschool was "not for them. \'\'14 \nUnemployed dropouts interviewed by Miller claimed that they \ndid not leave school volunt~arily but were pushed out and often in \nquite a direct way. Although "unemployable," these dropouts had \npositive attitudes toward school, thought the teachers were fair, and \nmissed school for social reasons--such as meeting friends during the \nday. 15 Miller\'s observations match those made by the Children\'s \nDefense Fund and by others made even more recently. He noted that \nmany of the dropouts saw school as negative and boring. They had to \nget away and the school, in turn, wanted them away. \nMany studies have developed the idea of mutual rejection, but, for \nthe most part, this theme has not been addressed directly. In North \nCarolina, a study of that state\'s dropouts observed that dropouts, \nbesides being poor, generally enter school with no direction, have tow \nlevels of achievement, and do poorly early in their careers. In \ninterviewing dropouts, the researchers ascertained that these entering \ncharacteristics manifested themselves in (a) a general dislike for school, \n(b) poor academic performance, and (c) discipline problems. Almost \nhalf citedEnglish as the subject that had given them the most \ntrouble, t6 A study of schools in Columbus (Ohio) by the Ohio State \nDepartment of Education reinforces most of the general characteristics \nof dropouts observed earlier. These include a feeling of rejection, a \nhigh rate of truancy or absenteeism, discipline problems in school, a \nlack of definite educational goals, low academic achievement, \nenrollment in general courses rather than college preparatory or \nvocational education courses, more difficulty in mathematics and \nreading, and more failuresY 7 \nMarsha Hirano-Nakanishi found that 40 percent of all Hispanic \ndropouts left school before grade ten, mostly at junior high school. \nHispanic youth, she asserted, were delayed from normal educational \nprogress during most of their elementary years in much greater \nnumbers than non-Hispanics, so they tended to drop out at an earlier \ngrade level. Many of the studies on dropouts do not give attention to \n', 'NELSON 231 \npre-high-school years, so many Hispanic dropouts may go unnoticed \nor may be seen as truants. ~8 \nA number of studies have gone right to the source, the dropouts \nthemselves, asking them why they dropped out. Jordan-Davis \ninterviewed ninety-five dropouts in their homes and noted that \nschool-related issues were most commonly mentioned, with \ninadequate academic preparation, especially in reading and writing, \nmentioned as the primary reason for such inadequacy. 19 \nWagner also drew on interviews and observations to find out \n"why poor kids quit attending school." Not only can they not \ncompete with their peers financially (for example, for clothing, \ncurricular and extracurricular materials), but the curriculum is not \ngeared toward the needs and interests of children. For example, the \n"real" writing of letters, memos, or committee minutes was not \ntaught. 2° \nThe Children\'s Defense Fund identified a number of barriers to \nattendance that included poverty, language, and pregnancy. In trying \nto prevent dropouts, educators now must deal with even younger girls \nwho are becoming pregnant even more frequently. In New York \nCity, for example, the rate of pregnancy among fifteen to nineteen \nyear olds has remained steady over the past five years, while the rate \namong younger girls continues to rise. No longer does New York \nCity "force" students to leave their school, although the system has \nfor sixteen years had a School for Pregnant Teens which is now at five \nsites in the city. "The head of the Board of Education\'s dropout \nprevention program, Victor Herbert, said he believed that many of \nthe girls lead such uninspiring lives that becoming pregnant was a way \nof adding some interest. \'\'21 \nOther pushouts-dropouts include expelled or suspended students, \nchildren who cannot afford textbook fees, migrant children, and \nothers who are not expected to achieve and are not taught well. \nIn a unique attempt to combat potential crime, the Dade County \nGrand Jury investigated the dropout problem in inner-city Miami. \nThrough a questionnaire administered to 264 dropouts and potential \ndropouts (144 dropouts, 120 still in school), the grand jury found that \nalienation was the strongest predictor of dropping out of school. The \ntop four reasons for dropping out were: didn\'t like school, 3 7 percent; \nwanted to work, 14 percent; expelled or suspended, 13 percent; drugs, \nrebellious, arrested, 9 percent. 22 Despite ostensible desires to work, 60 \npercent of the dropouts were unemployed and not enrolled in any \n', '232 D R O P P I N G  O U T  O F  S C H O O L  \nvocational or academic program. Most of those employed were \nearning the minimum wage. \nThe grand jury went on to create a not surprising pattern: Failure \nin school leads to a failure to finish school. This is more likely in poor \nneighborhoods where elementary teacher expectations are less for \nHispanics, much less for blacks, and where teachers see these groups \nas more likely to become delinquents. In Dade County, most \ndelinquents had dropped out and had lower reading scores3 3 \nThe grand jury thus identified a key argument for trying to \nprevent potential dropouts from leaving school: they are likely to cost \nthe county more in terms of costs of crimes committed, incarceration, \ntrials, rehabilitation, and training than the costs of providing better \ntraining before students drop out. \nKaeser speaks of what are termed "unquantifiabie costs"--higher \nincidence of alienation, negative psychological effects, less political \ninvolvement, fewer opportunities for upward ability, z4 She sees the \ndropout issue as one of equity. McDili et al. see it as one of both \nequity and excellence, 25 the latter issue flowing from the impetus of \nthe recent reports on the reform of education. To provide equity and \nexcellence, the school curriculum, both what is taught and how, must \nmore legitimately meet the needs of the "at risk" population of \npotenti~al dropouts. \nReducing the Dropout Rate \nWhat changes can help to reduce the dropout rate? The first step \nis a better recognition of the problem that is being faced. DOnald \nSmith has noted\'that the National Commission on Excellence in \nEducation was not at all concerned with dropouts in its report, A \nNation at Risk. In New York State the Regents plan did not even \nmention the word "dropouts." McDill et al. observed that many \neducational critics cite this as a major problem of omission. 26 The \nproblem of dropping out must be faced squarely, not just nationally \nbut locally as well. C. Fred Bateman, Superintendent of the \nChesapeake (Virginia) Public Schools, stresses that the issue of \ndropouts must be kept before the public and suggests a recognition \nprogram for staff involved with dropout prevention in order that the \npublic and school employees know of the commitment to "holding \npower"-and excellence. 27 Bateman suggests that this commitment to \nholding power be part of stated school policy and that it be regarded \nas part of the principal\'s job to see that the policy is implemented. \n', 'N E L S O N  2 3 3  \nAlmost all researchers and practitioners who work with dropouts \nagree that early identification is vital to dropout prevention. It is \ngenerally agreed that the seeds of dropout prevention must be sown \nearly and that potential dropouts can be identified in"elementary \nschool, even in the primary grades. \nWhat are teachers to look for? Background items include a low \neducational level of the parents, a sibling or parent who dropped out \nof school, the absence of the father from the home, and an excessively \nstressful home life. In school, students often exhibit a lack of basic \nskills, at least one grade failure, disruptive behavior, and a low level of \nself-esteem. "The best way to avoid dropping out in high school," \nwrites Mann, "is to make the elementary school more successful. \'\'28 \nTEACHER UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT \nMany dropouts say that they get no real help from teachers. \nIndeed, the teacher and the rest of the school staff may seem as eager \n(if not more so) for students to drop out as to remain in school. \nEncouraging students to drop out violates their rights to attend school \nand is in opposition to the welfare of the state, which, as Reutter \npoints out, "is served by the creation of an enlightened citizenry." \nIndeed, as he notes, "statutes requiring compulsory education of \nchildren within certain ages have long formed the backbone of the \nAmerican educational system. \'\'29 As professionals, teachers must view \nthe dropout problem as a problem, then work to correct it in a variety \nof flexible ways. Kaeser points out that schools that are effective with \nmarginal students make it their policy to be effective. 3° \nMost researchers believe that most of the students in question have \nthe mental ability to succeed. Bloom\'s work on learning, for example, \nsupports that notion unequivocally. "Most  individuals," he \nconcludes, "could learn what the schools had to teach if they were \nprovided with the time and help they needed. \'\'31 \nHow can teachers make successful programs? Nauman\'s research \nfound that common characteristics of successful dropout prevention \nprograms included the following: teacher power to control the \ncurriculum and commensurate teaching methods, the treatment of \nstudents as individuals, the relative independence of teachers from \nadministrative restraints, and a view of the curriculum as a way to \nenhance student self-worth rather than accentuating content \nexclusively. 32 \nThere is often considerable difference between learning \nexperiences as conceived in the minds of the teacher and the \n', "234 D R O P P I N G  O U T  O F  S C H O O L  \ncurriculum worker and how the student perceives them in the \nclassroom. It is difficult for teachers to know what the youngster is \nthinking and recent research suggests that the teacher should ask him \nor her. This practice not only can clear up problems in understanding \nthe work but conveys the teacher's concern. Not all children who \nhave difficulty understanding are potential dropouts, but all have the \nright to access the knowledge, which often boils down to the \nseemingly mundane (for the uninitiated) problem of the clarity of \nteachers' explanations. \nEducational research done on related problems offers guidance to \ncurriculum workers, even though the research may not deal directly \nwith the dropout problem. The research conducted by Bloom on \nalterable variables, such as teacher interaction with students, is helpful, \nas is Brookover's work on school climate. 33 Research on children's \nthinking, such as the work done by Peterson and Swing, offers \nteachers some useful ideas for preventing dysfunctional thinking \n(worry). 34 \nThere is no need to reinvent the educational wheel where the \ndropout problem is concerned. As with other educational problems, \nwe must use and build on what we already know. Work by the \nNational Education Association's Project on School Dropouts in the \n1960s suggests many ideas for the curriculum worker, as does other \nwork done in this period on achievement motivation. \nSUCCESSFUL CURRICULUM PRACTICES \nIf a school faculty believes that most children have the ability to \nsucceed, what must be done for that success to be achieved? The \nfaculty must then make a second commitment: to provide equal access \nto the curriculum through instruction that is sensitive to individual \nneeds. Access is opened when students are heterogeneously grouped \nfor instruction, as was suggested by John Goodlad in his large-scale \nstudy of schooling. Since the Goodlad study, a number of schools \nhave adopted this practice in some or all curriculum areas. An \ninteresting example is the California Demonstration Program in \nReading and Humanities at Willard Junior High School in Berkeley, \nCalifornia. \nStudents are grouped heterogeneously (from the 2nd to the 99th \npercentile) in each core English and History class and there is no \nretracking inside the classroom. At Willard, heterogeneity is not \nrandom; it is planned and organized from April until the following fall \nwhen school resumes. All students participate in group discussion. \n", "NELSON 235 \nAdolescent novels are used to teach vocabulary, critical thinking, and \nindependent reading. There is tutoring in or near each classroom. \nInstruction on a novel begins a week earlier for those students who \nneed extra time. Students role-play adolescent and adult problems. \nOther instructional techniques include cross-curricular writing (the \ncore curriculum organization lends itself to this) and cooperative \nlearning. \nWillard is a feeder school for Berkeley High School and the \nholding power of the Willard cohort at Berkeley High School has \nincreased by more than 50 percent since the program was inaugurated \nfive years ago. More than 90 percent of pupils who entered grade ten \nin 1983 graduated three years later. There is more than meets the eye \nhere; these pupils moved to a tracked situation in Berkeley High \nSchool and have succeeded when placed in the higher tracks. Not only \nhave Willard students experienced academic achievement (as measured \nby district and state testing), but there has been increased cooperation \namong students, greater respect for differences, and a marked decline \nin negative behavior. 3s \nCurriculum materials are of critical importance in whether students \nstay in school. In recent years, the use of workbooks and xeroxed \npages from workbooks has increased enormously. In the 1960s \nresearchers on the dropout problem frequently pointed to a \nconnection between dropping out of school and the overuse of \nworkbooks and other boring materials. Writers warned that \nworkbooks were a teacher's crutch and not a substitute for teaching \nthat was sensitive to individual needs. This is still true today. No \nmechanical form of instruction can substitute for classroom \ninteractions. It is even more deadly today for potential dropouts, for \nthey frequently are treated as a separate species who must be fed on a \ndiet of dull, often stupid, rote materials. As Wilbur Brookover has \ncautioned, equality of opportunity is not facilitated by differentiated \nmaterials and methods based on the presumed differences between \nchildren. A common curriculum with common materials is associated \nwith an open society. 36 The heavy use of Skinnerian technology with \npoorer students and Deweyan approaches with more able students \nwill only create more dropouts, just as it has been doing. It is also a \nviolation of educators' commitment to equal access to the curriculum. \nMoreover, as Daniel Tanner pointed out in his chapter in this \nyearbook, research does not support the idea that students who have \nnever really become interested in learning do best with a system of \nlearning that relies on workbooks, preprogrammed instruction, drills, \n", '236 D R O P P I N G  O U T  O F  S C H O O L  \nand tests (instruction delivered one piece at a time). Indeed, such \nstudents prefer discovery approaches. Rote instructional procedures \nwill not keep secondary school students in school. \nA number of curriculum practices seem to be effective in the design \nof a curriculum to prevent dropping out. In North Carolina, for \nexample, these include an extended school day, which permits more \nindividual teacher-pupil interaction; help for students with learning \nproblems so that they accumulate positive experience and develop a \npositive attitude toward school; work-study programs; special \nvocational programs; job placement centers; school-within-a-school \n(for example, teen pregnancy programs, alternative learning centers, \nspecial tutoring); alternative programs or optional schools located on \nor off campus. 37 \nA L T E R N A T I V E  PROGRAMS \nThe alternative program (AP) provides more individualized \ninstruction, reduced student-teacher ratios, more guidance, coopera- \ntive on-the-job training, as well as social and vocational counseling. \nThere is disagreement about the usefulness of AP\'s in dropout \nprevention. Some critics have noted that in some places alternative \nschools are used as "dumping grounds" for unruly students, a \ntransitional step before suspension or before the student sees no \nalternative but to drop out. \nAlternative schools recall Briggs\'s observation that organizational \nchange does not automatically leadto curriculum improvement. Thus, \nalternative schools are usually smaller than the mainstream high school \nand provide Opportunities for personal contact, support, and varied \ninstruCtion to meet individual needs. They have the potential to make \na significant impact on the dropout problem. But there are trade-offs \ninvolved that may not be readily apparent and about which \ncurriculum workers should be forewarned. For example, only in large \nschools can diversified curricula be offered. Ceilings in alternative \nschools are low where expectations are concerned (both teachers\' \nexpectations of students and students\' expectations of themselves) \nbecause of the homogeneous low-track nature of the student body. \nMoreover, alternative schools seem to be subject to the same \nconstraints as other schools where testing is concerned; the mandated \ntests still drive the curriculum. In the case of alternative schools, the \nresult may be even more dismaying; an already narrow curriculum \nbecomes a set of machinery aimed at meeting requirements for a \n', 'NELSON 237 \nGraduate Equivalency Diploma. That is what has happened in some \ncontinuation (alternative) high schools in California. \nSince 1919, nearly every school district in California is required \nby law to provide an adjustment-type continuation program for \npupils with severe attendance or behavior problems so that they can \ncomplete the requirements for high school graduation. Continuation \nschools tend to be small and originally they could function with a \nminimum of regulations. Teachers could be constructors of the \ncurriculum, the instructional program was often multigraded, and \nstudents were permitted to work at their own rate. As a result, \nstudents who were never successful in school often became motivated \nto do a great deal of work for the first time. \nWhereas the original purpose of the continuation school was to \nprovide opportunities for high school graduation, it is now generally \nviewed by administrators as supplying students with an individual- \nized program to improve their fundamental skills. The purpose is to \nprepare students to pass tests of proficiency in reading, writing, and \nmathematics in order to qualify for a Graduate Equivalency Diploma. \nTeachers are under pressure to teach to the test as scores on the \nCalifornia Assessment Program are made public. There is an absence \nof advanced course offerings, so when students pass the minimum or \nproficiency test, they quit mathematics. Nor would they be inspired \nto go on, for they become bored with fundamental skills that are \nrepeated and mechanical. As one student said when questioned, "It\'s \nthe same old stuff, over and over." \nAt continuation schools, world geography and U.S. history tend \nto be taught by packet reading; students are assigned individual \npackets of work--workbooks that are xeroxed and categorized into \npackets. The students complete the packet, get it corrected by the \nteacher, then study for a follow-up test.. Discussion and interaction is \nat a minimum. Teachers at continuation schools--as in any school-- \ncould work together as a.team. World geography could be combined \nwith U.S. history when studying the origin of road systems and \ntransportation. Geography would center on map-reading concepts. \nWhatever the state mandates, the curriculum still depends on the \nteacher. But if teachers are to exploit the opportunities offered by their \ncommitment (which they still have) to the individualized program of \nstudy to support student success, they need leadership for curriculum \nimprovement. \nAccording to Foley and Crull, the characteristics of alternative \nprograms that seem to increase the school\'s holding power include \n', '238 D R O P P I N G  O U T  O F  S C H O O L  \ndiversified teachers\' roles including that of curriculum developer; a \ncurriculum grounded in the reality of the students\' lives, intellectual \nneeds, and school system requirements; strong academic leaders; \nstudent participation in admissions, course evaluation, and classes; \nfew, but agreed upon, rules of conduct. 38 \nEven without an alternative program, Foley and Crull see some \nideas that could fit into the existing system, including redesigning the \ntraditional high school to fit the alternative model, putting first- \nsemester high school students in especially motivating classes with \nexpert teachers, and getting all students involved in some school \nactivity. This, of course, seems to fly in the face of recent education \ncommission reports, but "completion of the kinds of core curriculum \nrecommended by recent commission reports appears to do little to \nimprove the performance of students with low GPA\'s, the very \nstudents most likely to be potential dropouts. \'\'39 \nV O C A T I O N A L  PROGRAMS \nMany successful dropout prevention programs are geared toward \nthe world of work. The typical school curriculum is often seen by \npotential dropouts as meaningless, removed from life experiences, and \naffording no linkage with the future. "Since work is seen as the \nhallmark of adulthood and since the best preparation for work is work \nitself, the school must offer work experiences for such youths. \'\'4° \nMany of the students who drop out are in general curriculums \npreparing them for nothing. Those who drop out have difficulty \nfinding a job, particularly one that pays more than a minimum wage. \nVocational education may not only hold them in school, but if they \nleave, they may have had some training in job skills. Weber and \nSiivani-Lacey drew this not very surprising conclusion: "Where some. \nspecialized vocational training was provided to dropouts, the data \nsuggest that dropouts who receive vocational training generally \nexperience higher employment rates and higher average annual \nearnings than dropouts who do not receive such training. \'\'41 \nStudies of large urban school systems found that the holding \npower of school systems without separate vocational high schools \nexceeded that of systems with such schools. Moreover, the holding \npower of all high schools exceeded the rates Of separate vocational \nschools. \'\'42 While it is possible for school systems to reduce dropping \nout by making changes in teaching practices, there are limits to the \nreductions in tracked situations, which is essentially what we have \nwith separate vocational schools. 43 \n', 'NELSON 239 \nAccording to Weber and Silvani-Lacey, vocational education \nprograms aimed at minimizing dropping out should include a paid \nwork experience that relates job to school and vice versa; alternative \nprogramming with flexible scheduling; linkage with government- \nsponsored programs (like the former CETA programs, now the Job \nTraining Partnership Act); strong support services such as guidance; \nstaff cooperation and collaboration (particularly bctween content area \nand vocational teachers); studcnt involvement in extracurricular \nschool activities. 4~ \nDropouts participate infrequently in the extracurricular life of the \nschool. Recent studies have shown that student involvement in \nextracurricular activities increases student feeling of "ownership" of \nthe school which, in turn, increases the likelihood of staying in school. \nThis does not just mean band or athletics; it can be student curricular \ncommittees, student government, school newspapers, or clubs. In \norder to avoid further temporal constraints on students, these activities \nshould not all be done after school. School hours and scheduling must \nbecome more flexible. \nFoley and Crull suggest that the traditional high school, and the \njunior high and middle school as well, should be redesigned to fit the \nalternative school model of flexibility and smallness. Greater resources \nshould be allocated to high schools to promote flexibility, which may \nnot be cost-effective in the short run, but will be in the years ahead. 4s \nBut making additional resources available is not enough: changes are \ncalled for in the curriculum including teacher expectations, \ninteractions with students, and what is taught. \nLocal businesses and the citizenry must understand about, and be \ninvolved in, the effort to prevent dropouts. In Ohio, an effort has been \ndeveloped and implemented consisting of problem identification, the \nidentification of community resources, selection of appropriate \napproaches incorporating resources, incorporation of various \napproaches into the staff development process, and the establishment \nof an information clearinghouse. Included in the program is an \nevaluation of the dropout approaches. 46 \nByerly, too, found the use of community resources useful in \nretaining students, while Kaeser regards a school that works to \ninvolve the community and gain its support as a key element in \ndropout prevention. ~7 \n', '240 D R O P P I N G  O U T  O F  S C H O O L  \nCommon Elements of Effective Programs \nEffective dropout programs in Wisconsin have in common (a) \nsmall size and autonomy, (b) teacher caring and responsibility as well \nas high expectations, (c) collegial teacher culture and supportive peer \nculture of students, and (d) an individualized curriculum that \nemphasizes real-life problem solving. 48 \nSuccessful programs in Ohio include counseling, increasing the \nparticipation of students in school activities, parent involvement, and \nspecial vocational programs. 49 Success factors in programs considered \neffective by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction \nwere the deep commitment of teachers and administrators, early \nidentification of students, and highly flexible schedules in a day \nextended to 8:00 P.M. Successful programs reduced the dropout rate \nby as much-as 25 percent, s° \nOther successful programs have grown out of the adopt-a-school \nprogram, which encourages community and corporate involvement \nwith local education. In East Los Angeles, for example, Coca Cola has \nprovided over $100,000 to help keep Hispanics in the two high \nschools with the largest populations of Hispanics. The program, the \nCoca Cola Hispanic Education Fund, begins prior to high school with \nthe early identification of potential dropouts, early counseling, \norientation to high school, tutoring, and buddy systems linking \nteachers with students in need. s~ \nIf schools are to look for corporate help in the dropout problem, \nthe businesses that are solicited must be local and must have some \ninput into the program. That input can be in planning, placement, \nand/or evaluation of dropout prevention in the local area. Be that as it \nmay, the responsibility of the school remains that of developing the \nfull potential of each student. Roles of education and industry can \nonly be viewed in this light. .. \nIn many ways, dropout prevention is simply following approved \neducational practices. Basic skills are taught through application. \nResearch on the dropout, as on the curriculum for all students, favors \nthe use of a variety of teacher approaches, life-related content, and a \ndiversified curriculum without tracking. It emphasizes the importance \nof an individualized approach to instruction. Students need to be \nknown and recognized by staff and be able to gain recognition easily \nfor their accomplishments. But then this is true of all students. \nThe idea that I hope has come through in this chapter is that the \nbest dropout prevention is a good curriculum for all students. As \n', 'NELSON 241 \nBloom points out, an effective school for all students has three \nqualities: good teaching, enough time to learn, and remedial help for \nyoungsters as soon as they need it.  s2 There are no shortcuts and more \nof one quality cannot compensate for the absence of another. Time is \nneeded; schools tend to be nervous places. But time will not \ncompensate for poor teaching or for lack of special help for children \nwho fall behind. As one dropout stated: "The teacher didn\'t show \nyou too much. If you didn\'t get it the first time, the teacher didn\'t \nhave much time to show you." \nAt Willard Junior High School, as at many other schools, in- \nservice education has enhanced the clarity of instruction, with \napparently favorable results. It would, of course, be too easy to say \nthat students drop out only because they cannot understand the work. \nIt would be more hopeful to suggest that when schools are finally \nready to provide equal access to the curriculum--which includes how \nto teach as well as what is taught we will be close to the solution of \ndropping out. \nFOOTNOTES \n1.
