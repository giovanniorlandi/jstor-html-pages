In one of the\nmost complete reports ever made to\nthe legislature, the O\'Hara vice com\nmission declared yesterday that pov\nerty is the principal cause, direct and\nIndirect, of prostitution, after an in\nvestigation into the causes of vice\nthat covered three .years.\nThe report is unequivocal in this\nassertion. It declared that to arrive\nat any other conclusion would be to\ndodge the issue and points to the\nfact that 70 per cent of the mothers\nOf girls at the Geneva Home for-De-\nlinquent Girls, who were in employ\nment, were either washwomen or\nscrubwomen.\nSlightly under 70 per cent of the\ndelinquent girls brought into the ju\nvenile court of Cook county. were\nfrom families not supported by the\nfathers, where the mother had be\ncome the wage-earner and conditions\nof poverty were extreme.\n"This committee," the report de\nclares, "was unable to learn of-a\nsingle prostitute in any city in Illi\nnois visited, or-in which itst\'invesU-\n-Hmmmmmmmmmmmm', 'gators operated, who had come from\na home of even modest prosperity.\nWomen do not seek lives of prostitu\ntion except under economic pressure\nor economic expediency or under the\nhandicap of moral and-mental defects\nresulting from previous family eco\nnomic conditions.\n"Thousands of girls are driven into\nprostitution because of sheer inabil\nity to keep body and soul together on\nthe low wages received by them.\n"By the testimony of the girl vic\ntims, in one unbroken narrative of\nhopeless struggle; by the reports of\ntheir private conversations from ex\nperienced investigators; by the ob\nservations and judgments of social\nworkers whose integrity has never\nbeen questioned; and, over and above\nall, by the figures of what the girls\nare actually paid and what it actual\nly costs them to live; the hideous de\nficit and the more hideous contempla\ntion of how sometimes that deficit\nmust be bridged; is your committee\nbrought irretrievably to this finding.\nIt is not a matter of sentiment, or of\nemotion, or of opinion. It is the fact,\ncold, not nice, uncomplimentary to all\nof us; but nevertheless the fact"\nThe report which defines its mean\ning of prostitution to refer to girls\nand women who sell themselves for\nmoney and not to the act of immoral\nity when not compensated, declares\nthat a girl\'s hope of redemption after\nshe has errer grades downward with\nthe intensity of her struggle for ex\nistence and the hope of redemption\nis dimmest where the temptation is\nstrongest, with the girl whose wage\ncannot support her.\n"The girl in receipt of a living wage\nis not necessarily doomed by the ini\ntial folly," the report states. "She\noften redeems herself and is restored\nto the world of well-behaved, pure\nminded persons. The girl who is be\nlow the \'bread line,\' who is slipping\nweekly further and further into debt\nand misery, seldom recovers from the\nfirst moral lapse."\nThe report then goes into the tes\ntimony of the State street shopkeep\ners and mail order heads and xecord3\nthe admission of Julius Rosenwald,\nphilanthropist and head of the Sears\nRoebuck & Co., that 30.96 per cent\nof all of the females employed by that\nhouse received less than $8, after\nRosenwald had testified that an in-\nquiry was made by the heads of va\nrious departments among the em- \'\nployes.\nAfter showing by the testimony of\nthe employers that they believed the\ndeficit between the \'low wagethey\npaid and the least on which a girl\ncould live should be saddled by the\nparents, the report tersely shows how\nthis would work out, taking, as it\nfrankly admits after its investigation\',\nwhat is considered a high average\nwage for male employes, $15.41, ac-\ncording to the testimony of the\nbosses.\nThis amount it is shown is not\nsufficient to support two adults and\na growing infant and save money,\nand the child, under the labor law,\nmust be supported until it is 14. At\nthat age the girl goes to work and\nfrom 14 to 16 receives in the average\nplace $3 a week and from 16 to 18\nprobably $5 a week.\nThe deficit between her wage and\nthat which it costs to supply her with\nsufficient food, clothing and shelter\nduring.that time amounts to $832.\nThe father must meet the deficit with\nan economy prohibitive of many fam\nily necessities or go into debt In\neither case, the family environment\nis lowered and worry displaces the\ncontentment that is essential to sane\nmorals. tt\nWhen the girl reaches 18 the father\nhas reached the age barrier after\nwhich his earning capacity dimin\nishes. He is barely able to earn suffi\ncient for the necessities of life, and if\nthe girl then attempts to pay back\nthat deficit of $832 to her parents it\nwill take her earning from 18 and\nupward the average wage given by an\nemployer of $9.12 until sne is 32 to\nliquidate the indebtedness to her pa-', "'\nrents, provided she lives under the\nmost strict economy, and at 32, under\nthese conditions, should she marry\nand have children, the strain of the\nlong struggle would adversely affect\nthe coming generation even before\nbirth.\nThis illustration is based upon av\nerages the average parent, the aver\nage parent's age, the average girl and\nthe average girl's wage. If the girl\ndoes not recognize or does not at\ntempt to meet her parental obligation\nthe burden is not lifted from the fam\nily. It is fatal to the family's chance\nwhether the debt be assumed by pa\nrent or child. This is the answer of\nthe p'Hara committee to the bosses'\nargument that the parent should as\nsume the deficit between what em\nployers pay and the least amount\nupon which a girl can live.\nThe committee recommends as the\nessential initial step in the treatment\nof the problem of vice and low wages\nthe immediate enactment of a mini\nmum wage law, prohibiting the pay\nment of less than a living wage to any\nwoman or minor, except during a pe\nriod of apprenticeship not exceeding\nsix months.\nSuch a proposed law was strongly\nsupported by LieuL-Gov. Barratt\nO'Hara at the last session of the leg\nislation, but though several other\nstates have enacted such a law as a\ndirect result of the O'Hara investiga\ntion, Illinois defeated the minimum\nwage legislation.\nThe commission further recom\nmends improvement of condition of\ngirls in domestic service, and of girls\nfrom homes offering inadequate so\ncial opportunities by the opening of\nschool houses and all other available\npublic buildings as social centers;\nhours of labor of girls in domestic\nemployment to be regulated to permit\nof participation.\nEstablishment of homes for the\nadequate moral and industrial school\ning of women during the period of\neducation in. the pjubUc schools.

They were to join the twenty\nsluggers already in the pay of the\nEdwards Valve and Mfg. Co.\nThis chipper gang, most of them\nwith their pistols ready for trouble,\nstepped off the cars in the business\ndistrict of East Chicago yesterday\nmorning. This slugger business was\nold stuff to them; some had gone\nthrough the recent garment strike.\nUnder the" lead of Meehan, who\nwas a saloonkeeper until he saw a\nchance to make more money break\ning this munition plant strike, they\nswaggered around the town and\nthen started for the Edwards plant.\n.A bunch of strikers, about 150 of\nthem, gathered and stood by, watch\ning the strikebreakers. There was\nno disorder. The police of the city\nhad been called by frightened mer\nchants as soon as the "armed\nguards" debarked from the cars.\nAnd the word of the arrival spread\nto the Edwards plant Twenty "spe\ncial police" were rushed to the busi\nness district to "escort" the new\ncomers. The regular police met the new\nand nervous strikebreakers in the\nmiddle of the street on the way to\nthe plant and stopped them. The\nstrikers stood by and jeered, and the\nbody of "special police" from the\nplant, seeing the mob, came running\nto the spot\nThe nervous gunmen, fresh from\nChicago, pulled revolvers; the police\nalso drew their guns; the oncoming\n"special police" took out their weap\nons and strikers jeered.\nChicago recruits evidently mistook\noncoming plant guards for strikers.\nPlant guards saw their man Meehan\nin the midst of the gang of ruffians\nand they thought he was in trouble\nAn imported-gunman fired the first\nshot All authorities agree on thac\nThen a hundred more shots were ex\nchanged by the strikebreakers and\npolice. The police say the strikers\ndid not interfere. ,\nWhen the Chicago gunmen had\nbeen driven back by the city police,\nMeehan, head of the invading strike\nbreakers, was dead, shot through the\nhead either by the police or an ex\ncited slugger.\nTwo machinists, Howard Miller\nand Vernon Borne, part of the strik\ners who had gathered to jeer at the\nstrikebreakers, were struck by stray\nbullets. Policeman Kohusky, one of\nthose in the middle of the imported\ngang when the trouble started, was\nshot in the leg. Three "special po\nlice" of the Edwards plant were\nwounded.\n"The guards mistook their own\nmen-for enemies," was the verdict of\nChief of Police Bowen of East Chi\ncago after the battle. "The riot was\ntheir making. The company should\nnot have imported gunmen from\nChicago without letting us know\nthat they were coming."\nMayor Callahan of the city said the\nstrikers were in no way to blame for\nthe rioting.\nEleven strikebreakers and eleven\nstrikers are under arrest through the\nefforts of the county sheriff. The lo\ncal grand jury is investigating.\nMeanwhile the authorities of tEe\ncity have asked the Edwards plant\nofficials not to bring in any more\ngunmen of the type that shoot so\nreadily.\nThe men are striking for. a 20 per\ncent increase in wages. .The Ed\nwards plant, although masked by \'the\nname "Valve and Manufacturing\nCo.," is used for making shells for\nthe allies.\nFederal authorities investigating\nstrike today declared there is no evi\ndence of a "war plot" in the strike.\n&', "OUTBURSTS OF EVERETT TRUE\nTHE NSXT g5g5M\ncar cuicL jjT ,wEAigMBiMMMM\nHE KNEW JIM\nShe Your friend Jim was here\nthis morning asking for you and told\nme such a touching story.\nHe (absent-mindedly) For how\nznuch?i\nHAS SOME LEFT\nCountry Judge How long have\nyou owned a car?\nMotorist One week, your honor.\n, Judge Um, then you can still af\n'ford to pay a fine of $20.

Barnes, a Movie Fan, Examining a Film as It is Shown\nReady to Be Placed in the Projecting Machine at a Motion Picture Show\nHouse.\nEditor\'s Note. This is the first of\nthree stories giving the history of\nthe motion picture film. The next\nreel of this feature will tell what hap\npens to the film in the laboratory.\nBY A. FILM\nI am a motion picture film. I am\n17-16 inches wide and 1,000 feet\nlong. The first thing that happens\nto me at a motion picture studio is\nthat I am cut into 400-foot lengths.\nEach length is rolled into a tight lit\ntle reel and each reel is Inserted in\na tin can, which is then hermetically\nsealed.\nThen I go in my 400-foot segments\nto the camera man. Each camera\nman takes a segment of me into a\ndark room, lifts me out of the little\ncan and puts me into a funny look\ning box with a crank on it\nThen the camera man carries me\noutside, funny box and all, to the\nstudio where I am to work. The box\nis set up on three legs and after a\nwhile the director says, "Camera!"\nThe camera man begins to turn the\ncrank and I begin to run from one\nreel to another. I ga over some\nspools and things, passing in front\nof a little round glass, -where I get a\nfleeting glimpse of all the funny\nthings the actors and actresses are\ndoing. But the crank sends me\nalong so fast that I don\'t get time\nto see very much. I clatter along at\nthe rate of 16 exposures per second,\nwhich does not allow much time for\nobservation. It takes two turns of-\nmmmmMmmmm', 'the crank to run me a distance of a\nfoot\nI am pulled along past the little\nglass by little holes that are\npunched in the edge for me. These\nare called sprocketholes and there\nare four of them to every exposure.\nAn exposure is each glimpse I get of\nthe outside world as I pass the little\nglass called a lens. Some of the lit\ntle spools that I travel over have lit\ntle burrs on the outside rim of each,\nwhich \'fit into the holes that are\npunched in the edge of me. These\nspools are called sprocket-wheels,\nand they are what pull me past the\nlittle hole with the lens. There, are\n64 sprocketholes to every foot of me.\nSometimes I look at what is going\non outside from a great distance.\nThey call this a "long shot" And\nwhen the camera man carries me so\nclose\' up that I can see the wrinkles\nin the actresses\' faces it is called a\n"close-up." The camera man turns\nthe crank until the entire 400 feet of\nme is wound from the first reel onto\nthe second.\no o\nFASHION FRIVOLS\nBy Betty Brown\nThe suede glove is now matched\nby the suede hat Cunningest litle\nsailors in moss green suede, trimmed\nwith gold lace, or yellow wings, are\nthe most popular things in the milli\nnery world.\nThe chiffon handkerchief which\nhas no use for the laundry -is one\nof the pretty things that add to fem\nininity\'s attractiveness.

"No, sir! What with your hu\nmanities and your movies for crim\ninals nowadays, you are making the\npenitentiary a pleasant resort for the\noutlaws of the country."\n"I don\'t know," answered the gov\nernor thoughtfully, "I remember\nwhen I was warden at Salt Lake\nprison camp "\n"You initiated this modern system\nin our state, sir," said the district at\ntorney. "You never heard how I came to\nsee some good in the worst side of\nhuman nature, Mr. Elson?"\n"It doesn\'t exist"\n"So I thought," answered the gov\nernor. "I used the harsh methods of\nthe old days, the whip, the cooler and\nall the rest of it Well, it was Big\nSteve changed my viewpoint. He\nwas the worst nigger of the lot Why,\nwe\'d almost seared the flesh off his\nback and then we couldn\'t do any\nthing with him. He\'d half killed a\nwoman that was why he was sent\nup for a dozen years. Savagely at\ntacked the guards and his fellow pris\noners. But he hated me worst of the\nlot, and whenever I went near the\nfellow he\'d snarl like a mountain\nlion.\n"He got away one night We went\nafter him, four of us. I was among\nthem. You see, a prisoner\'s hatred\ntells on the nerves of his guards,\neven on those of the warden,, and\nwhen I heard the fellow had gotten\naway I didn\'t lose two minutes start\ning after him. What made it worse\nwas that he\'d managed to overpower\na guard and take his rifle.\n"There was a single cartridge in\nthe rifle. It was the practice to give\neach of the guards a loaded rifle\nwhen he went on duty. He had a few i\nother cartridges, too, but the rifles\nwere not the modern service ones,\nand one cartridge at a time was all\nthey held. Steve had the rifle. Why\nhe didn\'t kill the guard I don\'t know.\nMaybe-he thought he\'dhave use for\nthe rifle afterward, as proved to be\nthe case, v\n"He had about half an hour\'s start\nof us, and the route he had taken was\nperfectly plain. He had, in fact, only\none route .to take. That was around\nthe borders of the lake in the direc\ntion of the little railroad that car-\nu\n"Bring the Cigars, Steve,\nried the pine products down to the\ncoast Everywhere else was noth\ning but forest and swamp. There\nwasn\'t a house within miles. He\'d\nhave starved to death if he could\nmanage to escape the quicksands\nanywhere else. The prison camp\nhad been built wisely and well\n"We tracked Big Steve. We went\non foot, couldn\'t hope to catch up\nwith the convicf before we reached\nthe line, but we reckoned that he\'d', 'PPJPPUPPPWlPIPffW19\nhave half an hour to wait before the\nnight train came along, and it proved\nto be the case.\n"I was clean mad all through. I\nswore that I\'d retake Big Steve single-handed,\nif necessary. I had only\na revolver against his rifle, but the\nthree guards I took with me were\narmed to the teeth. As it happened,\nthe most unexpected ill luck hap\npened to us.\n" itvo, or my men got bogged in\nthe swamp. They were up to their\nwaists, and the rope that we\'d\nbrought with us to bind the prisoner\nhad to be requisitioned to pull them\nout It was near the end of the jour\nney and every second was precious\nto us. You see, there was no tele\ngraph in those days. We couldn\'t\nwarn the man at the station. We had\nto go in person. And it would be the\neasiest thing in the world for Big\nSteve to hop on one of the cars as\nthey lumbered down the hill and go\non any distance until he chose to\ndrop off and make his way, into some\nof the negro settlements along the\ntrack.\n"The third man stayed to pull out\nthe two who were mired in the\nswamp. It was not a difficult matter,\nfor one of them was near the edge,\nand when he was freed the two of\nthem could get Adams free. But it\nmeant ten minutes, and I was so mad\nwith hate that I didn\'t even stop to\nexchange my revolver for a rifle. On\nI went, in spite of the men\'s remon\nstrances, and, sure enough, I reached\nthe station a little ahead of the train.\n"I called the man on duty, but he\ndidn\'t show up. I found afterward\nthat he was drunk. Dead drunk and\nwhy not? It was a lonely life, and\nthere was no likelihood that anyone\nwould want him at that hour. You\nknow what our country types used to\nbe. There wasn\'t much more than\nluck to decide whether a man would\nbe a prison employe or an inmate.\nAll came of the same class.\n"I stood still, searching around for\nBie Steve. The train was already,\nwithin earshot, puffing up the grade\non the other side of the hill. I looked\naround and then in the moonlight I\nsaw Big Steve\'s face behind a tree, a\nhundred yards away, and his, black\nfeatures twisted with rage as he\nlooked along the barrel of his rifle.\n"He had me. Of course I fired. But\nI know I couldn\'t hit him at that dis\ntance. I emptied my revolver and I\nheard Big Steve laugh. Then I stood\nstill, waiting for the bullet.\n"I heard a savage snarl behind me,\nbut I didn\'t associate it with anything\nparticular. I was hypnotized, I sup\npose, just waiting for the negro to\nfire, and wondering whether he\'d kill\nme, or whether he would leave me\nlife enough to fight until the train\ncame\' along. But suddenly I heard\nBig Steve utter an exclamation. He\nhalf turned his head and the next\ninstant I heard the ping of the bullet,\nand the sound of, the discharge al\nmost at the same moment.\n"I wondered whether I was hit I\ncouldn\'t feel anything. I was just\n\'concluding that he had missed, and\nwondering what had \'distracted his\nattention, when I heard himyell:\n" \'Jump aside, boss! Jump for your\nlife!\'\n"I obeyed automatically. There\nwas something in his tones wholly\ndevoid of hatred. It might have been\na trick, of course, but I didn\'t think\nof that Next moment the body-of a\nhuge mountain lion came thundering\npast me.\n"The beast checked itself in its\nleap, looked up in my face, bared its\ngreat fangs in a snarl, stretched itself\nat my side, and died. I saw the bullet\nhole behind the shoulder. Big Steve\'s\nbullet had pierced its heart\n"And the negro sauntered \'up to\nme aimlessly, and stood grinning be\nside me. \'A narrow squeak, sure\nenough, boss!\' he remarked.\n"I took the rifle from his hand. Big\nSteve offered no resistance. I cov\nered him with my revolver until the\ntrain had gone by and xny men came\nup, but it wasn\'t necessary.\ni-iiMiiMMMaHiMl', 'I\n"That\'s all. We never lad any\ntrouble with the convict from that\nday on. But the event started me\nthinking, and all at once it came to\nme what was the matter with Big\nSteve. He had nearer been up against\na really elemental Human situation\nbefore that\'s all; nothing that show\ned him in his intuitive personality the\nfact that men are brothers. He was\nthe victim of his environment When\nI became governor I had him par\ndoned." The district attorney rose. "And\nprobably he committed half a dozen\ncrimes after that,\'"he remarked.\n"I don\'t thing so," answered the\ngovernor, pressing a belL "Bring the\ncigars, Steve," said the governor to\nthe negro who answered the sum\nmons.

F. Paine\nIn Los Angeles, where the moving\npicture concerns have invested mil\nlions in film plants, there is a hot fight\nfor abolishment of the board of cen\nsors and the decision will have effects\nall over the country, undoubtedly.\nMost of the local newspapers and\nbusiness interests that would defy\nthe Creator rather than "hurt busi-.\nutjBs involving minions are crusad\ning against any sort of official cen-.\nsorship, and here is their main argu\nment: "The basic idea is that the motion\npicture, like the press, is a liberaliz\ning educational power and that this\npower should not be restructed ex\ncept by the public itself. The mov\ning picture makes the poor man\'s\ntheater, and the poor man and the\nmiddle class man, whose morals are\ngood and whose ideals are high, will\nnot patronize pictures that offend\nthe proprieties or corrode morals."\nMost folks who have had much ex\nperience in this life become rabid\ndoubters toward any proposition to\nestablish public morality upon the\naverage of morals, and there never\nyet was brutal prizefight, dirty sex\nnovel or risque show. that did not\nfinally try to hide behind that old,\nold claim, "liberalizing and educa\ntional," the same old inducement that\nthe devil handed out to Eve in that\napple affair.\nFor what are movie pictures made\nand exhibited? Is it for liberalizing,\neducational purposes? No, but for\njust $$$$, and nothing else. "What\nsorts of movie pictures are most pa-\ntronized? Those which educate the\npoor man, the middle class man, and\nthe upper class man, too, and his wife I\nand children to the belief that se-\nduction of maiden or wife is common, I\ninteresting and very often results in \'\na good thing. Forty per cent of the I\nmillions who visited the \'Frisco expo.\npaid an extra admission fee to see\n"Stella," the picture of a nude worn- t\nan. What percentage of them did so\nmerely through desire to behold a\nwork of art? Most any honest man\nwith any worldly experience would\nsay 5 per cent perhaps.\nFact is, that when you undertake\nto base official action as to public\nmorality on the popular patronage\nof anything, your basic idea has got\nto be just what it is in your dealing\nwith the question of the liquor traffic\ngome men can drink and get along\nall right Some ought to drink a lit\ntle, according to about the only med\nical opinion offered in holy writ But\nto millions and millions, to public mo- ,\nrality, strong drink is an unmitigated\ncurse.\nThe most immoral picture that the\nmovie folks could produce would N\nhave no lasting deleterious effect\nupon a considerable proportion of\nmen of the poor, middle or upper\nclasses, but what about the effect of\nuncontrolled, dollar-hunting movies\nupon the wives and children of all\npoor, middle or upper class men?\nYour prizefight manager knows\nthat guarantee of knockdowns and\nbloodshed "draws."

Hall\nRogers complains of the lack of di\nversity in The Forum. This is a\ncommon complaint in all the avenues\nof life. It is made generally by those\nwho fail to recognize life and its pur\npose and thus failing find nothing in\ntheir existence that hold their atten\ntion and interest. Those who find\nsomething in life that is real and\nfundamental try to interest their fel\nlows in it, and so slow is mankind to\nlearn that nothing but repetition will\nproduce results.\nIt takes endless repetition to in\nterest the human intellect in the\nmerits of Biggies\' shaving soap, and,\nalthough there are things in the\nworld much more important, Biggies\nmakes a quicker impression on hu\nmanity than the important things.\nSo the important things must be\nbrought to the attention of people by\nconstant repetition.\nHenry George said: "Private\nproperty in land blocks the way of\nadvancing civilization. The two can\nnot long co-exist Either private\nproperty in land must be abolished,\nor, as has happened again and again\nin the history of mankind, civilization\nmust again turn back in anarchy and\nbloodshed. Even now I believe the\ninevitable struggle has begun."\n- Here is a thing that is yet new and\nyet old. It is more important that\nBiggies\' soap or prohibition, and yet\nit is obscured to the mass of man\nkind because it has not been repeat\ned often enough. Private property in\nland has ho foundation in justice.\nThe only title to property is the exer\ntion that produces property. Land\ncannot be produced. It is the source\nof production.

The many pro\ntests and suggestions by individuals\nand societies have hastened the settlement-of\nthe issues involved. The\njone question unexplained is and re\nmains: "What will the city receive\nfor waiving the right of forfeiture?"\nIt appears to me that the city will\nbenefit in many ways by acting like\na brother, no a father, to this Auto\nmatic telephone corporation.

Good\ntimes, prosperity and profit are the\nfoundation upon which are built\nhard times, poverty and misery. I am\nnot pessimistic, but am looking at\nthe humorous side of things. A na\ntion\'s prosperity depends on its abil\nity to run its industries with a profit\nfor private individuals. Profit is ob-\ntained by producing more than is\nconsumed, .tience ipw wages are\nrecommendable, insomuch as they\nprevent extravagance and tend to\ndecrease consumption (not referring\nto phthisis, which they increase),\nand long hours of work is good inso\nfar as they increase production and\nprofit, which is measured by the ex\ncess of production over consumption.\nSo far so good.\nBut here the trouble begins. There\nis always the -question how to dis\npose of this \'excess production. It is\ntrue the ignorant, hungry masses\nwant it and can use it, but they have\nno money, and, besides, what these\nignorant laboring masses use for\nthemselves is only an expense and\nno profit to our captains of industry\nand merchant princes, so that the\nless the laborers can be made to con\nsume the more profitable. There is\nno use to keep pn running; the indus\ntries and producing more\' and-\'more,\nif the surplus products cannot be\ndisposed of at ft , profit.-. So\' eventu\nally facfories"are shut "down J produc-\ni-atHmmmmmmmmm', 'fcjt\ntion is discontinued and there comes\nan era of unemployment, poverty\nand starvation.\nTo prevent such a state of affairs\nit is a nation\'s ambition to sell its\nsurplus commodities to foreign mar\nkets. But all civilized nations are\nconfronted with the same curse of\nprosperity. I mean the question of\nhow to dispose of their own surplus\nes. The competition between na\ntions to reach the world\'s markets is\nso keen and bitter that often the\nsword is resorted to as the only de\nciding factor.\n"A plague on our teachers," re\nmarked the famous English writer,\nIsrael Zangwill, in connection with\nthe present war. Really and truly\none plague is not enough for them.\nOur professors of political economy\nteach our young men that war is a\nblessing in disguise. For while the\nwar lasts the neutral nations are\nable to dispose of their overproduc\ntion to the warring nations at an\nenormous profit, and when the war\nis over the conquering nation is able\nto dictate terms of peace and dom\ninates the world\'s market, where it\ncan dispose7 of its surplus wares, and\nthe conquered nation is also bene\nfited by the war, which destroyed\ntheir surplus products land killed\nmany of their starving people, re\nduced competition among the re\nmaining workers and so enabled\nthem to set the wheels of produc\ntion in motion again, until the same\nprocess will be repeated again and\nagain.\nAnd so mankind travels in a cir\ncle, merrily chasing for profit, like a\nmad dog chasing its own tail Mean\nwhile we are advised by our-teachers\nto work our heads off to establish\nat public expense a merchant marine\nand nurse it along untif it will be\nstrong and profitable enough for pri\nvate capital to take it over. For, you\nsee, a merchant marine will save lots\nof money to the owners of our sur\nplus production to carry on foreign\ncommerce. If some foreign nation\nwill get jealous of our control of the\nseas, why, then let us work our lives\naway for preparedness. Do anything\nto help the rich employers make a\nprofit on what they squeeze out of\nyou as surplus production. Day\nBook Student.\nBUSINESS SUCCEEDS BLUS\nTER.

Well, it\'s an hon-?\nest fact, just the same.\nWhen Washington was fighting for\nthe freedom of a nation that is now\none of the biggest, richest and mos$', "powerful, his financial resources\nwere exhausted and he was in great\ndanger of being decisively defeated,\nas his soldiers were nearly half\nstarved. A young, very rich Jewish\nman named Morris, seeing this, gave\nup all his money to Washington and\nused many other means of getting\nmoney enough to carry on the war\nto a successful end. Can you imag\nine that? If it was not for a Jew we\nwould still be under the rule of Eng\nland. Was it appreciated? No!\nYou can't show me one school child\nwho knows about that\nWho are the great business men of\ntoday. Who are a great percentage\nof the politicians that run this pros\nperous country?\nJust to show you the difference?'\nSpain, years ago, drove all the Jews\nout of her country and. for many\nyears after did not permit a Jew to\nenter that country. What's the re\nsult? Spain is begging the Jews to\nreturn. The same can be said about\nPortugal. If these two countries\nwere business concerns they'd be\nbankrupt today!\nNow take Mexico.
