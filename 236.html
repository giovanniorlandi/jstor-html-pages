Two pro\ncrams will ho held each day, ono nt\nthree p. m. and another nt eight p.\nm. This plnn has hcon\'doveloped to\nenablor tho busy farmor and his en\nergetic wlfo to take care of tho day\'s\nwork before coming to the incotlngs.\nTho committee believes that the spir\nit of these meetings will be helped\nby the people bringing a light lunch\'\nwith them, so that between the af\nternoon and evening program, a pic\nnic Rupper may bo held on the\ngrounds. This will allow the farmer,\ntho business man and (heir families\nto chat with their neighbors and\nfriends, thus making these meetings\nreal community affairs.\nThe meetings will be held In a\nbig auditorium tent which will sea\n700 people (lulto comfortably. The\ntout la to bo lighted by electricity\nand a small motion picture machine\nwill bo \'Installed so that four of five\nreels of flno educational plcluro3\nmay follow tho ono, evening talk.\nTho Dopartment of Agriculture nl\nWashington, tho National Rd Cross,\nIho Stato IJoard of Henlt.i and tho\nPlate Commissioner of Hotul\'i will\nfurnish them dims.

Juno C, 1919,\nMy dear Mr. Editor: I am send\nlng to you a copy of my Good Itoads\nbill. I feel that your readors may lo\nInterested In this bill as I have de\nmands for copies of it from tho lead\ning business, commercial and agri\ncultural organizations all ovor tho\ncountry, Including tho press.\nMy bill piovldes tor tho appropria\ntion of n billion dollars to aid the\nstates and counties In tho construc\ntion of trunk- lino and Inter-county-seat\nroads. This sum Is to bo ex\npended within tho next four years,\nthe sum of $100,000,000 before June\n30, 1920, and three hundred million\nfor each of these years, ending June\n30, 1921, 1922 and 1923. It also\nprovides for turning oVer tho army\ntrucks and other war materials that\ncan be used profitably In the con\nstruction of roads to tho various\nstates and counties, to aid In tho con\nstructlon of these roads.\nWo havo spent sOmo three or four\nbillions of dollars In maintaining a\nlargo army and navy In this country\nand in Europo slnco the armistice\nwas signed. Wo are still spending\nmillions of dollars dally In this\ncountry. Tho last session of Con\ngress appropriated more than a bil\nlion dollars to take caro of tho guar\nanteed price of wheat, and the Rail\nroad Administration Is now asking\nfor more than a billion dollars to\ntnko caro of tho loss in tho opera\ntion of tho railroads under govern\nment control. Millions are being\nwasted on useless and unnecessary\noffices throughout tho country. Our\nboys are building roads In France.\nI want tho boys discharged, so that\nthey can return to tholr homes, en\njoy thein families, and help to meet\nand solve the problems of reconstruc\ntion. I want this waste cut out and\nmoney appropriated for roads. This\nwill help all sections of tho country\nand all classes of people and I am\nsure that one of these days Congress\nIs going to take an advance step on\nthis road question. It Is tho biggest\nquestion In America today, and It\nhas more supporters than any other\nquestion.\nIf you feel that It would bo of in\nterest to your readers to mention\nthis road bill and my reasons for\nproposing It, you may run this In\nyour paper and I shall greatly ap\npreciate It.\nWith very best wishes for the suc\ncess of your good paper, and of your\nself, I remain, Your friend,\nJ.
