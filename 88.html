The FOIA provides \nthat confidential financial information is \nexempt from disclosure. and the court \nfound confidentiality to rest upon the \nlikelihood that disclosure would \nsubstantially harm the competitive \npositions of the hospital from whom the \ninformation was sought. \nA federal district court in Richmond, \n"conscience law." which provides that \nno hospital shall be required to perform \nabortions, does not apply to nonsec- \ntarian, non-profit hospitals since \nthe quasi-public status of such hospitals \ndenies them the right to refuse to perform \nsuch procedures. \nPeepkoltheStatedNew Yorkv. \n%men\'s Chrlstina Assodntlon ai \nJamestown,Inc., 377N.E.Zd725.406 \nN.Y.S.Zd272(Ct. ofApp. 1978). \nThe highest court in New York has \nheld that a hospital not affiliated with \nBlue Cross may charge Blue Cross \nsubscribers more than the amount it \nwould have been reimbursed by Blue \nCross, thereby, obligating the patient to \npay the hospital the difference between \nreimbursement rates and the hospital E ~ U V .
