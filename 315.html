Kf, fort® to check the «weep of the j, tide which has dtrawa nine nations, into the conflict hare uniformly, failed, unless It may be considered, ecrtain that Italy will remain neu, tral. * . 4,,, Some sanguine spectators of the, vast upheaval haye argued from its, immense scope that It must soon, end. They have reasoned that i\'s, cost alone must quickly briug, about financial exhaustion and, compel peace. It seems to be for, gotten that as the srugs\'a widens, and the statistics of the war grow, more stupendous the resources be, hind the armies and the fleets are, correspondingly augmented. And, It should be borne In mind that the, wid*T the spread of the war the, uoi« complications must stand in, the way of pe*ce., r I* Is possible, for instance, that, Germany may be succeeful \' in, France and may beat back the Rus, sian invasion of Prussia, while the, two great insular powers, Great, Britain and Japan, may suffer only, comparatively slight losses and, may grow fat, in the commercial, sense, by the destruction, for the, time being, of German foreign, trade by sea and German maritime, competition. If that should prove, the case, how are they to be, brought into the same state of, mind regarding peace terms which, mar exist in France and Russia?, Who is to make Japan agree to, the conditions which Germany, if, successful on land, would surely, seek to impose?, Fey reasons such as these it Is, safe to say that guesses that the, war will soon be over are founded, more upon hope than on carefully, studied surreys of tha forces and, interests Involved.

The ability of Billy, Sunday as a descriptive, plain, and easily followed .war correspond- |, ent is proven by his account of the, meeting of David and Goliath in, the following every-day language;, "All of the sons of Jesse, except, David, went off to the war; they, left David at homo because he was, Oi.ly a kid. * After a while David\'s, ma got worried. She wondered- what, had become of his brothers, because, they hadn\'t telephoned her or sent, word.
