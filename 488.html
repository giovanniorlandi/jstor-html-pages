A NUMBER 41.\nRATIFY THE TREATY,\nSAY 259 LEADERS IN\nAMERICAN LIFE\nCall On Senate to Approve It\nWithout Amendment and\nWithout Delay.\nA written appeal for ratifica\ntion without delay or amend\nment of the Versailles treaty of\npeace with Germany has been\nsubmitted to every member of\nthe Senate signed by 250 lead\ning Americans, Republicans as\nwell as Democrats.\nThe address to the Senate is\nsigned by ex-President Taft, ex\nAttorney General Wickersham,\nPresident Lowell of Harvard,\nJudge George Gray of Delaware,\nPresident Gompers of the Amer\nican Federation of Labor, Lu\nther Burbank, Lyman Abbott,\nJohn Burroughs, Alton B. Par\nker, Oscar S. Straus, Jacob H.\nSchiff, Henry P. Davidson, and\nmany others, including Govern\nors and former Governors and\nSenators, and men and women of\nnational reputation.\nParty Lines Broken.\nThe text of the address fol\nlows: "In the Senate at Washington,\nnow that the Committee on For\neign Relations has reported the\ntreaty, the lines are\' sharply\ndrawn between the immediate\nratification of the treaty of\npeace with Germany and, its a\nmendment with a reassembling\nof the conference and a reopen\ning of negotiations that would\nbring great delay and and pro\nlonging uncertainly in settling\nthe greai issues of the peace.\nNo partisan plea can be made.\nParty lines are already\' broken.\n"\'-"Stamliur afS distance "from\nthe conflict in the Senate Cham\nber, we plead for immediate rat\nification without delay. Our\nland requires it. A state of ner\nvous strain, tension, and unrest,\nexists, manifesting itself in dis\nturbances which in some cases\nhave no self-evident connection\nwith the war, but which are, in\nfact, its aftermath. The world\nis put in imminent peril of new\nwars by the lapse of each day.\nDissensions\'between us and our\nformer allies are being sown. We\nfirmly believe and solemnly de\nclare that the States and cities\nin which we dwell desire imme\ndiate peace.\n"The waging of war steadied\nEstimates on\nIr \' -"\'\'\'- -.j\'\nif you want to know\njust how much the material for certain improvements\nwill cost you\nthe very lowest price,\' we mean\nask us.\nmaking estimates in a part of our buKinwm.

PRICE. Manager.\nand united the American people.\nPeace will bring prosperity, and j\nSenate postponing ratification\nin this uncertain period of\nneither peace nor war has\nresulted in indecision and\ndoubt, bred strife and quicken\ned the cupidity of those who Sell\nthe daily necessities of life and\nthe fears of those whose daily\nwage no longer fills the daily\nmarket basket.\n"We beseech the Senate to\ngive the land peace and certain\nity by a ratification which will\nnot keep us longer in the shad\nows of possible wars, but give!\nthe whole world the light of\npeace. Reservations in the na\nture cf" clarifications in the\nmeaning of the treaty, not in\nconsistent with its terms, will\nnot require the reopening of the\nnegotiations with Germany and\nwith our associates in the war,\nwhich we all and each united to\nwin.\n"But there is no possibility of\ndoubt that, amendment of the\ntreaty, as is now proposed by\nthe Senate Committee on For\neign Relations, would require ne\ngotiations and a reopening of all\nthe questions decided at Paris.\nMonths of delay follow. The per\nils of the present would become\nthe deadly dangers of the near\nfuture. All the doubt engender\ned would aid the plots for violent\nrevolution in this and other\nlands. The issue here and else\nwhere between capital and labor.\nthe conspiracy of speculator and\nprofiteer, would all grow, and be\ncome more perilous.\n"This cannot be. The Ameri\ncan people cannot, after a vic\ntorious \'war, permit\' its Govern\nment to petition Germany, which\nhas accepted the treaty, for its\nconsent to changes in the traty.\nYet if the United States should\namend the treaty for its own\npurpose and policy, Germany\nwould have full right to ask for\nconcessions.\n"Germany has agreed to make\nno claim in regard to enemy\nproperty seized in this country\nto an amount of $700,000,000.\nOur recent foe could ask for a\nreopening of this issue and of\nthe Lusitania claims. It could\nraise every question open before\nhostilities in regard to subma\nrine warfare and the treatment\nof its nationals in this country.\nLumber Bills\nAll the provisions for our trade j\nin Germany raised by the econ\nomic clauses of the treaty, many\nof them vital to our industries\nand our farms, as in dye pat\nents, dye supplies and fertilizers,\nthe working of the Reparation\nCommission which superintends\nthe trade of all with Germany,\ncould all be brought up by Ber\nlin for readjustment by our ne\ngotiators, acting for the United\nStates alone and no longer asso\nciated with other victorious\npowers or supported by a victo\nrious American army on the\nGerman border.\n"Peace itself, and peace of the\nworld, is delayed until ratifica\ntion comes. And any amendment\npostpones peace. Germany and\nEngland alone of the principal\npowers have ratified. The other\nprincipals necessarily await our\naction, influential and powerful\nas we are today in the world\'s\naffairs. The ravages of war on\nmore than a score of fighting\nfronts are continued by any\nneedless delay. Let the Senate\ngive the world peace by ratifica\ntion without amendment.\nEven the amendment for\nwhich most can be said, the pro\nvision in regard to Shantung,\nwill secure nothing which cannot\nbe gained if China, backed by\nthe powerful advocacy of the\nUnited States, addresses itself to\nthe machinery for righting in\nternational wrongs and meeting\niust claims created by the\nLeague between nations.\n"China after eighty years of\noppressive treaties and despoil\ned rights, by which all the great\npowers have profited directly or\nindirectly, ha, for the first tinvj\nin this covenant and treaty, the\ni i\nmeans ana memoa to secure\njustice and the removal of the\noppressive economic interference\nof stronger nations whose citi\nzens are within her gates pro\ntected by a long succession of\ninternational agreements. More\nover, it should be remembered\nthat the clause regarding Shan\ntung was made upon the state\nment by Japan that she will re\nturn the territory to China, and,\ntherefore upon that condition;\ncompliance with which promise\nthe League can require.\n"The peace of the present and\nthe righteousness of the future\ncan be hest secured by the rati\nfication f the covenant and\ntreaty without amendment. Let\nthe Senate take no action that\nwiy, give\' any party to the treaty,\nand especially Germany, ground\nfor maintaining that the ratifi\ncation of the United States is not\ncomplete and that changes re\nquiring a resumption of confer\nence and negotiations have been\nmade in it."\nCapt.

It seems al\nmost like the ease of a judge who\n(prepares the verdict for a jury\n1 to sign.\nIt is hardly unfair to wonder\nwhether this kindly concern for\nGermans has for its object those\nin Germany or those in the\nUnited States.\n"They shall not pass" may be\nthe slogan for the Republican\nCongress in its opposition to all\nthe bills they promised and all\nthe measures the President recommended.\nGeneral Pershing has lost no\nfriends and suffered nothing in\nprestige for his refusal to ap\npear before a Republican com\nmittee on "investigation" and\napoligize for winning the war\nunder a Democratic administration.\nSenator Johnson, who would\nrather be president than right,\nmust have felt like putting " a\nbomb under General Wood Sat\nurday night, when the General\nappeared on the platform just at\nthe moment when he was mak\ning his greatest bid for popularity.\nGeneral Pershing was backed\nto the limit by the President,\nthe Secretary of War, and the\npeople. He made the most of the\nopportunity and performed the\ngreatest task ever given a com\nmander. The Republicans are\nyet dumbfounded that it could\nbe done without playing politics.\nAttacking The Strongest Point.\nSenator Johnson is a burly rhe\ntorician. He should stick to his\nlast. He couldn\'t have found a\nmore blundering way of attack\ning the Treaty of Peace than by\nmaking his ill-conceived obser\nvations about it and the cost of\nliving, and Mr. Wilson\'s atti-\n1 tude thereto. "The ratification\nJ of the Treaty may increase ex\nj "ports, but increase in exports\ni "will not reduce prices at home."\nThat is a "specimen splinter of\nthe entire and perfect chrysolite\nof Mr. Johnson\'s economic sa\n! pience.\nI Were Mr. Johnson familiar\nj with the most rudimentary facts\njand necessities of commercial,\nifiniinniQl anA nrnnn vvi i r ti-nll Viz\ning, he would know that confv\ndence is its absolute condition\nprecedent.

That is why the Treaty\nshould be ratified. That is the\nprincipal, if only one of a hun\ndred, reason why this candidate\nfor President is utterly wrong\nand should have every business\nman against him. N. Y. Times.\nSenator Hiram W. Johnson in\nhis speech at Kansas City Sat\nurday night, made it plain that\nhe is not so much opposed to\nthe League of Nations as he is\nto President Wilson. His tirade\nagainst the President was the\nbest we have read, and his mis\nconstruction of many of the\narticles in the League compact\nbrought to many wavering\nminds a fuller understanding of\nthe character of the opposition\nto the League.\nThe sub-committee of the Sen\nate charged with investigating\nthe Mexican situation consists of\nAlbert B. Fall of the border\nstate of New Mexico, Marcus A.\nSmith of the border state of Ari\nzona, and Frank B. Brandegee of\nConnecticut. The first, a Repub\nlican, is an absolute interventi\nonist and a bitter critic of Ad\nministration policies; the sec-\nAN UNHOLY ALLIANCE.\nSome of the sensitive Repub\nlican Senators will easily find a\nnew grievance against President\nWilson for his assertion that the\nGerman element throughout the\ncountry is now active in its op\nposition to the treaty of peace\nand the covenant of the League\nof Nations.\nWhat the President stated,\nhowever, is a fact, and if he\nerred at all it was on the side\nof under-statement. The Ger\nman element everywhere is a\ngainst this treaty, for the rea\nsons that moved Senator Knox\nto advocate its rejection and the\nnegotiation of a separate peace.\nBut pro-Germanism i3 only one\nof many participants in this un\nholy alliance. Every element\nthat was disloyal during the\nwar has joined forces with Sen\nator Lodge and his Republican\nassociates who are engaged in\nwrecking the treaty. No other\nsuch combination was ever\nknown before to the political\nlife of the United States. It in\ncludes the extreme Republican\nprotectionists, who insist that\nNeckwear\nWe have received a new\nline of Organdies and\nLace Collars. Net Frilling\nfor Suits and Dresses. Al\nso tucked and fancy nets\nfor vestees.\nBSSSSSSSSSSH\nMcCAUSLAND\'S\nthe removal of "economic bar-\'\nriers" can mean only free trade,\nand nothing but free trade. It\nis idie to call their attention to\nthe fact than an overwhelming\nmajority of the Governments\nthat framed this treaty have\nprotective tariffs, and that none\nof them would have agreed to\na covenant that weakened their\ncontrol. They have made up their\nminds that some future Sched\nule K is in peril, and neither\nreason nor argument can move\nthem. With them are allied all\nthe Bolsheviki and Bolshevist\nsympathizers, including the In\ndustrial Workers of the World,\nwho are against the treaty be\ncause it is an obstacle to chaos.\nThe Bolshevist opposition is\nsimplicity itself. The treaty was\ndrawn by representatives o f\n"capitalistic government," and\ncapitalistic government must be\ndestroyed with all its works.\nHence the treaty must not be\nratified.\nNaturally,, the Sinn Feiners\nhave joined forces with the op\nposition, because Great Britain\nis a party to the treaty, and they\nprefer no peace at all to a peace\nin which Great Britain is a\nparty while the Irish question\nremains unsettled. The parlor\nSocialists and the radical intel\nlectuals have their own point of\nview, which is that Wilson,\nLloyd George and Clemenceauf\nfailed to make a perfect peace,\nand therefore the good is to be\ndestroyed with the bad. With\nthese are all the extreme paeii\nfists, who\' object to a peace ex\ntorted by force of arms, and all\nthe. imperialists, who object to\nany international arrangement\nto prevent wars and prohibit!\nconquests.\nUniting all these arious ele\nments are the professional Re\npublican politicians who control\nthe House and the Senate, and\nwhose one object is ttf discredit\nPresident Wilson, on the theory\nthat if he is sufficiently discred\nited a Republican President will\nbe elected in 1920, and that with\na Republican administration in\npower it matters little what hap\npens to the American people and\nthe world in general.\nt\nThere have been many strange\ncoalitions in the course of Amer\ncan history, but never before\nwas there one like this or one\nthat combined so many ele\nments of real danger to the wel\nfare of the American people.\nSt. Louis Post Dispatch.\nHedge Posts For Sale.\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday.\nAugust 26th and 27th, I will\nsell about three thousand hedge\nposts ranging from regular\nfence posts to excellent shed and\ncorner posts.

The field plowed was\nlevel wheat stubble land and a\nmoist silt loam. The average\nplowing depth maintained was\nseven inches. In cost of fuel per\nacre, the tractors ranked in the\norder named, the cost varying\nfrom 39.7 cents to CG.7 cents.\nAll but one used kerosene for\nfuel.

Among the highly\nyielding plants it is well to pay\nattention also to the form of\nthe plant itself. The ears should\nbe chosen from strong, stocky\nplants which stand erect in re\nsistance to the wind. However,\nthe total yield of the plant and\nits early maturity are the main\nconsiderations, and no character\nistic of the plant or ear should\nbe allowed to interfere in the se\nlection for these features.\nMODIFY TREATY\nAND YOU KILL IT\nMinority in Foreign Relations\nCommlt ee Thus Challenges\nReport of Lodge Majority\nWORLD PEACE IN BALANCE\nUntil Treaty Becomes Effective Fer.\nment in Financial and Industrial\nWorld Will Continue.\nLoafing Hens Starting to Market\nPoultry culling campaigns un\nder the direction of the exten\nsion service of the University of\nMissouri College of Agriculture\n. are heading many hens toward\nthe market. If hens are not lay\ning eggs they are fit only for\nfood,, and the quicker they are\nmarketed the smaller will be the\nfeed bill for the flock. In Perry\n- County, 736 non-laying hens\nwere culled from 1608 fowls ex\namined the first week of the\ncampaign. At one farm, 41 hens\nwere culled from a flock of 49\nThe owner was pleased with the\nwork, says County Agent Raut,\nas she had been getting only 4\nto 6 eggs a day, and was satis\nfied the laying birds were among\nthe eight retained. In the second\nweek, 31 farms were visited. Of\nthe 1982 fowls examined, 542\nwere culled as non-layers. The\npercentage of culls seems to run\nabout the same in all the farm\nflocks. In Vernon county out of\n1353 hens examined in 21 dem\nonstrations, 664 were culled.\nFertilizer for Wheat and Clover\nOf the three elements common\nin fertilizers.-nitrogen, phos\nphorus and potassium.-nearly all\n.Missouri soils are in greatest\nneed of phosphorus, especially\nfor the wheat crop. For that rea\nson, we are recommending under\npresent conditions, acid phos\nphate or steamed bone meal on\nall soils of medium to good fer\ntility. On thin washed hill sides\nit is advisable to use a little nit\nrogen and still apply as much\nphorphorus as possible. For such\nconditions a mixed phosphoric\nacid is recommended.\nAcid phosphate and mixed fer\nilizers should be used at the\nrate of 150 to 200 pounds to the\nacre while bone meals may be\napplied at the rate of 125 to 150\npounds to the. acre.\nWhile numerous field trial\nshow that available phosphates\ndrilled in with wheat are prac\ntically certain of giving a profit,\nnot all of the benefits are shown\nin. this first crop. Where clover\nis to be sown in wheat, the\nchances of securing a stand are\nmuch improved if a phosphate\nfertilizer is used liberally. Next\nto a need for lime clover de\nmands a liberal supply of phos\nphates. The many Missouri soils\nthat are sour should have this\ncondition first corrected with\nlime and a phosphate then used\nwith the nurse crop. Fewer clov\ner failures would then occur.\nField Selected Seed Corn.\nSelect seed in the field from\nthe highest yielding plants\nwhich are growing under aver\nage conditions of spacing, fer\ntility, and moisture. It is not e\nnough merely to select the seed\nin the crib, says W. C. Ethe\nridge of the University of Mis.\nsouri College of Agriculture\nfor one can have no notion of\nthe conditions under which the\ncrib-selected ear was produced\nIn selecting seed from the field\nattention should be paid to the\nmaturity of the ear. Only well\nmatured ears should be chosen\nfor it is desirable above al\nthings to select a strain which\nwill thoroly mature within the\ngrowing season.

The more general\nly the people of the United States\nabsorb our government securities the\ngreater will be the ability of the com\nmercial banks to devote practically\nall of their resources to furnishing\nadequate credit to the commerce and\nIndustry of the country.\nProviding short-time credit to com\nmerce and Industry is their normal\npeace-time function. The sale and\nmovement of farm crops, manufac\ntured products and other commodities,\nas well as the continuous and efficient\nemploym jt of labor, in fact, the whole\nindustrial process will be promoted\nby permitting the commercial banks\nto devote all their resources to this\nfunction.\nThe people of the United States\nBhould, therefore, be encouraged to\npay off their installments and borrow\nings on bond collateral as rapidly as\npossible, and also purchase additional\ngovernment securities as Issued from\ntime to time or in the market. If this\nIs done the people of this country\nwin be benefited In a two-fold way.\nIn savlue to oav their loans and In\nstallments and also\' in order to buy\nadditional Liberty Bonds and notes.\nTreasury Savings Certificates and War\nSavings Stamps, they will refrain\nfrom waste and unnecessary expendi\ntures ana thus rree material and la\nbor for the production of commodities\nwhich are now .so desperately needed\nthe world over. At the same time they\nwill be strengthening themselves fi\nnancially. No one can do better than to make\na substantial proportion of government\nsecurltiea the foundation of his invest\nment fund. Nothing else will give\nsuch sound and unfailing support to\nhis entire financial structure and at\nthe same time yield such excellent re\nturns. The less one can afford to\nrisk his funds, the less time he has\nto devote to his Investments, and the\nless experience he has had in the,\nthings which are daily affecting the\nvalues of ordinary bonds and stocks,\nthe larger should be Ue proportion of\nhis funds Invested In securities which\nneed practically no attention, which\nare acknowledged by all to be abso\nlutely ssfe, and which yield a satisfac\ntory return.\nTherefore, on account of the direct\nfinancial benefits to the Investors, on\naccount of the Indirect assistance\nwhich It will give the government, and\naccount of the effects in bringing about\nnormal financial, Industrial and liv\ning conditions, I bespeak the co-operation\nof all the people and especial\nly of all saving and Investment insti\ntutions in the promotion of nation\nwide saving and the distribution of\nUnited States securities among the\npeople.\nMOTHER QOOBC UP-TO-DATE,\nMary, Mary, quite contrary,\nHow do your savings growT\nA Thrift Stamp here, A War\' Stamp\nthere,\nYields "crops" when "ill winds\nblow.
