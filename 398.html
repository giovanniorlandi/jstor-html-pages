From\nOakdale, Stanislaus county, California, comes tho an\nnouncement thai the Carnegie library at Medford is a fail\nure and the city would like to get rid of it. Tho Oakdale\nGraphic contains the follewing:\nTho only difficulty regarding a Carnegie Library that wo havo over\nheard is that with reference to tho library In Medford, Oregon. Where\nthero is ono city dlteatlsfled, It Ib safo to say thero nro hundreds that\naro morethnn pleased. A city that Is going down hill might object to\nkeeping tip .ch a library as Medford has, but tho cities of California aro\nnot going In that direction. Oakdale certainly Is not, \'\nPassing the slur upon Medford, which iliio be expected\nfrom California towns, the uncalled-for and unjustifiable\nattack upon the public library is anm\'.ing. Jt would be\ninteresting to learn the source and object.\nThe assertions made are false in evory particular. The\nCarnegie library has given universal satisfaction and\nproved a great convenience to the city, as Avell as a source\nof profit and pleasure to thousands. It has bad a very\nrapid growth, and despite constantly increasing facilities\nfinds it difficult, to keep up with public demands. . .\nNo portion of iho taxation is more cheerfully paid or\nmore wisely expended than that for the library and the\nonly regret is that more funds are not available.\nTf a vote were taken today upon the continuance of the\nlibrary, it is safe to say that thero would not be a vote cast\nin the citv against it.\nA NEW USE FOR PARCEL POST\nCLAIMING that the Southern Pacific is trying to put\nhim out of business by delaj\'ing shipments of news\nprint, in order to oblige the local octopus, the Klamath De\nvelopment company, whose collar he refuses to wear, Pub\nlisher Sam Evans of the Klamath Northwestern lias1\nstarted a novel boycott of the railroad by shipping in his\nnews paper by parcel post.\nIn a signed editorial t)ic publisher declares war to a\nfinish upon the Southern Pacific, cencluding:\nMeantime tho Southern Pnclfic will get as Utile of my business as Is\npossible for it to have.

Until a now schedulo is put\nInto effect by tho Postotflco Department, tho railroad loses money on all\nheavy packages that It carries for Undo Sam. We should worry. None of\ntho railroad officials have put their automobile in hock yet.\nHere is a new use for the parcel post. It suggests un\nlimited possibilities for isolated communities where the\nfreight rate is high. It causes a good deal of annoyance\nto the railroads, if not actual financial loss, but it guaran\ntees speedy delivery, for railroads dare not delay mail ship\nments to suit the whim of employes or satisfy the grudge\nof big shippers.\nCOLT BORN WITH\nMURDERER\'S FACE\nON REDDING FARM\nREDDING, Cnl., April 2.

It is quite difficult to ob\ntain a profit on pasture which Is on\nland worth $100 or more per acre.\nDuring drouth seasons, the pasture Is\noften so poor that it affords little or\nno feed, hut the interest on the In\nvestment, nnd the taxes must bo\nfound. There is no question but\nwhat tho use of tho silo for summer\nfeeding will make rapid gains during\ntho next few jears and will soon\ncome Into common use. The millions\nof tons of corn stalks and rough for\nage which are now annually going to\nwaste will find use In the form of\nsllngc and will make possible not\nonly a cheaper production of stock\nnnd stock products, hut will also\nmake It possible to increase tho profit\nof stock raising. Farmers who arc\ncomplaining of low profits from cat\ntle, should make a study or tho silo,\nas they will find a means to increaso\ntheir profits nnd do this with less\nlabor.\nTho silo Is n forage bank which If\nput into goricral use will save a vast\namount of valuable feed and bring a\ngreat wealth to our people.\n(lien! neliil, is lieinij ill pln,vetl ill\nIJie piesenl (into iu Seventh eonipiiii,\nn f fnirs.
