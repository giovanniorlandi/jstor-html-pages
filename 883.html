It is unnecessary that we, attempt to eiilnrye upon what lias, already been written and read in, the New Years additions of the, Itreat Denver papers which, have, as usual devoted hundreds of vol, umes to the greatness of Colorado, nun magnified her manifold resurc, es. her graudure of mountain scen, ery and her wonderful climatic, conditions., It is our purpose on the other, hand, to give attention to interests, nearer home und devote what little I, time and Bpnce we have to the, largely superior and natural ad, vantages possessed by that portion, of the gr?at state of Colorado, the, Western Slope, It is a fact which, may be easily demonstrated that, the portion of this state lying west, of the great continental divide, the, Saguache range, Marshall pass aud, Tenessee pass comprising that por, tion of tiie state lying west of the, ICXi meridian with Leadville prac, tically on the dividing line between, Eastern and Western Colorado,, each portion of which may be said, to embrace a small empire within, itself. It is a fact beyond contro, versian that this western half has, now, and is conceeded to hold with, io its confines, by far the greatest j, resources of the state and from, which ia already coming the larg, est revenues., A mention of n few leading towns, of our Western Slope will evidence, these facts. Of mining centers,, Aspen, Crested Butte, Pitkin, Ou, roy, Telluridt, Creede, Lake City,, and Silvertcn may be named of, primary importance. These cities, are contributing annually a hund, red or more million dollars to the, wealth of the people and state., | To the mines discovered within, the mountain ranges of this West, ern Slope, we owe the founding, and sucessivo growtli of these sev, eral towns. This soon led to the, building of two railway systems, over the continental divide and, into the heart of the mining camps, and compassing encli towu with, iron tracks and drove their 6purs, up to the foot of every mine shaft, tunnel mouth or tramway. It can, not lie disputed, that the greater, Colorado of today, came principal, ly from the development of the, Western Slope mineral resources, Denver, now recognised the metrop, olis of the Western continent, holds, this supremacy through the many, millions of dollars contributed ill, gold and silver annually from the, metal mni\'S As to the future of, metal mining industries among the, numerous and extensive mineral, ■zones together with the greatly, varied character of ores and the, comparatively small development, done as yet, it is safely conjectur, ed that the beginning is only found, in . very camp. Hundreds of old, Inbundoued prospects lie waiting, for new and practical Lauds to dis, CRESTED BUTTE, GUNNISON COUNTY. COLORADO. JAX U ARY 7, iqoq., | discover, some of which will doubt, less make mines not unlike the olil, Camp Bird has done for Thomas, Walsh. Thousands of mines are, sti\'l in the embryo slate which only, require a longer period to put them, in production and pay. No person ,, having a knowledge of the past and, present conditions of the ininiug, interests upon the Western Slope,, can doubt but that the future will, be greater than the past has been,, and in which will be seen more big, tmterprisee going, more men ern-1, ployed and more satisfactory re-\', suits obtaiued. The old time pros- j, pector is now be ini\' supplanted by i, a generation better qualified to tak ±, the field through having practical, and theoretical knowledge of the, requirements necessary to insure, the lushest success. The up-to, date miner and prospector is the i, oniy one who sail .hope for success, iu these times when new metals, aud nevuses for them are before, the public,.as also, new methods, for testing aud treating all classes, of ores ami metals., Second in order, to the natural, resources of the Western Slope,, may be mentioned the coal depos, its, which comprise ail area in ex, cess of that found in any other, state in the Union. In addition to, the extent of coat measures we may, add that outside of the state of, Pennsylvania, no other state pro, duces as good fi-quality of bituini, ■ lions or anthracite coal ns Guam, soil county on Slope, ! of the state of Colorado. For more, than twenty years there been, going from this not less, than u thousand R*»d, dimin\' much of this \\]kiod this, amount has been doubt At. With, the advent of the double tracking, of the K»o Grande and the Colo,, rado & Southern hues, which is, now considered to be but a few, months off, it is safely predicted, that the coni shipment from Gun, nisoti county will go up to many, hundred car loads per day and that, the Missouri river will not see the, further end of its transportation, Eastward, while shores of the Pa, vifii ocean will alone limit its traf, fie Westward Relative to the fu, ture demand and production of, of coal from the great coal measur, es ol the Western Slope, we can, predict that this matter rests en, tirely with transportation facilities, furnished to the producers., There are the great staked plains, lying between the Rocky mount, ains and the Missippi river East, ward, and uow given over entirely, to a teeming population, while on, Westward, seen from Utnh to, the coast, are liuudreda of new, mining camps springing into life, and witli no fuel supply save that, which must come from the great, Western Slope coal mines. No, possible doubt remains respecting, our coal mining industries. The, supply is in.\'xhaustfihle, the de, maud uuliinited, so consequently, the business must be enduring., Comparing the natural advant, eges, pertaining to the Agricultural, resources of Western Colorado, as, against those held by the Eastern, portion of the state, it will only be, necessary to see both sides during, the Spring or Summer season, to, determine which has most favoring, conditions. After crossing over the, Continental divide at Marshal pass, or elsewhere, it becomes apparent, at once to the observer, that he, has entered a conntry presenting, far different aspects from that seen, on the plains or upon the foothill, ranges. The scene has changed, from long stretches of barren and, dried up soils, to one slu wing vast, areas of mountains, hills and val, leys, covered with black loams,, from which all manner of vegeta-, I tiou springs, clothing all with the, I mantling green. Instead of dried, : up streams or stagnant pools, clear, • running brooklets course down the, mountain side to the low lauds,!, and form which flowing Westward |, ns the Gunnison and the Grand j, rivers, and finally, the great Colo-j, rado, whose waters at last reach, the sea in the gulf of California.\', ,It is unnecessary that we call to!, mind the magnificent prospect be j, fore the agriculturist of this great !, western continent, which has now, determined its future. Its orchards, and fruillands are unsurpassed for, quality or yield. Small grain, hay, j aud vegetables have shown abund, 1 ant crops and the grazing lands art-, I every where in night among the, ! surrounding hills and covered with, luxuriant grasses, The beat sugar, industry lias come into this section, as a demonstrated success and, many millions of pounds of sugar, are annually manufactured while, the future production will only !>♦*, limited to the demund for this, article of diet.

ALLEN, Fo*4 3—riaHrt, Author of “Eating for a, • J*arp<w#.” " Thm jVetw, Gospel of Health.”, Etc., iCopyrlght. by Joseph U. Howies ), MILK FOR BABES-BUT, TERMILK FOR ADULTS, All authorities on diet say that, milk is a perfect food. This is true, in a sense; and in another it is alto, gether untrue und misleading., The natural food of the infant Is, mother\'s milk. Hut the appalling mor, tality of infants is due chiefly to the, cow\'s milk, carrying the seeds, of disease from the cow, the air and, water, and planting them in a soli, mdd© favorable by Improper feeding,, lack of fresh air. bathing and ex, ercise. Not even cereal starch kills, more Infants between the ages of one, and six than does milk in the first two, years., Cow’s milk differs materially from, the infant\'s natural food, containing, twice as much proteld and only about, half as much sugar, but the danger, lies more In the contamination of the, milk sold in the cities. Fortunately, good work is being done in many, places to remedy this evil., Milk Is called the perfect food be, cause it contains all the elements nec, essary for the growth of the infant,, and in the proper proportion. Hut the, physical constitution and development, of the Infant differ much from those, of the adult, and the food should dif, fer accordingly., The growth of the infant In the, first six years Is rupid, and a large, proportion of lime Is necessary to, build the bony framework. Milk Is, In this respect an appropriate food for, the Infant and Inappropriate for the, adult. The lime of milk being little, needed for maintaining the bony, framework of the adult. Is largely de, posited in the arteries, contributing to, the distinctive disease of old age—, hardening of the arteries., The prime cause of hardening of the, arteries, which is also a cause of, "heart failure" and of certain forms, of Insanity. Is auto intoxication, or self, poisoning, resulting from the ab-, of waste matter from the, lower part of the alimentary canal, of, which I shall have more to say in deal, ing with "Ilread," In a subsequent ar, ticle., Deficiency of Iron in the blood of the, adult Is serious; the percentage of, Iron In cow\'s milk is small, corre, sponding to the nervous Inactivity of, the infant. In this particular milk Is, a very unsatisfactory adult diet,, though It sustains life Indefinitely., Hut the unsultabflity of milk to the, adult Is more evident on comparing, the Infant with the adult anatomy and, physiology: In the Infant, for in, stance. the upper part of the alimen, tary canal is almost a straight tube,, allowing the milk to pass quickly to, the Intestine, which Is adapted to its, digestion. The adult stomach Is a, deeply curved pouch, which In certain, abnormal conditions retains the food, for several hours longer than the, proper time for digestion. The fer, mentation of milk alone is not alwnys, serious, but the fermentation of meat,, cereals and fruits In the stomach,, through the agency of milk, leads to, serious results., The proportion of Iron in the blood, Is very small, bst very Important., When It Is found to be deficient, it Is, very difficult to supply It. Probably, Its best source is the brown part of, wheat which Is excluded from our, fine patent white flours, of which we, I shall speak later. Grapes. the, part of wheat, cabbage (raw), and lettuce readily supply iron., It has b«*en found that persons living, exclusively on milk lack ‘‘sand/’ a, quality which the Infant never needs, to display, since it is absolutely de, pendent., In flesh-eating animals the stomach, and liver are much Inrger in propor, tion than In the vegetable-eaters. An, apparent exception is fotind !n the, ruminating animals, like the cow., which gathers a large quantity of food, and stores It in the first of a series of, stomachs for future chewing. The de, velopment of the food tube indicates, the food adapted to the animal. Al, though the infant digestive organs are, better adapted to milk than the adult\'s,, they are not perfectly adapted to, cow’s milk. To feed a dog or a child, of two years on "what we eat our, selves" indicates a sympathetic but, thoughtless disposition., Sterilized or boiled milk is open to, the same objection as roasted peanuts., Its vitality, its real life giving quali, ties are largely destroyed., It Is most unfortunate that our peo, ple are ignorant of the value of goat’s, milk, especially for Infant feeding., The goat Is the healthiest of all ani, mals and the. slowest to degenerate, when domesticated. Rarely, if ever,, is the goat known to contract tuber, culosis or any other disease. The, milk is superior In every way to cow’s,, and the poorest can own a "poor man’s, cow," which can be fed on the potato, v peelings, cabbage leaves or anything, [else that Is clean., , Hardly any other food Is compat, ible with milk, except uncooked,, whipped eggs, rice or toasted bread., Flesh meat, being a stomach food. Is, particularly Inharmonious with milk., The Jewish Instructions on diet pro, hlblt eating meat and milk together,, though this may be for an ethical, reason., The writer has recently made sev, eral days’ tests of an exclusive milk, diet on himself and others, carefully, recording results. A change from, the ordinary mixed diet to any mon, odiet is beneficial, and milk is not, an exception. Hut the benefits de, rived from the milk diet which have, recently been much advertised should, be credited to the monodiet, avoiding, the Injurious effects of mixing several, Incompatible foods at the same meal., Equally satisfactory results can be, shown from many other mAnodiets—, even the peanut, which Is the most, concentrated of all foods, containing, an excess of albumen. Great gains, have been recorded from exclusive, diets of beans, oatmeal, wheat, etc., as, well as milk, pursued for 60 days or, more., • • • •, Prof. Metchnikoff, head of the Pas, teur institute, who has made most, praiseworthy investigations into tho, causes of our early decay, has con, cluded that the failure of the average, man to live his natural term of life,, 100 years, is due to the development, of pathogenic germs In the lower part, of the food tube from Improperly di, gested. superfluous food, and recom, mends the use of buttermilk as an, antidote., The chief causes of the offending, conditions in the colon, the large intes, tine. leading to a constant poisoning, of the stream of life, are: Too much, food, eaten hurriedly; too much starch, and not enough fruit, and bad combi, nations of foods, good in themselves., Huttermilk is not a natural corrective, of these abnormal conditions, although, it no doubt serves as an antidote, nor, it the "internal bath,” good in away,, the true remedy; tho cause should be, removed., It has been said that "wine Is the, milk of age," and of unfermented wine, this is true. The grape contains much, sugar, acid and Iron, which aro de, ficient In milk. The most noted case, of prolonged life In history, that of, Cornaro, the Venetian nobleman In the, sixteenth century, was due to a uni, form diet, consisting chiefly of unfer, mented wine with an egg daily. The, egg supplied the fat. sulphur and al, bumen deficient in the "light wine.", or grape Juice, nroken down at 40 by, Indulgence In eating and drinking. Cor, naro lived to be more than 100 by sim, ple living., You enn make the best buttermilk, any day In your own kitchen. And, there is nothing better for digestive, disorders, and especially for latest Inal, troubles, or as a substitute in infant, feeding. In certain cases., You can get at the drug store tab, lets containing tho lactic acid bac, terluin culture that will convert sweet, milk Into full cream buttermilk by, simply dropping a tablet Into a quart, bottle of milk and maintaining the, proper temperature, according to the, instructions. Not only because this, fulj cream buttermilk contains the fat, In emulsified form is It better than tho, buttermilk you buy of the butter, milk &an. but because the lactic acid, bacterium prevents the development, of Injurious bacteria In the milk. This, is Important In the case of Infants., Cholera infantum, some forms of, diarrhoea and perhaps typhoid can be, avoided in this way. Here is tho most, important practical application of the, germ theory yet made, a boon for in, fant humanity, a recovery In some de, gree of the loss due to departing from, nature In Infant feeding as a result, of departing from nature in other, ways., It has long been known that butter, milk is a valuable food medicine —, even when soured by lightning. We, can not always command the thunder,, but science has discovered how to, make buttermilk without a churn and, without lightning, and without sepa, rating the butter. Hutterless butter, milk is good, full-cream buttermilk Is, better in most cases., Cow’s milk is digested by the infant, with difficulty, often resulting In com, plete breakdown of the digestive and, nervous system; but the adult diges, tive system ia not so well adapted to, the digestion of milk and hence flatu, lence and absolute revulsion often re, sult from its continued use. Hut, buttermilk causes no such difficulties,, because It is in a sense largely pre, digested, the coarser curds of the, casein in cow’s milk being finely, broken up., This removes the greatest objection, to cow\'s milk as a diet for infants and, as an ideal monodlet for adults in, severe stomach and bowel troubles., A certain amount of fat is necessary, to the best conditions for normal, nutrition, and fat is about 2V4 times, more valuahW as a heat nnd energy, producer than other forms of carbon;, and of the fats, butter is the most, easily assimilated, except peanut and, olive oil. But emulsified as the fat is, in milk. It is much more easily assimi, lated than as butter. For this reason,, and for others, the new way of making, buttermilk gives a much more nutri, tious product and more digestible, es, pecially for the infant., Cow’s milk cannot be made identical, with the Infant\'s natural food, but It, can be approximated to It. The chief, difficulty to be overcome is to adapt, the large curds that tend to remain in, the stomach longer than they should,, as the development of the calf\'s stom, ach requires that its food shall have, a much heavier curd than that re, quired by the infant in which intes, tinal digestion Is more important. The, use of buttermilk tablets obviates this, difficulty, besides overcoming other, objections to the uso of cow’s milk., But the objection naturally arises, that soured milk is not natural. The, reply is that cow’s milk Is not natural., Certainly tests of buttermilk have, nroved It verv satisfactory., THE EARTHQUAKE, HORROR GROWS, NUMBER OF DEAD IN ITALY AND, SICILY MAY REACH, 150,000., CITIES DEPOPULATED, SEVENTY THOUSAND OUT OF, NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE, DEAD IN MESSINA., Rome.—That 110,000 persons per, ished in Reggio and Messina alone is, now the appalling belief. The minis, ter of marine’s estimate ib that the, i total loss in the calamity is 115,000,, j but that these figures will be increased, • is the opinion here., | Of the ninety thousand population of, j Messina, 70,000 are believed to be dead,, I while 40,000 were killed or drowned, lor burned in Reggio. Both cities are, obliterated. AnJ thousands of in, | juied are dying and other thousands, i siuiving because Reggio cannot be, reached. There is every reason to lx*, ! iHisaimlstic over the situation. At Pal, \' mi 425 bodies have already been dis, covered., It is said the deaths at Htiguara are, 1,000, at Bonte Bafftmta 1,600, and at, | Seminara 400., On account of the interruption of, all communications no aid can be ink-, I cn to the wounded, who will die of, coid and Injuries. Thousands are ex, posed to the rigors of winter without, ciotlilng., Ur so. the prefect of Reggio, sends, the following from Oeraco Marina:, "As a result of the earthquake the, town Is almost entirely destroyed., Many thousands were killed. The pre, fecture and other public buildings are, in ruins. Other towns in the province, arc almost entirely destroyed. Send, help at once, especially food and med, icine, as the town contains nothing., Tho telegraph lines and railway* are, interrupted. Several hundred soldiers, were killed.

The ceiling col, lapsed. tho floor opened and 1 was, thrown into the first floor compart, ment of Mme. Pemicl. She was, searching for sister and son. whom, wc found dead. We remained all day, and night alone without help, keeping, the rain off with planks., "Thus we were without food or, dunk, among the screams of the bn, lied The latter ceased somewhat at, night. No one came with assistance, and we were its if in a tomb alongside, the bodies.

When we finally es, raped from the ruins, we were taken, by sailors to the Cristoforo Colombo,, which brought us to Naples., "Messina is entirely destroyed. I, fear 100,000 are dead. Our men could, save but a few. The Palnzzato on the, .sea, is standing. The town hall, in, tile center of the city, was burning, whe.i we left and conflagrations were, bursting out on all sides., ’We passed through the streets that 1, felt as though they wore the bottoms, of valleys, or climbed heights which, were all that remained of the finest, palaces of Messina.
