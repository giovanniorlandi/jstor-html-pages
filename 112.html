SUNDERMAN\nThe Civil Rights Project, Harvard University\nJAMES S. KIM\nUniversity of California, Irvine\nThe federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) expanded the federal role in American\neducation, and by doing so altered the distribution of power among the federal government,\nstates, and local districts. When the law was enacted, it was unclear how this change in the distribution\nof power would play itself out. This study examines the developing set of relationships\nbetween federal, state, and local officials under the new law and the factors that have contributed\nto a growing conflict over implementation. To fully understand the implications of NCLB\nrequires examining these interactions as well as understanding the substantive educational\nissues it raises. We identify three factors that contributed to the growing dissatisfaction with the\nlaw, namely, the Bush administration’s approach to federalism, the states’ limited capacity to\nmeet the new requirements, and the fiscal constraints facing state governments. We argue that\nthese factors have contributed to the conflict with federal officials, eroded state commitment to the\nlaw, and complicated implementation efforts.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), enacted by Congress in 2001,\ndeparts from the traditional role the federal government played in education,\nboth in terms of the law’s requirements and its sponsors. By\nrequiring specific changes in the basic assessment and accountability \n', '1058 Teachers College Record\nsystems of states, establishing timelines for improving student achievement,\noutlining specific sanctions for low-performing schools, and com-\nmanding many other forms of specific state action, NCLB has expanded\nfederal power to regulate education. Bipartisan support for the bill\nmeant that both parties agreed to continue along the path of standardsbased\nreform and accountability for student achievement. While both\nRepublicans and Democrats had reservations about the legislation and\nthe changed definition of federalism it entailed, both saw an opportunity\nto achieve their goals. For the Republicans, the risk of increasing the role\nof the federal government in education, an area traditionally considered\nthe prerogative of states, was particularly delicate since they advocated\nlimited government and states’ rights. But it did offer them a chance to\nuse federal power to increase test-based accountability and to insert market\naccountability principles into education. The Democrats anticipated\nthat the expanded federal role could be used to increase access to a quality\neducation. \nWhen Congress enacted NCLB, it was unclear how the change in the\ndistribution of power within the federal system might play itself out, or\nthe extent to which top-down reform could influence the educational\nchange process. To be successful, such reforms needed to develop strong\npolitical constituencies, professional support among those responsible\nfor implementation, and widespread agreement by the American public\non the need for reform. To achieve the goals of either the Democrats or\nRepublicans would require cooperation among federal, state, and district\nofficials within a system where traditionally the federal role was limited,\nand influencing education and enticing local cooperation required\nstrong incentives or extensive federal oversight.1 Yet early indicators suggested\nthat the complexity of the new law as well as political and ideolog-\nical conflicts will preclude a predictable and cooperative implementation\nprocess. \nWithin two years after this legislation was enacted, conflict over the law\ngreatly increased as more and more states passed resolutions to opt out\nof the law or otherwise expressed their dissatisfaction with elements of\nthe law. By early 2004, a number of states had passed or introduced resolutions\nseeking relief from the law’s requirements or limiting the state\nrole in implementing the new mandates. This “state rebellion” extended\nacross the political spectrum, with Utah and Virginia passing some of the\nstrongest and most widely supported resolutions.2 While this put both\nDemocrats and Republicans on the spot since both had supported passage\nof the law, the Administration was particularly defensive since it had\nmade education reform a centerpiece of its domestic agenda. In an effort\nto soften some of the requirements and avoid a major overhaul of the leg-\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1059\nislation during an election year, the U.S. Department of Education (ED)\nrevised some of the regulations. \nThis study examines the developing set of relationships between federal,\nstate, and local officials under the new law and the factors that have\ncontributed to the growing conflict. To fully understand the implications\nof NCLB requires examining these interactions as well as understanding\nthe substantive educational issues it raises. Our focus is on the status of\nfederal-state relationships during the first year of implementing NCLB.\nIn the following section we examine NCLB within the context of federalism,\nbeginning with a discussion of the literature on federal-state rela-\ntions and the role of the federal government in educational reform. We\nthen trace dissatisfaction with the law and its requirements among state\nand district officials and local educators. The next section examines\nthree factors contributing to the growing dissatisfaction with the law,\nincluding the Bush administration’s approach to federalism, the limited\ncapacity of state departments of education to meet the new requirements\ncombined with short implementation timelines, and the fiscal constraints\nfacing state governments. We argue that these factors have contributed to\nthe conflict with federal officials, eroded state commitment to the law,\nand complicated implementation efforts. We conclude with a discussion\nof the implications of our findings for the future of NCLB and suggestions\nfor the direction of future research. \nOur analysis of federal-state relations is based on multiple sources of\ninformation. Similar to previous research on federal policy implementation\n(Kingdon, 1995), we conducted semi-structured interviews with fed-\neral policymakers and administrators in the U.S. Department of\nEducation, including the Office of Elementary and Secondary\nEducation, the Office of the Under Secretary, and the Office of\nInnovation and Improvement. In Congress, we interviewed staff for\nSenator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Senator Judd Greg (R-NH), and\nRepresentative George Miller (D-CA), three lawmakers who were instrumental\nin drafting NCLB. We also interviewed legislative policy directors\nof several national advocacy organizations with an interest in education\nand state government (Council of Chief State School Officers, Council of\nGreat City Schools, National Conference of State Legislatures, National\nGovernors Association). In addition to the interview data, we examined\nthe NCLB regulations and guidance, policy letters issued by the Secretary\nof Education, and speeches by the President and Secretary that were\nobtained from the U.S. Department of Education web site. We also\nreviewed reports issued by the U.S. General Accounting Office on NCLB\n(General Accounting Office, 2002, 2003a, 2003b) and newspaper articles\nfrom across the country. \n', '1060 Teachers College Record\nTo gain the states’ perspective on federal-state relations and the implementation\nof NCLB, we interviewed state officials in six states (Arizona,\nCalifornia, Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Virginia) that were selected\nas part of a larger study on NCLB.3 These included interviews with state\nsuperintendents, key state department of education administrators\nresponsible for interpreting and implementing the NCLB requirements,\nand members of state boards of education. We also reviewed state-consolidated\napplications for federal funding under NCLB and state account-\nability plans submitted to the U.S. Department of Education to comply\nwith NCLB. Finally, we monitored state web sites for information on state\nefforts to implement NCLB and for state policy documents developed to\nmeet the NCLB requirements. \nFEDERAL-STATE RELATIONSHIPS IN EDUCATIONAL REFORM\nLiterature Review\nOne facet of American federalism is the relationship between the federal\ngovernment and the states, and how the federal system operates to\nachieve particular policy objectives. In education, the federal government\nhas played a limited role by providing additional resources targeted\ntowards particular types of students, such as disadvantaged children or\nthose with disabilities. Still, within this limited framework, implementation\nof federal education programs requires the cooperation of local offi-\ncials and the development of a professional cadre of people committed\nto the policy and the program. Intergovernmental conflict has arisen\nwhen the administration of programs was politicized, when there were\nserious economic or fiscal difficulties, or when administrative officials\nlacked autonomy vis-à-vis their elected officials (Peterson, Rabe, & Wong,\n1986). \nResearchers who have examined the federal role vis-à-vis the states have\nfound that policy implementation evolved as programs matured. In the\nearly stages of implementing a new policy or program, there was often\nbureaucratic ineptitude, misuse of resources, or concessions to special\ninterests as well as conflicts between local priorities and federally initiated\nprograms (Odden, 1991; Peterson et al., 1986). As programs matured,\nconflict was replaced with cooperation, and implementation was facilitated\nby the development of internal professional expertise and an exter-\nnal political support structure, which worked formally and informally to\nput a program in place (Odden, 1991). Conflict was greater when state\nand local officials were asked to carry out responsibilities that differed\nfrom what they might have initiated on their own, and cooperation was\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1061\nfacilitated when policies reinforced local priorities (Peterson et al.,\n1986). \nTo develop this professional expertise and the political support structure\nrequired to implement federal education programs, a process of\nmutual accommodation evolved where policies from above were shaped\nto fit local circumstances, while at the same time, local conditions\nchanged in response to reform (Amrein & Berliner, 2002; Kaestle &\nSmith, 1982; Knapp, Stearns, Turnbull, David, & Peterson, 1991;\nLoveless, 1999; Murphy, 1971; Odden, 1991; Peterson et al., 1986).\nClearly, local context shaped local implementation. Still, while collaboration\nbetween federal and state officials and federal deference to local pri-\norities exemplified the operation of federalism, federal education policy\nhas become more regulatory over time (Manna, 2003), with the national\ngovernment increasingly determining policy priorities and giving state\nand local governments the responsibility for implementation (Cibulka,\n1996). Under regulatory federalism, the state role changes from collaborative\ndistribution of federal resources to regulating the implementation\nof the federal requirements in local school districts. \nDefining the Policy and Governance Challenges under NCLB\nNCLB has some continuity with the ideas in the Clinton administration’s\n1994 Improving America’s Schools Act (IASA).4 IASA was notable for\nmandating that challenging standards apply to all students, including\nthose receiving Title I services. States were required to develop content\nand performance standards, adopt annual assessments that measured\nstudent progress against those standards, and hold schools accountable\nfor the achievement of all students. Schools and districts receiving Title I\nfunding were required to demonstrate adequate yearly progress that was\n“continuous and substantial” and that linked progress to performance on\nassessments (P. L. 107-110, Sec. 1111(b)(2)(B)). It was up to the states to\ndefine adequate yearly progress goals. State educational agencies were\nrequired to provide support to districts and schools and to help them\ndevelop the capacity to comply with the law. Districts were required to\nidentify schools in need of improvement that had not made adequate\nprogress as defined by the states, and were given the authority to take corrective\naction against a school. There was very little enforcement of these\nideas under the Clinton administration, and few states had made substantial\nprogress in meeting the IASA requirements. \nWhile many of the NCLB concepts were present in a less developed way\nin IASA, NCLB departs from its predecessor in major ways (see Table 1\nfor a summary of policy changes). NCLB raises the expectations and\n', '1062 Teachers College Record\ngoals of Title I policy by emphasizing equal educational outcomes.\nIndeed, an important goal of NCLB is to close “the achievement gap\nbetween high- and low-performing children, especially gaps between\nminority and non-minority students, and between disadvantaged children\nand their more advantaged peers” (P. L. 107-110, Sec. 1001, (3)). To\nnarrow the achievement gap, NCLB imposes strict timelines for improving\nthe achievement of disadvantaged students and mandates specific\nsanctions for schools not performing well. In contrast to IASA, states have\nto adhere to federally determined timelines for identifying failing\nschools and improving student achievement, establish adequate yearly\nprogress goals, and ensure teacher quality.5\nTable 1. Summary of policy changes in the 2001 ESEA reauthorization of Title I \nPolicy Changes\n•  Emphasizes equal educational outcomes\n•  Imposes timelines for improving student achievement \n•  Adds subgroup accountability \n•  Mandates specific sanctions for schools not performing well that relies on exit strategies or the transfer\nof money away from public schools\n•  Expands the testing requirements to all students in public schools and establishes a timeline for implementing\nthe new tests\n•  Defines proficiency as test scores in reading and mathematics\nWhile IASA required states to disaggregate assessment results, NCLB\nadds subgroup accountability for economically disadvantaged and limited\nEnglish proficient students, students with disabilities, and students\nfrom major racial and ethnic groups. Schools failing to make adequate\nyearly progress targets for any subgroup for two consecutive years are\nidentified as “in need of improvement” and, thus, are subject to a series\nof sanctions, ranging from public school choice to school reconstitution.\nSanctions are no longer at the discretion of local districts but are specified\nin the law. Moreover, through the use of sanctions, NCLB introduces\nthe idea of exit from the public schools and the transfer of money away\nfrom poorly performing schools as strategies for school improvement\n(Hirschman, 1970). This contrasts sharply with the idea of reform under\nprevious federal education policy, where low-performing schools were\ngiven additional resources and flexibility to coordinate Title I programming.\nNCLB also expands testing requirements, requiring students to be\ntested annually in Grades 3-8 in reading and mathematics and limited\nEnglish proficient students to be tested in English after three years in the\neducational system. States are responsible for developing and adopting\nthese tests, but they must implement the new tests according to a sched-\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1063\nule established by the federal government.6 These requirements extend\nto all students in public schools and not just those receiving Title I funding,\nas in the past. More so than IASA, NCLB narrowly defines profi-\nciency as tests scores in reading and mathematics. \nBy expanding the federal role in education, NCLB affects the politics\nof education and raises fundamental issues about who controls education.\nFirst, it alters federal-state relationships by expanding the role of the\nfederal government further into a primary function of state and local\ngovernments. NCLB now decides what constitutes a failing school and\nwhat should be done about it. It dictates the pace of change by setting\ntimelines for implementation and school improvement and requires participation\nin the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) as\none measure of student performance. By requiring “highly qualified\nteachers” in every classroom, it infringes on a basic state function to regulate\nthe teaching profession. Second, it affects governance arrange-\nments within states by favoring state education agencies and chief state\nschool officers over the governor, legislature, and state and local boards.\nBy directing federal funds to state education agencies, it gives them the\nauthority to administer the federally funded programs without necessarily\nconsulting with elected officials, and enables them to make commit-\nments with the federal government without considering how their decisions\nmight affect state policy and state budgets (Michelau & Shreve,\n2002). By placing additional accountability responsibilities on state educational\nagencies, it expands state authority over local boards to define\nwhat counts for proficiency on reading and mathematics tests. Finally,\nNCLB introduces the market principle that competition will create\nincentives for under-performing schools to improve. Within this framework\nof competition, it also shifts the focus of Title I from programs\ndesigned to improve schools to programs aimed at individual students by\nrequiring under-performing schools to offer transfers and supplemental\neducational services to eligible students. \nGrowing Political Opposition Within the States\nWhen federal power is expanded, state and local opposition is to be\nexpected until professional and political support for new reforms is built\nand institutions are developed to sustain a new policy direction. In the\ncase of NCLB, there was growing ambivalence towards the legislation\namong Republican as well as Democratic leaders and increasingly vocal\nopposition among state and local policymakers and educators. As implementation\nproceeded at the state and local levels, many of the issues that\nhad not been adequately addressed in the bill became apparent as polit-\n', '1064 Teachers College Record\nical leaders began to understand how the law’s provisions affected state\nand local priorities. At the same time, the Administration’s approach to\nimplementation and federal-state relationships did little to quell the\ngrowing opposition to the law. \nAmong state-elected officials, NCLB did not garner the sustained political\nsupport necessary to insure implementation. Early on, the National\nConference of State Legislatures opposed the legislation as an unwarranted\nintrusion on state power, and the nation’s governors raised con-\ncerns about the cost of NCLB. In February 2003, the National Governors\nAssociation released a policy statement, agreed to by both Republican\nand Democratic governors, that labeled NCLB an unfunded mandate\nand called for greater flexibility and additional funding to support\nNCLB. The governors, who generally supported the intent of NCLB,\napproved a policy statement requesting, “. . . in fiscal year 2004, the federal\ngovernment provide funding for federal mandates and programs.”\nThey made it clear that they considered NCLB a federal mandate and\ncalled for a more “responsive federal-state partnership.” With NCLB, the\ngovernors supported “maximum flexibility for states and school districts\nto combine federal program dollars and pursue our own strategies for\nraising student achievement” (National Governors Association, 2003,\nWinter Meeting). \nDissatisfaction with the law and its requirements among district officials\nand local educators increased as they began to see its effects on schools\nand local priorities. In Chicago, Arne Duncan, the CEO of the Chicago\nPublic Schools, criticized the act as creating enormous bureaucratic burdens\nand called it “a complex and impractical new mandate that sets\noverly ambitious yearly improvement standards” (Duncan, 2003). He was\nparticularly critical of the adequate yearly progress provisions that identified\n365 out of 600 schools (61%) in Chicago as needing improvement in\n2003-04, and questioned whether the NCLB transfer options would help\nimprove student learning. “Only in Washington would they devise a system\nto punish schools that improve, instead of rewarding them for mak-\ning gains. It sends the wrong message” (Duncan, 2003). \nEducators questioned the legitimacy of the NCLB school improvement\ndesignations, particularly when they conflicted with the state accountability\nsystem. A school could be labeled as needing improvement under the\nfederal system, but be considered performing adequately under the state\nsystem. As one principal in a northern Virginia suburban district\nobserved, NCLB is “not a meaningful way to judge schools. The state has\na far better plan in terms of looking at accreditation—that’s still our\nfocus” (Helderman, 2003). \nAs sanctions went into effect, particularly the requirement that districts\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1065\noffer students the option to transfer to another public school, dissatisfaction\nwith the law and its effects on local schools spread. New York City\nPublic Schools, under Chancellor Joel I. Klein, approved 8,000 transfer\nrequests in fall 2003, contributing to the worst overcrowding of schools in\nyears (Winerip, 2003). This angered principals and parents who had to\nput up with the overcrowding, as well as the teachers’ union and state\nassembly representatives. Representative Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn,\nQueens) introduced the School Capacity Relief Act (H.R. 947) that\nintended to “authorize local education agencies to prohibit the transfer\nof students under section 1116 of the Elementary and Secondary Schools\nAct of 1965 to schools that are at or above capacity, and for other purposes.”\nIn Chicago, district officials limited the number of transfers based\non school capacity. Still, receiving schools were openly opposed to accepting\ntransfers, fearing the new students would pull down their test scores.\nIn some cases, the transfer policy undermined local goals. For example,\nthe transfer plan went against a policy adopted by the local school council\nat one Chicago high school, which aimed to reduce enrollment while\nlimiting the number of students from outside the community (Adkins,\n2003). \nAs implementation proceeded, dissatisfaction with the law reverberated\nwithin states where policymakers voiced concerns about local con-\ntrol and the costs of implementing NCLB. These issues cut across political\nand ideological lines. Lawmakers, including many who initially had\nsupported the goals of NCLB, now saw the law as overly punitive and lacking\nadequate funding. In Virginia, the House passed a resolution calling\non Congress to exempt states such as Virginia, which had a well-developed\naccountability plan in place, from the NCLB requirements. The res-\nolution called NCLB “the most sweeping federal intrusion into state and\nlocal control of education in the history of the United States, which egregiously\nviolates the time-honored American principles of balanced feder-\nalism and respect for state and local prerogatives” (House Joint\nResolution No. 192, passed January 23, 2004). Legislators believed the\nstate had an accountability system that set high standards and a demonstrated\ntrack record of school accountability and improved student\nachievement. They were concerned that the changes required by NCLB\nwould undermine the success of their program. The resolution passed 98\nto 1, with the lone dissenter a Democrat. \nAfter extensive lobbying by the Bush administration, the Republicancontrolled\nUtah House modified a law that would have prohibited the\nstate from participating in NCLB. Instead, the law was amended to prohibit\nthe state and local districts from implementing NCLB unless there\nwas adequate federal funding (H.B. 43 1st Sub, passed February 10,\n', '1066 Teachers College Record\n2004.). Other states, including Vermont, Hawaii, Connecticut, North\nDakota, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire passed similar resolutions.\nTracking by the National Conference of State Legislators identified 31\nstates that considered resolutions or bills during the 2004 legislative session\nrequesting waivers, more flexibility and/or money, or that would\nprohibit the state from spending state funds to comply with NCLB or\neven participating in the NCLB program (National Conference of State\nLegislatures, 2005). Moreover, in March 2004, the chief state school officers\nfrom 15 states sent Secretary of Education, Rod Paige a letter asking\nfor more flexibility in determining which schools were making adequate\nyearly progress.7\nThe extent of the opposition to the NCLB legislation is unprecedented\nin its scope and depth.8 While many of these resolutions were symbolic,\nthe number of states passing or introducing them as well as the number\nof Republican states opposing the legislation sent a powerful political\nmessage to Washington. To understand how we arrived at the point\nwhere so many states were actively rebelling against the law, we turn now\nto an examination of the Bush administration’s approach to federal-state\nrelations, the state fiscal crisis, and the limited capacity of the state\ndepartments of education to implement the requirements.\nFEDERAL-STATE RELATIONS: CONFLICT OR COOPERATION?\nThe Bush Administration and Federalism: An Activist Administration\nTraditional views of federalism see the federal government stepping in\nwhen state and local governments would not otherwise provide a public\nservice at sufficient levels (Peterson et al., 1986). Thus, for example, categorical\nprograms targeted funds to disadvantaged students and students\nwith disabilities that were not adequately served by local educational\nagencies. On the other hand, conservative views of federalism emphasized\nthe prerogatives of state and local governments as the legitimate\nsources of policy and supported the devolution of social programs to the\nstates (Nathan, Gais, & Fossett, 2003). This view supported local decisionmaking\nwithout interference from the federal government and assumed\nthat states would invest funds in ways that would achieve particular policy\ngoals. At times, Republicans have used the federal bully pulpit to change\nthe education agenda or to meet international and economic goals,\nwhich was the case during both the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations.\nWith NCLB, the objectives of Republican reformers have changed\nfrom limiting the federal bureaucracy and decentralizing decision-mak-\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1067\ning to the states towards an activist bureaucracy that assertively promotes\nparticular political and policy goals. However, the rationale of the Bush\nadministration for reversing long-held Republican doctrines and expanding\nthe role of the federal bureaucracy in education has not been fully\nstated. The administration has dodged the issue of local control by asserting\nthat the law gives local school districts greater flexibility in the use of\nfederal funds and by arguing that the new testing requirements do not\ndictate what is taught or how it is taught (Godwin & Sheard, 2001). \nIn other words, the Bush administration’s approach to federal-state\nrelationships has been to ignore the traditional protocol of federalism\nand the role of state and local governments in policymaking and implementation.\nEarly on, the Bush administration indicated that it would\nstrictly enforce the new requirements, particularly the implementation\ntimelines. The presumption of this administration was that unless the\nadministration took a firm stand, states would “game the system.”\nHowever, the administration’s rhetoric alienated the very groups whose\ncooperation was necessary to facilitate implementation. When states\nbegan to re-define what it meant to be proficient in reading and mathematics,\nSecretary Paige sent a sharply worded letter to the chief state\nschool officers. In this letter, he accused some states of “trying to “game”\nthe system for short-term benefits” and of lowering “the bar of expectations\nto hide the low performance of their schools.” He went on to say:\n“Thus, it is nothing less than shameful that some defenders of the status\nquo are trying to hide the performance of underachieving schools in\norder to shield parents from reality” (Paige, 2002). In a similar vein,\nwhen an article in the New York Times (Winerip, 2003) criticized the\nNCLB transfer provisions, Nina Rees, Deputy Under Secretary in the U.S.\nDepartment of Education responded in a letter to the editor (Rees,\n2003), stating: \nThe concept behind the [transfer] provisions is to prompt states\nand districts to think strategically of ways to provide all students\nwith a high-quality learning environment. That Chicago, Los\nAngeles and other districts may be limiting students’ choice to\ntransfer has more to do with their reluctance to move their systems\nforward and provide an equitable education for their stu-\ndents than it does with flaws in the federal law. \nThe administration also acted assertively to advance its preferred educational\npolicies. In keeping with the administration’s priorities, ED\nstrictly interpreted the testing requirements. The lack of flexibility stemming\nfrom narrow interpretations of the law, especially as it pertained to\n', '1068 Teachers College Record\nassessment, so angered Virginia officials that the president of the Virginia\nBoard of Education included a letter of protest when the state submitted\ntheir final accountability plan in June 2003 (Virginia Board of Education,\n2003, June 9): \nLet me state for the record that we are “agreeing” to these\namendments only because USED has mandated them, and we\nagree only under strong protest. We do not believe these amendments\nrepresent sound or rational policies, especially the inten-\ntion of USED to apply future testing policies, to which we have\nalready agreed, to this past academic year on a retroactive basis\nfor the purpose of determining AYP for Virginia schools. We also\nobject for the record to the mandate regarding the testing participation\nof children with disabilities in possible violation of the\nchild’s Individualized Education Program and another federal\nlaw, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. \nThe final regulations on NCLB, released in November 2002, did not\nease the burden of implementation for states or districts and left states\nwith little of the flexibility they had hoped for. In particular, states wanted\nmore flexibility in determining adequate yearly progress (AYP), and to be\nallowed to continue to use indices that measured the extent to which\nschools and districts were making progress towards improving student\nachievement. Districts wanted more flexibility in identifying schools for\nimprovement and implementing the student choice options. Districts\nwere also concerned that the regulations would limit their flexibility to\nassign paraprofessionals to schools and programs, and that the teacher\nqualification requirements would exacerbate teacher shortages in critical\nareas, including special education, bilingual education, mathematics,\nand science. To a large extent, the concerns of state and district officials\nwere ignored. It was not until February 2004, after the law had been in\neffect for over two years and there was growing resistance among the\nstates, that federal officials began to ease some of the regulations\n(Sunderman, 2006).9\nIn writing the regulations, ED was constrained by the specific requirements\nof the statute itself in some areas, but in other areas, the adminis-\ntration’s policy priorities shaped the regulations. Most notably, ED narrowly\ninterpreted the issues of capacity and public school choice, mandat-\ning that lack of capacity did not preclude a district from offering public\nschool choice to eligible students in schools identified for improvement.\nThe regulations required that if a district identified a school for improvement\nafter the beginning of the school year, that school must immedi-\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1069\nately begin offering public school choice (Federal Register, Vol. 67, No. 231,\nSec. 200.32(f), 2002). Those with alternative interpretations argued that\nsince the statute provides that public school choice be implemented “no\nlater than the first day of the school year following such identification,”\nthat this could mean the following year and not immediately. Districts\nargued that these regulations would require them to alter the timelines\nfor the administration of tests, analysis of the data to determine adequate\nyearly progress, and the identification of schools in need of improvement.\nThey also argued that the choice requirement conflicted with dis-\ntrict choice processes already in place. Additionally, the NCLB choice\nregulations had none of the civil rights protections that were typical in\nthe earlier federal magnet school requirements or in the 1964 civil rights\nacts. \nNonetheless, under NCLB some areas will be easier to enforce than\nothers. According to the Director of Policy in the Office of the Under\nSecretary (C. Wolfe, personal communication, December 10, 2002): \nWe recognize that we are limited by the statute in some respects\nand we can’t go after states that don’t make adequate yearly\nprogress on that front. But, in terms of actually doing what the\nlaw requires—providing choice and not playing games—there is\na serious commitment to seeing the law implemented well. \nProfessional Compliance and State Capacity to Meet the New Requirements\nEnforcement of NCLB during the first year focused on compliance monitoring,\nadhering to implementation timelines, and meeting technical\nrequirements of the law. Intergovernmental coordination and cooperation\nbetween state educational officials and ED administrators facilitated\nimplementation at the state level and helped states meet some of the initial\ntimeline requirements. In January 2003, ED granted early approval of\nthe state accountability plans in five states. Apart from the public relations\nbenefits this early approval bestowed on the Administration, these\nplans provided states with a measure of what ED approved, what was\nrejected, and a model that states could refer to as they developed their\nown plans. The Council of Chief State School Officers used these plans\nto provide technical workshops and to help state assessment directors\ndevelop their own accountability workbooks (P. Sullivan, personal communication,\nJanuary 22, 2003). \nState education officials met the deadlines for submitting the\nConsolidated State Application to ED.10 All fifty plans were submitted on\ntime, a remarkable accomplishment given that states varied in the degree\n', '1070 Teachers College Record\nto which their state accountability plans aligned with the NCLB requirements\nand the differences in their political structures and governance\narrangements in education. Even more remarkable was the President’s\nannouncement in June 2003 that all fifty state plans were “approved,”\neven though ED was still reviewing many of them. Secretary Paige sent\neach state a letter stating that ED had approved the basic elements of\ntheir accountability plan.11 Underscoring the tentative nature of this\napproval was another letter from Under Secretary Hickok. This second\nletter, sent to all the states shortly after Secretary Paige’s letter, outlined\naspects of the plans that needed further action or were not fully\napproved.12\nIn reality, only 11 states (21.6%) had state plans that were fully\napproved by ED in June 2003 (Table 2). States that had complied with the\n1994 Improving America’s Schools Act (IASA) requirements were only\nslightly more likely than states with timeline waivers to have a completed\naccountability plan (28.6% of states with approved 1994 plan versus 20%\nof states with timeline waivers).13 None of the states that had entered into\ncompliance agreements with ED had fully approved plans. Clearly, meeting\nthe deadlines and gaining ED approval of the plans reflected a com-\npliance orientation by the states and ED rather than real progress in\nimplementing NCLB. \nTable 2.

We\nconducted this analysis using the consolidated applications from 41\nstates.15 The application included a worksheet, which summarized the status\nof ten principles required by the application. Each principle con-\ntained between one and six elements (see the appendix for a summary\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1071\nof the principles and elements). For each element, states indicated if they\nwere working to formulate a policy, had a proposed policy and were waiting\nfor state approval, or had a final state policy. For our analysis, we sum-\nmarized the status of each element that was reported by the state on their\napplication. \nA summary of the status of the required principles is presented in\nFigure 1. \nThis figure presents the average percentage of states that were working\nto formulate a policy (W), had a proposed policy (P), or had a final policy\n(F) for each principle. States were most likely to have a final policy on\nprinciple 6 (accountability system is based primarily on academic assessments).\nThis is not surprising since states were required to develop assess-\nments in three grades under the 1994 law. They were least likely to have\na final policy on principles 3 and 9, which pertain to developing a\nmethod to determine adequate yearly progress and building a reliable\nand valid accountability system. Both of these principles require a number\nof difficult psychometric decisions, such as the use of consistency\nrules, test linking, or equating one test to another as states added new\ngrades to their assessment system. \n18.7%\n12.2%\n22.0%\n17.1% 15.4%\n12.2%\n19.5%\n9.8%\n26.0%\n12.2%\n24.0%\n22.0%\n33.2%\n22.0%\n24.0%\n7.3%\n22.8%\n26.8%\n21.1%\n25.6%\n57.3%\n65.9%\n44.9%\n61.0% 60.6%\n80.5%\n57.7%\n63.4%\n52.8%\n62.2%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\nPrinciple 1 Principle 2 Principle 3 Principle 4 Principle 5 Principle 6 Principle 7 Principle 8 Principle 9 Principle 10\nA\nve\nra\nge\n p\ner\nce\nnt\nag\ne\nWorking\nProposed\nFinal\nFigure 1.

Leading states, such as\nVirginia and New York, had technical advisory panels made up of psychometricians\nthat assisted them with meeting the assessment requirements.\nHowever, since there is a limited supply of psychometricians, and many\nserve on several advisory panels, some states may have difficulty finding\nthe expertise they need. Indeed, nationwide there is a shortage of specialized\npersonnel who can devise tests, monitor their validity, and develop\nthe infrastructure needed to support extensive testing (Henriques, 2003;\nJorgensen, 2002). In short, the technical demands imposed by NCLB\nappear to exceed many states’ capacity to handle complicated psychometric\nproblems. This poses a serious risk that the tests created under the\nact may not meet the important requirements of the law mandating that\nthe tests reflect what is taught and are valid indicators of student achievement.\nIt also raises questions about whether the nation has the expertise\nnecessary to justify investing huge sums of money in test development. \nAn analysis of the separate elements that make up each principle indicates\nthat few states had a final policy for elements 1.6 (accountability sys-\ntem includes rewards and sanctions) and 5.2 (the accountability system\nholds schools and local districts accountable for the progress of student\nsubgroups) (Table 3). This is also not surprising, since the required interventions,\nparticularly providing supplemental educational services, were\nnot something states had done before. Moreover, the required interventions\nare highly unpopular with many educators, and there is no research\nbasis for what was likely to work. A report by the GAO (General\nAccounting Office, 2002) found compliance with subgroup accountability\ndifficult for states to meet under the 1994 law, so it is not surprising\nthat few states had a final policy for this element.\nState Fiscal Constraints \nWhen Congress passed NCLB, there had been significant growth in public\nschool expenditures. Federal spending for elementary and secondary\neducation had increased by 50% and by almost 20% for Title I between\n1998 and 2001. There was also the expectation, written into the law, that\nappropriations for Title I would continue to grow by significant amounts\nto offset the increased requirements placed on states. The increase in\nappropriations for Title I was viewed as a condition under which the goals\nof the legislation could be realized. Yet NCLB was implemented at a time\nwhen state governments faced the biggest decline in state revenues in at\nleast twenty years (Boyd, 2003).

For nearly every state, FY 2003 was\nthe second consecutive year of budget problems, with 39 states reporting\nbudget shortfalls at some point during the fiscal year (National\nConference of State Legislatures, 2003b). To balance their budgets, 37\nstates cut their budgets by nearly $12.6 billion in FY 2002 and another\n$14.5 billion in FY 2003 (National Governor’s Association & National\nAssociation of State Budget Officers, 2003). States used a variety of other\nmethods to help bring budgets into balance, including across-the-board\ncuts to state programs (28 states) and employee lay-offs (17 states), areas\nthat would include cuts to education. States continued to face significant\nbudget challenges for FY 2004, which the National Conference of State\nLegislatures (2003b) forecast could be even more difficult than FY 2003. \nThe federal government typically provides revenue sharing to help\nstates through economic downturns. This time that did not happen. At\nthe winter 2003 meeting of the National Governor’s Association,\nPresident Bush confirmed his intention not to provide fiscal relief for the\nstates, citing the federal budget deficit and the costs of war as constraints\non the federal budget. Instead he promised more flexibility for states on\nspending and asserted that his plan to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends\nwould boost the economy.16 This finally changed late in the 108th\nCongress as state budgets worsened and several lawmakers made a commitment\nto seek state fiscal relief. The federal Jobs and Growth Tax Relief\nReconciliation Act, signed by President Bush on May 28, 2003, provided\nstates some short-term fiscal relief. This act authorized and funded $20\nbillion spread over two years (FY 2004 and FY 2005) in fiscal relief to the\nstates, with half devoted to flexible grants to states and half to support\nMedicaid. While this aid was welcomed by states, it was temporary and relatively\nsmall. \nSince education makes up a major portion of state budgets, education\nbudgets were threatened by the state budget problems.17 A number of\nstates made cuts to their elementary and secondary education program\nto help balance the budget in FY 2003 and FY 2004. In California, a state\nwith one of the largest budget shortfalls, the governor made some acrossthe-board\nspending reductions, asked state agencies to trim 20% from\ntheir budgets, and sought wage reductions (National Conference of State\nLegislatures, 2003a). The Governor of Ohio signed an executive order in\nMarch 2003 that cut funding for the Ohio Department of Education by\n$9.3 million and state aid to schools by $90.6 million (Ohlemacher &\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1075\nOkoben, 2003). The governor, a Republican, was battling a Republicancontrolled\nlegislature’s refusal to approve a budget that included\nincreases in taxes. The budget cuts affected districts, which were forced\nto make painful decisions to lay off teachers, shorten the school year, or\nreduce class size (Gewertz & Reid, 2003). \nIn light of state budget problems, questions over NCLB funding levels\nbecame political. As part of the compromise to pass the bill, NCLB\npromised large increases in spending for Title I, and indeed, in the first\nyear (fiscal year 2002) there was an 18% increase from the prior year in\nTitle I grants to local educational agencies and a 17% increase overall for\nelementary and secondary education (Table 4). However, this level of\nincrease was not sustained in subsequent years, with the size of the\nincrease declining in subsequent years. By fiscal year 2004, appropriations\nfor Title I were increased 5.6% from the prior year and appropria-\ntions for elementary and secondary education were increased by 5.1%. In\ncontrast, the President’s 2004 proposed budget would have decreased\nappropriations for elementary and secondary education by 2.6%.18 The\nDemocrats argued that the administration’s budget proposals broke the\npromises made when NCLB was enacted to provide adequate resources\nfor reform (Miller & Kennedy, 2003, January 8). When the bill passed,\nthere was a bipartisan agreement to significantly increase financial\nresources in exchange for enacting the tough accountability provisions.\nThis agreement was reflected in the appropriation levels contained in the\nbill.19 The Republicans countered that, “the federal government is now\nspending far more money for elementary and secondary education than\nat any time in our nation’s history” (Boehner, 2003). This claim, which\nwas true in absolute amounts, was not true in terms of the federal share\nof total educational expenditures.20\nTable 4.

One Republican\nCongressional aide said it was difficult to tell how the state shortfall would\naffect implementation of NCLB, adding that “if the state budgets are\nunder pressure, certainly the federal budget is as much, if not more so,\nbecause of the defense and homeland security commitments that state\nbudgets don’t have” (Congressional aide, personal communication,\nFebruary 21, 2003). This aide believed that the funding for NCLB was\nenough to offset the costs of implementing the bill, especially if “you\nactually ask people to make better decisions with the money that they are\ngetting.” Echoing similar comments made by President Bush,21 she said: \nIt’s not just a matter of how many resources you have. It’s a matter\nof how you spend your resources. And if you are a failing\nschool or a failing school district, you don’t necessarily need a\nhuge infusion of funds. . . . It’s also a matter of deciding how to\nbetter use those funds—be it on the curriculum, be it on better\nteachers, or you know, preparing your paraprofessionals. It may\nbe not focusing on a music program and instead using your\nmusic dollars for a reading program. There are just so many decisions—minute\ndecisions that can be made at both the district\nlevel and actually at the school level. So that it’s a matter again\nnot just of level of resources but how you use the resources. \nDuring the 108th Congress, support for additional funding for NCLB\nbroke down along party lines. Democratic attempts to raise the funding\nlevels for NCLB for FY 2004 were defeated by the Republicans. In June\n2003, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced the Federal Fair\nAccountability Includes Resources Act (FedFAIR) in an effort to protect\nstates from unfunded mandates. The bill, which was defeated along partisan\nlines, would have given states the option of deferring the mandated\ncorrective actions required by NCLB in years when the promised federal\nfunding was not appropriated. \nWhen Congress enacted NCLB, there was little attention devoted to\nwhat it would cost states to implement the requirements. There was some\nattention to the costs of meeting the additional testing requirements, but\nnone in terms of meeting additional staffing requirements. As implementation\nproceeded, states began to examine how the costs of implement-\ning NCLB balanced out against the additional resources provided by the\nlaw. Several studies suggested that NCLB would cost states considerably\nmore than the funds appropriated by the federal government (Driscoll &\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1077\nFleeter, 2003; General Accounting Office, 2003b; Mathis, 2003; New\nHampshire School Administrators Association, 2002; Office of the\nLegislative Auditor, 2004;Imazeki & Reschovsky, 2004; Connecticut State\nDepartment of Education, 2005, March 2; Virginia Department of\nEducation, 2005, September 21: Palaich, Augenblick, Silverstein, &\nBrown, 2005, May). These studies began to break down the costs across\ndifferent program areas and figured in the additional administrative\ncosts of implementing the new requirements. They indicated that while\nthe added costs of assessments and data collection systems were substantial,\nthe costs of providing administrative support and remedial instruc-\ntional services to poorly performing districts and schools would be even\ngreater, especially if the number of schools and districts identified as “in\nneed of improvement” increased in future years. As this information\nbecame available, many states passed legislation exempting districts from\nspending additional money to implement NCLB. \nTo meet the NCLB requirements, state educational agencies reallocated\nstaff from other areas or added the NCLB responsibilities onto\nexisting ones. This may work when the NCLB requirements mirror current\nstate capabilities but may become more problematic as states have to\ndevelop ways to intervene in failing schools. Since states vary in their\nstaffing levels, resources and sophistication of their databases and data\ncollection capabilities, the ability of states to meet the added responsibilities\nwill depend on the local context. Nonetheless, implementing the\nNCLB requirements has severely strained the capacity of most state education\ndepartments (Sunderman & Orfield, 2006).\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nNCLB represents a major change in federal-state relationships where the\nfederal government has imposed one model of accountability across all\nstates with the expectation that states will implement its priorities.\nHowever, for NCLB to work well will require coordination and cooperation\nacross levels of government, the nurturing of a professional con-\nstituency that supports the goals of the legislation, and professional and\ntechnical expertise to interpret, administer, and manage the new programs\nand data systems. Our research found that the professional sup-\nport and expertise needed to carry out these requirements varied widely\namong the states and that there was limited effort by the federal administration\nto obtain the cooperation of the professionals who must imple-\nment the law. The lack of flexibility by federal officials on some of the\nrequirements has eroded public and political support for the law as the\nfinancial requirements of the law and the effects of sanctions negatively\n', '1078 Teachers College Record\nimpact districts and schools. Without the support of professional administrators,\nthe political visibility of the NCLB requirements has increased,\nfocusing attention on the political and financial effects of the program\nlocally rather than its contributions to improving schooling (Peterson et\nal., 1986). \nThe Bush administration recognized the political significance of educational\npolicy and moved aggressively to promote its education agenda\nwith the American public. It seemed less aware of the institutional and\norganizational impediments to dramatically changing state accountability\nsystems and educational practice and did not have a well-articulated\nimplementation strategy to address these issues. Its strategy—to adhere\nstrictly to implementation timelines and threaten to withhold Title I\nfunds to states out of compliance—carries a number of risks for both\nstates and the federal government. States may choose to go their own way\nif the requirements become too burdensome, or the federal government\nmay be forced to carry out its threats of withholding funds, thereby further\nexacerbating a state’s fiscal situation. It is also unclear what the polit-\nical fallout will be if NCLB fails or what will happen to the low-income students\nin Title I schools that do not meet the adequate yearly progress tar-\ngets. Only in the face of growing political opposition from the states did\nthe administration loosen some of the law’s requirements, and then only\nslightly.\nSince NCLB is by far the largest K-12 federal education program affecting\ndisadvantaged students, it is imperative that the federal government\nbrings state and local officials and educators into the process to work\nthrough the administrative and policy issues. When federalism works well\nthere is collaboration across levels of government and federal deference\nto state priorities, something that has not been evident so far in the\nprocess of implementing NCLB. Under the Bush administration, the federal\ngovernment has taken a leadership role and assertively advanced its\nown political and policy goals while ignoring the role of state and local\ngovernments in the policy process. It has also ignored the fact that federal\npriorities are constantly subject to legislative and appropriation deci-\nsions by a Congress that is generally far more responsive to state and local\npreferences than standards set in federal agencies. As Kaestle and Smith\nobserved in 1982, “…local control, local initiative, and local variation\nconstrain the number of educational issues the federal government can\naddress and the degree of standardization it can or should impose”\n(Kaestle & Smith, 1982).\nThe conclusion that the federal administration has failed to establish a\ncollaborative relationship with state and local officials should not be\ntaken to mean that the status quo in state and local systems was adequate,\n', 'Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act 1079\nespecially for minority students, or that there are no legitimate reasons\nfor the federal government to urgently work for more progress in\nimproving student achievement and demanding greater accountability. It\nis, rather, an observation that the reliance on regulations and aggressive\nenforcement of the law are often ineffective and sometimes counterproductive\nin working towards the goals of NCLB. That federal power is sub-\nject to state and local priorities underscores the utility of a collaborative\napproach toward implementing federal education policy. \nNotes\n1   Civil rights enforcement is the exception to the more collaborative approach to federal-state\nrelationships that has been typical in education. \n2   The vote in favor of the resolution in Virginia passed 98 to 1, with one democrat\nabstaining. In Utah, the House voted 64 to 8, with 3 abstentions, in favor of a resolution prohibiting\nstate education officials from using any local money to comply with NCLB. This res-\nolution was changed only after extensive lobbying by officials from the U.S. Department of\nEducation. \n3   The six states were selected based on the following criteria: geographic diversity, the\nproportion of minority students attending public schools, the degree of state control over\nlocal education policy (some states are highly centralized, some decentralized, and others\nare in between), and where states were in the process of adopting accountability reforms\nprior to NCLB. See (Sunderman & Kim, 2004) for more information on the selection of\nthe six states. \n4   For a detailed comparison of the 1994 IASA and the 2001 NCLB requirements, see\nTitle I Report (January 2002). Both NCLB and IASA are reauthorizations of the Elementary\nand Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n5   NCLB also included requirements that all teachers be “highly qualified.” Each state\nand district receiving Title I funds must develop a plan to “ensure that all teachers teaching\nin core academic subjects . . . are highly qualified not later than the end of the 2005-06\nschool year” (P.L. 107-110, Sec. 1119 (a)(2)). The statute defines “highly qualified” as a\nteacher who has obtained a full state certification, has a bachelor’s degree, and has demonstrated\nsubject matter competency in core academic subjects (P.L. 107-110, Sec. 9101(11)).\nThe law contains similar requirements for paraprofessionals who provide instructional support\nto students in Title I programs. \n6   The timeline mandates assessment of English language learners starting in school year\n2002-03 and administering annual statewide tests in mathematics and reading/language\narts to all students in Grades 3 through 8 by school year 2005-06.\n7   Officers signing the letter were from Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii,\nIdaho, Louisiana, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania,\nUtah, and Washington. \n8   For example, only two states vigorously objected to the federal Goals 2000 legislation.\n9   These included new rules for counting students with limited English for determining\nadequate yearly progress, relaxing some of the rules for meeting the highly qualified\nteacher requirements for rural teachers and allowing some additional flexibility for multisubject\nand science teachers, and allowing some additional flexibility for determining par-\nticipation rates for adequate yearly progress. \n', '1080 Teachers College Record\n10   State officials were required to submit a preliminary draft of the Consolidated State\nApplication Workbook by January 31, 2003, and the completed application by May 1, 2003. \n11   The initial approval letters were not posted on the ED web page. \n12   These decision letters are available from http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/\nletters/index.html?exp=0 .Retrieved 1-21-04.\n13   As of March 2003, 21 states were fully compliant with IASA requirements, 25 states\nhad been granted timeline waivers, and 5 states had entered into compliance agreements\nwith the US Department of Education. \n14   The consolidated applications were retrieved from the U.S. Department of\nEducation web site between January and March 2003. Since state consolidated applications\nare continuously updated, the ones we reviewed are no longer posted on the web site. We\nretained hard copies of the applications we used for our analysis. \n15   As of March 2003, 41 states had submitted accountability applications. \n16   It is worth noting that many of the Bush administration tax cuts resulted in lost revenue\nto states that tie their state income tax rate to the federal rate. Since states pass the\ncuts on to local governments, many were forced to raise property taxes. \n17   Spending for elementary and secondary education is estimated at 22.2% of total state\nspending and 35.4% of state spending from the general fund (National Governor’s\nAssociation & National Association of State Budget Officers, 2003). Elementary and secondary\neducation expenditures as a percent of total state expenditures range from 13.7%\nin Connecticut to 34.3% in Wyoming (National Association of State Budget Officers, 2003).\n18   The president proposed appropriating $34,796,108 for FY2004, a 2.6% decrease over\nFY 2003 appropriations for elementary and secondary education. \n19   Appropriations for Title I, Part A grants to local educational agencies were $13.5 million\nin 2002, $16.0 in 2003, $18.5 in 2004, $20.5 in 2005, $22.75 in 2006, and $25.0 in 2007\n(P.L. 107-110, Sec. 1002 (a)). \n20   The federal share of revenues for elementary and secondary education peaked at\n9.8% in 1979-80 and was around 7% in 2004.\n21   In a speech on January 8, 2003, President Bush said: “The issue is not just about\nmoney. We must spend money more wisely. We must spend money on what works. And we\nmust make sure we continue to insist upon results for the money we spend.” (Bush, 2003,\nJanuary 8).
