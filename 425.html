Reports Success\nIn Financing Project Will Build Great Seaside Resort.\nClimate, Surf, Beach, Hunting, Fishing, Etc., Make\nThis an Ideal Location.\nNews of great importance to the\nresidents of Brownsville and the\nlower Rio Grande valley is found\nin the announcement, made in to\nday\'s HERAI.D, that a national\nwinter and summer resort, like\nPalm Beach, Fla-, or Coronado\nBeach, Calif., is to be established\non the Gulf Coast, 22 miles eas,t of\nBrownsville by rail."\nThe name of this resort is Tar\npon Beach and it will be located at\nthe extreme southern end of Padre\nisland, which has for years been a\nfavorite spot for surf-bathing, boat\ning, camping, fishing, hunting and\nall out-door sports. .\nThe promoter of the enterprise,\nMr- George R. Sims, a former New\nYorker, who first visited this coun-\'\ntry last July, returned last night\nfrom Chicago and the east where\nhe went to interest capital in his\nproject.\nHis efforts were so successful\nthat capitalists in New York, Chi\ncago and San Francisco have agreed\nto underwrite 40 per cent of the\nstock in the company that will pur\nchase the land and make the im\nprovements.\nMr. Sims will personally manage\nthe enterprise. He has been engag-:\ned in the business of developing\nreal estate in New York for several\nyears and has many notable suc\ncesses to his credit.\nIt is understood that some of the\nRock Island railroad people are\nbacking him in this project and\nthat his brother, F,.\'W. ,Sims, the\nUnited States District Attorney at\nChicago who secured the $29,000,-\nQQ0 fine against the Standard Oil\nCompany, is also interested with\nhim.\nBesdies\' his interest in Tarpon\nBeach Mr. Sims has made other in\nvestments in the Brownsville dis\ntrict and he has great faith in the\nfuture of this country. To a Her\nam reporter today he said:\n"I had no difficulty in convinc\ning my friends that Padre Islanti\nhad more natural advantages as a\nwinter and summer resort than\nPalm Beach, or anyother national\nresort, but what they wanted to\nknow was where it would draw its\npatronage?\n"Then I showed them How fast\nthis valley was growing, how there\nwas np other surf bathing resort\nbetween Galveston and Tampico,\nhow it would be impossible to\nmake a resort on the mainland ow\ning to lack of transportation and\nsurf-bathing, how the fishing and\nhunting would attract sportsmen\nhere from every state in the union,\nhow the climate, surf bathing and\nboating would draw health and\npleasure seekers from Texas and all\nparts of the United States, and how\nthe lower end of the island would\nundoubtedly develop into an ocean\nshipping point when the channel is\nagain dredged and the railroad\ntrestle .is extended across the\nshallow bay to the island.\n\' \'I believe that the low transpor\ntation rates will bring thousands\nof sportsmen and tourists here from\nChicago, St. Louis and other North\nern cities just as soon as our im\nprovements are in and we are able\nto take care of the people.\n"Everybody in the state of Tex\nas would like to go to the seashore\nfor a few weeks in the summer, to\nenjoy the surf-bathing, boating,\nfishing, hunting and ocean breezes.\nWe are going to be in . shape to\ntake care of these people next sum\nmer and hope to get a large part\nof the crowd that has in the past\nbeen going to Galveston and Cor\npus Christi."\nIMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE\n"$The improvements that are to\nbe introduced at Tarjson Beach are:\nA hotel, with, a capacity for at\nleast 100 guests\'.\nA casino, or pavilion, for picnia\nparties, dancing, vaudeville, etc.\nThree landing piers, one at the\nsouthern end near the lighthouse.\nanother opposite the railroad pier\nEACH\nNTERPRISE\nat Point Isabel, and the third at\nthe northern end of the resort.\nThree board walks, extending\nfrom the landing piers directly\nacross the island to the Gulf shore.\nThree boat houses, located on the\nbayishore, , one near each landing\npier.\nThree bath houses, located on\nthe Gulf shore, one near each board\nwalk-\nThe hotel and casino will be.\nsituated in the center of the pro\nperty, equally accessible from all\nparts, and it is proposed to run\npassenger launches from Point Isa\nbel to the resort, a distance of\nless than two miles, that will make\nthe trip in less than 15 minutes at\na very low fare.\nThere is no doubt that Tarnon\nBeach will liecome a very popular\nresort with these improvements, as\nit has the most ideal climate in\nthis country and everyone who has\nlived in Brownsville very long\nknows that there is no other spot\nalong the entire Gulf coast that\ncan compare with Padre Island for\nhunting, fishing, surf-bathing,\nboating, etc. -\nThe mighty silver tarpon, king\nof game fishes, furnishes rare sport\nfor the fisherman both in winter\nand summer, and almost every\nother variety of sea fish teem in\nthe lower bay near the Pass.\nIn the fall and winter the hunt\ning is unexcelled, millions of ducks\nand wild-fowl making their home\nin the warm waters of the bay that\nseparates Padre Island from the\nmainland.\nBut it is the wonderful beach at\nPadre Island that will prove the\nchief attraction for the new resort.\nHere is a stretch of fine, white,\nhard sand, 300 feet . wide and\nalmost 90 miles long, that for\nautomobile racing excels any of\nthe Florida resorts and furnishes\nideal surf bathing, all the year\nround.\nIt was over this beaeh that Gen\neral Taylor led his troopa to\nBrownsville in the Mexican war\nwhen Fort Brown was established,\nand this was formerly the route\noverwhich the United States mail\nwas brought to Brownsville.\nPadre Island itself is 90 miles\nlong and from 1-2 to 20 miles in\nwidth. Vegetation grows rapidly\nthere owing to the supply of fresh\nwater found at a depth of 2 to. 10\nfeet. One well at the lower end\nof the island has been in constant\nuse for several years, the sand\nacting-as a filter and retainer of\nthe water. Undoubtedly palms,\noleaucfers, cedars, bamboos and pos\nsibly cocoanut trees will thrive in\nthis sandy soil nnder proper cul\ntivation. The altitude of the island is\nfrom 15 to 35 feet and there is no\ndanger from storms as it is higher\nthan Galveston, where the sea wall\nis only 16 feet high, or any of the\nFlorida Keys.\nThe storms\' that occasionally\nsweep the northern part of the\nGulf in September do not affect\nPadre island and the. highest velo\ncity attained by the wind in the\nlast 17 years was 44 miles an hour.\nFor 11 months in the year the\nclimate is perfect, with constant\ntrade winds from the southeast,\nblowing over 3,000 miles of ocean\nand making boating in the shallow\nwaters of the bay a delightful pas\ntime. Unquestionably the lower end of\nPadre island affords every facility\nfor a great winter and summer\nresort and hundreds of cottages\nwill doubtless be built there by re\nsidents of Brownsville and the\nsurrounding country-as soon as the\nimprovementsare under way.\nWith this development will come j\nbetter transportation. In fact itj\nmay mean that th? present railroad\nis to be rebuilt aud electrified\nwithin the immediate future, giv\ning Brownsville an outlet to ocean\nshipping.\nall\nOn the main line of the St. Louis,\nBrownsville Mexico Railroad,\n19 miles \'from Brownsville.\n30,000 acres of land, soil 15 feet deep\nirrigated by the silt-laden waters\ngf the Rio Grande through 14 miles,\nof main canal and 30 miles of laterals.\nwhere the Brownsville banks pay\ndepositors in full without restric\ntion and prosperity so general that\nthe word panic is unknown.

This pre\ndiction is at last about to be ful\nfilled through the efforts of the\nPadre Island Development Com\npany, which, under the direction\nof its president, Mr. Geo. RTSims,\n2ias fairly launched anenterprise\nwhich will result in thedevelop\nment of a first class seaside resort\non the lower end of Padre Island,\nSying just across Laguna Madre\nfrom Point Isabel and abutting\npon the pass of Brazos Santiago.\njHere a bounteous Providence has\nfurnished with lavish hand all the\nmaterials requisite for the estab\nlishment of one of the finest resorts\nan the whole country, the leading\nresorts of the Florida and Cali\nfornia coasts not excepted. It\nonly needs capital and enterprise\nsunder intelligent direction to make\nof Tarpon Beach all that is pre\ndicted, and that is now furnished\nwby Mr. Sims and his associates.\nHence the early fulfillment of Thb\nHkraxd\'s predictions may be con\nfidently expected. This is an event\non which the entire Brownsville\ncountry should congratulate itself,\nas the development of such a resort,\nwhich will be one of the very few\nall the year around resorts of the\nentire United States, will be the\nmeans of bringing an immense\namount of travel to this place of\nwealthy people from all over the\ncountry, and will contribute most Dr,\nmaterially to the advancement of\nBrownsville.\n"The wide scope of the enterprise\ntT the company referred to may be\nlearned from the page advertise\nment which it has in today\'s issue\nof The Herald. A perusal of this\nad will enlighten readers of The\nSerai, as to the great possibilities\nof this enterprise and post them as\n\'to what may be expected from the\ncompany which has undertaken it.\n-Iu addition to its liberal invest\nment in Herald space, the coin-\nTany is also distributing some un-\n-nsitallv handsome and attractive\nadvertising literature in the shape\nof a pamphlet printed in colors and\nillustrated with half tone cuts,\nwhich has for its frontpage a beau\ntiful illustration in colors of a fish\nerman landing a monster tarpon\nIt Is beyond doubt oae of the finest\nspecimens of advertising literature\nTthathas come under The tER\naxd\'s observations.

The water on this\nbar is from six to eight feet deep.\nThen there is the harrow bar at\nSantiago deBrazos.about 100 yards\n1 nrncc an A the water on this IS\n--- 1\n:ieht to ten feet. Some years ago,\nhe stated, an engineer, after loot\ning into the situation, gave it as\nhis opinion that Brownsville would\nhave deep water with a govern\nment appropriation of $150,000\nThis money, he stated, could be\nexpended almost wholly on a\nsystem of jetties, the current being\nsuch.as to keep the channel clear\nThe Mexican government is ex\npected to do something toward the\nwork, he stated. President Diaz\nhae Wnmo irreatlv interested in\nMatamoros, and that has been\nmade an important military point.\nIn fact, the Mexican government\ninr.Wnir into the matter of\nrebuilding or reclaiming Matamo\nros.

In fact, Brownsville\ntnA Matamoros were two of the\nlareest cities of the Southwest.\nOwing to the lack of railway\nfacilities, however, these towns\nwent backward. They are now\ncoming to the front and it,is ex\npected by those who have looked\ninto their geographical situation in\nconjunction with the deep water\nprospects that they will again ne\namong the \'leading cities of the\nSouthwest."\nBROWNSVILLE GRAIN CO.\nWholesale arid Retail Hay and Grain\nCorn, Oats, Hay, Alfalfa, Etc.\nPrompt Shipment Low Prices\nLet us furnish you with Semi\'Weekly Quotations\nFire Wood For Sale in Any Quantity\nPhone 66, Brownsville, Texas\n1\nonsense\nto say: Any kind of piano will do for practice and\nsinging."
