On the evening of August 12, 2015, a large chemical explosion occurred at Tianjin Port. We analyzed ocular injury\ncharacteristics in the survivors of this accident. Methods. Twenty injured eyes of 17 hospitalized patients were included. Initial\nbest-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), injury type, injury cause, relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), zone of injury (ZOI), and\nocular trauma score (OTS) were evaluated. Final BCVA and enucleation were the final outcome index. .e relationship between\nrisk factors and final outcomes was analyzed. Results. .e patients comprised 14 males and 3 females (mean age,\n35.24± 12.68 years). Eighteen eyes had open-globe and 2 had closed-globe injuries. Fifteen ocular injury types were reported.\nInitial visual acuity (VA) was 20/50 to 20/200, 20/200 to finger counting (FC), hand motion to light perception (HM-LP), and no\nlight perception (NLP) in 2, 7, 7, and 4 eyes, respectively. RAPDwas found in 5 eyes. Most eyes sustained severe injuries with OTSs\nof 1 (25%) and 2 (40%). Of the injured eyes, 50% had Zone III injuries. In 95% of the injured eyes, glass was the cause of injury.\n.ree of 4 eyes with an initial VA of NLP had a final VA of NLP and an outcome of enucleation. In 5 eyes with RAPD, 3 had a final\nVA of NLP and a final outcome of enucleation. Eyes with lower OTSs generally had poorer outcomes. All eyes with a final VA of\nNLP and an enucleation outcome had Zone III injuries. All 3 eyes with an enucleation outcome had retinal injuries, whereas eyes\nwith no retinal injury had a better final BCVA. Conclusions. Explosions can inflict severe ocular trauma, even indoors; 90% of\ninjured eyes had open-globe injuries caused by glass fragments. Initial NLP, RAPD, low OTS, posterior extended wound, and\nretinal injury indicate a poor final outcome.\n1. Introduction\nOn the evening of August 12, 2015, a large chemical explosion\noccurred at Tianjin Port, resulting in 165 deaths, 8\nmissing persons, 798 hospitalizations, and extensive property\nloss. As the most severe non-war-related chemical\nexplosion since the establishment of the People’s Republic of\nChina, this accident received extensive local and international\nattention.\nSeveral studies have been conducted on this explosion\naccident. Zhang et al. [1] presented the responses of\nemergency medical services and hospitals to the explosion\nand summarized the lessons that can be learned. Li et al. [2]\nalso analyzed the emergency medical response to this event\nand reported the experiences of trauma physicians to\noptimize the use of medical resources and reduce the\nmortality rate for critical patients. Guo et al. [3] analyzed\nthe treatment process for the wounded and reported the\nexperiences of the organization and management of\nemergency rescue operations. In addition, the study [3]\nrevealed that ocular trauma was the most common injury\nresulting from the accident. However, the focus of these\nstudies was on the organization and management of\nemergency medical resources. Despite being a major injury\ntype, the ocular trauma caused by this explosion has not yet\nbeen reported.\nAs the largest eye hospital in Tianjin, we received the\nmajority of eye injury victims after this accident. .e purpose\nof this study was to present and discuss the ocular\ninjuries caused by this explosion accident.We focused on the\ncharacteristics of the ocular injuries and the most severe risk\nfactors that might affect the final outcomes.\nHindawi\nJournal of Ophthalmology\nVolume 2019, Article ID 1360805, 7 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2019/1360805\n', '2. Methods\n.is was a retrospective study including 20 injured eyes in 17\nhospitalized patients treated in our hospital. Patients with\nrelatively minor corneal or conjunctive foreign bodies, adnexal\nlacerations sutured in the outpatient department, or\nsmall hyphemas were not included. .e medical injury data\nwere collected from hospital records and physician surveys\nadministered at the initial examination and additional\nsurgeries.\n.e following items were evaluated in this study: type of\ninjury, cause of injury, wound characteristics, relative afferent\npupillary defect (RAPD), visual acuity, and associated\nocular and ocular adnexal injuries. .e zone of injury (ZOI)\nand ocular trauma score (OTS) were determined at the\ninitial examination, and the data were recorded during the\nprimary surgery. .e ZOI was classified according to the\nOcular Trauma Classification Group: Zone I (wound involvement\nlimited to the cornea, including the corneoscleral\nlimbus), Zone II (wound involving the sclera and no more\nposterior than 5mm from the corneoscleral limbus), and\nZone III (wound involvement posterior to the anterior 5mm\nof the sclera) [4, 5]. .e method of calculating OTS is\nsummarized in Table 1 [6]. For eyes with hyphemas in which\nRAPD could not be observed clearly, the indirect pupillary\nlight reflex of the fellow eye was examined instead.\nFive risk factors (initial best-corrected visual acuity\n[BCVA], OTS, ZOI, RAPD, and retinal injury) and two\noutcomes (final BCVA and enucleation) were identified for\nanalysis. Terms used in the description of ocular injuries\nconformed to the recommendations of the American\nAcademy of Ophthalmology, the United States Eye Injury\nRegistry, and the International Society of Ocular Trauma [5].\n.is study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the\nTianjin Medical University Eye Hospital. Informed consent\nwas obtained from the patients and their families before any\nexamination or treatment was performed.\n3. Results\n3.1. Characteristics of the Injuries. Twenty eyes in 17 patients\nwere included in this study, with 3 patients having bilateral\neye injuries. .e patients comprised 14 men and 3 women,\nwith amean age of 35.24± 12.68 years (range, 23 to 64 years).\nAll 17 patients were indoors at the moment of the explosion.\n.e causes of the injuries were identified as being uncertain\nin one case, doorframe and glass fragments in another case,\nand glass fragments in the other 18 cases.\nTwo eyes had closed-globe injuries (corneal lamellar\nlaceration) and 18 had open-globe injuries. Fifteen types of\nocular injuries were reported. .e most common injuries\nwere open-globe injuries, vitreous hemorrhage, lid or brow\nlacerations, hyphemas, and choroidal and retinal injuries.\n.e types of ocular and ocular adnexal injuries are listed in\nFigure 1. Some eyes had multiple injury types. An openglobe\ninjury was defined as a full-thickness laceration of the\ncornea, sclera, or both [7]. Injury of the lens was defined as\ntraumatic cataracts or dislocation or absence of the lens.\nChoroidal injury included suprachoroidal hemorrhage,\nchoroidal rupture, choroidal detachment, and extrusion of\nthe choroid. Retinal injury involved detachment of or holes\nin the retina.\nTable 2 shows the characteristics and final outcomes of\nthe 20 injured eyes. Initial visual acuity was 20/50 to 20/200,\n20/200 to finger counting (FC), hand motion to light perception\n(HM-LP), and no light perception (NLP) in 2 (10%),\n7 (35%), 7 (35%), and 4 (20%) eyes, respectively. RAPD was\nnegative in 12 eyes. Indirect pupillary light reflex of the\nfellow eye was not found in 5 of the other 8 eyes, which had\nhyphemas.\n.e majority of the eyes sustained severe injuries with\nOTSs of 1 (25%) and 2 (40%). Of the remaining patients,\n20% had an OTS of 3 and 15% had an OTS of 4. None of the\npatients had an OTS of 5. In terms of the ZOI, 10 of the\ninjured eyes had Zone III injuries, 6 (30%) had Zone I\ninjuries, and 4 (20%) had Zone II injuries.\n3.2. Special Examinations and Treatment. In addition to\nroutine examination, computed tomography (CT) scans\nwere performed in each patient before surgery to confirm\neyeball rupture, intraorbital and/or intraocular foreign\nbodies, or orbital and/or optic canal fracture. Electroretinography,\nmultifocal electroretinography, and visual evoked\npotential examinations were employed to evaluate the\ncondition of the retina and optic nerve, as required. B-scan\nultrasonography or color Doppler ultrasonography was\nperformed to assess the condition of the vitreous body,\nchoroid, and retina at appropriate times. Ultrasound biomicroscopy\nwas used to determine the anterior segment\ncondition of the eye, as required.

In the eyes that underwent surgery, 2 eyes underwent\n4 surgeries, 3 eyes underwent 3 surgeries, 5 eyes underwent 2\nsurgeries, and 6 eyes underwent 1 surgery. In the patients\nwho underwent 2 surgeries, the second surgery comprised\nvitrectomy and silicone oil injection. .e third surgery was\nenucleation for 3 eyes and silicone oil injection for 2 eyes.\n.e fourth surgery was a simple silicone oil injection and\nepiretinal membrane peeling with a secondary silicone oil\ninjection for 2 eyes. In addition, 2 eyes received retinal laser\nphotocoagulation after repair of the globe.\n3.3. FinalOutcomes. Final visual acuity was ≤20/40, 20/50 to\n20/200, 19/200 to FC, HM to LP, and NLP in 8 (40%), 5\n(25%), 3 (15%), 1 (5%), and 3 (15%) eyes, respectively. .ree\nof the 20 eyes had a final outcome of enucleation.\n3.4. Relationship between Risk Factors and Final Outcomes.\nIn the 4 eyes with a primary visual acuity of NLP, only 1\ninjured eye had a final outcome of light perception (LP); the\nfinal visual acuity of the other 3 eyes was NLP with an\noutcome of enucleation. In 5 eyes with a positive RAPD, 4 of\nwhich had an initial visual acuity of NLP and the other had\nan initial visual acuity of LP, whereas 3 had a final visual\nacuity of NLP and the other 2 had final visual acuities of LP\nand HM. .ree of these 5 eyes had a final outcome of\nenucleation.\nAll of the eyes with a final visual acuity of NLP and LP\nhad an OTS of 1. In addition, all 3 eyes with a final outcome\nof enucleation also had an OTS of 1. Eight eyes with an OTS\nof 2 had a final visual acuity, ranging from FC to 20/20. Four\neyes with an OTS of 3 had a better final visual acuity, ranging\nfrom 20/100 to 20/20. .e other 3 eyes with an OTS of 4 had\nfinal visual acuities of 20/30, 20/20, and 20/20. In general, the\neyes with a lower OTS had a poorer outcome. All of the eyes\nwith a final visual acuity of NLP and an enucleation outcome\nhad Zone III injuries.\nNine eyes with no retinal injury had a favorable final\nBCVA, ranging from 20/100 to 20/20. In another case (no.\n19) with a minor retinal hole, the final BCVA was 20/20. In\nthe other 10 eyes, with retinal injuries, the final BCVA\nranged from NLP to 20/50. All 3 eyes with an enucleation\noutcome had retinal injuries.\nAnother remarkable result was that all 3 eyes with an\nenucleation outcome had an initial visual acuity of NLP, a\npositive RAPD syndrome, and Zone III injuries. In addition,\nall 3 eyes with retinal injuries had an OTS of 1.\n4.

[7], they found that 10% of all surgical admissions\nsuffered severe ocular or ocular adnexal injuries.\nHowever, in this study, 17 of 798 hospitalizations had severe\nocular or ocular adnexal injuries; the rate was 2.13% and was\nsmall compared with other studies. .e reason may be that\nthe explosion happened at midnight when most people were\nindoors in sleep. Another reason was that patients with\nrelatively minor ocular injuries were not included in this\nstudy. In the study of Mader et al. [7], there were 44 bilateral\nocular injuries for a total of 251 severe injuries; the rate of\nbilateral involvement was 17.53%. In our study, 17.64% had\nbilateral involvement, which was close to that in the Mader\net al.\n.e mechanism of blast injuries has traditionally been\ndivided into 4 categories: primary, secondary, tertiary, and\nquaternary. A primary blast injury is the direct result of the\nblast wave itself; air-filled structures, such as the lungs,\neardrums, and gastrointestinal system, are most susceptible\nto primary blast injuries. Secondary blast injuries are\ncaused by flying debris or fragments propelled by the\nexplosion. Often exposed and unprotected, the eyes are\nparticularly susceptible to secondary blast injuries. A tertiary\ninjury is caused by displacement of the whole body or\npart of the body by the blast or structural collapse and\nfragmentation of a building. Quaternary blast injuries refer\nto other explosion-related injuries, including chemical or\nthermal burns, toxic inhalation, radiation exposure, and\nasphyxiation [8, 13, 14].\nWe spared no effort in repairing the structure and recovering\nthe visual potential of every injured eye, even if it\nseemed to have minimal visual potential. Only functionally\ndestroyed eyes with no possibility of visual or cosmetic\nsalvage were removed. However, 35% of the injured eyes had\na final BCVA lower than 20/200, and 15% of the injured eyes\nhad a final outcome of enucleation. .is eye excision rate\nwas close to that reported in previous studies [7, 15]. Morley\net al. [14] indicated that both severe penetrating and nonpenetrating\nblast-related eye injuries may be associated with\na poor visual prognosis because of severe anterior and\nposterior segment damage.\nIn this study, the cause of almost all of the injuries was a\nsingle glass fragment, except in one case in which the cause\nwas uncertain and another case in which the cause was\ndoorframe and glass fragments. Epidemiological studies on\nexplosions in modern buildings frequently cite glass as a\nmajor source of lacerations and foreign bodies affecting the\neye [13]. Mines et al. [8] found that most injuries among the\nsurvivors of bombings result from secondary effects of the\nblast, in the form of flying and falling glass, building materials,\nand other debris. In a study conducted by.ach et al.\n[16], glass fragments caused by a blast were the mechanism\nof all the ocular injuries in the survivors. Our results are\nconsistent with those of these previous studies.\nIn early hospital treatment, obtaining an objective\nmeasure of best visual acuity is critical as a “vital sign” of the\neye. Initial BCVA appears to be the single most crucial factor\nin predicting final visual acuity in patients with penetrating\ninjuries, with NLP being an indicator of poor prognosis [14].\nPage et al. [17] found that preoperative BCVA was positively\nassociated with final BCVA and enucleation. In the present\nstudy, 3 of 4 injured eyes (75%) with a primary visual acuity\nof NLP had a final outcome of NLP with an outcome of\nenucleation, and only 1 injured eye (15%) had a final outcome\nof LP. .is finding constitutes further evidence that\ninitial visual acuity of NLP is an indicator of poor prognosis.\nAn irregular pupillary responsemay indicate intracranial\npathology [13]. .e evaluation of RAPD in the injured eye is\na crucial functional test and parameter for quantifying the\nloss of neuronal function in asymmetric optic nerve disease\nand correlates closely with estimated retinal ganglion cell\nloss in optic nerve disease [18]. As previous studies have\nreported, the presence of RAPD is critical in terms of\npredicting outcome and has been shown to be an independent\nprognostic factor of poor final visual acuity\n[19–22]. In this study, the presence of RAPDwas found to be\nassociated with a poor outcome. .ree of 5 eyes (60%) with\nRAPD had a final visual acuity of NLP and a final outcome of\nenucleation..e other 40% (2 of 5 eyes) without RAPD had a\nfinal visual acuity of LP and HM. However, the tendency to\nneglect the importance of RAPD during the initial examination\nof injured eyes is concerning. Performing RAPD\nexamination may be time-consuming but is critical as a\nroutine practice.\n.e OTS was developed by Scott to predict visual outcome\non the basis of an initial examination [6]. OTSs range\nfrom 1, indicating the most severely injured eyes, to 5, indicating\nthe least injured eyes..eOTS has been widely used\nFigure 3: Slit-lamp photograph of a patient 1 week after repair of\nthe globe.\nFigure 4: Color Doppler ultrasonography of a patient exhibiting\nvitreous fibroplasias (indicated by hollow arrows) and choroidal\nand retinal detachment (indicated by solid arrows) 3 days after\nrepair of the globe.\nJournal of Ophthalmology 5\n', 'for the evaluation of eye injuries and has been proven to be a\nreliable indicator for predicting the visual outcome of\nvarious ocular traumas [23–25]. In general, eyes with a lower\nOTS had a poorer outcome in this study, which is in\nagreement with previous studies [17, 21, 26].\n.e ZOI is another factor likely to affect the outcome of\nopen-globe injuries. In this study, all of the eyes with a final\nvisual acuity of NLP with an enucleation outcome had Zone\nIII injuries..is result is consistent with those from previous\nstudies [22, 27] in which the results revealed that the more\nposteriorly the wound extends, the greater the probability of\npoor visual outcome is.\n.e relationship between the final outcome and injury\ncombined with choroidal and retinal injury was investigated.\nRetinal detachment was found to be a crucial\nprognostic factor in previous studies [21, 28, 29]. When\nretinal detachment occurs, photoreceptor cells are likely\nto be severely injured, which may lead to a poor final visual\nacuity [27]. In the present study, all of the eyes with no\nretinal injury had a more favorable final BCVA, ranging\nfrom 20/100 to 20/20, whereas in the eyes with retinal\ninjuries, 90.0% (10 of 11) had a final BCVA, ranging from\nNLP to 20/50. .e only exception was an injured eye with\na minor retinal hole and a final BCVA of 20/20. In addition,\nall 3 eyes with an enucleation outcome had retinal\ninjuries.\n.e time between the injury and primary surgery has\nalso been reported to be crucial in determining prognosis,\nand patients who experience more prolonged treatment\ndelays have been determined to have a higher rate of\ncomplications and subsequent enucleations [14, 17, 30].\nBecause all of the injured eyes underwent surgery within 24 h\nto repair the globe and the data were limited to a narrow\nrange, we did not include treatment delay as a prognostic\nfactor in this study.\n.is study had several limitations. As an eye hospital, we\ndid not receive any ocular trauma patients who had severe\ninjuries of other parts of the body and/or systemic diseases;\ntherefore, the study may have failed to include patients\nadmitted to other general hospitals. Another limitation was\nthat statistical analysis was not performed because of the\nsmall sample size. Despite this limitation, the results showed\nthe relationship between numerous risk factors and the final\noutcomes of eye trauma.\nIn summary, as the foremost ophthalmology hospital in\nthe Tianjin region, we received the majority of survivors of\nthe 8.12 Tianjin Port explosion accident who sustained\nocular injuries. Of the injured eyes, 90% had open-globe\ninjuries caused by glass fragments. Although we tried our\nbest to treat and save the injured eyes, 15% had a final BCVA\nof NLP with an enucleation outcome. An initial visual acuity\nof NLP, presence of RAPD, a low OTS, a posteriorly\nextending wound, and retinal injury might indicate a poor\nfinal outcome.\nData Availability\n.e data used to support the findings of this study are\navailable from the corresponding author upon request.\nDisclosure\nHao Jiang and Chao Xue are co-first authors.\nConflicts of Interest\n.e authors report no conflicts of interest.\nAuthors’ Contributions\nHao Jiang and Chao Xue contributed equally to this work.\nReferences\n[1] J.-J.
