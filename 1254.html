        <pre>['7\' vi 1 A\n\' i i ..,rt ;.nt .w iat .V)\nBOONE, WATAUGA COUNTY, THURSDAY, JULY 30 1914.\nNO. 1\nVOL. XXI\nt fit ::" ri\nCrasidt Against BIMiiss\nMr. John E. Ray, of Raleigh\nprincipal oi the state school for\nthe blind at Raleigh, has ad\ndressed to the people of Norte\nCarolina a message that all\nshould read carefully. He shows\nthat blindness is very often pre\nventable and he tells how to pre\nvent it. He says:\nOne of the most distressing mis\nfortunes which can befall a person\nis to loose one\'s sight . The larger\nnumber of this class of out citi\nznes is very great-ono hundred\nthousand in America alone.\nThere are nearly two thousand\nin North Carolina.\nThe question naturally arises\nis there any means to prevent\nthis? Can anything be done to\nlessen the number of those thus\nafflicted? Not many can be fully\nand entirely relieved or cured.\nty skillful operations a few can\nsecure at least partial reliel, but\nthe vast majority are doomed to\na life of physical darkness. What\nthen, can be done to lessen the\nevil?\nPREVENTION\nIt is much more easy to pre\nvent an evil than to cure, or erad\nicateit. Who can stay the rava\ngesof the "White Plague;" who\nstop the progress of typhoid ma\nlaria or yellow fever? The only\nhnn is in Dreventine them. So\nwith blindness. Well, how.\nLet us consider some of the\nmost prolific causes of blindness.\nThe statistics gathered by the\nauthorities of the State Sclioo\nfor the Blind at Raleigh show\nthat of the 494 students enrolled\nduring the biennial period 1910\n1912, thirty became blind by ac\ncident; seventy-five were born\nblind (congenital); ninety-three\nare blind from ophthalmia neon\natorum (blindness ol the new\nborn), and ninety-nine from caus\nes not named. The question oc\ncurs: Are any of these prevent\nable? Yes, many of them. If pa\nrents had kept from their babies\nsharp-pointed instruments or objects-scissors,\nknives, pencils,\nsticks, etc.-andexplosives, many\nof their children would now pos\nsess sight. If fewer cousins had\nmarried, if fewer congentially\nblind persons, the number would\nhave been decreased considerably.\nAnd if the eyes of every new-born\nbaby had received proper atten\ntion within twenty -four hours af\nter its birth; if they had been\nthoroughly washed in a solution\nof boracic acid, and then one drop\nof a one-per-cent solution of sil\nver nitrate had been put in each\neve. at least one-fourth of all\nthese children would now have\nnormal eight.\nThese latter are the offspring\nof parents at least one of whom\nhas led an impure life, or has\ncome in contact with some one\nwho has. In thisday, then, of\ngerm theories, and germ trans\nmission, would it not be wise that\nthe eyes of every child, however\npure and clean may have been\nthe habits of its parents, should\nreceive such care and treatment?\nProperly treated there can be no\ndanger; neglected, no one knows\nwhat may result.\nAnd the the treatment will cost\nnot more than ten cents and re\nquire only a few moments of time.\nIs it not worth the time.\' nd\nyet I wish to throw out one warn\ning, raise one danger signal.\nNever should a stronger solution\nof silver nitrate be used than one\nper cent And never should a\nmidwife, nurse, nor even a gener\nal practitioner undertake to pre\npare the prophylactic. This has\nbeen done by the experts in the\nprofession and can be secured\nfrom any well equipped drug store\nin such quantity and shape as to\nrender a mistake almost impos\nsible. The little ampules contain\nBack ti the Bile.\nCertain of our wise men of to\nday have shaded away sin till it\nit becomes an expression of tem\nperament. They tell us that we\nsin because our granafathers sin\nned, and because our home issit\nuated in the wrong block. These\nare clever words" of clever com\nforters, and surely they ought to\nwipe away forever the tears from\nour eyes, But they donotspeak\nto human need. They leave life\nblighted and the heart ashamed\nThey leave the sinning one to\ncontinue in despair. He doesnot\nask that his sin shall be explain\ned away. He wjshes forgiveness\nand a new start. In the Book\nwhich is not read as once it was,\nthere are no soft words about\nsin. But the way out is shown.\nAnd not onlv is forgiveness offer\ned in this Book, but man\'s need\nof comfort is met. There is com\nfort in plenty. These writers\nknew the human heart. They saw\nhim broken by his toil and his\ngrief. And for this, too, they had\nthe answer. They told of a Being\nof love, hidden just back of this\nrude and temporary universe.\nThis love, they said, is conscious\nof how the littlest child and the\nold man are sick at heart for one\nto come close to their loneliness.\nWhen again will any company of\nwriters say the things they know\nin such tellinir words, such pk\ntares of hurablp life the boy far\nawav from the faces of his home\nand far gone in shame such true\nstories of towly devotion break\ning through into, beauty? Much\nis swept away Between us arid\nthem, but not one accent of Na\nomi\'s voice is lost to us, arid still\nthe "Turn again my daughters,"\nis as wistful as when it breathed\nthrough the alien corn; What\nricher consolation are we hungry\nfar that we turn from Judea?\nHas the human heart changed\nunder the wear of the centurise,\nso that sin no longer seeks for\ngiveness, and grief has no need of\na comforter? Have our ships sail\ned so far that they have revealed\nto us a braver continent than the\nfields where pain once reigned?\nIs our science so acute that it has\nbanished iailure from man\'s life?\nIs man\'s heart at least self-suffi\ncient and all-sufficing?\n"The heavens shall vanish a\nwav like smoke, and the earth\nshall wax old likeagarment, and\nthey that dwell therein shall die\nin like manner. But my salva\ntion shall be forever, and my\nrighteousness shall not be abol\nished. (Isa. 516. )-Colliers Week\nly\nBi Bisinss Boon\nA dispatch from Altoona, Pa.,\nof July 29th, says: With every\ndepartment of the Altoqna shops,\nthe industrial center olthe Penn\nsylvania Railroad Company\nworking lull time and many de.\npartraents working overtime;\nthis city is enjoying an unsur\npassed era of prosperity.\nWithin the last few days addi\ntional orders for engines and can\nhave been placed with the shopf\nhere, and enough work is nowoi\nhand to keep all department\nworking for at least a year.\nAn order for 81 freight engines,\nthe largest ever used by the Penn\nsylvania, has been placed with\nthe Junita shops, while an order\nhas just been placed with the car\nshops for 1,000 all steel box cars,\nthe most costly equipment of its\nkind ever ordered by the Rail\nroad. .\nSome months ago there was a\nslight suspension in the Altoona\nshops and about 1,200 men were\nlaid off; Within the last 10 days\npractically all of these men have\nreturned to work, while addition\nal mechaniss have been employ\ned from other cities.\nThe D.

The present spring\nplant, the largest iu the world, is\ninadequate to supply the springs\nneeded. Th new plant will cost\nabout $80,000, and work on it\nwill be started within the next\nmonth.\nSo great has become the work\nin all the departments here that\nthe officials have asked the men\nto forego their usual shop picnics,\nis the officers of the company in\nPhiladelphia have asked that the\nvork just ordered be turned out\nis rapidly as possible.\nModern machines that will in-\n:rease the output of engines and\ncars are being installed in the\nJunita car shops, and these will\nrequire the employment of addi\ntional men.\nThe engineers of the test depart\nment of the Pennsylvania Rail\nroad for the last two weeks have\nbeen testing out a huge passen\nger locomotive built in the Jun\nita shops as a model. So far,\nthe tests have proved the effici\nency of the engine, and a high\nPennsylvania official stated to\nnight that it was likely that an\norder of at least 50 of these en\ngines would be placed with the\nJunita shops during the next\nmonth.\nThere is the greatest activity\nin all business circles in Altoona,\ndue to the era of prosperity in\nthe shops, and leading business\nmen declare that their record of\nbusiness for 1914 will be ahead\nof anything done in years.\nPROFESSIONAL\nfOLEYSHDBEYPfflLS\nFa Backache KiowmwoBuooa\nThe total , pension payment\nsince the ciuil war, now verges\nclosely on five billion dollars.\nThe 7th case of, the Bubonic\nplague has been discovered in\nNew Orleans.\nThe city of Greensboro has\nvoted $100,000 bonds for the\nimprovement of her streets.\nRev.

C. Mast, the candidate\nfor the legislature, is one of our\nchoice citizens and well qualified\n4a every respect to fill with hon\nor the position whieh-he seeks.\nThe nomination was, in a sense,\nthrust upon him, but, noble fel\nlow that he is, gallantly accent\ned the notntilation, and a more\nwjrthy citizen never asked for\nthe suffrage of our people than\nhe. He is a farmer, and a pros\nperous one tqo and has the inter\nest of the tireless tillers of\nthe soil at heart. He has a good\npractical education; is a good\nthinker, is a splendid talker, and\nif elected would make an ideal\nmember.\nW. P. Moody, the candidate\nfor sheriff, is a hustler at what\never he undertakes, and in a ma\njority of case9, he is successful,\nalthough he was defeated for\nsheriff two years ago by a very\nsmall majority. He has all the\ncharacteristics that go to make\nup an ideal sheriff, and with his\nclean charcter and marked abili\nty for the position, all raei of all\nparties can well afford to voe\nfor him.\nFor treasurer, John Ward, and\nthe name of a better man dot e\nn )t appear upon the ticket. He\nhas succeeded well in business, is\na good christian gentleman and\nwill joe hard to defeat, in fact,\nMr. Ward hardly knows what\nthe word fail means, and can be\ndepended upon to raaka a quiet\nand telling campaign.\nMr. M. P. Critcher, the candi\ndate for Clerk of the court, ia a\nsynonym of all thatgoestomake\nup a citizen in the true sense of\nthe word, and is, in every way,\nwell qualified for the responnible\npssition. He is a man of unspot\nted character, of pleasant de\nmeanor, and would, if elected, fill\nthe position with dignity, ability\na id marked courtesy to all.\nGranville Norris, thecandidatf\nfor Register of Deeds, is web\nequipped for the position. He is.\nas our people know, a right ba\ncripple, but is a live wire when it\ncomes to business. The position\nwould suit him admirably.\nTo our mind the office of coun\nty commissioner is the most im\nportant and means more to the\npeople than any other, and the\nconvention certainly had this\nidea in view when they nomina\nted Messrs. W. C. Coflev. N. L\nMast and Richard Wagner as\ncandidates. There hasneA-er beei\nbetter financeerain the county\ntoan Meesrs-. Coffev and Mast\nwith Richard Wagner as a close\nsejond.
