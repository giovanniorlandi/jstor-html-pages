The Chicago Tribune admits that it has read with\n"no little interest" this suggestion from one of its city pastors,\nespecially as it is based upon the above principle that, it says,\nPresident Wilson has made clear in the reply he sent to the pope\'s\npeace appeal :\nIn entire sincerity and with only the purest motives, the Ameri\ncan churches of America can pray that the truth about this war may\nbe made manifest to the German people, that Germans may be given\nthe courage and wisdom to secure emancipation, and that a free Ger\nmany, peaceful because free, may take its deserved place in a free and\ncomparatively peaceful world. We suggest, therefore, that the churches\nof America appoint a day of prayer for the people of Germany.\nShould this be done there would perhaps be disgust and suspicion\non the Germans\' part, and disgust and suspicion might last for several\nday or weeks. Eventually, however, it would dawn upon the Ger\nmans that what President Wilson said was so. Nor do we mean to\nargue that prayer is a mere subjective exercise when we predict that\nthe news of the American day of prayer for the German people would\nlead numerous Germans to question the cleverness of longer starving\nand bleeding to postpone freedom.\nKNICKERBOCKER PREROGATIVE\nLittle Sydney had reached the mature age of U and was about\nto discard petticoats for the more manly raiment of knickerbockers.\nThe mother had determined to make- tlae occasion a memorable one.\nThe breakfast-table was laden with good things when the newly\nbreeched infant was led into the room.\n"Ah!" exclaimed the proud mother, "now you are a little\nman !\nSydney was in ecstaeies.

Our forefathers carried\nor hauled home their purchases. We, under the spur of neces\nsity, can and should do likewise.\nThere are two angles to the proposed reform that should appeal\nto the public. First, the direct savings to the purchaser. Tlii\nin the aggregate, is bound to be enormous, as the expense of deliv\nery throughout the country has grown to huge proportions. Sec\nond, the releasing for other and more needed service the immense\ncapital and equipment now tied up in the special delivery of mer\nchandise. Thousands upon thousands of horses, wagons, autos.\ntrucks to say nothing of the men and boys are now engaged in\nthis work, which is to a large extent entirely superHous. There is\na vital need in other channels for all of this force, and it should be\nreleased and made available where it is so badly needed.\n.Among the economic reforms none is more important.

Unmistakable evi-\nlences appearing that a dog afflicted\nwith rabies was at large in Ormsby\ncounty and in the City of Carson for a\nnumber of days within the present\nweek, and that the said dog came in\ncontact with and probably inoculated\nother animals with the virus of this\ndread disease; and\nWHEREAS, Experience of other\ncommunities in this state indicates that\nthe protection of the public health de\nmands the most rigid action in such\ncases : now.\n\'11 1 KR Kb ORE.

Statutes of Nevada,\n19 1 it, do hereby proclaim all of the ter\nritory within Ormsby county, Nevada,\nincluding the City of Carson, to be im\nd.r quarantine with respect to rabies.\n(.ountv and city authorities are here\nby urgently requested to promulgate by\nrigid orders regulations requiring im\nmediate imprisonment or impounding\nof all dogs ami cats (the most common\ncarriers of the disease) within the\ncounty and city upon the premises of\nthe owners thereof. Such imprison\nment or impounding to be eflected in a\nmanner that will prevent contact with\nthe said animals by human beings or bv\nother animals and to require the peace\nofficers to promptly destroy any such\nanimal found running at large within\nthe said county or the said citv.\nPROYIDF.D. HOWEVER." That\nowners of dogs may take them upon\npublic highways or public streets on\nleash carried by said owners and not\notherwise.\nThe importation or bringing or trans\nporting of dogs out of any portion of\nOrmsby county or of the City of Car\nson is hereby prohibited.\nGiven under my hand and the Great\nSeal of Nevada at the Capitol in Car\nson City, this 15th day of September,\nin the vear of our Lord 1917.\nK\'MMF.T D. BOYLK, Governor.\n0 FORCE BROD1GAN, Sec\'y of State.\nThe proclamation of the governor\nwas at once followed by a resolution\nliy the Hoard ot County\nSATtfiMJHF H\n(Continued from Page One\nand which appears in another column.\nto impound all dogs or cats running at\nlarge, not under leash or muzzled, and\ndispose of them in two days if not re\ndeemed. Every precaution is being taken by\nthe authorities to guard against the\nspread of this dread disease in the\ncommunity and the public at large and\nowners of all dos are co-operating\ngenerally.\nSheriff Stern has since Saturday\ndispatched five canines, and several\ndogs known to have been bitten have\nbeen killed by the owners.\nThe sheriff desires to call attention\nto the fact that a safe and sane observ\nance of all the requirements in this\nmatter will be of much more efficient\nhelp in properly controling the condi\ntion than a hysterical cry and general\ndesire to slaughter every dog that is\nheard barking, it being the experience\nin other cases where a quarantine has\nbeen established that a great many peo\nple go more mad than do the dogs and\nconsequently a great hue and cry is\nraised against dogs in general.\nThat all due precaution will be taken\nby the authorities is evidenced by the\nfollowing statement from Governor\nBoyle:\nWhile the order may be unpopular\nwith many who are the owners of val\nuable pets, which they are certain have\nnot come in contact with rabid animals,\nthe step is taken to prevent a repetition\nof occurences experienced in other sec\ntions of the state where the matter was\ntreated lightly until many human be\nings had been bitten. Then drastic ac\ntion was taken to check the disease by\nthe close observance of a similar quar\nantine. It is better that every dog and\ncat in the county be killed than run the\nrisk of one child being bitten, ami 1\nhope that the people of this county will\nexert every effort to see that the situa\ntion is taken in hand at once.\nimmissioners.\n" imo foeMer oil "\nWHITE J.

It was shown that the as\nsessment of lands in the state as the\name appears on the tax rolls would\nimotint to a total of r,lSJ,4(AS. Ap\nplying the proposed plan ot assessment\nis outlined by the board, the total of\nissessment of lands would be $20,727,\n8, or an increase of $1,544,830. How\never, in the proposed plan ot assess\nment Churchill and Washoe counties\nwere not considered and special treat\nment will be necessary in those two\ncounties: in Churchill on account of\nthe government equity, which is taken\nout of the land, and in Washoe county\nby reason of a misclassiheation of lands\nbv the assessor.\nHowever, the net percentage increase\nof 8.05 per cent resulting from the ap\nplication of the proposed plan to all\nother lands in the state was applied to\nWashoe county after the very\nstrenuous objections of the asses\nsor from Washoe and this afternoon\nthe discussion of the application of said\nplan itf assessment for lands will be\ntaken up with regard to Churchill\ncounty.\nOn Saturday afternoon the report of\nthe banking committee of the Board of\nPenalization was discussed and adopt\ned, showing an increase in the assess\nment of banks for the year 1917 of $43,\n000 over 1916. Thereafter, on motion of\nMr. Reinhart, member of the Tax com\nmission and chairman of the banking\ncommittee of the Board of Equaliza\ntion, the action on the adoption of the\nreport was rescinded and the bank as\nsessment allowed to stand the same for\nhe year 1917 as placed on the rolls\nby the assessors.\nRESOLUTION\nWHEREAS. The governor of the\nstate of Nevada has issued a proclama\ntion declaring a quarantine on all dogs\nand cats within the boundaries of\nOrmsby county, Nevada, therefore; be\nit\nRESOLVED, That all dogs and\ncats found upon any of the roads or\nhighways within the boundaries of\n)rmshy county, Nevada, be impounded\nbv the sheriff or any peace officer of\nthis county unless said dogs or cats be\nheld under leash carried by the owner\nof said animal, and that said animal\nbe properly muzzled.\n11ns resolution is to take eiiect im\nmediately upon, and be in force from\nand after its passage, and the county\nclerk is instructed to publish this reso\nlution in the Carson City News and\nCarson Daily Appeal to notify all own\ners of impounded animals that unless\ncalled for within two days they will be\ndisposed of.\ndisposed of.

Reno Commercial college.\nspeaking the murderer placed the point\nof his gun at Brow\'s side and broke\naway. In view of the erratic record of\nthe \'men for the night, it is believed by\nthe police that the gun was empty, oth\nerwise Brow would have been number\ned among those killed or injured. The\nsecond holdup man made his escape up\nVirginia street, disappearing in the\ndarkness near the university.\nAroused by the pistol reports, neigh\nlwirs summoned the police and rushed\ninto the streets. They found Pilipcnko\nlaying in a pool of blood, face down\nward. They turned him over, and al\nthough be groaned he did not regain\nconsciousness. He was taken to the\nemergency hospital, where he died at\n9:15 o\'clock.\nThe capture of lack Bradley, who\nwas connected with two of the robber\nies and who is suspected of being the\nman who killed Pilipcnko, the student,\nis due to C. A.

Forsyth at first mistook the iron\nweapon for a gun. but .when the man\ndrew it back to strike, Forsyth, a tall,\nwiry fellow, landed on the bandit\'s jaw\na right arm punch that knocked him\nunconscious for ten minutes.\nForsyth notified the night watchman\nat the Nevada l acking company and\nthe police were called. Durintr the in\nterval between the knockout punch and\ne arrival of the police, a second man\nslunk in the shadows of the buildings.\nand otherwise acted suspiciously, lie\nis believed to be the comnanion of\nBradley.\nBlood was found on Bradley\'s hands\nat the police station, and a steel\nhandled knife, first described and then\nidentified by Pappas as his property,\nwere found on bis person.
