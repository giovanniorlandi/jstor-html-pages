Nothing has been added to the, Fund since it was creatèd many years, ago. It represents, in a sense, our, belief in the future of St. Annels, Parish and our intention that it shall, be carried on after we who are now, responsible for it, have gone. We are, sure that when members of this parish, realize this, they will consider the, future of the Church they love, and, make provision for its maintainence, in, their wills. , And we further the sug, gestion—that a certain Sunday in the, year shou\'d be set aside for an offering, »for this purpose.

But, at this critical period of world unrest, and war shock they are much more th, be feared, for several reasons., 1. The presence in our country of a, 0 large body of foreigners—said to number, 15,000,000 — totally ignorant of our, language, customs and government., 2. The ominous fact that the man, nearest the President and whom be, constantly consults, and who is believed, to inspire his leading policies, an, obscure politician from Texas named, "Col." House, is the author of a book, filled with these dangerous anarchistic, doctrines held by the Bolsheviki and, the I. W. W \'s., 3. The fact that the President a year, ago in his address to Congress expressed, a sympathy for and belief in the Bol, sheviki whose wild deeds of murder and, rapine under the leadership of Lenine, and Trotzky, two hireling emissaries, of Germany have brought chaos in, Russia. The President acclaimed Bol, shevism as the "voice of the Russian, people" and the latest and best ex, pression of democracy,, suggested that this Bolsheviki mob be, formally recognized as the responsible, government in Russia !, Our own brand of Bolshevism—a, foreign-bred ulcer—the "Independent, Workers of the World," or I.

Now that hostilities, have ceased we must "assume the add, ed burden of keeping starvation from, increasing Its toll upon the millions, who have been liberated from the, Prussian yoke. Famine would undo, the work which has been accomplished, in freeing the world for democracy. No, stable government can be established, and maintained by a nation harassed, by hunger. A starving people -turns, to rioting and anarchy. Food has, given strength gnd courage to the no, tions fighting for democracy ; it must, now give the nations strength and, tranquillity to re-establish themselves, in freedom and democracy., Without our help it would have been, absolutely Impossible for the Allies to, maintain a living ration. Since our, entry into the war we have been con, tributing largely to the support of one, hundred and twenty million people, whose normal food supplies have been, cut off, whose production has fallen, almost to the vanishing point, whose, fields have been devastated by Ger, many. The food exported from the, United States in the past year has, been sufficient to supply the complete, ration of twenty-two million people. -, It is hard to grasp the magnitude, and significance of the assistance, which has been lent the Allies by tbe, patriotic, voluntary service of tbe, American people. The food we sent, abroad last year would have been suf, ficient to feed one-fifth of our popula, tion. And this was done In spite of, the fact that we entered the year with, short crops. Our surplus was practi, cally nothing. An overwhelming pro, portion of the food that left this coun, try last year was saved out of the nor, mal home consumption of our own, people., In spite of difficulties met in inter, nal transportation and shortage of, ocean tonnage our food exports last, year amounted to a figure that a few, years ago would have been unbelieva, ble. Even the most optimistic element, of our population faced with anxious, consternation the prospect which, opened before us with the beginning, of the 1917 harvest year., The American people have not been, compelled to save.

I, tinue to Conserve .Labor and to Meet, Other Problems of His Operation, Brought About by the War., Though the armistice has been sign, ed, the eyes of the world are still fo, cused upon the American farmer, who., is called upon to exert his-best effort, to produce greater yields of all farm, commodities under the existing short, supply of labor. The duty is" pressing,, of furnishing abundant supplies for;, our own people, and in a large meas-i, ure for shipment abroad. Conditions, generally make it important that the 1, farmer retain on the farm over winter, as much of his labor supply as possi, ble. This man power should likewise:, be utilized to accomplish tasks which;, might otherwise fall in the busier sea, sons of spring and summer, (ft at, planting and harvest times. One of, these tasks which is of a rather la-, horions nature is that of liming, and, fortunately it may be done in winter,, though It is not the customary prac, tice. Yet, under the circumstances, it, Is one way to utilize labor efficiently, during the winter and at the same, time bring about better soil conditions, aod greater yields so badly needed., Liming Soils in Winter an Advisable, Practice, According to Opinions of, Agricultural Colleges., Agriculturalists and Experiment Sta, tion workers have been prompted by, difficulties arising out of war condi, tions to give thorough consideration to, the practice of liming soils in winter., The opinions of a number on this sub, ject are given :, Advice of Experiment Station Workers., Prof. T. C. Johnson, director of the, Virginia Truck Experiment Station,, Norfolk, Va., says: j, "We think it a very good practice, for the farmer to purchase lime dur- I, ing the fall and winter for immediate, application or for application prior to, planting crops in the early spring. In, the trucking section it is customary to, procure lime during the winter months, and apply it on such crops as cabbage,, lettuce,- tomatoes, cantaloupes and cu, cumbers, but for such crops as beets, and potatoes lime usually should he, applied on the crops preceding those, mentioned. We are advising farmers, to secure the lime at the earliest date, possible 011 account of the difficulty in, transportation r.nd labor.", Dr. H. J. Patterson, director of the, Maryland Experiment Station, says:, "We have gotten very good results, by applying lime during the winter as, a top dressing on wheat and fall seed, ed grasses. We do not advise this as, being the best method of applying, lime, but lime applied in this way has, proven beneficial both to the grain and, grass which follows the wheat.", Dr. Jacob G. Lipnian, soil chemist,, dean and director of the New Jersey, Agricultural Experiment Station, says:, "The wisdom of purchasing and, spreading lime in the fail and winter, is entirely proper. At this particu, lar time, when farm labor is costly, and scant as to supply, the conserva, tion of the efforts of the farmer should, be urged in every possible way. In, deed, it has been our practice for, some time past to advise farmers In, New Jersey not to leave certain of, the farm work that may bo done in, the winter until early spring.", Dr. Elmer O. Fippin, professor of, soils, Cornell University and Colleg e^, of Agriculture, Ithaca. N. Y., says:, "In the matter of the ordering and, use of lime in the winter • * * we, have emphasized the importance of, farmers ordering their lime in the win, ter because of difficulties of getting, cars in the spring : also they then have, more time for such work. We also, recommend In our regular work the, practice of applying lime In the winter, any time when the ground is essential, ly bare of snow. While we prefer, that It be applied to land that Is to be, plowed or to he given cultivation be, fore the crop is planted, we do not, object to a man applying it to a crop, already established, hut with the un, derstanding that his immediate bene, fits are not likely to he as large as, where the lime can be more thorough, ly Incorporated with the soil.", Use of the Concentrated Forms of, Lime Saves Labor., Considering these statements of the, leading agriculturalists, in view of de, fact that a high percentage (approxi, mately 85 per cent.) of die soils east, of the Mississippi river are sour ami, badly in need of lime and that the, shortage of labor and transportation, facilities is severe, the farmer should, not hesitate to secure a liberal sup, ply of lime now for immediate appli, cation and home storage., In the purchase of liming material, the farmer should give careful consid, eration to its chemical composition,, bearing in mind that the concentrated, form of lime, which is the lump and, the hydrate, possesses nearly twice the, neutralizing power v of that of the vari, ous finely pulverized limestones., a, a, 20, 40, be, !, *, Eighty millions of men can- 4, 4 not be taken out of production 4, : Mir :, 4 before their, fields recuperate, 4, 4 farms are restored and herds re- 4, 4 stocked.

Food Administration from the, principal grain growing states, it is, now possible to announce with fair ac, curacy the amount of wheat saved last, harvest by improved methods of han, dling. According to official calcula, tions, efforts toward cleaner threshing, saved fully 16,000,000 bushels of wheat, with corresponding savings of other, small grain harvested and threshed In, a similar manner. In addition, other, states, though unable to furnish fig, ures, reported greatly reduced harvest, losses., The figure for wheat alone is equiv, alent to seven one-pound loaves of, bread for every person in the United, States and represents food that form, erly was either an absolute loss or, was recovered to only a slight extent, by poultry and livestock. While op, portunities in this branch of conserva, tion were large, the quantity of grain, recovered surpasses early expecta, tions. It is noteworthy also that re, sults were secured principally through, voluntary co-operation., No conservation measure of the, Food Administration, It is declared,, has received more wholehearted sup, port than that pledged and rendered, by farmers and threshermen toward, reducing grain waste at its source., fo, for;, 1, at, of, la-, it, of, by, to, j, I, to, to, as, as, e^, L., by, ed, Vf, [4, -71 IT) ra*, L»J, I, iTml, [»I if., The beneii 1 s of our food-saving, campaign that was a vital factor In, the winning of the war were not all to, these we fed.

Many of j, them have become accustomed to a;, scale of living better than they have\', ever known. In the last two years!, • nearly one million women have taken\', Jobs either formerly held by men or\', newly created jobs which under ordi-j, nary circumstances would be filled. by|, men., Three million ablebodied men are, now either actually In service or being, called to training camps. Over flve (, million laborers are actually engaged\', in factories And plants directly and, wholly occupied in making war mate, rial. Another five million are engaged, in quasi-war Work., What will happen to these millions, when peace is declared? What will, become of the "war jobs?" What will, happen to the high level of wages?, The moment peace is declared the, United States Goveftiment and other, Governments will cancel their im, mense* outstanding orders and con, tracts for war material. Automatic, ally this will throw millions out of, employment unless provision is made, nhead of time to find work for them, during the period of reconstruction., . This advance preparation cannot be, made in a day, a week or a month. It, is a more gigantic task to prepare for, this than it was to prepare for war., We have been engaged in war now, over eighteen months, and we still are, dependent upon England and France, for munitions, guns, clothing, \' ships, and much other war material. If the, present administration of affairs could, pot put the nation on a war basis In, eighteen months how leng would it, take the same leaders to put the na, tion on a peace basis?, These questions only Indicate the, very serious problems which labor, must confront immediately upon the, declaration of peace. Republican con, gressmen contend that it is necessary, that this government should immedi, ately take steps to safeguard labor, during that period after the war when, Industry Is readjusting Itself. They, contend that labor should be protected, from the flood of cheap products, abroad and from enforced idleness qt, home.. Republican leaders are back of, the Week\'s Reconstruction Bill, which, would*create a bipartisan committee to, begin immediately the framing of poli, cies to meet these emergencies., The F fen eh people say they hold Re, publican leaders in America next to, American generals In their esteem, be, cause Republican leaders have alwavs, STOOD BY THE WAR., WHO GIVES MONEY, AND WHO GETS IT, Official Data on South\'s Contribu, tion to Third Liberty, Loan., In a recent issue of the Literary, Digest there appeared a series of ad, vertisements inserted by a Southern, advertising agency on behalf of the, newspapers of Southern states. One, of these ads reads in part as follows;, "Subscriptions of the Southern people, to Liberty Bonds exceed the average of, the United States. Returns from sub, scriptions for the Third Liberty Loan, show\' that every Southern district very, •largely oversubscribed its quota. - * •, How did this happen? No one contends, that the Southerner is more patriotic, than the rest of his countrymen. But as, the above figures show clearly that he, invested more liberally in Liberty Bonds, than his brethren, there is only one, reasonable deduction—he has more money, to spend. You can\'t get away from, • • You don\'t have to wait till, harvest time in the South, as in the, North and Wesit, when the farmer is, supposed to have more money,, day is harvest time in the South.", This effort to make it appear that, the South did more than its «hare in, subscribing to the Third Liberty Loan, is not sustained by the data issued by, the United States Treasury Depart, ment. The official figures taken from, the treasury department\'s report of, the Third Liberty Loan shows that the, Fourth Southern Federal "Reserve Dis, trict subscribed only $639,965,050 out, of a total national subscription of, $4,176,516,850, or only about 15 per, cent, of the« total subscriptions of the, United States, nothwithstanding the, four Southern federal reserve districts, comprise one-third of the federal re, serve districts of the United States., The $639,965,050 the Southern states, contributed to the Third Liberty Loan, is but little more than the amount of, money the government spent in those, states building army cantonments,, camps and other military plants. In, other words, the South did but little, more than lend to the government the, equivalent of the nHllions in real, money the government had actually, {given the South. Counting in the mil, lions of dollars northern soldiers sent, to southern camps and friends of, nocthern soldiers visiting them In, southern camps spent in the South, the, South did not lend the United States, as much money in the Third Liberty, Ix>an as the United States pad spent, In the South since April, 1817.
