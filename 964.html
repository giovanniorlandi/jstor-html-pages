S r\nMILK MADE INTO POWDER.\nRecent Invention of Which Swedish Manufact\nurers Are Preparing to Take Advantage.\nAn important movement ap\npears to be on foot in Sweden\nfor the conversion of skimmed\nor separated milk into a dry\npowder, by means of a machine\ncalled an “exsiccator,” invented\nby Dr. Martin Ehenberg. The\nprice of one of these machines to\nevaporate 528 gallons of milk\nin ten hours is stated somewhat\nvaguely to be from £220 to £280,\nsays the London Standard. It\nwas recently reported that ten\nsets of apparatus were being\nerected in Swedish dairy facto\nries and that inquiries about the\nmachine from butter makers in\nSweden and foreign countries\nwere numerous.\nThe powder, when dissolved in\na proper quantity of water of\nthe right temperature, resumes\nthe appearance and other char\nacteristics of milk. As the annu\nal output of separated and skim\nmed milk in Sweeden is estimated\nat over 158,000,000 gallons, the\nsupply of the powder from that\ncountry alone, if it proves a com\nmercial success, will be very\nlarge, and in all other countries\nwhere butter is extensively pro\nduced the difficulty of finding\na profitable use for this product\nis felt, as the return for it when\nit is used as food for calves or\npigs is small. Although sepa\nrated milk is almost devoid of\nfat, its ailamentary value is con\nsiderable, and. in the form of\npowder, a large quantity of it\ncan be transported in a small\ncompass. It is stated that the\npowder can be kept good for an\nindefinitely long period.\nThe first Settlers.\nThe first settler has made his\nappearance on the land set aside\nin Nevada by Uncle Sam to\ncome under the national irriga\ntion scheme. He has chosen for\nhis farm to-be a piece of land be\ntween Wadsworth and the canal\nsite. He believes it will be No. 1\nland for alfalfa.\nThe first settler\'s name is Rob\nert Graham; he hails front I»u\nlutli, Minn, and he has come to\nstay. He brought with hin a\nwife, a young daughter, and a\nmother. He has a span of\nhorses, has lumber here ready to\nhaul and tn sufficient quantity to\nbuild a rather pretentious house.\nAmong the first purchases\nby him was a ton and a half of\nhay from a rancher. Other sup\nplies have been bought from lo\ncal merchants. Every settler\ncoming in will have to buy hav,\ngrain and vegetables and sup\nplies from the merchants.\nWhat can the man do who set\ntles on this land now? He can\nfile under the homestead law on\n160 acres, but the filing is sub\nject to the ruling ol the Interior\nDepartment and it is likely he\nwill be allowed only SO acres\nHe can put his house on the\nland he files upon. It he has a\nhorse he can have work for him\nself and his horse from the con\ntractors who are building the\nbig canal. If he is steady, he\ncan have steady work, ami when\nthe canal is completed he can\nhave enough money to clear his\nland of sagebrush, fence it and\nplant part of it. ,\nMr. Graham, living forehanded\nand having faith in Nevada’s ir-1\nligation scheme, intends to have\nthe land ready for irrigation\nwith the first water that flows\nthrough the great canal, and\nhaving visited the Sink country\nexpressed his opinion regarding\nthe lands covered by the canal\nas being the future garden spot\nand feed depot for the central\nwest.—Wadsworth Dispatch.\nNewspaper failures.\nIt has been ascertained on tbe\nauthority of wbat appears to\nbe reliable statstics that more\nnewspapers have failed in the\nUnited States during the past\nten years than are now pub\nlished in the same territory. Of\ncourse the chief number of fail\nures has been among newl v em\nbarked enterprises. Of these,\nonly one in twenty has survived.\nThe outsider usually thinks he\ncan conduct a newspaper much\nbetter than the editor and it is\nthis fatuous belief that leads to\nso many new enterprises in the\nnewspaper field. The job looks\neasy and attractive and alluring\nand the novice is firmly con\nvinced that all he needs is a\npress and some type and he will\nimmediately set the world on\nfire.\nThe expense of the undertak\ning is never considered until the\nhazardous voyage is well under\nway, and then Mr. Novice can\nthink of nothing else than the\nexpense. With all his well rcog\nnized genius for journalism, it\ncost William R. Hearst some\nthing like $2,000,000 to put the\nNew York Journal on a paying\nbasis.\nBeef Will Advance.\n“A month from now there will\nbe very little beef to be had in\nthis locality, and what there is\nwill bring a better price than\nwould be offered today.” This\nis the opinion expressed a few\ndays ago by James Nelson, stock\nman of Butter Creek, and is\nagreed with by not a few of the\ncattlemen who are awake to\nwhat is taking place, says the\nPendleton, Oregon, Tribune.\n‘ Everything that is beef now,”\nthey argue, “is going out and no\none seems to take the risk of\nwintering what they have, let\nalone keeping fat what is now\nready for the block ”\nThe few who can take advant\nage of the abnormal condition of\nthings and hold on to what\nthey have, keeping a percentage\nof their beef at home all the\ntime, w ill be the ones to reap the\nbenefit from the other man’s\nlack of judgment.\nSpraying With Nicotine.\nLieutenant Governor Lem Al\nlen uses a rather unique sub\nstance tor spraying his orchard\non the home ranch in Churchill\ncounty. It is nothing more nor\nless than nicotine, or tobacco\njuice. It conies all prepared for\nuse as a sheep dip, and is likely\nmanufactured by boiling down\ntobacco stems and waste from\nthe tobacco factories. Mr. Al\nlen’s spray tank holds about\nforty gallons, and to this\namount of water he puts two\nthirds of a bott e of the dip and\ndrops in five or six pounds of\nunslacked lime. He has met\nwith splendid success in conquer\ning the codlin moth, the woolly\naphis and other jiests of similar\nnature. It is likely that it w-ould\nnot prove efficatious against the\nscale insects, but it is a good\nthing for orchardists to know.—\nCarson News.\nSenator William M. Stewart,\nof Nevada, was married Mon\nday night at the Piedmont\nHotel, Atlanta, Ga., to Mrs.\nMary A. Cone, the young widow\nof Theo. C Cone, of Georgia.\nThey met in Washington, where\nMrs. Cone has lived for several\nyears. The ceremony was per\nformed in private, only a few\nfriends being present. Rev. H. S.\nBradley performed the ceremony.\nThey go to Washington for their\nhoneymoon. Senator Stewart’s\nbride is thirtj’ years his junior.\nWHO OARROT BE OUREO.\nBacked up by over a third of a century\nof remarkable and uniform cures, a record\n•uch as no other remedy for the diseases\nand weaknesses? peculiar to women ever\nattained, the proprietors and makers of\nDr. Pierce’s Favorite Prescription now feel\nfully warranted in offering to pay $500 in\nlegal money of the United States, for any\ncase of Leucorrhea, Female Weakness,\nProlapsus, or Falling of Womb which they\ncannot cure. All they ask is a fair and\nreasonable trial of their means of cure.\nThey have the most remarkable record\nof cures made by this world-famed remedy\never placed to the credit of any prepara\ntion especially designed for the cure of\nwoman’s peculiar ailments.\nA beautiful Georgia lady, Vice-President of\nthe Hast End Palmetto Club, of Savannah, and\nprominent socially there, relates the following\nexperience: "You certainly have produced the\nfinest medicine for suffering women that is to\nbe had in the country.

Stubbs, Director of\nthe Agricultural Experiment\nStation in Reno makes inquiry in\nregard to holding a Farmers’\nInstitute in Mason Valley this\ncoming Winter. Dr. Stubbs\nwrites as follows :\n“We believe that the next few\nyears will see great progress in\nthe lines of agriculture and the\ncattle industry in this State.\nThe members of our Experiment\nStation staff are beginning to\nhold Farmer’s Institutes in dif\nferent parts of the State, and it\nhas occurred to them that we\ncould make a beginning in Yer\nington. The Farmers’ Institutes\nmean not simply that our prof\nfessors lecture to the farmers\nand tell them what to do, for\nthey very well know that in\nranching experience is a very\ngood teacher. They want to\nhear from the farmers. They de\nsire to give and get information\nand instruction upon these lines\nwhich are of common interest\nand worth. The efforts which\nare now making toward irriga\ntion by the government of the\nUnited States will bring an in\ncreased population to Nevada,\nand with the increased popula\ntion will come new questions\npertaining to agriculture and\nstock-raising. There will be\nmany small farms of 80, 120\nand 160 acres The population\nof this State, will be at least\n100,000 within five years.”\nIf there is any agricultural sec\ntion in Nevada that could be\nbenefited more by a Farmers’ In\nstitute than Mason Valley we\ndo not know where it is. As\nDr. Stubbs has said, it is not for\nthe purpose of telling the farm\ners how to conduct their farms\nparticularly that these institutes\nare held, but to get together and\nrub your ideas against those of\nyour neighbors in regard to the\nraising of this, that and the\nother crop. It might be. how\never, that some of the scientific\ntheoretical plans as demonstrat\ned by the proffessor’s experi\nments might be of great advant\nage it put to practical tests. The\nindustry of intense farming—\nmaking every foot of ground\nproduce all it will at a minimum\ncost without injury to the land,\nis becoming more necessary each\nyear. Small farms will in a few\nyears be the order of all thriv\ning agricultural sections, and it\nwill then be demonstrated that\nunder the changed conditions a\n40-acre farm will produce more\nthan a 400-acre farm under the\neld system. It will not be long\nbefore the home-seeker will in\nvade Mason Valley, and those\nalready here should prepare to\nreceive him. With a water stor\nage system this valley should\nhave a population of at least\n5000 people. An institute will\nbe one means of advertising our\nresources, and it should be the\nmeans of bringing all of us to\ngether for the common cause of\nbuilding up and improving our\ncommunity. By all means let\nus have a Farmers Institute, and\nlet’s make it a rousing one.\nCongressman Van Duzer has\nmade the statement that Sen\nator Stewart will be a candi\ndate for re-election to the United\nStates Senate. In connection\nwith this statement the Con\ngressman says that Stewart re\ncently made a vicious attack on\nunion labor, and is therefore an\nideal candidate for the Republi\ncans to support. If our pie-faced\nCongressman will look back a\nfew years, to the time he was a\nmember of the Nevada Assembly\nand contemplate the abortive\nattempt of that session to “do\nsomething’’ for the union labor\ners, he will find that the Repub\nlican party is not the one that\nflim-flatned the laborers of Nev\nada. By the way, when and\nwhere did Stewart make this\n“vicious attack upon union\nlabor ? ”\nThe last of the machinery\nin the Carson mint is being\ntaken away. The Carson mint\nis situated in the heart of a vast\nbullion producing country, and\nenough bullion is produced in\nNevada to keep it running stead\nily, but for some unknown rea\nson this bullion is shipped to\nSan Francisco and Salt Lake.\nIt is a shame to see the old mint\ndismantled. Probably if we had\nsmelters and refineries close to\nthe mint it would be kept in\nworking order, and this con\ndition of things may come about\nin the very near future. As the\nmint now stands it is simply a\nrelic of by-gone days, when $20\npieces were as plentiful as silver\ndollars are now, or more so.\nThe land frauds in Washing\nton and Oregon, while probably\nnot as great as reported, are\nsufficiently large to merit the\nprompt and drastic measures\nbeing taken by the government\nto uncover them and punish the\noffenders. Land and timber is\nbecoming more valuable each\nyear and Uncle Sam cannot af\nford to overlook the fact. Land\ngrabbers and timber thieves\nshould be summarily dealt with,\nfor the laws as they now stand\npermit of much hogging of val\nuable government possessions\nwhich should be held for the\nhome-seeker instead of the spec\nulator.\nThe editor of the Reno Gazette\nsays that so far as he knows\nSenator Stewart will not be a\ncandidate for re-election and had\nnothing to do with the change\nof management of that paper.\nThere is more Catarrh in this sec\ntion of the country than all other\ndiseases put together, and until the\nliist few years wps supposed to be\nincurable. For a great many years\ndoctors pronounced it a local disease\nand prescribed local remedies, and\nby constantly tailing to cure with\nlocal treatment, pronounced It in\ncurable. Science has proven catarrh\nto be a constitutional disease and\ntherefore requires constitutial treat\nment. Hall’s Catarrh Cure, manu\nfactured by F. J. Cheney & Co., To\nledo, Ohio, is the only constitutional\ncure on the market. It is taken in\nternally in doses from 10 drops to a\nteaspoontul. It acts directly on the\nblood and mucous surfaces of the\nsystem. They offer one hundred\ndollars for any case it tails to cure.\nSend for circulars and testimonials.\nAddress, F. J.

Giftord.\nPersons not heeding this warning\nwill be subject to prosecution for\ntrespassing.\nMILLER & LUX.\nCause of Lockjaw.\nLockjaw, or tetanus, is caused by\na bacillus or germ which exists\nplentifully in street dirt. It is in\nactive so long as exposed to the air,\nbut when carried beneath the skin\nas in the wounds caused by percus\nsion caps or by rusty nails, and\nwhen the air is excluded the germ is\nroused to activity and produces the\nmost virulent poison known. These\ngerms may be destroyed and all\ndanger of lockjaw avoided by apply\ning Chamberlain’s Pain Ilalm freely\nas soon as the injury is received.\nPain Halm is an antiseptic and\ncauses cuts, bruises and like injuries\nto heal without maturation and in\none-third ot the time required by\nthe usual treatment. It is for sale\nby M. E.
