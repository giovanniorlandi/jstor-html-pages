A new way of making this\ntrip, leaving out the necessity of\nowning an auto, has been demon\nstrated by Frank Healy of the Rail\nroad commission. Mr. Healy had\nsome relatives from the east who had\nvisited the fair and wanted to come\nby way of Carson to visit him. In\nstead of letting them come to Retu\nby train and thence to Carson he\nwrote them to get off the train at\nTruckee. where he met them and\nbrought them by way of the little\ntrain to Tahoe Tavern, thence by\nthe boat across the lake and down\nKings canyon to Carson, enabling\nthem to catch the Virginia and\nTruckee train for Reno.

Advertise in the\nAPPEAL.\nYou no doubt wonder, Mr. Merchant, why you do not sell\' more\ngoods. But ycu shou\'dn\'t, for it is no secret.\nIf you are not selling the goods you think you should it is not\nwholly because thi people are not buying. It is because some other\nfellow is fcettinp the trade you ought to have, and that other fellow is\nmost likely the big mail order house.\nFor positive proof of this assertion, just watch the parcels post\nmail that comes to this postoffice, and watch the carloads of goods that\ncome in by freight or express all from the big mail order houses.\nThe fact that the people of this community are your friends is no\nreason why they will trade with you unless they are convinced that\nyou . can do as well \'oy them as the mail order man or the large city\nmerchant does.\nThe people even your friends will spend their money where they\ncan get the most for it, and you can not keep them from doing so.\nYou probably are doing the same thing yourself.\nMail order houses and large city merchants advertise extensively\nthe year round, and in this way they gain the confidence of the people.\nAnd the\' buyer invariably travels the road in which he has most con\nfidence. He has been led by the mail order man and the city merchant\nto believe that they can do better by him than you can do, and once\nhe gets that idea into his head you lose and they have got the trade\naway from you.\nYou can get much of this business back if you want to, but the\nonly way you can do it is to advertise, and keep on advertising. The\nsuccessful business man of today keeps a watchful eye on his compe\'i\ntor, and meets him half way.\nA well written advertisement will eventually draw the people to\nthe advertiser. The advertising, however, should be done systematically\nand the copy should be attractively prepared and frequently changed.\nWhen people spend their own money they unquestionably have a\nright to buy when and where they please. It would therefore seem\nthe part of wisdom for the local dealer to convince the buyer that\nhome is the best place to trade, and this can only be accomplished by\nappealing to their reason through intelligent and persistent advertising\nin their home paper.\nWe will cheerfully assist you in preparing such copy at any time,\nif you so desire.

Isn\'t it fair to assume that almost every farm house, and many of\nthe town houses, will receive one or more of these catalogues?\nAnd isn\'t it again fair to assume that -the people are going to paw\nover those catalogues, and look at the attractive pictures of the thous\nands of articles, and read of the "marvelously low prices" at which these\ngoods are sold?\nAnd do you think there are many who can resist the temptation\nto send for some of those very alluring "bargains," especially when\nthey are led to believe that the goods are sold by the mail order man\nfor less than what you charge?\nKnowing that to be just exactly what a great many of our country\nand town friends will do unless measures are taken to protect our local\nfirms in their legitimate territory, we ask you, seriously, what are\nyou going to do about it?\nThis office wants and stands prepared to do what it can to pro\ntect you and other local business firms from the constant encroach\nment of these numerous mail order houses who are doing so much\ntoward demoralizing local trade conditions, but we can not do it alone,\nor without your co-operation.\nThe question is, if this paper fights for you are you willing to fight\nfor yourself?\nThere is an effective remedy for this menace, if you care to apply\nit, and one which has proven successful and highly profitable in other\ncommunities.\nEffective June 15, 1915.\nSaturdays Only.\nConnecting at Reno with Southern Pacific Co., at Mound House, with\nSouthern Pacific Co., at Carson City with daily auto stage for Lake, and\nat Minden with stages for Genoa, Woodfords, Markleeville.
