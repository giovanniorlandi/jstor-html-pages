NUMBER 3.\nYERINBTON’S NEW\nSEWER SYSTEM\nYerington is now emtipped with a\nnice, little up to date sewer system\nand it is being greatly appreciated by\nthose who have connected their rc-i\ndeuces and places of business with it\nIn connection with the water system\nit will give the town a chance to be\ncome clean and sanitary.\n\\\\ lien the water system was install\ncd there were those who pay little\ntaxes, or mine, who found a great deal\nof fault with it. The system has been\nin operation now for several months,\nand Volt cannot lind a person who has\nconnected bis bouse, yard or outbuild\njugs with it who would do without it\nfur any consideration. And, even the\nknockers arc beginning to think tin\n•.\'•stent is all ri dit And it is, witlr the\nexception of needing a few more hy\ndrants, which can be installed at small\nexpense as the citv acquires money\nwith which to accomplish tilings\nThe sewer system has been under\ngoing the same evolution a» the water\nsvstoni. When tried out after com\npletion it worked in a most satisfac\ntorv manner Unfortunately the elec\ntrie power by which the pump i~ run\nfailed for quite a time and it was nec\nessary to tint a gasoline engine to\nwork on the plant. There were also\na few leaks in the discharge line from\nthe pump\'pit to the septic tank. These\nthings, ot course, gave the non pro\n•lucer. non constructor, non builder\nand non competent a chance to decry\nthe sewer svstem and trv and discredit\nthe City Dads for milting in a bad\npiece of work. However, the leaks in\nthe discharge line have been repaired\n(it is strange there were any in a 3\'/2\nutile line of pipe) and the motor,\npump and whole system is working\nlike a charm. In a few months the\nknockers will have forgotten about\nthere oier being any trouble with the\nsewer, the same as most of them have\nforgotten about there being any trou\nble with the court house and the water\nsvstem. There is no doubt that they\nwill long for something else to find\nfault with, but it is safe to say they\nwill not (Mill out of the towm where all\nthese imrovements are being made,\neven for the town’s good, to locate\nwhere these modern conveniencies\ncannot be had.\nVcrington i~ now in a position to ad\nvertise herself to the outside world as\na clean and sanitary little city, with a\nmodern water and sewer system, and\nas a growing and htt-tling little city,\nfar ahead, on these lines, of many\ncities of three or four times her size\nanywhere on the Pacific coast\nAN ENJOYABLE OCCASION.\nRailroad Anniversary Day Banquet\nat Ludwig.\n(>11 Tuesday evening of thi- week\nthe annual banquet to the Nevada\nCupper Belt railroad employes was\ngiven at Ludwig in the new Club\nHouse recently completed by the Ne\nvada Douglas Copper Co.

The\n\\ crington boys went down to defeat\nby a score of 58 to J3, not on account\nof poor material in our team but due\nto more practice by the Gardnerville\nteam, who have the opportunity of\npracticing nearly every evening in the\nweek. Our boys are handicapped in\nnot having a place to train properly.\n\\\\ iiat practice they get is snatched\nunder difficulties a few moments after\nschool. We are much in need of n\ngymnasium. In spite of lack of prac\ntice our boys surpassed in basket\nthrowing Dai and Francis seldom\nmissed scoring when the ball reached\ntheir hands Mason played a fast\ngame at center and \\sv and Fritz, as\nguards, hounded their men closely.\nGardnerville will play in Ycrington\nlater and our boys have decided to\nmake them haul down their colors.\nSaturday last the boys returned by\nway of Carson and Dayton, vi-iting\nthe State capitol and the State prison.\nProf Bartlett evidently had not for\ngotten the location of the pantries in\nDayton, for soon after arriving there\nhe disappeared, but soon reappeared\nwith a huge pie, much to the delight\nof the boys. Good old Dayton! Her\ncooks are still masters of the culinary\nart when it comes to making pump\nkin pies.\nThe line up of the two teams was\nas follows:\nGardnerville Ycrington\nlensen . . .

He is^ being\nhe’d to await the action of the Federal\ngrand jury.\nIMPORTANT COURT DECISION.\nCase of Dayton Ranchers Decided\nAfter Long Litigation.\nA case that brings back to the mom\norv of old-timers in Lyon county some\nof the first settlers in the county, was\nrecently decided by Judge Langan,\nafter it had been in the courts for\nsome time.\nThe case was that of Pietro Cassi\ntielli vs. Patrizio and Lorenzo Vetv\nturi, partners. It appears that in 1K05\nFish and Barrett were the Joint own\ners of a ranch opposite Dayton and\nthey concluded to divide their prop\nerty and P\'ish took the northern half\nand Barrett took the southern half of\nthe ranch. They had two dams in the\nCarson river from which they diverted\nwater for purposes of irrigation, and\nstock and domestic purposes and they\nagreed-to keep and maintain said dams\ni at their own expanse. "Fish and Bar\nrett and their successors in interest\nand grantees lived up to this agree\nment by sending men and teams to\nmake repairs every year as the same\nmight be required, until the year 1907\nwhen a flood washed away nearly ev\nery dam oil the Carson river, and Cas\nsinelli sent word to the Venturis to\n-end men and teams and contribute\ntheir proportionate share towards the\n, rebuilding of the dams., which had\nbeen completly washed away. The\nVenturis failed to contribute any part\nof their share, and Cassinelli rebuilt\none of the dams, and demanded pay\n; ment of one half of the expense, which\npayment was refused to be made. The\nprincipal legal question that arose was\nwhether the contract entered into be\ntween p\'ish and Barrett was a contract\nrunning with the land, and binding\nupon the successors in interest and\ngrantees of P\'ish and Barrett.\nWithin two or three days after Judge\nLangan announced his decision in fa\nvor of plaintiff and allowing him the\nfull amount claimed in his complaint\nPatrizio Venturi came to Yerington\nand paid to the Clerk of the Court the\nfull amount of the judgment obtained\nbv Cassinelli, and that payment closed\nthe incident.\nAll of the old residents of this sec\nti<ut remember G C P\'i-li. spoken ol\nabove, and also A. J. Barrett, who.\nafter selling his ranch near Dayton\nmoved to Mason Valley and was for\nmany years a resident here.\nPOPULAR COUPLE WED.\nQuietly Depart for Reno Where Knot\nis Tied.\nAmly West and Miss Carrie Gifford\nboth of this place, left last Sunday fot\nReno, informing hut a few of theii\nfriends of their inte.nt to enter tlu\nmatrimonial life.

They\nare expected to be back in Yerington\nin a few days to take up a permanent\nresidence, and it is predicted that tin\ncharivari gattg will make things inter\ncsting lor them upon their return.\n-x\nUnusual Case.\nAt a session of Court held in Cursor\nthis w -ek an unusual case came befori\nJudge Langan. who was presiding\nSome time ago Jennie l\'appas. an In\ndian woman, died, and among her el\nfeels were found four certificates ol\n$101) each for money on deposit in tlu\npostal savings bank in Carson.

Tin\ntrout are not very plentiful in thi\n-treant at the present time. The -pur\nof catching them in season is delight\nfill, and there should be no reason wlr\nthe lish would not do well here if not\ninterfered with too much by the car]\nand cattish.

The valuation of\nhorses and mules was left to the As\nsessors in their counties, and beef cat\ntie were raised from $30 per head\nto $40 per head: milch cows from $30\nto $35 per head: \'lock cattle from $17\nto $20 per head: (those assessed at\n$15 per head by agreement of last year\nwere raised to $1K) and sheep valua\ntion was fixed at $2.50 per head.\nin the matter of the telephone line\nassessments, after considerable argn\nment. the valuation was lixed at $30\nper mile and telegraph line values\nwere lixed the same as last year—$40\nper mile.\nThe Board, after receiving cqjisider\nable legal advice, came to the conclu\nsion that all mortgages were assess\nable the same as other property.\nIn the matter of the assessment of\nthe Pullman Car Co., after consider\nable discussion the rate of valuation\nwas fixed the same as last year—$300\ntier mile. Last year this company re\nfused to pay on this valuation in Min\neral Xve. Esmeralda and White Pine\nI counties, and suit\' arc now pending\nin the Federal Court on this adjust\nment.\nThe Board took tip the Wells, Fargo\n& Co. matter and eventually raised the\nvaluation of this company\'s property\nfrom $300 to $950 tier mile over which\nits business is handled on the basis of\nthe business transacted. The Ameri\ncan Kxpress Co. was assessed at $90\nper mile, and the Globe at $15 per\nmile.\nThe Southern Pacific Co. was as\nsessed at the same rate as last j^ear—\nj $35,IKK) per mite on main line and $6,\nIHIO per mile on sidetracks and double\ntrackage. As the system will be prac\ntically double tracked through the\nState this year it will bring the valu\nation up to $41.000 per mile.\nThese valuations will add consider\nably to the total valuation of property\nin the State, and as new property is\nbeing created in nearly every county\nthe Mate should be in a pretty good\nfinancial condition this year.\nWhat needs now to be done is a reg\nulation or adjustment of rates, making\nthe rate for each county as near alike\nas possible, so that one county will not\nbe paying more than its just propor\ntion of money to carry on the State\ngovernment.\nDEATH OF W.

Fairbanks.\nMINING PUBLICITY.\nIn Salt Lake City a movement\nhas been started by\' the men at\nthe head of the mining exchange\nto inaugurate a period of public\nity. The intention is to operate\nthe publicity bureau in connection\nwith the exchange and the avowed\n. purpose is to promote the welfare\nof U tah mining, advertise the min\neral resources of the State and to\nobtain for the use of the public\naccurate ami up-to-the-minute in\nformation in regard to the mines\nof Morinondom.\nThe big complaint of the mining\nexchange officials and others in\nterested in having the gospel of\nmining opportunity spread in an\nintelligent manner, through tht\nuse of printer\'s ink, is that the\ncommercial club of Salt Lake City\nand other civic organizations de\nvote most of their time and avail\nable funds to advertising the dry\nfarming possibilities of the State\nof Utah to the practical neglect of\nthe intermountain empire’s great\nest industry. It is to cure this sit\nuation and keep the country at\nlarge informed along all lines of\nthe mining industry that the pres\nent movement is under way. R.\nJ. Evans, President of the Salt\nLake City Mining Exchange, who\nhas in charge the new publicity\npropaganda, has made the follow\ning statement, among other\nthings:\n“The object of the organization\nshall be for the protection of the\ninterests of the owner, producer\nand investor in the mineral indus\ntry of the State of Utah. The\nfunctions of this organization\nshall include advertising, collect\ning and distributing accurate and\nreliable information relative to tin.\nmining resources of the State.\nWith the above carried into effect,\nit seems it would create such a\nconfidence and such a sense of se\ncurity that any suspicion or hesi\ntation on the part of the investing\npublic, to the mining industry,\nwould be removed and their sup\nport secured.”\nADVERTISING.\nQuite a number of people in\nYerington are receiving the San\nFrancisco Chronicle now with a\npaid-up three-months’ subscrip\ntion marked on the paper. Many\nmore people throughout the State\nare also probably receiving the\npaper under similar conditions.\nThey have not subscribed for that\npaper, but they need not fear to\ntake it from the postoffice and\nthen have to pay for it. Some\nbody else has paid for your sub\nscription so that you may read\nwhat the Chronicle has to say in\nthe way of boosting the Panama\nExposition. There are thousands\nof these papers being sent to Ne\nvada people now. It costs money\nto do this, but it pays. Califor\nnians know how to advertise.\nCOPPER LOWER.\nThere was quite a break in the\nprice of copper this week, the\nmetal being quoted as low as\n15.50. This is probably due to the\nreport of 100,000,000 pounds sur\nplus copper in this country.

Much of\nthe v.atcr is held in the mulch and is\nag\' in lost when the mulch dries out.\nIn the lirst foot of soil practically sev\nin inches is open space and into this\nthe air and water enters. Four feet\nat least is required for root develop\ni,lent, writes K. L. Adams in the Den\nVer Field and F\'arm.. In order to com\npletely tillthis a eon esponding amount\n,,t water is needed. This, however,\nwould result in saturating the soil. In\nactual practice ten inches of water\napplied to sandy loam and eighteen\ninches to clay lands will give the best\nresults. N’ot all the moisture i- avail\naide for the crop\'s needs Part of the\nmoisture is held closely to the soil\ngrains and will not he given up to the\ntrees even under very dry conditions\nThis hydroscopic water amounts to\nan immense sheet in the aggregate. It\nit this water in which most of thet\nplant foods are being dissolved This\nunavailable moisture is greater in\nclay than in sandy soils as the amount\nof surface of the smaller grains is\nvastly larger than the coarse ones, just\nas marble has a much smaller surface\nwhile whole than when broken into a\nthousand fragments. For this reason\nthe n reentage must he maintained at\na higher point for moisture in clay\nsoils than for that in sandy lands On\nthe other hand sandy soils will dry\nout much quicker than clays.\nOn the other hand excessive irriga\ntion is to he condemned as it carries\noff the soluble plant foods. If these go\ninto layers of sand or gravel, or into\nthe water table, they will he carried\noff into the natural drainage of the\ncountry. If the irrigation water goes\ndeep, although still remaining in the\nsoil, it will carry these salts below the\nreach of the roots and the chances of\nbeing returned within range will de\npend on the character of the soil in its\nrelation to its capillary power and tin\ndepth to which they rest.\nThe lavets of gravel and coarse\nsand effectually cut off capillarity and\nthe water carried below such layers\nw ith its attendant simply of plant food\nis lost. Therefore sufficient moisture\nto just reach the desired depth is all\nthat need he given. 1 he need can he\ndetermined by both the appearance of\nthe trees and the soil A slackening\nin growth and a darkening in color of\nthe foliage are indications Hut as the\nwater should not fall below a point\nto create appearances in the tree care\nfill watch must be kept on the soil it\nself. Care should he exercised to set\nthat the proper degree of moisture ex\nists to the full depth of the soil.\nA Horse that Really Wept.\nFor ten years two good friends, a\nman and a horse, had lived together;\nfor ten years they had worked side\nhv side, in rain or sunshine, the ani\nma! drawing the heavy cart and the\nman leading him Tips tender friend\nship continued until illness came to\nput an end to it. The carter, for it was\nhe who was the cause of proving that\nall good things must come to an end.\nwas forced to leave his work and his\ncompanion.\nTwo years after this separation, the\ncarter recognized his old friend. He\napproached him. and spoke to him\nThen followed a most surprising and\naffecting occurrence to those who saw\nit The horse, hearing the voice of\nhis old master, feeling the caress and\nthe familiar head against his cheek,\nbegan to weep; yes, actually weep,\n(treat tears Mowed from his eyes and\nran down his nostrils.\nCan you denv, after having witness\ned similar manifestations of intelli\ngence and fidelity, that the horse rcn\nsons, ai d that he has a capability\nfor affection as great as ours, tint pi os\ntionably greater than that of a large\nmajority of men who pretend to care\nfor horses but who only martyr and\ntorture the poor animals?\n-A —\nGENERAL FARM NOTETS.\nThe well drained garden has many\nthings\' in its favor.\nTruck farming in this country is tu>t\nyet being overdone.\nThe tractor is going to be the new\ncst and biggest help to the farmer.\nWoven wire fence is being bought\nby the mile instead of by the rod now.\nBeg, borrow or buy all the wood\nashes you can to use in the garden;\nwork it well into the soil\nDon’t cat anv eggs from your best\nhens.

Hens that are\nover three years old seldom lay at all\nin cold weather, so unless they are\nwanted for spring breeders because of\ntheir individual excellence, they should\nhave been marketed as soon as they\nstopped laying and began to moult in\nthe fall.\nVoting hens that moult late will not\nbe apt to begin now before midwinter\nunder any system of breeding for it\ntakes longer in cold weather to get\nback to laying condition. The early\nmoulted hens and the well grown pul\nlets are the only ones that can be ex\npected to lay now, and whether they\ntlo or not depends as much on their\ncondtion at the beginning of cold\nweather and on general care as on\nfeeding.\nThe feeds needs to lie well balanced\n—that is they need a variety of the\nfoods that contain all the elements of\ngtowth and egg production. “Plenty\nof corn and water” is not a good egg\nration and if that is practically all the\nfeed they get they can hardly be ex\npected to lay many eggs, for they\nhaven\'t the kind of material they need\nWheat is a much better food for lay\ning hens than so much corn, and in\nthe absence of that, bran is a most ex\ncellent substitute.\n\\ mixture of bran, meat meal and\nbone meal mav be fed dry in a hop\ntier or the bran may be moistened\nwith milk and seasoned with a little\nsalt and pepper, with a little of the\nmeat meal added.\n-x\nThe World’s Best Holstein.\nTo Creamelle Vale, a Holstein cow,\nowned at Dutchland Farm, Brockton,\nMassachusetts, now belongs the dis\ntinction of being the world\'s greatest\nmilk producer She has just complet\ned a year\'s test, the result of which by\nofficial announcement shows the boun\nicons yield of I4.5IX) quarts, or 29,\n563 pounds of milk\nCreamelle Vale has far outstripped\nall competitors.

The way to lind the ans\nwer is to weigh the cow\'s milk and test\nit with the Babcock tester, thus find\ning out how much butterfat it con\ntains. Not a herd has been tested in\nCalifornia but that the owner discov\nered that some of his cows were not\nworth their feed. Yet, probably not\none in fifty of the dairymen in Cali\nfornia tests his milk regularly or\nknows how many cows he has that\nare consumers instead of producers of\nwealth.\n1 he way out is the forming of cow\ntesting associations. Groups of dairy\nmen, owning together from 700 to 13lK)\ncows, can organize and employ a man\nto test monthly the milk of each of\ntheir cows. 11 is records and reports\nhelp the dairyman to get rid of in\nefficient cows, and to breed up im\nproved herds, and the gain in profit is\nlikely to be five times as great as the\ncost of the testing.\nHow to start and how to operate\nsuch a testing association is set forth\nby i’rof. Leroy Anderson of the Uni\nversity of California in a bulletin on\n"Three Years\' Work of the Ferndale\n(Humboldt County) Cow Testing As\nsociation," obtainable by any one by\nwriting to the College of Agriculture\nat Berkeley.\nDenmark, with about the same pop\nulation as California, but only a tenth\nthe area, has more than five hundred\nsuch milk testing associations, the\nlirst of which was started in 1895.\nSweedcn, only a little larger than Cali\nfornia, hut with twice the population,\nhas nearly seven hundred. And Cali\nfornia has only three—at Modesto,\nTulare and Ferndale. If the dairy\nmen would organize for this work all\nitp and down the State the movement\nwould in a few years add millions to\ntheir annual prolits.\nWhat hapnens in the Ferndale dis\ntrict points the moral. In eight herds\nthere, counting some six hundred\ncows, for which the association milk\ntester has kept records since 1909, the\naverage yield of butterfat per cow in\ncreased in three years from 251 pounds\ntier annum to 291.5—a gain of 40\npounds, or an average gain of $12 per\ncow tier annum. One member raised\nhis average per cow from 256 pounds\nper annum to 335 pounds. \\\\ hen the\ntesting began he found that “Scary"\nwas producing at the rate of only 148\npounds a year. "Jennie" at 150 and\n"Lousv" at 156, whereas a cow that\ndoes not produce 200 pounds a year\nof butterfat eats more than the value\nof her milk. So "Scary" and "Lousy"\nwent into the sausage machine, and at\nthe end of the third year the poorest\nyielder in the herd gave 211 pounds of\nbutterfat. while "Fritz" w as giving 471.\n"Pansy" 467, "Dina" 456. And these\nemvs that gave over 450 pounds of but\nterfat a year cost practically no more\nto feed and care for than “Scary” and\n“Lousy,” which gave only a third as\nmuch, and had been a heavy drag on\ntheir owner instead of a help.\nThere ought to be hundreds of such\nassoc ation- in California, instead of\nthree Any neighborhood that has\ntwenty or thirty dairymen owning\namong them a thousand cows, more or\nless. within five miles, say, of a com\nmon center, can well afford to start\na milk te-ting association—nay, more,\ncannot afford not to. Any community\nthat wants to do this can have the\nUniversity\'s advice and aid. for upon\nrequest front a local committee any\nwhere in California the University will\ngladly send one of its agricultural fac\nultv to help such a local association\nto -tart on the right lines.—Live Stock\nand Dairy Journal.\nPOULTRY NOTES.\nHave the floor clean and dry under\nthe litter.\nGeese must have a large range and\nplenty of water.\nIdleness is not conducive to a high\npercentage of fertile eggs.\nBreeding ducks should he feel twice\na day. morning and evening.\nMilk fed chicks have become a\nstandard in fancy markets.\nFowls that have had roup have a\ntendency to transmit the disease to\ntheir offsnring.\nHaphazard selection of the breeding\nstock is often directly responsible for\npoor results in hatching.\nUnless all the elements for the for\nmation of eggs are put into the hen\'s\nbody she cannot be expected to lay\nwell.\nVentilation, which means fresh air\nand sunshine, is of exereme import\nance all through the winter.\nChicks that fail to develop steadily\nshould he punch marked so they can\neasily be distinguished when the time\nfor selecting breeding stock arrives.\n-x\nNotes.\nThe underfed pig will be only a loss\nThe last tiling before bedtime be\nsure to give the work teams a chance\nto drink.\nHurrying through the milking saves\ntime but it does not help the mill?\nflow.
