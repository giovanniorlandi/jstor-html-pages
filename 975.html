Dyspepsia Cure\nPull Account of Republi\ncan City Convention\n,The Republican municipal con\nvention was held last evening in\nCity Hall. More than 300 citi\nzens were present, making proba\nbly the largest city meeting of a\npolitical character ever held here.\nChairman Dye called the meet\ning to order, and then recognized\nMayor Kirtland, who made a\nstatement regarding cea*tain pub\nlic charges that an attempt would\nbe made to defeat a certain candi\ndate by unfair means* The Mayor\nasserted that these charges were\ndeliberately false, and had been\nmade solely for the purpose of\ncausing dissension and destroying\nthe harmony that was known to\nexist in the ranks of the party.\n| He concluded by saying that the\n; only agreement that had been\n! made in discussing the organiza\ntion was regarding the tellers to\nbe appointed; that he had asked\nthe gentleman proposed for chair\n!man to have each of the candi\n| dates for Collector and Treasurer\nname one of his friends for teller\n! in order thta the counting of the,\nI vote might be absolutely satisfac\ntory and fair.\nThe chairman then named F. L.\nBlackmarr for temporary chair\nman and Roy Sutor for temporary\nsecretary. On motion, the tempo\nrary organization was made perm- j\nanent.\nOn motion, the chairman was(\nauthorized to appoint a commit\ntee of three on organization and\norder of business.\nThe chairman appointed to such\ncommittee J. II. Strickling, J. T.\nLoughnep and C. E. Bailey.\nThe committee retired and pre\npared their re port and submitted\nit to the convention. This report\ncovered the business to be trans\nacted by the convention and wasi\naccepted in due form.\nThe chairman then called for}\nnominations for the office of i\nMayor. Attorney Clifford V. |\n[Church placed the present Mayor;\n?n nomination in the following\nwell delivered and well received\naddress :\nMr. Chairman and Gentlemen\nof this Convention: ? There is\nprobably no other official that\ncomes in such close touch with\nthe welfare of all classes of citi\nzens as the Mayor of a city. And\nthis is especially true of a Mayor\nof a small city, where he is alsoi\nthe Judge of the Police court!\nThe functions of the office ot\nMayor are threefold: and in this\nrespect it is probably the only of\nfice in the land wherein are com\nbined the three great divisions of\nour system of government ? the\nlegislative, the executive and t he I\njudicial. As the presiding officer\nof the City Council, directing its,\nactions and influencing its pro- 1\ncedure, the Mayor is an aeti.v\npower in the city legislation, and\nis thus a part of the legislative j\nbranch. As the Mayor proper, i\ndirecting the police and instruct !\ning the patrolmen and other |\nguardians of the peace, he at ;\ntends to the execution of the laws j\nand regulations, and is thereby j\nthe chief of the executive branch, j\nAs the Judge of the Police court,)\nwhere he tries those persons j\ncharged with the violation of city j\nordinances, he attends to the in\nterpretation of the laws, and is j\ntherefore the head of the judi- j\nrial branch. Thus we have it\nthat the Mayor of our city helps\nto make the laws; he is the chief\npower to execute those laws, and\nhe is the one that interprets those\nlaws; three separate, distinct atidi\ncomprehensive powers given to\nno other official in all our govern\nment? towta, city, county, State\nor Federal.\nI say that the functions of the\noffice of Mayor come in the clos\nest contact with all classes of peo\nple, and. greatly affect the wel\nfare \'of all. The effects of the con\nduct of that official are far-reach\ning and comprehensive. His duties\nare manifold, and his powers are ;\nextensive. The influence of his j\npolicy is felt everywhere. It goes !\ninto the home. It touches the chil- :\ndren on the streets. It concerns j\nmen in business. ^ It affects the\nvalue of property. By maintain\ning order and preserving peace,\nby establishing cleanly surround\nings and enforcing hygienic reg\nulations a city is rendered a safe \\\nand healthful place in which to :\nlive, and consequently its prop !\nerty is rendered more desirable\nand valuable\nIt is, then, a matter of the\ngreatest concern to us all as to\nwhom we choose for Mayor. We\nrequire a man for Mayor that has\nthe interest of the city at heart\nin every sense of the word, and a\nman that has the ability to make\nthat interest effective. We want\na man that is not controlled by\nany particular interests, and is\nnot influenced by any improper\nmotives. We want a man whose\nhonesty is of the highest; whose\nintegrity is\' unimpeachable, and\nwhose fairness is unquestioned.\nWe want a man that has execu\ntive ability; one who knows how\nto organize; one who has the de\ntermination to enforce the laws\nagainst the lawless; one who has\nthe resolution to preserve peace\nand maintain order; one who has\nthe disposition to establish san\nitary conditions and sustain\nhealthful surroundings. We want\na man for Mayor that has good\nbusiness ability; a man that has\nthe capacity to direct the city\'s\nfinances; a man that hns the fac\nulty to see that the funds of the\ncity are administered wisely, ju\ndiciously and economically. In\nshort, we want a man of absolute\nhonesty, who is independent of\nany particular interests; who is\nfair in his dealing with every\nbody; who is fearless in the exe\ncution of the laws; and who is\nsafe, Round and conservative and\njudicious in his financial manage\nment. The man who has been |\ntried and tested in this very of-j\ntice, and who meets all of these re\nquirements. is the man I nomi\nnate as our candidate for Mayor,\nthe present incumbent, Mr. Lynn\nKirtland.\nMr. Kirtland has stood the test\nof this office; he has been through\nthe cruciahle, and he stands be\nfore you Unscathed and untar\nnished. Tn a year\'s term he has\nestablished a record that is a cred\nit to the city and an honor to his\nparty and himself.

Gorbitt.\npractised for considerable length\nof time bv one of the city offi\ncials, \'and with the offender still\nunconvicted. Mr. Kirtland took\ncharge and managed things in a\nbusiness-like manner from t e\nstart. Instead of spending a large\nsum of money in procuring the\nconviction of J. H. Pine, he com\npleted the prosecution against\nthat offender at a cost of only\n$100. The man was convicted, and\nis now serving his sentence.\nMr. Kirtland next gave his at\ntention to reducing the city s\ndebts, realizing that by so doing\nthe interest on those debts would\nbe lessened, and the city\'s ex\npenses curtailed. In this respect\nhe proved himself to be especially\nskillful and efficient. During the\none year that he has been in of\nfice $12,600 of the city\'s indebt\nedness in bonds and outstanding\norders have been paid; $12,600 of\ninterest-bearing debts have been\nwiped from the books. A most re\nmark able record for a city of this\nsize It was done quickly, grad\nually, and almost unknown to the\ngeneral public. On the other\nhand, taxes have been decreased;\nthe levy has been reduced from\n$1.20 to $1.10. At the same time,\nthe city has been well kept up,\ncleanly conditions have been\nmaintained, and all improvements\nasked for have been made. In or\nder to do all of this it has been\nnece?sarv to practice reasonable\neconomy. All wastefulness has\nbeen done away with ; all needless\nexpenditures have been avoided.\nIn fact, this has been one of the\nmost economical administrations\nthat this city has ever had.\nLaw and order have been main- 1\ntained with almost unprecedented\nperfection. We cannot find an\nother city of its size in the coun\ntry, with so many open saloons,\nwhere there are so few disorders\nand disturbances. Fights, af\nfrays, broils and riots are almost\nunknown. At the same time the\npolice court returns in fines and\ncosts have been greater than at\nanv other period in the history of\nthe city: showing that in those\ncases where there have been in\nfractions of the city ordinances,\nthe offenders have paid the full\npenalties for their offenses, and\nthe city treasury has received the\nbenefit of their fines.\nAll things considered, then, we\nsee that Mr. Kirtland has made a\nrecord surpassing that of any\nother Mayor that this city has\never had. lie has been a faithful\nworker, a conscientious officer, an\nimpartial judge, an honest, eco\nnomical. conservative and efficent\nfinancial manager.\nMr. Chairman, in presenting\nthe name of Mr. Kirtland.

The causes can\nbe abscribed to the severe cold\nweather, the lower market, and\nthe scarcity of desirable territory .\nAll have contributed to bring\nabout the decline. The falling off\nin activity which started in De\ncember, was continued through\nout January and February, when\nit probably reached itls climax.\nJThe opening of spring and the ad\nvent of favorable weather ought\nto start up the drill, even if the\npresent territory is. unable to stay\nthe decline which has set in in .\nthe production of high grade oil.\nIn the Pennsylvania oil districts\n95 fewer wells were completed in\nFebruary than in January, and\nthere was a drop of 1226 barrels\nin the new production. At the\nsame time there was a decrease\nof 9 in the number of dry holes,\nand the average yield of the new\nwells was 12*4 barrels. There\nwere 127 fewer wells completed\nin the districts producing Penn\nsylvania oil in January than in\nDecember, with a drop of 677\nbarrels in the new production, and\nof 20 in the number of dry holes.\nDecember completed 214 fewer\nwells than November, and there\nwas a decline of 1134 barrels in\nthe new production. At the same\ntime there was a decline of 37\nin the number of dry holes, while\nthe average yield showed a con\nsiderable increase. Seventeen\nmore wells were completed in No\nvember than in October in the oil\ndistricts of New York, Pennsyl\nvania, West Virginia and South\neastern Ohio, and the gain in new\nproduction was 1778 barrels. Tn\nnew operations the figures at the\nclose of January were behind\nthose of December by 25 rigs and\n13 wells drilling. February re\nvealed a further drop of 19 rigs\nand 13 wells drilling, and in work\nunder way was behind the record j\nof February last by 134 rigs and\n210 drilling wells.\n;The Lima-Tndiana oil fields\nlikewise made a large decrease\nand in new production the figures\nwere very close to those for the\nPennylvania oil districts. Febru\nary was behind January by 135\nwells completed, 3464 barrels\nproduction and 7 dusters. The\ndecline for the month was ovei\n50 per cent. January completed\n187 fewer wells than in February\nand there was a decrease of 2593\nbarrels new production ar(;l 23\ndry holes. Tn the Trenton rock\noil fields of Ohio and Indiana. De\ncember presented an increase\nover November of 33 wells com\npleted, 766 barrels production\nand 10 dry holes. New operations\nduring February in the Trenton\nrock fields made a gain of 11 rigs\nand fell off from the January\nfigures by 59 wells drilling. This\nwas a net loss of 48.\nThere were but 383 wells com-i\npleted in the producing regions of\nNew York, Pennsylvania, West\nVirginia and Southeastern Ohio\nin February, of these 42 were\ngassers and 95 dusters, which left\n246 productive wells with a total\nyield of 3014 barrels, or an aver\nage of 12% barrels each. This is\na slight decrease from the aver\nage for January. Only 478 wells |\nwere completed in January, and\nof these 100 were dusters and 46\ngassers. This left 332 productive\nwells with a total yield of 4280\nbatrrels or an average of 12% bar\nrels each. In the sections produc\ning high Grade oil 605 wells were\ncompleted in December, includ\ning 113 dusters and 53 gassers;\nthis left 439 productive wells\nwith an average yield of 11.3 bar\nrels to the well, which was nearly\na barrel and a half better than\nthe average for the November\nwells.\nIn the Lima-Indiana fields 240\nwells were completed in Febru\nary, which was 143 less than the\nnumber completed in the districts\nproducing Pennsylvania oil, and\nthe difference in the production\nwas only 47 barrels. Out of 383\nPennsylvania wells, 137, or near\nly 36 per cent, were dusters and\ngassers. while of the Western\nwo \'Is only 22 out of 240, or about\n1 9 |K*r cent, proved unproductive.\nIn the Trenton rock oil fields 375\nwells were completed in January,\nwhich wate 103 less than the num\nber of completed wells in the\nPennsylvania oil regions, while at\nthe same time the total yield of\nthe new wells in the Western sec\ntions was 2245 barrels the great\ner. Of the Pennsylvania wells,\nJ 146. or about 30 per cent, were\ndry holes or gassers, but in the\nLima-Indiana districts only 29\nout of 3/5, or less than 8 per cent\nwere unproductive of oil in pav\nling quantities. In December the\nTrenton rock oil fields combined\ncompleted 43 fewer wells than the\noil districts of Pennsylvania, but\nthe new production was 4151 bar\nrels greater.\nIn the high grade oil district*\nWest Virginia continues to lead\nin new wells and new production,\nand over half the total output of\nfresh production generally comes\nfrom the Mountain State. In the\nolder sections of the region, north\nof the Pennsylvania State line,\nthere was an unusually heavy de\njcline the past month. Nothing\nbetter than 2 or 3 barrel wells are\nexpected, and the closest economy\nhas to be practiced in order to\nmake them pay. ? Derrick.\nWhat February Gave\nUs In the Weather Line\nThe following has been sc%i*\nout by the Weather Bureau as a\nreport, on the conditions of\nweather for the month of Febru\nary. and is worthy to be clipped\nout for future comparison:\nDuring t h?? month there Were T> ;\nrainfalls; it raided all day the\n25th.\nOn the 5th and 8th there was\'\n#\nrain, snow and sleet.\nWe had G snows during the |\nmonth, making 10 this winter.\nThe ground has not been en- j\ntirely clear of snow and ice since |\nDecember 25.\nWe have had very little rain |\nsince the latter part of June. 1904. j\nWe account for this from the fact |\nthat about 70 pcir cent of the 52 J\ninches we calculate on each year\nfell during the early part of the,\nseason of 1904.\nFifteen days were cloudy all\ndays; 10 days the sun shone "all\nday.\nThe coldest day was the 3d,\nwith an average temperature of 2\ndegrees above. The 15th had an\naverage of 5 degrees above; the\n2d and 13th had an average of\n7 degrees above: on the 3d, 14th\nand Ifith t he thermometer regis\ntered from (> up to 10 degrees be\nlow zero: on the 2d, 4th, 13th and\n25th. zero was reached.\nThe a vera ere temperature at 7\na. m. during the month was 22 de\ngrees. at 8 p. m. 25 decrees.\nThe average mean temperature\nfor the month was 25 degrees.\nThe highest point registered\nduring the month was at noon on\nthe 7th, 50 degrees.\nI\nDouble the Amount of\nSnow This Year Than Last\nThe Weather Bureau figures,\ncompiled yesterday show that the ,\nmean temperature for the past\nthree months, December, January\nand February, has been 26.8 de\ngrees as compared with 26.4 de\ngrees for the corresponding three j\nmonths last year. Last year\'s\nfisrure was the lowest in the thir- j\nty-four years that records have j\nkept, and the two winters have\nbeen the two coldest consecutive\nwinters on record.\nThe snowfall for December,\nJanuary and February was 58.3\ninches, as compared with 28.5\nPROFESSIONAL NOTIOXS.\n?\nJ.

V\n? .. , 4\n, \'\nRepublican\nConvention\n.\n[Continued from Page 2.]\nwho has the record and the ability\nthat he possesses, and who has the\nfairness and honesty that he\nmaintains. It is because he has\nbeen tried and tested; because he\nhas demonstrated his worth; be\ncause he is a competent officer, a\ngood citizen, and a staunch and\nloval Republican, that I nominate\nas our candidate for Mayor, Mr.\nLvnn Kirtland.\nThere being no further nomi\nnations, on motion, the nomina\ntions were closed and the nomi\nnee was called upon for a speech.\nMayor Kirtland accepted the\nnomination in the following ap\npropriate words :\nMr. Chairman and Gentlemen\nof the Convention: ? It is very\ngratifying to me to be renomi\nnated for Mayor tonight by the\nunanimous voice of this conven\ntion. and I accept the nomination\nwith a full realization of the con\nfidence that is expressed by it and\nthe obligation it imposes upon me\nas a public servant. ? The unanim\nity you have shown in conferr\ning the honor carries with it the\ninference that my administration\nthe past year has been satisfac\ntory and that you are willing to\nhave me continue as the execu\ntive head of the city for another\nyear. This implied endorsement\nof my official condctisprop hmrf\nof my official conduct is properly\nappreciated and valued more\nhighly than are the emoluments of\nthe office.\nOne year ago in accepting the\nMayoralty nomination in this hall\nI stated that I had no promises\nto make other than the one that\nif elected, it would be my single\npurpose to have my administra\ntion subserve the best interests of\nthe city as those interests should\nappear to me, unprejudiced and\nuntrammeled by any secret agree\nment or understanding with any\nbusiness, clique or faction. And\nwithout egotism or attempt at self\npraise I can make truthful declar\nation to you tonight that that one\npromise has been faithfully kept\nand with a good measure of suc\ncess. The proof is the present\nsplendid financial, status of the |\ncity and its remarkable freedom\nfrom crime and disorder.\nCity affairs the past year have\nflourished as never before, thanks\nto a council that will always rank\nhigh in our municipal history as\nan effective, progressive and hon\nest body. Up-to-date business\nmethods * has characterized that\nCouncil in considering every de\ntail of the city\'s business, and the\nresult at the close of the munici\npal year on the first proximo will 1\nmake a pubfoc showing that\nshould and will inspire unstinted\npraise from every citizen who has\nthe welfare of the city at heart.\nIt is hardly necessary lot* me\nto dwell at any length upon what\nhas been accomplished by Council\nduring the year soon to close.\nYou have been following that in\npublished reports of Council pro\nceedings, and your memory has\nbeen freshened by the data given\nthis evening by the gentleman\nwho kindly placed me in nomina\ntion. There are two things, how\never. of which we are so proud\nthat further exploitation on my\npart will be pardoned. One was\nthe reduction of what seemed a\npermanent tax levy of $1.20 to\nI $1.10, with the almost certain\npromise that this rate can be low\nered to $1 next year. The othei\n[thing was the payment of old out\n! standing city orders, bearing 6\nper cent interest, and amounting\nin principal to $8875.94, besides\nthe payment from the sinking\nfund of* $3500 on the bonded in\ndebtedness, a grand total of over\n$12,000. Other accomplishments\nof varying importance might be\nmentioned, fl>ut the mentioning\nwould be second-hand and uncall\ned-for. You are acquainted with\nthe splendid record of our water\nworks the past year and of the\nother departments of the city gov\nernment.\nIn the face of this fine financial\nshowing there has been no dispo\nsition to slight public improve\nments. The policy has been econ\nomy wthout parsimony, and there\nhas been no refusal by Council\nto make any legitimate improve\nment that has been urged. This\n[statement is easily susceptible of\nverification, notwithstanding the\nreports to the contrary,\ni In conclusion, I wish to thank\n1 ? . v\nthe contention for the high rec\nognition shown me tonight, and to\nrenew my promise made last year\nthat, if elected, I shall continue\nto devote my best efforts to the\nwelfare of Sistersville I shall\nask the people for re-election this\nspring as a business proposition\nbased upon the re<*>rd of the past\nvear We have given the city a\ngood administration, and have the\nfigures to back up that assertion..\nThe chairman calle4 for nomi\nnations for the office of City\nClerk\nDr. V.
