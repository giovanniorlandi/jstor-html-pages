It Is one thing\nto get new people here, and quite an\nother to keep them. We have yet to\nle.trn this latter lesson.\nCLEAN THE CITT.\nBefore the summer months roll\naround again the efforts of the "Wo\nman\'s Club and the Push Club will\nhave resulted in the start for a clean\ner city. Th agitation for a crema\ntory Is lost on many Astorlans who\ndo not appreciate the full value of the\nundertaking of the two clubs, but be\nfore the matter is dropped c It liens will\nbe alive to the necessity of keeping\ntheir property and the streets In front\nof It just as clean as possible.\nAbout a month hence there will be\n!a joint mevXlng o tM two c,ubs and\nthe committee in charge of the meet\ning has prepared a program for the\noccasion. Representatives of the Wo\nman\'s Club will relate the difficulties\nexperienced by them in their single\nhanded effort to have vile-smelling\ngarbage piles removed; how they per\nsonally saw to It that rubbish was\ngathered in piles, and proposed to de\nstroy the filth by Are; how the police\nthreatened to arrest them if they set\nfire to the rubbish, and how they\nsneaked out of their homes at an un\nseemly hour of the morainz and. In\ndefiance of law." touched matches to\nthe disease-breeding accumulations\nthe City." Dr. Henderson will point\non Bond street below Seventh, and of\na blunt statement of fact.\nIt is the purpose also to cause the\nunsightly buildings along the water\nfront to be torn down. Legal steps\n. will doubtless be taken to accomplish\nthis result. One of the worst eye-sores\nin the city is the half-destroyed O.\nIt. & N. coal bunkers, for the exist\nence of which the company should be\nashamed of Itself. Thr are dotens\nof Just such unsightly structure, all\nover the city buildings that -are ab\nsolutely worthless and, If property\nowners will not voluntarily remove\nthem, then legal steps must be taken\nto compel removal.\nThere are a great many other firings\nthat must be taken up to beautify the\nappearance of the city, For Instance,\nthe city charter requires that tele-\ngaph and telephone poles shall be\npainted, yet the law has never been\nobserved. The fault Is not with the\nlawmakers, for the very wording; of\nthe ordinance indicated determina\ntion to compel decency. The ordin\nance governing the matter, No. 11.W,\nprovides: .\nFirst Sawed poles shall be 12 Inches\nsquure at the street grade and six\ninches square at the top, shall be plan\ned smooth on all sides and painted.\nSO AS TO PRESENT A RESPBCTA-\nBUi APPEARANCE-\nSecond Round poles shall be not\nIt ss than 10 inches la diameter at the\ngrade of the street, and shall be peel\ned and dressed, smooth and painted,\nSO AS TO PRESENT A RESPECTA\nBLE APPEARANCE.\nThere is plenty of law to back the\npresent movement, and Astoria will\npresent an Inviting appearance before j\nthe year Is over. There la no disposi\ntion to resort the legal tactics, and\nit is for this reason the clubs will en\ndeavor to Inculcate the spirit of clean\nliness by holding meetings. Doubtless\nthere will be found the usual bellig\nerents who will decline to act unless\ncompelled to do so, and for these the\nmachinery of the law will be set in\nmotion. In the meantime good citi\nzens will not wait for the club meet\nings, but start in at once to improve\nthe appearance of their property.\nCONSUMPTION\nIs like the constrictor which tiroes its\ncoils around its victim ami slov.lv \'tight\nens them until life is extimrmshtVi.\nOnce the cot!\ndrawn tight there\ni. . .i - -i ...\n. j- i u,uc limine i.\n"flt escarje.
