NOT ON YOUR LIFE\nRANT Miller, the perennial candidate, has flopped over once\nl\' more and is now trying to break into the Republican party\nAt first nothing short of a senatorial toga would meet his sanction\nand, when it was pointed out that Roberts was invulnerable for\nthat position, the apostle of Socialism, took another think and\nconcluded he would look just as well in the lower house of con\ngross. The vanity of this man surpasses all understanding. After\nhaving devoted Uie best years of his political life to berating anil\nabusing everything emanating from the Republican party from\nwhich lie was firmly evicted in his early manhood by his own po\nlitical apostaey, the forked tongued orator of the Truckee thinks\nall he has to do is to signify his willingness to accept office to\nhave the party of Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley and Taft fall down\nand adore his candidacy. Nothing doing this time. There may be\na dearth of congressional candidates this year but an abundance\nof suitable timber will be in evidence when the time comes. The\nvoters of Nevada have always relied upon a Republican in the lower\nhouse and last election showed this confidence was not misplaced\nwhen Roberts ran so far ahead of his ticket that ho was alone in\nthe running when the polls closed. The people of Nevada want a\nRepublican in both branches of congress this year, and every indi\ncation shows that the wish will come pretty close to being gratified.\nMiller was satisfied to ride the Socialist band wagon when the\nriding was good and the government was lenient about criticism\nbut, as soon as this country became involved in Europe and a gag\nplaced on disloyal utterances, the ranting Socialist- found his occu\npation gone. Therefore he sought new fields which, he thought\nwould pave the way for return to the old fold. When the nation\nbegan to grow censorious and a check was placed on reckless\nremarks about the administration and the attitude of the United\nStates at the beginning and prior to the war, Mr. Miller was jolted\nout of the lofty seat he occupied in the circus parade and landed\nwith acrobatic agility in the circle which he thought offered the\nbest opportunity for slipping through the entanglements and niak\ning a home run to Washington. Nay, nay, Pauline! Not this time\nAnother day when you have demonstrated your earnestness an\nstability to remain put, there may be an opening for an ambitious\ngrandfather. Four years from now there may be a chance to qualify\nfor the finals in congress, but not just now or at any time in th\nrear future. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.\ntotaMtaMtoik,.\nPROFITEERING AT HOME\nT7 VERY newspaper has had its columns more or less congested\nJCt recently with stories of alleged profiteering among the Na\npbleons of finance and the jugglers of contracts but no one seems\nto have paid any attention to what is going on in Nevada political\nchcles where the chief value of an office appears to be in the per\nquisites attached to the same. The most noxious illustration of th\nTammany principle, that to the victor belongs the spoils is found\nin the case of A. B. Gray, who was recently appointed receiver of\npublic moneys at Carson City. The office chair was hardly warmed\nby the atomic appointee than he appears to have added to his\nincome by taking unto himself the public advertising of the lanl\noffice which by rights belongs to some honest editor who is bent\non rendering a service to his district and helping develop his\nsection of the state. The Bonanza has no irons in the fire for,\nunder the orders of the interior department, no advertising from\nthe Democratic administration, is permitted to appear in a Republi\ncan publication, but it does not seem exactly right for an office\nholder, who exists by grace of his party and the favor of Senator\nPittman, should receive any pap from the government which\npays a princely salary for services rendered in connection with\nthe land office. However, Clay Tallman, land commissioner, under\ndate of May 1, 1918, in advertising the sale of Beatty townlots\nhas to travel all the way to Carson City to find a favorite on whom\nhe can bestow the price of party devotion. Are the Democratic\neditors of this state so dead to the necessity of protesting against\nthis system of adding to an officeholder\'s fat living when they\nhave to struggle along doing all the free government printing tha\nis tent over the desk with every mail. Grey does not bother himself\nwith printing any of these appeals for Red Cross, Liberty loans or\nwarfare stamps, but keeps right on grinding when the grist come\nto the mill accompanied by a fat check from the land office.

All elements\nof danger have been so carefully an\nticipated that the risk is reduced to\n(1) lowest minimum.\nVntil Hie troops and civilians pas\nsengers have reached the pier they\ndo not know the name of their ship.\nIt is only a number to them. On the\nregular troops ships It is difficult for\na civilian, unless he is engaged in\nvar work, to secure a passage. Those\nwho manage to do bo are subjected\nto rlo-e scrutiny, and their creden\ntials and luggage are closely exam\nined. Embarkation often begins several\ndays before the transport sallR. All\nItiHid byes have been said before the\ntroops start for the ship. No rela\ntive or friend may accompany them\nto the pier. This rule applies to the\nofficers as well as to the men.\nOnce aboard, there they remain, no\nshore communication being permitted.\nTills regulation Imposes no hardtihlp\nother titan Inactivity".

Telegrams or post\ncards advlBlng \'family and friends\nthat the writer has made the trip in\nBafety may be prepared In advance\nand left In charge of the authorities\nat the port of sailing. As soon as\nword is received by cable of the\nship\'s arrival on the other side, the\ntelegrams and cards are released to\nthe wires and malls, Not only Ib\nmuch time saved by this plan, but\nthe soldiers are spared the high cost\nof cabling from Kurope.\nWith the exception of the ship\'s\nexecutive and the officers in military\ncommand, no one aboard knows the\nTiour fixed for sailing, and this be\ncomes a \'favorite topic for speculation\nbmong the men. But finally the last\nsoldier has come up the gangplank\nand the last piece of freight has been\nstowed away. A busy little tug ap\npears alongside and begins to nose\nthe vessel like a terrier investigat\ning a greyhound.\nSuddenly there Is a blast from the\nship\'s whistle, and then are enacted\na few detallB of the familiar scene\nwhich before the war was witnessed\nwhenever a transatlantic liner left\nits pier. The comparison, however.\nIs extremely limited. The call of "All\nashore that are going ashore" affect\ntmly a few stevedores and perhaps\nan official or two, who move leisurly\norf.\nWhat excitement there Is la con\nfined to those ou the ship.

Orders have been\ngiven for the troops to go to their\nquarters, so that when the ship Is\nleaving harbor no uniform may be\nvisible to any prying eyes on shore.\nSlowly the big vessel Is coaxed by\nthe tug into the stream, and majesti\ncally she get sunder way. A few\ncivilian passengers, to the envy of\nOfficers and men, hang over the rails\nand watch the city\'s skyline fade\naway.\nSoon the port Is only a blur in a\nveil of mist. It is safe now for the\ntroops to appear. They rush out on\ndeck, boyishly eager for the sight\nstrange to many of the open sea. A\nglance Is cast toward the vague line\non the horizon that Is home.

Mrs. Campbell had\nrecently gone to Canada to say good\nbye to two brothers, who are soon\nleaving for the front, and therefore\nwas not with her husband during his\nilness. Mr. Campbell purchased the\nSpokane rooming house, which with\nthe Ricbmar, was under his manage\nment at the time of his death. He\nwas a member of the Knights of Co\nlumbus and the Elks\' lodge of Tono\npah. Mrs. Campbell was reached by\nwire.

The lights\nwere there, peals of laughter rose\nand blanded with music and the pat\nter of numerous feet told of the\npresence of men and women and the\nillumination plainly affirmed the sus\npicion that some new mining camp\nhad sprung up over night In the\nheart of the desert. The location,\nmidway between Tonopah and Gold\nfield, favored this assumption but,\nhad the birdman descended, he would\nhave discovered that he was among\nthe Eagles of southern Nevada who\nwere enjoying one of their annual\nfrolics.

The day was threaten\ning and the weather served to deter\nsome from going out early, but ns\nnoon approached and the sun shone\nout it was thought that the after\nnoon and evening would be free from\nthe interruption of inclement\nweather.

When\na black cat comes into her hut with\nthe storm It brings with it a sudden\nthought of terror, implanted in the\nminds of simple fo\'k through ancient\nlegends and superstitious belief.\nLater in the story, when Marcia is\nin America, a black cat is the fore\nrunner of the episode In which she\nkills her miserly husband In self de\nfense when he attempts to wrest\nfrom her the devil stone, which was\nfound after the storm when the\nblack cat first appeared in Marcia\'s\nlife. Has the black cat any signifi\ncant imjKirtance lev governing the\nevents of the story Those who are\nsuperstitious will say that it has.\nThose who Bcoff at superstition will\nlaugh at the possibility. You can\nJudge for yourself by seeing It at the\nButler tonight.
