ABOVE THE LAW\nThe charge has been made in the\npress opposed to the admininistra\ntion, that the anti-trcst bill now\npending in the senate puts labor\norganizations and farmers\' organiza\ntions above the law and sanctions\nviolence, coercion and intimidation.\nIn discussing this charge, Repre\nsentative Webb, chairman of the\nhouse judiciary committee, recently\nsaid:\n"There is not a provision in the\nanti-trust bill which can he tortur\ned into\'meaning that violence, coer\ncion, or intimidation are authorized\nor countenanced. The framers of\nthe Sherman law never intended to\nplace labor organization and farm\ners\' organizations under the ban of\nthat law. The existence of a labor\nor farmers\' union never has been\nunlawful and is not unlawful today,\nbut it is desired to place in the\nstatutory of the country a recogni\ntion of the rights of those organiza\ntions to exist and carry out their\nlawful purposes.\nAfter the original section 7 of\nthe unti-trust bill was drawn cer\ntain representatives of labor con\ntended that we should make the\nsection provide that the anti-trust\nlaws should not apply to labcr or\nganizations beyond the pale of the\nan?i-trust laws entirely, which nei\nther the president nor the member?\nof the committee would agree to.\nFinally, after ten days parleying\nwe agreed to add to what we al\nready had provided in the labor\nplank adopted in the Baltimore\ndemocratic convention, that such\norganzations, orders or associations\nor their members should not te\nheld illegal combinations in re\ns raint of tradfi under the anti-trust\nlawt This added nothing material,\nbut seemed a pretty gooJ com\npromise prooosition.\nThis does not give labor, farm\ners, or fraternal organizations any\nmore than they are entitled to\nunder the 1 vv today, nor any more\nthan the federal courts throughout\nthe co?ntry have held them entitled\nto. Thia provision, will protect\nthem from dissolution under the\nanti-trust laws Dut dors not pro\ntect them from penalties for vio\nlating the criminal laws of the\ncountry. We have only written in\nthis section, the concensus of the\njudgments of the best federal\ncourts.\nConsiderable furor, as if it* was\nrevolutionary and unusual, has\nbeen made over this section. There\nis nothing revolutionary or radical\nabout it. Boycotting is illegal to\nday in all the courts. The right to\nquit work is not denied any man.\nThe right to peaceably assemble\nand discuss grievances is a consti\ntutional right. Wlut is known as\nthe secondary boycott is not au\nthorized or legalized."\nLAND OF MILLIONAIRES\nThe outside world has but little\nconception of the great wealth of\nthe Republic of Mexico and it is\npretty broadly hinted that it is the\nmen who have been struggling to\ncontrol that wealth who have made\nall the e listing troubles for the\nMexican people, says the Clifton,\nArizona, Copper Ere.\nThere are bankers in Germany,\nFrance, Spain and England, into\nwhose coffers much of the wealth\nof Mexico has been steadily pouring\nfor the past two years. ? There are\nmines in Mexico that the New York\nFto?k exchange never heard of that\nhave yielded more than a million\ndollars each in the past fifty years.\nMore than a million dollars was\ntak?n out of one mine in Guana\njauto in twenty years. This single\nfirm of Hernandez, consistirg of\nthr^e brothers, who came puor boys\nto th? country from Spain, is said\nto be as wealthy as the Rockefeller\nfamily in this country.\nThere are more than 1,000\nfamilies in Mexico whose wealth\nruns from $10,000,001) to $50,000,\n000.\nWoolly Lamb.

The\nSociety of Automobile Engineers la\nnow trying to reduce tire slxe to about\n12. Probably the popular sizes\nwill number even lees than that. Anal\nly.

This com\npany recently concluded a detailed in\nvestigation of the tire troubles. Of\ntires returned to manufacturers it was\nfound, for. instance, that five times\nas many 34x4 tires were damaged in\nthe fabric as in the 36*4 V4 size, six\ntimes as many 32*3 % tires had fab\nrics break as 33*4, and the same com\nparison applies to 36*4 and 37x4 V4,\n| and 34x3% and 36x4.\n"In other words, where large alter\nnative tires are used, fabric damage\nis largely eliminated. What little\ndoes occur in the larger sizes results\ndirectly from undue-inflation or accW\ndent.\n"Tire companies are naturally ad\nvocating the use of larger tires wher\never possible, as a protection not only\nto themselves but to car owners as\nwell.

The Constellation, which was\none of the first ships of the American\nnavy, and whose name will probably\nbe linked forever with the British\nGuerriere, because of the hand-to-hand\ndeath grapple of the two ships, now\nlies off Newport, but there is a strong\nsentiment favorable to bringing her\nhere.\nThe Navy league claims no original\nity in the matter, and the statement\nquotes Rear Admiral Victor Blue, chief\nof the bureau of navigation, who in\nhis last annual report, submitted U>\nthe secretary of the navy, a state\nment as follows:\n"It is recommended that the frigate\nConstellation, now at the navy train\ning station, Newport, R.
