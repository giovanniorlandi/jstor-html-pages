The\nnumber of Its uses is increasing rap\nidly and as its efficency in various\nlines is becoming more and more\nwidely understood and appreciated\nhe demand is growing, thus opening\nup tremendous opportunities for com\npanies controlling high grade silica\ndeposits.\nSilica for commercial purposes has\nnot been found, until recently, In\nlarge deposits and free from organic\nmatter. There are several deposits\nof silica in the eastern states and\nCanada, but almost all of them, of\nany size, are In an Impure state be\ning contaminated by organic mat\nter and can be only made a market\nable commodity at a considerable ex\npense.
