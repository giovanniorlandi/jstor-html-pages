Critical \npedagogy in this context must also deal with a difficult issue to overcome cultural \ndifferences, understanding, and develop a convincing model of democracy, which will \ninclude the development of existing and marginalized groups and conflict between different \ncommunities and culture [2]. It's important noted that critical theory seeks to restore \nhumanized content and meaning of education is not for the introduction of capital values of \nindustrial and high technology, but above all, a radical democratization of education in \norder to achieve the goals of progressive educators, in particular, such as Dewey, Freud, \nIllich in education, research that will contribute to the development of personality \ncitizenship and community, social justice and strengthening democratic participation in all \nkinds of life. Over the past decade there has been persistent attempts to impose neoliberal \npolicies on education, the desire to reorganize the school under a business model \nimplementation rigidly standardized curriculum. primitive testing methods, distorting the \nmeaning and purpose of pedagogy. This neo-liberal program is catastrophic for the content \nof education and training and the critical theory of education in this context should be seen \nas a critique of neoliberal restructuring of education and in this sense it is necessary to \npropose an alternative concept and practice of education, training and social development \n[3]. Globalization and the technology revolution have be used for a radical restructuring of \neducation and support for members of a radical pedagogy training conditions so that they \ncan offer their models of pedagogy and reconstruction of education for its service to \ndemocracy and progressive social change. Although strictly necessary to criticize neoliberal \nmodel, it is also important at the same time offering them an alternative. Therefore, you \nmust be accompanied by a demand for new knowledge and restructuring education program \nof democratization.  \nThe modern concept of «critical social philosophy of education» examines the \nmodernization of social, economic and political development and the potential of \nanthropological-psychological structure of human values and normative dimension of \ncontemporary globalized society world reformation strategy in society, education and \nmanagement, globalization and their institutionalization processes and perspectives \nhumanization of education, administration, education [4,5]. Critical Theory of Education, \nwhich develops in recent years within the postmodern update traditionalist educational \nparadigm requires researchers a new view on the social structure of education, a special \nanalysis of the context of solving educational problems. It requires a deep analysis of the \nrelationship between teaching and administrative components of democratization. But it \nspecifies only the general ideological and methodological framework addressing issues of \ndemocratization of education, leaving unanswered questions about the specific terms of \nsuch decision. Changes in the interpretation of the democratic social order led to the need to \nfind mechanisms and conditions for the implementation of the idea of democracy in \neducational institutions, the need for new research and practical advice based on the current \nsystemic vision of education for school allocation as a key element of the system, the \ncontextual analysis of individual successful attempts of democratization. Thus, the research \nproblem in a generalized sense is to theoretically determine and verify the experience of \nsuch approaches to democratization of education that would overcome the abovementioned \ndifficulties and solve the problem of coherent implementation of the idea of democratic \neducation.  \n2 Research methodology \nIn current trends of social development with ever more general need arises the need \nsolving in theoretical and practical terms, the problem of civic institutional democratization, \n2\nE3S Web of Conferences 277, 06005 (2021)\nICEES 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202127706005\n", 'including systems management, and education and realize the vision of a democratic public \neducation and enlightenment.  \nModern management, philosophy and sociology of education, developmental \npsychology suggest that the mechanisms and conditions for the implementation of \npedagogical ideas are reflected not only in the formal organizational structures and training \nprograms. A key role in pedagogically meaningful social affairs educational institution \nplays a set of explicit and implicit factors – an informal organization of schools forming \nobjective (institutional) context of democratization of education. However, the existing \nstudies, this task is not fully resolved. Therefore it is important to answer the question of \nwhat institutional context can be given in school to become a condition of its conversion to \nan open democratic community? Significant severity of the theory and practice of \ndemocratic education is the fact that existing studies on democratization listed areas are \nconsidered on the basis of understanding of democracy, designed for advanced social \ninstitutions at the beginning of the century. Therefore, the implementation of the said idea \nrequires, first, clarify ideas about democracy under contemporary socio-cultural situation \nand, secondly, the development trends of transformation of education as a social institution \nof specific rights, exposing idea of democracy can be implemented. The solution of this \nproblem makes appeal as a social theory that clarifies the modern idea of democracy and \nthe theory of education. Contemporary social theory offers a new understanding of \ndemocracy (critical or pluralist model), different from the traditional liberal or \nasocinianism, the essence of which is to overcome the alienation of the individual from \nsociety and culture, diversity and globalization.  \n3 Results of the research \nAs social philosophy, philosophy of science, global studies, and management are \ndiscussed in «critical social philosophy of education» as the basis of institutional and \nideological foundations of civil process, the educational process is presented in this context \nas an object of management and socio-philosophical analysis. Therefore, researchers who \nbelong to this ideological school, analyze the main trends of research institutionalization of \ncivil society, education and training in context of global humanistic philosophical \nprinciples, values and management models and types / levels of government. The system of \nquality education, effective public education at various levels have to anticipate both and \neffective system of social management, guarantee the existence of which is in turn \ndeveloped institutionalized civil society, and the formation of which requires not only the \nrule of law as its premise, but a completely new concept of learning, based on the social \nmodel philosophy of education [6]. However, only a developed and stable democratic \nsystem of education and public education enables efficient formation of civil society, the \nrule of law is the foundation of a stable democratic government and authoritative power [7].  \nCritical theory management of education should be based on a critical theory of society, \nwhich is conceptually analyzes the features of actually existing capitalist societies and their \nrelations of domination and subordination (oppression), conflict and the prospects for \nprogressive social change and transformative practices that make projects more complete, \nfreer life and democratic society. Criticality theory means a way of seeing and \nunderstanding, building categories, making connections, reflection and participation in \npractice theory, theory of withdrawal of social practice. Critical Theory is interdisciplinary, \ninvolving analytical criticism arsenal of different academic science and transdisciplinary \ntheories of various branches of knowledge for making multicultural objective view of the \npresent and future society. Critical theory is a boundary crossing, interaction and mediation, \ncombining different aspects of social life in complex projects of normative historical \nthinking. Her metatheory so most models contain a holistic education that integrates a \nvariety of topics that are dialectical unity, not dividing the material in to knowledge.  \n3\nE3S Web of Conferences 277, 06005 (2021)\nICEES 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202127706005\n', "According to the critical theory of education in today's society there is thus a \nfundamental mismatch between education and life experience, expectations of the older \ngeneration regarding labor and new social conditions and previous organizational forms of \neconomy and culture, as opposed to the new digital and multimedia on based culture and \nfusion global economynt. \nThe concept dates back to the 1970's and 1980's in a socially-critical studies P. Freire, \nH.Marcuse, Ch.Reych, I.Illich, R.Prebisch, K.Leech, R.Lichtman, R.Jacoby and others. It \nalso uses some narobky G.Deleuze, F.Guattari, M.Foucault, J.Lacan. Methodological and \nanalytical principles in this area of research based on critical theory and social studies \nformed on the basis of the concept of «social deliberative», «social subsidiarity», Liberty \nreflex communitarianism, according to which the subject and the object is interacting \nfactors among the entire set of social practice at the institutional level, this stage of its \nhistorical development. interdisciplinary Now this trend is headed philosophers, political \nscientists, economists, cultural D.Kellner, I.Benjamin, R.Lichtman, R.Jacoby, P.Orban, \nD.Cooper, A.Jappe, A.Badiou, M. Debes, G.Miaret, S.Zhyzhek, R.Kurz, M.Bookchin, \nP.Cockshott, A.Cottrell, R.Danneman, R.Scholz, E.Lohoff and S.Miller, others. They seek \nto expand the existing understanding of the theory and practice of education and social \nphilosophy, management of the achievements and challenges of globalization processes, the \ninstitutionalization of civil society, their role for social life and social cognition in the \ncontext of education and social analysis of the phenomena of education, upbringing and \ntraining. Social philosophy, philosophy of science, global studies, and management are \ndiscussed in «social philosophy of education» as the basis of institutional and ideological \nfoundations of civil process, the educational process is presented in this context as an object \nof management and socio-philosophical analysis. In this concept the analysis of social, \nphilosophical and managerial aspects of the models and methodologies of modern \neducational philosophy and management educational process.  \nWhen using the term «critical theory» (eg, education) is generally understood \nmethodological developments of the Frankfurt School of Social Research, but the \nunderstanding of critical theory is broader than the version developed «Frankfurters». In the \ncontext of theorizing and reconstructing education for the modern era, it is necessary to \ninclude the tradition of critical pedagogy, post-structuralism and pragmatism. The last topic \ncovered critique of reason and of liberal democracy in particular the French version of \n«posttheory» But it is also necessary to consider the critical theory research on \nglobalization, society, education, gender, race and subjectivity have developed a wide range \nof theoretical entities in recent years. These topics can enrich critical pedagogy and help \nwith the project of democratization and reconstruction of education to ensure that the goals \nof social justice and progressive change can provide the pedagogy and practice of \neducation. Metateoretychne I use the term «critical theory» as a concept of opening this \nproject to show the critical dimension of theoretical aspirations and political dynamics that \nseek to link theory and practice. The concept of «criticality» is synoptic in a wide range of \nthemes and issues «critical» in ancient Greek verb meaning krinein, which means to \ndistinguish reason and judgment, and «theory» in the sense of the Greek noun \ncontemplation to which the way of seeing and contemplation. Of ancient Greek criticism is \nrooted in everyday life and is an example of Socratic practice study of social life, its \ninstitutions, values, and dominant ideas and his own thoughts and actions [8].  \nCriticism has become central to the project of the Enlightenment as a critique of power \nand legitimation of his intellectual and political positions. According to the Kantian sense \nof criticism, for example, want to question all the ideas of reason, morality, religion, \naesthetics, and other dominant ideas to see how they can be justified and institutionalized. \nKant criticism aimed at the autonomy of prejudice and unfounded ideas and demands \nrigorous reflection on their background and the major positions and arguments to support \n4\nE3S Web of Conferences 277, 06005 (2021)\nICEES 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202127706005\n", 'their position. Critical theory is also based on the Hegelian concept of criticism, criticism \nunilateral position (such as technophobia against technology) and development of a \ncomplex dialectical perspectives that reject and unsubstantiated, erroneous or oppressive \nfeatures of the item at the same time creating a positive and liberating aspects. Critical \ntheory takes the Hegelian concept by developing a coherent theory to try to understand the \ntotality of the industry, however, assuming that it is important to make associations and \nformulate conflict, breaking idealistic or reductive theories in general.  \nA critical theory of education also draws on Marxian critique, stressing the importance \nof critique of ideology and situating analysis of a topic like education within the dominant \nsocial relations and system of political economy. The Marxian project systematically \ncriticized the assumptions of an established hegemonic discipline, as in Marx’s critique of \npolitical economy, and constructed an alternative theory and practice to overcome the \nlimitations and oppressive features of established institutions and systems of production. \nMarxian critique involves radical examination of existing ideologies and practices of \neducation and the need for pedagogical and social transformation to free individuals from \nthe fetters of consumer capitalism and to help make possible a free, more democratic and \nhuman culture and society. Marxian theorists like Antonio Gramsci criticized the ways that \nItalian education and culture reproduced ideologies of the bourgeoisie and then fascism and \ncalled for a counterhegemonic cultural project that would encompass alternative institutions \nfrom schooling to theater to journalism to help construct a socialist and democratic society. \nIn our time, as Charles Reitz has demonstrated, Herbert Marcuse carried out sustained \ncriticisms of the existing system of education as a mode of reproducing the existing system \nof domination and oppression and called for counter-institutions and pedagogies to promote \ndemocratic social transformation and the full development of individuals. \nBuilding on this tradition in the critical spirit of Hegelian philosophy, and classical \nphilosophy of education can help in the project of reconstruction and democratization of \neducation and society, but some idealist, elitist and repressive elements of classical and \nmodern pedagogy must be rejected. Critical Theory of Education provides a normative \ndimension theory as practice building life and educational alternatives available. \nDevelopment of this educational model applies regulatory developments classical \nphilosophy of education from the Greeks through John Dewey and critics of classical \nwestern education such as Ivan Illich [9,10] and Paulo Freire [11–13]. In Greek philosophy \nmeans love of wisdom (philo-Sophia) and the practice of philosophy – a Paideia \n(formation) and development of man and citizen. In the early twentieth century, John \nDewey, headed direction, which has developed the most stable premise of progressive \neducation, relationship education and democracy. Dewey argued that there can be no \ndemocratic society without a democratic education that everyone should have access to \neducation and that education is the key to democracy, and thus social welfare. Dewey was \nan advocate of a strong, egalitarian and participatory democracy, where everyone takes part \nin social and political life. For Dewey, education is the key to working democracy, so as to \nreasonably participate in public and political life, to be informed and educated to be able to \nbe of high quality and competent member of the national democratic life. \n \n4 Conclusions \n The call for democratic reconstruction of education should contribute to the \ndevelopment of the acquisition and use of knowledge and thought of as a response to \nemerging technologies and trends in globalization. In particular, be aware that nowadays \nsome unfair terms communities, individuals are privileged in having access to technology, a \nhigh-tech skills and cultural capital than the less privileged communities. One way to \novercome this abyss of a whole complex of new classes of inequalities, gender, race, \n5\nE3S Web of Conferences 277, 06005 (2021)\nICEES 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202127706005\n', 'education is restructuring so that all students have access to new technologies and new \nknowledge in the system democratized education and training process. Hegelian dialectics \ncan help the efficiency of the relationship between students and teachers today in a situation \nwhere there is a lack of cultural, social experience as well as the specific subjectivity \nbetween groups, nations and generations. Teachers, students, and citizens must recognize \nthis potential conflict and consolidate work to overcome these conflicts, making these \nactions more productive. Overall, the democratization of education can be enhanced in part \nby increasing elaboration and interactive forms of education, including such as distance \neducation, the development of collective educational websites, online discussions and a \nscientific online community, shared internet research projects. But the restructuring of \neducation also requires targeted public, values education, literacy cultivation. For teaching \nand learning books and printed materials based on multimedia and Internet materials should \nbe considered as an additional, rather than as the primary means of democratization of \neducation.  \nIn addition, the critical social and philosophical theory of education will involve \nmerging class-based Socratic discussions of research projects that will combine oral, \nwritten, multimedia and cultural forms of the learning process, not favoring any of them. \nSome educators still insist that direct dialogue in the classroom / class is the alpha and \nomega of quality education, but seeing for classroom dialogic extremely productive, do not \nneed to fall into a false fetysh any of the training shapes. This also applies to new media \nmodels of education. Rather, the task is to build in quality development in all experimental \nand more all these aspects of the educational process on civil-social restructuring and \ndemocratization of education. Consequently, the reconstruction of education on the grounds \nthat the socio-economic, cultural and material conditions of life and labor vary with the \nsocial development of the mind is the answer to the great transformation of our time. \nCritical Philosophy of Education is committed to providing a radical critique of existing \neducation in so-called Western models of democracy, creating a progressive alternative \nmodels.  \nIn this context, the proposed integrative metatheory that is Based on classical and \ncontemporary sources, concepts, committed to a comprehensive understanding of the \nphenomenon and the reconstruction of education. One of the main objectives in the \ndemocratization of education today, therefore, is to engage education for the restructuring \nand democratization of society and reflect the changes in the conditions of life and thinking, \nexperience and transformation of subjectivity in the context of the technological revolution \nand globalization. It involves using technology to democratic reconstruction of education \nand the promotion of progressive social and political change without the help of the \nneoliberal model values and capital social order.  \nBased on this premise, in the long run it allows to develop the philosophy of education \nto develop a more inclusive vision of philosophical education to speak directly to issues of \ndemocratization and changing social relations in the direction of equality and social justice. \nAs social circumstances are constantly changing, critical theory of education must be \nradically addressed to historicism, trying to reconstruct education and its institutions as \nsocial development conditions and create educational alternatives in terms of needs, \nproblems and opportunities of specific groups of people in specific situations. However, in \nterms of philosophical and normative understanding and social criticism also necessary to \nuse an active effort on the reconstruction of education and society, the social vision of what \neducation and life can be and what their specific limitations in existing societies.  \nThus, social and philosophical critical theory of education involves the study of \neducation in a public context for understanding how the radicalization of democratic \neducation can help to significantly change society and its essence. \n \n6\nE3S Web of Conferences 277, 06005 (2021)\nICEES 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202127706005\n', 'References \n1.
