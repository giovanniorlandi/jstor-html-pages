Tur, key and Bulearia were as much a, Par of the Pan-Germanic empire as I, fney are today. They entered the|, war presumably on the day assign, ed and ordered by Berlin., Thanks to years of preparation,, tha first rush of the Jierman mili, tary machine carried i* far into en, emr territory. Enemy populations, were promptly enslaved. Little na, tions were overrun and their people, driven into the slave prangs and put, to work. Here is a sample of the, meats taken to secure labor.

Thus, untold thousands of men were re, leased from industry for military, service. Many enslaved men even, b«ln£ lorcetl into the ranks.

Yes, sir, to read the Seward Gateway, rou\'d think it was the New York, 5un of Alaska. On February 10, t said:, "The Gateway yesterday after, noon and the Post this morning, ivere the only publications In Al, iska receiving press dispatcihes dur, ing the past 24 hours. The mo, ment it was anriounced the cable, svas broken between Sitka and Se, attle a wire was rushed to the As, sociated Press in Seattle to send, Dress day and night regardless of, cost.

The Gateway re-sent its, press to other newspapers so they, could bulletin it.", Not wishing to be presumptious,, The Alaskan could tell our contem, porary town of "hope" of several, newspapers which received presi, during: three 24 hours, but of coiysi, these newspapers were in Southeast, em Alaska, and may not count lr, the Gateway\'s eyes. When a per, son puts a dime close enough to hie, eve, that dime is the world, so we, judce that to be the case with the, Gateway.

The shippinj, space required by corn is much, greater than that taken by* fwheat, 3nd we haven\'t that spac« tc, sr>arr. Th-e heavy percentage ol, f3l in cornmeal makes it spoil mucl, more rapidly than wheat, both in, the raw meal and in the bakedl pro, duct. Europeans know little about, cr.rntneal produces. They have, few or no facilities for grinding it,, Habit is strong upon the peoples of, the eld world. They do uot take, readi\'y to innovations, ia corn, meal or anything else.

You saw women ap, proach with a bundle that had been, purchased by the sale of the last, of their household effects.

In his official summary of tbe, negotatlons which he carried on he, says:, "I then discussed In detail with the, under secretary of state for foreign af, fairs the unfortunate Impression which, this decision would make abroad, re, minding him that the measures were, in principle contrary to the assurances, given to the ambassador by the chan, cellor at general headquarters last, spring and dwelling on the effect which, the policy might have on Fugland\'s at, titude towards relief work in Belgium., I sold I understood that tlie measures, hud beeu promulgated solely by the, military government In Belgium and, that I thought the matter ought at, least to he brought to the chancellor\'s, personal attention In the light of the, consequences which the new policy, would entail.

Further, more, the government of the United, States is convinced that the efTect of, this policy If pursued will In all prob, ability be fatal to the Belgian relief, work, so humanely planned so suc, cessfully carried out, a result which, would be generally deplored and, which.

F., Enevoldsen in England had me, listed on the same, as I was ab, sent at the time on fatigue leave, and he went on reputation of of, ficeis given by returned soldiera, \'o him, and we hit the right spot, all right. Those men had seen ser, vice, and sure enough we bit the, *ery company of the battalion, that\'s next to Fritz an the time,, and sure enough we suffered lessv, casualties by far than companies of, other battalions, same troops, com, ing un behind., The colonel of the company in, conjunction with our officers has, had gall enough to connect their, steel with Fritz\'s, take his officer\'s, quarters, and loot their comforts,, something we are stictly opposed to, unless we get a share ourselves., However as we had more than w, could pack and bad to make Yukon, caches we will overlook it for this, \'line. War, however, is kind of two, 6ided, one day you chase Fritz, next, day he comes back at you, but, never as far as we went, and where, this used to be tbe game of a few, hundred yards, we go by miles now.., This reminds me that in one of, Fritz\'s heaviest offensives we were, r\'ght behind the infantry, whieih is, our olace of course, only we were, rofug- tbe other way. Some of the, 3rd company, 6tb battalion in, conjunction, with some snipers, less, than 50 in all, lield off a thousand, Germans till tbe Irish Guard came, u» on the other side of the same, v\'il?ge. Bome imperial Labor com, Ipatifs did the same, till the, Welsh guard came up; their officers, an* men received medals for brav, ery; our officers, which, were over, an bcur behind all others in re, treat. and yho covered their men,, got no mention whatever, the only, cnes who really; deserved it, and, why? Because no Imperial Staff, officer was there at the time. But, after the war these chronicles will, adjust themselves and-credit will be, given where it is due. Canadian, soldiers are/ far too fair minded not, to see justice done., What really started me to write, this letter was an article I saw in, the Daily Province, Vancouver, B.., C., how the Germans kand Austrians, through the electorate tried to, send *helr own members to the, House irrespective of party. This, seems to us here at the front to he, rank treason. Enemy aliens, al, though naturalized, should be dis, franchised for years, their business, and Incomes controlled, labor com, mandeered at government fixed, rate*. Rneyoidgen tells an© of a (, case where one Austrian, known, in, Juneou as Joe, Burnamed Vinter, \'isoltz, since the outbreak of the, wir not only contributed to the, Datriotic fund but went up on the, Pelly and gave his service® free of, charge to Jo© Cole, then a trader, taere, «nd later when, lie sold out to, Tom Bee, and although he was not, naturalized, in his presence express, ed a deep hatred of the Prussian, militarism and pitied his own peo, ple for having become thein allies., Joe f»s mining on Bonanza and has, prooeitv in Canada and must have, about $20,000 in a JDwson bank. He, appreciated what the country had, done for him, and I believe produc, ers like him should get a fair j, deal as they are working for our j, benefit. But at politics, draw a i, sharp line, and if an internment law, is passed, then treat all enemy, alien* as the Germans do us., Cur prisoners are fed as well as, we are, but outside of absolutely, needed exercise, do not do any real, work. No work, no eat, should, be oui motto. It makes some of us, itch to get Oven with them., 1 know The Alaskan is read as, much on the Canadian side as on, the American, but I must mention,, this fact, that we have been with., th~ American R. J\'s. They are a, fine body of boys, and when they, got a chancethey bolted for the, troncnes and had great sport shoot, inr Fritz\'s; but as they went, without orders, we heard they were, to be court martialed. We do not, -hink that such valor will be very, heavily punished.
