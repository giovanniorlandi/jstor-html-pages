MUST FEED\nALL THE ALLIES\nSecretary Houston Says Task is\nPolitical and Military\nNecessity.\nEXPLAINS THE CONTROL BILLS\nPresident to Have Power to Seize\nor Force Sale of Hoards, Close\nExchanges and Stop Spec\nulation.\nWashington, June 11. —The secretary\nof agriculture, D. F. Houston, issued\nthe following statement:\nCo-operating as we are with the\nnations of Europe in the war against\nthe central powers, the task of main\ntaining the subsistence of the allies\nis at once a political and moral obli\ngation and a military necessity. The\nwheat crop of practically the entire\nworld has suffered serious reduction\nduring the last year, and the prospects\nof the coming year promise little or no\nincrease in the production of this es\nsential cereal.\nTwo Courses Are Open.\nOne of two courses lies open to our\ngovernment. The first is to continue\nto permit unhampered the abnormal\noperations of trade* because of the\nneeds of the allies for foodstuffs from\nthis country. The send plan consists\nin the regulation or control of our\nfoodstuffs to the double end of main\ntenance of the subsistence of the al\nlies and the protection of the food\nneeds and commercial interests of our\nown people.\nTwo bills now pending in congress\nprovide for systematic development\nof our productive forces and an ade\nquate control of distribution and con\nsumption to the end of conserving\nfor ourselves and for rhe allies the\nfoodstuffs provided through the stim\nulation of agriculture.\nThe two bills, known as the “food\nproduction bill” and the “food-con\ntrol bill,” are designed to place in the\nhands of the administration emer\ngency powers and funds adequate to\naccomplish the necessary ends.\nIncrease Production.\nThe bill also provides for the nor\nmal activities of the department with\na view further to stimulate the pro\nduction and to conserve the supply of\nfoodstuffs.\nThe bill is framed as a war meas\nure. It authorizes the secretary of\nagriculture to make a survey of the\nfood supply of the nation, in order to\nsecure full and accurate information\nregarding its quantity, location and\nownership, as well as knowledge of\nthe instrumentalities or agencies that\nown, control, manufacture and dis\ntribute food products.\nAll this work, it is contemplated, can\nbe done for SS(JO,O(X) or SOOO,OOO.\nPower to Seize Seeds.\nPower also is given to requisition\nsuch seeds and to fix a reasonable\nprice to be paid for them by the gov\nernment, such price to be subject to\nreview by the courts.\nIt Is proposed to piftec at least one\ncounty agent in eevry rural county,\nand also further to develop the ex\ntension work for women.\nThe food control bill aims to facili\ntate and clear the channels of distribu\ntion, prevent hoarding, assure fair\nprices, restrain injurious speculation,\nprohibit evil practices on exchanges,\nprotect the public against corners and\nextortion and reduce waste. It deals\nwyth foods, feeds, shoes, clothing, fuel\n: amf articles required for their produc\ntion.\nIt confers, for the duration of the\nwar, -wide powers upon the president,\nto be exercised only after he has found\nthat a state of affairs warranting ac\ntion exists.\nWould Stop Hoarding.\nAuthority is given to license and\nregulate any business of manufacture,\n.storage and distribution of foods, food\nmaterials or feeds, whenever the pres\nident deems it essential to prevent un\neconomical manufacture or inequitable\ndistribution. Licenses also may be re\nquired to put hoarded stocks on the\nmarket and to refrain from unfair\npractices and prices.\nThe president is authorized to pre\nsent spoilage, to direct the disposition\n•of food which is going out of condition,\n,as well as to direct the market move\nment of perishable products with a\n'view to prevent gluts or to effect equit\nable apportionments.\nAnother section of the bill gives the\npresident authority (o procure neces\nsaries by purchase or otherwise, to\nstore them and to dispose of them at\ncost, and also to requisition and op\nerate any factory, mine or other plant\nin which food or fuel may be pro\nduced or mined. The purpose is to\n• enable the president to break unrea\nsonable prices and to eliminate injuri\n■ ous speculation.\nExchanges Are Included.\nPower also is given to the presi\ndent to regulate and, if need be, to\nclose exchanges which deal In neces\nsaries in order to eliminate evil prac-\nTHE WATERTOWN NEWS\ntices. ,\nIn case of extreme emergency. In or\nder to break corners or to prevent ex\ntortion, the president may hscertaln\nand prescribe the highest price at\nwhich it is reasonable to deal in any\nparticular necessaries. 4lf such a\nprice be fixed, it will thereafter be un\nlawful for anybody, except one dealing\nwith products of land cultivated by\nhim, to sell at a higher price.\nSPURN GERMAN - PEACE\nRussians Denounce Foes' At\ntempt to Bait Slav Army.\nRevolutionaries at Kronstadt Demand\nFormer Czar Be Placed\non Trial.\nPetrograd, June 11. —The council of\nsoldiers and workmen has made pub\nlic the fact that the German com\nmander in chief on the eastern front\nsent a wireless message inviting the\nRussian armies to a separate armistice\nand proposing that they enter into se\ncret pourparlers with the German lead\ners.

The bill probably will not\nbe completed until lute this week.\nThe new automobile schedule im\nposes on owners of pleasure motors a\nminimum tax of $5, with graduation\nupward based virtually at 1 per cent\nupon the original selling price. A re\nduction allowance is made upon used\ncars ranging up to 50 per cent.\nThe cabaret tax section, which the\ncommittee estimates would raise be\ntween $2,000,000 and $3,000,000, reads:\n“A tax of 1 cent shall be collected\nfor each 10 cents or fraction thereof\npaid for admission to any public per\nformance for profit at any cabaret or\nother similar entertainment to which\nthe charge for admission is wholly or\nin part included in the price paid for\nrefreshments, service, or merchandise;\nthe amount paid for such admission to\nbe computed under rules prescribed by\nthe commissioner of internal revenue\nwith the approval of the secretary of\nthe treasury, such tax to be paid by\nthe person paying for such refresh\nment, service or merchandise.”\nTaxation of candy was eliminated at\nthe suggestion of Senator Williams,\nwho pointed out that sugar and cocoa\ntaxes already agreed upon would cover\nthe principal ingredients of confection\nery.\nOn the question of taxing publishers\nthere is a particularly wide disagree\nment. None would predict the ulti\nmate outcome, except to say that some\nform of taxation is certain. Senator\nLa Follette proposed, in lieu of taxing\nadvertising receipts or raising postage\nrates, a direct tax of 5, 10 or even 20\nper cent upon publishers’ net incomes.\nTAKE GERMANS BY SURPRISE\nParis Says French Inflicted Heavy\nLosses at Two Places.\nParis, June 11. —The French made\na surprise attack on the left bank of\nhte Moselle, near the eastern end of\nthe front. The war olllce announces\nthat serious losses were inflicted near\nCraonne and Chevreux. The statement\nfollows:\n“Violent artillery actions occurred\nlast night at various points on the\nfront, especially in the vicinity of\nCraonne and Chevreux. German\nreconnoitering parties attempted to\napproach our lines near the Hurte\nhise monument, northeast of Prunay\nand on both banks of the Meuse at\nDead Man Hill and in Saurieres wood.\nThese efforts were without result.\n“We carried out a surprise attack\nin the left hank of the Meuse, in\nthe region of the Thiaucourt rail\nroad. Our detachments penetrated a\nGerman trench at several points and\ninflicted serious losses on the enemy.\nThey destroyed shelters and brought\nback a score of prisoners.”\n42 DEAD IN SALVADOR QUAKE\nEighty Out of Every Hundred Houses\nDestroyed in Capital.\nLa Lihertad, Salvador, June 11. —In\nthe towns of Armenia and Quosalte\npeque, near San Salvador, 40 persons\nwere killed and 100 were injured as\nthe result of the earthquake, which\nwas the most severe and most disas\ntrous felt in Salvador since 1873.\nEighty out of every 100 houses in San\nSalvador were razed and the entire\nbusiness section was destroyed by fire.\nThere are no authentic reports as to\nthe number of casualties in rhe capital.\nThe fire in San Salvador could not be\nquenched because the water supply\nsystem had been destroyed. There\nhave been no disorders.\nWATERTOWN, WISCONSIN^.AIONDAY, JUNE 11, 1917.\nWILSON BARES I\nPERIL TO U. S.\nDeclares Grave Danger Faces\nAmerica Unless We Defeat\nGermany.\nRUSSIA GIVEN WAR AIMS\nDemands Change in Pre-War Status\nQuo to Conform With Human\nRights—Opposes Indemnities\nExcept as Reparation.\nWashington, June 11. —In his note to\nRussia the president said that the\nwar had begun to turn against Ger\nmany. In a parenthetical note In the\ndocument It Is estimated that Germany\n“very possibly might be victorious.”\nPictures Fury of Victorious Germany.\nThis startling statement is taken\nfrom the following comment:\n“To anyone who will reflect upon\nthe subject it will soon appear to be\npreposterous folly that we ‘go it alone’\nagainst Germany and to fail to give\nevery possible aid to her original ene\nmies. Obviously, unless we send muni\ntions, troops, submarine chasers, etc.,\nto France, England and possibly Rus\nsia, since the German high fleet does\nnot at present come out, the war for us\nwill mean little more than calling\nnames across the Atlantic —until the\nEuropean war is ended, and then, if\nGermany has a pound of strength left,\n‘and very possibly site might be vic\ntorious,’ she cun vent on us all her\nhate and fury and exact from us the\nindemnities site cannot wring from a\nbankrupt Europe. So obvious is the\nmilitary necessity of giving every pos\nsible help to the present enemies of\nGermany that those who try to thwart\nthis are almost open to the very grave\ncriminal charge of giving aid and com\nfort to the enemies of the United\nStates.\n“A Prussianized Germany, triumph\nant in Europe and dominant on the\nseas, would find its occasion to strike\ndown America in its Isolation and\nmake of us the overseas tributary of a\nnew Roman empire. There can be no\nquestion that the future of democracy\nand of independent national life is\nhanging in the balance in this strug\ngle.”\nThe president’s communication was\ndelivered to the Russian government\nby Ambassador Francis at Petrugrad.\nIt is in part as follows:\n“In view of the approaching visit of\nthe American delegation to Russia to\nexpress the deep friendship of the\nAmerican people for the people of Rus\nsia and to discuss the best and most\npractical means of co-operation be\ntween the two people in carrying the\npresent struggle for the freedom of\nnil peoples to a successful consumma\ntion, it seems opportune and appropri\nate that I should state again in the\nlight of this new partnership the ob\njects the United States has had in\nmind in entering the \\^ar.\nGerman Plots for Peace.\n“The war has begun to go against\nGermany, and in their desperate desire\nto escape the inevitable ultimate de\nfeat, those who are In authority in\nGermany are using every possible in\nstrumentality, are making use even of\nthe influence of groups and parties\namong their own subjects, to whom\nthey have never been just or fair or\neven tolerant, to promote a propa\nganda on both sides of the sea which\nwill preserve for them their influence\nat home and their pow ? er abroad, to the\nundoing of the very men they are\nusing.\n“The position of America in .this war\nis so clearly avowed that no man can\nbe excused for mistaking it. America\nseeks no material profit of aggrandize\nment of any kind. She is fighting for\nno advantage or selfish object of her\nown, but for the liberation of peoples\neverywhere from the aggression of\nautocratic force.\nTrick in Berlin Offers.\n“The ruling classes in Germany have\nbegun of late to profess a like liberal\nity and justice of purpose, but only to\npreserve the power they have set up in\nGermany and the selfish advantages\nwhich they have wrongly gained for\nthemselves and their private projects\nof power all the way from Berlin to\nBagdad and beyond.\n“Government after government has.\nby their influence, without open con\nquest of its territory, been linked to\ngether in a net of intrigue directed\nagainst nothing less than the peace and\nliberty of the world. The meshes of\nthat intrigue must be broken.\n“Of course, the imperial German gov\nernment and those whom it is using for\ntheir own undoing are seeking to ob\ntain pledges that the war will end in\nthe restoration of the status quo ante.\n“No territory must change hands ex\ncept for the purpose of securing those\nwho inhabit it a fair chance of life\nand liberty. Np indemnities must be\nInsisted on except those that consti\ntute payment for manifest wrongs\ndone. No readjustments of power\nmust be made except such as will tend\nto secure the future peace of the world\nand the future welfare and happiness\nof its peoples.”\nPERSHING'S STAFF IN FRANCE\nAmerican Officers Begin Work of Or\nganizing Bases for Army.\nBoulogne-Sur-Mer, France, June 11.\n—A number of officers of Maj.

Clark, pastor of the Chris\ntian church here, was arrested as a\nGerman sympathizer as he stepped\nfrom his pulpit at the conclusion of the\nmorning service Sunday.\nOnly through the efforts of the offi\ncer who made the arrest was the white\nhaired clergyman saved from possible\ninjury at the hands of the crowd.\nThe minister faced the mob from the\nsteps of the church. He declared lie\nwas loyal to the United States and\nthat he would be willing to carry a gun\nfor ins country.\nHis words were answered only by\nhisses from the crowd and the cries\n“Drag him out!” grew louder. Then it\nwas that the veteran minister saluted\nthe Stars and Stripes, which a member\nof the mob brought before him, several\ntimes. The action appeased the crowd\nand it dispersed. Rev.

He may\nhold dogmas, he may hold them pas\nsionately ; and he may know that oth\ners hold them but coldly, or hold them\ndifferently, or hold them not at all.\nWell, if he has the gift of reading,\nthese others will be full of meat for\nhim. They will see the other side of\npropositions and the other side of vir\ntues. He need not change his dogma\nfor that, he may change his reading\nof that dogma, and he must supple\nment and correct his deductions from\nit. A human truth, which is always\nvery much a lie, hides as much of life\nas it displays. It is men who hold\nanother truth, or as it seems to us,\nperhaps, a dangerous lie, who can ex\ntend our restricted field of knowledge,\nand rouse our drowsy consciences.\nSomething that seems quite new, or\nthat seems insolently false or danger\nous, is the test of a reader. If he\ntries to see what it means, what truth\nexcuses it. he has the gift, and let\nhim read. If he is hurt or offended,\nor exclaims upon his author’s folly,\nhe had better take to the daily pa\npers ; he will never be a reader. —Rob-\nert Louis Stevenson.\nBALFOUR BACK HOME AGAIN\nBritish Foreign Minister Pleasod With\nVisit to U.

It is true that almost any\none can handle a snake —if he or she\nso desires —the trick being in know\ning how to pick up the reptile and\nnot making any quick moves when the\ncritter squirms. Just the same, the\nmajority of us are willing to con\ncede the argument, and let the other\nfellow experiment with the snake in\nquestion. It remains, however, for N.\nB. Luther, press agent for Evans car\nnival shows, which will be in Water\ntown all next week, to spring the lat\nest in snake stories. With the car\nnival company is a young lady, slight\nof form and weighing about 120\npounds, who handles snakes as most\ngirls do a pet doggie. Among her col\nlection of animated garden hose is a\npython of foreign extraction about\nfourteen feet long, and if you tell the\nyoung lady that her pet has no brains\nin his flat head, you are in bad right\naway.\nSeveral times during the season,\nthe big snake has slipped out of his\nbox, and headed straight for the\nsleeping apaitments of his trainer,\ncrawled into bed, and snuggled up\ncozily. There are at least always two\nothers sleeping in the tent, but the\npython always finds the right person\nand never mistakes the tent. “So\nfar,” says Mr. Luther, “the snake has\nnot learned to play a Jew’s harp or\ndance the ‘hootch,’ but there are\nstrong indications that it will learn\nto do so in time.”\n-o—\n-“ There are still some persons left\nin this country who believe in\nspooks,” remarked the portrait agent\nin the hotel lobby the other day. “I\nremember a case the year before last\nthat made me smile, but as the smile\nwas to my advantage 1 let it go at\nthat. One of our agents, picked up in\nthe back country a picture of an o/hl\ngentleman whom his widow wished to\nhave enlarged to hang in the parlor\nover the hair-cloth sofa. The picture\nwas an old ‘tin-type’ and the old gent\nhad sat for it with his hat on. Wash\ning to bring the picture down to date\nand civilization as much as possible,\nthe widow asked if there was any way\nthat the hat could be removed, and\nthe old gentleman be made to look\nlike he was tame. I replied that this\ncould be accomplished, and took the\npicture and got busy with my brush\nand some chemicals. I succeeded in\nremoving the old gent’s lid, and fak\ning a nice part in his hair, and the\nnext morning took the picture out and\nshowed it to the widow. She was\npleased with Hiram’s civilized appear\nance. and I packed the picture up\nvith others and sent it into the stu\ndio for enlargement. But something\n)i other was the matter with my\nchemicals, and when the picture ar\ni ived at the studio, all traces of my\nwork had disappeared, and the v old\n\'oy appeared with his hat on as be\n.ore I had doctored it. Of course, the\nworkmen at the studio knew nothing\nabout my idea, and went ahead and\nturned out an enlarged print with the\nhat on—the same as the original.\nWhen I received the picture and the\noriginal back for delivery, I took the\ntwo out to the old lady prepared for\nan argument. But fate had been to\nwork for me, and the moment that I\npulled the original picture out, the\nold lady threw up her hands.\n“How did you get that back on?”\nshe exclaimed.\nRight there I got a hunch, “I never\nput it back,” I said, with my most\nimpressive tone. “It came back of\nits own accord for some unaccount\nable reason. You see, madam—”\nBut she interrupted me before I had\na chance to queer myself by making\na break to square things. “Poor dear\nHiram, she sobbed. “ He did not want\nhis picture to hang up without his hat\non. The spirits did it, that’s what they\ndid. I know it, I know it. Poor Hi.” I\ntook my cue right there and admitted\nthat things looked very convincing,\nand the old lady get down the old\n->ock and counted out the price with\nout a murmur.\nAsks Police to Find Wife.\nA.

The point to be observed is\nnot to create back pressure which will\nmaterially decrease the power of the\nengine. An effective way to muffle\nthe engine in question would be to\nexhaust into a buried expansion cham\nber which is connected to the outside.\nfa\n[I O UT I.MT\nCovgmL S*\nr.v TV*.*.

With\nthis arrangement the chamber would\nnot need to be so deep and would not\nbe so effective because of the long pipe\nfrom the engine.

Bran Bread.—\nSe tWO CU P fuls\nclean bran, one\nA° ur - oue\ncll P^ butter\nmilk, one-half cup\nful of molasses or\nbrown sugar, one teaspoonful each of\nsoda and salt. Mix well and bake in\nmoderate oven one and a quarter\nhours.\nAnother good bran bread: Take two\ncupfuls of bran, two cupfuls of flour,\ntwo cupfuls of sour milk, one cupful\nof brown sugar, one cupful of raisins,\none teaspoonful of soda, and one-half\nteaspoonful of salt. After sifting the\nflour into a basin, add the bran and\nother dry ingredients. Mix the soda\nwith the sour milk and pour this into\nthe dry ingredients, turn when well\nblended into a well-greased pan and\nbake in a hot oven one hour.\nFruit Bran Muffins.— Take two table\nspoonfuls of molasses, one pint of milk,\none cupful of bran, one-fourth of a\ncupful of walnut meats, one cupful of\nentire wheat flour, one teaspoonful of\nsalt, three teaspoonfuls of baking\npowder and one-half cupful of raisins.\nMix the molasses, bran, milk, flour,\nsalt and baking powder, nut meats and\nraisins cut in pieces. Bake in a hot\noven in muffin tins for 30 minutes.\nBran Orangeade. —Take a fourth of\na cupful of bran and cover with two\ncupfuls of cold water; let it stand over\nnight, Strain, chill and add the juice\nof an orange and serve.\nBran Gems. —Take a cupful each of\nbran and graham flour, add seven\neights of a cup of milk, one teaspoon\nful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar,\nthree teaspoonfuls of baking powder\nand four tahlespoonfuls of melted but\nter. Mix the bran and other dry in\ngredients together, add the melted but\nter, turn into buttered muffin pans and\nbake in a hot oven 20 io 30 minutes.\nBran Biscuit. —Take a half cupful\neach of bran and flour, a teaspoonful\nof baking powder, one teaspoonful of\nmelted butter, a little salt and mix to\nmake a dough to roll.

A natu\nral product, it can be used in any\nquantity without danger of injury to\nthe soil. Experiments have shown\nthat two tons of limestone are as effi\ncient as one ton of quicklime, provid\ned the former is finely ground. Lime\nstone is considered finely ground when\nS?o per cent of it will pass through a\nsieve having 100 meshes to the inch.\nWhen two tons of limestone can be\npurchased and spread on the soil at\nan equal or less cost than one ton of\nquicklime or 2,650 pounds of hydrated\nlime, the limestone should be used.\nLimestone siftings sometimes can be\nsecured. Although rather coarse,\nthere is enough fine material present\nto justify their use, provided they can\nbe purchased at a price which will\nmake it practical to use four or five\ntons per acre.\nTrue Americanism.\nThe Americanism of a man is not al\nways proved by what he says. It is\nproved by what he thinks, and his gen\neral attitude toward government. The\nflag stands for freedom and self-gov\nernment, the supremacy of the civil\nover the military authority, and indi\nvidual rights. In this country, as\nlong as it continues to be American,\nthe state will be the servant, and not\nthe master of the people.\nPASSING OF THE INDIAN\nTEN-IN-ONE\nBILLY WARREN WONDERS\nFERRIS WHEEL\nTRIP TO MARS\nSILODOME\n20 CARLOADS—ORANGE\nSPECIAL\'\n*♦* *** *♦* *v* *♦* *’♦\'* *s* *♦*■%■* ♦♦♦ *s♦ ♦♦♦♦♦* *♦* ♦s* *1\nJ> ♦j*.\n| Correspondence I\n**s*s*"*s**s*"*s**s* *s**ss* *J* *J* J* J J* J> tjnf\nFarmington.\nMrs. Edwin Alberts of Johnson\nCreek spent a few days last week at\nthe home of her parents.\nIrving and Edward Weber of Wa\ntertown were visitors at the home of\nC.

MOORE SPEAKS\nTO GARDEN CLUB\nAt a meeting of the Garden club in\nthe public library Friday evening the\nphase of vegetable gardening in con\njunction with preservation and can\nning of foods was discussed by Prof.\nJ. Moore, University of Wisconsin,\nand Miss Cory Smith, Fort Atkinson,\nmember of the County Council of De\nfense. The Rev. N. Carter Daniell in\ntroduced the speakers.\n“Farming is a job any one can do,”\nstated Prof. Moore. “There are a lot\nof things to learn,” he continued. The\nprofessor then described in a general\nway just what the object of the gar\nden movement in its relation to the\nindividual was. In connection with\nthe Boy Scout movement he said:\n“There is nothing that a boy or a girl\ncan undertake which will have such a\nwholesome effect than this garden\nmovement. There is nothing that will\nteach them better the rights of prop\nerty or the rights of citizenship, which\nthey will assume in a few years. In\nstilling industry in the child by learn\ning them that they can be a help and\nnot learn to depend on parents for up\nkeep will accomplish a great deal to\nwards the ideal goal,—citizenship.”\nProf. Moore then described the prac\ntical end of gardening. He emphasized\nthe three cardinal “Ts” in gardening\nThorough, Timely, Tillage. He ex\nplained the moisture supply—the im\nportance of consuming all moisture.\nThe professor also gave an exhibition\nof right and wrong use of the hoe.\nThe beetle and insect pests also\nvvere described and adequate methods\nof combatting them were described.\nMiss Cory Smith then spoke on the\nwork of the County Council of Defense\nin relation to the work of the Red\nCross.\n“Raise enough stuff and raise a\nsurplus of stuff’ was the plea of Miss\nSmith. “We must live more and more\non vegetables next winter because\nthere is a great shortage in wheat\ncrops throughout the world. But how\nare we to keep this surplus product\nraised? This surplus cannot be taken\ncare of by canning factories as there\nis in the first place a great shortage\nof cans, and factories are built to ac\ncommodate a certain quantity.”\n“It is possible to form community\nclubs in communities and fh this man\nner accomplish more than if we went\nat it alone.\n“It is suggested that we go to the\nhomes of farmers and help them dur\ning canning season, but this would be\nimpracticable.\nIn conclusion Miss Smith stated:\n“We must enter as willing workers,\nnot interested as a diversion but as a\nsacrifice to the good and welfare of\nhumanity.”\nIn order to know what local\nhelp we can expect to get for\nour pea pack this season, we\nwould suggest that those want\ning to help us, register at our\noffice, at once. The reason in\nasking this, is that we have of\nfers from outside sources, hut\nwant to employ as many of our\nhome folks as possible, and es\npecially those who have worked\nwith us the past seasons.

The\nStreet had been furiously busy for a\nmonth. The cobblestones had gone,\nand from curb to curb stretched smooth\nasphalt. To this general excitement\nthe strange case of Mr. Le Moyne had\nadded its quota. One day he was in\nthe gas office, making out statements\nthat were absolutely ridiculous. And\nthe next there was the news that Mr.\nLe Moyne had been only taking a holi\nday in the gas office and that he was\nreally a very great surgeon and had\nsaved Dr. Max Wilson.\nThe Street, which was busy at the\ntime deciding whether to leave the old\nsidewalks or to put down cement ones,\nhad one evening of mad excitement\nover the matter—of K., not the side\nwalks —and then had accepted the new\nsituation.\nBut over the news of K.’s approach\ning departure it mourned. The Street\nmade a resolve to keep K., if possible,\nIf he had shown any “high and mighti\nness,” as they called it, since the\nchange in his estate, it would have let\nhim go without protest. But when a\nman is the real thing—so that the\nnewspapers give a column to his hav\ning been in the city almost two years—\nud still goes about in the same shabby\nclothes, with the same friendly greet\ning for everyone, it demonstrates clear\nly, as the baritone put it, that “he’s got\nno swelled head on him; that’s sure.”\nA little later, K., coming up the\nStreet as he had that first day, heard\nthe baritone singing;\n"Home is the hunter, home from the hill.\nAnd the sailor, home from the sea.”\nHome! >Vhy, this was home. The\nStreet seemed to stretch out its arms\nto him. The ailanthus tree waved in\nthe sunlight before the little house.\nTree and house were old; September\nhad touched them. Christine sat sew\ning on the balcony. A boy with a piece\nof chalk was writing something on the\nnew cement under the tree. He stood\nback, head on one side, when he had\nfinished, and inspected his work. K.\nread in chalk on the smooth street:\nMax Wilson.\nSidney Page.\nThe baritone was still singing; but\nnow it was “I’m twenty-one, and she’s\neighteen.” The light was gone from\nK.’s face again. After all, the Street\nmeant for him not so much home as it\nmeant Sidney. And now, before very\nlong, that book of his life, like others,\nwould have to be closed.\nHe turned and went heavily into the\nlittle house.\nChristine called to him from her lit\ntle balcony:\n“I thought I heard your step outside.\nHave you time to come in?”\nK. went through the parlor and stood\nIn the long window. His steady eyes\nlooked down at her.\n“I see very little of you now,” she\ncomplained. And, when he did not\nreply immediately: “Have you made\nany definite plans, K.?”\n“I shall do Max’s work until he is\nable to take hold again. After that —”\n“You will go away?”\n“I think so.

But h:\nseems so futile, Christine, to leave as I\ndid, because I felt that I had no right\nto go on as things were; and now to\ncrawl back on the strength of having\nbad my hand forced, and to take up\nthings again, not knowing that I’ve a\nbit more right to do it than when I\nleft!”\n“I went to see Max yesterday.

Her\nthoughts had flown ahead to the little\nhouse without K., to days without, his\nsteps on the stairs or the heavy creak\nof his big chair overhead as he dropped\ninto it.\nBut perhaps it would be bettor if he\nwent. She hud her own life to live.\nShe had no expectation of happiness,\nbut, somehow or other, she must build\non the shaky foundation of her mar\nriage a house of life, with resignation\nserving for content, perhaps with fear\nlurking always. That she knew. But\nwith no active misery. Misery implied\naffection, and her love for Palmer was\nquite dead.\n“Sidney will be here this afternoon.”\n“Good.” His tone was noncommit\ntal.\n“Has it occurred to you, K., that Sid\nney is not very happy?”\nHe stopped in front of her.\n“She’s had a great anxiety.”\n“She has no anxiety now. Max is\ndoing well.”\n“Then what is it?”\n“I’m not quite sure, hut I think I\nknow. She’s lost faith In Max, and\nshe’s not like me. I—l knew about\nPalmer before I married him. It’s all\n\' rather hideous —I needn’t go into it.\n\' But Sidney has more character than I\n1 have. Max isn’t what she thought he\nI was, and I doubt whether she’ll marry\nhim.”\nK. glanced toward the street where\nSidney’s name and Max’s lay open to\nthe *un and to the smiles of the Street.\nChristine might he right, but that did\nnot niter things for him.\nChristine’s thoughts went back in- |\nevitably to herself; to Palmer, who j\nwas doing better just no\\s; to K„ who j\nwas going away—went back with an j\nache to the night K. had taken her in j\nhis arms and then put her away. How |\nwrong things were! What a mess life\nwas!\n“When you go away,” she said at\nlast, “I want you to remember this.\nI’m going to do my best, K. You have\ntaught me all I know. All my life I’ll\nhave to overlook things; I know that.\nBut, in his way, Palmer cares for me.\nHe will always come back, and perhaps\nsometime —”\nHer voice trailed off. Far ahead of\nher she saw the years stretching out,\nmarked, not by days and months, but\nby Palmer’s wanderings away, his re\nmorseful returns.\n“Do a little more than forgetting,”\nK. said. “Try to care for him, Chris\ntine. You did once. And that’s your\nstrongest weapon. It’s always a wom\nan’s strongest weapon. And it wins in\nthe end.”\n“I shall try, K,,” she answered\nobediently.\nBut he turned away from the look\nin her eyes.\nHarriet was abroad. She hud sent\ncards from Paris to her “trade.” It\nwas an innovation. The two or three\npeople on the Street who received her\nengraved announcement that she was\nthere, “buying new chic models for the\nautumn and winter —afternoon frocks,\nevening gowns, reception dresses, and\nwraps, from Poiret, Martial et’Armaud,\nand others,” left the envelopes casual\nly on the parlor table, as if communica\ntions from Paris were quite to be ex\npected.\nSo K. lunched alone, and ate little.\nSidney came home at half-past two —\ncame delicately flushed, as if she had\nhurried, aud with a tremulous smile\nthat caught Katie’s eyes at once.\n“Bless the child!” she said. “There’s\nuo need to ask how he is today. You’re\nall one smile.”\nThe smile set just a trifle.\n“Katie, someone has written my\nname out on the street, in chalk. It’s\nwith Doctor Wilson’s, aud it looks so\nsilly. Please go out and sweep it off.”\n“I’m about crazy with their old chalk.\nI’ll do it after a while.”\n“Please do it now, I don’t want any\none to see it. Is —is Mr, K. upstairs?”\nBut when she learned that K. was\nupstairs, oddly enough, she did not go\nup at once. She stood in the lower\nhall and listened. Yes, he was there.\nShe could hear him moving about. Her\nlips parted slightly as she listened.\nChristine, looking in from her bal\ncony, saw her there, and, seeing some\nthing in her face that she had never\nsuspected, put her hand to her throat.\n“Sidney I”\n| “Oh—hello, Chris.”\ns “Won’t you come and sit with me?”\n“I haven’t much time —that Is, I want\nto speak to K.”\n‘Won can see him when he comes\ndown.”\nSidney came slowly through the par\nlor. It occurred to her, all at once,\nthat Christine must see a lot of K.,\nespecially now. No doubt he was in\nand out of the house often. And how\npretty Christine was! She was un\nhappy, too. All that seemed to be nec\nessary to win K.’s attention was to be\nunhappy enough. Well, surely, in that\ncase—\n“ How is Max?”\n“Still better.”\nSidney sat down on the edge of the\nrailing; but she was careful, Christine\nsaw, to face the staircase. There was\nI\'m Not Going to Marry Him at All,\nChris."\nsilence on the balcony. Christine\nsewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet\nidly.\n“Doctor Ed says Mai wants you to\ngive up your training and marry him\nnow.”\n“I’m not going to marry him at all,\nChris.”\nUpstairs, K.’s door slammed. It was\none of his failings that he always\nj slammed doors. Harriet used to be\nquite disagreeable about it.\nSidney slid from the railing.\n“There he is now.”\nPerhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish\n! life, Christine had never had a bigger\nmoment than the one that followed.\nShe could have said nothing, and, in\nth.3 queer way that life goe;;, K. might\nhave gone away from the Street as\nempty of heart as he had come to it.\n“Be very good to him, Sidney,” she\nsaid unsteadily “He cares so much.”\n(Continued Wednesday.)\nHOW SHALL WE\nPAY FOR THE WAR?\nA Constructive Criticism on the\nHouse Revenue Bill.\nLOANS BETTER THAN TAXES\nFive Reasons Why Excessive Taxes at\nthe Outset of Wap Are Disadvantage\nous—Great Britain Example Worthy\nof Emulation—How the Taxes Should\nBe Apportioned.\nBy EDWIN R. A. SELIGMAN,\nMcVlckar Professor of Political Econ\nomy, Columbia University.\nOn May 23, 1917, the House of Rep\nresentatives passed an act “to provide\nrevenue to defray war expenses and\nfor other purposes.” In the original\nbill as presented by the Committee of\nWays and Means, the additional reve\nnue to be derived was estimated at sl,-\n810,420,000. The amendment to the in\ncome tax, which was tacked on to the\nbill during the discussion in the House,\nwas expected to yield another $40,000.-\n000 or $50,000,000.\nIn discussing the House bill, two\nproblems arise:\nI. How much should be raised by\ntaxation?\n11. In what manner should this sum\nbe raised?\nI. How Much Should Be Raised by\nTaxation?\nHow was the figure of $1,800,000,000\narrived at? The answer is simple. When\nthe Secretary of the Treasury came to\nestimate the additional war expenses\nfor the year 1917-18, he calculated that\nthey would amount to some $0,000,-\n000,000, of which $3,000,000,000 was to\nbe allotted to the allies, and $3,000,\n000,000 was to be utilized for the do\nmestic purposes. Thinking that it\nwould be a fair proposition to divide\nthis latter sum between loans and\ntaxes, he concluded that the amoant\nto be raised by taxes was $1,800,000.\n000.\nThere are two extreme theories, each\nof which may be dismissed with scant\ni-ourtesy. The one Is that all war ex\npenditures should be defrayed by loans\nand the other is that all war expendi\ntures should be defrayed by taxes\nEach theory is untenable.\nIt is Indeed true that the burdens of\nthe war should be borne by the pres\nent rather than the future generation;\nbut this does not mean that they should\nbe borne by this year’s taxation.\nMeeting all war expenses by taxation\nmakes the taxpayers In one or tw T o\nyears bear the burden of benefits that\nought to be distributed at least ever a\ndecade within the same generation.\nIn the second placet when expendi\nCures approach the gigantic sums of\npresent-day warfare, the tax-only pol\nicy would require more than the total\nsurplus of social income. Were this\nabsolutely necessary, the ensuing hav\noc in the economic life of the communi\nty would have to bo endured. But\nwhere the disasters are so great and\nat the same time so unnecessary, the\ntax-only policy may be declared Im\npracticable.\nSecretary McAdoo had the right in\nstinct and highly commendable cour\nage in deciding that a substantial por\ntion, at least, of the revenues should\nbe derived from taxation. But when\nhe hit upon the plan of 50-50 per cent.,\nthat is, of raising one-half of all do\nmestic war expenditures by taxes, the\nquestion arises whether he did not go\ntoo far.\nThe relative proportion of loans to\ntaxes is after all a purely business\nproposition. Not to rely to a large ex\ntent on loans at the outset of a war is\na mistake.\nDisadvantages of Excessive Taxes.\nThe disadvantages of excessive taxes\nat the outset of the war are us follows:\n1. Excessive taxes on consumption\nwill cause popular resentment.\n2. Excessive taxes on Industry will\ndisarrange business, damp enthusiasm\nand restrict the spirit of enterprise at\nthe very time when the opposite is\nneeded.\n3. Excessive taxes on Incomes will do\nplete the surplus available for invest\ntnents and interfere with the placing of\nthe enormous loans which will be neces\nsary in any event.\n4. Excessive taxes on wealth will\ncause a serious diminution of the in\ncomes which are at present largely\ndrawn upon for the support of educa\ntional and philanthropic enterprises.\nMoreover, these sources of support\nwould be dried jup precisely at the time\nwhen the need would be greatest.\n5. Excessive taxation at the outset of\nthe war will reduce the elasticity avail\nable for the ire,-easing demands that\nnre soon to ccme.\nGreat Britain’s Policy.\nTake Great Britain as an example\nDuring the first year of the war she\nIncreased taxes only slightly, in order\nto keep industries going at top notch\nDuring the second year she nused by\nnew taxes only I) per cent, of her war\nexpenditures. During the third year\nshe levied by additional taxes (over\nand above the pre-war level • only\nslightly more than 17 per cent, of her\nwar expenses.\nIf we should attempt to do as much\nin the first year of the war ns Great\nBritain did In the third year it would\nsuffice to raise by taxation $1,250,000.-\n000. If, In order to be absolutely on\nthe safe side, it seemed advisable to\nincrease the sum to $1,300,000,000. this\nshould, in our opinion, he the maxi>\nVium.\nla considering the apportionment of\nthe extraordinary burden of taxes In\nwar times certain scientific principles\nare definitely established:\nHow Taxes Should Be Apportioned.\n(1) The burden of taxes must be\nspread as far as possible over the\nwhole community so as to cause each\nindividual to share in the sacrifices ac\ncording to his ability to pay and ac\ncording to his share in the Government.\n(2) Taxes on consumption, which are\nnecessarily borne by the community at\nlarge, should he imposed ns far as pos\nsible on articles of quasi-luxury rather\nthan on those of necessity.\n(3) Excises should be imposed as far\nas possible upon commodities in the\nhands of the final consumer rather\nthan upon the articles which servo pri\nmarily as raw material for further\nproduction.\n(4) Taxes upon business should be\nimposed as far as possible upon net\nearnings rather than upon gross re\nceipts or capital invested.\n(5) Taxes upon income which will\nnecessarily be severe should be both\ndifferentiated and graduated. That is\nthere should be a distinction between\nearned and unearned incomes and there\nshould be a higher rate upon the larger\nincomes. It is essential, however, not\nto make the income rate so excessive\nas to lead to evasion, administrative\ndifficulties, or to the more fundamental\nobjections which have been urged\nabove.\n(G) The excess profits which are due\nto the war constitute the most obvious\nand reasonable source of revenue dur\ning war times. But the principle upon\nwhich these war-profit taxes are laid\nmust be equitable In theory and easily\ncalculable iu practice.\nThe Proposed Income Tax.\nThe additional Income tax as passed\nby the House runs up to a rate of 60\nper cent. This is a sum unheard of In\nthe history of civilized society. It must\nbe remembered that it was only after\nthe first year of the war that Great\nBritain increased her income tax to the\nmaximum of 34 per cent., and that\neven now in the fourth year of the war\nthe Income tax does not exceed 42 1 /.*\nper cent.\nIt could easily be shown that a tax\nwith rates on moderate Incomes sub\nstantially less than In Great Britain\nand on the larger incomes about as\nhigh, would yield only slightly less than\nthe $532,000,000 originally estimated In\nthe House bill.\nIt is to be hoped that the Senate will\nreduce the total rate on the highest in\ncomes to 34 per cent, or at most to 40\nper cent, and that at the same time it\nwill reduce the rate on the smaller in\ncomes derived from personal or profes\nsional earnings.\nIf the war continues we shall have to\ndepend more and more upon the in\ncome tax. By imposing excessive rates\nnow we are not only endangering the\nfuture, but are inviting all manner of\ndifficulties which even Great Britain\nhas been able to escape.\nConclusion.\nThe House bill contains other funda\nmental defects which may be summed\nup as follows:\n(1) It pursues an erroneous principle\nin imposing retroactive taxes.\n(2 1 It selects an unjust and unwork\nable criterion for the excess-profits tax.\n(3) It proceeds to an unheard-of\nheight in the income tax.\n(4) It Imposes unwarranted burdens\nupon the consumption of the commu\nnity.\n(5) It la calculated to throw business\nInto confusion by levying taxes on gross\nreceipts instead of upon commodities.\n(G) It fails to make a proper use of\nstamp taxes.\n(7) It follows an unscientific system\nin its flat rate on imports.\n(8) It includes a multiplicity of pet\nYou Men and Women Who Want\nYour Money’s Worth!\nLiberty Bonds Pay V 2% But Every Dollar Invested\nin the War Work of the Y.

ALL CAN HELP\nw\ntyand unlucratlve taxes, the vexatious\nness of which is out of all proportion to\nthe revenue they produce.\n• ***•••\nThe fundamental lines on which the\nHouse bill should be modified are sum\nmed up herewith:\n(1) The amount of now taxation\nshould be limited to $1,250,000.000—0r\nat the outset to $1,500,000,000. To do\nmore than this would be as unwise as\nit is unnecessary. To do even this\nwould be to do more than has ever\nbeen done by any civilized Govern\nment In time of stress.\n(2) The excess-profits tax based upon\na sound system ought to yield about\n$500,000,000.\n(3) The income-tax schedule ought to\nbe revised with a lowering of the rates\non earned incomes below SIO,OOO. and\nwith an analogous lowering of the\nrates on the higher incomes, so as not\nto exceed 34 per cent. A careful cal\nculation shows that an Income tax of\nthis kind would yield soipe $450,000.-\n000 additional.\n(4) The tax on whisky and tobacco\nought to remain approximately as it is.\nwith a yield of about $230,000,000.\nThese three taxes, together with the\nstamp tax at even the low rate of the\nHouse bill, and with an improved au\ntomobile tax, will yield over $1,250,-\n000,000, which is the amount of money\nthought desirable.\nThe above program would be in har\nmony with an approved scientific sys\ntem. }t will do away with almost nil\nof the complaints that are being urged\nagainst the present. It will refrain\nfrom taxing the consumption of the\npoor.\nIt will throw a far heavier burden\nupon the rich, but will not go to the\nextremes of confiscation. It will ob\nviate interference with business and\nwill keep unimpaired the social pro\nluctivlty of the community.\nIt will establish a just balance be\ntween loans and taxes and will not\nsuccumb to the danger of approaching\n3lther the tax-only policy or the loan\nmly policy. Above all. it will keep\nan undisturbed elastic margin, which\nmust be more and more heavily drawn\n<apon as the war proceeds.\nGET RID OF CABBAGE WORMS\nSprinkle Paris Green, Mixed With\nFlour, Slaked Lime or Dry Road\nDust Over Plants.\nIf the green cabbage worms are\nbothering the cabbages which were set\nout last fall, sprinkle some paris green\nmixed with some flour, slaked lime or\ndry road dust all over the plants. Use\none ounce to five pounds of the lime\nor other mixture. Don’t be afraid to\nuse this .poison, as there is no danger\nof its hurting you when eating the cab\nbage. And, too, the cabbage heads from\nthe center and the outside leaves are\nInvariably pulled off before using.\nGOATS ADAPTED TO GRAZING\nEconomical Producers Under Ordinary\nFarm Conditions—Thrive on\nThin Pasturage.\nAngora goats are economical pro\nducers under anything like ordinary\nfarm conditions. They are well adapt\ned to grazing and can be maintained\non rather thin pasture. Yet this is\nnot desirable for best results. The\ngoats should have ample pasture, grain\nand hay as supplements. Mohair has\nbeen bringing good prices recently and\nfresh goat meat is highly desirable as\na food.\nBEETS COMMAND GOOD PRICE\nPlant Is Easy to Grow and May Be\nLeft in Storage All Winter—\nMore Being Consumed.\nGrow more beets. They are easy to\ngrow and may be buried or left in\nstorage all winter. Winter beets have\ncommanded good prices for several\nyears.
