Mi\nThe Neely shortage has now\nreached $131,173.\nTexas wool growers are holding over\n2,000.000 pounds of wool for better\nprices. _\nThe Reno Journal brings the news\nthat the Prohibition party is to be\nresurrected in Nevada.\nReno has a fire alarm system now,\nand the benighted residents of that\ntown persist in trying to mail their\nletters in the alarm boxes.\nIt is rumored that the Goloonda\nNews plant is to be removed to Win\nnemncca where it will be nsed in\nthe publication of a semi-weekly\nnewspaper.\nThe White Pine News announces\nthat it will support Bryan and Ste\nvenson this yesr. Hitherto the News\nhas been a Republican paper, but\nthat platform proved too muob for it.\nSilver is said to be very scarce at\nNome, a twenty-dollar gold piece\nbeing worth only 318 in silver.\nWe have been thinking\nWhat a fine world this would be.\nIf all the gold-bug* were transported\nFar beyond the Arctic Sea.\nThrough the courtesy of Eugene\nHowell, Secretary of State, the Sen\ntinei. has received a pamphlet con\ntaining the laws relating to elections\nin Nevada. The volume was com\npiled by Secretary Howell, and em\nbraces all the information that one\ncould desire on that subject.\nSheep have decreased io value\nmore than a dollar a bead witbiD\nthe past few months, and the price\nof wool has dropped so low that the\nsboepmen can no longer afford to\nsell at the quotations offered. The\nconnection between Mr. McKinley\'s\n“prosperity” tariff and the sheep\nindustry has evidently been tam\npered with.\nThe people of Nye county are\nagain agitating the question of dis\norganization, claiming that the bur\nben of taxation to meet the expenses\nof a county government is becoming\nunbearable. Evidently the people\nover tbero have not heard of that\n“wave of prosperity” that swept\nover the entire country lately.\nAn insane individual from Cali\nfornia was in Balt Lake City the\nother day and informed the Tribune\nof that oity that Nevada is certainly\ngoing Republican this year. An\nother enthusiast assures the same\nsheet that Colorado will elect Mc\nKinley eleotors this year. When it\nis remembered that Colorado gave\nBryan a plurality of 134,882 last\nyear the reliability of the Tribune’s\npolitical news will be estimated at\nits true worth.\nTho editor of the Elko Indepen\ndent, who acted as referee in the\nrecent encounter between County\nAttorney Van Dozer of Humboldt\ncounty and O. M. Bain of the Love\nlook Tribune, has officially deolared\nthat the battle was a draw. Here is\nthe opportunity Onraon has been\nlooking for. A “tight to a finish”\nbetween these two noted pugilists\nwould draw an audience from all\nparts of the Pacifio slope, and at\nthe same time would establish the\nclaim of Nevada\'s Capital City to\nbeing sporting headquarters for this\nnation. Dan Btuart, where art thou?\nAccording to a California exchange\nthe Ban Franoisco daily papers find\nthemselves occupying embarrassing\npositions. There is the Examiner\nthat does not believe in the Demo\ncratic tariff polioy, but is foroed tc\nuphold it; the Chroniole, a strong\npartisan of free silver, foroed tc\ndenounee it ass fallaoy, and the Call\nwhile proclaiming its hatred of Bry\nanient, is yet taking exaotly the\nBryan view of expansion. All threi\nwill battle mightily for the princi\nples which they do not believe in\nand loudly proolaim the virtues o\nmen whom in the depths of the edi\ntorial hearts they would like to se<\ndefeated,\nKING HUMBERT I DEAD\nItaly’s Monarch Slain by a Cow\nardly Assassin.\n_ .. j\nMurderer Is Captured—A Na\ntive of Tuscany.\n\\ h rom Monthly** Extra Edit ion—Special IHupatch, j\nMoksa, Italy, July 30—King Hnntbert was shot, here last!\nevenit If*: to o’clock by a man named Angelo Bresse, and\ndied at 11:30. The King was attending a distribution of prizes\nin connection with a gymnastic exhibition, and had just entered\nhis carriage with his aide de camp amid the cheers of the crowd,\nwhen three revolver shots were fired in quick succession. One\nbullet pierced the heart of His Majesty, who fell back into the\narms of his officers.\nThe assassin was immediately arrested, and was, with some\ndifficulty, saved from the fury of the populace. He gave his\nname as Angelo Bresse, and says he is from Prato in Tuscany.\nHe is an Anarchist.\nNews of the terrible event did not arrive in Borne until after\nmidnight. Signor S. Saracco, the Premier, immediately sum\nmoned a meeting of the Cabinet and the Ministers will start at\nthe earliest possible moment for Monsa.\nThe Prince and Princess of Naples are on board the Yela,\nyachting in Levant.\nThe assassinated monarch was born March 14, 1844, and\nacceded to the throne January 9, 1878.\n•\'400,000 NAYM a K It KITH.\nThat la Abonl lb* Price Pbl« lor\n•ba itablinmu,\nThe Halt Lake Tribune of July 21\nsays:\n"Dix W. Smith, a prominent at\ntorney of Elmira, N. Y., who has\nwith expert talent just completed an\nexhaustive examination of the Chain\nman group of mines at Ely. Nev.,\nreports the purchase of the proper\nty by himself, associated with New\nYork and Pennsylvania investors.\nJust how mnoh of a roll was re\nquired to capture the proposition\nMr. Smith, who boarded the trainfor\nthe East yesterday, after a night at\nthe Knntsford, would not divulge,\nalthough it is said that the figure is\naround the $200,000 mark. The gen\ntlemen who have joined him in the\nundertaking are prominent residents\nof Elmira and Corning, N. Y., and\nBradford, Warren and Titusville,\nPa. The syndicate, said Mr. Smith,\nis one of the most powerful that has\nsought the West for investment, and\nis capable of discharging anything it\n\' may undertake. The Chainman is\n! one of the best known propositions\nj in all Nevada, and while neglected\nj (or a long time after its first record\n: was mado, is now equipped with a\ncyanide plant and is a regular con\ntributor of gold dust at the gold\nsampling rooms in this city, and\nwith new blood in its veins the plant\nwill be increased and the output\nmade to at least doublo itself. Mr.\nSmith will return from the East in a\nshort time, when formal possession\nof the mines and mill will be turned\nover to him, and the season’s cam\npaign inaugurated.\n“Before leaving Ely the gentle\nman learned that in the same camp\nproperties have been bonded by\nHon. W. A. Clark of Montana, and\nthat several other investors of prom\ninence are sparring for a foothold.”\nMetluesri Ore\nThe Southern Pacific Railroad Com\npany has reduced the rate for ship\nment of ores over the Carson & Color\nado railroad, which it recently acquired,\nand railroad men intimate that there\nis a prospect for still futher reductions.\nRates on ores, worth not over $20 per\nton, from all points on the Carson &\nColorado road to the smelter, have\n1 been reduced from $0 to $5 per ton,\n1 effective July 1st. From points between\n■ Wabuska and Mound House rates for\nmerly $0, have been dropped to $5 50.\n[ From Candelaria, Hawthorne and\npoints between the rate was modified\n\' on June 12th so that on ores of high\n• value the rate for which was previous\nly $12 50, ll now $10.\nRAII.KOAIi IIPUVMHT1.\nPrtmrtllwai Belas Made for the\nlomlng Ihorl Liar.\nThe Southern Pacific officials who\nwere in Ogden Tuesday night all\nwent west tho next morning, with\nthe exception of Vice-President\nKruttschnitt, who remained in town\nuntil 11:15 and also went west. Not\none of the officials would talk, but\nfrom outside souroes it was learned\nthat the Tribune’s statement of yes\nterday morning that the officials\nwere here arranging for the begin\nning of work on the ont-off is cor\nrect, and that actual work will begin\nvery soon.\nIt is safe to prediot that on the\neast end of the Southern Paoiflo, or\nthat portion between Ogden and\nlieno, there will be the greatest\namount of railroad work done that\nhas ever been known to the employes\nof the road. It is said that 4,000\nmen and 1,000 horses will be en\ngaged, the oamps to be strung out\nall along the deserts of Utah and\nNevada.\nThese outfits and men will be\nengaged iu a general straightening\nout of ourves, raising track and cut\nting down grades. The whole is to\nbe built np on the most modern\nplans and will gradually be ballasted.\nImprovements on the line between\nLucin and Ogden that have already\nbeen made were on a somewhat tem\nporary basis, so that there will be no\nfinancial loss when the cut off does\naway with the present track as far as\na through line is conoerned. Most\nof the rectifying of the line will be\npushed between Lnoin and Reno,\nand when the out-off is completed it\nwill make a pretty straight and easy\nline from the lake basin to the foot\nof the Sierras. The outlook is very\nbright on the Southern Pacific for\nan era of prosperity that even its\nowners have not wholly anticipated.\nThe Ogden route became the new line\nto the Philippines and Hawaii dur\ning the troubles in the former and\nafter the annexation of the latter. It\nis now the choice route for supplies\nand soldiers en route to China, and\nthe traffio is beooming so great tha\nthe railway hardly knows what to do\nwith it all.\nFor these reasons every degree of\ncurvature, every foot of grade re\nduoed will be a great help to the\ncompany’s operating department,\nand for the next two years work will\nmove nnoeasingly. It will bring\nplenty of money to Ogden, and that\ncity is jubilant over the prospect —\nBalt Lake Tribune.\nEUREKA\nCASH_STORE\nI have opened a first-class\nGROCERY STORE\nin the building formerly\noccu|4ed by the Brown\nRestaurant on the east\nside of\nNORTH MAIN STREET\nThe Stock is New and of the\nBEST QUALITY\nand to be Sold at\nCHEAP PRICES\nBy fair dealing and eareful attention to\nthe wants of customers I hope to merit and\nreceive a fair share of the patronage in the\ngeneral merchandizing line, and feel confi\ndent that I can satisfy the most critical.\nI also hold the Eureka agency for the\nChicago Tailors’ Association.

It is estimated that there is\nabout sixty tons of old mete! remaining\nin and about the building, and when this\nis removed all that will be left of that\nmammoth plan! is tbe air compressor\nand two blowers on tbs lower floor, and\ntbe light machinery reoently used by\ntbe Kureka Sampling Works od the\nfloor above. Tbe buildioge, Superin\ntendent MoTerney Heye, will not be\nmolested.\nAt tms time, when the leet oi\nthe two big plant! are being obliterated,\nsome idee of tbe wealth whioh the mines\noi the two oompaniea have produced\nhere may be interesting. Of course\nthe actual values of tbe ore taken ont\ncan not be even guessed at, but the fol\nlowing figures taken from the County\nAssessor’s books and covering the period\nfrom April 1, 1873, to April 1, 1900,\nwill give tome idea of tbs enormous\nproduction of tbe two properties:\nK\'JHKKA OONaOUIlATtCD.\n(irons value of output . .$17,480,923.03\nNet value. 5,290.277.35\nTaxes paid . 120,838.80\nRICHMOND.\n(irons value of output. .$15,713,975.08\nNet value . 4,914 169.(n\nTaxes paid. 119,044.27\nThus it will bs teen that the grots\noutput of these two mines alone has\namounted to the enormous sum of\n$33,194,898.71, while the net produot is\n$10,210,440.90— according to tbe books\nof the County Assessor— and daring that\nperiod, from April 1, 18,3, to April 1,\n1900, they have paid in taxes into the\ncounty treasury the sum of $239,378.13.\nThe mines, of course, are still being\noperated, though tbe output has been\ngreatly diminished, owiug to this pecu\nliar order of "prosperity” the evidsnossof\nwhich are so conspicuous on every band.\nHowever, there Is a practically inex\nhaustible supply of valuable ora yet re\nmaining in the depths of these and\nneighboring mines, and by and by, when\nthe American people have returned to\nj their senses, it will be io demand.\nHome From the Writ.\nHenry Kind returned borne on Thurs\nday from a trip to Keno and Carson,\nwhere he had been on “bueineas.” He\naaye Reno ie booming, but that Caraon ii\nenjoying a Ilip Van Winkle nap from\nwhich it would be a shame to awakei\nher.\nMr. Kind visited the State in.titutiom\nand apaake vary highly of the manner ii\nwhich they are conducted.

While others have\nbeen connected with the Sentinel at\ndifferent times during the years gone\nby it is to the executive ability and\nbusiness sagacity of Archibald Skill\nman that the credit is due for what\never measure of proejierity the paper\nhas enjoyed, and even for its very ex\nistence today.\nMr. Skillman died at San Francisco\nat 2 o’clock on the afternoon of\nWednesday, August 1, after a linger\ning illness. Although for several\nmonths past he had been almost con\nstantly under the physician’s care it is\na consolation to know that during his\nlast sickness he suffered very little if\nany pain, and that his end was as\nl>eaceful as that of a little child.\nArchibald Skillman was born at\nPrinceton, New Jersey, on April 2,\n1824, and was therefore 76 years of\nage on his last birthday. In his early\nmanhood he came to the Pacific Coast,\nand in 1851 was half owner of the Pa\ncific News, one of the very first news\npapers published in Sail Francisco,\nand at the time of his death was the\noldest newspaper man on this coast.\nAfter about a year’s experience there,\nduring which time the plant was\ntwice destroyed by fire, he founded\nthe Shasta (Cal.) Courier, then the\nonly paper in that State north of\nMarysville, and which today is recog\nnized as the second oldest paper in\nCalifornia.\nAfter a few years Mr. Skillman be\ncame dissatisfied with his surround\nings there, and, disposing of the\nCourier, came to Nevada. For a time\nhe occupied the position of foreman in\nthe office of the Territorial Enterprise\nat Virginia City, but at the time of the\nWhite Pine excitement in I860 his en\nergetic nature and ambition to succeed\nprompted him to seek his fortune in\nthat region of vast possibilities, and\nhe cast his lot with the pioneers of\nthis section of the Sagebrush State.\nEarly in 1870 be began the publica\ntion of the Shermantown Reporter at\nshermantown, White Pine county,\nbut, as is common in mining commu\nnities, that town was short-lived, and\nMr. Skillman removed the material to\nEureka, where on the 16th day of\nJuly, 1870, he presented to the people\nof this camp the first number of Tine\nKi kkk a Sentinel.\nWith the exception of a short time\nduriug which he published the White\nPine News, then located at Hamilton,\nMr. Skillman has ever since been the\nruling spirit in the publication of the\nSentinel. With the instinct which\nonly » true newspaper man can feel\nthe success of his paper was to him\nabove every other thought of wealth,\npreferment, or personal comfort. To\nit he sacrificed the best years of his\nlife, and as we pen these lines a feel\ning of awe and of sadness comes over\nus when we think of the past and\nwhat the future will be shorn of his\nwise counsel and ever-devoted atten*\ntlon to all the details of the business.\nDuring President Cleveland’s first\nadministration Mr. Skillman was ap\npointed Internal Revenue Collector for\nthe district then embracing the States\nof Nevada and Utah, and held the\noffice until Nevada was attached to\nthe California district.\nies; the Sentinel mourns today—\nmourns for the man who has ever been\nto it more than a father to a child—\nand who in a distant city, far from\nfriends who knew and loved him here,\nyielded up his life, a prey to the rav\nages of disease and old age.\nAs we said before, it is a sad duty\nthat the Sentinel is now called upon\nto perform—a delicate and painful\nduty—and as it attempts to convey to\nthe sorrowing widow and son words of\ncomfort in their bereavement, the\nwriter can not hold back the tears that\ncourse unbidden down bis cheeks, and\nan unuttered prayer is breathed to the\nthrone on high that he may never\nagain be called upon to perform an\nother such painful office.\nIn a short time the bereaved ones\nwill return to their home here, and\nthe surviving will guide the Sentinel’s\ndestinies through the coming years,\nbut be those years few or many, the\nname of Archibald Skillman will for\never hang like a halo about that of the\nKi heka Sentinel, and his person\nality will be associated with its every\naffair.\nIt may be some conaolation to the\nsorrowing ones to know that during\nliis last illness, and now at the an\nnouncement of his death, only the\nkindest words have been heard of the\ndeparted one here where he was known\nso long and so well, and from all sides\nare heard expressions of profound\nsorrow.\nWith this last tribute to the memory\nof its departed owner the Sentinel\nsorrowfully turns its face to the future,\nwith the knowledge that in continuing\nin the path marked out for it by the\nman who has thus been called away\nit cau best do honor to his memory;\nand in the rears to come it will be\nits constant aim to be worthy of him\nwho gave a quarter of a century of\nhis life to the task of establishing it\nupon a sound basis.\nThe funeral services took place at\n11 o\'clock Friday morning at the\nMortuary Chapel of the Odd Fellows\nCrematory, San Francisco.\nKIckMl by • Hone\nOn Thureday afternoon George Hen\ndereon wee quite eeverely injured by\na kiok from a horee.
