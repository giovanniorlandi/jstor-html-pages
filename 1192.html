At the last" regu\nlar meeting of Council three were\nelected, and the next day two refused\nto service. This necessitated a spo\ncial meeting of the City Council last\nFriday night, at which two gentlemen\nwere elected to fill the vacancies. It\nhas since been ascertained that one of\nthese is not eligible, not being a prop\nerty holder, which necessitates an\nother meeting of Council to elect a\nthird \' member. This is one of the\nmost important positions in the city\nand It should be the patriotic duty of\nany man who is eligible to serve if\nhe can possibly spare tho time from\nhis business or other employment. A\nlarge number have been asked to\nserve, but all have refused, so if you\nwant to be the third member of the\nboard juet tell the Mayor and at the\nspecial meeting tonight you will be\nchosen.\nA VETERAN EMPLOYE\nAgent W.

In the\nabsence of Secretary Baker, who is\nin the south on an Inspection tour, no\none would talk officially but the Im\npression was given that no lnforma\ntion had reached the department to\nindicate an Intention to change the\n3 announced policy of brigading Ameri\ncans with the British and French armr\nles so as to hasten their arrival at\nthe front to aid In stemming the Gor\nman assault.\nIt is no secret that. President Wil\nson and his military advisers con\nsented to this arrangement only to\n1 1 meet a great emergency and to aid in\nn eliliii" the Allied armies on the west\nern front Into one effective force. To\ndo it. they had to ask tho army for a\nsacrifice, which under other circum\nstances would not .have been consid\nered.\nUnder the plan of filling up the\nBritish and French gaps with Ameri\ncan reserves, the Americans would be\nequipped and supplied by the armies\nto which they were attached.

Good hcavensl Was any courage ever\nwasted or can it bet They tell us that there is no such thing in the\nalchemy of Nature as the possible elimination of any slightest force\n- or the destruction of even an atom of matted. In all the marvelous\neconomy of the universe nothing material is ever wasted, not the\nfragments of exploded planets, not the desiccated leaves of trees\nnor petals of the humblest flower; not the dust of the dear, nor the\nsmoke of a burning match. All is saved with minutest care and in\nterwoven again with matchless skill into the warp and woof of the\nfabric of this boundless universe in which we live !\nWhat about our virtues, then? Can they be wasted? What\n.about the unselfish love of mothers lavished , upon unworthy chil\n. dren ; the devotion of disappointed advocates of lost causes ; men\nand women who died upon crosses and gibbets; the heroes, the paints\nand the martyrs of all these frenzied centuries of cruel ignorance\nand misunderstanding? Has the fragrance of their-lives been lost\nwhen the invisible partivles which produce the odors of violets and\nmusk 4tve on somewhere forever?"\nNobody but a boche can believe it! Disciples of Neitvhes and\nbrothers of Cain, .advocates of sehercklichkeit and apostles of kul.\ntur and adherents of the doctrine that might makes right, they can\nnot think otherwise than this dead materialist did, perhaps; but\nWe solemnly protest ! That little hero did not live or die in vain.\n, Not only did the incense of that glorious deed g up like a sweet\nsorrow to the author of his being, but it lias been wafted around\nthe world and will fertilize the timid courage of the souls of count\nless youth, "till the sun grows cold and the stars arc old, and the\nleaves b fthe judgment book unfold."\nWas the courage of Nathan Hale wasted? God save the mark!\nCANTEEN WO! K\nI "\n\'.There is probably not a sinple canteen in France among all the\nlong line of rest and refreshment stations that the American and\nFrench Red Cross are uniting to establish where somebody\'s genius\nfor homcmaking or poetry is. rot bringing an unexpected bit of\njsomfort or interest or beauty. Where thisbit of home or spirit is\nexpressed, immediately it affects every one, like an amazingly swift\ncompound interest and extending its influence to the next sojourner\nand the next canteen where an .American woman has planted a flow\ner bed along a munition factory wall. And there is another where\n, a French soldierleft a book fr his fellows to write or draw sudden\n"inspiration" in and they did experiences that the newcomehs\n\'roar with delight over, tributes to lost comrades and great sacrifices,\ndrawings that some day may be immortal, a "blank" book which\n. some time will help future generations of France to love and under.\n: stand this one. There is still another canteen where a woman work-\n-er has made a shelf for children\'s toys, for the small visitors who\neome sometimes. And, at a great railroad station where the troop\n, trains start fr the front, Mme. Courcol (never rests) takes the flow\ners or the lovely weeds and grasses which have been dcorating her\nrefreshment truck from which the outgoing soldiers have been hav\ning bread and coffee and fastens them high and jauntly to the end\nof the train just before it moves out the field flowers, the lillies\nand the flag of France. Many American women who have been liv\ning abroad are now in the canteen service of the Red Cross. Fifty\n; have recently sailed, fifty more are preparing to go soon, and other\ngroups continually will be leaving. Wherever they Mill lie on duty\nin thjs war some outward life of the spirit will blowim. The nearer\nthey are to the front line the more frequently their sheds, their\neellars or their dugouts are bombarded, the more naturally will they\nhang green branches to the door, feston the ceiling with bright col-\nore or tack some heartening picture to the wall, not out of deliberate\npurposes, but out of their natural instinct. It, is, perhaps, the princi\npal reason why they are so needed. There is something almost wist-\n" ful"in women\'s wonder if they will rise to the emergency of havoc\nand destruction. They have been on duty in many a shattered place,\nand yej. the next shed under the same fire had more of home than\nthe one before. It is woman in war and in peace.

They enter\ned Into this unholy compact with a\ndistinct promlso from the Kaiser and\ntho military clique that within one\nyear from the beginning of the war\nthey would be able to reap tho enor\nmous profits which were promised to\nthem, and dominate the trade of the\nvorld, as Germany proposed to domi\nnate the nations of tho earth.\nIn all human history there is no\nrecord so damning and damnablo of\na nation which definitely committed\nItself to murder, to outraging, to pil\nlaging, to all the horrors of a world\nwar, for the individual profit of Its\nbusiness men and tho aggrandize\nment of its military power.\nThis is the blackest story in human\n\'ilstory.

F. McAullffe, Covington, a retired\nMason county farmer, said he would\nurge District Attorney Thomas Slat\ntery to place the matter before proper\nFederal authorities for investigation.\n, "Tobacco Is improperly cured and\nof little value, although big prices are\nbeing paid," said Mr. McAuliffe.\n" \' As a corrective measure bo suggests\nthat Government inspectors be detail\n" - ed to see that tobacco is properly\noured. and "sweated" before being\nplaced on the market by buyers or\nmanufacturers.\n- Prices should be regulated also dur\ning the period of the war, he said.\n"The farmer is receiving six times\nthe price for his product obtainable\ntwo or three years ago," he declared.\n"Tobacco which brought five or six\ncents a pound in 1916 was sold for 20\nand 30 cents last year. Under the\npresent enormous demand tobacco\nbuyers buy up the tobacco patches\nas soon as they are planted, some\n; times paying as high as 30 cents a\npound. The buyer gives tho farmer\nlittle1 timo to properly cure tobacco\nin his haste to place it on the mar\nket" - The result, declares Mr. McAuliffe,\n\' is an uncured product of little value,\nfor which the public pays \' a high\nprice. .\nRET.

Communities should figure on their\nneeds for both wood and coal and\nrealize that coal may not be forth\ncoming, and wood muBt be used In its\nplace. "Every stick of wood burned\nIs a lick against tho KalBer." .\nAs individuals, It Is up to each one\nto see that his own needs are prov\nided for in accordance with the new\ndemnnds made by the nation at war\nfor an enormous amount of coal. Do\nnot wait until there Is an emergency\ndemand at the approach of bitter\nweather next winter, but got out tbe\nwood now at odd times from waste\nmaterial and rest assured that there\nwill be ready market for more than\nis cut. Win the war with wood.\nNext winter Is going to be the run\nand we Cannot begin too soon to pre\npare for it. Battleships and locomo\ntives cannot burn wood nor can muni\ntion factories burn\' wood, but the\nfarmers \'of Kentucky can burn wood\nand should do so In keeping with the\nwar program.\nA cord of wood on the average It\nsaid to have a fuel value of more than\n2-3 of a ton of coal.\nThe increased coal requirements\nduring the coming coal year will be\none hundred million tons. With the\nincreased maximum production at tho\nmines, half of this amount, I. e., fifty\nmillion tons more coal, can be .pro\ncured, but the other fifth million tons\nmust bo saved. If," therefore, It were\nin any way possible to Increase tho\nwood cutting 75 per cent, throughout\nthe country,\' we should have the\nequivalent of fifty million tons of .coal\nadded to our supply.\nLike food, so is coal of most impor\ntance in winning this war. The mean\ning is clear except to these who will\nnot see. There is a real shortage of\ncoal. It cannot be brushed aside by\nlaws, regulations or resolutions. Noth\ning but real saving will bring about\nthese results. The Government must\nand will see that coal is saved.\nMost people think it is a hardship\nto have to burn wood. We admit it\nis not as convenient and means more\nwork, t but unless the people them\nselves make sacrifices, it is more than\nlikely an embargo will be placed on\ncoal next winter to those who have\naccess to supplies of wood.\nVery truly yours,\nW.
