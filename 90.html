PRICE TEN CENTS, JURY ACQUITS JOSEPH M\'DONALD, MacDonald Verdict, Is Not Guilty, MacDonald Makes Statement, Joseph .MacDonald this morn, ing said: "I have never for a, moment doubted that the tinal, result would be other than it is., 1 am glad that it is over. For, myself and family I wish to ex, press our gratitude for the kind, treatment and support received, from the people of Juneau,, Douglas Island, Skagway and of, Alaska generally. We wish also, to express our thanks particular, ly to the twelve good and true, meu who were drawn on the, jury, as well as to the presiding, judge for his fairness. We wish, to extend our heartfelt thanks, to the counsel representing us in, this case and to all our friends., We hold nothing but good will, for all and malice toward none.", I, * *, Joseph MacDonald stood before the, world a free man by the unanimous, verdict of the jury rendered last night, in just one hour and thirty-five min, utes after it had received the instruc, tions of Fred M. Brown. The final, words of the long, gruelling trial, came at 10:30 o\'clock, when the ver, diet, "We, the jury in the above en, titled cause, find the defendant not, guilty." were spoken., It is understood that but one ballot, w^as taken by the jurors, and that it, was unanimous, The climax of the long trial was at, tended by one of the most dramatic, scenes ever witnessed in a Juneau, court room. As the words "not guilty", were uttered by Clerk of the Court, K. \\V. Pettit. the spectators broke into, cheers, which were mingled with the, sobs of the women friends of Mrs., MacDonald. wife of the defendant., The latter, who sat immediately be, hind her husband, with her face rad, iant with joy, sprang toward him. Just, as she had placed one arm about his, neck, she fainted and fell to the floor, The cheering ceased, and with awsome, fears, those in the court room awaited, the efforts to revive .Mrs. MacDonald. !, She had only partly regained con, sciousness when she was carried from, the court room and takvn to the tem ,, porary home of the MacDonalds in this, city., Judge Brown congratulated the jury, upon the termination of its work, say, ing, "members of the jury, yours, has j, been a long and arduous task and you, have performed it well. I want to, thank you for the manner in which, you have acquitted yourselves. This, community owes you its thanks. 1 j, want to commend you for the verdict, you have rendered. It is a just ver, dict., Court Room Crowded., The court room was jammed when, the evening session opened and the en, trance from the corridor was choked, with interested humanity trying vain, ly to grasp the voice of the prosecutor, in the last half-hour of his eight-hour |, argument. Immediately after the read, ing of the charge which followed and, the adjournment of court until 10 o\', clock today all but the attorneys for, the defense and friends of the defend, ant left the building., Mac Donald declared his intention, of sitting in the court room until the, jury brought in its verdict and so he, sat surrounded by his friends. All of, the members of his family were pres, ent. Many women were present and, there still remainer a lareg assembly i, in the space set apart for spectators., Judge Brown retired to his room at, the Orpheum hotel and there awaited, for the jur>* to summon him., Rustgard Concludes Powerful Speech., United States District Attorney John, Kustgard concluded his powerful ar, gument to the jury at 7:30 o\'clock last, evening. He spoke at all three ses, sions of the court yesterday, and took, the jury over every particle of the evi, dence that had been introduced, ana, lyzing it, interpreting it as it appeared, to the prosecution, and suggesting the, conclusions he thought the jury should, arrive at., Trial Consumed Twenty Days., The trial of Joseph MacDonald for, shooting N. C. Jones, at Treadwell,, May 14, 1!M)2, consumed twenty days., It began July 8. and terminated yes, terday, July 30th. There were thfee, intervening Sundays. Twenty-eight, witnesses testified for the prosecueion,, and seventy-three for the defense., The counsel for the government and, the defendant occupied six session of, j the court, equivalent to three days in, presenting their arguments to the, I jury., Trial Notable in Annals of Criminal, Laws., The trial" of Joseph MacDonald that, eame to such a dramatic ending last, night marks a notable incident in the, annals of American criminal law. N., (\'. Jones, probably insane on religious, matters, had become obsessed with the, conviction that he had been called, by the l.ord to close the Treadwell, mines on Sundays, even if it should be, come necessary to kill Joseph Mac, Donald, the superintendent of the prop, erties, in order to accomplish that end., After many unsuccessful interviews j, with MacDonald, he began making, threats that he would kill MacDonld. j, These threats had been coinmuuicat- j, ed to MacDonald, who, after making, arrangements to have Jones arrested ?, for insanity, left Douglas and went j, to Skagway. While the latter was, away, Jones haunted the Treadwell, store and the grounds about the Mac, Donald house, awaiting for his return., The authorities failed to have him ar, rested, because they were awaiting for j, the return of MacDonald to sign the ;, complaint. On the morning of Mac, Donald\'s return, despite efforts that |, MacDonald made to escape him, the ;, two men met on the Treadwell plaza,, and the preponderance of testimony, was that Jones attacked and tried to, shoot MacDonald, who, in defense of, his life, shot Jones four times, once, in each arm and twice in the body., Jones died an hour and a half later., A coroner\'s jury, taking the testimony, on the day of the shooting, exonerat, td Mac Donald of blame. A grand, jury, sitting at Skagway the follow, ing October, upon which were men, from all sections of Southeastern Alas- j, ka, investigated the affair, and refused, to bring in an indictment. More than, ten years later, a grand jury sitting ?, at Juneau, indicted MacDonald, charg, ing him with murder in the first de, gree. MacDonald immediately did all, within his power to hasten the process, of extradition, expending a consider, able sum of money to that end, that, he might reach Juneau and stand trial., His friends, made during the four, years he resided in Alaska, came to, his aid from the four quarters of the, globe, and were here to testify for, him. Hellenthal and Hellenthal. the, Juneau lawyers, were employed to, manage the defense. They were after, wards joined by James M. Shoup, for, merly United States Marshal for Alas, ka, and later by former Senator, Samuel H. Piles, of Seattle. Notwith, standing that the government\'s case, was handled with remarkable skill and, acumen by District Attorney John, Rustgard and Assistant District At, torney Roy V. Nye, the testimony and, case of the defense developed into a, veritable stone wall, and the verdict, of the jury created no surprise among, those that had followed the proceed, ings., The Jury That Tried It., The jury that heard the evidence, and rendered the verdict was com, posed of men from various walks of, life, and it was agreed by all the par, ties to the proceedings that it was a, fair, intelligent and impartial tribunal., It was composed of Frank Harvey, E., V. Sherman, Fred Handy, J. S. Molloy,, Al. Rainier, A. J. Ficken, H. L. Dott,, A. H. Motte, J. Latimer Gray, C.ude, man Jensen, Grant A. Galdwin, and A., H. Smith., Al. Kaineir was selected by his fel, low jurrors for foreman, and handed, the verdict to the Clerk of the Court., Judge Brown\'s First Case., It was the first case to be tried by, Judge Fred M. Brown, and the attor, neys, jurors and court officials are, high in their praise of the manner he, conducted it., BROWN\'S INSTRUCTIONS, ARE VOLUMINOUS, Judge Fred M. Brown\'s instructions, to the jury in the MacDonald case, w?*re voluminousu, and covered every, phase of the evidence that was intro, duced, and the law bearing upon it., The courut instructed the jury that, it was the sole judge of the credibility, of the witnesses and the weight to be, given the testimony of each; that in, weighing evidence it must take into, account the interest of witnesses if, any for or against the defendant; and, the fact as to whether or not better, evidence than that introduced could, have been securued to prove any, point, if so it would -tend to discred, it the evidence produced: that the, jury is not bound to find with the pre, ALASKANS MISSING, VALUABLE ASSET, C. L. Andrews, who probably covered, more ground in Alaska in quest of in, formation concerning Northern Nature, than any other man living, believes, that the people of this Territory do, not give enough attention to the com, mercial value of their scenery. He, says a tithe of the scenery that we, have at our doors here would be coined, into money if it were located in some, other sections of the world. Speak, ing of this Alaska asset yesterday, Mr., Andrews said:, "The people in Juneau, and in fact,, those of the rest of Southeastern Alas, ka are too busy and too well paid at, other things to make money at those, things that prove a mine of wealth to, other places. This part of the world, is endowed with an inheritance of, mountain and stream and glacier that, will be a source of more wealth in the, aggregate perhaps than its immense, deposits of gold, and this wealth will, be distributed over more years and to, more people. When the Treadwell, mine is worked out and forgotten, there will be more returns from the, natural grandeur of this country than, there is toclay., "Southern California is eo poverty ;, stricken for scenery that she has to put, a railway up a mesquite covered moun, tain no higher and not nearly so rug, ged as Mt. Juneau to get the tourists, to go up and to spend their gold. They, certainly exploit what little scenery, they have down there. They adver, tise all over the world about a Hot, Spring, and show a cut of a slide in, a canyon that they call an \'Arrow- \', head.\', (Continued to Page Three.), o ? o ? o, FOUR INDICTMENTS FOR, WHISKEY PEDDLING TODAY, The grand jury reported five true, hills this morning and two not true., Of the seven cases inquired into six, were for violation of Section 142 of, the criminal code, to-wit: selling li, quor to Indians. Thqse indicted for, this offense were Lorenzo Sata, of, Douglas; Anna Johnson, (native) of, Chatham; August Anderson, of Sitka;, Hignazio Quesada, of Wrangell. Not, a true bill was returned for Dan Cam, eron, of Juneau, and Mrs. Jim Gose, Ka-Nak (Indian), of Chatham., ponderances of witnesses, but might, find with the lesser number if it be, lieves their testimony is more reas, onable or probable or that they had, better opportunity to know about what, they were testifying; that the, appearance and conduct of a witness, on the stand should be taken into ac, count; that remarks of counsel that, are foreign to the evidence should be, disregarded., The court explained that there are, two kinds of evidence, direct and cir, cumstantial, and that the latter when, well-connected may be as conclusive, as the former., witnesses May Be Disregarded., The court instructed the jury that, where it believed that a witness had, testified falsely in one thing it could, disregard his testimony entirely, but, that it is not bound to do so; that the, innocence of the defendant is pre, sumed until he is proved guilty beyond, all reasonable doubt, but that such, doubt must not be any doubt or a, mere whim; that the fact that an in, dictment was found does not raise any, presumption of guilt; that the fact that, the defendant did not introduce char, acter witnesses should not count, against him, because he is presumed, to be of good character; that the, to be of good character; that the great, interest of the defendant must be tak, en into account in weighing \'his evi, dence., Affirmative Testimony Preferred., The court instructed that affirmative, testimony is entitled to more weight, than negative. In other words, one, witness that said he saw or heard a, thing is entitled to more weight than, the testimony of several that did not, see or hear it., Jones\' Confessions Admissible., The court instructed that any state, ments made by Jones after he knew, that he was about to meet death are, entitled to the presumption of truth,, as the law presumes that he had no, further interest in the world or any, object to serve by falsifying., Self-Defense Recognized., The jury was instruced that the de, fendant had a right under the law to, kill Jonea if he had reasonable ground, to believe that the latter intended to, kill him or do him great bodily harm, and that it was the only reasonable re, sort for him to take to save himself, from death or bodily harm, but that, the defendant was not required to re, treat or run away, but permitted to, stand his ground and resist force with, force., (Continued on Page 4.), Seth Mann Takes Up, Alaska Land Matter, SEATTLE, July 31. ? Seth Mann,, the special representative of the Pres, ident with the recent Alaska excur, sion of the New Seattle Chamber of, Commerce, and Andrew Christensen,, chief of the field division of the Unit, ed States general land office, held an, extended conference yesterday In this, city. Christensen will confer with Sec, retary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, before proceeding to Alaska., Great Britian Will, Boycott Exposition, NEW YORK, July 31. ? A Washing, ton dispatch in the New York Times,, says that the British government has j, notified Walter H. Page, the American, ambassador, that Great Britain will, not participate in the Panama-Pacific, Exposition at San Francisco. The ac, tion ifi an expression of British resent, ment on account of the course of the, United States government in connec, tion with the Panama canal tolls., OLD SOURDOUGH, EROM NEW STRIKE, Hank Summers, who arrive a che, cliaco in Juneau, during the year 188b,, but parsed on to watershed of the, great Yukon during that same summer,, is again in Juneau having arrived from, Skagway. Mr. Summers has been in, the upper reaches of the White river, near the Shushana for the past several 1, mouths. He says that the Shushana, will turn out to be a great producer. ;, That section of the country in which, Mr. Summers has been since last April ;, is, he says, the greatest mineral belt, in the world. All kinds of minerals, abound. Gold is found both in plac, er and quartz. And there is lots of, it. The country needs transportation, facilities. The best way to reach the, country at the present time is by way, of Whitehorse. A good wagon road, leads from the latter place to Silver, creek, a tributary of Lake Kluane., From Silver creek to Kenyon on the, American side, a distance of 80 miles,, there is a good trail., There is mineral enough in sight, without any further development to, warrant the construtcion of a rail, road into the country. An ideal route, to that section would be by Haines and, the old Dalton trail, but at present it, is not feasible. There are at present !, about fifty people on the American, side of the White river country. The, Shushana diggings are but a short dis, tance from the section that has re, ceived the attention of Mr. Summers, for the past several months. He is, going back via Whitehorse in a few, days. Mr. Summers thinks that this, route is also the best into the Shu, shana., GETS FIFTY DAYS FOR, KILLING FEMALE MOOSE, In a letter to the Governor\'s office, relative to game conditions in the Ke, nai peninsula, the senior game war, den at. Seward says: "The case I had, pending against King Thurman was, brought up some days ago and he was, fined $150.00 or 50 days for killing a, female moose out of season. He is, now serving the 50 days.", The conviction of King Thurman, will meet with the hearty approval, of all law-abiding citizen of Kenai pen, insula, as he has been a notorious vio, lator of the game law. His operations, were carried on in such a way that, it was only after repeated efforts on, the part of the game warden that he, was apprehended, the game warden, finaly catching him "with the goods.", Another man against whom numerous, complaints have been made from time, to time fled the country as soon as, he learned- of the arrest of Thurman, and he has not been seen or heard, from since., o ? o ? o, RAZOR WIELDER INDICTED, FOR ASSAULT ON HANSON, The grand jury this morning re, turned an indictment against D. G., Clark charging the crime of assault, with a dangerous weapon., It is alelged that Clark atacked, Chris Hanson with a razor in Handle\'s, place of business last January and, that the latter was slashed across the, hand with the weapon. Clark has, been in jail waiting for indictment and, trial ever since his arrest at the time, of the assault., o ? o ? o, LOST ?

They want the United, States to take charge of affairs down there, .not to vindicate any priciple,, but to terminate turbulent conditions that are interfering with business., It is a question of dollars with them., The administration has made it plain that the lives, liberties and rights, of Americans in Mexico will be protected to the uttermost, but those mat, ters that are political and concern the Mexican people will be left to the, Mexicans to regulate in their own way so long as Americans are not wrong, fully interfered with., The Mexican situation and America\'s duties and attitude in the prem, ises are well set forth by the New York World in this wise:, "What Europe wants in Mexico is precisely what our jingoes, want. It is not specially interested in the recognition by our C.ov, erniuent of the lluerta regime, but for obvious reasons it would, like to have the United States occupy the country at any cost, and restore peace., "Confronted recently by a similar difficulty south of the Danube,, it is noticeable that Europe has not acted upon its own instructions., In 1903, when the King and Queen of Servia were assassinated,, Europe was in no haste to recognize their guilty successors. One, great power waited three years., "The existing Government in Mexico has no sanction of law,, of popular will or even of force. It owes everything to murder., When it took the life of Madero it also suppressed the Constitution., It has little authority at any distance from the scene of its crimes., "By refusing to be goaded into hasty action beyond the Rio, Grande the administration has exhibited wisdom of a high order., Its responsibilities are great, but it has met them ably and courage, ously. Had as conditions are, rashness on our part might easily, make them infinitely worse for ourselves and Europe also., "Mexico is working out its own problems in blood, in suffer, ing. in humiliation. It will have a sort of election in October, the re, sult of which may justify a change of policy on our part. In the, meantime there is no call for intervention and there is nothing in, the Monroe Doctrine that obliges us to make war in response to, the pressure of anybody.", Yesterday was a great day with the Mac Donald family. Joseph Mac, aid was freed by a jury at Juneau and Bernard MacDonald, his brother,, was released from a Mexican military arrest by order of President Huerta., THE VINDICATION OF MACDONALD, THE trial of Joseph MacDonald was fairly and brilliantly conducted be, fore an able and upright court and an intelligent and unbiased jury., The truth concerning the Treadwell tragedy of long ago has been, given to the world, and there is noue that can say again that justice has, been defrauded. Joseph MacDouald goes forth among his fellows stainless, and without reproach, and there is none to question his right to the vindica, tion that is his., There is in the community a natural feeling of satisfaction that a man, who had been charged with crime has been able to establish his innocence, of wrongdoing. It is a good thing that such feeling exists, because it is, evidence of the existence of the right sort of spirit among the men and, women that constitute it. It is pleasant to know that the people of this, section of Alaska can think and speak of Joseph MacDonald as a former, citizen of commanding prominence, who has been identified in a big way with, its development and in making its resources known to the world, and have, no apology to offer to any one for so thinking and so speaking., Charles F. Marvin is to have charge of our weather in the future.

Every, year tourists run all over the world, with money to burn, and beg enter, prising people to take it for amus, ing them., "John Muir sad, \'Alaska has a hun, dred Yosemites.\' He spoke truly, yet, 110 one ever hears of them., "Go to Southern California and take, the kite-shaped track out to the San, Bernardino valley and at Kedlands., They will be waiting with coaches and, autos to haul you up Smiley heights, where you see a sand and sagebrush, desert on one hand and a lemon, grove on the other. The tourist pays, the price, is amused, and Enjoys it., "When tourists come to Juneau and, asks \'What is there to see?\' \'Aw,, nothing worth while,\' is the answer, : of the average person. There are no, autos or coaches waiting to take them, for a drive over the government road, to the Mendenhall glacier, a larger gla, cier than Switzerland affords and gath, ers in good American money from our, | tourists for viewing., "In California you are importuned, to go to Avalon and ride in the glass, bottomed boats and see the wonderful, forms in the ocean water. You go and, 1 line the cash boxes of the transporta, tion company and the residents of San, ta Catalina Islands with your big dol, lars., "Hi re is Sitka with a thousand times !, more beauty than Avalon, and fish,, and sponges, and coral, and beautiful I, sea forms in the clear ocean water,, but no one offers a row boat to go out, to see them let alone a glass-bottomed, one., "Some day someone will wake up, and make good money out of the pro, fusion of beauty about Juneau, if the |, transportation companies will arrange, to give tourists the chance to stay, long enough to see things., "Keep the tourists long enough to, show them something and give them, | their money\'s worth. The value is, 1 here. You do not need to try to skin, i them, there is no need of any bunco, | game. There is enough of really beau, tifgul things to give value received for, every day the traveler stays with you., He has come from one to four thous, and miles to see things and be amused., Why disappoint him when you have, so much., "If Los Angeles had the Silver Bow, I basin, or the Sheep creek basin, with, ; its jewel of a glacier clinging to the, , mountain at the south, or the Menden, j hall Glacier, she would make millions \\, ; out of it., "At Juneau not one in ten of the -, resident population even knows where (, Mendenhall is, and the tourist who, visits it is a wonder. An hour\'s ride, in an auto along a good road puts one ., at the front of a greater glacier than, is in Switzerland. You can ride to, the front of It and ten minutes\' walk, puts you right on the ice where you, can look into its crevasses. A river \', bursts from its front, plunges over a, \' rock rampart into a great basin of, rock and tumbles away over the mor, aine to the sea. A great power plant, stands within a stone\'s throw of tke, ice-front. A short climb on a trail, along the mountain through a forest, of spruce and hemlock, the open spaces, | bordered with mountain flowers, brings, you to Lookout Point from where you, look out on the stream of ice six -hun, dred feet below and down the val, ley to the inlet of the ocean. On the, way, at the lower part of the valley is, as fine a dairy as the average of those, of the famous Skagit River valley,, and it is in as picturesque a setting, as are the beautiful saeters, or moun, tain dairies of Norway, or the Swiss, dairies where the world famous cheese \', of the olfl world is made. j, "How many residents of Juneau have I, j ever seen it?"
