This contrasts with the Cold War period, \nwhen Sweden and Finland were neutral, and Norway and Denmark put self-imposed restraints \non their NATO memberships. Providing Northern Europe with a stable “buffer” between East \nand West, this so-called Nordic balance kept the United States and Soviet Union at an arm’s \nlength. Since 2014 however, Northern Europe has de facto slid from “buffer” to “springboard” for \nUS forces. This slide may counter Russian assertiveness, but there is also reason to argue that it \nmay increase regional tension and unpredictability. If so, this may leave the entire region with less \nrather than more security.\xa0Using the case of Norway, it is argued that too close an alignment with \nNATO may have accelerated Norway’s role as a “springboard” for US forces. This is because cost- \nintensive reforms needed to accommodate US expectations abroad have also exacerbated critical \nvulnerabilities at home. Increased dependency on US forces thereby makes difficult the balance \nbetween deterrence and restraint vis-à-vis Russia. \nKeywords: Security; military; Norway; Russia; United States; NATO; Sweden; Finland.\nResponsible Editor: Øyvind Ravna, UiT – The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, \nNorway\nReceived: March 2018; Accepted: November 2018; Published: December 2018 \n1. Introduction \nUsing the case of Norway, this article explores how Northern Europe can respond \nto Russian aggression without creating a security dilemma on their doorstep.1 Since \nRussia’s war against Georgia in 2008 and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, Sweden, \n', 'Tormod Heier\n268\nFinland, Poland, Germany and the Baltic states have been exposed to military \nrearmament, hostile intelligence gathering, and considerable power rivalry. This is \nmainly due to a deteriorating security situation in the Baltic Sea Region, where the \nUnited States and 19 other NATO members have deployed four multinational battlegroups\nto Poland and the Baltic states. As one of the most contentious regions in \nEurope, Russia argues that the presence of the US and NATO significantly reduces \nits strategic warning time.2 This has put Russian commands in Murmansk and \nSt. Petersburg, and their subordinate fleets in the Barents and Baltic Seas, on high \nalert, and subsequently legitimised unexpected ‘snap exercises’, dangerous brinkmanship\nand violations of Swedish and Finish airspace on the part of Russia.\nFrom a US perspective, however, military firmness is meant to stabilise the region, \npartly by deepening military cooperation with Sweden and Finland because the \nNordic territories provide US forces with a ‘strategic depth’ that makes regional \ndeterrence more credible;3 and partly by deploying a tripwire of approximately 4500 \nNATO-troops from 20 member states along the Russian border to communicate \nresolve if the sovereignty of Poland, Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania is violated. \nThis “tit-for-tat” logic has spurred a new security dilemma in Northern Europe. \nIronically, it leaves all the involved states and their inhabitants with less, rather than \nmore security. How the two non-alignment states of Sweden and Finland, which \nare “trapped between neutrality and NATO”4 respond to this situation, will be a \nsignificant determinant in shaping the regional security situation. The core challenge \nseems to revolve around a typical rim state dilemma: How can we deter Russia while \nkeeping a non-provocative posture? This dilemma became more acute after Russian \nforces twice violated Georgian and Ukrainian sovereignty in 2008 and 2014, raising \nquestions about who would be next. In particular, subtle efforts to pursue political \nobjectives through a spectre of military and non-military instruments in Ukraine, \nGeorgia and the Baltic states has fuelled Western mistrust. \nThis anxiety has been exacerbated by Russia’s forward deployment of S-400 \nsurface-to-air missiles and nuclear-capable missile systems to Kaliningrad, and by \nRussian jets occasionally flying dangerously close to civilian and military aircraft and \nvessels in the Baltic Sea.5 Russia’s offering Eurosceptic parties in Western Europe \ncooperation, loans, political cover and propaganda has added to this, as have findings \nfrom the United States’ Senate Committee on Intelligence, claiming that Russian \ncyber operations towards the US presidential election in 2016 “… were more extensive\nthan the hack of the Democratic National Committee…”6\nManaging tension can partly be achieved by tying US forces closer to Northern \nEuropean defence arrangements, as in Sweden and Finland’s Host Nation Support \narrangements with NATO and the US.7 It can also be done through a show of military \nforce, as in the exercises carried out with nuclear-capable B 52H bombers and more \nthan 100 western jetfighters not far from the Russian border.8 This kind of political \ncommunication signals deterrence, which is a way of scaring Russia into believing that \npotential costs will rapidly outweigh expected benefits if armed conflict breaks out. \n', 'Avoiding War\n269\nThe smaller states of Northern Europe therefore seem to emphasise deterrence over \nrestraint. This strategy is not from a position of strength. Arguably, it stems from a \nposition of weakness deeply rooted in national shortcomings not least inside Sweden’s \nArmed Forces.9 The extent and tempo at which Sweden and Finland abandoned their \nrole as buffer states between East and West is of an unprecedented magnitude.10 From \ntheir role as a stabilising bridge between the Soviet Union and the United States during \nthe Cold War, Sweden and Finland are – together with the previously sceptical NATO \nmembers Norway and Denmark – increasingly becoming key actors in a geopolitical \nstandoff between the United States and Russia in Northern Europe. \nIn order to discuss how Northern Europe should respond to Russian aggression, \nthis article uses Norway as a case. By scrutinising Norway’s experience between \n1998 and 2018, the article first describes NATO’s effect on Norwegian security \nand defence policy. Thereafter, NATO alignment is viewed in relation to Norway’s \ncontemporary policy towards Russia. Finally, three implications with relevance to \nNorthern Europe are deduced, with a particular emphasis on Sweden and Finland. \nThis approach allows us to analyse Norther Europe’s security problem from a new \nangle: Rather than focusing on Russian assertiveness, the focus here is on Norway’s \nalliance management. The key finding is that Norwegian alignment with NATO has \nenergised its dependence on the US through Norway’s attempts to be “a good ally” \nand “best-in-class”. Loyal fulfilment of cost-intensive reforms for ‘out-of-area’ operations\nhas led to chronic shortages of manpower, spare parts, and logistics at home. \nThe implications of this is a national force that is more inclined to escalate minor \ncrises with Russia. If not, a bilateral fait accompli may occur before US reinforcements\narrive. Time has become a critical factor. This logic provides grim prospects \nfor regional diplomatic relations with Russia. As Sweden and Finland slide towards \nthe West, this situation deserves attention.\nThe findings, which are put forward later in the text, are important. They bring \nto the table broader security implications that go beyond positive assumptions of \na “Swedish policy of deterrence”, as presented by Fredrik Westerlund in 2017.11 \nHis well-crafted analysis should nevertheless be balanced by the importance of self- \nimposed restraints and assurances towards Russia. Changing Russia’s behaviour \ncannot be achieved by threatening behaviour only. Crisis-management mechanisms \nincentivising confidence, cooperation and compromise are also needed. Here, Robert \nDalsjø and Thomas Hultmark provide valuable insight into how “the carrot and the \nstick” needs to be balanced if Russia is to change its behaviour. Unfortunately, “a \nmore offensive and proactive stance to the more traditional reactive and reticent tools” \nis currently emphasised,12 and the crucial imperative of how to balance escalation \nwith restraint is omitted from the discourse. Coupled with strategic guidelines from \nSweden’s Military-Strategic Doctrine 2016, which claims that crises should be addressed \nmore offensively,13 a competitive zero-sum logic seems to be more important \nthan providing security gains for Sweden, Finland and Russia. First, however, the art \nof alliance management needs to be explained theoretically. \n', 'Tormod Heier\n270\n2. Alliance Theory\nOne way to comprehend the impact of alliances is to describe small states’ motives \nfor membership. Stephen M. Walt’s authoritative definition of alliances as “a formal \nor informal relationship between two or more sovereign states” is most commonly \nused.14 In our context however, this definition is too wide because Sweden and \nFinland are not NATO-members. As pointed out by Stein Rynning and Oliver \nSchmitt, it fails to grasp the fluid boundaries between formal allies, strategic partners,\nand like-minded friends. Defining alliances as “a formal or informal association \nof states for the (threat of) use of military force, in specified circumstances, against \nactors external to the alliance” is more appropriate.15 While elaborating on the Norwegian\ncase, it allows us to keep two of NATO’s most valuable partners in mind.\nOf particular interest is the impact of alliances in war. In other words, will alliance \nmembership make member states more secure, or less secure against a neighbouring \nstate’s military aggression? Most often, small states prefer alliances in order to balance\na potential adversary. This is particularly so if adversaries are positioned along \nyour border because such a deployment may pose an imminent threat if it serves \nthe adversary’s interest.16 However, smaller states may also choose to bandwagon \nin order to “secure strategic gains despite their material disadvantage”.17 This may \ninclude self-imposed restraints that are meant to preclude provocation and suspiciousness.\nBut no matter what a minor client state chooses, they will always have \nto address the perennial risk of being abandoned by their patron. This threat is also \nshared by the patron, which – according to Glenn Snyder’s Alliance Politics – may \nbecome entrapped in wars initiated by a client state’s fear of being abandoned.18 \nFrom a small state perspective therefore, alliance management is very much about \nbalancing between a policy of invitation and a policy of restraint.19 To get “a hook in \nthe nose” of a larger patron will inevitably equalise local power asymmetry vis-à-vis \nan assertive neighbour, thus providing a strong incentive to balance against the most \ndangerous threat.20 But inviting allies may also cause unnecessary and excessive \npower rivalry and militarisation on the client’s territory. Such a situation may easily \ninduce a spiral of tension and mistrust, which again ends up in a security dilemma \nwhere all states – large and small – become less secure rather than more.21 A certain \ndegree of bandwagoning towards potential adversaries may therefore be necessary, \nnot least to preclude suspiciousness from neighbours who are easily provoked.\nIn theory as in practice therefore, finding the right balance between “the carrot and \nthe stick” is difficult. This is particularly so when the client needs the patron more \nthan the other way around. Smaller states that depend upon foreign aid are more \nanxious of being marginalised, which is why they often put aside myopic national \ninterests for the sake of a common good together with the patron. Being perceived as \na “free-rider” would be detrimental, as egoistic behaviour undermines the ties that \nbind larger and smaller states together in a common destiny. As a sign of obedience \nand loyalty therefore, clients are more inclined to accommodate allied injunctions \n', 'Avoiding War\n271\nset forth by its patron. This may ultimately foster a shared sense of mutual respect, \nrecognition and reciprocity for each other’s security needs. It may even provide the \nclient with more attention and access to the patron’s ear. This is why, according to \nWalt, smaller states seek alliances with a larger state.\nAs seen from an external neighbour’s perspective, this kind of alliance management \nis not without problems. This is because a client’s benevolence towards its patron also \nleads to a shift in the local balance of power. The client will therefore have a common \ninterest with the suspicious neighbour in keeping the level of militarisation as low as \npossible, almost as “a secret pact”.22 But at the same time, obedience to a patron’s \nexpectations also needs to be displayed through firm commitments. Because of this, \nclients easily end up in situations where the patron becomes increasingly influential. \nDependency on the patron therefore makes it difficult to balance between allied \nexpectations and assurances towards an (increasingly) suspicious neighbour. \nThis may ultimately lead to a change in the security strategy of the small state. \nRather than focusing on absolute security for the small state and its neighbour, ‘security’\nbecomes an indivisible asset in a ‘relative zero-sum game’, with the client and \npatron situated on one side, and an increasingly assertive neighbour on the other. \nBased on these theoretical assumptions, it is likely that Norway’s alliance management\nin NATO is characterised by a constant fear of US abandonment. This anxi-\nety is a primary motive for gaining as much security as possible through a strategy \nof accommodation in NATO. Even though this may stir increased Russian apprehension,\nthe unilateral quest for Norwegian security nevertheless invokes a stronger \nincentive for being perceived as “a good ally”. This logic can be operationalised into \nfour indicators. Put into a Norwegian context, the practical expression of this would \nbe a constant striving for (1) attention and (2) access to decision making bodies in \nthe US and NATO, and incentives for (3) loyalty and (4) obedience inside these \ninstitutional bodies. \n3. NATO’s Effect on Norway\nSince the early 1990s, NATO has been instrumental in America’s efforts to reform \nEuropean forces into more deployable and combat-ready units that can sustain and \nprotect themselves in ‘out-of-area’ operations.23 Of particular importance are expeditionary\nqualities such as strategic deployability, tactical mobility and high readiness. \nThese qualities have been pursued through various NATO defence programmes, \nsuch as Defence Capability Initiative (1998), Prague Capability Commitment (2002), \nSmart Defence (2011), and Connected Forces Initiative (2012). They are a programmatic\nexpression of US expectations set forth by the Pentagon towards NATO cli-\nents in Europe. Throughout the 1990s and well into the new millennium, Norway \nhas pursued an active downscaling and force reduction at home in order to reallocate \nresources for new investments. The rationale is, according to the Norwegian Ministry \nof Defence, based upon expectations of US assistance against Russia: “International \n', 'Tormod Heier\n272\noperations in an allied framework is an investment which is meant to ensure that also \nNorway receives allied reinforcements if we need it”.24\n3.1 Attention\nBy actively accommodating the defence programmes above, Norway has increased \nits ability to share risks and burdens abroad. However, shifting from quantity to \nquality has also accelerated the financial imbalance between operating costs and new \ninvestments at home.25 Meeting US expectations in NATO is nevertheless regarded \nas more important than maintaining a larger, more sustainable but less sophisticated \nforce for self-help and territorial border defence only, a post-Cold War logic in effect \nwhen Russia was still seen as a partner in Northern Europe, until 2006–2007. \nReducing military capacity, even at the lower end of the conflict spectrum, is a \nstrong symbol of NATO adjustment. Norway’s response can therefore be seen as an \neffort to keep US leadership and interests alive in Europe, which during the 1990s \ninvolved burden and risk sharing in the Balkans. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks \nin 2001, this has spiralled into a global commitment of accommodating US security\nrequirements in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mali, Libya and Niger, as well as in \nthe Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. US discontent with its European allies, \nuttered through statements such as those made by senior Congress members following\n9/11, made a particular impression: \nSome Americans have lost confidence in the Alliance. Years of cuts in defense spending and \nfailure to meet pledge after pledge to improve European military capabilities has left some \nAmericans with doubts as to what our allies could realistically contribute …. The US did have \nconfidence in a selected group of allies [following NATO’s response to 9/11]. But it did not \nhave confidence in the institution that is NATO.26\nBy constructively participating in US led efforts to pool European defence resources, \nNorway stands forth as an example of how to manage allied obligations. Since the \ninauguration of NATO’s Defence Capability Initiative, the ambition to ensure US \nrelevancy has been of paramount importance. According to former Defence Minister\n(2001–2005) Kristin Krohn Devold, “To reach this goal, it is important for \nNorway to be among ‘the best in the NATO class’. That is crucial for being counted \non”.27 Examples of this are found in Norwegian Special Forces’ assignments to mentor\nlocal security forces and militias in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan and Syria, which \ngained positive attention in the United States. Even more attention was gained by \nthe sophisticated signal intelligence provided to US and Coalition forces during \ncounterterrorist operations in ISAF (2003–2014), and by the risky air raids carried \nout on Muammar Gadhafi’s command centre in densely populated Tripoli during \nthe 2011 Libyan war.28 Receiving positive credentials from US Congress members, \nsuch as “Best-in-class” and Gold star”, is crucial for a small state that needs to nurture\nties to a larger patron.29\n', 'Avoiding War\n273\n3.2 Access\nNorway’s alliance management in NATO also makes it easier to access US decision-making\nprocesses. Working from within cooperative processes rather than from \nthe outside, Norway’s national security interests can be voiced more clearly. The \nlogic is simple but effective: By adapting to US expeditionary requirements abroad, \nNorwegian defence officials have been elevated into processes dominated by its key \nsecurity provider, which is also the world’s sole military superpower. Because Norway \ncan deliver relevant capabilities that the United States needs in Central Asia or in \nthe Middle East, Norwegian politicians and civil servants are given access to key \npolicymakers in the White House, Pentagon and State Department, or even to the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, as was the case when Norwegian Prime \nMinister Erna Solberg’s visited President Donald Trump in January 2018.30 Such \nevents enable clients to cultivate policymakers and decision makers from within, not \nleast patrons who – through Norwegian surveillance of Russian strategic submarines \n– are directly related to US security interests in Northern Europe. \nThe quest for access is consistent with comments made by former US Ambassador \nto NATO (2001–2005), Nicholas Burns. His claim that “Norway is a country that \n‘punches above its weight’ – meaning it is a country that has an influence beyond the \nsize of the country itself”,31 was largely because Norway deployed Special Forces to \nAfghanistan at an early stage after 9/11.32 The same recognition was also reiterated \nin 2016 when Defence Secretary (2015–2017) Ashton Carter praised Norway for its \nmilitary reforms, and its valuable contribution in the “war against the Islamic State \nin Syria”. Following the Secretary, the Norwegian Defence Minister \n… was part of a core group of members that I convened last year from the counter-ISIL \ncoalition… Norway is taking seriously the challenges of this area and adapting its armed forces. \nThe United States appreciates this commitment and stands by [Norway] to assist in any way \nwe can.33 \nUsing NATO to enhance Norway’s access to key US decision makers is also confirmed\nby defence officials in the Pentagon. As Europe’s military transformation \ngained momentum after 9/11, officials from the Pentagon’s Office of the Secretary \nof Defence claimed that Norway, due to its positive attitude, enjoyed “tremendous \naccess to decision-making processes, not only in the Pentagon, but also in the State \nDepartment. A major part of this is due to your excellent reputation, particularly as \na proactive country that takes transformation seriously”.34 \nNorwegian benevolence towards US preferences is not a new approach. As pointed \nout by the two historians Rolf Tamnes and Knut Einar Eriksen, during the Cold War \n“… an important guidance in the Norwegian alliance policy was to seek influence \nby demonstrating a deliberate intention to co-operate”.35 Spectacular events, such \nas the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, the effort to protect Libyan \ncivilians in 2011, or counter the Islamic State’s rapid expansion in 2014, are typical \n', 'Tormod Heier\n274\n“windows of opportunities” to display, confirm and consolidate long-standing ties \nwith the preeminent security provider against Russia.\n3.3 Loyalty\nFearing US abandonment in Northern Europe, Norway’s alliance management is \nalso incentivised by loyalty. By firmly supporting US proposals concerning how \nNATO-Europe may improve its scarce defence resources more effectively, Norway \nis able to undertake a constructive role in any consultation with US defence officials. \nOn this basis, a more effective approach towards joint, common and multinational \ndefence planning – and acquisition of increasingly expensive capabilities – can proceed.\nThe outcome is potentially far larger than Norway, which spends 1.6 per cent \nof its GDP on defence, can afford alone. Norway’s long-term security motive is to \nmaintain and strengthen bilateral ties with the US, as this makes it easier to balance\nRussia in the High North. Issue linkages between US injunctions on NATO’s \ndefence programmes, burden sharing abroad, and critique of Russia, thereby explain \nmuch of Norway’s loyalty. Given Norway’s dependency on US forces, efforts to \nrefine a common set of security interests across the Atlantic gives more security \nthan pursuing myopic interests alone. The alternative of forging a territorial force \nwill only have grave repercussions; US reciprocity in Northern Europe will neither \nbe institutionalised nor revitalised if Norway becomes irrelevant to US security concerns\nabroad.36\nLoyalty is even more important as NATO’s defence programmes are launched \nby Norway’s closest ally. Uncertainty as to where the Trump administration may \ngo in international politics makes a committed posture even more important.37 A \nconstructive approach thereby signifies Norwegian commitment to keeping NATO \nrelevant. A dispiriting “two-tier NATO”, or even a more “fragmented NATO”, 38 \ncould involve a dysfunctional division of labour that ultimately makes the Alliance \nless credible in Northern Europe. As Krohn Devold pointed out to the Norwegian\nChief of Defence in 2002, “NATO […] is our primary point of reference. \nAny national capability that does not have a function abroad is to be given low \npriority”.39 Norwegian investments that provide for this flexibility have been a key \nimperative ever since. Fearing prospects of political and military marginalisation, it \nis crucial that Norway and the rest of NATO-Europe, according to Defence Minister\n(2013–2017) Ine M. Eriksen Søreide, “[looks] beyond its own borders in order \nto take co-responsibility for global security” – as “credible US engagement and \nleadership is vital”.40\n3.4 Obedience\nObedience to US injunctions has also allowed Norway to give up keeping a balanced \nforce without exposing national security to intolerable risks. From being able to \nmobilise more than 400,000 troops from the civil society during the Cold War,41 the \n', 'Avoiding War\n275\npresent force structure consists of approximately 12,000 uniformed and 5,300 civilian\npersonnel. The dramatic downsizing incentivises Norway to harmonise and inte-\ngrate its defence plans with the United States inside the NATO-framework. In order \nto cope with declining defence budgets and escalating costs on more deployable \ntroops, Norway obediently renounces a more sustainable force that otherwise would \nhave provided national authorities more resilience in Northern Europe. Hence, collective\narrangements in NATO also make it easier to change procurement policies \ntowards increased role specialisation, e.g. on Special Forces, signal intelligence, submarines\nand maritime patrol aircraft. \nAccording to Norwegian defence officials, this was one of the key reasons why \nNorway gave up its balanced force structure in the 1990s: “Even though the American \nDefence Capability Initiative would make a balanced force structure hard to maintain,\nit would at least enhance mutual trust and confidence”.42 Obedience to allied \ninjunctions is as such an important institutional mechanism that makes NATO a \nunique institution, and upon which small states like Norway are investing an increasingly\nlarge part of their security. By relating alliance management to issues of more \nfar-reaching concern, such as the US drift from Europe, abstaining military capacities\neven in the lower end of the conflict spectrum is a necessary or even inevitable \nsacrifice.\n4. Empirical findings from Norway\nBased upon the four indicators from alliance theory, two conclusions can be deduced. \nFirst, NATO membership has made it both politically legitimate and militarily feasible\nto downsize, rationalise and abnegate territorial defence in order to finance \nexpeditionary forces. This was particularly so up to 2006–2007, when Russia was \nstill seen as a partner and friend. Even though prioritising quality over quantity \nhas increased Norway’s military vulnerability vis-à-vis Russia, and even though US \nexpectations of burden-sharing in Central Asia and the Middle East have accelerated \nthe imbalance between operating costs and investments, being “a good ally” has \nexalted Norway’s status in the United States.43 Norway’s inability to address even \nminor crises in the lower end of the conflict spectrum is therefore seen as a calculated\nrisk, but with one serious implication: Even at an early stage in a potentially \ntense situation with Russia, rapid deployment of US forces is imperative. \nSecondly, Norwegian alignment with NATO’s reforms has reduced Norway’s \ndiplomatic room for manoeuvre. Whereas Norway’s territorial force from the 1980s \nwas expected to pursue defensive delay operations for more than eight weeks, the \npresent force is unlikely to operate efficiently for more than a few days. This means \nthat Norwegian diplomats have little time to solve crises, tensions or address bilateral\nmisperceptions before the military command structure and its subordinate \nair, land and sea units start to deteriorate. Delegating national defence tasks to an \nalliance that consists of 29 very different nations, and where NATO’s command \n', 'Tormod Heier\n276\nstructure also suffers from serious inadequacies, thereby makes it riskier to underscore\ndiplomatic efforts with national forces in the High North. If minor conflicts \narise on NATO’s northern flank, Norway will not be able to fortify diplomatic dialogue\nwith an adequate military force, because the military will immediately start \nto disintegrate. \nHow does this weakness affect Norway’s strategy towards Russia?\n5. Implications of Norway’s policy towards Russia \nNorwegian willing compliance with allied injunctions has contributed to making \nNorway a “small middle power” in Europe.44 This is because NATO guidance has \nhelped Norway stir a military transformation that has channelled scarce resources \nfrom a large mobilisation force into a more agile professional force. Despite a lack \nof sustainability however, prospects for more permanent US reinforcements – seen \nsince 2014 – have to some extent eased Norwegian apprehensions. This is particularly\nso as Russian “snap exercises” and cyberattacks towards critical infrastructure \nhave increased over the past few years.45 Burden sharing in Afghanistan, Iraq and \nSyria, as well as intensified intelligence gathering towards Russia’s Northern Fleet \nhave nevertheless cemented transatlantic ties. This logic has long roots in Norwegian\nstrategic thinking. According to Defence Minister (1986–1989) Johan Jørgen \nHolst, a potential crisis with Russia should not end up as a war with Norway, but \nrather as a war about Norway.46 Burden sharing abroad would make it easier to get \nUS attention and support if a Norwegian tripwire needed to be triggered in the High \nNorth. This burden sharing takes place in part through military channels in the \nNorwegian Intelligence Service, as well as in various parts of the Navy, Air Force \nand Special Forces commands, which on a daily basis operate closely with US forces \nin the United States, Norway, Belgium, Germany, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab \nEmirates. It also occurs through Norway’s extensive diplomatic networks embodied \nin the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs, which on a daily basis cultivates US \nties in Washington D.C., Brussels and London.47 Norway’s fears of abandonment \nby NATO have been allayed, in accordance with Snyder’s theoretical assumptions.\nIn addition, these networks can be interpreted as a sort of deterrence towards \nRussia. A more visible US presence in Norwegian airspace and territorial waters, \nas well as in the northern counties of Finnmark, Troms and Trøndelag underscores\na more credible US deterrent component in Northern Europe. Combined \nwith updated reinforcement and readiness plans, as well as more allied exercises, \nthis enhanced NATO presence sends the signal to Russia that Norwegian and US \nsecurity are inseparable, at least in theory. The credibility of this claim is further \nseen through a softening of previously self-imposed restraints, such as restrictions \non allied bases and exercises closer to Russia’s second strike capability on the Kola \nPeninsula. Other examples are found in the US Marine Corps’ presence on a rotational\nbasis in Mid-Norway,48 high intensity combat exercises in Finnmark county \n', 'Avoiding War\n277\nwith extensive US participation,49 new infrastructure for US Air Forces in southeast \nNorway, and new facilities for the US ground forces in Troms county.50 These developments\nare consistent with Walt’s expectation of a small state’s balancing behaviour \ntowards an assertive neighbour. \nCoupled with more security arrangements between Sweden, Finland, the US and \nNATO, Norway’s renewed “policy of invitation” has tied US commitments more \nexplicitly to the Nordic states’ national security concerns. Vulnerable states on Russia’s\nborder are assured, while the United States gets a firmer grip on the geopolit-\nical challenge of providing Baltic NATO allies with credible reinforcements while \npreventing Russian submarines and aircraft access to the North Atlantic. Lifting \nthe Cold War’s self-imposed restraints can be interpreted as a way of compensating\nfor the abnegation of a sustainable territorial force, which during the 1980s \nenabled Norway to solve national episodes, incidents and crises alone – and even \nsustain national operations for more than four weeks.51 The contemporary absence \nof trimmed and well-functioning command structure in NATO increases the validity \nof this perspective.52\n5.1 The Disadvantage of Allied Compliance\nRelinquishing an adequate defence in the lower end of the conflict spectrum has \nlong-term implications. The most serious but often neglected side effect is that Norwegian\nforces have become more inclined to pursue a more robust combat posture \ncloser to Russia’s border. This means that deterrence is favoured before restraint; the \n“stick” becomes more important than the “carrot”. Minor bilateral events, episodes \nand crises are more likely to escalate than de-escalate, at least up to the point where \nRussian forces consider withdrawing out of fear of possible US involvement. How \ncan this slide towards a more robust combat posture be explained? \nPropensities to go on the offensive are closely linked to inadequate sustainability, \nwhich is a key characteristic for smaller allies that have undergone a cost-intensive\ntransformation in NATO. Lack of volume and sustainability therefore makes \nit more rational to communicate resolve and combat agility. This is because a decisive\noutcome becomes critically important on short notice – preferably within a few \ndays. The alternative, which would be a prolonged and indecisive situation, would \ninstantly stir operative deterioration and a subsequent collapse before a clear political\noutcome has been reached. This is because troops that are put on a ‘24–7’ alert \nstatus face grave problems in sustaining agility without the constant support of sufficient\nlogistics, maintenance and extra troops. \nAmbiguous incidents, episodes or crises that are neither proper war nor proper \npeace, but something in between, may thereby reduce prospects for rapid assistance, \nand may ultimately lead to a diplomatic fait accompli where Norway ends up in a \nbilateral crisis with Russia before a US tripwire has been activated. This would complicate\nthe Norwegian Armed Forces’ strategy, which – in the wording of former \n', 'Tormod Heier\n278\nChief of Defence (2005–2009) General Sverre Diesen – is as follows: faced with “… \na limited military provocation, Norwegian forces must […] create a conflict which \nis so intense that our allies, due to reasons of national and collective credibility, are \nforced to get involved”.53 \nBy default, then, Norwegian forces might be forced to pursue an aggressive \n“deterrence by punishment” 54 strategy in situations where disputes could be solved \ndiplomatically with more patience, and a more cautious modus operandi. Maintaining \na more agile force closer to Russia’s border counteracts a defensive posture, which \nduring the Cold War was accomplished by a strategy labelled “deterrence by denial” \nin Troms county, approximately 1000 kilometres from the Russian border.55 \nNorway’s slide towards a more agile posture is underscored by empirical evidence \nfrom the Norwegian Defence Concept. Since 2012, the threshold defence concept \nhas emphasised deterrence rather than assurance towards Russia.56 By rapidly raising\nthe costs of aggression, scaring Russia from assertive action has become more \nimportant than pursuing self-restraints as a means of building confidence. Moving\nmore forces closer to the Northern Fleet thereby challenges Norway’s previous \nself-imposed restraints codified in limitations on US exercises in Finnmark, or US \nbases in Trøndelag and Troms in peacetime.57 During the Cold War, keeping military \nforces further away from the border provided both Russia and Norway with longer \nstrategic warning time.58 As these restraints have been removed, Norway’s strategy \ntowards Russia has also evolved. From following a logic of absolute security for both \nstates during the Cold War, which according to Johan Jørgen Holst was called “a \nsilent cooperation”,59 the contemporary strategy seems to emphasise relative security \nfor Norway at the expense of Russia. More emphasis on this kind of ‘zero-sum’ logic \nis also found in the political rhetoric of the Stoltenberg-II (2009–2013) and the \nSolberg Governments (2013–).60 Empirical evidence is also found in the conceptual \nidea of Threshold defence,61 as well as in the pattern of contemporary joint exercises. \nAccording to Norwegian senior staff officers, NATO exercises, such as Cold Response, \nare more focused on rehearsing high intensity warfare after “deterrence failed”, than \non mechanisms for de-escalation, mediation, and civil-military cooperation, which \ncharacterised most of the joint exercises between 2002 and 2010.62\n6. Conclusion\nBased on the Norwegian case, how should Northern Europe respond to the  Russian \nassertiveness? Is closer integration into Western security arrangements a viable \napproach, e.g. for smaller non-aligned states like Sweden and Finland? Three conclusions\ncan be deduced. \nFirst, as Northern Europe increasingly aligns with the US and other NATO \nforces, states like Sweden and Finland may more easily gain access to US decision \nmakers. From this vantage point, national concerns can be voiced more clearly in \ntough competition with numerous other European allies striving for US attention \n', 'Avoiding War\n279\nand reinforcements. Such access increases US awareness, and thus prospects for \nsuccessful activation of US security guaranties if needed. This logic is anchored in \nthe traditional tenets of alliance theory, where balancing is more commonly pursued \nby smaller states than bandwagoning.63 \nBut such a strategy may also increase the risk of more tension, instability and \nunpredictability. This is arguably so because Russia’s strategic forces will need an \nextended zone of security to protect their forces from US or other NATO allies’ \nprecision guided missiles. As an extended part of Northern Europe opens up for \nUS and NATO operations on their own territories, this reassuring effect could be \nnullified by Russian counter efforts aiming to protect its force. Balancing with the \nstronger part thereby creates a typical security dilemma because Russia, according to \nSnyder, will respond with more assertiveness.64 In particular, Sweden and Finland’s \nslide from “buffer” to “springboard” may increase the risk of geopolitical change in \nNorthern Europe. This is because both states’ territories play a more prominent role \nin US and Russian defence planning. \nIt can be argued that this is not likely to provide the population with more security \nbecause their national territories will be more exposed to unwanted Russian attention\nnecessary for military planning and readiness. A question for further research \ncould be to examine to what extent accelerated Nordic-Baltic defence cooperation \ncould alleviate a situation where smaller states more vigorously can address a military\nvacuum currently filled by US and Russian forces. \nSecond, the slide from “buffer” to “springboard” also means that domestic policy \nin Sweden and Finland will be more exposed to US expectations and demands. \nBased on the Norwegian experience, this is particularly so with regard to US expectations\nof reciprocity abroad. As in the case of Norway and Denmark, more troops \nfrom Northern Europe will be expected to participate in open-ended engagements \nin Central Asia, the Middle East and possibly Africa. This logic is consistent with \nanother alliance dilemma raised by Snyder, which is that clients may easily become \nentrapped into a patron’s war elsewhere because clients are afraid of being abandoned\nat home.65 \nDeployments abroad may on the one hand energise combat experience and critical\ncompetence among forces that will also operate at home. But they may also \nincrease the risk of fragmentation and critical shortcomings within a national force \nstructure that needs to be cohesively trained at home. Vulnerabilities deriving from \nthis over-stretch problématique may accelerate US dependency because simultaneous \nengagements abroad and at home are detrimental to small states’ military readiness\nand cohesiveness in the lower end of the conflict spectre. This trend, it may \nbe argued, may hamper efforts undertaken by small states, such as Sweden and \nFinland, to exert influence on how the strategic balance between deterrence and \nrestraint can be tailored vis-a-vis Russia. \nA question for further research however, would be falsify this assumption, and \nexplore alternative ways to cope with small states’ endemic over-stretch problématique. \n', 'Tormod Heier\n280\nCould it be that “pooling and sharing” among small states would provide more security\nthan outsourcing defence responsibilities to US forces even at the lower end of \nthe conflict spectrum? \nThird, increased US dependency may increase the risk of energising a “cult of the \noffensive” among smaller states in Northern Europe. While dependency may favour \nintegration and interoperability among like-minded states in the West, it may also \nlead to a deterioration in diplomatic relations with Russia. This is because national \nvulnerabilities make smaller states more inclined to escalate rather than de-escalate \ntense situations; seeking to avoid a fait accompli with Russia, a decisive outcome on \nshort notice will be required in order to trigger a US tripwire. \nSuch a strategy may – in a narrow sense – provide more security for Northern \nEurope because Russia will gain less security in relative terms. But in absolute terms, \nit will also, in accordance with the logic put forth by both Schelling and Holst, create\nless security for Northern Europe and Russia. This is because US forces will be \nincreasingly important at a much earlier stage in a potentially tense situation, which \nforces Russia to take precautionary efforts.66 It is important to note that Russia does \nnot fear the smaller states in Northern Europe. Russia only fears that the region \nwill become a ‘stepping stone’ for US operations towards Russia. A question for \nfurther research could therefore be to what extent self-imposed restraints put forth \nby smaller North European states are possible without displaying weakness and thus \ninvoking more Russian assertiveness. Could stronger mutual dependency between \nRussia and Northern Europe, e.g. on energy and trade, alleviate some of the military \ntension currently fuelling the regional security situation? \nNOTES\n 1.
