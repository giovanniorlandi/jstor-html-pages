Even though\nit might be a GENERAL STRIKE, I\ndo not think that I would have the\nnerve to face the brutalities of the av\nerage police simply for the sake of a\nhigher increase in wages, or a short\nening of the hours of toil; BUT, when\nit comes to a question of "free speech"\nI am ready and waiting. I am willing\nto got te jail OR TO HELL to main\ntain that privilege.\nAnd why should I be so anxious\nabout the matter of "free speech?"\nSimply because I consider free\nspeech to be the KEYNOTE OF ALL\nLIBERTY. ~>~. \' -\nWithout FREE SPEECH the revolu\ntionist would have a hard time indeed.\nWithout FREE SPEECH we would be\nset back a hundred years.\nFree speech is such a precious privil\nege that we should be willing to do\nanything under the sun to maintain it.\nWe should be ready and willing, it\nneed be, to take human life to main\n; tain the precious privilege of free\nspeech.\nFree assemblage and a free press\nare but different phases of free speech,\nand wherever either of them is as\nsaulted, it should be the first thought,\nAS IT IS THE FIRST DUTY, of every\ntrue revolutionist .to FLY to the RES\nCUE.\nLet nothing remain undone that is\nnecessary to secure free speech, free\nassemblage, and a FREE PRESS, even\nthought it may necessitate the most\nextreme measures.\nWith free speech the world is ours\nin a short time; for no living thing\ncan long withstand our argument. De\nnied this privilege we are slaves in\ndeed. All hail to the power of Free\nSpeech, Free Press and Free Assemb\nlage. For with these privileges at our\ncommand we can conquer the world.\nJOHN McSLARROW.\nTHE FUTURE BELONGS TO\nMAN.\nMr. Edison, the great genius and in\nventor, recently said:\n"Not individualism, but social labor\nwill dominate the future; you can\'t\nhave individual machines and every\nman working by himself. Industry\nwinl constantly become more social\nand Interdependent. There will be no\nmanual labor in the factories of the\nfuture. The men in them will be\nnteYely superintendents watching the\nmachinery to see that it works right.\ni lie workday, 1 believe, will be eight\nhours. Every man needs that much\nwork to keep him out of mischief and\nto keep him happy. But it will be\nwork With brain, something that men\nwill be interested in and done in whole\nsome, pleasant surroundings. Less\nand less man will he used as an en\ngine, or as a horse, and his brain will\nbe employed to benefit himself and\nhis fellows."

Edison sees "the handwriting j\noiv the wall" and knows that CO-j\noik3RATION must supplant COMPE- j\nlii [ON and that INDIVIDUALISM\nbelongs to a past age, when tools of\nthe hand were the only roachnles of\nproduction.\nThis country, with its Institutions,\nbelongs to the people who inhabit it.\nWhenever they shall grow weary of\nthe existing government, they can ex\nercise, their constitutional right of\namending it, or their revolutionary\nright to dismember or overthrow It.\n, . . Why Bhould there not be a\npatient confidence in the ultimate jus\ntice of the people? Is there any bet\nter or equal hope In the world? —\nAbraham Lincoln.\nWORKERS OF THF. WOILD UNITE! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT YOUR CHAINS YOU HAVE A WORLD TO WIN\nCl)e Commmttoealtf)\nCITY SCHOOL ELECTIONS.\nWorking Class Should Wake Up!\nNow that the capitalist! have made\nwar against our teachers, now that the\nclass war the WOrld over rages as\nnever before, now that free speech Mini\nfreedom of the press are threatened as\nthey have not been threatened for\nmore than a hundred years is It not\ntime that we of the working class\nshould come to see the significance of\nthe schools?\nTheir frantic efforts to keep the So\ncialists out of the schools should teach\nus the deep and abiding need for our\ngetting Into the schools. Let them\nraise the cry of politics. Every day In\ncapitalist schools they are teaching\nthe ethics of the master class. Is It\nany wonder that the schools are turn\ning out a race of scabs?\nLet us make it plain at the beginning\nof this campaign that we are not seiz\ning the schools to teach politics to the\nchildren. Did you ever realize how\nsilly it is to teach a little six-year-old\nthat he should vote the Socialist\nticket? Did you ever realize how out\nof place it is to think of having him\nmemorize the Socialist platform? Not\nas a matter of policy but as a matter\nof sound pedagogy we leave this kind\nof nonsense to our capitalist mentors.\nLet them burden the child mind with\npolitical platforms from away back.\nLet them teach the great virtue of\n"Hamilton\'s financial policy" and the\ngreat good that came from the "re\nsumption of specie payments." That\nbut reveals their unfitness to teach.\nThat but reveals the depths of their\nignorance of child nature.\nWork of the Socialist Teacher.\nWe of the social revolution have a\nwork to do in the school room that is\nnot political. It is scientific. It is to\nprepare the child mind for vital facts\nand for reasoning about vital facts. It\nis to banish from the schoolroom the\'\npolitical and metaphysical trash that\nhas there accumulated and stagnated, i\nIt is to bring into the schoolroom a\nclear conception of nature and of his\ntory, to bring back to child life the\nspirit of play and free development\nlong lost in the maze of examinations,\npromotions and midnight cramming.\nIt is not to teach subjection and sub\nmission, but to instill a love for free\nand fair discussion and the sprit of un\ntrammelled democracy in all things.\nWe want to drive from the schoolroom\nforever the hurry and worry of child\nlife that capitalist greed has planted\nthere. We of the working class are in\nno hurry. We believe in growth.\nIt is now up to the enemies of prog\nress to raise the cry of alarm. Let\nthem raise it. That is a healthy sign.\nThat but shows that we are hitting\nthe bullseye. That but shows us that\nwe should keep on our course for the\nconquest of the schools, not for politi\ncal purposes but to prevent their be\ning used for political purposes and for\neconomic purposes inimical to the\nworking class.\nRecation Versus Progress.\nEvery engine of the reaction will be\nused against us. Pope, potentate and\npickpocket will pelt us with anathe\nmas. But before us we see reaching\non into the future the coming race!\nThey are our children, and all that\nthey will ever suffer will be dut to\nignorance concerning the vital facts of\nlife, due to the inculcation of false\nideas. In the hands of our enemies\nthey will be taught the ideas that will\nperpetuate their slavery. The school\nbook is a more powerful weapon of\nthe reaction than the policeman\'s club.\n■ On the first Saturday in December\nin all cities of the first and second\nclass there will be an election for\nschool directors. Socialists will be\nneglectful In their duties if they fail\nto strain every effort to win places on\nthe boards in these cities.

Nil U DAY, OCTOBER 10 r>l :\nTHE TWENTIETH CENTURY INQUISI\nTION: SOCIALIST TEACHERS\' TRIAL\nPour hundred years ago men and\nwomen, youths and maidens were\nbrought before their tormentors and\nquestioned concerning their attitude\ntoward Cod. II was a SerioUS business\nio doubt bis existenoe or to be caught\nWorshipping any Cod but the lied of\nthe ruling Class. What was more, one\nbad to use the very formulas author\nised by the ruling class.\nComet now the twentieth century\nami with it a. new Inquisition. For the\nCo,! of their fathers the rulers have\nsubstituted a piece of cloth. This\npiece of cloth, which was once a sym\nbol of freedom, has come to be the\nsymbol of their power over the work\ners. Anything will do for a symbol.\nDossier, the tyrant of (he Alps, accord\nin;; io the old Swiss story, used his\nhat. Hoisting it upon a. pole be com\nmanded every recalcitrant Swiss to\nbow before this symbol and by this\nSalutation of an inanimate thing to\nnice the rule of the tyrant. "What\nis your attitude toward my hat?" said\nthe Inquisitor. "Will you salute it or\nwill you not?" Here in 191H they have\nchanged the wording of the question\ninto this: "What is your attitude to\nward the flag? Will you salute it or\nwill you not? We have drawn up a\nformula which we ask you to use in\nthis salutation. Did you question the\ncorrectness of this formula?"\nCrime of a Teacher.\nThus ran the inquisition in Olympia\non the 15th of October, 1913. The cul\nprit was J. E. Sinclair. He is a school\nteacher. He is also a Socialist. Fur\nthermore he writes for Socialist pa\npers. They brought whole bundles of\nthese Socialist papers into the inquisi\ntorial chambers with them and proved\nthis writing beyond dispute. They\nproved that he had questioned the\nformula of the salutation of the flag\nwhich they have made the symbol of\ntheir power. Also they proved that\nthis school teacher had stained the\nragged cloth of his trade by taking the\nside of the workers in a strike. They\neven proved that he questioned the\nright of the masters to use guns and\npick handles on underfed and over\nworked slaves who could endure their\nmisery no longer. They proved that\nhe had actually been seen on a plat\nform encouraging these dissatisfied\nworkers by word of mouth. He had\nalso been in parades of strikers. They\nalso proved that he had been a party\nto the renting of a theatre in which a\nman was going to speak for these\nstrikers.\nExposed Ruling Class Tyranny.\nAs though this was not enough to\ndam him forever, this recalcitrant ras\ncal attacked the actual power of the\nruling class as manifest in the person\nof an august judge. A copy of a So\ncialist paper was produced in court\ncontaining an article written by Sin\nclair, anyhow he admitted he wrote it.\nThis article told of a parade he had\nbeen in in the city of Seattle. There\nwere five or six hundred other persons\nalong with him in this parade, hut I bat\nmill., s il all the worse for Sinclair.\nThese paraders were making one\ngrand joke of Judge John 0. Humph\notherwise known as Humpty\n-1 dimply. They escorted men and\nwomen to jail in the dead of night to\nconvince the world that the said Judge\nwas not only a tyrant but also a foul.\nThis article ended with an appeal to\nthe people to gO Io Seattle and fill the\njail to make "contempt of court\ntemptible."\nSUBSCRIPTIONS DOUBLED\nDURING OCTOBER.\nAn Em - Report.\nThe number of subscriptions for the\nCommonwealth during the montl\nabove th\nBut the\namoui •\'\' \'lurl"\n\x84i Octi tne\ndouble the amount\nfor Hi\nBui\nscript\nomrade relax In hi\nshall not onl>\nrOB SO(UAM3T NEWS AND PROPAGANDA\nThi ; riotous attack on iiiw Judiciary\nof this fr -ounii j rai Made because\nJudge llumply Hunipl \\ had been pun\nishing certain persons for exercising\ntheir vocal orgfcn i bj addressing work\ning men and women where the judge\nin bis bench-made laws bail ordered\nthem not to.

They are a one horse affair\nand quite Strictly American. When\nyou \\ iolalo one of the injunei ion\nan- guilty of contempt oj court Now\nIhe courts are the very holy of holies\nof tin- ruling class and Ibis Socialist\nteacher actually asked twenty or thirty\nthousand persons to show contempt\nfor these courts and particularly for\non,- oi these courts, known officially\nas Department No. U of Ihe Superior\nCourt of King County, State of Wash\nington.\nAttorney Faussett in Characteristic\nRole.\nAt this stage let us Introduce the\ncharacters in the play. Every court\nhas its own clown and the new Inqui\nsition could not get itself properly\nstarted without one. Prosecuting At\ntorney Faussett filled this role in the\nplay with a naturalness that was\nalarming. He fumbled around with\nlaw documents and dropped them on\nthe floor. Hte fussed with his mus\ntache. He carried in armfuls of use\nless law books and then carried them\nout again like a little boy packing\naround firewood. Just before the\nmain performance this Faussett fel\n! low made a speech that was a weak\n[and watery dilution of the speeches\n(they used to make at inquisitions four\nhundred years ago before anyone dared\nto think of free speech, free press, or\nfresh air. He told of the things he\nwas going to prove. He would prove\nthat this man Sinclair did not have\nthe right attitude toward the flag. He\nwould prove that he wrote for Social\nist papers. He would prove that he\nshowed disrespect for authority, etc.\nMary Tudor, who had 218 heretics\nburned for not having the right atti\ntude toward her God three hundred\nand fifty years ago, was not able to\nbe present. But in her stead was Mrs.\nLizzie Jones, who had made the\ncharges against Sinclair. The artifi\ncial sweetness, the metallic voice, the.\n| sinuous Jesuitical way of getting\naround a point, and the general atmo\nsphere of a convent which this lady\nbring.-; with her peculiarly fits her for\nsalute, and the attack on Judge Humph\ntoral chambers.\nRebel Teacher Stands Pat on Class\nStruggle.\nJudge Cooley of Everett, gray, som\nber and sedate, went the ancient in\nquisitors one better in his examination\nof ihe culprit. He was not long in\nI wringing from the rascal Ihe admis\nsions that dearly showed that his at\ntitude toward the ruling class and all\nthe machinery of coercion used by that\nruling class was one of unconcealed\nantagonism.\nWorking men and women of Hie\ntwentieth century, what does all this\nmean? Let us stop this play and rea\nson together about its meaning. Here\nW e have l»en talking about freedom\na great deal for more than a century.\n\\\\ , have it burned into our very hearts\nwith lire crackers that we are free.\nTHE GAG OF THE BURGLAR\nAND THE GAG OF THE\nLAW.\n11,\\ jay Fox.)\nEvery attempt to gag the free ex\npression of thought is an unsocial act,\na crimo against society. That is why\nJudges and juries who try to enforce\nthese laws make themselves ridiculous.\nIt is very hard for a robber to convince\nhis victims that he is acting in their\nbehalf and for their good. Is there no\nparallel between the gag of the burglar\nand the gag of the law? Why does\nbasis, through its regular income, but\nwo shall be, able eventually to pay off\nback debts.\nWe have got the paper moving up\nward. Now let us keep it going, and\nthe way will be opened up to make\nthis rebel "sheet" a paper that we\nshall all b« proud of, because of Its\n"punch," and because of its sound\neconomic doctrine.\nAM together now I\n■ ; And here we have a man on trial for\n• exerol Inghii right to speak and write\nwhat he thinks be-,I for his fellow\n: men. l| ( . has written an article criti\ni proposed flag salute law which\n• even the legislature refused to pass.\nI lie has taken part in a. strike, lie has\n) : tOOd with the working class against\ni the capitalist class.

Hoover,\n\' who represented Sinclair, said that\nWhat Sinclair believed he believed and\na million men in the United States be\nlieved the same. What he had done\nthey would all do. Sinclair\'s efficiency\nas a teacher was beyond question. All\n\' they could accuse him of was for do\ning what he had a constitutional right\n\' to do. There was no jury pleading, no\n\' working on the sentiment, all was de\nfiance. The whole spirit of the de\nfense was: Do your worst. We want\n\'\'to know what rights the Socialist\n! teachers have. We ask nothing. We\nwill take everything.\nFair to All Classes (?)\n■ I\n. Hoover Astonishes Court by Candor.\n. | At the conclusion of the hearing\n, Mrs. Josephine Preston, the superin\ntendent of public instruction, took the\ni matter under advisement; but in so\n.announcing she made a short address\n: to the defendant that sounded more\nlike an apology for the adverse decis\n• ion that she had in mind than any\nthing else. She told of how fair she\nwas trying to be, how she had not read\nthe papers, nor talked to anyone about\n1 the case. She was very much con\ncerned as to whether the Socialists\n\' were taking the matter as persecution\nor not. She assured them that she\nwas considering nothing but the good\nI of the schools and that her long ex\nperience in public life enabled her to\nbe fair to all classes.\nI\nWe shall see what the outcome of\nthis inquisition may be. But its very\nexistence is a straw that shows the\ndangerous lengths that the master\nclass will dare to go in tlu ir attempt\n, to cut off free speech and the vaunted\nI freedom of the press. It also makes\nus feel the importance of seizing the\nschools for the business of freeing the\nrace.\nBuchanan\'s Trial.\nPreceding the Sinclair trial was the\ntrial of Fred h. Buchanan who was\ntried on fictitious charges to punish\nhim for taking the side of Sinclair in\nbis fight. The case against him was\nso foolish that it is surprising that\neven an Inquisitorial court would lis\nten to it. Yet for more than a day\nih. mill ground on. Then this case,\ntoo, was taken under advisement.\nNothing has been heard from either\nease yet. In the meantime both men\nare denied the right to teach school.\nMrs. Preston hinted that it might, take\nher a month to make up her mind as\nto the guilt of these two rebel teach\n\\nd the light of the sixteenth\ncentury still shines through the rag- ■\ngot fumes into the old jail that serves\nfor a capltol at Olympia. |\n— ,\nthe burglar use a gag?

Singularly\nenough this is a right that is enjoyed\nachers In most European coun\ntries, including even the land of the\nkaiser. But not so in the United\nStates. Teachers who are interested\nare about to submit to the leaders of\nthe various political parties resolu\ntions that they wish incorporated in\nthe politeal platforms. They want\nthe right to freely speak and act out\nside their universities, colleges or\nschools without incurring the risk of\ndismissal.\nOne would think this ought to go\nwithout, saying, that the teacher should\nbe as free as the doctor or the journal\nist, since in a general way freedom of\npress and of conscience are accepted\naxioms of our political life. Yet, you\nand I know that the way in which a\ncountry is theoretically governed is\nnot the actual way. As a matter of\nfact, nearly every school, college and\nuniversity in this country has been\nguilty of removing from its staff those\nmen whose private opinions or priv\nate conduct has been of a kind that\ndispleased the school, university or\ncollege authorities. The conduct of\nthe teachers and professors is re\nquired to be conventional and the\nopinions must be safe and sane. Offi\ncers of all ranks, teaching in various\ninstitutions all over the country, have\nbeen and are being made to suffer for\nentertaining views that are regarded\nas unorthodox.\nIt is curious that the fight for aca\ndemic freedom should still have to bej\nmade in this country. Germany has\nmuch less freedom of the press than\nwe have, but far greater academic free\ndom; we have greater freedom of the\npress, but the teacher has, apparently,\nfewer rights. The teacher here is en\ntirely at the mercy of a snob or an\nambitious politician. The teacher\'s\nindependence seems to be regarded as\na slight matter in the United States.!\nThe fact is that it is of the greatest\nimportance, far more important than\nfreedom of the press.

Now York.\ni! will be remembered that Dr. Wal\nlace announced the theory of evolution\nof species ■Iraultaneouslj with Darwin, ]\nand aided the latter iii much of hl« re*l\nsearch. Wallace Ih now pant ninety;\nyearn of iiki\'. but iii perfect possession\nor hti faculties. He wrlten In ■ itniu\nIhi-i.v clear and understandable way, i\nand the fad that ha uroatly modifies, i\nthe Idea of evolution aH Interpreted by i\nothers, and puds «iij> the declaration!\nthat an overthrow of the capitalist ays- i\nItem is absolutely essential to a further j\nadvance of humanity makes the work 1\nof supreme Interest and Importance. |i\nAmong conclusions of Dr. Wallace. i\nthat will startle believers In the theory; :\nof evolution of species are these: j«\nThat an Important change In the ex- i\nternal form of mankind Is impossible,\n(p. 111). That there Is no evidence of\nany Improvement in tin- Intellect of,\nman since the most remote records of\nhistory (pp. 8MB)- That morals are\nbaaed upon character, and are as pro\nnounced in the so-called savage as In\nth.. most civilized (pp. 10-18). That\nthe savage shows as much evidence of\ndegeneracy as of having evolved from I\nlower forms (pp. 40-44). That "I\n"we have as yet no knowledge of man\nin other than the human condition"\n(p. 108).\nThen comes an arraignment of mod\nern capitalism that is of especial Inter\neat to Socialists, Dr. Wallace saying:\n"Our whole system of society Is rotten\nfrom top to bottom, and the social en\nvironment, is the worst the world has\never seen." He discusses twentieth\ncentury environment, unsanitary dwell\nings, adulteration, bribery and gamb\nling, and declares that our "justice is\nimmoral." "One would think it self- 1\nevident," he says, "that justice ceases\'\nto be justice when it has to be paid\n, for." "Unjust and barbarous is the\n\' | system of money fines." He treats of\n> the increase In alcoholism, in suicide,\n\\ in prostitution and in armament as\n\' proofs of an increasing degeneracy\n\' that threatens not only civilization, but\n[ the race itself.\nWallace next comes to a discussion\nof natural selection, and raps the eu\n[ genicist for wishing to regulate natural\n; selection through statutes. He argues\n1 that the advance of the human race in\n! the future can come only through :\nmoral advance, wrought into actuality\n< .by abrogating immoral social and eco\n\', nomic conditions. He maintains that\nI when life is safeguarded in the Indus- j\n■ tries, there will follow naturally a les\n\'< sening of births, and with it a super\n; abundance of males, which will give\n1 \' every woman many opportunities t\nmarry, and that woman, when free in\n1 the selection of her mate, will, through\nI her long training in social morality,|\nI deny herself to the unfit, without any\n\' ; laws being necessary to favor real\n\' i natural selection. He concludes: "We\n!; must be amazed at the fact that there\n| is so much real goodness, real human\n\'> ity, among us as certainly exists, in\nN spite of the degrading influences that\n\' I have been compelled here to enum\n! crate. To myself there seems only\n; one explanation of the very remark- j\n■ able and almost incredible results just\n\', stated. It is that the Divine nature in\n; | vs — portion of our higher nature\n• which raises us above the brutes, and\n\'! the influx of which makes us men—\n! cannot be lost, cannot be deteriorated\n■ by conditions, however adverse, by\n• training however senseless and bad.\n! It remains in us, the central and es\n■ sential portion of our human nature,\n• i ready to respond to every favorable\n\'. opportunity that arises, to grasp and!\n; | hold firm every figment of high\nthought or noble action that has been !\n. brought to Its notice, to oppose even\n; to death every falsehood in teaching, \\\n• every tyranny in action."\n\', The significant thing about this book\n; is that it seems to show the way to\n• mutual understanding between the old\n\' theological viewpoint and the new evo\n; lutionary theory, by presenting com\n• : mon grounds and avoiding the ex\n■ tremes of both.\nSo long as society is founded on In\njustice, the function of the laws will be\nto defend and sustain injustice.

The work\ners WANT it.\nTho strife will never end until the\nproducing millions get the whole of\nsurplus value.\nBut what is surplus value?\nA man named Jones was an expert\non bees. * .\nHe saw that bees spent two-thirds\nof their time making honeycomb, and\none-third of their time making honey.\nHe set to work to manufacture the\ncomb. He was an inventor and he ac\ncomplished his purpose.\nThe bees then spent all of their time\nmaking honey.\nBut the comb was expensive, and so\nJones invented a process by which the\nhoney could be taken from the comb,\nand the comb used again and again.\nBut this was not enough, so he in\nvented a hive which enabled the bees\nto work all the winter.\nHe also discovered that if all the\ngood honey were taken from the bees\nin the fall, he could put into the hive\nsugar and water, and the bees would\nlive on that during the winter.\nJones was a great inventor, and he\ndid for the bees what most of the in\nventors have done for labor.\nTheir inventions have been used to\nfurther exploit labor, not to relieve\nlabor.\nJones was also a clever capitalist.\nHe discovered how to take the sur\nplus value and leave to the workers a\nbare subsistence.\n- Have you read Marx? If not, do so.\nAnd you will find the above an illus\ntration of the full meaning of two\nterms he uses — the one Wages, the\nother Surplus Value.\nTHE SURPLUS VALUE which the\ncapitalist takes IS THE HONEY.\nTHE WAGE which the workers get\nIS THE SUGAR AND WATER.\nCALUMNY.\nA whisper woke the air,\nA soft, light tone, and low,\nYet barbed with shame and woe.\nAh! might it only perish there,\nNor farther go!\nBut no! a quick eager ear\nCaught up the little meaning sound,\nAnother voice has breathed it clear;\nAnd so it wandered round\nFrom ear to lip, from lip to ear,\nUntil it reached a gentle heart\nThat throbbed from all the world\napart,\nAnd that—it broke!\n—Frances Sargent Osgood.\nIt can never be unpatriotic for a\nman to take his country\'s lids against\nhis government; it must always be un\npatriotic for a man to take his gov\nernment\'s side agains his country.—\nSteven T.

Sinclair, a highly educated and\nbrilliant scholar who has been teach\ning in the public schools in Washing\nton, has recently come into conflict\nwith the capitalist class of his dis\ntrict. Fortunately all members of the\nschool board are Socialists and it is\ntheir intention that the children in\nthat region be taught history from the\neconomic and not the Great Man\nstandpoint. Under the instruction of\nComrade Sinclair, the sordid economic\ninterests that were the mainsprings of\nfamous wars in history, were shown.\nThe great land-grabbers and robbers\nof the poor were exposed behind their\nthin masks of patriotism.\nThe pupils of Comrade Sinclair\nlearn real history and found economics\na fascinating theme. But his methods\naroused the wrath of the capitalist\nclass in Washington. There were I\nthose who ignored the school board\nand sought to recall Sinclair. At this\ntime he has been summoned before!\nthe state board of education of the\nstate or Washington to stand trial for\nhavinK dared to teach the truth.\nStarting with the November number\nof the Review, J. B. Sinclair will con\nduct a course ill Scientific Socialism,\ntaking up the three cardinal principles\nOf Socialism—the Class Struggle, the\nTheory of Surplus Value and the Ma\nterialist Conception of History.

Be\ncause these men hold Ihc iMUanoe\n(,f Injunctions, without jury trial,\nwithout recourse to the ordinary pro\ncesses of law. to i»\' assumption of\nlegal power never granted by the ton\n■tltutlon, without legal sanotloo or\nmoral right.\nJudge Humphries enjoined certain\npeople from speaKlng on certain\nstreets in the citj of Seattle, Secure\nmi the belief thai they were breaking\nno state statute nor city ordinance,\nthese people violated the injunction.\nThen began the wholesale jailing for\ncontempt of court and the ridiculous\nspectacle of a judge upon the bench\nacting the part of a buffoon or a\nking\'s jester, In the first Instance if\nthe street speakers were violating any\nlaw, the entire police force of Seattle,\nthe sheriffs deputies, or state troops,\nIf necessary, were at command to see\nthat the offenders were punished.\nNone of these forces were called\nupon, the ordinary process of law\nnever invoked. Why an injunction\nin the first place? The process of in\njunction was intended originally to\nbe used only to prevent destruction of\nor damage to property or protection\nof life and limb. Its use has been\nstretched to cover every imaginable\nhappening. This whole fight primar\nily is being waged to restore the in\njunction to its only proper use. Bear\ning that in mind, it is folly to think\nthat Judge Humphries\' discharge of\nthe prisoners settles anything. It set\ntles nothing.\nWe may have our own opinion\nabout the judgment, or lack of it,\nshown by the men and women who\nfilled the Seattle jail. Our opinion on\nthat matter is entirely beside the ques\ntion. They considered, most of them\nat least, that the surest way to focus\npublic opinion upon some of the\nweaknesses of our judicial system,\nwas by filling the jails. Let it go at\nthat, whether they were right or\nwrong in their choice of methods.\nThe fact has been emphasized that\nthe injunction is a court weapon that\nsadly needs modification. In the\nhands of a weak or corrupt judge (and\nwe do not believe Judge Humphries\nis "corrupt" in the sense that either\nmoney or any other form of remuner\nation can sway him, it is a power of\ndestruction that never should be\ngranted. Again, if anybody ever\nargues with you against the \'recall\nof judges," you can close the argu\nment and win the debate by uttering\njust two words —Judge Humphries.\nJudge Humphries ought to be off the\nbench, yet seems to be fastened as\nsecurely in his seat as if he was\nnailed to it. If out of this whole un\nsavory mess shall come, a unity of\nsentiment among the people in favor\nof judicial recall and against abuse of\nthe injunction writ, Judge Humphries\nwill after all have been an instrument\nof some good.

They left the question t<> state author\nity, story\'s "Constitution," a work published in 1878, and other\ncommentaries on the fundamental law. all lake this view, one anno\ntator says of this liberty of speech and of the press with which con\ngress refused to interfere, thai the language imports do more than\nthat "even man shall have a right to speak, writ", etc., so. always.\nthat he does not injure any person and disturb the government."\nThe right of the police to prevent open air meetings of any ut\nterances injuring the individual or the state is derived from general\nand specific grants of authority: and one has yet to hear of a case\nwhere a suppressed agitator secured from a federal court the rfghi\nt" get out on a street corner and defy the inhibitory order of the local\nguardians of the peace. New York\'s liberal attitude on the righi of\nspeech may in part grow out of local political necessities. Every voi\ning group in the metropolis likes to gather in ballots on as great a\nscale BS possible when election day comes. Vet innumerable instances\nhave l ii chronicled in recent years of the city\'s refusal to support\nfree B] bup to the danger point. In all parts of the country, in\ndeed, dangerous agitation is prevented, under state and local law, and\nwith the United States constitution affording the troublesome ones no\nhelp. Very often the suppreasive rules arc not put into effect until\n"liberty"" has been mi trial. But after this has been seen in action\nthe public usually yets around to an understanding of what the law\nreally is.\nMARK TWAIN ON FRENCH\nREVOLUTION.\nThe ever memorable and blessed\nrevolution, which swept a thousand\nyears of villainy away in one swift |\ntidal wave of blood —one; a settle\nment of that hoary debt in the pro\nportion of half a drop of blood for\neach hogshead of it that had been\npressed by slow tortures out of that\npeople in the dark stretch of ten cen\nturies of wrong and shame and mis\nery, the like of which was not to be\nmated but in hell. There are two\nreigns of terror if we would but re\nmember it and consider it; the one\nwrought murder in hot passion, the\nother in heartless cold blood; the\none lasted mere months, the other\nlasted a thousand years; the one in\nflicted death on 1,000 persons, the j\nother upon 100,000,000; but our\nshudders are all for the horrors of the\nminor terror, so to speak, whereas,\nwhat is the terror of swift death by\nthe axe, compared with lifelong death\nfrom hunger, cold, insult, cruelty and\nheartbreak? What is swift death by\nslow fire at the stake? A city ceme\ntery could contain the coffins filled\nby that brief terror, which we have\nall been so diligently taught to shiver\nat and mourn over, but all France\ncould hardly contain the coffins filled\nby that older and real terror which\nnone of us has been taught to see\nin its vastness or pity as it deserves."\n—Mark Twain, in "A Connecticut\nYankee at the Court of King Arthur."\nSMALL FARMER MUST GO\nALONG WITH THE EX\nHAUSTED SOIL.\nWhile small property In land ere\nates a class ofbarbarians- standing tiair\nway outside of society, a class rafter\ning all the tortures and all miseries of\ncivilized countries in addition to the\ncrudeneM of primltlTe forms of so\notety, lar^r |)ii>|M riy in land under\nminei labor-power i" the last region,\nin which ita prinuU energy weki\n-refuse, and in which it stores* up its\nj-Btrength as a reserve fund for the n\ngeneration of the vital power "i M\ntions, the land Itself.

The impudent rascal lias no right to criticise his mas\ntor\'s government, even though that same government may, through\nits capitalist-made laws and bourgeois constitution, rob him of all that\nshould give to life joy, comfort and freedom.\n"Whenever these people are molested they cry out in the name of\n\'free speech,\' and ask to he \'let alone.\' When they have been toler\nated for any length of time, they become bold enough to put into\nexecution their theory of destruction."\nDo you get that, gentle reader?\n"Theory of destruction."\nWhat does, for instance, the Socialist wish to destroy? Poverty I\nThat\'s it; and that only. Bui he cannot abolish poverty without abol\nishing the capitalist system which is its fruitful cause. Says the\nTimes:\n"Soapbox orators may declare a certain man, or a certain insti\ntution is objectionable to the Socialistic order to which the orator\nbelongs, and tell from 300 to 500 people just how such a person, or\nsuch an institution, may be destroyed by violence,—and no one listeii\ning will disapprove of what is being said.\nIs it any wonder, then, that at the present time, after such a con\ndition as lias been permitted to prevail for many months —this class\nshould feel that they have the absolute right to do what they please,\nin the manner they choose, without regard to the destruction which\nthey produce, —and to do all without being molested?"\n\' Of coarse, no "soapbox orator" ever said that "such a person"\nshould be "destroyed by violence." To abolish the capitalist class\nis doI to destroy the individuals composing that class; it is merely to\ndestroy their -raft and convert them into useful workers in the In\ndustrial Republic. But to this plan the "better element" would seri\nously object, in the name of patriotism and the flag. What the bosses\nwant i> full "law and order"; what the workers want is "anarchy"\nand "violence."\n"The cry of \'freedom of the press\' will be set up along with the\ncry of \' freedom of sp tt\' in order that the worst side of life may\nlie\'kept before tin- public ey. —and the strongest excuses advanced Tor\ndisorder and confusion.\nIf it lie iii the power of the constituted authority and the courts\nof the slate to prevent exaggerated publications as well as unlawful\nel assertions, they should combine in a great effori to do it.\nIt would be a splendid thing for a thousand business men of Se\nattle to organize a league of loyalty to law and order, thai they might\nshow to all the world that Seattle has the men who have the nerve to\nstand by what is right and decent-and frown upon lawbreaking in\nevery form."\nYes. indeedy.

Saving captured wild animals and\nsubjugated them for domestic service, why uol capture a few human\nanimals and domesticate them.l Why nol spare some <>ti l aptives\nof the battlefield \' No sooner thought of than done. Tl lass Btrug\ngle began here, and has continued to this day under one form or an\nother, sometimes openly, as under chattel slavery, sometimes slightly\ndisguised, as under serfdom, and now still further masked under the\nguise of the wage system. Under the specious principle of "freedom\no fcontract," the wage-earner is held in the meshes "I 1 bourgeoi\n"liberty." The two forms of slavery mentioned have this in •■ohi\nmon: under each of the two systems adopted, one class of men, the\nruling class, have always managed in one way or another to live upon\nthe labor of the working class, bj owning the means whereby the\nexploited class must live. In former times the workers were owned\nas one owns horses now; later- they were attached to the land; in\nmodern times, under capitalism, they are enslaved to both tl wners\nof the land and to the tools of production and of distribution.\nSo there have been three forms of slavery, under which the class\nstruggle has ever been waged: namely, chattel slavery, serfdom ami\nwage slavery, the latter being in some respects more cruel and de\nvastating than either of the two precqding.\nNaturally, the owning or ruling class have always made laws and\nfounded social institutions calculated to strengthen their mastery over\nthe oppressed class. The prevailing conceptions of "good" and "bad"\nhave, on the whole, always followed in the wake of "profit" and\n■■loss."" A Bavage, in a state of nature, would scorn to live wholly\non the labor of weak women and little children; hut our Christian\ncapitalist moralists find ready excuses for those who prow rich on\nthe labor of mothers and infants. Religions, codes of morals, legal\nsystems, all take their form from the prevailing economic system. Not\nexactly "might," hut "profit" is "right." A "good man," under\nbourgeois ethics, is one whose moral and economic views coincide, not\nwith the preservation of life and human happiness, hut. with the\npreservation of property in the hands of the ruling class. and the con\ntinued exploitation of the workers by the shirkers.\nOur industrial masters, and their retainers, attempt to justify\ntheir brutality, selfish course on the -round that confiscation of the\nwealth produced by the laboring class is their proper reward for "ex\nceptional ability" in separating the workers from the fruits of their\nskill and industry. Our masters argue this way: Suppose each\nworker docs produce eighteen times more wealth now per day (thank-;\nto the gradual improvement of machinery by penniless inventors).\nthan he could have done forty years ago, does he not have at least\ntwo times more comforts now than had his grandfather who was .just\nas poor as lie.\' Why should not the capitalist-politician appropriate\ntin- remaining sixteen parts of the added wealth produ I\' What\nincentive would he left the workers for further exertion if the be\nuevoleni capitalist refused to expropriate from the workers the\nproduct of the land and machinery, and the "profit" derived from\nowning the means of distribution! To be sure it\'s a little hard on\nthe workers to produce so much and enjoy so little; hut think of the\ndemoralizing effects of happiness and economic security! No, it is\nthe decree of Nature that to the shrewdest and strongest the prizes of\nthe earth belong. It is a case of "survival of the fittest." If certain\nmen have proved "brainy" and energetic enough to gain possession\nof the land, machinery, and even the government of the United States,\nthey have hut reaped the reward of their energy and enterprise. This\nis the ethic of capitalism as applied to the strenuous "captain of in\ndustry." I\'.llt do these little izoldell rules apply with ccpial force to\nthe working class.\' Let US see.\nCertain members of the working class, having educated them\nselves in history and economic science and the philosophy of Social\nism, have discovered thai whai keeps them propertylesa and poor is\ntheir foolish suppori of an industrial system and political regime which\nis no longer adequate to serve the needs of the common people—the.\nwage-earning proletariat; having discovered thai capitalism has al\nready served its purposes, and thai the collapse of the prevailing sys\ntem is inevitable, certain of the more intelligent workers propose to\nunite with the political party whose ultimate aim is the overthrow of\nplutocracj and wage-slavery, with a view to the establishmeni of an\nIndustrial Republic, wherein the ownership of the land and the in\nstruments of production and distribution sluill be vested in the people;\n\x84 g t \\ i , under which each worker would gel whai he earned, and\nunder which \'>■\'. able-bodied citizen would have to earn what he\nwould <t \'It; re would be i re "dividing up" with tl w ners\n.it\' 111 1..in1 .-•\'! machinei sii tl owners thereof and the users\ntherooi wo l«l be one and the same, Production would be carried on\nfoi IHE iot t » PROFIT nor for the enrichment of a few a 1 I\n11 \\i» iisi- «>t the n anj\n( * >». ntl y witl what we know of the ori^iTi and purposes of\ni-iili ri ilans ethics and law, this intelligently\'directed effort of tin\nproletariat (the "mob," us they arc called by Mr. Roosevelt) to better\ntheir condition is branded as anarchy, as an assault upon the American\nFlag! Those qualities and capabilities which*, in a member of the\nii class would be vaunted as intelligence, self-reliance, or dis\ncernment, in the worker — the waire-slave —go to make up "nn unde\nmr\'able citizen." What an insult to the trading-class, that a common\nwage-Hlave should presume to take n guiding hand in politic*, should\ndare to attempt the organization of a party devoted to the aggrandize-^\nincut of the common people, and tlie wresting from their throats the\ndcatli-trrip of a judicial oligarchy!

The large dallies are owned\nnnd controlled by the same class that\nown the mlneß, mills, smelters and\nother great Industries of this country.\nThe greatest news ausociations are\ncontrolled also by the same class. You\ndon\'t expect dividends from the, mines,\nthe big railroad corporations owned by\nthis class why do you expect any\nideas that will benefit you through\nm .-. ipapera owned by the Mine i\nand often by the tame parties?\nThe organization for controlling the\npress of the country Is perhaps the\nmost perfect of all the organizations\nfor controlling the wealth and direct-\nIng the" energies of the country. But\nthe capitalist press, like the whole j\nsystem of capitalism, directly depends\nupon the support of the working class.\nThe whole intelligence trust* of which\nthe newspaper Is the chief item, would\nvanish like a snowball in a fiery fur\nnace if the workers would but read\nand support the papers published in\ntheir own interest— their own class\nand should own them collectively\nwhere possible. It requires a battle\nto win a voice in the control of an In\ndustry—to be able to formulate a\nschedule of wages and hours. But the\nwage workers could control the press\nof the nation and the world by the\nsimple process of being true to them\nselves and their fellows by supporting\nthat part of the press which condemns\nthe wrongs they suffer and points how\nthey can end them.\nIn the large dailies how much do we (\nread of the sufferings of the poor—\nhow much of the great industrial con\nflicts are pictured in their true col\nors—how many details were given of\nthe great West Virginia tragedy?\nThere is a great battle on in Michigan\nbetween the great copper interests\nand the miners. It is the greatest\nbattle in the history of the Western\nFederation of Miners. Twenty thou\nsand men out of work, striking for the\nright to unite with their own class in\nan effort to wring from their masters\na sufficient amount in wages to pre\nvent starvation for themselves and\ntheir families. The officials of the\nstate, true to their class, turned the\nmilitia over to the mine owners. The\nmine owners have also imported gun j\nmen to shoot down the workers.\nWomen are insulted daily, homes are\nraided, the men and their families are\nsuffering every outrage usually heaped\nupon the working class in such indus\ntrial wars. How much have you read\nof this struggle in the large corpora\ntion-owned dailies? Very little! And\nthat decidedly colored in sympathy\nwith the gigantic corporations. We\nsee instead of our conflicts: "Harry\nThaw Kidnaped"; some priest mur\ndered some one; suicides, divorce\ncases, a brilliant picture of some mil\nlionaire\'s party, varied by the death of\ngome "leading manufacturer" now and\nthen.
