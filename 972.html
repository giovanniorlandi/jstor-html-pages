During an exciting\nscene in, the house of commons today,\nPremier Balfour moved the suspension\nof John O\'Donnell and the latter cross\ned the floor, stood in front of Balfour,\nshouted a defiance and shook his fist in\nthe premier\'s face. O\'Donnell was sus\npended by a vote of 341 to 61.\nIS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS1\nWiikesbarre, Oct. 16 The informa\ntion from Washington early this morn\ning that both parties to the controversy\nin the anthracite coal strike had readi\ned an agreement to arbitrate and that\nthe great conflict is about to close was\nreceived throughout the entire hard\ncoa\'l region with greatest satisfaction.\nWhen the Information was received\nfrom the national capital about\no\'clock this morning that an agreement\nhad been reached by the representa\ntives of both parties to the struggle,\nthere was only a score of newspaper\ncorrespondents and a few stragglers at\nstrike headquarters. District Presidents\nDuffy and Fahy were in the hotel but\ncould not be seen. President Mitchell\narrived from Washington nearly half\nan hour alter the information was re\nceived and he had little to say on the\noutcome. After a short conference with\nSecretary nnd Treasurer Wilson, who\nir.et him at the railroad station, Mr.\nMitchell retired and was in his office\ni-.ain by. h:30 a. m. To a delegation of\nreporters who called upon him, he said\nhe would have nothing to! say until af\nter tho meeting of the district boards,\nlia would not make a prediction as to\nwhat tho, three district boards would\ndo.\nAt 9:55 a. m. Presidont.Mitchell issued\nthe following statement:\n"Wiikesbarre, Pa., Oct. 16. Ap\npreciating the anxiety and impatience\nof the public and the mine workers for\nsome authoritative statement from this\noffice, I issue this bulletin to say that I\nwas unalterably opposed to the accep\ntance of or acquiescence in the form of\nsettlement proposed by the coal opera\ntors because It restricted the president\nof the United States in making his se\nlection of the men who were to deter\nmine the question involved in the coal\nstrike. These restrictions having been\nremoved and a representation given to\norganized labor as as to organized\ncapital, I am how prepared to give my\npersonal approval to a settlement of the\nIssues involved in this strike by the\ncommission selected by the president\nand shall recommend to the executive\nofficers of districts 1, 7 anil 9 in their\nmeeting today, that an immediate call\nbe issued for a convention whose au\nthorization is necessary to declare the\nstrike at an end. In the meantime I\ntrust the people of our country will be\nas patient as possible, as we are mov\ning as rapidly as the interests of our\npeople will permit. Signed John Mitch\nell, President United Mine Workers of\nAmerica."\nMr. Mitchell\'s public statement clear\ned the situation considerably. It is now\nfor the miners to act and not one per\nson can be found around headquarters\nwho is not of the opinion that the dis\ntrict boards will call the convention and\nthat the convention will decide to send\nthe men back to work immediately. It\nis reasonably certain that the delegates\nwill meet in this city. The members of\nthe three district boards began gather\ning at headquarters soon after 8 o\'clock\nand nearly all of them were on the\nground by 10 o\'clock. The principal\nsubject of discussion was" the. make-up\nof the commission. Few members had\nany opinion to express for the reason\nthey did not know much about the at\ntitude of the members. Some of them\nbelieved the board favorable to the\nminers.\nThe three district boards went into a\nsefcret session at 2 o\'clock In the parlor\nof the Hart hotel. According to an\nofficer high in \'the council\'s union, it 1b\nprobable the convention will be called\nfor Monday, although there is still a\npossibility that Saturday may be the\nday. The convention probably will be\nheld in this city. The length of the\nconvention will depend upon the\namount of debate. At this time it looks\nas though a general resumption of work\nwill not be effected until next Wednes\nday or Thursday.\nBAER VERY BUST.\nPhiladelphia, Pa;, Oct. 16. President\nBaer of the Reading Company, reached\nhis office at 8:30 o\'clock this morning,\nHe said he had not heard the results of\nthe Washington conference yesterday;\n. that he had not read the morning news\npapers and was too busy to read them.\nFor this reason, he said, he could not\ndiscuss the situation.\n.Few of the representatives of the coal\ninterests would discuss the status of\nthe coal situation, beyond expressing a\nbelief that the commission named last\nnight has a tremendous task before It.\n"It has a serious prqblem to solve,"\nsaid President Oliphant of the Dela\nware and Hudson road. "The question\nof the wages the men are to receive,\nhow the men are to be paid in different\nmines and in different veins in the same\nmines are some of the questions. These\nare the problems that men have grown\ngray headed trying to solve." .\nThe miners convention will be held at\nWiikesbarre at 10 o\'clock Monday.

Notwithstand\ning the severe strain incident to the\nmental and physicr.; .; j "atw-\nday and last night, President Roosevelt\nwas at his desk early today. Surgeon\nGeneral O\'Reilly and Dr. Lung called at\nthe temporary White House shortly af\nter 9 o\'clock and announced on leaving\nthat he va3 progressing finely and was\nin excellent spirits. It is understood\nthat the miners\' president suggested to\nPresident Roosevelt that In the selec\ntion of the members of the commission\nhe Include a representative of the clergy\nand one who is known to be in practi\ncal, if not in active sympathy with or\nganized labor. His desire In this respect\nwere gratinea Dy tne president s ap\npointment of Bishop John L. Spalding\nand E. K. Clark, grand chief of the Or\nder of Railway Conductors. It is un\nderstood that those named as member\nof the commission have Indicated to the\npresident their willingness to accept\nthe trust Imposed upon them. The re\nport of the commission will be made to\nthe president and by him will be com\nmunicated to the parties to the contro\nversy and to the general public.\nuenerat John M. Wilson, U. S.

But\nthen these capitalists always know how\nto make up for their losses and in the\nend the people pay the bills.\nThe Democrats had gleefully hoped\nthat the general sympathy with the\nstriking coal miners would reduce the\nRepublican vote next, month. But the\ncontrary result is now feared by them\nsince it has become known that the\ngreat majority of the coal barons are\nDemocrats, among them being the ring\nleaders, J. Pierpont Morgan and Louis\nBaer.\nIt is no", only necessary for New Mex\nico to re-elect Delegate Rodey, but to\nelect him by a larger majority than\nwas ever before given any candidate for\ndelegate. The aggregate vote cast at\nthe election v\'n xi month should also\nbe an indication that the population of\nNew Mexico has increased materially In\nlate years. To that end tin; party\nworkers should see to it that every man\nentitled to a vote is registered.\nIn Germany there are eighty-nine\nmanufacturers who make briquets out\nof coal dust and soft -coal, which are a\ngood substitute for anthracite coal\nThey manufacture 100,000 tons of that\nfuel annually, which . burns without\nsmoke and \'leaves only reddish brown\nashes. At Gallup, in this territory\nsuch a briquet plant has been built and\nt is understood that these briquets can\nbe manufactured and laid down any\nwhere in the United States for J" a ton.\nAs one ton of briquets has the fuel val\nue of two tons of bituminous coal\nthere should be a good market for them\nand they should solve the problem pre\nsented by the coal stringency in the\neast.\nThere are hundreds and hundreds of\ncitizens In New Mexico who have failed\nto take advantage of the provisions of\nwhat is called the "small holdings act."\nDelegate Rodey has a bill pending in\ncongress extending the provisions of\nthis act for the benefit of the small \'land\nowners. Another reason, therefore,\nwhy he should be re-elected. The pres\ntige and strength, re-election will give\nhim, will make It much easier to have\nthis bill enacted into law and make its\nprovisions more liberal to many of the\nsmall land owners and ranchmen along\nthe Rio Grande and in other sections of\nthe territory, who, through ignorance\ninability, have failed to procure ti\ntles to the parcels of land which they or\ntheir ancestors have had possession of\nfor many years.\nSOLVING THE SERVANT PROBLEM. .\nA newspaper published at Grand\nRapids, Mich., the home of the furni\nture factories, predicts that by the\nyear 2,000 there will be no servant prob\nlem and its prediction will make many\nhousewives feel as If they had been\nborn a hundred years too early. The\nprediction Is that the homes of the fu\nture will be warmed by some heat gen\nerating system. Air wi\'l enter through\npre per tubes In the wal\'s which will\nwarm the house and capture the dust.\nWalls will not meet the floors at right\nangles, but in graceful curves and thus\nsweeping and cleaning will be lighten\ned. \'Windows will be clea.ied by touch\ning a button and turning on wa\'ter that\ncontains a solvent.

As a citizen a model of integrity\nand domestic virtue, as a states-man the\nauthor of the practical system \'which\nhas made his name a synonym for\nprosperity." As a president, wise and\nstrong, bringing together hostile.inter\nf.-sts and conflicting sections, until at\nliiii tragic death there was but one la\nment, and a common sorrow- for the\ngreat, wise, and good man who had\ngone. Li t us rise, and stand with bow\ned heads, and sorrowing hearts in\nmemory cf our great leader.\nBe it resolved,\nThat we again endorse the National\nRepublican platform at Philadelphia\nupon which President McKinley and\nPrf-Fldent Roosevelt, were elected, and\nunder which prosperity has continued\nIn our land, our prestige has been in\ncreased abroad, and a new republic has\nbeen added to the nations of the world\nBy the wise and patriotic administra\ntion of President McKinley and its con\ntinuance by his successor, American in\ndustries have prospered as never before\nand our commerce has expanded until\nthe world is our market.\nThat we recognize in President\nRoosevelt a fit successor to President\nMcKinley, faithfully carrying out his\npolicies, and when new emergencies\narise, meeting them with the strong\ncourage of conviction. And we believe\nPresident Roosevelt has shown that he\ndeserves the position which he now\nholds by the suffrages of the people,\nInstead of by statute, and we heartily\nfavor his nomination for president in\n190-1, when we hope to cast for him our\nfirst electoral vote.\nWe most heartily endorse the admin\nistration of Governor Otero in the ter\nritory, which hasi resulted in improv\ning our financial standing and moral\ncredit at home and abroad. It has in\nduced new capital to come into the ter\nritory, and protected what was already\nhere. And especially we endorse his\npersonal and official efforts to improve\nthe method of assessments and taxa\ntion which have resulted in adding one\nand one-half million to our tax rolls\nfor the present year. His official and\npersonal conduct has been subject to\nthe most searching scrutiny by . two\npresidents and two senates with the re\nsult that it has been approved by t\'hem,\nand on that result we sincerely con-\ngratulate him.\nTVc endorse our delegate to congress,\nHon. B. S.

We denounce as un\nworthy of the name those Americans\nwho have assailed that army and\nsought to bring discredit upon the gal\nlant officers and men who are upholding\nour flag In that far-away country.\nWe affirm that the Republican party\nIs the first and only one to take any\npractical steps towards the suppression\nor control of so-called trusts or unlaw\nful combinations of capital. The "Sher\nman law" passed by congress in 1890\nhas not proved adequate to the end, but\nthe Republican party through Its pres\nident and law officers is endeavoring by\nevery legal means to control such com\nbinations where they exist and a spec\nial bill is now beilng framed to be pre\nsented at coming congress for that pur\npose, and we denounce as willful false\nhoods all charges made by the Demo\ncrats, that the Republican party is in\nfavor of or in any manner friendly to\nsuch combinations of capital.\nResolved that we regard the coal oil\nInspection law as detrimontcU o the\nbest interests of the people of .he ter\nritory and we recommend its, ropeal at\nthe earliest possible moment..\nCall for a Republican\nCounty Convention\nA delegate convention of the Repub\nlican voters of the County of Santa Fe\nIs called to meet at the Court House In\nthe City of Santa Fe at ten o\'clock on\nMonday, the 27th day of October, A.

It connects tin- Ferrls-Haggerly\nmine and the Battle Lake district with i\nthe smelter at Grand Encampment. The\ntremway is the idea of Willis G. Emer\nson and saves hauling the ore over the\nmountain roads. It is built in four sec\ntions, each four miles long. There are\n270 towers, and 16 tension stations, four\nof which are double. The cable used\nmakes 293,275 feet and it weighs 439,696\npounds. In the construction, 1,250,000\nfeet of lumber was used and an aver\nage of 200 men employed for six months\nThe total cost was $300,000.\nEach of the chief\norgans of the body is a\nlink in the chain of life.\nA chain is no stronger\nthan its weakest link,\nthe body no stronger\nthan its weakest organ.\nIf there is weakness of\nheart or lungs, liver or\nkidneys, there is a weak\nlink in the chain of life\nwhich may snap at any\ntime. Often this so\ncalled "weakness" is\ncaused by lack of nutri\ntion, the result of disease\nof the stomach and other\norgans of digestion and\nnutrition. Diseases o f\nthe stomach and its allied\norgans are cured by the\nuse of Dr. Pierce\'s Golden\nMedical Discovery.\nWhen the diseased stom\nach is cured, diseases of\nother organs which seem\nremote from the stomach\nbut which have their\norigin in a diseased condition of\nstomach and other organs of digestion\nand nutrition, are cured also.\n"I was in poor health when I commenced\ntaking Doctor Pierce\'s medicines," writes Mr\nElmer Lawler, of Volga, Jefferson Co., lud. "I\nhad stomach, kidney, heart, and lung troubles.\nWas not able to do any work. I had a seveie\ncough and hemorrhage of the lungs, but after\nusing your medicine a while I commenced to\ngain m strength and flesh, and stopped cough\nlag right away.
