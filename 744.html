        <pre>['VOL. XXIX.\nBOONE WATAUGA COUNTY, N. C, THURSDAY MAY 30, 1918.\nNO. 35.\nGovernor is First Man to Eliminate too\nUse of Wheat Floor.\nIn response to Food Adminis\ntrator Henry A. Tuge\'s appeal\nto North Carolina patriots who\nare in position to do so to go\nupon a wheatless diet until the\nnew harvest and i li\nadditional quautity of flour for\nexport to the armips nf tlm ITnir.\ned States and its allies, Gov. and\nftirs. bickett have promptly sent\nin their names for enrollment on\n"Marse Henry\'s honor roll." The\ngovernor and Mrs. Bickett have\nbeen in the very forefront of all\nwar activities since the war be\ngan. (Jov. Bickett has issued\nhis famous "war earden" Droc\nlamation last spring even before\nwar was declared.\nThe second name entered on\nthe honor roll is that of Mrs. K.\nB. Patterson of Hickory, who\nwrites that for the past ihree\nweeks she has used no wheat\nflour and was eladlv riledcrinfir\nv w -it- c?\nherself to use none until the next\nharvest . The third nam is that\nof It. F. Beasley, commissioner\nof public welfare in North Caro\nlina, who in the course of his let\nter writes:\n"Permit me to say that I dp\nnot consider this any sacrifice at\nall, certainly not one to be men\ntioned in these days of real sac\nrifices. The food experts list\nwheat, corn, oats, rice and\nrye are practical equivalents\nin food value. In our section\nthe vegetable season is comiog in\nto full swing. Potatoes especially\npromise to be plentiful and cheap.\ntoo much on wheat in the South.\nand you will not only be doing\ngood work for our soldiers and\nI UUHU llllil DUUUIT " - I VUU av I\nIs Watauta for Wheat Coiservation?\nThe Food Administration isis\n8uio(ran appeal for the conser\nvutiou of wheat. Using the words\nof Mr. Herbert C. Hoover In an\naddress to the Hotel Men of the\nInited States, he says: "Our\nwheat situation today is the\nmost serious situation in the food\nsupply of the whole allied world.\n1 am jroing to make an appeal.\nThe service that we ask of you\nthat we ask of every well-to-do,\nevery independent person in the\nTinted Stutea today is that he\nor she shall abstaiu from the use\nof wheat in nny form, until next\nharvest."\nAh Home one has remarked, sub\nHT.bing to the Liberty Loan and\ncontributing to the Red Cron\nWar Fund, and then indulging\nour iipM\'tites for wheat, indiffer\nent to the needs of our soldiers\nmid allies, is giving with one\nlmml mid holding back with the\nother.\nThe merchants of Valle Cruris\nhave placed their patriotic duty\nabove their business interests,\nMr. W. W. Mast and Mr. R.- A.\nFarthing, manager of the V. C.\nCompany, in response to thisap\npeal, have both declared their in\ntention nt buying uo more wheat\nflour until the next crop is har\nvested, when, the Food Adminis\ntration hopes, the wheat prob\nlem will be over.\nSo much for ValleCrucis. Will\nnvt the other merchants of ti e\ncounty stand shoulder to shoul\nder with these in th opportun\nity to render good and. efficient\nservice? And will not each cus\ntomer da bis part by cheerful ac\nquiescence, and those who have\ntheir, ou supply tend ready to\nHen. T. B.
