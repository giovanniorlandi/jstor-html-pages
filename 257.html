This paper presents development of a model to be used to select the best option for building \nreplacement in public ownership such as public library, stadium, hospital and school buildings. Buildings life \ncycle management should be transparent and cost efficient. Hence, decisions taken during the life cycle of the \nbuildings should be based on clear justification. One of the major issues in facility planning is to determine \nwhether to rebuild or restore the existing facility. In fact, for government assets, they have to be economically \nmanaged by knowing the holding cost, so that it is viable to be retained in long run. The objectives of this paper \nwere to establish relationship between replacement cost and cost decision making factors through the \ndevelopment of replacement cost model towards an economic efficiency for government buildings. Three stages \nof process were involved in this study. They are, stage 1, which explain on the significance factors of Cost \nDecision Making (CDM) and Replacement Cost (RC). It followed by exploration of the relationship between \nCDM and RC in Stage 2. Finally, the development of replacement cost model that expected to increase \neconomic efficiency and transparency of building replacement. The results expected to provide a raw evidences \nto support a concept that refurbishment of existing building would be more benefit than replacement to the new \nones. It is also expected that the results could be used by organizations especially for the decision makers as a \nguideline or tool to make a wise decision in building replacement related activities.  \n1. Introduction \nIt is well understood that the subject of building \nreplacement is relatively new and considered juvenile \nin Malaysia. There are a few researchers that have \nbeen carried out focusing on the scope and the \nelement of building replacement. By the way, very \nless attention has been given on building replacement \ndecision making and it is very rare to see research \ncarried out on the subject of replacement cost of \nbuilding. As for the federal government, there is no \nstandard format or guide line to be called standard \noperating procedure to be followed as a guide or a \nblueprint to the entire public client in terms of \nbuilding refurbishment. The determination of the cost \nfor refurbishment work in government-own buildings \nis the federal government or the state government \nbuilding has always been a headache and conflict \nbetween the contractor and client. Worsening the \nscenario, it is always a problem and it is usually a \nvery hard task to determine the exact cost of \nrefurbishment works such as repairs, replacement or \ninternal maintenance works and estimated cost \nusually go haywire and far from the actual cost. \nUnfortunately, there is no uniformity in the \nprocurement procedure or standard contract \nregulation being used. In the public sector, it is \nknown that among the biggest obstacle is the \n'resistance to change'. (N.Mohd Noor, 2011). \nThis study will also review and identify the public \nsector practice in the aspect of building replacement \nmanagement and their relation in cost decision \ndetermination. It is hope to lead to a better \nunderstanding of the issues related to the costs \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n Â© The Authors,  published  by EDP Sciences.

The aim of this paper is to \npromote innovative model that will become a \nframework or guideline as to improve and as an \nadded value to the existing procedure. This model \nwill also consider some adaptation from the existing \nmodel that has been implemented by other countries. \nThese have been proven to be effective and \nsuccessful in its implementation. However it should \ntaking into account our local culture and \nenvironment. It is hope that this cost decision model \nwill benefit the largest owner that is public \nauthorities such as The Ministry of Work and Public \nWork Department as the biggest agency that manage \nthe government buildings.  \nTable 1:    The Distribution of Pre War Urban Building in Malaysia \nNo States No of Historical Buildings No States No of Historical \nBuildings\n1 Penang 5057 8 Sarawak 1010\n2 Perak 3351 9 Negeri Sembilan 999\n3 Johor 2323 10 Pahang 831\n4 Malacca 2177 11 Terengganu 420\n5 Kuala Lumpur 1763 12 Kelantan 373\n6 Kedah 1282 13 Perlis 25\n7 Selangor 1166 14 Sabah 10\nTotal 20,787\nFor introduction, refer to Table 1 as example, \nthere are still many historical building and old \nbuilding in Malaysia. Since the building boom of the \n1970s, many of Malaysia's historic buildings have \nbeen demolished. Recent large scale urban \ndevelopment continues to threaten pre-war buildings, \nwhile other historic buildings are simply deteriorating \ndue to age, neglect and high cost of maintenance.  \nFee (1998) expressed that to lose these buildings, \nhowever is effectively to obliterate historical \nmemories, and there is now increasing pressure from \nvarious segments of the community to conserve the \nnation's historical heritage. As we all known that \nconservation is the action taken to prevent decay, \nembracing all acts that prolong the life of cultural and \nnatural heritage. Building conservation according to \n(Fielden,2000; Insall,1972) relates specifically to the \nprocess of repair, maintenance and restoration of \nhistoric buildings which aim to prolong a building's \nlife and function.  \nWhile most of the buildings surveyed were new \ndevelopments, several were refurbishments of \nexisting buildings. With the growing recognition of \nthe important role that refurbishment may play in \nimproving the performance of the existing building \nstock, it was seen as important, given the constraints \ninherent in refurbishing an existing building, to \ncompare their performance with the new ones. The \nkey conclusion is that extensive refurbishments, and \neven fit outs within the constraints of an existing \nshell, are quite capable of equalling and even \nsurpassing the performance of completely new \ndesigns from the point of view of the building users\n(George Baird, 2014). Building life cycle \nmanagement should be transparent and cost efficient. \nHence, decision making taken during the life cycle of \nthe building should be based on clear justification.  \n2. Literature Review \n2.1 Decision Making \nMany managerial researches in the past several \ndecades, especially in the early 80's, have \ninvestigated and written about managerial decision \nmaking from a variety of dimensions and \nperpsectives (e.g. Argyris,1976; Cohen et al., 1972; \nHickson et al.,1986; Mintzberg et al.,1976; \nSimon,1957; Werhrich & Koontz,1993; \nKim&Mauborgne,1998). In spite of this ongoing \nattention, the subject of decision making is still in \ncontradictory and controversial phase with theoretical \ndilemmas. Harrison (1999) believed that part of the \nproblem is derived from the multidisciplinary nature \nof the decision making (e.g psychology, economics, \n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n2\n", " \n \npolitics, sociology and mathematics which all \ncontribute their own perspectives). The problem can \nbe more complicated by differentiating decision \nmaker into individual, group, multi-group or \norganizational (Kriger & Barnes, 1992). The \npreceding discussion illustrates three important \nthemes in managing an organization:  (1) the link that \nexists between the success of an organization and the \nquality of its managerial functions, (2) the link that \nexists between success of the managerial functions \nand managerial decision-making outcomes, and (3) \nthe third theme is related to the first two, attempt to \nlink managerial decisions outcomes to knowledge \nand ability of managers in making a decision.  This \ntheory represent as Figure 1 below: \nFigure 1: Decision Making Factors \n2.2 Sustainable Asset Management \nSustainable asset management crystallized the \nconcept of 'cradle to the grave' into existence. It \nbasically puts forth the consideration for maintenance \nright from the design stage all the way to the \noperation of the building, as well as making it ready \nfor adaptive re-use.  Based on Figure 2, achieving \nsustainable asset management basically deals with \nthe business process, human resources and \ninformation technology system. In whatever task we \nperform, the business process must be there and in \nensuring it is well implemented, we need various \nlevels and competency of team members. It is not a \none man show. As we are now living in the \nmillennium era, Information Technology (IT) is in \nevery business process. Data needs to be converted \ninto information and IT makes this happen within a \nclick. (Che Ani,Badaruzzaman, 2010)\nFigure 2: Sustainable Asset Management Factors \nFrom these Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can conclude \nthat decisions making for asset replacement are based \non 3 significant factor such as of human factor,\ntechnical factor and organization factor. Generally, \nthe cost decision making are based on manager \nexperience, building condition and availability of \nfunding while the replacement cost are based on \nbudget determination, mode of government \nprocurement and existing practices of replacement. \nHowever, the detail explanation of these three key \nareas is represented in the next topic. \n3. Cost Decision Making Factors \n3.1 Human Factor \nHaving identified the best practices in business \nprocess, we need human capital in executing the idea. \nHuman are the best machines and super power \ncomputer in ensuring best practices are put in place. \nTherefore, we need team members with various \ntechnical knowledge and competence. It ranges from \nthe design team to the building management team. \nCompetency is best represented from the outcome of \nan academic programme developed by Malaysian \nQualification Agency (MQA). In our context, the \nDecision Making \n(1) Organization (2) Technical (3)Manager \nSustainable Asset Management \n(1) Business Process (2) Information System (3)Human Resources \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n3\n", "professional services involve the professions of \nArchitect, Engineer, Quantity Surveyor, Valuation \nSurveyor, Town Planner, Landscape Architect, Land \nSurveyor, Interior Architecture and Building \nSurveyor. All these professional services contribute \nto the different factor in cost decision making. (Che \nAni,Badaruzzaman, 2010) The following are details \nof human factors that contribute to the cost decision \nmaking:  \n3.1.1 Past Experiences or Manager Experience \nPast experience can impact future decision making. \nJuliusson, Karlsson and Garling (2005) indicated \npast decisions influence the decisions people make in \nthe future. It stands to reason that when something \npositive results from decision, people are more likely \nto decide in a similar way, given a similar situation. \n3.1.2 Age & Individual Differences \nSome individual differences may also influence \ndecision making. Research has indicated that age, \nsocioeconomic status, and cognitive abilities \ninfluences decision making (De Bruin, Parker & \nFischoff, 2007; Finucane, Mertz, Slovic &Schmidt, \n2005). Finucace et. al established a significant \ndifferent in decision making across age; that is; as \ncognitive  functions decline as a result of age, \ndecision making performance may decline as well. In \naddition, older people may be more overconfident \nregarding their ability to make decisions, which \ninhibits their ability to apply strategies (De Bruin et \nal, 2007). Finally, with respect to age, there is \nevidence to support the notion that older adults prefer \nfewer choices than younger adults. ( Reed, Mikels & \nSimon, 2008)\n3.1.3 Belief in Personal Relevance \nWhen people belief what they decide matters, they \nare more likely to make a decision. Acevedo and \nKrueger (2004) examined individuals' voting pattern, \nand concluded that people will vote more readily \nwhen they believe their opinion is indicative of the \nattitude of the general population as well as when \nthey have a regard for their own importance in the \noutcomes. People vote when they believe their vote \ncounts. Acevedo and Krueger pointed out this voting \nphenomenon is ironic; when more people vote, the \nindividual votes countless in electoral math. \n3.1.4 Escalation of Commitment \nIn addition to past experiences and cognitive biases, \ndecision making may be influenced by an escalation \nof commitment and sunk outcomes, which are \nunrecoverable costs. Juliusson, Karlsson and Garling \n(2005) concluded people make decisions based on an \nirrational escalation of commitment, that is, \nindividuals invest larger amounts of time, money and \neffort into a decision to which they feel responsible \nfor the sunk costs, time, money, and effort spent on a \nproject. As a results, decision making may at times be \ninfluenced by how far in the hole the individual feels \nhe or she is (Juliusson et al, 2005)\n3.1.5 Client Request \nClient refers to the owner of a building. The client is \nthe one who provides maintenance finance and \nproject brief in the early stage of maintenance works. \nQuality of client's brief would influence the building \nperformance. Boyle (2003) notes that the key \nsuccessful of design is rests much with the clients \nbesides others such as a good budget. \n3.1.6 Complaint Received Regarding Building \nPerformance \nInefficient maintenance works could invite \ncomplaints by the building users. Users are normally \nlooking for a comfortable space in a building. This \nincludes well functions of building equipmentâs,\nclean environment and safe. If buildings do not fulfil \nthe user's needs, complaints with regards to \nmaintenance performance would be made by the \nusers. Therefore, in formulating decision with regards \nto maintenance cost, element of user's satisfaction is \nvital and need to take into consideration (Latef,2008; \nPWD,2009)\n3.2 Technical Factor\nThe asset management cycle covers planning until \nthe disposal stage (or adaptive re use). In the global \narena, various theories and tools have been developed \nto support this idea. Among them are Building \nPerformance Evaluation (BPE), Construction \nOperations Building Information Exchange (COBIE), \nBuildings Information Modelling (BIM) and Return \non Investment (ROI). Others technical factor that \ncontribute to the cost decision making are as follow: \n3.2.1 Existing Building Condition \nThe existing conditions of buildings were assessed \nthrough several ways. One of the easiest methods is\nby using viral survey. The exterior of each building \nstructure was viewed from the ground level and all \nimportant information would be documented and \nsome areas of deterioration are noted through \nannotated sketches and plans. However, with recent \nnew technology, detecting building defects would be \n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n4\n", "more effective by implementing non-destructive test \n(Pitt,1997; Lee and Scott,2009) \n3.2.2 Building Age\nAge of building provides important indication on \nlevel of maintenance service required. Lateef (2008)\nargues that one of the important elements that need to \nbe considered in allocation of maintenance resources \nis building's age. In order to know the future image of \nbuilding, building manager needs to offer right \nservice so that the building has competitive \nadvantage. Service given must meet expectation in \nresponse to time, delivery schedules and within the \nagreed performance indicator. In general, the older is \nbuilding, the more attention and focus to special \nmaintenance works need to be carried out. \n3.2.3 Performance Evaluation  \nThe best decision on whether to repair or replace can \nonly be reached by evaluating the equipment in the \nbroadest possible terms. For example, when \nconsidering whether to refurbish or replace a piece of \npumping equipment, looking at the performance of  \nassociated motors and drives- their function, lifespan \nand cost of replacement- can help engineers to \nunderstand how the pump is performing in relation to \nthe wider system. (2015, Conference of Pumping Best \nPractice, Telford) \n3.2.4 Energy Efficiency \nIn order to fully incorporate sustainability into the \ndecision making process, maintenance teams should \nevaluate the ongoing energy efficiency performance \nof an asset as well as the immediate environmental \nimpact of repairing or replacing it. Then the \nenvironmental impact of their versus replacement can \nbe measured by carrying out a calculation on the \nenergy usage and the direct link between this, and the \nasset's carbon footprint, by focusing on reducing \nspecific power. \nThe decision to repair or replace is not always a \nstraightforward one. However, by working alongside \nan asset management and maintenance expert, it is \npossible for maintenance teams to make a fully \ninformed decision. By taking a long term view, not \nonly of the cost and performance benefits, but also \nthe environmental effects of each approach, engineers \nare well placed to make  the best decision in terms of \ncost, performance and sustainability. (2015, \nConference of Pumping Best Practice, Telford) \n3.2.5 Information Technology (IT) System \nThe myth about IT system is it will take care of every \nmechanistic task of asset management. We have to \nrealize that IT is enabler for the whole structure of \nasset management, thus providing total solution for \nsustainable asset management. It is not that when we \nhave superb IT system, everybody just stays back and \nbecome the observer. The IT system needs input to \nconvert data into information, and this is found to be \nmost lacking, leading to a white elephant project. As \na rule of thumb, engage a business partner that \nprovides total solution, rather than selling the \nsoftware and gadgets. (Che Ani,Badaruzzaman, \n2010)\n3.3 Organization Factor \nThe prime objective of the Malaysian Government \nprocurement is to support Government programmes \nby obtaining value for money through acquisition of \nworks, supplies and services. To meet this objective \nclose attention is given to price factors as well as \nnon-price factors such as whole life cost, quality, \nquantity, timeliness, maintenance and warranty. The \nbenefits or value from procurement should \ncommensurate with the costs involved and that the \nbest procurement is well and thoroughly evaluated, \nreasoned and justified. In this context, the Malaysian \nGovernment procurement is based on the following \npolicies, principles, objective and procedures. Others \norganization factor are as follow:  \n3.3.1 Availability of Funding \nA most trying constraint from the design point of \nview is the budget allocation. Boyle (2003) noted that \nmost important factor contributing to successful \nmaintenance work was a sufficient budget allocated \nfor a project. The project fund must be sufficient to \nensure the maintenance works could run smoothly. \n3.3.2 Government Policy  \nGovernment assets have to be economically managed \nso it is vital to know the opportunity cost of holding \nthem. The government wants to see the government \nheritage estate properly preserved and maintained \nthrough active use and reuse of the buildings. The \ngovernment encourage the sustainable use of \nresources, and one aspect of that is to use and reuse \nolder buildings wherever it sensible to do so. \nGovernment's planning policies are committed to \nmaintaining the vitality of town centres where many \nspecialized public listed properties are found rather \nthan erecting new buildings on greenfield sites. \n(Anthony Andrew, 2000)\n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n5\n", '3.3.3 Safety & Health Requirement \nSafety and health are command factors influenced in \nthe decision making of maintenance works (Lee and \nScott, 2009). This is because building maintenance \nworks can lead a risk to maintenance personnel and \nbuilding users. It is the responsibility of building \nstakeholders particularly the manager to ensure that \nhealth and safety assessment and safety work \nprocedure are documented. \n3.3.4 Past Experience and Past Performance \nAnalysis on Malaysia scenario in development of \nbuilding and facilities aspect from First National \nPhysical Plan (NPP) in 1956 until 10th Malaysia Plan \nin 2015. Performance and achievement of these plans \nas a guideline to the future planning. \n3.3.5 Informed Decision Making \nAn invaluable part of any asset management \nprogramme is having a system in place to monitor \nand evaluate the ongoing performance of an asset. By \nmeasuring the efficiency of pumps and associated \nprocesses, engineers can understand the behaviour of \npiece of equipment and gauge when it is reaching the \nend of its lifetime or is at risk of failure. They can \nthen make an informed decision in terms of repair or \nreplacement and at the same time, include suitability \nof the asset and improve asset and system efficiency.\n(2015, Conference of Pumping Best Practice, \nTelford) \n4. Replacement Cost Factors \nReplacement cost definition is the amount it would \ncost to replace an asset at current prices. If the cost of \nreplacing an asset in its current physical condition is \nlower than the cost of replacing the asset so as to \nobtain the level of services enjoyed when the asset \nwas bought, then the asset is in poor condition and \nthe firm would probably not want to replace it. \n4.1 Mode of Government Procurement \n4.1.1 Direct Purchase \nProcurement of works up to the value of RM20,000 \nmay be done through the issue of a Works Indent to a \ncontractor who is registered with the Contractors \nServices Centre (PKK) and Construction Industry \nDevelopment Board (CIDB) Malaysia. \n4.1.2 Quotation \nProcurement of works above the value of RM20,000 \nand up to RM500,000 is done through calling of \nquotations and the minimum number of quotations to \nbe invited is five. All contractors wishing to take part \nin quotations must be registered with the PKK and \nCIDB. \n4.1.3 Tenders \nProcurement of works, supplies and services above \nthe value of RM500,000 must be done through tender \nprocesses. All contractors intending to participate in \nlocal tenders must be registered with the government. \nInternational tenders will be invited for supplies and \nservices if there are no locally produced supplies or \nservices available. For specific works, if local \ncontractors do not have the expertise and capability, \ntenders may be called on a joint venture basis \nbetween local and foreign contractors to encourage \nthe transfer of technology. International tenders for \nworks may only be called when local contractors do \nnot have the expertise and capability, and a joint \nventure is not possible. (2015, Malaysia\'s \nGovernment Procurement Policies) \n4.2 Budget Determination\nThe Prime Minister Department has given an \ninstruction under the "Pekeliling Am Bil. 1 Tahun \n2003, Arahan Penyelengaraan Bangunan Kerajaan \ndi Putrajaya dated February 11th 2003," building \nmaintenances must be efficiently and properly \nexecuted. The Government has also given \ninstructions to all their agencies to carry out \nmaintenances of all their building in the very early \nstage so that to reduce the cost of maintenance and to \navoid risk of higher maintenance cost due to \nnegligent through time. \n4.3 Existing Practices of Replacement Cost \nin Government  \nThe Malaysia industry reference point for asset \nmanagement has to be the TAM Manual (Total Aset \nManagement Manual), part of DPAK (Dasar \nPengurusan Aset Kerajaan). Launched in April 2009 \nby former Prime Minister Y.A.B. Dato\' Seri Abdullah \nHj. Ahmad Badawi, this document provides the key \nidea and direction for the whole life cycle of our \nassets. According to the manual, asset refer to \nmoveable assets (aset alih), fixed assets (aset tidak \nalih), life asset (aset hidup) and intellectual property \n(harta intelek). With the wide coverage of assets, an \nasset management team is no longer focused on \n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n6\n', "building only. It has to be integrated to achieve the \naspiration of TAM Manual.  \n As for the federal government, there is no \nstandard format to be called standard operating \nprocedure to be followed as a guide or a blueprint to \nthe entire public client in terms of cost analysis of\nbuilding replacement. However, the existing practices \nof building replacements in government are as \nfollow:    \n\x02 TATACARA PENGURUSAN ASET TAK \nALIH KERAJAAN 2012:  Procedure that \nhave been used by government as a \nguideline in asset disposal. The details of the \nprocedure are in the Bab G: Pelupusan Aset.\n\x02 SYOR ROBOH: One of the procedure and \nguidelines that have been used by \ngovernment in asset disposal. \n\x02 BCA (Building Condition Assessment): \nCondition assessments are technical \ninspections by competent assessors to \nevaluate the physical state of building \nelements and services and to assess the \nmaintenance needs of the facility. Reliable \nand objective knowledge of the physical \nstate of their buildings and the impacts on \nservice delivery will enable department to \ndevelop appropriate strategies and actions \nfor maintenance, major replacements, \nrefurbishments and investment. \n\x02 BIM (Building Information Modelling): \nThis model is an approach to design that \nuses intelligent 3D computer models to \ncreate, modify, share, and coordinate \ninformation throughout the design process. \nMany firms are using BIM to drive a more \nefficient design process. \n\x02 LCC Model (Life Cycle Costing): LCC \nmodel is an accounting structure containing \nterms and factors which enable estimation of \nan asset's component costs. A number of \ncommercially available models can be used \nfor LCC analysis. However, in some cases it \nmay be appropriate to develop a model for a \nspecific application. \n\x02 CMMS: Model can produce status reports \nand documents giving details or summaries \nof maintenance activities. The more \nsophisticated the package, the more analysis \nfacilities are available. \n\x02 Value Engineering: Value techniques that \nare adopted during the detailed design stage \nand in some cases at the construction stage \nwhen completed design or elements of the \ndesign is made available for study. \n\x02 J10: This model is an IT project which when \ncompleted, will bring the department's \nproject management and facilities \nmanagement business applications together \nonto a single platform with a simple and \nefficient user interface. The platform and \napplications will leverage current\ntechnology to automate certain takes and \nimprove usability for end users. This is the \nlatest model that has been launched in year \n2015.\n5. Methodology \nThe processes involved in this study are summarized \nin Table 2. It illustrates three distinct levels of data \ncollection, namely the first stage followed by the \nsecond stage and ended up with the third stage. The \nfirst stage was based on primary data collected from \npublished books, research papers, seminar papers and \njournals while second phase used objective data from \nofficial sources of government experts. The third or \nfinal phase used subjective data from the actual \nreplacement cost for Heat, Ventilation and Air \nConditioning (HVAC) system in building. \nTable 2: Methodology of Study \nStage 1\nStage 2\nStage 3\nFactors \nCollection\nValidation of Factors and \nEstablish Relationship\nDevelopment of Actual Replacement\n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n7\n", "CDM Factors\nRC Factors\nAsset Modeling\nExisting practice\nPolicy\nIssues\n(Primary Data)\nBased on Actual Data from \nInterviews  of Government Experts \n(Objective Data)\nActual Replacement of HVAC System of Building\n(Subjective Data)\n The first stage concentrated on literature review \non cost decision making factors and replacement cost \nfactors that related to study. The first stage was based \non primary data collected from published books, \nresearch papers, seminar papers and journals. The \nobjective of the first stage is to identify independent \nvariables that have significant relationship with the \nreplacement cost, to evaluate current level of \nreplacement cost, to established relationship between \nreplacement cost and sets of independent variables \nand to determine the relative importance of each \nindependent variable.\n The second stage was conducted upon completion \nof the first stage with the following objectives to \nvalidate factors in stage 1 and to establish \nrelationship between cost decision making and \nreplacement cost. Validating a factor is a process that \nstarts with the researcher, who then seeks validation \namong experts. The interviews conducted with the \nquestionnaire survey consisted of variables thought to \nhave effects on project's replacement cost to obtain \ndetailed investigation information of the building \nreplacement during their life cycle. The study \nadopted closed and open interviews in order to tap as  \nmuch as possible information form parties \ninterviewed. In this study, 11 personnel experts in the \ngovernment office have been interviewed. The results \nof the interview data are presented in the Table 3. \nThe third or final stage was based subjective data on \npilot projects of development of replacement cost \nmodelling for Heat, Ventilation and Air Conditioning \n(HVAC) system in buildings. The objectives of the \nthird stage were to investigate to what extent the \nfactors identified in the earlier phases had affected \nprojects selected under the pilot studies, to identify \nother factors that could contribute to the replacement \ncost in project selected under the pilot studies. The \npilot studies adopted closed and open interviews in \norder to tap as much as possible information from \nparties interviewed.

Discussion \n6.1 Result and Analysis  \nThe aim of this phase is to identify the expertâs\nresponses on critical improvement and critical \ndevelopment in decision making of whether to \nretrofit or to rebuild the building. Based on the Table \n3, 'Competency of Manager' and 'Information \nDatabase' are most important in improvement of \ndecision making in building replacement, followed \nby âDecision Making Modelâ. Their distribution are \nas follow; Competency (3), Information Database (3), \nDecision Making Model (2), Funding Availability \n(1), Computerized System(1) Policy Improvement(1).  \nFurthermore, Refer to Table 3, their contribution on \ntheoretical framework are as follow: Human Factor \n(3), Technical Factor (2) and Organization Factor (6). \nOrganization factor are contribute 55% of the \nimprovement requirement and Human Factor (27%) \nand Technical Factor (18%).  Therefore, from this \nanalysis, the 3 critical factors are need improvement \nare as follow which contributed 73% of improvement \nof decision making: \n1. Competency of Manager (27%) \n2. Information Database (27%) \n3. Decision Making Model (18%) \n The study will focus on to improve the current \npolicy that is being implementing by the government. \nThis will include on how the Government make the \nanalysis and make determination of the final decision \n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n9\n", "on replacement of 'Heat, Ventilation and Air \nConditioning' (HVAC) system. This study will \npresent several factors, issues and figures. The \nelements of studies that will be put into consideration \nand to be analysed are the Replacement Cost (RC) \nfactors and Cost Decision Making (CDM) factors as\nFigure 3 below. The study is meant to help the public \nsector which forms the biggest part of the buildings \nmanaging authorities in facing all the problems and \ndifficulties. There are buildings with special design \ncharacteristic and with special function, unfortunately \nthese specialty are normally costly to replace.  These \nare normally due to deterioration and aging factor. \nTherefore it is urgent that a thorough study should be \ncarried out to develop a guideline for the \ndetermination of replacement cost on these special \nbuildings.\nFigure 3: Relationship between Decision Making and Replacement \n6.2 Discussion \nThe significance reason of this study is how to \nprovide evidence in order to help the Federal \nGovernment to make a final decision on whether to \nrestore or rebuild existing HVAC system. The figure \nshows the simple model to show the relationship \nbetween decision making and replacement cost.  By \nusing the model that will be proposed, it is hope that \nthis evidences contributed to select optimum \nreplacement cost for certain projects and directly \nhelping in tendering process and ensuring the \nappropriate and transparency of job done.  \nCOST DECISION \nMAKING\nREPLACEMENT COST\nAge of equipment\nCost of repair\nWarranty coverage\nMoney saving \nefficiency\nFuture refrigerant \navailability\nLong term comfort\nLong term savings\nDependable comfort\nCompressor\nCondenser Coils\nEvaporator Coils\nAir Filter\nCoil Fins\nContactor Relays\nTime Delay\nCompressor Power Pack\n \nDecision Making Model \nTECHNICAL \nExisting Practice \n \nInformation Database \nORGANIZATION \nMode of Procurement \n \nManager Competency \nHUMAN \nBudget Determination \nDecision Making \nReplacement \n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n10\nFigure 4: Replacement Cost Modeling For HVAC \nAsset \n", "Refer to Figure 4, this HVAC asset study will \nprovide more details and relevant information of \nrelationship between Cost Decision Making (CDM) \nand Replacement Cost (RC). Cost Decision Making \nconsists of 3 factors such as human factor, technical \nfactor and organization factor.  Meanwhile, \nReplacement Cost factors related to modes of \ngovernment procurement, budget determination and \nlatest IT software application. This relationship study \nand discussion will contribute to the theoretical \nsaving framework or saving policy that can save the \ngovernment expenses. However, this theoretical \nframework only can be proof through actual analysis \nstudy on pilot projects of government procurement.  \nTherefore, the author focus on HVAC System of \nbuilding as pilot projects of this study. \n Actually, the main objective of this study is to \nprovide evidences to support a concept that restore of \nexisting building are more benefit than replacement \nor rebuild to the new ones. The scope of the project \nand the key features of the asset of HVAC system of \nbuilding are chiller, motor, compressor, cooling \ntower and piping. An air conditioner is any type of \ndevice that helps moderate temperature indoors. An \nair conditioner does not have to be cooling system; \ntechnically a heater is also an air conditioner, though \nmost people seem to only consider air conditioners \nmachines that lower the temperature to a user defined \ntemperature.  Making the decision to either repair \nyour old building or replace with a new building is \nnot easy. It's a decision government need to make \nevery time. Government need to make a thoughtful, \nwell informed and final decision making. Therefore, \ngovernment need to developed all relevant \nperformance and quality requirements such as age of \nequipment, cost of repair, warranty coverage, money \nsaving efficiency, future refrigerant availability, long \nterm comfort, long term savings and dependable \ncomfort. Furthermore, part of asset that are subject to \na costs analysis are compressor, condenser coils, \nevaporator coils, air filters, coil fins, contactor relays, \ntime delay, compressor power pack and other \nmechanical parts. Optimum replacement cost that \nproduced from this discussion hopefully can help \ngovernment to make a justify decision. \n7. Conclusion \nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that this study is \ncompulsory to be done by authorities in order to \nmake sure the consistencies of decision making of \ngovernment building replacement. Their life cycle \nmanagement should be transparent and cost efficient, \nand decisions taken during the life cycle should be \nbased on clear, justified and rational grounds. \nTherefore, the model is adapted to specific costs of \nsuch buildings towards transparency of their \nreplacement.  \n From the questionnaire, we can conclude that the \nlack of cost analysis in decision making of building \nreplacement as a weak point in the existing practices. \nImprovement of this process is compulsory to be \ndone by authorities in order to make sure the \ntransparency of decision making of government \nbuilding replacement. Therefore, this study focuses to \nestablish a simple, transparent and robust model that \ncan be easily understood and used by the decision \nmakers in practice. \n Next analysis is which replacement is more \nbenefit to the government in term of cost, retrofit or \nrebuild. Experts have to choose one and give their \nopinion on this question. Most the experts said the \nanswer 'yes or no' are depend on the purpose of \nfunction of the building and specialty of the building. \nAs for example, the heritage building should not be \nrebuild in order to maintain its original heritage \ncriteria and history value. However, the experts gave \ntheir opinion are based on their experiences in \ndealing with this situation. \n Based on the data Table 3, seven (7) experts said \nthat retrofit is more benefit to the government \nmeanwhile four (4) experts said that rebuild is more \nbenefit to government expenses. Generally, about \n64% of experts agreed that retrofit is more \neconomically than rebuild to the new ones. Actually, \nthe reason  to choose retrofit are because of retrofit is \nmore cheaper in term of cost, can increase \ncompetency of the manager, to maintain the heritage \nand valuable building, to minimize the residue\nmaterial and to minimize impact to the environment. \nOtherwise, the reasons to choose rebuild are because \nof the business changes, to minimize security risk and \nfatalities, lack of database information and the \nexpected life of the building. \n Lastly, all the experts give the same opinion on \nthe current implementation of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) \nfor government building. There is no implementation \nof LCC in current practice for government building.  \nImplementation of this process is compulsory to be \ndone by authorities in order to achieve sustainable \nasset management. Finally and hopefully, the \nimplementation of Life Cycle Costing (LCC) for \ngovernment building will become a reality\n \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/00036 (2016), matecconf/2016MATEC Web of Conferences 66 6\nIBCC 2016\n600036\n11\n", " \n \nReferences \n1.
