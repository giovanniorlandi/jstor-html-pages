        <pre>['—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 41 —\nI\nThe Factory of Life\nAs a factory, the factory is right. As life, the factory is a flop.95\n–Viktor Shklovskii, Third Factory\n \nKostia, the main criminal character in Nikolai Pogodin’s Belomor-based \nplay The Aristocrats (Aristokraty, 1934), acts out numerous identities in \nboth the thieving and the laboring worlds. Upon his arrival at the prison \ncamp, Kostia makes apparent these many personalities: “About this registration—let’s\nsee, what name was I tried under? Blium? Ovchinikov? \nMy biography has gotten all mixed up. What kind of questions are \nthese? I’ll register myself under my father’s name. Kostia Dorokhov.”96 \nSimilar to how he assumed various identities in the criminal world, \nKostia (who actually goes by the klichka, or nickname, “Captain”) also \nadopts different personalities at the labor camp. He pretends to be an \nengineer, an aviator, and even an electrician in his humorous efforts to \ndupe fellow prisoners and officials into procuring illegal goods for him. \nWhen Kostia is eventually “re-forged” into an upstanding Soviet citizen \nat the end of the play, he dramatically drops all assumed names and \ncriminal sobriquets: “I ask you to remember—my surname is Dorokhov, \nmy name is Konstantin Konstantinovich. Criminal nicknames are not \nto be used from this day on. Konstantin Konstantinovich.”97 Real-life \ncriminals also depend on theatricality for material advantages, convincing\nruses, and the evasion of authorities. Beggars in particular need to \nhave dramatic yet believable performances while plying their trade.98 \nPerformance, therefore, has a strong link to the criminal realm, blurring \nthe line between reality and theatricality. At Belomor, the most grandiose\nperformance was that of perekovka—the re-forging of common \ncriminal to New Soviet Man. \nThe penal philosophy of perekova promoted at the construction of \nStalin’s White Sea-Baltic Canal (Belomorkso-Baltiiskii kanal im. Stalina) \nsought to remake lives against a backdrop of destruction. This teleol-\n', '— 42 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nogy was rooted in the OGPU’s99 desire to mold criminal prisoners into \ndedicated believers of Soviet ideology, and thus rendered Belomor one \nof the most infamous forced-labor projects. Perekovka was ubiquitous \nat the camp: criminal prisoners wrote of their transformations in autobiographical\nsketches; the camp newspaper was named in its honor; \nand poetry and plays were dedicated to its grandiose potential. By invoking\nthe smelting of metal, the term perekovka adeptly highlighted \nthe industrial atmosphere of Stalin’s first Five-Year Plan and asserted \nthat people—along with factories, plants, and waterways—could be \nbuilt according to a master design. While it is possible to question the \nlegitimacy of the process as a whole and the veracity of the declarations \nof allegiance to it, the phenomenon plays an essential role in cultural \nnarratives emerging from the project and must be examined as such.100 \nCriminal autobiographies housed in Moscow archives narrativize the \nprocess of perekovka and document the path, or put’, of their authors’ \ntransformations.101 The notion of pathway is essential in these tales, and \ncalls to attention the religiosity inherent in Marxist-Leninist doctrine. \nIn both Western and non-Western religions, to find God one must follow\na path. The ritual of pilgrimage analogizes the metaphorical journey \nto enlightenment with an actual, physical journey. Prisoners laboring \nat Belomor experienced both literal and metaphorical pilgrimage: first \nthe prisoners had to travel the difficult road to the camp site—a horrific \nvoyage often described in prisoner memoirs as more arduous than the \nexperience of prison life itself102—and then they were forced to experience\nthe metaphorical voyage of re-forging, a trip intended to transport \nthem from the darkness of the criminal world to the light of socialist \nlabor. \nYet several elements render the Soviet brand of conversion unique, \ndistinct from its religious counterparts. While finding God in Christian \nand other traditions can be a lifelong process, re-forging at the White \nSea-Baltic Canal—as described by prisoners and camp officials—often \nhappened literally overnight. The immediacy of transformation alludes \nto the industrial component inherent in the Soviet re-fashioning of \nreligion (the spontaneity of a metallurgical process) and also brings \ninto question the conversions’ legitimacy. In addition, the trope of the \npathway is apparent not only in socialist conversion narratives: prisoners’\nfall into the criminal world often serves as a counterpoint to their \nascent into socialist society. Despite their very different destinations, \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 43 —\nthe two routes share important qualities: the substitution of an artificial \nfamily for its biological counterpart and the role of collective identity in \nforming individual consciousness. The transformative journey of perekovka\nechoes elements of the socialist realist master plot, itself laden \nwith ritualistic attributes. As Katerina Clark has outlined in her classic \nwork The Soviet Novel: History as Ritual, the production novel, which \ncharts how a plan is fulfilled or a project is constructed, exemplifies the \nmaster plot.103 In this highly ritualistic plot construction, the hero arrives\nat the worksite and is presented with a specific, challenging task to \nfulfill. While there are trials or mishaps along the way, the hero eventually\nfulfills the task and completes the journey to consciousness, often \nwith the help of a mentor to guide them along the path. At Belomor, the \nhero is the criminal who arrives at the separate, enclosed world of the \nGulag camp. The task is the construction of the canal, a building process \nechoed metaphorically by the reconstruction of the criminal’s personality.\nThe mentor developed in classic socialist realist texts is mirrored \nby the vospitatel’, or educator-reformer, a figure who is paramount in \nfacilitating the re-forging of the criminal. The vospitatel’ helps the criminal\njourney along the path towards perekovka and ultimately allows the \nconvict to achieve the task. Such a mentor figure is also present in the \ncriminals’ stories about their past lives—having a “mentor” to inaugurate\none into a life of crime is just as important as having an educator \nfor socialist conversion. Historically, fictional Russian bandits were \n“condemned to an orphan’s life, with comrades in crime serving as a \npoor substitute for true kin.”104 While communist autobiographies have \npreviously been interpreted as conversion narratives,105 it is significant \nhere that the conversion goes both ways utilizing the same tropes—a \ncriminal falls into a life of crime with an “educator” just as he or she \ntransforms into a conscious citizen with the help of one.106\nThe Mechanics of Perekovka\nThe KVO (kul’turno-vospitatel’nyi otdel) at the White Sea-Baltic Canal \nwas in charge of re-forging prisoners as well as all other aspects of the \nre-educational process: it helped to abolish illiteracy among the convicts,\norganized professional-technical courses for the re-training of \nthe incarcerated, maintained the "red corners" (areas in a room used \nfor focusing attention on Soviet leaders and ideology in the barracks), \n', '— 44 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nand established social and recreational groups for the prisoners.107 The \ndepartment was divided into sub-divisions, or chasti, each of which was \nheaded by a different vospitatel’. The vospitateli were key figures on the \ncanal and were frequently mentioned in prisoner autobiographies and \nstories. They were directly in charge of remaking criminals’ consciences, \nserving as true “engineers of the human soul,”108 to echo Stalin’s famous \nstatement on the role of writers in the Soviet Union. The authorities, \nin turn, encouraged vospitateli to pen their own autobiographies, which \nwere intended to serve as inspiration for recalcitrant prisoners. Part of \nthe reason behind the apparent success of this method was due to the \nfact that the call to work and evidence of transformation came directly \nfrom former criminals rather than members of the administration.109 \nNevertheless, such successes must be qualified, as a thief-turnedreformer\noften could take advantage of his or her “privileged” position \nto indulge more readily in drunkenness and card-playing; as the political \nprisoner Dmitrii Vitkovskii recalls, “Usually the educators (vospitateli) \nwithdraw into an attic in some or another barrack, play cards, eventually \nmanage to get drunk and enjoy various thieves’ amusements.”110 This \nobservation makes apparent a certain inability to control the thievesturned-reformers\nwho, in the rearranged realm of Belomor, actually \nenjoyed a certain level of freedom in a prison camp. It is important to \nremember that the vospitateli are prisoners themselves, and the camp \nofficials clearly could not control them nor prevent them from getting \ndrunk.\nThe volume From Crime to Labor (Ot prestupleniia k trudu, 1936), a \nsort of bible of Soviet penal philosophy, offers insight into the process \nof perekovka as a specifically pedagogical phenomenon. The prisoners \ngo through the “school of the Belomor construction” and have an important\ninfluence on the workers at the Moscow-Volga Canal, a subse-\nquent Gulag project run by the OGPU.111 Chapters focus on remaking \nprisoners’ attitudes, the organization of cultural-educational work, \nthe importance of collectivity as a work principle, and udarnichestvo \n(shock-worker labor) as a method of work stimulation—all of which \nwere key components of the Belomor program. Most importantly, as \nthe volume argues, perekovka concerns the transformation of human \nconsciousness, and prison is not simply a tool for punishment or economic\ngain.112 This idea did not make a sudden appearance in the 1930s; \nthe Bolsheviks believed that crime was solely a byproduct of an unjust \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 45 —\nsocial system,113 and that the reformation of all prisoners was possible, \nwhich is why a maximum sentence of five years was originally sought \nfor all criminal offenses.114 Some scholars argue that “years of Gulag \npropaganda” stressed that “prisoners were temporarily isolated from \nsociety but could be reeducated and reintegrated into that society”115 \nand that the potential for prisoner reeducation persisted long past the \nconstruction of the Belomor Canal. The malleability of human nature, \nso central in Marxist philosophy and Lenin’s subsequent adaptation of \nit, lends credence to the argument that belief in the possibility of human\ntransformation existed throughout the Soviet Union. \nLenin, therefore, actively supported research on the criminal realm \nin the 1920s and sought to create Soviet specialists in criminology. \nThe Moscow Soviet created the Moscow Bureau for the Study of the \nCriminal Personality and Crime (Moskovskii kabinet po izucheniiu lichnosti \nprestupnika i prestupnosti) in 1923 in an attempt to understand and preFigure\n6. Slogans and banners at the White Sea-Baltic Canal. The banner across the top reads, “The \nUSSR’s corrective-labor politics does not punish, but rather corrects on the basis of socially beneficial \nlabor and political re-education.” Note also the portrait of Lenin.

While such \nSoviet organizations tried to understand crime as a scientific phenomenon,\nhistorically the Russian people had a long tradition of sympathy \nto thieves. Given the weak sense of private property in the countryside, \nnineteenth-century Russian peasants might actually applaud theft, particularly\nif the victims were outsiders. The large-scale thieving by the \nBolsheviks in the name of the revolution, in turn, continued the tradition\nof sanctioned crime.116 Yet with the growing menace of criminals \nunder Stalin, and the potential for even common criminals to be understood\nas hooligans disrupting the political order, any soft approach to \ncrime largely dissipated in the mid-1930s.117\nIn the flattering portrayal of the Soviet system in the 1936 volume \nFrom Crime to Labor, the penal methods of the USSR are compared to \nthose of capitalist countries. While Fascist Germany presents crime as \nsomething inborn and thus impossible to change, the Soviet Union, \nthe book claims, believes in the possibility of reforming even the most \ndifficult portions of the population.118 The Soviet penal system is also \ncontrasted to its Tsarist precedent, with images of whips and bodily \npunishment meant to drive home for the reader the high degree of cruelty\nin pre-revolutionary Russia.119 According to the volume, and as the \ntitle makes evident, the key to reformation was hard physical labor. That \nlabor was most effective when it could be done on large construction \nprojects with a concentrated group of prisoners, such as with the White \nSea-Baltic Canal or Moscow-Volga Canal.120 The prison site, therefore, \nbecomes a perpetuum mobile of perekovka: the criminals’ labor fires the \nforge in which they are re-forged. The physicality of convict labor mirrors\nthe violence of the prisoners’ re-forging; in both, something new \nmust be hammered into shape, using heat, fire, and sweat. The stress on \na strict work ethic—and its supposed benefits—has a chilling resonance \nwith the infamous German slogan “Arbeit macht frei” (“work makes you \nfree”) of the Nazi era, and is echoed in the Soviet labor slogan published \non the front page of every camp newspaper: “Labor in the USSR is a matter\nof honesty, glory, valor, and heroism.”121 While the sentiments of the \ntwo slogans are similar, their application is vastly different. Very little \nlabor occurred in Nazi concentration camps, and the idea of a factory \nwas a poor disguise for the Germans’ ultimate goal—total annihilation. \nGiven the horrific and inescapable fate of Nazi camp victims, there was \nlittle effort made to maintain the prisoners’ health and cultural educa-\n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 47 —\ntion. Yet in the Soviet context, camp administrations often relied on \nthe inmates as a vital supply of inexpensive labor during a time of rapid \nindustrialization. Keeping convicts at least moderately well-fed and \nwell-clothed was of importance to those who ran the camps, although \nthe definitions of well-fed and well-clothed could vary dramatically. The \nemphasis on labor and its transformative potential was a very real phenomenon\nin the Soviet Union. \nWhile there are limitations to comparing Hitler’s concentration camps \nwith Stalin’s Gulag,122 it is also important to examine the potential connections\nbetween the Nazi and Soviet camps, especially given the present \nmonograph’s focus on creativity in the wake of destruction. If one emphasizes\nthe role of the Gulag as a machine of political repression—not its \nonly characteristic, since the camps have an economic function (however \nfaulty), whereas Nazi concentration camps had virtually no profitable \ncomponent—the comparison has some weight. There has been a revival \nin this debate in recent years, and current scholarship focuses not on the \nidea of totalitarianism as shared ideology but rather on numerous other \ncommon characteristics of the two regimes—violence, propaganda techniques,\nsurveillance politics, antisemitism—and their critical impacts \non twentieth-century history. The violent acceleration endemic to both \nsystems has been interpreted as a dynamic between heroic reconstruction \nand aggressive self-destruction, a reading that mirrors the core thesis of \nthis book. Both regimes create a tangible sense of belonging for approved \ncitizens while revealing the prevalence of violence endemic to the larger \nsocial sphere. 123 The Gulag’s existence augmented—or at least revealed—\nthe already extant social violence in the country. \nThe connection between art and incarceration in the two penal systems\nmust also be noted; while aesthetics are important to both, the roles \nare often different. It is more common to appreciate art from concentration\ncamps in a purely heroic manner—in seemingly unimaginable con-\nditions, art, poetry, and plays were produced.124 Freidl Dicker-Brandeis, \na prominent Jewish artist ensnared in the fatal abyss of Terezin, writes, \n“Aesthetics are the ultimate authority, the moving force, the motor \ncapable of creating production, while defending man from forces over \nwhich he has no control.”125 In the Belomor context, such a noble and \npure role for the artistic is not possible. Given that Stalin wanted to \ncontrol the very levers of inspiration and that Belomor officials thought \nto dictate the content and tone of poetry, plays, and stories, such a sac-\n', '— 48 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nrosanct role for expression seems impossible. The vagaries of aesthetic \nexpression are complicated by the facts that prisoners did comply with \nthe directives they were given and that Soviet artists did become excited \nabout the prospect of such novel literary endeavors. It is too simplistic \nto negate the artistic value of pieces created at Belomor—or other Gulag \ncamps—merely because they are propagandistic. \nScholars of the Holocaust have noted art’s essential role as survival \ntechnique,126 a role that art certainly played in the Gulag camps as well. \nYet given the wide array of expression, uses for art, and types of camps, \nunderstanding art solely as a mechanism of resilience even in the Nazi \ncontext would be an overly romanticized and simplified view. Such an \ninterpretation presumes solidarity among the victims of the Holocaust \nand attempts to fill the black, gaping hole of horrific—and potentially \nmeaningless—violence with a heroic grand narrative.127 In both of these \nmost improbable carceral settings, artistic expression continued and, in \nsome instances, flourished. This is a phenomenon I have also observed \nwhile working in the American prison. Creative activity, it seems, is an \ninevitable product of incarceration. \nCrime and the Violent Application of Perekovka\nIn the disorienting shift from an old world to a new society, the crime \nrate in Russia rose nearly four hundred percent after the 1917 revolutions.128\nThe Bolshevik government took an increased interest in the \ncauses of such transgressions, setting up the Moscow Bureau for the \nStudy of the Criminal Personality and Crime in 1923 and releasing the \ninstitute’s research.129 One of the first projects to emerge from this institution,\nthe volume  Moscow’s Criminal World (Prestupnyi mir Moskvy, \n1924), highlighted the difference between the Russian approach and \nthose of more traditional criminologists. “If Professor Lombroso [the \nfamous Italian criminologist] created the theory of the born criminal, \nthen we wanted to put the words criminal world in quotation marks \nwhile underlining the conditions of understanding criminality, its \nchangeability and dependence on the conditions of time and place.”130 \nPopular taste reacted to the burgeoning crime rate with an increased \nfascination with the thieves’ underworld.131 Historically, the art of crime \nin the Soviet Union was both a collective and an individual matter. On \nthe one hand, Bolshevism understood crime as a social ill caused by an \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 49 —\nunfair class structure and criminals as representative of the masses who \nsuffered such injustice. On the other hand, the prison regime recognized \nthe individual needs of specific criminals in order to tailor rehabilitation \nto personal background.132 Similarly, the ubiquitous bandit character in \nRussian popular literature had to choose between individuality’s freedom\nand membership in the collective. \nAlthough political conditions in the 1920s particularly favored the \nstudy of crime, by the early 1930s the tide was already changing. Even if \nthe regime promoted crime as something changeable, and criminals as \npeople capable of reformation, the burgeoning rate of crime—growing \never higher against the State and declining against private citizens—\nthreatened the Stalinist social order. Distinctions were made between \ninfractions of disobedience (stikhiinost), resistance (soprotivlenie), and \nopposition (oppozitsiia), and the regime came to understand crime in \ngeneral as the social equivalent to opposition to the Stalinist State.133 \nThe growing issue of crime, therefore, needed an immediate and severe \nresponse. The high number of prisoners indicted on charges of “disrupting\ncamp life and wrecking” at Belomor demonstrated this phenomenon \nof social disorder, and indicated that the camp contained a particularly \nunruly population.134 Official approaches to crime, in turn, included the \ncarrot as well as the stick.\nWhile attempting to underscore the inherent humaneness of the socialist\nmethod as opposed to the penal techniques employed in “bourgeois” \n(capitalist) countries, the volume From Crime to Labor does not refrain \nfrom acknowledging the strict discipline and physical duress in the Gulag:\nLabor in the camps is hard work, the discipline is most \nstrict and demanding. The shock-worker labor, the conscious\nrelationship to responsibility, and the genuine \nstriving towards re-forging find absolute encouragement;\nthe breaking of camp discipline, the refusal to \nwork or a lackadaisical approach to work, and even more \nimportantly, the attempts to undermine the realization \nof corrective-labor politics and the sortie by the class enemy\nmeet a decisive opposition in various forms—from \nmeasures of coercion by the camp elite to strict disciplinary\nmeasures.135 \n', '— 50 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nFollowing this ominous warning, the volume notes that the remaking\nof prisoners’ consciousness cannot be considered a philanthropic \nor sentimental endeavor; instead, the path to reformation is a “strict \nand harsh route” (once again, the notion of put’) where the “iron discipline”\nof the camp holds sway.136 As the above passage suggests, the \nclass enemy plays a particular role, demonstrating how a type of Soviet \nideological school is “in session” at the White Sea-Baltic Canal and \nother Gulag construction projects. In addition to building a canal and \nre-building themselves, the prisoners were also being indoctrinated in \n“Soviet speak”137 while in a secluded, collective laboratory where propaganda\ncould easily be disseminated and carefully controlled. The Marxist \nconception of class struggle assumed primary importance at the camp, \nand the prison’s cultural-educational division had to address political \nquestions closely.138\nFigure 7. A graphic representation of shock-worker output at the canal’s construction. Note that even \n100% is not ideal—all prisoners should be producing at 130% or higher. Photograph reproduced with \npermission of Iurii Dmitriev.\n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 51 —\nSeveral components comprised the cultural-educational work intended\nto assist in the goal of reformation of inmate consciousness through \nphysical labor. The elements of competition (sorevnovanie) and shockworker\nmentality (udarnichestvo) were essential in the implementation \nof perekovka.139 The notion of socialist competition became a key driving \nforce behind the prisoners’ labor output. Since prisoners worked together\nin brigades and phalanxes, success was a collective matter. Gulag \nofficials commented upon this phenomenon, encouraging group, rather \nthan individual, measurements of work so as to facilitate a “collective \npsychology” that was in line with Soviet ideology.140 This emphasis on \ngroup responsibility also had a secondary, pragmatic function: it made it \nvirtually impossible for prisoners to refuse to work. If a prisoner shirked \nhis work duty and held up the brigade, he would theoretically become \nashamed of his behavior, since others were working diligently alongside \nhim. Eventually, this guilt would coerce even the laziest of prisoners \ninto adopting a work ethic.141 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn discusses the system\nin his landmark Gulag novella, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich \n(Odin den’ Ivana Denisovicha, 1959): \nTo outsmart you they thought up the work squad—but \nnot a work squad like in freedom, where Ivan Ivanych \nreceives his separate pay and Petr Petrovich receives his \nseparate pay. In the camps the brigade was arranged such \nthat it was not the administration that hurried along \nprisoners, but rather the prisoners hurried along each \nother. It was like this: either you all got a bit extra or you \nall croaked. You’re not working, you bastard—because of \nyou I will be hungry? Put your guts into it, slob.142 \nThe work-for-food system institutionalized cruelty in the Gulag, making\nsurvival nearly impossible for the malnourished or feeble. \nRecords of work-fulfillment percentages were documented publicly \non chalkboards, on either the chernaia doska (black board) or the krasnaia \ndoska (red board), and graphic diagrams around the canal served as a \nconstant reminder of the inherent shame in sub-par labor output. This \ntradition continued for years in the Soviet Union, in camps as well as in \nnon-carceral work environments (see Figures 28, 29). If prisoners were \ncomplaining about the difficulty of achieving the norm or about working \n', '— 52 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nin general, other “model” convicts would work alongside them to teach \nthem a lesson—out of shame or embarrassment, the other prisoners \nwere coerced to work by example.143 Prisoners formed work brigades (or \nbrigady, smaller groups with 25-30 members) and phalanxes (or falangi, \nlarger groups consisting of 250-300 prisoners), and these teams competed\nactively, trying to outdo one another’s norm-fulfillment percent-\nages, with the standard norm unearthing 2.5 cubic meters of rock per \nday.144 The creation of work collectives was encouraged strongly by the \nauthorities; however, prisoners sentenced under article 58 (counterrevolutionary\ncrimes) were in theory not allowed to participate in these \ngroups. This demonstrates the predilection for criminal prisoners and \nmost likely augmented the animosity between the two groups.145 The \nimportance of collective work and its supposed positive effects set an example\nfor future projects, influencing the work system developed at the \nMoscow-Volga Canal.146 Workers, therefore, had multiple incentives for \nover-fulfilling their norms: increased food rations, monetary bonuses, \nand shortened prison terms (the most powerful of all motivations).147 \nRecords indicate that 59,516 prisoners’ terms were reduced upon the \ncompletion of the canal, and 12,484 prisoners were released entirely. \nMany of the remaining prisoners who survived were transferred to work \non the Moscow-Volga Canal, another Gulag construction project.148\nPerekovka was not a peaceful process. It was a violent, aggressive experiment\nin human transformation wherein a past life was annihilated \nto accommodate a new one. Mikhail Zoshchenko narrates the re-forging \nstory of the prisoner Rottenberg in the Belomor volume History of the \nConstruction in medical terms: “Now we will try a new surgery with the \nknife, that is, to cut the tissue of the surface.”149 In Maxim Gorky’s introduction\nto this all-important monograph regarding the canal’s construc-\ntion, he claims that he fights “not to kill as the bourgeoisie does, but \nrather to resurrect laboring humankind into a new life, and I will kill only \nwhen there is no longer the possibility to blot out man’s former habits of \nfeeding on the flesh and blood of people.”150 Not only is violence an inherent\ncomponent of the re-forging process, but prisoners may be met with \nviolence if they do not subject themselves to the demands of perekovka. \nA human being is physical matter that can be melded and shaped or otherwise\ntossed away: “It is immeasurably more difficult to refine human \nraw material than wood, stone, or metal.”151 Yet Lenin himself insisted \nthat the New Man must be built not with imaginary material but with \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 53 —\nthe already inherited human material of capitalism, in what is a chillingly \nfunctionalistic interpretation of personal transformation.152\nThe physical was an essential component in the creation of selfhood \nat Belomor. Jerrold Seigel’s model of the self posits three layers: the \nbiological, the social, and the reflexive.153 While the latter two are often \naddressed in scholarship regarding Stalinist culture, the first, biological, \nself must be more fully integrated into our understanding of the Soviet \nsubject. The prison camp is an ideal frame to allow for this incorporation.\nNot only was the penal philosophy of perekovka inherently physical, \nthe prisoners were also performing labor with their bodies, bodies that \nwere subject to pain and discomfort. The turn toward industrialization \n(and the implication of smelting metal contained in the term perekovka) \nfurther accentuated construction and the physical movement in which \nbodies were engaged. The industrial connotations of refashioning are essential—the\ncamp is described by prisoners as a “smithy” (kuznitsa)154 \nfor new potential. Finally, water, the very foundation of the project itself, \nrepresented a physical element that was simultaneously natural and dangerous,\npeaceful and turbid—it was both the life-giver (waterway of the \nfuture) and the life-destroyer (road of bones).\nThe word perekovka, in its very morphological structure, emphasizes \nthe notion of remaking or redoing. At Stalin’s White Sea-Baltic Canal, \neverything would be re-made: geography, industry, nature, economy, \ncountry, culture, and, of course, people. People were built parallel to the \nconstruction of the canal, and both projects were equally important.155 \nAt Belomor, the administration could make people into honest Soviet \ncitizens just as easily as they could make them into cement mixers, claims \nthe History of the Construction.156 The frequent use of the prefix “pere-” \nin the monograph reflects this near obsession with reconstruction. The \nidea of perekovka is echoed literally thousands of times while being applied\nto numerous different words and situations in the History of the \nConstruction: perestroit’ (to rebuild), pererozhdenie (re-birth), perezhit’ (to \nsurvive), perereshat’ (to change one’s mind), “rabota ikh pereuchit” (work \nwill re-teach, train them), perevypolnenie (overfulfillment), peredumat’ (to \nchange one’s mind), perechuvstvovat’ (to experience), pereshchegoliat’ (to \noutflaunt)—the list could go on and on.157 \nThe emphasis on remaking—with the prefix pere- as its vehicle—is \nso strong that there is an overall sense of forward motion in the book as \na whole. Everything is in the process of being re-done and re-made, and \n', '— 54 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nnot simply in order to make the same object or perform the same action \nover again; rather, it is to improve upon it. In this new society, old ways \nmust die in order to give birth to a new system. Birth and death are the \nbookends of life, and the majority of rituals cluster around these two \nfoundational life events. Perekovka in some ways resembled an initiation \nrite, where the old was destroyed to allow for a re-birth, with the initiation\nprocess allowing one to grasp a positive aspect within death itself.158 \nThere is also an inherent aesthetic aspect to this re-birth, since art not \nonly facilitates re-forging but also documents its occurrence afterwards. \nIn his 1933 book about the Karelian region In the Land of Unfrightened \nBirds (V kraiu nepugannykh ptits), author Mikhail Prishvin asserts that \nthis, his first book, is the “first lock of his literary canal,” a canal that \nbrought him to a new homeland.159 The canal metaphor is not coincidental.\nPrishvin was writing this book during his visit to the Belomor con-\nstruction project in 1933, where he admired the reconstruction of people \nat the labor camp. He expresses a similar sentiment in his personal diary, \nwhere he writes:\nI place value on this cause of remaking geography for \nwhat it does to many homeless, desperate, joyless people, \nwho become reborn in this creative process, and, having \nrecreated the geography of this land, find a new motherland\nfor themselves.160  \nPrishvin commends the Belomor construction project as well as \nMaxim Gorky in his volume, and he echoes the administration’s perspective\nthat through concentrated labor—labor that is a creative process—a \nprisoner can be re-forged.\nThe exposition of various personalities in the History of the Construction \ndemonstrates how people can be created and constructed, either like \na piece of art or like the building of the canal itself, since “the birth of \nthe canal goes along with the birth of man.”161 This combined aesthetictechnological\nconnotation in the re-forging of prisoners brings to mind \nthe futurist concept of “life-building” (zhiznestroenie). At the canal, “the \nnew man was created.”162 This birth of new people is accompanied by \nthe birth of a new language163 as well as the birth of the canal, since it \nis “as if Karelia itself was born along with the canal.”164 When there is \na need for certain trades or specialties, these people will be created at \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 55 —\nthe camp site alongside the project of re-forging: “You say that there \nare no cement makers here? This is true. But there are also no honest \nSoviet citizens here, so we must create both cement makers and honest \nSoviet citizens.”165 The repeated emphasis on birth renders the canal’s \nconstruction organic, making an assault on nature appear to be a natural \nphenomenon. \nPerekovka, with its goal being the “production” of new people, injects \nan industrial emphasis into the process of re-forging prisoners—an entirely\nappropriate tone given the concentration on manufacturing during \nStalin’s first Five-Year Plan. One prisoner likens the canal to a “smithy” \nwhere everyday life transforms consciousness,166 and another compares \nthe camp to a “life factory,” where people are remade like so many products\non a conveyor belt—albeit in a highly unusual way: “Yes, strange, \nunusual transformations are made here. Miraculous transformations, \nnothing about which you could even find in fairy tales.”167 Despite the industrial\novertone of perekovka, texts often portray the process as organic \nin order to make it appear more like a natural phenomenon.168 While \ncapitalist construction sites such as the Panama and Suez Canals supposedly\nrepresent a pathway to destruction, misery, and death, the White \nSea-Baltic Canal is a place of birth and beginnings, where new sounds \nand a new way of life are born; the project is both literally and figuratively\na birth canal. The emphasis on birth169 naturalizes the construction \nof the canal, allowing for the highly unnatural ideological construct of \nperekovka to take on the appearance of an organic re-birth. Naturalizing \ninitiation rites is important, since the new birth is anything but natural, \nand instead represents a societal, cultural construction.170 In the Gulag \ncomplex—where nature was plundered for its bounty and people were \ntransformed for their psyches—the Soviet Union proclaimed itself the \nvictor in the “war against nature,” and in the process a new version of \nnature was created, with its own laws, rules, and processes. In this totalizing\nyet contradictory quality, the Soviet approach differed from other \nmodernization campaigns. Not only was industry to be re-made, so were \npeople—people who were supposedly freed by the very labor that served \nas a condition of their imprisonment. \nThe process is so complete and totalizing that the “new” person \nmight not recognize the “old.” This symbolized the utter finality of the \ntransformation: “The engineer Magnitov thought about the old engineer \nMagnitov—for him this man was already a stranger.”171 The raw, physi-\n', '— 56 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\ncal acts of death and birth, in turn, are both inherent components of \nre-forging. Perekovka reveals the essential role that autobiography plays \nin the cultural narratives about Belomor; in order to articulate one’s new \nlife and devotion, it was necessary to recall where one came from and \nwho one used to be. Just as the map could assess change in landscape \nand geography, the material text of the autobiography could document \nthe change in a human being, a change that is itself understood spatially, \nin terms of a specified put’. The phenomenon echoed the construction of \nthe canal itself; like “working the rough stone,”172 building the person is \na process that happens over time: “in the creation of great new projects \nthe new great man is created.”173 \nThe production of new people privileges autobiography as narrative \nform. Maxim Gorky penned the opening and closing chapters of the collectively\nwritten History of the Construction (the only chapters to be writ-\nten individually), and he served as the editor and organizer of the volume \nas a whole. The surprising amount of miniature biographies in the volume,\ntherefore, signifies an extension of the writer’s literary ideals. In \norder to achieve perekovka, you must tell the story of who you “were” in \norder to distinguish it from the person you came to “be.” Such stories \nabound: there are biographies of the engineers Voler’ianovich, Maslov, \nand Zhuk; there are the narratives of criminal men such as Volkov and \nRottenberg and criminal women, including Iurtseva and Pavlova, and \nthere are even histories of the nachal’niki, including Frenkel’, Rapoport, \nKogan, and Firin.174 Such a preoccupation with life stories also appears in \nthe book Liudi Stalingradskogo Traktornogo, the first volume in the series \n“History of Factories and Plants” (Istoriia fabrik i zavodov). Gorky notes \nthe importance of such biographies in the introduction to the book, \nclaiming that they give a sense of the diversity of people who worked at \nthe tractor factory: \nAll of them are not literary figures, yet they managed to \nwrite their autobiographies so that I, a man of letters and \na reader, can see how the natsmen Terkel-khan learned \nto work in difficult conditions, how the Red partisan \nGalushkin cries from joy that the factory has started \nworking, I can see how Khloptunova trains girls by teaching\nthem economy and machinery.175 \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 57 —\nThis type of literature of fact—where reality can easily be embellished—lends\ncredibility to the enthusiasm for the project. It also indi-\ncates the importance of journalistic writing and the ocherk, or sketch, \nwhich was the dominant literary form during the first Five-Year Plan.176 \nThe literature of fact not only blurs the lines between fiction and reality \nbut also underscores the labor inherent in writing. Rather than a vague \nor undefined muse allowing for inspiration, here a concrete interest in \nlived reality serves as the raw material for written works. The plethora \nof writers visiting the far-flung reaches of the USSR and reporting back \non their findings demonstrates physical work and tangible employment, \nas  opposed to the “bourgeois” notion of writing from an armchair. The \naforementioned “History of Factories and Plants,” a series of publications\nthat Maxim Gorky helped to found, represents perhaps the zenith \nof the literature of fact. The series produced nearly 30 books on Soviet \nworkplaces from 1931-38, with the History of the Construction of the \nWhite Sea-Baltic Canal as one of its more infamous publications.177\nGiven the supposedly limitless potential of perekovka, the canal project\nwas intended to be more than a pedagogical experience and much \nmore than merely a collection of locks, dams, and dikes—instead, it \nrepresented life itself, a metaphorical and utopian homeland in which \nSoviet selfhood was transformed. As the prisoner Vasilii Atiasov explained\nin his autobiography, “I myself have a wife and four children and \nI once thought about them [but now] I’m happy to give everything to my \nbeloved BMS,178 it is our pride, our beauty. And here in this rock, in this \nwater, I found my happiness, my pathway to life.”179 In a quasi-religious \nmove, Atiasov was able to surrender all previous allegiances in glorious \nadoration of the canal, an appreciation that he was able to come to by \nway of a distinct path, or putevka.180 \nPath to Perekovka as Socialist Realist Master Plot\nThe New Man (novyi chelovek) was one of the key ideological concepts \nunder Stalin,181 and this omnipotent Soviet being shared many qualities \nwith the re-forged prisoner at the camp site: both abjured their past in \norder to adopt a brighter future, both came to this realization through \n“correct” ideological training and education, and both were used as metaphors\nfor the grandiosity of the Soviet Union. The creation of the New \nMan exemplified key tenets of socialist realism’s master plot, wherein \n', '— 58 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nan unreformed, uninitiated main character comes to profess a new way \nof life with the help of a tutor or trainer, fulfilling the mythical narrative\nof the mentor-disciple dyad.182 This narrative structure echoes the \nprocess of perekovka at the White Sea-Baltic Canal. A newly arrived, often \nuntrained, prisoner might refuse to work or participate, setting up the \ntask.183 The vospitatel’ acts as the mentor, guiding the prisoner along the \npath of reformation. While there may be initial setbacks, eventually a \nsymbolic initiation occurs. Remarkably, this kind of narrative forms the \nkey structure of most Belomor autobiographies even though these texts \nwere written mainly in the summer of 1933, a full year before the formal \ndeclaration of socialist realism as official literary method at the August \n1934 First All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers. In addition, prisoners \ncomposed these works in the relative isolation of a labor camp; although \nmany had access to libraries and newspapers, the prison environment as \nwell as Karelia’s remote location necessarily restricted cultural life.\nThe stress on the life story in prisoner works about the canal also has \na direct parallel with the biographical pattern evident in socialist realism\nafter 1932.184 The prevalence of the biographical mode stems in part \nfrom the importance of the “positive hero” as one of the most recognizable\nfeatures of socialist realism.185 The positive hero, emblematic of \nBolshevik ideals, is often so generic and featureless that he appears not \nas an individual but more as hagiography.186 Such is also the case with \nthe re-forged prisoner: newly devoted and dramatically transformed, he \nis no longer discernible from the other convicts around him. Continuing \nthe religious motif, the re-forging narratives are ritualized and repetitive,\nand they become conversion narratives. These texts subsequently \nrepresent liturgy. Other criminals can read of the transformations and \nunderstand the model they are supposed to follow in their voyage from \ndarkness to light, from uninitiated to initiated. Prisoners perform selfhood\nthrough the narrative act in an attempt to assure their survival, \nand through this performance Soviet propaganda is internalized while \nmost evidence of individuality is dissolved. Paradoxically, however, in \norder to re-fashion themselves, prisoners must first narrate the specific \ndetails of their past lives in their autobiographies.187 \nThe short story “Karas’,” by the prisoner A. K. Ivanov, is a productive \nexample of a conversion narrative; although it is not written as an autobiographical\nsubmission, it follows the same pattern of a re-forging tale \nand addresses important aspects of identity formation. The title itself, \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 59 —\nwhich means a “wide-hipped woman” in criminal slang,188 is a klichka \n(nickname) for the main character and represents his position within the \ncriminal world (i.e., feminized and subservient). Significantly, the prisoner\nwho submitted the story first wrote it in the third person, saying \n“he” (on) did this or that, but subsequently changed the third-person to \nfirst-person (ia), crossing out the previous pronouns in what was perhaps \nan attempt to render the story more realistic and personal. Similarly, \nwhile the story is signed by A. K. Ivanov, the name “Karas’” is scribbled \nmore hastily next to his own real name, most likely another last-minute \neffort to make the story appear to be an autobiography. \nThis story has many of the characteristic features of the re-forging \nnarrative. Most important is the role played by the vospitatel’ (educator), \nwho is likened to a father figure: “I listened attentively to the educator’s \nspeech. It seemed to me as if the educator was speaking to me like my \nfather who was killed in the war.”189 While the physical speech of the \nreformer-educator frequently represents the first stage in the transformation,190\nthe second could come at night, during sleep or dreams, when \nthe ideas spoken of earlier have the opportunity to coalesce and take \nhold.191 Some prisoners also imagine the dreams of their loved ones at \nhome; in his diary, one prisoner pictures his wife Olia dreaming about \nher drunken, wild husband with a knife in his hands, and he tries to assure\nher that this really is just a dream—he is no longer a murderous ma-\nniac but is reading books and sitting in a Lenin Corner.192 Dreams here \nare a schematic re-interpretation of the past, a way of acknowledging \nmemories before transcending them.193 Dreams also have a very specific \nfunction in the Russian criminal world, where they are believed to have \nthe ability to forecast the future. Thieves, therefore, have a special respect\nfor dreams and their content.194 \nKaras’ could not fall asleep the night after a conversation with the \nvospitatel’, and he reviews his life history, in particular his difficult familial\nsituation: “My thoughts sped away far into the past, remembering my \nfather who did not return from the war. They killed him. I was seven years \nold. Finding out about the death of my father, my mother cried loudly. \nShe also died in 1917.”195 Like so many other prisoners at Belomor, Karas’ \nis an orphan and finds a substitute family in his re-educator and in the \nethos of the state. The fact that so many of the prisoners were orphans \nwho came from broken homes could explain their willingness to conform \nto ideological principles in order to garner the safety and protection of \n', '— 60 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nthe regime as a substitute for their non-existent home lives. Karas’ wakes \nup the day after his prophetic dream and decides to begin working. In \nthe symbolic finale of the story, the character loses his old nickname of \n“Karas’,” and now everyone calls him by his full name, Aleksei Ivanovich \n(very similar to the prisoner’s real name of A. K. Ivanov), in recognition \nof his newfound appreciation for a dignified, laboring lifestyle.196 Just as \ngaining a criminal nickname is an essential aspect of entering the thieves’ \nworld,197 so would dropping it be a highly symbolic gesture of complete \ndisavowal of lawless ways. \nThe prisoner Mikhail Koldobenko ends his autobiographical submission\nwith a statement in all capitals, claiming this is “how the steel \nwas tempered”198 before signing his name. Such a pronouncement immediately\nbrings to mind the identically-titled socialist-realist classic \nby Nikolai Ostrovskii, How the Steel Was Tempered (Kak zakalialas’ stal’, \n1932-1934), which—significantly—was published as a model socialist \nrealist work only after Koldobenko wrote his autobiography, confirming \nhow texts produced at the White Sea-Baltic Canal can prefigure what \nemerged outside the zona. In another parallel with a socialist-realist classic,\nthe prisoner Fillipp Kabanenko (who interestingly refers to himself \nas “comrade” rather than “canal-army soldier,” the officially accepted \nterm at the camp199) recalls how he injured both his legs at the work site \nand had to be carried by his brigade, and despite not healing well insisted \non continuing to work with his bandaged legs.200 This autobiographical \ndetail echoes Boris Polevoi’s socialist-realist novel Story about a Real Man \n(Povest’ o nastoiashchem cheloveke, 1946), which concerns the plight of \na Soviet pilot who, despite losing both his legs, still flies in service to \nhis country. Such examples confirm the compatibility between penal \nreeducation and the socialist realist master narrative and have important\nimplications for the Soviet ideological system. Given that the prison \nprogram echoes the state-approved form of literature, it becomes easier \nto align the realms inside and outside of the zona. In addition, such correspondences\nbetween prison writings and the socialist realist narrative \nindicate that the master plot is rooted in Bolshevik ideology—and perhaps\nin even earlier cultural norms—rather than being spontaneously \ninvented. \nThe presence of master plot elements in these criminal narratives \ndemonstrates two central thematic undercurrents: the state as substitute\nfamily, and the process of perekovka as a ritualistic, religious phe-\n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 61 —\nnomenon. Interestingly, many of the nuances of these characteristics \nalso hold true for the put’ of perekovka in the reverse direction: the fall \ninto the criminal world, where the figure of a thieving mentor appears \nmore vivid and durable.\nThe Inverse Trajectory of Perekovka\nThe words doroga and put’ can both be translated as road or pathway in \nRussian, but the difference between the two terms is significant. While \ndoroga implies simple back-and-forth movement, the perfunctory practicality\nof the path, put’ implies an end result, a final destination that will \nbe better than the point of departure. As Emma Widdis notes within the \ncontext of Soviet film, put’ “was reconfigured not as progression to an \nelusive but significant goal but as the dynamic process of transformation\nitself.”201 Put’ becomes equivalent to perekovka. Yet what could be \ncalled the inverse of perekovka—the fall into the criminal world—is also \noften reached by what the criminals call a put’, which must necessarily \ncomplicate not only how we view the prisoners’ supposed transformations,\nbut also our understanding of how their narratives were read by \nthe authorities. \nThe prisoner autobiography by Grigorii Koshelev, entitled “My Path” \n(Moi put’), demonstrates colorfully how the road to crime can mirror the \nroad to socialist labor. As is very common, familial problems serve as the \ngenerator of a life of crime for Koshelev: his father went to war in 1914 \nand his mother subsequently died of hunger, leaving him to search the \nstreets, dirty and cold, for nourishment.202 He soon met and befriended \nVas’ka-Svistun (“Vaska the Whistler,” or, in slang, “Vaska the Liar”), a \nvodka-drinking criminal, and asked him how he was able to procure so \nmuch food and drink. Enamored of Vas’ka’s criminal lifestyle and the \nluxuries it affords, he “decides to start upon this path” himself.203 It is \nsignificant here that the author uses the same—and very loaded—term \nin Russian for the pathway that brings him to a life of crime as for the one \nthat brings him to a life of honest labor: put’. It is possible, in turn, to see \nVas’ka-Svistun as a sort of inverse vospitatel’, a teacher or reformer who \neducates him about a life of stealing rather than about a life of labor, and \nalso changes his world and habits. \nKoshelev traveled from city to city, picking up supplementary nicknames\nand additional jail time along the way. While he at first followed \n', '— 62 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nVas’ka-Svistun like a devoted protégé, Koshelev eventually lost track of \nhim. In 1929, he was sent to Solovki, where he still refused to give up his \nold ways and still dreamed of his former friend and father figure: “The \nwhole time traveling in the train I was playing cards and thinking about \nthe past, drunken, merry days, about Vas’ka Svistun, dreaming about \nsomehow running away and meeting with Vas’ka once again to start \nthieving.”204 Then, the unexpected happened—one day Koshelev met his \npal Vas’ka on the camp site but barely recognized him; Vas’ka was now the \nhead of a shock-worker brigade, literate and cultured. Although Vas’ka \ncontinually tried to convince his friend to change to a working lifestyle, \nKoshelev did not want to hear about it, and he eventually began avoiding \nhis former partner-in-crime. Vas’ka may have served as his vospitatel’ for \nthe criminal world, but he did not play this role in Koshelev’s reverse \ntrajectory—it was not a reformer who eventually convinced Koshelev to \nadopt a life of labor, but rather the peer pressure of his fellow prisoners:\nAnd so there was a despicable attitude against me. In the \nkitchen they opened the windows and hung loafers, they \nstarted to write my name on the black board of shame \nand in the wall newspapers, spreading it throughout the \nentire camp, through the radio and paper that I am a \nloafer, an idler, wherever I went everyone began laughing \nand making fun of me. I was alone in the company and \nevery day the educator (vospitatel’) Zarybaev led discussions,\ntalking about the free, Soviet country and how it \nwas impossible not to work living in the USSR.205 \nThis recollection is particularly revealing, because it suggests how \nmassive the panopticon of propaganda was at the White Sea-Baltic Canal. \nIn anticipation of what was to occur in the country as a whole, nearly \nevery surface of the camp site was used as a place to disseminate slogans \nand ideological propaganda. Exhibits at the canal’s construction were \ndecorated with flags and banners, included notices and orders, and even \nshowcased different kinds of Karelian rock. Yet although the vospitatel’ \nand visual propaganda were omnipresent, shame and perennial teasing \nseemed to be the method of choice—one that was truly successful—in \nconvincing recalcitrant prisoners to begin working. \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 63 —\nIn a sketch submitted to the Perekovka newspaper, the prisoner G. \nMel’nikov included work complaints as well as a more detailed description\nof the prisoners’ work ethic. He understood the importance of \nworker collectivity in the context of the infiltration of two loafers named \nRus and Mailov. After the two were subjected to a week of taunting by \nthe rest of the work collective, they finally decided to start working. \nThis was precisely the kind of psychological atmosphere the authorities \nwanted to create; a den of peer pressure where fellow prisoners began \nacting more like administrators than convicts, because they knew the \ngroup’s collective work output depended upon the work completed by \neach individual member. So the “patience” (terpenie) of Mel’nikov’s \nbrigade finally gives out, and they show Rus and Mailov how to work, \nan effort that was couched in pedagogical terms: they decide “to teach” \n(pouchit’) those who were not producing, and their “studies” (ucheba) \nbegan the moment they arrived in the work brigade. This pedagogical \nFigure 8. A smattering of visual propaganda at the canal’s construction, including announcements of \nthe best workers, collections of local types of rock, administrative orders, and slogans. Photograph \nreproduced with permission of Iurii Dmitriev.\n', '— 64 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nterminology echoes the efforts of the vospitateli at Belomor, who saw \ntheir task of re-forging as an educational process. 206 \nWhile the prisoner Koshelev does eventually begin working and reading\nnewspapers, becoming literate, he claims merely that he “got used to \nthe educator” (ia privyk k vospitateliu) and not that he was truly swayed \nby him. When he sees Vas’ka again, the former criminal is being freed \nearly as one of the best shock-workers; Vas’ka later writes his friend \nthat he is now working on the Moscow-Kurskii railroad line as a conductor.\nVas’ka, therefore, exchanged his metaphorical put’ for a literal one, \nleaving behind the pathway of crime to follow the more entrenched, \nstraight path of the railroad tracks.207 Koshelev ends his autobiography \nby thanking his comrades for putting him on the proper put’, one that \nno longer follows crime but instead a life of work. \nLike Koshelev, the prisoner Orest Vziaemskii falls under the influence\nof a criminal-world educator, Semen, and Vziaemskii highlights \nthe allure inherent in a life of crime in his description of Semen:\nI have to say the people who are used to a more refined \nlife of the mind are worse off in terms of their personal \nqualities than people who are closer to life, who address \ndanger as a trade. Maybe to blame them is not possible, \nbecause for them, as Semen said, life seems vapid if they \nare not exposed to danger. I advised him to become a \npilot, or that he should understand the construction’s \nfervor. He finished a ton of courses, he was a tractor \ndriver, he was in Pioneer camp, but he always returned \nto the dangerous life. He remains one of the brightest of \nall my memories.208\nSemen, unlike Vas’ka, cannot be re-forged even though he might try \nto re-educate himself. Almost like a drug user, he is addicted to a life \nof crime, and Vziaemskii is entranced by his colorful life more than he \ncould be by any vospitatel’ preaching about socialist labor.\nThe autobiography of the prisoner Mikhail Koldobenko is another \nre-forging tale that concentrates more on the pathway to the criminal \nworld than on the road to socialism, its narrative offering a telling \nglimpse into the psychology of crime. Born in 1901, Koldobenko has \nmemories of growing up with his drunk father whose life advice (in ad-\n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 65 —\ndition to quitting school) consisted of: “You struggle really hard—like \nfish beating against the ice—but still you have nothing to eat. And they \nsuck your blood like spiders.”209 Koldobenko began working at the age of \nsixteen in a factory, and when World War I broke out he started to feel \nlike a real man; he got married, he was not afraid of death, and he loved \nto work. With the sudden death of his wife in childbirth, however, his \nlife fell apart: “right away life snapped […] and so stretched on the boring,\ngray days.”210 He saw death everywhere and was solely responsible \nfor his young daughter. Eventually, he took to drink. When he married \nagain, his second wife turned out to be a “meshchanka” (a member of \nthe petty bourgeoisie, or someone of narrow tastes and interests) who \ndid not like to work and had a fondness for sweets. When she suggested \nto him that they could wound the child with a needle in the top of the \nhead, causing her to die without anyone noticing, he decided to leave \nher, but his life only became more difficult.\nWhile examples have already made evident the psychological thrill \nprovided by a life of crime, Koldobenko’s road to prison was related directly\nto alcohol. At the camp site, he claimed to be captured by the idea \nof physical work, which was the best way for him to address his drunkenness,\n“Prison is a good school for drunkards. It turns them towards a \nnew life […] I regret only one thing: that I landed late in prison, thank \nyou Soviet power for returning me to life. Thank you to the camps of the \nOGPU for its humanitarian approach to criminals.”211 In this surprising \naffirmation of allegiance, Koldobenko reinforces the notion of perekovka \nas a successful way to refashion prisoners and also frames his transformation\nin pedagogical terms. In these inverse trajectories of perekovka, \nthe role of guide or mentor and the notion of pathway remain essential \nelements. Narratives in which a criminal mentor plays an essential role \nseem to downplay the role of the official vospitatel’, with peer pressure \nfrom other prisoners emerging as a more convincing call to labor. While \nsuch a move may not have been a conscious effort on the part of the \ncriminals, the fact that a different kind of perekovka emerges in the face \nof the absence of the socialist version is significant. Already having had \ntheir lives once transformed, the prisoners could have related easily to \nthe perekovka concept and so been able to easily pen the trajectory of \ntransformation, no matter in what direction.\n', '— 66 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nViolating the Norm: \nSubversive Criminal Narratives\nAlthough most of these criminal autobiographies follow the formula of \nan initial stage of laziness, a second stage of contemplation (whether \nthrough the vospitatel’, reflection on earlier life, prophetic dreams, or \nintimidation by fellow prisoners), and a final stage of abandoning the \npast and becoming a productive worker, there are also narratives that \nviolate this pattern to varying degrees. There are prisoner autobiographies\nin which there is no admission of guilt and no particular praise of \nthe Soviet system. Begin a new sentence: Although such examples are \nrare, the mere presence of such texts indicates a lack of strict censorship—not\nonly were less-than-positive tales kept (and left unmarked) \nby the administration, the prisoners themselves clearly felt comfortable \nwith penning submissions that paint the canal experience in an unfavorable\nlight. \nOne such example is the autobiography of Mikhail Polokhin, a \ncriminal who practiced the seasonal work of stealing motorcycles and \nbicycles for three years before switching to thieving on railroad cars. \nPolokhin seems to take pride in his criminal life; he describes his various\nextra-legal professions with flair, explaining precisely the details \nof his criminal maneuverings. He had the nickname “Tashkent,” and \nhe moved to various cities before finally being caught stealing a large \nsum of money and sent to Povenets, where part of the Belomor construction\nwas located. Included in his narrative was no allegiance to \nthe Soviet state, and no description of re-forging, but instead only his \nsuccess in securing false documents. With these documents, he went \ninto the city of Povenets every day instead of working at the camp \nsite and continued his former vocation of stealing from suitcases. \nHe asserts that he lacked nothing in prison and was well fed. In an \nunorthodox description of the administrative organization, he claims \nthe authorities are often entirely unapprised of the activities at the \nwork site: \nThe monitor and company apparently did not know who \nand how many people they had, and where to find these \npeople. They are either sleeping or working. In short, \nan extremely advantageous situation was created for \nloafers and pretenders. The loafers went wherever they \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 67 —\npleased, especially those who were the smartest. But it \nwasn’t even necessary to be particularly smart. And so I \nhung around for more than a month, but in the end I got \nsick of the idle life.212 \nIt was utter boredom—and not a shock-worker mentality or allegiance\nto the Soviet state—that ultimately pushed Polokhin to form a \nwork collective called “The Pathway to Socialism” (Put’ k sotsializmu), a \nname that seems incongruous with Polokhin’s laziness and distaste for \nwork. Despite Polokhin’s indifferent attitude, the all-important component\nof pathway remains, demonstrating how essential this element \nwas in cultural narratives regarding the canal. In both utopian texts and \ntravel narratives (including those of religious pilgrimage), the trope of \nthe road is a vital element; in order to describe a fantastical, alternate \nreality or a literal one, one must explain how to arrive there. Even biographies\nthat seem to violate the norm, therefore, still contain important \nideological motifs central to the canal’s construction. \nRather than suffering from mere disinterest or boredom, other \nprisoners criticize the regime for its lack of fairness. Iosima Korneevich \nZhitkov claims that he received fewer privileges than his friend, who \nhad worked less than he did. He goes on to assert that the recent atmosphere\non the canal was negative because the Party was not strong \nenough. Cryptically, he says, “But that is all I can write,” giving the \nreader a sense that there is more criticism he would like to air, but he \nis simply not free to.213 The unexplained ellipses that appear in his text \nalso allude to this possibility. Yet despite these criticisms, the prisoner \ndoes not demonstrate any clear anti-Soviet tendencies, instead writing \nof his desire for better Party organization.\nAlthough they are not as long or descriptive as Polokhin’s text, \nthere are other prisoner autobiographies that also refute the supposed \ntransformational potential of perekovka. The prisoner Fedor Tupikov \ndeclares in his text that he is not guilty and has never committed any \ncrime. Although he claims he learned many things in prison, including \nhow to read, he swears no allegiance to the Belomor project. There is no \nmention of udarnichestvo, although he does write that he would like to \nbecome part of the workers’ family.214 While not necessarily declaring \ntheir innocence, other prisoners use their autobiographies to point out \nshortcomings on the canal: “dampness in the barracks, the wind blowing \n', '— 68 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nthrough cracks, even no place to dry your foot wrappings on occasion,” \nand only since they were young and their “blood is boiling” could they \nwithstand such conditions.215 The initial paucity of the cultural environment\nalso becomes apparent, even if the situation improved as the canal \nwas constructed:\nAll of this work went on in very difficult conditions, \nthere was no cultural life and not even any promises of \nit. The club corner was just beginning to be built [….] So \nI started to go to the [reading] corner, where they had \nsome books, magazines, newspapers. I was especially \ninterested in questions concerning the international \nsituation, because in our division and camp there were \ngossips, and an out-and-out counter-revolution spread \naround rumors that Japan had taken the Baikal and \nnow there is supposedly some secret council or congress \nthat is discussing something. I looked upon all this with \nsuspicion, and I wanted to report it, but I didn’t see any \npower to whom to report; despite the fact that I’m in \nthe camps of the OGPU, at our work point the KVCh216 \nworked weakly.217\nThis passage illuminates several different aspects of life at Belomor, \nincluding hardship, gossip, and the attempt to self-aggrandize, most \nlikely in the interest of protecting oneself politically. The passage’s \nauthor, Abram Bessonov,218 seems unabashed in his criticism of cultural\nlife at the canal; in his opinion, although it did exist, it was not \nas productive or as thorough as other prisoners may make it out to \nseem. In addition, Bessonov acknowledges the existence of gossip and \nwhisperers at the labor camp,219 as well as the ideological and moral \npressure to report those who do not fall into line, even when no one is \nlooking or paying attention. His narrative is quite contradictory—he is \nat once interested in international news and gossip and trying to refute \nit. The end to his story, nevertheless, is a “happy” one—he himself becomes\na vospitatel’ and publishes wall newspapers. Although Tupikov \nand Bessonov both offer criticism of the Soviet regime, they would \nlike to become members of its utopian reality. Such criticisms were not \novertly publicized, but the mere fact that the prisoners felt comfortable \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 69 —\nwriting in such a manner attests to the relative softness of the regime \nin comparison to later Gulag camps. \nBeyond the existence of such potentially subversive texts, the existence\nof RUR (rota usilennogo rezhima), a type of special punishment \nzone in which recalcitrant prisoners were housed, made it evident that \nnot all prisoners were willing to work or to accept the message of reforging.\nMost of these prisoners flatly refused to work in any capacity, \nand they were a significant number: one memoir estimates about 750 \npeople in the “stable” (koniushnia) section of RUR, which represented \nonly one barrack.220 These intractable prisoners were frightening even to \nother hardened criminals, who noted their savage cruelty. Since the inhabitants\nof RUR were not working, their food ration was much smaller, \nand the prisoners would steal and fight for one another’s portions, often \nkilling or maiming one another.221 \nIn her autobiography, the shock-worker Elena Il’inichna recalled \nfewer prisoners in RUR—286, to be exact—and claims that the pakhan \n(crime-boss) played an important role in discouraging the prisoners \nfrom working. Her role as an educator-reformer was to convince the \nprisoners to begin participating in the canal’s construction. When they \nasked for bread, she gave them bread. Once they had bread, they asked \nher for tobacco.222 Supposedly, Elena’s reading of an official order out \nloud to the RUR inhabitants inspired them to finally begin working, \ndespite their recalcitrance.223 In addition to the presence of RUR, the \nneed for periodic chistki (purges) of the work collectives demonstrates \nthe presence and threat of unruly prisoners, even within the supposedly \nlaw-abiding organizations of labor brigades.224 \nGiven the presence of subversive texts, institutions like RUR, and \nthe necessity of cleaning the ranks of the brigades, it is easy to doubt the \nsuccesses of re-forging. It would be impossible to calculate its actual effect\non recidivism, just as it is not possible to ascertain what the prison-\ners truly thought about the rehabilitative program. In Nikolai Pogodin’s \nBelomor play Aristocrats (Aristokraty), the character Sonia’s re-forging is \npreceded by heavy amounts of doubt and skepticism: “It’s all a lie [.…] \nIt’s a lie! Re-forging, remaking, education, newspapers [.…] Who are \nthey fooling? A prison’s a prison!”225 Yet as the genre demands, Sonia is \nre-forged and her educator-reformer is re-cast in the role of metaphorical\nfather. Knowing Sonia is an orphan, the vospitatel’ asks about her \nfamily situation and then compares himself to a paternal figure in an \n', '— 70 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\nattempt to serve as a substitute father. Such familial recasting likely had \na distinct appeal for criminal prisoners, many of whom were orphaned \nor abandoned.  \nThe Re-forging of Homeless Children\nThe notion of perekovka—in the form of the New Man—has other \nimportant parallels in Soviet culture. One of the most relevant is the \nphenomenon of besprizorniki, or homeless orphans, in Russia. Not surprisingly,\nchildren were at the forefront of the campaign to indoctrinate \nindividuals with socialist ideology. In many strictly controlled regimes, \nit is common to begin with the youth—their consciousness is not yet \nfully formed and so represents a tabula rasa for ideology.226 Gorky promoted\nthis point of view at the First Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934, \nacknowledging children’s literature as “the most important ‘front’ of \nsocialist creative labor and a natural ground for creating the ‘new Soviet \nman.’”227 In terms of Soviet literature of the time period, one needs \nto think only of the slogan-chirping Nastia in Andrei Platonov’s The \nFoundation Pit (Kotlovan, 1930)228 or the strapping soccer player Volodia \nin Iurii Olesha’s Envy (Zavist’, 1927) to see just how easily younger \nmembers of society can become thoughtless ideological containers. \nThe topic of the New Man was essential to children’s literature of the \nlate 1920s and early 1930s, since “children’s writers were expected to \nproduce books that reflected the new Soviet values.”229 The school tale \nnot only included key aspects of socialist realism but also served as a \npedagogical version of the perekovka narrative.230 Children’s literature \noften contained industrial themes that linked visual and textual images \nin homage to the Russian avant-garde, just as it was also, in a paradoxical\nmove, being streamlined and institutionalized along Party lines.231 \nThis transitional period in children’s literature reflects the nature of \nthe artwork produced at the White Sea-Baltic Canal adeptly, since texts \nproduced by the project exhibit artistic hybridity.\nWith the evolving role of children’s literature also came a new interpretation\nof childhood. Spearheaded by none other than Gorky himself, \nthe interpretation turned childhood into an “anti-utopia,” a space of \nsuffering and sadness, as is the case with the author’s own childhood \nmemoir, which mostly documents his harsh treatment by neighbors \nand relatives. The idea of a happy childhood was seen as anti-socialist \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 71 —\nand bourgeois, an outdated notion linked to the gentry class. Instead, \nSoviet authors chose to portray one’s upbringing as lonely and difficult, \nwith separation and alienation from parental figures.232 These unhappy \nchildren characters, who use their sorrow and displacement as sources \nof strength and vitality,233 are not so different from the criminals and \nthieves at the White Sea-Baltic Canal; they come from broken homes, \nhave certainly had unfortunate childhoods filled with hunger and want, \nand use their troubled pasts as springboards to begin new futures.234 The \ncriminals at the White Sea-Baltic Canal were very often parentless, or if \nthey still had a parent alive they were estranged from them because of \ntheir unlawful lifestyles. Both groups, the young orphans and the abandoned\ncriminals, were ideal targets for perekovka, because they had no \nfamily structure on which to rely. The Soviet Union could easily become \ntheir ancestral replacement. Mikhail Nikolaev, orphaned in 1932 at the \nage of three, recalled: \nAfter all, we were deprived of family events, of conversations\naround the kitchen table—that non-official, and, \nin my opinion, most important source of information \nthat forms man’s notions of life and his relationship with \nthe world. Our “window on the world” was the teachers, \nthe educators, the camp councilors, the radio in the red \ncorner, and the newspaper The Pioneers’ Truth.235 \nNot only were both groups a blank slate for Soviet ideology, but the \ntwo were strategically targeted for reformation, since both wayward orphans\nand professional criminals represented a threat to the well-being \nof Soviet society at large.236 \nAnton Makarenko’s pedagogical classic, The Road to Life \n(Pedagogicheskaia poema, 1935), tells the story of the appropriatelynamed\nGorky colony for young delinquents, where orphans were taken \nin and “reformed” through education and hard work. The Belomor official \nSemen Moiseev makes a connection between Belomor and the juvenile \neducation program, writing that the prisoners were taught “according to \nMakarenko’s methods” (po metodam A. S. Makarenko).237 Once again, the \ntheme of the New Man comes to the fore, since one of the key goals at \nthe colony centered upon the fact that “we have to find new methods for \nthe creation of the new man.”238 Here the parallels with the Gulag prison \n', '— 72 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\ncamp are even more striking, since the orphanage is likened to a den \nof thieves, where crime and hooliganism run rampant.239 The old forms \nof instruction—such as the rod in Tsarist Russia—are compared to the \nprogressive education of the present day, just as official works about the \nWhite Sea-Baltic Canal contrast Soviet incarceration with its capitalist \ncounterpart.240 The importance of strict, military-type training at the \nGorky colony for juvenile delinquents241 parallels the militaristic jargon \nused in many Belomor texts.\nAs was the case with the convicts on the canal, it is supposedly a \nnew life of construction and physical work that allows the children to \nchange their lives and habits.242 By extension, while rebuilding outhouses\nor clearing paths in the forest, they understand these physical \nactions metaphorically and see them as analogies for their rebuilt lives. \nThe orphan-thieves of the Gorky colony admired the namesake of the \ninstitution because they could identify with his life and see it as not so \ndifferent from their own. They idealize his rough-and-tumble biography \nas well as the romantic portrayals of thieves and criminals in his early \nshort stories and plays. Once again Gorky seems to have become a symbolic\npersona for the era and its various hopes and struggles. The boys \nare reported to have reacted positively to Makarenko’s explication of \nGorky’s life: \nAt first they didn’t believe me when I told them the real \nstory of Maxim Gorky’s own life. They were stunned \nby the story, suddenly struck by the idea: “So Gorky \nwas like us! I say, that’s fine!” This idea moved them \nprofoundly and joyfully. Maxim Gorky’s life seemed to \nbecome part of our life. Various episodes in it provided \nus with examples for comparison, a fund of nicknames, a \nbackground for debate, and a scale for the measurement \nof human values.243\nIt is significant that specifically Gorky’s life story inspired the boys, \nsince autobiography played an essential, motivational role in the reforging\nof prisoners at the White Sea-Baltic Canal. Not only did Gorky \nchampion the notion of perekovka, but his lived experience can act as an \nexample of the phenomenon. His story inspires others, just as at Belomor \nthe tale of one criminal’s re-forging is intended to instigate it in another. \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 73 —\nThe Gorky colony gave many of the juvenile delinquents a new lease \non life, offering them opportunities and support networks. However, \nsome students left without being “reformed,” or were forced to depart \nbecause of mischievous behavior. Although the transformative process \nat the orphanage was similar to perekovka, there were also key differences.\nOne important difference is that the charges living at the colony were \nnot prisoners and could technically leave of their own free will, according\nto Makarenko’s text. More importantly, there was a decided lack of \nemphatically ideological instruction in their re-education, a component \nthat was absolutely imperative in the re-forging of White Sea-Baltic \nCanal prisoners. Even when the boys living at the colony expressed interest\nin becoming members of Komsomol, the youth communist club, \nthis path was initially forbidden to them, as Party members saw them as \ndelinquents and ineligible for consideration. Only after their departure \nfrom the colony and their certifiable reformation could the topic of their \ninclusion in the organisation be discussed.244 This is precisely the opposite\nof the situation at the White Sea-Baltic Canal, where the prisoners \nwere encouraged from the very beginning to be trained ideologically, \nto understand Soviet mannerisms, speech, and traditions. Officials believed\nthat the more a previously debased convict could take pride in his \nnewly upstanding socialist status, the more likely he or she was to be \ntransformed completely and permanently.245 \nIn certain cases, juvenile delinquency and incarceration as reformation\nfollowed parallel tracks. The OGPU, which was in charge of operating \nthe Gulag, also headed children’s colonies to garner favorable publicity. \nIn 1929, the OGPU sent juvenile delinquents to the Solovki prison camp \nin an attempt to quell rumors about the abominable conditions in the \nGulag; such problem children were also sent to the White Sea-Baltic Canal. \nIn addition, just as the canal administration ultimately viewed Belomor \nprisoners as wares processed by the “factory of life,” so did Makarenko \ninterpret unruly children as products in his pedagogical writings: “Every \nperson reformed by us is a product of our pedagogical production. Both \nwe and society must examine our product very intently and carefully, \nto the last tiny detail.”246 Although the homeless children problem had \ndiminished somewhat by the mid-1920s, juvenile criminality soared \nin 1929 during the brutal process of collectivization.247 Since most of \nthe prisoners at the White Sea-Baltic Canal were peasants incarcerated \nfor being kulaks, it is the State itself that created the massive homeless \n', '— 74 —\n——————————————————— Chapter One ———————————————————\npopulation. In an ironic twist of fate, the two groups—the homeless, basically\norphaned children and their convict parents—were subject to the \nsame propaganda of re-education and re-forging in the name of Soviet \npower. These families, broken apart by the very institutions attempting \nto indoctrinate them, were now supposed to look to the state itself as a \nreplacement for their family, which may at some point have been intact. \nYet many prisoners did not make this connection, instead blaming the \n“vile” elements of capitalism in the Russian Civil War for the deaths of \ntheir parents, which had left them homeless and set them upon the path \nof criminal behavior.248 Similar to the paradox of prisoners being forged \nas free beings by the very labor that imprisons them, the predicament \nof homeless children demonstrates an additional contradiction. Both \nre-educational programs are totalizing and complete: there can be no \nalternative to the Soviet path.\nConclusion: Navigating Soviet Reality\nWhile the relationship between put’ and perekovka demonstrates the \nironic parallels between a fall into a life of crime and a lift into a socialist \nreality, certain incompatibilities remain. The role of the criminal mentor\nis often more pronounced and durable than that of the vospitatel’ \ncounterpart, who is not necessarily always responsible for a criminal’s \nre-forging. Often the peer pressure of other prisoners working in the \nbrigade, or the allure of specific incentives (like a shortened prison \nterm), is more successful than the typical educator’s speech. There are \nalso inconsistencies on schematic, symbolic planes. In what is a ritualistic,\nrepetitive act, elements of the personal and individual become \nmagnified; in what is an atheist country, quasi-religious conversion narratives\nare promoted; in what is a forced-labor Gulag camp, lax policies \nand disobedience abound and often remain unnoticed. \nIn the face of these divergent characteristics, one unifying thread \nremains: the put’, or path, of transformation. The names alone of various \nwork brigades at the canal make this evident: “The Path to Correction” \n(Put’ k ispravleniiu), “The Path to Studies” (Put’ k uchebe), “The Path to \nSocialism” (Put’ k sotsializmu), and so on. Perekovka, like its inverse voyage\ntowards the criminal world, was figured spatially and linked with a \nsense of physical motion toward a defined goal, rendering the phenomenon\na type of pilgrimage. While there may be a defined set of features \n', '—————————————————— The Factory of Life ——————————————————\n \n— 75 —\naccompanying a pilgrimage, each pilgrim participates in the voyage in \nan individualized way,249 similar to how criminals performed perekovka \nat Belomor. Similarly, the writers’ brigade completed a pilgrimage to the \nbaptismal waters of the White Sea-Baltic Canal in order to pen their collectively\nwritten tome about the project. In the factory of life, the physi-\ncality of creation becomes apparent, and art and labor are inextricably \nbound in performing the cycle of alternating production and destruction.\n']</pre>
