This\nbill, which adds about 60 to the\nnumber of engineer officers, also au\nthorizes the President to place the\narmy engineers in full charge of all\npublic works.\nBut the far-seeing insurgents im\nmediately detected an effort to pro\nvide an easy way for Ballinger to\nget rid of Director Newell and Chief\nEngineer Davis, of the Reclamation\nservice, as it had been quietly hinted\nthat one of the first uses that would\nbe made of the law would be to\nplace army engineers in charge of\nthe Reclamation service, and there\nby permit Ballinger to wreack per\nsonal vengeance upon Newell and\nDavis for daring to publicly proclaim\nthat his conduct was antagonistic to\nthe public interest.\nSenator Bailey of Texas is the\nleader in the fight against the bill,\nalthough he is actuated by personal\nmotives.

A man re\nsembling Charlton was arrested as\nhe stepped from the steamer at Ik*\npier in Hoboken. He gave the names\nof Charles W.

The Dem\nocratic state convention, which com\npleted its labors Wednesday at Day\nton, endorsed him in the strongest\nterms for the Presidency of the\nUnited State after it had renominat\ned him for governor by acclamation.\nThe belief held by many delegate.*\nthat the governor will resign short\nly after the beginning of his new\nterm in order to become a candidate\nfor President before the next Demo\ncratic national convention was voic\ned ,by former Governor James A.\nCampbell. The ex-governor was in\ntroducing Altee Pomerene, of Canton,\nthe nominee for lieutenant governor.\n"Here is the man," he said, "who\nwill be lieutenant governor, for six\nmonths and the governor for a year\nand six months. Both of these fabu\nlous promotions, however, were ac\ncomplished against the earnest pro\ntest of their beneficiaries."\nThe following resolution was pre\nsented by the committee on resolu\ntions by the convention endorsing\nGovernor Harmon for the Presidency\nin 1912:\n"We invite the attention of "the\nnation to Judson Harmon and the\nwork he is doing for Ohio. Two years\nhense it will have been completed,\nthen we can spare him for larger\nduties.

Firmness and\nstrength mark hira the man to sup\nplant vacillation and weakness.

He was told that it cculd not\nbe prevented.\nAtlee Pomerene, who was him\nself a candidate against Harmon for\nthe nomination in the state conven\ntion two years, ago, almost angrily\ndemanded that .he be not compel.ed\nto make the sacrifice, as he termed\nit, ot acepting the nomination for\'\nsecond place. Although his name\nwas not placed in nomination, he re\nceived nearly enough votes on th-i\nfirst ballot to nominate. He form\nally withdrew, but on the second\nballot, before the roll call was com\npli ted, the nomination was made\nunanimous. He asked time to con\nsider the matter and after an hour s.\nconference with his frienls announc\ned .he would accept. . .. , I\nThe proposition to endorse a can-j\ndidate for United States senator that\nwas suggested by William J.

The Man\nning Times says "the letter of Zacn\nMcGhee in Sunday\'s State is so far\nat varience with these of other cor\nrespondents about the Roosevelt re\nception, that, we .think Zach must\nhave taken a slumber in Pitt street\namong the celestials. He is the on!y\nco:tespondent that, fails to find en\nthusiasm for Kcosevelt on his ar\nrival home from Elba, and his at\ntempts to make small of what must\nhave been one of the most remark\nable demonstrations ever accorded\na private citizen, that his readers\nnrust wonder what ails The State s\nWashington scribe."\nThe Times then goes on to say\nthat "the home-coming of Col.\nRoosevelt was in keeping with the\nreceptions aoocrded this American\nelsewhere in the world, and regard\nless of party affiliations it was mete\nand proper for a united welcome\nto a distinguished American whose\nutterances abroad wherever he spoke\nbreathed true America cisrn, and\nfound a favorable response in every\nAmerican breast. Therefore, when\na little space-fillr sends in such rot\nto his newspaper he should be made\nto appreciate that there are other\ncorrespondents who represent Demo\ncratic newspapers who have sense\nenough to give a true report of what\noccurred."\nSome of those who were on the\nground and saw the reception for\nthemselves rather agree with Zacn\nMcGb.ee than the Times. Mr. James\nM. Jackson, one of the prominent\nbusiness*, mon of Augusta, Ga., has.\njust gotten back from New York af\nter a lengthy business stay. In talk\ning of his visit to the Augusta Her\nald, Mr. Jackson "says be was much\ndisappointed in the Roosevelt parade\nin New York last Saturday. It was\nnot the great demonstration it was\nannounced to be and the enthusiasm\nwas largely, manuffactured. The\nAbeccrombie .childre who had ridden\nhundreds of miles on horseback to\nsee Mr. Roosevelt attracted as mucti\nor more attention than did the ex\nPrfesident. Many places were not\ndecorated at all and those that were\nsimply hung out American flags."\nThe Herald says from this "Mr.\nJackson branched out to talk of pol\nitics, saying that many prominent\nRepublicans in New York Were sure\nthe Democrats would elect the next\nPresident. Everywhere he went, he\nsaid, he met this fear on the part\nof the Republicans and a correspond\ning elation of the Democrats^ The\nNorthern people were sick of the in\njustice of the tariff, which is now\na worse burden on the country than\n? before; The Republicans were pled\nged to a revision, but they made it a\nrevision, upward. They kept the let\nter of their promise by revising the\ntariff, but they abrogated the spirit\nof it entirely." Mr. Jackson is a,\nRepublican and a Northern man.\nTherefore, what he says about the\nRoosevelt reception would hardly be\ncolored to make it less than it was.\nHot Weather.\nAfter a cool slow spring.

Sum\nmer\'s heat enables everyone to live\nin the open air, and fill the lungs\nwith oxygeu. thus relieving us of\nthe many throat troubles that have\nI their origin in the bad air of the\nI heated hoines and offices of the win\nter.

C.', 'HELP* RURAL SCHOOLS\nREPRESENTATIVE BOWMAN HAS\nGOOD BILL PASSED.\nSeveral Schools in This County Have\nReceived Aid From the State to\nErect Better Buildings.\nLast year while the Legislature\nwas in session Mr. John S. Bowman,\none of Orangeburg\'s best, introduc\ned a bill to aid the construction of\nbetter school buildings in the var\nious Counties of the state. It ap\npropriated $20,000 of the money de\nrived from the Dispensary Winding\nUp Commission and devoted it to\nachool building purposes. ?\nThe manner in which it was to be\ndistributed was that whenever the\npatrons or trustees of a school had\nraised a certain amount for a school\nbuilding the state would give them\n$50 for every $100 so raised to\n?nable them to build a better build\ning.\nIt should be noticed that this bill\nwas intended to held the buildings.\nNo one school could receive more\nthan three hundred dollars, nor\nmore than one school receive aid in\nthe same district each year. If two\nschools consolidated a bonus of $50\n?was given, and the Superintendent\nof Education was directed to give\npreference to the schools which con\nsolidated. .\nThere are several schools in this\ncounty that have already taken ad\nvantage of this, and are already con\nstructing buildings. The Two Mile\nSwamp School Building, which was\ndemolished by a storm recently, has\ntaken advantage of the offer and are\ngoing to erect a $1,200 building,\n$300 of which t.hey will receive from\nthe state. The Cross Roads school\nand the Rickenbaker school have\nunited and are building a school at\nFerener\'s for which they will re\nceive the assistance of the state to\nthe amount of $350, the additional\n$50 being allowed on account of\nthe consolidation.\nIn addition to these two there are\nfive others about to take advantage\nof this liberality of the state, made\njlossible by Mr. Bowman\'s bilk\nRowesville has one school, but need\ning another, is going to build on\nthe corner of the lot another build\ning, and will receive $300 towards\nit. The Houser school, McCormick\nschool. Fridayville School, and . the\nOak Ridge School are ali consider\ning building better school houses.\nAs will be" observed this bill will\nbring between $1,500 and $2,000 to\nOrangeburg County this year alone,\nand thanks are due to Represents- j\ntive Bowman.\nDAMAGE BY LIGHTNING.\nSeveral Reports of Accidents During\n? i Electrical Storm.\nThursday afternoon during the\nthunderstorm lightning struck the\ntowner of the main building of the\nO.

It providss\nthat any ten men of lawful age\ncould form an asociation to protect\nthemselves against loss from fire,\ndisease, accidents, lightning, hail fail\nure of crops, and to insure the live\nstock of its members. It must be\nunderstood that this association is al\nlowed only to protect its members\nand is not organized with a purpose\nof making money, or enriching any\none . privately. These associations\nare only allowed to work in the coun\nty in which they were organized.\nBefore the state allows any of them\nto begin business the elected presi\ndent and secretary of the proposed\nasociation must Bwear that twenty\nfive men will take ont policies in it\nfor not less than a total sum of\ntwenty-five thousand dolars. This\nlist of subscribers must be sworn to\nand filed with the Insurance Com\nmisioner.\nEach member of the Asociation is\nentitled to one vote in the elections\nnecesary. It is required that a thirty\nday notice be given of each meeting\nby publishing the same in the county\npaper and by sending a postal to each\nmember of the association, who can\neither attend or send a proxy, but\nno man is permitted to vote more\nthan twenty, proxies or vote under\nthe orders of anyone having twenty\nproxies. Each asociation is required\nto meet at least once a year and elect\ndirectors and officers, the latiAr can\nnot be elected for a term longer than\ntwo years. The amount to be receiv\ned by each officer must be stipulated\nbefore the duties of the office are en\ntered upon or the work performed.\nThe manner in which this association\nwould pay the loses of its number\nwould be to assess each member\nequitably for the amount of the loss.\nShould upon investigation the Insur\nance Commissioner find that ay offi\ncer is neglecting to levy and collect\nany assessment made he may apply at\nany court having the proper author\nity for a mandamus to enforce the\nperformance of the neglected duty.\nThe premium is to be guaran\nteed by a note or lein on the property\ninsured, but the property must be so\ndescribed that a person could rec\nognize it from the description. Any\nof these asociations could create a\nJ reserve fund in the maner prescribed\nby their by-laws, provided it did not\nconflict with-;the laws of the state.\nFrom a table compiled by Insurance\nComissioner McMaster it is shown\nthat there are fifteen of these insur\nance asociations now at work in this\nState, carying from $191,604 to\n$4,425,040 insurance in\' force. The\nrates of these companies range from\n$l.S0,to $8,00 per thousand.\nHere is .w.hat Insurance Commis\nsioner McMaster says about them:\n"The salvation of these companies\nis to haye a director in each township\nwho will approve the insurance of\neach piece of property in his town\nship; to take only the class of prop\nerty, viz country residences and ten\nant houses; to take only a limited a\nmount of insurance, say $,1000 on\nany one peice of property; to have\nat least one annual meeting of the\npolicy holders at which the officers\nand directors are elected, and- at\nwhich complete reports are to be\nmade by the officers; to have quar\nterly meetings of the directors.\n"While a number of these asso\nsiations levy assessments as the fires\noccur, and while others levy assess\nments but once a year it is beleived\nthat it would be very much better and\nsafer to require the insured to pay\nin advance what is understood to be\nthe rate by the stock companies, and\nat the end of the, year to refund him\nwhatever the saving might be.\n"There are many other features\nconnected with the business needing\nexplanation and the insurance De\npartment will be glad to .answer any\ninquiries made."

An hour and a half\nafter the rain started he measured\nsix and a half inches of rain water\nin same. This tub flares a little to\nthe top, but it give a good idea of\ntEe amount of rain that fell. Som?\nthink eight or more inches fell, b-.it\nthis much is certainly known, thit\na damage of thousands of dillarij\n.has been done to the county.\nLightning also struck the dinirg\nroom chimney of Mr. Shirer during\nthe storm, ran down the center of\nsame, leaving a zigzag mark on same.\nWhen it struck the iron running\nacross the front of the fireplace it\nglanced ?ff and the bolt struck Miss\n?Rosa Shuler on her ankl**, rending\nher unconscious for about h\'.? an\nhour.
