Hayes, Cleveland la\nbor leader, as its Presidential\nand Vice Presidential nominee,\nrespectively.\nBut the strength of the n ew\ngovernment remains to be seen.\nThe first rest came today when\na group of dissatisfied delegates)\n. brmerly allied with the Com\nmittee of Forty-eight, met and\nconsidered placing their own\nicket in the field under the Forty-eight,\nbanner.\nNot all of the Forty-eight del\negates withdrew from the fusion\nconvention last night, when\nsome iuu or more returned to\ntheir own convention. Those\nwho remained were rewarded by\nSeeing Christensen, the chair\nman of their convention, select\ned to lead the fusion party,\nwhile the labor leaders conten\nted themselves with the selec\ntion of their national cha irraan,\nHayes, to second place.\nThe new party\'s Presidential\nnominee is a native of the West\nHe was born at Weston, Idaho, I\nforty-nine yesrs ago.

Yet there Is the concord\nof amity and sympathy and fraternity\nIn every resolution. There Is a genu\nine aspiration In every American\nbreast for a tranquil friendship with\nall the world.\nOne may readily sense sxhe con\nscience of our America. I am sure\nI understand the purpose of the dom\ninant group of the senate. We were\nnot seeking to defeat a world aspira\ntion, we were resolved to safeguard\nAmerica. We were resolved then, even\nas we are today, and will be tomor\nrow, to preserve this free and Ince\npendent republic.\nIn the call of the conscience of\nAmerica is peace, peace that closes the\ngaping wound of world war, and si\nlences the impassioned voices of In\nternational envy and distrust Heed\ning this call and knowing as I dp the\ndisposition of the Congress, I promise\nyou formal and effective peatfd so\nquickly as a Republican Congress can\npass Its declaration for a Republican\nexecutive to sign.\nIt Is better to be the free and\ndisinterested agent of International\nJustice and advancing civilization,\nwith the covenant of conscience, than\nbe shackled, by a written compact\nwhich surrenders our freedom of ac\ntion and gives to a military alliance\nthe right to proclaim America\'s duty\nto the world. No surrender of rights\nto a world .council or its military al\nliance, no assumed mandatary how\never appealing, ever shall summon the\nsons of this republic to war. Their\nsupreme sacrifice shall only be asked\nfor America and its call of honor.\nThere is a sanctity In that right wa\nwill not delegate.\nLeaving America Independent.\nDisposed as we are, the. way is very\nsimple. Let the failure attending as\nsumption, obstinacy, Impracticability\nand delay be recognized, and let us\nfind the big, practical, unselfish way\nto do our part, neither covetous be\ncause of ambition nor hesitant through\nfear, but ready to serve ourselves, hu\nmanity and God. With a senate ad\nvising as the constitution contemplates,\nI vould hopefully approach the nations\nof Europe and of the earth, proposing\nthat understanding which makes us a\nwilling participant in the consecra\ntion of nations to a new relationship,\nto commit the moral forces of the\nworld. America included, to peace and\ninternational justice, still leaving Am\nerica free, independent and self-reliant.\nbut offering friendship to all the world\nIt is folly to close our eyes to out\nstanding facts. Humanity Is restive,\nmuch of the world Is In revolution,\nthe agents of discord and destruction\nhave wrought their tragedy in pathetic\nRussia, have lighted their torches\namong other peoples, and hope to see\nAmerica as a part of the great Red\nconflagration. Ours Is the temple of\nliberty under the law, and It Is ours to\ncall the Sons of Opportunity to Its\' de\nfense. America must not only save\nherself, but ours must be the appeallnc\nvoice to sober the world.\nIt must be understood that toil a!on\nmakes for accomplishment and ad\nvancement, and righteous possession is\nthe reward of toil, and its Incentive.\nThere Is no progress except In the\nstimulus of competition.\nThe chief trouble today Is that the\nworld war wrought the destruction of\nhealthful competition, left our store\nhouses empty, and there is a minimum\nproduction when our need Is. max\nimum. Maximums, not minimums, is\nthe call of America. It Isn\'t a new\nstory, because war never falls to leave\ndepleted storehouses and always Im\npairs the efficiency of production. War\nalso establishes its higher standards\nfor wages, and they abide. I wish the\nhigher wage to abide, on one explicit\ncondition that the wage-earner will\ngive full return for tne wage received.\nProduction, More Production.\nI want, somehow, to appeal to the\nsons and daughters of the republic,\nto every producer, to join band and\nbrain In production, more production,\nhonest production, patriotic produc\ntion, because patriotic production is\nno less a defense of our best clvilizn\ntion than that of armed force. Profi\nteerlng is a crime of commission, under-production\nis a crlmeof omission\nWe must work our most and best, else\nthe destructive reaction will come.\nThe menacing tendency of the pres\nent day is not chargeable wholly to\nthe unsettled and fevered conditions\ncaused by the war. The manifest\nweakness In popular government lies\nIn the temptation to appeal to grouped\ncitizenship for political advantage.\nIt would be the blindness of folly o\nIgnore the activities In our own coun\ntry which are aimed to destroy orr\neconomic system, and to \'commit i:s tc\nthe colossal tragedy which has de\nstroyed all freedom and made RussiH\nimpotent. This movement is not to be\nhalted In throttled liberties. We must\nnot abridge the freedom of speech, the\nfreedom of press, or the freedom of\nassembly, because there Is no p.-omlsc\nIn repression. These liberties are us\nsacred as the freedom of religious re\nlief, as Inviolable as the rights of Hf\nand the pursuit of happiness. We do\nhold to the right to crush sedition, to\nstifle a menacing contempt for \'aw\nto stamp out a peril to the safety f\nthe republic or Its people, when emer\ngency calls, because security and Mie\nmajesty of the law are the first es\nsentials of liberty. He who threatens\ndestruction of the government by \' \',e\nor flaunts his contempt for lawful\nauthority, ceases to be a loyal citizen\nand forfeits his rights to the freedom\nof the republic\nNo party is indifferent to the welfare\nof \'the wage-earner. To us his good\nfortune Is of deepest concern, and we\nseek to make that good fortune per\nmanent We do not oppose but ap\nffOTe\' collective bargaining, because\nf that Is an outstanding right, but we\nare unalterably Insistent that Its exorcist-\nmust not destroy the equally sa\ncred right of the individual, in his nec\nessary pursuit of livelihood. Any\nAmerican has the right to quit his em\nployment, so has every American the\nright to seek employment The group\nmust not endanger the Individual, and\nwe must discourage groups preying\nupon one another, and none shall be\nallowed to forget that the government\'s\nobligations are alike to all the people.\nNo Strike Against Government\nWe are so confident that much of the\npresent-day Insufficiency and Inefficien\ncy of transportation are due to the\nwithering hand of government opera\ntion that we emphasize anew our oppo\nsition to government ownership, we\nwant to expedite the1 reparation and\nmake sure the mistake Is not repeated.\nA state of inadequate transporta\ntion facilities, mainly chargeable to\nthe failure of governmental experi\nment Is losing millions to agriculture,\nit Is hindering Industry, It Is menac\ning the American people with a fuel\nshortage little less than a peril. It em\nphasizes the present-day problem and\nsuggests that spirit of encouragement\nand assistance which commits all\nAmerica to relieve such an emergency.\nGross expansion of currency and\ncredit have depreciated the dollar Just\nas expansion and Inflation have dis\ncredited the coins of the wo.rld. We\nInflated In haste, we must deflate In\ndeliberation. We debased the dollar\nIn reckless finance, we must restore In\nhonesty.\nIn all sincerity we promise the pre\nvention of unreasonable profits, we\nchallenge profiteering with all the mor\nal force and the legal powers of gov\nernment and people, but It Is fair, aye.\nIt is timely, to give reminder that law\nis not the sole corrective of our eco\nnomic ills.\nDrive Against Extravagance.\nLet us call to all the people for\nthrift and economy, for denial and sac\nrifice If need be, for a nation-wide\ndrive against extravagance and lux\nury, to a recommittal to simplicity of\nliving, to that prudent and normal plan\nof life which Is the health of the re\npublic. New conditions, which attend amaz\ning growth and extraordinary Indus\ntrial development, call for a new and\nforward-looking program. The Ameri\ncan farmer had a hundred and twenty\nmillions to feed in the home market,\nand heard the cry of the world for\nfood und answered It, though he faced\nan appalling task amid handicaps\nnever encountered before.\nContemplating the defenselessness of\nthe Individual farmer to meet the or\nganized buyers of his products and the\ndistributors of the things the farmer\nbuys, I bold that farmers should not\nonly be permitted but encouraged to\nJoin In co-operative association to reap\nthe Just measure of reward merited by\ntheir arduous toll.\nOur platform Is an earnest pledge ot\nrenewed concern for this most essen\ntial and elemental Industry and In\nboth appreciation and Interest we\npledge effective expression In law and\npractice. We will hall that co-operation\nwhich again will make profitable\nand desirable the ownership and op\neratlon of comparatively small farms\nIntensively cultivated, and which will\nfacilitate the caring for the products\nof farm and orchard without the\nlamentable waste under present condi\ntions.\nAmerica would look with anxiety on\nthe discouragement of farmlhg ac\ntlvity either through the government\'s\nneglect or Its paralysis by socialistic\npractices. A Republican administra\ntion will be committed to renewed re\ngard for agriculture, and seek the\nparticipation of farmers in curing the\nills Justly complained of, and aim to\nplace the American farm where it\nought to be highly ranked in Amerl-\nran activities and fully sharing th\nhighest good fortunes of American\nlife.\nBecomingly associated with this\nsubject ate the policies of irrigation\nand reclamation, so essential to agri\ncultural expansion, and the continued\ndevelopment of the great and wondr\nful West. It Is our purpose to eon\nilnue and enlarge federal aid, not in\nsectional partiality, but for the good\nof all America.\nI believe the budget system will ef\nfect a necessary, helpful reformation\nand reveal business methods to gov\nernment business.\nI believe federal departments should\nbe made more business-like and send\nback to productive effort thousands\nof federal employees, who are either\nduplicating work or not essential at\nall.\nI believe In the protective tariff\npolicy and know we will be calling for\nits saving Americanism again.\nI believe In a great merchant ma\nrine.

It has seemed to me that our\nundeveloped, uncertain and infirm\npolicy has made us a culpable party to\nthe governmental misfortunes in that\nland.

Young who\ntook us out in his car, Mr. Har\nris with us too, making a run np\nto Aberdeen, and paying Mr.\nMurrell and family a short visit,\ngoing back to West Point, we\nwent down as far as Macon, ac\ncompanied by Mr. Young,. went\nout to the farm owned by him\nand Mr. Gill. Mr. Gills son met\nus at Macon with his car, so we\nformed the acpuaintance of Mr.\nGill\'s kind and friendly family,\nwho lodged and cared for us\nvery entertainingly. This farm\nhas 1128 acres in it, 212 head of\ncattle on it, and meadow enough\nto almost make a fellow rich,\nbut Mr.\' Gill and boys with some\nhelp, was showing their grit by\ngoing right after it. We learned\nwhile there that the average\nmeadow was cut four times and\nyielded from three fourths of a\nton to two tons of fine hay per\n.acre, also having a higher feed\ning value than timothy hay. I\ncan\'t see why a man can\'t make\na living down there pretty easy.\nBut he don\'t have to depend on\ngrass and hay alone, one can\nraise most any thing that he may\nwant to. While I was down there\nI saw a lot of very fine land, and\nbetter yet, taking the people as\na whole I think them the best\npeople I ever met. Also went to\nchurch- twice and will say\nthat there is plenty of nice\nchurches, schools and good\nroads. Taking them all into con\nsideration it is useless to say\nthat the people all seemed con\ntented and happy, some seemed\nto be inthused insomuch that I\nheard language like this: "When\nGeneral Pershing returned to\nAmerica after being victorious\nover the German army that the\npeople met him tooting horn3,\nhallooing, throwing up hats and\nwaving handkerchiefs, but when\nhe returned to Columbia that the\npeople commemorated by going\nright to killing chickens.
