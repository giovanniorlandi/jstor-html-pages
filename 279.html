Some AFRC leaders \nwanted to deepen the military mission. But others \nknew that profound ethnic and other fissures were \nalready appearing within the military, that its attacks \non market women and traders and its public canings \nwere again creating a fear of the military, and that an \nattempt to remain in power would rekindle public \nopposition and destroy the military completely.\nThe impact of AFRC’s four months in power was \nprofound and important, but it did not solve Limann’s \nproblems. It restored hope to Ghanaians and rein\xad\ntroduced moral force in public life; and it created the \npossibility that the PNP government could be a far \nbetter government than it would otherwise have been. \nBut it also created a military and police with little \ncoherence and discipline, a potential source of new \nmilitary coups. As a condition of the transfer of power \nto a civilian government, on September 24, 1979, the \nPNP had to agree to continue AFRC’s investigations \nand not to reverse any sentences of its secret tribunal. \nLimann felt compelled to retire Rawlings and two \nsenior officers who publicly attacked his actions and \nsought reinstatement. The forced sales of commodities \nat control prices emptied Ghana of goods, and farmers \nhave withheld their produce from the market and \ninvested little in renewed plantings, which means a \nshortfall of food in the spring of 1980. Though Limann \npromised to “ flood Ghana with goods” for Christmas, \n1979, Ghana has little or no foreign exchange, and the \nIMF is again demanding an austerity program of \nreduced government expenditures and bank credits \nand a devaluation, in exchange for new foreign loans. \nGhanaians hope that the new government will under\xad\ntake spending programs to increase the level of eco\xad\nnomic activity, but the government has few resources. \nIn this sense, Ghana has regained democratic rule \nunder the worst possible circumstances. And military \nrule has been totally discredited.\nThe restoration of democratic civilian rule is no \nguarantee that the governments of Ghana and Nigeria \nwill be able to cope with endemic social conflicts or to \nfashion economic development policies that generate \ngrowth instead of distributing the overwhelming pro\xad\nportion of benefits to a small but growing bourgeoisie \nof businessmen, professionals, and bureaucrats, ignor\xad\ning the needs of workers and peasants. ■\n']</pre>
