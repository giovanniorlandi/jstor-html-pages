Our polio yshould be to conserve llmt priii.\nciplc.\nOne of the fundamental rules of economic law is to give to lalior\nits due reward in wages. To accomplish this, the industries employ\ninir labor must he kent in a. wholesome and nrosDerous state. This\nlatter condition can only be brought about by the government giving\nto its industries the protection and encouragement that they deserve.\nThis can only be realized through a consistent and all-Ameriean sys\ntem of Tariff Protection whereby America will preserve to its bul\nwarks of industry and labor the fruits of their endeavors.\nOur country prospers or suffers depression according to the state\nof its industries. Farming and agriculture play a very important\npart in the prosperity of the nation. In fact to a great extent the\nbuying power of the nation is dependent upon the prosperity of the\nfarmer. In order to derive from the soil the maximum amount of\nproduce, our citizens must be encouraged to enter into funning as\nan industry. Before this can be brought about, the government must\nguarantee to the farmer a ready market for his products. No self\nrespecting American farmer can be expected to put his untiring ef\nforts into agricultural pursuits, and pay to his farm labor a decent\nAmerican wage, if lie knows that when be sends bis produce to mar\nket, it is to be sold in competition with cheap products imported from\nOriental and otKer foreign countries where underpaid and underfed\nlabor is employed, and where living conditions are obnoxious com\npared to those in America.\nThis same condition applies to the American manufacturer, who\nemplays American labor at a wage which insures to the worker a de\ncent living. He cannot continue this if forced to sell his output at a\nprice regulated by the cheap products of foreign labor and industry.\nIf the foreigner is to derive profits from the markets of America,\nhe should be made to pay for that privilege. American farmers and\nmanufacturers arc subject to taxes an dother revenues here for the\nsupport o fthe government. The only way in which foreigners can\nbe made to participate in this contribution to the support of the\ngovernment of the country in which they seek to derive profits\nthrough the sale of their merchandise, is to levy a duty on those\nproducts on their entry into the country. In order that the foreigner\nmaj not have an. advantage over the domestic producer and manu\nfacturer in our home markets, the duty should be high enough to\nmake up for the difference in the cost of labor and production here\nand that in foreign coutnries.\nThe American markets shoould be insured to the American pro\nducer, and guaranteed against competition from the underpaid, un\nderfed and oppressed inhabitants of Orental an dother foreign countries.\nFEDERAL DEPARTMENT OP EDUCATION.\nIt is not pleasing to realize that the I\'nited States stands ninth\nr.mong the nations of the world in the general educational level of its\npeople. Bu, if the report of the House Committee on Education is\nto be credited, that is the unenviable position occupied by the alleged\ngreatest and most progressive among civilized counties.\nThe report of the committee recommends the passage of the\nSmith-Towner bill to establish a Federal Department of Education\nwith Federal aid in increasing educational facilities.\nAccording to the report illiteracy is a national and not a sec\ntional problem. The statistics cited show illiteracy almost equally\nprevalent in every section of the country. This surprising informa\ntion should prove a shock to the national complacency. It also should\nserve to expedite the creation of every possible remedial agency\nnecessary to correct this ominous situation.\nThe Smith-Towner bill offers, according to the report, "the only\nmeans of correcting the present inequality of educational opportuni\nties among the various communities and preventing waste of public\nfunds and inefficiency due to lack of co-ordination among Federal\nagencies dealing with education."\nThat is as may me. Hut common sense informs that this regret\ntable situation tremendously can be improved through individual and\ncommunity action. Federal aid would be welcome, a Federal De\npartment of Education would seed to be eminently desirable,, but the\nmass of people generally must be led to understand and appreciate\nthe value of education. \' There is nothing more important in our\nscheme of Government. No tax levied for educational purposes ever\nshould be regarded as too onerous to be borne. The public schools\nmust be strengthened, supported developed and encouraged until\nwe as a nation stand on the educational level not ninth, but first\nJ. B. KEEPS NAGGING.\nJohn Bull keeps up his discrimination against American trade.\nFreight rates from New York to the United Kingdom arc fixed by\nthe Eastern Freight Conference at $1.00 per 100 pounds on many com\nmodities, which from New York to French and Channel ports rates\nfor the sarao commodities very from 20 to 50 cents per 100 pounds.\nFrom New York to Dutch ports the rate is 30 cents. The American\nexporters are getting around this by routing shipments of goods to\nUnited Kingdom via the Continent. Possibly a little ttasle of max\nimum and minimum tariff might bring John Bull to his senses. As\nnoon aa that is proposed some of our weak sisters will accuse us of\nholding a club over European competitors, ignoring the fact that\nEngland is belaboring us with her big stick.\nTOOT SWEET.\n, France has decreased her unfavorable trade balance by eleven\nWllion francs in 1920, compared with 1910. That means that the\nvalue of the franc with soon begin to climb.
