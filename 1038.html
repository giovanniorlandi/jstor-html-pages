Most recently, the, greatest emphasis was naturally on the raising of funds from the community and, as a, grant, from the Federal Government. For this, a special campaign committee was formed, with Mr. Marvin H. Volk as general chairman and Mr. Jacob F. Fruchthendler as ex, ecutive vice-chairman, and Mr. Benj. N. Brook, as the executive director. The entire, roster of committee people is no less important because it is too long to list here. The, community knows of the success of the campaign to this point, accomplished under, extraordinarily capable direction, with many, many dedicated workers; and the com, munity is appreciative. This success does not conclude the money raising effort; at, least $50,000.00 remains to be raised., But this success does now require a more definite nursing home committee to replace, the interim committees. The Executive Board of the Council, recognizing this need,, on Friday last, created such a committee by a vote which reads principally as follows:, VOTED; To create a committee of this Council—known as the trustee of the Nursing, Home whose responsibility and present authority is the erection, development,, maintenance, and operation of the council’s Nursing Home for the Aged., PROVIDED THAT:, (1) the number of trustees shall not exceed twenty-five (25)., (2) the officers and a sub-committee of the trustees shall be prescribed and ap, pointed by the President of the Council. The term of each trustee shall be, one (1) year., (3) the trustees may make financial arrangements of any kind with the prior, consent of the Council Executive Board; it being intended that blanket con, sent may be granted by the approval of a nursing home budget, of any kind., (4) the Executive Board of the Council reserves, as it must, the right and power, to change or amend all or any part of this entire vote., (5) it is contemplated that the method of governing the Nursing Home will, evolve with experience and the Executive Board of this Council will be, guided by such experience., Pursuant to this vote, and after consultation with the campaign leadership, I appointed, from among those who qualify by their contribution and by their effort, interest and, judgment, the following trustees and officers:, Jacob C. Fruchthendler, President, Marvin H. Volk Vice-Chairman, Sidney M. Gilberg Treasurer, Mrs. Harry Gorodcss Secretary, Philip Besserman David Kramer, Mrs. Meyer Cohen Mrs. Minnie Meyer, David A. Garber Mel Ritter, Morris Grossman Ben H. Solot, Dr. Milton Goldberger Dr. Henry Stanford, Mrs. William Gordon Joseph Timan, I. H. Handmaker Charles Wilson, Sol Kamin David Wine, Dr. Boris Zemsky, As circumstances suggest additional trustees will be appointed to complete the pre, scribed number., The community is grateful to all who have served thus far to create this home with its, endless potential for public service. Those who have already served, and many who, have not, will be asked for their effort upon the sub-committees which will be formed, as we become more aware of the needs of the home., Eluman Rights ruling, which, forbids all fraternities here, to discriminate against mem, bers who are Jews, Negroes, or Orientals., Phi Delta Theta is the last, Page Three, fraternity on the campus still, holding out against the Hu, man Rights rule. Five other, fraternities accredited by the, faculty have recently settled, their problem about failure, to comply with the rule.]", '[Page Four, Editorial Comment, How Others Look At Centers, Jewish Community Centers have be, come so popular across the nation that, today they are being taken for granted., Not so long ago Centers could be found, only in the larger cities. For many years, only the Young Men’s Christian Associa, tion served Tucson youth from the stand, point of public athletic facilities. It serv, ed Tucson well and continues to do so., But in this growing community the, Tucson Jewish Community Center has, relieved the YMCA of part of its burden., The Jewish Center has a program that, serves, not only the Jewish community,, but the entire community with myriad, services., We’d like you to read some opinions of, the value of Jewish Centers from na, tional leaders. For example:, ABRAHAM RIBICOFF, Secretary of, Health, Education and Welfare: “Jewish, Community Centers provide significant, community service by helping people of, all ages to use their leisure hours con, structively for their development as ac, tive citizens of our land. These local or, UN\'s New Leader, U Thant Friendly To Israel, UNITED NATIONS, N. Y.—The man, designated for the highest post in the, United Nations Secretariat, U Thant of, Burma, faces, in some respects, the tough, est job as yet confronting any of the pre, vious Secretaries-General here. For, on, one front, U Thant personally, as well as, his Government and his Prime Minister, U Nu, are committed. They are committed, to peace between the Arabs and Israel., Not merely in the formal sense, but ac, tively., Both Trygve Lie and Dag Hammarsk, jold, U Nu’s predecessors, worked for, peace in general, which includes the Mid, dle East. But, unlike the others, U Thant, had spoken up on the Middle East issue,, not once but many times —and he had, done so in the friendliest possible terms, as far as Israel is concerned., U Nu and U Thant, as is well known,, had visited Israel in 1955. Later, Burma, published a book giving its evaluation, of Israel. It was no secret that the book, had been written by U Thant—since he, had been press director for his govern, ment and, in 1955, secretary for projects, in the office of Prime Minister U Nu., Just what Burma thinks of the possi, bility of peace between the Arab states, and Israel has been spelled out many, times by both U Nu and U Thant. What, they want, first of all, is Arab recognition, of Israel. “As long as our Arab friends, refuse to accept the fact of Israel,’’ said, U Nu, “there can be no real progress, toward a solution. But once this fact is, accepted, we feel that the principal psy, chological barrier to a settlement will be, removed, and the way opened to the, ending of the present deadlock.’’, Boris Smolar:, Catholic Leader Praises Jews, A new and very friendly tone toward, Jews is advanced in a volume on Juda, ism published as part of “The 20th Cen, tury Encyclopedia of Catholicism.”, The author of this volume, entitled “Ju, daism,” is Father Paul Demann. an emi, nent authority on theological history . . ., He believes that the break between Jews, and Christians during the early days of, Christianity will some day be mended., And he calls upon Catholics to consider, the Jews as their “elder brothers” and to, “understand the life and tradition of Ju, daism.” He reminds the Catholic world, that the Jews are still truly members of, Israel, of that Israel of the Bible, which, is “the root from which Christianity, springs.”, He goes into analysis of the question:, What is a Jew —whether the Jews are a, race, a people, or followers of a certain, religion. And he comes to the conclusion, ganizations are doing a wonderful job in, providing social, recreational and educa, tional facilities for their members . ., ARTHUR S. GOLDBERG, Secretary of, Labor: “The Jewish Community Centers, have made important contributions, through their social, welfare and recrea, tional facilities. Their efforts are vital to, the maintenance of a strong, vigoi’ous and, free society ...”, NEWTON N. MINOW, chairman, Fed, eral Communications Commission: “As a, member of the board of directors of the, Jewish Community Centers of Chicago, I, had the opportunity to see at close range, how leisure time was actually used for, individual and community objectives. It, seemed to me that the constructive group, activities in which individuals engaged, had a preventive aspect. Undoubtedly,, young people, perhaps particularly teen, agers, who are given the opportunity and, guided to engage in meaningful and sat, isfying activity are less likely to seek, undesirable means as an outlet for their, energies ...”, On every occasion possible, since U, Nu made that statement to his own Cham, ber of Deputies in 1957, U Thant has been, quoting that speech. What he wants,, above all, is (1) Arab recognition of Is, rael; and (2) peace negotiations between, the Arab states and Israel., It must be recalled that, though very, friendly to Israel, Burma has never alien, ated the Arabs. Burma attended the Band, ung Conference in 1955—as well as the, Belgrade Conference of “neutral” nations, last summer. And, at each of these con, ferences, as well as at many others, it, was U Thant who represented his Gov, ernment., At 52, this small, smiling, quiet man., who has served his Government actively, for exactly ten years, is a highly skilled, diplomat. He is too good a diplomatic, craftsman to seek or try to achieve melo, dramatic success. But there is no doubt, that the Middle East and its problems—, foremost among them Arab-Israeli hostili, ties—rank highest among his regional, priorities. That is where he faces that, toughest challenge of all., Patience will be required on the part, of all sides—Arab and Israel. But the, good will is there as well as the skill to, back up the best of intentions. U Thant, could talk to Nasser as even Hammarsk, jold could not —because he is trusted. At, the same time, he has the highest con, fidence of the Israelis., The dark hour when Hammarskjold, died for peace may yet, in the person of, U Thant, turn out to have been the dawn, of a new day, when peace will be sought, by the quiet, friendly man from Burma., that there are several ways of being a, Jew, but this does not prevent the Jews, from forming an entity whoSe cohesion,, permanence and “personality” stand out, with extra-ordinary vigor. He calls upon, Christians to look with sincerity, under, standing and respect upon the Jew as, “the elder brother who has suffered so, much and, in spite of everything, has, been faithful to his share of the heritage.”, He outlines the history of Jewish-Chris, tian relations, and gives a brief and sym, pathetic review of the history of Judaism., Father Demann finds that Judaism has, become stronger because of the Nazi mas, sacres and the establishment of Israel., Each of the two events, he points out,, brought about a re-awakening of Jewish, consciousness among Jews, which had, been somewhat deadened by a century of, assimilation., -THE ARIZONA POST, pillll!l!l!lllllllllllllllilllll!lllll!l!lllllllilllllli:t!lll!lllll]i:i:i!l!ll, | panorama, Illllllllllllllllllli by David Schwartz, AS SOME of the readers of, this column may be aware, I, recently got out a book called, Hanukkah Latkes and Roths, child’s Millions., Naturally, I have been ask, ed, why I did it., The uncle of Heine once, said of his famous nephew, that if he had learned a trade,, he wouldn’t have to write, books., That’s one reason I sup, pose why people write books., • • •, SOME GOOD people have, written books and there are, some who have resisted the, temptation. I don’t believe, that anyone should gloat over, the fact that he has not writ, ten a book. Remember, that, but for the grace of God, you, too may write one. It is a, commonplace that there is a, book in every man., A famous rabbi was urged, to publish his sermons, but, rejected the idea., “What will happen?” he, asked, “if I write a book?”, “Some good Jew after the, Sabbath kugel will pick it up, and proceed to fall asleep.”, • • •, However, I must say this, does not apply in my case., Dr. Hillel Seidman of the, Jewish Day-Morning Journal, told me that one night he, couldn’t sleep. He lay tossing,, so he took up Hanukah Lat, kes and read it from cover to, cover. It interested him so, he, didn’t mind not sleeping., Dr. Seidman and others, have enjoyed Hanukkah Lat, kes, but I can’t say that I, haven’t had some criticisms., • • •, ONE MAN, and I must say, a person of considerable Jew, ish learning, challenged, something I wrote in it. I, said that the name Adlai, stemmed from the Bible. He, didn’t think so. Well, I was, right. It is found in Chroni, cles, Chapter 27, verse 29., There we are told of the var, ious appointments made by, King David. It is quite an, interesting chapter despite, the fact that it is mostly, names. For instance, there is, mention of 4,000 “with in, struments to praise the, Lord.” If you think the Phil, harmonic is some orchestra,, read this chapter., After the part dealing with, the musicians, we are told of, other appointments. One man, to head the vineyards, anoth, er the olive plantations and, then towards the bottom, we, come to the passage, “As the, keeper of the herds of the, valley, Shafat the son of, Adlai.”, • • •, I DON’T know whether, this has any symbolic refer, ence to the United Nations,, although they are pretty, much in the valley just now, and most of us hope with, possibly Adlai’s help, it will, get out of the rut., The Hebrew name Adlai is, defined variously. In one, place, “the justice of God,”, and elsewhere I have seen it, defined as “my ornament.”, Hanukkah Latkes was also, criticized by several people, for its inclusion of a piece on, Jewish swearing. These good, people thought I should not, have dealt with profanity. Ac, tually, however, I wasn’t par, ticularly concerned with that, aspect. I was interested in, swearing as an art and wish, ed to show its cultural and, even religious overtones. For, instance, the curse usually, reserved for the bitter anti-, Semite, "May he lose all of, his teeth save one for tooth, ache,” has an element of, Jewish compassion in it., I trust no one will get the, idea that this is intended as, a plug for my book. That, would be unethical.
