        <pre>["BOOK REVIEWS\nON AMERICAN POLITICS\nTHE PRESIDENCY REAPPRAISED. Edited by \nR exford G. T ugwell and T homas E. Cronin. \n(New York: Pracger Publishers, 1974. 297 pages, \nbibliography and index, $8.95.)\nFifteen challenging essays in this symposium ex\xad\nplore the development of the office of the American \npresidency—“ventures in reappraisal”—as the \neditors phrase the aim of the book. Noting the \nrising volume of criticism of the presidency, the \neditors hope “that these essays may stimulate an \nurgently needed reappraisal of an inherited but \nseemingly essential institution fast becoming incon\xad\nsistent with cherished democratic ideals.” The \nvolume opens with a study of the President’s con\xad\nstitutional position and moves on to consider “The \nExpanding Presidency and the Role of Congress” ; \n“The Presidential Condition” ; “The Presidential \nPerson” ; and the problems of “presidential perfor\xad\nmance and accountability.” A challenging final \nessay by Rexford Tugwell, “On Bringing Presidents \nto Heel,” offers suggestions for constitutional re\xad\nform. O.E.S.\nTHE LIVING PRESIDENCY. By Emmet J ohn \nH ughes. (New York: Coward, McCann and \nGeoghegan, Inc., 1973. 368 pages, notes, sources, \nspecial supplement, and index, $10.50.)\nProfessor of Politics at Rutgers and one-time \nassistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, \nEmmet John Hughes has written a penetrating \nanalysis of the office of the presidency and the way \nthat office has been shaped by the men who served \nas Presidents of the United States.\nThe study opens with the query John Jay ad\xad\ndressed to George Washington, before Washington \nbecame President and before Jay became first \nChief Justice: “Shall we have a King?” The pe\xad\nculiarly American nature of the presidency has \nbeen apparent to many observers. From the hesita\xad\ntions of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, to \nthe conflicts between Congress and the President \nalmost 200 years later, the presidential office has \ndeveloped to meet the needs of the nation and to \nallow the President to cope with the enormous re\xad\nsponsibilities of his job. Hughes discusses the idea \nof the presidency, and the mystery of the presidency \nbefore going on to focus on the “Man in the White \nHouse,” “The Gates of the White House,” re\xad\nstraints on presidential power, the range of presi\xad\ndential power, and the destiny of the presidency.\nWriting of the threat of presidential power, \nHughes notes that the peril “follows from an ex\xad\ntravagance of the specific freedom and authority \nenjoyed by the Chief Executive to make foreign war \nand foreign policy.” Hughes does not believe that \na broad reassertion of congressional power would be \na “saving corrective.” He does suggest what he \nterms, in the words of James Bryce, “small improve\xad\nments” in the presidency’s institutional behavior. \nFirst, he suggests “clear Congressional control of \nselective service,” to limit the President’s ability to \nmake military commitments. Second, he urges \n“faithful observance of some formal liaison with \nCongressional leaders that allows for private de\xad\nliberating of any major foreign policy decision.” \nThird, he would like to see an arrangement whereby \nthe President would submit to Congress or to some \nagency of Congress “the substance of .any executive \nagreement of a military nature.” A similar under\xad\nstanding should be reached with regard to the \nexercise of executive privilege. Last, the Depart\xad\nment of State should be restored to “its traditional \nplace in the formulating of foreign policy.”\nHughes closes by offering a view of the union be\xad\ntween the people and their President as “a kind of \nmarriage,” and reiterates his belief that mutual \ndistrust is the force that can “break a president.” \nA presidency of “honest and wise men,” he con\xad\ncludes, is the hope of the Republic.\nA special supplement includes the views of 12 \nmen who have worked closely with Presidents in \nthe recent past, who provide additional insights \ninto the challenges and responsibilities of the pres\xad\nidency. O.E.S.\nWHO SHAKES THE MONEY TREE? By George \nT hayer. (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973. \n301 pages, bibliography, and index, $8.95.)\nAmerican campaign financing practices arc \ntraced from 1789 to the present. Money wasn’t \nalways a source of corruption; it didn’t take long, \nhowever, for it to become firmly entrenched in the \nAmerican political process. The author show's not \nonly how money is raised and from whom, but \nwhat the contributors hope to gain with their \nmoney. The Fat Cat is seen hoping to get a \nfavorable antitrust ruling or just the “President’s \near,” and the local businessman is looking for a snow- \nremoval contract. “This book attempts to show \nthings as they really are and the way they might\n(C ontinued on page 277)\n268\n", 'Articles Concluded •  277\nAMENDMENT XXV (1967).\nSection 1.

By M ichael Novak. \n(New York: The Macmillan Co., 1974. 324 \npages, selected bibliography and index, $7.95.)\nMichael Novak has written about the American \npresidency as it really operates among “and is\nperceived in the different world in which Americans \nlive.” He believes that “the presidency is the \nnation’s most central religious symbol, and that \nAmerican civilization is best understood as a set \nof secular religious systems.” He feels that Ameri\xad\ncans expect a degree of honesty from our leaders \nthat people of other lands do not expect; our \nPresidents are authentic folk heroes, and when \ntheir shining symbolism is revealed as only a surface \nfilm, covering up serious faults, they fall from \npopular grace.\nNovak maintains that the American people elect \nas President a man who is priest, prophet and \nking; the office of “President is not clearly bounded. \nIn the absence of clarity, he can do what he can \nget away with doing.” When a President has es\xad\ntablished his right to the symbolic powers of the \noffice—his “mandate”—as Richard Nixon success\xad\nfully did in 1972, the entire scope of his powers \nbecomes much greater; “when the king is riding \na crest of approbation he is in greatest peril. When \nhe violates the public symbols, as a Nixon permis\xad\nsive to crime in White House Operations, the blow \nfalls with little mercy.” Franklin Roosevelt and \nLyndon Johnson also lost the godhead during their \nadministrations.\nThe author shows how moral symbols have been \nused by politicians to gain political power, citing \nnumerous examples among present-day candidates \nand office-holders. He contends that “moralism \ndisguises the power base and real interests of its \nown constituencies.” George McGovern seemed to \ngive many Americans the impression that he was \npreaching down to them; he was unable to get \ninside the people. Richard Nixon comforted the \nrestlessness of the people by “repetition of the frag\xad\nments of the old national faith.” According to \nNovak, the instinct of a President “for ends and \nmeans ‘characteristically American’ remains subject \nto searching judgment and trampling retribution.”\nNovak ends this well-written book with sugges\xad\ntions for the reform of the presidency.

(New York: The Mac\xad\nmillan Co., 1974, paper. 197 pages and photo\xad\ngraphs, $4.95.)\nThe collaborators on this book have produced \nan interesting and impressive combination of \nwritten and photographic journalism. The text, \nlargely unfavorable to President Nixon and his \nformer staff, is handsomely illustrated with photo\xad\ngraphs of most of the participants in the Watergate \naffair. William Shannon has given an account of \nthe Watergate story to October, 1973. O.E.S.\n']</pre>
