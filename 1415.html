is\nhoped by many persons will prove to\nbe the beginning of the end of Eli\njah Sandfords notorious Shiloh col\nony took place today wnen Governoi\nCobb and the executive council gave\na hearing to those who have com\nplained against the Holy Ghost and\nUs Society Just what the result will\nbe is problematical but it is general\nly believed that such strong pressure\nwill be brought to bear on the gover\nnor that he will urge the next session\nof the legislature to probe the affairs\nof Shiloh with a view to suppressing\nthe colony If sufficient evidence can\nbe obtained to warrant such

an opportune time to push\nit to a finish One reason is the ap\nproaching session of the legislature\nanother is the absence of Elijah\nSandford who is on the way to the\nHoly Land with some one hundred\nand fifty disciples In the yacht Coro\nnet and barkentine the Kingdom The\nthird and most urgent cause is the\nconviction that in the coming jlnter\nthe inhabitants of Shiloh are liable
