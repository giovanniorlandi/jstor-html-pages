OREGON, THURSDAY, JUNE 24, 1915\nNUMBER 9\nAsh\nAnother Ashland\nBooster Made\nM. J, Geary, general Pacific coast\nagent for the Rock Island railroad\nlines with headquarters at Portland,\nwas a visitor in the city recently. He\nwas taken over the city and was pre\nsented with a set of scenic photos of\nAshland scenes, which he promised to\nplace In the window of his Portland\noffice.\nThe following letter was received\nfrom M. Geary:\n"Dear Sir: My dear friend, Mr.\nGeorge Kramer of the Southern Pa\ncific railway, gave me the treat of my\nlife this morning. lie took me\nthrough Ashland\'s natural park, the\nmost beautiful one I have ever been\nIn. With such beauty at your door\nthere are no limits to your tourist\npossibilities. You are doing a won\nderful work for Ashland and Oregon\nin developing these natural beauty\nspots where the tourist from the east,\nwest, north and south will come by\nrail and auto to enjoy the fruits of\nyour labor. Progressive, original and\npersistent advertising will bring their\njust reward, and as you have the\ngoods to deliver every visitor will be\na booster. M. J. GEARY."\nDispatchers Are\nStill At Roseburg\nNothing further has been learned\nlocally of the Intended removal of the\ndispatchers\' office either to this city\nor to Portland. The following clip\npings from the Roseburg News would\nindicate that the officials of the road\nare as yet undecided as to the new\nlocation:\nThe work of installing the tele\ngraph instruments in the Southern\nPacific ticket depot, preparatory to\nthe removal of the dispatchers\' office\nto Portland, was practically com\'\npleted this evening. When the dis\npatchers\' office will be discontinued\nhere could not be determined this\nmorning. Monday\'s Review.\nHarry Pearce, president of the\nRoseburg Commercial Club, this\n, morning received a telegram from\n\'William Sproule, president of: the\nSouthern Pacific Railway . Company,\nwith headquarters at San Francisco,\nin which tfie latter stated that no\naction would be taken with reference\nto moving the dispatchers\' office\nfrom Roseburg until the proposition\nbad been given mature consideration.\nThe telegram from Mr. Sproule was\nreceived in reply to a protest recently\nsent to Mr. Sproule by a number of\nprominent Roseburg citizens. Tues\nday\'s Review.\nA telegram was received at the\nlocal Southern Pacific headquarters\nthis morning in which the Roseburg\nofficials of the company were In\nstructed to continue the dispatchers\'\noffice In this city. It was announced\na few days ago that the dispatchers\'\noffice was to move, and a formal pro\ntest signed by a number of Roseburg\ncitizens was later filed with Presi\ndent Sproule of the S. P. company at\nSan Francisco. Today\'s telegram was\nreceived here with \' delight, for the\nreason that it assures the continuance\nof an annual payroll here of nearly\n$10,000. Wednesday\'s Review.\nAshlanders Escape\nEarthquake Shock\nA series of earthquake shocks inland work In the promotion of those\nthe Imperial valley In California did things that were going to make Ash\ndamage estimated at $1,000,000 and hand grow. He spoke of the value to\nruined the homes of many of the res\nIdents. Several fires started In the\nvalley. Eldridge McWilliams, son of\nF. G. McWilliams and Frances McWil\nliams, are visiting their parents In\nthis city and Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Peck,\nwife and baby daughter, are visiting\nIn Berkeley. Mrs. Peck is also a\ndauehter of F. G. McWilliams. All of\nthese have homes in the Imperial val\nley. Mr. McWilliams has been the\nrecipient of many inquiries concern\ning their safety. Luckily, none of\nthem were in the valley at the time\nof the disturbance. Five persons are\nreported killed by falling . walls In\nMexicali, just over the Mexican bor\nder. The Irrigation system upon\nwhich Eldridge McWilliams is em\nployed is reported to be ., injured\n\'slightly by the shocks. ,\nThis week Chautauqua season tick\nets will be sold for 75 cents less than\nthe regular price of season tickets at\nother assemblies having only elx or\neven days session, without the gen\neral Chautauqua features. Tickets\nat 81 Oak street from 2 to 5 each\nafternoon, commencing Tuesday. 8-2t\n, \'!.: .Ill \'\nDivert Tourists s\nFrom Highway\nBusiness men and traveling men\ncoming from Portland state that the\nPortland merchants and various or\nganizations are actively engaged In\ndiverting tthe auto touriBt traffic\nover the eastern Oregon route Instead\nof the Pacific highway through west\nern Oregon. Medford merchants have\nstarted a campaign to bring such In\nfluence to bear on Portland men as\nto cause this unjust diversion of traf\nfic to be stopped. Local merchants\nshould take up the matter with the\nPortland wholesalers with whom they\ndeal.\nIt has been proven time after time\nthat the Pacific highway in western\nOregon Is In fine shape and offers\nwonderful scenery and better accom-J\n... ... .n\nmodations to tthe traveler than do\nthe sandy wastes of eastern Oregon.\nWhy Portlanders should send auto\nists around by the longer route is an\nunanswered question. Most of the\ntourists who go by the eastern route\nship their cars to The Dalles or some\nother Columbia river point.\nThe only possible advantage of the\neastern route Is that it goes around\nthe bad place south of Dunsmuir,\nCal., which Is nearly Impassable In\nwet weather. At this time of ther\nyear, however, this piece of road of\nfers no difficulties, autoists coming\nfrom the south proclaiming it to be\nin good shape. At any rate this could\nbe eliminated If necessary in wet\nweather by leaving the Pacific high\nway at Ashland or in northern Cali\nfornia and crossing to the eastern\nroute at Klamath Falls, thus adding a\nfew miles to the trip, but even then\nnot making it as long as the eastern\nOregon route.\nThe Siskiyou mountain grade, once\nthe bugbear of motorists, Is now a\nlooked forward to piece of perfect\nroad with easy grades and beautiful\nscenery. The beauties of the wonder\nful valleys of the Willamette, Ump\nqua and Rogue with the Intervening\nmountain scenery and the unexcelled\nscenic wonders of the Siskiyou moun\ntains, are attractions which will\nstamp lasting impressions of beauti\nful Oregon Into the minds of the tour\nists. Two days of dusty travel in\neastern Oregon will extinguish all re\nmembrance of the beauties of Port\nland and the Columbia river country.\nOrres cleans clothes cleaner than\nany cleaner that cleans clothes clean.\nManager Talks\nTo Club Women\nOn Wednesday afternoon the man\nager of the publicity department met\nwith the members of the Civic Im\nprovement Club and outlined to the\nladies some of his plans for starting\nthe campaign of advertising Ashland\nas a resort city. In connection .with\nthe work of placing Ashland on the\nmap as a great watering place Mr,\nDuryea touched on the need of en\nthusiastic co-operation on the part of\neach and all of the citizens in the\nwork. He said the best advertising\nAshland could have would be to send\nevery visitor away with the Impres\nsion the citizens of Ashland were fair\nly bubbling over with optimistic faith\nin the possibilities and advantages of\ntheir home town. He complimented\nthe ladies on the splendid spirit they\nhad shown in helping to make Ash\nland attractive to the stranger and\nvisitor, and on their energetic Interest\nthis, and every, community of an or\nganization of public spiritted women,\nsuch as their own organization is, ex\npressing and crystallizing In Its force\nful activities the sentiment and desire\nof Its members to serve In every way\nthe best interests of the ctiy. He\nexpressed his desire and purpose to\nhelp the women of the Civic Improve\nment Club In the furtherance of their\nplans for the good of Ashland, when\never he could be of service to them,\nfor he recognized the club as one of\nthe strongest factors in the develop\nment of the city.\nOne of the buildings from the park\nwas hauled through the plaza by a\nsteam roller yesterday. Zenas Moody\npiloted the roller and with the excep\ntion of a little trouble on the corners\nthe trip was made without serious\ntrouble. The building was headed for\na location on the Carson-Smith lum\nber yard property. It Is a storage\nshed from their Mill property. In the\nplaza the building scraped several\nbranches off of one of the trees.\nCafe Elite, where you auto eat.\nThe Billings Hill Problem Will\nBe Settled By County Court\nState Engineer Cantlne, Engineer\nKittredge, Judge Tou Velle and Com\nmissioner Leever, a Medford commit\ntee, and Mayor Johnson and Mr. Ware\non the part of Ashlaud met at the\nBillings hill this morning and went\ncarefully over the situation.\nFor some time it has been a ques\ntion whether the hill would be graded\nout of state funds or by the county\ncourt out of the bond fund. En\ngineer Cantine made iticlear that the\nstate appropriation would be used on\nthe Siskiyou grade from the junction\nof the Pacific highway and the Klam\nath Falls road to the California line.\nTha pAiintv at ill haa a nnrrtYlm a Ipl v\n.,..... . . , .\n$100,000 left out of the bond money,\nincluding $10,000 coming from the\nstate and $7,000 from the railroad\nfor its share of the expense in mak\ning overhead crossings on the Siski-\nBoy of Fourteen\nForges Check\nA certain fourteen-year-old boy,\nwhose name we will refrain from\nmentioning, passed a check on one of\nthe local merchants the first of the\nweek and was hauled up before the\npolice. The boy had secured a num\nber of blank checks and was going\ninto the business. He had obtained\nhis ideas from novels and newspaper\naccounts of forgers and from adver\ntisements of check protectors which\ntold how easy it was to raise and\nforge checks.\nBecause of the extreme youth of\nthe embryo criminal he was not Jailed\nbut Is out on good behavior. This\nshould be a lesson to other youthB\nwho are contemplating quick trips to\nwealth by the check forger\'s route.\nBuy Land on West\nSide of Park Ave.\nThe city council and tfte springs\ncommissloe. are closing a deal for\nproperty on the west side of Park\navenue, formerly known as Mill\nstreet, the property involved extend\ning from the land on which the Park\ngarage stands to the PerozzI property\nadjoining the creamery property. The\nstrip is 314 feet long and extends\nback to the foot of the bluff which\nbacks up onto Granite street. The\nprice paid vill be in the neighborhood\nof $5,900, the city paying $4,900 and\nthe commission $1,000. The property\nis owned by Messrs. Peil. Kinney.\nWheeler, and Susie Allen. The strip\nwill be used partly\'for widening Mill\nstreet and for park purposes.\nAshland Garage\nHas New Owner\nPerry L. Ashcraft, Jr., has taken\nover the Ashland garage at 53 Second\nstreet from H. G. Butterfield and will\nbe glad to see the automobile owners\nof the vicinitv. Mr. Ashcraft has\nestablished a sterling reputation as a\nconscientious automobile man both in\nAshland, where he was formerly in\nbusiness, and In Medford, where he\nconducted the Medford garage. He\nhas always made his motto "The Best\nof Service" and has lived up to it,\nThe Ashland garage has a full equip\nment for all repairs and Mr. Ashcraft\nwill employ expert mechanics., A full\nline of accessories and tires will be\ninstalled. The new owner will con\'\ntinue his valley agency for the Chalm\ners and Studebaker cars and will keep\nhis offices at Medford open.\nNew Cafe Offers\nRefinements\nThe Elite cafe, in Hotel Ashland\nblock, was opened Saturday under\nmanagement of Mesdames Orres and\nMetcalf. There, was an orchestra\nconcert in the evening, refreshments\nbeing served. In connection with the\nestablishment there will be dressing\nand rest rooms, the free use of which\ns available to the public, a circum\nstance to which the attention of the\nout-of-town visitors should be espec\nially called. The ladies are serving\nvery high class meals at exceedingly\nreasonable prices.\nMrs. Belle S. Castleman and daugh\nter are visiting the F. F. Whittle\nhome. Mrs. Castleman Is Mrs. Whit\ntle\'s mother. , - .\nyon prade.\nThree routes are available up the\nBillings hill. The first and most de\nsirable from an engineering stand\npoint Is the one through the Billings\nproperty and under the railroad; the\nsecond around to the right of the hill\nand under the railroad where the\nrailrond now crosses the creek; the\nthird to make a cut on the present\nroad route and a fill of about ten feet\nat the bottom near the Jackson house.\nJudge Tou Velio and Mr. Lecver\nexpressed a willingness to begin the\nwork at once and Engineer Cantine\nagreed to examine into the cost, the\ngrade elevation and the safety feature\nof the three routes and make a rec\nommendation within two weeks. The\nmatter will be ready for consideration\nand final action at the July meeting\nof the county court.\nContracts Let For\nPainting School\n\' The West Side school is to receive\na cont of paint Inside and out. Wat\nson & Rigg were awarded the con\ntract for the painting of the exterior\nand A. R. Chaney the interior. The\ntwo contracts aggregate $600. 1 The\nbuilding was erected in 1904 and\nstands as a monument to the consci\nentious work of the contractors who\nhad the job, as it has not required a\ncoat of paint since until now.\nThe West Side school building and\nthe school grounds form one of the\nmost beautiful of Ashland\'s beauty\nspots. Clinging vines clothe the\nfront of the building and a perfectly\nkept lawn, artistically arranged\nshrubbery and majestic trees com\nplete the effect.\nDisplays Handful\nOf Gold Nuggets\nlajor Carter displayed a double\nbaifvlful of gold nuggets. and\' rotten\nquartz shot full of gold on the streets\none day last week and states that he\nand his pals have struck a vein of it\nfourteen inches wide and traceable\nfor a sufficient distance to make a\nbig mine. It was found with a gran\nite wall on one side and porphyry on\nthe other. It is declared that a gold\nfind under these conditions does not\npinch out. Mr. Carter has taken a\nsack full of the ore to an assayer and\nBtates that interesting announce\nments will be made later. At present\nhe will only say that the mine Is not\ntwo and a half miles from Ashlaud.\nCured By Lithia\nMartin Leaves\nAfter an extended stay In Ashland\nduring which he drank lithia water in\ngreat quantities daily, John D. Martin\nleft yesterday for his home in Lapeer,\nMich., cured of a case of kidney trou\nble which eastern doctors had pro\nnounced incurable. Mr. Martin came\nhere nearly a year ago in very poor\nhealth and began taking the lithia\nwater treatment for his trouble. He\nattributes his wonderful cure to the\nextraordinary medicinal properties of\ntthe lithia water and to keeping up a\nsteady dally consumption of the wa\nter. Mr. Martin Is now an Ashland\nbooster and will spread the story of\nhis cure In his home state.\nWas It Howard or\nPatery, or Both?\nThe marriage of a couple from\nGold Hill at the local Baptist parson\nage, which was reported in last Mon\nday\'s Issue In the form of a clipping\nfrom the Gold Hill News, has some\nqueer crook in it. Either the Gold\nHill paper was at fault or else the\nman wag so scared over the prospect\nof entering matrimony that he gave\nthe wrong name. According to the\nnewspaper the man\'s name was Dr.\nR. E. Howard and according to the\nlicense which was presented to the\nclergyman here It was LeRoy Patery 1\nof Columbus, Ohio. The lady In the\ncase and the witnesses seem to be the\nsame In both Instances.\nThis office was lately the recipient\nof a big glass humidor of fine smok\ning tobacco with the compliments of\n"Velvet Joe." Little favors such as\nthis smooth over many rough places.\nMay Put Motor Cop\nOn Pacific Highway\nThe county court Is considering the\nadvisability of putting on a motorcy\ncle cop to curb Bpeeders and joy-riders\non the Pacific highway, the reck\nless driving undergoing no restriction\nas the result of the tragic event of\nlast Friday morning when a life was\nsnuffed out and two others seriously\ninjured. Fred Dodge of this city re\nported to the authorities that laHt Sat\nurday afternoon a big car passed at\na high rate of speed, just grazing\nhim. He wan unable to get the num\nber. After the sun goes down is\nwhen the reckelss driving reaches its\nheight, and owners of horses have\ncomplained that they have no rights,\nbeing forced to take the sides or be\nrun over.\nMany of the farmers and residents\nalong the Pacific highway have made\ncomplaints to the state authorities\nconcerning auto law violations. All\nsuch violations should be reported to\nthe county officials In case of the vio\nlation occurring on the county roads,\nto city officials if occurring in the\ncities. The following communication\nwas received from the secretary of\nstate concerning the matter:\n"Salem, June 22, 1315.\n"From many sections of the state\nthe attention of this office is repeat\nedly directed to alleged violations of\nthe motor vehicle laws, the impres\nsion prevailing that the secretary of\nstate Is vested with the enforcement\nof the same. Such Is not the case.\nThis office Is not vested with police\npowers. Its duties are only to regis\nter motor vehicles and chauffeurs as\nproper applications are filed.\n"Under this law (Sections 26 and\n27) It Is made the specific duty of\nall police officers, sheriffs and con\nstables, within the limits of their\nrespective Jurisdictions, to enforce its\nprovisions.

All of these organiza\ntions will be asked to file the Inform\nation regarding the camp ground for\nthe benefit of touring motorists from\nother states, who may ask for in\nformation concerning camping facili\nties along the Pacific highway.\nAs soon as the camp ground Is com\npleted photographs of It will be taken\nand used for souvenir cards to pre\nsent to visiting motorists.

This paper is\none of the great London newspapers\nand It Is so different from American\nnewspapers we wish we could send a\ncopy to all our subscribers. The first\npage of the paper is taken up entirely\nwith small advertisements. The first\nnews article in the paper is a two or\nthree column review of the financial\nsituation, then follows columns de\nvoted tg markets. The next page Is\ndevoted entirely to a list of men and\nofficers killed and wounded In battle.\nThe fourth pnge Is devoted to book\nreviews and the fifth page to letters\nto the editor. The sixth page, In this\nsocial center of the world, has a col\numn and a half of society news and\nthen some special reference to the\ndoings of notables. The seventh page\nIs given over to dramatical news and\nthen comes the editorial page. The\nfirst news Item, as Americans regard\nnews ,is printed on the ninth page\nand this is about the war. In fact, all\nof the ninth page, all of the tenth\npage and nearly all of the eleventh\npage is devoted to war news. On the\neleventh page there Is a half-column\nstory about a London street railway\nstrike and some ten or twelve small\nItems of city affairs from three to six\nInches long. The twelfth and thir\nteenth pages are given over to war\nnews. The fourteenth page to art and\nmusic and paid church announce\nments. The fifteenth and sixteenth\npages carry special articles. The\nseventeenth page prints athletics not\n"sportB" as we understand that term\nin America and the back page is de\nvoted to small clasHiried advertise\nments. This completes the copy of\nthe London Sunday Observer. Aside\nfrom the war news there is scarcely\nan article In the paper which would\nnot be as Interesting one day as an\nother. The largest advertisement In\nthe paper Is that ofa real estate firm\ntaking hnlf a page. Tho great bulk\nof the advertising Is small ten and\nfifteen inch ads, largely dealing with\ndry goods and other things ladies buy.\nThe only pictures appearing ih the\npaper outside of illustrations In ad\nvertising are three pertaining to the\nwar.\nWithout saying anything much\nabout it, Uncle Sam\'s little old post\noffice department continues to plug\naway increasing the efficiency of its\nservice, doing more things and doing\nthem better than ever before, and\ndaily confounding the people who say\nthat "everything. can be done better\nby private initiative than by the gov\nernment." Beginning August 1, automobile\nservice for rural free delivery routes\nIn many localities will be authorized\nunder the clause of the resolution of\ncongress of March 3 laBt authorizing\nthe introduction of auto service at\ncompensation not exceeding $1,800 a\nyear. Where the roads are good and\nprospective business justifies it, these\nauto carriers will serve the farmers\non routes not less than fifty miles in\nlength. This improvement Is going\nto permit the further extension of\npresent routes. It means quicker ser\nvice at less cost, and consequently\nmore service for the same coBt. The\nfirst routes will go into operation\nAugust 1.\nAuto service, under the policy of\nthe department, is also to be utilized\ngradually to Install rural routes which\nwill radiate out from the large cities.\nSuburban and rich truck-growing\nareas within twenty-five miles of\ngreat cities, when thus served, will\nget the "local" instead of the "first\nzone" parcel post rate. This means\nreduced cost and the Immediate stim\nulation of local parcel post exchange,\nespecially of Uncle Sam\'s famous\n"Farm to Table" service. Although\nauto routes of this kind will be legal\nly rural routes, the effect of their in\nstallation will be to bring the terri\ntory served within city delivery.\nLEND A HAND.\n"Ashland. Ore., hns sot aside funds\nfor the entertainment of visitors and\nspecial train parties which will stop\nat that point this summer, according\nto Agent George N. Kramer of Ash\nland.

Make a stir!\nSwing the scythe and cut down the\ngrain. Use your hands, binding into\nbundles all that is ready for the gar\nner. Make a stir. If yoi are a mer\nchant, be on the alert; display your\ngoods, attract the people, and In a\nlively way move around them, and\nshojy you are a willing servant, even\nanxious to accommodate In the small\nest matters.

Great Scott, if the\neditor of the average newspaper pub\nlished all that comes to his ears or\nthat he knows has transpired, this\nworld would be a realm of woe and a\nfield of continual combat. A few in\nstances which do receive the atten\ntion of the press are only to serve as\nexamples. The average editor de\nserves praise for not publishing more\nthan he does. The news might be a\nsweet morsel to the degraded minds,\nbut the heart-burnings which would\nbe created by the unfortunate ones\nwould more than offset, and then we\nare not any of us angels.

The man who\nreally has something good is so proud\nof it that you could not keep him\nfrom advertising It.

Conse\nquently the most elaborate precau\ntions are being taken to insure the\nsafe transportation of the priceless\nrelic.\nThe bell will be handled on a spec\nial train. It will be under guard\nevery moment from the time It leaves\nPhiladelphia until it Is returned\nthere. It will be carried on a special\ngondola freight car, equipped with\nal lthe safety appliances necessary to\nenable it to be moved" in a passenger\ntrain. The gondola will occupy the\nsame position as an observation car,\nat the rear of the train, that the resi\ndents of the cities and towns through\nwhich it passes may view the bell.\nThere are six other cars Bleepers,\ndiner, etc. these to be occupied by\nthe exposition dignitaries, Philadel\nphia officials and others making up\nthe escort committee of sixty or sev\nenty persons.\nThe bell will leave Philadelphia on\nJuly 7. Safety of transportation and\nthe population of the country tra\nversed by the railroads determined\nthe routing. It will pass through\nChicago and Kansas City, and thence\nbe transported to Omaha, where it\nwill be taken in charge by the Union\nPacific. The latter road will carry\nIt through Denver and Salt Lake City\nto Ogden, where the Oregon Short\nLine will assume charge tnd take it\nto Boise. From Boise It will go to\nPortland, and after being on exhibi\ntion there six hours the Southern Pa\ncific becomes Its guardian. This will\nbe on July 15. On that day the\nSouthern Pacific will begin Its trans\nportation to San Francisco vit the\nShasta Route, the residents along\nwhich will be given an opportunity\nto view the historical reminder of the\nWar of Independence. The bell will\nleave Portland at noon July 15. It\nwill reach Salem at 2 p. m. of the\nsame day, be on exhibition until\n2:30, and will then be moved to Eu\ngene, arriving there at 5 p. m. The\npeople of Eugene will have 15 min\nutes In which to view it. Arriving at\nRoseburg, it will be on display the\nsame length of time, arriving there\nat 8:15 p. m. 1\nThe axact time of arrival In Ash\nland has not been announced as yet,\nbut will be shortly after midnight.\nPlans are being made for a night cel\nebration to greet the bell.\nOn Friday, July 16, the bell will\nbe in California. It will reach\nMarysville at 12:15 and be on exhibi\ntion 15 minutes. At 2 p. m. it will\nbe in Sacramento, where it will re\nmain for one hour and then be moved\nto Oakland and San Francisco. July\n17 will be Liberty Bell day at the\nexposition and people from every cor\nner of the state are expected to visit\nthe fair on that day.\ni Every precaution will be taken by\nthe Southern Pacific in transferring\nthe bell across the bay from Oakland\nto San Francisco. A special barge\nwill deliver it to the San Francisco\nfreight slip, where a special freight\ncar and switch engine will be waiting\nto take it to Third and Townsend\nstreets. Here it will be placed on\na truck and carried through the\nstreets of the city to the fair grounds.\nThe total mileage covered by the\nLiberty Bell\'s westward journey is\n5,234. The average speed per hour\nwill be 28 miles, the railroads hand\nling the, movement having decided\nthat to haul it faster might endanger\nits safety. The bell already has one\nlarge crack In it. The itinerary for\nthe return movement has not yet been\ndecided upon.\nSix Weeks Will\nDecide Beet Future\nThe next six weeks will tell the\ntale of whether or not the Rogue\nRiver Valley will have a sugar beet\nfactory. C. W. Nlbley, the Salt Lake\ncapitalist who Is the h"ad of Immense\nbeet sugar, lumber and banking in\nterests which represent millions, and\nJoseph Smith, president of the Mor\nman church and Interested In the es\ntablishment of factories, who were in\nthe valley Saturday, state that they\nwill assure the financing of an $S00,\n000 beet factory providing the test\nplantings turn out well and that suf\nficient acreage can be signed up by\nthe farmers.\nThe capitalists were taken through\nthe valley in autoa and were shown\nsamples of the beets grown In the val\nley this year under the direction of\nExpert Storey. According to the vis\nitors\' statements, the local product Is\nalready 50 per cent farther advanced\nthan the beets In their own fields.\nThe party was charmed with the val\nley. "If the beets you have shown us\ntoday maintain the present quality\nsix weeks from now, you can rest as\nsured that a beet sugar factory will\nbe built in southern Oregon. The\nonly thing necessary for you to do is\nto secure the acreage and the farm\ners to raise them. The financing will\nbe taken care of by us. We have\nmade arrangements for that without\nlocal help, bonuses or other strings."\nThis was the statement of Joseph\nSmith, concorded In by C. W. Nibley.\nAt the end of the six weeks those\nwho are Interested in the valley will\nknow for sure what beets will do here,\nand if the report is favorable a rous\ning campaign will be set Into motion\nThe high cost Of getting their cof\nfees to the consumer makes It neces\nsary for the exclusive coffee-house to\ndo one of two things get more for\nthe same quality or turn out a cheap\ner product.
