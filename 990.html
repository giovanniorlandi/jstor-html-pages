Barclay is now Post\nmaster at Kcalla, his appointment\n, having been received last week.\n\' Owing to tho absence of Mr. Lydgato\nnext Sunday, tho regular morning scr\nwill bo replaced by an evening praise\nservice, to which every one is cordially\ninvited.\nThe wholesale price of refined sugar\nthroughout tho United States wont on\na basis of 7.45 cents, less 2 per cent\nat all seaboard refining points plus\nprevailing freight rates to interior\npoints, on January 7th.\nTommy Todd, on duty for Undo\nSam in New York, was recently mar\nried, and wrote homo in great joy\nabout it, but forgot to mention the\nlady\'s name. Ho is a brother of Mrs.\nT. Cunningham, of Llhuc.\nTho Bank of Hawaii is displaying a\nservice flag, with a star to represent\nLieutenant Carden, now at the front.\nHo was formerly a clerk In that bank,\nhut wont to tho officer\'s training camp,\nand earned a commission.\n.The Kcauhou, which was sold to a\nManila firm, to be used in the island\ncopra trade, has reached Manila in\nsafety. She was in command of Cap\ntain Warren Purdy, an island boy who\nhas risen rapidly in the sea-faring pro\nfession. The standing of the various schools\nlu tho Garden Contest on Feb. 21st\nwas as follows: First, Lihue; second,\nWalmea; third, Anahola; fourth,\nKapaa; fifth, Makawell; sixth, Hana\nlei; seventh, Knlahco; eighth, Koloa;\nninth, Wailua; tenth, Haena.\nMr. Christmas has very kindly given\na very beautiful painting of Kancohi\nbay on the windward sido of Oahu, to\nthe Kauai Auxiliary of the Honolulu\nHawaii chapter of tho American Red\nCross. This picture is on exhibition\nat tho Lihue Store and tho proceeds\nfrom it will go to this very necessary\ncause.\nBy special Invitation ttcV. J. M.\nLydgate will participate in the jubilee\nexercises celebrating the GOth anniver\nsary of tho founding of the Hilo First\nForeign Church, which will take place\nin Hilo this coming Sunday. Mr. Lyd\ngate is one of the very few remaining\nearliest members of this historic\nchurch, and will doubtless add much\nto tho interest of tho occasion by his\nreminiscences of those early days of\nhis boyhood.\nTerritorial Fair News.\nHonolulu, Feb. 25 Hawaii\'s exhibits\nof livestock, field crops, fruits and\nvegetables at tho territorial fair, Juno\n10 to lfi, may bo inspected and Judged\nby experts of national repute, detailed\nto Honolulu for the specific purpose\nby the U. S. Bureau of Animal Indus\ntry and U. S. Bureau of Agriculture\nActing on a suggestion from Harold\nW. Itlco, the fair commissioner repre\nsenting the island of Maul, Chairmen\nCeorgo H. Angus has written the De\npartment at Washington requesting\ntheir cooperation and the appointment\nof men for this work.\nIt is believed the Departments will\nbo glad to assign experts, and that the\nshowing which island growers make\nat tho fair will open tho eyes of tho\nmainland visitors and help to give\nHawaii a splendid advertisement in\nthe states.\nIt Is not with a viow of getting ad\nvertisement on tho mainland that the\nexperts are desired, howover. Tho\nfair commission wants tho very best\nadvice for its exhibitors and the Island\ngrowers in general, that is to bo had,\nand tho one sure way to get It Is to\nobtain os judges men known in Ameri\nca as leaders In these industries. Sug\ngestions from such as these will bo\nheard and heeded by local growers.\nThey will bring a spirit of optimism\nand enthusiasm that should prove in\nfectious, resulting In better livestock\nbreeding and more careful, Intelligent\nand intenslvo agriculture by the island\ngrowers.\nThough tho Government\'s agents\nare perhaps more busily occupied now\nthan ever before, becauso of tho vital\nneed for greater food production\nthroughout tho mainland, tho fair is\ninclined to believe two or three can bo\nspared to attend the territorial fair,\nespecially since the Honolulu exhi\nbition is ,to bo held in June, a com\nparatively quiet Bummer month, when\ntho planting of crops in tho states is\nilnished and early harvest has not yet\nstarted.\nA meeting was held at tho Japanese\ndormitory, in Lihue on Friday ovening,\nto celebrate tho anniversary of Wash\nington\'s birthday. Charles F. Loomis\nwas chairman and ho seems to bo an\nadept at that sort of thing. Ho gavo\na short address concerning his recent\ntrip East, and drew a very forclblo\nlesson from the fact that Woolworth\nhad been able to erect a twenty mill\nion dollar building from small profits\nand quick turn-over secured in the\nmanagement of ton and fifteen cent\nstores. Tho speaker then applied tho\nlesson to small savings effected\nthrough the purchase of thrift stamps,\nand spoke of the saving of tho wheat\nwhich had been accomplished through\ntho obscrvancso of wheatless days.\nAlthough tho mooting was announc\ned as an observance of Washington\'s\nbirthday, it seemed more like a beauty\ncontest. For thoro wore wahines u\'l\nnut. And most of them were Indus\ntriously knitting. If all of those girls\nprove as industrious when married,\nsomebody is going to secure real\nhousohold treasures.\nProfessor McCluskuy, principal of\nthe High School, is a handy man. He\nseems to be able to talk on most any\nsubject, with tho utmost freedom and\nerudition. Ho said that instructors\nwere not as a rule, given much to\nspeaking, as it became a part of their\ncalling to seek to draw out the latent\nknowledge in others. Then he went\nahead and spoke as naturally as you\nplease. In referring to George Wash\nington, ho said that there were three\nprerequisites to success, equipment,\nopportunity, and courage. He pro\nceeded to show that Washington pos\nsessed all of theso.\nJudge Dickey spoko of Washington"\nin a very complimentary manner, and\nmade an Interesting address.\nL. A. Walworth, the new assistant\nsecretary of tho Y. M. C. A. for Kauai,\nwas called on to givo a resume of his\nwork and experience in the Y. M. C. A.\nand said:\n"1 first becamo identified with Y. M.\nC. A. work through tho activities of\nan auxiliary society called tho Acoma,\nwhich had been formed by students\nof the Kansas University. I had yearB\nbefore decided to make the Y. M. C. A,\nmy life work, and hero was my first\nchance to enter into active participa\ntion. Every June tho students of that\nuniversity went to Estes Park, in Col\norado, every summer. After confer\nence, during tho trouble with Mexico, I\nwas appointed one of three secretaries,\nand was detailed to duty at Riflo\nRange, a military camp situated bo\ntween Denver and Golden City.\nAfter that, I becamo connected with\ntho work in Pueblo, In a railroad Y. M.\nC. A., which had just been organized.\nPueblo is not a very largo city, and\nI felt that I could accomplish more\nby removing to some larger commer\ncial center. So I went to San Francis\nco. Not being able to secure Y. M.\nC. A. work immediately, I went to\nwork at my trade In the Union Iron\nWorks as a ship caulker.\nLast September there" arose a de\nmand for an increased number of sec\nretaries, and I left, my position, where\nI was getting seven dollars a day, to\naccept a little more than half as much\nas an assistant at Oakland. There Mr.\nLoomis heard of me, and made me an\noffer to come to Kauai. I am glad I\ncame, and have acquired a lively in\nterest in the wgrk here, and feel that\nI will succeed. Mrs. Walworth and her\nmother came with mo as far as Hono\nlulu, where they remained to visit ac\nquaintances for a week or so. When\ntho house I expect to occupy is ready,\nthey will come to Llhuc. As soon as\nthe new residence for Mr. McCluskey\nis completed, I expect to occupy tho\ndwelling which will thus bo made va\ncant. My oflico will bo in the building\nin front of tho Court House, which\nwas formerly ocupled by Mr. McDan\niels." Miss Cates spoke very enter\ntainingly, and her address was voted\nto bo the best one of the ovening.\nA vote was taken to seo who was\nconsidered tho most popular man,\nWashington, Lincoln or President Wil\nson. Washington received eight votes,\nWilson fourteen, and Lincoln twenty\nfour.

All store keepers on tho lsl\nand, therefore, have been Invited to\nmeet at the Court House in Lihue\nnext Saturday, tho 2d, by Food Com\nmissioner Caso, who will at that time\nexplain the matter thoroughly. Ho de\nsires to have it understood that the\ninvitation is extended to all store keep\ners, of whatever nationality.\nA Two Star Service Flag\nAt the Lihuo Union Church on Sun\nday a now Service Flag with two stars\nwas displayed for the first time. This\nflag is memorial of Miss Mabel Wilcox\nand Mr. C. S. Dole, members of the\nchurch now under orders at tho front\nor on the way to it.\nA committee was appointed to ex\npress to these, our representatives,\nour pride in their service, and our\nsympathy and regard for them. It has\nalso been suggested that some articlo\nof useful equipment might bo made\nby the church members and forward\ned to them.\nLihue Hotel Crowded\nThe Hotel Lihue has been pretty\nwell filled, lately. Last night so many\ncame over from Honolulu that every\nroom in the house was occupied, and a\nfew regular customers urose at 3 to\nallow the travellers who had been up\nall night on the boat to have a little\nrest. The recent arrivals includo J.\nTwombly, of San Francisco; Allan\nDooue, Sydney, Australia; J. W. Leh-\nwes, New York; Misses Getta F. Smith\nand Marjorie F. Smith, Boston; W.

A.\nWalworth, Oakland, and Mrs. C. E.\nHazelrigg, of Kansas City.\nMoving Picture Stunts\nThe world is not so very large,\nafter all. It is always interesting to\nnote tho side remarks indulged In by\nattendants concerning tho films being\nshown. There aro a few residents\nhero who havo travoled largely. Such\nexclamations as ".Why, that is Grif\nfiths Park, sure as you live Just off\nthe Hollywood road, don\'t you know,\nas you start up tho grade leading up\nover tho summit and down toward\nGlendale. And don\'t you remember\nthat cow-boy scene tho other night\nwhen the little depot at Troplco was\nshown?" "Yes, and don\'t you know\nwo saw one of tho trails in tho park\nonly a few nights ago? And tho can\nyon just above Santa Monica?" "Yes,\nand remembor that sycamoro tree\nwhere tho girl and her fellow were\nsitting oh tho peculiarly crooked\nbranches? I know right where it is\nJust on the edge of tho little dry creek\njust before you get to Santa Monica."\n"Why, .that\'s Marblehead, sure as\nyou live. I havo walked out on that\npoint many times, whoro Mary Pick\nford stands. And you know that old\nboat they showed awhile ago? Well,\nthat was going right over North to\nward the rocky Island where tho big\nhotel used to bo."\n"Yes, and don\'t you remember that\nbig scene a few weHjks ago when there\nwere so many soldiers riding at break\nneck speed? That was out at Universal\nCity. I remember that hill as well as\ncan bo."\n"Yes, and don\'t you romomber that\nConey Island scene? Ami the Hearst\nnews pictorials show places whero I\nhave traveled."\nSome of tho night scenes of traveling\ntrains, shown recently, exhibited some\nvery ingenious photographic work, and\nboiuo very attractive views, as well.\nAnd many of tho horseback riding\nstunts, where the riders fall off, seem\nto involve some very daring stunts.\nFor, notwithstanding that films are\noften pieced, and other sections in\ntroduced where dummies aro made\nto play an Important part, there aro\nmany scenes which are genuine, and\nprocured only by the exhibition of the\ngreatest daring upon the part of rldors.\n:o:\nThey do say that Spitz sold sixteen\nFords, this week. Ono customer ar\ngued that he was in a hole, and could\nn\'t afford to buy, Just yet. "Well,"\nsaid Spitz, you never got into a hole\nyet that the Ford wouldn\'t pull you\nout of." Spitz sold the car.\nBorn, to Mr. and Mrs. D. W. Dean,\nFobruary 21, 1918, a son, William Mel\nvln Dean,\nSampan Wreck\nDuring tho storm last Tuesday morn\ning as tho Ktnau was proceeding to\nKoloa from Nawlllwlll, when off Ki\npukal, Captain Gregory spied a Japan\nese sampan, which seemed to be In\ndistress. Upon closor examination\nit was seen that the boat was just\nabout swamped. Captain Gregory took\nthe Japanese aboard and proceeded\non his way. The sampan later washed\nup on tho beach, and was wrecked.\nTho fishermen of Kipiku arc salvag\ning the engine.\nChildren\'s Evening\nThe senior mombcrs of the Lihuo\nUnion Sunday School lu I a very\nhappy time at the home of Mr. and\nMrs. J. M. Lydgate on Saturday even\ning last. Following a devotional study\nof the character of Lincoln, they\nplayed games of various kinds, now\nand old, with much enthusiasm and\nenjoyment. But the most successful\nfeature of the evening was the acting\nout of original charades, some of them\nvery ingenious, and many of them\nexcellent local hits. Among tho best\nwere Catskill, Ingratiate, Red Cross,\nand the Garden Island. A little at sea\nat first, tho chldren caught on with\nsurprising facility, and soon became\nvery ready both In originating and\nworking out the charades.\nSchools Honor Washington\nWashington\'s Birthday was prettily\nobserved at the Lihuo Public Schools\non Thursday afternoon. In default of\na suitable assembly room, the exer\ncises wero given on the lawn of the\nopen court between tho buildings in\nspite of tho very uncertain weather\nwhich threatened rain at any moment.\nRecitations, some very graceful folk\ndances, motion songs by the little\nones, part recitations illustrative of\nthe lives of some of our groat national\nheroes, the adventures of a little red\nstamp, etc. The singing by tho upper\ngrades In chorus was very well done,\nand vory effective.\nPerhaps on the whole, tho most\npleasing number on the program was\ntho folk dance, "Reaping tho Flax",\nwith a very taking interlude motif.\nTho program was finally hurried to\na close by the down-pour of rain\nwhich fell in sheets, and which ma\nrooned tho audience for an hour or\nso, and placed a vory temporary prem\nium on umbrellas.\nPhysical Examinations\nAll Class I men have been Instructed\nto go to tho postofllce to socure the\nnotices which havo been forwarded to\nthem summoning them to appear be\nfore the various local boards for\nphysical examination on March 2nd.\nTho National Guard were examined\nlast Saturday and Sunday.

In case of dis\nabilities which may seom to disqualify\nthorn, they aro to be examined later\nby government physicians.\nSomowhcro between six and seven\nhundred men of Class I will probably\nbe called from Kauai, In addition to\nthose of the National Guard. Tho\nindications aro now that tho National\nGuard will bo called out first. The\nofficials are so secretive that news\npaper men uro compelled to guess,\nupon many points.\nT. Cunningham, S. E. Lucas, and C.\nYapp, homesteaders at Kapaa, have\npurchased a twenty-horso power cat\nerpillar tractor of tho Yuba type. It\narrived Saturday, and the owners will\ncommence to plow with it at once in\npreparation for tho planting of a crop\nof cane.\nCaptain Robert Lawson, the oldest\nship master In the Pacific, in active\nservice, died two weeks ago in New\nYork, of-pneumonla. He was for fifty\nyears in command of tho schooner\nFair Oaks, and was a frequent visitor\nto island porta.\nFor duty in connection with physical\nexamination of draft registrants on\ntho sovoral islands of tho group, Gen.\nWisser has appointed Captains Albert\nV. Heunessy, Arthur J. Makley, and\nJosoph P. Cleary, of the Medical Re\nsorvo Corps. They will constitute a\nmedical travelling board, and will ac\ncompany Major Charles B. Cooper, as\nsigned to tho selective draft work, on\na tour of Kauai, Maul and Hawaii.\nWest Side Red Cross Unit\nThe Western Kauai Red Cross unit\nprints this resume to give their work\ners an idea of what they havo accom\nplished In tho three months ending\nJanuary 31st. Tho work has doublod\nduring the month of Fobruary, and\nmore woolen garmonts could have\nbeen knitted, had Honolulu boon able\nto supply tho wool. Surgical work\nhas just been taken up. This class of\nwork could not be taken up sooner\nbecause headquarters could not supply\ntho units already engaged along that\nlino. Tho surgical dressing afternoon\nwill be held after thi3 at the home of\nMrs. Eric Knudsen; at Kekaha, on\neach Friday, beginning at 9 a. m., and\ncontinuing all day.

K. IIOOTIIUY . .\nKKNNHTH C. UOPPKU\nTUESDAY\nOPPORTUNITY L1NGERETH STILL\nIsland people haven\'t lived up to\ntheir opportunities. Itoi-aiiHe the cli\nmate and the Boil are eminently\nmilted to tho growth of sugar enne,\nthat has become tho principal Indus\ntry, while with a climate like this,\nand soil like this, and rainfall greater\nby far than the average In any state\non the mainland, the list of products\ncould and should Include nearly every\nthing produced In the United States.\nFor some products, tho market Is\nnaturally limited. For pineapples a\nready market is offered, as there are\ncanned pineapples Is today far greater\nthan the supply. Once In tho can, the\nfruit is Imperishable. Again, tho area\nupon which pineapples can be sucess\nfully grown Is limited to tropical cli\nmates. And both soil and climate are\nsuitable on Kauai.\nCoil (Tee Is grown so extensively and\nproduced so cheaply in South America,\nthat Hawaii cannot successfully com\npete on a commercial scale. Hut con\nsidering that the conditions for Its cul\nture are so favorable, and the flavor of\nisland cofioe so delightful, there Is no\nreason why every farmer on Kauai\nshould not plant an acre or two.\nAt this time, tho awa root la com\nmanding a big price, and Its culture Is\nquite profitable.\nKice is now selling at seven dollars\na bag, and at that rate, there are very\nfew crops indeed, which can be grown\nmore profitably.\nAs a rule, the pioneers in an Indus\ntry to which a land Is peculiarly suited\nhave a chance to reap a big profit be\nfore the business becomes overdone.\nAnd on Kauai, beyond a doubt, new In\ndustries will be introduced.\nThere is no business connected with\nfanning life which at this time offers\nmore profit than the raising of the\nlarger breeds of hogs.\nThe production of eggs can hardly\nbo overdone, and the price is always\nhigher than on the mainland, year in\nand year out. The large foreign pop\nulation makes the demand for ducks\nquite constant.\nLobsters, esteemed a great delicacy\nin the Eastern States, do not seem to\nthrive on the Pacific Coast, where they\nwere transplanted some years \'ago.\nThis is probably because the food to\nwhich they are accustomed is not plen\ntiful. Whether they would thrive in\nthe warmer waters which sm round the\nislands, remains to be seen. But their\nintroduction should at least be attempt\ned. The eastern oyster was many years\nago introduced on the Pacific Coast,\nand thrives there. With so many riv\ners emptying into the sea the waters\nof which are so heavily freighted with\nwith animal and vegetable life from\nmountain and moor, it would seem that\noysters planted along the mouths of\nthe rivers, should laugh and grow fat.\nThe Oregon quahog clam would thrive,\nbeyond a doubt.\nThere would seem to be no good rea\nson why raspberries and blackberries\nshould not be introduced. They should\ngrow on any part of the island, though\nthe higher mountain altitudes, where\nrainfall is especially plentiful, would\nseem to be the ideal location for them.\nConditions on the mainland have for\nyears been such that the man who did\nnot complain that the railroad compan\nies were thieves and robbers, was not\nconsidered loyal. Then the govern\nment took over the railroads but didn\'t\nreilie the rates for either fare or\nfreight. In fact, price fixing along\nnearly all lines of trade taken over by\nthe government have shown an in\ncrease, rather than a decrease. The\ngovernment has been prosecuting the\nrailroads for years because they do\nsired and attempted to centralize pow\ner and management by combinations.\nYet one of the first things the govern\nment did was to form combinations\nand pools looking to greater economy\nand greater etliciency. As a whole,\nthe commercial world has been bene\nfited, instead of injured, by govern\nment control. Every railroad, every\nsteamship line, every manufacturer of\nany kind of goods which has been\ntaken over, has profited largely. One\ndoes not have to look very far to see\nillustrations of this fact. The Amor!\ncan-Hawaiian Steamship Company is\namong the incorporations the income\nof which has been materially in\ncreased. The steamers which have\nbeen lost by the government will be\nby the government replaced. The Mat\nson Company has also benefited large\nly.\nSome of the food conservationists\nare so particular that if a man has\na sweet tooth, they want him to pull It\nThey would even deny a man the priv\nilege of having a sweetheart. And Sis\nter Susie is sewing so many silken\nshirts for Sammies that a man will\nhave to go to the front pretty soon\nto get a decent shirt, or wear one of\nthe sport shirts which had such a\nshort spurt.\n. . . Editor\n.Managing Editor\nFEB. 20\nLIRE OF THE ISLANDS\nMrs. E. V. Swing, of Cleveland, Ohio,\ndoesn\'t seem to believe that there are\njust as good fish In the sea as ever\nhave been caught. She has written to\nGovernor Plnkham, stating that her\nhusband has disappeared, and that she\nbelieves he is In Hawaii. She says\nthat If the Governor can And him, she\nw ill gladly send the money to pay his\nfare home. She says ho has been\nreading literature about the islands,\nand has often expressed a desire to see\nthorn. He left Akron, Ohio, last May,\nand forgot to mention where he was\ngoing. And ho has neglected to write\nto his own llttlo wife. Some say the\nmail is more reliable than the female,\nwhen It comes to corresponding. But\nhere is a man who is so entranced\nby tho scenery that he forgets to write.\nShe says she fears her husband has\nfound a neater, sweeter maiden, In a\ncleaner, greener land.\nIt would bo quite interesting to\nlearn who was the author of the at\ntractive literature he has been read\ning. Surely it was not the old red and\nblue and green pamphlet, which the\nPromotion Committee used to send\nout. The little paragraph by Mark\nTwain about the lure of the islands\nIs good, and will never lose its charm.\nThe stuff Mark Twain wrote in his\nbook "Roughing It," about the islands,\nare so unreasonable that if a man has\nwas libelous to the last degree.\nThe printing and publishing of the\nlittle Daily Wireless has been from the\nfirst an unprofitable venture, upon our\npart, and it will, therefore, be discon\ntinued at the end of the present\nmonth.\nIn the first place, the cost of send\ning the messages from Honolulu are\nnecessarily high, and the government\nhas already forbidden the further\nsending of commercial messages from\nthe coast. The gathering and wording\nof the messages by our agent in Hono\nlulu naturally adding something to the\ncost. The delivery of the paper along\nthe route, which, counting the side\ndetours, amounted to eighty miles a\nday, called for the employment of a\nchauffeur. The wear and tear on the\nauto was an item of no Bmall import\nance. The setting of the type con\nsumed considerable time and Involved\nno inconsiderable expense, and taken\naltogether, the expenses were far In\nadvance of the income.\nA few have patronized the little daly\nvery liberally, and all have paid\npromptly. To them we feel grateful,\nand regret that we could not see our\nway clear to countinue It.\nThe suspension of the little daily\nwill enable us to concentrate our atten\ntion upon the Garden Island, and we\nhope to thereby make the paper much\nmore valuable, not only to subscribers,\nbut to our advertisers, as well.\nProfessor Vaughton McCarthy has\npublished In the American Journal of\nBotany, of New York, a detailed state\nment of the plant life, forests, and\nmountain vegetation of the Manoa\nValley, and ridges surrounding. He\nconcludes from his studies that the\nHawaiian Islands were at some time\nin the past all connected by strips of\nland. This conclusion. It will be\nnoted, does not coincide with that\nreached by geologists, who, with one\naccord, declare that Kauai is much\nolder than any other island of the\ngroup. Perhaps thousands of years\nolder. The latter theory seems very\nreasonable, inasmuch as the lava on\nKauai has been very largely reduced\nto its constituent elements, while the\nlava on other islands in man\' instan\nces still remains practically in its\nprimitive condition.\n"There shall be earthquakes in di\nverse places. There shall be wars\nand rumors of wars. Men shall have\nItching palms. Knowledge shall be\nincreased and men shall seek out\nmany inventions. Chariots shall jostle\ntogether in the streets; they shall ryn\nlike lightning. There shall be distress\nof nations such as the world has never\nseen. No man knoweth of the day nor\nthe hour; but even as when the fig\ntree putteth forth her buds ye know\nthat spring is nigh, so the wise shall\nunderstand. As in the days of Noah,\nwhen he was building the ark. and\nmen were marrying and giving in\nmarriage, so shall it be in the latter\ndays." Are we all blind? Is this the\nbeginning of the end? There are none\nso blind as those who will not see.\nKussia doesn\'t seem to know wheth\ner she wants to fight with Germany or\nAllies. The fact seems to be that the\nmajority of the Russians are in favor\nof peace and want the rich to divide\ntheir wealth with the poor. But liber\nty is more than so-called socialism,\nand Russia must learn that before her\npeople can be either happy or prosperous.\nKAUAI FOR BEAUTIFUL PICTURES\nThe Lanky Company, which took a\nseries of films at Kalapuna, on Hawaii\na few months ago, is coming to the\nIslands again shortly to stage Beveral\nof the Island productions, and to take\nother moving pictures. The company\ntook some very fine views of the palm\nstrewn beaches of the Kalapana sect\nion, and of the volcano and adjacent\nlava tubes. Hut be It known that Kauai\nthe Garden Island, has the most beau\ntiful views of the group. The Lasky\nCompany could get tome very grand\nviews of the Olekcle canyon, the liana\npepo canyon, the cocoa groves at the\nmouth of the Wailua, and the scenery\nat Hanalei. We have on Kauai the\nmost beautiful groves of cocoas, the\ngrandest and most rugged canyons,\nand the most beautiful scenery that\ncan be found anywhere. And the cloud\neffects are unapproached for beauty.\nTho Lasky Company went to Hawaii\nbecause the business men of that isl\nand employ Do Vis Norton to repre\nsent their Interests in Honolulu. He\nnaturally got hold of the Lasky Com\npany\'s manager and steered him over\nto Hawaii. We all admit that Hawaii\nhas many charms, chief of which is the\nvolcano. And we must give them\ncredit for advertising their attract\nions and securing the tourist trafilc.\nHut what Is the matter with Kauai?\nAre we going to sit Idly by and see\nHawaii get all the trade?\nMajor Harold M. Clark, the army\naviator, In charge of the aviation camp\non Oahu, announces that he will, with\nin a few weeks, make flights to Maui,\nKauai, and poslbly Hawaii. He has al\nready flown to Molokal and return.\nHe Bays he is especially desirous of\nflying ovev Kalaupapa, to give the\npatients there an opportunity to see\nan aeroplane. The seaplane which is\nused by Major Clark, is one of the\nbest the army uses, and can easily\nfly the channels, but it must alight\non water, and the Major baa been vis\niting Maui and Hawaii to see where\nhe will have to alight. He will prob\nably come to Kauai for a similar pur\npose shortly, as he has already an\nnounced that he intends to make a\nflight to this island.\nThe Advertiser\'s Washington corres\npondent wires that Secretary Baker\nhas decided to issue a war department\norder placing Oahu on the dry list.\nThe Judge Advocate General has de\ncided that the island of Oahu is prop\nerly classifiable as a training camp.\nThat sounds pretty good, but nothing\nworks half so well as a government\norder issued and in full operation.\nIs the Secretary afraid of the liquor\nelement? Prohibition Is coming,\nwhether Hawaii wants it or not. Ex\nperience has proven that it will benefit\nthe people as a whole, and the govern\nment Is planning to introduce it. One\nand all, we may as well admit that pro\nhibition is coming, and make up our\nminds to accept it with a good grace.\nLeather is so scarce in England, that\nGreat Britain is planning to limit the\nheight of women\'s shoes. Cotton and\na few other materials from which wo\nmen\'s dresses are manufactured are\nnow not only quite scarce, but the\ngovernment needs all the cotton\nfor the manufacture of munitions. It\nis to be hoped, however, that Great\nBritain will not cut any more material\nfrom the bottom of women\'s skirts.\nThe cabinet spokesman announces\nthat \'It has been decided to issue an\norder prohibiting the manufacture of\nboots for women with uppers of more\nthan a specified height." A law lim\niting the use of the English language\nto those who are skilled in the use of\nit might be of service to some.\nHilo should naturally expect to be\nstruck by lightning, once In a while,\nthough such a thing has never hap\npened until the 16th of this month,\nwhen the government oil warehouse,\nsituated opposite Cocoanut Island, was\nstruck. Its contents Included 450 cases\nof kerosene, and 250 cases of gasoline.\nThe fire was unquenchable, and burned\nall night, so that only the four walls\nremained standing in the morning. In\nasmuch as no other Hilo building has\nbeen struck by lightning during the\npast two hundred years or more, it\ndoes not seem impossible that German\nsympathizer was Involved. There are\nother warehouses in Hilo, but only the\ngovernment property was burned.\nThe unexampled rise of the lava in\nthe Kilauea pit has reached a point\nwhere the display is beyond descrip\ntion. There are several thousand\nacres of cold lava in the ancient\ncrater, and the surging lava has\nstarted to overflow this large area.\nNew blow holes have developed in the\nlava which has been cold for many\nyears, and no one can fortell what\ndevelopments may now take place.\nBut it is surely one of the grandest,\none of the most awe-inspiring sights\nin the world, and really worth a trip\naround the world to behold.\nThere is no good reason why elk\nshould not be introduced In the sum\nmits of the mountains, as they would\nhave an abundance of food in that\nlocality, with no temptation to descend\nto the valley.\nThe United States has for many\nyears been negligent concerning her\nmerchant marine, and has persistently\nrefused to subsidize steamers running\nto foreign ports. Other governments,\nmore particularly Japan, have encour\naged in every way their steamers\nwhich were developing trade with oth\ner lands. As a result, the Toyo Klscn\nKalsen built up a profitable business\nbetween the Orient and the Occident.\nAmerican ship owners were thereby\nplaced at a distinct disadvantage. It\nrequired a world war toforce upon the\nminds of our congresmen the necessity\nfor the upbuilding of our merchant\nmarine. With a view of protecting\nter to engage in coastwise business,\ncoastwise shipping, laws were passed\nforbidding vesels under foreign regis\nNow it becomes necesary for the Uni\nted States to suspend the coastwise\nlaws in order to secure sufficient ac\ncommodation for the ordinary travel.\nResidents of the islands will welcome\nthe recent arangement with the Japan\nese company whereby passengers will\nbe permitted to patronize that line be\ntween Honolulu and the Coast with\nout being penalized therefor.\nMayor Dahlmann, of Omaha, was\nformerly an ardent lecturer against\nprohibition. He argued that if the sa\nloons were closed, many people would\nbe thrown out of employment, and\nthere would be many empty houses.\nBilly Sunday preached in Omaha eight\nweeks, and he is the most successful\nbooze fighter that ever happened. As\na result of his campaign, the people\nvoted for prohibition. But the city\ndidn\'t go into bankruptcy, and the\nmayor admits that prohibition has not\nresulted as he expected it to, at all.\nOn the other hand, he says, there are\nnow no unemployed people, that every\nbody Is happier and more prosperous\nand that the bank deposits have in\ncreased, while crime has decreased,\nand the jails are almost empty. Mayor\nDahlmann is now heartily in favor of\nprohibition. He ought to come down\nto Honolulu, and tell them what he\nthinks of prohibition.\nHonolulu dealers are already adver\ntising grape juice for sale in antici\npation of the coming of prohibition.\nCalifornia wine growers will probably\nbe enabled to manufacture grape juice\ninstead of wine, after prohibition shall\nhave come into force in that state.\nJudging by the amount of liquor which\nhas been consumed in Honolulu, the\nCalifornia vineyardlsts will be enabled\n(o sell their entire crop of grape juice\nin that place.\nKing George has assured the women\nof Great Britain that woman suffrage\none of the government\'s well defined\npolicies, and will be one of the first\nmeasures, to be taken up "after the\nwar. If either King George or the\ngovernment were desperately In earn\nest, about that thing, they wouldn\'t\ntalk about waiting until after the war.\nThey would do it now. They all admit\nthat the women deserve recognition,\nbut they are too cowardly to act In\naccordance with their principles.\nLieutenant George T. Armltage, who\nwas a member of the Honolulu Star\nBulletin\'s staff until last July, when he\nleft to join the army, received his com\nmission as an officer at the Presidio\nin November. He was recently mar\nried to Miss Louise Webber, of Bill\nings, Montana. All married men know\nwhat war Is, and we expect Armltage\nto hold his own, wherever he Is.\nA land which has been conquered\nunjustly, is unconquered still. Alsace-\nLorraine has been a thorn in the side\nof Germany since the day when it was\nwrested from France. Germany is now\ndemanding as the price of peace with\nRussia, Poland, Courland, Lithuania,\nEsthonia, and Livonia. She has cap\ntured several of these already.1 and if\nshe secures the remainder of them,\nshe will have another thorn to contend\nwith.\nThe Canadian government announ\nces that the extension of the franchise\nto women is now a part of the govern\nment\'s well established policy, and\nthat suffrage will be favored at the\ncoming elections. That the women\nwill uphold better men and better poli\ncies than the men have. Is a foregone\nconclusion.\nIf sweets for the sweet, why not\nfairs for the fair? Kauai has them, all\nright, but it would be necessary for\nthe superintendent of public Instruc\ntion to declare a vacation, so that\nthese pretty schoolma\'ams could at\ntend. Paper trousers are now being used j\nin Berlin. That may work all right\nunter den linden, but it wouldn\'t be j\njust the proper caper on Kauai, where\nthe clouds weep and are never weary.\nWell.

That means that\nthe Governor will be taken over March\n1st, and the President on March 8th,\nthe respective dates upon which they\nwill reach San Francisco. Both will\nbe used as troop ships In the Atlantic.\nIn the place of the two big steamers\nwill be sent the steamer Sachem, a\nvessel of only thousand tons, with pass\nsenger accommodations for only forty\npersons. Two additional freight\nsteamers will be placed on the route\nfrom the islands to San Francisco. The\nLurline and the Manoa will continue\nto carry coastwise passengers, as will\nthe SOnoma, Sierra and Ventura.\nSo;ne of these will undoubtedly be\nwithdrawn later, as it is now stated\nthat the remainder of the Inter-Island\nsteamers will also be taken over.\nHonolulu shipping men believe that\nby the first of March there will be\ncalling at that port no American own\ned steamers, now engaged In the coast\nwise trade either along the Pacific\nCoast, between the mainland and Ha\nwaii, or in the Pacific Coast and South\nAmerican trade, of over 2500 tons dead\nweight carrying capacity.\nAs Hawaii is mostly served by coast\nwise shipping, it is almost certain that\nall the larger steamers now In this\ntrade will be taken over by the gov\nernment and diverted to the govern\nment use In the Atlantic.\nIf this is done Honolulu, Kahulul\nand Hilo will lose the remainder of the\nMatson Navigation Company fleet In\ncluding the two Pacific Coast steamers\nPresident and Governor, which were\nturned over to this steamship company\nafter the Matsonia, Wilhelmina and\nMaui, the biggest ships of the fleet,\'\nwere taken by the government a few\nmonths ago.\nIs America Saying?\nOn all sides one hears talk of house\nhold economy, and thrift in every\naspect of dally life. It is interesting\nto learn just what is being accomplish\ned along these lines, and an article by\nLucy Oppen in the February Good\nHousekeeping Is particularly illumi\nnating. She says:\n\'The first factor which would lead\nus to expect an increase is the fact\nthat home gardens, the increased use\nof perishable foodstuffs, and the in\ncreased amount of home canning con\ntributed very materially to the kitchen\nrefuse of 1917. The second factor,\nwhich would lead us to expect an in\ncrease Instead of a decrease this year\nIs the fact that In practically every\nbutcher shop in the country, the scraps\nof fat and bones, which were formerly\nthrown under the counter to be sold\nto rendering companies, are now\npushed off to the customer. Figures\nfrom the rendering companies which\nused to buy these scraps show that\nthe housewife is now doing her own\nrendering.\n\'Under these conditions, the report\nthat the quantity of garbage collected\nduring the first nine months of 1917\nIn eighty-one cities showed a decrease\nof twelve to fifteen per cent, over the\ncollections of 1916 is nothing short of\nmarvelous. Translated, this means\nthat the housekeeper who used to put\nseven, or eight pounds of material into\nher garbage pail every week has riot\nadded a pound or two, as might be ex\npected, on account of her larger use\nof perishable foodstuffs and butcher\'s\nscraps. Instead she has actually with\nheld one pound out of every seven or\neight which use to go into the can,\nand has exercised her culinary skill\nto put It into the soup kettle or baking-\npan."\nLOCAL RECIPES\nBanana Bread\nMrs. Grelg.\n6 bananas baked in skins, 1 cup rye\nflour, 1 tbls. shortening, 1 tbla. sugar\nor syrup, salt, 1 cup yeast, 1 cup\nwater, white flour to right consistency.\nGraham Loaf\nMrs. Hopper\n2 cups graham flour, 4 level tsps.\nbaking powder, 1 tap. salt.

Drop\nwith spoon on greased pan and bake.\nMakes two dozen cookies.\nThe Government has taken control\nof the manufacture of all by-products\nof the sugar business. This includes\nthe production and distribution of mo\nlasses and beet pulp. It will result in\nthe suspension of the use of waste mo\nlassess tor the manufacture of alcohol\nother than the denatured product.\nFood Conservation Notes\nSubstitutes for Wheat Flour.\nThe Flour Regulations of the United\nStates Food Commission, as they affect\nthe consumer, rule that In purchasing\nwheat flour the consumer must at the\nsame time buy an equal weight of\nother cereals. For instance, when you\nbuy ten pounds or flour you must at\nthe same time buy ten pounds of sub\nstitutes for flour.\nPresident Wilson In his proclama\ntion has named the following substi\ntutes: Barley Flour, Corn Flour, Rice\nFlour, Corn Starch Flour, Corn Meal,\nHominy, Corn Grits, Rice, Oatmeal,\nRolled Oats, Buckwheat Flour, Potato\nFlour, Sweet Potato Flour, Soy Bean\nFlour, and Feterlta Flours and Meals.\nGraham and whole wheat flours are\nwheat products and must be bought as\nsuch, but substitutes of only 30 percent\nare necessary. In other words, seven\npounds of graham or whole wheat\nflour requires only three pounds of\nother cereal substitutes.\'\nRye flour and meal are classed as\nwheat\' products but can be bought\nstraight without substitutes.\nIn ordering substitutes for wheat\nflour, the local Food AdminiBtrutlon\nwould like everyone as much as pos\nsible to order other substitutes than\nrice, such as Corn Meal and Corn\nFlour, which encourages the use of\nhome-grown products, and moreover\nthese articles are cheaper.\nHousewife\'s List.\nOn wheatless days you are allowed\nthe so-called Quick or Baking-powder\nbreads, which are made without wheat\nflour or merely a trace of wheat flour\nis a binder to hold the bread together.\nCorn should be widely used. Barley\nflour may be used. Rye is no longer\nallowed.\nYou are NOT allowed Crackers, Past-\nery, Macaroni, Wheat Breakfast Foods.\nWhite Breads, Rye Bread or Graham\nBread.\nCorn Meal Yeast Bread.\nFor 3 loaves take 3 tbls. corn meal,\nboil it in one pint water till soft, mash\nand strain, and use the water the meal\nhas been boiled in as part of the\nliquid.

The\nlayers of canvas in the . casings are\nthus overtaxed, and little by little\nthey reach the breaking point. He\nsays that brakes should be applied\ngently, and unless it is absolutely nec-\neccary to pull up your car within a\nshort distance, the car should be stop\'\nped as gradually as possible.\nAnother important point in driving\nis the proper manipulation of the\nclutch. In starting never slip in the\nclutch suddenly, with a jerk, but do it\nquietly and easily, in this way protect\ning the mechanism of the c rar as well\nas the tires. Corners should always\nbe taken carefully, at reduced speed,\nregulating the speed to round the turn\nwith little or no use of brakes.\nAs a last word, it Ehould always be\nremembered that tires are rubber, and\ncanvas, and not steel, and that to get\nthe maximum service, the tires should\nbe treated carefully.\nSUBSTITUTES FOR A\nLOAF OF BREAD\n6 or 7 Sweet Potatoes\n13 Irish Potatoes\n1 and 3-5 cups Rice\n4 cups Rolled Oats\n2 cups Hominy\n3 Corn Meal Muffins\n2 and 1-5 cups Corn Meal Mush (un\ncooked )\n14 Corn Meal Griddle Cakes\n1 cup Indian Pudding (M-cup COm\nmeal. 4 cups milk)\n9 Oatmeal Cookies (3 inches In di\nameter)\n18 Peanut Cookies (2 inches in\ndiameter)\nEach of these amounts will give the\nsame amount of energy as a loaf of\nbread.\n: o:\nFort and Merchant Sts.\nHonolulu\nMrs. Emily Thompson Laumana died\nat Wailuku on Maui, on Feb. 12th.
