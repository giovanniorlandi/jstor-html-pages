        <pre>['THE RONAN PIONEER\nThe Oldest Newspaper on the Flathead Indian Reservation\nEntered as second-class matter May 12, 1910, at the post\noffice at Ronan, Montana, under the Act of March 3, 1379.\nVOL. V. NO.1. RONAN, MISSOULA COUNTY, MONTANA, MAY 1, 1914. $2.00 Per Year\nCOMMISSIONER CATO SELLS TALKS\nABOUT HIS INDIAN WARDS\nThe Hon. Cato Sells, commis\nsioner of Indian Affairs, has is\nsued a bulletin directed to reser\nvation superintendents which\nwill be interesting reading to\nmany people on the Flathead,\nand will meet with the approval\nof a great many here. The con\nditions he complains of are ap\nparent and the wonder is that a\nchange has not been inaugur\nated ere this. The commission\ner\'s letter is as follows:\nTo all reservation superinten\ndents:\nI greatly desire it to be under\nstood throughout the service that\nthe present administration of In\ndian affairs is determined that\nevery Indian shall have oppor\ntunity and encouragement to ac\ncomplish industrial betterment.\nI want you to know that the\nmagnitude of this undertaking is\nfully realized, and while I do not\nthink it can be accomblished in\none summer nor that it can be\ndone without hard work and some\nsacrifice on the part of all of us,\nI am firmly of the opinion that it\ncan be, should be, and must be\ndone.\nI am not at all satisfied with\nthe agricultural, stock and in\ndustrial conditions generally ex\nisting throughout the Indian\ncountry and I am determined\nthat unceasing effort shall be pul\nforth to bring about a radical and\nspeedy change.\nPrimarily the opportunity for\nadvancement among Indians is\nlargely agricultural and stock\nraising. The Indians own the\nland and with proper encourage\nment can so develop their pos\nsessions as to insure ultimate\nself support.\nThe farming season is at hand,\nEvery farmer should at once be\ncome actively engaged in advis\ning and teaching the Indians how\nto prepare thle soil, the kind of\nseed to select, when and how tc\nplant, grow and harvest, and the\nbest use to be made of his crop\nwhen produced.\nThe Indians should be made tc\nrealize that the grazing lands of\nthe United States are now almost\nentirely his own and that he has\nreadily within his reach the pos\nsibility of becoming the cattle,\nhorse and sheep king of America.\nAll these things involve earn\nestness of purpose and close co\noperation between the Indian\nservice employees and the In\ndians. To insure the best re\nsults every man charged with\nsuch a responsibility as farmer\nor stockman must devote his\ntime-every day of his time-in\nheart to heart association and\nhanJ to hand working in his par\nticalar sphere. It must be "a\nlong pull, a strong pull and a\npull together," as they say at\ns ^a.\nI cannot refrain from calling\nattention to a situation that is\nvery unsatisfactory. I have in\nformation from dependable\nsources and from all sections of\nthe country that farmers in the\nIndian service devote most, of\ntheir time to work associated\nwith the business end of the\nagencies; that our farmers, with\na few notable exceptions, are not\nin fact practical and helpful as\nfarmers; that they do not go out\namong the Indians on their farms\nas they should and as I hereafter\nearnestly desire them to do. It\nis almost discouraging to con\ntemplate that after years of em\nployment of men who have been\nespecially charged with the work\nof advancing the farming inter\nests of the Indians no more has\nbeen accomplished.\nCommencing immediately, I\nwish word to go down the line\nfrom the Indian office in Wash\nington to the agencies, and from\nthe agency throughout every\nreservation and to each allot\nment that every indian service\nfarmer shall give his time to ac\ntual farming and that under no\ncircumstances shall he continue,\nas so generally has been done,\nmaking the office work the first\nconsideration and the promoting\nof the farm work of the Indians\nsecondary. These things must\nbe reversed.\nCongress, the tax-paying pub\nlic and the Indians have a right\nto expect a full return for every\ndollar appropriated and such per\nmanent industrial advancement\nof the Indians each year, as will\njustify the maintenance of the\nforce of farmers and stockmen\nnow employed and give promise\nthat eventually they may no\nlonger be required.\nNor am I satisfied with the\nthe fact as I am new convinced\nthat the superintendents, gener\nally speaking, spend altogether\ntoo much time in the office at\ntnnding to duties which properly\nbelong to clerks, when the super\nintendent, to accomplish the best\nresults, should be out in the field\namong the Indians looking after\ntheir home comforts, after health\nconditions and in close contact\nwith them, giving personal at\ntention to their farming, stock\nraising and other relationships\nthat they may be encouraged to\ndo for themselves the things that\nthey cannot have done for them\nfor an indefinite period of time.\nHereafter, the superintendent,\nin place of devoting three-fourths\nor more of his time to office\nduties, shall devote a very large\npart of his time among the In\ndians on the reservation.\nI do not anticipate that the\ncarrying out of these directions\nwill bring about any appreciable\ncongestion of the so-called "pa\nper work" of the office. I be\nlieve the greater portion of the\noffice work will be found to fit in\nwith the field work so that it\nwill be done in connection there\nwith and without hindrance\nthereto.\nReservation employees should\nknow the Indians and know them\nwell; understand their condition\nand substantially aid them in\ntheir forward march toward self\nsupport and equipment for citi\nzenship.\nSincerely yours,\nCATO SELLS,\nCommissioner.\nWhitewash\nWhitewash is the cheapest of\nall paints, and for certain pur\nposes it is the best, according to\nFarmers\' Bulletin 474. Lime,\nwhich is the basis of whitewash,\nmakes a very sanitary coating,\nand is probably to be preferred\nfor cellars and the interior of\nstables and other outbuildings.\n(The following directions for\nmaking whitewash are taken\nfrom "White Paints and paint\ning Materials," by W. G. Scott:)\nOrdinary Whitewash: This is made\nby slaking about 10 pounds of quick\nlime with 2 gallons of water.\nThe lime is placed in a pail and the\nwater poured over it, after which the\npail is covered over with an old piece of\ncarpet or cloth and allowed to stand for\nabout an hour. With an insufficient\namount of water, the lime is "scorch\ned" and not all converted into hydrate;\non the other hand, too much water re\ntards the slaking by lowering the heat.\n"Schorched" lime is generally lumpy\nand transparent, hence the use of the\nproper amount of water for slaking\nand an after addition of water to bring\nit to a brush consistency.\nFactory Whitewash: (Interiors): For\nWalls, ceilings, posts, etc.\n1. Sixty-two pounds (1 bushel) quick\nlime, slake with 15 gallons water. Keep\nbarrel covered until steam ceases to\nrise. Stir occasionally to prevent\nschorching.\n2 Two and one-half pounds rye\nflour, beat up in one half gallon of cold\nwater, then add 2 gallons of boiling\nwater.\n3. Two and one-half pounds com\nmon rock salt, dissolve in 2% gallons of\nhot water.\nMix (2) and (3), then pour in (1) and\nstir until all is well mixed.\nThis is the whitewash used in the\nlarge implement factories and recom\nmended by the insurance companies.\nThe above formula gives a product of\nperfect brush consistency.\nWeatherproof Whitewash. (Exter\niors): For buildings, fences, etc.\n1. Sixty-two pounds (1 bushel)\nquicklime, slake with 12 gallons of hot\nwater.\n2. Two pounds common table salt, 1\npound sulphate of zinc, dissolved in 2\ngallons of boiling water.\n3. Two gallons skimmed milk.\nPour (2) into (1), then add the milk\n(3) and mix thoroughly.\nTOMORROW IS\nWOMAN\'S DAY\nTomorrow, Saturday, May 2,\nhas been proclaimed by Governor\nStewart as Woman\'s day in Mon\ntana. The proclamation reads:\n"Whereas, certain organiza\ntions of women throughout the\ncountry have called upon the\ngovernors of the several states\nto proclaim a given day for ob\nservance of the women of the\nnation:\n"Now, therefore, I, S. V.\nStewart, as governor of the\nstate of Montana, do hereby des\nignate Saturday, the second day\nof May, A. D., one thousand\nnine hundred fourteen, as Wom\nan\'s Day, recommending for\nthat occasion such special ob\nservance as may to the several\ncommunities of our state seem\nbest and proper."\nThe Pioneer has received a\ncopy of the "Red Man," a pub\nlication issued by the Indian\nstudents at Carlisle, which is a\nvery creditable and handsomely\nprinted number. The number\nreceived was a special edition en\ntitled "Liquor Suppression Num\nber," and contains articles on\nthe efforts being put forth by the\nIndian service on behalf of the\nIndian in regard to this problem.\nThe Pioneer is indebted to Major\nMorgan for the courtesy of re\nceiving the paper.\nAttorney D. N. Mason is in\nMissoula on business.\nThe Value of Advertising\nThe real estate firm of Bailey\n& Hull have every reason to know\nthe value of advertising in the\nPioneer. Their advertisement\nconcerning the sale of a certain\ntract of land has brought them\nsix different inquries within the\npast ten days from different sec\ntions of the country, ranging\nfrom Los Angeles to Michigan,\nEach of them wrote that they\nhad read the advertisement in\nthe Pioneer and wanted further\nparticulars.\nIn this day it is the fault of the\nadvertiser alone if his advertis\ning does not produce profitable\nresults. People read the ads.\njust the same at anything else\nin a local or daily paper. It has\nbecome a practice with readers\nbecause the ads. are often the;\nmost interesting part of many\npapers. They read them also\nfor the reason that it pays them\nto do so. It is by this medium\nthat they keep posted on values\nof everything they purchase or\nwho has for sale the particular\narticle or thing they wish to\nbuy. The advertiser who offers\nhis goods at less price than his\ncompetitor and tells the buying\npublic this fact, is bound to dis\ncover the benefit to him. It is\nalso the persistent advertiser\nwho wins out. Spasmodic adver\nis like anything else one does in\na hap-hazard manner, brings\nonly temporary returns. People\nforget such people are in busi\nness. While the Pioneer does\nnot solicit advertising in any\nmanner, shape or form, this\npaper believes that it pays to let\nthe people know what you have for\nsale, the price you ask for it, or\nthe things you wish to buy. It\nis the modern way of doing\nbusiness and the business man\nwho does not advertise must find\nhimself in the rear of the proces\nsion, with his competitors crowd\ning him out eventually.\nSPECIAL LETTER BY\nKENNETH ROMNEY\nWashington, April 24.-Mar\ntial spirit has pervaded Washing\nton the last week. Patriotic\ndemonstrations on the streets\nand perfervid speeches in con\ngress preceded the firing of the\nfirst gun at Vera Cruz; and now,\nwith hostilities with Mexico\nactually begun, the national cap\nital is afire with enthusiasm\nFrom the moment that Presi\ndent Wilson sustained Admiral\nMayo\'s demand for a salute to\nthe American flag at Tampico,\nthe feeling here has been that\nwar was inevitable. The usurper\nHuerta, it was believed, really\ndesired war as a last desperate\nmeans of uniting the factions of\nhis country and delaying the col\nlapse of his military power; it\nwas preferrable to falling into\nthe hands of Villa, the tiger of\nthe North. That the president\ncould have done otherwise than\nsustain Mayo, however, has never\nbeen even suggested.\nThe scene in the house of rep\nresentatives when President Wil\nson read his message to the joint\nsession of the house and senate\nwas one never to be forgotten.\nIn the language of Theodore Til\nler, star reporter for the Wash\nington Times, it was "epoch\nmaking; has had no parallel."\nHere was a peace-loving presi\ndent, after a year of unexampled\npatience in dealing with a deli\ncate situation, come to tell con\ngress that he had arrived at the\nparting of the ways with soft\nmeasures and to ask justification\nfor the use of the armed forces\nof the greatest nation on earth\nto secure amends for the indig\nnities heaped upon the stars and\nstripes. The galleries were filled\nwith lovers, of that flag, and the\nmembers of congress, cabinet\nministers and other distinguished\nofficials on the floor were, for the\nmoment, not statesmen and dip\nlomats, but American citizens,\nswelling with patriotic fervor,\ncheering the flag that has never\nknown defeat. In the diplo\nmatic gallery, too, were the rep\nresentatives of other nations,\ncome to see the dogs of war\nloosed for a struggle, the end of\nwhich no one can now see.\nAs the president began the\nreading of his fateful message,\nthe first war message ever per\nsonally delivered to congress, an\nPROSPECTS ARE GOOD THAT WAR\nWITH MEXICO WILL BE AVERTED\nominous silence settled over the\nassemblage. He had not pro\nceeded far, however before ap\nplause broke from every part of\nthe building-shouting, hand\nclapping, frantic cheering. It\nwas a double tribute to the man\nand the flag. During the brief\nten minutes occupied by the pres\nident in reading his communi\ncation, deep silence alternated\nwith the crash and thunder of\npatriotic demonstration.\nAs the pale-faced president un\nfolded his request to congress,\nWilliam Jennings Brvan, the\ngreatest living apostle of peace,\nsat near the speaker\'s rostrum,\ngrim-visaged, resolute, his fur\nrowed face a study in determin\nation. At the very beginning of\nthe second year of his premier\nship, his cherished plan for world\npeace lay shattered at his feet,\nthe work of the Indian dictator.\nAs wave after wave of applause\nswept through the legislative\nhall, he alone sat silent and un\nmoved. He was ready to go as\nfar as anyone in loyalty to and\ndefense of the American flag,\nbut he wished it to be the mes\nsenger of peace, or, in his own\nwords, the "flag that he loved,\nwhile other flags are only\nfeared."\nIt took but a short time after\nthe president left the capitol for\nthe house to pass the `resolution\nhe had asked. Republican Leader\nMann led a half-hearted opposi\ntion against the resolution, which\nwas passed on the final roll call\nby a vote of 337 to 57, most of\nthe republicans and all but five\nof the democrats voting for iu.\nThe house was in no mood for\ndelay and the opponents of the\nmeasure had hisses for their re\nward.\nAfter its passage by the house\nthe resolution was hurried to the\nsenate, which convened in night\nsession to receive it. An ob\njection by Senator Lodge threw\nit over until the next day; but\nafter quibbling over the wording\nfor many hours, the senate passed\nthe house resolution with the\nname of Victoriana Huerta elim\ninated, but not before word was\ncarried to the chamber that\nbloodshed had preceded its action.\nA war fever pervaded congress\nduring the consideration of the\nresolution. The recital by Reilly\nof Connecticut of a poem on the\nAmerican flag threw the house\nin a tumult. In the senate a pa\ntriotic reference by the brilliant\nJohn Sharp Williams of Missis\nsippi stirred the galleries to a\ndemonstration, and, for the first\ntime in years, the sergeant-at\narms cleared an entire section\nupon the order of Vice President\nMarshall.\nTHOR ROSEOC MEETS\nWITH PAINFUL ACCIDENT\nLast Sunday, while hauling a\nload of slabs for the reclamation\nat Post A, Thor Rosegg met with\na painful accident which will lay\nhim up for some time. He was\ndriving the load down hill and\nhad no break on the wagon nor\nbreeching on the harness, and\nthe horses were unable to hold\nback the load. The slabs slid for\nward and Rosegg was thrown off\nin Front of the wagon, one wheel\nstriking his leg near the ankle\nand simply pealed the flesh from\nthe bone from the ankle up a dis\ntance of seven inches.\nDr. Fuhrer was called and re\nports that with no complications\narising the injury should heal in\na short time.\nThere is not much doubt but\nwhat the war with Mexico is at\nan end. The United States ma\nrines and sailors are in posses\nsion of Vera Cruz and hostilities\nhave been stopped pending ne\ngotiations now being carried on\nwith Argentina, Brazil and Chile\nas mediators, these countries\nhaving offered their services to\nbring the matters in dispute to\nan amicable settlement.\nThe situation at this time is\nthat all the warring factions in\nMexico are to be asked to be\ncome parties to the arbitration,\nin hopes that a settlement can\nbe effected which will give to\nMexico a lasting peace, If the\nmoney interest will keep hands\noff now, the entire controversy\nmay be settled.\nWhile negotiations are pending\nfor a peaceful settlement of the\ndifficulty, the United States is\nrushing war preparations and\nshould nothing come of the offer\nof the Latin-American republics\nto make peace it is probable that\nthis country would wage a cam\npaign at once so strong and\nforceful as to wind up the war in\nshort notice.\nThere is every reason to be\nlieve that peace will be secured\nwithout futrher fighting or loss\nof life and it is to be hoped this\nwill prove correct.\nCorn Tests.\nThe agronomy department of\nthe Montana experiment station\nhas on hand a limited quantity of\nthree promising varieties of corn,\nand in order to find out about\nthe maturity of these in different\nlocalities, desires to have small\nplots of this corn grown by farm\ners in different parts of the state.\nThe varieties are:\nDakota White Flint, an early\nmaturing, low eared variety, es\npecially adapted for "hogging\noff" in the field.\nNorthwestern Dent, an average\ngrain and fodder producer.\nTriumph Flint, a promising\nsilage corn.\nFor six cents in stamps, which\nwill be sufficient to pay the post\nage on the corn, enough of each\nof these varieties will be sent to\nplant seventy hills. Planting,\ncultivation and harvesting in\nstructions will accompany each\npackage. Enclose stamps with\napplication for seed, to Alfred\nAtkinson, Experiment Station,\nBozeman, Mont.\nSome Big Trout---Story\nDeb.. 9Qeriff Wm. Engle is\ntelling a pretty big trout story\nthis week. He has a homestead\nsouth of town and one of the\nreclamation laterals runs across\nit. This lateral heads in one of\nthe reservoirs which has now\nbeen filled with water a couple\nof years, and from what Bill says\nthere must have been some big\nfish hibernating there since the\nwater was first turned in. He\nhas had some men hauling rock\noff the plowed ground during the\npast two weeks and the other\nday one of them heard a splash\ning in the ditch and thinking an\nover-zealous muskrat had ven\ntured too far away from his\nusu tJ haunts, proceeded to in\nvestigate. He was surprised to\nfind a big salmon trout flounder\ning on a riffle and picked up a\nrock (Bill says he doesn\'t ex\nactly see where he found it)\nand struck the fish and was able\nto land it safely. Upon the trout\nbeing dressed it was weighed\nand tipped the scales at exactly\nfour and one-half pounds.\nTo substantiate this story Bill\nsays that Jay Carr vouches for\nthe truthfulness, as if that helped\nany, and that Mrs. Carr cooked\nthe fish last Sunday. Not hav\ning heard what the latter has to\nto say regarding it the Pioneer\ngives the story and leaves the\nbalance to our readers. It\'s up\nto them.', 'THE RONAN PIONEER\nIssued every Friday at Ronan, Missoula County,\nMontana, by\nC. F. & E. H. RATHBONE,\nPublishers.\nADVERTISING RATES\nSpace rates on application.\nReading notices 10 cents per line each insertion.\nChurch and society notices charged for at regular\nrates in cases where profit is the object.\nLegal advertising at state rates.\nRonan, Mont., May 1, 1914.\nVOLUME FIVE\nThis issue is the first of a new\nvolume. The Pioneer has now\nbeen published four full years,\nand starts anew this week on an\nother year.\nThe four years which have\npassed seem short indeed, when\nlooking backward, but have been\nfrought with many changes in\nthe valley. The first year was a\ncontinual getting acquainted per\niod. All who came here were\nstrangers to each other. The\ncountry was in a virgin state; it\nall had to be made out of the\nrough, and many a valiant war\nrior suffered defeat. Some have\nfallen by the wayside who started\nout with hope eternal; others\nhave braved the storm and are\ncoming into port with colors fly\ning and bands playing.\nThe Mission valley is still an\nempire in the making; it takes\nmore than. one effort to accomp\nlish all that should be done. It\nis the same with the Pioneer;\nfour years has not made it all\nthat it was hoped could be made.\nIt has made errors; it has fallen\nshort of its full duty, not inten\ntionally, but by the same process\nthat all others do not exactly\nmeasure up to all that is expected\nof them. But through it all\nthere is the satisfaction of hav\ning done what it thought was\nright, regardlers of sentiment or\neffect. It is human to err, and\nhe who does not is in a class all\nby his lonesomeness.\nThe Pioneer fully appreciates\nthe business it has done and\nhopes to merit in the future a\ncontinuance of the same; hopes\nto be able to give more for the\nmoney and to do some good for\nall.\nSAVING MONEY\nThat was an exceptionally well\nwritten article in a late number\nof the Saturday Evening Post\nwhich told about the efforts be\ning made by so many of the\nlarge insurance companies, man\nufacturing concerns, department\nstores, and other large enter\nprises in the east to induce the\nemployees to save their money.\nThe loan-shark curse had so long\nmade the employees nervous\nwrecks and swept away the.\nearnings of the same that it be\ncame a serious question as to how\nbest combat the evil. Finally a\nscheme was thought out by which\nloans would be made to those\nwho were at that time in the\ngrasp of the sharks and to pro\nvide a method by which others\nmight be accommodated in times\nof stress which has been very\nsuccessful. It has been found\nthat the concerns receive better\nservice and that the employees\nare saving their money and are\nmore satisfied and contented.\nThis scheme contained a means\nby which a saving could be as\nsured each week or month, ac\ncording to the pay day. The\nlaying aside of money was merely\nan opportunity of doing so, and\neach pay day the employee was\nsolicited to deposit a small\namount, from five cents up, ac\ncording to the pay and the urgent\ndemand upon the one receiving\nthe money. Interest is paid up\non such deposits and this method\nwas found to be to the advantage\nof both those who save and those\nwho invest the money.\nSome of the concerns which\nintroduced this scheme in their\ninstitutions have also provided\na wao by which their employees\ncould purchase stock in the busi\nness. This was found to work\nnicely also, it creating in each\npne an interest in the work he or\ný ay be engaged in and the\nattention to small details did not\nescape them so readily as before.\nThe employee and the employer\nboth profited and there appears\na good prospect that this method\nwill be increased greatly in the\nfuture.\nThe article in question is one\nwhich everybody should read, as\nit opens up a road to co-operation\nand assistance which augers well\nfor the welfare of the working\nclass in cities and affords them\nthe opportunity of acquiring\nhomes and becoming more inde\npendent than any other hereto\nfore devised.\nRONAN LOCAL FARMERS\nSOCIETY OF EQUITY;\nD. McGuire of Hamilton, or\nganized the Ronan local of the\nFarmers Society of Equity last\nSaturday evening at the Catholic\nclub room, with 19 charter mem\nbers. The officers elected were\nJames Grant, president; Cash\nCoulter, vice president, and John\nThirkell, secretary-treasurer.\nThe local will meet hereafter\non the 2nd and 4th Saturday\nevenings of each month at the\nParish club room at 8 o\'clock.\nConsidering the short time Mr.\nMcGuire spent in canvassing the\nfarmers of this section, the local\nstarts out with a flattering mem\nbership. It is expected that a\nmembership of 100 will be secur\ned in a very short time.\nThis society is purely a busi\nness organization, the main ob\nject being to find a ready market\nlocal if possible, for the products\nof the farms. Politics is some\nthing absolutely prohibited, ow\ning no doubt to the failure of so\nmany similar societies by having\npartisan politics usurp the func\ntions originally rplanned.\nA letter from George H. Bom\nbard now of Blaine, Washington,\nbut who has a ranch west of\ntown which he homesteaded, an\nnounces that he has taken unto\nhimself a wife and that they ex\npect to return to the Flathead\nthis fall or next spring at the\nvery latest. He asks for some\ncommercial club literature con\ncerning the Mission valley for\ndistribution among his acquaint\nances, many of whom wish to\nbecome more fully acquainted\nwith the conditions here. To\nthis request we are unable to re\nspond for the reason there is\nnone. He sent in a generous\nmoney order to apply on sub\nscription and has the distinction\nof being the farthest paid in ad\nvance subscriber to the Pioneer\nat this date. If the writer were\nan active member of the Ronan\ncommercial club, and not engaged\nin the printing business, he\nwould suggest to that organiza\ntion that some literature be pro\nvided descriptive of the Mission\nvalley for distribution among the\nnumerous people who are asking\nfor same at this time. To su[,\ngest such a thing by the writer\nwould appear to be soliciting the\nwork, but if this office was never\neven asked to submit a bid to do\nthe work, it would still be a good\nthing to have the printing done.\nThere is hardly a day but what\nsome one asks for some printed\nmatter to send to their friends or\nto some acquaintance who has\nheard of the valley and wants\ntQ learn more. This literature,\nby the way, should tell facts,\nexcluding the panegyrical and\nall attempts at flights of rhetoric,\ndealing in the simple every day\nstatements that a good farmer\ndesires to learn more about. It\nshould give the price of lands,\nboth improved and unimproved,\nmarket conditions, products, rate\nof taxation and other pertinent\nfacts which all express a desire\nto know more about. This paper\nhopes that some influential mem\nber of that organization will take\nthe iniative to secure the con\nsumation of this object.\nThere have been many inquiries\nas to the lands to be sold by the\nsuperintendant of the Flathead\nIndian schools on the 21st inst.\nsince it was published that the\nsame were to be offered at public\nauction. Many people are pleased\nover the chance to make a bid\nfor the land and know they are\nto stand an equal chance with\neverybody in the sale.. Another\nfeature which adds to the inter\nest in the sale is the fact that a\nman with limited capital may at\ntend and make a bid on someone\nor more of the tracts with some\nshow of being able to purchase\na piece of the land. Under the\nstrictly sealed bid plan, the man\nwith only a little money could\nmake a bid on only one piece of\nfered for sale. He does not know\nwhether his sealed bid will be\naccepted or not and as the\namount put up by certified check\nwill be kept by the department,\nin case the sale is awarded to\nhim, he has been prevented from\nmaking more than one bid.\nUnder the new plan he can make\nbids on all the tracts offered\nuntil he has exhausted his ability\nto purchase or has bought all he\nwishes to buy. The present plan\nshould prove the more satisfac\ntory.\nAn election was held last Sat\nurday in what is now Toole coun\nty, on the proposition of framing\na new county out of portions of\nTeton and Hill counties, and the\nvote was favorable by a large\nmajority. Shelby was selected\nas the county seat, receiving 70\nper cent of the votes cast.\nLeon News\nThe members of the Worth While\nsociety were entertained by Mrs. Cary\nlast Thursday. After the business ses\nsion the books for the library were dis\ncussed, after which the members were\nasked to sign a petition to present to\nthe management of school functions at\nSt. Ignatius on May 8th and 9th, to\ncombine the same so that they may be\ngiven on the same date, as all the peo\nple are interested in both but would\nprobably be unable to make two trips\nto attend them. During the social\nhour the hostess served an elaborate\nluncheon. The members will be enter\ntained next week at the home of Mrs.\nNewett.\nThe School club held a very inter\nesting meeting last Friday evening.\nAfter the business meeting the pro\ngram consisted of a debate, "Which\ndid the most for his Country, the\nStatesman, the Poet or the Warrior?"\nThe general character of the argu\nments presented by both sides was by\nno means juvenile as is often the case\nwith high school debates and both the\nsubject, its treatment and the orator\nical ability of the various speakers lead\none to think it will be a very easy mat\nter for them to carry home the pennant\nnext week from St. Ignatius.\nMention was made during the recita\ntion by a class in current e\'ents that\nthe Mexican rebels have erected a guil\nlotine in San Luis Potosi. "Do any of\nyou know," the teacher asked, "Why\nit is called the guillotine ?" One small\nboy answered rather uncertainly: "I\nthink it must be because it cuts a man\'s\nhead off just below the gills."\nMrs. W. S. Tester who has been on\nthe sick list is very much improved.\nMrs. J. C.

Metlen, secretary of\nthe state highway commission, is\nsued a pamphlet early in the year\non the use of the road drag. Last\nweek he sent out a follow up let\nter in which he says:\n"I wish at this time to call your\nattention to the fact that now is\nthe season to start dragging your\nroads, "right after each rain,"\nwhen the soil is soft and will\neasily move into all the ruts and\nholes, is just the right time to\ndrag a road.\n"Don\'t get discouraged if your\nresults are not immediate, but\nkeep the ruts filled for this sea\nson through, and there will be no\nquestion as to what you will do\nnext season.\n"Use a light drag, one that a\nsingle team will pull.\n"Drag immediately after each\nrain.\n"Drive so the team will strad\ndle the rut.\n"Drive in a walk.\n"Ride the drag, don\'t walk."\nWere it possible to get every\nbody interested in good roads and\nget them to use their drags as\ndirected, the problem of good\nroads would soon be solved. Only\na few years ago Iowa had the\nworst roads of any state, but a\nwise legislature provided that\nevery farmer must drag the high\nway along his land, and today\nthat state has the best roads to\nbe found anywhere.\nThe experience of the Iowa\nfarmer should be of value to all\nothers and it might be well to\nfollow their lead in this matter.\nNotice-Close of Registration.\nNotice is hereby given that the reg\nistration books for the registration of\nqualified electors residing within the\nCity of Missoula, Montana, for the\nSPECIAL CITY ELECTION\nto be held in said city on Monday, June\n1st, 1914, will be closed Friday, May\n1st, 1914, at 5 o\'clock p, m.
