HARRIS TO BE, HAYS’OTETARY, INAUGURAL AUGUST 4TH, KEW GOVERNOR EXPECTED TO, BE DELUGED WITH PAR, DON PETITIONS., Little Rock, July 28.—Governor G., W. Hays is expected Tuesday to make, the announcement as to who will be, his private secretary. Senator Harry, Harris of Clarendon is expected to be, the person designated. Senator Har, ris has stated he w\'ould not accept the, position if it interfered with his sen, atorial duties. As. A. V. Smith, a, member of the house, has served as, private secretary to Governor J. M., Futrell, there will be no legal barrier, to the service of Senator Harris in, that capacity, though a legislative, session would interfere in case Judge, Hays continues to serve more than, the one term. A special session of, the legisjaxure, which is a remote, consideration, would also make a com, plication, but Senator Harris need on, ly resign during the session, taking, up fck work in the governor\'s office, again at its conclusion., Many who are awaiting for the in, auguration of Judge Hays, which w ill, probably take place one week from, today, with pardon petitions to pre, sent, will in all probability find the, same condition in the office then as, now. Judge Hays has presided over, circuit court for many years, and is, of the itpinion that so few innocent, people are convicted that few need be, pardoned. For that reason, it is ex, pected he will grant even as few- par, dons as have been issued by Acting, Governor Futrell. Judge Hays says, he will strictly enforce the laws, ard, grant pardons very sparsely., AT THE ARK WAY, _ 1, fn point of quality-pictures and va, riety of entertainment, the Arkway, is second to no other picture theater ;, m the state.
