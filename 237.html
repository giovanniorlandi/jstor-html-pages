        <pre>['CURRENT DOCUMENTS\nStatements on South Vietnam’s \nParticipation in the Paris Peace Talks\nOn November 26, 1968, United States President Lyndon Johnson and \nSouth Vietnam’s President Nguyen Van Thieu authorized the simultaneous \nrelease of official statements setting forth the terms under which South Vietnam \nagreed to participate in the preliminary peace talks currently being held in Paris. \nThe statements follow in full:\nSTATEMENT BY THE UNITED STATES \nGOVERNMENT\nThis statement is designed to answer the ques\xad\ntions which have been raised by the Government of \nthe Republic of Viet-Nam about new meetings in \nParis.\nPrior to the President’s announcement of Octo\xad\nber 31 of the stopping of bombing against North \nViet-Nam, agreement had been reached in Paris \nbetween North Vietnamese and United States nego\xad\ntiators that a meeting to discuss a peaceful settle\xad\nment in Viet-Nam should be convened in Paris.\nDuring the earlier discussions with the North \nVietnamese representatives, United States spokes\xad\nmen made clear that the stopping of bombing and \nthe holding of such a meeting would not be possi\xad\nble without agreed provision for the participation \nof the Republic of Viet-Nam as a separate delega\xad\ntion forming with the United States delegation one \nside of the meeting. United States negotiators \nmade clear to Hanoi that it might bring on its side \nof the table any persons it wished.\nThe North Vietnamese representatives in Paris \naccepted this proposal and indicated that they \nwould bring to the meeting members of the so- \ncalled National Liberation Front.\nIn the light of these facts the arrangements \nagreed to in Paris provide in essence for a two-sided \nmeeting. Hanoi clearly understands that our side \nwill be constituted as separate delegations of the \nRepublic of Viet-Nam and the United States.\nWhatever others may claim and however they \nmay organize their side, the United States has not \nagreed and will not agree that the meeting is, or \ncan correctly be described as, a four-sided or four- \nparty conference.\nConsistent with our view of the nature of the \nso-called National Liberation Front, wc will regard\nand treat all the persons on the other side of the \ntable—whatever they might claim for themselves— \nas members of a single side, that of Hanoi, and for \npractical purposes as a single delegation.\nIn the discussions between the United States and \nNorth Vietnamese negotiators it was made clear \nthroughout that, whomever Hanoi chose to bring on \nits side, the arrangement involved no element of \nrecognition whatever. The United States Govern\xad\nment has repeatedly made clear, publicly and pri\xad\nvately, that it does not recognize either the Na\xad\ntional Liberation Front or the Democratic Republic \nof Viet-Nam (North Viet-Nam). Concerning the \nso-called National Liberation Front in particular, \nthe United States Government has at all times \nregarded it as a creation of North Viet-Nam and an \nagent of Hanoi’s aggression against the Republic of \nViet-Nam. The National Liberation Front is not \nin any sense a separate entity, much less a govern\xad\nment.\nFollowing the stopping of the bombing of North \nViet-Nam, if Hanoi fulfills its repeated undertak\xad\nings to enter into serious talks—undertakings re\xad\npeated throughout the contacts between North \nVietnamese and American representatives in Paris \n—the North Vietnamese delegation must talk di\xad\nrectly and seriously with the Republic of Viet- \nNam’s delegation.\nIn the Paris meetings, the Republic of Viet-Nam \ndelegation will play a leading role, as was explicitly \naffirmed in the Honolulu Communique of July. \nThe Republic of Viet-Nam will take the lead and \nbe the main spokesman on all matters which are \nof principal concern to South Viet-Nam.\nThe new Paris meetings will be expected to ex\xad\nplore all avenues to end communist aggression \nagainst the Republic of Viet-Nam and to reach a \npeaceful settlement. They will start with a clean \n(Continued on page 116)\n109\n', '116 •  CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRUARY, 1969\nPARIS PEACE TALKS\n( Continued from page 109)\nslate. The sole agreements that have been reached \nin the earlier Paris talks between North Vietnamese \nand United States representatives have concerned \nthe stopping of bombing and the convening of a \nnew meeting. The United States considers that \nthere cannot be productive talks in an atmosphere \nwhere the cities are being shelled and the DMZ is \nbeing abused.\nIn the new meetings the United States Govern\xad\nment will operate in the closest cooperation with the \nRepublic of Viet-Nam, and in continuing consulta\xad\ntion with the nations that have contributed military \nforces to the defense of South Viet-Nam.\nThe substantive position of the United States \nGovernment will be based on respect for the sover\xad\neignty of the Republic of Viet-Nam, and on the \njoint communiques of Manila and Honolulu. In \nparticular, there has been no change whatever, and \nwill be no change, in the position of the United \nStates Government toward a so-called coalition in \nSouth Viet-Nam. The United States docs not be\xad\nlieve aggression should be rewarded and will not \nrecognize any form of government that is not freely \nchosen through democratic and legal process by the \npeople of South Viet-Nam. The imposition of any \ncoalition government would be in conflict with this \nprinciple.\nSTATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF \nTHE REPUBLIC OF VIET-NAM\nIn its constant search for peace, the Government \nof the Republic of Viet-Nam has been discussing \nwith the United States Government during the \npast weeks the ground rules and arrangements for \nthe new meetings in Paris which would enable the \nGovernment of the Republic of Viet-Nam to send \nits delegation to Paris to engage in direct and \nserious talks with the Hanoi Delegation, toward \nthe ending of communist aggression and the estab\xad\nlishment of a just, secure, and guaranteed peace in \nViet-Nam.\nAs a result of these discussions the United States \nGovernment has submitted to the Government of \nthe Republic of Viet-Nam a statement. By mutual \nagreement, that statement is being made public in \nboth Saigon and Washington at this time.\nIn that statement, we find that the major points \nin the message of the President of the Republic \nbefore the Joint Session of the National Assembly \non November 2nd, and the two-side formula pro\xad\nposed by the Government of the Republic of Viet- \nNam on November 8th, have been given satisfac\xad\ntion in their essential aspects.\nThe sovereignty of the Republic of Viet-Nam has \nbeen respected.\nThe Governments of the other allied nations \nhave been consulted and wholeheartedly support \nthe agreements achieved through the close coopera\xad\ntion between the United States Government and \nthe Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam.\nOnce again, the solidarity between the Govern\xad\nment of the Republic of Viet-Nam and allied gov\xad\nernments has been eloquently demonstrated in the \nface of the intransigent attitude of North Viet- \nNam and its auxiliary forces.\nTherefore, the Government of the Republic of \nViet-Nam decides that it is prepared to participate \nin the new talks in Paris with the Hanoi Delega\xad\ntion to show the good will of the Republic of Viet- \nNam and to test the good faith of Hanoi.\nBOOK REVIEWS\n( Continued from page 108)\nwith dealing with indigenous nationalist \nmovements. Consequently, diplomacy was \nguided by inadequate information “from \nthe field.” These matters and many others \nare mentioned in a book invaluable to \nstudents of United States executive deci\xad\nsion-making. The author speculates that \nthe tenor of the policy in Southeast Asia \ncomes down to . a serious question of \nprinciple, one with long-range implications, \n[arising] over the Administration’s deter\xad\nmination that ‘holding the line’ . . . con\xad\nstituted the only real choice of American \npolicy.”\nNATIONAL LIBERATION \nFRONT\n( Continued from page 87)\nTay Ninh jungles by North Vietnamese Gen\xad\neral Nguyen Van Vinh:\nWhether or not we will resume fighting after the \nconclusion of agreements depends on the balance \nof forces. If we are capable of dominating the \nadversary, war will not break out again. And \nthe converse also holds true.\nThat means that unless there is a settle\xad\nment on Communist terms in Vietnam, there \nwill be no settlement at all.\n']</pre>
