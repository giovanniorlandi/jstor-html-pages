The throe\nthings that eost the least and are the\nmost necessary to our existence are the\nmost dangerous when unrestrained.\nLast Sabbath evening my wife and 1\nwalked down to Jessie\'s house to comfort\nher in her sick bed, and play with\nllin ?...l V.~l.. -\nV..X. milt OHIO ttuil nil l?f IMC lllll"\nbaby boy. Suddenly the fire bell gave an\nalarm and my wife walked out on the\nveranda to find out where the fire was.\nIn a moment she came hurrying back\nand almost screamed. "It\'s our house?\nit\'s our house; run quick. Oh! mercy."\n1 threw the baby down on the floor?\nno. I didn\'t eithor?and departed those\nroasts with salaerity. Firemen and\npeople were hurrying that way. I\nstruck a fox trot for awhile, but sot*\nrelaxed into a fast walk, and then a\nslow pull up the hill, for I felt my palpitation\ncoming on. Ilefore 1 reached\nthe mansion 1 met some of the advance |\nguard returning, who said the fire was |\nout. So I sat down on the front steps j\nto blow for a minute. When I went I\nthrough the hall to the kitchen where |\nthe commotion was, 1 found our daughters\nand some good friends still\ndrenching the smoking walls and\npouring water down the fine up in the\ngarret. The accumulated soot of- twenty\nyears had caught on tire ana somehow\nget to the lathing and then to tiie\nroiling and dropped down to the floor.\nNobody was at home. The cook was in\nher cabin asleep. Her little boy was sit- j\nting on the back steps and when our j\ngirls arrived he very quietly pointed to\nthe kitchen and said: "Dar\'s a fire in ;\nMar." Then they heard the cracking\n(lames and saw smoke pouring through ,\nj a broken pane. On opening the door\nthey were astounded, for the whole\nroom seemed ablaze. One ran to tho\nfront door and streamed "Fire, fire,\nfire." ni.il tho-nlhnr u-i.nt t > tl... i. 1..\nphoiu and then t\'noy Hew to the water j\nfaucet and good neighbors gathered in\nnri< 1 filled the buckets and went to\n| work. They were just in time, for a\nde1.ay of ten minutes would have caused\nthe loss of the house and all of our\ntime-honored furniture an I pictures\njand books and my wife\'s tine clothes\nand golden wedding presents. When 1\nleft Jessie\'s house my wife hailed mo i\non the run and said save something,\n| but I am not certain whether it was\n, iier fine dresses in the wardrobe or her\nsilverware in the dark closet or her\nIliblc. 1 reckon it was the Bible that\nshe has read a chapter in every night\nfor all these long years. I had a good\nold Baptist aunt in Home and when\nher house caught on fire away in toe\ni night and the firemen came running i\nshe ran out in her night clothes and\ni begged them to save her Christian lni\ndex. She had a stock of them and treas- ,\n! tired them more than anything else.\nOur good old professor. Charles F.\nI F. McCoy, of Franklin college, used to\nlecture to us students, anl his favorite\nsubject was \'The Regularity of Irregular\nthings." and lie satisfied me\nthat the longer my lions-\' escaped a lire\ntile more I was liable to have one. The\nchances against me incro.se! as the\nI years rolled on, and so i have been cx|\npecting a fire. The insurance companies\nunderstand this and base all their\ncalculations and rates upon it. Thvy\ni will tell you what is the average life of\ni a dewlling. a store, a gin. a planing\nI mil or a church. The professor illusi\ntrated with a dice box and said if you\n; cast the dice a dozen times the six\n! spot might come up three or four times\nj in succession and the /ip? ewr.ni\nj times. but if you < aset the dice a thousand\ntimes, each number from one to i\nI six would show up about an equal nurn- ]\nber of times. That is according to tho\ni calculation of chances and proves the j\n! regularity of irregular things. So it is"\ni with the rainfall which, however tin- i\ncertain in its coming, amounts to\n; about the same every year. Since lSS3j\nthe losses by Are in the United States]\nhave averaged $105,000,000 a year, the\nlowest being $100,000,000 and the high-\'\nest $110,000,000. and yet In 1871 the loss\nin Chicago alone was $200,000,000.\nBut where did fire come from and\n: who gave it and when. There is no .\nmention of fire in the Mosaic account\nof the creation nor for two thousand I\n\' years after it. Cnt.il after the flood\nthere was not much need of fire, for\nthe pc >t\'h> were not permitted to eat\nmeat. Their food was the fruit of the\n! earth. Hut I reckon they did have fireand\nblacksmith shops and made hammers\nand hoes and nails, etc. N nli\ncould no* have built the ark without\nj tools and nails. The presumption is\n; that the Creator supplied Adam with\ntools to dress the garden and Abel\nwith knives to sacrifice the firstling? 1\nof bis flock, but there are Indian tribes\nin our day and negroes in Africa and ,\nEsquimaux in the Arctic regions w\'m ,\nhave no knowledge of iron or its uses.\n1 A thousand years before Christ. Homer ;\nI wrote that Jupiter only possessed tar\nelement that we rail fire and wh< n\nman was created man he refused to\ngive him fire. But Prometheus stolr j\ni nme from heaven and gave it to man\nand it made Jupiter so mad that he\nchained him to a rock and sent eagles\n1 t > cat his liver out and as fast ns tliev\neaf it by dnv ft>e liver grew again hy\nnight, hut finally lie was unchained I\ni and the eagles driven away. It seems\nI that Prometheus was a friend to m n(\nkind, and hy the command nf JupIC r\n; actually created man o>-t cf the mud\n; that was left after the flood not Vr>- ,\naii\'s food, hut the flood of Deucalion\naway hark in the ages. Ho was a gorl\n! noarlv as powerful as Jupiter and was\nI alwavs in a quarrel with him. Mo.\ntaught mankind arohitoeturo, nstron >mv.\nfigures, moiioine. navigation and\nall the arts that adorn life. At Athens\nand other an< ient eities. temt)les were\nhullt to his honor. They believed that\nthe very fire that he brought down\nfrom heaven was still preserved and\nwas always burning on an altar in the\ntemple of Vesta. It Is railed the snored\nfire?the Vestal fire?the fire of the\nI hearthstone a id must not he allowed\n! to go out. If it does go out from arei1\ndent even the family who loses It must\n>\ngo to the temple of Vesta, and get a\nnew supply.\nOf course all those "stories about the\npods are superstitious, but they are\nvery fascinating nets and old Homer\nstill stands 0.3 the greatest pOet, and\nranks as the equal of Shakespeare or\nMilton. That reverence for sacred fire\nis not yet extinguished, and it is said\nthat the Roman Catholic priesthood\nburn candles in their cathedrals day\nand night because the custom was\nhanded down from the ancient churches\nand those rhurrhes probably pot it\nfrom Grecian and Roman mythology.\nAnyhow, we know that the Jews had\ngreat reverence for fire, for they had\niu woe il in uit\'ii m:\'riiiirs, nun uoa appeared\nto Moses in a burning bush and\ndescended on Mt. Sinai in fire and the\nIsraelites were guided through the wilderness\nby a pilar of fire by night, and\nfire came down from heaven and destroyed\nSodom and Gomorrah and\nmany other important events wore\nmarked by fire. In our young days\nwhen there were no matches it was no\nsure or certain thing to find fire on the\nhearthstone every cold morning that\ncame. Some times the live chunk that\nwas buried in the ashes at bed timo\nwent out or was burned up. and then\none of the boys had to go to a neighbor\'s\nand borrow fire. It was alway3\ncalled borrowing fire, for it was reasonably\nexpected that the neighbor\nwould sometimes find himself in the\nsame condition. The Cherokee Indiaus\nmade fire by rubbing two hard dry\nsticks together with great rapidity. 1\nhave seen little Indian boys do it very\nquickly, and I tried to imitate them,\nbut I failed.\nBut if the good pure vestal fire came\nfrom heaven I reckon old Satan got\nsome of it when he fell and took it\ndown below. That\'s the kind that concerns\nlis most. The old preacher who\nused to go around preaching about the !\n"Mountains of Hepidam where the lion |\nroaretli and iho whangdoodle mourneth I\nfor its first born, and he played on a\nharp of thousand strings?sperots of ,\njust men made perfect." also had a few J\nbroken remarks about fire.
