        <pre>['In the past decade or so, a spate of books has \nbeen published about India’s rise in the global \narena. The vast majority of these are journalistic \naccounts of varying quality, such as those by Edward\nLuce, Mira Kamdar, and Anand Giridharadas. \nA handful of academic works have also attempted \nto explain India’s emergence and offered prescriptions\nfor addressing the many so-\ncioeconomic ills that continue to \nsandbag the country’s prospects. \nOne of the most informed and \ncogent accounts is Vijay Joshi’s \nIndia’s Long Road: The Search for \nProsperity, published in 2017. An \nearlier work that covers some of the same ground \nbut is more sanguine about India’s prospects is Arvind\nPanagariya’s India: The Emerging Giant.\nThe growing popular and academic interest in \nIndia is hardly surprising. Since the end of the \nCold War and an unprecedented economic crisis \nin 1991, the country has fitfully embraced more \nmarket-oriented policies, for all practical purposes \ndiscarded its hoary commitment to nonalignment \nin international relations, and ended its policy of \nnuclear ambiguity. Because of these policy changes,\nIndia has enjoyed robust economic growth, \nstrengthened its military sinews, and increased its \ndiplomatic clout. It is no longer an inconsequential\nplayer in global politics.\nThese important developments and significant \nachievements notwithstanding, India still faces \ngreat challenges both at home and abroad. Despite \nthe economic expansion, according to some estimates\nmore than a third of the population is still \nmired in abject poverty. The benefits of growth \nhave been extremely skewed, exacerbating existing\ninequities. Ideologically driven political ac-\ntivists have seized on these economic disparities \nand launched a range of violent social movements \nacross the country.\nAlthough members of lower castes have made \nsubstantial political progress, even after seventy \nyears of independence the country still has not \nbeen able to shed the pernicious legacy of the \ncaste system. Caste violence remains practically \nendemic in certain parts of India. More recently, \nthe country has witnessed a resurgence of the \nfuries of Hindu nationalism, \nwhich threatens to further erode \nits secular foundations. Finally, \neven though India has seen its \nwomen rise to the highest political\nas well as corporate offices \nin the land, the overall status of \nwomen still leaves much to be desired.\nAlyssa Ayres’s new book, Our Time Has Come, \nadds to the growing body of literature on India’s \nrise and challenges, making a useful but limited \ncontribution. The book does not fall squarely into \neither the popular or academic genres. Instead it \nis based on both her academic training and her \npolicy expertise on India. She served in the State \nDepartment during the Obama administration and \nis now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign \nRelations.\nHer book is invaluable in that it sketches out \nhow India has jettisoned a number of shibboleths \nthat had guided its foreign, economic, and security \npolicies. She discusses critical turning points, providing\nevidence to account for how these changes \ncame about and identifying the key players who \nmade the crucial choices. She demonstrates a \nmostly sound knowledge of the complexities of \nIndian politics and society, and is optimistic about \nthe country’s trajectory:\nDespite the hurdles India still has left to clear, \n[it] has already become a consequential global \nactor. As it continues to shed its past diffidence it \nwill realize its ambitions as a global power, likely \nin its more cautious way, in the decades to come \nin a way that was unimaginable twenty-five years \nback.\nSubstantively, the book focuses on how India, \nafter its long attachment to nonalignment and obBOOKS\n151\nIndia’s Turbulent Ascent\nSUMIT GANGULY\nOur Time Has Come: How India \nIs Making Its Place in the World \nby Alyssa Ayres \nOxford University Press, 2018\nSUMIT GANGULY is a professor of political science at Indiana \nUniversity and a Current History contributing editor. His latest\nbook, coauthored with William R. Thompson, is Ascend-\ning India and Its State Capacity: Extraction, Violence, and \nLegitimacy (Yale University Press, 2017).\n', '152 • CURRENT HISTORY • April 2018\nsession with economic self-reliance, finally came \nto embrace the world after the Cold War’s end. Yet \nAyres shows that India, despite formally repudiating\nnonalignment, has maintained its tradition of \nprickly independence in the foreign policy arena, \nespecially under the current regime of Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi. In her discussion of trade \npolicy, Ayres properly emphasizes that India has \nproved quite resistant to global pressures to open \nits markets. This reluctance stems largely from the \nexistence of a vast, inefficient domestic agricultural\nsector to which India’s political leadership \nremains beholden.\nAyres also shows how Indian industrial conglomerates,\nafter their initially hesitant response \nto a rapid opening of domestic markets, demonstrated\nan ability to compete in the global arena. \nShe underscores some of Indian industry’s notable\nachievements, such as the behemoth Tata \nEnterprises’ acquisition of the iconic Jaguar automotive\nbrand. Unlike Ford, which earlier had \npurchased the British company and struggled to \nturn it around, Tata proved remarkably\nsuccessful in that en-\ndeavor.\nThe concluding sections of \nthe book provide a set of sensible,\nworkmanlike, though \nhardly exceptional policy recommendations\nfor the United \nStates to pursue with a rising India. To Ayres’s \ncredit, she does not avoid grasping a particular \nnettle that has long been a source of discord in \nWashington’s relations with New Delhi: namely, \nhow to simultaneously manage a working relationship\nwith India’s recalcitrant neighbor, Paki-\nstan. For the most part, her prescriptions for \nhow best to balance these two relationships are \nlevelheaded. She supports a policy that an astute \nand able former American ambassador to India, \nFrank Wisner, helped formulate, known as dehyphenation,\nwhich sought to place US policy \ntoward the two countries on separate, distinct \ntracks.\nHowever, one or two of Ayres’s policy suggestions\nare rather stale. For example, she touts the \nputative virtues of continuing the US International \nMilitary Education and Training program with \nPakistan on the ground that this may improve the \nPakistani military’s regard for human rights. Sadly, \ndecades of bringing Pakistani military officers to \nthe United States under the aegis of this program \nhave demonstrated otherwise.\nAyres also discusses India’s troubled relationship\nwith China at some length. She notes that \nChina poses a key strategic challenge for India \nboth in the present and in the foreseeable future.\nROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT\nDespite the strengths of the book, I have a \nnumber of general and specific quibbles with \nAyres’s omission of some issues as well as the way \nshe handles certain others. The omissions are \nglaring. Ayres provides a fleeting discussion of \nhow the congressionally mandated US Commission\non International Religious Freedom has ex-\npressed concern about India’s record on the treatment\nof religious minorities in recent years. But \nshe fails to bluntly confront the growing specter \nof Hindu nationalism and its pernicious implications\nfor the fate of India’s democracy in general \nand for the plight of the vast Muslim minority in \nparticular.\nSimilarly, the book’s exiguous discussion of the \nchallenges of persistent poverty, growing inequality,\nand their consequences for \nsocial and political stability \ncan charitably be described as \nrather anodyne. This absence \nof forthright engagement with \nthe subject seems baffling given\nthat Modi’s predecessor as \nprime minister, Manmohan \nSingh, described the emergence of class-based \nviolent insurgencies as the single most important \nsecurity threat facing the country. Unfortunately, \nthe Maoist movement—known as “Naxalism” after\nthe region of Naxalbari in West Bengal state, \nwhere it first originated in the 1970s—shows few \nsigns of abating.\nBeyond these large omissions, some more specific\nobjections must be mentioned. Ayres de-\nscribes the manufacturing success that some industrial\nzones in the western state of Gujarat have \nyielded. There is no gainsaying the achievements \nof the state in promoting cutting-edge industry \nand generating high-quality employment in this \nsector. However, Gujarat’s business-friendly (as \nopposed to market-friendly) policies have come \nat a considerable social cost. Despite high growth \nrates, the state’s social indicators remain troubling, \nas the economist Jean Drèze has argued. Since \nModi rose to national prominence as chief minister\nof Gujarat, claiming credit for its advances, it is \nimportant to carefully assess the state’s socioeconomic\nrecord.\nIndia is no longer an  \ninconsequential player  \nin global politics.\n', 'India’s Turbulent Ascent • 153\nAyres provides a largely sound discussion of \nIndia’s hesitation about democracy promotion. Its \nunwillingness to readily take on this project is in \nsome ways puzzling. But clearly one of the key \nreasons for New Delhi’s lack of enthusiasm stems \nfrom its assessment of its own domestic democratic\ndeficits. Indian diplomats are all too aware that a \nmore activist policy might expose India’s domestic \nfault lines to the world. Yet despite some obvious \nlimitations, for the most part Indian democracy remains\nrobust. Consequently, India should not shy \naway from being an integral player in promoting \ndemocracy worldwide.\nAyres does not satisfactorily explain India’s fitful\nchoices on a related issue, the contested norm \nof the “responsibility to protect,” which calls for \nhumanitarian intervention by external powers \nwhen a government fails to protect (or attacks) \nits own citizens. New Delhi has been ambivalent \nin its support for the principle and, on occasion, \nhas opposed particular humanitarian interventions.\nAyres notes that this unsteady Indian posi-\ntion is entirely in keeping with its postcolonial \npreference for avoiding involvement in the internal\naffairs of other states. However, that is at best \na partial explanation. Indian diplomacy has waffled\non this issue largely because of the country’s \nrather disturbing record of inadequately protecting\nhuman rights when suppressing insurgent \nmovements on its own soil.\nThe limitations of the book notwithstanding, it \nis nevertheless a helpful addition to the substantial \ncorpus of work that is focused on India’s ascent. \nThose who are interested in a brisk, even breezy \naccount of where India is currently headed will \nfind it to be of interest. That said, the book fails to \nadequately address many of the crucial challenges \nthat India faces both at home and abroad. It may \nbe a trifle premature to proclaim that India’s time \nhas indeed come. ■\n']</pre>
