If\nthe gold standard act precip\nitated a panic, what a train\nof evils may we not expect\nwhen its perfect work of con\ntraction has had time to\ngrow?\nIf the advocates of the gold\nstandard bill are right in say\ning that we have money en\nough, why is the birth of the\nact heralded with so fierce a\ndemand for money that men\nfrantically offer 185 per cpnt\nfor it?\nThe panic in the stock mar\nket in New York followed\' 8\nlike panic in gold standard\nLondon, cut off from the\nsteady increase in gold trom\nthe Transvaal which has\nbrightened times for the past\nyear, the London stock ex\nchange went into a panic. A\ntelegram to the New York\nWorld tells what happened:\nLondon. Dee, 19. The pan\nie on the London Stock Ex\nchange today, caused by the\nreverse of Gen. Buller, was\nunexampled in the memory\nof the livinR. The opening\nscene was like bedlam, the\njobbers shouting like mani\nacs at each other, their faces\nwild with excitement and\ntheir hair disordered. All\ntheir cries and gestures were\nthose or demented creatures.\nThe best reputed Knifir\nstock, that of the Rand\nmines, fell six points in a few\nminutes. Others were totally\nunsalable at any price.\nMany men were ruined in\nhalf an hour. Some were to\nbe seen sitting on the steps,\npictures of desolation nnd de\njection.\n. When the first violent stage\nof the panic had exhausted\nitself the members resigned\nthemselves to a settled gloom\nand a more miserable collec\ntion of human beings could\nscarcely be found on the face\nof the earth. There was no\nhope to be gained from any\nquarter.\nThis scene ofhysteiicnlfear\nwas a striking contrast to\nthose witnessed on the declar\nationof war, when, in ram-\nIt has been domonstrated\nrepeatedly in every state in\nthe Union and in many for\neign countries thatChamber\nIain\'s Cough Remedy is a\ncertain preventativeanu cure\nfor croup. It has become the\nuniversal remedy for that\ndisease. M. V, Fisher of Lib\nerty, IV. Va., only repeats\nwhat has been said around\nthe globe when he writes \'I\nhave used Chamberlain\'s\nCough Remedy in my family\nfor several years, and always\nwith perfect success. We be\nlieve that it is not only the\nbest cough remedy, but that\nit is a sure cure for croup. It\nhas saved the lives of our\nchildren a numbers of time."\nThis, remedy, is for sail by\ndealers.\npant jingoism, the stock ex\nchange members sang the\n"Soldiers of the Queen," and\nin cowardly vain glory dis\npatched this insulting cable\nto Kruger:\n"For what von are. about\nto receive may the Lord make\nyon truly thankful."\nCommencing on these pan\nics in the two money centers\nof th English speaking world\nthe Columbia State, with\nmuch force speaks words of\ntruth and so.berness, as fol\nlows: "Yesterday\'s stock and cot\nton market in New York was\nbut the reflex of Saturday\'s\npanic in London. The British\nspeculators simply handed\n"hysterical fear" on to \'ours.\nAnd the fear was of the\nstoppage and loss of t h e\nTransvaal gold snpplv.\n"There might be devised a\nbetter illustration of the dan\nger of the financial svstern\nabout to be clinched upon\nthis country but wedoubt it.\nSo far as the republicansand\nrenegade democrats can com\npass it the business of the U\nnited States will be made to\nstand on one monetary foot.\nSomebody like Paul Kruser\ncomes along and steps on\nand crushes a toe of that\nfoot and the huge body\nwrithes and collapses. The\ndemocratic party believes in\nstanding on both, feet, on\nboth metals, so that if one\nsupport falls the other ie\nmains. While we have the sin\ngle gold standard we shall be\nconstantly at the mercy of\naccident and exposed to de\nstructive panic.\n"We hope most sincerely\nthat the apprehensions we ex\npressed last summer of the fi\nuancial consequences of the\nthen pending war in South\nAfrica may not be further\njustified than they have been\nin thelast few davs;t hat there\nwill be relief and recovery.\nBut there will be no perma\nnent safety for business for\nbusiness Until we have asour\nstandard of value something\nmore than a metal so limited\nin supply that the prospec\ntive loss of one year\'s produc\nHon of one country will breed\nterror and break prices."\nIf such a panic as struck\nNew York on Monday had\nfollowed the passnge of a free\ncoinage bill in the House of\nRepresentatives, tha bi-tuet-allists\nwjnuld have been held\nresponsible for the destruc\ntion of American commerce\nand of smirching "national\nhonor."
