No. 308.\nDODGING CALLERS\nKEEPS CONGRESS\nMEMBERS ‘BUSY 1\nSHOWN HOW THOSE UNWEL\nCOMED ARE HANDLED BY\nSECRETARIES OTHERS\nAT CAPITOL\nBy PRESTON GROVER\n<By AMBdattd Press)\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 28.—1f\nall the dodges members of con\ngress use to escape unwelcome\n(\ncallers were laid end to end\nyou’d wonder how anybody ever\ngot into the inner sanctum.\nSome senators see all comers.\nThat usually is the case when the\nsenator doesn’t have many visi\ntors. Few except the busiest of\nhouse members wil dodge per\nsistently. They have to go home\nand ask help every two years,\nwhich is quite often.\nTen seconds in the front office\nought to give you the tip on\nwhether your senator will see\nyou. If the front office secretary\ntells you coldly the senator is out,\nyou don’t rate very high there. If\nyou are told he is out but will be\nback at a certain hour, things are\nlooking up.\nLook Out For Skids\nWhen the secretary sets out to\nfind what you want and begins\nshuffling you off to some depart\nment with explanations to see so\nand so and then come back and\nsee the senator later, look out.\nYour visit’s on the skids. If for\nyour own personal prestige and\nfor the sake of the boys back\nhome you simply “must’ see the\nsenator, don’t tell too much. The\njob- of the secretary {Often it’*\nwoman) to impress upon you\nthat meeting the senator is as dif\nficult as buttonholing a Cabot in\nback bay Boston.\nIf the secretary asks you to sit\ndown but later arrivals are usher\ned into the inner office ahead of\nyou, your chance is poor, but not\nhopeless.\nOne classic concerns Miss Cora\nRubin, Senator Borah’s secretary. |\nA magazine writer asked to see\nthe senator, who was very busy.\n“He’s not in,” said Miss Rubin.\n“Where is he?”\n“Out in the park with his\nhorse.”\nOut went the writer, but as he <\npassed a closed door down the cor\nridor he heard the senator’s voice.\nAlmost at once Borah came out,\nthe writer had at him for a few\nquestions, then returned to con\nfront Miss Rubin.\n“By the wny,” he remarked, “I\njust met the senator galloping\ndown the corridor on his horse.”\nOne Keeps A Hideaway\nIn Senator Black’s office you\nwill be met by the Alabaman’s\nyounger brother, with a manner\nas gracious as ever crossed ’ the\nMason-Dixon line. If you don’t\nrate an audience, you will be\'\ntold, honestly enough: “The sen-1\nator is not in.” Those who are to!\nmeet him will be invited on some I\ncasual excuse into a back . room 1\nand there told where to find thej\nsenator, who has a hideout two 1\nfloors down.\nAsa last resort you can go\nover to the senate and send in a\ncard by a page asking the senator\nto see you. That won’t help much,\nfor even if the senator comes out\nhis mind may be occupied with\ndebate. But he may make an ap\npointment to see you later—and\neven the secretary hesitates to\noverride that.\nIf nothing else works, you can\nalways go home and try to beat\nhim in the primary.\nTAMPA FOLK ARE\nHEREFOR visrr\nMrs. Maria Pedrero and daugh\nter, Miss Mary Louise Pedrero, of\nTampa, arrived on the S. S. Cuba\nthis morning and are guests of\nMrs. Matilda Pita, at the home,\n907 Elizabeth street.\nMrs. Pita and Mrs. Pedrero are\nsisters and this is the first re\nunion during a period of 34 years.\nA DINNER THAT YOU’LL ALWAYS REMEMBER, YES, THE ONE THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WAGNER BEER.

Hill, executive assistant to\nFrank Murphy, governor general\nof the Philippines paid $9.75 to\nhave two absentee voters’ ballots\nsent to him in Manila. The ballots\narrived a day after the election,\nbut Hill made use of them.\nWhen he returned to Detroit to\nmake plans for his new job as sec\nretary to governor-elect Murphy,\nhe displayed copies of Manila pa\npers which printed the large bal\nlot. Filipinos, he said, displayed\namazement at the large number\nof parties on the ballot—and the\nlarge number of Murphy3 running\nfor office.\nIRENE ALBURY\nGIVEN HEARING\nDEFENDANT CHARGED WITH\nUSING PROFANE\nLANGUAGE\nIrene Albury was this morning\narraigned in the court of Peace\nJustice Frank O. Roberts, charged\nwith using language of a kind not\nheard in ordinary polite conversa\ntion.\nAsa matter of truth, as\nbrought out at the hearing, the\nlanguage used was such that the\npeace justice decided that the\nuser would have to explain her\nactions to a judge higher up and\nbound the defendant over for trial\nat the next term of criminal\ncourt.\nBond was fixed at SSO, which\nwas already in the hands of the\nsheriff, this amount having been\nposted in cash at the time the ar\nrest was made.\nMORE BIG BILLS\nCIRCULATING NOW\nTEN THOUSAND DOLLAR VA\nRIETY INCREASES OVER\nPREVIOUS YEAR\nilly Associated Press)\nNEW YORK, Dec. 28.—How\nwoqld you like to try to get change\nfor a SIO,OOO bill on a Sunday\nafternoon?\nThe possibility of the problem\narising was 50 per cent greater in\n1936, because the number of $lO,-\n000 bills in circulation in the coun\ntry had risen to 21 at the end of\nSeptember.\nA year previous there were only\n14.\nPractice Hapg Noose\n„ II Capitol\n\'tny AibLeiaCed lr*s*)\nOKLAHOMA CITY, Dec. 28.\nThe nodsß’ti<Wf by stfttfe officials\npracticing fdfc the bunging last\nJune 19 df Arthur Gooch, convict\ned kidnaf&i:, still\' is tied-and dan\ngles in’ a curtaih cord at the state\ncapitol.\nGooch’s hanging was the first\nin Oklahoma since statehood.

The old\nCongress, holding over until\nMarch, met in December and\nrushed its business to completion\nby midngiht preceding its end, with\nspectacular filibusters adding\ngaycty and danger to its conc\ning derberr.tlons. Now, with the\nelection about months behind, the\nnewly-elected members beg’n to\nfunction next week, thus biinging\nthe framework of the govern\nment into more responsive touch\nwith popular opinion.\nInconceivable as it seemed last\nyear the new Congress will be\nmore for the New Deal than ever,\nthe Democrats having added to\ntheir top-hervy majorities. The\nPresident,‘leader of his party and\nprobably holding {he future fate\nof m.\\ny members in his hands,\nwill 7 likelv experience little real\ndifficulty in securing his program.\nNaturally, there jjHU be debate\nand discussion, with some recal\ncitrancy h<*rc and Ae:*e, Lut in\nthe main the election is too close\nat hand and the members of hb\nparty will not care to be put on\nthe record against him.\nWe do not look for anything\nradical at the approaching ses\nsion. More likely the trend will\nbe the other way, with the gov\nernment being realigned along\nmore normal lyies. Th\'s does not\nmean, however, that the President\nwill be shorn of power for the\nchances are that he will continue\nto exercise predominanting control\nof legislation and enlarged execu\ntive authority for years. Mr.\nRoosevelt has not change*\' the\ngeneral trend of hb policies al\nthough he wi 1 not appear, at\ntimes, to be headed in the same\ngeneral direction as before. This\nwill be due to changed conditions,\nrequirng new approaches in new\ndirections, .rrther than any altera\ntion of the general course of the\nAdministration during the past\nfew years.\nWhat is an evidence of this is\nto be seen in the various moves\nnow being made to prevent a\ncredit boom. When the President\ntook office his objective was to\nbuild up the credit facilities of the\ncountry. Today, apparently it is\nto restrict the credit facilities.\nThere is no contradition. Back\nof both manoeuvres, that of in\nflation and the present braking of\ncredit, is the effort to secure sta\nb’e currency, to set the monetary\nlevel at a just figure and keep it\nthere. At times this may require\ninflation, at other times something\nlike a lid and that is what we see\ntaking place.\nLast week, for example, the\ntreasury Department stepped in\nto stem the flow of fold into bank\ncredits, announcing a decision to\nbuy miners’ metal and imports of\ngo J d with borrowed money. This\nwill sterilise the gold and not al\nloys’ it ta become a basis for new\nbank credits through the Federal\nReserve System. The technical op\neration of the plan will not be un\ndertaken, but it is in line with the\nrecently explained increase in re\nserve requirements and designed\nto prevent the piling up of exces\nsive credit reserves in the banks.\nThe danger of an uncontrollable\nboom is being tackled immediate\nly but should conditions arise to\nrequire larger credit facilities the\noperation will be repeated in re\nverse. While they are entirely dif\nferent both transactions are de\nsigned fer the same purpose, to\nkeep our currency lined up with\nnovmal needs of the nation.\nBacking the neutrality policy of\nthe government the Supreme\nCourt has rendered a decision up\nholding the authority of the Presi\ndent, under a joint resolution of\n| Congress, to proclaim an embargo\n|on arms and munition to Bolivia\n1 and Paraguay in the Chaco war\nfare. The Court drew a sharp\ndistinction between the right of\nCongress to delegate power to the\nPresident in dealing with interna\njtional affairs and any similar pro\n! cedure in regard to internal, or\nI domestic affairs. The Adminis\ntration has persisted in asking\nCongress for broad grants of pow\ner to the President, giving him\nwide discretion in limiting exports\nto combatant nations. The de\ncision, upholding this delegation\npower, is expected to have a\nmarked effect on future neutral\nity legislation and is considered\nby many authorities to uphold the\n1935 and 1936 neutrality resolu\ntions.\nOn Friday of this week the na\ntions of the world begin what\nlooks like the most formidable\nnaval building race that the world\nhas witnessed since the German\nGovernment challenged Great\nBritain\'s supremacy on the seas\nwith an ambitious pre-war dread\nnaught program. The London Na\nval Treaty expires on the 31st day\nof December, thus removing the\nban on battleships which has pre\nvented such construction on the\npart of leading powers since 1922.\nAccording to Janes Fighting\nShips, authoritative naval year\nbook, Japan is planning four 35,-\n000-ton battleships, Great Britain\nand the United States two each\nItaly is building two, and Germany\nand France are each building one\nand planning another. Heaviei\nthicker armor and\ngreater speed are expected when\nthe big ships take the ocean in\n1940.\nThe naval handbook, issued an\nnually in Great Britain, reviews\npresent construction and asserts\nGreat Britain is leading with 99\nwarships underway or planned,\nthe United States is next with 83,\nItaly is third with 66, France fol\nlows with 43, Germany 39 and Ja\npan 38, Soviet Russia’s program\nwas not available, according to\nthe editors, who are inc\'ined to\ndiscount Bolshevistic boasting as\nto anew navy, asserting that\nthere has been “grounds for sus\npecting some exaggeration.” Not\nsince the great war has such e\nquantity of new tonnage been un\nderway.\nSome few opinions on what ; s\napt to occur at the new session of\nCongress indicate that the Presi\ndent will not ask new taxes other\nthan the renewal of most of the\n“nuisance” taxes and manufac\nturers’ excises which expire next\nJune unless renewed by legisla\ntion, that he will seek extension\nof the RFC for at least another\nyear, that he will ask continuance\nof the huge $2,000,000,000 stab\nilization fund and the power to\ndevalue the dollar within the lim\nits set out by Congress and that\nhe is willing to consider changes\nin the new undistributed corpora\ntion profits tax to aid growing\nand debt-ridden business but with\nout impairing the general pur\nposes of the new levy. These are\nmatters that are certain to require\npositive action but there are oth\ners, such as relief, governmental\nreorganization, housing, farm aid.\nfarm tenancy, business regulation\nand amendments to the Social Se\ncurity Act which will be proposed\nby its friends and supporters\nrather than its opponents.\nIndications now are that revqpue\nfor the present fiscal year may\nrun higher than the budget esti\nmates of last September when\nDirector Bell figmed that income\ntaxes would produce $2,303,365,-\n000. By the end of December it\nis thought that income tax pay\nments will reach $690,000,000 as\ncompered with $559,000,000 last\nyea.. The big gain is looked for\nin March when payments on 1936\nincomes will begin. The second\nhalf of the fiscal year 1936 shew\ned cellectioaz of $867,000,000 and\nto get to the budget estimate the\namount must be almost doubled\n(Continued on Page Pour)\nLIGHTHOUSE\nDEPT.

It was his wish, however, to come\nhere, and he so expressed himself in a\nletter to this writer. These were his words:\n“I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you\nagain when you come up north, or when I\naccomplish a long-deferred plan, and go to\nKey West.”\nAN ESSAY ON BUYING AT HOME\nMillions of words have been printed\nand uttered in the interests of trading at\nhome and every community of any size\nstages periodical drives to keep the home\ntown dollar revolving in the circle of its\nbusiness enterprises.\nMuch ridicule has been poked at small\ntowns and cities as they attempt to de\nvelop into trading centers but the same\nambitions move the boosters of the larger\nmetropolitan areas and their rivalries are\non the same plane. It is laudable for any\nmunicipality to desire growth and, because\nso many cultural activities depend upon\nthe prosperity of business, entirely com\nmendable to encourage the growth of\nhome town enterprises, which provide em\nployment for local citizens.\nThere was a time in many cities when\na man or woman who bought out of town\nwas considered something of a misfit.\nThere was a general realization of the de\nsirablity of keeping money at home but\nnot quite such a clear conception of the\nway to turn the trick. It was generally\nassumed, in many quarters, that what was\nnecessary was a series of articles on trad\ning at home in the local newspaper at the\neditor’s expense and that was that.\nToday, more thatr ever before, it is\nbeing generally recognized that the job of\nkeeping home money in town is primarily\none that belongs to the merchants and\nbusiness men and that it is not to be un\ndertaken in the same way that colleges\nwork up pep for football games. There is\nno use to assail a fellow-townsman for\ntrading somewhere else when there is a\ndistinct advantage to the family pocket\nbook in so doing. In other words, trading\nbeing what it is, buyers are naturally go\ning to take the best bargains they can ob\ntain and it is the function of merchants to\nprovide them with the best buys.\nNo town can successfully institute\nbuying at home and keep it going unless it\npossesses alert, industrious and capable\nmerchants, who are able to sell merchan\ndise along modern lines, giving customers\nthe same advantages that can be obtained\nin other marts. Buying at home will not\nwork if all that it means is the snaring of\ndollars from unwary and unintelligent\nbuyers.\nKey West merchants have the ability,\nthey have the means and many of them\nare now exhibiting merchandising skill\nthat encourages the belief that buyers will\nfind it worth their time and money to shop\nhere.

He also has\ncollected a large number of news photo\ngraphs showing prospective lawmakers in\nvarious poses. All this material he has as\nsembled in a large album for study.\nThe reason for all this is that one of\nMr. Roy’s tasks is to be able to identify\nany member of the House when called up\non to do so by the speaker.

A\nstable price level, resting upon a mul\ntitude of individual instabilities, when\nthese reveal serious maladjustments,\nhas no virtue; it merely misleads peo\nple as to the actual nature of the most\nvital underlying factors.

But their asser\ntion in this respect has unduly sim\nplified the problem of the relation\nships between debtors and creditors.\nDebtors are interested in the\nsources and size cf their incomes; they\nhave only a secondary interest in the\nprice level. They pay their debts out\nof incomes, not out of the price level.\nCreditors are primarily Interested\nin seeing that they are repaid, and\nthey are only secondarily interested\nin the price level. They do not spend\ntheir incomes for the price level but\nfor only part of the commodities com\nprising it\nNor can people be divided into such\nsimple categories as debtors and cred\nitors. There are probably relatively\nfew persons who are not both debtors\nand creditors. And certainly all busi\nness corporations are both debtors\nand creditors.\nA change in the purchasing power\nof the dollar is one thing, but the\nquestion of who gets more or less\nof these dollars, more or less easi\nly, involves an investigation of\nthe facts in each individual case.\nA normally rising price level follow\ning a depression will be found to be\nmore beneficial to both .debtors and\ncreditors than will a stable price level\nwhich is artificially maintained In the\nface of various maladjustments such\nas those increasing unemployment or\nreducing the incomes of a great pro\nportion of the people.\nToday’s Horoscope\n!••••••••••••*••••••••••\nToday gives an affectionate,\nsympathetic nature deserving of a\nmuch better reward than likely to\nreceive.

Sally breaks\nher engagement with Terry when\nshe finds that he and her wilful\nyounger sister are in love. A\nwhirlwind of parties precedes the\nmarriage of Tip and Terry, who\nare about to] leave for South\nAmerica. Salty must face her\ncrowd and convince them she has\nnot been jilted.\nChapter 24\nA Dynamite Threat\nCALLY took off her wrap and laid it\ncarefully on the rose colored taf\nfeta spread that covered Mary Mor\nris’ bed. The ivory and rose perfec\ntion of Mary\'s room always dazzled\nher.\nThe soft rose rug made het foot\nsteps noiseless as she went over to\nthe dressing table to powder her nose.\nThe triple mirror caught three pic\ntures of her. Sally could not help\nseeing that she looked her best She\nwas glad she had yielded to the\ntemptation to get herself two new\ndresses, one for the party end one\nfor the wedding. Mrs. Warren had in\nsisted that they must not look dowdy\nbeside Tip.\nSally’s dress was chiffon, in soft\nshades of rose and blue. She had ar\nranged her hair differently, making a\nthick braid of it and winding it about\nher head, coronet fashion. It was nec\nessary that she look both gay and\nattractive.\nThe dance was an elaborate affair.\nMary had secured one of the best\norchestras. Against the masses of\nsummer flowers that decorated the\nrooms, the dancers moved, making\ngay, fantastic pictures.\nSally loved to dance, and never\nlacked partners. Tonight she tried not\nto see Terry and Tip, always dancing\ntogether. She danced often with\nPhilip Page, and when he was not\nwith her he was usually with Mary\nMorris.\nJoe Morris, Jr., was drinking too\nmany cocktails —consolation he called\nIt. He insisted on dancing oflen with\nSally, and to her dismay he treated\nher like the partner of his sorrow.\n“You’ve been thrown over, too,\nSally,” he said, as they danced. “Now\ndon’t deny that you expected to marry\nTerry Maynard, just as 1 hoped for\nTip.”\n“You’re wrong, Joe,” said Sally.\n“I’m not in love and I haven’t been.\nI\'m much too sensible. I know 1 have\nmy own living to make. I have to\nkeep my mind on that.”\n“Go on,” said Joe thickly. “You\nwant Terry, I want Tip. Everybody\nknows it.”\nBob Winkler, a boy Sally had\nknown for years, cut in on them to\nSally’s relief. Across the room, she\nsaw Mary and Philip break away\nfrom the dancers and go out into the\nhall. Philip was going for his inter\nview with old Joe Morris.\n“May I?”\nSomeone had cut in on Sally and\nBob Winkler. Without looking, Sally\nknew it was Terry.\nQuarrel In The Library\n“ A FTER tomorrow we’ll be off your\nJa hands for good,” said Terry,\nbreaking the silence that constrained\nthem.\n“It’s a long way —South America,”\nsaid Sally. Would he, Sally wondered,\nalways have this power to make her\nheart beat faster? He did not dance\nso well as Philip, or even Bob.. but,\ndancing with him was a keen delight’\nAfter tonight there would never be\nany more dancing with Terry for\nSally.\n"We’ll stop in Rio a week.” said\nTerry. “It’ll be the longest flight\nTip\'s ever made.”\n“She’ll love it” Sally said faintly.\n“You bet. She’s got nerve, that kid.\nShe’ll go anywhere 1 go, try anything\nI’ll let her. But you don’t need to\nbe worried about her. Til take care\nof her.”\nSally suddenly caught a glimpse of\nherself as Terry saw her —a sort of\nnursemaid for Tip. The idea was\nmore than she could bear. When the\nmusic stopped, she left Terry hurried\nly. making an excuse.\nShe fairly ran. In the hallway she\nhesitated, longing to get out in the\ncool darkness. Joe hailed her from\nthe supper room, but she hurried past\nOutside, the long porch which ran\naround two-thirds of the house seemed\ndeserted. The right wing of the big\nhouse was in partial darkness, with\na single light burning in the library.\nSally made her way toward the light\nShe would find a place to sit in the\ndarkness near the library. Perhaps\nPhilip Page would come out by and\nby and she could ask him to take her\nhome.\nIn the darkness, Sally ran against\na girl who was standing against the\nwall of the house, in the shadow of\ntall shrubbery.\n“Sh-h! It’s me.’ said Mary Morris,\ndrawing Sally into the shadow with\nher. "I’m listening in on Dad and\nPhilip Page. They’re having a terrible\nrow.”\nSally could hear the voices up\nraised in the library, angry, loud\nROACHES EAT “BUGS\'’ BOOK\nWASHINGTON.—Huge roach\nes in the offices of the entomolo\ngist of the Department of Agri-t\nvoices, both of them. “Can we get 1\ncloser and hear what they say?” she j\nwhispered. Mary answered by sliding\nalong the wall until they were beside\nthe lighted window and could see the\ntwo men inside.\n“If you know what’s good fo you,” !\nsaid Mr. Morris, who was seated at j\nhis desk, “you’ll get out of this town\nand stay out. You came here *o make\ntrouble. You’ll get it”\n“You know as well as I do.” said\nPhilip, “the Palace theater is un\nsafe. Horton condemned it That’s\none of the reasons he lost his job.”\n“Horton lost his job because he\ndoesn’t know anything about building\ninspection. He condemned the Palace\nbecause he was told to by people\nthat want to make trouble for me.\nI’ve had the Palace examined by com\npetent men. I carry insurance on it\nIt’s —it’s as safe as this house.”\n‘That’s only one issue,” said Philip.\n“Let’s get down to business. Do you\nintend to go on fighting against the\ntown’s demand that you clean up your\nslum districts?”\n‘The town’s demand!” Mr. Morris\nsnorted angrily. “You mean your j\ndemand. If yoir think a young pup\nlike you, who never owned a stick\nof property and never -trill, can tell\nme what to do with n*y property, then\nyou’re barking, up the wrong tree.\nNow get opt.” | . , ~\n“Certainly, Philip ; Pages\' voice\nwas cool agahi. “\'Yw vHU iemember\nthat you asked me to \'come here in\nthe first place.”\n“I did,” said Mr. Morris. T wanted\nto show you one of these threatening\nletters I’ve been getting. You say you\ndon’t know anything about them, but\nthat makes you no less guilty. Your\npaper has stirred up the riff-raff of\nthis town and got ’em so crazy they\nthreaten to blow up a man’s house.”\nHe waved a letter at Philip. "A letter ]\n—to me I—threatening 1 —threatening to dynamite |\nthis house.”\n‘Turn it over to the police,” said j\nPhilip, “if you feel the need of a j\nguard around your house. Good- j\nnight.”\n‘ln Love With A Criminal’\nSALLY and Mary crept around the\ncorner of the house and sauntered\ntoward the lighted rooms where the\nparty was still in full swing.\n“Dad didn’t tell me he had a letter\nlike that,” said Mary. “How exciting!\nSomeone wants to blow us up!”\n"I don’t think it’s exciting,” said\nSally. “It’s terrible. What if they\nreally try it?”\n“Oh, they never really do," said\nMary. “Dad used to get letters threat\nening to kidnap Joe and me, or threat\nening to bum down the house if Dad\ndidn’t send $200,000 by the next mail.\nMost of those people are cranks. They\nfind out a man has money and try\nsome silly scheme like that. Dad used\nto just hand the letters over to a\ndetective agency and they’d send out\na man and catch whoever wrote the\nletters. Nothing ever happened, ex\ncept I guess the blackmailer was put\nin prison.”\nSally shivered. At the moment she\ndid not envy Mary the rose and ivory\nroom. Money might bring you a thou\nsand delightful things you longed for,\nbut it brought also hatred and envy.\n“Being in love with Philip is like be\ning in love with a criminal,” laughed\nMary. “Dad has painted him ic such\ndark colors that every time I have a\ndate with him—which is very seldom\n—I feel a definite shiver of guilt.”\n“Philip\'s very good,” said Sally\nseriously. "He thinks very little about\nhimself, and very much about helping\nunfortunate people.”\n“Darling!" protested Mary, squeez\ning her arm. “You make him sound\nlike a missionary. If Philip were that\ngood. 1 wouldh’t be interested in him.\nBut he’s\ndoesn’t like vJdtfieivahb he’s a dread\nful fighter. That’s why I love him.”\nThe two girls almost walked into\nPhilip, who came striding out of the\nhallway with his hair slightly rumpled\nand Mis face full 6f \'fhundaiv\'\n“I’m sorry, Sally, I must go” said\nPhilip. “Shall I take you home, or\nwill you stay later and go with Bob\nWinkler?”\n“She’ll stay, of course, and so will\nyou,” said Mary. “It’s silly to leave\nthe party so early just because you’ve\nhad a row with Dad.”\n“I’m sorry, but I must go,” repeated\nPhilip. “You will understand, if you\ntalk to your father, why I can’t stay\nnow, and why I can’t possibly come\nhere again.” He turned to Sally.\n“Going or staying, Sally?”\n“I’ll go,” said Sally quickly. “11l\nget my wrap in a hurry.” She left\nthem before Mary could protest fur\nther.\nIn spite of Philip\'s impatience to\nleave, Sally took at least 10 minutes\nto get her cape. She knew that Mary\nwanted to talk to Philip.\nWhen Sally reached the porch,\nMary and Philip were nowhere to\nbe seen. Sally had decided to go in\nand look for them in the supper room\nor among the dancers, when she\ncaught sight of them. They were\ndancing together on the porch, just\noutside the French windows, through\nwhich came the strains of the music.\nSally sat down on the bench near the\ndoor and waited until the music\nstopped, then she rose. Philip saw her\natfonce and came forward.\n“Goodnight,” said Mary. Tm sorry\nyou must both leave. I’m afraid it\nhasn’t been a good party but I\'ve had\nan exciting time.”\n(Copyright, St St, Bailey Wolfe)\nculture in this city have been\nwaxing fat on a book “How To\nKill Bugs.”\nSubscribe to The Citizen.\nSYNOPSIS: Returning to his\nboyhood home, Philip Page buys •\nthe Warrenton Courie’r and backs\nthe workmen of the Morris mill\nin their fight for better homes.\nHe admires Sally Warren, the\nthoughtful society editor who has\nbeen in love with Terry Maynard,\nboyish blond aviator.

Wish 1 did know. Someone’s\nbeen blackmailing Morris for years,\nMary says. Of course they’ve caught\nsome people involved in conspiracy\nto kidnap, but this is different. I have\na hunch that all these letters come\nfrom one person —and that person has\na score to even up with Morris.”\n“There might be plenty of people\nlike that,” said Sally.\nMilltown was entirely dark as they\nrode through it. Philip left Sally in\nthe car while he went in and waked\nMcDonald. He and McDonald, who\nwas barefoot and had put on overalls\nover his night clothes, came down to\nthe car.\n“I can swear you the truth on any\nthing you lay in my hand, and before\nanybody.” McDonald was saying. “I\ndon’t know nothing about the letters\nto old man Morris. So far as 1 know,\nthere’s none of the hands working\nfor him that wrote them letters.”\n“I believe you," said Philip. They\nrode away from Milltown, leaving\nMcDonald staring sleepily after them.\n“What will Mr; Morris do about\nthe threats?" asked Sally.\n“He’ll try to prosecute McDonald,\nvery likely,” said Philip grimly. “If\nhe does, we’ll give the town a little\nexcitement.”\nGoodbyes At The Airport\nTIP and Terry were married in the\ngarden. Tip had anew dignity that\nbecame her as well as her simple\nwhite gown and her grandmother’s\nwedding veil. Sally kept her eyes\nsteadfastly on Tip. She could not\nbear, somehow, to watch Terry in his\nhappiness, to see his proud possessive\nlook at Tip.\nTerry’s own family looked at him\nalmost in surprise, as if they found it\nhard to believe that he had become\nthe town hero and acquired a wife,\nall in one week.\nOnce the ceremony was over, SaHy\nwas able to lose herself in the maze of\nthings to be done before Tip and\nTerry left It was she who helped Tip\nchange to traveling clothes. Mrs.\nWarren, suddenly realizing that Tip\nwas going far away from her. could\ndo nothing but sit and weep. Sally\nfound her father and sect him to com\nfort Mrs. Warren while she ran\n•cross the street to see to the luncheon\nWOULD BE HOSTAGE\nSHANGHAI.—Reports are that\nthe aged mother of General Chang\nHsueh-Liang, expressing deep\nthat Aunt Dora was preparing at the\nPage house. •• i* \'■ if \' \' rjb-\nSally found little to be done, for\nAunt Dora was an old hand at wed\nding feasts. She had made the beaten\nbiscuits with her own hands. The\nfaultless white wedding cake, too,\nwas hex work.\n“I be making one of these for you\nsoon, honey,” Aunt Dora told Sally.\n“You put you a piece of this cake un\nder yo’ pillow and you bound to\ndream of him you goin’ to marry.”\n“It’s too good to waste under a pil\nlow,” Sally protested. Nevertheless\nshe hid away a bit of the cake and\ntook it home.\nAt last Tip and Terry were ready\nto leave. Philip Page drove them to\nthe airport, with half the town fol\nlowing. It was Sally who said the\nlast goodby as they were ready to\nembark.\n“You’ve been wonderful,” Tip whis\npered, hugging Sally tight. “I won’t\never forget what you’ve done for me\nand —and I hope you’ll be as happy\nas lam some day—l do hope so.”\n“That’s the best thing you could\nwish me,” said Sally tremulously.\n“Goodby—and—good luck.”\nThen Terry took Sally’s hand and\nsqueezed it in a grip that hurt\n“Goodby, Sally—l hope we’ll be\nhere to do the thing up brown for you\nsome day!” He bent his head and\nkissed her.\nIn a daze of unreality, Sally\nwatched them climb into the plane\nand heard the deafening roar of the\npropeller.\nThey were off. Joe Morris led the\ncheer that followed them into the air.\nTwice the plane circled the town in\nfarewell, then it headed south. They\nwatched till it was a speck in the sky.\nPain Pierces Sally’s Armor\nEADY to go?” Sally was startled\nJtV to find Philip Page close beside\nher.\n“Yes.” Sally got into the car beside\nhim, glad she would not have to listen\nto Joe Morris or anyone else talk of\nthe two who had just gone. Philip\nwas the only one she could bear at\nthis moment. Philip knew.\n“Want to ride a bit before we go\nback to the ruins of the wedding?”\nasked Philip.\n“Please.” Sally huddled in one cor\nner of the car. Terry was gone. He\nwas lost to her forever.\n“I can’t bear it!” Sally cried out\nsuddenly. It was as if a sudden, sharp\npain had pierced through the armor\nof control that had protected her.\nHer hands trembled, her eyes were\ndry and burning. “You don’t know\nhow it is,” she said. “I love him. I\nlove Terry—l want him more than\nI ever did. I — l can’t face the rest of\nmy life without him.”\n‘This is the worst of it,” said Philip\ncalmly. “Get a grip on yourself.\nYou’ve been pretty fine. I’ve been\nproud of you. You can face this thing\nout, and you can get over it —just give\nyourself a little time."\n“A little time,” said Sally. She\nlaughed shakily. ‘Time —I’ve got all\nthe time in the world —to remember.\nTo remember how he looks, how he\ntalks—to remember how it feels to\nbe in his arms.”\n“Stop that,” said Philip roughly.\n“You’re only torturing yourself.\nYou’re forcing yourself to remember,\ntrying to hurt yourself.”,\n"I don’t care,” said Sally. *Tve been\nso sensible —I pretended to be so gen\nerous. I\'rj Mo 1& as\nwell aA Yflull\ndespise me. 1 don t care about that\neither.”\nrealize how .lucky he is—and make\nyou happy.**\nSally remember afterwards\nall that Philip said to her, or where\nthey rode. She knew simply that he\nwas her friend, that he was trying to\nhelp her.i r\n.
