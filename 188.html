Its principal feature should\nbe to strike at the trusts, and should\ndeclare strongly for the application of\nthe only possible remedy, tariff revis\nion. To the Democratic party the peo\nple of this country must look for re\nlief from the present Intolerable con\nditions. The tariff plank of the next\nplatform should be so framed as to be\none of the chief issues to the victory\nwhich awaits us.\n"In regard to the question of candi\ndates, I am for the man who will\nwin; but he must be a Democrat of un\nquestioned party loyalty, of recognized\nability, and one upon whom the party\ncan unite with unbounded enthusiasm.\nWhether he comes from the East or\nthe West, he must come with a clean\nparty record and a personality which\nIn conjunction with a platform consis\ntent With the Democratic ideas will\ncarry with him the promise of certain\nvictory."\nMr. Taggart, it will be remembered,\nIs a candidate for the chairmanship of\nthe Democratic National Committee\nto succeed ex-United States Senator\nJames K. Jones. His declaration can\nnot and does not Inspire the average\nDemocrat with hope, enthusiasm or\nconfidence in his party\'s success in\n1904. Mr. Taggart wants a candidate\n"for the presidency who cannot and will\nnot be found. The Republicans have\ntaken up the trust question as an Jssue\nand. whit Is morel the Roosevelt ad\nministration has established the fact\nthat the trust question must be set-\ntied on the side of the people. In this\nrespect also, Mr. Taggart is too late.\nAs fnr tariff revision, that is an issue\nupon which the Republican national\nconvention in 1904 will meet the Dem\nocrats more than half way. The peo\nple of the United States want no\nmore tariff revision of the kind illus\ntrated in the panics of 1893, 1894 and\n1895, undef the administration of that\nsaintly tariff reformer, the rotund\nGrover Cleveland. Mr. Taggart ought\nto commence again. He may do bet\nter the next time and there is plenty\nof time for him to do so.\nTimes change and even Indians\nchange with them. The principle part\nof the construction work on the Santa\nFe Central Railway has been and is\nbeing done by Indians from the Unit\ned States Indian Industrial School In\nthis city and from nt-ar-by pueblos and\nwhat is more they have proven them\nselves to be good, hard working and\nintelligent laborers. The old notion,\nthat no Indian but a dead one is a\ngood Indian, is fully exploded by this\ntime.\nA recent Democratic county conven\ntion in Iowa refused to denounce the\ntrusts. Another county convention in\nAlabama refused to denounce imper\nialism: a Democratic convention held\nin Louisiana refused to denounce the\ntariff, and now come the Pennsylvania\nDemocrats and refuse to denounce the\ngold bugs. The party is certainly in\na bad way if it cannot agree on at\nleast one or two things that should be\ndenounced.\nThe provisions of the traveling au\nditor law enacted by the 35th legisla\ntive assembly are already proving ben\neficial\' to the honest people of the ter\nritory. Hereafter tax collectors and\nex-ofllcio county treasurers, as well as\nassessors, will be held to a more strict\naccountability and this. In view of\ncertain existing conditions Is very\nnecessary. Under the new law, defal\ncations, like the one of Abran Abeyta,\ncollector of Socorro county within the\nlast few months, cannot and will not\noccur. The operation of the law has\nonly commenced, but its usefulness\nwill grow as time advances. Collec\ntors of taxes and ex-offlcio county\ntreasurers, as well as assessors, will\nbe made to understand that a public\noffice Is a public trust, and that they\nmust act accordingly.\nThe Las Vegas Optic, in a recent\neditorial, commends the members of\nthe commission who investigated the\ncharges against the management of\nthe Territorial Insane Asylum for their\ngood and efficient work and very pa\ntriotic and public spirit in giving\ntheir time voluntarily and without pay\n;or th\'s rather disagreeable duty. The\nOptic Is right. Each and every mem\nter of the commission is entitled to\nI hp thanks of the people of New\nMexico in this regard. That good will\ncome out of the investigation Is sure.\nIf abuses exist and harsh and cruel\nt\'eatment has been practiced, the re\nport of ibj commission will so state.\nThere will be censure where deserved\nand praise where it ought to be giv\nen. This can be safely assumed and\nwill no doubt be the case.\nFive thousand men took a negro\ncharged with criminal assault and\nmurder, from the workhouse at Wil\nmington, Dela., on yesterday and\nburned him at the stake on one or tne\nDrincipal streets of that city. In a\nsovereign state such awful things\nhappen and very little ado is made\nUUUUl 111C11I. ... \'\none of whom is guilty of the Wiurder of\nCity Marshal Jones at Raton, a few\ndays ago, and who were arrested for\nthe crime, been harmed In any man\nner by a mob at Raton, what a great\nhowl would have been raised all over\nthe Union that the people of New\nMexico were absolutely lawless and\nthoroughly unfit for self government.\nBut little credit is given the people of\nthis territory for observing the law\nand for allowing Justice to take Its\ncourse as In the case at Raton above\ncited. This is the difference between\nbeing a sovereign state and a weak\nterritory.\nThe County of Dona Ana has en-\nloved a Republican county administra\ntion during the last six years. This\nhas reduced the bonded debt of the\ncounty during the time mentioned ai\nthe rate of 8,000 per annum. During\nthe reform days of the saintly Grover\nCleveland In New Mexico, that county\n.m.w Democratic county administra\ntions, was plunged deeper into debt\nriht alone and dishonesty ana omn.\ncorruption were the order of the day.\nUnder Republican adminmraiioim\nhi rttpn state of affairs was imme\ndiately changed for the better and the\n,i.irt nf all business connected wun\nthe county became clean, efficient and\nTn he sure there were men\nand are now counties in New Mexico\nhnnoatlv administered by Democratic\nofficials, but Dona Ana was not in the\nline.

During his travel\ning about and afterwards, his camp\ning upon his claim, he encountered\nmuch bad water, which, together with\nthe \'severe heat, gave him a very se\nvere diarrhoea which it seemed almost\nImpossible to check, and along in June\nthe case became so bad he expected to\ndie. One day one of his neighbors\nbrought him one small bottle of Cham\nberlain\'s Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea\nRemedy as a last hope. A dose was\ngiven him while he was rolling about\non the ground in great agony, and In\na few minutes the dose was repeated.\nThe good effect of the medicine was\nsoon noticed and within an hour the\npatient was taking his first sound\nsleep for a fortnight That one little\nbottle worked a complete cure, and\nhe connot help but feel grateful.

The\neggs were cared for and about sixty\ndays ago hatched. Since then, the\nworms have been feeding on mul\nberry leaves preparing to spin their\ncocoons. A dozen of the worms are\non exhibition In a box at Salmon &\nAbousleman\'s store on San Francisco\nstreet. Mr. Salmon -was seen by a\nrepresentative of the New Mexican\nlast evening and talked very inter\nestingly of the ugly but valuable lit\ntle workers. In his native country,\nSyria, Mr. Salmon was engaged in\nraising silk worms and he is thor\noughly acquainted with their habits\nand needs. He believes New Mexico is\nan ideal country for the raising of the\nworms and he will endeavor to Inter\nest the .merchants , of this city and the\ndepartment of agriculture at Wash\nington in the establishment of the silk\nworm Industry here,\nThe egg of the silk worm ls,-about\nthe -size of. the head of a pit and re\nquires more care than \' the worm.\nEggs obtained in the fall of the year\nmust be kept away from warm\' rooms\nduring the winter and when the warm\ndays of spring come, they are remov\ned to the ice chest. This is done . to\nprevent hatching. The food of the silk\nworm is the leaf of . the mulberry\nand when that tree begins to leaf, the\neggs are placed where the sun will\nshine upon them and they will hatch\nIn three or four days. From 55 to 65\ndays after they have hatched, the\nworms ate ready to begin weaving\ntheir cocoons . r-: \';, -. ; \'\nThose on exhlbtion In - Mr. Salmon\'s\nstore are 60 days old. One of them\nhas woven her cocoon, but the oth\ners are still eating mulberry leaves.\nAround\' the edge of the box are plac\ned small branches of cedar in which\nthe worms go to weave their cocoone.\nIf not provided with a suitable place\nto do their weaving, they leave the\nbox and search for a place to their\nliking. If provided with leaves- and\nthe pine branches, they will never\nleave the box. About 15 days after\nthe cocoon is completed, the worm\nturns to a butterfly and cuts its way\nout, of course ruining the cocoon. A\nfew are permitted to do this In\' order\nthat they may lay eggs for the next\nseason\'s supply.
