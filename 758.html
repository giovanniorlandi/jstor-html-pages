Roosevelt, 42 years\nof age, became the youngest president\nthe United States has ever had. Three\nyears later he was electd as president\nby the largest popular vote a president\nhas received.\nThus Roosevelt, sometimes called n\nman of de?|jny? .served for seven yeax^ .\nas the nation\'s chief magistrate.

He\nwas one of four children who came to\nTheodore and Martha Bulloch Roosevelt.\nThe mother was of Southern\nstock and the father of Northern, a\nsituation which during the early years\nof Theodore, Junior\'s boyhood was not\nallowed to interfere with the family\nlife of these children during the Civil\nWar days.\nSo frail that he was Hot privileged\nto associate with the other boys in\nhis neighborhood, Roosevelt was tutored\nprivately, in New York and dur.\ning travels on which his parents took\nthe children abroad. A porch gymnasium\nat his home provided him with\nphysical exercise with which he comhatted\na troublesome asthma. His\nfather, a glass importer and a man of\nmeans, was his constant companion;\nhe kept a diary; he read so much history\nand fictional book of adventure\nthat he was known as a bookworm;\nhe took boxing lessons; he was an\namateur naturalist; and at the age\nof 17 he entered Harvard University.\nThere, he was not as prominent as\nsome others in an athletic way, as it\nis not recorded tbfct he "made" the\nbaseball and football teams, but his\npuny body had undergone a metamorpheBis\nand before graduation he\nbecame one of the champion boxers\nof the college. This remarkable physical\ndevelopment was emphasized by\nsomething which took place shortly\nafter he left Harvard in 1880.

The press generally attacked the\ny chancellor as a result of the increas>r\ning friction between the Berlin and\nt. Vienna governments. The feeling of\nr_ the newspapers was intensified when\n.a the chancellor early in September said\n>f the government saw no possibility of\ni- approving a bill for general equal\ni. suffrage as it came from the Prussian\ny lower house. The workers\' unions\n,(1 also turned against the chancellor, acn\ncusing the government of being re).\nsponsible for lack of food and of put\'s\nting the interests of the producers\n,f above those of the people,\ng. In his last speeches before the\n). reichstag von Hertling dwelt on the\npossibilities of peace being brought\nabout.

Carberry.\nA lively spirit was in eider.ce Friday\nat Jeffersdn Hotel, Columbia, during\nthe entire period of the meeting\nof the special committee to formulate\nand set into activity working plans\nfor the Good Roads movement now\nsweeping the entire country.\nMr. Carl Baer, the first speaker,\nbrought a stirring message from Illinois\nwhere the movement seems not\nonly to have accomplished greater results\nthan elsewhere, but where the\nentire state is already enjoying benefits\nout of all proportion to the cost\nwhich was largely borne by the automobiles.\nHe further stated that Mr.\nfttMjhilir Ay at.y ,\nment had promised in the near future\nto spend a week in South Carolina to\nassist in the same work here. "Seven\nyears ago," said Mr. Baer, "the peopl\nof Illinois asked the automobile owners\nto pay thirty million dollars for\nthe accomplishment of main arteries\nin the good roads movement, and the\nstate was asked to provide a similar\nsum." The state finally declined to t\npay its apportionment and the sum\nof sixty million dollars was rai=ed and\npaid with a tax of from $12.00 to\n$20.00 levied on the automobiles and\nthe saving in gasoline and tires is\nclaimed, alone, to have been twice the\namount of te direct tax named. \'The\ncar and the boy are the power of this\ncountry," contended Mr. Bner.\nSecretary A. V. Schnell, of the\nCharleston Chamber of Commerce,\nspoke of the necessity for adopting:\nsome such plan in South Carolina,\nfirst, the establishment of main highways,\nthe cost to be paid from automobile\ntax, and later, the tributaries\nof these main arteries, which would be\nfound so necessary, would be built by\ntaxing the farmer, who would he the\nthief beneficiary and additionally enjoy\ngratis the benefits from the main\nhiirhways to which he had r.ot contributed.\nMr. Rhett, of Charleston, and president\nof the chamber of commerce of\nthe United States, then spoke, stating\nfirst, that South Carolina is now in\nthe midst of a great crisis which follows\nevery war. He also asserted\nthat South Carolina had not enjoyed\nequal opportunity with other parts of\nour great country, having been oershadowed\nby New York exchanges.\nMr. Rhett stated the very small income\nof the people of South Carolina\nin 1914, compared with income of the\npresent year of two hundred and fifty\nmillions of dollars, with eigty to one\nhundred million income from the cotton\nmills, the total income for state\nheing much greater than ever before.\n"The motor trucks have come to\nstay," said Mr. Rhett, "and this form\nof transportation, like the automobile\nin common use requires a pood road,\nbuilt for permanency and to withstand\nthe hard usage. The cost of such\nroads varying from nine to eiphteen\nfeet in width alternately would ,in\nMr. Rhett\'s opinion, cost about $2.25\nper squire yard under conditions\nwhieh we may reasonably expect to\nprevail in a very sort time, and at this\nrate, twenty-six million dollars would\nconstruct the permanent hiphways in\nquestion in South Carolina.\n"The purpose of this meeting " \\\ncontinued Mr. Rhett, "is to create def- i\ninite and approved plans which may\nbe submitted to the legislature with\nthe request that a Highway Commission\nbe appointed which shall have\ncharge of constructing and maintaining\nthe highways in question from independent\nfunds for the main arteries,\nand that the required sum could no\ni doubt be raised by increasing the\npresent automobile tax of .25 her\nIT\nINOR OF ROOSEVELT\nted Press)\nlgs are half-masted on the White\nildings today on the announce3resident\nRoosevelt.

"Come on in; the I\nwater is tine."\n???\nI.KT I S IMI\'ROVK Ol\'lt STRKKTS j\nAt the Chamber of Commerce ban I\n|uet Friday evening Mayor fi. I\', j\nMorgan was called on by the chairman,\nR. P. Harry, for a speech.\nAmong other tilings, Mr. Morgan\nstated that he was in favor of street ,\n\'building in Union, street building on\na large scale. He said we had more\nsidewalks in Union than any town of\nits size in the State, but that our\nstreets were poor, very poor, and that\nhe intended, if he could get the support,\nto build streets, permanent 1\nstreets in Union. His statement met\nwith a hearty approval from the large\ngathering present.\nKFf\nI\nThe Times most heartily endorses\nthis movement, it has been a notorious\nfact that in winter our streets are\nwell nigh impassable. The mud on\nevery street entering the town, unless\nit be that portion of Main Street\nlooking West, gets into a sad plight\nevery winter Automobiles, and even\nbuggies, have great ditlivulty in passing\nover them.\nWe do not know what kind of\nstreets Mayor Morgan has in mind\nto build, but we believe we should\ngo in for downright permanent streets\nand streets of that kind must be built\nof bitulithie brick or of concrete.\nSuch streets cost money, but when\nyou spend the money you get something\nfor it that makes it worth while.\nIf we understood Mr. Morgan, he\nproposes asking for a bond issue to\nbuild these streets. We are in favor\nof such a move provided we build real\nstreets. No "Turvia," no sand day,\nno substitute, but the real thing,\nbrick or cement. Union would be thus\ngetting in line with the big road preposition\nto connect the county seats of\nthe State, and with Union Township,\nwhich has already voted a bond\nissue to build roads in the township.\nI.et us hear some more on the subject,\nMayor Morgan. Now is the time\nto move forward.\nOur eat says it takes considerable\n.licit to yet up these mornings and\nwash your face in ice-cold water, but\nhe further says that all good cats and\nlittle boys should have their faces\nwashed every morning.\n<;<><)l) UOADS IN DM!)\n(News and Courier)\nFrom one end of the country to the\nother the news of the day is that\nplans are being laid for road building\non a scale immeasurably larger\nthan has ever been attempted in this\ncountry heretofore.

Dr. Reid is from\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore,\nwhile Dr. Taber is from the UniverI\nsity of South Carolina, at Columbia,\ns. C.\nThe shocks which occurred here,\nthe two geologists report, were less\nin intensity than that which occurred\nin California in 1908 or the Charleston\nearthquake in 188G. In their report\nto Governor Yager the geologists\n. say in part:\nI "We believe the earthquakes were\n- due to fractures of the rock in the\nnorthern part of Mano Passage not\nfar from the northwestern part of\nthe Island of Porto Rico, and that the\nfracture which caused the shock the\nshock of October 11 (the first of the\nscries) was accompanied by a small\nvertical displacement of a very lim1\nited area of the sea bottom causing\nthe sea wave which rose along the\nshores soon after the shock. Dis1\nplacements of this kind are not uncommon,\nand portend no great disaster\nto Porto Rico.\n"The damage done by the shocks\nwas greatest in the western part of\nthe Island and diminished progressively,\nthough r.ot uniformly, toward\nthe east. On soft alluvial soils it was\n> greater than on more solid foundad\ntions in the same neighborhood.\n"The character of the construction\nof the buildings was responsible for\nthe great destruction wrought. Well\nmade reinforced concrete buildings\ni suffered no serious injury even in the\nregions where the shock was strongest.\nWooden buildings and the small\nnative huts, by yielding to the shock,\nwere not damaged."\nSuggesting types of buildings capable\nof resisting the shocks, the geologists\nsay: "Steel frame structures\nand reinforced concrete buildings are\nare strongest; the best cement should\nalways be used. Brick houses, where\nthe best cement is used, are fairly\nstrong. Wooden houses are entirely\nsafe.\n"All strong earthquakes are followed\nby after shocks, which gradually\ndie out in strength and in number.\nThe after shocks here have\ngrown infrequent and very light.\nThere is certainly no special reason\nfor expecting another strong shook\nin the near future."\nBLUEJACKETS GUESTS OF\nI.ON PON AFTER ARMISTICE\nLondon, Dec. 5.?

Cards were hastily\nprinted, and dispatched to the\nstations where the sailors were ex\nnected to leave their trains. Each\ncard clearly explained how the I^aw\nCourts could be reached, and in addition\ntold the story of the building\nfrom the time the cornerstone was\nlaid. As the sailors entered, each (\nman was told to sign the register, ]\nwith his home address, and it is the ]\npurpose of the officers to have these (\nregisters hound and placed among the i\narchives of the I.aw Courts.\nThe movement for the entertain- (\nment of the Americans also included <\nthe use of Westminster Hall in the ,\nParliament building if it became nec- <\nessary. ,\nClaude Miller, stationed at a camp 1\nin Metuchasen, N.

The swimmers\nwere in the water nine hours and\nhad to penetrate four barriers across\nthe harbor entrance, two of which\nwere composed of steel submarine\nnets. After they had attached their\nbomb to the side of the dreadnought,\nthey were captured nnd taken on\nboard the vessel and were there when\nthe warship was blown up.\nThey escaped without injury and\nhave returned to Rome to tell of their\nexploit which is characterized as one\nof the most daring and successful in\nthe history of navaj warfare. Only\nthe fact that the Viribus Unitis had\nbeen destroyed by Italian naval forces\npreviously had been made known but\nnow the details have been given out\nby the Italian Admiralty.\nThe officers who thus sent to the\nbottom a 20,000-ton ship, one of the\nmost powerful in the Austrian navy,\nwere Lieutenant RafTaele Paolucci and\nMajor Raffaele Rossetti. The attack\nwas delivered on the morning of November\n1, 1918.\nTo tow the bomb into Pola harbor,\nthe two Italians invented small compressed\nair motors to which were attached\nbombs. For six months the\ntwo naval men practiced in long distance\nswimming. The Italian Admiralty\ngave them the use of a motor\nboat.\nReaching the harbor entrance at\nnightfall, the two daring men started\non their expe<Jiti?n swimming beside\ntheir little motors and steering them.\nTo escape detection by sentries on a\nwooden pier across the harbor mouth,\nPaolucci and Rossetti had hats shaped\nlike bottles, and the sentry saw nothing\nbut a couple of bottles being\ntossed by the waves. Wen his back\nwas turned thcj- advanced and safely\npassed the first barrier.\nAfter infinite labor they fought\ntheir way through the steel nets and\nthe Austrian fleet lay before them.\nReaching the side of the Viribus\nUnitis, they attached the bomb to her\nhull beneath the ladder which led\nto her deck and timed the bomb to\nexplode at 6:30 a. in.\nBy this time they were exhausted,\nhaving been in the water more than\nnine hours. As they were leaving,\nthey were discovered and taken on\nboard the dreadnought. At first they\nrefused to answer the questions asked\nthem by Admiral Voucovich. At 6:15,\nhowever, they told the admiral what\nthey had done and he gave the order\nto abandon ship. Paolucci asked the\nadmiral if he an dihs friend might\nalso try to sav|i themselves and he\nshook hands sayirg, "You are brave\nmen and deserve to live." They\nplunged into the water and swam\naway, but 10 minutes later the admiral\nbegan to suspect the bomb story\nand sent a launch to bring them back.\nThey were made to walk up the ladder\nunder which they had set the bomb\ntvhich was due to explode in two minutes.\nThe ladder was crowded with\nsailors returning to their ship.\n"Run. Run for your lives," shouted\nPaolucci, struggling to reach the\ndeck before the explosion took place.\nHe and Rossetti had reached the deck\nand ran to the stern of the dreadnought\nwhen a terrific explosion rent\nthe air and a column of water 300\nfeet high shot upward. Admiral\nVoucovich again gave them permission\nto save themselves, and they had\nbeen swimming away from the ship\nfive minutes when they heard another\nexplosion and saw that the other\nbomb which had been left adrift had\nbeen carried by the current alongside\nthe large Austrian liner Wien and\nhad there exjdsAsd.^.\nThe Viribus Unitis was then lying\non her side, but suddenly the huge\nship turned bottom upward and Lieutenant\nPaolucci saw Admiral Voucovich\nscramble upward and stand\nwith folded arms on the keel, ready\nto go down with his vessel.\nMajor Rossetti and Lieutenant\nPaolucci were recaptured and taken\n...J ?
