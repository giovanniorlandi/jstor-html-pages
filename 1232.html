In some counties of\nthis territory a large portion of\nrailroad and corporate property\nescapes taxation this class of\nproperty rendering about ten per\ncent -and the Territorial Uoard\nof Equalization turns a do if car\nto every appeal made by the peo\nple for relief. On the other hund,\nthere arc counties which secure\npractically all their revenue from\ncorporate interests not that the\ncorporations pay more on like\nproperty in one county than an\no thcr but because in some coun\nties the corporations arc about\nthe only ones returning property\nfor taxation. Either proposition\nis unfair.\nThe most stiking example of\nthe latter proposition is in the\n\'Kingdom of Valencia," where\nSolomon Luna both reigns and\nrules. The assessed valuation,\nas it appears on the tax rolU of\nthat county for the year 1909, af\nter allowing for exemptions, was\nl,707,r74. The railroad, tele\ngraph and lumber companies ren\ndered $1,270,540.45 of the total.\nThis leaves a balance for taxa\ntion of $437,127.55, to be divided\namong a voting population of\n2,UUU. When it is remembered\nthat the Rio Grande flows through\nValencia county and gives it\nthousands of acres of the finest\nagricultural lands on the conti\nnent; that a number of the big\ngest sheepmen in the territory,\nincluding "King Sol," live there,\nand that the county is plastered\nover with laud grants, which arc\ncovered with valuable forests, it\ncan readily be seen how pitiable a\nfigure the\'eitizcus of Hint county\ncut in the payment of taxes.\nIt must not be forgotten, either,\nthat the taxes on that valua\ntion of $1,270,549.45 rendered\nby the corporations arc paid,\nwhile much of the remainder is\nucver collected and little attempt\nmade to do so. In other words,\nthe corporations of the "Kingdom\nof Valencia" render 74 tier cent\nof the taxable property there, and\npay on that rendition, whereas,\nas a matter of fact, they pay\nabout 90 per cent of all taNcs\ncollected; for of the the amount\nassessed against the citizens only\nabout one-third is collected.\nValencia, then, seems to have\nreversed the usual conditions,\nand by some means gets a tax\nroll through so that the corpora\ntions pay all, or nearly all, the\ntaxes, lint, laying aside the re\npublican declaration wherein\nthey "point with pride to grand\nold Valencia." does the miblic\ngenerally regard that county very\nHighly, notwitstanding this most\nastounding place of high finance?\nIt Is otic of the oldest counties in\nthe territory, and until recently\ndid not have a brick school house\nwithin its confines, and the terri\ntory paid foi the one it now has.\nIt has only one newspaper, and\nthat began publication after the\nHelen cut-off brought in new\nideas. Yet, it must be admitted,\nthat the people of Valencia have\na practice iu which they excel\nthat of suffrage voting alpha\nbetically, whether the registered\nvoter is present or absent. Ah,\nthere is system in old Valencia!\nWe will pay the highest mar\nket pries for hides, pelts and\nfurs.
