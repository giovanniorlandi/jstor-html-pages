ELEVENTH YEAli, SKAttWAY, ALASKA, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1908 \' PRICE, 10 CENTS, HOME POWER\'S BIG DAM BREAKS, A portion of the dam built by the, Homo Power company to increase the, storage of the water of Lake Dewey,, and which was not quite completed,, pave away last ni^ht and cmsed a rush, of water down the creek to the south., Sensational reports of the occurence, train d some circulation this morning,, but the principal stockholders J and, officers of the company are not disposed, to view the bieak too seriously.

The dam |, is composed of crib)in<j of very heavy, lorfs. twenty feet square and eighteen, feet high, the spaces between the logs, being caulked ar.d the spacc Inside j, tilled with earth ;.nd rock9. The sec, tion at fault is on high ground and had, not been tilled in in this way. It wa> i, thought the water would uot reach it i, so so >n but the rccent rain* brought, the lake up behind it and the pressure, was too much. The water *eems to, have forcea its way under the logs and, has shifted the section described, jbout two feet out of place. The rush, of water down the creeK caused con, siderable carnage to the property of, Mr. G. H Sturnill who has a wood saw, ing plant near the edge of the canal., Mr Sturgill lives near his little mill,, -le heard the rush of waters last nitfh\',, but way, he sayf, helpless agaiost it., He nays that h half mile of sluice boxes, were washed away am) a bulkhead, njured.

Late exchanges, to hand make It clear that he, changed his mind. Dispatches from Le, Man*, France, where he has been per, form inf before the French Aero club,, describe a most thrilling and success, ful exhibition given on the 23d ult. ,, making a new world\'s record over that, of his brother, Orvllle, and In the, presence of many notables and a crowd, of ten thousand Trantic people, Mr., Wright won the Aero club prize of, 11,000 and the Michelin cup foi the, greatest distance covered by an aero, plane in 1908. The accident to Orvllle, had whetted interest in the exhibition, and the great throng was ready for, impressions. The test began at 5:15, in the afternoon and the machine re, mained iu the air until forced to earth, by darkness., "The aviator got away nicely" says |, the dispatch, "sailing majestically up, the field. Around the upper turn, Wright swept back to where the thous, ands were gathered and began describ, ing ellipses. Round and round he went, with the regularity of "clock work anil, the steadiness of a railroad train. The, great crowd was at once dolighted and, amazed at the remarkable stability, ?hown by the aeroplane. In the gath, ering darkness the spectacle became, thrilling. The aeroplane could not, longer be seen at the further end of the, field; It appeared and disappeared in, the gloom like a white phantom, but, the sound of the ceaseless churn of the, propellors told the multitudes, which, had now grown frantic, that Wright, was still in the air. Matches were, lighted to keep track of the fleeing, minutes, and night bad fallen when, at, tbe thirty-third round Wright shut off, his motor and came lightly to the, ground., "With a mad cheer the crowd broke, through the lines and rushed forward,, only being prevented from hoisting the, American in triumph on their shoul, ders by charging cavalry.", Mr. Wright told the Associated, Press that he had descended only, because of darkness. He still had, sufficient essence in the tank to last an, hour., Mr. Wright took his achievement, with his usual modesty, but he said, that he was especially glad to have es, tablished a ntw world\'s record for that, he does not intend hereafter to carry a, passenger., STANDARD OIL AND THE CAMPAIGN, The statement coming from Standard, Oil that Hearst stole the letters which, baa entered so deeply into the cam, paign, sounds very like a certificate of, the correctness of his information, j, This little incident of the letter-read- 1, log has brought about a sharp and in., portant turn of atTairs. Suddenl\' vue, Standard Oil has becom- the \' .e con, tention of the campaign. *11 other, considerations are lost s\'^nt of? the, platforms and their pi; i*s are forgot, ten.

It is the result of the glare of, light that attends the political cam, paign. The opposition has scarcely, time to adjust itself to its position of, advantage resulting, when the search, light reveals au equally rotten place in, its own armor and the game between, the contestants tallies. Hut the com, mon people, accustomed to trust these, individuals and who, by their votes,, believing them to be what they sot, themselves up to be, made them what, they are, stand amazed ut their, own blindness. However it is all ex, cellent business, most excellent. It is, an object lesson that will come home to, every citizen and put a check to the, maudlin sentimentality that, born of, the American\'s sense of justice and in, sistance upon fair play, has recently, bvei enlisted ia behalf even of this cor, ruptor of the nation because, forsooth,, the paltry tine of $29,1)00,000 for this, very sort of thing looks large to the, average citizen.

Our doctor examined her, and told\' us that she had scabies (the, itch), incipient paresis, rheumatism,, etc., brought on from exposure and tho, effects of her ragged-edged life. Her, poor body was a mass of sores from, scratching and she was not able to, retain solid food. W? tried many things,, a good tonic was prescribed and batns, with a nibbing of lard and sulphur. We, worked hard for seven weeks and you, can imagine how discouraged we were, when, after all that time, we could seo, so little improvement. One day I hap, pened to see a Cuticura advertisement, tolling how a little baby had been, cured of a bad case of skin eruption,, and although I had but ninety-seven, cents with me, I bought a cake of Cuti, cura Soap and a bottle of Cuticura, Resolvent. When I reached home I, was like a child with a new toy, and we, bathed our patient well and gave her a, full dose of the Resolvent. She slept, that night better than she had since, she had been with us and the next day, I located the price of a box of Cuticura, Ointment. I am not exaggerating, when I say that in exactly five weeks, thus young" woman was able to look for, a position, being strong enough to work, and full of ambition. In another, month she left the home, and now has, a good position in a nice family where, she Is resjieeted and is strong and well., You may refer any one you wish to me., personally.

Now at Manchester., Mass., visiting fikuds, Miss Ethel was, announced by Secretary Loeb on July, 10 to We giving a birthday party. Later, this was denied. Then Mr. Loeb decid, ed that Miss Ethel should be seven, teen on July IS. The president im, patiently and emphatically denied that, this date was correct. Finally Loeb, and Miss Ethel concluded that Aug, 10 would be as pood a time as any to, become seventeen. Now It Is said at, Oyster Bay that Miss Ethel will be, seventeen In September., It is thought strange that a man of, Mr. Loeb\'s experience should Indulge, in any discussion over the age of any, woman, young or old, for lives, for, tunes and kingdoms have been lost by, similar action. It Is contended that, he ought to allow Miss Ethel unre, stricted control over the number of, her birthdays, and If she bow insists, on having two or three a month let her, do so, for the time will soon come, all, foo soon, when she will Insist on hav, ing less than one birthday every three, years. Thus on her whole life she will, strike a pretty accurate average., Headquarter n for Mining and Commerciat Men, ST ret OT LY FIRST-CLASS, SHEA & PATTEN, I\'ROPS., Form.rly of The Original "PACK TRAIN", Broadway and Jttti Avenue , Ska {/way, Alaska, g CENTRALLY LOCATED BEST ACCOMMODATIONS, | New Home Restaurant, MRS.
