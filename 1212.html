It is truly a work, of art, from a typographical stand, point, and the Daily Times takes, pardonable pride in the fact that it, was a product of this office., GREAT SOUL OR GREAT NUT, Q, There is a man living in England, who is either a very great lunatic, or a very great patriot. He has just, recently sent his government a check, for $750,000, or rather he sent in that, amount of 4 per cent funding loan, bonds and asked that they they be, vancelled. He signed himself “F. S., T.” and said he was contributing one, fifth of his fortune to help the coun, try out. Of course the mails, during, the next few days, were loaded down, with bundles of war bonds similarly, sent in for cancellation. In your eye, there were., *! OH, WOMAN, We always knew there was some, good reason why women should not, smoke. And here it is: So many, English women have acquired the, habit during their war activities,, that they have doubled the demand, for cigarettes and the price. Poor, old man has no place himself, and,, whatever else the ferns took from, him, he could still count on his nico, tine. But now the women are after, bis smoke so hard that the price has, £one up until a man who smokes a, good deal and uses really good tobac, co has an expense account of about, $5 a week. The very least that an, average smoker of stogies and such, can get by on is several dollars a, week., VACANCY ON SCHOOL BOARD, r* —♦—, While there is an apparent lull in, territorial politics there is consider, able interest centering on the election, of a member of the school board to, succeed Tbos. S. Scott, whose term, expires and who will not be a candi, date for re-election. A number of, names have already been suggested, for this office, but as yet no announce, ments have been made. Some inicline, to the belief that a woman ihould be, a member of the board and we under, stand the parents of a number of, school children are advocating the, candidacy of one of their sex for the, position. Some definite announce, ments will likely be made during the, eoming week., NEEDS NO BOOSTING, While the residents and newspapers, of some towns feel it incumbent to, do a little boosting for their respec, tive communities Cordova has grad, ually forged ahead until it is now one, of the largest, most substantial and, most prosperous towns in Alaska. The, growth has been slow, but steady and, not the result of any booming. As, is well known there are few sections, that have the natural resources tri, butary to Cordova and the Copper, River valley. We have the copper,, fish, oil, gold and coal, all of which, are now being developed, and the, outlook here for the future was never, more promising. Cordova may be, truthfully said to be a substantial, town and one whose growth can no, longer be stunted., THE RIGHT MAN FOR MAYOR, The suggestion of the Daily Times, that Mayor A. J. Adams be tendered, ! a unanimous reelection has met with, i general approval and while we have, not consulted Mr. Adams as to his, wishes in the matter we feel that he, has the interest of the community, sufficiently at heart to be willing to, continue at the head of the munici, pality for another year, inasmuch as, it seems to be the wish of a large, majority of the voters., There was never a time when a, business administration of the affairs, of the city was so badly needed and, we believe that a representative coun, cil should be elected. The first step, in that dirction is to elect a good, mayor and no better selection could, be made than that of Mr. Adams. He, Is one of our oldest residents, a pro, perty owner, a loyal and progressive, citizen; in fact possesses all of the, qualifications necessary for an ideal, chief executive., SICK TIN, You all know about the man who, has a constitution like iron. No di, sease can touch him. But the figure, of speech is not well taken, it devel, ops, in view of the fact that metals, have diseases. Not only do metals, sicken and die of these infections but, they catch the distemper one piece, from another. One sick nail in a keg, of nails, without a quarantine, might, infect the whole lot., It was an English scientist who first, discovered the fact that a sick piece, of metal was catching. Contact was, all that was required. As a proof of, his statement he exhibited some, seventh century coins that were ob, viously diseased. They were covered, with large wart blisters. These blist, ers were on both face and back of, the coins and as the disease pro, gressed the blisters became larger., The metal finally lost its luster and, crumbled away., Tin is regarded as having rather, a delicate constitution. The first, piece of sick tin reported was in a, pipe organ at Leipsic. It was then, -thought that the vibrations of organ, caused the attack. Later some, interesting studies with blocks of sick, tin were reported from Petrograd., Also a quantity of uniform buttons, that had become infected were re, duced to a pulverized mass by the, disease. It was believed the extreme, cold weather had caused the trouble, Gold and silver seem to have beer, attacked recently in America by the, same disease. At least a man car, put a handful of coins into a pocket, and within half a day they are found, to have melted away., THE SEVEN WONDERS, Maybe this will be new to our, readers, and maybe it won’t. It was, found on a torn bit of newspaper, page the other day. Can’t say to, to whom to credit it:, The seven wonders of the wofld to, a small boy: His mother, his sweet, heart, his dad, his job, the gym’, the, public library, kis savings account., THE SPENDERS, New York stores report that the, millionaires are economizing and the, working people spending. Sales are, running fifty per cent ahead of 1919, in value. In the same connection it, is interesting to note that imports of, luxuries thrdugh the port of New, York have increased 125 per cent, over last year., LEGAL ADVERTiSI_TS, NOTICE TO CREDITORS, In the United States Commissioner’s, Court for the Territory of Alaska,, Third Division, Cordova Precinct, at, Cordova.—In Probate., In the matter of the Estate of John, Kachik, deceased., Notice is hereby given by the un, detsigned administrator of the estate, of John Kachik, deceased, to the, creditors and all persons having, claims against said estate, to exhibit, them, with the necessary vouchers,, within six months after the first pub, lication of this notice to the said ad, ministrator at the Bank of Alaska, at, Cordova, Alaska, the same being the, place for the transaction of the busi, ness of said estate., G.

He at once, assumed command and succeeded in, quelling revolutionary outbreaks. The, red flag was hoisted over the Bran, denburg gate and the royal palace, after wild scenes in Berlin,’ where, the people shouted “Long live the re, public!” and sang the Marseillaise., “The new government will be a, government of the people,” Chancel, lor Ebert said. “It must make every, effort 10 secure in the quickest pos, sible time peace for die German peo, ple and consolidate the liberty they, have won. The new government has, taken charge of the adminHr.Pation to, preserve the German people from oil n, war and famine and to accomplish, their legitimate claims to a itonomv.”, The Independent Socialists, includ, ing a radical element favorable to Bol, shevism and known as Spartacides., complicated Ebert's problem. When, he became chancellor many of these, radicals including Karl Liebknechl, and Rosa Luxemburg, were freed from, prison, and the two mentioned were, subsecuently assassinated., The national assembly which elected, Ebert was formed for the purpose oi, adopting a contsitution. Its documenl, which was approved last August 2, provided that “the executive powei, lies with the people.” The power o], j the upper chamber of the reichstag, was limited similar to the Brltisl, house o:f lords. There was special pro, tection for labor, and “generally ac, cepted rules of international law', were incorporated in the new inistru, ment. Ebert took the oath of office, on August 23, and two days later the, national assembly ceased to exist, f, being superseded by the new' reich, ; slag., 1 • Philip Scheidemann vras the, j first premier of Germany under Ebert, I Gustave Noske, formerly minister o:, demobilization, and before that govern, or of Kiel, was named the first min, ister of army and navy. By reasor, of his drastic enforcement of new reg, ulations he became known as a “die, tator.”, Other members of the first Eber, cabinet follows:, Minister of the interior, Herr Preus;, minister of justice, Herr Sendsberg;, minister of commerce, Herr Muller;, minister of labor, Herr Bauer; min, ister of foreign affairs, Count vor, Brockdorff-Rantzau, former Germar, minister to Denmark; under foreigr, minister, Von Richthofen; minister o], finance, Herr Schiffen; minister o1, postal and telepraphs, Herr Geisberg;, minister without portfolio. Dr. Ma, thias Erzberger, armistice commission, er, former state secretary and leader o, the Cetrist party; Eduard David, pres, idnet of the national assembly and, Herr Wissel., The Ebert government underwent, many changes by reason of political,, economic and popular demands., The first real crisis to threaten the, Ebert regime, however, arose over the, question of accepting the peace treaty, terms. Ebert, Scheidemann and other, leaders were opposed to yielding to, the entente demands. Scheidemann, resigned and a pro treaty cabinet in, cluding Dr. August Muller and ex-lab, or secretary Bauer, former Socialist, member of the reichstag, was organiz, ed. Bauer in a speech at Weimar, before the national assembly de, nounced the treaty in strong terms, but announced the government’s de, cision to sign., For weeks before the revolution, broke out in Berlin there was a steady, fun on German banks. Ebert, then, chancellor, had a conference in Berlin, on November 25, 1918, with 70 dele, gates from various parts of Germany,, and said: “Everything was in ruin, when we took charge. Now, how, ever, a Socialist republic has replaced, the monarchy, and power has been put, in the hands of the workmen and sol, diers.” The first aim to be achieved,, he said, was peace and the security, of an economic basis. Liberty, he, maintained, was worthless without, food and employment and it was as a, national assembly met last spring to, devise a constitutional form of gov, ernment., Meanwhile the provisional govern, ment had been in an almost constant, state of flux. Ministers came and, went. Owing to scarcity of food, cloth, ing and fuel, conditions in many parts, 1, of Germany were reported desperate, and there were many rumors that, Soviet government would supercede, the Ebert regime., President Ebert had the backing of, the Moderates of Germany almost, from the beginning. One reason for, this was that when he succeeded, Prince,Maximilian he announced that, property rights would be respected,, that no banks would be seized and, that the government would up-hold, the German war losses and pay all, claims on the state., The President in a New Year mani-j, festo said that 1920 would decide, whether Germany would maintain her, self as a nation. A week later he was, threatened by a mob in Stuttgart., On the preceding December 12 the, Ebert cabinet’s fall was reported as, likely as a result of the allied de, mands over the Scapa Flow sinkings, j, VANCOUVER DEFEATS, SEATTLE PLAYERS IN, FIRST HOCKEY GAME, SEATTLE, March 13 (by Associated, Press).—Vancouver defeated Seattle, last night by a score of 3 to 1 in the, first of a series of two hockey games, to decide the Pacific coast champion, ship.

He has a purpose in my, life with reference to this plan for, the world’s progress. No other per, son can take my place. I can take, no other man’s place. He has the, same claim as a specialist as I make, for myself. Yes I believe in my job., May I be kept true to the task which, lies before me—true to myself and, to God who intrusted me with it., I believe in my fellow-man. He may, n$>t#always agree with me. I’d feel, sorry for him if he did, because I, myself do not believe some of the, things that were absolutely sure in, , my own mind a dozen years ago. That, he may not agree always is of value, only as it can make the life of today, fuller and freer. There is no assur, ance of tomorrow. 1 must make good, today.—Rev. Charles Stelze, Sierra, News., An Every Day Creed, We’re never tired of talking of the, glories of popular government, and, very few of us admit that we’re ever, tired of hearing about them, but what, definite thing do we do to keep alive, that little spirit of democracy which, is native in the heart of every Ameri, can girl and boy? What do we do to, feed it and tend it and water it?, America depends for its life, its lib, erty, its happiness on a wide-awake, and conscientious citizenship but, what do we ever do to build up such, a citizenship? What do we do to bring, the individual sprig of democracy to, flower?—Herman Hagedorn in “You, are the Hope of the World.”, “Formation is better than reforma, tion.

How did your, inventory compare with your inven, tory of a year ago? What do you think, the result would be if your profession, were to have you scientifically inven, toried? Would the final result show, you to be an asset, a liability, good, will or unearned increment? Inven, tories and self-surveys are fine things, and determining factors. All should, make one of each frequently., “I would be friend of—, The foe, the friendless., I would be giving and forget the gift,, I would51 be humble, for I know my, weakness;, I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift.”, * Mothers, do you insist that your chil, drgn shall go straight to school from, home and come straight home from, schfcbl without stopping at anyone’s, house unless they have your express, permission. A word to the wise ought, to be sufficient., Quite often there may be seen on, the school grounds a fine, large apple, which has had one or two bites taken, from it and has then been cast aside., Do you caution your children against, wanton waste? Teachers may talk, “thrift’" with all their might, but they, can not hope to get lasting results, without parental co-operation. While, apples are expensive, the cost in, money is not to be compared to the, influence of the habit that is being, formed and the bad example to others., The reckless waste of paper by the, average American school child would, shock a thrifty foreigner. A few, words are written, a mistake occurs,, tie paper is thrown into the waste, basket instead of being saved and, usifld for scratch paper. Sometimes, we are tempted to issue a certain, amount of paper and allow only that, much to be used in a given period of, time, but this plan has many disad, vantages. Beyond a doubt the teach, ers can accomplish more in their cam, paign for thrift if the parents will help, by teaching thrift at home, both by, precept and example., NOTES BY PUPILS, _ i, (Elizabeth O’Loughlen), The first one hundred drills in pen, ¥, manship have been completed by the, high school and will be sent to A.
