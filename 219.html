JANTAUY 24. 1\'JIO.\nTWO COMETS NOW VISIBLE.\nThere are two comets now visible in\nthe western sky. The one Just above\nthe horizon, which Is now easily seen\nand has been observed by most peo\nple, has not yet been identified by as\ntronomers and there is a difference of\nopinion among them as to whether it\nIs one heretofore known or a new\none. They are studying Its move\nments and will doubtless soon be able\nto arrive at correct conclusions as to\nIts orbit. It is now quite conspicuous\nand Its path among the stars Is east\nward, so that It appears higher In the\nheavens and brighter on each succeed\ning night. It Is now travelling tall\nforemost away from the sun and will !\nbe risible until It fades away Into j\nspare. j\nllalley\'s comet Is now In the con- I\nstcllation Pisces, a group of small stars !\ni\na few degrees west of the planet Sa- ;\nturn. It is slowly Increasing In bright !\nnes. but Is still too faint to lie dls\ni\ntlnguished easily with the naked eye. ;\nSeveral people In Hrynn have seen It i\nat different times since It was first I\ndetected during the Christmas boll -\n, , ii .. , , .\ndays. Meanwhile it has passed from\n. . i. .\nCetus through Aries to Its present po-\n... . . .\nalt Inn in Pisces. Concerning Its\nmovement. Prof. See, of the Naval oh-\n. , . .\nservatory on Mare Island In San Fran-\ncIsco bay, savs:\n..... .... - 1 1 1\nIt Is now east of the sun and will\n.......... , , ,\nbe Just visible to the naked eye in\ntbe constellation rise- about Febru\nary 1; It continues to approach the\nsun. and about March 27 prt.iscs\nhind the sun. It will apepnr in the\neastern sky before sunrise toward tho\nend of April and enrly In May. Toward\nthe middle of May It ncaln near the\nsun and passes between the earth and\nthe sun on May V.. It will then be\nli.hon.non miles rrom the earth, or\nabout one-eighth of the distance of the\nsun, passing about twice as far out\nside of the orbit of Venus, as It Is\nwithin the orbit of the earth. While\nthe comet Is as near the earth, Its\nfllflht will be very rapid. In six days\nIt will pnss over the constellations\nTaurus. Gemini, Cancer, Hydra and\nSextans. And In a month or so it w ill\nbecome so faint as to disappear to\nthe naked eye. It Is not probable thnt\nthe comet will remarn visible to the\nnaked eye beyond July 1, but It will\nbe visible In telescopes till toward\nthe end of the year. It passes the or\nbit of Mars on February 3, and will\nreturn to that orbit about July 8.\nIf the earth passes through the tall\nof llalley\'s comet. It will lie on May\n19. The tall Is pointed from the sun,\nand the three bodies will be In line\non that day. Dut If we pass through\nthe tall It Is doubtful If we can set\nIt, except aa a faint phosphorescence\nof the sky.

Ix-ad goose feathers are Dot\nmuch better than husks to lie on and\nhave not that great virtue of bunks\nwholcsotneness,\n"They say It doesn\'t hurt a goose to\npluck It, but It seems to me that one\nmight as well say that It wouldn\'t hurt\na man to have his w hlsker yauked out\nby the handful. The reason they give\nfor believing a goose doesn\'t suffer\nwheu Its feuthers are being plucked\nout of It Is tliut It never equowka or\nsqueaks or makes a fusa while the\nplucking Is going on.\n"Now, 1 believe It hurts a goose like\nthe mischief to have Its feathers pulled\nout. coming aa they do from the ten\nderest spot on Its body, aud the rea\nson the fowl doesn\'t utter any protest\nprompted by patu Is. according to the\nway I have sized geese up, because It\nIs such a blame fool.

Induced, though, to try\ntho door, every goose will bob Its head\ndowu as It passes through for fear of\nknocking It against the top of the\ndoor Jamb, six feet above.\n"There is a man or a boy In every\nnelghlMirhood where geese are plucked\nwho Is an expert In getting the goose\nready for the process. Not every one\ncan do that. The wings of the gooee\nhave to le locked together by a pocul\nlar arrangement of the two near the\nshoulder, nnd. while they are not tied\nor fostened In uny other way, the lock\nIs such that no goose enn unlock It\nThe goose\'s feet are tied together with\na broad band of soft muslin.
