Provides for increased, Freight Rates to Recompense the, Railroads., ? >5 yky\' 1\' \', ;i ^, Washington, Aug. 25.? Objections, which developed last night at a meeting, of railroad presidents and managers, to points in the tentative plan, | - evolved by the committee of eight, presidents considering ways to avoid, the threatened general strike, resulted, k in a further postponement of final, ?* * - _ J i., action, ine conierence aajoumeu iu, meet again today and, as one presi- j, r \' ,dent phrased it, the situation is such J, that "it may be settled in \'20 minutes, or the matter may go over until next, i week.", f The speciaT committee\'s plan, draft(, , ed/aft?r a week\'s consideration, would, provide for granting an 8-hour, "basic" day to the trainmen, but with, assurance that every effort would be, made by the Administration to secure, a freight rate Increase toi recompense, the roads, and further assurance, that Congress would be asked to, enact legislation to insure settlement, of future labor disputes through an, investigating commission., The entire plan has not been laid, before all the executives and managers,, but its points have been discussed, at the various conferences. It developed, after last night\'s meeting that, objection had been raised to the!, freight rate increase feature on at j, least two grounds, It was argued byj, t some that there could he no assurance, of a rate increase, because no, on could say what the Interstate Commerce, Commission might do, and that,, some of the most important shippers !, of the country already had made it, plain that they were not in sympathy j, with any move which might mean a i, rate increase. It was* pointed out also, that alttaoygh President Wiison had, expressed his belief that such a rate, increase should be granted ;-if the 8j, hour day were given the employes no, one could tell how.tl^e next election, was coining out,\'.and that there could, be by no possibility an increase before, next March, or probably later., Attention was called, too, to the, fact that the commission hitherto had, held that it could consider wage standards, in dealing* j with proposed rate, increases, although legislation by, Congress might remove that difficulty., The principal arguments against, the idea of a -permanent commission, , for the prevention or settlement of, strikes were that it would almost certainly, be fought by labor in Congress,, and that while President Wilson might, be entirely willing now to back such, legislation he might not bein a position, to do so when it was proposed., Representatives of the brotherhoods, who heard of this phase of the plan, were plainly against it. A counter, suggestion was heard among the, ^presidents that strike questions should, be left to the Interstate Commerce, Commission with power to investigate, and make a ppblic report of its findi, ings with the strike held in abeyance, \' ^ pending the investigation., The special committee\'s plan has, been tentatively accepted by the comw>;+4-.-v^, Ll 1 1A. XI-.\' "kx, luiucc ui cigni uuu iv was vne suDjecv, of today\'s conference at the White, House. Its substance was communicated, to the labor representatives, through Judge William L. Chambers,, of the Board of Mediation and Concilation., GERMANS EAT CROWS., As a result of the scarcity of meat, the Germans now literally "eat crow.", In the southern part of the empire, thousands of young crows \'are shot, in the forests and on the fifelds tknd, brought to\' the market of the cities., The formerly despised birds are ir, great demand. At first they wen, sold for 12 1-2 cents apiece, but now, they bring 25 cents.

One, of the best indications that the Muscovites, are emerging from the mazes, of mediaeval superstition is the, fact that they realize that Israelites, \' have rights they should respect., \' Many of this race who have recently, t left Russia and made their homes in, ; this country are bitter against the, I Muscovites from the fact that they, have been made footballs by them for, i centuries has K<>en stated.

Today it is worth $(J,572,<i47,1 (, and the firm frankly admits thac i T, advertising is responsible for it. \',, And yc\'t, some people who never; t, | made a success of anything they! j, undertook, will tell you that adver- j,, > \' tisinjj doesn\'t pay. The names of j, hundreds of concerns might be given |:, that have and are making advevrtis-: (, ing p&y and are building up a <, "splendid business through its aid. j, But that is not all of this story, j j, Atlanta, the home of Coca Cola, j,down, in Georgia, is noted as one j <, of the best cities in all the south-1 j, ern country. Why? Because ad- j, -\'vortising and boosting did it.

As a re., suit people have been attracted, there from outside who have established, new industries and the city, has grown and prospered., V This furnishes an example of one, of the ways in which a town may,, be built up and any other place can, win out just as our sister southern, city ha. done if its residents have, the will to do it., THE VERA CRUZ "WAR", ?, The Philadelphia Record calls atten-j, tion to the Republican orator who j, solemnly declared that the affair at ;, Vera Cruz in which 19 Americans and j, more than 190 Mexicans were killed,, was war; therefore Mr..

Consider what the affj, was., Mexican affronts to our officials, a, disregard of the rights of America, in Mexico, were so flagrant that wh, an officer and a boat\'s crew from, American man-of-war were arrest, in the streets of Tampico. Admii, Mayo decided that something had ?, to be done about it that all Mexica, would know. Huerta apologia, through diplomatic channels, but f, Mexicans would know anything abc, the diplomatic correspondence;, knew, or would soon know with eve, embellishment of Spanish rhetor:, of the affront to our flag; and the A, miral determined that the reparati, should be visible, even to Mexica, who can\'t read.He demanded the f<, mal salute of the Stars and Stripes, Now, suppose that the Wilson A, ministration had disavowed the c, mand and told Huerta that he nc, pay no attention to the Admiral; wh, would the Republicans have sa, about the indifference of a Democral, Administration to the national honoi, The Administration supported the d, mand of the Admiral, and any Admi, istration that had not done so wou, have been hooted out of power by tl, American people., Huerta did net salute the flag. Y<, cannot compel a man to do anythin, But you can punish him for not doii, it. Two heavy penalties fell up<, Huerta. We took Vera Cruz and o, cupied it for several months, and ?, Mexico knew that we had taken i, chief port because our flag had be<, insulted and the DroDer renarati\', had been refused. And a few montl, later Huerta found it necessary, abandon the country. The honor, the American flag was doubly vindi, ited., "THE TRANSFORMATION.", Rollin Kirby has a cartoon in, ecent issue of the New York Worl, vhich is labeled "The Transform;, ion".
