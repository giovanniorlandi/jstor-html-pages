The number of peo\nple present at the hearing was so\nlarge that they had to take the house\nchamber for the committee meeting.\nThe piincipal argument against the\nbill was that it destroyed home rule.\nThe bill is the one introduced by\nCarl Wallace of Minneapolis, W. H.\nPutnam of Red Wing and J. Dor\nsey of Glencoe, the committee which\nvisited Wisconsin and inquired about\nthe woi Kings of the public utilities\nlaw there\nSome of the speakers In arguing\nagainst the bill said that the railroad\ncommission, elected only to supervise\nthe railroads, knew nothing about\nother public utilities, could not under\nstand the problems the cities have\nbeen struggling with for years, and\nare not experts in this line. This\nbrought fiom Mr. Dorsey.the state\nment that although he was a Demo\ncrat hp would not be influenced by\nany slurs upon the railroad commis\nsion The commissioner had been\nelected by the people, and the people\nknow something about what they are\ndoing.\nJames Manahan, who had sat silent\nuntil this, came to his feet with an\nimpassionate reply, in which he\ncharged the lailroad commission wfth\nbeing unable to do Its present work.\nSays Bill Is Experimental.\nJ.

L. Wyler, manager of the Coli\nseum skating rink in this city, has\nreceived a letter from C. D. Billings\nof Crookston, in which the latter\nsuggests that there should be an\nother race skated between Al.\nThorpe, the Fargo skater, and Harry\nCarpenter, the Crookston "crack,"\nbecause of the unsatisfactory ending\nof the third and deciding race be\ntween the two skaters which was\nheld at Crookston last week.SI\nIn last week\'s race, Carpenter\nPHONE\nPIONEER:\neasily won, because of the fact that\none of Thorpe\'s skates brpke, at the\nend of the first mile, throwing\nThorpe so heavily that he was in\njured and rendered unable to finish\nthe contest. As each of the skaters\nhad won a previous race from the\nother, the Crookston race decided\nthe series.\nThere is a general demand for\nanother race between Thorpe and\nCarpenter, and an effort will be\nmade to have the boys skate another\nrace in this city.\nMany believe that Thorpe is\nCarpenter\'s superior, when luck\nbreaks even. Thorpe was leading\nCarpenter by about twenty five feet\nwhen his skate broke at Crookston,\nand his supporters are positive\nthat he would have won the race\nbut for the accident.\nManager Wyler is writing to\nMr. Billings suggesting a race in\nBemidji, and it is likely that Thorpe\nand Carpenter will get together\nagain. APPEALS FOR AID FOR\nSETTLERS\' CHILDREN\nMiss Anna E. Shetland Asks Legislative\nAid for Educating Children of Re\nmote Settlers.\nA recent issue of the Duluth\nNews-Tribune contains the followir\narticle of interest to people in our\nneighboring county on the north:\nSt. Paul, Minn Feb. 15.Anna\nE. Shelland of International Falls,\nsuperintendent of schools of Koochi\nching couuty, appeared before Stale\nupt. Schultz today to appeal for\nlegislative aid for the children of\nsettlers in that county, who are\nbereft _of school facilities. Com\nplaints had already reached the de\npartment that in one section children\nof the settlers were unable to secure\nschool facilities.\nMiss Shelland explained that\nthere are about sixty children\nscattered through unorganized town\nships in Koochiching county, that\ncannot go to school, because there\nare not sufficient funds available.\nThe county board levied a tax to\ncare for such children, but it did\nnot furnish enough money and the\nschools had to be abandoned.\nMiss Shelland suggested, and\nthe state superintendent^ approved\nthe idea, that the legislature ought\nto be asked to appropriate about\n$25,000 to provide education for\nthe children of the settlers, who\nmust stay upon their homesteads\nin order to get title from the gov\nernment, but who are so isolated\nthat the ordinary school arrange\nments will not reach them.\n& J**\nFORTY CENTS PER MONTH\nWILL BE FINEST BALL\nEVER GIVEN IN BEMIDJI\nCompany K\'s Second Annual Ball on\nWashington\'s Birthday Will Be Un\ndoubtedly Brilliant\nThe members of Company K, Be\nmidji\'s quota of the national guard,\nare making gala preparations for\ntheir second annual military ball\nwhich will be held next Monday\nevening in the city hall, and which\nwithout doubt will be the finest\nagair of its kind ever given in Be\nmidji.

But it will not take the\nfalse direction of ignoring these our\nprofoundest and holiest instincts. Mar\nriage for money may go, marriage for\nrank may go, marriage for position\nmay go, but marriage for love, I be\nlieve and trust, will last forever. Men\nin the future will probably feel that a\nunion with their cousins or near rela*\ntions is positively wicked that a union\nWith those too like them in person or\ndisposition is at least undesirable that\na union based upon considerations of\nwealth or any other consideration save\nconsiderations of immediate natural\nimpulse is base and disgraceful. But\nto the end of time they will continue to\nfeel in spite of doctrinaires that the\nvoice of nature is better far than the\nvoice of the lord chancellor or the\neoyal society and that the instinctive\ndesire for a particular helpmate is a\nsurer guide for the ultimate happiness\nboth of the race and of the individual\nthan any amount of deliberate consul\ntation. It is not the foolish fancies of\nyouth that will have to be got rid of,\nbut the foolish, wicked and mischie\nvous interference of parents or out\nsiders.Grant Allen.\nKnew the Sound of Wood.\nThere was an argument on a cricket\nfield in a village near Nottingham,\nEngland, which interrupted the game\nfor some time. The match was being\nplayed between the local tradesmen\nof the village. All went well until\nthe bowler, who was the village con\nstable, a man over six feet tall, sent a\nball which bumped up from the\nground and hit the village butcher,\nwho was batting and who was ex\nceedingly fat and perspiring freely, on\nthe head. The wicket keeper, a re\nmarkably thin and agile man, who\nwas the village grocer, caught the ball\nand yelled, \'Ow\'s that?"\n"Hout!" shouted the village baker,\nwho possessed only one eye.\n"Hi say now!" roared-the fat butch\ner, who refused to have it so. "But\nbit \'it me on the \'ead."\n"Hi don\'t know where hit \'it you,"\nresponded the umpire, who was the\nvillage undertaker, "but Hi knows the\nsound of wood when Hi \'ears hit, so\nhout you go."\nThe Tricksters.,\n"Political tricksters always give\nthemselves away," said a congress\nman. "Their methods remind me of\nthe two men who wanted to sell their\ncorpses for dissection. These two men,\nmiserably clad, called on the dean of\na medical collage in New York.\n\'We are both on the verge of star\nvation,, sir,\' the spokesman said. \'We\nare well on in years, and it is clear\nthat we haven\'t much longer to live.\nWould you care to purchase our bodies\nfor your dissecting room?\'\n"The dean hesitated.\n\'It is an odd proposition,\' he mut\ntered.\n"\'But it is occasionally done,\' said\nthe spokesman in an eager voice.\n\'Well,\' said the dean, \'we might\narrange it.

"Pirates board people, you know,\nand I expect your father, if my plans\nwork all right, to eventually board me."\n"Oh, how clever you are, George!\nDo you know, I was awfully afraid\nyou were going to get off that ancient\nchestnut about his being such an old\nfreebooter, and I\'m so glad you didn\'t,\nbecause all the fellows I\'ve had have\nsaid that, and I was longing for some\nthing new."\nA Natural Cross.\nOne of the most beautiful natural\nrock carvings in the world is the\nSouthern Cross, on the island of Grand\nManan, in the bay of Fundy. It\nstands at the head of a ledge of rocks\nJutting into the,.bay from the foot of\none of the immense cliffs at the south\nern end Of the Grand Manan.

""____\nManaging Small Sailboats.\nIt is quite a trick to lower a main\nsail properly. In the first place,\\]}e\nhoops should be just large enough\nnot so large, however, that the sail\ndoes not set close to the mast. Lower\nthe throat first and follow it with the\npeak. If the peak is dropped first,\nsays a writer in Country Life In Amer\nica, the sail will not come down. It\ngoes without saying that the sail must\nbe shaken when you want to lower\nit. To lower a centerboard when un\nder way put the helm up and keep the\nboat off. A small boat can be stop\nped by putting the helm up and down\nacross the boat quickly. This is use\nful in coming up to a dock or moor\ning. A boat can be got out of stays\nby dropping her peak and then hoist\ning it when she is under way. An\nother way is to put the helm down,\nslack the main sheet and let her drift\nback then trim her quickly and she\nwill sail away. Always go to the lee\nside of a dock. When a boat is towed\nmake sure that it has a good painter,\nespecially at night.\nCandor.\nThe colonel had remonstrated vigor\nously with Uncle Eph about the old\ndarky\'s persistent excursions into the\nstate of inebriation.

This is especially true as\nlegards England, whose former prefer\nence for Mediterranean oranges is being\nrapidly supplanted by the more perfect\nseedless California variety now produced\nby the Caiforma Fruit Growers\' Exchange\nThe transition in the tastes of our Brit\nish friends has been gradual, but it Is\ndefinite, and they are -finding particular\nsatisfaction in the new crop of "Sunkist"\noranges, which indicates that they have\nreached a final conclusion as to the fa\nvorable conditions prevailing in the 5,000\norchards of the California Exchange. The\ntendency in this direction was realized\nsome time ago and a London branch of\nfice was opened to facilitate the distri\nbution of \'\'Sunkist" oranges.\nThe First Cookbook.\nTo the Romans belong the honor of\nhaving produced the first European\ncookery book, and, though the author\nship is uncertain, It is generally attrib\nuted to Caelius Apicus, who .lived un\nder Trajan, 114 A. D. Here are two\nrecipes from this ancient collection:\n"First, for a sauce to be eaten with\nboiled fowl, put the following ingredi\nents into a mortar: Aniseed, dried mint\nand lazer root. Cover them with vine\ngar, add dates and pour In liquamen\n(a distilled liquor made from large fish\nwhich were salted and allowed to turn\nputrid in the sun), oil and a small\nquantity of mustard seeds. Reduce all\nto a proper thickness with sweet wine\nwarmed, and then pour this same over\nyour chicken, which should previously\nbe boiled in aniseed water."\nThe-second recipe shows the same\nqueer mixture of ingredients: "Take\na wheelbarrow of rose leaves and\npound in a mortar add to it brains of\ntwo pigs and two thrushes boiled and\nmixed with the chopped up yoke of\negg, oil, vinegar, pepper and wine.\nMix and pour these together and \'stew\nthem steadily and slowly till the per\nfume is developed."Chambers\' Jour\nnal.\nWhich Foot Walks Faster?\nYou may think this a very silly ques\ntion to ask,-but it isn\'t. It is a simple,\ndemonstrable fact, which you can\nprove to your own satisfaction in a\nvery few minutes. If you will take a\npavement that is clear, so that there\nwill be no Interference, and walk brisk\nly in the center, you will find that be\nfore you have gone fifty yards you\nveered very much to one side.\nYou must not make any effort, of\ncourse, to keep in the center, but if you\nwill think of something and endeavor\nto walk naturally you" cannot keep a\ndirect line. The explanation of this lies\nIn the propensity of one foot to walk\nfaster than the other, or one leg takes\nlonger stride than the other, causing\none to walk to one side. You can try\nan experiment In this way by placing\ntwo sticks about eight feet apart, then\nstand off about sixty feet, blindfold\nyourself and endeavor to walk between\nthem. You will find it almost impos\nsible.\nWhy Not Be an Egotist?\nThere is much mistaken sentiment as\nto the sin of egotism. The fact is ego\ntism Is not a sin. On the other hand,\nit is somewhat of a virtue and an in\ndispensable element in all real prog\nress. Some phases of egotism are un\npleasant to the beholder and unfor\ntunate for the possessor, but if all of\nself love, or, rather, the love of other\npeople\'s admiration and good will, were\nto be extinguished there would be little\nto hold society together and less to\ngive impetus to the great enterprises\nwhich spring from individual thought\nand culminate In personal profit.Les\nlie\'s Weekly.\nThe Retort Courteous\nA lady passing through the negro\nquarter in Mobile, Ala., heard an old\nwoman chanting a dirgelike tune:\n"Auntie," she observed, "that is a\nmournful song you are singing."\n"Yassum,** was the response, *\'I\nknows It\'s mo\'nful, but by- singln\' dat\nsong an\' \'tendin* to my own business\nI spects to git to heaben." -i\nExpected Some Cussing.\nA West Philadelphia husband had\njust comfortably seated himself for\nhis after dinner cigar the other even\ning when his good wife arose and took\nthe parrot from the room. This done,\nshe picked up a couple of envelopes\nand approached the olcV man, all of\nwhich occasioned that gent consider\nable surprise.\n"Mary," said he, "what in the world\ndid you take" that parrot out of the\nroom for?"\n"I was afraid that you .might set\nhim a bad example," answered wifey\n"What do you mean?" demanded the\nwondering husband.\n"I mean," answered wifey, handing\nfather the envelope, "that I have just\nreceived my dressmaking and millinery\nbills."Philadelphia Telegraph.\nW^\'i^ Followed 8uit.\nz?\nst y*\n\'*&.*\nOn the day of the admission of M.\nRostand to the French academy the\nauthor of "Cyrano" and "L\'Aiglon"\ngave a breakfast to a few of bis\nfriends, the guest of jhonor being Mme.\nBernhardt. The actress was dressed In\na handsome gown, which had been\nmade expressly for the occasion. At\nthe end of the breakfast she arose and\nIn an impressive manner took a glass,\nheld it high and said, "I drink to the\ngreatest of French dramatists, M. Ro\nstand, and I drink after the Greek\nmanner!" She then poured the con\ntents of her glass over her head and\ngown.\nTwo of Rostand\'s small sons- were\nsitting at a side table wearing new\nvelvet suits, also made for the occa\nsion. In the silence which followed\nBernhardt dramatic tribute the elder\nof the boys arose-and, imitating her\nmanner, said, "I drink to the greatest\nof poets,^ my papa, and I also drink in\nthe Greek fashion!" and straightway\ndeluged himself and his small brother\nwith the contents of his glass.\nA Scene" Not In a Play.\nAn extraordinary scene took place In\nthe Princess\' theater, London, on the\nnight of the first production of Charles\nReade\'s great play," "Never Too Late\nto Mend," Oct. 4, 1865. During the\nprison scene a large quantity of water\nwas thrown over Miss Moore, who took\nthe part of Josephs, the character done\nto death by the warders. One of the\ncritics, Mr. Tomlin of the Morning Ad\nvertiser, rose from his seat and pub\nlicly protested against the unnecessary\ncruelty. This aroused almost a riot\namong the audience, and the action of\nthe play was stopped for some con\nsiderable time. Fuel was added to the\nfire by George Vining, the lessee of the\ntheater, who was playing the part of\nTom Robinson and Who made a most\nimprudent speech, in which he prac\ntically insulted every critic present,\nwith the result that the theater was\nleft severely alone by the press for\nmany months. The play, however,\nturned out to be a popular success\nand had, for those days, the phenom\nenal run of 140 performances.\nAsked Too Much.\nIn R. F. Johnson\'s book, "From Pe:\nkin to Mandalay," the author teils the\nstory of a poor Chinese scholar noted\nfor his piety, who heard the voice of\nan invisible being who spoke to him\nthus: "Your piety has found favor in\nthe sight of heaven. Ask now for\nwhat you most .long to possess, for I\nam the messenger of the gods, and\nthey have swxr to grant your heart\'s\ndesire." "I ask," said the poor scholar,\n"for the coarsest clothes and food, just\nenough for my daily wants, and I beg\nthat I may have freedom to wander at\nmy will over mountain and fell and\nwoodland stream, free from all world\nly cares, till my life,\'s~end.\nThat is all\nI ask." Hardly had he spoken than\nthe sky seemed to be filled with the\nlaughter of myriads of unearthly\nvoices. "All you ask," cried the mes\nsenger of the gods. "Know you not\nthat what you demanded is the high\nest happiness of the beings that dwell\nIn heaven? Ask for wealth or rank\nor what earthly happiness you will,\nbut not for you are the holiest joys -of\nthe gods."\nThe Ungrateful Cuckoo.\nTo hear the cuckoo\'s cheery note you\nmight think he had the clearest con\nscience in the world. He can have nei\nther memory nor moral sense or he\nwould not carry it off so gayly. We\nsay nothing of the "raptores," who are\na race apart, but the most disreputable\nof birds, as a rule, are guilty of noth\ning worse than peccadillos. The jack\ndaw will steal for the mere fun of the\nthing, for he can make no possible use\nof plate or jewelry, and sometimes un\nder temptation may make a snatch at\na pheasant chick. ^_ Sparrows are, of\ncourse, notorious thieves, but they rank\nno higher in crime-than the sneaking\'\npickpockets.

As to the Gatun\ndam itself they show that not only is\nthe dam safe, but that on the whole\nthe plan already adopted would make\nit needlessly high and strong and ac\ncordingly they recommend that the\nheight be reduced by twenty feet,\nwhich change in the plans I have ac\ncordmgly directed."\nPresident Roosevelt says that the\nengineers who made the report "are\nof all the men in their profession,\nwithin or without the United States,\nthe men who are on the whole best\nqualified t^o pass upon these very\nquestions which they examined."\nReport of the Engineers.\nThe engineers report that, as the\nGatun earth dam was the central\npoint of discussion, they gave it, un\nder instructions from Mr. Taft, "first\nconsideration in the light of all new\nevidence" and they add that "the type\nof dam now under construction is one\nwhich meets~with our unanimous ap\nproval." They say they are "satisfied\nthat there will be no dangerous or ob\njectionable seepage through the mate\nrials under the base of the dam nor\nare they so soft as to be liable to be\npushed aside by the weight of the pro\nposed dam so as to cause dangerous\nsettlement. We are also satisfied that\nthe materials available and which it\nis proposed to use ate suitable and\ncan be readily placed to form a tight,\nstable and permanent dam."\nDams and locks, lock gates and all\nother engineering stiuctures involved\nin the lock canal project are "feasible\nand safe," according to the engineers,\n"and they can be depended upon to\nperform With certainty their respec\ntive functions." They report that they\n"do not find any occasion for chang\ning the type of canal that has been\nadopted. A change to a sea level\nplan at the present time would add\ngreatly to the cost and time of con\nstruction, without compensating ad\nvantages, either in capacity of the\ncanal or in safety of navigation, and\nhence would be a public misfortune."\nTheir estimate of the complete cost\nof the canal is $360,000,000.\nEXTRA SESSION MARCH 15\nTaft Announces Date of Meeting of\nCongress.\nWashington, Feb. 18.The extra\nsession of congress will be convened\non March 15 This date has been\ndefinitely settled and President-Elect\nTaft authorized the announcement.\nFormal announcement of the date\nwas made by Republican Floor Lead\ner Payne for the information of the\nhouse.
