It was so ter- i, rible that I. who have watched my, comrades fall around me almost with, indifference, sudder as my memory, recalls those scenes., "As their battalions advanced upon, us they were in serried masses, by, files of 20. The shrapnel from our, 75.millimeter guns and the project, lies lrom our heavy artillery icll, among them, find you could sec the, great gaps, as if a mower had passed, with a scylhe. Then high explosive i, shells which burst on contact fell,;, and limbs shot into the air. We were!, so close that pieces of their torn flesh !, fell among us. Eventually we reached, Moncourt. and took shelter\' for a, time in a wood. Althought it was, 3 o\'clock in the morning, the bursting, shells made it as clear as day., giving the battlefield the aspect of a, fairy scene., "From behind the french artillery, fired into the German masses, the, German shells flying over our heads j, toward the Douaumont section.

In no other respect4was, the cider section of the Mapp hill, changed. The testimony of cidci, manufacturers hefoie the House commitee, was to the effect that cidei, often contains more than one-half ol, 1 per cent of alcohol when it leav., es the press, and that it would be, next to impossible to hold the percentage, of alcohol to this minimum, under ordinary conditions without, the use of preservatives., Senator Mapp and Senator CValker,, both patrons of the prohibition bill,, addressed the committee at length, on the Gordon amendment providing, for the enforcement of the prohibition, law by the Attorney-General, Senator Mapp repeated the argument, against the plan that he made before, the committee Monday night, while, senator ?uikct g?ivc it ma mj <mi^, indorsement. 1IC was one of the leaders, in the unsuccessful Senate fight, for the adoption of the Conrad amendment, looking to the same end., Richmond, March 1?Delegate Page, of Albermarle yesterday offered a resolution, in the House directing the, State Accountant to examine the hook, of the State Auditor and the State, Treasurer and report upon the condition, of the treasury.

The, point was made that if the Attorney, I General were made ex olhcio moral, welfare commissioner the Anti-Saloon, League and the liquor question would, be thrown into politics. The. other J, amendment was oppuseu ucuunc . ,, was said to l?e impracticable., One or two other amendments,,, principally to protect the cider indus- i, try. were also considered.

March 1.?RestTlts of, the new Austro-German submarine, campaign against armed merchant, ships of the Entente Allies beginn., ing last midnight are awaited by the, United States with grave concern., Although under their new instructions,, Teutonic naval commanders, arc authorized to sink without warn,, ing all armed enemy merchantmen, they encounter, it is understood they, have been told to make sure if possible, that no American citizens are, aboard any ship attacked. Furthermore,, in the latest communication regarding, submarine warfare, Ger., many lias assured the United States, that the new orders are so formulated, as to prevent the destruction, of enemy liners, \'"on account of their, armament unless such armament is, proved.", . The attitude of the United States, r>ivni-nmi>nt toward Lh.? new policy of, Germany anil Austria has not been, definitely determined. President Wilson, yesterday discussed the subject, in. a conference with Secretary Lansing, and then laid the German communication, before his cabinet. Later, it was said that because the all-important, appendices to the German, memorandum had been delayed in, transit the State Mepartment thus, far was unable to determine whether, claims set. forward by Germany and, Austria in justification of their course, were sustained., Moreover, it has not yet been decided, whether the reiterated assurnnciN, rc-ardinir the future conduct of, submarine warfare, contained - in the, Gdrmaiv note, are of a character, broad enough to warrant acceptance, of the fierman proposal to settle the, issues growing out of the sinking, of the Luistania. A decision in that, connection may be made within a, few days, and the State Department, today probably will take steps to, determine what-has become of the, (nitssing appendices, which wore, started in the mails from Berlin, nearly thre(. weeks ago., Meanwhile, if any American citizen, is injured during the attack by, a submarine on \'a merchant ship, which does not and has no intention, of using its armament otherwise than, defensively, a grave situation will, arise., The United States stands at this, time, as it has always done, foj* the, right of American citizens to travel, with safety on defensively, armed, ships. If the German-\'eontentions?:?nj, sustained, however, and it is proved, n cUin unnn, ITUUIIUSM vcijr \'mi.VM, an American may lie injured used, defensive armament for purposes of, offense, it is considered unlikely that, this Government will take any action., Tt never has contended that ships, committing attacks or other offensive, acts or under orders to so conduct ., themselves are immune from sum., mary destruction., n, TRAPPED BOY TRIES TO KILL., Lebanon.

", absolutely closed to peace. We can 7, etill continue the conversation, it, would seem, in a more agreeable tone ;, and in a plcasanter frame of mind., The essential, the vital point, so far, as this country is concerned, is to find, an honorable basis 011 which we can.1, preserve the peace. That has been the, guilding principal of Mr. Wilson\'s, foreign policy from the beginning. *\', and for that he has been reviled and, reproached "by all the evtremists in \', the United States, and very recently I, * \' \' \', has been made tor a is t-auai- m-., \' ject of a formidable indictment by 1, Mr. Root. Jf he had been looking for war., he could have found a score, of occasions which would have justi. 1, lied him from the Root and Roosevelt, standpoint in putting the country, into a hostile position. But his, crime has been, according to the Re. j, publican and Progressive code, that, he has been seeking earnestly for, : peace, even when peace seemed impos-\', siblc. and that he has been willing, to sacrifice, everything hut honor and ;, right for that paramount object., As has been suggested, what the, Ccnnan reply admits or promises can, only be stated authoritatively by the, %, blate Department. After all, no mat., ter what is said by diplomacy the, last word will be said by the submarine., and us long as the war con, tinues Wf cannot expert to eliminate, the submarine ;u controversial factor., (At;!::y t.y virtually agree, in principi v;? demand,, but the tiii.ii [ : will come, not on, paper, but . . j? .

The future still will!, contain its dangers, but it will be an j, inter-national blessing if this pres. j, ent peril can be avoided. "Sufficient j, unto the day is the evil thereof." All, we can do is to provide for the present, and to trust that any settlement, which may be agreed upon may prove, more than a scrap of paper. If Mr., Wilson succeeds in discovering a, peaceable way out of the difficulty, consistent with national honor, he I, will have furnished a new claim to J, public confidence and support. It j, need not trouble him that lie again ;, may be donounced by the Roots and ;, Rooscvelts for his failure to play the, part of an international swash- i, buckler. !, 0, THE KAISER IS, STAKING ALL., Lord Sydenham, who is recogniz- j, ed as one of England\'s greatest au-\'!, thorities on military questions has j i, prepared an article dealing with re- : ;, cent developments in the theatres of j \', war which are culminating in the bat- J, tie of Verdun. Among other things lie, says: _ I\', The German people arc beginning \', to question the wisdom of the creators, of the war and the veracity of official; j, assurances. There is now a reai and j, earnest craving for peace which finds, expression in frequent suggestions of. \', terms which a year ago would have I 1, been scouted. Unless some great!\', change occurs the stage will soon bo;, reached at which the moderation of t, :he German government will be wide-!, !y proclaimed, in order that all blame - ?, for continuing the war may be 3, :hrown unon the Allies. | s, In such conditions there was a 1, strong probability that some great ef-;, "ort would be made in the west, and, trtcr several local attacks on vari- (, >us points of the Allies line, the tremendous, movement on Verdun was be- 1, run. c, If the great venture north of Ver- d, lun proves only a local gain cf ground \\, it heavy cost. then, on the balance, it f, ivill not lie far removed from disas:er,<, \'n the nineteen months of war Gor- ;, 11:1:1 strength has been materially re- e, luced, but not broken. The allies bar! c, 1 long leeway to bo fully provided [, with munitions. They stand \'more ,, han ever united and determined that,, Europe shall be secured against fu, urc outbursts of the furor Teuton- c, cms, and that the wrongs of small ?, States shall be righted. The war can, lave only one end, and the determining, factor may be the awakening of, he German people, who cannot be in- 1, infinitely deceived and who are al- S, endy beginning: to think for them- n, selves., 0 1, THE VERDUN DRIVE *, (Baltimore- American). 1, t, It now appears as though the tier- j:, nans have about concluded that they r, an not batter down the Verdun, \'orts unless at the same time they1 I, >atier down all their powers of of-; t, ense. They would then bo left with; t, . victory that could not be matured. c, t is a cause for wonder that the, -Caiscr should have directed thai awl:, 1 massacre of the flower of his ar- \', ny.
