        <pre>['THE EUREKA 8! \\TINEJL\nESTABLISHED 1870. EUREKA, NEVADA, MONDAY, APRIL 13. 1908. PUBLISHED M0NDAY8.\nHow to Thaw Dynamite\nAlthough knowledge of the kind indicated in this title will do\nlittle good to the average man. lack of it, or indifference to its value,\ncosts many lives yearly. Chilled or frozen nitroglycerine loses much\nof its explosivo force and it becomes necessary to warm it. In do\ning this improperly the explosive may be set off, with disastrous\nconsequences. In a recent paper by P. N. Dennison, of the Du\nPont Powder Company, abstracted in Engineering and Contracting\n(Chicago, March 11), it is stated that in a single year GG accidents\nhave been reported from this cause in the United States—nearly as\nmany as Great Britain has had in 34 years. Mr. Dennison gives\nthe following list, taken from a British government report of acci\ndents, between 1872 and 190G. Every method mentioned is con\ntrary to law in England :\n“(1) Heating over fire, 38; (2) reheating water in which dyna\nmite had been previously placed to thaw, 11 ; (3) placing the explo\nsives in water, then heating that over a fire, 10 ; (4) placing the dy\nnamite cartridges in ovens, 8; (5) thawing cartridges in the hands\nover a lighted lamp or candle, 7 ; (6) placing dynamite in hot ashes,\n7; (7) warming on a shovel over a fire, 5; (8) placing cartridges on\ntop of heated stone, 5 ; (9) on a hot iron, 4; (10) on a steam pipe,\n2; (11) rubbing cartridges together to warm them by friction, 1 ”\nThis will do as a somewhat comprehensive catalogue of “dont’s.”\nHow then should dynamito be thawed out? We are told :\n“For thawing large quantities of dynamite, a thaw-house heated\nby hot water pipes, the radiators being in the back or sides of the\nbuilding and protected by a wooded partition, is by far the saf* st\nmethod. If it is arranged that the cartridges may be laid out\non grooved shelves, each stick by itself, so much the better, for each\nwill then obtain a uniform and regular heat and insure the best\nresults.\n• [The house should be so] constructed that a inau could not\nget in on the explosive side at all, the door to open directly on the\ndynamite shelves. A door in the rear would enable a man to make\nnecessary repairs on the radiators. This for the reason that many\naccidents have occurred due to the blaster stopping in a nice warm\nthawing-houso to insert his caps or make up primers.\n“A stove in the middle of the room may bring trouble. One\nease in Pennsylvania and one iu Knnsas are recorded where thaw\ning-houses heated by this method exploded. Both went up in the\nnight when no one was near."\nFor small quantities Mr. Dennison recommends the use of two\nbuckets of different sizes, the smaller to be placed within the larger\nand covered with rags or anything that will hold the heat. This is\nperfectly safe, the dynamite is in the best of shape, and much of its\nexplosive force is saved. It can be carried to the shot and loaded\ndirect, there by minimizing the chances of being chilled. He adds:\n“There are thawing kettles on the market, built on much the\nsame plan, which can be purchased from any explosive manufacturer.\nFor somewhat larger quantities, use a barrel for the hot water and\na milk-can for the dynamite.\n“Manure makes a good thawer where the quarry is so situated\nthat a supply can be kept up. The contractors on the New\nYork subway work used this method generally, burying a box suffi\ncient to hold three or four cases of dynamite in manure, then dug\nit out when needed. Opinion there seemed to give manure a life of\ntwo or three weeks only.”\nState News From Our Exchanges\nCleveland H. Baker, who has\nbeen deputy District Attorney of\nNye County for about a year, has\nresigned that position and will\nopen up a law offiee in Tonopah.\nA new paper to be called the\nDaily American will be launched\nin Reno shortly. Fred Brown,\nformerly of the Nevada City\nTranscript, is at the head of the\nnew paper.\nEnsign James P.

The regular trains are\nable to handle the business.\nIn a row over a town lot at\nSchurz the other day, A. McKel\nligon, a saloon keeper, emptied a\nshotgun into a blacksmith named\nHarris, killing him instantly.\nWitnesses state that it was a cold\nblooded murder. Kelligon is now\nin jail at Rawhide.\nGeneral manager E. J. Nally of\nthe Postal Telegraph and Cable\nCompany has made arrangements\nwith the Southern Nevada Tele\ngraph and Telephoue Company\nto use the lines of the latter com\npany in southern Nevada, and has\nclosed a contract with local con\ntractors to construct other lines\nfor the Postal Company in Neva\nda. Manager Nally says the\nPostal Telegraph Company will\nfollow the line of the Sante Fe\nRailrord to Rhyolite, and from\nthat point will later extend lines\ninto all portions of Nevada and\ncompete with the Western Union.\nAt Goldfield on April 4 Local\nNo. 220 of the Western Federa\ntion of Miners, by a vote 90 to 25,\ndeclared off the strike and will\nreturn to work beside non-Union\nmen, but demand the Tonopah\nscale, 50 cents a day less than\ntheir former wages.\nThe State police under Captain\nCox are doing good work at Raw\nhide. They have disarmed about\na third of the men in the camp\nand have enough guns in their\npossession to start a South Amer\nican revolution. The police are\ninsisting on good order and clean\nliness in the camp.\nErnest Bingham, one of the\nformer proprietors of the Reno\nJournal, while endeavoring to\nboard one of the street cars in\nLos Angeles Tuesday, was thrown\nto the ground, partly under the\ncar. He sustained a fracture of\nthe left leg above the knee and\nseveral minor bruises.\nThe Colorado company which\nowns the Nugget mining claim in\nOlinghouse canyon has been for\nsome time experimenting with\ndry washers on the property and\nhave met with such substantial\nresults that within a short time\ntwo 50-ton machines will be taken\nto the property for the purpose of\nextracting values from the ore.\nWith the statement to a friend,\nEd Uren, that he was tired of liv\ning, Edward L. Gilman, expert\naccountant for the Tonopah\nUnited Water Company, and one\nof the moat popular young men\nof Tonopah, swallowed morphine\ntablets and ended his existence\nin the company’s office Thursday\nevening. Uren thought Gilman\nwas joking and paid no attention\nto his threat to end his existence\nGilman\'s accounts were in per\nfect order and no cause is known\n• foi the deed. He was 37 years\nof age and leaves a young wife.\nThe Goldfield correspondent of\nthe Rhyolite Bulletin says that\npeople are leaving Rawhide in\ndroves and bunches so big that\nthey are falling over each other\nin their anxiety to get out. Other\nreports from Rawhide say that\nthe camp continues to boom and\nthat prospects are better than\never. Somebody must be lying\nlike sixty about Rawhide.\n“The Reception” lodging house\non First street, within half a\nblock of the Rono police station,\nwas entered by burglars Thurs\nday night and more that $3000\nworth of diamonds belonging to\nIda Robbins, the owner, were\nstolen. The police have arrested\nFred Johnson, husband of the\ncolored housekeeper, and “Bill”\nWentworth, a bartender.\nMiss Jessie Keenroy, the young\nwoman who assisted in horse\nwhipping Rev. J. M. Hilbish, the\nMethodist minister at Turlock,\nCal., Wednesday, was formerly a\nwaitress in the Riverside Hotel\nin Reno. While there she gained\nconsiderable notoriety. She fre\nquented the back rooms of vari\nous saloons and on one occasion\nhad some trouble in a saloon\nknown as the “Turf,” where\nwomen were employed to sing\nfor the entertainment of the male\ncustomers of the place.\nA new find of ore at what has\nbeen in past years known as the\nRichmond district, northwest of\nCarlin, Elko County, about 15\nmiles has been reported. The\nmineral zone at this point runs\nnortheast\' and southwest from\nTuscarora, through Gold Circle,\nsouthwesterly past Maggie Creek,\nand across the Humboldt river\nwest of Carlin and east of Pali\nsade. In this big trend several\ngood mines have been developed\nand the latest fiud shows a good\nledge of gold and silver ore.\nThe prison board held a meet\ning last week and increased the\nsalaries of the employes at the\nNevada State prison.

In 1872 a national ticket was nomi\nnated, James Black of Pennsylvania being the candidate for president.\nMr. Black received 5,608 votes.\nWhat is the largest vote ever polled by the Prohibitionists ?\nThat of 1892, when John Bidwell of California received 264,133\nvotes for president.\nName the Prohibition presidential candidates since James Black.\nGreen Clay Smith, Kentucky, 1876; Neal Dow, Maine, 1880;\nJohn P.

Swallow, Pennsylvania,\n1904.\nWhat was Swallow’s vote f\n258,536. This was an increase of 50,000 over Woolley’s vote.\nState briefly what the Prohibition party chiefly stands for.\nThe following is a part of the Prohibition platform of 1892: “The\nliquor traffic is a foe to civilization, the arch enemy of popular gov\nernment and a public nuisance. It is the citadel of the forces that\ncorrupt politics, promote poverty and crime, degrade the nation’s\nhome life, thwart the will of the people and deliver our country into\nthe hands of rapacious class interests. All laws that under the guise\nof regulation legalize and protect this traffic or make the government\nshare in its ill gotten gains are ‘vicious in principle and powerless as\na remedy.’ We declare anew for the entire suppression of the manu\nfacture, sale, importation, exportation and transportation of alcoholic\nliquors as a beverage by federal and state legislation.”\nGeneral News Summary\nJohn S. Leech of Illinois, now public printer in the Philippines,\nhas been appointed public printer at Washington, D. C.\nAs a result of numerous complaints of postals and post-cards\nbeing defaced by the postmarking, the Postmaster-General has or\ndered discontinuance of postmarking cards at the office of address.\nThe postal card fad has reached an enormous proportion and the\nnew ruling is expected by the postal officials to be received with de\nlight by the thousands of collectors.\nJohn W. Mitchell, former president of the United Mine Work\ners of America, called on President Roosevelt Saturday, and upon\nleaving the “White House said the President had offered him the\nposition of Special Commissioner to study and report upon the labor\nconditions in the Panama oanal zone. Mr. Mitchell said he was un\nable to accept the offer on account of ill health.\nThe Nebraska delegation which bolted the Populist convention\nat St Louis, has issued a statement in explanation of their action.\nThey declare the old-time Populists mostly were absent, and that\nthe management of the gathering showed a total disregard of par\nliamentary usage and right accredited to the delegates. They allege\nthat the apportionment of delegates was made so as to give control\nof the convention to delegates from States that never cast a Populist\nvote. The statement further says: “We believe the whole thing\nwas financed by a man or men who have organized an Independence\nleague, hoping thereby to effect the downfall of both Bryan and\nWatson.”\nThree Man Wine.\nThe best Rhenish wine is scarcely\nplentiful enough to furnish an average\nof one drink for every three German*.\nThe worst, on the contrary. Is so bad\nthat It takes three nlfen to get one drink\ndown Its natural channel. Near Got\ntingen is the little town called Wlt\nzenhausen, which has long been fa\nmous, or, rather, Infamous, for a kind\nof wine known as the "drelmanner\nwein," because It requires one man to\ndrink It, a second to hold him and a\nthird to pour it down bis throat Here\nalso is located Germany’s first and\nonly colonial school, founded by some\nwealthy adherents of the colonial pol\nicy on which Emperor William has Just j\nwon a victory over the Socialists In the\nrelchstag. The school was opened In\n18U9, with room for seventy students,\nwhich 1* not nearly enough for all who\napply. A special feature Is the segre\ngation of the students In dormitories\nto keep them out of taverns, ns It Is\nwell known that nothli& Is so disas\ntrous to the whites In the tropics as\n“tropenholler,’’ from habits of alcoholic\nIndulgence. Here 1* where the “three\nman wine” helps the temperance cause.\n—New York World.\nDreaming a Darby Winner.\nI dare say that every year one or\nmore people dream of the Derby win\nner, because thousands of people are\nguessing In their dreams, and two or\nthree guess right. Take the Favonius\ncase. A man came to an acquaintance\nof mine and said, "What Is the Latin\nfor the southwest wind?” “Favonius,”\nsaid my friend. “That’s the name,”\nsaid the other. “I dreamed last night\nthat Favonius won the Derby, but I\ncould onfy remember that southwest\nwind was the English of the word\nwhen I awoke.” There was no Fa\nvoil! us In the list of horses, but on\nreaching the race course the men\nfound that "the Zephyr colt” had been\nnewly named — Favonius. Probably\nthe name Zephyr (west wind) colt bad\nbeen converted Into Favonius (south\nwest wind) In the sleeping mind of the\ndreamer, though when awake he could\nnot rememtier the Latin word for\nsouthwest wind. Favonius won. The\ndream was a good guess, no more.—\nAndrew Lang In Independent\nrnslslu Egotism.\nHusband (during the spat)—l must\nhave been a fool when 1 married you.\nWife—Undoubtedly.

With the message\nhe transmitted a report reviewing the\nlegal phases of the question by At\ntorney-General Bonaparte:\n•• I herewith submit a letter from the\nDepartment of Justice, which explains\nltaelf. Under this opinion I hold that\nexisting statutes give the President\npower to prohibit the Postmaster-Gen\neral from being used as an instrument\nin the commission of crime; that is, to\nprohibit the use of the mail for the j\nadvocacy of murder, arson and treason;\nand I shall act upon such construction.\n“Unquestionably, however, there\nshould be further legislation by Con\ngress in this matter. When compared\nwith the suppression of anarohy, every\nother other question sinks into in\nsignificance. The anarchist is the\nenemy of humanity, the enemy of all\nmankind, and bis is a deeper degree of\ncriminality than any other. No immi\ngrant is allowed to come to our shores\nif he is an anarchist; and no paper pub\nlished here or abroad should be per\nmitted circulation in this country if it\npropagates anarchistic opinions.”\nJ.

MoCHARLKS, County Treasurer.\nSAVES ALL TbE LEAD VALUES\nBag House Arrangement Makes\nPossible the Recovery of All\nMetals in Ores\nAccording to spectators who listened\nto the arguments in the smelter fume\ncase before Judge Marshall at Salt Lake\nCity April 1. says the Herald, mine\nowners aud operators could have\nlearned something they ought to know\nhad they been there. In explaining to\nthe court what changes had been\nbrought about by the bag house system\nof controlling fumes, gases, etc., one of\nthe lawyers made the unqualified state\nmout that not a particle of suspended\nmatter in the smoke aud fumes was al\nlowed to escape.\n“We save every particle of the ar\nsenic,” the lawyer is reported to have\nsaid, "and we save all the sulphur and\nall the lead.”\nThe Herald continuing says: If the\nUnited States Company saves “all the\nlead” through the operation of its bag\nhouse, it is only fair to presume that\nthe Ameiicau Compauy also "saves all\nthe lead” in the ores treated at its Mur\nray piaut, ns all the fumes aud smoke\ngo through a bag house there, just as\nthey do at the United States Company’s\nworks.\nThe producer has always been told\nthat the reason why the smelting com\npany only settles for 90 per cent of the\nlead coutained in ore is because there\'is\na loss of that much through volatiliza\ntion—that much goes off in the fumes.\nGranting that the lawyer told the trutli\nwhen he said all the lead was saved\nthrough the operatiou of the bag house\nsystem of controlling fumes, aud there\nis no doubt that he did, why should the\nsmelters louger insist on cuttiug out 200\npounds of lead contained in every ton\ncarried in the ores bought?\nIf all of the lead is recovered in smelt\ning, why should not the producer be\npaid for it? When recovery was only\n90 per cent the smelter only paid for\nthat much. If the recovery is now 100\nper cent, why should the producer\nmake a present of that 10 per cent to\nthe smelter? In a fifty-ton carload of\nore carrying 50 per cent lead there art\'\n50,000 pounds of the black metal. Un\nder the present method of settling, 5000\npounds is cut out. That is a clean loss\nof two and one-half tous of lead to the\ncarload. Allowing that the smelter\ncharges only lj^ cents per pound for\nfreight on the bullion to the East, from\nthe 4-cent settling basis, it means that\nthe pritdncer has to stand for a loss of\njnst $087.50 on the carload. If he\nshipped a carload a week for a year it\nwould mean a loss ot $34,750.\nThis ought to be a pretty good prepo\nsition to have referred to Daniel Gug\ngenheim’s arbitrator for reasonable ad\njnstmeut.\nI\nDUCKWATER\nSTORE\nCarries a full line of\nMerchandise, Clothing,\nBoots, Shoes, Ammunition,\nLiquors, Cigars and To\nbacco.

Smelter to Operate\nFederal Court Suspends Injunction to Enable Company to Dem\nonstrate Claims—Reopening of Utab Smelting Plant\nExpected to Bring About Early Resumption\nof Work on Ruby Hill\nJudge John A. Marshall of the Federal Court suspended the\ninjunction against the United States Smelting A Refining Company\nat Salt Lake City on Saturday, April 4.\nThe news of Judge Marshall’s decision was received with great\njoy by the people of Eureka an,i Ruby Hill, who have patie it\'y\nbeen awaiting the outcome of the case. It is thought this means\nthe resumption of operations in a short time in the mines of the\nRichmond-Eureka Company on Ruby Hill and increased business\nactivity in Eureka. But at this writing—Saturday—Supt. A. P.\nMayberry states that he has received no instructions regarding the\nresumption of work at the company’s mines on Ruby Hill.\nThe following article from the Salt Lake Herald of April 5\ngives a brief history of the question at issue between the farmers\nand smelting company and also a summary of the points decided by\nJudge Marshall in dissovling the injunction:\nThe United States Smelting, Refin\ning & Mining Compauy is to he allowed\nto reopen and operate its big lead smelt\ning works at lhngham Junction, and\nsixty days hence the company expects\nto have the first furnace in commission,\nand as soon thereafter as possible to\nhave ne works going at capacity. The\nmatter was settled by Judge Marshall\nin the Federal Court yesterday morning\nwhen he decided to grant tbe com\npany’s petition for a modification of the\nfamous smelter smoke injuuotiou that\nwas secured by the farmers of the val\nley. Tbe decision caused all kinds of\nrejoicing in miuing and business circles\nof this city and, while possibly not all\nof the farmers will view the matter in\nthe samd light, it is believed that most\nof them will be glad that the matter\nhas been settled as it has.\nThe decision means the rehabilitation\nof the town of Bingham Junction; it\nmeans the employment of not less than\n750 men abont tbe works and the dis\ntribution of $75,000 a month for pay\nroll accouut. It means, also, that the\nsmelting company will spend from\n$160,000 to $200,000 for repairs and the\nbetterment of its plant during the next\nsixty to uiuety days, aud it means that\nthe miners of this region are not going\nto be it the complete mercy of the\nsmelting trust, or the American Smelt\ning & Refining Company. It means\nthat, within a few weeks, the United\nSlates Company will be ready to open\nthe gates to its works for the producers\nwho have contracts with it, and it\nmeaus that, as soon as the company can\nget squared away again, producers of\nall classes of ore other than ultra cop\nper products, will have the same oppor\ntunity to market their products that\nthey did before tbe injunction against\nall tbe valley smelters was issned.\nEverything Ashed for la Granted\nThe decision of Judge Marshall was\ndelivered orally, and it granted all that\nthe United States Company had asked\nfor. It gavj the company the right to\noperate nnder the restrictions it was\nwilling to have imposed in its applica\ntion, and granted the privilege of con\ntinuing the experiments it has been\nmaking for a long time and those iu\ncontemplation, providing only that, in\ncase damage was done to the farms,\nranches, etc., the United States Com\npany would be called upon to satisfy\nthem. This, Judge Marshall intimated,\nwould not be such a hard matter to\ndetermine, as there was the stipulation\nbetween the farmers and the American\nSmelting A Refining Company by\nwhich the latter was allowed to con\ntinue its lead smeltiug works in oper\nation, as a basis to figure from.\nUnder the terms by which the court\npermits the United States Company to\nresume, all solid particles, dust and\nfumes created in smeliiug ores must be\nprevented from being discharged into\nthe outer air, and the vapor that escapes\nthrough the stacks must not contain\nmore thau three-fourths of oue per cent\nof sulphur dioxide gas.\nThe managemeutof the United States\nCompauy was naturally elated at the\nfavorable ending of the case, and Presi\ndent W. G. Sharp and Managing Direc\ntor A. F. Holden, who have been pres\nent since the ma\'ter was taken up for\nconsideration by the court, pulled out\non the evening train for California,\nwhere they will make an inspection of\nthe company\'s Mammoth iniues and\nsmelting works and return a few days\nlater.\nManager He inti ’» Statement\n“We are not going to give the farm\ners any gronud for further complaint,”\nsaid George W. Heintz, geueral man\nager of the local plants and mines of\nthe United States Company, after the\ndecision had been rendered. “We don’t\npropose to allow anything to escape\nfrom the stajjts that will do a penny’s\nworth of iujury to anyone. Plans have\nall been prepared aud we shall begin\nthe construction at once of a new con\nverter roaster plaut. Like our patented\nprocess of neutralizing the gases and\nfumes that enter the bag house to pre\nvent the destruction of the cloth of\nwhich they are constructed, our ‘con\nverter toaster\' plant is a scheme of our\nown that will permit the roasting of\nores at a much lower temperature than\nwas possible by the old baud roaster\nmethod, while it will permit of the di\nversion of all fumes into the bag house\nat a temperature that will not en\ndauger the destruction of the bags by\nfire. Many other improvements are to\nbe introduced, aud when all is done we\nare certain there will be nothing about\nthe conduct of our smelting operations\nthat cau bring forth an honest protest\nfrom auybody."\nIt is understood that the United\ni States Company will now begin the ex\ntraction of lead ores from its Bingham\nmines, and that the concentrating plant\nnear thesmeltiug works will also go in\nto early commission to treat this ore.\nFarmer* Are Safeguarded\nBy the terms of the decision the\nfarmers are safeguarded against any\npossible barm resulting from the re\nopening of the plant, as the suspension\nof the injunction covers only the pe\nriod that the smelter may operate with\nout damage resulting.\nImprovement* Planned\nThe famous smelter smoke cases of\nwhich the present decision is a result\nhave been in the\' courts for over a year,\nand up nntil the present time the farm\ners have always been successful in their\ncase against the Bmelters. By a de\ncision of Judge Marshall an injunction\nwas grauted whereby all the smelters in\nthe valley were ordered to close down\nor comply with the terms of the iujuuo\ntion, which the smelter people said were\nso drastic ns to prohibit their operating.\nJmlge Marshall ordered that all of the\nsmelters must cease to emit from their\nsmokestacks all lead, arsenic, antimony\nor other deleterious solids, aud to cease\nto treat ores containing more than ten\nper cent sulphur.\nFollowing the issuance of this injunc\ntion the smelters filed an appeal to the\nCircuit Conrt of Appeals. Fending the\nappeal the American Smelting & Refin\ning Company made a settlement with\nthe farmers, paying the latter an indem\nnity for permission to continue to oper\nate. The other smelters filed superse\ndeas bonds and were allowed to continue\noperations until the case was finally\npassed upon. The Appellate Court sub\ntained the injunction, and a petition for\na writ of certiorari presented by the\nUnited States Compauy to the Supreme\nCourt of the United States was denied.\nDestructive Poisons Eliminated\nThe next move made by the smelters\nwas a petition presented to Jadge Mar\nshall fora modification of the injunc\ntion. The petition stated that the com\npany would install uew processes where\nby the solids would be eliminated from\nthe fumes and that no damage would\nresult from the operation of the smelter.\nThe attorneys for the smelter declared\nthat the smelter to continue operations\nmust treat some ores having a sulphur\ncontent of more than teu per cent.\nThey said that if the company were al\nlowed to treat a limited quantity of this\nore, approximately 200 tons a day, it\nwould also treat enough ore containing\na less percentage of sulphur so that in\nthe aggregate the amount of sulphur\ntreated with the ores would be less than\nten per cent.\nInjunction la Suapendad\nId granting the smelter permission to\nreopeD, Judge Marshall did not modify\nthe original injunction in the strict\nsense of the word, but granted a suspen\nsory order permitting the company to\noperate its plant until the farmers could\nshow that the fames were damaging\nvegetation. He permits the smelter to\ntreat ores containing more than ten per\ncent sulphur, providing that the aggre\ngate amonnt shall not average more\nthau ten per cent sulphur, and provid\ning that the total amount of sulphur\ncontained in the Bmoke shall not exceed\nseventy-five one-hnndredths of one per\nceut sulphnr dioxide.\nThe decision of the court was verbal,\naud was given with the understanding\nthat the attorneys for the smelter,\nDickson, Ellis & Ellis aud Uowatt &\nMcMillan, should prepare a form con\ntaining the conditions imposed, which\nshall be submitted to Judge W. H. King\naud Senator Hawlius, attorneys for the\nfarmers, aud that both parties shall\nagree to these terms, after which the\norder will be signed by the court.\nThe smeltiug compauy will at once\nstart making the improvements on the\nplant to comply with the terms of the\nsuspension of the injunction, and in\ntwo mouths will begin once more the\ntreating of ores, though the improve\nments will not be completed and the\nplant will not be operating to the limit\nof its capacity before six months.\nJudge King said that if the smelting\ncompauy lived up to its promise and\ndid not injure the crops, there would\nbe no complaint on the part of the\nfarmers. George W. Heintx, general\nmanager of the smelter, regards the\noutcome as a substantial victory for his\ncompany, aud believes that as a result\nthe other smelters will aoou reopen un\nder similar terms.\nFlower Seeds for Sale\nMis.

So much depends upon the girl,\nyou know. If 1 could see her aud have\nu ten mlnntes\' chat with her, I could\ntell whether yon have drawn a prize\nor a blank.

Beauty, iny boy. Is a mighty\ngood thing. Your mother was the pret\ntiest girl I ever saw or ever hope to\nsee—begging your pardon—and she Is\nstill the most beautiful woman this\nside the pearly gates. In my estima\ntion, but you can\'t reasonably expect\nto be as fortunate as your father In\nthat particular. Beauty is a very de\nsirable, but not a necessary attribute\nof a wife, and a man stands a mighty\npoor chance of permanent happiness\nwho banks on it alone. It Isn’t always\ndesirable even. It Is likely to produce\nvanity, and vanity, besides several\nother disagreeable features, leads to\nextravagance. I won\'t stop to tell you\nwhat extravagance leads to. It would\nfill a book, and there would be nothing\ncomfortable In the whole volume.\nReminds me of an old friend, one of\nthese art enthusiasts, who fell in love\nwith a flat because of its impressive\n“facade.” He didn’t stop to Investi\ngate what was back of the “facade,”\nbut took a lease at a pretty stiff figure.\nHe wanted a “facade,” and he got It\ngood and plenty, as I’ve heard you re\nmark. Within a month he found thnt\neverything behind that artistic front\nwas a heartbreaking sham. The plas\nter cracked and dropped on his head\nIn painful chunks; the doors sagged\nand refused to shut without a lavish\nexpenditure of power and profanity;\nthe furnace could be Induced to supply\nnothing but refrigerated air—and he\nhad a lease. It’s probably too late, but,\nmy dear boy, before you close the deal\nget back of the “facade” if you can.\nNot Always a Lottary.\nYou have been always a pretty level\nheaded youngster, and I have great\nhopes that you have chosen wisely. In\ndeed, I get considerable encouragement\nfrom the way she spells her names as\nthey were given to her when she was\nchristened. It Indicates that if she\never had any silly stage she has passed\nthrough It safely. Our Annyes and\nMayes and Ellyns are all afflicted with\na mental weakness that doesn’t do any\nparticular harm If they get over It. As\na rule they do. but If they don’t Lord\nhelp their husbands! After all, though,\nthe average American girl has a mighty\ngood substratum of common sense, and\nIf a man goes Into It with his eyes\nwide open mar\nriage isn’t such\na lottery as it\'s\ncracked up to\nbe. That lottery\ntheory Is based\non the Idea—an\nIdea that all\nwho wear trou\nsers are apt to\naccept without\nquestion — that\nman, myself In\nparticular, 1 s\nall right. “The The door$ tagged.\nrisk Is all on my side,” says he to him\nself. “The woman that gets me ought\nto consider herself In luck." As a mat\nter of fact, there are more masculine\nthan feminine blanks In this world,\nand when a man contemplates mar\nriage he ought first to consider his own\nqualifications—get \'em out and look at\n’em through a microscope and don’t\nlet any personal bias Interfere with a\nproper focus.\nIn the first place, am I able to sup\nport a wife—the wife I have In mind!\nGiven the proper financial backing,\nare my habits and disposition such\nthat a sensitive and sensible woman\ncan live with me for a lifetime with\nout an occasional desire to jump into\nthe river? Few men stop to consider\nthat side of the proposition, and when\nthe wheels of the matrimonial wagon\nbegin to creak they wonder what’s the\nmatter. Talk about the divorce evil!\nIf woman wasn’t the most long suffer\ning creature on the face of the earth,\nall the courts of Christendom would be\nfilled with divorce cases. But that’s a\ndigression. As I was saying, lake\nstock of voorscff and then consider the\ngirt.\nSents Better Than Learning.\nThe main thing to be desired In a\nwoman Is sense. And by that I don\'t\nmean education. It’s a mighty fine\nthins to he on\nspeaking terms\nwith the class\nics, and a knowl\nedceof the blsh\ner mathematics\nand Browning\'s\npoems does no\nparticular barm\nIf It Isn\'t allow\ned to stick out.\nhut education\nbeyond the\ngrammar school\ncourse Is not an\nessential. I»ou\'t\nChuck full of ipiota- deceive your\ntlone. self Into think\ning learning an Indication of brains\nor occasional silliness a lack of them.\nSome of the biggest fools I ever\nknew, male and female. wi»» chock\nfull of facts and figures ind quota\ntions and other mental Ininber that\ndidn’t do them or anybody else any\ngood. I don\'t mean to belittle the\nvnlne of learning. Xo one appreci\nates It more than I do. But It doesn\'t\nspell sense. On the other hand, all\nnormal boys and girls pass through\na silly period, and most nil grown\npeople have occasional lapses In that\ndirection, a sort of cerebral vaca\ntion, which Is sometimes t>eneficlal to\nthe Individual If not always edifying\nto others. But the possession of a\npractical workaday Intelligence will\nstick out iu spite of all that nature or\nteachers may do to cover it up. and if\nyou can come down from the clouds\nlong enough to take stock you should\nbe able to satisfy yourself on that point\nIf you haven\'t already done so.\nYou notice I don\'t ask you about\nMiss Jackson\'s fortune. I don\'t care\nwhether she has a red cent or not. In\nfact, I hope she hasn\'t, for the poor\nman who marries a fortune is up\nagainst one of the hardest propositions\nour sex can have to contend with. Un\nless be has character and strength of\npurpose far l>eyond the ordinary he Is\nalmost sure to degenerate, to become a\nmere appendage, of less vnlue to him\nself and the world than one of his\nwife’s servants. If the girl you ex\npect to marry has money, see to It\nthat she keeps it. and keeps It where\nyou can\'t get at It. Hoe your own\nrow.\nThere’s only one way to make a\nman, and digging for a home Is the\nprocess If she has nothing, you can\nstart even and pull together, and I tell\nyou, my boy, there\'s nothing In this\nworld so heartens u man as a willing\nwoman hitched to the same load. If\nshe have sense and love she will pull,\ntoo, harder perhaps than you can, but\nIf she be a fool, no matter how she\nmar be veneered with the graces of\nsociety, no matter how erudite she\nmay be, she will balk or kick over the\ntraces, and If she doesn\'t spill the load\nshe\'ll make it all the harder for you tc\ndraw. So I say that a few grains of\nNothing so heartens a man as a willing\nwoman hitched to the mime load.\nplain common sense are of more Im\nportance in a wife than beauty, money\nor culture. If Miss Jackson has it,\nthen I say go ahead, and your mother\nand I will give you our blessing and\nj something else.\nDon\'t fool around about it either. I\ndon’t lielieve in long engagements.\nThere is nothing so wearing on a wo\nman as a protracted wedding. If you\nhave no debts and enough money in\nyour pocket or the bank to pay the\npreacher and furnish up a little flat,\ndon’t put off the day any longer than\nis necessary for her to get ready. As\na rule, a girl wants a few months, per\nhaps n year, for preparation; a man\nIn the first enthusiasm of acceptance\nwants to be married tomorrow, today,\nright now. The girl Is right. The al\ntar should not be boarded like a delay\ned trolley car. Take your time, but\nnot too much time. The engagement\nperiod has Its psychical as well as Its\nmaterial purpose. It Is a period of\npreparation of mind and heart as well\naa of raiment.\nIt Is an Important factor In the mak\ning of future happiness, and it should\nnever be skipped unless circumstances\nare exceptional. But It should not be\nallowed to linger beyond the reason\nable time necessary for preparation. It\nIs the man who wants to marry on the\nspot, and It Is usually the man who\ncauses the repeated postponement of\nthe wedding. Either he grows Indif\nferent or thinks It necessary to In\ncrease his financial resources, and the\nlonger he delays the harder It Is to fix\nthe date, while the girl can do nothing\nbut wait and wonder and doubt. Then\nIs the time when "hope deferred mak\neth the heart sick” sure enough. Don’t\nlet your engagement continue more\nman a year. Three or six mouths\nshould be long enough.\nDecently and In Order.\nWheu you get married, have it dona\nright. Don\'t go frisking out to a sub\nurban Justice of the peace to have the\nknot tied without trouble and without\nceremony. Next to your birth and your\ndeath it\'s the most important event of\nyour life. Your funeral may be an im\nposing one, but you will uot be in a po\nsition to appreciate it. Y\'ou will play\nsecond fiddle at your wedding, but it’s\nyour show nevertheless, and you should\nmake It as impressive as you can. I\ndon’t mean by that to encourage lavish\nexpenditure. Gorgeous decorations and\nall that sort of thing detract from the\ntrue feature of the occasion. That,\nhowever. Is none of your affair. The\nbride’s parents attend to that. The\npoint I am trying to make is that the\nwedding should take place In the pres\nence of a number of invited guests, as\nmany as practicable. Whether at home\nor at church doesn’t particularly mat\nter, although I prefer a church wed\nding because it can be made more im\npressive and because of the deej>er re\nligious significance. When I use the\nword impressive, I don’t want it ap\nplied to the witnesses, hut to you and\nto the girl, you stand so with. It is\nupon yon. both of yon, that the Impres\nsion should be made, and It outfit to |\nhe strong enontfi and deep enough to\nkeep you trottine alone together for j\nthe remainder of your life. I hare no- ,\ntired that these fly by night, ‘let\'s go j\nout and get married" weddines are\nresponsible for a large proportion of\nthe divorce cases In onr courts.

You ought to get the idea\nof the solemnity and responsibility of\nmarriage pufnped into yourself and\nyour sweetheart until you nre both\nsaturated with it. Then walk up to the\nili ir with Joy in your hearts, and If\nyou can\'t live h ippy ever after it won’t\nbe the fault of the preacher.\nNow. my dear Iniy. I neither suppose\nnor expect you will pay the slightest\nattention to anything I have said. As\nI heard an alleged comedian remark\nthe other night, "I Just had It on my\nchest, and it had to come off." Yours\ntruly.

Is represented\nin tbe recent altercation by Senator\nOwen, who stands for putting the In\ndlaus on a complete equality with the\nwhites before tbe law. while Senator\nCurtis, like Red Jacket of old, Is sus\npicious of tbe white man, at least of\nthe type represented In many living\nnear the reservations, who scheme to\nget control of Indian lands. Old Sa\nOo-Ye-Wat-IIa’was keen and unrelent\nIng in his efforts to match the cunning\nof tbe white men who sought to take\nfrom his people their lands and their\nbirthright. That is the role Charles\nCurtis, the first Indian senator, would\nplay at Washington. He says it Is best\nto go slow about placing tbe red man\non an exact equality with the pale face,\nbecause experience has shown that he\ngets worsted In a contest requiring\nknowledge of civilization, so called.\nHe opposes removal of all restrictions\nupon tbe Indian regarding the way be\nmay dispose of his rights in land.\nSenator Owen, on tbe other band,\nwent to congress as an avowed advo- i\ncate of removal of such restrictions, j\nIn the clash between the two men of!\n■KNaTOR CTRTI3.
