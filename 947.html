The wooden cottage\nof an artisan was the only building\nwholly destroyed. It was pierced by a\nshell from a 12-inch gun, which, after\ntraversing the roof and wall, fell in\nthe yard, killing the woman, previously\nreferred to.\nIn the quarter of the city called the\n"Dirty: Corner" a shell fell on the\nhouse of Colonel Shukoff without ex\xad\nploding. It traversed a bedroom, de\xad\nstroying a stove and penetrated the\nwall. It finally burst\' near the\' regi\xad\nmental saie, which was standing in\nthe courtyard. A sentry guaruing the\nsate was covered with mud, but was\nnot injured.\nFive saiiors were slightly wounded\nby the explosion of a shell in the court\xad\nyard of the Siberian naval barracks.\nOutside ot these casualties no one\nwas killed or injured and there was\nno outbreak pf fire in the City. The\nfact that the Russian batteries did not\nreply to the Japanese bombardment\nwas due partially to the slight chance\not hitting the enemy\'s warships at\nsuch a Jong range and partially to a\ndesire not to betray the position of the\nbatteries.\nIt is now thought that the attacking\nsquadron consisted of a battleship,\nfour armored cruisers and two unpro\xad\ntected cruisers.\nMAY COVER LAND MOVE.\nAlleged Reason for Bombardment of\nVladivostok.\nSt Petersburg, March 8.—Although\nthe prevailing opinion in military cir\xad\ncles continues to be that the bombard\xad\nment of Vladivostok Sunday was for\nthe purpose of locating the guns of the\nRussian batteries and to ascertain\nwhether the Russian squadron was in\nport some shrewd observers believe it\nindicates a move by land and sea\nagainst the city.\nThe Novoe Vremya advances the\ntheory that the bombardment was or\xad\ndered for oolitical effect on the Jap\xad\nanese diet.\nIt is considered here especially un\xad\nfortunate that the Japanese did not\ngo close enough to Vladivostok to es\xad\ntablish the identity of their ships,\nleaving the question whether they\nvrere a division of the PoH Arthur\nfleet In doubt It is not believed, how\xad\never, the Japanese would dare to di\xad\nvide the latter, which would involve\nthe risk of a sortie by the Russians\nand their playing havoc with the Jap»\nanese transport flotilla.

The\nresolutions express "hearty sympathy\nand admiration for the great and\nknightly, Japanese nation" and con\xad\ntinue:\n"We hereby express our sincere and\nhearty wishes and prayers that the\nbrave efforts of the Japanese nation\nmay at the earliest possible time be\ncrowned with success."\nThe resolutions are signed by the\nnational officers of the following or\xad\nganizations: The Polish Roman Cath\xad\nolic Federation of America, the Polish\nNational alliance, the Polifih Roman\nCattfolic union.\nTO COVER MOVEMENT OF TROOPS\nRussian Vladivostok Squadron Near\nMouth of Tumen River.\nTokio, March 8.—It is believed that\nthe Russian Vladivostok squadron is\nnow in the vicinity of the mouth of the\nTumen river engaged in covering the\nmovement of troops from Possiet bay\nto the valley of Tumen.\nRussian scouts are reliably reported\nto have penetrated south as. far as\nKieungsung. The earlier Russian\nmovement into Northeastern Korea\nwas regarded as a diversion, but it\nnow appears that a considerable force\nparticipated. It is thought that the\nRussians may occupy and\'fortify some\nstrong position on the Tumen river.\nReports regarding Russian movements\nin Northwestern Korea are meager\nand unreliable.

The telegram continues:\n"Statements to the contrary are\nfalse. Ask, Smith to show any chil\xad\ndren from any of the alleged plural\nwives of the first Joseph Smith.

Senator Dubois\nput into the record the census figures\nfor Utah, taken in 1890, to show that\ninstead of only 3 or 4 per cent in\npolygamy as Mr. Smith had said In\nreality there were, about 23% per cent\nof the Mormon population of an age\nenabling them to be polygamists who\nwere in that state in 1890. Mr. Dubois\ngave it as his opinion that there has\nbeen no material reduction in the num\xad\nber of polygamists since 1890.\nIn answer to Questions by Mr.\nWorthington and Senator Burrows Mr.\nSmith said Senator Smoot had never\nadvised for or against continuance off^iHj\npolygamous cohabitation.\nIn relation to ^onvictkms Mr.\nsaid there have been none .since the^jn\nmanifesto of 1890 that\nall\nvictions under the Edmonds\nwhile Utah waa atwcrttorx,\n\'•i!\n*1\nof the con-^\nlaw ware-', 'tk\nt\'.\nw\\.\n$•*,\ni%\n7~A.\nfe-i\ni?-?\nfer\nl%v\nl"%\njvr .* iffc\n\'V *&:\nJv\nTHE DAILY TRIBUNE.\nPublished every afternoon, except SutJ\niar, at Bismarck, North Dakota, is deliv\xad\nered by carrier to all parts of the city at\nfO cents per months, or 96 per yean The\ndally sent to any address In the United\nStates and Canada, postage prepaid, (8 per\nyear $3 for six months: $1-50 for three\nmonths.\nTHE WEEKLY TRIBUNE.\nPublished every Friday eight (ages,\ncontaining a summary of the news (f the\nweek—local and foreign—particular atten\xad\ntion being paid to state news.

It has a wide circulation and Is\na desirable advertising medium. Being\npublished at the capital of the state It\nmakes a feature of state news, of a semi\xad\nofficial character, and is therefore particu\xad\nlarly interesting to all who desire to keep\nthe run of state affairs—political, social\nand business.\nWithin a day or so the Tribune will\nbe able to present the complete re\xad\nport of the special committee appoint\xad\ned some time ago by Mayor Register\nto consider plans for a sewerage\nsystem for Bismarck and report upon\nthe. sanitary, legal and expense feat\xad\nures of the proposition. A sewerage\nsystem is an essential for growing\ncities. Bismarck, because of her pe\xad\nculiar drainage facilities, has been\n,and will be a healthy city, but a\nsewerage system would add to its\ndesirability as a place of residence\nand would insure permanent healthful\nconditions. With its invigorating\nclimate, pure water and system of\ndrainage, there would be no city in\nthe northwest so favorably situated.\nThe report of the special committee\nlias been nearly completed. Alder\xad\nman Smyth, a member of the commit\xad\ntee reports upon the sanitary features\nof the matter and includes a report\nfrom Health Officer Ramstad as to\nthe desirablility of the system. Mr.\n"Newton reports on the legal phases\n•of the system, the method of proced\xad\nure and the general legal process and\nMr. Hoskins reports on the probable\ncost. This latter is estimated at\n*$10,000 for the construction of a trunk\nsewer from Ninth street to the river,\n"with a probable cost of $1 a foot for\n•city lot property, which payments,\nTvith interest, might be extended over\nit period of twenty years.
