This oil painting, by\nthe late Thomas Nast, entitled "Tbw\nImmortal Light of Oenius," Is a replica\nof a picture painted by the celebrated\nAmerican cartoonist for Sir Henry\nIrving, who presented It to the Insti\ntute founded by William Winter on\nStaten Island. The artist, feeling that\nIn this picture he had put his best\nwork, made a replica for himself.\nAfter Thomas Nast\'s death, his\nwidow, In pursuunce of her husband\'s\nwishes, gave the replica to the gov\nernors of the Shakespeare memorial,\nStratford-on-Avon. and it now adorns\nthe entrance to the theater there. The\nscene represents the room In which\nShakespeare was born. The "Iramor\ntal Llpht of Genius" emanates like a\nnimbus from the head of a bust of\nShakespeare to which the shades of\nComedy and Tragedy offer wreaths of\nlaurel.\nThe conception is In Nast\'s best\nmanner, the rich somber color tones\nheighten the effect of the supernatural\nlight surrounding the poet\'s Image,\nnnd the marvelous treatment of the\nghost-like figures Is Inimitable. The\npicture Is a finely executed work of art\nworthy of the high reputation of the\nartist. Through the generosity of Mrs.\nNast, It Is now most appropriately\nplaced In the actual shrine of Shakes\npearean drama, in the poet\'s natal\ntown, where It will be seen by thou\nsands of Shakespearean students, both\nEnglish and American.\nFALL OF FAMOUS "SHIP."\nDrsrsrrstloo of British Inn Which\nfor Many Years lias Keen Mecca\nof Celebrated People.\nEvil times have befallen the famous\nold "Ship" inn at Greenwich, Eng\nland, which for generations had been\nthe Mecca of all bons vlveurs who\nloved whitebait, which was a specialty\nof th\' bouse.\nIt t sed to be a recognized form of\nouting to take the penny steamer to\nGreenwich and dine at the "Ship\nwhitebait always figuring largely in\nthe menu. For many years It was a\ncustom for cabinet ministers to hold\nwhitebait dinner at the old Greenwich\nhoetelry at the close of every session\nThis was continued down to 1894\nwhen Lord Roeebery\'s administration\nwas in power, but since the conserva\ntives have been "in" the custom has\nlapsed. The once thriving business\ncarried on at the "Ship" is now In the\nhands of a receiver in bankruptcy, and\nit ha the prospect before it of de\ngenerating Into a common local "pub.\nThe cause of its downfall Is directly\ndue to Ihe unfortunate muddling which\nhas deprived the Thames of its fleet\nof passenger steamers.\nReaders of "Pendennis" may remem\nber how Mr. Harry Foker delighted\nin driving his fair friend In a "bang\nnp gig" to the "Ship" for a quiet tete-\na-tete dinner\nARGUE VALUE OF OLD WINE.\nSevf siaper Inquiry Khons T hat Con.\nnolascura Differ as to Merit\nnf Aaed Fort.\nA Ixindon newspaper Inquiry as to\nwho has the oldest port wine has led\nto a discussion of the value from S\nfinancial and dietetic standpoint of\ncentenarian port. The oldest wine re\nported Is that of the vintage of 1773.\nThere are others of lSnS. 1811, 1820\nand 1S40, which are reported as per\nfectly sound.\nConnoisseurs and dietlsis dispute\nthe value of this very old wine. One\nfamous judi;e declares that he would\nnot give 18 pence a bottle for a 1775\nport, as the spirit added to forMy it\nmust have ealen up all the "flesh "\nMr. Yorke Davies, a famous dietist\nand connoisseur, declares that a good\nvintage of port, when properly bottled\nand prepared, will continue to Improve\nafter a century. He recently tasted\nsamples of the vintages of 17S7 and\n1S15. Both were In splendid condition.\nthe older being if anything better\nwine.\nSpeaking as a dietist of exceptional\nexperience, he asserted that port of\ngood vintage, in cask or bottle, might\nbe drunk with impunity by gouty per\nsons, to whom any other bottled wine\nof the same age would be prohibited.\nNEW CRAZE IN ENGLAND.\nLatest British Fad Is la Cross Hassla\nby Way of Trsns-Slberlan\nRailway.\nThe latest fashionable craze amor.;\nthe English Is to erots Russia to Asia by\nthe Trans-Siberian railway. Ij,d\nLyster Kaye, formerly Miss Yznaga.and\nher husband have left with a retinue of\nservants and stacks of luggage and furs\nto make the trip. They have planned a\nsix months\' excursion, doing Japan and\nreturning by way of San Francisco.\nIf one wants to be right up to date in\nBritish "smart society" one must do the\nSt. Petersburg season and the Trans-\nSiberian route if one can afford its ex\ntravagant cost. The train is said to be\nthe most luxurious thing ever designed\nIn Europe and the comforts of traveling\non it are reported to be reduced to fairy\ntale realization.\nMost Americans here want to make ths\nip. but they live at such a rate that\nthey object to the time it consumes.\nOne Effect of Marriage.\nAn Indiana man went rraw nn Ms\nwedding day.

Conn., the\n\'other morning a spectral-looking flg\n\' ure was clinging to the pilot of the\nI locomotive. When the police removed\n! him he was too numb with cold to\nstand, and was raving in delirium.\nIt was Joseph Collins, of Ansonla,\nwho, Intoxicated, had crawled on the\nlocomotive at New Haven to steal a\nride home. The distance to Naugat\'ick\nis 25 miles. The train bad made seven\nstops, but Collins was too stiff from\ncold to get oft. His hat was missing\nhis coat blown into shreds and his\nbody plastered with mud and gravel\nfrom head to foot. In the Naugatuck\npolice court he was given 30 days in\njail for Intoxication.\nSpeaking of the ride, Collins said\n"My bead was hot from drink, and\nfor about a mile the ride was delight\nful. Then it became bitter cold. As\nthe engine rocked and careened around\ncurves J thought I was doomed, but,\nwinding my arms around an iron bar,\nI clung with desperation. A deafening\nroar filled my ears. The hard Iron\nbruised me terribly. Flying particles\nof dirt hit me stinging blows, and the\nair felt like shafts of ice. After twice\nlosing consciousness, I awoke to find\nthe train standing in Ansonia.\n"When I started to get off I was\npowerless to move. As the train\nmoved on, however, I became filled\nwith a wild exhilaration and seemed\nto be flying through space. I cried to\nthe engineer to crowd on steam. That\nIs all I remember till I awoke in the\nNaugatuck police station."\nEXCUSE FOR HIS FRIGHT.\nBaltimore Maa Goes Into Barber Shop\nfor a Shave and Awakes to Find\nCow I.lcklnir His Face.\nWhen a sober man falls asleep in. a\nbarber\'s chair and awakes to find a\ncow licking his face he will be ex\ncused if he shows fright\nThat happened to a customer of\nGeorge J. Gr.iiser, a barber, of Balti\nmore. The victim of the cow\'s ca\nresses may be running yet, for all\nGraiser knows.\nIt was seven o\'clock in the morning\nwhen the stranger entered, and. re\nmarking that he "guessed he would be\nshaved before going to bed," threw\nhimself into the chair and went fast\nasleep. Graiser had partly lathered\nhim when Mrs. Graiser told the barber\nthat breakfast was ready.\nAs Graiser wag hungry and as his\ncustomer was snorlnjr contentedly, the\nbarber went after a cup of coffee. His\nbark was hardly turned when a cow\nwandered In. It strolled up to the\nchair where the s\'eepliis customer lay\nand began to stroke the man\'s face\nw:ith Its rough tongue.\nThe sleeper awakened, gave one\nscream and darted for the door.\nThe commotion brought the Grais\ners. As they rushed in the cow, whose\nnerves had been somev. hat upset, made\na rush to get out. and in doing so\nknocked down a tove, overturned two\nbarber chairs and demolished a mir\nror that cost Graiser $42.\nGraiser later found the owner of the\ncow, and has presented a bill for the\ndamage, which he estimates at $125.\nTHE SLEEPING SICKNESS.\nThree fasts Xntlves A re Rein Treat\ned la Parla for Mranae Disease\nf anaed by a Parasite.\nThree Congo negroes who were\nbrought to Paris are undergoing treat\nment for the mysterious sleeping sick\nness.

He does nothing but eat\nand sleep.\nThe third, a boy of 13 or 14. of a can\nnibal tribe, has shown the peculiar re\nsult that the disease neutralizes the\neffects of cocaine.\nDr. Wurtz does not think that the\nsleeping sickness is caused by a mi\ncrobe, but by a trypanosoma belonging\nto the same group of parrtsltes which\nattacks caule.\nQUEEN HELENA WRITES VERSE\nItaly- Prom! ftt Literary AcooniplUh-\nnitftit of the Sovrre Uii-Othr r\nKojal I.tttera tfnra.\nItaly delights in the accomplish\nments of her beautiful Queen Helena\nand is proud that she is included\namong the royal litterateurs of Europe.\nAs a young girl she published in a\njournal at her home at Cel!i;;ne,\nMontenegro, verses that were greaMy\nadmired.\nDowager Qneen Margaret is the\nauthor of religious verve3 included in\nall the Italian anthologies.

Her laundry\ncomprised a room possibly six yards\nsquare, with appurtenances pitiably m\nadequate.\nThe countess, a refined and dignified\nlittle woman, was recently interviewed\nby a correspondent. She wore a dark\napron and black lace cap. She also\nwore glasses. Suffering was written\nupon without obliterating the nobility\nof her features. When the corre\nspondent offered the noble washer\nwoman his card, simultaneously ex\nplaining his mission, she said:\n\'No, no. I can\'t be interviewed.\nIt\'s impossible. My two assistants\nhave already left me on learning my\nidentity. They are of the people and\nsaid, mockingly: \'We cannot think of\nworking Desiue sum a grunue uumc.\nThen the landlord came and I was\nforced to borrow two dollars to pay the\nrent."\nShe was assured that her story was\nwanted lor ttie umtea states viuy. nuu\nthereupon told her story:\n"I am Countess de Francqueville,\ndaughter of a general of brigade in the\nFrench army in Africa." she said.\n"Father was promoted from colonel by\nNapoleon HI., nnd on several occasions\nsaved the life of Due d\'Aumale. From\ngratitude the due became my godfa\nther. I was born at sea off Algiers, my\nmother dying at my birth. My hus\nband, Count de Francqueville, was my\nrousln-german, and our names were\nthe same before our marriage. My\nhusband committed suicide 20 years\nago, alter losing a large sum at bac\ncarat. \'Once I had $10,000 Income from\nproperty left by my father, but I lost\nmy fortune in a banking failure.\nWhile the duke lived he made liberal\nprovision for me personally, but in his\nwill, instead of leaving me a mod\nest pension, he left me a sura in\nvolving millions. His relatives refused\npayment, and I lack funds to fight\nin the courts.\n"I have tried many things in my\nstruggle for life, even sewing rabbit\nskins. Then I decided to try a laundry.\ngetting this little place on credit. But\nnow the story is out I am undone, de\nserted by my assistants, and my credit\npone. Before this I could make nearly\nfour dollars weekly after paying my\ntwo women; but, worst of all, the due\'s\nname is dragged into my miserable\nstory."\nThe countess explained that Due de\nCharles, brother of D\'Aumale.

BUGS CARRY PLAGUE GERMS.\nI n - l ife In llona-KonK lloaaea An\nFound to II Souree of Frequent\nOutbrenka.\nThe recurrence of the bubonic\nplague every spring at Hong-Kong and\nthe fact of its breaking out simultan\neously at two or three unconnected\nneighborhoods led Sir Henry Blake,\ngovernor of the colony, to make ex\nperiments, with the object of discov\nering the source of the disease. A\nMock of native houses, containing\nseveral thousand inhabitants, the\nbuildings being certified as free of\nplague, was selected for examination\nof vermin as the first step.\nThe result was startling. A consid\nerable proportion of bugs, f.i as. cock\nroaches and spiders was found to be\nunmistakably infected with the germs\nof the plague. The bi!e of these in\nsevts revealed a more distutbing\nsource of infection in samples of blood\ntaken from many supposed healthy\npersons. The samples were sent tc\nthe bacteriological department. Plague\ngerms were discovered in at leas; five\nper cent, of these samples. Thus In\nthe hot sea.-on each of these waj a\nprobable i enter of danger, although\nthere was no apparent contact with\nthe dise-ise. The only cure seems to\nbe the destruction of the native town\nand the ereciion of a new and clean\none which ran be kept undT sanitary\ncontrol.\nOther May Try It.\nA San Frar.i isco man has sued foi\ndivorce b au.e the spirits to\'i hira\nhis wife lad reasd to love him.\nPou\'tic-- there are many men who\nwill v r.nxiouslv to hear whether\ni \' ; - net.\ni .itton In Raodrila.\nIt ha- \'-ii found, tf-rouch exteci\ned rper - .-r.ts. that Rhodesia cao\nrres\'\'e fi-tx c!j4 co\'tcn. whVh will\ncrn -::.Lii ; :!.c ! ici-ct price in Liver-\nr\nMUCH PEAT NEAR CHICAGO.\nLaolurrr Smyt There Are Ilnndreda\nof Airn of (be "Coinlna Fnel"\nIn City Llmlla.\n"Peat la the coming fuel, and there\nis enough uf it within 60 miles of\nChicago to supply the city for a hun-\ndred years," declared J. Campbell Mor\nrison in a lecture before the Robert\nFulton Association of Stationary En\ngineers at Chicago recently.\n"Peat is coal in embryo," he added.\n"Under heat and great pressure it be\ncomes coal. Nature takes thousands\nof years to complete the transforma\ntion, and then the coal is burled deep\nunder ground, is mixed with foreign\nsubstances and has lost much of the\nheat-giving power which the original\npeat had.\n"There is no European process\nwhich will produce a briquette im\npervious to moisture without driving\noff part of the volatile substances con\ntained in the peat and lessening the\nfuel value. But an American inven\ntlon has made this possible at small\nexpense.\n"In the new process the peat is dug\nby machinery and delivered to a shred\nder, which pulls the fibers apart. It\nIs then dried In a long inclined rotat\ning cylinder, through which hot gases\nare passing. The dried peat is pulver\nized and molded into briquettes under\nheavy pressure, and the briquettes are\nforced through heated . molds, which\nbrings the oils in the peat to the stir\nface and gives it a smooth finish that\nwater will not penetrate." .\n"These briquettes make the best fuel\non earth. They burn with a clear\nbright flame- and no smoke and give\nmore heat than an equal weight of\ncoal. They retain their shape until\nconsumed and leave a small amount\nof ash as fine as flour. Peat a foot\nthick over one acre will make 300\ntons of briquettes. There are hundreds\nof acres of it within the city limits of\nChicago."\nCRIMINALS FOR DISEASE TEST.\nI\'hilailrlpliln Phjutolnn Advoratea\nInoculntlon of Felona with\nTnUerculoala Urrma.\nIn discussing the infection of human\nbeings with animal tuberculosis before\nthe American Public Health associa\ntion at Wash.ngton the other day Dr.\nMazyck P. Ravenel. of Philadelphia,\nurged that criminals condemned to\ndeath be inoculated with the tubercle\ngerm that physicians might be enabled\nto study the development of the dis\nease from the start. He regretted that\nthe federal and state governments\nwould not permit this, declaring that\nit would greatly advance the interests\nof science. He said he was sure that\na man condemned to death would most\nwillingly take his chances of contract\ning tuberculosis as against electrocu\ntion or hanging.\nHe emphatically controverted the\ncommon theory that dry sputum was\nthe underlying cause of tubetcular in\nfection and said that there was abso\nlutely not one whit of evidence that\nit ever caused a single case of tuber\nculosis in mankind. He produced nu\nmerous statistics showing bovine tu\nbercular infection of human beings,\nand said that the bovine tubercular\nbacillus was much more virulent than\nthat of the human being. He conclud\ned by strongly urging that every pre\ncaution should be taken by the asso\nciation as sanitarians for the protec\ntion of the food supply as derived from\ncattle.\nMU3T PAY FOR MASSES.\nSen- York Conrt Makra Sweeping Rat\nine Affertinc: the Roman\nCatholic Belief.\nThe most sweeping ruling by an\nAmerican court concerning a matter\nof Roman Catholic belief since it was\nheld in New York years ago that a\npriest cannot be compelled to testify\nto the secrets of the confessional has\nbeen made by Surrogate George A.\nBenton at Rochester, N. Y.\nThe case was that of John S. Keen\nan. as administrator of the estate of\nRev. James P. Kieruan. Keenan put\nin a claim for $5H) willed to Father\nKiernan for masses by Daniel Lane.\nMr. Lane died July 3. 1S97. and Father\nKiernan May 13. 1JW0. Judge Benton\nsaid:\n"It is not natural to suppose that\nthe testator making a bequest for such\na purpose would so distrust his lega\ntee as to insist that the service should\nbe performed before the money was\npaid."\nThe substance of the decision is that\nthe performance of the masses by the\npriest in such a case is a duty laid\nupon the conscience of the c!er?yinin\nalone and that the legacy vests in the\npriest and passes to his legal repre\nsentative, w ho Is in a position to claim\nits payment.\nThe case has no exact parallel in the\nhistory of I\'nited States courts.\nBattle of the berana.\nNow it develops that laines is a dis\nease produced by a germ whose full n&ff.e\nis "I\'ntinnaria.

The pastures afford\ngood grazing, the woodland is rich in\nmarketable timber, the soil is fertile,\nthe community is out of debt; and\nthough it is not getting wealthy, all\nhav plenty to eat and wear, and are\nliving in peace and contentment.\nThe colony is governed by a chair\nman and a committee of three men.\nwith a manager, who arranges all the j\nindustrial affairs in accordance with I\nthe general plan of the committee,\nwhich meets weekly.\nBy dint of brawn and perseverance\nth wen have cleared 360 acres of for\nest and are raising sugar cane, maize, \'\nmanioc, yams, oranacs. lmons. bana- I\nnas. sweet potatoes, peaches and vejre- \'\ntables.
