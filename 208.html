The\ntotal tlgurers of western mineral pro\nduction as compiled by tbe survey are\n$313,944,881. This Is about one-fourth\nthe total agricultural of tbe same area,\nthe proportion between mineral and\nagricultural production being about\ntbe same as for the entire United\nStates.

Pbalen and Junt pub-.\nHalted by the United States geological\nsurvey. This was an increase of 108,\n010 barrels ; over tbe production of\niuuu hut a decrease in value amount\ning to t443,487. The six leading pro\nducers of salt in 1910 were New York,\nMichigan, Ohio, Kansas, Louisiana\nand California, Nearly 90 per cent of\nthe salt consumed in the country was\nobtained from\' domestic source, the\nUnited States having long been inde\npendent of forelKn production. ,\nSalt Is thought of mostly In connec\ntion with cooking and seasoning, but,\nit has a great many other important\napplications. It. is used largely lo the\npreservation of dsti and meat, In the\ndairying industry,, and in chemical\nmetallurgical processes. It Is ulsn\nused as a source of chlorine employed\nId tbe manuractnring of bleaching\npowders and In -the clilorlnatlon\' of\ncertain gold ores. , ,\nOne of tbe main fnurces of salt Is\ncommon sea water and tjonie of the\nCalifornia product is .obtained .\'rom\nthe oceao. When sea water is evap\norated to dryness, salt is among the\nfirst compounds to be deposited,. - T be\nlast are tbe potash and magnesiutv\ncompounds, these being the most sol\nuble. The great Stassfurt potash de\nposits are overlain as well at under\nlain by salt, and It is tbe opinion of\ngeologists tbat potash may accom\npaoy some of the known salt deposits\nin this country., , . ,\n. SOURCE OV POTASH. ,, s\nIn a recent geological survey report\non potash, written by Mr. l\'halen, tbe\nhope Is expressed tbat every salt pro\nducer io the United Sutcs will, la tbe\nfuture, wben boring or otherwise ex\nploring for salt, be o r.he lookout for\npossible occurrences of potash com\npounds, s At present the geological\nsurvey has a deep-drilling party at\nwork, in the arid West, where vast\ndeposits of salt are known to exist, In\nan endeavor to find p)sslhle sources of\npotash and nitrate of sodatwo of\ntbe three essential elements of "com\nplete fertilizer," a recognl.ed noevs\nalty for successful a jtrlciiHure. ,\nMr. I\'halen\'s report on salt and Dro\nmine-Is Issued as an advance cbnptcr\nfrom "Mineral Resources for 1110,"\nand may be obtained on application\nto tbe Director, United fetate Ueolog\nDust, prevention and road preserva\ntion aro utmost inseparable subjects\nIn the study of wood roads, so Insist\nently demanding the attention of\nroad engineers and tiberuUU-ietetest-ed\nIn modern road ; eonstructlun.\nTherefore the bulletin of the United\nSlates department of agriculture on\nMethods for.the Examination of Bitu\nminous itoad Materials, prepared by\nthe office of public roads, and Issued\nm No. 38 of that series, which\' con\ntains completo descriptions of \' the\nmethods of examination for that class\nof materialH, as employed at .present\noy tnat onicu, should mmrfrially fur\nther the adoption of standard meth\nods, a matter which Is of the utmost\nimportance at this time. ; .\nThese methods are presented in\nsuch a form that any Intelligent per\nson may, with a little practice and\nthe proper equipment, make such ex\namination. With this object in view\nthe bulletin describes the various\ntests In greater detail tbao would\nhave been necessary for tbe use of\nchemists, and illustrations are pre\nsented of practically all the apparatus\nrenulrnd. Also a list of the necessary\nequipment for a small laboratory\nabout to enuage In the routine left\nlug and inspection nf bitumens It\ngiven.

In fact,\nafter diligent search Into this particu\nlar violation of law, we bave found\nonly one Indictment for unlawful re-\ntall of liquor.\nAs to ptber violations, we believe\ntbat our county will compare very\nfavorably with any other county In\nthe state as to the small amount of\nsuch crimes happening within the\ncounty limits..\nMANY WITNESSES.\nWe beg to report that we have ex\namlned 114 witnesses and have found\n20 true bills of Indictment.\nNecessarily many matters bave\nbeen Investigated by tbe grand Jury\nwhlcb bave not resulted to the re\nturning of Indictments, but tbls ta as\nusual, and the facts In such cases did\nnot warrant tbe finding of indict\nment.\nAfmt4t4tyaM4)alajmfBeaa slaaaaalMaaMAtiaAbI\nbrought io your\ntuntion\nIn Itartlrftlaf we ns lflmed IhWi\nhe enfidiHt\'B of the eoiihty e,tf icm\nnd find that Hut i,eny HmM lo\nurnel treatment by the ixiftvlci May\nNiati have not been aiilttantlated\nWa ree\'im\'tiend, rmwever, that In the\ntil MM, when It la found heeeeesry to\nwhip a convict, that tbey be not\nhipped on the naked body, but that\npunishment M administered on the\noutside of f,h) clothing of said con-\nlet.
