        <pre>['945       November 2017, Vol. 107, No. 11\nIN PRACTICE\nThe dilemma following completion of \ngeneral paediatrics training\nThe prospect of seeking a career after completing the 4 years of \nregistrar training in general paediatrics is an increasing cause of \nanxiety for newly qualified specialists in South Africa (SA). In most \nregions, the prospects for employment are limited. Options include \nappointment to one of the few consultant positions in state hospitals, \nworking in the private sector, or continuing to train in a subspecialty. \nMany may struggle to find regular employment and resort to locum \nwork, which is not necessarily at specialist level. This could include \novernight on-site calls, and other work well below a specialist level of \nexperience. Subspecialty training positions may be undertaken as a \nmeans to maintain a further 2 - 3 years of full-time employment and/\nor to increase the likelihood of successfully securing a future statesector\nconsultant post in an increasingly competitive environment.\nIt could be argued that there is a greater need for confident and \nexperienced generalists to establish and run units, wards and services \nacross all levels of care. This is particularly relevant in the African \nsetting, where the layering effect of multiple burdens on health \nresults in children with complex problems presenting to general \npaediatricians.\nAnother unfortunate scenario is that some newly qualified \nspecialists feel that they are left with no option other than to enter the \nprivate sector, or to practise abroad, thus exacerbating the SA medical \n‘brain drain’. This misalignment of medical career trajectories of \nthe African health workforce needs has been reported. [1,2] These \nsentiments and concerns were strongly echoed in a recent survey \nconducted at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital \n(RCWMCH), Cape Town, among newly qualified paediatricians and \nregistrars who were nearing completion of their training. The survey \nwas designed to gain insight into a number of potential concerns that \nthese doctors might have related to career trajectories after general \nspecialist training. The questions assessed their opinions about \nadequacy of training, employment options and the trend towards \nsubspecialty training v. the idea of general paediatrics as a long-term \ncareer. The results confirmed fears about many of the aforementioned \nscenarios, and revealed an impressive consistency in the answers \nand opinions around these issues. A preference for remaining as \ngeneralists in state practice if the option were open to them was also \nnoted.\nJustification for an African hospitalist \ntraining programme\nNewly qualified specialists who attain employment as general \npaediatric consultants often find themselves in the unenviable \nposition of having to ‘take the reins’ and run a service without access \nto more experienced consultant advice and mentorship into the \nconsultant role. The respondents of our survey consistently raised \nconcerns about the lack of adequate training in leadership and \nmanagement, child protection services, and palliative care.\nThe scope of clinical practice changes significantly from being a \nground-level registrar at the ‘front line’ to taking up the baton of clinical \ngovernance and being the overall co-ordinator of clinical services, \nwho needs to take a ‘step back’ and appreciate a bird’s-eye perspective. \nGood communication and leadership skills are crucial to navigating \nthese issues. Having on-site subspecialist support, readily available in \nmost tertiary centres, can blind the physician to the reality of clinical \ndecision-making and hospital practice. Furthermore, many so-called \n‘subspecialty’ management decisions should actually be within the \ngeneralist’s scope of practice. The generalist must have sufficient \nconfidence and practical knowledge of a wide array of subspecialties to \nmake management decisions when subspecialty support is unnecessary \nor unavailable, and yet also needs to know when it is appropriate \nto enlist that support if available. While the training gained in the \nUniversity of Cape Town (UCT)’s general paediatrics programme is \nextremely comprehensive and the results are superb, there is still little \ncapacity for advanced training and grooming in all these areas during \nthe 4-year specialist training period.\nThe definition of a hospitalist\nWhile the term ‘hospitalist’ may be foreign to many SA health \npractitioners, the concept and overall philosophy behind the idea \nThis open-access article is distributed under \nCreative Commons licence CC-BY-NC 4.0.\nThe African Paediatric Fellowship Programme is rolling out a training course for newly qualified paediatricians to equip them with the \nleadership skills to function in complex general paediatric settings. The care of children in Africa carries its own unique demands, from the \nlayering effects of multiple conditions through to establishing and sustaining services under severe resource constraints. This novel training \nconcept aims to strengthen confidence and knowledge in areas that are not priorities during standard general paediatric training. The skills \ngained are considered of great relevance in assisting general paediatricians to achieve their full potential in their careers.\nS Afr Med J 2017;107(11):945-947.

It is traditionally defined as a physician who primarily \ndedicates his or her practice to the care of hospitalised patients \nand whose activities include patient care, teaching, research and \nleadership related to hospital care.[3] The daily practice of state-sector \nhospital-based general paediatricians in SA fulfils all the criteria to be \nconsidered a hospitalist model of care. Clinicians in centres such as \nGeorge Regional Hospital already practise at this specialised level of \npaediatric practice, but they have had to equip themselves with these \nskills through a slow process of exposure and assimilation. Clinicians \nin these centres were also interviewed and confirmed that they had \ntaught themselves the skills to function as ‘African hospitalists’.\nHow the hospitalist differs from \ncommunity paediatrics and child \nhealth training\nThe newly established subspecialty in community paediatrics and \nchild health addresses the issue of improving community-wide \nchild health. This curriculum focuses on the healthcare needs \nof all children across a system or region, with district health \nservices supported by integrated and mutually supportive referral \nsystems with general specialist (regional) and tertiary hospitals.[4] The \npaediatric hospitalist and the community paediatrician are different \nentities. The former is primarily inpatient focused, as opposed to \nthe more primary ‘preventive’ or chronic care role of the latter. In \nan African context, a certain amount of overlap is inevitable. While \noptimised primary care is the goal, with a decreased need for reactive \nhospital-based care of preventable illnesses, for the foreseeable future \nhigh volumes of acutely ill patients, often patients with complex \nproblems, who will require quality and skilled inpatient management, \nare a reality of Africa.\nThe required model for an ‘African hospitalist’ would therefore \nbe an adaptation of the original hospitalist concept whereby the \nhospitalist provides hospital-level care but remains responsible for \na limited amount of outpatient (and some focused outreach) care. \nFrom the patient’s and family’s point of view, this is an important \nquality assurance thread for the continuity of care, whereby patients \nare guaranteed transition back into primary care with no loss of \nquality care and with great patient satisfaction. The communication \nand integration with the community-based family physician is key \nand does much to enhance holistic care.\nThe pilot programme of the  \nAfrican hospitalist\nA newly qualified specialist trainee (ADD) commenced a pilot \nproject with the African Paediatric Fellowship Programme (APFP) \nin the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at UCT to \naddress the task of training paediatric hospitalists.[5] The aim was \nto create a new 1-year fellowship curriculum, targeting trainees \nin the immediate post-accreditation period (equivalent to a ‘year \n5’ following general paediatrics specialisation) and designed to \naddress the issue of successful transitioning into the role of a \nhospital-based general paediatrics consultant, namely an ‘African \npaediatric hospitalist’.\nThe strategy of the APFP is to partner with as many academic \nAfrican institutions as is feasible, where there is an identified \nneed. Since its inception in 2007, over 80 fellows have trained \nor are currently in training in general paediatrics or paediatric \nsubspecialties. Returning home to immediately take charge as the \nlead consultant with the responsibility of setting up and running a \npaediatric service is a reality for many APFP fellows.\nDuring this pilot programme ADD took on a consultant role in \nthe two general medical wards as well as in the short-stay ward and \nmedical emergency department, with autonomy but also consultant \nmentorship. Experience was gained in leading consultant ward rounds \nto formulate management plans, co-ordinating ward morbidity \nand mortality, as well as multidisciplinary meetings (including \npalliation and advanced care planning), teaching and mentoring of \njunior medical staff, child protection team meetings and focused \n‘up-skilling’ through work in selected subspecialty clinics.\nADD regularly fed back his experiences and suggestions to the \nproject supervisors, who included a senior member of the APFP \nand two general paediatricians at RCWMCH. The feedback served \nas a launch pad for further ideas and suggestions to try to build and \noptimise the core curriculum.\nIn addition to clinical work, the fellowship has integrated a \nleadership and management training module, which is deemed \nessential to develop this skill set. Also included is exposure to \npalliative care interventions. Outreach activities with key peripheral \nhospitals, as well as a rotation to a secondary-level neonatal unit, were \nalso considered essential to the training experience. Neonatal services \nand focused outreach both fall within the hospital paediatrician’s \nscope of work.\nThe role of the mature general hospital paediatrician goes well \nbeyond the ability to manage inpatient wards. Resource management, \ndeveloping and implementing guidelines, auditing throughputs and \nhandling critical events, as well as control consultations to help \nmature the hospitalist, are all important components of the hospitalist \ntraining.\nThe feedback from the pilot project has been overwhelmingly \npositive and ADD has gained valuable transitioning experience, \nboosting his self-confidence to fulfil a senior clinician and leadership \nrole. Furthermore, he reported feeling appreciated as a generalist \nclinician and that his input and service have added much-needed \nstaff capacity and value at RCWMCH. The survey also revealed \na keen interest in and overwhelming support for the hospitalisttraining\nconcept from the registrars nearing training completion, and \nalso from other newly qualified paediatricians.\nTo assess senior medical staff opinion of the fellowship, a second \nsurvey was conducted among those consultants at RCWMCH who \nwere responsible for mentoring and supervising ADD during the \nproject. These included both generalist and subspecialist consultants. \nOpinions on the impact and benefit of a hospitalist fellow on the \nward as well as the potential benefits to the trainee were unanimously \npositive. Furthermore, their recommendations for important content \nto be included in the fellowship curriculum were very much in line \nwith our own.\nConclusion\nWhile this programme has the training needs of the APFP trainees \nfrom outside SA in mind, ultimately any newly qualified paediatrician, \nincluding SA candidates, could benefit. This is especially true for \nthose aspiring to be primarily hospital based and for the participants \nin the RCWMCH survey who unanimously supported the concept. \nWith enough buy-in from key stakeholders, we can work towards \nmaking this an option for SA candidates as well and address the \nongoing need for effective paediatric hospitalists throughout Africa, \ninclusive of SA.\nKey points\n• A new clinical fellowship for an adapted model of the ‘hospitalist’ \nconcept for an African setting has been proposed and piloted at \nRCWMCH in Cape Town.\n• The fellowship aims to transition and better equip the newly \nqualified paediatrician with the required skills to become a \n', '947       November 2017, Vol. 107, No. 11\nIN PRACTICE\ncompetent and versatile hospital-based consultant paediatrician in \nan African setting – an African hospitalist.\n• The pilot programme has been successful in boosting the confidence\nand skills of the pilot fellow, and has gained the overwhelming \nsupport of the RCWMCH consultant staff.\nAcknowledgements.
