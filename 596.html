TIMERHOFF, Druggil., DIAMOND R.OBBER.Y., m, V, t, $12,000 Worth of Goods Stolon From, George H. Cook & Co. of Phoo-, nlx Robbery Occurs at Blsbee., The largest diamond robbery that, was ever perpetrated in Arizona, and, probably the largest robbery of any, kind, except, perhaps, of some bullion\', hold up-, in the early days, occurred at, Bisbee Thursday evening, the victims, being George H. Cook & Co., of this, city, through their representative, A., W. Crawford., The Cook Company is well known all, over the territory, as it is the largest, jewelry house in Arizona, having stores, in Phoenix, Prescott, Jerome and, Tucson, and through traveling repre, hentatives supply as well nearly every, camp in the territory by their frequent, visits. Mr. Crawford, who has been, connected with the firm fora long time,, makes Bisbee about \' once in three, months, carrying with him a good, stock of goods. But on this trip he had, a greater .supply of goods than usual,, owing to the approaching Christmas, trade. His goods were displayed iji the, store of Mrs. J. R. Blewctt, who deals, in ladies\' furnishings, and Thursday, evening the store was locked up while, all went to supper., On their return they discovered that, a thief had entered through a window,, taken a large telescope containing the, diamonds, and, opening it, removed the, jewels, making his escape through the, back door, which he unlocked from the, inside. Though the robbery is re, ported as diamonds, it is probable that, the goods secured were partly jewels of, some other kind, as it is said the thief, took everything in sight, except a, couple of chains; which he left in the, telescope in his haste., Though the robberv was discoveted, but a short time after it occurred, and, was immediately reported to the offi, cers, at last accounts no arrests had, been made., Inquiry was made at the local store, of the company last night for further, particulars regarding the robbery, but, Mr. Cook is absent in Prescott, and the, gentleman in charge here refused to, discuss the matter in any way. Mr., Cook is expected home from Prescott, this morning. Republican., Death of Sexmuel Crozler., Samuel Crozicr died at his home at, Truxton last Thursday afternoon of, heart failure.

Before the ar, rival of the train he was taken suddenly, ill and died in a very short time., Sam Crozier came to this county, about thirty years ago and for some, years engaged in mining, after which, he became interested in cattle raising., He was here during the stormy days, when a white man\'s life was never safe., Here he built up a fortune in the cattle, business, afterward investing latgely, in real estate in Kingman and Califor, nia. Among all the men residing in, Arizona there were none so univer, sally loved and respected as was Sam, Crozier. He was an ideal man in every, respect, and to have his friendship was, to give one a higher and better regard, for mankind in general. In Kingman, his death has cast a shadow of gloom, that time alone cannot dispel. He, leaves a wife and seven children to, mourn his loss., Yesterday all that was mortal of, Sam Crozier was laid to rest near the, home at Truxton he loved so well., Many of his old friends from Kingman, were present at the funeral.

A tight was made on Otero, which caused him considerable trouble., The copper stocks are tumbling, says, the Mining Reporter. The fall is alto, gether too great to be due entirely to, weakness and there seems to be one of, those perennial "bear" raids we are so, familiar with.

Stod, dard bf President Roosevelt this week, ends Ajlittle fight among a number of, ArlzonVrvrepublicans for. that office., Mr. Stoddard was appointed to tho, office in June last by President McKin, ley, and an effort was made to have, Roosevelt make another appointment., Charges were made against Secretary, Stoddard, accusing him of using official, envelopes in sending private letters, through the mail. The charges were, investigated and Stoddard exonerated., Mr. Stoddard, who has been In Wash, ington for some time past, is now on, his way home to resume tho duties of, his office., THE FOREST CONSOLIDATION., The board of supervisors at a special, meeting held on Wednesday wisely de, cided to send a delegation to Washing, ton to see what can be done in regard, to obtaining some relief from the pend, ing consolidation of the prlvute lands, with the present forest reserve. Should, the consolidation take place it would, include the grunt lands of tho railroad, company, the Perrin lands and tho Sag, inaw H Manistee Lumber Company\'s, lands and consequently these lands, would not be subject, to taxation, there, by reducing tho taxable property many, thousands of dollars, and with the de-, lino invyaiues or the remaining prop, rtv and the removal of tho sheen from, the reservation Coconino county would, have a hard time to keep up necessary, expenses., The necessity, for a forest reserve In, \'oconlno county may seem urgent to, tho Washington authorities, but it does, not follow that a prosperous section, should be .thrown into bankruptcy for, tho sole purpose of making a forest re, serve. The matter was up before tho, secretary of tho interior early in the, year, and it was then concluded that, tho consolidation would not be made., But slnco President Roosevelt\'s Incep, tion into ofllou the parties desiring the, consolidation have presented the mutter, to him and It seems he has approved, the consolidation scheme, and has done, so without full knowledgo of the true, slate of the conditions here, und tho, statement of only one side of tho pur-, ties in intorcst, and that they have, carefully held buck the fact that the, consolidation would practically ruin, this county. The consolidation would, be of great protit to the private land, owners, as by the agreement with tho, government they are allowed to select, government lands elsewhere in tracts, to suit their convenience, and as a, large portion of the lands included in, the consolidation contain no timber, and are practically valueless, the ex, chun\'go would be of considerable profit, to the land owners and a loss to the, government., INFORMATION TO STOCKMEN, Of Interest to Those Who Graze Stock, on the Forest Reserves., The government requires that all, persons who wish to graze their- stock,, (meaning cattle and horses) should, make application for grazing permits, in sufficient time so that there will be, no lapse of the old permit issued. All, grazing permits issued expire either, December 31st, 1001, or before that, time., Grazing permits are Issued for the, calendar yeur only, that is. from Janu, ary 1st, 1002, to December 31st, 1002,, and may include sufficient lands within, the reserves to graze the number of, cattle or horses actually owned by set, tlers, to graze upon range usually occu, pied by them., In making applications all blanks, should be properly filled out, giving, the number of cattle and horses sepa, rately, If it is desired to graze both;, give tho number grazed lust year sepa, rately, und see that applications are, properly dated, signed und witnessed., If grazing permits are not Issued for, all the time that stock are allowed to, grazo on the reserves by their owners,, the rules of the reserves makes it nee, essary to bring suits against them for, trespass. It is to the interest of stock, men to seo that they have permits, und, that applications are made out in time, to cover the whole grazing season., Blank applications and other Infor, mation may be received by addressing, Forest Supervisor F.

Furthermore,, Mr. R. B. Burns, chief engineer of the, Santa Fe Railroad Company, located, at Los Angeles, stated the same thing, in the hearing of Messrs. E. S. Gos, ney, J. Aubineau and John Marshall., The statement to the board of lire un, derwriters was ill-advised and erron, eous. It is true that after the reser, voir was repaired and filled to over, flowing there was moisture and, at, places, a little water was oozing through, the ground on the west and southwest, side of it, but the cause of the same is, as yet unknown. When the overflow, discharge pipe was lowered eighteen, inches below the place where it was, at, the place where it is now, and where it, was intended to be placed by your con, structing engineer, this moisture was, not noticed any more.

So numerous and misleading, lire many of the titles- that the pro, fessors do not understand them them, selves, and it was this fact which, caused them to become so desperate, aR to be wished to be called the plain, appellation "mister.", Speaking of the innovation.
