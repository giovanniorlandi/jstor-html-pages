(By MailvJTo\nthe Paris perfecture of police belongs\nthe distinction o having inaugurated\nwhat is probably the world\'s first of-\nflciaJ municipal humor censorship.\nIt is imposed to protect "the dig\nnity of the office of the President of\nthe.

To\npersonify these traditions, whether\nacting as principal speaker at a ban\niquet, host- to a royal or distinguished\nvisitor from a foreign country, or as\nofficial head of the government, is\nprobably the most important part of\nthe President\'s job.\nDeschanel best-dressed- man in\nFrance, famous for grace, social tact\nand perfect bearing, seemed to meet\nthis requirement ideally.\nUnder these circumstances, the\nnature of the President\'s accident was\niv. itself a severe blow to the pride of\nFrench elite, ft wrankled to think\nof the President having become the\nlaughing stock of the world, if even\nfo a doy.\nWhen, to make matters worse, the\nstage folks began gleefully rubbing it\nin, supplemening all the ridiculous\nthere was in the incident .with imag\ninary details anything but compli\nmentary to the President, France\'s\nOld Line protested. Scenes became\ncommon in Paris heatres, spectators\nrising in their seats to complain\nagainst a joke that "went too far."\nFilially the police applied the gag.\nThe, jesters knew no limit. They\neven quesibned the sincerity: of:\nthe\nchief executive\'s tumble, making!in\nsinuations which reflected, upon Etes\nchanel\'s morals.\nSongs recounted an imaginary\nflirtation, between, the President and\nthe section-worker\'s wife,\' Which, it\nwas insisted, really prompted his leap\nfrom his berth.\nOthers enlarged upon the "clean\nfeet" story (the good wife told a\nnewspaper man the day after the ac\ncident she suspected Deschanel\'s gen\nteel origin Immediately when she saw\nhis feet were clean!) adding explana\ntory details.\nSome applauded the President for\nhaving introduced the pajama into\nthe interior of France. (It probably\nis true that many peasants had never\nheard of a pajama.) The bard re\ncited all experiences in correcting this\nignorance, ultimately culminating in\ntheir discarding the time-honored\n"robe de nuit" (nightgown).\nLANGOTSLEAD\nOVERFRAZP\ni\nEach Paid Fin* of IS for VfeU\ntion of, Antomobik SpoWl\nLaws ia City Umfc*\nbfn^^ a number .of accidents Within\nfa,\nI\nof tlie eit of BcmtdJi Con\nlocal\npoliceeforce\nha\nThe Pioneer Mesaber f the Ualted Pr*M-USM* Wt* ftervleeToday\'s World News Today\nONEPUSAI\nfor Unifcutl SUtea\nBURTNCRS NOMINATED\nFOR rUSPItESENTATIVE\nIndketiens A That Later\nRoturns Will Giro\nFrazier Lead\nWith four hunred precincts to hear\nfrom out of a total of 2,064, Laager\nis leading Frazier for gubernatorial\nnomination of North Dakota by about\n1,000 votes.
