They look very much\nas they did when they went\noverseas the able-bodied\nones. You can see changes,\nIf you look close, but In the\nmain they are the same\nsmiling, jolly, clean, decent,\ngood-natured American boys. No wonder the\nFrench loved them for their looks and their ways,\nwondered If It was possible that they really could\nfight and went delirious with ecstasy when they\nput the Hun on the run nnd kept him going!\nWell, the generations to come, who cannot see\nthese American heroes in the flesh, will have the\nchance to see a few of these heroes in official por\ntraits. Joseph Cummlngs Chase, well-known portrait\npainter, who went overseas In October on a spe\ncial mission for the War college, has returned.\nHe brought with him 142 portraits, including a\ncomplete set of likenesses of the American gen\nerals overseas save four, which he will be com\npelled to pnlnt here. There are 72 portraits of\ngenernls, 50 of privates, "noncoms" and lieuten\nants who performed especially noteworthy serv\nice; 20 are pictures of officers of various grades.\nMr. Chase was selected by the War college to\npaint these portraits, which are to be Incorporated\nInto the official history of America\'s participation\nin the great war.\nDoubtless the generals and other officers of high\nrank are all Imposing in looks, but their portraits\nhave been published before. It Is quite likely pop\nular interest In these official portraits will run\nlargely toward those of the fighting men. Some\nbody said: "No army Is bigger than Its \'buck\nprivates.\' " He said something.\nThe four portraits here reproduced out of 18 at\nhand are the selection of the etcher and not of the\nwriter ; so It Is clear that reproduction quality and\nnot the record of the soldier determined the\nchoice. Yet this choice, haphazard as to deeds,\nshows clearly the marvelous qualities of the\nAmerican soldier. Here Is what the four did, in\nbrief:\nLieut. Philip Benson, One Hundred and Eighty\nfifth Aero Squadron. During the lust three weeks\nof the fighting Lieutenant Benson made trips\nnightly over German towns, dropping hundreds of\nbombs nnd fired thousands of rounds of ammuni\ntion into Hun supply trains. Of the pursuit group\nto which he belonged, only two pilots remained\nnlive. His father Is a well-known New York arch\nitect, and his uncle is the famous puinter, Frank\nBenson. Work like this requires a different sort\nof courage from that of the charge In the heat of\nbattle. Let your imagination go along with this\naviator, alone in the heavens at night over the\nenemy country, nnd make your own estimate of\nthis city boy, well-bred, educated and refined and\nof native Americnn stock. Keep In mind, too, that\naviators have to be just about 100 per cent per\nfect mentally nnd physically, and In a sense aro\nvolunteers.\nCorp. Mlsczyslaw Brocki, Company B. Sixteenth\nInfantry, First Division. South of Soissons on\nJuly 21, Corporal Brocki came to the conclusion\nthat the Germans had too many machine guns. He\npicked out the two that were causing the heaviest\nlosses to his company, went out single handed\nnnd captured those two particular guns, with\nevery Boche pertaining thereto. His citation says\nthis was only one Incident of Corporal Brocki\'s\nactivities. This man Is of Polish birth or blood,\naccording to Chsse evidently one of thoje "tem\nperamental" fellows.\nCorporal Walter E. Gaultney, Eleventh In\nfantry, Fifth Division. Corporal Gaultney was\npicked out by his commander as an example of\nhis finest type of soldier. Gaultney was wounded;\nthat couldn\'t stop him. Alert, ingenious, speedy,\nheedless of personal danger, he went at the Hun\nlike Samson with the well-known jaw bone only\nthis young Samson\'s Jaw bone was tlint nice long\ntrench knife you see strapped along his pack.\nJust what this young fellow did Is not told ; evi\ndently he Is a natural-born fighter nnd the regular\narmy training has made him pretty nearly 100 per\ncent efficient as an all-around fighting man.\nPrivate H. J. Devereuux, Company M, One Hun\ndred and Twenty-fifth Infantry, Thirty-second di\nvision. When his company crossed the River\nOurcq and captured the Bois Pelger, the corporal\nof his squad fighting beside Private Devereaux\nwas wounded by machine gun fire. The corporal\nfell to the ground and the enemy continued to fire\non the wounded man. Mad clear through, Dever\neaux sprinted across the open and, single-handed,\nattacked and put the machine gun out of action.\nGreatest Feat of War.\nIt is also known that Chase has painted a por\ntrait of Sergt, Alvln C. York of Pall Mall, Fentress\ncounty, Tenn., Company G, Three Hundred and\nTwenty-eighth Infantry, Eighty-second division. It\nis to be hoped that the painter did a first-class job,\nfor York\'s exploit was probably the greatest indi\nvidual feat of the war. York, then corporal, on\nOctober 8, 1918, killed 20 Germans, captured 132\nprisoners, including a major and three lieutenants,\nput 35 machine guns out of business, end thereby\nbroke up an entire battalion which was about to\ncounterattack against the Americans on Hill 223\nin the Argonne sector, near Chatcl-Chehery. He\noutfought the machine gun battalion- with his rifle\nand automatic pistol. There were seven other\nAmericans with York, but It was York\'s fight and\nbut for him not a man of them would hate come\nout alive except as prisoner.\nMoreover, the man and his home and his sur\nroundings are intensely interesting, being entirely\nout of the ordinary. Here are a few outstanding\nfacts :\nHe was born December 13, 1886, standa 6 feet\nand tips the scales at 205 pounds. He Is red head\ned. He is a dead shot absolutely sure death with\neither rifle or automatic ; In the course of his fight\nhe killed a German lieutenant and seven men who\ncharged him from a distance of 20 yards. He is a\nfighter who gets cooler and cooler as the danger\ngrows.\nHe used to drink, gamble and swear. He quit\nIn 1915 and Joined the Church of Christ and\nChristian Union, of which he is second elder nnd\nsinging leader. He was a conscientious objector\nuntil convinced by Capt. E. C. B. Dunforth at\nCamp Gordon that the Bible proved it his duty to\nfight. He believes in a personal God and looks\nupon his successful exploit as a miracle. " \'Blessed\nis the peacemaker,\' " he says.\nHe Is a farmer and blacksmith and provides for\nhis mother, one brother and three small sisters;\nthe other six brothers. and sisters are married.\nHis forbears for generations were Tennesseenns.\nWhen York landed the other day the Tennessee\nsociety took possession of him and tried to make\nhim feel that New York city was his.\nOf course York was having the time of his life,\nyet really, you know, he was regretting that he\nwasn\'t home to lead the singing at the Possum\nTrot spring revival.\nAnd at the Possom Trot revival, In the valley\nof which Pall Mall, with its 20 houses, Is the cross\nroads metropolis, York\'s neighbors were prouder\nover the fact that he had \'kept straight" than\nover what he had done to the Hun. Besides, while\nAlvln was "all right," God had had him in charge\nsince the day he enlisted. "It wasnt Alvln." im\nGrace Williams, who Is waiting for him, "it wai j\nine nuuu vi uwi.\nWhich reminds us of the first words of th Hun\nm:Jor cuptured by York.\n"British?" he nskol.\nfork.\nFAMOUS OLD FANEUIL HALL.\nNEW YORK HAS\nLIBERTY BELL\nI iHJfl Liberty bell in Independ\nence hail, Philadelphia, is fa\nmous throuzhout the world.\nIts ringing proclaimed liberty July 4,\n1770, and ever since it has been sacred\nto ail Americans. Everybody knows\nall about that bell, but the New York\nHerald tells of another which played\na part In the stirring scenes of the\nrepublic\'s founding. The Herald says:\nHere In New York city is another\nliberty bell, a bell whose history is as\nremarkable as that of the Liberty bell\nIn Philadelphia, but which is practi\ncally unknown except to a few persons\nwho have delved into ancient records\nand documents concerning It.\nNew York city\'s liberty bell hangs\nconcealed in the belfry of the Dutch\nchurch at Fifth avenue and Forty\neighth street. It has been in New\nfork city since 1731.\nIt proclaimed liberty to the citizens\nJuly 9, 1776, when Gen. George Wash\nington read the adopted Declaration\nof Independence to the American\ntroops and asked for its accentance\nand ratification. Had the army not\nacclaimed liberty at that time and\nagreed to fight to death for freedom\nthe Declaration of Independence\nwould have become a worthless scrap\nof paper. But the army did acclaim\nliberty, aad the bell rane out the tid\nings here just as the other bell in\nI\'niiadeiphia bad done five days be\nfore. Legacy to Old Dutch Church.\nNew York cltv\'a Llbertv hell waa\ngiven as a legacy to the Dutch church\nby one of the oldest inhabitants of\nthis city, Abraham de Peyster, who\nserved as mayor, treasurer and coun\ncilor and as governor In 1701, and\nirhose statue now stands in the place\nof that of George in In the Bowling\nGreen.\nThe bell was cast In Amsterdam and\nbears an Inscription In Dutch, which,\ntranslated, reads:\n"I was made by Le Gravae and N.\nMuller, Amsterdam, 1731. Abraham de\nPeyster, bom July 8, 1657; died Aug.\nB, 1728. A legacy to the Dutch church,\nNew York."\nAlmost the first public service of the\nbell was tolling for the death of George\nL the German klnz of Grent Rritnin\nand announcing the succession of his\nson ueorge il it welcomed seven for\neign governors, from Admiral George\nClinton to Sir William Tyron, and in\nafter years called the citizens to de\nfend their rights or warned them of\ncalamities.\nAnd it hangs today, almost unknown,\nIn a dusty belfry in a most prominent\nposition In New York.\nIts Voice Still Resonant\nThis Liberty bell is not cracked; Its\ntone is as fine and sweet and resonant\nas on the day it rang at General\nWashington\'s command. Following\nare the more Important occasions upou\nwhich New York\'s Liberty bell was\nrung In the eighteenth century, from\nthe time It arrived In New York city\nIn 1731 until It proclaimed liberty in\n1776. The list has been compiled\nfrom colonial records and the history\nof New York and Is authentic in every\nparticular:\n1735 Announcing the liberty of the\npress.\n1741 Warning the citizens to pro\ntect themselves against the negroes,\nwho threatened to rise and murder\nthe whites.
