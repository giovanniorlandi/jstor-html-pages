PLAN FOR\nCOLLECTING FEES\nCall Issued For Meeting of All Sheriffs\nor Oklahoma at Guthrie Next\nMonday.\nChickasha, Okla., Jan. 7. The sher-\'\niffs of Oklahoma may hit upon a plan )\nul vuncv;i.iuii w iceo lutti\nwill aid the legislature, should it be\ncaned in special session, m arriving\nat a just basis respecting the office of\nsheriff. Sheriff M. B. Louthen of\nGrady county has issued a call for a !\nspecial meeting of the Oklahoma j\nSheriff\'s association, of which he is\nm\npresident, to be held in Guthrie, Jan- vere against any save those who have\nuary 10. Every sheriff in the state made trouble for the administration,\nis urged to attend. !not only on account of the tariff bill.\nThe circular letter which Sheriff but for insidious criticism of the ad\nLouthen has sent out says that owing ministration for failure to make more\nto the decision of the state examiner progress with the so-called Roosevelt\nand inspector that fees collected by policies. Notice was taken here today\na majority of the sheriffs of the state in a public way of the patronage con\nfor enforcement of the prohibition troversy between Senators Curtis and\nlaw have been illegally collected and , Bristow of Kansas, as follows:\nmust be returned to the counties, it ( "Senator Bristow of Kansas is one\nhas been deemed advisable by the of the men hung up by the adminis-\nofflcers of the sheriffs\' association to\'tration on the patronage proposition.\ncan a meeting or tnat organization j\nthat they may agree upon some uni-1\nform plan of charging fees in order \'\nthat the records of the sheriffs may\nbe uniform. . -\nIt is claimed by many sheriffs that\nwhen one state examiner audits their\nbooks he holds these fees are illegally\ncharged, while another examiner may\nfollow who will hold that the fees are\nlegal and may be collected. This has\ncaused much trouble and Inconveni\nence to sheriffs.\nThere are several laws in the terri-\ntorial statutes which were put in\nforce over the state by the constitu-;\ntion, under which sheriffs may collect\nfees, and some of them apparently\nauthorize a sheriff to draw the fees\nin excess of his salary. County attor\nneys are at variance on the matter as\nwell as county judges, who also have\nto do In a large measure with fees.\nTRANSITS HIS SPECIAL ,\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS\nBy Associated Press.\nWashington, D.

Presi\ndent Taft\'s special message dealing\nwith the amendments to the interstate\ncommerce laws, looking to more ef\nfective federal supervision of the rail\nroads and conveying his recommenda\ntions for the passage of a federal In\ncorporation act was transmitted to\ncongress today, and read in the house,\nthe senate not being in session. The\nmessage followed closely the fore\nrunners that have been made and in\ntue sussested legislation to the rail\nroads, embodies all of the suggestions\nthe president has made from time to\ntime, in speeches on the subject.\nBERGER ...\ncolors,\nss, Gloves, Underwear\nANTIPATHY GREAT 1 OW\nFOUR IS 1 SB\nKansas\' Fighting Senator Broaght Squarely Into\nLimelight-Is One of Those Hung on Patron\nage Proposition Doubt Expressed That\nAny Except Bristow, LaFollette, Clapp\nand Cummins Will Be Severely Pun\nished by Administration.\nWashington, Jan. 7.

Gifford Pin\nchot, chief forester, violated an order\noi the president when he wrote a let\nter to Senator Dolliver virtually up-\nholding L. R. Glavis, whom Richard\nBallinger, secretary of the interior,\ndismissed from the service. Mr. Taft\nhas ordered that no subordinate in\nany department should disclose in\nformation to congress except through\nthe head of the department. Mr. Pin\nchot is subordinate to the secretary\nof agriculture.\nAfter reading - the newspaper re- !\nports of the lively tilt in the senate j\nafter the reading of the Pinchot let-\'\nter President Taft sent a hurry call\nfor such members of his cabinet as\nwere within reach. Secretary Knox,\nsecretary MacVeagh, Attorney Gener\nal Wickersham and Secretary Wilson\ncame. It was said that Mr. Pinchot\'s\nconduct in sending an official com\nmunication to the chairman of the\nsenate committee on agriculture was\nfreely discussed, although none of the\ncabinet officers, who participated in\nthe conference, would discuss their\ncall to the White House in any way.\nIn his letter Mr. Pinchot not only\nupheld the criticisms of Secretary Bal\nlinger, but suggested that the presi\ndent himself had been mistaken in\nthe facts when he removed Mr. Glavis\nfrom the public service.\nMr. Pinchot said his\' ubordinates,\nreferring to Glavis and his assistants,\npossibly had been too free in giving\nout information. They had been zeal\nous in their efforts to protect the prop\ner\'y belonging to the government. He\nhad disciplined them for talking too\nmuch, but did not think they should\nbe punished further. He boldly took\nthe responsibility for what his sub\nordinates had done, and the very bold\nness of hi3 letter caused a Btir in the\'\nsenate.\nSenator Hale instantly saw the ef\nfect of this letter on the public. He\ncalled it a remarkable communication\nand said he hoped hig friend, from\nIowa, Senator Dolliver, was not. try\ning to have the matter prejudiced in\nthe public mind. .\n"I am surprised," he said, "that a\nARD\nThe final decision as to whether he\npendg t0 a iarge extent upon Mr\nBristow himself.\n"There are four fine federal appoint\npostofnees.

They\nwanted to wait. They had information\nthat Senator Bristow, who had fought\nthe tariff bill with a fierceness unus-\nual even with insurgents, was attack\'\ning the administration through his\nKansas paper. Almost every day it\nbreathed criticism of the administra\ntion. It called loudly for a man like\nRoosevelt as the head of the nation.\n"It has been even worse in Its at\ntacks than the covert methods of Sen\nator La Follette\'s magazine or the out\nspoken attacks of Senator Clapp of\nMinnesota, both of whom are in the\nnung-up class, like the well picked\nThanksgiving or Christmas turkey,\nsubordinate officer in one of the de\npartments should address to a sena\ntor a letter criticising a superior offi\ncer." \'i hen he said that is was an infrac\ntion of the president\'s rule that subor\ndinates in departments must refrain\nfrom discussing public business ex\ncept through their superiors. That\nPinchot had violated an order of the\npresident and for that reason made\nhimself liable to punishment, was the\nnatural inference from the senator\'s\nremarks. The suggestion , It carried\nwas that perhaps Pinchot and not\nBallinger will be the man actually put\non trial.\nDolliver would not rest under the\nimputation of "grandstanding" for the\npublic advertising purposes.

J. H. WORTMAN,\nSuperintendent.\nU\nENTHUSIASTIC MEETING OF THE\nCOMMERCIAL CLUB.\nSENTIMENT \'IS ONAN10US\nProposition For New Road Is Conceded\nto Be Most Tangible Ever Sub\nmitted to Vinita.\n"Get out raise the bonus," Such\nwere the instructions given the spe\ncial committee selected at the meet\ning of the Commercial Club to assist\nthe regular railroad committee, with\nreference to securing the new Osage\n& Western railroad, that has made a\nproposition to this city. The original\ncommittee is composed of L.F. Par\nker, chairman; Dr. Oliver Bagby, M.\nF. Knight and L. W. Bufflngton, and\nthe club increased the membership of\nthis committee to eight, by appoint\ning D. M. Marrs, T. E. Englehart, W.\nB. Coley and F. S. E. Amos to aid in\nthe work of raising this bonus.\nThe prospect of securing a new\nrailroad caused an unusually large at\ntendance at the Commercial club meet\ning, and from the discussion of the\nproposition that ensued it is reason\nably certain that Vinita will be there\nwith her end of the deal to secure the\nthe building of this railroad. The\nbuilding of this railroad.\nThe building of this railroad has met\nwith tne most unanimous favor of any\nproposition that has ever been pre\nsentedto this city. There are many\nreasons for this condition. The road\nis one that is admitted by all railroad\nmen to be a most plausible project,\nand one that will eventually be car\nried, out. The extremely low cost of\nconstructing Buch a line and the fact\nthat it will tap twelve north and south\nrailroads is an assurance that the\nroad would prove a great success,\nfinancially. These things together\nwith the high business standing, which\nMr. Walters, the promoter, has in\nbusiness circles and the fact that four\n\'ther county seat towns, along the\nproposed route, have signed contracts\nwith this company, has caused the\npopular impression that the building\nof the road is more than a possibility\nor a road built on paper, as have\nbeen many of the offers made to this\ncity. The members of the Commer\ncial club feel that this is the road\nVinita wants, and, from the sentiment\nexpressed last night, is going to get.\nThe railroad committee will make a\ncanvass of the town and if it is\nthought feasible a mass meeting will\nbe called at an early date, which Mr.\nWalters will probably attend, for the\npurpose of finalily entering into an\nagreement for the construction of the\nroad. ;\nThe railroad discussion occupied ,\nnearly the entire evening, and the\nonly other business transacted was j\nthe hearing of a proposition or rather\na suggestion from Mr. Violet, of Mc\nAlester, to move a flouring mill from\nthat city to Vinita. Mr. Violet was\nnot in position to make a definite prop\nosition to remove the mill here, but\nstated tbat he was most favorably im\npressed with the outlook for a mill\nhere, and would within the next few\ndays submit a proposition to the club.\nThe directors failed to meet yes\nterday afternoon and select a secre\ntary as was intended, but will do so\nbefore the next meeting.\nDftlCC\nBONUS\n(ILL llttlJL\nFOR\nJEW RAILROAD\nCITY FIVE MONTHS\nBEHIND II LEW\nCHANGE OF ENDING OF FISCAL\nYEAR RESPONSIBLE.\nHEARING MANDAMUS CASE\nStartling Revelation Is Made In Con\ndition of City\'s Finances By\nMayor\'s Investigation.\nThat no tax "Jvy was ever made for\nthe running expenses of the city of\nVinita or for the requirements of the\nsinking fund for the various\nbond issues during the period\nfrom February 1, 1908 to Jnly\n1 1, of the same year, is the\nstartling fact that has just come to\nlight, through the Investigation of the\ncity\'s financial condition, brought\nabout by the mandamus proceedings,\ninstituted by G. P. Fogle for the col-V\nlection of a judgment against the city. \'\nThe discovery of this oversight by\nthe former administration was found \'\nby Mayor Rider, in preparing the de\nfense in the mandamus proceedings.\nAn ordinance was passed by the form\ner city council on August 7, 1908, levy\ning a \'tax for the expenses of the city\nfor tlft fiscal year ending July 1, 1909\nbut no mention is made of the period\'\nfrom February 1, to July 1, 1908.\nThe reason\' for this failure to make\na levy Is thought to have been a\nfailure of the former council to note\nthe change in the ending of the fiscal\nyear in the cities of the old Indian\nTerritory. Under the old Arkansas\nstatutes the fiBcal year ended on Feb\nruary 1, but when Oklahoma became\na state, the Oklahoma statutes were\nextended over this part of the state\nand changed the end of the fiscal year\nfrom February 1 to July 1. The coun\ncil in making the annual levy con\nsidered the fiscal year of 1908 as end\ning July 1, 1909, and the levy made\nwas not sufficient to cover the extra\nfive months so it h thought no levy\nwas made for tbat time.\nThe Fogle mandamus\', proceeding\nis being heard in the county court\nthis afternoon. Mayor Rider and\nCity Attorney Hobdy appeared on be\nhalf o,f the mayor and council. The\ndefense filed a demurrer to the Is\nsuance of ;\'the writ of mandamutf, bas\ned upon tie contention that the city\nhas no fund from which it can pay the\njudgment at this time. It Is the opin\nion of Mayor Rider that the council \'\ncannot authorize the payment until\nafter the next tax levy is made, when ,\na special levy, will have to be made\nto pay the judgment. This will mean\nthat the judgment cannot be paid,\nuntil after the collection of taxes for\'\nnext year,\nThe arguments in the case are ie-j\ning heard thi?

"The Little Homestead," is\neffectively told in four acts, is in-\ntensely interesting and very pathetic.\nThe first act introduces a happy little\nhome in a New England village broken\nup by a villian who wishes to wreak\nhis vengeance on a young husband.\nTne blind infatuation of a woman\nleads her to a sad and sorrowful fate,\nand contribution comes too late to\nmake amends; but virtue triumphs in\nthe end and the moral is properly im\npressed. Mr. William Macauley, a\ncapable and painstaking actor, will be\nseen as "Roy Carroll," a very difficult j\npart, in which he is spoken of very\nhighly by the press as playing with\nperfect ease. Mr. Macauley is well\nknown to our theatergoers for his ex\ncellent acting in different parts the\npast five years and his engagement\nhere will be the most popular event\nof the theatrical season.\nDepartment of Southwest.\nThe department of the Southwest\nof the Episcopal church will hold a\nthree days conference at Oklahoma\nCity, January 18, 19 and 20. This dis\ntrict comprises the states of Arkan\nsas, Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Louis\niana, Oklahoma, Arizona and New\nMexico territories. , Of the eleven\nbishops, eight or ten, with other visit\ning bishops, are expected. Probably\none hundred clergy with about the\nsame number of lay delegates will be\nin attendance. The Rev. James J.
