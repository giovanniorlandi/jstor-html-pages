In recent \nyears, Building Information Modelling for historic buildings (HBIM) projects are the most applied methods to transmit the richness \nof built heritage from both the geometrical and informative points of view, but they are not always adequate to ensure a simple \nreading of different type of information for not-expert users. For this reason, further investigations were performed, following a \nnovel SCAN-to-BIM process based on novel Grades of Generation (GOG 9 and 10) in order to digitally represent one of the most \ncomplex structure of the Basilica of Sant’Ambrogio in Milan. It is composed of arches supported by pillars, characterised by a \ndouble-wave curve, both on its vertical and horizontal axis. The information coming from the previous studies, such as historical \ndocumentation, as-found drawings, building archaeology analysis (materials and brick surface texture) and decay data (crack \npatterns, material discontinuity), was integrated with a novel web-immersive solution able to display 360° pictures, video and HBIM \nsimultaneously. A detailed comparison of the 360 multimedia data of the current arrangement with the one of the HBIM historical \nphases allow experts and not-experts to analyse the transformation of the arch structures in a new immersive environment with \ndifferent devices such as laptops, mobile phones and latest virtual and augmented reality (VR-AR) headset. \n1. INTRODUCTION\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) is quickly \nrevolutionizing the field of Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH). \nIn particular, Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) \nare gaining a lot of popularity since they can be properly used \nfor  documenting, archiving, preserving and visualising digital \ncultural heritage (Murphy, 2011). \nMoreover, HBIM based on detail 3D survey (laser scanning and \ndigital photogrammetry) is enabling holistic BIM-based cloud \nwhere interdisciplinary disciplines such as restoration and \npreservation of historic buildings can improve their own digital \nworkflow. \nTraditional digital process and 2D CAD drawings are updated \nwith new type of 3D representation able to convert 3D scans, \nalso known as point clouds, in 'informative' models. \nThis change of methods is called SCAN-to-BIM process, which \nallows professionals to accurately create digital models that \nfollow the detected reality from a morphological and \ntypological points of view with high levels of geometry (LOG) \nand information (LOI) (Brumana, 2018).  \nFurthermore, thanks to a precise digital reconstruction of the \ndetected artefact, it is possible to achieve digital workflows able \nto holistic transmit a different type of data and orient the model \nto different disciplinary sectors, bringing the traditional building \nmanagement techniques to a new level of information-sharing \n(Banfi, 2016).  \nOn the other hand, most of the time, all these types of data \nrequire advanced skills and knowledge of a wide range of postprocessing\nand modelling application such as Autodesk Recap, \nAutodesk Revit, MC Neel Rhinoceros and others.Restorers, \nstructural engineers and not-expert modelling users need \ninnovative solutions that avoid the direct use of BIM \napplications and easily display specific information for specific \nareas of expertise and interest.  \nIn fact, a SCAN-to-BIM method based on new modelling \nrequirements led the generation of one of the most complex \nhistoric building in Milan: the Basilica of Sant’Ambrogio in \nMilan. \nFrom a morphological point of view, thanks to the proper use of \nnovel grades of generation (GOG) and accuracy (GOA), it has \nbeen possible to create each architectural and structural element \nof the building with a deviation value (between point clouds and \nmodel) of about 1/2 mm, favouring structural and decay \nanalysis (Stanga, 2017).  \nThe approach required different application not easy to use for \nnot-expert users and a BIM-based cloud that allowed the \nsharing of all the data produced during the generative process. \nIn particular, the complex arch structure of the church required \nan ultra-detailed model able to show all the structural anomalies \nand the surface analysis. In particular, the arch structure is one \nof the hidden treasures of this well-known building. \nOn the northern side, it is hidden by Bramante’s Canonica, \nwhile on the southern side it is compromised by the chapels. For \nthis research, the focus is on the northern side, since it is more \naccessible and visible. The structure is composed of four arches \nsupported by pillars. Certainly, there were other two arches that \nwere demolished during the aerial bombing of the Second \nWorld War. Its complex geometry, characterised by a doublewave\ncurve, is probably the result of different construction \nphases and restorations. It was presumably built in the Middle \nAges (around the 12th century) and the reason for its \nconstruction is still unknown (Fig 1).  \nIn order to share, mainly to not-BIM expert users, all the \n‘hidden’ richness of this complex structure, further \ninvestigations on a new type of display were performed.  \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLII-2/W9, 2019 \n8th Intl.

RELATED WORKS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES \nIn recent years, the research applied to digital heritage (DH) \nproduced a wide variety of interesting system able to \ncommunicate a high quantity of information through the use of \ninnovative digital model, greatly increasing the awareness of the \nintangible values of the buildings examined among all the users \ninvolved in the process (Della Torre, 2008).  \nOne of the main fields of application of HBIM beyond the \nrestoration sector, is the mixed reality, in turn, composed of two \ndifferent types: virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) \n(Sherman 2018). \nBoth these types allow the creation of new environments and \nvisualizations where digital objects co-exist and interact in real \ntime. \nOne of the main advantages is the possibility of reusing HBIM \nmodels for the development of immersive environments where \nusers can immerse themselves in the first person and interact \nwith different types of content (Ioannides 2009).  \nThe development of these environments, on the other hand, \nrequires specific skills and knowledge of other types of software \nsuch as Unreal Engine and Unity (Schiavullo 2018). \nThese applications, mainly created for the development of video \ngames, led to the development of immersive environments \noriented to the built heritage, thus facilitating a direct interaction \nof historical models with specific contents of historical-cultural \ninterest. \nThe products of these applications are APPs that requires the \nuse of latest generation hardware devices: headset and \ncontrollers such as Oculus Rift, Sony Playstation VR and \nSamsun gear VR. \nFigure 2 summarizes the wide range of headset, controls and \nhardware types required by the most used VR devices in the \nfield of Digital Cultural Heritage.  \nFor this reason, the following research was aimed to generate an \nimmersive environment that did not require the use of these \napplications, software and hardware, trying to reduce the time \nof sharing information through a more sustainable and scalable \nsystem for not expert users. \nThe best solution was found in the development of a webservice\nsystem able to merge different data source such as \nHBIM and 360-degree panoramic pictures, creating a \ncomparison between different historic phase and decay analysis.  \n \n \nFigure 2. The different type of devices, headset and controls for \nVR projects. \n \nThe main goal was to support professional in an easy-reading of \narticulated information and complex geometry of the arch \nstructure of the church. Figure 3 summarizes the method applied \nto the case study of this research, relating the different data \nsources, the application used for each generative step and the \nrelated contents to the main research objectives. \n \n \nFigure 3. The digital workflow applied to the research case \nstudy. \n \nIn particular,  \n \n• The first goal was to intercept the morphological \nfeatures of the structure by different 3D survey \ntechnique in order to give to the HBIM generation the \nproper geometric bases. \n \n• The second research goal was to accurately represent \nthe model, applying new modelling requirements \n(GOGs & GOA) able to create an accurate digital \nmodel from different geometric primitives. \n \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLII-2/W9, 2019 \n8th Intl.

In order to improve the LOI, \ndifferent historic and on-site analysis were performed \nand linked to the model, this way all the richness of \nthe church was collected and digitalized. \n \n• The fourth objective was to convert specific \ninformation into a web-service solution able to shows \ndifferent model and historic information to not-BIM \nexpert users. \n \n \n \n3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY \n3.1 Data collection and 3D survey \nThe survey of the Basilica of Sant’Ambrogio was carried out in \ntwo different phases. In the first phase, the main nave of the \nbasilica and its four-side portico were surveyed while in the \nsecond phase the survey focused on the rear part of the apse and \non the arch structures. \nDuring the first epoch, a geodetic network was materialized and \nmeasured with a first order Total Station Leica TS30. \nThe network is made of 8 stations and after least squares \nadjustment the average precision on benchmarks was of about \n±1.0 mm. \nIn the second stage a new set of stations were added to the \noriginal network. Repositioning was performed by resection \nusing as benchmarks a set of retro reflective targets measured in \nthe first epoch.  \nThe scan acquisition was carried out with Faro Focus 3D. In \nparticular, to acquire the arch structure the instrument was \nplaced in the room close to S. Ambrogio’s room in order to \nrecord the arch n.3, in S. Ambrogio’s room for the arches n. 4, 5 \nand 6, and finally in the narrow corridor for the arch n. 7 for a \ntotal number of 5 scans (Fig 4). \n \nFigure 4. Point clouds data of the Basilica of Sant’Ambrogio. \n \nScans were registered with an average precision of ±3.0 mm by \nusing chessboard targets measured with the total station and \nadditional scan-to-scan correspondence (spherical targets).  \nA photogrammetric survey was carried out for each arch and \npillar, side and front walls and arch intrados. \nThe main aim of this was to realize orthophotos at the scale \n1:10. In order to process the data PhotoScan was used and a set \nof Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Check Points were \nderived from the laser scanning survey to constraint the \nreconstruction and verify the metric accuracy of the final \nresults. \nIn particular, considering Check Points a RMSE of about \n±0.0103m was obtained. The result depends on the fact that the \nCheck Points were identified by choosing significant points on \nthe point cloud. In this phase no targets were used. Those \northophotos were used as the basis for a detailed archaeology \nanalysis of this portion of the building.  \n \n \nFigure 5. The orthophotos were used as the basis for geometric \nand building archaeology analysis. \n \n3.2 Model generation: from geometric primitives to \ncomplex HBIM \nData collection and 3D survey provided different data sources \nsuch as historic documentation, accurate 3D scans and detailed \northophotos, to properly created an HBIM able to show the \ncomplexity from a morphological and typological point of view.  \nLaser scanning and digital photogrammetry allowed the \nidentification of complex geometries and lay the foundations for \nthe application of modelling requirements for SCAN-to-HBIM \nprocess. A grade of accuracy (GOA) of 1/2 mm was achieved \nthanks to the application of different grade of generation (GOG) \n(Banfi 2017). \nIn particular, in order to create a proper model able to show all \nthe detected complex shapes, the generative key was applied \nGOG 9 and GOG 10 at the same time. \nGOG 9 is based on the generation of NURBS from 3D \nwireframe. It is a modelling procedure that summarises the \nknown slicing technique. The traditional process of generating \n2D CAD models and drawings is essentially based on the \nmanual extraction of cross-sections from point clouds. The \nsections, usually used for technical drawings, are used as a \ngenerative basis for three-dimensional modelling in the digital \nspace. GOG 9, instead, bypassed 2D drawings and permitted the \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLII-2/W9, 2019 \n8th Intl.

They are controlled by a closed exterior edge and \ninternal section curves. In BIM application it was possible to \nrealise a 3D object with the related thickness of the strucutres \nselecting the NURBS surface previously produced. \nThe main parts of the structure required also the application of  \nGOG 10 (NURBS from a set of point) able to intercept the \ngeometrical and structural anomalies with a double curvature \ninherited from a millenary historical heritage. The generation of \ninternal curves able to intercept the irregular internal shapes of \nthe complex elements was substituted with 2 modelling \nrequirements. The tested method allowed the generation of \nhistoric elements interpolating a closed exterior edge (i) and a \nset of internal control points (ii). After the NURBS generation, \nin BIM application it was possible to realise a 3D object with \nthe related thickness selecting the surface previously produced. \nThis procedure allowed to bridge the modelling gap in \nAutodesk Revit (based on GOG1 to GOG 8) and to create a \nNURBS model able to accurately follow the 3D scans (Fig 6). \n \n \n \nFigure 6. The generative SCAN-to-HBIM process based on \nGOG 9 and GOG 10. Thanks to new modeling requirements it \nhas been possible to achieve high LOG and LOI. \n \n3.3 HBIM mapping: the proper connection of different \ninformation and data to the historic model \nThe study of the arch structure is essential for the understanding \nof the constructive and historical phases of the church. In \nparticular, it is crucial to shed further light on the Romanesque \nbuilding site, like the materials that were used (and reused), the \nbricks surface texture, and on the restorations that were carried \nout in the 19th and 20th centuries. The 11th-13th centuries are the \nperiod of the “rifabbrica romanica” (Romanesque reconstruction),\nwhen the church changed its appearance thanks to \nthe construction of the vaulted system, which replaced the \nformer wooden roof (Landriani 1889). However, few literatures \nfocused on the arch structure that were built almost at the same \ntime. Since the arch structure is relevant for the Romanesque \nphase, and it is still not promoted inside the basilica guided tour, \nit is important to easily show on the HBIM the historical \ninformation and construction data related to it. \nDifferent kind of data were linked to the HBIM, such as the \nphotogrammetry survey and orthophotos, historical drawings \nand pictures, architects’ reports and measurements, building \narchaeology stratigraphic units datasheets and Harris matrix, \nmaterials properties and external links to the Sant’Ambrogio’s \ncloud. The simple mapping of the HBIM with the orthopothos is \none of the main contributions to the knowledge of the arch \nstructure. It allows to show the detailed building archaeology \nanalysis that helps the understanding of the basilica and the \ndifferent construction phases of the arch structure (Fig 7). This \nis not part of a homogeneous design plan. First the pillars were \nbuilt, not in structural continuity with the basilica wall, then, the \narches in between the pillars were realized. It is clearly visible \nfrom two vertical signs that start at the impost of the arches and \ncontinue to the top of the pillars  \n \n \n \nFigure 7. Building archaeology analysis applied to arch n. 5. \n \nThe stratigraphic analysis datasheets include many information \nregarding each stratigraphic unit (masonry, plaster, etc.) that \nwere detected during the survey (stratigraphic relationship \namong the units, material characteristics, on-site observations). \nThanks to them, it is possible to know the different kind of \nbricks that were used. Most of them came from the former \nroman construction, like the thin roof tiles or the “suspensura” \nbricks, which were part of the round piers that supported the \nfloor of roman baths. The “motivo a mattonetti” is another \npeculiar characteristic of the Romanesque building site, which \ninvolved the reuse of roman bricks by placing them on rowlock \nlines or on herringbone patterns (Fieni 2004, Fiorani 2008). The \nmain used material is the brick, but some stones are adopted as \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLII-2/W9, 2019 \n8th Intl.

The mortar joints were instead \nprobably made in the 20th century, since it seems that the mortar \nis cement. \nThe addition of the material properties in the HBIM allows to \nfocus on the different bricks surface texture. Many bricks have \nscratches on their surfaces: some of them are straight, some are \n45° straight, others have a “chevron” pattern (Fig. 8).  \nThe scratches were usually realized before baking the bricks \nand it is common to find them on the Romanesque buildings. \nThe literature offers different opinions about their meaning: \nthey could be used to help the plaster to easily grip on the \nmasonry, or they could be a surface finishing and have an \naesthetical value (Fiorani 2008, Redi 2000). Some of them can \nperhaps be referred to the 19th or 20th century works, as “marks” \nmade by the restorers to distinguish with a different surface \ntexture the bricks that they added from the older ones. In fact, \nduring the 1850s-overall-church restoration, the single-lancet \nwindow of the side wall of the basilica (at the level of the \nmatronei) were enlarged in order to improve its interior \nlightening. That is why, it is possible to find many \nmisalignments between the mortar joints of the bricks of the \nwall and the bricks used to make the splayed jambs of the \nsingle-lancet windows. \n \n \n \nFigure 8. Material analysis. \n \nThe first records of the arch structure are some sketches by \nFernand De Dartein, an Alsatian architect who were involved in \nthe 19th restoration. In one drawing it is possible to see one of \nthe single-lancet windows before its enlargement (see fig. 81. \nIn: Bella 2013). Then, there is Landriani’s drawing (another \narchitect involved in the 19th-century restoration) of the \nnorthern side wall of the church, which represents the changes \nto be made at the single-lancet windows (see fig. 7. In: Capponi \n1987). The last one is a geometrical drawing with vertical and \nhorizontal sections of the first 3 spans of the arch structure (see \nfig. 6. In: Capponi 1987). \nThe author is unknown, but probably the drawing is related to \nthe 19th century-new-design project of the northern side of the \nchurch. These documents, together with the 2D geometrical \nsurvey realized for this research, were collected and added to \nthe HBIM in order to create a first database of pictures of the \narch structure. \nThe HBIM of the historical phases of the arch structure embeds \nall of this information in a 3D environment. It represents the 4 \nhistorical phases that were detected. The starting point is the \nbasilica after its Romanesque re-construction. At one point it \npresented pillars alternatively with rectangular (the bigger ones) \nor polygonal (the smallest ones) shapes (first phase). This is \nalso one of the reasons of the peculiar double-wave curve of the \nstructure. In fact, the need of joining together smaller and bigger \npillars could have resulted into a horizontal and vertical \ncurvature. The first reconstruction of this arrangement is made \nby De Dartein, who drew the plan of the basilica as it would \nhave appeared in the 12th century. His hypothesis was later \ncorroborated by Ferdinando Reggiori, the architect in charge of \nthe 20th-century restoration. He had the opportunity to measure \nand report in his drawings 2 of the former polygonal pillars. \nThese drawings, together with former geometrical survey data \nstored in the S. Ambrogio archive, were digitalized and attached \nto the HBIM in order to georeferenced the historical \ninformation (Fig. 9). \n \n \n \nFigure 9. Single-lancet windows construction history. \n \nIn the second phase, all the pillars had the rectangular shape, \nand later the arches were built in between them (third phase). In \nfact, it is possible to see that the arches of the structure cover the \nRomanesque little arches decoration of the walls. It is not \npossible to certainly state when these two phases were carried \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLII-2/W9, 2019 \n8th Intl.

In any case, it is quite sure that at one time the pillars were \nvisible – they were not hidden behind other constructions – \nbecause a mural painting was found on the pillar of the arch. 3 \non a lower level of the current first floor of the Canonica. \nIn a picture took by Reggiori it is possible to see 3 steps that \nwere found during the restoration of the church on the pillars \nbetween arch n. 5 and 6 (the picture can be found in the Basilica \ndi S. Ambrogio archive). Both the mural painting and the steps \nare witnesses of former arrangements of the northern side of the \nbasilica.  \nThe last phase (fourth phase) is the construction of the northern \nchapels and the Canonica by Donato Bramante (end of 15th \ncentury). Bramante decided to build the wall of the chapel 1 \nmeters away from the pillars. \nThe reason of the construction of this structure is still unknown, \nit is highly likely that it is a kind of buttresses system of the \nchurch.  \nIn fact, the church suffered of some structural problems during \nits life cycle as the out-of-plomb of the walls demonstrates (Fig. \n10). \nDuring this research three main hypothesis were made.The first \none relates the construction of the arch structure to the need of \nimproving the structural behaviour of the church after the \ncollapse of the first vault of the Nave around 1193-94 (Porter \n1917, Ambrosioni 2003). \nThe second one is related again to the vaults and considers the \narch structure as an additional support to the whole vaulted \nsystem, together with the matronei (Reggiori 1966). \nThe third one is related to the possibility that the arch structure \nhelps the structural behaviour of the church also in case of an \nearthquake: the pillars counteract the vaults thrust, while the \narches can better resist to the horizontal loads.  \n \n \n \nFigure 10. Out-of-plomb of the basilica walls. \n \n3.4 The development of layered web-interface based on \n360° panoramas for historical, material and geometric \nanalysis \nIn recent years different types of photographs visualization have \nemerged. In particular, 360°cameras gave the possibility to \ncreate virtual reality, immersive photography and Virtual Tour \n(Bonacini, 2015; Banfi et al., 2018). The acquisition of the \nspherical images was carried out by using the  RICOH THETA \nV. The camera acquires two images acquired with a fisheye lens \nthat are stitched together to generate a 460°image \n(equirectangular projection). The acquired images were used to \ntexture the HBIM model.  As described in the previous \nparagraph, HBIM generation required the integrated use of \nGOG9 and GOG10 in order to create a complex NURBS model \nable to follow the point clouds with a grade of accuracy of about \n1 mm. As a result, the SCAN-to-BIM model of the arch \nstructure allowed to map the model with the orthophoto threedimensionally.\nThe problem of how to represent the texture in \nNURBS surface has been overcome by means of uv mapping. U \nand V are the coordinates of the texture corresponding to X and \nY. A mapping channel holds a set of texture-mapping \nparameters. Each mapping channel was identified by a number. \nAn object can have any number of channels and therefore can \nhold any number of texture mapping types. Any time an image \nwas applied as a material to the model, uv texture mapping has \nbeen used. Textures in materials can be assigned a channel \nnumber. When the textures are applied to the object, the texture \nis attached by using the matching channel number of the object.  \nFigure 11 shows the method applied to the HBIM. It is \ncomposed of four step procedure: \n \n• The definition of each picture edge for each trimmed \nNURBS surface. \n \n• The definition of a U and V NURBS subdivisions and \ndirections for each NURBS surface. \n \n• The assignment of the 3D texture to each NURBS \nsurface. \n \n• The comparison of the mapped NURBS surface with \nthe point cloud in order to check the quality of the \n“matching” phase. \n \nOnce correctly mapped every single surface it has been possible \nto test different solutions for exporting the panoramas from the \nmodel. \nIn recent months, a great number of applications has been \ndeveloped by the leading software companies such as \nGraphisfot, Autodesk, and Real Engine and Unity. V-ray \napplication is one of the most used add-ins for Mc Neel \nRhinoceros that allows to maintain the direct control of \nNURBS. It is supported by the most used computer graphics \nsoftware, including Autodesk 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, Autodesk \nMaya, Softimage XSI, SketchUp, Blender, Nuke. Its most \nimportant feature is the ability to offer a very high time / quality \nratio due to its approximation algorithms (Biased method) and \nto export different type of outputs such as ultra detailed VR \nscenes. The integrated use of V-Ray with Mc Neel Rhinoceros \nallows the creation of different panoramas that support the \nreading of different 3D views, which show thematic analysis, \nsuch as the current arrangement of the arch structure and the \ndecay analysis. \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLII-2/W9, 2019 \n8th Intl.

It “cuts” the USM \n201 and is “filled” with USM 219, in fact the bricks of the USM \n219 are not aligned with the ones of the USM 201. \nAnother interesting “negative” unit is the USN 216 that \nrepresent the breach between the arches and the pillars, which \nmeans that the two elements belong to different construction \nphases. \nMany other stratigraphic units were recognized on each part of \nthe structure. \nIt is really curios that the intrados of each arch has many \n“negative” and “positive” units, which means that those part \nwere rehashed and restored several times. Each stratigraphic \nunit were record in specific datasheet. \n \n \n4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS \nDigital technologies are changing the approach to the Built \nHeritage, clearly showing the new paradigm of complexity. \nAs a consequence, architects, restorers and experts are facing \nnew challenges in their work. \nThe growing need of 3D representations led them to differently \napproach to the study of the Built Heritage, moving away from \nthe traditional 2D drawings and thinking about the 3 dimensions \nof the building. \nAt the same time their way of design restoration plans and \ninterventions is affected by these changes. \nUndoubtedly, the interdisciplinary cooperation between BIM \noperators and Cultural Heritage experts is a fruitful one because \nit allows to reach high level of analysis, but at the same time it \nis necessary to share the same “working” languages and \nvocabularies. \nOn the other hands, each expert has its own area of expertise, \nthat is why the cooperation has to be developed through jointapproaches\nthat allow experts to understand the different \ncontributions of the study.  \nThis paper offers some considerations about this discussion and \ncontributes to the focus on different ways to make BIM \ntechnologies available to experts (by making them able to do \ntheir specific analysis) and not-experts (tourist-oriented \npurposes) (Fig. 12). \n \n \n \nFigure 12.
