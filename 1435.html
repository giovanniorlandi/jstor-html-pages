The feature of the din\nner which attracted the most atten- ]\ntion and occasioned the most com- i\nment was the speech of Mr. Olney, t\nsetting forth Democratic principles, i\n.and naming Mr. Cleveland as the\ngreatest living exponent of these\nprinciples and the man wlio could\nmost successfully stand for thiem]\nas the Presidential candidate of his\nparty.\nIn the cloak rooms and corri(lors\nof the Capitol the Democrats have\ndiscussed delightfully the strictures\nof Mr olncy and of Mr. Hill upon\nthe doillinant party and President I\nRoosevelt. General coiicdrrence in\nthe views of the speaker upon the\nRepublicans and their leader was\nfound among Democrats. But when\nit came to Mr. Olney\'s suggestion\nof Mr. Cleveland a damper is\nthrown over the discussion.\nMr. Onley\'s remarks about Mr.\nCleveland are met with a wry face\namong the Southern and Western\nDemocrats. One effect of his speech\nwill be, it is said, to effectually\nshut off all consideration of Mr.\nOlney as a possible Presidential\ncandidate by the Suthe.rn and\nWestern Je,mocrntz. He will be\nticketed and classed with Mr. Cleve\nland more effectually than before,\n,,.althouglh his candidacy always has\nbeen tainted with Clevelandism, to\nuse the expression most frequently t\nheard among Southerners. Within\nthe past ten days an effort has been\nmade to start an Olney boom, but\nit is evident from the remarks made\nby prominent Democrats that neith\n-er the Olney nor the Cleveland\nboom is likely to get further South\nthan the Back bay.\nSenator Tillman, of South Caro\nlina, gave utterance to the orlinion\nwhich seems ge-erally to be shared\nby Democ" the Sonth and\nWiest.\n"\'Ca \' ?" said Senator\nTillhnman. "Th enlm c is n onsensicalI\nWith him as ourW canididate we\nwould lose every\' chance that we*\nno0w have to carry the Presidential\nelection.

I also admit that he would\nget some votes from Republicans.\nHe is so good a Repubicanm that\nlie would be preferred by many men\nin that party to Roosevelt. Bt\nbless you for every one of those\nvotes that he would bring us lie\nwould lose an untold number ofotur\nown Democrats.
