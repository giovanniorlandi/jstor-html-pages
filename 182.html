In \nthis comparative analysis, I examine the status of permanent and \nlong-term residents and relevant policy changes that enhance \ntheir social and political rights regardless of naturalization. \nPermanent residents in Japan can access social welfare benefits \nsuch as the national pension, public assistance, and child \nallowances, but they are excluded from local suffrage. In con\xad\ntrast, permanent residents of South Korea have political rights in \nlocal elections while welfare coverage for them is restricted to \npublic insurance, with no public aid entitlement. This difference \nrepresents a policy gap, caused by inconsistencies in the process \nof policy revisions and different priorities in policymaking. \nKeywords: resident foreigners, policy gap, immigrant incorpora\xad\ntion, comparative policy analysis, citizenship, social rights, politi\xad\ncal rights.\nMigration as a consequence of globalization presents both \nsending and receiving communities with multiple challenges and \nsocial transformations (Castles and Miller 2003). The ideas of \nmembership and citizenship, previously anchored exclusively in \nthe nation-state, have had to be revised in light of greatly increas\xad\ning human mobility across boundaries (Benhabib and Resnik \n2009; Castles and Davidson 2000; Joppke 2010; Purcell 2003). As \nmajor destination countries of migration flows in Asia, South \nKorea and Japan have introduced new policies to respond to the \ninflux of transnational migrants. While apparently maintaining \ntheir identities as nonimmigration countries, emerging issues\n699\n', '700 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\naround cultural diversity and ethnic minorities have increasingly \ninfluenced public concerns and policy agenda-setting in recent \ndecades.\nIn Japan, multicultural coexistence has been advocated, \nmainly since the 1990s, by civil organizations and local govern\xad\nments, which have organized public services for resident foreign\xad\ners (Aiden 2011; JMIC 2006; Nagy 2008; Shipper 2008). At least \nin terms of legal revision, the South Korean government has taken \nmore tangible steps, notably the Multicultural Families Support \nAct (2001). It established public service centers for marriage- \nmigrant women, and official five-year plans on policy toward for\xad\neigners have been implemented (Hwang 2014; Yoon 2010).\nHowever, Korean and Japanese immigration-related policy \narrangements have been described as basically exclusive rather \nthan inclusive. Both are regarded as examples of the “differential \nexclusion” model (Castles and Davidson 2000; Castles and Miller \n2003; Kim 2013; Yamanaka 2010). That model means “accepting \nimmigrants only within strict functional and temporal limits: they \nare welcome as workers, but not as settlers; as individuals, but not \nas families or communities; as temporary sojourners, but not as \nlong-term residents” (Castles and Davidson 2000, 61). Thus, \nmigrant settlement in South Korea and Japan has been scant com\xad\npared to other developed countries outside Asia (Seol and \nSkrentny 2009), with only a modest impact on modifying the \nlegal framework of citizenship (Asis and Batistella 2012).\nThe idea of differential exclusion or selective state response \nto diverse migrant groups provides a general framework to under\xad\nstand the peculiarities of migration regimes in East Asian coun\xad\ntries compared with other regions. There are, however, weak \npoints in this typology. Describing similarities of migration poli\xad\ncies among East Asian countries as all belonging to a differential \nexclusion model may intensify a stereotypical image of Asian cul\xad\nture and nationalist traditions without proper elaboration. Facing \nmany challenges like aging populations, shrinking labor \nresources, and emerging demand for global talents to enhance \ncompetitiveness of the national economy, Japan and South Korea \nmust deal with diverse internal demands to reformulate conven\xad\ntional immigration control policy.\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 701\nTo compare South Korea and Japan, I examine the social con\xad\nstruction of the policy agenda on foreign residents, especially per\xad\nmanent and long-term residents, and its implications for the \nrealignment of citizenship (Baubock and Guiraudon 2009). Unlike \nprevious studies that compared overall immigration policies or \nmulticultural models between South Korea and Japan (Chung \n2010b; Yamanaka 2010), I focus on the status of permanent resi\xad\ndents or de facto settlers and relevant policy changes that enhance \ntheir social and political rights regardless of naturalization. By \nobserving the state of rights and entitlements based not on nation\xad\nality but on mere residence, we can figure out the structures of \ninclusion provided for alien citizens and also examine the range \nof institutional flexibilities that may reflect shared ideas of \nnational membership and legitimacy of public policy in each host \nsociety.\nIn the following sections, I briefly examine theoretical dis\xad\ncussions on migration and citizenship realignment, policy gaps \namong complicated forms of migration incorporation, and the sta\xad\ntus of resident foreigners in migration policy literature. I then ana\xad\nlyze the increasing presence of foreign residents in South Korea \nand Japan and factors that are shaping public policies for perma\xad\nnent and long-term residents. I also briefly observe the historical \nprocesses of institutionalizing permanent residency. I compare \ninstitutional designs to include foreign residents in the citizenship \nscheme, and examine different policy gaps with regard to the \nsocial and political rights of resident foreigners in the two coun\xad\ntries. In conclusion, I investigate the further implications of this \ncomparative analysis to extend ideas on migration and realign\xad\nment of citizenship.\nMembership of Resident Foreigners and the Policy Gap\nMany scholars pay attention to general typologies of immigrant \nincorporation regimes, which seem to generate the criteria for \ndiverging or converging tendencies of host societies to embrace or \nexclude immigrants. This approach is problematic, however, since \nthese categories lack internal congruity and oversimplify diver-\n', '702 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\ngent tendencies in expanding policy areas related to immigration \n(Freeman 2001). The focus of my research is not on categorizing \nnational policy patterns but on observing policy gaps in public \ninstitutions aimed at supporting permanent or long-term resident \nforeigners.\nHammer (1989) highlighted the term denizen to describe the \nstatus of foreigners who possess substantial rights and privileges \nas long-term residents in Europe. Soysal (1994) argued that guest \nworkers in several European countries in the postwar era eventu\xad\nally settled down, even without formal citizenship status. Foreign \nlaborers and their children were incorporated into the legal and \nwelfare systems, although the pattern of incorporation differed \ndepending on “predominant models and organizing principles of \nmembership” in each country (Soysal 1994, 79). She also sug\xad\ngested a new form of “postnational membership” based not on \nindividual nationality but on universal personhood—a deterritori- \nalized form of membership, consistent with the international \nhuman rights regime established by various United Nations \ncovenants.\nThe idea of postnational membership has been seriously crit\xad\nicized. Joppke (1999) pointed out that empirical evidence is lack\xad\ning to clarify whether postnational membership really represents \nan epochal shift from classical national membership. The concept \nunderestimates the resilience of nation-states in a globalizing \nworld, Joppke wrote. Far from escaping the grasp of the state, \nmigration is subject to sophisticated technologies of regulation \nand executive control (Brubaker 2010). Nation-states ratify and \nimplement human rights conventions in their territories \n(Aleinikoff 1999; Varsanyi 2006). For example, crucial protec\xad\ntions of guest workers from deportation, residence and family \nreunion rights for immigrants, and antidiscrimination measures \nfor ethnic minorities have all primarily derived from domestic \ncourts based on the constitutional law that subjects sovereign state \npowers to universal human rights principles (Joppke 1999).\nDespite these criticisms, Soysal’s argument deserves to be \nrevisited, especially as an elaborated frame for cross-national \nresearch. Unlike previous studies that extrapolate the demand for \nimmigration control or assimilation policies from attributes of \nimmigrants, such as cultural differences and lack of human capi-\n', "Jung-Mee Hwang 703\ntai, Soysal highlights the impact of established policy patterns in \nhost societies. “When states encounter the incorporation of post\xad\nwar migrants as a new issue area, they draw upon existing institu\xad\ntional repertoires and resources, that is, their predominant models \nand organizing principles of membership’ '’ (Soysal 1994, 79; \nemphasis added).\nPrinciples of membership in a host society include various \ndimensions, including cultural values and identities, economic \nopportunity structures, political representation systems, and legal \ncriteria of qualifications. My research concentrates on two ques\xad\ntions: In which processes have permanent and long-term residents \nbeen accepted and qualified, at least partly, as members of host \ncommunities in South Korea and Japan? How is membership based \non residence presented in legal institutions and public policy?\nImmigration policymaking forms a multilayered and compli\xad\ncated process generating incongruence or gaps between projected \npurposes and unexpected outcomes. The notion of policy gap has \nbeen discussed in different ways by many authors—for example, \nas a gap between restrictive goals and expansive outcomes, as a \ndiscrepancy between public anti-immigration sentiments and the \nmore liberal attitudes of decisionmaking elites, or as a contradic\xad\ntion stemming from interest conflicts and hidden agendas (Castles \n2007; Lahav and Guiraudon 2007; Statham and Geddes 2007).\nThe same is true for the landscape of policymaking in South \nKorea and Japan. In Japan, the contradictions between policies \nthat exclude foreigners and discourage immigrants on the one \nhand, and practices devised to integrate foreign residents in mul\xad\nticultural coexistence schemes on the other, have engendered \ndilemmas for authorities (Chung 2010a). Lack of congruity, for \ninstance between rampant mercantilist policies toward foreign \nlabor and rather paternalistic public provisions for immigrant \nspouses, have been widely disputed among scholars examining \nSouth Korea (Kim 2013; Oh 2009).\nWhereas each country maintains the jus sanguinis principle of \ncitizenship as befits its identity as a nonimmigration country, the \nboundary of membership has undeniably been both blurred and \nreconstituted in terms of managing immigration issues. Foreign \nlabor has been in great demand to compensate for a rapidly aging \npopulation, organized appeals from civil society and nongovem-\n", '704 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\nmental organizations (NGOs) have increased to protect the human \nrights of migrants, and recognition of cultural diversity values has \nexpanded. In keeping with these multiple social needs, the range \nof policy intervention has been extended to various areas such as \nincorporation programs, welfare benefits, and even political par\xad\nticipation of foreign residents in decisionmaking processes.\nIn the discussion that follows, I explore similarities and dif\xad\nferences in recent policy changes and policy gaps in two cases, \ncomparing the institutional settings of social and political rights \nof resident foreigners in South Korea and Japan since the 1990s. \nBefore turning to the main arguments on the status of resident for\xad\neigners, recent immigration and naturalization trends there need to \nbe briefly sketched.\nCharacteristics of the Foreign Resident Populations\nin South Korea and Japan\nSouth Korea and Japan are characterized by an unusual, even \nexceptional, ethnic homogeneity of population compared with \nother developed countries. Foreign-bom residents constituted less \nthan 2 percent of the total residents in South Korea and Japan in \n2011, far below the average (7.8 percent) of Organization for Eco\xad\nnomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries \n(OECD 2012). South Korea and Japan belong to the lowest group \nin terms of the ratio of acquisition of citizenship among OECD \ncountries. Given the unchallenged orthodoxy of jus sanguinis in \nboth countries, a relatively low rate of naturalization is to be \nexpected. According to the OECD database, newly naturalized cit\xad\nizens between 2000 and 2010 are only 1.3 persons per thousand \ncitizens in Japan and 2.6 persons in South Korea, much lower \nthan the OECD average of 24.6 persons during the same period. \nIn both countries, family reunion rights for low-skilled laborers \nand citizenship endowments for second-generation immigrants are \nstrictly controlled, so the natural increase of the foreign popula\xad\ntion is limited except for certain groups of kin-foreigners and old- \ncomers (see Table 1).\nIn spite of overall tendencies to control immigration influx, \nthe number of actual long-term foreign residents has increased\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 705\nconsistently since the 1980s in both countries. Official statistics \npublished in 2011 state that more than 2 million foreigners reside \nin Japan, an increase of almost 2.6 times in thirty years.1 In South \nKorea, the number of registered foreigners grew by a factor of \napproximately fifteen in the last twenty years. This is why Tsuda \ndescribed South Korea and Japan as “countries of recent immi\xad\ngration” (Tsuda 2006, 4-6).\nThe composition of foreigners varies significantly, for almost \nhalf of those registered in South Korea are low-skilled guest \nworkers while in Japan almost half are permanent residents. Per\xad\nmanent residents (PRs) living in Japan (49.5 percent) comprise \ntwo subgroups: those who obtained special PR visas as descen\xad\ndants of Koreans who had arrived in the early twentieth century, \nand newcomers who mostly entered since the 1980s and received \ngeneral PR visas. “Long-term residents” (8.1 percent) are also \nallowed relatively stable residence and employment opportunities, \nso Kondo (2001, 14) described their status as “quasi-permanent \nresidency.” Most of them are Nikkeijin, descendants of Japanese \nemigrants who had left for South America (see Table 3). Unlike \nJapan, PR visa holders in South Korea comprise only 10.2 percent \nof registered foreigners, while low-skilled labor is the largest sin\xad\ngle group (48.4 percent).

The \nlow-skilled are mainly from underdeveloped Asian countries, \nwhereas the PR group is mostly Korean diaspora descendants who \nhave lived in China and formerly Soviet-dominated countries for \nover two generations (see Table 2).\nThe population of permanent residents is significantly larger \nin Japan than in South Korea, which may be related to the policy \ndivergence in incorporating foreign residents as members of the\n', '708 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\nhost society. Interconnected features of annual naturalization and \ncumulative permanent residents portray different trajectories in \nthe two cases (see Figure 2). In Japan, foreigners who reside in \nJapan with stable PR visas have consistently increased during the \nlast fifteen years, while issuance of PR visas, officially estab\xad\nlished only since 2002, has generally stagnated during the same \nperiod in South Korea. Looking at annual naturalization trends, \nnewly naturalized citizens in South Korea have increased tremen\xad\ndously between 2001 and 2009, while the annual rate of natural\xad\nization has gradually diminished in Japan. Weaving these con\xad\ntrasting trends together, it is plausible to argue that long-term \nimmigrants in Japan have been incorporated mainly and consis\xad\ntently as permanent residents without naturalization. Unlike \nJapan, the dominant channel of incorporation accessible to foreign \nresidents in South Korea seems to be naturalization and assimila\xad\ntion to mainstream society.\nOn the other hand, we should note that these divergent trends \nhave clearly been changing since 2009 when the curve of perma\xad\nnent residents in South Korea started to ascend and, simultane\xad\nously, refusals of naturalization applications considerably \nincreased.2 Several experts argue the need to realign permanent \nresidency status so as to make it a preliminary procedure for nat\xad\nuralization, noting that a short-term surge of naturalization \ninduced administrative overburden and might also have generated \nnational identity trouble (Choe 2010). Considering these ongoing \ndisputes on policy moderations in South Korea, the increasing \ntrend toward naturalization is expected to be regulated while per\xad\nmanent residency continues to increase.\nFormation of Permanent Residency and Implications for \nResidential Rights\nThe Long Road to Gaining Residency\nAt the end of World War II, there were 600,000 foreigners in \nJapan, mostly former colonial subjects from Korea.

Their number \nrapidly increased from 1930 on, as they were massively con\xad\nscripted for the Japanese war regime. Entitlements of Korean res\xad\nidents in Japan were seriously undercut when the Allied occupa\xad\ntion of Japan ended. These Koreans were suddenly categorized as \nlegal aliens on the principle of jus sanguinis under the Nationality \nLaw and excluded from state welfare systems (Kang and Kim \n1989; Tai 2009b). Only after several decades were long-resident \nKoreans endowed with stable residency (“treaty” permanent resi\xad\ndency) based on the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between \nJapan and the Republic of Korea. However, only resident Koreans \nwho acquired the nationality of South Korea obtained that special \nstatus; Koreans who maintained the old Chosun registration and\n', '710\nFigure 3 Trends of Permanent Residents and Long-Term Residents, \nJapan, 2001-2013\n■PR aspecial PR (Korea/Chosun) n Long-term residents\nSource: Ministry of Justice, Japan, Annual Report, Immigration Statistics, www \n.e-stat.go.jp.\nFigure 4 Trends of Permanent Residents and Kin Foreigners, Korea, 2002-2013\n■PR (others) a PR (Taiwan) aF4\nSource: Korea: KIS (Korea Immigration Service), Ministry of Justice, KIS Statistics, \nannually, www.immigration.go.kr.\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 711\nwho had had North Korean citizenship were excluded (Han 2010). \nIn 1981, the eligibility for permanent residency was extended to \nall Koreans by creating “special” permanent residency. Third-gen\xad\neration descendants of Koreans became eligible under a 1991 \nbilateral agreement between the two governments (Kang and Kim \n1989; Han 2010).\nAround the 1990s, the offspring of Japanese nationals who \nhad emigrated to Latin America (Nikkeijin) increasingly returned \nto Japan as industrial workers. The 1990 revision of the Immigra\xad\ntion Control and Refugee Recognition Law included new cate\xad\ngories of “long-term residents,” which could be regarded as pro\xad\nviding quasi-permanent residency (Kondo 2001). Nikkeijin thus \nachieved stable employment status in Japan. In the mid-1990s, \nwhen newcomers exceeded old-time foreigners, government poli\xad\ncies, which had been exclusively focused on immigration control, \nwere realigned to include incorporation of and coexistence with \nforeign residents. The naturalization process was loosened to pro\xad\nmote assimilation of Zainichi Koreans, thereby reducing the num\xad\nber of postcolonial foreigners to half a million at the end of the \n1990s (Tai 2009a).\nDuring the same period, skilled job opportunities for doctors, \nprofessors, and nurses became more open to foreigners (Kondo \n2001), some of whom took advantage of stable employment in \nJapan to settle down as permanent residents. As newcomer resi\xad\ndents consistently increased, special permanent residents, mostly \nZainichi Koreans, shrank to only 36.3 percent (373,221 persons) \namong the PR visa holders in 2013.\nThe Right of Residency\nUnlike Japan, where permanent residency of foreigners has been \nmanaged for over half a century, South Korea established this visa \ncategory recently, in 2002. It was first designed to facilitate visa \nrenewal processes for ethnic Chinese residents (Hwagyo), descen\xad\ndants of Chinese who had settled in South Korea. Chinese mer\xad\nchants moving into Korea (Chosun) for trade at the end of the \nnineteenth century increased to approximately 80,000 in 1942, \nalthough they decreased subsequently due to the repressive poli-\n', '712 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\ncies of the Japanese colonial government and the outbreak of the \nChinese-Japanese War. After World War II, the Republic of Korea \nwas established in 1948 and set regulations on the entry of for\xad\neigners, virtually banning border crossing and any additional \ninflux of Chinese into South Korea. Cold War tensions and suspi\xad\ncion over Chinese economic power led to repressive measures \ntoward Hwagyo residents. Chinese residents in South Korea were \nprohibited from home visits and trade with mainland China once \nthe communist regime was set up there in 1949. Due to restric\xad\ntions on Hwagyo land ownership throughout the decades of eco\xad\nnomic development, their population, almost 30,000 in the early \n1970s, shrank and some were assimilated into South Korean soci\xad\nety (Park 2008).3\nNowadays Hwagyo are a minority among permanent resi\xad\ndency holders, about half being ethnic Korean Chinese (Chosun- \njok).4 Since diplomatic relations were established between South \nKorea and the People’s Republic of China in 1992, ethnic Korean \nChinese who are descendants of the Korean diaspora have \nincreasingly moved to South Korea, first as marriage migrants but \nlater as an alternative labor force that is now indispensable, espe\xad\ncially in the construction and small services sectors.5 Kin foreign\xad\ners, including Korean Chinese, can apply for the F-4 visa, which \nprovides ethnic Koreans from abroad with virtually unlimited job \nopportunities and a stepping-stone toward stable settlement. As \nseen in Figure 4, this group is growing as quasi-permanent resi\xad\ndents, surpassing the size of PR visa holders very rapidly. After \nonly a decade, permanent residency in South Korea has experi\xad\nenced dynamic change, not only in quantitative growth but also in \nits internal composition.\nComparing the formation of permanent residency in the two \ncountries, most significant is that Japan has dealt with many post\xad\ncolonial residents while South Korea has no parallel experience. \nUnlike Japan, social concerns about permanent residency have \nonly recently emerged and do not seem to be of significance in \nSouth Korean immigration policies. Despite quantitative differ\xad\nences, we can find similar trajectories in the institutional forma\xad\ntion of permanent residency. The permanent residency category \nwas initially introduced as a posteriori recognition for long-term\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 713\nresidence status for specific groups—Zainich in Japan and \nHwagyo in South Korea—who were residents from before the war \nand then became de facto settlers for more than three generations. \nMoreover, quasi-permanent residency status is devised to incor\xad\nporate kin foreigners—Nikkeijin in Japan and Chosunjok in South \nKorea—and this makes them eligible for relatively open employ\xad\nment opportunities.\nTherefore, I raise the question whether permanent residency \nin the two countries remains a group-specific right providing sta\xad\nble residence for designated ethnic groups, or forms a set of rights \nor membership based on mere residence. We can assume two fac\xad\ntors that can catalyze institutional extension of permanent resi\xad\ndency from a simple residence permit to a platform of member\xad\nship or citizenship shared by all residents of a community \nregardless of nationality. The first is organized movements from \nbelow demanding human rights and equal treatment for foreign \nresidents. Zainich Koreans in Japan have been very active in these \nmovements. The second factor is a state initiative from above to \npromote social incorporation and integration of foreign residents \ninto mainstream society. As mentioned, both governments intro\xad\nduced policy revisions with more positive approaches toward \ninclusion of foreign residents. In the following, I use the concep\xad\ntual frame of citizenship and membership to interpret theoretical \nimplications of these policy revisions and also to identify differ\xad\nences and similarities between the institutional schemes of the \ntwo countries.\nEntitlements of Resident Foreigners:\nSocial and Political Rights\nThe term resident foreigner has consistently and more frequently \nappeared in public reports and policy literature in both countries \n(Hwang 2014; JMIC 2006; Lee E. 2010). Since many previous \nstudies focused on local practice and specific context based on \ncase studies, more generalized explanations and theoretical \napproaches are needed (Korekawa 2008; Kweon 2010). My study \nuses a heuristic approach to produce an integrated perspective on\n', '714 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\ninstitutional arrangements. For such a theoretical elaboration, \nsocial and political rights as essential components of citizenship \nsuggested by T. H. Marshall (Marshall and Bottomore 1992) pro\xad\nvide appropriate conceptual tools.6 Marshall’s research examines \noverall forms of the legal and administrative system to deal with \nresident foreigners’ rights and entitlements rather than tracing \nactual outcomes of related policies.\nSocial Rights\nNarrowly, social rights mean legal access to welfare benefits but \nextend to the rights of full social inclusion (Marshall and Botto\xad\nmore 1992). The politics of social inclusion is differently struc\xad\ntured according to current ideas of who deserves to be protected. \nThe three main principles of entitlement discussed in welfare lit\xad\nerature are need, work, and citizenship/residence, and these rest \non different notions of deservingness (Sainsbury 2012). As Sains- \nbury points out, social benefits are not covered by a single prin\xad\nciple. Usually, policymakers coordinate these principles so as to \nform a specific mix.\nIn Japan, the nationality clause in basic laws regulating social \nwelfare provision has been eliminated with ratification of the \ninternational covenants on human rights (1979) and the Refugees \nConvention (1981). Policy revisions promoted not only migrants’ \nhuman rights but also social rights equality between nationals and \nnonnationals (Kondo 2001). Work as a basis of entitlement seems \nto operate well with foreign residents legally employed in Japan. \nSocial insurance includes foreign workers on the same basis as \ncitizen workers. Managed by contributions of all employed sub\xad\nscribers, these forms of social insurance need not impose nation\xad\nality as a condition.\nHowever, the historical process to include foreign residents in \nthese provisions has not been smooth and automatic either. Social \nmovements to improve Zainich Koreans’ social status have been \ninterconnected with international human rights regimes since the \n1970s. Once the importance of human rights for promoting minor\xad\nity rights was recognized, many Zainich Koreans, with the coop\xad\neration of civil society organizations, vigorously organized social\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 715\nmovements urging Japanese governments to ratify international \nhuman rights covenants. Even after ratification, however, many \nKoreans believed they were still discriminated against in welfare \nprovision because of job segregation that hindered access to ben\xad\neficial parts of national pension schemes. Moreover, the reciproc\xad\nity agreement between the Korean and Japanese governments dis\xad\nqualified Zainich Koreans who maintained Korean nationality \nfrom pension benefits provided by Japanese governments. This \nkind of actual exclusion of Zainich Koreans from Japanese \nnational pensions was resolved when the International Refugee \nConvention was ratified and refugees were included in Japanese \nnational pensions regardless of nationality (Kang and Kim 1989, \n207-238).\nEntitlement based on need is fulfilled with public assistance \nsystems that form safety nets against poverty and provide benefits \nto persons with insufficient resources. Interestingly, public assis\xad\ntance for foreigners in Japan has contracted, not increased. The \nLivelihood Protection Law (1950), although not including non\xad\nnationals as beneficiaries, applied mutatis mutandis to provide \nsubstantial benefits and medical care for all registered foreigners. \nIn accordance with 1990 visa system revisions, the Ministry of \nHealth and Welfare applied livelihood protection coverage only to \npermanent residency holders, their spouses and children, and \n“long-term residents” (Kondo 2001; Yim and Seol 2006). Perma\xad\nnent and long-term residents can be provided with the public ben\xad\nefits of livelihood protection systems if they are recognized by \ngovernment as being in urgent need. But that means these foreign \nresidents are not equal to Japanese nationals in their entitlements.\nThird, residence can be a basis for entitlements if benefits \naccorded to citizens extend to immigrants meeting certain resi\xad\ndence requirements. In Japan, foreigners who reside more than a \nyear in a locality are eligible for local old-age insurance and \nhealth care. Welfare allowances for child care also include foreign \nparents resident in Japan. In addition, several local governments \nprovide public services for foreign residents’ living conveniences \nsuch as public rental housing and guaranteed insurance for foreign \ntenants. Other localities are also concerned with unpaid medical \nbills resulting from a lack of health insurance coverage for immi-\n', '716 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\ngrants; they provide access to emergency medical care in cooper\xad\nation with civil advocacy groups (Milly 2006; Shipper 2008).\nIn South Korea, social security primarily means national wel\xad\nfare for citizens according to the Framework Act on Social Secu\xad\nrity. The nationality clause remains, but the social security system \ncan be applied to foreigners residing in South Korea where the \napplication accords with the principle of reciprocity or related \nlaws and statues. Social rights of foreign residents in South Korea \ncan be comparatively analyzed in terms of the same three bases \nfor entitlement I used for Japan.\nLike Japan, legal foreign workers are accorded work-based \nrights almost equal to those of citizen workers. In 2015, the \nNational Pension Act was revised so that foreign nationals \nemployed at a workplace covered by the national pension law \nor residing in South Korea are insured. Major public insurance \nacts cover not only permanent residents but also other con\xad\ntributing foreigners (Ku et al. 2009; Seol 2013). As in Japan, \nwork-based entitlement extends to foreign residents in South \nKorea without nationality requirements. Unskilled foreign \nworkers who have a legal employment permit (E-9 visa) are \nalso covered by Employment Insurance and Industrial Accident \nCompensation Insurance.7\nIn terms of needs-based entitlement, the nationality principle \nis strictly maintained in South Korea’s public assistance system. \nBoth foreign workers and permanent residents are excluded from \npublic aid systems and the basic senior pension (Ku et al. 2009; \nSeol 2013). Interestingly, special exceptions exist to provide min\xad\nimum livelihood only for foreign spouses who meet several \nrequirements—if they are pregnant, raising a minor of Korean \nnationality, or sharing a livelihood or dwelling with their spouses’ \nlineal ascendants who have Korean nationality. This implies that \nforeign spouses’ right to receive social provisions is dependent on \nthe needs of kin Korean nationals, making it more of a derivative \nright for dependent family members rather than an independent \nentitlement based on a foreign resident’s needs or on universal \nhuman rights.\nEntitlement based on residence has rarely been discussed in \nSouth Korea. As permanent residency was established only\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 717\nrecently, it is usually considered as qualification for mere resi\xad\ndence rather than a membership right proximate to citizenship. \nCompared to Japan, substantial social services for foreign resi\xad\ndents provided by local governments in South Korea have not \nbeen widely developed (Han 2004; Hwang 2014). Public welfare \nservices such as child care are only accorded to marriage migrants \nwho are expected to be naturalized, excluding other permanent \nresidents (Ku et al. 2009; Seol 2013). There are specific service \ncenters for marriage-migrants and multicultural families (mixed \nforeigner-Korean marriages). In a way, South Korea’s Ministry of \nGender Equality and Family did extend its scheme of gender pol\xad\nicy to migrant women by providing emergency call services and \ntemporary shelter for sexual and domestic violence victims; but \npublic services are mostly concentrated on counseling and educa\xad\ntion programs for foreign spouses’ adaptation in family relations. \nIn general, entitlement based on residence has not been seriously \nand sufficiently considered in the process of policy building for \nforeigners in South Korea (see Table 4).\nTo compare the social rights of resident foreigners in the two \ncountries with reference to the idea of three bases of entitlement, \nboth similarities and differences can be identified. In both coun\xad\ntries, social rights based on employment almost equal to those of \ncitizens have been extended to foreign residents. Legally \nemployed foreigners are included in social insurance in South \nKorea and Japan. However, with no legal employment or very \nvulnerable job status, foreign residents are usually excluded from \nsocial security. Public assistance to ensure a minimum level of \nlivelihood is available to permanent residents and long-term resi\xad\ndents in Japan, though not guaranteed as a legal entitlement for \nforeign residents. Such assistance is more restricted in South \nKorea; virtually no foreigners are protected by public aid except \nforeign spouses who care for dependent family members of \nKorean nationality. Similarly, entitlement based on residence \napplies only to foreign spouses rearing children who have Korean \nnationality. Therefore, differences between the two cases are \nobserved in the entitlement based on need and also entitlement \nbased on residence. Foreign residents domiciled in Japan have \nwider access to local welfare provisions.\n', '718 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\nTable 4 Three Entitlements of Social Rights of Foreign Residents, \nSouth Korea and Japan\nJapan South Korea\nEntitlement based on work \n(social insurance)\nLegally employed foreigners National pension National pension\nHealth-care insurance Health-care insurance\nEmployment insurance Employment insurance\nAll foreign employees Industrial accident Industrial accident\ncompensation insurance compensation insurance\nEntitlement based on need \n(public assistance)\nPermanent residents, their \nspouses and children, and \nlong-term residents No entitlement, but\nNo public assistance\nsubstantial application \nfor specific visa holders\nForeign nationals, special\nEntitlement based on residence \nForeigners who have \nresidence in Japan Welfare allowance\nexception for foreign \nspouses who are raising a \nminor having Korean \nnationality, or sharing \nlivelihood or dwelling \nwith his/her spouse’s \nlineal ascendant having \nKorean nationality\nChildren of foreign spouses \nmarried to Korean nationals\n(child benefits, child-care \nallowance)\nLocal insurance for old age \nand health-care provision\nChild-care service\nMany authors emphasize that ratification of international con\xad\nventions is a trigger to broaden welfare coverage for resident for\xad\neigners in Japan (Kang and Kim 1989; Kondo 2001). In accor\xad\ndance with international human rights regimes, the Japanese \ngovernment gradually eliminated nationality clauses in basic laws \nregulating social welfare provision. In particular, the Refugee \nConvention was a turning point in revising policy frames on \nsocial rights and encompassing a broad range of foreign residents \nwho have stable residence in Japan, both old-comers and those \nmore recently arrived. However, permanent residents, let alone\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 719\nother foreigners, are barred from minimum public aid in South \nKorea even though the Refugee Convention was ratified in 1993 \nand a national law managing refugees was put into effect in 2014. \nTherefore, I argue that the effect of international human rights \nregimes over nation-states to extend the social rights of foreign \nresidents often depends on the preexisting contexts of policy deci\xad\nsions and the social legacies of each national government.\nPolitical Rights\nPolitical participation is a quintessential part of citizenship and \nmembership in contemporary representative democracy. In the \nconstitutional doctrine that sovereignty rests with the people, peo\xad\nple in most countries means legal citizens. However, looking at \nthe specific experiences of Western democratic countries in form\xad\ning and revising nonnationals’ citizenship entitlement, we can find \ndiverse institutional coordination to permit certain ranges of polit\xad\nical participation for resident foreigners. In Britain, for example, \ncitizens from Commonwealth countries and several privileged \ncountries such as Ireland enjoy all political, civic, and social priv\xad\nileges if they are residents in Britain. Aliens who are European \nUnion nationals can vote in local and European elections but not \nin parliamentary elections (Layton-Henry 2001)—at least up until \nthe Brexit vote in July 2016. According to Swedish electoral law, \nmost aliens may vote in local elections if they register as residents \nfor three consecutive years. But aliens may not vote in national \nelections (Dingu-Kyrklund 2001). Aliens of any class in the \nUnited States, unlike citizens, are not entitled to vote in state or \nfederal elections, though several localities have recently made \npermanent residents eligible to vote in local elections (Heller \n2001).\nThere are multiple channels for political participation, and cit\xad\nizens may vote in elections, campaign for a political party, stand \nfor elected public office, and take part in everyday activities of \ngrassroots-level democracy as well. If we compare the political \nrights of permanent residents in terms of enfranchisement, we see \na clear contrast: some permanent residents can vote in local elec\xad\ntions in South Korea, while those in Japan cannot. In 2005, the\n', '720 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\nSouth Korean national assembly revised the election law to give \nlocal enfranchisement to resident foreigners who have stayed in \nSouth Korea for over three years after acquiring permanent resi\xad\ndency, although they cannot vote in national elections. For a more \nnuanced comparison between South Korea and Japan, three points \nneed to be investigated further.\nFirst, a philosophical issue emerges: whether the politico- \nadministrative state unit—often imagined as a national body—is \nindivisible. France, for instance, considers that the constitutional \nprinciples of national sovereignty are opposed to any division by \ncategory of voting or eligible citizens, for any political suffrage \nand in particular for prefectural or town elections. Not until the \nMaastricht Treaty on European integration were foreigners \nallowed to vote in French local elections (Guiguet 2001). The \ndoctrine of the indivisibility of the national body is at the core of \ndisputes on the enfranchisement of resident foreigners in Japan. \nPermanent residents and Zainich Koreans have organized protests, \nlobbies, and petitions for political suffrage since the 1980s, argu\xad\ning that aliens are eligible for political rights as residents sharing \nlivelihoods with neighbor citizens and being affected by decisions \nof local governments in their everyday lives regardless of nation\xad\nality. Energized by support from local nonprofit organizations and \n1,200 local governments, which submitted a resolution to grant \nlocal voting rights to foreign residents, several leading politicians \nintroduced a bill to the Diet (the national assembly of Japan) in \n1999 for enfranchisement (Chung 2010a; Hwang 2014). However, \nthe bill has made no progress to date.\nA 1995 Supreme Court decision in Japan on this matter \nretains ambivalent but critical elements. It prescribes that local \nsuffrage for resident foreigners is not opposed to the constitution \nin principle but only subject to the policy decision of the state \nadministration. The Supreme Court seemed to side with alien res\xad\nidents and Zainich Koreans as it pronounced on the legal validity \nof the local suffrage movement. However, it was unclear whether \nthe state has legal obligations to provide local voting rights to res\xad\nident foreigners (Choi 2004). This ambivalence may ironically \nprovide room for a “decision of un-decision” or “non-policy as a\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 721\npolicy,” which effectively detours sensitive issues on the rights of \nimmigrants (Van der Leun 2007, 111). The dominant Liberal \nDemocratic Party consistently keeps a distance from local suf\xad\nfrage issues, arguing that local polity is not an independent but \nrather a subordinate part of the national political community, so \nthe rights of local residents are indivisible from the rights of \nnationals (Yoo and Oh 2012). While the doctrine of indivisibility \nmay have lost its legal protection, it continues to be supported by \nthe general conception of ethnic nationalism in Japan (Kalicki \n2008).\nSecond, the context of South Korea’s being the first Asian \ncountry to introduce local enfranchisement for alien residents \nneeds to be scrutinized. South Korean president Kim Dae-jung \nraised the issue when he met Japanese prime minister Obuchi \nKeizo in 1999 and proposed a bilateral agreement for the local \nsuffrage of non-naturalized residents (Chung 2010a; Yoo and Oh \n2012). Although reform was delayed in Japan, the revised election \nlaw passed the South Korean parliament in 2005. This process \nshowed that political initiatives to provide political entitlements \nfor foreign residents were driven not only to enhance the human \nrights of immigrants in South Korea but also to promote the polit\xad\nical rights of overseas Koreans—especially Zainichi—residing in \nforeign countries.\nThe issue of indivisibility that dominated the local suffrage \ncontroversies in Japan was of almost no concern in South Korea. \nInstead, parallel to the voting rights of resident foreigners in \nSouth Korea, the granting of local suffrage to overseas Koreans \nhas been highlighted, exemplified by the 2013 National Assembly \nresolution on this matter (Hwang 2014). Unlike Japan, where the \nvoting rights of permanent residents generate sensitive “client \npolitics” (Freeman 2001, 65-67) and political disputes due to the \nmassive presence of older residents and organized protests, politi\xad\ncians in South Korea see this policy as “symbolic” (Van der Leun \n2007, 111). There, local alien voting is not expected to have a \nserious impact on established privileges.8 By emphasizing human \nrights advocacy against a backdrop of successful democratization, \nand also expressing sympathy for expatriate Koreans, local suf-\n', '722 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\nfrage of permanent residents can be achieved without organized \nopposition from native citizens.\nA third issue concerns diverse channels of political partici\xad\npation and the range and quality of political rights open to res\xad\nident foreigners in South Korea and Japan (see Table 5). For\xad\neigners in South Korea are enfranchised three years after \nacquiring permanent residency. But they cannot run for local \noffice, participate in election campaigns, or represent political \nparties. In Japan, even though electoral rights are prohibited for \nresident aliens, the government does not restrict the political \nfreedom of resident foreigners to join electoral campaigning or \neven found a political party, as seen in the case of Zainich-to \n(the Foreign Residents’ Voting Rights Party) (Kondo 2001). \nRemarkably, advisory councils and assemblies for foreign resi\xad\ndents have been organized in several Japanese localities (Chung \n2010a; Han 2004). Foreigners are also quite active in grassroots \npolitical activities—for example, building immigrant mothers’ \nnetworks in Hamamatsu City (Yamanaka 2010) or organizing a \nlocal council of native and alien residents living in public hous\xad\ning in Iwata City (Watado 2010). Advisory councils and grass\xad\nroots organizations composed of foreign residents have prolif\xad\nerated in Japan and provide diverse channels to participate in \nlocal decisionmaking through public deliberation. But in South \nKorea, although formal electoral reform has granted local suf\xad\nfrage to resident foreigners, grassroots participation is underde\xad\nveloped or only in preliminary stages in several localities.\nTable 5 Political Rights of Foreign Residents in South Korea and Japan, 2015\nJapan South Korea\nVoting rights in national elections No No\nVoting rights in local elections No Yes (2005)\nEligibility to be a candidate in\nlocal elections No No\nParticipation in election campaigns\nand related activities of political parties Yes No\nVoting in the inhabitants’ poll in locality Yes Yes\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 723\nConclusion\nI offer an alternative to a simple recourse to the differential exclu\xad\nsion model, which tends to underscore similarities between the \nimmigration regimes in South Korea and Japan. I present a closer \ncomparative examination of recent policy revisions for the incor\xad\nporation of foreign residents, focusing on whether foreign resi\xad\ndents are included in rights and entitlements to social welfare and \npolitical participation regardless of naturalization. South Korea \nand Japan have some commonalities as nonimmigration countries, \nbut they also have significant differences that previous studies \nhave not adequately highlighted.\nThe historical formation of permanent residency status was \nintroduced as a posteriori recognition of particular ethnic minori\xad\nties’ residential rights—Zainich in Japan and Hwagyo in South \nKorea. The term permanent resident population has been \nextended to include diverse newcomers in Japan and Korean Chi\xad\nnese who returned to their ancestors’ motherland in South Korea. \nAs the foreign population increases irreversibly, it is crucial to ask \nwhether long-term residents who settled down without naturaliza\xad\ntion are eligible for rights and entitlements to citizenship in these \ntwo countries. I find that permanent residents in Japan have \naccess to most social welfare benefits, such as national pensions, \npublic assistance, and child allowances, but are excluded from \nlocal suffrage. Permanent residents of South Korea, however, \nhave political rights in local elections while welfare coverage is \nrestricted to public insurance.\nI argue that this difference between South Korea and Japan \ncan be explained in terms of a policy gap generated by inconsis\xad\ntencies and discrepancies in the process of developing diverse \npolicy revisions in each country. Policy areas for incorporating \nforeign residents have been expanded in South Korea and Japan in \nresponse to the decoupling of residency and citizenship, and to \nmediate mismatches of ethnic belonging and territorial residence. \nPatterns of policy gaps need to be presented differently in the two \ncases when considering entitlements of foreign residents to social \nand political rights.\n', '724 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\nTo understand this difference, we need to examine internal fea\xad\ntures of policy decisionmaking—prevalent conceptions of the role \nof public policy, and shared attitudes toward citizenship and \nnational community in each country. In Japan, public policy sup\xad\nporting foreign residents is mostly assigned to local rather than \ncentral government. All residents are assured they will be cared for \nby public policy in their everyday lives regardless of nationality. \nHowever, policy inclusion for foreigners seems to be regarded \nmore as a beneficial spillover of good governance than as an enti\xad\ntlement of foreigners as community members. The status of alien \ncitizens is overwhelmingly imagined in terms of coexistence. Pol\xad\nicy intervention for foreign residents is detoured into nonpolitical \nareas such as housing information and interpretation services.\nIn South Korea, local suffrage for long-term permanent resi\xad\ndents was established without serious political resistance. It was a \nsymbolic reform, not only to exhibit human rights concerns for \nminority foreigners, but also to express sympathy for kin foreign\xad\ners by supporting them indirectly through transborder nationalism \n(Brubaker 2010). Although permanent residents have access to \nformal voting rights, they are excluded from social entitlement to \npublic assistance benefits. The status of alien citizens in South \nKorea seems to be predominantly imagined in terms of legal and \nformal membership, not in terms of substantial and material \naspects of livelihood.\nThis comparison intentionally concentrates on institutional \ncontours of residential citizenship by observing overall legal \nframeworks to include permanent residents as policy beneficiar\xad\nies. I emphasize different patterns of policy gaps between South \nKorea and Japan, relying on nation-state-level comparison and \nthus taking the risk of oversimplifying many policy details. This \nresearch can contribute to more empirical investigation that fur\xad\nther elaborates comparisons of complicated policy outcomes.\nNotes\nJung-Mee Hwang is senior researcher at the Institute of Social Science, \nKangwon National University. Her research addresses immigration, citizen-\n', 'Jung-Mee Hwang 725\nship, and gender relations in the context of democratic consolidation in East \nAsia. She can be reached atjmhwangl2@gmail.com.\n1. This research refers to official statistics of registered foreigners pub\xad\nlished by the ministries of justice in South Korea and Japan. The definition \nof registered foreigner is derived from the alien registration system, which \nrequests that all foreigners without nationality register their residence and \npersonal information with the immigration service office if they stay longer \nthan three months. This definition tends to underestimate the actual size of \nresident foreigners by omitting nonregistered groups of foreigners. Given \nthe similarity of systems, however, comparing the number of registered for\xad\neigners is an effective way for cross-national research in this case. The alien \nregistration system still operates in South Korea; however, the Japanese gov\xad\nernment replaced it with a new residency management system to integrate \nforeign residents under local registration systems in July 2012. As the new \nsystem is still in its inaugural stage, its impact is beyond the scope of my \nresearch.\n2. There were only five refusals of naturalization applications in 2001 in \nSouth Korea, but the number increased to 214 in 2002 and 6,973 in 2009 \n(KIS 2010).\n3. When permanent residency visas were first established in South \nKorea, most PR holders were ethnic Chinese who had Taiwanese citizen\xad\nship. Unlike Zainich Koreans in Japan, Hwagyo in South Korea did not \nexpress their voice publicly and were almost forgotten until the building of \nfive “Chinatowns” in several cities to promote local tourism and also to \nattract Chinese tourists. Official foreigner policies, which have been operat\xad\ning since 2008, virtually ignore Hwagyo residents, primarily focusing on \nnewcomer-related agendas such as measures to attract foreign students, \nhuman rights of marriage migrants, and management of foreign laborers.\n4. Among the permanent residency visa holders (100,171) in South \nKorea in recent years, there were 56,134 Korean Chinese (56 percent), \n16,562 other Chinese (16.5 percent), and 13,968 Taiwanese citizens (13.9 \npercent) (KIS 2013). I estimate the Hwagyo population among PR holders \nby counting Taiwanese citizens from official statistics.\n5. Stimulated by the visible economic affluence of South Korea, many \nKorean Chinese who had lived in the Chosunjok Autonomous Region \nlocated in northeast China went to their ancestors’ home country expecting \neconomic success. Language fluency, cultural homogeneity, and active in\xad\ngroup networks make them more able to adjust and settle down in South \nKorea than other foreign workers.\n6. Among three components of citizenship suggested by T. H. Mar\xad\nshall—civil, political, and social rights—this research sets aside civil rights \nfor several reasons. Seen from the viewpoints of foreign residents, civil \nrights are more related to immigration control policy rather than incorpora\xad\ntion policy, as core civil rights are composed of basic liberties, freedom to \nmove, inviolability of domicile, and protection under habeas corpus.\n7. However, there are legal exemptions for the mandatory insurance \nprinciple in cases where foreign workers are employed in small businesses\n', '726 Resident Foreigners in South Korea and Japan\nand agricultural workshops that hire fewer than four employees, or in private \nhouseholds as domestic workers (IOM MRTC 2011).\n8. Resident foreigners voting in South Korean local elections numbered \n6,726 in 2006, and increased to 12,878 in 2010. This comprised only 0.03 \npercent of total voters. The voting rate among permanent residents in 2010 \nwas 32.5 percent, considerably lower than the overall voting rate of 54.5 \npercent (Korea National Election Commission 2010).\nReferences\nAiden, Hardeep S. 2011. “Creating the ‘Multicultural Coexistence’ Society: \nCentral and Local Government Policies Towards Foreign Residents in \nJapan.” Social Science Japan Journal, vol. 14, no. 2 (Summer), pp. \n213-231.\nAleinikoff, Alexander. 1999. “Between National and Postnational: Member\xad\nship in the United States.” Michigan Journal of Race and Law, vol. 4 \n(Spring), pp. 241-262.\nAsis, Maruja M.
