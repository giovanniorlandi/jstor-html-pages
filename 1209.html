I bad a\nnumber of akin tumours small\nones on my arms which bad never\ngiven me serious trouble ; but about\ntwo years ago one came on my\nthroat. At first it was only about as\nlarge as a pinhead, but, as it was in\na position where my collar, if not\njust right, would irritate it, it soon\nbecame very sensitive and bepan to\ngrow rapidly. Last spring it was\nss large, if not larger, than a bean.\nA little unusual irritation of my\ncollar started it to swelling, and in\na day or two it was as large as\nhalf an orange. I was very much\nalarmed,\' and was at a loss to de\ntermine whether it was a carbuncle\nor a malignant tumour. \'\n" My friends tried to persuade me\nto consult my physician ; but dread\ning that he would insist on using\nthe knife, I Would not consent to\ngo. Instead I got a small bottle of\nCuticurftResolvent and a box of Cu\nticura Ointment I took the former\naccording to directions, and jpread\na thick layer of tluwlntmunt on a\nlinen cloth and placed it on the\nswelling. On renewing it I would\nbathe my neck in very warm water\nand Cuticura Soap. In a few days\nthe Cuticura Ointment had drawn\nthe swelling to a head, when it\nbroke. - Every morning it was opened\nwith a large sterilized needle,\nsqueezed and bathed, and fresh\nOintment put on.

I.\n"About five or six years ago my\nsister had a similar experience, tihe\nhad two large lumps come under\'\nher right arm, the result of a sprain.\nThey grew rapidly, and our physi\ncian wanted to cut them out. I\nwould not listen to it, and she tried\nthe Cuticura Remedies (as 1 did a\nfew months ago) with magical effect\nIn six weeks\' time the lumps\' had\nentirely disappeared, aud have never\nreturned.\n" 1 have great faith in the Cuticura\nRemedies, and I believe they might\nbe as efficacious in similar cases\nwith other people, and thus save\nmuch suffering, and perhaps life. I\nhave derived so much benefit from\nthe use of them myself that I am\nconstantly advising\nothers to use them.

She \'\nwas confined to her bed,\nand was unable to speak, when her\ndaughter, at my suggestion, tried\nthe effect of the Cuticura Ointment\nand Cuticura Resolvent. Strange to\nsay, she was very shortly relieved of\nthe most distressing symptoms. The\nswelling seemed to be exteriorized,\nand she is now able to be around\nher house, and can talk as well as\never.\n" It seems to me that I have pretty\ngood grounds \' for believing that\nCuticura Remedies will prove sue\ncesdful in the most distressing form\nof blood and Bkin humours, and if\nyou wish to use my testimonial as\nherein indicated, I am willing that\nyou should do so, with the further\nprivilege of revealing my name and\naddress to such persons as may wish\nto substantiate the above state\nments by personal letter to me." \'\nChicago, Nov, 12, 190J.\nTORTURING\nDISFIGURING\nSkin, Scalp and Blood\nHumours\nSpeeiy Cored by Cuticura\nSoap, Ointment and Pills\nWhen the Best Physicians and\nAll Else Fail.\nThe igonliliig Itching and burning\not the skin, as Id ecicma ; the frightful\nscaling, as In pioriasi ; the lost of hair\nand crusting of the scalp, win seal led\nhead: the facial disfigurements, as tn\npimples and ringworm ; the awful suf\nfering ot Infants, and anxiety ot worn\nout parents, at In milk crust, tetter and\nalt rheura, all detntud a remedy ot\nalmost superhuman virtue to success\nfully cope with them.
