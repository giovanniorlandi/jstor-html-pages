Your name will have\ninfluence and your dollar will help in the campaign\nof education- It will buy literature and stamps,\nhelp pay speakers and for space in the newspapers,\nlivery bills, telephone and telegraph bills, rent for\nroom in which to hold meetings, etc.. etc.\nAnd just here be it understood that no worker in\nthe city or county is receiving one cent of compen\nsation for his services, except Miss Wilson, who\nhas for months given all her time from early till\nlate in ofliice work. Up to date she has been paid\nnothing and no sum has been promised her. She\nBays first pay all other expenses and if there is\nanything left when the election is over she can\nbe paid.

Both organizations have their work to\ndo and working together are invincible.\nTHE STRENGTH OF THE WOMAN\'S\nCHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION in any com\nmunity depends upon the women in that com\nmunity. Every Christina woman in Maysville and\nMason county should belong to or work with the\nloeal union and the strongest women in the county\nshould be its officers. If the W. C. T.

Taft found it so when ho heenme Presi\ndent, and he bewailed the fact but could not\n\' change it.\nJt was one of the first things that Mr. Wilson\nnoted, and in a half comic, half pathetic talk\nto the members of the National Press Club, many\nmouths ago, he expressed his sense of isolation\nand the feeling that he had come to rank as a\nsort of impersonal exhibition, like the National\nMuseum, the Washington Monument or the\nSmithsonian Institution.\nHe is, moreover, the type of man whose life is\nlargely within himself, and a man of that type,\nno matter how hard he may try and no matter\nhow much he may mingle with men of all classes,\nis bound to have a certain aloofness that he can\nnever overcome. One writer observed months ago\nthat "it may be doubted that we have ever had\niu the higher public life of this country a man\nso detached, so essentially solitary." Current\nOpinion.\n\'wyy-asa\nTHE, CHRISTMAS SHIP\nIdealistic trnd thoroughly American is the plan\ninaugurated by the Chicago American to have\nAmerican children send to the war orphans iu\nstricken Europe n great Christmas ship- A mes\nsage of this kind from the children of the United\nStates to the children of the old country will go\nfar toward relieving the gloom which will be felt\nmost during Yulptide.\nThe plan is still in the formative period. But\nthere is ample time in which to collect funds, pro\nvide for n shipload of gifts, and arrange with the\nvarious governments for their safe transportation\nand delivery. It will be n hugo undertaking, but\none which should win hearty and liberal support.\nChristmas of 1911 will at best be a heart-breaking\nevent in millions of European homes. In\nthousands there will be no fathers or brothers to\nprovide the traditional gifts. American children\nit may be taken for granted, will eagerly share\ntheir abundance with the pathetic little girls and\nboys oT the Old World, who otherwise may have to\ngo without the things that to the juvenile heart\nare the symbols of the Christmas spirit. Win\nChester (Ky.) Sun.\nTHE AMENITIES OF WAR\nThere was a time when even educated men held\nthat it was one\'s duty o hate and detest the enemy\nduring war and to rejoice in his agony and misery.\nCruel and barbarous as war is, we have at least\nabandoned that monstrous notion. There is evi\n, -donee that in the present war made by autocrats\nand medieval military and diplomatic minds the\npeoples engaged in the conflict hate one another\nThere is much evidence to the contrary. A French\nctricer sends word to the mother of a German\naviator that "the brave fellow" died of injuries\nwhile framing a message for her at home. The\nbrave German speaks of the "kindness of the\nFrench oiTicers." The first lord of the British\nadmiralty asks the United States to convey a mes\nsage to a German admiral that his son is safe and\nunwounded. Returned tourists say that many Ger\nmans express profound regret that the French,\nwho did not seek war, should, under the compulsion\nof necessity and strategy, have to pay so heavy\na price for their alliance with Russia. Finally, iii\nthe statements issued by the respective war offices,\nthe gallantry and courage of the fighters on the\nother side are frankly recognized and almost\npraised. (From The Chicago Tribune.)\nCRUELTY OF WAR\nNever were the cruelties of war more forcibly\nMiown than in the present compulsory action by\nwhich the residents of the outskirts of Paris are\ncalled upon to \'destroy their homes. Many of the\npeople lack resources and much suflering is certain\nto result\'. Surely the present conflict has no\nmercy. Buffalo Commercial.\nThis is a bad year for rats. On top of the New\nOrleans war of extermination comes the news that\na cat with two heads has been born iu New Jersey.\nLouisville Times.\nThat the big war in Europe will end in less\nthan sixty days is a pretty safe bet.\nSTREAK OF MEANNESS\nBurns sings of "man\'s inhumanity to man," but,\nof course, he includes woman, too. This often hap\npens. On an open tiolley, the other day, a lady re\nquested another to move over a bit, when the latter\nangrily responded "move over yourself," and re\nfused to budge, so the lady got into a hack seat,\nwhere they made room. In a little while the woman\naccosted left the car, but all this time she nursed\nher wrath, for as she stepped off she spitefully said\nto the other, "think people must move over for\nvou not much I"\nScenes like this often happen. As a general ride\nwomen are ruder than men. They consider it a\nright to retain the whole space, if they are the fir?\'\nto occupy it. There is no accounting for this on\nany psychological grounds, except upon doctrine of\noriginal sin. No person who Is educated or cul\ntured will treat another that way. Tn fact, he will\nmove over without being nsked to.
