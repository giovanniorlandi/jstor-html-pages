        <pre>['“It is very likely that China will lengthen her lead over the ordinary \nless developed nations during the next decade. But it is not clear that she \ncan narrow the gap between her economy and that of the dynamic cap\xad\nitalist industrial nations, or prevent the gap from widening.”\nChina’s Industry: Strengths and \nWeaknesses\nB y  K u a n - I  C h e n\nProfessor of Economics, State University of New York at Albany\nin ce  1949, the Chinese leadership has been \nguiding China’s immense human assets and \nrich natural resources toward the building of \na modern industrial state self-sufficient in technology, \ncapable of providing sufficient utilitarian goods for \nthe masses, and supporting a sizable modern defense \ncapacity. The record so far has been a mixed one—  \nimpressive successes on many fronts of the industrial \nsector, partial failures and unfinished tasks.\nAlthough extremely limited statistics on total in\xad\ndustrial production were released by the Chinese gov\xad\nernment in the past decade, several estimates on Chi\xad\nnese industrial growth have been made by experts on \nChina in the West. Their works, especially the re\xad\ncent estimates of Robert M. Field1 and Thomas Raw- \nski1 2, provide sufficient information for a picture of \nChinese industrial growth during the period 1949- \n1972.3 Based on Robert Field’s production series, it \nappears that China’s industrial sector has grown at \nan average annual rate of 10.9-11.2 per cent during \n1949-1972. The industrial output in 1949 was be\xad\n1 Robert M.

This source estimated the index of total in\xad\ndustrial production for the period 1949-1970 and gave in\xad\ndustrial growth rate at 12 per cent for 1971.\n2 Thomas Rawski, “ Recent Trends in the Chinese Econ- \nomy,”  The China Quarterly, January/March, 1973, pp. \n1-33. This source estimated the index of total industrial \nproduction for the period 1957-1971.\n3 The industrial production growth rate for 1972 was \nestimated as 10 per cent. See Thomas W. Robinson, \n“ China in 1972: Socio-Economic Progress Amidst Political \nUncertainty,”  Asian Survey, January, 1973, pp. 14-15.\n4 Barry M. Richman, Industrial Society in Communist \nChina (New York: Random House, 1969), p. 600.\n5 This estimate was based on data in Arthur G. Ashbrook, \nJr-’ “ China’s Economic Policy and Economic Result, 1949— \n71,” People’s Republic of China: An Economic Assessment, \nJoint Economic Committee, U.S. Congress (Washington, \nD.C.: Government Printing Office, May 18, 1972), pp. 42, \n46, 47. The industrial sector’s share in 1970 was 30 per \ncent as estimated from these data. The share may further \nincrease to 33-34 per cent by 1972.\nlow the pre-1949 peak and the use of 1949 as a base \nyear may have overstated the long-term industrial \ngrowth rate of China. Since the industrial output in \n19514 surpassed the pre-1949 peak, the use of the pe\xad\nriod 1951-1972 more than eliminates the upward bias \nof long-term growth rate. Even for the period 1951- \n1972 China’s industrial sector still advanced at a \nfairly high annual rate of 9.3-9.6 per cent. Thus, by \n1972, China’s industrial output was 10 or 11 times as \nhigh as it had been in 1949 and 6 or 7 times as high \nas it was in 1951. In short, China has made fairly \nimpressive gains in long-term industrial growth, al\xad\nthough the rate of growth was much less impressive \nthan that of Japan in the same period.\nEven though China’s long-term industrial growth \nhas been strong, it has been rather erratic. The aver\xad\nage annual growth rate (based on Field’s series) was \n27 per cent for 1949-1952, 14 per cent for 1952-1957, \n2.9-3.8 per cent for 1957-1963, 5.0-6.1 per cent for \n1957-1965 and 8.5-8.9 per cent for 1965-1972. Based \non Rawski’s production series, the annual industrial \ngrowth rate of China also shows much fluctuation \nduring these periods: 19.2 per cent for 1952-1957, \n7.7-10.1 per cent for 1957-1963, 9.0-10.8 per cent \nfor 1957-1965 and 9.9 per cent for 1965-1972. How\xad\never, Rawski’s estimates of growth rates are signif\xad\nicantly higher than those of Field. Part of the differ\xad\nence arises from the fact that Field’s production index \nincludes slow-growing individual handicrafts while \nRawski’s dees not.\nAs a result of rapid growth in the industrial sector, \nstructural change has occurred within the Chinese \neconomy. The industrial sector’s share of the Chinese \nGNP may have increased from about 18 per cent in \n1957 to around one-third5 in 1972, while agriculture’s \nshare may have declined from about 48 per cent to \napproximately 26 per cent. Given a GNP of around \n$140 billion for 1972, the industrial output may reach \nthe level of $45 billion.\n115\n', '116 • CURRENT H ISTORYj SEPTEM BER, 1973\nHEAVY INDUSTRY\nThe fulfillment of the goal of building a modern \nindustrial state self-sufficient in technology and capa\xad\nble of supporting a sizable modern defense capacity \nrequires a large investment in heavy industry. But \nthe concentration of investment in heavy industry \nduring the past 20 years has resulted in a substantial \nchange in the relative importance of the broad func\xad\ntional sectors of industry. During the period 1952— \n1970, the industrial materials sector has expanded \nmore rapidly than any other sector— an expansion of \n569-673 per cent.6 The output of iron and steel, ce\xad\nment, timber and building materials has increased \nrapidly, but chemical fertilizer has shown the most \nspectacular growth. The output of the machinery \nsector increased by 470-559 per cent between 1952 \nand 1970. The rapid growth of this sector could have \nbeen anticipated, since it is the crucial sector for at\xad\ntaining the goal of self-reliance and for supporting \nthe modem defense capacity. This sector now pro\xad\nduces machine tools, antifriction bearings, agricul\xad\ntural machinery, tractors, trucks, diesel locomotives, \nocean-going vessels, metallurgical equipment, power \ngenerators, chemical equipment, petroleum extraction \nand refining equipment, computers, electronics, nu\xad\nclear reactors, among other machinery.\nThe fuels and power sector also grew rapidly dur\xad\ning 1952-1970, increasing 467-555 per cent. The \noutstanding achievement in this sector was the prog\xad\nress made in the petroleum industry. China im\xad\nported over 90 per cent of her oil needs in the early \n1950’s, but she is now essentially self-sufficient in \ncrude oil and has produced a complete line of pe\xad\ntroleum products. China’s recent agreement to ex\xad\nport 200,000 tons of crude oil to Japan signals the \nbeginning of a growing surplus for export.\nThe light industry sector registered the smallest \ngain during 1952-1970, an increase of only 102-134 \nper cent. As a result, this sector’s share of total in\xad\ndustrial production dropped from 56 per cent in 1952 \nto only 29 per cent in 1970. In contrast, the share \nof the industrial materials sector increased from 20 \nper cent in 1952 to 34 per cent in 1970; the share of \nthe machinery sector increased from 13 per cent to \n20 per cent and that of the fuels and power sector rose \nfrom 12 per cent to 17 per cent. As industry grows \nrapidly over the next few years, change in sectoral \nshare is expected to continue.\nA brief review of the change in Chinese economic \ndevelopment strategy during the past 23 years will \nhelp us to understand past and present industrial pol\xad\nicy— what the current policy intends to accomplish\n6 Robert M. Field, op. cit.. pp. 66-68.\n7 Li-Jen Shen. “ Lun Chiakuai nungyehchidtu kaitsao \nwenti”  (On Promoting Transformation of Agricultural \nTechnology), Chingchi yenchiu (Economic Research), 1960, \nNo. 3.\nand what the consequences of that policy are in terms \nof the strengths and weaknesses of Chinese industrial \ndevelopment. The period 1949-1952 was essentially \none of restoration of economic “ law and order,”  con\xad\nsolidation of government control over the economy, \nrebuilding of the existing industrial facilities, and ex\xad\npansion in selected sectors of the economy. The pe\xad\nriod 1953-1957 covered the first five-year plan which \nwas characterized as forced-draft industrialization in \nthe Soviet style. The priority was to expand rapidly \nthe capacity and output of heavy industrial products \nsuch as steel, coal, electric power, cement, machinery \nand other basic industrial commodities. Very limited \ninvestment funds were allocated to expand the mod\xad\nem inputs for agriculture. Thus most efforts were di\xad\nverted to the development of heavy industry, espe\xad\ncially to those branches which could turn out pro\xad\nducers’ goods for the further expansion of heavy in\xad\ndustry. In the meantime, the policy of regional de\xad\nvelopment was followed. Industrial capacity in the \nold industrial centers was modernized, and produc\xad\ntion was pushed toward full capacity, while large new \nplants were located in the inland area. Such inland \ndevelopment was possible because huge electric power \nplants were built in the middle reaches of the Yellow \nRiver and new rail link systems were established.\nTHE GREAT LEAP FORWARD\nThe strategy of the Great Leap Forward during \n1958-1960 was to continue the development of heavy \nindustry in the typical Soviet model together with the \ndevelopment of agriculture. In effect, it called for \nthe simultaneous development of two distinct indus\xad\ntrial sectors: a modern large-scale, capital intensive \nsector and a traditional small-scale labor-intensive \nsector in the communes through mass mobilization of \npeasants. The modern sector continued its task of ex\xad\npanding the heavy industrial base, especially on basic \nindustrial commodities, with very limited resources al\xad\nlocated to the production of modern inputs for agri\xad\nculture. The traditional sector would eventually de\xad\nvelop peasant industries, including backyard furnaces \nfor iron and steel making, to meet the needs of com\xad\nmunes for agricultural producer goods.\nAt its peak, there were 3 million traditional small- \nscale factories (or mini-installations), but only 200,- \n000 of these factories7 survived the process of read\xad\njustment and remained in operation by 1960. It soon \nbecame obvious that such traditional peasant industry \ncould not raise the yield of foodgrains significantly in \nas short a time as anticipated. Modem but small in\xad\ndustry would be needed to provide effective capital \ngoods for raising the agricultural yield. However, the \npeasant at that time did not possess the skills and re\xad\nsources to construct such small modern factories on \na large scale. The then existing small heavy industry \nbase in the urban centers, especially the machine\n', 'building branch, was not able to lend much support \nto such more modern small industry. The withdrawal \nfrom China of Russian experts, together with their \nblueprints for new plants and machinery, and the \nSoviet decision to stop sending machinery and parts \nto these new plants greatly disrupted the normal func\xad\ntioning of the existing heavy industrial base. Three \nsuccessive years of poor weather added to the disrup\xad\ntive effects of the first-stage introduction of the new \ncommune system and the new experiment in peasant \nindustry. A combination of these and other factors \nultimately caused the Great Leap to end in economic \ncrisis.\nThe period 1961-1966 saw the adoption of a new \neconomic policy which was based on “ agriculture as \nthe foundation and industry as the leading factor.”  \nIts focus was agricultural recovery and development; \ngreater inputs from the modern industry were to be \nchanneled into farm production. Consumer goods \nindustries were, at least officially, accorded higher pri\xad\nority than producer goods branches, because con\xad\nsumer goods not only generate funds for the develop\xad\nment of heavy industry but also provide incentives \nfor the farm population. Essentially, this was a strat\xad\negy of securing balanced growth in the economy. \nWithin the heavy industry sector, the emphasis shifted \nto chemical fertilizers, irrigation pumps, piping farm \nimplements and small power plants.\nBecause after 1960 the Soviet Union joined the \nUnited States in waging a cold war against China, \neconomic self-sufficiency and self-reliance in technol\xad\nogy became the urgent goal. Domestic industry, \ntherefore, was also called upon to expand such indus\xad\ntries as petroleum, electronics and advanced weapons. \nThe machine-building industry expanded not only \nquantitatively but also in variety and quality. Thus \nduring this period Chinese industry entered a new, \ncrucial stage of development which is reflected by the \nimpressive progress made in producing a whole range \nof new industrial goods and the near self-sufficiency in \nmachinery production. The success in shifting indus\xad\ntrial priorities to chemical and petroleum products \nreflects a newly acquired ability to apply “ technical \nknowledge, skills and facilities to produce new ma\xad\nchinery to meet the changing needs of productive ac\xad\ntivity.”  This new ability puts China a few steps \ncloser to a mature industrial technology society.\nThe policy for the period from 1967 to the present \nhas been to continue the major elements of the in\xad\ndustrial policy adopted since 1961. This period also \ncovered the Great Cultural Revolution, which lasted \nfrom the latter part of 1966 to the early part of 1969.\n8 “ Local Industry in China,”  Peking Review, September \n24. 1971. pp. 9-11. _\n9 “ Following Chairman Mao’s directives for the road \nforward of agricultural mechanization,” by writing group of \nthe First Ministry of Industry, People’s Daily, September\nAlthough the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution \ncaused shortages and delays which adversely affected \nindustrial production, the construction of new indus\xad\ntrial projects, nevertheless, continued at a good rate \nin the inland area during the Cultural Revolution; \nthe investment program in agriculture was also main\xad\ntained at a high level. Therefore, the momentum of \ndecentralization in industrial development and re\xad\ngional development in the hinterland did not slow \ndown during the Cultural Revolution.\nSMALL INDUSTRIES\nSince 1969, however, there has been a fresh devel\xad\nopment— a rapid expansion of the small industries in \nthe countryside. Actually, in 1965-1968, the con\xad\nstruction of small power plants, chemical fertilizer \nplants and agricultural machinery shops in rural areas \nbegan to expand. But since 1969, small factories that \nsupplied materials and fuel to these three branches \nhave mushroomed. The pace of construction and ex\xad\npansion of these small plants accelerated in 1970— \n1971. Thousands of these plants, in medium and \nsmall size, have been built or expanded in provincial \nand county centers.\nThese new small local industries in China have \nbeen organized with the emphasis on serving agricul\xad\nture. They can be conveniently classified in three \nbroad groups. The first group is “ process industries,” \nwhich produce iron and steel, cement, chemical fer\xad\ntilizers, coal, electricity and machinery. It was re\xad\nported in 1971 that half of China’s counties8 have \nbuilt up a complete set of these small industries. The \nsecond group is the “ farm machinery repair and \nmanufacturing network,”  consisting of units at county, \ncommune and brigade levels. This three-level net\xad\nwork generally repairs and manufactures at the county \nlevel, repairs and assembles at the commune level, and \nmerely repairs at the brigade level.9\nThe third group of small industries consists of light \nindustrial plants processing agricultural and side-line \nproducts such as canned fruits, soya sauce and flour. \nPlants or shops of larger size are more often operated \nby county level enterprise and those of smaller size \nare apt to be found within communes and brigades.\nThus the Chinese have tackled the problem of \nindustrialization simultaneously on two fronts since \naround 1969. The old front was to expand large-size \nmodem plants in the urban centers through regional \ndevelopment utilizing the spill-over tactic which, in \nturn, built new bases, large or medium in size, with \nthe support o f the established plants. The new front \nis the industrialization of rural areas, with the build\xad\ning of a system of integrated small industries. There\xad\nfore, the expanded modern inputs for agriculture are \ncoming not only from large-scale modern enterprises \nwhich embody more or less advanced technology, but \nalso in increasing extent from small local industrial\nChina’s Industry • 117\n', '118 • CU RRENT H ISTORY, SEPTEM BER, 1973\nenterprises which embody an intermediate technology \n— a technology which is much more primitive than \nthe latest technology but is much more sophisticated \nthan the traditional techniques employed by small in\xad\nstallations during the Great Leap period.\nThe local plants built in recent years have several \ncharacteristics in common. They are built chiefly \nwith local funds, labor and construction materials, al\xad\nthough at least part of their equipment initially came \nfrom the most advanced equipment plants. Since \nthey mainly serve a local agricultural area, their out\xad\nput can be made to dovetail with seasonal demands \nof farming and local needs. They utilize the skilled \nlabor force and better educated youths sent out from \nthe cities during the Cultural Revolution and benefit \nfrom the new school system which is overwhelmingly \nvocation-oriented. They incorporate the latest tech\xad\nnology available in China for similar size and kind of \nplant as a result of a well established system of spread\xad\ning the technology established at one plant to another \nwithin the same level or at a different level.\nWhat benefits do the Chinese economic policymak\xad\ners expect to gain from this program of small local \nindustry? The policymakers apparently realize that \nunder the prevailing technological capacity and the \nsystem of investment fund control, many local finan\xad\ncial, human and material resources in China cannot \nbe readily utilized in big modem plants embodying \nthe latest technology. Instead of leaving these scat\xad\ntered resources in idleness or converting them into \ninnumerable jerry-built mini-factories similar to those \nof the Great Leap period, resources should probably \nbe converted into relatively more modem small fac\xad\ntories for the production of utilitarian goods for the \nrural population as well as for agriculture as soon as \nChina masters the intermediate technology. The pro\xad\nduction of small industry should be expected to sup\xad\nplement (for the most part) rather than to replace \nthe output of big modem enterprises. Therefore, at \nthe present stage of economic development this pro\xad\ngram would strengthen the Chinese economy in sev\xad\neral ways.\nFirst, the agricultural sector would obtain increas\xad\ning supplies of useful, though low quality, chemical \nfertilizers, cement, machinery, and so on, with a min\xad\nimum diversion of supporting resources from the mod\xad\nem core of the industrial sector. Because the pro\xad\ngram has a boosting effect on crop yield as well as \nlight industrial output and has dovetailed with the \ndevelopment of larger industrial bases in inland areas, \nit speeds up the pace of modernization.\nSecond, since small industry serves mainly local \nrural areas and its output in goods and services could \nbe made to dovetail with seasonal demand and local \nneed, it would help to save a considerable amount of \ntransportation investment expenses in a country with \nrelatively poor transportation facilities; it would also\nprovide more satisfactory services to the local custom\xad\ners. A number of visitors to China in the past two \nor three years have noticed that local stores and shops, \neven in the isolated areas, seem to be fairly well \nstocked with utilitarian goods. The long line of \nshoppers waiting their turn, so often observed in the \nSoviet bloc, is visibly absent in China. Decentraliza\xad\ntion, made possible by a large number of local small \nfactories and stores, is probably the chief reason for \nthis improved supply situation.\nThird, this program would create non-farm em\xad\nployment close to home for millions of farm youths \ncoming out of the primary and middle schools. Local \nindustry programs make it possible for many people \nto participate in decision-making as well as in the \nconstruction of small plants and allow them to get \napprentice training in these plants. If the experience \nof the process of industrial development by the masses \nis the key to rapid modernization for an underdevel\xad\noped country, then small local industry in China def\xad\ninitely provides the experience to millions of rural \npeople. Such educational fall-out will serve as a val\xad\nuable stepping stone for raising the overall level of \ntechnology for local small industry in the foreseeable \nfuture.\nFourth, generally speaking, only a moderate amount \nof capital is required for a small plant; it is therefore \nwithin the means of the commune or county to finance \nsuch a venture. In addition, the construction (or \ngestation) period for a small plant is relatively short \nand the initial capital, especially for light industry, \ncould normally be recovered within a comparatively \nshort time. Thus from the standpoint of capital for\xad\nmation, considerable net benefits may be derived from \nthe small industry program. Lastly, the development \nof small industry may also play an important role in \nfulfilling the policymakers’ goals: promotion of (1) \nthe desired geographical distribution of industrial fa\xad\ncilities and (2) the development of technology and \nresearch appropriate to the varied conditions and \nresources of China.\nBecause China is still an underdeveloped country \nand has had a relatively short industrial history, the \nstrengths of Chinese industry can best be judged in \nterms of the progress made in the industrial sector \ntoward the fulfillment of China’s overriding national \ngoals considering her background: no standing long\xad\nterm foreign debt, no foreign direct investment, no \nforeign long-term loan and technical aid since 1960, \nand subject to foreign embargo of high technology \nproducts, especially from the United States, until \n1972. China has achieved a fairly rapid long-term \nannual growth rate in industrial production in the \npast 23 years and has accomplished the task of train\xad\ning and seasoning a fairly large industrial labor \nforce, managers and technicians. Therefore, China \nhas an effective modern industrial base which is strong\n', 'China’s Industry • 119\nin basic industrial materials, heavy machinery and \nmodern armament. She is currently designing and \nconstructing nearly all her new industrial plants, large \nand small, and has achieved self-sufficiency in pe\xad\ntroleum. With the natural resources adequate to \nsupport a major industrial economy, she can now \nrely predominantly on her own resources— technical, \ncapital and natural— to expand her heavy and light \nindustry. Essentially, China has acquired the capa\xad\nbility for self-generating industrial growth.\nIn the area of modern armament, China’s heavy \nindustry is turning out a sizable number of jet air\xad\ncrafts, submarines, tanks, intermediate-range missiles \nand nuclear warheads. This indicates that China not \nonly has a diversified machine-building industry but \nalso has made a breakthrough in the highly sophisti\xad\ncated technology associated with advanced weapon \nproduction. Despite the modern armament burden, \nChina’s heavy industry continues to send growing sup\xad\nplies of manufactured inputs to the farming sector, \nand the lot of the rank-and-file worker and peasant \nis steadily improving. Small local industry should \nget the credit for playing a valuable role in tackling \nthe problem of supplying adequate manufactured \nproducts for both farming and consumers. In sev\xad\neral respects, China now has a considerable lead over \nthe average less developed nations.\nINDUSTRIAL WEAKNESS\nNotwithstanding her progress, China’s total GNP \nand her steel production is close to the French, al\xad\nthough China’s population is about 16 times as large \nas that of France. The weaknesses of China’s indus\xad\ntry would show up distinctly if we judge it by the \nstandard of a major industrial nation. First, the \ntechnological base remains weak in a number of areas \nsuch as chemical, metallurgical, and oil refining equip\xad\nment, ocean freighters, special steel, heavy-duty \ntrucks, special-purpose vehicles and communication \nequipments. Continued imports of these products \nimply that domestic manufacturers are not able to \nprovide needed equipment of the appropriate specifi\xad\ncations and quantity. Second, at present the overall \nlevel of industrial technology in China is still 5 to 20 \nyears behind that of advanced industrialized nations, \nalthough China has succeeded in reducing her gap \nrelative to these nations during the past two decades. \nAccording to a Japanese study,10 China’s technological \nlevel is 15 years behind Japan in machine tools and \nsteel, 10 years in hydraulic machines and chemical \nindustry, and 20 years in automation.\nThird, one of the weakest links in China’s overall \nindustrial development is her mass-production sys10\nTakahashi, Present State and Problematical Points of \nthe Communist Chinese Economy, China Affairs Division, \nAsia Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan, December’ \n1968.\ntern, which is at least 25 years behind the world level. \nThis is explained by the brief industrial history of \nChina and by the policy of regional self-sufficiency \nand decentralization. For example, the automotive \nindustry in China consists of two dozen or more \nmanufacturing and repair plants. Nearly every prov\xad\nince has a plant capable of assembling and partially \nmanufacturing several thousand vehicles a year. \nHowever, the largest plant turns out only 35,000 to \n40,000 vehicles annually. It is important to note \nthat the automotive industry in China, though prim\xad\nitive and small by an industrialized nation’s standard, \nis not classified as a small industry. The Chinese in\xad\ndustrial sector has apparently made more headway in \nareas that require highly sophisticated scientific know\xad\nhow but need no mass-production (engineering and \nmanagement) techniques. Thus there is a contrast \nbetween the relatively primitive production-line tech\xad\nnique used in the automotive industry and the ability \nto produce third-generation computers and fissile ura\xad\nnium with gaseous diffusion techniques and to launch \nspace satellites.\nFourth, in cases where appropriate precision, chem\xad\nical purity or physical property is required, the manu\xad\nfactured products from small local industry would \nprobably be inferior to those from modern large \nplants. In 1971, small local plants produced 60 per \ncent of China’s total chemical fertilizer output, 40 \nper cent of the total cement output, a smaller but still \nconsiderable percentage of the total iron and coal. \nTaking chemical fertilizers as an example, most fer\xad\ntilizers produced by small plants are of low quality, \nsuch as aqua ammonia and ammonium bicarbonate, \nboth low in nutrients. In addition, decomposition is \na more serious problem when these products are ex\xad\nposed to weather or placed in storage. Although \nthese products are no doubt helpful to crop yield, any \nlarge dependence on small plants implies a continuing \ninability to turn out sufficient equipment for larger \nchemical plants. The same interpretation may also \napply to the metallurgy and cement industries.\nLastly, in order to overcome possible delay in the \nproduction schedule as a result of either shortages or \nunduly high cost of machinery and parts, even the \nlarge and medium plants often make some of the ma\xad\nchinery and equipment needed in their own plants. \nAlthough this practice makes sense for the Chinese \neconomy at the present stage of development, it indi\xad\ncates a lack of specialization on the plant level as well \n(Continued on page 134)\nKuan-I Chen has taught at Tallcdega College and \nFairleigh Dickinson University.

One of the tasks is to upgrade con\xad\nsiderably the technology embodied in small local in\xad\ndustry, especially in the chemical and metallurgy \nindustries. The establishment of a number of enter\xad\nprises which provide specialized services and spare \nparts for industries will also be essential. As the \neconomy is steadily growing more complex, the pres\xad\nent work incentive system will have to be modified and \nthe growing problem of departmentalism (or bureau\xad\ncracy) that stifles innovation and efficiency will have \nto be tackled. A  happy medium between the oppo\xad\nsite poles of ideological extremism and managerial, \ntechnical and economic rationality for an increas\xad\ningly complex economy will have to be established. \nThe current vocationally oriented education system \nwill also have to be upgraded, and research on high- \nlevel applied technology should be accelerated. In \naddition, the training of high-level managerial per\xad\nsonnel should be emphasized.\nThe large-scale import of advanced industrial \nplants, especially machine plants, license arrangement \nfor production of specialized products and so on, \nwhich are now limited only by the amount of foreign \nexchange available, will accelerate the gains. Be\xad\ncause of improved international relations with cap\xad\nitalist industrialized nations, China could solve the \nproblem of foreign exchange shortages by permitting \njoint development of Chinese petroleum and coal re\xad\nsources. The arrangement between Occidental Pe\xad\ntroleum Corporation in the United States and the \nSoviet Union with regard to chemical fertilizers and \nnatural gas may offer a guide to future arrangements \nbetween China and these nations.\nIt is very likely that China will lengthen her lead \nover the ordinary less developed nations during the \nnext decade. But it is not clear that she can narrow \nthe gap between her economy and that of the dynamic \ncapitalist industrialized nations, or prevent the gap \nfrom widening.\nFOOD AND AGRICULTURAL \nPROBLEMS\n(Continued from page 123)\ngrains in the first 2 decades of the Republic thus \nbarely kept pace with population growth, leaving per \ncapita grain output almost unchanged. If the cur\xad\nrent annual growth rate of 1.9 per cent continues, by \n1992, Chinese population would reach 1.2 billion, an \nincrease of 46 per cent. With a 46 per cent increase \nin population, a 100  per cent increase in foodgrain \noutput in the coming two decades should improve \nthe country’s living standard. The problem is: Can \nChinese grain output double in the next 20 years?\nDuring the first 10 years of development, about 40 \nper cent of the Chinese foodgrain growth was due to \nthe increase in sown areas, mainly through the rise of \nmultiple cropping; and about 60 per cent of the \ngrowth was due to the increase in yields per acre.27 \nIn the period following the agricultural crisis (196127\nField, op. cit.\n']</pre>
