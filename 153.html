Therefore, the drive being made\nfor recruits in all parts of the country\nis claiming thousands of young men,\nand it is pleasing to know that they\nwill be given advantages that have\nbeen accorded the soldiers of no coun\ntry in the past.\nThe world\'s greatest war now being\nover, the American army is now being\nreorganized on a peace footing on\nplans that will make it more attrac\ntive and therefore more effective than\nit has been been at any time in the na\ntion\'s history. It has been the coun\ntry\'s mainstay in times of war with\nother countries; it is now to be its\nmainstay in times of peace. On this\naccount the best young men of the na\ntion are wanted, and this includes\nycung men of foreign birth who have\nnot been naturalized, but who will de\nclare that they intend to be natural\nized.

Morrison is a fine looking\nyoung soldier, and tho\' little more\nthan a boy in years he has been thru\nsome of the thickest of the fighting.\nHa will be very welcome in Ocala\nwhere almost every man over twenty\none has been in the service.\nITINERARIES OF INCOME\nTAX DEPUTY COLLECTORS\nFebruary 9th to March 15th\nJacksonville," Feb-. 4 All plans have\nbeen completed and the itineraries\ndecided upon for all of the deputy\ncollectors of internal revenue who are\nto participate in the current income\ntax drive in the district of Florida,\nfrom now until its conclusion, March\n15th.\nCollector of Internal Revenue Jas.\nM .Cathcart announces the itinerary\nof the entire staff, showing the name\nof the deputy, and the place he is to\nbe. Regarding Marion and Levy coun\nties, it is as follows:\nDeputy Collector W. H. Ford: Ocala,\nfederal building, Feb. 9-14.\nDeputy Collector G. E.

Such a man is privileged to\ntake out his final papers immediately\nafter being discharged from the ser\nvice. Just as soon as men of this class\nare enlisted they are sent to one of\nthe great recruit educational centers,\nwhere they are taught to speak Eng\nlish in a thorough manner, following\nwhich they are given equally thorough\ninstructions in other educational\nbranches." Particular attention, in\nfact, is devoted to training them so\nthat they can advance more rapidly\nin the army and have their rank and\npay increased from year to year.\nAppeal to Americans\nThere are many American boys who\nare being robbed of educational ad\nvantages and practical training that\nwould fit them for success. Some of\nthese will never have these advantages\nas long as they remain at home. To\nsuch as these the offering of the reg\nular army should make quick appeal.\nWhy not get these advantages while\nbeing paid from $30 a month up and\nreceiving your board, home, clothing\nand medical and dental treatment at\nUncle Sam\'s expense? Thousands\nhave had it in the past, while hundreds\nhave managed to save large sums\nduring their terms of service. Thou\nsands have gone out of the army and\nmet with success in different voca\ntions; thousands have remained in the\nservice for thirty years, and then re\ntired with large savings and three\nfourths of their regular pay for the\nbalance of their lives. And they came\nout men mentally and physically.\nAnd from now on these men will be\nrespected and assisted to an even\ngreater extent than has been the rule\nheretofore.\nBranches of Service\nFollowing are some of the branches\nof the army for which men are wanted\ntogether with the requirements of\neach:\nThe infantry, the largest fighting\narm, which demands youngsters of\nnerve and offers rapid advancement.\nThe cavalry, which calls for men of\nequal courage and knowledge for in\nterest in horses.\nThe artillery, which of necessity de\nvelops men of the highest type. Men\nare wanted for both field and coast\nservice.\nThe engineers, which converts\ngreen men into experienced civil engi\nneers, fitting them for the most dif\nficult work.\nThe medical department, which\nSTOCKS ARE\nSIB\nEXTREME WEAKNESS OF FOR\nEIGN EXCHANGE DEMORAL\nIZE THE MARKET\n(Associated Press)\nNew York, Feb. 4.

Now let the\npeople do their part in upholding the\nlaw and helping the officials to en\nforce it.\nMoonshining, a nuisance, has be\ncome a menace.\nBut it can remain a menace only by\nthe supineness and cowardice of the\npeople.\nMost of our citizens are opposed to\nthe traffic and despise the men that\ncarry it .on. \' But they have allowed it\nto go on, not because they lack the\ncourage to take strong measures\nagainst it, but because they have been\ntoo selfish to take the trouble to help\nsuppress it.\nNearly all the moonshine in the\ncounty is made out in the country and\nbrought into town. There is no pre\ncinct in the county where liquor can\nbe made if law-abiding citizens re\nsolve that it shall not be. \'\nIt is their duty as citizens tOiSO\nresolve.\' It is their duty not only to\ntheir county but to their neighbors\nand themselves. They know not what\nhour the traffic may bring irreparable\nharm upon them or upon a friend.\nLet all good citizens give aid to the\nofficers in this matter. Let them aid\nthe law as they would aid it in punish\ning murder and theft, forx of a truth\nit leads to both. As long as illicit\nliquor circulates in a community, no\nman\'s life is safe, nor is his property,\nand what is more, the women and girls\nare not safe, for of all human fiends\nthe worst is the man with his pas\nsions inflamed and added to by the\nfluid that oozes from the moonshine\nstill.\nSCHOLARS AS WELL AS SEAMEN\nCapt. Walter Gordon Roper, U. S.\nN.. is in the city, looking after re\nfor the navv. Capt. Roner is\n\' recruiting inspector for the south\neastern division with headquarters in\nAtlanta. He is a cousin of Daniel C\nRoper, United States commissioner of\ninternal revenue, and bears a strong\nresemblance to his distinguished rel\native.\nCant. Roner visited the Star Tues-\nday night and talked interestingly on\nthe subject of naval training. There\nis the greatest difference in the world\nA\nbetween the training given to seamen\ntoday and a quarter of a century ago\nThe navy was always a good calling\nand a good school. But in former days\nthe idea was, once a sailor, always a\nsailor. A boy or young man who en-\n. nstea, at xne enu ui ma mow cnav\nment found himself, however good a\nseaman, rather helpless on land. And\nno matter how many enlistments he\nserved, it was the same. True, he was\nalways certain of his place in the\nnavy, and care in his old age. But if\ni. ,i 11 1 a 4- 4-Vt\n;an"ien me sea, ne nau w ucgui\nbottom in business, even if he had\ntwenty years\' training aboard ship.\nNowadays, the navy takes the boy or\nyoung man of eighteen years or older\nand helps to make him a gooa cixizen,\ngood mechanic or business man while\nit makes him an able seaman. There\nare two score or more of trades in the\nnavy, the knowledge of any of which\nmakes a man valuable on land. Then\nalso the young sailor can finish his\neducation. He can come out of the\ngrammar school or high school or even\ncollege, and take special lessons on\nthe most useful subjects, especially\nli\'tiuieiiiaucs, a uioruujju uauimg m\nwhich is indispensable in civil life.\nMeantime he is paid a good salary,\nwhich with his "board and clothes,"\nhis doctor\'s bills paid, and other\nthings he would have to pay for him\nself in civil life, make him better off\nthan the average young man in a\ntrade or business ashore. If at the\nend of his first enlistment, he wants\nto remain in the navy, he is sure of\npromotion; if he wants to go back on\nland, he is well equipped to do so. On\naccount of its educational features,\nand creating a larger force of trained\nseamen, the navy prefers to give the\naverage yoxrng man one enlistment to\nstart him off in life, knowing it can\nalways call on him when he is needed,\nand keeping in service those who show\na decided preference for sea life.\n, .. Capt. Roper says that boys and\nyoung men from the farms and small\ntowns make the best sort of seamen.\nWhen they go aboard ship, they know\n\' nothing about sea life, but are almost\nalways very eager to learn, and eat up\ninstruction like it was cake and candy.\nAmerican boys are different in this\nfrom those of other nations, it being\nnoticeable that seamen recruited from\nthe interior of any European country\nwere always slo wtd learn at sea.\nCapt. Roper will be in Ocala today\nand part of tomorrow. He is a most\npleasant gentleman to meet and our\npeople dre glad of his visit.\nMARION COUNTY AT\nTHE TAMPA FAIR\nWe are glad to be able to report\nthat Marion county will be well rep\nresented at the South Florida Fair.\nThe county commissioners do not\nfeel able to appropriate money for\nthe purpose, but County Agent fees-\nscms and Mr. J. C. Howell have both\nbeen busy the last few weeks prepar\ning for this event. Both are veterans\nin the business, and Mr. Sessoms is\nparticularly well acquaitned with the\nmen in charge of Tampa\'s big exposi\ntion.\nMr. Howell reports to the Star as\nfollows:\nThe Rogers-Wilson Realty Co. will\nmake a county exhibit, which will be\na concentrated fair in itself, a sort of\nskimming off the cream of the best.\nThe Anthony Farms, Willard Blood,\nMr. Reiff of Lowell and probably Mr.\nHerlong will send blooded stock to\nTampa. They stand a mighty good\nchance to win on cattle and hogs.\nWhile the county\'s exhibit will not\nbe so great as that of some others, it\nwill be of the best quality and will at\ntract favorable attention to Marion.\nMARION SHOULDN\'T\nSTAY OFF THE MAP\nCapt. H. C. F. Dohm, of the Na\ntional Guard of Florida, who was here\na few weeks ago with Adjutant Gen\neral Catts, stopped in the city Satur\nday night on his return from a re\ncruiting trip thru the state. He reports\ngood progress being made in reorgan\nizing the state troops, despite the\npresent uncertainty regarding the\nstatus of the guardsmen. He says,\nhowever, there is one matter estab\nlished, and that is that the national\nguard is now under control of the\ngovernment and not subject to being\ncalled out at any moment by the gov\nernor of a state as it once was.\nHe reports the following progress\nin the work.\nBrooksville: Machine gun platoon to\nbe mustered in Friday of this week.\nStarke: Full company of 100 to be\nmustered in Monday, Feb. 9th.\nLive Oak: Full company to follow\nthe next week, then Lake City, St. Pe\ntersburg, Clearwater, Tarpon Springs,\nin the order named.\nWork is progressing in a most sat\nisfatcory way, with every indication\nthat the regiment will be completed\nby July 1st or even sooner. Several\ninfantry units are still open, also a\nsupply company and the headquarters\ncompany.\nThe present units are, in the order\nnamed: Daytona, Miami, Live .Oak,\nStarke, Brooksville, Marianna, Lake\nCity, St. Petersburg, Tarpon Springs\nand Clearwater, with other towns in\nthe state waiting for preliminary\nwork.\nIt looks to the Star like our county\nis in danger of being left off the mil\nitary- map, and this, considering its\npast splendid reputation, it can\'t af\nford to do. The machine gun idea\nhssn\'t seemed to take, but we have\nover five hundred of the best infantry\nsoldiers in the world. Can\'t we as\nsemble a hundred of them to hold old\nMarion\'s end up?\nHarmless Superstitions.\nEverybody Is superstitious and gen\nerally our superstitions are trivial and\ndo no harm. To carry a \'coin in the\npocket for luck; to comment about\nseeing the moon over the left shoul\nder, to refuse to walk under a ladder ;\nto believe that it Is bad luck to turn\nback; to make a wish at the appear\nance of the first star of the evening:\nto suppose It Is not well to break a\nmirror, which it Isn\'t well to do. But\nthe point Is, everybody is superstitious,\nregardless of what he says about it.\nHe may not really know that he is su\nperstitious; he may be honest in be\nlieving that he is not. But the fact\nremains that superstition was bred\nInto the race away back in the jungle,\nwhere little was understood, where\nImportance was attached to the shape\nof the clouds, where trees and stones\nand mountains and rivers had a per\nsonality and we can\'t get it out of\nthe system.\nAn All-Nations Case.\nJohn Pappas, a Greek, has been ar\nrested on a charge of grand larceny.\nHabld Helde, a Turk, makes the ac\ncusation.\' Helde had some Russian\nmoney, how much he doesn\'t know. He\nexchanged It for 100 English sover\neigns. An Italian friend introduced\nhim to Pappas, the Greek. A trip\nthrough the Botanical gardens was un\ndertaken. During the walk a man who\nlooked like a Swede and who talked\nlike a Swede appeared and assumed\nthe role of hold-up man. Pappas\ndidn\'t help, said the Turk. Detective\nHagerty, an Irishman, arrested the\nGreek. The preliminary hearing was\nheld next morning before a magis\ntrate who was born In Wales. New\nYork Times.\nCuba Starts War on Rats.\nThe Cuban sanitation authorities\nhave undertaken a vigorous campaign\nagainst the rat pest to prevent the\nbubonic plague from enterii;? Cuba.\nThousands of traps have been set\nand every precaution is being taken.\nShips coming from port? under sus\npicion will not be permitted to unload\nat the wharves, but must discharge\ntheir cargoes by means of lighters or\nlaunches while anchored In the har\nbor, thereby lessening the possibility\nof plague-carrying rats reaching shore.\nAshes Make Good Fertilizers:\nThe technical authorities for the res\ntoration of France and Belgium an\nnounce that they have discovered that\nfurnace ashes from glass, iron and\nsteel works stimulate vegetable prowl n\nenormously through carbonic n :d ft v\ntllization. All plant life is aid to be\nspurred to unusual growth. Theso n-h\nes may be applied to restoration of thf\ndevastated districts.\nUse the Star\'s Unclassified Column.\nOF THE GREATEST\nPUBLIC INTEREST\nThe army recruiting detachment\nwill give the following display tomor\nrow.

Ho Spencer\nW. IL PedricZ\nNew York. Americans who contem\nplate visiting the battlefields In Eu\nrope next spring or summer will be\nwell advised to secure their hotel ac\ncommodation well in advance or to\npostpone their journey until conditions\nare more favorable. Percy S. Bullen,\ntreasurer of the Association of For\neign Press Representatives in the Uni\nted States, who has just returned to\nNew York, says that London even now\ncannot find room for visitors and that\nthe stute of affairs when the floodgates\nof tourist Invasion are again open will\nbe appalling unless the intending\nAmerican visitors are forewarned and\ntherefore forearmed.\nIt is estimated that some 2,000,000\npersons one for each man sent to\nEurope by the United States during\nthe war are making plans for a\ntransatlantic trip in the next two\nyears. Their chief object Is to see\nthe historic spots where the American\nsoldiers fought the Argonne forest,\nChateau-Thierry, St. Mihiel and to\ndevote such a period to a visit to Eng\nland as time and funds will permit.\nMr. liullen has been all over the\nwestern front during the last few\nweeks and he predicts nothing but\nanger, 4rritatiou and despair as the\nlot of uny visitors who trust to luck\nto secure hotel accommodations.\nNo Steps Yet Taken.\nThe difficulty of the situation will\nbe rwillzed when it is remembered\nthat the usual now of tourists to\nEuroi-e has been completely suspend-\nd during the war and that only those\namong the wealthiest will have the\nfirst chance of securing hotel accom\nmodation when the bars against tour\nist travel shall have been removed.\nSo far no steps whatsoever have\nbeen taken abroad to meet an unusual\ninflux of visitors. Mr. Bullen was so\ninprsed with the difficulty threat\nened In London that he prepared it\nmemorandum on the subject, which he\nsubmitted at a recent meeting of the\nlloyU Colonial Institute in London. In\nthe discussion which ensued It was\nproposed that steps be taken for the\nformation in London of a national\n. :ni!:iittee of reception. As a nucleus\nf ;he organization it was proposed\nthat representatives of the various\nMiy-o-Amerlcaii societies should meet,\nwith power to add to their number\nv:!,-;nus representatives whose experi\nence would be useful in solving the\npro It\'in now presented. Such persons\nwo.ihl include members of the Ameri\ncan Chamber of Commerce in London\nami other Americans, besides leading\nBritishers.\nPlan Suggested.\nThe first essential step Is to mo\nbilize and list all available accommo\ndation provided by hotels and board\ning houses, and then enlist the assist\nance of every householder willing to\nplace a room at the disposal of the\ncommittee of reception. If this plan\nmatures London will keep in touch\n.. i:h New Y\'ork on the question of ac\ncommodations and people in the Uni\nted States will be advised as to the\n.best time to travel and the chances of\nsecuring accommodation at reasonable\nrates. At the time Mr. Bullen left Liv\nerpool nothing actually had been done\nexcept to call attention to the prob\nlem and the dissatisfaction which will\nensu it American visitors to England\nand Trance next year find themselves\nabsolutely stranded, as is threatened.\nBelgium Is apparently well able to\ntake care of visitors to the Belgian\nbattlefields, mainly because Ypres,\nDixmude and the much battered coast\ntowns are all within easy range of\nOstend, Bruges tand Ghent. Of all the\nbattlefields visited, Mr. Bullen de\nclares Ypres is the "most devastated,"\nbut, with Its memories of heroic fight\ning extending from Ypres down the\nMennen and Poelcappelle roads, "is\nbeautiful In Its ruins." Ostend Is\nprobably the best center for automo\nbile parties, and the burgomaster of\nOstend Is one of the few men prepar\ning to deal with an unexampled de\nmand for hotel accommodations.\nTHE OCALA GAS ENGINE WORMS\nLocal Agents for the Old Reliable\nUICM AUT4D\nAnnounces that they are now Handling Storage Batteries and\nmaintain a fully equiped service station for recharging batteries.\nComplete line of GOODYEAR and UNITED STATES Tires and\nTubes.
