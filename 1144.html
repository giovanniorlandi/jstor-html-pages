COLORADO.\nThere are more than 1,000,000 square\nfeet of glass surface in England ex\nclusively devoted to the cultivation and\nproduction of tomatoes for market pur\nposes.\nAmong the figures returned for\ncities from the Italian census taken on\nFebruary 9 are Rome, 502,000; Flor\nence, 190,000; Venice, 151,000, and Bo\nlogna, 152,000.\nThe quick firing artillery with which\nthe whole Swiss army is to be equipped\nforthwith, consists of nickel steel guns,\n7.4 centimeters caliber, firing ten shots\na minute, with a range of 5,800 yards.\nIt does not appear that the English\nare ready to withdraw from South\nAfrica. British agents are in this\ncountry asking bids on 20,000,000 bags\nof feeding oats, 20,000,000 bags of seed\noats, 20,000,000 bales of alfalfa hay and\n20,000,000 bags of bran. It is under\nstood jhat these supplies are for the\ntroops in South Africa.\nHere is the latest story of Judge\nHenry E. Howland, one of the most\npopular after-dinner speakers of New\nYork: “There was a little boy who\nwas badly puzzled over the theory of\nevolution. He went to his mother and\nasked: ‘Mamma, am I descended from\na monkey?’ ‘I don\'t know,’ she an\nswered; ‘I never met any of your fa\nther’s people.’ ”\nPreliminary reports of the Austrian\ncensus taken on December 31 last, give\nthe population of Austria as 26,107,304\nand that of Hungary as 19,203,531. The\ntotal population of the empire, includ\ning Bosnia and Herzegovina, is prob\nably about 47,000,000, an increase of a\nlittle over 9 per cent, since 1890. The\npopulation of Vienna is 1,635,647 and\nthat of Budapest 729,383.\nThe Archduke Rainer of Austria has\npresented his magnificent collection of\npapyri, which is one of the finest in\nthe world, to the Hofbibliothek at\nVienna. This splendid gift consists of\n70,000 Greek, 30,000 Arabic, and 5,000\nCoptio manuscripts, all of which have\nbeen catalogued during the last 15\nyears by Professor Karabacek, who\nhas just been appointed director of the\nVienna Hofbibliothek.\nWhat are the two changes in the per\nsonal appearance of people which\nwould most surprise a Rip Van Winkle,\nopening his eyes after a sleep of a cen\ntury? According to a recent observer,\nthey would be the number of persons\n—young and old—who were wearing\nglasses, and the few of any age who\nwere pitted with smallpox. A very\nagreeable exchange. Perhaps another\ncentury will teach man how to re\ncover normal eyesight, as well as to\nsave the smoothness of his skin.\nThe deepest hole in France is a well\nin the coal mines of Ronchamp, Up\nper Seine, which was completed in De\ncember, 1900. Its depth is 3,600 feet\nand Its utilizable diameter is 13 feet.\nThe shaft is walled from top to bottom\nand lined with copper where it tra\nverses water-bearing strata. To com\nplete it sixty months were required.\nAt 30 feet below the surface the tem\nperature of the rock is 50 degrees Fah\nrenheit; at the bottom the tempera\nture is 117 degrees Fahrenheit, al\nthough the highest temperature of the\nair in the shaft (without artificial ven\ntilation) is 88 degrees.\nThe municipal council of Venice has\noffered a reward of 20,000 lire to any\nperson who may rescue Lieut. Count\nFranco Quirini and the Norwegian\nsailor, who were lost from the explor\ning party of the Duke of Abruzzi. A\nreward of 5,000 lire is offered to any\none who furnishes definite news of\nthe fate of the men. Only a few days\nago an expedition started for Franz-\nJosef Land, for the purpose of finding\nthe lost adventurers. They may be\ndiscovered, but the chances are against\nIt. The remarkable experience of Nan\nsen and his companion in that region\naffords some hope that the Italian and\nthe Norwegian are still safe.\nAristocrat and plebeian are only\ncomparative terms. Some years ago\nProfessor Geddes of Edinburg moved\nhis family into a slum .district, where\nthey hoped to do friendly work among\nthe poor. One evening he asked a dis\ntinguished statesman to dine with two\nlocal guests, a chimney-sweep and a\nscavenger. The statesman accepted\nwith unfeigned pleasure, the scavenger\nsaid he would come; but the chimney\nsweep refused to-sit down with the\nscavenger. At another time the fam\nily on the first floor of the decrepit\ntenement they inhabited told Professor\nGeddes that if he continued to speak\nto the family in the garret he must\ndrop their acquaintance. "If the an\ngels have any fun in them,” wrote\nHorace Walpole, “how our distinctions\nmust divert them!”\nThe bursting forth of a new spring\n•t Carlsbad, throwing out eight hun\ndred gallons a minutcrat a temperature\nof 162 Fahr., is a remarkable event.\nWar 900 years the waters of Carlsbad\nfcave run with, so far as is known, only\n. W intermission, occurred for\nthree days at the time of the great Lis\n‘ bon earthquake. The temperature of\n* \' the new spring shows that its waters\n;.i same from what is locally known as\n. the Sprudelkesael, or “foaming cald\nron,” which Is believed to underlie\ni. Oxrtobad, and to supply its seventeen\nhat springs.\n™ SPIRIT »\nCHANGE\n1 The calm stars looking on men see all \\\n!

Co.)\n“Shall you marry him, Leslie?”\n“It’s manners to wait to be asked,”\nreturned Leslie.\n“Hasn’t he asked you?” persisted\nWill Cable.\n“That would be telling,”, Leslie\nMarsh replied.\nThen she laughed up at the young\ngiant leaning over the high back of a\ncolonial chair and regarding her with\na look at once quizzical and puzzled.\nHe was just as gentle, as retiring, as\nshy as ever. And yet the world had\ngreat things to say of his wisdom, his\nindomitable pluck in the face of dis\ntressing obstacles, the lofty scientific\nvalue of his researches and discover\nies. He had been Interviewed and\nlauded. The critics were unanimous\nIn his praise. And here he was, back\nIn the beloved, book-lined old room\nwhere they had quarreled as children\n—just the same delightful fellow of\nfive years before.\n“I suppose you know we’re awfully\nproud of you, Will,” she said. She\nhad been watching him dreamily, try-,\nIng to fancy that powerful, cropped,\ndark head adorned with the soft waves\nof the lad who used to be so careful\nof his personal appearance when he\nwas home from college on his vaca\ntions. “I keep telling people what\ngreat friends we were when we were\nyoung. I don’t say a word about the\ntorture you made me suffer when you\nkidnaped my doll.”\n“You may not happen to remember\neither, your revenge for that injury!”\n“Oh, I do!” she cried, and laughed\nout. “Indeed I do! You were taking\nMr. Raymore, bland and placid.\nLaura Miller to play tennis, and Bob\nby ”\n"I have always thought the sense\nof humor in your small brother was\nInspired and developed by his sister.\nTo accidentally turn the garden hose\non a young man clad In the height of\nfashion, was a peculiar evidence of mis\ndirected energy! Now, what are\nyou- ”\nCarriage wheels had stopped before\nthe door. They could hear the servant\ncrossing the hall. "Mr. Reginald Ray\nmoft,” namintid the man.\nMr. Raymon, bland and placid,\nround-faced, round-eyed, hat in hand\nand monocle in eye, made his appear\nance. Was he too early? Was Miss\nMarsh ready? He had been assured\nthe first act was unusually strong.\nMr. ; ah, yes, Mr. Cable, to be\nsure! He had heard of Mr. Cable.\nQuite pleased to meet him! Was this\nMiss Marsh’s cloak? Would she per-\n"Whenever you will take me.”\nmit him? Good evening, Mr. Cable!\nThen Miss Marsh had taken up her\nbouquet, had gathered around her the\nfolds of her opera wrap of old-rose\npanne velvet, had sent a sweet, swift,\nmocking look at Cable standing desert\ned —and was gone.\nBut, although she heartily enjoyed\nthe gay comedy to which they went,\nshe had no faintest idea of the comedy\nin which she played a wholly uncon\nscious part. How could she dream that\nReginald Raymon had finally decided\nto bestow upon her the inestimable\nhonor of his favor?\nHe was making no rash decision.\nHe repeatedly strengthened his heart\nby this reassurance while they drove\nto the theatre, while he sat by her side\nat the play—was her vis-a-vis at sup\nper. Her family was one of not only\nsocial but intellectual pre-eminence.\nHer father had been twice senator from\nhis state. Her brother had held a high\ndiplomatic post abroad. Their friends\nwere of the most exclusive. Their ac\nquaintances were those of the cultured\n—the artistic world. To be sure,’ the\nMarshes had no money to spare. But—\nwhat was money to him? And w\'hen it\ncame to grace, and wit, and distinc\ntion, and beauty, and abov6 all, that\nexquisite, indefinable possession we call\nbreeding—there was not a girl in the\nstate who might be mentioned in the\nsame breath with her—no, by George!\nnot one! And be would marry her—\nhe woul* t He’d tell her so this very\nnight.\nHe turned to study her again—*and\nwith pulses that quickened as he look\ned. Faultless of form, graceful as only\na beautiful woman and a tigress can\nbe—with features perfect as those cut\non the silver coins of Syracuse, she\nwas worth the incense of men’s hom\nage-worthy the quite as precious glory\nof woman’s Jealousy! There was Just\na glimpse of creamy flesh through the\nmeshes of Mechlin at arms rad bosom.\nThe eyes that looked out from under\nlong, white lids had the laughing love\nliness of a child\'s. One fancied the\nfull scarlet lips could be as scornful as\nthey were sensitive —as passionate as\nthey were sweet.

Yes, he\nwas making a perfectly proper choice.\nWould she be overwhelmed to be se\nlected as the bride of a millionaire?\nTo have a palace at Newport, a town\nhouse in London? There was a charm\ning old mansion on a blue Scottish\nmoor he would buy for her if she fan\ncied a sojourn in the land of the\nheather. As for jewels—he smiled\nagain there. All women loved jewels.\nHow many men could offer to the\nchosen companion of his life such rare\ngems as he?\nBut, while he found himself, the en\nvied of all men, sailing beside her\ndown the Adriatic —he had almost\nfixed on the Adriatic for their wed\nding trip—he used his language as the\nsapient Frenchman divined —to con\nceal his thoughts.\n‘‘That Mr. Cable seems a fine sort\nof a fellow.

"He\nought to be very much flattered!”\nA queer little look flashed at him\nfrom under the curling dark lashes.\n“It is we who are flattered, Mr. Ray\nmon!”\nHis laugh was leniency itself.\n“The extent of your charity is only\nbeing revealed to me!

What could the gods give you\nthat you have not?”\nHe was conscious of the tremor that\nwent through the slight frame. A\nsense of his supremacy shook him. He\nhad been right then! All his golden\nanticipations were to be realized. Not\nthat he had doubted for a moment\nthat any girl In her right mind would\nrefuse him—Reginald Raymon! His\narm slipped confidently around her\nwaist.\n"The gods could give me nothing—\nunless you were theirs to give!”\n"Ah!” she said softly. She moved a\nlittle until she was free from his arm.\n“You —you are quite sure —”\nThat was just where Raymon’s had\nquarter of an hour began.\n“Sure—indeed, yes! I have not spok*\nen hastily. I have given the matter—\na weighty one as you will admit—due\nconsideration.” He adjusted his\nmonocle. He wished the coachman\nwould drive more slowly. “I recollect\nof what I owe to my family, to my\nposition, to—if I may say so —to my\nself!”\n“Yes,” sighed a tender voice, “Oh—\nyes!”\n“And I have made up my mind that\nyou are the only woman I shall marry\n—you!”\nHe could feel again the tremor of\nthe slender shape near. He put out\na fat little hand. His touch was not\nteniative by any means. It was de\ntermined. There was no false mod\nesty about Raymon. In the gloom of\nthe carriage he almost forgot tue\ncharm, the beauty, the power of the\ngirl.

The kite fever in\nthe island das been on for three\nmonths, and it bids fair to last for a\nmuch longer time. It began at Christ\nmas. Luckily for the boys few of the\ntowns and villages have telegraph or\ntelephone wires to molest the aerial\ntoys, and it is observed that in such\ncities as San Juan and Ponce, where\nthe telegraph wires are numerous, the\nboys have not indulged in the kite\nflying excitement. But in Yauco and\nother mountain towns the young Por\nto Rican spends every moment of his\nnoon hour between school periods in\nhoisting the airy plaything. It is the\nbest sport the Porto Rican knows, for\nSOME PORTO RIOAN KITES.\nball playing has not been introduced\nin the island.\nThe Porto Rican boy shows a great\ndeal of originality in making these\n“volentines,” as he calls them. Not\nonly are new shapes continually ap\npearing, but the variety of colors us*d\nlends additional beauty to them. The\nmaterials from which they are made\nare colored paper, colored cloth and\nlight bamboo sticks tied with cord.\nThe cord is much heavier than that\nused by boys in the United States for\nthe same purpose, for the strong\nbreezes in Porto Rico would soon snap\nthe string that is used here. However,\nthe main reason for using the heavy\ncord is that the boys know nothing of\nour pretty white cotton cord.\nMuslin or paper is the covering for\nthe kites, which are of all shapes,\nsizes and colors. The smaller boys\nhave little squares of paper with the\nopposite corners folded over and fast\nened at the center for their kites. Old\ner boys have the real kites, made to\nfly high. These are usually decorated\nwith different colored flaps to flatter\nIn the wind. Some kites have the\nform of a cross, others of a bird,\nothers are in the shape of a triangle,\nin red, white and blue. The most com\nmon form is the six-sided kite, with all\nkinds of colored flaps. Often the boys\nput their names on their toys, and\nthese can be read for long distances.\n—W. W.

The veteran at the time was the\nguest of officers at Fort Fillmore, long\nsince abandoned. The Philadelphian,\nE. J. White, arrived at the post in an\nambulance, with his wife and child\nand two servants, a man and his wife.\nMr. White had been appointed at\nWashington as sutler for the military\npost of Fort Buchanan, several days\ndistant from Fillmore. White had\nnever been in the Indian country and\nlaughed at the fears of the people at\nthe fort, who warned him of danger\nfrom an attack of prowling Apaches.\nHe said he could not wait for a strong\ner party to come along and would start\nfor his destination the next day. Mrs.\nWhite was a beautiful young woman\nof one of the eastern cities, who had\nnever left her father’s roof until she\nstarted with her husband for the wilds\nof the mountains. The ambulance\nleft the next morning. “At daybreak\non the morning after that,” says the\nveteran, ‘‘we were aroused by the\nrapid beating of the drum. Two men\nhad arrived at the post from the west.\nThey said that about twenty miles\nfrom the post they came across the\ndead bodies of two men and the frag\nments of a wagon which had been set\non fire. Evidently there had been an\nattack by the Indians and the travel\ners had been taken by surprise. Im\nmediately a large party was organ\nized and we started for the spot, well\narmed and mounted on the fleetest\nhorses at the post. We had at our\nhead two of the most noted scouts of\nthe southwest. They rode forward\nwithout a word. We arrived at the\nscene of the massacre in about two\nhours, and found that the story was\ntoo true. No traces of Mrs. White or\nher babe could be found, and we knew\nshe had been carried off a prisoner to\na fate worse than death. We hastily\nburied the two men and started on the\ntrail of the savages. The trail led to\nward the Florida mountains, which ex\ntend into Chihuahua, Mexico, and we\nknew a long chase was before us, with\npoor chances of ever coming up with\nthe Indians. There* were fifteen Indi\nans in the party, as our guides found\n“TICKET\nNO GOOD”\nThe army woman, who has been\nmarried 10 years and moved 13 times,\ntold an experience the other evening\nwhich was appreciated by many who\nwere present. She was talking about\nChinese servants, who, by the way,\nare much like monkeys or parrots, im\nitative, but not original. She said:\n‘‘Now, there was Sam! That al\nmond-eyed fellow could cook for ‘fur\nther orders’ and he was willing and\nindustrious, but he simply would not\nwait on the door! Honestly, Sam\nseemed to have been suddenly stricken\ndeaf, dumb and blind every time the\nbell rang. Well, you know how things\nare in these army posts. The servant\nis obliged to do all the work; so I\nmade up my mind if that Chinaman\ncould be taught I’d teach him. I put\nhim into the awkward squad and pro\nceeded to drill him. I went to the\ndoor, rang the bell and had Sam re\nspond. Then I told him how to open\nthe door; to make a*low bow; to hold\nout the salver for the cards—I used my\nown, of course—and to show people\nBonus for Those\nWho Marry\nA society whose undertaking is to\nprovide a bonus for those who marry\nis tending to make life in East St.\nLouis more interesting and also to en\ncourage habits of thrift in those who\nenter into an obligation to pay the\nbonus, says the Globe-Democrat. The\nfirst man to become a beneficiary of\nthe association drew $500 the other\nday, and is convinced that the objects\nfor which the society is formed are ex\ntraordinarily excellent, and, in fact,\nis not backward in the use of much\nmore commendatory language, such as\nis commensurate with a gift of $500.\nA wise and useful provision in the in\nstrument under which the association\nis organized makes it necessary for\nthose who marry to wait for two years\nbefore they are given the $500. It\nwill be seen that while this encourages\nPigs as Life-Savers.\nLife-savers are not confined by any\nmeans to the ranks of the human fam\nily. There are many instances of dogs\nrescuing people and horses and some\nothers of the higher orders of animals\nhave been credited with saving lives.\nA recent incident in the far east places\npigs in this noble role. The Australian\ncoasting steamer Kameruka, while go\ning from Eden to Sydney, traveling at\nfull speed, struck on a reef at Moruya\nHead. There being no rockets on the\nship, the captain tied a life line to\nsome pigs, which formed part of the\ncargo, and had the animals put over\nboard. The pigs swam to the shore,\ntaking the line with them, and by es\ntablishing communication every soul\non board was rescued.\nDhiflnvarj of Colonist Rellos.\nTh* sifting of a lot of waste paper\nI STORY OF APACHE\nCRUELTY IN THE\nWEST.\nby counting the tracks of their horses.\nWe rode at the height of speed all\nday; not stopping for food or rest. In\nthe evening we entered a valley that\nextended farther than the eye cou\'.d\nreach to the southward. It was a\nbright moonlight night, and all night\nwe rode through the valley. The\nweaker horses gave out, but the main\nbody pushed on, stopping only to water\nthe horses at a mountain stream and\nsnatch a quick lunch from a small\nstore with which we were supplied. It\nwas the longest and hardest ride I\never knew, and yet we seemed far be\nhind the fleeing savages. At daylight\nwe reached a stream of water and\nthere the quick eye of our scouts dis\ncovered the dead body of Mrs. White s\nbabe. The babe had been killed by\nthe Indians out of wanton cruelty. At\nthe spring our guides decided that we\nshould rest while they pushed cau\ntiously ahead without any attendants.\nThey believed the Indians would be\nfound in camp along the valley, and\nthe approach must be with the great\nest caution. We waited for hours. Our\npatience was sorely tried, but in the\nevening we had a chance at the sav\nages. The party of which I was a\nmember was lying in the rocks, with\nthe camp of the Indians directly before\nus, and each man had singled out his\nsavage. The Indians were stretched\non the ground around a smouldering\nfire, and they paid no attention what\never to our whippoorwill’s cry. We\nopened fire from both sides of the\ncamp at the same instant, and then\nrushed forward. Seven of the Indians\nlay dead. Several of the sleeping form?\nleaped to their feet and disappeared\nin the shadow of the trees. Upon ar\nriving at the camp we found to our\nsorrow that Mrs. White was dead. One\nof the fleeing demons had stabbed her\nto the heart, and her servant, was\ntreated in the same inhuman manner.\nBoth bodies were warm, but the sav\nages had accomplished all the harm\npossible, and several of t.he Indians\nescaped entirely. We buried the bodies\nin the shadow of the mountains, and\nout of reach of wolves and. coyotes, but\nour hearts were sad as we returned to\nthe fort. A year later a watch case\nwith the initials ‘‘E.

Of course, it might be worth\nmore money for some to fulfill these\nrequirements than others, but this\ncould be overcome by a board of equal\nization. After a careful study of the\nsituation the society might offer great\ner inducements to those who seemed\nto be entitled to them.

Doviner, Congressman\nfrom West Virginia, in a letter from\nWashington, D. C., to The Peruna Med*\niclne Co., says the following of their\ncatarrh remedy, Peruna:\n“I join with my colleagues In the\nHouse of Representatives in recom\nmending your excellent remedy, Pe\nruna, as a good tonic and also an ef\nfective cure for catarrh.”\nMrs. Mary C. Fentress writes from\nParadise, Tex., the following: “I\nthink I can say that your good advice\nand medicine has cured me of chronic\ncatarrh. I have had no pains in my\nhead since I have taken Peruna. I\nhave been in bad health ever since\n\'59, and have taken a good many med\nicines which were only of temporary\nrelief. Peruna is the catarrh cure. The\nPeruna stopped my catarrh of the head\nso that it did not become chronic, and\nI am very thankful for Dr. Hartman’s\nadvice and medicine.”\nPeruna is a specific for all catarrhal\ndiseases. It acts quickly and bene\nficially upon the inflamed mucous\nmembrane, thus removing the cause of\ncatarrh.\nCatarrh is catarrh wherever located.\nCatarrh is essentially the same every\nwhere. The remedy that will cure ca\ntarrh in one situation will cure it in\nall situations.\nIf you do not derive prompt and aat\nisfactory results from the use of Pe\nruna, write at once to Dr. Hartman,\ngiving a full statement of your case\nand he will be pleased to give you his\nvaluable advice gratis.\nAddress Dr. Hartman, President of\nThe Hartman Sanitarium, Columbus.

It is always\nworth $20.67 an ounce for an ounce of\nit is always itself the $20.67.\nIt is noticeable that there is a strong\ntendency among those who have spent\na few months in a print shop to get\nthe idea that they know all about the\nnewspaper office and understand what\nit costs to operate and do the work.\nYet we have known men who have\nworked all their lives at the business\nwho were able to learn a few things\n(about it. It, is a profession and is\npot to be learned in a year or two\nyears.\nThe result of the decision of the Un\nited States Supreme court, in the case\nof Calhoun M. Co. vs. the Ajax M.\nCo., is to finally establish the principle\nthat the ownership of all lodes op veins\napexing within a legally established\nmining claim belong to that claim\nirrespective as to whether they are\ncross or parallel veins. Between two\nconflicting locations the senior in time\ntakes all the veins apexing within the\nconflicting area.\nWhat is needed in most mining dis\ntricts is practical work and the apply\ning of ordinary business principles to\njhining operations. The Crystal river\ndistrict is no exception to the general\nrule in this pespect. If miners and\nmine owners would prosecute work and\nexpend their money upon their proper\nty in a business way, following mining\nas other men follow trades and other\npursuits, using the same judgment,\npaying as ipuch attention to the fin\nances, they would make mining a suc\ncess. If they would properly develop\ntheir mines, put upon the best ones the\nmoney which they annually throw away\nin working assessments all over the\ncountry, and would follow mining as\na business, there wop hi be no lack of\nmineral, no lack of employment for\nlaborers, no dull times ip winter, and\nthe Crystal river district would soon\nbecome what by right it ought to be\nand ultimately will be one of the\ngreatest mineral sections in Colorado.\nWith shallow surface developments\non a lode deposit it is rarely good\nJudgment to run a long costly tunnel\nto cut the lode at a great depth, says\nMin. and Scientific Press. The Mexi\ncan miner\'s way, though not pretty, is\ngenerally satisfactory in returns. His\npiethod is to follow the ore values with\nbis mine openings, turning his shaft\nor winze or tunnel as the ore body\nchanges its direction. With shallow\nsurface developments there is nothipg\ncertain on which to predicate the di\nrectiop or the continuity of an ore\nphoot developed by a surface cut or\nincline. It is much safer to\n£aiu depth by successive steps. Just\nbow lpuch at a time is a matter for\nJudgment in the particular case, but it\nis safe to say that 200 feet is ordinari\nly an outside figure for the first gain\n)q depth sought by a tunnel. As the\ndirection and continuity develop, great\ner depths may be taken by successive\ntunnels without increasing the chances\nagainst success. To tunnel to cut a\n)ode a thousand feet below surface i\nworks only fifty or so feet deep reads\nBiw. it l* not mining.\nSliver in the Orient.\nThe commercial position of the Un\nited States in the Orient incident to the\nI possession of the Philippines, should\nensure to the country, and particularly\nto the Pacific mining section of it, the\ncontrol of the world’s greatest silver\nconsuming market —the Chinese Em\npire. A step in the right direction to\nward this control is the establishment\nof a Manila branch of the United\nStates Mint. A second step, and one\ncertain to be made before long, will be\nthe establishment of United States\nbanking facilities in Manila and\nShanghai and more or less in other\nChinese cities. After these two steps,\nthe rest will follow naturally. From\nthe existence of causes or influences\nthu would seem to have no reasonable\nbusiness excuse for existence, steam\nship freight charges are less on silver\nshipped from, say, Germany, via the\nSuez Canal and around the south of\nAsia to Shanghai, a voyage of thirty\nfive days, than they are from San\nFrancisco across the Pacific to the\nsame place, a voyage of not more than\ntwenty days. The marine insurance of\nthe fcilver from Europe to Shanghai,\nthe longer time and proportionately\ngreater risk, is more than from San\nFrancisco to Shanghai, the shorter\ntimo and relatively less risk. The in\nterest loss for the elapsed time between\nshipment and delivery, which must be\nborne by the seller, would certainly be\nagainst the most distant supply point.\nExchange, always a factor in inter\nnational business, should now be fa\nvorable to the Pacific coast, or, at\nleast, not so greatly to its disadvant\nage as formerly.\nWith the branch mint and our bank\ning facilities at Manila, it would seem\nthat u depot for our silver product\ncould be established there, supplied\ndirectly from the silver-producing Pa\ncific coast states. It is assumed that\nthe. advantage of freight and insurance\ncharges could be secured to the ship\nment of silver across the Pacific, to\nwhich it logically belongs.\nSilver is the banking money metal\nof the Chinese. They understand, at\nleast the commercial classes do. the\nchanges of relative value measured in\ngold, still they use it to hoard their\nsurplus wealth accumulation and will\ndoubtless continue to for many years\nto come. They understand and are\nable to determine accurately the fine\nness of silver. In transactions among\nthemselves they discount any debase\nment of fineness of the pure metal, so\nthat only fine silver, 999 fine, should\nhe marketed to them. The large bars\nmade by our refineries they cannot use\nin transactions among themselves.\nThey remelt these and cast the silver\ninto rough cup-shaped forms weighing\nfrom one to three pounds, and these\npass from hand to hand by weight.\nSo far as known there is no prejudice\namong them as to shape, so that our\nrefineries could cast from the first\nmelting of the refined silver ‘\'bars”\nand “kings” of the small weights\nnoted. These saving the cost and loss\nof reraelting by the Chinese would have\nsome market value in excess of such\nlarge commercial bars as ar ; e now\nmade.\nAt the present time a very consider\nable proportion of the silver taken by\nthe Chinese passes through Hamburg,\nGermany. Manila is so much nearer\na supply base for the metal that it\nshould supply the market. The Chinese\nare close buyers. In their own ex\nchanges the price of silver changes\nfrom day to day, and the demand be\ntween the seasons, and they speculate\nin it just as our own people do in wheat\nand corn. They could hardly fail to\nayail themselves of the advantage of a\nsilver supply fewer days distant than\nthe alternative supply is weeks distant.\n—Mining and Scientific Press.\nTn 1880 the establishment of the elec\ntric industry in this country began to\nbe of some importance. Seventy-six\nfirms, employing 1271 persons, were\nthen established. Their output was\n$2,655,036. Ten years later the firms\nincreased to 189, and the number of\npersons employed to 9485, while the\noutppt was $19,114,714. In 1880 there\nwere only three stations in the United\nStatos, and only 230 persons were em\nployed at them. In 1890, in New York,\nthe District of Columbia and the city\nof St. Louis there were 144 electric\nlight and power stations, where 2000\npersons were employed, and the out\nput from them was valued at $4,783,224. ;\nFour years later, in 1804, there were\n2124 central stations in the country\nand 7475 separate plants. In 1900\nthere were 5000 central stations and ■\nover 15,000 separate plants.\nAn exchange remarks that a news\npaper man is blamed for a lot of\nthings that he cannot help, such as\nusing partiality in mentioning visitors,\ngiviug news about some folk-*, leaving\nothers out, etc. He simply prints the\nnews he can find.
