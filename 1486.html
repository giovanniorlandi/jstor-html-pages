Please credit the authors and the full source.\nIn this impressive work, Christian Lentz explores the ways in\nwhich the emergent Vietnamese territory was produced\nthrough social relations and deployed as a strategic form of\nrule in northwestern Vietnam. Drawing on years of detailed\nfieldwork and painstaking documentary research at the\nunderexplored National Archives of Vietnam, Lentz\nconstructs a new narrative of the events surrounding the\ndecisive moment in Vietnam’s struggle for independence\nfrom French colonial rule: the 1954 Battle of Diê.n Biên Ph .\nLentz shows how the leadership of the nascent\nDemocratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) constructed\nterritory as a means of rule by developing and deploying an\nimagined Vietnamese state territory (or what Thongchai\nWinichakul [1994] memorably called a ‘‘geobody’’) that did\nnot yet exist, nor was even certain would exist. Lentz follows\nthe threads of his argument through a sweeping\nchronological narrative, weaving together personal histories,\nofficial narratives, and, in fine-grained detail, documentary\nevidence produced by firsthand observers of the lead-up,\nclimax, and aftermath of the cataclysmic events at Diê.n Biên\nPh .\nHe begins in the midst of the tumultuous years at the\nclose of World War II, when European colonial hegemony in\nAsia had begun to crumble. The narrative takes us through\nthe subsequent rise of nationalist, anticolonial agitation, the\nresurgence of the Viê. t Minh forces, and the subsequent\nconsolidation of the DRV. He leads us through key events—\nthe Northwest Campaign in 1952, the Battle of Diê.n Biên\nPh in 1954, and its aftermath until 1960—as they unfolded\nacross the Black River region, a region then under the\nsemiautonomous Tai Federation (formerly, Sip Song Chau\nTai, ), an ethnically diverse principality in presentday\nnorthwestern Vietnam. Lentz focuses our attention on\nthe ways in which the emergent Vietnamese geobody was\nimagined and subsequently produced through relations of\ntrade and taxation (of rice, salt, opium, and other items) as\nwell as labor between upstream (Tai, Dao, Hmong, and\nKhmu) and downstream (Kinh) peoples, and how it was\ndeployed as a strategy of territorial rule.\nIn this book, we are presented with a fresh perspective\nthat problematizes the Vietnamese state’s glorious narrative\nof an uninterrupted ‘‘peoples war’’ of national liberation\nfounded on unquestionable solidarity and pluriethnic\nequality. Unlike many other treatments of this period, Lentz\nfocuses not so much on the martial elements of the struggles,\nbut rather on their largely unexamined subtext: the social\nrelations of power that supported and sought to legitimize\nsocialist restructuring of the mountainous frontier. Central\nto this story is the uneasy alliance between (Kinh) ideologue\nrevolutionaries and the local Tai nobility. While the Faustian\nbargain that was forged with the Tai nobility by the socialist\nrevolutionaries arguably enabled the stunning victory of the\nDRV in 1954, Lentz argues that, in its aftermath, it very\nnearly undid it. While socialist ideals of equality and\nliberation galvanized the rural peasantry and enlisted them\nin the revolutionary cause, the capitulation of the DRV to\nthe feudal Tai nobility reproduced historic inequalities and\nundermined promised land reforms. Exacerbated by\nrecurrent famine and ongoing taxation and labor\nconscription to feed and mobilize DRV forces, rural unrest\nin the years immediately following the ouster of the French\ngrew to a groundswell of antirevolutionary agitation as Dao,\nHmong, and Khmu minorities and the Tai peasantry\nresisted, sometimes violently, their incorporation into the\nVietnamese geobody.\nLentz’s work emerges from the intellectual soil of critical\ngeographers and scholars such as Benedict Anderson, Stuart\nElden, Michel Foucault, Nancy Peluso, James Scott,\nThongchai Winichakul, and others, but breathes new life\ninto this tradition in important ways. Grounding his analysis\nin ‘‘the everyday agrarian politics’’ (p 7) of peasants and the\nelite, he illustrates in striking clarity what terms like\n‘‘territorial imaginaries’’ actually look like in practical and\nmaterial terms. In so doing, he demonstrates why territory\ncannot simply be seen as a spatial container in which social\nand material processes play out, but it is also the product of\nthem. Territory thus becomes not a thing but rather a loose\ncollection of many ‘‘things’’—messy, negotiated,\ncontradictory, and contested. It is also a strategy in itself.\nThe imagined territories of both the elite and the subaltern\nare trotted out to serve specific (but not unitary) political\ngoals.\nContested Territory reminds us clearly of the mutability of\nthe state geobody. However tempting it is to project\nbackward in time the current boundaries of nation states\nonto their past, we risk running afoul of the reality that these\nadministrative entities are historically contingent social\nconstructs that are produced, negotiated, and malleable.\nThey are also permeable, closely intertwined with processes\nat scales above and below them. Lentz demonstrates the\nextent to which seemingly local events surrounding the\nBattle of Diê.n Biên Ph depended on very nonlocal material\nand political resources. For example, food resources from\nneighboring Laos and the game-changing weaponry—\nartillery manufactured in the United States, deployed in\nKorea, captured by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army,\nMountain Research and Development (MRD)\nAn international, peer-reviewed open access journal\npublished by the International Mountain Society (IMS)\nwww.mrd-journal.org\nMountainMedia\nM1Mountain Research and Development Vol 40 No 2 May 2020: M1–M2 https://doi.org/10.1659/mrd.mm252.1\n', 'and redeployed at Diê.n Biên Ph —that turned the tide of\nthe conflict. Conversely, the battle—waged in a Tai polity\nthat few outside the region had ever heard of—became a\nthunderclap that rattled the windows of Europe and\nAmerica, changing the course of modern history.\nLentz’s historic narrative has immediate relevance today.\nGoverning mountainous peripheries remains a core concern\nin ongoing processes of state formation in mainland\nSoutheast Asia (Peluso and Lund 2011; Dwyer et al 2016),\nCentral Asia (Goodhand 2008; Ingalls and Mansfield 2017),\nand many other areas (Korf and Raeymaekers 2013). Framing\nthese spaces as resource frontiers as well as places of poverty\nand insecurity provides both incentive and legitimacy for\nrendering them legible and obedient to state power. With\nglobalization, expanding investment and market systems\nprovide new tools and resources for drawing these\nmountainous marginal areas into the orbit of the state. At\nthe same time, however, accelerating flows of people and\nresources and the narrowing space-time gap between places\ncalls into question the significance and meaning of\ncontemporary geobodies. This all has far-reaching\nimplications for our understanding of sovereignty and\ncontrol over processes that are increasingly regional and\nglobal in nature.\nPolitical projects of territory-making are, of course, not\nlimited to terrestrial spaces. Territorial constructs like those\nstrategically deployed during Vietnam’s struggle for\nliberation are trotted out once more today on Vietnam’s\nseaward front. As China, Vietnam, and others seek to exert\ncontrol over the maritime region contentiously referred to\nas either the South China Sea (by China) or the East Sea (by\nVietnam)—in both cases with obvious geosymbolic import—\neach invoke an imagined territorial geobody to defend their\ncontested claims. Like the earlier Indochinese conflicts, this\nlocal territorial struggle risks spilling over into global\nconflict, involving not only regional powers but also the\nUnited States, Japan, and others.\nFor contemporary observers concerned with\ndevelopment and the political economy of former French\nIndochina, Lentz’s analysis of the triggers of\ncounterrevolutionary conflicts during the early DRV\nperiod—racially charged power inequalities and the\nrealpolitik approach to governing rural margins that\nproduced highly uneven risks and rewards—tells a\ncautionary tale. Today, the growing divide between wealthy,\nurban centers and rural peripheries bears a striking\nresemblance. If the events surrounding the Battle of Diê.n\nBiên Ph tell us anything, it is that unrest at the peripheries\nseldom stays there but, all too often, finds its way to the\ncenter.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nDwyer MB, Ingalls ML, Baird IG. 2016.
