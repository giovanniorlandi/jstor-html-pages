Atlantic Monthly.\nA LION HUNT.\nUsually Case In Which Hunters\nGoad the Game Into Combat.\nThere Is n distinction In Afrlcn be\ntween ordinary Hons nnd "mnn eat\ncrs." says T, It, MncMechen In Me\ndiae\'s Mngnxlne. The ordlnnry Hon\ndoc not willfully attack mail, The\npresence of Hons roaming nt night on\nthe veldt Is not disturbing to nny nn\ntlvo nor to whiles who have como to\nunderstand the bnnst. Persons return\nlug to their enmps nfter nightfall do\nnot notice the mating of Hons or the\ncries of Icopnrds or hyenns.\nIt Is seldom thnt people bout upon\ndomestic errnnds carry wenpons In the\ndarkness, although nt night the veldt\nof Mrlllsli Knst Afrlcn Is nllvo with\nroaming beasts, which tuny be hoard\nfrom the verandas of the houses,\nI.lons give the passing man n wide\nberth, dny or night, when It Is nppnr\nrut thnt he mentis no mischief. An\nordlnnry Hon, even when wounded.\nwill try flight before light. When Its\nescnpo Is dlsputrd It will, especially If\nwounded, try to maul Its enemy with\nteeth nnd claws.\nA Hon hunt Is usually n chase In\nwhich the hunters gnml the gnme Into\ncombnt. Once n Hon has tasted human\nblots), however, It Is no more afraid of\nmnn, but learns that he Is the wenk\nest of nnlmnls nnd the choicest of\nment. Hueh n Hon Is known ns n man\nenter because now he hunts man.\nReady Replies.\nOne of I.ord Carmarthen\'s future\nconstituents once asked the youthful\ncandidate his opinion upon some ab-\nNtruse question of which he knew\nnothing. "Let him alone!" cried an\nother derisively, "Don\'t you see he\'s\nnothing hut n baby?" "What do you\nthink?" reiterated tils Inquirer, heed\nless of the Interruption and deter\nmined to have an answer. "I think,"\nsaid Lord Carmarthen, with ready wit,\n"that It Is high time for all babies to\nbe In bed," nnd so saying he gathered\nup Ids papers nnd disappeared from\nthe platform,\nAgain -mid this Inst anecdote Is no\nwell known ns to have become well\nnigh hhitorlcni-nt it crowded meeting\nJust before his election, he wns Inter\nrupted by the question, "Does your\nmother know you\'re out?"
