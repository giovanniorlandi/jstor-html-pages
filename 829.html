RELATES\nINTERESTING STORY OF OLD\nTIMES.\nIn the language of the traveling\nsalesman Oxford is “looking up.”\n“Not looking up like it was two years\nago” to quote further our affable\nknight of the grip,” when the town\nwas flat of its back. You remember\nthen you had no lights and you were\ncompelled to go to Memphis to get\na bath Things looked pretty bad for\nOxford in the summer of 1920. Your\npeople were knocking everybody and\neverything and there was a spirit of\nhopelessness written on the face of\nthe most optimistic. Now it is dif\nferent. No very great change, mind\nyou, but a change that is noticeable.”\nWhile our friend was in such a\ngood frame of mind about our town\nwe let him talk on. “Take for in\nstance the painting campaign in your\ntown, you could almost call it a cru\nsade. I have known Oxford a long\ntime and I believe more houses have\nbeen painted in this town in the last\ntwelve months than in a whole genera\ntion before. There is some building\ngoing on, too, the first in ten or twelve\nyears. But the thing that stamps a\ntown as good or bad to the traveling\nman is its business enterprises and\nits hotels. The remodeling of the\nhotel on the square is a pleasant sur\nprise to those of us who have been\n‘making the town' for a number of\n77\nOur “drummer” friend’s remarks\nabout the remodeling of the Colonial\nHotel caused us to get reminiscent\nand wonder what it had been in the\n“good old days” of long ago. In trying\nto answer our own question we found\nsome interesting things about this\nhostelry in the past.\nBack in the days when Benjamin\nHarrison was president of these Uni\nted States and not long after the fam\nous Ku Klux trial was held here in Ox\nford, one Ed Thompson began his\ncareer of servitor to the guests of this\nhotel. If Ed had kept count of the\ntrips he has made from the kitchen\nto the dining room, he could tell you\nhow many times his steps, if they had\nbeen in a straight line and in a eas\nterly direction, wrould have carried\nhim back to the home of his forebears\nsomewhere south of the Sahara Des\nert. For, though, thirty-thre years\nhave passed over his head since the\nday he began, Ed is still bringing in\nthe “loaves and fishes” and looking\nafter the gastronomic needs in gen\neral of those who enter its portals.\nEd is not a fixture but an institution,\nfor he has the “knack” of serving\nthe guests in a way that only years\nof experience brings.\nAnd Ed has not had his eyes shut\nall these years. If he wants to, he\ncan tell you a good many things that\nthe “layman” knows nothing about.\nHe can tell you of things that hap\npened when Mr. Volstead was still\nin knee breeches. But let us warn\nyou not to press him too close on this\npoint, for Ed has a .high sense of\nhonor. When we ventured too far\nand asked him “where they used to\nkeep it” back in the “liquid age,” Ed\nwith a little twinkle very significant\nly remarked: “dey jes hid it ’round,”\nand then after a pause and a sigh,\n“Times sho do change dont dey boss?”\ni According to Ed the parlor for a\nlong time was on the second floor\nover the attractive new home of the\nFirst National Bank, in those same\n“good old days” when fashionable\nladies wore bustless ’n everything.\nThen Oxford was the mecca of beauty\nand fashion for the whole state. The\ndining room was much larger and in it\nthe University balls were held. Sit\nting inside it today one can almost\nhear the students of “After the Ball\nis over” and see the phantom couples\nas they gracefully glide by. For\nthose days, too, were the days of the\nwaltz before we acquired Hawaii and\nimported the hula in such large quan\ntities. Then people danced longitudi\nnally. Now we prefer it vertically.\nWithout wishing to disturb the\npleasant reverie too much candor\ncompels us to drag in some other\nscenery, or this sketch would be too\nmuch like a fairy tale—not supposed\nto be true. That was not only the\ntime when “knighthood” was in\nflower,” but also when the coal oil\nlamp was in full bloom and stank\neloquently. John D. Rockefeller was\nstill on his first million then and was\nhunting for Henry Ford to help him\nconcoct some scheme to get rid of his\nsurplus oil The “Old oaken bucket’\nwas still in the well, but that was be\n<* 1 1 _ 1 i- A m n if Kd -\nIUIC IUC4V —\ning down there. Our guess is that\nthe one who wrote that poem had both\nhot and cold water in his room.\nThe Colonial “in those days” was\nadorned in her coal oil lamps and but\ntressed with her oaken bucket. A\nwhite maid used to “tote” water for\nthe guests from a well that was just\nback of the hotel. Life then in some\nrespects was simple and pleasant.\nBaths were taboo. Mr. Gillette was\nstill working on his razor and hadn’t\ninfested the country with them and\nwater was used for drinking purposes\nby some only as a “tracer.”\nIn 1900 or thereabout Oxford took\nher first progressive step and install\ned water works, a sewer system and\nelectric lights. But the Colonial con\ntinued to entertain guests with out\nthe luxury of a private bath . In\nfact, that remained for the present\nmanagement to install in 1922, the\nfirst private bath in hotel in Oxford.\nThat may seem amusing to some but\nthey should recall that the King of\nEngland installed his first one only\na few years ago. A number of\nchanges for the better have been made\nin recent months. Not only is the\nbuilding more attractive from the out- i\nside, but the inside is being worked\nover And the best of all is the spirit\nof optimism that our friend spoke\nabout that prevades the whole estab\nlishment.

E. PEGUES\n! OXFORD, MISS. '\nproprietor and manager has a feeling\nthat Oxford deserves the best and^ is\nmobilizing with that in view. She\nis succeeding remarkably well and we\nare proud to have her as a citizen of\nour town. After looking a bit we\nare convinced that our friend was\nright Oxford is “looking up.”\n|\nWALLACE—HARPER.\nA most beautiful wedding was sol\nemnized at the First Methodist church\nof this city on Thursday evening at\nsix-thirty o’clock, when Miss Vyvian\nHumphreys Wallace of this city be\ncame the bride of Mr. William Meyer\nHarper of Monroe, La., the Rev. R.\nO. Brown, officiating.\nThe pretty and spacious auditorium\nof the church waws never more beau\ntiful than on this occasion, with its\ngarden setting of pink roses, inter\nmingling with the green of Southern\nsmilax and ferns- The arches over\nthe two aisles, under which the bridal\nparty passed, were radiant with\nsmilax and roses and from the centre\nof these arches were suspended ivory\nbaskets filled with bouquets of pink\nand green. The arch under which\nthe happy couple stood was decorat\ned in a shower of pink roses. The\nchoir rail and altar were banked with\nferns and numerous candles added\nsoft light and beauty to the occasion.\nAwaiting the wedding hour, Mrs.\nH. Lee Herring sang “My World,’' and\n“The Sweetest Story Ever Told,”\nwith Mrs. Vernon Burks at the piano.\nThe glad strains of Mendelsohn’s Wed\nding March announced the arrival of\nthe bridal party, the maids wearing\ngowns of panne velvet in pastel\nshades, with silver trimmings, and\ncarrying arm bouquets of Russell\nEntering in order came Miss Maude\nAndei-son, prettily attii-ed in blue, and\nDr. William J. Lusk; Mrs. W. F. Gol\nladay, in oi*chid, and Mr. William\nStewart Dixon; Miss Louise Marshall,\nin yellow, and Mr. Ernest Mann. Mrs.\nWilliam Stewart Dixon, sister of the\nbride, as matron of honor, woi-e a\ngown of pink panne velvet, trimmed\nin brocaded silver cloth. Then follow\ned the flower girls, Misses Margaret\nKeys and Eleanor Boyett, daintly at\ntii'ed in blue and pink accordeon plait\ned dresses, and Master Robert Edward\nDavisson, in a suit of white satin,\ncarried the ling on a heart-shaped\npillow.\nThe bride, met at the altar by Mr.\nHarper and his best man, Mr. Joe\nDawkins of Monre, La. w as never more\nlovely than in beautiful wedding robe\nof white satin and crepe, trimmed 1\nwith real lace and pearl ornaments,\nthe veil caught with orange blossoms ;\ncovered the entire legnth of the court\ntrain. Her flowers were a shower\nbouquet of bride’s roses, orchids and\nvalley roses.\nThe beautiful ring ceremony was\nemployed and the wedding party in\nfront of the decorative back-ground\nof pink and green while the ceremony\nwas being spoken, formed a picture\nbeautiful to behold. Immediately\nafter the ceremony an informal recep\ntion was held for the bridal party at\nthe home of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\nMr. and Mrs. Harper left on the\neighty-thix*ty train for New' Orleans i\nand coast points. Mrs. Harper w'ox'e ;\nan exquisite going away gown of\nblack silk duvetyn, trimmed with\nsquirrel, with hat and accessories in\nharmony.\nOn their return after October 1st\nthey will be at home to their friends\nin Monroe, La.—Ruleville Recoi'd,\nRuleville, Miss.\n7 l(\n- !•\nWHO WERE THE WINNERS?\nIn the drawing for flour and sugar .\n■vhich began Sept. 9 and closed Sept.1\n16 we wish to state that No. 655 drew <\n;he sugar and No. 918 drew the flour, j\nNeither of these numbers have been l)\nirought in and wish every body would !\nook over their tickets ans we are an- tl\ncious to deliver the sugar and flour, j\nLAFAYETTE COUNTY FARM i\nBUREAU. 1\n___ | <\nNOTICE! 1\nThere will be a meeting of the\n?arent-Teachers’ Association Friday\niftemoon at 3:30 in the high school\nluditorium.

The grading for this\nti'ack was begun Saturday, September\n16. The College site is a beautiful\nwooded tract of 100 acres on North\nParkway, in the City of Memphis.\nThis track, it is said, will pay for\nitself several times over in the hand\nling of building materials, fuel and\nsupplies for the college. As will be\nremembered Southwestern, the College\nof the Mississippi Valley, is South\nwestern Presbyterian University of\nClarksville, Temp, being removed and\nestablished in Memphis as a college.\nIn October, 1920, the citizens of\nMemphis subscribed half a million\ndollars for the new institution and\nPresbyterians and other friends in the\nsynods of Alabama, Louisiana, Mis\nsissippi and Tennessee subscribed one\nmillion dollars additional for South\nwestern.\nIt is planned with the hearty co\noperation of subscribers, to open the\ncollege for work in September, 1923.\nEARLY DAYS IN\nLAFAYETTE COUNTY\nTlie Daughters of the American\nRevolution in David Reese Chapter\nat Oxford have for the subject of their\nprogram this winter the early history\nof Lafayette County. It is not their\naim to write the history of the county\n—1 am told Mr. Stevens plans to do\nthat—but to get together and pre\nserve old records so that the history\nthat is fast being lost may be pre\nserved. Different members of the\nchapter are looking for different\nkinds of records and the Eagle in\ntends to publish the results of these\nsearches. The D. A. R. appeal to the\ncitizens of the county to help them\nin getting these records and in cor\nrecting and adding to these papers as\nthey appear in the Eagle.\nThe divisions of the subject and\nthe chairman in charge of each are\nas follows:\nOld Wills, Deeds, Land Titles, and\nLetters ....Miss Nan R.

L.\nBondurant.\nIf any one in the county can give\ncopies of any such records as the\nabove the chapter will appreciate it.\nYou can communicate with any of the\nabove or with Mrs. Calvin S. Brown,\nthe Chapter Regent.\nThe United States Government fur\nnishes a marker for the grave of every\nRevolutionary soldier and is most\nanxious to mark these graves. At the\nrequest of the government the D. A.\nR. will try to locate all such graves,\nrhis chapter learned last r 'ar that in |\n1840 4 Revolutionary soldiers, an very\n>ld, were drawing pensions in this\n;ounty. Can any one give the loca\n;ion of their graves? The soldiers\nvere as follows:\nThomas Walker, who lived with\nFohn Walker.\nWilliam Gillespie who lived with D.\n5. Willis.\nLeonard Miller, who lived with Ben\nHiller.\nDavid Manow who lived with Wil\niam Sims.\nThe first D. A. R. paper in this se\n•ies is a brief review of the early his\nory of the county written by Miss\nlallie Belle Duncan.

But re\ngardless of the wisdom thereof, there\nremains the fact that I owe a debt of\ngratitude to those men and women\nwho saw fit to honor me with a re\nsponsiblity which means much to my\npresent and will, I hope, mean more\nto my future. It is impossible at this\ntime to express my thanks other than\nin words but it is my sincerest purpose\nthat eventually I shall render such\nservice that my obligation to you may\nfind expression in deeds which will be\nmore substantial and meaningful.\nAgainst those who supported either\nof my opponents I have no complaints\nto offer. If all office-seekers were of\nas conscientious a type as the two gen\ntlemen who opposed me there would\nbe no need for reform in politics. As\nI have maintained since my first an\nnouncement, the present mayor has\nbeen one of the best we have ever\nhad. His interest in the welfare of\nthe community has never been doubt\ned. Any suggestions or counsel which\nhe cares to offer will at all times be\nwelcomed and invited.\nMay any ill-will which may have\narisen over the contest be speedily\nforgotten in co-operation for the high\nest good to the greatest numbers re\ngardless of political convictions.\nI Thanking you again for the con\nsideration already given me and so\nliciting your continued support in\nthose things which I shall undertake\nin your behalf, I am,\nI Respectfully yours,\nR.

I was very\nweak and so nervous. 1 had faint\ning spells and suffered a great deal,\nbut more from the weak, trembly,\nno-account feeling than anything\nelse. 1 knew I needed a tonic, and\nneeded it badly. I began the use\nof Cardui to see if I couldn’t get\nsome strength, as I knew of other\ncases that had been helped by its\nuse. I soon saw a great improve\nment, so 1 kept it up. 1 used seven\nbottles of Cardui, and can say the\nmoney was well spent, for 1 grew\nwell and strong. Am now able to\ndo all my housework and a great\ndeal of work besides.”\nIf you are weak, run-down,\nnervous and suffer from the ail\nments peculiar to women, it is\nvery likely that Cardui will help\nyou, in the way it helped Mrs.\nLange and has helped thousands\nof others, during the past 40 years.\nAsk for, and insist on, Cardui.\nCARDUI\'\nThe Woman’s Tonic ^\n______________ i«w\n^New October^^^J\nVictor Records j\nHere is the complete list of new Victor Record releases for ^October.

Malaria is not ac\nquired by eating improper food, by\ndrinking bad water, by bathing in the\nsun, or in any other way than by the\nbite of a mosquito. True, if one al\nready has malaria, that is, has these\nparasites already in the blood, doing\nthes things will develop it—“bring it\nout”—so that he m«y have a malarial\nattack which ,he could otherwise es\ncape, but only if he is already infec\nted with malaria.\nDo all kinds of mosquitoes trans\nmit malarial parasites to man?\nNo. Only Anopheles mosquitoes\ncarry malaria, and only some kinds\nof Anopheles.\nAre mosquitoes bom with this\npower of conveying malaria?\nNo. They acquire it only by biting\na man who has these parasites in\nhis blood. The parasites are taken\nthen from a man by a mosquito and\ngo back from the mosquito to an\nother man. Where the parasites first\nstarted we do not know.\nHow then does malaria spread?\nExactly like yellow fever. A fe\nmale mosquito of a certain kind\nfeeds on a man infected with malaria\nand sucks up blood with malarial\nparasites in it. She can not convey\nmalaria to thoes whom she bites for\nsome days (a week or more) after\nthis, but after waiting a while (the\nreason for which will be told later)\nshe injects these parasites into other\nmen whom she bites and infects them\nwith malarial fever.\nWhat, then, is necessary to spread\nmalarial fever?\nAnopheles mosquitoes; malarial\nparasites and healthy men. The\nparasites may be either already in\nthe infected mosauitoes or in infect\ned men, from whom the mo&Jtfifoes\ncan get them by biting.\nCONTRACT LET FOR EQUIPMENT\nCHEMICAL BUILDING EQUIP\nMENT WILL BE INSTALLED\nSOON.\nm i—i .■ i\nThe contract for the equipment of\nthe new chemical laboratory at the\nUniversity of Mississippi was let by\nArchitect Theo.
