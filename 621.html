It is an examination of two plaques marking the \nsite of the Bloody Island massacre, exploring how memorial representations produce and silence historical \nmemory of genocide under emerging and shifting historical narratives. A 1942 plaque is contextualized to \nshow the co-option of the Pomo and massacre memory by an Anglo-American organization dedicated to \nsettler memory. A 2005 plaque is read as a decentering of this narrative, guiding the viewer through a new \nhierarchy of memory and events. Overall this article unpacks the strategies of preservation, transformation, \nand reconciliation of genocide as it relates to the construction and shifts in emerging historical narratives, \nunderscoring the interplay of physical locations in the construction of remembering and forgetting atrocious \nhistory.\nKeywords: Pomo, Bloody Island, California, genocide, massacre, American Indian, Native Sons of the \nGolden West, Clear Lake, violence, memory, memorials, settler colonialism, history\nIntroduction\nAs you drive south down Highway 20 in Lake County, California, USA, you will pass Pomo Pumps \nfilling station, replete with a Drive-Thru Smoke Shop. On your left will be the glittering lights of the \nRobinson Rancheria Casino, a ubiquitous indicator that you are now on reservation land, despite \nthe dearth of other markers. A distracted driver would easily miss the turnoff to Reclamation Road, \nwhere a 1942 plaque attached to a small rock sits next to a cluster of mailboxes and residential \ndriveways. It is nearly impossible, however, to not notice the signs for California Landmark 427, \na memorial erected in 2005 commemorating the Bloody Island massacre. There is even a paved \nturnout area and included placards about the local wildlife. Yet, even from this vantage point, only \nthe most astute observer would be able to locate Bo-no-po-ti (literally Old Island), the physical site \nof the 15 May 1850 massacre of the Pomo people. Here the United States Calvary murdered an \nestimated 75-150 Pomo people, the majority of whom were women and children. Operating under \nthe erroneous belief that these victims had murdered two notoriously brutal white settlers, the US \nCalvary attacked this traditional gathering site with artillery, riflemen, and bayonets, turning Old \nIsland into Bloody Island.  \nA focused study of the Bloody Island massacre imparts a powerful lesson on the discourse \nof genocide remembrance. In the Foucauldian sense of the ontology of the present, this article views \npublic history as wrought with presentism.1 As historian Ari Kelman clearly puts it, memorial sites \n“inflect how history is recalled”, where contemporary viewers and memorial framers cast their \nviews of the past “toward the present and the future.”2 Memorials set in stone a hierarchy of a \nnarrative.3 Around sites of violence, newer memorial structures subvert the heterogeneous versions \nof the past in order to create a single unifying history.4 In memorializing history, a single narrative, \nalbeit one that aims to remember the often-historically silenced victims, dominates visual memory \nin bloodstained landscapes, creating problematic issues of forgetting in their remembering.5 Bloody \nIsland, however, is a unique site of two visual narratives. Two memorial plaques, erected in 1942 \nand 2005, exist side-by-side, occupying nearly the same space for very different purposes. These \ntwo narrative structures each frame the massacre for varying ideological and political purposes \nheld by differing stakeholders. The memorials each use the massacre site to root their depictions of \nhistory into a textual creation. \nThe dueling narratives constructed around this one violent event are both unique to Bo-nopo-ti\nand California settler history, yet connected to the active memorial ground surrounding \nglobal indigenous slaughter under colonial expansion. Established narratives are decentered at \n', '62\nClear Lake, where the two plaques coexist, yet each posits very different accounts of history. The \npreservation and evolution of each of these plaques, however, contributes to our understanding \nof why a detailed examination of localized genocide memorial sites is critical to regional and \nglobal history. The inclusion of different historical accounts underscores the evolving interplay \nand reshaping of genocide preservation, memorialization, and narrative construction. These \nhistoric landmarks remember and silence events, where the 2005 Pomo-sponsored plaque subverts \nthe 1942 Anglo-American placed marker. Yet, the 1942 plaque, while extremely problematic in \nits foundation and depiction of the massacre, has not been removed, but rather preserved and, \nas this article shows, reshaped in its reclamation. A new historical narrative emerges from the \nimplied dialogue between two different massacre markers. In leaving the 1942 plaque physically \nintact, the two memorials create a polyphonic version of the past, honoring and commemorating \nslaughtered Native peoples in a mosaic of memorial practices. A microhistory of this site and these \nplaques therefore creates a highly localized account of reconciliation and remembrance with global \nmemorialization implications.\nThe Bloody Island Massacre\nBo-no-po-ti was a traditional Pomo gathering site. Also known as Badon-napo-ti (Island Village), \nhundreds of indigenous Pomo people in the Clear Lake region converged on the island every \nspring for the annual fish spawn. In the first years of the nineteenth century, it was estimated \nthat the Northern California Pomo population was between 10,000 and 18,000, with 3,000 Pomo \nresiding within the Clear Lake basin itself.6 Russian settlement at Fort Ross in 1812 brought about \nthe first of many exploitative Euro-American encounters and in 1817 the San Rafael Mission was \nestablished with the aim of making Christian converts out of the nearby Pomo people. The mission \nwas aided by Luis Arguello, later the first provisional governor of California, who, with a contingent \nof Spanish soldiers, led many expeditions into Pomo territorial lands in order to bring the Pomo \nfurther into the mission system of subjugation. When California became part of the Mexican \nRepublic in 1822, large tracts of Pomo land were designated for settlement. The encroachment of \nsettlers also unleashed epidemics of disease, including a massive malaria outbreak in 1832, the \nspread of measles from Fort Ross in 1847, and a smallpox epidemic brought about by the surge of \nprospectors during the gold rush of 1848. By 1850, the local aboriginal population of the Northern \nPomo, having either fled due to American and European settlement or succumbed to disease, was \nestimated as fewer than 400.7 \nThis small number of remaining Pomo in Lake County continued to clash with settlers while \nhaving their basic rights further eroded. Following the defeat of Mexico in the Mexican-American \nWar (1846-1848), California was annexed by the expanding United States. Prior to 1846, indigenous \nCalifornians were considered Mexican citizens. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ceded \nCalifornia to the United States, included clauses under Article VIII and IX that allowed Mexican \ninhabitants in California to either maintain their “title and rights” as Mexican citizens or “elect to \nbecome citizens of the United States.”8 The rights of indigenous Californians are not explicated \naddressed in this treaty, however under Article XI the treaty noted that “the sacredness of this \n[treaty’s] obligation shall never be lost…when providing for the removal of the Indians from any \nportion of the said territories, or for its being settled by citizens of the United States.”9 Furthermore, \nreferences to “savage tribes” in Articles IV and XII underscore that citizenship protection would \nnot be extended to the indigenous Californians.10 The California Constitutional Convention of 1849 \ndeferred discussion of rights for indigenous people to the State Legislature, scheduled to meet \nafter Congress approved the statehood of California. In 1850, the first State Legislature met and \nimmediately denied indigenous Californians voting rights, and further legislated “that no Indian \ncould serve as a witness for or against any white,” thus excluding indigenous Americans from \nthe recourses of the judicial system.11 It has been argued, moreover, that the April 1850 Act for the \nGovernment and Protection of Indians was a thinly disguised authorization for white citizens to hold \nnon-citizen Indians as slaves, implicitly sanctioning the kidnapping of thousands of indigenous \nchildren.12\nThe Bloody Island massacre was the tragic result of Pomo mistreatment at the hands of white \nsettlers. In 1847, two American settlers, Charles Stone and Andrew Kelsey purchased a large cattle \nGarsha\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n', '‘Reclamation Road’\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n63\nranch from Mexican Captain Salvador Vallejo, and with it his Pomo vaqueros (cowboys).13 As the \nfirst white settlers in Clear Lake, today the site of the cattle ranch is a town called Kelseyville, \nnamed after Andrew Kelsey. Stone and Kelsey were notoriously brutal and violent men. The Pomo \nwere worked as slave laborers on the ranch, paid with rations of only four cups of wheat per day.14 \nFurthermore, the Pomo were forbidden to hunt or fish on any of Kelsey and Stone’s land, and \nthus unable to supplement their meager food supply. When gold fever struck in 1848, Kelsey and \nStone conscripted fifty of their laborers to work in the Sacramento gold fields. Beyond the brutal \nconditions of gold mining and the general mistreatment by Stone and Kelsey, it is reported that \nAndrew Kelsey abandoned the mining endeavor and sold the Pomo workers’ food and supplies \nto a nearby mining outpost. Bereft of supplies, 48 of the 50 Pomo laborers starved to death on their \nreturn march to Clear Lake.15\nImpoverished and malnourished, the indigenous workers on Kelsey and Stone’s cattle ranch \nwere routinely beaten and tortured. Even among other violent settlers, Kelsey and Stone were \nknown for their viciousness toward aboriginals. According to journalist Gaye LeBaron, “even \nCalifornia’s earliest historian, H. H. Bancroft, who had a propensity to glorify the American \npioneers, has written that Kelsey and Stone were ‘rough men, often in trouble with the authorities, \nand were men who scorned to use conciliatory methods with [to deal with, in the words of Andrew \nKelsey] ‘Injuns and such varmint’.”16 Bancroft goes on to write that “Kelsey and Stone were both \nkilled, as well they deserved to be.”17 Yet, while Kelsey and Stone may have been disliked by their \ncontemporaries, their murder at the hands of indigenous actors was nevertheless viewed as a great \nthreat to settler society. It was the retaliation to the deaths of Kelsey and Stone that triggered the \nBloody Island massacre.\nAccording to official reports filed just after the Bloody Island massacre, the antecedents stem \nfrom Kelsey and Stone’s mistreatment of their Pomo workers. Sometime in January 1850, it was \nalleged that a young Pomo worker “threatened the wife [of Andrew Kelsey], for which he received \n100 lashes.”18 Indigenous Pomo oral traditions maintains the boy was actually sent by his ailing \naunt to request additional wheat.19 Irrespective of the charge, the excessive punishment was a \ncommon practice, not only on Stone and Kelsey’s ranch but also throughout Lake County. Reports \nof Pomo workers dying from injuries sustained during lashes are enshrined in Pomo oral history. \nAccording to William Raganal Benson, a Pomo elder and Tribal historian born twelve years after \nthe massacre, it was common to see:\nsuch a whipping and [the] tying [of] their hands together with rope. The rope [was] then \nthrown over a limb of a tree and then drawn up until the Indians[’] toes barely touched the \nground and [they] let them hang there for hours…Such punishment occurred two or three \ntimes a week and many [an] old man and woman [weakened from starvation] died from fear.20\nIn the official Indian Affairs’ report, an hour after this particular Pomo youth had received 100 \nlashes, Andrew Kelsey’s brother, Benjamin, returned to the scene and shot the boy in the head, \nwhich caused the Pomo to flee the ranch, only to return later with weapons in order to avenge \nhis death.21 Absent from the official reports is the fact that Kelsey and Stone had also taken local \nPomo Chief Augustine’s wife as a sex slave.22 While Stone and Kelsey were away, Augustine’s \nwife sabotaged their stored weapons’ cartridges. When her people came to liberate her and \nretaliate against their mistreatment, Stone and Kelsey’s tampered guns misfired and they were left \ndefenseless. Andrew Kelsey was shot with multiple arrows; Charles Stone fled out a window, but \nwas quickly chased down and murdered on the riverbank.23  \nThe decision to murder Kelsey and Stone was sparked by a combination of mistreatments, \nincluding by the death of the workers forced to mine for gold and wander back after Kelsey sold \ntheir rations, the whipping and murder of a Pomo boy, the abduction of Chief Augustine’s wife, \nand a culmination of years of beatings and starvation. After the uprising, the death of Kelsey and \nStone ushered in a retaliatory massacre, led not by civilians and local militias, but rather at the \nhands of the United States Government. \nFollowing the murders of Kelsey and Stone, the Pomo workers fled the cattle ranch. It is \nalleged that Chief Augustine sought refuge on Bo-no-po-ti, but there is little evidence to collaborate \n', 'Garsha64\nthis claim. Andrew Kelsey’s brother, along with neighboring whites, formed a vigilante posse and \nwaged a random campaign of violence against all Clear Lake Pomo. Even the official report admits \nthat Benjamin Kelsey:\ncollected a strong force and on pretense of going to the lake and punishing the murderers \nbut instead of which they commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of the Indians who \nreside on farms working for Americans and in one night slew twenty. They were prevented \nby the citizens from utterly annihilating them, and most of them arrested by order of the \nGovernment, but no further proceedings instituted.24\nIt was well known at the time that Benjamin Kelsey and his gang traveled into Sonoma, Calistoga, \nand Napa, and murdered “innocent Indians…[who] had no hand” in the murder of Kelsey.25 The \nposse was arrested and brought to San Francisco, however, “they were set free on habeas corpus \nand never brought to trial.”26 Official reports submitted by a U.S. Calvary officer claim that while \ndetaining Kelsey and his party, the U.S. Army “captured 12 Indians of the Isla tribe, who live upon \nthe lake.”27 The officer, upholding the paternalistic trope of the state, notes that these captives \n“would undoubtedly have been put to death by Kelsey’s party, had not the presence of an officer \nrestrained them.”28 It is from these prisoners that the Calvary allegedly learned about “two chiefs \nof the tribe, which lived upon Kelsey’s farm, [who] were on an island in the lake.”29 \nIn fact, the Pomo at Bo-no-po-ti never worked on Stone and Kelsey’s ranch, and had nothing \nto do with their murders. The Calvary report detailed the invasion plan on Bo-no-po-ti, outlining \nan assault of “two parties of 30 men each” while “a party 50 strong” flanked the only retreat.30 It \nalso advised a sneak attack under the cover of darkness, in order to “surprise [the Pomo] in their \nRancherias and cut them to pieces.”31 The overwhelming force was based on the Calvary officer’s \nsupposed belief that 400-600 Pomo armed warriors were stationed on the island.32 In actuality, the \nisland was mostly populated with women and children. \nWhen the battle-hardened 1st Dragoons division of the U.S. Calvary assaulted the island, five \nmonths later, they encountered zero resistance. The government soldiers, in overwhelming numbers \nand with the use of heavy artillery rowed across the lake in appropriated fishing boats, decimated \nthe trapped Pomo Indians. In his report describing the attack, Captain Nathaniel Lyon stated, \n“the island soon became a perfect slaughtering pen.”33 After gunning down fleeing women and \nchildren, Captain Lyon ordered his soldiers to follow the Pomo into the thick reeds surrounding \nthe marshy waters and “pursue and destroy as far as possible.”34 He reported a confirmed sixty \nPomo Indians killed, but had little doubt that the body count was upwards of one hundred.35 He \nstated that there were 400 Pomo on the island and that the U.S. Calvary sustained no injuries and \nreceived ineffective return fire.36 \nHistorian Benjamin Madley has called for a careful reading of one-sided causality rates when \nofficial narratives of resistance are employed, cautioning that this often masks the true genocidal \naims of government forces.37 The subsequent narrative of a battle, or tropes of self-defense require \na notion that the government forces faced insurmountable opposing forces, or were responding \nto fierce aggression with equivalent and appropriate force. While the reconnaissance reports \nmentioned above stated that the U.S. Calvary anticipated encountering fierce resistance from the \nsupposed 400 warriors, it is interesting that Lyon’s own official report maintains a transparent \nnarrative of slaughter and the absence of return fire. From the inception of the massacre, the military \nsaw no need to create a counter-narrative to justify the atrocity, suggesting their expectation that \nClear Lake settlers would condone the bloodshed. At least initially, however, this was not the case.\n \nMedia Portrayal of the Massacre\nFollowing the massacre, Old Island became known as Bloody Island in the public lexicon. Just \ndays after the massacre, the Alta California newspaper reported the event with the headline, “[a] \nhorrible slaughter of Indians.”38 The article reminded the reader, “the tribe that incurred this \nterrible punishment…has maintained, in general, undisturbed peaceful relations with the white \nsettlers” of the area.39 While it noted that the military action was a reprisal for the murder of Kelsey, \nthe article refuted its justification when it claimed:\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n', '‘Reclamation Road’\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n65\nLast summer…a stubborn family Indian offered an indignity to the wife of Kelsey…was \nsentenced to receive one hundred lashes…[but] after the punishment…Kelsey laid him dead, \nshooting him in the presence of several gentlemen who remonstrated him on the barbarity of \nthe deed…Kelsey was afterwards murdered…Since then repeated acts of violence have been \nvisited upon the natives.40 \nThe newspaper report underscores that there was little public affinity for the Kelseys and their \nilk. Furthermore, the article argued that any justified retribution for Kelsey’s murder had already \nbeen dealt, thus the Pomo slaughter was simply an act of genocide guised under legal punishment. \nIn this regard the newspaper specifically charged the U.S. Calvary, under the command of Lt. \nDavidson and Captain Lyon, with trying to intentionally “exterminate…the Clear Lake Indians.”41 \nThe newspaper quoted an unnamed informant, who reported “indiscriminate destructive fire \nupon men, women, and children”. The informant said, “they fell as grass before the sweep of the \nscythe.” The article concluded once more with the charge of genocide, claiming that the attack on \nBloody Island “was [an] order of extermination fearfully obeyed.”42\nFascinatingly, the Alta California newspaper drastically reversed their account just four \ndays later. In the subsequent article, the newspaper revealed that the unnamed informant was \nCaptain J. H. Frisbie, “a gentleman well known and universally respected.”43 The article now \nstated that General Persifor F. Smith pronounced Captain Frisbie’s “account to be false…and in \nthe very strongest possible language…also questioned the motives for its publication.”44 By way of \nretraction, the Alta California printed the only other account “of the Clear Lake affair,” though the \nnewspaper hinted at dissent when it pointed out “from what source the information of our new \ncontemporary was derived we are of course ignorant. It will accord much satisfaction to believe it \ntrue.”45 \nThe reprinted account challenged the veracity of the Alta California article, calling the Clear \nLake incident a “rumored massacre…greatly exaggerated…and wholly misrepresented.”46 In the \nnew version:\nA party of Indians…after committing many murders and other outrages…took refuge in one \nof the numerous islands of the Lake…Captain Lyon was ordered to proceed to Clear Lake, \nand to punish and dislodge the Indians from their stronghold…The men advanced in boats, \n(which they had transported with great labor across the mountains,) and were received \nwith a shower of arrows. In combat many of the soldiers were seriously wounded, and a \nnumber of Indians killed. The statement that women and children were massacred is wholly \nunfounded…This is the true history of the horrible slaughter of the Clear Lake Indians.47\nBoyd Cothran’s laudable recent work on memory, violence, and notions of innocence \nsurrounding the Modoc War (1872-1873) tracks narrative shifts in newspaper reporting. Cothran \nnoted that standard notions of American innocence were employed against a backdrop of Indian \nsavagery in order to portray white victims of violence as “fundamentally innocent.”48 In the \ncase of Kelsey and Stone, however, innocence was an impossible trope as their brutality was so \nwell established. The new narration, therefore, relied on the notion of depicting the Pomo as \nimposing warriors and veterans of murderous campaigns of vaguely defined other outrages. This \ntransformed the massacre site into a battlefield, where the brave Dragoons, who painstakingly \ncarried their boats over the mountain passes, are bathed in arrows. Many American soldiers are \ninjured, thus showing the prowess and power of their enemy, yet none are miraculously killed, \nthus underscoring divine intervention and the strength of these soldiers. The new narrative views \nthe Calvary men as heroically defending themselves and settler society in a preemptive attack. The \nstory is sold by marginalizing the actions of true slaughtered innocents yet paradoxically recasting \nthem as powerful warriors. Thus the soldiers become defenders engaged in a struggle against an \noverwhelming force and champions of American innocence.49 It is also important to see frontier \nnewspaper reporting as influencing, and influenced by, public opinion and state control. The \ncountering reports in the Alta California offer up two versions of a historical event that echoed \nforward for over one hundred and fifty years. \n', 'Garsha\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n66\nThe Native Sons of the Golden West and the 1942 Memorial\nThe Upper Lake basin today has been drained to the point that Bloody Island now stands as a hilltop. \nLandmark 427, erected in 2005, makes no mention of where the island was once located. One must \ntravel a quarter mile down a street called Reclamation Road to see the massacre site close-up. There \nstands a faded and contentious plaque, installed by the Native Sons of the Golden West in 1942.  \nLike the two newspaper reports about the Bloody Island violence, the dual massacre markers \nput forth two very different narratives of the past. The 1942 plaque calls the site the “scene of a battle \nbetween U.S. Soldiers under the command of Captain Lyons (sic) and Indians under Chief Augustine.” \nThe 2005 inscription posits that it was not a battle, but rather the location where “a regiment of the 1st \nDragoons of the U.S. Cavalry, Commanded by Capt. Nathaniel Lyon and Lt. J.W. Davidson, massacred \nnearly the entire native population of the island.” The full text of the plaque goes on to state:\nMost were women and children. This act was in reprisal for the killing of Andrew Kelsey \nand Charles Stone who had long enslaved, brutalized, and starved indigenous people in the \narea. The Island, now a hill surrounded by reclaimed land, remains a sacred testament to \nthis sacrifice of innocents. \nThere is a great deal to criticize regarding the 1942 plaque. Firstly, it places the massacre date \non 15 April 1850, one month earlier than even the official reports note. Secondly, Captain Lyon \nis mistakenly referred to as Captain Lyons. Most ominously, the plaque uses the common trope \nthat the event was a battle, much like the second report reprinted in the Alta California newspaper, \nlikening the event to a balanced fight between “Cowboys and Indians.”50\nFigure 1. Bloody Island 1942 Plaque.\nThe Bloody Island plaque was erected on 20 May 1942, 92 years and 5 days after the Bloody Island \nmassacre. Behind the plaque’s construction, as mentioned above, was a group known as the Native \nSons of the Golden West. The Native Sons were an Anglo-American organization responsible for \nmany of the placards and historical landmarks scattered throughout California. The group still \nexists today, though it is a much more whitewashed charitable organization compared to their \nmembership when they installed this particular plaque.51 \nThe Native Sons of the Golden West sought to preserve a specific narrative of history, with \na strong emphasis on the positive role white settlers played in creating California history. The \norganization’s name can be unpacked to see the use of “Native” as both an approbation of \n', '‘Reclamation Road’\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n67\nindigeneity and an ownership over California; suggesting they, not the indigenous people, are the \ntrue autochthonous “sons of the soil” in California.52 This patrilineal notion is reinforced by the \nsignifier Sons which suggests a legacy and birthright, coopted and repurposed by the Native Sons \norganization, a group that would only accept membership from white men born in California. In \nthis reading, Golden West posits the notion that California history did not begin until the midnineteenth\ncentury’s gold rush. It is fitting that the birth of the Native Sons of the Golden West \nbegan in 1890 with the purchase and restoration, for historical preservation, of Sutter’s Fort. \nThe Fort reports to be the earliest non-indigenous central Californian community, and thus the \nbirthplace of the western settler movement, and by extension the Native Sons.53 It was at Sutter’s \nMill, also owned by the Fort founder John Sutter, where Anglo-Americans first discovered gold \ndeposits in California, resulting in the ensuing rapid migration of settlers during the gold rush.\nWith an obsession of pioneer history, in 1907 the Native Sons began publishing The Grizzly \nBear, a monthly magazine for members. Each issue featured statements and updates from the \nvarious Native Sons chapters, known as parlors, advertisements and announcements, obituaries \nof any pioneer settlers “who came to California prior to 1870”, letters from parlor members and \nreaders, and history writings complied by the Native Sons of the Golden West Grand Historian. \nIn the May 1942 issue, Grand Historian Dr. Peter T. Conmy, a librarian at Oakland Public Library, \nwrote for The Grizzly Bear the Native Sons of the Golden West’s version of the Pomo massacre. \nThe article was written to coincide with the 18 May “Grand Parlor of the Order of the Native \nSons of the Golden West,” the annual main Native Sons meeting which was being held in Lake \nCounty for “the first time in the organization’s sixty-four year history.”54 After a brief history on how \nClear Lake had the largest population of indigenous people in California, due to an “abundance \nof fresh water and the attendant vegetation [which] made the locality attractive to the primitive \npeople,” Conmy anecdotally added a line about how in 1836 “some Indians…wandered down to \nthe Sonoma Valley, committing acts of depredation.” 55 To his credit, Conmy wrote with shades \nof veracity and sympathy toward the Pomo people. He framed Stone and Kelsey as “cruel to the \nIndians,” who ordered “the Indians with a high hand” and shot at them “for the fun of seeing them \njump.”56 Although Conmy noted that Stone and Kelsey were “the first American residents” of Lake \nCounty and that they may have been “upright…with their relations with their fellow-citizens,”57 he \nwas clear about the mistreatment the Pomo suffered under Stone and Kelsey, who “were beaten at \nthe slightest provocation” and he included the fact that Chief Augustine’s wife was “taken over as \na concubine.”58 Nevertheless, Conmy’s description of the events that led up to Stone and Kelsey’s \ndeaths added mitigating factors, such as his version that after Kelsey sold all the supplies on his \nfailed gold mining expedition, it was a “hostile tribe of Indians” who attacked and killed many of \nthe Pomo conscripts, while briefly admitting that “others died of starvation.”59\nCuriously, in Conmy’s version of events, it was not the routine years of mistreatment the Pomo \nendured on Stone and Kelsey’s ranch, since as “unbearable as [that] situation became, the Indians \ncontinued to forebear.”60 The Native Sons consistently maintained the paradoxical approach of \nglorifying American Indian lifestyles and stoicism, while relegating and subverting the indigenous \nCalifornians as primitive people and not the true natives of the West. According to their narrative, \nit was the supposed inter-Indian attack on the returning forced miners that “caused the wrath of \nthe Red Men to rise high and it was determined that the cruelties of Andy Kelsey and Stone should \nbe no longer endured.”61 Conmy’s account accurately described the murders of Stone and Kelsey, \nbut his depiction of the antecedences slightly shifted the direct blame away from the years of abuse, \nstarvation, and torture.       \nFrom November 1939 through November 1943, The Grizzly Bear used the word massacre only \nfour times in four years.62 Conmy’s May 1942 article is one of them. It is not the Pomo, however, \nwho were victims of a massacre. Conmy’s piece employed the traditional settler rhetoric of a battle \nbetween soldiers and Indians, keeping the entire description of the Bloody Island slaughter to a brief \nsentence where “about a hundred Indians were killed and, thoroughly subdued” by “Lieutenant \nLyons (sic)”, who forced “a treaty of peace [to be] made.”63 There is no mention of the women and \nchildren murdered by the U.S. Calvary, nor does the article mention that the soldiers received no \nreturn fire. Where the word massacre is employed, it is in reference to Kelsey and Stone, whose \ndeaths were “regarded as a massacre” to white settlers, which “gave rise to the sentiment among \n', 'Garsha\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n68\nthe settlers that the region of the lakes was a truly dangerous one, and for that reason settlement \nwas slow.”64 For the Native Sons, the historic tragedy of Bloody Island is that it slowed down the \nmigration of white pioneers. \nThe other three utterances of term massacre were also not employed regarding the murder \nof indigenous Americans. In the June 1941 issue, Dr. Peter T. Conmy once again used it, this time \nto describe the 1871 “Chinese massacre” by a mob of anti-Chinese “enraged citizens looking for \na Chinese criminal in…Nigger Alley, and unable to find him, seized and lynched some eighteen \ninnocent Chinese.”65 The next two occurrences are used to frame the ideological underpinnings of \nthe Native Sons during this era. In one instance the “Pearl Harbor massacre” is alluded to in order \nto remind readers that the Japanese, and by extension American born children of Japanese descent, \nwere “as a people, as public enemies, cunning, clever…unworthy of any confidence or trust.”66 \nThe author underscored the central tenant of Native Sons thought, that Anglo-Californians are \nthe native-born inheritors of the American past. Interestingly, in his attempt to other the Japanese, \nauthor J.E. Gardner moved beyond the notion of rooted birthrights. He wrote that JapaneseAmericans,\nwere born in the United States by an “accident of birth” and racialized his assertion that \nJapanese-Americans, “in [their] very blood [hold] so fanatical a devotion to [their] god-emperor \nthat [they] will literally stop at nothing to accomplish [their] ends” and that “we do not want in our \ncommunity any persons of that breed, no matter where born.”67 To Native Sons gripped in wartime \nfever, the California-born Americans of Japanese parents were a threat to the entrenched racial \nhierarchy and color line the Native Sons of the Golden West sought to glorify. \nIn a Grizzly Bear article titled “Let Us Not Be Bequeath A Canker We Should Have Removed—\nThe Japs”, Dr. W.R. Livingston exemplified the prevailing post-Pearl Harbor American vitriol, and \nthe Native Sons’ political position. “If Japan emerges victorious”, he wrote, “it could well mean, \nbefore the lapse of a century, a Mougol (sic) would be found again ravaging Europe” which would \nlead to “the extermination of the White race. A Mongol ravage is not a pretty picture. Genghis \nKhan massacred whole populations in city after city of Persia, and even sent back detachments to \nslay any refugees”.68 The article, published in March 1942 and filled with racist calls for Japanese \ninterment under misguided historical propaganda, included a note from the author sent to the \nNative Sons that expressed the “hope that the portion [of his article] relating to Japs in defense \nareas may be obsolete by the publication date.”69 Indeed, it nearly was.\nThe date of Bloody Island plaque’s installation is incredibly telling. The plaque was erected \n20 May 1942; exactly three months and one day after President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued his \ninfamous Executive Order 9066, the authorization to intern over 100,000 Japanese-Americans. By \nthe time the Native Sons had commemorated the plaque in May, the entire western seaboard had \nbeen declared a military evacuation zone for all Japanese and Japanese-Americans. The timing of \nthis particular plaque, dedicated to a historical event nearly a century removed, is highly suspect \nand cannot be separated from the main political and ideological motivations of the Native Sons, \nwhich had far less to do with historical preservation and much more to do with present tension. \nWhile the Native Sons of the Golden West may have glorified the notion of the Wild West and \ninvested money and time in erecting historical markers of California’s pioneer days, at its core the \ngroup was dedicatedly anti-Japanese. The most prominent member of the group was Earl Warren, \nfuture chief justice of the Supreme Court. When the Bloody Island plaque was commissioned, \nhowever, Warren was the Attorney General of California. In this role, Warren was the leading voice \nbehind the forced removal of Japanese-born and Japanese-descendant Americans. \nFollowing the 7 December 1941 attack at Pearl Harbor, American military and civil leaders \nfeared subsequent attacks along virtually undefended West Coast. Five days later President \nRoosevelt issued executive order 8972, creating militarized patrols along and within national \nborders and empowered the Secretary of War “to take appropriate measures…deemed to be \nnecessary and desirable” for national defense.70 Under this, it became Attorney General Warren’s \ntask to organize California’s civilian defense program. It was feared, irrationally, that Japanese \nAmericans could form a supposed fifth column and wage a campaign of sabotage and support, \nshould Japan successfully invade the United States. In January 1942, one month after Pearl Harbor \nand just five months before the creation of the Bloody Island plaque, Warren warned “the Japanese \nsituation as it exists in this State today may well be the Achilles heel of the entire defense effort.”71 \n', '‘Reclamation Road’\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n69\nAccording to historian Edward White, Warren was “the most visible and effective California public \nofficial advocating internment.”72 Warren was also the most reputable and prominent member of \nthe Native Sons of the Golden West. It was Warren who personally dedicated the 20 May 1942 \nunveiling of the Bloody Island plaque, attending the ceremony as both California’s Attorney General \nand also a representative of the Native Sons’ Fruitvale Parlor 252. Seven years later, as Governor, \nEarl Warren established the California Historical Landmarks Advisory Committee, creating a state \nprogram to organize and manage what was hitherto a privatized affair. Under his membership as \na Native Son, Warren was able to witness the power plaques like the 1942 Bloody Island marker \ncreated in controlling narratives of the past for present, and often political purposes. It is very \nlikely that the Native Son’s particular branding of history and nativism played a prominent role in \nWarren’s outlook and decision to create the Landmarks Committee.73 \nBeyond the decision to intern American citizens, the Native Sons of the Golden West were \nalso involved in a legal battle to strip away the basic voting rights of Japanese-Americans. After \nthe installation of the Bloody Island marker, the Native Sons capitalized on the anti-Japanese \nsentiment with a legal challenge to overturn the 1898 Supreme Court decision in United States v. \nWong Kim Ark, which affirmed that any native-born American, irrespective of race or ethnicity, \nwas an American citizen.74 It is fitting that the Native Sons of the Golden West erected a memorial \nto the Bloody Island “battle” during this legal battle, since the massacre occurred the same year as \nthe passage of the 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians, which denied the Pomo \ncitizenship rights. \nWhile the 1942 Bloody Island marker is seemingly apolitical, the impetus behind its construction \ncannot be separated from the actions of the Native Sons of the Golden West. The fact that while \nthe plaque commemoration was under way, Native Son and former California Attorney General \nUlysses S. Webb was arguing in court that “This is a white man’s country…by the whites, of the \nwhites, and for the whites” while Native Son and current California Attorney General Earl Warren \nwas assisting with the forced internment of Japanese and Japanese-American citizens, makes the \nmotivational intent behind the plaque construction highly suspect.75\nIn preserving a false version of the Pomo Indian massacre, the Native Sons’ plaque asserts \nAnglo-dominance over Californian history. The Pomo on Bloody Island are falsely raised up to \nfierce warriors who challenged the United States. The text seems to suggest that the stronger the \nenemy, the more victorious the winner. The sign also stands in as a message to the JapaneseAmericans,\narguing that the white pioneers and prospectors who conquered the indigenous \nwarriors and settled the West were the true inheritors of California, and the writers of its History. \nFinally, the text of the 1942 plaque seeks to confirm the erroneous fact that Chief Augustine was \non Bo-no-po-ti, and that the battle was a justified response connected to the murders of Kelsey and \nStone. In this regard, the 1942 plaque can be read as a metaphorical embodiment of a scripted \nversion of history first put forth by the revisionist 1 June 1850 Alta California article. \n \nReclamation\nIn 2002, the 1942 marker was desecrated. An unknown person poured red paint over the face \nof the plaque and around the rock on which it stands.76 Today the dried red paint remains, the \ndesecration preserved in order to resemble spilled blood covering the monument. Beginning in \n1999, activists, Pomo descendants, Clear Lake residents, and the general public hold an annual \nsunrise “forgiveness ceremony in honor, remembrance and forgiveness, on behalf of the Pomo \nIndian People that perished and those that survived the Bloody Island Massacre.”77 The vigil takes \nplace at the 1942 marker, where candles are burned and tobacco offerings are made to the Pomo \nancestors whose bodies were cremated and buried, only later to be used in the construction of \ndams around the Upper Lake basin. Notably, the ceremonial event does not take place on the \nanniversary of the massacre, but rather nearest the date of 20 May, the anniversary of when the \n1942 marker was installed. The inclusion of local residents, irrespective of their national origins, \nspeaks to the aim of reconciliation. According to Clayton Duncan, the great-grandson of one of the \nBloody Island survivors, “the ceremony is also to say we’re sorry to our ancestors whose bones \nand ashes were shown such disrespect.”78 The site sits on Reclamation Road, a fitting homage to a \ncontentious plaque, now reclaimed.  \n', 'Garsha\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n70\nClayton Duncan’s great-grandmother was Lucy Moore, one of the very few children to survive \nthe Bloody Island massacre. In 2000 Duncan established the Lucy Moore Foundation, created with \nthe stated mission “to educate the public about the massacre…locate, preserve and memorialize \nthe site of mass graves…and buy the Bloody Island” massacre site in order to “create a Lucy \nMoore Foundation Museum and Cultural Center.”79 The Foundation is also involved in ongoing \ncampaigns to rename “Kelseyville”, stripping away Andrew Kelsey’s legacy and rewriting the \nmemoryscape of Clear Lake.80 In 2005, largely due to Duncan’s efforts, the State Department of \nParks and Recreation, working in partnership with the Lucy Moore Foundation, erected the new \nmemorial plaque, designated California Registered Historical Landmark No. 427, located directly on \nHighway 20.    \nThe ongoing campaign by Duncan and other Pomo activists as well as the larger community \nto create a cultural center, in addition to the continuing annual healing ceremonies, show that \nlandscape around the Bloody Island massacre site is an active ground of memory, still evolving \nand shifting. This process of recreation and reclamation moves slowly. Similarly, while efforts to \nrename Kelseyville have stalled due to the lack of the requisite total number of signatures required \nto bring the proposal to legislation, it should be noted that Clear Lake County is sparsely populated. \nThe movement, like the 2005 plaque, is highly localized in an area of little population density and \nremains an exciting site for scholarly investigation precisely because of its transformations that are \ncurrently playing out.\nFigure 2. Bloody Island 2005 Plaque.\nThe 2005 plaque tells a much more accurate history of the massacre. The narrative is expanded \nto include not only the perpetrators of the massacre, Captain Lyon and Lt. Davidson, but also the \nbackstory of Andrew Kelsey and Charles Stone, who “had long enslaved, brutalized, and starved \nindigenous people.” Interestingly, the 2005 plaque does not replace the 1942 one, but rather stands \nin for a polyphonic narrative of reclamation. The text of the 2005 plaque states that “the island…\n[is] surrounded by reclaimed land.” By moving one quarter of a mile away from the actual site, \nthe 2005 marker is intentionally designed to be the viewer’s first glimpse of the Bloody Island \nmemorialization. In this way it posits itself as the dominant narrative, subordinating the 1942 \nplaque as the alternate, and incorrect, version of the past. For many tourists, the 2005 plaque is the \nonly site they will see. The road signs only point to the new marker, and while the plaque does \nstate that “one-fourth mile west is the island…now called Bloody Island,” the directions are vague, \ndespite the fact that hilltop is clearly visible from Highway 20. The palimpsestesque rewriting of \nthe Pomo massacre narrative allows both markers to be preserved, with a carefully guided tour \nthrough the selected versions of history.\n', '‘Reclamation Road’\n©2015     Genocide Studies and Prevention 9, no. 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.9.2.1292\n71\nConclusion\nNorthern California, like so many colonial lands, has a deep legacy of genocide and struggles \nwith preserving a fractured version of this history. While California was the site of numerous \ngenocides and atrocities against the indigenous peoples, the Bloody Island massacre site is one \nof few memorial structures recognized by the State of California government. Plaque locations \nshape memorial structures by working to both remember versions of a blood-stained past while \nsilencing the imposed meta-narratives that came before them. When studying the process of \nmemorialization surrounding colonial massacres, a connection to the landscape is paramount. On \ntheir own, plaques and the artistic stones in which they are set are meaningless. The narratives they \nconstruct and the audiences they attempt to guide are drawn together by a deeper connection to \nthe grounds that these memorial structures mark. The annual Bloody Island commemorations in \nClear Lake take place at the 1942 marker for important reasons. I have outlined the performative \naspect of reclamation the ceremonies discussed above hold, showing how community events and \nthe vandalism of red paint has transformed and subverted the 1942 plaque away from its founders’ \nintentions. For the Pomo activists and actors, however, that location marks a closer connection to \ntheir ancestors murdered by the U.S. Calvary. While the newer 2005 plaque reshapes the history \nof the massacre for the passing motorist, only by traveling down Reclamation Road and to the \nnow hilltop that was once Bo-no-po-ti, and onto reservation land, can one connect to the events that \ntransformed old island into Bloody Island. Seemingly ironically, this transformative experience \ncomes from visiting a plaque installed by an organization dedicated to settler, Anglo-American \nhistory, arguably erected with anti-Japanese intentions. \nDifferent generations come to terms in differing ways with historical violence in California’s \nlandscape. The reframing of a site of bloodshed from a battle to a massacre involves multiple parties \ncreating epistemological tension with the past. The Bloody Island massacre site marks a place where \nscholars can map the ways individuals, organizations, and communities in the American west have \nboth created and rejected nationalist narratives as well as the establishment of a pluralistic vision \nof history, selectively framed. The physical site of Bloody Island is simultaneously a memorial \nto the murdered, enslaved, and dispossessed first people of California, while also becoming a \nmonument to sovereignty and anti-colonial resistance.81 The Bloody Island massacre site is uniquely \nremembered due to its dual plaques. Like all memorial sites, certain narratives are privileged while \nothers are marginalized: the massacre landscape itself becomes a text of negotiation, contestation, \nand confirmation. By leaving the 1942 plaque intact, however, the site adds a level of perceived \ntransparency, a place where memory and narrative have been renegotiated, while still offering a \nwindow into the attempts to justify imperial expansion and co-opt native identity.82    \nAll past events are challenged, reinterpreted, and reused for present purposes. The connections \nbetween the two Bloody Island plaques, like the connections between Anglo-Americans and \nIndigenous peoples, remind us of our role and responsibility to be viewers, caretakers, and creators \nof a shared and global historical narrative. In this regard, a thorough understanding of the localized \nhistory of the Bloody Island massacre imparts a powerful lesson for genocide scholars, activists, \nand the general public, enriching the discourse of violence and reconciliation in world history. \nJust as more scholarly attention should be devoted to the Bloody Island duality of narratives and \nmarkers, so too should a broader effort exist to create methodological and theoretical conversations \nbetween memorialization of massacres. Localized genocidal events like Bloody Island bring Clear \nLake into the broader frontier wars, massacres, and narrative construction of California. Similarly, \nthe regional history of California fits into our understanding of American expansion, which itself \nshares transnational connections and global memorial practices. In this way, Reclamation Road \nis more than a street in Clear Lake County; it is a conduit into our colonial past and to constantly \nevolving construction of History in the making. \nEndnotes\n1 Hubert L.

Of the remaining four, one is a reference to Roman Emperor Nero, \none is from a prayer by Pope Pius XIII, and the final two are about the “slaughter of truth” by governments \nfighting in a world war that is “resulting in the slaughter of millions of humankind”. “Newsgraphs” The \nGrizzly Bear, May 1943, Supplement 6.\n63 Note the misspelling of Lyon’s name as “Lyons”, possibly the origin of the misspelling on the plaque. \nConmy, “Lake County”, 8.\n64 Conmy, “Lake County”, 8.\n65 Peter T.

My article has called for this kind of approach to expand further west, \nmaking a case for California in spite of the dearth of official memorials.\n82 On a theoretical level, by framing colonial and post-colonial memorials and monuments in this way, my \nargument lines up with historical and anthropological examinations of colonial archives, where memory \nand identity are interwoven in the ways colonial societies and metropoles seek to maintain narratives that \nshowcase the way these societies see themselves, and want to be seen. As texts, these materials can be read \nboth with the grain in order to unpack content, but also against the grain to flesh out context and authorial \nintentions.
