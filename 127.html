        <pre>['[*• Clje Corboba Da tip Ctmes, (Member of the Associated Press) . ., VolT^NoT 221 CORDOVA, ALASKA, THURSDAY, AUGUST 24, 1922 \' ~PR1CE TENCENTS, RAILWAY MAN, SAYS TOURIST, ROUTE IS FINE, S. H. Knickerbocker, general man, ager of the Alaska Steamship Com, pany and the Copper River & North, western Railway, is in Cordova after, having made a first trip into the in, terior. This is, in fact, Mr. Knicker, bocker’s first visit to Alaska, and. as, both a traveler anti a railway execu, tive his impressions of the country, are of special interest. Mr. Knicker, bocker was highly enthusiastic over, ^the scenic beauties of the routes along, >\' the trail to Fairbanks and over the, Government Railway to Seward. “In, my opinion,” said Mr. Knickerbocker, today, “the scenery along the trail be, tween Chitina and Fairbanks cannot, be surpassed. It is one continuous, panorama of mountains, glaciers, rush, ing rivers, beautiful meadows and, rolling country. As a tourist route it, offers the greatest variety of impres, sive and interesting scenes.” Asked, as to his impressions of the agricul, tural possibilities of the interior,- Mr., Knickerbocker said there is no ques, tion that anything can be raised in, the vicinity of Fairbanks that Cati be, grown in any general agricultural sec, tion. “I understand,” Said Mr. Knick, erbocker, “that the farmers in the vi, cinity of Fairbanks are hot yet raising, agricultural products enough to sup, ply the local needs. But the time will, come when Alaska will be able to, produce in this direction all that she, •can consume. The lack of transporta, tion and a market have been the only, elements responsible for the delay in, agricultural development. I was in, terested in noting at Fairbanks that, the soil there is very similar to that, in the Imperial Valley of California,, which is a silt washed down for ages, by the overflow\' of the Colorado River., Much the same condition prevails, around Fairbanks. What is true of all, agricultural lands first being put to, cultivation, however, is true here. It, is necessary, after clearing off t1;5, native growth, to enrich the soil with, nitrates. This is being done by o’ant, ing alfalfa, which is then plowed, under. Crops raised on soil where, this has been done have been very, fine indeed.”, On the subject of encouraging tour, is t travel to Alaska Mr. Knicker, bocker expressed his whole-hearted an, ■\'•proval. “The development of tourist, travel, however,” he added, “is some, thing more than a matter of advertis, ing. " The reputation of the country, will only be the Sufferer from large, numbers of tourists brought, here in, *he absence of adequate accommoda, tions. The roadhouses along the, trails between Chitina and Fairbanks, are. as I understand they are else, where, excellent in their service. Rut, they are not equipped to take care Of, any. large number of travelers. ..\' tour, ist party, for instance, of forty people, would tax even the largest of them,, and in a country like Alaska\' people, must have available places to sleep., Encouragement of tourist visitors, in, a word, is a matter for co-operation on, the part of all concerned. The, railways and steamship lines will he, only too »-eady to advertise the country, and provide transportation facilities if, the trails are finished add kept in, good condition, and adequate accom, modations are provided. The Alaska, Road Commission is doing excellent, work on the Fairbanks trail. But, much still is to be done, appropria, tions for which must be had from the, ■government. The Alaskan towns, -should get behind the commission and, by zealous co-operation do all in their, power to further the development of, roads. The round trip via Fairbanks, between Cordova and Seward is one, of the finest to be had anywhere in, world, and its development cer, tainly deserves the live efforts of, every town in the Territory. It is, simply a matter of co-operation on the, part of all concerned.”, Mr. Knickerbocker leaves on the, Northwestern tonight for Latouche., FISH QUOTATIONS, _ KETCHIKAN, Aug. 24. — Fish, •pfices August 23, halibut 9c and 4c., “IN LINE OF DUTY5’, REPORT ON SHOOTING, OF ARMY OFFICER, _., WASHINGTON, Aug. 24.—Report, of the special Army Board investi, gating the shooting of Lt.

DOHENY, . Hanging in the window of a Juneau, curio shop for some time has been a, watch-chain made of enormous nug, gets, the largest of which weighs some, thing over thirty ounces. \' The chain, has been a source of much interest and, curiosity with tourists, and has been, one of the principal exhibits of the, curio shop. It will no longer be so for, it has been purchased to embellish the, museum collection of a wealthy Cali, fornian. Mrs. E. L. Doheny who, with, her husband, one of the largest oil, operators in the Mexican field, has, lately been in Juneau with a party of, friends\' brought north on the Doheny, yacht, “Casiana,” has acquired the nug, get chain and taken it back with her, to the States., The chain has an interesting history., It was originally, says the Empire, the, property of Pat Renwick of Skagway,, a spectacular character, who added to, the picturesqueness of the north in the, “Days of ’98.” Pat Renwick lived in, Skagway for many years. He affected, the largest of Stetson hats, the loudest, vests and most striking checked suits, of all those who toyed with ivory, cubes or sat in with a party o£ five or, six in games of chance, or graced the, dealer’s side of a faro bank. He lived, in a comfortable and luxuriantly fur, nished log cabin, the logs of which, were nainted alternately in red, white, and blue and on either side of the high, pitched roof was painted a mammoth, shamrock and harp. But\'most prized, of his possessions was the largest gold, nugget chain ever made . in Alaska., The oldtimers could always tell when, dice and cards had not been faithful, to Pat, for on such occasions the watch, chain was given into the care of “Mon, ey King” Keeler in exchange for a roll, and it was Pat’s boast that never did, a roll acquired in that way fail to mul, tiply, sq he usually wore the chain., One of Pat\'s ways of expressing ulti, mate esteem for one wras to have made, a photograph of the friend wearing this, famous chain on his vest. After the, death of Pat the chain was sold, and, finally it became the property of the, Nugget Shop in Juneau, where it was, used for a window advertising pur, poses until it attracted the attention, and interest of Mrs. Dohenv., Another souvenir which Mrs. Dohenv, esteems highly is a large Chilkat blan, ket of soft blue and crome coloring,, made of long hair and of the finest, Chilkat native workmanship., REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT OF, VINCENT RICHARDS ON COURTS, -ui “international action-graph" of young Vincent Hichards, the Yonkers, youth whose remarkable achievements on the courts have been the topic of, much discussion wherever tennis is played.

Of the 1921 crop 375,000, boxes were shipped by boat and in, 1919 only 2,000 boxes were handled, over Seattle docks. The Washington, state production of apples this year, will be only a little less than last, year when approximately a third of, the commercial apples of the United, States were, grown in this state., A surprising development in the, apple industry is the rapid increase, in the movement of this fruit on re, frigerated boats. Until the last, few, years all the apples, peaches, straw, berries and other fruits sent to out, side markets moved on trains., Last year when the railroads were, hard pressed to furnigh refrigerated, space for the movement of 32,541, carloads of Washington apples, the, growers took advantage of the public, cold storage space, enough for 20,, 000 tpns here and this year have con, tracted to ship at least three times, as much through the local public, terminals. Recently an intercoastal, steamship with refrigeration left, for the Atlantic seaboard with ap, ples pears, peaches, loganberries,, and strawberrie spacked in sugar rein, deer meat from Alaska, frozen fish,, eggs ami poultry. Enroute south the, vessel picked up California citrus, fruits and other perishable products, from the Golden State. Formerly, all this tonnage moved to New York,, Boston, Philadelphia and other cent, ersvby train., DO ANIMALS, HAVE LIFE, AFTERDEATH?, “Why should the spirit of mortal be, proud?” Why should man be so vain, as to think that he alone, out of all the, . myriadp of created forms of life, is, endowed with the attributes of im, mortality?

I have asked, myself if virtues like these, in any, form of life, must forever perish with, the bodies in which they dwell?, I cannot believe it., NOTED BRITISHERS WILL, VISIT UNITED STATES, LONDON, Aug. 24.—Representatives, of the British Branch of the Sulgrave, Institution will leave England on Sep, tember 2 to visit the United States to, be present when President Harding, unveils in Washington a statue of Ed, mund Burke., Members of the British delegation, will include Sir Charles Wakefield, ex, lord mayor of London; Lady Wake, fielr, Sir Arthur and Lady Haworth,, Sir William Letts, Harold Spender, and H.

Through this bu, reau detailed daily statements regarding. the, movement of trains, the percentage of effec, tiveness of the walkout and the condition of, equipment have been furnished the daily, press., On the other side the railway executives, have maintained an information bureau whose, duty it has been to show that train service has, not been impaired, that new employes daily, are being taken on in the shops and that the, railroads are getting along very nicely, thank, you. without the assistance of their ertswliile, employes, now on strike., Obviously, the reports of the rival camps, were expected to be at wide variance, and, there was no failure of. either side to live up, to expectations fully., The ammunition of both has consisted large, ly of repudiations and denials, each of the, other., The much-wooed public, as a natural con, sequence, has been obliged to employ its dis, criminatory faculties to an unusual degree in, order to prevent itself from being mentally, yanked hither and yon in an effort to pursue, a happy middle path in forming its opinions., LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM A NECESSITY, One of the weaknesses of the last legisla, ture arose from the fact that its members, came to the session without any program., No platform had been promulgated by either, party or any candidate in advance of the elec, tion, and it soon became evident that they, were here because they were here, and that, was all there was to it. This should not be per, mitted to occur again., When a person becomes a candidate for . a, legislative office it must be presumed that he, has something in mind which he has an am, bition to accomplish—some measure he de, sires to enact into a law., To assume that a man of intelligence wants, a legislative office just for the purpose of, drawing the small salary attached to it is a, reflection on the motives of\'the average^ am, bitious candidate., What is it that has impelled the present, candidates of the respective parties to seek, election? What is it they wish to accomplish,, for the good of the people?, The electors wish to know and have a right, to know. . ••, It is time that various candidates promul, gated their legislative program., Under the old convention system the conven, tion prepared the platform. Under the new, system of nominations the candidates selected, became the spokesmen of the party. They are, presumably elected because they represent the, party principles and party policies. As such it, becomes their duty to speak for the party. If, they do not agree, each will have to speak for, himself, for each must have some idea why he, wants the office. *, The democrats put forth few candidates be, cause the democratic party has ceased to have, any policy., The republican party, after a contest,, placed in the field a full list of candidates be, cause that party has a will and a purpose., Those candidates chosen to carry out that pur, pose should publicly announce it so it may be, known to the electors., This means that there is no reason why the, party candidates should not get together and, agree on a legislative program, otherwise call, ?d a platform., If they fail in this they may fail at the next, session of the legislature and their election, will possibly- have been a^ waste of time or, something worse.—Juneau Capital., FEAR A PRODUCT OF CULTURE, What soft-nosed bullet ever got a groan out, of a grizzly, or a whimper out of a wolf? What, desert beast or bird or insect makes a cry, when brought face to face with death?, As for man, the mighty destroyer, when, danger or pain comes his way he can give, forth a cry that is blood-curdling—the most, terror-stricken cry of any animal in the king, dom., The cry of the human becomes more in, tense, more fear-laden, more soul-peircing, as, you come nearer to the higher and more re, fined strata of civilization. The Indian in war, fare, in torture, .in death, makes no sound; his, lips are sealed and his face is immobile., How does it happen that the. life of the, open accepts the order of this so unprotesting, and goes its way to death without a sound,, while the life of the city shudders and screams, at the bare prospect? Is not each, in measure,, the product of its environment and has not, each been fashioned by its surroundings?, Had man always lived in the open, and main, tained a healthy animalism, he would per, haps have been better advised. He was born, and equipped as an excellent animal, but In1,, sold his birthright for a mess of pottage called, culture and took on fear and a whimper as a, part of the bargain.—John C. Van Dyke in, “The Open Spaces.” ’, “CHECHAKO”, A tourist of the North, writing in\'the In, dianapolis News, contributes the following;, “Checliawko is the Indian name for newcom, er but it means literally one who has not seen, the ice come and go. All newcomers are Clie, chawkos until they qualify by this rule where, upon they become Sourdoughs.”, Incorrect. “Chechako” is not an Indian, word at all. It comes from the Chinook, a very, convenient jargon arranged a century or so, ago, chiefly by Jesuit missionaries and Hud, son’s Bay factors in the “Oregon country”, as a means of conversation between Indians, and whites and different tribes of Indians., “Chechako” is a combination of two Chi, nook words—“die,” new, and “chako,” come,, meaning literally “new come.” Chinook is not, generally used in Alaska by Indians or whites,, so “chechako,” like many other things in the, North, was imported.—Juneau Empire., Putting the presidential foot down on gen, eral amnesty for “political” prisoners will, meet with general approval, foes of the na, tion to the contrary.—Marion Star., Things We Think, When a big man is “cocky” he makes others •mad,” but, a “cocky” little man only makes the.m laugh., * * *, There isn’t much “Safety in numbers” when the numbers, are all against you., • * *\', Those who strive constantly to get as much as they, can for as little as they can give, end up by getting as little, as the others can give., • * *, When you get something for nothing that’s what it is, worth., * • «, The proverbial “rainy day” sometimes quenches the fires, of genius., * * •, The man who boasts that he "speaks his mind," usually, doesn’t have much need of a long conversation., * * *, Cockiness is next to ungodliness., • • «, • . • • t ■, When you betray a confidence you betray yourself., OFFICE CAT, TRADE MARK, BY JUNIUS I, .

SCOTT C. BONE, Governor of Alaska, Popular conception about Alaska, has has done this Territory infinite, harm. Intensive campaigns of educa, tion, conducted more or less system, atically for years, have not, unhap, pily, dispelled and eradicated untruths, and misinformation implanted in the, public mind fifty-five years ago when, William H. Seward consummated the, remarkable purchase from Russia., Alaska was then called “Seward’s, Iceberg” and in the mind’s eye it has, . since so remained., Vilhdalmur Stefansson, college-bred,, in an illuminating discussion of “The, North That .Never Was,” give\'s ap, proval to the idea of a Cambridge, preacher that the country needs a Na, tional University of Polite Unlearning., Stefansson himself would fit into the, Alaskan chair of the institution. Or,, equally so, Dr. Alfred Brooks, the, eminent geologist, or Major J. C. Got, wals, practical road builder, who has, mushed the Territory over and knows, it from A to Z., Sitka has a Pioneers’ \'Home filled, with aged prospectors, many of them, of Klondike days, who likewise could, contribute enlightenedly, if not po, litely, to the curriculem of such a uni, versity. They know Alaska for hav, ing roughed it in quest of gold and for, having their roseate dreams of early, pioneering days unrealized at the end, of the long, long trail ., Nothing could possibly benetit Alas, ka more than to have the American, people unlearn what they have errone, ously learned this last half a century., Prevailing ignorance of the Territory, Is dense and- overwhelming. Five out, of six people I met in Washington, on, my recent official visit, including our, national law makers, uniformly ex, pressed surprise that I was able to get, out of Alaska in the winter season and, marvelled how I was to return to my, post of duty until the ice went out., I was kept busy explaining that the, ports of Alaska, save those in the, northernmost Arctic regions, were, open the year around. I was asked, whether the Government Railroad, reached Sitka and touched Nome! It1, was taken for granted that it extend, ed to Juneau. Similar inquiries,, equally absurd and amusing, if not so, annoying, impressed upon me the, paramount need of the spread of the, truth about this wonderful northland., It is a deep disappointment to me,, as I am sure it is to all Alaskans, that, President Harding, owing to the pro, longed session of Congress, is unable, -to carry out his plans to visit Alaska, this season. He had- his heart set, upon coming, and Mrs. Harding, too., They looked forward to such a visit, with consuming and enthusiastic in, terest. It would have meant not only, an experience of a life time to them,, but incalculable benefit to Alaska., World attention would have been cen, tered upon this Territory as never be, fore. A large corps of newspaper and, magazine writers, photographers and, motion picture artists would have, come along and Alaska thus would, have received exploitation and adver, tising wdiieh would have been of last, ing advantage., But the Presidential trip is not, abandoned—only deterred. The year, of our Lord, 1923, if not 1922, will be, made historically memorable by such, a visit. The present administration, will not come to a close without the, President familiarizing • himself at, first hand with Alaska, and Alaska s, needs. Therefore, let the stout, hearted people of this vast domain, continue to be strong of faith. As in, the past, let not hope deferred serve, to make the heart sick. For time out, of mind Alaska has waited and wait, ed and encountered obstacles and de, lays, and practiced patience supreme ,,, but, optimistic, I confidently believe, and predict that the dawn of a new, and brighter and better era is ap, proaching this vast domain, and that, ■the turn toward grpwth and prosper, ity and development is close at hand., Twenty years ago, in a speech de, livered at Seattle. Theodore Roosevelt, sanguinely prophesied that within the, lives of his generation Alaska would, become peopled and thrive as the, Scandinavian countries have thrived., Adverse things have happened in the, two decades intervening and instead, of growth a loss of population has, deplorably been recorded. But, as in, the case of the President’s visit, the, fulfilment of that prophecy is not, abandoned—only deferred., Surely Alaska will make great, strides before the next census is, taken and ultimately—and in the not, distant future—add bright stars to, Old Glory, and join the Sisterhood of, States!, This dream of ours assuredly is des, tined to come true., From the moment I took the oath of, office as Governor I have appreciated, fully the honor of being the adminis, trative head of this wonderland, so, rich in resources and so potent with, possibilities. It can and will contri, bute materially to the strength of the, union.. But I realized when I assumed, my official duties and realize more, fully- after a year\' of service that, there is no enduring honor in being, Governor of Alaska unless I can ac, complish something worth while for, the people of Alaska and aid sub, stantially in bringing the Territory, into its own. To this task and under, taking I am committed unreservedly, and giving the best that is in me to, attain the desired ends and hasten the, re-birth of a newer and greater, Alaska., I crave the support and co-operation, of all Alaskans—- the brave spirits, who hdve survived the ups and downs, of a country beset with natural diffi, culties and unknown and misunder, stood by the world at large—and be, speak continued faith and courage and, a pulling together to speed the trans, formation so long delayed., Alaska is not a monumental iceberg, or glacier. It is not snowbound and, in the grip of bitter, biting elements., It is not cut off from the world. Its, climate on the coast is generally mild, and equable, with much rainfall, but, comparable to the climate of Portland, and Seattle. Blizzards such as rage, in Minnesota, the Dakotas and Mon, tana and occasionally in New York, and the East are sometimes experi, enced in the northernmost part of the, Territory, but are uncommon, if not, unknown, to coastal Alaska and Alas, ka as a whole., Millions of people live happily and, thrive in Norway and Sweden and in, sections of our own country under, climatic conditions n’o more favorable,, if not more severe, than the general, climatic conditions of Alaska., Alaska’s summers are ideally pleas, ant and delightful on the coast and, gloriously bright and beautiful and, often hot in the interior. Tempera, ture ranging from 80 to 90 degress is, frequently encountered in the Arctic, Circle. Throughout the Territory, flowers and berries grow in profu, sion. Long days and warm sunshine, give sturdy growth to plant life. Fair, banks is a veritable floral bower in, June, July and August., The midnight sun on the Yukon is, worth traveling thousands of miles to, see, especially when it illuminates Mt., McKinley, the towering peak of the, American continent. So, likewise, the, aurora borealis, with its columns of, dancing lights, which may be seen in, Alaska in more magnificent display, than anywhere else in the world., Alaska possesses 100,000 square, miles of agricultural lands and today, numbers hundreds of occupied\' home, steads under successful cultivation., Farm products of the estimated value, of $250,000 were grown and sold in, the Tanana Valley alone the past, season. Year after year there is in, creasing cultivation., .Talking through The Churchman,, an Alaskan publication, I am aware, that these facts and others equally,, striking are well known to Alaskan, readers. But it is with the thought, that through this splendid medium, people not so well informed will na, turally be reached that the facts, qre chronicled anew here., Comparatively few people know, Alaska. Fe^ver still comprehend it in, all its greatness. Alaskans them, selves, in major number, have seen, little of Alaska. Eight out of ten of, them have glimpsed only small\' sec, tions of the Terirtory. The tourist, who visits these shores is over, whelmed with the scenic beauties pre, sented to the eye on every sid\'e, from, Dixon’s Entrance through the pano, ramic Inside Passage to Skagway at, the head - of Lynn Canal and, per, chance, on over the White Pass, in the, Yukon Territory, to Whitehorse. But,, if his journey .ends there, he does, not know Alaska. He has seen 6nly, the beginning of Alaska. Alaska lies, beyond., As well may the tourist who sails, along the Virginia and Jersey coasts, and takes a Fall River steamer to, Boston and then proceeds to Portland,, or Montreal, by water, returning over, land to New York and ending his, grand tour there, profess to know, the United States. He has seen a, great but a very limited section of the, vast country that makes up the Union., The United States lies beyond., The magnitude of Alaska, 600,000, square miles, precludes in the un, opened stage of the Territory the pos, siblity of a general and Intimate, knowledge of Alaska., In conclusion, a few words about the, system of government in Alaska:, I do not believe in the system. I, do not know of the successful opera, tion of such a system anywhere on, earth. Bureaucratic government is in, efficient, cumbersome, retarding and, positively unworkable. Divided au, thority and responsibility inevitably, makes for confusion and mal-adminis, tration. I criticise no bureau, but give, friendly and full recognition to the ex, pert and technical equipment of the, average bureau. These governmental, agencies undoubtedly have done good, work and certainly a just meed of, praise is not to be withheld. But the, system is chaottic and indefensible., It was never meant that such bu, reaus should exercise administrative, powers and governmental functions., It is a system that cannot- last and, statesmen in Washington, in due time, now, will provide a more business-like, substitute, with a co-ordination and, centralization of authority and re, sponsibility, and with the administra, tion of Alaskan affairs brought, closer home to Alaska and made more, efficient and productive of results., Finally, it is a pleasure to me to, commend the splendid work done in, the missionary fields of Alaska. It, has my warm interest and can\' ever, command my helpful aid. The natives,, who form nearly one-half the popula, tion, are entitled to and should re, ceive, generously, all possible assist, ance, spiritually and otherwise, and, thus improve their lot and make bet, ter inhabitants of them.—The Alas, kan Churchman., HUSBAND’S STORY WILL, AMAZE CORDOVA CITIZENS, He say.s: “Adler-i-ka helped my, wife for gas on the stomach and sour, Stomach ih TWENTY MINUTES.
