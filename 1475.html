Whitehead ji\n(J |\nJed Wheeler, aged forty and a bache\nlor. was as well lik*d as any person\nin the village of Flint He was neigh\nborly. kind hearted and always willing\nto do for others.\nJed’s good qualities were in away\nhis enemies. He was lazy, and. added\nto Ids laziness, he had a mania for\ntrading. He would trade horses, dogs,\nguns, watches, overcoat or anything\nelse, and it so happened that the other\nfellow always got the best of the bar\ngain.\nHe had been left quite a little for\ntune by his grandmother, hut in the\ncourse of five years lie had sold at a\nloss or traded with sharpers until all\nthat was left to him was a ten acre lot\nlying just outside the village limits.\nIt was as fine a meadow as could he\nfound in the county, and Jed was hang\ning on to that until some lightning rod\nman should come along and trade him\na farm on top the Rocky mountains\nwhen he fell in love.\nJim Thomas, the carpenter, had died\nthree years before and left a level\nheaded, economical widow behind him.\nShe was an old schoolmate of Jed’s,\nand la* had seen her almost every day\nfor twenty-five years, and until the\nspirit of love bubbled up he had sim\nply regarded her as he looked upon all 1\nother women.\nHe was sitting on the grocery steps\none day whittling when his knife slip \'\npeil and out his finer. The Widow\nT homas was Just entering the store for\nhalf a dozen eggs when the accident\noccurred, and she pulled out her hand\nkerchief and hound up the bleeding\nfinger. It was only a trifle, but some\nhow it tom bed the heart of the old\nbachelor, and three days later he railed\non the widow.\n“Martha,” he began, “I’ve got tired\nof sloshing around alone and am going\nto get married." *\n"For the land’s sake!” she exclaimed\n“That is, if tin* woman 1 want will\nhave me.” \'\n“Who is it ?”\n"You.” 1\n“Now. Jed, don’t come around here\nwith any of your nonsense." she said.\n“You are a good natured man. but you\nare lazy. You think you’ve got brains, i ;\nbut everybody beats you. It would 1\ndrive me crazy to have such a bus i\nhand.”\n“I coul 1 and would reform. If 1 had\nany one to peck at me I’d go to work.” 1\nI haven\'t time to he poking up a\nhusband. It’s hard to teach old dogs <\nnew tricks. Thank ye tor the honor.\nJed, hut I guess we won’t do any mar- <\nrying.”\nJed was crushed for three days, dur\ning which time a windmill man came \' .\nalong and offered to trade him o.noo\nacres of desert land in Arizona for his\nmeadow and explained that he could\nraise lo.t m rattlesnakes to the acre on\nthe sandy soil and sell tin* oil for S.Y a\ngallon to grease the feet of babies\nwith.\nIf Jed had been in his normal condi\ntion lie woul l have closed w i: 1 * the of\nfer at once, but as lu* was in tin* throes\nof hopeless love lu* astonished the\ntown by turning the windmill man !\ndown. Two days later In* went back\nto the widow and said:\n“Martha. 1 had a dream about Jim\nlast night. 1 dreamed that 1 met him\nIn front of the blacksmith shop and\nthat we shook hands and in* said he j\nhoped I\'d marry you."\n“oh. you’ve come about that, have\nyou V" • In* asked. (\n“1 have. I\'m a miserable man.”\n“Have you tried catnip tea?”\n“Catnip tea? Great heavens! What\nnils me is love, and if tin* Mississippi\nriver was composed of catnip tea it ,\ncouldn’t cure me. Martha, if you won’t\npromise to have me 1 can’t live a week\nlonger.”\n“Nonsense. I’m busy with my iron\ning. and yon run along.”\nJed was now so broken up that ev\nerybody began to notice and comment\non it, but when questioned In* simply\nshook his head and Intimated that he\nwas not long for this sinful world. He\ngt up energy enough, however, to\ncontract to get out a thousand ties for\na suburban electric line, and, hoping\nthis might work in his favor, In* paid\nanother visit to the widow and told\ntier of It.\n“Now that you set* l am going to\nwork, can’t you say yes?” he asked in\ni oncluslon.\n“Jed. what do you come bothering\nfor?” sin* asked.\n“Because I love you.”\n•\'Don’t he silly. I’m making mince\npies today and haven’t time to argue.”\nJed went away, determined to throw\nhimself into tin* mill pond, but when he\nreached the hank lu* met a stranger\nwho had been poking around the vil\nlage for a couple of days without tell\ning any one his business. lie intro\nduced himself find said that bethought\nsome of establishing an orphan asylum\nif he could find a site to suit. In this\nway he brought the talk around to\nJeil’s meadow. The value of the land\nas it lay was sino ail acre, though Jed\nbad never had a cash offer for it.\nThe stranger didn\'t exhibit too great\nInterest in the matter. He said he’d\nthink the matter over and perhaps\nmake an offer. lie had no mountains\nin Idaho and no lakes in Europe to\ntrade, but would In* prepared to pay\ncash. A day later, while still saunter\ning nround, he met Jed and said that\nbe could have sl,<nmi for the land as\nsoon as the deed was made out. The\nlovelorn bachelor had started for the\noffice of the village lawyer to have the\ndeed made out when he met the Wid\now Thomas. She noti*cJ his excite\nment and asked the can so. and when\nhe had told her she said:\n“Look here, Jed. don\'t von take too\nmuch stiH*k In the orphan business.”\n“Ilow do you mean?”\n“You’re an orphan yourself, and you\ndon’t want to let any oilier orphan get\nthe better of you. Can y m get a horse\nand buggy anywhere for an hour?"\n"Of course.”\n“Then let’s drive out to your land\nand see what kind of a place it would\nmake for the poor orphans.”\nOn the way out Jed recurred to the\nold subject, saying that he was on his\nway t drown himself when he met\nthe stranger.\n“Come, now.” interrupted the widow,\n“this is straight business and you keep\nquiet.”\nWhen the meadow, which lay along\nthe highway, was reached the widow\ninsisted on walking across it from\nnorth to south. The ground looked as\nlevel as a tl or. but near the center was\na sort of sink hole. In rainy weather\nconsiderable water stood there, but the\nearth was now dry.\n“Fm!” said the widow as she halted\nand sniffed.\n“Do you mean that smell?”\n“Yes. Ever notice it before?”\n“Dina* nr twice. Smells as if some\nbody bad been breaking rotten eggs\naround here.”\n“Get a pole and thrust it into the\nground as far as you can.”\n"Here\'s one right here, and some\nbody’s been piking. Whit do you\nmake of it. Mar lia ?”\n“Jed. you\'ve ask** I me to marry you,”\nshe said in rop!y.\n“1 have, but >on don\'t seem to care\nwhether you drive me to a suicide’s\ngrave or not.”\n“I don’t know but I’d be willing to\ntake chances."\n“As how?”\n“If you’ll deel me this land today\nI’ll promise to marry you within a\nmonth. 1 shan\'t answer any questions.\nIt’s yes or no right off."\n“Tin\'ll it\'s yes. by thunder!" exclaim\ned Jed as he reached tin* roadside\nfence.\nThe deed was made out before sun\ndown and sent away to the county scat\nto be reeorded. Next day the man\nwho was looking for an asylum site\ncalled upon the Widow Thomas. He\nhad scarcely mentioned the poor or\nphans when she laughed and said:\n“Don\'t let your philanthropy cause\nyou to lose a good thing The ground\nup there \\< full of natural gas. and\nyou know it. It\'s only twenty miles\nto pipe it to Chicago. If it’s under the\nmeadow, then it’s under hundreds of\nacres around here. Go ahead and\nmake any test you will and then come\nhack with your offer."\nA week later he was willing to hand\nover $ in.non in cash, and when Jed\nWheeler had seen the money •• muted\nout and the deed passed he exclaimed:\n“By thunder. Martha, but that was\nthe only piece of land I bad. and when\na piano feller comes along and wants\nto trade me a goose farm for the rais\nlug of speckled geese, what am I go\ning t ) say to him?”\n“Refer him to y >ur wifi*." she an\nswered as she kissed him for the lirst\ntime.\nA Tmwily I Itln*.\nHere is a story of Se itch sailormen\ntold by the Dundee Advertiser: “The\nship’s crew had been made tip in a\nhurry, and when they lmd passed the\nbar and were beginning to feel a trilie\nhungry it was discovered that they\nhad no cook. So the old man asked\nGeordie to try his hand at the job, and\nGeonlie scratched his head and rubbed\nhis chin and said lu* would do his best.\nNext morning lie consulted Jack about\nbreakfast. *Oh.’ said Jack, ‘rice will\ndo!’ ’Will it. d’ye think?’ said Geordie.\n*Noo, about how much shall I cook?’\n‘Let’s see.* replied Jack ‘There’s four\nteen of us with the old man. 1 should\nsay a bucketful would be plenty.’ ‘I\ndoot but it will,’ said Geordie and went\noff to tin* galley, lie gt a bucketful of\nrice and put it in a large pot, and\nwhen it began to boil it likewise began\nto swell. So lu* baled out a portion in\nto another pot, and that also did like\nwise. Then he haled out of both pots\ninto other pots until all his pots were\nfull. Still it swelled, and Geordie be\ncame alarmed. So lie put on all the\nlids and lashed them tightly down.\nThen he went forth and locked the\ndoor and stood against tin* bulwarks\nwatching it. Soon tin* skipper came\nalong and made inquiries regarding\nbreakfast. ‘Whist, man!’ replied Geor\ndie softly. ‘l\'m cooking rice, and I\ndon’t know the minit it will burst the\nt’.oor.’ ”\nOrigin of "Fentlier In III* Cnp."\n“A feather in his cap,” signifying\nhonor and distinction, arose from a\ncustom which was common among the\nSyrians and perpetuated to this day\namong the various semicivilized people\nof adding a new feather to tin* head\ngear for every enemy slain. In the\ndays of chivalry the embryo knight re\nceived his cocque in a featherless con\ndition. and then won his plumes as he\nhad won his spurs. In a manuscript\nwritten by Richard Hansard in 1588\nand carefully preserved in the British\nmuseum is mentioned an ancient Hun\ngarian custom, that of allowing no\nman to wear a feather in his cap who\nbail not killed a Turk. The Hungar\nians had a law, which was in vogue\nas late as U\'l2, which allowed warriors\nto add a feather to tiieir headdress col\nlection “every time tin* claimant could\nprove that he had succored a starving\nHungarian or had killed an ablehodied\nTurk or other Moslem.” These old cus\ntoms are now obsolete, hut it is Inter\nesting to know that there were once\nfilch laws upon the statute hooks of\ntuitions thought to Ik* civilized.\n!

At home a\nbed should be prepared for them, plac\ned where the plants may have some\nprobation from the hot sun and be wa\ntered regularly. The soil should be\nthoroughly enriched with well rotted\nmanure or some commereial fertilizer.\nIt is best to plant the wild flowers as\na border, with all varieties mixed, as\nmost of them are perennials, and it\nwill be unnecessary to replant the bor\nder yearly except to replace those that\ndie. Owing to the different flowering\nseasons of the several varieties, if the\nbed is well furnished with many sorts\nthere will be a constant succession of\nbloom all the summer.\nIt is best to begin working the\nground for the bed as soon in the\nspring as if is dry enough. The trans\nplanted flowers should be carefully and\nregularly watered until they are well\nestablished. Afterward it is only nec\nessary to keep the weeds out. The\nseeds of many of the best wild flowers\ncan be purchased of the seedsmen.\n>• I*ink Se<ll inir Hone.\nA new pink seedling rose originated\nfrom Liberty and Alice Itoosevelt is\non exhibition by a Washington florist,\nand a writer in hardening says of it:\n1 venture the prediction that even in\nthis day of rapid multiplication of new\nvarieties this rose will create a sensa\ntion among fanciers.

May 20, Pmh\nTo the Mimn*\' Joi kn m,.\nPlease give me space in your paper to\nmake a few remarks in behalf of Col.\n• Pearre, whom the Cumberland Daily\nY, n < is trying to convince the voters of\nthis county is receiving more revenue\nfrom his party than he is entitled to.\nIn reply to such statements l wish to\nsay that if the friends of the Daily AYa.s\nhad proved as loyal to the republican\nparty as Col. Pearre, they, too, would\nprobably Ik* receiving some of the\n1 revenue that all loyal republicans are\nentitled to.\nBut they don’t tell tin* people what\nrevenue the late Governor received, nor\nwhat Senator Wellington lias received\n• for four years as sub*treasurer, two\n. years in Congress, and six years as\nUnited State Senator. One hundred\nthousand dollars would be a small esti\nmate of what the latter has received\nwhile in public office, and yet how little\n, appreciation in return he showed for his\nparty. He took the stump against Hon.\nWilliam McKinley, and is answerable\nfor many other acts which stand to his\nparty discredit.\nAnd it is other such by-gone politicians\nas the Senator, Anthony Reese, William\nG. Miller, A. A Douh, James M. Sloan.\nMarx Wiueland E H. B. Prichard and\ni Otto Hulling, all of whom have been\nblessed by the republican party, and\nsince it has come to pass that the party\nhas gotten tired of them and voted them\nout of office, they have become party\nkickers. Whatever their in eutious,\nthey have sown discord in the republican\nranks by. using every pretext to defeat\n, Col. Pearre, a man who has always\nstood loyally by iiis party, whether its\nnominees were to his persoual liking or\nnot.\nThe republican party had its birth in\nfreedom; its founders were the plain\npeople of the country, in whose hearts\nburned brightly tin* fires of liberty. It\n’ has ever stood for the prosperity of tlie\nwhole people, and not for the favored\nj few.\nThe republican policy of recognition\n. j for worth wherever found gave us\n; Sumner from the schools, Lincoln from\n, j the farm. Grant from the tanner’s liench\nand \\\\ illiam McKinley from the ranks\nof the toilers.\nIt is to perpetuate these developments,\nwhich have made the republican party\nthe paragon of all [Hditical organizations,\nthat it exists to-day.\nTherefore, wi> call upon the manhood\not the republican party of Allegany\ncounty to rise and put aside those who\nhave defeated republicans, or aided their\nelection only when they were to he\nprivately benefitted.\nDo the prospects seem bright for Lloyd\nLowndes to secure the nomination when\nFrederick count \\ has declared itself al\nmost unanimous for Col.

ID?\nhad been touring all summer through\nN*-a England and had had a ehanee to\ng-*t in idea of where the best roads for\niiioTnriMK were located. His retmirks\non the subject are worth serious eon\nei . n not alone hy antomobillsts, hut\nhy legislators as well.\n"in Masaehnsetts there is a system\nof i • ids that is not surpassed in Amer\nica. ” he said, "and that state gets the\nbenefit from the tine highways in more\nways than one. It is a paying invest*\nn.- nt. Any person who has ever travel\ned through the state in a motor ear\nfinds tin* riding so comfortable that he\nw ishes to repeat the trip.\n"Not only that, but he prolongs his\nstay in the state to take advantage of\nthe line driving. Ordinarily accom\npanied hy two or three others, this\nnmans an expenditure for living ex\npenses that brings money into places\nin the state where before there was no\nsu< h revenue.\n"No one city has a monopoly on this,\nfor many of the smaller towns have\nhad strangers within their portals who\nnever Would have been seen there but\nfor the roads that led them whither\nthey did not care. When they have lost\nthe way in going from one city to an\nother instead of displeasure at making\na mistake the delightful places that\npresented themselves here and there,\ncoupled with the well kept roads, add\ned a zest to the trip.\n“We hear a lot about the beauties of\nthis region or that one and plan to\nI\'LEASt’ItK OF AUTOMOIIILINO ON A GOOD\nKOAl>.\nmake a trip to see what the places are\nlike. \\Ye see them, to be sure, but the\ndisc mforts experienced in making the\njourney often take away much of the\npleasure that otherwise might have\nbeen enjoyed.\n“If Newhampshire, for instance, had\na system of mads any when* near like\nthat of .Massachusetts what a paradise\nit would he for the motorists! Some\n•lay the situation may he realized by\ntin* pe iplc of that state and something\ndone to help the matter, hut It looks\nas if it were a long way off.\n“1\' r example, there are roads in the\nnorthern part of the state where the\nscenery is simply magnificent that\ncould be put in fair shape for a few\ndollar.\'. 1 know of places where the\nexpenditure of a couple of dollars a\n•lay by a town t > till up holes and level\nroads would in a week or two make\nthe highways 5b per cent better.\n"At present they are abominable in\nsome places. When you find you have\nto run a ear at six or seven miles and\nr.t times slow d iwn to tin* point that\njust divides between actually stopping\nand barely moving because of gulhes\nand holes, when the road is perfectly\nlevel, t >o, for some miles, then some\nidea of tin* discomforts of motoring\nthereabouts may la* gleaned.”\nd he writer within a few weeks trav\neled over a number of such roads and\nfound the conditions were not at all ex\naggerated. It did seem like practiced\nnegligence to allow the highways to re\nmain in that shape. It is not to be ex\npected that every town should set\nabout making the roads within its\nboundaries as hard and smooth as a\nracing track, yet no valid reason ex\nists for letting them grow worse each\nweek, for in the end, when repairs are\nImperative, the cost is all tin* greater.\nAnd what is true of one state is appli\ncable to others, Massachusetts except\ned.\nC*on\\iet l.alior on Washington Itouris.\n\'l ia* state of Washington is planning\nto use convict labor in highway con\nst ruction during the ensuing season,\nand the proposition is in the form of\nan agreement hy which the state is to\nlupply the convicts, together with the\nnecessary guards, and pay for their\ntransportation to and from the peni\ntentiary. The county sustains the cost\nof their hoard, housing and medical\nc are and the expense of transportation\nfrom point to point within the county\nmid to supply superintendent, tools and\nmaterial, says the* (load Hoads Maga\nzine. The county Is also to keep an ac\ncount of all material produced or han\ndled by the convicts, and tills cost is to\nbe* the basis of settlement with the\nState.\nMuKliik the Hoad Attractive.\nIn the* construction of a road the\nwork of beautifying tin* sides of the\nhighway shoujd not be* neglected, says\ntin* Pittsbml* Press. Flowers, shrub\nbery and trees should each have a\nplace along the roadside. They refresh\nthe eye and cultivate a love for the\nbeautiful in nature, making a trip over\ntin* road a pleasure to lu* remembered.\nThe* appearance of the roadside is gen\nerally a pretty good Index to the char\nacter of tin* owner of the promises.

At\nlast the Federal commander determin\ned to exterminate the rangers and, with\nthat end in view, sent out a picked\ncorps of mounted men. eager to meet\nand capture an enemy who boasted\nthat he could not lie taken. It was\nearly in the morning of a warm Sep\nteinber day when the men in blue\nfound their quarry, coming on them\nsuddenly at the foot of a hill.\nFor a moment there was a brisk rain\nof bullets. Several of tin* men on both\nsides threw up their arms and fell in\nthe dust, while their foaming, riderless\nsteeds dashed madly down the pike.\nThen the Confederates broke and tied,\nwith tin* yelling Yankees close at their\nheels.\nAt last a stream was reached, and\nhere the Fnion men succeeded In cap\nturing several Confederates, but not\nthe leader. lie was a small, wiry man,\nwith a frame as strong and tough as\nsteel, one who did not know what fear\nor defeat meant, and In* plunged his\nanimal into the water, lifted his sword\nhigh above his head and safely climbed\nup the opposite bank amid a shower of\nbullets, accompanied by a shout of ad\nmiration from the astonished enemy.\nIn a moment he was out of sight be\nhind the hills.\nAbout a quarter of a mile down the\nroad was a farmhouse, in the sitting\nroom of which a girl sat peeling\nfruit. The door was open, and just as\nI\nit /)\n__\nHi: SLU i l 1> INSIDE THE CLOCK.\nthe girl raided her eyes a horse raced\ninto the yard, with its tlanks reeking\nwith water ami the rider wet from the\ntip of his plumed hat to the soles of his\ncavalry boots.\nThe man roue into the barnyard and\nleft Ills steed in the stall, then ran into\ntin* house. At that moment the head\nof tin* Federal column came over the\nhill on the gallop. The Confederate\nsaw the line of blue uniforms, the sun\nHashing on the sabers, and with a hur\nried glance around In* sprang to his\nfeet and ran to the corner, in which\nstood an old “grandfather’s clock.” In\na moment In* had opened tin* door and\nslipped inside, and by the time he had\nclosed it again tin* Fnion men were\ntroopin into the house.\nThey began a thorough search of tin*\nhouse from garret to cellar, but not a\ntrace of the man could they tind. The\nhods were torn t> bits, the pantries ex\nplored. every closet upset and no nook\nor corner of the place left uninvesti\ngated. but to no purpose. Then the\nbarn was given a tool overhauling,\nand. thou h they found tin* wet and\nsaddled horse, there was no trace of\nthe rider At list all tin* Fnion men\ncollected in th • sitting room where the\nyoung lady sat quietly watching the\nproceedings and still busy in her house\nhold duty of p:v*; ring tin* fruit. They\nwere nonplused a: l could not imagiiu\nwhat had become of tin* fugitive.\nNow. it happened that the old clock\nwas not running, but had been broken\nfor some time and was full of dust,\nwhich the entrance of the ranger had\ndisturbed. In fact, he was in a great\npredicament. The dust had tilled his\nnostrils, and In* felt creep over him the\nhorrible sensation of a coming sneeze.\nA sneeze meant capture, perhaps death,\nbut the sneeze had to come.\nA bright thought dashed Into the\nConfederate\'s mind, and with a quick\nmotion of his hand he set the old\nwheels in a whirl, and the rusty gong\nsounded a sonorous chime. In the cov\ner of the noise the sneeze was born,\nbut it was not heard. However, the\nsudden waking of the old clock excited\nsuspicious, and, with a glance of in\nquiry. tin* federal oflicer moved toward\nit. The girl was quick to take in the\nsituation. With a fretful air she ex\nclaimed:\n"There goes that old clock again. It\nmust really be fixed, for it is so annoy\ning." And the officer, changing his\nmind, took no more notice of the oc\ncurrence. In a few moments the house\nwas deserted and the troops had pass\ned away in the direction of their\ncamps, leaving the rebel to come out\nfrom Ids hiding place a sight to behold.\nThe wet clothes were full of dust and\nhis face gray with the water and mud\nwhich covered it, but he was a very\nhappy man.
