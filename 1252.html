The ;\nWilson bill bore the name of the j\nchairman of the ways and means\ncommittee of the bouse of that !\nday just as the Fordtiev bill of |\ntoday bears the name of the\nchairman of the same committee. |\nWilliam L. Wilson of Wot\nVirginia. Democrat, was the author\nof the Wilson bill, which was\ni ? ....

It was in no sense a\nprotective measure and did not\ntake money from one citizen\'s\npocket to put it into another\'s.\nFollowing weeks of debate, the j\nhouse passed the hill and sent it\nto the senate, there to he emasculated\nby certain Democratic\nsenators, led by Arthur Pugh\nGorman of Maryland, who had\nfallen out with President Clevc- i\nlaud and thought to get even\nwith him in that way.\nWhen the Wilson hill was tinder\nconsideration the house of\nrepresentatives was Democratic j\nami the majority mcmhei> stood\nas one for,lower tariff rates to j\nrelieve the country of the hard j\ntimes upon which it had fallen.\nCompared with the panic through\nwhich the country was then passing,\nthe business depression of\ntlu* present day Walks big us pros- !\nperity?a statement which will J\nbe indorsed by all the middleaged\nand oUler eiti/ens who Wave\nmemory enough to recall what a\nterrible fix the Harrison admin- I\nfc* istrution left the nation in when\nit gave tip control of the govern- j\ninent in March. 1893. Many\nplaced the blame for the panic of\nthat year at the door of President J\nCleveland because it came an\nshortly after his second inauguration;\nhut these people conveniently\nignored the fact that the i\nplates from which the millions of |\ndollars worth of government\nbonds President Cleveland was\nforced to issue had been made hv\nthe Harrison administration in\nanticipation of the necessity of\nthus raising revenue to meet the\nexpenses of the government.\nThere were many men of out - j\nstanding ability in the house of\nrenresentatives in 189d. many I\nmore than there are in the house\nI oil ay. One of these was a young !\nman from the Middle West who I\n"Wuk serving his seeond term.

It was the good fortune of the\nwriter one Saturday night while\nthe Wilson hill was under consideration\nin the house of representatives\nto receive an invitation\nfrom a South Carolina congress- j\nman to occupy a seat in the members\'\ngallery for that night.\nShortly after the session opened\nthe young representative from\nthe Middle West rose from his\nseat to speak for the hill. He was\ngreeted by practically the entire\nmembership of the house, it was\nstated at the time, and people\nwere packed in the galleries like\ngrains of eory on a well matured\n\' ear. He had not spoken five\nminutes before everybody realized\nthat they were listening to\na master debater who was thornilfflllv\nfittiiiliiir with lii?\nThe Republicans, knowing in advance\nthat he was tt? apeak, had\n) on hand their strongest men\nready with many perplexing\nquestions they put to hiui in im\neffort to break the thread of bis\nargument or foree from him u\nstatement favorable to their view\nof the tariff.

Workmen in examining\nthe heavy wooden timbers\nthat supported the weave room\nfound that the timbers were af\n:.i\nttiru wuii ury rot aiul that\nuiaiiv of the in were in suck condition\nwhere they entered the\nwalls of the building that new\nsupports for the floor would have\nto be provided at once. In consequence\nof the discovery a row\nof brick columns was immediately\nerected in the cellar of the\nbuilding and ouv these columns\nsupporting timbers were placed,\nthereby removing all danger of\nthe floor collapsing. ]\nAn interesting story is told in\nconnection with these sleepers of\nthe old weave room, which was\nerected in 1887. At that time the\nSouthern railway was tearing\ndown the. wooden bridge which\nspanned the Catawba river three\nmiles south of Fort Mill preparatory\nto erecting the steel structure\nwhich stood there until it !\nwus washed away by the freshet\nof l^lti.

This\ntimber was bought hy the Fort ,\nMill Manufacturing company ami\na considerable part of it. including\nthe sleepers for the weave\nroom, was used iu the construe\ntion ot the mill.

JULY 28. 1921.\nUnited States Senator Tom\nWatson of Georgia is perhaps one\nof the best informed men in publie\nlife today, but he made a slip\nthat one would not have expected\nof him in explaining in his paper,\nthe t\'olumbiu Sentinel, of July 11\nwhy he refused to vote for the\nconfirmation of Mr. Tuft as chief\njustice of the supreme court.\nFor one thing. Senator \\yatson\ndid not like the elevation of Associate\nJustice White over Associate\n.Justice Harlan to the chief\njusticeship of the supreme court,\nfor which Mr. Taft. as president,\nwas responsible. "llarlan of\nKentucky," says Senator Watson.\n"was an ex-Confederate soldier,\nus Edward White had been,\nanil he was a Democrat, as White\nhad been." It is a fact that Associate\n.Justice Harlan was neither\nan ex-Confederate soldier nor a\nDemocrat. He was an ex-Union\nsoldier and a Republican. In the\nfirst campaign the late Senator\nMcCreary of Kentucky made for\nthe governorship of his State\nllarlan was his Republican opponent.\nMcCreary was elected, but\nHarlan made a campaign which\nwon for him a seat on the supreme\ncourt bench, to which he was appointed\nhv President Hayes.\nYears ajro .Justice llarlan was a\nmember of the law faculty of Columbian\nuniversity, Washington\nami more than once in his lectures\nhe was heard to refer to his\nservice in the Union army, but\n- never with any trace of bitterness\ntoward his countrymen who\nserved in the Confederate army.\nFour members of tin* board ot\'\naldermen ??f an American city recently\nstopped their home paper\nbecause the editor criticised the\nway in which street paving for\nwhich they were responsible was\nbeing done. The criticism bore\nevidence of disinterestedness and\napparently was written solely\nwith the view of serving the public.\nLoss of the four subscriptions\ndid not cause the paper to\nsuspend publication, however, as\nthe aldermen perhaps thought\nWould be the case. Most newspapers\nwhose editors express their\nviews of public matters, especially\npublic matters affecting their\nimmediate communities, make enemies,\nbut in the long run if their\ncriticisms arc fair and devoid of\nthe mean spirit too frequently\ndisplayed in editorial utterances,\nthe people recognize the good intentions\nof the editor and for\nevery subscription or advertisement\nbis paper loses three or four\nare gained.
