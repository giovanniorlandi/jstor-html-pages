Moore, who has been\neditor of the Columbia Record\nfor about two years, is to leave\nColumbia this week to take\ncharge of the editorial page of\nthe Knoxville Sentinel. His resignation\nfrom the editorship of\nThe Record took effect Sunday.\nBrooks Guin, a farmer, was\nkilled Saturday night at 6:30\no\'clock by G. A. Long, his\nbrother-in-iaw, when they met\non the Belfast road, eight miles\nfrom Newberry. The trouble\nbetween the two is of long\nstanding.\nGovernor Manning the last\nweek sent a message to the senate\nasking for the general assembly.\nto appoint a committee\nto examine into the facfthat\nthere were no records in the governor\'s\noffice of the previous administration.\n*\nThe United States supreme\ncourt has \'granted permission to\nT. U. Vaughn, former superintendent\nof an orphan\'s home at\nx Greenville, to prosecute at public\nexpense his appeal in the supreme\ncourt from the death sentence\nimposed upon him in the\nSouth Carolina courts for a grave\noffense.\nHalcott P. Green of Columbia\nwas Friday named by Gov.\nRichard I. Manning as a special\njudge for the term of the court\nof common pleas in York county,\nbeginning the first Monday in\nFebruary. The appointment\nwas made upon the recomrr.enda-1\ntion of the supreme court.\nThe entire plant of the Equinox\nCotton mill, at Anderson, employ\nin# between 450 and 500\npeople, has been at a standstill\nsince Thursday morning as a result\nof the weaving force, con- r\nsisting of about 100 persons,\nquitting their looms when an\norder reducing their pay went\ninto effect.\nGovernor Manning has grant\ned a reprieve to Tommy Grice\nfrom February 1 to March 1.\nGrice was convicted in Florence\ncounty in October. 1914, on the\ncharge of criminal assault and\nsentenced to be electrocuted on\nNovember 20. 1914. Gov. Blease\ngranted a reprieve until February\n1.\nHugh Byrd was killed on his\nfarm in the Gilgal section of\nEdgefield county by a falling\ntree Thursday. Having some\nwoodland that he desired to\ncultivate, he invited his neighbors\nto assist him in felling the\ntrees. He had just cut one tree\nand while watching it fall another\ntree that was cut near him fell\nacross his body.\nThe Anderson Mercantile company\nand the Farmers\' Supply\ncompany stores at Rjphburg, \\\nChester county, were robbed j\nFriday night. An entrance was\neffected" from the rear. A quantity\nof shoes, clothing and can\ngoods was stolen. There is no\nclue to the theft. It is believed |\nto be the same party that entered\nthe store of W. S. Douglas\natBtacbtock a few nights ago.\nCatawbas Visit the Governor.\nChief Harris, Ben Harris and\nNelson Blue, three Catawba\nbrnvp?. were among the visitors\nto Governor Richard I. Manning\na few days ago. They were introduced\nto the "great white\nchief" by Senator Beamguard j\nof York countv. "Wp nrp crlarl\nto meet you," said Chief Harris.\n"We hdVe brought you a present.\nHere is a \'pipe of peace/ "\nsaid Ben Harris. The pipe was\nmade by the Indians on the\nCatawba reservation. "Gov.\nRichard I Manning, January 19,\n1915," were the words carved on\nthe peace pipe. Governor Man- j\nning thanked the visitors and I\ngave them a hearty welcome. 1\n"Here is another pipe. Smoke,\nthis when you are alone." said j\nthe younger Indian. Governor\nManning assured the Indians\nthat they will receive kind and\nfair treatment during his administration.\n"We are just like\nchildren, governor, and we look\nto you for everything," saidj\nBen. The Indians were later\nintroduced to many members of\nthe legislature.\nNolan Refused to Leave Jail.\nAlthough four men escaped\nfrom the York county jail Thursday\nafternoon, the fiifth white\nman in the prison refused to take\npart in the affair and remained\nin his cell, while his companions\nmade a successful dash for liberty.\nThe fifth man was Thomas Nolan,\nalias "Chicago Nolan," famous\nin many States as a yeggman\nand an alleged expert at\nblowing safes and slipping\nthrough jail bars. Noland was 1\nrecently paroled by Governor j\ntsiease while serving a term in \\\nthe South Carolina penitentiary\nand was at once turned over to j\nfederal authorities to answer to\nother charges. He is being held\nin York jail to answer to the\ncharge of robbing the Savings i\nBank of Fort Mill in 1902. Nolan\nsaid he didn\'t want to go j\nand calmly watched the four\nother prisoners break jail and\nmake a getaway. When the jail\ndelivery was discovered and a\nhurried investigation made, No- j\nlan was found in his cell writing!\na letter.\nThe four men escaping were:\nJesse Willman, S. I. Rush, J. R.\nWyatt, and Sam Harper. They\nwere held on minor charges.\nWant to Change Name.\nYorkville, county seat of York\ncounty, will change the name it\nhas borne since 1790 to York, if\nthe qualified electors shall so decide\nat an election contemplated\nby a bill which the York county\'\n_i _ 1 a? ? i * "?\ndelegation nas introduced in the!\ngeneral assembly.\nThere was filed with the dele- :\ngation a petition bearing 190\nsignatures. The registration is\n217, so that a majority is 109.\nThe petition asked that the. delegation\nprocure the passage of an\nact effecting the change in\nname, but the members of the\ndelegation took the view that it\nwould be more equitable and\nmore in accordance with Democratic\npractice to refer the question\nto the people of Yorkville\nfor decision.\nSpare the Birds.\nIt was stated recently in a national\nconvention that protection\nof birds from slaughter would\nsave to the farmers of the United\nStates a large part of their\nannual crop loss from insect\npests. The same speaker estimated\nthe annual loss from insect\nat something more than\n$100,000,000. This game seems\nwell worth the candle.\nUNt GALLON PER SOSTH\nIS ALLOWANCE OF BILL\nThe Boyd whiskey shipment\nbill, which has already passed\nthe house and is likely to pass\nthe senate, is one of the strictest\nmeasures of the kind on the statute\nbook? of any of the States.\nThe bill was introduced in the\nHouse by Representative Boyd,\nof Spartanburg:. The measure\nwas fathered by the prohibitionists\nof the State, and principal,\nly by the Anti-Saloon League.\nIt was drafted in Spartanburg\noy senator uarnsie, at the request\nof local prohibitionists.\nUnder this bill no person will\nbe allowed to have shipped to\nhim in South Carolina more than\none gallon per month of any beverage\ncontaining as much as 1\nper cent, of alcohol. And in order\nto get this one gallon, he\nwill have to go before the clerk\nof court of his county and pay a\nfee of 25 cents for a permit allowing\nhim to have this amount\nshipped in. Upon getting the\npermit, he will have to send it\nto the liquor house, and the paper\nwill have to be pasted on the\noutside of the package or the\ntransportation company will not\nbe allowed to deliver it.\nThe clerk of court will be required\nto keep a record of the\ncertificates issued, and f-n see fr?\nto it that no person is allowed to\nget more than one gallon a\nmonth. The permit will be refused\nshould a protest be made\nby the wife or children of the\nperson asking for the permit.\nUnder the bill, the whiskjy\nshipment cannot be delivered to\nany person other than the purchaser,\nwho must appear in person.\nThe bill also prohibits the\nstoring of the whiskey in any\nclubhouse or place of business or\nanywhere else except in the\nprivate home or private room of\nthe purchaser.\nThe measure was passed by the\nhouse last week, and now goes\nto the senate. The only amendment\nwhich was made by the\nhouse is on permitting dispensaries\nto ship whiskey to\nbranch dispensaries in the same\ncounty. This, of course, does\n. not affect the measure so far as\nthe individual consumer is concerned,\nand would apply only in\ndispensary counties. Should the\nprohibition referendum bill pass,\nthis provision, of course, would\nautomatically cease to be of\nvalue because the dispensaries\nwould pro out of business.\nThe bill restricts interstate\nliquor shipments under authority\nof the Webb law passed by congress\na year or so ago.\nThe Home Paper What Counts.\n"It is the home paper, in the\nsmaller cities, which sells our\ngoods," said Geo. W. Dodd, representative\nof a big Eastern manufacturing\nbouse, before a recent\nmeeting of advertising men in\nAtlanta.\n"We sell to the merchants in\nthese towns, and th? live ones\nadvertise in their home papers.\nI can check over the sales reports\nright now and show you\nwhich merchants are advertising\nand which are not, just by the\norders they send us. I\'ve tried it.\n"It\'s a big mistake for the\n\'liitle merchant\' to think he cannot\ngdvertise. Why, the merchant\nin a comparatively small\ntown can reach mnr#* n/\\aoiki*?\ncustomers per dollar spent on\nnewspaper space than the big\nfellow in New.York or Chicago\ncan at the heavy rates made nec\'essary\nby the big papers\' circulation.\nHis home paper reaches\nnearly every every possible buyer\nin its territory. Can the big\npapers say as much?"\nSOME FACTS fBOUT\nTHE WEATHER LAST YEAR\nThe year 1914 as a whole was\nnear normal as to temperature,\nalthough the precipitation was\nslightly below the average, due\nlargely to marked deficiencies in\nMarch, May and June. Abnor\nmal thermal and moisture conditions\nduring March, followed by\nj badly distributed rains during\nApril, resulted in irregular seeding\nof spring crops, and vegeta!\ntion began the growing season\nin various stages of advancment.\n| The growing situation was further\nintensified by drought and\nmuch sunshine during May, with\nthe result that the spring season\nclosed 8.i)0 inches short of the\nusual amount of rainfall. With\n, continued lack of sufficient and\ni well distributed rains and the\nhottest weather on record for\nJ June, together with desicating\nheat toward the close of July,\nvegetation advanced to midseason\nwith irregular growth.\nProbably the most serious and\ndestructive thundershowers and\nhailstorms that ever visited the\nplantations of South Carolina ocin\nthe Piedmont section on Julv\n6 and 7. covering large portions\nof Anderson. Laurens, Spartanburg.\nCherokee and York counties\nand entailing a general loss\nconservatively estimated at nearly\na million dollars on 51,000\nacres of land. Of this amount\nYork county is estimated to have\nlost about $730,000 on about <10,000\nacres. In this district, the\nhail belt embraced an area of\nfive by 25 miles northward of\nRock Hill.\nVetoed Immigration Bill.\nPresident Wilson voted the\nimmigration bill Thursday because\nof the literacy test for\nadmission of aliens. His message\nwas referred to the house\nimmigration committee whose\nchairman, Representative Bur\nnett, will move next that the\nmeasure be passed over the veto.\nMuch informal discussion\namong members of the house\nfollowed receipt of the veto, and\nthere were many who believed\nthe two-thirds majority required\nto repass the bill could\nnot be procured. Immigration\nbills containing literacy tests\nwere vetoed by President Cleveland\nand by Presfdent Taft, but\nboth times failed of repassage.\nSank Five Vessels.\nThp tr>ll tnkpn tw tVm ritirnmn\nsubmarine U-21 in its raid late\nSaturday in the Irish Sea in the\n| vicinity of Liverpool, still stands\n\'at three ships?the steamers\n1 Ben Cruachen, Linda Blanche\nand the Kilcoan, the last a small\nvessel. The Kilcoan\'s crew was\nlanded Sunday on the Isle of\nMan by a coastwise steamer.\nIn addition a German submarine\nalso torpedoed two British\nj steamers in the English Channel\nnear Havre? the Tokomaru and\nthe Icarian.\nThe Irish Sea raider escaped\nand shipping interests, confident\nshe had returned to her base,\n! i i* *\ni oruereu a resumption or normal\ntraffic Sunday.\nGets Important Appointments.\nYorkville people are interested\nin learning that W. R. Bradford,\none of the representatives from\nthis county, is beinc olaced on\na number of very important\ncommittees. Mr. Bradford has\nbeen named as a member of the\ncommittee to investigate the\ndisappearance of certain records\nfrom the office of the governor\nand to arrange for suitable filing\ndevices to be placed in the office.\nHe is also a member of several\n, other important committees.\nI York News.\nRevenue Collections Fall Short.\nRevenue collections by the\nGovernment in January failed\nby $8. 166,427 to meet the month\'s\ndisbursement. Receipts usually\nare low at this time of the yoar.\nbut in January 1914, the excess\nof disbursements, was only $4,512,262.\nNeither customs nor internal\nrevenue brought in the expected\nreturns. Customs receipts were\n$10,558. 1 93, compared with $23.528,080\nin January, 1914, and\n$14,890,982 in December.\nInternal revenue receipts including\nreturns from the war\ntax were $27,096,155, less by\ni $5,0(10,000 than in December,\nand only about $2,500,000 more\nthan in January, 1914. The\nestimate of Government revenues\nfor the fiscal year ending June\n30 next contemplated internal\nrevenue receipts of $32,500 a\nmonth. Officials are hopeful of\n\' an increase in the next few\nmonths.\nNext Meet at Yorkville.\nThe committee on arrangeI\nment has decided to hold the\nnext school day program at\nYorkville on Saturday. April 3.\nThe exercises will consist of\nmental and athletic contests.\nThe pupils will he entered according\nto grade in the mental\ncontests and only one from each\njschool can enter the contest. In\nthe athletic contests the students\nwill he grouped according to\nsize. This will give the small\nschool an equal chance with the\nlarge schools. - Rock Mill Herald.\nI New Spri\nI Prices on cotton\nthanthev have\nyears.

It was believed\nthat the prohibition bills\nwould precipitate long debates,\nbut the Webb law bill went\nthrough the house practically\nwithout opposition and not more\nthan five hours were spent in\ndiscussing the prohibition referendum\nbill.\nHaving disposed of the prohibition\nquestion, the house has before\nit this week the vital matter\nof compulsory education. There\nis not the slightest doubt about\nthe passage of some form of compulsory\neducation law by the\nhouse. The only point in contest\nis whether the members will\nagree to send to the senate a\nStatewide measure or one containing\nthe local option feature.\nThe Hawkins bill, a Statewide\nmeasure, and the Harper bill,\nhave both been made special orders\nfor debate on Wednesday.\nThe house will have to choose\nbetween them.

Of course, it is poor\neconomy to keep horses and\nmules to a number beyond those\nneeded, for idleness for them\nmeans a heavy expense without\nany return!
