        <pre>['For The Record: The Higher Dignity \nMAXINE GREENE \n \nThe artist\'s sense of truth. Regarding truths, \nthe artist has a weaker morality than the \nthinker. He definitely does not want to be \ndeprived of the splendid and profound \ninterpretations of life, and he resists sober, \nsimple methods and results. Apparently he \nfights for the higher dignity and significance \nof man; in truth, he does not want to give up \nthe most effective presuppositions of his art: \nthe fantastic, mythical, uncertain, extreme, \nthe sense for the symbolic, the \noverestimation of the person, the faith in \nsome miraculous element in the genius. \nThus he considers the continued existence \nof his kind of creation more important than \nscientific devotion to the truth in every form, \nhowever plain. \n \nFriedrich Nietzsche, Human, All-Too-Human \n \nAt the close of the last century, when \nNietzsche wrote those words, many people \nfelt appalled by the descriptions of \nhumankind being presented by biologists \nand psychologists; and there was \nconsiderable talk about the possibility of \ncreating a new "image of man." It was \nrecognized, however, that the observations \nof the Darwinians and the empirical \npsychologists could not easily be discredited. \nScientists could hardly be expected to \nrestore the human person to his traditional \nplace "below the angels." They could not be \nexpected to retract what they had said about \nman\'s animal ancestry, his brutishness and \nunlovely instincts, and make him "paragon" \nagain, with all the dignity and significance he \nhad once possessed. Understandably, many \nof them turned to the artist for the vision of \ndignity they so deeply desired; and \noccasionally (although not very often, when \nthe new century began) the artist met the \nwishful demand for a meaningful "image," a \nsustaining one. Nietzsche knew what few \nwould dare admit: that the rendering of man \nas significant in the cosmos was nothing but \nillusion, a necessary illusion. He knew that \n"sober, simple methods" could only result in \nneutral description, not in judgments about \nhuman dignity, nor in assurances with \nrespect to human worth. \n \nIn our own time, there is a pervasive \nconcern about the significance of man. On \nall sides, we hear talk of the experience of \npowerlessness, of "meaninglessness." \nFrequently it is evoked by the Vietnamese \nwar: intellectuals, like dissident young \npeople, feel frustrated by their apparent \nhelplessness in the face of a commitment \nthat horrifies them, bombings that sicken \nthem, claims that they do not believe. Or \nelse, particularly in the slums, it is evoked by \nunrelenting poverty and unemployment, \nwhich (so it appears) no one has the power \nto assuage. In more general terms, feelings \nof impotence are expressed in relation to the \n"system": the bureaucracies, the corporate \ninstitutions, the hierarchies of technicians \nseem to cancel out the person in his \nuniqueness and fallibility. On occasion, the \nexpansion of technologies afflicts people: \nthey make the computer a fearful symbol; \nthey see themselves as mere ciphers in a \n"Brave New World." And the response, just \nas in Nietzsche\'s time, is increasingly one of \naestheticism. People begin to reject both the \nempirical and the moral in their yearning for \nrenewed significance. They set up "images" \nagainst what they perceive as the void. \n \nIt may seem paradoxical, given the current \n"cognitive" stress in educational discussion, \nbut the "weaker morality" has made \nconsiderable inroads within education in \nrecent months. By this we mean—not that \neducators are becoming less moral—but \nthat there is a growing attraction to what \nLionel Trilling (in Beyond Culture) calls the \n"criterion of style, the examination of life by \naesthetic categories----" Trilling writes that \nthis criterion and these categories are \nreplacing traditional moral and ethical \ncriteria and categories—that, in fact, young \npeople today support their impulses to \ndefine the kinds of persons they will be with \na "moralizing attitude" about taste and style. \nHe says, moreover, that there now exist two \n"cultural environments": one, the traditional, \noften moralistic environment; the other, \ndefined by "its commitment to the \'sources \nof life,\' by its adherence to the imagination of \n', 'fullness, freedom, and potency of life, and to \nwhat goes with this imagination. . . ." \n \nHow does this affect education? Some \nteachers (and educational theorists) find \nconsiderable value in the existence of this \n"adversary culture" and choose to \nencourage it, even though this may mean \ntaking issue (at least implicitly) with the \n"system" into which they are expected to \ninitiate the young. And this is \nunderstandable. Everything they hear about \nthe "now generation," the "plugged-in \ngeneration," and the "total environment" in \nwhich they presumably live, moves certain \nkinds of teachers to motivate by affirmation \nand sympathy. Motivate to what? Frequently \nto increased imaginative awareness, to the \n"expansion of consciousness" made \npossible by creative work. This may be why \nwe presently hear so much about the poetry \nof the supposedly "unteachable," why we \nare being convinced that the free expression \nof what has been suffered and seen is itself \na kind of forming, a preparation for the more \ncomplex orders identified with the disciplines. \n \nWe are beginning to see more and more \nrespect for the "adversary culture" among \nthose who write about education and the \nschools. Exemplary in these days is a paper \nrecently reprinted in The Research Reporter, \nthe newsletter of the Center for Research \nand Development in Higher Education at \nBerkeley. The author is Warren Bryan Martin, \nwhose "An Answer for Anomie" we \npublished in October, 1966. Constructing \nwhat strikes us as a fairly questionable \ndichotomy of "essentialist" and \n"existentialism" as the two positions \nconfronting each other in education, Dr. \nMartin goes on to associate "existentialism" \n(or the concern for the unique individual) \nwith a challenge to the "system." For him, \n"system" now refers—not to the great \nrational structures Kierkegaard, for one, had \nin mind—but to "technique unerringly \nachieving programmed results. . . ." \nAlthough we are not sure precisely why, this \n"means" to Dr. Martin that, in education, the \nindividual is no longer being educated for \nhimself but "in and for the system." Using \nthis notion as a premise, he says that the \nyounger generation has been "turned-on," \nnot by mass media but "by a panexistential \nethos that challenges youth to look within \nthemselves, to feel things deeply, and to \ninsist on meanings in life that are personal \nand vital." \n \nIn this manner, he too arrives at the \n"adversary culture"; but, for him, it appears \nto be a necessary response to the \nincursions of technique upon the lives of \nmen. And those incursions are, it would \nseem, as objectively real as the "panexistential\nethos" he perceives as he looks \naround. The ethos is described in language \nmany would associate with aesthetic rather \nthan with philosophic talk: the students who \nare existentialist are said to be tolerant of \nambiguities, sceptical of "form," eager for a \n"new freedom," hungry for "vitality" and \n"affective" learning, engaged in a continual \nquest for meanings, "naked and alone." Dr. \nMartin does not become an all-out partisan \nof this position when he reaches his \nconclusion. His emphasis turns out to be \n"inclusiveness"; he wishes "both sides" to be \nconsidered when innovations are proposed. \nIt is when he says "both sides" that he \nseems to us to be exemplifying a peculiar \nmisconception respecting art, truth, and \nmorality—a misconception we find \npenetrating a great deal of discourse in our \nfield. \n \nNietzsche was not guilty of this \nmisconception, although he is sometimes \ngiven credit for the viewpoints to which it \ngives rise. The source of it seems to us to \nbe in a confusion of aesthetic judgments \nwith, let us say, moral judgments, and with \nempirical statements as well. To talk of \nmanner, medium, style, and tone is, as \nTrilling has made clear, to talk aesthetically. \nThe judgments arising in the course of such \ntalk, he points out, "are the stuff of the great \nclassic literature of the modern world." They \nhave had a "liberating" power in time past, \nbecause they helped shake conventional \nacceptances and outmoded moralisms. \nToday, when the young person rebels \nagainst "squares," philistines, or the \n"establishment," he is no longer alone. He \ndoes not need the liberating judgments to \ngive him courage. There exists, after all, an \nentire world—a "second environment," says \nTrilling—in which such rebels can dwell. It is \na world with its own rules and pieties, its \nown acceptable ("moralized") tastes and \nstandards. Everyone who goes to see \n', 'contemporary films, or drops in to see "pop" \npictures, "primary structures," and "magic \nrealism" at the art galleries, or who reads \nThe New York Review of Books, Evergreen \nReview, Partisan Review, yes, even Esquire, \nor who knows the names of Pinter and \nAlbee, or who reads Pynchon, Vonnegut, \nBarth, Friedman, and the others, knows very \nwell that there now exists an intellectual and \nartistic culture with its own complex \nrequirements and norms. \n \nWe suspect that many teachers, when they \nventure into the outskirts of that world, often \nfeel somehow inadequate. Not to be "with it" \nbecomes a kind of disgrace; yet they are \nconstantly reminded that few people "over \nthirty" can be inducted or be made to \nunderstand. Some educators wonder sadly \nwhether it is all a great "put-on" or spoof. \nThe "put-on," as Jacob Brackman has \nexplained in The New Yorker (June 24, \n1967), has become a mode of \ncommunication occupying "a fuzzy territory \nbetween simple leg-pulling and elaborate \npractical joke, between pointed lampoon and \nfree-floating spoof." Experiencing it, one has \nto fight to keep one\'s detachment and one\'s \n"cool"; one can never be absolutely sure \nwhether something is "true"—or a joke. \n \nThere are educators who feel this way about \nthe hippies and even about drugs. Clearly \nthere are those who feel this way with \nrespect to conversation and sloganizing that \nsound "existential" or, perhaps, \n"panexistential." It seems safer to take it all \nseriously, to give it an objective status, than \nto be fooled. \n \nThis may, in any case, be one reason why \nso much of the contemporary talk about art \nis being absorbed in educational discourse. \nThis may be one reason why such \npreoccupations as those expressed in talk of \n"non-linear," "subliminal," "surreal," as well \nas in talk of "style," are treated as judgments \nabout the nature of things in the modern \nworld rather than judgments about manner, \nmood, and tone. To talk of how one chooses \nto look and act, to talk of "sincerity" as the \nhighest value, to avoid "interpretation," to \noppose "medium" to "message," is quite \ndifferent from talking about decency, \nhumaneness, compassion, and goodness. \nTo put an exclusive emphasis upon these \nthings is, in addition, to verge on antiintellectualism—a\nstrange posture for an \neducator to take. \n \nThe point is not that it is "wrong" for young \npeople to feel afflicted by the great \nanonymous super-structures of the modern \nage, nor that feelings of helplessness and \nalienation are unwarranted. It seems to us \nentirely appropriate, in fact, that certain \nteachers try to sympathize with the feelings \nthat drive so many young people into \nwithdrawal and dissent. But this does not \nhave to mean a confusion of those \nfeelings—and the styles associated with \nthem—with a moral or intellectual position. \nSympathy, even empathy, do not require \neducators to teach the "adversary culture." \n(Would there be an adversary culture if it \nwere deliberately cultivated in the schools?) \n \nNietzsche was attracted by the "weaker \nmorality" of artists, because the ones he had \nin mind were at least able to sustain the \nillusion of human dignity and potency. Yeats, \nLawrence, Joyce, Pound, and the other \ngreat moderns mentioned by Lionel Trilling \ncould justify promulgation of that "weaker \nmorality" because of the contribution it made \nto "liberating" young people from a sterile, \nrestraining code of life, if not from trivialities. \nNeither of these justifications seem to work \ntoday. Contemporary art does not sustain \nthe ancient illusion of dignity. And, as we \nhave said, art is no longer needed as a \nliberating force, at least not in the 19th \ncentury sense. \n \nWe believe that educational discourse will \nbe obfuscated if attention is not paid to \nclarifying the role of art and distinguishing \nbetween the aesthetic and the moral. We \nalso believe that a disservice will be done to \nworks of art, if they are conceived simply as \nproducts of the same search for "vitality" and \n"spontaneity" on which so many college \nstudents are embarked. \n \nGiven what we now understand about \nknowing and the known, a work of art can \nonly be conceived as a particular artist\'s \nsymbolic rendering of his own subjectively \nexperienced world. "Art," we now realize, is \nnot amenable to true definition; but we can \ngeneralize to the point of saying that art is \nalmost always a mode of transmuting some \n', 'of the stuff of human experience into \nsymbolic and expressive form. The painting \nor the poem that results is something \ndeliberately created out of the raw materials \nof paint and canvas, of language. With one, \nwe encounter colors, shapes, and lines in \nrelationship with one another, or a free play \nof forms and colors for their own sake. With \nthe other, we encounter a patterning of \nsounds, a play of images, a structure of \nmeanings. Both painting and poem \ncommunicate by means of what have been \ncalled "cryptograms" (gradations of color, \narrangements of planes, for example, \nmetaphors and other figures), some sort of \nmessage to the senses, the feelings, the \nmind. It is a message that cannot be \nparaphrased, that does not exist apart from \nthe work. It need not be "true" in any \nempirical sense; it need not be translatable \nin any way at all. But it is a message, \nnonetheless, about the human condition. It \nis an expressive rendering of what it is to be \nalive at a particular moment of time. It would \nnot communicate, however; it would not \nexpress; it would not move, arouse, excite, \nilluminate, if it were not consciously and \ndeliberately made, modelled, formed. \n \nWhen modern readers encounter works like \nThomas Pynchon\'s V., with its passive antihero\nnamed Benny Profane and his "Whole \nSick Crew" of friends, they are not likely to \ndiscover images of pride and potency which \nrestore a sense of "the higher dignity and \nsignificance of man. . . ." When they read \nbooks like Joseph Heller\'s Catch-22 or \nWilliam Burroughs\' Naked Lunch, they are \nnot likely to feel liberated from the "system," \nwhose consequences for individual \nconsciousness both novels do so much to \ndramatize. So it is when modern people \nconfront the looming, anonymous sculptures \ncalled "primary structures," the high intensity \ncolors of "Op" paintings, the stark objectivity \nof the images connoted by "Pop." And when \nthey see films like Antonioni\'s Blow-Up or \nBergman\'s Persona or the Pinter-Losey \nAccident. \n \nThey will receive no "knowledge" from works \nof art like these; they will find no \nabstractions, no ideal forms revealed. They \nwill, rather, find themselves engaged with \nthe efforts of highly sensitive men to shape \nwhat Wallace Stevens once called a \n"supreme fiction," some mode of making \nsense in an inchoate world. Once engaged, \nthey may find themselves subjectively \ninvolved; they may begin confronting \nthemselves. Self-confrontation of this sort \nsignifies more than a return to one\'s "true \nself," one\'s spontaneity. It signifies the kind \nof engagement with art that becomes a \nmode of ordering one\'s own, one\'s personal \nexperience. The arts seem to us to have a \nunique capacity to move those who can \nrespond to them to create their own patterns \nand forms. They have the capacity to enable \npeople to gain perspective upon the \ndiscontinuous events, the simultaneous \noccurrences which today compose their \nexperience—to transmute mere "noise" into \nmessage, if not into knowledge and \ninformation. \n \nThe arts, in other words, cannot be \ndepended upon to redeem, to inspire, or to \nliberate. Certainly they cannot be depended \nupon to make young people more moral or \nhumane. But they can move individuals to \nbreak through conventional mental sets \n(even the sets of the "second environment"); \nthey can help them come to terms with the \nblinding surfaces and happenings of our \nelectronic age, to shape new orders in the \nmidst of flux—to see, in some sense, anew. \n \nTo subsume such possibilities under revolt \nagainst the "system" is to stifle them. To \nabstract certain characteristics from \nparticular works of modern art or criticism \nand apply them to the behavior of youthful \nrebels is to deform what the young people \nare trying to say. We have the capacity to \nenable our students to become people \nsomewhat like the hero of Walker Percy\'s \nThe Last Gentleman—Will, who felt like "a \nman who had crawled out of a bombed \nbuilding. Everything looked strange. He \ncould see things afresh." Or perhaps like the \nnarrator in Ralph Ellison\'s Invisible Man, \nwaiting in his underground room to merge: \n"In going underground, I whipped it all \nexcept the mind, the mind. And the mind \nthat has conceived a plan of living must \nnever lose sight of the chaos against which \nthat pattern was conceived." The crucial \nterms are "mind," "plan," and "pattern." \nThese suggest to us the values with which \neducators are fundamentally concerned. \n \n', 'The "higher dignity" today is not to be found \nin the formlessness and despair and \nimpotence being rendered by contemporary \nartists. It is to be found in the ordering, the \npatterning their renderings make possible for \nthe ones who have learned to understand. \nTo conceive "a plan of living" against a \nbackdrop of meaninglessness is not to give \nin to the "system" that cancels out the \nperson. It is to act throughout one\'s life to \ncreate a self, a self that is freely chosen and \nformed. This may be the only true \n"significance" to be achieved by human \nbeings. Surely it is something teachers \n(especially empathetic teachers) need to \nkeep in mind. \n \nMG\n \n']</pre>
