Petersburg, Oct. 15.—A dispatch\nfrom General Sakharoff, sent at 6\no\'clock Friday morning, explains more\nof the operations of Oct. 12 and 13,\nfrom which it appears that the Russian\ncenter was due north of the Yentai\nmines, the right running west a short\ndistance beyond the railroad and the\nleft sweeping southeastward toward\nBensihu. The real bloody work did\nnot begin until Wednesday, when the\nJapanese made a series of determined\nattacks on Bialiuhedzy, about seven\nmiles north of Yentai, but the Russians\nheld olf their assailants. In the mean\xad\ntime, however, the extreme right, was\nforced back,, thus compelling Kuropat\nkin to slightly draw back his line\nabove Yentai in order to preserve its\nalignment, on the extreme left, alter\na determined resistance, the Russians\nsucceeded in carrying the rocKy\nheights and Hua pass north of Ben\xad\nsihu, but the arrival of Japanese rein\xad\nforcements made it impossible for th\nRussians to press their advantage\n\'here and as the left was now too i.ar\nadvanced it also was withdrawn somt\ndistance.- Reports from the left, how\xad\never, only bring the situation up to\nThursday afternoon.\nTHE NORTH DAKOTA DAY\nKate Thyson Marr Finds Much To Entertain\nand Edify At the North Dakota Re\xad\nception At St. Louis.\nj.VaA.1,, if. ,1 ,**"• ,t-1 J.\nalr^\'f r*\nLIFT FUNK ORDERED BACK\nJAPS THREATENED TO CUT OFF\nA SECTION OF THE RUS\xad\nSIAN ARMY.\nSt Petersburg, Oct. 15.-r-General\nKuropatkin reports that he has or\xad\ndered the Russian troops on his left\nflank to retire because Japanese rein\xad\nforcements threatened to cut them off.\nThe dispatch says, regarding the\nfighting of Oct. 12 and Oct. 13, that\nthe Russians on the right Wing de\xad\nfended their advanced positions ana\nalso portions of the different main po\xad\nsitions, particularly in the direction of\nSialiupedzy, until towards evening,\nwher Kuropatkin ordered them to\nwithdraw a short distance. In spite of\nthe fact that the Japanese attacks\nwere chiefly directed against these\ntroops they held the ground to which\nthey retired.\nOn t!be left wing, after a very ob\xad\nstinate struggle, the Russians occupied\nthe Rocky lulls, south of Bentsiaputze\nand near Bensihu, about eight miles\nnorth of Yentai, but the arrival of\nlarge Japanese reinforcements pre\xad\nvented them from profiting by this\nsuccess\'and as this, body was separated\nfrom the rest of the troops Kuropatkin\nordered it to retire.\nThe dispatch reiterates that the Rus\xad\nsians suffered heavy ,losses, but no de\xad\ntails have yet been given out.\nIt is now evident that Kuropatkin\'s\nplan was to press his advance, not\ndirectly from the front, but toward the\nleft for the purpose of getting in the\nrear of Oyama\'s triangle.\nPartial Casualty List\nTokio, Oct. 15.—The first partial\ncasualty report of the battle now pro\xad\ngressing south of Mukden was re\xad\nceived during the day. Part of the\ncentral column of the le!t army lost\non Wednesday 1 officer killed and 6\nwounded and had about 300 men killed\nor wounded.\nNorth Dakotans were out in force,\nas well as many of the hostesses of\nthe various state buildings, and a bevy\nof pretty girls that always give life\nand color to social scenes.\nLieut.-Goy. Bartlett received hie\nfriends and made the introductions\npersonally, proving the ideal host. The\narrangements were perfect, and we.\nwhb have always contended that a\nman is a better housekeeper than a\nwoman, are more than ever convinced\nof the fact after the North Dakota\nreception.\nA string orchestra from the Filipino\nVisayan village played popular selec\xad\ntions from time to time, which were\nheartily enjoyed. The little Brownie\nmusicians are so often in evidence at\ntheBe state functions and daily gain\nin popularity.\nRefreshments were served and al\xad\ntogether the North Dakota reception\nwas a brilliant success, and we con\xad\ncluded that if the wife of the Lieuten\xad\nant-Governor Indulged a penchant for\npink teas she need lose no beauty\nsleep, but would find an able coadjutor\nin the managerial accomplishment of\nMr. Bartlett.\nThe reception lasted from 3 till 5,\nevery moment of which was enjoyable.\nThe arrangements wore perfect, the\nhost beaming with cordiality, and, al\xad\ntogether, North Dakotans may well be\nproud of her representatives at the\nWorld\'s Fair.\nAt 5 o\'clock Gov. Francis, with a\nhost of riends, appeared, and the gov\xad\nernor of North Dakota and the ex-gov\xad\nernor of Missouri exchanged the glad\nhand, wlhen the president of the\nWorld\'s Fair introduced his friends.\nAfter a tew formalities, Gov. Francis\ninvited the party to drive about the\ngrounds in the great tallyfco coach,\nwhich lately arrived from the Yellow\xad\nstone Park, and drawn by six splendid\ndapple grays. The ride was delight\xad\nful, the eoach winding in and about\nthe many buildings, until finally draw\xad\ning op opposite the entrance of\nthe\nTyrolean JJps, where friends awaited\nthe distinguished North Dakotans, who\ndined there later.\nSt Petersburg, Oct. 15.—Unofficial\nreports from the battle field are more\nencouraging this morning. The Rus\xad\nsians have fallen back twenty miles\nbut there has been no rout. Kuropat\xad\nkin has retired across Shakhe river\nand is holding the Japanese in check\nthere.\nREPORTED BY KUROPATKIN\nBELATED DISPATCHES TELL OF\nRUSSIAN DEFEAT ON THE\nRIGHT FLANK.\nSt Petersburg, Oct. 15.—The em\xad\nperor has received the following dis\xad\npatch from General Kuropatkin:\n"Two regiments of the Russian right\non Oct 12 sustained heavy losses. The\ncommander of one was killed and the\nbrigade commander was wounded.\nBoth regiments were compelled to\nwithdraw, abandoning their artillery,\nbut subsequently, under Colonel Van\nnovsky, who temporarily assumed com\xad\nmand of the brigade, they, after a des\xad\nperate assault, regained possession of\nthe guns with the exception of sixteen,\nwhich remained in the hands of the\nJapanese. The final issue of the battle\nWednesday on this flank was unsuc\xad\ncessful for us. On account of a night\nattack of the Japanese, who executed\nturning movements, our troops were\nforced not only to abandon their posi\xad\ntions, but again lost the guns previ\xad\nously recovered from the Japanese.\nOur forces retired to the position pre\xad\nviously prepared on the Shakhe\nriver."\nVALUABLE GOOD8 SEIZED.\nSaid to Have Been Smuggled in on a\nTransport\nNorfolk, Va., Oct 15.—A seizure by\ncustoms officers of Turkish and Per\xad\nsian goods, valued at thousands of\ndollars, which were brought from Eu\xad\nrope by the naval collier Hannibal,\nhas created excitement in naval cir\xad\ncles. The affair is now in the hands\nof the secretary of the navy for in\xad\nvestigation.\nThe information leading up to the\nseizure came in the form of an anony\xad\nmous letter to the authorities before\nthe Hannibal reached this port some\ndays ago from Gibraltar. Captain\nBaston, commanding the collier, de\xad\nclined to make any statement more\nthan to say:\n"No smuggled goods were brought\ninto port it was not intended to smug\xad\ngle any goods here."\nBOOKMAKERS HIT HARD.\nLeet .Quarter of a Million Dollars en\na Horse Race.\nNew York, Oct 15.—The bookmakers\nat Morris Park and the port rooms of\nthe city were hit for *250,000 during\nthe afternoon, when Lady Henrietta\ngalloped home ahead of a field of twen\xad\nty-two hones in the third race on the\ncerd. was the hardest blow of the\nReason and one of the biggest killings\never made on the track.\nA\'\nWtVfr Swin!\n»^iW»Sf 1*\n.4?\n1\n^J*v\n-U\njS •.£\nSt. Petersburg Looks Upon the Re\xad\ntreat As Encouraging, As the\nJaps May Not Be Able To\nCatch \'Em.\nTokio Advices Say Gen.

The\nenemy showed a sign of retreat to\xad\nwards the evening and our forces as\xad\nsumed the offensive since daybreak of\nThursday. The flanking movement of\nour strong force of cavalry on the\nKanlen largely contributed to the\nfavorable development of the situation\nin that quarter.\n"The central and left columns of the\nright army both occupied important\neminences, continuing attacks.

The author of the alleged dia\xad\nlogue between Boucher and Little, is\na man who has been the beneficiary of\nmany kindnesses from Mr. Little and\nfrom the "power® that be" generally.\nThe house that Ed Allen has lived in\nduring many years has sufficient of\nglass in its construction to be vulner\xad\nable to attacks.

Little is a gentleman in every\nsense of the word—has his frailties,\nfaults and his peculiarities like other\nmen of affairs. Col. Little\'s bank is a\nsort of clearing bouse for the state\ntreasurer. It is not true that there\nis kept on deposit large sums of money\nthat the bank can safely consider per\xad\nmanent enough to loan out.

As a mere accommo\xad\ndation to the people of this city in the\nabsence of private brick yards the\npenitentiary management, through\nrules laid down by the board of trus\xad\ntees, has sold brick to private parties\n—not in email quantities, however, as\nit\' was not thought wise to do so.\nThere has been no discrimination or\nplaying of favorites In the sale of\nbrick. The state has sold the brick\nat a slight profit and that profit has\ngone into the state treasury. Col.\nLittle has paid for brick the same as\nany other citizen—no less, no more,\nand the records at the capltol show\nthis. It is not fair even in a political\ncampaign to Intentionally misrepresent\nthe facts in this matter as Mr. Allen\nhas done. Mr. Little\' pays $8 per\nthousand for the brick now being used\nin the new department store building\nand others would be requested to pay\nno more. The state does not sell\nbrick in small quantities however and\nif some one will start a brick yard the\nstate will not sell another brick.\nThe Tribune has gone into this mat\xad\nter somewhat extensively because the\nattacks on Col Little seem so unwar\xad\nranted and especially from the source\nthey now emanate.\nMr. Allen has had the benefit of rail\xad\nroad passes, telegraph franks and\nother courtesies and Is not to be criti\xad\ncised therefor.
