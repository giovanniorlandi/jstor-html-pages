The man with the\nbundle looked at the drummers,\nlaughed and said: "If these\nwere farmers, I would not tell\n, what I have in this package." 1\nasked him why. lie said because\nhe would be afraid the farmers\nwould pitch him out of the car\nwindow when they learned what\nthe package meant.\nNot being afraid of the drummers.\nlie said he had "samples\nof pickings." 1 knew what he\nmeant, but the drummers did\nnot, so he told them.\nThe man said he was in the\nempiuy oi ? uuuun oipmuug\nfirm, that they bought cotton\ndirect from farmers; that the\nfarmer would rrnt protect his\ncotton from the earth and wea\'her\nafter ginning; that cotton\nbales were always damaged irom\nlying on the ground, and that;\nwhen offered for sale?a tiling\nour farmers do not know?the\nf buyer makes a guess at the\ndamage, always guessing so as\nto protect himself from loss. For\ninstance, it the buyer oeiieves\nthere is five pounds damage on a\nbale he deducts 10 pounds or\nmore ; or if the damage perhaps\nis 20 pounds, he deducts 40 or\n50 pounds.\nNow this damaged cotton doe.v ,\nnot cost the buyer anything, but ,\nis a direct loss to the farmer, lii 1\nfirm has several compresses. Th?cotton\nis re-picked and re-La] ;d\nat the compress, the good curb n\nexported and the "pickings"\nsold in America for ropes, hatting,\ncoverings for wire, ando\'h\ner low class cot\'on products.\n"Our stiles," saul tbe man\nwith the bundle, "lor this season,\nfor cotton we picked from damaged\nbales, will amount to if20,\n000. No cost to cur firm except\nto sort the damaged from the\ngood cotton at the compress."\nHe was asked if this damaged!\ncotton came in competi\'ion with\ngood cotton. "Certainly it does\'",\nhe said. If the farmer would\nprevent the damage, the mills\nwhich use this cotton would be\nforced to buy the bettor cotton I\nand then plow lines would last\nlonger."\nMrs. Farmer, where is your\nold man\'s cotton that he is holding\nto sell at 15 cents per pound?\nHas it been placed in a warehouse,\nwhich is the proper place\nfor it? Or is it on the ground\ngrowing a grade ot cotton to go\ninto rotten plow lines?\nTwenty thousands dollars due>\nn >t represent the original value\nol the above cotton, it only represents\nthe selling valuo after\ndamage. This transaction perhaps\nrepresented a loss to the\ncotton growers of from $50,000\nto $100,000.\nWhajn will the Southern farmer\nlearn to slop such lo?seb?\nC. O.
