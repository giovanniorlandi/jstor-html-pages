II. RENEIIAN, S. r\'y.\nMONDAY EVENING,, MARCH 5, 1900.\nNO SNOWSTORMS IN NEW MEXICO\nR. M. Hardinge, of the New Mexico\n.weatihor bureau at Santa Fe, has sup\nplied all newspaper offices today with\ncopies of \'his printed snowfall bulletin.\nThe data received at meteorological\nheadquarters In Santa Fe substantiates\nthe claim that the total snowfall this\n.winter \'has been much less than the\naverage amount. There has practi\ncally been no snow below altitudes of\n8,000 feet, and on southern slopes\nbut little below 10,000 feet. There\nhas been comparatively little wind,\nand as the snow lie3 evenly on the\nsummits, there Is an absence of the\nlarge drifts from which tome the\ngreater part of the spring flow.\nThe bulletin concludes as follows:\n"Of the etreams whose -watersheds\n\'lie wholly within. New Mexico, It is\n\'safe to eav that the present snow sup\ntlv Is not sufficient to keep up the\ncurrent flow, ami unless there Is heavy\nenow soon, or good early rains, the\nsections depending on these are\nihreatened with a serious water fam\nine in the early spring."\nAFTER THE COAL OIL JOHNNIES.\nThe republican machine needs some\nthing- else besides coal oil for smooth\nrunning in the approaching campaign.\nCoal oil isn\'t a good lubricator, any\nhow, particularly the quality of the\narticle being palmed off on the people\nof New Mexico at the present time.\nCapt.

They were\nordered to sell no more of the vile\nEtuff and by obeying the order, they\navoided prosecution.\nCongressman Bailey, of Toxns, !n\nhis speech In opposition to the Puerto\nRican tariff bill, declared that there\nwas Involved in this1 b: if a question\nof law and a question of morals. He\nmade an exhaustive argument against\nthe constitutionality of the bill, arous\ning the lawyers on the oilier side so\nthat for a time he was aUr.QJt contin\nuously engaged in crossing sworCs\nwith one or the other of his adver\nsaries. Mr.Bailey borrowed .the words\nof Lincoln: "This republic cr.nnot\nendure one-half free and onehalf\nelavery.

I\nThe "Advertiser" has elated that\nrepublicans were having trouble with- j\nin the party, and he facta beir out j\nthe statements made, regardless of\nShe daily denials published by the re-\npubHean organs of the Territory.\nThe Bernalillo county republicans\nopposed to Jhe methods of the admin\nistration have less to complain of than\ntheir fellows in Fan Miguel county,\nand yet here we find a widespread dis-;\nsatisfaction. What must be the feci-1\ning in Santa Fe county? Here it was\ngenerally unnecessary for the Otero\nHea to make any particular display\nof force, and the "precinct chairman"\ndid the business. In Santa Fe they\nUf td the deputy sheriffs and the peni\ntentiary guards. The dissatisfied re\npublicans in this county, or a few hun\ndred of them, expressed them-selvea\nin the following language at an in\ndignation meeting in old town:\nResolved, That the republicans of\nseveral precincts of Bernalillo county\nhave been outraged by not being per\nmitted to express their wishes at the\nlaet primaries cf said county.\nResolved, That we the majority of\nBernalillo county republicans protest\nemphatically against such proceedings\nand hereby demand from the central\ncommittee of eaid county our rights\nas citizens and legal voters In all polit\nical and party organizations.\nResolved, That we do not approve\ncf the new method of calling the pri\nmaries, by precinct chairmefn\nand In many Instances have\nplaced notices at 2 o\'clock p. tn. and\nhave called the meeting at 8:30 p. m.,\nand otherwise it has been impossible\nto know the hour at which the meet\ning would be called to order, and there\nby concealing tlie hour. The legal\nvoters are the only ones that have\nthe privilege to elect their lespective\ndelegates. If the same metho.in are\nto follow In the. future, It it! Impossible\nfor our party to have good 8.ilC9S.\nThe people tn general disapprove of\naid proceedings pnd most empliati\ncally protest against them.\nONLY ONE POSTOFFICE.\nThe Little Governor\'s Organ at Santa\nFe Speaks Out.\nFrom the "New Mexican."\nThe Las Vegas daily paper rai.se,\na tempest in a teapot bocai.so it, ir\nproposed to make a change in post\noffice matters in the town of Las\nVegas, and to have but one o3ice lo\ncated conveniently for the ea3t side\nand west side of the town. Several\ncorrespondents Inform the "New Mexi\ncan" that tho sentiment of the business\ncommunity favors this plan. Sonio\npoliticians, and, of course, the post\nmaster, who would be replaced, do not\nfavor it. This is but natural, and was\nto be expected. However, the logic\nof the situation to outsiders, In order\nthat there may be closer business and\nmunicipal relations between the two\nsides, points to one office.\nIn this connection, the Las Vegas\npaper assails Governor Otero. It\ncharges that he is interfering, and\nthat he favors one office for the two\nsides. Fair-minded citizens concede\nthat the governor has a perfect right\nto \'have an opinion Inthe matter and\nto work to carry out what he con\nsiders best for the community; he is\na property owner and a citizen of San\nMiguel county, and has his legal resi\ndence to Las Vegas. The "New Mexi\ncan" does not know what side he takes\nin the controversy, and it cares .not a\ncontinental red cent. But he is cer\ntainly entitled to act as he deem3\nbest, both as a private citizen and as\nan official, in this matter, without be\ning objected to newspaper abuse and\nvilification. And the chance.3 are that\nhe will eo act regardless of unjust\ncriticism and untrue assertions.\nA Plea for a Reading Room.\nTo the Editors of The Optic.\nEast Las Vegas, March 5th, 1900.\nI understand there is a Territorial\nlaw under which citiles are permitted\nto levy a tax for the support of public\nreading rooms. Albuquerque has\nsuch a place which Is In part support\ned by a city tax. With many others. I\nwould like to ee a reading room open\ned here for the benefit of strangers\nand the many single men in town who\nneed a place in which to read, write or\notherwise pass the time. Without\nthis privilege they are often compelled\nto choose between the allurements of\nthe saloons and the discomforts of the\nsidewalks. I believe the reputation\nof the city is Involved In this matter.\nIt should show by the establishment of\na resort of this kind, that It takes an\nInterest in the oomfort and welfare of\npeople who stop here and of the many\nlaboring men who have no comfortable\nhomes in which to rest and enjoy\nthemselves. I suppose a petition signed\nby the. required number of taxpaying\nvoters .would Insure a vote upon the\nquestion at the coming election. Will\nsome one explain through The Op\ntit the course necessary to got it act\ned upon? I think there are many\npeople hero who would help in any\nway possible to get a public reading\nroom opened. - INQUIRER.\n44 The Laborer is \'\nWorthy of His Hire\nBut a ivage-earner can\nget more for his personal ser\nvices if in strong and vigorous\nhealth.
