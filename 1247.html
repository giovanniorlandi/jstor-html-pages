Purnell this\nmorning received a communication\nfrom Frankfort asking the Mason Fis\ncal Court to have a representative at\nFrankfort on next Monday to draw\nfor a truck. All of the counties In the\nstate will be represented at the draw\ning.

MIL\nSOM DELIVERS GREAT\nADDRESS SUGGEST\'\nING MEMORIAL.\nMemorial .Day In Maysvllle was the\ngreatest success this year that it has !\nbeen since the first celebration fol\nlowing the SpantBh-American war.\nThe weather was Ideal and there were\nmany out-of-town people here for the\nday attracted by the unusually attrac\ntive program arranged by the commit\ntee of the Mason County Soldiers and\nSailors Association.\nMaysvllle Cemetery never looked\nbetter. The graves were covered\nwith beautiful flowers and the graves\nof soldiers of the three late wars were\ndecorated with American flags, O. A.\nR. Insignia and Service flags bearing\ngold stars, .\nThe services held at Beech wood\npark were very Impressive. The pro\ngram as previously announced in\nthese columns was carried out almost\nIn Its entirety and every member was\nvery Interesting. The Maysvllle Boys\'\nBand again covered Itself with glory\nand its praise was sung by all in at\ntendance. The other musical numbers\non the program were beautiful. The\nattendance was much better than was\nexpected and the number of country\npeople seen In the audience was sur\nprising. The automobile has brought\nthe country people closer to town and\nalthough there were not many In the\ncity In the morning the park was well\nfilled In the early afternoon.\nSpecial places of honor In the hall\nwere reserved for the veterans of the\nCivil War, the Spanish-American War.\nand the late World War.\nJudge C. D. Newell\'s address was up\nto his high standard and In It he ex\npressed Mason county\'s appreciation\nof her fine young men who made the\nsupreme sacrifice In the great war.\nLieutenant Colonel Samuel M. Wil\nson, of Lexington, was the chief\nspeaker of the afternoon and his ad-j\ndress was greatly enjoyed by the great\naudience in the Beechwood pavllllon.\nAfter expressing his appreciation of\nthe Invitation to speak here on such\nan occasion, Col. Wilson called atten\ntion to the three sided aspect of tho\ncelebration In honor of the heroes of\nour three most recent wars. Colonel\nWilson said that Memorial Day this\nyear takes on an added significance\nsince it la.the first Memorial Day since\nhostilities in the great world war were\nsuspended and said that the meeting\nwas for a two-fold purpose First to\nhonor the heroes of war and second to\nconsider an appropriate memorial\nwith which to perpetuate their mem\nories. He called attention to the fact\nthat similar meetings were being held\nall over the country today and that\nthe same questions were being asked\nin all.\nHe dealt considerably on the causes\nand consequences of the world war\nand said that the folks back home\nshould erect a memorial that would\nbe suitable to memorialize the men\nwho gave their service and even their\nlives.\nHe said our purpose In the lnte war\nwas to make the world safe for Demo\ncracy and that that purpose had not\nyet been fully accomplished although\nIt was on the way to accomplishment.\nHe said the primary cause of the\nworld war was the military policy of\nGermany and that damage had been\novercome but the world has emerged\nfrom the war confronted by another\ndanger even more menacing and this\nIs expressed In doctrines of Bolshe\nvism and all that they imply. It is\nnot confined to Russia but, "like the\nGerman military policy, looks to the\nconquest of the whole world. The only\nway to combat Bolshevism Is by\nAmericanizing the world."\nColonel Wilson said that such a\nmemorial as will represent the won\nderful sacrifice our men have made on\nthe altar of Democracy and as will Im\nprove the memorial and social con\nditions of the community Is the kind\nof permanent memorial that should\nbe erected. He mentioned several\nkinds of permanent memorials adopt\ned by other cities but said from what\nhe had been able to hear a sort of\nCommunity House or \'Club House\nwould fit the needs of Maysvllle and\nMason county better than most any\nthing else. He did not, however, sug\ngest the building of such a memorial\nalthough he said It would be a splen\ndid memorial, that could be used by\nthe community for all times.\nIn regard to state policies, Colonel\nWilson, again said that he waa not\nand would not be a candidate for Gov\nernor. He said, however, that he was\nnot In sympathy with the cry of "too\nmnch pollilca." He said what Ken\ntucky needed Just now was more poll\ntin at the right sort\nDuring his address Colons!

The division trained In Fland\ners with the British and fought side\nby side with .the French In many of\nthe greatest battles of the entire war.\nWhen the armistice was signed the\nLiberty Division was holding the en\ntire front of the First army camped\non the heights facing Sedan.\nColonel Wilson Is a wonderful\nspeaker, a gifted orator and a good\nthinker. The committee was Indeed\nfortunate in procuring him for the\nMaysvllle address and those who\nheard 1)1 in were indeed fortunate. All\nhope that he will come back again.\nMAYSVILLE GIRL WEDS\nCINCINNATI DETECTIVE\nMisses Iva Maddox, daughter of Mr.\nand Mrs. Al Maddox, of East Second\nstreet, was married last night at the\nparsonage of the Union M.

Iu the brief period of a few months four million\nAmerican men dropped their work, left their homes assembled at\narmy camps, were armed, drilled and two-thirds of them sent over\nseas to offer their lives in the service of humanity.\nThey were to achieve this, first, by protecting the honor, dignity\nand independence of their own people; and second, by freeing the\npeople of the world from the tyranny of militarism.\nThe entire American nation enlisted in a mighty crusade of sac\nrifice for the happiness of generations to come. Our peoplr have\ndevelopel a ken sense of justice, a constantly increasing respect for\nthe Golden Rule and a generosity and unselfishness that has exalted\nthe nation in the eyes of the world.\nOur country has been an inspiration and a benediction to peo\nple everywhere who are struggling up toward the light of real lib\nerty. This noble spirit of hunwn service is growing. It is manifest,\ned not only by Americans individuality and collectively, but by the"\ngreat institutions which Americans have organized. One of the\ngreatest of these is the Salvation Army. As the couriers of old se\ncured the right-of-way because of being "in the service of the King",\nso the Salvation Army has secured entrance into millions of Ameri\ncan homes with the watchword "in the service of humanity."\nThe matter of protecting and supporting these brave, unselfish,\nsacrificial people should be a matter of both pride and duty on the\npart of the American people.\nEXPOSING A. FAKE\nStudents of Purdue university, at La Fayette, Indiana, took it\nupon themselves the other day to expose one of their fellow-students\nas a fake hero. The student in question, dismissed from an officers\'\ntraining camp after a trial of a few weeks, never had seen real ser\nvice in the array, but. he had been taken into custody last fall for\nimeprsonating an officer. Not long ago he was seen in Indianapolis\nwalking in a parade of returned Yanks, resplendent in an officers\'\nuniform wits gold service chevrons and a divisional insignia.\n"When the matter was .reported to students of Purdue, they\ndecided that the student was i.ot the kind of young man wanted\nat the university. When he retr.rned from Indianapolis flushed with\nhis trumph there in the role of "returned hero," he was questioned\nas to his conduct and admitted taking part in the parade as an of\nficer and wearing gold chexrons. He was then ducked in a fountain,\na chain was produced and a placard was placed on bis back reading:\n"Fake Army Officer on Way Home". Then the young inn was taken\nto the courthouse steps, was made to confess his fake, and was then\nplaced on a car for Indianapolis, still carrying the chain and wearing\nthe placard, with large yellow stripes adorning his clothes. In this\nstyle he was taken to his home and paraded before his family and\nfriends. Verily, Purdue knows righteous indignation!

Fess, chair\nman of the Republican Congressional\nCommittee, to your correspondent.\n\' "For Instance," continued the Ohio\nman, "be recommends the return of\nthe railroads and wires to private\ncontrol. There can be no quarrel\nwith him la that Immediately after\nthe signing of the Armistice the Re\npublicans began to urge that this be\ndone. At the name time Secretary ol\nthe Treasury McAdoo and Postmaster\nGeneral Burleson were loudly vole-Ins\nan opposite policy. The President\nhimself sided with them.

On the contrary he long\ncontended that It was a question for\nthe states to decide, and It was only\nIn the face of the election of a Re\npublican Congress that he changed\nhis mind. His recommendation In fa\nvor of the repeal of the prohibition\nof wines and beer Is a reversal of the\ncontentions of himself and his party\nseveral months ago, and his attempt\nto put it up to the Republican Con\ngress Is a shrewd move to catch votes\nMilch the voters themselves will\njudge the merits of.

R. Ege)\na the early days of the "Good\nRoads" movement, traffic was confined\nto horse-drawn vehicles, bicycles and\nperhaps a very few motor cart In the\nneighborhood of tome of the larger\ncltlot. People generally appreciated\na good road, and there were many en\ngineers In the country who knew how\nto build them to take care of the traf\nfic which existed at that time. One\nImportant result of highway Improve\nment, however, was not foreseen by J\nthe road builders of that time, and It\nIs a matter which Is frequently over\nlooked or disregarded by present-day\nroad builders. This matter Is the In\'\ncrease In traffic which results from\nthe Improvement of any highway,\nsomewhat similar condition exists In\na town where there have been\ngood sidewalks, People will not leave\ntheir homes or move about except\nwhen necessity compels. When the\nsldewalkB have been provided and\ngood crossings built, the result Is that\npeople move about within the city\nmore freely and living conditions ac\ncordingly are improved. The same\nthing happens when a highway Is lni\nproved. Without any Increase In the\npopulation or perhaps In the produc\ntlve capacity in a dlstrlctq, the mere\nfact that a road has been built which\nwill be reasonably free from mud or\ndust will Induce people to move about\nmore. This encourages trade and is\nvery generally recognized as an Im\nportant factor in Improved living and\ntrade conditions\nOn this account It frequently hnp\npens that In the case of a road which\nhas been heretofore left largely to\nthe mercy of the elements, and has\nperhaps no other surface except the.\nIriginal soil, and which Is Improved\nwith a treatment of gravel or maca\ndam, the builders are astonished and\ndismayed by the fact that the traffic\nincreases beyond their anticipation,\nand as a result the surface that has\nbeen provided. Is entirety inadequate\nto take care of the travel that Is de\nshould be very carefully considered by\nany community planning highway Im\nprovements.\nIt is an old story now that the au\ntomobile has put the old-time gravel\nand macadam roads out of business,\nKeeping pace with the demands of\ncommerce, the motor manufacturers\nhave developed the truck to a point\nwhere Its Use Is of great economic\nsaving to all classes of commece. The\nwear up a highway that results from\nmotor truckca and automobile travel\nIs not so much the result of abrasion\nas it Is the result of Impact. The\nmotor truck has come to stay because\nit Alls a definite requirement In our\neconomic existence, and It has put up\nto the highway builders of the coun\ntry to provide a surface which is ca\npable of carrying this traffic, which\nIs rapidly increasing in volume and in\nweight. The answer of highway build\ners to this development has been the\nrigid type of pavement which is best\nemphasized by the modern one-course\ncement concrete pavement Anyone\nwho has observed the effects of mo\ntor truck traffic over unpaved high\'\nways has noticed that the driving\nwneeis very quicxiy develop any\nweak spots than may exist in the road\nThese must be Immediately repaired\nor they will shortly become so exten\nslve In area as to constitute an ob\nstacle, preventing the further use of\nthat highway by trucks, or Indeed any\nother form of vehacle.\nConcrete pavements for highways\nhave long since passed the experimen\ntal stage. Improvement in methods\nof construction and details of design\ncontinue to be developed, as well be\ntrue of any type of structure, but the\nfundamental principles have now been\nso thoroughly understood for a num\nber of years that a definite practice\nhas been developed which can be\ncounted upon to render true values\nfor the Investment,\nThe first section of the county to\nbuild concrete highways on a large\nscale was Wayne county, Michigan, of\nwhich Detroit is \'the seat. Beginning\nIn the year 1909, the authorities of this\ncounty have followed a plan of high\nway development which was original\nly conceived In 1907, and year by year\nthey have added to the paved sections\nof this system until now it it nearly\ncomplete so far at the trunk lines are\nconcerned, and a number of the sec\nondary or connecting lines have also\nbeen paved with concrete. These au\nthorities have found no reason to de\npart from the type of pavement orig\ninally selected.\nWoodward avenue, one of the main\nthoroughfares radiating from Detroit\nwas first paved with with concrete 16\nft wide In 1909. This pavement Is\nstill in service despite the fact that\nthe traffic has developed to a point\nwhere the width Is no longer sufficient\nbut the pavement Itself gives promise\nof many more yean of excellent ser\nvice. Thlt particular etretch of high\nway was\' built of concrete of a leaner\nmixture than It now used and many\nof the present-day refinements were\nomitted. Since thlt original pave-\nment, now In Its tenth year and giv\ning promise of many more years of\nservice, hat been to satisfactory, we\ncan safely draw the conclusion that\nthe pavements built In years since, of\nmuch better materials end richer In\ncement, can be expected to render\nfrom 30 to 40 years of service end.\npossibly more.\nTIM IS THE TtST\nThe Teidmony of Xejirlflo People\nStandi the Test.\ni\nThe test of Ume It what tellt the\ntale.

Foster-Milburn\nCo., Mfgrs.. Buffalo. N. Y.\nProfiting by the experience of\nWayne county and other section\nwhere concrete highways have been\nIn use for many years, road builders\nnow advocate a paved width of not\nless than 18 ft. for main line high\nways carrying heavy traffic and a\nwidth of 20 ft. wherever it 1b at all\npossible to make the necessary addi\ntional Investment. The ordinary mo\ntor car Is slightly more than 6 ft. in\nwidth and the average motor truck\nIs apt to be somewhat wider than\nthat; thus, It Is seen that a pavement\nhaving a width of but 16 ft. does not\ngive a very comfortable margin at\nclearance when vehicles pass each\nother at speeds above 15 or 20 miles\nper hour.\nThe present standard practice de\nvelops the fact that a concrete pave\nment mixed in the proportions of 1\nVolume of cement, 2 volumes of sand\nand 3 volumes of stone should have\na thickness of 6 in. at the edge of\nthe pavement and 8 in the center.\nThis gives a curved surface or\ncrown" as it Is techlcally called,\nwhich sheds the water perfectly and\nstill Is so imperceptible that no dis\ncomfort is occasioned to occupants of\nvehicles driving on the road at the\nhigher speeds.\nThe question is often raised as to\nwhether the necessary investment to\npave with concrete all of the connect\ning highways of a given county is a\ngood one or not. An answer to tills\nIs found in some recent tests which\nwere conducted by the Portland Ce\nment Association with the co-operation\nof the White Motor Car Co. on\nthe highways near Cleveland. Sever\neral sections of highway were select\ned, some of which were natural earth\nroads in good condition, others were\nsurfaced with gravel, macadam and\nother types of surfacing un to the\nmodern concrete pavements. A string\nof five 2-ton trucks were used in this\nseries of tests, and the results In gaso\nline consumption were averaged for\nrepeated runs by all five vehicles over\nall of these different sections of high\nway. The economy In operation of\ntrucks over the different pavements\nIs disclosed by the average mileages\nobtained from a gallon of gasoline\nIt was found that on the ordinary dirt\nroad In good condition the average of\nall the tests was 5.78 miles per gallon\nwhile on the concrete pavements 11.78\nmiles were obtained from a gallon of\nfuel. A very marked difference was\nnoted In the case of the gravel and\nmacadam surfaces, all of which were\nIn fair condition, although of course\nthey gave a better mileage than was\nobtained on the earth road,\nThese tests confirm In a striking\nway similar results obtained by ex\ntensive tests of the Federal Truck Co.,\nand they also folloV very closely re\nsuits of tests by Professor J. B. David\nson of the California College of Agrl\'\nculture, which were made near Sacra\nmento in 1917. It Is thus shown that\nthe fuel consumption necessary to\nmove motor propelled traffic over Con\ncrete paved roads Is less than half\nthat required to move It over ordi\nnary dirt and gravel roads. Motor\ntruck operators of a community or\nstate can afford to pay Increased li\ncenses, at least an amount equal to\nthis saving In fuel cost, as a sinking\nfund to-retlre the Interest and prln\ncipal on the cost of the Improvement\nof highways. They will still be ahead\nof the game by reason of the savings\nin tires, wear and tear on the ma\nchines and the saving of time that is\neffected by reason of being able to\nmake better speeds. This Is exactly\nthe principle that is being applied\nIn the case of the great $60,000,000\nhighway bond issue of Illinois. One\nof the favorite arguments that used\nto be advanced for good roads was the\nconvenience to the farmer and the In\ncreased ppportunlty to market his\nproducts. This argument Is just as\ngood at ever, but perhaps you may\nnot ell be familiar with the way It It\nworking out. We find In those com\nmunities which have paved all of\ntheir main highways, developments In\nthlt respect which have never been\nanticipated: for example, Indianapolis\ntho seat of Marlon county, baa a large\npacking industry and stock yards\nwhich drawa Its supply of Hve stock\nfrom tho surrounding territory. The\nhighways have boon\'pavod to a Very\nlarge eUsnt, and the \' farmers and\nmotor truck operators have beel quick\nto take advantage of thlt fact by\nfitting their truckt with bodies suit\nable for handling live ttock. The anl\nmalt are hauled to town over the con\ncrete roadt and dellvored to the stock\nyards In good condition and with no\nloss In weight, whereas every stock\nraiser knows that beef animals will\nloso many pounds while being driven\na few miles to market.\nThis cluss of truffle has developed\nso extensively that the Union Stock\nYards at Indianapolis has built special\nfacilities for unloading stock from\nmotor trucks, and a large proportion\nof their supply Is received In this\nmanner. What is known as a Return\nLoads Dureau has been developed to\nfacllllute keening the motor trucks\n(11 led to capacity In both directions;\nfor example, a frrmor or a truck con\ntractor leaves a point 20 mile from\nIndianapolis with a load or live beef.\nBefore he starts to town he calls up\nthe Hetu- Loads Bureau In Indiana-\npolls and advises them that he expects\nto reach town and unload his stock at\na certain time, and that his equipment\nwill then be available for any cargo\nthat may be offered traveling In the\ndirection of his home from Indiana-\npolls. The Return\' Loads Bureau,\nwhile Mr. Farmer Is "on his way to\ntown, finds out what commodities may\nbe offered for shipment in the direc\ntion of this farmer\'s home, and noti\nfies shippers that a truck will be\nready to take the goods at a certain\ntime, and when the afrmer reaches the\ncity he Is advised of the opportunity\nto secure a full load on the way back,\nHe thus utllizec his equipment to full\ncapacity and to the mutual advantage\nof himself, the Union Stock Yards and\nthe various shippers of Indianapolis.\nThe service is far better than was the\nease when the outlying communities\nwere entirely dependent upon steam\nand electric railways, and is made\npossible only by the radiating high\nways of concrete,\nSimilar developments have taken\nplace In other parts of the country.\nThe Rural Motor Express has become\na reality and affords the country pro\nducer an opportunity to transform\ncertnln parts of his output into cash\nwhich formerly were only partly utjr\nIzed, or at best served only his own\nfamily, and perhaps a limited number\nof neighbors.\nBy reason of the highway systems\nInter-city freight lines utilizing motor\ntrucks, operate over large areas from\nsuch centers as Boston, New York,\nBuffalo, Cleveland, CVoliimbus, Chi\ncago, aKnsas City, Denver, Salt Lake,\nSacramento, San Francisco, Los An\n?eles, Portland, Tacoma and Seattle,\nThe developments along this line In\nCalifornia are particularly interesting.\nThe great Sacramento Valley is rap-\nIdly being grldironed with concret\'\nroads. As a result the early mornlni\nhours In all of the little farming cen\nters see great motor truck loads with\ntrailers behind them of from appro\nprating money for mode traveled\nroads and feel more satisfied with\ntheir Investment.\nGO. fOXEY 0\' DECK AC.UJf\nWashington Foreseeing that an\'\nother period of unemployment like\nthat of the Cleveland administration\nand the first two years of the Wilson\nadministration is about to prevail\nGeneral Coxey, who rode up to the\nCapitol at the head of a large follow\ning of hoboes 25 years ago, is here\nagain to tell Congress how to get work\nfor everybody.\nThe General has prepared a bill, In\ntroduced by Representative Sherwood,\na sterling old Democrat of Ohio,\nwhich is calculated to work like ning\nIc and Bolve the entire problem.

McAdoo, chairman of the\nCitizens\' National Committee behind\nthe Boys\' Scout movement has Issued\nthe following public appeal to parents:\nTO THE MOTHERS AND FATHERS\nOF AMERICAN ,BOYS:\nThe Congress of the United States,\nrecognizing the value of proper train\ning of American boyhood, granted a\nspecial charter for the organization of\nthe Boy Scouts of America. This or\nganization now embraces 375,000\nsplendid American boys; but this\' Is a\nvery small proportion of the 10,000,000\nAmerican boys between the ages of\ntwelve and twenty-one who ought to\nbe given the benefit of Boy Scout dis\ncipline, training and practice.\nThe future of the Nation depends,\nof course, upon its youth. The fath\ners and mothers of American boys will\nbe gravely derelict In, parental duty\nand In National obligation If they fail\nto give their hearty support, moral and\nfinancial, to this great American Boy\nScout movement. Not only is every\nBoy Scout given useful knowledge and\ntraining which equips him better for\nthe battle of life Itself, but there are\nInculcated in him the duties, obliga\ntions, Ideals and higher conceptions of\nAmerican citizenship.\nEach year the Boy Scout movement\nIs turning out thousands of better boys\nand creating the finest types of future\nAmerican patriots. No cause should\nappeal more strongly to the mothers\nand fathers of America than the Boy\nScout cause.\nThe Boy Scouts raised several hun\ndred million dollars In the Liberty\nLoan and War Savings Stamps cam\npaigns. They did splendid work for\nthe Red Cross, in Its several Nations\ncampaigns. They served the Govern\nment In many other effective ways dur\ning the great world war. It Is an or\nganization of gallant patriots and de\nserves the Encouragement and support\nof the Nation.\nThe week beginning June 8 and end\ning June 14 has been set apart as Boy\nScout week for the purpose of enlarg\ning and strengthening the Boy Scout\norganization. Associate memberships\nIn the Boy Scout organization will be\noffered to the mothers and fathers of\nAmerican boys and to other adult\nAmerican citizens. This, If success\nful, will provide a supporting adult\norganization to the Boy Scouts of\nAmerica which will assure the en\nlarged usefulness and effectiveness of\nthe Boy Scout movement Surely there\nare five million American men and wo\nmen\' who are willing to help the boys\nof America to become the best of all\nAmerican ciyzelg. Surely there are\nmillions of other American citizens\nwho are willing to contribute a small\nsum to put the Boy Scout organization\non a strong and permanent basis\nwhich will assure thecontlnuoustraln\nIng of the youth of America In the\nOner ideals and conceptions of citizen\nship In the greater democracy on\nearth.\nThis worthy cause stands alonrslde\nthe Red Cross and other humanitarian\norganizations which have had the gen\nerous support of the American people.\nIn the name of America\'s best boyhood,\nI beg America\'s manhood and woman\nhood to help.\nW.

Such modifications\nof the peace treaty as may be made in\nresponse to Germany\'s final counter\nproposals probably will be limited to\nthe economic, reparation and terri\ntorial sections, It was learned from an\nauthoritative source today.\nGermany\'s contentions regarding\nplebiscite for upper Silesia are under\nstood to be the subject of spoclal con\nBiuerotion by the allies. There are\nmany responsible persons, too, who\nadmit the economic provisions are at\nleast "pretty stuff."\nThe reparation plan has been crlti\nelzed freely. Many allied peace dele\ngates are known to feel, as the Ger\nmans declare, that the reparations\nclause should name a specific amount\nrather than take on the nature of a\nblank check, although there Is no dls\nposition to agree with the enemy that\nthe amount should be only $25,000,\n000,000. There appears to be little likeli\nhood that Germany Immediately will\nbe admitted to the League of Nations,\nas the counter-proposals demand. In\nthis connection It can be stated au\nthoritatively that there Is absolutely\nno chance of her ever entering the\nleague with a mandate over her for\nmer colonies.

The sinner trusts Ood\nfor pardon, the ChrlHtlan trusts Ood\nfor success In his work, for protection\nfrom the assaults of Salon, for victory\nover the world and the flesh, and for\nsuccess in his work. The faith of this\nlosson Is the faith of the Christian\nnot of the sinner. Fulth Is not the\ngift of God, but Is the act of the crea\nture. It is man\'s confidence in Ood.\nThe heroes of this lesson believed\nGod. When God told Noah that he\nwould destroy every living thing with\na flood, he believed him, and showed\nhis faith by proceeding to build an ark\naccording to God\'s directions. When\nGod told Abraham that he would make\na great nation from his loins he be\nlieved him and his faith led him to\nobey every command that God gave.\nTho sinner goes to God for the pardon\nof his sins, lie confesses them to God,\nforsakes or (in its them, and believing\nthe promise, "Whosoever shall call\nupon the Lord shall be saved," he\nprays and Is saved or pardoned, and\nGod gives him the holy spirit In wit\nness of that fact.

He\ntakes God\'s word as his guide, reads\nthe promises, believes them, and God\ngives him. overcoming power. With\nout implicit faith in God to give him\nthis power he does not receive it.\nThe worthies recorded In this ele\nventh chapter of Hebrews were suc\ncessful la their undertakings because\nof their faith In God.

The signifi\ncance of Memorial day this year, the\nfirst since the close of the war, was In\nterpreted in statements by Secretaries\nBaker and Wilson. "The spiritual\nprogress of America," said Secretary\nUaker, "is shown by our addition of\nfresh glory to this day, set apart to\nmemoralize the nation\'s heroic dead.\nThere Is no division of Its ancient sig\nnificance, but fresh meaning is added\nby those who have died on foreign soil\nto perpetuate the liberties for which\ntheir ancestors gave their lives at\nhome."\nSecretary Wilson appealed to the\nlabor forces of the country especially\nto recognize that It Is their "privilege\nto carry on the work" for which the\nnation\'s heroes have died.\nBARACA CLASS\nMuch Interest Is being shown in the\nenlistment plan started by the Tlaraca\nClass of the First Baptist Church.\nLast Sunday a number of recruits\nwere brought In by several of the\ncompany captains and lieutenants. C.\nS. Kirk, the teacher, gave a strong,\nvirile talk on repentance, at the last\nmeeting.
