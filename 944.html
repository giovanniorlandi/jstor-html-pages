CARSON, Ticket Agent, CALEB CORSER, Superintendent, JOB PRINTING, Promptly and Artistically Done, —At—, Daily Times Office, Drop In or Telephone Your Order, NEW FLYING, MACHINE GOES, STRAIGHT UP, DAYTON, Feb. 15. — What is de, clared to be the first successful heli, copter ever constructed in the United, States is undergoing a series of rigid, tests at McCook Field, in this city., It represents an expenditure of, $200,000 by the United States Govern, ment, and the fact that it rises verti, cally from the ground and has re, mained in the air for one minutes and, 40 seconds, according to official an, nouncement, leads to the prediction of, scientists and engineers at McCook, Field that it will soon be brought to, a stage of development making it prac, tical for aerial transportation., The announcement issued by the, United States Army Air Service calls, attention to the fact that it was just, twenty years and one day from the, time that Wright Brothers made their, first flight, which covered a period of, but fifty-nine seconds, that Dr. George, De Bothezaat, Russian inventor, real, ized fulfillment of his dreams of ris, ing vertically., The honor of making the initial, flight with a helicopter went to I, Major Thurman II. Bane, Commandant |, at McCook Field, who has since re-', tired., The official announcement of the, first successful operation of the trial, flight was not issued until January 13,, whereas the flight took place on De, cember 18., Secretly Built, Development of this new aircraft, was carried on in secret. A special, hangar was erected at McCook Field, j, screens were erected about windows,, and entrances, and an armed guard I, was maintained all the time in order j, to prevent prying eyes from seeing j, what was going on., However, with the successful flight j, the veil of secrecy was lifted and a, month later the great secret was given j, to the world., Dr. De Bothezaart began work on j, the helicopter at McCook Field in j, July, 1921. He was assisted by engi-;, neers and technical men at the field. |, but the principles along which the i, helicoper was constructed were his j, own, and he is recognized as the ac-;, tual builder of the plane in the Army, Air Service announcement., It is declared that the newly per, fected heavier-than-air craft will rev, olutionize the science of aviation in, that it rises straight from the ground, and can then be made soar away in j, any direction. I, 1, Safety and Stability, The inherent stability of the ship,, it is claimed, renders it much safer, than ordinary airplanes in that it can, be glided to the ground from any alti, tude with a minimum of danger., It has four propellers, with a com, bined blade area of 900 square feet., Those are operated by a 170 horse, power motor., During the tests now being made at, McCook Field it is expected to at, tempt an endurance flight. An effort;, will also be made to set an altitude, record., Even before the United States en, tered the war experiments were con, ducted in the hope of producing a heli, copter. None, however, proved suc, cessful until December 18, when the, De Bothezaart helicopter made its, maiden flight., Among the men of prominence who, have seen the new machine in action, are Major-General Mason J. Patrick,, Chief of the Air Service; General Wil, liam Mitchell, his aide, and the only, flying general in the world; Newton, Dr. Baker, former Secretary of War;, Herbert Hoover. Secretary of Com, merce; Colonel E. A. Deeds, head of, the Aircraft Production Board dur, ing the war, and C. F. Kettering, who, contributed many scientific inventions, to aircraft during the war. His chief, contribution was an automatic air, plane capable of dropping a bomb on, any spot within a radius of 80 miles., This automatic plane was a strict war, secret, and very little if anything has, ever been published about it for the, reason that the war ended three, months too soon for it to be put to, a test on the western front. I, EMPRESS, milit i npnr1 tonight, IHMmE At 8 sharp, Thomas Meighan, -IN, “White and, Unmarried”, A Romance of a Dashing Yankee, Bachelor Who Started Out to “Do”, Paris—and Did!, -ALSO, “ASSORTED HEROES”, Two Reels of Laughs, The announcement concerning,, the, helicopter, as issued by the United, States Army Air Service, says:, “The first flight of the De Botlie, zaart helicopter was made by Major, Thurman H. Bane, Commandant at, McCook Field (who has since retired),, December IS, at 9:30 a. m. The total |, duration was about two minutes, and j, the highest altitude reached was 10 j, feet., “The start was directly upward, and j, every ascent and descent was made j, without the slightest outside assist-1, ance. The whole flight was steady j, and the landing very smooth., “In the air it demonstrated the, highest grade of inherent stability, j, It was witnessed by officers and em- j, ployes at McCook Field., “The building of the De Bothezaat, helicopter was started in July, 1921. j, and done under secret direction of, the United States Air Service Divi, sion., In order to appreciate the full, meaning of this performance it is well, to remember that the first airplane, flight made by Wright Brothers on, December 17, 1903, lasted only fifty, nine seconds. It is interesting to note, that the city of Dayton, the birthplace, of the first successful airplane, has, now produced the first successful heli-;, copter., “It is also worthy of mention that |, the helicopted was built at McCook, Field, without any preliminary tests,, on the sole basis of computation made, by Dr. De Bothezaat, and based on his, two propeller theories, published by, the National Advisory Committee at, Washington., “The behavior of the helicopter in, the air demonstrated in fullest man, ner what important results can be ob, tained by adequate scientific meth, ods.”, Dr. De Bothezaat is an international, figures in aeronautical and scientific, circles. He has been interested in, aviation for the last 15 years. He has, published books and papers on sci, entific subjects for 40 years. He is, the author of the first book on air, plane mechanics, published in Paris, in 1911., A number of his airplane inventions, are in use at McCook Field and other, air stations., ABOUT ADVERTISING, If you are not advertising, then ad, vertise because it saves money for, you and it reduces the price to the, customer., Advertising prevents profiteering., It insures honest profits and makes, them permanent., All progressive American business, men advertise., Tell the public about your goods., The easiest, quickest and most eco, nomical way in which this can be ac, complished is by advertising, and the, best place to advertise is in The Cor, dova Daily Times., NENANAITES PROTEST, WHITE PASS MONOPOLY, If reports received recently to the, effect, that all the Mayo silver ore, is to pass through Nenana during the, coming summer, mean that the White, Pass steamers are to return to the, Tanana river, to the exclusion of all, other boats on the upper Yukon, the, News fails to see wherein conditions, along the river ahe to be greatly im, proved over last season. It will mean, a great deal to the Alaska Railroad, to get the Mayo tonnage, which went, out by way of St. Michaels last sea, son; but if such an arrangement, means that Government boats will, aiot operate in competition with the, White Pass, that the foreign steamers, will be allowed to charge confiscatory, rates on necessary supplies and oper, ate on schedules as irregular as they, were last summer on the Yukon river,, settlements and mining communities, along the upper Yukon will not share, in the benefits resulting from oper, ation of the Government railroad., KAISER’S DENTIST DEAD, YPSILANT1, Mich., Feb. 15. — Dr., Lee Waiting, former Ypsilanti dentist,, who went to Germany 22 years ago, and was for years dentist to the fam, ily of former Kaiser Wilhelm Hohen, zollern, is dead in Munich, according, to word received here., Fishermen are wanted to operate our newest, T7* 1 * ] Automatic No Bait Fishing Traps.

Church, London, correspondent, quotes George Bernard, Shaw as declaring that world events,, in traveling their customary “vicious, cycle,” are tending toward tyranny, again., », LONDON, Feb. 15.—“Everybody is, tired of Democracy,” says George, Bernard Shaw, who declares that the, world is always traveling in a vicious, circle and is now again tending to, wards a period of tyranny., "We have arrived at a strange, point in the history of Europe,”, Shaw says. “Consider the teachings, of history. First oligarchy, then de, mocracy, then tyranny, then a threat, of the break-up of civilization. Then,, again ilograchy, and democracy, and, tyranny, combined with a large prole, tariat maintained by doles. The, vicious circle is coming around again., Women got the vote, and the im, mediate result was the disastrous, election in 1918., “What are we going to do about, it all? Can we avoid these intoler, follies? Can we get a good govern, ment by the system of democracy?, Somebody once described democarcy, as ‘government of the people, by the, people, for the people.’ That is ail, nonsense. To talk of the people, making their own laws is as prepos, terous as talking of the people writ, ing their own plays, which nobody, would go to see., “People don’t want to be gov, erned. The reason why we are slaves, in this country is because we are, so desperately determined to get rid, of the government which is neces, sary to preserve our freedom. A new !, government is taking hold in Great j, Britain. Do you think that the, people will win? Nine-tenths of the, Ministry consists of people who know, nothing whatever about it. We are, again drifting towards an iligarchy,, set up for five years. It is not sat, isfactory. It is no good., “What is the answer? I can give, only one. I don’t, know., “I do not believe that democracy,, as rt present constituted, will en, dure.” i, Great Britain is long on museums, and antiques are cherished, but it, took the Sunday Express, ardent sup, porter of Bonar Law, to turn up the, history of the most unique of an, tiques.

These historic trousers,, the Express states with all solemnity,, have been discovered in St. Louis,, N. B., and were made from a cast, off pair of truosers once belonging, to the^ev. James Law, Presbyterian, minister and father of the present, Prime Minister. And yet, George, Berenard Shaw says that England is, growing tired of Democracy, while, a newspaper searches for the first, pair of trousers ever worn by an, Empire\'s Premier., London landlords have recently, raised the ban against children, but, now they threaten to extend the, ban to radio outfits. The St. Pan, eras Estates Committee recommends, that applications from tenants shall, specifically state that the tenants, will not install any wireless appar, atus. The committee states that it, has taken this action on the advice, of insurance experts, who charge that, amateur radio fittings may cause, fires., Bolshevism is due to bad teeth,, at least that is the theory of Major, Chapman Huston, one of London’s, leading men in the dental world., “I have never seen a Bolshevik with, other than bad teeth,’’hesaid.

His sec, retaries are making inquiries con, cerning the possibilities of an Ameri, can lecture tour.

This measure should be sup, ported by everyone in Alaska, for it would, mean a great deal in the development of the, Territory if it should become law., It is of more importance even than the, first appropriation, for it would mean that, Alaska would probably be recognized then, for all time in the Federal road aid bill, which,, it appears will annually have larger appropri, ations. It is true that if such an appropri, ation should be granted Alaska that the, monev, or the greater part of it would go to, the great mainland to the North, to points, along the railroad and along the Richardson, highway. But even so, Southeastern Alaska, would be directly benefitted, and if it were, not, the people of the Panhandle should sup, port it for the general good of the Territory., At the present time, Southeastern Alaska,, in the matter of roads is provided for better, than the rest of the Territory, through its, national forest funds. An attempt has been, made, and is being made, to divert some of, these funds to points along the Government, railroad—a thing that would be an outrage, on the First Judicial Division—but neverthe, less a thing that is being attempted and hav, ing some strong backing which must be com, batted., If the Sutherland amendment to the Fed, eral highway bill should be enacted and bo, come part of the original measure it would, mean that the great mainland to the north, would be so will taken care of that neither, it nor its proponents would then care to take, anvthing awav from the First Division., The Government has spent upwards ot, $56,000,000 for a railroad from tidewater to, the Interior, the interest on which, at 4 per, cent, is approximately two and one-quarter, million dollars a year. It is probable that the, railroad, for a considerable period of time,, will require additional appropriations of at, least a million dollars a year to take care of, the deficiency in the cost of operation, making, a total annual expense of three and one-quarter, million dollars to the people of the United, States. It would appear that the people, pav, ing this amount, would want to get rid of that, burden just as soon as possible, and the only, way that ever can be done will be by building, feeders of wagon roads and trails and aiding, in the development of the adjacent country., The passage of this Federal road bill to, apply to Alaska would mean that in a few, years the Territory would be so built up,, mining and agriculture would be so stimu, lated that the railroad, instead of being in, the red, would be ready to pay Uncle Sam, a dividend, and Southeastern Alaska would, be free from the attempts to rob it of the, fruits of its national forest., Of course, there are those who think that, this meausre will not pass. They may bo, right, but if it is introduced every year, and, year after year, concurrently with the Federal, road aid bill it will ultimately be given favor, able consideration by some Congress. Once it, is inserted in the bill, it will stay there an, nually., An illustration of what persistence will do, in the way of securing desired legislation was, the experience of the man who is now head, of the consular service of the United States,, in the State Department. Every year, for, fifteen years or thereabouts he had intro, duced in Congress a bill touching the con, sular service. Each year it was turned down,, and again the next session up it popped again, until finally the department found a Congress, which was sufficiently friendly to pass it., So, it should be with the Federal aid road, bill. Alaska should have the measure before, every Congress and before every session of, Congress until it becomes part of the measure,, and until Alaska reaps the harvest, whereby, the United States, in turn, will reap a larger, harvest later., Alaska must have roads, and roads and, more roads. Otherwise it will stand as it has, stood for twrenty years, showing little progress., —Ketchikan Chronicle., ACTION BY THE CREDITORS, •, The Wall Street Journal says: If France, can make the occupation of the Ruhr Valley, effective she may he doing the greatest pos, sible service to the German Government. She, may even enable that government to take, some small share in the financing of Germany., The factories of the Ruhr Valley, including, those of Essen, are not at present operated, for Germany, and still less with any idea of, devoting a part of the profits to the payment, of taxes in real money. Those profits arc, controlled from centers outside of Germany, by Germans, through the working capital, which has been removed to points beyond the, reach of the German tax gatherer., Ever since the Armistice it has been said, and reiterated in these columns that a straight, forward, business-like receivership for Ger, many was the safe and certain cure for the, most vital part of the disease from which, Europe now suffers. The French and British, in their view of reparations are not far apart., The British want to see business relations re, stored and are willing to trust the Germans, after the expiration of a moratorium. The, French believe that after that moratorium, the Germans will simply raise all the old, obstacles to the payment of even a small part, of their just debts. Their view of German, character is, to put it mildly, amply justified, by experience., A limited number of immensely ■wealthy fi, nanciers and industrialists, bankers who con, trol the substantial financial business of, Germany, captains of industry like Sti lines, who direct her production outside of the raw, materials produced by the farms, are in a, position today to guarantee Germany a far, larger gold loan than anything hitherto pro, posed. Being utterly devoid of principle,, sportsmanship, pride in national reputation for, veracity and solvency, these interests have, laid out for themselves a plain course, looking, to the ultimate extinction of all claims for, reparations. They mean to pay nothing. V hen, that solution has been accepted their capital, will be returned to Germany, the mark and, the internal debt alike will be wiped out, the, state and municipal debts will be scaled down, to nominal figures, and Germany, within five, years, will occupy the strongest financial po, sition in Europe., To do this they must be able to supply raw, materials from the outside, to sell the fin, ished product in a world market at the gilt, edged exchange rates their capital in New, York and elsewhere can command, conducting, production in Germany on a paper basis which, must ultimately ruin the worker and the farm, er but will make them fabulously rich. Franco, has thrown a monkey wrench into this ingen, iously constructed machinery. Tn the Ruhr, district at least this humane process of arteri, otomy will be no longer possible. Germany *s, not going to war about it. She has not the, means, she has not the pretext, and so far, as her own working people are concerned, she, has not the inclination., It is not a fighting proposition and the, occupied area is the most prosperous part of, Germany today. No well-informed person be, lieves the German protestations or accepts the, German pledges, if only for the reason that, the German Government has nothing to pledge., Rut the German exploiters have something to, pledge and the French are taking over part, of it, for the benefit of the creditors. Every, obstacle we throw in their way will play into, the hands of the worst element in Germany, and postpone by just so much the final settle, ment we desire., A regular crab travels backward—but he travels., His human prototype never gets anywhere., Many a man has a reputation for being a genius, who, gets a good laugh out of it when he is alone., Whether you are up and coming, or out and going,, is indicated by whether your conversation is about now, or then., OFFICE CAT, ▼ RAOC MARK, BY JUNIUS, COPYRIGHT 1921, BY COOAR ALLAN MOBS., THE GOAT, “By Bat”, Mother goes to (lances,, So does Sister Ann;, Lawd how they can fox trot,, With another man., Daddy buys the tickets,, Does the best he can;, Everybody steps at our house, But our old man., It is the little things that count,, the little smiles, the little kiss and, the little words of love., -♦, It is easy to be deceived in an egg., Good eggs and bad eggs look alike., A bady one looks as good as a good, one., “The woman pays," we are always, told.

Joe Bernard of the, Teddy Bear Projects, Big Trip, BUT MIGHT WINTER THERE, Wooden Leg Made by, Eskimos Among Latest, Collection Relics, A Nome - to - Newfoundland trip, through the Arctic will be made this, year if his plans go through, accord, ing to Captain Joe Bernard of the, Teddy Bear, who is in New York to, arrange for the exhibition of relics of, Sir John Franklin’s ill-fated Arctic, expedition and archeological material, from prehistoric Eskimo graves in, Victoria Land and in North Siberia,, according to the New York Times., John B. Burnham, President of the, American Game Protective Associa, tion, is assisting in the effort to or, ganize a west-to-east expedition, through the Arctic., One of the relics of Sir John Frank, lin’s expedition consists of parts of a, copper boom from one of his ships, which was found in possession of an, Eskimo on Adelaide Peninsula, which, is at a point about three-quarters of, the journey from Bering Straits, on, the Pacific side, to Baffin Bay, on the, Atlantic. Another relic is a wooden, arrow box made by Eskimos from, wood from a ship in a relic expedi, tion sent after Franklin, who perished, in 1848. Another strange relic of, early British expeditions reported by, Captain Bernard was a bit of applied, science. It was a wooden leg manu, factured roughly for himself by an, eskimo on Adelaide Peninsula, his an, cestors having learned the trick from, members of the expedition of Sir, James C. Ross, who explored in the, Arctic in 1828., A Veteran Arctic Trader, Captain Bernard has been trading, and making archeological and anthro, pological collections among the Es, kimos for twenty seasons. He is said, to have covered more mileage in the, Arctic than any man living. His great, est collection, numbering 8,000 pieces,, is in the museum of the University of], Pennsylvania. Other collections made, by him are in the city at the Museum, of American Indian, Heye Foundation:, at the Loyola College at Ottawa, and, elsewhere. Edward Arnold ■ of Mon, treal has a large private collection, containing many Arctic treasures bar, tered from natives or excavated by, Captain Bernard, who is by a wide, margin the greatest individual hunt, er of material of this kind in the, North., His most interesting recent collec, tion contains weapons and utensils, from ancient graves on Victoria Land, in the Arctic. These are believed to, prove that the early Victoria Land In, dians belonged to the Chuckchee tribe, of Siberia, who also bury their dead in, stone-lined graves with heads pointing, east., Captain Bernard hopes to make up, a party of three or four sportsmen, and one motion picture man for the, proposed Nome-to-Newfoundland trip., The west-to-east passage of the Arc, tic has never been accomplished. In, the other direction the passage has, been made by one man—Amundsen., The water route through the Arctic, north of Canada was discovered by, Sir John Franklin, but he perished on, the trip., Two Alternating Trips, The Arctic pilot said that he was, ready to attempt the trip in either one, or two ways—a quick dash with the, purpose of completing the trip in one, summer, or a more leisurely journey,, wintering on Victoria Land or some, other part of the Arctic, hunting polar, hear while the light lasts, taking mo, tion pictures and listening to music,, news and bedtime stores from WJZ., “If conditions are favorable, it, would be possible to leave Nome on, July 15 to reach Newfoundland in the, latter part of September or early in, October,” he said. “If we started in, tending to make the trip in one sum, mer, I think we would have about an, even chance of getting through. If, ice conditions were bad, as they were, last summer, it would be necessary, to go into winter quarters., “I would take one native on the trip,, and the passengers could not number, more than three or four. They would, have to act as the crew and do their, share of the work.”, The party would have to live large, ly on the country. Their diet would, vary, according to the position where, they located. Fat reindeer is the, best meat in the North and thin rein, deer about the poorest, according to, Captain Bernard. Next to fat rein, deer the highest living in the Arctic,, he said, was wolf, whose meat was, lean streaked with fat, having the, flavor of fine lamb. Varied fare of, this kind would be possible if the, party camped on the coast of the con, tinent, whereas polar bear would be, the mainstay if they wintered on Mel, ville Island., Captain Bernard said that if ice con, ditions were normal this summer, the, party organized by Stefansson which, raised the British flag on Wrangell, Island, might be rescued. He said, that experienced Arctic men could, easily live the year round on the isl, and, having polar bear as the chief, article of diet, and that there was no, reason to be pessimistic about the, fate of the party., ANCIENT BEAUTIES WOULD, NOT EQUAL MODERN GIRLS, CHICAGO, Peb. 15.—Sappho had a<, wrinkled neck and Cleopatra a flat, nose.

Marshall Dudney head, ed a search party which met Prest, coming in, and at a point 45 miles, out from Eagle. At that time Prest,, hungry and tired from his exper, iences, declared that he would never, try to salvage the airboat, but since, he has rested up and forgotten that, experience it is only natural that he, has reconsidered that decision. Brest, is for the commercial branch of fly, ing, being a practical young man,, and he has the idea that he can, make a few dollars by maintaining an, airship route through this country. |, with Fairbanks as the jumping off, place., So it may be expected that he will, make the flight here next Fourth of, July., Also in Fairbanks is Prof. Eilson, of the Fairbanks High Schools, who, is a commercial aviator of note. Back, in the middle west in his own home, camp he organized a company of, local friends and they bought two, airships during their time and the, sealed right, Kept Right, C79_, commercial earnings through Prof., Eielson’s flying not only paid for, both machines but left a profit and, one of the machines behind it., Prof. Eielson can see a future for, commerecial flying from Fairbanks, and when his school work is over, for the season may endeavor to, form a local company, or one in, cluding friends of his who have, been in such ventures with him, and, establish an air-service between Fair, banks and the coast towns, McKin, ley National Park, Dawson or the, Kantishna—wherever men need to, go in a hurry or wish to get to a, point where they will pay well to, get there. There is no reason why, such a company could not be formed, here., This ought to be a good year for, flying machines in the Fairbanks, district, if there are machines here, to do the flying. There will be tour, ist travel in plenty this year—and, 25,000 tourists visited Alaska last, year where 30,000 or more will visit, it this year.

Rev. J. E. C. Weldon,, (In this article the Bishop of Dur, ham, one of the most fearless and, outspoken clergymen of today, dis, cusses the theme of Upton Sinclair’s, novel, "They Call Me Carpenter.”, LONDON, Feb. 15.—The question:, What would Jesus Christ do if He, came on earth today, of if He came, to some particular city, as London, or Chicago, has been in late years, not infrequently discussed. It af, fords critics an easy opportunity of, attacking the supposed views or, failings of Christian people., I have thought sometimes that, nowhere on earth would Jesus Christ, feel so much at home today as in a, hospital. There is much that would, pain Him In business and society;, much, too, I am afraid, that would, pain Him in the life of the churches., But the hospitals have been, and still, are, the glories of Christendom. In, them Jesus Christ would recognize, His own spirit of Charity., Yet at the thought that the hos, pitals, or some of them, are now, closing their wards for lack of, funds, Jesus Christ would, I think,, flash out in fiery indignation against, the abuse of riches. For great as, has been the change in the distri, bution of riches luring and since, the war, there are still many rich, persons who spend upon pleasures,, and sometimes upon harmful pleas, ures, money which might well be, given to the support of hospitals., Warned of Riches, No words of Jesus Christ are more, strongly calculated to make pro, fessing Christians feel uncomfortable, than those in which He insisted, upon the peril of riches. So now, He would unsparingly condemn all, ill-gotten and ill-applied riches, lie, would unsparingly condemn all ill, applied riches. He would look, not, to riches alone, hut. to the sources, of riches as well. He would show, pity, perhaps, to some persons whom, the world censures, such as the un, happy victims of drink and lust., But Tfs would rebuke the men and, women all the more if they are, called Christian men and women, v ho, are content to enrich themselves at, the cost of bringing misery upon, them fellow citizens., J sus Christ, if He came upon, earth, would he the friend of the, poor. He was a working man Him, self. His associates and apostles, were working men. It is the strang, est of strange paradoxes that Chris, tianity should cease to be the re, ligion of the poor and become the, religion of the rich., Poor Loved Him, “The common people,” it is said,, “heard Him gladly;” and they hear, Him gladly now, when the voice, which appeals to them is His and, not that of a Christian denomination, or a Christian, in so far as he is true, if, to Christ, must always take his stand, with the poor, if only because all, souls are equal in the sight of God,, and the poor are a majority of souls., Yet I feel sure that Jesus Christ, would never speak as though poverty,, hard as it is, were due altogether, to the faults of the rich. If the, poor would be temperate and provi, dent, if they would act upon the rules, of common sense, half the evils, which afflict them would be done, away with., Jesus Christ, in fact, would lay, His finger, as he always laid it,, upon the soul. It is the soul which, matters. If the soul is right with, God, then all will be right with the, man., I always have appreciated warm, ly the words of an operative who,, at a meeting in Lancashire, said:, “I hear you talk of education; you, say. Educate! Educate! Educate. But, what I say is. Regenerate! Regener, ate! Regenerate!” It is here that the, church may find her opportunity., Church Should Uplift, She ought to be a light shining in j, the world; she ought to be the friend, of all noble, philanthropic causes;, and she ought always to lift the, minds and hearts of men and women, above the low-lying mists of earth, to the serene and sacred atmosphere, of Heaven., He prayed that it might breathe, the spirit of Heaven, and lo! it is, sometimes worldly as the world it, self. He prayed, tpo, that it might, be one, and it is rent by schisms, and heresies., Second Coming Due, The time has come for a return j, to\' Christ Himself. There are differ- j, enoes between Protestants and Rom- j, an Catholics, and it is possible either !, side may be right or may be wrong j, about them. There are differences, !, too, between the Church of England I, and the non-Episeopalian churches. I, and here again it is possible that J, either side may be right or may be J, wrong. But there is no possibility of j, difference about, the duty of the |, conciliation and co-operation among, Christian; for it is Jesus Christ, Himself who said: “By this shall all, men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.”, Patronize home industry., TENEMENT BOARDER, CLASSED AS AN EVIL, BOSTON, Feb. 15.—The keeping, of boarders should be subject to, license or permit; it is so much, a menace to family life that a law, restricting the pratice might be ad, visable, in the opinion of Professor, George La Piana, of Harvard Uni, versity. In the light of his obser, vations in the crowded tenements, of the North End district of the city,, he said in an address to workers, of the Family Wellfare Society, the, boarder in certain types of homes, must be regarded as an influence, for evil., In such cases, under conditions of, license or restriction Dr. La Piana, said boarders would be compelled, to leave houses in which their pres, ence constituted a moral or hygienic, danger. The small amount of money, lost each week by the family as a, result could well be made up by the, Welfare Society, he added., “The greater number of families, who keep boarders do not do it as, a business,” he said, “but merely to, help toward paying the rent. The, homes are very small, having three, or four rooms, one set aside for, boarders. As many boarders are, kept as beds can be squeezed into, that room. The kitchen is usually, living room, dining room and kitchen, combined, shared by family and, boarders alike. The boarders, when, they are not working, sit in the, kitchen playing cards, while the chil, dren play and the women work, around them.”, “He’s an excellent driver.”, “Auto, golf, or charity fund?”, “Don\'t you think she should have, her voice cultivated?”, “Yes, plowed under.” 1, LEGAL ADVERTISEMENTS, IN THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE, TERRITORY OF ABASKA, THIRD, DIVISION, In the Matter of Frank A.

Since then numerous, letters have been received from en, thusiasts in different sections of the, country. Many, owing to the great, distance, are doubtful of their own, achievement and of the transmitting, power of the Fairbanks station, and, forward words of praise to the broad, casting management there, fn every, instance the letters have been, checked against this station’s records,, and it has invariably been establised, that Fairbanks was received., Excerpts from a few of the letters, follow:, “Last evening, December 4, be, tween 9:30 and 10:00 p. m. (Philadel, phia time), we heard an announce, ment on our radio that we were re, ceiving a message from station!, WLAY, broadcast by the Northern!, Commercial Company of Alaska at j, Fairbanks, Alaska. The distance be-j, tween these points, Fairbanks, Alaska,,, and Philadelphia being so great wej, are naturally interested to know if we!, had really received your message di, rect; you surely have a wonderful, broadcasting station, and we congratu-;, late ourselves upon having a very, good receiving set. As the message, was cut into by several broadcasting, stations within a radius of 250 miles, of Philadelphia, this was all the mes, sage we received.”—J. C. Schmid, Phil-;, adelphia, Pa., “Tuesday evening. January 2, 1923.!, I received the call letters WLA-? I, could not make out what the last let- j, ter was. After giving the letters the I, announcer would say ‘The Call of the:, North.’ The music which I heard was I, orchestra selections. I was told that, a party in Providence, R. I., had re-|, eeived signals from Alaska, so I, thought by chance I might have, picked them up. My set is a short, wave regenerative set with two steps, of amplification and a Magnavox. The, music came through very good. Think, ing that if I did pick up the signals, from your station, you would like to, know how well your station is doing,, I am writing to you. I will also be, very glad to know if I am really able, to receive from such a distance.”—, Alton Lake, East Providence, R.

Colors that in pre, war days would have been regarded, as extremely daring are now scarce, ly noticed by the clothes connois, seurs as they paw through stocks, of materials i nsearch of something, really fit for a gentleman to wear., Khaki’s Reaction, According to one London shirt, maker, this tendency is a “throw, back” from the days when men were, bored to death with the eternal drab, khaki of the army uniform The only, surprising feature is that the craving, for brilliant colors has continued so, long after the war and that it does, not show any apparent signs of dying, out., One of the most noticeable things, about the shirts being displayed by, London’s most fashionable makers, is their stripes. Blazing paths of, color, a half-inch or more in width,, traverse the cloth that is being dis, played to those who want their, shirts “tailor made.” In the ready, made shops there is the same ab, sence of modesty and piquancy of, tone displayed in shirt offerings., Cold print cannot do justice to the, gay colorings displayed., Suits “Loud,” Too, In the matter of suits the materials, exhibited are fitting mates for the, shirts. Novelty patterns predomin, ate in the stocks of the leading, London tailors, and the conservation, •loth is displayed only when some, old-fashioned customer insists on, being shown the same thing he al, ways has been used to seeing., “Only novelty patterns are selling,”, one woolen merchant declared. “The, bread-and-cheese stuff is a glut on, the market.”, While the men are blossoming, forth in gorgeous spring raiment the, gentler sex will follow the same, tendencies, according to indications, seen in early spring displays. The, new fashions will have plenty of, color, with red, green, purple and, bright blue the predominating tints., The models will be straight and the, I, skirts a little shorter than was the, predominant tendency in the styles, of six months ago., WANTS COMPREHENSIVE, MARKETING PROGRAM, DALLAS, Tex., Feb. 15.—Mobiliza, tion of agricultural leadership be, hind “an intelligent, constructive and, comprehensive co-operative market, ing program,” is the hope of the, American Farm Bureau Federation,, said Walton Peteet, newly selected, head of the co-operative marketing, department of this body in an, nouncing his policy here today., Mr. Peteet assumed his new duties, February 1, giving up his post as, secretary of the Texas Farm Bureau, Federation. His department which, will be built of trained experts in, co-operative marketing, he said, will, stimulate and encourage the orderly, marketing of farm, ranch, orchard, and truck products of American far, mers., This work, Mr. Peteet said, will, be promoted through educational cam, paigns, addresses and conferences., The department not only will be, ready to stimulate and unify co-op, erative marketing organizations, but, also co-ordinate the efforts of these, organizations of which there are, more than 18,000 now in operation, handling a billion and a half dol, lars worth of farm products annual, ly, he announced., “You look dejected.", “Yes, married life gets on my, nerves.”, “Been married long?”, “No, the marriage takes place to, morrow.”, Patronize home merchants., IDEAL CONDITIONS IN, ALASKA \' ENVY OF, THOSE LIVING OUTSIDE, Gee!

That’s why at times we, are able to believe that it is better, as it is., Outside they moan and holler about, the high prices of coal and ice. Here, we have more coal than we can ever, use, and at as low as $3.50 a ton, and, ice! You find a ton of it on your, doorstep every morning, and you did, not order it, and it hasn’t cost you, a cent—until you have to pay to have, it moved away from there.

Whereat Hastings arose, en masse to make denial., Thomas Patriarch, 24, Montana’s, oldest cat, was a mere infant com, pared -witlvHastings’ Yellow Tom., Yellow Tom is old enough to be the, father—possibly the granddad—of the, Montana Patriarch. Yellow Tom was, lapping milk four years before Thomas, Patriarch poked his nose from the, maternal couch., The Yellow fellow is at least 28.

Fuller is authority for the, report that Yellow Tom was four, years old or more before making his, debut here., When Fuller sold his cafe and re, tired as a restauranteur. Yellow Tom, refused to move his quarters. He, stuck to the garbage can he had de, fended against all comers for more, than a quarter of a century, and is, still right on the job., Although shy one eye and the points, of both ears, Yellow Tom is still vig, orous and the terror of all stray dogs, and feline males who would invade his, garbage can domain., The old fellow is said never to, have flaunted the white flag either, to cat or dog.
