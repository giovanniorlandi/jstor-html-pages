As a rule, children have far less to say in the family \nthan their parents. Therefore, it is the parents who set the agenda and decide how things \nare done at home and in relation to the child. Most often, it is also the parents who have a \nproblem when the child is not thriving. The child thus acts as the thermometer of the \nfamily. When children are not feeling well or are sick, the parents are not doing well either.  \nMost problems arising from dysfunctional patterns are almost impossible for the \nparents to solve on their own, but with help and support from the holistically oriented \nphysician, we believe that many problems can be discovered and solved. Not only can \nhealth problems be addressed, but also problems of poor thriving in the family in \ngeneral. With the physician in the role of a coach, the family can be provided with \nrelevant exercises that will change the patterns of dysfunction. Consciousness-based \nmedicine also seems to be efficient with children and adolescents, who are much more \nsensitive to the psychosocial dimensions than adults.  \nFive needs seem to be essential for the thriving and health of the child: attention, \nrespect, love, acceptance (touch), and acknowledgment. The physician should be able to \nsee if the child lacks fulfillment in one or more of these needs, and he can then \ndemonstrate to the parents how these needs should be handled. This should be followed \nby simple instructions and exercises for the parents in the spirit of coaching. This \napproach is especially relevant when the child is chronically ill. \nKEYWORDS: quality of life, QOL, philosophy, human development, holistic medicine, public \nhealth, holistic health, holistic process theory, life mission theory, group therapy, Denmark \nDOMAINS: child health and human development, medical care, behavioral psychology, clinical \npsychology, psychiatry, nursing \n \n*Corresponding author. \n©2004 with author.  \n \n581\n', 'Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (9) TheScientificWorldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 581–588\n \nINTRODUCTION \nSometimes you will hear the following sentence: “If your child is impossible for you, you are also \nimpossible for your child.” A number of recent studies have shown that around one in four children in \nDenmark have social, psychological, or health problems[1,2,3]. Some of these studies were conducted by \nProfessor Per Schultz Jørgensen, from the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies, who also chaired \nthe Danish National Council for Children (Children Ombudsman) during 1998–2001 and these studies \nmake sad and dismal reading. We find it even more upsetting that the number of children and families in \ndistress does not appear to be changing, despite the fact that increasing attention has been given to the \nproblem.  \nWhen children are not feeling well psychosocially, it can be manifested by a range of symptoms such \nas frequent bedwetting, stomachache, sleep problems, disruption at school, bullying, problems with \nlearning, or concentration. The parents may also find their children to be completely impossible, \nnonreceptive to common sense or any reasonable attempt at upbringing. The physician will often find it \nimpossible to treat these symptoms with biomedicine. We generally do not like giving children drugs that \nsuppress symptoms because of the long-term consequences. Our holistic approach to children is not, in \nprincipal, different from our holistic approach to adult patients except that psychosocial factors seem to be \nof even more importance with children. Let us therefore first take a short review of our work relevant for \nholistic medicine in general.  \nTHE FOUNDATION OF CLINICAL HOLISTIC MEDICINE  \nThe life mission theory[4,5,6,7,8,9] states that everybody has a purpose of life or a huge talent. Happiness \ncomes from living this purpose and succeeding in expressing the core talent in your life. To do this, it is \nimportant to develop as a person into what is known as the natural condition, a condition where you know \nyourself and use all your efforts to achieve what is most important for you. The holistic process theory of \nhealing[10,11,12,13] and the related quality of life theories[14,15,16] state that the return to the natural \nstate of being is possible whenever the person gets the resources needed for existential healing. The \nresources needed are “holding” in the dimensions awareness, respect, care, acknowledgment, and \nacceptance with support and processing in the dimensions feeling, understanding, and letting go of \nnegative attitudes and beliefs. The preconditions for holistic healing to take place are trust and the \nintention of the healing to take place. Existential healing is not a local healing of any tissue, but a healing \nof the wholeness of the person, making him much more resourceful, loving, and knowledgeable of \nhimself, his own needs and wishes. In letting go of negative attitudes and beliefs, the person returns to a \nmore responsible existential position and an improved quality of life. The philosophical change in the \nperson healing is often a change towards preferring difficult problems and challenges instead of avoiding \ndifficulties in life[17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. The person who becomes happier and more resourceful often \nalso becomes more healthy, more talented, and more able to function[25,26,27].  \nTHE CHILD AS THE THERMOMETER OF THE FAMILY \nIt is of great advantage to be able to adopt a holistic perspective in relation to the child. If it is possible to \nassess and observe the whole family and not just the child, it is often possible to understand the \ninteraction and where the problem arises. As a rule, children have far less say in the family than their \nparents with the parents setting the agenda and deciding how things are done at home and in relation to \nthe child. It is also, therefore, most often the parents who have a problem when the children are \nimpossible. You can say that the children function as the thermometer of the family. When children are ill \nor not doing well, this is often due to the parents not doing well either or unable to cope with themselves, \nwith each other, and with the children. \n 582\n', 'Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (9) TheScientificWorldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 581–588\n \nCHILDREN COOPERATE \nIt is a natural reaction to blame impossible children for their impossibility. But, as the family therapist \nJesper Juul, the founder of the Scandinavian Kempler Institute in Denmark, has so outstandingly \nexplained in his book Your Competent Child[28], children like to cooperate and they will do whatever \nthey can to be loved by their parents. But children have their needs, which they are compelled to fight for \nin order to have fulfilled, even if this cuts across their parents. The following things in particular are \nconcerned:  \n• The need for attention: being seen and understood \n• The need for respect: being met and acknowledged as an independent living being \n• The need for love: care, loving touch, and loving words. \n• The need for touch and acceptance \n• The need for acknowledgment: the parents must see and fully acknowledge the character of body, \nmind, and spirit  \nInstead, children are often given the brush-off, met with emotional coldness, or perhaps even punished \nwith studied indifference or in some other way by their frustrated parents. When parents and children get \non well together, the child is the source of the greatest joy in the world. Many modern parents appreciate \ntheir children, are very attentive to their children, and are very aware of the relationship, but they \nnevertheless often overlook a number of serious imbalances. The child may be suffocated by too much \ncare and protection or may become domineering, even a complete prima donna, from receiving too much \nattention or attention of a neurotic and idolizing nature. The child might even become domineering and \ntake up too much space from misunderstood respect of boundaries and independence. It is more usual, \nhowever, for the children to be neglected, ignored, insulted, scolded, and condemned.  \nIt is not easy to be a child, but it is just as true to say that it is not easy to be a parent. A good holistic \ncure for the child, therefore, is support for the parents in being good parents with an understanding of the \nneeds of their children. The project is not concerned with the child, but with the parents and how they \ndeal with the child. As they are the adults, they must also take responsibility and stop being impossible \nfor the child, because when they do, the child will start to do well and if he or she is sick, to get better. \nAnd soon the child will flourish and be a joy to the parents, which they had never thought to be possible.  \nMale, age 1 year, and neglect: 12-month well-baby examination in the family practice \nwith vaccination. Seems a little neglected. The mother also has another young child in her \ncare, who is a late developer and to whom she often gives priority. There is clear jealousy \nand demand for attention, which triggers scolding. Ears: nothing abnormal discovered. \nTalk about it. Recommended reading: Jesper Juul, Your Competent Child[28]. \nIt is upsetting that so many small children are “maltreated” in Denmark. Physical violence is \nprohibited, but neglect and other forms of abuse are “permitted”. At the well-baby visits, it also seems \nthat quite a number of mothers do not even know what they are doing when they scold a 1-year-old child. \nCriticism is experienced by the child as if the “King” himself told him and can be experienced as blows, \njust as bad as if they had been physical blows; indeed, perhaps worse. In our clinical life, we try to use \nany opportunity to teach parents about the need for care, attention, and respect for children. But parents, \nwho themselves have “been failed” in their childhood, must face up to their failures and old wounds in \norder to be able to act better towards their own children. This is very painful and we proceed very slowly \nwith them. A good book, which they can take at their own pace to read, is a good idea.  \nMale, aged 3 years, and agitated: 3-year development examination in the family \npractice. Good development, he has very good motor skills, but his language skills are \nless well developed, he is unable or unwilling to repeat syllables. Not so cooperative in \n 583\n', 'Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (9) TheScientificWorldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 581–588\n \nthe vision test, which will have to be carried out in a later examination. Some problems in \nday care, where the teacher finds him too agitated. Here he tears up the paper on the \ncouch. Perhaps he needs to be met at his boundary [i.e., in balanced contact with his \nmother, when she crosses the boundary her son has dominated] more than the mother is \ndoing at present. We talk briefly about this.  \nA 3-year-old boy who acts in protest would seem to have been browbeaten rather than met. He “fights \nfor his life” everywhere, including when he is brought to see the family physician. There is no reason to \nbe angry with him. On the contrary, it is fine that he fights. As a holistic physician, one has “a bone to \npick” with the mother, to whom the problem and its possible causes must be discreetly turned over. If she \nmakes changes and meets him at his boundary, their life together will be completely transformed, into fun \nand games instead of war and argument, from pain to joy for them both in the years to come. Think what \na difference such a small change from battling with the boy to showing him respect will make!  \nFemale, aged 5 years, with problems concerning respect: 5-year examination – \ndevelopment good, but there are probably some problems with being respected. Has a \ngreat need to take care of herself. Does not want to be vaccinated, and I do not wish to \nenforce it. Is to come back in 3 months for diphtheria-tetanus vaccination. Social: Today \nappears shy and inhibited. It appears as though the father violates the patient’s \nboundaries. Says in as many words that he has to put her in her place the whole time. He \nregards her as impossible and has some problems in bringing her up. He gets on better \nwith his son. Discussion on children’s needs: care, attention, and respect. I am not sure \nthat he understood. They are to come back in 3 months for a further attempt at \nvaccination. This is a good opportunity to return to the subject. \nIn this case, the needs of the girl were discussed with the father who seemed to have difficulties \nproviding care and respect because of lack of knowledge. Our function as physician is not to become \nemotional and condemnatory, but to remain neutral and helpful. The lack of self-respect in the father, \nwhich deep down is what it is about, is a widespread condition and the father needs our respect, not our \ndisrespect. If we are to break the social heritage, we need to make him understand what is going on. If he \ndoes understand, a long and difficult process will be started in him where he gradually takes responsibility \nfor all the pain there is in him from long ago in his own childhood, which having a young child constantly \nreminds him of. The alternative is for him to continue to take out his frustration on his child, become \nangry with her and irritated by her instead of taking responsibility for the pain in himself. The child is \nblamed for the discomfort he feels (that is, the discomfort he felt when he himself was a child). \nFemale, aged 3 years, and afraid of animals (arachnophobia): Increasingly afraid of \nsmall animals over the course of a year – she now screams and becomes completely \nhysterical as soon as she sees a small animal – she says herself that she is most afraid of \nspiders. Father and mother immediately kill all the small animals they can find and \nequipped the girl with a fly-swatter so that she can defend herself. The father, who comes \nwith his daughter, also says that he really cannot stand seeing the patient become so \nfrightened. I ask the father whether it is OK for his daughter to become afraid and we are \nin agreement that it is. She is allowed to have the feelings she has. So he must just hold \nonto her and support her as well as he can in the meantime. I capture a small animal \noutside and show it to the patient, while the father holds onto her, and she is not afraid. It \nappears as though the pattern has been broken. They are to come back if the problem \npersists. \nTo us, it is great medical art, although it is extremely simple: The girl did not receive support from \nher father when she was afraid. On the contrary, he reacted inappropriately (in a neurotic manner) and in \n 584\n', 'Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (9) TheScientificWorldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 581–588\n \nso doing reinforced the girl’s anxiety. From our point of view, not only did he reinforce her anxiety, but it \nis actually the disturbance in him that has made the girl afraid of animals in the first place. So in reality, it \nis the father we are treating here under the disguise of attending to the girl. A more difficult, but in the \nlonger term more effective, strategy would be to make the father understand that he is himself disturbed \nand over-protective. \nMale, aged 10 years, with pain in the foot due to a “I hide myself” posture: Walks on \nthe inside of the foot and is in pain after sport – judo and badminton. As a result of a \nstooping, “I hide myself” posture, the pelvis is tilted and the knees are turned inward, \nproducing functional flat-footedness. On examination: when the knees are bent out over \nthe foot, the flat-footedness is straightened out and the arch is lifted off the floor. The \nmetatarsal arch is flattened. Conclusion: There is no major anatomical defect, the \nproblem is functional. The patient is instructed to lift his knee up over the side of the midfoot\nand to “walk like a cowboy”. Social: Patient appears to be affected by having \nmoved, at his own request, from his mother to his father and stepmother, with whom he \nhas a very good relationship (she comes along with him). However, he still sees his \nmother every other weekend. He is to come back in a month, when we will see whether \nthere has been any improvement following the exercises. \nSocial and family-related problems hit children and adolescents hard. The defense mechanism is often \nsome negative attitudes in life, which are directly reflected in the way the body is used. Often incorrect \nuse of the body leads, in turn, to problems with the locomotor system as in the case described above. A \nproblem of this kind is difficult to solve with insoles in the shoes, but when the problem is seen in context \nand thoroughly understood, it is not difficult to do something about it.  \nFemale, 39 years, setting boundaries for oneself, not for one’s child: 1. Inflammation \nparticularly in left Achilles tendon. On examination: slight reddening around the skin, \nresembles streptococcal infection. Prescribe Fucidin cream tid, washing occasionally with \nsoapy water. 2. The problem with regard to setting boundaries in relation to her \ndomineering daughter has improved greatly now that the mother sets boundaries for \nherself. \nThe patient presents with a minor physical complaint and we talk about how she can become a better \nmother for her daughter by setting boundaries for herself (staying in her own area) instead of setting \nboundaries for her daughter, stamping on her, and trying to solve the problems by subjugating her. Either \nthe daughter can be supported in applying her intelligence and her desire to cooperate or an attempt can \nbe made to condition her — in the same way that Pavlov trained his dogs. The former leads to lively, \nhappy, and healthy children, while the latter results in neurotic children and later in neurotic adults. \nDISCUSSION \nMany parents do not understand the ill health of their child as they often have difficulties seeing the \nchild’s unfulfilled needs and the dysfunctional patterns in the family. The idea that psychosocial \ndynamics are a cofactor in the etiology is often strongly provoking, so the perspective must be presented \nwisely and cautiously to avoid psychological resistance with a poor outcome of holistic therapy.  \nMany parents hope that the disease of their child will be cured by a simple pharmacological \ntreatment. When the child remains sick, parents will eventually, if guided by a physician proficient in \nusing holistic tools[29], gradually open up to a psychosocial perspective, where the physician can support \nthe development of the quality of life of the child and the quality of life in the whole family. Another \nproblem often seen more and more in the clinic is the holistically oriented parent who does not want to \n 585\n', 'Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (9) TheScientificWorldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 581–588\n \ngive the children the prescribed drugs. In this case, holistic medicine is an obvious choice, if appropriate \nin the situation. Sometimes a biomedical treatment is also needed, as in the case where antibiotics are the \nright choice to cure the child and the role of the physician will be to teach the parents the use and \nlimitations of the different medical paradigms[30], a job that in the end might even save the life of the \nchild.  \nCONCLUSION \nMany problems noticed in the clinic are almost impossible for the parents to solve on their own, but with \na little help from the holistically oriented physician, who understands that the child is the thermometer of \nthe family functioning, many problems can be solved. Not only health problems, but also problems of \npoor thriving in the family, can be addressed. When the physician takes on a role of coach and provides \nthe family with small relevant exercises, even larger patterns of dysfunction can be turned. \nConsciousness-based medicine seems to be extremely efficient with children and adolescents, who are \nmuch more sensitive to the psychosocial dimensions than adults. Five needs seems to be essential for the \nthriving and health of the child: attention, respect, love, touch, and acknowledgment[28].  \nThe physician should be able to see if the child lacks fulfillment in one or more of these needs and he \ncan then demonstrate to the parents how these needs should be met. This should be followed by simple \ninstructions and exercises for the parents in the spirit of coaching. This approach is especially relevant \nwhen the child is chronically ill. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis study was supported by grants from IMK Almene Fond.
