Col. Kaster\nlitzky of the Mexican army.\nThis daring fighter is nor a\nMexican, but, as his name implies,\na native of Poland. Coming to\nthe United States at 15 years of\nage, he gained a good knowledge\nof English and drifted into Mex\nico. There he joined the Mexican\nregular army, and now, at 45\nyears of age, is known as one of\nthe most intrepid .soldiers the re\npublic has.\n\' It has been claimed that Kaster\nlitzky was trained in the United\nStates army, but officers of the\nDepartment of the Colorado say\nthat he was never in the army.\nHis love of personal liberty and\nhis instincts as a soldier of fortune\nwere developed here.\nCol. Kasterlitzky is a tall, wiry,\nstrongly knit man, trained in all\nthe arts of his calling and one of\nthe best shots in the Mexican\narmy. He \' is probably the best\nman in that\' country to cope with.a\nmob.\nOn a trip to Mexico some years\nago the editor of the Reveille had\nthe pleasure of meeting and ge\'tting\nwell acquainted with Col. Emelio\nKasterlitzky, and also of hearing\nmany interesting stories related of\nhim.\nThe Colonel, who is a Pole of\nnoble blood, came to the United\nStates at an early age and enlisted\nin the regular army. While sta\ntioned at El Paso, so the story goes,\nhe struck an officers of thearmv for\na fancied insult. Knowing the\nsevere punishment which would be\nvisited on him, he fled across the\nRio Grande into Mexico. He found\nit impossible to get a commission\nin the Mexican army, and as the\nprivates in that country are recruit\ned from the criminal classes he\ncould hardly enlist.\nKnowing all about horses, he\nwas finally attached to the army.in\nthe capacity of a horseshoer. When\non a campaign in Sinoa his Com\npany was attacked by a band of\nYaqui Indians. The commanding\nofficer of the Mexicans ordered a\nmasterl retreat. The horseshoer\nwas mounted on a mule, which,\nwith true obstinacy, refused to re\ntreat, but broke into a gallop,\nBeaded toward the enemy. Kas\nterlitzky could not check his steed,\nso he drew a pistol and shouted for\nthe Mexican soldiers to follow\nhim. They did so, and the enemy\nwas put to flight. For this act of\ninvoluntary valor, Kasterlitzky\nwas made an officer, and has\nsteadily advanced until he is now\na colonel.\nOnce at Magdalena, in the state\nof Sonora, where the Colonel was\nin command of the barracks, he\nentertained an American friend.\nThe next morning, while dressing,\nthe visitor heard some gunshots.\nWhen he met his hos: at breakfast\nhe asked the cause of the firing,\nand the Colonel told him he had\njust had three soldiers shot. He\nwas asked what they were charged\nwith and replied: "Nothing in\nparticular. We just shot them to\nkeep up discipline."\nTHE ARMY- POSTS.\nSeven Brigade Posts Are to Be Estab\nlishedPresident and Taft So\nDecide.\nA dispatch from Oyster Bay\nsay:\nImportant steps\' calculated, to\nmaterially develop the efficiency of\nthe army were taken today by\nPresident Roosevelt and Secretary\nTaft at Sagamore Hill. In his last\nannual message to Congress the\nPresident said the number of posts\nin which the army is kept in time\nof peace should be materially di\nminished and the posts that are\nleft made correspondingly larger.\nThis recommendation is to be\ncarried out at once. Seven brigade\nposts to be commanded by Bri\ngadier Generals are to be establish\ned. Two others are desired, but\nthe funds at the disposal of the\nSecretary may not be sufficient to\nallow of their equipment during\nthe present fiscal year. The posts\nwhich the President and Secretary\ntentatively decided today to en\nlarge to brigade posts are those at\nFort Robinson, Neb.; Fort Riley,.\nFort Leavenworth, Kan.; Fort Sam\nHouston, Texas; Fort D. A. Rus\nsell, Wis.; Fort Sill, Ok., and Fort\nOglethorpe, Ga. It is desired to\nhave one in Pennsylvania and one\non the Pacific Coast, but these will\nhave to be taken care of later.\nFinal action regarding these posts\nwill be taken a week from next\nMonday, when Secretary Taft will\nmake a second visit to Oyster Bay.\nThe army appropriation act\ncarries SS00, 000 for the creation of\narray posts. It also carries $3,\n000,000 for barracks and quarters\nand $12,000,000 for the transporta\ntion of the army. Before this mon\ney can be expended a complete\nplan as to what it shall be used for\nmust be made and the lump sum\nappropriations so apportioned that\nno deficiency wil?be created. In\nattempting to carry out his plan,\nthe President is simply following\nthe line he indicated to Congress\nin his message. It is his firm belief\nthat the army should be trained\nabove all else to act in a mass. To\nthis end he suggested that provision\nbe made for maneuvers of a prac\ntical kind. In his plan he says\nthat the Generals and Colonels\nwould have opportunity to handle\nregiments, brigades and divisions\nand the commissary and medical\ndepartments would be tested in the\nfield.\nThe President, following this\nwith comment on the weeding out\nprocess which the West Point\nMilitary Academy does \' on pros\npective army officers, says there\nshould be some process in the army\nthat would achieve the same end.\n"After a certain age has been\nreached," he says, the average\nofficer is unfit to do good work\nbelow a certain grade\' \'\nProvision, he maintains, should\nbe made for the promotion of ex-\nceptionaliy meritorious men over\nthe head\'s of their comrades, and\nfor the retirement of all men who\nhave reached a given age without\ngoing beyond a given rank.\nThe locations selected for the\nposts are all places where the Gov\nernment has large reservations and\nwhere troops may be mobilized to\nadvantage for maneuvers or other\npurposes. At Oglethorpe, Ga., the\npost is adjacent to the Chickamauga\nNational Park.\nSecretary Taft spent but two\nhours with the President today.\nHe arrived from Washington at\n10:15 this morning and left on the\nnoon train. This was Secretary\nTaft\'s first visit to Oyster Bay\nBesides going over the army post\nmatter, the Secretary discussed the\nspeech he is to deliver to the Re\npublican State convention of North\nCarolina at Greensboro Monday\nni ht. The Secretary has one more\nspeaking engagement in an address\nbefore the Ohio Bar Association at\nPut-In Bay, after which he is to\ntake a two months\' rest at Murray\nBay, eighty miles below Quebec,\non the St. Lawrence River.\nThe Secretary will accompany\nthe President to Panama, and said\nthe start for the Isthmus would be\nmade immediately after the No\nvember elections, that the Pres\nident micht be in Washington be\nfore the opening: of Congress.\nSusbcribe ta The Hek.aI.ij.\nSUITS FILED.\nSanta Fe and I. & G. N. SetX to Enloin\nthe Commission H. & T. C Pas\nsenger Rate Reduction Included.\nAustin, Texas, July 11. The\nInternational and Great Northern\nand the Santa Fe railwavs have\nfiled suits in the federal court here\nagainst the tariffs of the railroad\ncommission. The Chronicle stated\nFriday that the attornevs were at\nwork on the petitions in the suits,\nwhich statement was denied, out\nof Dallas.\nThe petitions were filed last Sat\nurday evening, but were held up\nuntil the process could be served,\nwhich was yesterday evening.\nThe roads attack the entire body\nof rates established by the railroad\ncommission of Texas since Febru\nary 28, 1899, which was the date\non which the compromise of the\nsuits instituted by the railroad\ncompanies in the later part of 189S\nbecame effective. The bills of the\nGulf, Colorado and Sacta Fe and\nthe International aud Great North\nern are in their main features quite\nsimilar. Eachtorapany complains\nthat the reductions made by the\nrailroad commission since Febru\nary 2S, 1899, have resulted in the\ndiminution, to the extent of sev\neral hundred thousand dollars, of\nits revenues, and that the rates\nnow existing as a whole are so far\nfrom compensatory that they are in\nviolation of the fourteenth amend\nment to the constitution of the\nUnited States, which provides that\nno state shall deprive any person\nof property without due process of\nlaw, and that no state shall deny\nto any person within ;ts jurisdic\ntion the equal protection of the\nlaws. "Among other grounds of\ncomplaint, ltis stated that the re\nduction recently made by the com\nmission of the passenger fare of\nthe Houston anf Texas Central\ntrom o to z l-z cemsBjjvis\na natural and reasoiTJIW result\nreduces the revenue of each of the\ncompanies to the extent of several\nthousand dollars annually on pas\nsenger ousiness competitive with\nthe Houston and Texas Central.\nEach of the bills complains not\nonly of the tariff of rates establish\ned by the commission since Feb\nruary 28, 1899, but also of all\nrules, orders and circulars issued\nby the commission since that date,\nand having the effect of reducing\nrailway rates and charges. Each\nof the bills is very elaborate in its\nallegations, and sets forth the re\nsults of operation for a series of\nyears, showing in detail gross in\ncome, and deficits or surpluses for\nthe various years. Each of the\nbills complains of increases for\nseveral years in the prices of labor\nand material used by railroad com\npanies, and of other increases in\nexpenses. It is shown in each\nbill that the affairs o( the company\nhave been managed prudently and\neconomically, and that nevertheless\nthe business has been unprofitable.\nEach bill concludes with a prayer\nfor injunction restraining the rail\nroad commission and the members\nthereto, and the attorney general\nfrom enforcing existing tariffs,\ncirculars, schedules, rules, orders\nand classifications established by\nthe railroad commission since Feb\nruary 28, 1899, and from suing\nfor penalties by reason of the fail\nure of the complaining company to\nobey such tariffs, circulars, etc.,\nand restraining the commission\nand the members thereof from\nhereafter establishing any tariffs,\ncirculars, etc., reducing the rates\nbelow those established by. the\ncomprojnise of February 28, 1899.\nIt is claimed by each company\nthat the rates established by the\ncompromise of February 28, 1899,\nare not themselves sufficiently re\nmunerative, but that, the compa\nnies are willing to abide by the\nsame as the result of the settle\nment which brought about their\nestablishment.\nNo preliminary injunction it\nsought, but the injunction, if one\nis granted, will be issued when the\nsuits are tried.\nif', 'The Brownsville Herald.\nJesse O.

" With artesian\nwater here the question of water\nworks would be comparatively an\neasy matter, and investigation will\nat least do no harm.\nA Matamoros Girl.\nThe following is from the last\nissue of Texas Farm and Ranch,\nand was written by Mrs. S. B.\nBuchanan, who conducts the\nCousin\'s Leatrue in that paper, and\nwho visited Brownsville and Mata\nmoros during the recent visit of\nthe Texas Press association here:\n\' \'I have just returned from a very\npleasant and quite ai extensive\ntrip, and saw many interesting\nsights. At Matamoros, Mexico, I\nmet a young Spanish girl, just\nsixteen years old, who impressed\nme as quite a prodigy in music,\nand of her I wish to tell you.\nIn company with Mrs. Hudson\nof Brownsville, I called upon Seno-\nnta Maria Fernandez Moranti.\nShe is a very quiet, retiring young\ngirl of pure Castilian blood, being!\na pronounced blonde. Her mother\nis a very beautiful woman, quite\nyouthful in appearance, with lovely\nblue eyes, fair complexion and\nbronzy curling hair: Neither of\nthem spoke English and neither of\nus spoke Spanish, so we had to\npantomime\' for a few momemts,\nuntil her cousin, a handsome young\nSpaniard, wh6 spoke tolerable\nEnglish, came to the res\'cue and\ninterpreted for us.\nSefiorita Morauti has studied\nfour years under a home teacher;\nin fact, has never been away from\nher native city, Matamoros, nor\nstudied under any other teacher.\nShe played quite a number of her\nown compositions; A Romanza;\ndescriptive pieces, Holy Day,\nBuenos Noches, (Beautiful Night)\nand others whose names we cannot\nrecall, besides very beautiful ar\nrangements of several popular\noperas; playing on some pieces\nfrom the original unpublished\nnotes.\nHer compositions are unusually\nmusical, full of melody, and her\ntouch very fine.\nWhen asked if she would not go\nout into the world to win fame and\ngold, she said she had not thought\nof doing so, nor did she think she\nwould. She is quite content to\nremain at Home, study, practice\nand give pleasure to her mother,\nwho, naturally is very proud of\nher. She is exceedingly modest,\ndresses in deep .mourning for her\nfather, and when not at the piano\nis shrinking in her manner.\nShe has published quite a number\nof compositions, for which, through\nher modesty and lack of business\ntraining, she received in compensa\ntion only a few copies of each piece\npublished, to the shame of the\npublishers.\nMatamoros -is an old Mexicau\nborder town and gives one the\nfeeling of being a long way from\nlome with its quaint, low, stuccoed\nbuildings, narrow streets and\nthrongs of dusky skinned people,\namong them many children, the\nlittie girls, almost, every one, with\nthe rebosa wrapped about her head\nand around the shoulders. With\nthe poorest classes this is usually\na black scarf of some light woolen\ngoods one width of ordinary\ngoods about three yards long;\nand no matter how warm, you will\nsee them thus bundled up. Little\ntots four or five years old wear the\nrebosa too.\nWith the better class the black\nlace mantilla takes its place, and\nwe saw many pretty senoritas in\nlight muslin dresses, usually gay\nin color, with the lace mantilla\nshading their bright faces, prom\nenading in the plaza."\nIt is almost self-evident that the,\nman who boasts of loving his neigh\nbor as himself may have a grudge\nagainst himself.\n101 ADVISES LOTS OF.WHISKY.\nDrink and Smoke and Play, but Do Not\nThink or Worry.\nNew York. "Drink plenty of\ngood beer, wine and whisky.\n"Don\'t think too much.\n"Smoke all you want to and\nnever worry.\n"Do everything regularly and\nnever in excess.\n"Play with chiidrec one hour\na day.\nFaithful observance of these\nrules is the reason Joseph Keitlin,\nwho yesterday celebrated his 101st\nbirthday, gives for his long life.\nHe lives with a daughter at No.\n136 Lexington avenue, Brooklyn.\nIn celebration of his birthday he\nsmoked j. few extra cigarettes, but\ndid not otherwise deviate from\nhis "routine" of life.\n\' One trouble with all Americans\nis that they do - everything in\nbunches and too fast," said the\ncentenarian. "Lots of them drink\nas much as I do and it kills them.\nI take it in small quantities aud\noften. They eat too much and too\nfast, and I never did either. Mo:e\nmen are killing from overeating\nthan from not having enough to\neat. f \'\n\' \'I drink wine the first thing in\nthe morning\', drink beer with my\nmeals and whisky afternoons and\nth\'re hasn\'t been a day for seventy\nfive years that I have not had ten\nor a dozen drinks of good bever\nages. I don\'t have indigestion\nbecause I chetv my food in my\nmouth instead of in my stomach.\nI never knew what it was to\nworry. Half the men you see\nlook as if the cares of the world\nwere resting on them. If men\nwould pay with children one hour\nevery day they would live longer."\nBorn in Lodz, Russia, Mr. Zeit\nliu came to this country when IS\nyears of age. He made a com\nfortable fortune as a commission\nmerchant.\nIf You Are a Lover\nOf good bread, pies, cakes and\nrolls call at Clay\'s bakery, Sixth\nand Levee streets.

The source of his illness\nwas apparent when a live frog\njumped from his mouth and began\nto hop away. The pains imme\ndiately ceased and he seems to\nhave been left none the worse for\nthe incubation job done by his\nstomach.\nThe frog was nearly an inch\nlong and almost . entirely white\nsave for a very light brownish\ncolored stripe down the back. It\nis supposed that Hamm must have\nswallowed a very small tadpole in\na glass of drinking water some time\nago and that the animal lived and\nmatured in his stomach.
