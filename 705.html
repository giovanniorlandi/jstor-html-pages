        <pre>['DEBATE\n836       September 2016, Vol. 106, No. 9\nPsychoactive substances: Position \nstatement on harm reduction\nThe recent special session of the United Nations General Assembly on \ndrugs was timely for several reasons. It is clear that the ‘war on drugs’ has \nfailed – a singular focus on supply reduction does not work. Worldwide, \nthere have been ongoing changes in the legal status of alcohol, tobacco, \nmarijuana and other psychoactive substances or drugs, as states attempt \nto develop balanced strategies of supply reduction, demand reduction \nand harm reduction. There is increasing emphasis on the importance \nof implementing evidence-based policies to address the significant \nmorbidity and mortality associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco, \nmarijuana and other psychoactive substances.[1-4]\nPsychoactive substances are subject to several international and national \nconventions and laws that have emphasised the importance of the ‘war on \ndrugs’ and supply reduction. At the same time, it is increasingly clear that \nevidence-based, balanced policies are needed, which address the important \ndifferences between alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and other psychoactive \nsubstances or drugs.[5] The Prevention of and Treatment for Substance \nAbuse Act 70 of 2008 speaks to the National Drug Master Plan, which \nemphasises a range of strategies for addressing the excessive use of alcohol, \ntobacco, marijuana and other psychoactive substances.\nSupply reduction refers to policing efforts to curb the manufacture \nand distribution of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and other psychoactive \nsubstances or drugs. Demand reduction refers to preventive efforts \nto decrease their demand. Harm reduction refers to policies and \ninterventions to reduce the harmful consequences of alcohol, tobacco, \nmarijuana and other psychoactive substance use. Focusing on harm \nreduction does not indicate that risky behaviours in general, and the use \nof psychoactive substances or drugs in particular, are welcomed. This \napproach is based rather on the scientific evidence on what works to \nimprove public health and reduce social harms when tobacco, alcohol, \nmarijuana and other psychoactive substances are already being used.[6,7]\nNot all psychoactive substance use is harmful, although alcohol, \ntobacco, marijuana and other psychoactive substances are associated \nwith a spectrum of potential harms to individuals and to society.[5] \nExtrapolating from international knowledge, it is clear that in South \nAfrica (SA) alcohol is the most harmful substance in use, in view of its \nlinks with physical illness, mental illness, interpersonal violence and \ncrime. Tobacco is also extremely harmful to individuals and costly for \nsociety because of its link with lung cancer and other medical conditions. \nMarijuana has been associated with many harmful effects, as have \na range of other substances. Therefore, evidence-based policies and \ninterventions must address the individuals and communities involved, \nthe drugs being consumed and the environment in which this occurs.[8]\nFortunately, growing evidence shows that specific policies and \ninterventions can reduce the potential harms associated with the \ncontinued use of psychoactive substances.[6,7] For example, there is \nconsiderable evidence that brief psychotherapies are useful for treating \nsufferers from alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and other drug dependence. \nPrimary care clinicians should screen for abuse and provide evidencebased\ninterventions where indicated.[9] Other efficacious interventions \nfor reducing harm in people with alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, opioid \nand other drug use include medication-assisted treatment and needle \nand syringe programmes.[10,11] Providing such interventions requires \nthe work of many stakeholders; skills must be developed, medications \nand human resources made available, and health systems strengthened.\nRecommendations\n• The National Drug Master Plan emphasises the importance of \nan integrated approach to supply reduction, demand reduction \nand harm reduction strategies for combating alcohol, tobacco, \nmarijuana and other psychoactive substance use and abuse in SA. \nFor any substance, the balance between these three strategies and the \napproach taken should be evidence-based.\n• Data from other countries show that alcohol causes the most \nindividual and societal harm. It is therefore essential to put particular \nefforts into implementing evidence-based policies and interventions \nfor alcohol harm reduction. This should address upstream drivers of \nalcohol use, as well as prevention and intervention.\n• Efforts to reduce harm have been poorly resourced in SA and, given \nthe enormous profits of the liquor industry, there is a need and \nobligation for its greater involvement in local harm reduction efforts.\n• Local school survey data suggest high rates of experimentation \nwith alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and other drugs during early \nadolescence. Evidence-based interventions, including a strong focus \non harm reduction, are needed in this age group, which comprises a \nlarge proportion of South Africans.\n• There is little evidence that focusing on supply reduction via \ncriminalisation is effective in reducing alcohol, tobacco, marijuana \nand other substance abuse. There are insufficient data showing that \nthe commercialisation of such entities is safe, particularly when it is \nnot accompanied by rigorous supply, demand and harm reduction \nstrategies.\n• Evidence-based approaches that reduce harm from continued and \nchronic use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and other substances \n(particularly among vulnerable groups such as adolescents and \npeople with mental disorders) deserve greater attention and \nadditional resources. These include psychotherapy and medicationassisted\ntherapy for individuals, and addressing the structural drivers \nof continued psychoactive substance use.\n• Mental, neurological and substance use disorders contribute \nsignificantly to SA’s burden of disease. There must be more research \nattention and a greater focus of clinical resources on this area.\nDan J Stein\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University \nof Cape Town, South Africa\ndan.stein@uct.ac.za\nEva Manyedi\nSchool of Nursing, Faculty of Agriculture, Science and Technology, North-West \nUniversity, Mahikeng, South Africa \nFor the Executive Committee of the Central Drug Authority (Carol du Toit,  \nDan Stein, David Bayever, Eva Manyedi, Johlene Ntwana, Lethiwe Ndlovu,  \nMogotsi Kalaemodimo, Moses Gama, Pelmos Mashabela, Peter Ucko)\n1.
