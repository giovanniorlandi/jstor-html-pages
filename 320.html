        <pre>['WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  1 \n \n \nAbstract \n The inescapable reality is that most law school graduates are headed for professional life. \nThis means that law schools have some accountability for the competence of their \ngraduates, and thus an educational responsibility to offer their students instruction in the \nbasic skills of legal representation. The most obvious and direct gain from the university \nlaw school offering more training in the generally neglected applied legal skills of trial \nadvocacy, interviewing, counselling, drafting and negotiation, is the benefit to students in \nhelping them bridge the gap between traditional basic legal education and practice. \nAlthough I strongly believe that the LLB curriculum should also include courses in legal \nwriting, negotiation, client counselling, and witness interviewing, I emphasise adding a \nclinical course in trial advocacy to the LLB curriculum for a number of specific reasons. \nTrial advocacy consists of a set of skills that transcends the walls of the courtroom. It is \ndifficult to conceive of a practising lawyer who does not, in some way and at some time, \nutilise the skills of advocacy - fact analysis, legal integration and persuasive speech. Even \nthe technical "forensic skills" of trial advocacy, such as courtroom etiquette and \ndemeanour, learning how to phrase a question to elicit a favourable response, and making \nan effective oral presentation, transfer readily to a wide range of applications within both \nthe legal and business worlds. In addition to learning how to prepare and present a trial \nfrom the opening speech through to the closing argument, in a trial advocacy course \nstudents would also learn to apply procedural, substantive and ethical rules of law to prove \nor defend a cause of action. Moreover, if university law schools fail to contribute to \nestablishing a substantial body of competent trial lawyers, our failure will ultimately take \nits toll on our system of justice. The quality of courtroom advocacy directly affects the rights \nof litigants, the costs of litigation, the proper functioning of the justice system, and, \nultimately, the quality of justice. Also, traditional law school teaching in legal ethics is \nnecessarily abstract and a-contextual. It can be effective at providing instruction in the law \nof lawyering, but it is seldom as productive when it comes to examining more subtle \nquestions. The university trial advocacy course is the ideal forum in which to raise \nambiguous and textured ethical issues. Ethics problems cannot be avoided or rationalised, \nbecause the student trial lawyer must always make a personal decision. In the ethics \nclassroom, it is all too easy to say what lawyers should do. In the simulated courtroom, \nstudents have to show what they have chosen to do. I argue that a university trial advocacy \ncourse should not be antithetical to the university mission. Thus, students should be given \nthe opportunity to learn not only "how" to conduct a trial, but also "why" their newly acquired \nskills should be used in a certain way, and "what" effect the use of that skill could have. \nThrough properly constructed case files, assignments and class discussions, students \nshould be able to reflect on issues that go beyond the mere mastery of forensic skills. A \nuniversity course in trial advocacy must be infused with instruction in evidence, legal \nethics, procedure, litigation planning, the encouragement of critical thinking about the \nlitigation and trial process, and the lawyer\'s role in the adversary system. I also suggest, \nin concrete terms and by way of example, the outlines of both the theoretical and practical \ncomponents of a university trial advocacy course that would result in a highly practical \ncourse of solid academic content. \nKeywords \nTrial advocacy; legal skills; legal education; LLB curriculum. \n…………………………………………………….  \nPericles Should Learn to Fix a Leaky Pipe –  \nWhy Trial Advocacy Should Become Part  \nof the LLB Curriculum (Part 2) \nWH Gravett* \n \nPioneer in peer-reviewed,  \nopen access online law publications \nAuthor \nWillem H Gravett \nAffiliation \nUniversity of Pretoria \nSouth Africa \nEmail willem.gravett@up.ac.za \nDate of submission \n9 June 2017 \nDate published  \n23 January 2018 \nEditor Dr A Gildenhuys \nHow to cite this article   \nGravett WH "Pericles Should Learn \nto Fix a Leaky Pipe – Why Trial \nAdvocacy Should Become Part of \nthe LLB Curriculum (Part 2) \n"PER / PELJ 2018(21) - DOI \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17159/17273781/2018/v21i0a2635\nCopyright \n \nDOI \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17159/17273781/2018/v21i0a2635\n\n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  2 \n1 Introduction \nThe legal profession has increasingly questioned whether law students emerge \nfrom South African university law schools equipped with those skills needed by \nthe great majority of them who intend to practice law. Certain legal academics \nhave responded that the role of the law school is to educate law students in the \ntheories and substance of the law, and "how to think like lawyers"; it is not to \nfunction as a trade school.1 While practitioners and legal academics argue about \nwhose responsibility it is to teach practical skills, young lawyers are floundering \nand wishing somebody would help them before they damage their clients\' \ninterests or destroy their professional reputations. \nThe inescapable reality is that most law school graduates are headed for \nprofessional life. This means that law schools have some accountability for the \ncompetence of their graduates.2 I believe that university law schools have an \neducational responsibility to offer their students instruction in the basic skills of \nlegal representation. An educational experience in a protected academic setting \n- far from being tangential to or in conflict with preparation for a career in practice \n- is indeed the ideal basic preparation for a professional career in law.3 \nThe most obvious and direct gain from the university law school\'s offering more \ntraining in the generally neglected applied legal skills of trial advocacy, \ninterviewing, counselling, drafting and negotiation, is the benefit to students in \nhelping them bridge the gap between traditional basic legal education and \npractice. In fact, helping neophytes to bridge this gap is essentially an \ninstructional problem. \nThe practical is an inseparable aspect of proper cognitive learning. It is axiomatic \nin learning theory that when cognitive studies are accompanied by active \nengagement in their application to concrete problems, the likely result is more \ncomplete comprehension, better retention and more apt recall of the cognitive \nmaterial.4 \nMoreover, a critical aspect of basic professional education is learning what it truly \nmeans to bring doctrinal and theoretical knowledge, analytical methods, \ninvestigation, communication and persuasion to the actual treatment of complex \n                                            \n*  Willem H.

The law schools have performed reasonably well in preparing students \nin legal analysis, but they have not performed well at all in teaching students how \nto translate those intellectual skills into practice.7 \nIt is possible to offer an effective university trial advocacy course which, without \npretending to turn out skilled trial lawyers, can be expected to result in certain \nminimum achievements.8 Our students would graduate with greatly enhanced \nknowledge of trial advocacy, and with increased and well-founded confidence in \ntheir own abilities to act as trial lawyers. More significantly, our students would \nleave university with at least enough knowledge of effective advocacy to assess \ntheir own future performances, and to grow towards consistent competence in \nthe courtroom.9 \nProfessional courses in trial advocacy - limited as they are in South Africa10 - \nhave a constrained, tightly-focused form. They tend to be outer-directed in the \nsense that their goal is to enhance the skills of participants, rather than to examine \nthe assumptions underlying the adversary system. It is fair to say that the primary \ntrial skills emphasised in professional trial advocacy courses are (i) question \nformation; (ii) witness control; and (iii) persuasive presentation.11 \nThese courses cannot but have limited aims, because practising lawyers have \nlimited time. There is only so much that could be accomplished in a two or three \nday (or even a seven or ten day) workshop. Also, frankly, there is only so much \nthat practising lawyers are interested in learning. In professional education, it is \n                                            \n5  Michelman 1982 J Leg Ed 354. \n6  No-one is advocating that university law schools should graduate polished trial-court \nperformers. See, for example, Tauro 1970 ABA J 461. There is, after all, a limit on what \ncan be achieved in the relatively cloistered surroundings of the law school. Just as the \nmedical student cannot, in the end, fully develop her bedside manner at the side of a desk, \nor her surgical technique from a textbook, so too must the law student eventually depart \nfrom the classroom to refine her practical skills. Kaufman 1974 Sw L J 500. \n7  Burger 1980-1981 Fordham L Rev 21. \n8  Levin 1965 Buff L Rev 390. \n9  Broun 1977 ABA J 1220. \n10  As far as I am aware, the only professional courses in trial advocacy specifically for \nneophyte lawyers are offered by the various Societies of Advocates to pupils (a weekend \nseminar) and by Legal Aid of South Africa to candidate attorneys (a two-day seminar). \n11  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 724. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  4 \nsimply commonplace for individuals to target their skills and work to enhance \nthem.12 That is why professional courses must centre on skills that can be \ndemonstrated, acquired, used and refined in rapid succession. There is little \nspace, nor need there be, for reflection and introspection.13 \nI do not point out these limitations to criticise professional courses in trial \nadvocacy. Rather, I offer them as part of the explanation of why we should teach \ntrial advocacy in law school. Advocacy education cannot simply be picked up in \npractice. There are far more layers of thought to advocacy education than can \nreasonably be explored in even the best professional course.14 The pedagogical \nadvantage of the university course in trial advocacy is that it can be much more \nbroadly paced than any practice course ever could. A university course in trial \nadvocacy offers us the opportunity to merge substance, ethics, and persuasion \nin a unified instructional setting. Since good teaching motivates continuous \nthought and reflection, both on the subject of the course and the larger normative \nissues, time for such reflection can be built into a university course. If students \nare truly to explore alternative trial theories, they need days, not hours, in which \nto think and prepare.15 \nLaw schools are generally in a better position than practice to offer clinical \neducation.16 We have more time to teach skills in context, to discuss the \napplication of theory to particular practical situations, and to reflect on the \napproaches that work and the reasons why they work. Allowing students to \nintegrate skills and doctrine while at university, with time to think about the "hows" \nand "whys", will make them better, more responsible lawyers. Trial by fire, in the \nhustle and bustle of practice, is not the optimal way of acquiring a fundamental \nunderstanding of why some approaches, tactics and methods are more effective \nthan others, especially considering that mistakes in practice occur at the expense \nof clients, and perhaps to one\'s own professional reputation. \n2 Why trial advocacy? \nAlthough I strongly believe that the LLB curriculum should also include courses \nin legal writing, negotiation, client counselling, and witness interviewing, I \n                                            \n12  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 723. \n13  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 725. Law schools, of course, are not constrained in \nsimilar fashion, and also partake of a broader mission. Modern legal education differs from \napprenticeship precisely because law schools have become fully integrated into the \nuniversity. Membership in the university requires a closer examination of assumptions, \npractices and norms. \n14  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 724. \n15  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 734-735. \n16  See Devitt and Roland 1987 Wm Mitchell L Rev 446 and the sources cited there. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  5 \nemphasise adding a clinical course in trial advocacy to the LLB curriculum for a \nnumber of specific reasons. \n2.1 The process or prospect of litigation touches the life of almost every \nlawyer \nThe absence of a university trial advocacy course in South Africa has always \nstruck me as a curious deficiency, given the centrality of the trial to our conception \nof justice. The litigation paradigm dominates legal discourse. Undeniably, every \nlegal issue or dispute, regardless of the area of law, has the potential to end up \nin the courtroom or an alternative dispute resolution forum, requiring a trial or \nsome other formal proceeding that would necessitate the use of advocacy skills.17 \nIn sum, the process or prospect of litigation touches the life of almost every \nlawyer.18 \nThe legal realist, Jerome Frank,19 proclaimed: \nLitigation is the ultimate reference for the lawyer … [I]n the last analysis, legal rights \nand duties … are nothing more or nothing less than actual or potential successes \nand failures in lawsuits. A lawyer who has inadequate acquaintance with litigious \nprocesses is, relatively, an impotent lawyer … When you come to practice, and \nacting for your client … draw his will … or organize a corporation, or negotiate the \nsettlement of a controversy, or draft a legislative bill, you will - or should be - \nconcerned with how the courts will act. If you are competent, you will, as best you \ncan, try to answer this question: ‘What will happen if those specific documents or \ntransactions hereafter become a part of the drama of a trial?’ \nIt would be a mistake to emphasis the word "trial" in trial advocacy. Although the \ndominant purpose of this course would be to train students in the nuts and bolts \nof trial, trial advocacy is not simply the skill of persuasion. Trial advocacy is:20 \n[T]he composition of fact-extraction, legal reasoning, strategic judgment, and \npersuasive speech, structured by … the rules of professional responsibility, \nevidence, procedure and stative rules. \nThus, trial advocacy skills are not exclusively the skills of the courtroom, but they \nalso live and breathe in the everyday practice of law.21 A skilful trial lawyer is not \nmerely a technician trained in the mechanics of courtroom skills and etiquette, \nbut a lawyer who is able to extract the pertinent facts from a seeming maze of \ninformation, integrate those facts with legal principles, and present a reasoned \n                                            \n17  Mannion 2009-2010 Pace L Rev 1203. \n18  Tigar 1990 Rev Litig 185. \n19  Frank 1947 Yale L J 1305-1306. \n20  Gianantonio 2012 Duq L Rev 495; Ohlbaum 1993 Temp L Rev 26; Wolfe 1980-1981 16 \nTulsa L J 210. \n21  Wolfe 1980-1981 Tulsa L J 210. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  6 \nargument.22 If one conceives of an "advocate" in the broadest sense as every \nlawyer who advises or acts for a client in legal matters, it becomes clear that the \nskills taught in trial advocacy relate to nearly every conceivable aspect of the \npractice of law, both inside and outside the courtroom. \nCourtroom skills, after all, do not exist in a vacuum. The ability to elicit facts from \na witness in the witness box is dependent on the trial lawyer\'s ability to elicit facts \nduring the pre-trial consultation with that witness. For example, United States \nChief Justice Warren E Burger,23 stated the following with regard to the skill of \ninterviewing: \nThe shortcoming of today\'s law graduate lies not in deficient knowledge of the law \nbut that he has little, if any training, in dealing with facts or people - the stuff of which \ncases are really made. It is a rare graduate … who knows how to ask questions - \nsimple, single questions, one at a time, in order to develop facts in evidence either \nin interviewing a witness or examining him in a courtroom. And a lawyer who cannot \ndo that cannot perform properly - in or out of court. \nIt is true that the full range of a lawyer\'s skills is tested in the intense and \ndemanding environment of the courtroom. These courtroom skills, however, are \nilluminated versions of the skills which every lawyer must possess to represent \nher client\'s interests effectively.24 Put simply, trial advocacy training readily \ntransfers to the broad spectrum of the legal fora in which lawyers practice. For \nwhenever a lawyer negotiates, or puts a proposition to a client, or even when she \ndiscusses a difference of opinion with a partner, she is engaged in advocacy - the \nprocess of trying to convince people of something, or the technique of \npersuasion.25 \n2.2 The pedagogical value of a trial advocacy course \nThe importance of a university course in trial advocacy to the development of the \nyoung legal mind cannot be overstated. In addition to learning how to prepare \nand present a trial from the opening speech through to the closing argument, \nstudents also learn (and, in some cases, re-learn) and apply the procedural, \nsubstantive and ethical rules of law.26 In the law of contracts, students learn to \nsearch for consideration, and the law of delict provides instruction on the \nelements of negligence; however, in a trial advocacy setting students have the \nopportunity to apply the lessons from the substantive, procedural and ethical \n                                            \n22  Williams 1999-2000 Stetson L Rev 1230. \n23  As quoted in Wolfe 1980-1981 Tulsa L J 211. \n24  Wolfe 1980-1981 Tulsa L J 211. \n25  Hanrahan 2003 BYU Educ & L J 302. \n26  See, generally, Gianantonio 2012 Duq L Rev 486, 497. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  7 \ndoctrines that are traditionally dealt with in discrete subjects, in a manner \nnecessary to actually prove or defend a cause of action.27 \n2.3 The reputation of the legal profession \nTrial lawyers, who hold the liberties and property of clients under their control, \nhave an awesome responsibility to discharge. The public has a right to expect \nthat trial lawyers will be competent. Most of a trial lawyer\'s professional \nperformance takes place in the goldfish bowl that is the courtroom, where \neverything can be observed.28 There is no other time during which the lawyer\'s \nconduct becomes so visibly essential to the judicial process, and is so acutely \nexperienced by the client.29 As far as the client is concerned - who has to watch \nher trial lawyer in court and who must stand and fall on the performance - the one \nincompetent lawyer with whom she deals may represent the sum total of her \ncontact with the law.30 \nIf university law schools fail to contribute to establishing a substantial body of \ncompetent trial attorneys, our failure will ultimately take its toll on our system of \njustice.31 As with the consumers of medical services, it is the lawyer\'s clients who \nsuffer the most serious consequences. The quality of courtroom advocacy directly \naffects the rights of litigants, the costs of litigation, the proper functioning of the \njustice system, and, ultimately, the quality of justice.32 A profession that enjoys a \nmonopoly on legal services through public licence must respect the public interest \nand solve these problems.33 \nThe concept of "professional responsibility" encompasses much more than \nsimply the ethics involved in the lawyer-client relationship. It also includes the \nresponsibility of the legal profession to ensure that legal services are available to \nall members of society, and that those legal services are adequate and \nconsistent.34 It is the disadvantaged members of society whose interests are most \nlikely to be prejudiced by a lack of competence in trial lawyers. The indigent are \nless able to retain qualified trial counsel and, as a consequence, are often left at \nthe mercy of the inexperienced lawyer who learns by trial and error, too often at \nthe client\'s expense. \n                                            \n27  Gianantonio 2012 Duq L Rev 495-496. \n28  Burger 1967-1968 Washburn L J 16. \n29  Wolfe 1980-1981 Tulsa L J 211. \n30  Clare 1975-1976 St John\'s L Rev 467. \n31  Wolfe 1980-1981 Tulsa L J 212. \n32  Burger 1980 Clev St L Rev 381. \n33  Burger 1980-1981 Fordham L Rev 20. \n34  Tauro 1976 B U L Rev 637. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  8 \nWe must eliminate the injustices that necessarily arise when the outcome of a \nlawsuit is determined, not by the merits of the cause, but by the skill of the \nlawyers.35 We must never lose sight of the fact that our adversary system is \nfounded in the principle that the most direct path toward fairness and truth is one \nwhere the adversaries are as equally matched as the constraints of human \nfrailties would permit.36 \n2.4 Understanding the law of evidence \nIt is trite that knowing the rules of evidence and applying them are two very \ndifferent things. In fact, one can truly learn them only by applying them, and not \nby studying them,37 because their meaning and significance emerge only in the \ncontext of a trial.38 For example, hearsay as a rule is fairly easily stated, but its \nproper application typically evades law students. While this rule is explored in the \nlaw of evidence course, its application in an adversarial setting brings the lessons \nto life, often "connecting the dots" for students who may not otherwise have fully \nunderstood the rules from studying a textbook and reading cases. \nA university course in trial advocacy would give our students a better grounding \nin the law of evidence than they would receive if they studied it as a soon-to-beforgotten\ntypical upper-class LLB offering. This is true, even for students who will \nnever get near a courtroom, but who will still need to know something about the \nrules of evidence to protect their clients from the hazards of litigation. What they \nneed to know is not the rule as such but precisely what goes on in a courtroom. \nA course in trial advocacy will give them a good sense of that.39 \n2.5 Enhancing law students\' ability to deal with facts \nWhat do lawyers really do? If you ask this question of any handful of law students, \nthey would likely respond that lawyers litigate, do commercial work, draft wills and \ncontracts, advise on tax matters, and the like. They would be fundamentally \nincorrect. In a remarkable survey by the American Bar Foundation, practising \nlawyers responded that what they do, day in and day out, is investigate, gather, \nresearch, assimilate, and understand the relevance of facts.40 \n                                            \n35  Berger and Mitchell 1992 Am J Trial Advoc 837. \n36  Kaufman 1974 Sw L J 497. \n37  Just as, states Posner, one can learn how to ride a bicycle only by doing it, and not by \nstudying the pertinent rules of physics. Posner 2001 LQR 731. \n38   Posner 2001 LQR 731. \n39  Posner 2001 LQR 734. \n40  This holds true for responses across all the lines of expertise in the profession. See \ngenerally Zemans and Rosenblum Making of a Public Profession. It is difficult to overstate \nthe importance of facts to the practising lawyer. The most critical section of heads of \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  9 \nWe teach our students how to "spot issues". We generally begin with our students \nwhen the facts have been established, the factual dispute resolved.41 Our \nstudents fail to realise - because we fail to teach them - that the facts of the only \ncase that matters - the client\'s - will not jump up from an appellate opinion or a \nprofessor\'s hypothetical in the exam. The actual facts of a lawsuit "do not walk \ninto the courtroom", as the facts of hypotheticals do in the law school exam \nroom.42 \nThus, in a real sense, we teach students to think of facts backward. At the outset \nof any legal conflict, little is known about the complex of data, recollection and \nhuman emotions that are referred to as the "facts" during trial.43 A lawyer must \nfind the facts of a case by searching for them. And when the lawyer has rounded \nup the facts, she must turn each one over in her hand to see whether or not it is \narguably admissible under a rule of evidence.44 Only after the lawyer has taken \nthe process of searching and analysing the facts quite some distance will she be \nable to apply legal rules in the sense that traditional law teaching emphasises.45 \nThe university course in trial advocacy would stress sustained involvement with \nfacts. Rather than rely upon short, unitary problems - as professional courses of \nnecessity often do - it would utilise case files that are nuanced, complex and \ndetailed. The facts of the case would be subject to continual re-evaluation, and \nthe students would be required to work with the same file preferably for the \nduration of the course. \nFrom the outset students would have to sort out a complex of factual data from a \nvariety of sources and, through the application of the concept of relevance, submit \na narrative of selected facts, the purpose of which would be to persuade the \nreader (the trial advocacy instructor) as to the probability of what had occurred.46 \n                                            \nargument or an appellate brief is not the case law cited, but the statement of facts. And the \nkey to writing an effective statement of facts "is a question of making the facts talk. For … \nit is the facts, not the advocate\'s expressed opinions, which must do the talking. The court \nis interested not in listening to any lawyer rant, but in seeing, or better, in discovering, from \nand in the facts, where sense and justice lie". Karl Llewellyn as cited in Imwinkelried 19881989\nGa L Rev 678. \n41  Burger 1980-1981 Fordham L Rev 3. To be sure, we endeavour to teach our students to \ndraw distinctions among cases and doctrines. The result is that our students have at least \nan appreciation for facts in the context of using them in heads of argument and legal \nmemoranda to support legal contentions. However, this teaches sensitivity to facts from \nonly one end of the spectrum.

It is at this \nstage that students may manifest a lack of logic, or a tendency to "create" facts, \nor to manipulate them beyond ethical or common sense limits. Catching these \nproblems at the outset of the trial advocacy course would do a great deal to instill \nin our students an understanding of the limits of proper advocacy.47  \nAfter sifting all of the material and learning the rudiments of client interview \ntechniques, the student trial lawyers would be required to write a comprehensive \nmemorandum of fact and of law. This document would organise all the materials \ninto a theory of the case from which further proceedings may go forward - that \namalgam of fact, law and inference which is the strongest argument that can be \nmustered on behalf of the client.48 \n2.6 Teaching strategy \nMost traditional law school courses, and almost all law school exams, emphasise \nfast thinking and quick returns. A university trial advocacy course, on the other \nhand, would offer the opportunity to educate students in strategy. A lawyer\'s \nstrategic thinking begins with the identification of a goal; the recognition of the \nobjectives that might reasonably be achieved through the legal process. \nThereafter, the lawyer must formulate a route within the law for the attainment of \nthat goal. To do that, the lawyer needs to evaluate the consequences, favourable \nand unfavourable, of the various available choices, and map the alternative \napproaches. This, in turn, calls for risk assessment and, ultimately, for \ndecisiveness. These aspects of the structural knowledge of the law are not \ncovered elsewhere in the traditional LLB curriculum.49 \n2.6 Teaching professionalism and ethics \nTraditional law school teaching in legal ethics is necessarily abstract and acontextual.50\nIt can be effective at providing instruction in the law of lawyering, \nbut it is seldom as productive when it comes to examining more subtle questions. \nThe university trial advocacy course, on the other hand, is the ideal forum in which \nto raise ambiguous and textured ethical issues.51 \nIn the context of trial advocacy, ethics problems cannot be avoided or \nrationalised, because the student trial lawyer must always make a personal \ndecision. In the ethics classroom, it is always possible to say that the rules do not \n                                            \n47  Ordover 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 818. \n48  Ordover 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 816-817, 819. \n49  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 730. \n50  Meyers 1997 J Leg Ed 403. \n51  Burns 1995 LCP 37-50. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  11 \nprovide a clear answer or that there are several conceivable answers. But in the \ncourtroom, even the simulated courtroom, the trial lawyer must make a choice \nand live with it. In the ethics classroom, it is all too easy to say what lawyers \nshould do. In the simulated courtroom, students have to show what they have \nchosen to do. The cost of decision-making becomes real.52 \nThe simulated courtroom offers the opportunity to develop the moral fibre and \nproper instincts for dealing with ethical problems in a professionally responsible \nway. Learning about ethics comes easier, no doubt, when the student faces a \nmoral dilemma, than when she is standing outside a problem and commenting \non it.53 \nIn a university trial advocacy course, if the case files are properly structured, and \nif the participating witnesses are properly briefed, there is a broad scope for the \ninfusion of ethics and professionalism.54 This includes macro-ethical issues, such \nas what type of lawyers students desire to become, and how they will maintain a \nsense of professionalism without sacrificing competence at the client\'s expense.55 \nThe trial advocacy course would also be the ideal setting for micro-ethical issues. \nFor example, consider the classic case of the witness who changes her story \nwhile in the witness box. The instructor can coach the student "role-playing" such \na witness to give one version to the student trial lawyer prior to trial, and a \ncompletely different version during examination-in-chief. How the student trial \nlawyer deals with the situation could form the basis of a constructive class \ndiscussion that aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Consider \nalso the question of cross-examining a truthful witness; or the extent of \npermissible witness preparation; or the tactical use of motions and trial \nobjections.56 There are no clear answers to any of these questions, but it is certain \nthat they can most profitably be investigated in the context of preparing for and \nconducting a simulated trial.57 \n                                            \n52  Lubet 1994 J Leg Ed 87-88. \n53  Burger 1980 Clev St L Rev 392. \n54  McCrimmon 1994 Legal Educ Rev 18.  \n55  Berger and Mitchell 1992 Am J Trial Advoc 822. \n56  Also see Levin 1965 Buff L Rev 394. \n57  Lubet 1994 J Leg Ed 87. Practising trial lawyers disagree on the precise limits, and on the \npropriety or impropriety of a particular course of conduct. There is no reason why the \nstudents should achieve agreement. What is important, however, is that they become \nsensitised to the existence of these problems, that they be exposed to a candid exploration \nof the implications of proffered alternatives, and that they be invited to seek solutions. Levin \n1965 Buff L Rev 394. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  12 \nLitigation insights deepen the meaning of lawyers\' ethical and professional \nresponsibilities.58 The resolution of ethical problems is best studied and learned \nin the theatre of action.59 Michael Tiger60 explains: \nEthics dead and in books are artifacts. The only ethics that matter are ethics alive \nand in use. The only way to make ethics live is to recreate for students what lawyers \ndo and what choices lawyers make … Teaching ethics alive in the work of lawyers \ngives students a deeper sense of the adversary\'s system\'s built-in correctives. \n3 Structure and content of the university trial advocacy course \nLearning, especially where trial advocacy is concerned, is not a spectator sport. \nThe skills of advocacy cannot be acquired, except by the very gifted, by listening \nto a lecture or reading a book.61 If students are taught only theory, they will not \ncome to appreciate the pressures and responsibilities that arise in the trial \ncontext. Nor will they come to understand how real time strategies and decisions \ncan have a serious impact on the outcome of a client\'s case.62 \nPedagogically, the rationale for teaching trial advocacy primarily through \nsimulation is that the most powerful method to learn and understand a skill is \nthrough performance.63 Trial advocacy pedagogy is thus fundamentally learningby-doing.\nOur students must acquire the skills needed for dealing with the \ncontingencies of the courtroom, as opposed to the classroom.64 Indeed, the use \nof simulation - putting the student in the position of a trial lawyer in the courtroom \n- is the most effective way in which undergraduate law students can develop \nadvocacy skills.65 Such courses provide the learning experiences that help \ntransition law students into law practitioners. While the fundamental purpose of \nthe LLB curriculum is to teach and enforce legal reasoning and analysis, the \nexperiential trial advocacy course takes these lessons to the next logical step - \nshowing law students how to be lawyers. \nThe course material presents students with real choices: students may rely on all \nor part of the material, and they are not bound to some court\'s view of the facts. \nThus, individual choice and judgment play a role in teaching that they cannot \nhave in typical doctrinal courses, in which discussion is limited to analysis of a \n                                            \n58  Carlson 1988 Ga L Rev 699. \n59  Tigar 1990 Rev Litig 196. \n60  Tigar 1990 Rev Litig 197. \n61  Schaller 1972 ABA J 1280. \n62  Mannion 2009-2010 Pace L Rev 1205. \n63  Lubet calls the simulated courtroom procedure "one of the most advanced teaching \nmethods used in any law school course".

Moreover, as opposed to the classroom setting, the \nteaching of trial advocacy itself is always aimed at the individual student.66 \nTrial advocacy teaching, modelled on the "simulation/critique" methodology \npioneered in the early 1970s by the National Institute of Trial Advocacy (NITA) in \nthe United States, is now utilised in almost every accredited law school in the \nUnited States.67 It is also in use, in some form, in professional trial advocacy \ncourses in most common law jurisdictions. NITA has mastered the art of \nconceptualising and communicating trial advocacy skills.68 The NITA method has \nmade lawyers think more systematically about preparation and performance.69 In \na nutshell, the simulation/critique or "learning-by-doing" trial advocacy pedagogy \nconsists of students performing all the tasks of trial lawyers in a simulated \ncourtroom environment, and generally involves the following steps:70 \n(1) The students receive a lecture about the trial advocacy skill being taught \nand, ideally, also watch a demonstration of the skill by two experienced \ninstructors. \n(2) Next, the individual students each perform the skill. \n(3) Each student then receives feedback on her performance immediately \nthereafter from the instructor as follows: \n(i)  Headline — The instructor will identify one issue (usually the most \nglaring mistake) through the use of a headline, which is a simple \nstatement, such as "I want to talk to you about leading on cross". This \nfocusses the group and instructor on a specific point. The rationale \nfor keeping to one teachable point per student is that, in the group \nsetting, it keeps the information to be absorbed on a manageable \nlevel and prevents any one student from feeling singled out.  \n(ii) Playback — After the instructor has identified the issue with a \nheadline, she will then engage in "playback", a process whereby the \ninstructor will read verbatim three examples that highlight the issue \nidentified in the headline.

Our challenge is, of course, \nto build upon the simulation/critique method to develop a university model of \nadvocacy education.71 As a first step we should engage in the systematic and \ncareful planning of the university trial advocacy curriculum. At the most basic \nlevel, the university trial advocacy course should enhance our students' ability to \ncommunicate persuasively and to learn to act ethically while carrying out lawyers' \ntasks.72 We should teach them basic advocacy skills, how lawyers make \ndecisions in the courtroom, and the pressures that trial lawyers typically face.73 \nHowever, if the discipline is to grow and prosper, the trial advocacy teacher \nshould also give the course more texture by going beyond the teaching of trial \nskills, and infuse it with instruction in evidence, legal ethics, procedure, litigation \nplanning, the encouragement of critical thinking about the litigation and trial \nprocess, and the lawyer's role in the adversary system.74 In short, we should also \nbe teaching the norms and values in support of which our students' trial skills will \nbe applied.75 \n                                            \n71  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 724. \n72  Hyman 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 767. \n73  Mannion 2009-2010 Pace L Rev 1195. \n74  Geraghty 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 689, 694. \n75  Lubet 1987 J Leg Ed 126. \n", 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  15 \nUniversity education in the professions absolutely requires inquiry and \ninvestigation that goes beyond simple skills training.76 This obligation derives \nfrom our position in the university, and the status and nature of the legal \nprofession itself. In both contexts, law teachers strive for more than simply \ntechnical proficiency. We strive for achievements measured in terms of \ncontributions to society. \nHowever, clinical courses, especially those modelled on the highly successful \nprogrammes of NITA, focus almost exclusively on lawyering techniques, without \nadequate reflection on the philosophical and psychological underpinnings of \nthose techniques.77 Such skills courses "spend too much time on the firing range, \ntoo little in cool reflection".78 For example, participants are taught "Never ask \n\'why?\' on cross-examination", without being forced to grapple with whether these \nlessons are coherent with any jurisprudential or psychological theory.79 No class \ndiscussion is evoked concerning the limits of cross-examination that goes beyond \nmere skills training in its positing of ethical dilemmas, or exploration of the \nrelationship between the formal rules of ethics and the trial lawyer\'s choice of \ntheory.80 If students\' only academic encounter with lawyering skills is limited to \ntechnocratic concerns, the message is obvious - in the real world nothing else \nmatters.81 \nIf a trial advocacy course (and other courses in lawyering skills) focusses \nexclusively on vocational training, it will have failed. Courses in interviewing, \nnegotiation, counselling and advocacy deserve a permanent place in the basic \nLLB curriculum of the university-based professional law school only if they \nbroaden and deepen the LLB curriculum, ie, if they are founded on insightful, \ntheoretical explanations of why lawyers and officials behave as they do, and what \neffect the use of their trial skills might have.82  \nThey should also enable legal academics to produce important empirical findings \nthat illuminate how lawyers, clients, and officials behave and interact, and lead to \nvaluable normative statements of how they should behave.83 A successful course \nin trial advocacy must move beyond simply learning by doing - although skills \ntraining would be the linchpin of the curriculum. It must also explore, in an \n                                            \n76  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 733.

Educating students in trial \nadvocacy is in many ways the same as arming them. The well-trained trial lawyer \nis placed in a position of relative power and influence over other peoples\' lives. It \nshould go without saying that with power comes responsibility. Thus, as the \npurveyors of a skill that leads to power, trial advocacy teachers are obliged to \nteach the meaning of responsibility.87 \nThe potential dangers of teaching lawyering skills through simulation - a context \ndevoid of real clients and events - are two-fold. Firstly, doing so might \ncommunicate to students that lawyers have no obligation to the truth. They cannot \nengage in a search for "what really happened", because in the simulated context, \nnothing did. The exercise runs the risk of degenerating into a game, in which the \nlawyer\'s role is to manipulate the few given facts into any theory that could \nprevail.88 \n                                            \n84  Tauro 1976 B U L Rev 645. \n85  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 733. \n86  Hegland 1982 J Leg Ed 86. \n87  Lubet 1987 J Leg Ed 139. It is true that the trial is our means of achieving justice in cases \nof ultimate dispute, and that advocacy skills equip practitioners to engage in trials. Lubet \n1987 J Leg Ed 127. But advocacy skills do more than that. They equip the lawyer to lead \nand to mislead; to ferret out but also to obscure, and to persuade without regard to the \nunderlying value of the position in question. These skills, if taught in a value-free vacuum, \nneither advance justice nor contribute to any other discernible social goal. The fact is \ninescapable that the trial lawyer learns the art of deception, if not through brazen falsehood, \nthen at least through purposeful implication. Lubet 1987 J Leg Ed 127. \n88  Hegland 1982 J Leg Ed 72. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  17 \nThe university course in trial advocacy should shy away from a series of short \nproblems in favour of one comprehensive case file. One reason for this is that \nshort problems are used to allow students to exercise a discreet skill, for example: \n"Given these facts, cross-examine witness X." Since the problems are all \ncircumscribed by the text of the printed page, they allow no discussion of truth. In \nfact, there is no truth. All possibilities are equally valid and limited only by the \nimprecise concept of "inherent plausibility". And even with regard to plausibility \nwe face a conundrum, since in real life, the truth itself may turn out to be \nimplausible.89 Teaching in simulation necessarily sacrifices truth. The printed \nproblem constitutes the universe, and the students must work only with such \nmaterial, true or not, as is available.90 \nSecondly, because skills are taught in the moral vacuum of the hypothetical case, \nthe lesson from a purely skills perspective seems to be that the lawyer\'s only goal \nis winning, no matter the issue and no matter the cost.91 That is why the goal with \nsuch a course can never merely be to teach "paid assassins to aim better".92 If \nwe teach advocacy skills simply as a technique that students can employ to win \ncases, then a university trial advocacy course would be a perversion of the \naspiration of the university, and would not deserve a place in the LLB \ncurriculum.93 A course in trial advocacy has the rich and unique potential to allow \nstudents to critically and thoughtfully examine the normative side of the lawyering \nprocess, beyond the mastery of forensic skills. \n3.3 The structure of the theoretical component of the university trial \nadvocacy course  \nAs I envision the university trial advocacy course, approximately the first half of \nthe first semester would be devoted to a theoretical component that I tentatively \ncall "trial law". \nIt bears repeating that a curriculum that focuses exclusively on skills and tactics \nis pedagogically unwise. It gives students an incomplete picture of what they need \nto know about trials. Pure trial skills courses rarely present opportunities for \n                                            \n89  Lubet 1987 J Leg Ed 128. \n90  Lubet 1987 J Leg Ed 129. \n91  Hegland 1982 J Leg Ed 70. \n92  Hegland 1982 J Leg Ed 69. Too often, trials are considered games or spectacles in which \nthe most cunning adversary will be rewarded with success. Lost in this belief is the fact that \nlawyers are, first and foremost, officers of the Court. We should always reinforce with our \nstudents that a trial "is truly more than a soap opera or a sporting match. Most of all, a trial \nis a contest of ideas, a process in which the law is applied to the facts". Lubet Modern Trial \nAdvocacy 1. \n93  Allen 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 717.

This would be \nantithetical to the intellectual mission of the university law school. \nThe theoretical component of the university trial advocacy course might cover \nthree aspects of trials.95 Firstly, it could provide students with an overview of the \nlong history of trials, especially old forms of adjudication, such as ordeals, the \ninquisition, witch trials, the trials of animals, corpses and things, and more \nbroadly, the Moscow show trials, the war crimes trials, and the OJ Simpson trial \nas an exemplar of jury trials.96 The purpose of the historical component would be \nto engage students in a critical appraisal of current trial practices, with questions \nposed such as: Was medieval divine adjudication irrational? Was eighteenth \ncentury secular justice rational? Did these trials "work"? In what sense (or, for \nwhom)? To the extent that such trial practices were popularly accepted, why did \nthe populace accept a system of adjudication that by our values seems \nprofoundly flawed?97 \nSecondly, students should engage in an intellectual exploration of the theories of \nadvocacy, and of questioning the legal system and the lawyer\'s role.98 Students \nshould read selections from the substantial body of literature on the theory of \ntrials. In this regard the classic debate between Lon Fuller and Jerome Frank, \nover the relative merits of zealous advocacy and truth seeking, might serve as a \nfocus.99 Also, students might examine the effectiveness of the methods by which \nthe adversary system reaches its conception of justice.100 \nThe third part of the theoretical component might use the trial as a vehicle for \ndiscussing several catholic jurisprudential issues, such as, for example, the myth \nof rational judicial decision-making,101 the myth of judicial neutrality,102 the \npolitically influenced exercise of judicial discretion;103 the appropriate role of \n                                            \n94  Tanford 1991 J Leg Ed 254. \n95  In this regard I rely on an excellent article by J Alexander Tanford, who has implemented a \nsemester-long theoretical course called "Trial Law" at Indiana University at Bloomington \nLaw School.

That will also be the focus of the entirety of the \nsecond semester of the university trial advocacy course. However, exclusive \nemphasis on the trial alone highlights the combative, competitive impulses that \nbudding young lawyers are often all too willing to adopt.106 Thus, the second half \nof the first semester should be devoted to teaching the other skills required of trial \nlawyers - skills in interviewing and counselling a client, preparing a witness, and \nnegotiating a settlement. \n3.3 The structure of the practical component of the university trial \nadvocacy course \nIt seems worthwhile to state, in general terms, some desirable aspects of the \npractical component of a university trial advocacy course:107 \n(1) Student interest and engagement demand that as many students as \npossible be involved as much of the time as is practicable.  \n(2) Every student must have the opportunity to be trial counsel in a full trial, \neither individually or as co-counsel in a team of two. Responsibility should \nnot be divided into more than two parts, because students\' synthesis of the \nparts of a trial cannot be thorough until they have employed all of the major \nskills and techniques in a complete trial. Understandably, this goal \nnecessitates classes with limited enrolment.  \n(3) The "case file" designed to teach the basic subject should be multi-levelled \nto include all of the following elements: (i) a realistic factual dispute; (ii) a \nchallenging substantive law problems; (iii) significant evidentiary and \nprocedural difficulties; (iv) witness difficulties (eg, vulnerable, forgetful, lying, \nand expert witnesses); (v) ethical issues; (vi) an even balance; and (vii) the \nability to be tried in approximately three hours. \nTo facilitate strategic planning, instead of working through a number of problems \nof fact, each designed to highlight a particular skill, students should work with one \ncase file for a substantial period of time, preferably the entire course. The \n                                            \n104  See, for example, Saks and Hastie Social Psychology in Court; Bennett and Feldman \nReconstructing Reality in the Courtroom. \n105  See, for example, Gravett (Part 1) 2017 PELJ 1-25; Gravett (Part 2) 2017 PELJ 1-25. \n106  Tuoni 1991 Loy LA L Rev 123. \n107  McElhaney 1974 U Miami L Rev 212-213. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  20 \nrationale for the single case file approach is to avoid the students looking upon a \ntrial as a "fragmented bundle of performance skills rather than as a coherent \nstrategic endeavor".108 \nA great part of what effective trial lawyers do is to strategise, plan and prepare. \nThus, students should also learn how to strategise and plan like trial lawyers, and \nnot merely to mimic them. Students must learn how to develop the overall \nconceptual structures that guide experienced trial lawyers.109 The latter do not \nview cross-examinations and witness interviews as a fragmented, unrelated \nseries of skills performances. Rather, each performance skill is guided by and \nacts in service of an evolving case theory. This evolving case theory conjoins the \ndeterminative legal standards in the lawsuit with an interrelated and supporting \nfactual narrative.110 \nCase theory is the conceptual path to a practical destination that allows a student \nto understand the analytical skills of fact evaluation and integration with legal \nprinciples.111 In addition to the importance of forensic skills - asking questions \nand making speeches - there is learning how to develop a theory of the case, \nwhich is "the basic, underlying and comprehensive idea that accounts for and \nexplains all of the [facts] . . . [in] a coherent and credible whole".112 Thus, we \nshould place emphasis on a structural understanding of the adversarial system. \nAlso, because students spend the duration of the course on a single case file, \nthey will be able to gain a relatively fluid command of a complex factual scenario. \nStudents will learn the core mental process of evaluating and re-evaluating \ninformation in the context of refining their case theories; to concentrate on \nthinking very hard about the more sophisticated nuances of various aspects of \nthe case. They will also experience what really understanding a case and \nthoroughly preparing for it will look and feel like in practice.113 \n                                            \n108  Berger and Mitchell 1992 Am J Trial Advoc 829-830. \n109  Berger and Mitchell 1992 Am J Trial Advoc 829-830. \n110  Berger and Mitchell 1992 Am J Trial Advoc 832. \n111  Ohlbaum 1993 Temp L Rev 5, 17; Lubet 1994 J Leg Ed 81-82. \n112  Ohlbaum 1993 Temp L Rev 4. \n113  Berger and Mitchell 1992 Am J Trial Advoc 822. In teaching trial advocacy, Kenety designs \nhis case files so that it behooves students to actually visit the scene of the crime or accident. \nFor example, an eye witness would claim that she was at point X when she clearly saw all \nthat had transpired at point Y. In Kenety\'s experience, the more inquisitive students would \nvisit the scene and quickly discern that there is no possibility of seeing point Y from point \nX. Wonderful cross-examination possibilities develop. Kenety also deliberately does not \nhand out complete case files to students, thereby forcing students to purposefully request \ncertain records. For example, the complexion of an accident case changes markedly if it \ntranspires that the driver has a string of prior convictions for speeding, drunk driving and \nother assorted vehicular offences. Students need only knock on his door and request to \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  21 \nTo inject a breath of reality and relevance into the process, instructors should \ndevelop their own case files, and set factual scenarios in locations with which the \nstudents are familiar.114 There are three distinct advantages to instructors \ncreating their own case files: (i) it heightens the students\' interest by localising \nthe problems, using real geographic locations and local legal developments; (ii) \nthe instructor can tailor the problem to include aspects of trial advocacy that the \ninstructor believes to be important; and (iii) it avoids the un-reality and monotony \nthat are inherent in most "canned" problems.115 \n(4) Instructors should use video review of students\' performances. As James \nMcElhaney116 notes, most effective critiques immediately follow students\' \nindividual performances. Video review also provides an excellent \nopportunity for the instructor to give personal attention to the student.117 \nVideo review is effective, because people are naturally fascinated at seeing \nthemselves, and after the initial shock of self-recognition, they learn quickly \nfrom their mistakes.118 Some authors maintain that "there is no other source \nof evaluation so effective in offering nonjudgmental feedback" as video \nreview.119 \n(5) In general, by limiting students to around 28 per instructor, approximately \nhalf the semester (seven or eight weeks) could be devoted to exercises that \ndirectly track the individual trial skills according to the substantive outline, \nwhile the second half could be devoted to having each student serve as cocounsel\nin the trial of a complete case. The goal of this format would be to \nmaximise the learning of discrete trial skills and make the synthesis of those \nskills fundamentally complete, given the limitations of a single semester. \n(6) Universal preparation would be required for all exercises during the first half \nof the semester. Any student could be called upon to conduct the \nexamination of a witness, give an opening speech, or make a final \nargument. \n(7) "Laboratory periods" in which students engage in the exercises should run \nfor about four hours every week, preceded by a separate lecture period of \n                                            \nenter the "Motor Vehicle Administration" to be rewarded with such details. Those students \nthat do not, learn the hard way.

Each trial would \nimmediately be followed by a critique of student performance, involving \ncomments from the instructor as well as written evaluations from the other \nstudents. Also, during the second half of the semester the period previously \nused for lectures would now be set aside for witness consultation and \npreparation. \n(9) By utilising judges and witnesses from outside the class and even the \nuniversity community, instructors can engender a sense of realism and \nexcitement in cases that have been carefully structured for maximum \nlearning content. \n(10) Real-world trials are all too often full of surprises. So, too, should simulated \ntrials present a few unpleasant surprises. The instructor could craft into the \nproblem some aspect that does not go as planned. For example, a witness \ngets complete memory loss in the witness box, such as an arresting police \nofficer who suddenly has no recollection of where she was on the date of \nthe robbery; a witness tells a tale in the witness box that is directly at odds \nwith an earlier statement; during cross-examination, a plaintiff's witness \nsuddenly admits prejudice against the defendant.120 \n(11) It is a challenge to develop assessment criteria. To avoid the subjective bias \ninherent in an assessment based exclusively on the students' performance, \nconsideration should be given to a written component. A variety of options \nare available in this regard, and ultimately the course objectives would \ndictate the subject matter and form of the written component. This \ncomponent might include, by way of example, (i) a research paper on a trial \nadvocacy-related topic; or (ii) the preparation of a trial notebook, which \nincludes a detailed memorandum setting out the student's theory of the \ncase, and how that theory will be incorporated into every phase of the \ntrial.121 \nThis is merely my attempt to suggest, in concrete terms and by way of example, \na highly practical course of solid academic content. There are, of course, many \nother ways to structure an innovative, intellectually demanding trial advocacy \n                                            \n120  Kenety 1991 J Leg Ed 266.

In the light of the formative state of the enterprise, emphasis in the \ndevelopment of a university trial advocacy programme should naturally be on \nflexibility and experimentation. \n4 Conclusion \nThe famous legal realist, judge and law professor at Yale Law School, Jerome \nFrank, stated: "Our leading law schools are still library-law schools, book-law \nschools. They are not, as they should be, lawyer-schools".122 In the United States \nand South Africa alike, law schools have long emphasised that their graduates \nshould be able to think like lawyers, and more recently, that they should be able \nto write like lawyers. It is, however, equally imperative that we teach them how to \nact like lawyers. \nI do not suggest that our university law schools, in an effort to conquer the new \nhorizon of trial advocacy, should sacrifice what only they can do well - provide the \nbasic introduction to analytical skills and the research function that contribute new \nknowledge and insights about law and society. In the inevitable press for priority \namong competing demands, the law school can neither ignore nor subordinate \nits primary tasks - the development of intellectual skills and the achievement of \nintellectual goals.123 \nLikewise, I do not suggest that the university law school should throw off its \ntraditional curriculum to plunge headlong into a trial-centered teaching process \nthat makes the teaching of trial advocacy the focal point. The teaching of \nplumbing is undoubtedly important in modern day Pericleans, but the practical \ncourses that seek to develop students\' skills at digging trenches and connecting \npipes should not allow such tuition to be the substantive pillar of the LLB \ncurriculum. An educational agenda that focuses on the practicalities of forensic \ntechnique but neglects the intellectual dimension of trial advocacy would be \npedagogically unwise.124 \nIt would be a mistake for a university trial advocacy course to uncritically embrace \ntrial advocacy training divorced from the ideological, social and historical context \nin which the adversary system has developed.125 Teaching trial advocacy apart \nfrom its legal context transforms lawyers\' litigation decisions into purely tactical \nones. This oversimplification would deprive law students of an opportunity to think \n                                            \n122  Kaufman 1974 ABA J 803. \n123  Levin 1965 Buff L Rev 391. \n124  Imwinkelried 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 739. \n125  Tigar 1990 Rev Litig 202. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  24 \ncritically about one of the central institutions in our legal system.126 Michael \nTigar127 warns: \nI tremble for my profession when I see it inundated by suggestions that advocacy \ncan be reduced to a series of formulae about lawyer behaviour, divorced from the \nmerits of one\'s case and the ideology of the adversary system. I tremble because \nsuch suggestions trivialize the role and social responsibility of lawyers and because \nthe great advocates of this and every other time in recorded history have been \nstudents of society and not carnival barkers. \nThus, in a university trial advocacy course, students should be given the \nopportunity to learn not only "how" to conduct a trial, but also "why" their newly \nacquired skills should be used in a certain way, and "what" effect the use of that \nskill could have. Through properly constructed case files, assignments and class \ndiscussions, students should be able to reflect on issues that go beyond the mere \nmastery of forensic skills.128 The challenge, therefore, is to institute, further \ndevelop and refine a trial advocacy course that suits both the educational \nobjectives of the university and the demands of the legal profession. \nAs I have argued in Part 1 of this contribution, the "theory/practice" or \n"education/training" dichotomy is a "silly and destructive fight".129 It reflects a \nfallacy that demands that things be seen in either/or terms.130 It is advanced by \n"anti-practice", theoretical scholars, because it serves their myopic educational \nagenda. All legal academics - whether they consider themselves "theoretical", \n"doctrinal" or "practical" scholars - are engaged in the same endeavour. Our \ncollective obligation is to prepare students for the "real world" by teaching them \nthe theories, doctrines and techniques that they will need. \nHowever, as legal academics our obligation runs much deeper: it is to challenge \naccepted theories, doctrines and techniques.131 While acknowledging that our \nstudents have a legitimate and compelling need to learn technique, we should \nnonetheless assert our belief that they have another compelling, if less visible \nneed - "to explore what their use of technique might do to them, to their clients, \nand to their society".132 As such, a university trial advocacy course would perform \na unique, necessary and irreplaceable function within the LLB curriculum.133 Trial \n                                            \n126  Tanford 1991 J Leg Ed 260. \n127  Tigar 1985 Ltitigation 62. \n128  McCrimmon 1994 Legal Educ Rev 19. \n129  Hegland 1982 J Leg Ed 86. \n130  Spiegel 1986 UCLA L Rev 594. \n131  Hegland 1982 J Leg Ed 86. \n132  Hegland 1982 J Leg Ed 85-86. \n133  Lubet 1990-1991 Notre Dame L Rev 731. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  25 \nadvocacy supplements and enriches traditional law study by giving it coherence \nwithin a practical, socially responsive framework.134 \nTrial advocacy consists of a set of skills that transcends the walls of the \ncourtroom. It is difficult to conceive of a practising lawyer who does not, in some \nway and at some time, utilise the skills of advocacy - fact analysis, legal \nintegration and persuasive speech - as taught in a university trial advocacy \ncourse. Even the technical "forensic skills" of trial advocacy, such as courtroom \netiquette and demeanour, learning how to phrase a question to elicit a favourable \nresponse, and making an effective oral presentation, transfer readily to a wide \nrange of applications within both the legal and the business worlds. Not only is \nthe teaching of trial advocacy as part of the LLB curriculum laudable in itself, but \nit can also be used to strengthen the comprehension and competence of students \nin substantive law courses. The trial advocacy teaching methodology forces \nstudents to think more about doctrine.135 \nI am cognisant of the magnitude of the undertaking that I propose. Increasing \npressures on university funding, and the resulting scarcity of law school resources \nare a reality. However, I do not subscribe to the "give-in" philosophy that simply \nrejects a university trial advocacy course on the basis of lack of funding. Funds \ncan be raised if you have a good programme on offer. \nMoreover, as I see it, legal academics and practitioners have a joint obligation to \nserve the system of justice. While the responsibility to inculcate in our students a \nbasic level of practice competence lies with the university law school, a \nsubstantial burden also rests on the profession to support us in fulfilling our \nobligation. The most obvious assistance is financial. Good trial advocacy \nprogrammes do cost a lot of money. Experienced trial lawyers and judges should \nalso be willing to give of their time and expertise as extraordinary lecturers. \nAn LLB course in trial advocacy is an "an idea whose time has come".136 Its \nimplementation is long overdue. It affords law students opportunities that would \nnot otherwise be available until they transition to actual practice. It will give our \nstudents a real feel for what it means to be a lawyer.137 Such a course would \nprovide our students with a practical and immediately usable skill upon graduation \n- the ability to deal with facts and people. \n                                            \n134  Tauro 1976 B U L Rev 642. \n135  Geraghty 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 699. \n136  Tauro 1976 B U L Rev 649. \n137  Geraghty 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 699. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  26 \nThe task is clear and the challenge is at hand. University law schools are not \ngraduating even minimally functionally able practitioners. The legal system, law \nstudents and society are being shortchanged.138 We must firmly reject any notion \nthat the status quo is good enough. As a learned and public profession, we have \na duty to set and enforce the highest standards of basic legal education, of ethical \nconduct, and of professional excellence. \nBibliography \nLiterature \nAllen 1990 Notre Dame L Rev \nAllen RJ "NITA and the University" 1990 Notre Dame L Rev 705-720 \nBennett and Feldman Reconstructing Reality in the Courtroom  \nBennett WL and Feldman MS Reconstructing Reality in the Courtroom: Justice \nand Judgment in American Culture (Tavistock Publications London 2014) \nBerger and Mitchell 1992 Am J Trial Advoc \nBerger MJ and Mitchell JB "Rethinking Advocacy Training" 1992 Am J Trial Advoc \n821-838 \nBrosnahan 1992-1993 Am J Trial Advoc \nBrosnahan JJ "Suggestions for Enriching the Teaching of Trial Advocacy" 19921993\nAm J Trial Advoc 193-211 \nBroun 1977 ABA J \nBroun KS "Teaching Advocacy the NITA Way" 1977 ABA J 1220-1223 \nBurger 1967-1968 Washburn L J \nBurger WE "Remarks on Trial Advocacy: A Proposition" 1967-1968 Washburn L \nJ 15-24 \nBurger 1980-1981 Fordham L Rev \nBurger WE "Some Further Reflections on the Problem of Adequacy of Trial \nCounsel" 1980-1981 Fordham L Rev 1-25 \nBurger 1980 Clev St L Rev \nBurger WE "The Role of the Law School in the Teaching of Legal Ethics and \nProfessional Responsibility" 1980 Clev St L Rev 377-395 \nBurns 1995 LCP \n                                            \n138  Pertnoy 1994 Mo L Rev 186. \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  27 \nBurns RP "Teaching the Basic Ethics Class through Simulation: The \nNorthwestern Program in Advocacy and Professionalism" 1995 LCP 37-50 \nCarlson 1989 Ga L Rev \nCarlson RL "Competency and Professionalism in Modern Litigation: The Role of \nLaw Schools" 1989 Ga L Rev 689-729 \nClare 1975-1976 St John\'s L Rev  \nClare Jr RL "Incompetency and the Responsibility of Courts and Law Schools" \n1975-1976 St John\'s L Rev 463-472 \nCramton 1982 J Leg Ed \nCramton RC "The Current State of the Law Curriculum" 1982 J Leg Ed 321-335 \nDevitt and Roland 1987 Wm Mitchell L Rev \nDevitt EJ and Roland HP "Why don\'t Law Schools Teach Law Students how to \nTry Lawsuits" 1987 Wm Mitchell L Rev 443-459 \nFrank 1947 Yale L J \nFrank J "A Plea for Lawyer-Schools" 1947 Yale L J 1303-1344 \nFrank Courts on Trial \nFrank J Courts on Trial: Myths and Reality of American Justice (Princeton \nUniversity Press Princeton 1949) \nFuller and Randall 1958 ABA J  \nFuller LL and Randall JD "Professional Responsibility: Report of the Joint \nConference" 1958 ABA J 1151-1162; 1216-1218 \nGeraghty 1990 Notre Dame L Rev  \nGeraghty TF "Teaching Trial Advocacy in the 90s and Beyond" 1990 Notre Dame \nL Rev 687-703 \nGianantonio 2012 Duq L Rev  \nGianantonio AM "The Practical Use of the Trial Advocacy Course in Today\'s \nLegal Education Curriculum" 2012 Duq L Rev 485-501 \nGravett (Part 1) 2017 PELJ  \nGravett WH "The Myth of Objectivity: Implicit Racial Bias and the Law (Part 1)" \n2017 PELJ 1-25 \nGravett (Part 2) 2017 PELJ  \nGravett WH "The Myth of Objectivity: Implicit Racial Bias and the Law (Part 2)" \n2017 PELJ 1-25 \n', 'WH GRAVETT PER / PELJ 2018 (21)  28 \nGravett 2017 SALJ \nGravett, WH "The Myth of Rationality: Cognitive Biases and Heuristics in Judicial \nDecision-Making" 2017 SALJ 53-79 \nHanrahan 2003 BYU Educ & L J  \nHanrahan JK "Truth in Action: Revitalizing Classical Rhetoric as a Tool for \nTeaching Oral Advocacy in American Law Schools" 2003 BYU Educ & L J 299337\nHegland 1982 J Leg Ed \nHegland K "Moral Dilemmas in Teaching Trial Advocacy" 1982 J Leg Ed 69-86 \nHunter 1996 Law Teacher \nHunter J "Teaching Plumbing with Periclean Ideals: Should it be Done?
