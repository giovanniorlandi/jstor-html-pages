Valuation of Individual \nInvestment-linked Policies. (The paper discussed at the Institute in January 1980). \nBODEN, D.E. and KINGSTON, T. D. The effect of Inflation on Pension Schemes and their funding: \nquestions whether it makes sense to fund in advance in the inflationary conditions prevalent in \nthe U.K. and U.S.A. in the post-war  period. Consideration is then given to how various methods \nof financing pension schemes cope with inflation. A new approach to post-retirement pension \nincreases is suggested The authors then propose a consistent method of valuing final salary \npension schemes which enables the actuary to use valuation assumptions which do not demand \nchoosing an absolute level of salary increases or rate of inflation. \nNote on The Norwegian Society of Actuariesâ€™ 75th anniversary. \n535 \n']</pre>
