        <pre>['Published November, 1921\nTHE INTERPRETATION OF WATER-REQUIREMENT DATA.1 \nR. s. VAILE.2 \nSome years ago the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station set forth \nthe principle that the proper unit for measuring the crop-producmg \npower of irrigation water is the crop produced per acre-inch of water \nrather than that produced per acre of land. Considerable data have \nbeen submitted by various Utah workers in which this unit is supposedly\nused in determining water requirements and duty of water.3 \nThe present writer feels that many of these data have been presented \nwith an emphasis that leads to erroneous, or at best only partially correct,\ndeductions and conclusions. Judging from the general form of \nthe publications above referred to, they are designed primarily for the \npractical farmer and are expected to point the way to actual field \npractice. For this reason, particularly, the present writer feels that \nthe data should be rearranged or the arrangement enlarged to include \na factor that so far has been largely overlooked. \nThe general statement that the acre-inch is the proper unit to use \nin measuring the crop-producing power of water is readily accepted, \nand its important bearing on farming operations should be urged on \nall irrigation farmers. In the determination of the yield per acre-inch \nof water applied, however, the starting point must be the expected dryfarm\nyield for the same crop on the same land. Only the increase in \nproduction above the usual unirrigated yield may be properly credited \nto the irrigation water. It is obvious that only in special cases will \nthis point be zero. The Utah publications have used zero as a starting \npoint in nearly all cases, or if they have considered the dry-farm value, \nit has not been given proper weight in their tables· and conclusions. \nFortunately, the published data give opportunity, in nearly every case, \nfor a rearrangement on the basis of increase over dry-farm yields \nbrought about by irrigation. \nThe present writer desires to submit the following proposition: " In \nfiguring the comparative crop-producing power of a definite amount \n1 Paper No. 73, University of California, Graduate School of Tropical Agriculture\nand Citrus Experiment Station, Riverside, Cal. Received for publica-\ntion December 13, 1920. \n2 Assistant professor of orchard management. \n3 Note particularly Utah Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin IIS, II6, \nII7, II8, I19, 146, and 157. \n311 \n', '3I2 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRON,lMY. \nof irrigation water when used on various units of land, the same total \narea of land must always be considered and the dry-farm yield credited \nto any portion not irrigated by reason of increased application to other \nportions." In other words, if the crop-producing power of 30 acreinches\nof water is being considered when all applied to I acre as com-\npared to an application of s acre-inches to each of 6 ~cres, then it is \nonly fair in the former case to credit the total yield with the expected \nyield of S acres dry farmed. To illustrate, if 30 acre-inches of irrigation\nwater are distributed s inches deep over 6 acres and result in a \nyield of 6o bushels per acre, the total result for irrigation, as expressed \nby the Utah writers, would be 360 bushels. If, on the other hand, the \n30 acre-inches were all used on one acre and the yield should be I so \nbushels for that I acre, then the Utah writers would form a comparison \nbetween 360 and I so and conclude that it would be better irrigation \neconomy to use the water distributed on all the Janel. Suppose, however,\nthat this same land is capable of producing so bushels per acre \nwithout irrigation, S acres would then produce 2SO bushels. This \nadded to the I so bush~ls produced on the I acre irrigated with the \n30 acre-inches gives a total yield from the 6 acres of 400 bushels, or \nan increase of 40 bushels over the method of broader distribution of \nthe water. This, the present writer believes, is the fairer basis of \ncomparison. In applying the above method of comparing results to \nthe data submitted in the Utah reports; several suggested conclusions \nare modified, at least in detail. The following typical examples are \nsubmitted: ., \nI. The crop-producing power of 30 acre-inches when applied to \ndifferent areas of land cropped to corn is shown in Bulletin II7, Table \nIO, to be 97.I2 bushels wh~n applied to I acre, 187.86 bushels when \nspread over 2 acres, 268.s6 bushels on 3 acres, and 3I6.s6 bushels on \n4 acres. \nBut the dry-farm yield has been forgotten! On page 8S it is stated \nto be <4}.76 bushels per acre. Allowing for this yield on a sufficient \narea to complete the 4 acres of land cropped in each c;,1.se, the figures \njust cited are converted into the following: \nI acre irrigated, 3 acres dry farmed, \n2 acres irrigated, 2 acres dry farmed, \n3 ·acres irrigated, I acre dry farmed, \n4 acres irrigated, \ntotal yield, 228.40 bushels. \ntotal yield, 275.40 bushels. \ntotal yield, 312.32 bushels. \ntotal yield, 316.56 bushels. \nIn this case the conclusion that the 30 acre-inches may most economically\nbe distributed over 4 acres is possibly still tenable, altho the \nmargin of difference is very small and might not be sufficient to war-\n', 'VAILE: WATER-REQUIREMENT DATA. \nrant the extra expense involved in the irrigation of the larger area. \nThe arrangement of the data as originally submitted, on the other hand, \nseemed to indicate an unquestioned superiority in favor of the distribution\nover the entire area. \n2. In Bulletin I I6, Table 5, the following figures occur: \nPercentage of crop weight due to rain and soil water as compared \nto 7·5 acre-inches of irrigation water: Wheat, 86 percent; corn, 8o percent;\npotatoes, 67 percent. Using these figures with the data pre-\nsented in Table 6 for the yield with 7·5 acre-inches of irrigation, the \nfollowing expected dry-farm yields of dry matter are obtained: ·wheat, \n4,888 pounds-; corn, 8,6IS pounds; and potatoes, I,829 pounds. \nIf units of 50 acre-inches of water and IO acres of land are used, \nTABLE I.-Results obtained from 50 acre-inches of irrigation U:,ater used 111 \nvarying amounts on all or part of IO acres of 1vheat, corn and Potatoes, \nwith the balance of the IO acres dry fanned in each case. \nWHEAT. \nI I Yield of dry Yield of dry I Yield of dry matter per acre\'matter\nper acre.

The choice \nof these particular units is, of course, entirely arbitrary, except that \nthe proportion .between acre-inches and acres of land is such that the \nentire tract will just be covered by the smallest irrigation application \nused in the experiments. \nThe striking thing brought out by the above figures is the difference \nin ratio between the amounts of dry matter produced by a given amount \nof irrigation water when used in various ways, as determined by the \ntwo methods of comparison. This difference depends upon whether \nthe unit of land used for the total yield is kept constant by including \nthe dry-farm yield on the unirrigated portions, or whether the unit of \nland cropped is changed to correspond only to the amount covered \nwith irrigation water. It seems to the present writer that the latter \nmethod (which is the one used by the Utah authors) is open to criticism\nin that· it introduces so obvious a variable in the extent and value \nof the original plant as well as in the labor outlay. It is even further \nat fault in that it does not give sufficient weight to the rain and soil \nmoisture, for in the case of the distribution of the irrigation water over \nthe IO acres the amount of water furnished by nature is not limited to \nI3.74 acre-inches (the figure used in case of wheat), but becomes ten \ntimes that amount. \n3· In Bulletin I46 of the Utah station the following statement occurs:\n"The total yield (produced by natural soil moisture and 20 inches \nof irrigation water) was more than three times as much when the 20 \nacre-inches were used on 4 acres as where the water was all applied \nto I acre" (p. 25). The obvious implication would seem to be that it \nwere decidedly better irrigation economy to spread the 20 acre-inches \nover the 4 acres. However, in case all the water is used on I acre, \nthe other 3 acres are forgotten in arriving at this conclusion, altho the \ncomplete data of yields as listed on page 30 show a considerable dryfarm\npossibility for them. Utilizing the data presented on page 3o, \nTable 2 has been compiled. \nFrom Table 2 it becomes evident that the distribution of the 20 \nacre-inches over the 4 acres is very little better than the use of the \nentire amQtmt on I acre, with the other 3 acres dry farmed. In fact, · \nthe difference indicated is not greater than the experimental error that \nis to be expected in such field trials. In this case, the conclusion stated \nby the authors of the bulletin, namely, that the best practice seems to \nbe to irrigate with IS acre-inches divided into three applications, still \nholds. In the next example the soundness of the authors\' deductions \ndoes not seem so clear. \n', 'VAILE: WATER-REQUIREMENT DATA. \nTABLE 2.-Yields of wheat obtained from 20 acre-inches of irrig~!lion water \nused in var)•ing ammwts on all or part of 4 acres, with the \nbalance of the 4 acres dry farmed. \nAcres.

The author has evidently forgotten for the \nmoment his oft-repeated slogan that the unit of measure for irrigation \neconomy should be the a"cre-inch of water rather than the acre of land. \nFor the purpose of compiling a comparative table. from the data submitted\nin the above bulletin, the present writer has taken the arbitrary \nunits of 45 acre-inches of irrigation water to be used on all or any \npart of 9 acres of land planted to potatoes. (The reason for using this \nproportion between land and water is again found in the fact that it just \naccommodates the smallest quantity Of water used in the experiments, \nwhen distributed over the entire area.)

It is genera)ly held that the margin of financial profit increases\nwith tli.e increase in yield per acre, only up to some fixed point; \n', '3I6 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY. \nit is commonly recognized that dry-farm crops have a greater value \nthan the same weight or\' bulk of irrigated crops, because of superior \nquality; there is a varying labor cost in the application of irrigation \nwater, dependent in part upon whether a given amount of water is \ndistributed over a limited or extended area; in certain cases the dryfarm\nyield can not be produced at a financially profitable figure; all \nthese and many other considerations must be in the farmer\'s mind \nbefore he determines just what system will give the greatest economy \nin water usage on his particular farm. The present writer feels, however,\nthat the method of figuring water duty suggested above has much \nto commend i.t to the practical operator and is less likely to be misleading\nthan the method used in the publications reviewed. \nAll of the above tabulations or illustrations are designed to show the \nreasonableness of the proposition stated at the beginning. For sake \nof clearness, let us restate it in conclusion : " Given a farm of definite \narea and a definite amount of available irrigatiop water;\' given, further, \nthe possibility of producing profitable· crops under a system of dry \nfarming; then, in case the irrigated area is decreased by increasing the \nacre application of a part of the farm, it is not fair to assume that the \ntotal area cropped will be reduced, but rather that the land released \nfrom irrigation will still maintain its dry-farming value." There is \nnothing in this proposition that in any way interferes with the principle \nthat the acre-inch of water should be used as a unit in measuring \nwater economy, but it merely suggests a method of utilizing that unit \nfairly.· \n']</pre>
