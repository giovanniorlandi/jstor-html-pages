The question is prompted, by statements made in the Garland, case, now agitating supposedly staid, New England. The story is one of, wealth, soulmates and philosophy., "Every time you assume some one, else’s responsibilities you take that, much out of your own life, and out, of the other person’s that is essen, tial t-o your own, or to his own. de, velopment.", So much for the newer and freer, love, as lived and preached by Charles, Garland, of North Carver, Mass., the, youth who once rejected a fortune of a, million, but finally accepted it to give, away., Garland is not interested in accumu, lating dollars. The personal equation, diverts him more, and in it he finds, adventure not to be equalled by the, hoarding or spending of wealth., Because of his insistence upon liv, ing as he thinks best Mrs. Charles, Garland, who was Mary Wrenn, has, Get thrice-daily benefit from, this low-cost aid to, Makes your, smokes, k taste, better, The Flavor Lasts, I left her idealistic husband. Is she, • selfish to leave, or is the blame to lie, ! placed elsewhere,?, ! GARLAND’S FEMININE TRIANGLE, Miss Lillian Conrad, Boston art stu, dent and once secretary to Garland’s, mother, is the chief cause of marital, discord. With her Garland lived for, I some time and will live again, he, says., Miss Doris Benson is another young, i person who has “problems of her, i own.” To work them out she will try, to breathe the rarefied atmosphere, | that surrounds Garland by moving to, | a nearby farm. With Miss Benson, I Garland’s relations have been merely, I friendly, not intimate, as in the ease, i of Miss Conrad., i To his wife the idea of sharing the, | millionaire idealist with another wom, an is abhorrent. So she left him. Prob, ably her eccentric husband would sav, she takes life too seriously., ] Marriage contracts are but empti, \\ ness. Garland says he has found out, i in the last few years. Every sen, j fence of the ceremony is replete with, I hypocrisy —• and of all poor human, promises the one which pledges to, forever love and cherish is the most, misleading., No man or woman, he contends,, can make such promise, since it is, not within the mind\'s power to fore, tell what the heart will do ., SOON EXPECTS CHILD, Mary Wrenn Garland (how life-like, her own simple name sounds?) has, one child and expects soon to become, a mother again., What must she think of it all? The, re.fusal of her mate to accept a mil, lion-dollar estate, liis denial of the, value of money, any money; and his, attachment to an amazing young wo, man who says she asks nothing from, him except his companionship; and, his platonic friendship for another girl, who finds it necessary to live near, him., Kor some one all mis rant oi iree,, dom and soul sympathies and throw, ing away money must be heartrend, ing., This man who shuns responsibili, ties seems to be putting himself in, the way of securing a great many of, them. Hear his defense:, “Lillian (Miss Conrad) has consid, ered what it would mean for her to, mine to live with me, and that is her, business., “I want you to understand that we, are not turning our backs on conse, quences and probabilities when we, take the step we do. We have consid, ered what may happen and are pre, partd to face our problems when they, come up. I cannot te.ll you what I, would do, hut feel that I can find the, solution if the occasion arises., “HYPOCRISY FOR ME", “I don’t say that the marriage cer, emony is a hypocrisy for everyone,, but it would he for me. Every line, of it, more or less, contains an under, lying hypocrisy, hut the, promise to, love and chorish is the most deceitful,, ! It is not within a man’s power to, promise to love and cherish, because, hie emotions are not within the con, trol of his intellect., “And it is hypocrisy to say that it, Is God’s will that two people should be, united just because some man reads, the marriage service to them., "From the legal point of view mar, riage must have some temporal value, It has no lasting value. I think the, time will come wheat all laws and, conventions will be abolished. They, will be abolished when people become, self-respecting.”, What- is new about that? Simply a, doctrine of selfishness, and goodness, knows that unpleasant human quality, has no novelty about it., And what has Miss Conrad to say, for herself?, “LOVE HIM FOR IDEAL”, "I love him for his ideals, not for, the man himself,” she states., “I will sacrifice my love at any mo, ment for those ideals. I know that, Mary Wrenn Garland, Charles’s wife,, , looks on me as a thief, a vampire who, has stolen her husband. She has, denounced me to my face as a traitor.”, | This strange girl can find hoppiness, in an intimate relation with Garland, : at a time when his wife is expecting, ■ another child. And to add insult to, j injury, she says:, "I pity Mrs. Garland.”, : Pity is one form of contempt. But, I Mrs. Garland is not to be pitied., People who are apt to feel this emo, j tion for her had better save it for, j Miss Conrad and Miss Benson, who, I are searching for the “Bluebird” and, seem to have found nothing better, ! than a Bluebeard., “My first duty is to Charles,” con, j tinues Miss Conrad, and one is sur, prised that the word “duty” is in her, | 100-per-cent-for-freedom vocabulary!, “FREE TO GO BACK”, j “Charles is free to go back to his, I first wife, whom he still loves. He is, : free to go to any other woman, even, ! as he came to me. I will share him, | with anyone else,, or I will give him, \\ up forever.", None of these, woman, wire or, 1 sweetheart or platonic friend, seems, to feel that money means much in, her young life. Mrs. Garland, as, ! mothers will, may feel that it would, he nice for her husband to provide, for his children, and it is said that a, ! settlement has been made for them., Does Lillian Conrad care what any, one, thinks? She does not, thank you, I just the same! She says:, “I do not live according to the, standards of the world, and therefore, j 1 do not care what the world thinks.”, That’s all very well as long as, Miss Conrad is the heroine of the, unusual affair. But she may not al, ways play that stellar role. Like Mrs., Garland, she may be supplanted,, j Charles says so himself. Miss Con, ! rad has returned to her art school at, Boston temporarily to meditate af, fairs., Plain sewing, mending, darning and, coats relined.

He is strongly for the removal, of every lock, bar, fence or wall around the, remaining national domain; he wants to take, the gates down and throw them away, remove, even the hinges so that access to public prop, erty may be free and unimpeded. And Secre, tary Fall as a starter wants the resources of, Alaska placed under his care that they may, be properly “unlocked.” More especially does, he want the Alaskan National Forests taken, from the Department ,of Agriculture and, turned over to him, presumably to make the, timber “easy of access.”, Is it necessary to repeat what the policy of, the give-away-tionists did to the national j, timber wealth, to the industries depending I, upon tins timber. Is it necessary to point out j, that 80,000,000 acres of erstwhile forest, land, capable of producing an excellent stand of, timber under right management, lies absolut, ly unproductive and worthless while the tim, ber users in its vicinity have to pay freight, on lumber hauled from districts thousands of, miles away? That condition is the result of, allowing the bulk of the nation’s forests pass\', into private hands without restriction as to -, use., j, Tt Fall instead of Roosevelt had been in pow, er seventeen years ago, the bulk of Alaska’s, timber lands would now be locked up in pri, vate hands; sooner or later this timber would, bo cut and devastation left in its place just, as was done in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Mich, iiran, in New England, in the South and the, Far West., Of course any use is better than no use at, all. But has no use been made of Alaska’s, timer during- the last seventeen years?—Run, set Magazine., The above may be sound reasoning, but the, fact remains that the “unlocking” idea ap, peals strongly to the majority of Alaskans,, who agree that there ras already been too, much conservation of the natural resources of, the Territory. However, the present policy, of the Forestry control seems to be sufficiently, liberal but at the same time thei\'e is no occas, ion for believing that Secretary Fall wants, to loot the forest of Alaska or anything else., To the closing question of the above. “Has no, use been made of Alaska’s timber during the, past seventeen years?” we can truthfully an, swer, “Dum little.”—Strollers Weekly, .Tun, eau., THE WASTE OF LUXURY, Figures are peculiar things. Sadly trite and, meaningless in the abstract, in the concrete, they become amazing things., Dr. P. P. Claxton, for many years Federal, Commissioner of Education, says that during, one year we spend more for luxeries than has, been spent for education during the entire, history of the country. During 1918, the last, year for which complete records are available,, a total of $919,729,258 was spent for schools, and colleges in all grades. During 1920 two, items on our luxury bill cosmetics and soft, drinks, amounted to $1,100,000,000, while the, total luxury account for 1920 footed up $22,, 700,000,000. Dr. Claxton estimates that only, $16,645,000,000 has been spent on public educa, tion since the founding of the republic., Federal tax returns have been put to curious, use in connection with the problems now be, fore the Conference for the Limitation of, Armament. Statisticians have been verv ac, *, tive in bringing out the relative figures as, to military expenditures and the amount, spent by the people for minor luxuries., The amount spent for the army in 1921 is, estimated at $418,999,999. During the same, year the country consumed $85,000,000 in can, dy and chewing gum, while tobacco in its var, ious forms required $1,151,000,000., Modern civilization has some queer prob, lems to solve if it is going to attempt to el, iminate waste from the budget of the common, good., BATS, The National Board of Underwriters, hav, ing under consideration the various sources, of danger from conflagration, has been giving, careful attention to the question of rats. It, is a subject to which the average thoughtful, citizen has probably never given more than, passing thought. Perhaps, after all, it is a, question largely for the fire insurance people, to consider; but out of it there have come some, peculiar facts in regard to the cost of rats, at large., An economic authority has discovered that, in common with the cost of living the upkeep, of our rats has soared to unprecedented hights., Ten years ago it was estimated that simply, cost us <.t, the rate of $1.80 per person to sup, port the rats of the United States. We are, told notv that it has reached a trifle over $7, per person. In other words, more than $759,, 000,000 worth of foodstuffs every year is con, sumed or destroyed by these ever-present den, izens of -cellars and walls and garrets. This is, regardless of the fact that medical science has, demonstrated that the ubiquitous rodent is, the carrier of certain serious diseases, among, them the terrible Bubenic Plague, and that, the crossed wires and spontaneous combustion, that are credited with millions of dollars of, fire loss are probably largely attributable to, the reckless habits of this vermin.\', There are a good many things aside from, ethics and art with which the confer piativc, mind may concern itself., HOMEY PHILOSOPHY FOR 1922, Sometimes we like to philosophize about our, selves. Just now, for instance, we finish peer, ing out of tlu> window, wondering about all, the good folks who all the time are so anxious, we should help them; and then we started to, conjure up a picture of all the folks we have, tried to help in the old home town, and we had, to stop—we couldn’t get the picture on our, mental film. So now we are at the typewrit, er, wondering how so many folks don’t see that, to help them we must be strong enough to help, —wondering if they know anything about this, Put and Take business. We can’t take some, thing out of the bank if we never pat any, thing into it, can we? Ask the farmer., _, THINGS WE THINK ji, THINGS OTHERS THINK AND WHAT WE THINK !, OF THE THINGS OTHERS THINK, I.__I, Truth is stranger than some fiction, but it isn’t strang, er than the excuses that some husbands give for late, hours., * * •, Time won’t turn backward for anybody in its flight,, which is a mighty good thing for a lot of folks with a, past., * * • I, There is a “talking automible” on the market.

This is an outdoors land. No, Alaskan should feel ill at c^se with, a rifle in his hand. He should be, able to shoot straight and hit the, mark. The Rifle Club furnishes him, with all that is necessary to do this, at a minimum of cost. It provides, keen competition in its weekly shoots, and lias an outdoor and indoor range., * * V, So it goes. Our Town affords an, opportunity for each of ns to get in, to something which appeals, outside, of the mere business of working, eat, ing. and sleeping. We don\'t want to, become one-sided. Get us have some, outside interests. Hobbies have kept, people out of the insane asylum here, tofore. Get in and join up. Put, your shoulder to the wheel in some, of these organizations, and help keep, them moving. Tt more than repays, for the effort invovled., » • *, The chief feature of the present, winter season of Cordova has been, the more than usual gathering to, gether of congenial spirits into clubs, and organizations. Cordova has al, ways had its full share of the fra, ternities with the Masons, Eagles,, Pioneers, K. of P’s, Eastern Star,, etc. In addition the various church, es have their societies, Ladies Aid,, Guild, Alter Society, and others. This, does "not account for several inform, al bridge clubs and like sort. Then, there is the Northland Club and the, Rills’ Club, more pretentious in their, imaginings and activities, and main, taining special quarters for their, members. Roth of the latter occupy, an important place in the social life, of Our Town., Not content with this formiable ar, ray of testimony to the gregarious, ness of mankind, Our Folks have, branched out into still further clubs., The organization of some has already, been effected, whilo still others are, in the formative stage, and some few, only projected., * • *, Of the new cluhs, the most ac, tive, (quite naturally) has been the, Athletic Club. Maintaining its own, quarters in the Eagle’s Hall, this, club has preformed a useful and, meritorious public service in pro, viding Intelligent, clean, and whole, some entertainment for the younger, folks among us. Most of us were ag, reeably surprised a week ago to see, what the hoys could do. when the, Northland Arrows ran circles around, the hoys from Fort Liseum in the, basket ball game. There are further, fields of usefulness open to the Ath, letic Club, which those among us, who, have the best interests of real sport, at heart, earnestly hope the members, will embrace. Chief among these Is, baseball. Cordova has had a base, ball team for several years. Its, team has been a credit to the town, deserving of support and encourage, ment. It has been suggested that, the Athletic Club Is the proper body, for financing of the baseball team. The, team this year should have an en, tire new outfit of uniforms, and par, aphernalia. This will take a little, money but not much. The public of, Cordova has ever been generous to, the team, and will continue to be so., [f the Athletic Club should under, take to stand sponser for the team,, and stage one or two atfatrs solely, lor the purpose of supplying the boys, some one to take the initiative. Here, is an opportunity for real service., We take pride in being an American, city. As such we must have a base, ball team, and we can afford to, properly equip the boys who have al, ways been so generous of their time, with the necessary outfit, the results, would be assured. All it needs is, ! and enthusiasm, and have afforded, ■ so much real pleasure to the pub, lic in the pears gone by. Let’s all, get together on behalf of the team, and start something to get them what, they ne?d., • • •, “Now Is the time, the walrus said,, to think of many things,, Of shoes, and ships, and sealing, wax, of cabbages, and kings.”, • Cordovans are not entirely inter, ested in the physical side of life., The other part of man is not being, neglected. Witness the organization, last week by a group of Our Folks,, who have passed the basketball age, but have reached the time of life, when the intellectual pleasures have, the greatest appeal, of a Literary, Club. There promises to be as much, interest and enthusiam shown by, these older folk in their literary, rarnblings, as their younger brothers, take in shooting a basket from a, difficult angle. The program as so, far outlined promises that, there will, be no dull moments during the club, meetings. The first book to be di, gested, and the club will read only, such books as deserve to be chewed, and digested, is the Autobiography, rf Rpnjamin Franklin. Then comes, Motley\'s “The Rise of the Dutch, Republic.” and later “The diary of, Samuel Repys." There will be some, excursions into "Plato and Plutarch’s, l ives.” A short portion of every ss, s\'on will be devoted to poetry, and, here the members are to be free to, ramble where theid individual tenden, cies will take them. The gentle, .iourneyings of the club members, through the rich valleys and on the, snlendid mountain tops of literature, promise some hours of rare enjoy, ment., * * *, Among the projected organizations, which are being considered, one, i which the town really needs is a Ski, 1 Club. We have in Cordova some, splendid devotees of this sport, men, who learned the game in Norway and, Switzerland, and love it for its own, sake. The rise of this sport in pub, lic esteem during the last few years, has been enormous, its popularity, has grown by leaps and bounds, and, deservedly so. In Alaska, with its, long winters, and especially in the, coastal area, which experiences no, untoward rigors of weather, the con, ditions are good for the enjoyment of, skiing. It is like golf, suitable for, any age, for one can make it as, strenuous as one pleases. It has, however many advantages over golf,, both from the standpoint of pleasure, and of exercise. It is believed that, a properly organized Ski Club would, give great impetus to the interest in, the ;sport.

SMITH, Cordova, HAVE W DAYS’ COAL SUPPLY, AS NATIONAL STRIKE NEARS, Operator Says Walkout Would Cut Out, put Fifty Per Cent, NEW YORK, Feb. 11.—A coal Btrike, at the termination of the existing con, tract between operators and miners, on March 31 would have no immediate, effect on the nation, according to, Thomas H. Watkins, president of the, Pennsylvania Coal and Coke Corpora, tion and regarded as one of the best, operators in the bituminous coal in, dustry., Asked today how the production of, the country would be affected in the, event of a strike, he answered., "In some districts not at all. In, the, non-union districts a. substantial, increase in production would follow, a strike in the union field and the, production of the country as a whole, would be cut from 40 to 50 per cent., "There would be no immediate ef, fect, as the stocks in hands of con, sumers cover at least ninety days’ sup, ply at the present rate of consump, tion., “Increased development now going, on in the non-union districts natur, ally tends to reduce production from, the union districts, und this is likely, to be still more pronounced in 1922., CONSUMPTION 65 PER CENT, “It should be borne in mind that, the country\'s consumptive demand to, day is about 65 per cent of the great, est known maximum production.’’, Watkins declared ’“the operators are, not profiteering” and cannot afford in, creased wages to the miners., “The margins of profit have in many, cases been totally eliminated in the, last few months.”, I "In what manner could the ultimate!, | price of soft coal to the consumer, be reduced?" he was asked., "Reduction of wages, reduction of, freight rates, reduction in the cost, j of distribution,” was the answer., The consumer would get the bene, \' fit of whatever reductions were made, in freight rates or wages, Watkins de, clared., “The demands of the operators, when the present contract with the, soft coal miners expires on March 31, have not yet been formulated, but, presumably will ask for a rate of, wages that will allow the meeting of, competition from the non-union oper, ations,” Watkins continued., “CANNOT SAFELY IGNORE”, j “The union operator is controlled, j by general economic and competitive, j conditions and cannot safely ignore, the laws of supply and demand, eith, er in the labor or commodity mar, kets.”, The non-union mines of the country, are producing an increasingly large, percentage of the total coal output,, according to Watkins., "For instance, in Pennsylvania for, the year 1921 the production of the, union mines fell to about 43 per cent, of the total production, while in 1920, it was 54 per cent of the total,” he, said., The variations between the union, miners\' wage scale and that of the, non-union miners run from 30 to 50, per cent in different districts, accord, ing to Watkins., GIRLS TOLD TO, DRESS BY OWN, CONSCIENCE, EVANSTON. 111., Feb. 10.—Girls,, in deciding what to wear and what, not to wear, let conscience be your, only guide., Tnls is tne aovice oi a lenrueu, judge—Justice of the Peace Max, Witkower, of this sedate little town,, whose judicial duties have been such, as to warrant the statement that, what he says on the subject can be, accepted as authoritative.

Eliza, beth “dolled herself up” in her moth, er’s silk stockings roled beneath her, knees, a tucked-up skirt which de, layed dimpled knees; powder and, rouge, perhaps applies a little too, thickly, and her brother’s low rub, ber boots, in lieu of galoshes., Elizabeth crossed the yard to test, her get-up on Homer Anderson an, interior decorator., Mr. Anderson’s decorative sense, was outraged. His remarks shocked, Elizabeth, who returned home cry, ing. Her father hurried to Ander, son\'s presence for an explanation.
