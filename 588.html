There is said to be a\nfjuiet movement among the House In\nsurgents to make Mr. Edward A.\nHaye, Representative from California\nSneaker. Of course it will not be done\ntoo hastily. Tne hisurgenis are too\ngood politician- and strategists to\nforce tilings too often, but if when the\nnext eruption comes, you should see\nMr. Hayes name in six-inch letters on\nthe first paire of your daily iwpr, do\nnot be surprised. There Is not a man\nin Congress who has fallen into and\nout of inaargency more frequently\nthan K. A. Hayes, and each time ihe\nhas emerged with something he did\nnot hifve lefore. That\'s the Wiscon\nsin style HTi-ynow and Hayes was\nborn in Chat state back In 1855. He\ndid the public school tour thoroughly\nat Waterloo, and then entered the\nl\'nlversity of Wisconsin, from which\nhe eaierged witu a \'hack load of de\ngrees in J&79. A few years later he\nloiuid tiiat law plus iron mines was\nmore profitable than plain law and\nlately he has been almost forgotten\nby his brethren of tne calf-bound folio.\nIn 1887 \'he removed to California,\nbought a bunnh of fruit plantations\nand a neat little package of mines,\nand went into business in California\non the Wisconsin plan, which he has\nproved fairly efficient.\nLest sooie one say something a.bout\nhi.n that he couldn\'t reply to properly\nhe also went nto the newspaper bus\niness in San Jose, where he now lives.\nand between writing a bit, appearing\nnow and then in the courts, and rais\ning the long yell whenever he sees\nsomeone get on his congressional pre\nserves, he Vas managed to keep fairly\nbusy. His district is a fairly close\none, and if he didn\'t cultivate a minor\nparty or two in his political planta\ntion there mieht come a time when\nhe would be left in the cold. Howev\ner, he does cultivate them, and as\nCalifornia is on prmeiple ag\'in tne\ngovernment anyhoiw, (his seat ought\nto be reasonably secure for some time\nto come.\nBut this getting away from that,\nmatter of the insurgent caucas. Mr.\nHayes Is fmsy\' in that matter as an\nant on a -hot rock and there is som\nreasonable certitude in the prediction\nthat -whoever loses, -Red" Hayes\nwon\'t.
