        <pre>['[TheLog Cabin Democrat., DAILY EDITION, VOL. 2 NO. 22 ■ CONWAY, ARKANSAS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1909 TEN CENTS PER WEEK, FAULKNER COUNTY FAIR IS, A SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE, Highly Commended by Hundreds of Visitors From All, Over Arkansas and Other States., BABY SHOW YESTERDAY AN INTERESTING FEATURE, Ninety-Two Faulkner County Baby Boys and Girls Entered, in Contest, Nineteen of fhem Receiving, Handsome Prizes., Business has resume <1 its normal, status in Conway again, following the, close last night of the most success, ful event ever held here, the first an, nual Faulkner county fair. Although, two-thirds of the midway shows had, departed for the state fair, there was, another big crowd out last night to, witness the final fireworks display., During this show Ben L. Griffin, on, behalf of the fair association, pub, licly thanked the Layton Amusement, Company and M. B. Pletz, who put, on the fireworks and other side attrac, tions, for the splendid amusement they, had given the people, and at his sug, gestion the crowd in the grandstand, rose to their feet to express their ap, preciation., That there is a distinct and definite, demand for a county fair; that the, first effort was a decided success, and, that it will become an annual event,, is the opinion of everyone in any way, connected with the fair. Plans for next, year’s fair are already being discussed, and there is every reason why a still, better fair can be given after the ex, perience already gained., A most remarkable feature of the, whole event was the absolute lack of, any disorder or unpleasantness at any, time. The big crowd was full of fun, and everybody seemed to be thorough, ly enjoying themselves and there was, not the slightest indication of any de, sire to break either the rules of the, fair or the laws of the state. In ad, dition to this, with big crowds packed, together, sometimes so tightly that it, was impossible for one to move, there, * was not an accident or any injury, worthy of mention. Finally, with four, days of perfect, cloudless weather and, pleasant temperature, the fair asso, ciation was certainly fortunate in, every respect., THE BABY SHOW., Ninety-two babies ranging in age, from one to 24 months, and every one, of them worthy of a prize, were en, tered in the baby show, which was the, feature event on the closing afternoon, of the county fair. That the five, judges succeeded in selecting from, this array of infantile beauty 19 prize, winners and escaped even without the, loss of a hair is an event equally as, remarkable as the unexpectedly large, number of entries., The babies were divided into classes,, first and second prizes being given in, each class, and in addition there was, a prize for the best twins and a grand, prize for the prettiest and best baby, of any age in the show. The last, named prize was a pretty diamond, ring, given by Governor Donaghey., The grand prize was won by Chris, topher Thurman -Johnston, the 21, months-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Wal, ter Johnston, who make their home, with (\'. A. Simmons and family, in, the southern part of this city. They, moved here only about three months, ago from Heber, and there are today, no prouder parents in the United, States than Mr. and Mrs. Johnston., The handsome little boy received two, prizes, the first prize in the class in, which he was entered, IS tv 24 months,, and the diamond ring, and his mother, received an elegant five-pound box of j, candy, presented by Caspar Dum., The judges in the contest were Ben, I„ Griffin, J.

The real estate assessment for, 1909 is $15,333,970, against $10,754,, 455 for 1908, the increase being $4,, 579,515.

A. Lea disallowed the claim against, the county for the costs in the case of, the state against L. E. Millegan,, amounting to $518.75. Millegan was, convicted of murder in the second de, gree for killing J. Herring, and sen, tenced to 10 years in the penitentiary,, and the costs accrued during the trial, of this case. Judge Lea explained his, action by stating that the law makes, the defendant liable for the costs when, he is convicted of a crime and renders, any property in his possession at the, time of his arrest subject to execution, for the costs. In this case Circuit, Clerk Ledbetter issued an execution, for the costs, but it was returned by, Sheriff Brady with the endorsement, that no property was found. Judge, Lea states that Millegan executed a, mortgage after his arrest for two, mules, a horse, a buggy and a wagon,, and says that this property is liable, for the costs and has instructed Sher, iff Brady to take possession of it., 11,623, is the lucky number, We desire to acknowledge our ap, preciation of the many compliments, passed upon our exhibit at the great, Faulkner county fair.

F. Davenport of this city, who, held a ticket bearing the number 3455., Each person buying a ticket to the, fail\' was given a stub bearing the, same number as his ticket, and the, tickets were deposited in a box. Be, fore a big and interested crowd in the, grandstand late yesterday afternoon, the drawing was had. Two numbers, were drawn and called out without, anyone presenting the duplicate stub,, but when the third number was called, Mrs. Davenport announced that she, held the correct number., The fair association advertised that, it would redeem the mule for $125, and, Mrs. Davenport accepted this alterna, tive. At the Faulkner County Bank, this morning she was paid six $20 and, one $5 gold pieces., DONAGHEY TO MEET TAFT., Little Rock.

These, hills are really mountains that are al, most worn out, for they are the old, est land In America, and, according, to Agassiz, the oldest in the world., In tht days when there was nothing, but water on the face of the globe,, these mountains came up—a long is, land of primitive rock with universal, ocean chating against its shores. None, of the other continents had put in, their appearance at the time America, was thus looking up. The United, States began to come to light by the, gradual uplifting of this land to the, north and the appearance of the tops, of the Alleghenies which were next, In order. Later the Rockies started, up The United States grew south, ward from Wisconsin and westward, from the Blue Ridge. An early view, of the country would have shewed a, large Island which is now northern, Wisconsin, and a long thin tongue of, this primitive rock sticking down from, Canada into Minnesota, and these two, glowing states looking out over the, valers at the mere beginnings of, mountain ranges east and west. They, were waiting for the rest of the Unit, ed Stales to appear.—The Atlantic, HUMOR BURNED AND ITCHED., Eczema on Hand, Arm*, Legs and, Face—It Was Something Terrible., Complete Cure by Cuticur*., "About fifteen or eighteen years, ago eczema developed on top of my, hand.

I went to another doctor who, nad the reputation of being the best, m town. He told me it was eczema., Ills medicine checked the advance of, the disease, but no further. I finally, concluded to try the Cutlcura Reme, dies and found relief in the first trial., I continued until I was completely, cured from the disease, and I have, not been troubled since. C.

It has not been, swallowed up in an earthquake, ex, actly, but the London county council, has merged it into St. James\' square,, of which it is really a part. The street, is only a little over 60 feet in length, The main reason for wiping out the, little street is because the residents, of John street prefer to consider, themselves as denizens of "St. James\', square,” for in London one\'s address, makes a world of difference. People, living in a “swell neighborhood" can, sport the address in tht ir letter head, ing. Thus a floorwalker in a tive, cent bazar can have his letters sent, to “Buckingham Palace Mansions,”, conveying the impression that he lives, just around the corner from the king., John street residents rather pride, themselves on their nearness to the, aristocratic square where the duke of, Norfolk, loot\'d Avebury, better known, as Sir John Lubbock, and other lead, ing lights of the nobility live and, move and have their being., The loss of John street will not be, greatly felt by the postoffice authori, ties, considering the fact that there, still are 132 John streets in the Lon, don directory. Nearly every district, has one or two John streets, and some, have four or five. This strange state, of affairs is due to the fact that Lon, don has grown up by the merging of, a lot of separate villages, and, in the, early days, each village, of course,, named its streets irrespective of other, nearby hamlets. Thus, you will find, scattered all over London a number of, “High" streets, which simply means, that when that particular section com, posed a village it had its “High" or, “Main” street. Where in America the, principal thoroughfare of a town is, called “Main" street, th-1 term “High”, is used in England, as it is the prin, cipal highway through the village., This multiplication of street names, often leads to great confusion, espe, cially for Americans and other tour, ists stopping in London for a short, time. Hence, it is most important, that street names should be addition, ally Identified by the mention of their, proximity to larger thoroughfares., Also the direction in which they lie, from the city of London proper us, ually is apprehended, such as “S W .", for southwest, “E. C.” for east central,, and so forth. If one simply addresses, a letter to High street, the chances, are that the missive literal y will “box, the compass" before It reaches its, proper destination., ELECTRICITY IN FISH., Those finny things which secure, their food by means of the electric, batteries with which nature has fitted, them are somewhat remarkable. The, gymnotus, or electric eel, of South, America is probably the best known, of these It has four batteries, which, extend nearly the whole length of its, body. The current passes from front, to back, and, remarkable to relate, ex, tends through the animal’s own brain, Some large ones, from six to eight, feet in length, have been known to, kill a horse or a mule outright with a, single discharge., The thunderfish, a species of Afri, can catfish, was even in ancient times, highly recommended by doctors for, oertain troubles, and the torpedo, or, electric ray, exhibits all the known, powers of electricity, rendering tbe, needle magnetic, decomposing chemi, cal compounds and emitting the, spark., GATE WAS A PRISON WINDOW., It is not often that a gate is made, out of a window, much less out of a, prison window; but the gate of St., Cedd\'s churchyard, Canning Town,, East London, was at one time a win, dow in old Newgate prison. Many, people wonder at the size of the gate,, but when they hear its curious his, tory and the use to which it was put, In years gone by they understand the, reason of its massive dimensions., Only One in the World, I- ggrrirsm..., .\\bove is shown a section of the, freight subways built under the streets, of Chicago. They run some 46 feet, below the level of the street. The tun, ne s are of two distinct types—truck, tunnels and lateral conduits. The, former follow the main thoroughta-es,, and the latter run out to the less im, , oitant parts of the city. The truck, subways have 18-inch cement walla, ind 21-inch cement floors, the smaller, onduits ten-inch walls and 13-inch, loors. Kmbedded in the concrete are, teel ribs of such length that it is vir, ual y impossible for any weight erect, d abife them to cause the tunnels to, collapse., INGENIOUS MEDICINE CHEST, r 1 I, One of the most ingenious of inven, tions is the medicine chest designed, by an Arkansas man. With this, chest there is no excuse for a person, not taking his medicine on time or for, getting the medicines mixed. The, cabinet consists of a stand with two, little drawers at the upper corners, and a desk portion on top. In front, of the desk portion is a little door,, just about wide enough to admit a, bottle, and inside is a series of re, volving trays. One of these trays is, provided with numbers indicating, minutes, another with numbers indi, cating the hours of the day, and a, third with ordinals indicating the, hours of the day and night. Each, tray is divided into little compart, ments at sach hour, so that at a cer, tain hour a bottle in that compart, ment will be waiting at the door.

It is a large fish ten feet, in length and weighing 164 pounds., They swim about usually in pairs in, rough and windy weather with the, huge fins above the water., It is a favorite food fish and the, annual catch is nearly 2,000,000, pounds. The sail fish is caught by, means of a harpoon., Another food fish known as a dol, phin or dorado is sometimes caught in, a curious way. The fishes congregate, under a decoy bush and raft made of, bamboos, and are then caught by, hooks baited with squids. Or the, decoy bush is surrounded by a seine, net and the dolphins are driven by, beating the surface of the water with, sticks. This fish is eaten both fresh, and salt and is as great a favorite in, western Japan as the salmon is in the, northwest., SEISMOGRAPH IS SENSITIVE., Seismometers, or seismographs, as, they are more generally termed, are, instruments for detecting or measur, ing the earthquake shock or wave,, •some of the modern ones are extreme, ly delicate and sensitive, so sensi, tive, in fact, according to Milne, that, if the solid column of masonry com, municating with the rocky floor be, pressed with the hand, the seismo, graph which rests on the masonry, will be affected, and the horizontal, boom or pendulum will be set in rap, id vibration. If two Milne seismo, graphs provided with horizontal pen, delums be put on high buildings op, posite each other on one of London\'s, traflic streets when crowded with, heavy drays, they will show that the, tops of the buildings bend over slight, ly toward each other., MAGNETS USED FOR LIFTING., Lifting by electromagnets In large, cranes has become an Important, means of handling masses of iron and, steel, and hand magnets are now, proving a great convenience for pick, ing up tacks, nails, screws and other, material in store and factory.

The magnet can be, attached to an ordinary 110-volt , di, rect-current circuit, and is energized, by closing the circuit by means of a, push button on the handle.

Albert—, the man of moose—rather surprised, me by wishing to come down too, not, as a hunter, since he knew nothing of, the Stihine and its bears, but as, steersman of the boat, in which capac, ity he proved himself an adept. Just, as we were starting, Mr. But.er, who, had been hunting in the Iskoot moun, tains, turned up with three splendid, sheep’s heads. He wished a "lilt”, for 20 miles down stream to the cab, I in of a certain Capt. Conover, an old, prospf \'tor and trapper who lives on, this lonely stream and knows all, about bears. Mr. Butler had had a, good chance at a fine grizzly on the, mountains, but alas, he had missed it,, and was anxious to retrieve his inis, fort me. He stayed with Conover three, day* and then came down stream,, hav\'ng seen and missed two grizzlies., Siortly after leaving Conover’s hut, and having passed all the worst of the, rapids, we came in sight of a great, overflow which is known as Mc, Leod’s slough. Just before reaching, the slough I noticed a black spot, about 600 yards down stream, which, proved to be a bear swimming the, river. All was excitement in a min, ute. The bear, a medium-sized one,, reached the bank as we careened into, broken water at the bottom of the rap, id. The distance was not more than, 50 yards, yet I found it almost im, possible to get even a snap-shot, ow, ing to the rolling of the boat. Seeing, that we should in a moment shoot past, the bear, 1 let three somewhat hope, less shots in quick succession, each of, which struck the sand about three, inches below the mark, and had the, mortification of observing the boar, • walk slowly into the heavy bush with, complete indifference., Next morning, in most horrible, • weather, we whizzed down stream to, a spot which, if only the sun would, shine upon it, might be described as, among the most beautiful in the world., Under vast mountains about 50 miles, below Telegraph creek a small stream, cuts into the shaggy forest. One side, is overshadowed by precipitous rocks, and the other by a dense forest of, g-eat trees. This is called Klooch, man’s canyon, and the stream that, pierces it is a spawning-ground of the, humpback salmon, and consequently a, favorite resort of bears. We lauded, about 400 yards above it, when D.ivey, and I at once proceeded to stalk the, place., There were no bears there that, morning, but an abundance of fresh, signs. Twenty black bears and at, least one large grizzly must have, | been catching salmon for several, days, so we withdrew as noiselessly, as possible and went up stream and, fc down wind for a quarter of a mile, and made camp for the day., Three o\'clock In the afternoon la, the usual hour for bears to start feed, ing, so Albert, Davey and I again re, peated our stalk to the brook mouth, at this hour. The last few yards I, went on alone, and at first was much, disappointed at seeing nothing but a, black dipper diving in the shallows, within a few yards. The forest and, cliff cast a deep gloom on the little, river; it was snowing as usual, and, the light was so poor that I had to, look a long time at two black marks, about 80 yards away in the middle of, the stream to determine their nature., Presently, as 1 watched one of these, strange things. It seemed to move., Was I dreaming or had It really, moved? Yes, It moved again, and I, saw a large black paw suddenly come, * out of the water and grab at some, thing which it seemed to miss. After, gazing intently I saw that the other, black mark was the head of a large, black bear with cocked ears. The, bear was fishing, and had made three, unsuccessful shots at salmon as they, swam past him. On the second occa, sion I think he touched the fish in his, grab, for 1 distinctly saw him open, his mouth and show his white teeth, in anticipation of seizing the expected, prize. I would not have disturbed him, for the world, as I wanted to see the, whole business of bear-fishing, but I, iS/WASH PA/YOS, must have moved my rifle up into a, ihooting position somewhat olusml, \'y, or he heard orte of the Indians stir, ring behind me, for, with two great, piling*, s backward, he was out of the, river in a trice and shuffling along the, cliff-banks into some short bushes. He, appeared to be the largest black bear, I had seen, and his coat "waved" as, he ran. I was most careful with my, first shot, but the beast “skidded", sideways on some wet alders just as, he entered the bushes and my shot, was a clean n iss. I then saw that If, he continued in his present line he, must emerge and cross about 15 yards, of open mud under the cliff, so that, during the time he was scrambling, through the bushes I took two steps, down the bank and obtained my fa, vorite shooting position, sitting with, my back to a log. I was quite ready, for the bear immediately he cleared, the bushes at a shuffling run, and cov, ering him with the white sight I let, go. The big fellow* stumbled forward, about 50 yards, and then rolled over, on his side uttering two or three baby, like whines, which can only be de, scribed as pitiful. 1 now ran up the, stream, and crossed where there was, a fallen tree, soon reaching the bear,, which was quite dead. He proved to, be a splendid old male measuring five, feet six inches, and would have. 1, should guess, weighed at least 50C, pounds., So we had a great rejoicing and 1, had obtained a grand specimen of, this beautiful animal. We had a ter, rible business getting the bear from, the stream to the river. I wanted to, take him to camp complete so that we, could skin, draw and measure in com, fort. and it was only after cutting a, pole and slingin;, him on it that the, entire staff succeeded in conveying, the huge carcass yard by yard across, the sand banks to the river, where our, canoe was in waiting. The Indians, soon made an immense fire and after, a generous supper we all set to work, on our several tasks and the relation, of bear stories both grewsome and hu, morous. The following day was a, continuous snowstorm, so I declined, to move and made the Indians finish, the scraping of the bear’s skin—no, little task., In the northwest you do not kill, many things, but when you do get a, good specimen of one of the great, northern beasts it is something to be, proud of. Every occasion on which, the hunter is successful is a red-letter, day forever afterwards and indelibly, stamped on the memory. So far I had, been successful in obtaining all the, large American mammals, except the, grizzly bear, and that is a beast of, such elusive character that no man, can say when and where his chance, will occur. Baron Vo» Plessen, an en, thusiastic Danish hunt \\ told a friend, of mine that it cost him over $10,000, before he saw one, and then—he, missed it. But he killed two after, wards. Every hunter that ever set, foot in the Rockies or the northwest, thinks he is going to see grizzly round, the first corner, while a few hope to, goodness the bear will not see them., J. G. MILLAIS., One Thing He Could Do., During the South African war there, was a young officer ju3t from Sand, hurst, who was attached to Gen., French’s staff. The young fellow has, himself achieved some distinction, since then, and shall be nameless. At, that time he was fresh and fidgety,, and was always imagining a constant, menace of attack by the Boers, whom, he invariably pronounced “Bores.”, This pronunciation Gen. French had, in vain tried to correct, and it grad, ually got on his nreves. One day the, young officer came to the general to, report that he believed he could make, out through his field-glass quite as, many as 20 "Bores" hid in the rocks, above his camp. “Bores, you say?", inquired the general. “Yes, sir, Bores. Can I do anything, sir?" "Yei, don’t add to them.”, A GREAT ANNOYANCE., Kidney Disease Shows Many Painful, and Unpleasant Symptoms., George S.

It was admitted, that Quaker Scotch Oats was as pure, and clean as possible and that it was, an ideal food., It is so cheap that any one can af, ford it and so nourishing that every, one needs it. The result of last year’s, experiments at Yale and other points, where food values were tested is that, Quaker Scotch Oats has been adopted, by many persons as their food on, which they rely for adding vigor and, endurance of muscle and brain., This splendid food is packed in the, regular size packages and in hermet, ically sealed tins.

I had an al, most constant p;jin in the small of my, back, and if I stood on my feet foi, any length of time while doing my, housework I became exhausted. At, times dizzy spells came on without, warning and were accompanied by, terrible headaches. My health was, rapidly becoming poor and I was dis, couraged, as none of the medicines I, took did me any good. I heard Doan\'s, Kidney Pills so highly praised for, complaints like mine that I decided, to give them a trial and procured a, box at White’s drug store. They gave, me prompt relief and in three or four, weeks after I commenced their use my, health and strength had returned.
