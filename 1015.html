A\nW., Alva, Oklahoma.\nCotton seed is worth about three-\nfifths as much as cotton seed meal\nheartily. She\nblood v milk\nIve me\nfor feeding dairy cows, according to\nexperiment carried on at the Missis\nsippi Experiment Station. In corapir-i-2g\ncotton seed with wheat, braa and\ncon they came to the conclusion at\nthat station that cotton seed was\nworth about nine-tenth as much as\nTiheat bran and worth one-tenth more\nthan corn and cob meal it is prob\nable that it would not show as high\na comparative value when fed -with\nalfalfa hay aa with Johnso ngrass,\nand it is also provable that a mix\nture of corn and cotton seed or\ncotton seed meal would prove better\nthan either feed alone.\nCotton seed and cotton Beed meal\nwould not bo fed in large quantities\nto stock of any kind They will sup\nply nitrogenous matter muc. more\ncheaply than wheat hran, but \'&\npounds of cotton seed meal or 6\njiounda of cotton seen is aDout ai\nthat should be fed per day, to a\noalry cow for any length of time.\nCotton seed and cotton seed meai\nproduces a firm, light colore d butter,\nwhich makes them valuable for teed\ning in summer. Other experiments\ncarried out at the same station with\ncotton seed and octton seed meal,\nthe cotton seed being roasted in some\nfeeding trials and boiled in others,\nshowed that boiled cotton seed gave\nthe most economical returns, with\nraw cotton seed next and cotton\neeed third at the current market\nprices, at t ha t time.\nCotton seed mea. is worth about\ng .00 per ton a a fertiiUer,, estimated\nat the current prices of 18 cents per\npound for nitrogen and G cents per\npound f,ach for potash and phosphoric\naaic. and at the same prices cotton\nseej would be worth shout $ 1 2.00 per\nton. as a fertili.er ajpne. The reason\nthat the cotton seed docs not show\nup as hih value as a fertilizer is\naccounted for by the fact that the\noil In the cotton seed has a high\nreeding vain.\' nut no fTCImng vsl\nue. Assuming that half of tb etertil\nising value In the feed stuffs in re\nfUirn to the farm after allowing for\nstuall amount that is used in build\niiu up the animal body and the\nfront that will be lost, each tcQ of\ncotton se.-.\'i n."a! b .-tight and fed on\nthe farm adds $15.00 worth to the\nfertility of the farm, in addition to\nthe profits made from it as a feed\ntoff, and a ton of cotton seed about\n$a.oo woith.\nC. I BRAT,\nDept. ot Aniroai Husbandry,\nOk la h" ma A & M. College.\nStillwater\nWe are receiving a great manv\nin\nquiries this season regarding cows\nthat are giving clotted or stringv milk\nStringy milk Is caused hy bacterial\ninfection which may occur either In\nthe cow or after the milk has been\ndrawn from the udder. The germs\nthat cause stringy milk are sometimes\nfound in the water with which the\nutensils are washed, or may be locat\ned in the dust that blows around the\nbarn and whih may get into the milk.\nAbsolute cleanliness is the only war\nto prevent this kind of infection. AH\nutensils should be carefully washed,\nscalded and ke.pt where they will not\nbe contaminated before using. When\nthe infection is in tho cow it ia a\nlittle harder to treat. Hyposulphite\nof Soda and Bi-Sulphlte of Soda are\nrecommended for such troubles and\nmay he given in doses of one-ouarter\nto one-half ounce per day in water.\nWashing out the teats with a milk\ntube and sjringe using a 2 per cent\nboric acid solution is sometimes\nrecommended, but a great deal Of\ncare has to be taken not to infect the\nudder by carelessness in cleansing the\nmilk tube. In using a milk tube the\ntube should be either well boiled be\nore using or should be kept in a good\ndisinfectant solution and the orifice\nof the teat should be also well cleaned\nbefore using the milk tube. - The red\nor bloody color in tho milk is prob\nably due to a special germ, mlcrocoeus\nprodigiosus, which may cause a simi\nlar red color in other food products\nIt is probably getting into the milk\nafter it is drawn from the cow.\n0.

Your home merchants can duplicate the prices made by any\nresponsible concern anywhere, on goods of equal quality, in\nthe same quantities and on the same basis of delivery and\npayment.\n2. You can examine your purchases in the home stores and be\nassured of satisfaction before investing your money.\n3. Your home merchants are always ready and willing to make\nright any error or any defective article purchased.\n4. Your home merchants help support, through direct and Indi\nrect taxation, your schools, churches, libraries and other\npublic institutions.\n5. "Sour home merchants help make a good local market for\neverything you have to sell, and that market more than\nany other one factor gives your land its present value.\n0. Your home merchants are your good friends, ever ready to\nextern! a helping hand in time of need.\n7. If this community is good enough for you to live in and make\nyour money in, \'tis good enough to spend it in.\n8. The best citizens in this community are those who believe ia\nand practice home patronage. Be one of the best!\n9. The merchants in the distant city give you nothing valuable\nthat the home merchants can not give you and the former\ncannot and will not do for you many things the latter do\ngladly.\n10. Every dollar kept in circulation in this community helps in\ncrease property values. Every dollar sent out of this com\nmunity that could as well be spent here, hinders the wheels\nof progress and helps build up some other community at\nyour expense.
