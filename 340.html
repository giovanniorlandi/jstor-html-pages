PARRY, formerly of the, editorial staff of the Port, land Oregonian and the Seat, tle Post-Intelligencer, later comptrol, ler of Seattle, and still later connected, with Morans, Seattle\'s big ship build, ing concern, and a director in a score, of corporations, who is one of the, leaders of the Progressive party in, Washington State, and by many re- <, garded as the greatest mental force in I, that party there, delivered a remark- ], I ably strong speech In Seattle the othei, [ day, answering the Invitation ol, j Comptroller W. A. Prendergrast, ol, i New York, to the Progressives to jolt, him In returning to the Republicar, party. Mr. Parry laid particular stress, on the admitted purpose of the desire, for the union of the two factions of the, opposition?the defeat of President, Wilson and the Democratic party. He, said he sees no demand and no reus, on for a demand to defeat the-Presl, dent and the progressive Democratic, administration that are fulfilling plat, form promises. He defended Presi, dent Wilson ngainst the criticisms ol, the New York man, and said if forced, to change his politics because of dis, integration of the Progressive party, he will become a Democrat. "I could, become a Wilson Democrat but never, again a standpat Republican," he said., The position of Mr. Parry is that, of many others. If the Progressive, party should be cast upon the rocks, next November, It will be found that, many of its crew will leave the wreck, to battle for their political convictions, under the colors of Democracy as long, as they shall be borne aloft by Wilson, and Bryan and the progressive element, of the party., The success of the Camp Fire Girls, entertainment following so many oth, er great successes of late indicates, that there is an effective working, agreement between Juneau and suc, cess., "Sixteen British cotton mills have, closed down for a week."
