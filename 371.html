The conflict his been waged\nback and forth across the ancient\nkingdom so long that agriculture has\nhad but little chance, and, except in\nthose sections where the German\nforces have been In control for some\ntime, the fields are barren and un\ntitled, scarred by miles upon miles of\nearth works.\nFrom the East Prussian boundary\nto approximately the old Rawka posi\ntions there is visible the maximum\namount of order and peaceful quiet.\nAt the Rawka, however, theintermin\nable graves with their helmet adorned\ncrosses, the deep slashes in the earth\nthat once were trenches but now are\nthe temporary "homes" of countless\nrefugees, the maze of partly destroyed\nbarbed wire entanglements and tbe\nsuccession of burned and ruined vil\nlages begin.\nFor miles, between Alexandrovo oh\nthe boundary and Warsaw, and be\ntween Warsaw and Lodz, the old\ntrenches line the railroad, while\ngraves, individual and common, line\ntbe trenches. Eastward of Warsaw,\nhowever, the trenches virtually stop,\nfor tbe Russians moved fast once they\nabandoned the capital of Poland. The\ntrenches stop, but the devastated vil\nlages do not Rather they increase in\nnumber, and there is scarcely a rail\nroad station—and no bridges—left\nstanding.\nThe Poles from time immemorial\nhave been accustomed to building\ntheir thatched cottages—huts would\nbe a better word—close together. Ac\ncordingly, it was necessary only to set\nlire to one structure in order to burn\nthem all. In consequence, countless\nvillages have been reduced to forlorn\nrows of chimneys, which, being of\nbrick and stoutly built, resisted tbe\nflames.\nUnlike tbe cities of Poland, the\ncountry seems to have been stripped\nof young men. One sees little else\nthan peasant women, barefoot, ill\nClad, who struggle under bundles of\n\'wood through tbe mud, and who gen\nerally avert their eyes as strangers\npass.\nThe Germans, partly for their own\nbenefit, partly to give employment to\nthe Poles, have doae much to put the\nnotoriously bad roads in shape. They\nhave also altered the railroad from the\nRussian to the German gauge—a stu\npendous work, for all the main lines\nare now double track, and at Impor\ntant points huge yards have had to be\nbuilt to conform to military needs.\nTbe destruction in many parts of\nPoland is so general that village after\nvillage hasno single house standing.\nBoth soldiers and\'the\'Civil population\nhave bad to rely on their Inventive\nness to obtain shelter, and all along\nthe railroad lines freight cars, Russian\nand German, are being used as houses.\nIn tbe case of the Russian cars the\nwheels have been removed, the cars\nhave been set flat on the ground and\ntbe interiors fitted up with some de\ngree of comfort.\nCarried Baby 280 Miles on Rack.\nSouth Bethlehem, Pa.—Joseph Dane\nko\nhas\narrived here after a remarkable\ntrip from a northern Canadian town.\nDanzko carried his ten-month-old baby\n2fi0 miles\non his back, Indian style,\nand\nsustained Ha life by feeding it\nwith crackers and water.\nSTRANQER IN THEIB HOME\nSurprise for PenneytvanMrii ill R*\ntumFrem vacation—Walter\nLewtsburg, Pa.—When Prof. Nor\naaa Stewart of Bucknel! onlyerslty\nwife returned home from.\niff®*!\nIOWA STATS BY\nAMERICAN AIRMEN WHO AID FRANCE\nLeft to right- Sergt fclliott C\'owdln Sergt Norman Prince of Boston and\nLlent- William Thaw, three American birdmen who. for daring deeds on tbe\nbattlefields of Prance, bare been decorated for bravery, and came back to tbe\nUnited States to spend Christmas with their folks at bome.

Place in a chaf\ning dish a tablespoonful of butter, and\nwhen this is melted and hot add two\ntablespoonfuls of grated cheese. \'Stir\nuntil smooth, then add the-eggs and\nseason with paprika and salt.

D.\nIn the light of new investigations\nin medicine, and as old data are pon\ndered anew, more and more attention\nis being given to the health of chil\ndren. Th® conservation of youthful\nenergy, the pre\nvention of infec\ntion and detailed\ninstruction in hy\ngiene are the\nkeynotes of pre\nventive medi\ncine.\nBefore the new\nideas can become\nentirely useful\nsome very old\nor.co must be eradicated, absolutely\nforgotten. There is no more reason\nthftt a child should have measles,\nmumps or whooping coogh than it\nshould be hit on the head with a\nbrick. These diseases do not lonfer\nimmunity, nor do they, or boils, puri\nfy the blood. The fact that a person\nhas never been sick before does not\nmake them more liable to die than\nif the same affliction befell a person\nwho has had all the diseases in the\ncategory. There is as much reason\nin getting sick as an insurance\nagainst further sickness as there is\nin gettiny a leg broken.\nThe future efficiency of citizens,\ngranting that they are born normal,\ndepends very much on the develop\nment of several glands, or which we\nhear little. These glands are called\nsuperrenal, because they are situated\non top of the kidneys, the thyroid,\nwhich is just in front of the "Adam\'s\napple," the pitituary gland, which is\nin the skull, certain of the intestinal\nglands and the ser glands. Upon the\nproper action of these glands with\ntheir so-called internal secretions de\npend a proper balance of growth and\ndevelopment. These glands are very\ndelicate in structure and especially\nin growing organisms. High tem\nperatures, diarrhoea, infections and\nimproper rest materially interfere\nwith their blood supply and growth\nwhen even temporary drainage is\nmade upon them we often have disas\ntrous results following. This does\nnot take into account the too fresuent\nadmage to heart muscle, ears, eyes\nand kidneys which follows in the\nwake of such so-called harmless dis\nease as measles, mumps and whoop\ning cough.\nWhile it is true that we do not\nknow how to keep every child abso\nlutely free from all the suffering and\ndamage which acute infections often\nleave, every one can follow out cer\ntain general rules among them: First,\nprotect children from infections, by\nkeeping them away from sick folks—\nno matter if it be a "simple cold."\nSecond, build boxes for the creeping\nand toddling youngsters, thereby\nprotecting them from the cold\ndraughts of air on the floors, which\nare directly responsible for so much\npneumonia.\nr,\nThird, teach children,\nearly, the use of tooth brushes, since\nit is definitely proven that many gen\neral infections are primarily mouth\ninfections. Fourth, and necessarily\nas important as three, clean hands\nbefore eating. That peck of dirt yarn\nis not a requirement, but a. result of\ncarelessness and ignorance. Fifth,\nteach children the importance of\navoiding intimate contact with other\nsick children, for what appears to be\na harmless matter with one child may\nbe the death of another. Keep the\nchildren welt, for upon them the bur\ndens of the future will fall. The\nLord does not call as many children\nas we send to Him by rarelessness\nand ignorance.\nMONMOUTH, ILL.\n(This Week\'s News.)\nMiss\nEssie Neil, who is staying in\nChicago,\nin home spending her vaca\xad\ntion with her parents.\nThe presiding elder\'s committee of\nthe A.
