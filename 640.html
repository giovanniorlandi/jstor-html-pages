Attorney\nGeneral Wickersham, former sugar\ntrust attorney, and 1 ccretury of\nCommerce and Labor Nagln former\nattorney for the Waters-Pierce\n(Stan\'Jprd) Oil Company.\nThen in his immediate family\ncircle the presid nl has Brother\nCharles P. Taft, who is so consti\ntuted temperamentally and\nfinancially that he can view legis\nlation only from the view point\nthat "Big Business" views it; and\nalso Brother Henry W. Taft, a\nmember of th - New York law\nfirm of Strong & Cadwallader,\nwhich represents the sugar trust,\nWall street and the great\nindustrial corporations.\nFor substantiation of any advice\nthe president may receive from\nthese sources, he has but to call in\nSenator Lippitt, Aldrich\'s suc\ncessor from Rhode Island.

Hall of Searchlight, who i J\nstaying ut th.? l.?nk-\' rshim, is\ncrdited with being the discoverer .\nof ono of the largest known bodies j\nof tanthalium, sometimes known\nas columhite, in the Unite States.\nHe has hecn two years foreman of\nSuperior Nevada mines. It was!\nwhile working in one of the drifts\nc.f this silver property that h?"\nran across a vein of the rare!\nmetal. It is the hardest metal I\nknown in metallurgy mid in a!\nrecent test in New York, a thin\nsheet withstood seventy- two h ours\nof drilling with n diamond point\ndrill.\nIn addition to his mining\ninterests, Hall is an inventor of\nseveral aeronautical devices. lie\nhas perfected several new models\nof dirigible balloons.\nBREWERS\' BRIBE 10 TEXAS I\nI\nThe last breeze from Texas\nbrings n significant nttermath of\nthe Saturday clash. (in)vcst<n\nannounces that \'\'the brewers have\nagreed to set aside a .$500,000\nfund annually, and to be responsi\nble for the entorcement of saloon\nlaws, if the prohibitionists will\naccept their state-wide election\ndefeat as settled." This is good\nbusiness ? for the brewers. Hav\ning spent "nearly" one million, h i\n"nearly" which is conservatively\naccounted two millions, the\nbrewers Will be making n vefy\nw\'iro expenditure of $500,000 in j\n"cinching" the fraudulent result,\naccomplished by the use of four\ntimes that sum. Kvidently the\nbrewers of Grilveflton have some ,\ntrepidation ns to whether or not\nthis $500,000 bribe could be used\nwith entire satisfaction in the leg\nislative inquiry into the dark\nmn7.cn of the by-gone election.\nTherefore it is tendered direct to\nthe enemy in such a frnnk and\nnaive manner as to shame all cries\nof corruption. We fear that the\nTexas drys will feel compelled to\ndecline this cash indemnity for\nthe indignities heaped upon the\nballot box. They seem to have a\nclear case to go before the legis\nlature and $500,000 is not near the\nproper price to offer patriotic sons\nof the Alamo as compensation for\nthe surrender of their r.ght of\nsuffrage .to the Galveston brewers\nand their following of negroes,\nMexicans and slurnmies. And our\nunderstanding of tne ardent Texan\nis that he is peculiarly tenaciout\nof the right of self-government,\nand that he has no desire to see the\nreins of state politics handled\nfrom St. Louis instead of Austin. ?\nAmerican Advance.\ni MYSTERY OF THE UMBRELLA\nPittsburg Sho * keeper Wondered About\nIt for Many Days ?
