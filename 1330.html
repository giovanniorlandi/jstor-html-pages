Nurses are \nusually trained in private or public schools and colleges of nursing for a period of two years \n(for enrolled nurses) and four years (for comprehensive basic nursing) (South African Nursing \nCouncil 1975; 1993a; 1993b). The military in South Africa train their own enrolled nurses within \nthe military schools of nursing for two years as pupil enrolled nurses (PEN), although under \nthe same South African Nursing Council regulation 2175 for the training of regular enrolled \nnurses (South African Nursing Council 1993a). The military PEN commence with a six-month \nbasic military training to prepare them as soldiers first before they embark on a two-year nursing \nprogramme, on completion of which they are registered as enrolled nurses.\nMaginnis and Croxon (2007:218) insist that the clinical placement of students needs to prepare \nthem adequately for practice in an environment that is constantly changing. Whilst nurses are \ngenerally trained in corresponding private and public clinical learning environments (CLEs), \nmilitary nurses receive their own clinical learning experiences in the military health and public \nhealth institutions, for diverse clinical placement and to be exposed to different health care \nexperiences that will equip them to nurse holistically (Purdie, Sheward & Gifford 2008:315).\nThis arrangement of placing military students in public health institutions was made because \nmilitary hospitals were initially used only as a sickbay (a room for treating sick and injured soldiers) \nand for visiting the doctor on an outpatient basis. They therefore lacked diverse clinical exposure \nfor their students. These students, including PEN, have to experience different challenges in two \ndiverse CLEs. In the military health system only members of the military (various ranks) and \nBackground: The clinical learning environment is a complex social entity that influences \nstudent learning outcomes in the clinical setting. Students can experience the clinical \nlearning environment as being both facilitative and obstructive to their learning. The clinical \nenvironment may be a source of stress, creating feelings of fear and anxiety which in turn \naffect the students’ responses to learning. Equally, the environment can enhance learning if \nexperienced positively.\nObjectives: This study described pupil enrolled nurses’ experiences of facilitative and \nobstructive factors in military and public health clinical learning settings.\nMethod: Using a qualitative, contextual, exploratory descriptive design, three focus group \ninterviews were conducted until data saturation was reached amongst pupil enrolled nurses \nin a military School of Nursing.\nResults: Data analysed provided evidence that acceptance by clinical staff and affordance \nof self-directed learning facilitated learning. Students felt safe to practise when they were \nsupported by the clinical staff. They felt a sense of belonging when the staff showed an interest \nin and welcomed them. Learning was obstructed when students were met with condescending \ncomments. Wearing of a military uniform in the public hospital and horizontal violence \nobstructed learning in the clinical learning environment.\nConclusion: Students cannot have effective clinical preparation if the environment is not \nconducive to and supportive of clinical learning, The study shows that military nursing \nstudents experience unique challenges as they are trained in two professions that are \nhierarchical in nature. The students experienced both facilitating and obstructing factors to \ntheir learning during their clinical practice. Clinical staff should be made aware of factors \nwhich can impact on students’ learning. Policies need to be developed for supporting students \nin the clinical learning environment.\nAuthors:\nEucebious LekalakalaMokgele1\nErnestine M.

The uniqueness \nof the CLE in the military health service means that the \nexperiences of the PENs in the military are different from \nthose in the public sector. Firstly, their workplace learning \ntakes place in a military milieu where power ranks are \nmore pronounced. It is where they may have to treat highranking\npersonnel as their patients and have to also contend \nwith high-ranking clinical staff who are often also trained \nin military nursing and military culture. Secondly, because \nof the limited number of clinical areas in the military health \nservice, students are allocated to public hospitals where they \ntake care of civilian patients under different conditions than \nexist in the military setting.\nLiterature reveals that there are both facilitative and \nobstructive factors to students’ learning within this \nenvironment (Löfmark & Wikblad 2001:49). The researcher’s \npersonal experience of five years as an educator in the \nmilitary health service, as well as her concern about the \nneed to understand the dynamics that facilitate or obstruct \nlearning, led to initiation of this project in order to investigate \nthe experiences of PEN in the military health service. This \nhas not been done previously in South Africa and it was not \nknown how these PEN would describe their experiences in \nthese two diverse clinical settings. The following research \nquestion was asked: ‘How do military PEN experience their \nclinical learning environment?’\nDefinition of key concepts\nClinical learning environment\nIn this study, the CLE is a learning environment accredited by \nthe South African Nursing Council where students acquire \nthe knowledge and skills to manage both military patients \nof various ranks and their family members. It also includes \nthe public health sector which accommodate civilian patients \nfrom all spheres of South African society.\nMilitary health setting\nThis is a formal setting for the development of various skills, \nincluding clinical skills, that will prepare PEN in times of war \nand defence of the country. PEN are trained to care for sick or \ninjured soldiers and their families in the line of battle.\nPublic health setting\nA setting that mobilises local, State, national and international \nresources to ensure optimal conditions for people’s health. \nIt comprises preventive, curative and rehabilitative services \n(Basu, Jina & Naidoo 2008:7).\nPupil enrolled nurses\nThis term refers to persons undergoing a two-year programme \nat an approved nursing school, who have complied with the \nprescribed conditions and have furnished the prescribed \nparticulars as required by section 24 x of the Nursing Act 50 \nof 1978 (Republic of South Africa 1978).\nLiterature review\nLiterature suggests that nursing students’ clinical placement \nexperiences are often fraught with longitudinal and \nmultidimensional challenges (Clare et al. 2003). These \nchallenges include a lack of support of students (from both \nthe CLE staff and their facilitators), which can lead to missed \nopportunities in terms of teachable moments (Newton, Billet \n& Ockerby 2009). Reports suggest that nurses deal more with \ndocumentation than patient care – the feeling that there is \na lack of interpersonal relationships between students, staff \nmembers and the patients is also documented (Pearcey & \nDraper 2008:595). The CLE is even recognised as a source of \nstress that creates feelings of fear and anxiety, which in turn \naffect the students’ responses to learning (Chesser-Smyth \n2005:320).\nAccording to Levett-Jones and Lathlean (2009:348) students \ncan experience the CLEs as belligerent if they are constantly \ncriticised and judged harshly by clinical staff. For many \nstudents, clinical placements are typified by a feeling of \nalienation and a lack of belonging (Goh & Watt 2003:14; \nNewton et al. 2009:633). These behaviours can be obstructive \nto learning. According to Löfmark and Wikblad (2001:46), \nthe CLE is obstructive to learning when there is no student–\nsupervisor relationship and/or when supervisors make \ncondescending comments, are irritated or not interested in \nstudents and do not allow students to take part in patient \ncare activities.\nViolence is another factor that is obstructive to learning. \nCarley and Mackway-Jones (2005:26) suggest that nursing \nprofession is hierarchical and is embedded in the military \nsystem. This hierarchy results in student nurses experiencing \n‘horizontal violence’ (Curtis, Bowen & Reid 2007:156), with \njunior members in the profession being bullied, ignored and \ndisrespected.\nFacilitative factors are considered to be those that promote \nlearning. Literature has identified multiple such factors, \namongst others a sense of belonging and acceptance. A \nnumber of affective consequences are said to influence \nthe student’s sense of belonging, including feeling safe, \ncomfortable, satisfied and happy (Levett-Jones & Lathlean \n2008:103). A sense of belonging is underpinned by a need for \naffirmation, friendship and being part of the group (Friedkin \n2004:410). When students realise that they are not part of \nthe collective, they may present with low self-esteem and \nunhappiness, which may result in a diminished learning \nprocess (Baumeister, Twenge & Nuss 2002:817). It is thus \nimportant to inculcate a sense of belonging that produces \n', 'Page 3 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.curationis.org.za doi:10.4102/curationis.v38i1.1263\nhappy group members, because students who feel ostracised \nby their peers or those in authority will not function optimally \n(Tabane & Human-Vogel 2010:504).\nAccording to Löfmark and Wikblad (2001:47), being \nallowed to take responsibility and to work independently, \nhaving opportunities to practise tasks and receive feedback, \ncollaborating with staff and supervising others, gaining an \noverview of the setting and a sense of control, are all factors \nconsidered to facilitate learning in the CLE. Levett-Jones et \nal. (2007:211) assert that a feeling of acceptance, being valued \nand being involved with others are some of the attributes \nof belonging. The purpose of this article is to explore and \ndescribe PEN experiences of facilitative and obstructive \nfactors in clinical learning in two diverse settings.\nResearch methods and design\nDesign\nAn explorative, descriptive, contextual qualitative research \napproach was used in this study to explore and describe the \nexperiences of PEN in the military health CLE and within \npublic health settings.\nPopulation and sample\nThere was a total of 30 PEN in the studied institution at the \ntime of collecting data for this study, which included PEN in \ntheir second year of training. The second-year PEN have been \nin training for over a year and have been more exposed to \nthe various clinical learning situations, including placements \nin public hospitals. Criteria for inclusion in this study were \nthat participants should be registered as PEN in the Military \nNursing College, must be in their second year of study and \nshould have been allocated to the military health CLE and \npublic hospitals. The final sample size, using the eligibility \ncriteria, was determined by data saturation (Streubert & \nCarpenter 2011:90).\nData collection method\nData were collected by means of focus group interviews. \nA total of 19 students participated in the study voluntarily. \nThree focus group sessions were conducted, with two groups \nconsisting of six members and a third group consisting of \nseven members. An expert in the facilitation of focus groups \nwas approached to act as a moderator for the sessions. \nAppointment of the moderator was important, as the \nresearcher was a facilitator in the nursing college and known \nto the students, so this allowed participants to participate \nfreely in the study. The moderator was a specialist psychiatric \nnurse skilled and experienced in focus group management. \nShe is also an expert in qualitative research. The researcher \nmade arrangements for the venue (a classroom in the \nMilitary Nursing College) in which to conduct interviews. \nThe researcher also clarified the process of focus group \ninterviews to the participants, as well as the expectations \nof the moderator during the interviews and how the \ninterviews would be conducted. Data were recorded using \na tape recorder with the permission of participants and field \nnotes were handwritten by the researcher to capture actual \ndiscussions (Polit & Beck 2005:307). Participants’ reactions \nand attitudes were also observed and noted throughout the \ninterviews. Data were collected until saturation was reached \n(Streubert & Carpenter 2011:90–91).\nData analysis\nThe data were analysed according to Henning’s four-step \nmethod (2004:126). Tape-recorded interviews were listened \nto as soon as the interviews had been completed and these \nwere then transcribed verbatim. The researcher recorded \nand organised the data on note cards and audiotapes were \nlabelled to ease data retrieval. Cross-checking of data with \neach note card was performed to keep track of each piece \nof data collected. Units were then organised into a system \nderived from the data. After the data were organised they \nwere ready to be categorised into themes and sub-themes. \nThe researcher and co-coder created codes from the data \nindependently; extracted codes were then compared for \nsimilarities and differences. Where differences occurred \nthese were resolved, leading to emergence of the themes \nand sub-themes presented in the findings. The co-coder \nwas a specialist in analysing and coding qualitative studies.\nContext of the study\nThe study was conducted in a Military Nursing College, of \nwhich there are three in South Africa. This college is situated \nin an urban area in one of the nine provinces in South Africa. \nA quiet classroom in one particular college was organised by \nthe researcher in which to collect data without distraction.\nEthical considerations\nApproval to conduct this study was obtained from the Ethics \nCommittee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of North-West \nUniversity (Potchefstroom Campus), the Military Ethics \nCommittee and the Officer Commanding of 3 Military \nHospital. A written letter of request was given to the students, \ninviting them to participate in the study. Participants were \ninformed in full about the study and were asked to provide \nwritten consent to participate. They were informed that the \nresearch did not form part of their work and that they could \nwithdraw from participation at any time during the process \nwithout being disadvantaged in any way. All participants \nwere assured that confidentiality would be maintained as \nonly the researcher had access to the audiotaped material. \nAudiotapes were kept locked in a safe place and erased \nafter the research was completed. The use of real names was \navoided.\nTrustworthiness\nTrustworthiness was maintained by using strategies of \ncredibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability \n(Lincoln & Guba 1985:290). The research methodology and \nresearch context were described in detail to enable interested \nresearchers to transfer these to other studies. The results and \n', 'http://www.curationis.org.za doi:10.4102/curationis.v38i1.1263\nPage 4 of 7 Original Research\nfindings of the research process, including raw data, field \nnotes, data reduction and analysis products, and theoretical \nnotes relating to trustworthiness were kept as an audit trail \nof what transpired during the research process to ensure \nconfirmability. Dependability was achieved through clear \ndescription of the exact methods of data collection, analysis \nand interpretation. The appointment of an independent \ncoder with field research expertise also assisted in ensuring \ndependability. Prolonged engagement with the data assisted \nthe researcher in identifying recurring patterns and themes, \nthus ensuring credibility.\nResults\nThis study set out to describe PEN experiences of facilitative \nand obstructive factors in clinical learning in two diverse \nsettings. Two main themes emerged from the analysis: factors \nfacilitating learning and those obstructing learning. Selfdirected\nlearning and acceptance by staff were experienced \nas facilitating PEN learning, whilst non-acceptance by \nstaff, wearing of military uniform in public hospitals and \nworkplace violence were experienced as obstructive to \nlearning.\nFactors facilitating learning\nSelf-directed learning\nThe limited number of learning opportunities in the \nmilitary health setting afforded students ample time to \npractise procedures on these few available opportunities \nand to be in control of their own learning. The ability to \ncontrol their own learning was perceived as empowering: \nthey could make decisions and enjoy learning as they did \nnot feel pressured to complete tasks but could work at \ntheir own pace. This practice made students feel that they \nare trusted to make judgements about patient care, which \nfacilitated learning. This was represented in the following \nexcerpts:\n‘Being a military nurse works at advantage because we are only \nserving military members and their family, so we don’t have too \nmuch pressure on us, we learn at our own pace and given time \nto learn all of those stuff.’ (PEN 1)\n‘They give us the opportunity to find solutions for patients’ \nproblems on our own and to make good judgements.’ (PEN 8)\n‘Here at the military … we are given topics to prepare and \npresent, we look for information ourselves; in that way we get to \nknow what is happening in the ward.’ (PEN 14)\nAcceptance by staff\nAcceptance is another facilitating factor experienced by the \nstudents in this study. They expressed that they felt accepted \nby the doctors and nurses in the public CLE as they received \ngood guidance and supervision from them in the wards of \nthe public hospitals. This created confidence and competency \nin implementing nursing procedures, as the supervisor was \nalways around. The following excerpts validate this:\n‘In the public hospital they accept us as part of the team, and \nthe doctors will explain everything about the patient. We will do \neverything under supervision of the doctor.’ (PEN 2)\n‘In the provincial hospital the sister calls you and teaches you the \nprocedure.’ (PEN 7)\n‘When we are in the outside hospitals and there are procedures \nthat they want us to learn more about, they will call us to watch.’ \n(PEN 10)\nFactors obstructive to learning\nNon-acceptance by staff\nOne respondent said that they did not always feel accepted, \nand was made to feel that they were always in the way, \nparticularly in the military CLE:\n‘Sometimes they will become angry, saying students are just \ncausing traffic. How could I learn when they don’t accept us?’ \n(PEN 11)\nWearing military uniform in public health settings\nWearing military uniform when allocated to public \nhospitals was perceived as being obstructive to learning. \nPEN explained that they felt marginalised when referred \nto as soldiers and not nurses by some staff members. Their \nperception was that they were easily blamed for everything \nthat went wrong because they wore a military uniform. The \nparticipants also alleged that some staff members often made \ncondescending remarks about them and caused them a lot \nof embarrassment. Patient discomfort was also cited. Their \nviews were stated as follows:\n‘Sometimes in public hospitals we feel bad as we wear military \nuniform, because they will call us soldiers and sometimes \nsecurities. They are sometimes not nice.’ (PEN 9)\n‘Maybe something was not done, they will say “it’s the soldiers”; \nit is always a pain for us, they call us soldiers and not nurses. So \nit’s not nice as this embarrasses us.’ (PEN 2)\n‘Patients are also not comfortable when we have to do procedures \non them. They do not see us as nurses, they call us soldiers \nbecause of our uniform.’ (PEN 15)\nWorkplace violence\nParticipants expressed that they were often subjected to \ndifferent forms of violence. These were mostly non-physical \nin nature, in the form of shouting, bad mouthing, being \nblamed and felt punished if one person was in the wrong. \nSome felt that military rules are applied in nursing and \nperceived this in a negative light:\n‘I just want to add on that issue of the shouting, wherever you go \nas long as you in the department they will shout.’ (PEN 5)\n‘They call us, but when they call the college, stating how bad we \nare. The only thing we will hear from them, is how lazy we are, \nbehind the staff nurses’ back, they tell us we work more than \nthem. They talk about us to the staff nurses, when those staff \nnurse are not there they talk about them.’ (PEN 16)\n‘One of the old nurses forgot to take out the temperature, I mean, \nthe thermometer, then when we were supposed to change the \npatient, eh, to give the patient a bed pan that thermometer fell and \nit broke, the glass was all over the bed. They blamed the students, \neven though we came after 3 [pm], they blame the students. If \nanything goes wrong they blame the students.’ (PEN 13)\n', 'Page 5 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.curationis.org.za doi:10.4102/curationis.v38i1.1263\n‘He started swearing at me, verbally abusing me. I then called \nthe police. I opened a case of assault.’ (PEN 14)\n‘The military rules are applied in nursing and it is very \ndestructive. When one student makes a mistake, everybody is \npunished.’ (PEN 6)\nOne of the participants in this study was physically assaulted \nby a high-ranking member whilst carrying out his nursing \nduties:\n‘A rank is misused in the military; I was physically assaulted by \na high-ranking member whilst carrying out my nursing duties.’ \n(PEN 19)\nDiscussion\nFindings show that the students experienced the CLE as both \nfacilitating and obstructive to their learning. Compared to \nthe military setting, students experienced the public CLE to \nbe more facilitative as they felt empowered, could self-direct \ntheir clinical learning and had support from the clinical staff. \nSilén and Uhlin (2008:462) are of the opinion that ‘students’ \nfeelings of being in charge and having a genuine impact on \nthe learning situations are crucial for their desire to take \nresponsibility’. Compton (2005:36) asserts that there is a \nstrong linkage between self-directed learning and positive \npsychology, and that attributes such as perceived control \nand satisfaction are important for self-directed learning \nto occur. Turner (2007) concurs that ‘self-directed learners \ndemonstrate greater awareness of their responsibility in \nmaking learning meaningful and monitoring themselves’, \nthus making them more effective learners and social beings. \nAccording to Löfmark and Wikblad (2001:49), these positive \nattributes are said to be facilitating factors for learning in \nthe clinical setting; these authors showed in their study that \nstudents value independence as a facilitating factor.\nThe second finding was that some participants experienced \nacceptance in the public setting where the staff was supportive \nand willing to supervise them. Several authors posit that it is \nimportant that students fit in and are accepted as part of the \ngroup during clinical placement, as this kind of welcoming \nenvironment is a source of active participation and provides \nlearning opportunities (Hartigan-Rogers et al. 2007:1; LevettJones\n& Lathlean 2009:348; Nash, Lemcke & Sacre 2009:48). \nStaff members need to be available, friendly and willing to \nteach in order to construct a climate conducive to learning \n(Croxon & Maginnis 2009:240).\nIn their study, Levett-Jones and Lathlean (2008:107) found \nthat ‘students felt more empowered and enabled to capitalise \non the available learning opportunities when they felt they \nhad a legitimate place in the nursing team’; conversely, if \nnot accepted, they can find it difficult to learn. Individuals’ \nperceptions about their participation and level of acceptance \nin the group influence their sense of belonging (Tabane & \nHuman-Vogel 2010:493). This sense of acceptance must be \nfostered, as learners who feel ostracised by those in authority \nmay present with low self-esteem and unhappiness. If the \nPEN (learners) feel that they are not part of the collective, their \nfunctioning may not be optimal, resulting in a diminished \nlearning process (Baumeister et al. 2002; Tabane & HumanVogel\n2010:504). According to Chesser-Smyth (2005:320), \nthe morale of students can be boosted if they are welcomed, \nrespected and valued and, as a result, they become more \neager to learn.\nIt is also evident that students are not always accepted in \nthe military CLE. Such behaviour is identified as being \nobstructive to learning (Hathorn, Machtmes & Tillman \n2009:229).\nStudies have shown that a lack of support in the CLE \ncan be a source of anxiety and stress for students (Elliott \n2002:72; Levett-Jones & Lathlean 2008:109; Papastavrou \net al. 2009:176; Shipton 2002:244). Literature cites different \nreasons for a lack of support for students in the clinical \nsetting, including registered nurses seeing facilitation of \nlearning or supervision as extra work for them and the \nunavailability of staff (Clarke, Gibb & Ramprogus 2003:106; \nMongwe 2001:4).\nThe wearing of military uniform was perceived as obstructive \nto learning by participants in the study. They claimed that \nthe uniform caused them embarrassment, that they often \nfelt marginalised and were blamed for multiple wrongs \nregarding patient care. Studies have shown that CLEs can \nbe very traumatic for students when they are exposed to \nharsh remarks and made to feel like outsiders (Hathorn et al. \n2009:242; Levett-Jones & Lathlean 2008:105; Rush, McCracken \n& Talley 2009:315).\nThe hierarchy within both CLEs made the PEN experience \nof clinical learning more challenging and was perceived as \nbeing obstructive to learning.\nThis study shows that participants were exposed to some \nform of workplace violence in the CLE. Workplace violence \nhas many names in nursing literature. According to Mendez \n(2011:2), the phenomenon is known as horizontal violence, \nlateral violence, bullying, and intrapersonal workplace \naggression. I the context of nursing, lateral violence has been \ndefined as ‘nurse-to-nurse aggression’ (Griffin 2004:258). \nAccording to the literature, lateral violence finds expression \nin physical assault, psychological abuse and non-physical \nviolence, such as verbal abuse, mobbing, gossip, jealousy, \nblaming, yelling, insulting, name-calling, lack of respect, \nbullying and intimidation, backstabbing, unfair criticism and \ndefamatory statements about individuals or groups, whether \nit comes from nurses or other healthcare professionals \n(Bartholomew 2006:4–5; Brooks & Phillips 2013:9; Edwards \n& O’Connell 2007:27; Felblinger 2009; Gimeno et al. 2012: 30; \nNachreiner et al. 2007:674)\nHorizontal violence is defined as ‘[r]epeated, offensive, \nabusive, intimidating, or insulting behavior, abuse of power, \nor unfair sanctions that makes recipients upset and feel \n', 'http://www.curationis.org.za doi:10.4102/curationis.v38i1.1263\nPage 6 of 7 Original Research\nhumiliated, vulnerable, or threatened, creating stress and \nundermining their self-confidence’ (Vessey, DeMarco & \nBudin, as quoted in Sellers et al. 2009–2010:21). According to \nKing-Jones (2011:80), horizontal violence includes forms of \nnon-physical intergroup conflict that manifest in overt and \ncovert behaviours of hostility ranging from intimidating \nbody language to sarcastic comments, fault finding, belittling \ngestures, discourtesy, disinterest and discouragement, \namongst other behaviours.\nPEN were also subjected to physical violence. One of the \nparticipants was physically assaulted by a high-ranking \nmember who was not satisfied with the treatment he \nreceived. According to Thomas and Burk (2009:229), \nthis conduct can affect the working environment of \nthe demoralised students and impede their learning. \nExperiences that have been described by PEN are related \nto the two very different roles – being a soldier and being \na nurse – which causes the students to experience conflict. \nFundamentally, one role is about force, aggression and \nviolence whereas the other is about caring for the sick and \nthe injured. It is not established if they have been prepared \nfor these dual role.\nLimitations\nThere are three military nursing colleges in South Africa \nand the findings of the study are limited to the opinions of \nonly one group of second-year students at one of these. It is \ntherefore important to conduct future studies on students in \nother colleges.\nConclusion\nThis study indicates that students experience both facilitating \nand obstructing factors to their learning during their clinical \npractice. The findings indicate that learning in the clinical \nsetting is facilitated when students take responsibility and \ncontrol of their learning and their self-confidence increases. \nStudents feel safe to practise when they are supported by the \nclinical staff. They feel that they belong when the staff shows \ninterest in them and welcomes them.\nThe study also showed that learning is obstructed when \nstudents are not accepted and are met with condescending \ncomments or are blamed and embarrassed by the clinical \nstaff. The lack of supervision in the military setting further \nobstructed their learning. Wearing of military uniform \nduring the public clinical learning seemed to be problematic \nfor the PEN. It was also evident that students experienced \nsome forms of violence in the CLEs. Violence in any form is \nnot conducive to learning and will be obstructive. Students \ncannot effectively be prepared clinically if the environment is \nnot conducive to and supportive of clinical learning. Whilst \nresearch in this setting brought the experiences of military \nPEN to the fore, similar studies on non-military PEN may be \nuseful in order to compare similarities and differences, with a \nview to using such information to improve the teaching and \nlearning environment of students.\nRecommendations\nBased on the conclusions of the study, it is recommended \nthat students be allowed to take responsibility and initiative \nfor their learning, as this can promote learning. It is also \nrecommended that PEN should not be compelled to wear \nmilitary uniform in public hospitals and should be allowed \nto dress in similar uniforms to their counterparts, so that \nthey are not treated differently when allocated to the CLE of \npublic hospitals. Clinical staff should be made aware of the \nimpact that condescending remarks may have on students’ \nlearning. They should also recognise the need to support \nactively and welcome students so as to enhance the working \nenvironment. Policies on managing violence in the clinical \narea need to be developed, with specific attention on how \nthis may affect students, particularly when they are dealing \nwith high-ranked officers. There is also a need to prepare \nstudents for the dual role of being a nurse and a soldier so \nthat they are able to experience the CLEs in a positive light.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Medical Research \nCouncil for funding the study.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no financial or personal \nrelationship(s) that may have inappropriately influenced \nthem in writing this article.\nAuthors’ contributions\nE.M.C.
