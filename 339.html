Toward the American Tobacco Com\npany, te which the present low price for to\nbacco is attributed, there is a Bentiment of\nstrong resentment. The failure of the Farmers\nOrganization of success in consummating their\nplan, through which there was great hope of\nrelief, is a great disappointment. There are,\nhowever, some of the tobacco growers who de\nnet take se pessimistic a view of the situation.\nSince white men began the cultivation of\ntobacco in America the price has fluctuated\nmere probably than that of any ether product\nof the farm. When the yield is geed and the\nprice high, the profit ia enormous; se a few\ngeed crops at high prices have always induced\never-production, a glut in the market, and a\nprice with the bottom out. Then a let-up in the\nproduction, probably a failure of the plant\nbeds, protected until recently only by having\nbrnsh thrown ever them, the surplus would be\nused up and the price high again.\nIn Colonial times, every means that could be\ndevised or imagined was resorted te, even te\nburning large quantities of it in order te main\ntain the high price, but without avail. Fer\nseveral years new the price has been mere\nstable than ever before net very low, net\nvery high, but giving te the diligent man a geed\nreturn for his labor. It is asserted that the\npresent price is tee low, and that the price is\nfixed by the American Tobacco Company.\nThe American Tobacco Company has no right\nte exist except as the servant of the growers\nand consumers of tobacco. Its function is te\ntake the tobacco crop from the hands of the\ngrowers, fit it for use and pas3 it te the user,\nand te receive for its service fair compensa\ntion and no mere. The value of service\ndepends in some degree upon the qualities of\nthe Servant, but almost wholly upon the\ncharacter of the Master and the Master\nalways has as geed service as he merits. These\ncombinations of smart men and millions of\nmoney have a sorvice power of immense value\nte the people if properly used, or of doing\ngreat harm if net under proper restraint. The\nonly real danger te the people lies in the\nalliance between the Trust with the Machine\nBess and the oily-tongued political demagogue\nthe man we select te make laws for us, who\nhas devoted all his energies te, and has become\nproficient in, the art of getting votes, but\nusually knows little about business and noth\ning about making laws. Let us orase the party\ninsignia by which is only known te which Bess\nwe belong, as we knew by the name of Mellie\nMuggins en the cellar of the pet poodle that\nthe deg belongs te Mellie Muggins.\nLet U3 be independent, let us be men, and\nelect men that are honest and capable te make\nand judge and execute our laws for us,and\nthen the Trusts can de us no harm; they will\nbe our servants, we will be just te them, and\nthey will be just te us; and through the service\nrendered by them the wheels of industry will\nmove as they never have moved before.\nFer the past two years the air has been filled\nwith the talk of the people and the publications\n!A\n"Help!

New, I want te say that rey time is\nmeasurably taken up in attending te my own\naffairs, and I knew but little of the business of\nmy neighbors, and have in my possession but\nlittle data upon which te make a comparison of\npast and present prices. I am able, however,\nte quote some prices of the last five years, and\nsome of an earlier period when we were in the\nhand of the warehousemen and ethers of our\nfriends.\nOne of my neighbers has sold at an average\nof $9.30 for five years, two of the crops net of\ntop quality; several ethers have done about as\nwell. This tobacco when stripped was leaded\nen tbe wagon and delivered te the bujer with\nout further handling or risk of mildew or funk,\nwhich risk was always considerable under the\nold system when the grower of the tobacco\nwas required te put the tobacco in keeping order.\nNew, I will quete some prices of that period\nduring which we are told that the price was\nalways from 10 te 20 cents a pound te the\nfarmer. According te my recollection such to\nbacco as is selling new, and sold one year age\nat 12 cents, sold during the summer of 18S7 at\n12 te 15 cents, or possibly mere per pound,\nbut hew many farmers remember getting as\nmuch as 12 cents that year? I sold at C a crop\nof geed medium quality. My crop was the last\nof a considerable purchase by the shipper te\nwhom I sold, and I get a better price than these\nselling earlier in the season. Much geed to\nbacco left the farmers\' hands at 3i te 4 J cents.\nIt was usually the ether fellow and net the\ngrower who get the high price.\nVe had two grievances at that time, the\nmiddle mm, the shipper who steed between us\nand the warehouse?, and who expected te, but\ndid net always, get a geed slice out of the crop,\nand the warehousemen, who intended te, and\nalways did, get a big tlicc. In \'86 quite a goodly\nnumber of us went around the shipper, prized\nour own tobacco and took it directly te the\nwarehouse. When a farmer came home from\nthe market with the returns en bis crop if he\nget any he looked as if his digestion was com\npletely suspended, and he felt only fit te be hung.\nSuch crops a3 are bringing $12 new sold then\nen the breaks at $5. Deduct cost of prizing,\nshipping and selling, at least $1.50, and we\nhave $3 50 left for such tobacco ai we are sell\ning today at $12.\nIf one wants geed service, the sen er must\nbe treated with justice and consideration, and\nappreciation of the work done must be made\nmanifest. The man who chews and smokes to\nbacco is entitled te have it ceme te him from\nthe producer without unnecessary charges laid\nupon it.\nThe tobacco grower is entitled te all the\nprice for his product that the relatiun of supply\nte demand, with no arbitrary influence, will war\nrant. The only question te be considered in\nestimating the merit of any ge-beUeen the\nproducer and consumer of a product, is, does it\nde the work, and does it de it economically,\nand dees it receive a reward in proportion te\nthe service rendered?\nThe American Tobacco Company is certainly\nwell equipped in every respect for taking to\nbacco from the producer, fitting it for use and\npassing it ever te the consumer, in the best\npossible manner, and at the least possible ex\npense; und I believe and 1 think I hae .is\ngeed reason for believing as these persons\nwho assert the contrary have for their opinion\nthat they are net causing the price of tobacco\nte be lower te the producer or higher te the\nconsumer. 1 be raiser of tobacco in the White\nBurley District are no snch abjects and depend\nents as their would-be guardians would have\nthem appear. They are an independent and a\nmanly set. The elder folks live at case and in\ncomfort. The young people work hard, take a\ngoodly amount of recreation, wear geed clothes,\ndrive geed horses and ride in geed vehicles.\nThey court and get married, and have lets of\nchildren. They make money and save it; they\nare happy and are geed citizens. I doubt if\nthore is in the world anywhere a mere thrifty\nrural people, and they de net need te have any\nbody feeling sorry for them.\nTohaeco Grew br.\nGreen chrysanthemums were exhibited the\nether day at a flower show in Essex, England.\nThe Duke of Manchester has .sold his \'fan\nderagee estate at Armaugh under the Irish land\nact for $1,100,000.\ni&\nIS3\n:\nlit)\n"ft,\n, i, -\nMRS.

Had no appetite and looked\npale and sallow. A friend who had used\nPalne\'s Celery Compound a couple of years\nage, and who recommended it very highly,\nInduced me te try it. I felt better at once\nand I found that at the end of six weeks it\nhad changed me into a well woman, and I\ncannot say tee much in its praise.
