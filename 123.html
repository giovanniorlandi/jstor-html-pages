        <pre>['DENATIONALIZATION 259 \nNoTE.-See, for a similar case, Buisson v. Moses (Gazette du \nPalais, 1948 (ze sem.), p. 109), decided by the Court of Appeal of \nParis on July 23, 1948, where, however, the original tenant, one \nMoses, was presumed dead as the result of his deportation by the \nGerman authorities in 1943, and his widow, who claimed possession \nof the flat as his heir, had acquired French nationality by the time \nthe action was heard. The Court, without deciding the question \nwhether the Allied repeal of German racial legislation reimposed \nGerman nationality upon refugees resident abroad who had been \ndenationalized, held that it could not restore German nationality to \nMoses who was no longer alive at the date of the enactment of the \nrepealing legislation, that his nationality was therefore no obstacle to \nthe bringing of an action by his widow, and that the widow had, \nmoreover, acquired French nationality by naturalization. \nNationality- Loss of- Denationalization- Conclusiveness of Case \nAttorney General\'s Finding as to Status of Enemy Alien-The No. 75 \nLaw of the United States. \nUNITED STATES EX REL. FITTERER V. WATKINS. \nUnited States, District Court for the So路uthern District of New York. \nMarch 16, 1948. \nTHE FAcTs.-Fitterer was a native of Germany. He \nbecame a naturalized American citizen but on March 20, 1944, \nhe was denaturalized by order of the United States District \nCourt for the District of New Jersey, for obtaining his certificate \nof citizenship by fraud. By this order his naturalization was \ndeclared void ab initio and he was discharged without honour \nfrom the Army of the United States on March 30, 1944, as an \nalien. By order dated January 18, 1946, he was found by the \nAttorney General of the United States" to be dangerous to the \npublic peace and safety of the United States because he has \nadhered to a government with which the United States is at \nwar or to the principles thereof". Pursuant to the Alien \nEnemy Act, so U.S.C.A. s. 21 ct seq., Fitterer was interned and \nordered to be removed from the United States. He :1pplied \nfor a writ of habeas corpus, which was refused : he appealed, \nand now applied for bail pending the appeal. \nHeld: that the application must fail; the finding of the \nAttorney General was conclusive and Fitterer must be deported. \nThe Court said : \n" The holding in United States ex rel. Paetau v. Watkins, \n2 Cir., 1947, 164 F. 2d. 457, 1 precludes further consideration by \nthis Court of the question of st2tutory authority for bail on \nappeal in removal and deportation cases and the alleged incon\xad\nsistency between the Paetau case and Carapa路v. Curran, 2 Cir., \n1924, 297 F. 946, 954, 36 A.L.R. 877. \n1 Annual Digest, 1947, p. I35路 \n', 'Case \nNo.75 \nContd, \nCase \nNo.76 \n260 THE INDIVIDUAL IN INTERNATIONAL LAW \n" It is well settled that the findings of the Attorney General \nin such cases are not reviewable in the courts. United States \nex rel. Schlueter v. Watkins, D.C., 67 F. Supp. 556, affirmed 2 \nCir., rs8 F. 2d. 853 ; I Citizens Protective League v. Clark, 8r \nU.S. App. D.C. n6, 155 F. 2d. 290; United States ex rel. \nSchwarzkopf v. Uhl, 2 Cir., 137 F. 2d. 898, 900. 2 Whenever \nwarranted by the facts, relator may be released by administra\xad\ntive action, subject to appropriate administrative safeguards. \nOf the large number of enemy aliens actually subjected to \ninternment, all but a few have been released. While relator\'s \ncounsel refers to him as 1 meek \' and I not dangerous \', this \nCourt has no power to inquire into the truth or falsity of this \nassertion ; and it is largely on the very truth or falsity of \nthis claim that the discretion to grant bail must be exercised. \nIf relator i~ truly a dangerous enemy alien, he should not be \nreleased on bail and no evidence is admissible to impeach the \nfinding made by the Attorney General on the subject." \n[Report: 77 F. Supp. IJS.] \nNationality- Denationalization- Subsequent Annulment of \nDenationalization Decrees-Whether Resultin~ in Restorin~ \nOriginal Nationality. \nIn re SAMOYE. \nArgentina, Camara Civil Segunda. February 20, 1948. \nTHE FAcTs.-The petitioner, a German national of Jewish \nfaith, was deprived of her nationality under Genpan racial \nlaws. These laws were then nullified by the Allied authorities \nin military occupation of Germany. The question before the \nCourt was whether the nullification of the racial laws had \nthe effect of restoring German nationality to persons having \nthe status of heimatlos or apatrides and, thereby, of subjecting \nthese persons to control under the provisions of certain decrees \nrelating to enemy aliens. \nHeld: that the nullification of German racial laws does not \nrestore German nationality to stateless persons who emigrated \nin consequence of these laws. However, the status of hei\xad\nmatlos (stateless) may not be introduced as a demurrer to the \napplication of certain decrees concerning enemy aliens. \n[Report : Gaceta del Foro, vol. 193, p. 124.] \nDenationalization- Repeal of German Denationalization \nDecrees by Allied Control Council in Germany-Effect upon \nFormer German Nationals Resident Abroad. \nSee Case No. 88 (Fretel v.
