I\nIt is cold at Camp Funston. j\nihe thin columns of mercury in\n,the camp thermometers have\nshrunk like an 0- D. shirt after\na trip to the laundry and as any\n| soldier will assure you that’s\nSOME shrinking. Several\ninches of snow have given the\ncity of barracks quite a de\ncorative appearance, and a\npiercing cold wind whistles down\nthe hill and thru the camp\nstreets and makes the camou\nflaging of the board roofs quite\nunappreciated. In short a\nrather belated winter seems to\nbe making up for lost time.\nThe cold snap has shown one\nthing. These boys of the 89th\ndivision are hard, trained to the\nminute, and phyically fit. In\nweather which, as civilians,\nwould have sent them scurrying\nfor shelter, they are carrying on\nthe ordinary business of the\ncamp. Motor truck drivers on\nwhom the transportation of the\ncantonement depends, guards,\non post'at alFhoura of-the-day\nand night, are on duty as usual,\nand no suffering is reported.\nMany patient knitter of a hel\nmet, a sweater or muffler is be\ning mentally blessed however\nthese nights. Its no fun doing\nsentry go at 3A- M. with the\ntemperature where it is, and\nwoolens and knitted things are ,\nlife savers indeed- It will have\nto be bad, bad weather in the ,\ntrenches to make a graduate of\na winter at Funston uncomfort\nable.\nThe cold is all outside. That\nwas provided for months ago\nwhen the huge heating system\nwith it’s 10 central plants, and\nNogales, Arizona, Sunday, January 2d, 1918\nit’s .overhead p.pes, strung on\npoles like telegraph wires, was\ninstalled. It ha|s certainly\nproved itself this time; With\nI plenty of coal on hand, and\ni x ;• *•\n| husky arms behind shovels\njit has kept the barracks far\nj warmer than many city homes.\nAlthough the weather has\nslowed down a lot of the out\ndoor training work, there has\nhas been no let up in the ac\ntivities- Where drilling is ne\ncessary, squadrons Have been\n; cleared. Classes are being held\n[for many, giving the theory of\nthings that will be put into\npractice later. In fact, this\ntime finds the men at a sort of\na half way point in their mili\ntary education. They have al\nready become soldiers. From\nnow on, the higher subjects at\nit were, things brought out in\nthe present war, are given them.\nAnd thru it all runs the athletie\nidea, the competitive scheme,\nengendering a spirit that will be\nhard to beat.\nAn example of this is a game\nrecently introduced by one of\nthe machine gun companies, the\n342 d, in which the rivalry is re\nsulting in pep and speed that\nwill win battles. They run races\nwith machine guns- At a signal\nfrom Capt. Wm Laidlaw, a team\nof two men dash out from one\nline, give a something-orother\non the gun a twist, one man\ngrabs the tripod and the other\nthe gun and off they go for the\nfarther line.

That is but half\nof the trip, though. They take\nthe outfit to pieces once more,\ndash back to their starting point\nand again assemble the gun,\nwhen the captain, with a stop\nwatch notes their time for the\ntrip. The battalion record for\ntaking the gun down, carrying'\nit fifty yards, setting it up, tak-1\ning it down again, running\n* * ’\nft\nRelieved to be Coming to an End.\nanother fifty yards and settim\nit up, is thirty-two seconds\nThink of it, imagine the ad\nvantage of this competitivi\nspirit in a close scrimmage in\nno man’s land—itll wfh the\nfight\nr The presence of instructors\n(. at Funston of French and Brit\n? ish experts in gunnery, bayonet\n. practice and other specialized\n5 branches of warfare, led to one\n. of the odd incidents with which\n. the war is replete. A British\n, lieutenant stood, after mess,\n[ chatting with a French Captain\n> and an American officer, dur\n► ing the conversation the three\n; more or less unconsciously com\n; paring notes. The Englishman,\nit turned out, was a member of\n. one of the oldest of British mili\ntary organizations, the Tenth 1\n; North Lincolnshire Regiment of!\nFoot.. It was that regiment that\ntook part in the historic battles j\n, of Concord and Lexington dur-;\ning the Revolution.\nVery shortly after the of-!\nfScial adoption of the police !\ndogs for the use of the 89th j\nDivision in war work, came the;\npractical need for the animals,\nin which they proved their*\nvalue. It was largely due to the\nactivities of one of them from\nthe kennels of the 353 d regiment\nthat the trail was pointed lead\ning to the uncovering of j\nevidence in the recent tragedy j\nat the Army Bank of Funston,\nin which four men were killed\nwith an axe in the hands of an\narmy captain. Immediately up\non the discovery of the crimgl\nthe police dog belonging to\nCapt. J- C- Maseck, adjutant of\nthe 353 d was sent for. Leading\nCapt« Chas, Smallwood, acting\nprovost marshal, the intelligent |\nanimal pointed a trail that im\nmediately lead to the disclosure!\nof much valuable evidence, |\nwhich later resulted in the 1\nsuicide of the guilty officer.\nThe 353 d regiment now has sev\neral dogs in training in it’s ken\nnels, and a dozen or more are\nreceiving a preparatory eduea* j\ntion in the army work at the!\ndivision kennels on the hill over- i\nlooking the camp. It is an odd i\nfact that two of the most\nvaluable dogs in the service are\nGerman—sheperd dogs of i\npedigree, brought to Funston by <\njSerg. Richard M.

We’ve\ncast old sins behind us, and passing hours remind us\nhow much we miss the same; but we have made our\npledges—none but a piker hedges—and we must play the\ngame. Oh, there are watchers * near us, who do not\nstrive to cheer us, or sootbe us in our woe: our downfall\nthey’re awaiting, and then we’ll hear them prating,\n“There, now! We told you so!” When one has vowed\nto glitter like some angelic critter and hurtful habits\nkill, you’d think his folks would brace him, not pester him\nand chase him, with prophecies of ill. He sees in all\ntheir glances their feeling that his Chances of being good\nare slim; they show by smiles sarcastic, and criticisms\ndrastic, they have no faith in him. And so, grown tired\nof striving, of vows too long surviving, from pledges he\nbreaks free, and while those vows are dying, he hears\nthe women crying, “We knew how it would be!” The\nmonth of January is sad and solemn, very, it is the moon\nof woe; for all the world is saying, to gents from virtue\nstraying, “We told you so!”\n(Copyright 1917 by George Matthew Adams)\no\n“PASS UNDER THE ROD;”\n7 !\n■ ,\nThrough the period of a full generation the American\npeople have gone along from one frivolity to another, from\none fashion to another, piling one extravangance upon\nanother until it has seemed that about all they have lived\nfor has been foolish frivolity, garish display and evsion\nof responsibilities both moral and spiritual. Dancing and\'\ndissipation, card playing and cussedness have been made\nthe chief end of man, with enough grubbing at business\nto keep the play going. And to a great extent that atten\ntion to business has been without equitable conception or\nmoral responsibility. “Get the money” has been the shib\nboleth, and woe to he who cannot get it.\nIn this foolish competition for ease, pleasure, display ,\nand dissipation, there is never ny pause to consider the\ntendency of affairs, or to weigh the meaning of events.\n* Everything, no matter how serious, has to be given an\naspect of amusement or pleasure. In the old fashioned\nagricultural fair, which was instituted to bring together\nthe products of the soil, the shop and the factory to deter\n■ mine excellence and reward superiority the original idea\nhas been lost to sight, and the crowds that flock to see\ngive hours to automobile races, diving girls, parachute\nfights and other frivolities, where they give minutes to\ninspection of the display of the natural resources of a\ngreat state. No function of any kind can be given with\nout a cajjrd game or a dance afterward, and the funeral is\nabout the only public gathering the dance has not invaded. .\nEven now, when the remorseless monster of war is\ndrawing into its cruel and capacious maw the brightest, <\nthe bravest and the best of our population and the hearts\nof mothers are bleeding at the thought of parting with\ntheir loved ones, the boys cannot be given Godspeed and\ngoodwill m their departure for the camp, the field and the\nbattleground, without calling them to “caper to the las\ncivious pleasings of a lute.” Instead of praying them off\nto meet the inhuman horrors of the battlefield we dance \'\nthem off; and we wonder why their mothers join not in\nthe revelry at their departure. How can a woman whose\nheart is breaking look with indifference upon the frivolity i\nof a ball or join in its meticulous measures? What a ]\nhorrible travesty upon human emotion is that which seeks\nto make a playground of a place where the flower of\'\nAmerican manhood is offered upon the altar of its\ncountry!\nAnd to those who look beneath the surface of the cur\nrent of human events there is discernible the determina-!\ntion of a just God to bring to account a frivolous people ]\nwho have ignored responsibility and gone far astray\nHorn the paths of righteousness. Taking into considera\ntion that certainty can one look with hope upon the idea\nadvanced that peace will come shortly? Go to the ah- 1\ncounts m Holy Writ of how God chastened his chosen 1\npeople, and brought them to repentance, and see whether i\nyor can read there that he s]\ntheir idolatry; and then try\nscience with a hope that he\nj pie for sins no more venial.\nNo! The American nai\nmg for the sins of a. stiffn\nand there is no escape.
