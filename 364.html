C, Mar. 23. Imme\ndiately after the senate convened to\nday, Mr. Beveridge renewed his mo\ntion authorizing the appointment of\nconferees on the part of the senate\nto meet the conferees of the house\nof representatives on the statehood\nbill, and Fenator Foraker withdrew\nvhis amendment requiring the submis\nsion of the question of selecting con\nferees to the senate. In making the\nwithdrawal, Foraker stated that he\nhad received assurance from Bever\nidge that the conferees to be sugges\nted by him as chairman of the Com\nmittee on Territories would support\nthe senate\'s position. Beveridge con\nfirmed this statement, and Mr. Lodge\nexpressed the opinion that the sen\nate should always be represented \'in\nconferences . by members designated\nby the committee having in charge\nthe question in controversy, assuming\nthat the conferees will always sus\ntain the senate rather than press\ntheir own views. Senator Teller, on\nthe other hand, contended for the\nright of the senate to select its own\nconferees, regardless of committees\nor the presiding officer.\nA motion to insist on the senate\'s\namendments was then adopted, and\nMessrs. Beveridge, Dillingham and\nPatterson were designated by the\nchair as the conferees on the part of j\nthe senate, the selections being made\nby Mr. Beveridge.\nSenator Morgan secured an order\nfor printing the original and final\ncontract between the United States\nand the Panama Canal Company of\nFrance for the purchase of the canal,\nsaying the contract had never been\nmade public.

An echo of\nthe statehood controversy ofyester\ni day resulted in an effort to correct\nthe journal when the house met \' to\nday. John Sharpe Williams maintain\ned that he was put In the ridiculous\nposition of moving to Instruct the\nconferees after they had been ap\npointed, a motion clearly out of or\nder at that time. The correction, was\nmade as suggested. The legislative\nappropriation bill was then taken up.\n: : o\nW. C. Burrus for Assessor.\nAnother r-\'stIoner for a nomlna\ntioQ st ite fcacsij cf the Chaves coun\nty Democracy Is W. C. Burrus, one\nof Roswell\'s most progressive citi\nzens, who wishes to run for county\nassessor. His announcement appears\nelsewhere. Mr. Burrus bases his\nclaim upon his record during his res\nidence here as a citizen and a Demo\ncrat, and he has a natural claim on\nthe place through his special ability\nin the line of work that is required\nin the office he seeks.\nW. C. Burrus was born in Fulton,\ncounty, Kentucky, in 1859, where he\nlived nntil seven years of age. At\nthat time the family moved to Tenn\nessee, on the Kentucky border, and\nhere he was reared to manhood.\nIn the year 1882 Mr. Burrus moved,\nto SedaliaMo., and after a residence\nof one year there, he was employed\nby the Missouri Pacific railroad, and\nas operator and agent he worked for\nthe company for 18 years. In several\nMissouri, Kansas and Nebraska\ntowns. In 1900 he moved to Roswell,\nand since then his life has been as\nan open book on good citizenship.\nOnly once before coming here did\nMr. Burrus fill a public office. In But\nler, Mo., he was elected alderman\nfrom a strongly Republican- ward by\na majority of forty. Since coming\nhere he has filled one office. He was\nchosen member of the school board\nIn 1903 and two years ago was re\nelected. He is bow serving as secre\ntary of the bord, doing his work\nwith, ability and complete satisfac\ntion. This office expires in April and\nhe is not a candidate for re-election.\nDuring all Hhese years Mr. Burrus\nhas always voted the Democratic\nticket and helped fight the battles of\nDemocracy. He is as strong a Demo\ncrat as can be found anywhere, and\nno one doubts his political position.\nHis early life in Tennessee was\nspent as book-keeper in a large mill\nowned by his brother. His long ex\nperience in railroad work was of a\nclerical nature, and since then he has\nhad much experience in that line.\nFor the work of assessor he is pecu\nliarly well adapted, having a good\nknowledge of values and being a man\nof good judgment and honest convic\ntions. The Democrats have lots of\ngood timber, but none better than\nMr. Burrus. If nominated victory is\nassured.\nMINE EXPLOSION.\nNow Believed List of Dead Will Not\nExceed Ten.\nFairmonnt, W.

The Case Now in the Hands\nof Judge Pope. Another Daughter\nNow at Lakewood.\nSpecial to The Record.\nCarlsbad, N. M., Mar. 23. Mrs.\nMae Aikin. the woman who confessed\nto having buried alive her eight-months-old\nboy near her shack of a\nhome In the Lakewood neighborhood\nearly in January, was today found\nnot guilty by the jury. The jury was\nout less than thirty minutes.\nThe jurymen recognized the plea\nof insanity offered by the defense,\nand the verdict is equivalent to find\ning her Insane. The case is now in\nthe hands of Judge Wm. H. Pope,\nand he will have the defendant com\nmitted to the Territorial asylum.\n. Airs. Aikin is only 26 years of age.\nHer appearance does not suggest in\nsanity in the least, but her act, that\nof burying alive her own child twenty\nminutes after having nursed it, was\nsufficient evidence to the jury that\nher mind was not right. Mrs.- Aikin\nalso has a three-year-old daughter.\nwho is in the care of the deputy sher\niff at Lakewood. The husband of the\nwoman, who had lett ner ana gone\nto his old home at Gate, O. T., was\npresent at the trial. He was held\nblameless by the grand jury.\n, o\nNEGRO HANGED.\nCommitted an Assault on a White\nWoman Last Month.\nPoplar Bluff, Mo., Mar. 23. Curtis\nJackson, a negro, was hanged here\ntoday. He committed an assault on a\nwhite woman in February, and after\nbeing arrested! was nearly lynched\nby a mob that invaded the jail.\nTO FARM THE SWAMPS.\nGreat Government Drainage Projects\nas Weil as Irrigation.\n(By Guy Elliott Mitchell.)\nThe man who can provide homes\nfor the industrious and strong-armed\ncitizens is a benefactor-to the race.\nIf Representative Steenerson, of Min\nnesota, can push his swamp reclama\ntion measure to enactment into a\nlaw, he will be deserving of the\npraise of not only this but future ge\nnerations. His bill is a practical ; ex\ntension of the old homestead idea,\nor rather, perhaps, an application to\nthe vast areas of our swamp lands\nof the idea embodied in the national\nirrigation law.\nThere are in the neighborhood of\n100.000,000 acres f swamp lands in\nthe United States, some 70,000,000\nof which have been surveyed, and\nthe great bufk would make splendid\nfarms if the excess ,of water "were\ndrained off.\nThe - Steenerson5 hill provides for\nthe : beginning of the work of recla\nmation\' of these huge areas. The mea\nsure is framed after the irrigation\nlaw; It provides that the receipts\nfrom the sales of public landa In the\nnon-irrigation states shall constitute\na \'"drainage" fund to be expended by\nthe government in great drainage\nworks, and further, that the cost of\nsuch drainage shall be prorated am\nxng the owners of land benefited and\npaid back by the settlers into the\nfund, to be used over again for addi\ntional reclamation work.\nWould Create Many Homes.\nThis plan of deyeloping the inter\nnal resources of the country and ma\nking homes of waste places, is splen\ndid in its scope, and appears to b\nentirely practicable and profitable.\nTake for instance, the single exam\nple of the swamp lands of the Kan\nkakee River basin in Indiana and Ill\ninois. Here are some 400,000, acres\nof the - very richest of bottom lands,\nbut subject to overflow. They are\nworthless except where they have\nbeen reclaimed through expensive pri\nvate drainage works, when they have\nbecome worth $100 and $150 an acre.\nYet it is estimated by the govern\nment surveyors and engineers that\nthe entire system\' could be effectively\ndrained at a cost in the neighborhood\nof $10 an acre. The same can be said\nof the lands of the Red River Valley\nin Minnesota. These include the fin\nest of grain and farm lands in the\nnorthwest, except that they are fre\nquently overflowed. It would be\nworth millions of dollars to the far\nmers and settlers, who would occupy\nthese lands in small tracts, to have\na perfect system of drainage provid\ned. These extensive systems, howev\ner, especially where they are inter\nstate, seem to be feasible for hand\nlins only by the general government.\nThe : Steenerson bill places the en\ntire management of the work in the\nhands of the reclamation service and\nthe plan of operation follows very\nclosely the irrigation work now be\ning done by that branch of the Inte\nrior Department. Government lands,\nceded Indian lands and private lands\nmay be included in any drainage pro\nject, but in each case, the cost of\nthe drainage improvement is to be\nborne by the owner of the land and\nno settler can have drainage provid\ned for more than 160 acres, thus in\nsnring the division of the tracts into\nsmall farms, which must be actually\nsettled upon and tilled.\nWork Already in Progress.\nThis work the reclamation service\nis qualified to do at this very mom\nent. While primarily an engineering.\nbureau, it has in all its great irriga\ntion projects, to deal directly with\nthe farmer. It must outline\' a compre\nhensive drainage system for each ir\nrigation project, since there is as\nmuch danger from too much irriga\ntion as too little, and to do this the\nservice has its own farm and soil ex\nperts. Some of the irrigation projects\nhave distinctively drainage features,\nin fact are almost as much drainage\nas they are irrigation projects. In\nthe Klamath\' project 136,000 acres,\nor more than half the area of-the to\ntal project, is rich tule land covered\nby eight or ten feet of water, and is\nto be drained and converted into ov\ner a thousand farms. "The topograph\nic branch . of the Geological Survey,\nof which the Reclamation Service is\nalso a branch, has already run, its\nlines over many of the great swamp\nareas of the eastern states, and as\nsoon as the Steenerson bill becomes\nlaw the Geological Survey engineers\nwill be ready to launch out into im\nmediate . activity in drainage " pro-\njectS. !\' -\nWANTED: R.

New York, Mar. 23. The officers\nof the life insurance companies who\ncontributed a portion of the compa\nnies funds to political campaigns.\ncommitted larceny, in the opinion of\nJustice O\'Sullivan, in the court of\nGeneral Sessions. O\'Sullivan express\ned his opinion in court today in re\nplying to a presentment submitted\nto him by the grand jury which is\ninvestigating some phases of the in\nsurance business which were develop\ned by the legislative committee. He\nheld that larceny was committed by\nthe officers who authorized such con\ntributions, and charged the jury te\ninvestigate the responsibility.\nThis opinion is directly opposed to\none on the same subject submitted\nto O\'Sullivan by District Attorney\nJerome several- days ago. Replying to\nJustice O\'Sullivan, Jerome today reit\nerated his opinion that the act of\nthe investigated officials did not con\nstitute larceny, and told the court if\nhe held otherwise he should seek\ncause for indictments against George\nW. Perkins, former vice president of\nthe New York Life, who admitted gi\nving political contributions, and ag\nainst George W. Cortelyou, chairman,\nand Cornelius N. Bliss, treasurer of\nthe National Republican committee.\nJerome said that if O\'Sullivan would\nsit in the case he (Jerome) would\nsubmit affidavits as to the acts com\nmitted by Perkins and ask for war\nrant for his arrest. O\'Sullivan refus\ned to grant the warrant.\no\nFAILED TO APPEAR.\nWitnesses in Standard Oil Case De\nclared in Default.\nNew York, Mar. 23. Henry M. Til\nform and J. C.

Mnations\nfor the different county officers, it\nbecomes necessary to determine whe\nther such nominations should be\nmade by convention or by primary\nelection.\nFor many years I have been oppos\ned to the making of nominations for\ncounty officers by conventions. I am\nj\nGREAT\nStill opposed to that method of mak\ning nominations; and am not only\nin favor of making such nominations\nby primary election, but am in fav\nbr of holding primary elections in\neach ward of the "TCity of Roswell\nwhenever the party , makes nomina\ntions for city officers. Space will not\npermit of a full discussion of the\nsubject; and it seems to me that it\nis perfectly evident that political man\nipulators too often control ajid run\nconventions and thwart the wish and\ndesire of a majority of the democracy.\nTherefore, conventions should not be\nused. By adopting the primary elec\ntion system, the power of the politi\ncal manipulator is minimized and the\nright of the masses of the people\nfreely and untrammeled to express\ntheir preferences is preserved and\nguaranteed.\nAssuming that nominations will be\nmade by primaries, it then become?\nimportant to determine when and un\nder what rules the same will be held.\nSufficient time should be given the\nvoters of the county to discuss the\nmerits and claims of each aspirant,\nand the mode of holding the primar\nies should be such as to guarantee to\neach legal voter the right uninfluenc\ned to cast his ballot for this choice.\nThe dignity of the party and the gen\neral good of the people demand thai\nthe rules governing the primaries\nshould be such as to eliminate all un\nfairness and things sometimes oceur\ning to the discredit of the organiza\ntion. The rule should be such as to\nmake it impossible to vote drunken\nmen, and also to make it impossible\nfor anyone to gather a number ot\npersons together and vote them in\na bunch. To obviate the undesira\nble features above recited, as well as\nothers not mentioned, what is known\nas the Australian ballot system should\nbe adopted. The officers of the demo\ncratic party holding the respective\nprecinct elections should have only\none form of ballot with all of the\nnames of the candidates thereon.arud\nthis ballot should be given to the\nvoters as they vote.
