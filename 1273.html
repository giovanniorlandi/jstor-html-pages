C. Robinson, Editor and Prop., CRESTED BUTTE, - COLORADO, Living Relatives of Washington., Many kindred of George Washing, ton dwell on and about the original, Washington plantation in Westmore, land county, Virginia. John Washing, ton of Brighton parish, Northampton, shire, England, came to Virginia in, 1657 and bought a farm on the Poto, mac river between Bridge creek and, Pope\'s creek, in what was then North, umberland county, but which long,, long ago became Westmoreland coun, ty. He bought the farm from Col., Pope, a great landholder in the early, colonial era, and whose daughter,, Anne Pope, became the wife of the, Immigrant John Washington. These, wore the great grandparents of George, Washington the Great. John Wash, ington, through his marriage to Anne, Pope, obtained lands outside of the, farm purchased by him. The original, farm Is owned by John E. Wilson, who, married Miss Betty Washington,, granddaughter of William Augustine, Washington, a nephew of George, Washington. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are, advanced in years. A score or more, of Washingtons live on their ancestral, lands within rifle shot of the spot, where George Washington was born., 6orae of these people, writes Guy E., Mitchell in Technical World Magazine,, are prosperous farmers and profes, sional men; others are not prosperous., They are all plain and simple folk, who have the good will and respect of, their neighbors. A peculiar thing, about this family is that all its mem, bers have the distinctive Washington, features., It is well not to make faces at or, alighting remarks about persons who, look the part of foreigners. They may, bo subjects of governments that are, touchy. Calling one of the least of, these a harsh name or blfllng him, lightly on the ear may bring on inter, national complications. Some of the, governments that pay no attention to, their subjects when at home unless, they organize bread riots or ask In, low, polite voices for universal suf, frage. get mighty touchy when the, subject has left them for a country, that he thinks he will like better., Then his liberty and pursuit of happi, ness cause much tender solicitude., They may step on him at homo, but, over here they want his rights pro, tected in three languages. Tears well, up in tho eyes of gentlemen whose, breasts look like pawnshop windows, by reason of their display of medals,, while secretly they wish we were so, small that they could lick us. How, ever, there may be more method In, their solicitude than would appear to 1, a person up a tree. If their wandering, boy doesn\'t get a good Job how can ho, continue to send money to tho old, folks nnd thus help to keep down the, poor rates?, In tho annual report made by the, superintendent of prisons of New, York is the suggestion that some per, centage of the money earned by crim, inals be used by the state to support, tho families of these criminals who, may, by tho imprisonment of their, heads, bo rendered destitute. Such a, suggestion is good and practical. The, punishment of the bread winner is apt, to bring want upon the family, but If, a systematized distribution of the, money is made In this manner one of, tho problems met with in dealing wilh, the criminal classes will be effectively, solved., A bill has been Introduced in the, house of representatives providing for, a 25 per cent, rake-off for Uncle Sam, upon every foreign title purchased bv, an American heiress.

Mr. and Mrs. Hubbard, j left on Saturdays train for that, “y. _, As the result of a fight on the, Hid” Friday night, three foreign, ers were brought before the Justice, Court Saturday. They went to Gun, nison Saturday, and each had u, I free meal ticket, good for sixty, days at Sheriff Watsons palace., The local order of the United, Mine Workers of America, gave a, very successful Han! Times dance, Saturday evening, The prizes for, the lady and gentleman wearing, the most appropriate costume, were, awarded to Miss Julia Voss and, John Kozman., The Aspen Tim *s claims that, j the mines in that district will be, working full time and force within, the next thirty days or six weeks., This is owing to the fact that tne, smelting companies have offered to, pay them a bonus for lead ores, 1 which must be had iu order to keep, the furnaces in blast, This is certainly good news to, lead miners, mid it is presumed, 1 that we may expect to receive the, same benefits in this locality as our, mines carry higher percentages in, lead than these of the Aspen camp., Hie production of dry-ores from, ! Cripple Creek and other gold bear, ing quartz camps, will make the, demand greater and imperative for, lead ores, with which to smelt the, siliceous material, common to all, gold mines., John Me Elroy took a force of, miners down to the Crested liutte, C ml CoV hard coal mine last week, and began mining and shipping, coal this week The mine is show, ing a five foot vein of superior, hard coal and is at present looking, better in the main entry than at, any time since the property was, opened. The Young brothers have, the contraet of hauling aud load, the coal on tlie cars, a distance of, soni.\'thiug over two miles from the, mine. It is the purpose of the, company to open this mine up the, coming season in such a manner, as to enable tluui to make a large, production. The railroad will like, -1 ly be extended up to the foot of, the mountain to which point the, coal will be trammed into a break, j er, It is said that the coal mined, litre is much preferred to other, , hard cotd iu this vicinity from the, ; fact that it is more easily ignited, 1 atrl forms less clinkers in stoves, [ Darning it. It is to bo hoped that, | the companys plans can be carriei, foward which will enable them to, employ a large force of men and to, make an output of hundreds of, of tons of coal per day. There is, certainly a greater demand for, hard coal than the present output, of the mines in this vicinity can, supply. The equipping and devel, opment of this propelty will mean, larger payrolls and more perman, ent business for this locality, as, the mine is so located that it can, be worked every day in the year., The Pueblo Fuel Company are, working full force upon their anth, racite property, above town, and, are unable to anywhere near keep, up with orders. This mine is as, yet only in the first stage of devel, opment. Although the vein is small, it appears very regular and but, little faulted thus far. There ap, parently is u large area of coal em, braced in this tract, as also two, or more workable veins in the terri, tory lying toward the west and, north of the main entry and the, coal which is now a semi-anthra, cite should become harder as the, drifting is carried further into the,, mountain where a depth of over a, thousand feet will be had above, tlie coal measures. This company, are working about half time on the, soft coal mine below town, as is, the C. F. AI. property, It is ex, pected that both properties will go, into full production in a short time, or so soon as the metal mines and, smelters are again iu commission, j whicli is believed will be the case, within the next sixty days., It is rumored-that the Colorado, Fuel and Iron people are consider, ing the feasibility of opening up, the Floresta anthracite, so great is, the demand for hard coal., Efforts will be made to drive the, workings of the Smith anthracite, lower vein beyond the block of, crushed coal, which the entry has, been in for some distance., It is thought that this is but a, local condition caused by the hori, zontal or sliding movement of the, roof nud that by drifting good coal, may be found iu a v»ry short dist, ance. The \\t*in is said to have, greuter thickness than the upper, one. operaied twenty years before, becoming exhausted., (continued from first page), working at a profit, for the gold, and silver contained. Among these, may be mentioned the old Loudon, mine, just over the range from, Leadville, and which is now em, ploying twenty tt-ams, hauling ore, !to the rnilrod. Hundred of aban, don\'d prospects which carry good, percentages iu gold, are being look, ed up in every camp iu the stale, * and these will be reopened and, prospected with the result that, many of these can de made to pn), under tlie present facilities for tho, , handling of low grade ores. The, turning districts of Gunnison, county will bear no exception as, I there may be found a greater com, \' plexily of ores here than elsewhere, j in the state and there is scarcely a, vein or a ledge exposed, which dots, not contain more or less gold., It is not doubted that the pre, sent stringency in the metal mar, kets will iu some measure revert to, the stimulating advantage of gold, prospecting all over the mountains, aud that new gold uiiues will be, found and u great many more a, bauded prospects will resume work, and production. There is no better, field anywhere than ig seen here, in Gunnison county, which was, never more tlmn run over in the, days of *79, during their ernze for, silver mines and when the assaycr, was rarely asked to test for gold, \' values. Little or no real system, atic prospecting has ever been done, in the mineralized belts of this, county, although hundreds of well, defined Veins may be found outcrop, ping in the mountains districts., It is thought that the financial, crisis is now passed. It was brought, on through no fault of tne West,, but it is believed that it will bene, fit this country, by attracting capi, tal here for legitmate investment, iu mines and other enterprises., Eastern investors have certainly, hud sufficient of watered stocks and, bonds, for a while at least, if they, will come here they can get in on, the ground floor, organize their, own companies and operate proper, ties themselves., THE PATRONAGE, That You Have Kindly Favored Us, With Is Appreciated, If you arc not pleased with your Purchase bring, back the Gocds and we will Exchange them or Re, fund Your money., A Continuance of your trade is, solicited, with the assurance, that You Cannot Find Better, Stocks, More Satisfactory Ser, vice, or Lower Prices than are at, your command in any one of our, thirty General Stores, located at:, Bcnvin, Cuatro, Engle, Primero, Segundo, Sopris, Stark, ville, Tabasco, Tercio and Trinidad, in I.os Animas Co.
