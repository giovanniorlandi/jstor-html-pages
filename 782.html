The small districts suffered cn\naccount of the disparity of advantages\ncompared with big districts. The big\nschool had all advantage in securing the\nmost competent teachers. The child\nren of small schools have as much right\nto a good teacher as those in the large\nschools. When the law was passed cre\nating a county system, supplanting the\ndistrict system, it was unavoidable that\nthe method of paying teachers would\nbecome a county plan. Hence the pres\nent law giving county boards the right\nto fixfcalaries. The man on the ground\nelected by the people, knows belter how\nto adjust salaries so as to gel results,\nthan can be accomplished under the old\nper capita system.\n"The new law is working well. The\nThe salaries last year were adjusted\nmore equitably and the results were\ngreater and better than ever before The\ntwo great things accomplished aro: The\naddition to the salary fund of the en\ntire Slate, on account of local supple\nmentary aid, of more than a half million\ndollars, and an increase in attendance of\napproximately 50 per cent in the rural\nschools of the State.\n"Rut we have learned some things by\nexperience. Under the new law the\nteacher\'s salary is governed by quality\nof work as well as by quantity of work,\ncondtioned upon the actual attendance in\nschool. It seems by experience that the\nlaw as administered last year is favoring\nthe small district to the detriment of the\nlarge district. This is not the spirit of\nthe law and was never contemplated It\nwas only contemplated that this law\nshould take away from the big district\nits heretofore unfair advantage, but in\nno wise its rights. Ii was never intend\ned that the best teachers should have\ncause under this law to discontinue the\nprofession. Evidently many have. Now\nwhat is the cure for this condition? The\nlaw is all right. The trouble is with its\nadministration. We therefore suggest\nto the Superintendents and County\nBoards the following plan:\n"Make your salary schedule as usual,\nmaking a little diHerence between the\ninitial salary of the teacher in the first\nclass school and the same teacher in the\nsecond-class school, but add a condition\nsimilar to the following: \'Each teacher\nwhose school averages over i forty pupils\nfor the entire term (or whatever number\nmay be selected), shall receive a stated\nmonthly increased in salary, say fifty\ncents, or whatever the local conditions\nmay justify, for each student above forty\nin general average.\' Of course, unless\nthe suggestions may be used to remedy\nthe conditions in your county we do not\nrecommend that they be incorporated\nin your salary schedule. I shall be glad\nto allow your County Board to revise\nyour salary schedule at any time in or\nder to meet the actual conditions in your\ncounty.\n"I repeat again that the spirit of this\nlaw is to give large discretion to the\nCounty Board in the adjustment of\nteachers\' salaries. It is a principal of\nlocal self government that will eventual\nly spring great results in the develop\nment of onr common school system."\nWanted,\nTraveling salesman; oil line. \' Address\nChas. C.

Sud\ndenly a specter appeared before him and\nit was his wife. She said, "Dear, I\ncould not bear to see you so sad and dis\ncontented, so I have come to comfort\nyou. You must not be sad.

Poik Johnson de\nlivered a felling eulogism of Mr. Keller\nwhich brought tears to the veterans\neyes. A letter from Major O. S. Tenny,\nof Lexington, was read expressing his\nregrets on h is inabli\'.y to attend on ac\ncount of illness and adding that "when\nwe shall be called to cross the river and\nrest under the shade of the trees, may\nwe one and all be prepared to train un\nder the Captain of our Salvation, where\nsin and sorrow never come and parting\nis not known." Major Tenny is 93\nyears of age, but still retains his mental\nand to a great degree his physical quali\nties. He is considered Lexingtons grand\nold man.\nIt is sad to think how rapidly Mor\ngan\'s men are passing away. They were\ngreat in war, have done their full duty\nin peace and inspired the world by their\npresence. Wherever bravery, physical\nendurance and good citizenship are men\ntioned, Morgan\'s men will ever be held\nas examples for all of us to emulate.\nPity it is that in the very nature of\ntilings they cannot be with us much\nmuch longer but until they go, may\nevery comfort of life be theirs and then\na heppy reunion with those of their\ncomrades who have gone before where\nthe wicked cease from troubling and the\nwearv are at rest.\nToe New Haven wreck was one of the\nmost disastrous in years, and it appears\nthat it was entirely due to carelessness.\nOne section of a train stopped and an\nother following it lees than a minute be\nhind plowed into the sleepers killing 20\nand injuring 50 or more persons. Or\ndinarily trains do not follow each other\ncloser than ten minutes. Of the killed\nwere Dr. J. B. Marvin, his wife and\ndaughter, Miss Martha. The doctor was\none of the most prominent specialists in\nthe country, whose loss cannot be rilled\nThe New Haven management has been\nin bad order fir years. This catastro\nphe caps the climax and may result in\nplacing the lault with the men higher\nup, instead of as usual on some unim\nportant employee. The wholesale mur\nder calls for prompt investigation and\ncondign punishment.\nAfter repudiating a former interview,\nCaleb Powers, issued a statement from\nWinchester Wednesday that while he\nwas certain he could be renominated, he\nwould not run for. Congress again, inti\nmating that he was out of the political\ngame forever, Mr. Powers treatment\nsince he has been at Washington is not\nconducive of a desire to remain there.\nHa has been ignored and snubbed by\nmost everybody who can see the mark\nof Cian ou his forehead. A partisan\ngovernor relieved Powers of certain pun\nishment for conspiracy to assassinate\nGovernor Goebel, but no earthly power\ncan relieve him of the awful penalty of\na guilty conscience.\nTub government lias heretofore allow\ned to go free of tax the cigars smoked\nby the employees of the factories, but\nthe grant has been so much abused by\nthe giving away of the "free smokes"\nthat Secretary McAdoo has issued an\norder that no employee shall have more\nthan 20 cigars a week that ate untaxed\nand manufacturers are required to keep\na strict account. It appears that the\nDemocratic administration is determin\ned that there shall be no graft anywhere\nbig or little. Such a course is bound to\nmake enemies for it but there is where\nthe people will love it for the enemies it\nmakes.\nThere were 700 entries in the Nebras\nka fair baby show.

Gibson & Co.\nTelephone 500\nThere is a strong effort being made\nto delay action on the currency bill\nwhich the President is so anxious shall\nbecome the law at this session. Senator\nWorks, of Massachusetts, has offered a\nresolution directing the currency and\nbanking committee to prepare and pre\nsent a bill at the December session. This\nwill put the matter squarely up to the\nSenate, where the reactionaries seem in\nthe majority. There is no reason that\nthe bill should not be acted on, and the\nAdministration will fight the resolution\nvigorously.\nSpeaker Champ Clark has been up\nin Maine telling the voters how much\nthe new tariff bill will reduce the cost\nof living. He did his part in putting it\nthrough the House, but the Senate is\ntaking its time in passing the bill. If\n\'twere well to be done \'twere well to be\ndone quickly. Let the poky old Sena\'\ntors get a move on themselves and make\nthe bill a law. If they do not many of\nus will be unable to hold out The high\ncost of living has almost made us reach\nthe jumping off place. \'\nTiiehe must be money in making\nguns and the munitions of war when the\nKrupps, of Germany, can offer the Chi\nnose republic a bonus of fifteen millions\nof dollars cash for the exclusive privil\nege of selling their product in that coun\ntry. By the way. it is said that this\nconcern gets up war scares in order to\nsell cannon, guns, etc. It is now under\ninvestigation by the German govern\'\nmenl on the charge, which if proven\nshould put it out of business.\nProf. T. J. Coates, rural school in\nspector, who recently conducted the\nMadison County Institute, says that he\nfinds that the teachers all over the State\nare very defective in reading and that\nhe will issue a bulletin teaching them\nthe proper way. Bad reading is not con\nfined to teachers. The reading clerks in\nCongress get 110 a day to read bills and\nother papers, but they drawl and drone\nso a Philadelphia lawyer could not tell\nwhat he was reading about.\nCouktt JcrxiK Ralph Gilbert, of\nShelby county, has been to Washington\nand found no evidence that his father,\nthe late Congressman, had received\nmoney from any corporation, or did oth\ner act unbecoming an official.

The\ncrucial and decisive engagement 01\nthe War of 1812 was the battle of the\nThames, fought and won on Canadian\nsoil October 5. 1813. The series of\ncelebrations, which will be held in\nAmerica will close in Louisville, Octo\nber 6. 1913, and Just one hundred\nyears from the hour that Col. Richard\nM. Johnston, afterward Vice President\nof the United States, slew the Indian\nchief Tecumseh, President Woodrow\nWilson will probably be addressing a\ncrowd of 100,000 people in Louisville,\nthe home of many of the troops who\nfought la the battle of the Thames.\nKentucky was assigned the closing\nand choice date of the celebration\nbecause of the distinguished part\nplayed by the Kentuckians in tie War\nof 1812. Kentucky began to play her\npart in the generation before the war\nopened, when she sent Gen. George\nRogers Clark and other Louisville\nsoldiers Into the hostile wilderness\nwhich they wrested from the French\nand Indians and out of which was aft\nrward carved the great States of\nOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and\nMichigan.\nKentucky was the last state which\neould have benefited from the war, In\nasmuch as It was brought about chief\nly by the British impressment of\nAmerican seamen, none of whom\nwere Kentuckians, whereas should\nwar prevail the unfriendly Indians on\nthe frontier of the border states could\nbe expected to commit atrocities from\nwhich Kentucky had already received\nt\'-ie name "Dark and Bloody Ground\nHowever, it was chiefly Henry Clay, in\nthe Kentucky Congressional Delega\ntion that forced President Madison to\ndeclare the second war with Great\nBritain, and Kentucky furnished for\nty per cent of her fighting population\nto go into that war, and at the close\nof the war of the listed dead more\nthan eighty per cent were the names\nof Kentuckians. Kentucky troops to\nman were massacred at the River\nRaisin and again at the first attack-\non Fort Meigs.\nWhen the time came to man Terry\'s\nnew-hewn ships, he selected Kentuck\nians unaccustomed to the motion of\nthe lakes to mount Into the insecure\nrigging and from that vantage point,\nwith their practiced eye and unerring\naim, fired down upon tne British ana\nwon the battle of Lake Erie. Prac\ntically every officer and soldier in the\nbattle of the Thames was a Kentuck\'\nian, excepting alone Gen. William\nHenry Harrison, irho, however, held\nhis commission aa.JklaJor-General from\nthe Kentucky legislature. The charge\nof the Forlorn Hep, about the brief\nest, most terrible and most heroic at\ntack narrated la toe annals of war\nfare, consisted exclusively of Ken\ntucky soldiers whoa nineteen of them\nand their twenty horses went down\nto certain death. It was the Ken\ntucky sharpshooters who are credited\nwith having woa,Xhe battle of New\nOrleans after th wax had in reality\nclosed.\nKentucky proposes to reproduce\nmost of these aoenes of the war of\n1812 In the Louisville celebration. The\nbattle of the Thame win be repro\nduced on land to. "Cherokee Park, to\npographically situated similar to the\nland on which was fought the battle\nof the Thames, and every detail of\nthe sham battle wall be as nearly\nhistorically correct as can be done,\nLouisville will take advantage of her\nmagnificent river frontage In order\nto celebrate suitably the battle of\nLake Erie. The actual battle wIU be\naeplcted In a gocgeoue entertainment\nof fireworks and all morning and all\nafternoon preceding the engagement\nthere will be boat vaces, life saving\nfeats and aquatlo sports. A historical\npageant, depicting various scenes of\nthe war of 1812 will also include\nmagnificent floral parade, such\nmade Louisville ammo us a year .go,\nand will . include elrlc and military\nparades many miles In length.

PERRY\nSilly Season Sensations.\nThis is the silly season, at which the\nsea serpent and other sensational per\nformers have their day. It is appropri\nate that a Congressman\'s denunciation\nof the so-called "slit" skirt as a national\nscandal should be hurled forth at this\ntime of the year.\nLike the cabbage snake and kissing\nbug of other years, the slit skirl is a na\ntional menace that is largely imagina\ntive. An occasional woman who believes\nthat she needs the advertising an ac\ntress of low degree or a woman of the\nlown, or a "fly" girly who has leanings\nin the direction of a disorderly life ap\npears in an indecent costume and is\npromptly arrested. But the slit in the\nskirt of the ordinarily well conducted\nwoman is "rudimentary" like the mus\ncles that wag the human ear, or were\ndesigned to wag it before screens and fly\npaper were invented, and not at all\nshocking.\nThat the dress of women of the period\nis indecent is a standing protest of hu\nman beings of a certain type. It has al\nways been so. According to this class\nthe world has always been headed for\nthe bow-wows as a result of it. But the\nworld, and the women, do not seem to\nbe worse than they were a good while\nago. The national scandal is not mak\ning much headway as au actual national\ncatastrophe.

To offer val\nuable prizes, or to permit such offers\nby newspapers, baby food manufac\nturers, photographers, or others inter\nested in advertising themselves or their\nbusiness, would excite the cupidity of\nparents, cause a scramble for gain in\nstead of a search for knowledge, and en\ndanger and tend to commercialize the\nwhole movement\nThe Babies\' Health Contest at the\ncoming Kentucky State Fair will be in\ncharge of Mrs. John L.
