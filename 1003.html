Now as I have had nearly\n17 years experience in this iminedi\nate section and also fairly well ac\nquainted with the country for some\ndistance round into the adjoining\ncounties, also having taken a trip to\nsouthern Idaho a little over a year\nago.\n:-T,\nMfb\nv\n■\n*. ■\nft\nn\nCHARLES E.

We are not surpassed\nby any section in the Northwest. For\'\nsmall grain no section can surpats|\nus, and in some parts of our country j\ncorn\'does exceptionally well. We al\nso have a wonderful fruit country. j\nVegetation grows to perfection. It is\'\nan ideal timothy and clover country.

We have\nlarge opportunities, and with the in-,\ntroduction and increase of silos our |\nlivestock business is going to grow to\nthe proportions our district warrants.\nAs yet even our farming is not ex\ntensive. We have many square\nmiles not in cultivation, and each\nyear sees many new acres brought\nunder the plow. We have large 1\nareas of rich, fertile land still tim\nbered. and this now affords the best\nof range for our stock. In the pro\ncess of development this land will\neventually be cleared and converted\ninto fine farms; the silo will multiply\nthe feeding capacity of each acre,\nand as time goes on and the country\nsettles up and tilled, our livestock b\nUncle Sam\'s New Ships\nReady For Picked Men,\nthese men recruited. This offers an\nunusual opportunity of advancement\nfor all .men wishing to enter the en\ngineering force of the Navy and all\nmen who have mechanical experience\nin civil life, as all the higher ratings\nare needed at once.\nThe requirements of entering the\n•engineering branch as firemen—the\nlowest rating—is in accord with the\nusual policy of the Navy to give ev\nei y man an equal opportunity for ad\nvancement and all men are advanced\non the basis of their individual abil\nity.\n7\ni\n*\nMen of draft age, to take advan\ntage of this opportunity, must apply\nat once as the next draft Is now at\nhand and after being called by draft,\nour present orders prevent us from\naccepting them.\nM\'EACHBON IN FRANCE.\nLewiston Boy with the U.

They\ndiscover a great truth—that there\nare worse countries than this one.\nThink of a\'region with such won\nderful soil that without rain for a\nperiod of 92 days during the growing\nseason, one can grow such crops as\nour section grew this season! Unus\nual! Yes, such a season of drouth is\nunusual, but our part of Idaho went\nthrough it and produced good crop?,.\nGrain and vegetables planted after\nall rain had stopped and on which\nnot a drop fell until it was harvest\ned, matured and made a creditable\nyield, better than some countries can\nA produce at their best.

I think our land is selling far\nbelow its actual worth, and I want\nmy neighbors to wake up and realize\n| the plain truth about their soil,\n1\nus\nWe who have pioneered and endur\ned the hardships ought: not throw\naway a good thing, just as our coun\ntry is coming into its own.\nshould not get: dissatisfied and sell\nfor half what the same class of land\nin other localities no better situated\nwill cost. I\nA trip to outside points will satis\nfy most of us that we do not recog\nnize a good thing when we have It.\nand we will soon discover that our\nland Is not bringing anything like its\nworth, measured in terms of outside\nland.\nWe\nC E LONG.\nThe Pacific Division of the U.
