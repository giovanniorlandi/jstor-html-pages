Tsirina\n1 \n1Institute of Legislation and Comparative Law under the Government of the Russian Federation, \nCheremushkinskaya str., 34, Moscow, 117218, Russia \nAbstract. The problems of methodology of scientific research activity are \nactual to-day due to discoveries in Physics, Biology and Cosmology Due to \nwidespread international cooperation and advances in the field of genomics \n(especially in sequence analysis), as well as major advances in computing \ntechnology, a «rough draft» of the genome was finished in 2000. This first \navailable rough draft assembly of the genome was completed by the \nGenome Bioinformatics Group at the University of California. The OECD \nProject «Human Genome» is the first experience of application of \nmethodology of scientific research activity based on mathematic modeling \nand cipher technology. The institutions, companies, and laboratories, \nengaged in OECD Human Genome Project, form a system based on laws \nand regulations, treaties and agreements, contracts and regulatory orders. \nThis Model of methodological approach might have been used in other \ninterdisciplinary scientific research activities. The study was carried out \nwith the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research in \nthe framework of research project No. 18-29-14025 on the topic: "Legal \nregulation of genomic research and the use of their results: comparative \nlegal aspect of research». \n1 Introduction  \nThe relevance of the problem of the development of scientific research methodology is due \nto the fact that the humanities, in particular legal disciplines, remain far from the legal \nregulation of the use of the achievements of natural science research. Multidisciplinary \nresearch with a common approach to their legal regulation would help innovation advance \nin various areas of life. Currently, two approaches of research are equally to interesting. \nOne of them is related to the differentiation of scientific disciplines: the infinite expansion \nof specialties, where each field of research is classified as an independent field of specialty. \nThe solution of a scientific problem with this approach comes down to a search in the \ngeneral system of legal regulation of scientific research for a small detail that’s sufficiently \nmodify or amend the law to solve a general problem. \n                                                 \n*\n Corresponding author: gis.doronina@yandex.ru \nE3S Web of Conferences 215, 05008 (2020)\nBFT-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021505008\n  © The Authors,  published  by EDP Sciences.

[1] However, with this approach, the legal regulation of \nresearch remains systematic the rest of the process. [2] At the same time, the general \napproach to differentiating the methods of legal regulation in private and public legal \nrelations retains its lasting value in law. It is this approach that is important in finding the \nright formula for the methodology of legal regulation of scientific research of the human \ngenome. [3] Lawyers increasingly pay attention to such category in law as «value», which \nmeans «objects, phenomena and their properties that are necessary, useful to people and \nsocial groups of a particular society as a means of satisfying their needs and interests, as \nwell as ideas and incentives as a norm, goal or ideal» [4]. The last makes us turn to ethical \nstandards in determining limits in the research of the human genome. \nThe second approach is based on the division of science, taking into account the field of \nknowledge and the increasing importance of interdisciplinary research. When it comes to \nscientific research conducted in parallel in various fields of science, such as biology, \nphysics and medicine, the adoption of legal norms should be very useful when it comes to \nresearch results in related disciplines and the possible legal consequences of using the \nresults. It is important to anticipate at the beginning of planning research work and \nconducting scientific experiments which legal consequences will arise in case of making a \ndiscovery in the field of natural sciences. In the scientific research of the human genome \nthe ban on conducting scientific experiments with the human genome was adopted at the \ninternational level. However, this an approach can also have various legal consequences \nthat will ultimately endanger human life and health.  \nAt first glance, The Human Fertilization and Embryology (Mitochondrial Donation) \nRegulations which was adopted in the UK in 2015, actually lifted the ban on conducting \nexperimental research in the applicability of mitochondrial change technology. [5] The \nresults of advanced research, and mainly the threat of an objective reality that 6,500 \nchildren are born annually in the UK with severe mitochondrial DNA damage, have forced \nto make amendments to existing acts. [6] The form itself of legislation concern to the \ncertain types, and its content the regulations clearly define the limits of scientific research \ndoesn’t allow us to state that there is a change in the general principles of legal regulation \nof scientific research in the field of genetics that established in international law. \n This example above allows to conclude that the adopted general approach to the legal \nregulation of multidisciplinary research at the level of interaction of legal systems \n(international and national, as well as private and public law (within the national legal \nsystem) allows us to provide innovative achievements in various fields science in order to \nimprove human living conditions, and to eliminate the threat to human health \nsimultaneously. Legal problems in connection with the development of science and \ntechnology arise, as a rule, in research activities at the intersection of sciences and in \nensuring the protection of the rights of copyright holders when using (commercialization) \nthe results obtained. [7]  \n2 Materials and methods \nMethodology of the current research paper is consisting of proven general and special \nmethods of scientific knowledge successfully tested in the course of fundamental and \napplied research: \n1. Philosophical method based on dialectical method (of knowledge). This method \nbelongs to the group of general methods. \n2. The formal logic method, which includes analysis and synthesis, induction and \ndeduction, abstraction and collation, analogy and comparison. This method belongs to the \ngroup of general methods. \nE3S Web of Conferences 215, 05008 (2020)\nBFT-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021505008\n2\n', '3. The systemic structural method. This method belongs to the group of general \nmethods. \n4. Historical method. This method belongs to the group of general methods. \n5. The formal legal method of analysis. This method belongs to the group of legal \nresearch methods. \n6. Dogmatic method (studying of legal dogma based on relevant laws). This method \nbelongs to the group of special legal research methods. \n7. Methods of interpretation of the law, which include lexical, systematic, teleological, \ndoctrinal and authentic methods of interpretation. This method belongs to the group of \nspecial methods. \n8. Contents analysis method. This method belongs to the group of expert and \nsociological methods of research and evaluation of received results. \nThe use of philosophical, formal-logical, systemic structural and historical methods was \na requirement for the scientifically proven and methodically verified implementation of \nscientific research. It is impossible to conduct legal research without using the formal logic \nmethod, dogmatic method and method of interpretation of the law. \n3 Results  \nThe result of the application of the complex method of regulation of relations in the field of \nresearch activity has become research projects as a detached complex of normative \nregulation. In law, an integrated approach means various ways of combination private law \nand public law regulation methods of regulation. The legal regulation of interdisciplinary \nresearch is another matter. \nThe existence of two methods in the legal regulation of research activities requires the \nadoption of unified methodology for interdisciplinary research in natural sciences, \nincluding the human genome research. Based on a systematic approach to solving a \nparticular problem, taking into account accepted research methods in any branch of science \nand legal regulation methods, it is possible to plan a scientific search and regulate \nindividual experimental studies in the light of social needs and possible negative \nconsequences. The law allows the creation of special structurally separate areas of joint \nlegal regulation. [8] \nCreating the basis for legal regulation of scientific research requires a deeper \ndevelopment of the methodology of interdisciplinary research. As practice shows, the \nmethodology of legal regulation of interdisciplinary research is based on the interaction of \ntheories in the humanities (for example, sociology and law, economics and law) and \ntheoretical studies conducted at the intersection of the humanities and natural sciences \n(biology, physics, chemistry), for example, biology and law. At the intersection of the \nhumanities and the natural sciences, new theories are created and that) explain the already \nwell-known facts in a new way. So, for example, along with the development of research \non the human genome, environmentalists (proponents of environmental protection) \napproach denies the possibility of presuming human’s biological nature. In interdisciplinary \nscientific research, it is allowed to study the interaction of various theories. \n4 Discussion \nThe theory of «rational» in the general theory of law allows to cover all branches of \nknowledge with a single research methodology. [9] Rationalism is an evaluation of \njudgments and actions in term of rationality, logic, prudence, expediency, efficiency, \neconomy. The reference point of a scientific discussion about legal value in the light of new \nE3S Web of Conferences 215, 05008 (2020)\nBFT-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021505008\n3\n', 'paradigms is the thesis that «post-non-classical scientific rationality» actualizes the appeal \nto a person as a subject of law, and, consequently, to the value component of his activity. \n[10] The question of methodology is to highlight what the value component of research \nactivity is and when it is based on the widespread use of computer technology.[11] \n«Digitalization», or the comprehensive entry of computer technology in any field of \nactivity, is even more successfully transforms science into a productive force. The research \nof a person as a special type of activity, is aimed at the production of new knowledge. At \nthe same time, it is necessary to take into account that, interacting with other forms of \nactivity, the scientific field is constantly changing interacting with other forms of activity. \n«It testifies about the historical variation of the scientific activity itself». [12] \nInteraction at the level of scientific theories provides ample opportunities, because \nscientific theory is a tool to predict the course of events occurring in reality. However, such \na limited understanding of the role of scientific theory in solving a particular problem does \nnot allow to determine which the path to cognition of reality should be. Besides, it seems \nimportant not only to formulate a scientific theory that predicts the course of reality, but \nalso to plan experimental activities that confirm or disprove a particular theory or \npredictions put forward in accordance with the proposed scientific theory. All of this \nemphasizes the importance of developing a methodology for the legal regulation of \nresearch activities. \nScientific researches include two different types of activity: theoretical substantiation of \nreality and experimental confirmation of theoretical assumptions. For the legal regulation of \nnatural science research, the distinction between the two types of scientific activity is \nparticular important. It is important for determining a particular form of legal regulation of \nscientific research as a specific type of activity, taking into account the specifics the object \nof regulation. If the object of scientific research is clearly defined, the decision to carry out \nthe corresponding work will largely depend on the choice of the method of research \nactivity. The challenge lies in the fact that the subject of scientific research coincides with \nthe object of study. Human, as an object of research, is a terra incognita as the cosmos, \nsocial community, and also the origin of life on earth are the same unexplored objects. In \nthis case, special requirements may be submitted to the research methodology in the form \nof an experiment. The methodology for the interaction of scientific theories in the field of \ninterdisciplinary research can play an important role. \nThe feature of the legal regulation of natural science research is that for them the main \nsource of law is a law based on the principles of international law, which are is based on \nethical rules. In the field of physics, there are the rules for preserving life on earth in \ninternational disarmament treaties, as well as the problems of war and peace solved in \ninternational law; in biology there are questions of removing the threat to human life. An \nexample of a possible threat is a worldwide pandemic caused by an influenza virus, \nprobably obtained by artificially. [13] \nEthical or moral rules, as the basis of the legislation of an individual state, is part of the \nphilosophy of law and serves as the basis for the formulation of the norm on the permission \nto conduct any scientific research in any science. It defines the rules of human behavior \nwho is an active participant in this activity. The appeal to philosophy, of which ethics is a \npart, is not accidental. Considering a person as a subject of scientific research in the field of \ngenomic research, it turned out to be especially important to establish certain boundaries of \nhuman actions in this research, given that he is also an object of scientific research. \nCurrently, solution of such global problems as the appearance of life on planet Earth, \npossibly on other planets, the evolution and origin of living organisms on earth, the theory \nof the appearance of the Universe, etc., has become relevant. «Living in this vast world, \nwhere good and evil alternate, people, peering into the vast sky, asked themselves a lot of \nquestions». [14] The answers to such questions could be given not by one special field of \nE3S Web of Conferences 215, 05008 (2020)\nBFT-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021505008\n4\n', 'science, but by science as a whole. [15] Participation in the genomic research of specialists \nfrom various fields of science is a feature of this field of research and it should be taken \ninto account when developing national legislation on scientific research activities in the \nstudy of the human genome. \nNational legislation should reflect the need for development of unified methodology for \nmultidisciplinary research and determine the ways and prospects for its use. As early as the \nbeginning of the 20th century, during the heyday of racial theories and national socialism in \nGermany, major philosophers noted:  «Scientific fields are far removed from each other. \nThe way they develop their items is radically different. Today, this disintegrated variety of \ndisciplines is somehow held together only by the technical organization of universities and \nfaculties and retains some significance only because of the practical purpose goal-setting of \nindustries». [16] \nEthics is not a direct source of law, but it helps to eliminate doubts in setting the \npurpose of the research «We suppress our doubts and follow the majority, because we \ncannot imagine ourselves as pioneers propagating unknown difficult truths».[17] Ethics \ndirects the experimental activities of scientists specializing in genomic research in biology. \nFor interdisciplinary research, such as research in experimental biology, research results \ncan be achieved by referring to the science of all sciences – philosophy. «Each society has \nits own rules that determine what to believe in and how to behave so as not to be suspected \nand condemned. Sometimes such social convention receives strict wording in the code of \nlaws, sometimes it is a collection of intuitive ethical and practical norms, called «common \nsense», which dictates what should be worn, how to manage finances, whom to respect, \nwhich etiquette rules to follow, how to organize your home life. Doubts in these findings \nseem strange, even unsafe». [18] \nThe above quote emphasizes the role of philosophy in the human’s possession of the art \nof living. It is this quality that is required from scientific research of the human genome – in \nthe name of human life, to eliminate the possibility of irreparable harm to humanity as a \nwhole. In philosophy, we draw on the basic principles of legal regulation, which are \nenshrined in international legal documents. As for the legal regulation of specific relations \npresented in national legislation, it should take into account the features of scientific \nresearch as a specific type of human activity, in which a person is both an object and \nsubject of scientific research. \n5 Conclusion \nThe legal regulation of scientific research of the human genome takes are in the light into \naccount of all the possibilities of specialization and cooperation of scientific research, not \nonly in the natural sciences, but also in the cooperation of natural and humanitarian \nresearch. In law first of all attention should be paid to new models of cooperation of \norganizations of various functions involved in genomic research. \nIn the field of law, the specialization of certain legal entities is largely determined in \naccordance with the method of legal regulation: public-law or private-law regulation of the \nsubject of relations arising from the implementation of a particular activity. When \nanalyzing the national legislation of various states regarding scientific research of the \nhuman genome, attention is drawn that in the field of public law relations, state bodies \nexercise control over the practical activities of organizations involved in scientific research. \nIn private law regulation, the subject matter is commercial contracts concluded in \naccordance with the free will of the participating parties. In the legal regulation of scientific \nresearch of the human genome, it is impossible to avoid the advantages that cooperation \nbetween organizations with various functions (control or entrepreneurship) provides. As a \nE3S Web of Conferences 215, 05008 (2020)\nBFT-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021505008\n5\n', 'rule, such cooperation between business and government becomes punishable, at least by \nantitrust laws that monitors competition in the public interest. \nAs the results of genomic research show, the natural sciences have already developed \ntheir own methodology, which has the character of universal application, which can have an \neffective impact on the development of a methodology for the legal regulation of genomic \nresearch. «In the history of science, we observe a sequence of ever-improving theories, or \nmodels of the world: from Plato to Newton’s classical theory to modern quantum theories». \n[18] In scientific studies of the human genome, as in quantum physics, the researcher has \nobjects of observes objects that «do not even exist on their own, but exist only as part of an \nensemble». [18] \nResearch in the field of natural sciences of lots of invisible objects (quanta, genome, \nelectron and atom) due to the modeling of a certain world in which these objects exist. «We \ncreate models in science, but also create them in everyday life. Model-independent realism \nis applicable not only to scientific models, but also to conscious and subconscious mental \nmodels that we all create in order to interpret and understand everyday life». [18] In the \nfield of observing invisible objects, built models of physical objects are the reality that \nbecomes part of fundamental research. This is shown by modern British physicists S. \nHawking and L. Mlodinov, who proposed their universal M-theory of creation of the world. \nAccording to them, the significance of the theory of model-dependent realism can be \ndemonstrated by the example of a model of the existence of a subatomic electron particle. \n«The electron was discovered in 1897 by the British physicist J.J. Thomson (1856 - 1940) \nfrom the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. He conducted experiments with \nelectric current inside empty glass tubes – this phenomenon is known as cathode rays». \nThomson’s guess that the cathode rays he received were made up of tiny corpuscles was \nunambiguously confirmed by experience, although about electrons (material elements of \natoms considered at that time) indivisible and were not known. Subsequently, the proposed \nmodel of the existence of electrons has shown «its indispensability in everyday use – from \nfundamental science, to engineering projects». \nAccordingly, the so-called unified approach to the methodology of scientific research is \nhas currently been) formed by constructing and analyzing mathematical models to predict \nthe development of a particular phenomenon. This direction in research activity has a \ncertain methodological feature. Mathematical modeling, or a unified scientific approach to \nresearch, ensures the effectiveness of scientific research in the field of both natural and \nhuman sciences.  \n \nThe study was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research in \nthe framework of research project No. 18-29-14025 on the topic: "Legal regulation of genomic \nresearch and the use of their results: comparative legal aspect of research». \nReferences \n1.
