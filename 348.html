Commissioner,\nni', 'A Splendid Lecture«\nPresident Christensen of Ricks\nAcademy at Rex burg, stopped here\nlast Saturday on his way home from\nParis, where he had been to deliv\na lecture before the students of\nFielding Academy. As he had\nremain here oyer night he kindly\nconsented to lecture at the L. D. S.\nmeeting house in the evening. His\ncoming was not very well adver-\'\ntised and consequently he was not\ngreeted with a very large audience.\nThose present, however, were well\npaid for attending. Mr. Christen\nsen\'s talk was along educational\nlines, and he impressed upon the\nyoung people the great value that a\ngood education is to them in life.\nThe tendency of the present age, he\nsaid, was the desire of young people\nesneniall^ u , ( \'\nespecially ot boye, to quit school for\nthe purpose of earning a few dollars.,\nThis is true, he said, even among\ner\nto\nthe children whose parents\namply able to keep them in school.\nOnce out of school, the many who\nnever return, go through life with\ntheir mental faculties dwarfed and a\nlarge per cent of them are not able\nwere\nto earn any more wages after they\ngrow to manhood than they did\nwhen they quit school to earn their\nfirst dollar. Opportunities are al\nways open for men of education to\nfill positions at salaries that will in\na few years repay them for the time\nand money spent in securing then\neducation. i\nMr. Christensen is an entertain\ning talker and convinces his audi\nence that he is deeply in earnest in\nwhat he advocates.

Such intèrference was condemned in the\ndemocratic national and state platforms and the anti-church\ninterference resolutions in both instances were the handi\nwork of Senator Dubois and aimed at the Mormon church.\nIt was alleged during the campJfgn that the politics of\nthis state are conti oiled and dictated by that church; that the\nlegislature was controlled by it, and that even a United\nStates senator was elected by church influence. These alle\ngations were made to make it appear that the Mormon\nchurch is the only organization in the United States which\nteaches the doctrine of superiority of church over state and\nof the subserviency of state agencies to the purposes of\nchurch government; that the Mormon church compels its\nmembers, or to put it mildly, urges its members to band to\ngether on issues affecting or which may affect them, in utter\ndisregard of party obligations, and on all occasions and in all\nofficial political callings to hold themselves in readiness to\ndo the bidding of thé church. Such radicalism was declared\nto be inimicable to the interests of good government and had\nfor its object the ultimate subjection of political agencies to\nchurch interests as against all that may be in opposition to\nthe church. In view of this position, which, while untruth\nful and false, may for arguments sake be assumed to be cor\nrect, we wish to quote from the writings of a very learned\ncatholic writer, Anatole France, and from Osservatore\nRomano, the official organ of the Pope, as to the position\ntaken by the Catholic church as to politics, arid to inquire\nwhether Dubois ought not also to have included as enemies\nof the republic, the Catholic church and its members and not\nlaid all the blame for such doctrine at the door of one church\nto show its absolute unworthiness of toleration.\n* t\nIn this nation, by reason of its constitution and. the in\ntent of its creation, it is generally conceded by all fairmind\ned citizèns that church and state must be separate and must\nbe kept separate, and that principle is correct. This coun\ntry is a land of freedom of religious conviction and of relig\nious worsnip, and no church, however small, should be at anj T\ndisadvantage through political power exercised against it by\nany other such organization. Churches should stand upon\ntheir merits, unhampered and without oppression and with\nequal rights before the law and no church should control the\nstate. But Dubois and his co-workers said that the conti*ol\nI\nof the state by the Mormon church was apparent, as if this\nevil is one for which that church, among all churches in the\nworld, is responsible. Following is the statement of Catholic\nbelief by Mr. France:\n"Whether the Roman church now possesses a territorial domain or\nShe is a temporal Power, dis\nsimply dwells in a palaoe, she is a state,\ntmguished from the Powers with which she negotiates in that the latter\nhave set houndries to their sovereignty, whereas the church can recognize\nboundries to her sovereignty without repudiating her origin, changing\nIn opposi\nno\nher nature, without betraying herself, contradicting herself,\ntion to other powers, which, because their feet rest upon that which is\nhuman, recognize the conditions which man and nature impose upon them\nby subordinating their will, their disposition, and their laws to the force\nof circumstance, the church must not yield any of her power, which as\ngiven to her as a sacred bequest. Nor should\nshe always teaches, was\nshe yield rights which she professes to have received from heaven.\n"The very nature of this institution, as the church expounds it to\ninvests her with civil and political authority over the whole world.\nBecause she is a spiritual power, she is a temporal power.\n"The church makes it her mission to save the world, and to this end she\nhas set forth rules of life\nus,\nAgain:\nhas prescribed certain formulas and customs,\nfor the union of sexes, tor food, days of rest, feasts and education of\nchildren, the right to write, speak and think. To make sure of the car\nrying out of these rules — which, so far from affecting the purely spiritual\ndomain only, come to a great extent within the police power of the state\n—the church must exercise a Tight of control over the government of all\nnations and hence must assume a place in the government of all people."\nAs to the relations which should subsist between church\nand state the Osservatore Romano says: "Separation of the\ntwo perfect societies, constituted such by r God, is a monstros\nity, and to this monstrosity the church cannot adjust herself\nin Catholic states and has to combat it." She is combatting\nwhat she calls the monstrosity in France at this time.\nAgain the same paper says: "Freedom of the press is\nan error condemnable and condemned. It is contrary to\nsense in philosophy, and in theology a monstrosity, in the\nsame manner as freedom of worship and of conscience and\nof thought.\nThe above quotations were taken from the Literary Di\ngest (Nov. 19th, 1904) a non-partisan, non-religious publica\ntion of the highest authority.\nAre not our institutions in imminent danger, if the above\nrepresents Catholic doctrine correctly, and would it not be\nwell for these guardians of our political liberties, such\nDubois, to look to the annihilation of the Catholic church\nwell as to the Mormon church? The fact is, as we believe,\nthat the American people are too wise, too liberal, too loyal\nto the principles of religious and political equality that\nneither the Mormon nor the Catholic church will ever be\nable to shape the destiny of this great nation by dictation\nany manner of intrigue. If there come a time when one\nthe other, through its meritorious tendencies and results so\nconvinces the people of the nation that it has superior stand\ning in the sympathies of the people, it may transpire that\ngreat Mormons or great Catholics may receive important\npolitical consideration in the nation, but not with an intent\nthat they shall legislate or influence legislation lo crush out\nor restrict the civil, political or religious rights of other cfe\nnominations. The cry of "church influence\nis simply a hoax, for a free people will never consent to\npression nor sanction the oppression of others.\n5?\nas\nas\nor\nor\n»1\nin this country\nop\nIdaho is doing pretty well at the St. Louis fair. The\nstate building won second prize, and our agricultural exhib\nit carried off the highest honors.\nThe awards have not yet\nbeen announced on the horticultural exhibits, but it is safe\nto say that Idaho will come in for a share of the honors in\nthat class. The free advertising that the capturing of these\nprizes will give to the state will result in great good, and be\nthe means of attracting capital and a desirable class of people\nhere. Idaho is rapidly forging to the front,\nchurch influence,\nin spite of\n»? t.\npolygamy,\ntt\nMormon hierarchy,\nthe attendant curses upon society, of which we heard so much\nduring the recent campaign. We think that Idaho is doing\nI remarkably well abroad for a state that is "blighted" as Mrs.\nWhite, Rev.
