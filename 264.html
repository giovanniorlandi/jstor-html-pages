Here are\na few facts and figures: The high\nschool district at Rigby had the\nsmallest per capita cost, which was\n$74.79 for the nine months.\nThe\ncost at Weiser was $252 per capita.\nBlackfoot spent $108; Idaho Falls.\n$126; Boise, Caldwell and Nampa,\neoch a little over $108; and Buhl\n$139. The cost in Oakley Rural\nhigh school district Is very likely to\nfall below Rigby\'s last year figures.\nThe greatest item of expense, as\npointed out by Commissioner Bryan,\nis that of teacher service.\nBoise,\nCaldwell and Nampa each had, last\nyear, one teacher for every 20 pu\npils; Weiser had one to every seven,\nwhile Payette had the fewest, or one\nteacher loevery 27 pupils. At the\npresent time our local school has\n160 students and five (or the equal\nof full time of but five) teachers; :\nthis is one teacher to every 32 stu-J\ndents. In other words, we have j\nfewer teachers per student than ;\nany high school in the state had last\nyear.\nWith the increasing enrollment,\nwe epect to have much the largest\nrural hifeh school, the cheapest in\npoint of per capita cost and one of\nthe very best in quality of work\nin the state.

There was nothing he could\n«o about It\nHe went to Ell Fredenberg. "What\n(has Davis done to you?" Samson\nked, recalling where he had met Eli\nat morning.\nEll explained that he had borrowed\nponey from Davis to tide him over the\n(hard times and was paying 12 per\ncent for It.\n"Dis morning I get dot letter from\nbis secretary," he said as he passed\na letter to Samson,\nIt was a demand for payment In\nthe handwriting of the Brlmstead note\nand had some effect on this little hls\ntory.

The\nfair Annabel, knowing not the power\nthat lay In her beauty, had captured\nhis young heart scarcely fifteen years\nof age. He had no Interest In her\nyounger sister, Mary. But Annabel,\nwith her long skirts and full form and\nglowing eyes and gentle dignity, had\nstirred him to the depths. When he\nleft he carried a soul heavy with re\ngret and great resolutions. Not that\nhe had mentioned the matter to her or\nto any one.\nfor speech,\nhe spoke of it, but to no other.\nHe asked to be made and to be\nthought worthy. He would have had\nthe whole world stopped and put to\nsleep for a terra until he was delivered\nfrom the bondage of his tender youth.\nThat being Impossible, It was for\nhim a sad, but not a hopeless world.\nIndeed, he rejoiced In his sadness. An\nnabel was four years older than he.\nIf he could make her to know the\ndepth of his passion, perhaps she\nwould wait for him. He sought for\nself-expression in The Household Book\nof Poetry—a sorrowful and pious vol\nIt was a thing too snored\nTo God, In his prnyets,\nume. He could find; no ladder of\nrhyme with an adequate reach. He\nendeavored to build one. He wrote\nmelancholy verses and letters, confess\ning his passion, to Annabel, which\nshe did not encourage, but which she\nalways kept and valued for their In\ngenuous and noble ardor. Some of\nthese Anacreontics are among the\ntreasures Inherited by her descend\nants. They wore a matter of slight\nImportance, one would say, but they\nmark the beginning of a great career.\nImmediately after his return to the\nnew home In Springfield, the boy,\nJoslah, set out to make himself hon\nored of his Ideal. In the effort he\nmade himself honored of many. His\neager brain had soon taken the footing\nof manhood.\nA remarkable school of political\nscience had begun Its sessions In the\nlittle Western village of Springfield.\nThe world had never seen the like of\nIt. Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A.\nDouglas, E, D. Baker, O. H. Browning,\nJesse B. Thomas, and Joslah Lambom\n—a most unusual array of talent as\nsubsequent history has proved—were\nwont to gather around the fireplace In\nthe rear of Joshua Speed\'s store, eve\nnings, to discuss the Issues of the\ntime. Samson and his son Joe came\noften to hear the talk. Douglas looked\nlike a dwarf among those long-geared\nmen. He was slight and short, being\nonly about five feet tall, but be had a\nbig, round head covered with thick,\nstraight, dark hair, a bulldog look and\na voice like thunder. Douglas and\nLincoln were In a hedged\nover the admission of slavery to the\nterritories the first night that Samson\nand Joe sat down with them.\n"We didn\'t like that little rooster of\na man, he had such a high and mighty\nway with him and so frankly opposed\nthe principles we believe In. He was\nan out-and-out pro-slavery man. He\nwould have every state free to regu\nlate Its domestic institutions, in Us\nown way, subject only to the Constitu\ntion of the United States. Lincoln\nheld that It amounted to saying That\nIf one man chose to enslave another\nno third party shall be allowed to ob\nject.\' "\nIn the course of the argument Doug\nlas alleged that the Whigs were the\naristocrats of the country.\n"That reminds me of a night when\nI was speaking at Havana," said Hon\nest Abe. "A man with « ruffled shirt\nand a massive gold watch chain got\nup and charged that the Whigs were\naristocrats. Douglas In his broad\ncloth and fine linen reminds me of\nthat man. I\'m not going to answer\nDouglas as I answered him. Most of\nthe Whigs I know are my kind of\nfolks. I was a poor boy working on\na flatboat at eight dollars a month\nand had only one pair of breeches and\nthey were buckskin. If you know the\nnature of buckskin, you know that\nwhen It Is wet and dried by the sun It\nwill shrink and my breeches kept\nshrinklng and deserting the sock area\nof my legs until several Inches of\nthem were bare above my shoes.\nWhilst I was growing longer they\nwere growing shorter and so much\ntighter that they left a blue streak\naround my legs which can bt; Been to\nthis day. If you call that aitstocracy\nI know of on» Whig that Is an aristo\ncrat"\n"But look at the New England type\nof Whig exemplified by the Imperious\nand majestic Webster," paid Douglas.\n"Webster was another poor lad."\nLincoln answered. "His father\'s home\nwas a log cabin In a lonely land until\nabout the time Daniel was born, when\nthe family moved to a small frame\nhouse. His Is the majesty of a great\nIntellect."\nThere was much talk of this sort\nuntil Mr. Lincoln excused himself to\nwalk home with his two friends who\nhad Just returned from the North, be\ning eager to learn of Samson\'s visit.\nThe latter gave him a full account of\nIt and asked him to undertake the col\nlection of Brlmstead\'s note.\n"I\'ll get after that fellow right\naway," said Lincoln. "I\'m glad to get\na chance at one of those men who\nhave been skinning the farmers."\nThey sat down by the fireside In\nSamson\'s house.\n"Joe has decided that he\nbe a lawyer," said Samson.\n"Well, Joe, we\'ll all do what we can\nto keep you from being a shotgun\nlawyer," Abe Lincoln began. "I\'ve got\na good first lesson for you. I found It\nIn a letter which Rufus Choate had\nwritten to Judge Davis. In It he says\nthat we rightly have great respect for\nthe decisions of the majority, but that\nthe law Is something vastly greater\nand more sacred than the verdict of\nany majority. \'The law/ he says,\n\'comes down to us one mighty and\ncontinuous stream of wisdom and ex\nperience accumulated, ancestral,\nwidening and deepening and washing\nItself clearer as It runs on, the agent\nof civilization, the builder of a thou\nsand cities. To have lived through\nages of unceasing trial with the pas\nsions, Interests and affairs of men, to\nhave lived through the drums and\ntrampllngs of conquest, through revo\nlution and reform and all the changing\ncycles of opinion, to have attended\nthe progress of the race and gathered\nunto Itself the approbation of civil\nized humanity Is to have proved that\nIt carries In It some spark of Immor\ntal life.\' "\nThe face of Lincoln changed ns he\nrecited the lines of the learned and\ndistinguished lawyer of Massachu\nchusetts.\n"His face glowed like a lighted lan\ntern when he began to say those elo\nquent words," Samson writes In his\ndiary. "He wrote them down so that\nJoslah could commit them to memory."\n"That Is a wonderful statement,"\nSamson remarked.\nAbe answered : "It suggests to me\nthat the voice of the people In any one\ngeneration may or may not be In\nspired, but that the voice of the best\nmen of all ages, expressing their sense\nof Justice and of right, In the law. Is\nand must be the voice of God. The\nspirit and body of Its decrees are as\nIndestructible ns the throne of Heaven.\nYou can overthrow them but uiftll\ntheir power Is re-established, ns surely\nIt will be, you will live in savagery."\n"You do not deny the right of revo\nlution."\n"No, hut I can see no excuse for It\nIn America. It has remained for us\nto add to the body of the law the Idea\nthat men are created free and equal.\nThe lack of the saving principle In the\ncoties of the world has been the great\ncause of Injustice and oppression."\nHonest Abe rose and walked up and\ndown the room In silence for a mo\nment. Then he added :\nsaid: \'We should beware of awaking\nthe tremendous divinities of change\nfrom their long sleep. Let us think\nof that when we consider what we\nshall do with the evils that afflict us.\'"\nThe boy Joe had been deeply In\nterested In this talk.\n"If you\'ll lend me a book, I\'d like\nto begin studying," he said.\n"There\'s time enough for that," said\nLincoln. "First, I want you to under\nstand what the law Is and what the\nlawyer should be. You wouldn\'t want\nto be a pettifogger. Choate Is the\nright model. He has a dignity suited\nto the greatness of his chosen master.\nThey say that before a Justice of the\npeace. In a room no bigger than a\nshoemaker\'s shop, his work Is done\nwith the same dignity and care that\nhe would show In the supreme court\nof Massachusetts. A newspaper says\nthat In a dog case at Beverly he\ncapacity for work,\nthe peroration of his speech In de\nfense\nand the crabbed old squire with the\nconsideration due a chief Justice."\n"He knows how to handle the Eng\nlish language," Samson observed.\n"He got that by reading.

There\'s\na lot of work ahead of you, Joe, before\nyou are a lawyer, and when\nyou re\nadmitted success conies only of the\nBrougham wrote\nof Queen Caroline nineteen\ntimes."\nT want to be a great orator," the\nboy exclaimed with engaging frnnk\nness.\n\'Then you must remember that\ncharacter I« the biggest part of It,"\nHonest Abe declared. "Great thoughts\ncome out of a great character and\nonly out of that. They will come\neven If you have little learning and\nnone of the graces which attract the\neye. But you must have a character\nthat Is ever speaking, even when your\nUps are silent. It must show in your\nlife and fill the spaces between your\nwords.
