SATURDAY, JUNE 29, 11)07.\nNUMBER 8.\nThe Mysterv\nOF:\n.Carney-Croft\nBy\nJOSEPH BROWN COOKE\nfk (UoprRfkt, ism, bj Stoxr-i\'rsM Corporation.)\nCHAPTER VII.\nA Misplaced Joke.\nTho door was securely looked and\n- bolted ;n tho inrldo, as I had loft It\ntho olgbt before, and a nnt thor\nns\' Quga searcn uisoseu no ouier, uoor\n\'h opening Into tho room, and no pos\nsible place of concealment for any-\njgf thing of tho bulk of a man.\nino uiougni oi u concoiuou opening\nin tho celling over the bed naturally\nsuggested Itself to my mind, but noth\ning of the sort existed nnd a moment\'s\nexamination with a towel on tho end\nof a walking stick showed a layer of\ndust which evidently had not been dis\nturbed for years.\nIn short tho presence of tho envel\nope on my bod seemed to bo shrouded\nIn mystery of tho most Impenetrable\nkind: but oven It was exceeded In\nIts Incomprehensibility by the aston\nIshlng contents of tho note.\nMy lovo for Florenco\' Carney was, I\nhad thought, a secret burled deep In\nmy own breast. Surely I had never told\n! It In all tho years that I had cherished\nit so fondly, and, on one occasion at\nWipicast, I had denied it flatly. Yet It was\nrien . . . . , . ...\nK mentioned Jiero, in as maucr-or-ract a\nTO way is If our engagement had been\nciurqj? lormany announceu ana our weuuing\nMm day named.\namrinrw - ...\nmr"- turnca tno matter over ana over\nIn tho winding road that led to Hos\nkins\' hotel, but I was no nearer a so\nlutlon of tho problem when I finished\nmy breakfast than I had been when I\nleft tho house. There wero a number\nof letters for mo at tho post office, but\nI had no Interest In thorn, and, stuff\'\nlng them unread Into my pocket, 1\nwandered back to Carney-Croft, still\npondering deeply.\nUnlocking tho door, I returned at\nonco to my room and ngaln mado a\ncareful search for any possible means\nof Ingress after tho door was closed\nand secured for tho night. Whtlo the\nlock might have been turned from the\noutsldo with a master key, there was\nstill tho bolt to hold it, and that this\ncould not have been slipped by any\nother hund than mine I was absolutely\nsuro. Moreover, there was no hidden\nmechanism connected with tho bolt,\nwhich was a simple, commonplace af-\nfair, bearing the name of a well-known\nmaker and ovldently attached to the\ndoor after tho house was completed.\ndiving up In despair, for tho pros-\ncnt, at least, I descended to tho\ngrou-.Al floor again, Intending to make\nn mlnuto inspection of tho house and\ngrounds, when a faint odor of cigar\nsmoko attracted my notice, and I saw\nthat tho library door was ajar.\nTiptoeing forward, I peered through\ntho opening and beheld, to my amazo\nment, a familiar figure seated comfort\nably In ono of tho largo leather chairs\nwith his feet resting lazily on an\nother in all tho assurance of appar\nent nroDrletorshln. At tho samo In\nitik otant ho turned his head slightly In\nuiy uut-\'uuuu null, uncertain us 10\nwhether ho had seen mo or not, I ro-\ntreated rapidly and noiselessly up tho\nstairs to my room, whoro I locked my\nself In and tried to smother my an-\nger and view tho situation logically.\nWhile tho manner In which tho\nnoto had reached mo was still as much\nof a mystery as over, its contents, at\nleast, wero explained, and my fury\nknow no bounds at the wholly unwar\nranted importlnenco of this sorry at\ntempt at n practical Joke.\nTo mo tho matter was so sacred, so\nprecious, so entirely my own, that my\nrago at tho frivolity of this contempt\'\nlblo jest drove from my mind all\nthought of wonder that a man who\nI had every reason to bellovo, was\nmiles away, should be, at this vory\nmoment, under tho samo roof with\nmo.\nI sat down and gazed out of tho win\ndow across tho river to tho heavily\n-wooded lulls In tho dlstanco, and\nmado an almost superhuman effort to\ncontrol myself. Finally I opened tho\nlottora that had como by tho morn\nlng\'s mail and began to read them in\na perfunctory way. Tho second was\nfrom my secretary, nnd, as I pcrusod\nIt, I suddenly awoko from my apathy\nand read with Interest:\n"Two letters camo this morning\nfrom Mr. Carney, ono postmarked Lon\ndon and tho othor Paris. I forward\nthem, with other papers, under sopa-\nrato cover.\n"Dr. MacArdol called this afternoon\nnnd was greatly surprised to loam\nthat you had gono away so suddonly\nand without sending him word. Ho\nBald ho wantod to seo you on a porson\nHi matter, and seemed qulto disap\npointed at missing you.\n"Tho Jarvls caso has boon post\nponed to the fall tonn."\nTho letter closod with iv few momo\nranda of business mnttors and by the\ntime I had finished reading It my mind\nwas clear to an extont that enabled\nmo to soo things In a reasonable light\nand to appreciate that the mystoryof\nthe not was aa deep If not deeper\nthan evt\nOpening tho iloor I strode down\nirtAlrs, Into the library, and up to the\nfigure in tlia chair.\n"Hello!" I exclaimed, grasping him\nby the arm.\nHotter late than never!" ho re\nsponded with a hearty laugh, "What\nmado you sneak upstairs in that mys\nterious way? Think I was a ghost?"\n"No," I replied, slowly and serious\nly, "I thought you wore a scoundrel,\nand I owo you an apology from tho\nbottom of my heart!"\n"Havo a cigar, old man," said Mac-\nArdel.\nCHAPTER Vfll.\nA Disappearing Cigar Case.\n\'What on earth brings you hore,\nMao?" I exclaimed, accepting his prof\nfeicd cigar and lighting It with a sud\nden lntsrest and respect for tho tradi\ntional pipe of peace.\n"Train," said MacArdol, "coupled\nwith an overwhelming dcslra to selzo\nupon you and take you oft with mo\nfor a month\'s vacation.\n\'So that\'s why you called at \'my of\nfice yesterday afternoon, eh?" I quer\nied. \'How did you know that I was\nthere?" asked MacArdol.\n\'My secretary mentioned in his\nletter that camo this morning," I ex\nplained. "And It\'s a great good thing\nthat he did, for while tho Information\nonly mado a big mystery out of what\nappeared for a moment to bo a com\nparatlvcly small ono, It served, fortu-\nnately, to clear you In an Instant from\na very serious charge that I was nurs\nlng against you."\n"Humph!" rwld MaeArdel. "So that\'s\ntho way you treat your friends!\nCondemn \'em without a hearing,\neh?"\n\'Well, Mac," I roplled, "this had to\n"When Did\ndo with a matter that only you and I\nknow anything about, and what you\nknow about it you havo merely in\nferred. Then, when I saw you hero In\ntho hoitso thero seemed to bo no other\nexplanation nt all, at least of tho most\nImportant part of tho thing, But now\nIt is more hopelessly tangled up thnn\nbofore, for, as you wore in my ofllco\nyesterday afternoon, you could not pos\nsibly havo had anything to do with It.\n"Delightfully interesting, I\'m suro!"\npaid MacArdol, "and most appropriate\nwhen occurring In n house alleged to\nbo haunted. Still, I confess I could\nfollow you more closely If I had some\nfaint gllmmor of nn Idea of what you\nnro talking about."\nI handed him tho noto, and he read\nIt slowly and thoughtfully.\n"Whon did you got it?" ho oaked.\n"Found it on my bed this morning\nwhon I woke," I replied.\n"Who put It thero?" ho continued.\n"How tho devil do I know who put\nIt thero?" I returned, excitedly. "The\nhouso wns locked up and so was tho\nroom. Tho window was open, I ad\nmit, but I am positive that no ono\ncould havo gotten In that way. Thero\naro too many vines about It, and not\na twig was, bent.\n"So you thought it was a mlraclo\nand that It must have been I who\nporformed it, eh?" said MacArdol. "I\nknow you always maintained that I\nworked a mlraclo whon I cured your\ntyphoid."\n"Hang it all, Mac!" I exclaimed. "I\ndon\'t caro a snap of my llttlo linger\nhow It got on tho bed! I want to know\nwho wroto It!"\n"Woll, I didn\'t, anyhow," said Mac\nArdol. "I novor heard of it boforo. I\nsupposo somebody wanted to play a\nJoko on you for your tomorlty in sleep\ning nlono In a haunted house. Pretty\npoor sort of a Joko, to bo suro, but I\ndon\'t seo anything to warrant your\ngottlng so oxclted over it."\n"Soo hero, Mao!" I said, drawing my\nchair up closo to his, "you don\'t soem\nto understand Just what 1 moan. The\npoint is simply this. No one could have\nwritten a thing UkQ that, la iucU a\nposltlvo way, unless he had known\nthat It was true. Now, you nre the\nonly porr.on living with whom 1 havo\nover talked on this subject, for you\nwill remember that you onco Inti\nmated pretty broadly that I was In\nlovo with Miss Carney."\n"And you denied It flatly," he re\nmarked. "Yes," I replied, "I denied it\nflatly."\n"MacArdol," I said, soberly, looking\nhim squarely In the face, "you\'vo cor\nnorcd mo and I might as woll tell you\ntho wholo thing. It was three years ago\nwhen wo talked of this before, and T\nmust havo lov.ed hor then and from\ntho day I first saw her. But not as I\nlove her now, old man, for now she In\nmy all In nil and my only thoughts are\nfor her wclfaro and her happlnesn.\nYou know I saw her very frequently\nwhen she was living In town, nnd now\nthat sho is away our correspondence\nIs necessarily frequent, so that I can\nkeep informed of hor whereabouts\nand know of her needs from tho es\ntate." "Of course, you could not pay her\nany attentions unless you meant to\nask hor to marry you," said MacArdol,\n"\' I don\'t see any objection what\neor to that. I know you haven\'t any\nmoney, but your social position Is ns\ngood as hers, and you are doing well\nIn your profession. It seems to me\nthat It would bo a very appropriate\nmatch If you lovo each other."\n"No, Mac," I Insisted. "It\'s better as\nIt is. Considering my position In con\nnectlon with the estate It would bo a\nmean advantage for mo to take, and,\nMac, if sho refused mo, I believe I\nwould kill myself. I\'m such a fool\nover It."\n"Uut supposo sho didn\'t refuse you,"\nsaid MacArdol softly, laying his hand\non my arm.\nVou Get It?"\n"No, old man, It\'s no uso talklnn\nthat way," I replied. "I\'ll just go or\nas I\'ve been doing. It\'s tho only thing\nI can do, as I seo It."\n"Bet you a dinner at Sherry\'s that\nyou proposo to her and marry hor\nwithin two years!" said MacArdol,\nwith a quizzical look In Ills kindly\neyes, nnd, with a half-hearted grasp of\nhis hand, I accepted tho wager with\na tomerlty that was half wishing and\nhalf hopeful.\n"So you ceo why I fnel so strongly\nabout this note," I said, rising and\nopening tho door, which I had closed\ncarefully oa my entrance. "Tho sub\nject Is ono that 1 cannot boar to havo\ntrifled with, and, anyway, I canuot lm\naglno who could havo rend my Inner\nmost thoughts so correctly. That\npuzzles me more than tho .jiystorloua\nnppcaranco of tho letter In my bod."\n"I fancy wo\'ll bo nblo to cxpl.I-r that\nwithout much trouble," said MacArdol,\nlighting a fresh cigar and laying his\ncigar caso on tho tnblo beside him.\n"Thoso mysterious occurrences always\nhappon In a most slmplo fashion, aftor\nall is said and done. Ono night, last\nsummer I was reading In bed nnd Juat\nbeforo putting out tho light I laid ray\noyeglasses on a llttlo tablo about six\nfeet from tho window. I was perfectly\nsuro about It, for tho spring was bont\nslightly and I had spent several min\nutes fussing with them beforo I put\nthem down, Tho next morning they\nwore gono and novor turned up, in\nspito of tho most vigorous search, un\ntil tho maid found them, thrco or four\ndays later, hidden completely In tho\nfolds of tho laco curtain which had\nblown across tho tablo nnd caught\nthem up. As my room was on tho\nfourth floor nnd had beon securoly\nlocked all night, tho affair was qulto\nmystifying until It was so simply \'ex\nplained, Wo\'ll find out beforo long\nhow tho letter got on your bod, nnd\nthat will doubtloss load to tho dis\ncovery of Its author. Havo a fresh\ncigar and show mo around the placa\na bit.

Passenger rates\non nil railroads of the United States\nwill be roduced to 2 cents a mile. Tho\nlowering of the price nnd completo\nabolition of tho old 3-cent ratC3 will\nbegin July 1.\nThis was tho decision reached In\nChicago after a long and heaied dis\ncussion by the loading railroad presi\ndents of all tho Western and trans\ncontinental ronds\'.

Tho caso\nwill go on through tho aggressive\ncross-examination nnd the state will\nthen present evidence In rebuttal, but\nIt has already put forward Its main\nproposition.\nAs to the Steunenberg crime, which\nis the ono charged against Haywood,\nthe state has made the following show\ning:\nHaywood sent money to Simpkins,\nwho lived with Orchard, nine days be\nfore the murder of Steunenberg, and\nan unsigned letter from Denver, show-\nlng by Its address to "Thomas Houan,"\nthat the author knew tho alias of Or\nchard.

Tho new president is\nDarwin P. Klngslcy, a collcgo bred\nman of good New England stock, who\nhas been in the company\'s service in a\nvariety of capacities for a period of\nnearly twenty years. In the parlance\nof llfo Insurance, ho "began with the\nrate book" and has advanced step by\nstep up to his present position.\nThe first vlco president of tho com\npany Is Thomas A. Buckner, who has\nserved the company for more thnn a\nquarter of a century, Indeed has\nnever had any other business connec\ntion. Associated with these men are\nothers long trained In the company\'s\nservice, each an expert in his own de\npartment of work. Wm. E. ingersoll,\nwho has for many years had charge\nof the company\'s great business In\nEurope, Is ono of tho second vlco pres\nidents, and will continue at the head\nof the company\'s office in Paris.\nRufus W. Weeks, who has been in\nthe company\'s service for nearly forty\nyears, ranks next to Mr. Buckner as\nvlco president, and continuous as chief\nactuary of the company.\nThe policyholders have expressed\ntheir belief in this company in no un\ncertain terms. The upheaval In life In\nsurance within tho last two years has\nresulted In a great deal of misunder\nstanding and policyholders, alarmed on\nmatters which wero not very clear to\nthem, havo been disposed to give up\ntheir contracts at a heavy sacrifice,\nThis has not been true In the New York\nLlfo to any great extent. The com\npany had $2,000,000,000 Insurance on\nIts books when the llfo Insurance In\nvestigation began, and whllo the laws\nof the State of Now York now do not\npermit any aompany to write over\n?150,000,000 a year (which Is about\none-half the New York Life formerly\n?lld), the company\'s outstanding busi\nness still exceeds $2,000,000,000.\nPolicyholders generally will be still\nfurther reassured by this action of the\nBoard, as It places at the head of the\ncompany to protect their Interests men\nof thorough training nnd unoxceptlon\nable character.\nFish Quickly Goes Bad.\nNot any nrtlclo of food undergoes\npoisonous chango so rapidly as fish.\nAnd no stale food Is so poisonous as\nstale fish, If any one Ash is worso\nthan another In this regard, It is mack\nerel. Fish should bo cooked as soon\naftor being caught as possible. And\nwhat canuot 1-0 eaten should bo thrown\naway. Soused mackerel loft In tho\nlarder for 24 hours Is very unwhole\nsome. References to Age.\nIt has como to bo a pleco of rude\nness to question one on age; It is tact\nful to Ignore tho dellcato subject alto\ngether, and accopt what Is offered by\nword of mouth or appearance Wo\nmen as well as men aro as old as they\nlook and seem, theso days, nnd if wo\ncan manage to dress In n fashion that\nhas no hint of ago nbout it. wo can\npass muster among the keenest-eyed.\nDOCTOR\'S FOOD TALK\nSelection of Food One of the Most Im\nportant Acts In Life.\nA Mass. doctor says: "Our health\nand physical and mental happiness\nnro so largely under our personal con\ntrol that tho proper selection of food\nshould be, and Is ono of tho most Im\nportant acts in llfo,\n"On this subject, I may say that I\nknow of no food equal In digestibility,\nand more poworful in point of nutri\nment, than tho modern Grapo-Nuts,\nfour heaping teaspoons of which Is suf\nficient for tho cereal part ot a meal,\nnnd experience demonstrates that tho\nusor Is perfectly nourished from ono\nmeal to another.\n"I am convinced that tho extenslvo\nnnd goueral uso of high class foods of\nthis character would lncreasu tho term\nof human llfo, add to the sum total ot\nhappiness and vory considerably im\nprove) society In general.

LOUIS MO,\n18\nUN AMERICAN POLICY\nEVIL IN PROPOSED GOVERNMENT\nOWNER3HIP OF RAILROADS.\nIs Socialistic and Contrary to Pro\nvisions of the Constitution Demo\ncratic Plan Provides Only\nFeasible Solution.\nAccording to Webster\'s, dictionary,\nsocialism Is a social stato In which\n.hero Is a community of property\namong all tho citizens; and tho word\nsaid to ho a new term for agrarian\nIsm. A socialist Is therefore n person\nwho advocates a community of prop\nerty among; all tho cltliens of tho\nitnte.\nState socialism, or agrarlanlsm, Is\ntabooed In tho foderal constitution,\nby which personal liberty and prlvato\nproporty nro protected In tho samo\nsentence and under tho samo words\nwith hur.an life. No person shnll\n"bo deprived of life, liberty, or propor\nty, without duo process of law; nor\nshall prlvato property bo taken for\npublic uso without just compensa\ntion." These words aro found In tho\nfamou.1 fifth amendment. Tho con\nstitution also guarantees "tho right\nof tho people to bo sccuro In their per\nsons, papers, houses, and effects." t\nSocialism Is, therefore, absolutely\nInconsistent with Americanism. Yet\nthis does not Imply that cities, coun-\nties or states may not, or snouiu nor.,\nbuild, own, and operato railroads,\nturnpikes, bridges, gas-works, water\nworks, telephone aystoms, strcot-cnr\nlines, subways, or anything which\nmay properly bo called a public util\nity, any more than It Implies that tho\ngovernment of tho union may not\nown Its shipyards, gun factories, war\nships, military railway, telegraph and\ncable lines; Its "forts, magazines,\narsenals, dockyards and other needful\nbuildings;" Its military and naval\nstores, Its coaling stations, Its mints,\nIts printing establishments\', etc.\nTho government might own and\noperate a railroad for military or\nnaval purposes, and It does, In fact,\nnow own anil operato a railroad In\nPanama, and It Is constructing a canal\nthere for national purposes consistent\nwith tho constitution. But It has no\nauthority to own or operato "trunk\nlines" engaged In ordinary Interstate\ncommerce. Its power over such lines\nis only tho "power ti. regulate," a sort\nof police power entlroi.? distinct from\nownership, yet amply sufllcicnt to\ncontiol all Interstate commerco and\nIts Instrumentalities. No man who\nreveres tho constitution or prizes In\ndividual lights will ever consent to\n"federal ownership of trunk lines."\nBecause, such ownership being un\nnecessary nnd tending to socialism\nand despotism, is un-American, and\ncontrary to the entire ethical and po\nlitical Ideals of the English-speaking\nraces. A leader who would advocato\nsuch a policy would find himself at I\nhomo In a feudal monarchy, but not In\na republic.\nTho Democratic party, through Its\nleaders In 1S8S, devised flio only con\nstitutional or feasible plan for con\ntrolling interstate and foreign com\nmerce. On January 30, of that year,\nMr. Raynor Introduced In the houso\nof representatives a bill based on the\ncommerco clauso of the constitution;\nand on August 11, of the samo year,\nMr. Iteagau introduced a similar bill\nIn tho senate, providing for tho con\ntrol of trusts, and definin? a trust;\nand subsequently Mr. Wand of Mis\nsouri offered an amendment, provid\ning that "every contract or agree\nment for transportation of\npersons or proporty from ono stato\nor territory Into another shall be\ndeemed unlawful within tho meaning\nof this act" (21 Record, 1101). This\namendment was aimed at tho railroad\n"pools and tho Standard Oil trust,\nft passed tho lower house unanimous\nly, but was partly stricken out by tho\nsenate. It would have rendered tho\nso-called Sherman anti-trust act,\nwhich was really the Itaynor-Heagnn\nbill, entirely effective. All that Is now\nneeded Is to Incorporate tho prlnclplo\nof the old Wand amendment into tho\nanti-trust law anil Incieaso tho jiennl\nties for Its violation by making such\nviolation a folony and punishing by\nImprisonment tho criminals found\nguilty. It Is as foollslvto talk of malt\ning the govorumont own tho railroads\nin order to govern thorn as It would\nbe lie to talk of making It own all\nmm in order to govern thorn. Gov\'\nernment ownership would result In\nplacing nil railroad employos at tho\nmercy of designing politicians, and\ncreate- tlio worst political machine\ncter devised by mau.\nCan Do No Wrong!\nIn order to show that ho Is as fit as\na fiddle, physically, tho president has\nhad some Jumping pictures taken, on\nhorseback.
