B\nRAILROAD.\nWilliamsporl Svn Prints Interesting Story\nol This Important Short Line.\nIn connection with the published\nreports that the Willianisport and\nNorth Branch rail road may enter\nWilliamsport directly within the\ncoining year, The Hun of that city\nprints the following interesting his\ntory of the road:\nSome time in the late forties ol\nthe century there came to the north\neastern part of Lycoming [county,\nthat portion which was afterwards\nset off to form the country of Sul\nlivan, a man named Michael\nMeylert. He had considerabit\nmoney of his own and represented\nvast land interests. He acquired\nfor himself and others tens of thous\nands of acres of the wilderness, wa>\ninstrumental getting the new\ncountry erected, laid out the town of\nLaporte, erected and presented to\nthe new county its Hrst Country\nhouse and entered upon a scheme\nof development with an energy\nthat proved Iflm to he at least fifty\nyears ahead of his gene-ation. lit\nearly learned of the vast coal de\nposits in the mountains of Sullivan\ncounty, and in the fall of 1851 en\ngaged with prominent Towanda\ncapitalists and business men in a\nscheme to construct a lailroad for\nthe purpose tapping the black dia\nmond treasury. The scheme was an\nunbitious one no less than to build a\nrailroad from Towanda on the\nnorth through the Sullivan county\n■oal\'flelds, and reaching Catawissa\n:>n tht. south. At that time the Read\ning railroad was constructed as far\nnorth as the Catawissa and the Le\nhigh Valley had not yet been con\nceived, of. so that Michael Meylert\'s\nscheme was really an extension of\nthe Reading railroad. The title of\nthis proposed road was to be the\nTowanda and Catawissa railroad. In\nNovember he caused a survey to be\nmade by William a Mason and\nby Major Klias McNeil, and during\nthe session of the legislature of IK">2,\ni)f which he was a member, he se\ncured a passage of an act authoriz\ning the building of the Towanda\nand Catawissa railroad, anil the\ncompany was empowered to "make\nsuch connections with other roads\nand have a> full authority over any\npart as though they had completed\nthe whole road." This subsequent\nly became the basis of other legis\nlation, by which the State line and\nSullivan Railroad company and the\nMuncy Creek company were charter\ned.\nThe peculiar wording of the en\nabling act, which phraseology was\nafterwards engrafted into the charter,\nis virtually authority to the old\nMuncy Creek railroad to build rail\nroad wherever they may happen to\nwant to for all time to come. Compe\ntent legal authority has declared that\nnot even the Pennsylvania railroad\ncharter confers upt.n the road such\nunbounded authority as is possessed\nby this little Muncy Creek its heirs\nand assigns. In this the fine hand\nof Mieliat I Meylert was made evi\ndent. Interesting} Philadelphia capi\ntalists, be obtained from them a\npromise of sufficient money to build\nthe road if the if the coal veins wen\nall to be claimed for them. A ge\nologist by the name of Shaffer was\nengaged to examine the field, but he\nfailed to find the coal that Meylert\nknew was there, and reported ad\nversely. In 18.">9 the rich vein of\nnear what is now the thrilling min\ning town of Bernice was aeeidently\nuncovered, and it was clearly demon\nstrated that there was coal enough\nto pay for the road. Before arrange\nments could be made to build, the\nCivil War came 011 and paralyz\ned business all over the county, but\nas soon as the war was over the plans\nwere again laid to construct the long\ntalked of railroad through the Sul\nlivan coal fields. In 18<>7 work was\nbegun at Monroeton, four miles\nsouth and east of Towanda, on the\nState line and Sullivan road and by\n1871 this was completed as far 4s the\npresent town of Bernice, and coal\nmining began.\nMeanwhile Meylert was beset\nwith financial dilliculties, and his\nend of the road did not prosper as it\nshould. The Muncy Creek railroad\nhad been chartered wfth Michael\nMeylert, H. It. Mehrling, Robert\nTaylor, George Bodine and A. L.\nDetrick named as incorporators, and\nthe expressed intension of building\nfrom Muncy up the creek to La\nporte, and thence to a connection\nwith the Htate line and Sullivan at\nBernice. Meylert was president\nof the company, Joshua Bow was\ntreasurer and B. M. Ellis, secre\ntary and 11. 11. Mehrllng superin\ntendent. Muncy offered little en\ncouragement to the scheme and tin\nsouthern terminus was changed to\nHalls. Work was begun in 18(1(5,\nand in 1807 nine miles of road were\nbuilt northward from Halls, to a\npoint three miles beyond Ilughes\nville. So far the work had been\neasy and comparatively, inexpen\nsive, but when the foothills of North\nMountain had been reached the mon\ney ;was all gone and the Phila\ndelphia capitalists would not fur\nnish another cent. In 1872 the Cata\nwissa extension of the Reading was\nbuilt up to Williamsport, and a con\nnection made at Halls with the am\nbitious little road that was headed\nfor the mountains. It is not sur\nprising that this little strip of road\nwas a financial white elephant and\nin 1881 it was sold by the bondhold\ners under foreclosure proceedings and\nthe company was then reorganized\nunder the title of the Williamsport\nand North Branch railroad and Ben\njamin Welch became the general\nmanager. Work was resumed in\n188(>, and a dash made for the heart\nof the mountains, and the long wish\ned for coal fields. The road was\ncarried as far north at that time as\nNoidmont. There was no Nord\nmont when the Railroad stopped at\nthe gorge of Muncy Creek because\nthere was no money with which to\nbuild a bridge, and the little ham\nlet sprang up around the blunt end\nof the railroad and was given the\nScandanavian name that signifies\nNorth Mountain. \'\nThus things rested until 1893,\nwhen another reorganisation was\neffected, this time with Buffalo par\nties holding a controlling interest in\nthe stock. John Saterfield and\nHenry Taylor undertook the financ\ning of the road, and the company\nwas organized with 11. C. McCorm\nic, of Williamsport president; John\nSatterfield of Buffalo, vice president,\nand J. Henry Cochran and Seth T.\nMcCormic secretary and treasurer.\nWork was resumed and in the fall\nof 18!);) the road finally reached a\njunction with its northern twin, tin-\nState line and Sullivan, at a point\nthat used v to be called Dohijj\'s Sum\nmit, but waa changed to Satterfield\nin compliment to the man who was\nfurnishing the money.\nMeylert had long since died,\nand what ever ambitious project\nwas on foot with the little North\nBranch at that time w as defeated by\nthe sudden death of Satterfield and\nthe refusal of his heirs to continue\nin the scheme. The Lehigh Va\'ley\nhad required the State Line and Sul\nlivan In 1885. and about the time of\nthere-organization ol\'the William\nsport and North Branch, the Read\ning railroad had effected a lease of\nthe Lehigh Valley, whereby they\nbecame absolute masters of the road,\nand it was freely said at the time\nthat the completion of the North\nBranch was but the completion of a\nconnecting Spur between two great\nbranches of the Reading and that it\nwas to form a part of a grand trunk\nroad from Philadelphia to Buffalo,\nand that the Reading would run\nthrough trains iu the competition\nfor western traffic. About the time\nthe road was completed to Satterfield\nthe Reading defaulted in its pay\ni. dnta on.he Lehigh Valley lease\nand the two roads became separated\nand their interests diverged.\nThe renewed activity of the Wil\nliamsport and North Branch affairs\nwould indicate that large moneyed\ninterests have again seen the possi\nbilities of the road, aud that it may\nyet take its place in the great rail\nroad systems of rhe state.\n«tm*t Tobacco Spit and Sii vke lour rift\' in,,.\n7*l quit tobacco easily and forever, be run"\nÜbtic. lull ol life, nerve and take No \'Lo\nSot, tile wotuier-worKer, Uittl onuses uoalt me:\nstrong. «li drncfcists, SOc or Jl.

From\nthe time the blank sheets are de\nlivered by careful count until ;J0 d«ys\nlater, when the printed bills are\nsent to the treasury to have the seal\nprinted thereon, the bureau must\naccount for every sheet in its hands.\nIt is counted when wet, when print\ned on one side, when dried, when\nwet again, when printed again,\nwhen dried a second lime, when ex\namined fori nperfection, when num\nbered—in short counted some 50\ntimes before it finally escapes from\nthe bureau. It has become accustom\ned to he counted before it starts out\ninto the world as monoy, and then\ncontinues to be counted until it is\nreturned, ragged,dirty and worn out,\ncounted to death—only to be again\nounted and destroyed.\nWould Pennsylvania with its\nbulging treasury and her face set to\nward the works of love and charity;\nPennsylvania with her hand stretch\ned out to stop disease, poverty and\ndeath, —would Pennsylvania tax her\npoor by levying a tax on every ton\nof coal the poor man\'s family needs\nfor warmth and household exigen\ncies?\nThis is a question now under\nserious consideration, the out\ngrowth of a proposition to place a\nsmall tax of perhaps one cent a ton\non anthracite and bituminous coal in\norder to provide more revenue to\nmeet heavier appropriations for\nschools, good roads and so forth.\nUndoubtedly the statu will need\na greater revenue and ways must be\nprovided to get it through new tax\nation.
