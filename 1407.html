This may be due to Mur\nphy, as Douglas evidently thinks,\nand it may be that Soper bad a\nhand in it. As soon as Soper got\nto Washington rumors of investi\ngation came back thick and faet.\nThen Murphy was sent for and\nwhen he reached Washington the\norder came.\nDouglass was supposed to be\nclose to the secretary of the inter\nior.\nThe way of the politician is\nhard, and is lined with ax\nMuskogee Times.\nr\nNEW INDIAN REGIME.\nSay Change to Bonded Superintend\nent Will Work Needed Reforms.\nGov. T. B. Fergnson of Okla\nhoma heartily commends the new\nplans of the Indian department in\nplacing the different agencies un\nder bonded t-uperintendents,"Tbis\nplan will succeed because it elimi\nnates the Indian service from pol-\ncluded the Caddo, Apac\'iea and\nWicbitas.\nThis chance in the manner of\noverseeing the Indian, which bus\nlong bnen contemplated by (he de\n"r\'liuent, is regardel as promot\ning the interests of the Indian, as\nwell as the government. Most of\nthe bonded superintendents who\nbave been tried have graduated\nfrom the ranks of Indian teachers\nand superintendents of Indian\nschools, and are neither depend\nent upon political pulls nor have\nprivate interests to serve. It is\nnot intended to bar out such agen\'s\nas have proven their ability, as\nwell as their honesty Such in\nfact receive as good a show as\nteachere, to receive appoin\'ments\nas bonded superintendents, but\nthe majority ot the superintend\nents will be recruited from the\nteachers ranks.\nBnrtKett, & Milford wish 300 bushels\nof whea\'. hauled from the Military\ncrossing; apply at once "\nCOMPLEXION AND LIVER.\nImportant Function of the Organ\nand Their Effect on the Facial\nAppearance.\nSince a bad complexion is usually di\nrectly traceable- to a disordered liver\nsome knowledge as to the function\nof that very unruly organ should be\nindispensable.

George Stouch, United States\narmy, gives away as agent to three\nbonded superintendents. These\nwill be stationed at various places\nin the reservation Among these\nIndians a great work has been\nWrought during the past twoyears\nby John S-ger, who steps into one\nof tbe places as b inded supeiin\ntendent. Within that time he has\ninstructed tbe Indians to farm,\nconstruct buildings, manufacure\nbrick, and now ther are building\na ejstera of good roads through\ntheir reservation.

So great has been tbe ad\nvauceDieot of the Arapahoe Chey.\neooe squaws that Seger intends\nmaking a special exhibit of their\nwork at the Louisiana Purchase\nExposition.\nAt tbe Sac and Fox agency the\nsgent, Ross Guffin, becomes tbe\nbonded superintendent, and tte\nsame change is made at the Shaw-nt-e\nagency, where Agent Frank\nTliackery becomes tbe euperin\ntendent Pottawatomies, Shaw\nn-es and Kickapona are embraced\niu (\'barkery \'a jurisdiction.

I\'art of the\nsr\'jcogeii is converted into sugar and\naii-\'harf ed into the blood, vhere by\n"union with oxvpen it furnishes heat\n-f-r the body. Some of the glycogen\nia chi.rgpd into fat. which is also sent\ninto tH blood, finally lodging in some\n;-isnie which it nourishes.\nlhe ni\'ist important function, of ih\naver is the changing of waste material\nnto tiibst.am-e that can be easily ex\ncreted by other organs. Every mo\nment of hfe the particles of the body\nare being destroyed and renewed, and\nthe debris is received into the blood.\nWhen the bile secrelU\'n is defective\nthe chief symptoms are constipation,\nsallowness and thinness.\nIf the glycogen function is defective\nthe temperature is low and tho body\nis often emaciated. Digestion always\nsuffers, and the skin, besides being sal\nlov, is apt to break out inf.Aiisorders.\nDrugs Iring relief, but they do not\ncure these disorders. The sys.tem\nihould be brought under hygienic con\nditions by proper diet and living. The\ncirculat ion of the blood should be good,\nfor all the blood in the body is supposed\nto pass through the liver twice in every\nminute. Circulation can be effected\nby systematic exercise.\nIf dyspepsia is present, give up the\nindigestible srticles of food, instead\nof digesting them w ith pepsin or other\ngenu-?.

S. Skinner contributed a paper\non the slipperiness of ice. This has\nbeen attributed to the presence of a\nlayer of Iubrient.nir water under the I\ndy preying on the ice. The water\nis produced by the lowering of the\nfreeing point whcre the pressure is\nexperienced. On this view the object\nglides on a liquid layer, and conse\nquently viscous friction in water\ntakes the place of the rubbing fric\ntion between the solids. Joly has\nshown by calculation that the weight\nof a man concentrated on the blade\nof a skate it sufficient to lower the\nfreelnir point very considerably, and\nReynolds. av -big from the diiiicultv\nof sllpp ;: on " ry cold ice, comes to\nthe same ( r. \' . ion.

JUNE 30.\n""iVboM defend Douglas ?\nIn the debris of Cherokee poli\ntics there are a few things worth\nsaving.\nThe Pryor Creek people have\nput out a very excellent fourth of\nJuly advertisement in the way of\nplain posters but have neglected\nto state where it is to be.

What they\n"lark in \'the way of being vote\ncatchers was eimply an oversight.\nThe intention has been to suit\nTHE FALL OF DOUGLAS.\nClarence Douglass was pereoop.\ntorily discharged from service in\nthe Indian office at Muekogee\nyesterday. They lay the blame\nof his downfall on the clase\nic shoulders of Pliny Soper,\nbut is not sure as to who\nhit him. He believes that when\nhe butted into the National Com-\nmitteeman fight against such party\nwarriors as Soper and Mellette\nhis doom was sealed. It was in.\ntimated long ago\'--that" Douglas\nwas disobeying the express order\nof the department of the Interior\nby wearing long hair ala Crszy\nSnake, John Henry Dick Zeke\nProcter and Dave Muskrat. Others\nattrjute his discharge to his dif-\'-\'"ence\nwith the Secretary on the\nUubject of statehood for the terri\nlories. Anyway Douglas has ed\nited the republican organ at Mus\nkogee and has defended the party\nin season and out of season, and\nwhen Tarns Bixby has said jump,\nhe has always leaped with great\nalacrity and even gusto,\nBut the mystery of it. Douglas\nhas steadfastly maintained that\nthe government service in the ter\nlitory has been immaculate, and\nit is the irony of fate that hia head\nis the first to go. He and Secre\ntary Hitchcock were like brothers.\nThey had only recently exchang\ned pictures and the military pro\nfile, and flowing lacks of Douglas\ngraced the most conspicuous bdiH\ncm the wall of the private sane\n. turn of the Secretary. On the\nother hand the lifesized portrait\nof Mr. Hitchcock ornamented the\nPheonix office.\nBut Douglas should not pine.\nHe is still great. He is captain\nof the guard. His shoulder straps\nand epaulets are out of the reach of\nSoper and the common herd of\nrepublican boeses.\nThe July Criterion.\nThe July Criterion is always one of\nthe most attractive summer period\nicals and the "fiction number" with\nits seasonable cover design in colors,\nby John Cecil Clay, and handsome\nillustrations, offers an unusually\npleasant opportunity to , magazine\nlovers to avail themselves of some\nthoroughly wholeseine, high-class\nshort stories.

There\'s always a crease\nthat can\'t be ironed out or something\nof that sort, and it takes time and\ntrouble. Your wife studies over the\ngown that is to be let out for two\ndays, and tJien submits it to a dress\nmaker, who informs her that through\necme oversight there is a shortage\nof material at some point, and\ncharges her for the information. An\neffort to match the goods falls, and\nafter two weeks of worry a new\ngown is ordered."\n"You certainly speak from experi\nence." "What is needed is a reef iu some\ncases a double reef. With all the\nfurbelows and flounces and strings\nand things it would be very easy to\narrange, it seems to me, and then\nthere could be no oversight. The\ngown would be made the full length\nneeded for future use and then\nreefed up. The plainness of a sail\nwould hardly do, but there could be\nembroidered reef points and orna\nmental cleats. Then, in the spring,\nwhen your wife got out the gown\nthat was just as good ns new when it\nwas put away the preceding fall,\nthere would be no harrowing scenes.\nIf, when you were deep in your pa\nper, she disturbed you with the cry,\n\'Oh, dear, it\'s scandalously short.\nWhy do children grow so?\' you could\nreply. \'Well shake out a reef.\' It\nwould take less than five minutes\'\nwork and be no expense at all. But\nyou can\'t expect the dressmakers to\ntake up the idea of their own accord,\nfor it would mean a dead loss to\nthem. We men haVe pot 1o get to\ngether and force this reform, and we\nmay have to subsidize a few fashion\neditors to bring it about. After all,\nit takes man to evolve the money\nsaving and labor saving schemes of\nthis world.

It id already clear\ntbat the pfcOHiona fjr this little\nwar will coat more than the war\nitself, for, while the war\'was soon\nover, the pensions will drag nn\nfor years arid years.\nCivil war pensioners, forty years\nafter the war, are about as nutnei\noua as they ever were. "Cuban\nveterans promise an even longer\n\'lease on life, for they were picked\nyoung men. Fifty years from\nnow it will be no uncommon\nthing, perhaps for the govern\nment to pay Spanish war pensions\nto dependent widuws who are not\nyet born. It is impossible, of\ncourse, that 60,000 of the men\nwho enlisted in the Spanish war,\nand only 20,000 of whom even got\nto the front, should have been\nsufficiently disabled as to justify\ntheir demand for pensions.\nThe thing is becoming a ecan\ndal that seriously reflects upon\nthe patriotism and honesty of the\nmen whom the nation would like\nto regard as ideal citizens. It is\nbad enough to know that the gov\nernment is frauded, but itis worse\nslill to know tbat the soldiers who\nmight have fought bravely, bad\nthe opportunity been oflered, can\nstoop to such a palpable , attempt\nat fraud.\nThe fault is do doubt mostly in\nthe pension department. The\ngranting of one false claim breeds\nmany other false claims. The\nease with which a fraudulent pen\nsion can be secured encourages\nmen to put in claims they would\nnot have thought of offering if\nsure to be subjected to close and\nhonest scrutiny.\nThere is a seductiveness about a\npension hard to be resisted. And\nthe looseness of the pension de\npartment is corrupting into sneaks\nand perjurers many who Height\notherwise be .regarded as the bet\nmen in the nation. J\nIt is a fraud tbat should have\nlaid upon it a heavy hand. K.
