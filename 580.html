        <pre>["ALLIED GAINS IN  T H E  M IDDLE EAST 235\nmade through the Near East, before \nhe reached Russia, aroused great in\xad\nterest on the part of many states\xad\nmen who regarded his visit as a sign \nthat the United States was deeply \ninterested in the fate of that part \nof the world. In Turkey especially \nhis visit was taken as an opportunity \nto state once again Ankara’s position \non the war. The Turkish govern\xad\nment let it be known that unless un\xad\nacceptable demands were made upon \nit, it had no intention of departing \nfrom its policy of an alliance with \nGreat Britain and a friendship pact \nwith Germany. This delicate balance \nwas illustrated by the attentions paid \nto Willkie on the one hand, while a \nfew weeks later shipments were re\xad\nported of 45,000 tons of chrome for \nGermany to be paid for in armaments.\nIn addition to clarifying their pol\xad\nicy of neutrality, the Turkish states\xad\nmen were eager to impress upon the \nAmerican visitor the fact that all \nthey desired after the war was to \npreserve their frontiers and to take, \ntheir rightful place in world trade. \nIn this connection, Willkie is re\xad\nported to have assured the Turks \nthat the United States would expect \nno territorial sacrifices from Turkey \nafter the war and would grant her \na full share in the economic benefits \nof a victory of the United Nations. \nWillkie also cheered his hosts with \nthe optimistic news he brought from \nCairo.\nCHINA'S MARCH TO FREEDOM\nBy J. S. GURLEY\nD o u b t s  that the Chinese people may \nhave of the “readiness of the leading \ndemocracies of the world to stand up \nand be counted upon for the freedom \nof others after the war is over” \nshould in large part be allayed by \nthe announcement that the United \nStates and Britain plan to undertake \nnegotiations with China for the end\xad\ning of extraterritorial and other \nspecial rights and privileges in the \nnear future. The question has been \nunder consideration for several \nmonths, and when the announcement \nwas made on October 9 it was timed \nfor the eve of the thirty-first anni\xad\nversary of the founding of the Chi\xad\nnese Republic on October 10. There \nwas at once a tremendous increase \nin holiday jubilation in Chungking, \nfor getting rid of extraterritoriality \nis the fulfillment of another part of \nSun Yat-sen’s will and constitutes \nperhaps the most important step yet \ntaken to clear aw ay  the legal barriers \nto complete national independence.\nThe promise, Generalissimo Chiang \nKai-shek told cheering crowds, \nmeant that henceforth they should \nredouble their efforts to increase \ntheir strength and strive to be citi\xad\nzens of a really free and independent \nnation.\nExtraterritoriality means the right \nof foreigners to be tried in special \ncourts not subject to the laws of \nChina. It has been a major thorn \nrankling in China’s side as a feature \nof the “unequal treaties” imposed by \nthe Western powers during the nine\xad\nteenth century, a symbol of her semi\xad\ndependent status. At the close of the \nFirst World War the Soviet govern\xad\nment relinquished Russia’s rights, \nand the defeated powers had theirs \ntaken away. The Japanese invasion \nof China in 1937 deprived the United \nStates and Great Britain of these \nrights for all practical purposes. Yet \nthe formal action by these two coun\xad\ntries largely  removes th e  basis for \nJapanese propaganda concerning\n", '236 CURRENT HISTORY, NOVEMBER, 1942\nWestern imperialism, and provides \na firmer foundation for future Chi- \nnese-American harmony.\nW1LLKIE AT CHUNGKING\nThe move was possibly foreshad\xad\nowed by the pronouncements of \nWendell L. Willkie, who arrived as \nPresident Roosevelt’s private emis\xad\nsary in Chungking a week before, \non October 2, after a 4,000-mile \nflight across Asia from the Russian \nfront. Willkie was greeted with a \nremarkable ovation by the thousands \nwho had turned out to see him. Only \nthe Japanese seem to have missed \nthe show.\nThe Chinese people and army, ac\xad\ncording to government comment, \nhave been greatly encouraged and \nChinese-American bonds have been \nstrengthened by the visit. Willkie \nhas been outspoken in his demands \nthat “this war must mean an end to \nempire of nations over other nations” \nand has reminded Americans that \nour allies who have given millions \nof their finest men to contribute to \nthe defeat of the Axis aggressors \nmust have an "equitable share of our \narms production.”\nAs honorary national chairman of \nUnited China Relief, Willkie also \nmade a survey of the disposition of \nthe funds sent from America for the \nrelief and rehabilitation of China’s \nwar refugees. This aid, in addition \nto the guns and planes we are con\xad\ntributing, is helping to sustain wel\xad\nfare and morale through the financ\xad\ning of Chinese industrial coopera\xad\ntives, mission relief stations, orphan\xad\nages, mobile first-aid units and hos\xad\npitals. $5,355,750 has been allocated \nto be spent between April, 1942, and \nApril, 1943.\nUnfortunately, this kind of help as \nwell as our military assistance has \nbeen all too limited and, as Willkie \npointed out, it is only natural for the \nChinese to wonder what has hap\xad\npened to the boasted United States \nproduction. On the map China may \nlook like the last stop on the line, \nbut it is now in its sixth year of \nsustained war effort against one of \nthe most powerful military nations \nin the world and is actually a first \nline of defense, the only country that \nwill enable the United Nations to in\xad\nitiate a continent-based offensive \nagainst the heart of the Japanese \nempire.\nChina had to fight on alone with \nvery little support from the outside \nworld for four and a half years while \nJapan was being armed by American \nindustry. When the “incident” at \nMarco Polo Bridge took place on \nJuly 7, 1937, the Japanese High \nCommand told the Japanese people \nthat the “China Punitive Expedition” \nwould be a mere three-month picnic \nfor the Imperial Army. Never did \nthey dream that China would become \nwhat she is today, a unified nation, \ninflexible in her resolve to fight on \nto the finish. Never did they dream \nthat the war would be responsible for \nan industrial revolution in China. \nFor these reasons, China is still in \nthe war, although the coastal fringe \nwas overrun long ago and she has \nbecome almost isolated from Allied \naid.\nA far-sighted policy of industriali\xad\nzation in western China has done \nmuch to save the nation. In 1937 \nChina was a country almost exclu\xad\nsively engaged in agricultural pro\xad\nduction. Businesses on the eastern \ncoast owned and managed by for\xad\neigners were almost the only factors \nin industrial development, and their \noutput was chiefly consumer rather \nthan durable goods. The loss of this \nindustrialized area within the first \nfew months of the war, the simul\xad\ntaneous capture of most of the exist\xad\ning railroad system and the better \nroads and finally the loss by the early \npart of 1940 of virtually all the coal\n', 'CHINA’S MARCH TO FREEDO M 237\nand iron ore deposits that had been \npreviously worked were staggering \nblows to the Chinese economy.\nFortunately governmental agencies \nimmediately set to work to mitigate\nHangkow to the mountainous strong\xad\nhold of Chungking, the Chinese were \nable at last to concentrate on the \ncreation of a new industrialized \nChina in the interior. And against a\nHenderson in The Providence Sunday Journal\nA  F it t in g  A n n iv e r s a r y  G i f t !\nthese losses. At first through various \ncommissions of the National Military \nCouncil and later through the Min\xad\nistry of Economic Affairs complete \nfactories were transferred from the \ndanger zone to the heart of free \nChina. It is estimated that by Janu\xad\nary, 1942, no fewer than 448 fac\xad\ntories had thus been salvaged. Then, \nwith the shift of the capital from\ntotal of 448 salvaged factories may be \nset the striking achievement of es\xad\ntablishing nearly 1,900 factories \nsince the outbreak of the war.\nChief interest has been centered \non the production of coal and iron \nore and the development of a rudi\xad\nmentary heavy industry. At present \nChina is able to produce firearms, \ngrenades, bayonets and swords, but\n', '238 CURRENT HISTORY, NOVEMBER, 1942\nis still dependent upon imports from \nthe United Nations for all other war \nmaterial. It has been said that Free \nChina may become self-sufficient in \niron and steel, presumably at a much \nrestricted level, by the end of this \nyear. Twenty-nine plants are report\xad\ned to be now in existence and addi\xad\ntional furnaces are continually under \nconstruction. It is true that in 1941 \nthe production of coal and iron was \nbelow the pre-war output, but these \nwere the only two minerals so affect\xad\ned and large reserves of coal and iron \nhave been discovered and will soon \nbe opened up in the western part of \nYunnan and Sikang provinces.\nTextiles have undergone such a \nsteady development to provide the \narmy with clothes and blankets that \nin 1941 the industry accounted for \none-third of the value of all produc\xad\ntion. The chemical industry shows \nprogress second only in importance \nto textiles. In a supposedly backward \ncountry that has no access to rubber \nand only small resources of petro\xad\nleum one development is outstanding \n—the widespread cracking of tung \n(wood) oil for the production of \nsynthetic gasoline and rubber. This \nprocess is at present expensive and \nuneconomic, but technological im\xad\nprovement may yet enable these sub\xad\nstitute products to be marketed on \na normal competitive basis.\nIMPROVED TRANSPORTATION\nAmong China’s severest problems \nhas been that of internal communica\xad\ntion, although last April Dr. Well\xad\nington Koo reported that since the \ngovernment moved to Chungking \n700 miles of railways and 3,000 miles \nof road have been completed while \nabout as many more miles of road \nare under construction. All available \ntypes of pre-modern transportation \nhave been used to supplement the \nother services. Most of these rely \nsimply upon manpower, and it has\nbeen possible to ship goods over the \nroughest terrain which bars the \nJapanese army but is no obstacle to \nhuge gangs of patriotic coolies. The \nloss of the Burma road, which was \nbuilt entirely by Chinese hand labor, \nhas made the problem of communica\xad\ntion between China and the outside \nworld even more serious than the dif\xad\nficulties of internal transportation. \nTo remedy this two immense projects \nare now making rapid progress to \nopen up alternative lifelines, one, a \nnew India Road across the Assam \nmountains, the other, a Tibet Road \nfarther to the north.\nOne of the most interesting phases \nof China’s battle for production has \nbeen the development of the indus\xad\ntrial cooperative movement, which \ncelebrated its fourth anniversary in \nOctober. The cooperative idea was \nfirst promoted in China by members \nof the Kuomintang in 1918 and grew \nsteadily. At the end of 1936 there \nwere nearly 30,000 cooperative socie\xad\nties of all kinds with more than \n500,000 members. The Japanese in\xad\nvasion of the coastal provinces in \n1937 destroyed most of the coopera\xad\ntives, but new life was given to the \nmovement in 1938 by government \nsponsorship.\nIt was then that the Chinese In\xad\ndustrial Cooperatives, popularly- \nknown as C. I. C. or Indusco, came \ninto existence to create a new in\xad\ndustrial base in the interior and be\xad\nhind the Japanese lines—an indus\xad\ntrial base composed of thousands of \nsmall mobile workshops scattered \nthroughout the towns and villages \nwhere many of the simple things \nneeded by the people and the army \ncould be made. In this task of in\xad\ndustrializing a semi-feudal peasant \ncountry Indusco hopes to solve the \nproblem without the exploitation of \npre-war imperialist enterprise.\nIn four years, with an initial capi\xad\ntal loan of only 5,000,000 Chinese\n', 'CH IN A ’S MARCH TO FREEDOM 239\ndollars, Indusco is producing- $1,000- \n000 worth of goods a month. Today \nthere are about 2,400 of these co\xad\noperatives in 18 provinces, with a \nmembership of 100,000 and over \n1,000,000 people dependent on them \nfor a livelihood. Although they are \nsmall and often camouflaged, hidden \nin caves, farmhouses, deserted tem\xad\nples and village homes, they are pro\xad\nducing hundreds of items for China’s \ndefense. Among the most important \nof these are uniforms, clothing, ma\xad\nchinery, leather goods, medical gauze \nand bandages, chemicals, power \nequipment, minerals, blankets, trans\xad\nport facilities, soap, canned goods, \nploughs, household goods, drugs, not \nto mention such military material as \nhand grenades, pistols, revolvers, \nhelmets, land mines and ammunition \nof all kinds.\nFIGHT AGAINST BACKWARDNESS\nIndusco fights China’s backward\xad\nness on all fronts. Four principles \nunderlie the program—sound techni\xad\ncal design, cooperative organizations, \nvoluntary self-discipline and social \nwelfare on the basis of Sun Yat-sen’s \nteachings. In areas where the co\xad\noperatives have taken root, schools, \nclinics, reading rooms and recreation \ncenters have been established. The \ncooperative worker produces goods \nin a shop which he himself partly \nowns; in the evening he goes to \nclasses sponsored by Indusco; his\nchildren may go to an Indusco \nschool; when they are older they \nmay attend Indusco technical schools; \nand when the worker is ill, he and \nhis family will be taken care of by the \nother members of the cooperative. \nAt cooperative meetings he learns \nthe meaning of democracy through \nparticipation in community business; \nand so new horizons have opened up \nfor the Chinese worker.\nNevertheless, the scope of Chinese \nindustrial development during the \npast five years of war must not be \nexaggerated. It will be increasingly \nable to keep guerilla forces in the \nfield pending the arrival of large \nscale assistance and it will provide \neveryday necessities for the unmobil\xad\nized population. But when the war is \nfinally won, the long-term results of \nthe shift of industry may prove to be \nmore important than its immediate \ninfluence on the course of the war. \nThis is because the development of \nthe cooperative movement has linked \nthe industrial revolution with the \nbirth of a fundamentally educational \nand democratic institution through \nwhich many of China’s larger prob\xad\nlems may be solved. For the present, \nhowever, simple admiration for Chi\xad\nnese achievements is insufficient and \nmay be fatal. Guns, tanks and planes \n—the actual heavy stuff of war—and \nmore dollars for relief—all this we \nmust send or freedom in the Far \nEast may be lost forever.\n']</pre>
