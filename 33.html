        <pre>['Darwinism Reaffirmed b y  Latest\nEvidence\nBy W A T S O N  DAVIS\nManaging E ditor, Science Service, W ashington , D . C.\nRECENT SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS\nSCIENCE is at its best when the British \nAssociation for the Advancement of \nScience meets. Not alone England but \nall the world attends and speaks. To its \nsessions many important announcements \nhave been made. Its program is a barom\xad\neter of scientific progress. It is, therefore, \ninteresting that Darwin’s theory of man’s \ndescent was chosen by this year’s Presi\xad\ndent, Sir Arthur Keith, famous anatomist, \nfor his principal address at the Leeds meet\xad\ning. [The full text is printed at the end \nof this article.]\nIn 1860, at an Oxford meeting of the \nBritish Association, the great Huxley had \nhis spectacular fight with the Bishop of \nOxford and emerged victorious. But in that \nday it was the usual conviction that man \nhad appeared on earth by a special act of \ncreation. Today the situation is changed. \nThere are no fights upon evolution at scien\xad\ntific meetings. Occasionally far from the \nlaboratory and the study, o;i the frontiers \nof the spread of knowledge, there are those \nwho wish to suppress the truth by vain \nlaws. Even the spectacle of Dayton has \nhad no encore. Those who listened to Sir \nArthur Keith’s summary of the recent dis\xad\ncoveries which tend to support Darwin’s \nideas did not have to be convinced; the the\xad\nories which they already held were only \nstrengthened, not altered.\nA t the conclusion of such an address, it \nwas fitting that announcement would be \nmade of plans by the British Associa- \ntion looking toward tho preservation of\nDarwin’s old home as an international \nshrine. This historic home in the village \nof Dowm in the Kentish uplands may in \nfuture years rival Shakespeare’s at Strat- \nford-on-Avon as a place of interest.\nEnglishman’s Evolving Physique \nEvolution is not a process that is con\xad\nfined to the past, for Professor P. G. Par\xad\nsons of the University of London reported \nto tho British Association researches that \nindicate that the physical characteristics of \nthe typical Englishman are undergoing a\nchange. His head shape is showing unmis\xad\ntakable signs of an increase of its propor\xad\ntional height, with a decrease of its pro\xad\nportional length. This increase of propor\xad\ntional height is greater than has been found \nin any of the stocks from which the modem \nEnglishman is derived, and Professor Par\xad\nsons believes it therefore cannot be looked \nupon as harking back to any ancestral form, \nbut must be regarded as an evolutionary \nprocess, in harmony with the greatly \nchanged conditions of life which have come \nabout during the last century. Professor \nParsons has also found that the Englishman \nof the future is, if present conditions per\xad\nsist, making for an average height of 5 ft. \n9 in., and the women for one of 5 ft. 6 in. \nor 5 ft. 7 in. “ Our people have reached, \nand are stationary at, a stage in which \nsome 66 per cent, have light eyes and some \n34 per cent, dark,”  he said. “ There are no \nsigns whatever that the hair color has dark\xad\nened during the last sixty years, though \nthere are signs, which perhaps need dis\xad\ncounting, that the hair is lighter than it \nwas sixty years ago.”  ... _ /\nFuture of the A ntarctic \nSince England is one of the great coloniz\xad\ning nations of the world, it is not strange \nthat the presidential address before the \ngeographical section of the British Associa\xad\ntion, delivered by Dr. R. N. Eudmose \nBrown, should be an analysis of polar prob\xad\nlems. Because of the attention that will\nbe focused upon the Antarctic region in \ncoming months, owing to Commander Byrd’s \nproposed aeronautical explorations there, \nhis discussions of the future of the Ant\xad\narctic are particularly interesting. Little \nhope of permanent settlements upon the \ngreat Antarctic continent is foreseen. \n“ The Antarctic has no human problems \ncomparable with those of the Arctic,”  Dr. \nBrown said. “ It is true that whaling has \nrecently invaded the Antarctic, with the \nvessels in the Boss Sea, not to mention the \nsub-Antarctic whaling in South Georgian \nand Falkland waters. But this can be little\n96\n', "RECENT SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS 97\nmore than a passing phase. Already some \nspecies of whales show signs of depletion \nof numbers, and unless whaling is so rigor\xad\nously shackled by regulations as to make \nit o f little profit compared with the risk it \nentails, the industry must kill itself in a \nfew years' time. For the rest there is noth\xad\ning of value in commerce in the Antarctic; \ncertainly nothing that it can possibly pay \nto exploit. The stories of future Antarctic \ncoal mines can be dismissed as a dream \nwithout any solid foundation. It is fortu\xad\nnate. And those of us who care for the \nwild waste spaces of the world are glad to \nthink of the Antarctic as free from invasion \nby our modern civilization with its insistence \non hurry and noise. We are glad to re\xad\nmember the lonely places of the world and \ntheir matchless beauty, content to know that \nto others they will bring the same fascina\xad\ntion they did to us in years gone by.”\nP o p u l a t io n  G r o w t h\nAnother scientific meeting that aroused \nworld interest was the World Population \nConference at Geneva. One of the leading \nspeakers was Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns \nHopkins University, who explained the law \nof population growth that he has been \nstudying. Peoples rise, flourish a while in \ntheir prime, then dwindle away until no \nincrease in their population growth is per\xad\nceptible. Dr. Pearl believes this character\xad\nistic manner of growth holds good not only \nfor human populations but for living organ\xad\nisms of all sorts. “ The population at first \ngrows slowly,”  Dr. Pearl said, “ but gains im\xad\npetus as it grows, passing gradually into a \nstage of rapid growth, which finally reaches \na maximum of rapidity. After this stage of \nmost rapid growth the population increases \never more and more slowly, until finally \nthere is no more perceptible growth at all, \nin short, the populations of various forms \nof life first wax in their speed of growing \nand then wane.”  Experimental populations \nof yeast, bacteria and that most used \nlaboratory animal, the fruit fly, carefully \nwatched and counted in his laboratory, have \nfurnished evidence that the rise and fall \no f all populations can be depicted by the \nsame general curve.\nG eo lo g ists ’  T r a v e l  S c h o o l\nA promising development in scientific \nstudy and educational method is being made \nthrough the geological train-tours that \nhave been a part of the Summer school \nwork of Princeton University this Sum\xad\nmer and last. Under the direction of Pro\xad\nfessor R. M. Field, a party of students and \nexperienced geologists this year traveled\n10,000 miles across Canada and back again, \nstudying the varied geology of that country. \nThrough the use of a special Pullman car \ncombining the features of classroom, dormi\xad\ntory, dining hall and recreation centre, the \nPrinceton geology class has been able to go \nacross Canada from one side of the North \nAmerican continent to the other, stopping \nwhere the rocks themselves could teach the \nbest lessons. During the day an interesting \nlocality is visited, and just before dinner \ntime the class returns to its traveling home. \nDinner is served, a lecture held, and a \nnight’s rest obtained while the party is \nen route to another locality, perhaps hun\xad\ndreds of miles away. Rocks telling their \nown stories, embedded fossils revealing the \nlife of past ages, contorted strata telling of \nancient cataclysms, dingy minerals that to \nthe unpracticed eye disguise precious metals, \nmines and mills in which metal is being \nobtained from ore—these field exhibits are \nmore effective than the most adequate lec\xad\ntures and class-room illustrations. At the \nactual geological formations, the authorities \nwho have made intensive studies of the local \ngeology can lecture, advise and lead the \nfield trips. The close contact between the \nundergraduate students and the professors \nand experienced geologists develops for the \nstudent an appreciation of the methods of \ngeological research. Similarly the future \nwill probably find traveling schools a part \nof the educational systems of many cities \nand States and most universities. The \nfloating universities that allow students to \nstudy while circling the globe are one phase \no f the movement.\nRecord Earthquake\nOn Sunday,May 22,1927,there occurred one \nof the most severe earthquakes on record. \nIt was noted not by cable or radio but by \nthe vibrations in the earth which it caused. \nWithin eighteen hours experts of the United \nStates Coast and Geodetic Survey in Wash\xad\nington, using data collected by Science \nService from seismograph observatories \nthroughout the world, had determined that \nthe earthquake had occurred in the Kansu \nProvince of China. It was so severe that \nit was calculated that thousands must have \nbeen killed. But so remote is Kansu Prov\xad\nince that it took two months for a con\xad\nfirmation to reach the outside world. Then \nonly meager details filtered through war- \nridden China, but it w&3 learned that the\ndisaster had resulted in the loss of 100,000\n", '98 CURRENT HISTORY, OCTOBER, 1927\nlives. In 1920 an even more severe earth\xad\nquake occurred in the Kansu region, when\n500,000 people were killed. Two such severe \nearthquakes occurring at such short inter\xad\nvals in approximately the same area sets \na seismological record. Never before, so \nfar as records show, have two such severe \nshocks in the same region occurred so close \ntogether. In the case of the second earth\xad\nquake, the first wave was recorded on the \nseismograph at Georgetown University, \nWashington, fourteen minutes after it \nstarted in China. The second wave was be\xad\ngun ten minutes later. Washington is \nabout 7,000 miles from Kansu. The shock \nwas also recorded at Manila, which is about \n2,200 miles away. Here the first wave ar\xad\nrived seven minutes after the shock and the \nsecond nine minutes after that. As seis\xad\nmologists have studied many earthquakes in \nthe past, they compiled tables from which \nthe distances from a seismograph can be de\xad\ntermined by the difference in time of ar\xad\nrival of the two waves. When they are \nabout nine minutes apart it indicates that \nthe distance is about 2,200 miles, but when \nthe difference is ten minutes, the scientists\nknow that the earthquake is about 7,000 \nmiles from the instrument. The record of a \nsingle station can only locate the earth\xad\nquake on a circle at a certain distance. \nSometimes this circle may cross a region \nwhere earthquakes are frequent, and then \nit would seem probable that the shock oc\xad\ncurred there. However, when reports are \nreceived from several stations circles can \nbe drawn on the globe around each of them \nand the exact spot determined by the point \nof intersection. By such means the position \nof the Chinese earthquake is probably \nknown more accurately by American scien\xad\ntists than by the Chinese themselves. About \nfifteen earthquake stations in the United \nStates and Canada and foreign places as \nfar away as Samoa, Philippine Islands, \nSitka, Alaska and England use telegraph, \nradio or cable to send reports o f records or \nshocks to Science Service in Washington. \nIn cooperation with Commander N. II. \nHeck of the United States Geodetic Coast \nSurvey and the Rev. James B. Macelwane \nof the Jesuit Seismological Association, \nthese reports are interpreted and the loca\xad\ntion of the earthquake discovered.\nTEXT OF SIR ARTHUR KEITH’S ADDRESS\nON DARWINISM\nThe following is the complete text of what has been pronounced to be a \nmost important scientific document— the address on “Darwin’s Theory of Man’s \nDescent as It Stands Today," delivered by Sir Arthur Keith, as President of the \nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science, at its meeting at Leeds, \nEngland, on Aug. 31, 1927:\nFIFTY-FIVE years have come and gone \nsince Charles Darwin wrote a history \nof man’s descent. How does his work \nstand the test of time?\nIn tracing the course of events -which led \nup to our present conception of man’s ori\xad\ngin, no place could serve as a historical \nstarting point so well as Leeds. In this city \nwas fired the first verbal shot of that long \nand bitter strife which ended in the over\xad\nthrow of those who defended the biblical \naccount o f man’s creation and in a victory \nfor Darwin.\nOn Sent. 24, 1858—sixty-nine years ago— \nthe British Association assembled in this \ncity just as we do tonight; Sir Richard \nOwen, the first anatomist of his age, stood \nwhere I now stand. He had prepared a \nlong address, four times the length of the \none I propose to read, and surveyed, as he \nwas well qualified to do, the whole realm \nof science; hut only those parts which con\xad\ncern man’s origin require our attention now. \nHe cited evidence which suggested a much \nearlier date for the appearance of man on \nearth than was sanctioned by biblical rec\xad\nords, but poured scorn on the Idea that \nman was merely a transmuted ape. He de\xad\nclared to the assembled association that the \ndifferences between man and ape were so \ngreat that it was necessary, in his opinion, \nto assign mankind to an altogether separate \norder in the animal kingdom. As this state\xad\nment fell from the President’s lips there \n■was at least one man in the audience whose \nspirit of opposition was roused — Thomas \nHenry Huxley, Owen’s young and rising an\xad\ntagonist.\nI  have picked out Huxley from the audi\xad\nence because it is necessary for the develop\xad\nment of my theme that we should give him \nour attention for a moment. We know \nwhat Huxley’s feelings were toward Owen \nat the date of the Leeds meeting. Six \nmonths before, he had told his sister that \n“ an internecine feud rages between Owen \nand myself,”  and on the eve of his depar\xad\nture for Leeds he wrote to Hooker: "The \ninteresting question arises: Shall I have a \nrow with the great O. there?”  I am glad \nto say the Leeds meeting passed off ami\xad\ncably, but it settled in Huxley’s mind what\n']</pre>
