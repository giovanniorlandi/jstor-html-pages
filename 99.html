The Dutch company nationalization policy in 1958 had a broad \nimpact in various fields related to the economic, political, and socio-cultural \naspects. Due to the presence of anti-foreign phenomena as the efforts to \nescape from the grip of the West, it increasingly supported the public \nresponses in no time. Various social and cultural actions happened in many \nplaces, just like a nationalization process continuation. Thousands of Dutch \npeople were expelled from the Republic of Indonesia, accompanied by \nvarious demonstrations performed by workers and artists, making the \natmosphere tense. The Dutch government got angry and felt offended by \nthe actions committed by the citizens. What forms of socio-cultural actions \ntook place after the nationalization of Dutch companies in 1958? This study \naimed to obtain in-depth pictures of various forms of socio-cultural actions \nperformed by wider communities (especially workers and cultural actors) \nin the context of nationalization in Indonesia. This study used a library \nmethod by tracing primary and secondary data sources and analyzing them \nafter testing the validity. The research results show that the format of sociocultural\nactions tended to be in mass mobilization and debates in \nparliaments and mass media. \n1 Introduction \nAfter the nationalization of Dutch companies in the late 1950s in Indonesia, sociocultural\nresponses have been frequently forgotten in many discussion topics. Moreover, the \n1950s decade was also known as the disappearing decade due to the bad stereotypes given \nby the New Order rulers [1]. However, some argued that in the 1950s, a dynamic democratic \nstruggle happened, and then people can now evaluate whether that era was categorized as a \ngolden or dark era [2]. The research conducted by Remco Raben focuses on the presence of \nhigh awareness and enthusiasm from both national and local elites for the nation's \ndevelopment in the 1950s, although without the realization of promises to Democracy and \neconomy [3]. Meanwhile, Nasrun Hamdani showed the importance of highlighting the role \nof local culture in the 1950s as one integrative factor. Nasrun took Sauti, a Malay cultural \nactivist, as his research subject [4]. \n \n    Corresponding author: wwardojowaskito@gmail.com \nE3S Web of Conferences 317, 01010 (2021)\nICENIS 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf /202131701010\n  Â© The Authors,  published  by EDP Sciences.

Many quality and substantive debates occurred to find the \nsolutions to specific problems as if not affected by the people\'s weak economic conditions \nafter the independence wars. \nApart from the above categories, at the end of the 1950s until the middle of the 1960s, \nit was crucial for Indonesian history after Soekarno dismissed the Constituent Assembly, \nreturned to the 1945 Constitution, and declared the implementation of guided Democracy. \n"The Revolution is not finished" and "Politics is the Commander" had become Sukarno\'s \npowerful slogans to gain the people\'s sympathy to support his policies. The anti-foreign \nphenomena reached the climax along with policies nationalizing the Dutch companies and \nretaking West Irian. Law no. 86 the Year 1958 on the Nationalization of Dutch Companies \ntriggered various reactions from the Indonesian workers, artists, and writers [5]. \nThis paper focused on explaining the expression formats of both public components. It \nwas known that since the early 1950s, the workers had urged the government to cancel the \nRound Table Conference (known as Konferensi Meja Bundar) results considered more \nfavourable for the Dutch and weakened the Indonesian economy. The Labor Union (Serikat \nBuruh) took over the Dutch companies in various parts before implementing the \nnationalization policy. The military involved in this case was the Army taking over these \ncompanies. Even after implementing the Nationalization Law, the Labor Union continuously \nurged the government to postpone the Foreign Investment Law [6]. In this situation, the state \nis declared in a state of military emergency so that the military has the authority to take some \nstrategic policies [7]. Meanwhile, the contribution of artists and writers is also significant in \nfiguring out the Indonesian cultural identity. The relationship between literature, writers, and \nauthority in the 1950s was also influential, marked by various important debates shown in \nvarious mass media [8].   \n2 Method \nThis research used a historical method consisting of heuristics, criticisms, \ninterpretations, and historiography [9]. Heuristics means collecting sources from the \nconcerned eras in printed materials and relevant written sources [10]. This method was \ncombined with the library method relying on the tracing of both primary and secondary \nsources. The tracing was performed to various institutions having some accountable online \ndatabases so that the digital tracing processes were also still accountable. The data sources \nand reference tracing were performed in the national library and both Indonesian and Dutch \nNational Archives.  \n3 Results and Discussion  \n3.1. Forms of Social Actions Made by Workers after Nationalization \nWorkers acted as the economic and company operation driver and had the power as a \npressure group, especially those joining as the members of Labor Unions. They frequently \nmade demonstrations affecting the political or social world at both regional and national \nlevels. Dutch company workers made various movements or coordination as the members of \nseveral regional Labor Unions or those affiliated with specific organizations. When \nperforming their actions, these workers can damage the company\'s orders. \nThe workers\' actions started long before the Dutch company nationalization policy was \nintroduced in 1958. From the early 1950s to 1957, various actions made by the labour unions \nE3S Web of Conferences 317, 01010 (2021)\nICENIS 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf /202131701010\n2\n', 'from various companies had put political pressure on business people, parliament and \ngovernment. The number of Dutch companies taken over by labour unions at the end of 1957 \nhad reached 700 companies spread throughout Indonesia. 70% of foreign companies \noperating in Indonesia. Since there were many nationalization actions, the ownership of 90% \nof plantation production had been transferred to the Indonesian government, including 60% \nforeign trade values and about 246 factories, mining, banking, shipping, and other service \nsectors [11]. \nThe labour unions previously working for the Dutch banks had made coordination \nbefore taking over the companies. When the discourse on the nationalization of the Indonesia \nBank developed, the labour unions had urged the government to perform the nationalization. \nThe other actions made by the bank labour unions related to the nationalization happened in \nJakarta. These actions took place earlier than those that happened at Indonesia Bank. These \nworkers\' actions taking place in several Dutch banks were longer and more complicated due \nto the challenges given by their superintendents [12]. \nThe workers joining as the members of SBBSI (All Indonesia Bank Labor Unions) had \ntaken over Dutch-owned banks in Jakarta, such as NHM (Nederlandsch \nHandelmaatschappij) and Escompto. These actions were challenged by the directors of \nDutch banks, arguing that the acquisition was illegal because their assets should have been \nacquired or controlled by the military in accordance with the instructions given by the \nminister of defense. The workers\' movement to nationalize the assets, apart from taking over, \nwas also provoked by closing the bank names and replacing them with the writing mentioning \nthat Indonesia had owned the bank. This movement caused the customers to panic, and \nmassive money-taking actions were made at that time [13]. \nThe The workers\' actions were quite solid to support the nationalization and programs \nmade by the government by making strikes. The strikes made by the labour unions were \nintended to show their strength, solidarity and weaken the company\'s bargaining position. \nThe labour unions in Surabaya held a strike. The workers still went to work, but they did not \ndo any working activity. The strike in Surabaya was made peacefully. This strike was \nperformed in the Dutch-owned and joint-venture companies to support the liberation of West \nIrian. \nSOBSI also initiated the mass labour strike, a labour union affiliated with the Indonesian \nCommunist Party (PKI/Partai Komunis Indonesia). The workers\' organs hardly and loudly \nopposed various foreign/Dutch activities [14]. On 30 November 1957, it was reported that \nmany Dutch companies in Indonesia were taken over by the workers, most of whom were \naffiliated with the Indonesian Communist Party. However, in the view of Kartini, as the \nInformation Council, she denied that this strike was infiltrated by communist organizations \nor ideologies [15]. \nThe voices of workers in this nationalization program were not entirely performed with \n"street action", but with their diplomatic power and pressure affecting the decisions made by \nthe government and companies. The 6th Metal Industrial Labor Union Congress resulted in \ndemands for nationalization and increased labour wages [16]. \nBased on the increasingly corporate takeover phenomena, there were two different \nviews, especially related to who made the initiative to take action, purely by the workers or \nbased on the orders given by the government. The first view said that the workers\' actions \nwere unplanned and not related to the government programs. Meanwhile, the second view \nsaid that, based on the reality found in the field, those companies were indeed taken over \nbased on the government orders to be placed under the state supervision [17]. PM Juanda \nseems to follow the second opinion, saying that the Dutch made a reactive action on the \ntakeover. There were indications of capital movements or transfers of Dutch assets out of \nIndonesia secretly by the Dutch entrepreneurs. Apart from those indications, there was a \nsocial impact resulting from the takeover of these companies, such as the repatriation of \nE3S Web of Conferences 317, 01010 (2021)\nICENIS 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf /202131701010\n3\n', "Dutch citizens from Indonesia. Until August 1958, approximately 35,500 Dutch citizens were \nrepatriated, and only around 6,000 Dutch citizens still stayed in Indonesia.  \n3.2 The Role of Artists and writers at the End of 1950s to 1966  \nWhat What was the role of artists and writers in responding to the political atmosphere \nin Indonesia from the late 1950s to 1966? The role of artists in those years could not be \nseparated from the debates between the People's Arts Institute (Lekra) and Cultural Manifesto \nin the early 1960s. The first group was an artist institution affiliated with the Indonesian \nCommunist Party (known as PKI/Partai Komunis Indonesia), emerging in the early 1950s \nand introduced socialist realism based on Marxist thoughts. Lekra was initially driven by 15 \nwriters, including Joebaar Ajoeb, A.S. Dharta, MS. Ashar, Herman Arjuno, Pramoedya \nAnanta Toer, and Njoto. This group seemed to be a buffer institution for Soekarno regime in \nsupporting socialist ideas, including when the government issued a nationalized Dutch \ncompany in 1958. Lekra used the folk culture concept as a form of its struggle. People's \nculture, in this case, was understood as a representative of a wider community oppressed by \nDutch imperialism. Lekra positioned itself as an anti-colonial institution in various forms \nboth through the influences of foreign ideologies and economic and political fields. Thus, the \nstate that the Indonesian people supported by Lekra would form was the People's Democratic \nRepublic. The people were given the freedom to manage the independence of the economy, \nindustry, and arts by relying on people through revolution [18]. For Lekra, the way was for \nIndonesian people and the members of the international community, especially farmers and \nworkers. According to the Lekra preamble in 1950 and renewed at the Lekra Congress in \nSolo in 1959, the people's culture serves as the struggling ammunition to destroy global \nimperialism and capitalism. \nLekra had the jargons, such as Arts for Public [Seni untuk Rakyat], Politics is the \nCommander [Politik adalah Panglima], Expanding and Escalating [Meluas dan Meninggi], \nand Down-Going Movement [Gerakan Turun ke Bawah]. Soekarno's revolutionary ideas \nseemed to be interpreted as arts for politics to become artists and writers who supported \nSoekarno [19]. Lekra had the vehicles as the narrative publishers covering Harian \nRakjat and Bintang Timur as a political and ideological organ. The Harian \nRakjat Newspaper published poems or opinions made by the artists and observers who \nsupported Lekra. Meanwhile, Bintang Timur had a rubric called Lentera which became the \nrubric for publishing literary works in the past. \nMeanwhile, several writers, such as Wiratmo Soekito, HB Jassin, and Goenawan \nMohamad, were driven by the cultural manifesto. This group consisted of artists bringing \ntheir ideas, criticizing the government, and rejecting the ideas of socialist realism [20]. The \ninitiators of the Cultural Manifesto emerging in 1963 consisted of 16 writers, 3 painters and \n1 composer. In general, the artists were still young at the average of 20 years old with minimal \nexperience. The painters had never had a solo exhibition, while the writers had not yet \nproduced poems and books. With this declaration, the group was called a counterrevolution, \na stamp for committing crimes in the past [21]. The initial idea of the Cultural Manifesto was \nwritten as follows. \nWe, Indonesian artists and intellectuals, hereby announce a Cultural manifesto \nstating our national culture establishment, ideals and politics. For us, culture is a \nstruggle to improve the human life conditions. We don't prioritize one cultural \nsector above others: Each sector fights together for that culture in accordance with \ntheir nature. In performing our national culture, we try to honestly and sincerely \ncreate our works as a struggle to maintain and develop our dignity as Indonesian \npeople in the middle of the nationsâ peoples. Pancasila is our cultural philosophy \n[22]. \nE3S Web of Conferences 317, 01010 (2021)\nICENIS 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf /202131701010\n4\n", " \nLater, Goenawan Mohamad considered the idea of the Cultural Manifesto entirely \ncreated by Wiratmo Soekito to be humanist and aimed at expressing art independence, yet \nloose [23]. However, the Cultural Manifesto group, which was initially opposed to Lekra, \nalso seemed to enter the political area, although, in the beginning, they were not involved in \npolitics. Choosing not to be involved in politics was a political attitude. As stated by HB \nJassin, the foundation of the Cultural Manifesto group was religious morality. It did not \nchoose either left or right party and only adhered to humanity [24]. Cultural Manifesto with \nUniversal Humanism leaned towards the Western world without tracing the local traditions. \nIf Lekra was supported by a strong political party (Indonesian Communist Party known \nas PKI) at that time, the Cultural Manifesto was then supported by the military, in this case, \nthe Army. In this context, their debates could not be separated from the struggle for discourse \nspace to influence wider communities. When illustrated as a battlefield, the Indonesian \nCommunist Party, known as PKI, fought against the military, while the workers and artists \nwere behind those actions. Soekarno then banned all activities of Manikebu (a named \nCultural Manifesto) in 1964 because there was no other manifesto besides the political \nmanifesto. The debates between Lekra and Manikebu became political issues. They were not \ntexts stated in the Cultural Manifesto at the agenda of the Indonesian Writers Conference \n(known as KPPI/Konferensi Karyawan Pengarang Indonesia) in March 1964. With military \nsupports, the event was successfully held. However, it did not meet the target since \nthe Lekra group increased their attack intensity against Manikebu, which was led by a \nmilitary intelligence named Wiratmo Soekito [25]. \n4 Results and Discussion  \nThe The responses given by the worker's community in Indonesia had occurred since \nthe movement era. They even continued until the formation of the Republic of Indonesia by \nparticipating in the wars against colonialism through various ways and strategies in \naccordance with their functions as factory or local or foreign company workers. Artists and \nwriters had also contributed to supporting independence. When the capital was moved from \nJakarta to Yogyakarta, the artists also moved and performed various artistic acts as a form of \nsupport for the state, including various works and writings in the form of poetries, novels, \npaintings, and even posters containing provocative invitations or agitations to fight against \nthe Dutch colonialism. \nThe role of workers, artists, and writers in the 1950s and middle of the 1960s was crucial \nin the Indonesian national journey. Fierce debates between Lekra, Manikebu, and other \ngroups must be seen as an effort to form a national cultural identity with a broad-minded and \nnon-partisan. The nationalization of foreign/Dutch companies was only one part of episodes \nthat all elements of a sovereign nation must pass. \nThe socialist cultural identity promoted by Lekra failed following the political events \non 30 September 1965. Due to the regime changes from Soekarno to Suharto in 1966, the \ncultural climate became contradictory and no longer leaning towards communism-socialism \nbut idealism in creating a new culture based on the new values and abandoning the old ones. \nThe nationalism of the 1950s was understood by artists and intellectuals with the same \nidea known as the Indonesian-ness reconstruction or rebuilding Indonesia after the 1965 civil \nwar by especially considering the implications of events on 30 September 1965, which caused \ndeep and severe wounds for both parties. The debates between Lekra and Manikebu group \nwere similar to those in the Cultural Polemic occurring before the independence. However, \nall parties aimed at laying the foundation for the Indonesian-ness identity, orientation, and \nconstruction. This included the actions of workers who made agitation and demand against \nthe government and the contestation of artists and writers in the 1950s to 1960s. The demand \nE3S Web of Conferences 317, 01010 (2021)\nICENIS 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf /202131701010\n5\n", 'of the Labor Union to the government to nationalize the Dutch companies received a positive \nresponse. A legal basis was created and ratified through this institution, including the \nproposed Law Draft on the Nationalization of Dutch Companies. \nMeanwhile, the Dutch did not expect Indonesia to repatriate thousands of its citizens \nfrom Indonesia as part of the nationalization of Dutch companies and political pressure as \nstrategies to seize West Irian. The arrival of thousands of citizens previously living \ncomfortably in Indonesia made the Dutch overwhelmed in providing jobs. Thousands of its \ncitizens were forced to become workers and unskilled labourers, the professions they had \nnever imagined before, a job that was frequently ridiculed and avoided when they were in \nIndonesia.  \nAcknowledgement \nIn this opportunity, the writer would like to thank DIRSIMLITABMAS for the supports and funding \nunder the Research for Doctoral Dissertation Program (225-06/UN7.6.1/PP2021). \nReferences \n1.
