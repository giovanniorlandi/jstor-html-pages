Upon examination it was found\nthat the bullet entered his back and\ncame out at his breast. Not sufficient\nproof was gathered to lay the crime\nupon a particular person, but opinions\nwere expressed, based upon previous\nevents. The jury rendered a verdict,\nstating that Melson came to his death\nfrom a gunshot wound fired by an un\nknown party.\nTom Melson had the reputation of\nbeing a dangerous, quarrelsome man,\nand the people of the neighborhood\nwhere lie lived were generally afraid\nof him.\nlie was about fifty years old. About\nthirty years ago he shot and killed a\nman in his neighborhood named Tom\nSmith, and immediately thereafter he\nfled the country, going to Texas.\nFive or six years ago he returned to\nAdair county and after a long hunt\nhe was caught by the Sheriff, lodged\nin jail, the charge against him being\nmurder. During the years that in\ntervened between the time be killed\nSmith and his trial, some of the im\nportant witnesses had died and others\nhad left the county, and when his\ntrial came on thece was not proof\nsufficient to convict him and fie went\nfree.\nSince the acquittal verdict he was a\ngreat disturber in the community,\nand there are no regrets on account of\nhis passing, but the manner in which\nhe was slain is condemned.\nCome to the foot ball game next\nSaturday at Lindsey-Wilson, Spring\nfield vs. L.

There are, besides, simi\nlar areas in the extreme north\nern section of the North Ameri\ncan continent, in the vicinity of\nHudson bay, and again in Lab\nrador. The interior of Brazil has sev\neral large unexplored areas, and\nthere are similar areas to the\nsouthward.

The largest lies in\nthe Sahara, while the central\npart of the Dark continent to the\nsouthward offers many opportu\nnities for exploration.\nDespite the antiquities of civ\nilization in Asia, much remains\nto be done by the geographer.\nThere are several unexplored\nareas in Arabia, as well as in\nChina, and especially in northern\nSiberia.

"If your right hand\noffend you, cut it off," was no idle in\njunction, but means the offense should\nbe removed rather than the mutila\ntion of the member.\nOur Tax Laws are distasteful and\ndetrimental, but the remedy should be\nto amend them instead ol allowing\nthem to undermine the morals of the\npeople by openly disregarding them.\nThe successful evasion of one Law\nmay encourage the violation of others\nand in time breed a contempt for all\nLaws.\nWhile every citizen owes obedience\nto the Laws, the Laws should be made\nfair and equal to every citizen.\nThe Tax Laws are neither fair nor\nequal and are productive of deceit and\ndishonor and if for no other reason\nthan this should be changed.\nUNIFORM TAXATION.\nProperty differs so greatly in char\nacter and earning power it has always\nbeen impossible to tax the various\nkinds uniformly. Every attempt to\ntax movable property the same as im\nmovable property has failed and will\nalways fail. "Two wrongs do not\nmake a right," and when assessors\nfind it impossible to discover the own\nership of movable property and under\ntake to square things by lowering the\nassessment of immovable property,\nthere is no right or justice in it and\neverybody suffers in mind and matter.\nThe more stringent the Law to un\ncover movable property the faster it\nmoves and hides, and this fact is so\nwell established the assessors in most\ncounties let movable property go by\ndefault. So-called Uniform taxation\nIs a delusion and a snare. It may\nsuffice to fool the ignorant, but the\nknowing ones just laugh at it This\nis rough on the poor man whose all\nis in sight and immovable, and is also\ntough on the rich man who defies the\nlaw and hides his wealth from the\nassessor, for he knows he is doubly\nguilty in saving himself at the ex\npense of his less fortunate neighbor.\nEQUITABLE TAXATION.\nThe differences in property call for\ndifferences in taxation just as "one\nstar differs from another," and yet all\nthe stars and all the property serve\ntheir purposes. The man who puts\nhis money in Securities issued on\nproperty already taxed and paying\nmore taxes because of the improve\nments justified by the man\'s money,\nIs just as useful a citizen as the man\nwho puts his money in lands and\nhouses; but when the first man ob\njects to giving up the greater part of\nthe earnings on his securities, issued\non property already taxed, he Is\nlooked upon as a tax dodger, and the\nman with the houses and lands who\ncannot so readily escape denounces a\ntax system which seems so unfair. Ask\nthis man to surrender a half to three\nfourths of the income from his houses\nand lands and there would be another\ntale. Tne revenue of the first man\nis limited, while that of the other is\nunlimited, and yet there are people\nwho cannot see the distinction. Equit\nable taxation is based on the earning\npower of all property, in just propor\ntion, and if any partiality is shown it\nshould be in favor of the man who\nrisks his money to improve houses and\nlands owned by others, which may\ndepreciate, but cannot fly away.\nI\nTAX AMENDMENT.\nThe Tax Amendment was carried\nby thirty thousand majority two years\nago, but because the Secretary of\nState failed to advertise it ninety in\nstead of sixty days before the elec\ntion, as the Constitution requires, it\nmust be voted on again at the Novem\nber Election. The welfare of the\nState demands the re-adoption of this\nimportant measure and every fair\nminded citizen should vote for it.\nKENTUCKY NEEDS\nA good many things\' to place the\nSlate in the rank she deserves in the\nmarch of prosperity, but when sifted\ndown the greatest need of all is a\nnew Tax System that will attract in\nstead of repel Capital, which guaran\ntees cheap money for the improve\nment of farms and development of\nlocal industries. Although one of the\noldest States, centrally located and\nwith marvelous natural advantages,\nother and less favored States have out\nstripped us, and, as someone has aptly\nsaid, "Kentucky is an Island of com\nparative poverty surrounded by a Sea\nof industrial prosperity." And why?\nThe answer is because of our repellent\nTax System. Equitable taxation\nmeans cheap money. Easy money\nmeans improvement and development\nIndustrial enterprise keeps the people\nat home and increases the population.\nMore people means more consumers\nof our home products. Close markets\nmeans good prices, and all of this\nhas been retarded because some wise\nacres borrowed a soalled Unlf\nTax Law from another -State which\nhad been striving to get rid of it for\nforty years and which shows that an\nIntolerant politician may not always\nbe a tolerable patriot, or Kentucky\nwould not have been throttled in the\nway she has been.\nDON\nT FAIL TO VOTE\nFOR\n. i\n(\njTHE TAX AMENDMENT\n"I Don\'t Feel Good"\nThat is what a lot of people tell us.\nUsually theirbowels only need cleansing.\nwill do the trick and make you feel fine.\nWe know this positively.

Ad\nFrom Georgia.\nMoultrie, Ga., Oct. 18, 1915.\nEditor News:\nDear friends and readers of\nthe News: This finds me in the\nSunny South where the fields are\nwhite with cotton. Cotton pick\ning is the order of the day. Cot\nton is bringing a splendid price.\nLong cotton is worth 26 cents a\npound, short cotton is worth 1 1\ncents to 12 cents a pound.\nIt has been very dry down\nhere, but raining now. Creeks\nhave been dried up, and water\nhas been very scarce.\nCorn crops are good, but cot\nton crops areshort. Sugar cane\ncrop is almost a failure.\nI want to say to the teachers\nthat want- to come to Georgia\nthat you had better, hold your\njob at home, for the schools are\nfiHwl this yearwith Georgia\nteachers. I will find a job for\nmyself as I am here early, but\nyou will fail if you come. Ken\ntucky and Tennessee teachers\nwill have to look somewhere else\nfor a school after this year, for\nthey are supplying their own\nteachers with schools.\nThis will be my last year down\nhere as the work is being sup\nplied with home teachers.\nSchools are beginning earlier\nthan common. Most all schools\nwill be running by X-mas.\nI have found the best counties\nhave employed their teachers\nsome time ago.\nI do not know just where I\nwill be located yet.\nI have failed to get any hear\ning from home since I have been\nhere. I have written several let\nters, but nothing in return.\nI wish all the good people in\nKentucky a happy time.\nI will write more later.\nYours truly,\nJames 0. Prock.\nWhen Baby Has the Croup.\nWhen a mother is awakened from\nsound sleep to find her child who has\ngone to bed apparently in the best of\nhealth struggling for breath, she is\nnaturally alarmed. Yet if she can\nkeep her presence of mind and give\nChamberlain\'s Cough Kemedy every\nten minutes until vomiting is produced\nquick relief will follow and the child\nwill drop to sleep to awaken in the\nmorning as well as ever. This remedy\nhas been in use for many years with\nuniform success. Obtainable at\nPaull Drug Co. Ad\nHow Fish Carry Young.\nIt has been supposed that the\nkangaroo had the monopoly of\ncarrying its babies in a pouch.\nIt has been discovered, however,\nthat a fish has the same useful\nreceptacle. The pipe-fishh, as\nit is called, from the length of\nits jaws, has a pocket on the\nunder side of its body nearly half\nits length. It is found in the\nmale species only, and is the only\npart of its body which is unpro\ntected by large flat plates, which\ntake the place of scales in its\nprotective .armor.\nIf a pipe-fish is taken from the\nwater and its little ones shaken\nout of the pouch bach into the\nwater they always seem either\nunable or disinclined to run away.\nBut if the father is placed in the\nwater again, all the small fish\nimmediately swim back into the\npouch. These curious little crea\ntures have prehensile tails, which\nthey use to hold on to the sea\nweed to prevent themselvel be\ning about a foot in length and\nan inch in thickness. But, un\nlike the eel, it has a very long\njaw and the peculiar defensive\nniijaJraj,nentionfd.\nHENRY W. DEPP,\nDENTISTI\nAm permanently located in Col\nlumbia.\nAll Classes of Dental work done.
