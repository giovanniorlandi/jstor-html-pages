C. Sept. 30. -Th\nInterior Department lias Just hnnded\ndown n decision, holding all mineral\nleases In the Creek Nntlon thus far\nnegotiated for cancellation. The decls\nion is far-reaching in its effect. ns it\nIs a severe blow to the capitalists In\nKansas Cltv St. Louis nnd other\nwestern ti.v. who have invested\nlorge sums of money In the develop\nment or the oil and coal field in that\nNation.\nPrior to the enactment of the Creek\ntreaty, oil and conl lenses had been\nsecured nnd largo sums of money spont\nIn developing conl nnd oil proportion.\nA number of vnluablo coal mines are\nnow in operation in tho vicinity of\nHed Fork nnd oil wells nro bolng sunk\nli tho same locality. The operations\nat present aro going on under con\ntracts made with members of the Na\ntion who havo made their selection.\nThose selections, however, havo not\nbeen approved by the Dawes commls\nMon. and probably will not for sis\nmonths to come. Patents to tho al\nlottees will bo Issued sometlmo wltn\nin the next year, but until this occur?\nno Individual leases for the mining of\ncoal and oil aro of any validity what\never.\nThis announcement will bo a sur\nprise to the mombors of tho Creek\nNation who have mado their solea\ntlon as well as to capitalists who have\nInvested largo sums of money In do\nvoloplng tho mineral lands of tho\nNation.\nTho refusal of the department to\napprovo any mineral lenses is in ac\'\ncordanco with the provisions of the\nCieok treaty which wns nogotintod\nbetween the Dawes commission ail\nthe tribal authorities a year ago and\nfinally ratified by the Crook council\nlast May. Tho treaty makes a special\npi o vision for the renting of agricul\ntural lands whore tho allotteos havo\nmado tbclr selections, but expressly\nprohibits tho taking of any mlnorals\nfrom tho property until nfter tho al\nlotments have been completed and\ntho patontB havo boon Issued by the\nallottees. The taking of minerals from\nthe lands has always boon held to be\na portion of the lenity, and just in\nproportion as tlto coal and oil Is re\nmoved tho value of tho property di\nminishes. As tho mombers of tho\nCreek Nation cannot bo bound by a\nmere selection of land or a declara\ntion of Intent to tako n certain allot\nment n lease for the particular tract\nof land that they may select is of no\nvalidity until tho tltlo passes. All\nmining operations, therefore, In the\nCreek Nation must stop and all mlnert\ndeveloped thus far will revert to tho\nallottee who secures tho particular\ntract of land upon which tho improve\nments aro made.\nNo leases can bo renewed until af\nter the allotments havo been complet\ned. Even then lenses can only bo\nmado for a period of ono year. Thoy\nmust first be negotiated with tho al\nlcttce ami later approved by tho See\nrotary of the Interior boforo they be\ncomo effective. Thus it nppoars that all\nmining operations In tho Crook Nation\nmust ceaso for at leaBt a period of\none year, and tholr ronownl nfter that\ntime will dopond entirely upon tho de\ncision ot the Secretary of tho In\nterior. This decision will undoubtedly re\nsult in much litigation, ns tho capital\nists who havo Invested money in the\nCreek Nation will undoubtedly con\ntend that as tho pooplo of tho CwoU\nNntlon nre eltlxons of tho United\nStatos nnd nre entitled to all th\nprivileges nnd rights of citizenship,\ntho npproval of contracts by the Soc\nrotary of tho Interior is unnecessary.\nIt seems almost certain that tin\ncourts will bo-asked to decide defi\nnitely and finally the oxact moaning o\ntho recent act or eongross bostowln.;\ncitizenship upon all of tho people ol\nthe Indian Torrltory. If tho court\nshould hold that tho mombors of tin\nFive Civilized Tribes aro citizens of\ntho United Statos, In fact and in\nlaw, thon It Is doubtful whethor the\nSecrotnry of the Interior can oxorclao\na supervisory authority over them,\nas the net of congress giving him this\nsupervisory power Is limited to mem\nbers of tho Indian tribes.\nAlready a number of lenses have\nbeen entered Into for tho mining of\nconl and oil In tho Crook Nation anl\nsubmitted to the \'department for np\nproval.All of these lenses will be reject\ncd upon the grounds already stated\nand returned to tho companies and\npeople of the Nntlon.\nAGAIN AFTER EX-GOV. TAYLOR.\nGov. Durbln Promises to Answer Ap\npeals of Kentucklans Monday.\nIndlnnapolls, tlnd.. Sept. 30. Kon\ntuoky olIlclaj! today renewed Interest\nIn the shooting of Gov. Goobol by np\nponnng this nfternoon In the olllco of\nGov. Durnln to present for the second\ntime requisition papers cnllng for tho\nreturn to Kentucky of Wllllnm S. Tay\nlor and Chas. Flnley. After Goobol\nwns assassinated efforts were made\nto have both men returned to Ken\ntucky on the charge that thoy were\naccessories before the tact to Goe\nbei\'s murder.\nGov. Mount, who was then In office.\nrefused to grant the requisition on\ntho ground that the men would not\nreeolve tnlr and impartial trials wore\nthoy sent back to Kentucky.\nThe requisition presented todny was\nbrought by Mason II. P. Williams,\nchief 01 the police of Frankfort. Ac\ncompanying the chief of police wore\nF. It. GrUUths. of Cincinnati, and Ar\nthur (loobel, n brother of the murdor\ned man. With them nlgo welo a Mr.\nMlllls. of Cincinnati.\nTIr- Intervlow with Gov. Durbln was\nhold at noon. Attorney General Tai\nlor was called Into consultation. Those\npresent at the conference, however,\nrofused to divulge a word. At tho\nstatehouso and especially about the\nolllco ot tho chief executive, thoro is\na decided feeling that tho requisi\ntions are presented at this time In or\ndor to take advantage, politically, of\ntho feeling aroused by tho assasslna\ntlon ot President McKlnloy.\nEx-Gov. Taylor tonight rofused to\ndiscuss tho situation. Mr. Flnley,\nlikewise, was retlconr.\ncal dotccthes havo had both\nmen under surveillance for sovoral\ndays- Gov. Durbln has signified his\nintention of returning an nnswor to\nto tho requisition Monday.\nMONEY WENT FOR FIREWATER.\nNow\nNome Indians Are Said to Be\nAlmost Starving.\nPort Townsend, Wash., Sept. 30.\nAccording to reports from Nome\nbrought by tho steamer Oregon, the\nIndians of tho placo aro threatened\nwith starvation.\nDuring tho past few months about\n300 natives hnve visited Nome, bring\ning furs to trndo for supplies. As\nsoon as their goods were disposed of,\nhowever, whisky peddlers got among\nthem, nud thoy changed tho proceeds\nof their sales for liquor. The Indians\nhavo agalu camped on tho beach, gen\norally In a drunken stupor, allowing\ntho season to pass In which they could\nlay In supplies of fish for use during\nthe long winter period. Unless thoy\naro assisted by tho government, It Is\nsaid, suffering nnd starvation will\nsurely follow.\nDestttuto miners from outlying dls\ntrlcts aro arriving at Nomo. The\nUnited StateB steamer Dear on Au\ngust 31, landed elghteon men nt\nNome. These men wero found on tho\nbeach of Kotzobue Sound, penniless\nand out of supplies. They had for some\nmonths been dopondlng on what fish\nthey could catch and game thoy could\nkill. This party joined in tho rush to\nKotzobuo in 1898 and have been there\nevor since.
