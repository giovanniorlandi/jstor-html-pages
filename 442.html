Battersly, not having wen his\nsister in ten years, decided to spend\nChristmas at her house. A desultory\ncorrespondence had made him vaguely\naware of the fact tlr\'her husband, Cal\nvin Murdoch, had grown rich, and that\nshe had two children, a boy and a girl.\nBut ho wns not prepared for the luxuri\nant conditions which ho found upon en\ntering their splendid home. He was\nnever eatrnnged from his sister, but\nwhen she married Murdock the soldier\nbrotbor had mado up his mind that his\nsister\'s husband was not "his kind."\nIn frontier barracks and foreign camps,\nCol. Batlersly\'o life had been lonely,\nlie wns a silent, elemental, passionate\nman, whose rigid habits gave a cold and\novon hard exterior to a nature essential\nly tender.\nBut tho Murdocks gave Uncle Batlcr\nsly a grand welcome. His sister kissed\nhim, the two children gave him tholr\nhandswlth trained graclousncss, and the\nhead ot the house said: " Welcome to\nthe warrior see, the conquetlng lu-ro\ncomos!" This made the old campaigner\nill at ease. He blushed like a girl, and\nthereafter found restraint in tho, to\nhim, artificial atmosphere of the grand\nhouse.\nWhen the Christmas present b began\nto arrive, and his sister showed them to\nhim, the colonel suddenly realized that\nhe must buy something for the children.\nHe said nothing about It, but spent half\nof the next day buying for his r.leco a\nFrench doll, with a complete wardrobe,\nand a fully equipped steam battleship\nfor his nephew. It was a soldier\'s\ncholco love and a child for the little\nwoman, power and war for tho little\nman. "He was very careful about the\npddrpss, "Mrs. Murdock, 2 1 It Penrose\nstreet."\nHo wondered why his gifts did not\ncoon appear In the grand array, but said\nUcR f I\n0\nSPENT HALF AN HOUK BUYING A\nKUENC1I DOLL.\nnothing to his sister, showing each day\nan Increasing Interest In tho accumulat\ning profcents In tho locked room, and\nfinally, on Christmas ove, late In the\nday, (joinfC hack to tha store where he\nhad mado his purchaees to ask what\nbad become of tho doll and tho war\nship. It took a long time to find out the\nright man. but nt last a very polite\nclerk who had been answering queal!out\nas fnet as a dozen r-eoplo could ask them,\nturned to him and said:\n"Murdock? What address? Penrose\nstreet or Penrose avenue?"\n"Aro there both?" asked tho colonel,\nas the possible blunder dawned on him.\n"Yes; ono on the West side, one en\ntho South sldo. Where did you wish\nyour goods to go?"\nOf course, Penrose avenue Is on the\nSouth side and Ponroso street Is on tho\nWest side, and Col. Butlersly had blro\neelf made th mistake The pno-\'s had\nhoao railotfd fpt, the UrS told Mm.\nf fS\nv. .A\n1\nII V JOIIK ii. lurrnii\'n.\nIt was pretty lato to attempt &o:t\'H\nthem back, but they would try. \'Jul\ndark mado some notes, rattled oft a K m\nwords about the terrible rush i,-,i,\nolt and loft the colonel stit "g da;\nIn the crowd. He went home ond- i\nprecaution got out of his trunk i\nstrangely carved braeelol, ant.

And he took thom to\nMurdock, saying nothing of their r\nvalue, and said they were for her .-\'.\nand her boy. But after dinner that n;: \'.\nMr. Murdock tapped at the colom-l\'i\ndoor, saying:\n"I hope you won\'t think of givini\nthose rare curios to tho children, cob npl\nThey\'re worth their weight In money \'\n"Didn\'t cost mo a cent, Murdi tk,\nblurted the soldier.

It was a dirty, tumbieclovn\ncottage, built below grade and v,lih ,i\ncign "Fcr Sale" nailed to the rir! n -fenco.\nA thin woman, in an old, fau I\nwrapper, came to tho door.\n"I came to seo if "\n"Oh, I knew soraobody ud come," sho\ninterrupted him. "I knew thoy warn t\nfor us, sir won\'t you como In?"\nlie stepped into the dingy room nnd\nsaw a big-eyed, frail girl of seven f i\'\nl\'.ng the great French doll.\n"You seo. sir." said tho won,-\'\nbreathless to explain, "the things r -whllo\nI was out I work over at the .\nfactory, and my name is Murphy. r\nand when the things come nobody v.i\nhome, sir, but Mamie and tho boy. ! \'s\nmine, and he\'s out there bow r!:n -\nj with th\' steamboat, and when the v. v i\ncame, airs, rracy, sue lives In th( v -\nblock, she seen It, and she ran over cr j\ntigncd a book, and tho driver jinn; i\non his wagon and went away, ai. ! oj\ncourse, the children seeu the burrba\nan\' nothln\' would do but they must open\n\'em.
