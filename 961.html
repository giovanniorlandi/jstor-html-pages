to go Anywhere with a load\nnow in Powell county is nothing\nbut vexation and worry When\na man puts a load on his wagon\nthat one horse can easily pull on\ngood roads and starts off to town\n5 miles away with four horses\nhooked up and then gets stalled\nbefore ho goes a quart or ofa\nmile and has to pull every mus\ncle in his body trying at the\nhind wheel to help his team and\nthen cant go he gets mad and\nx Usually a few cuss words will\nl slip out of his lips and generally\na whole lot of them will let go\nNow if the roads had been smooth\nand hard the man could get to\ntown and back in half the time\nwith half the team and have no\ncause to think of using a single\ncuss word\nThen again if the unnecessary\ntime and labor used in getting o\nVcr our bad roads were only used\nIn getting them good we would\nnot have such terrible experienc\nI es in getting into town with a\nload The expense would be\nnot so much in the long run and\nthe hauling would be a pleasure\nWe all now
