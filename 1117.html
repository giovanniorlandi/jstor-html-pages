The assembly was \ncordially acclaimed hy the press of both \ncountries. Another conference of note \nwas that concluded on July 26 at Riga, \nwhich was attended by representatives \nof Esthonia, Latvia and Russia; the en\xad\nactment of a railway convention was\nthe purpose of the meeting, which was \ndeclared to have been successful. It was \nannounced in Latvia that two treaties \nof commerce had been signed, one with \nAustria on Aug. 9 and one with Norway \non Aug. 14. Both treaties were based \non the most favored nation clause and \nincluded provisions for special privi\xad\nleges to the Baltic States and Russia.\nOther Nations of Europe\nBy RICHARD HEATH DABNEY\nProfessor of History, University of Virginia.\nSpain\nT\nHE situation in Morocco has grown \nsteadily worse, as Primo de Rivera \nhimself has been obliged to admit. \nThe Moorish tribes are playing the \nsame game which the Spaniards them\xad\nselves played against the French armies \nin the days of Napoleon..For Morocco, \nlike Spain, is largely mountainous and \nrough, making regular operations by \nlarge armies extremely difficult. As \nthe Spanish guerrillas swooped down \nfrom their mountain fastnesses upon \nsmall bodies of Frenchmen, captured \nor destroyed wagon trains of munitions \nand food, cut communications and sur\xad\nrounded garrisons, so the Moorish \nguerrillas are now handling the Span\xad\niards. They have got possession, more\xad\nover, o f modem weapons of warfare, \nand have learned something of modem \nstrategy. Aided by the broken charac\xad\nter of the terrain, they are able, in \nspite of the Spanish airmen, to concen\xad\ntrate their attacks, first upon the east, \nand then upon tbe west flank of the \nextended Spanish line. The Govern\xad\nment is continually announcing that all \nwill be well in the end. But meantime \nSpanish money and Spanish blood are \nbeing squandered in profusion. Accord\xad\ning to a special cable from Tetuan to \nThe New York Times on Sept. 5,\nSpain has 100,000 troops in the western \npart of the Spanish zone, half of which \nare in the Tetuan sector alone; how \nmany there are in the eastern part is \nnot stated. Reuter’s Gibraltar corre\xad\nspondent said on Sept. 2 that 50,000 \nreinforcements had been sent to Mo\xad\nrocco during the preceding fortnight. \nThe newly arrived troops, though \ncourageous, are said to be poor marks\xad\nmen, insufficiently trained and under \ninexperienced officers. The losses in \nkilled and wounded are believed to he \nfar heavier than officially announced. \nThough the Moors could hardly hope \nto capture Tetuan, a battle, in which \ntroops from the garrison participated, \nwas fought on Sept. 1 within a mile or \ntwo of its walls. The Moors were said \nto have occupied posts o f which no re\xad\nport had been made, and also to have \ncaptured artillery and quantities of \nrifles, ammunition and stores. So alarm\xad\ning was the situation that Primo de \nRivera went to Morocco on Sept. 5 and \ntook personal charge o f the military \noperations. The next day he telegraphed \nhack that the situation in the western \nzone was somewhat easier.\nIs it strange that a Spaniard should \nhave said to F. Jean-Desthieux (who \nrecords the statement in Le Courrier \nCatalan of Aug. 15), “ We expect from \nAbd-el Krim the salvation of Spain” ?\n', "138 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE Oct., 1924\n“ Every' one,”  says Jean-D’esthieux, “ who \nis not a militarist, in Castile as well as \nin other parts of Spain (not to speak \nof Catalonia!) recognizes the vanity of \nthis expedition.”  He quotes H. G. Wells \nas denouncing this senseless war against \nthe Moors, and as also denouncing \nTlivera for suppressing public opinion.\nIn Catalonia, at least, public opinion \nis very much alive. At the funeral of \nthe great poet Guimera (who refused \nthe title of nobility offered him by the \nDictator) about 50,000 people filled \nthe streets of Barcelona for several \nhours. Government officials, both civil \nand military, were conspicuous by their \nabsence.\nAt Santander, oh Aug. 12, King A l\xad\nfonso entertained a representative of \nThe New York Times at luncheon, along \nwith Ambassador Moore and Primo de \nRivera, and flatly denied any intention \neither to remove Rivera or to do away \npermanently with Parliament. He said \nRivera would need at least another year, \nhowever, to prepare for the revival of \nParliamentary Government. ;\nThe Spanish Government has author\xad\nized a contract with the Compania Tele\xad\nfonica Nacional de Espana (organized \nby the International Telephone and \nTelegraph Corporation of New York in \ncooperation with Spanish banks) for \nthe construction and operation of a gen\xad\neral telephone system which will take \nover and consolidate the existing Gov\xad\nernment-owned system with the private \ntelephone systems of Spain. Under the \nnew railway law recently passed it is ex\xad\npected that over 8,000 miles of line \ncosting 4,868 million pesetas will be \nconstructed in twenty years. Spain and \nGermany have recently made a new \ncommercial agreement which is expected \nto help Germany’s export trade to Spain \nin competition with that of the United \nStates.\nA  group of Americans have recently \nreturned from Spain, where they par\xad\nticipated in the honors done to the mem\xad\nory of Adelantado Don Pedro Menendez \nat his birthplace Aviles. Recent re\xad\nsearch indicates that he was the founder \nof St. Augustine, Fla.\nPortugal\n(Y N  the night of Aug. 11 an attempted \n^  rising of Radical-Communists in \nthe outskirts of Lisbon was easily sup\xad\npressed; the leaders fled. On Aug. 18 \ntwo policemen were seriously injured by \na bomb. At dawn on Aug. 19 another \nbomb exploded in the city, destroying \ntwo shops and damaging others. On \nthe night of Aug. 28 the Castle of St. \nGeorge, the Lisbon citadel, was at\xad\ntacked; but the garrison, in spite of the \ntreason of a number of sergeants, re\xad\npulsed the attack and took thirteen pris\xad\noners.\nThe Portuguese Parliament adjourned \non Aug. 21, after passing a vote of con\xad\nfidence in the Ministry by 42 votes to, \n20. A  Reuter telegram from Lisbon \nsays that the pay of Portuguese civil \nservants, soldiers and members of Par\xad\nliament is to be increased.\nSwitzerland\nr PHE police of Schaffhauseri on Aug.\n5 dispersed with drawn swords a \nmob of Communists who had attempted \nto storm the police station and rescue \ntwo of their comrades. On Aug. 11, \nIlberg, a French Communist, and \nThomas, a German Communist, were ar\xad\nrested in Zurich for circulating propa\xad\nganda and were deported about a week \nlater.\nAccording to a dispatch to the Euro\xad\npean Commercial o f Vienna, high wage3 \nand freight rates, with the increased \ncost of living, have caused a number of \nindustries to leave Switzerland during \nthe last few years. The watch industry, \nhowever, with the aid of State sub\xad\nsidies, has largely recovered, particu\xad\nlarly in Solothurn, where the fifty-two- \nhour week has been introduced. In \nNeuchatel, where the hours of labor \nwere not increased, there remained some \nthousands of unemployed.\nThe Marconi Radio Station Company \nof Berne announced that in 1923 it had \ndispatched 147,032 telegrams and re\xad\nceived 68,283. The share capital had \nbeen increased by 2,100,000 francs, of \nwhich the Government holds 1,100,000-\n", "Oct., 1924 A MONTH’S WORLD HISTORY 139\nA portrait of Admiral Semmes, Com\xad\nmander of the Alabama, has been pre\xad\nsented by the United Daughters of the \nConfederacy to the City of Geneva, \nwhere the Alabama question was settled.\nHolland\n'T ' HE liquor treaty between the United \nStates and Holland was signed by \nSecretary Hughes and Jc-nkheer de \nGraeff, Dutch Minister to the United \nStates, on Aug. 21.\nThe Dutch Government has awarded \n600 florins to the crew of the trawler \nLord Allenby of Lowestoft for the ser\xad\nvices rendered in rescuing members of \nthe crew of the Scheveningen trawler \nHubertha Cornelia last October.\nDenmark\nA BILL for the abolition o f . the \nDanish Army and the substitution \nof. a reserve police force for the na\xad\ntional militia has been prepared by \nthe Minister of Defense, and, with the \napproval of the Socialist Cabinet, will \nbe presented to Parliament this Autumn. \nThe bill also provides for the reduction \nof the navy almost to the vanishing \npoint, but retains the air force,' which \nwill probably be enlarged.\nThe announcement of this proposed \nbill has had a wide repercussion in Swe\xad\nden, where the Conservative Govern\xad\nment, headed by Ernst Trygger, is com\xad\nmitted to a large military budget for \nnational defense. Herr Trygger’s public \ncomment on the Danish proposals, im\xad\nplying that Danish disarmament would \nhave a very unfavorable effect on Swe\xad\nden’s political and military situation, \nwas answered with some sharpness by \nthe Danish radical press, which bluntly- \nwarned the Swedish Government not to \ninterfere in Denmark's domestic af\xad\nfairs, and Herr Rasmussen, .Danish Min\xad\nister for National Defense, retorted that \nit was better for a nation to acknowl\xad\nedge frankly its military impotence than \nto seek to solve problems beyond its \nstrength. The point of view of the So\xad\ncialist Government of Denmark is based \non the new political tendencies crystal\xad\nlized in the League of Nations and on \nthe hope that the peace of Europe must \nbe maintained by international under\xad\nstanding rather than by physical force.\nThe international Boy Scout “ jam\xad\nboree”  ended on Aug. 17 with a parade \nof 6,000 Scouts at Copenhagen. The \nAmerican boys made a fine impression \non Aug. 12 by their Indian dances under \nthe leadership of William Hubert, de\xad\nscendant of a Mohawk Chief. The Har- \nmonian Singing Society of Chicago has \nalso favorably impressed the Danes by \ntheir singing of American songs. They \nwere given a farewell dinner on Aug. \n17 at the Royal Yacht Club.\nA dispatch to Copenhagen from Cap\xad\ntain Knud Rasmussen, who .lately \nreached Kotzebue, Alaska, after a three- \nyear sojourn in Arctic regions, an\xad\nnounced great results from the expedi\xad\ntion. A connection had undoubtedly \nbeen discovered between the Green\xad\nlanders and the Eskimos of Central and \nWestern North America; valuable infor\xad\nmation had been gained concerning \ntheir religious ceremonies, and a great \ncollection had been made o f tools, weap\xad\nons and costumes.\nA Danish radio company has con\xad\ntracted to build a number of stations \non the west coast o f Greenland, and one \nof them will be in operation within a \nfew months.\nThe total trade of the United States \nwith Greenland now totals nearly \n$250,000 a year, and consists chiefly \nof the mineral cryolite which is mined \nby an American company and shipped \nmainly to Philadelphia.\nThe Town of Villers-Franqueux in \nthe devastated part of France has re\xad\nceived 210,000 francs from the Danish \nSociety for the Relief of the Regions \nDevastated by the War.\nNorway\nA CCORDING to Lloyd’s Register, \nNorway has 750 tons of shipping \nper thousand inhabitants, while England \nhas only 350 and the United States 125. \nNorway lost during the war 49.3 per \ncent, of her total tonnage, hut her peo-\n", "140 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE Oct., 1924\nGilliams\nDR.

Both \nleaders are cool-headed, experienced \nstatesmen, and their views are perfectly \nclear. Though Trygger admits that mu\xad\ntual international confidence is the only \npermanent guarantee for peace, he insists \nthat in the present chaotic state of Eu\xad\nrope Sweden must be thoroughly armed\nin self-defense. Branting, however, de\xad\nclares for the immediate cutting down \nof the military budget by 40,000,000 \nkroner. If a nation wishes peace, he \nsays, it must prepare for peace and not \nfor war. He also denounces the “ un\xad\nholy alliance”  of the capitalists under \nTrygger’s leadership and demands a se\xad\ncure home and a strip of Swedish soil \nfor every Swede who wants it. Trygger, \nhowever, says that no alliance could be \nmore unholy than that between the \nSocial-Democrats and the Red Commun\xad\nists who take their orders from Moscow, \nand demands internal peace and na\xad\ntional economy, basing Sweden’s future \non the old foundations. The elections \nwill take place on Sept. 21.\nSven Luebeck, Swedish Minister of \nCommunication, has recently published \nan estimate that Sweden has invested \nabout $268,000,000' in harnessing her \nwater power; about 21 per cent, o f her \navailable “ white coal”  being already \ncommercially utilized. Herr Luebeck de\xad\nclares that in both quantity and quality \nelectrification of water-power in Sweden \nexcels that of nearly every other coun\xad\ntry. For example, 40 per cent, o f the \nSwedish farms run their machinery by \nelectricity and 50 per cent, of the coun\xad\ntry houses have electric lights.\nDuring the first five months of 1924\n240,000 metric tons o f ground and sul\xad\nphite wood pulp have been shipped \nfrom Sweden, an increase o f 50 per cent, \nover the same period last year. The \nexports of newsprint amounted to 56,- \n000 metric tons, an increase of 28 per \ncent. Other paper exports increased \n24 per cent. The Svea Steamship Line \nhas recently purchased three vessels to \nstart a freight route to North America.\nOn Aug. 19 regular nightly air mail \nservice began between Stockholm and \nBerlin. In August an ambulance air\xad\nplane designed in Sweden for the Red \nCross carried an ill woman witE a \ntrained nurse 150 miles over the wild \ncountry near the Arctic Circle.
