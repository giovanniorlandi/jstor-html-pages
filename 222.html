Lockwood, director of, the university extension work of the, University of Arizona, will visit No, gales Monday and Tuesday, Novem, ber 3 and 4, to acquaint the people, of the Line City with the new depart, m\'ent recently organized at the high, est educational institution of Arizo, na’s complete and excellent system., He will deliver addresses both even, ings at the Santa Cruz Club., The principal address will be Mon, day evening, the topic treated will be, “Education and Democracy.”, Tuesday evening the address will be, “Paris, France, and the Peace Con, ference.”, When the United States entered the, world war, Doctor Lockwood obtained, leave of absence from the university, and was an instructor in the trans, port service between America and, Europe. After the armistice was, signed he spent several months in, France., During his two days’ stay in No, gales Doctor Lockwood wishes to meet, and become acquainted with the war, committees that served during the, war, community leaders and leaders, of women’s clubs., Everbody is invited to hear the ad, dresses of Doctor Lockwood Monday, and Tuesday evenings at ’the Santa, Cruz Club., A NEW BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, Yesterday arrangements were con, cluded whereby the business of the, Cactus Candy Company of Nogales, will be reorganized dnder the name of, the Mirona Cactus Candy Company., Outside parties being interested sub, stantially with local business men., The company proposes to specialize, in the production of cactus candy,, keeeping up the high standard of the, product as manufactured by the orig, inal Cactus Candy Company., The capacity of-the plant that the, new concern anticipates install ing .will, be in the neighborhood of one thou, sand pounds of cactus candy daily., The food and needlework sale an, nounced by the ladies of the Congre, gational Church as taking place to, day has been postponed to a later, date, to be announced at another time., The Halloween dance at the Santa, Cruz Club yesterday evening was at, tended by a large concourse of No, gales society folk, and it was a most, enjoyable function., UNITEDiMINE WORKERS, WILL NOT RECEDE, AND, SAY MEN WOULD QUIT, WORK AT MIDNIGHT, ANTI-STRIKE INJUNCTION GRANTED BY ITNI, TED STATES COURT AT INDIANAPOLIS- IT, FORBIDS PAYING STRIKE BENEFITS ALSO, FOREST DESERVE, REFUSES LEASE, RENEWALS FOR, GRAZINGJERMITS, Cattlemen Ordered to Move, Their Cattle, at This Time, Working a Hardship., “The Oasis” is informed that For, est Reeserve officials are refusing ex, tenticn of expiring leases of cattle, men grazing in the national forests,, and notifying them to remove their, cattle on or before date of expiration, which in some cases is November 30., To compel removal at this time, when, cattlemen generally are engaged in, the roundup, is a matter of consider, able hardship, for they haveto go to, looking for pasturage when they, should be following the chuck wagon., Then, beyond that, why should cat, tle be removed from the forests at, all ? The notices sent recite that the, order issues because of the abundant, rains there is plenty of feed, and that, thereis no reason why they should, continue to graze on the forests. But,, is there any reason why they should, not? The very rains that have made, feed so good elsewhere have made it, good also in the forests; and why, should that not be fed to cattle, con, serving the abundance on grazing, lands outside. With a lot of cattle, feeding on the forests the fine feed, outside will last longer and outside, ranges will not become scant and so, soon overstocked when dry seasons, come around., Then in these hard times and heavy, taxation, is not the revenue that cat, tle on the forests take into the feder, al treasury an item of importance to, Uncle Sam? One would think so., Not long ago “The Oasis” published, a statement that the forest service, had paid into the state treasury of, Arizona the handsome sum of $176,-, 000, being 20 per cent of grazing, fees on the forests, that goes to the, schools and roads of the state. Then, if the state got that handsome sum of, money from one-fifth of the grazing, fees, the federal government received., $700,000. One would think that an, item worth while. And when all the, forest reserve states are taken mto, consideration it must run into millions, And why should the states be depriv, ed of the handsome sums that they re, alize from that source?, When one surveys the crassness of, some federal officials it is with a feel, ing of amazement that such f r \'lk, make ou- to get along at all. Every, litle wh le there crops up something, ol‘ the kind. They seem to exercise, their ingenuity in trying to do ridic, vlous inings. This is a as good a, place as any to relate a persona! ex, perienre., About thirty years ago “The Oasis” j, editor was informed that the United, States owed his deceased father, wh.* \', was an officer in the Civil Wm, a, sum A money expended in the line, >f and never repaid; which, would be paid to the heirs upon prop, er application. So application was, duly r-\'t-de on behalf of four living, children—father and mother both, dead. In the showing there was one, of the heirs deceased, who died m, 1864, at eight years of age. Well,, that claim dragged along for live, years. From time to time, sen-wua, A Region Teeming With, Possibilities, THE WEST COAST, —OF—, MEXICO, Six Pages—No. 282, (United Press Service), INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., October 31., —Today Federal Judge Anderson, granted the United States government, a temporary injunction restraining, 1 officials of the United Mine Workers, of America from ordering the coal, strike, or poying strike benefits from, union funds., I After a conference with the execu, j tive board of the United Mine Work, ers, Acting President Lewis announc, ed that the strike would become ef, fective at midnight, in defiance of the, restraining order issued out from the, 1 federal court., Assistant Attorney General Ames,, who arrived from Washington this, morning and represented the govern, ment before the federal court in the, application for an injunction, declar, ed that if the strike is effective rail, roads cannot get coal and their ser, vice would fall of right away, work, ing reduction of operating revenues,, which would result in large inroads, in public funds. It would be impossi, ble to carry mail, commerce, transpor, tation and army units would be para, lyzed, and there will be widespread, suffering., The court granted the temporary, injunction on the basis of the Lever, food control act, under provision of, which the government took control of, the railways., Yesterday evening Mrs. C. H. Hop, kins, one of the prominent members, of the American colony at Guvma*., arrived by the train from th* south!, Mr. Hopkins conducts a photograph, gallery in the Sonora metropolis., In the department handling the claim, thought up something that cause.! a, demand lor an affidavit or two Then,, when everything else had been, thought up, and affidavits exacted,, there came a demand for an affidavit, from two distinterested parties who, knew the deceeased heiress, to swear, that she died without issue. She was, only eight years of age when she, died and that was thirty years before,, while the place where she was bur, ied had seen none of her immediate, family in over twenty years. It was, one of the most ridiculous things that, ever happened., The writer took up his pen and dip, ped it in “Worm and gall wood,” to, borrow a transposition we heard once,, and wrote the department a letter that, in “Worm and gallwood,” to borrow, a transposition we heard once, and, wrote the department a letter that, would have singed the hair of a cast, iron dog. In all the half century of, writing perpetrated by “The Oasis”, man there was never before anything, 1 like it—and but once since; the latter, occasion will be recalled readily as, having precipitated a celebrated ‘mass, meeting’ in which the skinned party, was given a poultice of resolutions, which turned out more smarting than, healing., Well, Hon. Oakes Murphy, who was, the delegate in Congress from Arizo, na at that time, happened in the war, department office the day the letter, j described was received, and it had, i made the fool writer a butt of the en, tire office. Oakes wrote the editor, that it “was sure some letter.”, The claim was alowed at once; and, we all got the money that covered it., And it seems now that the perpe- », trator of this order pushing cattle off, the national forests when the feed is, better than in many years before,, must be the same man who wanted, an affidavit that an eight-year-eld, child who had been dead for thirty, years, had “died without issue.”]', '[PAGE TWO, CALIFORNIA, BELLEFLEUR APPLES, Your Dealer Will Supply You, First Carload of the Season Just Received, Buxton-Smith Co., Wholesale Distributors, Office 349 Morley Avenue.

Chappell are, drawing large congregations, and all, \'who hear the talented exhorter come, away from the service with food for, thought and substance for boliefo. All, in touch with the work feel that the, stay of Mr. Chappell in Nogales will, result in great good., Thursday evening the theme of Mr, Chappell was “The Sufficiency of Di, vine Grace to Save the Greatest Sin, ner.”, The message of the evangelist was, based upon the story o r Zaccheus, the, chief of the publicans, in whose home, Christ was an honored guest. He, “went about doing good” and “seek, ing to save that which is lost,” is anx, ious to be a guest in every home,, and he is able “to save to the utter, most everyone who wall come to Gc, by Him.”, The subject treated yesterday ev, ening. “A Good Man Lost,” was bas, ed upon the story of the rich young, man who came running to Jesus but, went sadly away; and it was told with, a wealth of illustration and a pointed, application that sent home the truths, uttered to the hearts of all hearers., This evening (Saturday) the mes, sage will be a consideration of Divine, grace and in dealing with sinners., The subject, “Three Ways of Dealing, JVith Wrongdoers”—that of the mob,, that of the law\' and that of the Holy, God., The Sunday morning subject, “How, to Be Rich,” 1 is one in which most all, classes are interested., Sunday evening the theme will be, “No Ropm for Jesus.” At this tifne, Mr. Chappell will give his own expedi, ence—how a great sinner, lawyer and, politician was made a new creature., Many have been helpeed greatly and, encouraged by the practictal lessons, brought by the evangelist in his great, sermons., Friday evening there arrived at, Nogales Rev.

What will be the outcome?, The intolerable condition cannot last long., In dealing with the problems that had led up to., and been solved by the Civil War, James Russel Low, ell, in 1865, wrote:, “The masses of any people, however intelligent,, are very little moved by abstract principles of hu-j, manity and justice, until those principles are inter- 1, preted for them by some stinging commentary of, some infringement upon their own rights; and then, their instincts and passions, once aroused do indeed, derive an incalculable impulse and intensity from, those higher ideals, those sublime traditions, which, have no motive political force until they are allied, with a sense of personal urgency.” I, The paragraph quoted described the very posi, tion into which the arrogance of the slave power, drove the people of the United States in 1861. It, describes now the position into which the arrogance, of Capital and the arrogance of Labor are fast driv, ing, the people of the same United States in this year, of our Lord, 1919. In 1861 the slave power had a, risen to that height of arrogance and iniquity that, it vainly imagined itself greater and more powerful, than the general government the people of the, entire United States. For long months the people, of. America, as represented in their chosen rulers,, temporized with the cruel and iniquitous power, that trafficked in human flesh, and rolled in the, wealth procured by the tortured effort of unrequit, ed labor. Then the American people arose in their, wrath and their might: and proceeded to do straight, away divers and sundry things to the slave power. |, Now, that part of the Capital in the United States, which is interested in caol mines; and that part of, the Labor of the country employed in making those, mines productive, are in a deadlock where they are, putting upon the people at large a long train of evils,, and an incalculable amount of hardship and suffer, ing)., Probably each side of the controversy has with, it some degree of right; but the point of it is that, they are paying no heed to the rights of others., They are putting the masses of the people into that, situation described by the essayist quoted where the, abstract principles of humanity and justice “are in, terpreted for them by some stinging commentary of, some infringement upon their own rights;” and, when so interpreted the mass of the people will arise, in their wrath, putting the two houses quarreling, into their just and proper places, just as their fathers, did with the slave power., At this writing “The Oasis” will not pretend to, state what will be done in the present crisis, nor how, it will be done; but it does predict that something will, be done, just as something was done to the slave pow, er; and when done all will agree that it was done, iustly and correctly., Let the contending powers recollect that “the, voice of the people is the voice of God;’’ and that in (, flying in the faces of the people they are invoking, the judgment of the Almighty; and, that “the judg, . ments of God are just and altogether righteous.”, m §d m, It’s easy for the hardened sinner to put on a, frock coat, a plug hat, a black tie, and pass muster in, a crowd of respectable people.

MAXEY, OUR MIGHTIEST HOT SPRING., ALMOST In the center of Wyoming,, near a bend in the Big Horn river, and 4,350 feet above sea level, nature, brought to the surface, for the bene, fit of ai! humanity, her most notable, work in the hot-spring line. Here, from, a rough-edged opening approximately, 25 feet in diameter, and which may, come through from China for all any, body knows —since It has been sound, ed to a depth of 1,000 feet and no bot, tom found, there bubbles forth about, 18,000,000 gallons of 135-degree hot, water, possessing untold medicinal, value, every 24 hours., This health fount was discovered, by a wandering band of Indians. When, the white man came he named it “Big, Horn Hot Spring,” because the water, was finally tumbled over a 40-foot cliff, in a beautiful waterfall to the river, below. A city was built by the river., They called it Thermopolls .(Hot City),, because of Its nearness to the spring., The government purchased the tract, on which the spring Is located in 1887., Washakie, chief of the Shoshone,, agreed only on condition that a por, tion of the water be reserved forever, free for public use. Later, when the, government ceded the land to the stute,, the same clause was inserted in the, patent. Thus this great nature-made, anti-toxin for many Ills which beset, humanity has been preserved for the, use of everybody for all time.
