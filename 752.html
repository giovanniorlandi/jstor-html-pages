The court broad-\n\' ly affirms the right of every State- to\nprotect the marriage tie of ts own\ncitizens against dissolution by another\nState on residence taken up solely for\nthat .purpose. This was done in the\ncase of a Dakota divorce-which had\nbeen declared invalid by the Supreme\nCourt of Massachusetts and subsequ\nently in the case of a divorce obtain\ned in Oklahoma. To realize the far\nreaching importance of this ruling by\nthe highest court of the nation it -is\nonly necessary to call to mind what\nhas been for years a common practice\nof applicants going to Dakota, for ex\nample, for the mere purpose of get\nting a divorce after the required re\nsidence of six months and then return\ning to their ovm States to live. Such\ndecrees have been generally supposed\nand often held by the courts, to be\nlegal.\n.

The Popes, who\nchoose any title by \' which they may\n- wish to be known, do so either out of\ndevotion to one of the saints, whose\nname they assume, or out of reverence\nto one of their \'predecessors.\nDuring,! the nineteenth\' .century\nthere,-were four Popes called Pius,\nending with Pius IX. Of the remaining\nthree Popes of that century, two were\nknown as leo. ; \' w\nNo special importance" can be at\ntached to the , meaning of the word\n"Plus." It is of classical origin, and\nprobably is rendered pretty nearly by\n"The Good." .That it has .been\' chosen\nby recent Popes is owing to the fair\nmemory of the fifth Pius, a Saint of\nthe sixteenth century.\n- Pope Leo XIII chose the name\n"Leo" PrUy because Pope.

This stream has the\nbest volume of water, the best fall\nand the best chance to harness power\nof any stream that flows through the\nState, and in spite of this fact, only\none small mill is utilizing\' the"\' im\nmense stream that-Is flowing through\nthe steep canyons.\nThe Carson rever ts without doubt\nthe beSSwIng iW in (Ws State.\nThe. ..source comes Vxromlthe largest\nwater shed of aSt of Jae Vrivers and\nthaj supply Is from so" many sources\ntha it never fails at the head water.\nWle cay . stjns aje, XaingTie\nly divided among the farmers its en-\ntir length, there would-be., no water\nshortage.

Above the ranch line in Alpine\ncountythe-source-of the river \'there\nis the best chance to harness , the\nstream or any that can be offered men\nwho are locking for power. The\nstream flows through narrow canyons\nformile3 and the grade is sufficient\nto develop many ; thousands of horse\npower for every mile. Above the farm\ners there is a flow of ; water that is\nnever diminished to any great ex\ntent, and the wonder is that the par\nities who have been looking for pow\ner\' have not taken advantage of the\nCarson river.\nNot only does the East Fork pre\nsent this power to the first man who\ncares for it, but the West Fork of the\nriver is just as advantageous. From\nthe land of Charity valley, to the\nranchers who take the stream from its\nbed, there is a world of power going\ndov n one of the steepest canyons that\ncan be found.
