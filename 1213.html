Oct. 2.\nThe object of the government iu or\ndering all persons Iu the Primoria\nto register iu the church communi\nties to which they belong or leave\nthe country was to establish a gov\nernment ot priests and parish com\nmunities. All civil authority will be\nhanded over to the church communi\nty of each district, which will appoint\nIts own executive council. Members\nof the church community who do\nnot attend the meetings of their\nchurch are liable to fines amounting\nto 25 roubles gold and to expulsion\nThe decision of the executive coun\ncil of mother church Is subject to\nthe approval of the governor of the\ndistrict.\nThis project has aroused the de\nrision of the public and the priest is\nhailed as the "civil governor." Up\nto the present the one means of\nself-expression left to the peasant\nand the villagers is through thei?\nZemstvOB. These Institutions were\nsemiofficial in the reign of the\nCiar and although some of the mem\nbers of the Zemstvos were elected\nby the vote of the peasants the or\nganization in Itself was an official\none.\nAfter the revolution the Zemstvos\nbecame a purely political machine\nconsisting largely of social revolu\ntionists. They were a formidable\nenemy during the dictatorship of\nAdmiral Kolchat. In order to do\naway with this evil the present dic\ntator has evolved this plan of local\nself government. It is the first time\nIn the history of the district that\nthe peasant really has had the right\not self-expression.\nRELEASED FROM JAIL\nClaus Martens and William Norke,\nalleged syndicalists, who have been\nhe\'.d In the couu\'y Jail in default\nof bonds, were released yesterday\nby Judge Averill upon their own\nThe defendants had\nI been Indicted by the grand Jury as\nI . it nf Invoatleatlons concerning\ntheir activities.\nESSAY CONTEST STARTS\nCHICAGO, Oct. 25.

Business men\nhave prepared for the occasion and\nearly this afternoon conditions gen\nerally were quite lively. Now that\nthe labor difficulties that have been\nhovering over the community have\nbeen amicably adjusted, the men\nemployed in the two districts will\nfeel more free to purchase needed\nnecessities, and the business life\nshould vapidly adjust itself, which\nwill ultimately result in Tonopah be\ncoming the most prosperous milling\ncamp in the west.\nREESE RIVER STILL\nREMEMBERS RALLY\nItKESK RIVER, Nevada, Oct 21.\'\n(Special to the Bonanza) This\nthriving community is still spell\nbound as a result of the whirlwind j\nrally held at our Dutch Flat school:\ni\nhouse for the republican county can-:\ndidates on Saturday night.. The\nsentiment freely expressed by the\nresidents of the valley and the camps!\ncontiguous thereto Is to the effect j\nthat the extraordinary pep by which\nthe meeting was characterized was\nlargely due to tlie presence of W.\nW. Booth, editor of the Tonopah\nDaily Bonanza, who is a warm pen\nsonal friend of most of the oldest j\nfamilies in these parts. "BUI," as\nwe affectionately allude to him, ar-l\nrived at the meeting place with a\nparticularly charming bevy of young\nschoolma\'ams from Tonopah, for\nwhich he earned the hearty grati\ntude of ail the cattle barons and\nbashful cowpuiichers present. "Bill"\ncirculated anion.; the bunch seeing\nthat everybody was propertly and\nfrequently introduced, and hhiisolf\ncarried off the honors in many a fox\ntrot wherein he proved himself an\nadept at shaking a wicked hip.\nUnprecedented enthusiasm was in\njected into the dancing, rollicking\nmob by the frequent singing ot the\nnow-famous war song of the stal\n"Has anybody here seen Johnny,\nJohnny,\nJ.

In other words the\ntopworkers and craftsmen are satis\nfied with conditions as they now\nexist and have no objection to the\nunderground workers receiving what\nmight be "erined a bonus of 25 cents\na day over that of those who work\non top of the ground.\nThe meeting last night was har\nmonious to a marked degree and fol\nlowing the report of the committee\nthat was named to meet with the\nmine operators, a vote of thanks was\nextended to the members and an\nadjournment sine die was ordered.\nR. H. Thomas presided and briefly\nexplained the situation as it existed,\nand it was through his efforts that\nharmony was maintained and an\nadjustment of the existing contro\nversies brought to a happy con\nclusion. The Tonopah and Divide districts\nare now ready for a season of great\nactivity which will naturally be fol\nlowed by an era of prosperity. The\nunderground workers have signed\nup at the present wage scale for\nthe period during which silver shall\nremain at $1 an ounce. Tho oper\nators have agreed that the wage,\nscale agreed upon shall prevail dur\ning that period, and It is agreed by\nboth sides that there shall neither\nbe a decrease or an Increase dur\ning that period.\nThe Tonopah and Divide districts\nnow pay the highest wage scale of\nany mining sections in the wes\', and\nas a natural consequence w will\nsoon be homing the most skilled\nlabor In the country. Miners from\noutside camps with true American\ninstincts are already making Tono\npah their destination, and gradually\nwill the undesirable foreign element\nbe eliminated. The operators will\nnaturally benefit as a result In the\nchange of employment conditions,\nwhich will be followed by greater\nefficiency and Increased production.\nMRS. H. H.

True, but he did all in his power to keep the\nduty on Nevada\'s products as low as possible.\nThey\'ll ttll ycu he voted for a tariff on Nevada\'s products when the present tariff act was being\nconsidered. Let\'s examine the record and see if he did\nPittman\'s Record On\nPresent Tariff Act\nPittman\'s voting record in i\' resent tariff bill shows that he stood invariably for\nfree trade. He either voted against or was pairei aga;rst all committee amendments increasing the tariff. It\nis true that he voted in favor of the tariff on a few N-;vda products, namely on beef. veai. and larfibs. but\nhe failed to vr\'.f \':r p.ct.ctve duties on cattle, wool, livestock products , and hides.\nHe voted for fret cyanide, falling in line with Senator Oddie. but he was an obstructionist to Sen\nator Oddie\'s efforts because of his vicious attacks on the motive of the senate finance committee.\nNOT CONTENT WITH VOTING AGAINST OR PAIRING HIMSELF AGAINST PRACTICALLY ALL THE\nITEYS CONTAINED IN THE TARIFF BILL. SENATOR PITTMAN THEN NULLIFIED HIS OWN ACT IN VOTING\nFOR DUilES ON SOME NEVADA FRODUCTS BY "PAIRING HIMSELF" AGAIN?T THE BILL ON FINAL PAS\nSAGE.. AND THAT\'S THE KIND OF A PROTECTIONIST SENATOR PiHMN IS FOR NEVADA INDUS\nTRIES AND PROrtUf-IS.\nNow how do you think he\'ll vote on the tariff oi.ould the Democrats regain control of Congress. Do\nyou think he\'ll vote against his party platform and stand for a protective tariff on Nevada products," or do\nyou think he\'ll vote as he has in the\' past, tor "free trade" all along the line.\nDo yuu think you can afford to return to the United States Senate a man whoT voted for the most\nruinous tariff act since the days of Grover Cleveland. You remember and know that the Underwood tariff\nbill was responsible for an industrial crisis that had no parallel in American history except those produced\nin the last preceding Democratic administration when Covey\'s army marched to the White House.\nBut Mr. Pittman voted for it and branded it with his stamp of approval.\nYou know that under the Underwood bill a quirter of a million railroad employes were laid off. The\nnation was brought to the verge of ruin by the Wilson measures. Between four and five million workmen\nwere out of a jjob at the end of the Wilson administration.\nDo you want to bring back those conditions. !f you do vote for Pittman. He\'ll help bring them back\nif the Democrats ever get in power again and he is in the senate.\nPittman Opposed the\nRevenue Act\nk \' iS SonnennJlCnni,i,,TLe !hat\'1the r.evenue passcd b ,he Republican Conqress reduced public\ntaxes by over i800.000.000 The big ,tem in reduction was brought by an inercased exemption tor heads\nof families and by increasing the deduction allowed for minor dependents.
