Davidson of Chicago, who\nhas accomplished extensive develop\nment in the Raymondville section of\nCameron county, returned last night\nfrom a short visit to the Santena\nI property. He was accompanied by\nDr. Geo. Ellingsworth of Chicago .who\ncame down last week with MrvDa\ni vidson, on the latter\'s private car.\n! The exact nature of Mr. Davidson\'s\n, object in making this visit he does\nnot detail, but it is not to he supposed\nthat he made it merely for pleasure,\nnor was it for the benefit of his health.\nHis trip extended as far as Soldadito,\n\' one of the large ranches on the San\ntena tract, which is about 100-miles\nsouth of Colombres, and inspected the\nwprk that has been accomplished on\nthis great development project so far.\ni "You have no idea of the real mag\nnitude of this work, unless you make\na personal inspection of it,"- Mr. Da\nvidson said this morning. "The com.\npany has already constructed several\nimmense concrete reservoirs in the\ntract, which are furnishing water for\nthe irrigating canals in the Soldadito\nsection. The great agricultural possi\nbilities of the country are already be\nginning to manifest themselves at\nSoldadito. I saw immense fields of\ncorn of the most luxuriant growth,\nfrom which fully one hundred bushels\nper acre will be harvested. The plant\ners are adopting modern agricultural\nmethods and the results are already\nbecoming apparent."\nAccompanying Mr. Davidson from\nColombres, were three Mexican gen\ntlemen who are connected with the\nSantena company, Messrs. Inigo Gar\ncia, Delfin Sanchez Juarez who, by\nthe way is a grand-nephew of the\ngreat President Juarez of Mexico\nand Andres Horcasitas, all of Mexico\nCity, Mir. Horcasitas headquarters\nare now at Colimbres. He is in close\ntouch with the Santena company,\nand is looking after its interests in\nthe field.\nThe report has been current at\nBrownsville recently that the great\nproperty Known as the Santena tract\nhas been sold to B. P. Yoakum and\nhis associates of the Rock Islarid\nFrisco sys\'em. but neither Mr. Da\nvidson nor any of his party would\nadmit it. On the contrary, while\nnone are exactly, willing to be quoted\nas saying so, yet the reported sale Is\nvirtually, denied b\'y them. Mr. David\nson states that the development of\nthis great project will be pushed by\nthe active and intelligent Mexican\ncapitalists owning it. chief of whom\nare the Noriega Bothers of Mexico.\nA railway 100 miles long, to co-operate\nin the development of the tract\nwhich embraces a .principality in\nland, 2,000,000 acres being included\nwithin its bounds will be built by\nthe company, within the near future,\nso Mr. Horcasitas states. .\nWILL ENLARGE COUItT HOUSE\nCounty Commissioners\' Court Autho\nrizes $1,4 Op Addition.\nThe county commissioners court\nmet in regular session \'this morning\nwith County Judge John Bartlett, E.\nB.

K. .Hallam appeared before\nthe council, in behalf of the residents\nin the northern portion of the city,\nstating that he Tiad three matters to\nwhicfi\'he wished to call the attention\nof the council. The first was that the\ncitizens residing in the northern part\nof the city were greatly annoyed by\nthe cattle burros and stock- now\nroaming at large, which, by reaching\nover fences eat a great many plants\nand destroy young trees, besides be\ning a geperal nuisance; second, that\nfor the past fcw weeks the citizens In\nthat locality have been much annoyed\nand probably their lives endangered by\nthe prc-Tiiscuous shooting of Are arms\nat night, which has occurred innum\nerable times of late,, it being request\ned that a policeman be placed on duty\nin that locality; third, that in rainy\nweather it was impossible for the\npeople residing in .hat locality to get\nto town without getting extremely\nmuddy, on account of there being no\nsidewalks. He requested the city to\ntake some action in regard to the\nstock law. a sidewalk ordinance and\nplacing an officer on duty in the\nnorthern end of the city at night.\nMayor- Comlfe stated that the city\nattorney has already been instructed\nto draw up a stock ordinance and that\nfor some time past the council had\nbeen considering the matter and\ncoul( promise the citizens relief in\nthe near future from stock nuisance.\nHe also stated that some action would\nalso be taken in regard to the side\nwalk ordinance in the near future and\nthat the chief of police had been in\nstructed to see that the promiscuous\nshooting of pistols be checked and to\nuse every effort to arrest the malefac\ntors. ,\n" Alderman Crixell stated that he\nthought the city should have at least\nthree mounted officers at night to\npatrol the city, that with only officers\n, on fpot anyone two blocks away from\nan officer could fire-a pistol and steal\naway before the officer cou\'d possibly\nget to him. He then moved that three\nmounted men be placed on duty at\nnight and that the salary of the men\nbe $40 per month, So that they could\nfeed a horse. This was carried.\nA petition from D.

An automobile\nride into the country was to have\nbeen part of the afternoon program\nfor the entertainment of Mr. McClin\ntock\'s guests bul the rain interfered.\nLights Tonight Owing to some\nwork in cleaning up the machinery\nand getting the boilers into good\nworking order at the city water and\nlight plant,, the city has been neces\nsarily deprived of street lights for\nthe past three nights. The superin\ntendent expects, however, to have the\nlights turned on as usual tonight.\nHouston Team Did Not Come.\nThe negotiations for three games of\nball to be played here against the\nlocals by the Richelieus of Houston\ntoday failed to materialize, Manager\nCummins of the locals having failed\nto receive an answer to his telegram\nof yesterday notifying the Houston\nteam to come. The failure to make\nthe arrangements is opportune per\nhaps, in view of the bad weather.\nFor some time lately Chief of Po\nlice Connor has been receiving com\nplaints from a great many citizens\nthat a chicken thief was nightly mak\ning raids on the fowls in different\nportions of the city. Yesterday a\nMexican by the name of Eugenio\nHerndez was arrested by Chief \'Con\nnor charged with chicken theft. The\nMexican when arrested had a game\nrooster which he stated that he had\nbought, but was unable to give an\nintelligent report.\nMonterey vs. Brownsville. Two\ngames of ball are promised the\nBrownsville fans on Saturday and\nSunday, when the local team will\ncross bats with the crack team from\nMonterey, Mexico, in a series of two\ngames. Since its visit here of last\nyear the Monterey team has added\n1-severaI new players and generally\nstrengthened its team, until now it\nwill "prove a formidable rival to any\namateur team. The keenest interest\nis felt by the baseball lovers of hoth\nBrownsville and Matajnoros and both\ncities will doubtless be well represent\ned at the Park for both games.\nA Crack Ball Player. A new and\nvaluable, acquisition to the Browns\nville ball team is "Brownie" Wicks,\nwho has arrived in the city and from\nnow on will hold down short.\n"Brownie" is one of the best short\nstops in South Texas, having played\nthat position on the Corpus Christi\nteam for several years. Another ad\ndition to the team is Palmwhose home\nis at Austin, -who has been added to\nthe twirling staff. Palm is an old\nhead at basebalf, havinf at one time\nplayed with the San Antonio Bron\nchos and great pitching may be ex\npected o.f him during this season.\nThe Deadly Combat between a\nman-eating African lion and a fero\ncious Mexican bull which will take\nplace Sunday afternoon in the Mata\nmoros bull ring is exciting the most\nintense interest throughout this en\ntire section. The combatants -will be\nplaced in a large steel cage in the\narena in full view of the audience,.\nwhere they will fight until either one\nOr both are dead. Three bulls will\nalso be fought, the bull being of the\nninm i.m?n7vr nn iir,m,.,n ,rT\na HI fe tv"\nr,i m m mm a m m\n"best fighting stock that has ever been\nbrought to Matamoros. The troupe\nincludes- some of the best and most\nnoted bull fighters in the Republic\nof Mexico among whom are Soler, the\nvaulting torero and also one of the\ngreatest banderijleros in the business,\nbeing especially adept in placing the\nshort banderillos and "Moreno," one\nof the. most skilful matadors in Mexi\nco Special rates will be given on all\nrailroads for this occasion. .\ncrrr hack and cart drivers\nRaked Over Coals By the May\n.Must Not Overcharge.\n.All of the hack drivers, draymen\nand water cart men of the city were\ncalled up Monday morning before his\nhonor, Mayor Combe, who gave them\nfa f ree"and forcible lecture. The dray-,-men\nwere informed that they must\n. confine themselves to one side of the\nstreet, and that they must also stop\ni being boisterious and maintain order\nor they would hear from him.\nThe water cart men were raked\n; over the coals by his honor for over\ncharging on water. He informed\nthem that they must conform to the\ncity ordinance regulating the sale of\nwater which places the limit for sel\nling a. barrel of water at 7 cents. He\nstated to them that any found guilty\nof violating thisordlnance would be.\narrested and fined,\nfo the hackmen\'the mayor stated\nthat they would have to be more or\nderly in their driving and that they\nmust not drive their teams faster\nthan a trot through the streets of the\ncity. He also raked them over the\ncoals in regard to the hack ordinance\nwhich prohibits them from charging\nover the regular rate allowed by the\ncity ordinance up to 9 o\'clock at\nnight, after -which the rate is double\nthe day rate. To all of them, the\nmayor stated that nder no circum.\nstances must minors be allowed to\ndrive either hacks, drays or water\ncarts. ! Mr. Rodgers Not 111.\nBy some mistake, it was reported\nin the Galveston News of Sunday that\nGeneral Manager C. B. Rodgers" of\n, the -Brownsville road was ill at the\nSealy hospital in that city .with ty\nphoid fever. This report is denied In\nyesterday\'s Houston Post, which\nsays:\n: "This is a mistake, as Mr. Rodgers\nis\'in Kingsville and \'is physically as\nsound as he-ever was in his life. N;or\n( has Mr. Rodgers been sick even a\nday since he assumed the manage\nment, the first of the year, of the St.\nLouis, Brownsville and Mexico. How\nthe mistake occurred is not Tinown,\n\' nor can Mr. Rodgers himself account\nt for it, as his recent visit to Galveston\n, was in company with his wife and\nbrother, Fred Rodgers of Idaho, and\nthey spent the time there visiting\npoints of interest in the city.\nOut of tlie Ginger Jar.\nEven a legless man can run\nthrough a bank account.\nIt requires a skillful surgeon to\nset a bone, but anybody can set an\negg.\nWhen a girl falls in love with a\nloafer we usually find him the idle of\nher heart.\'\nThere is little expectation that the\nJuly and August sun will melt the ice\ntrust.\nThe corn-field ought to take a high\nrank, because there are so many ker\nnels in it.\n.

The mastodon fell\nhefore him centuries ago, and the\nlion and elephant are his easy prey\ntoday. Even the great snakes and\nsa monsters have disappeared from\nthe regions he has claimed, and in the\nair he seems to have no more foes at\nall.

Twenty years\nago it was believed that malaria was\ncaused by foul air. Today we know\nthat it is transmitted by the anopheles\nmaculipennio, a mosquito. We know,\ntoo, that the stegomyia fasciata, an\nother mosquito transmits yellow fev\ner .that the tsetse fly carries the\ngerms of the sleeping sickness, and\nthat the rat is the bearer of the bu\nbonic plague. Knowing these things,\nwe war upon the \'mosquito, tsetse fly\nand rat and already the effect is\nenormous. Malaria is. dying out in the\nworld -and yellow fever has disap\npeared from even its worst pestholes.\nIn Africa the sleeping sickness is\nabout to yield, and in the Far East\nthe bubonic plague grows less and\nless.\nBut there yet remains another\nbearer of sickness and death the\ncommon house fly and the maladies\nthat he carries still rage. Tuberculosis\n, uuc \' . TV\' " - .x. .\nfever pneumonia and the terrible m-\ntesinal disorders of summer. The\nfly, of course, does not cause these\ndiseases himself but he carries the\ncerms that do. He walks in filth and\nthe microscopic organisms stick to\nhis feet. A moment later he invades\nthe dining rom. Weeks afterward\nthere is illness in the house, and\nmaybe death.\nA great war upon the house fly is\nnow being organized.
