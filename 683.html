What has changed and why? Have these changes\naffected adoption of innovations by farmers? What if anything should policy\nmakers and extension agencies do differently, particularly in developing\ncountries? Structural changes in agriculture, new types of agricultural technologies,\ntight public budgets, efforts to decentralize government, and emerg-\ning information and communication technologies (ICT) have led to pluralistic\nand, in some cases, lower-cost extension and advisory services that combine\npublic and private mechanisms for financing and implementing extension\nactivities. Farmer groups and virtual networks play a growing role in technology\ndiffusion, and extension services can exploit these networks using the lat-\nest ICT approaches.\nKey words: Agricultural extension, technology adoption, pluralistic.\nJEL codes: O3, O4, Q1.\nIntroduction\nAgricultural extension spreads information from local and global research to\nfarmers by accelerating knowledge transfer and helping farmers become better\nmanagers (Huffman 1977; Anderson and Feder 2007). It improves farmer decisions\nand raises productivity, potentially contributing to agricultural develop-\nment and higher incomes (Anderson and Feder 2004, 2007). Agricultural\nextension services are prevalent around theworld, withmore than 90% of public\nextension agents working in developing countries (Swanson and Davis 2014).\nChina alone is estimated to have more than 600,000 extension agents, while\nIndia has 90,000, Indonesia 54,000, and Ethiopia 46,000 (Hu, Huang, and Chen\n2012, p. 21; Swanson and Davis 2014, p. 12). In contrast, the United States has\n© 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy (2020) volume 42, number 1, pp. 8–20.\ndoi:10.1002/aepp.13008\n8\n', 'fewer than 8,000 extension agents, supported by 3,000–4,000 specialistswho generally\nwork in Land-Grant universities or agricultural experiment stations and\nare charged with developing extension materials and programs for agents\n(Swanson and Davis 2014; Wang 2014).\nOver the past four decades, extension has increasingly moved from a traditional\nemphasis on technology transfer and farm management information\nsupplied by the public sector to a broader public and private advisory service\nmode, addressing topics such as marketing, environmental sustainability,\npest diagnostics, and risk management. For a variety of reasons, extension\nsystems have become more pluralistic over time, relying on multiple delivery\nmechanisms and alternative funding sources, public and private (Rivera,\nQamar, and Van Crowder 2001; Bitzer, Wennink, and de Steenhuijsen Piters\n2016; Davis and Franzel 2018). New information and communications technologies\n(ICT) have lowered barriers to information spread, subtly shifting\nextension duties away from message delivery toward transforming scientific\nadvances to make them more accessible to farmers (World Bank 2017). This\npaper highlights changes in extension around the world, why they have\noccurred, and implications for technology adoption. It considers what, if anything,\npolicy makers and public extension agencies should do differently,\nwith an emphasis on developing countries.\nThe changes inmodels of delivery and content reflect the fact that extension\nis undergoing a scientific revolution. Like other scientific revolutions (Kuhn\n1962), two main factors drive these changes: (i) evidence that the existing\nmodels are no longer effective; and (ii) emergence of new paradigms, which\nare the product of better knowledge of the world and better tools for delivery.\nExtension changes may also reflect evolving views about the role of government\nin the economy and shifts in ideology, not always evidence-based,\nabout what works best (Marsh and Pannell 2000).\nEvidence has accumulated over the years that top-down “transfer of technology”\nmodels are ineffective in many environments; rigid recommendations\nwithout the possibility of substitution and adaptation are likely to be rejected;\nand teachingmodels developedwith insufficient understanding of how farmers\nlearn do not successfully build farmer capacity. Studies have highlighted the\nimportance of gender and broad engagement of stakeholders, for example,\nthrough using tools such as participatory variety selection. Farmers do not\nquickly adopt complex packages of technologies but learn by doing and experimentation;\nsequential and selective technology adoption is widespread (Pannell\nand Claassen 2020). Farmers and farming conditions vary widely even within\nrelatively small regions, requiring heterogeneous technologies, flexible packaging,\nand the option to pick and choose among alternatives.\nExtension services in developing countries are becoming more aware of\ntheir role/comparative advantage. They engage less in provision of interventions\nsuch as supervised credit, and more in building broad-based awareness\nof improved practices, utilizing the latest ICT tools related to cell-phone apps\nand distance learning. These tools not only reach farmers with timely information\nbut provide them with in-depth instruction while evaluating success\nand complementing other hands-on diffusion mechanisms.\nExtension Changes\nThe primary role of extension is to improve farmer decision making and\nskills needed to apply agricultural innovations. Traditionally, this role has\nChanges in Agricultural Extension and Implications for Farmer Adoption of New Practices\n9\n', 'been achieved through face-to-face information delivery. How, and by\nwhom, information is delivered and supported has changed as agricultural\nsectors and economies evolve and as new types of agricultural and information/\ncommunication technologies become available. Changes in extension\nhave been driven primarily by (i) structural changes in agriculture that\naccompany economic development, (ii) new agricultural technologies and\nrelated information being developed and disseminated, (iii) new information\nand communication technologies, (iv) uncertain and dwindling public-sector\nfunding for extension, and (v) decentralized government with increased\ninvolvement of local governments in funding and delivering extension services.\nExtension information has always been partly a public and partly a pri-\nvate good, and as the boundaries shift between the two types of goods,\npressures build to reform agricultural extension, in part to save scarce public\nresources (Umali-Deininger 1997; Marsh and Pannell 2000). Data on global\npublic extension funding and personnel are limited, but a gradual decline\nhas occurred in real funding in several countries including the United States\n(Wang 2014), although less so when measured on a per-farmer basis (Jin\nand Huffman 2016).\nStructural Changes\nDue in part to the successes in agricultural research and extension, agricultural\nproductivity growth has resulted in an economic transformation in\nmany countries, with nonfarm income and employment growing relative to\nagricultural income and employment (figures 1 and 2). As the nonfarm sector\nexpands, so too does commercialization of farms to meet the growing\ndemand for quantity and quality of agricultural products. Agriculture\nbecomes more dualistic in nature with small but growing commercial farms\ncoexisting with smaller semisubsistence farms in developing countries and\nlarge commercial farms coexisting with smaller, mostly part-time, commercial\nfarms in developed countries.\nFigure 1 Agriculture’s share of total output and Gross National Income per capita, 2016 (Source:\nWorld Bank, World Development Indicators Online Database accessed 01/2019)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 90000\nA\ngr\nic\nul\ntu\nre\n v\nal\nue\n a\ndd\ned\n (\n%\n o\nf G\nD\nP\n)\nGNI per capita per country (2016 USD)\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n10\n', 'Commercialization of farms increases the demand for client-specific extension\ninformation that can be provided by private firms (Umali-Deininger\n1997). Farmers demand information that improves productivity and also\nhelps them make market and other decisions that will raise profits for their\nincreasingly higher-value products (Alex, Zijp, and Byerlee 2002). This information\nmay come from private advisory services and input suppliers, with a\ngrowing degree of individual farm and field specificity. Individualization of\ninformation moves it into the private domain as profit incentives increase to\nsell the information directly to farmers or to embed it in inputs. As a result\nof the privatization of some extension, public extension services can redirect\ntheir efforts at other issues, such as the needs of smaller-scale, noncommercial\nfarmers or addressing natural resource/environmental problems for which\nthe information remains a public good. Extension in developed countries\nhas felt that shift in emphasis to a greater degree than developing countries,\nbut the changing mandate for public extension is a global phenomenon.\nChanges in Agricultural Technologies and Information\nAgricultural information can be embodied in purchased inputs such as\nimproved seeds, machinery, and bio-pesticides, or it can be disembodied\ninformation about agricultural practices or markets (Umali-Deininger 1997;\nAnderson and Feder 2004, 2007). Disembodied information may be a public\ngood (nonexcludable), such as information about market trends or weatherbased\ncrop-disease predictions, or a privately chargeable (excludable, fee-\nfor-service) good, such as pest diagnoses or fertilizer recommendations for\nspecific plots on individual farms. The proportion of information embedded\nin inputs has increased over time as capital and materials expenditures have\ngrown significantly around the world. Demand for farm-specific fee-forservice\ninformation on agricultural practices has also increased, in developed\ncountries and to some extent in developing countries, especially by largescale\ncommercial farmers (Rivera, Blum, and Sulaiman 2009). Most states in\nFigure 2 Agriculture’s share of total employment and Gross National Income per capita, 2016\n(Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators Online Database accessed 01/2019)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 90000\nE\nm\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt i\nn \nag\nric\nul\ntu\nre\n (\n%\n o\nf t\not\nal\n)\nGNI per capita per country (2016 USD)\nChanges in Agricultural Extension and Implications for Farmer Adoption of New Practices\n11\n', 'the United States now charge fees for a portion of their publicly supplied\nextension services and their activities are complemented by private agricultural\nadvisory services. Mexico has developed a fee-for-service system for\nlarge-scale farmers (Wilson 1991); Nicaragua has done the same for farms of\na variety of sizes (Dinar and Keynan 2001). In Honduras, farmers recently\nwere found to pay about 9% of the cost of extension services (Valenzuela\nand Saavedra 2017).\nThe private sector now has an incentive to play a larger role in disseminating\nagricultural information than it did when more of the information was a\npublic good. As private sector involvement in extension has grown, the public\nsector has changed its emphasis, its size and structure. In some cases, the public\nsector role has been replaced by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\nin developing countries—although many NGOs are partially supported with\npublic funds—and by private advisory services. Extension is currently more\ndiversified than when it was dominated by public extension services.\nExtension has also moved, albeit slowly, in the direction toward gender\nneutrality in many countries. Research has shown that gender bias can constrain\nagricultural productivity (Jafry and Sulaiman 2013; Quisumbing et al.\n2014), a fact that extension services seemed largely unaware of four decades\nago. Today, extension services in many countries function with greater gender\nbalance in reaching out to male and female decision makers, although\nadditional progress is needed (Quisumbing et al. 2014; Rola-Rubzen\net al. 2020).\nChanges in Information and Communication Technologies\nThe information and communication technology revolution has reached\nthe tipping point where most farmers have cell phone access that agricultural\nextension and advisory systems can target with low-cost and timelymessages\n(Aker 2011). Some limited-resource farmers in developing countries remain\ndisadvantaged with respect to certain types of mass media hardware such\nas computers and smartphones, but extension and advisory systems are rapidly\ngaining clients for a broad array of mass media programming among\nlarge and small commercial farmers. Many, but not all, of the messages are\nsimpler than those transmitted through face-to-face instruction, but the number\nof farmers reached is growing at a relatively low cost. Improved weather\nand disease forecasts, market information, insect and disease diagnostics and\nrecommendations, and timely reminders of critical farm practices are just a\nfew examples. Studies have emerged on the effectiveness of some of these\napproaches to delivering extension information (Aker 2011; Larochelle\net al. 2019).\nFunding Support\nGovernment and international donor financing for agricultural extension\nwas strong in the 1970s and 1980s but has since declined in real terms inmany\ncountries (Davis and Franzel 2018). The World Bank provided resources for\nits Training and Visit (T&V) extension system to dozens of countries in the\n1980s and 1990s (Anderson and Feder 2007). However, during the 1990s, with\ngrowing evidence that the T&V systemwas not particularly cost effective, as a\npublic debt crisis plagued several countries, especially in Latin America and\nAfrica, and as donors pressed governments to reduce fiscal deficits, many\ncountries substantially reduced funding for extension programs. The fact that\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n12\n', 'agriculture was shrinking as a proportion of the economy, that populations\nwere rapidly urbanizing, and that investments in other public assets such as\nroads, water, and irrigation systems were more visible, made the cutbacks\nto extension politically feasible. The hope was that the private sector would\nstep in, which it did to a certain extent, but in a targeted fashion.\nGovernment Decentralization\nSeveral countries (e.g., the Philippines, Nepal, Uganda, Colombia) have\nmoved toward decentralized provision of government services, including\nthe service of public agricultural extension. This decentralization devolves\nspecific administrative functions from central to local (i.e., state and municipal)\ngovernments, increasing their independence from the center, but requir-\ning reorganization of public services such as extension units. Extension agents\nmove from national and regional offices to local communities and report to\nlocal public officials rather than higher-level ministry or extension agency\nadministrators. A purpose of this change is to have extension be led by farmer\ndemand and to make it accountable to locally elected officials. Local governments\nmay have more incentive to financially support the extension pro-\ngrams, and lack of adequate funding has been a major issue for many\nextension systems. Decentralization may also facilitate production and delivery\nof site-specific information. One danger of decentralization is that exten-\nsion agents can be viewed as being politically motivated or being the eyes\nand ears of the government rather than objective purveyors of agricultural\ninformation. Some economies of scale may be lost as well, resulting in higher\ncosts (although travel costs for agents may be reduced). Decentralization has\nworked relatively well in developed countries such as the United States,\nwhere extension is closely linked to a decentralized and state-based university\nresearch system. Local governments help share the burden of funding\nlocal extension agents, backstopped by state-level specialists.\nIn developing countries, the results of decentralized extension have been\nmixed. For example, in Uganda, decentralization improved participation\nand control over extension service delivery by local communities. However,\nextension programs still face challenges of inadequate local funding, dependence\non unreliable and conditional central government grants, difficulty in\nattracting and retaining staff, and corruption and capture by local elites\n(Bashaasha, Mangheni, and Nkonya 2011).\nEffects of Extension Changes\nChanges in economic structure, agricultural innovations, ICT innovations,\nfunding, and extension decentralization have gradually resulted in changes\nto how extension delivery systems are organized and financed. A typology\nof how various extension services are currently provided and financed is presented\nin table 1. Some services, such face-to-face on-farm advice, have\nmoved over time from being almost exclusively publicly provided to increasingly\nprivately provided (with the farmer paying), except for limited resource\nfarmers. Groupmeetingswith farmers, field days, demonstrations, andworkshops\nare still mainly publicly provided but with increased financing by\nfarmers themselves and NGOs, the latter often serving as conduits for donor\nand government funding. The season-long farmer field school training is\nmostly publicly supported and delivered or provided by NGOs with public/donor\nsupport. Given the cost per farmer participant, the prevalence of\nChanges in Agricultural Extension and Implications for Farmer Adoption of New Practices\n13\n', 'these field schools may decline over time as public financing is reduced,\nalthough probably not as precipitously as the T&V System of the 1970s to\n1990s did after the World Bank cut its support for the approach. The field\nschool approach is highly participatory, if not always as demand-driven as\nit appears, and active participation is the preferred learning approach where\nfunds allow.\nLed by the ICT revolution, a significant change has occurred in the nature\nand importance of mass media in agricultural extension (Aker 2011). Printed\nreports, pamphlets, and fliers, which are primarily produced and financed by\nthe public sector, have declined in number precipitously, while electronic\nmass media of all types have exploded in importance because of their ability\nto reach a large audience in a timely fashion at low cost. There is currently a\ntug of war occurring in developing countries between participatory, intensive\nextension approaches such as farmer field schools, which reach a narrow but\ntargeted small-farm audience, and electronic mass media approaches, which\nprovide information to the masses quickly and cheaply. Electronic media can\nalso be used to provide individualized information; one example is the rice\ncrop manager app promoted in the Philippines (https://phapps.irri.org/\nph/rcm/). Despite the sizable growth of farmer field school programs around\nthe developing world, electronic messaging appears to be gaining the upper\nhand, certainly in terms of private delivery and financing of extension services,\nbut also in the public arena, because it can reach large numbers of\nfarmers relatively cheaply. Helping farmers learn in a cost-effective manner\nis a major challenge for agricultural extension services.\nDespite the growth in electronic mass media, face-to-face group programs,\nworkshops, and field days still absorb the bulk of the public extension budget\nin most countries and will likely continue to for years to come. Face-to-face\ninteractions are more amenable to delivering complex messages than the\nmass media that they complement. Field days, especially when combined\nwith hands on demonstrations, can raise the value of some types of electronically\nprovided information (Larochelle et al., 2019). Even as stand-alone\nTable 1 Typology of Typical Extension Services\nExtension services\nDelivery\nmechanisms\nFinancing\nmechanisms\nFace-to-face advisory services for\nindividual farmers\nPublic and\nprivate\nPublic and private\n(by farmers)\nGroup meetings with farmers/\ndemonstrations/ field days/workshops\nMostly public Public and private\nSeason-long farmer field schools/training Public and\nprivate\n(NGOs)\nPublic\nPrinted extension reports and pamphlets Public Public\nRadio and TV programs targeted at farmers Public and\nprivate\nPublic and private\nPhone and computer messaging for farmers\n(mass media)\nPublic and\nprivate\nPublic and private\n(Pest) diagnostic services Public and\nprivate\nPublic and private\n(by farmers)\nProduct quality certification Public and\nprivate\nPublic and private\n(by farmers)\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n14\n', 'events, farmer field days have been found to be a highly effective technology\ndiffusion mechanism (Emerick et al. 2017). Extension in most countries has\nbecome pluralistic, with a combination of delivery methods; some methods\nare better at delivering simple information and others better at delivering\ncomplex information, public budgets are limited, and the ability to privatize\nand individualize messages differs by type of information (Ricker-Gilbert\net al. 2008).\nIn developing countries, NGOs and private agribusiness input and information\nsuppliers have added to the financial support for private extension\nand to the types of extension methods employed. Donor-funded projects in\ndeveloping countries have helped fund public extension efforts for decades.\nThe degree and institutionalization of pluralistic extension systems vary\ngreatly by country, but most developing countries have moved in this direction,\neven if unintentionally (Bitzer, Wennink, and de Steenhuijsen\nPiters 2016).\nThe structural changes that occur in agriculture around the world continue\nto exert a significant influence on extension. As the agricultural sector shrinks\nrelative to the nonagricultural sector and incomes grow, fewer people are\nfamiliar with the needs of farmers, but countries can more easily afford to\nsupport agricultural extension services. In poor countries, donors often play\na significant role in the content and approach to extension. Donor involvement\nmay mean less government ownership and involvement, and a gap\ncan grow between the needs of the expanding commercial farm sector and\nthe remaining semisubsistence farms.\nHave changes to extension systems affected agricultural productivity or\nreturns to extension investments? Public resources are spread thin in extension,\nand adoption of complex knowledge-intensive technologies remain lim-\nited in many countries, but diffusion of agricultural innovations and growth\nin agricultural productivity continue in most countries. Globally, total agricultural\noutput grows at about 2.5% annually, with total factor productivity\n(TFP) growth accounting for about three-fourths of this increased output\n(Fuglie and Rada 2013). Unfortunately, productivity growth has been less of\na factor in agricultural growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, where public and private\nextension is weakest. TFP growth there has only averaged about 1% in\nrecent years (Fuglie and Rada 2013), although it does appear to be rising in\nthe last decade in some countries. Economic rates of returns to agricultural\nextension in Sub-Saharan Africa have frequently been reported in the range\nof 30–100%, although methodological issues cast doubt on the validity of\nthe estimates in some studies (Jin and Huffman 2016; Pardey et al. 2016). A\nmetastudy of economic rates of return to agricultural research and extension\nfound a mean rate of return of 58% for extension across 289 studies (Alston\net al. 2000).\nAgricultural extension in general is one of history’s most widespread publicly\nsupported efforts to foster agricultural development (Anderson and\nFeder 2007). Billions of farmers have had contact with extension systems over\nthe past few decades. However, despite the size of the endeavor, and its constant\nclaim on scarce resources, relatively few econometrically estimated eco-\nnomic returns to extension programs have been estimated. The scarcity of\nsuch estimates is due to limited data available on extension expenditures over\ntime and across countries and the difficulty of statistical identification of the\nrelevant effect. Econometric-based studies exist, e.g., Jin and Huffman (2016)\nand Marsh, Pannell, and Lindner (2000, 2004), but most evaluations have\nChanges in Agricultural Extension and Implications for Farmer Adoption of New Practices\n15\n', 'focused on specific extension practices or localized programs, and many of\nthose have suffered from selection bias. The difficulty in directly attributing\neconomic impacts to extension efforts may be one factor that limits its political\nsupport, leading to small extension budgets for the immense task (Anderson\nand Feder (2007).\nEfforts have been made to econometrically evaluate impacts of specific\nextension interventions such as field days, cell-phonemessaging, or extension\nvisits. The effects of farmer field days were evaluated in a randomized control\ntrial (RCT) in 100 villages in the state of Odisha (Emerick et al. 2017). The field\ndays were found to increase adoption of a flood-tolerant rice variety by 40%.\nAn RCT in Ecuador found that cellphone text reminders increased adoption\nof IPM practices in potatoes (Larochelle et al. 2019). Dercon et al. (2009) found\nthat receiving at least one extension visit reduced significantly the poverty\nheadcount and increased consumption in rural Ethiopia.\nInternational development agencies have provided significant support to\nextension efforts; more than $10 billion since the 1960s (Anderson and Feder\n2007). These agencies often favor projects and programs that directly influence\nwide diffusion of new technologies to farmers. Unfortunately, the avail-\nability of donor support may be one factor that hinders its support by\ndomestic agricultural ministries. As donor support shifts toward extension\nprivatization efforts, limited-resource farmers may be the ones who are most\nneglected due to the difficulty of implementing cost recovery schemes\n(Swanson and Rajalahti 2010).\nSuggestions for Policy Makers and Public Extension Agencies\nInmany countries, especially in the developingworld, tight public budgets,\nreform efforts such as decentralization, and emerging ICT technologies have\nled to pluralistic extension and advisory services that combine public and private\nmethods for financing and implementing extension activities (Davis and\nFranzel 2018). This pluralism facilitates flexibility, encourages demanddriven\nservices, and relieves part of the financial burden on the public sector.\nHowever, it also complicates coordination to ensure that the needs of all\nfarmers are met, not just large commercial farmers. It creates challenges for\nensuring that extension providers are accountable, economies of scale are\nachieved, and that the public sector extension service is not starved for\nresources or eliminated. Elimination of public extension may mean that the\ndemands of limited resource farmers or for environmental improvement go\nunmet. The differing roles of the multiple extension service providers, including\npublic extension, private suppliers of inputs and services, NGOs, and pro-\nducer groups, must be considered in this coordination. Decentralization can\nhelp with accountability and assist in meeting needs of heterogeneous clients,\nbut requisite resources are also needed for monitoring and especially for evaluation.\nEvaluation can be used to determine what works, what does not, and\nwhat combination of approaches is most cost-effective for the country. Extension\nservices often have monitoring and evaluation units, but they typically\nemphasize monitoring and do not measure what works and what does not.\nThere is too little learning in extension—or creative thinking about evaluation\nand impact.\nDecentralizing program planning and management with strong client participation\nthat links public extension to sources of new information is needed,\nkeeping the system just political enough to secure resources but not so\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n16\n', 'political to be captured by those in power. Overly politicized systems lose\ncredibility, and eventually lose funding when farmers view them merely as\neyes and ears of the government rather than providers of information. The\npoliticization of public extension agencies in Ecuador and Honduras led to\ntheir dissolution several years ago. In India, with the second largest extension\nsystem in the world, extension changed from a centralized T&V system in the\n1970s to 1990s to a decentralized model more recently led by the Agricultural\nTechnology Management Agency (ATMA), in part due to the financial burden\nof T&V. ATMA is a multistakeholder autonomous agency that involves\nfarmer groups, NGOs, private groups, and public extension agents with linkages\nto research through the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)\nand district-level Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), which provide technology\ntesting and training (Ferroni and Zhou 2012). The jury is still out on the overall\nsuccess of this decentralized pluralistic model, although it appears that the\nneeds of many smallholders are still being neglected.\nThe trend toward stakeholder cost sharing is likely to continue and the\nmodel must be designed to serve farmers of all types if society is to benefit\noverall. As fiscal difficulties continue with public extension systems,\nprivate-public partnerships (PPPs) are one mechanism for reducing their\nmagnitude, whether extension information is embedded in products or\nadvice. One model for reaching small farmers with the “last mile” of extension\nservice for small holders is to encourage linkages between extension\nand farmer groups. These linkages can take many forms. In the coffee zone\nof Colombia, the National Federation of Coffee Growers transmits information\nto farmer groups in rural neighborhoods through periodic meetings\nand demonstrations in addition to use of electronic media. In Niger, public\nextension transmits information to smallholders through regionally important\nfarmer federations that have units at the village level. In Nepal, iDE, an\ninternational NGO, has assisted rural communities in selecting “Community\nBusiness Facilitators” (CBFs) from among their local groups. These facilitators\nreceive short term training from public extension agencies and/or donors so\nthey can help diagnose pest and other crop problems but are linked to local\ninput suppliers in an arrangement that pays a percentage of the sales price\nto the CBFs for products they purchase and distribute to others in the village.\nIt is critical for public and private extension suppliers to fully embrace and\nexploit application of the latest ICT for innovation diffusion. These new technologies\nhave the potential to accelerate and broaden information diffusion to\nfarmers, and complement other extension methods, can be cost effective to\nimplement, can help extension systems learn about what works, and can help\nin diagnosing problems (Bitzer, Wennink, and de Steenhuijsen Piters 2016).\nICT-based extension information may reduce gender bias by providing\ninformation to women-headed limited-resource households in their homes\nif female access to ICT is not lower than for men (World Bank 2017, p. 71).\nWomen are often at least as interested as men in participating in social networks\non- or offline if they have access. Farmer groups and virtual networks\nplay an increasingly important role in technology diffusion. Extension servicesmust\ntake advantage of these networks (World Bank 2017). For example,\nproducts such as WhatsApp and other cell-phone-based networking and\nmessaging apps are becoming common even in developing countries, and\ntheir use in extension is growing rapidly for topics such as crop pest diagnosis\nand recommendations (Davis and Franzel 2018; Beriya and Saroja 2019). Indepth\ndecision-making skills can be transmitted via webinars and other\nChanges in Agricultural Extension and Implications for Farmer Adoption of New Practices\n17\n', 'distance learning tools as farmer access to computers expands in developing\ncountries.\nStrong in-service training is important for any extension service, but even\nmore so as the ICT technologies change as rapidly as the agricultural technologies.\nHistorically strong extension systems such as the one run by the\nNational Federation of Coffee Growers in Colombia run frequent in-service\ntraining while also ensuring that the overall system is demand driven. Successful\nextension depends onmaintaining strong linkages to the latest innova-\ntions developed through public and private research.\nReferences\nAker, J.C. 2011.
