A. Estabrook hill\nsoutheast of town, as Mr. Trail\nwas returning from Higginsville\nwhere he had driven Mrs. Ver\nden, wife of the accused, and\nMrs. Bedwell. Mr. Verden was\nemployed at Herd & Kroencke\'s\nand left there about 2 :30, saying\nthat he wanted to do some shop\nping up the street; instead he\nwent out on the Higginsville\nroad armed with a revolver, and\nthere waited for the car to pass.\nHe hailed Mr. -Trail, who was\nmaking every effort to stop, as\nit was found later that the brak\nes were set and the gas turned\noff. The car, however, was still\nin gear, and this may be explain\ned by the fact that the bullet\nwhich entered through the spine\n. and came out through the left\nbreast, caused instant paraly\nsis of Mr. Trail\'s body from the\nabdomen down.\nDr. Chalkley was notified and\nhe went out to the sceneof the\nshooting. He drove the car with\nits occupants to Mr Trail\'s\nhome where he was given every\nattention. His condition is ex\ntremely critical owing to the,pa\nralysis of the abdominal organs.\nMrs. Verden first called John\nHogan to make the trip, but\ndisagreed on the price. She then!\ncalled Grover Calmese, who was\nnot available, and then Mr. Trail.\nAnd so. it. was thp.t Mr.-T-nil\nbecame the victim of her hus- and Fletcher Cox, and the groom 000\nband s rage.\nVerden is reported as saying\nthat his shooting Mr. Trail was\naccidental, that he was shooting\nat the tires in his effort to stop\nthe car. But how the other oc\ncupants, Mrs. Verden and Mrs.\nBedwell, escaped that fusilade\nof shots is somewhat of a mir\nacle. Five shots were fired and\nthree were found to have enter\ned the back of the car, one went\nhigher up through the curtain\nand the other hit Mf.

DELAWARE\nTO DELE\nWARE fulls the honor\nof belig the\nfirst of the\noriginal thir\nteen states.\nDecember 7,\n1T87, It oflletally adopted tbe Con--stitut\nion and thus was made a\nbeginning of our present Federal\ngovernment. According to the\nseventh article of the Constitu\ntion, however, it was necessary\nfor nine states to ratify It before\nit actually came Into force. So\nIt was not until the following\nJune, by which time eight other\nstates laid accepted the Consti\ntution, that the United States of\nAmerica actually came Into be\ning.\nThe early history of Delaware\nwas a varied one. It started In\n10.\'18 when a small party of\nSwedes settled at the mouth of\nthe Delaware river and called It\nNew Sweden. In 1C55, Peter\nStuyvesant. the governor of tbe\nDutch colony of New Nether\nlands, annexed this territory, liut\nIt did not long remain Dutch,\nfor In 1064 the English took\npossession. When Pennsylvania\nwas deeded to William I\'enn lie\ndesired access to tbe sencoast\nand at his urgent request Dela\nware was transferred to I\'enn\'s\nproprietorship. From the be\nginning of the eighteenth cen\ntury, however, Delaware hud its\nseparate legislature, and at the\ntime of the Kevolutiun It be\ncame an Independent state.\nDelaware Is next to the small\nest of our states, havK.g an uren\nof only 2,370 square miles. Its\nparticipation In presidential elec\ntions Is limited to three electors.\nThis Is arranged according to\npopulation. Each state is entitled\nto the same number of presiden\ntial electors as It has members\nof congress, so the Influence of\nthe different states in voting for\nthe President varies from Dela\nware\'s three electors to New\nYork\'s 45.\nAs to the derivation of the\n\' name Delaware, this was appro\npriately given to the state from\nthe river, which In turn was\nnamed nfter the bay and the hay\nwas called Delaware In honor of\nLord Delaware, wh was gover\nnor of the Virginia colony in\nIWO.\n( by JlcClur Nawp;er 8\'nIU\'U.)\nArmored Inner Tires\n26,000 Miles Without Tuneture or Blowout\nNew Life for Old Tires.
