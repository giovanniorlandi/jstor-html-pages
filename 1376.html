Showers occurred\nover most of the state, except in the\nextreme west portion. In the nor\nthern and central counties they were\nmore frequent than over the south.\nOver most of the south and in some\nsections which had escaped earlier\nheavy rains and showers were bene\nficial, but generally over the north\ndamage resulted. The soil is wet\nand work has been delayed. Fields\nare generally very foul and badly\nin need of cultivation. Many of the\nriver bottoms are covered with water\nnnd it is feared that no crops what\never will be produced therein during\nthe present season. The cotton pros\npects have deteriorated in the cen\ntral and northern counties during\nthe week. Much cotton remains to\nbe planted in these counties and the\nwork has been greatly delayed. That\nwhich is up is not generally in prom\nising condition, though in some lo\ncalities which escaped the excessive\nrains, the crop is in good condition.\nThe fields nre generally very foui as\ncultivation has been delayed by the\nwet weather. Chopping has also\nbeen delayed. In the south and\nsouthwest the crop *s generally in\ngood condition and good growth has\nbeen made during the week. Culti\nvation was prevented to some exient\nby showers and some fields are foul.\nChopping has been jc< . : 1 and much\nof this work is romp\'.\' d. Squares\nare forming in inc.- -mthern coun\nties. The area affected bv the boll\nweevil has increased, though not so\nserious as has been reported. Cut\nworms and other pests are working\nin cotton in various parts of the\nstate. In some northern counties\nthe prospects for corn is good, but\ngenerally believed to be deteriorat\ned. The wet weather has been in\njurious and the crop does not have\na healthy appearance. Fields are\nvery foul and badly in need of cultiva\ntion. Much less corn will be plant\ned. In the south the corn crop is in\na fair conditio·.\nNotice.\nTo the l^adies of Waxahachie and\nSurrounding Country:\nThere has been a report started\nthat the Leader Millinery store was\ngoing out of business after this sea\nson.
