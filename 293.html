The robber is supposed to be\na young Italian by the name of An\ngelo. who has been working for the\nPardinis on their ranch south of Car\nson, near the Mexican dam. The loss\nnf the money was not discovered un\ntil late in the evening, but it is\nthought it was taken somewhere\nabout 1 o\'clock. The money was in\na trunk, but about 6 o\'clock last even\ning one of the Pardjnis went to the\ntrunk to add $300 more, when he\nfound the trunk had been broken open\nby the breaking of the lock and the\nmoney was gone.\nAngelo had been seen earlier in the\nafternoon as he was leaving the\nhouse. lie had with him a shot gun\nand it was thought he was going\nhunting and therefore his actions did\nnot excite suspicion\nThe sheriff\'s office was not notified\nuntil 7:30 last evening, when a search\nwas started for the boy. It was\nlearned that Angelo had come into\nlown and gone to the Raycraft gar\nace to hire an auto to take him to\nReno.-giving as a reason his sister\nwas dying there. There was no auto\nnot in tisc at the garage and WiVi\nKnipipfivberg was engaged to take\nhim over to the-riversidc city, which\nhe did about 4 o\'clock im the after\nnoon.

The pre-election\nWall Street "bull" in regard to bet\ning odds seems to have been diss\nated and in Reno has had little or\nno effect upon actual wagers that\n\'lave been made. Instead of being an\nIds on favorite, as reported from\n\'cw York, Hughes has been backed\nlown to even mcmey and offers are\nK\'ing heard to back Wilson at odds.\nAlthough not confirmed officially.\ni it is rumored that Charles Stout has\njiwt itrade the following wagers: One\nthousand dollars on Wilson, even\nmoney; $600 to $200 on Senator Key\nPittman: $40 even that Grant Miller\nwill beat Sam Piatt for senatorship.\nFreak bets are much in evidence in\npicking out combinations. Owing to\ntheir past "close decisions" the bet\nting ii even on Burke and.Ferrel for\nsheriff. Moore and Lunsford will\nmake a pretty race for district attor\nney, but there is absolutely no ques\ntion about Frank Golden, Democrat\n\'or assembly, and it looks like he will\narry the whole ticket with him.\nD\nWILL ROBERTS TELL WHY?\nOn the inside of a four-page circular distributed\nthroughout Carson this morning, and bearing\nthe endorsement of the Republican State Central\nCommittee, appears the headline\n"Piatt and Roberts Ae-Qpposed to the v\nPittman Land Grab"\nWe know why Piatt opposes the bill, but will\nRoberts tell his Carson friends why his change\nafter his statement before a congressional com\nmittee that\n"I should be ashamed to appear before any\npeople asking their suffrage if I should hesitate\nto support a bill simply because a man who rep\nresents another party introduced it. I believe\nthe bill is right."\nREVUE STATE\nGET F\nThe Appeal has repeatedly charg\ned that the opposition to the Pittman\nland grant bill has come from the\nstockmen of the state. That charge\nhas not been refuted by cither the\nstockmen, the Reno Journal, the Reno\nGazette. Sam Piatt or Grant Miller.\nThe Appeal reiterates that state\nment and challenges the Reno Jour\nnal, the Reno Gazette, Sam Piatt,\nGrant Miller or the stockmen to- suc\ncessfully disprove it.\nNow for a little consideration of\nthe bill: Section 2 of the bill reads:\n"That the lands herein granted shall\nbe selected by said state from any\nunappropriated and unreserved non\nmineral ipublic lands in said state in\nquantities not less than the smallest\nsubdivision." Section 3 in part says\n"that the land herein granted shall\nbe disposed of to citizens (" f the\nUnited States by sale to the highest\nbidder at public auction upon due\nnotice and at not less than $1.25 per\nacre, under such laws, rules and reg\nulations as may now or hereafter be\nprescribed by the legislature of t\'.ie\nstate of Nevada, not inconsistent\nherewith; provided, that not more\nthan one-half million acres of said\nland so granted shall be disposed of\neach year by said state; provided,\n\'"urther. that any citizen of the Unit\ned States shall- be entitled to pur\nchase not more than 640 acres and\nnot less than 40 acres of such lands\nrnder the terms and in the manner\nprovided in this bill."\nSection 4 in part reads: "That the\nproceeds arising from the USE, dis\nposal or sale of such lands, or any\npart thereof, shall be for the use and\nbenefit of the public schools of Ne\nvada and the state university in the\nfollowing proportions," etc.\nUnder the terms and conditions of\nthe grant the state cannot dispose of\nmore than 500,000 acres in one year\nBut that does not prevent the state\nalter the lull becomes a law, irom se\nlecting the entire 7.000,000 . acres a?\nsoon as a commission is "provided for\nby legislative enactment and the leg-\nlsianon necessary ro saieguarci tin-\ngrant and an appropriation made for\nthe ! expense of the commission in\nmaking the selection of the lands\nThe state does not have to sell any\nof those lands if it does not so de\nsire. In section 4 appear the words\n"proceeds arising from tneCSE, dis\nposal or sale x " What\ndoes that mean?- Does it not mean\nthat the state does not have "to sell\nan acre of land, but can grant yearly\npermits for the use of the land just\n; s the government does with the for\ntst reserve and receive a stipend for\nthat use? And that is just what the\nstockmen are afraid of and why they\nl,i M BILL\nare fighting the bill. Those lands that\ncould be selected by the state they\nare now using free. Now, to put it\nup to you as a business proposition:\nDon\'t you think that the state will\nselect the lands that the stockmen\nare now using free and not the bot\ntom lands that cannoi be made prof\nitable for farming on account of the\nlack of water and that the lands now\nused free by the stockmen are not of\nany use whatsoever for farming pur\nposes? Those lands are in the hills\nand ranges and no one wants a home\nstead there or to buy that land for\nfarming purposes. But the stock\nmen want it. for it is waterecf\'by the\nsnows in the winter and makes good\ngrazing for cattle and sheep in the\nsummer.\n- e i . . .\nsuppose, ior illustration, mat you j\nas aeitizen were told that you could\nhave 1,1,00,000 acres of land donated\nto you by the government by com\nplying with certain conditions, and\ncould select that land from any that\nwas not otherwise appropriated;\nwould you not look around and see\nwhich lands would yield the quickest\nrevenue? What would you find? You\nwould find acres upon acres of bot\ntom land that could be .selected, but\nthere is no water on it and no means\nof securing irrigation, so consequent\nly you would, pass it up, but on the\nother hand you would see millions\nupon millions pi acres in the hills\nand ranges now being used by the\nstock interests free. You would nat\nurally say, if you had any business\nsagacity, "there are the lands i am\ngoing to select, for the reason that\nwlicu I get my deed to those lands\nthe stockmen will have to pay me a\nrental for the use of them, just as\nihey pay the government for the us\nof the lands of the forest reserve, ana\nI will only give them a yearly\npermit, instead of a long term least\nwhich will permit them to fence in\nthe lands. By this selection and this\nprocedure I will at once be in posses\nsion of a yearly, income from lano\nthat is of no earthly use to any one\nexcept stockmen and they, to sustain\nlife in their cattle and sheep, have\ngot to have them." That is just the\nposition the state of Nevada will be\nin when this 7,000,000 acre grant is\ndeeded to it.\nRemember, the state can select the\nentire acreage at once and wherever\nit is unappropriated, provided it does\nnot contain mineral in payable quan\ntities. Remember also that fhe state\nHoes not have to sell one acre of it.\nbut that it can give a yearly or term\npermit for the use of it and receive a\nrental for every acre. This in simple\nis the land grant bill" and if there\nis any "grab" in it the state of\nGERMANS LEAVE\nPRACTICALLY\n-r-u\nBerlin Reports Teutons Make Ad\nj vances Off Allied Front and Cap\nture Russian Positions South of\nVitoniez-Rumanians Are Holding\nTheir Own In Transylvania\nBy United Press\nBERLIN, Nov.\' 2.

But it\ns because these powers are given\nthe state that the stock interests art\nlighting the bill, for they will be de\nprived of . land they now get the use\nof free. .\'The Reno Journal, the Rene\nGazette, Sam Piatt and Gr:mt Miller\nknow these facts as well as the Ap\npeal does and when they say that the\nstate will be robbed by reason of the\nprovisions of the Pittman land granl\noill they speak with insincerity.\nAgain, the land grant bill says that\nthe-land shall be disposed of (when\nsold) at public auction to the high\nest bidder, but it does not say when\nit shall be disposed of, if ever; it is\nnot mandatory in that respect and\nthere is no time limit set for its dis\nposition. Why, therefore, dispose o\nland that is fit tor no otner purpose\nthan that of grazing stock when the\nstate can derive a yearly income from\nit and still own it?\nThe state of Nevada, if it secures\nthis magnificent allotment of land\nfrom the government, will be in posi\ntion to dictate to the stockmen and\ncompel them to ipay tribute for the\nland they now get the use of free.\nThat is the milk in the cocoanut and\nthat is the main reason for the fight\nagainst the bill.\nFORT AFTER\nIT\nThe Russian losses were heavy.\nLocal enterprises against the Russian\nadvanced their ipositions north of\nDorna Vatra.\nRussian Report\nfBy United Press\nPETROGRAD, Nov. 2.

In her -recent trip\nthrough the northern part of the\ncounty she met with a hearty re\nsponse and will come into Reno .with!\na. strong, backing that is being en\nhanced by her many friends here,\nMrs. Cunningham is a native of\nMichigan,\' where she was born in\n1890. .She graduated from high\nschool at the age of IS years, after\nwards attending the Young Ladie3;\nSeminary at Godfrey, 111. Still later\nshe studied art in Chicago.\nAfter coming west several years\nago she took a course in bookkeeping\nand through considerable experience\nin this line of work she has qualified\nherself most fittingly for the position\nshe seeks at the hands of Democratic\nvoters. Two years ago she was mar\nried to Francis J. Cunningham, the\npresent city attorney of Sparks.\nThose who know Mrs. Cunningham\nspeak very highly of her abilities and\ndeclare that she has every claim for\nthe \'Oiffice she is fighting for. With\nDemocratic victory assured on state\nand national issues, Mrs. Cunning\nham will be one of the strong Dem\nocratic vote-getters on the county\nticket.\nSpeakers Talk of\nPittman Land Bill\nC. L. Deady, surveyor general, and\nJ. M. Frame, Reno attorney, address\ned a full house at the C. and C\ntheater last evening. Mr. Deady took\nas his theme the Pittman land grant\nbill and showed that it would be a\nbenefit to Nevada if properly safe\nguarded and that safeguarding it was\nup to the state authorities. The gov\nernment in granting the land had sur\nrounded it with the same precautions\nthat accompanied grants to the var\nious states of the Union and it wa\nup to the individual states to protect\ntheir own possessions.\nMr. Frame, who has been a leader\nin the Socialist ranks of Nevada, told\nwhy he was going to support Presi\ndent Wilson and the Democratic national-officers.\nThey had kept their\npledges with the people and had ac\ncomplished more progressive legis\nwxx i I\nX A.\nm Look!\nDuritv in the can and purity in the\nlation than any administration that\nhad ever been in control at Wash1\nmgton. Mr. Frame then took uo the\nPittman land grant bill and tore to\npieces the arguments its opponents\nhad made against it. His argument\nin brief was that the grant was a\ngreat thing for the state and meant\nmuch for its future development, and\nthat of the people, officers or legis\nlature of the state were incapable of\ntaking care of the grant and protect\ning it they did not deserve any favors\nat the hands of the government.\nThe meeting was held under the\nauspices of the Democratc County\nCentral committee and was (presided\nover by Jack Richards.\noo\nPleasant Evening\nat Leisure Hour\nWhen Mrs. B. V. Coleman called\nthe Leisure Hour club to order last\nevening there sat with her Mrs. S.\nP. Davis, the first president of the\nNevada State Federation of Women\'s\nclubs, and Mrs. P. B. Ellis, the new\nly elected president. Mrs. Coleman\nrequested Mrs. Davis to preside dur\ning the evening and the latter spoke\nof the growth of the Federation from\nthe time of its organization with only\nfour clubs, to the present time when\nover thirty clubs are affiliated in the\nstate organization. She also spoke\nof the honor paid the Leisure Hour\nclub when the Federation chose one\nof the Leisure Hour members, Mrs.\nP. B. Ellis, to be state president for\nthe next two years.\nThe sipeakers of the evening were:\nMrs. P. B. Ellis, giving her impres\nsions of the Biennial held in New\nYork last May; Mrs. E. B. Yering\nton, on the work of the Parents\' and\nTeachers\' associations of the state;\nMiss, Vanderlieth. Student Loan\nwork; Miss Crisler, the work accom\nplished at the Federation held last\nweek in Goldfield, and Governor\nBoyle on legislation to be taken up\nat the coming session of the legisla\nfure. Three measures he recom\nmended to the attention of women:\nFirst, a measure recommended by\nGovernor Oddie and later by him\nself a non-partisan board to have\ncharge of the charitable and penal in\nstitutions of the state; second, the\nA Vote for Constitutional\nAmeedmeet Number 2\nIS A VOTE FOR GOOD ROADS\nThere will be voted upon at the coming general election an amendment (o lhe\nConstitution of the State of Nevada, which proposes to increase the borrowing power\nof the State from $300,000 to one per cent of its assessed valuation.\nAt the last session of Congress the sum of $75,000,000 was appropriated for\nthe construction of good roads in the United States, and of this sum nearly $1,000,\n000 was appropriated to the State of Nevada.\nTo obtain this appropriation it will be necessary for the State of Nevada to\ncreate a State Highway Fund, and with its present limited borrowing power the. State\nis absolutely unable to create such a fund and so obtain this money.\nIf this amendment is carried in the coming election the legislature will be asked\nto create a Highway Fund, which will be distributed among the various counties in\nsuch proportions as the legislature may prescribe, supplementing such funds as the\ncounties will expend for road construction, the total amounts thus expended by\nthe State of Nevada and its various counties will enable Nevada to secure this gov\nernment appropriation of $1,000,000.\nThis proposed amendment is one of the most constructive ever submitted to the\npeople of this State. In the excitement of the general election its value and impor\ntance is overlooked.\nW urge all good citizens to give their enthusiastic support to this amendment\nwhich means so much to the development and prosperity of every section of Nevada.\nNEVADA GOOD ROADS CLUB.\nVote "YES" for Amendment No. 2\nenlarging and defining of the duties\nof the State Board of Health, and\nthird, the finances of the state.\n-Miss Gladys Wood, Miss Mamie\nBerning and Mrs. Ben W.
