Cassei\nm ° n Railroad 3 Co-operating With tho Farmer\nCo-operation is a theme that lends itself most readily\n(HBlpk\'Sl* Mm* to theory but yields stubbornly to praettot. It is easy to\ndB^T. i:.Wy speak the wgird but difficult to understand It and more\n> difficult still to practice It. All can be selflsb but It takes\nvision to be progressive. The organized farmer has been\n9 preaching co-operation for lo! these many years, but now\nI come the railroads talking co-operation In the language\nI ot tee soil.\na recent paper read by G. G. Cassei, publicity agent\ntee Norfolk &. Western railway, is so full of horse sense\nteat w reproduce It In part and urge the farmers along\nthat roadway to continued cooperation with the manage\n\' " 3 ment of the road in all problems of mutual interest:\n"We are now dealing with two of the most gigantic occupations of men—\nfarming and land transportation. They are the basis of pretty nearly all\nwealth. When they fall the whole country fails. Therefore, how Important\nIt is that these two should fully understand each other, and work together\nnot only for their own commercial advancement but for the prosperity ot the\nnation.\n"The farmers and the railways are natural allies In all their Interests.\nIt is difficult to conceive of greater service to the commonwealth than that\nof firmly fixing in the minds of both the railways and the fanners that they\nare mutually dependent and that the prosperity of one depends on the pros\nperity of the other, but that suspicion and misunderstanding destroy the\ntarlous Interests of both. Many of the most progressive und far-seeing rail\nways have fully recognized this relation and dependence.\n"In the study of economic conditions In all branches of human endeavor,\nfrom the birth of our nation down to within quite recent years, we are aston\nished at the utter lack of the co-operative principle—the \'work together’\nidea—and not only that, but extreme selfishness and purblind prejudice has\nmore apparently dominated in the different blanches of trade and other ave\nnues of enterprise. This was a condition that government could not remedy.\nNo statute law. or even written constitution, can do more than safeguard\nthose Inalienable rights of the individual.\n"The mutual advantages of co-operation and sympathetic understanding\nare many and varied for both the railway and the farmer. The farmer Is\npeculiarly dependent upon rapid ana cheap transportation. His products\nare always comparatively bulky and frequently perishable. The railways\ngive farmers a worldwide market for their products. An Intelligent under\nstanding of the fundamental Improvement of railway transportation is essen\ntial to the prosperity of any agricultural community. Worldwide and nation\nwide markets are made possible only by regular and cheap transportation\nsuch as is offered by tho railways.\n"So the farmer may conclude that when he co-operates with the railroads,\nbis most potent allies, he is doing good for himself and much good for bis\ncountry\n“ ‘While there’re leaves in the forest and foam on th* river,’\nThe farmers and railways shall flourish forever. H\nOUR PUBLIC FORUM\nR. P. Schwerin\nt” On the Seamen’s Bill\nThe American plowmen are Interested In sea com\nmerce. It is expensive and likewise humiliating to have\nto salute a foreign flag every time a farmer wants to ship\na bushel of wheat, a bale of cotton or a pound of farm\nproducts across the ocean. Tho American farmer Is en\ntitled to the protection of his flag In sending his products\nacross the sea, and Congress should give such encourage\nment to shipping interests as Is necessary to meet foreign\nv competition In ocean commerce. A recent bill known as\nthe Seaman s Bill became a law under the President\'s\nsl * na,u re and Mr. R. P. Schwerin, vice-president of the\nf’ a< ’ ,flc Mi *il Steamship Company, when asked to define\ntel* law and outline Its effect upon American steamship\n" \' lines, said In part:\n"The bill provides that no ship of any nationality ’shall be permitted to\ndepart from any port of the United States unless she has on hoard a crew\nnot less than seventy-five per centum of which, in each department thereof,\nIs able to understand any order given by the officers of such vessel, nor\nunless forty per centum In the first year, forty-five per centum In the second\nyear, fifty |)er centum In the third year, fifty-five per centum in the fourth\nyear after the passage of this Act, and, thereafter sixty five per centum of her\ndeck crew, exclusive of licensed officers and apprentices, are of a rating not\nless ban able seamen.’\n“The oversea trade of the world Is competitive, therefore the original\ncost of the ship and the operation of the ship have to he reckoned with In\nthe keen competition of these rival nations with one another. The Oriental\nsailor is obedient and competent and Is the cheapest sailor In the world.\nIt Is therefore manifestly clear that If this law applied to all nationalities\nIn the transpacific traffic, all would be on the same economic basis, but It\nworks a single hardship to all the ships of the world, except the Japanese\nand American ships, and with the latter It works two hardships. With the\nEuropean, the cost of constructing a ship Is no higher than the cost of con\nstructing a Japanese ship, but If they had to provide European crews, while\nthe Japanese operated with Japanese crews, the condition of competition\nwould be such that they could not overcome the handicap and they would be\ndriven off. But the American ship would have to contend not only with the\ntremendous Increase of cost of wage in the substitution of the European crew\nfor the Chinese crew, but also the greater Initial cost of the ship. As the\nJapanese have now done away with their European officers and Japanese\ncrews, all of whom speak a common language, there Is no difficulty for them\nto comply with all the conditions of the bill and continue their Japanese\ncrews, with Oriental wages.\n“The law, therefore. Instead of assisting the American ship, adds another\nheavy burden, while It places none whatever upon the Japanese ship, but, on\nthe contrary, turns over to the Japanese the traffic of the Pacific Ocean,\nwhich the American ship is forced to forego by act of Congress of tbs\nUnited States."\nOUR PUBLIC FORUM\nPeter Radford\nOn Church and State\nThe recent action of one of the leading churches of\nthis nation, In annual convention, demanding that tho\nJB&SS| laymen vote only for candidates for office whose views\n188 coincide with those of the clergy on one of tho leading\npolitical Issues, and direct and indirect efforts of other\nchurch organizations to Interfere with the freedom of\ntho ballot, make one of the greatest perils of this age, and\npresent a problem that should receive thoughtful con\n/t®slderation of both laymen and citizens.\n"‘ flB Suckling babes may well squirm In their cradles\nwhen ministers in convention assembled release the\nnIE JSfIH hearts of men and grab them by the throat, for Chrls\n-lim JHqj tlanlty has broken down, religion has become a farce and\nthe pulpit a failure. When the church substitutes force\nfor persuasion, command for conviction and coercion for reason, the sheriff\nhad as well pass the sacrament, plain-clothes men take charge of the altar\nand policemen bury the dead, fo* why a church?\nIt Is as dastardly a crime against government for a minister to under\ntake to deliver the votes of his parishioners to a candidate, ss It Is for a\nward heeler to deliver a block of votes to a political boss, and both ought\nto be prosecuted, for the law should be no respecter of persons.\nIt is as objectionable for a convention of ministers to seek by canonical\nlaw to control the votes of church members as It would be for a convention\nof manufacturers to Issue orders for their employees to vote for a certain\ncandidate. Such conduct Is offensive to decency, business morals and a crime\nagainst society. Any convention, whether composed of saints or sinners,\nrich or poor, white or black, that seeks to prostitute power and coerce con\nscience ought to be broken up by the police and its leaders arrested for\ntreason.\nA crime by any other name lea crime Just the same. An ecclesiastical\nrobe cannot sanctify treason, authority to preach does not carry with It\nlicense to become a political rlngster, or the right to teach us how to pray\ngive a permit to tell us how to vote. No man In Joining the church should\nsacrifice his citizenship, forfeit his constitutional liberties or subordinate hie\nduty to the state. The earth many times has been drenched with the blood\not our forefathers fighting to throw off the ecclesiastical yoke from the state,\nand the suggestion of a return to these medieval conditions with their horror\nand their torture should not be tolerated for a moment.\nLawe should be psssed prohibiting any preacher, or combination of\npreachers, from delivering or attempting to deliver their membership or\ncongregation to any candidate for office, and suitable legislation should be\npassed preserving the sanctity of the pulpit from political vandalism. It Is\nas much a menace to church and state for a politician to occupy the pulpit\nas for a minister to preach s political sermon. He has no more right to\npreach his politics from the pulpit than a teacher has to teach his politics\nto his pupils. A preacher cannot make political trickery righteous by usage\nany more than he can make profanity respectable by practice. It is one\nof the ironies of fate that a preacher may become a scandal aa wall as a\nglory to civilisation.\nTHURMONT, FREDERICK COUNTY, MD\nA Family Newspaper—lndependent in Politics—Devoted to Literature. Local and General News.\nTHE MATCHMAKERS\nBy KEITH KENYON.\n“Well, I’m here!” called a gay young\nvoice just outside the door.\nThe three elderly bachelors turned\nfrom the breakfast table and viewed\nwith amazement a very pretty young\nperson who now stood in the doorway\nregarding them with a pair of wonder\nful violet eyes.\n“Well, uncles dear,” she pouted,\n"I’m homesick already! Not one of\nyou seems to be glad to see me; and\nI’ve traveled miles just to be with\nyou.” Tears appeared In the violet\neyes.\n"Why—why—why!" faltered Uncle\nAnthony, jumping from his chair and\nmoving toward the newcomer with\noutstretched hands. “We are de\nlighted, my dear—only you did sur\nprise us. I only received your moth\ner’s letter an hour ago.”\n“I suppose father forgot to mall It.\nIt was written a week ago and I—we1 —we\nall wondered why you didn’t answer.\nI told them I supposed you were so\nparalyzed with joy at my coming that\nyou simply couldn’t reply. Well, here\n1 am. Now, what are you going to do\nwith me?" She regarded them whim\nsically.\n"First have some breakfast," Invited\nUncle David, pecking a kiss at her\ncheek.\nUncle Benjamin rang for Mrs. Muf\nfet, whose disapproving expression\ndid not dissolve even beneath tho\nwarmth of Helena’s dazzling smile.\n"Another plate, please, Mrs. Muf\nfet,” directed Uncle Anthony. -"Will\nyou have a chop, Helena, my dear?”\n"If you please, uncle—oh, dear, It’s\nno wonder 1 can’t tell you apart when\nI haven’t seen you In dozens and doz\nens of years!”\n“Not since you were five, Helena,”\ncorrected Uncle David gravely. “And\nyou must be —let me see; why, bless\nme, child, you are seventeen!”\n“I’m as old as I look—or us young,\nuncles dear —only tell me, please,\nwhich one cf you Is which?”\nThen Helena Strang was properly\nIntroduced to her three charmiug\n"Well, I’m Here,’’ Called a Gay Young\nVoice.\ngranduncles, who proceeded to enjoy\nher youthful enthusiasm to the ut\nmost.\nUncle Anthony loved to recite his\nfavorite poems to Helena, and in hei\nhe found a gentle, appreciative lis\ntener. Uncle David challenged her to\na nightly game of chess and was\nhighly delighted when she vanquished\nhim, as she frequently did. It was\nUncle Benjamin who was the sports\nman of the family, and together he\nand Helena drove each day to the\ncountry club and tramped over the\ngolf course, •becoming, In due time,\ndelightfully chummy.\nThen the three old gentlemen con\nceived a plot to marry Helena to one\nof their neighbors, Jack Lyman, an\naltogether desirable young man who,\non his part, lost no time in falling In\nlove with the fascinating grand\nniece.\nit was about this time that a re\nmarkable change took place In Helena.\nSomething seemed to have dampened\nher high spirits, and she went about\nwith a depressed and half-frightened\nlook on her charming face. All tho\ngranduncles noticed it, and, finally,\nMrs. Muffet was called In consultation.\n"I might classify her disease as a\nguilty conclence,” Mrs. Muffet diag\nnosticated, with a sour smile.\n“Mrs, Muffet!” reared the three old\ngentlemen In chorus. Then Uncle An\nthony arose In his most dignified man\nner and Informed his housekeeper\nthat if she would step Into the library\nhe would pay her up to the first of\nthe year and that Amos would drive\nher to the station at once.\n‘Til go,” said Mrs. Muffet angrily,\n“but before I do leave I’d like to ask\none question—how Is It that Miss\nHelena came here twelve years ago\nwith a pair of beautiful brown eyes—\nand now her eyes are Hue —blue as\nviolets?”\nThe trio of uncles gasped.\n“Fiddlesticks!" ejaculated Uncle\nBenjamin, first to recover.\n“They are very blue Indeed,” mur\nmured Uncle Anthony, tenderly.\n“I’ve heard that the eyes of Infants\nfrequently do assume another color In\nafter years,” defended Uncle David.\n"Miss Helena was no Infant when\nshe came here before, air," returned\n, THURSDAY, AU\nMrs, Mullet grimly. “She was five\nyears old, for I was chambermaid then\nand I took care of her. Her eyes were\nbrown like her mother’s and her hair\nwas the same color—and she gave no\npromise of looking like this one. If\nyou’ll excuse my saying so, she\ncouldn’t be as handsome!”\n"Then—then, who Is our Helena?”\ndemanded Uncle David fiercely.\n“An Impostor!”\n"Absurd!" almost shrieked the three\nuncles In concert, and Mrs. Muffet\nwas allowed to depart under suspend\ned sentence of dismissal until they\ncould investigate the case of the\nniece whose relationship to them she\nhad so bcldly questioned.\n“What shall we do?” asked Uncle\nAnthony, feebly, when they were alone.\n“Let us get the truth," said Uncle\nBenjamin firmly.\nSo they went In a body into the\ngarden on their distasteful errand.\nThey came upon her suddenly at\nthe turn ota corner arbor. Jack Ly\nman was with her, and what the\nwould-be Inquisitors saw made them\nforget their errand.\nThe young people did not see the\nthree anxious old faces —they were\ntoo deeply absorbed In the telling ot\na wonderful story whose sotting\nshould always be in a rose garden.\nGuiltily the granduncles tiptoed\nback to the house. "I will wire the\nnews to Isabel and ask their con\nsent," whispered Unde Anthony.\nAt which his brothers blushed rosy\nred, for they knew that meant a\nspeedy solution of the problem. It\nwould soon be known to them whether\nthey had indeed been entertaining\nthdr grandniece or an Impostor, as\nMrs. Muffet had charged.\n“She Is a dear child, anyway,” de\nclared Uncle David gruffly, and the\nothers nodded assent.\nUncle Anthony scratched off a tele\ngram, of which the others approved:\n"Helena Is quite well and wants\nyour consent to her engagement to\nJack Lyman, our particular friend.”\n"We should receive a reply by din\nner time,” said David as he prepared\nto take the telegram to the station.\nHelena did not make her appear\nance until half an hour before dinner.\nShe pleaded a headache, and she\nlooked quite pale and drooping when\nshe earne down stairs and Joined the\nwaiting trio on the veranda.\nMrs, Strang’s telegram arrived al\nmost precisely at the same moment.\nUncle Anthony opened it with shak\ning fingers and road:\n"Are you crazy? Helena is with\nme and ill with whooping cough, an\nabsurd ailment for a girl of seven\nteen, Will write. Isabel.”\nWithout a word the distressed old\nman passed the message to David,\nwho read it in grim silence and then\nhanded it to Benjamin.\nHelena stood before them, her eyes\nlooking like drowned blue violets In\nher pale face.\n"I have something to tell you, all,”\nshe began with a catch in her voice.\n"1 have told Mr. Lyman—Jack—and\nhe has forgiven me. 1 hope you will,\ntoo, for 1 love you all so dearly!”\n“What ts It. my dear?” asked Uncle\nAnthony compassionately.\nHelena slipped to her knees and\nhid her face in his lap.\n“I am not Helena Strang,” she con\nfessed tearfully. “I am quite an\nother Helena—Helena Clifton. I\nhave been Mrs. Strang’s private secre\ntary for several years—l am twenty\nfour. I never had a home. I was\nbrought up In an orphan asylum and\nwhen I was old enough to go out Into\ntho world I found a place In a store\nand worked until I could save money\nenough to take a business course;\nwhen I was competent Mrs. Strang\nemployed me.\n“When she decided to go to Mon\ntreal she gave mo six months’ vaca\ntion —and I had nowhere to go.\nThere had been much talk of Helen\ncoming down to her uncles and it\nwas all arranged, but at the last mo\nment she decided to go to Canada\nwith her parents. Before she went,\nshe proposed this scheme to me and\ninglsted that I should Impersonate\nher as your grandniece.\n“It was a great temptation to me to\ncome down here—and—so I came.\nYou know the. rest—and If you want\nto send for the police, you may! But\nyou havo been wonderfully kind to\nme and I don’t believe Helena Strang\ncould love you more than I do! So\nthere!”\nShe rose and faced them with tear\nful eyes and trembling lips.\n“Dear me!” coughed Uncle An\nthony, looking properly distressed.\n“Humph—nonsense!” growled Uncle\nDavid. “A man may have more than\none grandniece, eh, boys? Well, Hel\nena Clifton, I’ll adopt you aa my niece\nhere and now! I like you.” He held\nout hla arms and Helena promptly ac\ncepted their protection.\n“It’s my turn now,” reminded\nUncle Benjamin, rather Jealously.\nAfter Helena had cried a little on\neach kindly shoulder, and still\nblushing divinely, and with a pathetic\nquaver In her voice, she resumed: “I\nhave promised to marry Jack Lyman,\nuncles. I told him all about it and he\nsaid It didn’t matter in the least, so\nwe are engaged—provided, of course,\nyou give your consent.”\nThe three old matchmakers looked\nvery uncertain Indeed, but while\nthey were pretending to consider\ntho serious question, their frowns\ngave way to delighted grins, for Jack\nLyman himself came striding up the\npath.\n“Here comes our prospective\nnephew-ln-law,” announced Uncle An\nthony cheerfully.\n(Copyright, 1915, by (he McClure Newspa\nper Syndicate.)\nChocolate was known to the Azteca\nof Mexico. -\nON.\nUST 19, 1915.\nFOREIGN ORDERS MEAN MUCH\nMay Bring Prosperity to Town In\nWhich Important Steel Works\nAre Located.\nMost of our steel works are located\noutside of tlie big centers of popula\ntion, and often the town near by Is\ncomposed entirely of men employed\nIn the steel works. When times are\ndull and the works are shut down this\ncommunity is very badly off; many\nmen do not have means of subsistence,\nand the storekeepers, although they\nmight be willing to advance credit to\ntheir customers, find that they them\nselves are out of funds. When the\nmill is running for only three days a\nweek, or perhaps is shut down a week\nor two weeks at a time, there will be\nknots of men standing on the street\ncorners. They are not the kind that\nwe know too well as loafers on our\ncity streets; they want to work, and\nwhen they see the manager go by will\nstop him and ask him what the pros\npects are, lie knows that many of\nthem have little in the house to eat.\nHe knows that they will not complain\nor bog. A foreign order will furnish\nwork for these men; it will give bread\nto their children—perhaps a little cake\nus well. Of course the manager will\nnot acknowledge that he is Influenced\nby this, for he must play the part of\na hard hearted master. The directors\nand stockholders expect him to make\njust as much profit as he can. and he\nmust keep in mind the main purpose\nfor which the plant exists. It was not\nbuilt to furnish bread to the hungry,\nto give work to the idle, or to make\nsteel. These are only incidents. The\nplant was built to make money, and\nthat he must constantly bear in mind,\nliut there are times when the man\nager, although he may not acknowl\nedge If, is really a bit human and does\ntake cognizance of the needs of his\nmen and the value to them of a for\neign order. —11. 11.

To\nthe lay mind silk would seem the best\nfitted for the purpose on account of\nits lightness and strength, but it has\nbeen found not to withstand exposure\nto sun and rain as well as could be\ndesired, and it does not lend Itself to\nthe application of the dressing com\npounds intended to shrink the cover\ning tautly over the frames, and render\nthe fabric proof against the weather.\nAs the result of experience it has\nbeen found that linen is the best ma\nterial thus far used, for, after it has\nreceived several coats of a solution of\ncasein—the substance generally used\nfor the purpose—the fabric Is found\nto be stretched as tightly as a drum\nhead, making a very smooth surface,\nwhich is of great advantage In fast\nflights.\nThe coating also Increases the\nstrength of the linen and renders It\nmore enduring under varying weather\nconditions. It Is estimated that such\na coating increases the strength of\nthe linen at least 5 per cent.\nImproper Suspenders.\nA surgeon lecturing to a class of\nhospital nurses in an English training\nschool recently conjured his hearers\nto persuade their fathers, brothers,\nhusbands or sweethearts to wear hy\ngienic suspenders.

These laws\nare said to have been committed to\nwriting in the fifth century, and al\nthough several Latin texts exist, con\nsiderable obscurity rests over their\nhistory. The law relates principally\nto the compensation and punishment\nof crimes, and there is a chapter con\ntaining provisions regarding succes\nsion to what are called Salic lands.

He con\ngratulated himself on his Investment.\nHis success was pleasing. His brisk\ngenial ways made friends for him on\nevery side. Within a few weeks ho\nhad got to love his work. He felt like\na new man, for early hours and tem\nperate habits were making that of\nhim.\nThe expected summons came for\nNed and Watson, one day. They had\nmissed Tom sorely. Life was becom\ning dull to them.\n“Tom writes that he can fit us in\nadmirably,” Watson announced to Ned.\n“What am I expected to do?” in\nquired Watson.\n“Take the business management of\nthe Monitor. You are to see that it\ngets advertising and subscriptions.\nYou\'re a good mixer. After a spell\nyou will be eligible for a local office.\nTime will promote you: village clerk,\nmayor, legislature, congress, and so\non!”\n“H\'m!” reflected Watson — “that\nisn\'t so bad. I’m willing to enlist.”\nSo, one day Watson and Ned ar\nrived in Ferndale. The latter set up\nan office as a lawyer. The former, in\ncidentally, was secured as a working\npartner by Tom. The columns of the\nMonitor gave them a splendid send\noff. Each week thereafter there came\ndue publicity.\nThe village was isolated from rail\nconnections. Two lines ran twenty\nmiles apart and each ten miles from\nFerndale. The Monitor began to speak\nof an electric line, a gas works, a new\nwater system and other improver tents.\nNed began to experience the thrill\nand revenue of having real clients.\nWatson was entranced with the va\nriety of acting as a reporter. Work\non the Monitor began to tell. One\nday Watson rushed into the news\npaper office aflame with some new and\nexciting information.\n“I’ve struck it, fellows!” he an\nnounced with a triumphant chuckle.\n“Struck what?” queried Ned and\nTom in a breath.\n“My level. My engineering ability\nhas come to the front at last. What\ndo you think: looking up particulars\nas to the fall crops, I came across a\nfine old place outside the town here\nowned by Colonel Huntington.”\n“I’ve heard of him. Sort of an aris\ntocrat, isn’t he?” questioned Ned.\n“He’s a fine old gentleman, wit!, a\nhobby—to connect Ferndale with one\nof the two railroads. He tried the\nscheme two years ago, has the right\nof-way, Invested one hundred thousand\ndollars and stopped work because he\ncould get no co-operation or encour\nagement. The minute he talked do*\ntails I saw my chance.”\n“What to do?” asked Ned.\n“Carry the scheme through tor him.\nAs a practical engineer, I think I see\nmy way clear. And say, talking of\nus, ‘the three B’s,‘ what do you think?”\nwent on the volatile Watson. The\nColonel has three daughters, and they\nare ‘B’s,’ too —Bertha, Beatrice,\nBlanche. Fellows, I never saw such\nloveliness!”\nWithin a month Ferndale was elec\ntrified. Smart, able Watson Bross\nhad played the two steam roads one\nagainst the other as to the proposed\nconnection with Ferndale. Ho bar\ngained so well that the Northern Una\nagreed to pay half the construction\ncost.\nFerndale awoke from Its lethargy.\nBusiness began to hum with the com\npletion of the new spur, of which Wat\nson Bross became chief engineer.\nAnd then came a natural and happy\nmating. Three bright, pretty girls,\nthree brisk, handsome young men.\nThere was no clash. Wateon took to\nBertha from the first. Ned was at\ntracted by Blanche the moment he set\neyes upon her. Watson found an\nagreeable companion In Beatrice.\nThere was a great celebration at\nFerndale the day that Ned Burton was\nelected Its mayor. It was made more\nthan attractive by the fact that a\ntriple wedding ran current with tho\nevent.', '(Jatoctln Qurion.\nPikllikedertrr Thrsdayt Thurmont\nMd. , fcy The CUriou PMUhlaCo.\nJ AS. U.

AUGUST 19, 1915.\nOn Lincoln Highway.\nRoutes Selected Last Week By\nOfficials.\nSeveral weeks ago it was reported\nthat the Lincoln Highway route from\nNew York to San Francisco was about\nto be changed. In the Baltimore\ndailies of Friday last, it was announc\ned that the route had been decided\nupon definitely, and that a branch of\nthe road would pass, through Mary\nland. The following letter was pub\nlished in the Baltimore American:\n“Washington, D. C., August 12 —\nChairman Weller, of the Maryland\nState Roads Commission, and a mini\nler of Baltimoreans who are mem\nbers of the Maryland Branch of the\nNational Lincoln Memorial Highway\nAssociation met memliers of the\nWashington branch of that associa\ntion at a conference held today at\nthe Chamber of Commerce. The prin\ncipal business of the meeting was to\ndecide upon the route which the high\nway will take through Maryland.\nChairman Weller laid before the con\nference the route for Maryland.\n“The Lincoln memorial is to ex\ntend from New York to San Francis\nco. At Philadelphia two roads may\nle taken to reach Gettysburg. One\nOne is direct and the other is a de\ntour which takes in Baltimore and\nWashington. This plan has been de\ncided upon in order that the highway\nmay pass the $15,000,(XX) Lincoln\nMemorial now under the course of\nconstruction in this city.\n“The distance from New York to\nthe point where the highway enters\nMaryland is about 148 miles, Mr.\nWeller said. The route will pass\nthrough Elkton, Havre de Grace and\nBelair to Baltimore. From there it\nwill follow the Washington boulevard\nto this city, it is planned to have\nthe route come into the city proper\nat Fifteenth and H streets northeast,\nor via Rhode Island avenue and ex\ntend through the city, encircling the\nLincoln Memorial in Potomac Park.\nIt will then extend through the\nnorthwest section of the city and\nprobably will follow Massachusetts\navenue to Wisconsin avenue. The\nmute from that point will lie to Rock\nville, Gaithersburg, Ridgeville, Fred\nerick, Thurmont, Emmitshurg and\nthence to Gettysburg. All the Mary\nland roads, Mr. Weller reported, are\nin excellent condition.\n“A piece of roadway less than six\nmiles long extending from the Mary\nland line to Gettysburg has not been\nimproved, and efforts are being made\nto get the Pennsylvania road author\nities to see that this is put in first\nclass condition.\nThe detour route Is to lie marked\nat frequent intervals with red, white\nand red signs. Red, white and blue\nsigns are to mark the main highway.\nIt was stated at the meeting that the\nMaryland Automobile Club is to stand\nthe expense of manufacturing, erect\nand maintaining the signs.\nGEORGE STOUFFEK DAAI).\nOn Saturday, August 14th, 1915, Mr.\nGeorge A. Stouffer, of Washington, D.\nC., died at the home of Mr. and Mrs.\nChas. J. Weller in Thurmont. Mr. Stouf\nfer has been in bad health for some\nmonths and came to the country hoping\nto be benefitted. His illness was due to\nBright’s disease.\nMr. Stouffer was a brother-in-law to\nMrs. M. A. Williar, his wife being Miss\nAgnes Weller and a sister of the late\nSimon Weller\nFuneral services were held at the home\nof Mr. Weller on Monday afternoon at\n3 o’clock, and interment made in the U.\nB. cemetery. The deceased is survived\nby one son, Mark, and one daughter,\nMrs. Lillie Pollock, of Washington. He\nwas aged 76 years, 10 months and 24\ndays.\nMr. Stouffer was born near Thurmont\nand was one of a large family of children.\nDuring the Civil War he enlisted in the\ncause of the Union August 18, 1862, be\ning a member of Company H., Ist Regi\nment Infantry, Maryland Volunteers.\nThis company was in command of Capt.\nB. H. Schley, of Frederick, who was a\nfirst cousin to the late Admiral Schley.\nGeneral John R. Kenly was the first Col\nonel of this regiment. Eight officers, in\ncluding three colonels, and 168 non-com\nmissioned officers and privates were\nkilled in battle.

They seemingly overlook this im\nportant fact in the carrying on of their\ncampaign, and are foolish enough to ex\npect that the sensible Republican voters\nof the county are going to give this im\nportant office to a Democratic District\nwhile the loyal Republican Districts go\nbegging for Republican nominations.\nThis they will never do. They can be\nrelied on to cast their ballots in the inter\nests of their own party and not in the in\nterest of the Democrats.\nSeveral weeks ago we showed you by\nmeans of statistics that Emmitsburg,\nMr. Patterson’s District, always gives\nan overwhelming Democratic majority.\nThen the next week we proved to you by\nthe same means that Woodsboro, Mr.\nHoffman’s District likewise was strongly\nDemocratic, Since then we have hoard\nveiled hints that Balienger District could\nnot be shown up and therefore we had\nleft it alone. Not so, Mr. Voter, we as\nsure you. The reason and the only rea\nson why we did not follow the unmasking\nof Emmitsburg and Woodsboro districts\nby a similar revelation concerning Bullen\nger district, was because we hud not the\nstatistics at hand, and we were unwilling\nto go adead with any denunciation of Mr.\nMorsell’s candidacy until we were certain\nthat neither he nor the district deserved\nit. We have the means now, however,\nof proving this to you, Mr. Voter, and\nwe shall give you nothing but facts and\nfigures, as has been our custom in deal\ning with the other two dist.icts.\nI M\n■ V\nDr. Austin A. Lamar.\nWe shall start seven years ago with\nthe election of 1909. In that year Ball\nenger gave 16 majority to the Democrats\nwhile Middletown rolled up 169 for the\nRepublicans. The next year, 1910, saw\npractically the same kind of a vote, for\nBalienger went Democratic by 18 and\nMiddletown gave the Republicans 156.\nBut Balienger is leaning more and more\ntoward the Democrats every year, and\nin 1911 gave them 28 as compared with\nMiddletown’s Republican majority of 167.\nIn 1912 the vote in Balienger was split\nup as follows: Democrats 97, Republi\ncans 35, Progressives 20; practically a\nDemocratic majority of 42, if you con\nsider that the Progressive vote came\nfrom the Republican party which is an\nestablished fact. Middletown’s vote in\nthe same year was Progressives 171, Re\npublicans 132, Democrats 167; if consid\nered in like manner a Republican major\nity of 136. In the past two years, 1913\nand 1914, Balienger gave respective ma\njorities of 65 and 42 to the Democrats\nwhile Middletown’s Republican majori\nties were 113 and 114, respectively. Now\nMr. Republican Voter, which of these\ntwo Districts do you think deserves your\nsupport, Balienger or Middletown? Think\nit over seriously. Moreover, Mr. Morsel),\nBallenger’s candidate, is a member of\nthe County School Board, a political ap\npointment, \'and therefore deserves no\nmore at the hands of the people, while\nDr. Lamar, the candidate from Middle\ntown District, has never had a political\nappointment, notwithstanding that he\nhas been a loyal Republican worker ever\nsince he reached his majority.\n—Published by authority of\nAdvertising Manager.\nLoys Letter.\nMrs. Baltzell and Mrs. Creeger of\nThurmont spent Saturday with Mrs. Wm.\nShort and family.\nMiss Bessie Arnold of Rocky Hill spent\nSunday with Mrs. Mary Colbert.\nMr. Clarence Pittenger of Pleasant\nHill spent Sunday with his parents.\nQuite a number of our people attended\nthe picnic at Rocky Ridge on Saturday.\nWho Sent The Poem?\nLast week a poet broke loose some\nwhere, wrote and sent us a lengthy poem\nbut failed to put his signature after the\nlast stanza.

Because of the durability of the utensils-truly the ware eternal.\n111. Because they are sanitary and hygenic-endorsed by physicians\nand boards of health.\n“During a recent investigation at Lancet laboratory at London, England, learned scientists experiment\ned with the various types of cooking ware and the possible reactions that resulted, and concluded after a series\nof tests that copper, lead, granite and enamel utensils were unsuitable for cooking purposes and unanimously\nendorsed the aluminum ware.” —American Medical Journal.\nIV. Because they are cleanly and easy to clean-a delight to the eye\nin the kitchen.\nV. Because of their high conductivity of heat and the uniformity\nof distribution they enable one to cook the most delicate food\nwithout danger of burning.\nVI. For the same reason they are time savers and fuel economizers.\nVII. Because they are the last word in cooking ware, combining all\nthe necessary functions of the ideal utensils=-sanitation, dura=\nbility, economy.\nWe take great pleasure in announcing to the people of Thurmont\nand surrounding that we have made arrangements to completely\nequip your kitchen with this ware\nWITHOUT COST TO YOU!\nWe will be very glad for you to come and see some of these uten=\nsils and let us tell you of our plan.\nRob’t A. Tyson & Co.,\nA COMPLETE LINE OF GROCERIES.\nTHURMONT, MD.\nWIN FOUR OUT OF FIVE.\nTliurniont Puts Another (iame\nOn Ice And Win Series.\nThe fifth game of ball between Thur\nmont and Emmitsburg clubs was played\non the local grounds Monday of this week\nand for thrillers it surpassed all others.\nArnold was on the hill for the visitors\nand held the locals scoreless until the\nfifth when one run was pushed over the\nplate. This run, however, tied the score\nEmmitsburg scoring a run in the third\ndue to an error.\nAt the beginning of the sixth Arnold\nretired for some reason, and Rosensteel\nwas put in to pitch. Here the fun be\ngan. “Chick” had no control, was easy\nto hit, and at the close of the inning five\nruns had been chalked up by the score\nkeepers and a padlock put on the game\nand series by manager Brennaman. At\nthe beginning of the seventh Stokes re\nlieved Rosensteel but the batting fever\nclung to the local lads and three more\nruns were made making the score 9 to 2.\nIn the eighth and ninth neither side made\na gain.\nEddie Creeger who shut the visitors\nout on their previous visit here, was on\nthe mound and but for errors would have\nsent them away again empty. The field\ning on both sides was generally fast,\nRoot for Thurmont distinguishing him\nself by bringing down high fly ball which\nordinarily would have gone for two-base\nhits.\nWhile running to first base to judge a\nclose decision, Umpire Thompson twisted\nhis right ankle, the pain causing him to\ncall time. Dr. Jamison of Emmitsburg\nadministered a little painkiller and adhe\nsive gauze and the game proceeded.\nCatcher Sebold received one of Stokes’\nshoots on the end of one of his convales\ncent fingers, giving it a relapse and need\nof Dr. Jamison’s service.\nStokes apparently attempted to deliv\ner a ball in Birely’s left hip pocket, but\nthere was no pocket there. Birely knew\nthe ball had been there. No physician\nwas needed.\nEmmitsburg.\nab r h o A E\nE. Annan lb, 5 1 0 10 0 1\nS. Annan If 5 1 2 3 0 0\nW.

Thurmont had failed to tally in\ntheir half of the first, but broke into the\nrun column in the second with two marks,\nwhich feat they repeated in the third.\nIn the fourth, fifth and sixth frames the\nvisitors drew blanks, Arnold allowing\nbut three men an inning to bat. They\ngot a man on first on an error in the\nfourth, but after L. Birely flied out to\nsecond, Damuth hit into a double play\nover the Hospelhorn—G.

Rosensteel here took up the\nreins with the score 10 to 5 in favor of\nEmmitsburg. The first ball he threw\nwas low and got past Stokes, another\nrun scoring. Freeze then sacrificed a\nthird tally on a fly to Topper in right, V.\nBirely fanned and J. Creeger sent an\nother high one to right for the third out.\nA base on balls and a hit gave Thurmont\ntheir final count in the eighth.\n“Eddie Creeger relieved Root at the\nopening of the sixth inning and held his\nopponents hitless and scoreless the re\nl maining innings.”\nj Had the Thurmont lineup been the\nsame in this game as that,of Monday of\nthis week, results might have been dif\nferent.\nEmmitsburg.\nAB R H O A E\nE.

It seems incon\nceivable that a party of slightly more\nHan a score of men could journey for\nSpurs across the State, attack the State\nBrison, overpower the guards, capture a\nBirisoner and carry him 140 miles to a\ndesignated spot, and there at day break\n[execute the death penalty with all the\ngrim deliberation and much of the ter\nrible panoply of judicial procedure.\nWherever the mob originated, if it\ncame from one section, the utmost cau\ntion was observed. Everything was\ntimed with wonderful accuracy. The\nleader waited until everyone who lived\nat the prison would be asleep, but he\nleft time enough to run the 140 miles to\nCobb county before daylight.\nShortly after 10 o’clock J. R. Smith,\nwarden, was awakened in his home at\nthe edge of the farm grounds. There\nwas an insistent rapping at his door. He\nopened it.\nRevolvers instantly were thrust in his\nface.\n“If you make a noise you’re a dead\nman,” he was assured.\nThe warden did not make a noise. He\nwas handcuffed. His keys were taken.\nIn similar fashion and with speed and\nprecision—indicating thorough knowl\nedge of the prison grounds -Superintend\nent Burke was captured at his home.\nThen the three guards in the prison office\nwere overpowered and secured, the lead\ners of the mob using their keys and\nknowledge of the prison with remarkable\nassurance.\nFrank slept in a room adjoining the\noffice, and it seems the mob leaders knew\nthat, too. The next move was upon him.\nFrank’s body was found hanging from\na tree 140 miles from the prison Tuesday\nmorning. Life was extinct but a short\ntime.\nWill (loveriimen l He|*Hir Its Part Of\nState Road ?\n“With the State road gangs at work\nrepairing roads leading to Gettysburg,\ncomes the probability that between the\nstretches that the State puts in good\ncondition and the roads under the control\nof the National Park Commission, will\nbe bad pieces of highway, since the gov\nernment has yet shown no disposition to\nrepair these stretches under their juris\ndiction. These two portions of road in\nclude about a half mileon theTaneytown\nfrom Granite lane to the blacksmith shop\nat Round Top and 7,800 feet on the Em\nmitsburg road between the Peach Or\nchard road and a point near the Sixth\nPennsylvania monument.\n‘Under an act passed in 1905 the Com\nmonwealth of Pennsylvania ceded to the\nNational Park Commission jurisdiction\nover public roads and parts of public\nroads within the limits of the National\nPark here, and included in this act came\nthe portions of road referred to above.\nOn the Taneytown road the government\nhas built a macadam road as far as the\nGranite lane and on the highway to Em\nmitsburg as far as the Peach Orchard\nroad, leaving the portions of road be\ntween as provided in the act ceding the\nhighway to the government, unrepaired.\n—Gettysburg Star and Sentinel.\nUnion Meeting.\nThe Union Meetings continue to be\nlargely attended in spite of the warm\nweather.

You would not,\nhowever, if you should give them a trial.\nThey strengthen and invigorate the stom\n\' ach and enable it to perform its functions\nnaturally.

Sheriff Con\nc ard and four deputies came to Thurmont\nTuesday morning to pick up any persons\nt riding freight or other trains illegally,\ni During the forenoon these officers cap\nj tured an aged “traveler” at Hobo camp\nf west of Thurmont and brought him to\ni the W. M. depot, then waited for a\n1 freight train to come. One came at 2\nf o’clock; the officers having stationed\np themselves along the track west of the\n: depot. As the train came slowly to the\n: station two riders were discovered and\nthe riders discovered the officers.\nThese fellows, both young men, well\n• dressed, saw the officers to the right of\n■ the train and beat it to the other side to\nmake their escape. They jumped, but\nonly to be nabbed by another officer.\n• They were cuffed together and placed in\none of the automobiles under guard.\nAs the freight train was leaving Thur\n! mont, a negro who had been loafing\naround the freight yard jumped on the\ni train. The officers did not see him.\nSeveral of the officers then left for\nHobo camp to try and detect a visitor,\nwhile others waited for another train go\ning west.\nThe greater number of train riders\nseem to arrive at Thurmont during the\n, night, and many times remain here until\nthe next day. Citizens residing at the\ni east end of Thurmont are annoyed by\nthese people very much, as they come\nbegging for something to eat.\nBy persistent effort the railroad officials\nmay possibly break up the habit of steal\ning a ride on a freight train, but the\nask is no small one.\nIt might be well for some people east\nand west of Thurmont who occasionally\n■ ide freight trains to take notice.\nMt. St. Mary’s Items.\nSt. Anthony Club I’luy Two\nGames Last Week.\nTwo very interesting games of ball\nwere played last week by St. Anthony’s\nboys, one at Rocky Ridge, the other at\nDetour, and both on Saturday. The\ngame of s—l5 —1 played at Rocky Ridge in\nthe morning was a pitchers battle be\ntween W. Shorb and Leslie Fox, the lat\nter having the advantage of the six in\nning contest. True, he fanned 14 men\nand allowed but 6 hits, while Shorb fan\nned but 8 and allowed 5 hits. Until the\nfifth inning not a man reached second.\nIn this inning the locals scored their only\nrun. In the isixth the Ridge boys won\ntheir game, a base on balls, several er\nrors by Warthen at 3rd aided by several\nhits netted five runs, which won the con\ntest. A return game will be played on\nthe old field at the College along the State\nRoad Saturday at 4 p. m. The same\nteams will be on the field and the game\npromises to be very interesting.\nAs per agreement with the Ridge boys\nthe game was called at the end of the\nsixth, in order that St. Anthony could\nplay at Detour in the afternoon at 2.30.\nManager Seltzer put W. Shorb, who did\nthe pitching in the morning, in the box\nagainst the Detour boys, and finding he\ndid not have to work very hard, kept\nhim there the entire game. Shorb al\nlowed but 8 hits and no runs, while the\nDetour battery, Myers, Fogle and Ecker,\nwere handled for 23 hits and 22 runs.\nThe St. Anthony boys never played\nbetter ball than they did at Rocky Ridge\nSaturday morning. In conclusion we\nmust say that never have the local boy*\nbeen treated better than they were at\nRocky Ridge and Detour last Saturday.\nWe are only too sorry that our season is\nso near close that we cannot meet again.\nMr. and Mrs. Jas.

Anyone interested\nshould see the crop before it is cut.\nBumped Into Tree.\nTuesday, about noon, an automobile\ncame in collision with a tree in front of\nDr. Sefton’s residence, corner Carroll\nand E. Main streets. The car was being\ndriven by a lady, but those persons near\nby failed to recognize any of the occu\npants of the car. The tree was damaged\n1 considerably and the concrete gutter\nbroken. The car was not damaged.\nThe Case of L. L. Cantelou.\nThe case of L. L. Cantelou, Clarendon,\nr Texas, is similar to that of many others\nwho have used Chamberlain’s Colic,\nCholera and Diarrhoea Remedy.

The moth lays her eggs on\nthe outside of the vine, and in a few\ndays the eggs hatch into small grubs.\nThese Immediately bore their way\ninto the stalk where they live un\nseen and for a time unsuspected.\nFor a while the vines grow well;\nthen, as the borer continues feeding\non the inside of the stalk, the vine\nwithers and dies. Whole patches of\nsquash may be destroyed by these\nborers in a few days.\nIn 1914 one farmer made tests of\nearly and late planting The early\nplantings were begun in April and\ncontinued into May. Sweet corn was\nused as a companion crop, with the\nfearly plantings to furnish shade for\nthe squash vines, but every vine ex\ncept one was destroyed by the borers\nin all the early plantings.\nHe made late plantings of seed\nfrom June 1 to July 20, which was\nthe last planting of the season. In\norder to hasten the development of\nthe plants as an offset to late plant\ning, separate hills were prepared.\nHoles were dug from eight to ten\ninches deep, which were filled with\nrich soil thoroughly mixed with chick\nen manure, but he left saucer-like\ndepressions as an aid to watering\nthe plants in dry weather This plan\nproved very serviceable, as no rain\nfell during six weeks of midsummer.\nThe plants had to be watered fre\nquently to keep them vigorous.\nNotwithstanding the drawbacks of\nlate planting and a dry season, this\ncrop of Hubbards was among the best\nhe had ever raised. Hardly a vine\nwas attacked by the borers. The\nperiod of squash-moth flying was over\nbefore the plants were above ground.\nONIONS LIKE COOL WEATHER\nPlant Will Stand Much Heat After\nMaking Good Start—Will Not Keep\nUnlesa Properly Ripened.\nOnions grow best in relatively cool\nweather and require an abundance of\nmoisture during the early stages of\ngrowth. However, they will stand con\nsiderable heat after they have made\na good start, and ripen better if the\nweather is relatively dry at the time\nthey mature.\nThis makes them an important crop\nin central and northern latitudes,\nwhere the weather of spring is cool\nand moist, and a dry period normally\noccurs in August or In early Septem\nber. However, the season must be\nsufficiently long for the onions to ma\nture before the autumn rains set in,\nor they are likely never to ripen prop\nerly.\nUnless properly ripened, onions will\nnot keep. For northern localities it\nis sometimes necessary to use only\nthe earlier maturing varieties.\nThe above statements refer to the\ngrowing of ripe onions. Qreen onions\nreach edible size in a comparatively\nshort time, and can be grown during\nthe normally cool and moist weather\nof early spring in central and north\nern latitudes. As a commercial crop,\nthey are of minor importance com\npared with ripe onions.\nSILAGE CARRIER IS USEFUL\nLabor-Saving Device Can Be Used to\nGreat Advantage by Farmer When\nFeed la Not Too Large.\nIf you have put up a good strong\nsilo and your feed yard is not too\nlarge, you will find the silage dis\ntributer illustrated herewith a very\nuseful and labor-saving device. This\noverhead silage carrier is described\nin bulletin No. 145 issued from the\n5 j—E: ■. •. •\nNew Idea In Silage Carriers.\nNebraska experiment station. The\narm must be well guyed and strong\nly pivoted. The feed bunks are placed\nin the form of a semicircle so the\nsilage may be dumped directly into\nthem from the carrier, as the arm is\nswung around. Either hay carrier or\nlitter carrier track may be utilized for\nthis purpose.\nFEEDING THE YOUNG POULTS\nCoarsely Ground Corn Mlxsd With\nMilk Makes One of Best Feeds\nfor Young Fowls.\nOne of the best feeds for young\npoults is coarsely ground corn mixed\nwith either sweet or sour milk, or the\ncorn might be baked in a cake and\nthen moistened with milk before feed\ning.\nOne should determine as to whether\nhe wishes to use sweet or sour milk\nand then continue to use the kind de\ncided upon as it is not advisable to\nchange from one to the other.\nThis moistened ground corn is\ngradually mixed with corn meal until\nthey receive clear corn meal when\nthey are about eight weeks old.\nHard to Fill.\nQueer requests are often received\nfor prescriptions, which might puzzle\neither doctor or chemist, far more\nskilled than the proprietor of the ordi\nnary drug store.

E. M’CI.IN’rtK’K, Ohio Experi\nment Station.)\nA small flock of from twenty-five to\nthirty ewes should be found on every\nfarm. A flock of this size can be kept\nat little expense. It will, if given a\nchance, clean the fields of weeds, pro\nvide a supply of wholesome food, and\nreturn to the farmer a neat sum from\nthe wool produced.\nA strong, vigorous, purebred ram\nshould be used. Ewes, to be desir\nable should have straight backs and\ngood mouths. As a rule, sheep have\none pair of permanent front teeth\nwhen one year old. two pairs when\ntwo years old. A ewe with a full\nmouth may be five or more years old,\nbut if the teeth are neither broken nor\nPrize Winning Oxford Down Ram.\nlost, nor worn down, the ewe may be\nbred and kept for a year with good\nresults.\nA small flock of ewes can often be\npastured during the winter on a wheat\nor rye field. The best roughage for\nsheep is clover or alfalfa hay and a\nfew roots. If clover Is not available,\nhowever, corn fodder supplemented\nwith a little bran or linseed meal is\nsufficient. As soon as the lambs are\nold enough to eat, give them a lifCle\ncracked corn where the ewes cannot\nget It.\nA fence that has been used success\nfully by the United States Forest\nservice in protecting sheep from coy\notes is recommended. This fence is\nbuilt as follows: A strand of barbed\nwire is stapled to posts at the sur\nface of the ground; three Inches above\nthis is placed a 30-inch strip of close\nwoven wire fencing, and above this\nare stretched two strands of barbed\nwire.\nIt sheep free from stomach worms\nare secured, little trouble will be caus\ned by these pests. The worms are\nsmall round whitish worms that Infest\nthe stomachs of the sheep. The lambs\nbecome Infested by eating grass on\nwhich the young worms nave crawled.\nIt is recommended therefore, that the\nlambs be placed on pastures that have\nnot been occupied by mature sheep.\nPLAN FOR CASTING A HORSE\nSimple and Inexpensive Method Re\nquire* Only Strong Piece of Rope\nFifty Feet Long.\n(By O. L. PRIEN, Wyoming Experiment\nStation.)\nThe most simple and Inexpensive\nmethod of casting a horse requires\nonly a soft, strong rope 50 feet long\nThe addition of hobbles, to which\niron rings are attached, eliminates\nthe chance of rope burns about the\nfetlocks of the hind feet, but hobbles\ncannot be used on unbroken range\nhorses.\nKnot the rope at the middle oi its\nlength so as to make a loop, which,\nwhen passed over the horse\'s head,\nwill fit the neck like a collar The\nknot is placed lowermost and each end\nof the rope is now passed backward\noutside of each foreleg ana then be\ntween the hind legs and around the\nrespective pasterns.\nBefore running the free ends through\nthe loop collar pass each end over the\nCasting a Horse.\nbackward length o\' the rope This\nholds the rope more snugly about the\npasterns and lessens the chance of\nthe animal stepping out of the rope. A\nsteady pull by assistants on each side\nwill throw the animal. The hind legs\nmay be drawn to the horse’s sides aad\nsecurely fastened.\nLiberal Feed for Sow*.\nThe sow can be kept at very little\nexpense in the spring for the first few\nmonths after her pigs are weaned,\nprovided she has good pasture. But\nduring the time she is suckling her\npigs she should be fed very good food,\nelse she will run down to very popr\ncondition and not be fit to breed for a\nlong Mine.\nThe sensible thing for each farmer\nto do is to practice a rotation of crops,\nIncluding leguminous crops, raise\nmules, horse*, hogs, poultry and other\nlive stock, and grow plenty of fruits\nand vec stables. Under these advanced\nmethods the soil will rapidly increase\nin fertility, the money obtained for\ncash crops will be kept at home, it\nwill not be necessary to borrow\nmoney, or buy on eredlt, and we can\nthen hold our wheat, potatoes, tobacco,\ncorn and other crops until we are\nready to sell. —O. H. Alford, Farmers’\nCo-Operative Demonstration Work.\nFIGURE COST OF BAD ROADS\nHauling Produce More Expensive\nHere Than in European Countries\n—Total Haulage Expense.\n"American farmers have begun to\nfigure the matter of roads a little dif\nferently than in former years,” says\nPresident Claude S. Briggs of the\nBrlggs-Detrolter company of Detroit.\n"When the good-roads movement was\nin its infancy they used to ask them\nselves ‘How much will good roads\ncost me?’ Thanks to the intelligent\npropaganda of the daily and farm pa\npers as well as other agencies farm\ners are now asking themselves ‘How\nmuch are bad roads costing me?’\n“According to government experts\nthe cost of hauling a ton of farm prod\nuce a mile varies from seventeen\ncents in localities where fairly hard\ngravel roads exist to thirty-five cents\na ton in parts of the country where\nthe roads are in poor condition. On\nthe other hand, in those European\ncountries where hard roads prevail\nthe cost is as low as nine cents a ton\na mile. The department of agricul\nture has estimated that the total haul-\nClimbing the Continental Divide.\nage expense to American farmers for\na year is approximately 1500,000,000.\nAnd every dollar of this sum comes\nfrom the farmer\'s pocket, for he is\nthe one great producer who cannot\nadd the haulage expense to his wares,\nfor the prices he gets are on a de\nlivered basis.\n“I believe that if every farmer would\ntake pencil and paper and figure the\namount in tons of the produce and\nstock he markets in a year, multiply\nit by the number of miles he must haul\nit to market, multiply the total by 25.\nwhich is about the average haul\ning cost a ton a mile, and then\nconsider that he could save nearly\nhalf of this amount every year if\nhe had concrete or other hard\nroads all the way to his market, he\nwould become an earnest good-roads\nworker.\n“And this actual dollars and cents\nsaving doesn\'t take into consideration\nthe many advantages of good roads\nin bringing neighbors closer together,\nin making it easier and pleasanter to\nget to church, school, entertainments,\netc.\n“With wider Interest in better roads\nmust come a more efficient system of\nroad building and maintenance. This\nis work for experienced and compe\ntent highway engineers, Just as much\nas building a railroad is the work\nof highly-trained specialists, it is no\nplaything for politicians.”\nSLOW IN TAKING ADVANTAGE\nCertain Loss Due to Bad Roads Made\nApparent When Sledding Is Good\nDuring Winter.\nThe heavy snows and excellent sled\nding serve to emphasize what might\nbe accomplished if good roads pre\nvailed all over the country. Farmers\ncan take their bobs and put on twice\nas heavy loads as is possible at other\ntimes. It is not argued, of course,\nthat with roads as smooth as a dance\nhall floor the teams could pull on\nwheeled vehicles the loads they do\nnow on bobs. But there is a certain\nloss due to bad roads that is made\nall the more apparent by the ease\nwith which transportation is made\nwhen the sledding is good, says South\nBend Tribune. And to think that for\nall these years nature has been show\ning us the advantage of good roads\nand we have been so slow to take the\nhint! It should make us ashamed of\nour blindness and stupidity.\nSolve Social Ilia.\nElbert Hubbard says that “Good\nroads are the most needed thing in the\nworld. Good roads and quick, safe\nand cheap transportation are going to\nsolve most of our social ills.”\nMany Benefit* Derived.\nGood roads will decrease ignorance,\npoverty, discouragement, immorality,\nprofanity, back taxes, sheriff’s sales\nand grouches.\nDutch Colonies.\nHolland, with a population number\ning only a little more than six million\nand with an area only about one-fourth\nthe size of the state of New York,\nranks third among the countries of\nthe earth in the number of its coloni\nals and fifth among them in the area\nof its colonies.

The question In many cases\nIs how to provide for a profitable hay\ncrop next season. Under such condi\ntions the best way to provide for a hay\ncrop next spring is to plow the wheat\nstubble down and prepare a very Arm,\nfinely pulverised seedbed. This, of\ncourse, will Involve extra labor but\nthe Increased yield and quality of hay\nnext year wll\' more than pay for the\nextra labor.

When\n•owing with redtop, 12 pounds of\ntimothy and 3 or 4 pounds of redtop.\nWhen seeding with red clover, 10\npounds of timothy and 6 to 8 pounds\nof red clover la sufficient. If red\nclover has not been succeeding well, 4\nto 6 pounds of alslke clover to tbs\nacre should be substituted for the red\nclover.\n•EASONABLE HINTS FOR THE\nFLOWER GARDEN.\nB. W. ANSPON.\nMaryland Agricultural College.\nAt this season of the year one finds\nmany Insects Infesting the flower gar\nden. The rose Is frequently attacked\nby the rose slug, a small green worm\nwhich chews holes In the leaves. To\ncontrol this pest spray the plants thor\noughly with arsenate of lead at the\nrate of one ounce to two gallons of\nwater.\nPlant lice of various kinds are fre\nquently found on a number of plants.\nThese are sucking Insects that Infest\nthe young shoots of many flowers. On\nnasturtiums and chrysanthemums they\nmay be found on the young shoots. On\nthese plants the black forms are found.\nOn sweet peas and roses we find the\ngreen forms. A red form Is generally\nfound on the golden glow. To con\ntrol these Insects spray the plants In\nfested with a nicotine solution, of\nwhich there are many brands on the\nmarket. A very simple remedy that\nhas given good results la a soap solu\ntion. This can be made by dissolving\na quarter pound of laundry soap In a\ngallon of water. This solution can be\nused In connection with the nicotine ex\ntract, acting as a sticker for the latter.\nGo over he flower borders and re\nmove all faded flowers since these left\ngo to seed and will Impair the flowering\nof the plants.

The most sensible course\nlies between the two.\nPruning the cherry tree does not\nhave so marked an effect in enlarging\nIts fruit as it does on apple or the\npear, but It does tend both to enhance\nthe color of the crop as well as to Im\nprove the tree\'s appearance. The\nbright, full-sized, well-colored cherries\nare the ones that sell and the cherries\nthat are not too thick on the tree and\nnot shut out of sunlight by too dense\nfoliage are those which attain the nec\nessary color and size.\nDid you never notice that the big,\nfine, highly colored cherries are those\non the topmost branches or away out\non the ends of long limbs, or some\nwhere where the air and the sunshine\nget to them? Well, In this there Is\n- !I, t v --\nWell-Pruned Cherry Trees.\nsomething more than a mere aggra\nvating perversity of nature and a dis\nposition to put the best fruit out of\nreach.\nFine cherries must have air circula\ntion and sunlight. These better re\nsults are to be obtained to a consider\nable extent by shaping the tree and\nby properly trimming it every year.\nDo not wait until there are great big\nlimbs to saw off. Cut out the smaller\nbranches growing where they are not\nwanted. Clean out a lot of the little\ntwigs and branches which will have\nlittle If any fruit on them, anyway,\nand which will only exclude the suu\nand air.\nCARE IN MARKETING FRUITS\nIf Plums and Apples Reach Market in\nBruised or Dirty Condition They\nBring Small Prices.\n(By W. Q. BRIEHLV, Minnesota Experi\nment Station.)\nOnly a little extra time and skill are\nrequired to market plums and apples\nproperly. If they reach the market\npoorly graded and bruised or in dirty,\nbroken packages, they cannot com\nmand good prices. Every farm paper\nadvertises the clean, neat packages\nnecessary to show fruits advanta\ngeously.\nPick with care. Don’t wait fur\nplums to soften or apples to become\nmealy. They should‘he well colored\nand large, but still firm. A soft plum\nwill not stay up In the market and\nneither will the price. Pall apples may\nbe picked when full size is reached\nwithout regard to color, or the color\nmay be allowed to develop if desired,\nbut the fruit must not be allowed to\nsoften or drop If It Is to be handled\nprofitably.\nDiscard all bruised, stung or mis\nshapen plums and grade as N’o. 1 those\nof good color, and as No. 2 those In\nferior In coloring. Sort according to\nsize, so that every package is uniform\nthroughout In size of plums which it\ncontains. The same suggestions apply\nto apples, especial care being taken to\ndiscard those that are wormy, scabby,\nbruised, or stung. Uniformity In color\nand size of fruit and size of package,\ncombined with neatness and cleanli\nness of package, will add greatly to\nthe market price of the fruit.\nFighting Plant Lice.\nThe only way of fighting the aphis\nor plant lice is to cover them with\nan oily substance which causes their\nearly death by clogging the pores of\ntheir bodies, therefore kerosene emul\nsion Is often used as a remedy for\nplant lice. Nothing like heavy oils\ncould be used, as they would destroy\nthe follafee.\nStarting Fruit Orchard.\nStarting a new fruit orchard means\nwork from the start. Too many have\nloafed while profits that were expect- I\ned to come In never arrived. The\nsecret of making fruit growing a suc\ncessful profitable venture, is found m ;\nthe word work.\nGrowing Radishes.\nRadishes should he grown quickly\nand pulled at the proper time. They\nsoon become hard and woody. The\nbest plan with radishes is to sow a\nshort row every week until It Is too\nlate in the season to sow them.\nChildren Cry\nFOR FLETCHER’S\nCASTORIA\n■ ■MUTT n\np} ffSMI I r.rhi\\yiP|\nIfisStsa 1\nnih: ALCOHOL 3 PEB CENT. . , \' .\nfcl\'K l Prcpnralion PorAs AIWiIVS I\nS** similaling the Foodancl J\nling (lie Stomachs aiulDuwdsol /M.\niiitainsneilUr n\n..cog Opiimi.Morphinc nor Mineral 01 lv\\\\ir fl^H\nPpjij; Not Narcotic. % Air\n; /tojvt/oufrSMamm IYI\nPmqikut SccJ“ v ill\ni Jfl-t jUxStma * I |/t\njhMum- I f4| i\nMin .
