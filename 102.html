O. I*. Has No Candidate.\nThe general was asked who. In his\nopinion, the republicans would nomi\nnate in 1908.\n"It is senseless to talk of such a\nquestion at this time," ho answered.\n\'T have no more idea than you, or\nanyone else, and I do not believe any\nman can state with any degree of\ncertainty who will lead the forces of\nthe Grand Old Party to success two\nyears hence. It is anybody\'s fight,\nand there are several able men who\nwould like the nomination."\n"You ask when success will again\npearch upon the standard of the dem\nocratic party In a national, campaign?\nNot until the leaders abandon their\npee-wee tactics. How soon they will\ndo this X do not know. When the\ndemocratic party leadérs establish a\nset of fixed principles, the people may\nngnln tqko their candidates for the\npresidency seriously.\n\'But so long as they continue to\nchase rainbows In an effort to eatch\nthe vote of the masses, so long will\nthe party continue to go down to de\nflat.\nSelect Well Known Men.\n\'\'Another\n\'\'Another thing, the democrats must\nnominate men who are known to the\npublic. They cannot expect to win\nby nominating men who are practi\ncally unknown before their nomina\ntions. No matter how able or how\nstrong the candidate may be, the\npeople of America are not going to\nrally to his support* unless they know\nsomething of him.\n"He must have had experience,\nmust have been before the public and\nmust have convinced the public of his\nability by some deed of statesmanship.\nTo illustrate what I mean:\n\'\'The democrats at present are\nmaking a lot of fuss over Secretary\nRoot\'s speech at the Pennsylvania\ndinner in New York the other night.\nHis announced views on centraliza\ntion. they say. has furnished the party\nwith an Issue unpon which they can\nwin in the campaign of 1908.\n"This illustrates Just what I mean\nby \'opportunism 1 . The leaders expect\nto 8lese upon Root\'s speech as the op\nportunity for riding into office.\nJump at Conclusions.\n"The democrats jump at conclu\nions. Why. within the last few years\nthe democrats, especially southern j\ndemocrats have contributed aa modi, j\nor more, to centralization than any j\nother members bf congress. The i\nwhole trend of their actions has been\ntowards deccensing the powers of the\na\na\nIt\nt\nj\nstate. and vesting more power In the ]\nthrough Secretary Root, has praotl\nfederal government.\n\'But now that the administration.\ncaliy declared for centralization, many\nof those same democrats are raising\ngreat fuss. They insist that the\nadministration has furnished them\nwith an Issue.\n"Thus, it is shown that the demo\ncrats have no fixed principles—they\nare opportunists, and such tactic*\nwon\'t win a national campaign. The\noleomargarine bill had no warmer\nfriends than the democrats.\nJumps en J. S. Williams.\n"The same was true of the Hep\nbum pure food bill, and the national\nquarantine laws were supported by the I\nsame men who are now saying that\nRoot\'s centralization speech furnishes\nthem with an issue. Each of these\nbills tended to take fmm the states\nand bestow upon the federal govern\nmenL ,\n"In this they tended /to centralisa\ntion, yet when Root says as much the\nmen who voted for them raise a howL\n"John Sharpe Williams, minority\nleader in the house, is right now ask\ning congress to enact legislation for\nthe control of the liquor traffic in\ncertain instances.\n\'This is an effort to extend the pow\ner of the federal government. Yet\nwhen Mr. Root comes out for a \'strong j\ncentral government, these same men\nraise an awful howl.\n\'TU tell you the democratic party\nwill have to radically change these\ntactics before it gets to be ace high in\nthis country again."\nBUN OVER BY\nHORSE BHD RIG\n1rs. layzie Stewart Has a\nNarrow Escape froa\nDeath\nMrs. Mftyzle Stewart, wife of W.

R. & N.\nPORTLAND, ( )re., Jan. 2.— Krank J.\nSmith, superintendent and traffic man\nager of the Open River Transportation\ncompany, has issued an exhaustive\nstatement concerning the results which\nhave accrued by the opening of the\nupper Columbia river through the con\nstruction of the state portage railway\nand the operation of boats on the up\nper stretches of the stream. In part\nit is as follows:\n"That the river line has proven a\nfactor which cannot be overlooked by\nthe rail lines In making rates is sho*»\'W\nby the new tariff issued by the O\n& N. company, effective January i,\n1907, in which sweeping (reductions\nhave been made.\n"Further reductions must be made\non the rail line in order to meet river\nrates, which are still below the rail\nrates as reduced. It must be apparent\nto the most casual observer that the\nportage railway Is responsible for the\nreductions- made, and that the state Is\nAmply repaid for Its investment and\nIts continued maintenance and exten\nsion abundantly justified.\nReductions Far Reaching.\n"Moreover, it will be observed that\nthe reductions mads by the O. R. & N.\ndo not apply only to points afTected by\ncompetition with the steamers of the\nOpen River Transportation company,\nmade possible by the use of the port\nage railway. The changes made be\nyond river points show how far reach\ning the benefits resulting from water\ncompetition extend.\n"The extension of the portage rail\nway to The Dalles will be of inesti\nmable value In lowering rates and\nexpendltlng the handling of grain."\nPRINT MENU ON POST CARD\nNovelty at Bollinger Hotel Makes Hit\nWith the Guests.\nThe New Year\'s dinner menu card\nat the Bollinger hotel yesterday was a\nnovelty in the shape of a post card,\nsuitable as a souvenir for mailing pur\nposes.

They\nmass the small savings of the working\nclasses which In time are withdrawn\nfor more profitable investment,\ni These postal banks are rightly call\ned "poor men\'s banka" They pro\nvide the means of saving the pennies\nand shining« of wage earners, which\notherwise would be wasted. They\nteach habits of economy and thrift,\nand diminish drunkenness and vice, as\nstatistics amply demonstrate. They\nafford advantages because of the num\nber and convenience of branch post\noffices, and they minimise the trouble\nof withdrawals, and bring banking\nmethod» within easy reach of women\nand minors.\nNotwithstanding our enormous de\nposits In private savings banks, com\nmon experience teaches us that Am\nericans are wasteful to a degree that\nEuropeans can only faintly compre\nhend. We have not yet learned the\nlesson of economy. With many of us\nmoney Is only good for wh^t it will\nbring and the idea of hoarding or\nsaving it is held to be preposterous.\nThe economists tell us that we are a\nnation of spendthrifts and the greater\nour prosperity the more extravagant\nwe become.\nThe object of the postal savings bank\nfs to teach the people the art of sav\ning. We need nurseries of thrift and\nschools of economy. Every postal\nbank would be an object lesson that\nwould have a direct Influence upon\nthe moral well being of depositors and\ntheir families. In times of prosperity\nespecially there is all the more need\nfor thrift among wage earners, and In\nthe absence of "precept and example"\nthe postal banks furnish a medium of\nencouraging this thrift.\nThe value of pressing the open river\nmovement Is made manifest by the re\nport of the superintendent just made\npublic, where facts are presented to\nshow that the operation of the portage\nroad is directly responsible for sub\nstantial freight rate reductions In the\nterritory along the Columbia river.\nAn attempt was made last season to\ndiscredit the movement on account of\nthe small amount of freight that was\nfeeing handled by the association, but\nthe results are not to be reckoned In\ntonnage though that Is very creditable,\nbut In the most substantial results of\nreducing freight rates because of the\nactive competition.\n4 • * «\nTHINK IT OVER.\nOf course you have sworn off, but\nyou have plenty of company and com\npany is what you love Cheer up.\n• • •\nTurn over a new leaf in the ledger\nof life.
