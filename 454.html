Miller, Owner-Manager of\nThe Mississippi Enterprise, local\nNegro newspaper, this week an\nnounces that Arrington W. High,\nformer feature writer and solicitor\nis no longer connected with the\npaper and that he, nor the paper,\nwill in the future be responsible\nfor any contracts or obligations\nmade by High in the name of the\npaper.\nMr. Miller says: “We have dis\ncontinued High\'s services, not be\ncause of any personal feelings we\nmay have against him, but rather\nas a measure to safeguard our pa\nper and the prestige it has built\nhere in Mississippi with colored\nand white, from much unpleasant\npublicity and crticism caused by\nMr. High’s actions and his recent!\nattack on certain organizations and\ngroups.”\nHe says further, “From the day\nHigh came to work for The Mis- j\nsissippi Enterprise, we were severe- j\nly criticized by friends and read\ners of the paper who knew his\npast reputation and criminal rec\nord. Even when his column pro\nvoked much ire and criticism, we\npermitted him to continue to work,\nfor although we did not at all\ntimes agree with everything he\nwrote, we did believe in his right\nto write them.\n“High’s program with the paper,\nthe one he was hired to promote,\nwas not one that we were ashamed\nof, we are, however, ashamed of\nsome of the methods that we have\nsince learned he was using to pro\nmote this program.\nHigh\'s attack on tne National As-1\nsociation for the Advancement of\nColored People, as reported in the\nJackson Advocate and as told to\nus by the local head of that orga\nnization, were entirely unprovoked |\nand uncalled for, and was nothing\nshort of a cowardly way to get\nhimself out of a bad situation that\nhad been created solely by him\nself.\n"It is not now and has never\nbeen, the policy of this paper to\npry into the personal affairs of\nanyone, nor do we take delight in\nreflecting the things that tend to\nshow Negroes in a bad light, hence,\nwe have nothing to say about Mr.\nHigh’s personal conduct that led\nup to the above mentioned attack\non the NAACP. We only want our\nreaders to know that as far as th\npaper is concerned the attack was\nuncalled for, unprovoked and we\nconsider it a very unethical thing\nfor Mr. High to have done. Being\naway on our vacation, we knew\nnothing about it until it had ap\npeared in the Jackson Advocate.\n“This article and Mr. High’s dis\nmissal is our method of showing\nthat we do not condole any such\nactions on the part of anyone con\nnected with the paper.”\nYoung Boy Suffers\nFractured Skull\nWhen Hit By Truck\n—\nA.

No doubt\nyour conception of a college or col\nleges has been formulated from the\nexperiences of others. Possibly a\nfriend or relatives gave you your\nbasic ideas through vivid descrip\ntion of his experiences on some\ncollege campus. Probably this de\nscription appeared quite romantic\nand fascinating or just the oppo\nsite. At any rate it is obvious that\nwhat you think about college and\ncollege life, is in a large measure\nwhat others have thought and\npassed on to you.\nIf perchance you are fortunate\nenough to enter some college you\nmay be pleasantly surprised at\nwhat you find there, take it as a\nmatter of fact or be completely dis\nillusioned. It all depends upon the\ntype of mental imagery which you\nhave formulated from what you\nhave heard and read. If you are\ninclined to be idealistic in your\nthinking you may be in for a lit\ntle disturbance. If you are the\nhappy-go-lucky or don’t-worry type\nthen nothing matters. On the other\nhand if you are the practical type\nthere is little to worry about for\nyou can readily understand and\neasily make adjustments.\nIf you are seriously considering\ngoing to college this year I am\nsure that you have given the mat\nter some thought. I you have\nthought over this problem carefully\nno doubt you have asked yourself\nthe question: What am I going to\ncollege for? There are several\nanswers to this question and no\none except you is eligible to choose\nan answer for you. You must be\nthe sole judge in this particular\nmatter. Many other questions will\nnaturally follow: For example,\nwhat do I want to do for a life\nwork? How may I most effec\ntively accomplish my aim? What\nwill four years in college contri\nbute toward my success in life? Do\nI really need a college education\nfor what I want to do? Have I\nsatisfied myself and others by my\nhigh school record that I am cap\nable of doing college work? These\nare only a few of the vital .questions\nwhich must be settled at the outset\nof a college career or which may\nprove troublesome later if not taken\ncare of at first.\nExperience dictates that these\nsuggested questions and possibly\nmany others, should be carefully\nthrashed out before etnering col\nSAILOR VISITS WIFE\n\'• »■ I\nSecond Class Seaman Eugene\nStigger and Mrs. Eugene Stigger\nSailor Stigger was home on a\nfurlough visiting his wife, Mrs.\nTempia Stigger in her home, 142\nE. Ash St., from the 7th to the\n13th of August.\nDuring his visit the young cou\nple received many social courtes\nies, among them being a Party\ngiven by Mr. and Mrs. David Wal\nker of 142 E. Ash St.\nOn Tuesday, August 9, they were\nguests in the home of Mr. Stig\ngers parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charlie\nHenderson of Flora.\nOn Thursday, August 12, they\nwere entertained by Mr. and Mrs.\nS. S. Brown, cousin of the young\nsailor. On Thursday night they\nwere tendered a Buffet Supper by\nMrs. Eva Wells, sister of Mrs. Stig\nger, and Miss Amelia Thomas of\n247 E. Ash St. At all the affairs\na most delightful time was had by\nthe honored guests and friends.\nOn Friday a “Go-Away” Dinner\nwas served the Stiggers by Mrs.\nFlora Bell Sampson in her home,\n1422 W. Pearl St. Mrs. Sampson is\na sister to the young sailor.\nSecond Class Seaman Stiggers is\nstationed at Fargut, Idaho/\nlege. There are many reasons why\nyou should be absolutely certain\nabout these matters. When you as\nsume the responsibility of any un\ndertaking you want to make your\ntime count for something and your\nevery effort should be focused to\nthat end. You cannot afford to\nentail unnecessary expense and a\nwaste of time shifting from one\nthing to another, trying to make\nup your mind and find your self.\nLet us suppose now that all of\nthese issues have been properly\ndisposed of and it remains only\ntor you to choose your college. In\nmaking your choice what criteria\nDiscrimination\nCharges Lodged\nBy F. E. P. C.\nCharges of discrimination in em\nployment because of race or color, \\\nlodged against 23 railroads and 14 I\nlabor unions, will be examined by\nthe President’s Committee on Fair\nEmployment Practice (FEPC) at\nhearings to be held September 15\n18, 1943, in Washington, D. C. The j\nhearings will be held at the Depart- ,\nmental Auditorium, Department of i\nLabor, 12th and Constitution Ave\nnue, Northwest.\nComplaints received by the FEPC\nallege that the practices and poli\ncies under question fail to con\nform to the provisions of Executive\norder 8802 as amended by Execu\ntive Order 9346, to the detriment\nof the prosecution of the war, the\nworkers’ morale and national uni\nty. Most of the charges involve\nthe question of discrimination\nagainst Negro workers. In some\ncases, workers of Mexican origin\nare involved. One or more of the\nseveral charges involves each rail\nroad and union cited.\nExhaustive investigation by the\nFEPC has resulted in the compila\ntion of a lengthy list of allegations\ninvolving agreements between rail\nroads and unions whereby the ef\nfective utilization of available\nqualified manpower has been ham\nDered hprm ISA nf +\nemployment practices based on race.\nChief among the practices com\ning under scrutiny of the Commit\ntee is that of considering Negro\nrailroad workers “non-promota\nbies. ’ This is alleged to have been\ndone through the negotiation of\nagreements between union and rail\nroad which set certain restrictions\non the percentage of Negroes which\nmay b6 employed in a stipulated\ncategory.\nThese agreements together with\nenactment of union regulations lim\niting or barring non-white member\nship serves, it is charged, tend to\nreduce sharply the number of qual\nified Negroes employed by the rail\nroads despite an increasing need\nfor such labor.\nArgentina says the fact that the\nAxis cause seems lost is no reason\nfor a change in neutrality policy.\nOkay, Argentina, but what’re you\ngonna do with all that beef later\non?\nHands seem to be forming on the\ntentacles of the Nazi octopus and,\nmuch to the disgust of the brain\nsection, they’re trying to shake\nwith someone on our side.\nwill you use?\nSome valid criteria in selecting\na college to attend will be discus\nsed in the second installment of\nL..s article.\nJ. H. OWENS,\nHead of Chemistry Department,\nTougaloo College.\nVolunteer Workers Ready\nTo Back The Attack In\nThird War Loan Drive\nWomen’s Division To\n“Kick Off” Sunday\nWith Patriotic Tea\nOn Thursday, September 9, the\nThird War Loan Drive started. Two\nmillion or more volunteer workers\nset forth to sell $15 billion of War\nBonds to every American citizen.\nAmong these 2,000,000 or more\nvolunteer workers were members\nof the Hinds County Negro Divis\nion of the War Finance Commit\ntee, Rev. A. Buxton Keeling, Gen\neral Chairman, and Mr. E. W.\nBanks, County Chairman.\nRealizing that “VICTORY MUST\nBE PAID FOR” and that every dime\nor dollar invested in War Stamps\nand War Bonds will mean, not\nonly, that they are backing their\nson, or their friend\'s son, but will\nalso mean economic security for\nthe race, in the days after the war,\nJackson and Hinds County Negroes,\nthis week, through the Hinds!\nCounty Negro Division of the War I\nFinance Committee, accepted, not ^\nany special part, but the whole of\nthe county quota of $6,140,000.\nIn a statement made to the\nwriter, Chairman Banks let it be\nknown that his committee wasn’t\naccepting any special quota, be\ncause they did not intend to “let\nup for a single second until every j\nNegro in Jackson and Hinds coun-1\nty had been “Sold” and in doing\nthis he was sure that Negroes would\ndo much toward helping the Coun\nty to exceed its War Loan quota.\nGeneral Chairman Keeling stated\nthat The Hinds County Negro Wo\nmen s Division of the War Finance\nCommittee, made up of Mesdarnes\nH. T. Sampson, Committee Chair\nman; L. M. Hopkins-Ptftton, M. M.\nHubert, Mary Atwood-Smith, Sec\nretary, and Ruth Roseman Deace,\nReporter, has for some time been\nbusy selling Stamps and Bonds to\nhelp Hinds County reach its goal.\nAt a "Get-Together” Tea on Sun- ^\nday, August 29, at the home of\nMrs. H. T. Sampson, details of the\nDrive were explained in pep talks\nby Rev. A. B. Keeling, E. W. Banks,\nG. L. Edwards, Director of the U.1\nS. O., and Dean H. T. Sampson, of\nJackson College.\nThis Tea was the outgrowth of\nplans made at the first meeting of\nthe Committee on Tuesday, August\n24, at the home of Mrs. M. M. Hu\nbert. At this time Mrs. Mary At\nwood Smith was chosen Secretary\nof the Committee.\nPatriotic Tea Sunday\nThe first general report of the\nStamp and Bond Di\'ive will be Sun\nday, September 12, at a Patriotic\nTea in the home of Mrs. Burr\nBrown, 202 E. Monument Street,\nfrom 5 to 7 p. m. The public is\ninvited.\nThe final report will be made\nSeptember 29 at the local USO, at\nwhich time a Million Dollar Lunch\neon and Auction will be held. Plans\nfor the affair were made at a meet\ning August 31, at the home of Mrs.\nSmith.\nThis Committee of 75 women will\nappreciate your cooperation in this\n3rd War Loan Drive, and they de\nserve it. for on every occasion these\nvolunteer workers have responded\nmagnificently to their country\'s\ncall. Just several weeks, ago, many\nof this same group, working not\nmore than one or two days sold\nmore than $3,000.00 Bonds and\nStamps.\nAs the crescendo of our victories\nmounts, it is reasonable to hope\nthat it is leading to the grand fi\nnale of war. Yet we are warned\ndaily that our supreme test as in\ndividuals and as a nation is still to\ncome—that we must pour into this\nwar the entire strength and intelli\ngence and will-power of the United\nStates.\nWe all know it is not enough to\ngive our time and energy and loved\nones. We must buy more Bonds!\nThe buying of Bonds is to our war\neffort what a blood transfusion is\nto a wounded fighter; the difference\nbetween life and death.\nThe Peoples Funeral Home, which\nis the only Negro authorized agency\nfor selling Bonds in the state, has\nstocked up with a large supply of\nBonds in all denominations, as well\nas stamps and all Negroes are ask\ned to purchase your extra bonds\nand stamps during the 3rd War\nLoan from PEOPLES FUNERAL\nHOME, located on corner of N.\nFarish and Cohea Streets.\nThere will be someone present\nat all times to accommodate you.\nREMEMBER—it is up to all of\nhere at home to BACK THE AT\nTACK—WITH WAR BONDS!\nMcLAURIN BROTHERS SERVE COUNTRY\nIn the picture above are Second\nLieutenant Eddie A.

St. Luke 6:31.\nARE WE AFRAID TO DO JUSTICE?\nBy RUTH TAYLOR\nAre we afraid to do justice?\nWhen I saw that caption in one of the religious publi\ncations that come to my desk, its implication—its application\nto our present problems—struck me like a blow.\nAre we afraid to do justice?\nThis is the answer we must give to those pseudo realists\nwho have forgotten to remember the idealism which carved\nfor them, out of an untouched continent, those realities to\nwhich they cling. This is the challenge we must fling at\nthose isolationists who ignore the spirit that created from\nthe resources of the earth a nation self sufficient enough to\ndream it could stand alone.\nAre we afraid to do justice?\nMust we fear fair treatment for all men? Must we\ndraw a barrier of class or creed or color and say—at this\npoint—we must modify our ideal of equality of opportunity\nand of justice before the law? Must we deny freedom of\nspeech or worship to those who do not think as we do?\nMust we keep some people in the shackles of ignorance for\nfear that learning would lift them to our level? Are we\nafraid to give to all men the rights we claim for ourselves?\nAre we afraid to do justice?\nThe world is too small for anything but brotherhood.\nBut to establish brotherhood, there must be justice toward\nall men. Whoever fears justice for others will practice in\njustice upon others.\nAre we afraid to do justice?\nThe one way to make sure that there will not be another\nwar is to mete out justice toward all men everywhere—a\njustice based upon equality before the law and before God.\nNot a maudlin Lady Bountiful charity toward the misfor\ntunate, but a fair administration of the law of brotherhood\nwithout senseless distinctions of race, color, or theorv. To\nquote again from a religious paper: “God has made this earth\nrich enough for everybody’s need, but not rich enough for\nanybody’s greed.”\nAre we afraid to do justice?\nkauk tub attack—with war bonds\nThe Third War Loan is a swift, sure test of your common\nsense, your ability to take it, and a true measure of your\nown flesh and blood, the men you have sent off to do the\nfighting for you.\nIt combines all of these aspects because it comes at a\ntime when American forces are doggedly seeking a decision\non the battlefield, often at the cost of life itself.\nAttack. Counter-attack. Attack. Another ridge. An\nother valley. Another town. All sense of time gone. You\nget weary. You smell death. But you keep going. That’s\ninvasion. That’s the way a war correspondent tells the story\nof what your relatives, your neighbors, your friends are go\ning through at this moment.\nBut what about you? Is it attack, counter-attack, attack\nfor you on the home front? Are you fighting a battle to save\nevery penny possible for War Bonds to back up your fight\ning men?\nThere’s hardly a comparison between vour greatest sac\nrifice on the spending front and the sacrifices in blood and\nsweat of one of your soldiers, sailors, flyers, marines or coast\nguardsmen.\nYour Government comes to you and says:\n‘\'Lend me your money now when I need it to protect you\nagainst your enemies and 111 pay you back with interest a\nxittie later when the men who would murder, rob and en\nslave you are destroyed.”\nIt takes a country like ours to make such an offer. Where\nis your common sense if you don’t run—not walk—to the\nneaiest Bond Booth to lay down your money and exchange\nit for War Bonds? 6\n\\ oui Government is putting its objective before you in\ntwo ways. First in big round numbers like 15 billion dollars.\nSecondly, but more important, it puts the Third War Loan\nmatter up to you in a purely personal way. If you are one\not those Americans who have not yet bought a War Bond—\noj e\\ en a \\var Stamp—it asks you to get busy in a hurrv.\n1 here s something awfully wrong with you if vou won’t put\nan extra rifle, or an extra slip of bullets into the hands of\nyour men on the battlefield.\nThere’s another thing to keep in mind as you face the\ntest of the Third War Loan. You may grumble about the\ncos, of living. That’s not the thing really to worry about.\nI he Nazis and the Japs have let you know that your chief\nworry is living itself if they can get their hands on you If\nyou want one graphic example, remember those American\nmartyrs of Jimmy Doolittle’s Tokyo raid\nThe slogan, ‘\'Back theAttack—With War Bonds,” is ad\ndressed to every American Citizen. Negroes in Jackson have\nas muc‘h right to buy War Bonds as any other citizens Rich\nman, poor man, workers, boss, man, woman or child—we all\nhave something to lend to our country at a time like this\nW e would not be worthy of being an American if we did\nnot have the nbre to trade bread for liberty.\nOUR B°YS ARE crouching in assault boats at this mo\nment.

Having\nscored anew as an American oil\nman battling the Japs in “China,”\nhe was last before the cameras as\nJanoshik, the leader of the under\nground movement in occupied Pra\ngue, in “Hostages,” and next moves\nto Twentieth Century for a stel\nlar role in Richard Tregaskis’ “Gua\ndalcanal Diary.” So the former\nBrooklyn grocery manager appears\nheaded for a career of war films.\nPlaying the romantic lead oppo\nsite Luise Rainer in that same\n“Hostages” is Arturo de Cordova,\nFaramount’s great Latin-American\nhope, who made his Hollywood de\nbut as Agustin in “For Whom The\n\' Bell Tolls,” and who will be star\nred in a series of forthcoming films\nas a result, including “Frenchman’s\nCreek” and “Rurales.” While not\nstrictly speaking a story of the\npresent conflict, “The Bell ’ might\nbe included as a story of the strug\ngle from which World War II de\nveloper. \\\nIn “So Proudly V/e Hail!” story\nof the heroic nurses on Bataan,\ntwo leading men, George Reeves\nand Sonny Tul\'ts, spring to sudden\nprominence. Reeves had been\nknocking around for some years in\nWesterns, and had finally advan\nced to the juvenile in the “Hopa\nlong Cassidy” series for Harry\n! Sherman, when a test he had made\ngot mixed up by mistake with a\nI series of tests which Pro-ducer\nDirector Mark Sandrich was run\ni ning off in the hope of finding a\n! new white hope to play opposite\nI Claudette Colbert.\nSonny Tufts, Yale football player\ni and crew member, had started a\ncareer as a band leader and singer\nin the est when he came out to\nHollywood last Fall purely "on\nspec.” He walked into the Para\nmount casting office, asked for a\njob, and was grabbed as fast as if\nhe\'d been 200 pounds of coffee.\nLast year James Brown, young\nTexas tennis star, was signed by\nParamount an deast in^“Young and\nWilling” as the romantic lead who\nanswer!? a dra/t call. His role in\n\'Air Force,” on loan to Warner’s,\nreached the screen first, and as -\nresult he’s in daily demand.\nHOPE MISSES ENDING\nJust before Bob Hope left for\nEurope, where he is currently en\ntertaining American and British\ntroops, he made a new ending for\nParamount’s “Let’s Face It.” in\nwhich he is co-starred with Betty\nHutton.

So says\nDr. R. N. Whitfield, Director of\nthe Division of Vital Statistics for\nthe State Board of Health, discus\nsing the thousands of requests that\npour into his office daily. Even a\ndelayed certificate of birth is not\ndifficult to obtain if the individual\nwill go about t in the rght way.\nsaid Dr. Whitfield.\nDefining delayed birth registra\ntion as the act of officially record\ning a birth that occurred some\ntime in the past, Dr. Whitfield ex\nplained that any birth record filed\nlater than ten days is a delayed\nrecord.\n“Unfortunately over 100.000 births\nthat occurred after the registra\ntion law was passed. November 1.\n1921." said Dr. Whitfield, “were not\nregistered. This carelessness has\ncaused considerable difficulty for\nthousands of boys and girls con\nfronted with the necessity for birth\ncertificates."\nFor the benefit of people born\nin the state prior to November 1,\n1912. or born after that date and\nnot registred. Dr. Whitfield out\nlined the following procedure for\ndelayed registration of birth: Fill\nout the blank supplied by the State\nBoard of Health; complete the af\nfidavit that the information is cor\nrect; have parent or acquaintance\nof long standing complete next af\nfidavit; furnish two pieces -of evi\ndence over five years old which\nverify name, date and place of\nbirth, and name of parents; mail\nto the Division of Vital Statistics,\nState Board of Health. Jackson, in\none envelope with a short letter\ngiving your name and full address.\nIf a certified copy is desired send\na money order for fifty cents made\npayable to the Mississippi State\nBoard of Health.\nAcceptable documents suggested\nas evidence include school rec\nords, baptismal certificate, state\nments from the U. S. Bureau of\nCensus concerning the next census\nafter applicant\'s birth; statement\nfrom an insurance company if the\napplicant has a policy over five\nyears old. even though the policy\nbe lapsed; birth certificate of a\nson or daughter born more than\nfive years ago.\nHow does Reichsmarshal Goering\nget that way. promising revenge\nfor the bombings of Hamburg?\nMust be a slip of the tongue, be\ncause he\'s the one who said it\ncouldn\'t be done.\nAfter polishing off that Ham\nburg. the Allied bombers are about\nready to put away a dish of blitz\nde Berlin for dessert.\nBuy more War Bonds and Stamps!\nSUNDAY SCHOOL !\nLESSON\nLesson Reveals \'\nThe Bible Is a f\nBook of Realism\nThe International Weekly Sun\nday School Lesson for Sept. 19.\nLesson Text: Numbers 20: 1-13,\n27, 28.\n* * *\nT)ROPHETS and leaders are,\nA after all, human beings, and\nnot without fault. History re\ncords the sins and shortcomings\nof great men, as well as their\nj fine qualities of character and\n, achievement.\nThe Bible is a book of realism\n! that never makes the mistake\neither way.

But in his anger he\ncould not resist the temptation\nto smite the rock.\nWhat a lesson there is in this\nfor us all!

Chil\ndren's teeth also need peroidic\ncleaning by a dentist, an impor\ntant' service requiring time and\nskill. After working for the child\nin the preschool years, the den\ntist will be able to help to esti\nmate the yearly dental budget, to\ntake care of that individual’s den\ntal needs.\nTo help parents keep the den\ntal budget under control, we sug\ngest the following practices: de\nvelop in the child sound eating\nhabits, avoiding sugars and an ex\ncess of starches; take him to the\ndetnist at the age of 2 or 2V2 for\nan introductory visit, and for sub\nsequent visits as the dentist advises;\nhave the smallest defects cared for;\nat intervals of four to six months.\nBuy An Extra $100 War Bond During The\n3rd War Loan\nJ.H.BARE\nTexaco\nDISTRIBUTOR\nPORT GIBSON, MISS.\nFOR VICTORY\nBACK THE ATTACK!\nBUY THAT EXTRA $100 BOND\nDURING\n3rd War Loan\n★\nPORT GIBSON OIL WORKS\nCOTTON SEED PRODUCTS\nPORT GIBSON, MISS.\n3RD WAR LOAN—\nBuy More Bonds and Stamps\nBUTTS and YOSTE\nJEWELERS\nGifts For Every Occasion\nNATCHEZ, MISS.\nSee Our New Line of\nMEN’S WEAR\nShirts, Ties, Socks, Underwear\nHandkerchiefs\nHave Your Garments Tailored At—\nROGERS TAILOR SHOP\nPERFECT FIT GUARANTEED\nREGARDLESS OF FORM- CURVES\nCROSS ROADS OR CORNERS\nA.
