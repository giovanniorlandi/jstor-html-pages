        <pre>['How does a regime manage to stay in power\nfor decades? How do protests that start \npeacefully end up being eclipsed by a devastating\nwar? Did things have to turn out this way \nin Syria? While finding definitive answers may be \nimpossible, two recently published books certainly \nhelp us reflect on these inescapable questions: Salwa\nIsmail’s The Rule of Vio-\nlence and Lisa Wedeen’s Authoritarian\nApprehensions.\nThese latest works from \ntwo influential scholars of \nMiddle East politics and \nsociety complement each \nother. Both authors rely on \nconversations and interviews\nwith Syrians. Both \nprobe the interactions of \nemotion and ideology in \ntheir nuanced analyses of political dynamics under\nauthoritarian rule. And both focus on citizen-\nstate interactions and questions about the nature \nof the Syrian political system.\nIsmail and Wedeen both analyze the push and \npull factors that contribute to the resilience  of authoritarianism.\nIsmail’s account is more concerned \nwith the push factors: How does an authoritarian \nregime set out to create obedient subjects? And \nhow does it react when that effort fails? She speaks \nof violence and brutality not in terms of individual \ngovernment policies but in the context of state \ngovernance and how citizens encounter it.\nFor her part, Wedeen emphasizes how Syria’s \nauthoritarian regime under President Bashar alAssad\n(in power since 2000, when he succeeded \nhis late father, Hafez) has operated in a neoliberal \nera by seeking to seduce citizens with promises of \nthe good life and thereby gain their active support, \nor at least their passive acquiescence. Whereas Ismail\nargues that violence is the key to understand-\ning subjectivity and government in Syria, Wedeen \ndiscusses the ways in which ideology and emotion \nbecome entangled in complex and contradictory \nways as they involve citizens in the ruling system.\nIsmail sees violence as a method and logic of \ngovernance for the Assad regime. It is unleashed \nat times when the regime confronts popular uprisings.\nBut there are also everyday forms of violence \nin interactions between \ncitizens and the state. Ismail\nargues that the extent \nand extreme form of violence\nin Syria—in massa-\ncres, assassinations, and \nprison torture—are aimed \nnot just at crushing opponents\nin the short term, \nbut also at establishing the \nlogic of state-citizen relations\nin the long term.\nThe everyday nature of violence, Ismail says, is \nperformed and communicated via state institutions \nand through political culture. For example, state \nviolence is reflected in the ways in which discipline \nis enforced in schools and youth camps, which live \non in the memories of her interlocutors. Central \nto Ismail’s argument is the claim that collective \nmemory keeps modes of violence at the forefront \nof political subjectivity, which she defines as citizens’\npositioning and agency in relation to the gov-\nernment and its apparatuses of rule. She does not \ndwell on the reasons for the 2011 uprising or explain\nwhat factors changed to pave the way for it. \nBut she suggests that many Syrians felt that their \nsense of abjection had become intolerable.\nIn Wedeen’s account, the key concept is ideology—more\nprecisely, the ideological dynamics that \nensnare citizens in Syria’s autocratic system. She rejects\nwhat she calls “economic determinism” in ex-\nplanations of the 2011 uprising, and seeks to complicate\nthe category of sectarianism, which is often \nlazily deployed in analyses of the region. Instead, \nWedeen focuses on the ideological work of neoliberal\nauthoritarianism. She argues that it creates and \nsustains an “ambivalent middle” constituting the \nmajority of Syrian society.\nBOOKS\n364\nEmotion and Authoritarian Rule in Syria\nOMAR AL-GHAZZI\nThe Rule of Violence: Subjectivity,  \nMemory, and Government in Syria\nby Salwa Ismail\nCambridge University Press, 2018\nAuthoritarian Apprehensions: Ideology, \nJudgment, and Mourning in Syria\nby Lisa Wedeen\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 2019\nOMAR AL-GHAZZI is an assistant professor of media and communications\nat the London School of Economics and Political \nScience.\n', 'The members of this “middle” are those who \nneither supported the uprising nor were tied to \nthe ruling regime. Activists have dubbed them \n“the gray people” and have accused them of taking\nan ambiguous position toward the regime and \nits acts of violence. The “middle” could have tilted \nthe balance in favor of the uprising but it did not. \nWedeen frames this inaction as a political choice. \nShe partly attributes it to the regime’s success in \npresenting its rule as a benevolent form of authoritarianism\nand as the only route to class mobility \nand the good life. One way it has done so is by \nbranding Assad and his wife Asma as a glamorous \ncelebrity couple.\nDOUBT AND FEAR\nDespite the different directions of their arguments,\nboth authors emphasize the importance \nof performance and emotion in authoritarian governance.\nThey both show that authoritarian rule \nand warfare involve harnessing emotions—for instance,\nby encouraging fear of other communities \nrather than of the regime itself, or turning anger \nfrom an emotion with a purpose into a generalized \nreaction to uncertainty.\nWedeen discusses a range of affective dynamics \nthat feed into support for or ambivalence toward \nthe regime. Syrians may feel that they are better \noff with the status quo, or they may harbor sectarian\nfears alongside sentimental nationalism. In her \ndiscussion of neoliberalism, she is more interested \nin the effectiveness of the regime’s promises than \nin the resentment that its glitzy self-presentation \nmight stir among the deprived majority. Compared \nwith Ismail, Wedeen does not sufficiently consider \nfear of the regime as a factor pushing people, especially\nthe middle class, into preferring the status \nquo.\nIsmail argues that horror has been the emotion \ncentral to Syrian governance since the 2011 uprising.\nIn her account of horror and how it seeps into \nboth everyday and spectacular events, she vividly \nreflects on the question of what one would feel \nin the face of massive state brutality. Ismail’s perspective\nimplies that the silence of the “ambiva-\nlent middle” is enforced by fear. When horror is a \nmode of governance, citizens’ subjectivity cannot \nbe understood in isolation from its relation to that \nhorror. When the factors that push citizens into \nacquiescence are so pervasive, they overshadow \nany factors that pull people toward supporting the \nstate.\nWedeen and Ismail each discuss the deployment\nof doubt and uncertainty as a tool of au-\nthoritarian communication strategies. They both \npoint out how the Assad regime has created an \natmosphere where rumors thrive and the unbelievable\nseems to happen routinely. The goal is to \ncause citizens to have a gut reaction of disbelief to \nwhatever they see and hear. That pervasive sense \nof uncertainty is politically useful for authoritarian\nrulers because it prevents the emergence of a \ncoherent counternarrative that citizens can agree \non. Substituted for anger, uncertainty and doubt \nengender a passive sense of despair.\nIsmail discusses this phenomenon in terms of \n“the political uncanny.” She gives the example of \na woman who was believed to have been arrested, \ntortured, and murdered, only to appear very much \nalive on state television weeks after the rumors \nand images of her purportedly mutilated body had \nspread on social media.\nWedeen explores the doubt surrounding figures\nsuch as a singer-activist (whose identity was \nnever revealed) who became the subject of rumors\nthat he may have been a regime informant. \nShe also discusses how doubt and uncertainty \nhave clouded the reporting and circulation of \nnews of chemical attacks in the suburbs of Damascus.\nAt a time when there is a lot of noise about Syria \nbut very little informed analysis or interest in listening\nto Syrians, these two books are necessary \ncontributions. Political observers, who often have \nthe loudest voices, see what is happening from \nnarrow points of view related to their assessment \nof how the situation fits into broader geopolitical \nalignments. Many scholars with Syria expertise \nrely on an essentialist lens that sees little beyond \nreligious sects as political agents or units that date \nback centuries. \nGiven this context, the recent books from Salwa \nIsmail and Lisa Wedeen provide a welcome shift \nin perspective. Instead of exclusively focusing on \nsectarian conflict, or attributing conflict to class \nwarfare, each author offers an analysis that closely\nconsiders how citizens have encountered the \nstate in Syria, and how emotion and memory have \nplayed important roles in these experiences that \nare often neglected by political scientists. ■\nEmotion and Authoritarian Rule in Syria • 365\n']</pre>
