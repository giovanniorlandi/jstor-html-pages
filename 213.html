Thus plastic coated OBBA is found suitable in construction of bituminous concrete road.\n1. Introduction\nThere are different states in India where rocks are not locally\navailable. The stone aggregates need to be transported from\nother places for constructional work. Modified overburnt\nbrick aggregate (OBBA) can solve the problem of shortage of\nstone aggregate to some extent. Bricks are produced from the\nlocally available soil by burning the molded earth to desired\nforms. Approximately 5–10% of bricksmanufactured inmodern\nkilns are rejected because of their nonconformity with\nrelevant specifications [1, 2]. These bricks are overburnt, distorted\nin shape, and considered as waste. OBBA is produced\nfrom distorted bricks by manual or mechanical crushing.\nThe properties of plain OBBA are weaker compared to\nnatural stone aggregate. It has lower specific gravity, high pore\nrate and thus high water absorption, and lower impact and\ncrushing resistance.Themechanical properties of bituminous\nconcrete with plain OBBA are usually inferior to those of\nbituminous concrete with natural stone aggregate. In a recent\nstudy it is found that the bituminous concrete mix with 4%\ncement coated OBBA shows considerable improvement in\nvarious mechanical properties of bituminous concrete mix\ncompared to the plain OBBA concrete mix [3]. Similarly, the\npresent study is extended to modify the OBBA properties by\nplastic coating of various percentages.\nUse of brick aggregate in concrete preparation is not new\nto the engineers. In Germany during the post-Second World\nWar period, it was necessary to satisfy an enormous demand\nfor the supply of constructional materials along with the\nremoval of debris of war for rebuilding the country. By using\nthese rubbles and demolished aggregates, it was possible not\nonly to reduce site clearing costs but also to meet the need\nfor building materials [4]. Mazumder et al. find that the\ndistorted bricks are stronger than normal burnt bricks. The\nLos Angeles abrasion value of distorted brick aggregate is\nbelow the maximum specified limit as mentioned in specifications.The\nwater absorption of the distorted brick aggregate\nis also lower [5]. It is observed that dense graded picked\nbrick aggregate bituminous mixes are as efficient as crushed\nstone aggregate bituminous mixes for use in the base course\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nAdvances in Materials Science and Engineering\nVolume 2016, Article ID 5352787, 8 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/5352787\n', '2 Advances in Materials Science and Engineering\nof bituminous pavement from the standpoint of stability, stiffness,\ndeformation, and voids characteristics [6, 7]. Through\nexperiment, it is found that brick aggregate bituminous\nconcrete mixes are suitable for use in the surface courses\nof bituminous concrete pavements from the standpoints of\nstability, stiffness, and deformation characteristics. But the\nbitumen content requirements of those mixes are much\nhigher than those of natural aggregate mixes [8, 9]. Several\nresearchers study the properties of hot mix asphalt with\nprecoated aggregate and found better results [10]. Use of\nplastic to modify the bitumen and also the use of plastic\ncoated stone aggregate are being studied by the researchers\nto ascertain better results for the better performance of the\nroad pavement. It is found that the properties like moisture\ndamage, stability, and indirect tensile strength are improved\ndue to presence of plastic [11–14].\nIf the thin plastic comes in contact with hot aggregate\nit fills up the pores in the aggregate and forms a thin film\nof plastic coating on the surface of the aggregate. Plastic\ncoated OBBA becomes less porous and thus reduces water\nabsorption to a great extent.\nIn this study plastic coatedOBBAs are used to prepare the\nbituminous concretemix. OBBAs are heated to a temperature\nof 190∘C and shredded plastic bags are spread over the hot\naggregates. In this temperature, the thin plastic pieces get\nsoftened and form a coating over the aggregate of about 90–\n95%of the surface area. Shreddedwaste plastic bags aremixed\nwith OBBA in different percentages as 0.38, 0.42, 0.46, 0.50,\n0.54, and 0.60 of the weight of brick aggregates to improve\nthe properties. The bituminous concrete mix with plastic\ncoated OBBA shows considerable improvement in various\nmechanical properties of the mix compared to the plain\nOBBA. The basic objective of the study is to utilize the waste\noverburnt brick as well as waste plastic in an ecofriendly way.\nThe main objective of the present study is to evaluate the\nplastic coatedOBBAas an alternativematerial for bituminous\nroad construction.\n2. Experiment\n2.1. Material\n2.1.1. Bitumen. Bitumen is commonly known as asphalt\ncement or asphalt. It is mainly used as binder mixed with\naggregate particles to formbituminous concrete. In this study,\nVG-30 grade bitumen has been used as binder to prepare the\nbituminous concrete mix. The penetration test of bitumen\nis carried out at a temperature of 25∘C. The properties of\nbitumen used in this study are presented in Table 1 and\ncompared with the acceptable values mentioned in Indian\nStandard Codes [15–19].\n2.1.2. Aggregates. Aggregates normally constitute 90–95 percent\nof the weight of the total mix. The function of aggregate\nin a bituminous concrete mix is to provide a rigid skeleton\nand to reduce the space occupied by the bitumen content\nand fines. Aggregates have certain physical properties which\njudge the suitability of aggregate for specific uses. The physical\nproperties of aggregates generally refer to the structure\nTable 1: Properties of bitumen.\nSl. number Testperformed Test result\nAcceptable\nvalues\n1 Specificgravity 0.99\n0.99\n(minimum)\n2 Penetration(mm) 83 80–100\n3 Softeningpoint (∘C) 47 35–50\n4 Ductility(cm) 92\n75\n(minimum)\nof the particles that form the aggregate. Though it is difficult\nto model directly the performance of bituminous mixture\nusing aggregate properties, the properties like gradation,\nhardness, toughness, and porosity have major effects on the\nperformance of bituminous mixture. Aggregate impact, Los\nAngeles abrasion, water absorption, and soundness test are\ncarried out as per AASHTO T 96-02 (2015) and ASTM codes\n[20–23]. The test is carried out for stone, OBBA, and 0.38%,\n0.42%, 0.46%, 0.50%, 0.54%, and 0.60% plastic coatedOBBA.\nThe results are tabulated in Table 2.\n2.1.3. StoneDust. Themineral fillers in a bituminous concrete\nmix consist of finely divided mineral matters such as rock\ndust, slag dust, hydrated lime, hydraulic cement, fly ash, loess,\nand other suitable mineral matters. Mineral fillers should\nhave 100 percent of the particles passing 0.60mm, 95 to 100\npercent passing 0.30mm, and 70 percent passing 0.075mm.\nIn this study, stone dust has been used as mineral filler. The\nstandard test method mentioned in ASTM code is followed\n[24].The properties of stone dust, used in this study, are listed\nin Table 3.\n2.1.4. Plastic. Plastic is an essential component of numerous\nconsumer products. All kinds of plastic are not the same.\nThey are usually synthetic and derived from petrochemicals,\nbut few of them are partially natural too. Society of the\nPlastics Industry (SPI) classifies the different types of plastic\nas SPI Code numbers 1 to 7. Plastic with SPI code 1 is\nmade of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) commonly used\nto make beverage bottles, medicine jars, combs, and so forth.\nPlastic with SPI code 2 is made of High-Density Polyethylene\n(HDPE) commonly used to make containers for milk, motor\noil, and so forth. Plastic with SPI code 3 is made of polyvinyl\nchloride (PVC) commonly used to make PVC pipes. Plastic\nwith SPI code 4 ismade of Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE)\ncommonly used to make plastic cling wrap, sandwich bags,\nsqueezable bottles, plastic grocery bags, and so forth. Plastic\nwith SPI code 5 is made of polypropylene (PP) commonly\nused tomake syrup bottles, stadiumcups, and so forth. Plastic\nwith SPI code 6 is made of polystyrene (PS) commonly used\nto make disposable coffee cups, packing foam, and so forth.\nPlastic with SPI code 7 is made of Polycarbonate (PC) and\npolylactide commonly used to make compact discs, medical\nstorage containers, and so forth [25].\n', 'Advances in Materials Science and Engineering 3\nTable 2: Properties of aggregate.\nTest performed Stone aggregate OBBA Plastic coated OBBA\n0.38% 0.42% 0.46% 0.50% 0.54% 0.60%\nAggregate impact value 22.4% 29.6% 28.6 27.3% 26.2% 24.6% 23.9% 23.8\nLos Angeles abrasion value 15.1% 32% 31.3 31.0% 30.1% 27.6% 25.2% 25.2\nWater absorption value 0.96% 6.6% 5.9 5.3% 4.9% 3.5% 2.9% 2.5\nSpecific gravity 2.64 1.89 1.99 2.04 2.16 2.24 2.45 2.46\nTable 3: Properties of stone dust.\nSl. number Test performed Test result\n1 Specific gravity 2.7\n2 Bulk density (kN/m3) 18.1\nTable 4: Properties of plastic.\nType of material Thickness (𝜇m) Softening point\nCup 150 100–120∘C\nParcel cover 50 100–120∘C\nCarry bags 10 100–120∘C\nFilm 50 100–120∘C\nWaste plastic carry bags are used in this study. Plastic\ncarry bags are a type of shopping bags made from various\nkinds of plastic materials. Most of the carry bags are made\nup of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and so forth.\nPE is the most popular and most widely used plastic all\nover the world. This material has wide range of properties\nwith excellent fatigue and wear resistance. It has excellent\nimpact resistance, low moisture absorption, and high tensile\nstrength. The material is characterized by its thickness and\nsoftening temperature. The test results of plastic used in the\nstudy are tabulated in Table 4.\n2.2. Methods\n2.2.1. Design of Bituminous Concrete Mix. Bituminous concrete\nis a composite material commonly used to surface roads\nin flexible pavement. It consists of mineral aggregate bound\ntogether with bitumen and compacted. Bituminous concrete\nis prepared by heating the bitumen in order to decrease its\nviscosity and to dry the aggregate in order to remove the\nmoisture from it prior to mixing. In this study, the oven dried\nOBBAs are heated to 190∘C temperature and then plastic\nshreds of size less than 2.36mm are mixed on the aggregate.\nWhen the plastic shreds come in contact with the hot\naggregate they melt and form a thin film on the surface of the\naggregate. The coated aggregate is kept in room temperature\nfor 24 hrs. The coated aggregate, mixed with hot bitumen in\n150∘C temperature, prepares the bituminous concrete mix.\nThe bituminous concrete is characterized through different\nlaboratory experiments [26].\nBituminous concrete mix is commonly designed by\nMarshall Method. In this method, the resistance to plastic\ndeformation of cylindrical specimen of bituminous mixture\nis measured. The test procedure is used in the design and\nevaluation of bituminous paving mixes. In this present study,\nMarshall Test is performed with stone aggregate as well as\nwith overburnt brick aggregate. The standard gradation of\naggregate to prepare the test specimen, followed in this study\nas per MoRT&H [27], is presented in Table 5. The main\nobjective of themix design is to find suitable bitumen content\nto prepare the concrete mix. The Marshall Method is used\nto determine the optimum bitumen content (OBC). Table 6\nprovides the standard values of Marshall Test results and\ntensile strength ratio (TSR) as specified by MoRT&H. Test\nspecimens have been prepared and tested in the laboratory\naccording to MoRT&H guidelines. From the test results\nthe relationship of Marshall Stability, flow value, voids in\nmineral aggregate (VMA), air void (VA), and voids filled with\nbitumen (VFB) with varying percentages of bitumen content\nfor stone aggregate, normal OBBA, and plastic coated OBBA\nhas been studied. In this present study, 0.38%, 0.42%, 0.46%,\n0.50%, 0.54%, and 0.60% plastic are added to the coarse\naggregate for coating by weight of aggregate. The aggregates\nare heated to a temperature at 190∘C and shredded plastic\nis added to the hot aggregate. The shredded plastic forms a\ncoating over the hot aggregate. The plastic coated aggregate\nis used to prepare test specimen. The Marshall Test results,\nobtained in the laboratory for stone, OBBA, and coated\nOBBA, are displayed in Table 7.\n2.2.2. Stripping Value Test. Stripping value test is the determination\nof binding strength of the aggregate and bitumen.\nStandard guideline as specified by IS: 6241-1971 is followed\nto complete the test. 200 gm of clean, oven dried aggregates\npassing 20mm sieve and retained on 12.5mm sieve is heated\nto 150∘C and mixed with 5% bitumen by weight of aggregate\nwhich is preheated to 160∘C before the preparation of mix\n[28, 29]. It is tested by immersing bitumen coated aggregate in\nwater for 24 hrs at a temperature of 40∘C. When the bitumen\ncoated aggregate is immersed in water, the water penetrates\ninto the pores and fills the voids of the aggregates resulting in\nthe peeling of bitumen. After 24 hr the stripping is observed\nand the percentage of stripping is noted. Test is conducted\nfor the mix with precoated aggregate of 0.38%, 0.42%, 0.46%,\n0.50%, 0.54%, and 0.60% plastic by weight of OBBA. The\nresults are tabulated in Table 8.\n2.2.3. Indirect Tensile Strength Test. The indirect tensile\nstrength (ITS) test is used to measure the tensile strength\nof the bituminous concrete which can be used to assess the\nfatigue behavior.The standard procedure as perASTMD6931\nis followed to prepare the sample for the test as well as to\nmeasure the failure loads [30]. The ITS provides a measure\n', '4 Advances in Materials Science and Engineering\nTable 5: Gradation of aggregate for bituminous concrete.\nSieve in mm % passing by weight of specimen Cumulative % passing Cumulative % retained % of aggregate and mineral filler\n19 100 100 00\nCoarse aggregate 38%13.2 90–100 89.5 10.50\n9.5 70–88 79.0 21.0\n4.75 53–71 62.0 38.0\n2.36 42–58 50.0 50.0\nFine aggregate 55%\n1.18 34–48 41.0 59.0\n0.60 26–38 32.0 68.0\n0.30 18–28 23.0 77.0\n0.15 12–20 16.0 84.0\n0.075 4–10 7.00 93.0\nMineral filler 7%.\nTable 6: Design criteria as per MoRT&H.\nTest\nperformed\nMinimum stability\n(at 60∘C) Flow (mm)\nCompaction\nlevel (both\nsides)\nAir void VMA(minimum) VFB\nMarshall\nQuotient\n(kN/mm)\nTensile\nstrength ratio\n(minimum)\nResults 9 kN 2–4 75 3–5% 10% 65–75% 2–5 80%\nTable 7: Marshall Test results on different aggregate.\nProperties Stone OBBA Plastic coated OBBA\n0.38% 0.42% 0.46% 0.50% 0.54% 0.60\nOBC (%) 05.10 9.4 9.0 8.8 8.3 8.0 8.0 8.0\nUnit weight (kN/m3) 24.1 23.0 23.1 23.2 23.3 23.7 23.9 24.0\nMarshall Stability (kN) 17.50 8.5 9.8 10.6 11.8 12.4 13.3 13.4\nFlow (mm) 3.90 3.1 3.29 3.5 3.75 3.82 3.9 4.2\n% of VA 4.12 4.88 4.90 4.91 4.95 5.0 5.0 5.2\n% of VMA 14.27 21.9 21.7 21.6 20.4 20.1 19.9 18.6\n% of VFB 68.00 83 80.1 79 78.1 74.4 74.2 74.1\nMarshall Quotient (kN/mm) 4.49 2.74 2.98 3.02 3.15 3.24 3.41 3.27\nTable 8: Stripping value test results.\nSl. number\nPlastic for\ncoating\naggregate used\nin the mix\nStripping (%)\n1 0.38% 9\n2 0.42% 5\n3 0.46% 2.5\n4 0.5% 0\n5 0.54% 0\n6 0.60% 0\nof the tensile strength of the bituminous mixes. The test is\nconducted on the conditioned and unconditioned samples.\nThree samples are kept in freezer for 16 hours and then placed\nin a water bath for 24 hrs at a temperature of 60∘C. These\nsamples are considered as conditioned samples. Another 3\nsamples are kept unconditioned. The sample is tested in\nthe Marshall Stability testing equipment. The indirect tensile\nstrength results are presented in Table 9.\n2.2.4. Resilient Modulus Test. Resilient modulus (RM) of\nbituminous concrete mix is an important parameter for\nflexible pavement design and evaluation. It is defined as the\nratio of the repeated stress to the corresponding resilient\nstrain. The resilient modulus of a tested sample is calculated\nfrom the following equation:\n𝐸RT =\n𝑃 (𝑉RT + 0.27)\n𝑡Δ𝐻\n𝑇\n, (1)\nwhere 𝑃 is the repeated load in N, 𝑉RT is the total Resilient\nPoisson ratio generally taken as 0.35, 𝑡 is the thickness of\nspecimen in mm, and Δ𝐻\n𝑇\nis the total recoverable horizontal\ndeformation in mm. The test is performed according to\nASTM D 7369-11 [31].\n2.2.5. Wheel Tracking Test. Rutting is a longitudinal depression\non groove in the wheel tracks. The ruts are formed\naccording to the width of the wheel path.

Rutting characteristics are studied\nusing immersionwheel tracking device.Wheel tracking test is\nwidely used for evaluating the rutting potential of pavements.\nIn this method, a steel wheel with solid rubber tire is rolled\nto and fro over the specimen of bituminous surface of size\n600mm × 200mm × 50mm to test the rutting potential and\nthen rutting depth is measured up to 8000 passes [32].\n2.2.6. Fatigue Life Test. Repeated load test is conducted\nusing fatigue testing machine developed by Geotran, New\nDelhi. An attempt is made to study the performance of\nbituminous concrete with plain and 0.54% plastic coated\nbrick aggregate mix under the applied loads, 2 kN, 3 kN, and\n4 kN, respectively, and frequency 5Hz with sinusoidal type of\nwaveform is applied at temperatures between 35∘C and 37∘C\n[33, 34]. Three specimens are tested for each case.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Marshall Stability, Flow, andMarshall Quotient Properties.\nThe results of Marshall Test show that the stability of the\nmix increases in equal proportion with the increase of the\namount of plastic in the OBBA. At 0.60% plastic coating\nthe value reaches up to 13.4 kN. But the flow value for\nsuch mix is 4.2 which is more than the highest permissible\nvalue 4.0 as mentioned in Table 6. At 0.54% plastic coating\nthe value reaches up to 13.3 kN which is very close to the\nhighest value of 13.4 kN. The flow value is also within limit\nfor such mix. Hence, in this study, 0.54% plastic coating is\nconsidered as optimum plastic content for coating of OBBA.\nThe volumetric properties of this mix at different binder\ncontent versus stability, flow, air voids, bulk density, void filled\nwith bitumen, and void in mineral aggregate are presented\ngraphically in Figure 1. The stability of such mix increases\nby 56% compared to normal OBBA and decreases by 31.82%\ncompared to stone. However, mixes with very high Marshall\nStability values and low flow values are not desirable as the\npavements, constructed with such mixes, may be brittle and\nare likely to develop cracks due to heavy vehicular traffic.This\nstudy also shows that Marshall Quotient value of the mix is\nalso effective for mix with 0.54% plastic coated OBBA.\n3.2. Resistance to Moisture Susceptibility. Stripping value\nreduces with the increase in the percentage of plastic coating.\nStripping value is least when the percentage of plastic coating\nis 0.50 and 0.54%, respectively. It also satisfies the acceptable\nvalue (as per Table 6). Hence 0.54% plastic coated aggregate\nshows a better binding strength with bitumen even when it\nis subjected to the worst moisture content. The coating of\nmolten-plastic over the aggregate reduces water absorption.\nThis shows that the voids on the surface are reduced. The\nfewer the voids the better the quality of the aggregate.\nThe presence of entrapped air in the voids of aggregates\ncauses oxidation of bitumen which results in stripping and\nformation of potholes. Thus, the plastic coated aggregate\nwith fewer voids is considered as a better road construction\nmaterial.\n3.3. Indirect Tensile Strength. Bituminous pavement surface\ncan develop distress due to fatigue. It is caused by tensile\nstrains generated in the pavement not only by traffic loading\nbut also by temperature variation. If the tensile strength is\nhigher and the tensile strength ratio is within the permissible\nlimit, in another way, it can be said that bitumen concrete\nmix is safe against fatigue. From Table 8, it is noticed that\nthe indirect tensile strength (ITS) increases with the increase\nin the amount of plastic content. The ITS value reaches a\npeak value at 0.54% plastic coating and then it falls in both\nconditioned and unconditioned cases. Highest ITS value is\n1.31 N/mm2 for the same plastic content and corresponding\ntensile strength ratio (TSR) is 82.44% which is acceptable (as\nper Table 6). Thus, 0.54% plastic coated OBBA mix is safer\nagainst fatigue.\n3.4. Resilient Modulus Test. The test is performed at different\ntemperatures such as 5∘C, 25∘C, 35∘C, and 45∘C. The test\nresults for resilient modulus test, obtained in the study, are\nshown in Figure 2 for the mix without plastic coated brick\naggregate and for the mix with 0.54% plastic coated brick\naggregate.\n3.5. Wheel Tracking Test. In the present study, the stress that\nthe wheel applies to the specimen is 0.70MPa. Two LVDTs\n(Linear Variable Differential Transducers) are fitted to the\naxle of the rubber wheel to monitor the rut depth.The output\nof the LVDT is connected to a computer. Dedicated software\nmonitors the rut depth and plots the graph for number of\npasses versus rut depth.The wheel tracking results are shown\nin Figure 3.

Fatigue Life Test. The test result shows that the fatigue\nlife of bituminous concretewith plastic coated brick aggregate\nis much higher than that of bituminous concrete with plain\nbrick aggregate mix with equal tensile strain. This is due to\nthe hardness of aggregate mix with plastic coating. Figure 4\nindicates that, for a given tensile strain 𝜀\n𝑡\nof 200 × 10−6, the\ncorresponding fatigue life of bituminous concrete of plain and\nmodified brick aggregate is 355 and 765, respectively. Thus,\nit is concluded that the fatigue life of bituminous concrete\nmix with 0.54% plastic coated brick aggregate improves by\na factor of 2.15. This clearly indicates that BC mix with 0.54%\nplastic coated aggregate is capable of tolerating higher strain\nand taking higher number of repetitions prior to failure.\nThe present investigation positively proves that bituminous\nconcrete mix with 0.54% plastic coated aggregate is expected\nto have much longer fatigue life compared to the bituminous\nconcrete mix with plain brick aggregate mix.\n4. Conclusion\nThe results of the study reveal that the 0.54% waste plastic\ncoated brick aggregate shows better performance as road\naggregate. From this study, the following conclusions can be\ndrawn:\n(1) The stability of the bituminous concrete mix with\n0.54% plastic coated brick aggregate is 56% higher\nthan the mix with plain brick aggregate.\n(2) Moisture susceptibility of the mix with modified\naggregate is lesser than the plain mix.\n(3) The TSR value for the mix with modified aggregate\nis 9.44% higher than mix with plain brick aggregate\nwhich indicates the improvement in the moisture\nsensitivity of the mix.\n(4) Resilient modulus of the mix with 0.54% plastic\ncoated brick aggregate at 35∘C is 102% higher than the\nplain mix which indicates the higher stiffness of the\nmix.\n(5) Rutting failure for the mix with 0.54% plastic coated\nbrick aggregate is lesser than the plain mix and it\npoints out that the failure for this mix may take place\nat later stage.\n(6) Fatigue life of the mix with modified brick aggregate\nis also higher.\nThus, plastic coated overburnt brick aggregate can be used as\nan alternative material for bituminous road construction.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nReferences\n[1] R.
