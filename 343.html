The paper focuses on the interpretation problem of the concept of spectacularity in modern \nphilosophy. The particularities of different conceptions of spectacularity are analyzed and the special \nattention is paid to its role in the development of the modern society. The main objective of the article is the \ncritical analysis of different theories of philosophers and cultural experts in the context of the spectacularity \nphenomenon.  The research applies the methods of the systematic approach and contextual analysis. The \nnovelty of the paper lies in the formation of the strengths and weaknesses of the spectacularity concepts and \nin the development of certain principles of the interdisciplinary study of the phenomenon. This research \ncould be of interest for professionals working in the field of sociology of culture and philosophy of culture.  \nIntroduction \nToday transformations that affect absolutely all spheres \nof culture are conceptualized systematically and \nconsistently within different paradigmatic borders, using \na multidisciplinary approach. We consider it to be \ntopical to analyze the transformation of the \ncommunications within the framework of the \nphilosophical and cultural approach focusing on the idea \nof spectacularity. \nThe main part \nThere are philosophical ideas, which relevance in \nscientific communities at the time of their articulation \ndoes not seem obvious. In modern researches on \nspectacularity the principles of the Situationist analysis \nthat are worded in the book of Guy Debord “Society of \nthe Spectacle” [1] are actively used. In Russia at the time \nof publication, the study did not attract much attention of \nthe scientific community, although the study generated a \nwave of the critical publications caused by \nsuspiciousness in relation to discourses of leftist-minded \nwestern intellectuals. \nBut as time passed, the interpretation of Debord \nbecame a paradigm for many social critics and theorists. \nToday the problems of spectacularity, visuality, \ncontemporary forms of social protest and engagement of \nyoung people in these movements are already generating \ndetailed substantive discussion. \nThere is no such a tendency as rigid \nconceptualization of a spectacularity phenomenon in the \nmodern philosophy today in spite of the fact that in a \nculturological and philosophical discourses a certain \nsystematization of the approaches and theories takes \nplace even more often, so far as we are talking about \nspectacularity of any subject or phenomenon. The \norigins of this concept can date back to the West \nEuropean culture of Modern times of the XVII-XIX \ncenturies. In the French language the word \n“spectaculaire” appeared in the beginning of the XX \ncentury, replacing the earlier adjective “spectaculeux” \nmeaning “solemn”, “reminding performance”, \n“excessively theatrical” [2]. \nThe analysis of works of foreign culture experts and \nphilosophers allows us to identify several specific types \nof spectacularity, for example promoting concentration \nand immersion in work; the carnival; the performative; \ndetermining sports, fashion, policy. No matter what type \nof spectacularity it is, it refers to a material cover of a \nshow (scenery, picture, music, dances etc.), but mostly \nmeans the influence which all these effects make on the \nviewer. \nIn social and philosophical literature special attention \nis devoted to the following subjects: war as performance, \nperformance and mass media, post-colonial \nperformances, subcultures and performance, the body as \na performance, the Internet and web performances, etc. \n[3, 4, 5, 6]. In modern theoretical ideas of the \nphilosophers, culture experts, art and theater critics of \nthe West, the opinion on carnival, gaming, theatrical \nnature of social life and ways of its’ perception is \nwidespread. \nWhen mapping the political vector, social theorists \nsubject the following to a special reflection: public and \nvirtual space of a social protest, repertoires of alternative \nprojects; creation of temporary urban “autonomous \nzones”, collective dramatic art of overcoming \ndepression, tactics of microresistivity of authorities, as \n \n, Web of Conferences 01057   (2016) DOI: 10.1051/\n  \nSHS 2 shsconf/20162808 10\nRPTSS 2015 \n57\n © The Authors,  published  by EDP Sciences.

Mead, according to which there are \nthree types of cultures, each of them has different \noccurrence of sociocultural intergenerational interaction. \nPrefigurative cultures are oriented to the future and \nreflect the times in which we live. [7] It allows us to \nprove why all the stage effects in the modern social \nspace and all dramatic art “life practices” can be \nanalyzed as an example of socio-cultural life of young \npeople. Probably, it is possible to disagree only with the \nrecognition that prefigurative culture in modern society \nhas taken a dominant position. There is no doubt in the \nfact that this modality will plot one of the major vectors \nof the civilization development. If to acknowledge the \nvalidity of the thesis which we described above, it is \nquite natural, and it correspond to the logic of the \nresearch. \nOne more group of sources includes the texts \nmeaningfully related to the “Dialectic of Enlightenment” \nby M. Horkheimer and T. Adorno, who postulated \ntotality of the culture industry in contemporary society \nand showed that “entertainment becomes prolongation of \nlabor in the late capitalism”, and “art is only a kind of \nthe goods manufactured, delivered, equated to the \nindustrial production, on sale and replaceable” [8, page \n264]. And, for example, Das Passagen-Werk of W. \nBenjamin showed the modern interpretation of the \nphenomenon of perspective modernity – reality (and the \nmost characteristic feature of) which is in the \nconsumption of spectacle (illusions) in exchange or in \naddition to material benefits [9]. G. Lukacs’s concept \n[10] is also very important: the interpretation of \n“spectacle” offered by Debord follows from the \nopposition of formation and praxis [1].  \nAs a matter of interest, only four of Debord’s theses \nhave got very extensive development in the socio-critical \nphilosophical and cultural literature. They are: thesis 10: \n“The Spectacle is “affirmation of all human life, namely \nsocial life, as mere appearance” [15], thesis 6: “The \nSpectacle…occupies the main part of the time lived \noutside of modern production” [15]. And there is one \nmore fairly simple statement formulated in thesis 16: \n“The Spectacle subjugates living mento itself to the \nextent that the economy has totally subjugated them” \n[15]. And, finally, thesis 30 is “The alienation of the \nspectator from the profit of the contemplated object \n(which is the result of her/his own unconscious activity) \nis expressed in the following way: the more she/he \ncontemplates, the less she/he lives; the more she/he \naccepts recognizing herself/himself in the dominant \nimages of need, the less she/he understands her/his own \nexistence and desires. The externality of the spectacle in \nrelation to the active person appears in the fact that \nher/his own gestures are no longer hers/his but those of \nanother’s who represents himself/herself to her/him. This \nis why the spectator feels nowhere when at home, \nbecause the spectacle is everywhere” [15]. It is even \nmore significant that the basis for its development has \nbeen drawn from the different ideological discourses: \nAdvanced capitalism, Consumerism, Mainstream. But it \nhappened in a variety of forms such as Public relations, \nTabloid journalism, Dumbing down, Framing.  \nAgainst this background, there arises the demand for  \nan increasingly high level of spectacularity. It permeates \nmany areas of culture, everyday life and sport. For \nexample, in football, this requirement changes the style \nof the game itself, where it is showiness that begins to be \nappreciated but not effectiveness. A significant place in \nthis process belongs to journalism, which sets up the \nperception of viewers in a certain way, and photography \nthat captures the most "spectacular" moments of the \nmatch. In social terms, the football craze covers all the \nwider community, and the behavior of the stadium \naudience begins to serve as one of the indicators of "the \nmood of the masses", it means that football with its \nspecial spectacularity is  within the political scope. Such \na synthesis of spectacularity and real existence of \ncultural phenomena gives birth to the absolute otherness \nof all the content of culture and sociality.  \nIn response to Debord’s work  in modern cultural \nstudies not only the idea spectacularity, which permeates \nall life practices, has began to be discussed but also such \nan actor of contemporary urban cultural field as a \nflâneur. T. McDonough, a contemporary commentator of \nDebord’s ideas, writes in his article entitled «Situationist \nSpace»: Operating in the realm of everyday life, the \ndérive constitutes an urban practice that must be \ndistinguished,  first, from “classic notions of the journey \nand the walk,” as Debord noted in “Theory of the \nDérive.” The dérive was not simply an updating of \nnineteenth-century  flânerie, the Baudelairean strolling of \nthe “man in the crowd.” This is not to say that they do \nnot share some characteristics: both the  flâneur and the \nperson on the dérive move among the crowd without \nbeing one with it» [16]. Describing this type of a city \ndweller, the researcher concludes, that figures of such \nkind could in some degree shape the scopic regime of \nmodernity: «But whereas the  flâneur’s ambiguous class \nposition represents a kind of aristocratic  holdover  (a  \nposition  that  is  ultimately  recuperated  by  the  \nbourgeoisie), the person on the dérive consciously \nattempts to suspend class allegiances for some time. This \nserves a dual purpose: it allows for a heightened \nreceptivity to the “psychogeographical relief” of the city \nas well as contributing to the sense of “dépaysement,” a \ncharacteristic of the ludic sphere. For the situationists, \nhowever, the dérive was distinguished from flânerie \nprimarily by the critical attitude toward the hegemonic \nscopic regime of modernity» [16]. Gradually this issue \nbegan to be discussed as a problem of Iconization \nprocesses and urban spaces [17, 18, 19, 20]. Jeffrey \nAlexander formulated his ideas of visuality, performance \nand spectacularity of modern entertainment culture in the \nfollowing principles: \n• Icons are material surfaces configured \n(aesthetically formed) in a such manner that their \nexperience generates collective reactions and feelings. \n• Iconization processes are some events and practices \nleading to the emergence of iconic surfaces. \n, Web of Conferences 01057   (2016) DOI: 10.1051/\n  \nSHS 2 shsconf/20162808 10\nRPTSS 2015 \n57\n2\n', '• Pictures are the signifying, or representing surfaces, \nsome of which are able to intensify iconic e\x02ects (not all \ndepictions, or signifying surfaces are iconic ones) and \n(re)present images. \n• An image is a meaningful whole, accessible \nexclusively through sensual experience and hence (re)presented\nby icons and pictures (Of course, the question \nremains: how does language contribute to forming \nimages and social icons?) [21]. \nIt is now gradually happening that elements of the \nshow, demonstartion, representation sideline pragmatics.\nEven political rallies lose their intellectual functions \n(discussion, argument, explanation, etc.) and turn into \nthe performance,  the degradation of the public sphere \ntakes place: the citizen becomes a spectator, a viewer \nwho is watching the action in which she/he does not \nparticipate. Of course, politics as such needs some \nspectacularuity, but if it starts to replace it completely, \nthen one could talk about the changing of the type of a \nsociety. Such context of the development of the society \nsets the whole program of « non-spectacular art » which \nis thoroughly permeated with the spirit of the avantgarde.\nThe avant-garde poetics evolves from theming of \nthe autonomy of art and its expressive means to \novercoming the boundaries between art and non-art \n(consciousness and existence, sign and object perception \nand representation, and so on) to the production of the \nidentity of moments between the two. This can be \novercome in various ways: at the level of the "revolution \nof the imagination" and intensification of life experience \n(Surrealists) or at the level of the dissolution of art in the \nproduction of "new life", building a "monistic universe" \non the basis of industrial production and collective \nproperty (for constructivists). But all of these programs \nrequire the autonomy of art as its prerequisites, provided \nwith a system of art institutions, and the existence of \nborders between the signifier and the signified, the sign \nand the object. It is possible to consider the project of  \n"nonspectacular art" as the reaction to the « excessive \nspectacularity » and  the mass medial obsession suffered \nby the art in the 90s, and also in the context of the \nspectacularity paradigm of culture as a whole. There \nexist many supporters of both positions among the \nadherents of the social critical theory. The important \nthing here is what development strategy of the artistic, \ncommunicative and cultural practices of the researchers \nseems to be the most promising: either it is the escape \nfrom reality or achievement of the  identity man-action, \nman-behavior and thus eliminating the splitting of the \nexistence of two incarnation, eliminating the dichotomy \nbetween art and life [16]. \nIn the present situation there arises the strategy of \nbuilding a "closed", esoteric artistic context and thus a \nclosed artistic community as opposed to the totality of \nglobalized "society of the spectacle". The object, or \nrather, the situation which obtains aesthetic value within \nthis context, is not read from the outside and does not \nstand out from the everyday background. \n« Nonspectacular art”  is immanent to the  order of \nthings ", that is why the goals of this art are always \n"local and specific." This update reveals the basic \nproblem, which questions now existing nonspectacular \nart: how to avoid the separation from reality and at the \nsame time maintain a critical distance? If to admit that \n"none-spectacular art" is politically active and critical, it \nis necessary to take some kind of transcendental position \nfor the criticism of the society. Such transcendental \nposition is possible inside this society by means of \ncultivation of “nonspectacular islands” in the midst of \nthe universal obsession with "the demon of images." In \nthis connection, it is necessary to raise a fair question the\nold question of engaged art. All this leads to the \nconclusion that Debord’s  ideas are still relevant, and not \nonly in terms of  Situationist ideas but also in terms of \nunderstanding the culture as a whole. A visual appeal or \nspectacularity as an aesthetic category refers to visual, \nmonumental, total. It meets the needs of the modern \nspectator, formulated by Thomas Krens, the Director of \nthe Foundation of the Guggenheim Museum, and this \nmajor need is “to get the total, serial, the increasing \nintensity of the experience” [17]. \nNow it is possible to add this to the ideas of G. \nSchultze [11]. \nG. Schultze considers aestheticization as the factor \nstructuring sociocultural fabric in the developed world. \nAccording to Schultze, orientation of a person towards \nself does not become the reason of social dissociation \nand disintegration of traditional social relations, because \ncollective experiences are very powerful. On the \ncontrary, it is the reason that people with the internal \norientation are more likely to take part in collective \nevents, since we are talking about the type of \nexperiences that people can only experience together. \nInterpretation of aesthetical experiences as something \nephemeral and unreal is peculiar to the left tradition, \nbeing in which W. Benjamin, G. Debord, and also \nMarxist philosophers W. Fritz and F. Jameson criticize \nboth democratization of aesthetic, and theatricality of \nmodern society. \nJ. Baudrillard relating to the left model defines \nephemeral and unreal in life of the modern person as a \nterm simulacra. Simulacra by Baudrillard are signs or \nnot self-identical phenomena referring to something else, \nso that they are simulative. Simulation is a basis of \nhyper-reality, which persistently replaces reality in \ntoday\'s society. We see here an echo of the concept of \nthe Russian theorist of culture, M. Bakhtin, in which \nthere is much opposition of official and folk culture, and \nalso it admits existence of traditions, values, which are in \nthe “vertical” (absolute recognition of the hierarchy of \nvalues), where there are norms and regulations of \nmimesis which carries mainly silent people. \nUnlike the left critics of a mass aestheticization, (for \nexample, idem Benjamin, who believed that \naestheticization comprises blocking of reflexive ability \nof the subject) G. Schultze declares that on the contrary \nit increases reflexivity. Schultze points to the direct \nconnection between the extension of opportunities for \nindividual choice associated with the democratization of \nsociety and the aestheticization of life. In this approach, \nthe idea of the American authors, B. Joseph Pine II, \nJames H. Gilmore, in the work “The Experience \nEconomy” [12], where the experiences received by the \nphenomena that Debord criticizes appear not as a feature \n, Web of Conferences 01057   (2016) DOI: 10.1051/\n  \nSHS 2 shsconf/20162808 10\nRPTSS 2015 \n57\n3\n', 'of the strategy of the modern media industry. Quite the \nopposite they appear as a radically new social \nphenomenon, affecting the socio-cultural transformation \nof the whole of modern society and are of interest. \nConsequently, followers of aestheticization tell about the \nspectacularity, which find its place in “experience \nsociety” with the dominance of the “experience \neconomy”. Here hierarchies, regulatory provisions and \nsystems of values are absent. The person here becomes \nan accomplice in production of experiences, sets \nparameters of the desired dramatized tradition and \nactively participates in production of dramatic art of all \nactions, from production to consumption. \nAnalysis of the theoretical foundations of \nspectacularity allowed us to point out the opposing views \nof this phenomenon. Basically, our thoughts were \nstimulated by discussion that the phenomenon of the \naestheticization of daily occurrence is introduced in \ntoday’s reality. We have based our arguments on the fact \nthat the most significant in this aestheticization is that, \naccording to Schulze, it changes “internal orientation” of \nthe subject. But according to Benjamin it promotes to a \nfight of two modalities of basic social processes: on the \none hand, increasing individualization (subjectivation \nassociated with aesthetic experience, this also is the \nincreasing individualization); on the other hand, “the \nincreasing organization of the masses”, resulting in the \nability of the system to manipulate “atomized” \nindividuals. \nThus, these two approaches help to separate key \nfeatures that are associated with the Schultze’s thesis or \nthe Benjamin’s thesis. Nevertheless, we can also speak \nabout existence of the social ambivalence, which is \nshowed in a “fight” of two modalities of social processes \nand the phenomena: on the one hand, increasing \nindividualization caused by an aestheticization, on the \nother - the increasing “organization of the masses”. So it \nis possible to define one more, intermediate point of \nview, which demonstrates various aspects of the \nspectacularity, shows all “pros” and “cons” of this \nendless process of representation and image making. \nThis could include a whole nonspectacular art \nrepresented as reaction to an excess hypertrophied \nspectacularity, obsession of mass media and glamour. \nHere the movements opposing the logic of glamor finds \nits place, which is against submission to what they see as \na substitute for real depicted, united by the general idea \nof the rebellion authenticity against virtuality.  \nConclusion \nThereby we tried to develop the basic ideas of the \ninstitutionalization of the aesthetics of modern \nspectacularity activity. We are inclined to the idea \ncharacterizing the trends of modern society, which \ngeneral sense is that today the spectacularity forms of \nexistence in the information world, which facilitate \ncreation of a zone for “collective” social experiences, are \nmost successfully assimilated. \nThus, spectacularity studied as a constant of the \nmodernity, a mental model of society, the main form of \nreceiving and exchanging of information, a way of \ncommunication, perception of reality and world around \ninterpretation, and also a basic mode of realization of \nmodern life practices allowed us to find out the \nfundamental bases of modern culture. They also revealed \nthe principles of its architectonic, including the \nexperience which we gain in this spectacularity. Based \non this analysis, it seems possible to state that the \nspectacularity is an important cultural phenomenon in \ncontemporary reality. At the present stage the cultural \ncomponent moves to the forefront and starts \npredetermining all others: social, economic, political, \netc. This cultural component at this stage takes the shape \nof spectacularity. \nReferences \n1.
