The\nbrain, like the digestion, has a\nmarked tendency to get into hab\nits, either bad or good. And. if\nany one goes to bed at different\ntimes, later on some evenings\nthan others, the brain Is liable\nto select the latter hour as the\none for falling asleep. This\nmeans that even on the nights\nwhen people go to bed in good\ntime they canuot get to sleep\nfor the next hour or two. If\nthey would keep to the one hour\nregularly the Drain would soon\nieam to do the same. Dozing in\nfront of the Öre in the evenings\nis responsible for many bad\nnights. Even if people are tired\nand sleepy at, say, 9 o\'clock. It Is\nbetter for them to read or play\na game or move about in order\nto avoid falling into a doze A\nbrisk walk of ten minutes or so\nbefore retiring is ofteu fonnd to\nbe one of the best sleep pro\nducers.

We\nassume that he is a member of the\nBaseball Players\' fraternity, and as\nsuch lie should have waited before\nsigning with outlaw baseball at least\nuntil the national commission had tak\nen action on the demands of the fra\nternity."\nIn regard to taking the Tinker case\nto the courts, Bernard York, counsel\nfor tlie Brooklyn club, said he had not\ngiven the subject sufficient study to\nhe able to say just yet whether resort j\nwould be taken to the federal courts or j\nthe New York or Illinois state courts. I\nSpeaking offhand, lie said inasmuch as\nthe Brooklyn club is a New Jersey\ncorporation and the Tinker deal with\nthe Federal club was presumably\nmade in Chicago the injunction would\nbe sought in the United States court.\nYork conceded that in this event the\nfight of organized baseball against the\nFederal league might reach the United\nStates supreme court.\nAs to the Federal League.\nPublic sympathy appears to he with\nthe Federal leaguers, and there is no\ndoubt that they will get a certain\namount of support purely through sen\ntiment. A baseball fan is a fickle In\nstitution and hates peace. But he also\nlikes his good baseball. lie will be for\nthe Fédérais strong at the start, but\nunless they show as good baseball as\nthe players in the older leagues he\n■will not stick. Next to trouble the base\nball fan loves his money\'s worth, and\nunless the Federal league gives it to\nhim he will run right out y ml leave\nit flat.

STURDEVANT\nNeat Job Work at this Office', 'TAX PROBLEMS ANALYZED\nIN AN EXTENSIVE REPORT\nThe following is n report submitted\nin mass meeting at the Guild hall, at\nMoscow, Tuesday night, January 18, by\nthe Civic Corn in It tee of the Chamber of\nCommerce nnalysizing the taxation\nproblems in Latah county. The report\nwus submitted as a result of the de\ncision of the (timber of commerce to\nendeavor to learn If possible the\nsource and disposition of revenue\nraised in Latah county. The report\nwus submitted in a spirit of non-par\ntisanship and only with a view of be\ncoming more familiar with the work\nings of the revenue law rather than\nto investigate any particular branch\nof the county government.\nTo the Chamber of Commerce,\nMoscow, Idaho.\nMr. President and.\' Gentlemen:\nIn accordance with our promise\nyour civic committee is submitting a\npreliminary report on the finances of\nthe county. For the information of\nthose present who are not familiar\nwith the formation of this committee\nand its operation, I will state that we\nall have noted for some time past (he\nincreasing amounts that we are re\nquired to pay in the way of taxes. Our\ntaxes have been increasing by leaps\nand bounds and the reason therefore\nis not readily understood. .The fol\nlowing questions are being continual\nly asked: (1) Where is all of this\nmoney going? (2) Are we getting\nvalue received therefor? (3) Is it\npossible for us to reduce the cost of\ngovernment? And (4) If so, how?\nSome time ago our worthy presi\ndent, believing that the chamber of\ncommerce could be of great public\nservice if it would attempt to answer\nsome of these qeustions, suggested the\nappointment of a committee for that\npurpose. The chamber of commerce\naccepted the suggestion and authoriz\ned the appointment of a committee tc\nbe known as the civic committee. Tht\npresident named the following on said\ncommittee: C. U. Butterfield, Dr. F.\nL. Barrows, and L. F. Parsons. From\nthe discussion that was had at tht\ntime this committee was formed, it\nwas distinctly understood that it wai\nto be non-partisan and was not tc\nbe dragged into politics. If it hat\nnot been thus, you may rest assured\nthat the members of this committee\nwould not have accepted the task\nplaced upon them.\nIt was quite evident from the dis\ncussion had that there was no idea\non the part of anyone that our of\n(leers were grafters or that our fundi\nwere being diverted to illegitimate\npurposes. Your committee entered\nupon its duties believing that our of\nfleers are honest and are giving ue\nas efficient service as lies within\ntheir power; that the reason for higl\ntaxes lies in the system or mach\ninery provided by law for the handl\ning of our public business ratliei\nthan in the individuals operating the\nsystem. Proceeding along this line\nuur officers have shown us everj\ncourtesy and have co-operated with us\nto the fullest extent. We hope that\nin the consideration of our prelim\ninary report this evening and in oui\nfuture discussions of this subject that\nit will be borne in mind that we are\nconsidering the system or machinery\nof the government rather than the in\ndividual operators of pa,rts thereof.\nTaking up our preliminary report on\nthe county we will endeavor to show\nthe amount of money raised in the\ncounty by taxation and other sources\nduring the past four years and then\nI, y figures try to answer the question,\n"Where does our money go to?" The\nfigures presented are taken from the\ntax rolls and the reports made under\noath by the county auditor.\nAt our last meeting a member pre\nsented to you figures taken from the\ntax rolls of 1912 and 1913, showing\nthe assessed value of the property in\nthe county, the amount of money that\nthe levies\'made for those years would\nprobably raise. As these figures have\nbeen published the majority of you\nare now familiar therewith. We are\nagain calling your attention to the\nsame figures; but before doing so we\nwould state that these fl B urcB d ? n0\nrepresent m sM : actually received and\nexpended for*the purposes indicated\nThey represent figures complied at the\ntime the board sits as a board of\nequalization and represent the amount\nin prospect and to be collected for the\npurposes indicate. The full amount\ns never collected; cancelled and de\nlinquent taxes having to be deducted,\nTo make a comparison of 1913 with\nprevious years it is necessary to use\nthese prospective amounts owing tc\na\nin\n19\n19\nat\nbe\nto\ned\n19\nof\nof\ni9\nthe fact that the result of the collec\ntion of this year\'s taxes is not avail\nable—the comparison so made prob\nably being a fairer one than to com\npare the receipts and expenditures of\na fraction of 1913.\nObserving the figures you will note\nthe assessed value of all the property\nin the county figured on a cash basis:\n19 10 ..................... $16,600,575\n19 11 ..................... 17,532.352\n1312 ..................... 19,616,065\n1919 ..................... 22,233,315\nIn 1910 the property was assessed\nat $6,640,230 whiQh was supposed to\nbe 40 per cent of the full value. We\nmultiplied this by 2j£ to convert it\nto a cash basis. You will note a con\nstant and rapid increase in the assess\ned valuation. You will next note the\namount of money in prospect to be\nraised as per the levies fixed for state\nand county purposes. These are:\n1919 ........................ $235,000\n1911 ........................ 314,971\n191 2 ........................ 275,576\n19 13 ........................ 386,827\nYou will note a marked variation in\nthese amounts. There was an increase\nof $79,459 for 1911; a decrease in 19lÜ\nof $45,341; and an Increase of $111,\n248 in 1913. Of these amounts to be\nraised the following were for state\npurposes:\n1919 ...................... $48,522\ni9 H ........................ 51,422\n1912 ........................ 46,827\n1913 ........................ 49,320\nFor county purposese the following:\n1910 ........................ $104,590\n1911 ........................ 161,882\n1912 ........................ $102,256\n1913 ........................ 133,093\nFor roads:\n1910 ........................ $ 900\n1911 ........................ 35,072\n1912 ........................ 29,603\n1913 ........................ 33,899\nFor schools:\n1910 ........................ $44,500\n1911 ........................ 42,191\n912 ........................ 64,102\n913 ........................ 110,471\nFor cities and villages:\n910 ..................... $27,800\n911 ........................ 34,401\n912 ........................ 32,784\n913 ........... 60,036\nThese figures are approximate,\njund numbers being used for conven\n■bce of expression.\nThe reason for the small amount\n( roads shown in 1910 is due to the\nict that collection of road tax for that\near was under a different law than\nuat of following years. Under the old\ntw it was permissible to work out or\nay the road over-seer special road\nixes. We are calling your attention\n• the assessed value of the property\ni the county, it shows an increase of\nve and one-half million dollars in the\n..ist four years. This is a very rapid\nicrease and it is questionable whether\niny such increase in the wealth of\nihe county took place. A considerable\npart of the Increase is probably due to\nincrease in value placed on the same\nproperty by the assessors. This in\ncrease in value has no effect so far as\ntheir taxes are concerned provided\nthat the increase is equally distributed\nover all classes of property within the\ncounty and the property of all counties\nis assessed on a like basis of valua\ntion; so that the cost of state govern\nment is equitably proportioned to the\nseveral counties. The statement is\nfrequently made that our county as\nsessed value is too high, as compared\nwith other counties. This committee\nis not in a position to say whether\nthis is true or not. To determine this\nis would be necessary for us to have\nthe information placed before the\nstate board of equalization; this is not\nat our disposal.\nWe will now call your attention to\nthe totals for county and state pur\nposes. You will note a great increase\nin 1911 over 1910 and a decrease for\n1912. Glancing over the figures show\ning the purposes for which this money\nwas raised you will observe where the\nincrease or decrease took place, you\nwill note that there was a marked in\ncrease in 1911 for all purposes ex\ncept that of schools, while in 1912\nthere was a decrease all along the\nline except for the same purpose\nthere being an increase approximately\nof $22,000 for school purposes. We\nnow come to the consideration of the\ngreat increase of 1913 which was so\nforcibly brought to our attention at\nour last meeting. The figures show an\nincrease of over $111,000 over 1912.\nThe question at once arises, why? A\nresident of the county explains the\nreason therefor as follows: He says\nthat $100,000 thereof is for the pur\npose of building a new Court House;\n$10,000 to equip the same; and $1000\nthe\nthe\nthe\nfor\nfor\nbe\nof\nbe\nit\nto\ndo\nit\na\nfor incidentals. It was brought out\nat our last meeting that this increase\nwas made up of increases for pur\nposes approximately as follows:\nStete .........................$ 2,500\nCounty ....................... 30,500\nRoads ........................ 4,500\nSchools ...................... 46,000\nCities and villages ............ 27,500\nAt eur last meeting in discussing\nthese figures it was assumed that\nthese amounts were excesses over and\nabove the acutal need therefor; that\nthe amounts proposed to be raised in\n1912 were sufficient for carrying on\nthe government of the county. Ob\nserving the figures you will note that\nthe amount raised for the several\nfunds for 1912 was much lower than\nfor the preceding year except for\nschool purposes which was higher\nfor that year. Owing to the great dif\nference shown by these figures for the\nfour years it is impossible to select\nany one as a basis of comparison. We\nbelieve that the average amounts to\nbe raised for the years 1910, 11, and 12\nwould give us a more equitable basis\nof comparison. The averages are ap\nproximately at follows:\nState ........................$ 48,930\nCounty ...................... 119,909\nRoads ....................... 32,338\nSchools ..................... 50,264\nCities and villages ........... 31,662\nComparing the amounts to be raised\nfor 1913 with these averages we have\nthe following increases:\nState .........................$ 396\nCounty ....................... 13,184\nRoads ........................ 1,551\nCities and villages............. 28,374\nSchools ................. ». 60,207\nThe question at once arises, why\nthese increases? As the increases in\nthe amounts to be raised for state and\nroad purposes are negligible we will\npass them. In the county we note the\nfollowing increase in the revenue to\nbe collected this year from taxes\n$13,000. At our last meeting a resolu\ntion was passed asking the Commis\nsioners to be present and explain the\nincrease raised for county purposes—\nit appearing at that time that they\nwere raising some $30,000 over and\nabove the actual amounts needed for\ncounty government. We have taken it\nupon ourselves to explain this matter.\nWe note that the Commissioners have\nhonored us by accepting our invitation\nto be present. In the event that they\ndo not concur in the explanation made\nthey may add whatever they may see\ntit.\nReturning to the excess raised\nwhich compared with 1912 is $30,000,\npenditures, expenditures which\nion of our new revenue law,\nt is the opinion of the officei\nhave to do with this law that\nrequire some three to five th\nmore to carry out its provision\nthat of the old law. We have pi\nit $4,000. (3) The Commissioners pro\nvided for the County Fair, $2,000. Thit\nyear was the first year that the Com\nrying on this commendable\n(4) For improvements and changes in\nthe County Court House, $1200; for the\nemployment of Probation Officer,\n$1000—a total of $8700.\nAt the close of 1912 there was a\ndeficit of some $3,000 or an average\ndeficit of $1000 per year for the three\nyears averaged. The Commissioners\nhad to raise this amount, $3000, in ad\ndition to the average amount raised for\nthe three years mentioned to take care\nof said deficit and $1000 to prevent the\nsame deficit this year, giving a grano\ntotal of $12,700. Thus the probable\nadditional expenditure for 1913 will\napproximate the excess raised by the\nCommissioners.\nWe will now consider the increase\nshown for school purposes. In this\nconnection we would state that the\nlargest increase and over one-half of\nthe total increase in the taxes in pros\npect for the year 1913 is shown in the\napproximate $60,000" increase for\nschool purposes. Your committee is\nnot at this time prepared to make an\nextended report on the subject of\nschools. Early in our labors we noted\nthe large proportion of our taxes go\ning for school purposes. This great\nexpenditure led us to believe that\nthere was necessity of a more detailed\nexamination into the methods of the\nhandling of our educational system\nthan we were in a position to make.\nWe also believe that our education is\ncosting too much and if so, that it is\na state matter Inasmuch as our school\nsystem is governed in general and in\ndetail by state laws. We, therefore,\nlleve that an exhaustive study of our\nschool system and the cost thereof\nshould be made by those more conver\nt\n-\n.\n1\n1\nl\nt\n-\ns\ne\n•ant with educational matters and thaï\nthe matter was of as much importance\nto ether counties of the state as U\nLatah. We, therefore, requested the\nDepartment of Education of the Uni\nversity to co-operate with us in mak\ning a thorough investigation, Profes\nsor Soulen, head of the Departmen\nof Education at the University, is nov\nmaking a survey of this county ant\nother counties of the state. At some\nuture date we hope that Professer.\nSoulen will be able to point out to us\nwhere this and the other counties o!\nhe state may be able to cut down thit\njreat cost of educating our children.\nAs to the great increase this yeai\nor school purposes we are not in f\nposition at this time to give the rea\nson therefor other than the point\nbrought out at our last meeting, thaï\nthere has undoubtedly been raised an\nunnecessary amount in some of thi\ndistricts of the county owing to an er\nror made upon the part of the boards\nand the voters of the various dis\ntricts, voting special levies far in ex\ncess of their needs. We know this\nto be true in several instances. Hence\nthe remarks in reference to watching\nthe use of the excess and for suggest\ning the economy in the use thereof\nare pertinent on this point, in refer\nence to the increase shown for cities\nand villages we are not in a position\nto explain at this time. The city of\nMoscow has made levies for 1913 much\nlarger than for any previous year, As\nto the need thereof, we will state that\nthis question will be taken up in our\nreport upon our investigation of the\nfinances of the city. It is not within\nthe province of this committee to make\ninvestigation of other cities and vil\nlages of the county. Some of the in\ncrease noted, as pointed out before, is\nundoubtedly due to error resulting in\nexcessive levies, the same as in the\nschool districts. We are advised that\nin our neighborhood city of Kendrick\nthey have raised sufficient money this\nyear to carry oil the city business fqi\na period of three years. We note by\nthe papers that the city council has\ncalled a meeting of the tax payers for\nthe purpose of determining what to do\nwith this surplus money. They are\nconsidering the advisability of improv\ning their streets therewith, or return\ning a paft of the money to the tax\npayers, or placing the money out at\ninterest. We understand that there\nare several other towns and villages in\nthe same position as our neighbor\nKendrick. We citizens of Moscow are\ninclined to envy them their position,\nwishing that the finances of our city\na\na\n----\n1910\n1911\n1912\nAver.\n% 1913\n8(738|0iT\nÎÔ|39ÏÏl83\n8\n154\n75\n9\n094\n54\n5\n952\n21\n6[883|70\n7\n805\n51\n7\n580\n57\n7\n423\n26\n5\n698\n36\n7\nSOS\n74\n6\n459\n62\n6\n246\n64\n5\n818\n98\n11684\n83\n2\n333\n41\n1\n438\n90\n1\n819\n04\n2\n391\n65\n1 950\n89\n2\n135\n42\n1\n842\n64\n1\n976\n32\n1\n463\n23\nSuperintendent of Schools. ..\n2|lG9\n20\n2\n468\n97\nO\n511\n96\n2\n383\n38\n2\n223\n93\n1 ! 185\n51\n1\n274\n54\n1\n184\n05\n1\n214\n70\n807\n48\n1328\n60\n341\n95\n362\n05\n344\n20\n166\n00\nCommissioner ..............\n21732\n97\n31321\n54\n2\n897\n93\n2\n984\n15\n2\n816\n84\nProbate Court .............\n1-790\n55\n2\n406\n61\n2\n976\n49\n2\n391\n22\n2\n680\n98\n25\n5\n672\n60\n2\n956\n85\n4\n155\n23\n3\n498\n45\nCourt House ...............\nll553\n55\n2\n037\n16\n1\n900\n59\n1\n830\n43\n2\n641\n40\nCounty Poor ...............\n4|624l35\n3\n563\n03\n3\n596\n67\n3\n928\n03\n3\n427\n25\nJustice Court ..............\nD0I6I80\n1\n525\n15\n927\n;>n\n1\n156\n50\n186\n95\nCounty Physician ..........\nI901Î91\n1\n052\n15\n693\n00\n882\n35\n1\n364\n58\nGeneral Election ..........\n7\'402\'78\n015\n00\n7\n354 i 27\n41925\n75\n682\n87\nMiscellaneous ..............\n1 \'328Î84\n1|703\'05\n2 325|l 7\n.11785169\n5|176|99\nTotal Current Expense....\n50|205 32\n55|250\n66\n55\n168\n26\n53 ! 541 j 41\n41\n800\n76\nRoad and Bridges ..........\n40! 509(92\n451890\n63\n58\n440\n32\n48|280 29\n47\n919\n52\nSchool .....................\n84 ! 733193\n931201\n20|121\n293\n63\n99|742|92\n80\n246\n38\nIn glancing over the figures for each\noffice for several years it will be noted\nthat the amounts expended hold quite\nuniform. There is nothing to indicate\nthat any of our present officers were\nspending any considerable amount\nmore than their predecessors. There\nis nothing particularly startling shown\nin these figures to cause the committee\nto believe it necessary for them to\nmake a detailed investigation of any of\nthe offices. The average cost of each\noffice is as follows:\nClerk, $9,094.54; sheriff, $7,423.26;\nassessor, $6,246.64; treasurer, $1,819.\n04; attorney, $1,976.32; superintendent\nof schools, $2,383.38; surveror. $1,214.\n70; coroner, $344.20; commissioner,\n$2,984.15; probate court, $2,391.22;\ndistrict court, $4,155.23; justice court,\n$1,156.50; court house, $1,830.43; coun\nty poor, $3,928.02; county physicians.\n$882.35; general election, $4,925.75.\nThe following officers collected for\nfees, etc., for 1911 and 1912 as follows:\n1911 1912\nClerk and Auditor $5,190.38 $5,433.65\nSheriff ........... 1,272.72 1,114.07\nAssessor .......... 856.01 634.00\nTreasurer ........ 48.18 325.80\nProbate Court..... 1,717.30 1,461.20\nThe figures showing the expense of\nthe several offices represent the items\nchargable to what is known as the\ngeneral expense fund. The total\namount taken from this fund during\nthe past three years are as follows:\n1910, $50,205.32; 1911,$55,250.66; 1912,\n$55,168.26, the average thereof being\n$53,541.41. So far this year we have\nexpended $41,800.76. Before leaving\nthe subject of current expense I wish\nto\nIt\ncrc in like condition.\nIn this connection we wish now to\nall attention to the fact that the board\nf county commissioners has no dis\n.retionary power in the matter of mak\nng tax levies for independent school\nlistricts, cities, and villages; but are\nbsolutely bound by the levies voted\n•y such public corporations. No mat\ner how excessive the tax may appear\na be, the commissioners must make\n\'te levy. In anticipating further ex\nendltures the fact should not be over\nooked that we are a growing commun\nty, and that we are growing In ideas\ns well as in numbers and wealth, and\na this account we may look for a\n.mall increase in expenditures from\near to year. In the towns and vil\niges we are calling for and getting\nirger schools, and we hope better\nmes. We want out streets improved\nn grading, macadam, or paving. We\nwant better water works, sewers and\nsanitary conditions. In the rural dis\ntricts better schools are required and\na little plot of ground for agriculture,\nand better grades on the roads and bet\nter roads. We hope that the time will\nnever come when we will not want\nthese things The wish shows pro\ngress; the lack of it stagnation. What\nwe do want is to know about our tax\nmoneys, to know that they are handled\nwisely and well, and that we receive\na dollar\'s worth of benefit for the dol\nlar spent.\nWe, therefore, will now take up the\nquestion of "Where does our money\ngo?" The following figures are taken\nfrom the report of the auditor for the\nseveral years. In 1910 there was re\nceived from:\nTaxes ....................$147,928.77\nOther sources ............. 73,445.51\nTotal ..................... 221,374.28\nFor 1911 :\nTaxes ....................$199,069.57\nOther sources.....•........ 112,948.54\nTotal ..................... 312,018.11\nFor 1912:\nTaxes ....................$103,828.77\nOther sources ..............109,894.69\nTotal ......................213,723.46\nThe figures for 1913 are not available.\nThese amounts rebeived were dis\nbursed as follows:\nTo state 1910, $49,662.37; 1911, $52,\n306.61; 1912, $47,842.02, and to county\nas follows: 1910, $171,711.91; 1911.\n$259,711.50; 1912, $165,881.44. The fol\nlowing figures show how the several\namounts apportioned to the county in\nthe several years were spent. The\nfigures in the column headed 1913 re\npresent the expenditures for the first\nnine months of this year.\nto correct a statement I made at the\nlast meeting. The figures made for\n1911 show that there was considerable\nmore expense for the majority of of\nfices than during the previous or sub\nsequent year. I attributed this to the\nfact that our receipts that year were\nmuch larger than usual and money be\ning freer there was a tendency to\nspend more along all lines. Upon\nfurther investigation we find that ow\ning to a change made in the end of the\nfiscal year by legislature that there\nwas included in the figures of that\nyear the expenditures for fifteen\nmonths, \' consequently the increase\nshown. The next source of outgo for\nour money is for roads. During the\nyear 1910 we expended thereon $40,\n509.92; in 1911, $45,890.63, in 1912, $58,\n440.32, a total of $144,840.87, an aver\nage of $48,280.29 annually for the three\nyears. These figures are only approxi\nmate and do not represent all ths\nmoney expended during the time men\ntioned. During 1910 and a part of\n1911 the old law in reference to the\npayment of road taxes was enforced.\nIt was permissible to work out or\npay the road overseers road taxes dur\ning that time. Thus the records do\nnot show the full amount expended.\nThe amounts we are spending for\nroads are rapidly increasing. So far\nthis year we have spent $47,919.52.\nThe third and last source of expendi\nture as shown by our county records is\nfor schools. During 1910 we spent for\nschool purposes $84,733.93; in 1911,\n$93,201.20, and in 1912, $121,293.63, a\ntotal of $299,228.76 and an annual', 'average of $99,742.92. This average it\nhot fair for comparison purposes with\nwhat we are now spending as here\nagain our expenditures are rapidly in\ncreasing. So far this year the schools\nhave coat us $80,246.38. The increased\nexpenditure for school purposes ac\ncounts-very targely for the great in\ncrease\' in our county taxes. As the\nfunds for city and villages are raised\nand expended independently of a coun\nty and as thé county has nothing tc\ndo therewith other than to collect the\ntaxes levied, we will not consider then;\nat this time. Of the expenditures made\nduring the past three years we find\nthat on the average 49 per cent\nthereof was for schools, 23 per cent\nfor roads, and 27 per cent for current\nexpense. Putting it another way, foi\nevery $100 spent, $49 was for schools.\n$23 for roads, and $27 for county ex\npense. The expenditure so far made\nthis year shows approximately 48 pei\ncent for schools, 28 per cent for roads\nand 24 per cent for county expense.\nBy these figures we believe we have\nanswered the question, "Where does\nour money go?" We do not claim ac\ncuracy for these figures, They are\napproximate only, but as accurate ae\nany it is possible for your committee\nto obtain.\nWe now come to the consideration of\n"Are we obtaining full value for. oui\nmoney?" "Can we reduce these ex\npenditures? If so, how?" fn asking\nthese questions you have put us de\ncidedly up against it. These are ques\ntions generally answered by politician\nwith the greatest of ease, but you will\nbear in mind that none of your com\nmitteemen are politicians; hence thej\nfind it very difficult to answer them\nThe committee would answer them\nhowever, as follows; (1) "Are we ob\ntaining full value for our money?\'\nNo. (2) "Can we reduce these expen\nditures?" Yes. (3) . "How?" Elimi\nnate partisan politics from county gov\nernment.\nWhen we come to consider whether\nwe are receiving full value for our\nmoney and ways and means of re\nducing taxes we bump up against the\nproblem of figuring cost and of reduc\ning the same, which is nothing mort\nnor less than the consideration of the\nsubject of efficiency. In speaking ol\nefficiency we ment those general prln\nciples of business as used by our large\ncorporate interests. Efficiency hat\nbeen developed to its full extent in\ncorporate management and there if\na general movement now on foot to\ninject the methods of private corporate\nmanagement into the handling of oui\npublic business. It is being applied\nmore and more, and today we have one\ncity in the United States which is be\ning governed practically as a corpor\nation. 1 refer to Dayton, Ohio, when\nthey have employed at a large salarj\na city manager whose duty it is tc\ngovern the city as he would a larg*\nmanufacturing, mercantile, or trails\nportation corporation. The principle!\nof corporate management of countiet\nhas not reached such a high develop\nment. There has been some endeavoi\nin the state of California to apply thb\nprinciple. It was neccessary, however\nfor them to obtain an amendment ti\nthe constitution of their state to per\nmit them to organize the county some\nwhat on the same basis ns cities arc\norganized. It would be impossible un\nder our present laws for this count}\nto attempt to use the principles o\'\ncorporate management. We are now\ngoverned almost entirely by our state\nlegislature that tells us in what man\nner our money shall be raised and ex\npended and how our accounts shall\nbe kept, showing our receipts and dis\nbursements. The system provided b>\nthem is of no value for the purpose\nof determining costs. Our expend!\ntures are of two general classes; (1)\nGeneral expense from which we obtain\nno tangible property in return. (2)\nFor expenditures made and for which\nwe do receive value in the way of\nproperty, rights-of-way for roads, and\nschool property and the equipment\nthereof, etc.\nThis second class represents what\nis generally termed a capital account\nThe expenditures made from the gen\neral expense account, as shown by out\nrecord, contains not only general ex\npense but also charges which should\nbe made to the capital account; in\nother words, all the funds which we\nexpend and term general expense arc\nnot such. The improvements to our\nreal property and personnl property\nptirhcased should represent capital\nThe same is true with our road and\nschool funds.\nIt Is impossible as our nccounts are\nnow kept to determine the actual cost\nof handling the business of the county\nas there should be deducted from the\nexpenditures made all charges which\nrightfully belong to the capital ac\ncount. It is very difficult from the\nreports of our auditors as provided by\nstatute, to determine the exact condl\nby\nof\n.\na\ntion of the county so far as resources\'of\nare concerned. It is also difficult\ndetermine at any set time the exactly\ncondition of our financial standing.\'done\nVnyone taking reports as now provided\nby statute can come to any number\nconclusions as to the receipts, and\nexpenditures of the county during the\nime for which the report is made.\nThe first essential necessary in the re\nJuction of cost is to know what we are\npaying for the\' things of which we wish\no reduce the cost. From the present\norm of our reports this is impossible.\nExpenditures are never made by\n/ell organized corporations except up\nn good business principles and gen\nrally along some general line of pol\n.cy. Our county funds are not ex\nended along such lines. Our expen\n.itures, outside of our county fixed\nharges imposed by law, are made pri\nmarily upon petition to the\' county\n.ommissioners who have no organized\n.veil defined general plan in mind.\nJur public purse is a sort of grab bag\n/ith each community of the district\nudeavoring to grab as much as possi\njle. We elect county commissioners to\nhandle the business of the county and\nexpend approximately one-quarter ol\nmillion dollars a year and this they\ndo in four sessions a year of about two\nweeks each. Under our present ar\nrangement the business of the county\nis incidental and secondary to the reg\nular business of the commissioners\nThey have no great amount of time\nfor formulating or constructing any\ngeneral plan for the exiienditurc of the\ncounty\'s funds and any action on theii\npart along good business lines is prob\nably prevented by statute. Thus the\ncommittee is of the opinion that little\ncan be done along the line of decreas\ning the expenditure made from the\ngeneral expense fund without new leg\nislation. When we consider the money\nexpended from the road fund which\nrepresents approximately 25 per cent\nof all the money which we nay In\ntaxes, approximately $60,000 per an\nîum, we are Inclined to the opinion\nihat something can be done in the\nway of getting more for our money\nhart we have in the past. At the pres\nent time we believe that our roads\nire an investment of from two to three\nnillion dollars; that it, we have at\nleast paid that much for them in laboi\nmd in taxes. The roads of the county\nie an asset and have a great physical\n•alne. If we would but look upon oui\noads In the same manner the railroad\nofpanies look upon their right of-way\n;nd handle and maintain them in the\name manner as the railroad com\nantes, we believe that the time would\not be far distant when we would have\ngreat deal better roads than we hare\niday. If we would lay out and con\ntruct our roads on the same theory\ns the railroad companies; that is, that\nie roads are for traffic and for the\nurpose of earning dividends,\n/ould be more careful with our road\nund, invest more intelligently and to\nreater advantage. Be believp that we\nre not receiving full value for the\nloney that is lieiug spent upon oui\noads, not because of dishonesty of the\nommissioners or our road over-seers\nut owing to the lack of technical\nnowledge on the part of those we eni\ndoy to build and maintain said roads\nload building is a science and requires\nechnical knowledge. It is the beliel\nif the committee that a great saving\nould he made by this county and bet\ner roads obtained if they would em\niloy a man to take charge of all road\nonstruction for the purpose of build\ning up a road system throughout the\nounty which would consist of several\nmain arteries and branches necessary\no provide service for all the people\nif the county. We believe there is\nlothing in the statute that would pre\nsent our county commissioners from\nemploying such a man. Five per cent\nif the money annually expended in the\n-ounty for road purposes would amply\nr-ompensatç a highway engineer.\nWe have asked the engtneering de\npartment to take up th study of the\nquestion of roads and to tell us sc\nfar as it is possible what our roads\nare costing us; and we have also put\nit up to them in this way: "We are\nspending so much on our roads today.\nCan you give us better roads than we\nnow have and how much can you save\nus?" At some future date we hope\nthat the engineering department will\nbe able to submit a report of interest\nand suggest, some general plan which\nwould be desirable for the counties to\nadopt.\nWe have considered the matter of\nschools and the possibility of reducing\nthe cost thereof. We have already ad\nvised you of the action we have taken\nin this matter of having a more thoro\nInvestigation and report by the de\npartment of education. There is a pos\nsibility\' of reducing the cost of our\nschools provided that we can obtain\ngood and passable roads so that it\nwill be possible to reduce the number\nof school districts. The cost per capi\nA\nas\non\nit\nta of educating th« children in some\nour rural districts Is very excessive.iclear\ntejsome of the schools which have but\nhalf dozen students could be\naway with, provided we\nit\ngood roads. It is impossible to deprive\nthe children of an education. But the\ncost of this education where the num\nber of students is small is very great\nA number of districts have been con\nsolidated during the past year but\nother small schools spring up wher\never there is a tendency to the settle\nment of a new section of the county.\nWe will leave future recommendation Id\nthe matter of schools until such time\nas Professor Soulen makes his report\non the survey of the matter.\nOwing to the high taxes there ap\npears to have been a great deal of cri\nticism of our new revenue law and the\nworking out of the same. It has at\nready been discussed several times in\nthe chamber and mention made of the\nneed of amendments to this law. It\nshould be remembered that the new\nlaw went into effect last May and has\nbeen in operation only eight months\nWe have not as yet seen the complete\noperation of all of its provisions. We\nhave not seen enough of the working\nout of this new law to stajt the agita\ntion for amendments and believe noth\ning should be done along this line until\nit has had a fair trial and until the\npeople become better acquainted there\nwith and the officers become more fa\nmiliar with its workings. Some of its\nprovisions are quite radical and very\ndifferent from those to which the of\nficers have been accustomed and it\nundoubtedly was hard for some ol\nthem to adapt themselves to the meth\nods of the new law. We believe that\nsome of the difficulties which now ap\npear large will diminish when the peo.\npie and officers become more familiar\nwith it. It has been suggested that\nwe dispense with the tax commission\nsince the supreme court has deprived it\nof all authority. We believe that this\nis a step in the wrong direction and\nihat our efforts should be directed to\nwards obtaining a tax commission with\nauthority. The principle of tax com\nmissions is the principle of efficiency\nand shoulld be endorsed by this body\nIt occured to the committee that il\na study of the matter ef taxation could\nb« made from a scientific and non-par\ntisan point of view, that a great\namount of information could be ob\ntained that would be of value to all\nthe people of the state. A great ser\nvice could be done by the University\nof Idaho if they would take np the\nstudy from an aconomic point of view\nand compare our revenue laws with\nthe laws of other states and accumu\nlate the best thought obtainable on the\nmatter of taxation.\nWe, therefore, requested the depart\nment of economics at the university tc\ntake up the study of this question with\nthe purpose heretofore stated. Pro\nfessor Robinson is now working on the\nsubject and it is the belief of this\ncommittee that he will give us some\nthing worth while on this matter\nYou have undoubtedly noted that\nthis committee has apparently unload\ned a very large part of the work as\nsigned to it upon our university. Wt\nhave done this with malice and afore\nthought, believing the question assign\ned to the university to be of state-widi\nimportance; that is the proper fune\ntion of state institutions of this char\nacter to furnish such information U\nthe public at large for the purpose\nof educating them upon matters of vi\ntal importance to their interests. Wc\nbelieve that our state university car\nassist largely in the prevention of er\nror on the part of our county and othei\nofficials and that they can do this bj\nfurnishing them with the general in\nformation necessary for the canduct of\nthe office to which they may be elected.\nWe believe that at the time that an\nindividual enters upon public duties\nhe should be provided with the laws\ngoverning his office and general in\nformation necessary for the proper\nconduct of the public business he may\nbe called upon to handle. As an il\nlustration we would call your attention\nto the office of road over-seer. The\nUnited States department of agricul\nture, our national board of good roads,\nand also our state board are expend\ning a great deal of money on the sub\nject of good roads.. The public press\nis overloaded at times with articles\non this subject. There is a world of\ninformation available on the subject\nof good roads, but which very largely\ndoes not fall into the hands of the\nindividuals who have to do the build\ning of our roads. If the information\navailable could be compiled, published\nand a copy thereof placed in the hands\nof each road over-seer at the time that\nhe enters upon his duties, we believe\nit would assist materially in the pro\nduction of better roads and decrease\nthe expenditures we are making for\nthat purpose. We believe that our\nuniversity is in a position to provide\nthis information. Our laws governing\nthe action of school boards are not\na\nor concise and in a great manvi\ninstancesneedth"inteUlgence "f an\nlargelyattorney to interpret what our legisla\nhaveltjire intended. Our state board of edu\nil\ntc\nU\nbj\nof\nan\nin\nil\nof\nthe\nfor\nour\nnot\ncation furnished each school board\nwith a copy of the laws, which is com\nmendable on their part; but for the\nguidance of the average school board\nwe believe that these laws should be\ndigested and put in plain language.\nInformation should be placed in the\nhands of our school boards advising\nthem how school levies are made.\nVery frequently friends of certain in\ndividuals believe they are performing\na kindness in placing a friend on the\nschool board and that friend may never\nhave had the matter of school and edu\ncation brought to his attention and\nmay be very ignorant on the matters\npertaining to raising revenue and con\nducting tne business of school dis\ntricts.\nWe believe it is the duty of the uni\nversity to help out the ignorant friend,\nWe believe that if such information\nhad been in the hands of our school\nhoards the errors made in making tht\nlevies for this year and which were\nDrought to our attention at our lasv\nmeeting, would not have been so nu\nmerous.\nPresident Carlyle and other mem\nbers of the university have lent ub\nevery assistance and their help\ngreatly appreciated. We wish to ex\ntend to President Carlyle and the othei\nmembers of the faculty our sincere ap\npreciation; also to Mr. S. E. Hut\nion for the valuable assistance that ht\nhas given us.\nSummarizing our report, we have\nendeavored to point out that:\n(1) The actual amount raised by the\ncounty commissioners over and above\nwhat can be assumed to be an average\nindicator of the cost of county gov\nernment was approximately $13,000;\nthey were justified under the laws con\ntrolling their body in raising said\namount to take care of new expend!\ntures and the deficit at the end of 1912\n(2) The great increase in the\namount of taxes collected during the\npast several years is due largely to\nthe ever increasing amounts being\nvoted by road and school districts,\ncities and villages; the great increase\ncan be attributed very largely to oui\nown initiative rather than to the coun\nty officers.\n(3) • We have attempted to answei\nthe following questions: "Where does\nour money go?" "Are we receiving\nlull value for our money?" "Can we\neduce these expenditures?" "If so\nnow?" in answering our first ques\ntion we fould that for every $100 spent\nfor county purposes during the pas\nthree years $49 thereof went foi\nschools, $24 for roads, and $27 for cur\nent expenses. We have answered tlu\nquestion, "Are we obtaining full valut\ntor our money in the negative am.\nCan we reduce these expenditures" in\nthe affirmative and as to "how" wt\nnave made no specific recommenda\nions. We have endeavored to poin\nout what represents good businest\nmanagement and to show that thest\nprinciples are not being carried out ii\nour public business; and that it it\n•mpossible to use them as long at\n,ve look to the legislature to govern\njur affairs and have our matters o\njusiness management tangled up ii\nquestions of partisan politics.\n(5) We believe that something cat\nje done in the way of placing the mat\n,ers pertaining to our roads upon i\njetter business basis and suggest the\nemployment of a competent roac\njuilder and business manager for tht.\nqandling of our entire road system.\n(6) The cost of educating our chil\nIren is too great; and we believe thaï\nt his cost can be reduced providing the\nmatter is thoroughly studied from a\nousiness point of view.\nRespectfully submitted,\n\' CIVIC COMMITTEE,\nBy F.
