J. Myers, of\nthe Kentucky Experiment Station, and\nDr. D. A. Piatt, of Lexington, came here\nto-day at the request of the Woodford\nCounty Health Board to act with Dr.\nHenry L Casey, of this city, Assistant\nState Veterinarian, in holdingan autopsy\non the carcasses of several cows that died\nyesterday on the farm of Mr. William L.\nGraddy. The cows died of a strange\nmalady that has been fatal to cattle and\nhorses in this section for several months,\nand which has batlltd medical authori\nties. Only animals fed on corn-fodder have\nbeen affected. It was at first believed\nthat death was caused by "smut" or\nblasted ears in the fodder, but practical\ntests made proved that the smut con\ntained nothing poisonous. Another theory\nwas that the stock died from eating quan\ntities of dry food without water or salt,\nbut cattle continued to die that had free\naccess to good water and salt. Probably\n100 head of cows, steers and horses have\ndied from the malady in Woodford Coun\nty alone. Mr. Graddy, at whose sugges\ntion the present investigation is being\nmade, has lost eleven head of cattle.\nFour died on his place yesterday. Two\nweeks ago he lost three head of thorough\nbred Hereford heifers valued at several\nhundred dollars each.\nAt A. J. Alexander\'s Woodhurn Farm\neleven or twelve bead of Shorthorns have\ndied. A number of others have suffered\nlosses of from one to six head of cows or\nhorses. Nor is the strange disease con\nfined to this section. Stock has died in\nlike manner through Indiana, Illinois\nand Missouri.\nThe symptoms exhibited bv animals\naffected indicate cerehro-spinal menin\ngitis, and death ensues within a few\nhours after the attack.\nOne Proposes to Change Congressional Dis\ntrictsRepresentative Alexander\'s\nCommittee Assignments.\nMR.

After shooting out\nthe windows and terrorizing the women\nof the Jailer\'s family, the guards and\nSheriff were compelled to stand aside and\nwork was begun trying to batter down\nthe door with a sledge.\nWhile this was in progress some one\nconcealed across the street, and supposed\nto be the father or some relative of Gas\nkins, opened tire with a shotgun. This\nhad the effect of scattering the mob,\nwhich left as quickly as it came.\nThe mob was made up mostly of boys,\nand the identity of most of them is\nknown. Two persons were shot in the\nmelee.

The Sun\nsays : "If a smooth, business-like stranger comes\nalong and wants to buy your farm you just tell\nhim at once to go \'way back and sit down.\'\nOne of this kind bought a farm over in Boyle\ncounty the other day, and the parties went to\ntown to close the deal. The first payment was\nto be $2,500. The stranger drew his check on a\nMemphis bank for t2,550 and wanted the differ\nence in cash, as he was a little short on expense\nfunds.\' But this \'old haysted,\' being somewhat\nof a business man himself, took the precaution\nto have his banker make inquiries of the Mem\nphis bank before handing over the $50. The\nanswer came promptly and stamped the check\nas utterly worthless. The farmer then went out\nto look for the stranger, who, by the way, had\nenjoyed the hospitality of bis home for quite a\nweek, but he was nowhere to be found, and has\nnot since made bis appearance in tbote parts."\n-\nThe girl is the mother of the woman just as\n"the boy is the father of the man.\'\' The period\nwhen the womanly functions begin is one to be\ncarefully watched and considered. Irregularity\nor derangement at this time may be promptly\nmet and cured by the use of Dr. Pierce\'s Favor\nite Prescription. But neglect at this critical\nperiod may entail years of future suffering.\n"Favorite Prescription" acta directly upon the\nwomanly organs giving tbem perfect vigor and\nabundant vitality. It removes the obstructions\nto health and happiness, and delivers woman\nhood from the cruel bondage of "female weak\nness."\nYou pay the postage. Dr. Tierce gives you the\nbook.
