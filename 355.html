We have a\ngovernment by law and not by\nmobs. Murder and criminal assault\nare punishable by death in this\ntate, and a failure of justice in the\ncase of the latter crime is unknown.\n"The action of the Springseld mob\nwas dastardly, cruel, Inhuman and\ncowardly."\nNegro, and John Hall, another\nwhite man, implicated in the kill\na committee, made a demand on\nthe circus management for damage\nand it was promptly granted.\nOn his visit to Booker T.

Just\nstand back and laugh at him when\nyou see him squandering his money\nfor printers\' ink.

He owned fifty\nyards of calico, three pairs of jeans,\nand a half dozen pairs of boots. He\ncalled this a dry goods store through\na Philadelphia newspaper, and off\nered to sell a pair of socks for 39\ncents. The don\'t-believe-in-advertis\ning just laughed. Young John spent\nS65 with a Philadelphia paper to ad\nvertise just one time, and not less than\n$100 worth of goods.
