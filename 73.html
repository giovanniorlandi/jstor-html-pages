Editor and Manager., Published by the EMPIRE PRINTING COMPANY, SUBSCRIPTION RATES:, One year, by mall - $10.00, Six month*, by mall i _ ? 5.00, Per month, delivered ? 1.00, Entered as second-class matter November 7, 1912. at postotllco at Ju, neau. Alaska, under the Act of March S, 1879., WILSON AND HIS MINORITY., " /, THE DISPATCH attempts to make a point out of the circum, stance that the Democratic administration was voted for;, by a minority of voters of the country. The weakness of, the point is best illustrated by the circumstance that most of, our Presidents have received the votes of a minority of the vot, ers. Lincoln, Hayes, Garfield, Cleveland and Harrison were mi, nority Presidents. Further, most the Republican members, of Congress, since the organization of that party, have been, minority Representatives. Delegate Wickersham is a minority;, Delegate to Congress., However, the Wilson administration represents a plurality\', exceeding 2,000,000?the largest that any President ever receiv, ed except Roosevelt in the 1904 election. And these figures are;, not really representative of the preponderance of sentiment be, hind the Wilson administration, because in the Southern States, the elections are uncontested, and the vote is consequently light., There are several times more votes cast in the most of the South ,, era States in the Democratic primaries than are cast in the gen, eral elections., And still further, it is not speaking by the card to represent, the opposition to President Wilson as a divided Republican vote., The Democratic-Progressive fusion in Pennsylvania and Utah and, the fusion that is being arranged between those parties in Se, attle would indicate that Wilson probably suffered quite as much, as Taft did from the organization of the Progressive party., ABOUT BAD FAITH., THE SKAGWAY ALASKAN accused The Empire of bad faith, because it printed in full the letter from Judge Jennings to, Judge Wickersham?from which the latter quoted what, purported to be extracts?after Judge Wickersham left the city., There could be no bad faith if the letter was correctly print, ed. However- it is three weeks yet before election. The Empire, will gladly print any reply to anything it has said that Dele, gate Wickersham may desire to make, and it wMll give it a wid, er circulation than the thing replied to because its circulation, is larger every day than it was the day before., f "THE ATTITUDE I ADVOCATE.", ACCORDING to Mr. Roosevelt\'s late Kansas pronouncement,, such evil conditions as have been noted in the Colorado, Coal and Iron Company and the New Haven Railroad are, primarily due to the failure of the Nation to "provide the kind, of remedy and to adopt the kind of attitude I advocate." He ex, plains that he advocates "overseeing?or, as our enemies call, it, \'policing\' "?Big Business by the Government.1, Under the law the Department of Justice has done some, pretty effective policing of .New Haven. Under the law the, President has so policed Colorado as to bring peace where civil, war had raged and wholesale ruin had been wrought. Such pol, icing was needed only because of the failure of civil government, in the States concerned to do justice and enforce law. Instead, of ealling for a regeneration of public responsibility in the cen, tres of State and local power, Mr. Roosevelt asks the people to, pin their faith on distant Washington and on some steward of, the public welfare armed by them with a Big Stick., "The attitude I advocate" might do very well in Berlin or Pet, rograd. It is Czarism. It is centralized force. The American, Republic was built upon the plan of popular government, bal, anced powers and personal responsibility. None can be weak, ened without danger or abandoned without disaster. ., % If you want your son to be a Democratic candidate for office, in Alaska name him "Charles." The First Division Democratic, ticket contains the names of Charles E. Bunnell- Charles A. Sul, zer, Charles M. McGrath, and Charles H. Cosgrove. How Casius, F. Cheek and James F. Kennedy happened to get nominations is, a mystery., The Wickersham press feels pained that The Empire did, not show up all the fallacies of Delegate Wickersham\'s speeches, while he was in Juneau. \'Twas impossible. Some space had to, be devoted to living up to the motto: "All the news all the, time.", The speech delivered by Charles A. Sulzer eleven years ago,, printed in another column, should be read. It fits the situation, today. In addition, it serves to give one an idea of the manner, of man whom the Democrats have nominated for Territorial, Senator., The Delegate made such a mess of trying to answer the, proof that he had misrepresented the politics of Charles E. Bun, nell that his friends should credit the ..delay of a day or two, before the publication of the Jennings letter to charity., Then, again, there is that old saw about giving rope. It, might be that the Delegate would have been more discreet if he, had known that he was tied to a post., German aniline products are shut out of the country by, the war, but perhaps there are Southern women still living who, know how to make dyes out of butternut bark., "Comply or close" is a good rule for wireless stations., THE SILVER HORDE, ARE IN THE BAY, SKAGWAY, Oct. 7.?These are the, days of delight for the Skagway lov, ers of salmon fishing, for "the salmon, are in the bay"., Following the run of herring, which, may be seen from any of the wharves, I in countless numbers, Che salmon came, 1 up Into the bay. and "flshln* Is bully", for they take the spoon and when, they strike the fight Is on.

Frederick Von Bernhard came, Into international prominence two, years ago as the author of a book, entitled "Germany and the Next War,", in which, with most startling accu, racy, he prophesied the present strug, gle between Germany and Austria 011, the one hand, and England, Franco, and Russia on the other. He foretold, the abandonment by Italy of the Tri, ple Alliance, pointed out the neces, sity for Germany to strike hard and, quick, so as to crush France, and the, probability that England would block, ade the North sea and the channel, and paralyze German commenrce., Some excerpts from tho book, which, is regarded as an interpretation of, Germany\'s military spirit, follow:, "We are accustomed to regard war, as a curse, and refuse to recognize it, as the greatest factor in the further, ance of culture and power., "This aspiration (peace) is directly, antagonistic to the great universal, laws which rule all life. War is a bio, logical necessity of the first import, ance. Without war, inferior or de, caying races would easily choko the, growth of healthy budding elements, and a universal decadence would fol, low., "War, in opposition to peace, does, | more to arouse national life and to, expand national power than any oth, | er means known to history., "An Intellectual and vigorous nation, can experience no worse destiny than, to be lulled into a Phaecion existence, by the undisputed enjoyment of peace., The United States of America, In June, 1911, championed the ideas of univer, sal peace in order to bo able to de, vote their undisturbed attention to, money-making and the enjoyment of, wealth, and to save the J300.000.000, which they spend on their army and, ? ? ? ? if thev advanco, (further ou this road they will one, day pay dearly for such a policy., "The appropriate and conscious em, ployment of war as a political means, has always led to happy results., "All which other nations obtained, in centuries of natural development?, political union, colonial possessions,, naval power, international trade?was, denied in our nation till quite recent, ly. What wo now wish to attain must, be fought for, and won; against a, superior force of hostile interests and, powers., "England may have to tolerate\' the, rivalry of North America in her im, perial and commercial ambitions, but, the competition of Germany must bo, stopped. If England is forced to fight, America, the German position must, not be such as to force the nations to, help the Americans. Therefore it, must destroy., "There must bo no self deception on, the point that political arrangements, have only a qualified value, that they, are always conducted with tacit res, ervation. Nothing can compel a state, to act contrary to its own interests,, on which those of its citizens depend,, Considerations may arise which art, more powerful than the most honor, able intentions., In one way or another we musi, I square our account with France if w<, I wish for a free hand in our intcrnatlon, I al policy, This is tho first and fore, | most condition of a sound Germai, policy. France must be so complete, ly crushed that she can never agali, come across our path., I "No peoplb is so little qualified ai, the German to direct its own destln, les; to no people is the customar;, liberal pattern so inappropriate as t<, us. ? * ? * Tho German pec, pie have always been incapable o, great acts for the common interes, except ? ? ? under tho leadershi), of powerful personalities, who knov, I how to arouse the entl usiasm of th>, masses, to stir the German spirit ti, its depths, to vivify tho idea of nation, ality, and forco conflicting aspirations, into concentration and union., It is quite a perverted idea that, the time dovoted to military scrvico, deprives economic life of forces which, could have been more appropriately, and more profitably employed \'else, where. These forces are not with, drawn from economic life, but are, trained for economic life., "We have fought in our last groat, wars for our national union and our, position among the powers of Europe; t, we now must decide whether we wish, to develop into and maintain a world, empire, and procure for Gcrmnn spirit, and German ideas that fit recognition, which has been hitherto withheld from, them., "War is orly a moans of attulning, political ends and of supporting moral, .strength., "It was, in my opinion, the most, serious mistake in German policy, that, a final settling of accounts with tho, French Republic was not effected at, a timo when the state of international, affairs -Was favorable and success, might confidontally have been expect, ed. This policy somewhat resembles, the supincness for which England has, herself to blame, when she refused her, assistance to the Southern States in, the American war of secession, and, thus allowed a power to arise in tho, form of tho United States of North, America, which already, although, barely 50 years have elapsed, threat, ens England\'s own position as a world, power., "The soul of our nation is not re, flected in that part of the proas with, its continual dwelling on the neces, sity of upholding pence and its denun, ciation of any bold and comprehen, sive political measure as a policy of, recklessness., "Especially in a state which is so, wholly based on war as the German, Empire the old manly principle of, keeping all our forces on the stretch, must ne ver be abandoned out of def, erence to tho offexninate philosophy, of the day.", WHO IS THE BOSS?, "Who is the Boss, Mr. Brltt?", "No.", "Mr. Seeley?", "No.", "Well, Who is then?", "Why, the customer, of course.", We aro ever at your service., BRITT\'S PHARMACY., Phono 25., SENTIMENT TURNING, TOWARD ADMINISTRATION, ?, That the change in point of view, of the nation since August 1, must bo, of advantage to the party in power, is generally admitted. Lines of at, tack on the administration\'s record,, which has been carefully opened up,, are now completely blocked. Certain, liabilities of the President are now, revealed as assets. A gibe at "watch, ful waiting" today would be likely to, make more Democratic votes than, Republican or Progressive votes. All, criticism of the foreign policy of the, administration is suspended. Mr., Roosevelt has publicly announced an, abandonment of his assault on the, President along that lino., The sufficient answer to criticism, of the foreign policy of the United, States Government is that the Unit, ed States Is at peace with all the, world. Americans prefer the answer, of tho "Inexporlenced" Bryan to the, Japanese ambassador. "There can be, no last word between friends,\' to the, experienced Von Bethmann-Holliweg s, professional sneer at a "scrap of pn, por." The nation must take pride in, the scrupulous observance of the Hay- j, Paunccfote treaty, In the matter of, the canal tolls, now that a great Eur, opean power has inndo a mockery of, the treaty neutralizing Belgium. One, can no longer sneer at "amateur dip, lomatists," In view of Gerard\'s splen, did service at Berlin and Whitiock\'s, masterly roscue of unfortified Brus, sels from the German guns., The country is not likely in the com, ing election to weaken seriously the, President\'s influence either nt home, or abroad. He must remain Presi, dent of the United States throughout, the war period, and in him rests the, world\'s hopes of peace as soon as con, ditions render it advisable for him to, again offer his friendly offices. He, will need the strong and undivided, support of his countrymen in order, that he may speak at the opportune, moment with such prestige that the, powers in conflict will listen to his, counsel.?The Springfield Republican., (Ind.), DON\'T Blame the Flour., If your baking snould turn out bad,, don\'t put the blamo on the flour;, change your coal man.

Thou, sands of men who have been out of, work or on half time are promised ], full time, beginning on Labor Day. i, Orders for coal are pouring into Penn- I, ?ylvania from every port on the globe., The Belgian and Russian coal fields, are affected by the war. which has i, also curtailed the activity of the <, Welch mines. Europe is calling for i, our coal, just as she Is calling for our i, wheat. i, Another cncourvrfing Itom comes i, from Pittsburgh, which reports that, the steel companies there are com, pleting arrangements that are expect, ed to develop a tremendous amount, of actual business out of the wide in, quiry of steel now steadily coming ,, to them from Europe. South America, and other countries. Within forty, eight hours Inquiries had beep re, ceived for semi-finishing steel, total, ing more than 100,000 tons, coming, from England alone., Another cheering note is sounded (, by a New Yorkflispatch which points, to the re-employment of a large num- ,, ber of stevedores and ship laborers ., indicating the gradual return of nor, mal conditions in the commercial, field., All these are rainbow signs show, ing that the flood of business dlstur, bance is beginning to abate. We are, still short of ocean transportation, but, he have got the foreign demand, we, have got the goods to supply It, and, we have the money to get the ships., Under the circumstances, it will be, impossible to\'bottle up our commerce, much longer. Its outward flow has., In fact, already been resumed to some I, extent. But It will not be long bo, fore it will be represented by a great, armada of peaceful ships conveying ,, to Europe and South" America the food \', and the industrial products which they, can get nowhere else.?Baltimore Sun., STATEMENTS BY TWO, LEADERS OF CANADA, ?+?, By Sir Robert Borden, Conservative, Leader., "The men of Canada, who are going, to the front, are going as free men,, voluntarily enlisting as free men in a, free country. They are coming for, ward voluntarily for the purpose of, serving this Dominion and this?em, pire in a thne of peril., "I am sure that every man in Can, ada will say amen to that statement, uttered la the British House of Com, mons. I am glad indeed to listen to, the words of my ;right Honorable, friend with regard to our attitude to, the German people. We have abso, lutely no quarrel with the German, people.", By Sir Wilfrid Laurfcr, Liberal Leader., "It is our duty, monj pressing on, us than all other duties at once, on, this first day of debate in a Canadian, Parliament to let Great Britain know,, to let the friends and foes of Great, Britain know, that there is in Canada, but one mind, and one heart, and that, all Canadians stand behind the moth, er country., "If my words can be heard beyond, the walls of this house, in the province, from whence I come, among the men, whose blood flows in my own veins,, I should like them to remember that, in taking their places in the ranks of, the Canadian army to fight for the, cause of the allied nations, a double, honor rests upon them, as the very, cause for which they are called up, on to fight will be to them doubly, sacred.", RINK NEWS., Skating every evening at Jaxon\'s, rink. (???) t, SADDEST WAR FEATURE, ^ IS THE NAMES, The saddest part of the European, var to us people over here Is the at, ompt to pronounce the names of the, jlaces where the battles are going, >n. Some of thorn remind one of the, itory of tho farmer who was looking, it a camel for tho first time In hlB, lfe, and, doubting his own sense of, light, declared that there warn\'t no, tuch animal. When wo come to a, >lace called Przemysl we can only, ?egret, no matter how our sympathies, lo, that the Austrlans were ever so, \'oolish as to fortify It and keep the, Russians so- long monkeying around, t. It Is hoped if they do take It that, hey will mete out to It the fate of, 5t. Petersburg., Two Irish soldiers were wounded, ibout a month ago during the fighting, it Compeigne and when they were ta, ien to Paris they told the doctors they, received their wounds fighting like, ;ho devil at Copenhagen and from, this probably came the story that the, Danish army was being mobilized. j, London Punch once when asked for], :ho best advice for people about to, et mnrited answered with word"don\'t", md same advlco holds good when one, Is about to pronounce some of the, names of the battlefields. Sometimes, those names are bad enough but are, sweet simplicity itself when compared, to the way they come over tho wires., One came yesterday spelled Tslng, chudufuklae but the linotype machine, bucked and to get the paper out In, time the work of art had to be Os, lerized., The funny thing about all this is, that some people are willing to pro, nounco Paris just as it Is spelled, but, If you pronounce Bruges, Vosges, Lelge, Oise, Verdum, St. Qucntln and the, rest as they look to you one is in, danger of being put down as an Ig, noramus. We do not pronounce France, or Paris as the French pronounce, them so why In the name of all that\'s, holy should we be expected to pro, nounce Amiens as if we had a cold In, the nose., T J .?*n1 (a ni*nnAtinPAH, liioit\'u, r i tcui j 01 10, something liko Pshrashl tho encyclo, pedia\'tells us and If we cannot pro, nounce it the way it is spelled we, surely can\'t pronounce It the way it, ought to be spelled unless we go out, and get a Jag on., A Frenchman went to Nome some, time ago and one of the Nomeltes, let loose some of his French but the, Frenchman apologizes because he, couldn\'t understand him and explained, that ho never had a chance to learn, Eskimo., As most of the corresponding let, ters of the languages have different, lualities, so to speak, it would bo a vain, task to try to pronounce all tho names, of tho countries correctly. Even right, at our elbows we have a man who, spells his name Villa and pronounces, it Viya, while Huerta is something like, Woerta., As a matter of fact one cannot spell, in English as they are pronounced, such words as Bruges, Vosgcs, and, others. They nro pronounced as a, free and intox^patcd American pro, nounces the word lose. It is not, Brushe or Voshe nor is it Bruzhe or, Vozhe exactly but a sort of a cross be, tween both. But then one of these, days the Germans may reitre to their, own country and we shall be quite at, home pronouncing Pfalzburg, Refnoh, onbdeh and little matters of that kind., ? Seward Gateway., THE PRESIDENT\'S GOOD COUNSEL, President Wilson spoko a fino word, looking forward to tho time when the, United States may have the oppor, tunity to serve the world as the one, great neutral power, the friend of all, the nations in the European war. It, is evident that the intemperate ex, pression of partisanship at this time, would impair the acceptability of this, government as the final instrument of, mediation.?Kansas City Times., SPANISH WAR VETS, SUPPORT PRESIDENT, ?+?, LOUISVILLE, Ky. ? The veterans, if the Spanish-American War, who, have been in annual session herer, adopted resolutions approving the for, eign policy of President Wilson\'s Ad, ministration. The Courier Journal?, jver which Marse Henry Watterson so, lbly presides?said editorially in com, menting on this remarkable tribute to, the President:, "It is an axiom of American politics, that there is no such thing as defeat, ing a War President. By stres* of \'cir, cumstances over which he had no con, trol,\' Mr. Wilson has become a War, President. By his control of circum, stances, which were nothing if not, stressful, ?Mr. Wilson now occupies an, jven more strongly intrenched posi, tion as a Peace President. His doublo, aold on the confidence and loyalty of, the American people Is accuratelj\', voiced in the following resolutions, idopted yesterday by the Spanish, (\\merican War Veterans assembled, lere in annual encampment:, " \'Whoreas the members of this as, sociation have seen, ddrlng the past, wo years, the gradual development of j, :ondittons in a neighboring republic, vhich for a time appeared to many, ;o require an army of occupation and, :he possible sacrifice of thousands of, ives for its solution, and have further, seen the maelstrom of war sweop al, nost every other Important military, jower in the world into its awful vor, ex. and, " \'Whereas id spite of these pitfalls, vhich have beset the path of our pros, >erity, we now (see our country stand, ng calm and secure (while other coun, ries are in tho throes of the horrors", >f war)?at peace with all men, with, >ur citiens pursuing their ordinary, vocations and no shadow of fear fall, ng across our homos; and, " \'Whereas this association believes, hat this proud position has been, achieved through the wisdom, patience,, foresight and statesmanship of the, President of theso United States, and, " \'Whereas this association realizes, rhat the power of the nation\'s Execu, tive in this crisis depends upon the, support of the people of this nation ^, and that it 1b the duty of overy pa- ?, triotic body so to uphold and support, him; therefore bo it, " \'Resolved, That tho United Spanish !, War Veterans, a.\'body composed of [, men peculiarly fitted to appreciate tho ?, blessings of peace from their actual ), and personal experience of the horrors ?, of war, desire to pledge their loyal J, and unswerving support to tho Presl- ?, dent of these United Slates and to urge j, all citizens of this country to stand ?, solidly behind the Chief Executive In !, theso trying times. 1, "Mr. Wilson yet has work to do.

I desire to tako this op, portunity of congratulating and thank, ing those gentlemen who have been, instrumental by their unceasing agi, tation. in bringing about this conven, tion. They have been untiring In their, efforts to better the conditions of our, people, and to advnuco tho welfare of, this great country. Their work is ap, preciated. I thank them for this, priv, ilege. ? and am glad to holp them in, every way in may power., .Mr. Chairman, as you have so well, said, government has ever been the, great concern of the human race, since, the dawn of civilization. Greek. Ro, man, Teuton and American have all, struggled for its preservation. Good, government should be the first thought, of an honest and intelligent people., Our welfare, our character, our lib, erties and our happiness, depend upon, our laws and our government There, are many forms of govrenment. and, our forefathers established on this, hemisphere a form of government that, has been\' tested by a century and a, quarter of time and has not been, found wanting but ha3 proved to be, a boon not only to the descendantn, of those who instituted it, but in all, mankind., As has been so well said, it is a, government of, by and for the people, ?not of any special interests, but of, the people! It was founded upon the, eternal principle of equal rights to, all, of special privileges to none., It guarantees. Mr. Chairman, life, li, berty, and tho pursuit.of "happiness., It was planted and has grown rich,, powerful, and happy under the God, given doctrine that government?de, rives its just power from the consent, of the governed. Are we then, fellow, delegates, asking too much when wo, claim our birthright?when we petition, for that which has made this nation, what it is today??that which has ad, ded each bright star to the Union, and, has made the American people the, most enlightened, tho most prosperous,, the most free and happy people on the, face of the earth today?, .-MU9IU1 IB illicu 1U rvcijr oruau iui, that measure of self-government em, bodied in the resolution now before, this convention. Her population, her, intelligence, her industries, wealth,, and commerce, her transportation fa, cilities, her ambitions, pioneering and, progressive spirit, are equal If not, superior to those of almost every oth, er district that the Congress has cre, ated into a Territory. We are ask, ing nothing new. my friends; we are, petitioning for no strange fallacy. We, are simply protesting against actual, wrongs and asking that the Congressi, follow the thirty glorious precedent^, It has already made. For our author, ity we can go back as far as tho, landing of the pilgrims on the rocky, Xew England coast, or to the rule of, the-first white man on the shores of, Virginia. For our Justification we, may plead every act of American rev, olution, and for our proof we may, point with pride to the creation of, ever}- Territory in the Union., Mr. Chairman, to deny that the peo, ple of Alaska are fit for self-govern, ment. is either an insult to the intel, ligence of the people of Alaska, *or, else that of the pioneering men and, | women who were the builders of the, I present great American Republic. As, long ago as 1672 the general court, I of the colony of Massachusetts re, I solved: "That the acts of navigation, j are an invasion of the rights of the, . subjects of his majesty. In this col, ! opy, they not being represented in, j the parliament." The principle that, i people must not be taxed except by, ? their own representatives has ever, been, and is I hope today, the funda, mental princjple of our liberty. We, can stand taxation without represen, tation perhaps; we can submit to un, just and unreasonable laws; but, Mr., Chairman, we are not willing to be, deprived of our sacred heritage as\', I free men, nor to submit without a, protest, to tho degradation of bolng, government outcasts. At lenst the, people in the part of Alaska that I, come from are not clamoring to bo, permitted to remain In political-bond, age., Mr. Chairman, I have been a resi, dent of Alaska for some time, and I, have made It a point to ascertain tho, wishes in this regard of all those, ( with whom I have come In contact;, and I say to this convention that not, only the people of my own vicinity,, out yonder on the great West CoaHt,, are unanimously in favor of Territorial, government for Alaskn., Mr. Chairman. I came to Alaska, from the metropolis of the nation.
