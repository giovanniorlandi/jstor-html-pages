"All races have\ntheir good women, and it is good that\nyour race has such a probation officer,"\nhe said. In concluding, Judge Foster\nsaid: ."You\'re an intelligent, learned\nman.

Hogan.\nThe colored people of Ohio, always\nIn the front rank of progressive\nachievement, will set n new example\nthis year for other commonwealths by\na specific act of forslghted political\nsagacity. The situation came about\nIn this way: For a uumber of years\nthe active colored Republicans have\nmade an effort to Impress on the\nminds of the Ktate officials the Impor\ntance of Riving some Intelligent col\nored men of the state u position above\nthe ordinary messenger or porter\'s Job.\nwhich has been their iwrtlon for "loy\nalty to the cause and for services ren\ndered." The usual utereotyped promises were\nmade by candidates, and the glad hand\nand fetching smile were given until\nthey were elected. Then the victorious\npatriots would suddenly nnd sullenly\nforget what had transpired prior to\nth first Tuesday In November. But\nthey would again become affected with\nthe same awakening and willingness\nabout election time, nnd the faithful\nOhio colored voters would march to\nthe polls and "put the cross under the\neagle."\nNearlv two vears ago there was\nelected to the office of attorney general\nin Ohio Tlmothr S. flouan. a Demo\ncrat, by nationality Irish and religion\nCatholic. Stirrly then Is n combina\ntion from which the average colored\ncitizen would expect little. But hero\nHognn fooled them. Having been a\nman who built his way from the bot\ntom round and with a keen apprecia\ntion of Scott\'s "A man\'s a man for a\nBOX. X.EBOT H. OODUA.K.\nthat." Mr. Hogan Bet about to sur\nround himself with capable assistants.\nHe Is the legal adviser of a great state\nof over 4,000,000. and be must have\nefficiency above oil else.\nHe was elected on a partisan plat\nform, but he Is the attorney general of\nall the people. So Mr. Hogan thought\nto himself after he bad settled Into tho\nroutine of bis official duties that Inas\nmuch an the colored peoplo form, a\nconsiderable portion of the Ohio popu\nlation they should have representation\nIn his office. He said If Ohio could\nfurnish him the right man be would\nappoint the man as one of his as\nsistants. Well, after the Ohloaus bad rubbed\ntheir eyes nnd saw that they were not\ndreaming and that Mr. nognn was not\njoking Attorney Lcroy n. Godman\nwas selected and wn forthwith ap\npointed by Mr. Hognn as special coun\nsel at a salary of $1,800 per year as a\nstarter, the first time n colored -man\never held such an office In the state of\nOhio. Mr. Godman Is a graduate of\nOhio State university nnd Howard\nuniversity law school nnd served for\ntwo years with Judzo Safer, federal\nJudge. He Is making good.\nSo on lhp theory that "a bird In the\nhand Is worth two In the bush." the\ncolored people of Ohio are going to\nvote to retain Attorney General T. S.\nHogan.

A measure of far\nreaching cousequences to the future of\ntnaterlul aid to public education Is em\nbodied In senate hM No. 3. now wait\nIns m-:lon on the calender ot the\nViii.e-l States senate. The bill was\nIntroduced by Senator Carroll S. Page\nof Vermont and Is entitled "A bill to\nco-operate with the states In encour\naging Instruction In agriculture, the\ntrades and Industries and home eco\nnomics In secondary schools, in main\ntaining Instruction In these vocational\nsubjects In state normal schools, in\nmaintaining extension departments in\nstate colleges of agriculture and me\nchanic arts and to appropriate money\nand regulate Its expenditure." As orig\ninally drawn by Senator Page, tho bill\ncontains the following provision:\nSection 1 That In states where separata\nschools and departments of schools and\ncollects aro maintained for tho colored race\ntho allotment of money Jor the encour\nagement of Instruction In tho aforesaid\nvocations shall be In proportion to the\npopulation or the two races respectively,\nand whether the districts for agricultural\nsecondary schools for the two races aro\ncoterminous or not coterminous their to\ntal number shall be determined by the\nnumber or districts permissible under this\nact.\nThe bill as reported from the com\nmittee on agriculture nnd forestry\ndoes not contain this provision. The\nprovision which directs that an equi\ntable portion of the moneys appropriat\ned shall go to the colored schools\nwas stricken out at the suggestion of\nSenators Hoke Smith of Georgia. El\nlison Smith of South Carolina and John\nL. Bankhead of Alabama. It is of the\ngreatest liniwrtance that this provi\nsion be reinserted In tbe bill before it\npasses the senate.\nThe state schools of the higher grade\nfor Negroes In the states represented\nby the senators objecting to section 3\nof the Page bill get practically no sup\nport from these states, but are being\nsupported out of the Morrill fund from\nthe United States, and even this Is not\nequitably distributed. In proof of this\nstatement the following figures, taken\nfrom the nnnual report or the experi\nment stations for ttfe year 1909, are\ncited In relation to state schools for\nNegroe nnd white. In Alnlmuiu. Geor\ngia and South Cnroliiin. the three states\nwhose senator ulijei-t ti the distribu\ntion of puli\'lr fimiN "in intortlon to\nthe population nt Hie iwo nice."

Georgia received from\nthe treasury of the Tnlted States in\naid of colleges of agriculture and me\nchanic arts $35,000 In UXM. \'The Ne\ngroes share of the money. If distrib\nuted "In proiHjrtlon to the population of\nthe two races." would have been\n$1G.100.\nWhat he receives in lieu of the land\nscript fund of 1Sfl2 Is $S00 In Geor\ngia, therefore, in l\'.Hiy the Negro should\nhave received of funds of national\nsource $24,100. He actually received\nbut $19.GCti. Georgia maintains eleven\ncongressional industrial high schools\nfor white people at public expense, but\nnot one for colored people. The United\nStates government spent $11,000 for\nagricultural experiment stations In\nGeorgia in 1909. Practically none of It\nTvas expended In the Interest of colored\npeople. There are In Georgia seventy\ntwo federal agents stimulating agricul\ntural Interests among the white farm\ners and only two among Negro farm\ners. ,\nThese facts and figures tell thelr\'own\nstory. Prom them it can readily be\nqpen that section 3 Is a very Important\nprovision of Senator Page\'s bill for the\nNegro and ought to be reinserted when\nthe bill comes up for consideration on\nthe floor of the senate. It will not be\ninserted unless public sentiment shall\nmake itself felt to this effect The col\nored people of the country and espe\ncially those in the south should become\nactive among themselves and among\nthe white friends of the race io and\nout of congress to insure the reinser\ntion of section 3 in the Page bill.\nBaltimore Conference Delegates.\nAmong the delegates from the Balti\nmore conference to the general con\nference of the A.

The\nappointment of the committee is based\non the fact that the school has now j\ngrown to Htirb proportions that its\npresent facilities are utterly inadequate \'\nto the future enlarged growth that\'ls\nconfidently expected Any plan for re\nmoval would contemplate the sale of\nthe present valuable site and the erec\ntion of the most eligible site available\non the campus ot n modern, up to date\nbuilding, with large nsembly room\nand lecture-ball, greatly enlarged li\nbrary space to meet the needs of the\ngrowing library und other needed facil\nities.

The more ronomiral we can make\ngas ranges the more they will be" used.\nOur "Composite" Gas Ranges\nInclude Fifty Types Made. For Us by\nTen Leading Range Manufacturers\nEvery one built to our specifications and specially\nequipped with all the modern features. "Composite"\nranges are sold by certain hardware dealers with\nwhom we have made special arrangements in every\ndistrict also si all of our branch stores and at our\nsalesroom in the Peoples Gas Building down-town.\nIn the latter, winch Is the largest and finest salesroom\nof its Idod in the world, we display -all fifty styles\nside by side.
