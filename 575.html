As a rule mass meetings\nheld in Forsyth to take initial steps\ntoward giving a Fourth celebration are\nnot exceedinly large, but as has been\nnoted that when the day comes around\nthe celebration is big, the people are\nglad and the crackers and the rockets\nmake noise and illumine the firmament\njust the same.\nClarence Lane, who was elected\nchairman of the previous meeting, pre\nsided, and after the objects of the as\nsembly had been stated, the work of\npermanent organization was taken up,\nresulting in the election of Mr. Lane\nas chairman, M. M. Thornton, treas\nurer and Vernie Beeman secretary\'.\nAfter some discussion everyone pres\nent heartily concurred that it was none\ntoo early to work up enthusiasm and\nstart the ball rolling for a rousing\ncelebration. In the meantime, however\na finance committee, consisting of\nElmer Holt, T. J. Thompson, M. M.\nThornton, Chas. Bailey and Bert Cole\nman, which had been chosen at Mon\nday evening\'s meeting, had waited on\nour business men and received liberal\nencouragement.\nDr. G. H. Klein, who has heretofore\ndemonstrated his ability to manipulate\nthe crowds on previous celebrations,\nwas chosen as marshal of the day,\nand the arrangement committee em\npowered to procure for him a "cariboo"\nfor his use on the Fourth.\nThe chair appointed Bert Coleman,\nElmer Holt and Vernie Beeman to\ndraw up an outline of the committees\n•to be appointed. This done, he se\nlected the following gentlemen to serve\nas chairman with the power to appoint\nassistants as they saw fit:\nFinance—Elmer Holt.\nReception—Jos. Choisser.\nDecoration— H. D. Huff.\nHorseracing— M. M. Thornton.\nBaseball—Tom Butler.\nField Sports—Bert Coleman.\nIndian (to communicate with Crow\nag-ency officials for the purpose of pro\ncuring a band of Crows to take part\nin the celebration)--E.

Huff has alreaily heard from\nAgent Edwards of the Crow agency,\nand not less than 125 Crow Indians\nwill be here to take part In the cele\nbration. These Indians are a very de\nsirable people to participate in such\nfestivities and this will prove a great\nfeature of the program. They will be\nsupplied with provisions while here,\nand horse races and foot races will be\narranged for their benefit.\nThe members of the various com\nmittees have already taken hohl, and\nthere is no doubt that they will all\n■\n!\n%\n£3\n—\nMcCormick\nWp, mowers\nlit binders\nS ANO RA k es\n\'\nK > are the best.\nBAILEY & TERRETI\nA\nCurry a Complete\nStock of these Im\nplements: in fact.\nEverything for\nRanch and Ranife\nWECAN PLEASE YOU\nr\n—\nï\nYJ.\nn\n\'-s\'\n!\nn\nsät\n\'V\nWB BÊ a*» *3 aCSTtfr jSSBMHHfi ^c.Qûi» 3 3BK *vK-J I\nhave interesting and comprehensive re\nports to make at the meeting tomorrow\nevening.\nKft\'cct» ol\' Hay Feeding.\nAll through the great northwestern\nrange states there is a tendency to ef\nfect a radical change in methods. De\nvastation of the range by overstocking\nis a potent cause, says the Chicago\nLive Stock World. Such extensive\noperators as the Lake-Toomb company\nhave decided that there is no longer an\nopportunity for profit on the open\nrange and are leasing pastures irl In\ndian reservations with the avowed in\ntention hereafter not only to do their\nfeeding behind fences but to put up\nhay for winter feeding. Notable ex\namples are C. K. Howard, president\nof the South Dakota Cattlegrowers\'\nassociation, and Captain J. T. Brown,\npresident of the Montana Cattlegrow\ners\' association, both extensive oper\nators. They are purchasing land,\nputting it under ditch, and seeding to\nalfalfa with the intention of feeding\nthe tails of their herds after the tops\nhave been shipped to market.\nBig outfits are one by one dropping\nout of the race, leaving the field to\nmen who adapt themselves to chang\ning conditions.\nThe northwest is pre-eminently\nsuited to the growth of hay, and its\nproduction will increase the output of\nstock and also regulate it. Instead of\na flood of grass cattle during the pres\nent shipping season from the range,\nmuch of it of inferior quality, those\nnot well finished will be retained and\nfed on hay. A better quality of cattle\nwill be used and breeding carried on,\nespecially by the small rancher.\nPerhaps the root crop of the range\ncountry will yet be a factor in solving\nthe feeding problem. In Manitoba,\nwhere the live stock interest is annu\nally assuming larger proportions, the\nsiol is already extensively used, al\nthough corn cannot be matured in that\nlatitude. But alfalfa is the crop, par\nexcellence, for the range states and\nwherever it can be raised its growers\nwill amass wealth.\nGovernor J. K. Toole Tuesday is\nsued a proclamation in accordance\nwith the resolution passed at a recent\nmeeting of the state board of sheep\ncommissioners, making it compulsory\nupon sheep inspectors to dip all sheep\nbrought into the state, twice, and keep\nthe animals in quarantine ninety days.\nHeretofore it has been largely discre\ntionary with the inspectors whether\nthey dipped the sheep twice and kept\nthem in quarantine the required time,\nand the sheep commissioners asked\nthe governor to issue the proclamation 1\nto compel the inspectors to follow the\ndirect : ons of the state board.\nStand hike a Stone Wall\nBetween your children and the tor\ntures of itching and burning, eczema,\nscaldhead or other skin diseases.

This is an increase of 1,000,\n000 pounds over the previous week,\nwhen the sales amounted to 2,942,000.\nThis paper says:\nA number of mills have been repre\nsented in the market, including several\nlarge Philadelphia mills. The latter\nhaving been conspicious in the buying\nand have taken relatively more than\nthe other big concerns, which have\nbought but very few large lines. The\nsmaller-sized mills have also been rep\nresented in the market, and while their\nindividual purchases are not large,\nthey have manifested decidedly more\ninterest in wool, all of which tends to\nshow that before long there may be a\nlively business in progress.\nIn the interior wools are being taken\nas fast as they come off" the sheep\'s\nback, and every house is operating on\nthe same high basis. In Idaho prac\ntically every clip offered has been\nsold. Utah and Wyoming have been\ncleaned up as fast as the sheep are\nshorn. On.Monday of this week, the\nbuying fever is reported to have broken\nout afresh, and in Idaho as 13>sc has\nBeen paid for wool, costing 48c clean,\nlanded. Last year the same wool was\nbought on the basis of 40@42c. In\nTexas prices are especially high.\nEight months\' wool have sold at I3\'i\n@14/^c, and twelve months\' at 15c and\neven I5>£c, costing at least 50c clean.\nIt is estimated that Boston has taken\n80(œ85 per cent of the clip which has\nthus far come off the sheep\'s back.\nThe demand in the local market the\npast week has run quite largely to fine\nand fine medium terril ries, fine Aus\ntralian and domestic fleeces, notably\ndelaine and No. 1 wools. There has\nbeen a pretty fair demand for coarse\nwool also. Philadelphia houses took\na fair amount of Ohio xx and about\n300.000 pounds of Nevadas Wyomings,\nmostly the former at a clean cost of 50c.\nAnother concern took about 400,000\npounds of fine Australian, and still\nanother purchased about 300,000\npounds of South American. The for\neign wools are selling at prices which\nare lower than those at which they\ncan be imported, This especially true\nof Australian wools whicii arestrength\nening all the time on the other side.\n\\\\ hile prices are no higher on Austra\nlians here, it is of course easier to sell\nat the asking figure of a few weeks\nago.\nThe demand for territories has de\ncidedly improved and some good sized\nlines have been sold. The sales were\nalmost wholly of old wools and were\ntaken at low prices as holders have\nbeen anxious to get these wools out of\nthe way. Scoured wools also have\nbeen moved in some instances at con\ncessions. Among the transactions or\nthe week were sales of 50,000 pounds\nof fine Dakotas at about 45c, clean,\n200.000 pounds of good staplç Montana\ngrading fine medium at 45t«47c, 100 ,\n00° pounds fine Nevada at 15a* 17c, in\nthe grease for staple wools, 50,000\npounds of fine Nevadas and Wyomings\nthe former being- taken at about ,50c,\nand the latter at 47c. Fine wool is the\nstrongest item in the whole list; but\nfine medium clothing is inclined to be\neasy. We should quote fine medium\nclothing at 42(«44c; fine clothing at\n45(ft48c; and strictly fine, choice staple\nwool at 50c. The foregoing sales were\nall of old wools. Scarcely anything\nhas yet been done in the new wools,\nalthough we hear of one sale of new\nmedium Utah at 17c in the grease.\nMedium territories sell here at 38(rt40c\nclean.\nContinued sales are reported in Wy\noming at 13yi (<el4c. The Taylor clip\nit will be remembered, soit! several\ndays ago at the latter quotation. Some\nwools of heavier shinkage sold at 12\'ic.\nOne clip of 170,000 pounds sold at\nCasper at 13,\'^c. Another clip was\nconsigned to a Chicago house at an\nadvance of ll\'ic.\nOBJECTS TO POLITICS.\nStute Superintendent Would Elimin\nate Politic» From School Sy»tem.\nIn an address issued to the voters of\nthe state, W. W. Welch, state superin\ntendent of public instruction, apneals\nfor the absolute elimination of politics\nfrom the present school system. He\nbelieves that all the present county\nsuperintendents should be re-elected.\nIn his address Mr. Welch says:\n"The educational advancement of\nthe different counties of the state is\ndue in a great measure to ^the energy\nand skill displayed by the county sup\nerintendents in the management.of the\nschools.\n"While I view the county superin\ntendency as one of the strongest ele\nments of the entire educational system,\nin results accomplished it produces\nonly a fraction of what it might with\nbut a slight change. Greater waste\nis not found in the entire educational\nsystem, than that which arises from\nthe frequent changes in this office.\n"Usually new superintendents prove\nof little service to school boards during\nthe first year. In fact they will have\ndone well if during the first year they\nlearn the strength and weaknesses of\nthe teachers, and the conditions exist\ning or surrounding the different schools\nof the county. This knowledge is es\nsential before the superintendent can\nintelligently and best aid the school\nboards in their work.\n"Hence I earnestly appeal to the\ncitizens and voters of the state of Mon\ntana to use all honorable means in\nyour power for the re-election of the\npresent corps of county superintendents\nwithout reference to their political af\nfiliations. The supreme fact should\nnot be overlooked that the interests of\nthe state are indisolubly bound up\nwith the interests of the children, that\nthese interests are too vast and sacred\nto be entangled with political matters,\nand that they demand for their protec\ntion and promotion the very best of\nteaching supervision."\nWhen you wake with a bad taste in\nyour mouth, go at once to the Forsyth\nDrug Store and get a free sample of\nChamberlain\'s Stomach and Liver\nTablets. One or two doses will make\nyou well. They also cure biliousness,\nsick headache and constipation. *\nCOMBINE BROKEN.\nBuyer» ol\' Wool Arc Given a threat\nFright.\nWoolbuyers who are operating in\nthe western states appear to be at •\ntempting to run a gigantic bluff on the\ngrowers. Montana\'s clip is not ready\nfor the market yet, but will be within\nthe next six or eight weeks, and the\ngrowers of this state may profit by the\nexperiences of their Idaho brethren.\nThe dispatches from Idaho are to\nthe effect that some lively wool sales\ntook place there, and about 2,300,000\npounds changed hands in one day at\nprices ranging from 12 to 13 cents.\nThe sales, however, were not made\nuntil after the woolbuyers\' clique had\nbeen given a good scare. This is the\nway it happened, according to a Boise\ntelegram:\n"The buyers who have been sta\ntioned here for several weeks were\nquietly resting on their oars, having it\nis alleged, entered into an agreement\nto entertain each other and let the\ngrower cultivate a willingness to ac\ncept lower prices than they were ask\ning. This stopped sales, and for two\nweeks or more there has been no\nmovement.\n"Monday night some men entirely\nstrange to this field drooped in. These\nmen were representing houses that\nhave not been represented in the sec\ntion. Before breakfast one of them\nhad taken a 200,000 pound clip at bet\nter than 12 cents. News of the sale\ngot out as soon as the clique of buyers\ngot aboard, and after comparing notes\nthe old stagers fourni their works had\nbeen stormed, and that they would\nhave to move rapidly if they were to\nget wool. The news was flashed up\nand down the road to those hanging\naround other places, and all hands\nstarted out to get wool. 1\n"The tales of that had been sung so\nlong were dropped,and every man was\nscrambling for wool. As a result 2,»\n200,000 pounds changed hands at\nBoise, Mountain Home, Caldwell, Pay\nette and Weiser. The price for the\nbest clip was 13 cents, the average be\ning 12. Heretofore 12 cents was the\nbest jn ice talked about for the very\nchoisest wool in the market.\nSeuator Clark on Nlio<l<ly Bill.\nSenator Clark introduced in the sen\nate the bill previously introduced by\nRepresentative Grosvenor in the house\nproviding for the federal inspection\nand the taxation of mixed woolen goods\nand the proper marking of the same.\nThis is known as the anti-shoddy\nbill and is intended to prevent the sale\nof mixed goods as genuine woolen\nfoods. The bill provides that the per\ncentage of shoddy or other adulterant\nshall be tagged on the goods.\nThe house committee oil ways and\nmeans have commenced hearings on\nthis bill. Senator Warren, Wyoming,\nappeared before the committee and\nmade an argument in favor of the pas\nsage of the bill. Senator Warren con\ntended that the public should be pro\ntected against the deception in use in\nclothing as well as in use in articles of\nfood. The hearings will be continued\non the bill and a favorable report is\nlooked for.\nRead the Nlows and keep posted.', 'ROSEBUD COUNTY NEWS.\nPUBLISHED EVERY THURSDAY\nVERNIE H.

The white-haired\nold man looked appealingly about the\nroom, and from long habit, put his\nhand out, but, quickly recovering him\nself, and glancing uneasily at the mag\nistrate, he brought forth n grimy old\nbag and counted out pennies, nickels,\ndimes and quarters until he had paid\nh» fine.

Cincinnati Commer\n• Anything. |\nctal tribune gives\nthe following pertinent instance: At I\none time I was treasurer of the church j\ntrustees, and had the temporal affairs |\nin my hands. During my incumbency\n1 dea.t with a minist er who never asked\nfor money, who never for eight years\never asked me a thing about the money\naffairs. At one time I spoke to him\nabout it, and he told me an experience\nsomething out of the ordinary. "In\nmy early days," he said, "I was sta\ntioned at a small church near Zanes\nviLe. \'Ihe salary was meager, but, as\nthere were but two, it was sufficient.\nAt the end of the year, however, my\nwife and myself found, after taking nil\naccount of stock, that we were in debt\nto several of the little stores in sums\nthat aggregated say $50. To both of\nus at the same time there came the !\ninjunction: \'Owe no man anything.\' !\nihere, almost on bonded knees, we\nresolved to pay that debt forthwith at\nany sacrifice, and never again while\nwe lived to charge even a penny nor\nto contract a debt of any form." The\nsainted man went on: "We were re\nceiving about $35 a month. We had\nplenty- of m-eal. a little smoked meat\nand enough potatoes to last us. On\nthose, with milk from a neighbor\'s cow\nand a few donations, we lived through\nJanuary and February in perfect hap\npiness. By the first of March every\ncent of the debt was paid, and that\nended it. From that day to this we\nhave never gone into debt for any\nthing, and, in addition, we have made\nit a rule to save something every year."\nI need not say that this twain never\nneeded to ask aid from the sustentatiou\nfund of the church in their last years.\nThey had enough and to spare, and\nwhen the husband went to his rest his\nend was serene.

The\nnerves of teeth have frequently to be\nkilled and the teeth then often turn\nblack. If they are in the front of the\nmouth they make a considerable dis\nfigurement, and in the past this could\nonly be corrected by capping them\nwith porcelain or with gold. But now,\naccording to the l\'hiladeljihia Record,\nthey may be bleached to the whiteness\nof snow. Little holes are bored in\nthem and the bleaching solution is in\njected, a small quantity at a time. The\nfirst application makes the black\ntooth\'s edges pale.
