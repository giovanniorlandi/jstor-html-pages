        <pre>['; J VOLUME 23\nTOLEDO, LINCOLN COUNTY, OREGON, FRIDAY, JULY 2d, 1915\nNUMBER 20\nNewport.\nMrs. Wm. McWillis staved\n, . -v. " . "\nover night In Newport while on\nher way to Waldport to visit the\nold Jiome. She had been stay\ning with her daughter, Mrs.\nNorm Holgate, who lives at Cul-\ndesac, Idaho. Mrs. McWillis Is\nnow 69 years old. She. with her\nHusband, filed on school land at\nBay View September, 1872,\nwhere she has lived most of her\nlife. Members of the family\nstill own the farm. William Mc\nWillis died in 1887. Since that\ntime she has made her home\nwith her children at the old farm\non the beautiful Alsea bay.-\' Mrs.\nMcWillis Is the mother of ten\nchildren, all living except one,,\nwhich died In infancy. Mrs. Mc\nWillis was the first white woman\nto settle on the Alsea bay. At\nthat time the Alsea Indian res\nervation was still kept up and\nSamuel Case was the sub-agent\nand he had about three bunded\nIndians under his care. In 1876\nthese Indians were removed to\nSiletz and the Alsea reservation\nwas open for settlement. Where\nWaldport now stands was an old\nIndian village and through the\'ment school and .Mrs. Walker\nwooas tnere tne ground was\ncovered with Indian graves and\nrelics. The Indians buried their\ndead in canoes and the canoes\nwere left on top of the ground.\nIn these canoes were placed\neverything that belonged to the\ndead, his gun, his squaw and\nsometimes large sums of money\nand other valuable things, espec\nially if the dead was a chief or a\nprincess. It is said that in pass\ning over these grounds in the\nshade of the evening you could\nalmost hear the sound of the\nwar-whoop and the cry and song\nof the women as they chanted\n- the death dirge over the spirits\nof their departed friends. It\nwould make the\' cold chills run\nup your back to hear them. But\nnow -these things have passed\naway and now the beautiful\nlittle city of Waldport has sprung\nup and, where forty years ago\nthe place was occupied by the In\ndian and his dog, it is now the\nabode of a happy communi\nity enjoying the blessings of\n\'a high state of civil\nization., The most progressive\ncommunity In the county. In\nthe olden times the deer, bear,\nlk, cougar and bob cats roamed\nat large and drank from the pure\nsparkling waters of a thousand\n\' springs. Mrs. McWillis, stand-\n, lng In her door, could see the elk\nand deer sporting over the hills\nand the black bear feeding on\nwild berries and skunk cabbage.\nThe bay, too, was full of trout\nand Balmon. It was no trouble\nthen to get all the meat and fish\nyou wanted and game was not\ndestroyed then as it has been\nsince. Mrs. McWIUis said all\ntheir supplies of flour, sugar,\ncoffee, bacon and beans were\nbrought from the upper Alsea\nin flat boats down the river and\nthe mall came from Newport.\nOften theywould have to wait\nweeks before they got any mail\nat all. Mrs. McWillis says she\n; want to spend her last days at\nthe old home and when life\'s fllt-\nful dream is passed she wants to\n; rest with her departed friends\n, man the green hills overlooking\nthe beautiful Alsea bay.\nThe coast and geodetic survey\nhave just established an agency\nwith W. B. Hartley, Front street,\nfor the sale of coast and geodetic\nsurvey charts, coast pilots\' and\nUdetables, and for free distribu\ntion of chart catalogues and no\n, tlce to mariners. This agency\nwill make it handy for-the local\nmariners to obtain charts and\ntldetables where heretofore they\nhad to send to Portland or Mars\nfield for the same. "The local\n. agency has Information that the\n: new chart of Yaqulna bay, which\nwas prepared by Captain John\nW. Maupln and crew last Sum\nmer, will soon be Issued and a\nsupply furnished the agency\nhere. . Mr. Hartley has gone to\nconsiderable trouble to get this\nInformation for the accommoda\ntion of the people on the bay.\nA number of the people of\nNewport are going to attend the\nFourth of July celebration at\nCOUNTY\nWaldport next Saturday.\nlal ratea will be made by the auto\nmen for conveying people back\nann fn4n ,rivm that.

Edw. J. Clark,\nAttorney for riaintiff.\nSOME EARLY YAQUINA\nv, ; BAY HISTORY\nIn the "Early Days" column\nof the, Portland Journal, Fred\nLockey, the special staff writer\nof that paper, has the following\nto Bay of one of our pioneer, cit\nizens, Dr. F. M. Carter: -. \'\n"In 1865 when I was 19 years\nold I enlisted In Captain W.: V;\nRlnehart\'s company," said Dr.\nFranklin M. Carter of Newport.\n"Henry Mulkey had come to Eu\nerene from his farm and rode\nthrough the streets shouting for\nJefferson Davis and Booth and\nsaying Lincoln got what was\ncoming to him when he was as\nsassinated. \' We arrested him at\nLong Tom and while I wasi act\ning as orderly sergeant with the\nsoldiers taking Mulkey to Fort\nVancouver for a military trial I\nwas thrown from my horse at\nLancaster near the present town\nof Junction City and injured.\nFeeling was very Btrong 50 years\nago. Joaquin Miller\'s paper at\nEugene had been suppressed for\nsaying that the Fouth was right\nin aerenamg her soil from the\nnorthern invaders. After Lin\ncoln\'s assassination much bad\nfeeling was caused by Oregon\ncopperheads celebrating \' his\ndeath and toasting-his assassin.\nOne man was nearly killed for\nproposing this toast in a saloon,\n"Ilere\'B to the man who pulled\nthe trigger that killed the man\nthat freed the nigger.\n"After being discharged from\nthe army for injuries received in\nbeing thrown from my horse I\n.took up the study of medicine.\nI have been on the Silctz agency !\nor at Newport tor .tne past 40\nyears. This whole country has\nbeen held back by lack of trans\nportation. We have had a\ncheckered career along the line\nof railroad promotion. When\nDr. James R. Bayiey of Corvallis\nbuilt his house here at Newport\nat, an expense of $17,000 it was\nsaid that a railroad was to be\nbuilt from the entrance of Ya\nquina bay to Boise and that the\nwheat and wool of the inland\nempire and the timber of "the\nCascades would find a market\nthrough Yaquina bay, but the\ndream faded and Dr. Bayley lost\nhis beautiful home and the seven\nacres of land on which it is built\non a mortgage of $1200. Dr.\nBayley, though once wealthy,\ndied In poverty ami his body lies\nbeneath a simple stone in. the\ncemetery at Corvallis. The his\ntory of the building of the road\nis interesting from the time thej\nnrst ue was law to tne day the\nwhole property was sold to Ham\nmond for $100,000. The South\nern Pacific, which now owns it,\nis making extensive repairs on\nthe system.\nj "In 1863 Dr. J. R. Bayley, R. R.\nDiddle and T B Odeneal incor\nporated a toll road company\nwhich widened the Indian trail\nleading from Kings Valey to the\nhead of navigation on the Ya\nquina river to a wagon trail. In\n1865 they assumed additional\npowers and In 1871 their attor\nney filed supplemental articles to\npermit them to secure a . land\ngrant. Congress knew nothing\nabout Oregon and it didn\'t cost\nthe individual congressman any\nthing, so they handed over to\nthem without a murmur every\nother section for six. miles on\neach side of their wagon road.\nIn 1872 the toll road company\ntook In Colonel T. Egerton Hogg\nas a partner in their enterprise.\nHe brought no money\' to the\ncompany, but lots of optimism\nand enthusiasm.\n"Prior to this there had been\nvarious efforts to get a railroad\nto the coast On August 15,\n1867, articles- of incorporation\nwere filed of the Willamette Val\nley & Coast Railroad company\nby R. Irvine, T. B. Odeneal, John\nKelsay and 11 other residents of\nBenton county. The road never\ngot beyond the blue print stage.\n"In October,- 1871, a second\ncompany was formed, the incor\nporators being Dr. J. R. Bayley,\nBen Simpson and A. B. Mea\ncham. .This also died a-born-ing.\n. \'\n"On October 14, 1872, still an\nother railroad company- was\nformed, the incorporators being\nBen Simpson, Dr. J. R. Bayley.\nand Colonel T. Egerton flogg.\nThis al&o languished ond died.\n"In .July, 1874, O. W. Houck,\nR. S. Strahan, Sol King, B.
