NO 41\nWILSON\'S WORDS\nCLEAR UP DOUBT\nCALIFORNIA THROWS OVER ITS\nLEADER, JOHN80N, AND\nRALLIE8 TO LEAGUE.\nWEST GIVES IISM OYATIfKI\nAll Doubtful Features of Pact Are\nExplained Away By President, and\nFormer Doubters Hasten to Give\nHim Their Support\n(I tjr Independent News Bureau, form\nerly lit. Clemens News Bureau.)\nAboard President Wilson\'s Special\nTrain A continuous ovation along the\nPacific coast and then on his eastward\nway back toward the capital wa3 given\nto President Wilson as he came\ntoward the end of his month daylopg\nBpeaking tour in behalf of the League\nof Nations. California, particularly\nthe delightful city of Los Angeles, went\nwild in its enthusiasm for him and his\nadvocacy of the League, and it was\nIn that state, perhaps, that he did. his\nmost successful missionary . work.\nHiram Johnson, California\'s former\ngovernor, now her United States sena\ntor, and considered by her as the most\nlikely Republican candidate for tha\npresidency in 1920, had before the ar\nrival of President Wilson, convinced\na great number of citizens that the\nLeague as at present formulated was\nnot a good thing. He had toid them\nthat the United States, because of it,\nwould be drawn into every petty\nEuropean quarrel; he argued that we\nwould lose our sovereignty by Joining\nwith the European nations. He had\nblamed the president for assenting to\nthe possession by Japan of the Penin\nsula of Shan Tung in China.\nBUREAU CHANGES NAME\nThe Mount . Clemens News\nBureau, which has been furnishing\nreports on President Wilson\'s tour\nin behalf of the League of Nations\nto 5,500 papers, has adopted a new\nname and will hereafter be known\nas Tho Independent News Bureau.\nBut Mr. Wilson, with clear logic and\nwith compelling eloquence, answered\nto the entire satisfaction of Califor\nnia\'s people every objection which\nSenator Johnson had made to the\nLeague. And thousands of the state\'s\ncitizens deserted the Johnson stand\nard immediately and rallied to the sup\nport of the president. More than that,\nthey came forward and said, "We\nwere against you, Mr. President, but\nyou have cleared everything up and\nnow we are with you heart and soul."\nEtill more than that, they let Senator\nJohnson know that they were no\nlonger with him and that they disap\nproved of the speaking tour which he\nhimself was making in opposition to\nthe League and so powerful was the\nTolume of public opinion which reach\ned him, that the senator almost im\nmediately abandoned his tour. Tha\nShan Tung question, because of the\nanti-Japanese leeling which undoubted\nly exists along the .Pacific coast was\nthe most serious wWchthe president\nhad to answer. He explained to the\npeople that he tad been powerless to\nprevent the rich iieniasula from being\ngiven to Japan. England and France,\nthrough a secret treaty, had promised\nit to Japan for entering the war ana\nremaining la It That treaty had to\nbe carried out. Anyway it was not\nChina that was losing Shan Tung, but\nGermany, which had seized the terri\ntory from China In 1898 and held it\naver since. Japan had promised, tha\npresident explained, to return Shan\nTung as soon as the peace treaty was\nratified and it was only through the\nratification of the treaty with the\nLeague .of Nations Inclusion, that\nChina could ever expect to get her\nformer property back. And she surely\nwould get It back, he declared, through\nthe ratification of the League., There\nfore, through the same instrumentality\n. no other nation could again prey upon\nthe "Great, patient, diligent, but help\nless kingdom." Aa to our being drawn\nInto any European conflict. The pres\nident pointed out that no direct action\nsuch as the sending of troops to any\npart oflhe world to maintain or re\nstore order could be taken by the\nCouncil of the League without a unani\nmous vote of the council members,\ntherefore our vote could . at once nega\ntive any such proposition as sending\nonr soldiers where we did not - v-ant\nthem sent Besides, Mr. Wilson argued,\n"If you have to quench a fire in Cali\nfornia you don\'t send for the fire de\npartment of Utah." But, he argued,\nthere probably never will be another\nwar, if the League is established, for\nthe members promise either to arbi\ntrate their difference and accept tha\ndecision of the arbitrator, lay the dlf\nfeiences for discussion and publica\ntion before the Council of the League\nfor a period of six months, and then,\nIf possible, accept the council\'s advice.\nThat falling, they agree to refrain from\nwar for a further period of three\nmonths and nine months of "cooling\noff," the president contended, would\nprevent any armed conflict. These clear\nexplanations satisfied every reasonable\nhearer and destroyed the "Bugaboos"\nwhich Senator Johnson and others had\nraised against the League. Through\nrugged Nevada into Utah, the land of\nMormons, the president swept to find\n.hat those line people were heartily\n7lth him for the League And a per\nanency of peace.\nBOOT!
