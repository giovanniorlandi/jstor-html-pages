It\nhad been generally concluded that\nthere would be no No-license meeting\nat the Majestic, but the conclusion\nwas wrong.

It means the end of tae\nsaloon.\nTae No-I.icense people know the\n;csidence of every voter in Roswcll,\nand they know exactly who are voters\nand who are not voters. TUey pro\npone o use thi knowledge at the\npoll a. Men who are not voters will\nland in the penitentiary should they\nattempt to evade the laws by voting.\n1 And there w ill be something doing for\nthe men behind taese illegal would-be\nvoters. Just chalk that down.\nWilliams Jennings Bryan made\nspeech In Chattanooga, Tonn.. a aaort\ntime ago, before leaving for his South\nAmerica trip. There he flatly came\nout at-ainst the saloon. He stated iu\nhis address that he had been silent on\nthis subject for fifteen years, against\ntae wishes of his father, but that he\ncould be silent no longer. The evils\nof the open saloon had become so\nnotorious that he could not consent\nto remain silent on thorn. He advised\nthat the saloon be abolished, and war\nnod his hearers against the insidious\ninfluence of the saloon In the Demo\ncratic party. As a Democrat he ad\nvised that the party be saved by kill\ning the saloon Influence. Roswell\nDemocrats are following out his ad\nvice and will kill the saloon and the\nsaloon influence.\nIt Is possible that the liuqor people\nv.-ill attempt to trade votes to pull\nthrough their candidate for mayor.\nThey must know tney are doomed all\nalong the line, but it is probable they\nwill make a desperate effort to save\nthe mayor. There is reason In this\nfrom the saloon point of view. The\nmayor fcas the veto power in the city\ncouncil, and they will rely on \'aim to\nveto any move to refuse license to the\nsaloons. This means that No-LJcense\nvoters must vote a straight ticket.\nDon\'t allow feelings of friendship to\npersuade you to vote for a single man\non the saloon ticket. By so doing you\npause great damage to the No-LJcense\ncampaign and might even defeat its\nnjain object, the closing of the sa\nloons. We must and will elect the\nentire ticket, from top to bottom.\nOne of the methods commonly em\nployed to help out a lost cause In a\npolitical campaign Is to wait until tae\nlast moment and then spring some\nkind of a slander, oft or a plain lie.\nIt is depended upon to influence the\nvoters ard is held back until it Is too\nlite to effectually answer It. Cam\npaign arguments that are good In\nthemselves are not thus held back;\nthey are used right through tae fight.\nAnd aM this means that it caa be\nernrmonly accepted that when an ar\ncptment or a report stated as a fact\nis sprung upon the public at the last\nmoment, it is done because it is net\na fact, that there Is no trufa In it,\nand berause it could be easily refuted\nIt is held back until the last moment.\nThe Record does not know If such\na move Is contemplated by the liquor\npeople hi this campaign, but we do\ndesire to warn the people that any\nstory sprung at the last moment can\nbe set down as a lie, pure and simple\nand one that could be disproved\nshould tlxe be allowed.

I also believe\nthat the further development of di\nversified farming, including the rais\ning of livestock, and the constant vi\nilanc" of the farmer to insure tne\ngreatest yields rather, parhaps, than\nthe greatest acreage, will make tho\nr.eceFsities of life cheaper by lessen\ning the cost of production. The\nwholesale prices of choice beef, pork\nsnd mutton are fclg\'ner than normal\npaused by the high price of livestock\nrn th hoof, which is sympathetic\nwith and governed a good deaj by\nthe higii prices of grain and hay\nthroughout the United States. This\n-anae iu prices goes in periods, often\n?-w frr a few years, then high for a\nfw yews, and, no doubt, wiU be low-\nt again, all due to natural condi\nIons. Tiie wholesale price of the\ncommon and ordinary cuts of beef Is\nnot especially nigher than In other\n\'-ears. So far as I know, producers\nhave all participated to the fullest ex\ntent in the -wholesale prices realized\non all edi\'de products. The prices cf\nmeats are no higher In proportion\nthan th prices of com, wheat, oats,\nbutter, eggs and poultry. I believe\nhowever, there is a general extra va-crarK-e\non tne part of the American\npeople in purchasing their supplies,\nwhica can be modified by a closer\ninspection of the commodities pur\nchased n ho ild always be considered.\nPhe proper preparation and cooking\nof the cheaper cuts (or 74 per cent of\nthe beef) is being given considerable\nattention by domestic science authori\nties, with a view to increasing the\nuse of the cheaper cots, which ere\nJtst as nutritious a the rib and loin\nouts, thereby effecting a saving in the\ncost o llvir.g.
