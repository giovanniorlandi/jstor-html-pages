The ancient Silk Road played a crucial role in cultural\nexchange and commercial trade between western and\neastern Eurasia during the historical period. However, the exchanges\nwere interrupted in the early 16th century CE, during\nthe Ming dynasty. Various causes for the decline of the ancient\nSilk Road have been suggested. Unlike social factors,\nnatural factors have not been adequately addressed. In this\nstudy, we use evidence from a sedimentary site (Xishawo,\nXSW) in Dunhuang oasis, together with analysis of historical\narchives, to demonstrate the occurrence of extreme\ndroughts and desertification events in the Dunhuang area post\n∼ 1450 CE, which persisted at least for decades. The desertification\nmay be closely associated with the accessibility of\nthe ancient Silk Road in the area, which was responsible for a\nsteep fall in the volume of trade, as well as political chaos and\nmass migrations. Therefore, besides socio-economic factors,\nclimate change may have played an important role in trade\nexchange between the Ming government and the West and\nmay have even influenced the rise and decline of the ancient\nSilk Road.\n1 Introduction\nThe ancient Silk Road was the most important link between\nnations in Eurasia from the 2nd century BCE to the 16th century\nCE, and thus it indirectly shaped the politics, cultures\nand economies of populations across the Eurasian continent.\nThe route not only linked commercial trade between the East\nand West, but it also facilitated the spread of religion, technology\nand even diseases such as the plague (Jones et al.,\n2011; Chen et al., 2015; Schmid et al., 2015; Frankopan,\n2015; An et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2018; Hao et al., 2020;\nAfzaal, 2020). The Chinese section of the ancient Silk Road\npasses through one of the driest regions on Earth, and the logistical\noperation of the road depended directly on the oases\nthat developed along the foot of the high mountain ranges\n(the Qilian, Kunlun and Tianshan), mainly as a result of precipitation\nsupplied as streamflow from the highlands. Cities\nand towns emerged and developed in association with oases,\nsuch as Jiayuguan, Dunhuang, Hami and Ruoqiang, which\nfunctioned as logistical stations for trade between East and\nWest along the ancient Silk Road. The Jiayuguan Pass was\nat the western end of the Great Wall during the Ming dynasty.\nLocated at the narrowest point of the Hexi Corridor,\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n', '1396 G. Dong et al.: Climate-driven desertification and its implications for the ancient Silk Road trade\nthe Jiayuguan Pass was also a critical location on the primary\nrouteway between the western Gobi Desert and the domains\nof the Ming dynasty. Dunhuang commandery was 300 km\nfrom the Jiayuguan Pass and was the traffic hub which constituted\nthe historic junction of several routes along the ancient\nSilk Road in Central Asia (Huang and Wu, 2008). It passed\nto the control of the central government in 1372 CE, during\nthe early Ming dynasty. As a routeway, the ancient Silk Road\nreached a peak in the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), but its importance\ndeclined substantially in the 16th century CE with\nthe closure of the Jiayuguan Pass by the central government\nin China and the abandonment of Dunhuang city during the\nMing dynasty (1368–1644 CE). This event was an important\nmarker in terms of the severance of cultural exchange and\ntrade between East and West and the decline of the ancient\nSilk Road as an historically important routeway.\nSocioeconomic-related hypotheses have been proposed to\nexplain the decline of the ancient Silk Road during the later\nMing Dynasty. For example, frequent wars in the Dunhuang\narea have been suggested (Chen, 2011; Li and Zheng, 2013).\nIn order to consolidate the frontier territory, from the early\nMing dynasty onwards, the Ming governor successively established\nseven garrisons in the Jiayuguan–Dunhuang area\nand transferred the leadership to Mongolia, which governed\nthe seven garrisons (Chen, 2000). During the middle and\nlate Ming dynasty, national power declined due to political\ncorruption and financial stresses, but the bordering nations\nsuch as Oirat and Turpan continued to expand (Zhang, 1974).\nAgri-nomadic wars (conflict between agriculturalists and nomads),\nconflict between the seven garrisons and invasions by\nnomadic tribes in the Hexi Corridor were frequent. The border\npolicy of the administration weakened and there was a\ngradual isolation of the governance, especially after “the Tumubao\nCampaign” in ∼ 1450 CE, which is widely regarded\nas a turning point in the trajectory of the Ming government\nfrom prosperity to decline (Research Institute of History and\nLanguage of the Central Academy of Taiwan, 1962; Zhang,\n1974), and as a consequence the seven-garrisons region, including\nDunhuang city, was abandoned. The re-opening of\nthe Maritime Silk Road in the southern part of Ming territory\nwas suggested to be another cause of the interruption\nof the ancient Silk Road on land (Xie et al., 2007; Qian and\nJin, 2010; Zhai, 2017). Additionally, in terms of the international\ngeopolitical situation, after capturing Constantino-\nple in 1453 CE, the Ottoman Empire continued to expand\nacross the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, with\nits power and influence reaching a peak in the 16th century.\nA large and powerful state such as the Ottoman Empire may\nhave blocked trade between Europeans and the Chinese Ming\ngovernment along the ancient Silk Road (Faroqhi et al., 1994;\nBeckwith, 2009; Liu, 2014).\nOn the other hand, a pollen record from the sediments\nof Lake Tian’e in the Qilian Mountains reveals the occurrence\nof a distinctly drier climate during 1350–1600 CE, and\ntherefore an environmental-related hypothesis has also been\nsuggested for the timing of the decline of the ancient Silk\nRoad (Zhang et al., 2018). Previous high-resolution tree ring\nrecords from the Qilian Mountains revealed the occurrence\nof drought in the Hexi Corridor during 1450–1550 CE (Gou\net al., 2015a, b; Yang et al., 2014), corresponding to the onset\nof a cold climate during the Little Ice Age (LIA) during CE\n1450–1850 (Mann et al., 2009). However, these tree ring and\nlake sediment records are from the eastern part of the Hexi\nCorridor, and there are no reliable paleoclimatic records from\nthe Dunhuang area in the western part. Throughout human\nhistory, climate change has been regarded as an important\nand sometimes critical factor for the rise and fall of ancient\ncivilizations (Wang et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2021), such as in\nthe cases of Mesopotamia (Weiss, 1993), the Maya (Kennett\net al., 2012; Medina-Elizalde and Rohling, 2012; Nooren et\nal., 2018), Angkor (Buckley et al., 2010), and the decline of\nthe Loulan Kingdom on the ancient Silk Road (Fontana et\nal., 2019; Fig. 1).\nIn the present study, we focus on the role that paleoenvironmental\nvariations may have played on the ancient Silk\nRoad in the Duanhuang–Jiayuguan area, which in terms of\nthe physical environment is the most inhospitable section of\nthe ancient Silk Road, being dominated by the Gobi Desert.\nFirst, the results of a detailed sedimentary investigation of the\nXishawo site (near Dunhuang city) are presented and the paleoenvironmental\nchange are evaluated. Second, the relevant\navailable literature is reviewed and a sociopolitical analysis\nof the historical archives in Dunhuang and the surrounding\nareas in Ming China are used to determine environmental and\nsociopolitical changes in the area during the study period. Finally,\nthe influence of the natural environment on the trade\nexchange between the Ming dynasty and Western countries\non the abandonment of the Dunhuang area and on the official\nclosure of the ancient Silk Road in the early 16th century CE\nare reviewed.\n2 Study area\nThe Hexi Corridor (37◦15′ to 41◦30′ N, 92◦21′ to 104◦45′ E)\nis located to the north of the Qilian Mountains and south of\nBeishan Mountain. It is long and narrow and stretches for\nover 1000 km from Wushaoling Mountain in the east to the\nboundary of Gansu and Xinjiang provinces in the west, but it\nextends for only tens to some hundreds of kilometers in the\nnorth–south direction (Fig. 1). The area corresponds to the\nzone of climatic interaction between arid Central Asia and\nmonsoonal Asia and is climatically characterized by a continental\nmonsoon climate influenced by both the westerlies\nand the monsoon. The annual precipitation is no more than\n∼ 200 mm, but the evaporation ranges from 1500 to 3000 mm\n(Huang et al., 2017). The annual temperature is ∼ 0–10 ◦C.\nThe Hexi Corridor consists of three independent landlocked\nriver systems: the Shule River basin, the Heihe River basin\nand the Shiyang River basin, from west to east.

Location of the study area and cities along the ancient Silk Road (dotted circles are oasis cities that were already abandoned\nbefore the Ming dynasty, solid circles are oasis cities that still existed during the Ming dynasty, the cities in parentheses were under Ming\ngovernorship, and the dotted area is the Gobi Desert near Dunhuang and Guazhou). The base map comes from © Google Maps.\nof the three rivers is generated by the glaciers of the Qilian\nMountains and is consumed in the middle and lower reaches\nof Owase Lake or in the deserts within the basin. Diverse\nlandscapes of mountains, oases, deserts and Gobi are alternately\ndistributed in the area. The unique topography and lo-\ncation of the Hexi Corridor were largely responsible for its\ngreat strategic and military importance to historical dynasties\nover the past 2000 years. It was also known as the key\nrouteway (the ancient Silk Road) for cultural and commercial\nexchanges between Chinese and western countries for\nthousands of years.\nThe oasis ecological system in arid areas is fragile because\nof the closed environment, sparse vegetation and wa-\nter scarcity. However, the bead-like distribution of oases\nplayed a crucial role in the exchange of merchandise in\nEurasia. Jiayuguan city was the northwestern gateway of the\nMing domain and a key fortress along the routeway of EastWest\neconomic exchange. Dunhuang city and Guazhou city\n(∼ 120 km northeast of Dunhuang) are located in the eastern\nGobi Desert to the west of the Jiayuguan pass (Fig. 1).\nThe ancient Silk Road split into three branches in a westerly\ndirection from the region. The northern branch led to\nthe northwest of Hami oasis and the oasis cities of Turfan,\nYanqi, Qiuci, and Gumo and then to Central Asia. The central\nbranch passed through Loulan city (300 km west of Dun-\nhuang), which was abandoned in∼ 330 CE because of eolian\nactivity (Yuan and Zhao, 1999; James, 2007; Fontana et al.,\n2019). The southern branch connected many cities along the\nsouthern edge of the Taklimakan Desert, such as Ruoqiang,\nQiemo and Yutian, on the northern piedmont of the AltynTagh\nand the Kunlun Mountains (Fig. 1). As can be seen in\nFig. 1, the location of Dunhuang oasis led to its importance as\nthe only logistical station between Hami oasis and Ruoqiang\noasis and the Jiayuguan oasis during the Ming dynasty.\nThe Xishawo (XSW) section in this study is located near\nthe ancient city of Xishawo in the modern Gobi Desert area\nof the Shule River basin. The site is in the middle of the Dunhuang\nand Guazhou oases, ∼ 50 km northeast of Dunhuang\ncity (Fig. 1). The Xishawo site was previously an ancient oasis\nwith cultural sites, ancient cities and beacon towers. Relict\nriver channels are present at several locations, although most\nof them are buried by sand dunes (Li, 1990; Cheng, 2007).\nThe modern annual mean precipitation and annual mean temperature\nof the area are 45.3 mm and 8.8 ◦C, respectively.\nPrevious research has revealed that the Xishawo site was\noccupied during ∼ 900–1400 CE, and the inhabitants cultivated\nbarley, broomcorn and foxtail millet during this pe-\nriod (Li et al., 2017). Wind-eroded landforms are common\nin the region as a consequence of the arid climate, sparse\nvegetation cover and frequent sandstorms. The exposed part\nof the XSW section is ∼ 3 m thick and consists mainly of\na sand dune, which is fixed by the dead roots of Salix and\ntherefore preserved. The surface of the profile was cleaned\nto remove contamination by modern sediments and plant\nroots. The stratigraphic description of XSW section from the\ntop to 270 cm depth is as follows: (1) 0–10 cm, fine sand;\n(2) 10–46 cm, dark-gray paleosol, with a 4 cm thick black\ncultural layer at 30–34 cm; (3) 46–100 cm, light-yellowish\nloess; (4) 100–125 cm, loess-like paleosol; (5) 125–185 cm,\ndark gray clay with Fe–Mn nodules; (6) 185–250 cm, yelhttps://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1395-2021\nClim.

A total\nof 135 samples were collected at a 2 cm interval for measurements\nof weight loss-on-ignition (LOI), grain size, and\nelement contents. One wood sample (at the depth of 10 cm,\nlabeled XSW-10) and one charcoal sample (from the cultural\nlayer at 32 cm, labeled XSW-32) were collected for accelerator\nmass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS 14C) dating. Two\neolian samples for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)\ndating from the fine yellow sand layer (188 and 248 cm, labeled\nXSW-188, XSW-248, respectively) were collected by\nhammering stainless-steel cylinders into the section vertically,\nwhich were immediately sealed with opaque tape after\nremoval.\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Laboratory analyses\n3.1.1 Chronology\nAMS 14C and OSL dating were used to establish a chronological\nframework for the XSW section. The charcoal and\nwood samples for AMS 14C dating were prepared by the\nacid–base–acid procedure at the MOE Key Laboratory in\nLanzhou University and measured at the AMS 14C dating\nlaboratory of Peking University. The IntCal13 curve, Libby\nhalf-life of 5568 years and OxCal 4.2 were used to calibrate\nall of the dates (Reimer et al., 2013). All ages reported are\nrelative to 1950 CE (referred to as “cal BCE” and “cal CE”).\nOSL dating was conducted at the OSL Laboratory at the\nMOE Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental\nSystem, Lanzhou University. Two OSL dating samples were\ncollected from the XSW section. The pretreatment procedure\nfollowed that described in Aitken (1998). OSL measurement\nof coarse-grained (90–125 µm) quartz were performed using\nan automated Risø TL/OSL DA-20 reader. Laboratory irradiation\nwas carried out using 90Sr / 90Y sources. The quartz\nOSL signal was detected by a photomultiplier tube through\ntwo 3 mm thick Hoya U-340 filters and the K-feldspar IRSL\nsignal was detected using a package of Corning7-59 and BG39\nfilters. The purity of the quartz extracts was checked using\nthe IR depletion ratio test (Duller, 2003). A single aliquot regenerative\nprotocol (Murray and Wintle, 2003) was applied\nto quartz samples to obtain the equivalent dose (De). The\nconcentrations of the radioactive elements uranium (238U),\nthorium (232Th) and potassium (40K) were measured by neutron\nactivation analysis (NAA) to calculate the dose rate.\nThe cosmic ray contribution was calculated according to the\nburial depth and altitude of the samples (Prescott and Hutton,\n1994). A water content of 10± 5 % was used to the calculate\nages of sand–loess sediments.\n3.1.2 Analysis of climatic proxies\nMeasurements of LOI, grain size and element contents were\nmade at the MOE Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental\nSystem Lanzhou University. LOI measurements\nwere used to determine the organic matter content of the\nsediments. The measurements were made at a 2 cm interval\nand calculated as LOI550(%)= (m105−m550)/m105×100%,\nwherem105 is the sample weight after oven-drying at 105 ◦C,\nand m550 is the sample weight after combustion at 550◦ for\n4 h in a muffle furnace.\nSamples for grain-size analysis were pre-treated with 10 %\nH2O2 and 10 % HCL to remove organic matter and carbonates,\nrespectively. The samples were then dispersed by\nultrasonication with the addition of 10 % sodium hexametaphosphate.\nGrain-size distributions were measured with a\nMalvern MS 2000 laser grain-size analyzer.\nSamples for the analysis of element contents were pretreated\nas follows. All samples were oven-dried for 24 h and\nthen pulverized into a powder. About 4 g of powder was then\npressed into a 4–6 mm thick and 30 mm in diameter pellet under\n30 t m−2 of pressure. The major, minor and trace element\ncontents were measured with a Magix PW2403 wavelengthdispersive\nXRF spectrometer. Elemental concentrations of\n0.1 ppm to 100 % could be analyzed. Rb /Sr ratios were calculated\nfor paleoenvironmental reconstruction.\n3.2 Analysis of published paleoenvironmental records\nand documentary evidence for the region\n3.2.1 Previous paleoclimatic records from the region\nAll available high-resolution paleoclimatic records for the\nstudy area and the adjacent region were reviewed and compared.\nThey include records of regional temperature, precip-\nitation and river flow. In addition, documentary evidence of\nclimate change in the region during the Ming dynasty was\ninvestigated.\n3.2.2 Sociohistorical archives\nSociohistorical records, such as records of the political,\neconomic and military activity of the Ming dynasty, were\nanalyzed (Zhang, 1974; Chinese Military History Writing\nGroup, 2003; Yu, 2003), together with sociohistorical\nrecords of the Jiayuguan–Dunhuang area.\n4 Results and discussion\n4.1 Effects of warfare on the ancient Silk Road\nThe Jiayuguan–Dunhuang area experienced frequent political\nturmoil and conflicts during the Ming dynasty (Zhang,\n1974). Warfare in the northwestern part of the Ming domain\nwas suggested to be the main cause for the repeated (twice)\nclosure of the Jiayuguan Pass and the severance of the ancient\nSilk Road (Gao and Zhang, 1989; Chen, 2011). The\nJiayuguan Pass was established in 1372 CE during the early\nMing dynasty to resist the remaining elements of the Yuan\ndynasty (1271–1368 CE), and the Hexi Corridor was under\nClim. Past, 17, 1395–1407, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1395-2021\n', 'G. Dong et al.: Climate-driven desertification and its implications for the ancient Silk Road trade 1399\nthe total control of the Ming government during the Ming dynasty.\nIn addition, the Ming dynasty government established\nseven garrisons to the west of Jiayuguan Pass to reduce pressure\non the border (Zhang, 1974). The Jiayuguan Pass was\nnot only a military stronghold but also the primary pass on\nthe ancient Silk road to the West.\nIn order to investigate the relationship between conflict\nand the closure of the Jiayuguan Pass, the frequency of\nagri-nomadic conflict in the Dunhuang area was estimated\nbased on historical archives (Chinese Military History Writing\nGroup, 2003; Yu, 2003). The incidence of agri-nomadic\nconflicts in the Hexi Corridor was also summarized for comparison\n(Fig. 2a). The classification of agri-nomadic conflict\nwas adopted because it directly reflects the conflict between\nthe central government and nomadic peoples. The frequency\nof tribute trade and the number of tribute states in the Western\nRegions are illustrated in Fig. 2b and c (Chinese Mil-\nitary History Writing Group, 2003; Yu, 2003). All of the\ndata were grouped into 5-year intervals. It is evident that\nconflicts between agriculturalists and nomads occurred constantly\nfrom 1368 CE, during the early Ming dynasty, until\n1520 CE. However, conflicts ceased in the Dunhuang area\nafter 1520 CE, which shows that the final closure of the Jiayuguan\nPass in 1539 CE substantially reduced the frequency\nof nomad incursions in the Dunhuang area. However, evidence\nis still needed to confirm that agri-nomadic conflicts\nwere responsible for the closures of the Jiayuguan Pass in\n1524 CE and 1539 CE, and for the decline of the ancient Silk\nRoad. For example, it is unclear why – if agri-nomadic conflicts\nno longer occurred after 1520 CE – the Jiayuguan Pass\nwas closed decades later in 1539 CE. It is also unclear why\nthere was a lull in political unrest and violence in the Dunhuang\narea from 1450 CE.\nFigure 2b and c show that tribute exchange between the\nMing government and the western regions has no obvious\nrelationship with the frequency of conflicts. The tribute trade\nfrequency and the number of tribute states both reached a\npeak during 1400–1450 CE but then decreased sharply after\n1450 CE and subsequently remained at a low level. As\nFig. 2a demonstrates, there were frequent agri-nomadic conflicts\nduring 1400–1450 CE, followed by a truce that lasted\nfor about 20 years. However, the tribute trade declined substantially\nduring the truce (1450–1470 CE) and there was\nno obvious revival until the collapse of the Ming dynasty\n(Fig. 2b and c).\nIt has been determined that the Jiayuguan Pass–Dunhuang\ncity route was the crucial routeway connecting the western\nregions to the core territory of the Ming dynasty (Zhang,\n1974). The absence of a relationship between the frequency\nof wars in the Dunhuang area and variations in the amount of\ntribute trade demonstrates that an increase in the frequency\nof warfare was probably not the primary or single cause of\nthe collapse of trade along the ancient Silk Road.\nMoreover, war was not solely responsible for the closure\nof the Jiayuguan Pass. The first closure of the Jiayuguan Pass\nin 1524 CE may have been a consequence of wars in the\nDunhuang area, although wars also occurred frequently during\nperiods when trade flourished (1400–1450 CE) (Fig. 2a).\nHowever, subsequently there was a continuous state of peace\nin the Dunhuang area that lasted for decades, and the city was\nonly abandoned by the final closure of the Jiayuguan Pass in\n1539 CE. Therefore, we conclude that an increase in the frequency\nof warfare is not a tenable explanation for the decline\nof the ancient Silk Road.\n4.2 Influence of climate change on the ancient Silk\nRoad\n4.2.1 Paleoclimatic record of the XSW section\nThe paleoclimatic record of the XSW section in the\nDunhuang area was used to assess the possible role\nof climate change in the decline of the ancient Silk\nRoad. The results of the analysis of various climatically\nsensitive parameters, together with the 14C and\nOSL chronology, are illustrated in Table 1 and Fig. 3.\nThe 14C dates for the fine sand layer (XSW-10) and\nthe cultural layer (XSW-32) are 499± 10 cal yr BP (1440–\n1460 cal CE) and 701± 27 cal yr BP (1224–1278 cal CE), respectively.\nThe two OSL samples from the sand layer\nare dated to 2.6± 0.2 ka (800± 300 BCE) and 2.8± 0.2 ka\n(600± 200 BCE) (Table 2). Profiles of grain size, LOI and\nRb /Sr ratio are shown in Fig. 3a, b, c and d, respectively.\nThe increase in median grain size and of the > 63 µm fraction\nindicate an arid environment and intense wind activity in\nthe Dunhuang area during 800–600 BCE and at ∼ 1450 CE.\nThe LOI record reflects variation in organic matter content,\nand the Rb /Sr ratio of eolian sediments is positively correlated\nwith weathering intensity. The Rb /Sr ratio of the\ntwo sand layers is very low (Fig. 3), and therefore the effects\nof weathering are minor (Gallet et al., 1996; Chen\net al., 1999), suggesting that precipitation in the Dunhuang\narea was low during ∼ 800–600 BCE and after ∼ 1450 CE.\nA comparison of the LOI and Rb /Sr profiles indicates that\nduring 800–600 BCE and after∼ 1450 CE the organic matter\ncontent of the section was low and chemical weathering was\nweak. These results suggest the occurrence of overall arid\nconditions, frequent dust storms and associated desertification\nevents during 800–600 BCE, i.e., the Spring and Autumn\nperiod (771–476 BCE) of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, and after\n∼ 1450 CE (the Ming dynasty). These conditions would\nhave been very unfavorable for human habitation of the area.\nThe two desertification events recorded in the XSW section\nwere not solely local events. A cold and dry climate at\nthese times is also evident in paleoclimatic records from the\nnearby Qilian Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau. A tree ring\nrecord from the Qilian Mountains suggests that precipitation\nwas low during 900–550 BCE (Yang et al., 2014). A pollen\nrecord from Juyanze lake indicates the low representation of\ntree pollen at the same time (Herzschuh et al., 2004). The\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1395-2021 Clim.

The timing of the second desertification\nevent in the Dunhuang area, in ∼ 1450 CE, coincides well\nwith changes in a tree ring record from mountains in the\nwestern Hexi Corridor, which suggests an interval of persistent\nlow precipitation during 1430–1540 CE (Fig. 2f, Gou et\nal., 2015a). An interval of reduced precipitation during this\ntime is also widely recorded in other high-resolution tree\nring records from the northern Tibetan Plateau (Gou et al.,\n2015b; Yang et al., 2014), and in the laminated sediments\nof Sugan lake in the western Qaidam Basin (Qiang et al.,\n2005). A decrease in global temperature at ∼ 1450 CE has\nalso been widely detected in high-resolution paleoclimatic\nrecords from various locations (Thompson et al., 1997; Wilson\net al., 2016; Lecavalier et al., 2017) and is also recorded\nin historical documentary records from China (Ge et al.,\n2003). This evidence indicates the occurrence of two desertification\nevents in the Dunhuang area and elsewhere, during\n∼ 800–600 BCE and after ∼ 1450 CE, that were related to\nregional-scale climatic and environmental deterioration.\nAs mentioned earlier, the oasis ecological system in arid\nregions is relatively fragile, with the major limiting factor\nbeing water availability (Qian and Jin, 2010). At the present\ntime, vegetation survival in the oasis of the Hexi Corridor\ndepends mainly on runoff from the Qilian Mountains,\nwhich is derived firstly from precipitation in the highlands\nand secondly from glacier meltwater (Liu et al., 2010; Yang\net al., 2011; Sakai et al., 2012). The prominent long interval\nof reduced precipitation and temperature in the Qil-\nian Mountains and in the Tibetan Plateau during ∼ 800–\n600 BCE and at ∼ 1450 CE caused a large decrease in runoff\nto the lowlands of the Hexi Corridor, which in turn caused\nvegetation degradation and the extension of the Gobi Desert.\nCompared to other oasis cities along the ancient Silk Road,\nwhich were much closer to the high mountain glaciers (above\n4500 m a.s.l., Fig. 1) that provided a constant supply of meltwater,\nDunhuang oasis was located much closer to the center\nClim.

The Hexi Corridor was extensively settled from\nthe Majiayao period (3300–2000 BCE) (Li, 2011), and foxtail\nmillet and broomcorn millet, which were domesticated\nin northern China, were cultivated in the region (Zhou et al.,\n2016; Dong et al., 2018). Innovations in agricultural technology\nfacilitated the rapid development of bronze cultures\nin the Hexi Corridor and the surrounding areas in the succeeding\nmillennium (Dong et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016).\nHowever, there is a gap in radiocarbon dates during ∼ 850–\n650 BCE in the western Hexi Corridor and eastern Xinjiang\n(Fig. A1), which suggests a hiatus in cultural evolution and\nexchange during this period. This hiatus corresponds well to\nthe desertification event in the Dunhuang area of the western\nHexi Corridor during∼ 800–600 BCE (Fig. 3). However,\neven though the climate fluctuated substantially in northwest\nChina during the Bronze Age, human settlement was\ncontinuous in the eastern Hexi Corridor at the same longitude\n(Fig. A1), which suggests that human occupation of the\nHexi Corridor was primarily determined by the environmental\nconditions.\nThe second desertification event occurred at ∼ 1450 CE\nand is recorded both in the sand layer of the XSW profile\nand in the historical and cultural literature. The drought in\nthe Dunhuang area at this time was described as follows:\n“The wind shakes the Tamarix in thousands of miles of uninhabited\nland” and “the moon shines on the quicksand on\neach departed day” (Huang and Wu, 2008). The ancestors\nof the Uyghur people, who originally settled in the Duanhuang\narea after the abandonment of Dunhuang, sang folk\nsongs about the human migrations through the Jiayuguan\nPass during the Ming dynasty (Chen, 2011). An epic of the\nmigration of the Uyghur history contains the following passage:\n“Violent winds swept livestock away, sand dunes sub-\nmerged tents and houses, rivers dried up, grassland was devastated”\n(Wang, 1992; Editorial Group of a Brief History of\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1395-2021 Clim. Past, 17, 1395–1407, 2021\n', '1402 G. Dong et al.: Climate-driven desertification and its implications for the ancient Silk Road trade\nthe Uyghur minority, 2008). From these descriptions it can\nbe deduced that the prolonged drought at ∼ 1450 CE may\nhave led to the disappearance of the oasis. The altered ecoenvironment\nwould have reduced the productivity of agricul-\nture and animal husbandry, which would have caused a local\nfood shortage. The deteriorated environment was very likely\nanother cause of mass migration in addition to warfare. The\nchanging geopolitical situation in the western Hexi Corridor\nand eastern Xinjiang was an important factor in the abandonment\nof the Dunhuang area by the Ming government, and\nthe extreme and the persistent drought event after∼ 1450 CE\nmay have intensified the social upheaval and chaos (Fig. 2d,\nblue triangles highlight mass migrations) that triggered this\nsignificant historical event. Notably, a significant relationship\nhas been observed between decreased precipitation, wars and\nthe abandonment of cultivated land in the region during the\nlast 2000 years (Li et al., 2019).\n4.2.3 Desertification events in the ancient Silk Road\narea\nVarious indicators of climatic variations, wars and the tribute\ntrade are plotted in Fig. 2 versus the chronological sequence\nof the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE). Under the premise that\nat ∼ 1450 CE the environment was characterized by a cold\nand dry climate with intense sandstorms (Fig. 2e), low precipitation\n(Fig. 2f) and decreased streamflow (Fig. 2g), there\nis a possibility that climate change played a role on the tribute\ntrade of the ancient Silk Road. There was an abrupt de-\ncrease in the frequency of tribute trade at ∼ 1450 CE but not\nduring the two closures of the Jiayuguan Pass in 1524 CE\nand 1539 CE (Fig. 2b and d). In addition, at this time there\nwas a lull in conflicts in the Dunhuang area (Fig. 2a). Therefore,\nit is proposed that environmental deterioration likely\ncontributed to the decline of the tribute trade and the cessation\nof hostilities. Climatic perturbations and environmental\ndegradation may not necessarily be a direct trigger of a societal\ncrisis, but they may instead result in institutional failure\ncaused by the lack of a centralized response to an environmental\ncrisis (Feng et al., 2019; White and Pei, 2020). So-\ncial disturbance associated with migrations and chaos in the\nMing dynasty was likely an indirect consequence of environmental\nchanges. For example, the consequences of a de-\nteriorating environment would include the shrinkage of the\nhabitat and agricultural land necessary for human survival,\nmultiple waves of human migrations into the eastern part of\nthe Hexi Corridor, and the shift of the frontier from Dunhuang\nto the Jiayuguan pass. Thus, the population decline in\nthe Dunhuang area during the early Ming Dynasty was most\nprobably a “domino effect” (Feng et al., 2019).\nThe influence of the desertification event in ∼ 1450 CE on\nthe streamflow of the Qilian Mountains gradually decreased\nafter the 1520s CE (Fig. 2f and g). However, the formation\nand evolution of an oasis is a long-term process (Stamp,\n1961; Zhang and Hu, 2002; Li et al., 2016), and the ecological\nresponse of an oasis to climatic drying would not to\nbe to disappear immediately (Fan, 1993). Moreover, it takes\nat least 15–20 years for the recovery of a degraded oasis following\ndestruction by ∼ 1–3 years of human activity (Zhang\nand Hu, 2002). Therefore, the regeneration of a degraded oasis\nwould take much longer than a change in the streamflow.\nOverall, we propose that the abrupt decrease in tribute exchange\nand prosperity, or even the decline of the ancient Silk\nRoad overall, may have been affected by the deterioration\nof the environment along the routeway in the Ming dynasty\n(Fig. 2b and c).\nWe now address the issue of how the desertification at\n∼ 1450 CE in the Dunhuang oasis and adjacent regions may\nhave affected the functioning of the ancient Silk Road. First,\ntrading in the arid environment of the ancient Silk Road led\nto the increase in the importance of oasis cities. Camel caravans\nneeded supplies of grain and water from an oasis as\nthey traversed the extensive desert along the road. The desertification\nevents recorded in the XSW section and in the\nadjacent regions indicate that Dunhuang oasis and Guazhou\noasis were not functioning at ∼ 1450 CE. This lengthened\nthe distance from the Jiayuguan oasis in the Hexi Corridor\nto the western oasis in Xinjiang (Fig. 1). According to several\nresearchers, camel caravans in desert areas were able\nto travel a maximum distance of ∼ 30 km d−1 (Shui, 1990;\nWang et al., 2000). In addition, the metabolism of a domesticated\ncamel will decrease within 20 d from the beginning of\nwater deprivation (Chen, 1982). Under working conditions,\ncamels can go for ∼ 10–15 d without water under a mean\nambient temperature of 35 ◦C (Kataria et al., 2001). A camel\ncaravan took 59 d to traverse the 1400 km of the Taklimakan\nDesert in 1993 CE under modern climatic conditions, which\nare much more favorable than in ∼ 1450 CE, and the maximum\ndistance was 24 km in 1 d (Blackmore, 2000). The max-\nimum distance for a caravan in the water-limited environment\non the Silk Road was 30 km d−1\n× 15 d= 450 km. The\ndistances of Hami, Ruojiang and Jiayuguan to Dunhuang, located\nin the Gobi Desert in an area without high mountains,\nare already close to or above this limit, which is barely sufficient\nfor camel travel (shown by the dots in Fig. 1, near\nthe Dunhuang and Shazhou oases). On the other hand, the\ndistances between the oases along the routes on the piedmonts\nof the high mountain ranges (Qilian, Kunlun and Tian-\nshan) are generally less than 200 km as the high mountain\nranges provide meltwater. After the desertification event, the\ndistances between Jiayuguan and Hami oases (the northern\nroute of the ancient Silk Road) and between Jiayuguan and\nRuoqiang oases (the southern route) increased to ∼ 600 and\n∼ 1000 km, respectively. This is close to the maximum distance\nthat a camel caravan can achieve (∼ 450 km) without\na water supply, and would have substantially increased the\ndifficulty of travel across the region and was likely to be the\nphysical cause of the decline of the ancient Silk road during\nthe periods of desertification.\nClim.

Dong et al.: Climate-driven desertification and its implications for the ancient Silk Road trade 1403\n5 Conclusion\nWe have systematically investigated a possible climatic cause\nof the interruption of the operation of the ancient Silk Road\nduring the Ming Dynasty. A compilation of the results of absolute\ndating and high-resolution paleoclimatic records from\nthe XSW site in the Dunhuang area and historical archives\nreveals that two desertification events occurred, at ∼ 800–\n600 BCE and ∼ 1450 CE. The later desertification event was\nconsistent with the immediate fall in tribute trade that occurred\nin ∼ 1450 CE, which indicates that environmental\ndeterioration may have disrupted the trading exchanges by\ndraining the oases in Dunhuang and Guazhou city, which\nwere strategic logistical stations in the vast Gobi Desert. This\nresulted in traveling distances between supply stations exceeding\nthe physical limit for camel caravans and an irre-\nversible decline in trade exchange. On the other hand, the\nincidence of agri-nomadic conflicts from historical archives\nsuggests that warfare alone is not the best explanation for the\nseverance of exchanges between Western countries and the\nMing government. Hence, we propose that climate change\nalso played a potentially important role in explaining the decline\nof the ancient Silk Road trade.\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1395-2021 Clim.
