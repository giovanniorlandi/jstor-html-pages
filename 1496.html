Onr dairies are located in seven northern states\nin the heart of our best dairying sections. They\nare stocked with Holstein cows.\nThe dairies are cleanly; the cows are inspected.\nThe purity of the milk is most carefully guarded.\nWherever you go, whatever you pay, you will\nnever taste milk that\'s better than Van Camp\'s.\nWater Taken Out\nTo bring this milk to you in an economical\nway we evaporate most of the water. Not by\nboiling not by scalding. We do it in a vacuum,\nin moderate heat at 125 degrees.\nThis is done close to each dairy, in a modern\nplant, under clean and aseptic conditions. Thus\ntwo-thirds of the water is taken out from the milk\nthat comes fresh from the cow.\nNothing is added whatever no sugar, no starch,\nno preservative. Nothing but water is taken out.\nThen the milk is put up in sealed cans, and then\npasteurized. \' When you put back the water, you\nhave the natural milk as it came from the cow,\n6ave for the sterilization\n8 Butter Fat\nThe milk as it comes to you is as thick as thick\ncream. It is 23 per cent solids 8 per cent batter\nfat. In coffee or on cereals it tastes like the rich\nest cream\nIn cooking it gives a rich flavor to milk dishes :\nthe flavor of whole, rich milk. You-don\'t get\nwhole milk from the milk wagon, because the\nmilk separates. There is always a dearth of\nbutter fat or solids. The milk which gets to your -cooking\nis rarely more than a half-milk\'\nYou\'ll be amazed at the flavor which Van -Camp\'s\ngives to milk dishes.. Yet it\'s nothing;\nbut rich, whole milk. - -\nUtterly Sterile\nVan Camp\'s Milk is free from germs absolute- -ly\nfree. Where there are millions of germs in .\neach drop of raw milk, there isn\'t one in a gallon\nof this. \' - (\nThink what that means no . chance of infec\ntion. All the dangers that lurk in raw milk are \'\navoided. A pasteurized milk the only sort safe\nto use.\nYou can buy, if you wish, a month\'s supply at\na time. It is like having a cow. in the pantry. \'\nrv\nThen you have milk or cream rich csd btd tzj\ntime you want it. Yoo have, all jooi vxztjmix\nnone left oyer, lor the opened can kera tin yea\nuse it up. -\nSaves Abcnl Kc!i\nWe save you the cost of the jpSLaaa\'s ds2j\ndelivery. VThat costs more than te cult.
