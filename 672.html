The\nidea is, us I understand it, that\nspecial invitations bo extended to\nthe officials of the I. (I. and the M.\n& O. railroads, who have been very\nliberal in their contributions to the\nroad now building, and that the\npeople of the other four beats, as\nwell as those of Beat I be invited to\nlake part in the occasion. In other\nwords, it is to be a general Oktib\nbeha County round-up of all who are\nenthusiastic or interested in good\nroads.\nNow, here is suggestion number\none:- Don’t call it a celebration of\nthe completion of the macadam\nroad and concrete walks to the\nCollege, but let it be to celebrate\nthe beginning of good road build\ning in Oktibbeha County. That nice\nlittle milo-and-a-half stretch of\nspeedway is all right, of course. I\ndon\'t propose to knock it, and no\nfair minded taxpayer of the county\nwill begrudge the help toward it\nvytod by the Supervisors. To hear\na few follows who will have to pay\nabout thirty cents on it talk, you\nwould think they had done it all.\nAnd some of the very same men\nwill gladly give ten times that much\ntowards a barbecue and forget what\nit cost them the next day. Human\nnature is sometimes like a knotty\nand cross-grained piece of wood\nwhen handled right and polished\nup, makes a prettier finish than\nthe smooth-grained piece.\nIho macadam road is all right.\nI mu glad it is to bo good and wido,\n<• if I meet two or throo of those\nt hoo Choo felloows when I am\ndriving out to tho College, Tube and\nKhody will have plenty of room to\nout a graceful figgor in when they\ndo the two-step around ’em. But sie\nhero, Mr. Kditor, jut (his in your\ncheroot and smoke it-- we also\nwant a nice little two or three mile\nstretch of first class antomomule\noad, just, for a starter. They’ve\nboon talking about how cheap and\ngood dragged roads are. Now let’s\nsee one “drug”. Or, at least show\nus one little stretch that’s ready for\nthe drag when tho rains\'come.\nAnother thing, if th) proposed\nbarbecue and celebration is to boa\nsuccess wouldn’t it boa good idea to\nkeep all politics out of it? Wo have\neach one got our preference among\nthe candidates and most of ns are\nPretty well “sot” in our ideas al\nready. But one thing is certain,\nregardless of who is elected Sena\ntor, or governor, or anything else,\nOktibbeha County must work out\nher own salvation on the road ques\ntion. And that is the most impor\ntaut question before us. We would\nhe glad to have Alexander, Percy,\n\' m daman and Brewer honor the\noccasion with their presence, but\nthey should be on a political vaca\ntion for the day. Capt. Merry of the\nI. t., Mr. Bussell and Mr. Bichards\nof the M. &0,, and good roads ex\nperts should be flie speakers, and\nevery speech should lie on tho sub\nject of good roads.\ni\' (inner 1). A. Saunders’ demon*\nstratum to the Railroard officials\nas to a mile- a- minute schedule\nover the macadam road would be\ninteresting. But don.t leave out the\nother automobile men. There must\nbe forty or more of them. Let’s\nhave them all in a grand dress pa\nrade and invite the Choo Choo men\nfrom West Point and Columbus to\ncome over and join in it.

For\ninstance, you might get him a pair\nof wings for his car and 1 am sure\nthat after a little practice with them\nhe could taken good running start\nand at least fly from hill to hill.\nA big barbecue is the thing, so\nlet’s have it. But remember, it\nshould be to celebrate the begin\nning of good roads for Oktibbeha.\nBread Winner.\nA Whited Sepulcre.\nThe following passages are quot\ned from a vile’y libelous article in\nthe Issue of August 12th, signed\nPrank Dallam:\n“There are the revelations in tho\nWhite case, in which it is shown\nthat a member of the legislature,\nnotwithstanding his meagre salary,\ncould have money to squander in\nlargo sums, and in repeated gifts,\non people and in regions where\ndrunkeness and debauchery have\ntheir abiding place and hold their\nrevel,\nDoes not Mr. Percy know the\nstrength of the case against him?\nIt would be an insult to his legal\nacumen to aver that he does not.\nDocs he really not know that the\nstyle of the case is misquoted and\nmisnamed in the inducement and in\nPublic print, and that as a matter\nof fact the stylo of it is not The\nSlate vs L.

Thirty of the princ|\nrailroads of the United States are experimenting with a\nstitute for the telegraph. Eighty have given serious ----I\nation to the subject and a majority have decided to begin|\nchange. These eighty roads operate 211,681 miles of trail\n70 per cent, of the country’s total, and at the present time have 111\nmiles equipped for the new experiment. ■\nThe new means of communication between stations is to be the tl\nphone. For several years railroad officials hare been considering the l|\nphone as a possible substitute for the key in the operation of trains. \\ol\ning was done except in a small way, because there was no way to prove\nevery other person on the line from hearing the message.\nThe invention of the “selector” put the matter in anew light, T\n“selector,” which has been made practicable, is an instrument that mat\nit possible for the central office to communicate with any suhofßce a\nknown to all the other suboffices. The subofliccs to communicate *i\neach other must do so through the central office. Only one set of wii\nis used.\nRecent events have added to the arguments in favor of the tclephoi\nOne of the most effective was the dcision by Judg Kenesaw M. Land\nof the United States court upholding the nine-hour law for railroad ei\nployecs. In order to obey this law the railroads must have an addition\nforce of 15,000 telegraph operators, the estimated salaries of whk\nwould aggregate $10,000,000 a year.\nIt would be far less difficult to secure competent telephone operator\nthe advocates of the telephone train dispatching system contend, bccan\nit would require not more than one-fifth the time for them to qualif\nAnother economical argument in favor of the telephone is that\nthe country districts the offices could be manned by “natives” with jn\nns good, if not better, results than could be obtained by importing opei\ntors. The residents would be willing to accept lower wages in order\nlive at homo. It is estimated by some of the leading railroads that\nsaving of from 15 to 46 per cent, could be effected in this manner.\nIbo recent tieup in Mexico of the national railways because of\nstrike of their American telegraph operators is pointed to as another argr\nniont in favor of the telephone. The possibility of a general traffic pro\ntration would have been averted, the argument goe\nif telephones had been in use, for the telephones coni\nI S have been manned by residents of the country.\n1 i |e perfection of the “selector” is believed I\nhave rn °t the former objection to the telephone tha\n\'*■ "°"ld not be as safe as the telegraph.
