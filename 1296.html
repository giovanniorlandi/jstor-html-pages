Since April\n16, 1914, I have been trying to in\nduce the secretary of commerce to\ninvestigate the inspection service in\norder to compel officials to perform\ntheir duties.\n"In my letters to Mr. Redfield I\ncited case after case in which inspec\ntors had failed to perform their du\nties. Since the Eastland sinking I\nhave tried my best to put this infor\nmation before the public so that any\nattempt to \'whitewash\' the responsi\nble parties might be exposed and\nstopped.

A\nthousand perished. Public anl press\nclamorously insisted the federal\nnavigation laws should be so revised\nthat greed could claim no other sac\nrifice. The laws were not changed.\nA week ago the Eastland overturn\ned at her pier. A thousand perished.\nPublic and press are clamoring for\nchanges in the navigation laws that\nwill insure safety. They will not be\nchanged is the prediction. The pub\nlic will forget its demand.\nAfter public and press now forget\nto plead the cause of safety for sea\nmen and voyagers just as they for\ngot soon after the General Slocum\nhad ceased to be first page news the\nChicago Federation of Labor will re\nshoulder the burden of fighting for\nsafety on the lakes.\nIn two unanimously adopted reso\nlutions the C. F. of L. yesterday sol\nemnly pledged itself to force the issue\nuntil the responsible blame is placed\nfor the Eastland disaster and until\nthe powers that be in Washington are\naroused to the understanding that\nthe lives of seamen and passengers\nare worth considering.\nThe federation wants other unsea\nworthy boats removed from service\nout of Chicago and fears its cry will\nagain fall upon deaf ears.\n\'It is a crime to permit 3,800 peo\nple aboard the Christopher Columbus\nbetween Chicago and Milwaukee,"\nsaid the executive board\'s report,\nwhich said that many hig boats run\nning out of Chicago had not a.sea\nman or practical sailor in the crew.\nThe federation will go direct to\nPresident Wilson. It wants a white\ninvestigation of the Eastland, not a\nwhitewashing one. ft wants an im\nmediate cessatioa of the tactics of\nSec\'v Redfield and what was by one\nfman termed a "farcical self-vindica-\nition investigation,\'\nThe resolution introduced by M. L.\nJohnson and passed asks Pres. Wil\nson to appoint a commission of three\nto give a real investigation, one in\nwhich the people of Chicago can pat\nsome faith. This committee would\nbe composed of a naval expert who is\nnot identified with the steamboat In\nspection service, a Chicago alderman\nand a representative of labor or the\ntraveling public.\nAnother resolution instructed the\nfederation\'s officers to petition Pres.\nWilson to at once thoroughly investi\ngate not only the Eastland disaster\nbut the whole field of steamboat serv\nice inspection and to see that ship\nowners or government inspectors did\nnot escape responsibility. The with\ndrawal of Sec\'y Redfield from Chi\ncago is desired. , ,\nVictor Olander, president of the\nseamen\'s union, was several times\ngiven an ovation.\nr "The federation is not seeking re\nvenge, but protection," it was stated.\n"It wants Uncle Sam to take a les\nson from the Eastland, even if the\nfate of the Gen. Slocum, the Valencia,\nMonroe, Pere Marquette and scores\nof other boats have not brought home\nto him the need for better Inspection\nservice."\n"Sec\'y Redfield\'s sneering, sarcas\ntic, disinterested attitude would get\non the nerves of a Whitechapel mur\nderer," said the executive committee\nin its report" ,\n"Nothing can be gainedSy trjtag\'\nthe devil if the court is-to be held in\nhell," said the committee. A request\nthat Pres. Wilson at once recall Red\nfield and give a real investigation fol\nlowed. "They will plead that the Eastland\nwas different from all other ships,"\nsaid Olander. "They will say such an\naccident can never happen again.\nThey said before that this could not\nhappen. We want regulatioife which\nwill make disasters impossible oo. any', 'jhip. I charge that the Service has\nfailed in duty."\nSec\'y Redfield has insisted that he\nis making as deep an investigation\nas the statutes allow, that it is an\nautomatic investigation such as oc\ncurs after every disaster, and that he\ncan make it no more embracing with\nout running counter with federal law.\nOlander flatly contradicts Redfield by\nsaying the secretary can go the limit\nwith a deep investigation if he\nwants to.\n"I ask\' that the solicitor of his de\npartment, A. L. Thurman, be called\nupon to define the complete power\nof the service he represents. Let him\nbase his reputation as a lawyer on\nthe definition. Then there will not be\nsuch mystery about the power held to\ninvestigate," said Olander.\n"Either the service has power to\nmake a more searching investigation\nor it has exceeded its authority in the\npast There have been thorough in-\nveaugauuua 01 snip disasters, just the\nkind we want here.\n"Time and time again the federa\ntion or myself called the department\'s\nattention to looseness or violations on\nexcursion steamers. The only reply\nwas the stereotyped one: \'The matter\nwill be investigated.\'\n"The power of the steamboat in-\nection service is so great it should\nver nave been entrusted to thp\nhands of men. It should be clearly\ndefined in plainly written law.\n. "How can the Redfield investiga\ntion be fair. The two men who hav.\nthe work of authority, who are con\nducting the hearing and who will gov\nern its findings are two local inspec\ntors. One of them should in reality\nbe on triaL\n"The Redfield investigators have\nnot had me on the stand, though I\nhave been in the same room with\nthem many times."\no o\n\' BRITISH NOTES ARRIVE\nWashington.

A young lady,\nwho said name was Margaret Ryan\nand gave an address in W. 72d st,\nwhich proved fictitious, attracted at\ntention of a number of men last night\nas she sat crying on a bench on a\nsubway platform.\n"Are you in trouble, little girl?" a\nkind man asked her.\n"Yes, kind sir,\' \'she said. "I have\nbeen robbed. Two men in the sub\nway were looking at me and jostling\nme, but I didn\'t pay any attention.\nWhen I got off here I found that -my\nstocking had been cut and $7 taken.\nOuch! Something hurts my foot it\nsticks into me."\nShe took off her shoe and when she\nturned it over a glittering object fell\nout on the platform. -\nUA diamond!" her kind friend said.\n"It\'s worth $200 if it\'s worth a cent"\n\'Til bet it fell off the bad man\'s\nhand when he cut my stocking I no\nticed diamond rings on his fingers,"\nshe said. "Any man can rob me of\n$7 if he will leave a $200 diamond."\nSo she went her way rejoicing and\ndid not report the matter to the po\nlice, satisfied with what she had.\no o\nWOMAN WHO BURIED BABY OF\nDAUGHTER TO GO FREE\nDespite alleged confession of Mrs.\nFrank Schwery, Waukegan, that she\npoisoned Frank Qulgley by putting\narsenic in his ginger ale after she had\nburied the body of an illegitimate\nchild of her daughter without know\ning whether it was dead or alive, she\nmay be freed.\nQuigley will recover.

Great is the\nsorrow among sentimental men pris\noners in the T.ombs. Commissioner\nDavis has spent several thousands of\ndollars in constructing cells to en\nforce a decree which will mean:\nNo more holding hands with wom\nen callers.\nNo more kissing between bars.\nNo more spooning in any form.\nIf you do not believe there has\nbeen such behavior ask Warden Han\nley. Merely because a man had been\ncommitted to a Tombs cell did not\nmean that he could not spend many\npleasant hours with his lady love. The\nonly change was that she had to call\non him, breaking the laws of eti\nquette. She could stay for an hour some\ntimes longer and the mere fact that\nthe prisoner was behind a barred\ndoor lid not prevent some of them\nfrom imagining they were on a\nConey Islanl boat, with the full moon\nmaking the deck just light enough,\nbut not too light ,\no o\nFEDERATION PRAISES WALSH r\nSWELLS LOS ANGELES FUND\nAnton Johanson, former Chicago\nlabor leader, now organizer for the\nSan Francisco building trades coun- j\ncil, addressed the Chicago Federation\nof labor yesterday.

He was in Cleveland\nyesterday preaching; in Euclid Ave\nnue Baptist church. "\nJohn D. Rockefeller was listening.\nAnd the Rev. Johnston Myers from\nChicago, right to Rockefeller\'s face,\nso that America\'s billionaire could\nknow just what Rev. Myers\' opinion\nis, said this:\n"John D. Rockefeller is one of the\ngreatest men living. No man lives\nwho has done as much good in the\nworld as that man."\n"John D. Rockefeller ought to be\nclassed as America\'s greatest butch\ner of labor and the foremost promot\ner of the gunman trade," said Aid.\nWm. Rodriguez to The Day Book to\nday.\nJohn H. Walker, President Illinois\nFederation of Labor: "The greatest\nliving enemy of democracy in citizen\nship and decency of human living in\nthis country is John D. Rockefeller.\nThe Rev. Myers must be looking for\na fat job In the Rockefeller $100,\n000,000 foundation."\nMary O\'Reilly, Executive Board,\nChicago Teachers\' Federation: "It is\ntrue that John D. Rockefeller is\ngreat, but he is great chiefly as a\nmaster corruptionist, working\nthrough a thousand secret sources to\ndefy every principle of a free re\npublic We have uncovered his work\nat enough points to understand how\nhis system works. If the Rev. Myers\nhas read the testimony before the U.\nS. industrial relations commission he\nknows Rockefeller is great as a killer\nof men and robber of labor rather\nthan as a philanthropist."\nJohn D. Farrel, Attorney Wait\nresses\' Union: "I don\'t see on what\nfacts Rev. Myers bases Ills opinion.\nOf course, he was talking face to face\nwith old man Rockefeller himself. If\ngreatness consists in gathering enor\nmous wealth, then John D. is great\nIf hiring gunmen to Mil women and 1\nchildren Is great then John D. is\ngreat"\nEdgar Lee Masters, Attorney Wait\nresses\' Union "As an executive\ngenius of masterly cunning, John D.\nRockefeller must take high rank. If\na great man is also a good man, then\nthe Rev.

But the inves\ntigation fails to show much light on\nthe deficit One trustee says that he\nknows the board will lose vast sums\nof money by the recent laid appraisal\nof school lands on State street But\nhe advises us strongly to accept this\nappraisal, as we will lose more" than\nthis amount if we carry It to court\nduring the long years of litigation, so\nhe claims. And this is all the light\nthe investigation gives on the tremen\ndous loss to the schools owing to\nland leases and the appraisals of\nland on State and Dearborn streets.\nAnother trustee admits that the\nschools lose vast sums of money in\nbuying land sites for schools. Then\nhe says nothing can be done to pre\nvent such "steals." Forget it again!\nAnd the investigation is closed on\nanother cause of a deficit\nBut when they come to speak of\nMrs. Young how their tongues are\nloosened.

I did\nnot even know that there WAS such\na thing as twilight sleep. \'\nWhen I went to Freiburg two years\nago to have my child I found that the\nFreiburg way was called "Dammer\nschlaf," which roughly translated\nmeans "twilight sleep."\nTwilight sleep, I found from my ex\nperience, is easier for the doctor than\nfor the mother to describe, for the\nperiod of my "twilight" is a period\nof ten hours just wiped out of my life.\nI remember the nurse stooping\nover me with the hypodermic needle,\nand I remember waking up in the\nsame dim room with the same quiet\nnurses passing to and fro. I was\nfrightened because the labor had\nstopped an4 1 thought that something\nwas the matter, so when the nurse\ncame to me I told her that labor had\nstopped. She laughed, stepped to a\ntable and brought me my baby. I\nhad brought him into the world en\ntirely by my own efforts and even\nwith some of the expressions of pain\nthat a woman in consciousness uses,\nbut I knew nothing of what I had\nbeen doing!\nMany elements go to produce twi\nlight sleep. The sleep itself is not\nunconsciousness or even semi-con-\'\nsciousness; it is simply instantaneous\nforgetfulness of pain. , One .moment\nyou see the mother crying in pain;\nthe next she will be sleeping so\nsoundly that you cannot believe she\n8s the same woman.\nThe drug element in twilight sleep\nis at first a tiny dose of copolamin,\ntogether with a small dose of mor\nphine. Then the scopolamin is re\npeated .in still tinier doses, but no\nmore morphine is used. The scopola\nmin is only repeated when, by the\nso-called "memory test,\',\' the doctor\nm &mmmwvmmmmmvmmmm m\nMRS.

They either\ndo not know or do not choose to\nknow the difference between their\nown use of scopolamin-morphine and\nthe Freiburg twilight sleep.\nUnder twilight sleep, as used in\nFreiberfi on 5,000 cases and in Amer\nica on at least T ,000, there have been\nno injuries to either the course of la\nbor, the mother or the child.\nQuite the reverse; for, as I shall\nshow in later articles, not only have\nmothers been given ease and comfort\nin childbirth by twilight sleep, but la\nbor has been made more normal by\ntwilight sleep, and mother and child\nhave been protected by it from some\nof the dangers and injuries of birth.\nt\n(What "twilight sleep" means to\nmothers will be discussed in Mrs.\nBoyd\'s next article.)\nDRIED WATERMELON RIND\nCut the rind from melon and re\nmove all red parts; cut white of mel\non into even strips; make a heavy\nsyrup of two pounds of sugar and one\ncup of water; dissolve the sugar\nslowly and put over very low fire to\nrnmo to boil: be careful not to brown\nthe sugar.

On the way to the jail,\nhowever, he happened to notice the\ncigar. It felt soft in the center. He\nsuspected something and investi\ngated.

After a\n20-year fight to oust the street car\ncompany Detroit has won and soon\nwilJ be the biggest city in the United\nStates to have municipally owned\nstreet cars..\nJhe long battle, one of the most\ncar the beginning of the people\'s\nphoto shows the late Hazen S. Pin\nas motorman.\nthrilling of American municipal\nfights, has just ended in an agree\nment between the city\'s street rail\nway commission and the Detroit\nUnited Railway for the purchase of\nthe system by the city at a price to\nbe fixed, some time this fall, by the\nfudges of the circuit courts', 'SHBBIHR\nSRR\nfe--i.\nThe. city already has a cheap fare\nsystem a system of three-cent lines\nin force for some years and a 7 for\n25 cents ticket on its five-cent lines\nsince 1913.\nHere is what Detroit hopes to do\nwith her municipally owned and op\nerated street car lines when she\ngets them:\nEntirely reroute all lines now en\ntering the heart of the city.\nAs rapidly as possible add to the\n1,308 cars now in use.\nUse large cars in place of many of\nthF smaller, old type cars still in use\non some crosstown lines.\nExtend the existing system of\ntracks, of which at present there are\n206 miles, into the suburban districts\nwhere in the past 10 years there has\nbeen an increase in population of\nsome 57 per cent and but little in\ncrease in car service.\nInstallation of a system of "ex\npress" cars to be run without inter\nmediate stops between heavily con\ngested points in the city.\nDesignate certain streets to be\nused exclusively for vehicle traffic,\nthus allowing street cars on the other\nthoroughfares faster running time.\nThe possible construction of a $16,-\n000,000 subway alongWoodward av.,\nDetroit\'s main thoroughfare.\nTo give the conductors and motor\nmen the hest wages and working con\nditions possible.\nAnd to keep the fare as low as good\nservice permits.\nDissatisfaction with \'the service\nstarted the fight back in 1895 when\nHazen S. Pingree, later governor of\nMichigan, was mayor. The first big\nmove was the establishment of threer\ncent fare lines in competition with the\nfive-cent lines. The resultant fight\nhas involved 50 companies.\nThe hopes of competition were\ndoomed, however, when the com\npanies combined in 1900. The people\nretail aiea dv reiusmg to sanction\new franshises or allow extensions on\nosb expiring.\nMayor George P.

Barcrof t,\nformer railroad mair-and a famous\nconsulting engineer. Barcroft, not a\nhit awed by the fact that Bion J. Ar\nnold, famous traction expert, was re\ntained by the company, chose his ex\nperts, mostly outsiders he could trust,\nand started appraising.\nThe company fought hard. Papers\nand important records disappeared.\nBarcroft and his committee finally\nmade a valuation of some $11,000,\n000. The company protested that\n$24,000,000 was the lowest estimate\nthey would even consider.\nThe committee of 50 aghast at the\nhole they had fallen into "accepted,"\nbut would not "adopt" the Barcroft\nappraisal.\nThis action killed Breitmeyer\'s ad\nministration, but meanwhile the city\nfound it necessary to change its\ncharter before it could even get the\nright to try to oust the company. The\nbattle was carried to the state legis\nlature and by 1910 the city had ob\ntained home rule.\nIn 1912, with the company beaten\nat practically every point, the city in\ncreased the daily rental of the streets\nto $600, but when Mayor Oscar B.\nMarx also demanded a lower fare the\ncompany balked.\nThe mayor threatened to have the\npolice stop the cars, and James Cou\nzens, general manager of the Ford\ncompany, offered to use all surplus\nautos on hand to carry citizens about\nthe city.\nThis marked the beginning of the\nend for the company. A street rail\nway commission of three was ap\npointed to handle the situation and\nwork out a plan whereby the city\ncould purchase the property. The\nmen on the committee are James\nCouzens, general manager of the\nFord company; J. F. Dodge of Dodge\nand company.\nA new appraisal was made in 1914\nand was placed at $20,000,000 on\nsome 206 miles of car lines. Again\nthe company balked and the city\'s\noffer was raised to $24,000,000.\nThen it was discovered that there\nwere $1,600,000 worth of car bonds\nstill in the company\'s treasury. The\ncity insisted these be deducted from\nthe offer of $24,000,000. Again the .\ncompany balked. -\nThe city then offered to let the cir-\ncuit court arbitrate and decide the c\nquestion and gave the company until\nJuly 6 for a final answer.\nAt the last moment the company\ngave it and now except for a few\nminor details, Detroit has come into -municipal\nownership.\no o\nFREIBERG\'S PAINTED GREEN\nREADY FOR RED OPENING -\nHinged upon a coat of paint, the re\nport that the 22d st levee district will\nbe re-opened soon is gaining strength.\nThe new emerald tint that has been v\ngiven to Freiberg\'s dance hall, last -v\nclosed of the notorious dive places, t\nstarted the rumor.\nIt has been quietly noised about the - ?\n22d st. neighborhood that other plac\nes are making preparations for a -\n"busy season."

"No, dear, I have not learned any\nmore about you than I have about\nmyself, but I have found out in my\nfive years of married life that most\nmen who are married to good women\nwomen who from a sense of their\nhusband\'s honor or respect for them\nselves decline to accept any attention\nfrom men 6ther than their husbands,\nare supposed by those same hus\nbands to be devoid of the natural in\nclinations which make the society of\nmen the most interesting society in\nthe world to women."\n"But, my dear Margie, don\'t you\nhave a good time with your own sex?\nMen can have the bulliest time pos\nsible with each other."\n"Yes, of course I can, but I don\'t\nwant to flock with women all the\ntime. I\'d like to ask you if, when you\nare out with the boys, as you call it,\nthere is ever a time that some refer\nence to women does not enter into\nthe conversation, and if you always\nfeel that you must forego the society\nof other women because you have a \'\nwife at home?"\n"Why, my dear, at Eliene\'s tonight\nthat uncle of Harry\'s, who is 60 if\nhe is a day, and who has a comfort-\nLable middle-aged wife and two grown\nup children, recounted with great\nglee that the day before he had taken\na 20-year-old girl, a friend of his\ndaughter, to luncheon, and how every\none of his pals came up to be intro\nduced to her."\n"Oh, Margie, why not let the old\nguy have a good time?
