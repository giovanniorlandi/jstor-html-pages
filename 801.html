The Asian does \nnot feel so divided from his communist enemy as he does from his Western \nfriend.”  Our introductory article analyzes China’s role in Asia; and five sub\xad\nsequent studies evaluate the foreign policies and internal developments of \nMainland China.\nChina in Asia\nBy C . P . FitzG erald\nProfessor of Far Eastern History, Australian National University\nA\n c o m m o n  fallacy underlies much \nof the contemporary discussion of \nChina and her problems. Follow\xad\ning the doctrine of “containment,” it is as\xad\nsumed that China can and rightly should be \nexpected to exist politically within the present \nfrontiers of the People’s Republic-—even \nTibet is called in question— without any claim \nto further influence. History is almost ig\xad\nnored; geography is barely considered; and \nthe inevitable political consequences are \ntreated as if they were the peculiar evil prop\xad\nerty of the present government in Peking.\nBut history and geography cannot be ig\xad\nnored, except at the peril o f forming false \njudgments and formulating unworkable poli\xad\ncies. China lies at the heart of eastern Asia; \nshe has had a very long relationship with her \nneighbors, o f peace and war, trade and mi\xad\ngration; and these aspects of east Asian his\xad\ntory must be taken into consideration.\nIn ancient times the peoples whom the \nChinese called Yueh, a word still familiar in \nthe southern dialect form of “Viet,”  lived \nalong the whole southeastern coast of China, \nand probably in the adjacent islands also.\nThey were seafarers who migrated southward \ninto what is now Vietnam (“ Yueh Nan, \nSouthern Yueh,”  in standard Chinese). \nM ny of the Yueh people remained on the \nsouth China coast and in historical times were \ngradually incorporated into the Chinese em\xad\npire after the the first century B.C. Ethni\xad\ncally, therefore, there is a close affinity be\xad\ntween the southern Chinese and the Viet\xad\nnamese, and this is still evident in their \nlanguage.\nThe movement and history of the Yueh \npeople can be compared to the very similar \nmigrations, a thousand years later, o f another \nseafaring people, the Norsemen. They, too, \nspread along the northwest coasts of Europe \nand mingled with the peoples inhabiting \nBritain, Ireland, northwest France, Holland \nand Scandinavia, their original home. Today \nthe affinity among these modern nations is \nstill conspicuous. So it is also in the Far East, \nin the lands of the ancient Yueh folk.\nAfter China had absorbed the coastal prov\xad\ninces, there was a long period during which \nshe also ruled over what is now called North \nVietnam, then known as Tongking. As time\n', '130 • CU RRE N T H ISTO RY, SEPTEM BER, 1967\npassed, the distance from the Chinese court \nof this remote province and the distinctive \n“ Viet, or Yueh,”  characteristics of its inhabi\xad\ntants made them impatient of Chinese rule. \nThey frequently revolted; finally, in the \neleventh century, the Chinese government \nrecognized that the Viet province could be \nbetter governed under an autonomous tribu\xad\ntary king, who would rule as he pleased in his \nown country, but would pay more or less \nnominal allegiance to the ruling Chinese \ndynasty. This pattern persisted under many \nchanges of regime in Peking down to the \nFrench conquest of Vietnam in the last quar\xad\nter of the nineteenth century. Thus the his\xad\ntorical relationship between Vietnam and \nChina was first direct Chinese rule, then in\xad\ndirect Chinese suzerainty. The history of \nKorea offers a similar story, the only differ\xad\nence being that at the end of the nineteenth \ncentury it was Japan, rather than a European \npower, that terminated Chinese suzerainty in \nKorea and imposed foreign colonial rule.\nEARLY RULE IN ASIA\nVietnam was a special case; it adjoins \nChina and ethnic and cultural connections \nare close. Until French rule was imposed, \nthe Vietnamese wrote in Chinese characters \nand their literature was a branch of that of \nChina. Their political system was closely \nmodeled on the Chinese monarchy; their \nethical system was Confucianism; the popular \nreligion was the Chinese form of Buddhism.\nElsewhere in south Asia the relationship to \nChina was not so close. Cambodia, Laos and \nThailand and, beyond these, Burma, derived \ntheir original culture from India, and with it, \nfirst Brahmanism, then the Theravada branch \nof Buddhism, which also flourishes in Ceylon. \nSanskrit was their sacred classical language, \nnot Chinese. This was also true in Java and \nSumatra, until the Muslim conversion of these \ncountries in the thirteenth and fourteenth \ncenturies A.D.\nThe rest of Indonesia, the “ outer islands,”  \nwere settled and civilized after the Muslim \nconversion. In these countries China had \nonly an indirect influence, but it was at times \na powerful one. In the earlier centuries,\nChina seems to have confined her interests \nto trade and the seasonal visits of merchants. \nThe Mongol conquerors of the Sung Chinese \ndynasty attempted to extend their direct rule \nto Vietnam, Burma and also Java. These \ncampaigns were defeated mainly by the \ntropical climate and the unfamiliar jungle \nterrain which were unsuited to Mongol cav\xad\nalry tactics. After these vain attempts, the \nMongols, too, contented themselves with su\xad\nzerainty.\nWhen the Ming Chinese dynasty replaced \nthe Mongols, early in the fifteenth century, \nthey embarked on an extensive program of \nnaval power and overseas expeditions, partly \nmilitary, partly diplomatic. Large fleets \nsailed south and imposed Chinese suzerainty \nin Java, Malaya, Thailand, Burma and Cey\xad\nlon. Kings who resisted were deposed and \nmore amenable monarchs were substituted. \nChina’s fleets ranged across the Indian Ocean \nto the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and east \nAfrican coast, but in these distant lands their \nmission was diplomacy and trade, not con\xad\nquest. This unique burst of Chinese mari\xad\ntime activity lasted 30 years, and was brought \nto an end by changes of policy at home, not \nby resistance abroad from either the south\xad\neast Asia peoples or outside powers. It was \n70 years and more before Vasco de Gama \nrounded the Cape of Good Hope.\nChina has therefore had a long history of \nrelations with the peoples of southeast Asia; \nin later centuries the relationship took on a \nnew form— the massive immigration o f Chi\xad\nnese into these countries. This had begun \nas early as the twelfth century but became \nlarge-scale only when the colonial rule of \nEuropean powers had developed the markets \nand created the need for labor in these re\xad\ngions. Today, it is the presence of large \nChinese communities in southeast Asia, usu\xad\nally in control of important sections of the \neconomy, that constitutes the “ Chinese prob\xad\nlem”  for the states which have succeeded the \ncolonial powers. That it also creates a re\xad\nlationship with China, which could be uneasy \nand might be dangerous, is evident. Recent \nevents in Indonesia illustrate this point.\nThe strength of China in the lands beyond\n', "China in Asia •  131\nher southern frontier and beyond the South \nChina Sea is thus a compound of historical \nrelationships, demographic factors and geo\xad\ngraphical propinquity; only to a lesser degree \nis it based on cultural influence and immedi\xad\nate political or military power. China will \nalways be in the area and has always been \nthere; sometimes active, somedmes disin\xad\nterested or too troubled at home to exercise \nher latent strength, she has been a factor \nnever to be discounted, certain to reappear.\nThese considerations impel a highly intelli\xad\ngent ruler like Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia \nto steer a careful course through present strife \nand to seek, if possible, a recognized and \nrespected neutrality. His problem and that \no f his neighbors is how far to equate Chinese \ninfluence, which must always be present, with \ncommunist ideology, which may not remain \ndie dominant force in China or, if it remains, \nmay take new and unexpected forms. This, in\xad\ndeed, is the problem which all nations in\xad\nvolved in east Asia must consider and resolve \nif their policies are to prove effective in the \nlong run.\nCHINA'S AIMS\nThe question, what are the policy aims of \nthe present Chinese government in this part \nof the world, is complicated by the prior ques\xad\ntion, whether there is only one Chinese policy, \nor two; a Chinese nadonal policy and a com\xad\nmunist policy, which may run in harness part \no f the way, but may diverge at other points. \nAs far as the evidence goes it would suggest \nthat there are in fact two policies, and that \nthey are successive, rather than concurrent. \nThe first, the policy of Chinese national in\xad\nterests, is aimed at a restoration in modern \nform of the old suzerain-tributary relationship \nwhich functioned for so long and, from the \nChinese point o f view, so well, for many cen\xad\nturies. This seems to the Chinese the “ na\xad\ntural”  relationship between the major and \nthe minor powers. M inor Asian powers \nshould move in China’s orbit, just as the small \nrepublics of Central America move in that of \nthe United States, or as the small powers of \nWestern Europe used to conform to the poli\xad\ncies of France or Britain.\nThis Chinese policy would therefore seek to \nsee regimes similar to that o f China estab\xad\nlished in all these countries: ideally, com \xad\nmunist; next best, “ fellow traveling,”  as in \nBurma; also acceptable, nonaligned, or neu\xad\ntral, as in Cambodia. Attachment to tire \nUnited States by alliance or by offering the \nuse o f bases is, to the Chinese, unacceptable.\nIn the view o f  the Chinese Communists, \nthere is certainly a further policy beyond or \nconcurrent with this— the promotion by ex\xad\nample and encouragement o f communist-in- \nspired-and-led revolution in all those coun\xad\ntries where and when the time seems ripe. In \nthe view o f every communist the time will \ncertainly come because the “ contradictions” \nof the capitalist system will inevitably \nbring this denouement. The questions are: \nwhen, and what, can be done to hasten the \nday? In one sense, this policy is purely ideo\xad\nlogical; it postulates the inevitability o f com\xad\nmunism, but fixes no dates. I f it were noth\xad\ning but an aspiration, the world as a whole \nwould have little need to complain. W e have \nlong been accustomed to messianic creeds \nwhich promise, or expect, the conversion of \nthe whole world in due course: and we know \nthat the course is very long, if, indeed, it is \nnot infinite.\nThe urgency and reality o f the Chinese \nCommunist policy lie in the fact that in many \ncountries the economic and social systems \nare so decayed and distorted that some kind of \nrevolutionary change is most probable. Can \nthis change be effected, as the West would \nlike to hope, by aid, protection against com\xad\nmunism, and the promotion of democratic \nforms of government, or must it follow the \nChinese model? The Chinese Communists \nhave no doubts; to them, the alternatives are \nnot viable. The possessing class will renounce \nneither wealth nor power unless compelled by \nforce. Aid can touch only the fringe o f the \nproblem, and will be misapplied by corrupt \nrulers; foreign protection (or occupation as \nthey see it) will only arouse the national feel\xad\nings o f the peasants and make them see the \nforeign power as the protector of their land\xad\nlords and corrupt rulers. Thus there is a \npractical communist expectancy of results ob\xad\n", '132 C U R R E N T H IS T O R Y , SE P TE M B E R , 1967\ntainable in measurable time, as well as a \nmore distant truly ideological hope that “ one \nday”  all the world will be converted to com \xad\nmunism. Clearly, the Chinese national \npolicy of restoring China’s primacy in her \nformer tributaries, and the communist policy \nof promoting revolution in the same countries \ncan and do go a long way together.\nPOLICY AND POSSIBILITIES\nPolicy is one thing; possibility is another. \nVery few great policies have been fully real\xad\nized. After a century, the Monroe Doctrine \nhas still left several parts o f the American \ncontinents in allegiance to foreign, non- \nAmerican powers. The Crusades failed to \ndestroy the Muslim religion, or even to hold \nthe Holy Land. Islam failed to conquer \nEurope. More recently, the European \npowers, who seemed even 30 years ago so \nsecure in their colonial empires in Asia and \nin Africa, have lost virtually all these coun\xad\ntries and no longer expect or wish to recover \nthem.\nThere is no historical reason to suppose that \ncommunism has a magic which Christianity \nand Islam lacked, or that China has or will \nhave the power to impose lasting rule over \nalien peoples when all previous examples \nhave proved how transitory such power is. \nThe conflict of Russia and China in their in\xad\nterpretation o f communism also shows, as \nshould have been expected, that an ideologi\xad\ncal creed is always subject to the dangers of \nheresy, controversy and doctrinal dispute, and \nthat these divisions frequently coincide with \nethnic and cultural differences which make \nthem irreconcilable. Thus there are very \nreal obstacles in the path of Chinese policy, \nbut these lie more in the way of the communist \nideological policy than in that o f the national \npolicy aimed to secure Chinese national in\xad\nterests.\nThe ideal o f worldwide communist revolu\xad\ntion already seems utopian. The first ques\xad\ntion is: which form o f communism is to win \nthe victory, the Russian, or that of Chairman \nM ao Tse-tung? Until this internal dispute \nis resolved there can be no unity of purpose \nor certainty of operation. And there is at\npresent no sign at all that the dispute can be \ncomposed; rather it grows sharper. This in \neffect means that the ideological policy of the \nChinese Communists must now be subordi\xad\nnated to the policy of Chinese national in\xad\nterests. China cannot convert Russia, nor \ncan she win the East European Communist \ncountries to her side. They are willing \nenough to use the dispute to gain influence \nand free themselves from too close a Russian \ncontrol, but this does not mean any disposition \nto accept the leadership o f China instead. \nThe Indonesian revolution of 1965 has shown \nalso that in some of the southeast Asian \ncountries there are factors which militate \nagainst Chinese influence and policy. One \nof these factors is precisely the size and poten\xad\ntial power of China herself. Many Indo\xad\nnesians felt that a communist regime would \nsubordinate Indonesian interests to Chinese \ninfluence and control. A  second factor is the \nethnic difference between Chinese and Indo\xad\nnesians, which emphasizes the economic posi\xad\ntion of the local Chinese and the long-stand\xad\ning communal animosities between the two \npeoples. In all the Muslim countries these \nfactors are present, and create great obstacles \nfor Chinese policy.\nIt is, o f course, always possible that the \nnow dominant anti-Chinese and anti-com\xad\nmunist leadership in these countries will fail to \ncure their very great social and economic \nmaladies. These leaders do not appear to \nbe making significant progress in either field. \nIf they fail, there will certainly be a revolu\xad\ntion in favor o f the only alternative, the com\xad\nmunists. Whether China can play that hand \nskillfully, or clumsily, only the event would \nshow. In countries where Islam is not domi\xad\nnant and where the pattern o f culture is closer \nto China— the Buddhist countries of Burma, \nThailand, Cambodia and Laos— the Chinese \nmodel is more potent and the fact that all of \nthem either adjoin China or are separated \nfrom her territory only by narrow strips of \nthinly populated jungle country makes her \ninfluence much more direct and her power \nmore positive than it can be across the seas. \nIn theory it is possible for China to invade \nand occupy all these continental countries\n', 'China in Asia •  133\nwith her present armaments and forces. It \nis not practical for China to mount any over\xad\nseas expedition; her forces are not equipped \nfor such an operation. In Australia, this last \nfact has been largely concealed from the read\xad\ning public by self-interested politicians ready \nto exploit popular fears and prejudices, but it \nis axiomatic and accepted by informed Ameri\xad\ncan and European opinion.\nLIMITS ON CHINESE POLICY\nThere are, therefore, physical limits to any \nforceful application o f Chinese policy, be it \nideological or national. It is at least very \npossible that the Chinese also see other limi\xad\ntations that preclude the use o f military force \nto achieve their aims. The Chinese believe \nthat social conditions in the countries near \ntheir southern border will soon engender a \nrevolutionary movement. They have only to \nwait; they see the decline o f these economies, \nthe rise of the cost of living, the increasing \npoverty of the peasants; if not now, they be\xad\nlieve that these conditions will inevitably \ncome soon.\nThat revolution cannot be exported is a \nfirm Chinese Communist doctrine, just as it \nwas the teaching o f Lenin. The Chinese \nhave acted on this belief. They did not \ncreate the Vietnamese Communist movement, \nit came into existence and into power in the \nNorth some years before the Chinese Com \xad\nmunists controlled the adjacent parts of \nChina. It was Generalissimo Chiang Kai- \nshek who put H o Chi Minh into power in \nHanoi. The Communist Party of Indonesia, \nwhether it really planned to seize power in \nSeptember, 1965, or only to ride gently into \npower on the back o f President Sukarno, was \nan Indonesian movement having roots in the \n1920’s and 1930’s and its membership was \nIndonesian, not Chinese. The Chinese Com \xad\nmunists believe that a regime such as that of \nGeneral Suharto cannot survive, and that it \nwill in turn produce conditions favorable to \nthe resurrection of the Indonesian Communist \nParty. They also believe that if Aidit and \nother Indonesian Communist leaders were \nhoping to win power by “ legal”  means \nthrough the medium o f President Sukarno,\nthey were making a fundamental error in \nstrategy and doctrine. There is no “ parlia\xad\nmentary road”  to revolution; power must be \nseized; it “ grows from the barrel o f a gun.” \nHistorical evidence supports this dictum ; it is \nhard to find any regime in the world whose \npower did not originally come from the barrel \no f a gun.\nThe Chinese can count on other advantages \nin their strategy of waiting. First, they are \ngoing to be in the area, however long the wait. \nSecond, overseas powers are subject to the \nchanges of fortune that events elsewhere may \ndictate. Britain once dominated the Eastern \nSeas; so, after her, did Japan. The Chinese \nprobably take into account the fact that the \nUnited States has worldwide interests, some \nof which are of far greater importance to the \nUnited States than Vietnam could ever be; \nsome change, some crisis, might bring these \ninterests into danger and then the new situa\xad\ntion would receive priority, just as Britain was \nforced out o f the Far East by the German \nthreat, and not by local nationalism. This \nno doubt explains why Chinese words and \nactions do not match. The words are rough \nand harsh; the actions are moderate and cau\xad\ntious. The United States is denounced in \nvery strong terms, but China takes great care \nnot to provoke military incidents, and has not \nreacted violently to such accidental incur\xad\nsions by air as the United States forces have \nfrom time to time acknowledged.\nThere are also the advantages which the \nChinese may reap from factors that are not \nthe product o f any Chinese policy. The \nChinese are an Asian people; as such they \nhave the sympathy and understanding which \ngo with ethnic affinity and cultural relation\xad\nship. However much the Europeans and \nAmericans are divided among themselves, or \nfrom the Russians, they still feel a relation\xad\nship, a kinship, both o f race and culture; so \nthe Asian peoples, especially those of the Far \nEast, feel the same way. The emotional \nidentification is largely indefinable, but very \nreal. The Chinese thus see that the foreign, \nWestern intervener, no matter in what cause \nhe comes, will always be a figure of doubt and \ndislike to the Asians. The memory o f co \xad\n', '134 • CU RRE N T HISTORY^ SEPTEM BER, 1967\nlonial rule is very sharp and very recent. \nThe Asian does not feel so divided from his \ncommunist enemy as he does from his West\xad\nern friend. This is one of the painful facts \nof international relations which many are un\xad\nwilling to admit. In this respect, the Chinese \nhave a real advantage; they do not send their \ntroops across the frontiers, they have learned \nthat such action is never popular and often \ndisastrous. They help their friends, but not \nwith armed and visible soldiery.\nMILITARY POWER\nOn the military side, the Chinese may be \nwell advised to act with caution, for in fact \nthey are not so strong as they are often \nthought to be, and they are aware of this. The \nprogress of Chinese nuclear fission experi\xad\nments and the detonation of a hydrogen bomb \nin early June, 1967, should not distract at\xad\ntention from other aspects of Chinese military \npower. The Chinese do not possess a navy \nable in any way to challenge the power of the \nUnited States; thus they cannot mount any \noverseas expedition, even against Taiwan. \nMost Chinese naval craft arc built for coastal \nwaters, and are defensive in character. They \nare designed to frustrate a Nationalist raid \nfrom Taiwan rather than to mount an in\xad\nvasion o f that island.\nThe Chinese air force is equally defensive, \nwith very few bombers able to cross the seas \naround China, and none of great range. The \nfighter aircraft are short-range, designed for \ndefense against intruders. All Chinese air\xad\ncraft are relatively obsolescent, because of the \nquarrel with Russia and the slow process of \nmaking the air force independent of Russian \nprototypes and replacements. Conventional \nChinese land forces are very large— although \nnot unduly large for so vast a country and so \ngreat a population. The incidence o f con\xad\nscription on a population of 700 million is \nslight. It is unlikely that most o f the Chinese \nland forces are equipped with weapons as \nsophisticated as those o f the United States; \nthe majority are line regiments and armor is \nrelatively scarce.\nIn military terms, this means that China’s \narmed forces are geared for defense, not ag\xad\ngression. This, o f course, is precisely what \nthe Chinese government always claims is their \nsole function. Military facts confirm it. In \ndefense, the Chinese would be formidable; \ntheir numbers are very great, they know the \nterrain, and would have the full cooperation \no f the population. There is every reason to \nthink that any invasion of China, even if ac\xad\ncompanied by a heavy air attack, would be a \nprofitless exercise. The bombing of the small \ntarget area of North Vietnam has failed to \nproduce the expected results; the bombing of \nthe vast area of continental China could \nhardly be anything but ineffective.\nOnly nuclear attack could seriously disrupt \nChinese defenses. Nuclear power will not \nfor long be an American and Russian mo\xad\nnopoly in the Far East. Estimates vary, but \nthere is no doubt that the pace of China’s \ndevelopment of her nuclear armament has \noutstripped expectations in the West— or at \nleast the expectations which were given to the \ngeneral public. Therefore, the Chinese have \nanother and compelling reason for present \ncaution. Every passing year brings them \nnearer to the day when they will be able to \nretaliate in kind if subjected to nuclear at\xad\ntack. Already nothing short o f nuclear at\xad\ntack could destroy their defenses or lead to \ndefeat in war. In another ten years, or per\xad\nhaps less, they will no longer, as they put it, \n“ be subject to nuclear blackmail by the U.S.A. \nand U.S.S.R.”\nIt docs not follow that, having escaped \nfrom that situation themselves, they would at \nonce be ready to put others in the same posi\xad\ntion. It cannot be assumed that China will \nbe the only nuclear Asian power in 1975. \nJapan and India may feel it necessary to enter \n( Continued on page 175)\nC. P. FitzGerald lived in China from 1923 to \n1929, and later from 1946 to 1950; he visited \nagain in 1956 and 1958. He is the author of \nThe Chinese View of Their Place in the \nWorld (New York: Oxford University Press, \n1954), Birth of Communist China (New \nYork: Praeger, 1964), and A Concise History \nof East Asia (New York: Praeger, 1966), \namong other works.\n', 'C H IN A  I N  A SIA\n( Continued from page 134)\nthe lists. There is very little real probability \nof a major Chinese quarrel with either of \nthese powers. From India, China has taken \nwhat she considers her own, and what she \nwanted— certain frontier areas and passes. \nIt is doubtful (although much Indian opinion \nwill not agree) that China has any further \nambitions in respect to India. The Indian \nCommunist Party does not offer a very hope\xad\nful prospect in the country as a whole, in \nspite o f local success in Kerala. China would \ncertainly not want to take large Indian terri\xad\ntories and be responsible for their administrar \ntion; her reluctance to be led by military \nsuccess into such a position was clearly \ndemonstrated by the unilateral ceasefire and \nwithdrawal from invaded regions which the \nChinese carried out immediately after their \nvictory in 1962.\nThe Chinese attitude toward Japan is am\xad\nbivalent. Trade is important, and a large \nJapanese commercial and industrial lobby—  \ncapitalist rather than socialist— works actively \nand openly for an expansion of trade with \nChina and diplomatic relations with Peking. \nThe Japanese Communist Party is small, \nweak, and not likely to become a serious revo\xad\nlutionary force. Having attained an indus\xad\ntrial strength through capitalism, Japan is \nfundamentally different from the other na\xad\ntions o f the Far East. It has not at present \nthe makings of a revolutionary situation, and \nthe Chinese know very well that foreign en\xad\ncouragement would hamper rather than help \nthe Japanese Communist Party. Japan is \nnot a military power o f the first rank, and \nthere is strong antimilitarist sentiment in the \ncountry. This is reassuring for China; but \nJapan has the industrial and technological \nstrength to become a nuclear power swiftly \nand effectively. In such event, Chinese views \ncould change. The memory of past invasions \nstill exists. China clearly aims to encourage \nthose forces in Japan which wish to loosen the \nties with the United States and assume a \npolicy of full neutrality; it is the best China\ncan hope for in Japan, and it is not a vain \nhope.\nThis assessment of China’s role in Asia is \nbased on what is known o f present policy and \nresources, not on what policy may be or what \nfurther resources could be available ten years \nfrom now. Ten years is a long time; in that \nperiod, on past experience, there can be sur\xad\nprising reversals of alliances, wholly un\xad\nexpected developments, changes o f regime \nand of strength. The enemy o f yesterday is \noften the friend o f today. Present policies \nand power seem to preclude any dramatic \nChinese assault upon the Western nations, al\xad\nthough they favor a constant attrition and \nundermining o f Western power in the Far \nEast. The gazer into the crystal ball can see \nonly a cloudy and uncertain picture o f the \nfuture.\nArticles Concluded •  175\nC H IN A ’S A M E R IC A N  P O L IC Y\n( Continued from page 140 )\nFurthermore, by following the strategy of \nconflict management, China has not been \nforced to pay the price of Sino-Soviet cooper\xad\nation which the Liu-Lo-P ’eng line would have \nentailed.\nThe M ao-Lin-Chou strategy is essentially \na cautious strategy, but it should not be in\xad\nferred that China will under no circumstances \nintervene in Vietnam.
