        <pre>['139\nPERSPECTIVE\nThe Atlantic alliance has made a remarkable\nrecovery over the course of President \nGeorge W. Bush’s second term. Relations \nbetween the United States and Europe hit rock \nbottom after the us-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, \nraising the prospect of an irreparable transatlantic \nrift. Although the war won grudging support from \nsome European governments, it was staunchly \nopposed by many of the continent’s citizens. Acrimony\nand recriminations engulfed diplomacy as \nwell as public debate. The Atlantic community \nfaced its most serious crisis since World War II.\nThis crisis and the charged rhetoric that accompanied\nit have since abated. Over the past three \nyears, the Bush administration and its European \ncounterparts have worked hard to mend fences—\nwith impressive results. And it is not only the \natmospherics that have changed. The United States \nand its European partners are fighting together in \nAfghanistan. They are working jointly to rein in \nIran’s nuclear program, negotiate peace between \nIsraelis and Palestinians, and ease Kosovo toward \nformal independence.\nFrom the European perspective, the Bush \nadministration continues to fall short of expectations\non several fronts—especially curbing climate \nchange. But even on this issue, which President \nBush effectively dismissed during his first term, \nWashington has now moved forward, agreeing to \nmultilateral negotiations over a successor to the \nKyoto Protocol and supporting measures to reduce \nconsumption of fossil fuels.\nRecognizing Reality\nThe improvement in Atlantic relations has \nbeen a matter of necessity, not choice. The Bush \nadministration once thought the United States \nwas strong enough to run the world on its own. \nThe debacle in Iraq proved otherwise. For their \npart, many Europeans initially welcomed a distancing\nfrom Washington. With the end of the \ncold war and with the European Union’s growing\neconomic and political muscle, it was time—\nthe argument went—for the eu to countenance \nlife without its American guardian. But with the \nAtlantic link on the verge of being severed, the eu \nsoon found itself adrift and deeply divided. Both \nAmericans and Europeans, after getting a glimpse \nof what it would be like to go it alone, realized \nthey remained each other’s best partners.\nRecognition of this strategic reality was \nreflected in—but also fostered by—changes in key \nleadership positions on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIn Washington, though President Bush and \nVice President Dick Cheney remained in charge, \ntheir top echelon of foreign advisers changed \ndramatically. Out were Paul Wolfowitz, John Bolton,\nDouglas Feith, Donald Rumsfeld, and others \nresponsible for the ideological excesses of the first \nterm. In were Condoleezza Rice, Robert Zoellick, \nRobert Kimmitt, Robert Gates, and others associated\nwith a more pragmatic and centrist brand \nof internationalism.\nIn Europe, elections rather than political \nappointments were the main driver of change. \nBush’s main allies in Europe—Tony Blair in \nGreat Britain, José María Aznar in Spain, and Silvio\nBerlusconi in Italy—all lost the confidence \nof their citizens and are no longer in office. But \nalso gone are Gerhard Schröder of Germany and \nJacques Chirac of France, the two leaders who led \nthe charge against the Iraq War. Curiously, these \nleaders’ successors—Angela Merkel in Berlin and \nNicolas Sarkozy in Paris—are far more Atlanticist \nand pro-American than were their predecessors. \nBoth Merkel and Sarkozy campaigned primarily \non domestic issues, not foreign policy. But it nonetheless\nspeaks volumes that even after the ill will \ntoward the United States provoked by the Iraq War, \nboth Germans and Frenchmen voted into office \nleaders intent on repairing Atlantic relations.\nThe White House no doubt misses Blair, its \nmost stalwart ally, especially because his successor, \nPrime Minister Gordon Brown, has been keeping \nCharles a. KupChan is a professor of international affairs at \nGeorgetown University and a senior fellow at the Council on \nForeign Relations.\nThe Transatlantic Turnaround\nCharles a. KupChan\n', '140 •\u2002 CURRENT\u2002HISTORY\u2002 •\u2002 March\u20022008\nhis distance from the Bush administration. On balance,\nhowever, Washington has more leverage in \nEurope today than it did when Blair was in office. \nWorking through London had a major drawback \nfor the United States: Britain’s own reluctance to \nintegrate fully into the eu (the United Kingdom, \nfor example, remains outside the euro zone) means \nthat its influence in Europe is limited. Washington\nin this respect is better off dealing directly \nwith Berlin and Paris, long the dual locomotives of \nEuropean integration, instead of working through \nits offshore ally.\nThis year’s election in the United States has the \npotential to advance further the repair of the Atlantic\nlink. President Bush, despite the conciliatory \novertures of his second term, remains a singularly \nunpopular figure in Europe. The bitter legacy of the \nIraq War, Bush’s stingy approach to fighting climate \nchange, his refusal to negotiate with Iran, his policies\non treatment of \ndetainees—all these \ncontinue to generate \nire. Should the Democrats\nprevail in the \npresidential contest, \ntransatlantic relations \nare poised to receive a \nnew boost. Indeed, Europe awaits with bated breath \nthe arrival of a Democrat in the White House.\nHigH expectations\nAlthough a change of leadership in Washington \nwill no doubt brighten the prospects for transatlantic\ncomity, both Americans and Europeans \nshould keep their expectations in check. A Democratic\nadministration would not be satisfied with \njust a warm welcome from Europe; the new us \ngovernment would also expect the Europeans to \nshoulder more international burdens. In the probably\ncorrect belief that the eu had not gone out of \nits way to do favors for the Bush administration, \na Democratic White House would seek greater \nEuropean assistance in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nother trouble areas. The Democratic candidates, \nafter all, are promising the electorate that the \nUnited States will benefit not just from renewed \nrespect abroad, but also from a reduction in the \nnation’s onerous overseas commitments.\nSome such help may be forthcoming from \nEurope—but not much. eu member states simply\ndo not have the personnel and military assets \nneeded to undertake a substantial expansion of \ntheir missions abroad. To be sure, the union is in \nthe midst of reforming its institutions in order to \nallow greater coherence on foreign policy. But that \nproject will advance only slowly. And as casualties \nmount in Afghanistan, eu member states will find \nthe war increasingly unpopular—even if a Democrat\ncontrols the White House.\nMeanwhile, Europeans will be expecting an \nabout-face in foreign policy from a Democratic \nadministration. Yet, \nwhile some change \nwill be in the offing, \nthe next us president \nwill not hold a strong \nhand of cards. Wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan,\ninstability and \nextremist violence in Pakistan, nuclear ambitions \nin Iran, an economic downturn at home, a deeply \ndivided electorate—these inauspicious conditions\nwill constrict the administration’s room \nfor maneuver as it seeks to pursue a new brand \nof statecraft.\nAn ebullient transatlantic reunion may be in \nstore come January 2009. But then the hard realities\nof transatlantic cooperation will set in. The \ngood news is that Americans and Europeans alike \nhave realized that they will need each other for the \nforeseeable future. The sobering news is that transforming\nthis recognition into concrete partnership \nwill remain difficult—no matter who holds power \non the two sides of the Atlantic. ■\nAn ebullient transatlantic reunion may be \n in store come January 2009. But then the \n hard realities of cooperation will set in.\n']</pre>
