The great\nthinkers, the great workers in any\ndirection, but a purely physical one,\nhave for the most part been abstemi\nous men. If not naturally of small ap\npetite they have exercised constant\nrestraint grudging from the play of\nhigher function every moment and\nevery energy spent upon the animal\nactivities of their nature. Habit soon\nhelps the fine effort of such people,\nand it becomes natural for them to\neat less, to drink less and to sleep\nlets than their fellows. Thus.

Such labors of the\nwill and of the brain demand at the\ntime the whole energies of a human\nbeing.
