His consti\ntuents "wijl serve their own and their\ncountry\'s best Interests by making\ntheir endorsement in November pro\nnounced. Nevada thus will range her\nself with those States, north, south\nand east, retaining in congressional\ncommission at this most important\ntime servants of demonstrated capac\nity.\nMr. Newlands was ten years a mem\nstands and sympathizes with all sec\ntions. In a sense, and the best sense,\nhe Is of all and with all. ?\nTo the railroad problem and to the\ntnist problem the Nevada senator has\ngiven much thought, and that thought\nis showing now in the legislation of\nthe day. He is reaping the reward of\na pioneer never discouraged by find\ning himself well in advance of the pro\ncession. He has counted -with confl\n* ? 1\nj decice on having his views accepted\nwhen properly understood, and his\nconfidence has been * justified. He\nstands as well approved by congres\nber of the House before his promot\nion came. He reached the Senate\nan experienced, and distinguished\nlegislator, and he has materially ad\nvanced his reputation. A thorough\nparty man in party matters, he is\nyet national in his views and lias been\nnational in his contributions to the\nsolution of broad public questions.\nBorn in the south, educated in the\neast, developed as a politlcan in the\nwest, Mr. Newlands may be described\nas a national product. He under\nsional action as any man in either\nparty now in office.\nBut our railroad problem and our\n! trust problem are not yet solved. Much\nremains to be done; and Mr. New\nlands, if re-electdd, will contribute to\nthat work as valuably as he has to\nthe work already accomplished. A\nrenewl of his senatorial commission\nwill strengthen him for a task the im\nportance of which could not be easily\noverestimated. ? From the Evening\nStar, Washington, D. C., Sept. 6, .1914.\nHON.

These\nturrets will be the best protection of\nany in the world and they will be the\nheaviest ever set up, weighing on the\naverage of about 80 tons, or some 11\ntons more than the turrets on the Ar\ngentine battleship Dtvadavla; which\nwas considered the "last word" in na\nval construction when she was laid\ndown.\nEach of the turrets of the Nevada\nwill have three 14-irich guns the most\npowerful of any United States battle\nships and rivaled only by a f^w gtins\nin the British and Qerman fleots.

The Bos\nton Braves made it three straights\nfrom the champion Athletics at the\nBoston grounds today and thereby\npractically cinched their claim on the\non the baseball championship of the\nworld. It was a great battle fought\nunder ideal conditions. The day op\nened up fair and warm with just\nenough sting to the atmosphere to put\nbig chunks of fight into the anatomy\nof both teams. And fight they did.\nThe game was anybody\'s from the\ntime play ball was called until the\nthird man was out in the twelfth in\ning. Twelve innings, Boston 5, Ath\nletics 4. A sad tale for the grizzled\nveterans of the Old guard of the Ath\nletics and a joyful one foe the coming\nBraves. Joyful, because it means\nthat the victorious Braves are within\none game of the honor which is the\ngoal toward which each team in the\nmajor leagues is looking and hoping\nsomeday to reach. The Athletics are j\non the run; their defeat has turned\ninto a complete route and it is doubt\nful if the series lasts any longer than\nI\ntomorrow when the fourth game of\nthe series will be played. And today\nthere is a new homerun wonder in the |\nbig leagues and his name is not Baker\nneither is he a member of the Ath- !\nletics. His name is Gowdy, big Gow\ndy of the Braves. For it was his cir\ncuit clout in the eleventh inning when\nthe score stood four to two against\nhis team, that started the rally which\nended in the dowfall of the Athletics.\nTo him all credit is due and he is to\nday the hero of the camp of Bean\nEaters.\nThe game started under the most\nauspicious circumstances that .could\nbe wished. The day was ideal and a\nhuge crowd had filled the huge grand- i\nstand and bleachers at the National 1\nLeague park. . The batteries were an\nnounced as Bush and Schang for the\nAthletics and Tyler and Gowdy for the\nBraves and the battle was on. And \'\nsuch a battle has not been seen in\'\nBoston in many years^ First one\nteam would have the advantage and J\nthen the other would tie it up. The\nPhillies scored one in the first inning\nand the Braves did the same trick in .\nLECTURE TONIGHT\nAT BAPTIST CHURCH\nI\nDr. Francis Espenosa, of Central I\nAmerica, will give as Illustrated lec\nture on the Evils of Spiritualism at\nthe Baptist church here, \'Tuesday eve\nning at 8 o\'clock.

Howorer,\nIt was not fault of the local committee\nwho had the arrangements in band for\n.preparations were made in good style\n1 by the local republicans but the crowd\nand enthusiasm failed to materialise.\nAt that, however, a fair crowd was In\nthe Opera House when It opened it\ndoors and some of them say that the\nmoving pictures were excellent.\nO? ?\nRex Change of Program\nHigh Class Vaudeville In addition to\nregular programme which Includes 6\nreels of high class pictures, including\nPathe Weekly.\ntheir half of the second. They each\nscored a run in the fourth and then,\nno more runs were scored until the\neleventh when came the time which\nhas made Gowdy the hero of all Bos\ntonese. The Athletics scored two\nruns in this inning by two hitB and a\nstolen base and the hearts of all Bos\nton went dead. It looked like their\nchances had gone glimmering just as\nthey had their best chance to win the\ngame. They came in for their turn\nat the bat, however with grim deter\nmination on their faces. Gowdy was\nthe first man up. He. let a good one\npass then two balls then drove the\npellet into the bleachers in deep right\nfor the circuit of the baseB. Then\nthings happened so suddenly that be\nfore the Athletics could recover and\nrebalance their broken defense, an\nother run had been pushed across the\nplate and the score was tied. Then it\nwas . the time of the Athletics to be\ndisheartened. They saw victory slip\nping from their grasp. And a victory\non which hung their chance for an\nother championship at their belts.\nWhen they came in from their field\nthey saw another pitcher facing them.\nAnd it was a pitcher who struck fear\ninto the hearts of all Mack\'s crew. It\nwas the redoubtable Bill James who\nhad Just held them to two measly hits\non Saturday. And he lived up to hlft\nreputation in that one inning of to\nday\'s game by setting the Mackmen\ndown one, two, three. Then the\nBraves made the rally that put them\none notch closer to the championship\nof the world. They came to the bat\nwith more confidence than they had\nshown throughout the entire game and\nproceeded to drive out the run which\ngave them the victory. And it was\na well-deserved one. They had come\nfrom behind in a heart rending finish\nwhen defeat stared them in the face\nand had won out in the face of seem\ningly overwhelming odds.\nThe score by innings was:.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 J\nathletics 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nBraves 0 10 10 0 0\n8 9 10 11 12 R.

It is a\ngrand amusement for a mighty race.\nO\nTHE DAY OF DIVERSIFIED\nFARMING\nThe time hats ariived all over the\nUnited States when a more diversified\nsystem of farming must - take the\nplace of the old rule of thumb meth\nods now employed. Instead of the\nlarge ranches, experts have demon\nstrates that the omre lucrative sys\ntem of working plans is to take smal\nler bodys of land and bring out all\nthere is in it to be found. In certain\nparts of the United States, and Ne\nvada is no exception JLo this rule, men\ncan be found owning vast ranches of\nland, and good land at that who &re\nveritably land-poor. They have\nenough land to make a dozen farms\nand because they are unable to prop\nerly cultivate the large area, they do\nnot get half the yield they should out\nof the land. The cry of modern farm\ning is for smaller farms and more\nconcentration. And Elko County is\nthe Ideal spot for this system of farm\ning. Almost any part of this county\nIs available for dry farming and with\na dry farm of say, 300 acres, more\nmoney can be made than can be off of\na large tract of land half tended. Mr.\nSohlnfan, of the^state dry farm in this\ncounty has stated that the ideal farm\nfor this section of the country is a 300\nacre farm and that the larger farms\nare not producing the amount of farm\nproducts they should. The time is\ncoming at the present rate of settle\nment which is going on in this state,\nwhen these largo ranches and farms,\nnow so common all over the state,\nmust be cut up into smaller places\nand a more concentrated system of\ntillage be employed. It is coming\napaoe and the time is not far remov\ned when this must happen. Tht great\ncry of the whole country is a more\nconcentrated systom of farming, It\nhas already pervaded the east and the\nsouth and slowly but surely the west\nIs coming to the point when it, too,\nmust adopt these more modern meth\n, ods.\nO -\nMm.

Mr. Brackett makes Quite- regular\ntrips to Gold Circle and had this to\nsay about that mining section:\n"The district 1b improving -through\nleasers\' development and company\noperations, like the Eastern Star,\nElko Prince and the new owners of\nthe Rex. . j\n"Grading is being done under the\nnew management for the - Eastern\nStar mill. The lumber for the struc\nture la being hauled now and machi\nnery has been ordered that is adapted\nto handle and reduce fifty tons of ore\nper day. The new management an\nnouces aggressive developmnet work\nduring construction of the mill and a\npersistent campaign to make the East\nern Star the premier mine ef the\nGold Circle district\n"The Savage interests announce\nthat they will build a mill for the\nElko Prince and continue develop\nment work in the deeper workings of\nthis property. The ore blocked out\nand capable of proof measurement ap\nproximates over $1,250,000. not tak\ning into consideration speculative ore\npractically in sight and which is es\ntimated at hundreds of thousands of\ndollars.\n"The production of the Rex mill on\nleasers\' ores taken from the Rex mine\nand ore overlooked by former owners\naverages better than 9500 a day in\nbullion.\n"A recent sensational development\nis on the Hardscrabble claim, owned\nby Brown and Rice. The property\nhas three sets of leasers working on\nthe well defined vein. The Brackett\nand Berlin lease has ore that runs as\nhigh as\'|8 a pound. The gold Is free\nand is of the beautiful crystalized\nsort. The George Worth block next\nto it has similar ore and is on the\nsame vein. The Brown-Agnew lease\nis breaking three feet of ore with oc\ncasional bunches of high grade in\nwhich three feet, eliminating the high\ngrade, runs better than $40 a ton.\n"The whole district has such a\nshowing as to make it a profitable\nconsideration for capital to pay some\nattention."\nu\nAnd now the railroads are going to\nraise freight rates "on account of the\nwar."

J. . Moyle was\n?held In Rochester Wednesday, all\n-day being consumed In examining\nthe sixteen witnesses and reaching\n?the decision that the prisoner was not\n? guilty:\nOn account of the evidence It was\nfound that the charge of manslaugh\nter could not be brought and that If\nbound over a plea of accidental dis\ncharge of the gun would result. No\nevidence of revenge was shown.\nIt was proved that Kavanaugh\n?had wrested the gun from the de\nceased with his left hand, the mid- :\nidle finger of which he had caught\n.under the hammer to - prevent dis\ncharge, and which was cut with the\nhammer in twisting the gun around.\nHe then had pointed his right hand\nat Moyle telling him to "beat it," in\nthe meantime trying to get his finger\nfree from the hammer of the gun in\nthe left hand. The gun went oil\nwhile doing this.\nIt was - proved conclusively that \'\nthe dead man had stated to several |\nthat he intended to kill Kavanaugh j\non sight. .\nAfter proper consideration of all\nthe evidence.
