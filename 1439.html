A., Juneau Alaska, Chicago, Milwaukee and bu raul Kailway, SOME QUEER LAWS, When New France, In This Coun, try, Was Ruled From Quebec., JUSTICE IN EARLY MICHIGAN., -j \'■, ! In the Pioneer Days of the Territory, as, It Was Than, tha Judges V/ere Not, Lawyers, and the Jurora Wera Evi, dently Pretty Independent., Before there was any "Michigan,", from 1622 to 1763, that part of our, country was a part of New Fraiice, and was governed from the seat of, government In Quebec. Our laws, came from the Fretach king and fr6m, the local council at Quebec, and many, of them were quite absurd., For Instance, while they did not at, tempt to rejmlate the length of sheets, on hotel beds, they did declare that, "besides white bread and light brown, bread all bakers shall make dark, brown bread whenever the same shall, be required." Another of the old, French laws, probably lobbied through, by some long dead cattle baron, was:, Whereas, The people of this province, raise too many horses, tvhlch prevent*, them from raisins cattle and sheep, being, Ignorant of their true Interests. Now,, therefore, we command that each Inhab, itant of this government shall hereafter, own no more than two horses or marea, and one foal, the same to take effect after, the sowing season of the ensuing year, tTIO, srtvlngr them time to rid themselves, of their horses In excess of said number,, after which they will be required to kill, any of such excess that may remain in, their possession., Another law was meant to stop the, congregation of the population In the, cities before It really began. It was a, law, To Promote Agriculture and Protect, Morals., We prohibit and forbid all farmers from, removing to this town, Quebec, under any, pretext whatever, wlthoat our permission, tn writing, on pain of being expelled and, sent back to their farms, furniture and, goods being confiscated and a fine of 60, francs for the benefit of hospitals. And,, furthermore, we forbid the Inhabitants of, this town, Quebec, letting houses or rooms, to persons coming In from the country on, pain of a fine of 100 francs^ also for hos, pitals., A law forbidding profanity provided, the punishment for the first offense to, be n pecuniary fine, for the second,, third and fourth repetition the fine was, to be doubled, tripled and quadrupled,, for the fifth offense "they shall set In, the pillory on Sunday and other festi, val days, there to remain from 8 in the, morning till 1 in the afternoon, exposed, to all sorts of approbrium and abuse.", The sixth punishment was that "they, be led to the pillory and have the upper, lip cut with a hot iron." For the sev, enth they were to have the lower lip, cut in the same manner. The law fur, ther provides:, And if by reason of obstinacy and in, veterate bad habit they continue after all, these punishments to utter oaths and blas, phemies It Is our will and command that, they have the tongue completely cut out, so that hereafter ihey cannot utter them, again., The Judiciary portion of Michigan, territory in the early days was com, posed of "county courts" and "Justices, of the peace." The "courts" consisted, of three Judges, none of whom were, lawyers. Their Jurisdiction, both civil, and criminal, was limited. It is need, less to say that the Justice courts were, conducted without much regard to cer, emony., In one suit brought to recover the, amount of a note of hand a Jury of six, was impaneled, the foreman of which, was a large and portly individual who, bore the title of colonel. Probably on, account of his assumed military rank, he was permitted to wear his hat dur, ing the entire trial, One of the witnesses made repeated, statements that were Irrelevant and, contradictory, and one of the counsel, as often rose and took exception, but, each time he was overruled by the Jus, tice. At each objection the colonel, manifested a great deal of annoyance, by fidgeting in his seat and talking In, loud whispers to his fellow Jurors., Finally the witness made a state, , ment that was so opposed to every rule, or evidence una cuuuuiuu srcuov uiai iuc, attorney who had so often attempted, to exclude this sort of evidence could, no longer silently submit He again, rose from his seat and respectfully, appealed to the court, protesting, against such statements going to the, Jury as testimony., Thereupon the worthy colonel im, pressively rose from his seat and swore, hp would no longer sit there and hear, that "lawyer feller make a fuss." Hte, said he had taken the oath as a Juror, to decide the ease according to the evi, dence, and If he could not bear the, whole story from the witness he should, leave the courtroom., He accordingly made several strides, toward the door when the Justice arose, and. approaching the Irate Juror,, placed a band on his shoulder and, begged him to return to his seat with, the Jury, promising that the trouble, some attorney should not again be al, lowed to Interfere with the evidence., After some persuasion the colonel, consented to return Pressing his hat, more firmly on his head, be exclaimed, as he took his seat:, "Well, I\'ll try It once more, but, danged If I will stand any more of that, lawyer feller\'s nonsense." The attor, ney gave up in despair, and the oppos, ing counsel had things all his own way, after that.—Detroit Saturday Night, Love., Love Is the thread on which are, strung the beads of trust.

The, doctrine has been often questioned by, European powers, but only once has a, serious attempt been made to violate, it. This was between 1861 and 1SC5,, when the United States was engaged, in Interneeinb warfare that imperiled, its very existence. Just as soon as our, war broke out the warships of Eng, land, France and Spain set sail for, Mexico and took possession of Vera, Cruis. Secretary Seward notified the, three allied powers of our deep concern, and anxiety for the security and wel, fare of the Mexican republic and that, our fleet would be stationed in the ghlf, of Mexico to look after our interests., England and Spain soon withdrew,, but It became evident that Napoleon, III. Intended to overthrow the republic, of Mexico as he had the republic of, France. A fictitious empire was forced, upon Mexico by Trench troops, and an, Austrian archduke; Maximilian, was, selected as the puppet sovereign. The, French invasion was directed against, all the republics of the new world. It, was prophesied in Paris that in ten, years every South American- republic, would be converted into a monarchy, and the United States into a dictator, ship., The hands 01 the American govern, ment were tied, but the voice of the, American people could not be silenced., In the midst of 6ur own war, when, war with England seemed imminent,, the house of representatives risked a, war with Frante by passing a vote of, 109 to nothing that "It does hot accord, with the policy 6t the United States, to acknowledge any monarchical gov, ernment erected upon the ruins of any, republican government in America un, der the tfuspices of any European, power.", Nothing more could be done at the, time, but\' Just as soon as our war was, over Geherfil Grant proposed to organ, ize an army of combined Union and, Confederate soldiers who would volun, teer to march to the City of Mexico, and expel the Austrian emperor. He, selected General Schofleld to enlist, troops for service on the republican, side of Mexico. The war department, gave General Schofleld a leave of ab, sence for a year, with permislon to go, beyond the limits of the United States, and to take with him any of his staff, officers that he wanted. In the mean, time Grant sent Sheridan to the Rio, uranae witn ou.uw Troops, wmcn were, distributed along the frontier, where, they threatened the French lines, i, But fortunately force was not neces, sary. The show of force was sufficient, and Schofleld was sent to Paris to ne, gotiate for the retirement of the, French troops instead of into Mexico, to drive them out. The secretary of, state notified Napoleon in November,, 1805, that fhe United States "still re, garded the effort to establish perma, nently a foreign and imperial govern, ment in Mexico as disallowable and, impracticable." As the emperor of the, French did not seem disposed to pay, any attention to this Mr. Seward set, a definite date for the withdrawal of, the French troops.\', The Mexican republicans under Jua, rez had been keeping up a brave fight, for freedom, although Maximilian had, ordered all of them shot whenever, caught, without trial or the possibility, of pardon. As soon as the United, States had compelled the withdrawal, of the French the republicans were, able to overcome the imperialists with, no official assistance from the United, States. Their victory was marred by, tlie unnecessary execution of the would, be emperor In spite of the interposition, of Secretary Seward., But the United States had to sty, "Hands off!" to Austria as well as to, France. Bather than have an Austrian, archduke Ignomlniously dismounted, from the throne it was planned to ship, 10,000 Austrian troops from Trieste to, Vera Cruz. But our minister at Vien, na, Mr. Motley, was told by Secretary, Seward that If Austria allowed a sin, gle soldier to embark for Mexico the, United States would break off rela, tions at once. The Austrian govern, ment saw the point and prohibited the, shipment of the troops enlisted for, Mexico.—New York Independent., t k What T| !• THat Win«., A countrywoman remarked to her, neighbor ■ during a conversation on, their return from market, "How is it,, Mary, that you have been married four, times and I\'ve never been married at, all and I\'m much handsomer than, you?", "Aye, to be sure," returned Mary,, "but\' it ain\'t handsomeness that does, it, Sarah.
