The\nstrike of the veins to the eastward\nindicates that the Independent shaft\nwill go down almost on top of the\nveins, providing they continue un\nchanged in their course. . Moreover,\nif file dip to northward correlates\nwith the veins of the ore zone fur\nther west, these veins will probably\nbe encountered nearer the surface\nin the Independent than in the old\nshaft of the East End. with less\nwtaer to pump, if any. Both shafts\nare about the same depth.\nThe consolidation of these two\npioperties puts the united acreage\nof virgin ground In a most advan\ntageous position, and will prove in\nteresting to capital for extensive le\nvelopment.

This company has the\nvery strongest kind of backing, and\nluring the panic of 1907 when many\nother companies were closed down,\nit continued its development. Dur\ning the war the property suspended\nand it was not until last fall that the\ncompany began to prepare for re\nopening. During the cold weather\nthe management thought it best to\nallow the property to remain idle,\nowing to the fact that the Buckeye\nshaft is downcast, and bulkheading\n:he shaft for any repair work would\nwork a hardship upon some of the\nneighboring mines which would be\ndeprived of the air current for ven\ntilation.\nSeveral attempts have been made\nto obtain leases upon the Buckeye,\nbut two of them balked at the clause\nof "no ore can be taken out by\nundermining from adjoining prop\nerties." The Buckeye has cut ore in sev\neral places and since 1914 has been\nin the ore formations. Assays have\nshown values from $18 to $3S5, but\nno publicity has ever been given to\nthis, and it has never been the policy\nif the company to make a market\nfor its shares.\nThe following was published in the\nBonanza, on December 1st. , 1914,\n.vhich shows that ore-bearing forma\ntions were known to the Buckeye\nmanagement long before the present\ndevelopment in adjoining mines dis\nposed that fact:\n"A discovery of the utmost import\nance to the future development of\nTonopah has been made in the east\nern territory by which the mineral\nized zone has been extended in\ndefinitely eastward.

Viviani to try to\nwhip the League of Nations into life.\nThe league is as dead as Julius\nCaesar, and it never had a particle\nof Caesar\'s glory. It was, to use\nequine phraseology, a horse not\nworth backing in the race for pesce.\nAmerica, remarkable for its "horse\nsenbe," took care not to back the\nleague to win.\nM. Viviani fears that Premier L\'oyd\nGeorge wants to kill the league.\nThere is no need of administering\nthe "coup de grace" to the defunct\nIr the tale which delighted our child\nhood Jack killed Giant Blunderbore,\nbut if Blunderbore had already been\na corpse, neither a Jack nor a\nGeorge would have been required to\nkill him. The league was a Latin\nleague, and the Latin race cannot\nrule the world. The great war\nshowed the vileness and. worthless\nness of racial animosities. France\nand Germany should not hate each\nother. Such hatreds are suicidal.\nThe true interests of humanity are\none. and no world-problem can be\nsolved until all nations are united.\nIt is not true that the league\nsolved the problem of Upper Bilesia.\nIt has solved no problem, it has\nnot extinguished bolshevism. It has\nleft Europe to face a dark and peril\nous future.\nThe Washington conference has\nbeen as great a success as the league\nof nations has been a failure. There\nis no use lashing a dead horse. The\nwretched league belongs to the abor\ntions of history. Nothing can be\ndone with It. The only thing to do\nIs to bury it. The man who strove\nso tenaciously to make It the win\nning horse so that he might carry off\nthe world\'s peace prize has disap\npeared from the political arena, and\nis now only a hopeless rallying-polnt\nfor a few crazy partisans. Neither\nhe nor any other man on earth can\ngalvanize the league back to life.\nIt is just aa much a phantom as the\nholy alliance. All we can say of It\nis In the words of Hamlet: "Alas!\npoor\nHORNlvER IS\nBOOMING. SAYS\nTHIS BOOSTER\n"Hornsllver Is showing prosperity,"\nremarked T. C.

Aaaorlated Trews)\nSAN FRANCISCO, Mar. 22 Names\not numerous candidates are being\nsuggested in various states to rep\nresent each state officially as Its\n"greatest hero" at the proposed liv\ning hall of fame of World War\nheroes to be one of the features of\nthe second annual national conven\ntion of the Dlsbled Veterans of the\nWorld War, here June 26-30.\nRICH MINERAL\nThe stope above the intermediate\nlevel of the Silver Pick lease on the\nRed Top mine of the Consolidated is\nnow 40 feet long, 20 feet wide and\n50 foet high. A crosscut at the top\nof the stope shows the ore to be 20\nfeet wide. Drillings from a 6-foot\nhole driven near (lie top of the stope\nat a point where the stope is 7\'\nfeet wide assayed $15. The eighth\nand ninth carloads of ore, about $50\nmaterial, will be shipped from the\nlease tomorrow. The top and north\nside of the stope are in ore of an\naverage value of not less than $40\nto $50.\nThese facts constitute the most\nimportant condition in mining in\n(ioldfield since the discovery of the\ngreat orebody n the Jumbo Exten\nsion, and experts on Gold field ore,\niren who have been connected with\n(lie mining companies of Liie district\nfor many years, declare there is\n-trong possibility that the Silver Pick\nhas in the Red Top an orebidy that\nwill equal or surpass that of the\nJumbo Extension, says the Tribune.\nNowhere does (lie discovery of an\norebody such as the Silver Pick now\nhas mean as much as in Goldfield.\nThe ore that is being shipped from\nthe mine has a gross value of $3000\na carload and the net profit to the\nSilver Pick, exclusive of royalty, is\nabout $2000 a carload.\nRemarkable as it is at this stage\nin the life of Goldfield. the ore\nshipped and exposed in the stope is\nreally of minor importance. The j\nfeature of the conditions In the\nlease is the position of the oreshoot\nwith relation to the bonanza stopes\nof the Red Top thai mark the places\nfrom which came the heaviest pro\nduction of the Consolidated. Into\nthe foot-wall, 200 feet from these\nstopes, the Silver Pick now has ore.\nOresboots in the Goldfield district\nare found in parallel veins. The\nmost recent illustration of this was\nthe Florence Divide lease on the\nFlorence, where an orebody of re\nmaikable richness was found In a\nvein wall. Now, in the Red Top,\nthe Silver Pick has this condition\nan oreshoot in a vein parallel to\nthat from which a large proportion\nof the production of the Consolidated\ncame. The possibilities are consid\nered to be boundless.\nHOG IS COMING\nINTO OWN WITH\nBIG MONUMENT\nII\n111\nJUSTICE IS METED\nTO BOOK BORROWER\nMly AftHot\'inlril I\'rel\nGENEVA, Mar. 22.- Justice has at\nlast overtaken the man who borrows\nbooks and "forgets" to return trem.\nA book-borrower of Babikon, a suburb\nof Zurich, has been sentonrod to two\ndays\' imprisonment and a fine of\n4o francs p\'.us the value of the book\nhe failed to return.\nThe Magistrate in passing sentence\n(By AnnH\'lHtd I\'rci)\nBLUE BALL, O , Mar. 22 A mon\nument is to be erected here to com\nmemorate the beginning of the prac\ntice of writing pedigrees for hogs.\nThe first such pedigrees, oldest rec\nords show, were written in 1875 for\nfoland China hogs on the farm\nowned here by W.

This crosscut\nshould soon enter the vein and sur\nface indications above and to the\nwest of this point of intersection are\nexceedingly promising," according to\nthe report, says the Tribune.\nIt was from the surface of the\nvein toward which . tho crosscut is\nbeing driven that early-day leasees\ntook much good ore. A drift from\nthe main crosscut on the 236-foot\nlevel entered ore assaying $45 to\n$60 for 1 to 114-foot widths. This\nshoot was small, but it was of great\nimportance in that it proved the\nvein to be ore-bearing.
