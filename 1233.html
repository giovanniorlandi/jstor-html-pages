H. PIERRE 2 \nFOUR years ago in this same room we listened to an able presen-tation of the need of using more phosphate fertilizers as a means \nof greatly increasing our food production during the world crisis (36). 3 \nSince that time we have increased our annual consumption of phosphate\nfertilizers by over 30%. Yet the role of phosphorus in the \nnational and world problem of food production and adequate nutrition\nhas not been diminished. Phosphorus is so basic to the whole \nproblem of crop production that probably no other subject in the \nfield of soil fertility has received more attention through the years \nthan the phosphorus problem in its various soil-plant and soil-animal \nrelationships. And it probably will continue to challenge the best \nefforts of investigators for many years. \nI have chosen as the subject of my talk this evening, "The Phosphorus\nCycle and Soil Fertility". It is an ambitious subject-one that \nif treated fully would fill a good-sized book-for all phases of the soil \nphosphorus problem are related directly or indirectly to the phosphorus\ncycle. I can assure you immediately, however, that it is not \nmy intention to cover this subject in all its implications. This subject \nis one in which I have long been interested; I chose this title because \nit emphasizes a viewpoint that is sometimes missed in the consideration\nof soil problems. The term "cycle" implies that we are dealing \nwith a dynamic system-a system where soil, plant, and microorganism\nall play important roles. Moreover, it implies an over-all \nrather than a key-hole view of the problem. As a field of inquiry \ndevelops, it is necessary to specialize on narrow phases of a problem. \nBut in so doing, we sometimes neglect the broader relationships, a full \nunderstanding of which is<so\' often necessary for a solution of\'the \nimmediate problem. While this may ~1ot be any more true of phosphorus\nthan of many other agronomic problem, I believe you will agree \nthat there are serious gaps in our knowledge, which become evident \nas we examine the phosphorus cycle. · ·1Presidential\naddress presented at the annual meetihg of the Society, Cincin-\nnati, Ohio, November 19, 1947.

More accurately, however,\nwe are concerned (a) with all the chemical and biological changes \nthat are continually taking place in the various phosphorus compounds\nof the soil, (b) with the transformations that occur as phos-\nphorus is absorbed and utilized by plants and by soil microorganisms, \nand (c) with the reconversion of the organic phosphorus of plant and \nmicrobial residues to simpler forms through microbial processes or \nenzyme action. \nIn many respects, the phosphorus cycle may be likened to the \nnitrogen cycle. Phosphorus like nitrogen is found in organic and inorganic\nforms in soils and in plants. The mineralization of both or-\nganic phosphorus and nitrogen compounds contributes to the nutrient \nsupply of plants. In the nitrogen cycle the auxiliary source of supply \nis the nitrogen of the air, brought into the cycle by the processes of \nsymbiotic and nonsymbiotic nitrogen fixation. In the phosphorus \ncycle, the auxiliary supply comes from the store of unweathered phosphorus\nminerals of both surface and subsoil, brought into the bio-\nlogical part of the cycle through absorption by plant roots and soil \nmicroorganisms. Even this supply of phosphate minerals is not \nstatic in terms of the long-time cycle of erosion and deposition. \nNext to nitrogen, phosphorus is the most abundant nutrient element\ncontained in microorganisms, making up as much as two per \ncent of their dry weight. Largely for that reason, phosphorus is, \nnext to nitrogen, the most important nutrient element in soil organic \nmatter. And phosphorus availability like nitrogen availability is \nclosely linked to the activity of soil microorganisms: \nCLASSES OF PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS IN SOILS \nThe phosphorus compounds of soils can be grouped into three \ngeneral classes: (a) The inorganic compounds in which the phosphorus\nis combined largely with calcium, magnesium, iron and alu-\nminum and with clay minerals, (b) the organic compounds present \nin plant and animal residues and products of microbial synthesis, and \n(c) the organic and inorganic phosphorus compounds in the cells of \nliving matter, which in a sense serve as the connecting link between \nthe other two general classes of compounds. . \nINORGANIC PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS \nOf these three classes, the inorganic phosphate compounds have \nreceived by far the largest amount of attention. In many soils, particularly\nin the lower horizons, a portion of the phosphorus still exists \nas fluorapatite, the mineral from which practically all the phosphorus \nin soils was derived. This mineral is very resistant to weathering and \n', 'PIERRE: THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE AND SOIL FERTILITY 3 \nhas been petrographically identified in the silt and sand fractions \nof many soils, including some that are highly weathered (r6). In the \nprocesses of weathering and soil development part of the phosphorus, \nreleased from apatite, forms secondary compounds of varying solubility;\nsome is absorbed by plants and microorganisms to be convert-\ned to organic combinations and later, in part, returned to the soil in \nthe accumulating organic matter. \nAlthough most of the soil inorganic phosphorus compounds cannot\nbe isolated and positively identified, considerable indirect evi-\ndence is available as to the type of compounds present (14, 32). The \ncalcium phosphates constitute a series, ranging from the relatively \nsoluble mono and di-calcium phosphates, which are present only in \nsmall amounts, to relatively insoluble hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite.\nThe iron and aluminum phosphates may also vary widely in \nsolubility depending on the amounts of phosphorus present in the \ncompounds. In soils, however, they probably exist largely as basic \ncompounds such as in the minerals dufrenite and wavellite, which are \nvery insoluble except under neutral or alkaline conditions. There is \nalso evidence that some inorganic phosphorus in soils may be combined\nwith clay minerals (II, r 7). Any clay-lattice phosphorus pre-\nsent would be only slightly available to plants, whereas that which \nmay exist in hydroxyl positions (7, 34) or as "cation-exchange phosphate"\n(2) on the surface of clay minerals would have a fairly high \navailability. \nIn general, solubility studies have shown that the inorganic phosphates\nof iron and aluminum tend to accumulate in acid soils whereas \ncalcium phosphates are predominant in neutral or alkaline soils (II, \n32). A pH of about 6.5 to 7.0 is desirable from the standpoint of \nphosphorus availability because this range is above the pH of minimum\nsolubility of iron and aluminum phosphates and below the pH \nof minimum solubility of calcium phosphates (14, 32). Any change in \nthe pH of soils, either by liming or the use of acid-forming materials \nwill, therefore, affect the inorganic phase of the phosphorus cycle by \ntending to convert one form of phosphorus to another and thereby \naltering plant availability. But factors besides soil reaction may \naffect the availability of inorganic phosphates. What is the effect of \nmagnesium, silica and other soil constitutents? Why, for example, is \nthere so much difference in the availability of phosphorus in different \ntypes of calcareous soils? Before much further progress can be made \non such problems, we will need more quantitative information on the \nspecific compounds in different soils and a better understanding of \ntheir relation to the rest of the phosphorus cycle. \nORGANIC PHOSPHORUS CONTENT OF SOILS \nIt is the organic phosphorus of soils, plants, and microorganisms, \nthat is of particular interest in the dynamic biological phases of the \ncycle. Compounds of organic phosphorus are more complex than the \ninorganic compounds, and they have received much less study. Some \nrecent investigations, however, particularly those that have been \ncarried on at MacDonald College, Quebec (12, 13, 36, 38, 39) and in \n', '4 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nour laboratories at Ames (5, 6, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 35) have given \nemphasis to this phase of the phosphorus cycle. · \nData based on improved methods of extraction show that the \norganic phosphorus in the surface layers of many soils constitutes \nat least one-third, and in some cases, such as in Prairie soils, as much \nas two-thirds of the total phosphorus (2o, 22). The amount decreases \nwith depth in the profile as would be expected from the decrease in \norganic matter. A limited amount of data indicates that the N :P \nratio of soil organic matter is about ro :r in the surface layers of \nmineral soils, and usually somewhat higher in the lower horizons. \nThese variations are undoubtedly of some significance, but present \ninformation is too limited to provide a satisfactory explanation. \nIt is of interest to note that the N :P ratio in the organic matter is \nnot very far different on the average from the N :P ratio in plants \nand microorganisms. This and other evidence referred to later indicate\nthat the organic phosphorus of plant residues and soil organic \nmatter may be as rapidly mineralized as is the organic nitrogen. \nNATURE OF ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS IN SOILS, \nPLANTS, AND MICROORGANISMS \nUntil recently, our knowledge of the type of organic phosphorus \ncompounds found in soils was based exclusively on two indirect lines \nof evidence, (a) the types of phosphorus compounds found in plants \nand microorganisms, and (b) the decomposition products isolated \nfrom soils-products which might be expected to be formed from the \ntype of compounds returned to soils in plant residues. \nIt is established that three general types of compounds make up the \nbulk of the organic phosphorus in plants. These are phytin, phospholipids,\nand nucleic acids. Of these, the latter is found in largest \nquantities. Nucleic acid, combined with protein to form nucleoprotein,\nis also the dominant type of organic phosphorus compound \nin microorganisms. Phytin, the calcium-magnesium salt of inositol \nhexaphosphoric acid, is found principally in seeds where it makes up \nas much as 7 5 per cent of the phosphorus present. In other parts of the \nplant phytin apparently occurs only in small amounts, although the \ndata reported are inadequate and conflicting. Phospholipids, such as \nlecithin, are essential constituents of cells, but in general make up \nonly a small part of the total organic phosphorus content of plants, \nprobably averaging less than five per cent. Soil studies indicate that \nphospholipid phosphorus is present in soils in trace amounts only (r2). \nChemical studies have long ago established the fact that the organic\ndecomposition products of nucleic acids-the nitrogen-bases \nand carbohydrates-do exist in soils, or at least can be obtained upon \nacid hydrolysis of soil extracts containing organic phosphorus (3 r). \nMoreover, inositol, the organic part of the phytin molecule, has also \nbeen isolated from soils upon acid hydrolysis of organic phosphorus \npreparations (4o). Because of inadequate methods, however, no \nindication was thus obtained of the amounts of organic phosphorus \ncompounds present. Thus, for many years the evidence for the existence\nof phytin and of nucleic acid types of compounds in soils was \n', 'PIERRE: THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE AND SOIL FERTILITY 5 \nentirely circumstantial, and no quantitative data were available .. \nRecently, however, Bower (5) definitely established the presence of \nphytin and phytin derivatives in soils representative of the Prairie, \nWiesenboden, and Gray-Brown Podzolic great soil groups. He \nshowed that the inositol-phosphorus ratios of the compounds isolated\ncorresponded nearly exactly to those in phytin and inositol \ntriphosphate. Moreover, he developed a method for separating the \nphytin from the nucleic acid fraction of soil organic phosphorus and \nfor determining the amounts present. In three soils studied, he found \nthat 40 to 49% of the total organic phosphorus was present as phytin \nand phytin derivatives. The latter constituted about one-fourth of \nthe phytin fraction. Further evidence as to the nature of the soil \norganic phosphorus fractions separated was provided by dephosphorylation\ntests wi~h sodium hypobromite and various enzymes, \nwhich showed that the fractions behaved like phytin and nucleic \nacid, respectively (6). \nTHE AVAILABILITY OF ORGANIC PHOSPHATES TO PLANTS \nThe major question is, "Is this large reserve of phosphorus present \nas phytin and nucleic acid types of compounds involved actively in \nthe phosphorus cycle? Is it much of a factor in determining the phosphorus\nrequirement of soils? Or is it largely a "frozen asset", like the \nphosphorus in apatite, that is important only in the long-time consideration\nof soil fertility but is too slowly available to be an impor-\ntant factor in meeting the immediate or even year by year needs of \nthe crop. \nThe fact of nitrogen mineralization and of correlated changes in \ntotal nitrogen, total carbon and total organic phosphorus in soils \n(22) furnishes strong circumstantial evidence as to the active part \n"played by soil organic phosphorus in the phosphorus cycle. On the \nother hand, the fact that many soils high in organic phosphorus are \ndeficient in available phosphorus has been responsible for the suggestions\nthat organic phosphorus may not be important in plant \nnutrition. Experiments with pure organic phosphorus compounds in \nculture solutions have shown, however, that phytin and lecithin are \ndirectly absorbed by plants and that nucleic acid is so readily mineralized\nby enzymes on plant roots that it was not possible to determine \nwhether the phosphorus was being absorbed in the organic or inorganic\nform (27). What then is the explanation forthe fact that soils \nhigh in total organic phosphorus or in phytin and nucleic acid forms \nmay be low in available phosphorus? The obvious assumption would \nbe that the phytin and nucleic acid are made insoluble by reaction \nwith other soil components; and that dephosphorylation, in the case \nof the nucleic acid fraction, does not take place as readily in soils as in \npure solutions. Both of these assumptions have been shown to be true. \nIn the case of phytin the available evidence indicates that its reactions\nin soils are analogous to the reactions of inorganic phosphates. \nJust as phosphoric acid forms calcium or ferric salts, depending on the \nacidity of the solution and the presence of calcium and iron, so does \nphytic acid react in the formation of calcium and ferric phytates (r, \n', "6 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \n38). In acid soils, therefore, we can expect phytin to be present in \nrelatively insoluble iron as well as aluminum phytates. And in fact \nphytin does become relatively insoluble and unavailable to plants \nwhen added to acid soils. Bowe'r (6) found a very high correlation \nbetween the recovery of added phytin by oats and the percentage base \nsaturation of the soils, the coefficient of correlation being + o.95. In \nacid soils phosphorus recovery was very low whereas in an alkaline \nsoil of pH 7·4 the recovery was substantial, amounting to about onethird\nas much as with monocalcium phosphate. Moreover, the \namounts of phytin fixed by the soils, as measured by solubility in \nweak acid, showed an inverse relationship with the recovery of phos~ \nphorus by oats (r= -0.92). Monocalcium phosphate was fixed to a \nmuch less extent and was more available to plants. Thus, the accumulation\nof phytin in soils is not the result directly of a low rate of \nmineralization, but primarily because of its low solubility. Like inorganic\nphosphate its solubility is especially low in acid soils be-\ncause of the formation of insoluble salts of iron and aluminum, these \nsalts being even Jess soluble than the inorganic phosphates of iron \nand aluminum. \nWith respect to nucleic acid, the gaps in our knowledge are even \ngreater. The accumulation of the nucleic acid type of compounds in \nsoils is not readily reconciled with their rapid dephosphorylation by \nenzymes in culture solutions. Moreover, several investigators have \nfound that free nucleic acids undergo rather rapid although not complete\nminetalization when added to soils. In some experiments the \nphosphorus added as nucleic acids is found to be nearly as readily \navailable to plants as that added in the form of soluble inorganic \nphosphates (4, 19). It is evident, therefore, that most of the nucleic \nacids in soils do not exist in a simple form. Either they are physically \ninaccessible because of their being imbedded in slowly decomposable \nmaterials or they are there in compounds that are not readily attached· \nby enzymes and mineralized. In either case it is apparent that they \nare split off in the process of extraction of soils with solutions of sodium\nor ammonium hydroxides for it has been shown that organic \nphosphorus in alkali extract of soils is easily dephosphorylated by \nnuclease enzymes (6, 26). . \nWhat then are the probable compounds or forms in which nucleic \nacid is combined in soils and stabilized against dephosphorylation? \nRecent data by Bower (6) provide at least a partial explanation. He \nstudied not only the adsorption of three types of nucleic acid materials\nby clay minerals commonly found in soils but also the effect of \nsuch adsorption on the subsequent rate of dephosphorylation. Since \nseveral investigators had found that mineralization of nucleic acid \nwas lower in strongly acid, than in less acid soils, he conducted his \nadsorption studies in the pH range of 2 to 7. In brief, he found that \nguanine nucleotide and nucleic acid were rapidly adsorbed by clays, \nespecially by montmorillonite, and that this adsorption caused a \nmarked reduction in the rate of mineralization or enzyme hydrolysis. \nThe more acid the clay the greater was the adsorption and the lower \nthe release of inorganic phosphate. During a four-day period of reaction\nmontmorillonite caused a reduction in the amount of nucleic \n", 'PIERRE: THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE AND SOIL FERTILITY 7 \nacid mineralized from 91 to 16 per cent. Of even greater significance \nwas the fact that nucleo protein was completely adsorbed by the \nmontmorillonite clay at all pH values studied and that its dephosphorylation\nby bran enzymes in a four day period was reduced to \nonly three per cent. \nSince nucleic acids are largely present in plant and animal cells \ncombined with proteins as nucleo-proteins it is evident that their \nabsorption by clays-as plant and microbial residues are returned to \nsoils-may in part explain the accumulation of nucleic acid types of \nphosphorus compound in soils. It must also be kept in mind that \nrelatively small additions of nucleoproteins are returned to soils at \nany one time under natural conditions and that this would make \npossible more complete adsorption by clays and even greater stabilization\nthan was found in these laboratory experiments. Reactions \nbetween nucleic acids and other soil constituents may also be responsible\nfor the accumulation of the nucleic acid type of phosphorus \ncompounds in soils. \nThe fact then that phytin and nucleic acid phosphorus accumulate \nin soils during processes of soil formation and are continually being \nreturned to soils in dead microbial cells and plant and animal residues, \nand stabilized against rapid mineralization does not mean, however, \nthat these organic phosphates are relatively unimportant in plant \nnutrition. In fact, there is increasing evidence that the place of soil \norganic phosphates in the phosphorus cycle has not been fully appreciated.\nVariations in the rate of mineralization of the organic phos-\nphorus of soils are undoubtedly an important factor in explaining the \ndifferential response of crops to phosphorus fertilization and the \ndiscrepancies often encountered in relating the results of soil tests to \nsuch responses. Most chemical tests for estimating the readily available\nphosphorus in soils measure only soluble inorganic phosphorus. \nThis may explain why soils high in organic matter often give very \nlow tests for "readily available" phosphorus and yet show little \nresponse to phosphate fertilization. \nMINERALIZATION OF ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS \nThe fact that the organic phosphorus of soils decreases upon cropping\nwas shown. by Schollenberger (3o) over 25 years ago. Cultivated \nsoils were found to have lost about the same amounts of organic as of \ninorganic phosphorus since they had been brought under cultivation. \nMore recently, Pearson found in a study of eight cropped and comparable\nvirgin soils in Iowa ( 6), that cropping had on the average \nreduced the inorganic phosphorus content of soils by 55 ppm, but \nthe organic phosphorus by 83 ppm. In view, especially, of the continual\nadditions of organic phosphorus in crop, animal and microbial \nresidues these data are quite significant in showing that organic \nphosphates are not "frozen assets". \nShort-time studies of the transformations in soils are of even greater \nvalue, however, in determining the role of organic phosphorus in the \nphosphorus cycle and in plant nutrition. Using the same eight pairs of \nvirgin and cropped Iowa soils used by Pearson and referred to above, \n', "8 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nBower (6) found that during a month's incubation at 35°C the virgin \nsoils released an average of 39 ppm of phosphorus from the organic \nform while under the same conditions the cropped soils released from \nr to I8 or an average of I I ppm. Similar results have been obtained by \nThompson (35). Since crops usually require less than 20 pounds of \nphosphorus per acre, it is evident that the organic phosphorus compounds\nof many soils may make a significant contribution to the \nphosphorus absorbed by crops, especially from Prairie soils that contain\nat least a third of their total phosphorus in organic forms. \nFrom the standpoint of soil management practices it would, of \ncourse, be of considerable practical importance to know from what \ntype of compounds the organic phosphorus is being released over \nshort periods of time. Does it come from a large supply of relatively \nresistant materials or end products that are only slowly being decomposed\nby the action of soil microorganisms, or does it come from a \nmuch more limited supply consisting of compounds from more \nrecent plant and microbial residues? Our present knowledge of this \npoint hardly justifies a conjecture. Of interest in this connection, \nhowever, are some recent studies by Thompson (35) in which he \nobtained a close relationship between the amounts of nitrogen and of \nphosphorus mineralized in soils during one month's incubation at \n35°C, the correlation coefficient found being o.gr. This may indicate \nthat the nucleic acid type of compounds present in dead microbial \ncells and plant residues of recent origin are of primary importance. \nThe information available regarding the changes in the phosphorus \ncompounds of crop residues as the residues decompose in soils is also \nvery limited. Studies of decomposing plant materials outside of soils \nshow, however, that during the early stages of decomposition the \namount of organic phosphorus may actually increase at the expense \nof the inorganic fraction.· Then as the energy supply and the number \nof microorganisms in the decomposing residue decreases, the inorganic\nphosphorus is gradually released (8). \nTHE ROLE OF SOIL MICROORGANISMS \nThese considerations bring us to the role of microorganisms in the \nphosphorus cycle. Much of the interest and work in this field has \nbeen concerned with the effect of microorganisms in the liberation of \nphosphorus from insoluble mineral phosphates. It is recognized that \nthe la_rge amount of carbon dioxide liberated by soil microorganisms \nmay have a marked effect in increasing the availability of basic calcium\nphosphates, especially in neutral or alkaline soils, (r8). Under \ncertain conditions the solubility of mineral phosphates may also be \nslightly increased in the nitrification and sulfofication processes. In \ngeneral, however, it would seem that the two most important specific \nroles of microorganisms in the phosphorus cycle are (a) the production\nof enzymes, such as nucleases, which are necessary for the miner-\nalization or dephosphorylation of organic phosphorus and (b) the \nimmobilization of available inorganic and organic phosphorus compounds\npresent in soils. In general, investigators have been much more \nconcerned with the first of these effects, the liberation of phosphorus, \n", 'PIERRE: THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE AND SOIL FERTILITY 9 \nthan with the opposite, the immobilization or biological fixation of \nphosphorus by the soil microorganisms. \nLittle information is available as to how soils may differ in their \ncontent of dephosphorylating enzymes, but recent studies by Rogers \n(26) on sterilized soils indicate that nuclease enzymes are probably \ngenerally present in soils. \nThe amount of phosphorus immobilized in the bodies of soil microorganisms\nat any· one time may be considerable, especially when \nlarge supplies of available energy materials in the form of manures \nand plant residues are added to soils (33). Just as materials of wide \nC/N ratio will result in competition between the microorganisms and \nthe higher plants for the available nitrogen present, so also may there \nbe a competition for the available phosphorus when plant or animal \nresidues low in phosphorus and high in energy materials and nitrogen\nare added to soils. The addition of dried blood to a soil low in \navailable phosphorus, for example, was found by Chouchak (ro) to \ncause such an intensive development of soil microorganisms and such \na marked immobilization of the phosphorus that yields of millet \nwere materially decreased except where phosphate fertilizers were \nalso added. Where chloroform had been added to inhibit microbial \ndevelopment the inorganic phosphorus was actually increased. This \ninvestigator also obtained very striking results with a soil that had \nbeen sterilized and reinoculated (9). The large release of nitrogen and \nenergy material resulting from sterilization caused such a large immobilization\nof available phosphorus by the intensive development \nof microorganisms that the yield of millet where no phosphorus had \nbeen added was reduced from 2 7 to r gram per pot, whereas with \nphosphorus added the yield on the sterilized soil was about three times \nas much as on the unsterilized soil. \nHow important this biological immobilization of phosphorus may \nbe under various soil conditions is a problem that needs careful investigation.\nIt would seem, however, that in soils low in available phos-\nphorus, the addition of plant materials low in phosphorus but high \nin nitrogen and energy material may easily lead to phosphorus starvation\nof growing plants. On soils high in available phosphorus, on \nthe other hand, the temporary immobilization may be beneficial for \nit may decrease inorganic fixation of phosphorus and still allow sufficient.amounts\nof phsophorus to become available to plants gradually \nduring their growth. \nThe type of microorganisms involved may also play an important \nrole not only in the amounts of phosphorus immobilized but also in \nthe kind of compounds formed and in the rate at which inorganic \nphosphorus is subsequently released. What may be the difference, for \nexample, between fungal and bacterial populations? \nThe role of microorganisms in the P cycle is, therefore, a very dynamic\none. Changes in microbial population from day to day, in re-\nsponse to various environment factors may quickly alter the amounts \nof available phosphorus in soils. There is every reason to believe that \nthe significance of such everyday occurrences as waterlogging, drying, \nheating, and freezing of soils is not fully recognized nor evaluated. By \nincreasing or decreasing the microbial population and by changing \n', '10 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nits character these soil conditions may either result in the liberation of \nP for immediate use, or in the immobilization and conservation for \nfuture use. \nSOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AS MODIFIERS OF THE \nPHOSPHORUS CYCLE \nFrom what has already been said, it is evident that soil management\npractices may greatly modify the amounts of available phos-\nphorus found in soils. They do so in three ways, viz., (a) by changing \nthe type of compounds present, (b) by affecting the solubility of these \ncompounds, and (c) by altering the microbiological status of the soil. \nNearly every one of our common soil management practices such as \nliming, fertilization, drainage, tillage, and the additions of manures \nand crop residues may be expected to affect phosphorus availability \nin at least two of these ways. Liming, as previouSly mentioned, affects\nnot only the kind of .inorganic phosphate compounds and their \nsolubility but also the kind and solubility of phytin compounds. \nMoreover, -liming may favor the mineralization of the nucleic acid \ntype of phosphorus compounds by reducing their absorption by \nclays, as well as by increasing the activity of nuclease enzymes (28). To \nthe extent, however, that liming may cause rapid increases in microbial\nnumbers, and to the extent that liming in excess may result in the \nformation of basic calcium phosphates and possibly basic calcium \nphytates, the availability of phosphorus may at times be actually \nreduced (25). \nPhosphate fertilization is, of course, the most common means of increasing\nthe easily soluble or available phosphate compounds of soil. \nUnfortunately, the added phosphates usually revert rather rapidly \nin the soil to less available forms (24). This has been the subject of \nmany excellent investigations and although a number of management \npractices have been developecj. to minimize fixation, too large a pro.\nportion of the million and a half tons of phosphoric acid added in fer-\ntilizers .annually reverts to the "frozen assets" Class. As we learn more \nabout the phosphorus compounds of soils and the phosphorus cycle \nthis large loss should be reduced. \n· As to the effects of drainage and tillage practices on the phosphorus \ncycle, little information is available at present. It is probable, however,\nthat through their effects on the oxidation and reduction \nconditions in soils and also on the microbial population they may \nhave significant effects on phosphate availability. \nOf all the important soil management practices, manuring is probably\nthe least understood from the standpoint of its effect on the phos-\nphorus status of soils. The so-called reinforcement of manure with \nphosphate fertilizer has been generally recognized as advantageous. \nManure is relatively low in total phosphorus but this is perhaps not \nthe most important reason for the beneficial effects of phosphate \nsupplements. Little information is available on the forms in which \nphosphorus occurs in manure. It is probable that the compounds \npresent vary considerably. Manure from animals fed a ration high \nin cereal grains may be high in phytin, for phytin is evidently not as \n', 'PIERRE: THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE AND SOIL FERTILITY I I \nreadily dephosphorylated in the digestive tract as other organic phosphorus\ncompounds. On the other hand, manure from cattle fed rough-\nages, which are normally quite low in phytin, may contain most of \nthe organic phosphorus as nucleo proteins in the form of resynthesized \nmaterial present in microbial tissue. There is also a wide range in the \nnitrogen and energy materials in manure which will greatly affect the \nbiological fixation or immobilization of phosphorus during its decomposition.\nIt is possible, therefore, that under some conditions, at \nleast, manuring may actually accentuate the deficiency of phosphorus \nin soils and necessitate larger applications of phosphate fertilizers. \nThe same may also be true in the case of certain green manuring \npractices. \nTHE LARGER CYCLE \nReference has already been made to the use of phosphate fertilizers, \nthe most important external method by which the soil phosphorus \ncycle can be "recharged". In a sense this is a ph9-se of a world phosphorus\ncycle--a cycle in which the phosphorus accumulation in our \nlarge phosphate deposits and the return of this phosphorus to soils in \nthe form of fertilizers are counterparts. A consideration of the relation\nbetween phosphate fertilizer needs and use is beyond the scope \nof this discussion. It may be pointed out, however, that on the basis of \nrecent estimates, phosphate fertilizer consumption in this country is \nstill only about half of that required for efficient crop production (rs). \nOn the world basis, the discrepancy between need and use is probably \neven greater. \nThe replenishment of phosphorus in surface soils from deeper \nhorizons through the action of deep rooted crops is, as previously \nmentioned, the other important method by which phosphorus is \nbrought into the biological phase of the phosphorus cycle. It is well \nestablished that many of our most fertile soils contain large reserves \nof subsoil phosphorus (23) and there is growing evidence that certain \ncrops, such as the deep-rooted legumes, may make considerable use of \nthis phosphorus. Here again we need quantitative data if we are to \nestablish soil and crop management practices that make the fullest \nand most efficient use of our phosphorus resources. · \nSoil and crop management practices also have important over-all \neffects on losses of phosphorus from the revolving fund. Excessive \nerosion as a result of poor soil management practices may be expected \nto decrease the available phosphorus supplies in most soils. In prairie \nsoils the horizon below the plow layer is usually much lower in total \nand dilute acid soluble phosphorus than the surface soil; and crop \nresponse data show that eroded areas of Prairie soils are much more \ndeficient in available phosphorus than are uneroded areas. Moreover, \nit has been found that the losses of residual fertilizer phosphate by \nerosion may be quite large under certain conditions (29). \nCONCLUSION \nIn concluding this discussion, I would like to emphasize again that \nthere are many gaps in our knowledge of the phosphorus ,cycle. And \n', "12 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nit is obvious that these gaps need to be filled if we are to maintain \nsoils at a high level of fertility and use phosphate fertilizers efficiently. \nMany aspects of our knowledge are still in the descriptive stage. We \nneed better quantitative information on the amount, and availability \nof the various phosphate compounds present in soils, both organic \nand inorganic. Such information is essential to the improvement of \npresent methods of estimating the phosphorus need of soils, particularly\nof soils high in organic matter and those neutral and alkaline \nin reaction. It is also essential to the establishment of improved soil \nand crop management practices. \nIncreasing attention should be given, in particular, to the organic \nphosphorus compounds, their composition and their transformations \nin relation to plant availability. We need to know more about the \ndynamic, short-time changes in the cycle resulting from the activities \nof soil microorganisms, and the effect of various soil conditions on \nsuch transformations. Present indications are that the answers to \nsome of these problems are not far off. Much prQgress has been made \nin recent years, and the outlines of the picture are much clearer. \nMoreover, radio-active phosphorus offers particular promise in establishing\nthe nature and extent of the transformations in the phos-\nphorus cycle, as well as in determining the role of various soil phosphorus\ncompounds in plant nutrition. Isotopic forms of nitrogen and \ncarbon have already been used successfully in giving us the beginnings\nof a new concept regarding the nitrogen and carbon trans-\nformations in soils (4). Together with the use of radio-active phosphorus\nthey should make possible a much better understanding of the \nrelation between the nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus cycles in soils \nand of soil organic matter chemistry generally. \nAnd finally, I would emphasize that the important advances made \nrecently have come from pooling skills of various specialists. These \nresults make it clear that future progress lies along that line. \nLITERATURE CITED \n1. ANDERSON, R. J. Phytin and pyrophosphoric acid esters of inosite, II. New \nYork State Agr. Exp. Sta.
