Western Purchases Right of\nWay from R. P. Howell\nlamicates Lompany In\ntends to Close (lap.\nLake Charles American:\nA deed which was filed in the\ndistrict clerk\'s office today fore\nshadows that the long talked-of\nextension of the Lacasine branch\nfrom Lake Arthur to Gueydan\nmay soon become a reality.\nBy this conveyance, R. P. Ho\nwell of Lake Arthur transfers to\nthe Louisiana Western Railway\nCo., through its representative E.\nM. Campbell, a tract of land on\nthe west bank of the Mermentan\nriver containing 72 hundredths\nof an acre. The transfer is made\nin consideration of the sum of\none dollar and of the benefit\nwhich will assure by the con\nstruction of the line to Gueydan.\nUnless such line is constructed\nwithin two years of the date of\nthe transfer, the deed becomes\nvoid and the land reverts to the\noriginal owner.\nThe construction of a line from\nLake Arthur to Gueydan which\nwill connect two stub ends of the\nLouisiana Western so as to form\na continuous line from Lake\nCharles to New Iberia shorter\nthan the precent route has been\na favorable project for many\nyears. All along ,he line from\nLake Charles to Gueyden ten\nders of right-of-way for such a\nline have been frequently made\nto the Louisisau Western, but\nthis is the irst time that any\nhave been accepted or formally\ntransferred. Their acceptance\nindicates that for the first time\nthe railroad has a serious inten\ntion of taking up the project.\nIt pays to buy our suits be\ncause they have the fit, style,\nsad workmanship, and the price\nis always satisfactory.

Canada\'s greatest con\ncert band. The band was\ndressed in the costume of Scotch\nHighlanders, and their program\ncontained a number of the most\nbeautiful Scotch airs. The mus\nic rendered by them was very\npleasing and won repeated ap\nplause. The bagpipe numbers\nwere interesting and added\nmuch to the attractiveness of the\nentertainment because of its un\nusualness, but as for music\nwell it might be to one accus\ntomed to that kind of in\nstrument. Mr. Angus Fraser\'s\nsword dance was good and\nshowed him to be both graceful\nand supple as well as artistic.\nThe Highland reel was very pleas\ning both on account of its novelty\nand the skill of the dancers.\nBut the best of all was Mr. Fra\nser\'s Sailor\'s Horn Pipe. His\ndancing was simply fine and he\ngot an enthusiastic encore. To\nlovers of good music the "Kilties"\nwill always be welcome.\nSnew.White.\nNo doubt on Thursday evening,\nFeb. 27, the Jefferson Theatre\nwill be filled to pay tribute to the\nbeautiful fairy play, "Snow\nWhite," and the cause for which\nthis superb operetta is presented\nin lafayette.

Herri\nman when asked if be expected\nto realise the Intention expressed\n;twelve months ago that he\nl.mght retire from business in\nsaodher year. Mr. Harriman\nseld:\n"Well, it is not a case olishangh\nagr my mind.

When the sentence "dismissal\nwith ignominy" is passed upon an of\nficer it means that his brother officers\nmay never speak to him again during\nhis life. If this officer has a relative\nin the service, no matter how close\nthe -connection may be, there must\nnever again be communication be.\ntween the two.\nIt It is a young man who is thus\nAismissed and he has a father in the\narmy or navy, they are cut off for\nover unless the father should choose\nto quit the nation\'s service also.\nAnd w:icn the sentence is once\npassed it is unchangeable. A man\nwho simply violates the laws of the\ncountry even to the point of trea\nson has a chance for pardon, but once\nhe receives the document bearing the\nphrase "dismissal with ignominy," it\nstands just as long as there is breath in\nhis body.\nEven if he wishes to enlist in the\nservice as one of the men in the\nranks this would not be Ilowed. When\ncaught he would be punished for\n"fraudulent enlistment."\nIn the old days the greatest punish\nment was to cashier an officer. Then\nhe would be taken out before an as\nsembled body of troops or sailors and\nhis insignia of rank would be taken\nand his sword broken. Now this has\nOiven way to a more complete method\nit exposing his shame. When an of\nAcer is "dismissed with ignominy" it\nii ordered by the president that no\ntice shall be sent to all members of\nthe service and the crime and the\npunishment is published in the news\npapers not only around the headquar\nters where he was last on duty, but\nalso in the state from which he comes\nor in which he usually makes his\nhome.\nA Technical Explanation.\nIt is said that unless one can impart\ninformation one does not really pos*\nsess It. The late Prof. Angelo Hellprin\nused to tell a story, says the Washing\nton Star, Illustrative of this point. The\nprofessor himself had a most learned\nand lucid mind. Not\' only could he\nmaster a question; he could lay it so\nclearly before you that you became\nmaster of it, too.\nTwo commercial travelers on the\nway from Reading to Philadelphia\nonce got into an argument over the\naction of the vacuum brake.\n"It\'s the inflation of the tube that\nstops the train," declared the first\ntraveler.\n"Wrong, wrong!" shouted the sec\ncad. "It\'s the output of the exhaus\ntion."\nSo they wrangled for an hour. Then,\nwhen the train arrived in Philadelphia\nthey agreed to submit the matter for\nsettlement to the engineer. That gen\ntlemap, leaning condescendingly from\nthe window of his cab, listened with\nan attentive frown to the two travel.\ners\' statement of their argument.\nThem he smiled, shook his head and\nsaid:\n"Well, gents, ye\'re .both wrong\nabout the workin\' of the vacuum brake\nYet if\'s very simple and easy to an\nderstand.\' When we want to\'stop the\ntrain we Just turn this \'ere tap, and\nthea we fall the pipe with vacuum."\nlitbered Her Meinrey.\nR ias saimply a colailtence that\nmade the theituag of the monument\nto t e gs Vie sels at.Ksith; Scotlaad.\nI, place em the same day as the pub\n,sr SuK robse @of letters.\nthe address\nu Api 1sd~ "ant the\nit a em that she tendered\nas \' s te etseat of Lea trataing and.\non tl ,nestent.

TO\nGENERAL RULE.\nJudge Pitman Found Out Its Charac\nter in a Short Time-Book\'s De\nscription Not Correct In\nThis Case.\nJudge Pitman, a short time ago,\nbought a pet lamb for his little chil\ndren to play with. It was a pretty\ngood-sized lamb, and strong and vig\norous; but the judge said he preferred\nthat kind, because the children would\nbe less likely to hurt it.\nOn the day that it came home they\nturned it out. into the front yard.\nwhere it strayed about nibbling the\ngrass, while the judge tied up his\ngeraniums.\nMrs. Pitman had the children in the\nhouse and she was reading to them\nfrom a book a description of the char\nacteristics of lambs. The account\nsaid that "The lamb is one of the most\nplayful and innocent of animals. So\nkind and meek is it that its name has\nfor centuries been the synonym of gen\ntleness and sweetness of disposition.\nIt never injures any one, and when it\nis attacked it always suffers humbly\nand in silence. There is something so\nbeautiful about the gentle little animal\nthat-"\nJust at this point Mrs. Pitman was\ninterrupted by the voice of the judge\ncoming from the front yard. It\nsounded as if he were in distress of\nsome kind.\nThe whole family flew out upon the\nporch, and there they saw that pet\nlamb, whose name was the synonym\nof gentleness, engaged in butting the\njudge. It would butt him in the rear\nand knock him over, and then it would\nbutt him in the legs, any\' batter him\non the ribs, and plunge its head into\nhis stomach, and jam its skull against\nhis chest. When he rose it butted his\nshins, and when he stooped over to\nrub them it butted his head. Then it\nbutted him generally wherever a\nchance presented itself; and when it\nhad doubled the judge all up under\nthe norway maple, it butted sown\nthree rose bushes, butted a plaster\ngarden vase to fragments, butted two\npalings off of the fence, and danced\noff down the street, butting at the tree\nboxes, the hitching posts and the\nnorthwest wind. -\nMr. Potter finally knocked it in the\nhead with a club and brought it home\nto the judge; and subsequently, when\nthey had the hind leg for dinner, the\njudge observed to Mrs. Pitman that\nfrom the manner in which that lamb\ncut he should believe that it was\nborn during the war of 1812, and that\nit was, in fact, a terrific old ram. Then\nhe said he should go down to see the\nman who sold it to him for a lamb\nand bang him with a club.\nThe Pitman children will cling to\nkittens as regular pets.-New York\nWeekly.\nPunctilious Etiquette.\nRe-Did you have an informal di1\nsussion at your club, my dear?\nShe (primly)-Our diseussions are\nsever informal.

Remember this when coming in 1\nlate with the horses from a long drive\nover the muddy roads. Takes lot of\ngumption, but see that they are\nrtbbed off and made comfortable for 1\nthe night before leaving them.\nCalves must have clean, dry pens if\nthey would be thrifty. A filthy wet\npen, especially for very young calves,\nis apt to derange their stomachs.\nWhile a cement floor is ideal, it takes\nlots of bedd.ng 2o keep it dry. A light\npen is also very desirable. Every calf\nlien should have a window where the\nsunlight can get in. Sunlight is one\nof the best disenfectantt that God ever\ngave to man. It is the cheapest also;\ntherefore use plenty of it In the barns.\nHere is a recipe for tanning skins\nwith the hair on which is said to be\nrood, although we have not tried it.\nWhen the skin is fresh, powder the\nflesh side with a mixture of salt two\nparts, alum and saltpeter each one\npart, and roll tightly, letting it lie\nuntil the mixture is thoroughly dis\nsolved. This mixture should be pul\nverized before being applied. Then\nstretch the hide on a board and scrape\noff all flesh or membrane that may ad\nhere to it. Then dry in the sus and\ncover with neat\'s foot oil, after which\nit should be laid away for a few days.\nNext scrape as clean as possible with\na piece of wood, and apply Spanish\nwhiting which has been heated in an\noven until it is hot, rubbing it with a\nflannel cloth. The skin is now ready\nfor use, and it at all stiff, may be\nrubbed and worked soft with but lit\ntle trouble.\nTogether in Death, as in Life.\nThirty years ago in an Edinburgb\nschool there were three pupils who\nwere so intimate and inseparable\ncompanions that they were designated\nFaith, Hope and Charity. After leav\ning school they continued as warmly\nattached as ever. Indeed, the con\nstant appearance of the trio together\n"at kirk and market" became a stand\ning joke. By and by they married\nwithin short intervals of each other.\nThey had each three children and the\nfamilies grew up together in close\nfriendship. Some three years ago one\nof the three died suddenly and short\nly afterward, with equal suddenness,\nanother passed away. A few months\nlater the third died after two or three\ndays\' illness. Thus within one short\nyear, in the prime of life, the threw\nwho on earth had been all but inse*\narable, passed away.\nINTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETIC\nAND ORATORICA ASSOCIATION\nSection VIII.

Pausing in an account of his\ntour. Dr. Jaches said:\n"Abroad, as here at home, the great\npublic\'s knowledge of the rays con\ntinues rather vague. Investigators re\nceive all manner of queer letters and\nrequests. Thus I heard in Berlin of a\nman who wrote to a specialist:\n"\'Dear Sir: I have had a bullet in\nmy thorax for 11 years. I am too busy\nto come to Berlin, but hope you will\ncome down here with your rays, as my\ncase should be worth your while. If\nyou cannot come, send a packet of\nrays, with instructions as to use, etc.,\nand I will see if I cannot manage to\nwork them myself.\'\n"The specialist replied:\n"Dear Sir: I am sorry that my\nengagements prevent my coming to see\nyou, and that I am out of rays just\nnow. If you cannot come to Berlin\nyourself, send me your thorax by ex\npress and I will do the best I can\nwith It.\'"\nOur stock of bulk garden seeds\nis much better than ever before.\nWe guarantee these seed to grow.\nMoss Pharmacy.\nMan at His Best.\nAt what age is a man at his best\nand most likely to achieve his life\nwork? The Rev. F. B. Meyer once\nput the age at 46. That seemed late\nto a critic, but Dr. Leonard Guthrie\nat the Royal College of Physicians\nsupported this statement. He quoted\nJastre\'s table dealing with specially\nprecocious people, which showed that\nthe average age at which great ar\ntists did their first work was 13.8;\ntheir first great work, 28; their great\neat work, 46.7; and that the average\nage at death was 60.1. For poets the\nfigures in the same order were 15.6,\n27.8, 43.9 and 61.6; for philosophers,\n17.6, 32.1, 47.7 and 66.3. Here is\ncomfort for those who think of mid\ndie life as fiat prose.\nDon\'t send away for your gar\nden seed, we can save you money\nand guarantee our seeds.-Moss\nPharmacy.\nHer Revenge.\nOn a crowded street car recently\nthere were several stout men taking\nup more room than they should. A\nslip of a girl got on and the ceduetor\ncalled out "move up, please." They re\nluctantly moved about six inches and\nthe girl squeezed in. A few minutes\nlater a tremendously stout woman\nladen with parcels entered and the\ngirl immediately offered her her seat,\nwhich she accepted. The selish men\nwere lost to view under 250 pounds\nof stoutness and the girl chuckled to\nherself.\nOnion sets, onion sets, onion\nsets, onion sets at Moss Phar\nmacy.']</pre>
