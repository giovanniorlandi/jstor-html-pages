        <pre>['* Corresponding author: straga98@mail.ru \nDialectological description of the Russian language functioning \nin the Baidar Valley of Greater Sevastopol \nNatalia Antonenko1,*, and Tatiana Teplova1 \n1Sevastopol Branch of Lomonosov Moscow State University, 7, Geroev Sevastopolia, 299001, Sevastopol, Russia \nAbstract. The paper discusses the main stages of investigation into the dialectological situation in the South \nof Russia, with special attention being given to the studies of territories close to the Republic of Crimea. This \npaper presents findings from a field study of the Russian language functioning in an isolated area. We \ninvestigate speech of the people living in Greater Sevastopol to identify peculiar features in phonetics, word \nbuilding, morphology and syntax. Our respondents are both natives and migrants from various regions. The \nregiolect of Sevastopol is analysed in terms of dialect bases and their correlation, time of migration. Our \nresults show positive relationship between the respondents linguistic and biographic background. The speech \nof the respondents exhibits a high degree of similarity with the Russian literary language, and demonstrates \nfeatures of the closely related Ukrainian language. The influence of Ukrainian is more pronounced at the \nphonetic level and less evident at the lexical level. \n1. Introduction  \nChanges in the language require ongoing and accurate \nregistration since “it is difficult for the collector of \ndialectal material and a dictionary compiler to identify an \nitem which stands behind the lexeme reported by the \nsubject and a semantic description follows the context \nimmediately which can lead to serious mistakes difficult \nto find in a consolidate dictionary and to correct” [1]. \nIn 1972 N. A. Meshchersky qualified a more accurate \nclassification of Russian accents as one of the tasks of \ndialectology. Such classification should depict dialects in \nall areas where Russian is spoken [2]. Present-day \npolitical and economic processes intensified stratification \nand changes of dialect idioms. It makes the social trend in \nresearch of Russian accents currently important. \nTraditional accents are modifying, losing some \narchaic features and acquiring new ones. In contemporary \nscience these transformed dialects are referred to as \nregiolects. \nAccording to the opinion of the authors who study \nfeatures of linguistic mapping in describing language \nfunctioning in a bounded locality, “describing the making \nof new sociolects and regiolects, their shaping together \nwith dialect recomposition of the Russian language is an \nimportant task in modern dialectology” [3]. Such \ndescription is directly related with the fact that regional \nusage has always been different in the Russian speaking \nterritory. But it is obvious for those who find themselves \nin an unusual language environment. And those who don’t \nmigrate much are not aware of the non-normativity of \ntheir patterns of usage [4].  \nE. V. Brysina, R. I. Kudryashova and V. I. Suprun in \ntheir article “Present-day dialects lexicography: issues \nand developmental trends” consider heterogeneity of \ndialects and divergent ways of regional dialects genesis as \none of the main issues. They prove that areas where \nRussians were original inhabitants are dialectally \nhomogenious, while the areas where Russians settled later \nare characterised by heterogeneous accents [5].  \nThe situation in the area around Sevastopol and in \nGreater Sevastopol is rather complex. The works on \ndialectology do not discuss the features of accents of later \nsettlers of this and some other areas. The region is not \ndepicted on the dialect area maps of the year 1965. \nAccording to the dialects map of the Russian language in \nEurope constructed by N. N. Durnovo, N. N. Sokolov and \nD. N. Ushakov in 1914 and elaborated by N. N. Durnovo \nin 1927 the Crimea was classified as the area of Little \nRussian accents as well as the territories of Lvov, \nKharkov and Ekaterinoslav located in different parts of \nUkraine [6]. Such distribution does not take into \nconsideration many factors which we will discuss later. \nHowever, the Crimean territory is marked as territory \nwhere the Russian-speaking population makes up less \nthan 50% of the general quantity population makes up less \nthan 50% of the general quantity of inhabitants. \nThe complexity of systematization and \ncharacterization are associated with the difficulties of \nanalyzing and classifying heterogeneous and mixed \ndialects. It is noteworthy that part of the territories \nallocated by the Moscow dialectological commission \n(MDC) were not included in the maps of the \nDialectological Atlas of the Russian language. Among the \nterritories not included in the Atlas and closest to the \nCrimea and Sevastopol is the area within the Southern \nGreat Russian division represented by the southern part of \nSHS Web of Conferences 69, 00006 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/20196900006\nCILDIAH-2019\n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The dialects map of the Russian language in Europe \nconstructed in 1914. The Crimea is classified as the area of \nLittle Russian accents (the green field). \nThe 3rd edition of the “Russian Dialectology” \ntextbook, edited by L. L. Kasatkin, updates the dialectal \ndivision of the Russian language and describes the \nterritories of the late formation of the Southern division \n(the Don complexes [8], but the language situation in the \nmodern Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol still remains \nunlit. It should be noted that the variability of the Russian \nlanguage in the Crimea is recognized as a pressing issue \nof dialectology [9], a group of dialects is included) and \ntheir language  \n \n \nFig. 2. The map of the Dialectological Atlas of the Russian \nlanguage. The Crimea and Sevastopol are not included. \nThe complexity of the systemic description of the \nRussian language functioning within the region (the \nRussian language regiolect) becomes apparent if we try to \ncharacterize the regiolect using the system proposed by \nL. I. Barannikova [10]. From the point of view of the \nnature of the dialect basis of the accent, the Sevastopol \nregiolect is rarer than the bi-dialect or polydialect type, \nwhich is connected with the historical conditions of the \nformation of the population. Modern residents of Greater \nSevastopol are natives or descendants of immigrants from \nKursk, Voronezh, Bryansk, Tver regions of the modern \nRussian Federation and Bessarabia, Vinnitsa, \nTranscarpathia, Donetsk regions of Ukraine. In the past \nfew decades, speakers of an unrelated Crimean Tatar \nlanguage have been added to them, making the language \nenvironment even more heterogeneous.  \nSuch heterogeneous situation complicates the \ndetermination of the ratio of dialectal bases and allows \ntalking about two types of dialects: dialectal diversity of \naccents (significant differences at the level of different \ngroups of dialects and language divisions, complicated by \na foreign language environment) and / or a foreign \nlanguage environment (interaction of Russian accents of \n2\nSHS Web of Conferences 69, 00006 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/20196900006\nCILDIAH-2019\n', " \nimmigrants with both closely related and unrelated \nlanguages). \nLate resettlement time allows us to talk about primary \nmigratory accents and the differentiation of the nature of \nthe relationship with the native accents. At the same time, \nthe task of determining the native accent itself does not \nlose its importance. \nThe Russian language in Sevastopol was the subject \nof an independent study within the framework of \nmonitoring the Russian language functioning in \nSevastopol. The study was held on the initiative of the \nSevastopol City Council in 2007. The results of this \nmonitoring will be used as one of the basis of the research. \nThe Russian language in Crimea was the subject of a \nstudy within the framework of the Global Russian studies \nproject (georusistika) conducted by prof. A. N. Rudyakov \n(Simferopol) on the basis of a hypothesis about the \nexistence of a special Ukrainian version of the Russian \nlanguage. At the same time, the available data are rather \nfragmented and mosaic in nature, dealing mainly with \nlexical innovations. These data do not adequately \ncharacterize active processes in the regiolect, and the \nregiolect has not been the subject of a special research \nwith the use of special methods. \nAs noted in [11], a systematic description of a \nregiolect functioning requires consideration of \nextralinguistic factors that form the national, cultural and \npolitical identity of the population with various cultural \nsettings, ethnicity and religious denominations. From this \npoint of view, the Sevastopol region (Greater Sevastopol) \nis  close to a reference region and the issues discussed \nabove are typical for it. \nSince the end of the Great Patriotic War various \npolitical processes have taken place on the territory of \nSevastopol (liberation of the peninsula, transfer of the \nregion from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR, existence \nwithin the post-Soviet Ukraine, reunification with \nRussia). Each of these processes is accompanied by mass \nmigrations of the population. A logical consequence is a \nchange in the system of education connected with the \nteaching of Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar \nlanguages in schools.. \n2. Materials and methods \nWe have developed a questionnaire for conducting \ndialectological and sociolinguistic studies in Greater \nSevastopol and Crimea. \nGiven the specifics of the study, the interviewers did \nnot inform the respondents about the real objectives of the \nsurvey. In order to avoid deliberate distortion of speech in \nthe direction of the codified norm, the respondent was \ninformed of the expedition’s local history purposes. This \nmade it possible to obtain audio recordings reflecting the \npresent language situation. \nAccording to Yu. L. Sit’ko, the grammar and \nphonetics of the urban vernacular in the Crimea and \nSevastopol correlate with koine as the main means of \neveryday communication in various communicative \nspheres in regular social contacts [12]. This statement is \napplicable to Greater Sevastopol as well. Our findings \ninclude phonetic, morphological, syntactic and lexical \naspects of speech. At the same time, linguistic and \nbiographical information correlate positively. \n3. Results \nWe identify three groups of respondents: immigrants from \nthe RSFSR, immigrants from the Ukrainian SSR and \nnatives of the region. In most cases, Russian was \nmentioned as the native language, but there were cases of \ndifficulty in answering this question (“I don’t know which \none” and “I normally speak”). Lyubov V, born in 1939, a \nnative of Vinnytsia region, in whose speech the features \nof the Ukrainian literary language are more pronounced \nthan those of Russian, replied: [men'i ne zdajets'a sho ja \npo \xa0 ukrajins’komu rozgavarivayu] (I \xa0 don’t \xa0 think \xa0 that \xa0 I \xa0\nspeak Ukrainian). Maria Ts., of the same age and from the \nsame region as Lyubov V., characterized her spoken \nlanguage as follows: [a \xa0 vzhe \xa0 v’in u mene tak polovynu \nrusky/polovynu ukrains’ky// \xa0 ja \xa0 fse \xa0 pon’imaju \xa0 po \xa0 rus’ky/ \xa0\npo \xa0 ukrajins’ky \xa0 i \xa0 koje \xa0 shto \xa0 po \xa0 n’imetsky \xa0 pon’imaju] (I \nspeak half Russian, half Ukrainian. I understand \neverything in Russian, in Ukrainian, and I understand \nsomething in German). \nMigrants retain language features which are typical for \ntheir region. So, the speech of the representatives of the \nfirst group is distinguished by a complete akanie (reduced \npronunciation of unstressed [о] as [а]), which is typical of \nthe Russian literary language. Respondents from the \nsecond group demonstrate partial okanie (retention of \nunstressed [o]), which can be explained by their origin and \na long stay in a heterogeneous environment. \nThe situation in the group of the natives of the region \nis rather unclear. Lyubov S. was born in 1947 in a family \nof immigrants from the Voronezh region, received a \nsecondary education. Her speech reveals akanie \n([karova]) and okanie simultaneously ([ovosh':i]), the \nconvergence of the sounds [i] and [y], as, for example, in \nthe word [pryjehal'i]. However, this feature is neither \npermanent in the speech of the respondent nor ubiquitous \nin the surveyed territory.  \nAll three groups of the research participants \npronounce unvoiced labio-dental sounds [f] and [f'] for \nphonemes phonemes <v> and <v '>. The bilabial \nallophones [w], [w'] and [ў] were demonstrated by \nrespondents who migrated from Transcarpathia and \nBessarabia. This feature is not present in the speech of \nimmigrants from other regions of the Ukrainian SSR. \nVoiced back-lingual consonants are mainly explosives \nand often are presented as [γ] and [γ’]. This is typical for \nboth settlers and the natives. Even more frequent is the \nunvoicing of the back-lingual sounds [g] and [g '] both as \n[k]/[k'], and [kh]/[kh']. \nWe have observed cases of dissimilation of fricative \nconsonants ([obshch'ezhyt'ije], [konkhv'eta]), but these \ncases are not regular. Instead of [j] after the consonant \nbefore the vowel, there can be a zero of sound: [sv'in'a], \n[tr'et'em]. \nSome respondents demonstrate diaeresis of unstressed \nvowels. This mainly refers to post-tonic syllables, \nespecially to the final open syllable. And the center of the \n3\nSHS Web of Conferences 69, 00006 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/20196900006\nCILDIAH-2019\n", ' \nsyllable is usually transferred to a consonant sound: \n[vаzhаto(о)j], [е́t(oо) sа́mаjе]. \nWord-building models absolutely coincide with the \nmodels of the Russian literary language. Modern trends of \nword formation (the formation of nouns with the suffix "izatsia",\nthe prefixes of the size-valued semantics ("giper-\n", "super-" ..), the prefixes of the opposition "de-", "anti-" \nand others) are not found in the respondents speech.  \nThe morphology and syntax are generally consistent \nwith the codified norm, although a number of fluctuations \nare noted. One of the deviations from the norm is a change \nin the gender of the noun. The feminine nouns are \nreplaced by the neutral and vice versa: [tri dе́rеvа/ n’i \nоdnа́ nе vrоdilа] (three trees and none of them produced \nfruits) and [pach\'imuta \xa0mn’e \xa0uch’enija \xa0n’eshla] (For some \nreason, I did not succeed in school). Extremely common \nin the speech of all three groups of respondents are the \nword forms of the demonstrative pronoun "tot", "vot", \n"tut": "toi", "ot/oto", "otut" respectively. The normative \nending [y\\i] is replaced with the ending [a]: pochorona \nnachalis’ \xa0 and mater’a (plural of the lexeme mat’). The \nending [if] may replace [of]: [staryk\'if], [muzhyk\'if], \n[pravnuk\'if]. \nThe plural form of the instrumental case of names can \nget the ending [amy] for nouns and pronouns: [d\'itkamy], \n[vamy], [kustamy]. \nForms of the nominative case singular of masculine \nadjectives and pronouns are pronounced with the stressed \nending [yj]: [khvatkyj], [takyj]. \nIn the genitive case of masculine and neuter genders \nin adjectives and impersonal pronouns, the ending is \nformed with the consonant [v]: polno[v]o, interesno[v]o, \ntako[v]o. \nThe reflexive postfix after vowels can take the form \n"sya": uchilasya, vypuskalasya, obshchalisya.  \nThe preposition "iz" can be replaced with the \npreposition "s": vypuskalasya s sadika, lozhkami s odnogo \nkazana, ona s goroda priezhaet.  \nSome variations in the syntax system are explained by \nthe interference of closely related languages. This is most \nclearly manifested in the interaction of prepositions and \nnouns and is accompanied by a fluctuation of the \nmorphological system. Examples of such changes are the \nstatements [robili na tabaku] and [uchilisya \xa0v \xa0khutor’i]. \nThe lexicon of respondents coincides with the lexicon \nof the Russian language. According to Yu. L. Sit’ko, this \nexplains the absence of very bright features in the wordformation\nsystem of Sevastopol, and the existing new \nwords completely fit into the word-formation system of \nthe Russian literary language [12]. Deviations from the \nnorm may refer to the so-called "individual" lexicon. \n4. Discussion \nOur paper presents result of the field study of the Russian \nlanguage functioning in the isolated area. It was the first \nlinguistic research that was held on the Baidar Valley site. \nThe results of our survey are confirmed in [11]. Relatively \nlow indicator of confirming can be attributed to the low \nstate of studied question knowledge. Our research allows \nus to expand the boundaries of the Russian language \ndialectological description on the territories, which were \nnot investigated before. Minor flaws of investigation can \nbe explained by human factors and\\or technical \ndifficulties. Nevertheless, these shortcomings did not \nhave a significant impact on the results of the study. \n5. Conclusion \nThe speech of the respondents is characterized by a high \ndegree of similarity with the Russian literary language, \nand demonstrates features of closely related Ukrainian. \nThese features are most clearly manifested in the phonetic \naspect, less explicitly in morphology and syntax, and \nalmost not reflected in the lexical system. \n \nThe research is sponsored by the government of Sevastopol and \nRussian Foundation of Fundamental Research (grant number \n18-412-920001 “The Russian language functioning in \nSevastopol as a projection of social, ethnic and cultural policy in \nthe second half of the 20th - early 21st century: dialectalogical \nand \xa0historical \xa0description \xa0and \xa0mapping”). \nReferences \n1.
