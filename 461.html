Oct. lo.-It was\nlearned today at the state department\nthat the United States probably will\nappoint a member of the League of Na\ntions commission which will try to\nettle the Aaland Islands dispute be\ntween Finland and Swceden.\nA permanent commission shall be constituted to advise the\nCouncil on the execution of the provisions of Articles 1 and VI 11\nand on military, naval and air questions generally.\nFor i ii .-in y years peace workers have dem.\'inded the re\nduction of armaments. It was hoped that. th- first Hague\nconference would bring this about. As all the world knows\nthis hope was in vain. Nation raced nation in an effort to\nhave the largest anil best equipped lighting force. (J-crmany\nhad out-stripped all the nations of Europe and felt itself ready\nto take over the mastery of the world. If Article VIII alone\nof the covenant had been in force in 1914 the world war would\nnot have been possible.\nA country not prepared for war will think twice before\ndeclaring war; with a universal reduction of :arinament dis\nputes between nations would be settled by diplomacy and ar\nbitration. The Council is authorized by Article VH1 to determine\nand recommend what military equipment a,nd armament is\nfair and reasonable for each member nation in proportion to\nthe scale fixed in the general program of disarmament. After\nthis is done each nation, acting in its own sovereignty and\naccording to its own laws shall take the rceramendations of\nthe Council under advisement.\nThe Council ean only advise and re Join mend the limit\nupon armaments according to the scale fixed. The United\nStates would not have a limited armam ent placed upon it\nwithout t lie action of congress.\nThe only obligation feature is found in eLause 4, and that\nis if t lu-\nLcague\nbe increased or changed without the consent oJ! the Council, of\nwhich this country would be one of the contro lling factors.\nThe plan of armaments must be submitted to a new exam\nination at least every ten years. If an alteration is decided\nupon the League states are free to accept or :i -eject it.\nThe heavy reduction which the treaty of Versailles im\nposes upon the armaments of Germany will .help to facilitate\nthe Council\'s recommendations.\nThe evil of private manufacture of muni tions and imple\nments of war has long been recognized, but no authority is\ngiven on this subject and the Council can onjy advise.\nAn original member of the League has th right to accept\nor reject the armament provisions, but a non-1 league state ap\nplying for membership in the League is bom d to accept the\nregulations imposed upon it by the Council.\ni\ni\nTo Investigate Killings\nBy United Press\nW SH 1NGTON, Oct. 16.

"Do you expect the senate of the Tinted States." they ask. "to\nbe a mere rubber-stamp to do what the pnileiit tells them to do?"\nNo. "Doesn\'t the constitution provide that the senate shall confirm\nevery treaty before it can ;o into eil\'ect?" Yes. "Do you want the\nsenate to neglect its obligations?" Not at all. "Then why shouldn\'t\nthe senators scrutinize the treaty?\'-\' They should. Here usually\nfollows a torrent of intense vituperation against 1 \'resident Wilson for\nnot taking "somebody" from the senatt with the name of Senator\nLodge usually implied along with him to help formulate the treaty.\nIt is hard to get a word in edgewise when this (low of talk is started,\nbut after all is said and the cool of the evening is upon us, the fact\nremains that if the treaty had been signed without delay the League\nof Nations would have had the real start that was contemplated by\nmen of good will, and that its defects might well have been discover\ned and remedied all the sooner. This means also that the league\nwould have spoken with such authority as, very likely, to have stop\nped the bloodshed that is even yet going on; it means that great\nliumantarian undertakings would have been bringing hope out of\ndespair: it means that the hundreds of thousands of men and women\nand children, from Danzig clear south to Armenia, who are to this\nday rotting of disease, who are writhing in the black night of in\nsanity from suffering, would have been brought back to health and\ndecent living conditions. The price of this achievement to tlu prev\nious liepubliean majority in the senate would have been a political\nadvantage to President Wilson, whereas the rule of polities is to\ncripple the opposition. The political advantage to the president is\nthe one price that Lodge, Knox, Penrose and followers, including th\nRepublican candidate, would not pay.\nIt is curious on what little issues great events turn. The !\npublican senators were indignant because they could get no credit\nfor making the treaty. Of course, the making of treaties is the busi\nness of the executive and not of the senate, but they wanted an ail\nvantage, a talking point, a scare-head, a thing to which they could\n"point with pride" as a special liepubliean achievement. When,\nfinally they got the treaty they threshed around in despair until\nsomething happened. How it happened 1 do not pretend to know.\nAccording to gossip, their leader. Lodge, saw the Hon. Klihu Hoot,\na man of immense ability who has rendered great service to the coun\ntry but who also retains a touch of guile. Mr. lioot is said to have\nread the treaty and to have pointed out a political issue in Article X.\nWhether this is true or not, or whether Lodge conjured up his sorry\ncomedy out of his own mind, is not important at present. The cf\nremaii s that Article X was selected as the talking point. Of course.\nLodge knew, as every intelligent citizen knows, that this country can\nnot go to war except by declaration of congress. It was merely a\ntalking point, useful to dely action just as the reading of back num\nbers of the Congressional JJecord is part of a speech of a senator who\nwants to delay a measure to death. There are plenty of other feat\nures of the proposed league that are open to criticism, but here was\none that could be made to look more important than it Avas, which\nwas what was wanted. So they talked and talked until the on\nthing that could have saved the league was dead; the quality of faith,\namong nations. When this opportunity for world welfare was gone\nthey loaded the treaty up with reservations which destroyed the\nspirit of the agreement and then passed it. Whether the president\nwas right or wrong to hazard Ihe attempt to persuade other nations\nto accept such a mutiliated \'proposal is not very important, anyway.\nThe time to do the right thing, the big thing, the time for this coun\ntry to join so as to make the league a living body was over.\nThis act, the destruction of ihe plan for world agreement and\nworld peace, seems to me a vertiable cataclysm of dishonor, l-\'or a\npiffling little advantage, because their feelings were hurt, because\nthey were not invited to go to Paris and humiliate the president over\nthere if they could, those liepubliean senators with a few Democrats\nto help them, have done this thing to humanity. Of course the;\nmake excuses and say the plan never would have succeeded any way.\nlint we know that it might have succeeded if we had had men of\ngood will instead of men of wrath to represent us in the senate. The\nguilt, as I see it, rests on the shoulders of these men. and I believe\nit will follow them to their graves and brand them with shame on tin\npages of history.\nNow we are asked to vote for one of their number who admits\nthat he has not even a policy in regard to the greatest question be\nfore us and who openly rejoices at the opportunity to yield his\njudgment and authority to the very men who, with him, have made\nso many of us ashamed because they caused our country to fail the\nworld in its hour of need. Have we sunk so low that we have lost all\nthe ideals for which our brave boys died? Did Theodore lioosevel:\nin his prime, teach us to falter? Did (trover Cleveland live in vain?\nHas Hearst become the spirtual leader of our people! Can\'t we even\ntell the difference between our own ideals of only a few years ag\nand this weasel shiftiness of partisan polities? What if Tammany\ndid help to nominate Cox, and what if some of his campaign methods\nare occasionally criticised? What are such things compared to the\ndishonor of this country, tried in the councils of the nations of the\nearth and found wanting because it refused to play its part. Re\nfused to play its part after our best and bravest had given their all\nso that we might play our part.\nThe sick man in Washington lias finished his work. He has had\nmany faults, but he had ideals of peace and good will among men.\nLodge, Knox and their little coterie of politicians, by their narrow\nness and their whippit ambitions have killed the faith that made\nthose ideals possible. It does not seem honorable to intrust the gov\nernment and welfare of our people to them. If we elect Cox and\nRoosevelt we shall speak to them in the only language they can un-i\nderstand. The great opportunity is lost, but we can begin again to\n4 i 4i i.: e . tf i I\niiiiiiii nmue.Miv untaiu t ne ;icmt- em.-in oi peace li, neiween now j\nand election dav we can iret back our J st idea\'s and close nor ears!\nto the gospel of selfishness and scuttle and broken faith and malice\njthat confuse Republican leaders of the present day.\nMissing 0,000\nTl\nDM m 111 \'SPEED MANIAC\nT\nC.
