And how\nis the catastrophe to be avoided?\n"Here we "are, English, Irish,\nFrench, Germans, Russians and\nAmericans, shipwrecked together\nand liable to perish. The doctrine of\nself-subsistence will save none of us;\nfor what happens to Vienna tomor\nrow may happen to Paris or London\nthe week or year after. The more\nmilitary or the more primitive\nstocks might, indeed, survive a gen\neral crash of civilization. But man\ndoes not always want to be living\nthe centuries over again. The trou\nble is that the imminent peril of so\nciety remains unexplored and almost\nunguessed by it. While man fears\nwhat is really not fearful at all the\nlos3 of comfort or the spread of the\ndoctrine of equality he does not\ndread the most horrible thing that\ncould happen to him, namely, the\nloss of all sense of unity of the hu\nman race."\nWherefore the writer proposes a\nremarkable remedy: "Why not try\nChristianity?" He insists that "the\nmere day-by-day observance of the\ncentral Christian precept, which is\nthe Golden Rule, would suffice to\nstop war, famine, plague and most\nsocial diseases, and to , raise the\nwhole western world to an unimag\ninable condition of happiness, beau\nty and wealth."

One thou\nsand three hundred and forty-five\nchildren were administered to by the\nChildren\'s Home society of Florida\nduring the year 1921. "according to\nthe annual report of Marcus C.\nFagg, superintendent of the home.\nThree hundred and sixty were under\nsupervision during the first of the\nyear, Mr. Fagg stated. A total of\ni04 was receiving aid from the home\nat that time, he said, of which 461\nwere boys and 443 girls. Two hun\ndred were babies between the ages\nof six hours and three years.\nMr. Fagg placed prominent in the\naccomplishments of the home during\nthe year the placing of children ei\nther fatherless or motherless in the\ncare of private homes. Previously\nthe home had conducted a boarding\nschool for children whose single par\nents could not give them attention\nbecause of him or her having to\nwork. Not only was the cost of car\ning for each child reduced by placing\nit in a selected boarding house, Mr.\nFagg stated, but it proved to be\nmuch to the advantage of the youngster.\nTAMPA PHYSICIANS\nABLE TO WRITE IT 1922\nTampa, Feb. 6.

If the birth of a per\nson had been recorded as having oc\ncurred in 1921 when it should have\nbeen 1922, he would officially reach\nhis majority a year before his time\nand would vote a year too soon. It\nalso was explained that he would\ncease to be a minor a year too early,\nand that the error might result in a\ngreat deal of trouble in the settle\nment of estates.

The increase\nin good done and the result of this\ngood will lessen care and the sunny\nsmiles will add strength to the giv\ner and the receiver.\nFor Palatka it is decided that the\nduty of every citizen this week is to\ntake the eras toff his frontispiece;\nto \'light it up with a smile; to- look\nfor beaming countenances, and to il\nluminate the sphere of his activities\nwith a smile. If you never . gave\naway anything in your life waste a\nfew smiles this week. Watch the\nnumber you get back.V\n"A little touch of sunshine\nMakes the whole world gr.in."\nMethodists Will\nEnroll Million\nin Tithing Plan\nChicago, 111., Feb. 6. The most\nextensive and thorough-going cam\npaign ever attempted by any re\nligious denomination, in the interest\nof Christian stewardship has just\nbeen launched by the Methodist Epis\ncopal church.\n"Three hundred thousand Ameri\ncan Methodists are now enrolled as\nChristian stewards, men and women\nwho agree to pay a tenth of their in\ncome to Christian work;," declared\nthe Reverend Dr. Luther E. Lovejoy,\nD. D., of Chicago, secretary of the\nstewardship division of the commit\ntee on conservation and advance,\nhere today. "The program just an\nnounced for 1922 by the stewardship\ndivision- however, calls for an imme\ndiate enrollment to the number of\nnot less than a full million of tithing\nstewards, a quarter of the member\nship of the church.\n"The plan is for a great tithing\ndemonstration to be completed on\nEaster Sunday. After a period of\nintensive preparation through Feb\nruary and March every member of\nthe church and Sunday school will\nbe asked to lay aside one-tenth of\nhis or her income, for the week be\ntween Palm Sunday and Easter, and\nbring it to the treasury of the\nchurch on Easter Sunday, as a part\nof the program for that day.\n"Already indications of a church\nwide response are coming in. A lo.\ncomotive engineer, a New York law-\nyer, a shirt manufacturer, a furni\nture dealer, a refrigerator maker\nand a Missouri music man will pre\n,sent a tenth of their profits for the\nweek. A woman in Florida will give\na tenth of her egg money. The treas.\nurer of one of the largest automo.\nbile factories, the manager of a\nchain of ten-cent stores and one of\nthe largest show manufacturers will\nturn, over a tenth of their income.\nPIGGLY-WIGGLY CONCERN\nOPENING MANY BRANCHES\n"Piggly-Wiggly" stores, famous\nthroughout the world, are evidently\nto become\' mroe than hearsay to a\nnumber of Florida people, for "Piggly-Wiggly,"\nwho are soon to open a\nstore in Palatka, will have homes in\nmore than thirty Florida cities be\nfore very long. Piggly-Wiggly has\ndemonstrated what it can do in such\nFlorida towns as Jacksonville, Or\nlando, Tampa and Miami, and the\nbankers and business men who or\nganized the Tri-State Piggly-Wiggly\ncompany, state that with a little co\noperation of Florida families it will\nbe possible to open thier full quota\nof stores very shortly.\nBack in 1916 Piggly-Wiggly start\ned in Memphis, Tenn., and has grown\nbeyond all the wildest dreams of the\nfounder, being indeed a child of\nmuch bilsiijess vtoday. With over\nten billion dollars being spent in this\ncountry each year for groceries- it\nis only reasonable that some im\nprovement in the old style way of\nconducting a grocery store would be\nwelcome.\nA new era in the grocery business\nhas been marked with Piggly-Wig-\ngly\'s debut all over the nation. Just\nthink of two clerks serving from 500\nto 2,000 people a day. The way is\nvery simple for every purchaser be\ncomes his or her own clerk, the\nserve-yourself plan being followed\nout strictly.\nSaving three cents on a pound of\ncoffee does not seem worth while,\nbut on three pounds the housewife\nhas saved almost a dime. And then\nthree cents or more on almost every\nthing the purchaser needs each day\n! i 11 i 11.. 1 ... 1 i\nis aismcuy ro me ouyer s advantage.\nH. E.

The\nAtlantic fleet steamed into Guanta\nnamo bay today and anchored off the\nnaval base that for more than a score\nof yers has been the winter play\nground and training camp for Yan\nkee sailormen. Here the gobs and\ntheir officers will remain until April,\nworking a bit and having the play\nthat keeps Jack a bright and snappy\nboy.\nNone of the sailors had put foot\non land since January 3, when their\nships went to sea for the annual\ncruise in southern waters- until\nlaunches came chugging to shore to\nday. Admiral Hilary P. Jones, com\nmander of the fleet, was waiting\naboard his flagship Columbia in the\nharbor when the fighting craft\nplowed into the bay from the Guan-\ncanayabo gulf,\' 180 miles westward,\nwhere since January 10 everyone\nhas been busy with gunnery exer\ncises, engineering trials and torpedo\nfiring.\nThe commander\'s aim to key up\nevery man to the highest pitch of ef\nficiency and fitness will be carried\nout here by torpedo practice, spot\nting, turret drills and night fire re\nhearsals aboard ship, while on shore\nbaseball and other sports will give\nthe sailors plenty of recreation.\nEvery gob is a man among men\nand men only from now until April,\nThe station embraces 50 square miles\nin the Guantanamo valley along the\nsouthern coast line of Cuba not far\nfrom the eastern tip of the island.\n"A RIDING ROMEO."\nTom Mix is the star of the Fox\npicture, "A Riding Romeo," which\ncomes to the Grand soon.

It was\nbecause of this service that the red\nhat was conferred upon him on June\n16, 1921, when a Similar honor was\nbestowed on Cardial Laurcnti.\nCardinal Ratti was born in Italy\non October 12, 1858. For many\nyears he was librarian of the Am-\nibrosian library and archives at Mi\nlan. Later he became librarian of\nthe Vatican. In this position he re\nmained until the new republic of Po\nland established official diplomatic\nrelations with the Vatican at which\ntime Ratti was appointed archbish\nop and was assigned to Poland as the\nrepresentative of the holy see.\nThat country was then torn with\nthe estrangements from religion\nbrought about by the communistic\npropaganda from soviet Russia and\nArchbishop Ratti counteracted the\nspread of radicalism. He also won\nthe esteem of Polish Catholics by his\nefforts in behalf of destitute chil\ndren orphaned by the war.\nCardinal Ratti as the archbishop\nof Milan presides over one of the\nmost important archdioceses in Italy.\nThe city being a great industrial\ncenter ,one of its main requirements\nis that the cardinal shall possess a\nthorough knowledge of political and\nsocial problems.
