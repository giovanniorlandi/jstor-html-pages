        <pre>['Obituary\nChristopher (Chris) Freeman FRCPsych FRCP (Ed)\nFormerly Consultant Psychotherapist and Consultant\nPsychiatrist, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, and Honorary\nProfessor, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh\nChristopher (Chris) Paul Lindsay Freeman, who recently died at\nthe age of 70, had an unusually bright and enquiring mind and\nloved challenging existing orthodoxies. In 1978, while still a\njunior academic, he carried out a double-blind trial of the\neffectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) — then, as\nnow, a controversial intervention. The trial, which found ‘real’\nECT to be superior to ‘sham’ ECT, was published in The Lancet,\na remarkable achievement for such a young researcher.\nSubsequently, he published a number of other key research\npapers, almost 150 publications in total. He also contributed\nsubstantially to the teaching of a generation of psychiatrists,\npersonally writing chapters on neuroses, personality disorder\nand ECT for the Companion to Psychiatric Studies. In addition, he\nwas co-editor of the 7th and 8th editions of this textbook,\nrequired reading for those studying for the MRCPsych\nqualification.\nDespite his academic productivity, Chris was more interested\nin developing and improving services than in pursuing an\nacademic career. His considerable energies went especially\ninto his areas of expertise: psychotherapy as it relates to eating\ndisorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and ECT. It is an\nindication of his breadth of knowledge that he chose to focus\non opposite ends of the psychiatric treatment spectrum.\nAlthough his influence on psychological therapies in the\ntreatment of eating disorders and trauma-related morbidity\nwas broad, the most tangible evidence of his efforts was the\nestablishment of the Cullen Centre at the Royal Edinburgh\nHospital, the Anorexia Nervosa Intensive Treatment Team\nand the Regional Unit at St John’s Hospital that provide,\nrespectively, out-patient, community-based and in-patient\ntreatment for people with eating disorders.\nWhen he recognised the increasing number of referrals his\nservice was receiving for the assessment and treatment of\ntraumatic stress disorders, Chris took practical steps to meet\nthe changing needs. He ensured that specialist services for\npeople suffering from these disorders were available by\nestablishing the Rivers Centre, together with Claire Fyvie. This\ncentre was named after W. H. R. Rivers, the psychiatrist who\nworked at Craiglockhart Hospital during the First World War,\nand among whose patients were the poets Siegfried Sassoon\nand Wilfred Owen. Chris also undertook much related\nmedico-legal work that ensured the condition was better\nunderstood by the courts and, where appropriate, that sufferers\nwere compensated. He broadened his influence in this field by\nestablishing the Scottish Trauma Advisory Group with direct\nlinks to the Scottish Government. He also served as President\nof the UK Psychological Trauma Society.\nChris had a strong interest in maintaining high standards in\nthe quality of psychiatric care. In Scotland, he established the\nECT Accreditation Service and later chaired a similar body for\nthe Royal College of Psychiatrists. He also chaired the Ethics\nCommittee of the College and most recently was its Clinical\nLead for Quality Improvement.\nAfter a childhood inYork, Chris studiedmedicine at Edinburgh\nUniversity Medical School, from where he graduated in 1971. He\ntrained in psychiatry at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, obtaining the\nMembership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1976. Three\nyears later, he was awarded the Gaskell Gold Medal. He was\nappointed Senior Lecturer at Edinburgh University Medical School\nand Honorary Consultant Psychiatrist at the Royal Edinburgh\nHospital in 1980, but in 1984 surprised many with a move to a\nNational Health Service Consultant post in Psychotherapy.\nExploring new territory in psychotherapy, he changed the focus of\nthe department from traditional psychoanalytically based psychotherapy\nto cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT). He was able,\nwith colleagues, to develop a training course in CBT for doctors,\npsychologists, nurses and other professionals. This grew to\nbecome the South of Scotland CBT course. The emphasis in\ntherapy was on a positive collaboration with the patient, with the\naim of developing the patient’s motivation to change.\nChris’s personality was characterised by his infectious\nenthusiasm, coupled with an eager willingness to take on new\nchallenges. On occasion, his reluctance to turn down opportunities\nresulted in serious overload and a need to ‘wing it’.\nWhen his ‘just in time’ approach became ‘just too late’, colleagues\ncould be left spinning or catching falling plates. This\nsometimes led them to feel frustrated with him, but there was\nnever any lasting animosity.\nAlthough he placed great importance on getting personally\ninvolved with patients, carers and colleagues, he was never\nhappier than when working with his hands in his garden or\nworkshop. He was fascinated by new technology and its\naccompanying gadgets, but also spent a great deal of time and\neffort gathering an extensive collection of old children’s toys.\nCOLUMNS\nObituary\n174\n', 'At an extremely well-attended memorial service for Chris\nheld at the University of Edinburgh, Playfair Library, on\n13 October 2017, colleagues from many different disciplines\npaid tribute to his massive contributions to the field. Chris was\ndevoted to his family. At the service, his wife and two sons\ndescribed his role as a family man whose happiest times in his\nlater years were spent playing with his grandchildren.\nA quotation from John Buchan on the cover of the order of\nservice eloquently summed up his life.\n‘His presence warmed and lit up so big a region of life\nthat in thinking of him one is overwhelmed by the multitude\nof things that he made better by simply existing among them.’\nBorn on 21 April 1947, Chris Freeman died of cancer of the\nprostate at home in East Lothian on 20 August 2017. He is\nsurvived by his wife Katherine, his sons Paul and Robin, and his\ngrandchildren.\nJames Hendry, Tom Brown, and Derek Chiswick\ndoi:10.1192/bjb.2018.18\n© The Authors 2018.
