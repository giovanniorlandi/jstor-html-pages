        <pre>['The South African Code for the Reporting of\nExploration Results, Mineral Resources and\nMineral Reserves (The SAMREC Code)\ncontributes to promoting the minimum\nrequirements of Public Reporting. A\ndeclaration in terms of The SAMREC Code\nrequires the Competent Person (CP) to be\nprepared to defend themselves to their peers.\nThe Code relies on this peer review process\nand is therefore effectively self-policing. The\neffectiveness of this self-policing has been\ndebated since the inception of the Code, and\nalthough it is sometimes seen as ineffective,\nself-regulation is the preferred method to\nmonitor Public Reporting. \nThe Poseidon Nickel bubble of 1970 and\nthe Bre-X scandal of 1997 motivated the\ncreation of international reporting codes,\nwhich provide investors, potential investors,\nand other stakeholders with a sense of\nconfidence in statements made by promoters\nand owners of mineral projects. Consequently,\nthe aim of the SAMREC Code is to maintain the\ntrust of investors and other interested parties\nby promoting high standards of Public\nReporting. The SAMREC Code is meant as a\nminimum reporting standard and advises CPs\nto report ‘too much information rather than too\nlittle’ (Clause 32 of the SAMREC Code).\nOpponents to the monitoring of Public\nReporting practices are of the opinion that the\nCode is presented as a guideline and therefore\nregulating reporting practices is not necessary.\nFurthermore, opponents feel that some\nresponsibility must be placed on the investor\nto be diligent when investing in an exploration\nor mineral company. The author does not\nconcur with the above opinions, as the mineral\nindustry relies on investments to support\nproject development and, furthermore, the\nindustry historically had a tarnished\nreputation. Mark Twain in the 1880s famously\ndefined a mine as ‘a hole in the ground with a\nliar on top’. Events such as the 1970s\nPoseidon Nickel boom-to-bust, Bre-X, and\nEnron highlight unscrupulous or fraudulent\nbehaviour. In South Africa, recent failures\nsuch in coal, platinum, and gold projects and\nother commodities have eroded investor\nconfidence, for example the delisting of\nMiranda Coal and closure of Burnside gold\nmine. In an industry that requires investor\ncapital, often as seed money to fund early\nexploration or development projects, ensuring\ninvestor confidence is paramount. \nPublic companies listed on the\nJohannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) must\nadhere to the ongoing reporting requirements\nin terms of Section 12.11 of the JSE Listing\nRequirements. When a company reports\nGood reporting practices\nby S.M. Rupprecht\nThe SAMREC Code sets out the minimum standard for the Public Reporting\nof Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves.  When\nmaking a declaration the Competent Person (CP) must disclose relevant\ninformation concerning the status and characteristics of a mineral deposit\nthat could materially influence the economic value of the deposit and\npromptly report any material changes. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange\n(JSE) Listing enlists Panel Readers to review all CP Reports and annual\nreports for their compliance with the SAMREC Code and Section 12 of the\nJSE Listing Requirements. \nThe JSE Readers Panel assists in achieving reporting compliance.\nHowever there are still many Public Reports that are not formally\nreviewed. Thus, the SAMREC Code is largely reliant on self-regulation.\nAlthough Clause 11 of the SAMREC Code makes provision for complaints\nmade in respect of Public Reporting, complaints are rarely made. Yet,\nnoncompliant reporting remains an issue within the southern African\nmineral industry. \nThis paper investigates compliance of Public Reports and some of the\ncommon compliance issues currently being experienced. The paper also\ndiscusses methodologies to improve compliance and Public Reporting, such\nas self-regulation, coaching and training, and other means to promote\ngood reporting compliance.\nPublic Reporting, good practice, self-regulation.\n* University of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n© The Southern African Institute of Mining and\nMetallurgy, 2017.

Fortunately, most companies adhere to the\nprinciples and guidelines of the SAMREC Code. In some\ncases, minor oversights may occur but generally companies\nobserve the underlying values of the Code. Regrettably, there\nis a minority of companies that do not understand the\nimportance of good ongoing reporting and fail to adhere to\nindustry best practice. In these cases, Exploration Results,\nMineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves are reported in an\ninappropriate manner, leaving the public uninformed as\nreporting fails to comply with the Code fully, misinterprets\ndata, distorts information, or fails to disclose material\ninformation fully. The mineral industry is a difficult enough\ninvestment without being encumbered by poor disclosure,\nnon-transparency, and poor quality and/or incompetent\nreporting. \nThis paper discusses the issues around compliant Public\nReporting and the SAMREC Code. The paper also discusses\nthe governing principles of the Code, self-regulation and\ncomplaints procedures, and provides examples of\nnoncompliant reporting. Reference is made to the revised\n2016 SAMREC Code and recommendations made going\nforward regarding Public Reporting, self-regulation, and\nteaching and mentoring of industry professionals. \nIn the course of Public Reporting, CPs sometimes overlook\nthe governing principles of the SAMREC Code, i.e.\nTransparency, Materiality, and Competence (Figure 1). \nMateriality signifies that all relevant information should\nbe made available and that reasoned and balanced reporting\nshould be undertaken. One of the main purposes in\ndeveloping the Codes was to ensure that various\nstakeholders, investors, and their professional advisors\nwould be provided with sufficient information for the purpose\nof making a reasoned and balanced decision. Critical to Public\nReporting is the principle that any material aspects for which\nthe presence or absence of comment could affect the public\nperception or value of the mineral occurrence must be\ndisclosed.\nTransparency requires that the CP provide sufficient\ninformation, which is clear and unambiguous, and that the\nCP does not mislead or omit material information. As a rule,\nit is better for the CP to provide too much information rather\nthan too little. Transparent reporting provides the public with\nconfidence. \nCompetency requires that all technical work conducted is\ndone by suitably qualified and experienced persons who are\nsubject to an enforceable professional code of ethics and rules\nof conduct. It is important that the CP is not unduly affected\nby outside influences and remains able to present a fair and\naccurate report. Persons undertaking the role of a CP must be\ncapable of defending their professional opinions and not be\nintimidated by interested parties.\nCPs, executives, and other interested parties of publicly\nlisted companies are reminded that the Code sets out the\nrequired minimum standards for Public Reporting. CPs, as\nauthors, must insist that they provide written approval (JSE\nListing Requirement) of specific documentation that is\nreferred to in a Public Report or statement. The CP must be\nsatisfied as to the form, content, and context in which that\ndocumentation is to be included in a Public Report. As a\nreminder to the reader, the Code (Clause 3) defines Public\nReports as follows:\nPublic Reports are all those reports prepared for the\npurpose of informing investors or potential investors and\ntheir advisers and include but are not limited to companies’\nannual reports, quarterly reports and other reports included\nin JSE circulars, or as required by the Companies Act. The\nCode also applies to the following reports if they have been\nprepared for the purposes described in Clause 3:\nenvironmental statements; information memoranda; expert\nreports; technical papers; website postings; and public\npresentations. And T8 (A)(ii) Announcements by companies\nshould comply with the SAMREC Code, where applicable, and\ninsofar as they relate or refer to a Competent Person’s report\nthey should: (a) Be approved in writing in advance of\npublication by the relevant Competent Person.\nUnfortunately, Clause 3 is often overlooked by\ncompanies. Some Public Reports fail to comply with the above\nclause and a number of public statements fail to gain\napproval from the responsible CP prior to the announcement.\n\x02\n1106 VOLUME 117     \n', 'In the context of complying with the principles of the\nCode, the CP is required to comment on the relevant sections\nof Table 1 of the SAMREC Code. The 2016 SAMREC Code\nintroduces, similar to the 2012 JORC Code, an ‘if not, why\nnot’ approach to the reporting as per Table 1. This\nnecessitates that each item listed in the table be discussed,\nand if not discussed then the CP must explain why it has\nbeen omitted from the documentation. This additional\nrequirement to the Code improves transparency and ensures\nthat the Public Report is clear to the reader (public) and that\nall items have been considered and have been addressed or\nresolved. \nIn terms of Public Reporting, compliance requires reporting in\naccordance with the principles and guidelines of the SAMREC\nCode. The importance of compliance is the underlying\nrequirement to provide the public with confidence. Based on\ndiscussion held within the SAMREC Committee, some mining\nprofessionals believe that the Codes are becoming overly\nonerous, while others believe that CP Reports (CPRs) should\nbe made simpler and easier to complete, advocating the use\nof a ‘short form’ CPR. The author rejects the above premise\nand stresses the need for comprehensive and fully disclosed\nPublic Reporting. CPRs and other Public Reports, including\nnews releases, should not be taken lightly, noting that Public\nReports must ensure that information provided is\nunambiguous and provide sufficient information for a\nreasonable person to make an informed decision on the\nviability of a project and whether to invest or disinvest. A\nshort form report, basically equivalent to an executive\nsummary, is incapable of providing sufficient detail to\nsufficiently inform an investor.\nOne cannot discuss compliance with the SAMREC Code\nwithout discussing competency of the CP. The glossary of\nterms as provided in the SAMREC Code has no definition\nprovided for competency, yet competency is one of the\nfundamental components of the Code. Competency, as\ndescribed in Clause 4 of the SAMREC Code, is as follows: \n‘The Public Report is based on work that is the\nresponsibility of suitably qualified and experienced persons\nwho are subject to an enforceable Professional Code of\nEthics’. \nAlthough Clause 9 of the Code does provide clarity on the\ndefinition of a CP it relies on the individual to act\ncompetently. \n‘A Competent Person is a person who is registered with\nSACNASP, ECSA or SAGC, IMSSA, or is a Member or Fellow\nof the SAIMM, the GSSA or a RPO’. ‘A Competent Person\nmust have a minimum of five years’ experience relevant to\nthe style of mineralisation and type of deposit or class of\ndeposit under consideration and to the activity he or she is\nundertaking’. \nFor a number of years the JSE has been requesting a\nregistration list for CPs. The reasoning behind this drive is to\nimprove the quality of Public Reporting, the objective being\nthat only persons that have demonstrated their ‘competency’\nwould be able to provide CPRs to the JSE. To date this\nregistration has not materialized, as many CPs believe that\nthere is sufficient regulation or guidelines in place to ensure\ncompetence – the real issue is non-compliance in reporting\nand the lack of discipline for poor reporting practices. Selfregulation\nis seen as the preferred method of control, but it\nrequires peers to monitor CPs’ work and to report\nnoncompliance. \nSome professionals believe that the onus on competency\nshould lie with statutory registration bodies such as\nSACNASP, SAGC, IMSSA, or ECSA. The issue of competency\nis sometimes confused with the fact that a CP must be a\nmember of ECSA, SACNASP, SAGC, IMSSA, or\nmember/fellow of the SAIMM, GSSA or a recognized\nprofessional organization (RPO), all of which have\nenforceable disciplinary processes including the power to\nsuspend or expel a member/fellow. This is important in that\nthese professional organizations provide an enforceable\nProfessional Code of Ethics, which is a basic requirement for\na CP. Although these organizations have disciplinary powers,\nthey in themselves do not determine whether a person is\ncompetent. The responsibility of deeming oneself as\ncompetent relies on the individual as the ‘Competent Person\nshould be clearly satisfied in their own mind that they could\nface their peers and demonstrate competence in the\ncommodity, type of deposit and situation under\nconsideration’ (SAMREC Code, Clause 10).\nIt is up to a CP’s peers to ensure that indeed authors of\ntechnical (Public) reports act in a competent, responsible, and\nethical manner. The CP must demonstrate their own\ncompetency applying to a Code of Ethics and if in doubt a\nperson should either seek the opinion from appropriately\nexperienced peers or should decline to act as a CP for that\nspecific job. \nThe role of the JSE Reader is to ensure that a CPR or annual\nreport is conducted in accordance with the requirements of\nthe SAMREC and SAMVAL Codes, and the JSE Listing\nRequirements, indicate errors in the text, and indicate\nwhether plans and diagrams accompanying the Public Report\nsupport the content of the report. The JSE Reader must be\nsatisfied that the Competent Person or Competent Valuator\ncomplies with the professional registration requirements and\nexperience as set out in Clause 7 to 10 of the SAMREC Code\nand/or Clause 9 and 10 of the SAMVAL Code.\nThe JSE Reader also must ensure that the Competent\nPerson/Competent Valuator, in terms of a CPR, has correctly\nreferenced the SAMREC and SAMVAL Code (Table 1) or JSE\nListing Requirements in the CPR or annual report. \nThe Reader’s job is not to provide sign-off on the\ntechnical aspects of the work nor validate the conclusions of\nthe CPR. It must be acknowledged that there is an element of\npeer review in the process of ensuring that technical work\nmakes sense and is fair and reasonable. For example, the JSE\nReaders guidelines state that ‘the Reader should comment on\nissues which, based on his/her experience appear technically\nincorrect or inadequately covered’. However, in the end the\nCPR remains the responsibility of the author(s).\nThe JSE Readers Panel review process is viewed by other\ncountries as a good process. However, JSE Readers Panel\nreviews are only activated in certain situations and not all\nGood reporting practices\n1107VOLUME 117                                       \x02\n', 'published CPRs are reviewed, especially those conducted for\ncompanies not publicly listed. The reader must understand\nthat many CPRs have not been formally reviewed.\nFurthermore, the JSE Readers review process is not\nwithout its problems. One of the dilemmas with the Readers\nreview process is that a CPR encapsulates a number of areas\nthat may stretch the capabilities of a single Reader. For\nexample, the Reader may be required to be knowledgeable in\nmineral resources, geotechnical engineering, mine\nengineering, ventilation, metallurgical processes,\nenvironmental, infrastructural, marketing, governmental and\nsocial aspects, as well as the valuation of mineral projects. It\nmay be prudent for the JSE to introduce more than one reader\nto conduct reviews of CPRs, thereby improving the overall\nreview process. However, it must be recognized that\nultimately the CPR remains the responsibility of the CP(s). \nAs of 2014, the JSE Readers Panel has also begun to\nreview annual reports of mineral and exploration companies\nto ensure compliance with the ongoing reporting\nrequirements in terms of Section 12.11 of the JSE Listing\nRequirements. The second year of reviewing annual reports\nhas generally seen an improvement in compliance with the\nJSE Listing Requirements [SAMREC Code], however,\ncompliance still can improve.\nProfessionals when coming across noncompliant Public\nReports need to consider if the breach warrants action. The\nSAMREC Code provides a means to make formal complaints,\nand Clause 11 states ‘complaints in respect of the Public\nReport of a Competent Person will be subject to the\ncomplaints procedures of the [The SAMCODE Standards\nCommittee] SSC.’\nThe written complaint will be referred to the Complaints\nSub-committee, which will review the complaint with the\ncomplainant so as to best define the nature of the alleged\nbreach; identify the correct professional/statutory/certifying\norganization where the complaint needs to be lodged; and\nassist the complainant to lodge their grievance in the\nprescribed manner of the applicable organization. The\nrelevant body may be any of the following: SACNASP, ECSA,\nPLATO (now the South African Geomatics Council (SAGC),\nthe Institute of Mine Surveyors of South Africa (IMSSA),\nGSSA, SAIMM, or other Recognized Professional\nOrganization (RPO) to which the CP or Competent Valuator is\naffiliated (Learned Society or Statutory Body).\nThe Complaints Sub-committee will also be available to\nassist the ethics/disciplinary committee of the\nprofessional/statutory/certifying organization in\nunderstanding and/or investigating the nature of the alleged\nSAMCODES-related violation, if requested to do so by that\norganization.\nThe difficulty in managing the quality of Public Reports\nhas been the reluctance of mining professionals to regulate\ntheir peers and to ensure that Public Reports properly adhere\nto the Code. The number of noncompliant Public Reports\nobserved by the author indicates that there are members of\nthe mineral industry that are not concerned with compliance.\nPerhaps this is due the fact that over the past 15 years there\nhave only been a few complaints made to the SSC and\ntherefore there is an attitude that little, if any action is taken\nfor noncompliant reporting. Based on the author’s\nexperience, it appears that there are a few CPs, mining\nexecutives, and senior managers that project a laissez faire\nattitude toward Public Reporting and that for some there is a\nresistance to change reporting practices. A general review of\nexploration and mining company’s web sites will support the\nabove statement. Although the author could reference several\nindiscretions, it is not the intention of this paper to\nembarrass individuals or companies but rather highlight the\nissue.\nThe need for self-regulation and action on noncompliant\nreporting has been an issue and a matter for debate since the\ninception of the SAMREC Code. There are many reasons for a\ngeneral lack of discipline in the industry, one being that CPRs\nare often under confidentiality agreements. Another is the\nreluctance of practising CPs to make formal complaints\nagainst peers – justifying the lack of criticism under the\nproverb ‘persons who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw\nstones’. \nNon-compliance in reporting is not limited to South\nAfrica but is a problem for all reporting countries. A general\nconsensus is that more focus should be on coaching and\nmentoring of CPs. Rather than viewing complaints as a\nprocess of taking disciplinary action or sanctions against CPs,\nthere should be a move towards coaching and mentoring. It\nis proposed that the SSC, through each of the Code\nCommittees, form a subcommittee whose primary objective is\nto promote short courses through the GSSA and/or SAIMM to\nimprove knowledge of the Code and its reporting\nrequirements. \nSimilarly, it may be prudent for the learned societies to\npublish (anonymously) corrective actions taken for\nnoncompliant reporting. The AusIMM successfully does this\nand the author believes that this approach should be adopted\nin South Africa. It is interesting to note that if noncompliance\nis established, the AusIMM may impose a penalty, which\nmay include a reprimand, mediation, and/or counselling.\nHowever, suspension of membership to the AusIMM is not\nimposed by the Complaints Committee, as may be the case\nwith some of the South African professional/statutory bodies. \nThe Canadian Ontario Securities Commission in 2013\nundertook a compliance review of 50 Technical Reports that\nrepresented approximately 10% of the NI43-101 Technical\nReports submitted over the period 30 June 2011 to 30 June\n2012 (Ontario Securities Commission, 2013). The review\nfound that 40% of the CPRs required significant changes and\na further 40% were also noncompliant, requiring minor\nchanges. Only 20% of the reports were considered compliant. \nIt should be noted that professional organizations do not\ntake legal responsibility for a CP or a CPR. Professional\nmembership does not guarantee competency for any specific\ntechnical report, nor do qualifications necessarily guarantee\ncompetency. The onus of conducting competent technical\nwork remains with the CP. Professional organizations are\nlegally liable for ensuring that a person who applies for and\nis accepted for membership satisfies the requirements of the\norganization’s constitution and by-laws. In doing so the\nGood reporting practices\n\x02\n1108 VOLUME 117     \n', 'professional organization affirms that the individual satisfies\nthe requirements for, and has the qualifications required to\nbe, a member and ensures that the member complies with the\ncode of ethics of the organization. These organizations have\nno liability for the negligent activities of their members. This\nis one of the reasons for not having a register of CPs, as the\nholders of the list could be held liable if a CP does not\nconduct compliant work. \nOne thing is for certain – if the mineral industry does not\nself-regulate its reporting then some other agency will and\nthat could lead to non-mineral experts reviewing technical\nreports; an outcome that will not be good for the mining\nindustry as a whole.\nThe following section highlights some of the more common\nor serious mistakes in reporting.\nFigure 2 depicts a public Coal Resource and Reserve\nstatement, which provides an example of a number of\ncommon compliance issues observed by the author. Although\nthis statement is dated 2013, the issues highlighted remain\nrelevant. The author has removed the project names as not to\nembarrass the company or the CP purposely. \nThe Coal Reserve is not subdivided in order of increasing\nconfidence into Probable and Proved Reserves. Clauses 32,\n33, and 34 of the Code highlight the requirements when\nreporting reserves. Although not the case in this example,\nCPs continue to incorrectly use the term ’Proven’ instead of\n’Proved’. Furthermore, when reporting Coal Reserves,\nMineable Tons In-situ (MTIS), ROM, and Saleable Tonnages\nmust be reported. In the above example the Saleable Tonnage\nhas been left out of the report, and therefore the reader is\nuninformed of the coal beneficiation efficiency and the\nplanned market for the sale of the washed coal.\nFigure 2 highlights another common occurrence in the\ndeclaration of Coal Resources and Reserves – the failure to\nreport the quality of the coal. The above example only reports\ncoal tonnages. According to Clause 52 of the Code,\nappropriate coal qualities must be reported for all Resources\nand Reserve categories. The selection of the quality\nparameters is the responsibility of the CP and should include\nparameters such as ash, volatile matter, sulphur, coking\nproperties, calorific value, etc. The coal quality parameters\nalso should include the basis of reporting (air-dry or dry\nbasis, etc.), and where applicable Saleable Coal Reserves\nshould be subdivided into the relevant coal product types. \nThis information is critical and without reporting coal\nqualities the Coal Reserve is almost useless to an investor.\nThis reporting trend must be stopped immediately;\nunfortunately, many coal companies observe this trend as\nbeing sanctioned. Hopefully, through the JSE Readers Panel’s\nreview of annual reports and ongoing training this poor\nreporting practice will be corrected over the next couple of\nyears. \nWhen reporting Exploration or Reconnaissance Results\n(Clause 20 of the SAMREC Code) the potential quantity,\nquality, and content should be reported as a range and\nshould include a detailed explanation of the basis for the\nstatement and a proximate statement that the potential\nquantity, quality, and content are conceptual in nature.\nFailure to report as a range of values and not providing a\ndetailed explanation may be misleading to the investor, as it\nmay appear that there is greater confidence associated with\nthe project than actually exists. Failure to comply with Clause\n20, as seen in the provided example, remains a common\noversight by some CPs and Public Reports.\nWhen both Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are\nreported the Public Report must include a statement that\nclearly indicates whether the Mineral Resource is inclusive of,\nor exclusive to those Mineral Resources that have been\nmodified to estimate a Mineral Reserve (Clause 39). The\ndebate on whether Mineral Resources should be reported\ninclusive or exclusive of the Mineral Reserve is a decade-long\ndebate that probably will never be resolved. However,\nwhatever the reporting position, a statement is required to\navoid confusion and the possibility of the inaccurate\nvaluation of the Mineral Resources. The above example, like\nmany other Resource–Reserve statements, fails to disclose\nwhether the Coal Resources are inclusive or exclusive of the\nCoal Reserve. \nGood reporting practices\nVOLUME 117                                       1109 \x02\n', 'Good reporting practices\nAlthough Figure 2 is only a summary of the Coal Resource\nand Coal Reserve, the CP’s report also failed to provide\ncommentary on the reasonableness of the projects. For\nexample, on the only operating mine, no comment is provided\nwhether a Life Of Mine (LOM) plan has been completed or\nany other commentary to support the declaration of a Coal\nReserve. For other projects with Coal Reserves, no mention is\nmade if a Feasibility Study or Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) has\nbeen conducted – a requirement in order to declare a Reserve. \nThe Public Reporting of a Mineral Resource estimate must\nprovide sufficient information on how the projects have\nreasonable prospects for economic extraction, assumptions\nmade to estimate economic viability, and the cut-off grade\nused to estimate the Mineral Resource. \nIn the above example more than two of the project areas\ndeclared a reserve; however the CP declared ’The [deleted]\npillar project is still in a planning phase’. In order to declare a\nReserve the company should have either conducted a PFS or\na LOM Plan. This was not the case at the time of the\ndeclaration, and therefore the project should only be\nclassified as a Coal Resource as per Clauses 33 and 34 of\nSAMREC Code read with Clauses 47 and 48.\nA Mineral Reserve must be based on a minimum\nassessment of a PFS for a project or a LOM Plan for an\noperation, and the modifying factors applied must be\nrealistically considered (Clause 32). On occasion, Mineral\nReserves are declared without a PFS being completed, which\ncan have a material effect on the project’s valuation. In terms\nof compliance, this is one of the biggest mistakes a CP can\nmake. \nMineral/exploration companies are required to disclose the\nfull name, address, professional qualifications, and relevant\nexperience of the Lead CP authorizing publication of the\ninformation disclosed. Informing the investor of the CP’s\ndetails and experience is also important to provide the\ninvestor with confidence that the CP is competent. For the\ninformed investor, knowledge of the responsible CP may\ninfluence the decision to invest or not to invest in a project.\nIt is common for exploration/mineral companies not to\ninclude a statement that they have written confirmation from\nthe Lead CP that the information disclosed is in accordance\nwith the SAMREC Code and, where applicable, the JSE Listing\nRequirements. Again, it is hoped this poor habit will be\nrectified in the short to medium term.\nMany Public Reports fail to comment on whether the Inferred\nMineral Resource category has been included in Feasibility\nStudies, and if so, the impact of such inclusion. The use of\nlarge portions of Inferred Resources in a PFS is also incorrect,\nand can falsely elevate the value of a mineral project. \nThe terms ‘ore’ or ‘orebody’ should be used only when a\nMineral Reserve has been completed, and should be\nassociated with Mineral Reserves and not Mineral Resources.\nFor example, the following excerpt from a recent news release\nis incorrect.\nThe Zone 5 resource (JORC 2012 compliant) now totals\nan estimated 100.3 million tonnes of measured, indicated,\nand inferred ore grading 1.95% copper and 20 grams per\ntonne silver.\nA common reporting mistake is the use of ‘calculated’ instead\nof ’estimated’ when referring to Mineral Resource and\nMineral Reserve statements.\nThe Code requires that a comparison of the Mineral Resource\nand Mineral Reserve estimates with the previous financial\nyear/period’s estimates is provided and an explanation\nprovided of the material differences between the two\ndeclarations. This remains a common oversight by CPs.\nPublic Reports often provide no description of future\nexploration activities, exploration expenditures, exploration\nresults, and feasibility studies undertaken. Directors are\nrequired to state (or include an appropriate negative\nstatement) on any legal proceedings or other material\nconditions that may impact on the company’s ability to\ncontinue mining or exploration activities. Again, this\nstatement is often overlooked in Public Reporting.\nOptimistic assumptions in terms of mining rates, capital\nexpenditure, operating costs, and revenue factors are\nrequired. Problems encountered in technical reports include\nthe inadequate disclose of the main components of the capital\ncost estimate. Also, economic analysis information such as\ncash flows and or sensitivity analysis is sometimes omitted or\nlacks detail. Many of the reports do not clearly disclose the\nassumed metal price or factors related to the mining scenario\nor mineral processing recovery. Failure to provide this type of\ninformation prevents the public from conducting their own\ntechno-economic analysis of the project.\nWhen reading an annual report, often one will come across\nthe following or a similar statement - ‘A resources and\nreserves summary, which is SAMREC compliant and JSE\napproved, is carried in full on the [deleted] website.’ The\nannual report must contain the full information, as required\nby Section 12.11, within the annual report itself. Reference to\nother documentation providing further detailed information\nfor the public is fine, but should not be used to provide\nprimary information to the public.\nThe identification of risk is mentioned in several areas of the\n\x02\n1110 VOLUME 117     \n', 'Code, with a dedicated section (T6) in Table 1. Although CPs\nmay comment on risk, seldom is the analysis conducted with\nthe intent of truly identifying risk in the Mineral Resource\nand Mineral Reserve estimation. A risk assessment should\nincorporate all technical specialists involved in the Mineral\nResource and Mineral Reserve estimation process. For\nexample, Public Reports fail to disclose project-specific risks\nand uncertainties, such as the availability of infrastructure,\ngovernment approvals, use of novel mining/mineral\nprocessing technology, or the potential impact of regional\nunrest or civil war, e.g. Central Africa. Environmental and\nsocial issues have become increasingly important in recent\nyears and remain an area of poor commentary. Based on the\nguiding principles of the Code, environmental and social\nissues require appropriate commentary in Public Reports.\nA general consensus is that more focus should be on\ncoaching and mentoring of CPs in order to improve reporting\ncompliance. Coaching and mentoring should be seen as the\npreferred method, rather than using disciplinary action or\nsanctions against CPs. Ongoing training for CPs and CVs\nneeds to be actively pursued by professional organizations,\nwith the price of such training kept to a minimum so that\ncosts do not become prohibitive. \nSome universities, such as the University of\nJohannesburg, include tuition in the area of the SAMREC and\nSAMVAL Codes. The Geological Society of South Africa\n(GSSA) conducts CPs courses once or twice a year. The JSE\nalso has in the past provided reporting compliance courses\nand the SAIMM provides ad hoc presentations on the varied\ntopics on the codes: recent examples include un update of the\n2016 SAMREC and SAMVAL Codes, the application of\nModifying Factors, and the Companion Volume published to\ncoincide with the launch of the 2016 SAMREC and SAMVAL\nCodes.\nAs peers we must play a more active role in regulating\nour own industry. As a general observation, the mining\nindustry needs to implement a coaching and mentoring\napproach, thereby uplifting reporting standards. Coaching\nand mentoring must not be limited to only CPs, but must also\nextended to exploration and mineral companies who must\nalso abide by the SAMREC Code as well as the JSE Listing\nRequirements \nThe SAMREC Code already provides guidelines to reporting,\nas presented in Table 1. The difficulty is that Table 1 is not\nproperly used, as authors of CPRs fail to comply fully with\nthe provided checklist, choosing rather to omit certain clauses\nof the Code. The updating of the Code should improve\ncompliance with the introduction of the ‘if not, why not’\napproach to reporting. \nHowever, updating of the Code addresses only one aspect\nof Public Reporting compliance. The implementation of selfregulation\nand peer review will go a long way towards\nimproving reporting compliance. CPs, as well as the mining\nindustry, must realize that failure to comply with the guiding\nprinciples of the SAMREC Code not only damages the\nreputation of the CP but also the reputation of the mining\nprofession. The mineral industry must self-regulate,\notherwise others will conduct this regulatory process and\nalmost certainly this will not be to the industry’s liking or\nsatisfaction. \nAlong with self-regulation, more teaching and mentoring\nis required to improve the overall quality of Public Reporting.\nA number of companies and organizations conduct training\ncourses on a regular basis; some for commercial purposes\nwhile other learned societies such the GSSA and SAIMM\npresent courses on a non-profit basis. In the future, courses\nneed to focus on compliance issues, the underlying meaning\nand intent of the Code, and examples of good and poor\nreporting practices.\nWhen CPs fail to comply with the Code and a complaint is\nraised, corrective action must be taken. The process should\nfocus on corrective action rather than punishment. The\nprocess should be geared to improve reporting standards,\nwith severe retribution served only to those individuals\nacting in a fraudulent or incompetent manner. Part of the\nprocess must involve educating the mining fraternity on the\nshortcomings in Public Reporting practices so that\ndeficiencies can be shared and the lessons learned made\npublic.\nAny learning outcome must provide a foundation to the\nintent of the Code. Currently, CPs see the Code as a hurdle to\nbe met in order to complete an assignment. All too often\nthere appears to be a disjoint between creating a report and\nprotecting the interests of investors. Furthermore, CPs must\nbe capable of preserving their professional opinions and not\nbe intimidated by interested parties.\nThe author would like to acknowledge the assistance and\nguidance provided by Mr Ken Lomberg of Pivot Mining\nConsultants (Pty) Ltd. \nONTARIO SECURITIES COMMISSION. 2013.
