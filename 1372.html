Mary s and it is\ncruel to play upon their fears and\nendeavor to create the belief that\ntheir liberties or property rights are\nendangered by Democratic success.\nBecause an element of witless and\nimpudent young negroes and negres\nses, on every available occasion,\nsay or do something to arouse the (\npassions and prejudices of white\npeople who take an active part in\nDemocratic politics, is little excuse\nfor violent talk or for cherishing an j\nimosity against the large element of\nolder and better colored men and\nwomen of the county. Lettho white\npeople exercise forbearance and en\ndeavor to allay unreasonable fears\non the part of our colored imputa\ntion. and trust to time to set aright\nthe political questions that were in\nvolved in the contest just ended,\nand to so amend the election law as\nto prevent a revival of the race issue\nin Maryland politics.\nThe Elections.\nElections were held Tuesday last\nin eleven Stales. The results may\nbo summarized as follows:\nDemocratic.\nMcClellan, democrat, defeated\nLow, fusion-republican by a plura\nlity of til ,872.\nGarvin, democrat wasulected Gov\nemor of Rhode Island by about 1000\nplurality.\nVardanian, democrat, had no op\nposition for Governor in M ississippi,\nBockham, democrat, is elected\ngovernor in Kentucky by a plura\nof lity 15.000.\nRepublican.\nRepublican Governors were elec\nt.*d in Ohio, Massachusetts, and\nlowa.\nPennsylvania elected Snyder, re\npublican, auditor, by the usual heavy\nmajority.\nIn Colorado a Republican Judge of\nthe Stale Supremo Court was elec\nted.\nDoubtful.\nThe election in Nebraska for Judge\nof the Supreme Court of the State i s 1\nin doubt.\nLate returns indicate that the Re i\npublicans have a small majority in !\nCharles county, and thaf. Brook I\nMatthews, democrat, is probably i\nelected Register of Wills. I\n* \'~"L _ . ——__\nOur Washington Letter.\nNovbmbee 2, 1903.\nThe Roosevelt administration has\nbecome vociferously notorious for\nthe gigantic and unheard of frauds\nthat have been perpetrated since its\nadvent to power, and also for the\nslight efforts made to expose them\nand punish the offenders. A few of\nthe smaller fry in the Postoffice scan\ndal have been indicted and few have\nbeen tried, but not convicted, as the\nevidence adduced by the govern\nment attorneys was not sufficient to\nconvince a jury of their guilt. The\ndelay in investigating these scan\ndals has been a boon to most of the\ngreater offenders, for that conve\nnient law, the statute of limits\ntions, has run its course and the\ntime has expired in which they could\nbe indicted. That the statute of lim\nStations, covers a number of these\nquestions is denied by eminent law\nyers, but the Republican Attorney\nGeneral has decided that itdoes, and\nthere is no way of bringing the cul\nprits to trial, if the law officer of the\ngovernment refuses to act. As hith\nerto mentioned in this correspon\ndence, one of the principal partiei\npants in the leniency of this accom\nmodating statute is Hepreseuative\nLitiauer, who, President Roosevelt\ndescribed\'as “his personal friend and\nclosest )>olitical advisor.” Litiauer\nwas charged with sharing in the\nprofits of a largo army glove con\ntract, and dial he hud used his posi\ntion as a member of Congress to ob\ntain the contract, notwithstanding\nthe provisions of the law that no of\nficial should be interested in any\nsuch deal. When referred to the\nRepublican Attorney General, he\npromptly decided that Mr. Litiauer\ncould not bo prosecuted, us the stat\nute of limitations had runitseourse,\nso the "closest political advisor" of\n1 the President escaped the huinilia\ntion of a trial and possible cun vie\ntlon. Fraud and graft is getting\nmighty close to the White House\nwhen the statute of limitations has\nto l>o pleaded for the "personal\nfriend" of the present occupant.\nThe I’ostoffice frauds arc not the\nonly ones that are causing sleepless\nnights an<l l>ail lialf hours to many\nliolltical put riots. Evidence is ac\n| cumulating that huge frauds amount\nj lug in value to #4(l.(MHl.inKl have been\n| discovered and that six United\nStates Senators, several ItopresMi\ntailves and numerous government\nOfficials are mentioned in oonnuctiou\nj with the frauds, though Secretary\n! Hitchcock, of the Interior Depart\ninenti is continuously entsrring stren\nuous denials. The frauds in eonnee\nlion with the Indian lands now\' be\ning investigated, has only just be\ngun, and rumors of other frauds in\nother departments are tilling the air\nat Washington This delay in ex*\nissuing what has already been dis\ncovered may, as the UusUifficc scan\ndal, be made for the purpose of al\nlowing the statute of limitations to\nget in its work and (s-rmit other lie\npublican patriots to escape the toils\nof the taw,\n• •I\nA little thing that is causing much\ncomment here is the attempt of the\nPresident, through his Secretary,\nMr. 1/mh, to ape the airs of the for\neign courts. He is having his White\nHouse messengers clothed in uni\nform, and the report is that the ush\ners and doorkeepers at the execu\ntive offices will be the next to don\nthe uniform prescribed by Secretary\nUicli, with ibo tacit approval of\nPresident Roosevelt. As they out\nrank the messenger, the uniform is\nto be cut in more fashionable style,\nand the other officials of the White\nHouse are to be more brilliantly at\ntired so that the social function will\nmatch the gorgeousness of any for\neign court. The White House will\nbe made to blaze with all the glory\nand frippery and tinsel and gaudy\ndisplay of the Hun kies of European\neffete monarchies. These beßeput)\nlican times surely, and the people\nfisit the bill.\nThe Republican organs of the\ncountry have been boating the tom\ntoms and sounding the hewgags\nabout “our matchless diplomacy”\nthat, succeeded in obtaining from\nChina two “open ports” in Man\nchuria. One of these “ports" is\nnamed in the treaty as Mukden, and\nprobably the people of the United\nStates would have gone on believing\nthat our increasing trade was flow\ning through that open door if Russia\nhad not objected to our having any\nthing lo do with that country. Our\nNavy Department thereupon decided\nthat in the event of trouble between\nRussia and Japan, the Asiatic squad\nron under Admiral Evans should be\ndivided and ordered to each of the\n“treaty ports.” This decision of\nour Naval Board of Strategy fired\nthe hearts of all our old salts who\ngather at the Army and Navy Club,\nand they were anxious for a scrap\nwith anyone. A young clerk at the\nNavy Department, however, has up\nset the plans of these warriors in\nbuckram by reading a book just pub\nlished by an American traveler\nnamed Shoemaker, who describes\nhis journey from Moscow to Port\nArthur, in which he tells that Muk\nden is an interior city three hun\ndred miles north of Port Arthur,\nThe explosion in diplomatic and na\nval circles that folio wed this dis\ncovery can be more easily imagined\nthan described. The demand for\nstimulants at the Club, where the\nBoard of Strategy bolds Its sessions,\nbeat all previous records, and the Pre\nsident and John Hay wercnonplus\nsed. The State Department having\nsolemnly, by treaty, declared Muk\nden a ‘port,’ persist inthat declara\ntion, but our naval heroes think it\nimpossible to carry cut the plansof the\nBoard of Strategy, there being not\nenough water to float a canoe, much\nlessabattleship, within miles of"thu\nport.” The Chinese have fooled\nourStatc Department, probablyatthe\ninsitgation of Russia, and \'the open\ndoor\'to Manchuria is stillshutso fur\nas the sea is concerned, and our\n‘malchlessd iplomacy ’\' has received a\ncheck that the present administra\ntion will never be able to overcome.\nThe report \'of Fourth Assistant\nPostmaster General Hrisfow on the\nPost Office frauds has been placed in\nthe hands of the President, consist\ning of over one hundred and ten\nthousand words with aptHUidieos\nsufficient to make nearly one million\nwords. It is said that only a con\ndensed verison will be published.\nIf the parts that will be given hi the\npublic contain the real meal, of the\nvoluminous report, the condensation\nwill be desirable, as but few people\nhave time to read the whole report,\nfmt there will bo intense dissalis\nfaction if the public version is garb\nled for partisan purposes. The vo\nters want to know whoure the guilty\nones, whether the statute of limita\ntions has covered their doings or not,\n| and nothing less than the exposure\nof the whole nest of thieves will sat\nj isfy them. The only punishment\n: the. people seem able to bring upon\ntheir unworthy servants, is by pre\nventing them from again occupying\nofficial (tosiiioe--, and that tan only\nbe accomplished by the truth being\ni told of ail connected with the scan\ni tlais from the highest to the lowest.\nAny attempt to suppress the evi\ndeuce of the participation of those,\nhigh in the liepublieun counsels in\nthe frauds, will not satisfy those\nhonestly in favor of reform, and will\nbe met by the demand for the pub\nUcalion of the whole report, oust\nwhat it may. The partisan Repub\nlican press will report but Utile of\nthe, damaging details of the con nee\ntion of its own officials of the high\nest class with the scandals, but the\nfacts will be culled by the newspa\nport* that serve tint people if they\nare allowed access to the truth.\n1 1 must Isi remembered that the\nex pmrues of the l*ost Office frauds\nhave been wriinglrom the tin willing\nRepublican leaders by the force of\npublic opinion, and not Itccaune they\nwere anxious to expose the scon ml.\nrets. Postmaster General Bayne,\nwhen his department was first un\nder suspicion, designated the first\nexposure of the frauds as "hot air," j\nand belittled the whole matter asfar\nas ho was able, but the rival factions\nin the Bust Office I)e|iartment were\ntoo intent on destroying each other, !\nto permit the euidence of the frauds ;\nto be kept secret, and the investiga\ntion had to proceed: If the making\nof a synopsis of the report of Mr.\nBristow is toft to Mr, l*ayne, or any ,\nof bis satellites, but little ov identic !\ndamaging to the higher ufliciuls will\nover be seen by the public eye. The\nDemocrats in Congress willot con so\ndemand that the w hole evidence be I\nprinted, bul the minority parly has\nbut little show to force such action,\nunless the public vigorously de\nmands it.\nC’iiari.kh A.

Lawrence,\nLEONARDTOWN, MD.\nDeo 4t •', 'Saint Male’s Beacon\nA Proti table Business.\nCharlevoix, Mich., is a summer\nresort bad way up Lake Michigan,\nand with its hotels, cottages and\nsplendid fishing, is a delightful place\nto spend a vacation. Heavy, fra\ngrant timber in many varieties sur\nrounds the place, Jwith squirrel’s,\nblack, gray and red, almost as plen\nty as leaves upon the tree.s\nA year or two ago, I had finished\na week at Charlevoix, was waiting\nat the depot for the train for Petos\nkey and Harbor Springs, to close\nout the month. There were a num\nber of people, ladies and gentlemen,\nalso waiting the arrival of the train\nwhen a small boy put in on appear\nance, carrying a gray squirrel with\na string tied to one leg. Several\nladies at once became interested, and\nas the lad said bo had justcaught it,\nthey urged him to ’ let the poor\nthing go.” The boy only grinned,\nuntil one said: “See here, boy, I’ll\ngive you 25 cents to let the dear lit\ntle fellow have his liberty.” Said\nhe; ‘Til do it!” The money was\npaid, the string iosened, and away\nho ran, likeagray streak, to the close\nby rail fence. The boy disappeared\nalso.\nSoon another bus load came to the\nstation, and in a few minutes again\nthere came it boy with a gray squir\nrel, st ring tied, as before, toone leg;\n* the boy wore a different cap and\njacket, but 1 thought it looked like\nthe same boy. Again a soft hearted\nlady tough I the squirrel’s release,\nfor another quarter. Thu station\nagent laughed, i asked him what\nwas the matter.\n“Nothing much. Say, that boy is\na smart one; makes lots of money\nselling his tame squirrel to these\ntender hearted women.”\n“Well, why don’t you tell them\nwhat be is doing?”\n“Oh, f don’t like fo mix up in oth\ner people\'s affairs.

But, alas, his\nsearch was in vain!\nStill it is difficult to disappoint a\nclever young man when he has set\nhis mind on to getting something.\nAn idea occurred to him, and, as\nsuming an official air, he stalked up\nto the last carriage and cried in a\nstentorian voice:\n“All change here! This carriage\nisn’t going:\nThere were exclamations low, but\ndeep, from the occupants of the\ncrowded compartments, but never\ntheless they scurried out of the car\nriage and packed themselves away in\nother parts of the train.\nThe smile on the face of the\nyoung man was childlike end bland\nas he settled himself spaciously in\na corner of lbs empty carriage and\nlit a cigar.\n“Ah,” he murmured, “it’s a grand\nthing for me that I waa born clev\ner! 1 wish they’d hurry up and\nstart.”\nPresently the station master put\nhis head in the window and said:\n“I s’pose you’re the smart young\nfellow who told the people tins car\nriage wasn’t going.”\n“Yes,” said the clever one. And\nhe smiled.\n“Well,” said the station master,\nwith a grin, “it isn’t. The porter\nheard you telling the people, and so\nhe uncoupled it. lie thought you\nwere a director.” —Stray Stories.\nThe Small Boy Become* Thoughtful.\nTommy (at the barn)—Papa, is\nthis fhe finest team in town?\nTommy’s Father —No; but there\nisn’t any finer.

They’re a per\nfect match, high spirited, good trav\nelers and come of a famous ances\ntry.\n“That’s why you\'ve got such a\nnice barn for ’em, isn’t it ?"\n“Yes, partly, A pair of fine\nhorses, iny boy, muat he considered\nas an investment, and a good Into\nness man always takes care of his\ninvestments.”\n“And that\'s why you watch ’em so\nmuch and drive on the boulevards\nwith ’em and keep ’em looking so\nslick, isn’t it?”\n“Yes, that’* on the same princi\nple. A careful man is hound to look\nwell after his investments and see\nthat they are always in good shape.”\n(After some cogitation) “You\ndon’t consider me much of an in\nvestment, do you, papa ?"\nThe Growth cf the Finger Nall*.\nThe philosophy of the finger nail*\nis a most interesting study, simple\nthough it may spjiear at first sight.\nIt has been computed that the\naverage growth of the finger nails\nis one- thirty -second of an inch per\nweek, or u little more than an inch\nand a half per year. The growth,\nhowever, depends to a great extent\nupon the rate of nutrition, and dur\ning periods of sickness it is un\ndoubtedly retarded.\nIt is understood to grow faster in\nsummer than in winter and differs\nfor different fingers, being most rap\nid in the middle finger and slowest\nin the thumb and little finger.\nThey Laughed Twice.\nAn eminent Scotch clergyman\nhappened to dine with some learned\nlawyers of the Edinburgh bar.

It has been observed by\nthose who have ascended about five\nmiles above the earth\'s surface that\nthe sky appears of n dark, inky hue,\nowing to the very small reflection\nand dispersion of the light, while\nthe blue color no longer appears\nabove, but below them.\nOutward Sign.\nT guess you were right about\nGriddle having made a lot of money\nin the last few years.’\n‘What new light have you bad on\nthe subject?’\n‘He has begun to kick about the\nsize of bis taxes.’—Chicago Tribune.\nWat" Some girls waste a lot of time\nlooking for the ideal man when there\narea lot of real ones lying around\nloose,” ■ •\n.( i!\nSProverbs Up-To-Date.\nit tafftea a big man to eat crow\ngracefully.\nModesty is not so easily shocked\nas prudery.\nThe more knowing a man is, the\nless be knows.\nA woman\'s train of thought is of\nten on her dress.\nSometimes a comedian\'s divorce is\nhis first serious part.\nMarriage Is seldom a failure when\nCupid furnishes (lie capital.\nMarrying for money is more a\nmatter of dollars than of sense.\nMany a woman employs a private\ndetective when she looks in her mir\nror.\nIt is not considered to a man\'s\ncredit to merit success if ho doesn’t\nobtain it.\nThe heathen in his blindness uses\na club ; the civilized Christian a re\npeating ride.\nWe shouldn\'t mind woman having\nthe lust word if she’d only get to it\nsooner.- Everybody\'s Magazine.\nDoesn\'t Eespeet Old Ags\nIt\'s shameful when youth fails to\nshow proper respect for old age, but\njust the contrary In the case of Dr.\nKing’s New Life Pills, They cut\noff maladies no matter how severe\nand Irrespective of old age.
