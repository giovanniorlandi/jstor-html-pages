Tho pannikin was\naccompanied by a tin ntato full of cold\nmutton and a wedgo of baking powder\nbread, which between them prevented\nthe ravening man from observing how\nclosely bo was himself observed us he\nassuaged his pangs. There was, how\nover, something in the naturo of n mut\ntered altercation between the bush\nrangers when llowlo was sent back for\nmoro of everything. Vunholmert put It\ndown to his own demands nnd felt\nthat Stlngarco was his friend when It\nwas he who brought tho fresh supplies.\n"Ent away," said Stingaree, seutlng\nhimself and producing pipe and to\nbacco. "It\'s rough fare, but there\'s\nplenty of It"\n"I won\'t ask you for no more," ro\nplled Vanhelmert, pnvlug the way for\nhis escape.\n"Oh, yes, you Willi" said Stingaree.\n"You\'re going to camp with us for tho\nnext few days, my friend I"\n"Why am I" cried Vanhclmcrt,\naghast at the quiet stntemcnt, which It\nnever occurred to him to gainsay,\n"Because the way out of this takes\nsome find lug, and what\'s the use of es\ncaping an unpleasant death ono day if\nyou go and die It the next? That\'s one\nreason," suld Stingaree, "but there\'s\nanother. The reasou is that, now you\'re\nhere, you don t go till I choose."\n"That\'s real kind of you," suld Van\nhelmert. "I don\'t feel like miming no\n.more risks IIll I\'m obliged. My nerves\nare shook. And, If n born back blocker\nmay make so bold, it\'s a fair old treat\nto see a new chum camping out for the\nfun of It."\n"Who told you I was a new chum?\'\nasked Stingaree sliarply.

It was\nthe cleverest touch that Vanhelmert\nhad yet achieved. And ho bad the wit\nneither to blunt his point by rubbing it\nin nor to recall attention to It by subtle\nprotestation of his pretended persua\nslon. But once or twice before sun.\ndown ho permitted himself to ask nntu\nral questions concerning the old conn\ntry and to indulge in those genial gibes\nwblcb the Englishman In tho buxli\nlearns to expect from tho Indigenous\nbuffoon.\nIn tho night Vanhelmert was loss\neasy. He had to sleep in Howie\'s tent,\nbut it was some bourn before hu slept\nat all, for Howie would remain out\nside, and Vanhelmert longed to hear\nhim snore. At last the rabbit er fell\nInto a doze, und when he awoke the\nauspicious music ailed tho tent, lie\nlistened on ono elbow, peering till the\ndarkness turned less dense, and there\nlay Howie across tho opening of t In\ntent.

That dinner Is cits\ntlnctly Interesting to tho pure food\nadvocates In tho United States. The\ndomlnent characteristic of that dinner\nMas to bo the color scheme. White\nwas In fnshlon, so Paddlngton deter\nmined to have all of the foods at the\n-rWlMEi nulte different from their nat\nural hue, with n lcHi-UtaJWrd wji\'.ia.\nHo called a Hungarian miller Into\nconfidence and ordered flour ground\nespecially for tho occasion.\nSuch a thing novcr had been heard\nof before a perfectly white flour. Pro\nduced from tho ground grain of the\nwheat flour naturally takes the com\nmingling colors of the grain nnd there\nfore Is dark. But Paddlngton wanted\nit snow white. It was n hard task for\nthe miller, but nfter mnny efforts he\nsucceeded In producing white flour by\nselecting tho white, lifeless, starchy\nportions of tho grain nnd discarding\nnit others.\nAs he had expected, Pnddlngton\'s\ndinner proved tho novelty of the day,\nand the bread woh a tremendous hit\nThat was the first white bread ever\neaten in the history of the world. As\nthe wheat grain wns dark, so bread\nhad been dark from the days or Abra\nham. The white bread fad, ns It was then\ncalled, spread like wildfire. All the\nsmart set of London took It tip, and\nsoon tho bread made Its appearance on\nthe tables of the ultra fashionable nil\nover England. No one liked It so well\nns tho old-fashioned blood-and-bone-\nproduclng bread. But people often sac\nrifice very much of taste nnd health\nfor fashion\'s sake. That was the wny\nIt was with white bread.\nIt did not taste so good and it was\nnot ns satisfying as the old-tlmo bread,\nDut It looked pretty, the white slices\non tho white tablecloth; and no other\nkind of bread was permitted at din\nner in stylish London. Flour mills\nhad to bo reconstructed, and new ma\nchinery had to bn devised.\nFrom England the fnd spread to\nether countries, always tho fashionable\ncircles taking It up first and the com\nmon people following. Xowhere waH\ntho habit spifeod faster than In Amer\nica. When the American woman once\nset her eyes on tho white loaf, she wns\nwon over completely. At first, the loaf\nIn America was not so bad. It was not\nso white as It ts now, but more of n\neramy color. Its crumb was elen\ntic and of a sweet flavor. It had not\nJ)cen robbed of all Its nutriment. Only\nthe husk and the germ of the wheat\nbad been removed in the milling, nnd\nthe bread wos yet rich In gluten.\nHut the American housewife was not\nsatisfied with this. The Idea of thr\nwhite loaf seemed to grow on her and\nto captivate her. She wanted the Hour\nas white as possible and ground as tltu-\nas possible.\nThe American woman is not an ex\ntremlst. Rather conservative Is she,\nlover of moderation In everything. But\nthere are exceptions to all rules, they\nsay, and in this matter of the white\nflour craze she certainly went the lltti\nIt. When tho miller had made the flou\nho wiino Hint it coma uo made no\nwhiter, when all the starch in the\nwheat bad been exhausted, ho had to\nturn to other sources to supply the de\nmand for starch, but still the house\nwife was not satisfied. Finally the\nmiller was forced to resort to bleach\'\ning chemically. This came near de\nstroylng what little life was left In\ntho flour nnd Introduced a chemical\nsubstance whlch-Tiiado it harmful\nRecognizing the harm of tho bleach-\ned flour, a strong effort was made to\nprohibit It, but tho millers liked It be\ncause It enabled them to uso up all the\nmoldy and bad wheat that otherwise\nwould go to waste. By tho bleaching\nprocoss any klud of wheat may be\nconverted into white flour. So the\npeople wanted It and tho millers want-\ned it, and thorn was nothing to do but\nto let the business go on, nnd that Is\nthe reason most of tho flour on the\nmarket today Is of tombstone white\nness.\nThe demand for finely ground flour\nlias kept pace with that for whiteness.\nnnd has forced the miller to such ex-\nti ernes that his now actually slftlnn\nthe flour through layers of Bilk, mak\ning a product so fleecy that tho ex\npression "flno as dust" was long ngo\nrendered useless In trying to describe\nIt. And still, If wo can bollovo what\nthe millers say. tho American woman\nIh asking that tho flour bo made whiter\nand finer.\nIn this day (hero Is almost no sale\nfor the old-fashioned bread that fed\nour hardy forofnthn\nwon\'t have It when It won\'t match tho\ntablecloth.\nUeorgo U\'nlllngford. 2(5 years old.\ndied Sunday night nt tho home of his\nfather, Mr. .Manford Walllugford, near\nMt.
