Dan\niel Bailey, a soldier who was arrest\ned in Ireland on April 21st, accom\npanied Casement to the dock.

The\nprimaries to elect delegates to the\n.state conventions of both parties\nwill be held on Tuesday, August 8th,\nwhile the state nominations will be\nheld on Tuesday, September 5th, at\na place to \'oe selected by the state\ncentral committee of each party, and\nthe county conventions will be held\non Tuesday, September 16th, at the\ncounty seat of each county. There\nis nearly a month between the time\nthe primaries are held and the con\nvening of the state conventions,\nwhich is another angle of the situa\ntion that presents an interesting\nthought, and no doubt will cause\nmuc\'h anxiety andl worry among the\ndifferent candidates. Conferences\nand caucuses will be numerous dur\ning that period, as political fences\nare liable to become disarranged,\nwires crossed and a feeling of inse\ncurity created in the minds oi the\ndifferent candidates. This might be\ninteresting to the public, but will be\nhard on" the candidates. One of the\ncandidates expressed himself thus-J\nwise: "I wish the fellow that framed\nthat primary law and worked it\nthrough the legislature was in hades."\nTo which the other candidates add\namen.\nThe senatorial station in iboth\nparties is seemingly in a state of\nquietude, but to a close observer in\npolitics it is only the calm before\nthe storm. Plenty of underground\nplotting and scheming is going on,\nbut is being as carefully concealed\nawd1 ere long many things will\' crop\nto the surface and the public will\nthen get on to the fact that there has\nbeen something doing all the time.\nIn the interests of the candidacy of\nPittman, and McCarran the friends of\nboth are making strenuous efforts to\ncontrol he convention.\nThe coming out of George A. Bart\nlett as a candidate for the supreme\njudgship was one of the surprises\nin political circles last week, al\nthough) it was pretty well understood\nthat at a conference of a few politi\ncal leaders in the office of a promi\nnent state official in the state capitol\nabout two weeks ago the matter was\ndiscussed and it was then and there\ntentatively- decided that Bartlett\nshould ccme out as a candidate. In\nthe meantime the friends of Judge\nEmmett Walsh, hearing of this, be\ngan writing him letters urging him to\nbecome a candidate, and this phase\nof the situation became public when\nRobert Richards, ,\'chairman of the\nWashoe Democratic county central\ncommittee, fired in a number of tele-\nj grams signed by himself and other\nmercy. They dragged him to the\nsquare, where the leader of the crowd\ntied a rope about his neck and jerked\nhim into the air as thousands cried\n"burn him." The leader then poured\noil on the heap of crates, and cord\nwood which had been piled beneath\nthe three. This was lighted and the\nrope cut. Washington, shrieking,\ndropped into the flames, the yells of\nthe crowd drowning his cries. He\nburned for twenty1 minutes.\nSidelights On\nNow Approaching\nleading Democrats asking Walsh to\nconsent to make the race, stating\nthey believed him to be the strongest\nman in the party for the position and\nassuring him of their hearty support.\nWaiS\'h has not given a deemed\nanswer, "but - has it under considera\ntion. It is generally believed by his\nfriends that his official announcement\nwill be forthcoming in a few days.\nWhen mention was made in the\nAppeal a short time ago that Joe\nFarnsworth would probably be\nbrought out by fois friends as a .can\ndidate for- congressional honors,\nsome questioned the seriousness of\nthe suggestion, but be that as it\nmay, the fact remains, that discus\nsion of his candidacy by prominent\nDemocrats lias brought forth strong\narguments by his admirers that\nFarnsworth is a great vote getter.\nHowever, alii admit that Ed Caine\nof Elko is a strong candidate who can\nalso win. Farnsworth\'s friends claim\nthat he is the most available man\nwith which to beat Roberts; that the\nDemocratic party has been for six\nyears trying to" dig up a man who\ncould deliver a knock-out blow to\nthe prize vote getter of the Republi\ncan party, and they are satisfied that\nFarnsworth has the punch to do it\nBut to all this Joe has very little to\nsay.\nThe Supreme Court clerkship de\npends almost altogether upon who is\nnominated for congress. If Ed Caine\nof Elko is nominated it will naturally\neliminate Kenneth from the race, as\nElko county would hardly expect\nboth positions. That would leave a\nclear field for Mighels, unless some\ncandidate from the south sprang up,\nand rumors are to the effect that\nthere will be a candidate from there\noutside of Glyde Johnson, who, from\nall reports, has d-efinitely decided\nnot to make the race. But in the\nevent that Judge Walsh should se\ncure the nomination for supreme\njudge the southern section will be\nwell taken care of andl could not ex\npect anything more.\nFriends of McCarran see in the can-\nContinued on Fourth Page\nNo Confirmation\nof Any New Raids\nBy United Press\n- WASHINGTON, May 15.

No Republican candidate for president needs\nheadquarters less than Elihu Root, says the New York Herald, tor he\nis a large part of the nominating m-achinery of the Republican party\n-and the rest of the machinery is in confidential relation with him.\nNobody knows better than Mr. Root tha-t the Republican candidate\nfor president -will be named-by a select committee composed of \'him\nself, .Murray Crane, William Barnes, Senator Penrose, Joseph G. Can\n&on and half a dozen other patriots who will do the thinking Tor the\n\'national convention. All these gentlemen are intimately acquainted\nwith Elihu Root, and most of them woukl like to nominate him. They\nmay have \'doubts about his availability, but none about his ability.\nThe obstacle to Mr. Root\'s nomination is Bull Moose antagonism,\nand that will not be removed by campaign headquarters. The average\nProgressive professes to detest Root\'s Wall street connections, but\nthat is aJl buncombe. Root in politics is no more servile to Wall street\nthan is Roosevelt.\nroller at the Chicago convention in 1912 and flattened out the colonel.\n1 The real Bull Moose grievance against Root is that he ran the steam\nThat is the reason why the progressives hate him. They believe that\nwith any other chairman of the convention Roosevelt could have Dluffed\nthe nomination through. A Root headquarters could be opened in\nevery town in the country without making the faintest impression on\nthat sentiment.\n\' If Elihu Root is nominated for president it will be because the\nregular Republicans ihave the courage of their contempt for the Pro\ngressives, and courage is one of the\' qualities in which the Republican\nparty is painfully deficient.\n00\nTHE THIRD TERMERS.\nWashington was not given at third term as president.\n- Nor was Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, nor any other man.\nUlysses S. Grant sought a Ahird term and! was refused it.\n, Theodore . Roosevelt has been president twice and will be enrolled\nwith others who have been so honored.\nCould he be given a third term Jiis place in American history\nwould be unique. His honors would dwarf the honors of Washington,\nJefferson, Lincoln and Grant.\nSurely the prize is not one to excite the ambition of a politician\nnot too great to prefer his personal gratification to the destruction of\nhis country\'s traditions.\nSurely it is natural that the most selfishly ambitious man in this\ncountry \'has known seeks the prize.\nTheodore Roosevelt looks forward to the time when his name shall\nbe written in the school books in association with. Washington, Jeffer\nson, Lincoln and Grant as Roosevelt, the only three-trmie president.\nIt is within the bounds of possibility that his ambition will be\ngratified though it is far from probable. Brazenry of asking is some\ntimes rewarded by success in getting. When a man tells the peopls\nthat he is .greater than they and greater than those who have gone be\nfore and keeps on telling it in a loud voice the people may believe it\nwhether in the state or in the republic.\nThe politician who insistently and perseveringly proceeds on the\ntheory that the people can be fooled sometimes meets with strange\nsuccesses.
