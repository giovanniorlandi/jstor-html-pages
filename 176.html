T. Howerton.) *\nI believe statistics show that\nninety per cent of all men m\ntowns in successful business, all\nbankers, doctors, lawyers, mer\nchants, were \'-born and largely\neducated in the country. Students\nof economy have noted this and\ncommented on it. I want to call\nattention to ONE factor which\nseems to me to have been over\nlooked—the sleep habits of the\ncountry youth. Let me ill us\ntrate this with our southern ne\ngro. When the true history of\nnegro slavery is written it will\nbe a great big contribution to in\ndustrial education; or to put it\nanother way around, when the\nhistory of industrial education is\nwritten it will include some very\nlarge commendatory remarks on\nnegro slavery as the best system\nof industrial education yet seen\nin these Southern States. But 1\nfear that the writer of this his.\ntory will leave out ONE item —\nONE large factor—the sleep hab\nits of the negro slave, as com\npared with the sleep habits of\nthe present negro. If someone\nwill take the present negro\', and\nput him to bed in clean, comfor\ntable, well ventilated “quarters”\nabout 9 P. M. and haye bun “up\nand doing” about 5 A. M. we\nmight soon see decidedly more\ntnan a mere ten percent, as now,\nof trained youth succeeding wiih\nthe town’s business. There is ft\nrecuperative value in sleep at\nnight, there is a joyous inspira\ntion to the wide awake youth In\na sun rise, there is an exhilara.\ntion in the before-sun-up breeze,\nthere is a daily rebaptism by the\nwhole surroundings of the early\nmom, which the town dweller\nwho has retired about midnight\nso often misses that this ONK\nlack alone may account for a\nvast deal of the want of thrift\nshown by the boys and girls who\nlive in towns and are “educated**\nin our high schools. Are the\nschools really taking note of the\nsleep habits of their pupils and\ngiving “credits” for good rec\nords and right habits In this too\noften “lost art?” Or are they\nassigning “lessons” tor ‘Vmght\nstudy’ which will keep the pupil\nporing over books into the “wee\nsmall hours.”\n‘‘Clean-up-week” should be\nevery week.\nCHICHESTER S PILLS\nDIAMOND BRAND\nLADIES f\nfor CHI-CHES-TER\'S A\nDIAMOND BRAND PILLS in Rkd and /\\\nGoto metallic boxes, sealed with Bluest}V\nRibbon.

This shop\nwindow is unlike the actual plate glass show\ncase only in one respect —it makes display of\ndescriptions instead of articles.\nYou have often been impressed by the\ndifference between, the decorations of two\nwindow-trimmers, each of whom employed\nthe same materials for his work. The one drew\nyour attention and held it by the grace and\ncleverness and art manifested in his display.\nThe other realized so little of the possibilities\nin the materials placed at his disposal that un\nless someone called your attention to his\nbungling you would have gone on unconscious\nof its existence.\nAn advertiser must know that he gets his\nresults in accordance with the skill exercised\nin preparing his verbal displays. He must\nmake people stop and pause. His copy has to\nstand out.\nHe must not only make a show of thing*\nthat arc attractive to the eye but are attractive\nto the people’s needs as well.\nThe windov,-trimmer must not make the\nmistake of thinking that the showiest stocks\nare the most salable. The advertiser muft not\nmake the mistake of thinking that the showiest\nwords are the most clinching.\nWindows are too few in number to be\nused with indiscretion. The good merchant\nputs those goods back of his plate glass which\nnine people out of ten will want after they\nhave seen them.\nThe good advertiser tells about goods\nwhich nine readers out of ten will buy ii they\ncan be convinced.\nNewspaper space ivself is only the win\ndow, just as the showcase js but a frame for\nmerchandise pictures. A window on a crowd\ned street in the best neighborhood, where\nprosperous persons pass continually, is more\ndesirable than one in a cheap, sparsely settled\nneighborhood. An advertisement in a news\npaper with the most readers and the most,\nprosperous ones possesses a great advantage\nover the same copy in a medium circulating\nsmong persons who possess less means. It\nwould be foolish for a shop to build its win\ndows in the alleyway—and just as much so to\nput its advertising into newspapers which arc\ndistributed among “alley-dwellers.”\nCOoFjrrifffcl.

In\nrecent interviews with physic\nlans on rhe grave and serious\nconsequences ot a deficiency of\nPhosphaies in ’the hrh>od of\nAmerican men and women.
