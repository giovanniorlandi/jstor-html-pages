No. 42.\nPhiladelphia Show Given Top\nBilling’ Since Smith’s Talk\n*\nMorgan’s Speech Delivered\nPrior To League Meet\ning Dealt With Prepara\ntions For Convention\nBy HERBERT PLUMMER\n<ll>- AxiuiHalfil Pr*)\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 18.—Sev\neral day* before AI Smith made j\nhi* speech to the Liberty leaguers\nin Washington and before any one\nknew what the former Democrat!* i\nnominee for the presidency would\nsay, W. Forbes Morgan, secretary\nof the party’s national committee,\nwent on the air to tell about prep\narations for the Philadelphia con\nvention.\nMorgan’s speech, for the most\npart, was deVoted to a recital of\nroutine instructions to delegates\nand others who plan to be pres\nent. At the end, however, he\nmade a statement which now\nseems prophetic.\n“We Democrats,” he said, “have\nhad many charges and complaints\nhurled against us during our many\nyears of political life, but no one\nyet has ever accused us of being\ntiresome or dull. When we have\na family disagreement we ‘speak\nright out in meeting’ and say\nexactly what we mean.”\nApparently Morgan has called\nthe shot. Al Smith’s threat to\n“take a walk” at Philadelphia:\nvirtually assures the "Democratic\nconvention in June in the “City!\nof Brotherly Love” Position No. J\n1 among the political spectacles of j\nthe year.\nPhiladelphia Indebted\nThose citizens of Philadelphia:\nwho raised the ante in such boldj\nfashion over Chicago in Washing-!\nton a few weeks ago for the priv-i\nilege of being hosts to the Demo-j\ncratic national convention owe a|\ndeep debt of gratitude to Smith.\nBefore his speech to Liberty\nleaguers it was to Cleveland and\nthe Republican national conven\ntion that politicians and observers\nturned their eyes for the big show\nof 1936. The Cleveland gathering\nstill will receive a good share of\nattention, but the Philadelphia*\nshow definitely has been rated fori\n“top billing.”\nHad there been any doubt of 1\nthis, the scenes enacted in the\nhouse of representatives within 48\nhours of Smith’s speech and fol\nlowed shortly thereafter by the\nsavage reply of Senator Robinson j\nof Arkansas, his running mate in\n1928, certainly dispelled it.\nLittle was left to the imagina\ntion as to how supporters of the\nRoosevelt administration reacted\nto the former New York gover\nnor’s attack after these replies.\nRepublicans Delighted\nThere will be repetition of this\nsort of thing almost constantly\nfrom now on. Smith’s disavowal;\nof the “new deal" has delighted;\nthe Republicans and they may be!\nexpected to make political capital\nof it at every opportunity.\nAs for the Democrats, the his\ntory of the party invariably shows\nthat they much prefer an honest\nfree-for-all scrap among them\nselves to one with the Republi\ncans. Most of them take it that*\ndemocracy itself is founded on\nthat principle.\nMany in the party—both sup- i\nporters of the “new deal” as well\nas those violently opposed—who\notherwise might have stayed\naway from Philadelphia on the I\npremi.se that the convention\nwould be a cut and dried affair\nat best will be found in the van\nguard of the Democratic trek to\nPhiladelphia this June.\nSTRICTLY FRESH KILLED\nBEEF\nKOSHER MEAT\nBermuda Meat Market\nPhone 52 Quick Delivery\nCor.

FACA 22R8880\nBABY MANTA IS\nDISCOVERED IN\nBIG DEVILFISH\nMONSTER TAKEN BY YACHT\nING PARTY RECENTLY\nWAS FOUND TO WEIGH\ni\nOVER ONE TON\nThis morning while the giant\ni devilfish, or Manta Borotris, was\ni\nhanging on a crane in the naval\nstation, a baby Manta weighing\nabout GO pounds was taken from\nit by those who were preparing to\nremove the hide.\nAs the animal would soon be\ngin to it was decided\nto remove it from the Yacht Shi\nawassee, weigh it and then re\nmove the hide, if possible. It was j\nfirst taken to the scales at the:\nlighthouse department where it j\nwas found that allowing for drying :\n; out during Sunday, yesterday and\n1 last night, and loss of blood, it\nweighed, when caught, more than\none ton.\nIt was while the hide was be- j\ning removed that it was seen that j\nthe larger fish contained a small\ner one. This when removed, was j\ngiven to Wallace B. Kirke, who\nwill endeavor to find some old\ntimer who will remove the hide,!\nintact, if this is possible.\nDuring the process of remov- 1\ning the hide, pieces of which werej\nsecured by a number of bystand-,\ners, quite a few photographs were j\ntaken of the monster.\nAWAIT APPROVAL\nON REVISION OF\nSTEEL FERRIES\'\n\' I\n: INSPECTOR WITH BUREAU OF,\nNAVIGATION SENDS RECOM- j\nMENDATIONS TO WASHING\nTON FOR SANCTION\nWord has been received from\nCapt. Chester W. Willett, travel\ning inspector and stability expert\n‘ with the Bureau of Navigation\nj that the proposed revisions in the.\nnew ferries recently brought here,\n! have been sent to Washington!\nwith his recommendations.\nThis was the advice received:\nby Franklin E. Albert, executive!\n; officer here for Key West Ad\nministration, who pointed out that)\nthe local inspectors and the sup-\'\nervising office in New Orleans!\nhad passed on the plans and that\nonly the approval of Washington!\nremain*. It is essential that this\nbe done before the ferries can be\nput on the runs between No Namo\nKey and Matecumbe Key.\nEvery effort is being made to\nhave approval of the plans given\n; in Washington as soon as possible,\nj it was said.\nCAPTAIN BOYD\nARRIVES HERE\nFAMOUS AVIATOR AND\nOTHERS COME IN ON PLANE\nTHIS AFTERNOON\nCaptain Errol Boyd, famous\naviator and. holder of a number of\nrecords, arrived in his 525 H.

He was one\nof those who thought he could compete\nwith his competitors who advertised, and\nfailed to invite the public to his place of\nbusiness.\nThe power companies did not put up\nmuch of a struggle to have the TV A out\nlawed, evidently thinking it would go the\nway of the NR A and the AAA and verify\ning the saying that all good things come in\nthree’s, but this time the prognostication\nwent awry.\nCandidates other than for the United\nStates senate or house of representatives\nwhen their aspirations are achieved can\nnot vote for the Townsend Plan or do very\nmuch about it, so what reason can they\nhave to incorporate this item in their plat\nform but as a lure “ad captandum vul\ngus.”\nWhenever there is danger of the\nusurpation of power by individual in\nhigh places, we should npesolve to do all\nthat is possible for the fulfillment of Lin\ncoln’s most profound desire that a “Gov\nernment of the people, by the people, and\nfor the people, shall not perish from the\nearth.”\nTwo thoughts of moment are before\nthe American people at the present time:\nWhere will the bonus money come from,\nand after it has irrived where will it go?\nEvery business man is speculating how\nmuch of the billions will come his way.\nThere is so much of it, that everybody in\nevery walk of life will beneiit to some de\ngree. After the deluge of dollars comes\nthe day of reckoning. j\n“I KNOW YOU AND YOU KNOW iME”\nThe above might be a good slogan for\nthe business people of Key West to have\nin small type some where in every ad. On\ncards about the store and in the store win\ndow it would be wholesomely suggestive.\nThe business man you know and who\nknows you would not be so foolish even if\nhe were dishonest enough to do what cured\none man of buying from mail order houses\nwhose managers he didn’t know and who\nwould probably high-hat him if they met\non the street.\nThis former mail-order buyer ordered\nwhat appeared to be a fine, colorful, all\nwool lumber-jack. He looked forward\neagerly to its arrival. He thought how\nproud he would be to wear it in the pres\nence of his fellow workers.\nWhen the package finally arrived\nand he opened it his spirits drooped. They\nsent a substitute—a drab dirty gray af\nfair. But—here is what incensed him and\ncured him of reading “bargain” catalogs.\nA note accompanying the garment said,\n“We were out of the $3.98 coat which you\nordered but rather than disappoint you we\nare sending your size in our number so and\nso. This fine garment is from our $6.00\nstock.”\nNow had the purchaser known the\nsubstituting tactics of this house he would\nnot have ordered. Had the house known\nthis customer and his experience with\nwoolen goods they would not have tried to\nslip one of their lower grade long-profit\ngarments over on him as though it were\na higher grade one.\nThe local merchant who knows you\nand whom you know would have better\nsense than to wilfully sell inferior goods\nat a long profit. His number of customers\nis limited. The next time he meets you he\nwants you to feel right toward him.\nBut since you know him personally\nyou know he wouldn’t resort to such\ntactics—even if he could “get away with\nit.”\nWAR REPORTS CONFLICT\nThe present warfare in Ethiopia is\nrather difficult to follow with certainty.\nThe official statements of the two nations\ninvolved, Italy and Ethiopia, are very con\ntradictory at times and leaves much to be\ndesired from a standpoint of frankness.\nis nothing new in warfare. The\nreadi. g public experienced the same doubt\nand uncertainty during the World War at\nmany stages as the communiques of the\nvarious governments claimed too much, de\nnied reports of their adversaries and some\ntimes omitted reference to important\nevents.\nSo it is to one trying to follow the\nmilitary campaign in Ethiopia. Recently,\nboth sides claimed decided advantages in\nthe northern sector, in the Tembien re\ngion. The Italians got to the press with\nthe first report of an offensive which they\nundertook to forestall an Ethiopian attack,\nclaiming that they killed 20,000 soldiers of\nthe Emperor with a loss of only 743 for\nthemselves.\nThe Ethiopian leaders claimed to have\nregained the initiative, to have routed\nsuperior forces, killing 8,000 Italians\nagainst only 1,100 of their own soldiers,\nspecifically claiming the capture of thirty\nthree field guns, seventy-five machine\nguns, 2,600 rifles and eighteen tanks.\nAll of which suggests that reports of\nmilitary operations by belligerents should\nbe taken with several grains of the pro\nverbial salt.\nREADING PROVOKES THINKING\nAmong the 1936 resolutions that you\nprobably forgot to make ought to have\nbeen one that you would read a sensible\nbook, on a sensible subject, at least every\nmonth.\nWhen a man or woman takes a year\nto write a book on any subject, those in\nterested in the topic ought to be able to\nstand the work for several hours, without\nbrainfag.\nThere are entirely too many people in\nKey West who take it for granted that\nthey can learn everything that is worth\nknowing from current comment related by\ngossipping friends.\nThinking is what makes men amount\nto something. The more the people of a\ncommunity think the better and the more\nj prosperous that community is. You needn’t\n! ask us to prove that statement. We\nj haven\'t the time and doubt if we have the\ni brains, but it is the truth, all the same.\nTHE KEY WEST CITIZEN\nKEY WEST IN\nDAYS GONE BY j\nHappenings Here Just 10 Years!\nAgo Today As Taken From\nThe Files Of The Citizen\nj\nSheriff Roland Ccrry this morn- j\ning received notice from the:\nUnited States Marshal at Miami j\nthat warrants had been issued for 1\nnine of the Key Westers arrested\nin the prohibition raids several\ndays ago.

But Bobby, who\nfound the man, cannot help but be\nmoved by Frankie Derwent’s argu\nment that the man must have been\npushed over the edge, that the ones\nwho pushed him believe Bobby\nknows more than he has told and\nthat they are trying to do away\nwith him. Be picks up a newspaper,\nand suddenly he pushes the bell by\nhis hospital bed.\nChapter 11\nBASSINGTON-FFRENCH\n"IITHATEVER’S the matter, Mr.\n* * Jones? Are you taken bad?" the\nnurse demanded.\n"Ring up the Castle," cried Bobby.\n“Tell Lady Frances she must come\nback here at once."\n"Oh, Mr. Jones—you can’t send a\nmessage like that.”\n“Can\'t I?’’ said Bobby. “If I were\nallowed to get up from this blasted\nbed, you’d soon see whether 1 could\nor couldn’t. As it is, you’ve got to\ndo it for me.’’\n“But she’ll hardly be back.”\n“You don’t know that Bentley.”\n“She won’t have had her tea.”\n“Now look here, my dear girl,’’\nsaid bobby, "don’t stand there argu\ning with me. Ring up as I tell you.\nTell her she’s got to come here at\nonce because I’ve got something\nvery Important to say to her.’’\nOverborne, though unwilling, the\nnurse went. Sho took some liberties\n•with Bobby’s message. If it was no\ninconvenience to Lady Frances, Mr.\nJones wondered if she would mind\ncoming, as he had something he\nwou’d like to say to her. But of\ncourse Lady Frances was not to put\nhers3lf out in any way.\nLady Frances replied curtly that\nshe would come at once.\n“Depend upon it,’’ said the nurse to\nher colleagues, "she’s sweet on him!\nThat’s what it is.”\nFrankie arrived all tgog. “What’s\nthis desperate summons?” she de\nmanded.\nBobby was sitting up in bed, a\nbright red spot in each cheek. In his\nhand he waved the copy of the\n“Marchbolt Weekly Times.”\n“Look at this, Frankie.”\nFrankie looked. “Well?” she de\nmanded.\n“This is the picture you meant\nwhen you said it was touched up but\nquite like the Cayman woman?’’\nBobby’s Anger pointed to a some\nwhat blurred reproduction of a pho\ntograph. Underneath it were the\nwords:\n"Portrait found on the dead man\nby which he was identified: Mrs.\nAmelia Cayman, the dead man’s sis\nter.”\n“That’s what 1 said—and it’s true,\ntoo. 1 can’-: see anything to rave\nover in it."\n“No more can I.”\n“But you said—”\n“I know 4 ’said.’ But you see,\nFrankie —” Bobby’s voice became\nvery impressive—“this isn’t the pho\ntograph that 1 put back in the dead\nman’s pocket. . . .”\nThey looked at each other.\n“Then, in that case—” began\nFrankie slowly.\n“Either there must have been two\nphotographs—”\n“ —which isn’t likely—”\n“ —or else—’’\nThey paused.\n“That man —what’s his name?”\nsaid Frankie.\n“Bassington-ffrench!" said Bobby.\n\'T\'HEY stared at each other as they\n* tried to adjust themselves to\nthe altered situation.\n“It couldn’t be anyone else,” said\nBobby. “He was the only person who\nhad the chance.”\n“Unless, as we said, there were\ntwo photographs?”\n“We agreed that that wasn’t like\nly. It there had been two photo\ngraphs they’d have tried to identify\nhim by mean* of both of them—not\nby only one.”\n“Anyway that’s easily found out,"\nsaid Frankie. “We can ask the po\nlice. We’ll assume for the moment\nthat there was Just the one photo\ngraph—the one you saw, that you\nput back again in the man’s pocket.\nIt was there when you left him. and\nit wasn’t there when the police came.\nTherefore the only person who could\nhave taken it away and put the other\none in its place is this man Bassing\nton-ffrench. What was he like, Bob\nby?”\nBobby frowned in the effort to re\nmember. “A sort of nondescript fel\nlow. Pit asant voice. A gentleman\nand all that. - really didn’t notice\nhim particularly. He said be was a\nstranger dowr here —and something\nabout looking for a house.”\n! “We can verify that anyway,” said\nFrankie. “Wheeler & Owen are the\nonly house agents.” Suddenly she\ngave a shiver. “Bobby, have you\nthought? If Pritchard was pusbed\nToday In History\n1546—Died—aged 62, . Martin\nLuther, leader of the Protestant\nRevolution in Germany.\n1793—The Chisholm versus\nGeorgia decision by the U. S.

But you know,\nFrankie, we can’t be sure Pritchard\nreally was pushed over.”\n“I’m quite sure!”\n“You have been, all along.”\n"No. 1 just wanted it to be that\nway because it made things more ex\nciting. But now it’s more or less\nproved. If It was murder everything\nfits in. Your unexpected appearance\nwhich upsets the murderer’s plans.\nYour discovery of the photograph\nand, i.. consequence, the need to put\nyou out of the way."\n“There’s a flaw there,” said Bobby.\n“Why? You were the only person\nwho saw that photograph. As soon\nas Bassington-ffrench was left alone\nwith the body be changed the pho\ntograph, which only you had seen."\nBut Bobby continued to shake bis\nhead. "No, that won’t do. Let’s grant\nfor the moment that that photograph\nwas so important that 1 bad to be\n‘got out of the way.’ as you put it.\nSounds absurd, but I suppose it’s\njust possible. Well then, whatever\nwas going to ue done would have to\nbe done at once. The fact that I went\nto London and never saw the\n"Weekly Times” or the other pa\npers with the photograph in them\nwas Just pure chance —a thing no\nbody could count on. The probabili\nty was that 1 should say at ouce,\n’That Isn’t the photograph 1 saw.\nWhy wait till after the inquest when\neverything was nicely settled?”\n“There’s something in that," ad\nmitted Frankie.\n"And there’s another point. I can’t\nbe absolutely sure, of course, but 1\noould almost swear that when I put\nthe photograph back in the dead\nman’s pocket Bassington • ffrench\nwasn’t there. He didn’t arrive till\nabout five or ten minutes later.”\n"He might have been watching\nyou all the time,’’ argued Frankie.\n“I don’t see very well how be could\nhave,” said Bobby slowly. “There’s\nreally only one place where you can\nsee down to exactly the spot we\nwere. Farther round, the cliff\nbulges and then recedes underneath\nso that you can’t see over. There’s\njust the one place, and when Bass\nington-ffrench did arrive there I\nheard him at once. Footsteps echo\ndown below. Ht may have been near\nat hand, but he wasn\'t looking over\ntill then—that I’ll swear."\nTHEN you think that he didn’t\nknow about your seeing the\nphotograph ?”\n"1 don’t set how he could have\nknown." .\n"And he can’t have been afraid\nyou’d seen him doing it—the mur\nder, 1 mean—because, as you say,\nthat’s absurd. You’d never have held\nyour tongue about it. It looks as\nthough It must have been some\nthing else altogether."\n“Only 1 don’t see what it could\nhave been.”\n“Something they didn’t kno .\nabout till after the inquest. 1 don’t\nknow why 1 say they—”\n“Why not? After all, the Caymans\nmust have been in it, too. It’s prob\nably a gang. I like gangs.”\n“That’s a low taste.” said Frankie\nabsently. “A single-handed murder\nis much higher class. Bobby!"\n“Yes?"\n"What was it Pritchard said just\nbefore he died? You know, you told\nme about it that day on the links.\nThat funny question?"\n“\'Why didn’t they ask Evans?’"\n“Yes. Suppose that was it”\n“But that’s ridiculous.”\n“It sounds so. but It might be Im\nportant really Bobby, I’m sure it’s\nthat Oh, no, I’m being an idiot—\nyou never told the Caymans about\nit.”\n“I did, as a matter of fact," said\nBobby slowly.\n“You did?"\n“Yes. 1 wrote to them that eve\nning. Saying that of course it was\nprobably quite unimportant.”\n“And what happened?"\n“Cayman wrote back politely\nagreeing that of course there was\nnothing In it, but thanking me for\ntaking the trouble. I felt rather\nsnubbed.”\n“And two days later you got this\nletter from a strange firm bribing\nyou to go to South America?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well," said Frankie. “I don’t\nknow what more you want. They try\nthat first. You turn It down. And\nthe next thing is that they follow\nyou round and seize a good moment\nto empty a lot of morphia into your\nbottle of beer.”\n“Then the Caymans are in It?”\n“Of course the Caymans are in It!"\n“Yea,” said Bobby thoughtfully.\n“If your reconstruction is correct,\nthey’ve simply got to be in it"\n(Cofyrigkt 1931-35-36, Agatha Christie)\nTomorrow, Frankie and Bobby\ndiacovar atill another clue.\ncountry that it led to the 11th\nAmendment to the Constitution.\n- ]\n1861—Jefferson Davis inaugu\nrated President of the Confeder- j\nate States of America.\n1913—President Madero of j\nMexico taken prisoner by Gen. j\nHuerta in civil war—Madero as- J\nsassinated on the 23rd, while j\nprisoner.\n1927—Senate passes bill putt-j\ning radio under Government con\ntrol.
