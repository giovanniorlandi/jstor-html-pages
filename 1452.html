ROCKEFELLER,,, of (’routed Butte., For Cbnntf Comroiimloacr:, JOHN M. ALLEN,, of Gunnison., The District Judge., This fall the people of the Sev, enth Judicial district will elect a, judge who will hold office for six, years. It is therefore important, that the voters brinf? to bear on, this question something more than, political prejudice. There ought, not be the least politics in it., Fairly and justly administered, it, is an office without any possible :, political significance. The one, to occupy that place should feel, that he has no faction to reward, and no enemies to punish. He, should have a judicial mind, that, is not a gift of Nature, not a con, dition born of bitter contests in, the primaries, not fostered by ob, ligation to any class of men whose, business is sanctioned by openly, ignoring the law. It comes from, long training; from overcoming,, not fostering prejudice: from yield, ing in ambition instead of letting, ambition run riot. Above all, lie, must be fitted with a life training,, must have a mind prepared and, mature., The Democratic nominee has, all the disadvantages, all unfavor*, able environments that can be, brought together for the office., His start is that of the politician, solely. His nomination was ex, pensive and by means that do not, nftmse hope. To the public it has, been said in his behalf, and in the, newspapers quoted ns coming from i, him, that it was a “bread and, butter proposition” for him to be, elected. This violates every canon, of judicial dignity and require, ments., The people do not want a judge, who must learn to forgot, and in, deed has much to forget that has, no place on the bench. The peo, ple do not want a judge to guess, and to learn the ways of the law., The justice of a case should be, dealt out not according to the, i, CRESTED BUTTE, GUNNISON COUNTY, COLORADO, OCTOBER 16, 1900., j politics or personal regard for the, attorney in the case, but the very, right of the matter. If people, come to understand that some, certain attorneys are to be favored,, j some certain litigants to be pun, ished, some crimes to be over-,, looked, then little confidence can, be placed in the courts., It is not judicious to place on, the bench one who makes more, there than elsewhere; it then be, comes a pension department, a, sinecure and the holder a mere, place hunter. The office may af, fect tomorrow the man who has, never had a lav suit in his life; it, can bo used to retard development, of mining enterprise; it can be a, check to law breakers or foster, those who live by their wits., In tho person of Hon. Tlios. 0., Brown, the Republicans have of, fered the best material, best pre, pared and most fully equipped, man in the district. He does not, have to profess a broad, liberal, spirit because his life has ex, emplified it. He starts with the, Democratic majority against him,, but lins also tho support of those, who believe that the district judge, ought to bo better that any po, litical organization. The only ob, jection that has been or can be, urged against him is that he is of, the Republican party; yet that ob, jection falls to the ground when it, is remembered that it was a Re, publican judge who placed Judge, Stevens’ name on tho Democratic, ticket. It shows Hint party, tics does not necessarily rule. No, one is foolish enough to believe, that Judge Brown would be a par, tisan on the bench. He is not, narrow, not bigoted, not bound to, any faction, no enemies to punish., He comes with clean hands to dis, charge the duties of tho office in, the open light of day in an impar, tial and manly way., To vote nguinst him because he, is a Republican is to argue that, neither ability nor honesty is to be, considered in filling a judicial, position; or that the voter never, gave justice, never desired it, and 1, woyld display a mind too weak to], be considered in the onward and!, upward movement of humanity, a !, mind not capable of conceiving of, justice. It is time for tho people, Jo think, to lay aside politics so, fur as this office is concerned and, do something that will be for the, benefit of the people during tho, next six years. Six years will be, a long time for mischief to be, done. If the right thing is done, now those six years may be full, of confidence, liopo and peace.-- 1, Ouray Herald., Sentimental persons who love to, read of “beautiful death scenes”, will be shocked to learn on the au, thority of a soldier who stood by, Gen. Lawton when lie passed away, that the general\'s last words wore, “Hang the luck!” This was the, staunch veteran’s retort to the bul, let that ninde hia death wound., The words will not look pretty in, the annals of emotional necrology,, but they doubtless expressed the, general’s sentiments at the time, much more truly than any of the, mortuary bon mots which may be, ascribed to him in the story books, and will receive more respectful, j consideration from the recording, angel., Our Representative., The Republican party of Gun, nison county honored itself by |, nominating Dr. J. W. Rockefeller, ; as their candidate for the posi, tion of representative. ( He is a, man of the highest integrity and ;, one of whom not even his political j, enemies can speak evil. Be is j, precisely the sort of a man whom j, the people of Colorado, ought to|, .welcome to their legislature at the:, present time, a man who could and, would do a great deal towards ref, pairing tho unfortunate condition, into which our state affairs have, fallen through fusion, incompcj, tenco and negligence. It is too, -. seldom that men of Rockefeller’s, standing can be induced to par#, ticipate in public affairs, and a, failure to secure liis election would, be a real loss to the public., The Salvation Army has re, ceived a gold medal at the Paris, Kxposition for its American ex, hibit, showing its methods in re, claiming the fallen and outcast., Dan. M’Donald Injured., Daniel McDonald, one of tho, oldept and most popular miners of, this district, narrowly escaped, death in an accident that occurred, at the Bon Ton mine in Crystal, basin Sunday morning, where he, lias been working with his partner,, Tom Lamor, of Marble. Two, rucks fell from overhead, from a, place he had just sounded a short, time before and thought safe. He, was struck upon the right side of, the head and his lower jaw badly, broken and n number of teeth, knocked out. He was also .in, jured in the chest. In view of the, nature of the accident, Dan de, clares it to be a miracle that he, was not killed. Medical attend, ance was immediately summoned, and the bones set and tho wounds, dressed. Ho was brought to town, Monday and is comfortably en, sconced at tho Elk Mt. House., Recovery will necessarily be slow, and tedious, as he will not bo able, to take solid food for six weeks. It, is a source of much gratification, to all to know that his injuries ure, not dangerous., Mike Enright Suicides., Last Wednesday morning at I, about ten o’clock Mike Kuright, a j, well known and popular man of I, middle age, who has divided his], time of residenceln Crested Butte!, between rock mining at a number!, of different mines and tending bar;, j for several of our saloons, coni, j mitted suicide in a rear room in, \' Bruce’s saloon by firing a shot, j from a H8-calibre Colt\'s revolver, into his head over tho right ear., Death was instantaneous., Enright had been up all night, and an hour or so before had re, tired to a rear room to sleep., The report of the shot was heard, by a crowd in the saloon at the, time it was fired, but it was, so muffied that it was thought to, ! have come from a bullet carelessly, j thrown in the stove. It was an, , hour afterward before the body, was found., Nothing was disturbed until the, arrival of Coroner John W. Eng, land, who decided, upon examina, tion, that it was a plain Case of, suicide, as the weapon was found, j grasped in the right hand of En, 1 rij*ht. He accordingly declared an, ’ inquest to be unnecessary., The motive for the dded is un, known, unless it be that his losses, of some $100 at the gaming 1able, [drove him to tho desperate deed., Tho body was embalmed by LTn, dertaker Miller and shipped on, j Friday to the family homo, [ at Galena, Mo., for burial.

I want to call your attention, to some facts that are self-evident., We are going to have another govern, or, and when the record of the differ, ent executive departments of the state, of Colorado are opened to the eyes of, the people of the state, they will find, some very curious reading. They will, find that we are slow in learning, but, will be slow\' to forget., •‘During Governor Routt’s adminis, tration in 1891-2 there was a surplus, of revenues in Colorado of a very mod, erate amount. In Governor Waite’s, administration in 1893-4 there was a, deficit of approximately $175,000. Dur, ing Governor Mclntyre’s administra, tion in 1895-0 the surplus was over, $50,000. During Governor Adams’ ad, ministration in 1897-8 there was a ss(>,-, 000 surplus. During the present ad, ministration there will be a deficit of, approximately $500,000. This will be, lowered somewhat by the fees obtain, ed from tiling articles of incorporation, in tntr omeu or me secretary or s;at**,, and the correct amount at the end of, the present administration will be, about $475,000., “As a result of Governor Thomas’, administration our stat* institutions,, which are the pride of our state, and, some of them are becoming the pride, of our whole country and known all, over the world, have had to borrow, money at the banks to keep them run, ning. In order to reach this extra ex, pense, but not in any degree to lessen, our expense, he appointed a committee, of undisciplined and indiscreet people, to devise away, not for cutting down, the ex pease, but whereby the- people, of the Halite pay additional taxes to, the amount of $500,000.

The deal was first discussed In, detail between Mr. Croker and William, J. Stone when the latter spent a week, ur ten days in New York a month ago., 2. Mr. Stone reported Mr. Croker’s, terms to .Mr. Bryan at a meeting in, Chicago attended by Chairman Jones, and Committeemen Johnson and Cam, pa u., 3. Upon his return to this city with, Mr. Bryan’s approval of the deal Mr., Stone opened national headquarters, here and Mr. Croker began to raise a, campaign fund and talk for Mr. Bryan., 4. Mr. Croker lias promised to carry, New York for Mr. Bryan. To do it he, lias agreed to raise a campaign fund, of $2,000,000, and lie has promised to, give SIOO,OOO in cash to tlie Democratic, national committee., 5. On his side, Mr, Croker is to re, ceive tlie control of all federal patron, age in New York City, and he lias tlie, promise of the secretaryship of the, navy for ills bosom friend, former Sen, ator Murphy, in the event of Mr. Bry, an’s election., 0. The sole cause of Mr. Croker’s, recent zeal for Mr. Bryan’s election is, the promise he lias received of federal, patronage In case of the latter’s elec, tion., U a man knew nothing of the facts, eeh at Greeley, October sth.), In the deal between Messrs. Croker and, JJryan lie would nevertheless have, little difficulty in making up Ids mind, about tlie existence of such a deal from, tlie change tiiot luva ooiuc orei-• Che po, litical situation here in the last few, weeks., FROM ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY, ACRES., Comparison of Prices Received for tin-, Same yuantltles of Farm Product* In, 1800 and 1900., Mr. William Jennings Bryan, the, Popo-Democratic candidate for tin*, presidency, insists that the farmers of, the United States have not derived any, benefit from the existing prosperity., A Nebraska farmer proves that Mr., Bryan is wrong.

Cable lines, across the Pacific are being discussed., Advocates of a government line are, figuring on two routes. The southern,, byway of Honolulu from San Francis, co to Manila and Guam, would, it is, calculated, cost about $13,500,000., It Is thought that the northern route, byway of Alaska to the Philippines,, and in ndldtlon thereto a separate line, from California to Hawaii, could bo, laid f<tf about $12,000,000., This difference in cost is largely due, to difference in length of the links. Tlie, arguments against such a route are to, Ik? found in the great natural difficul, ties to be encountered—ice. fog and, great depths, but a cable on the north, ern route 1 could be repaired at any, time of the year on any link, except, during temporary storms, and tlie ca, ble ship could always find a harbor, within 100 miles of any break. By the, northern route the different stretches, vary but slightly in distance, and are, all comparatively short, none exceed, ing 850 mil. s, so that, in case of a, break, one cable ship, if it were found, Impossible to make repairs, could easily, relay one entire stretch, the cost of, which would not amount to more than, $600,000, On the southern route, with its four, great stretches of 2,286, 1.254. 2,593,, and 1,496 miles, the cost of a break in, great depth. In ease repair were pos, sible, would probably amount to sev, eral hundred thousand dollors, with tlie, likelihood also of a necessity for tlie, renewal of an entire stretch, which, would cost from $2,000,000 to $3,000,-, 000., Another consideration is the supply, of gutta percha, which has become so, scarce and its price consequently so, high that its use in construction of, long-distance cables lias become very, costly. Gutta perclia costs $2 a pound;, rubber can be bad at $1.30. For long, stretches of 2.000 miles or more gutta, perclia, however, is requisite as insu, lating material, while for shorter, stretches India rubber suffices., The question of Pacific cable com, munication will tie one of tho foremost, ones concerning the United States in, the first years of the twentieth century., —Mining and Scientific ITess., What Will Become of China., None can foresee the outcome of the, quarrel between foreign powers over, the division of China.
