A frightful ac\ncident, which will result In the \'death of -12\nor 14 men, occurred \'ate this evening \'\nin the "subway" at One Hundred and\nNinety-fifth street and Broadway. At .\nmidnight six men, two of them dead,\nhad been removed from the tunnel. It\nis believed that 12 others were In the\nshbway when the accident occurred and\nthat all have perished.\nA colored man employed on the work\nwas the only eye-witness to the dis\naster, and his story ia the only one ob\ntainable. He statea that an electrician\nhad gone Into the mouth of the tunnel\nfor the purpose of stringing wires, and\nthat the man was followed by 17 or IS\nItalian laborers. Scarcely had the men\nentered the subway when three blasts\nwere heard, followed by a rumbling\nsound and.the falling ;f rock. The men\nwere caught beneath the falling mass\nand all but four of them were doubtless\nkilled. .\'-,.. \'\'\nOf the six men who had been taken\nfrom the subway nt midnight, two weres\ndead and four, were severely Injured.\nThe dead bodies of two other men were\nlying In plain view, with great rocks\nupon them. It Is thought that 10 other\nmen were crushed beneath the mass of\nstone, and there la little hope that they\nwill be taken out alive.\nThe accident probably resulted\nfrom a premature explosion, or may t\nhave been due to failure to give warn-\nlng of the blasts that were set off at the\ntime the men entered the tunnel.

The\n\' line from the buoy ataton to the O. R.\nft N. dock and in front of the upper As\ntoria mills runs a somewhat ilgsag\ncourse and la for the most part In shal\nlow water. In many places the water\nis only 14. 15 and IS feet at the extreme\nouter limit for dock building. ThU la\na serious handicap for the mills that\nwould engage In foreign shipping. In\nfact. It Is prohibitive bo far as upper\ntown mills are concerned since vessels\nfor the foreign trade are not being\nchartered on account of the lighterage\ncharges. This is a situation not to be\noverlooked In considering a change of\nthe harbor line. The success of tha\nmills and lumber factories we now\nhaw \'means the establishment of more.\nIf one mill can do a profitable export\nbusiness, others can. and every foreign\nship loaded here means the expenditure\ndirect of $1500 to J2500, aside from the\nmaintenance of the mills with their reg\nular employes. It Is not contended that\nthe harbor line should be disturbed at\nany one point of the port to the detri\nment of another point, but the present\ndemand by new commerce for a change\nIs of such Importance to the business in\ntnwts of the town that it de-servos\nmost serious consideration. The proper\nstep was taken by the Chamber of\nCommerce in asking for a new survey\nby government officials who should be\ncompetent to judge of the effects of a\nharbor line change. The chamber will\ndisc uss the matter at Its meeting Mon-\n\'day night, preliminary to the general\nmass meeting to be held at the Invita\ntion of Major iAngntt on the 4th of\nnext month.

"Bhe aurpaseea my ex\npectations In every respect and proved\nherself all that Is needed In this harbor.\nWhile my data Is nt sufficient to moke\nan exact statement aa to her speed, I\nbelieve she will easily go 10 knots an\nhour.

I believe that moderate\nprice will prevail some time daring\nthe coming year, and by waiting until\nthat time to put in our mill we can save\na big sum of money.
