President Taft, who has written\nseveral republican Senators\' sug\ngesting reservations to the peace\ntreaty which might be acceptable\nto both sides, has opened corres\npondence with prominent demo\ncratic Senators, including Hitch\ncock, one of the leading spokes\nmen of the administration.\nTaft\'s communication to Hitch\ncock was received today. It\nwas,\' not made public but is un\nderstood to be of the same gener\nal tenor as those sent to republi\ncans suggesting reservations or\ninterpretations to facilitate rati\nfication of the treaty.\nHitchcock and other leaders de\nclared today, however, that they\nwould continue their efforts for\nratification wihtout reservations,\'.\nThey, said they had no word from\nPresident; Wilson whether he will\nbe disposed to accept any inter\npretations but it is indicated the\nadministration would stoutly op\npose any qualifying clauses which\nwould require renegotiation of\nthe treaty. -\nThe suggestion has been re\nceived with earnest consideration\nby the group of republicans who\nfavor the idea and who already\nare at, work on a definite pro\ngramme of interpretative reser\nvations\' which they declare they\nhave reason to believe will be ac\ncepted by the administration.\nTo Neutralize Aland Islands\ntBy Associated Press)\nParis, July 24 The Baltic com\nmission of the peace conference\ntoday recommended that the\nAland Islands, between Sweden\nand Finland, be neutralized under\na guarantee of the League of Na\ntions.

Kash and\nmyself from the 9th Congressional District, to make a proper race\nfor the Railroad Commissionership under the peculiar existing cir\ncumstances\'. I find Mr. John B. Eversole, from 10th district which\nalready has a candidate for Secretary of State, asking that he re\nceive this Railroad Commission nomination. This\' is in spite of the\nfact that strong, capable and able 10th District Republican, the\nHonorable James W. Turner, of Paintsville, at Lexington, withdrew\nfrom the Railroad Commissioner\'s race in order that the Hon. Fred\nA. Vaughn, from the 10th District, could have the nomination for\nSecretary of State. Mr. Eversole is not equally fair. I think more\nof the 9th District and my friends\' and associates there, and of justice\nand fair treatment to my friends in the 9th District, than I do of\nthis office. I think it right to leave it to the Republicans of the\nRailroad Commissioner District to say whether the 9th District\nshall have representation or not. I therefore am withdrawing from\nfrom the race. \'\nVery Respectively,\nCLAY CISCO.\nAdv.-200-lt\nDEMOCRATS OF MADISON COUNTY\nChief Justice John D. Carroll, who seeks the Dem\nocratic nomination for Governor, is one of the ablest\nmen who has been a candidate in Kentucky in genera\ntions. He is clean, strong, forceful; he is a student\nand worker, not a politician.\nThere is nothing in his public or private life to ex\nplain or apologize for; as the party nominee he would\nnot be on the defensive.\nHe can unite the party; he can be elected.\nJudge Carroll will poll the full strength of the\nDemocratic party in Kentucky. Because of the full\nness of his qualifications, because of his high standing in\npublic and private life he will wrest from the Republi\ncan nominee the great mass of independent voters -which\ninvariably decides state elections in Kentucky.\nYou can not go wrong by VQting for Judge John D.\nCarroll for Governor. adv 201\nr\nWe Offer\nDUQUESNE LIGHT COMPANY\n(Pittabartb)\nFirst Mortgage Collateral Trust 67b1 Bond\nDue July 1, 1949\nPrice 100 and Intereet Yielding 6\nJames C.

Black made a splendid impres\nsion, and he had his audience with\nhim from start to finish. Gov. Black\nanswered every charge Judge Car\nroll could bring against him to the\nfullest satisfaction of all his friends\nand made himself much stronger\nby the clear-cut way in which he\nfrankly discussed the "famous" L. &\nN. letter andall "charges" against him.\nHe scored heavily on Judge Carroll\nwhen he proved how he had bolted\nGoebel back in 1899. In fact, Gov.\nBlack\'s reply to Carroll was a master\nly one in every way and will be read\nin full by his host of friends with\nkeen interest. He spoke as follows:\nGov.
