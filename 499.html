Wo believe that our\nchildren should be educated in its\nteachings, but that no dogma or\ncreed should be taugbt. At the\nsame time we believe that patriot*\nism, and love of country, should\nbe instilled into the hearts of our\nchildren and the sacred words of\n"mother, home and heaven." Our\nchildren should be taught that our\nflag is the symbol of all that makes\na home for us. Wo would place\na flag upon every public school in\nour land, and n Bible within aod\nthe object therein set forth should\nbe a beacon light in every storm\nwhich threatens to engulf us. We\nbelieve in freedom of speech, in\nfreedom at the ballotbox, in restricted\nimmigration, and in this\nnoble and patriotic work we ask\ni |> Art AV\\AHrtl\'/vM /* ^ I --A\niuo V/U-U|IUIUUUU Ul Ull ^(IUU Clll?\nzens.

The\nnearest counterpart to it, in mag\nnitude and duration is, according\nto The New York Sun, found\nin the fighting at bienzig. lust\ning live days. The land victories\nof tho Mikado\'s army are ipueh\nmora significant than the destruction\nof the war vessels of Russia,\nfor it strikes at the very vitals of\nthe Czar\'s power?at a point\nwhere it was supposed the Cossack\nwould bo hardest to overcome.\nThe capture of Liuo Yung, the\ndispatches state, will likely have\na bud effect upon the garrison at\nPort Arthur, which is now without\nhope of relief, siueo ocncral lvur\nopattun is put to it tosavo his own\narray. Liao Yang wus selected by\nthe general as his headquarters\nwhen the .Ispanoso began to get a\nfoothold upon the coast of Man huria.\nIt is about 300 miles from\nPort Arthur and midway between\nNew Chwang, the nearest port,\nabout 75 nailes distant, and Mukden,\nthe principal city of central\nManehuria. There the Russians\nhad established vast stores for the\nmaintenance cf their army, apparently\nregarding it as permanent\nheadquarters. The enfoacod ev?u\ncation of tho city, however, causfd\nthe stores to he destroyed.\nDesptte all their reverses, the\nRussian oHicers at St. Petersburg\ncomiiiiio 10 jmii on it ooni iron\',\nand assert that tn* movements are\nmerely a part of Gencrsl KuropaU\nkin\'s plan to withdraw inland and\nwear tho Japanese out by forcing\ntbetn to lengthen their lines of\nommunication. A study of the\nwapa will show how shallow this\nexplanation i?. The Japanese\nhas* it the sea, and from Line\nYang to the nearest port is less\nthan 100 miles, while tho city it\nMOl f is on tho Taitne river, navi\ngable for small gunboats. Then,\ntoo, the railroad to the sea doubtless\nfalls into the hands J*if the\nJapanese as fast as they advance,\nand this will ho the case for tlx\nentire breadth of Manchuria.\nTherefore, while the Japanese have\nto transport supplies some hundred\nmiles or so inland, the Uussian*\nmust bring theirs for many more\nmiles along the railroad\nIn explaining their revert oh at\nLuu> Yang die Russians make ,\nGeneral Stakolhorg, the ci in*\ntnunder of the Siberian Army\nCorps, numbering Home 25000\nmen, the scapegoat. It is asserted\nthat instead of obeying the orders\nhe received from General Kuropatkin,\nthe general placed his\nown interpretation upon them and\nhas ncen cnt*otf from the main\nbody in its flight northwari. It\nwould seem however, that the\nwhole Russian campaign has been\nouc series of blunders if their\ndefeats are to bo thus explained.\nWith the almost unprecedented\nfighting around Liao Yang, the\nOf cations at Port Arthur, some]\n300 miles to the southward, have\n- practically dropped out of sight\nI The latest news from there is that\nno further assaults have occured\n, during lhe past week, but that\nthe bombardment has to more or\n1 less extent been kept up. Since\n> the hope of relief has been cut otT\nJapan will likely content herself\nwith awaiting the natural fall of\nPort Arthur rather than resumI\nug the costly assault upon the\nfortification.\nAs a natural consequence of tho\nvictory won by Japan within tho\n1 past few days, there has been a\nrenewal of pence talk,but thore is\nnothing of a tangible nutnre to\n" bear out the idea that the matter\nof endeavoring to bring about a\ncessation of hostilities has ovon\nbeen seriously Honsidored by any\n1 of tho powers, and while Russia\nhas been severely dealt with she\nhas by no means boon whipped\nunless she should elect to tight\n1 the war with the present forces\nand not send any new troops to\n\' the field. IIor resources arc\ndoubtloss yet tremendous, and she\n\' will probably be able to continue\nthe light for a long time, even\nthough Japan\'s luck Iocs not\n1 turn. However, the issue as to\nwhether the Cossack ortheOrienshall\ndominate Eastern Asia is a\ngreat deal naerer settlement than\nal any timo since the war began, \'\nand there is only encouragement\nfor those who hope that the decision\nmay bo in favor of the little\nBrown luathen as against the\nwbito men who should be ongaged\nin better business.\nThere is a commercial feature\nin connection with this war which\nthe South is especially interested\nin, and that is as regards the demand\nfor cotton goods. It is believed\nthat the end of the war will\ntiring about an unusual demand\nfor American fabrics from Japan.\nBut tno most significant result in\nthis respect srould doubtless come\nin case of Japan\'s tinal > ictory\nover Russia. Then would the\nports of China be thrown open to\ntho trade of the Western world to\n>in extent that has only been\ndreamed of heretofore. It is not\nfor this reason, however, thatjtho\nsympathy of (treat Britain und\nAmerica are so strongly with the\nJap., but rather because it is bebelieved\nthat ho stands fo.* tho\nright against a domination that is\nnot countenanced by the advanced\nthought of tho Western world.?\nCharlotte Observer.\nA pyli.sician llculed |\nDr. Geo.
