that\npublicity is the best possible guaranty of merit and that the most intel I\nligent people generally want to know what they take into their stom\nI achs whether it be as food drink or medicine Although it was a bold\nstep to take and quite out of the usual practice of makers of proprie\ntary medicines yet Dr Pierce some time ago decided to publish broad\ncast and on all his bottlewrappers all the ingredients entering into the\ncomposition or makeup of his celebrated family medicines A square\ndeal is therefore assured every one using his medicines for one knows\nexactly what he or she is paying for when purchasing them since every\ningredient is published in plain English on the bottlewrappers and the\ncorrectness of the same attested under solemn oath These several ingredi\nents are selected from among the very best known to medical science\nfor the cure of the various diseases for which these medicines are\nrecommended\nThe most eminent and leading med\nical teachers and writers of all the\neeveral schools of practice have endorsed\neach of the ingredients entering into Dr\nPierces medicines in the strongest pos\niblrterras Th makers of Dr Pierces\nraeotclnes betiee

that\nthey cannot do harm in any case even\nto the most delicate woman or child By\nopen publicity Dr Pierce has taken his\nmedicines out of the list of secret nos\ntrums of doubtful merit and made\nthem REMEDIES OF KNOWN COMPO\nSITION They are therefore in a class\nall by themselves being absolutely and\nin every sense nonsecret\nBy this bold step Dr Pierce has shown\nthat his formulas are of such excellence\nthat he is not afraid to subject them to\nthe fullest scrutiny\nThere is a badge of Jionesty on every\nbottle of Dr Pierces medicines in the\nfull list of its ingredients duly attested\nas correct under solemn oath\nNo other medicines put up for general\nuse through druggists can make claim\nto any such distinction and none other\nthan Dr Pierces medicines have any\nsuch professional endorsement of their\ningredients Such professional endorse\nment should have far more weight with\nthe afflicted than anv amount of lay or\nnonprofessional endorsement or testi\nmonials\nOf course the exact proportion of\neach ingredient used in Dr Pierces\nmedicines as well as the working formula\nor manner of preparing the same and\nthe specially devised apparatus and ap\npliances employed in their manufacture\nare withheld from publicity that Dr\nPierces proprietary rights may be fully\nprotected from such unprincipled imi\ntators as might be piratically inclined\nThe preparation of these medicines\nwithout tlie use oi a drop of alcohol so\ngenerally employed and yet so harmful\nin the long run to most invalids when\nits use is long continued even in small\ndoses cost Dr Pierce several years of\ncareful study and labor with the aid of\nskilled pharmacists and chemists to\nassist him Naturally he does not care\nto give away his scientific and
