The Czarevitch\nbore the brunt of the fighting until 4\no\'clock, when Admiral Wlthoeft was\nhit by a shell, which blew his body to\npieces, only one of his legs being found\nafter tha explosion. Four officers\nstanding near him were also killed.\nAltogether the Czarevitch lost 15 men\nkilled and 45 wounded.\nAt 4 o\'clock in the afternoon of Au\ngust 11 a Russian torpedo boat destroy\ner, badly damaged, steamed slowly into\nTsingchou and half an hour later the\nprotected cruiser Novlk, slightly in\njured, entered port. No dead were on\nboard either vessel. They took coal\nand departed at 3 o\'clock on the morn\ning of August 12.\nThe battleship Czarevitch arrived at\nTsingchou on the night of August 11,\nsteaming at the rate of four knots an\nhour and burning immense quantities\nof coal to make even that rate of speed.\nHer rudder shaft was broken, one gun\ndisabled, lifeboats had been lost, her\nmasts were badly bent, her funnels\nwere riddled and her bridge had been\ntwisted out of position. The projectile\nholes above the water line were cov\nered with makeshift stoppers of wood.\nThe same night, August 11, the cruis\ner Askold, with 15 of her crew dead\nand 12 wounded, and one torpedo boat\ndestroyer attempted to enter Tsing\nchou, but were kept out by a Japanese\ncruiser, whereupon they proceeded to\nWoosung. The officers of the Czare\nvitch are of the opinion that the Jap\nanese vessels subsequently suffered se\nverely In the fighting, as the pursuit\nof the Czarevitch was maintained for\na short time only. The decks of the\nbattleship were slippery with blood\nand the men on board were almost\ndeaf as a result of the concussions of\nfiring.\nSeveral Japanese cruisers are report\ned to be off Shantung promontory near\nthe scene of the fighting, while the de\nstroyers are watching the mouth of\nTsingchou harbor.\nThe German warships at Tsingchou\nare the cruisers Fuerst Bismarck, Gei\nHansa and Hertha, the gunboats\nLuchs and Tiger and two torpedo boat\ndestroyers.

Underneath the Jollification\nof the populace libs a feelinf of deep\nsatisfaction and gratification at the dis\nposal of a desperately serious problem\nof the war. The Russian squadron\nwhich confronted Admiral Togo re\nfused battle. It Was stronger than Ad\nmiral Togo\'s squadron In battleships\nand armored cruisers, and had it elect\ned to fight the result might have alter\ned the fortunes of war. The strength\nof the squadron which opposed Ad\nmiral Togo compelled him to draw ves\nsels from the squadron under Vice Ad\nmiral Kamlmura.\nThe raid conducted by the Vladivo\nstok squadron in July was extremely\nexpensive to Japan, and not only was\nretaliation tempting, but it was de\nmanded by commercial interests. The\nnavy, however, grimly refused to make\na diversion and stuck to Port Arthur. It\nwas confident that the harbor soon\nwould be untenable for the Russian\nwarships; that it would eventually get\na fair fight in the open sea away from\nthe Russian land batteries and that\nthe Japanese would win. The calcula\ntions of the navy were correct, and the\nRussians, with the chances even, have\nbeen hopelessly defeated.\nControl Port Arthur.\nJapanese guns dominate the dock\nyards at Port Arthur, and, in view of\nthis fact, it would seem to be Impos\nsible to again make seaworthy or fight\nable the four Russian battleships which\nhave returned to Port Arthur. The\nbest possible naval force that Russia\ncan now concentrate at Vladivostok Is\nfour cruisers.\nCheefoo, Aug. 16.—A telegram Just\nreceived here from a reliable source\nstates that a general attack on Port\nArthur began at 4 o\'clock this morn\ning.\nSt. Petersburg.—There is a general\nbelief, which is borne out by the latest\ndispatches, that the situation at Port\nArthur is a desperate one. Apparently\nthe Japanese are concentrating all\ntheir energies toward the reduction of\nthe fortress ^n order to release heavy\nreinforcements for the operations\ngainst General Kuropatkin, and it Is\nthought that until this has been accom\nplished the advance on Liayang will be\nsuspended.\nThe St. Petersburg Boerse Gazette\nhas received the following dispatch\nfrom its Liayang correspondent:\n"Twelve Japanese regiments have\nleft in the direction of Port Arthur.\n"It is stated oh trustworthy author\nity that the mikado has ordered that\nPort Arthur must be taken at any cost,\neven if it necessitates the suspension\nof operations in Manchuria, and it is\nquite probable the main Japanese force\nwill proceed to Port Arthur within a\nfew days."\nHEIR TO RUSSIAN THRONE.\nSon Was Born and Czar Is Happy—All\nDoing Well.\nA son and heir to the Russian throne\nhas been born.\nThe empress and the baby czaro\nvltvh at last reports were in the best\nof condition.

A severe engage\nment is expected.\nA junk whioh haB arrived at Chefoo\nfrom Port Arthur reports that the Jap\nanese hare captured Fort Hanlungs\nhung, an important position a mile\nfrom the main fortress. Other junks\nwhioh arrived having left Port Arthur\nAugust 12, brought reports that the\nJapanese occupied new positions on\nthat day. The firing at Port Arthur\nwas heavy,but intermittent, and indi\ncated that the assaults were being con\ntinued. The Russians at Port Arthur\nare reported to be downhearted.\nAt SL Petersburg it is announced\nthat orders had been issued to the\noruiser division of the Russian Baltio\nsea squadron to sail for the far east. A\nportion of the fleet left Kronstadt at\nonoe and the remainder of the cruisers\nwill within 24 or 86 houia.\nThe exaot route whioh the vessels\nwill take has not been made known,\nbut it is believed they will go around\nthe Cape of Good Hope, ooaling from\nooiliers whioh will meet them enroute.\nThe battleships of the squadron will\nnot sail for a fortnight.\nAccording to a high official, the or\ndering of the squadron is beoause of\nthe depleted state of the Russian navy\noaused by the victories of Admirals\nTogo and Kamimura. With t the Port\nArthur fleet rendered practioally . use\nless, the Rurik sunk, the remaining\nvessels of the Vladivostok contingent\nlaid up for repairs, the czar\'s officials\nfeel that no time is to be lost in hurry\ning to the front to regaing, if, possible,\nsupremacy of the Pacific.\nThe emperor has received the follow\ning dispatch from Vioeroy Alexiefl:\n\'\'According to a "report from Port\nArthur August 11, the Japanese at\ntacked Taku and Siaohou mountains in\nenormous force during the night of\nAugust 10 and oooupied them after 15\nhonrs\'s fighting on the night of August\n15. During a heavy rainstorm the\nJapanese attacked our east front, but\nwere repulsed at all points.

The orew of\nthe battleship were alarmed at the ad\nvent of Captain Truppel\'s party and\nseized their weapons. They were quick\nly quieted, however, and the comman\nder of the Czarvitoh was informed that\nit was necessary that the Russian flag\nbe hauled down and remain down pend\ning the completion of the repairs.\nThe Czarev itch\'s flag was then low\nered amid impressive formalities, after\nwhioh Captain Truppel visited eaoh of\nthe trhee destroyers, whose flags were\nalso lowered.\nIt i s thought here that if the Rus\nsians persist in repairing their ships\nthey will eventually have to dismantle\nthem beoause of the vastly superior\nJapanese foroe whioh is waiting for\nthem eutside the harbor. According\nto the regulations whioh govern situa\ntions such as the one existing here, the\ndestroyers will not be permitted to\nleave in a body, but go out at intervals\nof six hours. It is believed here that\nthe Russian oruisers Pall ad a and Diana\nhave reaohed Vladivostok.\nSt. Petersburg—The Novoe Vremya\'s\nnaval expert, reviewing the incidents\nof the sea light of August 10, says:\n"Admiral Togo\'s first division sailed\nout of the Elliott islands or Talienwan\nand arrested Admiral Withoeft\'s pro\ngress, utilizing the enormous superior\nity of the Japanese in torepdo boats to\nattack the Russian vanguard and sow\ning floating mines in its course, a «trat\nagem hitherto unknown, whioh para\nlyzed Withoeft\'s movements, as it was\nalmost impossible to deteot the floating\nmines without stationing a lookout in\nthe bows, whioh necessitates exposing\nthe men to almost oertain death.

Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but\nalways under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.\nThey are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes\nall standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and\nbest of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.\nThe earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which ariseB from a knowledge of the benefits\nconferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest\nreward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of\nFigs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it giveB universal satisfaction, and therefore they\nare selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest\nremedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full\nname of the Company—California Fig Syrup Co.—printed on the front of every package.\nThey know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and\nof weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or\nover-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt apd beneficial in its effects as\nSyrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.\nOwing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the\nimmense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, Taut there are\nindividual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles\nof the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate\nto recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations\nsometimes have the name—" Syrup of Figs"—or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,\nor fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of\nthe Company—California Fig Syrup Co.—printed on the front of the package. The imitations\nshould tie rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations\nthey find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, find whenever a. dealer passes\noff on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which\ndoes not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,\nhe is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his\nestablishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and\nand deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of\nphysicians\' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.\nKnowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand\nfor our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every\nwhere, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions\nexist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return\nany imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company—\nCalifornia Fig Syrup Co.—printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the\narticle and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot\ndruggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.\nLYON\nBOARDING\nSCHOOL\nF O R\nBOYS.\nThorough instruction,\n\'«refill training and\n»verHight- every uafe\nguard; refining inti »\nencei; ideal location,\nunsurpassed for\nhealthfulnesu; experi\nenced teachers: pat\nronized by the best\ndas« of people.\nSend for circular.\n............re Collegiate, Prepare\ntory, Commercial and\nUniversity Courses.\nBoarding school tor young men and boys.\n*«* 322 University Park Station, Portland, Ore.\nApply for Catalogué.\nJOHN OdDEN ASSAY CO.\nGold, silver, copper or lead, $1 each.
