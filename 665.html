        <pre>['VOLUME 8. NUMBER 108.\nPEAT FIRES REPORTED\nBURNING NEAR SHOTLEY\nSchrader Says Flames are Spreading to\nTree TopsHomesteaders Timber\nin Danger.\nGuy Schrader, of Shotley, who\nis deputy United States marshal\nand also fire warden for his quart\ner, was in the city yesterday on\nhis way to attend a trial at Super\nior. He reported the fires as\nburning badly in the Shotley\ncountry, especially along the road\nfrom Shotley to Kelhher.\nMr. Schrader says that he thinks\nthe fire started by the Smith boys*\nburning the brush and stumps off\ntheir garden. The land there is\npeat formed by the decaying of\ntrees for centuries and once on fire\nis hard to put out. The farms are\non cut over land, and while the\nsoil is the finest kind for raising\ncrops, is so rich that when it once\ngets on fire it is impossible to get\nit out without the help of a good\nram.\nThe fire along the Shotley road\ncame above ground yesterday after\nnoon and was dangerous for about\nthree hours while the west wind was\nblowing. Mr. Schrader says that\nthe homesteaders in that section of\nthe county have cut their cedar and\nhave it piled ready for the skids,\nand that if it is burned, they will be\nruined financially.\nAt the present time, the fire is in\nland cut over by the Crookston and\nIrvine Lumber companies and is\nburning the slashings, \'in some\nplaces it has jumped up into the tree\ntops, but for the most part is on the\nground in the slashings and the peat.\nThe fire is burning south towards\nthe logs piled by the homesteaders.\nIf they once get on fire, the damage\nwill be grte*Kbut at present there is\nlittle loss. A meeting of the Wardens\nwill probably be held todaj/at Kelli\nher. Volunteers are wanted to go\ninto the peat and fight with the\nshovel.\nFire Ranger Grove came over from\nGrand Rapids yesterday and went\nnorth on the M. & I. with the ran\nger from Deer River. They expect\nto look over some fires reported in\nthe Deer River district. All fires\nreported are in the brush, the\ndanger lying in their spreading\nover nearby farms.\nTWIN CITIES DARK TODAY\nCurtain of Smoke Causes Fear There\nof Fires Here.\nBillows of smoke, which yester\nday da kened the sky almost to the\nblackness of night, had today rolled\non southward, enveloping St. Paul\nand Minneapolis where artificial\nlights are on in full force, even tb2\nstreet cars running behind blazing\nheadlights.\nThe forest fire phenomena so\nalarmed the Twin City newspapers\nover the safety of the northern part\nof the state that they called up\ndifferent towns, including Bemidji,\nunder the belief that the woods\nwere on fire.\nAs a matter of fact there are no\nserious fires within many miles of\nMinnesota, the curtain of smoke\nfloating across the continent from\nthe death and property destroying\nconflagations that are eating away\nthe forests at towns of Montana\nand Idaho.\nNarrowly Escapes Death.\nCass LakeAugust 23(Spe-\ncial to the Pioneer)Thomas\nGlidden had a narrow escape from\ndeath here today while at work as\nsisting in constructing a sewer.\nHe was engaged in the bottom of\nthe trench when without warning\nthe bank caved in on one side and\ncovered him with about four feet\nof sand. He fell in a crouching\nposition leavi a small air space\nunder his body which undoubtedly\nsaved his hfe. He was rescued in\nten minutes\' me and au examina\ntion of his injuries showed his hip\nand shoulder were bruised, caused\nby falling planks.\n"MP\n1\n1 I uuiMMWW\nTHE BEMIDJI\nSPORTING NOTES.\n1910 Football Guides.\nThree copies of the 1910 football\nguide were received Sunday by\nOliver Neilson at the Markham.\nThey now belong to Clarence Shan\nnon, Harold Dane and Mr. Neil\nson.

It tells of a\nsailor kidnapping a little girl and\nthrowing her into the ocean. She\nwas saved by a small boy and the\nsailor was finally captured after an\nexciting chase.

Woodmansee and Miss Hazel\nFellows. This illustrated song is\nmaking the biggest hit of them all.\nDon\'t miss seeing this entire feature\nbill at the Majestic.\nBeer Shipped to Minneapolis.\nAny one down to the depots last\nweek could have seen several ship\nments of beer to private consumers\nin Minneapolis and Red Wing. The\nbeer was shipped by the Bemidji\nBrewing company. The fact that it\nwas shipped to towns which have\nbreweries that make good beer goes\nto show that the local product has a\nwide reputation for its excellence.\npep\ns?-\nBIG MEN TO ADDRESS\nOLD SETTLERS MEETING\nHalvor Steenerson, Judge Stanton and\nJudge Spooner Selected by the\nCommittee.\nHalvor Steenerson, C. W. Stanton\nand M. A. Spooner have been\nselected by the committee in charge\nof the arrangements for Old\nSettlers day at the County Fair\nto address the association. The\nannual meeting will be held Thurs-\nday, September 15, at 2 p. m. and\nofficers for the coming year will be\nelected at that time.\nMr. Steenerson is at present the\ncongressman from this district and\nwill come up for re-election this\nfall. Judge Stanton was spoken of\nas a leader for the state democratic\nparty this fall but will be a candi\ndate for re-election as judge. Judge\nSpooner has served as judge and is\nnow engaged in private practice but\nhas been already spoken of as the\ncandidate in 1912 for chief justice of\nthe state supreme court. It is not\nimprobable that the speeches will\ncontain some interesting political\nmaterial.\nThe Old Settlers association is\npreparing for a big day. The Fair\nofficials have promised free admis\nsion to all wearing the old settlers\nbadges. Badges will be given mem\nbers when they pay their yearly dues\nof twenty-five cents and to new\nmembers when they pay the initia\ntion fee of fifty cents.\nThe executive committee of the\nassociation, consisting of President\nGeorge W. Wetzell, Secretary Henry\nStechman and Treasurer Earl Geil,\nmet in Bemidji Saturday and selected\nthe speakers. bs \'secretary.jEasJ.^\nappointed a committee of one to\nengage the speakers and arrange the\ndetails of the meeting.\nPresident Wetzell was appointed\na committee of one to procure the\nbadges necess \\ry.\nThe society his heen doing good\nwork in this part of the state and\nthose who are members now wish\nthat every old settler would take ad\nvantage of the annual meeting Fair\nweek and come into the association.\nCROOKSTON BEAR STORY\nBlack Animal Bites Chunk out of a\nPig\'s Neck.\nCrookston, August 23(Special\nto the Pioneer)The appearance of\nblack bears in this section has caused\nthe women in the rural districts con\nsiderable worry. Last week one\nwas killed at Beltrami and a second\nwas killed at Lockhart the day fol\nlowing. A number of others have\nbeen seen, and while none of them\nhave attempted to attack any one,\nthe fact they have not been seen\naround lately, except a stray one\nonce at long intervals, makes the\nsight of one rather terrifying.\nSunday at the home of T. Mor\nveau, northeast of the city in Louis\nville townships, a big black bear\nmade its appearance, Mrs. Morveau\nbeing attracted by the squealing of\na pig. She ran out and saw the\nbear in the pen. It seized a porker\nweighing over 100 pounds and\njumped over the pen with it.\nMrs. Morveau called to her hus\nband who ran to the house and\nsecured his rifle but could not\nfind a bullet for ipf However, he\nran after the anim il and hit it a\nterrific smash over the head. It\ndropped the pig, but tore a great\nchunk of flesh from the animal\'s\nneck. The bear got away.\nIn the town of Andover Saturday\nanother bear was shot just a few\nmiles from the city. The bears are\nall taking to the prairies because of\nthe brush fires in the timber country\nto the east, and the shortage of the\nberry crop makes them prey upon\nanything they get sight of. A bear\ncannot stand smoke, old cruisers\nstate, and take to their heels as soon\nas smoke from a fire reaches their\n55 V,\nJUDGE J. W. FINEHOUT.\nSt. Paul Jurist \'Who Sen\ntenced Banker to Workhouse.\nWATERMAN MUST\nSERVE SENTENCE\nBanker Guilty of Reckless Auto\nSpeedingLoses on AppeaL\nSt. Paul, Aug 23 Frank W. Water\nman, president of the Ramsey County\nState bank, who was sentenced to\nthirty days in the workhouse for reck\nless auto speeding by Judge John W.\nPmehout in police court last week,\nmust serve his time out, according to\na decision rendered by Judge 6. M.\nOrr in the district court.\nThe banklr had sued* out a writ of\nhabeas corpus from the sentence of\nJudge Finehout and he has been in\nthe custody of the sheriff since Satur\nday, when he was brought in from\nthe workhouse. In denying the writ\nJudge Orr decided it is not necessary\nto have a detailed complaint filed\nwhen trying cases in the police court\nThe attorneys for the banker at\nonce gave notice^ofjan appeal, both\n\'onTTIfe* decision On xne writ and the\nsentence of Judge Finehout. There\nis no provision for admitting Water\nman to bail pending action on the\nwrit by the supreme court and Judge\nFinehout refused to fix any bail in the\nappeal from the sentence imposed by\nhimself.\nCANNON IN "BAD FIX",\nDECLARES VOLSTEAD\nUncle Joe Fighting for Seat Rather\nThan Speakership, Says Con-\ngressman Here.\nCannon never again will be\nelected speaker of the national house\nof representatives," said Congress\nman A. J. Volstead of Granite Falls,\nwho spent last night in Bemidji.\n"Uncle Joe is in a bad fix," con\ntinued Mr. Volstead, "for he has\nlost his prestige with both factions\nof the republican party. His stub\nborn stand at the last Congress when\nhis scalp was ia jeopardy did\nnot please even the regulars who\nthought the old Illinois warrior\nshould agree to a compromise in be\nhalf of party harmony.\n"As a result \'many of those who\nwere his closest friends became\nbitter against him and remain\nbitter to this day.\n"As a matter of fact what Uncle\nis fightingffor is his seat in Congress,\nnot the speakership. He knows\nthat unless he tells his constituents\nof the Danville district that he in\ntends to continue as speaker that\nthey will fail to return him to Con\ngress at all. It is pretty well under\nstood that the power of the stern old\nfighter has faded, never to blossom\nagain."\nMr. Volstead is the only congress\nman in the state who will not be op\nposed for reelection. He is from\nthe Seventh district and neither\ndemocrat nor republican there has\nas yet dared to make the race again\nhim.\nMr. Volstead was not anxious\nto talk politics but did tajk with\nout hesitancy regarding the depos\ned speaker. Of the tariff, Taft\nRoosevelt alleged tilt and other\npolitical issues he was silent. He\npredicted a republican victory\nthis fall, all along the line, from\nthe state ticket to the make up of\nthe next Congress. He hopes to\nattend the conservation congress\nat St. Paul during the week of\nSept. 5.\nBEMIDJI, MINNESOTA, TUESDAY EVENING, AUGUST 23, 1910. TEN CENTS PER WEEK.\nGROSSING OF THIRD AND\nBELTRAMI TO BE PAVED\nCouncil Orders Storm Sewer Laid For\nTwo BlocksCity Prisoners\nMust Work.\nAfter some discussion last night,\nthe city council and City Engineer\nStoner came to an agreement on the\nquestion of paving the intersection\nof third street and Beltrami avenue\nand at the same time providing for a\nstorm sewer. The intersection is to\nbe laid after the paving on the two\nThird street blocks is finished. In\nthe meantime, the sewer will be laid\nacross the intersection.\nAccording to the plan of the en\ngineer, the sewer will run down Bel\ntrami avenue to Second street and\nover Second street to the outlet.\nOnly these two blocks will be put\ndown at the present time and they\nwill care for the surplus water that\nwill run off the pavment. As the\nsewer does not have to be water\ntight, second grade pipe will be used.\nSpecifications are to be drawn up at\nonce and bids advertised.\nMr. Stoner also reported that\ntwelve lots on Third street had\nnot yet made their sewer connections\nand that he advised the city to\nput the conditions in and assess\nthe cost against the lots. As one\nconnection can serve for two lots,\nfive will be installed. These will\ncost about $30 each. The engineer\nwas instructed to proceed with the\nwork. The lots affected are 3, 5,\nand 6, in block 18 4 in block 17\nand 13, 14,15, 16, and 17, in block\n18.\nSoo Matters Up Again.\nMonte Brown, appearing for the\nSoo railroad, asked that commis\nsioners be appointed to make the\nawards for the vacation of certain\nstreets for the Soo. On July 18,\nthe council heard the petition of\nvacation and ordered to set for\nhearing last night. No opposition\nwas apparent and the council ap\npointed the old commissioners to\nmake the awards. The commis\nsioners are Mayor Parker, P. M.\nDiciare, George McTaggart,\nGeorge French, and S. C. Bailey.\nMayor Parker read a letter from\nPresident Pennington, of the Soo,\nstating that he had ordered the\nchief engineer to put a viaduct over\nthe Soo at the Irvine avenue cros\nsing. Mayor Parker pointed out\nthat unless a new viaduct was built\nto go over both the Soo and the\nGreat Northern tracks, that teams\nwould have to haul over one and\nthen over the other, there being\nthirty feet between the two. The\nmatter is to be taken up with the\nSoo and Great Northern roads this\nweek.\nImprovements (or Streets and Parks.\nA report from the park committee\nwas read in which it was advised\nthat the old tree stumps be taken\nout of the parks and new trees set\nout where needed. It also advised\nthat the boulevard road along the\nlake in front of the hospital and\nthe Otto residence be straightened\nby the removal of seveial trees. The\nreport was accepted and filed.\nBrandborg\'s new addition to the\ncity was not accepted but left to the\nstreet committee for a report next\nMonday night. It was understood\nthat Ross is to plat some lands west\nof the city and the engineer was in\nstructed to run twenty-third street\nwest to Anderson\'s corner before\nthe lots were cut up.\nThe street committee reported\nthat Park avenue could not be\nopened without a jog in it some\nplace and it then became a quest\nion where to have the jog. No\naction was taken last night and\nthe matter was put off for a week.\nStoner\'s report on the new wat\ner main to go in on Mississippi\nand Oak streets was accepted and\nfilled. Specification will be drawn\nup at once and bids advertised.\nIt was ordered to install at once a\nnew sidewalk on Beltrami avenue\nbetween Eleventh and Thirteenth\nstreets.

Half of the town of\nWallace is swept clean, and there is\na possibility that two or three more\ntowns in the district have suffered\ncomplete destruction.\nHalf a dozen small towns and\nvillages are seriously threatened and\ntheir inhabitants are hurrying to\nplaces of safety by the thousands.\nThe situation is most acute in the\nCouer d\'Alene district of northern\nIdaho.\nSome of the fires have been\ncontrolled,, others are less threat\nening in absence of wind, while\nin some districts the fire fighters\nhave diverted the course of the\nflames from towns that were\nthreatened. JURY VERDICT HANDED INposed\nCannot be Opened Until The Judge\nReturns From Bemidji.\nBagley, August 23 (Special\nphone message at 2 p. m.)The jury\nin the Warren-Kolb case has brought\nin a verdict. The judge is in Bemidji\nand will not return until 4:23 this\nafternoon. It is rumored about the\ncity that the verdict is favorable to\nthe plaintiff.\nMore Whiskey Confiscated.\nN. A. Way, deputy Indian agent,\ncame in last night and this morn\ning said that Friday night he had\nconfiscated forty-five gallons of\nwhisky and twelve cases of beer\nwhich were being hauled into Park\nRapids in a wagon driven by N. V.\nSpenser. Mr. Way said, "I have\ntraced this shipment to Bemidji and\nknow\' the saloon which sold the\nwhiskey. Say for me that Bemidji\nwill soon be in dry territory if this\nkind of business is not stopped at\nonce.

T. J. Burke, W.\nG. Schroeder and L. F. Johnson\nwere appointed as a committee to\nemploy counsel aud ascertain the\nexact status of the ditch propos?t\nion.\nCongressman A. J. Volstead, of\nGranite Falls, father of the feder\nal drainage act, was present and\nexplained the bill which he caused\nto become a law. He was enthu\nsiastically received, although it is\nthe wide limitations of his act\nwhich caused the meeting to as\nsemble.\nA. G. Wedge, president of the\nCommercial club, presided and in\ncalling the meeting to order ex\nplained the dangers of unrestricted\nditch building so long as the county\nmay be called upon to pay the\nassessments on unsettled land.\nW. G. Schroeder sounded the key\nnote of meeting when he said:\n"We all believe in ditches, but I\nfor one don\'t believe in draining\none peat bog into another peat bog\nand charging the cost up to the\ncounty."\nOn the other hand, A. A. An\ndrews, who frankly admittedjuthat\nhe was attorney for the ditch\npetitioners in all but a few ditches,\nfought hard against the wave of\nopposition which threatens to make\nseveral of the ditches impossible,\nand sparred for time by asking that\na representative of his side of the\ncontroversy be named as a member\nof the investigating committee, but\nbe plead in vain.\nAttorney E. E. McDonald also\'\nurged great caution in tne attempt\nto prevent the construction of the\ncanals and pointed out the benefits\nthat might accrue.\nC. A. Asby, a settler from the\naffected district, said he thought\nmost all of the land along the pro\ndrains would be taken up,\nthat there were a good many settlers\nin that district and that the county\nwould not suffer if the proposed pro\njects were completed.\n"This county already has a bonded\nindebtedness of $300,000 and I\nthink it the height of folly to place\nit in jeopardy of more than double\nthat amount" said T. J. Burke.\nM. D. Stoner, city engineer, said:\n"it seems to me that what we\nwant is to favor the building of roads\nfor to build a road means that the\nland must be drained and where\nroads can not be constructed I doubt\nthe value of ditches. When roads\nare possible we reclaim the land and\nconnect communities."\nMr. Burke moved that an investi\ngating committee be appointed and\nthis was seconded by Mr. Schroeder.\nW. L. Brooks made the point that\ncounsel, "the best we can get,"\nshould be employed and that there\nnecessarily would be some expense\nattached. It was taken as the sense\nof meeting that the committee be\nempowered to proceed as it sees fit.\nThis committee will begin its work\nat once at once and hand in its re\nport at the earliest moment\nIn addressing the meeting Con\ngressman Volstead said:\n"I am not here to tell you where\nyou should construct ditches. That\nis a proposition that you must settle\nin a clear business like way for your\nself. This act became a law after\nlong discussion and much investiga\ntion. It is my opinion that most\nall of this drained land will be taken\nup by homesteaders, but if not it can\nbetaken up and sold."\nSL-/**\n3L\ns*\nK. i*\nFree stone peaches at Roe and\nMarkusen 85 cents a crate.', '.&&\n$%M\nTHE BEMIDJI DAILY PIONEER\nPOIUIIIED ETHT AFTHR9HI ttm SMUT IV\nTHE BEMIDJI PIONEER PUBLISHING CO.\nE.

He was born in\nan era when his type was the politi\ncal hero, when material achievement\nwas the first virtue., Press, maga\nzine and pulpit, which now see in\npersonal wealth suspicion of crime,\nthen praised the "Captain of Indus\ntry it was a term of laudation, not\nof reproach.
