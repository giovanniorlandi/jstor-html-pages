Den\nton, Scotchman, In Juarez, Mex., may\nhe made the occasion of demands\nupon the United States to take somo\naction in Mexico is regarded in Wash\nington as quite probable. It is not\nseen, however, Just whut there Is that\nthe United States can do in the mat\nter now that Denton Is dead.\nThere .Is no disposition In well\ninformed 1 ouarters to believe that\nGreat Britain will venture anything\ndrastic or press the United States to\nan uncomfortable degree as a result\nof the Denton case.\nIt Is regarded as likely, however,\nthat the Incident may stir up bad feel\ning in England and Europe and result\nIn Increased pressure on the United\nStates in favor of American interven\ntion in Mexico.\nThe United States government will\nhave the keenest Interest In whatever\ncourse the British government decides\nupon when informed of the killing of\nBenton.\nOfficial notice of the death of Benton\nwas received by Secretary Bryan In\ndispatches from Consul Edwards nt\nJuarez.

Whether the\nman was shot by Villa as he lay on\nthe floor or was later executed by\norder of the rebel court-martial, as\nofficially stated by rebel\' officers, Is\nnot positively known.\nA Mexican man who -was present\nwith- several -others 1n Villa\'s ofllces\nwhen the. difficulty occurred between\nthe Rritish nltlzen and the rebel chief\ntells-the story.\nVilla related his version of the story\nto American Consul Edwards at a con\nference In the American consulate at\nJuarez and a few hours later the rebel\nleader hurried south to Cliihuuhua In\na special train.\nCastillo Fears Assassination.\nHundreds of persons crowded the\nvacant space in front of the depot at\nEl Paso, Tex., when the train arrived\nfrom Haclilta, N.

This provided for the\nextension of the privilege of free pas\nsage to coastwise vessels of all\nnations. In other words to Canadian\nvessels plying between east and west\ncoasts of Canada and to the South\nAmerican countries.\nThe president disclosed the fact tlmt\nalthough the compromise had not been\nbrought to his attention for serious\nconsideration he viewed It as embody\ning a discrimination against the tax\npayers of the United States, because\nthey would really bear the burden ot\nfurnishing free passage to the coast\nwise ships of the world.\nIn this connection the president\nmade it clear that his advocacy of the\nfree tolls proposition Is not grounded\non the belief that it Involves n viola\ntion of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, hut\nbecause It confers a special privilege\non certain interests at the expense ot\nthe whole people.\nProbe Asked of "Wheat Price Pool."\nImiulry Into the organization and\noperations of the Chicago and Dulutli\nhoards of trade and the Minneapolis\nchamber of commerce to determine\ntheir influence over wheat and flout\nprices in the country was proposed\nin a resolution Introduced In the house\nhy Representative Manahan of Mlnne\nsota.\nThe resolution was referred to the\nrules committee and Representative\nManahan announced his Intention ol\npressing for a hearing before that com\nmittee nt the earliest possible date.\n"The cost of living has not respond\ned to the general reduction In tariff\nrates," declared the preamble to the\nresolution, "and does not yield to the\nsteadily falling prices received by\nfanners for their products.

Just wby tbe\nDemocratic department at Washington\ndid not make an appointment from tbe\nlist of applicants at the last examination\nis somewhat of a puzzle to tbe good peo\nple who patronize that office, as it Is\nknown that at least one exceptionally\nworthy applicant passed an almost fault\nlesa examination mentally, and aa to\nmoral and physical requirements, If these\ncount for anything, the applicant would\nalso mark up close to tbe hundred per\ncent mark.

Bear in mind that the office at\nWest Hickory is in tbe civil service class,\nbut it must also be remembered tbat tbla\nis a bourbon administration, with which\nthe mere matter of ability and moral\nworth count fur little as against political\npredilections.\nA Dangerous Plan.\nWe bope Congressman Hulings, of tbla\ndistrict, will take the time to ascertain, as\nearly as possible, exactly what the Presi\ndent and bis advisers propose to do in tbe\nmatter of assuming Federal control over\nthe building of dams and tbe water power\nof the country. The plan, as published\nin tbe newspaper.\', includes what appears\nto be a scbeme of tbe people wbo wish to\ngrab tbe watei power of tbe slates and\nto eodauger human lile and tbe property\nof tbe public, to get at Washington what\ntbey cannot get at Harrisburg or other\nstale capitols. Itlssiid tbat tbe Presi\ndent plans to tave tbe War Department\nissue permits to use tbe streams and erect\ndams, grsnling to corporationa organized\nunder tbe laws ol states wbere the dams\nare to be built or tbe water power used.\nIt may easily happen that perfectly le\ngal corporation may thus be empowered\nto erect damson the headwaters, and else\nwhere, of Pennsylvania streams. Tbe\nconstitutional right of tbe Government at\nWssbiugton to assume tbe power tbua\nspoken of as an administration plau we\nseriously doubt. Tbe Supreme Court ol\ntbe United States bas, by continual usurp\nation, as we understand it, taken contrul\nof interior waters, beginning by taking\nIt as part of the harbors and coast line\nand gradually going op tbe streams to\nevery lake and navigable creek, but tbat\nthe Government can assume to say what\ndams shall be constructed in Pennsylva\nnia does not appear Irom anything we\nbave noticed in tbe fundamental law of\nthe land. Tbe Secretary of War says tbe\nGovernment has a right under tbe clause\ngiving it power to control navigation.\nTbe Socialists will bail tbis decision with\njoy. II the Government baa power un\nder the constitution to build dams and\nu -e water power, or delegate the right.\nthen it bas also, as part of tbe contn I of\nnavigation, the further right to make cot\nton cloth, or delegate the right, and all\nmanufactured articles, as a part of tbe\ncontrol of navigation. It is no more ab\nsurd to say tbat tbe power to control\nnavigation includes tbe right to control\ntbe making of gingham aprons and the\nproduction of electricity than it is to aay\nthat the clause in the constitution gives\nthe Administration or the National Gov\nernment power to obstruct navigation\nunder pretense of controlling it. Tbe\nwhole plan appears dangerous not only\nto the lives and property of tbe publio,\nbut to the rights of tbe people in eacli\nstate to decide for themselves what shall\nbe done with public waters.

In business we find that you cannot afford to take chances on qualities.\nFor instance, we could buy pretty good merchandise at far less than we are now paying,\nand sell it for the same prices that we are now getting, but it is not the best. We won\'t con\nsider buying or selling any goods whatever where the quality is questionable. We know who\nmakes the best, and that\'s where we buy it.\nHERE\'S PROOF. We sold every Fancy Winter Suit in our store two weeks ago.\nIf we wanted to be unfair we had opportunities to buy hundreds of suits at bargain prices.\nWe could have bought them, sold them, and made money, but the people who have made\nour success possible would have been imposed on, and the little profit we\'d make would be\nmighty costly. You can\'t throw sand in the public eye, and get away with it. We don\'t pro\npose at any time to even try it.\nJ\nI.\nA.\n1\ni\'\nOil City, Pa.\nOil City, Pa.\nChicago Aviator Wiio Flans\nto Fly Across Ocean\nitjli\nPhoto by American Press Amiociatlon.\nHarold f.

This is particularly true\nof wool, sales of which continue lare\nat advancing prices.
