        <pre>['AMERICAN\n<\nVOLUME VIIINO 9 LOUISVILLE SATURDAY MARCH 1 1902 PRICE FIVE CENTS\nROBERT EMMET 1\nAnniversary of Irelands Young\nL Martyr Patriot on\nMarch 4\nHistorical Sketch of Conditions\nand Events of His\nTime\nHis Undying Devotion and Ef\nforts For Ills Countrys\nLiberty\nMEMORABLE SPEECH AT HIS TRIAL\nOn March 4 the anniversary of Robert\nEmmet every true Irish beart will thrill\nwith admiration of Irelands martyr\npatriot and indignation for his murderers\nand their countrys oppressor proving\nthat the cause for which Emmet died\nstill lives as fresh and ardent as a cen\ntury ago To every Irishman the life of\nEmmet is familiar We give a sketch of\nthe conditions and events of his last\neffort in behalf of his country\nThe concessions grudgingly given\nIreland were nullified when the fear of\nFrench invasion grew less and the little\ndifficulty with the United States was\nsettled Ireland must cease to be a\nnation must become a province a shire\nof Englandand for that purpose the\npeople were goaded into rebellion that\nthe late concessions might be withdrawn\nand the way made clear for the extinc\ntion of the Irish nationality\nBut the eloquence of Grattan and his\nlittle band of followers had not been\nwithout bearing fruit During the\ndecades which had seen the great parlia\nmentary debates the rise of the volun\nteers the compulsion of England the\nliberation and growth of Irish industry\nthe increase and contentment of the\npopulation there had come to the front a\nyoung Ireland which looked on all this\nas only the stepping stone to a high\nplane of public and national life These\nwere the United Irishmen as brave and\ndisinterested a body of patriots as ever\nconspired for their countrys freedom\nmen ofevery class in Ireland from the\ngreat ducal families down to the plain I\nand honest tradesmen and the tillers of\nthe soil They were not originally a\nsecret society but the virulent cruelty of\nthe castle and the malignant hate of\nEnglish statesmen drove them to the\npatriots last resource the secret plotting\nand the armed rising\nThey had enrolled half a million mem\nbers and had provided rude arms for\nsome 300000 They were able to interest\nboth France and Holland for three years\nin their projects They had behind\nthem ninetenths of Ireland deprived yet\nof perfect religious equality and smart\ning under political disabilities and the\nsocial and economical injustices of many\ncenturies standing The immemorial\nsign of the national independence the\nParliament was tottering to its fall the\nexertions of Tone the expedition of\nHoche its sad failure the reprisals on\nthe unfortunate peasantry the excesses\nof the soldiery the rising of 98 and the\nfinal repression of the illtimed and ill\nstarred movement which 1 cost England\nan enormous treasure that Ireland had to\nrepay and took over 100000 men for the\ntask of repressing a very partial insurrec\ntion in a portion of the island Then\ncame the unholy and unhappy union of\nthe Parliaments of two kingdoms\nThe Irish Parliament was dissolved\nforever Iii 1801 and an institution that\nwent back to the Feis of Tara ceased\nits immemorial career\nIt was into this Ireland of the closing\neighteenth century that Robert Emmet\nwas born the youngest son of a patriotic\nand distinguished physician and the\nbrother of Thomas Addis Emmet one of\nthe most active of the United Irishmen\nTrinity College did not extinguish the\naspirations of the younger Emmets soul\non the contrary the time he saved from\ngrave study was devoted to the history of\nhis country to plans for the betterment\nof her condition and his ardent proselyt\nism for justice and equality led to his\nexpulsion from the college By birth\nand family connection he might have\naspired to the highest gifts in the power\nof the English State but he preferred to\nshare his countrys sufferings and at the\nvery outlet cast his lot with those who\nmeditated her formal independence\nThe public reprisals of the Govern I\nment ended with the imprisonment\nand later with the exile of the chief\nleaders prominent among whom was\nThomas Addis the brother of Robert\nEmmet In the fall of 1802 the two\nbrothers met on the continent where the\nexiles of 1798 were organizing a last\neffort to effect the independence of the\nGreen Isle From the society of the\nexiles and the continental diplomats\nRobert Enimet returned glowing with\nenthusiasm filled with hope and em\nployed the first six months of 1803 in\nsetting on foot a last army of resistance\nto the English conqueror lIe threw\ninto the movement indomitable energy\nand a persistent vigor He was omni\npresent and by discourse example and\nwriting roused again the drooping spirits\nof those men who found the irons of\nslavery worse than the fetters of the\ngrave Wltbl incredible ingenuity and\nboldMM lie began to construct weapons\nand ammunition of war and under\nshadow of the Castle prepared to cope\n1sjlado the power of Great Britain\nIn a very brief space of time he had\nplanned a new insurrection which was to\ncoincide with the landing of French\ntroops but the inevitable traitors and\ncertain mishaps and misunderstandings\ncaused a weak and disconnected attempt\non July 23 in Dublin which was promptly\nsuppressed A brief thrusting of pikes\nin the streets some volleys from the sol\ndiers and the last fires of the movement\nof the United Irishmen had burned out\nleaving Erin in the most helpless plight\nexhausted friendless resourceless at the\ntender mercy of her secular enemy\nThe trial of Emmet was like ten thou\nsand other Irish State trials a judicial\nFarce for he was dead within twentyfour\nhours of the opening of the trial Of him\nit might truly be said that nothing hI his I\nlife became him like the leaving of it\nHis dying words proclaim the gist of\nIrelands grievances the heartlessness\ncorruption and prejudice of her con\nqueror The lips of Emmet were but the\nchannel for the composite utterance of\nall the Irishmen who ever bled or died\nfor country or religion or for both No\nman wasever so surely the spokesman of\noppressed innocence and the herald of\nIron nemesis as Robert Emmet when he\npaced with emotion that narrow dock in\nDublin and swaying slightly as was his\nwont in speaking pronounced a loud\nhut exquisitely modulated voice this\nsentence against a nation that had so\nlong and so signally outraged the lie\ntates of humanity\nThe man dies but his memory lives\nThat mine may not perish that it may\nlive in the respect of my countrymen I\nseize this opportunity to vindicate myself\nfrom some of the charges alleged against\nme When my spirit shall be wafted to\nsome more friendly port when my shade\nshall have joined the bands of those\nmartyred heroes who have shed their\nblood on the scaffold and in the field in\ndefense of their country and of virtue I\nwish that my name and my memory may\nanimate those who survive me while I\nlook down with complacency on the\ndestruction of that perfidious Govern\nment which upholds its domination by\nblasphemy of the Most High which dis\nplays its power over man as over beasts of\nthe forest which sets man upon his brother\nand lifts his hand in the name of God\nagainst the throat of his fellow who be\nlieves or doubts a little more or a little\nless than the Government standard a\nGovernment which is steeled to barbarity\nby the cries of the orphans and the tears\nof the widows which it has made\nMy lord you seem impatient for the\nsacrifice The blood for which you thirst\nis not congealed by the artificial terrors\nwhich surround your victim it circulates\nwarmly and unruffled through the chan\nnels which God created for nobler pur\nposes but which vou are bent to destroy\nfor purposes so grievous that they cry to\nHeaven Be ye yet impatient I have\nbut a few words to say I am going to\nmy cold and silent grave my lamp of\nlife is nearly extinguished my race is\nrun the grave opens to receive me and\nI sink into its bosom I have but one\nrequest to ask at my departure from this\nworld It is the charity of its silence\nLet no man write my epitaph for as no\nman who knows my motives dare now\nvindicate them let not prejudice or igno\nrance asperse them Let them and me\nrest in obscurity and peace an < 7 my tomb\nremain uniriscribed until other times and\nother men can do justice to my character\nWhen my country takes her place among\nthe nations of the earth then and not\ntill then let my epitaph be written\nSo perished Robert Emmet the flower\nof Irelands youth the pride of Irelands\nchivalry the peer of any of the brave\nand stainless souls who have lived and\ndied for her welfare Cut off in the hey\nday of manhood before a smiling world\nthat beckoned him to the accepted path\nof glory and renown branded as a trai\ntor and singed with every infamy that\ninfamous laws could inflict his name\nhas become as he foresaw one of the\nworlds great shibboleths\nOhl breathe not his name let it rest in\nthe shade\nWhere cold and unhonorcd his relics are\nlaid\nSad silent and dark be the tears that we\nshed\nAs the night dew that falls on the grass\noer his head\nBut the night dew that falls though in\nsilence it weeps\nShall brighten with verdure the grave\nsleepsAmI\nAnd the tear that we shed though in\nsecret it rolls\nShall long keep his memory green in our\nsouls\np p\nKENTUCKIANS\nBanquet at St Louis on Anni\nversary of

com\npanies will pay it and let it go at\nthat How blinded some folks be\ncome in urging legislation to tax\nthe rich as they term it On taxI I\none hand they argue that all taxes\nare paid by the consumer and then\nsuddenly they seem to ignore that\nlogical fact So the consumer\npolicy holder will pay the pro\nposed tax though the companies\nwill be assessed and pay it direct to <\nthe State because the companies\ncan not afford to pay it out of their\nprofits and would not if they could\nIf the bill passes the policy holder\nwill pay the tax or as has been\ndone in other States the insurance\ncompanies will cancel all Kentucky\npolicies and leave the State Then\nwho will lose It is time this kind\nof cranky legislation were stopped\nKentucky has had far too much of\nit already\nalreadyFOLLOW\nFOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE\nThe Catholics of Connecticut are I\nprotesting against the denial of\nreligious liberty to Catholic inmates\nand the proselytying of Catholic\nchildren in the public institutions\nof that State It is surprising that\nthose energetic and well organized\nCatholics should have submitted\nthus long to such intolerance when\ntheir brethren in other states have\nremedied such things years ago\nWe had a similar condition of\nthings in Kentucky until after a\nsix years contest a liberty of con\nscience bill was enacted which\nopens the doors of public

government and\nthe promise of further concessions\nthe Irish people have displayed\nnew energy and progress develop\ning and extending public roads\nimproving public buildings in\ncreasing manufactures and farm\nproducts opening up new markets\nand have prospered They have\nalso been lawabiding the courts\nhaving few cases to try and fre\nquently none at all But this has\ntended to bring the Irish people\ntogether and unite them in urging\nthe promised additional concessions\nand sending a nearly solid delega\ntion to Parliament to insist upon\ntheir being granted\nNaturally the one vital question\nwhich bears heaviest and most re\ntards development and oppresses the I\nIrish peoplethe land question\nis being most earnestly advocated\nand on this the Irish people are\nthoroughly united and active the\nLeague seeking redress only\nthrough legal means backed up by\nsithltar t organizations in the United\nStates the British colonies and in\nEngland and Scotland The ques\ntion must come before before Par\nliament and the pledge to grant\nrelief to the Irish tenantry must be\nmet unless some way can be found\nto avert it And it seems that the\nBritish Government is seeking the\nsame old way of evading promises\nto Ireland and preparing the way\nfor an excuse to give more oppres\nsion instead of relief\nThus without warning and\nutterly ignoring the usual forms of\ncivil procedure in cases of alleged\nviolations of law the forms if not\nthe actual rule of martial law and\ncoercion are put in full force in\nCounty Roscommon because of al\nleged violations of the land law by\ntenants Without legal process\nwithout warrant tenants have been\nevicted houses entered and\nsearched persons arrested and im\nprisoned bail and even counsel\nbeing denied and the entire sec\ntion of the country is being\npatrolled by armed constables per\nsons including members of Parlia\nment officials prominent trades\nmen People of good character\nhave been summarily arrested re\nfused bail for attending public\nmeetings not forbidden by law\nThat the real offense if any was\ntrivial is shown in the result of the\ntrials that have taken placeusually\na few days in jail though the mem\nbers of Parliament were given I\nninety days and refused bail pend\ning an appeal thus preventing\ntheir attending Parliament now in i I\nsession\nsessionSuch\nSuch a severe and arbitrary\ncourse by the Government can have\nno ground for justification the\nIrish people being unusually peace\nable and lawabiding devoting\ntheir energy to industries and l\ntrade aud in their desire for redress I\nof grievances adhering to strictly\nleg lanJ peaceful means The\nGovopmeut can have but one pur\np6M rto terrorize the Irish J people\nD a it\nj\ninto abandoning their efforts for\nfurther redress to force the disso\nlution of the Irish league and\nNational party and restore the\nI i landlords to prestige and control in\nIreland or by provoking the people\nto utterances and acts as a pretext\nfor restrictive and coercive meas\nures and a resort to armed force to\nsettle the Irish question for a\ntime at leastin blood if neces\nsary\nThe crisis has been reached by\nthe Irish people if not by the Gov\neminent and upon their forbear\nance and restraint trying as it will\nbe depends the future of their ef\nforts for their country Their first\novert act no matter what the pro\nvocation will be taken advantage\nof by the Government to crush out\nthe League and Nationalist party\nand add further oppression on the\nIrish people Aggravating as are\nthe

you\nYet it seems but yesterday\nFor you are always in view\nDistance enchantment lends\nTo the music we love to hear\nWhile absence the stronger blends\nOur souls and holds us more dear\nTwas au

the\nsunlight of a happy face It may be a\nlittle faceone that we nestle upon our\nbosom or sing to sleep in our arms with a\nlullaby It may be a wrinkled face but\nit is all the dearer for that and

face is\ngone\nORIGIN OP TYING THE KNOT\nFew of those who talk of the Car\nriage knot realize that the knot was\never anything more than a mere figure of\nspeech Among the Babylonians tying\nthe knot was part of the marriage cere\nmony There the priest took a thread of\nthe garment of the bride and another\nfrom that of the bridegroom and tied\nthem into a knot which he gave to the\nbride thus symbolizing the binding\nnature of the union which now existed\nbetween herself and her husband\nGIRLS SHOULD LEARN TO COOK\nMuch of the unhappiness not to say\nmisery of life Is due directly or indirectly\nto the cooking and in probably nine\ncases in ten poor cooking is due to the\nfact that the mistress of the household is\ngrossly ignorant of the culinary art Not\nknowing how the kitchen should be con\nducted or how any dish should be pre\npared she is at the mercy of the cooks I I\ncarelessness slovenliness or dishonesty I\nYoung women should learn the art ofI I\ncooking a good meal It is an accom\nplishment as well as a protection I\nn\nFAMED IRISH SONGS\nEMMET\nThough the minstrel of Erin who chanted\nhis fame\nHath said of her martyr Ohl I breathe\nnot his name\nYet what bard of erne the wild harp\ncould wake\nAnd forget the young hero who died for\nher sake\nThough the page of her history holds to\nour view\nMany names of the valiant the fearless\nthe true\nYet sad memory turns away to recall\nThe brightest the noblest the purest\nof all\nOh his was the heart that to fear was un\nknown\nWhen the loud trump of freedom through\nErin was blown\nHow far calmer his fetterless sleep in the\ngrave\nThan the clink of the chains on the limbs\nof a slave 1\nThough Columbias first chieftain and\nBrutus and Tell\nAre names to awaken bright libertys\nspell\nYet undimmed by its luster should cloud\nless be seen\nThe patriot chief of the standard of\ngreen\nAnd when the proud sunburst of Erin\nunfurled\nProclaiming her free shall illumine the\nworld\nEmblazoned shall be on its folds waving\nwide\nThe name of our hero her martry her\npride\nThe flawed Diamond\nIve been very much interested in read\ning about them former alcoholic digen\nerates remarked Col Martin Haley\nNot that Im an alcoholic digenerate my\nself for In the first place I never drink\nmore than I can carry and in the second\nI cant reconcile meself to allyiu1 such a\nword as digenerate with good whisky\nBut I once found meself in much the\nsame position as some of them fellers\nbarrin the jag only much worse off than\nany of them What would ye say to a\nman with seventytwo cents in his pocket\nn broken head and 10000 miles away\nfrom every soul that knew him Well\nthats the way I was fixed but I won out\nand at the present time I have money in\nthe bank fifteen hundred acres of decent\nlund and God knows how many head of\ncattle Let any of them former digen\nerates beat that if they can\nThe way it happened was this I ran\naway from Dublin when I was a lad of\ntwelve for the reason that me father was\na hard man and the fist of him was no\nsofter than the rest of his makeup I\ngot a job as a cabin boy on an Australian\ntrader and settled down near Sydney\nwhere I stayed for ten years and saved up\nC 600 not bad for a lad eh Then I\npulled up stakes and started for the\nUnited States My idea was to invest\nmy money in a ranch somewhere and\nbecome a landed gentleman I had heard\nabout Kansas City I didnt know a soul\nin the place or in the country for that\nmatter barrin a few travelin acquaint\nances Id met\nWell the day I struck Kansas City the\ngas house blew up That night it was\ndarker than hades and ye can imagine\nthat none but an Irishman would start\nout to see the town under them circum\nstances Before Id gone far I saw more\nlight than a million gas houses could\nmake in a month and then I saw nothin1\nat all Some coyote had cracked me\nover the head with a stocking filled with\nsandso they told me at the hospital a\nweek laterand < all hed left me was\nseventytwo cents and the key to my\ntrunk His little trick bad netted him\ntwo thousand dollers in bills and n dia\nmond ring with a funny little flaw in the\nstone I told the police I would know\nthat stone anywhere and they started to\ntrace up the fellow that soaked me by\nthat clew They never found him nor\nthe diamond neither and meantime I got\nfired from the hotel I had lodged out\nthe value of my trunk There I was as\nI told ye thousands of miles from any\none I knew and without a cent to my\nname Dont that beat your retired di\ngenerate in a canter 1\nI started to hoof it through Kansas\nlookin for any old kind of a job The\nplace was full of tramps I was no better\nthan that mind yeand the divil a per\nmanent situation could I get anywhere\nFarmers was drivin the whole bunch of\nhoboes along with guns me with the\nrest Finally I got down to a place\ncalled Coffeyville There wasnt any\ntramps theremost likely because it was\nsuch a forsaken town at that time\nCoffeyville ye know is down by the In\ndian Territory line I got a job there in\na livery stable at three dollars a week\nand my grub and the boss was a decent\nman He says to me one day\nMartin he says Ive got a good\nplace for ye if yell take it down in the\nTerritory where yell have a chance to\nget on better than here\nWhat doin says I\nRanch band on a big place says he\nWhat me work for an Injun says\nI for I knew that none but a Cherokee\ntribesman could hold land in the strip\nthat was long before Uncle Sam bought\nit and opened it up for settlement\nWhat of m says the boss

helpedhim to un\nhitch we went to the house There was\na fine slip cf a girl stand In in the door\nShe had big black eyes and hair to\nmatchThats\nThats my daughter Dovita says\nMaguire\nYou would never think she was Injun\nbarrin the straightness of her hair and\nher backbone for in the first place she\nwas clean and in the second place she I\nwas pretty but thats not to be wondered\nat seein that she was half colleen and\nonly a quarter squaw\nWanting to be pleasant 1 gave her a\ncompliment but she only turns up her\nnose and begins talkin tp her papa\nshowin tint she considered me tiothin1\nmore than what I really wasa hired\nman My pride was hurt but I went\nright to work and made up my mind that\nsome day I would make that aristocratic\nCherokee lady take off her hat to me so\nto speak\nspeakBeing\nBeing brought up in the saddle I\ncould ride anything that wore hair as\nthe sayin is and one day I noticed that\nwhile I was liavin a beautiful argument\nwith a little divil of a broncho front\nTexas Miss Dovita was watchin me\nwith the kind of a light in her eyes that\nboded me no bad So after that when I\nwent to bustin bronchos I managed to\ndo it not so faraway from the house but\nthem as had eyes could see the operation\nwithout any assistance from a spyglass\nTheres nothin an Irishman will fight so\nhard for as somethin he can get and I\nwas workin overtime for a decent wont\nfrom the lady who neednt have been so\nproud over the maternal end of her\nbeginnings dont ye see\nWell in two or three months or may\nbe it was four down comes a fine lookin\nfeller with elegant ways who had a let\nter to Maguire He was thinkin of\nranching it he said and wanted a chance\nto learn the business Would Maguire\ntake him on as a hand just for experi\nence Of course Maguire takes him on\ngives him the big spare room and\ndoesnt boss him around like he does\nme but leaves him to do as he pleases\nThis fellerJohnson was his nametook\nto the cattle business right smart for all\nhe was a tenderfoot and a poor rider\nBut after a while I noticed that he\nspent considerable more time in I the\nhouse with Miss Dovita than out on the\nrange with the cattle Things went on\nlike this for a few weeks when one day I\nnoticed on Dovitas finger a diamond\nring One look at it showed me that it\nwas my own jewel jith the funny little\nflaw in it that Id taken from me\nthat night in jewelIth\nWhats the maflH Martin says\nshe Have you seen t thost\nNot unless diamonds have immortal\nsouls I says but I have seen that\nstone before I\nWith that she blushed for she wasnt\nso dark but that roses could show in her\ncheeks Might I ask where you got it I\nsaysShe\nShe looked mad and said something\nabout mindiu my own business\nIts my own business I says blunt\nlike for that diamond happens to be\nbelonging to me\nIf she was mad before she was raging\nnow She called me a liar to me face\nand said that Mr Johnson had given it\nI\nto her\nSo youre goin toj marry him I\nsays and she blurts out that Mr ohn8 n\nand her papa was goin1 into partnership\nle\nin a way and that tiliewas in the bar\ngain >\nI run down to the stable and there\nwas old Maguire and Johnson I seen\nJohnson take out a pocketbook and pick\nmemorandum out of it It was m\nown pocketbook I walks up to him and\nsaysI\nI congratulate you on your engage\nwent to Miss Dovita says I\nThe devil you do he says lookin\nat me like I wall a yeller dog Thank\nye he says\nThats a fine ring ye gave her I\nsays might I ask where ye got m\nNone of your business says he\nflarin upI\nNo says I nor its none of my\nbusiness where ye got that pocketbook\nnaither only they belong to me\nWhats the meanin of all this says\nMaguire openiu his eyes\nThe mans crazy says Johnson but\nhe looked mighty white around the\ngillsBad\nBad cess to yesays I Its not\nyour fault Im not after the crack on\nthe cocoanut ye gave me awhile back in\nKansas City\nThen old Maguire begins to get next\nto the facts of the case\nI never was in Kansas City says\nJohnson lookin uncomfortable\nSure then youll soon have that\npleasure says I an Ill be your\nescort And with that I pulls my gun\nGo easy says old Maguire\nlies the one that had better go easy\nsays I Take his gun from him\nSee here says Johnson youre\ntalkin bosh Im out of the jurisdiction\nof loth Kansas and Missouri and only\na United States marshal can touch me\nSo youve studied that out ye black I\nguard I says Well jurisdiction o\nno jurisdiction j I touch ye me bucko\nand youll be within the jurisdiction of\nKansas City before another night if I\nhave to haul you along with a lariat\nThats kidnapping says he\nSure youre na kid says I but n\ndirty thieving blackguard of a thug and\nhighwayman\nAnd then Maguire gets his tongue\nloose and the way he lambasted that\nshiverin1 divil in good IrishAmerican\nwas a sight for the angels\nIISee here says Johnson when he\ncould get a word in I know nothin\nabout your ring and your pocketbook\nbut rather than have any trouble Im\nwillin to settle\nNow youre talkin sense I says\ngive me back the diamond ring and me\nmoney\nmoneyI\nI havent got 2000 with me says\nJohnson\nBean as youre innocent I says\nhow did you know it was 2000 I lost\nThat knocked him clean out and he\nhadnt another word to say\nThrow me back that pocketbook I\nsays fiercelike and he done it I\ncounted over J3000 in bills in it\nWould you rob me cries the sniv\nelfin sneak\nTurn about is fair play I says\npleasant enough IIbnt seeinUs ginteel\nyoure bebavin1 Ill only take back me\nown with interest for the loan\nWith that I counts out 2030 and gives\nhim back the rest\nNow can I go asks Johnson\nKeep your shirt on I says theres\nanother little matter to be settled be\ntween us You wrote your autograph on\nthe back of my head with a billy and\nIm goin to return the compliment by\nwritiu mine on your face with me fists\nMaguire will see fair play I\nIf Id known how that divil could\nfight I mightnt have been so free He\ncame at me like a cyclone and kept me\nas busy as a boy drivin pigs He\nhumped himself elegant and old Ma\nguire at a safe distance gave some real\nold Irish yells that nearly stampeded the\ncattle in the corral But I can scrap a\nbit myself and I thumped that thief\nbeautiful He wasnt pretty to look at\nwhen he yelled enough and I wasnt\njust fixed to have me photograph taken\nneither but Id had satisfaction and\nfelt better\nJohnson washed his face at the well\nbrushed himself with a horse brush and\nstarted on his fortymile walk to town I\nhavent seen him since\nMaguire and myself went back to the\nhouse There was Dovita who had seen\nthe whole Business half cryin and beg\ngin to know what it was all about The\nold man told her and then Dovita

which can only be\nwitnessed by standing in the parish\nchurchyard of Leek in Staffordshire\nEngland From that position the top of\na mountain known as the Cloud breaks\nthe line of sight and fully intercepts\nyour view of the setting of the sun This\nmountain is six miles distant as the\ncrow flies from the town of Leek and\nowing to its peculiar formation causes\nthe sun when it has entered that sign\nof the zodiac known as Cancer which\nhappens when we are about half way\nthrough the year to produce the strange\neffect of setting twice daily The first\ntime that it sets the town sinks
