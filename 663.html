E-mail: Aiyana.Willard@brunel.ac.uk\nAbstract\nCredibility Enhancing Displays have been shown to be an important component in the transmission of\nempirically unverifiable cultural content such as religious beliefs. Decreased Credibility Enhancing\nDisplays are a major predictor of religious decline. However, because declines in belief are often paired\nwith the decreasing importance of religious institutions, existing research has not yet shown the effect\nof Credibility Enhancing Displays as separate from this institutional decline. Here, we assess the role of\npast Credibility Enhancing Display exposure among the baptised Catholic population of Ireland in\npredicting who retains a Catholic identity and religious beliefs among those who reject the Catholic\nChurch. We find that leaving Catholicism outright (i.e. ‘ex-Catholicism’) is predicted by low Credibility\nEnhancing Display exposure, but rejecting the Church while retaining a Catholic identity (i.e. ‘liminal\nCatholicism’) and theistic belief is not. High perceived prevalence of clerical paedophiles (i.e. religious\nhypocrisy) predicts both groups similarly. Higher exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays predicts\nhigher orthodox Catholic beliefs and Catholic morality among Catholics, but with inconsistent and\neven negative effects among the other groups. High perceived prevalence of clerical paedophiles predicts\nthe rejection of orthodox Catholic beliefs, but not the rejection of theism or a Catholic identity.\nKeywords: Credibility Enhancing Displays; Irish Catholicism; secularisation; clerical abuse; religious hypocrisy; nonreligion\nSocial media summary: High estimates of clerical paedophilia predict the rejection of orthodox tenets\nof belief among Irish individuals who have been baptised Catholic, but only low levels of religious signalling\nfrom parents predict leaving Catholicism entirely and rejecting theism in general.\n1. Introduction\nCultural evolutionary research has suggested that people are more likely to accept empirically unverifiable\nbeliefs (for instance the belief that there is a God, or that He is Three Divine Persons in One) if\nthey have witnessed other people’s behavioural commitment to these same beliefs (Henrich, 2009).\nThese behavioural cues are known as ‘Credibility Enhancing Displays’. Credibility Enhancing\nDisplays consist of ‘costly’ or ‘hard to fake’ signals such as ritual participation, taboo observation,\nscarification, celibacy and others. Such acts offer proof that belief is more than a matter of lip service\nand should be taken seriously by cultural learners (Lanman & Buhrmeister, 2016). When religious\nbeliefs fail to transmit across generations in large swathes of society, it may be because social changes\nhave precipitated a decline in supporting Credibility Enhancing Displays (Lanman, 2012; Willard &\nCingl, 2017). In essence, while people may still believe in some religious propositions, they stop participating\nin the ritual and other behavioural practices necessary to instil these beliefs in the next\n© The Author(s), 2022.

The result is that religious beliefs become peripheral\nadd-ons rather than core components of shared in-group worldviews, and they are more easily\nneglected or rejected by cultural learners. Over the space of a generation religious belief begins to\nfade away.\nOne critique of existing empirical literature on Credibility Enhancing Displays is the difficulty in\nseparating specific religious beliefs, identities and values from an affiliation with a religious institution.\nThose exposed to higher Credibility Enhancing Displays tend to report maintaining high levels of religious\nbelief and identity, but the literature thus far has not been very specific on what this actually\nentails (e.g. Willard & Cingl, 2017). Religiosity declines with declines in exposure to Credibility\nEnhancing Displays, but also with the decline in importance of religious institutions and all the things\nthat go with them. This makes it difficult to determine the effect of behavioural displays on belief itself.\nWe can sperate this in a sample where an institution is rejected for a reason other than lack of belief –\nin this case the rejection of the Catholic Church owing to clerical abuse scandals in Ireland – by testing\nif Credibility Enhancing Displays predict the maintenance of religiosity even when the religious institution\nitself has been rejected.\nHere, we assess the role of past Credibility Enhancing Display exposure among the baptised\nCatholic population of Ireland in predicting who retains and who rejects orthodox Catholic religious\nbeliefs and Catholic identity in a time of widespread church scandal. Many who have rejected the\nauthority of the Catholic Church have also rejected associated doctrinal beliefs, but not all have.\nWhat makes this a particularly interesting setting for furthering our understanding of Credibility\nEnhancing Displays is that moral scandal gives people a reason to reject Catholicism that is unrelated\nto exposure to the sorts of ritual behaviours that are thought to instil long-lasting belief. Here, we test if\npast Credibility Enhancing Display exposure can help us differentiate those who maintain some levels\nof religious belief from those who do not within the broader group who have rejected the authority of\nthe Church. We also look at the role of Credibility Enhancing Display exposure in determining the\nacceptance of theism in general, specific orthodox Catholic theological propositions (e.g. the Virgin\nBirth or the Trinity) and symbolic divine moral edicts associated with the Church (e.g. opposition\nto contraception and abortion).\nIn addition to the predictive role of past Credibility Enhancing Display exposure in reinforcing\nCatholicism, we also examine the link between clerical scandal and the rejection of Catholicism.\nOutrage at religious hypocrisy – the very opposite of a Credibility Enhancing Display – has been\na highly salient feature of Irish public discourse for three decades. Ireland’s prolific clerical abuse\nscandals could be taken to indicate that the Church very much does not believe in the morally interested\nGod it verbally endorses, nor in the strict moral codes it once enforced on others with such\nzeal (Hilliard, 2003; Turpin et al., 2017). Since the late 1990s, trust in the Church has declined\nmore quickly in Ireland than in other European Catholic societies (Donnelly & Inglis, 2010). For\nmany, the institutional Church has become an object of contempt (Iona Institute, 2011; Inglis,\n2014; Scally, 2021; Turpin, 2022). Nevertheless, while most of the population have been shocked\nby these scandals, not all have renounced Catholicism as a result (e.g. Ganiel, 2016, 2019).\nAgainst this cultural backdrop, we hypothesise that lower domestic Credibility Enhancing Display\nexposure and higher perceived prevalence of clerical paedophilia combine to significantly undermine\nCatholic belief and to predict decisions to leave Catholicism. We predict that lower\nCredibility Enhancing Display exposure will differentiate those who have left the religion entirely\n(i.e. ‘ex-Catholics’) from those who have remained, but that past Credibility Enhancing Display\nexposure will not differentiate between orthodox Catholics and those who have retained a\nCatholic identity but rejected the authority of the Church (‘liminal Catholics’). We predict that\nhigher perceived prevalence of clerical paedophilia will predict membership in both groups of leavers\ncompared with orthodox Catholics.\nAs well as looking at theism, we take a more exploratory approach to examining other beliefs and\nmorals central to Catholicism. Since these beliefs are more specifically related to Church authority\nthan belief in God, we expect that both groups of leavers will reject these to some degree. We will\n2 Hugh D. Turpin and Aiyana K. Willard\n', 'test the role that Credibility Enhancing Displays and perceived prevalence of clerical paedophilia play\nin commitment to these beliefs and moral values across all three groups.\n1.1. Credibility Enhancing Displays\nRecent work examining the adoption of religious beliefs has emphasised the role of context biases in\ntheir transmission (Gervais, Willard, Norenzayan, A., & Henrich, 2011; Gervais et al., 2021). These are\nevolved tendencies to selectively accept information based on contextual social cues such as the prestige,\ncompetence or conformity of the information source (Boyd, Richerson & Henrich, 2011; Henrich,\n2015). One bias with particular importance for religious transmission is thought to be the ‘Credibility\nEnhancing Display’ bias (Henrich, 2009). The theory of Credibility Enhancing Displays argues that\nhumans use a learning heuristic to avoid deception by preferentially attending to verbal statements\nbacked up by hard to fake behavioural evidence of true belief. For example, people are more likely\nto adopt a positive view towards, and install, solar panels when they see that those who endorse\nsolar energy also install their own panels (Kraft-Todd et al., 2018). Religions that have culturally\nevolved to exploit this bias by associating beliefs with costly or hard to fake behaviours should become\nmore successful (Henrich, 2009).\nCurrent evidence for the role of such displays in belief transmission is promising if somewhat\nsparse. Henrich’s original 2009 paper combined an analytic model with supporting evidence from\ndevelopmental and social psychological sources (e.g. Harper & Sanders, 1975; Walster, Aronson &\nAbrahams, 1966; Bryan & Walbeck, 1970; Grusec, 1971; Harris, Pasquini, Duke, Asscher, & Pons,\n2006). Subsequently, Lanman and Buhrmeister (2017) created and used a ‘Credibility Enhancing\nDisplay scale’ to find that parental exposure to these behaviours was the strongest predictor of whether\nor not an individual became a theist or non-theist. Willard and Cingl (2017) found that differing levels\nof childhood exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays were a strong predictor of the large differences\nin theism between otherwise culturally similar Czechs and Slovaks. Gervais et al. (2021) similarly\nfound that low Credibility Enhancing Display exposure was the strongest predictor of religious decline\nin a representative sample from the US. Using their own correlational measure and a large sample of\n67,000 individuals, Maij and colleagues (2017) argued that exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays\nplays a much larger role in generating religious belief than individual differences in sensitivity to content\nfeatures. Langston and colleagues also found that higher exposure predicted a later age of religious\nrejection among members of online New Atheist communities (Langston, Speed, & Coleman, 2020).\nWhile most studies have been correlational, Willard and colleagues found that people were more\namenable to believing counterintuitive scientific information if they saw an experimental confederate\nperforming a supporting Credibility Enhancing Display for the information in question (Willard,\nHenrich, & Norenzayan, 2016).\nAt a theoretical level, such religious displays have also been tied to the process of secularisation.\nSociological data suggest that intergenerational declines in belief tend to occur when existential security\nrises (Norris & Inglehart, 2011; Inglehart, 2021). Lanman proposes that declines in Credibility\nEnhancing Displays underlie this causal relationship (Lanman, 2012). According to Lanman, religious\nbeliefs act as identity markers which signal in-group commitment (Sosis, Kress & Boster, 2007;\nHenrich, 2009; Atran, 2010). Under conditions of threat, commitment to shared in-group beliefs\nand values escalates, probably as a means of recruiting coalitional support (Greenberg, Solomon, &\nPyszczynski, 1997; Navarrete & Fessler, 2005; Eriksen, Bal, & Salemink, 2010). These dynamics\nincrease the prevalence of public actions, indicating commitment to shared (frequently religious)\nworldviews, and this bolsters the transmission of associated religious beliefs for cultural learners. As\nthreat declines, so does religious action. Lanman argues that his ‘threat and action’ theory can help\nexplain differing international levels of religious belief (for example, low levels in existentially secure\nScandinavia and higher levels in the more existentially precarious USA). However, more work is\nneeded to firmly tie declines in Credibility Enhancing Displays to declining religious belief (including\nwhich particular beliefs are declining), and to the social changes behind the process of secularisation.\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 3\n', '1.2. Irish secularisation\nIreland offers a particularly interesting environment to examine the relationship between Credibility\nEnhancing Displays and secularisation. Until the 1990s, Ireland was one of the most impoverished\nsocieties in Western Europe – and one of the most religious (Garvin, 2004). During the nineteenth\ncentury, under the influence of Cardinal Cullen, Irish Catholic orthodoxy was amplified in the\nwake of the Great Famine, developing into a highly self-abnegating and performative style of devout\nobeisance based on tight adherence to Roman best practice (Larkin, 1976; Inglis, 1998; Scally, 2021).\nFrom a cultural evolutionary perspective, costly religious signalling proliferated wildly. One scholar has\ndescribed the behavioural adornments of post-Famine Catholicism as follows:\nConfession and communion… became much more frequent. Pastoral gains… were consolidated\nby the introduction of a whole series of devotional exercises designed not only to encourage more\nfrequent participation in the sacraments but to instill veneration by an appreciation of their ritual\nbeauty and intrinsic mystery … The new devotions were mainly of Roman origin and included\nthe rosary, forty hours, perpetual adoration, novenas, blessed altars, Via Crucis, benediction, vespers,\ndevotion to the Sacred Heart and to the Immaculate Conception, jubilees, triduums, pil-\ngrimages, shrines, processions, and retreats. (Larkin, 1976: 77)\nThis highly behaviourally enriched religious culture persisted deep into the twentieth century. After\nindependence in 1922, Church and State became very closely intertwined. Poverty, nationalism and\nintegralism meant Catholicism continued to play a central role in Irish life and group identity.\nBoth public and domestic life were saturated with religious signalling: to be Irish was to be (and to\nbe seen to be) a ‘good Catholic’ (Inglis, 1998). Indeed, the traditional ‘Irish Catholic mother’ was\nmemorably described by the influential sociologist Tom Inglis as ‘the living embodiment of Our\nLady – humble, pious, celibate and yet fecund’ (Inglis, 1998: 249). Alongside the public dominion\nof the Church, Inglis described a culture of parallel domestic religious reinforcement, with mothers\nacting as ‘the Church’s representative in the home’ (Inglis, 1998). Stemming in part from this culture,\nsurvey data has long indicated that religious affiliation and belief have remained unusually high in\nIreland compared with elsewhere in Western Europe (e.g. Bullivant, 2017).\nNevertheless, recent decades have seen a rapid shift towards secularisation. Owing to top-down\nshifts in economic and social policy and bottom-up processes of cultural globalisation, Catholic isolationism\ndeclined from the 1960s onwards (Inglis, 1998; O’Toole, 2021). From the 2000s onwards,\nIrish religious and moral attitudes realigned with those more typical of other European societies\n(Fuller, 2002; Penet, 2008). In particular, the ‘Celtic Tiger’ economic boom of the 1990s and 2000s\nprecipitated a ‘change in people’s perceptions of themselves, their lifestyles, morale, confidence and\nsense of independence’ (Fuller, 2002: 232). Religious attendance collapsed over this period\n(Donnelly & Inglis, 2010). While the last Irish Census in 2016 recorded 78.3% of the population as\nCatholic, the nature of the link has changed greatly. Sociologists describe how orthodox piety has\nlargely come to be replaced by low-cost ‘cultural Catholicism’, revolving around a small number of\nculturally important and lightly enjoyable rites of passage (Inglis, 1998; McWilliams, 2019). Yet\nwhile ‘cultural religion’ has prevailed, Credibility Enhancing Displays have collapsed. In the words\nof one observer, Ireland is now an increasingly ‘ambivalent place’ where growing numbers ‘don’t\nbelieve a word of it’ but baptise their children anyway, largely for reasons of belonging, social expedience\nand cultural habit rather than out of any sense of piety (McWilliams, 2019: 2). Religion, for\nthe most part, is undemanding and quarantined to rare occasions.\nThis low-cost version of Catholicism may not mark a stable equilibrium. The last decade has seen\nthe emergence and rapid growth of unaffiliated Irish people. In censuses, the religiously unaffiliated\nrose from 4% in 2002 to 10% in 2016. In the European Social Survey, a measure less prone to ethnonationally\nmotivated nominal affiliation, non-religion rose from 14% in 2002 to 32% in 2018.\nAccording to Win-Gallup (2012), Ireland now has a greater proportion of ‘convinced atheists’ than\n4 Hugh D. Turpin and Aiyana K. Willard\n', 'Britain, Germany and the Scandinavian countries. The Credibility Enhancing Display-poor culturally\nCatholic system does not appear to be producing many committed believers – and, in combination\nwith clerical scandals and the Church’s perceived anti-progressive influence, it may even be generating\na considerable amount of anti-theism, with Irish non-religious individuals by some measures the most\nanti-religious in Western Europe (Ribberink, Achterberg, & Houtman, 2013).\n1.3. Clerical abuse scandals and religious hypocrisy\nOne factor which complicates any clear relationship between Credibility Enhancing Display collapse\nand rising Irish religious rejection is the growth in public perceptions of religious hypocrisy on the part\nof Catholic paragons. Ireland’s period of social liberalisation and economic boom coincided with the\nmoral discrediting of the Church. Those socialised in the period from the 1990s onwards were not\nsimply exposed to lower religious behavioural signalling; they were also ‘born into a Church of scandal’,\nas one clerical informant described it (Turpin, 2022). ‘The scandals’ commenced in the early\n1990s with national news reports of violated clerical chastity, escalating swiftly to reports of child\nabuse and cover-ups. From there, the scandals widened to include the reappraisal of coercive carceral\ninstitutions operated by Catholic orders, such as Industrial Schools, Magdalene Laundries, and Mother\nand Baby Homes (Finnegan, 2001; Raftery & O’Sullivan, 2009; Hogan, 2019). The Church and its\norders are now frequently represented as immoral forces to be opposed rather than social paragons\nto be emulated (e.g. Pine, 2011). Clerical abuse is commonly framed as a form of extreme hypocrisy,\ngiven the Church’s historical interest in dictating sexual behaviour and punishing deviation from strict\nconservative norms (Goode, McGee, & O’Boyle, 2003; Hilliard, 2003; Hogan, 2019). One 2003 study\non Irish public responses to the clerical abuse scandals described a public who were ‘horrified’ not only\n‘because people abhor child sexual abuse per se’ but also because abuse constituted ‘the polar opposite\nof what priests and religious are meant to be doing’ (Goode et al., 2003).\nToday, the Irish association between the Catholic Church and the arch-crime of paedophilia is particularly\ndeeply entrenched (e.g. Goode et al., 2003; Angelides, 2005; Keenan, 2012). According to a\nsurvey by a conservative Catholic think tank, the average population estimate of the number of clergy\nwho are paedophiles is 28%, with 42% of the population advancing estimates in excess of 21% (Iona\nInstitute, 2011). This same survey also found that almost a third of the Irish Catholic population would\nnot be concerned if the Church ceased to exist. As a result of clerical abuse scandals, while individual\npriests may still be evaluated as ‘good people’, the clerical category as a whole has become a target of\nmuch popular contempt (Goode et al., 2003; Egan, 2011; Turpin, 2022). From a context-based learning\nperspective, the contemptible are the opposite of the prestigious; they are probably the very last\npeople a social learner would seek to learn from (e.g. Gervais & Fessler, 2017). This may be particularly\ntrue of those deemed contemptible specifically because of their perceived hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is\nprocessed as the ultimate warning signal of the deceptive free rider (Jordan, Sommers, Bloom, & Rand,\n2017). Such paragon hypocrisy may be particularly undermining for religious beliefs, because their\nacceptance is more dependent on trust and social proof than more directly verifiable propositions\n(e.g. Shupe, 1997; Wollschleger & Beach, 2011). The social category of priests, in other words, has\nbecome a prominent source of ‘Credibility Undermining Displays’ for Catholic representations (e.g.\nTurpin et al., 2017; Turpin, 2019). Priests probably hold this status in the eyes of disengaged\nCatholics in particular, as their attitudes towards clergy are liable to be informed more by national\nmedia than by personal exposure to more positive exemplars (e.g. Donnelly & Inglis, 2010). In\nother words, a foundation of low Credibility Enhancing Display exposure probably predisposes somebody\nto be more influenced by media-relayed clerical Credibility Undermining Displays.\nHere, we examine how past exposure to parental Credibility Enhancing Displays and current contempt\nfor clergy relate to different religious outcomes among contemporary Irish baptised Catholics.\nWe examine how these variables relate to three dimensions of ‘being Catholic’: Catholic affiliation, religious\nbelief (both in God generally and in specific Catholic shibboleths such as transubstantiation) and\nacceptance of Catholic moral edicts. The data illuminate the role of past exposure to Credibility\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 5\n', 'Enhancing Displays and present disdain for the Church in predicting those who renounce or maintain\nbelief in God, those who renounce Catholic affiliation and those who do not, and those who reject\nsymbolic Catholic beliefs and edicts and those who do not.\n2. Methods\nThe current data are from an online survey run in 2017 (Turpin, 2022). The sample comprised 247\nIrish individuals of 18 years of age and over who had been baptised Catholic. This sample was\nacquired via Qualtrics Panels and was nationally representative for age, gender and socioeconomic status\n(as represented by standardised categories regarding the occupation of the chief income earner in\nthe household). The survey also contained a representative mix of urban and rural respondents (26%\ndescribed themselves as living in a city, 13% a suburb, 25% a town, 12% a village and 24% the countryside:\na fairly even breakdown of Irish habitation). This variable was included as rural Ireland is often\nthought to be more religious than the major urban centres, but owing to a number of participants\nneglecting to answer the question, it was not included in the analyses below. Respondents were also\nasked whether they had been educated in Catholic schools. Of the 204 participants who answered\nthis question, 163 had been educated at both primary and secondary level in Catholic schools, 24\nhad been educated in a Catholic school at primary level only, 17 at secondary only and only 1 participant\nhad received no Catholic schooling at all. Unfortunately we did not record education level among\nour demographics. The survey had a high response rate of 45%.\n2.1. Establishing Catholic, liminal Catholic and ex-Catholic groups\nRespondents were first asked whether they were baptised Catholics (‘Have you been baptised as a\nCatholic?’). ‘Natalism’ is thought to inflate Irish Catholic statistics by eliciting affiliative responses\nbased on past baptismal status rather than current rejection of Catholic belief or membership. By asking\nparticipants if they had been baptised first and establishing that participants had been ‘made Catholic’,\nwe aimed to diminish ethno-natalist responding in the remainder of the survey (e.g. Day, 2011). The\nsurvey then adopted an alternative two-step approach to measuring the current commitment of an individual\nto Catholicism, based around (a) self-designation (i.e. affiliation) and (b) self-perceived acceptance\nof doctrine (i.e. belief). Firstly, participants were asked how they currently described themselves (‘Would\nyou describe yourself as any of these? Please select all that apply – you may choose more than one if you\nwish: Agnostic; Atheist; Catholic; Christian – no denomination; Member of a non-Christian religion;\nProtestant Christian – any denomination; Spiritual but not religious; None of these’). After this, participants\nwere asked whether they rejected the ‘official’ doctrines and teachings of the Catholic Church\n(‘Overall, would you say you personally have or have not rejected the official beliefs, doctrines and teachings\nof the Catholic Church as guidelines for your life?’). This procedure allowed the rejection of\nCatholicism to be characterised with respect to two components: the rejection of a Catholic identity\n(e.g. disaffiliation) and the rejection of Church teachings (disbelief in institutional orthodoxies). It is possible\nto reject either, both or neither. This leaves the three larger groupings: Catholics, liminal Catholics\nand ex-Catholics. Catholics were operationalised as those who identify as Catholic and do not reject the\nteachings of the Church, liminal Catholics as those who identify as Catholic but reject the teachings of\nthe Church and ex-Catholics as those who reject both a Catholic identity and the teachings of the\nChurch. The designation ‘ex-Catholic’ can be justified by the degree to which religious and ethnic identity\nare essentially fused in an Irish context. Whether one is religious or not, once baptised, ‘being\nCatholic’ is something one just ‘is’. This is reflected in the tendency of many Irish people, including\nthose utterly disinterested in religion, to describe themselves as having been ‘born Catholic’, even if\nthey do not believe. Ex-Catholicism represents self-conscious exit not just from religion as a worldview,\nbut from an ethno-religious status ascribed in infancy. It represents a decision to opt out. The data reflect\nthis in the ages liminal and ex-Catholics report rejecting the authority of the Church: mean liminal rejection\noccurs at 21 years of age, while mean ex-Catholic rejection of the Church occurs at 18 years of age.\n6 Hugh D. Turpin and Aiyana K. Willard\n', 'There were also nine people who rejected a Catholic identity but did not reject the teachings of the\nChurch. Owing to their rejection of a Catholic identity, these participants were deemed most appropriate\nto be included in the ex-Catholic category. Overall, this yielded 97 Catholics (39.3%), 60 liminal\nCatholics (24.3%) and 90 ex-Catholics (36.4%).\n2.2. Scale measures: orthodox Catholic belief, theism, Church moral agreement and Credibility\nEnhancing Display exposure\nTheism was measured using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (certain that God does not exist) to 7\n(certain that God exists). Commitment to Catholic religious beliefs was assessed using an orthodox\nCatholic belief scale (seven-point Likert, α = 0.96, six items: transubstantiation, papal infallibility,\nthe Resurrection, miracles, the Virgin Birth, Confession). Adherence to orthodox Catholic moral positions\nwas measured using a Catholic moral agreement scale which asked participants to rate how much\nthey concurred with the Church’s official positions on a number of key moral questions (seven-point\nLikert, α = 0.89, eight items: abortion, same-sex marriage, divorce, sex before marriage, priestly celibacy,\nfemale ordination, and contraception). Credibility Enhancing Display exposure was measured\nusing a Catholic version of Lanman and Buhrmester’s 2017 Credibility Enhancing Display scale\n(seven-point Likert, α = 0.92, 8 items). These scales can be viewed in Appendix I.\n2.3. Perceived prevalence of clerical paedophiles as a proxy for moral contempt for the Catholic\nChurch\nParticipants were also asked to estimate the percentage of Catholic priests who had abused children.\nThese estimates are used below as a proxy for moral contempt for the Catholic Church. Orthodox\nCatholics gave a mean estimate that 20.3% of priests were paedophiles. The liminal Catholic mean estimation\nwas 36.1%. The ex-Catholic mean estimation was 39.5%.\n2.4. Analyses\nAlongside demographics, Credibility Enhancing Display exposure and the clerical contempt measure were\nentered into a multinomial logistic regression model to predict membership in the Catholic, liminal\nCatholic and ex-Catholic groups, as well as three linear regression models to predict levels of Catholic\nbelief, levels of general theism and acceptance of orthodox moral edicts. Continuous variables, other\nthan age and percentage estimates of clerical paedophilia, were standardised before analysis. We hypothesised\nthat lower Credibility Enhancing Display exposure would predict becoming an ex-Catholic, but not a\nliminal Catholic, and that liminal Catholics would maintain theistic belief where ex-Catholics would not.\nWe also hypothesised that lower Credibility Enhancing Display exposure and higher clerical contempt\nwould predict rejection of orthodox Catholic belief and orthodox Catholic morality.\n3. Results\n3.1. Credibility Enhancing Displays, moral contempt and the rejection of Catholic affiliation\nCan past Credibility Enhancing Display exposure predict who becomes an ex-Catholic (i.e. rejects\nCatholicism entirely), who becomes a liminal Catholic (i.e. retains Catholic affiliation while rejecting\nthe authority of the Church) and who remains an obedient Catholic? Is the effect of Credibility\nEnhancing Displays separate from the belief that priests are paedophiles?\nInitial descriptive statistics found that the groups differed on Credibility Enhancing Displays in the\nexpected way. Catholics had a mean Credibility Enhancing Display score of 5.39 (SD = 1.14), liminal\nCatholics had a mean score of 4.88 (SD = 1.27) and ex-Catholics had a mean score of 3.81 (SD = 1.51).\nThe distribution of Credibility Enhancing Display scores and estimates of paedophilia in the clergy\nwithin each group can be inspected in Figure 1. It can be visually conformed that individuals with\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 7\n', 'very low Credibility Enhancing Display scores tend to be found most frequently in the ex-Catholic\ngroup. The correlation between Credibility Enhancing Displays and estimates of paedophilia is\n−0.21 (95% CI, −0.33 to −0.09). Age significantly predicted exposure to Credibility Enhancing\nDisplays (ß = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.22–0.36) and women had marginally higher scores than men\n(ß = 0.21, 95% CI =−0.01–0.44). Age was a marginal negative predictor of estimates of paedophilia\n(ß =−0.16, 95% CI =−0.36–0.03), and women gave higher estimates than men (ß = 0.86, 95%\nCI = 0.23–1.50).\nWe next ran a multinomial logistic regression model predicting group membership. Catholic membership\nwas the reference category (Table 1). Model 1 used only Credibility Enhancing Displays and\ndemographic variables as predictors. As a proxy for moral contempt, model 2 included the predicted\npercentage of priests who were paedophiles.\nExposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays was related to a decreased odds of being an ex-Catholic\n(i.e. this group was exposed to lower Credibility Enhancing Displays, on average) in these models\n(Figure 2). Exposure to Credibility Enhancing Displays predicted a smaller decrease in the odds of\nbeing a liminal Catholic, but this effect is not significant in any of the models. Belief that there are\nmore paedophiles in the Church was related to an increased odds of being an ex-Catholic or a liminal\nCatholic.\n3.2. Theism\nAcross our three groups, belief in God only showed clear signs of decline among ex-Catholics. When\nasked if they believe in God (yes/no) 98.97% of the Catholics, 100% of the liminal Catholics and\n23.33% of the ex-Catholics said yes. Similar results were found when participants were asked about\ntheir degree of belief (1–7). Ex-Catholics (mean = 2.72, SD = 1.75) rated their belief both sizably\nand significantly lower than Catholics (mean = 5.92, SD = 1.43), but liminal Catholics did not\n(mean = 5.53, SD = 1.19). To look at group level differences in belief we first ran a regression model\nusing demographic factors alone (model 1, Table 2). Credibility Enhancing Displays and predictions\nabout paedophilia were added to model 2, as was an interaction effect between groups and Credibility\nEnhancing Displays. Model 3 replaces this interaction with an interaction between group and paedophilia\npredictions. These interactions are plotted in Figure 3.

Ex-Catholics, in other words, largely exhibited\noutright dismissal of orthodox Catholic beliefs.\nWe next examined whether past Credibility Enhancing Display exposure predicted the differences\nin belief between these groups. Both Credibility Enhancing Displays and clerical paedophilia predictions\npredict orthodox Catholic belief in models 2 and 3, Credibility Enhancing Displays positively and\nclerical paedophilia estimates negatively. In model 2, we found that exposure to Credibility Enhancing\nDisplays is predictive of orthodoxy within the Catholic group, but that these effects were reduced or\ndisappeared in the two Church-rejecting groups (Figure 4; simple slopes – Catholic, ß = 0.57, 95% CI\n= 0.41–0.73; liminal, ß = 0.14, 95% CI =−0.04–0.32; ex-Catholic, ß = 0.03, 95% CI =−0.10–0.16).\nModel 3 showed no significant difference across groups in effects of paedophilia, although the effects\nwere strongest in the Catholic group and disappeared in the ex-Catholic group (simple slopes –\nCatholic, ß =−0.07, 95% CI =−0.15 to −0.00; liminal, ß =−0.06, 95% CI =−0.12 to −0.00;\nex-Catholic, ß =−0.01, 95% CI =−0.06–0.04).\nAs can be seen in Figure 4, the interaction effects for ex-Catholics and liminal Catholics show no\nrelationship between level of Credibility Enhancing Displays and orthodoxy for these groups. Thus,\npast Credibility Enhancing Display exposure predicts whether people will reject the Church, but\nnot the levels of orthodoxy within the two ‘Church-rejecting’ groups (ex-Catholics and liminal\nCatholics).\n3.4. Credibility Enhancing Displays and adherence to Catholic morality\nAcross the groups, we see a similar but smaller difference in adherence to Catholic morality. Catholics\nhad a mean Church moral agreement score of 3.40 (SD = 1.39), liminal Catholics had a mean score of\n1.88 (SD = 0.93) and ex-Catholics had a mean score of 1.57 (SD = 1.04).\nNext, we ran regression models to see whether Credibility Enhancing Display exposure predicted\nacceptance of Catholic morality (see Table 3).\nWhen we look at the effects of Credibility Enhancing Displays on Catholic morality, we see that\nthere is a significant effect for Catholics (ß = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.08–0.52), which disappears in the\nex-Catholics (simple slope, ß = 0.04, 95% CI =−0.13–0.20) and reverses within the liminal group (simple\nslope, ß =−0.17, 95% CI =−0.42–0.07), and this effect is counter to what one might predict.\nLiminal Catholics who have been exposed to higher Credibility Enhancing Displays are in fact\nFigure 3.

Those who were exposed to fewer Credibility Enhancing Displays growing\nup were more likely to be ex-Catholics, were less likely to believe in God, and among those that\nremained Catholic, less likely to endorse orthodox Catholic beliefs despite the fact that almost the\nentire sample were educated in Catholic schools where they would have been regularly exposed to\nthese components of a Catholic worldview. Given the high number of those educated in Catholic\nschools, where children are exposed to religious discourse (frequently at the hands of press-ganged\nteachers with little interest in the subject) without much actual practice (Fischer, 2017; Scally,\n2021), and given clerical reports that the Catholic education system is essentially impotent at reproducing\northodoxy in the absence of domestic behavioural reinforcement by disengaged ‘culturally\nCatholic’ parents (Turpin, 2022), religious discourse alone appears to be insufficient to reliably transmit\nreligious belief. The effects of Credibility Enhancing Display exposure on orthodox Catholic mor-\nality were less clear.\nThe data also contain a number of interesting nuances which offer suggestive hints about Irish\nsecularisation. For a start, the perceived prevalence of clerical paedophiles is higher among both\ngroups who have rejected the Church: liminal Catholic and ex-Catholics. This suggests that both\ngroups have responded to clerical abuse scandals by adopting an attitude of moral contempt towards\nthe Church’s claims to authority. Despite this, leaving the religion entirely, rather than just rejecting\nthe authority of the Church, is uniquely predicted by lower domestic Credibility Enhancing Display\nexposure. This may relate to the fact that those with higher Credibility Enhancing Displays will associate\nCatholicism not just with a media-relayed image of abuse and hypocrisy, but also with potentially\nmore positive experiences of religion drawn from their families. Importantly, the liminal group may\nreject many of the specific teachings of the Catholic Church (transubstantiation and so forth), but\nmaintains a high level of more general belief in God, unlike those in the ex-Catholic group.\nLiminal Catholicism may well be a compromise position which reconciles a negative image of the\nChurch with ongoing Catholic affiliation and the maintenance of the central tenet of their religion:\nbelief in God. This provides some evidence that Credibility Enhancing Displays lead to higher maintenance\nof belief separate from mandated ritual behaviours and strong identification with one’s reli-\ngious institution.\nThis also supports the two-step process previously suggested for Credibility Enhancing\nDisplay-based religious decline. We should expect to see a generation of believers who forgo the costly\npractices of their religion, but maintain some belief, before we see rapid decline in belief itself\n(Lanman, 2012; Willard & Cingl, 2017). In Ireland, Mass attendance data and sociological work suggest\ndomestic religious socialisation is in rapid decline. This suggests that the liminal position of dis-\napproval for the Church combined with ongoing Catholic affiliation and maintenance of some\nreligious beliefs may be historically transitory. Those with a lower degree of domestic Credibility\nEnhancing Display exposure may simply have no commanding alternative associations with\nCatholicism, and no strongly established belief in God, to push back against the contaminated\nimage of the Church. There may be little reason why they would seek to salvage Catholic affiliation\nwhen it is both peripheral and contaminated. Given declines in religious practice and socialisation,\nthis suggests Irish ex-Catholicism and non-religion will grow further in the future.\nCredibility Enhancing Displays additionally predict levels of orthodox Catholic belief among\nCatholics, but less so for the other two groups. For the ex-Catholic group, this is probably unsurprising.\nEx-Catholics have probably explicitly rejected Catholic beliefs because these beliefs are symbolic\nmarkers of Catholic group identity. We have no data on how strongly they may have held these beliefs\nprior to their rejection, and thus no data on how much they were influenced by Credibility Enhancing\nDisplays prior to rejecting Catholicism. In other words, becoming ex-Catholic effectively wipes out any\nsignal of past Credibility Enhancing Display effects. It is more difficult to interpret the weaker relationship\nin the liminal Catholic results. Given their higher perceived prevalence of clerical paedophilia, it is\npossible that this group represents Catholics who have reacted more strongly to clerical scandals. They\nremain theists, but they have somewhat disassociated themselves from highly symbolic orthodox tenets\nthat are too closely linked to the (contaminated) authority of the Church. This may be a direct effect of\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 15\n', 'the Church’s hypocritical malfeasance on the plausibility of these representations, or it may be a\ndownstream effect of outrage or disgust. Either way would decrease any prior relationship between\nCredibility Enhancing Displays and orthodox Catholic beliefs (but not Credibility Enhancing\nDisplays and general theism). Thus, high perceived prevalence of the ‘Credibility Undermining\nDisplays’ of clerical paedophilia tends to reduce orthodoxy, but not general theism.\nThe data on Catholic morality was suggestive. To begin with, the smaller size of the between-group\ndifferences here as compared with the orthodox theological beliefs above probably relates to the fact\nthat the Irish population (including Catholics) has in general become more liberal than the Church\n(e.g. Amarach Research, 2012). We can see that the Catholic group’s moral agreement score is considerably\nlower than their orthodox belief score, and that liminal Catholics are much closer to\nex-Catholics on this measure than on the belief measure. One interpretation could be that while ontological\nbeliefs such as the Trinity or the Virgin Birth may appear implausible or bizarre, they are\nunlikely to provoke negative reactions among more liberalised individuals in the way that conservative\nmoral positions might. Ireland has had prominent referenda on abortion and same-sex marriage that\nhave pitted different normative stances against one another. It has not had socially divisive referenda\non whether God is Three Divine Persons in One, or whether Jesus was immaculately conceived.\nInterestingly, high Credibility Enhancing Displays in fact predicted the rejection of Catholic moral\nstances among the liminal group. This was an unexpected finding, but there are a number of plausible\nreasons why it may have been the case. The liminal category is probably a highly varied one, consisting\nof a range of positions from disengaged cultural Catholics to privatised devout believers who have\nretained their faith while leaving the Church. This effect within the liminal group might be suggestive\nof a stronger outrage reaction among those who have more exposure to Credibility Enhancing\nDisplays, and thus should have been more likely to remain within the Church. These\nhigh-Credibility Enhancing Display liminals might feel more betrayed by the Church’s failure to\nlive up to its own strict standards and thus less willing to endorse strict Catholic morality in turn\n(see Hilliard, 2003). They may also be liberal ‘deinstitutionalised Catholics’, i.e. devout individuals\nwho have rejected the dominant conservative wing of the Church in favour of a more liberalised\nand personalised style of Catholicism (Ganiel, 2016, 2019). Their rejection of Catholic morality, a\npoint of considerable social controversy and something that jars with the Church’s own moral failings,\nmay serve to project their status as ‘good’ Catholics who do not share the Church’s authoritarianism or\ncontamination. In contrast, given the strong cultural and historical links that still prevail between\nCatholicism and Irish ethnic identity, the low-Credibility Enhancing Display end of the liminal\nCatholic spectrum might be more representative of religiously disengaged but still socially conservative\nindividuals who retain Catholic group affiliation out of a sense of ethno-national belonging. More\nresearch needs to be done before we can be confident in these interpretations.\nAcknowledgements. None at present\nAuthor contributions. Both authors contributed to writing.
