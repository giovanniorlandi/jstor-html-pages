Chiefly due to lack of sys\ntem and the chaotic conditions which\nexisted during 1920, Russia export\ned but little in that time, the im-:\nports, however, being valued at 50,\n000,000 gold ruble\'s.\nRut as soon as trade agencies and\nrepresentations had gained a firm\nfooting in London. Berlin, Stockholm\nand other industrial centers, an ac\ntual system became apparent in the\nforeign trado ot soviet Russio, all\nbusiness being carried on under su\npervision of the people\'s commissar\nfor foreign trade, L.

In the same year;\nRussia exported goods valued at 20,\n000,000 gold rubles, chiefly flax and\nother raw. materials.\nEngland took the lead in supply\ning Russia with Its needs last year,\nwith Germany second.

G. E. Zinovieff told the last\nsession of the all-Itussion commu\nnist party congress.\nZinovieff is head of the third ln\nternationlae, president -of the Petro\ngrad provincial soviet, one of Pre\nmier Lentne\'s closest friends and the\nauthor of Lenine\'s biography. He is\na fiery, revolutionary crusader and\nin the soviet regime virtually has\nbeen dictator of Petrograd.\n"Our party has the monopoly of\nlegality," he said. "The danger of\nthis monopoly is that a number of\npeople are getting into the party\nwho would go into the petty bour\ngeoisie parties if such existed.\n"They are not coming into the\nparty with had intentions, and are\nhonest enough, but bring in bourge\noisie views. They are an active\npart of t lie population who like to\nparticipate in the economic and po\nlitical life of the country. We shall\nbe the monopolists of the legality of\nany party in this country for a\nnumber of years to ionip."\nM. Zineovfeff said it would be\ndifficult to clear ou this element\nof the party but, as the labor class\nmust "do in" the bourgeoisie, the\nparty\'s difficulties, no matter how\ngreat, in restoring Russia, should\nnot permit any unripe measures that\nwould lead to the restoration of\nthe Mensheviki or other bourgeoisie.\nMore . serious attention must also\nbe paid to the press, M. Zinovieff de\nclared, as the bourgeoisie writers\nare trying to got an independent\npress and, even Journalists regis\ntered as employes of the newspa\npers now permitted to operate (all\ngovernment controlled) are mostly\nof the old intelligentsia class.\n(lly AnNm-lnted I\'rennl\nYOSK.M1TE, May 19 - The senior\namateur diving championship of the\nPacific athletic association will he\ndecided Jime 16 in the Yosemlte\nlodge pool, in the Yosemite valley. ,\nDives will be made from two boards,\n; one at ten feet above the water, the\ni other twenty feet above.\nDon Hopper o Stockton, Cal., who ,\nis present holder of the P.

(lly\nMail.)---Before long the Swedish un\nemployed may have a chance to be\ncome independent farmers. When\nthey recently expressed the desire to\nobtain small farms of their own\nwhere they might work till old age\nwithout being subjected to enforced\nidleness, their request sounded at\nfirst like wishing for the moon.\nHut not so to the minister of ag\nriculture, who immediately ordered\nan investigation into the possibili\nties of forming a farm colony in\nthe. province of Soedermanland. If\nthe plan is found feasible, the gov\nernment may purchase land to be\nparceled among its unemployed. The\nproject would, of course, involve\nmore than acquiring the land. The\ngovernment will have to build cot\ntages on the farms, and supply its\nindigent citizens with live stock,\nfarm implements and living expenses\nfor the first year.\nThe farm project is one of the\nmost important and interesting of\'\nmany attempts for relieving the un\nemployment troubles of the country. \'\nLast winter several thousand job\nless were given instruction in almost\nany branch of learing in which they\nwere interested. Large appropria-;\ntions were set aside for doles and\nfor public works at which the other\nwise unemployed would be able to\nearn a living wage, and it was hoped\nthat conditions would soon become\nbelter. Nevtrtheless, unemployment\nis still the most serious problem of\nSweden, despite a slight decrease in\nthe number of idle.\nThe jobless still number more\nthan 150,0011, of whom about 65,000\nreceive aid. This number is higher\nthan was expected and in order to\nkeep within the budget, the unem\nployment commission and the gov\nernment have had to cancel during\nthe summer unemployment aid to\nunmarried men and women, all the\nfarm workers and fishermen. It is\nbelieved that these classes can shift\nfor themselves during the summer\nand pick up enough work to keep\nthem going. Married men, with fami\nlies, still draw stipends, while relief\nwork of all kinds is being planned.\nThe unemployment commission is\nlaying plans for extensive forest\nwork in cooperation with the forestry\nboard and the state domains depart\nment. Furthermore, about $200,000\nhas been diverted from the unem\nployment fund for buying paving\nstones to be placed at the disposal,\nfree of cost, of certain towns and\nhighway boards for the improve\nment of streets and roads, thus af\nfording employment to considerable\nnumbers.\nLos Angeles has declared war on\nsuper jazz.
