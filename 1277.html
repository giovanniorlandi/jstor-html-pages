        <pre>['THE EUREKA SENTINEL\n— II - . ".. 1 __ • _ ___,_\nESTABLISHED 1870____ EUREKA. NEVADA. OCTOBER 23.1920 _ ^jaiflfisHED SATURDAYS\nREPUBLICAN RALLY\nCandidates for National Offices From Nevada Address\nLarge Audience At the Eureka Theatre\nTasker L. Oddle, Republican can\ndidate for United States Senator, and\nSamuel 8. Arents, Republican candi\ndate for Congress, who are making i\ncampaign tour of the State, arrived\nL ]n Eureka from Ely about ( p. m\n[ Tuesday. The Republican Count]\nCentral Committee had announced\nand arranged for a meeting at th«\nEureka Theatre, and at 8 o’clock th^l\nevening the visiting candidates found\na large audience assembled to heai\nthem discuss the political Issues ol\nthe day.\nSeated on the stage were a numbei\nof Eureka’s representative Republi\ncans. District Attorney W. R. Rey\nnolds was chairman of the meetini\nand Introduced the speakers, both ol\nwhom received hearty welcomes and\nappreciative responses to the telllni\npoints made. After a few Introduc\nremarka, Mr. Oddle said In part:\nMR. ODDIK’B ADDRK88\nWe are on the eve of a great cam\npaign. When the smoke has cleared\naway we will all be In harness, pul\nling to carry through the policies ol\nthe Republican party. I don’t need\nto tell you that the consensus of opin\nion everywhere throughout the coun\ntry. throughout the United States, li\nthat Harding and Coolldge will b«\nelected.\nThe hand writing la on the wall\nYou know there le a great balance ol\npower In this country, a great body ol\nIntelligent, thinking people who\n■wing from one aide to the other,\nWhen an administration Is in powei\nand conducts Itself in an impropei\nmanner, that great balance of powei\nswings back and puts in another ad\nministration providing the people ar«\nconvinced that It will do the right\nthing, and that the candidates will do\nthe right thing by them, and that is\nwhat will be done this time. If the\nrepresentatives of the people have\nnot conducted themselves properly,\nit is up to the people to put them out.\nWe are not narrow minded in these\nthings. We want to look at them as\nthey are. We must face the condl\n, lions. Now, that that condition is\npresent. It Is the duty of every man\nand woman to look it squarely in the\nface, to analyze the situation, to look\nup the record of the administration,\nto look up the record of the candidate,\nto look up the record of the body\n\' which Is seeking to obtain power.\nThe present administration is about\nto give an account of its stewardship.\nThe Republican party is about to\nshow the people of the country that\nit will correct the faults of the past\nadministration. You know that par\nties are neceesary. They are a neces\nsary part of the great machinery of\ngovernment, and public opinion can\nbest be expressed through political\nparties. Now, to-day. there are two\ngreat questions that separate the par\nties\nrne nm IS pruiecuuu. in\npubllcana want a protective tariff.\nThe Democratic party opposes It on\nevery ground. They say that the\ntariff la a Joke. Now, we want to see\nabout that. We want to reach Into\nthe very vitals ot this qusetlon.\nComing down to the question of a\nprotective tariff. I want to say at\nthe start that we In mining camps\nare apt to think a little too much ot\nour own affairs, the affairs ot mining\nexclusively, without considering the\naffairs of other industries. We are\nnot so apt to realise that farming and\nlive stock Interests are vitally Import\nant, and when those Industries are\nnot prosperous the mining Industry\nwill not be prosperous. The three\nbasic Industries ot the State are min\ning, live stock raising and agriculture\nIt any of these suffer all will suffer.\nThey are Just like wheels In a great\nmachine. It they are all prosperous,\nthe machine works well and smoothly.\nIf one breaks, the machine stops and\nall are Injured. Do you realise that\nthe live stock Industry and the agri\ncultural Industry affect the merchant,\nthe professional man and the mechan\nic vitally. Look at it this way:\nWhen the purchasing power of the\nPeople is normal or high, every one\nIs prosperous and happy. When It Is\nlow or below normal every Industry\nwill suffer.\nYou realise that eight years ago\nwhen the Democratic party came Into\nPower the Underwood tariff law was\nPassed. You realise what happened.\nHlght after that tariff law went Into\n•kect over a million men were out of\nemployment and many of them were\nmilroad men. There was a depres\nsion everywhere. Industries closed\ntown and the people were sick. Then\nsomething happened that was un\nbooked for, something that was not\nIttpected, the great European war.\nThe war created a demand tor all\nkinds of materials and labor at hlgb\nPrices. You can understand thal\nbhat was an artificial condition. W«\ntope such a condition will nevei\nagain come to the worid. We want\na condition on which to build safely,\non which we can rely firmly and se\ncurely and not count on any war con\nditions to keep alive the industries\nof our country. Now, things are com\ning back again to the old standards,\nthe old conditions, and we must have\nsomething to strengthen them.\nThe live stock Industry Is suffering\nas I have told you. Why? Because\nof the tremendous lnportatlon of\nAmerican meats. Do you realize that\nthe great packers are Interested In\nthe South American cattle Industry?\nThat these cattle are being herded\nthere on South American plains by\nthe tens of thousands. Do you rea\nlize they are being herded by peons.\nThat they are trying to bring the\nstandard of the American herder\ndown to that of the peon. May they\nnever do It. We have a high stand\nard for labor and we want to do our\nbest to raise that standard. We don’t\nwant to bring them down to the level\nof the peons of South America. That\nmay not affect the miners. But, they\nmust remember that they have broth\ners out on the plains and mountains\nv« luu tauio. a u*zy arc\nnot comfortable. They are out In\nthe storm and the wind gathering to\ngether their herds. They don’t have\na comfortable bed. and a comfortable\nhouse, and a tempting meal spread\non the table. They have to brave the\nelements on such nights as these—\nand they have to keep at it. They\nhave to undergo hardships that we\nknow little about. I know about\nthem because I have had experience\nin this business. Those men are be\ning injured to-day. We are bringing\nthem down to the South American\npeon and it is not right. It is no more\nright than .0 bring our miners down\nto the status of the Chinaman.\nDo you realize that the sheep in\ndustry is suffering as well as the beef\nindustry. Do you know that 1,190,\n000 carcasses of mutton and lamb\nhave been imported from Auctralia.\nand South America and New Zea\nland since January, and that over a\nmillion more will come in during the\nnext six months. New Zealand has\n| 237,000,000 pounds of frozen mutton\nj and lamb in her warehouses and she\nIs preparing to ship it into this coun\ntry as fast as ships can bring it. Eng\nland has an amount of surplus wool\nin her own country equal to a two\nyears consumption of this country.\nThe woolen manufacturers of Eng\nland are not buying that surplus be\ncause they are preparing to buy the\n1920 crop from New Zealand and Aus\ntralia. This great surplus is coming\ninto the United States. Yet, we have\nto pay high prices for our clothes\njust the same. There are hundreds\nof millions of pounds of surplus wool\nIn Australia. New Zealand, South\nA m AvisA an/I A #*4/ta an/I aairantw .Awa\nper cent o( oar 1920 crop is unsold.\nThat means a depreciation In the\nsheep Industry. That will effect the\nmining Industry because the men in\nterested In sheep help carry on the\nmining Industry. We men know how\nthat is. When a prospect is found,\nmoney must be had to finance it.\nSome of our government institutions\nin Washington have been using for\neign beef from South America.\nFor years, our competitors, the\nDemocrats, have been very glad to\nsay that the Republicans have fav\nvored the big interests. Now. how\never, they will never be able to say\nthat again. Because, in the last few\nyears. In Washington the administra\ntion has favored them as they have\nnever been favored before and as they\nnever dreamed theywould be favored.\nIt has been done on a gigantic scale\nand at the expense of the American\npeople. It has been done at the ex\npense of the people who gave up their\nfortunes, of the people who gave up\ntheir all, gave unselfishly and un\nstintingly. A period of fraud and ex\ntravagance has gone on which has\nbeen scandalous, unequaled.\nDo you know, going back to this\nprotection, that the large beef pack\ners don\'t want a tariff on beef and\nmutton and lamb because they want\nto bring in the cheap foreign stuff.\nIf there was a tariff the Americans\nwould get the profit and not the for\neigners. Do you realize that the large\nsteel industries are opposed to the\ntariff on metals because they want\ncheap tungsten, cheap manganese and\ncheap vanadium from other coun\ntries. Our friend, Mr. Arentz, knows\nsomething about that. He encount\nered that in Clark County. He work\ned hard down there and he found\nenormous deposits of vanadium which\nwould mean the employment of large\nnumbers of men for years to come if\nthat would be developed. He found\nthe large steel industries would not\nconsider it at all because they could\nget cheaper vanadium from South\nAmerica where labor was cheaper.\nNow, my friends, we don’t want such\na condition to exist any more. We\ndon\'t want foreigners to take it all.\nWe want to give the producers a\nchance, to give labor a chance.\nMy opponent has promised to sup\nport protection—a Republican doc\ntrine. He has promised It all over\nthe State. He promised it to the cat\ntle men of Elko County a few weeks\nafo when they had a meeting there.\nBut, no matter how much he believes\nin it, and how much he wants to do it,\nhe cannot deliver the goods. If he is\nelected, he will be in duty bound to\nvote with his party in organizing the\nSenate. He will be in duty bound to\nvote with his party in all such vital\nthings. In that way the committee\nwill be made Democratic and the\nchances for a protective tariff will be\ngone. Now, that Is very plain. I\nwant you to understand It. The same\ncondition exists in Oregon. Senator\nChamberlin is the Democratic candi\ndate. He has promised protection,\nbut he is powerless to deliver the\ngoods.\nNow, the League of Nations I will\ntouch very lightly. It is a great and\ntremendous question. I want you to\nknow that I oppose that League. 1\ndon\'t stand for it. I believe in that\ngood old doctrine laid down by that\ngrand patriot, the father of our coun\ntry, George Washington. I believe\nthat we should keep out of foreign\nentanglements and I believe that we\nshould rule ourselves and not be\nruled by any great centralised mili\ntary power of the world, and I believe\nthat we should not be ruled by Japan\nand China and other European coun\ntries. I believe that one vote out of\nthirty-five is too small for America.\nI believe that America should have\na one hundred per cent vote in all af\nfairs that pertain to America.\nThere are many problems I would\nlike to discuss. The question of high\nprices, the high cost of living, we all\nwant to see that come down. We\nknow that if we had been running the\nGovernment we would have tried to\nbring it down. To bring it down to\nthe people, to a point where they can\nafford to buy \'things and to save\nsome money, but what has been done.\nThe selfish ^terests have controlled\nto such an extent that the prices have\nkept up and, my friends, it is a fraud\non the American people. Large sup\nplies of everything were on hand\nwhen the armistice was signed. Rea\nsonable purchases were all right.\nAnything that had to do with pre\nparing the army was all right. But\nthere were things done which were\nnot right, which were fraudulent and\nwere done in the interests of selfish\nindividuals, of the newly made mil\nlionaires. Is that right when the\nAmerican people have been giving\ntheir money to aid the war. Is that\nadministration acting as an honest\ntrustee of t!*e people and their inter\nests ?\nme country demandsacnange. tou\nhear this demand wherever you go.\nWe have traveled over this State for\nweeks and it is the same everywhere.\nThe demand is for a change, and a\nchange must come, and I beg of you\nwhen you are making this change to\nvote the ticket right down the line\nbecause it must be done this year.\nNow, I will Bay a few words about\nmy own position. I think I will ex\nplain to you very clearly that the mat\nter of greatest importance is the elec\ntion of a Republican Senator. My\npersonality has become small in com\nparison with the importance of elect\ning a Republican Senator. It is not\nso much a question now as to whether\nI am a better man than my opponent,\nor he a better man than I, but the\nelection of a Republican Senator from\nthe State who will be in accord with\nthe administration. I want you to look\nup my record and not take hearsay.\nMy official record can be had, and I\nrefer you to it. I refer you to my\nprivate record. Criticise me if you\nchoose. Search my record carefully,\nsearch my motives and give me a fair\ndeal.\nWhen Mr. Arentz was introduced\nby Chairman Reynolds, many of the\naudience present did not know that\nhe had sacrificed and provided for a\nwife and four children before enter\ning the service. Mr. Arentz entered\nas a private, but was quickly promot\ned to a captaincy on account of his\nknowledge of mining affairs, and an\nInborn capacity to control a body of\nmen. Arentz came out of the war\nwith an enviable record, and in his\nspeech said:\nMR. ARENTZ\'S REMARKS\n“I am an engineer and a miner,”\nsaid the candidate, “and I have had\nto hit the ball all my life. We get\nout of life, at best, only what we put\ninto it; and I will say to you that\nyou will get out of Congress Just\nwhat you put into it.”\nWe are all stockholders In the\ngreatest organization in the world,\nknown as the United States of Amer\nica. declared the speaker. Men elect\ned to Congress may be described aa\nbeing the board of directors of this\ngreat organization. Citizens and vot\ners should give at least as much at\ntention to the candidates for Senator\nand Congressman as they would de\nvote to a study of the character and\nability of men they would put in\ncharge of a mining, stockraising, or\nranching enterprise. But they don’t\nseem to do It. oftentimes.\nThe one Representative In Con\ngress allowed to Nevada, he said,\nshould be a man who understands\nthoroughly the problems of this\nState, and who has demonstrated that\nknowledge by works. He should be\nable to\' explain to members of Con\ngress the great difference between\nWestern problems and those of the\nEast, with which the great majority\nare more familiar. The West, and\nNevada particularly, has suffered In\ncalculable loss In advancement, be\ncause conditions here have not been\nmade sufficiently clear to theNatlonal\nlegislature.\n“Nevada has unlimited natural1\nresources," said Mr. Arents, "but ]\nthey have not been developed. We\nmust put homes on tne desert. Con- i\ngress has not known\' how to offer\npractical help to this end. Imprac- ■\ntlcal Irrigation and road-bulldi. g\nschemes have been acted upon, a*>a ■\nNevada has availed nothing frt 4\nthem."\nHe attacked the Democratic tarlff\nfor-revenue-only policy as being re\nsponsible for dormant mining condi\ntions in Nevada, because the product\nof Chinese and South American min\ners is admitted almost duty free.\n"Nevada miners refuse to attempt to\ncompete with Chinese coolie labor,”\nBald he.\nme bunion tax, me excess prom\ntax, the Income tax, and the increased\nrailroad rates, do rot correctly ap\nply to the mining business of Nevada,\nhe said, because the lawmakers at\nWashington do not t understand the\nbusiness they are lepring taxes upon.\nThey are considerlcg conditions of\nEastern Industries, he said, and try\ning to make one tax law to apply to\nalmost opposite sets of Industrial\nfacts.\nAmong other Illustrations the\nspeaker mentioned the case of the\nman who develops a mining pros\npect. This man may work for five\nor ten years, said he, suffering great\ndeprivations, expecting at the frui\ntion of his endeavors to have a prop\nerty from which he can realise good\npay for his years of work. But now\nthe excess profits tax comes In, and\nthe miner, If he tries to sell, must\npay the war tax on his years of work,\nthe same as the Eastern factory pays\non its products of to-day. This he\ndeclared to be unjust* It absolutely\nkills development of one of our great\nindustries.\n"The United States—you and I, all\nthe people of our country—are suf\nfering from a sense of deep unrest,”\nsaid Arentz. "We have been feeling\nwe do not know what is going to hap\npen to-morrow. We are making no\nplans beyond to-day. We are not\neven building necessary homes to\nhouse our people. We have lost con\nfidence in the administration of our\nGovernment. The remedy for this\ncondition is to elect an executive and\na Congress in which the people will\nhave confidence. Harding is the man,\nand his hands must be upheld by a\nSenate and House which will work In\nharmony with him.”\nIt were sheerest folly, said the\nspeaker, to elect a Republican execu\ntive and then proceed to tie his hands\nby voting for Senators or Represen\ntatives opposed to him.\nMr. Arentz mentioned feelingly\nthe condition of many ex-service men\n"who gave their all to go to the de\nfense of their country.” He said\nthey should be abundantly and sen\nsibly assisted or cared for, according\nto their needs. He pledged himself\nto work earnestly to this end. If elect\ned; and he Baid he believed be ap\npreciated the real needs of the boys\nbetter than one who had not seen\nservice.\nHe spoke of the internationaliza\ntion of labor as proposed In the league\nof nations, which would eventuate In\nlabor of all countries in the league\nbeing forced to a common level. ”1\nam for America first,” declared Ar\nentx, and the audience applauded.\nIn closing, the speaker declared the\npeople of the United States denounced\nthe Wilson administration and woi^d\nrepudiate it with a storm of ballots.\nWHITELEY TO »\nSUCCED COMERFORD\nGeorge Whlteley of Ely has wired\nhis acceptance of the appointment of\ndeputy superintendent of public In\nstruction of the second supervision\ndistrict of Nevada to W. J. Hunting,\nState superintendent, to succeed J. V.\nComerford, who recently resigned.\nThe appointment was made Saturday\ntaking effect the same day.\nWhlteley was an Instructor in the\nMcGill high sclfool for several years\nand last year completed a two-year\nterm of serving as district attorney of\nWhite Pine County. Since then he\nhas been conducting a private law\npractice there.\nThe second district comprises White\nPine. Eureka and Lander Counties.\nComerford is now connected with the\nSan Francisco school department.\nThe first known photograph was\nmade by Daguerre in 1820.\nEUREKA MINING NEWS\nKURKKA-CROE8US ^ *\nWince No. 8 of this property i«\nnow down GO feet, and the last 27\nfeet has been In ore of high values.\nWince No. 6 haa found good ore in\nthe fissure, while the shale raise is\nproducing dally its quota of shipping\nore. From week to week it is some\ntimes difficult to describe the opera\ntions of a property, but It is a satis\nfaction to record the discoveries of\nnew bodies of ore in holdings that\nwere profitable during the admlnis\ntlon of former days.\nEI\'REKA-HOIJjY\nOperations at the Holly mine con\ntinue to move along smoothly and\nregular shipments of high grade ore\nto the Utah smelters are going for\nward. The drift being run to connect\nwith the Bullwhacker workings is\nexpected to break through by to\nnight. It is learned that some delay\nhas been met with in obtaining the\nmachinery needed for the new mill,\nbut is is thought delivery will not be\ndelayed any great length of time.\nRUB* HIL.L\nReports from Ruby Hill are that\nthe Locan shaft has now been cleared\nof all water and muck down to the\ntop timbers of the station below the\n1200 foot level, but the quantity and\nnature of the muck in the bottom of\nthe shaft is somewhat retarding pro\ngress. The volume of water making\nin the shaft is considerable less than\nwas expected, and little trouble in\nhandling it after the new station is\nput in is anticipated.\nDRY LEADER INJURED\nRev. E. F. Jones, prominently con\nnected with the Anti-Saloon League\nof Nevada, accompanied by his wife,\nwas a visitor in Eureka last Sunday,\ncoming here by auto from Elko. They\nleft Eureka Monday morning for Aus\ntin, and it is learned that when In\nthe vicinity of the Willows, about 30\nmiles west of Eureka, their auto\ntipped over and the accident result\ned in the dislocation of Mr. Jones’\nshoulder. His wife, who was the\nonly other occupant of the car, re\nceived minor injuries. They were\ntaken on to Austin for treatment. No\nfurther particulars regarding the ac\ncident ha,ve been obtained.\nDEATH OF BERNARD MARLO\nBernard Mario, a resident of Eu\nreka County since 1872, died here\nThursday, October 21, from the in\nfirmities of age. During his early\nresidence he engaged in charcoal\nburning, and later in mining, which\nhe followed until Incapacitated. For\nmany yearB he made his home at\nProspect, but since failing health\ncame upon him he has lived in Eu\nreka.\nHe was a native of Italy and aged\n78 years, 5 months and 1 day. He\nwas without known relatives. The\nfuneral took place Friday and the in\nterment was in the Catholic cemetery.\nORE SHIPMENTS THIS WEEK\nThe following carload shipments of\nore and speiss to the Utah smelters\nhave been made over the local rail\nroad this week:\nFour cars by the Eureka-Holly.\nSix cars of speiss by the Richmond\nEureka.\nSUIT FOR DIVORCE\nA suit for divorce was commenced\nin the District Court this week by\nFlorence Aguirre against Manuel\nAguirre, on the grounds of cruelty.\nNO MONDAY TRAIN\nUntil further notice Eureka-Ne\nvada Railway trains out of Eureka\nfor Palisade will leave the depot on\nSundays at 8 a. in., and there will be\nno trains leaving Eureka on Mondays.\nM.

Her\nman Bremenkampt, Vida Kitchen and\nJulia Hildebrand will take the affirm\native, while Katie Tamblni, Pauline\nHjul and Annie Porch, the negative.\nAs there is ample material for each\nside, and the subject appropriate, the\ndebate will probably be very inter\nesting.\nOn Wednesday morning ex-Gover\nnor Tasker U. Odcjle and Samuel S.\nArentx, were high school visitors.\nBoth Mr. Oddie and Mr. Arentx made\na brief address to the student body.\nMr. Oddie spoke of the wonderful op\nportunities for advancement in the\nworld which lie before high school\nstudents of the present day. He\nalso made It plain that hard work Is\nthe foundation upon which all suc\ncessful men and women build their\nsuccess in life. He went on to give\nexamples of several successful men\nof the present day who began life un\nder the most difficult and trying con\nditions and showed how much bet\nter a chance the high school student\n\' of to-day has to succeed in life than\n; many of these men had. It is up to the\nstudent of to-day to take advantage\n1 of the opportunities offered if he or\nshe wishes to succeed, said Mr. Oddie.\nMr. Arentz in a fine speech dis\ncussed Nevada, its large area, and Its\nwonderful resources. As an example\n! of the wide variety of climate in this\nState, he said that only a few days\nago while in southern Nevada he had\nseen almond trees loaded with nuts\nas well as large fields of cotton near\nLas Vegas. He Bald that if Nevada\nwas divided up there would be more\nthan a square mile of territory for\nevery person in the State. "Think\nwhat that means,” said Mr. Arentz,\n“ a square mile of territory for ev\nerybody in Nevada. This square mile\nmay contain a valuable mine or be\nthe making of a wonderful ranch."\nHe also brought out the fact that the\nhigh school is a preparatory course\nfor every one, no matter what path\nof life he or she may later decide to\nenter.\nEDWARD SKILLMAN, Reporter.\nSAYS HENDERSON WILL WIN\ni\n(WELLS HERALD)\nUpon the occasion of his visit here\nlast week Congressman Evans made\na large number of new friends in\nboth parties who are openly support\ning him. Mr. Evans spent a day here\nand circulated among the people,\nquietly getting acquainted and letting\nthe voters know JuBt where hestands:\n“For Nevada and her interest*" He\nhad no paid press agent with him to\nburn much midnight oil in conjuring\nup something nice to say in the Reno\nGazette, but he is gathering in votes\njust the same. The people like Con\ngressman Evans. He has been con\nstantly on the job In Washington, al\nways ready to care tor the interest ot\nanyone who asked him to attend to a\nmatter of business, and there are\nhundreds in Nevada who have been\nassisted by him in various capacities.\nThey will not forget his assistance in\ntheir behalf and the speed with which\nhe has brought their pleadings before\nthe various departments. From here\nthe Congressman went to Deeth,\nwhere he attended the campaign bail,\nand made a splendid impression. He\nproved that he knows how to dance,\nas well as attend the official duties at\nWashington, and carried away with\nhim the promise ot lots ot votes down\nthat way. While here Mr. Evans\nstated to this paper that the propa\nganda being spread over the State by\nthe Republican press to the effect\nthat Senator Henderson is in grave\ndanger of being defeated by Oddie is\nall bunk. Wherever he has gone,\nMr. Evans stated, he finds a very\nhealthy Henderson sentiment. He\ncommended the article published last\nweek in the Herald entitled “Let us\nnot change horses in the middle of\nthe stream,” and said every word of\nthat pleading was true. He added\nthat it would be very disastrous for\nNevada to change horses now. “In\nSenator Henderson," Mr. Evans said,\n"the people of Nevada have just the\nman they should keep in the Senate.\nThey are extremely fortunate that\nthey have such a progressive, wide\nawake, energetic, likable, able and in\nfluential man in the Senate as Sen\nator Henderson has proved himself\nto be. I reiterate, It would be dis\nastrous for Nevada to change horses\nnow. Keep up the splendid work\nyou have begun In pleadnig with the\npeople to support Senator Henderson\nand you will have performed a public\nservice far beyond your belief. The\nvoters of Elko County, if they know\nhim as I do, would vote solidly tor\nhim. He is entitled to every vote in\nthe county.” —Advt.\nSubscribe for the “Sentinel"\nmine wnnrs\nJ \' ELEmimat\nWomen, Labor, Voters Tired\nof Old Parties, Support\nWoman Independent\nThe indications now are that Ne\nI vada will elect the first woman and\nthe first Independent to the U. 8. Sen\nate. These are the signs which point\nto this result:\nA majority of Nevada people are\ndissatisfied with both old parties.\nThey know that big business controls\nboth Democratic and Republican par\nties and wrote both party platforms\nin the interests of the money power.\nThey know that neither Oddla nor\nHenderson, pledged as they are to\nthese platforms, can do anything for\nthe people. They see both candid\ndates are committed to tetereeta\nwhich exploit the people. Theee vot\ners art turning to me, th* Indepen\ndent candidate, free from big busi\nness control and pledged to fight the\nprofiteers to lower the cost of living.\nThe fear Is now expressed by Od\ndie supporters that I am drawing so\nheavily from Republican votes as to\ndefeat Mr. Oddte. Henderson sup\nporters fear I am drawing so heavily\nfrom Democratic votes as to defeat\nMr. Henderson. Both are right. 1\nam drawing so heavily from the two\nparty candidates that I will defeat\nthem both.

Dana Tells How Ab\nraham Lincoln Maneuvered\nTo Secure Admission\nIn an article In the Literary Digest\nthqre appears a story taken from\nCharles A. Dana\'s works which has\nspecial reference to the admission of\nNevada to the Union.\nThe article in question is headed\n“Vast Power of the American Presi\ndent” and deals with the activities of\nPresident Wilson In war times, in con\ntradistinction to the methods em\nployed by his predecessors.\nReference to the Nevada situation\nis as follows:\n“And the President—if he has a\ngenius for politics, and many a Presi\ndent has possessed that gift—can\nsometimes actually control the mak\ning of laws, and there is no more il\nlustrative instance of this than Lin\ncoln\'s maneuvers to secure the adop\ntion of the thirteenth amendment,\nwhich freed the slaves. Charles A.\nDana tells the story:\n" \'In order thus to amend the con\nstitution it was necessary first to have\nthe proposed amendment approved by\nthree-fourths of the States. When\nthat question came to be considered\nthe issue was seen to be so close that\none State more was necessary. The\nState of Nevada was organized and\nadmitted into the Union to answer\nthat purpose. I have sometimes heard\npeople complain of Nevada as super\nfluous and petty, not big enough to\nbe a State; but when I hear that\ncomplaint I always hear Abraham\nLincoln saying, “It is easier to admit\nNevada than to raise another million\nof soldiers.”\n“‘In March, 1864, the question of\nallowing Nevada to form a State gov\nernment finally came up in the House\nof Representatives. There was strong\nopposition to it. For a long time be\nforehand the question had been can\nvassed anxiously. At last, late one\nafternoon, the President came into\nmy office, in the third story of the\nWar Department.\nuaua, uo oatu, x aui 101;\nanxious about this vote. It has got\nto be taken next week. The time is\nvery short. It is going to be a great\ndeal closer than I wish it was.”\n“ \' “There are plenty of Democrats\nwho will vote for it,” I replied ."There\nis James E. English of Connecticut;\nI think he is sure, isn’t he?”\n“ ‘ "Oh, yes; he is sure on the mer\nits of the question.”\n“ * “Then,” said I, "then’s ’Sun\nset’ Cox, of Ohio. How 1b he?”\n” * “He is sure and fearless. But\nthere are some others that I am not\nclear about. There are three that\nyou can deal with better than any\nbody else, perhaps, as you know them\nall. I wish you would send for them.”\n" ’He told me who they were; it is\nnot necessary to repeat the names\nhere. One man was from New Jer\nsey and two were from New York.\n.What will they be likely to\nwant?” I asked.\n" * "I don’t know,” said the Presi\ndent; “I don’t know. It makes no\ndifference, though, what they want.\nHere is the alternative: that we car\nry this vote, or be compelled to raise\nanother million, and I don’t know\nhow many more men, and fight no\none knows how long. It is a ques\ntion of three votes or new armies.”\n“ • "Well, sir,” said I, "what shall\nI say to these gentlemen?”\n" ‘ “I don’t know,” said he; "but\nwhatever promise you make to them\nI will perform."\n" ‘I sent for the men and saw them\none by one. I found that they were\nafraid of their party. They said that\nsome fellows in the party would be\ndown on them. Two of them wanted\ninternal revenue collector’s appoint\nments. ‘You shall have it,’ I said.\nAnother one wanted a very Important\nappointment about the customs house\nof New York.

October 14. — Miss Al\nleen Joyce, who waa graduated from\nBethany college, Topeka, a year ago,\nis the new girl in the Lyric theatre\nchorus here—the fourth from the left.\nMiss Joyce tried teaching school\nfor a year, but she had to walk a\nmile to her school In a rural district\nof Kansas, found the work hard and\nthe salary meager.\nBesides, she didn’t have any fun\nwhile teaching young America read\nin’, ’rltin’, and ’rithmetic. So, while\nvisiting relatives here this Summer,\nshe found the opportunity of getting\ninto the chorus at the local theatre—\nand took it. And she’s glad she did.\n“Teaching school, especially in the\ncountry, is a poor life and a hard\none," said Miss Joyce. “The stage Is\nhard work, but it offers one a chance\nof advancement, and a better living.\nIt gives a girl a bit of amusement and\na touch of adventure. There\'s a cer\ntain lure about the footlights that the\nclass room will never possess.\n“I suppose all the girls in the sor\nority house where I lived while at\nBethany woulc^ be shocked if they\nknew I was out here in the West,\ndancing before a crowd of perfect\nstrangers in a chorus girl’s costume.\nBut, anyway, it\'s a better life than\nteaching.”\nKEROSENE IN “GAS"\nBoston, Oct. 21.—A chemical an\nalysts of gasoline now sold motorists\nshows that It Is better than 50 per\ncent kerosene, according to Informa\ntion received here.

It is true that\nthe tax laws need revision, says the\nSalt Lake Tribune, but let no man\ndelude himself into the belief that\nhe is going to escape the payment of\ntaxes in some form. We came out\nof the world war with a debt of near\nly twenty-five billions of dollars, and\nwe must pay the Interest even if we\nallow the debt to hang over us for all\ntime to come. We shall never re\nturn to the "good old days," If such\nthey really were. Prices will never\nreturn to the pre-war level and wages\nwill remain high. Just now the coun\ntry Is passing through a very trying\nperiod. The cofon and wheat grow\ners, as well as the cattle and sheep\nmen. are said to be losing money.\nMerchants and manufacturers are\nalso making entries on the wrong\nside of the ledger. Such conditions\nalways arise immediately following a\nwar. and there is no escape. The\nGovernment has no power to act in\nthe premises, even If It should so de\nsire.

B. Gray, registrar of the Fed\neral land office at Carson. Mr. Gray\nis spending a vacation in Reno and\nboosting the possibilities of Nevada\nland for agricultural purposes at the\nsame time.\n"There are millions of acres open\nfor settlement in this State.” he said.\n"These are waiting some method of\nirrigation and men with nerve are de\nveloping in many sections. Settlers\nhave proven that wells will furnish\nwater in northern Humboldt, Washoe\nand Clark Counties and there are\nthousands of acres in that section\nawaiting settlers, who can obtain\nland for the asking under either the\nhomestead act or the Pittman act.”\nMr. Gray calls attention to the\nfact that six or seven firms in other\nStates are advertising to locate set\ntlers on Nevada lands and are doing\na good business. “Their business is\nlegitimate,” he said. “But it seems\nstrange that farmers will pay a dol\nlar and a half an acre to be located\non land they can take up for them\nselves. It might be a good idea for\nthe State to advertise such land as\nit becomes taxable when settled.\n“A man in Oakland” he continued,\n"advertises Nevada lands and locates\nhomesteaders in Rebel Creek, Hum\nboldt County, district. His partner\nconducts a store at Rebel Creek at\nwhich the settlers obtain their sup\nplies. The two men charge $1.50\nan acre for their work and have done\nconsiderable business in the past\nyear. Other real estate firms in\nGrldley, Calif., Los Angeles, Boise,\nIdaho, and other cities have been lo\ncating settlers in Elko, Humboldt,\nPershing and Washoe Counties. All\nof these concerns seem to be doing a\ngood business and are bringing set\ntlers into Nevada rapidly.\n"During the months of July and\nAugust," said Mr. Gray, “permits\nto prospect for water were Issued and\ndelivered to applicants covering more\nthan 100,000 acres of sagebrush land,\nand if fifty per cent of the applicants\nshould be successful in developing\nwater for irrigation of twenty acres\neach so as to raise agricultural pro\nducts at a profit it will mean 12,500\nacres of deeded land for taxation;\nand the opening for 160-acre home\nsteads where it is known water can\nbe found, or 37,500 acres of public\ndomain.\nMr. Gray estimates that 5,000 ac\nres of land are being applied for each\nweek by men anxious to develop wa\nter and secure a home under the Pitt\nman act.\nThe registrar says Nevada should\ntake some steps itself to obtain new\nsettlers for tbe available tracts. Some\nof the advertisements of Nevada land\nread like fairy tales, he explained.\n“The Government is investigating\nsome of those concerns now, but all\nseem to be complying with the law.\n"There is one man in San Antonio,\nTexas," he said, "who advertises that\nlie is agent for 2,000,000 acres of\nNevadu land bordering on southern\nCalifornia. His advertisements state\nthat lemons, oranges, peaches, pears,\napples, peanuts and sweet potatoes\nran be grown; that the climate is\nabout the same as Los Angeles. At\nthe time he first advertised, he had\na copy of the Pittman act and plats\nof two townships of Clark County.\nThe advertisement has been referred\nto the Federal bureau of investiga\ntion, but so far there has been noth\ning wrong found.”\nLegal blanks for sale at the “Sen\ntinel” office.\nNOTICE\nThe Nevada Transportation\nCompany has concluded to\ntry to run a daily train in and\nout of Eureka (except Sun\nday), and if the people want\n_ continued they will have\nto cease using the Parcels\nPost; otherwise the service\nwill be returned to tri-week\nly ; and this will not alone be\ndone, but we will have to\nfight the Post Office Depart\nment a new way, and make\nthem put on a stage line.\nOur pay has been reduced to\nless than $100 per month\nfrom what the stage line re\nceived—about $7000 per an\nnum.\nI think it will pay every one\nto see that the express is\nused, if they wish the Ne\nvada Transportaion Com\npany to continue to give\nthem a six day service.\nJ.

Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\nand California. The replies, of course.\n, are only a small fraction of the total\nnumber of voters, and it is entirely\npossible that any or all of these States\nmay go overwhelmingly for Cox on\nNovember 2. We merely collect and\ntabulate the figures with entire im\npartiality and present them for what\nthey are worth. The electoral votes\nof these six States total 140, or more\nthan half of the 266 votes necessary\nfor a choice by the Electoral College.\nIn 1916 all of them except Ohio and\nCalifornia went to Hughes. This\nyear our trial ballot indicates, if any\nthing, that Harding will show a gain\nover the Hughes vote in all six States,\nwhile the Cox vote runs behind the\nWilson\'vote of 1916 in all but Indi\nana. Other campaign barometers are\nalso busy with predictions. Thus we\nhave the confident assertion of such\na veteran observer and political diag\nnostician as Col. Henry Watterson,\nwho declares that Governor Cox is\n••unbeatable." The New York Eve\nning Post, however, supporting the\nCox candidacy, conceded on October\n1 that “if the election were held to\nday Senator Harding would score a\ndecisive victory.” At that time, ar\ngued the Post, Republican prospects\nwere at high tide, but with signs of\nebb beginning to appear. Among\nthese signs of ebb it cited the acute\nfactional strife in the Republican\nranks in several States, Including Ill\ninois and West Virginia, and the in\nability of Republican leaders to re\nconcile their differences of attitude\ntoward the League of Nations. The\nNew York Times (Ind. Dem.) also\ngloats over the belief that “no day\npasses without adding to the mental\nconfusion and the moral mlx-u^ of\nthe Republican party and its Presi\ndential candidate in the matter of the\nLeague of Nations"; and it paints for\nus this picture of the Republican\nlandscape as viewed through Demo\ncratic glasses:,\n“Pale are the once so rosy gills of\nRepublican hope. October spreads a\nfrost over the sweet June dream. In\nIllinois, how are Lowdenites and\nThompsonltes, who have been flying\nat one another’s throats for months,\nto be brought together in unity be\nfore the Tuesday after the first Mon\nday in November? The Inheritance\nof an old scandal clouds Republican\nprospects in Missouri. The vision of\na Republican Kentucky is dissolving\nintQ air. From Indianapolis Mr. Car\nter Field tells the Tribune of the\ndoubts and fears of the Hoosler Re\npublican managers. They are in doubt\nabout Ohio and in doubt about Indi\nana. Western Republicans are even\nwumcu awuui now •*01 doj auu\nYork.\n“In California, and In every other\nState, for that matter. It is evident\nthat the effort of the Republicans to\nhe both for and against the League\nis breaking down. It would be mighty\nconvenient if the Orand Old Party\ncould carry water on both shoulders\nuntil Election-day. Unfortunately,\nthere are hundreds of thousands of\nRepublicans, and there may be even\na few Republican politicians, who are\nreluctant to swallow their convic\ntions and display no readiness to put\nup with the easy ambiguities and the\ndouble-faced attitude of the party.\nInterest in the League of Nations is\ngrowing, and will grow.”\nOn the other hand, the New York\nOlobe, an independent paper support\ning Harding, thinks that the man\nagers of the Cox-Roosevelt campaign\n"have abandoned all hope of making\na showing in New England, New York,\nNew Jersey. Pennsylvania, and Del\naware, thus giving the Republicans\n144 electoral votes by virtual de\nfault.” A month before Election\nday this paper reported that the out\nstanding features of the campaign\nwere “the drift to Harding in the\nEast and the sudden revival of hope\nfor Cox in the West and Middle\nWest.”\nThe figures of our poll, as tabulat\ned to date, speak for themselves—\nalthough we will not know how au\nthoritatively until after the election.\nThese figures reveal a striking in\ncrease in the Socialist vote, which\nseems to be about doubled in Indiana\nand Ohio, tripled in New Jersey. Ill\ninois, and California, and almost mul\ntiplied by five in New York, where\nthe Socialist Assemblymen were un\nseated. Not shown in the tabulation\nare eight votes for W. W. Cox, can\ndidate of the Socialist-Labor party,\nand fourteen for Robert C. Macauley,\nthe Single-tax candidate. A further\nevidence of a certain drift away from\nthe old parties is the vote of 1,331\nfor Christensen, the Farmer-Labor\ncandidate.\nDespite the fact that nation-wide\nprohibition is now a thing accom\nplished, the Prohibition candidate\nseems to poll more votes in these six\nStates this year than in 1916.\nInteresting side-lights on the polit\nical situation this year are supplied\nby remarks written on some of the\nreturned ballots, especially on those\nsent in by voters who have not yet\nmade up their minds. On one we\nread: “I am a woman born and\nbred a Republican, but can not give\nmy first vote against the League.”\nA man who voted for Hughes in 1916\ninscribes his ballot thus: "On the\nLeague, Democratic; on candidates,\nno choice.” To set against these we\nfind others who chafe at being denied\nthe opportunity to vote for “Hiram\nJohnson and no League compromise.”\nTO DISCUSS FLOTATION\nMILLING PROCESS\nInterest among the mining men of\nthe Nation runs high regarding the\nplans for the first conference ever\ncalled to discuss the alleged oppress\nive practices of the great trust which\nclaims to control every known method\nof ore recovery by what is known as\n“flotation."\nNearly 1500 mining companies\neither known as users of flotation, or\nwho have tried to secure contracts\nwith Minerals Separation, Ltd., have\nbeen invited to attend the conference\ncalled by the American Mining Con\ngress in< Denver during the week of\nNov. 15. Hundreds of these com\npanies are facing costly legislation\nand millions in alleged royalties and\nfines are involved In suits now pend\ning. America\'s leading legal experts\nare fighting, for and against the big\ncorporation which the Federal Trade\nCommission is now grilling, urged by\nthe American Mining Congress which\nbelieves that the methods of theTrust\nshould be changed, or the practices of\nthe company looked into by Congres\nsional inquisition.\nThe Denver conference is in charge\nof a special committee of mining op\nerators composed of George E. Col\nlins, Governor of the Colorado Chap\nter; Philip Argali of Denver, T. A.\nRickard, publisher of the Mining A\nScientific Press, of San Francisco;\nE. E.

Jobbers,\nand speculators, says the Journal.\nIt is proposed to contract with inde\npendent mills for the manufacture of j\nall virgin woolen cloth and perhaps ‘\nblankets and sell them direct to the\nconsumer. The principal Idea in this\nis to show the people that there has\'\nbeen an enormous toll taken from the\ntrade by the several middlemen and\njobbers and also to show the differ\nence between an all-virgin woolen\ncloth and one made from the large\npercentage of shoddy. The officers\nof the National Wool Growers’ Asso\nciation find that such contracts can\nbe made. It is also thought that a\nmarket organization can be devel\noped.
