It Is re- J\ngarded that there will be nearly as\nmany women voters as there are now j\nmen voters In the county and In sev\neral precincts this will bring the num\nber of voters aboue the limit fixed by\nlaw necessitating the division of the\nvoting precincts.\nIn the city of Maysvllle every ward\nin the city will have more than the\nlegal limit and It will therefore be\ncome necessary for the six wards to\nhave at least two voting precincts in\nstead of one as at present thus giving\nthe city of Muysville twelve voting pre\ncincts Instead of six. There are also\nseveral precincts in the country dis\ntricts which are now almost up to the\nlegal limit and these precincts will\nhave to be divided.\nAnother change that will seem quite\nstrange will be the appearance of\nwomen election officers in the polls. At\nthe next meeting of the Mason County\nElection Commissioners this is ex\npected to come up for consideration\nand at the presidential election in No\nvember several women will likely be\nseen at the polls during the day as offi\ncers. It is pointed out that this will\nbe a great relief as there has been con\nsiderable trouble in the past In pro\ncuring men who would serve as elec\ntion officers.\nCOAL LAND BARGAIN.\nWe have for sale 6,000 acres of the\nfinest coal and timber land in Eastern\nKentucky, located on a railroad line.\nThere are seven velng of coal on this\nland and the main vein Is seven feet\nthick.

The requirements\nare such that the teachers may from\nlime to time step up from one class to\nanother until they reach class A. Un\nder the salary schedule applied under\nthis classification ,all teachers will re\nceive approximately 25 per cent, in\ncrease In salary next year and some\nwill get even more. This salary scale\nand classification schedule was worked\nout by the teachers themselves. Miss\nGray and Professors Berry, Noel and\nCalkins being a committee chosen by\nthe teachers to draft the system which\nis quite fair and yet Increases the ef\nficiency of the local faculty and gives\nthe members some incentive to in\ncrease preparation.\nThe Finance Committee presented\ntheir tentative budget which will go to\nCity Council. This budget shows that\nthe board will need $50,573 from the\ncity for next year and In this connec\ntion a resolution levying a tax of 75\ncents for school purposes and an extra\n20 cents to retire school bonds was\nadopted by the board.\nAll oX the present teachers were re\nelected and Miss Margaret Schirmer,\nof Ghent, Ky., now at Peabody Uni\nversity, was elected as teacher in the\nHigh School. It was also ordered that\ntwo extra teachers, one for the Fifth\nward school and one for the East End\ncolored school be employed. As there\nwere no applications these .positions\nwill be filled later.\nPetitions from the citizens of the\nSixth ward asking; (or a new school\nbuilding were presented and filed and\nthe Property committee was Instructed\nto get an estimate on the cost of an\nadequate building and a suitable lot\nlo hold It for presentation to Council\nwhen a bond issue will be asked for\nby the board.\nPetitions from citizens of Eastland\nasking to be taken into the city for\nschool purposes only were presented\nand thoroughly considered.

(Special cor\nrespondence) To meet tho conven\nience of the public In making small\npurchases Senators George P. McLean,\nof Connecticut and Joseph 8. J"lolng\nhuysen of New Jersey, advocate the\ncoinage of two-cent pieces, seven-cent\npieces and eight-cent pieces. The de\nmand. for pennies to make change has\nbecome enormous. With the use of the\nnew coins, as proposed, It would be\neasy to make the odd combinations re\nquired for buying many small articles.\nThe minting of a two-cent coin Is pro\nposed in the McLenji bill as a memo\nrial to Theodore Roosevelt It would\nbe made of copper allow somewhat\nlarged In slzo than the penny though\nnot like the old cart-wheels coined as\ntwo-cent pieces more than a quarter\nof a century ago. On the face of the\ncoin would appear the bust of Colonel\nRoosevelt stamped In relief. It Is not\nspecified In the bill proposed by Sena\ntor Freyllnghuysen what may be the\ndesign of the seven and eight-cent\npieces. They would be made of nickel\nalloy similar to that which now forms\nthe five-cent piece. The McLean bill\nfor the coinage of two-cent pieces has\nbeen favorably reported to the Senate\nby the Committee on Banking and Cur\nrency. The bill for the coinage of the\nBeven and eight-cent pieces was re\ncently Introduced by Senator Rrey-linghuysen.\nI\'SE CARE IN BEDIIIXU\nSWEET POTATOES.\nSomething like seventy-five thou\nsand women in the United States are\nengaged in cultivating fruit, among\nthem being several of California\'s most\nsuccessful fruit-growers.\nIf you wish to have sound sweet po\ntatoes next fall, it will pay to give at\ntion to the potatoes bedded for seed\nthis spring.

This\npast year It has sold for from 4 cents\nto 7 cents a bushel higher than the\nmixed corn.\nDue to the larger demand in the\nSouth for pure white corn, particularly\nfor milling purposes, many mills pay a\npremium above the market price for\npure white coru of a high -grade, and\nthe difference in price in Southern\nmarkets la always much greater than\non the Chicago market.
