With\nthe expressed selfish intentions Hint\nhave lHen expressed regarding man\ndates, cables, the spoils of war, and\niiiciul equality, it becomes Increasingly\napimrcut that the United States has\nmuch to lose and little to gain.\nIn the matter of disarmament. It\nstrikes the average American thnt\nEuropean and Japanese views are In\nsincere ami selfish. The burden of re\nducing armament Is paced wholly on\nthe United Slates.

By Its own tiihuliltmits it Is\ncalled Hellas, a It was also In anti\nquity, and the name (inw, hy which\nin one form or another it is known In\nmoot European languages, was riven to\nit hy the Romans, and was not used\nhy any Greek writer, so fur as we\nknow, before Aristotle.\nlenes dwelt, and the latter times, after\nPhilip of Macedon obtained a seat at\n(lie Aniphlctyonic council, it meant the\nwhole peiilumila south of the Balkan\nmountain including Macedonia and\nThrace ; hut at the period of Its great\nest distinction It excluded these two\nregion, and was restricted to the part\nof the peninsula to the south of the\nCaiubuulnn ranee and the Inlands of\nthe surrounding seas. Ita ancient lira\nIts, however, cannot be rigidly defined\nfor (1) Ita northern frontier seems to\nnever have been precisely settled, some\nwriters excluding Thessaly which was\ngenerally tukeu In, and other excluding\nEplrua which was generally left out\nand (2) the name Hellns expressed not\nso much a geographical as an ethno\nlogical unity. It was the country of\nthe Hellenes. Wherever Greeks were\nthere was Hellas, and a Greek colony\nin Sicily or Africa was thought to par\ntlclpate as essentially in all that con\nMl lint (I Hellas aa either Attica or\nIjieodacmon. Still the name was usu\nally applied to the lund which formed\nthe goograpldcal center of the race.\nThe modern Greeks are of very com\nnoslte origin, yet are an" extremely\neomnact and homogenous people. Out\nof more than two-millions .which con\nstitiite the present population of the\ncountry, only about eight-five thousand\nspeak any other language than Greek\nand only twenty thousand profess any\nother religion thnn the orthodox; and\nall draw well together, glorying In one\nanother in the same memories of a\ncommon deliverance, ami snaring in\nthe same ambition of a great future.\nThere are in the Isiunda of Greece\nthree distinct ruces, speaking different\nInngnages, wearing different costumes.\nobserving different customs, and hold\nlug but little social Intercourse with\none another. These raws are the\nGreek, the Albanian, awl the Wsllaeb\nIiiii. All three are probably much mix\ned in blood, and, In fact, the descent\nof each of them has lieen a very vexing\nproblem In ethnology, but on the whole,\nthe suggi-stlon of Freeman seems the\nmost likely account of the matter\nthat taking them all In nil, these three\nraces are the direct representatives of\nthe three races which occupied Greek\nterritory at the time of Its conquest\nby the Unmans.\nSince that time their blissl has cor\ntnlnlv been minded with other ele\nments, but still substantially. trsv an\ncient Greek is the base of the modern\nGreek, the lase of the modern Alban\nian is the ancient Illyrlnn. and the\nbase of the modern Walliiehlan Is the\nancient Thraelan.\nThe national character of the Greeks\nis a matter noon which authorities\ntake very contrary views, some Ideal\nizing them foolishly, and others depre\nciating them most unjustly . They\nseem to have the faults and the vir\ntues of their fnmoim ancestors. They\nWhr the Itomsns called It so Is an\nobscure point but the most probable ! "ve their qnlckness of parts and their\nuuil nstiallr sccci.te.1 einhiAation is moderation liaraeier. luey nre\nthat tbey gained their first knowledge ouMtlve. full of mental activity, foul\naa In the daya of Plato, and as eager\nafter novelty aa In the days of Paul.\nTheir thirst for knowledge Is Indeed\nquite remirkable, as well as their apt\nness to earn. Boya will put themselves\nto any discomfort In order to get to\nschool.\nGreece haa an admirable legal sys\ntem, which la the one good thing it has\ngot from the Bavarians. It Is based\non the old Roman law, with modifica\ntion drawn from the Bavarian and\nFrench. liberty of person and domi\ncile Is Inviolate; no one ran be appre\nhended, no house can be entered, no\nletter can be opened without a Judicial\nwarrant. Criminal and political of\nfences are tried hy Jury. The com\nmercial code Is Identical with that of\nFrance.\nThe religion of the people and of the\nstate Is that of the orthodox Greek\nchurch. In fact, the Greek rite Is not\nonly the national religion, but per\nbaps the deepest and most creative\nfactor in the nationality of Greece it\nself. Men of Greek bliss I who do not\ntelong to the Greek church do not\nidentify thcnikclrcs with the Greek\npeople." The moslems of Crete were\nthe sternest oppressors the Greeks\nknew, and the tatlns of Hyrna sided lit\nthe revolution with the Turks, yet both\'\nwere of the purest Greek descent. And\nwhat makes the Greek and Sklpetar of\nthe modem kingdom all equally Greek\nIs their sympathies today In their com\nmon profession of the Greek rite. Hut\nall other eligions are tolerated in\nGreec".\nThe early history of Greem is the\nfirst chapter In the lolitlcnl f.nd Intel,\nlectual life of Europe. In contrast\nwith nations still In the trllal stage\nthe Greeks have already the life of\ntitles; In contrast with tlr despotic\nmonarchies of tha East they rccoguUc\nthe principle that no personal rule\nshould lie unlimited.

I\'erbapt they did\nnot belong to organized labor, but un\ndoubtedly they were qualified to do so.\nThey bare rights that we are bound to.\nrecognize just as much as any other\ngroup of men who wore the uniform.\nSome post of tbe Legion In the Unit\ned States have seemingly overlooked\nthat fact and In so doing have deprived\nthe Legion of tbe support of many men\nwho are eminently qualified to carry\nforward the principles of the I-eglon.\nI desire at this time to call your at\ntention to Article II. Section 1, of the\nConstitution of The American Legion,\nwhich reads as follows:\n"The American Legion is a civilized\norganization; niendsrship therein does\nnot affect nor Increase llblllty for\nMILITARY or POLICE service."\nIn addition to this section of the\nConstitution, I want to remind yon\nthat it has been the boast and policy of\nthe American Legion that we are a\nNON PARTISAN organization. I also\ncall your attention to tbe policy of the\nNational Organization as announced by\nour National Commander, Y. W. Gal\nbralth, Jr., which Is as follows:\nThe American Legion has taken a\nvery positive stand that, ns an organi\nzation It should never take any defin\nite part In any dispute between the\nemployer and employee, or lictwccii\ncapital and lalsir. This policy shall lie\nadhered to strictly by the National or\nganization, state organizations and the\nposts ns well.Tbere Is nothing to\nprevent the indlvldiinl mcmlK-r, ns nn\nindividual, from taking either side In\nsuch a controversy, but The American\nLegion, should not do so."\nThe American laboring man of todaj\nIs Just as Intelligent and. In general\nJust ns patriotic as any other man. As\na matter of fact, organized labor Is the\nnation\'s chief safeguard against Itol\nshevtsm. We must always remember\nthat ninny, many meinliors of organized\nlabor fought side by side with tbe rest\nof us to establish the principles of\ndemocracy In the world; thnt those\nwho stayed nt home sacrificed Just ns\nmuch ns those of any other cliiss who\nstayed at home.
