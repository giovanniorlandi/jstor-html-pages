In the past the\nRussian Federation and the U.S. have moved through a number of cycles where phases of\nrapprochement have given way to intensified strategic competition. This pattern could\nreproduce itself if a momentum of expanded cooperation is not sustained. Today, in critical\nareas such as democratization and respect for human rights, arms control, counter\nproliferation, energy security, and regional stability, conflict is becoming more\npronounced. If the reset agenda is to lead forward to a more substantial redefinition of the\nU.S.-Russian relationship these underlying sources of conflict will need to be addressed.\nFor the promise of rapprochement to be realized the U.S. and its allies must look beyond\nthe limited goals of the reset as originally defined towards a strategy of more comprehensive\nengagement designed to bring Russia into the fold as a cooperative member of the\nWestern security community.\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Regents of the University of California.1. Introduction\nThe Five-DayWar between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 brought relations between the two former superpowers to\na post-Cold War nadir. “Russian–American contradictions”, in the words of a Russian commentator, “reached their apogee\nduring the crisis in the Caucasus of August 2008” (Baranovskii et al., 2009). The war and its outcome (a crushing defeat for\na U.S. ally and screeching halt to the momentum of NATO enlargement in the region), made clear that the U.S.–Russian\nrelationship had disintegrated to a point where Washington was no longer in a position effectively to leverage Russian\nbehavior.\nThe conflict demonstrated the risks of uncontrolled rivalry and gave rise to an effort to place relations on a more stable\nfoundation. U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden set the tone in February 2009, calling for both parties to “press the reset button”\n(Whitlock, 2009). The recasting of Russian–American relations initiated by the administration of Barack Obama and dubbed\nthe reset agenda was a serious diplomatic initiative, and it has borne fruit. (Gottemoeller, 2008). At their first meeting as\nheads of state during April 2009 presidents Obama and Dmitri Medvedev issued a joint statement identifying more than\ntwenty areas of cooperation (Fedynsky, 2009). One year later, Medvedev’s visit to the U.S. gave rise to commitments to expand\ncommercial relations and included a much publicized stop in California’s Silicon Valley, posed as a model for Russian\nmodernization (Gvosdev, 2010). In May 2009 Russia’s new national security strategy stated that “Russiawill strive to establish\na complete and balanced strategic partnership with the USA on the basis of shared interests” (Strategiia natsional’noi\nbezopasnosti Rossiiskoi Federatsii do 2020 goda, 2009).\nThe atmospherics of the relationship have improved. Public diplomacy and civil society initiatives designed to break down\nstereotypes and encourage understanding are underway under the aegis of a U.S.–Russiaworking group (Samarin, 2010; IREX\nConvenes US and Russian Civil Society Discussions, 2011). Policy intellectuals are actively developing scenarios for expanded\ncollaboration (Valdai Discussion Club, 2011). A foundation has been laid for long-term civil-nuclear cooperation (US–Russian\n123 Agreement, 2011). Russia now collaborates with the U.S. stabilization effort in Afghanistan, allowing transit of non-lethalier Ltd on behalf of The Regents of the University of California.\n', 'R.C. Nation / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 45 (2012) 379–387380supplies and personnel into the theater along a “Northern Distribution Network” traversing Russia through overland routes\nand air corridors (Gjelten, 2011). The New Start treaty which entered into force on 11 February 2011 has revived arms control\nas a dimension of U.S.–Russian cooperation. Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization in December 2012, strongly\nsupported by the U.S., was the culmination of a long effort to “cement the integration of Russia into theworld economy” (Jolly,\n2012). The key U.S. external alliance has joined the game as well – the NATO Strategic Concept approved at the Alliance’s\nLisbon Summit in November 2010 stresses the importance of “a true strategic partnership between NATO and Russia” (Active\nEngagement, Modern Defence, 2010). In the summer of 2010 Russia agreed to support UN Security Council resolution 1929\nstrengthening sanctions against Iran, and canceled a planned sale to Tehran of S-300 surface to air missiles.\nIf the goal of the reset policy is characterized as “a strategic reassessment of the United States’ relationship with Russia\nwith an emphasis on exploring common interests” it may be said to have succeeded in its own terms (Bipartisan Committee\non US Policy toward Russia, 2009). The reset is cited by the Obama administration as one of its most notable foreign policy\nachievements. Overt hostility has been bled away, shared interests are being pursued in discrete areas, and prospects for\ncontinued and expanded collaboration do not lack (McFaul and Collins, 2010). But the picture is not entirely rosy. Russian–\nAmerican relations have cooled over the past two years, with both sides placing greater emphasis on areas of discord. The\nreset has opened up space for modest collaboration, but it has not transformed relations in a fundamental way. Reversion to\nmore hostile patterns of interaction remains within the realm of possibility.\nIndeed, the Russian–American relationship has been characterized by cycles of détente and disintegration for some time.\nThe two parties concluded the Second World War as allies, though more by accident than design. The onset of the Cold War\nwas in part occasioned by ideological differences, but also by structural rivalry born of competitive bipolarity. U.S. cold war\nstrategy, inspired by the idea of containment, was consistent but not inflexible. Periodic thaws in superpower relations\n(peaceful coexistence under Nikita Khrushchev, détente under Leonid Brezhnev, New Thinking under Mikhail Gorbachev)\nalternated (and sometimes overlapped) with phases of enhanced tension (Nation, 1992).\nFollowing the breakup of the USSR, the foreign policy of the new Russian Federation was launched on the basis of\na presumed strategic partnershipwith the U.S., a promise that, in the words of one critic, the U.S. foreign policy establishment\nembraced “without reserve, in the naïve belief that the new Russia would be transformed overnight into a democratic, loyal,\nand above all unquestioning, supporter of Western policy” (Braithwaite, 1994). These hopes were quickly disabused. The\nviolent confrontation between forces loyal to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and refractory members of the Russian\nparliament in October 1993 made clear that the new Russia was not a mature democratic partner, and turned the administration\nof William Clinton toward more assertive policies. On the Russian side, the replacement of foreign minister Andrei\nKozyrev by Evgenii Primakov in January 1996 symbolized a return to a less conciliatory orientation (Rossiiskaia gazeta, 1997).\nFrom 1995 onward U.S. intervention in the wars of Yugoslav secession, and the decision by NATO to enlarge into areas\nformerly dominated by Soviet power in Central and Eastern Europe, became sharply contested issues. The cycle of\nrapprochement and regression repeated itself in the first decade of the new century. Following the 9/11 attacks the\nadministration of Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to rally to the support of the U.S. in the name of a common\ncommitment to oppose global terrorism. Within several years a series of issues, including U.S. concern for authoritarian\ntendencies in Putin’s Russia, ongoing NATO enlargement, and rivalry for access to the hydrocarbon reserves of the Caspian\nbasin, had produced what some came to call a “new cold war” (Lucas, 2008).\nThe reset agenda represents yet another effort to reconstruct U.S.–Russian relations on the foundation of mutual interests.\nDespite many successes, the limits of the policy orientation have become more evident over time, and Russia’s relations with\nthe U.S. and its keyWestern partners have slipped backwards. Vladimir Putin’s reelection to a third term as Russia’s president\nin March 2012 has been interpreted by some as an indication of harder times to come (Finn, 2011). Could the kind of pressures\nthat have sabotaged phases of rapprochement in the past once again provoke intensified strategic rivalry? Such an outcome\nwould be in neither country’s best interest, but it will become more rather than less likely if the reset agenda does not lead\nforward to more ambitious transformations. Cyclical patterns in U.S.–Russian relations reflect more than occasional conjunctural\ncrises or the foibles of individual leaders. The Russian–American relationship has been and remains structurally\nunstable, for reasons that need to be explored and addressed.\n2. Sources of discord: domestic governance\nRussian political culture rests on a long tradition of authoritarian governance. Democratic transition in the post-Soviet\nperiod had very little to build on. Nonetheless, the process has produced a stable constitutional order with an elected\npresidency, bicameral parliament, and constitutional court; expanded personal freedoms for average citizens; and\na reasonably open press. In historical perspective these things might be considered meaningful achievements. Academic and\nmedia coverage of Russian affairs in the U.S., however, has chosen to concentrate on the failures of transition, and in particular\nthe strong state philosophy and “soft authoritarianism” of the Putin years. Russia’s purported authoritarian drift has become\nan important source of Western resistance to the integration of the Russian Federation into Western institutions (Hanson,\n2007).\nConcern about authoritarian tendencies in contemporary Russia has an objective foundation. Putin’s March 2011\nannouncement of the intent to campaign for a third presidential term served to crystallize the perception that Russia has at\nbest a sham democracy with procedures manipulated to ensure the continued dominance of an uncontested strong man\n(Harding, 2011). In May 2011 a public declaration signed by prominent figures in Russian cultural life decried “the virtually\n', 'R.C. Nation / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 45 (2012) 379–387 381complete destruction in our country of democratic elections as such” (Timakova, 2011). The results of the Russian legislative\nelection of December 2011, which allowed the governing United Russia party to retain its dominant status in the State Duma\ndespite a decline in support, were widely denounced as the result of falsification. Speaking in the immediate aftermath, U.S.\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton called for “a full investigation of electoral fraud and manipulation” (Hillary Clinton Calls\nRussian Election Unfair, 2011). The Russia Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded with an official statement describing Clinton’s\nremarks as an “unacceptable” product of “long outdated stereotypes”, while Prime Minister Putin castigated them as\na “signal” to opposition leaders inspired by “a well-known scenario” designed to destabilize and weaken Russia itself\n(Ministerstvo Inostrannykh Del Rossiiskoi Federatsii, 2011; Elder, 2011). The pointed exchangewas an indication of the kind of\nimpact that trends in Russian governance, and the manner in which they are interpreted and responded to in Washington,\nmay have on efforts to normalize U.S.–Russian relations. The December election has been followed by a sequence of public\nprotests sponsored by the anti-Putin opposition that may well become an enduring feature of Russian political life.\nThese issues concern matters of political culture and domestic governance that in principle should lie outside the purview\nof interstate relations. The U.S. has coexisted comfortably with allies that have sustained one-party regimes over decades\n(Mexico, Japan, Egypt, etc.). Do Russia’s imperfect institutions have strategic implications that make them relevant in the\ndomain of international affairs? For some the answer is an unambiguous yes. Authoritarian governance, it is argued, distances\nRussia from the Western community of values, enables profound corruption that makes her an unreliable economic partner,\nand serves as a source of imperial ambition within the post-Soviet space (Romaniuk, 2009). These conclusions may be\ndebated, but there is no doubt that they are influential. Much has been made of the difference in tone between outgoing\nPresident Dmitri Medvedev, who while in office consistently articulated an agenda for deep modernization, and the “hardliner”\nPutin, accused of indulging in the exploitation of windfall profits derived fromRussia’s oil wealth in order to consolidate\npersonal power (Krumm, 2010; Rossiia XXI veka, 2010; Medvedev, 2009). This distinction too can be called into question.\nMedvedev is exposed to the same kinds of criticisms as his mentor, to whom he has remained loyal. For example, the Russian\nrocket designer Iurii Solomonov has decried excessive dependence on foreign technology and disruption of state defense\norders underMedvedev, and suggested that without stronger leadership Russia could end up “just a large territory withmany\nnuclear weapons” (Goszakaz, 2011 goda uzhe sorvan, 2011). In the wake of the decision not to run for reelection, Medvedev\nexpressed unqualified support for Putin while reiterating the case for reform (Medvedev prizval podumat’ o bol’shom\npravitel’stve, 2011). It is by no means clear that Putin’s third mandate will be inspired by dramatically different kinds of\npriorities (Ivanov, 2011). Nonetheless, Putin has a penchant for anti-American rhetoric, perceived to play well with a portion\nof the Russian electorate, but also no doubt an expression of conviction. His remarks before a youth conference in the summer\nof 2011, characterizing the U.S. as “living beyond its means” and a “parasite” on the global economy, is a typical example (Putin\nSays U.S. is a ‘Parasite’ on Global Economy, 2011).\nTrends in American governance and political culture also impact negatively upon bilateral relations. Political division and\nconflicting priorities are perceived to make the U.S. a less than reliable international partner. Uncertainty about the outcome\nof the 2012 U.S. presidential contest leaves Moscow with lowered incentive to commit to an agenda for cooperation that\nmight be abandoned by an Obama successor. With the legacy of the Cold War still alive a significant current in American\nstrategic culture continues to demonize Russia as “an evil dictatorship irrevocably committed to undercutting U.S. interests\nand reestablishing complete regional hegemony” (Charap, 2010). Such sentiments are often based upon vulgar stereotypes, or\nintentionally overstated “beyond any sense of proportion, waged with the purpose of undermining the nation’s political\nreputation” (Tsygankov, 2009). Russia’s authoritarian tradition is nonetheless a reality. Perceptions of a values gap are both\ncredible and powerful. Such factors place significant barriers in the way of transformational initiatives designed to bring\nRussia into the Western community of nations.\n3. Sources of discord: strategic priorities\nThe New Start treaty was long overdue. Together Russia and the U.S. control over 90 percent of the world’s nuclear\nwarheads and have an evident interest in reinforcing strategic nuclear stability. The terms of the agreement, which limit each\nside’s deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1550 (over 50 percent lower than the limits defined by the 1991 START treaty),\nand define a robust verification regime, will contribute to that goal in meaningful ways. The treaty is also important for its\nsymbolic value as a first step toward renewed Russian–American cooperation. But it is only a first step in what should be\na long journey.\nThe New Start accord is intended as the prelude to subsequent rounds of negotiations where more difficult issues will be\nplaced on the table (Pifer, 2009). These include the challenge of tactical nuclear weapons, stockpiled weapons, U.S. prompt\nglobal strike capacity, third country nuclear systems, counter proliferation, and missile defense – all areas where U.S. and\nRussian priorities diverge. In some cases differences are profound and virtually intractable.\nBy postponing deployment of interceptor missiles and radar systems in Poland and the Czech Republic in favor of smaller\nSM-3 interceptors to be initially deployed at sea, the Obama administration energized its reset agenda and revived the idea of\nbringing Russia into a cooperative missile defense endeavor. Unfortunately the initiative has flagged. The U.S. Ballistic Missile\nDefense Review Report issued in February 2010 describes a long-term commitment to missile defense as an essential\ncomponent of national defense policy (Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report, February 2010). Repeated assurances, by U.S.\nUndersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Fournoy and others, that the commitment is “not intended to affect the strategic\nbalance with Russia” have fallen on deaf ears (Garamone, 2010).\n', 'R.C. Nation / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 45 (2012) 379–387382Russia does not oppose collaboration in principle, but favors a step by step approach to commence with a common threat\nassessment, followed by the identification of political and economic measures capable of averting threats, and only thereafter\ndiscussion of the joint deployment of a functional ballistic defense system. This timeline is regarded by the U.S. as a diversion.\nThere are serious concerns about what opportunities collaboration in technical sectors might pose for Russian intelligence\ngathering, and powerful figures in the U.S. strategic establishment who want to preserve autonomy in decision-making and\nhave no interest in cooperation whatsoever. As a result prospects for any kind of comprehensive U.S.–Russia missile defense\nprogram have dimmed. In confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Michael McFaul, currently\nU.S. ambassador to Russia, described cooperation on missile defense as “at an impasse” (White House Nominee for\nAmbassador to Russia Vows Deep Support for Civil Society, 2011).\nThe status of Russia’s tactical nuclear systems is also problematic. At present Russia’s large tactical nuclear arsenal stands\ncompletely outside of any arms control regime, a state of affairs that the U.S. would like to change. Unfortunately, Russia has\nmade both strategic and tactical nuclear systems the foundation of its entire national defense posture. TheMilitary Doctrine of\nthe Russian Federation states that nuclear weapons are considered to be “an important factor for the prevention of the\noutbreak of nuclear conflicts and military conflicts that use conventional assets” and asserts a first strike option in cases\nwhere “the very existence of the state comes under threat” (Voennaia doktrina Rossiiskoi Federatsii, 2010).\nAt present the arms control calendar offers few prospects for expanded collaboration. Deep cuts in strategic arsenals\nbeyond the New Start limits are not envisioned for the time being, and would in any case require the inclusion of China, and\nprobably other nuclear weapon states, an unlikely eventuality (Perkovich and Acton, 2010). Russian analysts share President\nObama’s sympathy with, but pragmatic skepticism about, the prospects for Global Zero. In the terse conclusion of one analyst,\n“the geopolitical conditions that would make it possible to carry a program for total nuclear disarmament through to\ncompletion are not yet in place” (Anichkina, 2011).\nRussia and the U.S. have divergent views of the role of nuclear weapons in national defense policy and in 21st century\nworld order. Contrasting priorities emerge from the gap inwealth and technological acumen that has opened up between the\ntwo former antagonists, their different positions in regional and global contexts, and the contrasting strategic cultures that\nanimate defense policies – powerful structural determinants that will be difficult to change. The U.S. is more open to strategic\ninnovation, less concerned with the traditional logic of mutual assured destruction, and increasingly focused on the challenge\nof proliferation as a primary threat that missile defense capacity can at least partly deflect. Russia maintains a traditional view\nof the centrality of strategic deterrence, fears the potentially destabilizing affect of a functional missile defense capacity\ncontrolled by the U.S., and relies heavily on its tactical nuclear arsenal as a foundation for territorial defense. Russia is\naggressively modernizing its strategic nuclear arsenal in ways that the U.S. is not (Russland will Raketenproduktion praktisch\nverdoppeln, 2011; Payne, 2010). Putin’s sweeping agenda for Russian rearmament, released on 17 February 2012 in the midst\nof his re-election campaign, calls for the acquisition of no less than four hundred new ICBMs and eight strategic ballistic\nmissile submarines over the next ten years (Putin, 2012). Putin’s aspirations may prove to be beyond reach, but the logic of\nRussia’s desire to sustain a competitive strategic posture is not likely to change.\nIn all probability the Kremlin will resist further cuts in its strategic arsenal that might call its deterrent capacity into\nquestion, continue to modernize its systems to make their deterrent function credible, hold fast to its tactical systems, and\noppose U.S. sponsored missile defense programs that it is not in a position to oversee or control. Divergent strategic priorities\nborn of contrasting strategic cultures make it unlikely that arms control can continue to serve as a motor for a dynamic of\nrapprochement.\n4. Sources of discord: regional order in the new Eurasia\nRussia has been the great outsider in efforts to construct a cooperative security order in post-Soviet Europe and Eurasia.\nAccording to Zbigniew Brzezinski, the entire future of post-Soviet Russia will be decided by its choice of geopolitical\norientation, with Moscow admonished to abandon a presumed Eurasian heritage, align with the West, and join Europe. “The\npolitical struggle within Russia”, Brzezinski wrote in 1995, “is over whether Russia will be a national and increasingly\nEuropean state or a distinctively Eurasian and once again an imperial state” (Brzezinski, 1995). In fact neither option has been\non offer. Russia was never presented with the realistic prospect of joining Western institutions, but when in 1996 Foreign\nMinister Primakov sought to articulate an Eurasianist alternative, including the assertion of a Russian sphere of influence in\nwhat was then referred to as its “Near Abroad”, the aspiration was greeted like a declaration of war (Rogov, 1998).\nNo other aspect of the U.S.–Russian relationship has been so divisive. Russia has not turned away from the claim to what\nPresident Medvedev famously referred to as its sphere of “privileged interest” in the post-Soviet space, and uses its\nconsiderable assets (energy dependency, security assistance, labor remittances, market access) to impose its will (A\nConversation with Dmitry Medvedev, 2008). The U.S. and its allies reject what are regarded as Russia’s hegemonic aspirations,\nand have worked in various ways to draw the new independent states of post-Soviet Eurasia closer to the West.\nInitiatives have included the enlargement of both the European Union and NATO, the Partnership for Peace program\npromoting security cooperation programs under NATO auspices, the European Neighbourhood Policy, the EU’s Eastern\nPartnership, launched in thewake of thewar in Georgia and intended to promote relations between the EU and six “strategic”\nactors in Central Europe and the Caucasus (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan), as well as various\ninfrastructure and pipeline projects designed to bring the hydrocarbon resource of the Caspian basin into Western markets\nwithout transiting the Russian Federation. Competition for influence in Eurasia has taken on the contours of a zero-sum game.\n', 'R.C. Nation / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 45 (2012) 379–387 383After the so-called Colored Revolutions (the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003 and Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004),\ninterpreted in Moscow as the result of Western-sponsored subversion, it became a dangerous game, with the Five DayWar in\nGeorgia the result. For the moment the effort to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO has lost momentum, but Russian\nsources attribute this to international overexposure and domestic constraint rather than a meaningful redefinition of longterm\nU.S. priorities (Troitskii, 2011). In summaries of the achievements of the reset, the observation that “the Obama\nadministration continues to have serious disagreements with the Russian government over Georgia” sounds a discordant\nnote (The White House, 2010). Geostrategic competition in Eurasia is a dimension of Russian–American rivalry that the reset\nagenda has to date failed to address.\nRussia is objectively marginalized in the Eurasian security architecture that has emerged after the Cold War. The NATORussia\nCouncil gives Moscow a voice but little real influence within the Atlantic Alliance, where Russian national priorities\n(in cases such as the Kosovo question, reactions to the Arab Awakening, or the issue of militarization in the Arctic region) are\noften not aligned with the alliance consensus. Influential voices have called for a breakwith half measures and the integration\nof Russia into the Alliance as a full member (Rühe et al., 2010; Fischer, 2009). This would represent a virtual revolution in\nsecurity affairs, but a critical mass of support for the idea is not in place on either side.\nRelations with the EU have been contentious, due in part to the European desire to make democracy and human rights\npriorities for pragmatic cooperation, and in part to Moscow’s perception of the EU “as a competitor in the former territory of\nthe Soviet Union” (Dettke, 2011). The EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement originally concluded in 1994 expired\nin 2008 and is still being renegotiated. Divergent European attitudes toward Russia make a common EU policy in the spirit of\nprivileged partnership difficult to achieve and sustain (Wilson et al., 2009). The construct “strategic partnership” that was\napplied to EU-Russian relations in the mid-1990s is now described as “exaggerated” (Fisher, 2008). Moscow has placed more\nemphasis on bilateral ties with key European allies, and aided by energy dependency and expanding commercial relations has\nexperienced some success. On occasion real breakthroughs have been the result – evenMoscow’s long time Polish antagonist\nnow asserts the need to pursue a “strategic alliance” or “reliable partnership” with Moscow (Mink, 2010; Sikorski, 2010). On\n17 June 2011 Russia concluded a record-breaking deal with France, purchasing two Mistral class assault ships/helicopter\ncarriers for $1.4 billion, with options for further purchases, the largest ever deal between a NATOmember state and Russia. On\nthe same day, Germany concluded a $398million contract to develop a combat training facility for Russian ground forces. One\nU.S. commentator, in panic mode, describes these initiatives as “a new Rapallo”, but in fact they amount to something much\nless ambitious (Cohen, 2011). Improved relations with individual European partners may expand Russian leverage, but will\nnot open the door for Russia to institutional Europe or the European community of states.\nWith limited prospects in Europe, Russia has sought to reinforce its Eurasian identity by sponsoring a number of multilateral\nregional forums, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Eurasian\nEconomic Community and associated Customs Union, and Collective Security Treaty Organization. None of these forums\nrepresents a mature and reliable security community. Russia’s 2010 proposal for a new, treaty-based Eurasian security\nframework that would link East and West in a cooperative forum and seek to institutionalize something like the Cold War\nideal of a “zone of peace from Vancouver to Vladivostok” was rejected out of hand by the U.S. and other Western partners\n(Proekt dogovora o evropeiskoi bezopasnosti, 2009; K novoi arkhitekture evroatlanticheskoi bezopasnosti, 2009). The latest\nvariation on this theme is the Eurasian Union project announced by Putin in October 2011, seeking to bring together Russia,\nBelarus, and Kazakhstan (and potentially other state members in the future) in a “unified economic space” to serve as the\nfoundation for “a powerful supranational union capable of becoming one of the poles of the modern world” (Putin, 2011).\nThese are extravagant expectations, but it is more likely the Eurasian Union will end up as yet another overly ambitious\nattempt to institutionalize a Russian sphere of interest in the post-Soviet space.Western analysts, predictably but not unfairly,\nhave been quick to criticize the project as “premature” and unlikely to take off before Russia itself has achieved “greater\nsuccess in its domestic modernization and other reform efforts to become a more attractive economic partner” (Weitz, 2010).\nRussia’s close ties with China can be interpreted as an attempt to balance against a Western security community from\nwhich it has been effectively excluded. It is a robust relationship that has been defined since 1996 as a “strategic partnership”,\ninstitutionalized in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and based upon a strong foundation of shared interests.\nThese include a convergence of world views, economic complementarities, and a determination to thwart U.S. ambitions in\nthe Asia-Pacific region. The Obama administration’s articulation of a new U.S. strategic focus in Asia, widely interpreted as an\nadmonition to Beijing, may have the effect of reinforcing Beijing’s commitment to a stable strategic relationship with the\nRussian Federation (Clinton, 2011; Cossa et al., 2009). Alignment with China brings Russia an important trade partner and\nsource of capital investment, markets for arms and hydrocarbon resources, stable relations with a powerful neighbor, and\na potential strategic ally. China obtains secure supplies of critical resources, military hardware, diplomatic support in\ninternational forums, and cover for its expanding engagement in Inner Asia. Both Russian and Chinese political leaders and\npolicy analysts place a great deal of weight upon the relationship (Rossiia i Kitai v novoi mezhdunarodnoi srede, 2009). In\nBeijing during his first state visit following the announcement of the intention to stand for the Russian presidency in 2012,\nPutin boasted of the “deep friendship” and “comprehensive strategic cooperation” that defined Russian–Chinese relations\n(Lorenz, 2011).\nDespite these outward signs of alignment, Russian–Chinese relations are subject to significant strains. Trade patterns are\nimbalanced, and Medvedev has expressed concern that Russia could gravitate toward the humiliating status of “a raw\nmaterial base” for Asia (Medvedev: Far East Ignored too Long, 2008). There is a significant cultural divide, aggravating by\nRussia’s rapid shift in status from dominant to junior partner. Moscow is unhappy with increasing Chinese engagement in\n', 'R.C. Nation / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 45 (2012) 379–387384Inner Asia and the Caucasus, but unable to counter. Differences over priorities lie just beneath the surface of the SCO and in\ngeneral the power balance is perceived to be moving to China’s advantage and Russia’s detriment (Mikheev, 2005). Russia’s\nstrategic convergence with China is both a reality and a necessity. But it does not provide an alternative point of geopolitical\norientation for the Russian Federation, or a reliable counterweight to the West (Brækhus, 2007).\nRussia’s interests in the new Eurasia are a logical product of the state’s history, geography, and cultural orientation. In the\npost-Soviet period, lacking reliable allies or firm allegiances either East or West, Moscow has sought to defend these interests\nby binding its neighbors to new kinds of centralized authority structures, redefining the area as a kind of chasse gardée capable\nof serving as the basis for a more independent exercise of power on the global stage (Trenin, 2011). Strategic competitionwith\nthe West has been a predictable consequence. This is a competition that Russia cannot hope to win, not so much due to\nWestern push back as to the tenacious commitment to the exercise of sovereignty on the part of her Eurasian neighbors. And\nthe enterprise will not be risk free. The Caucasus and Central Asia in particular are volatile regions subject to bouts of\ndestabilization. So long as Russia remains without a fixed geopolitical anchor, such as only full association with the West can\nrealistically provide, Eurasia will function as a geopolitical shatterbelt, fragile socially and politically, contested by external\nactors, subject to periodic crises, and a barrier to efforts to broaden accommodation with the U.S.\n5. Sources of discord: security and world order\nThe U.S.–Russian reset agenda has been built around a series of tactical gambits intended to alter the tone of interaction\nand define practical measures to address discrete issues of mutual concern. The work program has been more or less\nindifferent to larger world order considerations (The White House, 2010). Nonetheless such issues, including the altered\nconfiguration of power in the post-Cold War international system, the impact of globalization, and the changing nature of\ninternational security, have become critical determinants of the U.S.–Russian relationship.\nRussian elites, and the Russian public at large, continue to resent what is often described as Western triumphalism over\nthe outcome of the Cold War. According to this narrative after 1991 a defeated and humiliated Russia was pushed to the\nmarginwhile the “sole remaining superpower”, intervening at will and indifferent to themost basic Russian national interests\nwent about the business of reshaping the world to its own advantage (Utkin, 2002). The sharply etched anti-Americanism\nthat has become a “mainstream of Russian politics and culture” is one consequence of such perceptions (Laqueur, 2010).\nAnother consequence is the commitment on the part of the Russian leadership to reestablish Russia’s centuries old great\npower tradition by asserting national prerogatives more forcefully. The goals are closely related: “when Putin says ‘national\nstrength’”, suggests Victor Loupan, “the Russians hear ‘national dignity’” (Loupan, 2000). As “a world power with regional\nambitions and interests” the Russian Federation has been particularly focused on issues in Europe and Eurasia, but it claims\nthe whole world as a stage. Putin’s credibility and remarkable durability as an elected leader derives in some measure from\nthe conviction that he has been successful in reasserting national pride and reestablishing Russia’s stature as a great power.\nWashington has been unwilling to countenance Russia’s ambitions, considered unrealistic and contrary to U.S. interests.\nAmerica’s preferred image of a transformed Russian Federation according to Russian analysts is that of a country which has\nbeen humbled by its defeat in the Cold War, subordinated to Western direction, and reduced to the second tier of world\npowers (Konyshev and Sergunin, 2011). The frictions that have plagued US-Russian relations since 1991 emerge in some\nmeasure from these contrasting images of status, capacity and resolve. Conflicting world views and perceptions of national\nvalues and interests give Russian–American competition a powerful emotional grounding, a problem that the reset agenda is\nnot designed to address and is not capable of addressing.\nRussian foreign policy discourse promotes the image of a multi-polar or polycentric world order, sometimes compared to\nthe Concert of Europe established at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, where a small group of self-selected great powers\ncooperate to shape global trends in their collective interest. Russia’s aspiration to assume its rightful place at the table of\nglobal governance is perceived to depend upon its ability to recreate its historical role as the political core of Eurasia, revitalize\nits economy through comprehensive modernization, and defend its interests abroad. Its leaders want Russia to remain as an\nindependent power center with a coherent national strategic outlook not subject to outside direction. These commitments\ngive Russian foreign and security policy a considerable breadth of scope and ambition. It also condemns the Federation to the\npursuit of goals that it lacks themeans to realize, and to chronic bouts of conflict with a U.S. that remains committed to sustain\nits own status as global leader, described unapologetically in the Statement of Principles of the Project for the New American\nCentury as “good for both America and for the world” (Project for the New American Century, June 3, 1997).\nEven in cases where Russian and American strategic priorities seem to be aligned, friction plagues the relationship and\nmakes effective cooperation difficult to achieve. The issue of Iran is a case in point. Counter-proliferation, considered as\namatter of mutual concernwhere Russian–American coordination is required to achieve results, should be a pillar of the reset\nagenda. Neither Washington nor Moscow has any desire to see the emergence of a nuclear Iran. But Russia has conflicting\ninterests at stake, many of which are related to its larger agenda for national revival, that complicate the picture. These include\neconomic advantage, pride and reputation, and the desire to thwart what are still understood as the U.S.’s hegemonic regional\naspirations. Conflicting motives lead to contradictory policies that give the Iranian leadership room for maneuver and\nfrustrateWestern intent (Vakil, 2006). In practice working with the Russians on an issue of shared concern comes to resemble\na cat and mouse game that generates little positive advantage but considerable distrust and ill-will.\nThe same kind of complicated dynamics apply to Russian policy toward Afghanistan, where a shared commitment to resist\na return to power by the Taliban is balanced by a desire for eventual U.S. disengagement, or toward the Arab Awakening,\n', 'R.C. Nation / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 45 (2012) 379–387 385where Russia should have no particular stake in the fate of various and sundry Arab dictators, but looks warily uponWestern\nintervention (Blank and Saivetz, 2011). The cases of Libya and Syria have provided the most recent examples of divergent\npriorities. In March 2011 Russia opted not to veto UN Security Council Resolution 1973 sanctioning a “no-fly zone” with the\npurported intent to prevent an assault by the forces of Muammar Qaddafi against the civilian population of Benghazi. The\ndecision was contested at the highest level when Prime Minister Putin went on record mocking intervention in Libya as akin\nto “medieval calls for crusades”, a position that was immediately refuted an “unacceptable” by President Medvedev (Putin\nCompares Libya Resolution to Crusade Call, 2011; Levy and Shanker, 2011). Soon however Moscow was expressing unqualified\nopposition to what had become a protracted, NATO-led military campaign bent upon bringing Qaddafi down. The\neventual fall of the dictator in September, and his subsequent capture and brutal murder, seemed to reinforce all its concerns\n– Russia was deprived of an attractive commercial partner and once again confronted with the spectacle of Western military\nintervention facilitating regime change with open ended consequences (Felgenhauer, 2011). In the case of Bashar al-Assad’s\nviolent repression of dissent in Syria, Moscow has consistently refused to cooperate with plans for external intervention,\na policy characterized as “despicable” by Secretary Clinton (Clinton Blasts Russia, China on Syria, 2012). Moscow’s motivations\nin the Syrian conflict are complex, but undoubtedly include a healthy dose of skepticism about U.S. motives and their\nimplications for Russia – skepticism that does not bode well for the future of U.S.–Russian relations (Luk’ianov, 2012).\nSo long as the Russian leadership clings to a paradigm for national revival that identifies malevolent intent on the part of\nthe U.S. and its allies as a primary challenge, and the U.S. leadership to a strategic vision that proclaims “the entire planet. as\na zone of US vital interests” and resists Russian efforts to reassert its traditional role as Ordnungsmacht in Eurasia, it will be\ndifficult for the reset agenda to progress beyond the modest tactical adjustments that have been achieved to date (Lukyanov,\n2009). Antagonistic strategic visions grounded in contrasting images of world order impose structural barriers to a more\nprofound U.S.–Russian détente.\n6. Conclusion\nThe concept that has inspired the Russian–American reset agenda remains valid. Through 2008 relations had deteriorated\nto a dangerous extent. The two countries are not at odds over matters of vital concern, and have many goals in common. The\ncommitment to establish more businesslike relations and expand cooperation in areas of mutual interest was an appropriate\ncorrective that has brought positive results. Russia is a difficult partner but there is no need to assume inevitable hostility.\n“Does it really serve the West’s long-term interests”, asks Daniel Treisman, “to assume some unproven imperial agenda, to\nexaggerate the authoritarian features of the current regime, to demonize those in the Kremlin and romanticize its liberal\nopponents, to identify progress toward democracy with revolution, to jump to the defense of Russia’s international adversaries\nbefore the facts are clear” (Treisman, 2011)?\nDespite its accomplishments the reset is far from secure. Since 1991 the Russian Federation and the U.S. have moved\nthrough a numbers of cycles where phases of rapprochement have given way to a deterioration of relations and intensified\nstrategic competition. The reset agenda has been “limited and inherently unstable”, and at present the momentum of\nprogress has stalled (Cohen, 2011). In critical areas such as democratization and respect for human rights, arms control,\ncounter proliferation, energy security, and regional stability, conflict has become more pronounced. The change in atmosphere\nand tactical adjustments uponwhich the agenda for resetting was constructed has not been sufficient to overcome the\nmore profound structural sources of U.S.–Russian rivalry (Mattox, 2011). This study identifies four such sources of discord:\ndivergent patterns of domestic governance including political and strategic culture, persistent strategic rivalry, differences\nover the premises of regional order in the new Eurasia, and contrasting visions of world order. If the reset agenda is to lead\nforward to a more substantial redefinition of the Russian–American relationship, and of Russia’s place in the 21st century\nglobal community, these underlying sources of enmity will need to be dismantled.\nThe best way forward would place responsibilities on both parties that neither seems prepared to accept. Russia’s fixation\non status and “greatness” does not correspond to its really existing potential. The country needs to prioritize domestic\nchallenges on the basis of a long term agenda for deep modernization. Modernizationwill go forward in some shape or form,\nbut under Putin Russia is unlikely to temper its international ambitions. Asked during an October 2011 interview inwhich he\nsought to justify the decision to seek a third presidential term, if he should be considered a “hawk”, the Russian Prime\nMinister replied, cleverly and revealingly, that “the hawk is a fine little bird” (iastreb-khoroshaia ptichka) (Putin podgotovil\ngrazhdan k smeni vlasti, 2011).\nThe U.S. and its Western allies would ideally move beyond the limited goals of the reset as originally defined towards\na strategy of more comprehensive engagement designed to institutionalize Russia’s status as a full fledged member of the\nWestern security community. It is not difficult to define a practical agenda for bringing Russia closer to the NATO alliance. A\nstudy prepared by the London-based International Institute for Security Studies and the Moscow-based Institute for\nContemporary Development recommends the development of a joint U.S.–Russian Strategic Concept to serve as the foundation\nfor a series of enhanced confidence building measures addressing areas of shared interest that would make Russia\na functioning associate of the Alliance without requiring the extension of an Article Five commitment or the surrender by\nMoscow of sovereignty over national security policy (Towards a NATO-Russian Strategic Concept, 2010). Medvedev’s proposal\nfor a new Eurasian security architecture could be taken up by the NATO-Russian Council, or “an enhanced NATO-Russian\nCouncil incorporating selective cooperative elements of the Russian proposed security organization” (Mattox, 2011). Best\nwould be the most unambiguous choice – a Membership Action Plan for Russia pointing toward full membership in the\n', 'R.C. Nation / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 45 (2012) 379–387386Alliance when the conditions for association have beenmet. Such initiatives would require the revaluation of powerful vested\ninterests, as well as a degree of coherence in Western attitudes and policy toward Russia that is not in place, and not likely to\nbe put in place. It would also require an acceptance of more tempered ambitions that Moscow does not seem prepared to\ncountenance. Bringing Russia into the Alliance would require a degree of strategic vision, political coherence, and willingness\nto accept risk, that is not likely to emerge from the divided polities on either side of the new East-West divide, preoccupied\nwith distinct, but in comparable ways nearly intractable domestic concerns.\nMuddling through with the limited initiatives of the reset agenda, in the hope that major dislocations will not once again\nthrow the Russian–American relationship off the rails, is probably the best that can be hoped for. The current phase of U.S.–\nRussian détente has not exhausted its potential, but determined, creative, and flexible diplomacy and statesmanship will be\nrequired if it is to be sustained.\nReferences\nA Conversation with Dmitry Medvedev, November 15, 2008.
