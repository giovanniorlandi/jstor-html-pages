We have al\nready lost something over a thous\nand dollars last year and before,\nthat we were entitled to, but our\nboard just let it slip by and didn’t\nget it; but now we can’t afford to\nmiss our part of this large appro\npriation, and w?e have got to get\nbusy or we will also lose if in the\n8ame way.\nHere we are, nineteen hundred\nYEARS AFTER THE MIRTH OK CHRIST,\nstruggling through 10 to 36 inches of\nmud, surrounded by the finest gravel\nbeds in the world, with only 10 or\n12 miles of decent roads in the\ncounty. Honestly are you not\nashamed of such conditions ? J\nam;and worst of all it costs us $3.00\na day to have a man ride over them\nat regular intervals each year, just\nto see if they are Itill mud, and of\ncourse they get the same result (and\nthe $3 00) every time, hut we get\nnothing whatever in return .% *\nNow these mud inspections could\nbe made just as easily if the official\nwould just stay on the public square\nat the county seat, and the other\ntowns, and just watch the teams\ncoming in from the different roads,\nwith <?nough ynud clinging to each\npair of mules and wagon to make\neasily from 10 to 15 good brick ;\nthis mudcould be examined by the\nofficial thoroughly, and, if neces\nsary, analyzed. Some say the roads\nare muddier than they were 50 years\nago, owing to the increased travel,\npossibly this analysis would tell.\nBut. think of it, if all the money\nand time spent in the last 50 years\ninspecting these mud roads had\nbeen epent in building permanent\nroads, your children would not have\nto be dragging through mud to\nschool today, neither would your\nteam have to strain every muscle\nin them to drag 500 feet of lumber\nto market; but yet, after paying\nall these years for inspecting these\nmud roads and creaking bridges, we\nhaven’t got anywhere yet, and all\nthis money and time has been ab\nsolutely wasted and vve yet stand\nright where we did fifty years ago, ■\nhandicapped by the mud roads,\nWhat are we going to stand for i\nthese conditions to continue during\nt Vtm n ■> v-v f ion A O T _ A.\nuuj V#* v»i<if,uivuuiCUl I liC l UP\nsay with one accord NO !

Was it the old time\nmoss.back methods? NO. It was\nthe very latest inventions and meth\nods, modem TO THE MINUTE,\nI that did the trick, How long would\nColumbus’ fleet of old time ves\nsels have lasted in this great con\nflict ? and WHY ? Ask the soldier\nboys back from ^Trance and Eng\nland about the good roads there.\nThey have seen the advantages of\ngood roads, and will not be con\ntented longer with mud roads ; the\ngood roads helped them win the\nwar, and they will help us win,\nright here in life’s battle for exist\nence. Good road construction adds\nto the permanent wealth of any\ncounty and every individual in it;\nevery county that has built perma\nnent roads is -more than pleased\nwith them and finds that it is one\nof the best possible paying invest\nments and would not begin to think\nof going back to the mud roads un\ntier any circumstances.\nIn midwinter ifow long docs it\ntake the doctor to Aach your family\nand loved ones when they get dan\ngerously sick, or happen to some\n! serious accident, where life depends\non the doctor reaching them on\ntime ?

He\nwould have been discharged and\nanother leader put in his place tlmt\nwould have led them out Oh! “if\nhe would only send us some lead\ners.” Now as none of our former\ncounty officials for all these years\nhave done anything to lead us out\nof these mud roads, let’s look\naround and put in some real lead\ners, that can and will go forward\nand get results, and help instead of\nhinder in this great work of building\nsome real roads. h\nThe other day I was talking to a\nfarmer that started over to his\nneighbor’s 7 miles distant where he\nwas offered corn at $1.30 per bush\nel, hut after he had pulled through\nthe mud 4 miles and his team about\nworried out, he asked about\nthe condition of the roads the\nreminder of the distance and learn\ning that they were almost impassable\nhe paid $1.50 per bushel rather than\ntry to go the other three miles, now\nsay for illustration the load was 20\nbushels he was out $4 .00 in good,\nmoney in a single day on account of j\nbad roads, or more than enough to I\npay a good supervisor to work a\nwhole day devising plans to get bet\nter roads, and say that during the\nsame day 20 farmers in the county\nwere hauling corn under the same\nconditions, they were out $80.00 in\nmoney absolutely lost, for which\nthey will never get any return, or\nenough to hire the best board of\nsupervisors that the people could\nelect, to work a whole extra day to\ndevise the best plans to build bet\nter roads, to say nothing of the!\namounts lost by the farmers in the\ncounty that were hauling ties, tirn-1\nher, lumber etc., the same day with j\ntheir wagons not over one third to j\nhalf loaded on account of the mud.\nThese are the conditions the peo\nple of Tishomingo county are facing\nevery day; and the time has now\nf illy arrived far a change; and just:\nat this time comes the offered as\nsistance of the Government; so let’s\nclear the deck for action, by getting\nall the drones and abstacles out of\nthe county offices so that we can\nproceed forward, without obstruc\ntions, and put in some real leaders,\nthat will pull us out of these mud\nroadB in the shdftest possible time.\n.— -----■— — -*\nfej=iL__zz:rzizzma:~ is.. —\nft I\n■j y\ni:r.OIvTt.RS.D IN BY Ett v PRICE ft CV\n^ There is symmetry of line, spirited youth\' m\nfulness and poise in the clever originality\nand perfect proportioning so manifest in\n•\nThat is why so many of\nour returning “Boys in the\nService" are having us tailor\ntheir hew clothes to indb ,\nvidual order.

Only one column ap\npears on the personal roll for it. At\nleast seventy per cent, of the tax\npayers have less than $250 worth of\nHOUSEHOLD FURNITURE, and\nare exempt from assessment for\nsame. Surely, none except hotels\nor rooming places have more than\n$250 invested in beds and bedding,\nand it would be unfair to other tax\npayers for such to escape their por\ntion of the tax burden, All HOUSE\nHOLD FURNITURE in excess of\n$250 has ALWAYS been subject to\ntaxation. There is no new burden\nimposed by the itemization ; it car\nries the law, which has been in effect\nsince the creation of the State.\nThere are many luxuries in the\nHouseholds of the Rich or Well-to\ndo, which have not .heretofore ap\npeared on the Tax List Blanks (al\nthough always taxable) ; such as\ncut elaes. art sciuares. mahotronv\nor other expensive and handsome\nfurniture. There are art squares in\nsome cities which cost more than\n$400 each. Unfortunately, Missis\nsippi has not many, Whose homes\nare adorned with such luxuries;\nhut the fortunate should be glad to\npay their portion to the State Gov\nernment, which educates the youth,\npensions the Confederate Soldier,\nheals the poor, when afflicted or\ncrippled, and cures or cares for the\ninsane; but she cannot do so with\nout money. The money cannot be\nraised except by taxation. Every\ncitizen honestly owes his portion of\nthe expense of the State Govern\nment. This portion is measu ^\nby the value of all taxable r\nowned by the citizen. _ It is W;\nerty is assessed and valued accord\ning to law.\nMuch machinery has been escap\ning taxation; this has been occas\noned by the omission of the names\nof the various kinds of it from the\ntax assessment blanks. Only one\ncolumn appears on the roll for this,\nbut the itemization will add much\nto the rolls.\nDiamonds, jewelry, cut glass, art\nsquares, rugs, automobiles, solvent\ncredits, merchandise and many\nkinds of property other than the\nabove are escaping their portion of\nthe tax burden either by not being\nlisted or by being undervalued. It\nis your duty to see that property of\nall kinds is assessed for its value ;\nand, if not reported or if underval\nued to report the tax-dodger to the\nSupervisors and District Attorney, j\nIt is your moral duty, too, to the j\nax-payers, who have rendered hon- i\n!8t returns because the burden that I\nihould be borne by the untaxed\niroperty will be home by other\niroperty, by "Old Beck,” by "Old\nduley,” by the farm land and by\nhe widow’s humble cottage because\nhese things cannot be hidden from\nhe Assessor’s eye.\nDo not listen to the wails of the I,\nax-dodger, who tries to bluff you i\n>ut of doing your sworn duty, by i\nhreatsto "tear down your political ■\nday house,” Fear not the politi- j\nian, who is trying to ride into of- t\nice, not on his merits, but by mak- (\nng foolish promises to abolish tax- >\nition; such promises, always, re- *\nult in an increase in taxation. *\nYours very truly,\nD.

The greatest campaign ex\nperts in the country are heading the\ndrives, and the whole immense con\nstituency of the denomination is\nworking as one man to see that the\ndrives are a success.\nMany individuals are planning to\ngive substantial sums to the mis\nsionary w’ork of their church and\nthroughout the length and breadth\nof Methodism every one is doing his\nbast. No subscriptions are being\ntaken at this time, it being a nec\ncessary rule of the general plan that\nall subscribtions -must be made\nwithin the limit of the eight-dry\ndrive.\nHowever, there is an exception to\nthe hardest cut rule always, and the\nCentenary treasurer found an ex\nception to the subscription rule.\nThis was the way of it:\nSeveral days ago the Centenary\ntreasurer received a letter—a letter\nwritten in a thin, delicate script,\nwith pale ink on thin lined paper.\nIt was from a dear old lady (she\nwas a dear old lady, for only that\nkind could have written such a let\nter) and the missive read:\n“Will you please accept this dol-,\nlai with my earnest wish for the\nsuccess of the financial campaign of\nthe church. The raising of the\n$35,000,000 by our Southern Church\nwill mean a great deal in making\nthe world a better place to live in\nboth here in America and into the\nfurthermost parts of tin earth\nand I feel privileged to give my\nmite to the cause. I wish it\ncould be more—but I am living in\nan Old Woman,’ Home, and even\nthis small sum means its little\nsacrifice. The fact is I am sending\nit now for fear I may be tempted to\nspend it if I leave it in its hiding\nplace in my little desk. I hope you\nwill keep it, therefore, though it\ndoes come ahead of time. And I\nsend it w:th the hope that every\nman and woman in Methodism will\ngive—in proportion as I have done\nbecause I know if they do it will all\nbe a great success. I want to add\nthat I hope t ie wealthy givers of the\nchurch will be as happy in the giv\ning of their thousands as I have\nbeei in sending in my mite.”\nSuch a spirit as that! It would\nmove mountains. It would do any\nthing. The dollar from the dear\nlittle old lady in an Old Woman’s\nHome went into the Centenary\ntreasury, where it will await the\ncoming of the millions more—and\nthe letter is being sent broadcast to\nmany thousand newspapers, where\nit is hoped the valiant spirit of one\nlittle woman will inspire a million\nMethodists to give as generously\nancLas gloriously.\nClooneys iPlace,”\n* ^ —\n" l *\'■ • > ijff •, •*•• ; ’ >\nWe\n• i\n■ ■*\nRepair\nAll\nKinds of\nMusical\nInstruments.', 'LOCAL AND PERSONAL\nRemember, that advertisements\nordered in this paper and no time\nlimit specified will be published\nand charged for until ordered\nout\nMr. G.
