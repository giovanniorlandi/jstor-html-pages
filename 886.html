        <pre>['WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 1\nMOBILITY, MIGRATION AND TRANSNATIONAL  \nCONNECTIVITY1 \nIntroduction\nIn an age of information overload and online connectivity, there is a sense that we are more closely linked globally \nthan ever before. Routine activities in everyday lives are testament to a modern-day transnationalism. For \nexample, e-mails written by people displaced by conflict can reach relatives in safer lands in real time, providing \nnews of escapes and reassurance. Hard-earned money transferred back to family thousands of kilometres away buys \nmuch-needed food and supports access to education for the next generation. These types of everyday activities \n– sending e-mails, wiring cash, video-conferencing on smartphones, and downloading apps – have become an \nintegral part of many people’s lives in recent years, dramatically increasing our access to information, places, \ncapital, goods, people and ideas. More is available at our fingertips than ever before. Yet the degree of access \nand interconnectedness between and within communities and people varies significantly.\nAt the same time, current public and political discourses abound with talk of an increase in anti-globalization \nsentiment, of communities and people feeling left behind and of some societies finding it increasingly difficult \nto reconcile global advancement, human development and public expectations. This has become particularly \npointed and highly relevant to emigration and immigration processes – how they are analysed, how they are \ndiscussed and debated, and how they are responded to – within a broader context of global trends that have \naltered fundamental aspects of daily life in many parts of the world. Alongside recent changes in the overall \ntone of the discussion on globalization, there exists a rich and diverse body of work on the topic, its meaning, \nits impacts, its benefits and its costs.2\nWhat is globalization?\nGlobalization is a set of processes resulting in the growing breadth, intensity, speed and impact of \nworldwide interconnectedness as a result of:\n• the stretching of social, political and economic activities across political frontiers, regions and continents;\n• the intensification or increased magnitude of flows of trade, investment, finance, migration, culture \nand so on;\n• the speeding up of global interactions and processes; and\n• the deepening impacts of global interactions, such that the effects of distant events can become \nhighly significant elsewhere, blurring the boundaries between domestic matters and global affairs.\nSource: Held et al., 1999.\n1 The authors of this chapter are Marie McAuliffe, Head, Migration Policy Research Division, IOM; Alexandra M. Goossens, Graduate \nInstitute of International and Development Studies, Geneva; and Anita Sengupta, Director, Asia in Global Affairs and Senior Fellow \nand Coordinator, Calcutta Research Group.\n2 Lechner and Boli, 2015; Steger, Battersby and Siracusa, 2014.\n6\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity2\nMigration processes are profoundly affected by globalization, which, after all, fundamentally involves \ninteractions that span multiple geographic places, transcending nation states. These interactions involve ideas, \ncapital, goods, services and information, as well as people who virtually and actually connect with others across \nboundaries. The links between international migration and complex processes of greater interconnectedness \nare of growing importance for several reasons. Firstly, a better understanding of the linkages provides some \ninsight into the broader global dynamics affecting populations likely to move, including those at risk of \ndisplacement and/or irregular migration. Secondly, it can help us appreciate the role and limits of policies \nin influencing and shaping migration trends and patterns. Thirdly, greater interconnectedness can present \nconsiderable challenges to better managing unsafe, irregular migration. Fourthly, the recent advances in \ntransportation and telecommunications technology have heralded massive change already, which appears to \nbe part of a longer-term trend that is unlikely to change course. Examinations of transnational connectivity, \nmobility and migration are relevant now and will remain so well into the future. \nIn this chapter, we examine one specific aspect of globalization: transnational connectivity, which we define \nas both physical and virtual connectivity between people. We focus specifically on changes to transportation \nand telecommunications technology over time, and on international migration rather than internal migration. \nThe second section provides a brief overview of the key advances in transportation and telecommunications \ntechnology globally. The third section discusses how transnational connectivity is affecting migration processes. \nThe fourth and final section briefly discusses the implications for migration governance. \nThe evolution of transportation and telecommunications \ntechnologies\nThe significant increase in international mobility has been spurred by increased transportation links and \nthe rapid growth in telecommunications technology. The transport revolution (from sail to steam and the \ndevelopment of railroad), starting in the nineteenth century, dramatically increased the intensity and \nvelocity of international flows of people3 and, in the latter half of that century, emigration became a mass \nphenomenon. \nBy the mid-1960s, rapid technological changes in aviation, such as the development of the jet engine, \nresulted in the boom of air transportation. These advances allowed aircrafts to reach far-off destinations and \nat much lower cost, thus leading to greater changes in cross-border movements of people and goods.4 With \nthe availability of air transport, long-distance and real-time telecommunications, globalization has allowed \ntransnational communities to flourish. The falling costs of ocean freight, transatlantic telephone calls, \nair transport and satellite charges have resulted in a “death of distance”.5 Recent data show a continuing \ndownward trend of travel costs (see figure 1) and an increase in international tourist arrivals (see figure \n2). While tourist arrivals are only one facet of international mobility, the data show that the volume of \nmovements around the world is increasing and shows no signs of abating.\n3 Lucassen, Lucassen and Manning, 2010.\n4 Hoovestal, 2013.\n5 Cairncross, 1997.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 3\nFigure 1.

International tourist arrivals (millions), 1995–2016\nSource:  UNTWO, 2017.\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity4\nImportantly, it does not follow that geography and space constraints have vanished. They remain of \nfundamental importance with regard to mobility, including the movements of people that are variously \ncircumscribed, such as the cross-border movements of people fleeing armed conflict, disasters or those embarking \non perilous sea journeys in search of better lives elsewhere. This is demonstrated, for example, by the number of \nforeign-born residents globally, which shows that people who move to another country are much more likely \nto remain within their immediate region than move further afield (as discussed in chapter 3 on the regional \ndimensions of migration). Furthermore, geographic proximity has long been acknowledged as a central factor \nunderpinning migration patterns and processes, as far back as Ravenstein’s “laws of migration”.6 Advances in \ntechnology, however, mean that more people than ever before can overcome the issue of distance. The volume \nof cross-border movements being managed by many countries around the world is continuing to increase. \nIn the United States, it is estimated that up to 390 million cross-border movements occurred in 2016,7 which \nwas up from 225 million in 1980.8 In Australia, 14.5 million cross-border movements were recorded in 1996–97, \ncompared to 31.6 million in 2011–12.9 The current estimate is that, by 2020, Australia will experience 50 million \nmovements per year across its borders.10 In Japan, estimates of selected cross-border movements11 indicate an \nincrease from 7.2 million in 1985 to about 36 million in 2015.12\nIn recent decades, advances in telecommunication technologies have also been pronounced, particularly \nin the last decade (see text box on key telecommunications advances), although not uniformly. Access to \nmobile telephones appears to have increased dramatically, as can be seen in figure 3. Global Internet usage \nhas also grown rapidly, although it is unevenly distributed. There is a digital gender gap with higher Internet \naccess rates for men than for women in all regions of the world; globally, men’s access rate is 51 per cent and \nwomen’s is 44.9 per cent.13 Indeed, increased user rates alone do not necessarily reflect an even take-up of \nnew technologies. Differential access by class, gender and ethnicity are factors in technological engagement.14 \nFurthermore, there is a digital divide between developed and developing countries, with 81 per cent of \nindividuals using the Internet in developed countries, compared to 40 per cent in developing countries and \nonly 15.6 per cent in the least developed countries.15 The number of mobile broadband subscriptions in \ndeveloping countries, however, is growing at a fast rate. In Myanmar, for instance, there was a dramatic increase \nof 4 million new mobile phone subscribers in the third quarter of 2016, following a recent liberalization of the \nnational telecommunications network.16\n6 Ravenstein, 1885.\n7 US Customs and Border Protection, 2017.\n8 White House, 1998.\n9 ABS, 2007; Australian DIBP, 2012.\n10 Australian DIBP, 2012.\n11 In the context of Japan, selected cross-border movements include the number of foreign nationals entering Japan and the number \nof Japanese departing Japan. These figures have been summed up to provide global estimates of selected cross-border movements. \n12 Statistics Bureau, 2016.\n13 ITU, 2016.\n14 Panagakos and Horst, 2006.\n15 ITU, 2016.\n16 Ericsson, 2016.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 5\nKey telecommunications advances\n1876   Telephone\n1890s  First radio wave experiments\n1920s  First television transmissions\n1930s  Invention of the modern computer\n1960s  E-mail entering use\n1980s  Cellphone and GPS available for public use\n1993   Internet is shared in the public domain\n1994   Start of blogs and social networks\n2001   Start of 3G smart phones\n2004   Facebook is launched\n2006   Twitter is launched\n2007   Cloud computing – first iPhone is launched\n2010   First iPad and rapid growth of tablet usage\n2017   197 billion mobile applications (Apps) downloads worldwide, estimated to grow to 352.9 billion  \n in 2021.

A similar version of this graph was published by the Brookings \nInstitution on 25 February 2014 (see: www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/snapshot-6rorschach-tests-international-order).\nNote:  By 2016, the mobile phone subscription penetration rate was over 100%, which means there are \nnow more subscriptions globally than people (Ericsson, 2016).\nMobile apps, social networks and \nmobile operating systems that did not \nexist in 2006 include: \nWhatsApp, Uber, Airbnb, Android, \nInstagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, WeChat \nand Facebook Messenger\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity6\nGlobally, it appears that the number of smartphone17 subscriptions has now surpassed those for basic mobile \nphones, accounting for 55 per cent of all mobile subscriptions.18 With the increase in smartphones and broadband \nconnectivity, access to social media is growing – to the point that smartphones are now often the platform for \npeople’s first experience with the Internet. It is important, however, not to overestimate the impact of newer \ncommunications technologies. Although the Internet is considered a global communications medium, access is \nstill limited in many locations. Accurately measuring the Internet’s level of influence is difficult.19 While there \nare considerable cross-country and cross-regional variations, we can also see that, in recent years, even the least \ndeveloped countries have experienced great leaps in connectivity. In Afghanistan, for instance, according to \nestimates, mobile telephone subscriptions increased from 1.2 million people (4.8%) in 2005 to almost 20 million \npeople (61.6%) in 2015.20 \nSome communities and people face the anomaly of virtual connectivity and physical immobility. Brownkey \nAbdullahi, a blogger and activist in the Dadaab refugee camp, shared her perspective on the limits of globalization \n(see text box below). While Brownkey Abdullahi is virtually connected globally, she remains physically isolated. \nThe world is not as globalized as you think\nAs someone who was born and raised in the world’s oldest and largest refugee camp, I’m here to tell you \nthe world isn’t as globalized as you think.\nOpened in 1992 and originally intended to provide temporary sanctuary for 90,000 people, Dadaab is \nthe world’s largest and oldest refugee camp. Today, almost half a million people call it home. Like many \npeople in the camp, I was born here, and it is the only place I have ever known. I have never left Kenya, \nthe country where I was born, raised and educated, but have no right to citizenship.\nThanks to radio stations and spotty internet access, we can still connect with the world we are not able \nto experience first-hand. We stay in the loop with global developments, and thanks to social media I can \nnow meet (if only virtually) people from other countries through a temperamental internet connection \non my mobile phone.\nThese are but small tastes of the benefits of globalization that many people take for granted, but they \nhave made an enormous difference. For several years now I have been campaigning in my camp against \ngender-based violence and female genital mutilation. What little internet access we have has allowed me \nto share that message with a larger international audience through my blog.\nSource:  Abridged excerpt of an article by Brownkey Abdullahi published by the World Economic Forum on 6 July 2016  \n(Abdullahi, 2016).\n17 Smartphones, using third-generation (3G) technology (and beyond), are mobile phones that have an integrated computer, an \noperating system, Internet access and the ability to run “Apps”. Basic mobile phones, using second-generation (2G) technology, did \nnot have Internet access. \n18 Ericsson, 2016.\n19 Rabogoshvili, 2012.\n20 ITU/World Bank, 2017.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 7\nTransnational connectivity and migration actors\nEven though innovations in transport and telecommunications technology have increased interconnectivity and \nfacilitated movement, they have not always resulted in more migration, although they may alter the underlying \nmigration processes. This section explores how increased interconnectivity is affecting migration processes and \ndifferent migration actors.\nCurrent estimates of international migrants over time show that migration is increasing, although the proportion \nremains small, rising from 2.2 per cent in 1970 to 3.3 per cent in 2015, within the context of a substantial \nincrease in the world’s population. According to UN DESA estimates, in 2015, 244 million people were living in a \ncountry other than their country of birth – almost 100 million more than in 1990 (153 million), and over three \ntimes the estimated number in 1970 (84 million). Migration patterns have not been uniform, however, with two \nthirds of all international migrants currently residing in high-income countries.21 \nAn examination of some major works on migration (such as The Age of Migration;22 Global Migration Governance;23 \nGlobal Migration: Old Assumptions, New Dynamics;24 and The Routledge International Handbook of Migration \nStudies25) shows that, while they all acknowledge the increase in transnational connectivity, there is not much \ndiscussion on the role played by connectivity’s most rapidly changing aspect: telecommunications. In this \nsection, therefore, we examine how transnational connectivity is shaping migration processes. In doing so, we \nfocus on three main sets of migration actors – migrants, non-State actors and States – with particular reference \nto geography (origin, transit journeys and destination). Our discussion provides examples of how transnational \nconnectivity can affect these different migration actors.\nTransnational connectivity and migrants\nIn countries of origin, migrants and their communities are experiencing increasing connectivity in a multitude \nof ways, including in the form of social contact, remittance flows and the migrants’ return to their country \nof origin, such as for significant holidays and events. The impacts can be many and varied, depending on the \ncircumstances of the origin country (economic, social and political) as well as the situations of the migrants \nthemselves. Recent research, for example, focusing on the economic determinants and impacts of migration \nidentified a “positive effect of broadband on migration flows between 1995 and 2009 […] by improving the flow \nof information about the host, which affects migration decisions from the origin”.26 This needs to be viewed \nin a broader (structural) context, however, as increased information through greater connectivity may not \nnecessarily result in decisions to migrate and, therefore, higher levels of migration.  \n21 UN DESA, 2015.\n22 Castles, de Haas and Miller, 2014.\n23 Betts, 2011.\n24 Acosta Arcarazo and Wiesbrock, 2015.\n25 Gold and Nawyn, 2013.\n26 Unver, 2015. The study was based on flows to OECD countries: “The main host countries here are Austria, Belgium, the Czech \nRepublic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the \nUK. The selection of both OECD and non-OECD origin countries [is] based on the magnitude of the flows, examining those with a \nminimum number of 100 people” (Unver, 2015).\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity8\nThere is a substantial body of research and analysis on the determinants of migration that has identified \nmultiple factors underpinning migration patterns and processes, including those related to economics \nand trade, social and cultural links, demography and demographic change, safety and protection, as \nwell as geography and proximity.27 One line of research on the links between “maturity” of migration \nand human development, for example, shows that, at a certain point, higher incomes enabling increased \nemigration can then become a stabilizing influence and reduce outward migration. In other words, as \nGDP per capita increases, emigration initially increases and then decreases. This phenomenon, depicted \nin figure 4,28 has been referred to by some authors as the “mobility transition” or the “migration hump”.29 \nThe complex processes of migration and development need to be viewed in the context of broader globalization \ndynamics, as highlighted by Held et al.,30 including the acceleration of transitions enabled by much greater \nconnectivity.\nFigure 4.  Mobility transition\nSource:  Adapted from Clemens, 2014:7–8.\nNote:  Clemens found that overall higher economic development (higher incomes) is associated with \nreduced emigration. Refer to Clemens (2014) for further discussion of data analysis.\n27 See, for example, writings on cumulative causation (Massey, 1990), neoclassical economics (Todaro, 1989), world system theory \n(Portes and Walton, 1981), social capital theory (Massey, 1987), new economics of labour migration (Stark and Bloom, 1985), and \nsocial network theory (Boyd, 1989).\n28 Clemens, 2014.\n29 Zelinsky, 1971; Clemens, 2014.\n30 Held et al., 1999.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 9\nIncreased telecommunications between migrants and their families and communities – depending \non the migration and development interactions within the origin country – can affect (but may not \nnecessarily increase) the migration of family members left behind. Greater social and financial contact \ncan have a stabilizing effect on many families and communities that otherwise might be under pressure \nto also migrate. In Sri Lanka, for example, remittance inflows have steadily increased over the last 30 \nyears, rising from 1.9 per cent of GDP (USD 60 million) in 1979 to 8.7 per cent in 2015 (USD 7 billion).31 \nThey play a significant and stabilizing role in helping households meet their basic needs and increase their \nability to cope with adverse shocks (such as in the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami), but they also \nenable them to purchase land, releasing households from indebtedness, promoting small-scale enterprise \ndevelopment, and increasing investment in education and health.32 \nThe enhanced and extended connectivity for the transfer of capital, similar to the flow of information, can \nsupport or stabilize populations. Importantly, some people in origin countries have been more vulnerable \nto exploitative money transfer practices, due to their geographic isolation from formal and reliable banking \nsystems. Mobile money technology, however, has seen the geographic barriers to better money transfer \nservices dissipate and the costs of remitting decrease.33\nMobile money has become a significant phenomenon in recent years, largely due to “the convergence of \nadvanced mobile communication technologies and the ability to use it for data services in mobile money \ntransfer”.34 In their recent review of mobile money and technology trends, MIT researchers Shrier, Canale and \nPentland drew on a range of data to find that:\nOf the 2.5 billion people as of 2012 that did not have a financial account, 1.7 billion had a mobile \nphone. As of 2012 there were more mobile money accounts than traditional bank accounts in \nKenya, Madagascar, Tanzania and Uganda.35\nTelecommunications technology has also proved to be an important factor enabling migrants to access \ninformation in real time while in transit countries.36 The large-scale movement of people to Europe from \nTurkey in 2015, for example, highlighted in a very visible manner the application of smartphone technology \nin the migration of refugees and other migrants and the operations of smugglers37 (see the text box on \nthe “appification” of migration). Real-time connectivity enables information to be sourced and verified, \nparticularly where migrants are likely to undertake unsafe journeys or rely on smugglers.38\n31 World Bank, 2017.\n32 Sri Lanka Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, 2013.\n33 Shrier, Canale and Pentland, 2016.\n34 Tobbin and Kuwornu, 2011.\n35 Shrier, Canale and Pentland, 2016.\n36 Kuschminder and Koser, 2017; McAuliffe, 2013.\n37 McAuliffe and Koser, 2015; Zijlstra and van Liempt, 2017.\n38 Triandafyllidou and Maroukis, 2012.\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity10\nThe “appification” of migration: lessons from the 2015 Mediterranean maritime \nmigration flows\nThe world has changed fundamentally in the almost 70 years since the largest refugee crisis in Europe following \nthe aftermath of World War II when the Refugees Convention was being developed and refugee movements \nbeyond war-torn Europe were regulated by states (including under the United Nations). The UN coordinated \nrepatriation, returns and resettlement of refugees to third countries. In today’s terms, movements were \nslow, highly regulated and very selective. Information for refugees was largely the monopoly of states and \nopportunities for migrating to other regions were limited to formal channels. Things are very different now.\nSome 70 years on conflict and persecution may still be occurring at frustrating and tragic levels but \nthe context has changed. The ‘appification’ of migration has taken off, making migration processes \nfundamentally different in specific but important ways. Firstly, mobile phone technology has become the \nnorm, linking migrants to family, friends, humanitarian organisations and smugglers, but equally linking \nsmugglers to agents, corrupt officials, and their networks of fellow smugglers in dispersed locations.a The \ntelecommunications revolution is enabling the creation of unregulated migration pathways that are fast \nand affordable for an increasing number of people. There are many apps available for people travelling \nto and through Europe. For example, InfoAid has been set up by a Hungarian couple to provide real-time \nadvice on how to cross borders. Other apps help refugees integrate, such as Refugermany and Arriving in \nBerlin. Connectivity is supporting movements to safer regions for many but pathways are often extremely \ndangerous and at times deadly. \nSecondly, and for the first time in decades, large numbers of refugees and other migrants in transit and \nhost countries such as Turkey are not sitting and waiting for resettlement or return. They are taking \nmatters into their own hands, principally because they can. Information, advice and money can be shared \nquickly, and the constraints of geography more easily overcome. The massive and sudden growth in \nmovements through the Eastern Mediterranean route to Greece in 2015 was aided by strong connectivity.\nTelecommunications helped shape the size, composition, speed and geography of the European flows. \nReal-time coverage of movements and operations enable migrants – refugees, asylum-seekers and others –  \nto access useful information on where, when and how to travel. The strong preference for Germany \nover other European countries is not by chance. It has been realised by migrants themselves as sharing \nof information increases. In the context of limited access to visas, unregulated asylum pathways risk \nbecoming a funnel for refugees and non-refugees alike.b\na   Khalaf, 2016.\nb   McAuliffe and Koser, 2015.\nSource:  Abridged excerpt of an article that first appeared in ANU’s Policy Forum in January 2016 (McAuliffe, 2016).\nIn destination countries, the use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) enables more \nand more migrants to “maintain remote relations typical of relations of proximity and to activate them on \na daily basis”.39 By compressing time and distance, telephone calls, voice and video chats, social media and \n39 Diminescu, 2008.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 11\ne-mails enable migrants to stay connected with families and relatives, and to know what happens to them \nwherever they are, across national boundaries. For example, a recent study explored how young Koreans \nfrom transnational families in Canada choose and use different mobile platforms in different contexts.40 The \nstudy found that they use global platforms (especially Facebook) to widen their peer networks in Canada, \nwhile using the Korean-based mobile platform of Kakao Talk to maintain their ties with the Republic of Korea \nand/or ethnic communities in Canada. Social connectivity is also important for displaced persons, including \nrefugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is currently undertaking a project to \nimprove refugee well-being through enhanced Internet and mobile connectivity (see text box below).\nConnectivity for refugees \nUNHCR carried out a global assessment of refugees’ access to, and use of, the internet and mobile phones \nwhere available, to help inform the development of a new UNHCR Global Strategy for Connectivity for Refugees.\nOne of the key findings of the research is that while 7 per cent of refugee communities lack the \nrequisite digital infrastructure for internet access and mobile communications, most refugees in urban \nareas live in place that have 2G or 3G mobile coverage. For those in rural areas, however, the situation \nis far worse, with 20 per cent living in areas with no connectivity.\nSource:  Abridged excerpt from UNHCR, 2017, accessed on 5 April 2017.\nWhile connectivity may benefit migrants by enabling them to stay connected with families and relatives, \ngreater transnational connectivity – via mobile phones, especially – has also been found to amplify the \npressure and demands on migrants in destination countries to send money home.41 These findings support \n40 Yoon, 2016.\n41 Hunter, 2015.\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity12\nlong-standing evidence suggesting that migrants can face considerable pressure to remit.42 In his study, \nHunter found that pressures to remit were amplified by the use of mobile telephony.43\nTransnational connectivity and non-State actors\nJust as we have seen significant changes in the day-to-day lives of migrants and their communities brought about \nby advances in technology and greater interconnectedness, non-State actors involved in supporting, facilitating \nor reporting on migration and mobility have been profoundly affected in a variety of ways. Broadly defined, \nnon-State actors are groups, organizations or individuals that are not part of State structures yet may exert \ninfluence on national and international processes and systems. Examples of non-State actors include: migration \nagents; migrant smugglers and human traffickers; employers; civil society, non-governmental organizations \n(NGOs) and philanthropists; and international organizations.44 Non-State actors are increasingly operating \ntransnationally and their businesses and activities are much less confined by geography than ever before. As \ngeography becomes less of an issue, migration processes are inevitably affected. This section provides examples \nof specific non-State actors and how they engage in migration processes.\nMigrant smuggling and human trafficking networks are using ICT (especially smartphone technology) to \norganize international travel, connect with clients and (in some cases) extract ransoms from family back home.45 \nSmugglers also use social media to connect with new clients and advertise their services. Facebook and other \nsocial media platforms provide information on smuggling services, including to certain destinations, which is \nchanging the way in which irregular migration is occurring and smugglers operating.46 Increased connectivity \nenables people to check smugglers, as it also extends the ability of migrants to transmit information to make \nothers aware of smugglers to avoid.47 \nThe use of ICT has also become a dominant force in the emergence of the “mobility industry”, which is operating \nin response to increasing demands by the relatively wealthy wanting to temporarily or permanently migrate to \nlower-cost countries with good health care and other services.48 The innovative use of blogging, social media \nplatforms and other interactive online practices have tapped into and expanded a growing market – for example, \nfor US citizens seeking to move to Mexico; in 2015  there were estimated to be around 1 million US citizens \nresiding in Mexico.49 Similar mobility and migration facilitators abound in various locations, including South-East \nAsia, Southern and Eastern Europe, and North Africa, typically offering a range of relocation services that include \nmigration but extend well beyond this aspect into housing, study/education, health-care services and employment. \nIn terms of the migration industry, migration-related agents and brokers have proliferated as opportunities \nfor transnational labour recruitment have expanded. Even at a most basic administrative level, Internet-based \nvisa application processes, for example, have become much more common over time, allowing for reduced \nvisa counter services at embassies, and an expansion in Internet-based brokers and agents who can facilitate \n42 Carling, 2008; Vargas-Silva, 2016.\n43 Hunter, 2015.\n44 For the purposes of this chapter, migrants (who are technically non-State actors) are discussed in the previous section.\n45 McAuliffe and Laczko, 2016.\n46 Brunwasser, 2015.\n47 Triandafyllidou and Maroukis, 2012.\n48 Bantman-Masum, 2015.\n49 UN DESA, 2015; US Department of State, 2017.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 13\nmigration through virtual means. Figure 5 shows the various layers involved in transnational recruitment \npractices, which are widely acknowledged as having increased in scale, complexity and speed, raising a raft of \nchallenges for regulators.50\nFigure 5.

In some cases, however, digital technology advances enhance transparency and support better \nrecruitment practices. The Filipino-based LBS Recruitment Solutions Corporation, for instance, is using online \nmedia and emerging social media applications to deal directly with employers and workers. The changes have \nhad a positive impact and, in 2014, results showed that the company’s supply chain of applicants had improved, \nadvertising costs had decreased, and no recruitment violations or money claim cases had been reported.51 \nOther non-State actors are responding to migration in innovative ways through the use of technology. IOM, \nfor instance, is developing a mobile phone application (MigApp) that aims to provide migrants with access to \nreliable and practical information on the migration process and on available services in destination countries – \nproviding, for instance, updated information regarding visa and travel regulations, as well as a platform for \ninteraction with legitimate service providers.52 \n50 Pittman, 2013.\n51 IOM, 2014.\n52 IOM, 2017a.\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity14\nOther recent initiatives have involved the emergence of philanthropists, NGOs and other individuals supporting \nmigrants undertaking unsafe, irregular maritime journeys by providing humanitarian assistance en route. The \nuse of drone technology to detect migrant vessels in distress and target humanitarian relief is an example of \nthe application of newly accessible technology that was barely conceivable a decade ago.53 The Migrant Offshore \nAid Station, for example, is a registered foundation based in Malta that aims to save lives by assisting migrants \nwho find themselves in distress on unsafe vessels. In 2016, it launched a mission involving two drones to patrol \nMediterranean waters using day- and night-sensitive optics to send back high-resolution images. \nReal-time connectivity is also being used in conflict and displacement situations where mass movements are \ntaking place and tracking becomes important for a range of reasons, including population assessments to guide \nhumanitarian service delivery, as discussed in the text box below. Biometrics technology is considered by several \naid agencies to be highly efficient. UNHCR, for example, is using biometrics to register people in refugee camps \nand to monitor food and aid distribution to refugees to ensure that the amounts provided match the number of \nrefugees. However, this needs to be balanced with concerns about the monitoring and surveillance of people and \nthe authorities’ usage of data against migrants. Technologies, such as biometrics, iris scans or fingerprints, used \nby States to monitor human mobility, are political tools that can violate privacy.54\nBiometrics in developing countries \nIf you follow the news of large-scale biometrics programmes, one fact becomes immediately obvious.  \nA surprisingly large percentage of these initiatives are in developing nations. At least, it’s a surprise until \nyou start looking more closely at the context in which these programmes are being implemented. In \nmany cases, the situation is ripe for such solutions because of both need and opportunity. \n“Food and non-food aid provision, and food distribution, was one of the original use cases,” says [Justin] \nHughes, a procurement and supply chain expert for PA Consulting Group who has led the company’s work \nwith the United Nations…. “It’s also a population fixing tool for when you’ve got mass migration, when \nyou’ve got refugees streaming across a border. It provides the ability to create a database that doesn’t \nnecessarily identify an individual...” \nIt isn’t just a case of biometric systems being more efficient than paper-based ones – sometimes there’s \nlittle alternative. “When people flee a disaster zone or a conflict zone, they don’t take papers with them, \nand they don’t have the opportunity to bring any other form of documentation with them,” says Hughes. \n“Or they may have discarded their papers intentionally, if they felt that carrying a passport identifying \nthem as part of a particular group may have increased a risk. So for a number of different reasons, people \nwill often not appear with what we would recognise as a traditional paper-based or card-based form of \nidentification. With biometrics, you’re carrying your identity card with you on your fingers or on your irises, \nso that’s been the main advantage, and the fact that there is this level of technological rigour around it.”\nSource:  Abridged excerpt of Mansfield-Devine (2015), Biometrics in developing countries, Biometric Technology Today.\n53 Bryant, 2015.\n54 Dijstelbloem, 2017.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 15\nState actors and broader implications for managing migration\nWhile the growing convergence between the processes of globalization, social transformation and migration \nhas been recognized,55 it is difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment of the various ways in which \nStates’ migration policies and regulatory processes have been affected by the increase in transnational \nconnectivity. The impact of increased connectivity on States is likely to be uneven, fragmented, diverse and \ndependent on a country’s global migration status as country of origin, transit and/or destination. \nThis section provides examples of how States have (re)acted in relation to changes in migration processes \nunderpinned by transnational connectivity. As access to international movement has increased, States have \nsought to implement a range of strategies to manage this increase in scale, pace and diversity, and some \nStates have sought to maximize the benefits of migration. Immigration and border management policies \nand practices have evolved rapidly to account for perceptions of risk associated with the movement of \nlarge numbers of people, such as those associated with migrant smuggling, human trafficking and irregular \nmigration flows. Furthermore, as greater interconnectedness affects various aspects of migration, States have \nused technology to manage or facilitate migration more efficiently. Technological advances therefore affect \nthe management of migrant populations in various ways. \nICT potentially provides powerful tools for enhancing the quality of life of people, especially those living in \nremote locations. An emerging practice between States and the private sector involves using the potential ICT \nand transnational connectivity offer to lessen migration pressure in rural or remote areas, such as outlined \nin the text box on the Digital Island project in Cox’s Bazar.\nEmerging practice: public–private partnerships to improve connectivity in rural/\nremote areas to lessen migration pressure – Moheshkhali GiGA Digital Island project \nin Cox’s Bazar \nIn February 2016, Korea Telecom Corporation, one of the largest telecommunication service \nproviders in the Republic of Korea, signed a tripartite memorandum of understanding with the \nGovernment of Bangladesh and IOM for a pilot project to enhance government services in hard-toreach\nareas through better online connectivity. Reflecting a renewed emphasis on private–public \npartnerships and the importance of technology in development, the parties have come together \nto pilot a service provision model utilizing a high-speed Internet connection on Moheshkhali Island \n– a remote part of Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar region,  one of the poorest areas in the country, with \nlimited and low-quality access to services. The initiative is aligned with the Digital Bangladesh \nnational development strategy (which is part of the government’s “Vision 2021” initiative).\n55 Castles, de Haas and Miller, 2014.\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity16\n(…) In practice, the project will deliver social services, such as education and health care, relying on \ne-tools, such as online content and remote teaching, m-Health tools for diagnostics and e-consultations \nwith specialists. Rural Bangladeshis may, as a result, feel less of a need to travel several hours to \nvisit a doctor, and children may receive school lessons at home or at community centers. In addition, \nthrough facilitating market access through e-commerce platforms, rural Bangladeshis may also feel \nmore confident about their sources of income and feel less pressure to migrate for better earnings.\nSource:  Abridged excerpt of IOM, ILO and UNDP, 2016.\nFor countries of origin, another way of supporting migrant populations lies in regulating overseas employment \nrecruitment processes. In the Philippines, for instance, within the Department of Labor and Employment, the \nPhilippine Overseas Employment Administration provides in real time, through their website, an updated \nlist of overseas job openings as well as brokers’ contact information, and the number of vacancies available. \nFurthermore, there is a mandatory deployment process, which includes pre-departure orientation seminars \nand the issuance of an Overseas Filipino Worker identification card. This process aims to provide Filipino \nmigrant workers with information regarding their destination country and resources available to them at \nembassies or consulates, as well as financial management information (about remittances and the use of banks \nand ATM cards). Similarly, in order to tackle some of the challenges posed by private recruitment practices \nand to create a smoother and more transparent migration process, the Government of Nepal inaugurated in \n2014 a “labour village” in Kathmandu – a complex that houses under one roof all the foreign-employmentrelated\nservices, including country-specific offices that advertise jobs, NGOs and social welfare organizations, \ngovernment agencies (such as the Foreign Employment Promotion Board), recruiting agencies, pre-departure \norientation and skills training providers, a health centre and a guest house.56 The Government is providing \nmigrants with online services for banking and insurance and is looking into developing innovative services, \nincluding mobile and digital technology, so that households receive remittances faster, more cheaply and \ncloser to their residence.57\nStates also make use of increased connectivity and technological advances to manage migrant populations \nthrough enhanced border management. Increasingly sophisticated technology relying on real-time \nconnectivity is being applied to border management to support the emergence of “virtual borders” by \ndestination countries. Australia, for example, has progressively enhanced its virtual border since the \nintroduction of the universal visa regime in 1975.58  With the aid of real-time transnational connectivity, \nvisa integrity, security and other checks of passengers travelling by air to Australia occur well before people \nboard planes in origin countries. This multi-layered, geographically dispersed border processing model \nrequires considerable technology involving multiple IT systems with increasing capacity to detect identity \nand other fraud.59 \n56 Nepal Ministry of Labour and Employment, 2014.\n57 Nepal Ministry of Labour and Employment, 2015.\n58 ANAO, 2006.\n59 Ibid.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 17\nSimilar advances have been made in other parts of the world, with border processing systems, such as \ndetection of false documents via X-ray and fingerprint scanning, e-passport scanning, automated e-gates \nand biometric visas, becoming increasingly sophisticated, particularly since 11 September 2001.60 For \nexample, in 2013, the European Union launched the Smart Border initiative, which aims at expanding and \nharmonizing automated border-crossing via the use of e-gates and real-time entry and exit informationsharing\nacross the region. The information will be linked to fingerprint records and watch lists held by \npolice and made available to border control and immigration authorities. Technology has also supported \ncooperation with airlines, such as through the development of agreements about the physical return of \npeople refused entry at borders upon arrival, a key component of which is financial penalties imposed on \nairlines that incorrectly board passengers without conducting agreed checks.61 The extension of borders \nwell beyond the physical border through the increasing use of technology to facilitate real-time checking \nhas caused some commentators to raise concerns about the “relocation” of sovereignty through the \nextraterritorial application of norms62 and about the human rights impact of the indiscriminate sharing of \npersonal data.63\nImportant developments in managing and supporting migrant populations have emerged to enhance \nintegration processes. Some State authorities have been using telecommunications technologies to better \npromote the integration of migrants in their communities. In the Netherlands and Sweden, for example, ICT \nwith visual and audio learning methods are being used. Migrants have been able to develop their language \nproficiency faster, with ICT applications being used in the classroom to address the specific needs of each \nperson and, outside of the classroom, providing opportunities for independent learning.64 Germany recently \nlaunched a smartphone app called “Ankommen” [Arrive] to help migrants and asylum seekers integrate \nby offering a basic German language course, information on the asylum application process and on how \nto find jobs or training, as well as information on German values and social customs. The app – available \nin several languages – was jointly developed by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, the Federal \nEmployment Agency, the Goethe Institute, and Bayerischer Rundfunk (a public radio and TV broadcaster). \nFurthermore, thanks to the technological advances of the digital age, local governments can avail of a new \narray of tools for better understanding the needs of – and engaging with – the populations they serve. Web \nportals or mobile applications in different languages are to improve access to public services.65 For instance, \nNew York City has developed an interactive online self-service called NYC311 that is available in 50 languages. \nThis web platform enables all residents to submit service requests, file formal complaints and access public \ninformation anonymously and confidentially.  \nGreater transnational connectivity also provides States with tools for providing consular services and \nassistance to migrants. For the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala, for example, IOM Guatemala \ndeveloped a mobile application to provide such services. Among its various features, the mobile app enables \ndirect contact between migrants and Guatemalan consular agents, while also providing real-time data \nregistration and reporting. Migrants will be able to use this tool to contact national authorities when natural \n60 Jeandesboz, 2008.\n61 Taylor, 2008.\n62 Gammeltoft-Hansen, 2008; Godenau and Lopez-Sala, 2016.\n63 Valkenburg and van der Ploeg, 2015.\n64 Driessen et al., 2011.\n65 Mattoo et al., 2015.\n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity18\nhazards, such as earthquakes or hurricanes, strike. Additionally, it seeks to enhance visibility of diaspora \ncommunities by establishing a digital mechanism for posting content and promote special activities.66 \nWhile it is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide a comprehensive account of the multiplicity of \nState impacts and responses to migration and mobility stemming from and utilizing greater transnational \nconnectivity, it has highlighted the diversity of those impacts and approaches, as well as the many ways \ntechnology is utilized in migration processes. In the context of empirical research showing how the \nglobalization of migration has been skewed towards major destination countries,67 the emerging paradox \nbetween the extent of State control and populist expectations takes on heightened importance. Over time, there \nhas been a significant increase in State regulation in a variety of areas of economic and social life, resulting \nin higher expectations of State control. A historical perspective on the emerging regulation-expectation \nparadox is provided in the text box below.\nThe regulation-expectation paradox \nAs the capacity of modern nation States has grown—economically, socially and technologically— \nso too has the ability of States to regulate societies. Governance has increased while becoming \nincreasingly sophisticated and complex. Areas that had long been regulated by nation States (and \nkingdoms, empires, tribes, etc., before them), such as taxation of citizens and residents, along with the \nregulation of aspects of business and social protection, expanded to cover areas previously unregulated, \nsuch as telecommunications, media and broadcasting, environmental protection/conservation,  \npublic health, among many others. As part of this expansion of regulation and increasingly sophisticated \ngovernance, international migration—immigration and (in some countries) emigration—has become \nincreasingly regulated, with regulation involving the formulation of new legal-policy frameworks \nas well as the growing complexity of those frameworks. In Australia, for example, the original  \nMigration Act 1958 was 35 pages long and provided significant discretion to delegated decision \nmakers. By 2005, the Migration Act 1958 had expanded to 744 pages with the additional Regulations \ncomprising nine volumes totalling an additional 1,993 pages,c and clearly containing much greater \ndetails of the rules that applied to the administration of migration.  \nIt is important, however, to recognise that the growth in regulation—both the number of issues being \nregulated and the increasing complexity of those regulations—is not specific to migration alone. As \nshown below, the number of pages of primary legislation in Australia has increased significantly in \nrecent decades, and most particularly since the 1970s. This is mirrored, for example, by regulatory \nincreases in other countries such as the United States (see below).\n66 IOM, 2017b.\n67 Czaika and de Haas, 2014.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 19\n      Number of pages of federal legislation                                 Number of pages of federal regulations \n                        passed in Australia, 1901–2006                      added to the United States federal \n                     register, 1936–2010\n                    \nSource:  Berg, 2008.            Source:  Crews, 2012.\nAn important consequence of increasing regulation—both in terms of its sophistication as well as its \noverall coverage—is the impact on perceptions of State control. The more States regulate aspects of \nsocial and economic life, the more they strengthen the perception that phenomena can be regulated \nand controlled, even those occurring transnationally and beyond the direct control of national or \nsub-national regulators. This ‘regulation-expectation’ paradox poses considerable challenges for \nStates, not least of which involves explaining to citizens and societies the impact of globalization on \na range of aspects of daily life, including migration. And yet in many countries, there remains the \npopulist discourse that immigration can be ‘controlled’ when the reality brought about by increasing \ninterconnectedness means that migration ‘management’ is far more applicable. Against this broader \nbackdrop of the evolution of migration regulation, recent developments in transnational connectivity \ntake on heightened relevance with potentially profound implications, including for the deepening of \nthe regulation-expectation paradox.\nc   Kelly, 2005.\nSource:  Abridged excerpt of a book chapter on regulating international migration (McAuliffe and Goossens, 2017).\nConclusions\nGlobalization processes are altering aspects of daily life in the modern era. Recent advances in transportation \nand telecommunications technology have heralded massive changes in how we access information and interact \nglobally in real time. Increasing transnational connectivity is shaping how people move internationally in \nways that were not previously possible. While access to such technology remains uneven across the world, the \ncontinuing extension of advanced telecommunications means that greater numbers of people are connected \nonline. This chapter has examined what this increasing transnational connectivity means for mobility and \nmigration and how related processes are being shaped. \n', 'Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity20\nWe have seen that transnational connectivity has uneven and varied impacts on migrants and States, in terms \nof shaping migration processes. However, it is perhaps clearer than ever before that non-State actors are playing \nan increasing role in migration through the application of advanced telecommunications and other technology \n(such as drones). While the expansion of non-State actors in international migration processes has distinct \nbenefits, such as in the field of humanitarian assistance for migrants, it also has some potentially negative \neffects, such as facilitating the expansion of human trafficking networks transnationally. \nThe complex interactions between greater interconnectedness and international migration processes are of \ngrowing importance. While the drivers of migration may remain largely unchanged, the circumstances in which \npeople are considering and making decisions about their migration options have changed considerably, and it is \nin this context that we highlight the following implications for policy.\n• Continued investments need to be made in developing technologies that can be used by migrants to \navoid dangerous and possibly deadly migration pathways as well as abuse and exploitation. Innovative \nways of using technology, social media and apps (such as the mobile phone application, MigApp, by \nIOM to provide migrants with access to reliable and practical information on migration processes and on \nservices in destination countries) can support and facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration.\n• Such technologies need to be rolled out and made available on a more even basis. The recent \nimprovements in global connectivity, even in some of the more remote and least developed countries, \nneeds to be further supported so that new technologies and applications (such as those related to \nmobile money) can assist communities worldwide and reduce the risk of uneven implementation. \n• While States have invested in technology based on real-time connectivity to enhance their ability \nto monitor borders and detect and prevent irregular entry into their territory, similar investments \nin analytical capability are needed for a better understanding of the incremental shifts in \nmigration processes, including in relation to how migrants think about and assess their migration \noptions.\n• As globalization and transnational connectivity deepen, further research on the impact on human \nrights of the indiscriminate sharing of personal data is necessary to support more effective \npolicy responses, including on global governance of migration. \n• Finally, greater recognition of the role of technology in migration management will be central in the \ndevelopment of global responses, such as the 2018 global compact on migration. Although greater \nconnectivity and the ability to move information, money and ideas in real time may pose challenges, \nespecially in curbing illicit and unsafe migration activities, it is likely that some of the most effective \nresponses can also be found in emerging technology.\n', 'WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018 21\nReferences\nAbdullahi, B.\n 2016 The world is not as globalized as you think.
