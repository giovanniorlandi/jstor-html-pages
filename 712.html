Dec. 9. ? Possibilities\nthat the kaiser\'s death might lead to\na sudden peace had much to do today\nwith bringing about a decided down\nturn in the price of wheat. The mar\nket closed heavy, %@lc to lfte under\nlast night* Corn finished l-16c to %c\noff, oats<down 1A@%e to He and pro\nvisions varying from 5c decline a rise\nof 2Vfcc.\nStatements that the kaiser had\npneumonia and was in a serious con\ndition made news regarding him be\ncome all at once of prime importance\nto the wheat pit It waB not, how- -\never, until the last hour of trading\nthat his illness bad any effect on the\nmarket, as up to that time the ail\nment was supposed to be merely an\nordinary cold. On the other hand,\ntraders here were quick to act on the\nidea that the treacherous nature of\npneumonia might easily in his case\nresult in more immediate radical\nchanges of the European situation\nthan the military outlook had seemed\nto warrant. The selling that follow\ned was shared in by some of the larg\nest houses on \'change.*\nPrevious to the flurry about Em- 1\nperor William\'s condition, the wheat ]\nmarket hadk shown a hardening tend\nency due to export pales, frost In Ar\ngentina and the talk of persistent lack 1\nof adequate moisture for the winter\ncrop in western Kansas. Primary re\nceipts continued surprisingly large,\nbut were perhaps fully offset by rea\nson of a big decrease in the needed\narea of winter wheat in Russia.\n? Export sales of 300,000 bUBhels\nmade the corn market comparatively\nfirm, despite the weakness of wheat.\nWet weather and the consequent less\nening of receipts tended also toward\nsteady prices, although speculative\nselling caused at one time a moderate i\nsag.\nOats suffered from the slowness of ,\neastern demand. Shorts here were\nprincipal buyers. y\nProvisions bulged in sympathy with <\nthe hog market. The effect wore off, i\nhowever, when subsequently the ad- ]\nvance at the yards was lost.\nO i\nCAINEtlY TALKED\nOF FOR PRODUCE!\n\'\'The possibility of establishing a can\nning factory for small fruits and vege\ntables in Reno Is engaging the atten\ntion of Secretary Stevenson and other\nofficers of the Reno Commercial Club\nand correspondence is now being con\nducted with the industrial agent of\nthe Union Pacific system who writes\nthat be has many letters from people\nwith capital who are anxious to se\ncure a start in new localities.\nThe mOk canning factory suggested j\na few months ago is still under con\nsideration. About tbe only stumbling\nblock at thin time is believed to be the\napathy of the farmers who would\nrather not. take the trouble to care for\ncows, even though It might mean a\nlarger net income. A representative\nof the interests desiring to establish\na milk condensary here is expected in\nReno within a short time.\nIn referring to the suggested fruit\nand vegetable cannery attention is\ncalled to the rapid development in\nUtah wheijB under conditions that are\nconsidered no/better. than those on the\nTruckee Meadows, a small cannery\nwas started and soon grew to ijuch\nproportions that a number of similar\nplants were erected. Now ft is re\nported, a factory Is being built simply\nto make cans for the various can\nneries.\nIt Is believed that conditions are\ngood in this part of the state to start\na canning industry. The suggestion\ncommends Itself particularly because\nthere would be a large local market\nfor the output, the Nevada population\nbeing accustomed to consuming a\nlarge proportion of canned stuff#. A\nfurther indication that such a venture\nwould be successful. Is found in the\ncharacter of th4 farming population\naround Reno. There is a large per\ncentage of Italians and H Is believed\nthat these farmers could be depended\nupon to raise large quantities of fruits\nand vegetables by Intensive cultiva\ntion if a market was afforded.\nUnder the present conditions the\nmarket Is limited to the amount of\nfresh frultjs and vegetables that the\npublic can consume within a short\ntime. Am a result, production la cur\ntailed so as not to glut the market.\nIt Is believed that, a cannery to ab\nsorb surplus fruits and vegetable*\nwould be a snftoe#* here and would be\nfollowed by the establishing of simi\nlar factories in other western Nevada\nvalleys. Among the products that\nmight be rait?4 with success, peas.\nMRS. EVA ALBW I\nGIVEN DIVORCE\nJudge Ducker ?ttlng For Judge\nTaber Grants\nDecree\nMrs. Eva Albin, in the district\ncourt yesterday, was given a decree of\ndivorce from her husband, Clyde Al\nbin. The case was brought some\nweeks ago but has Just been brought\nto trial. Judge Ducker, of Winne\nmucca, sitting for Judge Taber, who is\nabsent from the city, heard the case\nand rendered the decree. Mrs. Albin\nIs a sister of Forest Supervisor, S. B.\nArthur, of Gold Creek, who was an at\ntendant at the trial and immediately |\nafter the decree was granted, left for\nthat place with Mr. Arthur, where she\nwill pay an extended visit.\nO ,\nQUARANTINE. ALL EMPTIES\nOn accoufit of the stock quarantine\nthe Southern Pacific has been busy ,\nduring the last month disinfecting ev\nary empty car that passes through\nrruckee. More than 300 cars have .\nbeen disinfected at that place up to ,\nthe present time. The work will con\ntinue until all quarantines are raised.\n[\nN. C. 0. LANDS\nThat the Nevada-California-Oregon\nRailway company 1b preparing (or\nambitious work along the lines of\ncolonization in the north for the .com\ning: spring, was the statement yester\nday of M: Kelson of the Colonization\ndepartment of. the company, who has\noffices at 451 Phelan building, San\nFrancisco. /\nAlready twenty-Ave Russian famil\nies have been placed to advantage on\nfarms to the north and in the first\npart of A^ril about 30 more families\nwill move there to take up their\nhomes and cultivate the soil under\nmuch better conditions than those\nprevailing in the districts of northern\nSiberia whence they came-.\nEvery day, according to Keison,\nProm 15 to 25 persons call at the San\nFrancisco offices to make inquiries\nibout lands.
