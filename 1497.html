PRICE TEN CENTS, ANOTHER BIG SHIP IS SUNK, FEARED TEN AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LOST, - , ! L .fffgg, OF SALE Pit, tv, • ,J -, (By Associated Tress), WASHINGTON. D. 0., June 30.—, Justice Wendell Stafford, of the Su, preme Court of the District of Colum, bia, who has been considering the, action brought by the American bond, holders of the Alaska Northern to re, strain the government from paying, over the purchase price of the road to, the Canadian bondholders, today de, nied the motion of the plaintiffs asking, that one-tenth of the purchase price, of the. road be paid Into court to be, held until the suit was determined., This was asked in order to protect, any interest in the money that the, American bondholders, E. A. Shedd &, Co., and John It. Thompson of Chi, cago, might have. The Canadian ven, dors were given until August 20, by, the court, to defend before him the, allegations of fraud and conspiracy, made by the American bondholders., The attorneys for Secretary of the, Interior and the Alaska Railroad Com, mission assured Judge Stafford that, the government would withhold the, payment of one-half million of the pur, chase price until August 20., -:o:, All the Real News in the Times., -«■ .. \'L- . ...—"», He reports that 29 lives were lost and ten persons, injured. Of the Anrerican pnssengers on the boat, so, far ten have not been accounted for, and it is* feared, they are dead. The Armenia is a British ship with, a burden of H800 tons, and sailed from Newport, News bound for Avonmouth, England. It is not, j explained why the disaster to the Armenia has not, [been made public before. It must have been known, to the British authorities, unless the life boats of, the Armenia were delayed in reaching shore because, of rough weather. Consul Holland, has been cabled, to by the state department to forward the full story, of the affair as soon as the details are available. No, names of the Americans on the boat have been, learned as yet, nor has the consul sent in the names, of the ten Americans whom lie classes as missing., CORDOVA’S EXPORTS GROWING, IS NOW THE LARGEST IN ALASKA, The steamer Alameda that left here, yesterday morning for Seattle took on, board at this port 1156 tons of copper, ore, and 5,000 cases of salmon. This, has become Buch a common occur, rence to us In Cordova that we fall, to realize Just what It means. If one, would stop and think however, he, would realize the astonishing fact, that the boats leaving Cordova for, Seattle get more freight In this port, alone, than they get In Seattle for all, the towns they touch at coming north., That Is a concrete example of how, great the exports of Cordova have, mounted this summer, and this is but, a beginning. ,, The Alaska Syndicate is preparing, to spend *10,000,000 in further develop, ing Its copper properties in the Cop, per Ulver valley. The Immense ship, ments of ore that are now leaving, Cordova for Tacoma come only front, one mine. The shipments could be In, creased ten fold within a short time, with the proper railroad development., That part of this $10,000,000 will be, used to purchase other valuable cop, per properties along the line of the, railroad seems to be reasonably as, sured. This will mean that the Syndi, cate can build spurs from the present, railroad to its new mines, and place, more of them on a shipping basis. The, only thing that keeps the Mother bode, mine from being an all the year round, shipper is the fact that the mine is, 13 miles from the railroad, and the, only way to get the ore down the trail, Is to sled it when the snow comes. The, Mother bode mine could be sending, out as much ore per month as the, i, Kennecott mine if a spur was built,, and proper development machinery, installed. f, This brings Cordova to tlie fore as, the premier port of Alaska sri the point, of exports. More wealth bops out of, Cordova to the states than any city or, town in Alaska, bar none. This fact, was conclusively proved by the Cham, ber of Commerce in the brief sub, mitted by it to the Kailrcad Commis, sion last fall, before the government, picked the route for their road. The, unanswerable facts of tonnage were, for some reason ignored by the Com, mission, and there has txeen much1 ad, verse criticism by various, newspapers, throughout the country because of, that fact. Investigations show noth, ing In the line of tonnage along the, j Susitna route to the Interior except, the Matanuska coal. That is all that, has been uncovered that is positive,, although one may hear various stories, of rich mines in the Broad Pass coun, try and elsewhere., The truth is. however, that the, shipments from Cordova, are actual, and real, they are not estimates, they, are not in the future, and they spell, tonnage in large letters. Practically, all the boats of the Alaska Steamship, Company are being used to carry the, southbound freight of Cordova. Even, the boats running to Nome, are com, ing back this way to relieve the con, gestion of ore at the dock. Every, available car of the railroad is in com, mission this summer and being, worked to its full capacity. And still, the ever growing tide of copper ore, keeps coming to Cordova for trans, shipment to Tacoma, and the trains, that are bringing down the ore are, carrying from Abercrombie a carload, or two or three of canned salmon on, every trip to swell Cordova\'s tonnage,, while here at Cordova we have two, more canneries sending out their sil, ver horde properly canned for the, markets of the world., When it comes to actual business, showing of tier mines and fisheries., Cordova\'s lead over the other cities, of Alaska lias been well established., The value of the salmon shipped, monthly from here is in the tens of, thousands, while this niontTf over two, million dollars worth of copper ore, was sent from here to Tacoma. What1, other city in Alaska can boast of as, much. And like a famous American, once said, “We have not yet begun to, fight.”, ANCIlORACiE, June 30. — Nl, tundred and fifty men are now e, >loyed on the government railroad, he vicinity of this city. Twej, niles of the road, from here to Eaj, iliver will have the rails laid, September 1. The wages are ab<, |G per day., (Ed. Note.) This telegram receiv, rrom Seattle today is a sample of t, booming that is being done by sotc, body, presumably the government o, eials, in an effort to boost the prt, of lots at the sale that is going, take place at the new townslte i, July 9. It is well known that the wa, Beale for laborers is 37% cents p, hour, which at an eight hour di, makes $3 per day. Of this amou, $1 is deducted for board. Thf*7e Is 1, work on Sundays. The men can thei, fore make $18 per week, from whU, $7 must be deducted for board, lea, ing $11 clear. This is the truth aboi, wages, and somebody is spreading, fnlse impression for a reason., The Edith should have arrived i, Latouche last night from Nome an, will be in Cordova soon., ENGLAND TO LIST LABOR, UP TO SOL OF SIXTY-FIYE, TjONDON, .Tune 30—Secretary Long of the, London Government Board, lias introduced in the, House of Commons a measure for the compilation, of a national register, of working men. The object, of the bill as stated by the author is not to coerce, trades people and members of the labor unions, but, to secure complete information regarding the, resources of the country, and to assist the govern, ment in satisfactorily organizing such resources., The measure classifies all persons, of both sexes,, under the age of sixty five, ripcords their present, occupation, and the direction wherein service can be, rendered by each., PREMIER ASQUITH EXHORTS, . RICH TO SET EXAMPLE, LONDON, June JO.—Premier Asquith, in a, speech to the members of the Uuild at their hall, today rcommended economy to the promoters of the, guild meetings, who have been noted for the extrava, gance in the matter of expenditures. The Premier, said that he believed that the rich men of the nation, should support the British war loan and set nn, example of thrift to the people of a nation burdened, with an expenditure of fifteen million dollars a day, for purposes of war., NEW ZEAUrPREPARES, ‘ DEVOTE ENERGY TO WAR, WELLINGTON, N. Z., June 30—Premier Mas, sey announced today, that the New Zealand govern, ment was prepared to form a national military min, istry until the close of the war. The purpose of the, new ministry is to promote the conserving and con, centrating of the resources of the country, in order, that, the whole energies of New Zealand may be em, ployed in the prosecution of liositilities., BERLIN, June 30—The official German state, ment this afternoon announces that the army under, General Linsingen has driven the Russians across, the Ohelalipa river., SAN FRANCI8CO, June 30—\'The ex, secretary of state, William Jetjnings, Bryan will arrive In this city the last, of the week to keep a program of, speaking dates which have been ar, ranged for him. The city is prepared, to welcome ltB distinguished guest,, and special preparations have been, made by the fair officials to do him, honor.

On July 7, he, will resume his efforts In behalf oi, the peace of the world, by addressing, the meeting of the International Con, ference of Women Workers for the, Promotion of Peace., .• n * -, COPPER RIVER VALLEY TOWNS, TO OO DRY TOMORROW i, Three towns in the country contigu, ous to Cordova go dry at midnight., Chlttna and McCarthy voted dry,, while a license was refused at Katalla, because there Is no longer a deputy, marshal stationed there., -;0;, MIbb Lila McKenxie, a sister of Mrs., Len Cox. will arrive from Beattie on, the Northwestern tomorrow, and will, go out to Mile 56 to visit with Mr., and Mrs. Cox. Mrs. Cox la In town, to meet her sister, who is on her first, visit to Alaska., -:o:, There will be no show at the Em, press Friday night, but there will be a, big ahow Monday night to help cele, brate the holiday.

The train was scheduled, for tomorrow but was put off a day to, accommodate the passengers on the, Northwestern., LONDON, June JO.—The Russian people are, far from being down heartened or discouraged over, tin* recent ad verses administered I to their armies by, tin* Teuton forces. Instead the ^Russian government, is replying to tin* brilliant series of Teuton victories, by establishing a Munitions Board, which lias been, given the power to spend money without limit for, the promotion of the war, and the proper equipment, of the Russian armies, and has also been given, unlimited power over all private industries, with, authority to direct the Activities of private con, corns into such channels as may be most advan, tageous for the government. Throughout Russia,, the people are united as never Before in their opposi-j, Jtion to the Austro-Gernmns, and they are determined, to see that this is a fight to a finish. There is no, peace party in Russia, and wilt not be until Russia, and her allies are in a position to dictate the terms., The whole country now realises that the disasters, to the Russian arms, have not been because of lack, of courage or fighting qualities among the soldiers,, or lack of proper leadership, but is due sole ly to the, lack of guns and munitions to properly equip the, immense armies that Russia hais put into tin* field., The new Munitions Board will bend every eiffort, and, use the combined resources of the entire country to, see that this deficiency in munitions is immediately, I remedied. * *4, _• 1 m r, .1, I ^, 1, ir O " * c, LONDON, June 30.—The power of the .Teutons, lias not been broken in the east, and thfir armies, continue to drive hack the Slav all alosig the line, from eastern Galicia northward, and well .into, Russian Poland. Despite stubborn resistance and, contesting every foot off tin* ground, the Gussian, soldiers are being competed to give way Indore the, steady continuous pn*s»uire of the. Austro-t lenirtun, assaults. Even when recreating the Bussianw con, tinue their desperate fighting, and) they do not fall!, back until it is absolute^ necessary in order to save, themselves from annihilation. Although the vittorv, has been with the advancing Teutons, .it has boon, purchased at a heavy cost for the retreating Rus, sians have inflicted tremendous losses upon; the, Austro-Gennans. k jA k j, HUN NOT YET I, CORNISH, N. H„ June 30.—Presi, dent Wilson is enjoying his visit here |, to the full. He spends his time be, tween the golf links, and taking l<#ng |, rides around the country in his motor, car. In answer to a query put to him, today, the president said that he ha, not yet abandoned all idea of visiting, the Panama-Pacific Exposition at San, Francisco, this summer, but that he, feared that press of public business, would prevent him from doing so. A, visit to the exposition was enticing he, admitted, but said that he could not, afford to he too long away from Wash, ington in the present state of the, nation\'s foreign affairs., I, Bartenders Beware, The Counter Jumpers of Cordova, iereby accept and ambrace the chal, enge Issued by tho water-logged bar, enders of Cordova to mortal combat, in the ball field next Sunday, July, th. In deigning to teach these, tarrys of the ball field the rudiments, if the national pastime, we trust they, will appreciate the honor conferred, i|ion them., -:o:->—, Heed Ye Bartenders, We, of the Guggenheim clan, slaves, nf the steel tail, who toll but do not, Bpln, have had our ire aroused by |, perusing In ye newspaper a challenge j, to play ye game of baseball. We., know naught of what this game may, lie, but are confident that ye guild;, of bartenders know less, and so, we, agree to appear upon ye field of battle!, with proper tools nnd working clothes, on Sunday, July 4, and reduce ye bai^, tenders to pulp., -:o:--—, They tell us that at Anchorage it, takes 12 hours after the matt is de, livered to the postoftlce before the, people commence to get their letters., -:o:—, \\ letter received on the last boat, from Aucherage says, "The weather is, fine here, but that is about all.”, TRIESTE SOON IN DANGEI, 0 ——- - ■ ■ —, LONDON, .Tune 30—\'The Italian advanc, through the Alps is slow but steady, and (1 t iler;, E’aneva is fully satisfied with the progress that hi, soldiers are making. Unless Austria brings larg, reinforcements at once, it seems probable that til, city of Trieste will fall. The Italians are daily draw, ing closer to the seaport, hut Trieste will be defender, obstinately and there will be much bloodshed befor, the city is taken., BERLIN, June JO Chancellor Bethmann, FTollweg, ami Foreign Minister Jmiuni, returned ti, ;his city today from Vienna. While in the Austro, capital, the German statemen held important eon, t’erenees with the political leaders of Austria-Hun, Tary. They both expressed the opinion that, Rouraania would remain neutral., asquith Mines give ., THE TERMS Of PEACE, LONDON, June GO.—Premier Herbert Asquith, told the Horse of Commons today in answer to an, interrogatory propounded by a member, that the, government could not at this time, from motives of, expediency, make a statement concerning what terms, of peace would be suitable to Great Britain., NORWEGIAN SHIPS SUNK \', CARGO OF WHEAT IS LOST, LONDON, June JO. The Norwegian ship, Neambuskenneth, bound from Portland, Oregon to, Liverpool with wheat, was sunk today by a German, submarine. The crew were saved. Another sub, marine sunk the Norwegian steamer Gjeso, 1,100, tons. The crew of this vessel were also saved., w, Special to The Times By Associated Press., WASHINGTON, I). (\\, June 30.—It has just, been made public that the Dominion liner Armenia, was attacked and sunk by the German submarine, (J-J8 at 8 o’clock the evening of June 28th, 29 miles, northwest of Cornwall, England. The news was, received at the State Department today in a dispatch, from American Consul Armstrong, at Bristol, Eng.]', '[he Cordova Daily Times, GREATER CORDOVA\'S GREATEST NEW8PAPER, ASSOCIATED PRE88 TELEGRAPHIC REPORTS., H.

Think of sending a tele, .’ain to the Seattle papers boosting Anchorage as the railroad, rminal, with coal bunkers, docks, etc., to be erected, and, Ivising the people of the country that the steamers Watson, id Mariposa would leave Seattle in time to reach Anchorage, r the sale. That is advertising a land sale with a vengeance., -:o:, They say that a roster of the employees of the Railroad, ommission at Anchorage reads like the roll call of a regiment, Serbian reserves. A recent letter from the new town asserts, lat a plain Amrican has to beg for work enough to earn the, rice to get a plate of beans., -;o;, THE TOLL OF WAR, Nothing seems to be happening in this great world of ours, ccept fighting. They are warring to the north of us, and to, ic south of us and the clash of arms is taking up the attention, t the whole world. We read about doctors, college professors,, riests and ministers in the army. What can the result be?, othing but retrogression. The best blood of the nation goes, ) war and gets killed. The weaker men, the less fitted remain, imie and become the progenitors of the next generation. Thus, oes war leave its heavy hand upon the people long after the, tst gun is fired. For the life of a nation at war has received a, ?t. back. This country is but now recovering from the effects, [ our Civil War, when the slaughter was not nearly so great, •i the awful carnage in Europe. With Europe at war, and, merica at peace nothing can prevent the United States from, ecoming pre-eminent among the nations of the world. This, ill not happen as some critics of our neutrality assert, because, e will selfishly try to grab our neighbors’ trade while they, re fighting, but because the war will take such a toll of the, est blood and brains of England, France and Germany, that, lose countries will lose caste because they lack the raw, mterial, namely virile, rugged, strong men, and plenty of them,, hurches can be rebuilt, towns reconstructed, and new homes, lade, but a human life lost is gone forever. The wonderful, rain of a genius gets no more respect from a bullet than the, ulled intellect of a drunken sot. War plays no favorites,, xcept to show a tendency to help tin* grim reaper harvest the, est of the youth of the nation. If Germany loses her vast, jreign trade she will have the war to blame, and not the people, f the United States, who thanks to the wisdom of the great, aider at Washington, has so far kept her hands free from, lood., -:o:-—, When you stop and consider that the boats leaving Cor, ova for the south get more south bound tonnage from this, ort alone, than they get northbound for all the ports of Alaska, ;aving Seattle, you can begin to realize how important the, 3wn of Cordova is to the territory, and how much truth there, ms in the statement of the Chumber of Commerce to the Ruil, oad Commission last summer, that this was the only tonnage, oute for a railroad into Alaska., -1-:o:, If the news received yesterday is true to the effect that, he English have been trying to secure recruits in San Francisco, ; puts Johnny Bull in a bad light. Do the people of England, mnt to fight their own battles? The story seems incredible, nd decidedly unworthy of a great nation., OUR DEBT TO OUR FOREFATHERS, Let us nil remember that the Fourth of July is Independ, ence Day. Let us all be Americans nnd forget this foolish war, which is trying to divide our people into parties with hyphens, to express their nationality. We are all more or less foreigners l, in this country of the United Stats except the Indians. They, are the only natives. But we are free from the European idea,, and most of our forefathers came to this country to avoid the, evils of European governments, which were so prone to war. If, they had not done so, most of us today would either be fighting, for the king, the Kaiser, the Czar or sunny France. Let us be, thankful that our fathers had the wisdom to shake off the, European shackles, and let us try to keep that point of view, rather than to allow our natural sympathy for the land of our, forebears makes us forget that this land of our forebears, did not treat our forefathers well enough to make them, want to remain. Then you will begin to see that there, is an American point of view in this war, and we don’t all feel, the same way as the people in the old country do. The Fourth, of July should do much to make us one people, nnd so let us all, join in and honor the patriots who made it possible for us to be, free from this horror that is going on in Europe., -:o, Our Seward friends got peeved because the officials in, charge of the sale of lots at Anchorage sent out an advertising, circular by wire to the states, in which Anchorage was men, tioned as tin* railroad terminal. They say the Seward Com, mercial Club summoned the offending official before them, and, demanded an explanation. The next day the Gateway explained, it all by saying that a comma had been put in the wrong place., Seward real estate took an awful slump when the wording of, the telegram became known., -:o:, For a dissatisfied bunch of people go to Anchorage. Inter, view anybody on the government’s methods of disposing of tl^*, lots there, and you will probably lx* treated to more plain and, fancy cussing than you ever heard in your life before., -;o;-., The statement given the Times yesterday is an enlighten, ing exposition of the real situation and the possibilities at, Anchorage. Facts are facts, and so far there has been nothing 1, to demonstrate tin* necessity of a rush to Anchorage., —-:o:, Kaiser Wilhelm and Uncle Sam are beginning to feel that, their difficulty was nothing but a misunderstanding, and they, are both preparing to shake hands and “Gesundheit.” It is, tlx* better way., -:o:, They say that the kiddies are going to have some swell, costumes for the Fourth of July, and if they only knew what, swell prizes the committee was preparing for them, they would, surely be a hot competition for them., -:o:, King Canute and his famous effort to tell the sea to stand, still may have a counterpart, when the government officials get, ordering around the slush ice at the head of Cook’s Inlet., -:o:, Cordova is going to have some celebration on the Fourth, of July, and everybody that remains in town will be assured, of a good time., TERMINAL TROUBLES TO WESTWARD, Wo, in Cordova, might have been disappointed, and, ubtless were, when Seward was announced as the railroad, ■minal by the president. We swallowed our disappointment,, d extended our congratulations sincerely to our neighboring, y. We thought it was settled, and honestly rejoiced with, ward in her good fortune. As far as we in Cordova are, ncerned we have nothing more to worry about. We are not, ing to be a government town, and our mind is clear. The, owledge that the matter is settled against us is much better, an the previous uncertainty. We will go on courageously, ing all we can to develop the Copper River Valley by trying, induce private capital to develop our resources. We feel that, e government has made a mistake, but we are not crying, er it. Of one thing we are certain, and that is, that today, * are in a better position than Seward, and for this reason,, rer in the westward town, they are at sixes and sevens on the, ilroad situation. Although selected as the ocean terminus, the railroad by the president, the commission seems to be, nding every effort to make Anchorage an all the year round, rt, and if they do that, why Anchorage will naturally become, e terminal, for it would not pay to ship coal to Seward over, e railtoad, when it could reach the tide water in any month, the year at Anchorage. This would mean that Seward would, t a little passenger traffic, and would make that town nothing, are or less than the terminal of a branch line. Our friends in, ward deserve better luck than this, hut tin* fact remains, that, dging from what is going on at Ship Creek, the average, wardite is a very much worried man. Here in Cordova, we, »ep easy of nights. We have our own little railroad, that, ings over two million dollars worth of ore a month to the, ast and which has unlimited tonnage possibilities before it., le problem of government assistance in the railroad line has, *en settled against us, and we have nothing more to think, •out, and so can go about our daily work and do the best we, n to explain to the general public, and particularly tin*, vesting public, what a rich field for development lies in the, untry contiguous to Cordova. We certainly would hate to be, the position that Wilson had picked Cordova for the govern, ent terminal of the railroad, and be worrying our fool heads, f because the men he sent up here to do the job were trying to, ake Katalla the terminus., —— —. . • _, ¥ 1, One Visit, Will, Make You, A, Regular Patron, At |, *, Slater’s j, Restaurant, Private Boxes, For j, Large or Small, Parties, Fast and commodious steamers sailing between Seattle, Ketch, ikan, Wrangell, Juneau, Skagway, Cordova, Valdez, Seward and, SHIP CREEK, via INSIDE PASSAGE, Sails from Seattle— Sails from Cordova—, June 24.NORTHWESTERN.July 4, June 30.MARIPOSA.July 10, Regular freight service for Ketchikan, Juneau, Sheep Creek,, Treadwell, Douglas, Cordova, Ellamar, Valdez ard Latouche.

The former Falrbanksar, ■, was convicted about two years ago ol, murder and was sentenced to life lm, prlsonment. She has been a model, prisoner, and Mrs. Maude Balllngton, Booth, of the Volunteers of America, has Interested herself In the case., Mrs. James says there are two women, In Alaska who might bo able to render, her considerable assistance In her flghl, for liberty. These two women art, Mabel Mooro and Mrs. Y. Myers, known as “Texas Bose." Neither ol, the women Is now in Fairbanks, but, both are in Alaska., Her Story, I With the four walla of a cheerless, prison shutting her off from the world, in which she reveled and loved, Mabel, Page James, one of the most popular, women In Fairbanks in the enrly dayH, of this camp, Is pining her life away., She was convicted of murder, cold, blooded murder, and unless some new, and substantial evidence can be pro, cured that will throw over her prison, garb the cloak of n reasonable doubt,, she will die without the comfort and, solace of friends, without the sustain, ing arm of her husband to rest upon., The Mabel Page You Knew., In the days when the lights burned, brightly, when the tables were run, ning, and wine, women, mirth and, laughter was the order of the day,, Mabel Page came to Fairbanks. Bho, came over the trail from Valdez with, Kdwln Marston, at that time the owner, of the Fairbanks block. Mabel was, a Jewess. She was about five feet, seven Inches tall, a brunette, with a, well rounded figure. The most notice, able thing about her was her eyes;, large, brown orbs that told a story all, their own. If you had ever seen Mabel, Page you could never forget her. Vi, vacious, full of life, a good fellow in, every sense of the word, she soon had, a host of friends., On the elgthteenth of October, 1904,, she was married to William James,, the first discovery of gold on Fair, banks creek. To his claim on 8 be, low, Fairbanks creek, James took his, bride. Will all the genuine pleasure, of a person who saw only the happier, side of the world. Mabel James en, tered upon her new duties. Her kind, ness, her sunny nature, her winning, smile soon made her the most popular, woman on the creek. She was one, ray of sunshine during the long winter, months that never failed to warm the, heart of the struggling pioneer. Her, home was the most beloved place on, the creek. Here men came worn out, after a day’s labor to bask in the sun, shine of her Bmlle, to hear her witty, talk, to read a story of love, human, love. In her wonderful eyes., me Call of the Blood., For over four years she managed the, messhouse of her husband. Mabel, James played no small part in the de, velopment of the creek her husband, discovered. She was a happy, loyal, wife, but the time came when she, longed to see her old mother In their, little home in Melrose, Massachusetts., Throughout the years that she had, been away from home. Mabel James, had been a steady contributor to the, support of her mother. Idltarod had, JuBt been struck, so she decided to go, outside that way. From Fairbanks, she went to the lower river, from there, to her home In Melrose. Fairbanks, has never seen her since 1909, but, there are many here who will bo sorry, to learn of her later life., The Power of Gold., From Idltarod all the way across the, continent Mabel James traveled to see, that happy mother. She communicat, ed regularly with her husband. After, she had spent some time with her par, ent the lure of the north and the desire, to see her husband called her. She, I answered that call as full of the hap, piness and the love of life as she had, always been., In San Francisco she met the man, for whose death she Is paying the, dearest price that she can pay; for, life Imprisonment !b worse than death, Itself to one who enjoyed her liberty, as Mabel James enjoyed hers., The man she met was wealthy. He, owned a string of the finest horses that, were ever seen In California. In, Mabel Page James he saw all that was, good and true and appealing In wo, manhoood. He showered gifts upon, her. Her every wish was his com, mand. Together they traveled the, circuit of the race tracks of California, ; while his horses won purse after purse, for their owner. Finally the season of, racing closed. Anxious to please the, woman of his affection, her lover sug, gested a trip to London and Paris., Reluctantly Mabel James agreed. The, , lure of the North was still upon her, 1 But the generous treatment she re, ceived from the man who worshipped, her soon made her forget. In London, and on the continent every artifice that, appeals to a woman was bestowed on, Mabel James. Clothes, Jewelry, flow, ers, were hers In abundance. Her, dark beauty was set off as It had never, been set off before. Her eyes still told, the same story though, the story of, love and of happlneses., The Wages of 8ln., Together they returned to New, York There they went to the Metro, politan hotel. The Metropolitan hotel, is situated at the extreme end of Man, hattan Island. From the windows one, can look out over New York bay. It, Is not one of the flashy hotels of the, big city. It is a quiet, refined place,, far away from the noise and the bustle, of the night life, far from the white, lights of the Great White Way. They, could be quiet there. It was Incon, spiclous. They could be happy In each, other\'s company. The future they had, planned Is unknown. In what direc, tion their paths lay no one but Mabel, James can tell., One morning, after two days of un, successful waiting, the manager of the, hotel forced the door of the suit that, Mabel James and her lover occupied., The sight he met was a gashtly one., Cold In death, his throat cut several, wounds In his body lay the lover of, Mabel James. The police were sum, moned. Forty-five thousand dollars, he was supposed to have with him, could not be found. Three days later, Mabel Page James was arrested and, held without bail to answer a charge, of murder., Life Imprisonment, The case was a circumstantial one., The money was not recovered. The, jury heard all the little circumstances., The linger of guilt pointed at a woman, that Fairbanks will never forget, a, woman that will live In the minds of, the pioneers of Fairbanks creek for, many a day. She was found guilty., With the love of life and liberty still, sparkling In her tear dimmed eyes she, heard herself sentenced to a life be, hind the cold, cheerless walls of a, state\'s prison. With a last fond look, at the faces of the men and women of, the world Bhe might never see again,, she was led over the Bridge of Sighs, to the murderers\' row in the Tombs., While There Is Life There Is Hope ., The next day the "Black Maria," a, wagon completely covered, in which, me nand women are transferred from, the Tombs to the railroad station, car, ried Mabel James to the Grand Cen, tral. At Auburn she alighted from the, train, handcuffed to two detectives, a, matron walking close behind her. In, her eyes, red from weeping, there still, lingered that love of life and pleasure, that had been a ray of hope and sun, shine to the miners on Fairbanks, creek. The sparkle of hope was still, there. The prison gate swung open., Through it walked Mabel Page James, It closed again, hiding forever from, the woman the sun of liberty. That, was two years ago; two long, cheerless, years for Mabel James. It may be, there will come a day when a new, trial can be obtained, a day of reck, onlng when the guilty one, if it is not, Mabel James, will confess his crime to, the world. It is a faint ray of hope,, much fainter than the ray that spark, led in the eyes of the woman, now but, 30 years old, who a few short years, ago was one of the most beloved of all, Fairbanks\' hardy pioneers.—Juneau, Dispatch., -:o:——-., SAYONET FIGHT, BOULOGNE, France. June 80.—The, story of a duel with bayonets lu which, both contestants were killed, Is told, In a Red Cross report from one of the, field hospitals., “Two miles south of the hospital,”, says the writer, “a French Zouave, got separated from his fellows when, they retreated after an unsuccessful, effort to take a German trench. A, German soldier leaped out of the, trench and charged the Zouave, bay, i onet fixed. The Zouave met his foe, \'in like manner and an extraordinary, duel took place.

All he carried was, a small cane, but a band he wore on, his nrm apparently was that of a staff, officer. He walked about In the open, under a continuous fire tnlking to the, men. cheering them up and rallying, them together. When they were all, ready for the bayonet charge, he, placed himself In front of them all,, and armed simply with this small, cane, led the charge up the hill. The, moral effect of the officer’s action was, great. The men charged up the hill, and cleared their enemy from his posi, tion but the unknown officer lost his, life. It now transpires that the officer, was Major Doughty-Wylie and the, hill on which he met his death is now, known as “Doughty-Wylle’s Hill.”, He had no business to be there as, he was a staff officer, but the loss, among the officers In landing had been, so great, and the necessity for making, headway quickly was so essential, that, Major Doughty-Wylie acted In the, emergency., -: o:, All the Real News In the Times., Restoration to Entry of Lands In, National Forest, Lists 6-1496,-1512,-1513,-1541., Notice Is hereby given that the, lands described below\', embracing, 469.88 acres, within the Chugach Na, tional Forest, Alaska, will be subject, to settlement and entry under the pro, visions of the homestead law\'s of the, United States and the act of June 11,, 1906 (34 Stat., 233), at the United, States land office at Juneau, Alaska,, on August 16, 1915.

This honor Is In, recognition of his distinguished ser, vice to Japanese education. Dr., Takata became president of Waseda, In 1907 and since that time the institu, tion has grown In popularity until to, day It has about 6,000 students.

These promo, tlons are interpreted as indicating the, Emperor\'s recognition and apprecla, tlon of the place that education occu, pies In modern Jupan., So great, indeed, have been the, strides made in popularizing educa, tion that Japan like the United States, Is beginning to find difficulty in plac, ing the graduates of its universities., Colleges, both governmental and pri, vate, are crowded with students who, are unable to obtain the lucrative posi, tions they have dreamed of. Not, enough plnces exist in Japnneae com, mercial and professional life to meet, the demands of the steadily increasing, number of graduates. This year\'s, graduates of the law college of the, Imperial University at Tokio number, 450 and of this number only 150 have, their future positions secured., Statistics show that from 1878 to, 1902 students were able to find places, in governmnetal service or fn business, without difficulty. Since 1903, how, ever, the situation has entirely, changed. Fifty per cent of the grad, uates have had to wait for one to, three years to find employment.
