and in\npublic speeches clearly outlined his\nacceptance and endorsement of tho\nliquor license businesses at present\nconducted It remains for the Friend\nto realize that being religious one of\nIts duties Ws to be honest Bulletin\nThats good more than good As\nour contemporary remarks one of the\nduties of a religious newspaper Is to\nbe honest -We might add that anoth\ner of its duties is to be
