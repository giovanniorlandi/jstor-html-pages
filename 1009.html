At the age of four years he\nwas adopted into the family of Chas.\nJackson of Oak Orchard, New York,\nreceiving the surname of his foster\nparents. He enlisted for service in\nthe U. S. army at the age of fifteen,\nand served nineteen months or until\nthe close of the Civil War. At the\nage of nineteen he was married to\nHelen Hoisington, who died a few\nyears later, leaving one daughter who\nlived to young womanhood. In 18S1,\nhe was united in marriaiire to Ger\ntrude Sherman at Jeddo, New York,\nand four children were born to them:\nMis. May Baker of Do wairiac. Mrs.\nLeon L. Douglas of Paw Paw, Miss\nNina Jackson of Saline, Michigan, and\nMiss Gertrude of Paw Paw. He came\nto Paw Paw with his family about\neighteen years ago, after having\nspent a few years in Illinois, and this\nvillage has been his home since that\ntime. In 1881. Dr. Jackson graduated\nfrom the college of Physicians and\nSurgeons in Buifalo, New York and in\n1884 from the Bennett Medical College\nof Chicago. He had been a member\nof the Masonic Fraternity since he\nwas twenty-one years of age, and for\na number of years had been a Knight\nTemplar. He was also a faithful\nmember of the I. O. O. F. and G. A.\nR. The funeral seivices were held\nfrom the M. E." church on Wednesday\nafternoon and were conducted by Pen\ninsular Commandary, Knight Temp\nlar of Kalamazoo of which he was a\nmember. Rev. Arthur Trott, who\nassisted in the service paid a fine\ntribute to the memory of the deceased\nHe was a man who was appreciated\nin the community for the good he had\ndone for his fellow man. The night\nwas never too dark and stormy or the\nroad too long for Dr. Jackson, when\nhis services were needed; nor did he\never hesitate by reason of the fact\nthat the sufferer was poor and not\nable to pay for medical service. He\nwas generous, kind hearted and true\nblue. A kind and indulgent husband\nand father, a good neighbor and loyal\ncitizen. He will be missed in the\ncommunity, and memories of his kind\nand generous deeds will linger long in\nthe memory of his friends. The\nbeautiful Knight Templar service was\nmost impressively rendered and was\nprobably the finest funeral of a like\nkind ever held in Paw Taw. The\nlarge number of Knight Templars\nfrom Kalamazoo, Masons and Odd\nFellows of the local lodges, and his\nold comrades of the G. A. R. who\nmarched to his last resting place in\nProgptct Cemetery, all gave eloquent\ntestimony to the respect and esteem\nin which ho was held by his fellow\n(man.\nI J\n61\nDr. F. A.

To raise armies and supply them,\nto build the navy and support it, and to furnish\nships and transport, we must have money in\nlarge amounts. The expenditures of the Gov\nernment for the ensuing year are estimated\nat $24,000,000,000, a sum which baffles the\nimagination to conceive. That vast amount\nmust come one-third from taxes and two-thirds\nfrom loans. The success of the Fourth Loan,\nlike those that preceded it is, therefore, abso\nlutely necessary. We must work with the\nhighest speed, as if the war was to end in six\nmonths. We must prepare in every direction,\nas if it was to last for years. Speed and prep\naration are both expensive.\nESkip\nWe are fighting to secure a just, righteous and lasting peace.\nFor a complete peace we must have a complete victory. It\nmust not be a peace of bargain or negotiation No peace\nwhich satisfies Germany can ever satisfy us. No peace that\nleaves Germany in a position to renew the war against us will\nbe worth having. It will be far from sufficient to gain all our\nobjects on the Western front Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine, Italia\nIrredenta. The President with wisdom and foresight and great\nforce expressed his determination to redeem Russia. Russia\nmust not be left in Germany\'s hands. That would mean\nanother war. Poland must be free. Slav republics must be\nestablished to bar the way between Germany and the East.\nSerbia and Roumania must be redeemed. All these things are\nessential. Nothing will bring them but complete victory\nand a peace dictated by us and our allies. It is a conflict\nof ideas. It is the principle of evil arrayed against the principle\nof good. It is the battle of freedom and civilization against\nbarbarism and tyranny. We must win and we shall win.\nWe - Caimir&ott Winn WMlhicratt Momey, aincd, Therefore, TlhieQe ILoaimo A?\nVWp amid titoe CoiBimfa?y Slhouald Rally aim All lifts Sftreinig\'ftlhi\namid Subscribe sunid Oversubscribe tiEne ETourftlhi ILosuni\no)\nto\nThb Space ContrlhuleJ to Winning the War by\nO\'Qrady Bros.

S.,\nDepartment of Agriculture came to\nthis county Wednesday morning ex\npecting to inspect a number of potato\nMelds; that fields which would produce\ngood healthy seed might be located.\nUnfortunately, he arrived a few days\ntoo late to do much as frosts came a\nlittle earlier than usual, and most\nfields were too badly injured to be in\na condition for inspection.\nProf. Waid has been very busy all\nover the state and left Van Ruren\nCounty until the last because of our\nnatural freedom from early frost.\nHe says, "A lot of good seed can still\nbe secured by what is known as the\nhill selection method.\nIn using this method Potato grow\ners go to the best part of their fields\nand dig each hill of potatoes by itself;\nthen save all the best types, health\niest and most productive hills for seed\nIt is a fine thing to save enough seed\nfor one\'s entire acreage by this\nmethod, but if the grower does not\nhave time to do this, enough seed for\na special seed plot next year should\nbe saved by this method.\nThis seed plot should be planted on\nthe best part of next years field and\ngiven every advantage. It should be\ngone over from time to time while\nthe vines are growing, and all the\npoor growing, sickly or diseased hills\nas well assail mixtures, pulled up and\ndestroyed.\nWe would like to see next year a\nspecial seed plot on every farm in the\ncounty where the potato crop is one\nof the main crops. The time to start\nsuch work is now in the next month\nI will be glad to help any grower get\nstarted in making hill selection at\ndigging time.\nProf. Waid, tells me that where\never he has four.d a superior field of\npotatoes this year, when he has trac\ned the source of the seed, it invaria\nbly runs back to the work of some in\ndividual who has hill selection seed.\nLet us get together and help make\nmore profitable ones of the most\nprofitable crops in the county.\nCHRISTIAN CHURCH\nNext Sunday, October 13th, will be\nRally Day at this church.

M.\nI Morning Worship 11:00 A. M.\nRev. Brown Preaches\n\'"Redemption in Christ"\nTHE PRESIDENT\'S REPLY\n, The president has met the adroit\napproach of the Qerman chancellor\nwith masterly skill. Maximilian\'s re\nquest was ambiguous, and we believe\nit was intended to be ambiguous.\nIf it was sincere, the president has\nnow given him the opportunity to\nprove his sincerity by making the\nGerman oirer clear.\n. If it was not sincere, the president\nhas prevented Maximilian from turn\ning to the German people and saying:\n"You see, we offer America peace on\n. . i i i i\nlier own terms, ana sne nas reiuseu\nthem. I have exposed the insincerity\nof her principles. I have revealed the\nreal purpose of the Allies. . You see\nnow it is to jlcstroy the German\npeople. Therefore, fight on!"\nThat was a shrewd thrust. Hut the\npresident has parried it. The situ\nation remainsyin his hands. \'\nBut the president has not only\navoided this danger. He has given\nGermany frankly and unmistakably\ntho true basis of negotiations. This\nis no acadamic acceptance of princi\nples. It is not words. It is deeds.\nHe \'has told Germany that we shall\nnot ask our allies to rest their victor\nious arms or even talk peace till the\ncentral powers have gone back to\ntheir own boundaries. "The good\nfaith of any discussion would mani\nfestly depend upon the consent of the\ncentral powers immediately to with\ndraw their forces everywhere from\ninvaded territory."\nThe president has named here the\nsine qua non of any dealings with\ncentral Europe. All America is back\nof him. He has shown Potsdam that\nhe is not walking into any trap. He\nhas given the German people stern\nwarning of the terms upon which they\nmust seek peace. It is for them to\nchoose whether they will pay now or\nlater. Chicago Tribune.\nGrave Insult.\nMrs. Kawler "Then you and young\nMr. Sharp are not on speaking terras\nany more?"

The "Memorial". is done in gilt\nletters on the customary black enamel\nled card and reads as follows:\n"In Loving Remembrance of\nAnna Waymiro\nDied Sept. 8, 1918\nGone But Not Forgotten.\nA Precious one from us has gone,\nA Voice we loved is tilled;\nA place is vacant in our home,\n1 Which never can be filled.\nGod in his wisdom has recalled,\nThe boom his love had given,\nAnd though the hjody slumbers here,\nThe sou is safe in heaven. x\nHeaders of the True Northerner will\nremember the circumstance several\nweeks ago, of an obituary notice of\nthe death of Anna Waymire, and of\nhow the next day she appeared in the\nliving flesh and threw a verbal bomb\ninto the office. This is the same\nAnna, who charges that the above\nMemorial is part of the scheme of her\nloving? husband to make it appear to\nthe world that she has gone to the\nland "From whence no Traveller ever\nReturns." There is a discrepancy in\ndates however. Her first "death" was\nin August, and the second as stated\nabove. But she still lives. There is\nno mistake about that.\nTHE LOAN\nWhat would, happen in Berlin if the\nfourth Liberty Loan should fail?\nIt will not fail if. we all do our duty.\nIt will \' not fail if- we ask ourselves\nthat question.\nWhat will happen in Berlin if the\nloan fails?\nThere would be ringing of bells and\nblowing of whistles in Berlin if the\nloan failed. There would be a thrill\nof revived hope in every Prussian\nheart. The good news would go out\nthrough Germany. "The Americans\nare weakening behind the lines the\ndollar chasers are already sick of\nwar."\nBetter than a battle won over the\nYanks in the Argonne would be the\nfailure of the loan.\nBut the loan will not fail.
