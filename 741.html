Will am .1. drum, mer, who recently opened a rural store, five miles west if Conway, near Glea, son, needed a barn at his store. He, had a good one on his residence prem, ises at Conway for which he had no, use. After figuring on the cost of, building and of tearing down, hauling, land rebuilding, he found a better, | proposition and contracted with John, Jan.es, a professional house-mover, to, transport the barn as it stands. The, barn, which is a large, two-story struc, ture, started on its long journey this, morning and had proceeded about two, blocks by noon., Miss Wilma Rruce is spending the, day in Little Rock., HAUBER’S GRAND, MATINEE DAILY, COOLEST PLACE IX COXWAY., TODAY, COME TO SCHOOL AGAIN!—LEARN THE, ALPHABET OF THE HEART.

Walsh of Mon, i tana as chairman of the resolutions, committee, instead of Senator Carter, , Glass of \\ irginia, the choice of the, j administration. Senator Glass wrote, ! the platform adopted by the Virginia, state convention, which was highly, praised by President Wilson., WILSON MEN ARRAYED, TO OPPOSE MR. BRYAN, \' —., f Fry United Prtmi, San Francisco, June 26.—As the, zero huur approaches for the Demo, cratic national convention to begin its, labors, signs multiply that adminis, tration leaders are going to have a, real fight to retain control of the, party., As the head of the opposition, Wil, liam J. Bryan is the center of atten, tion. So far, Mr. Bryan may con, duct his operations ostensibly tp have, inserted in the platform a plank in, support of prohibition and pledging, the party to its enforcement. He does, not profess much concern in regard to, the league of nations, which President, Wilson and the administration forces, consider so vital., In political circles, it is surmised, that Mr. Bryan is carefully concealing, i his hand, and will later open a direct, j attack on the league of nations as, I framed by President Wilson. This, ! position, it is asserted, was strength, ened with his announcement to the, press that the league and all other, 1 issues are minor as compared with, the question of prohibition and the, necessity of committing the D< mo, t cratic party definitely to its enforce, ment., As matters stand, Mr. Bryan is, committed only to prohibition as one, of the planks which he wishes placed, in the platform. Compared with this,, the administration is pledged to have, the convention approve the league of, nations, first, and then not to make, mention of prohibition when the plat, . form is drafted., With Mr. Bryan in the city and, known to be at work, administration, leaders have become exceedingly dis, creet and wary. They await the first, ’ .-at >n that Mr. Bryan has assailed, the Virginia platform, which is the, 1 a - of the nr e which the Wilson, >p >kt snu-r will present to the conven, t on f r approval, before the full, is trained, on the •‘Commoner.’’, In charge of the Wilson element of, tht ceiivt rt ion, which is admittedly, the strongest, are row five members, f 1 . . as W( II as Na, tional (barman Homer Cummings, a 1 Si rag " Cila-s.

Pi moo rats, favoring i wet plr.nk in the platform, received a disappointment t» day when, it became known that Gov. James M., Cox of Ohio, thought to 1-e running, on a wet platform, came out square, ly against any referee->• to the liquor, question when the platform is drafted, and adopted. His attitude was made, public 11 a statement by f- rmer Gov, ernor Campbell of Ohio, who heads, the chief delegation work g for Gov, ernor Cox., M C. ; \'I 1 .. • ! hat (tov\'er, nor Cox and his chief sut -orters stand, for rigiil enforcement f prohibition, law- already pas He added that, * I, HEARING SET, FOR OUTLAW, (By United Pruaa), Chicago, June 20.-—“Outlaw" or, ganizations of railroad workers will, determine their course of action in, the future, at a meeting to be held, here Monday.

Mr., Anderson stated he understood rail, way men in the east have voted to, walk out tonight on account of the, slowness of the federal railroad wage, board in announcing its award., WASHINGTON HEARS, WALK OUT NATIONAL, (By United Bn***), Washington, June 26.—Workers in, Washington railroad shops and ter, minals voted at a meeting this morn, ing to walk out tonight at 10 o\'clock,, unless high officials of the brother, hoods ordered them to remain on duty., This statement of the action this, morning was made by workers who, were present.

Cox to prevent the nomina, tion of William G. McAdoo, generally, regarded as the most formidable can, didate for the nomination. Emis, saries of the Palmer delegations are, said to have called at the headquarters, of Governor Cox, and asked how the, Ohio candidate would view an alli, ance framed for this purpose., According to reports, the Palmer, spokesman pointed out that the dele, gations supporting Mr. McAdoo, being, the strongest numerically, can not, make protective deals and hence, would be unable to stand against a, united front composed of both Cox, and Palmer forces. In reply, the Cox, forces are said to have told the Palm, er emissaries that they regard the at, torney general highly, but believe they, can nominate Governor Cox without, the aid of the Palmer delegates. So, fas as they know it is reported then, reply said, the attorney general is a, presidential possibiity and nothing, more.

It is a new highway, just opened up, called the Ridge, route and for nearly 100 miles the, road runs along the top or sides of, the mountain and some time I could, feel the hair on my head raise a lit, tle as we whirled around some of the, curves, and looking from the side of, the car see in the valley far below, and almost straight down and so far, that houses looked like toys. One of, my fellow-passengers told me of find, ing a man by the side of the high, way one morning nearly dead an 1 his, car a wreck, where he had gone over, the side of the road trying to go, through in the night. By the way,, this fellow-passenger was from Mari, anna, Ark., and was well acquainted, with the Newberns., Visalia is in the prune and English, walnut country and 1 saw hundieds, of acres of orchards in both of ihese., My brother, Rufus, has a prune and, young walnut orchard. Land there, is worth from $1,000 to $2,500 an, acre. Down here where they raise, citrus fruits lands runs from $3,000, to $5,000 an acre. But town proper:;, is really cheaper than back home. I, think. The cottage we have is priced, at $1,500, and is a fairy comfortable, six-room cottage with water, lights, and gas, and lot 50 by 150, but tio, sewer connections. Newer, more mod, ern houses run from $2,500 up to, $4,000, depending on finish., Best regards to you and our other, friends there. G. A.

Before he had, been materially injured, however,1, medical aid had been summoned and, matter removed., It was said that Mr. Hopkins had, sold the last lot of cakes out of a, display box in which one of the large, bakeries places its bulk products. He, was eating some of the pieces remain, ing in the bottom, when the glass, is said to have been taken into his, system. One supposition was that, the glass front of the box had been, chipped in some manner, but investiga, tions today are said to have revealed, edges on the glass., PLANS READY FOR, NEW DORMITORY, TO LET CONTRACT SOON, Grounds Being Cleared at Central, College for New Building and, Other Improvements., The architects for the new dormi-\', tory to be erected at Central College, have completed the plans and speci, fications which are now in the hands, of the printers.

Campbell said today.1, Grounds of the campus are being,, cleared so that work of construction, can be begun immediately after the:, contract has been awarded., Preparatory to the construction of, the new dormitory and the general, enlargement of Central College ex, tensive changes are being made dur, ing the summer vacation. With the, recent acquisition of several acres of, additional property to the rear of the, fonter property an extensive layout!, jf athletic gounds, parks and play-!, jrounds is being developed.

The, present athletic grounds are on the, site of the proposed new dormitory j, ind hence will have to be destroyed. |, rhe new layout, however, gives much, arger space for athletic and outdoor, "ecreations and places them behind, he administration building, thereby, jiving more privacy to the students., In the present biulding. metal, veather strips are being installed on, :he windows and doors.

Herbert, Spencer says: "Education is a pre, paration for complete living.” John, Milton says: "A complete and gener, ous education fits a man to perform, justly, skilfully and magnanimously, all the offices, both public and pri, vate. of peace and war." From the, foregoing, it seems clear that the chief, WKite Crest Flcvur, DRIED BEEF IN BULK, We can chip this for you in any quantity., SacrvitOLry Brera^d, Cole & Company, TEE HOUSE OF QUALITY, aim of the school is not cramming!, a child\'s head with arithmetic, gram-], mar, geography, history, etc., but to,, form in it correct habits of life.j, Habits and character are closely as-;, sociated. In fact character is a,, bundle of habits. To build up a, strong character, it is very necessary, to assist the child to form correct, habits while its mind is plastic., Teachers in general exert their ef-1, forts towards having their pupils do j, i certain amount of work enumerat-1, ?d in the course of study and wholly J, neglect the real aim of the sehool, :haracter building. When a boy, leaves school, his standard of effi, ciency should not be measured by the i, number of problems he can solve in, arithmetic nor by the number of geo, graphical facts he can memorize, but, rather by his general behavior or, character. Is he honest and truthful?, Is he courteous? Can he apply him, self to his work? Does he regard, the rights of others? Is he manly?, If these questions cannot be answered, affirmatively his education is a fail, ure, no matter how much geography, he knows., Children snould be early taught a, proper regard for authority. If this, principle is not instilled in them,, they will very likely make undesir, able citizens. By demanding of them, pompt obedience to school rules, the, habit for proper regard to authority, will be formed and on reaching man, hood they will not very likely violate, the law., Teachers shoulds work daily to, have their schools contribute something, towards the betterment of society, j, Hence if the schools are to be made, more useful, honesty, truthfulness and:, a proper regard for authority must!, be stressed. It is true that the work, of the teacher is often handicapped, by poor home training. Children ini, many instances enter school insolent,], disobed:ent and in open revolt against], school regulations. But under the, guidance of a teacher who has the, welfare of the child at heart, these, undesirable qualities give place to, things that will contribute to the bet, terment of society. If we would 1-1, tain our right place in the sun, our, bodies must have strong resisting pow-1, ers. A strong mind usually aecom-1, panics a strong body. Hence sani, tation and hygiene should occupy a, prominent place in every school. Even1, at the expense of some of the other, branches, it should be taught daily., The life and the health of the chil, dren are more important than arith, metic and history. J. R.
