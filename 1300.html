        <pre>["ERUSSIA1\nPrice Reduction in the Soviet Union\nBy ARTHUR B. DARLING\nA ssistant Professor of H istory, Y ale University; Current History A ssociate\nTHE elaborate report on financial, in* \ndustrial and commercial conditions in \nthe Soviet Union, recently issued by \nthe Soviet Government and summarized in \nThe New York Times on April 3, contained \nsignificant admissions* This report estab\xad\nlished the fact that all previous Soviet esti\xad\nmates with regard to money in circulation \nand credits had contained errors arising \nfrom the attempt of the Government to ex\xad\npress economic activities in which no money \nwas used in terms of money transactions. \nOne result was an overestimate of the vol\xad\nume of exports and imports, “ The wrong \nassessment of these factors,”  said the re\xad\nport, “led to excessive estimates regarding \nthe formation of capital and consequently \nto inflated issues, which in their turn gave \nrise to price increases and a dearth in com\xad\nmodities.”  And the report went on to say \nthat the effect of these errors lasted “ to \nthe end o f 1925, and could only be gradually \nremoved during the following months.”  \nForeign readers of these statements were \npresumably expected to conclude that, as \nsoon as the effect of these errors wore off, \nthe high price level and the dearth in com\xad\nmodities would also disappear. But in \nIzvesUa on April 5 appeared other signifi\xad\ncant admissions; “ In the first quarter of \nthe present year the cost of manufactured \ngoods to the peasants was augmented by \n11% per cent, as compared with a year \nago.”  Instead of the reduction of 5 per cent, \nin the cost of producing coal, which was \nordered by the Supreme Economic Council \nat the beginning of the campaign for price \nreduction, there has been an increase. The \nreduction o j 8 per cent, designated for iron \nore has turned out to he an actual increase \nin costs o f 10 per cent. Similar misfortunes \nhave been experienced in the metallurgical \nand chemical industries; and in others those \nreductions of costs which have been secured \nhave fallen short of the demands of the \nSupreme Economic Council, Americans in \nMoscow noted with humor—which to Mos- \ncovians perhaps seemed perverted—that the \nprice of rubber overshoes was reduced 15 \nper cent, as Winter came to an end and that \nbutter, eggs, milk and vegetables began to \nbe cheaper, as they usually do almost every\xad\nwhere in the world, with the approach of \nSpring. But the inhabitants of the Bolshe\xad\nvist capital could hardly dismiss as wry \nhumor the further observations of those \nAmericans who declared that much of the \nSoviet Government's difficulty in adjusting \nthe production of commodities and their dis\xad\ntribution at proper prices to meet the needs \nof the Russian people arises from igno\xad\nrance, inefficiency, laziness and corruption. \nLast Summer Stalin vehemently denounced \nthese weaknesses; the Government has ruth\xad\nlessly punished many offenders. But the \nState industries and bureaus and coopera\xad\ntives apparently still rival the stables of \nAugeas.\nThe report also contained the following \nstatistics;\nAGRICULTURE\nState enterprises.... 1,271,000,000 1,954,000,000\nCooperative enter\xad\nprises.................. . 72,000,000 146,000,000\nPrivate enterprises.. 8,316,000,000 14,956,000,000\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  9,659,000,000 17,056,000,000\nINDUSTRY\n1 Q 9 5 -1 Q 9 4  1 Q 9R -1Q 97\nState enterprises.... 4,093,000,000 9,794,000,000\nCooperative enter\xad\nprises . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  325,000,000 851,000,000\nPrivate enterprises,. 1,467,000,000 2,356,000,000\nTotal . . . . . ___. . . . .  5,885,000,000 13,001,000,000\nTOTAL PRODUCTION\n1QPR-1-Q94 192R-1927\nState enterprises.... 5,364,000,000 11,748,000,000 \nCooperative enter\xad\nprises 397,000,000 997,000,000\nPrivate enterprises,. 9,783,000,000 17,312,000,000\nTotal ..............15,544,000,000 30,057,000,000\nThese figures indicate that since 1923 the \npeasants—as private enterprisers—have \nlargely extended agriculture in the Soviet \nUnion, and that now in 1926-1927 they con\xad\ntrol more than 87 per cent, o f all agricul\xad\ntural undertakings. On the other hand, the \nstatistics show that the Government had \nthe preponderance in industry over private \ncompanies in 1923, and in 1926-1927 has an \neven greater proportion o f  industrial un\xad\ndertakings in its control—fully 75 per cent.\nThose who read these statistics were \nasked to see that the “ share of agriculture \nm the turnover o f commodities amounts to\n493\n", '494 CURRENT HISTORY, JUNE, 1927\nonly about 40 per cent, o f the total agricul\xad\ntural production; the remainder, being- con\xad\nsumed by the peasant population itself, does \nnot reach the open market,”  And, even \nthough the agricultural population still out\xad\nnumbers the industrial and continues to \ngrow proportionately larger, the framers of \nthe report would not have its readers un\xad\nderestimate the importance o f industry in \nthe economic life of Russia, "inasmuch as it \namounts at present to about 40 per cent, of \nthe total production and is constantly grow\xad\ning.”  But granting the importance of in\xad\ndustry in Russia and recognizing the tight \nhold which the Government has upon it, we \ncannot minimize the other significant facts \nin this report.\nDespite their lack o f organization and \nleadership, even though they have little or \nno voice in the Government, private persons \nin Russia—the peasantry and some urban \nfolk—produce more than. 67 per cent, o f the \nSoviet Union\'s commodities. And, in the \ncase of agriculture, they exercise an amount \nof control that has been, and still is, dis\xad\ntressing at times to the Soviet Government. \nThis very report admits that 60 per cent, o f  \nthe agricultural produce is consumed by the \npeasants themselves and never reaches "the \nopen market”  where the Government may \nget hold of it.\nThat the peasants not only outnumber \nthe urban population six to one but also \ncontrol the country\'s means of subsistence, \nis realized by high Soviet authorities, not\xad\nwithstanding their continual talk of com- \nmunizing agriculture in addition to indus\xad\ntry. But it ought to be equally clear to the \nSoviet leaders that the peasants have looked \nupon themselves as private property holders \never since they seized the royal lands dur\xad\ning the revolution. Judging from the re\xad\nports of his speeches in the past two years, \nStalin at least seems to understand that the \nfuture of Russia is largely in the hands of \nthe peasantry and that, i f  their needs are \nnot met and their wants appeased, there \nwill be grave dangers ahead for the Soviet \nrdgime. But the evidence is increasing that \nprice reduction By order of the Government \nis not the means for solving the vital prob\xad\nlem of supplying the peasantry with agri\xad\ncultural implements, manufactured goods \nand a desire to support the Soviet State.\nThe results of the census of 1926, as re\xad\nported to the Central Executive Committee \n<of the Soviet Union hy the head o f the Cen\xad\ntral Statistical Department, show that the \npopulation o f the Soviet Union is now 144,805,000,\nas compared with 135,600,000 in \n1914 for the same territory, Soviet Russia\nproper has 99,670,000 inhabitants, 69 per \ncent, of the total, the Ukraine 28,879,000, 20 \nper cent.; the Transcaucasian Federation of \nSocialist Soviet Republics 5,791,000, 4 per \ncent,; tbe \'White Russian Socialist Soviet \nRepublic 4,926,000, the Uzbek Republic and \nthe Tadjik Republic 4,562,000, the Turkoman \nRepublic 987,000. The census further re\xad\nveals that there has been an increase o f ur\xad\nban population. \'Whereas tbe census o f 1897 \nshowed that there were fourteen cities with \na population o f 100,000 or more, there are \nnow thirty cities with that population. The \ncensus of 1926 gives the population of Len\xad\ningrad as 1,611,103 and of Moscow as 2,018,-* \n286. The next largest city is Kiev, with 491,- \n333; then come Baku with 444,333, Odessa \nwith 411,111 and Kharkov with 407,578.\nThe American engineer, H. L. Cooper, con\xad\nfirmed tbe report that he had been engaged \nby the Soviet Government as consulting en\xad\ngineer for the design and construction of \nthe power project on the Dnieper River. He \nexplained the project as follows:\nThe worts will he built and financed by the \nSoviet Government and will cost approximately \n$70,000,000 and require about six years for their \nconstruction. Eventually 650,000 horsepower \nwill be installed in a  modern hydroelectric \nplant, and a flight of three locks, lifting craft \nby the 120-foot high dam, will make the Dnie\xad\nper River navigable from the Black Sea for a \ndistance of about 600 miles through this great \nUkraine coal, iron and wheat belt. The com\xad\npletion of this project will give Russia a  vast\nLITTLE RED RIDING HOOD IS GETTING- \nWISE.\n—Philadelphia, Inquirer\n', "RUSSIA 495\n■unit of hydroelectric energy at a cost -well be- ■ \nlow the average cost of hydroelectric energy \nin the United States and at the same time \nproduce low costs of transportation for imports \nand exports through Kherson and east of \nOdessa. Low cost of power’and navigation in \nthis immediate vicinity of vast undeveloped \nand partially developed resources will serve as \na great lever to promote and maintain a  large \nindustrial growth in industry and so help speed \nthe day when the cost of manufactured goods \ncan be greatly reduced.\nThe Soviet agency in Washington also \nannounced that C. E, Stuart, an American \npower expert, left in March for the Soviet \nUnion to make a study of the coal mines of \nthe Don basin and the possibility of install\xad\ning American machinery and coal mining \nmethods. Mr. Stuart said:\nI  made a two months’  visit to the Soviet \nUnion last year on the invitation of the execu\xad\ntive o f the Donugol ooal trust. I  found the \noutput per man considerably smaller than in \nthe United States, due to lack of mechanical \ndevelopment. Their engineers and administra\xad\ntive heads were eager for constructive criti\xad\ncism and determined to modernize their mines \nalong the lines of highest efficiency.\nOn April 10 the Congress o f the Russian \nSocialist Soviet Republic assembled in Mos\xad\ncow. Its 1,400 members were packed into \nthe State Opera House to listen to a memo\xad\nrial service for Dzherzinsky and Kras sin, \nprominent Soviet leaders who died during \nthe past year, to approve by a unanimous \nshow of hands the Praesidium which had \nalready been determined by the powers in \nthe Communist Party and then to hear the \nChief Commissar, Bykov, deliver a  set \nspeech which aroused no marked interest \nuntil he reached the Chinese issue. “ The \nChinese game,”  he declared, “win he won hy \nthe party with the strongest nerve, and Rus\xad\nsia, although able to intervene in China and \ntake reprisals, would not fall into the trap \nset hy England and the other imperialists.”  \nThe Soviet Foreign Office announced on \nApril 15 that an agreement had Been signed \non that day in Berlin to settle the differ\xad\nences between Switzerland and the Soviet \nUnion. The announcement stated that the \nSwiss Government had expressed regret for \nthe assassination of Vorovsky, the Soviet \nrepresentative at the Lausanne Conference \nin 1923 and provided compensation for Ms \nfamily and that negotiations would he \nopened as soon as possible with regard to \nall questions pending between the two coun\xad\ntries.

Bron of \nMoscow, head of the Russian delegation, de\xad\nlivered to the conference the message that \nit was not the intention of the Russian co\xad\noperatives to “ injure prices, Russia will sell \nat the world price and take her chances with' \nthe others,”  he said. “It will work out.”  \nMr. Bron estimated that Russia would he \nexporting 100,000,000 bushels of wheat in \nthe next two years.\nThe Soviet censor at Odessa returned a \ncopy of Current H istory for April to the \noffices of the magazine. No reason was \ngiven for its exclusion from Russia, hut pre\xad\nsumably the censor took exception to the \nreport which it contained of Kerensky's re\xad\nmarks to American newspaper men upon Ms \narrival in New York,\n"]</pre>
