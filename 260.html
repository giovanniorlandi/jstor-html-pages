        <pre>['“The obstacles to establishing a viable non-Communist South Vietnam in \nthe time that lies ahead are considerable . . . there is no anti-Communist— or \nnon-Communist— national political organization of any significance.”\nThe Many-Sided Politics of South Vietnam\nBy R ichard  Bu t w e l l\nBC1U-American University Program, The American University\nT\nhe concept of “two Vietnams” has \nbeen criticized by those who claim \nthat there is really only one Vietnam, \nhowever unfortunately (and temporarily) di\xad\nvided. Successive United States administra\xad\ntions have steadfastly maintained, on the other \nhand, that there are in fact “two Vietnams” \n—one of which (the North) attacked the \nother (the South). But there is still another \npoint of view: that there are several Vietnams.\nThe approaching end of the war between \nthe two conventionally conceived Vietnams \nwas signalled by President Lyndon B. John\xad\nson’s announcement of a halt to all bomb\xad\ning of North Vietnam on October 31, 1968, \nand by the preliminary peace talks involving \nthe United States and North Vietnam that \nbegan in Paris in May, 1968. It had long \nbeen realized that there could be no end to \nthe Vietnamese war without either the formal \nor tacit agreement of the United States and \nNorth Vietnam. Once these two parties had \nagreed to terminate their struggle, however, \nthe role of the local—that is, Southern—an\xad\ntagonists in the South Vietnamese political \nconflict assumed greater importance.\nSubsequently, the concept of the “two Viet\xad\nnams” may well undergo its severest test. In \none sense, there have been only two Vietnams \nfighting one another for the better part of the \nlast ten years. Only one anti-Communist\n1 Peter Braestrup (in The Washington Post of \nSeptember 8, 1968) estimated that less than half \nof the Vietnamese in the countryside—where 60 \nper cent of them reside—live under government \ncontrol.\nVietnam, the Saigon government (aided by \nthe United States and five other countries), \nhas been fighting the Communist Vietnamese, \ncomprised of the joint, if not combined, \nforces of the insurgent Vietcong—the military \narm of the National Liberation Front \n(N.L.F.)—and regular units of the North \nVietnamese armed forces.\nPolitically, however, there are many fac\xad\ntions, and this is where the concept of “two \nVietnams” breaks down. Within South Viet\xad\nnam itself there are two very important Viet\xad\nnams territorially—repeatedly recognized in \nthe claims of the extent of Saigon’s military \ncontrol. Throughout the decade, parts of \nSouth Vietnam have not been ruled by Sai\xad\ngon. In late 1968, the Thieu government \nclaimed control over nearly 70 per cent of \nSouth Vietnam, alleging that the Communists \n—that is, the National Liberation Front— \ncontrolled no more than 10 per cent of the \ncountry.1 This is probably an exaggeration. \nUnited States officials in Saigon admitted \nthat the N.L.F. had conducted elections of \nso-called “revolutionary committees” in \nnearly 1,250 villages and hamlets during 1968. \nAll of this clearly indicates the existence of \ntwo politico-territorial Vietnams within South \nVietnam.\nIt would be a gross oversimplification, how\xad\never, to recognize the existence of only these \nSouth Vietnams—the Saigon government and \nthe Communist National Liberation Front. \nSouth Vietnam is, unfortunately, even more \ndivided than this, although the other divisions\n71\n', '72 •  CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRUARY, 1969\ndo not generally possess territorial dimensions. \nThe problem of Vietnam for more than a \ndecade and a half has been the problem of \nmultipronged disunion and disaffection. The \nmilitary contest has been the arena for the \nforceful resolution of only the most important \nof these conflicts. The other struggles have \nordinarily not been fought on the battlefield.\nIn fact, there are many different groups \nthat struggle for power within what has come \nto be called South Vietnam, competing to fill \nthe vacuum created when Ho Chi Minh’s \nCommunist Viet Minh forced the withdrawal \nof the colonial French in 1954. Their ideas \nof what kind of Vietnam they want differ \ndramatically, as in the case of the conflicting \naspirations of some soldiers and most civilians, \nor many Buddhists and Catholics. In addi\xad\ntion, there are conflicts between Northerners \n(largely, but not exclusively, refugees from \nthe 1954 settlement) and Southerners, as well \nas among the Vietnamese and the non-Vietna\xad\nmese—the montagnards, or hill-people, and \nthe resident Chinese. Even within the mili\xad\ntary there have been major cleavages; while \ngroups such as the armed Cao Dai and Hoa \nHao religious sects have often sought aims \nincompatible with the aspirations of other \nVietnamese. The conflict between Commu\xad\nnist and non-Communist has frequently ob\xad\nscured these struggles, but they are impor\xad\ntant. There are Vietnamese—and some of \nthem are most ardently anti-Communist—■ \nwho still do not accept the legitimacy of any \nof the governments that followed the over\xad\nthrow and murder of President Ngo Dinh \nDiem in 1963.\nTHE N.L.F. STRATEGY\nThe strategy of the National Liberation \nFront has been “to hit with both fists while\n2 For a report of an interesting interview see \nAlessandro Casella, “The Militant Mood,” Far \nEastern Economic Review, May 16, 1968, p. 345.\n3 For a good analysis, see Charles W. Corddry’s \ndispatch from Saigon in the Baltimore Sun, October \n6, 1968.\n4 Stanley Karnow, in The Washington Post, Oc\xad\ntober 25, 1968.\n5 Ton That Thien, in Far Eastern Economic Re\xad\nview, May 30, 1968, p. 463.\n6 Stanley Karnow, in The Washington Post, No\xad\nvember 1, 1968.\nkeeping the emphasis on the political \nstruggle.” The insurrection against the Sai\xad\ngon government was begun in late 1959 only \n“because we were obliged to,” according to \nN.L.F. spokesmen, “since we had no chance \nof expressing our political views freely.”2 \nBy agreeing to the preliminary talks with the \nUnited States that began in May, 1968, North \nVietnam—but not necessarily the N.L.F.— \nseemed to be saying that it was time to re\xad\nemphasize the political and to deescalate the \nmilitary. North Vietnam was clearly not \nleading from military strength, but she was \nseeking to take advantage of apparently grow\xad\ning war-weariness and opposition in the \nUnited States.3 There were differences even \nin Hanoi regarding the wisdom of this choice,4 \nbut they were not so fundamental as those \nthat characterized the N.L.F. reaction to the \nNorth Vietnamese decision.\nNorth Vietnam apparently decided to \nlaunch its second major assault of the year \nto coincide with the start of the Paris talks \nin May. The Southern-led N.L.F. resented \nthe order for such military action, which was \npremature in the light of its lack of prepared\xad\nness. One of the top Vietcong military fig\xad\nures, the veteran and high-ranking Commu\xad\nnist Colonel Tam Ha, defected to the Saigon \ngovernment on the eve of the assault. Po\xad\nlitically, however, what annoyed the N.L.F. \nleadership most of all was the decision of the \nNorth Vietnamese to negotiate directly with \nWashington, thus ignoring the Front’s objec\xad\ntive of forcing the United States to deal di\xad\nrectly with the Vietcong as its primary mili\xad\ntary adversary and to treat the N.L.F. as the \nprincipal political party in any peace settle\xad\nment.5 The first reaction of the N.L.F. mis\xad\nsion in neighboring Cambodia to President \nJohnson’s October 31, 1968, bombing halt \nannouncement was one of obvious disappoint\xad\nment. Those N.L.F. representatives headed \nby Central Committee member Nguyen Van \nHieu were most displeased at the prospect of \nsitting at the same conference table with the \n“Thieu-Ky-Huong clique.”6\nThe N.L.F., however, clearly distinguishes \nbetween the leadership of the Saigon govern\xad\nment and many “patriots” within “the puppet\n', 'The Many-Sided Politics of South Vietnam  •  73\ngovernment, army, and administration.” A \n“patriot,” as the N.L.F. leaders see it, is any\xad\none who opposes the United States presence \nin Vietnam. N.L.F. leaders stated on the \neve of President Johnson’s bombing halt an\xad\nnouncement that they would not “make a \ndeal” with the “puppet” Saigon government \nbecause it was “only an instrument” of the \nUnited States. However, the N.L.F. would \ncooperate with “patriots”—even within the \nSaigon regime—in the formation of a govern\xad\nment of national union.7 Such a coalition, \naccording to Nguyen Van Heiu, the Front’s \nchief representative in Cambodia, would have \nto conform to the political program of the \nN.L.F. Any South Vietnamese government \nthat did not “satisfy the legitimate aspirations \nof the people” as reflected in the N.L.F. pro\xad\ngram, Hieu said, “would be overthrown.”8\nWhether the N.L.F. must lead, or even \nparticipate, in such a coalition is open to ques\xad\ntion. The Alliance of National, Democratic \nand Peace Forces which was formed earlier \nin the year could be used as an N.L.F. pres\xad\nence in any coalition government. The Alli\xad\nance for National, Democratic and Peace \nForces was first mentioned in Communist \nradio broadcasts at the time of the Tet \n(lunar New Year) offensive in late January, \n1968.\nThe Alliance’s leadership (if, indeed, it \nwas its real leadership) was drawn from \nneither conspicuously anti-Communist nor \npro-Communist sources. Professor Le Van \nHao, son-in-law of a businessman linked with \nthe economic interests of Mrs. Ngo Dinh Nhu \n—the well-known Madame Nhu of the Diem \nyears—was announced as chairman of the \nHue committee of the new political group. \nMrs. Truong Vy, mother-in-law of a general \nheading the South Vietnamese political war\xad\nfare department, and the Venerable Thich \nDon Hau, heir apparent to the controversial\n7 Alessandro Casella, in Far Eastern Economic \nReview, October 3, 1968, p. 9.\n8 Stanley Karnow, in The Washington Post, No\xad\nvember 8, 1968.\n* Beverly Deepe, in The Christian Science Moni\xad\ntor, May 8, 1968.\n10 The New York Times, August 29, 1968.\n11 Joseph B. Treaster, in The New York Times, \nNovember 16, 1968.\nmilitant monk Thich Tri Quang in Hue, were \nnamed deputy chairmen of the Hue commit\xad\ntee. Chairman of the national committee, \nwhich comprised primarily intellectuals and \nprofessionals rather than politicians, was \nlawyer Trinh Dinh Thao, married to the \ndaughter of one of Saigon’s richest jewellers \nbut also a one-time close friend of Nguyen \nHuu Tho, head of the N.L.F.9\nThe program of the Alliance of National, \nDemocratic and Peace Forces was a less stri\xad\ndent and more verbally conciliatory version \nof the 14-point N.L.F. program proclaimed \nin August, 1967. In particular, the program \nof tlie new grouping reflected far greater \nidentification with South Vietnam as a coun\xad\ntry distinct from North Vietnam than did \nthe earlier N.L.F. position. The August, \n1967, N.L.F. program referred to the “north\xad\nern part of our country” and described the \n“unity” of Vietnam as one of the underlying \nassumptions of the 1954 Geneva Accords.10 1\nThe Alliance for National, Democratic and \nPeace Forces, nonetheless, is clearly linked \nwith the N.L.F.—which presumably brought \nit into being to broaden its political appeal \nas well as possibly to use it as a disguised sub\xad\nstitute in any future coalition government.\nThat the N.L.F. is preparing for peace and \nthe reemphasis of the political aspect of the \nmulticomered struggle for ascendency in \nSouth Vietnam is clear. Beginning with the \nstart of the preliminary peace talks in Paris \nand continuing through President Johnson’s \nbombing halt announcement, Vietcong agents \nheld elections in 1,241 villages and hamlets \nin South Vietnam to bring into being a seem\xad\ningly representative quasi-governmental struc\xad\nture that would be entitled to participation \nin any future coalition arrangement. The \nVietcong claims control of 10 million of the \n17 million people in South Vietnam and \nfour-fifths of the total land area of the South \n—a claim clearly as exaggerated as Saigon’s \n—and to have established “revolutionary ad\xad\nministrations” in “almost all” of this territory. \nAccording to United States sources, however, \nsome kind of higher-level Vietcong organiza\xad\ntion was established in 17 provinces, 38 dis\xad\ntricts, and five cities.11\n', "74 •  CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRUARY, 1969\nSAIGON'S STRENGTH AND FEARS\nProbably the key reason the government of \nPresident Nguyen Van Thieu immediately \nbalked at participation in the expanded Paris \ntalks was its fear of setting a precedent for \nthe formation of a coalition government in\xad\ncluding the N.L.F.12 Thieu was not opposed \nto direct talks with North Vietnam, but he \ndid not want to strengthen in any way the \npolitical position of the N.L.F. in the South \nby according it even such legitimacy as might \nbe implied from participation in the Paris \ntalks. The Saigon government, like the \nN.L.F., was not at all happy with the way in \nwhich the United States and North Vietnam \nagreed to enlarge the discussions. The \nreason was the same in both cases: even such \na seemingly procedural decision could have \npolitical consequences.\nThe South Vietnamese attitude stemmed \npartly from a more modest appraisal of the \npolitical strength of the Saigon regime than \neither President Thieu or the United States \noffered publicly. In the year following the \n1967 elections, the Thieu regime had clearly \nstrengthened itself. It had come to be largely \ncomposed of native-born Southerners and \nwas as independent of military domination \nas any South Vietnamese government since \nthe overthrow of Diem. But apparently there \nwas, nonetheless, a feeling that the regime \nwas still not strong enough to battle directly \nwith the N.L.F. This lack of confidence \nunderlay Thieu’s reaction to President John\xad\nson’s October 31, 1968, announcement of ex\xad\npanded talks. Peace might be near, but \nThieu wondered whether his regime could \nsurvive.13\nPresident Thieu’s appointment in May, \n1968, of one of his leading presidential rivals \nof the previous year, Tran Van Huong, as \nPrime Minister, broadened the base and\n12 See Philip Potter, in The Baltimore Sun, No\xad\nvember 3, 1968.\n13 See Andrew Borowiec, in The Washington \nStar, October 27, 1968.\n14 See Chalmer Roberts’ account of North Viet\xad\nnam’s timing, in The Washington Post, November \n3, 1968.\n15 Donald Kirk, in The Washington Star, Octo\xad\nber 13, 1968.\nappeal of his regime, and aided him in his \ncontinuing contest for power with his more \nhawkish Vice President, Air Vice Marshal \nNguyen Cao Ky. K /s  position was also un\xad\ndercut by Thieu’s replacement of military \nofficers loyal to Ky and his dismissal of vari\xad\nous province and district chiefs appointed by \nKy when he was Prime Minister.\nIt was in the context of his struggle with \nKy and the latter’s supporters, mostly soldiers, \nthat Thieu asked General Duong Van Minh \nto come home. “Big Minh” had led the 1963 \ncoup against Diem and had later sought exile \nin Thailand. Thieu’s bid to “Big Minh” to \nreturn came at about the same time that \nNorth Vietnam was indicating to the United \nStates at Paris that Hanoi wanted to do busi\xad\nness with President Johnson while he was \nstill in office.14 Thieu’s action, accordingly, \nmust be considered not only within the con\xad\ntext of his struggle for power with Ky but \nalso in the framework of a possibly approach\xad\ning peace and Thieu’s realization of the need \nfor the greatest possible unity against the \nN.L.F. and the Alliance of National, Demo\xad\ncratic and Peace Forces. Two days after \n“Big Minh’s” return in October, President \nThieu placed the country’s armed forces on \nalert, apparently because of evidence that dis\xad\ngruntled elements within the military, possi\xad\nbly pro-Ky men, might use the recall of Minh \nto precipitate a crisis. However, there was \nno crisis.15\nThieu and Ky have been criticized in vari\xad\nous quarters abroad for jockeying for power \nat a time when the nation’s survival was at \nstake. The country’s precarious condition \ncould be invoked on Thieu’s behalf, however, \nto justify the need to end weakening rivalries \nwithin die government and to bolster the re\xad\ngime for the inevitable political battle with \nthe National Liberation Front. Besides seek\xad\ning to undercut Ky’s influence (partly because \nof his rival’s harder-line posture towards nego\xad\ntiations) , Thieu also sought to placate both \nBuddhist and Catholic leaders with at least \nsome success. Having earlier given official \nsupport to the more moderate Tam Chau \nBuddhist faction, Thieu tried to appease the \nmilitant Buddhist group of Thich Tri Quang\n", 'The Many-Sided Politics of South Vietnam  •  75\nby receiving some of its leaders. He \nappointed various politicians and officers who \nsupported the late Ngo Dinh Diem to posi\xad\ntions of influence and importance. As in the \ncase of his decision to name Tran Van Huong, \nthe respected former schoolteacher, to be \nPrime Minister, Thieu’s aim was strength \nthrough reconciliation. Too frequently, how\xad\never, he was not met even halfway.\nPresident Thieu’s July, 1968, release of \nThich Tri Quang and four other Buddhist \nmonks, detained “for their protection” since \nthe Tet offensive, brought applause even from \nsuch moderate Catholics as Father Hoang \nQuanh (chairman of the Council of Re\xad\nligions), but its effect was subsequently ne\xad\ngated by the re-arrest of Tri Quang who had \nfailed to show up at a National Salvation \nFront rally. Thieu was making an effort \nbut he, too, was have difficulty rising above \nclique-ridden Vietnamese politics.\nBUDDHISTS AND CATHOLICS\nThere has been no effective reconciliation \nbetween Buddhists and Catholics in the years \nsince the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem. \nPresident Thieu is more popular than Diem \nwith some Buddhists, but the more militant \nBuddhists still strongly oppose him. The \nmost militant Catholics are also in opposition, \nnot least of all because of his seemingly softer \nposture towards negotiations than that of \nother leaders. The militant Buddhists greeted \nthe approach of the Vietnamese New Year \nwith an urgent plea to the government to end \nthe war, a plea that was lost in the sudden \nexplosion of the Communist Tet assault. The \nBuddhist position strangely paralleled that \nof Thieu in the wake of President Johnson’s \nbombing halt announcement, expressing the \nfear that the United States would negotiate \na separate peace with Hanoi and that such a \npeace might betray “us Vietnamese who have \nbeen victims of this cruel struggle.” South \nVietnam’s 17 Roman Catholic bishops had \nearlier called for an end to the war, but a \nkey group of Catholic refugees from the \nNorth simultaneously pledged to fight any\n16 Nguyen Ngou R ao, in The Washington Post, \nO ctober 3, 1968.\ncoalition government that included the Com\xad\nmunists.\nBoth Buddhists and Catholics have been \ndivided over the question of negotiating with \nthe N.L.F. or joining in a coalition govern\xad\nment with the Communists. The Buddhists, \nhowever, have been at such odds with one an\xad\nother that they have effectively neutralized \nBuddhism as a political force in South Viet\xad\nnam. Seventy per cent of South Vietnam’s \n17 million people are Buddhists, and the two \nchief Buddhist factions—led by the militant \nThich Tri Quang and the moderate Thich \nTam Chau, respectively—have sought to \nattract followers partly in terms of the peace \nissue. The Tam Chau group, comprised to \na significant extent of anti-Communist Bud\xad\ndhist refugees who fled from the North fol\xad\nlowing the 1954- Geneva settlement, has been \ncalled a “tool” of the Thieu regime by the \nmilitants. The political importance of this \nBuddhist factionalization was indicated in \nAugust, 1968, when 40 deputies of the House \nof Representatives petitioned President Thieu \nto give legal recognition to the Tri Quang \ngroup (the Tam Chau organization had been \nendorsed by the government a year earlier \nas the sole legal Buddhist church). The Tam \nChau moderates have accused the militants \nof being pro-Communist, and one of the \nleading members of the Tri Quang faction, \nThich Don Hau, emerged in 1968 as one of \nthe two vice chairmen of the N.L.F.-formed \nAlliance of National, Democratic and Peace \nForces. The rivalry between the two Bud\xad\ndhist groups is no less keen than between \nBuddhists and Catholics in the old Diem days \nand hardly bodes well for the day when the \nwar ends and the united Communists con\xad\ntinue their campaign for conquest by political \nmeans.16\nft is probably not accurate to label the \nTam Chau Buddhists “hawkish”—particu\xad\nlarly in the light of their midyear call for \n“immediate” mutual deescalation—but they \nare certainly harder-line than the Tri Quang \ngroup, which might even be called “neutral\xad\nist” in the conflict with the Communists. It \nis perhaps not surprising that a harder line \namong both Buddhists and Catholics is gen\xad\n', '76 •  CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRUARY, 1969\nerally taken by those who fled the North in \n1945-1955. The chairman of the Council of \nReligions, Father Hoang Quanh, however, \nwas an outspoken advocate of direct negotia\xad\ntions with the N.L.F., despite his Northern \norigin. Most Catholics in 1968, on the other \nhand, were probably still committed to the \ncomplete defeat of the Vietcong on the battle\xad\nfield before talks—the call for the war’s end \nby their bishops notwithstanding. The Catho\xad\nlics, like the Buddhists, are not the monolithic \ngroup that is sometimes suggested. Roman \nCatholics are represented in the legislature \nout of proportion to their numbers in the \nwhole population—they represent 11 per cent \nof the Vietnamese people. But they are by \nno means a cohesive group on this and other \nquestions. Buddhists and Catholics remain \nlargely opposed to one another—and they are \nfar more divided now than they were in 1963, \nthe year of Diem’s death.\nTHE DECISIVE COUNTRYSIDE\nThe Tet offensive at the start of 1968 had \nthe effect of drawing soldiers, police, civil \nservants and revolutionary development teams \nalike into the district and provincial capitals. \nThey returned to the rural areas only very \nslowly. Six months after the Communists’ \nNew Year’s assault, local officials dared spend \nthe night in only one-third of the hamlets \ncategorized as “relatively secure.” The effects \nof the Tet attacks on the long slow-moving \npacification effort were extremely damaging. \nAmerican and Vietnamese development ac\xad\ntivity was largely converted into reconstruc\xad\ntion work.17\nA good part of President Thieu’s effort \nsince the Tet campaign has been devoted to \nimproving the cumbersome and complex \nVietnamese governmental apparatus — not \nleast of all to rooting out corruption, which \nhas been no less an enemy than the Vietcong. \nThieu removed 17 province chiefs, fired \ndozens of district leaders, and replaced hun\xad\n17 See Peter Braestrup, in The Washington Post, \nSeptember 8, 1968.\n18 See Ibid.\n19 Lee Lescaze, in The Washington Post, July 1, \n1968.\ndreds of lesser officials, large numbers of them \non charges of corruption. On the other hand, \nthe popular and legitimate qualities that many \nexpected local government to develop after \nthe 1967 elections have not evolved. Large \nnumbers of village and hamlet committees \nelected in 1967 no longer function for a \nvariety of reasons, including security.18\nPartly out of necessity and partly for rea\xad\nsons of strategy, however, the Vietcong is \nlargely concentrating its political effort today \nin the rural areas. A percentage of the rural \npeasantry, larger than the Saigon government \nis willing to admit, still lives under govern\xad\nment rule by day but with the Communists \npresent at night. Less than one-third of the \ncountry’s police are deployed today at the \ndistrict level or below. Non-governmental \norganizations, moreover, are even less effec\xad\ntive than the official structure. The Bud\xad\ndhist church, for example, is much weaker in \nthe countryside because of its split on the na\xad\ntional level.\nThe obstacles to establishing a viable non- \nCommunist South Vietnam in the time that \nlies ahead are considerable. But perhaps the \nmost important of these are the divisions that \nstill afflict the land. There is no nationwide \npro-government counterpart either to the \nN.L.F. or to the more recently formed Alli\xad\nance for National, Democratic and Peace \nForces. In June, 1968, President Thieu called \n“political parties” the country’s “infrastruc\xad\nture,” while “the government, including both \nexecutive and legislature, is only its super\xad\nstructure.”19 The fact is, however, that there \n( Continued on page 112)\nRichard Butwell has lived in Burma and the \nPhilippines.

I t is possible that dissatisfaction \nat the price the government agency is will\xad\ning to pay for rice compared to the financial \ngain to be made from smuggling across the \nSouth Vietnamese borders is of significance. \nIt may also be true that in some regions \npeasants and townsfolk have been increas\xad\ningly resentful of the government-sponsored \nvoluntary manual labour programs, which \nsmack too much of corvie, and the constant \nappeals for financial contributions for Sang\xad\nkum projects, even though these are for pub\xad\nlic benefit. Finally, there may well be a \ngrowing reaction against the well-publicized \npractice of corruption in government and \npublic service circles; this has been especially \nemphasized in leftist literature.\nPrince Sihanouk has sought to counter the \narguments of those who do not see any for\xad\neign hand in the Cambodian uprisings.15 \nThe Prince has gone to great lengths to ex\xad\nplain the absence of peasant grievance, and \nthe role of Viet Minh zones along the Cor- \ndamome ranges, noting that the alleged peas\xad\nant rebellion occurred just where the Viet \nMinh had placed its cells and arms caches.16\nIt would be profitable, at this juncture, to \nlook at another and more concrete case of \ndissidence. In Ratanakiri province in the \nnortheast, the Cambodian government has \nclaimed that the various hill tribes,17 equipped \nwith excellent weapons, are in fact secession\xad\nists in foreign pay.18 19 In the general region of \nthe northeast there b the likelihood of out\xad\nside and irredentist intervention; for example, \nin the Lao-peopled Siampang region of Stung \nTreng province. However, Prince Sihanouk \nhimself offered a convincing explanation for \nthe roots of dissidence in Ratanakiri, noting \nthat the montagnard population seemed to be \nless interested in ideological struggles than in \nisolation.
