In\nfront of him was an open wife.\n"It\'s gone!" he said.\nLewis was shaking as if stricken\nwith ague. "What do you make of it?"\nhe stammered.\n"I tell you what I make of it! " shout\ned Bramwell. "The Neatfoot company\nhas stolen the plans for our new en\ngine. It means a difference of about\ntwelve million dollars. They\'ve been\nafter it for a year.

The separator\nmethod gets 25 per cent more\ncream from the milk and this\nwill pay for a separator in a\nyear in a dairy nerd oi ten or\nmore cows. As the cream is\nseparated while fresh and sweet.\nripening can be controlled and\nbutter of much better grade can\nbe secured than if the cream is\nraised by gravity. The use of a\nseparator lightens the work for\nthe housewife. The machine is\nkept in a small room adjoining\nthe barn and only the separator\nparts are brought from the\nhouse.

"I have an Investment," John had\nlaughed.\nAnd his words came back to her as\nshe sat within the office, near John.\nOnce she raised her eyes and looked\nat him steadfastly. His own eyes had\nbeen fixed Bcrutlnizlngly on hers. He\ndropped them.\nLater that day he told her some\nthing that amazed her. His Invest\nment had been of a little legacy a\nfew hundred dollars only, but a tip\nfrom a broker had enabled him to real\nize Ave thousand on it. He had the\nmoney safe In the bank. Would she\nmarry him now?\nAnd the girl\'s eager joy was damp\nened by the sudden fearful suspicion\nthat came to her. She thrust it aside\nbut it returned. John a thief?

The new\nman, Fallon, a surly, vindictive-look\'\nlng fellow, had his post opposite the\nwindow facing Nancy\'s desk. When-\never she looked up she would see Fal\nIon\'s eyes fixed on hers. He seemed\nto be watching ber. And it was not\nlong before she began to see Fallon\nlurking behind her when she went out\nto lunch, when she went home. The\nman was a spy.

The Impression\nhad grown into certainty. The story\nof the legacy was preposterous. In\nNancy\'s brain an Idea was born.

There\nwas a look of satisfaction on his dark\nface. He followed her to the office\nalmost openly.\nTwice more Nancy performed thlg\nfeat Each time she saw Fallon be\nhind her. And somehow, in the mys\nterious way of offices, that story got\nknown too. Nancy read it in the faces\nof all the girls, in John\'s.

"You know Mr. FegglB will\nbe back today and before he comes "\nhis voice was soft as honey "I think\nyou had better confess that you Btole\nthat plan of the engine."\nThey waited, watching her face like\nhawks.\n"We\'ve got the goods on you," shout\ned Lewis theatrically. "You\'d better\nconfess. You have been tracked to\nthe Neatfoot offices."\n"Yes, I confess," said Nancy calmly.\n"I was bribed to steal that engine\nplan."\nBefore the triumph on their faces\nhad risen to the full the door opened\nand John came hurrying in.\n"You can cut that out!" he shout\ned. "I stole the engine plans, and I\nwarn you that all the office is talking\nabout Miss Graham being Implicated.\nWell, it\'s a lie. I\'m responsible."\nThe look of triumph turned to\namazement Then Lewis leaped for\nward. "You both stole them!" he shouted.\n"I have suspected you from the be\nginning. This will be a jail Ben\ntence "\n"Dear me, what will be a Jail sen\ntence? What Is this trouble about?"\ndemanded a pleasant-voiced old gentle\nman, entering the office, umbrella in\nhand.\n"Mr. Feggls!" exclaimed Bramwell.\n"Sir, the engine plans have been\nstolen, sold to the Neatfoot company,\nand these persons are the guilty ones.\nThev took the nlans from the safe "\n"tflBt are you talking aboutr de\nmanded Feggls. "Didn\'t the messen\nger deliver that note I sent you from\non board the Aquitalne? Why, my\ndear fellow, I took the plans.

"Why, Nancy, what on earth\ndidn\'t you believe in that legacy?\nI tell you what, doar, we\'ve both beon\noverworked and got a little nerve\nworn. What do you aay to starting\nthat honeymoon tomorrow ?"\n"Tomorrow?" Nancy gasped.

He was telling her ot an en\ncounter In a dark side street the eve\nning before with three sinister China\nmen. They had backed another yel-low-hued\ncountryman against a brick\nwall. One of the assailants held bis\nthroat in a talon-like clutch. A sec\nond had Imprisoned his arms.

"See, Aunt Lydla the\nbeautiful pin Mr Prescott has given\nme!"\n"You are spoiling the child, Mr.\nPrescott," spoke Miss Ward, but with\nan indulgent smile.\nHe did not reply, but his eyes met\nher own with a rapt, longing expres\nsion. She read its meaning love\nnot only for the little one, but for her\nself as well. He seemed about to\nspeak. The memory of what had fol\nlowed an offer of marriage caused\nPrescott to control his deep emotion.\nSoon he loft the house.\nIt was hard to be about dally in the\ncompany ot the woman he so devoted\nly loved and refrain from urging her\nto reconsider her decision. It had been\nannounced in a kindly way, so consid\nerately, in fact, that Prescott half be\nlieved that but for circumstances\nLydla might have favored his plea.\nAn orphan herself, her life was\nwrapped up In little Flora, who, hav\ning lost both father and mother, was\ncherished by Lydla as a responsibility\nto whom she had devoted her life. This\nmuch she had told Prescott In answer\nto his offer of marriage.\nThere was another suitor Leslie\nShaw. Prescott had never liked him.\nHe was persistent in his attention\nto Lydla. He was a man about town,\nwith unknown antecedents. Prescott\nhad experienced relief and satisfaction\nwhen a servant of the house, with\nwhom he was a favorite, told him of\nthe summary dismissal of his rival.\nIt seemed that Shaw had impor\ntuned Lydla to accept him as her hus\nband. She had given him the same\nanswer that Prescott had received:\nHer lite was bound up in little Flora.\nThe etirnged Shaw had fiercely wished\nthe little one was dead, bad let loose\nhis wicked temper in a way that\nshocked and disgusted Lydla. Then\nShaw had sworn that ho would yet\nwin her as his wife, if it took him\nten years to accomplish his purpose,\nand hud gone away In a tempest of\nwrath,\nLyilia never Rave nny token of that\nstormy interview, but Prescott was\nwell satisfied that she bad a contempt\nfor Shaw. She feared nlm, too, Pres\ncott believed, and, while he was glad\nthat a persistent rival was out ot the\nway, he kept himself on the alert to\nguard against any attempt to annoy\nLydla on the part of Shaw.\nOne evening the telephone bell in\nbis room rang sharply. His name was\npoken breathlessly, and he thrilled\nand tingled as he recognized the tones\nof the woman he loved.\n"Is it Mr. Prescott?" she asked in\ntone that trembled.\n"Yes, Miss Ward."\n"Will you please come to the house\nat once oh, at once, please!" and\nPrescott dashed from the room, trac\ning anxiety and urgency in the wel\ncome summons that might mean some\nthing helpful for Lydla\nHe found her distractedly pacing\nthe floor when he arrived at her home.\nShe was white to the lips and her\neyes bore the traces of a poorly sup\npressed anguish.\n"Flora!" she gasped. "She Is gone!"\n"Gone? You mean" began Pres\ncott in alarm.\n"Stolen, kidnaped, spirited away!\nShe was alone in the garden for an\nhour playing with her dolls," narrated\nLydla. "When I went to call her in\nshe had disappeared.\n"But kidnaped? Impossible!" cried\nPrescott. "She must have wandered\naway.\n"I found this note on a garden\nseat," proceeded Lydla. "Read It.\nThe crumpled scrawl was signed\nwith one name Shaw and it ran:\n\'You will hear from me shortly. Un\nless you agree to marry me you will\nnever see little Flora again."\nThe scoundrel!" cried Prescott.\n\'I will set the police on his track at\nonce.\n"No! no!" implored Lydla. "You\ndo not know this man Shaw. If any\nsuch an attempt Is made, he will dis\nappear, and Flora with him. Oh, try\nand find her! Try and bring me back\nmy lost darling!"\nAlvin Prescott had a difficult task\nbefore him. Shaw was not to be found\nat any of his occasioned haunts. No\ntrace was discovered ot the missing\nchild. The grief of Lydia was pitiable.\nPrescott devoted all his time to the\nmission in hand, but it was of no\navail.\nIt was the fifth morning after the\ndisappearance of Flora, that, walking\nalong the otreet, he observed a squat\noriental figure speed across the thor\noughfare to his side. It was Wang Fo.\n"I find you!" he cried in extrava\ngant Joy. "The pin of the golden\nbantam. You lose?"\n"No, I gave It to a child"\n"I have found her. You come come,\nquick!"\nWith faint heart of hope Prescott\naccompanied the half coherent, but In\ntensely excited Wang Fo. He led him\nto the Chinese quarter of the city,\nand through sinuous and mysterious\npassages into what seemed to be a.\nsecret lodge room.\nThere, on a dais, surrounded by\nChinese women, was Flora. She was\nsupremely contented, for they had\nglYen h.er all kinds of quaint toys and\nteemed only bent on entertaining her,\nWang Fo told his Btory.

IT.\nThat the elimination of com\npetition, the reduction of ex\npense and the promotion of hy\ngenic conditions in women\'s\nclothing depends upon the adop\ntion of a standardized dress for\nwomen, is the idea followed by\nthe department of home eco\nnomics of the University of Mis\nsouri at Columbia in devising a\nstandardized garment. The\nnew dress is intended for all\nwomen on all occasions, varia\ntions coming only in fabric and\ncolor.\nThe present style of woman\'s\ndress, on a competitive basis,\nproduces an enormous annual\nwaste, both by frequent changes\nand added material, says Miss\nEthel Ronzone, who designed the\nstandardized dress. Women\nspend much time not only in se\nlecting garments but in making\nover those that are no longer ap\npropriate on account of changes\nin popular stvle. Dress is\nclothing classes has made one or\nmore of the standardized dress\nes and many of the girls and all\nof the instructors wear them.

All surolus\nrugs, draperies and furnishings\nshould be removed. This gives\nmore space and makes disinfec\ntion easier after the sickness is\nover.\nAll cases of sickness, includ\ning pneumonia and catarrhal in\nfections, do best in a cool, well\nventilated room. Ventilation\nwithout draft should be provid\ned for by means of window\nboards or similar devices to\nthrow the air up toward the ceiling.\nThe patient should be kept\nclean and quiet. A single thin\ngarment, such as nightgown or\nnightshirt, is all that is needed.\nThe bundling up of sick persons\nwith plasters, rags and woolens\nis bad from every standpoint.\nPatients should not be annoy\ned by having to ask for every\nthing. At the same time, they\nshould not be asked every few\nminutes whether thev wish\nsomething. The nurse, guided\nby the physician, should know\nwhat the patient needs and sup\nply it at the proper time.\nVisiting is. as a rule, to be ta\nbooed. When conversation is\nnecessary, it should be in a mod\nerate tone of voice without ex\ncitement. Whispering is gen\nerally worse than loud talking.\nFood, prepared well and dainty,\nshould be brought to the patient\nat the necessary time. The pa\ntient should not be asked what\nhe wishes to eat.\nThe sick person should not be\nannoyed by hard-luck stories,\neither the personal experience of\nthe nurse or of the neighbors.\nThe nurse should invariably\nobey the instructions of the phy\nsician. If the disease is one in which\nthe sputum carries the conta\ngion, the sputum should be\npromptly disinfected by burning\nif possible. Handkerchiefs\nshould either be burned at once\nor dropped into boiling water. All\ndiseases are more contagious by\ndirect contact than otherwise.\nThe nurse should always remem\nber the danger of spreading the\ninfection to other persons and\nendeavor to prevent it.

Much time and\nenergy may be wasted by the\nbees making comb that could be\nused profitably in making honey.\nLosses from starvation may be\nprevented by feeding the colony\nextracted honey or sugar syrup\nwith a division board feeder.\nColonies of bees which do not\nhave sufficient winter stores in\nthe brood chamber, should be fed\nin the fall before cold weather\nsets in. In the spring, when the\ncolony begins to rear its brood or\nyoung bees, it needs as food both\nfconey and pollen or a substi\ntutes for pollen. Rye flour in a\nbox on some clean, bright hay in\na sunny place will supply bees\nwith a substitute for pollen until\nnature furnishes flowers for\nthem to work on. This will help\nprevent spring dwindling.\nIn a bulletin on "Farm Bee\nKeeping\' recently issued by Pro\nfessor Ilaseman and E. E. Tyler,\nan experienced bee-keeper, the\nI authors show that the product\nj ion of wax is an expensive and\n; wasteful operation. The wax is\n\' secreted by the worker bees, and\n\', they will eat about fifteen or\n1 twenty pounds of honey to secret\njone pound of wax and work it\nj into comb. Artificial comb foun\ndation should always be put in\n-frames and sections as starters,\nand for the greatest honey yield\nfoundation and an extractor\nthrowing the honey out of the\ncombs and then return the un\ninjured combs to the hive for re\nfilling. Anyone using comb\nfoundation and an extractor or\nmore than doubles the ability of\nhis bee colony.\nButtonholes That Last.\n"If well made, a buttonhole\nshould wear as long as the gar\nment," says Miss Addie D. Root\nof the Missouri College of Agri\nculture. "There is no excuse\nfor the buttonhole that soon\nbreaks through at the end and\nleaves a slit twice as great as the\ndiameter of the button"\nTo make a good buttonhole, be\ngin the slit about a quarter of an\ninch in from the edge. Cut on a\nthread through both or all\nthickness of the cloth, making\nthe slit the length of the diam\neter of the button to be used.\nUse a thread a little heavier than\nthe cloth in which the buttonhole\nis worked and of sufficient length\nto complete it. The needle\nshould be as fine as will carry\nthe thread.\nIn working a buttonhole, first\nput in two or more stitches\nacross the lower end of the slit\nto keep it from stretching. Then\ntake two or more stitches down\nthe side, across the end and up\nthe other side, a sixteenth of an\ninch from the edge, bringing the\nneedle out at the starting point.\nThis will strengthen the button\nhole. In overcasting the edges,\nsink the stitch a thread beyond\nthis stranding. Four or five\novercasting stitches on each\nside are sufficient to prevent\nraveling and to keep the strands\nin place. The last stitch in over\ncasting should bring the needle\nout at the end of the slit ready\nto begin working the buttonhole.\nIn taking the buttonhole stitch,\nthe needle should be brought\nthrough towards the worker,\ndeep enough to cover all stitches\nthat have been made before and\nprevent pulling out. Before puli\nng through, make the buttonhole\npurl by taking the thread over\nthe eye of the needle and carry\ning it around the point of the\nneedle in the direction in which\nyou are sewing. When the end\nis reached, take seven or nine\nspreading stitches, making a\nfan, if a rounded end is desired.\nContinue down the other side.\nIf a bar is used, put the needle\ninto the opposite purl at the end\nof the slit, draw the two sides\ntogether and make several long\nstitches the length of the width\nthat the buttonhole is cut. Work\nthe bar across the end, working\nfrom left to right with the blan\nket stitch. Finish by taking a\nfew tiny stitches on the wrong\nside.\nCOMETOKANSASCITYAT\nOUR EXPENSE\nThere was never a better time to visit Kansas City than\nnext week, when Jones\' pays your Round Trip Railroad fare\non the basis of 5 of your purchases in order that you may\ncome and share on an equal footing with all Kansas Citians\nin the wonderful Bargains in our\nANNUAL FEBRUARY FURNITURE SALE\nWe\'ve provided marvelously for this sale nearly 100\nCarloads of Furniture will be on Sale.\nSpecial Factory Clean-ups\nGrand Rapids Exhibit Samples\nFactory Leaders\nOwing to the great volume of business done in our Feb\nruary Furniture Sale, Factories sought our business, and\nmade big reductions, in spite of raising prices on all mater\nials.
