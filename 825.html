It\nwas thought, some three or four\nweeks ago, that the ghost has\nbeen laid for good, or at least, for\nthis session but this particular\nspeck appears to possess some of\nthe resilience of Mr. Ranque\'s\nhistoric wraith and refuses to down\nIt was said at the time that the\nprohibition people for whom Con\ngressman Richmond Pearson Hob\nson in the spokesman were con\ntent to let the matter rest for the\npresent anti the proposed amend\nment to the constitution of the\nUnited States providing for the\nnational prohibition would repose\nserenely in the rules committee\nuntil after election. But some\nbody up arid threw a monkey\nw T renee into the machinery, the\nsaid pestiferous somebody being a\nresolution asking that the rules\ncommittee proceed forthwith to\nreport out a special rule for tlie\nconsideration of the prohibition\nresolution. At that moment Mr.\nCantrell\'s popularity suffered a\nsudden and violent decline. Some\nof his best friends looked upon\nhim sorrowfully as he passed a\nmong them and these who were\nnot well acquainted with him I\nmade no particular effort to im\nprove their acquaintanceship. ;\nIt might not be inappropes toj\nreview somewhat, ttie inciuents\nwhich have led up to the present\ntremulous state of congressional\nmind in relation to this prohibi\ntion question. Several mouths\nago, Congressman Hobson, the i\nsame who sank the Merriuiae and j\nwas, in turn, very recently sunk\nby Oscar W. Underwood intro\nduced a joint resolution provid\ning for the submission to the\nStates ot an amendment fo the\nconstitution of the United States\nto prohibit the manufacture, dis\ntribution and sale of intoxicants\nof every sort, shade, variety and\nmixture. To be successful, this\nresolution would have to pass both\nthe house anti senate by two-thirds\nmajority and then be affirmatively\nacted Oupon by three-fourths of\nthe forty-eight states of the na\ntion. When one considers that\nit required a fight of twenty years\nto secure the income lax amend\nment to the constitution and an\neven longer peroid of time for the\ncons uniat ion of the efforts of the\nadvocates of the direct election of\nsenators it is not difficult to tigure\nout that even though the resolu\ntion should pass both houses a\ndoubtful assumption this prohibi\ntion amendment would have a\nlong fight ahead of it.\nThe resolution was sent to the\nJudicialy Committee of the house\nwhere, ill the usual order of things\nit would be duly chloroformed.\nBut the pressure on the individual\nmembers of the Judiciary Com\nmittee became too strong and,\nwith tlie view of saving their po\nlitical bacons and of throwing\nsome of the responsibility for the\nbill\'s death on their brother mem\nbers, the Judiciary Committee u\nf^w weeks ago, reported the reso\nlution back to ttie bouse without\nany recommendations. As stated\nin a former letter there was much\nhurrying and skurrying thither\nand yonuer by the four hundred\nthirty-five members of the house\nin au effort to head off a record\nvote on the measure. Each and\nevery one of these four hundred\nthirty-five realized on the instant\nthe thing was loaded at both ends\nand set with a hair trigger. The\nrepublicans whose one thought of\ntheir present dreary existence is\nput tin* democrats in a cavity eag\nerly joined with their erstwhile\nenemies in proposing ways and\nmeans of throttling the thing with\nthe least possible publicity. The\nprogressives who pretend to fear\nnothing exeept it be the frown of\nthe River Doubtful went about\nfrantically whispering that some\nthing ought to he done.\nAt this juncture Captain Hob\nson and some of his advisors, aft* r\nsizing up the situation and tiger\ning that they stood a good chance\not being licked anyway, let it be\ncome known that it would not\npress consideration of the bill j\nwhereat Captain Hobson became I\nan immensely popular member of |\nthis body. Man who had been in !\ndined to pok^ a bit of fun at the j\nhero of Santiago Bay retracted all J\nof the things they had ever said !\nab nit him and cheerfully proclaim -\ned that after all Captain Hobson\nis a mighty tine gentleman- It\nw\'as then that the anti-prohibition j\nists, the \' wets" as they are some j\ntimes referred to commenced to j\nget busy. They reasoned that |\nhere and now would be as good a 1\nplace and time us any to bury this\n■7 x .7 l * 1 1 O\nprohibition business beneath an\navalanche of votes. r J,\'liey began\nto insist upon immediate action\nf4ll< ^ ^ l * s insistence finally culmin\nrt t e d in the Oautrill resolution pro\n\\ itiiug tor a special rule.

He was\nspeaking on the treatment of Greek\nsubjects in Turkey.\n1 he premier\'s attitude showed that\nthe tension between Greece and Tur\nkey is near the breaking point and\nthat the danger of war is imminent.\nThe premier obviously found diffi\neulty in restraining his language\nwhen he spoke of the way in which\nthe Turks have treated his country\nmen. He said:\n"I do not wish to allow to escape\nwords which cannot be recalled, but\n1 should fail in my duty it\' I did not\ninform the chamber of deputies that\nthe situation has become grave—even\nvery grave.\nIf a stop is not put to these con\nditions the Hellenic government will\nhe forced not to content itself with\njoining in the lamentations of un- [\nhappy refugees."\nThe Greek government sent a vig- \\\norous note to Turkey demanding ces\nsation of the persecution of the ,\nGreeks in Turkey and the repair of !\ndamage caused to them and their in\nterests.\nCALIFORNIA VOLCANO ACTIVE\nTerrific Outburst Occurs From Mount\nLassen.\nRedding, Cal., Juno /J.

Inured to exposure\nhardship, and endowed by nature wltfafl\na splendid physique, which his simpte -1\nhabits have never abused, tbe aged*\'\nmonarch, after catching cold in Marcft^\nat first rather neglected the warnings\nof his faithful old physician, Dr. KerzL\nIf ho lives he will be eighty-four In;\nAugust, but he still has the strength\'\nand vitality of many a younger man.\nLast summer at Ischl, clad in a blouse,\nwith bare knees, he several times was\nsoaked to the skin while hunting, with\nout suffering from it. It was very\nhard to make him understand that at\nhis age a case of combined catarrh and\nbronchitis may easily terminate fatally\nunless every precaution is taken.\nThe Austro-I Iungarians are very fond\nof their alter herr (old gentleman), as\nthey affectionately speak of him, and\nthe Viennese especially idolize him.\nThat could be seen throughout this\nwhole period of his illness. On days\nEMPEROR FRANCIS JOSEPH.\nwhen it was reported that he was in\nparticular danger large crowds throng\ned the immense open square in front\nof the castle. Reverently, patiently,\nlongingly, they stood for hours and\nhours in the pattering rain and keen\nblasts that sweep down from the near\nby mountains, whispering to each other\nand exchanging words of hope or ap\nprehension.\nWhen the weather improved for the\nmoment their beloved ruler would now\nand then appear at a certain window.\nThen there would be cheering and\nthrowing of hats in the air, and "God\nbless and keep you\'\' would be mur\nmured all around. After that thou\nsands in the multitude would disperse\nand contentedly walk away, many of\nthem to homes far away. Others,\nthough, would wait til! midnight\nwatching, inquiring, fearing.\nSince the emperor\'s illness began gay\nVienna has been in half mourning, and\nthe whole monarchy is waiting with\nbated breath for news of him. In the\nbrilliantly lighted coffee houses dowu\ntown the conversation is of him. All\npublic and representative bodies, from\nthe two "delegations" now in session\nin Budapest down to the provincial ad\nministrative chambers, the municipal\ncouncils and commercial syndicates\nand boards of stockholders, have\nadopted resolutions of sympathy and\nwishes for the emperor\'s speedy recov\nery.\nFrancis Joseph lias never made\nfriends with some of the modern in\nventions, such as the long distance tel\nephone, and his fixed idea is that to\nleave Sclioenbrunn and Vienna for an\nindefinite period, especially when both\ninternal and foreign politics demand\nhis full attention, would be tantamount\nto giving up the throne.', '♦SMimesitisisiessieissxsxKMssss*\n| ...
