This is supposed to be pretty\nwell understood\' at Honolulu, on\nMaui and Hawaii, so that all the\ncommittee will likely have to do\nwill be to present their application\n-itftd it will 1)0 forthwith granted.\nThere was some discussion as to\n, the probable number likely to at-\naddressed the Chamber at so t-e\nlentgh, outlining: what some of his\npolicies would be.

The delegates to\nthe convention were cautioned to\n- get a line on tjiis particular for\nfuture reference.\nKauai is assigned two, set\nspeeches at the Maui convention,\nthe one being on the subject of\n"Co-operation" and the other\non "Kauai". Rev. I M. Lydgate\nwas appointed to handle the form\ner and Senator E: A. K\'.iudsen the\nlatter.\nThe Inter-Island S. N.

In the city, the\n. Kauai delegates will join the dele\nigations from the commercial\norganizations there and proceed,\nthe same afternoon, in the Mauna\nLoa, t6 Kahului.

Wsuluku and\nMaui Agricultural Co, will result in less earnings for these properties,\ncomparatively speaking, as but a relatively small portion of this year\'s\ncrop remained unsold August 1, when high pi ices were inaugurated.\nThese plantations, however, will get 1915 crop sugars in the market by\nDecember I, and should the present high level of sugar prices continue\nfor a six months period only, will greatly benefit thereby.\nFew of the plantations had averaged much over ?3.10 per hundred\nor S62 per ton from sales of this year\'s outturn t August 1 , and the\nlgcncies in making estimates had generally accepted S3 25 per hundred\nor $65 as the average price of the entire 1914 crop.. Consider for a\nmoment what an average of only $65 per ton means to the few planta\ntion in which you are interested. You are likely to be further impres\nsed with the beneficial effects of this epoch-making conflict of the great\nPowers of Europe: it has saved many a plantation in Hawaii from re\ngistering a substantial loss on th:s year s operations, and will permit\nall to rehabilitate their finances.\nHIGH SUGAR PRICES.\nThe probable duration of high sugar price i is the cjucstion most of\nus are cndeavoiing to intelligently answer. Mere corjecture is about\nthe onlv method open at present, in view of the possi! le sudden deve\nlopments offered by war conditions.\nSome little knowledge of the world\'s sugar situation may help in\nforming an opinion.\nEngland consumes an enormous quantity of sugar, every pound of\nwhich, had been imported hcret fore, principally from Germany and\nRussia and from certain tropical dependencies. The European supply\nis now eliminated, the result being thai England h:.s er.\'.i.rtd the Cu\nban market as a competitor of the American refiner Th\'is nieums\nhigher price, and is just what is creating the present high level of raw\nnotations!\' particularly the spectacular rise ot the jwst b.w wicks.\nThe situation in the sugar market resolves itself into two separate\nand distinct factors the United States and England as competitors for\nthe sugars of Cuba, Java and other tropical countries, on one hand,\nr.nd all the warring factions of continental Europe, who will probably\nbe able to take care of their individual demands, according to sugar\nsatisticians, bv working women and children in the fields, on the other\nhand,\nIn any event, the Iuiropean production has ceased to be a factor\nin determining the price we will receive for our output, and the\nworld\'s market price for all pnieticnl purposes will hereafter 1 e the\nNew York price.\nIt would seem to us that the foregoing suggests a reb\'tivelv high\nk vel of prices for raw s for several vcars. Should England lose the\nsupremacy of the sea, however, conditions might be ni iteriallv chang\ned, for in that case tropical sugars which are now going to I\'.ngland\nwould be offend in the Ainerknii market, with a consequent lowering\nof prices.\nU.

Honolulu:\nThe sa!s for tiie week totalled\nS1242.\'i9 from 62 consignments.\nI.titiS AND POULTRY. Fresh\n1...l\nimi-ivvii eggs are getting scarcer\nand scarcer and the price has ad\nV.HII.V.U m me nignest ngure in\nmonius, with indications that It\nwill go still higher. Duck eggs are\nscarce and price has advanced.\nthe price of chickens remains\nabout the same as last week. There\nis a good demand for young chick\nens and the supply i s limited,\nL,ast week a large shipment of\nMuscovy ducks was received and\na good supply is still on hand. It\nwould be advisable not to ship any\nduring the week.\nVEGETABLES. Irish Potatoes,\nfirst grade are Selling for ?1.50 a\n!UU ios. and small potatoes as low\nas $1 .25 a 100 lbs. Sweet potatoes\nare plentiful with the best grades\nselling for as low a price as $1.00\na 100 lbs. A good many sweet po\ntatoes received have been riddled\nwith worm holes. Before shipping\nbreak open a iew and make sure\nthat they arc alright. Weevily\nsweet potatoes are a total loss when\nshipped to Honolulu. There are\nno island onions in the market.\nCabbage is in demand at 2!?? a\npound stripped. A great deal of\nthe cabbage received is in very\npoor condition, due to bagging\nwnen wet. Make sure that cabbage\nis dry before shipping. The mar\nket is bare of sweet corn and would\nbe a good seller at this time. Tur\nnips are in demand at very good\nprices. Now is the time to ship.\nFRESH FRUITS. Chinese ban\nnanas are exceedingly cheap and\nplentiful. Cooking bananas are in\ndemand at the usual gcod prices.\nLimes are fairly plentiful and the\nprice is a little lower than usual.\nStrawberries are scarce and in de\nmand.\nDRIED BEANS AND GRAIN, I\nRed Kula and Calico beans are\nselling well at good prices. Small\nwhites are also in demand. No\ndried peas have yet anived. Th-re\nwould be a good market for these\nat . Small grain, yellow, is\nselling at fair pr\'ces, considering\nthe low price of Manchurian corn.\nLarge yellow corn is selling well\nat good prices.\nLIVE STOCK, MEATS AND\nHIDES. The hog supply is short\nand the price has advanced one\ncent over last week, both for live\nweight and dressed pork. The\ndressed meat quotation remains\nabout the same.\nDuring the week an attempt\nwas made to secure a revolving\nfund from the Territorial govern\nment, to carry on the work of the\nDivision and insure prompt pay\nments for the farmers. This was\nrefused and nothing can be done\nuntil the Legislature meets. It is\nhoped, however, that a working\nfund can be secured from some of\nthe commercial organizations o r\nfrom some bank, in order to help\nout the work of the Division. As\nthe \'impropriation for the market\ning v.-ork is very small and the\ncommissions and charges on con\nsignments do not amount to a\ngreat deal, the Division is doing\naway with its ware house and is\ncutting down the office force.\nF\nree\n1 idU\nIs Net as\nIt Souncs\nSweet\nc0\nLook at the Price of SiiLr.\'r. for Instance.\nENCOURAGE YOUR OWN COI N"\nIt Pay\nI\'RV.\nTO\nfin\nmt\'\n, pirii\'i\ntiie f\nthat\nwing\ni t re\n1 lis-1 t\'ie I\'rt e trivle ;(K a can bi\nIs\nUnder the abne heading the Chic\nedi\'orial comments on the tariff situa\nfen ing to sugar:\nOccasionally v. have poin\'td out\njverdone- and had hem overdone.\nTalk about cheap Argentine beef and taking off thv d\'.\nwell.\nWhen the taking ends, von find that you have discouraged the\nAmerican farmer and beef is dearer.\nIt is all vet v well to talk ."bout free sugar and the poor man\'s codec\ncup, and to take the tariff off the sugar as this country has done.\nBut when the talking ends. y u find that the American growers of\nsugar are discouraged, disheartened, with good cause.\nSouthern cane sugar plantations re abandoned.\nNorthern beet-sugar enterprises are "riven up in despair.\nAnd now the poor man, with his coffee cuu and his tea cup. finds\nthat sugar has gone up from two to four cents a pound, and is Ki"H\nhigher because taking off that duty dis ouraged American sugar\ngrowers and made the country dependent on the foreign sugr.r grower.\nThis need not be very serious vet.

If\nmore votss are cast, Rice\'s figures\nwill probably be enlarged.\nTourist Promotion\nSometime ago the Maui Cham\nber of Commerce decided to with\ndraw its financial support from the\nHawaii Promotion Committer, and\nnow we hear that the Valley Is\nlanc\'ers will cjrr on a tourist pro\nmotion scheme of their own. by\nKeeping a man in Honolulu for\nthe purpose of steering tourists\ndefinitely to the island of Maui.\nIt has been observable for a long\ntime that the results of the work\nof the Hawaii Promotion Commit\ntee have been of pecuniary in\nterest ou!v to the hotels, curio\ndealers and chnffciirs of Honolulu;\nthe Hawaii branch of the local\nsteamship company; and the Hilo\nRailway, Volcano Stables Com\npany and a couple of Greek eating\nnouses on uawan. me ueneiits\nreceived by West Hawaii, Maui\nand Kauai from the tourist busi\nness lias been, ami is, more ot a\njoke than a business reality.\nAsked if we are in favor of the\nHawaii Promotion Committee as an\ninstitution, we reply, unhtsitati.ig\n1 yes. Are we in favor of pro\nmoting tourist travel? Yes, again;\nmost certainly.\nBut the point is that the\nHawaii Promotion Committee does\nnot meet the rcijuiremimts of the\nIslands outside of Honolulu and\nthe\nvolcano route.\nFor the pur\nposes of Honolulu, Hilo and the\nYulcano Hons--, it is a good thing;\nand the out-in-the-coid districts are\nglad of it.\nWe do not charge any luxi;ess or\nthe part of the Hawaii Promotion\nCommittee in its efforts to steer\ntout ists wav and to Maui and\nI.. r.- u i.. t 1\n.. .. ; \' .\'\npiepareu to conceue mat very siren- i\nnous ctlo\' l hav lie e- m u; lie it i\nit times, V. n-r those line\nwi: do think, h iwever, is\n-lat 1\nthat the\nHawaii Promotion Committee is\n.capable of "delivering the goods",\nn\nfar as the Islands, r utside of\nHonolulu am:\ntl:e Volcano route,\nre com erned .\nIt has, therefore, come to a Pa-si\nwhere if Maui, Kauai and other is\n\'.amis districts desiie tourists they \' ("\'er be left entirely to the com\nmust them-elvts go to Honolulu j mittee. Kauai audiencies are mix\nMter them. It" sufficiently interest- d, and are somewhat original as to\nthe\nUsiile-\n-like\nwav to\nabout it is to ketp men t Hoiioln- \'\n!:i for the purpose of directing !\ntounsts to the individual, outside\nlocaiit es referred to: and in this re\nspect, Mjni is on the tight tack.\nWe sh-ili watch the Maui ex peri -m.\n-lit with interest, and with everv\nh.. that it may prove successful.\nWhile on this\nlike to say that\ntibjttt, we would\ni spirit of what\nseems to lie arrcgant condescension\nseems to a!!;i t --oaie d\' our Hono-\nlulu friends nowadays when it\ni comes to dealing with communities\ni of the outside islands. A streak\nI of it runs through the Hawaii Pro\nI motion Committee, and there is a\nstill larger streak in the Territorial\n\'government. Wc are inclined to\nthe opinion that it is not apprec at-\nedon Hawaii and Maui, nnd are jol\nly well satisfied that it is resented on\nKauai. An instance of this came\nup last week, when the new super\nintendent of public works made a\ngrand-stand play before the Harbor\nCommissioners and in the Honolu\nlu newspapers, the intent being to\ncreate the impression that he w is\nseeking to grant some great favor to\nthe island of Kauai, but could not\ndo so on account of the failure of\nthe Kauai Chamber of Commerce\nto answer promptly his letters for\ncertain information.\nThe great favor - the important\nconcession - of this wonderful man\nin this wonderful department, was\na proposal to appoint two wharf\ningers on Kauai at the grand sala\nry of 55 per. month each!\nThis is merely a small case in\npoint. Put it illustrates the spirit.\nLet Honolulu get out of its patro\nnizing mood, and come right down\nto business with the outside islands,\non the tourist and other proposi\ntions; and better results will surely\nfollow.\nReturning directly to the subject\nof tourist promotion, we are un\nable to see why Kauai and Maui\nshould contribute to the expense\nof inducing travel on the Honolu\nlu - Hilo route unless there should\nbe hope of more tourists \' \'seeping\'\nthrough into these localities than\nhave been in evidence in the past.\nIt would be just as reasonable for\nthe Hawaii Promotion Committee\nto contribute to the support of the\ntourist committees of San Francis\nco and Los Angeles, on the ground\nof the travel that might "seep"\nthrough over there into Honolulu.\nSuggest the latter proposition to\nHonolulu, and Honolulu would go\n"up in the air". And at the same\ntime Honolulu expects Maui and\nK;Hiai to do that very thing.\nFuture Theatricals\nThe venture of the Kauai Cham\nber of Commerce into the field of\ntheatrical amusements has thus far\nproved successful and s rtisfactory ,\nand it is to be hoped that fur\nther efforts along the same line will\nbe put forward later on. Undoubt\nedly the entertainments of the Ju\nvenile Bostonians have been much\nenjoyed, and, coming at this time,\nhave given our people something\nmore pleasant to think and talk\nabout than the war and troubles of\nKurope.\nIt would, perhaps, be a fin\'\' ! familiar with the proposed estrav\nthing to continue the present thta-j ordinance was not, to our mind, as\ntrical committee of the Chamber j potent a reason as might have been\n"on the job" for future occasions, j thought of for postponing it. A\nand h ive it carefully select and better one. for instance, would\nbring over suitable theatrical aggre-! have been the idea that the police\ngations three or four times a year, i men of the island need exercise,\nwhich would be endorsed and sup- and the work of posting up thd\nported as the Juvenile Bostoniaus , notices would do them good. A\nhave been. Of course it would i t-. second belter reason, perhaps, is\ntoo great a strain, and would be j that the pesky, estrav cows might\nrather "stretching" the busines:- die and the ordinance be rendered\nand province ot a purely comuK-r- unnecessary, There are many\ncial body for the Chamber of Cor.:-\nmeree to take an nrtivn imt i\n- um.ni ui.u\nmight feel inclined Kami-wards;\nU seen,s to us t!lat a carefully\nin-jecleu Ulealnc:u enterprise mivut\nhuite appropriately be supported at\nlntervals. sa\'. ot three o r\n,l,l!r\nmonths.\nIn carrying out such an idea,, it\n,i ii ,i . ., ,\n)uui ,.e ntcessan that the selec-\nin ot companies to lie brontiht\ntastes. A local Committee Would lie.\nfamiliar with those peculiarities.\n"d would be able to satisfy them,\nwhile an outside promoter, or thca-\ntrical manager, would be more apt\nto score a miss than to strike the\nfancy of a loral\'aiidience.\nIt might, also, be a good idea t )\nhave the next company land at\nLihueand work around to Waimea.\ngiving that route a trial, if lor r;n\nother rea-on than to ascertain\nwhich might bit the belter scheme.\nSaturday\'s Election\nThr Harden Island wishes to\nmake one more appeal to the voters\nof Kauai in the interest of the can\ndidacy of Hon. Charles A. Rice at\nthe polls next Saturday.\nThe voters of Kauai have sup\nported Mr. Rice in the past. It is\nof more vital importance that they\nsupport him now.\nThe Territory today needs more\nthan anything else an active man\nin Washington. Kauai .needs an\nactive man there. A son of Kauai,\nwhose capabilities, energy and\nhonesty are recognized the Islands\nover, has volunteered to assume\nthis great responsibility.\nKauai should take the lead in\nhis support, and should endeavor\nto give him as near a unanimous\nvote as possible in the primary.\nRepublicans of everv nationality\nshould vote for Mr. Rice; those of\nindependent affiliations should also\ndo so to a man.\nThe situation has been pretty\nwell gone over, and every voter\nknows what it is.\nThe question is with vou: Will\nyou vote for Rice and competency\nand activity, or will you vote for\nKuhio and two more rears of\nfailure and disappointment?\nHawaii And Sugar\nNow that the war has brought\nclearly to the attention of the Am\nerican people the fact that they are\nat the mercy of Kurope when it\nconies to the important matter of\nsugar, will not something be done\nto place the United States in a\nmore independent position?\n1 lie L nited states today pro\nducts only 800,000 tons of sugar\nper annum, and consumes 3,300,\n0C tons. It is easily to be seen\nthat 2.500,000of the sugar consum\ned on the mainland is imported.\nWhy i s that enormous amount\nof sugar imported into a country\nwhich in itself contains ideal sugar\nproducing conditions?\n1 lie reason is t ti e handicap\nwhich American sugar is forced to\ncarry, causing would-be growers\nof beets and cane to give the in\ndu;try a wide berth. What, how\never, is proposal under trie new\nl.r:ff? Why, it is simply to further\nstrangle the already far inadequate\nAmerican sugar industry, increase\nthe amount of sugar importations\nand keep up the price to the Amer\nican consumer.\nWhat a great pity this Terriiory\nhas not in Washington at the pres\nent time a Delegate who could\n! properly\nand forcibly emphasize\nthis matter before Congress,\ni\nTin; srciciKSTioN that the peo\nple of Kauai were not sufficiently\nother equally good reasons for post-\n,.T ,1, "-,i;..,...

The snow\ngradually disappeared and we be\ngan to see wild flowers and we be\ngan to see some of the wonderful\nItalian vineyards built up on the\nhillsides in terraces. The train sped\nalong the east shore of Lago de\nComo and we saw many handsome\nvillas and said good-bye to snow\nand ice.\nWe teached the old town of Mi\nlan in the evening, going to tine\nHotel Cavour, the quietest in lie\ntown. It was rather noisy, but\nthere a:e no really good hotels in\nMilan and all are rather poor and\nnoisy. The most famous buildings\nin Milan are the Cathedral and one\nof the opera ho.ises. The Cathedral\nis a splendid mass of pinnacles and\nmarble figures and boasts of the\nfinest colored glass windows in\nEurope. There are so many ugly\nbuildings crowding around the\nCathedral that one loses the beauty\nof it to a great extent.\nFortunately for us the 2nd night\ntee were there the Opera Co. pre\nsented "Parsifal" and through our\nhotel porter (the only man in a\nEuropean h itel who knows any\nthing) we managed to get two\ngood tickets and much lo our\npleasure heard a grand opera, and\nas the theater is the largest in the\nworld the stage se\'tins were\nsuperb.\nWe also had the pleasure of\nhearing Sig.

The Italians around Flor\nence were very thrifty people and\nit was a pleasure to drire through\nthe country and tee their well kept\nfarms.\nFlorence was delightful. Spring\nwas in the air and the peach and\napple troes in full bloom, and a\nspirit o f friendliness seemed to\npervade all the sheps and people,\nand it was fun to wander up th\nlittle narrow streets only 8 or 16\nft. wide and see the life of the\npeople, with never a rude remark\nheard all the time we were there.\nThev had tat naost delightful little\ntaxi cabs there, jst held my party\nand a jorial old driver that knew\na few English or French words\nand we guessed the rest, with the\naid of a little Latin learned inschool\nand off we would go. The meter\nstarted at 12 cts. U. S., and grad\nually worked p to 30 cts.

Although\nit was tourist season and crowds\neager to go. they refused to put oa\na larger car or more of them, but\njust left the crowds to fight for\nplaces. The car had a little trailer,\nand although the conductor taid it\nwent all the way to Fiesole, they\ndropped it off just at the be\nginning i the last climb and all\nthe people tiding in il had to get\nt and walk half a mile uphill tm\n.lie end of the line or f3v a dollar\nand tel an obliging carnage driver\nto carry one the rest of the way.\nnation s i\nthe Adi-;..\nwish to -\nREAD THE GARDEN ISLAM\ngiven a\nbeach home Suiulav afternoon. s;,ul ,his "\'i.ruing that subscrip\npjopleof Liluif, Koloa and the ; tio,ls continue to come in toward\ntowns all along the hue to Wai- S7500 funds which the German\n,,. i t,ir,-;,.tr m to r .,t. vtm tl,eni. .residents of Hie territory are rais-\n, .i:.. :.. . .. .i.Ji\'itf and\n111 llIU MJU.

A force moving from Brussels is advancing with a view to\ncutting Antwerp off from communication with Ostend. To embarrass\ntVie German advance, the Belgians are fallinv back toward Antwerp,\ncutting the dykes as they retreat and inundating the country with\nwater. It i.i possible that the move of the Germans may have Ostend,\nwith its British-Russian arm , as an objective, instead of Antwetp,\nwhich is heavilv defended.\nThe Germans !)iirned houses and the railway depot at Buggeii\nhout, and cut telegraph wires. Communication between Ghent and\nAntwerp., via Dendcrmondc, was cut yesterday and later it was\nlearned that Derrdermonde had been occupied by the Germans.\nGERMANS AND FRENCH\nThe situation between the German and French armies last night\nis officially reported as unchanged.\nThe enveloping movement of the Germans has been definitely\nchecked by the Allies.\nDefensive work at Paris is proceeding actively and on a vast scale.\nGermans reported as moving farther south-eastward, and to have evac\nuated country between Scnlis and Compeigne.
