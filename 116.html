        <pre>['I\n(FOR GUAfER MISSISSIPPI "|\nDevoted to the Industrial. Commercial and A^ricnl*\ni tnral Development of the Wonderful Resources of\n. the State .... Items of Interest from all Quarters.\nBy H. E. ELAKESLEB. JacKson. Miss. I\nNO IE. Secretaries of industrial leagues,\nprogressive union* and all organisations of\n« like nature, are requested to furnish the\nwriter with nottoo of matter that would bo\nor Inter -st to readers of this department.\nNewspapers are also requested to send\nmarked copies containing mention of new\nenterprises good yields of crop, extra stock\netc , or to plaae tho writer on the mailing\nf.° matters can be properly\n♦ n « highly appreciate any of\na a ^fors that might bo sent regular\'y.\nA**,PrOeft people aro oordially requested to\nm,-k\'e this ofileo headqunrtors while in Jack\nson. Always have a comfortable chair, ex\nchanges, stationery and a hearty greeting\nfor the fraternity.\n*\nFr the steenth number of times\nthe writer insists that trucking does\npay in Mississippi. Here is another\nsigned experience by one of the best\nknown truckers in the state and a gen\ntleman who has been in the business\ncontinually for a long time. These\nexperiences ought to be convincing,\nand will with people who are looking\nfor facts and figures. While the re\nsults here shown are for a small patch\nof raddishes, Mr. Dnmmcron has\nequally good results with other crops\nI as well.\nMr. H. E. Blakesleet —\nI herewith enclose statement of the\nradish crop that I grew last year:\nSix pounds of radish seed at 40\ncents, $2.40; Breaking and preparing\nhalf an acre of ground, $2.75; Four\nwomen 8 hours planting seed, $1.60;\nSix women 8 hours thinning plants,\n$2.40; Gathering, bunching and pack\ning for market 180 crates of radishes,\n$18.00; One hundred and eighty\ncrates at 8 1-2 cents, $15.30. Total\ncost of production, $42.45. One hun\ndred and eighty crates brought on\nplatform at Madison, $166.65. Less\ncost of production, $42.45. Net pro\nfit on one half acre in radishes, $124.\n20. After taking off the radish crop\nI planted the land in whippoorwill\npeas and today hauled in about 3,000\npounds of well cured hay. I would\nhavo netted more had not the seed\nf come up so well.\nI* Yours truly,\nJ. T. Dammeron.\nNow if there is a gentleman any\nwhere that desires to have these fig\nures or a statement from Mr. Dam\nmeron direct, address him at Madison\nStation with a stamped envelop and\nthe reply will be forthcoming. $124.20\nclear profit from half an acre planted\nin radishes and then over a ton of\npea vine hay is a pretty good showing\nfor hill land is it not? Great is Mis\nsissippi and greater still the many\ngood things in store for her in the\nfuture. Why should anyone desire\nto leave this country in search of a\nbetter one elsewhere?\nIt is refreshing note with what\ngreat interest tu .tire southern\nportion of the st\'( s ta\' r>g to the\nCorn and Cotto C^ri ’v"1 to be held\nin Jackson in December. ..ill towns of\nany size have asked for space and are\narranging to make splendid exhibits.\nThe railroads are all taking an in\nterest and some of them will have es\npecially handsome and complete ex\nhibits of the products of the country\nalong their lines. The Illinois Cen\ntral, Southern, Gulf and Ship Island,\nMobile, Jackson and Kansas City and\nthe Liberty-White are all arranging\nto show up their territories in the\nbest possible light. Gulfport and\nHarrison county propose to make an\nexhibit that will be hard to excel.\nT « 1 .1 . • i! _ \\_\nIjUUIci, wuu na cuoraviwiBuu\ntling qualities, will let the world\nknow what is being done in the piney\nwoods, the Liberty-White, only a few\nweeks old, will make a very credita\nble showing. This activity presages\ngreat things for the future of our\ngtaie and should encourage other com\nmunities to fall into line and gather\na few of the good things going.\nAbout a year since the delta town\nof Hollandale was almost wiped from\nthe map by a fire. A great transfor\nmation has taken place since and it\nhas been rebuilt in a much more sub\natantial manner. A person who has\nnot been there since would hardly\nknew it. The principal street is built\nalmost entirely of brick, most of the\nbuildings being two stories high, and\nfor material and design are far ahead\nof most buildings found in towns of\nthat size. It boasts of one of the best\nhanks in the country, has a system of\nwa erVorkB and electric lights that\nwould do\'credit to a much larger place\nand many- other , improvements of a\nlike nature. It is one of the best\ntowns in the delta and its citizens\nwill quickly remind you of that fact\nvk»n you prirtjMf ftMt*\nPresident J. C. Hardy of the A.\naud M. College gives some very inter\nesting statistics as to the productive\ncapacity of the white and black coun\nties, showing that where the negro\npopulation is larger than the white\nless cotton is produced per acre, even\nthough the lands in the black counties\nare more fertile and valuable. For\ninstance: Lowndes county 21,972\nblacks to 7,121 whites while Jones\nhas 13,156 whites to 4,670 blacks, yet\nit requires 3.15 acres of \'.owndes\ncounty land to make a bale of eotton,\nwhile in Jones it takes 1.98 acres to\nmake a bnle. The lands in Lowndes are\nassessed at $9.83 per acre while those\nin Jones are assessed at $2.85. Nox\nubee county with more than five\nblacks to one white, having 25,146\nblacks, 4,699 whites, requires 3.50\nceres to make a bale of cotton, al\nthough Union with three whites to\nane black, having 12,380 whites and\n’•142 blacks, requires only 2.56 acres\nto moke a bale. The farm lands of\nNoxubee are assessed at $7.12 per\nlore and those of Union at $4.81.\nHinds county with three negroes to\n>ne white man. having 35,521 blacks j\nto 13,037 whites, requires 2.50 acres j\no make a bole, although Perry coun\ny with more than two whites to one\ntegro requires only 1.96 acres to raise\n» bale. The farm lands of Hinds are\ncalued at three times what are those\n>f Perry. The difference in production\nmist be due to intelligent cultivation\nit the same ratio is good in all other\ncounties where the comparison was\nmade.\nLet every dissatisfied, disgruntled,\n>our and dyspeptic citizen read what\nme man made off half an acre of rad\nshes, and either get his face straight\n>r get off the face of the ear;h. There\ns nothing at all wrong with Mississippi\n*xeept that so many of her people re\nfuse to accept what wo have and go\nificr it in the right way. Here is a\npoor hill section of the state that a\nfew years since was looked upon as\nworthless except to hold the world\n:ogether, bringing the owners over\nMOO per acre clear profit. There is\nio danger of overstocking the market.\nHie demand is always good for all\ndnds of vegetah\' s and canning fac\n:ories are being stablished to work\nip that which is not so desirable to\nship. Any man who has spoken dis\nparagingly of the state in the past\nshould get right down on his knees\nmd beg forgiveness and then get up\n»nd go to work along better lines.\nA northern man, J. J. Wilson, of\nPittsburg, Pa., has made an invest\nment of $50,000 near Pelahatchio and\nlas organized an ?..• r action to pro\nmote education t c the production\n>f fruits and vegetr is. Mr. Wilson\naas great faith in the future of the\nsouth and will leave his large inter\nests in the north with his partners\nand come south to make his future\naome. The association begins with\nibout fifty members and about 400\nacres will be planted the first year,\nrhey will no doubt be successful in\n[he object undertaken. It is to be\nregretted that our people do not take\nup these advanced mefhods of growing\nfruits and vegetables and not wait\nfor outsiders to come in and reap the\n-ream of the profit before they fall\ninto line. They will fall in after they\nsee what the other fellow is doing,\nbut why not take the initiative?\nThe country around West Point\nhas a surplus of corn and there is\n» perplexing question as to l ew it can\nbe handled with profit. The building\nof an elevator is being agitated and\nsomething will likely be done right\naway. It looks pretty good for Mis\nsissippi to furnish neighboring states\nwith corn, but why not? We are not\ntied to cotton as the o»e crop. This\nis a good corn and grain country and\none of the objects of the Corn and\nCotton Carnival to be held in Jack\nson in December is to prove to the\noutside world, this fact.\nThe Magnolia Electric Railway has\nbeen chartered for the purpose of\nbuilding a line from Magnolia to Sum\nmit. taking in the intermediate towns\nof Fernwood, Whitetown and Mc\nComb City. The route would only be\na few miles in length and would con\nnect several towns with a combined\npopulation of twelve or thirteen thou\nsand. The capital stock is $250,000\nand the incorporators well known cap\nitalist* who are confidently expected\nto put the project through without\nf*tt» -\nMISSISSIPPI NEWS MATTERS\nA Biisf Chronicle of the Important Happenings\n^-----— ■————^—— ———— — -\nQuitman, Banner County.\nThe little county of Quitman has\nsent in its personal roll to the Audi\ntor and it has the honor of showing\nthe largest per cent of increase of\nany county which has reported to the\nAuditor.

The\nvalue of its personal property this\nyear is $438,670, which is an increase\nof $231,093 over last year. Lowndes\n-;ent in its personal roll this week and\nthe value of its property is $1,389,\n190, an increase of $187, 716 over last\nyear.

He will hold his first court\nnext Monday in Calhoun county.\nConvict Killed.\nHenry Dodson, a negro serving a\nterm on the county convict farm for\nlarceny near Brookhaven, was shot\nind killed while attempting to escape\nby Sam Posey, a guard. When the\nprisoners went to work Dodson re\nnarked to the superintendent that\nthis would be the last day that ho\nwould work. On the first opportuni\nty, when he had gotten a little apart\nfrom the others, he made a break for\nliberty. The guard used a winchester\nrifle and brought him down at the\nfirst fire. He expired almost imme\ndiately. Poftey was arrested.\nPinching the Tigers.\nDeputy Sheriff. E. C. Ballentine has\nplaced in jail Anthony Pickett, who\nwas tried before Judge John A. Seal,\nof Pi aldington, and convicted of sell\ning blind tiger whiskey. He was fined\n$100 and given a sentence of thirty\ndays in the county jail. Felix Coop\ner was tried before Judge M. F. Bax\nter, of Logtown, and convicted on the\nsame charge and given a like sen\ntence. The evidence in these cases\nwas worked up by Deputy Sheriff,\nBallentine.\nThree Were Indicted.\nThe grand jury at Augusta has in\ndicted J. A. Parker and J. M. Black\nfor the murder of W. A. Phipps, the\ncrime being committed some months\nago. Parker was remanded to jail\nwithout bail, and Black ^vas admitted\nto bail in the sum of $500.

Boutwell, a\nfarmer living near Ellisville, occurred\nan unique cotton picking contest, the\nparticipants being his four sons, the\neldest being 22 years of age. They\npicked 504, 510, 423 and 409 pounds\nrespectively, making a total of 1,846\npounds for the day.\nPrimary is Ordered.\nThe city executive committee of\nEllisville. selected prior to the last\ncity election, two years ago, has order\ned a primary election for the nomina\ntion of city officials this year. The\ndates for the primaries will be Oct.\n25 and y. 1. 1904, the regular elcc\nbib* field la\nTo Keep out Boll Worm.\nSecretary Wilson, head of the Ag\nricultural Department of the United\nStates Government, advises that a\nbelt of corn be planted around cotton\nfields to prevent an invasion of the\nboll worm. He says that the worm\nmuch prefers corn ears to cotton bolls\nand in this way the cotton field can\nbe successfully protected from its rav\nages.\nOxford’s County Fair.\nOxford proposes to hold a county\nfair hereafter where the best of the\ncounty’s products will be shown and\na good natured rivalry encouraged\namong the people in getting the great\nest amount of crop from an acre and\nraising better stock, etc. The scheme\nwofild be a good one and we hope to\nsee the Lafayette Fair made a per\nmanent institution.\nTo Pave Sidewalks.\nPontotoc is issuing bonds to the\namount of $4,000 for the urpose of im\nproving streets and sidewalks. The\nexample of Pontotoc should be follow\ned by other towns in the state. Noth\ning brings so much contentment and\nsatisfaction to residents or creates so\ngood an impression upon visitors as\ngood streets and side walks.\nWants Board of Trade.\nNot entirely satisfied with the\ngrowth of the town, Belzoni is agi\ntating the matter of a business or\nganization to help matters along. Bel\nzoni is doing splendidly as it is, but\na live, wide-awake business organi\nzation conducted strictly on business\nprinciples, would be a great help to\nthe material development of the town.\nLocates at Hattieburg.\nIt is announced that the Colored\nOrphan Asylum and Industrial School\nwhich the negroes of Mississippi have\nbeen planning to erect at some point\nin this state, will be located near Hat\ntiesburg.

The Postel Elegant Tro\nphy is to be shot for at this time and\nthere will be a lively contest for it.\nStreet Improvement.\nNewton will use $5,000 improving\nthe stre ts and sidewalks. The bonds\nhave been issued and the work rushed\nthrough before bad weaiher sets in.\nThis is a commendable step in the\ngood people of Newton and other\ntowns might profit by her example.\nAnother New Town.\nGovernor Vardanian has issued a\nproclamation, incorporating the vil\nlage of Silver City, Yazoo county,\nwith S. D. Frazier, mayor; W. 11.\nJohnson, marshal; Aldermen, C. T.\nPartee, A. A. Johnson, R. C. Stuber\n(ield and J. II. Reed.\nBuilding at West Point.\nWest Point reports twelve brick\nbusiness houses going up there at the\npresent and many other improvements\nunder way. The Business League is\nactively at work and the result is be\ning showing in accomplishments.\nValuable Invention.\nA Mississippi man, Mr. Matt John\nson, of Natchez, has recently had pat\nented a very valuable invention, which\nis designed to reduce the cost of ex\ntracting oil from cotton seed.\nCost Him His Life.\nJerry Anderson, a negro who es\ncaped from jail, was killed by Deputy\nSheriff D.

I\nstepped on a nail, which caused\nthe cords in my leg to contract\nand an abscess to rise in my\nknee, and the doctor told me\nthat I would have a stifi leg, so\none day I went to J. F. Lord’s\ndrug store (who is now in Den\nver, Colo.). He recommended a\nbottle of Know Liniment; I got\na 50e. size, and it. cured my leg.\nIt is the best liniment in the\nworld.”\nAbscesses, with few excep\ntions, are indicative ot constipa\ntion or debility. They may, how\never, result front blows or from\nforeign bodies, introduced into\nthe skin or flesh, sucli as splin\nters, thorns, etc.\nBallard’s Snow Liniment is for\nsale by Ward, the druggist.\nPublic Speaking.\nUnder the above caption a cir\ncular, which lias been distributed\nthroughout the county, contains\nthe following:\nWe, the undersigned, will ad\ndress the people upon the live\npolitical issues ot the day, at the\nfollowing named places:\nHickory, Saturday, Oct. 1, 11\no’clock a. m.\nChunky, Saturday, Oct. 1, 7:30\no’clock p. m.\nScooba, Monday, Oct. 3rd, 11\no’clock a. m.\nLeKalb, Tuesday, Oct. 4th, 11\no’clock a. tn.\nLiberty, Wednesday, Oct. 5th,\nil o’clock a. m.\nA good attendance is hoped\nlor.

Now,\naccording to my judgment, that\nis a mistake.

You know full\nwell that there are very tew men\nin this county capable of filling\nthis position who have funds\nenough to keep all wheels run\nning, teams in order, etc., with\na six months pay. Labor is at\na premium in this Beat, and a\nman is lucky to secure good ne\ngroes even with an assurance ot\nweekly pay.\nAs it is absolutely necessary\ntor a man to invest at least\n§1,500.00 to thoroughly equip\nhimself for good road work, I\nhold that it is unreasonable to\nexpect hint to work less than\ntme hundred miles of road per\ncontract. The largo number of\nimplements, together with stock,\nrequires a considerable sum ot\nmoney to keep shipshape.—\nHence the objection to six\nmonths pay.\nI sincerely hope that you will\nnot think any ot this unreasona\nble, and with kind regards and\nbest wishes, I am\nSincerely yours,\n“UNCLE GkORGE,”\nContractor from N.

Engi\nneers of Both Trains Buried Be\nneath the Debris. Cause of Acci\ndent Unknown.\nKnoxville, Tenn.—Running on a\nroadbed in a supposedly high condi\ntion of maintenance and having about\nthem every safeguard known to mod\nern railroading, two trains on the\nSouthern rnilrond, carrying heavy\nlists of passengers came together in a\nfrightful head-on collision near\nHodges, Tenn., Saturday afternoon,\n•ending fifty-four people to death and\ninjuring one hundred and twenty-five,\n•cveral of whom will probably die.\nThiss appallingloss of life and maim\ning of the living resulted apparently\nfrom the disregarding of orders given\nto the two trains to meet at a station\nwhich has for a long time been their\nregular meeting point. The claim of\nfailure to see either the station or\nsignals cannot be set up by the engi\nneer of the westbound train were he\nalive to enter a ploa of defense, as\nthe accident happened in broad day\nlight, and, according to the best in\nformation obtainable, he hod the or\nder in a little frame in front of him\nss his monster of iron and steel rush\ned by New Market and soon after\ncame full upon an eastbound passen\nger train making for New Market in\n\'■ iiipiiuiuv/uo tu uirui\nthe westbound train which carried the\nsleepers from the east for Knoxville,\nChattanooga and other southern cities.\nThe possibility exists that the ill\nfated engineer may have been asleep\nor that death had suddenly taken the\nsight from his eyes before New Mar\nket was reached. But nothing is\nknown save that the orders were not\nobeyed. The trains were on time and\nnot making over thirty-five miles an\naour, yet the impact as they rounded\ni curve and came suddenly upon each\nother was frightful. Both engines and\nthe major portions of both trains were\ndemolished. Why the orders were dis\nregarded or misinterpreted will never\noe known as the engineers of the two\ntrains were crushed, their bodies re\nmaining for hours under the wreck\nage of the monster locomotives, which\nbut a short time before had leaped\nforward at the touch of their strong\nhands upon the throttle.\nDreamed end Jumped.\nBattle Creek, Mich.—At a sanita\nrium in this city a wealthy patient\nfrom Chicago, connected with a fam\nily well known throughout the West,\nbut whose name is withheld by the\nmanagers of the institution, dreamed\nthat she was jumping from a window.\nAwakening, she ran to the window of\nher room, four stories above the ce\nment driveway, pushed out the screen\nand leaped into space. Her sister\nawakened just in time to catch a fly\ning glimpse of the woman’s night robe\nas she cleared the window sill. The\nfalling woman crashed into an awning\nbelow, which broke her fall and saved\nher from being crushed to death ou\nthe pavement. As it was she rose with\nonly a bruised elbow and walked un\naided to her room, four flights of\nstairs above.\nA Persuasive Man.\nSan Francisco.—Compelling two\nclerks to go into a room at the point\nof a revolver, to be made prisoners, a\nmasked man took a suit case contain\ning $4400 and records and papers be\nlonging to the Central Grain and\nStock Exchange, and then made his\nescape. F. J. Flynn and H. T. Pear\nny are clerks employed by the ex\nchange, and they were carrying the\nsuit case containing the gold, silver\nand paper into the office through a\npassageway in the rear of the office,\nwhen they were confronted by the\nrobber. The thief was hidden behind\na partition so that he could not be\nseen until a person was within a few\nfeet of him.\nNew York—Dr. Edward T. W. El\nlis, whose father is said to have been\na colonel on the staff of General\nGrant, and President of a Rockford,\n111., bank, will appear before Recorder\nGoff for sentence, having pleaded\nguilty to stealing gold from a dentist’s\noffice. In court Ellis made the plea\nthat he had stolen so that he might\nbuy bread for his wife and 6-year-old\ndaughter, whom he represented to be\nin a atarving condition. Mrs. Ellis\nlater denied this statement, and said\nshe had supported herself and daugh\nter for some time.\n* General Miles to Speak.\nNew York.—Gen. Nelson A. Miles\nwill take the stump for Judge Parker.\nHe made this announcement just after\na visit to Chairman Taggart this week.\nHe said that he would make several\nspeeches during the campaign, under\nthe auspices of the speakers’ bureau.\nBrewery Building Bums.\nTiffla.

Try to\nwalk around the walls of your parlor\nwith your body parallell to its floor\nand you may get some idea of what\nhe accomplishes at every performance\nin riding and rising on an absolutely\nperpendicular line up the circular in\nside of “The Devil’s Chimney,” the\ndiameter of which is less than twelve\nfeet, within which restricted space he\nis compelled to generate the tremen\ndous force and to acquire sufficient\nspeed for the accomplishment of a\nfeat, which before his appearance\nwould have been pronounced a sheer\nimpossibility. At a superficial glance\n“The Wild Wheel Whirl” act, intro\nduced by the show in question at\nMadison Square Garden, New York,\nmight appear almost identical with\nthat of “Cyclone,” but when it is\nconsidered that its performers were\naided by a slanting circular track,\nwhile he starts from the ground\nstraight up, it can be seen that the\nJtiSC ,1 I »• I\numciumc! ill iuc | wu Ul\'lllClClUCUlS if\nessentially as phenominal as that rep\nresen ied by a walk np hill and one\nup a perpendicular precipice.\nAnts are a Failure.\nHouston, Tex. —Ross L. Clark, of\nPort Lavaca, who sued out an injunc\ntion to restrain the Agricultural De\npartment from bringing Guatemalan\nants into Texas, but afterward con\nsented to drop the action, is of the\nopinion that the ants have proved\'\nthat they are not the enemy of the boll\nweevil that it is elaimed they are. In\nfact, Mr. Clark regards the experi\nments which have so far been made\nat Victoria and at other points as a\ndistinct failure. His principal rea\nson for this belief is the admission by\nthe department experts that it will\nrequire about one hill of ants to leach\nfour stalks of cotton. Taking this as\na basis, Mr. Clark inquires what is to\nbe done with the ants after the boll\nweevils are exterminated?\n4 Aged Couple Tortured.\nWilkesbarre, Pa.—Three masked\nrobbers who broke into the house of\nMr. and Mrs. Thomas Gibbons, re\nsiding near Rosburg, have tortured the\naged couple in an effort to find hidden\nmoney. Gibbons and his wife were\npulled from bed and asked where their\nmoney was hidden. They denied hav\ning any and when threatened contin\nued their denial. Gibbons was then\nthrown back on the bed while the rob\nbers kicked and choked his wife until\nshe became unconscious and probably\nwill die. The robbers fled but one was\ncaptured and taken to Tunkahanock\njail under a heavy guard.\nRhodes Scholarships.\nBoston, Mass.—A party of thirty\nlive Rhodes scholarship winners will\nsail for England, from Boston, Sept.\n27th, to enter Oxford University.\nAmong them are: A. K. Read, of\nLouisiana; W. L. Kendall, of Okla~\nhoma; J. H. Kirkpatrick, of Alabama;\nand T. R. Ashby of Texas. Twenty\nstaterooms have been reserved for\nthem on the promenade deck. They\nare to pay a formal visit in a body to\nPresident Eliot, of Harvard, before\nsailing.\nBodies Parboiled.\nPort Arthur, Tex.—The bodies of\nthree of the four victims who fell into\nthe burning tank of oil have been re\ncovered. The bodies were parboiled\nbeyond recognition, but it is believed\nthat the body of J. F. McDonald is\nthe one which has been boiled to\npieces. Weeksach, the injured man,\nhas a chance for recovery.\nIndiana Man Missing.\nChicago—Frederick B. Hoover of\nAlbion, Ind., a jeweler who, with his\nwife, arrived in Chicago this week,\nhas disappeared from the hotel at\nwhich he was registered and his wife\nfears he has been the victim of rob\nbers.
