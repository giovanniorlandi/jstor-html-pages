Oct. \'J. Admiral W.\nS. Schley dropped dead in 4-Jtli street\nnear the comer of Fifty avenue, to-J\ndav. He had Ion;: suffered from\nheart disease.\nIn recent years the ndmiral was\nnot able for his championing of Dr.\nFrederick A. Cook\'s claim to being\ntho discoverer of the North Pole.\nSince his retirement from active ter\nvice he had lived quietly in iVubli\niuutou and New York.\nAdmiral Winfleld Scoll Schley\nwould have been 72 years of ago m\na week. Ho was a native of Freder\nick City, Md., appointed to tho United\nStates naval academy in 185G and\ngraduating in 1SU0, his promotion\nwas rapid and by 1874 he had come\nto be a commodore. He was appoint\ned rear admiral in 181)9.\nDuring the war with Spain Schley\ncommanded tho "flying squadron"\nand ho was in immediate command of\ntho vessels in the attack on Santiago\ndu Cuba, which resulted in the de\nstruction of Admiral Ccrvera\'s ,pcct.\nA memorable controversy followed\nthis battle as to whether the credit\nfor the victory belonged to Schley or\nto Admiral Sampson.\nRECALL INSULT\nSAYS GIBBOUS\n- -\nStorm of Comment is Caused by Dec\nlaraticn of Cardinal Says Cor\nrupt Judge Not as Dangerous as\nthe Slave.\nt .\nUALTIMOItPi, Md., Oct. 2. That\nthe recall is an insult to the dignity,\nindependence and 6clf-rcspect of the\njudiciary, is a statement made )y\nCanliuul Gibbous which is caubing a\nstorm of comment toduy throughout\nthe fust.\nIn a sermon delivered here, Car\ndinal Gibbons said: v a,\n"Far less menacing to tho common\nwealth is the occasional corrupt in\ncompetent jtiilj4U than the one who\nwould ho the habituul fdavu of the\ncapricious multitude, with his ear\nulwiiys, to the ground, tryjng to find\ntho peoplo\' veidit\'t.!\'1"\nLook for tho nd that dpsoribps lue\nplace you would liko to own,\nTP BOND ELECTION\nTIJ10 county bond election tlujuQiistruteil conclusively\nthat Jnekson county is tho most progressive county\nin Oregon. The majority for good roads was greater, in\nproportion to votes oast, than any other county in tho state\ncould muster. The election stamps the people of the\nUogue ftiver valley as the most enlightened and up-to-date\nof those of any portion of tho great northwest.\nA study of tho returns shows that, tho bonds had a\nclear majority outside the cities of aModford and Ashland\nand that those who will be most benefitted tho farmers\nand orchard ists, understand tho necessity and value of per\nmanent high wa vs.\nt\nAshland\'s vote was a disappointment, though not. a\nsurprise. Ashland is still troverncd by petty animosity and\nfactional jealousy. She has never been able to understand\nor forgive Aledford for growing. Then the election ctinie\ntoo suddenly. Ashland always approaches public im\nprovement like a oral) first she backs off, then sidles\naround and finally approves it. She is still in the bucking\noff stage on good rouds. But Ashland should cease playing\na discord in the choir of progress in .laokson county. She\nshould make common cause With her sister towns in work\ning for the common good or she will find herself ignored\nand isolated. She opposes a united county.\nAlmost without exception, the other precincts that\nopposed the bonds were isolated sections that need good\nroads worse than any other portion of the county regions\nthat are almost, completelv cut off during the winter raim\nseason. They are most inaccessible and will benefit more\nbv good roads than the thicker populated parts. The rea\nson they cast a majority vote against the bonds was be\ncause they did not understand tle propositipn apd were si\nscattered and isolated fha\'t they could not be reached foi\nexplanation.\nAs a result of the bond election, Jackson county is near\ner united than ever before. The people realize more koenh\nthan ever the necessity and need of co-operation in the up\nbuilding of the entire section. The growth and develop\nment of any one section means the improvement of all\nand this is realized more than ever.\nHenceforth development plans must be on a broadci\nplane. Publicity work must be more comprehensive and\nless sectional. The building of the town need ijot concern\nany of the communities. Their energies must be spent ii\ndeveloping the count\' and as the county prospers, sc\nwill prosper the town. And it is universally admitted that\nthe greatest single factor in developing the country is\ngood roads.\nA million and a half dollars is to be spent for perma\nnent highways. The mam concern will be to get results\nsee that none of the money is squandered and that the peo\npie secure what they voted for. To this end, they will\nlook to the county court and the advisory committee it has\nnamed.\nIt would be folly to attempt highway construction\nwithout a skilled road builder to supervise and superin\ntend. As Jackson county has led the state in voting for\ngood roads so must she lead in actual construction.\nNo matter what a skilled road builder costs, he will\nsave many times his salary in actual results. Tt was the\nfear that themoney would be frittered away in poor con\nstruction aid indiscriminate purchase of road machinery\nand wasted in various leaks that prevented the bonds from\ncarrying unanimously.\nMedford, Ashland and Central Point have all secured\ngood results in city improvement. There is no reason why\nthe county should not secure equally good results, even\nthough road building requires more knowledge, skill and\nscience than the laying of pavement.\nThe entire county owes a debt of gratitude to the little\nbaud of -workers\' who spread the good roads gospel. They\nsacrificed their time and money freely to the cause actu\nated solely by good citizenship. It is this spirit of co-operative\naltruism that is the strongest asset of any community\nan4 explains lpuder.fhan words can, the progrcssiveness of\nJackson county.\nDEW \'SUNSET\'\nTRAINS BEAM\nL\nSouthern PaacHlc-Sunsct Route Will\nCut Time Between New Orleans\naand Sail Francisco Thirty Hours\nand Connect Will) Steamships.\nBONFIRE RESPONSIBLE\nFOR LOSS OF BARN\nFOUR nt -\nSNOW AT LAKE\n!\'.
