According ti\nto Washington dispatches, the railroad managements are pre- b<\nparing for another raid on the public treasury, and this in the\nface of the fact that their failure to earn the 6 per cent rate\nis a public confession of inefficiency. It will be remembered\nthat the proponents of the Esch-Cumlinins bill insisted with a tl\nunanimity truly remarkable, that all the troubles of-the car\nriers arose from. the fact that they were and had been:under\ngovernment control. Once the roads were returned to the cap\ntains of industry,, said the lobbyists;-on the floor ana in the\nlobbys-the financial problems of the roads would be solved\nwith that well-known constructive ability for which captains of\nindustry are fianous. It now appears, however, that the exe\ncutives of th\'e railways have been unable to fulfill their glow- C\ning promises and the businessmen who object to"governmentin\nbusiness" and insist on "business in government," are asking q\nthat in accordance with the provisions of the Esch-Cummins\nbill, the government make. up their deficits out of the public u\ntreasury.\nIt seems that in the month of September, the roads only came\nwithin $29,000,000 of earnin;g their 6 per cent; in October\nthey were $20,000,000 short and while the reports for the 1\nsubsequeit\' months are not yet compiled, it is admitted that\nthese will also show deficits.\nIt. is said that the roads, with wonderful forbearance, will v\nnot ask for increased rates. \' They already have the highest\nfreight and passenger rates in history and the public protest r\nthat still arises over the granting of recent increases may have\nsomething to do with their timid attitude. They are not with\nout hope, however. Congressman Esch, one of the sponsors of\nthe bill, comes forward with the suggestion that under- the pro\nvisions of the act it is mandatory upon the interstate commerce\ncommission to grant increases that will allow the railroads to\nmake up their deficit whether the reads ask for a raise or not.\nWorkingmen. who suffer from the high cost of living aUd\nwhose family budget shows a deficit on Saturday night, will\nplease notice that the railroads do not even have to ask for an\nincrease in income, but that a beneficient government stands\nready to make up any discrepancy between income and ex\npense. It is in little matters of this kind that the railroad m\'ag\nnates differ from the men who really run the roads-the rail\nway employes.\nIt is well to remark here, since the pitiable plight of the rail\n,rads calls it to mind, that. when the Esch-Cummins bill was\nbefore congress, disgruntled representatives of labor stated\nShat the capitalization of the roads-$19,000,000,000--was\nabout $8,000,000,000 in excess of their actual value and that\ni\' was impossible for the roads to earn 6 per cent interest on\nthat immense sum. These throwers of monkey wrenches into\nthe legislative machinery were howled down by the kept press\nn(d the propaganda bureaus of the railroads and the Each\nCummins bill was passed amid much rejoicing. The result is\nas outlined above.\nThere is not much doubt that \'congress will give the roads\'\nwhatever thdy want. It would not surprise us if-a representa\nlive of the railroads was put in charge of the treasury with in\nstructions to pay out whatever sums the railway executives de\nmand in order to save them the embarrassment of appeariing\nbefore\'c .\'hgi\'es andm exposing their poverty to the unfeeling\ngaze of th&.cbarte, workers who can never understand that the\nrailroads tiife the arteries of the nation and that their wants\nmust be carefully attended to, even though it costs us several\ntimes what. it is worth. It should also le remembered that\nrailroad investors can now l)uy foreign bonds bearing 8 per\ncent intfcs t ki.aid betler, and that unless they are able to get\nmiore than 6 per cent from railroad securities, they may with\ndraw their funds and leave us only the rolling stuck, the road\nlieds and ottier equipnment which is operated and cared for by\nthe workers. iOf course, without thi stockhollders, the raill\nroads would ccase -to be oCf any use. In view of this faict, it is\nprobable that congress will take steps to increase the income\nof the roads in ord\'er that the railway empl:oycs nm..--continue\nto have jobs. If this iiecessitates another increase in frcight\nrates, we must bear the burden cheerfully knowing as good\nAmericans that dividends comenic firstl.\nCurrent Cant\n\'\' ]ortunes were made on every hand. A wave or-wealth\nswept over the country.

The\nII voice of every imperialist statesman, on the side of the allies,\nhas been raised in behalf of sufFerinug Armenia. The Turk has\nreceived condemnation, of a worse kind, than that ever re\nceived by the Germans.

Why should the French grow enthusiastic t\nin their love for the Armenians and cruelly oppress\' the \'Al\nSgerians? C\nBritain is faced..with a problem in the\' East -that can only\nbe settled by the use of brute force. The far Eastern races are\nwaking up to the fact that the -Workers\' Republic of Russia has\nmore to offer them than the imperialist government of Great\nBritain. That is why the four trans-Caucasian\' states-Ar\nnienia, Kurdistan, Azberaijan \'and Georgia are passing over to\nthe Bolsheviki, why Anatolia, from Erzerumn to Smyrna, is ruled\n,by a Turkish.rebel\', who has expressed his -s\'mpathy and support\nwith: the Bolsheviks; why Greece, disgusted with the policy\nthat was pursued by Veniezeleos, has turned front the allied\n(aurise to the cause of the struggling raccs of.the far East. This\ncoumplete: change of policy in the far East is undermining the\nasrule of Britain. No amount of reasoning will swing the far\nEastern races from their present point of view. Ifithey retain\nat their point of view then the British empireeis faced with internal\nto disaster. It therefore becomes necessary for.EEngland to in\ncrease -her naval and. military\' strength, in order to make the\ns far East safe for British democracy---which:means in world wai\nparlance-trade. The Frenich with the rise of Turkey are with\nout the necessary means of attacking Russia and forciiig Lenine\nds to pay the late Czar\'s debts of $1,500,000,000. Britain also\nwould like to use Turkey, in order thatt she might ietaiin \'con\na- trol of Mesopotainia. The present Turkish government will\nn- be fought and a new Turkey might be crecated to serve the aims\nof France and Britain.

In the\nUnited States,. gold production, al\nS though constantly diminishing, has\nbeen kept up to present figures\'large\nY :through the operation of gold\n? dredges, which extract the.grans\' of\nr gold\'from lamds incapable of. being\nprofitabl\' mined by other methods.:\ne The gold output of the world seems\nC to have passed its. zenith and to be\non the decline. Existing, ore bodies\n-are being worked out and few new\'\nore bodies of importance have been\nadded -to the gold and silver produc\nY ers in recent years. Much of the gold\ne now produced 1s taken from low\ngrade oreg that are profitably \'worked\nonly because of the improved tech\nti nique in mining and metallurgy de\nveloped by engineers. The yields and\'\ncosts vary in different districts and\n.0 in different mines .in each district.\nd The. greatest . gold producers have\'\nbeen rines ,of loW or moderatelyteld\nit per toi,, but with great mass occur\n, rence and good conditions for .eco\nnomicril working. For example, the\nd Hmestake Smine in South Dakota,\nis which has been working, since 1875\nand has produced\'over $147,000,000;.\n1e \'has operated entirely in lowrgrade\ntr ore averaging not over $4 per tori;\nand yet,this mine has made a profit\nb of over $40,000,05\'0, or 27 per cent\nal of its outpht. Another famous mine,\nthat of Alaska Treadwell group iii\n1- Alaska, has crushed and treated 26,\n1le: 00,000 tons of ore, yielding $63,\n000,000, or $2.37 per ton, and at a\ncost of $1.42 per ton. Another Alas\n1- ka mine is reported to have worked\n1C over 2,000,000 tons of ore giving a\nyield of less than $1 per ton, and yet\nSO made a profit, but this is only pos\n= sible bya combination of unusually\nfavorable natural conditions and a\nill most efficient organization backed by\nk ample caoital.\nSince the beginning of gold miningi\nin the Witwatersrand district, South\nAfrica, in 1887, there has been pro\nluced there a total of $2,571,992,355\nwith a gross profit of over $600,000,\n000, but while production is holding\nup pretty \'well in this district there is\nno present likelihood of developing!\nnew and unknown aeposits; and a!\nsteady decline is looked for in "thie\nAfrlcan fields.\nAustralia reached the maximum Of\'\nits .production in 1903, when $87,\n000,000 in gold was mined, but since\'\nthen it has gradually declined, until\nin 1916 the returns were only aboit\n$39,000,000.

The same, story is told\nof all other gold-producing countries,\nincluding the United zStates, for in\n1919 the world produced but:\'$350,\n000.000 in gold-$31,000,000 or 8.1\nper cent. loss than for the precetling\nyear. , With this loss for 1919, the\ntotal amount of tihe decline in the\nworld\'s gold production for the past\nfour years was $119,000,000 or over\n25 percent.\nThe United States has been,. prob1\n"ably, the largest gold-producing coun\nlry on earth, for up to 1917 it had\nmined a lotal -of.$3,91.2,708,000. In\n1915 it produced ov.,r $101,000,000,\n\'but In the following years-it has grad\nually declined in production until In\n\'918 the gold amounted to only $68,\n646,700. There are six states and the\nterritory of Alaska that\' have for the\nlast six years produced approximatelyl\nt0 per cent of tho gold of this coun\ntry.. They are, in .the, o\'dler of their\nproduction, California, Colorado,\n\'A\'laska, Nevada,, South Dakota, Arl\nzona and \'Montana. For the last two\nyears all of these states nave showni\nmarked declines In the. amount or\ngold produced, atid the idde or quartzal\n\'mines have shown the greatest falling\noff, largely due to the increased cost\nof mining, compared with *the fixed\nvalue of the gold recovered. Ca.L.,I\nfornia and Alaska have maintained\n\'their output largely through the Oi~\n,\'ation-of gold dredges, which, though\nfeeling the effects of the lacnrease\'\ncost, of production, had, to keel\' pep\nating on account of the maintoec.\'e\nof their organizations and the idu-i\nreet .loss that would b stahI$Z\nclosing5 4own, Ti re pa c\nf d4ec1t1 in kold mining in,-this d\ncotditi aTr.&the high whages, the de- Ei\ndreased :effilentcy of that labor and ex\n\'th; great:lficrease gn the cost\' of sup- tr\nplies- :,Sinrde the o.tbreait of the war, be\nprices of "-:all cofnixodities have ir- fr\ncreased greatly except tlhat of gold, ki\nwl~ih as ths standard of value is be\nfixed .I $20.67 per ounce.

Under the ciictimstances t)\nmany times have been compelled to h;\nclose and await more favorable con- tl\nditions. Those\' mines that have con- hi\nthiued"operations have been able to B\ndo so only by practicing the most ei\nrigid economies and by the curtail- w\nment of development work. The in- o\ncreased freight rates alhd car short- w\nage have seriously interfered with 4\nthe production of those mines com- 1\npelled to traffsport their ore by rail\nroad to distant smelters, and in the\ncase of the dredging companies in U\nCalifornia and Oregon the shortage of\nelectric power has been so great that\nthey were compelled to suspend oper\nations entirely for several months in\nthe summer or "dry" season, or else\nto operate under a decreased sched\nle, which raised their operating costs\nto a point where it was f0e longer\npossible to mine at a profit. Many\ndredges have been started in districts\nwhere the successful operation of, the\nboat depends primarily on low run\nning costs, and a large yardage, for\nthere is only\':a.cortain value in each\ncubic yard of gravel and it must be\nextracted at a cost below that value\nSf-a loss is not to be sustained. The\nSadding of a cent or two 4o the cost\nSof handling a cubic yard of gravel\noften wipes out the margin of profit.\nMany of the sOiTaller dredging com\npanies found it necessary to shut\ndown their operations, but the big\n, ones, running a number of ,boats,\nSfind it so necessary to keep their\ntriinled menu together that they can\n, aot afford to suspend, and these conm\npanies have continued producing gold\nat the expense of greatly diminished\nirofits.\neTo meet the situation confronting\nthe gold miners in the United States\na num.nber of suggestions have been\nmade for protecting them against\n\'adverse economic co4ditions. It has\nif been tsuggested that a bonus per\ng ounce be given to- gold producers un\ntil such time as economic conditions\ns will return to normal. The Ameri\ncan .Mining congress and many other\nigpublic organizations have adopted res\npv lutions calling upon the government\nn to pass some legislation favorable to\nthe mining industry, but to date these\nd plans have not passed beyond the\n, talling stage.\nd In connection with the suggested\nbonus on gold it is interesting to note\nthat the same subject is being\nd biought to the attention of the au\nd thorities in South Africa and Aus\ntralia, and is now under discussion\nin England. The British government\ntI hate appointed a. committee of experts\nto make a sweeping inquiry into the\no conditions at\' gold, mines and to sug\nge Rest.possible measures of relief. Es\npecial attention is being given the de\nsirability of granting the demands of\n. the gold producers for a revision of\nthe selling price of their product to\ncompensate for the\'increased cost of\n\'it labor and supplies, to means of en\nit couraging the mininig of low-grade\nores, and of stimulating the produc\ntion of gold in general. According to\na statement issued by the Chairman\nof the Transvaal Chamber of Mines,\nout of 46 companies operating in uthe\nTransvaal, \'6 were running at a loss\nand 15 were barely paying expenses.\nand it is said that a large\'inumber of\nt the mines on the Rand will have to\nshut down unless given some relief.\nScientific American.\nBIRTH CONTROL\n(Continued from Pago One.).\nis likely to produce. an outburst of\nthe same nature as the European\nstruggle that-in four years laid a\nworld in ruiu.

Two other : guards\nwere arrested Thursday at 568\nBroadway on a similar charge and\nheld on $500 bail each.\nAt the Manufacturers\' Industrial\nassociation. 673 Broadway, .it was\nadmitted that the five men in the\nTombs were employes, of theirs\nwhom they had sent to "guard" the\nshops under contracts with the\nClothing Manufacturers\' association.\nAn official of the association stated\nthat his organization had made\ncontracts with the Clothing Mlanu\nfacturers\' association for the \'fguard\ning" of 10 shops. The Manufac\nturers\' Industrial association re\nvealed itself in a letter turned\nover to the Amalgamated by\na friendly manufacturer to be a\nprofessional strike-breaking organ\nization, supplying non-union workers\nfor the inside of the shop and ex\npolicemen as guards for the out\nside.\nConfirmation of the union\'s claim\nthat the New York lock-out is ,oly\nthe beginning of a general attempt\nto crush out the union, came with\nthe issuance of an ultimatum by the\nBoston clothing manufacturers, \'af\nfecting the whole market, or 6,500\nworkers. The announcement breaks\ndff\' all relations with the union,\nand on Jan. I initiates a 22/ per\ncent decrease in wages and the uni\nversal installation of piece-work.\nThis wage reduction is exactly as\nthat forced upon textile workers\nin New England. The Boston shops\nwill be closed and will not be re\nopened except under the new con\nditions, the announcement stated.\nOfficials of the union here held\nan executive conference on the\nsituation, the result of which has\nnot yet been announced.\n\'Meanwhile, they have issued an\n\'"open letter to the puiblic" which\ndeals with the present clothing situ\nation. The letter, which is signed\nby Hillman and by Joseph SoIhloss\nberg, general secretary-treasurer,\ndeclares that what the clothing man\ntifacturers are trying to produce is\n"not clothes, but chaos." The lock\nut against the union is directed\nagainst the public quite as much as\nagainst the workei\'s, says the state\nment, which goes on:\n"By instituting,a lock-out in New\nYork, by trying to extend that lock\nout to other markets, the manufac\nturers aim to create a shortage,\nunload stocks at a high figure,\nmaintain profiteering and, if pos\nsible, unload the blause on labor.\n"Right now there are millions of\nyards of cloth uncut, there are\nemissaries from New York working\nin other cities to instigate lock-outs,\nthere are meetings of manufacturers\nfor deviuing ways of preventing\nproduction."\nThe statement concludes with the\nassurance that the union will try\nto block the promulgation of low\nwages and demoralization, and will\nalso try to prevent lock-outs in\nother cities, and concludes: . "Mean\nwhile, the-public is warned of the\nconsequences to clothing prices\nwhich will follow the manufacturers\'\nacts. What does the public propose\nto do about it?"\nStatistical nupport to this argu\nment is given In a report issued by\nthe research department of thie un\nion today which explodes tie claim\nof the New York manufacturers\nthat they canniot compete. with btheir\nclothing markefs, and shows that\nwhat the manufactures are really\nafter is the retention of their wvar\ntime pyramiding of profits.\nS"Thoughout the year 1919, when\nthe prices of smen\'s clothes experi\ne-ced their most striking increases,\nthe manufacturers in the\'New Yprk\nmarket, in striking contrtst to the\npolicy iu the other markets, took\nthe mosit unscrupulous daryautagc\nby constantly\' raising the price of\ntheir product," says the report.\n"These prices were determined in\n-reality by what,.. le trflic. was wiJ\nling to bear,: gnd not ait- all by\n--ages."-- - *- -\nI S~\noo-t9~R#re\nTHE, E.,.ca~i~ n\n406 1iBt\'s~ ~ ·~~~f~;\nMEETING\nTOQNIGHT r\nDecember 30th\nImportant Business\nSchilling\'s Hall\n:BUY YOUR WANTS AT THE\nGALAXY DRUG\nEverything at Reduced Prices. 843 EAST PARK\nCUT RATE DRUG STORE\n(Paid Adyertisement.)\n\' \' . . o\nMINISTER ASKS\nAN IPORTA\n"How Much Is Public Opin\nion Worth," Asks Mem\nber of the Interchurch\nCommittee.\n(Special to The Bulletin.)\nNew York. Dec. 30.---"How much\nis public opinion worth?" asks the\nRev. Daniel A. Poling, vice chair\nman of the steel strike inquiry coms\nmission, financed by the interchurch\nworld movement, writing in the cur\nrent issue of the New Republic.\n"It is over four months now."\nwrites Mr. Poling, "since the pub\nlication of the interchurch repolrt\non the steel strike, with its\'cou\ndeumnation of the autocratically en\nforced two-shift system iu steel\nplants. Recently other waves of\npublic criticism have broken against\nthe 12-hour day, one started by\nsoaieties of engineers, the other by\nthe Lockwood committee\'s investi\ngation.\n"Not for the purpose of boasting\nbut as a matter of record, we would\ncite tile verdicts of authorities and\npublic bodies in America and in\nEurope, the book itself bou~ght by\nthousands of readers in every state.\nits use in the colleges, also in\nchurches, its widespread discussion\nin the press and in forums.

It has\nnot drawn any reply fromn the ac\ncepted spokesmen of the United\nStates Steel corporation, except one.\nIt has not disturbed the 12-hour\nday.\n"It is 10 years since \'public opin\nion\' began to break against the 12\nhoutr day. With the recent history\nthese questions are raised: How\nmuch are certain sogial forces really\nworth?

Are we to infer that a\nmain reason for not granting the\nchange is the fear" that it may re\ndound to the furtlerance of the\nunions?\n"Far over 100,000 workers still\nrise-in the dark, work 12 hours, go\nhome in the dark, isolated in steel\nplants from family and nation.
