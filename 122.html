H. Smith, who, on account of\nhis splendid work on behalf of the\nboys\' corn club movement in Mis\nsissippi, has earned the sobriquet,\n"Corn Club" Smith, by which he\nis known far and wide. Prof.\nSmith always has some new and\nvaluable information to impart to\nhis hearers, and his address yes\nterday was pregnant with interest\nand was listened to with close at\ntention. In addition to Prof. Smith\'s ad\ndress there was a fine talk by\nProf. C. A. Cobb of the A. and M.\nCollege, another man who has ac\ncomplished splendid results in his\nwork in behalf of the youthful\ncorn growers.\nShort addresses were delivered\nby Prof. Hull and others, and the\nmeeting was altogether a most\ninteresting one.\nMr. and Mrs. C.

Miss\nMobley, who is rather pretty, is\nreally nothing but a child, and\nappeared on the stand attired in\na neat white dress which struck\nher just below her knees. She\nstated that she left a country\nchurch in the Steens neighbor\nhood with Shelton and a b\nnamed Millard Green on the af\nternoon of Sunday, August 3rd.\nThe trio came to Columbus in a\nbuggy, and Millard Green re\nturned immediately to his home,\ntaking the horse and buggy with\nhim. The witness said that she\nand Shelton went to the Mobile\n& Ohio depot, and walked from\nthere to a secluded spot near the\nTombigbee river, where he took\nadvantage of her.\nThe girl stated that after leav\ning the river she and Shelton re\nturned to the depot, where both\nboarded an outgoing train. Shel\nton, however, left the train be\nfore it pulled out of the yards.\nAfter she found that fihe had\nbeen deserted the girl explained\nher plight to a kind-hearted !pas\nsenger, who furnished her with\nmoney to buy a ticket back to\nColumbus. She returned here\nthat night and went to the Com\nmercial Hotel, where she remain\ned until the following day when\nshe went home.\nThe testimony of Miss Mobley\nwas corroborated byMattie Fow\nler, a chambermaid at the Com\nmercial Hotel, who swore that\nthe girl told her the circumstan\nces of her betrayal.\nShelton was placed on the\nstand in his on behalf, and told\nSoractically the same tale as that\ntold by the girl, the only discre\npancy being that he claimed her\nruin was not accomplished\nthrough force.\nCouple Get Married.\nThe case reached an unexpected\nclimax yesterday afternoon, Jwhen\nShelton and Miss Mobley were\nmarried at the court house, the\nceremony having been performed\nby Rev. E. M. Younghance.\nThe marriage does not legally\nfree Shtltou from the crime with\nwhich he i3 charged, and when the\ngrand jury meet3 next month it\nwill be incumbent upon its mem\nbers to investigate the case. It is\nprobable however, that as he has\nwedded the girl and she seems to\nbe satisfied, no indictment will be\nreturned.\nChocolate, strawberry, rherry\nsherry, caramel nut, and vanilla\ncream, and grape sherbert today.\nPremium Ice Cream Co, Phone 41\n( Mrs. W.

Flynn announced his\nattention of occupying the exe\ncutive chamber. Friends ot Sul\nzer declared he intended to stick\ntight and that the assembly had\nnot the constitutional right to\nconsider impeachment at this ex\ntraordinary session.\nSome declared Sulzer would\norder out troops to prevent the\nlieutenant-governor from taking\nthe seat. The governor is silent.\nAsked, when he left the office\nthis evening, where he spent the\nday, if he intended returning to\nmorrow, he said:\n"Yes, Sir-ee," and he replied\nin angry tones.\nThere is every indication of a\nclash between the two claimants\ntomorrow when both appear at\nthe capitol. Senate and assem\nbly members declared that Sulzer\nwas out automatically when the\narticles of impeachment were\npresented. Nevertheless the\ngovernor was not molested today.\nIt is virtually certain that the\ngovernor and lieutenant-governor\nwill resort to legal tests.\nIt is not thought that Sulzer \'a\nwife will give out a statement\ndetailing the use of campaign\nmoney to buy stocks until the\ntrial.\nIt is declared that her testimo\nny will go far toward clearing\nthe governor of the charges.\nMr. and Mrs. E.

The distance be\ntween Meridian and Columbus is just a little more\nthan ninety miles, and if our people will only ex\ntend him an invitation and insist upon its accept\nance he can undoubtedly be induced to come here.\nThe date of the president\'s contemplated visit\nto Mobile is only a little more than two months\ndistance, and if he is to be persuaded to come here\nno further time must be lost. The invitation\nshould be extended at once, for after the official\nitinerary ha3 once been decided upon it is not likely\nto be changed.\njwany ciuea anu iuwms ure uniting iu ue muuu\ned in the itinerary of the proposed Southern trip,\nand some of our citizens seem to think that it\nwould be a vain hope to expect President Wilson\nto come here when so many invitation, are being\npressed upon him by larger places. The same\npinion was advanced, however, when a movement\nwas started here four years ago to induce Presidnet\nTaf t to visit us, but those at the head of the mvoe\nment persisted in their efforts, which were ulti\nmately crowned with the most gratifying success,\nthe coming of Mr. Taft having been an event that\nwill long stand out prominently in local history.\nThere is more reason to hope for a visit from\nPresident Wilson than there was to expect one\nfrom President Taf t, for Mr. Wilson 1j not only a\nDemocrat but a Southerner, and will, it is belived,\nbe more than willing to do any thing possible to\nplease his Southern constituents.\nLet\'s get together and make a concerted effort\nto induce President Wilson to come here. We can\ndo it, and his visit would not only bring much\npleasure to our citizens but would be a big adver\ntisement for Columbus.\n-5 Per. .; tD t: VV: ; CLA. :: i:.: aiyi:i:ti?k;g\nThrt3 13 Fcur Crops cf Hay KATES One cent a word per\nr,,u vi"n V 1 f"l E?L ! iue- N- adm-tisercer.t taken\n: the nrst time.\n- .i\n. t f\nIA V V .\n5 .\nI 1 i .\nAt Ileduced Prices\nGUARDIANS FOR INCORRIGIBLE?.\nThere is a movement on foot to have the leg\nislature at its next session pass a bill providing for\nthe establishment of a State juvenile reformatory,\nand while there is urgent need that some provision\nbe made for the care of incorrigible children of Mis\nsissippi, it is doubtful if the redemption of thes\nchildren, which is the end in view, C3n be accom\nplished through the establishment of a reformatory.\nIncorrigible children are generally possessed\nof vicious natures, and it is a well established fact\nthat when a large number of these adolescents are\nsubjected to the close contact which a reformatory\nforces upon them their vicious instincts are\ndeveloped rather than subdued. Their moral en\nvironment is sordid rather than salutary, and as.a\nconsequence some of the most hardened criminals\nthat the world has ever produced have come out of\nthese so-called reformatories.\nIllinois, which State has had juvenile reform\natories for many years, has become convinced that\nthis system of reclaming delinquent children is not\na success, and it has been practically abandoned.\nInstead of a reformatory, each county in Illinois\nnow has an official called a public guardian whose\nduty it is to take charge of all recalcitrant chil\ndren, and endeavor to rescue them from the paths\nof sin. Instead of placing the children in one large\ninstitution, where they come in contact with other\nchildren who are morally deficient, they are placed\nin private homes, where they work for their board\nand clothes and the environment is far more sal-\nuarj.\nThe plan outlined above is far less expensive\nthan a reformatory and is at the same time much\nmore effective, The children.instead of associating\nwith boys and girls as morally deficient as them\nselves, are thrown with honest, God-fearing peo\nple, and often grow up to be useful men and wo\nmen.\nWe are impressed with the fact that Mississip\npi should profit by the example of Illinois, and,\ninstead of establishing a state reformatory, adopt\nthe plan outlined above for rescuing incorrigible\nchildren.\nEXCELS EVERY OTHER CH\nfor less than\nThe Introduction of Alfalfa at a Gen\neral Farm Crcp In the United Statee\nWill Revolutionize Agriculture\nMeant More Live Stock, Better\nSoli and Larger Returnt From\nthe Crept That Follow. -\nBy PROF.

Impeachment proceed\ning followed Sulzer\'s action in submitting a fal\nsified report of the money subscribed by his sup\nporters for campaign expenses and the manner in\nwhich this money was disbursed.\nThe laws of the state of New York provide j lookout for tlu-so tripping, trotting rhythms.

On the same day thpy have been assailed by\na prelate in Cincinnati, who denounces them as\nbad for the soul, and a chiropodist in New York,\nwho pronounces them as mo?t fatal to the feet\nAlso, the ominous clicking of a typewriter in the\ncity hall indicates that another assault is coming\nfrom Mayor Gaynor, who will obliterate the tango\nteaeries from the map. To be sure, Miss St. Denis\nsprings to their defense with the statement that\nthey are graceful and expressive of emotion the\ntemperature of said emotion depending wholly on\nthe dancers themseves. Nevertheless, it\'s a sad\nmit an itemized statement of all campaign contri\nbutions and expenditures, and it was proven that\nSulzer not only failed to include in his report all\nmoney that was subscribed but spent a large\namount of the money donated for campaign expen\nses gambling on the stock exchange.\nAfter it was shown that he had failed to ac\ncount for several thousand dollar?, Sulzer, as a\nmeans of last resort, had some of his friends to\nstart a rumor to the effect that the money had been\ngambled away by his wife without his knowledge\nor consent This statement was false on its face,\nrefuge only in every dancing place in this country\nand have invaded England and the Continent in\nsearch of more places to hide their diminished\nheads-or should it be feet?

The unromatic; the inglorious side\nof war is here revealed. Three thousand maimed\nRepeated expeimenta made by the\nagricultural .colleges, and the results\nobtained by the actual growers of al\nfalfa in the semi-arid sections of the\nwest, throughout the corn belt states,\nand In the south and east, are conclu\nsive evidence of the great value of\nalfalfa.\nThere are few farmers whose profits\nwould not be increased greatly by rais\ning alfalfa. Every farmer should altn\nto produce, as far as possible, his\nfoodstuffs upon his own farm.\nDuring the last few years, the area\ndevoted to alfalfa has greatly in\ncreased tn the region west of the Mis\nsouri river, and it is certuin that\nthere will be an equally rapid in\ncrease throughout the enBtern and\nsouthern parts of the United States\nMany of the attempts in tho past\nto grow alfalfa in tho humid regions\nhave failed, but with our present\nknowledge of the requirements of tho\ncrop there will be littl, if any, more\ntrouble in securing a Bland.\nAlfalfa will soon be grown ebun\ndantly and profitably upon every farm.\nIt is no more difficult to grow than\nclover and gives double the yield. Tho\ndeep rooting habit of alfalfa enables\nit to resist drouth when clover, tira\nothy, blue grast and other forage\ngrasses die for vant of mointuro. Al\nfalfa roots grow deep into the noil-\nfar beyond the roots of other plants.\nIts drouth resisting power is of no\ngreater Importance than . itB great\nvalue as a soil enrlcher. The loug\nroots bring phosphorus, potash and\nother plant foods from below and\nstore them in the upper soli for the\nuse of other plants. Experiments show\ngreatly increased yields of other crops\ngrown upon alfalfa sod.\nAlfalfa is rich in protein the moist\nessential element in feed to ninko\nbone, blood and muscle in growing ani\nmals.\nWhy We Need Alfalfa.\nThere is no combination of feeds\nso economical Jor the production of\nbeef, pork, mutton, butter and eggs\nas corn and alfalfa. Neither will give\nthe best results alone. We need alfal\nfa because it balances up the corn\nration and saves the large waste of\nBtarch which always takes place\nwhere corn is fed alone. We need\nalfalfa because we can by means of it\ngrow on our own farms the protein\nmore profitably than we can buy it iu\nfeed stuffs. We need alfalfa because\nit feeds the soil and enables us to\ngrow larger crops of corn and oats.\nWe need alfalfa because it productt\non an average double the feed value\nper acre of clover or any other forage\ncrop. j\nAdvisable to Inoculate.\nIn Regions wherb alfalfa has not\nbeen grown it is round to do neccs\nsaty to inoculate the ground by sow\ning three or four bass of soil secured\nFOR SALE Fine saddle mare,\n(1 years old.
