CALDWELL\nUKfULSSQBRfiflDaSRRBBSBESn\nFREIGHT RATES.\n(By L. M. Hewlt.)\nThe making and adjusting of freight\nrateg to govern charges for the trans\nportation of the farmers product to\nmarket and the furniBlilntt hi in with\nmerchandise from the manufacturing\ncenters of the country, is so little un\nderstood by the layman, that a com\nplete analysis of its method may prove\nof benefit, not only for the purpose of\nknowing how it Is done, but that we\nmay better appreciate the reason why.\ni Not so many years ago, etich railroad\ncompany by its general freight agent\nissued its own schedule of freight\nrates, making arbitrary charges for\ndifferent classes of freight, to supply\nits revenue according to Its iiossible\nneeds, without any regard to Its neigh\nbor railroad.\nf-ompelltion was warm and frequent\n"rate wars" were not only ruinous to\nthe participating railrnnds but demor\nalizing to the public\'s business. Mr.\nA would approach the general freight\nagent of the XYZ road and propose\nto ship 100 cars of cattle from Port\nWayne to Chicago if he was given a\nspecial rate, a cut of osslbly 3 to S\ncents per 100 pounds. Mr. General\nFreight Agent had the absolute au\nthority to make the sepcial rate and it\nwas then a perfectly legitimate trans\naction and the rate was made and the\nstock was shipped to market, (by the\nway, a transaction that would now re\nsult In sending both Mr. General\nFreight agent and Mr. Shipper to the\npenitentiary.) At that time, 25 years\nago, the only result was to precipitate\na general cut on rate of shipping cat\n..e to Chicago and soon resulted in\nsuch a rata war that the great freight\ncarrying roads of the entire central\nnorth were carrying all vkinda of\nfreight at one half the actual expense.\nIt caused such an uncertainty aa to\nthe carrying charges, that all business\npractically at a standstill, to such\nthat merchant, farmer and\nace. The railroads\n.the evM by\nlut dls-\nclared unconstitutional. Then came\ncongress with an interstate commerce\ncommission act, and an anti-trust act,\nand the outgrowth ot all the remedial\nmeasures, with the co-operation of the\nrailroads themselves, In the present\nsystem of freight rate making.\nThe present system consists mainly\nof thrH gTeat traffic committees,\neastern, central and western, under\nthe supervision of the three traffic\nassociations, with the concurrence of\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission\non all interstate business and the state\nrailroad commission on all state traf-\niflft.\nI This rate committee is made of men\nwho have distinguished ability as\n: freight rate experts and are taken\nlrom the great railroad systems all\nover the country, wnen the rates\nare to be revised for any particular\nsection of the country, the committee\nfor that particular section gives hear\nings to the heads of all the railroads\naffected by the revision. The presen\ntation of the needs of each railroad has\nto show its mileage, value, fixed ex\npenses, estimated operating expenses,\nestimated loss from all sources, taxes,\nand every legitimate charge. Also its\nestimated tonnage, its estimated gross\nIncome under the present schedule of\nrates, also its estimated loss of gain\nunder the projiosed schedule as re\nvised. Now it Is a fixed principle In\nbusiness and law that you cannot com\npel a railroad to submit to a reduc\ntion in charges for a service if the re\nduction will cause a net loss. Nor can\na railroad enforce an Increase for such\nservice If the fixed charge is shown\nto be reasonably profitable to the in\nvestment. Therefore, the committee,\nin conjunction with the railroad com\nmissions prove to be one great balance\nor evener between the shipper and the\ncarrier.\nIn Texas we have a minimum and a\nmaximum class rate fixed by the rail\nroad commission which is ten miles\nand less, first-class IS cents, second\nclass 12 cents, third-class 10 cents,\nfotuth-class 8 cents per 100 pounds,\nwith maximum of 250 miles and over\nfirst-class 80 cents, second class 72\nhlrd-class 60 cents, fourth-class\na much less charge on\nwill IN seen that\npaper than\nMer\nest losses are on short hauls caused\nby shippers\' carelessness In marking\nor packing Just because "its only go\ning a little way."\nThe different classes of freight is\narrived at by considering the value,\nbulk and hazard of the article.\nThere are hundreds of sheets of ex\nceptions" to established freight rates\nIssued every month by the rate com\nmittees. These "exceptions" are made\nIn this way: Mr. A is manufacturing\nan article of commerce at some point\nand he wants to market It at some\npoint in Texas, in competition with\nMr. B for some other state. Mr. B has\nan interstate rate which affords him\na profit to undersell Mr. A. The rail\nroad company wants Mr. A to sell bis\nproduct in sufficient quantity to make\nit a profitable tonnage and to assist\ni him in doing so it Joins Mr. A in a\npetition to the railroad commission to\nmake an "exception" of this particu\nlar article, from the official classifi\ncation. The commission grants the\nrequest and this "exception" is pub\nlished and furnished to every railroad\nagent in the state. This sometimes\ncauses confusion, but a careful rate\nclerk keps his "exceptions" tabulated\nso carefully that with few exceptions\nhe is "up-to-date.\nNow a word to shippers farm\nproducts. Nearly all farm products\nless a car load is second and third\nclass rate, but If shipped in car lots\nthere is a saving of fully 60 per cent\non freight alone. Again, the product\nwill reach market In much better con\ndition. This can be arranged by sev\neral farmers shipping together, under\none bill of lading.\nAgain, It can be done by the farm\ners\' organization arranging a shipping\nagent, which would prove of great val\nue to the entire county. Such an\nagency would be equipped with all the\nbatistical Information on rates, rout\ning! and packing and would prove of\nbenefit alike to farmer and merchant.\nAgain, Bryan has the same freight\nrates to and rom all the large cities\nthat Houston or Fort Worth have, giv\ning Bryan the game selling or buying\nadvantages as are enjoyed by either\nof the largest cities of Texas.\nMissing Children Found.\nWaco, Dec. 12.

The chuckwalla seeks to es\ncape his adversary by crawling Into a\ncrevice of a rock so narrow that It\nseems impossible to get blni out. But\nthe Indians have learned all his trli ks\nand how to circumvent them. To the\ndesert aborigine tho chuckwalla Is al\nluring. He feasts on the chuckwalla:\nhence he grows wise as to its habits.\nHo takes n piece of strong wire or a\nbent twig, and, poking It into the crev\nice, he taps the chuckwalla on the end\nof the nose. In a moment the angered\nreptile exhales a kind of hiss, tho\nnoise being made by a rapid expulsion\nof tho breath. As ho thus exhales he\nloses his hold on the rocks, and in a\nmoment the Indian pulls on his tail.\nAs speedily as a flash of lightning the\nchuckwalla Inhales again and tightens\nhimself In his recess.
