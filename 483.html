And the sound logic\nof the situation was never better illus\ntrated than in the practical sugges\ntions that were made at that meeting.\nIn the opinion of the Evening Teller\nthe free bridge movement launched at\nthat meeting was most timely and the\nconsummation of the project Is one\nof the probabilities of the near future.\nTwo great states are committed to the\nmovement by chief executives that will\nbe in charge of the legislatures in these\nstates at the convening of those bodies\nthe coming winter. Extensive busi\nness interests representing both the\nstates gave hearty support to the\nmovement in speeches made last night.\nA movement launched under such fa\nvotable circumstances is certain of\nbeing carried out to a happy consum\nmation.

Every loyal\ncitizen of the state should be so In\ntouch with local conditions as to be\nable at all times to advance the Idaho\nbanner. What we need for Idaho is a\npublicity campaign, not on the part of\na fixed committee only, but on the part\nof every citizen who has the interests\nof the state at heart. "Talk more\nabout Idaho at home and abroad," is\na good motto and one which Governor\nGooding seduously follows, setting the\nexample by his own action.\n♦ "THIS DATE IN HISTORY\n♦ October 9.\n1642—First commencement held at\nHarvard college.\n1760—City of Berlin taken by com\nbined Russian and Austrian forces.\n1781— Americans attacked Yorktown.\n1782— Lewis Cass.

He said\nthat since the accession to its presi\ndency of the present head of the uni\nversity it had greatly grown In\nstrength and favor wjth the people\nliving in the more remote parts of the\nstate, and they were now practically\nas Arm friends of It as the people of\nthe northern counties.\nThis compliment to Dr. MacLean\nwas fully appreciated by all who were\npresent and who know the good work\nthe doctor is doing.\n"Delicious- bread, did yeu sayt Of\ncourse. .

The deed\nis of record in the name of the North\nern Pacific company.

Some\nof our best cooks say that it makes as good bread as the pat\nents, so it does, but not quite so white.\nRemember, that we carefully test every lot of wheat that\nenters the mill, and use none but the best; selecting our wheat\nfrom the crop of Nez Perce and Asotin counties; we use only\nthe choicest from some five million bushels; we have the latest\nmachinery and the best of millers.
