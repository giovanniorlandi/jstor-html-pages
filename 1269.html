C.\nNovember 26, 1918.\nTo the American People:\nOne year ago twenty two million\nAmericans, by enrolling as members\nof the Red Cross at Christmas time,\nsent to the men who wore fighting\nour battle overseas a stimulating\nmessage of cheer that our people\nwere of their own free choice united\nwith their government in the determ?;\nination not only to wage war with the\ninstruments of destruction, but also\nby every means in their power to\nrepair the ravages of the invader and 1\nsustain and renew the spirit of the{\narmy and of the homes which th?*y\nrepresented. The friends of the Atner-j\nlean Ked Cross in Italy, Belgium, and\nFrance have told, and will tell again\nthe story of how the Red Cross work\'\ners restored morale in the hospitals,\nill the railinR and at Ihn nn.itnn.imiile\nand we ought to be very proud that\nwe have been permitted to be of s?r-|\nvice to those whose sufferings and\nwhose glory are the heritage of humanity.\nNow, by God\'s grace the Red Cross\nChristmas message of 1918 is to be a\nmessage of peace as well as a message\nof good will. But peace does not\nmean that we can fold our hands. It\nmeans further sacrifice. Our member\nship must hold together and be increased\nfor the great tasks to come.\nWe must prove conclusively to an a:tentlve\nworld that America is permanently\naroused to the nee;!s of the\nnew eiu, our old indifference gone\nforever.\nThe exact nature of the future service\nof the Red Cross will depend upon\nthe programme of the associated\ngovernments, but there is immediate\nneed today for every heartening w?rd\nand for every helpful service. We\nmust not forget that our soldier^ and\nour sailors are still under orders and\nstill have duties t0 perform of the\nhighest consequence and that the\nRed Cross Christmas membership\nmeans a great deal to them. The peoIII\nA A f .1 J ? 1 1 *\n,..v in*r auuuciifu iiiiius, moreover\nreturning home today where there\nare no homes must have the assurance\nthat the hearts of our people\nare with them in the dark and doubtful\ndays ahead. Let us, so far as we\ncan, help them back to faith in mercy\nand in future happiness.\nAa President of the Red Cross, conscious\nin this great hour of the value\nof suclr a message from the American\npeopla, I should he glad if every Americans\nwould join the Red Cross for\n1919, and thus send forth to the\nwhole human family the Christmas\ngreeting for which it waits and for\nwhich it stands in greatest need.\nWOOD ROW WILSON.\nNot a Deserter.\nIxitta, S.

Mr.\nMoore says the white coach was saved\nby its impact with the box car on the\nsiding. 11c is of the opinion that if\nthe box car had not been there til.\nwhite coach would have been badly\nwrecked and the fatalities would\nhave bee nmttch larger.\nThere was much confusion V?.Towing\nthe wreck.

S. 0., Nov. J,U. lb IX.\nMr. Skottowe Wannainuker, Pres.\nSouth Carolina Hankers Association,\nSt. Matthews, S. C.\nDear Sir:?\n1 desire tQ submit a suggestion to\ntne n> iiuu it tee or Fifteen, app \'tinted\nby the cotton growers of South Carolina\nat the meeting, held in Columbia\non the lXth inst., of which you\nare a member, and I wou\'d request\nthat you submii tliis suggestion t<>\nthis committee Tor its consideration\nand such action as it may determine\nupon.\nMy plans is that there be formed\na stock company with a capital of\nf.a.nno,000.00 divided into $fiotoou.oo\nshares each; and that this capital\nbe raised by selling the stock among\nthe farmers and business men through\nout each county, who are interested\nin sustaining the price of cotton. II\nthe farmers, who have cotton, and\nthose over the entire state, who art\nvirtually interested in stabliz.ng tin\nprice of cotton, would each subscribe\nfor a few shares, in proportion tt\ntheir respective interests, then\nshould be no trouble in raising thh\namount <-f cash capital. The fatthat\nsuch a company was formet\nfor the purpose of assisting and fi\nnaming the holders of cotton, to\ngcther with the borrowing capacity\nof such a large corporation, in my\nopinion, would prove a factor of very\ngreat strength.\nWe all know that there are ;\nlarge number of small farmers ant\nsome larger ones who, for one r?a\nson or other, will not withholi\ntheir cotton from the markets; am\nthis company could either assist am\nencourage thein in financing thei\nholding, or it could purchase the cot\nton direct at the prevailing marke\nprices. Certainly it would furnisl\nan additional market for those win\nmust or will sell, independent of th?\nspeculators.\nIt would also be necessary for ?\nsimilar movement to be undertake!\nby the cotton growers and business\nmen in every Southern s\'ate, and 1\nfeel satisfied that, if South Caroline\nwould lead in this proposition, ami\nif your committee would make steps\nto present it throughout the entirf\ncotton growing belt, there should bt\na good chance of the proposition being\ngenerally adopted. In sueli\nevent the present holders would\nhave the eituali n rbso\'u ely n theii\nbands, and we could demand ami get\ntin- prices we are entitled to re.eive.\nThe proposed capital stock of\nnOu.Oun.on will only amount tc\nabout M.i\'O per bale lor all the cot( >n\nraised in South Carolina, and\nwith the market fluctuation of more\nthan this amount per dav a! times.\nit scoins to imp that all of our furliiprs\nshou\'d hp willing 10 in\\pst tins\namount in an undertaking which\nwon (1 havp such vital iiil\'lupocp upon\nnot only thpir personal welfare,\nhut thp entire South.\n1 think that tin1 mere fart that tin\nfariuprs had determine 1 to form a\nc orpoi at ion for these piirpo;? w? uld\nl -tul to have a st-ahliz.ug pffpc-t upon\ntin- (Otton tuarkpt. and that almo\nt finna diatrly th?re w.\'iild h an\ni!(>w ird response in cotton prim s.\nT!ip ppoplp of South Carolina h ;ve\na\'t ..?!*- inveted in l".

But the\ninfluenza epidemic, causing 86.828\ndeaths in 44 large cities in eight\n; weeks, or an average of four of every\n1,000 of the population he added,\nhad brought a new element into the\nsituation.
