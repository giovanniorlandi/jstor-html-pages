Introduction\nIn Dutch, nominal compound formation is a very productive way of forming new\nwords. Between two nouns that form a compound a linking element may (1a,\x03b) or\nmay not (1c) occur. Often the linking element is homophonous with the plural\nending of the first noun, although this is not always the case, as for instance\nschaapskooi in (1b) indicates, the plural of schaap being schapen. The presence of a\nlinking element does not always correspond to an appropriate semantic context\neither (i.e. referring to plurality of the left-hand constituent), nor does the absence\nof a linking element always correspond to the singular meaning of the left-hand\nconstituent as shown in (1).\n(1) a. linking -en- (overall 11%, after derived nouns 32.8%)\nschapenpoot ‘leg of mutton’ (pl. schapen)\nhoerenjong ‘child of whore’ (pl. hoeren)\nboekenlegger ‘bookmark’ (pl. boeken)\nrijstepap1 ‘rice porridge’ (rijst is a sg. tantum)\nb. linking -s- (overall 25%, after derived nouns 62.7%)\nvarkenspoot ‘leg of pig’ (pl. varkens)\nschaapskooi ‘sheep fold’ (pl. schapen, *schaaps)\ntijdsdruk ‘time pressure’ (pl. tijden, *tijds)\nc. no linking element (overall 65%, after derived nouns 4.6%)\nschaapherder ‘shepherd’ (pl. schapen)\nburgeroorlog ‘civil war’ (pl. burgers)\nboekwinkel ‘book shop’ (pl. boeken)\nIn (1) the percentages of occurrence of the -en-, -s-, and Ø linking morpheme are\nbased on the CELEX lexical database (cf.

Van den Toorn 1981a,\x03b, 1982a,\x03b, Mattens 1987,\n95\n', '118 Anneke Neijt, Loes Krebbers and Paula Fikkert\n1990, and more recently Krott et al. 2001), this has not led to a unified account. It\n<LINK "nei-r4">\nis not completely understood why linking elements occur in schapenpoot and\nvarkenspoot, but not in kalkoenpoot, nor why the choice of a linking element\nsometimes is optional: both doelboom and doelenboom ‘target tree, goal scheme’\nexist, as do tijdbesparing and tijdsbesparing ‘time-saving’.2\nMattens (1970, 1984) claims that linking elements are suffixes that express\n5\n‘indifferentialis’, the generic meaning of nouns, which is also used in the phrase\nmensen zijn sterfelijk ‘men are mortal’ or de mens is sterfelijk ‘man is mortal’.\nSchreuder et al. (1998) show that in writing linking ·enÒ led to higher plurality\n8\nratings for the first constituent than ·eÒ. This suggests a closer relationship with\nnumber than Mattens’ indifferentialis would predict.\nTheAlgemene Nederlandse Spraakkunst (Haeseryn et al. 1997:683) presents the\n3\nfollowing description:3 “Originally, the linking elements were plural endings,\ngenitive case endings, word endings or mere transitional sounds for ease of articulation.\nThe present situation regarding linking elements in compounds is the result of\na development in which— over the centuries— genitive case was almost completely\nlost, words lost their endings, and several shifts occurred, particularly because of\nanalogy effects.”\nInspired by this description, Krott et al. (2001, and to appear a,\x03b) present a\nframework for accounting for the linking elements in Dutch compounds based on\nanalogy: New compounds most likely take the linking element that occurs in\nexisting compounds with the same left-hand constituent (either the whole constituent,\nits suffix, or its rime) or — although to a much lesser degree — with the same\nright-hand constituent. A consequence of the analogy hypothesis is that linking\nmorphemes that reflect the language’s history — for instance, because they are the\nhistorical traces of case endings that are no longer in use — can still play a role in\nthe minds of today’s language users and language learners. Without refuting this\npossibility, the present study examines the question whether other factors than\nanalogy may also play a role, in particular the semantics of the plurality of the lefthand\nconstituent of the compound and rhythm. Two experiments have been\nconducted to investigate the role of these two factors in production (both children\nand adults) and perception (adults only).\n2. Production experiment\nThe first experiment aims to investigate the role of rhythm and plural semantics in\nproduction, where we focused on the choice between Ø and -en- linking morphemes.4\nWith respect to the factor rhythm, we expected that if the left-hand\nconstituent ends in a stressed syllable and the right-hand constituent begins with a\nstressed syllable, the linking element -en- is favored to resolve the stress clash, as\n', 'Rhythm and semantics in the selection of linking elements 119\nshown in (2a),5 where a capital X stands for a stressed syllable, and a lower case x for\nan unstressed syllable.6 In all other contexts the insertion of the -en- linking element\nwill not improve the rhythmic structure of the compounds, and therefore is not\npredicted to occur for rhythmic reasons, as shown in (2b–c).\n(2) The factor rhythm\na. X – X Æ X -en- X\nb. X x – X Æ X x – X\nc. X – x X Æ X – x X\nWith respect to the factor plurality, we expected that in those cases where the lefthand\nconstituent is semantically plural, the linking element -en- is favored to\nexpress plural semantics. The strongest effect is expected in those cases where\nrhythm and plurality conspire, i.e. in cases where both rhythm and plurality favor\nthe -en- linking morpheme.\nFurthermore, as prosody is claimed to be acquired much earlier than plurality,\nwe expected that in children’s productions the factor rhythm would play a more\nimportant role than the factor plurality. Moreover, we expected the effects of both\nrhythm and plurality to be stronger in children than in adults, because the latter\nhavemore experience with data and hence will showmore analogy-based behavior.\n2.1 Method\nThree groups of participants took part in the experiment. The first group consisted\nof seven children aged 4 and five children aged 5. The second group consisted of six\nchildren aged 6 and seven children aged 7. Additionally, 6 adults, all above 21 years\nof age, took part in the experiment.\nIn order to ensure that the children were capable of forming plurals with -en,\nthey were asked to produce the plural form of the 12 words included as left-hand\nmembers in the compound experiment. It turned out that younger children (aged\n4 and 5) made some mistakes (respectively 17% and 8%), but the difference\nbetween the children was not significant (F(1,20)=0.14, p<0.05) and all children\ntook part in the experiment.\nThe test concerned an oral naming task. The participants first had to name two\npictures (e.g. boom ‘tree’, tomaat ‘tomato’ or tomaten ‘tomatoes’). The pictures were\ndrawn on transparent sheets, which could be placed on top of each other. This latter\nsituation led to the elicitation of a compound (e.g. a picture of a tree with one\ntomato or one with several tomatoes suggests tomaatboom or tomatenboom,\nrespectively). Importantly, the compounds were not real compounds in the\nlanguage, to avoid the possibility that reference was made to stored lexical representations.\nIn this way, a set of 25 pictures for 19 concepts was used to form all 24\ncompound test words.Most children completed the testwithin half an hour. The order\n', '120 Anneke Neijt, Loes Krebbers and Paula Fikkert\nof the test items was determined by the participants themselves to make the task as\nnatural as possible for them. Two children in the youngest group did not complete\nthe task. One of them was bilingual and not capable to form compounds, the other\nlacked concentration. The adults finished the experiment within five minutes.\nThe compounds in the test set constituted four groups, as indicated in (3). If\nthe picture denoted the plural form of the left-hand constituent of the compound\n(for instance a picture with several camels) the factor plurality would favor a plural\nform (+plural). If the two members of the compound would form a stress clash\nwithout the linking -en-, the factor rhythm would favor the linking -en- (+rhythm).\nThe compounds indicated as (+plural, +rhythm) would thus favor the -en- linking\nmorpheme both on semantic and on rhythmic grounds, as for instance in a\ntomátenbóom (where a picture of a tree with several tomatoes was shown).\n(3) a. +plural, +rhythm (both factors favor -en- responses):\ntomátenbóom, balónnenbóom, kamélenbóot, koníjnenbóot, ólifántensóep,\nbanánensóep.\nb. +plural, −rhythm:\nbanánenballón, tomátenballón, balónnenkoníjn, blóemenkoníjn,\nkamélengaráge, fíetsengaráge.\nc. −plural, +rhythm:\nkoníjnstáart, ólifántstáart, tomáatschíl, melóenschíl, ólifántógen, kaméelógen.\nd. −plural, −rhythm (both factors disfavor -en- responses):\ntomáatballón, banáanballón, ólifántgaráge, búsgaráge, pérzikschíl, áardbeischíl.\n2.2 Results\nThe results of the production test are presented in Table 1.\nWith a between-items logit analysis (Rietveld and van Hout 1993, Fienberg\n<LINK "nei-r7">2\n1980), the effect of the plural semantics, rhythm and age wasmeasured. As predicted,\nthere is an effect of plural semantics (F(1,65)=46.9, p<0.0001) and an effect of\nrhythm (F(1,65)=30.9, p<0.0001). The strongest effect is found in condition 1,\nwhere both rhythm and plural semantics favor the -en- linking element. Conversely,\nthe weakest effect is found in condition 4 where -en- is not favored on the basis of\nplurality or rhythm. Yet, it is remarkable that the linking -en- is still found in a\nconsiderable amount of the data. Secondly, the semantic factor (condition 1 and 2)\nleads to more -en- choices than rhythm (condition 1 and 3): 94% and 91%,\nrespectively (F(1,65)=4.7, p=0.03). Thirdly, age, i.e. the difference between the\nthree groups of participants is not significant (F(2,56)=2.4, p=0.10).\n2.3 Discussion\nWe hypothesized that rhythm and plural semantics would both trigger the choice\n', 'Rhythm and semantics in the selection of linking elements 121\nof linking -en- in nominal compounds. This hypothesis receives support from our\nTable 1.\x02Results of the naming task. In the ±plural condition a picture of a plural (+) or\nsingular (−) noun is presented.

We further hypothesized a larger effect of rhythm than of plurality in\nthe behavior of children, but this turned out not to be the case. That rhythm did not\nhave a larger effect than plural semantics may be due to the fact that these children\nhad both acquired prosody and plural morphology, and thus used both factors in\ndetermining the linkingmorpheme. It is very well possible that the visual presentation\nof plural information has a much larger impact than the factor rhythm.\nWe also expected that the factors plural semantics and rhythm would have a\nstronger effect on children’s productions than on adults’ productions, because\nadults were predicted to show more analogy-based behavior due to their larger\nlexical experience. We anticipated children to rely more on other strategies than\nanalogy because of their limited vocabularies. This prediction was not borne out:\nthere is no significant difference between the age groups. A possible explanation\nmay be, that the children that took part in the experiment are too old to show a\ndifference, and that their vocabularies are already large enough, i.e. contained a\nsubstantial amount of compounds, for analogy to play a role.\nIn a post-hoc analysis we also measured the effect of left- and right-hand\nconstituents. That is, based on CELEX (cf. Table 2) we investigated the effect of the\nleft- and right-hand constituent in the compounds used in the experiments.\n', '122 Anneke Neijt, Loes Krebbers and Paula Fikkert\nBoth left and right constituents were shown to have an effect (left:\nTable 2.\x02CELEX type frequency of linking elements (-s-, -en- or Ø) for the words used\nin the production experiment\nLeft-hand member Right-hand member\n-s- -en- Ø -s- -en- Ø\ntomaat\nfiets\nbus\naardbei\nbloem\nbanaan\nolifant\nkonijn\nballon\nkameel\nperzik\nmeloen\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\x026\n\x023\n\x020\n\x025\n24\n\x026\n\x020\n\x029\n\x020\n\x020\n\x020\n\x020\n\x020\n\x029\n12\n\x022\n21\n\x021\n\x020\n\x020\n\x023\n\x021\n\x023\n\x020\nboom\nboot\nsoep\nballon\nkonijn\ngarage\nstaart\nschil\noog\n\x02\x022\n141\n\x02\x021\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x024\n144\n\x02\x020\n\x0210\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x020\n\x02\x026\n\x02\x023\n\x02\x025\n\x026\n19\n17\n\x022\n\x022\n\x021\n\x023\n\x022\n12\nF(1,65)=21.5, p<0.0001, right: F(1,65)=3.9, p=0.0523). This leads to the conclusion\nthat analogy as well as the factors investigated in our experiment may explain\nthe outcome of the experiment. However, it is worth noting that the percentage of\nlinking -en- produced in our experiment is much higher than the percentage found\nin general (cf. the percentages given in (1)). We will return to this point in the\ngeneral discussion.\nIn order to test the effect of plural semantics and rhythm in the absence of a\npossible bias of the left- and right-hand constituent, we designed another experiment\nusing pseudo-words.\n3. Pseudo-word experiment\nThe pseudo-word experiment contained compounds formed on the basis of two\npseudo-words, and consisted of a comprehension and production task. Again, the\ntwo factors considered were rhythm and plural semantics. In the production task,\nparticipants were to chose a compound with -s- or with -en- (forced choice), where\nwe predicted that the participants would favor -en- if this would avoid a stress clash.\nIn the perception task, the participants had to judge the plurality of the first word\nin the compounds with linking -en- or -s- on a seven point scale, ranging from\nextremely singular (1) to extremely plural (7). Here, we predicted that if -en- was\nnot supported by rhythmic factors, i.e. was not used for clash avoidance, the\n', 'Rhythm and semantics in the selection of linking elements 123\nparticipants would be more likely to consider the first word of the compound high\non plurality. For -s-, rhythm was never a factor. However, -s- is more likely to be a\nplural after an unstressed syllable than after a stressed syllable.\n3.1 Method\n38 participants, young adults (e.g. first year students of Dutch and pupils in the\nfinal year of secondary school) took part in this experiment. The words were\npresented orthographically. The number of pseudo-words was kept small, in order\nto make the task short. For syllables ending in a single consonant digraph vowels\nwere chosen. If such syllables with digraph vowels are followed by linking -en- they\ndo not undergo the orthographic rule of vowel letter reduction: On the basis of\ngebriem and tijp the compounds gebriementijp and tijpengebriem are formed. On the\nother hand, if a geminate vowel letter had been chosen, linking -en- would have\ncaused vowel letter reduction: gebraam and toop would have resulted in the\ncompounds gebramentoop and topengebraam. Unlike geminate vowels, digraph\nvowels showmorpheme consistency in writing. We therefore chose digraph vowels\nto rule out the factor of morpheme consistency.\nIn the oral introduction of the task, most of the disyllabic pseudo-words\nincluded in the compounds were read aloud casually, in order to show their stress\npattern without drawing attention on this aspect of the task. The written introduction\ncontained no indication of the position of main stress, but the words were\nconstructed with frequently occurring unstressed first or final syllables (often\nderivational prefixes and suffixes): ge-, be-, ver-, ont-, -ik, -is, -uw, -ing. This\nguaranteed that the stress pattern of the pseudo-words was predictable on the basis\nof the visual representation.\nThe first part of the test focussed on form: does a stress clash trigger the choice\nof -en- in pseudo-compounds? The test set contained monosyllabic and disyllabic\npseudo-words which combined into 16 trisyllabic compounds, 8 with and 8 without\nstress clash:\n(4) a. pseudo-compounds with stress clash\ngebriemtijp, beloekpeeuw, verpeutzwink, ontmuipgarm\nbreunpruivik, morkbrosis, prautmeuluw, droukmoeling\nb. pseudo-compounds without stress clash\ngarmontmuip, zwinkverpeut, tijpgebriem, peeuwbeloek\nmoelingdrouk, pruivikbreun, meuluwknaut, brosismork\nThe participants had to choose between two alternative realizations, either with or\nwithout linking -en-.

Schreuder et al., 1998). The following examples were given in the\n<LINK "nei-r8">\nintroduction of the task (respectively meaning ‘dog kennel’, ‘ants’ nest’, ‘boys’ bike’,\nand ‘ladies’ orchestra’), in order to illustrate that there are differences in plurality\nratings of the first words of compounds.\n(6) singular plural\nhondenhok 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nmierennest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\njongensfiets 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\ndamesorkest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nThe compounds with linking -en- are constructed such that for 8 forms the linking\nelement could have been inserted for rhythm reasons and where without the linking\nelement, a stress clash would occur. The other 8 forms contain linking -en- in a\nnon-clash context, cf.:\n(7) a. linking -en- in stress clash context\nontmuipentijp, verpeutenbreun, beloekenpeeuw, gebriementreus, breunenmoeling,\ngarmenbrosis, droukenpruivik, koemenmeuluw,\nb. linking -en- in non-clash context\nbreunengebriem, garmenverpeut, peeuwenontmuip, prautenbeloek, moelingenkoem,\npruivikendrouk, brosissengarm, meuluwentreus\nWe expected that the words in (7b) are considered more plural than the ones in\n(7a), for which -en- might occur in order to produce a better rhythm.\nThe compounds with -s- also consisted of two groups, modeled after the two\nexisting patterns zinstype ‘sentence type’ and damestas ‘lady’s bag’. The linking -sin\nzinstype is unlikely to be interpreted as a plural marker, since the plural form of\nzin is zinnen, not *zins. On the other hand, the plural form of dame is dames, which\nmay lead to higher plurality ratings for the left-hand constituent in damestas.\n(8) a. linking -s- where it cannot be interpreted as plural suffix:\nmuifsdroeling, kneursbeloek, knoefsbruivik, koemsdrouvel\nb. linking -s- where it can be interpreted as plural suffix:\nweumelsknaut, gruiversbreun, poedemsgarm, prodesdrouf\nSeveral pseudo-words from the production task of the experiment were included in\nthe comprehension task, to ease the task for the participants. Observe that in the\nwords constructed, -s- cannot be considered part of the onset of the following word,\nas this would create illegitimate onsets in Dutch: *sdr\x04-, *sb-, etc.\n', 'Rhythm and semantics in the selection of linking elements 125\n3.2 Results\nIn the production of pseudo-compounds, -en- was chosenmore often in stress clash\ncontexts (70.7% versus 46.4%, t(37)=4.6, p<.001) than in a context which did not\nhave a stress clash. As predicted, the participants in the comprehension experiment\nconsidered pseudo-compounds with -en- in a stress clash context to be of lower\nplurality than when -en- occurred in a non-clash context (mean 4.84 versusmean\n5.51; t(37)=4.2, p<.001). For the pseudo-compounds with linking -s- the difference\nbetween the two forms presented also turned out to be significant. Where -s-\ncould be a plural form on the basis of Dutch phonotactics, the plurality ratings were\nhigher (mean 2.4 versusmean 2.2; t(37)=2.1, p=0.046, two-tailed). Note that the\nplurality ratings for -s- are considerably lower than the plurality ratings for -en(mean\n2.3 versusmean 5.2).\n3.3 Discussion\nThe pseudo-word experiment confirms the conclusion of the naming task described\nin Section 2: both rhythm and plural semantics are relevant factors in the use of\nlinking elements in Dutch. The two factors appear to be related in the process of\ncomprehension: if -en- can be considered to be present for rhythmic reasons, it is\nconsidered less plural. Both -en- and -s- can function as plural morphemes, but -sgives\nrise to lower plurality ratings than -en-, which is conform the findings in Neijt\net al. (in preparation).\nKrott (2001:226) reflects in her thesis on our pseudo-word experiment. She\n<LINK "nei-r4">\ninvestigated a set of 12537 compounds gathered from the CELEX database with a\nleft-hand constituent that takes -en as plural marker. Her results show that no\nlinking element is themost common choice, even in stress clash situations. She finds no\ninteraction between left and right stress, nor between right stress and linking element.\nIn otherwords: she finds no support for our stress clash hypothesis in the set of existing\ncompounds. In our experiment the participants had to make a forced choice\nbetween -en- and -s-, excluding the option of no linking element. Because this\ndifference in experimental setting, the outcome of Krott’s investigation neither\nconfirms nor disproves our hypothesis.\n4. Conclusion\nThe experiments discussed show that plural semantics and rhythm are factors that\ninfluence the use and interpretation of the linking element -en- in Dutch compounds.\nA linking element was preferred in case of the plural semantics of the left-\nhand member and in a stress clash context. The interpretation of a linking element\n', '126 Anneke Neijt, Loes Krebbers and Paula Fikkert\ndepends on these factors as well: if the reason for a linking element is the resolution\nof a stress clash, the left-hand member is considered less plural.\nInterestingly, no significant difference between adults and children in the\nproduction of the linking element -en- was found. Even in the youngest age group,\nplurality had a stronger effect than rhythm, which may be due to the fact that the\npictures representing the left-hand member strongly suggested either a singular or\nplural response, independently of the right-hand member.\nThe linking -en- was the least preferred strategy in the condition [−plural,\n−rhythmic]. Yet, even in that condition we found amuch higher percentage of -enlinking\nmorphemes than warranted on the basis of existing compounds (cf. Krott\n<LINK "nei-r4">\n2001).We cannot offer an explanation for this fact. It could be the case that existing\ncompounds follow another pattern than new formations. In this respect it seems\nworth investigating the historical development of linking elements. Historical\nchanges such as the loss of case endings and the loss of allomorphy for singular\nnouns (e.g., both ster and sterre ‘star’ were available in earlier stages of the Dutch\nlanguage) may have caused a change in the use, and ultimately the distribution of\nlinking morphemes in compounds in Dutch, which may be reflected in the\nformation of new compounds by present day speakers.\nNotes\n*  We thank Harald Baayen, Andrea Krott and Rob Schreuder for their discussions and help.\nDEST i n*">\n1.  Observe that, although ·enÒ is the common allomorph, linking -en- is sometimes written ·eÒ.\nThe pronunciation of this element is usually schwa, sometimes schwa followed by a nasal, as is the\ncase for the -en plural endings. In the present study, we focus on the -en- linking element, and will\nnot discuss the allomorphy issue.\n2.  Only one rule has no exceptions: diminutives invariably take the linking -s- (pandjesjas ‘tailcoat’,meisjeslijk\n‘girl’s corpse’).\n3.  The translation is ours. The original text is: “De tussenklanken waren oorspronkelijk meervoudsuitgangen,\ngenitiefuitgangen, woorduitgangen of alleen overgangsklanken voor een\ngemakkelijker uitspraak. De toestand die we nu hebben bij de tussenklanken in samenstellingen\nis het resultaat van een eeuwenlang proces van taalontwikkeling waarin de genitief grotendeels\nverloren ging, de woorden hun uitgang verloren en er allerlei verschuivingen optraden, met name\ndoor de werking van de analogie.”\n4.  We have excluded compounds with a potential -s- linking element, because -s- does not bear\non the issue of rhythm, as no extra syllable is added. Moreover, the semantics of the -s- linking\nmorphemes can reflect either the plural or the possessive.\n5.  If linking elements are inserted for rhythmic reasons this may at the same time facilitate the\npronunciation of these words.\n6.  We did not distinguish between primary and secondary stress.
