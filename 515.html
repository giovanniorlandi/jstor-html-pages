These tumors as a group are very heterogeneous, with varying characteristics attributed to each tissue of \norigin and tumor subtype. The pathogenesis of the different subtypes of NETs is not fully understood, but recent studies suggest \nthe Notch signaling pathway may be dysregulated in these tumors either by under or overexpression of Notch receptors and/or \nligands, or by disruption of pathway functionality through other means. Notch receptors can function as tumor suppressors in \nsome cellular contexts and oncogenes in others which may, in part, account for the wide range of phenotypes present in NETs. \nCancer stem cells are present in these tumors and may be responsible for the high rate of chemotherapy resistance, recurrence \nand metastasis. The heterogeneity of NETs suggests that to fully understand the role of Notch signaling and the therapeutic \nimplications thereof, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of Notch expression and function across all NET subtypes is \nrequired. Here we outline the current knowledge base with respect to current therapies and Notch signaling in neuroendocrine \ntumors of the lung, skin, thyroid, GI tract and endocrine pancreas.\nKey words: Neuroendocrine tumor; Notch; small cell lung carcinoma; medullary thyroid carcinoma; merkel cell carcinoma; \npancreatic NET; carcinoid\nAccess this article online\nQuick Response Code:\nWebsite: \nwww.jcmtjournal.com\nDOI: \n10.20517/2394-4722.2016.30\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative \nCommons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License, which allows \nothers to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as \nthe author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical \nterms.\nFor reprints contact: service@oaepublish.com\nHow to cite this article: Crabtree JS, Miele L.

These \ntumors are typically slow-growing, yet pose a significant \nthreat due to high metastatic potential. In many cases, \npatients initially present with advanced metastatic disease \nresulting in poor outcomes and low 5-year survival rates. \nAn understanding of the mechanism(s) of tumorigenesis \nand metastasis is required for target identification and new \ntherapeutic development, since many NET subtypes have \nno curative options beyond surgical resection.\nIn recent years, studies have suggested that the Notch \nsignaling pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis \nof NETs. Notch signaling has been studied for many \nyears in the context of cancer and as these pathways are \ndissected, the complexity of Notch signaling becomes \nmore and more evident. Notch signaling is classified into \ntwo broad categories: 1) canonical signaling, wherein \nNotch receptors regulate transcription through CSL (CBF1/Suppressor\nof Hairless/LAG-1), also known as RBP-\nJk, and can play an oncogenic or tumor suppressive role \ndepending on context, or 2) non-canonical, which functions \nthrough interplay with other signaling networks including \nphosphatidylinositol 3’ kinase (PI3K)/Akt, mTOR, NFkB\nand beta-catenin.[1-6] In NETs, interactions with these \npathways as well as complexes between canonical Notch \ntarget hairy enhancer of split 1 (Hes1) and achaete-schute \ncomplex-like 1 (ASCL-1) have been reported.[7-14] Many \nof these pathways can be pharmacologically modulated \nfor translational research and eventually for experimental \ntherapy of NETs, once the role of Notch signaling in \nthese tumors is more clearly elucidated. Here we review \nthe current state of NET therapies, the role of canonical \nand non-canonical Notch signaling in these tumor types, \n', '                                                                                                       Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦280\nand the role of cancer stem cells in NET pathogenesis, \nchemoresistance and recurrence.\nNOTCH SIGNALING\nThe Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily \nconserved, critical component of basic cellular \nprocesses such as proliferation, stem cell maintenance, \nand differentiation during both embryonic and adult \ndevelopment. The canonical Notch signaling pathway has \nbeen well-studied and typically depends on the binding of \na Notch receptor to its ligand residing on a neighboring \ncell. This ligand binding promotes the separation of \nthe extracellular subunit from the transmembrane \nsubunit, which is followed by cleavage of the receptor’s \ntransmembrane subunit by ADAM metalloproteases \n(primarily ADAM-10) and gamma secretase. The latter \ncleavage releases the active form of Notch, the Notch \nintracellular domain (NICD). The NICD then translocates \ninto the nucleus and binds to the transcription factor \nCSL (CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG1), also known \nas RBP-Jk, to control expression of Notch-regulated \ngenes.[15-18] Ligand-independent activation of Notch \ncleavage has been reported in some contexts, notably \nbreast cancer stem cells, where it is mediated by activation \nof ADAM-17 via the Sphingosine 1-phosphate pathway.[19]\nDifferent species contain different numbers of Notch \nisoforms. Drosophila contains one Notch receptor, C. \nelegans has two redundant receptors, and mammals contain \nfour Notch receptors, Notch1-4. Notch receptors contain \nan extracellular domain that includes multiple epidermal \ngrowth factor (EGF)-like repeats in varying numbers \nthat are involved in ligand binding. The intracellular \nportion of Notch transmits cellular signals and contains \nan RBP-Jκ Association Module (RAM) domain, a nuclear \nlocalization signal (NLS), a seven ankyrin repeat (ANK) \ndomain and a transactivation domain that contains \nconserved proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine-rich \n(PEST) motifs. For a comprehensive review of known \nNotch ligands, see.[17] In mammals, Notch ligands include \nDelta-like1 (DLL1), Delta-like3 (DLL3) and Delta-like4 \n(DLL4), which are homologous to Drosophila Delta, \nalong with Jagged1 (JAG1) and Jagged2 (JAG2), which \nhave homology to Drosophila Serrate. Notch ligands have \nmultiple EGF-like repeats in their extracellular domains \nand all contain an N-terminal DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG2) \nmotif that, along with the first two EGF-like repeats is \nrequired for ligand-receptor interaction. Jagged ligands \ncontain almost twice the number of EGF repeats as well \nas an additional cysteine rich region compared to DLL \nligands. The intracellular portion of all Notch ligands \nlacks major homology with the exception that some, but \nnot all, ligands contain multiple lysine residues and a \nC-terminal PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain.\nIn addition to the well-studied canonical signaling, Notch \nsignaling can also occur in a non-canonical fashion that \nis independent of CSL and can be ligand-dependent or \nindependent.[1,20] Compared to canonical Notch signaling, \nknowledge of non-canonical Notch mechanisms is \nlimited, with the majority of studies performed in cancer \nand immune system cells.[1] Non-canonical Notch \npathways present an interesting new avenue of study and \nmay reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention in the \ntranslational setting.\nOne mechanism of non-canonical Notch signaling occurs \nthrough the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cancer and the \nimmune system. The Wnt/-catenin pathway regulates \ncell pluripotency and cell fate decisions, and aberrant \nfunctions or mutations in β-catenin have been associated \nwith a number of cancers and other human diseases. Noncanonical\nNotch signaling can result in an antagonistic \ninteraction between Notch signaling and Wnt/βcatenin[2,20,21]\nthat disrupts the regulation of developmental \nand disease processes.[20] This results in an inverse \nrelationship between elevated levels of membrane-bound \nNotch and lower levels of active β-catenin[20] leading to \nnegative regulation of Wnt signaling.[4] One example of \nthis crosstalk is the loss of Notch1 in the epidermis of mice, \nwhich results in activated Wnt/-catenin signaling and the \nformation of hyperplasia and cancer -- both of which can \nbe reversed by the introduction of exogenous NICD.[22]\nNon-canonical Notch signaling is also involved in the \nactivation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the immune \nsystem as well as in the tumor-promoting effects of \ninterleukin-6 (IL-6).[1,23] These events rely on NF-κB and \ndemonstrate crosstalk with other cellular pathways in \nthe absence of canonical Notch signaling. Studies have \ndemonstrated that even in the absence of CSL, CD4+ \nT-cell activation and proliferation through NF-κB requires \nNICD playing a major role in the signature CBM complex \n(CARMA1, MALT1 and BCL10).[24] The NICD can also \nactivate a non-canonical signaling cascade via mTORC2 \nand Akt as a means of transmitting extracellular nutrient \nsensing cues to promote cell survival.[5,25] Notch signaling, \nboth canonical and non-canonical, is regulated by a \nmyriad of known and unknown binding partners as well as \nposttranslational modifications. Comprehensive reviews \nof Notch signaling are available.[18,26,27]\nNETs - ENTEROPANCREATIC\nThe annual incidence of enteropancreatic NETs is \n2-5/100,000 patients in the United States and recent studies \nsuggest that this incidence will continue to rise in the \ncoming years.[21,28-30] Overall survival (OS) for metastatic \npancreatic and small bowel NETs is 24 and 56 months, \nrespectively.[29] Enteropancreatic NETs, or NETs that form \nin the pancreas or the gut (also called carcinoids), can be \ncategorized as functional or non-functional depending on \ntheir level of hormone release. Pancreatic NETs can hyper \nsecrete insulin (insulinoma), glucagon (glucagonoma), \nsomatostatin (somatostatinoma), pancreatic polypeptide \n', '            Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦ 281\n(PPoma) or vasoactive peptide (VIPoma) and those in the \nGI tract can secrete high levels of gastrin (gastrinoma). \nThe classification of NETs clinically is based on \nimmunohistochemical staining for low molecular weight \nkeratins, chromogranin and somatostatin, as well as an \nassessment of Ki-67 index from within the region of \nhighest mitotic density.[31] Other observable factors such \nas anatomical site, histology, grade, level of differentiation \nand hormone secretion are also used but this phenotypic \nclassification system has led to confusion in both the \nclinical and research settings due to the molecularly \nheterogeneous nature of these diseases. For clinical trial \npurposes, enteropancreatic NETs have historically been \ngrouped together in clinical trials, with enrollment open \nto all patients with gut NETs regardless of subtype. It \nis now recognized that NETs must be subdivided into \npancreatic and non-pancreatic subgroups to reduce \nheterogeneity in clinical trials[32] and that progression free \nsurvival (PFS) may be a more relevant primary endpoint \nin clinical trial design than OS because most patients \nhave indolent disease.[33] Additionally, a key predictor of \noutcome in enteropancreatic NETs is the degree of tumor \ndifferentiation. Well-differentiated tumors have a better \nprognosis than poorly differentiated tumors, which can \nhave a 5 year overall survival of less than 4%.[30]\nEnteropancreatic NETs are relatively slow-growing and \ntraditional chemotherapy regimens have limited efficacy.[34] \nThe selection of therapy is driven by the staging, location \nof the tumor and symptom profile. Surgery is often used \nin the management of NETs for both curative (localized \ndisease) and palliative care (widespread metastases). First \nline therapy for enteropancreatic NETs is somatostatin \nanalogs (SSAs),[34] with VEGF pathway inhibitors, \nmTOR inhibitors or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy \n(PRRT) as additional options. Many of these compounds \nare currently in clinical practice and/or clinical trials and \nhave exhibited moderate success. SSAs such as octreotide, \nlanreotide and pasireotide help control symptoms of \nhormone hypersecretion (carcinoid syndrome), and more \nrecently have been noted to have anti-proliferative effects \non well or moderately differentiated NETs.[35,36] For \nexample, the PROMID trial (NCT00171873) examined \nmetastatic midgut NETs[37] and the CLARINET trial \n(NCT00353496) focused on pancreatic, midgut or \nhindgut NETs,[38] both noting prolonged PFS in the SSA \ntreatment arms compared to placebo. The NETTER-1 trial \n(NCT01578239) uses radiolabeled SSA ([177Lu-DOTA0, \nTyr3] octreotate) in PRRT for a localized anticancer therapy \nin patients with inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive \nmetastatic midgut NETs with the primary endpoint of PFS. \nThe RADIANT-3 trial (NCT00510068) demonstrated an \nincreased median PFS in patients treated with the mTOR \ninhibitor everolimus/RAD001 (11 months compared to 4.6 \nmonths for placebo) in patients with advanced pancreatic \nNETs.[39] Finally, the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor \nsunitinib was studied in a prospective trial in patients with \nadvanced, well differentiated pancreatic NETs. PFS was \n11.6 months in the sunitinib group compared to 5.5 months \nin the placebo arm.[40] The RADIANT-3 and the sunitinib \nstudy both resulted in FDA approval of these drugs for \npatients with pancreatic NETs. The RADIANT-4 trial \n(NCT01524783) further confirmed the role of everolimus \nin adult patients with advanced, progressive, welldifferentiated,\nnon-functional endocrine tumors of the lung \nor gastrointestinal tract.[41] Patients receiving everolimus \nhad a 7.1 month increase in PFS compared to placebo.[41] \nA comprehensive review of carcinoid and NET clinical \ntrials is available.[33] The heterogeneity of NETs requires a \ndeeper understanding of tumorigenic mechanisms and drug \nfunction that will guide future therapeutic development, \npatient management strategies and eventually, genomicsdriven\nclinical trial design.\nGenetic syndromes account for 15-20% of NETs. The \nmost common syndromes include multiple endocrine \nneoplasia type 1 and type 2A/B (MEN1 and MEN2A/B), \nvon Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), neurofibromatosis \ntype 1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and in \neach of these syndromes, specific loss- or gain-of-function \nmutations have been identified in causative genes. The \nremaining 80-85% of NETs is considered sporadic and \ngenome-wide studies have been performed in an attempt \nto understand driver genetic mutations. Jiao et al.[42] \nperformed whole exome sequencing of 10 pancreatic NETs \nthat resulted in the identification of somatic mutations in \na number of known cancer-associated genes including \nMEN1, DAXX, ATRX, a number of genes involved in the \nmTOR pathway, and to a lesser extent TP53. Banck et al.[43] \nstudied forty-eight well-differentiated, small intestinal \nNETs (carcinoids) by whole exome sequencing and also \nidentified somatic mutations in many cancer-associated \ngenes including FGFR2, MEN1, HOOK3, EZH2, MLF1, \nCARD11, VHL, NONO, SMAD1, FANCD2 and BRAF, yet \nonly 21 genes were in common with a subsequent study \nthat analyzed an additional 55 well-differentiated small \nintestinal NETs.[44] Upon further comparison with the Jiao \nstudy,[42] only 17 genes with somatic mutations found in \nsmall intestinal NETs were in common with pancreatic \nNETs.[44] These data highlight that this group of tumors \nneeds to be carefully studied, subgrouped and analyzed \nto account for heterogeneity in terms of site of origin, \nlevel of differentiation and underlying driver mutations. \nInterestingly and despite the somewhat disparate results, \nall of these studies highlight the putative role of chromatin \nremodeling, perhaps in concert with Notch signaling, in \nthe etiology of enteropancreatic NETs.\nA popular model of cancer formation is that tumors are \ndependent on a subset of highly tumorigenic cells, socalled\ncancer stem cells, for initiation, maintenance and \npropagation.[45] Cancer stem cells have been identified \nin a number of solid tumors[46-48] and leukemias,[49] and \nare noted for their pluripotency, unique complement of \ncell-surface antigens, ability to self-renew, and ability \nto form xenografts in immunocompromised mice from \n', '                                                                                                       Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦282\nvery small numbers of cells. Cancer stem cells are often \nchemoresistant, mediate tumor recurrence, and recruit the \nhost immune system through a variety of mechanisms to \nsupport tumor cell growth and metastasis.[45]\nCancer stem cells have been identified in gastrointestinal[50] \nand pancreatic NETs.[51] In gastrointestinal NETs, a \npopulation of stem cells was identified based on ALDH \npositivity which is required for chemoresistance and \nenhances self-renewal.[50] ALDH+ cells exhibit anchorageindependent\ngrowth and have elevated expression of Src, \nErk, Akt and mTOR. Because therapies directed towards \nthe Akt/mTOR pathway are already clinically validated in \nNETs, the investigators focused on Src and treated mouse \nxenografts with anti-Src siRNA. This treatment resulted in \na 91% decrease in tumor mass and suggested an additional \ntreatment avenue for gastrointestinal NETs.[50] In pancreatic \nNETs, stem cells have been isolated that co-express the \ncell-surface protein CD90 and aldehyde dehydrogenase \nA1 (ALDHA1), as well as CD47 which serves as a flag to \nevade the immune system.[51] These stem-like cells form \ntumors in mice and the treatment of tumor-bearing mice \nwith anti-CD47 antibody therapy inhibits tumor growth, \nprevents metastasis and prolongs survival. Combination \ntherapy with anti-CD47 and anti-EGFR (expressed by \nthe majority of pancreatic NETs) in the preclinical setting \ndemonstrated improved efficacy over anti-CD47 antibody \ntherapy alone[51] and supports the notion that treatment of \nhuman pancreatic NETs with stem cell specific antigens \nwill yield clinically significant results.\nNETs in general remain significantly understudied with \nrespect to molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, and \nparticularly Notch signaling. Mechanistically, Notch may \ncontribute to carcinogenesis by inhibiting differentiation, \npromoting cellular proliferation and/or inhibiting \napoptosis, yet few studies have comprehensively examined \nthese endpoints with respect to the four Notch receptors \nand their ligands in NETs. The available studies suggest \na tumor suppressive function for Notch1 in cells derived \nfrom the neuroendocrine lineage. This is consistent with \nrole of Notch in Drosophila neurogenesis, where Notch \nrestricts differentiation towards the neuronal lineage. The \nloss of Notch in Drosophila embryos results in uncontrolled \nectodermal differentiation down the neuronal lineage.[52,53] \nIt is plausible that loss of Notch signaling would allow \nNET cells to acquire or maintain a partially differentiated \nneuroendocrine phenotype while retaining the ability to \nproliferate. For example, recent studies[11,12,54-57] report that \nNotch1 signaling is minimal or absent in gut carcinoids, \nmedullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pulmonary \ntypical and atypical carcinoids. Yet these same cancers \nexpress high levels of human achaete-scute homolog 1 \n(hASH1), a basic helix loop helix transcription factor that \nis regulated by Notch signaling. The aberrant expression \nof hASH1 and the arrest of NET cells at an early stage of \ndifferentiation may be due to decreased Notch1-activated \nexpression of Hes1 and Hes5 which both facilitate \ndegradation of hASH1.[57] Transient overexpression of \nNICD in BON1 cells resulted in increased proliferation \nand dose-dependent increases in Hes1. In contrast, \nimmunohistochemistry for Notch1, Hes1, Hey1, pIGF1R \nand FGF2 antibodies on a tissue microarray of 120 well \ndifferentiated NETs arising from the pancreas (n = 74), \nileum (n = 31) and rectum (n = 15), demonstrated elevated \nNotch1 expression in 100% rectal, 34% of pancreatic, and \n0% of ileal NETs, and Hes1 expression in 64% of rectal, \n10% of pancreatic and 0% of ileal NETs,[58] exhibiting \nsignificant variability in Notch1 signaling across different \ntissue types. There is limited information on other Notch \nreceptors or the ligands involved in Notch signaling in \nNETs and a comprehensive analysis of Notch expression \npatterns across all enteropancreatic NET subtypes is \nrequired to fully understand the variability and potentially \nredundant functions of Notch receptors and ligands.\nThe ability of Notch to behave as an oncogene or tumor \nsuppressor depending on cellular context is driven in part \nby the availability of coactivators and corepressors. CSL \ncoactivators such as MAML, SKIP and p300 are well \nknown to activate transcription of Notch target genes by \nbinding to NICD. Conversely, in the absence of NICD, \ncorepressors also regulate transcription in specific ways \nand canonical Notch corepressors include SMRT,[59] \nSIRT[60] and LSD1 (histone lysine demethylase),[61] among \nothers (reviewed in[62]). Epigenetic regulation by Notch \nactivator and repressor complexes containing histone \nacetyltransferases, histone demethyltransferases, histone \nmethyltransferases, etc. actively remodel the chromatin at \nNotch-responsive target genes and provide an additional \nlayer of reversible regulation.[63] Chromatin sites accessible \nto Notch NICDs are also influenced by transcriptional \nregulators that can act as cofactors or inhibitors.[64-66] \nA recent report by Liefke et al.[63] demonstrates that the \nhistone demethylase KDM5A/RBP2 is a key component \nof the CSL repressor complex. Data from our laboratory \ndemonstrates that RBP2 is upregulated in gastrointestinal \nNETs and in liver metastases from primary NET tumors, \nsuggesting that RBP2 may be actively repressing canonical \nNotch activity (Crabtree, et al. 2016 Oncogenesis in press).\nNETs - PULMONARY\nPulmonary NETs are an equally diverse set of NETs \nthat fall on a continuum from well-differentiated typical \ncarcinoid (TC), to less differentiated atypical carcinoid \n(AC), to highly malignant, poorly differentiated small cell \nlung carcinoma (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine \ncarcinoma (LCNECs).[67] Features distinguishing these \ngroups include size, with TC and AC defined as ≥ 0.5 cm, \nand histologic characteristics such as organoid growth \npatterns with uniform cytologic features. These tumors \ncontain a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm \nand nuclei containing finely granulated chromatin, \nwhich is coarser in AC than in TC. Prominent nucleoli \nare also present in AC, but not in TC. New 2015 WHO \n', '            Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦ 283\nclinicopathological criteria also define the mitotic index of \nthese tumors (number of mitoses per 2 mm2 in the area \nof highest mitotic activity with the most viable tumor \ncells).[68,69] The mitotic index of typical carcinoid is < 2, \natypical carcinoid is 2-10, whereas SCLC and LCNECs \nhave mitotic indices > 10.[67,68] Lung tumors can also \nbe distinguished by grade, with TC classified as low \ngrade, AC as intermediate grade and SCLC/LCNECs \nas high grade.[68,69] Identity of these tumors is typically \nconfirmed by immunohistochemistry using the cellular \nproliferation Ki-67, as well as neuroendocrine markers \nsuch as synaptophysin, chromogranin A and neural cell \nadhesion molecule (NCAM) to distinguish SCLC from \nnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  TC have no necrosis \nand Ki-67 ≤ 5%, AC can have focal necrosis and Ki-67 \n≤ 20% and SCLC have Ki-67 > 50%. Pulmonary NETs \nmay also exist, albeit at much lower incidence than other \npulmonary NETs, as heterogeneous, combination tumors \nconsisting of mixtures of SCLC and LCNEC, or SCLC \nand NSCLC with neuroendocrine differentiation.[67] These \nmixed phenotypes may indicate clonal selection and/or \nphenotypic plasticity of a pluripotent cancer stem cell.\nPulmonary NETs have a low incidence in the US, with a rate \nof 1.6/100,000 individuals. TCs comprise 1-2% and ACs \nmake up only 0.1-0.2% of all pulmonary tumors, whereas \nSCLC and LCNET make up 20% and 1.6-3%, respectively. \nOverall survival is good for the well-differentiated TC \ntumors (92-100% OS) and moderate for AC (61-88% OS), \nwhereas the higher grade, poorly differentiated SCLC and \nLCNET have a grim prognosis with OS as low as 5%.[70] \nThere are limited treatment options for pulmonary NETs \nand the only curative therapies for TC and AC is surgery. \nThese tumors are historically refractive to chemotherapy \nand exhibit response rates as low as 22%.[71] In the case \nof advanced disease, such as that seen with patients \ninitially presenting with SCLC and LCNEC, surgery is \nrarely performed and systemic chemotherapy is the first \nline treatment. Combination etoposide plus carboplatin \nchemotherapy has high response rates (about 90%) \nbut within 1 year the majority of tumors recur and are \nrefractory to further treatment.[71] mTORC1 inhibitors \n(everolimus, temsirolimus) have been used in combination \nwith standard of care chemotherapy, but these compounds \nexhibited only moderate efficacy with the liability of doselimiting\ntoxicities.[72] mTOR inhibitors have also been \ncombined clinically with SSAs in the RADIANT-2 trial \n(NCT00412061) that included enteropancreatic NETs as \nwell as pulmonary TC and ACs. Subgroup analyses from \nthis study found a median PFS of 5.6 months for the few \nTC and AC patients who received only the octreotide \nLAR and no advantage for the patients receiving the \ncombination therapy.[73] A follow-up trial called the LUNA \ntrial (NCT01563354) is a prospective, randomized, openlabel,\nthree-arm design to study advanced lung (TC and \nAC) and thymic NET response to pasireotide LAR, \neverolimus or both in combination. The RADIANT-4 trial \n(NCT01524783) enrolled adult patients with advanced, \nprogressive, well-differentiated, non-functional endocrine \ntumors of the lung or gastrointestinal tract to receive \neverolimus or placebo with the primary endpoint of PFS.[41] \nPatients receiving everolimus had significantly improved \nmedian PFS of 7.1 months compared to placebo.[41] \nSunitinib was studied in a phase II trial in patients with \nrelapsed or refractory SCLC and the treatment was poorly \ntolerated and resulted in limited gain in PFS.[74] Tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors such as imatinib have also been studied in \npulmonary NETs with disappointing results.[75]\nThe genetic basis of pulmonary NET formation has been \nexplored in recent years. There are many cases of targeted \nanalysis identifying inactivating mutations in TP53, RB1 \nand PIK3CA genes.[76-79] Genome-wide studies have \nbeen performed[80-83] to identify copy number alterations, \nsomatic single nucleotide variants and alterations in gene \nexpression associated with SCLC. From these studies, \npotential driver mutations were identified in cancerassociated\ngenes such as TP53, RB1, CREBBP, EP300, \nMLL and the SOX family. A separate study conducted \nwhole genome sequencing of 110 SCLC and identified \nbiallelic inactivation of TP53, RB1, CREBBP, EP300, \nTP73, RBL1/2, as well as inactivating mutations in Notch \nfamily genes in 25% of cases.[83,84]\nAs with pancreatic NETs, cancer stem cells provide a \nplausible mechanism for drug resistance, recurrence and \nmetastasis of SCLC. However, due to limited availability \nof human clinical samples, the majority of the work to \nidentify markers of SCLC has been performed in cell \nlines by isolating side populations of cells with stemlike\nfeatures. Using the SCLC cell lines NCI-H82, H146 \nand H526, Salcido et al.[85] isolated a population of cells \nwith high rates of proliferation, efficient self-renewal and \ndecreased cell surface expression of CD56 and CD90. \nThese isolated cells also overexpress many genes associated \nwith cancer stem cells and drug resistance, including genes \ninvolved in the Notch signaling pathway.[85] In a separate \nstudy, a side population of cells was isolated from lung \ncancer cell lines established from primary tumors.[86] This \nside population was strongly positive for CD44 and coexpressed\nCD90, while having mesenchymal morphology, \nresistance to irradiation, and increased expression of stem \ncell related genes Nanog and Oct4.[86] CD133 is a common \ncell surface antigen in SCLC stem cell populations and \nwas upregulated in cell populations as one of several stem \ncell markers in six separate studies from various SCLC \ncell lines.[87-92] In one of these studies, it was found that \nCD133+ cells express increased neuropeptide receptors \nwhich revealed an avenue for therapeutic intervention.[90] \nSubsequent testing of neuropeptide receptor antagonists \nrevealed that one of the analogs, Peptide 1, decreased \ncell growth and increased apoptosis in SCLC cell lines. \nFurther, Peptide 1 produced a significant reduction in \ntumor volume in mouse xenograft models, exhibiting very \nfew CD133 positive cells after treatment, compared with \ntumors treated with etoposide.[90] In other studies, inhibitors \n', '                                                                                                       Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦284\nwere selected due to known pathway involvement in \nSCLC. For example, a dual mTORC1/2 and class I PI3K \ninhibitor VS-5584 was tested in SCLC xenograft models \nand a PDX model established from a SCLC lymph node \nmetastasis, resulting in significant decreases in tumor \nburden, decreased tumor-initiating frequency and marked \ndepletion of cancer stem cells.[93]\nThe Notch signaling pathway is of increasing interest in \nSCLC and as with enteropancreatic NETs, Notch signaling \nin the lung is tissue type and cell context dependent. Notch \nsignaling can promote the growth of NSCLC, yet inhibit \nthe growth of SCLC.[94,95] The tumor phenotype in SCLC \nmay be driven via Notch3 expression, which is decreased \nin SCLC compared to non-tumor lung tissue as measured \nby immunohistochemistry.[96] SCLC may be the result of \nderegulated Notch in cell fate decisions that determine \ndifferentiation towards the epithelial Clara, ciliated and \npulmonary neuroendocrine cell lineages.[97] In mouse \nmodels with allelic series deletion of Notch1, 2 and 3, all \nthree Notch receptors were required in an additive manner \nto regulate the abundance of neuroendocrine cells in the \nlung, whereas only contribution from Notch2 was required \nfor Clara/ciliated cell development.[98]\nOver the years, many targeted therapies have been \ndeveloped to modulate the Notch signaling pathway, \nincluding neutralizing antibodies, decoy ligands, blocking \npeptides, natural compounds and -secretase inhibitors \n(reviewed in[18]). The Notch 2/3 neutralizing antibody \ntarextumab, inhibits tumor growth in mice in a variety of \nepithelial tumors, but also in SCLC xenograft tumors,[99] \nsuggesting that Notch2 and/or Notch3 inhibition can \nbe therapeutic in the clinical setting. A novel way of \nexploiting decreased Notch signaling therapeutically is by \ntargeting Notch ligands that are frequently overexpressed \neven in tumors with low or absent canonical Notch \nsignaling. This approach was pioneered in SCLC, which \nfrequently expresses high levels of DLL3. Because DLL3 \ncan function as a Notch inhibitor by retaining Notch \nreceptors in the cytoplasm or by cis-inhibition, a DLL3 \nmAb conjugated with a DNA damaging toxin was used \nas a highly effective chemotherapeutic in preclinical PDX \nmodels of SCLC. These experiments resulted in complete, \ndurable responses 5 months post treatment. The naked \nmAb had no therapeutic activity, suggesting that DLL3 \ninhibition alone is not sufficient for tumor regression in \nSCLC.[14] In other studies, it has been proposed that, in \naddition to the primary SCLC progression as a result of \nTP53 and RB1 alterations, secondary transitions from nonsmall\ncell lung carcinoma to SCLC can occur following \nchemotherapy. This implies phenotypic plasticity from \nan epithelial to a neuroendocrine lineage can occur under \ntreatment-imposed selection. A recent publication by \nMeder et al.[13] demonstrates that this process is mediated \nby the Notch-ASCL1-RB-P53 signaling axis.\nParalog-specific effects add yet another layer of complexity \nto Notch signaling, since not all Notch receptors are \ncreated equal. Notch receptors are not always redundant \nand in some cases their functions are not only independent \nbut opposite. Notch1 and Notch2 have opposite effects on \nAkt in NSCLC.[100] In Luminal B breast cancer, Notch1 and \nNotch4 have similar effects on endocrine resistance but \nact through completely different sets of downstream genes \nand produce different cellular phenotypes[101] (Espinoza \nand Miele, unpublished). Notch1, 3, and 4 are oncogenic \nin the breast, while Notch2 has been described as a tumor \nsuppressor in breast cancer cell lines.[102] The mechanism \nof these paralog-specific effects is unknown but may \ninvolve non-canonical signals, such as the inhibitory role \nof Notch4 on SMAD[103] or the stimulatory role of Notch1 \non NF-κB.[104] The oncogenic activity of Notch4 in the \nmouse mammary gland is independent of CSL and is \ntherefore completely or at least partially non-canonical.[105] \nAnother explanation for paralog-specific effects may \nbe in quantitative signal intensity of the different Notch \nligands. For example, constitutively activating mutations \nin Notch1 and Notch2 are equally oncogenic in a subset \nof triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),[106] despite the \nfact that Notch2 has been described as a tumor suppressor \nin TNBC cell lines.[102] Therefore, the absolute number of \nNICD molecules available as a result of overproduction \nor decreased turnover may dictate different phenotypic \nconsequences. Additionally, paralog-specific effects may \nalso be achieved by selective activation of chromatin \nsites with different affinity for Notch NICDs, epigenetic \nmodifications by NICD binding partners that alters binding \nsite availability, or by a combination of canonical and \nnon-canonical effects that depends on NICD abundance. \nIn short, the role of paralog-specific effects has been \npoorly characterized in NETs and is an area in need of \nfurther study.\nNETs - SKIN\nMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive \ncutaneous NET that occurs most frequently in the elderly \nand/or the immunosuppressed, although more than 90% of \nMCC patients have no known immune dysfunction.[107] It is \nseen primarily in light-skinned individuals and has a male \npredominance of 2:1.[108] MCC occurs most frequently in \nsun-exposed areas of skin, particularly the head and neck, \nfollowed by extremities and then the trunk. In 80% of cases, \nMCC is associated with the Merkel cell polyomavirus \n(MCPyV).[109,110] Infection with MCPyV is not sufficient to \ninduce tumorigenesis[111] and additional events including \nloss of cellular immune surveillance are required for \noncogenic transformation. The MCPyV large T-antigen \nis oncogenic in MCC by binding the retinoblastoma \nprotein and promoting cell cycle progression.[112] The \nsmall T-antigen of MCPyV acts downstream of the mTOR \nsignaling pathway by maintaining hyperphosphorylation \nof 4E-binding protein (4EBP1), resulting in dysregulated \ncap-dependent translation in MCC.[113] Patients with \nMCPyV negative MCC tumors have increased DNA \n', '            Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦ 285\ndamage signatures at the genetic level, presumably as a \nresult of UV exposure.[114,115]\nMCC is highly metastatic and the 5 year survival rate \nis dependent on the stage at which original diagnosis is \nmade. Patients with local disease at diagnosis have a 5 \nyear OS of 63-87%, those with regional nodal involvement \n39-42% and 0-18% for patients with widespread, distant \nmetastases.[116] The annual incidence of MCC in the US \nis increasing, with an estimated 1,600 patients diagnosed \nper year.[117] The increase in incidence is attributed to \npopulation aging, more known risk factors associated with \nthis cancer (such as increased aggregate sun exposure), \nand increased diagnostic power with cytokeratin 20 \nimmunohistochemical staining, which is positive in 88100%\nof MCC cases.[118]\nThere are no FDA-approved agents for the treatment \nof MCC, nor are there established, standard of care \nchemotherapy regimens.[109] Current first line therapies \nfor localized disease include surgical resection followed \nby postoperative radiation therapy. Radiotherapy plays \na significant role in both the curative setting, and \npalliative care setting when used as a monotherapy in \nadvanced metastatic MCC.[119] Systemic chemotherapy \nregimens used for SCLC are employed and typically \ninclude a combination of a platinum agent (cisplatin or \ncarboplatin) and topoisomerase inhibitor (etoposide)[120-122] \nor combination cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and \nvincristine therapy (CAV therapy).[122] Cytotoxic \nchemotherapies do not produce durable responses and \nare associated with significant toxicity, highlighting \nthe need for targeted, mechanism-based therapies. \nImmunohistochemical analysis of MCC tumors has led \nto development and use of several new mechanism-based \ntherapies including SSAs (octreotide, lanreotide),[123,124] \npan-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (pazopanib),[125] \nPI3K inhibitors,[126,127] vitamin D receptor agonists,[128] \nsmall molecules to downregulate Survivin,[129,130] antiPD-L1\nantibody therapy,[131] and an antibody conjugate \nlinking a maytansinoid microtubule assembly inhibitor to \nCD56 (lorvotuzumab mertansine).[132] Many of these are \nnow in clinical trials for MCC and an excellent review of \nfuture potential therapeutic options and current clinical \ntrials for MCC can be found in ref.[118]\nIn addition to immunohistochemistry, genomic studies \nhave also been applied to MCC to identify new therapeutic \ntargets and understand the mechanism of tumorigenesis \nin both MCPyV positive and negative cases. Gene panel \nstudies on 15 MCPyV negative and 12 MCPyV positive \nMCC samples identified mutations in TP53, KIT, PIK3CA \nand EGFR genes, with RB1 mutations only identified \nin the virus negative samples, suggesting that the \ndysregulation of the RB pathway may be a critical step \nin tumorigenesis.[133] Targeted sequencing of 17 MCC \npatient samples with unknown virus status, identified \nmutations in TP53, RB and NOTCH1, among others.[134] \nExome sequencing studies performed on small numbers of \nformalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded MCC samples and also \nidentified RB1 in MCPyV negative tumors.[135] Another \nsmall study conducted on 4 MCPyV positive tumors \nidentified somatic mutations in PDE4DIP, as well as genes \nwithin the DNA damage response (PRKDC, AURKB, \nERCC5, ATR and ATRX) and epigenetic modifying \nenzymes (MLL3).[136] Harms et al.[115] performed a slightly \nlarger study of whole exome sequencing of 9 MCPyV \nnegative and 7 MCPyV positive MCC samples. Known \nmutations were identified in TP53, RB1 and PIK3CA \nalong with novel activating mutations in oncogenes \nlike HRAS, loss-of-function mutations in PRUNE2 and \nNOTCH family genes, and mutations disrupting the PI3K \nsignaling pathway in the MCPyV negative tumors.[115,137] \nFurther, the MCPyV negative tumors also had a higher \noverall mutational burden and were characterized by a \nprominent UV-signature pattern with C > T transitions \nmaking up 85% of the mutations. MCPyV positive tumors \nhad a much lower mutational burden and were lacking the \nUV signature, suggesting that MCPyV negative tumors \nhave increased susceptibility to UV damage.[115] The most \ncomprehensive study to date included exome sequencing \nof 49 MCC samples (21 positive, 27 negative).[114] This \nstudy confirmed the previous report that the signature of \nMCPyV negative tumors is very different than the MCPyV \npositive tumors. MCPyV negative tumors have a higher \nmutation burden, frequent mutations in TP53 and RB1 \nand additional mutations in genes involved in chromatin \nmodification (ASXL1, MLL2 and MLL3) and DNA damage \npathways (ATM, MSH2, BRCA1). Interestingly, both \nMCPyV positive and negative tumors have mutations \npredicted to activate the PI3K pathway (HRAS, KRAS, \nPIK3CA, PTEN and TSC1) and to inactivate the Notch \nsignaling pathway (Notch1, Notch2),[114] suggesting these \npathways as putative points for intervention in MCC \nregardless of viral status.\nAs discussed for SCLC and enteropancreatic NETs, another \npossible point of intervention is by targeting cancer stem \ncells. However, in the case of MCC, the cell of origin is \nstill under debate. Based on early observation of MCC and \nthe similarity of expression patterns for neuroendocrine \nand epithelial markers, it was presumed that MCCs arise \nfrom the Merkel cell, part of the somatosensory system \nlocated within the basal epidermis. However, with the \nobservations that Merkel cells and MCC are found in \ndifferent regions of the skin and exhibit differential \nexpression of marker proteins, new data are challenging the \nconcept that MCCs arise from Merkel cells.[138] One theory, \nbased on pathologic diagnosis of MCC suggests a role for \npluripotent stem cells in the dermis as the cells of origin, \nfacilitated by UV irradiation and MCPyV infection.[139] \nAnother study proposes that MCCs arise from pro/pre-B or \npre-B cells based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase \nand PAX5 expression, as well as the preference for \npolyomaviruses to preferentially infect undifferentiated \nstem cells or progenitor cells.[140] However, in the absence \n', '                                                                                                       Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦286\nof experimental evidence supporting a stem cell origin, \nmore lineage tracking studies are needed to identify the \ncellular origin of MCC.\nNotch signaling has been an area of active investigation \nin MCC as a result of the genome-wide studies that have \nhighlighted the Notch pathway as one of key interest, with \nsomatic single nucleotide variants identified in Notch1, \nand Notch2 that were independent MCPyV status.[114] The \ninactivating mutations detected in Notch genes were located \nin the EGF-like and ankyrin repeat regions, consistent with \nloss-of-function events characterizing a tumor suppressive \nrole for Notch in MCC.[115] Further, the data on Notch and \nother genes dysregulated in MCC are common with SCLC, \nsuggesting that these pathways are also cornerstones \nof neuroendocrine differentiation in epithelial cells.[114] \nAnother study examined the Notch signaling pathway as \na target of microRNA-375, which is highly overexpressed \nin well-differentiated MCC cell lines yet strikingly \ndownregulated in highly aggressive, undifferentiated \nMCC cell lines.[141] miR-375 overexpression caused posttranscriptional\nrepression of Notch2 and RBPJ resulting \nin decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion \nin vitro. This led to the conclusion that miR-375 is a \nputative regulator of cancer cell aggressiveness through \ninhibition of Notch signaling.[141] In contrast, Panelos et \nal.[142] performed immunohistochemical studies of Notch1 \nexpression in MCC and found 30/31 cases had Notch1 \ncytoplasmic and membrane expression in greater than \n50% of cells. These data contradict the data in other NETs, \nincluding other data on MCC, which suggest Notch1 is a \ntumor suppressor in MCCs.\nNETs - THYROID\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a NET that \noriginates from the thyroid C-cells and express high \nlevels of calcitonin, chromogranin A, synaptophysin \nand achaete-scute complex-like 1 (ASCL1). MTCs are \nrelatively slow growing tumors that comprise 1-2% of \nall thyroid cancers and have a 10 year median survival \nof 65%.[143,144] The majority of these tumors are sporadic, \nbut they can be hereditary and arise with other NETs \nas a part of MEN2A/2B or as familial MTC. Gain-offunction\nmutations in the RET tyrosine kinase gene (most \ncommonly M918T) are the known driver mutation in the \nmajority of these tumors.[145,146] Those tumors that are \nRET mutation negative frequently have RAS mutations \n– and the presence of these mutations appears mutually \nexclusive.[147,148] As with other NETs discussed above, \nthere are no curative therapies for MTC. Surgery is the \nfirst line of treatment for localized disease, but there are no \ntherapeutic options for patients who present with regional \nor widespread metastases, highlighting the critical need \nfor additional therapeutics.\nSeveral promising new directed therapies for MTC are in \ndevelopment or clinical trials. As with other NETs, SSAs \nand mTOR inhibitors have been studied in MTC, and \nhave shown preliminary efficacy in small trials.[149,150] One \nongoing trial (NCT01625520) is examining the efficacy \nof SOM230/pasireotide alone and in combination with \neverolimus in progressive metastatic or postoperative \npersistent MTC. More recently, new drugs that targets \nboth PI3K and mTOR have been developed, with \nBEZ235 showing efficacy in preclinical studies of thyroid \ncancer.[151] Antibody therapy is also in development for \nMTC. Carcinoembryonic antigen or CEA is an antigen \nexpressed by MTC cells and an anti-CEA monoclonal \nantibody combined with autologous hematopoietic stem \ncell rescue has shown promise in a phase 1 study in rapidly \nprogressing metastatic MTC.[152]\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors are also in development and \nAMG706/motesanib was studied in locally advanced or \nmetastatic, progressive or symptomatic MTC in a singlearm\nphase 2 study.[153] Despite the 81% of patients in this \ntrial that achieved stable disease, there was no placebo or \nstandard of care arm, making the interpretation of drug \nefficacy and toxicity a challenge. Axitinib was also studied \nin a small trial of locally advanced MTC (n = 6), and resulted \nin 5/6 or 83% of patients with stable disease > 16 weeks.[154] \nHowever, as with the motesanib trial, the single-arm study \ndesign, as well as the small number of MTC patients \nincluded makes the trial results difficult to interpret. The \nZETA and EXAM trials studied two additional compounds, \nvandetanib and cabozantinib, in advanced, unresectable, \nlocally advanced or metastatic MTC. The first randomized, \ndouble-blind, placebo controlled study (ZETA trial; NCT \n00410761) tested vandetanib and detected an increase in \nPFS (30.5 vs. 19.3 months for placebo) in the 331 patients \nrecruited to the study. Stratification of the patients by RET \nmutation suggested that there was an improved response \nin patients with RET M918T mutation and also in MTC \ncases with no RET mutation identified.[155] These data \nled to FDA and EMA approval for vandetanib for the \ntreatment of symptomatic or progressive, unresectable, \nlocally advanced or metastatic MTC. The EXAM trial \n(NCT00704730) was a randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo controlled study of cabozantinib in advanced \nand progressive MTC. This study recruited 330 patients \nand reported a median PFS of 11.2 months for treatment \nversus 4.0 months in controls.[156] The responses in this \ntrial were similar regardless of RET mutational status, and \nthe results from this trial led to FDA and EMA approval \nof cabozantinib for progressive, metastatic MTC. Another \ntyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib which has been \napproved for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, \nis now being studied as a second or third line therapy in \nMTC (NCT02657551). For recent, more comprehensive \nreviews of new molecular therapies and thyroid cancer \nclinical trials including those for MTC, see.[143,157]\nAlthough the genetic gain-of-function RET mutations are \nwell established as the basis for MTC, additional genetic \nstudies have been performed to understand the etiology of \n', '            Journal of Cancer Metastasis and Treatment ¦ Volume 2 ¦ August 17, 2016 ¦ 287\nRET mutation negative MTCs, and endocrine syndromerelated\nMTCs. Exome sequencing of 17 sporadic MTCs \nidentified the expected mutually exclusive RAS and \nRET mutations, but no other commonly occurring driver \nmutations.[148] Exome sequencing of MTCs associated \nwith MEN2A also identified the expected RET mutations, \nbut also suggested that low frequency mutations such as \nthose found in EIF4G1 may also play a role in MEN2Aassociated\ntumorigenesis by indirectly altering the RET \npathway.[158] A similar study was undertaken by Smith \net al.[159] in MTCs lacking an identifiable RET mutation. \nInterestingly, this group found a recurrent mutation in \nthe ESR2 gene which encodes the estrogen receptor beta \n(ER). Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and ER can form \nheterodimers and bind to estrogen response elements \nto regulate gene expression.[160] Alternatively, ER can \nantagonize the transcriptional activity of ER.[161-163] The \nRET gene contains three ERE sites that were shown to \nbe actively regulating RET gene expression in vitro. The \nauthors propose that this may be a novel mechanism by \nwhich the RET gene is regulated in RET mutation-negative \nfamilial MTC.[159] Heilmann et al.[164] performed genomic \nprofiling of MTC cases during the course of clinical \ncare and in addition to the expected RET mutations, \nalso identified amplifications of CCND1, FGF3, FGF19 \nand CDKN2A. The authors propose that these may be \ncooperating driver mutations impacting chemoresistance \nand disease outcomes.\nCancer stem cells have been identified in MTC cell lines \nthat are strongly positive for the cell surface antigen \nCD133 by immunohistochemistry.[165] Interestingly, cell \nlines with the M918T RET mutation produce the highest \nnumber of CD133+ stem-like cells.[165] This population of \nstem-like cells may also be involved in chemoresistance. \nIn a study by Kucerova, CD133+ cells from MTC cell lines \nwere no more chemoresistant than the parent population of \ncells. However, once the CD133+ cells were implanted in \nmice as xenografts and treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), \nthere emerged a new CD133+ stem-like cell population \nthat was resistant to subsequent 5-FU therapy and retained \nthese chemoresistant properties in culture.[166] MTCs are \nrelatively resistant to the radioactive iodine therapies used \nfor follicular and poorly differentiated thyroid cancers, \nand one group treated MTC stem cells with all-transretinoic\nacid (ATRA) to sensitize these cells to radioiodine \ntherapy. The stem cells identified and treated with ATRA \nincreased their uptake of iodine by 8 fold, suggesting \nthat ATRA pre-treatment followed by radioactive iodine \ntherapy may be a new treatment modality for MTC.[167] \nFinally, co-expression of CD133 and CD44 in MTC by \nimmunohistochemistry was correlated with decreased \noverall survival in a cohort of 51 MTC patients, compared \nto those with no co-expression of these two markers \nimplying that CD133 and CD44 can be used as prognostic \nmarkers for overall survival.[168]\nAt the molecular level, MTC cells express a variety of \nproteins including calcitonin and chromogranin A, as well \nas ASCL1 (also important in pulmonary NETs). Notch is \none of the pathways regulating the production of ASCL1, \nespecially during development. Notch1 expression is absent \nin MTC and overexpression of the Notch intracellular \ndomain decreases proliferation of MTC cell lines,[55] \nconsistent with its role as a tumor suppressor. Activation of \nNotch in MTC by pharmaceutical means became possible \nwhen valproic acid was reported to activate Notch in \nneuroblastoma cells[169] and subsequent work demonstrated \nthat valproic acid increased Notch1 signaling and induced \napoptosis in MTC cells.[170] Using a mouse model system, \nJaskula-Sztul et al.[171] demonstrated that activation of the \nNotch signaling pathway may be a therapeutic strategy for \nMTC. This same group expanded our knowledge of Notch \nsignaling in MTC by upregulating Notch3 in vitro and in \nvivo via NICD3 and the pharmacological HDAC inhibitor \nABA3. They demonstrated that Notch3, like Notch1, can \nalter the neuroendocrine phenotype in MTC, resulting \nin decreased proliferation and loss of NET markers.[172] \nResveratrol treatment of MTC cells suppresses growth, \ninduces apoptosis and reduces expression of chromogranin \nA and ASCL1 as a result of upregulation of Notch2.[173] In \nsimilar studies, thiocoraline treatment in vitro increases the \nexpression of Notch1 and Notch2 isoforms, as well as the \ndownstream Notch target genes HES1, HES2 and HEY1, \nwhile expression of HES6 decreased.[174] Taken together, \nthese studies indicate a clear role for Notch signaling in \nMTC therapy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe role of Notch signaling in NETs remains incompletely \nunderstood. Further study is required to understand how \nthis pathway impacts tumorigenesis and chemoresistance \nin this diverse tumor group. There is evidence that different \nNotch isoforms act as tumor suppressors in some NETs \nbut not others and paralog specific effects are understudied \nand remain unclear. The significant genetic heterogeneity \nof NETs suggests that individual molecular subtypes must \nbe studied separately to dissect the roles of Notch signaling \ncomponents and their potential therapeutic implications.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nThis work was supported by the Louisiana State University \nHealth Science Center School of Medicine, Department \nof Genetics.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1.
