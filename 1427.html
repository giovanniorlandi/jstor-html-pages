President, Roosevelt recently in, structed the interstate commerce commission to probe the, trouble between the railway companies and their employes,, to look into the conditions of which the employes com, plain and, if possible, bring about an adjustment, so as to, prevent the general railroad strikes with which the country, is threatened., The commission made apreliminary report, in response,, to the effect that the railroads had given assurance that, they will very shortly resume payment of the scale of, wages paid a year ago. This assurance it is hoped will, check the plans of the great strike that have been under, way for some time. The emplayes, however, declare that, they want some guarantee and also a definite date fixed for, the resumption., SCANDAL THREATENS WASHINGTON, (United Press Telegraph-Cable Service.), Washington, Feb. 22 ? Rumors are heard of a scandal, that threatens to eclipse anything of the kind that has, broken over the capital for many years. The first public, recognition of whisperings that have been heard about the, hotel lobbies for some weeks developed yesterday when Rep, resentative Lilley moved that the Holland Submarine Tor, pedo Boat company be investigated. The motion springs, from the belief that a majority of the members of the naval, committee are interested in the company. The company is, before congress for large appropriations for submarines., SKIM ELKS TO 60 TO JUNEAU, Sk&L way Lodge No. 431, Order of, Elks of this city, Thursday night, re, ceived an invitation to attend the, three days Dedication Ceremonies to, be held by Juneau Lodge No. 420, on or, about tbe 16th of March., i, The invitation was received with a, great deal *f enthusiasm as the local, Antlers have been waiting several, years for an opportunity to return the, compliment paid Skagway Lodge at the, time of the dedication of their beautiful, homo here., It is the intention of the local Elks to, make themselves clearly in evidence, durlug their stay in Juneau, and to that, end the following committees were ap, pointed at laat night\'s session of the, lodge to perfect arrangements for the, excursion:, Committee on Transportation, George, Blancbard, S, C.

The Market, Street Savings bank temporarily sus, pended this morning,, MOORS ROUT, FRENCH FORCE, (By United Pre??.), Paris, Feb. 22.? The French forccs, have been put to rout by Moors at Casa, Bianca. There are no details and great, anxiety is felt., Lieutenant Sam C. Orchard of the, Road Commission is disposed to make, light of the anxious fears expressed in, interviews in last evenings Alaskan as, 10 the New York to Paris automobilists, not being able to get over the Valdez, trail. Lt. Orcha d declares the trail is, in shape to accommodate the automo, biles in the matter of width and that at, only one place does he anticipate any, trouble on their part between Valdez, and Fairbanks ii they ever get so far as, the first named place. Said Lt. Or, chard today:?, "There is a place known as Teikhell, canyon, where the trail leads over the, ice ? the only place between Valdez and, Nome, save where it crosses streams,, that it does not take to tho ice? that, may give them trouble. If the ice was, late in freez\'ng there and the mushers, compelled to find a way around the wet, places, automobiles may be led a de, \'vious way over a trail that leads, through deep snow n t wide enough for, automobiles. But it is only a distance, of 3 or 4 miles at besthand by no means, impostible, of course. Teikhell canyon,, is 35 miles out of Valdez. From, Valdez to Workman there is, a fiae broad trail for any, purpose. There may be a little, trouble for them between Workman, and Saina, over Thompson\'s pass. The, freighters use double enders there., But the trail is level, three feet wide, and the siow is solid on both sides., If there is any trouble there it will be, between Siina and Beaver Dam. I do, not anticipate that they would find any, real difficulty, however. As to Icy, Point, the trail is plenty wide enough, and the sharp turn, referred to, is made, safe by a railing of iroa pipe at the, outer edge. There is no precipice. I, had a horse blown over the hill there, but he was picked up all right. From, Valdez to Nome the trail is all right., We have cut a good trail from Tan.na, to Koyukuk this year. There Is good, going all the way by land from Nulato, to Norton bay and Nome., "I would, of course, like to 9ee the, racers come this way,s\' said Lieutenant, Orchard, "but the route down the, Yukon, Dawson to Circ\'e arid across the, hills to Fairbanks, would be impractic, able and lead them aboyt 600 miles out, the way The distance by trail, Valdez, to Fairbanks, is 376 miles.", I, The boys\' club met last night at the, Presbyterian parsonage. The matter, of securing a room for basket ball was, reported upon by those haying it in, charge. Arrangements had been ef, fected with Mr. Abrahams and Mr. E., J. Shaw, agents for the Peterson build, ing at the corner of Fourth and State, whereby it is to be tendered the club, for tho me stated. The ground floor is, said to be very well adapted for the, purpose and it was decided to accept, the tender with thanks and to. proceed, at once to put the build!ng in shape for, use.

He had experiences that, would make the average "desert rat", turn pale. Not only were these ex, periences confined to Nevada but he was, in Alaska., In 1S92, before the discovery of gold,, he crossed the Chilkoot pass with an, Indian as a guide. Be and the Indian, made 3,600 miles oo foot, penetrating, far beyond the Arctic circle in quest, of data, etc., for the Smithsonian instl, tute. "Little Fred" koows all about, desert life as well as life in the extreme, north, and but few of those who have, the experience can lead them a fast?r, pice ttinn he is willing to follow., "We wish," writes the editor of the, Tartown Trumpet, "to correct an error, which crept into our issue of l?st week, In describing the unfortunue runaway, accident oa Main street, we wrote:, \'While waiting the arrival of the am, bilance, Doctor Skinner, who was for, tunately present, took the victim\'s, pulse.\' It was the printer who care, fully change J th) \'I, in the last word to, \'r\' We make this correction in justice, to Dr. Skinner, whose f?ss are always, .I0JB, . .r*, .SJS, . ?J0, . 9.00, moderate, and who never presents a, bill in advance.

This traveler declares from, knowledge that the whole coast line, north of Victoria is fretting against the, long Intervals between mailt, and ship, ments of merchandise; that business, is handicapped by the faulty sarvice, I, that prompt execution of orders is im, possible, and such a thing as "green, groceries" is out of the question. The, remedy for this state of affairs? which, obtained through last winter and, this ? is to go to Washington, as tbe, Alaskan has before stated, having such, evidence as exists in the sailing dates, of the ships and see to it that there is, inserted in the nextcontract a provision, that the mall be laid down here once, every four ? or at furthest live ? days,, rather than that each company shall, deliver It twice a month, under which, provision, Intended by the postofflce de, partment, of course, to work out the, same way. the compaales, while observ, ing the letter have snubbed both the, spirit of the contract and the people, ihey are supposed to serve., The meeting of citizens tonight will, doubtless take action along the lines, indicated.

Still, It was deeply Inspiring, to look out Into chaos, to hear the rush, and motion of atoms moving In vast, vortices, to learn that Inside the hard, est and most Impenetrable of sub, stances there was probably a feverish, Intensity of -lnuer motion. I do not, know that I acquired any precise, knowledge, but I drank deep drafts of, wonder and awe., The great man, with his amused and, weary smile, was Infinitely gentlo and, left me, I will say, far more conscious, of tho beauty and tho holiness of, knowledge. I said something to him, about the sense of power that such, knowledge must give. "Ah," he said,, "much of what I have told you Is not, proved; It Is only suspected. We are, very much In the dark about these, things yet. Probably If a physicist of, a hundred years hence could overhear, me he would be amazed to think that, a sensible man could make such puer, ile statements. Power? no, It Is not, that! It rather makes one realize, one\'s feebleness In being so uncertain, about things that are absolutely cer, tain and precise In themselves, if we, could but see the truth. It is much, more like the apostle who said: \'Lord,, I believe. Help thou my unbelief.\' The, thing one wonders at Is the courage of, the men who daro to think they, know."?
