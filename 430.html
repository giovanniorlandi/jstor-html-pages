Our forests of pine, now be\ning rushlessty destroyed, preserved\nand conserved, will more than meet\nour greatest demands, and our abun\ndant quarries remain unnoted and un\nused.

The Post says the pres\nent primary system has not raised the\nstandard of the public service, It baa\nfostered rather than prevented cor\nruption, It haa destroyed party Integ\nrity, prohibits a man from running for\ngovernor unless be Is rich, etc. There\nla beyond question more or less truth\nIn all the Post\'s charges against the\nprimary system, and yet over against\nthem there is one pre-eminent, out\nstanding principle of the primary that\noutweighs them all. That principle\nla, our officials are now nominated by\nthe whole people, while under the\nconvention plan they were nominated\nalmost entirely by the politicians. In\na nut shell, the convention system dis\nfranchises the people, and compared\nwith that one principle the charges of\nthe Post are but aa "sounding brass\nand tinkling cymbals."\nPrices on everything are not only\naa high aa a cat\'s back, but the qual\nity or many things offered for sale Is\naa poor as the price Is high.
