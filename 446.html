        <pre>['Helping learners engage with L2 words\nThe form–meaning fit\nJulie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\nFree University of Brussels / Erasmus University College\nThe pace at which new words are acquired is influenced by the degree of engagement \nwith them on the part of the learner. Insights from cognitive linguistics into the nonarbitrary\naspects of vocabulary can be turned into stimuli for such engagement. The \nmajority of Cognitive Linguists’ proposals for vocabulary teaching aim at helping learners\nappreciate the way a single word form can develop different meanings. This, however, \npresupposes knowledge of the ‘basic’ meaning of that word. We report an experiment \nin which learners under an experimental treatment were stimulated to consider the \npossibility that the form–meaning link in target words might not be fully arbitrary. The \nmnemonic effect of this task-induced engagement was assessed in relation to comparison \ntreatments in immediate and delayed post-tests measuring both receptive and productive \nknowledge. Results show that simply prompting learners to evaluate the form–meaning \nmatch of words can foster vocabulary acquisition, although not all target words lends \nthemselves equally well to this type of engagement.\nIntroduction\nThe chances of an L2 word becoming entrenched in long-term memory are influenced by the degree \nof cognitive (and affective) involvement on the part of the learner (e.g., Laufer & Hulstijn 2001). \nSchmitt (2008: 339–340) uses “engagement” as an umbrella term to refer to any activity on the part \nof the learner that involves more attention to or manipulation of lexical items. Others (e.g., Barcroft \n2002) have adopted the term “elaboration” to describe the various mental operations learners can perform\nwith regard to a lexical item. Learners can engage in such elaborative processing spontaneously, \nbut they may also benefit from teacher-initiated interventions that stimulate it. Such an intervention \nmay simply cater to the kind of elaboration which the learner would otherwise engage in spontaneously.\nAdditionally, the intervention may extend the scope of the given elaboration strategy to em-\nbrace more L2 words, or it might even reveal a pathway for elaborative processing which the learner \nhas not yet considered herself. We will illustrate this complementary relationship between learnerinitiated\nand teacher-prompted engagement with reference to the well-known keyword technique.\nIn this technique, learners associate an L2 word with a familiar word (usually an L1 word), \nand they use the latter as a key to retrieve the L2 word from memory (see Nation 2001: 311 ff. for \na review). A suitable keyword shows some phonological (and/or graphemic) resemblance to the \ntarget word (otherwise it would not assist in retrieving the L2 word form). The learner then creates\na semantic association between the keyword and the target word. In its simplest form, the L2 \nword could simply be a cognate (in which case the semantic association is very straightforward). \nAILA Review 23 (2010), 95–114. doi 10.1075/aila.23.06dec\nissn 1461–0213 / e-issn 1570–5595 © John Benjamins Publishing Company\n', '96 Julie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\nLearners are known to resort to cognates spontaneously (e.g., Hall 2002), but a teacher can guide \nthis type of engagement by pointing up suitable cognates for the learners. Crucially, the keyword \ntechnique extends beyond straightforward cognates that learners are likely to recognise themselves. \nMost often — especially when it is teacher-initiated — the technique rests on creative imagery to \nestablish connections between a target word and a keyword whose semantic relatedness is less than \ndirect. For example, a Dutch-speaking learner of English may be advised to associate the target noun \npuncture with the Dutch noun ‘puntje’ (meaning sharp end) because a punctured tyre and a sharp \npointed object can easily be pictured together in a single scene. She may be advised to associate the \ntarget verb frolic with the Dutch adjective ‘vrolijk’ (meaning merry) through an image of merrily \nfrolicking chimpanzees. She may be advised to associate the target adjective brave with the exclamation\n‘bravo!’, since brave acts merit an applause. These are the kinds of potentially useful mnemonic \nassociations which the learner might not have turned to when left to her own devices, and so it is \nthe intervention by the teacher (or materials writer) which helps her substantially stretch the use of \ncognates in the narrow sense.1\nIn the study we report below we shall explore the merits of an intervention which, unlike the \nkeyword technique, is not meant to teach learners a new mnemonic strategy in its own right, but \nrather to stimulate a type of engagement which learners may sometimes resort to spontaneously but \nwhose full potential is not yet realized. The intervention, in which learners are prompted to consider \nthe degree to which the form of a word might fit the word’s meaning, is placed in the framework of \napplied cognitive linguistics insofar as it relies on the thesis that language is far less arbitrary than \nhas often been assumed.\nThe contribution of applied cognitive linguistics so far\nThe principal contribution of pedagogy-oriented cognitive linguistics (CL) to L2 vocabulary instruction\nhas been to propose and validate interventions that exploit non-arbitrary dimensions of \nlexis. More particularly, several authors with a CL background have in recent years suggested methods\nof showing learners how seemingly distinct meanings and uses of a single word are actually \nrelated in ways that are ‘motivated’ (i.e., explainable in retrospect) (see Boers &Lindstromberg 2008a \nfor a review). In the CL view, polysemy is not at all the result of a word taking on new meanings in \na random fashion, but rather the outcome of semi-systematic meaning extensions from a word’s \n‘core’ sense. For example, familiarity with the physical-motion use of stumble may help learners appreciate\nthe ‘accidental’ nature of a discovery described figuratively as “she stumbled on a piece of \nevidence” (e.g., Lindstromberg & Boers 2005; Verspoor & Lowie 2003). CL case studies of motivated \npolysemy and their potential pedagogical applications have not only featured ‘content’ words, but \nalso such high-frequency ‘function’ words as prepositions. For example, a chain of meaning extensions\ncan readily be recognised from the literal use of over as in “the ball went over the hedge” via \na semi-figurative use as in “let’s discuss this over a beer” to the fully figurative use as in “they had a \ndispute over the use of Boolean networks” (cf. Boers & Demecheleer 1998; Cho 2010; Tyler & Evans \n2004; Lindstromberg 2010).\nIn addition to single words, multi-word items such as phrasal verbs and idioms have also been \nfound highly suitable targets for CL approaches to motivated polysemy. For example, the conventionalised,\nfigurative uses of expressions such as find out (the truth) and behind the scenes can be \nexplained with reference to conceptual metaphors such as knowing is seeing (e.g., Beréndi, Csábi \nand Kôvecses 2008; Boers 2000; Boers, Demecheleer & Eyckmans 2004; Condon 2008a; Hu & Fong \n2010; Kövecses & Szabó 1996; Skoufaki 2008). The results of several small-scale experiments collectively\nlend support to CL-inspired vocabulary instruction (see Boers & Lindstromberg 2009, \nCh. 5, for a review), although some questions remain as to the generalisability of the findings.2 \n', ' Helping learners engage with L2 words 97\nCL proponents will need to concede, however, that these proposed approaches focus on meanings, \nand more particularly extensions of meanings; they do not help learners much in the way of mapping \nthe initial form–meaning connection of the words at the root of those meaning extensions.\nAt the other extreme, some recent CL-connected endeavours have focused on certain nonarbitrary\nformal properties of lexis. One example of a minimally intrusive intervention in that regard \nis to briefly alert students to sound patterns such as alliteration in the multiword units they come \nacross in reading or listening texts (e.g., bunk bed, to wage war, time will tell) (Lindstromberg & \nBoers 2008a). Despite the brevity of the intervention, it appears sufficient to facilitate students’ recollection\nof the lexical makeup of multiword units that happen to display such phonemic repetition \n(on similar evidence regarding assonance, see Lindstromberg & Boers 2008b; on the high incidence \nof phonemic repetition in multiword lexis, see, e.g., Boers & Lindstromberg 2009, Ch. 6).\nAfter having found ways of exploiting motivated meaning–meaning connections (as in polysemy)\nand motivated form–form connections (as in alliterative multiword units), CL now faces \nthe challenge of finding form–meaning motivations that could be used to foster the initial stage of \nlearning new L2 words. Form–meaning matches are commonly referred to as cases of iconicity. As \none starts to consider the possibility that words might be iconic, one inevitably enters the field of \nsound symbolism.\nSound symbolism\nSound symbolism refers to non-arbitrary correspondences between phonology and semantics. Some \ntheorists have in fact speculated that early human languages were very much sound-symbolic, and \nthat arbitrary correspondences between semantics and phonology only developed with the need to \nexpand the linguistic means to express more complex messages (e.g., Lecron Foster 1978). Although \nsound symbolism now appears to be the exception rather than the rule in Indo-European languages \n(but see below), in many other languages of the world word classes (e.g., so-called ideophones; Doke \n1935: 118) remain that display strong systematic sound-meaning mappings (see Nuckols 1999 for a \nreview). Interestingly for language pedagogues, experimental research provides ample evidence that \nmany of the phonological patterns which descriptive linguists have intuited to be iconic are indeed \nexperienced as such by language users generally (see below).\nSound symbolism that is motivated extra-linguistically stands the best chance of being shared \nby many languages, and may therefore provide useful scaffolding in second language vocabulary \nlearning. Examples of sound symbolism that spring to mind most readily, of course, are onomatopoeia.\nThese indeed show a fair degree of resemblance across languages, although there is obviously \nalso some variation in the way they have been conventionalised (e.g. English cock-a-doodle-do vs. \nDutch kukeleku; English hiss vs. Dutch sissen). However, several other cases of potentially universal \nsound symbolism have been examined. One is that of ‘shape sound symbolism’ (e.g., Ramachandran \n& Hubbard 2001), for instance, where people are more likely to associate words containing rounded \nvowels (e.g., “bouba”) with rounded shapes and words containing unrounded vowels (e.g., “kiki”) \nwith angular shapes. The fact that this strong association has been attested not only in adults but \nalso in toddlers (Maurer, Pathman & Mondloch 2006) lends support to the thesis that it is more than \na mere by-product of language learning, i.e., of becoming accustomed to hearing and using words \nwhich happen to reflect this particular association.\nAn example of sound-symbolic use of consonants which is language-specific is the phenomenon\nof so-called phonesthemes (Bloomfield 1933). These are consonant clusters that recur in sev-\neral words that convey a similar idea. For example, the occurrence of /sw-/ in as many verbs as swab, \nsway, sweep, swing, swipe, swirl, swish, swivel, and swoop, is unlikely to be a coincidence. Bloomfield \n(1933: 245) lists several such sets of words that share a consonant-cluster onset that is potentially \n', '98 Julie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\nsound-symbolic (e.g., slime, slip, slide and crash, crack, crunch). In a series of experiments, Parault \n& Schwanenflugel (2006) presented adult speakers of English with sets of unfamiliar words which \n— on the basis of lists such as Bloomfield’s — were deemed to be either sound-symbolic or nonsound-symbolic.\nThe participants were encouraged to make guesses at the meaning of the words \nand to match the words with the appropriate definition in a multiple-choice task. The participants \nobtained significantly better scores on the sound-symbolic words than on the matched controls.\nIn many languages semantic and/or grammatical classes are signalled pretty systematically \nthrough sound. In Japanese, for example, different kinds of motion events are described by means \nof words that share the same combination of consonants. Imai et al. (2008) report a series of experiments\nin which participants were asked to match novel instances of Japanese motion words with \nactions displayed on video. This task posed no problems whatsoever for adult speakers of Japanese, \narguably because they were familiar with the language-specific conventions for marking different \nkinds of motion events. Young Japanese children obtained lower scores, but these were still significantly\nabove chance level. Interestingly, however, a group of adult speakers of English without any \nprior knowledge of Japanese also obtained significantly above-chance scores on the matching tasks. \nThis can only be explained with reference to a sound-symbolic effect that carries over across the \ntwo languages. Findings like these give reason to believe that learners’ appreciation of non-arbitrary \nsound-meaning connections might not only provide scaffolding for vocabulary acquisition in L1 but \npossibly also for vocabulary learning in L2.\nThe main research objective of this study is to explore the possibility of turning students’ subjective\nappreciation of the form–meaning motivation of words into a pathway for their engagement \nwith those words. To be clear, although we have resorted to research in sound symbolism as part \nof establishing the rationale for study, the study itself is not intended to provide objective evidence \nin support of iconicity per se. The nature of said appreciation may not be due to sound symbolism \nin any strict sense, but also by ‘coincidental’ resemblances with known words in the L1, the L2 or \nan additional familiar language (i.e., interlinguistic and/or intralinguistic associations). Hall (2002) \nreports evidence of learners’ spontaneous inclination to relate new L2 words to prior knowledge of \nword forms — in whichever language they have at their disposal — and their associated meanings. \nHulstijn (2001; 262) writes: “If a new word appears to the learner as having a form unrelated to its \nmeaning, it will need more attention and mental elaboration than if it has a transparent appearance.” \nIf it is true that language learners implicitly gauge whether a particular word meaning more or less \n‘fits’ the phonological (or graphemic) form they have somehow come to associate with (aspects of) \nthat meaning, then we ask whether this implicit evaluation could be turned into a conscious elaboration\nstrategy, benefiting the initial mapping of meaning onto the form of a new L2 word. This type of \nelaboration would be explicit, yet minimal in terms of time and cognitive investment.\nResearch questions\nOur general objective led to the following research questions:\n1. Does a prompted elaboration of the form–meaning connection of a new L2 word lead to higher \nlearning and retention gains as measured on a form recall test in relation to comparison treatments?\n2. Does a prompted elaboration of the form–meaning connection of a new L2 word lead to higher \nlearning and retention gains as measured on a meaning recall test in relation to comparison \ntreatments?\n3. Is the effect of this prompted form–meaning elaboration of a new L2 word influenced by the \ndegree of fit between the form and the meaning as perceived by the learners?\n', ' Helping learners engage with L2 words 99\nMost studies investigating either L1 word memory (e.g., Eagle & Leiter 1964; Hyde & Jenkins 1969) \nor L2 word learning (e.g., Barcroft 2002) have instructed subjects to engage with either the meaning\nof the target words (i.e., semantic elaboration), or the form (i.e., structural elaboration), but \nrarely to engage explicitly with the form–meaning connection.3 Expectations concerning the effect \nof drawing learners’ attention simultaneously to meaning and form depend on the processing model \none adheres to. Simply put, Levels of Processing theory (LOP) (Craik & Lockhart 1972) holds that \nsemantic elaboration induces superior processing to structural elaboration, in turn leading to better \nrecall on a test. Transfer-Appropriate-Processing theory (TAP) (Morris, Bransford & Franks 1977), \non the other hand, proposes that tasks which stimulate structural elaboration will result in better \nrecollection of form, whereas tasks that encourage semantic elaboration will result in better recollection\nof meaning. Lastly, Barcroft’s (2002, 2003, 2004) Type of Processing Resource Allocation \n(TOPRA) model holds that learners’ processing capacity is limited, so attention to word form would \nbe at the expense of the acquisition of meaning, and vice versa. In this light, as it seems to require \ndispersion of students’ attentional resources, the task of evaluating the form–meaning match of a \nnovel L2 word may arguably be overambitious. However, when participants are encouraged to process\nitems for ‘mapping’, this could stand them in good stead on a cued recall test, where the mapping \nof meaning onto form or vice versa is exactly what is required. It is this initial, but crucial, step in the \nword learning process that is under investigation in our study.\nDesign\nGeneral design\nThe experiment was designed as a between-subjects study which examined the effectiveness of three \ndifferent learning treatments on the cued recall of 24 new L2 words. The three treatments corresponded\nto the following three tasks:\n1. ‘Familiarity assessment’. The participants were told that they were helping the researchers with \na norming study to find out which of a series of words were likely to be unknown to learners of \na similar level of proficiency. This task was intended not to stimulate any particular elaborative \nprocessing of the words.\n2. ‘Form–meaning-fit assessment’. The participants were asked to evaluate the degree to which \nthey felt the form of L2 words they were presented with matched their meaning. This is the \nexperimental treatment we are putting to the test in this study.\n3. ‘Utility assessment’. The participants were told they were helping the researchers select words \nthey felt to be sufficiently useful to be included in a new advanced learners’ dictionary. This task \nwas intended to stimulate engagement with the meaning of the words, i.e., semantic elaboration.\nLike several previous L2 word learning studies (e.g., De Groot & Keijzer 2000; Lotto & de Groot \n1998; Schneider, Healy & Bourne 2002), we presented the new L2 words paired with their L1 translations.\nThe 24 target words were presented to the participants in two sets, separated by a break. After \nhaving tackled the first set according to one of the three tasks, the students were given an unannounced\npost-test. First the L1 word was given and participants were requested to produce the \ncorresponding L2 word (form recall, traditionally known as “productive” testing), and subsequently \nthe L2 word was given and participants were asked to provide the corresponding L1 word (meaning \nrecall, traditionally known as “receptive” testing).\n', '100 Julie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\nThe second set of words was tackled by the participants along the same task instruction they \nwere given for the first, but this time the participants knew there was going to be a test afterwards. \nOn the one hand, we wanted to include a sufficient number of L2 words to enhance the validity of \nany conclusions drawn from the results, and to enable us to estimate the scope of applicability of \nthe experimental treatment if it were shown to be effective. On the other hand, springing an unannounced\ntest on the participants after they had been presented with a considerable number of \nunknown words in a row risked yielding poor scores and thus a floor effect. The result of the set-up \nis thus a sequential combination of incidental and intentional learning conditions.4 Let it be clear \nfrom the start, however, that the experiment was not designed to compare gains under incidental \nand intentional learning conditions per se. For one thing, the target words in each set were different \nand not deliberately matched. For another, both sets of words were tackled in one session, and so fatigue\nwas more likely to affect performance on the second set (i.e., the intentionally studied words). \nIt is the effect of the form–meaning-fit-assessment task in comparison with other treatments that \nwe are interested in here. While it may be interesting to find out if this effect — if any — becomes \nmore noticeable if students perform the task purposefully as part of a mnemonic strategy, the results \nobtained from our study can only be suggestive in that regard.\nTwo weeks later, a delayed post-test was administered. This consisted of the same test items as \nthe immediate post-test. For a general outline of the experimental design, see Table 1.\nParticipants\nOur participants were 56 university students (20 male, 36 female) in Brussels, Belgium, enrolled in \nthe 1st or 2nd year of an English Language degree. Their average age was 20.2 (SD: 4.7), and their \nEnglish proficiency was judged by their teachers to approximate level B2 according to the descriptors\nin the Common European Framework of Reference. Participants’ native language was Dutch or \na combination of Dutch with another language, mostly French. All participants were highly experienced\nlanguage learners; in combination with English their university degree involved one other \nforeign language, and many of them reported working knowledge of at least one more additional \nlanguage. The experiment was carried out in four intact classes, and students were randomly assigned\nto one of three treatments: ‘familiarity assessment’ (n = 17); ‘form–meaning-fit assessment’ \n(n = 20), designed to induce an elaboration of the form–meaning connection; and ‘utility assessment’\n(n = 19), devised to encourage semantic elaboration. Two weeks later, 39 participants took \npart in the delayed post-test.\nGiven our choice of target words (see below), prior knowledge of these was extremely unlikely. \nAs far as their general proficiency in English was concerned, the three treatment groups were found \nwell matched on the basis of the students’ end of semester grades (p = .68).\nTarget words\nAs it was essential to control for prior word knowledge, 24 very rare, mostly obsolete words were \nculled from an obscure word list on the internet (http://www.obscurewords.com). These words were \nof various lengths, and they belonged to three word classes: nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The 8 \nnouns used in the study were: foppotee ‘idiot’, seraglio ‘palace’, welkin ‘sky’, yawd ‘mare’, meed ‘reward’,\nbandobast ‘settlement’, cant ‘hypocrisy’, mattoid ‘madman’. The 8 verbs were: blandish ‘flatter’, \nhie ‘leave’, sough ‘sigh’, tope ‘drink’, madefy ‘moisten’, vitiate ‘damage’, fub ‘postpone’, gledge ‘squint’. \nFinally, the 8 adjectives included in the study were: cinnabar ‘dark red’, voluble ‘talkative’, harageous \n‘brutal’, gibbous ‘round’, sere ‘dry’, mim ‘modest’, mellifluous ‘harmonious’, luculent ‘clear’.\nThese stimuli were not manipulated in any way or controlled for the effects of frequency, concept\nfamiliarity, imageability, cognate status, phonotactic regularity, or any other psycholinguistic \n', ' Helping learners engage with L2 words 101\naspect that could inform word memorability. We only ensured the 24 words were grouped into \ntwo groups of equal length, i.e., two series of 12 words each — constituting our separate sets which \nwould fuel either the incidental or the intentional learning condition —, comprising a total of 24 \nsyllables each.\nThe words targeted in our experiment were not selected on the basis of previously identified \nsound-symbolic patterns either. Neither did any of the authors — who shared the participants’ L1 — \nanticipate that any of the words was likely to call up an L1 cognate. Using a mixed bag of items adds \nto the ecological validity of the study, and it can help to estimate what fraction (if any) of (English) \nwords are amenable to the type of processing we are putting to the test here. Such an estimate would \nnot be possible if we were to use a pre-selection of likely sound-symbolic items (as was done by, e.g., \nParault & Schwanenflugel 2006).\nProcedure\nThe experiment was carried out in the participants’ regular computer classroom, during scheduled \nclass hours. At the start of the lesson students were informed, in Dutch, that they were taking part in \na survey, and that their answers would have no negative influence on their marks for English. They \nwere invited to sit down at a computer, to fill in a language background questionnaire, and to log \nonto the software programme (Question Mark Perception, version 3) using the individual log-in \nand password provided on their questionnaires. Unbeknownst to the students, this automatically — \nTable 1. General experimental design\n', '102 Julie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\nand randomly — assigned each of them to one of the three treatments/tasks: familiarity assessment, \nform–meaning-fit assessment or utility assessment.\nEach target word was then shown in the middle of the screen, accompanied by its translation. The \nstudents also heard the target word pronounced once. They were then given 12 seconds to perform \nthe task, which involved making an indication on a five-point Likert scale. Students assigned to the \nfamiliarity assessment treatment were asked to indicate the extent to which they were familiar with \nthe words. Students assigned to the form–meaning-fit assessment treatment indicated the degree to \nwhich they felt the form/sound of each word went together with its meaning. Students assigned to the \nutility assessment treatment rated the words according to how useful they felt them to be.\nAfter giving students the opportunity to ask questions about the procedure, a first set of 20 words, \nincluding 12 of our target words, was presented to them, and the students individually tackled their \nrespective rating tasks. The first 3 words given were ‘dummy’ items, so that participants could familiarize\nthemselves with the procedure, as well as to control for primacy effects. To counteract recency \neffects, the last 2 stimuli given were also excluded from the analyses. For affective reasons, we included \nin the set three filler words (‘pity’, ‘dwell’, ‘brave’) which we expected the students to be familiar with.\nThe presentation and rating of the first 20 words was followed by an unannounced, immediate \npost-test. This testing phase consisted of 2 blocks: a form recall test followed by a meaning recall test. \nIn the form recall test, learners were given 15 questions, each presenting the Dutch translation of an \nEnglish word they had just evaluated, as well as the first letter of said English word, and they were \nasked to produce it. After this test block, learners were presented with 15 questions again, each providing\nthe English word, and learners were then asked to provide the Dutch translation, for which they \nwere not given the first letter. This was the meaning recall test. Both testing blocks were self-paced.\nAfter completing this part of the assignment, participants were asked to note down on their \nquestionnaires whether they had expected to be tested on the vocabulary presented. None of the \nstudents reported in the affirmative.\nA short break was given, after which participants were invited to proceed with the second series \nof words. They were again instructed on the screen to carry out the rating exercise as in the previous\nseries but also — since they knew it was to be followed by a post-test — to do their best to learn \nthe words as well as they could. This time, the filler words that we expected the participants to be \nfamiliar with were ‘herd’, ‘toss’, ‘slender’. After the retention test on the second set of words (which \nfollowed the same pattern as the test administered after the first set), the students were thanked for \ntheir participation and told that they would be informed about their test results in due course.\nTwo weeks later, 39 original participants were given an unannounced delayed post-test, identical\nto the immediate one. The entire procedure lasted approximately 70 minutes (learning phase + \nimmediate post-test: 50 minutes; delayed post-test: 20 minutes).\nScoring and analysis\nFor the meaning recall test, dichotomous scoring was applied: one point was awarded to each word \ncorrectly and completely translated into Dutch, zero points to incorrect translations. In the case \nof the form recall test, however, we applied a less stringent scoring protocol. As participants were \nonly exposed to each lexical item once, and new words are learnt incrementally, we needed a recall \nmeasure that was sensitive to both complete and partial word learning. This measure was supplied \nby the well-established Lexical Production Scoring Protocol (Barcroft 2000), which awards .25, .50, \n.75, or 1 point to each word partially or completely produced (see Appendix). By giving the first letter\nof the target words and by asking the participants to try and reproduce the words they had been \npresented with in the previous stage of the experiment, we prevented the participants from filling in \nknown synonyms of the targets.\n', ' Helping learners engage with L2 words 103\nWe submitted the scores for each testing block to an analysis of variance (ANOVA). To provide \nan answer to all three research questions we needed to include both an analysis by participants and \none by items. As our selection of target words had not been controlled for item effects, we could not \nsimply compare students’ test scores obtained under the incidental with those under the intentional \nlearning condition (given the possibility that item effect might interact with learning condition). \nTherefore, the analysis by participants was run on the test scores for the two sets of 12 words separately,\nwith treatment (‘familiarity assessment’, ‘form–meaning-fit assessment, ‘utility assessment’) \nas between-subject factor and retention interval (immediate, delayed) as within-subject factor. The \nANOVA by items added learning condition (incidental, intentional) as a between-subject factor to \nthis model, but since the items were not crossed across learning condition, items were nested within \nthat factor to control for potential item effects.5\nResults\nAnalysis by participants\nForm Recall Scores\nIn the incidental learning condition (first series of words), the analysis reveals a significant effect of \ntreatment, with a moderate effect size: F(2,89) = 3.254, p < .05, η2 = .068. Table 2 shows recall rates \nacross conditions. It reveals that the form–meaning-fit-assessment group outperforms the two other \ngroups in both post-tests. The delayed post-test amplifies the divergence between our experimental \ngroup and the utility-assessment group.\nTable 2. Mean form recall rates across treatment groups and retention intervals (max score: 10) in the \nincidental learning condition.\nTreatment: ‘familiarity’ ‘form–meaning-fit’ ‘utility’\nn = 17 n = 20 n = 19\nRetention interval:\nimmediate 5.59 (1.67) 5.88 (1.47) 4.98 (2.47)\ndelayed 3.87 (2.02) 3.82 (1.21) 2.56 (2.05)\nThe average recall rates for words in the intentional learning condition (i.e., our second series of \nwords) across treatments and post-tests are shown in Table 3. The form–meaning-fit-assessment \ngroup outperforms the other two groups in both the immediate and the delayed post-test under this \ncondition as well. The divergence falls short of statistical significance, however, which could be due \nto the high standard deviations recorded.\nTable 3.

Moreover, the word meanings are retained \nremarkably well between the immediate and the delayed post test; there is no effect of retention \ninterval (p = .503).\nAs regards our second series of 12 words (intentional learning condition), the analysis does \nreveal a significant effect of retention interval, F(1,87) = 11.367, p = .001, η2 = .116. On the immediate\npost-test, the form–meaning-fit-assessment group returns a higher mean score (5.61) than the \nother two groups: 4.59 (familiarity assessment) and 5.21 (utility assessment). However, in the delayed\npost-test, the utility-assessment group shows less attrition than the others, with averages of 3.7 \nvs. 3.23 (form–meaning-fit assessment) vs. 3.23 (familiarity assessment) respectively. None of these \ndifferences are statistically significant, however, nor do they yield a significant interaction between \ntreatment and retention interval.\nAnalysis by items\nForm recall scores\nThe item analysis confirms the significant effect of treatment: F(2, 44) = 6.654, p = .003, η2 = .232. \nPost-hoc paired comparisons (Tukey) indicate that the difference between the form–meaning-fitassessment\ngroup and the familiarity-assessment group is significant at p = .022, and even highly \nsignificant at p < .0001 between the former and the utility-assessment group.

This is probably due to the divergence in recall rates obtained \nunder the familiarity-assessment treatment: they are relatively high for the incidentally learned \nwords but comparatively low for the intentionally learned words. Table 4 reveals a similar interaction\nbetween treatment and condition in the delayed form recall scores: it is with regard to the ‘in-\ntentionally’ learned words that the form–meaning-fit-assessment task appears mnemonically more \n', ' Helping learners engage with L2 words 105\neffective in the long term than both of the other tasks.

As expected, word meanings were \nmore likely to be recalled immediately after the presentation of the words than two weeks later, but \nthe attrition rate (which is similar in the three groups) is much less pronounced than in the case of \nform recall. It may look surprising that the word meanings of the 12 words presented in the incidental\nlearning condition were much better remembered than the 12 words shown in the intentional \nlearning condition, with means of 7.19 and 4.25, respectively (F(1,22) = 20.662, p < .0001, η2 = .484). \nHowever, the lack of uptake despite the anticipation of a post-test may in this experiment simply be \ndue to fatigue on the part of the students towards the end of the session, and we cannot be sure that \nthe learning burden of the two sets of target words was equivalent in the first place. Table 5 shows \nthat the retention interval had a much larger effect on the meaning recall of items that were learnt \nintentionally than on the items in the incidental condition; performance on the incidentally learned \nitems nudged downwards ever so slightly, whereas performance on the intentionally learned items \nplummeted.\nTable 5.

The average Likert score (on a scale from 1–5) given to our \n24 stimuli was 2.71 (1.35). We used this mean as a cut-off point to organize our items into a ‘more \nmotivated’ and a ‘less motivated’ group.\nThe 12 words in our ‘more motivated’ group were (in descending order according to motivation \nratings, standard deviations between brackets): harageous ‘brutal’: 4.2 (.83), voluble ‘talkative’: 3.7 \n(1.17), luculent ‘clear’: 3.58 (1.31), sere ‘dry’: 3.47 (1.22), mattoid ‘madman’: 3.37 (1.21), sough ‘sigh’: \n3.35 (1.23), foppotee ‘idiot’: 3.25 (1.25), welkin ‘sky’: 3.2 (.894), seraglio ‘palace’: 3.2 (1.32), mellifluous \n‘harmonious’: 3.11 (1.37), mim ‘modest’: 2.79 (1.48), blandish ‘flatter’: 2.74 (1.37).\nThe remaining 12 words in our ‘less motivated’ group were: tope ‘drink’: 2.5 (1.43), gledge ‘squint’: \n2.42 (.961), madefy ‘moisten’: 2.42 (.961), gibbous ‘round’: 2.3 (1.13), hie ‘leave’: 2.2 (1.47), fub ‘postpone’:\n1.95 (1.05), meed ‘reward’: 1.95 (1.18), cinnabar ‘dark red’: 1.85 (.745), vitiate ‘damage’: 1.84 \n(1.07), bandobast ‘settlement’: 1.84 (1.12), cant ‘hypocrisy’: 1.84 (1.35), yawd ‘mare’: 1.8 (1.06).\nCoincidentally, the 12 words from each of our 2 learning conditions (incidental and intentional)\nare equally distributed across these two groups, suggesting the items in each condition would \nhave appeared comparably motivated to our raters.\nWe analysed the item recall scores using analysis of variance (ANOVA), this time including \nmotivation strength (2) as between-subjects factor, and treatment (3) and retention interval (2) as \nwithin-subjects factors. Table 6 shows the recall scores for the ‘less motivated’ and ‘more motivated’ \n', '106 Julie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\nitems per treatment, collapsed across retention intervals. It reveals that most recall scores are remarkably\nsimilar across the board. This is confirmed by our analyses, which show neither a main \neffect of strength of motivation, nor a significant interaction effect between treatment and motivation\nstrength. However, a divergence between form recall scores is found among the ‘more moti-\nvated’ items: form recall scores for those items in the form–meaning-fit-assessment group are higher \n(4.54) than in the familiarity-assessment group (3.69), and considerably higher than in the utilityassessment\ngroup (3.09).\nWhen we split our data file and take an exclusive look at the form recall scores for the ‘motivated’\nitems, we do obtain a highly significant effect of treatment with a large effect size, F(2,66) = 8.254, \np = .001, η2 = .200. Graph\xa01 shows the effect of treatment on the form recall rates of ‘more motivated’ \nitems compared to the ‘less motivated’ items. Post-hoc analyses (Tukey) reveal that it is the divergence\nbetween the form–meaning-fit-assessment and utility-assessment groups that is most signifi-\ncant (p < .0001).

Each of the treatments involved \na rating exercise pertaining to the words, which for the participants in the familiarity-assessment \ngroup was intended to induce little elaboration of any particular kind, in the form–meaning-fitassessment\ngroup an engagement with the form–meaning connection, and in the utility-assessment \ngroup a semantic elaboration. The mnemonic effect of each treatment task was measured using immediate\nand delayed form and meaning recall tests over a two-week interval. The main findings will \nbe discussed with reference to the 3 research questions.\n1. Does the prompted elaboration of the form–meaning connection of a new L2 word lead to \nhigher learning and retention gains as measured on a form recall test in relation to comparison \ntreatments?\nOur form recall scores reveal a significant effect of treatment. The form–meaning-fit-assessment \ntask yields the highest form recall scores, in the immediate as well as the delayed post-test. This can \nprobably be attributed to the engagement with word form that this task is likely to induce in participants,\nin line with the principles of Transfer Appropriate Processing (TAP) (Morris, Bransford \n& Franks 1977). Cued form recall on a test is the first step on the way to fluent, productive word \nknowledge, and as such it charts the most challenging and elusive aspect of word learning (Laufer \n2005, 2006; Schmitt 2008). If the pedagogical aim is to enable learners to eventually use words productively,\nengagement with words must include a structural component. Moreover, an exclusive \nfocus on semantic elaboration is likely to inhibit word form learning (Barcroft 2002, 2003, 2004), \nand this is corroborated by the comparatively poor scores on the form-recall tests generated by the \nutility-assessment task. In fact, even the familiarity-assessment task, which was meant not to stimulate\nany particular elaboration, seems to yield better form recall than the utility-assessment task \n(although the difference in scores is not statistically significant). This substantiates the thesis that \nsemantic elaboration does not foster word form learning.\nThe superiority of our experimental treatment held out over time, although there was no interaction\neffect between treatment and retention interval, indicating attrition rates were similar across \ngroups.\n2. Does the elaboration of the form–meaning connection of a new L2 word lead to higher learning \nand retention gains as measured on a meaning recall test in relation to comparison treatments?\nBy rating words in terms of their usefulness to learners of English, participants in one of the two \ncomparison conditions, namely the utility-assessment group, were encouraged to think about the \nmeanings of these items, and possibly of available synonyms, thus inducing semantic elaboration. \nAccording to LOP-theory (Craik & Lockhart 1972), this engagement with meaning is expected \nto lead to superior results on a recall test in comparison to engagement with form. TAP-theory \n(Morris, Bransford & Franks 1977) posits that test scores are enhanced when testing measure is \ncongruent with learning condition. Hence, both theories predict comparatively good scores on the \nmeaning recall test after the utility-assessment task. On the other hand, learners who performed the \nform–meaning-fit-assessment task were coaxed into mapping meaning onto form, and so a cued \nmeaning recall test must be congruent with that learning mode also. The meaning recall scores \n', '108 Julie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\nturned out uncannily similar across the groups. This suggests that our experimental treatment does \nnot impede retention of semantics as compared to other treatments.\nThe performance of the familiarity-assessment group is perhaps the most surprising of all, especially\nin terms of the test scores on the items tackled in the incidental learning condition. This \ndoes not necessarily challenge the view that word meaning learning is always enhanced by engagement,\nas we cannot be sure that the participants in the familiarity-assessment task did not engage in \nany elaborative processing, despite the nature of the task.\nAttrition rates were similar across the board, as there was no interaction between treatment \nand retention interval.\nBefore concluding our discussion with regard to form and meaning recall scores, we need to \naddress how our findings relate to the TOPRA model (Barcroft 2002, 2003, 2004) of lexical processing.\nAfter all, the model predicts that attending to both form and meaning of lexical items leads to \nthe dispersion of students’ attentional resources. This would imply that meaning recall scores are \nimpaired by treatments that include attention to form as compared to treatments that target meaning\nexclusively. Yet this is not corroborated by our meaning recall results. Likewise, it may suggest \nthat treatments that include attention to meaning would inhibit form recall scores as compared to \ntreatments that solely fixate on form. As our study does not include an exclusively ‘form-focused’ \nelaboration treatment, this cannot be substantiated at present. But our results do not actually contradict\nthe TOPRA-model. Firstly, our experimental treatment does not induce participants to attend \nto form and meaning separately, but instead it encourages them to map them together — ‘processing \nfor mapping’ in the model. Secondly, our dependent measures were cued recall tests. These necessitate\nthe mapping of meaning onto form, in contrast to free recall tests, which, it could be argued, \ndo not chart L2 word learning at all.6 Of all the treatments induced, it is this ‘processing for mapping’\nthat is actually most congruent with a cued form and meaning recall tests, and its success is \ntherefore not so unexpected after all. Our results show that the high form recall scores obtained by \nthe form–meaning-fit-assessment group are not at the expense of meaning recall scores; unlike the \nutility-assessment task, our experimental task does not seem to trade off form recall gains for meaning\nrecall gains. This suggests that our proposed type of elaboration is effective in enhancing both \nform and meaning recall, at least for our group of learners.\n3. Is the effect of this prompted form–meaning elaboration of a new L2 word influenced by the \ndegree of fit between the form and the meaning as perceived by the learners?\nIn terms of form recall scores, the form–meaning-fit-assessment treatment was more effective for \nitems rated linguistically motivated by the participants than items that were less so (4.54 vs. 3.73). \nThis does not seem to be due to giving positive ratings to these words per se. If this were the case, \nthe words rated as useful by participants in the utility-assessment group should then have yielded \nbetter scores than those rated less useful, and no such differences were observed in the test scores \nof these participants.\nRather, the question arises as to whether the success of these motivated items in the experimental\ntreatment points to a possible congruence between internal and external salience. As pro-\nposed by Sharwood-Smith (1991, 1993), linguistic features that are noticed autonomously by the \nlearner have internally-created salience, necessitating no further instructional intervention. Externally-created\nsalience, on the other hand, is generated through pedagogical intervention, and is \nrequired when surface features are not noticed autonomously by the learner, whose attention then \nneeds to be drawn to said features. More empirical research is needed to ascertain whether spontaneously\noccurring salience has a different learning effect than when salience is deliberately engi-\nneered through instruction (Sharwood-Smith 1991: 121). However, it would certainly make sense to \n', ' Helping learners engage with L2 words 109\nconsider instruction optimal when it can capitalize on learners’ internal salience, forging a kind of \nharmony between the two types of salience (cf. Park & Han 2007: 110) (see also our brief discussion \nof the keyword technique in the introduction to this article). If the form–meaning connection of \nsome words appears more ‘naturally’ motivated to learners than others, explicitly attending to this \napparent motivation by way of a minimal, pedagogical intervention would certainly seem to capitalize\non its internal salience. Moreover, even though word motivation might be an idiosyncratic affair \nat times, the standard deviations recorded for our Likert motivation ratings are moderate, pointing \nto an acceptable inter-rater agreement for many of these items. This suggests that teachers’ subjective\nappreciations of form–meaning motivations could by and large be relied upon and provide the \nbasis for short pedagogical interventions. More research needs to be done to ascertain this.\nIncidentally, and interestingly in this respect, our filler items, i.e., toss, dwell, herd, pity, brave, \nand slender, scored very highly on this Likert scale for linguistic motivation; median 5. It suggests \nthat language users collapse ‘form’ and ‘meaning’ entirely when a word is known, i.e., when its form–\nmeaning connection is deeply entrenched and fluent.\nLimitations\nA number of possible restrictions constrain the generality of our study’s findings. First of all, the \ngroups of participants were relatively small, and each participant received only one of the three \ntypes of treatments. We were compelled to use this between-subject design rather than compare the \neffect of different treatments on the same individuals, because a pilot study had revealed that each \nof the tasks encroached too much on the following if assigned in combination. Given the small size \nof the groups, individual differences in learning styles may accidentally have impacted the relative \neffectiveness of this or that treatment.\nSecondly, whether the rating tasks given to the learners are good operationalizations of the \nconstructs of ‘zero elaboration’, ‘form–meaning elaboration’ and ‘meaning elaboration’ is subject to \ndebate. We deemed it essential for each treatment to involve a similar mental and motor task; i.e., \nassess the word on a scale, but we wanted the quality and quantity of the induced elaboration to be \ndifferent. The most important concern in this respect is raised by the familiarity-assessment task, \nwhich we thought came close to a ‘zero elaboration’ treatment. Yet assessing to what extent one \n‘knows’ a word might imply a type of elaboration after all, which, if induced, would involve attending\nto both meaning and form, as it encourages a reflection on the learner’s side whether meaning \nand form are already associated with one other, presumably on the basis of possible previous encounters\nwith the word — or similar words — in question.\nLastly, operational constraints also meant that our 12 words in the incidental learning condition\nwere different from our 12 words in the intentional learning condition, yet identical for each \ntreatment group, and presented in the same order. It may come as a surprise that recall scores were \nhigher in the incidental learning condition than in the intentional learning condition (see the tables \nin the results section), but the effect of intentional learning is likely to have been eclipsed by other \nvariables, such as primacy effects, fatigue and memory crowding. Given the different variables at \nplay, we cannot say at this stage whether the effectiveness of our proposed pedagogical intervention \nis influenced by type of motivation for learning.\nConclusion and implications for vocabulary learning and teaching\nOur study suggests that an evaluation of the linguistic motivation of a word’s form–meaning link can \nbe an effective form of elaboration. As such, it could be turned into a conscious, simple, and time-efficient\nword learning strategy, providing an extra pathway to strengthen the form–meaning mapping \nof a new word. Lexical items whose form–meaning link is perceived to be motivated are particularly \n', '110 Julie Deconinck, Frank Boers and June Eyckmans\namenable to it. The ‘processing for mapping’ induced by our form–meaning-fit assessment appears \nequally beneficial for the learning and retention of word meaning as word form, with neither aspect \nof word knowledge being established at the expense of the other. What’s more, findings suggest it has \na competitive edge over comparison treatments when it comes to learning word form.\nIn terms of vocabulary teaching, the appreciation of the form–meaning motivation of words \ndoes not need to be scientific or universally shared; as long as it is there for a particular learner, it \ncan have mnemonic potential (cf. Croft 1978). Still, the degree of agreement among our participants \non which of the items were relatively motivated suggest that — for lack of a thesaurus of ‘transparent’\nwords — teachers could rely on their subjective appreciations of form–meaning motivations to \njustify short pedagogical interventions.7 We propose that an elaboration of the form–meaning connection\ncan help to enhance the mapping of meaning onto form and vice versa. As there may not be \na 1:1 correspondence between meanings in the L1 and the L2, further semantic fine-tuning could \nstill be required. Nor may this initial mapping be sufficient to achieve fluent word knowledge, but it \ndoes constitute the first essential step — or leap — towards it.\nTeachers’ interventions to tap this resource can be very simple and brief. For example, on encountering\nan unfamiliar L2 word during a classroom activity, the teacher might pronounce this \nword in a tone of voice that is compatible with the word’s ‘connotations’, and with exaggerated articulation\nor lengthening of certain phonological features to hint at a certain degree of iconicity. One \ncan do this with words as varied as slime, whisper and smooth. This kind of minimal intervention \non an as-the-opportunity-arises basis is reminiscent of what Lindstromberg & Boers (2008a) have \nfound to be measurably effective when applied to alliterative phrases. The auditory stimulus for \nelaboration can of course go hand in hand with others, such as awareness-raising of morphological \nclues (as pro and long in prolonged) and semi-cognates (as ‘vol’ in voluptuous — Dutch ‘vol’ means \nfull). Student involvement can easily be invited when a phonestheme is encountered: on encountering\nthe word swirl the teacher can easily ask students to pool other sw- verbs they happen to know \nand contemplate what semantic feature they have in common with the new word.\nBut also in exercises designed to teach vocabulary more directly, potential form–meaning fits \ncan perhaps be put to good use, and more particularly to help avoid the risk of erroneous initial \nform–meaning correspondences. For example, matching exercises (e.g., connecting L2 words to \ncorresponding L1 words or corresponding L2 synonyms) can be pedagogically sound only if the \nrisk of erroneous matches is minimized. One way of doing this is by making sure that only some of \nthe items in the exercise are new to the learners. A supplementary way suggested indirectly by the \nresults of our study may be to reduce blind guessing by selecting words for the exercise that display a \ncertain degree of form–meaning-fit. Whether a given word is suitable in this respect may have to be \ntested through piloting, however. This piloting would ideally have to be done with same-population \nstudents. As we mentioned in the introduction, whether or not the form–meaning connection of \na given L2 word is perceived as ‘motivated’ is likely to be partially determined by cognate effects.\nWhat we have attempted to do in this contribution is to complement the existing CL approaches \nto teaching L2 vocabulary, most of which exploit meaning–meaning motivation (as in polysemy) and \nsome form–form motivation (as in alliterative word partnerships), by exploring the pedagogical potential\nof form–meaning motivation. Our intention has not been to provide evidence of iconicity per \nse, but rather to investigate whether making learners consider the possibility of such iconicity is a fruitful\nway of stimulating engagement with L2 words. We believe the preliminary results are encouraging.\nSuggestions for further research\nA qualitative follow-up study is warranted to answer a number of questions. We wish to know \nwhether the advantage of the experimental treatment for form recall is possibly informed by an \n', ' Helping learners engage with L2 words 111\naffective dimension that the other two treatments might not afford. Reactions by the students indicated\nthat they enjoyed the rating exercise, but further study could investigate to what extent they \nalso appreciate the relevance of it, and how straightforward or natural it seems to them. Furthermore,\nthe validity of our conclusions could be explored for students at lower levels of proficiency \nand with different learner characteristics. Finally, qualitative data could reveal whether individual \nlearners can ‘motivate’ their ratings, be it on the basis of sound symbolism, loanwords and cognates, \nor idiosyncratic associations.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Hélène Stengers for her invaluable assistance with QuestionMark Perception \n(3).

Last but not least we are grateful to the \nstudents who took part in the experiment.\nNotes\n1. Some investigations of the keyword technique suggest that its efficiency decreases as the semantic link \nbetween keyword and target word becomes far-fetched (e.g., Wang & Thomas 1995).\n2. Laufer (2005) likens the difference between the systematic teaching of pre-selected vocabulary (e.g., \nthrough word translation exercises) and the more occasional targeting of vocabulary during communicative \nactivities to the distinction that in contexts of grammar instruction has become known as ‘focus on forms’ \nand ‘focus on form’, respectively (Long 1991). It is not always clear where CL proposals for language pedagogy \nare to be situated in this framework, although the input materials used in most CL experiments to date seem \nto suggest leanings toward forms-focused instruction.\n3. To operationalize the construct of semantic elaboration, a significant number of studies have instructed \nparticipants to rate the experimental words in terms of the pleasantness of their referents (e.g., Barcroft 2002, \nin line with previous L1 experiments). Whether participants are able to divorce meaning entirely from the \nformal properties of these words in this kind of exercise, however, has never been ascertained.\n4. In accordance with Hulstijn (2001: 266 f.), we have operationalized the difference between incidental and \nintentional learning as the absence or presence of a warning to participants that they will be tested afterwards.\n5. A nested design is an experimental design in which the variables are not crossed, but have an implicit \nhierarchy. In our case, words 1–12 are nested (i.e., embedded) within the ‘incidental’ learning condition, and \nwords 13–24 are nested within the ‘intentional’ learning condition.\n6. Recalling the forms of target L2 words freely after a treatment is no evidence of word learning if you do \nnot know what they mean, and recalling the meanings of target L2 words freely (i.e., by producing known L1 \nwords) suggests you have a good episodic memory.\n7. Given the likelihood that a fair number of subjective form–meaning associations might be due to cognate \neffects in a broad sense, the chances that a teacher’s appreciation of such appreciations will correspond to the \nlearners’ may be reduced if the teacher is unfamiliar with the learners’ L1.\nReferences\nBarcroft, J. 2002.
