But alack and\nalas! they are all Republicans.\nWe had grown so used to having the Republican men lay claim\nto all the brains of the world that it had ceased to chafe, but we had\nhoned when women were enfranchised that somehow the matter i\nof "best minds" would be more evenly balanced between the two\nparties.\nIt is true, however, that Democratic women showed a strange\nlack of brain power when it came to picketing the president, being\nimprisoned, shouting traitorous sentiments before the visiting Rus\nsian delegation (which, by the way, is considered by many though\ntful people to have been the last straw which broke the back of the\nRussian government and allowed Bolshevism to have full sway) and\n(Otherwise acting like a lot of rowdy, undisciplined children.\nThe selection of Mrs. "Winter, president of the National Federa\ntion of Women\'s Clubs, was a wise and just one, for she is not only\na brainy woman, but represents the club women of the nation. How\never, in the Appeal\'s humble opinion, there are several women march\ning under the Democratic banner, who are the equal, if not the super\nior, of at least one of the other three Republican women named.\nNo one expected President Harding to go 50-50 in the appoint\nments, but surely one out of four was the least courtesy he could\nhave extended to Democratic women.\n"AGENDA"\nSince the call for a conference by President Harding on the lim\nitation of armament by the world\'s nations the word "agenda" has\nbeen bruited through the columns of all the papers that take heed of\npublic affairs.\n\' Using the Century dictionary as authority, "Agendum," singu\nlar; "Agenda" plural, is something to be done. Specificially (a)\nItems of business to be brought before a committee, council board,\netc., as things to be done, (b) Matters of practice, as opposed to\n"credenda," or matters of belief.\nIt is obvious that any session of the magnitude of the one involv\ned must have a definite plan, and to this end the "agenda" or\nprogram, lias been submitted unofficially to the delegates of the\ninvited nations, who in turn are discussing and laying plans to ac\ncept or reject it after the formal opening of the conference.\nIt is known that the delegations from at least two of the nations\nparticipating, have agenda of their own, but it is-only a matter of\ncommon courtesy for the inviting nation to present its program first.\nIt is not to be expected that America\'s agenda will be accepted\nin its entirety, but the following is the outline of the one that will\nbe presented at the opening of the disarmament conference on No\nvember 12th :\nLimitation of Armament\nLimitation of naval armaments, under which shall be dis-\nSALESMEN WANTED\nThe Laws of Economy\nAn apple bounced off Newton\'s head and inspired him to evolve\nthe Law of Gravity. -The advertisements in this paper can give you\nno less forcefully the inside workings of the Laws of Economy.\nAs sure as the apple hit Newton, the advertisements have a per\nsonal message of economy ior you.\nMerchants tell you of their bargains through advertisements.\nAlmost every new opportunity is offered through an advertise\nment.

Mandated islands.\nEASTERN PAPERS ON "COLONEL" HARVEY\n(Philadelphia Public Ledger, Rep.\n(eorge Harvey, American ambassador to the Court of St. James,\nmaking his first public\' appearance in London last Hay at a banquet\ngiven in his honor by the Pilgrims, made a speech which before he\nhad done witli it produced considerable trouble for him. Liberal ex\ntracts from the speech were cabled to this country; and as soon as the\nsense of some of the things he said had invaded the minds of our\npeople protests began to arise. They soon reached considerable vol\nume; but then, as is the way of the world, the people began to forget\nas other matters came along to claim their attention.\nIt has just been demonstrated, however, that not even yet has\nthe bad taste left in many an American mouth by our ambassador\'s\nremarks completely disappeared. One of the most important actions\nof the closing day of the American Legion convention in Kansas City\nwas the adoption of a resolution condemning Colonel Harvey and his\nspeech. There were, in fact, two resolutions on the subject. The first\none was bitterly denunciatory of the colonel and contained rather\npersonal allusions. It was defeated on these grounds. When the\nsecond, calm and dignified in tone, was presented, however, it was\nadopted by a unanimous vote of the convention and ordered forward\nid to the president in duplicate.\nThe portion of Colonel Harvey\'s remarks which American public\nsentiment objected to was that which dealt with America\'s motives\nfor entering the war. A short extract will serve to recall the view\npoint from which the subject was treated. Colouel Harvey said :\nEven to this day, at rare intervals, an ebullient sophomore seeks ap\nplause by shouting that "We won the war !" Far more prevalent until\nrecently was the impression that we went to war to rescue humanity\nfrom all kinds of menacing perils. Xot a few remain convinced that we\nsent our young .soldiers across to save this kingdom, France and Italy.\nThat is not the fact. We sent them solely to save the United States of\nAmerica, and most reluctantly and laggardly at that. We were not too\nproud to fight, whatever that may mean. We were afraid not to fight.\nThat is the real truth of the matter.\nIn other words, Colonel Harvey butchered American idealism to\nmake an international holiday for cynicism. And it has been made\napparent that the American people did not relish being interpreted\nin terms of cynicism. For the American Legion to show this resent\nment lives to this very day is to furnish an object lesson perhaps not\naltogether superfluous. Ve are a young and vigorous-bodied nation\nlooking ahead into the ages and not a nation tired out by conflict with\npast centuries. It is apparent that we are not yet prepared to wel\ncome in our public men a school of cynic statesmanship.\nNew York World, Dem.\nAmbassador Harvey, summed up his version of why the United\nStates entered the war when he told the people of England that "We\nwere afraid not to fight. That is the real truth of the matter; and\nso we came along toward the end and helped you and your allies\nshorten the war. That is all we did and all we claim to have done."\nAfter scrapping one red-hot resolution in reply to Mr. Harvey\nand making a determined effort to moderate its language in order to\npreserve an appearance of courtesy toward an important official, the\nconvention of the American Legion states its contrary version, as fol\nlows :\nThat the sentiments expressed by George Harvey, United States\nambassador to Great Britain, in his Pilgrim Day speech setting forth\nthe reasons for Aemrica\'s entry into the World war and the cause for\nwhich America fought, do not represent the true American attitude as in\nterpreted by the American Legion; and let it be known for all time that\nAmerica fought not only for the maintenance of America\'s rights, but for\nthe freedom of the world, and\' that a copy of this resolution be sent to\nthe president of the United States.\nThese are only the words of the American Legion, and the Legion\nis composed, to be sure, of men who walked in ranks rather than of\nmen who sat in at important councils. It may be that several gen\ntlemen and officers of Colonel Harvey\'s opinion gathered somewhere\nin an office and decided among themselves early in 1917 that the war\nwas to be fought, not to save democracy, but to save our own skins.\nIt" so, the decision was never published and nobody boasted about it J\nat the time. The country and the boys who went to France were un-1\nder the impression that the war was a war to save democracy and a\nwar to end Avars. It did save the democracy of France; it did over\nthrow the Hoheuzollerns. What influence it may have on ending\nwars is yet to be seen.\nThere would have been little enthusiasm in 1917 for a Avar which\nthe country fought because it Avas afraid not to fight. Was that, af\nter all, why the young men volunteered or submitted cheerfully to\nthe draft"? Not if those who did the fighting kneAv what they Avere\nfighting for, and they seem to know, as Colonel Harvey can ascertain\nfor himself by reading the Legion resolutions.\nSQUEEZED\nTO DEATH\nWhen the body begins to stiffen\nand movement becomes painful it\nis usually an indication that the\nkidneys are out of order.
