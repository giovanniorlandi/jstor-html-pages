The\nconcept of association rule mining can be extended in web mining environment to find associations between web pages visited\ntogether by the internet users in their browsing sessions. The weighted fuzzy association rule mining techniques are capable of\nfinding natural associations between items by considering the significance of their presence in a transaction.The significance of an\nitem in a transaction is usually referred as the weight of an item in the transaction and finding associations between such weighted\nitems is called fuzzy weighted association rule mining. In this paper, we are presenting a novel web classification algorithm using\nthe principles of fuzzy association rule mining to classify the web pages into different web categories, depending on the manner in\nwhich they appear in user sessions.The results are finally represented in the form of classification rules and these rules are compared\nwith the result generated using famous Boolean Apriori association rule mining algorithm.\n1. Introduction\nClassification is a Data Mining function that assigns items\nin a collection to target categories or classes. The goal of\nclassification is to accurately predict the target class for each\ncase in the data. For example, a classification model could be\nused to identify loan applicants in a bank as low, medium,\nor high credit risks. A classification task begins with a data\nset in which the class assignments are known. A classification\nmodel that predicts credit risk could be developed based\non observed data for many loan applicants over a period\nof time. In addition to the historical credit rating, the data\nmight track employment history, home ownership or rental,\nyears of residence, number and type of investments, and so\non. Credit rating would be the target, the other attributes\nwould be the predictors, and the data for each customer\nwould constitute a case. Classification techniques include\ndecision trees, association rules, fuzzy systems, and neural\nnetworks. Classification has many applications in customer\nsegmentation, business modeling, marketing, credit analysis,\nweb mining and biomedical, and drug response modeling.\nClassification models include decision trees, Bayesian\nmodels, association rules, and neural nets. Although association\nrules have been predominantly used for data exploration\nand description, the interest in using them for prediction\nhas rapidly increased in the Data Mining community. When\nclassification models are constructed from rules, often they\nare represented as a decision list (a list of rules where\nthe order of rules corresponds to the significance of the\nrules). Classification rules are of the form ùëÉ ‚Üí ùëê, where\nùëÉ is a pattern in the training data and ùëê is a predefined\nclass label (target) [1]. Association rule based classification\nis introduced by Liu et al. [2]. Association rule mining\nalgorithm like Apriori can be used for generating rules and\na second algorithm is used for building the classifier. The\nrules generated by association rules are called classification\nassociation rules (CARs), as they have a predefined class label\nor target. From the generated CARs, a subset is selected based\non the heuristic criterion that the subset of rules can classify\nthe training set accurately.\nServers register a Web log entry for every single access\nthey get, in which important pieces of information about\n', '2 ISRN Artificial Intelligence\naccessing are recorded, including the URL requested, the IP\naddress fromwhich the request originated, and a time-stamp.\nApplying Data Mining techniques on this web log data can\nreveal many interesting knowledge about the web users [3].\nThese web log data shows information accessed by the users\nand give their surfing pattern.WhenDataMining techniques\nare implemented on these logs to extract hidden patterns\nbetween the URLs requested by the users [4], it is commonly\nknown as Web Usage Mining. In recent years there has been\nan increasing interest and a growing body of work in Web\nusage mining [5] as an underlying approach in capturing and\nmodeling Web user behavioral patterns and for deriving ebusiness\nintelligence. Web usage mining techniques rely on\noffline pattern discovery from user transactions. These techniques\ncan be used to improveWeb personalization based on\nhistoric browsing patters. Association rule mining can bring\nout precise information about user‚Äôs navigational behavior.\nWhen we apply the association rule mining techniques with\nweb log file, the result will be of the form ùëã ‚Üí ùëå where\nùëã and ùëå are URLs [6]. It means if a user accesses URL ùëã\nthen he would be accessing URL ùëå most likely. The user‚Äôs\nnavigational pattern information can be used in predictive\nprefetching of pages and web personalization. Development\nof such recommendation systems has become an active\nresearch area. Some recent studies have considered the use\nof association rule mining [7] in recommender systems\n[8, 9].\nIn this work, the association rule mining techniques are\nused for web classification based on the navigational patterns.\nA novel web classification algorithm is presented here, which\nis developed on the foundations of fuzzy association rule\nmining techniques. The concepts of weighted fuzzy transactions\nand fuzzy support and confidence framework are\nused to derive this algorithm. This associative classification\nalgorithm finds longest possible access sequence patterns\nwhich lead to a web category. Here, each web category is\nconsidered as a class label.These identified classification rules\ncan be later used for web personalization and predictive\nprefetching. The Boolean Apriori algorithm also used in the\nsame framework to find access sequences which lead to a\nparticular web category as the consequent. The results are\ncompared and it is found that the new algorithm identifies\nmore natural patterns.\n2. Background and Related Work\nIn Data Mining area, general classification algorithms were\ndesigned to deal with transaction-like data. Such data has a\ndifferent format from the sequential data, where the concept\nof an attribute has to be carefully considered.The associationrule\nrepresentation is an extensively studied topic in Data\nMining. Association rules were proposed to capture the\nco-occurrence of buying different items in a supermarket\nshopping. It is natural to use association rule generation to\nrelate pages that aremost often referenced together in a single\nserver session [6]. In the association rule mining literature,\nweights of items are treated as insignificant until recently\nand a common weight of one (1) is assigned as a common\npractice. Some of the very recent approaches generalize\nthis and give item weights to reflect their significance to\nthe user. In weighted association rule mining, the weights\nmay be as a result of particular promotions for the items\nor their profitability, and so forth, [10]. Fuzzy weighted\nsupport, confidence, and transactions are also defined in a\nfuzzy association rule framework [11, 12]. The concepts and\nmethods used in weighted association rule mining can be\nextended to web mining [13].\nMuyeba et al. [12] presented a novel approach for effectively\nmining weighted fuzzy association rules [14]. The\nauthors address the issue of weight of each item according\nto its significance with respect to some user defined criteria.\nMost works on weighted association rule mining do not\naddress the downward closure property while some make\nassumptions to validate the property. This paper generalizes\nthe weighted association rule mining problem with binary\nand fuzzy attributes with weighted settings. This methodology\nfollows an Apriori approach but employs T-tree data\nstructure to improve efficiency of counting item sets. The\nauthors‚Äô approach avoids preprocessing and postprocessing\nas opposed to most weighted association rule mining\nalgorithms, thus eliminating the extra steps during rules\ngeneration. The paper also presents experimental results\non both synthetic and real-data sets and a discussion on\nevaluating the proposed approach.\nIn Boolean Apriori algorithm, all the products are\ntreated uniformly, and all the rules are mined based on the\noccurrences of the products. However, in the social science\nresearch, the analystsmaywant tomine the rules based on the\nimportance of the products, items or attributes. For example,\ntotal income attribute is more interesting than the height of a\nperson in a household. Based on this generalized idea [15, 16],\nthe items are given weights to reflect the importance to the\nusers.Thedownward closure property of the supportmeasure\nin the mining of association rules no longer exists in this\napproach. Here, they make use of a metric, called support\nbounds, in the mining of weighted fuzzy association rules.\nFurthermore, the authors introduce a simple sample method\nand the data maintenance method, based on the statistical\napproach, to mine the rules.\nMobasher et al. [4] proposed an effective and scalable\ntechnique for Web personalization based on association rule\ndiscovery from usage data. Here, the association rules are\nused for the development of a recommender system. In this\nwork they proposed a scalable framework for recommender\nsystems using association rule mining from click stream\ndata. The recommendation algorithm utilizes a special data\nstructure to produce recommendations efficiently in realtime,\nwithout the need to generate all association rules from\nfrequent item sets. This method can overcome some of\nthe limitations of low coverage resulting from high support\nthresholds or larger user histories and reduced accuracy due\nto the sparse nature of the data.\nSuneetha and Krishnamoorti [17] suggested an improved\nversion of Apriori algorithm to extracts interesting correlations,\nfrequent patterns, and associations among web pages\nvisited by users in their browsing sessions. In order to reduce\nrepetitive disk read, a novel method of top down approach\n', 'ISRN Artificial Intelligence 3\nis proposed in this paper. The improved version of Apriori\nalgorithm greatly reduces the data base scans and avoids\ngeneration of unnecessary patterns which reduces data base\nscan, time and space consumption. Kumar and Rukmani\n[18] used Apriori algorithm for web usage mining and in\nparticular focuses on discovering the web usage patterns of\nwebsites from the server log files. In this work the memory\nusage and time usage of Apriori algorithm are compared with\nfrequent pattern growth algorithm.\nRamli generates the university E Learning (UUM Educare)\nportal usage patterns using basic association rules\nalgorithm called Apriori algorithm [19]. Server log files are\nused with Apriori algorithm to produce the final results.\nHere, web usage mining, approach has been combined with\nthe basic association rule, Apriori algorithm to optimize the\ncontent of the university E Learning portal. The authors\nhave identified several Web access pattern by applying the\nwell known Apriori algorithm to the access log file data\nof this educational portal. This includes descriptive statistic\nand association Rules for the portal including support and\nconfidence to represent the Web usage and user behavior for\nUUMEducare.The results and findings for this experimental\nanalysis can be used by the Web administration and content\ndevelopers in order to plan the upgrading and enhancement\nto the portal presentation.\nMei-Ling Shyu and Shu-Ching Chen proposed a new\napproach for mining user access patterns. The approach\naims at predicting Web page requests on the website in\norder to reduce the access time and to assist the users in\nbrowsing within the website [20]. To capture the user access\nbehavior on the website, an alternative structure of the Web\nis constructed from user access sequences obtained from\nthe server logs, as opposed to static structural hyperlinks.\nTheir approach consists of twomajor steps. First, the shortest\npath algorithm in graph theory is applied to find the distances\nbetween Web pages. In order to capture user access\nbehavior on the Web, the distances are derived from user\naccess sequences, as opposed to static structural hyperlinks.\nThey refer to these distances as minimum reaching distance\n(MRD) information. The association rule mining (ARM)\ntechnique is then applied to form a set of predictive rules\nwhich are further refined and pruned by using the MRD\ninformation. In this paper, finally they propose a newmethod\nfor mining user access patterns that allows the prediction of\nmultiple nonconsecutiveWeb pages, that is, any pages within\nthe website.\nSrivastava et al. [21], proposed a data mining technique\nfor finding frequently used web pages. These pages may be\nkept in a server‚Äôs cache to speed up web access. Existing\ntechniques of selecting pages to be cached do not capture a\nuser‚Äôs surfing patterns correctly. Here, they use a weighted\nassociation rule (WAR) mining technique that finds pages\nof the user‚Äôs current interest and cache them to give faster\nnet access [5]. This approach captures both user‚Äôs habit and\ninterest as compared to other approaches where emphasis is\nonly on habit. If user A logs on to Internet every day for\nreading news and checking emails. He visits googlenews.com\nand gmail.com in any order. In this case, association rule\nwould give rules (User A, googlenews.com) ‚Üí (User A,\ngmail.com) and gmail can be pre-fetched to the cache to\nreduce the access time.\nAmong these classification methods in Data Mining,\nAssociation rule mining is simple and effective in classification.\nIn fact rules generated from association rule mining\ncan be easily converted to classification rules so it becomes\na natural choice for classification in Data Mining. This\ntechnique is known as associative classification [1]. In the\nresearch work [22], the author focused on the construction\nof classification models based on association rules. In order\nto mine only rules that can be used for classification, the\nwell-known association rule mining Apriori algorithm is\nmodified to handle user-defined input constraints. Using\nthis characterization, a classification system is implemented\nbased on association rules. In this work, the performance\nof this classification method is compared with the performance\nof several model construction methods, including\nCBA (classification based on association). This classification\nalgorithm mines for the best possible rules above a userdefined\nminimum confidence and within a desired range for\nthe number of rules.\n3. Finding Weighted Associations\nfrom Web Logs\nWe model the pieces of Web logs as sequences of events\nto find the associations between web pages on the basis of\nsequential patterns over a period of time. Each sequence is\nrepresented as an ordered list of discrete symbols and each\nsymbol represents one of several possible categories of web\npages requested by the user. Let ùê∏ be a set of events. A\nWeb log piece or (Web) access sequence ùëÜ = ùëí\n1\n, ùëí\n2\n, . . . ., ùëí\nùëõ\n(ùëí\nùëñ\n‚àà ùê∏) for (1 ‚â§ ùëñ ‚â§ ùëõ) is a sequence of events, while\nùëõ is called the length of the access sequence. An access\nsequence with length ùëõ is also called an ùëõ-sequence. In an\naccess sequence ùëÜ, repetition is allowed. Duplicate references\nto a page in a web access sequence imply back traversals,\nrefreshes or reloads [6, 23]. For example, 1, 1, 2 and 1, 2 are\ntwo different access sequences, in which 1 and 2 are two\nevents. Figure 1 shows a sample of such sequence. The Data\nwe used for the experiment comes from Internet Information\nserver (IIS) logs for msbc.com and news related portions of\nmsn.com for one entire day. Each sequence in the data set\ncorresponds to page views of a user during that day. There\nare 1 million records and we selected 64,000 samples. Each\nevent in the sequence corresponds to a request for a page.\nRequests are recorded only at the level of page category.\nThere are 16 categories of pages and these categories are given\nnumeric codes from 1 to 16.The pages are included into one of\nthese categories based on their content. These categories are\nfront page(1), news(2), technology(3), local(4), opinion(5),\non air(6), miscellaneous(7), weather(8), health(9), living(10),\nbusiness(11), sports(12), summary(13), bbs(14), and travel(15),\nmsn news(16). Although other information pertaining to the\nweb access is available, we model only the categories of page\nrequests.\nWhen we try to find the hidden patterns in web access\nsequence using the Boolean association, we can consider\n', '4 ISRN Artificial Intelligence\nFigure 1: Web access sequences where numeric symbols are used to\nrepresent web pages.\nonly the presence or absence of pages in an access sequence.\nWe do not give importance for the number of occurrences\nof a category of web pages in a sequence. If a particular\ncategory of web page is appearing together continuously\nthen such occurrences also have to be processed with more\nsignificance. Instead of Apriori algorithm, if we use weighted\nfuzzy association rule mining algorithms, we will be able\nmodel the web sequences which reveal more natural patterns\nby considering all the above mentioned facts.\nFrom Figure 1 it is clear that the weight of a category\nof web page in a browsing session of a user can be directly\nassociated with the number of times the user visits that\nparticular category of pages in his session. Again if the user\nis continuously visiting the same category of pages thenmore\nweight has to be given for such continuous accessing of same\ncategory of pages. Considering the above facts we define\nthe following concepts for the development of the new web\nclassification algorithm.\n3.1. Definition 1. FuzzyWeight of Web Page. The fuzzy weight\nof a web page is defined by considering the number of cooccurrences\nof a web category. The following expression is\nused for weight calculation:\nùúá\nùëñ\n=\nùëõ\nùëñ\n‚àó‚àè\nùëö\nùëó=1\nùëò\nùëó\nùëõ\n, (1)\nwhere ùúá\nùëñ\nis the fuzzy weight of the ùëñth category web pages\nin a session. Here, we assume that there are ùëö subgroups\nin a sequence which contains the ùëñth category web pages.\nThen ùëò\nùëó\nis the number of successive ùëñth category web pages\nappearing in the ùëòth group and ùëõ\nùëñ\nis the total number of ùëñth\npages appearing in the session under consideration. Finally\nùëõ is the total number of pages in the browsing session. The\nweight thus generated will be more than one in some cases\nand the values are normalized by dividing each weight with\nthe maximumweight in a session. A portion of the values are\ngiven in Table 1.\n3.2. Definition 2. Web Class of a Session. The class of a web\nsequence is defined as the web category in a sequence with\nmaximumweight. It is assumed that in aweb access sequence,\nthe remaining page visits are leading to this web category\nwith maximum weight. In an association rule framework,\nthe page categorywithmaximumweight can be considered as\nthe consequent and the remaining pages as the antecedents.\nA web class WC\nùëñ\nfor an access sequence ùëÜ\nùëñ\nis defined as\nWC\nùëñ\n= Max (ùëÜ\nùëñ\n(ùúá)) . (2)\nSo, this concept work like a data mining classification problem\nwhere the available sequence patterns are classified into\ngroups leading to a particular class and this information can\nbe later used to predict the user behavior in browsing sessions.\nUsing the above mentioned equation, all the web pages\nin the access patterns are converted into their corresponding\nweights. In this new approach, the web pages visited in a\nsession are given weights, after considering the number of\nvisits in that session and the extend of continuous visits of the\nsame category of pages. The weights obtained in each session\nare normalized so that all the weights appear within the range\nof 0 and 1. Sincewehave sixteen categories ofwebpages, a new\ndatabase table is created with sixteen attributes such that each\nattribute corresponds to a web category. All the sequences are\nconverted into this fixed database table format withmatching\nweights for each category. All the weights are normalized as\nshown in Table 1 so that they appear within a range of zero\nand one.\n4. The Fuzzy Web Classification\nAlgorithm (FWCA)\nWith the concept of web page weight and web access class,\nnow the new algorithm for web classification can be derived.\nThe algorithm has the following steps.\nStep 1. Convert all the web pages in access sequences to\ncorresponding fuzzy weights in a fixed database table format.\nStep 2. Sort each web sequence in the descending order of\nweights and select the web page with maximumweight as the\nclass (consequent) of a sequence.\nStep 3. For each access sequence, the remaining pages (other\nthan the consequent) are included into a classification rule\nsequence as long as the product of the weights is greater than\na given support threshold.\nStep 4. Select only those rules having the confidence value\n(associated with the number of times such rule sequences\nexist in the entire set of web access sequences) greater than\nthe user specified threshold. The confidence for the ùëóth rule\nfor the ùëñth web category ùê∂\nùëóùëñ\nis defined as\nùê∂\nùëóùëñ\n=\nùë†\nùëóùëñ\n‚àó ùëõ\nùëóùëñ\nùëõ\nùëñ\n, (3)\nwhere ùë†\nùëóùëñ\nis support of ùëóth rule for ùëñth web category ùëõ\nùëóùëñ\nis\nnumber of ùëóth rules identified for the ùëñth web category ùëõ\nùëñ\nis\ntotal number of rules with ùëñ as the web class.\nIn Algorithm 1, we have the detailed pseudo code for the\nalgorithm. In the algorithm,ùëä[ùëõ][ùëù] is the weights of ùëù page\ncategories for the ùëõ browsing sessions. Weight is calculated\n', 'ISRN Artificial Intelligence 5\nTable 1: Web groups and corresponding weights in browsing sessions.\nSeq no.

The web page categories are included in to the\nrules (as antecedents in the association rule) in the order they\nare arranged.\nWe have a variable support and its initial value is the\nweight of the consequent.When oneweb category is included\nin to the rule its weight is multiplied with the support value.\nWhen the support becomes smaller than the given threshold\nalpha (‚àû) the rule generation for that user session is stopped.\nThe next user session sequence is considered for the same\nprocess and this is done for all the available user session\nsequences and finally there will be ‚Äúùëõ‚Äù rules. In the next step,\nthe global confidence of rules is checked.\nSince the web categories are included into the rules as\nantecedents in the descending order of their weights, only\nthe most significant web categories in a user session will\nbe included into the rule generated for that session. Once\nall rules are generated, their global confidence count is\nfound (the number of times the same antecedent-consequent\nsequence appears in the entire sessions). All the rules with\nconfidences lesser than the user specified threshold beta are\nremoved from the set of rules. By applying the weighted\nassociation rule mining approach to the webmining problem\nwe could identify fifty five rules from one 64000 sessions\nthese rules are given in (Table 2).\n5. Finding Web Page Associations Using\nApriori Algorithm\nTo find the Boolean associations between the co-occurrences\nof the web pages, first we converted the entire web sequences\ninto true or false values. Since there are sixteen categories\nof web pages, here also we designed a database with sixteen\nfields. The presence and absence of a web page in a sequence\nis represented with true or false values in the corresponding\nrecord representing the web sequence. In this approach,\nwe are considering only the presence of a web page in\nthe sequence and we do not give any significance for the\nnumber of occurrences of the page in the sequence. With\nthis preprocessing, the web sequence database is converted\nin to a true Boolean database with only true or false values\nindicating the presence and absence of web pages in the user\nsessions. Table 3 shows a portion of such Boolean database\ngenerated.\nTo apply the Apriori algorithm to the new dataset we used\nthe IBM SPSSModeler 14.1 data mining software.The Table 4\n', '6 ISRN Artificial Intelligence\nAlgorithm FWCA (ùëõ, ùëù)\n{\n// ùëõ is the number of access sequence\n//ùëù is the number of web categories\n//ùëä[ùëõ, ùëù] is the weights of web pages for ùëõ sessions\n// seq[ùëõ, ùëù] is the rules generated\nfor ùëñ = 1 to ùëõ\n{\nforùëó = 1 to ùëù\n{\nùë§[ùëñ, ùëó] = weight(ùëñ, ùëù)\n}\n}\nSort (ùë§[ùëõ, ùëù])\nrule = 1\nfor ùëñ = 1 to ùëõ\n{\nùëò = 2\nSupport = (Max(ùëä[ùëñ, 1 . . . ùëù]))\nwhile support‚â•‚àû\n{\nwm = (Max(ùëä[ùëñ, ùëò . . . ùëù]))\nSeq[rule, ùëò] = Addwebtype(wm)\nSupport = support‚àówm\nDelete(wm)\nùëò = ùëò + 1\n}\nRule = rule + 1\n}\nfor ùëñ = 1 to rule\n{\nif confidence(seq[ùëñ, ùëù]) > ùõΩ\nprint(seq[ùëñ, ùëù])\n}\n}\nAlgorithm 1: The new algorithm used for web classification.\nrepresents the rules identified using Apriori algorithm. By\napplying Apriori algorithm, 45 rules were identified with a\nsupport value of 5 and confidence of 20. Among the rules,\nonly seven are having more than one antecedent.\nBy comparing the rules generated fromboth themethods,\nit is clear that the fuzzy weighted approach for associative\nclassification using the new proposed algorithm is far superior\nto Boolean Apriori Algorithm. This is in terms of the\ncoverage of the rules and inclusion of web categories into\nthe classification rules. In the case of Apriori algorithm we\ngot only two antecedents in five cases and only one in all\nthe remaining cases but in the case of weighted approach\nmany rules are having more than three web categories as\nantecedents.\n6.

The data used in\nthis work contains sixteenweb categories and 64,000 samples\nof web access sequences involving these web categories. Some\nof theweb categories are highly popular amongweb users that\nthese web categories appear in several access patterns. The\nimportance of web categories is evident from the graphical\nrepresentations (Figures 2 and 3) which are directly linked\nwith the number of occurrences of web categories in access\nsequences.\nFigure 2 shows the number of sequences in which the web\ncategories appear. The Figure 3 is the total occurrences web\ncategories in different sequences (a web category may appear\nmany times in a sequence). From the figures it is clear that\nsome of theweb categories aremore important in comparison\nwith others. The concept of importance of web categories\nin access sequences is modeled using the concept of fuzzy\nweight of web categories (Table 1).\nIn this paper, the associations are found between the web\ncategories using conventional Boolean Apriori algorithm and\nthe FWCA. By using the new algorithm, fifty-five rules are\nidentified and forty-five rules are identified using Apriori\nalgorithm. It is found that the rules generated using the\nFWCA algorithm havemore coverage (classification rules are\nidentified for more web categories) and it identified classification\nrules leading to fifteen web categories. A comparison\nbetween the two techniques in terms of the number of rules\nidentified from each web category is given in Figure 4.\nTable 4: The rules identified using apriori algorithm.\nUsing Boolean Apriori algorithm\nNo. Rules Support Confidence\n1 11‚Üí 1 5.97 57.39\n2 10‚Üí 1 5.00 53.21\n3 7‚Üí 1 8.01 46.56\n4 2‚Üí 1 17.76 42.99\n5 12‚Üí 1 11.18 39.35\n6 14‚Üí 1 11.96 34.09\n7 4‚Üí 1 12.43 33.05\n8 3‚Üí 1 12.38 27.48\n9 6‚Üí 1 21.84 18.88\n10 15‚Üí 1 21.84 18.88\n11 10‚Üí 2 5.00 34.53\n12 11‚Üí 2 5.97 30.88\n13 7‚Üí 2 8.01 24.28\n14 6‚Üí 2 32.19 23.72\n15 4‚Üí 2 12.43 22.23\n16 12‚Üí 2 11.18 21.04\n17 3‚Üí 2 12.38 20.23\n18 14‚Üí 2 11.96 16.14\n19 1‚Üí 3 7.64 18.96\n20 12‚Üí 3 5.00 18.36\n21 7‚Üí 4 8.01 33.40\n22 3, 6‚Üí 4 7.64 22.02\n23 9‚Üí 4 9.10 21.29\n24 11‚Üí 4 5.97 19.32\n25 10‚Üí 4 5.00 17.89\n26 2‚Üí 4 17.76 15.56\n27 1, 7‚Üí 6 8.01 40.31\n28 15‚Üí 6 5.00 27.53\n29 1, 2‚Üí 6 7.64 20.69\n30 11‚Üí 6 5.97 19.29\n31 4‚Üí 6 12.43 17.30\n32 9‚Üí 6 9.10 16.89\n33 4‚Üí 7 12.43 21.53\n34 1, 2‚Üí 7 7.64 16.94\n35 6, 7‚Üí 9 8.01 16.47\n36 3‚Üí 9 12.43 15.59\n37 2, 7‚Üí 10 7.64 15.83\n38 12‚Üí 11 7.64 18.07\n39 2‚Üí 12 7.64 20.30\n40 15‚Üí 12 5.97 19.09\n41 10‚Üí 12 5.00 18.03\n42 14‚Üí 13 11.96 15.25\n43 13‚Üí 14 7.78 23.44\n44 2‚Üí 14 7.64 16.48\n45 11‚Üí 14 5.97 15.93\nThe classification rules generated using the techniques\nshow the associations between the web categories.

The\nbenefits of this method are listed as follows.\n(i) In a web access sequence the importance of web\ncategories vary according to the user preferences. By\nusing FWCA, we can assign more weight-age for\nfrequently visited pages by uses. This consideration\nwill help in evolving rule which represent natural\naccess habits.\n(ii) In the experiment, There are sixteen categories of\nweb pages. A classification rule generation system for\nthis sample data is efficient if it can identify rules\nwhich lead to most these web categories. FWCA\nidentified rules which lead to fifteen web categories.\nApriori algorithm identified rules for only eleven web\ncategories.\n(iii) These web classification rules can be used for prediction\nand selective prefetching of web pages. The rules\nwill become useful if more number of web categories\nare involved in the rules. Using FWCA, more web\ncategories are included as antecedents in the rules.\nIt helps in identifying wide range of associations\nbetween web categories.\n(iv) The number of sequences in which the antecedents of\na rule appear together from the sample sequences (the\nsupport count) is more in the case of FWCA. It shows\nthat the rules generated by the algorithm are exactly\nrevealing the access patterns of users.\n(v) The number of sequences which actually satisfy\nthe rules (Confidence measure) from the sample\nis also more for FWCA. It proves that that the\nrules generated by the algorithm are correct, that is,\nthe antecedent sequences identified by the rules are\nleading to the web category of the rule.\nThemain advantage of this algorithm is that it can identify\nthe longest possible frequent patterns in a single step by using\nthe concepts of fuzzy weighted association, while the Apriori\nalgorithm requires many passes over the data to generate the\nrules.\n7. Summary\nThe concept of a market basket can be extended as the pages\nvisited by a user in one session in web mining. Association\nrule mining techniques are used here to find associations\nbetween web pages visited by users. Here the problem\nis redefined like which pages are most frequently visited\nsimultaneously by web users?The Boolean Apriori algorithm\nfor association rule mining is used to find the association\nbetween the web pages visited together by users. But by using\nApriori algorithm, only the presence and absence of web\npages in a browsing session is considered. But, we also have\nto consider other important factors like the number visits of a\nweb category, the time spent on a web page, and so forth,This\npaper discussed about a novel web classification algorithm\nusing the principles of fuzzy association rule mining to\nclassify the web pages into different classes in a single step,\ndepending on the manner in which they appear in user\nsessions. In this approach, page visits in a browsing sessions\nare converted into fuzzy weighted values and association\nrules are generated from this. These fuzzy rules are used to\nclassify access patterns in the form of classification rules.\nReferences\n[1] J. Han, M. Kamber, and J.
