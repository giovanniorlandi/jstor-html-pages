Anna \'Kolar Ma He\n6 Interesting\nTimes for ..Sheriff ., Welch .and\nDeputies. x•\nAnna Kolar, who lives on Fourth\nstreet north "of the E\'ranklin hotel,\nfurnished interest, not to say amuse\xad\nment for Sheriff Welch and several\ndeputies last evening when -the sheriff\nwent to serve a warrant of arrest upon\nher tor aiding and abetting the escape\nof Graham, the prisoner who \'escaped\nfrom the county jail and took refuge.\nUnder the house in which she lives\nuntil he was discovered there by the\nsheriff. Not long after Graham\'s dis\xad\ncovery by the officers, the woman be\xad\ncame frenzied, either with anger over\nhis discovery or some other emotion,\nand Dr. F. R. Smyth was summoned\nto attend her. After some difficulty\nthe doctor succeeded in quieting her\nand the woman went to sleep. In the\nmeantime the sheriff had sworn out a\nwarrant for her arrest on a charge\nof abetting the escape of Graham,\nand went up to serve it. He* found\nthe Woman asleep and left the house\nbut had not proceeded far before one\nof the children ran after him to say\nthat the woman was again In a fury.\nWith Bob Cotton of Wilton Sheriff\nWelch went back to make the arrest.\nThey found\' the woman in a state of\nfrenzy, and in her fury .she attacked\nthe officers as they entered the house,\nwith sticks, dulis, hot Water, stove\nlids and every other weapon that lay\nwithin her grasp. The unusual com\xad\nmotion attracted a large crowd of\nspectators, and from within the house\nthe woman made a vicious attack up\xad\non every one wiho attempted to molest\nher. She threw a pailful of boiling\nwater\' at the sheriff, but it missed\nhtm and part of the scalding fluid\nstruck a bystander on the leg. Sub\xad\nsequently she threw the tea kettle full\nof boiling water at the sheriff but\nagain\'h€| managed to dodge. Part of\nthe time she stood\' on the bed and\nthrew missiles of various descriptions\nat the crowd. At length the woman\nwas taken into custody and taken to\nthe county jail where she is now con\xad\nfined. Shie was furious during the\nnight, tearing up bed clothing and\notherwise venting her rage.\nThe woman has five children, three\nof whom hare been living with her\nhere. Her husband is said to be an\ninmate of the Stillwater penitentiary\nand his brother is in the North Dakota,\npenitentiary. Graham is also a\' peni-1\ntentiary graduate and has made her\nhome a place of refuge out of prison\nseason. The children have been\ntaken to the Grittenton home for care\nwhile the woman\' is in jail.\nThe woman has made life a burden\nfor the officers both in McLean \\md\nBurleigh county while Graham has\nbeen in jail, and after his second es\xad\ncape and the discovery of Graham un\xad\nder her \'house, Sheriff Welch deter\xad\nmined to .put an end to the nuisance\nby swearing out a warrant for the\nwoman.\nTOO MUCH FOR "U" TEAM.\nBismarck Defeated Grand Forks Uni\xad\nversity Team By Score of 14\nto 0.\nThe Grand Forks University team\nmet the Bismarck team on the*local\ngrounds last night and when they\ncame down from the balloon the score\nwas 14 to 0 with the Grand Forks team\nholding the sack. The team from the\nuniversity was badly outclassed in the\nplaying laat evening and never had a\nchance from the first inning. One\nman got as far as the third base in\nthe ninth inning but there were two\nout when he arrived there and Middle\nton settled\' down to buisiness add\nstruck out the third man, nipping this\nchance in the bud. At the opening of\nthe game the Grand\' Forkers threat\xad\nened to do things. The first man up\nrapped out a single, but the succeed\xad\ning batsman attempted to sacrifice\nand the runner was thrown out at\nsecond. Fast fielding retired the side\nwithout a tally. Grand Forks started\nbadly in the field. The first Bismarck\nbatsman drew a pass. A pair of safe\nhits, another pass, and two or three\nglaring errors and Bismarck had\nscored 6 runs before: the side was re\xad\ntired. From then cm the game was\nuninteresting. Grand Forks never\nhad a chance to score. Brown, third\nbaseman,, gobbled up everything that\ncame into his territjxry, and although\na few hits were made off Middleton\nthey unproductive.^\'\nSupretpa Court Handa Down Daolaion\nIn Caca of Peter Plct+t vs. Caaa\nCounty.:\n,: The supreme oonrt has handed\n4oim decision tn the case of Peter\nPloton Cass county, holding the\nWoods 4a* lanr to be constltutkwaL\nThe syllabus of the decision is as\nfollows:\n1 Chapter lfl, laws of 1909, which\nprovides for tht enfatoement of\' pay\xad\nment, by judicial proeeediM« of taxe«\nivon, real property sold to the state\n.n\nJs&T\n.i ... \'•••••."• %"f 5|.»s^.?\'..!V*:.\'rT:--\' -v.5 -rvV r^/- p: \'".v-if-:\nor oounity and remaining unredeemed\nfor more than three years, and gives\'\ni» the several boards of county com\xad\nmissioners of all counties\'in the state\na discretionary authority to institute\nthe proceedings therein provided for,\nis not vulnerable to the objection that\nit delegates legislative power to said\nboards.
