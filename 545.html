        <pre>['The Roswele Daily Record,\nVOLUME 2.\nRos well, New Mexico Friday Evening Sept. -16 -1904\nNUMBER -170\nSEE $4.20 LINE OF MEN\'S SUITS Al FORSYTH & CO.\'S CLOSING OUT SALE.\nON THE\nADVANCE\nJAPANESE ARE AGAIN MOVING\nON KUROPATKIN.\nAT PORT ARTHUR\nSaid to Be Twenty-Four Thousand\nRussians in Hospital. Provisions\nare Scarce and the Garrison is on\nHalf Rations. The Men Want to\nSurrender.\nAdvices from Mukden and official\nreports to St. Petersburg indicate\nthat the Japanese forces are again\non the move. Kuropatkin\'s reconnois\nsances establish the fact that they\nare massing on his east flank and\nthat bodies of Japanese are moving\nup the Liao river valley. St. Peters\nburg, however, still believes that a\nserious engagement is not immediate\nly at hand, but that it will require\nsome weeks for Oyama to be in shape\nfor another attack. In the mean\nwhile the Russians continue to forti\nfy Tiao pass, and statements that\nKuropatkin will not abandon Mukden\nare received in St. Petersburg with\nsome skepticism. St. Petersburg ex\npects the Japanese to now redouble\ntheir efforts before Port Arthur and\nanother sortie of the fleet is expec\nted. N\nSt. Petersburg, Sept. 16. A tele\ngram from Harbin says the follow\ning has been received from Port Ar\nthur: "Our garrison is in good spir\nits and there is no prospects of the\nprovisions failing. Port Arthur is pre\npared for a long siege."\nNews from the front is exceedingly\nmeagre, and the present lull in the\noperations in Manchuria is expecte-l\nto continue for several weeks. It is\nstated that Oyama will require con\nsiderable time to reorganize his ad\nvance, and it is believed he will\nawait leinforcements from Japan of\nmen and guns to make good his loss\nes at Liao Yang. These it is reportaJ\nwill not be ready ,to start from Ja\npan before the end of the month. In\nthe meantime, General Kuropatkin\nis also receiving reinforcements.\nGeneral Kuropatkin reports that\nreconnoissances have established the\nfact that the Japanese are massing\nnear Yentai and Bentsoaputze. Bodies\nof Japanese troops are also moving\nin the Liao river valley.\nMukden, (Thursday) Sept. 15.\nAccording to information from Chi\nnese sources the Japanese are lead\ning .the garrison at Liao Yang and\ntheir main forces are moving on the\nRussian flanks. The whole Chinese\npopulation of Liao Yang is working\non the Japanese defenses.\nJapanese Demand Will Increase.\nParis. Sept. 16. The Matin today\npublished a long interview with Bar\non Haashi, the Japanese minister\nin London, who is quoted as saying,\n"Before .the war we demanded that\nRussian recognize China\'s sovereign\nty over Manchuria. Today, after pur\nvictories" and expenses : we are no\n, longer content with our . former de\nmand. After the fall of Port Arthur\nour conditions will be still more ex\ntreme, and after taking Vladivostock\nthey will be yet more so. The next\nbattle will be at Tiao pass. We shall\ncontinue hostilities throughout the\nwinter. We have given up the plan\nof taking Port Arthur by assault ani\nwill compel its capitulation by fam\nine. Its fall would free 50,000 men\nand enable them to reinforce our nor-\nthern army, but we do not need them\njust now."\nThe Captain of Lena Satisfied.\nWashington, Sept. 1C. The an\nnouncement that Captain Berlinsky\ncommanding the Russian transport\nLena at San Francisco had acquies\nced in all the details of the process\nof disarmament prescribed by this\ngovernment and would take advan\ntage of the permission to remain,\nreached the navy department over\nnight in a telegram from Rear Ad\nmiral Goodrich commander in chief\nof the Pacific station.\nRussian Reply as to Contraband.\nSt. Petersburg, Sept. 1C. The Rus\nsian reply to the representations of\nthe United States and Great Britain\nregarding contraband of war was\ncommunicated to their respective em\nbassies this afternoon. It is under\nstood that Russia recognizes the prin\nciple that provisions are not contra\nband when consigned to private par\nties, but only when intended as mil\nitary oi naval stores.\nWounded Men Brought in.\nMukden. Sept. 16. Early this mor\nning twenty-six wounded men be\nlonging to Major General Mistechen\nko\'s Cossack division were brought\nto Mukden. The particulars of the\nskirmish are not available. It is not\nclear whether it was a simple out\npost affair or the beginning of the\nreal Japanese advance on Mukden.\nOn Half Rations at Port Arthur.\nShanghai, Sept. 16. The North\nChina Daily News publishes a priv\nate letter from a Chinese interprete\nemployed from 187 until the end of\nAugust last in the commissariat de\npartment at Port Arthur. The writer\nsays that February last the depart\nment supplied daily 33,00 rations ;o\nthe Russian land forces alone, tlu?\nnaval forces taking care of them\nselves. "But when we departed last\nmonth," he adds, "only 15,000 rations\nwere supplied daily to the whole gar\nrison, including the crews of the ir\nonclads which are now manning the\nforts. There are now 24,000 sick and\nwounded men at Port Arthur. Of am\nmunition of ail kinds there is a very\nsmall stock, and there are only five\nweeks of full rations remaining."\nThe interpreter says the garrison\nof Port Arthur, officers excepted, is\nanxious to surrender.\nChe Foo, Sept. 16. The Japanese\ntroops between September 8 and 10\ncaptured a fort situated on a hill two\nmiles east of Golden Hill by assault.\nThe fighting was not severe. The Ja\npanese were able to retain the fort\nbecause ine quality of powder used\nat Golden Hill was so poor that ma\nny shells fell short and others failed\nto explode. The foregoing informa\ntion was received from an intelligent\nChinaman just arrived. He says the\nJapanese are now tunnelling under\nthe Russian forts with the intention\ncT blowing them up. The work is\nslow and probably will be unsucess\nful. Ammunition is growing scarcer\nin Port Arthur, but there is plenty\nof bread.\nSt. Petersburg, Sept. 16 The As\nsociated Press dispatch from Muk\nden announcing that the Japanese\nare leaving the garrison at Liao\nYang is partially confirmed by a\ndispatch from Kuropatkin. The great\ner part of Oyama\'s army, however,\nis still near Yentai encamped on the\nheights between the mines and the\nrailroad. While the war office does\nnot anticipate an immediate advance\nthe preliminary disposition of the Jap\nanese forces are taken to indicate\nthat the Japanese intend when they\nadvance to strike from the eastward.\nGeneral Sakaroff telegraphs a formal\ndenial of several of , Oyama\'s state\nments. He nays that the alleged\ndum dum bullets found at Liao Yang\nare simply regulation square nosed\nbullets of service revolvers. They\nare lead.- but are not jacketed and\nare in no wise dum dum. The gener\nal also denies the statement that the\nJapanese captured a large quantity\nof ammunition. He says they only ob\ntained possession of a few boxes of\nempty cartridge shells, and says it is\nnot true that the Russian rolling stock\nof the railroad fell into the hands of\nthe Japanese.\nGENERAL\nSTRIKE\nSOCIALISTS IN ITALY MAKE\nTROUBLE FOR GOVERNMENT.\nPRINCE PIEDMONT\nAn Heir to the Throne of Italy Born\nLast Night. King Victor Emman\nuel Grants Benefits in Honor of Xm\nArrival of the Infant Heir.\nRome, Sept. 1C. To protest against\na conflict between strikers and the\npolice in which two strikers were\nkilled, the Socialists have decided on\na general strike throughout Italy,\nwhich began today at Milan and threa\ntens to spread through the whole pe\nninsula. The government has taken\nextraordinary measures to suppress\nthe strike and has stopped all tele\ngrams referring to it.\nRome, Sept. 16. King Victor Em\nmanuel has chosen the title of Prince\nof Piedmont instead of Prince of\nRome for the heir to the throne born\nlast night. This was done to embit\nter the conflict between the church\nand state. To celebrate the birth of\nthe heir, the King has granted am\nnesty to all deserters and also short\nened by six months the terms of im\nprisonment for certain crimes. The\ninfant Prince will be baptized by\nCardinal Richelieu and will be chris\ntened Humbert.\no4\nDAGGER THAT KILLED RIZZIO\nIn Possession of a Man Who Died at\nat Auckland, New Zealand.\nLondon. Sept. 16. Advices from\nWellington, New Zealand, state that\nmuch interest has been aroused there\nby the news that an ancient dagger\nalleged to have been the one with\nwhich Rizzio was fatally stabbed in\nthe presence of Mary Queen of Scots,\nis at present in the possession of the\npublic trustee of that city. The wea\npon came into this official\'s posses\nsion through a man named Donald\nStewart dying intestate at Auckland\nlast March.\nThe dagger is about 12 inches in\nlength, is broken at the point, and\nis inscribed: "Tae H. S. L. D., Frae\nM. S. Q. S.. 1565." This inscription\nis interpreted. to read as follows: "To\nHenrv Stuart.

ROBERT JAMES RUSSELL\nEminent Writer Here to Describe the\nSocial Condition of Women\nof New Mexico.\nRoswell has received more maga\nzine and newspaper advertising than\nany city or town in the United States\nof the same population. The natural\nscenery ha been dwelt on. Writers\nhave raved about the alfalfa fields.\nfruits, stock ranches, farms, and now\ncomes one of the most eminent mag\nazine writers in the United States io\nwrite up the social features and tn?\ncondition of women in the Pecos Val\nley and Roswell.\nThe writer is Mrs. Robert James\nRussell of Chicago. She was sent\nhere by the Santa Fe system prima\nrily to write for "The Earth." a rail\nroad publication of Chicago, which\nis edited by Captain Steele. Mrs.\nRussell desires to meet the intelli\ngent society ladies of Roswell and\nvicinity and to get a true story of\nthe social conditions and the condi\ntions generally of the women of the\nPecos Valley.\nIt has been suggested that the\nWoman\'s Club arrange for a special\nmeeting of the club to receive this\nenterprising woman and give her all\npossible aid in her undertaking, that\nwill mean much to the Pecos Valley.\nShe will also describe the homes and\nsurroundings. The Impression pre\nvails in the east that women in New\nMexico have all the hardships they\nwere forced to bear forty or even\ntwenty years ago. On this account\nmany men who are desirous of mov\ning west refrain from doing so. and\nthe women are not anxious to come\nto a country where there Is is no\nlove of home and no society. Mrs.\nRussell is already charmed with Ros\nwell and several of the society la\ndies she has met. In the first article\nshe will explode the false Impression\nabout New Mexico society, and the\npaper will be circulated In thousands\nof eastern homes. She will al.so\nwrite for the Housekeeper at Minne\napolis, and Men and Women, publish\ned at Cincinnati. She will probably\nwrite a story for the Sunday maga\nzine section of the Chicago Chronicle.\nMrs. Russell is registered at the\nShelby hotel and It is hep Intentlju\nto leave Sunday afternoon for Carls-\nbad.\no\nThe Trials of a Postmaster.\nNext to the editor, the Hst master\nis supposed to be universally Inform\ned and to have notMng else in life\nto do but keep this information on\ntap to all who wish to draw from\nhim.

For exam\nple it Is contrary to postal law for a\npostmaster to answer the question\nwhether John Doe or Richard Roe\nis receiving mail at his office. But\nhere today Postmaster Kellahin has\nhad the inquiry thrown at him as to\nwhether "anyone is receiving mail\nthrough the Roswell iostofnce." The\nepistle certainly deserves a place\namong the freak letters and is given\nherewith minus the signature.\n"Ft. Worth. Tex.. Sept. 12. li"4.\n\'Postmaster. Roswell. N.
