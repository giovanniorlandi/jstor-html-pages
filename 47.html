Dogherty was brought to\nJackson for safe keeping on last\nSaturday, due to the feeling whi-v\nwas running high against him\nBrookhaven. by Sheriff R. C. Ap\nplewhite. On arriving at Jackson\nfriends of Father Dogherty m^d\nond for him in the sum of $5 nr\nThis done, it fs understood, some\nof the relatives of the priest asked\nthat he be tried by a sanity jury.\nHe was committed to the insane\nhospital where he still was at a late\nhour last night, though he was free\nto go where he pleased.\nIn a letter from Supt C. D.\nMitchell, M. D., of the Insane Hos\npital, to Sheriff Applewhite, under\ndate of September 6, it was stated\nthat it would be unfair to make the\naccused go to court. The letter fol\nlows in part:\nIn accordance with our agree\nment of Saturday, the mental con\ndition of Rev. George. A. Dogherty\nof Brookhaven was considered this\nmorning by a full staff of physi\ncains and it was the consensus of\nopinion that if the facts as related\nby the negro boy were true, that in\nview of the present mental condition\nof the patient, he was irresponsible\nat the time and I feel it would be\nunfair to him if he were compelled\nto go before the court at this time.\nnc snows considerable deteriora\ntion in the emotional field and also\nthe field of memory shows a\nmarked tremor of muscular efforts\n' Rnd with his admission that he may\nI hnv<* indulged in alcoholic beverages\ni previously, we feel that the incipient\nI mental disease may be an indication\n| of beginning senility. If, however\nhe shows any evidence of improve\nment to the point where he could\nprobably be indicted, I will notifv\nyou at once, unless you wish the\ncase disposed of in some other way.”\nRev. Dogherty was on Wednesday\nindicted by the grand jury of Lin\ncoln county on the charge preferred\nagainst him, and it was on presen\ntation of a capias to the local sher\niff's office that the man was re\narrested and placed under bond of\n$2,BOO more than he was originally\nheld under.\nThe district attorney and circuit\njudge of that county want the trial\nof the priest as soon as possible, ac\ncording to Sheriff Applewhite.\nFollowing is in part what the\nSemi-Weekly Ledger, a Bsookhaven\nnewspaper had to say about the\naffair:\n‘‘Shaken from center to circum\nference,” only mildly expresses the\nsurprise and1 shock experienced last\nSaturday by our population in the\narrest of Rev. Father Geo. A. Dogh\nerty, pastor of St. Francis church\nat this place on a charge of “a crime\nthe priest’s home just after midnight\nagainst nature” which was made at\nin which a policeman, three young\nmen of the city, another young man\nfrom Missouri, a new-comer to this\ncity, and a young negro boy and the\npriest were all concerned.\n‘‘The affidavit and arrest came\nlast Saturday following an investi\ngation by officers of the reports as\nthey gradually gained momentum,\nand emanating from those who said\nthey had witnessed the alleged\nscenes of the priest's home in\nthe early morning hour and were\ncarried from tongue to tongue until\nappeal was made to the law.\n“Day Policeman and Sanitary In\nspector J. Alec Brister made the af\nfidavit which caused Rev. Dogh\nerty's arrest, the gists of the affidavit\nbeing that “on information and be\nlief the Rev. Father Geo. A. Dogh\nerty did then and there feloniously\nand wilfully commit the detestable\nand abominable crime against na*\nture with mankind, to-wit:- With a\nnegro boy name Brooks.”\n“The affidavit was sworn to and\nmade before Mayor T. M. Smylie, al\nso an ex-offico Justice of the Peace\nwho participated in the investiga\ntion of the affair before he accept\ned the affidavit of the City Police\nmen, which also included an ex\npoliceman, the sheriff, and one or\ntwo of the parties who Reported\nthey had witnessed the alleged in\ncriminating and accusing revelation\nof the very early morning hour.”\n“The negro boy mentioned in the\naffidavit, was arrested and is >\nheld in the county jail under special\nguard day and night, it being stated\nthat he has made a confession of th\ncriminal association with the priest\nalleged in the affidavit. Rev. Dogh\nerty, shortly after his arrest by\nPoliceman Alec Brister and Sheriff\nR. C. Applewhite was taken in a\ncar to Jackson to await further de\nvelopments in the case.”\nFACING GRAVE CRISIS\nIN STATE’S HISTORY\nWhitfield Calls Upon Good*\nPeople to Aid in Solution.\nJackson, Miss., Sept. 6.—Hon.\nHenry L.

I will\nneed the support of all good men and\nwomen in the solution of all the com\nplex problems that confront us.\nIt will be my earnest desire to be\ngovernor of all the people. I have but\nthe kindest feelings for those who\npreferred my distinguished opponents\nfor this office. They certainly had\na right to vote for the man they\nthought best prepared for the posi\ntion.\nIt is my purpose to stand foi every\nthing that is constructive, economical\nand decent for the state, and I call\non all good men and women to forget\nthe differences, bickerings, and divi\nsions of the past and to join with r\nin an effort to make Mississippi a\nprosperous and happy state.\nI shall go into office unpledged and\nI will be in a position at all times to\ndecide for what I believe is best for\nthe state.\nAgain thanking the people of the\nstate for this opportunity for service,\nI am,\nMost sincerely,\nHENRY I* WHITFIELD\nBLACKMAIL ALLEGED\nIre A.

Other varities of fruit can\nbe bought at very low prices. If\nyou want to put out a home or a com\nmercial orchard see the county agent\nfor further particulars.\n—R. H.

Federal, state, county and municipal taxes paid by Class 1\nrailroads for 1922 amounted to $300,620,368, an increase of nearly 206 per cent over\ntheir 1911 taxes, which were $98,626,848.\nThe rate at which taxes have increased in recent years exceeds the rate of\nincrease in any other item of the cost of providing railway service. If freight\nand passenger rates had increased on the same scale as taxes from 1911 to 1922,\nthe average passenger fare in 1922 would have been about 6 cents a mile and the*\naverage charge for carrying one ton of freight one mile in 1922 would have been\nabout 2 V4 cents. .Instead, the average passenger fare in 1922 was 3.028 cents a\nmile, an increase since 1922 of only 64 per cent, and the average charge for carry\ning one ton of freight one mile in 1922 was 1.176 cents, an increase since 1911 of\nonly 68 per cent.\nIn the analysis of the Illinois Central System dollar for 1922, recently pub\nlished, it was shown that 6.89 cents of every dollar received were required to pay\nthe system\'s taxes last year, as compared with only 4.44 cents devoted to dividends.\nThe various governments collecting taxes—federal, state, county and municipal—re\nceived about 66 per cent more revenue from the operations of the Illinois Central\nSystem in 1922 than its owners did.\nComparatively few of our citizens openly favor government ownership of the\nrailroads. However, many of them are advocating a substantial reductionin freight\nand passenger rates. Somr~t*«._£ifousing the cause of restoring the right of the\nforty-enght states to make rates in conflict with interstate rates. Others favor con\nfiscating railway property by scaling down values unreasonably. Those who seek\nthus to hamper the railroads are simply-playing into the hands of the advocates of\ngovernment ownership. Making it more and more difficult for the railroads to exist\nunder private ownership is recognized as the only method through which government\nv ownership of the railroads is likely to be brought about.\nThe federal government does not tax its own property. The states do not\ntax the property of the federal government. They could not do so in the case of\ngovernment-owned railroads, just as they cannot tax the property of government\nowned postoffices or forts or arsenals. If the railroads should become the property\nof the federal government, there would be destroyed a source of tax revenue which in\n1922 amounted to more than $300,000,000. From what source would the federal\ngovernment, states, counties and municipalties make up this lost revenue?\nIt is not reasonable to expect that lower railway rates would compensate the\npeople for their governments’ loss of tax revenue. In the light of our own ex\nperience during federal control and the experience which foreign countries have had,\nthere is every reason to believe that government ownership of the railroads would\nresult in large deficits, which would also have to be made up by increased taxation.\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that the effect of government ownership would be\nhigher freight and passenger rates, poorer service and increased taxation.\nConstructive criticism and suggestions are invited.\nC.
