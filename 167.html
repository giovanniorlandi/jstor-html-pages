Last fall we sent trusty\nmen to this country to stake ^soipe\nclaims for ub.

Our,\nproperty ils largely tundra claims and\n•we thought -we had a perfect machine\nfor working it, but It did not prove a\nsuccess and so our engineer returned\nto Indianapolis to try It again. With\nthese 116 claims It is not likely that I\n•would be looking for other business.\nIt was simply a coincidence that -when\nI left Seattle it was\'oh tbe same boat\nas Judge Noyes and party. Although\nI have known ihim for a long time, yet\n•we weretlhro\'wn together but seldtom\n,on the boat. ,We certainly never bad\nany talk about receiverships. When\nthe Chtpps case came up in court I\nknew nothing about it except that\nsome man had contested Lindeberg\'s\nright to locate iand bold a claim. One\nday just after tbe receivership bad\nbeen, asked tor, I met Judge Noyes.\nIn talking about the matter be re\xad\nmarked:\n:i "I don\'t know what to do about the\nmatter. I want a mati who bias abil\xad\nity, has a will of his own, has money\nenough or Influence enough to put up\na \'bond same one on whom I can rely\nto do this buslneisB in a proper man\xad\nner."\nThat was all he said at the time.\nEither the next day or that same day,\nthe judge sent for me and asked md\nto acft as receiver. I demurred. My\nother interests were occupying my at\xad\ntention at the time and I was as busy\nas I cared to be. But the judge was\n\'firm and forced me to take it.

He poses as a purifier\nof .Nome. He had best begin with\nhimself and Ms partners.\nTO MAKE SOLID WITH NOYES.\nThe day. the Senator arrived at\nNome with Judge Noyes and party on\nboard, this man, acting for. certain at\xad\ntorneys who represent a large mining\ncompany operating near Nome, char\xad\ntered a gasoline launch, paying $100,\nfor the surf was running high and\nsome danger was attendant. On\nreaching the Senator the mnn at once\nlooked up .Judge Noyes, introduced\nhimself, stated that he represented the\nlawyers of Nome, that fine quarters\nwere ready for him and his party, and\nthat all could go ashore at once. Dis\xad\ntrict Attorney Woods was also asked\nto go. But the water was too rough\nand all declined the invitation. Later\nin the dajr, Woods and O. H. Wheeler,\nthe judge\'s private secretary, went\nashore on a tug. They looked up\nsome quarters and hacl about made ar\xad\nrangements when this same man dis\ntcovered them and at once took Woods\n\\and Wheeiler around to the St Law\xad\nrence to show them the rooms that\nhad been reserved for Judge Noyes and\nparty. This was at the tame the only\nfirst-class hotel in Uhe City. Woods\nand Wheeler did not make a decision\nat the time, but went away leaving the\nmatter unsettled. In the meantime\nthe man in question had been telling\neveryone-that Judge Jtfoyes and party\nwpuld be at the St Lawrence. In a\ncouple of dayfe the wind and surf were\nsuch that .Judge Noy es could go ashora\nHe was met at the beach by his new\negad anxious friend and another man,\nwlho was introduced as, "judge." They\nwent at once to the St. Lawrence.\nJudge Noyes was very much pleased\nwith the rooms, and asked the land\xad\nlady what the rent was. She informed\nhim that title rent had been paid.\nNioyes did not take the rooms, but in\xad\nstead went to the Golden Gate hotel,\nwhich was just about completed, but\nstill littered up with dirt, shavings and\nboards, without stoves or carpets. But\nit was, not paid for.\nThe whole scheme was part of an at\xad\ntempt to win Judge Noyes\' favor. Ail\nNome was talking and laughing at the\n\'gang\'s" attempt and failure to "jolly\nthe new judge." Lawyers and busi\xad\nness men were very much pleased at\nwhat they# considered a good sign for\nthe future. Nome had for two or\nthree, years been bled and robbed by a\nset of (theiving officials who would do\nanything for money. With Judge\nNoyes\' arrival a new era commenced.\nBut the "gang" was not disheart\xad\nened They probably reasoned that\nthe new judge wanted to "see the color\nof their money:" So they stooped to\nthe lowest of means and sent several\nanonymous letters to the judge and to\nseveral of his officials. No attentiofa\nwas paid \'to the\' first one or two, but\nwhen one arrived whidh named a dis\xad\ntinct sum, I am informed that it was a\nquarter of a million dollars, .the judge\nbegan to think that some attention\nshould be paid to the gentlemen who\nwere :SO .anxious to secure his favor.\nHe accommodated them by placing the\nletters and what information he had,\ntogether with his suspicions, in the\nhands of the United States marshal\nand the district attorney. "What is be\xad\ning done ,or will be done is\'not known,\nbut every decent and honest lawyer in\nNome hopes that the "gang" with their\nreprehensible methods, will be hauled\nup shortly and summarily dealt with.\nPOLITICS IN IT.\nIt is the general concensus of opin\xad\nion in\'Nome that the effort to stir up a\nbad name for Judge Noyes has back of\nit a certain political deal. C. D. Lane,\none of the men most largely interested\nin claims for which Alexander Mc\xad\nKenzle is receiver, is a prominent dem\xad\nocrat and has contribute^ to the na\xad\ntional campaign fund. The decision\ncl Judge Johnson at Sitka last winter,\nwhich gave Lane his claims, they hav\xad\ning been purchased from the Lapland\xad\ners, who as aliens had no right to lo\ncafce claims, Is Invplved in the present\ncontroversy.\' »Johnson is a vigorous\ndemocrat, having been appointed by\nCleveland. He is now attorney for\nthe Pioneer Mining company, com\xad\nposed Of Lindeberg, Lindblom, Bryn\nston, et al., who as aliens, located min\xad\ning ground in the Nome country. Ap\xad\nparently a jaystewatic course has been\nplanned by these men to make" the\nmiuttqr assume a political hue.

The\nnews oame as a complete surprise to\nthe McKenzle people, Robert Ohipps\nand his attorneys. On the other hand,\nthe "Discovery" people, i. e., Linde\xad\nberg, Lindiblom, Brynston and their\nattorneys, declare that they fully ex\xad\npected it and are not slow to expre33\nthemselves. Neither Judge Noyes nor\nany of the court officials have any\xad\nthing to say in regard to the order.\nAlexander MoKenxie smiled and re\xad\nmarked that he was glad to get rid r.f\nthe business anyway.\nIt will be a week or ten days before\nthe order can be fully carried out and\n•the claim involved, which is Discovery\non Anvil, turned over to the defend\xad\nants. The receiver must make a re\xad\nturn, to \'the court of all the wort per\xad\nformed. When the full report is\nmade public some people will be great\xad\nly surprised. While McKen?ie him\xad\nself is questioned, no one questions his\nmethods of working this claim. He\n\'has now been in charge of the work for\nabout a month. During the time he\nreduced the price of wages from $3.50\na day to $2.05 a day, teams from $25\na day to $15. A number of improve\xad\nments have been made in the shape of\nnew houses, store rooms, a tool house\nand several new lines of sluice boxes\nThe claim has produced -more dust\nwith less expense and less men at work\nthan at any time previous. The total\namount of the- month\'s clean-up will\nbe close to $200,000. Jafet Lindeberg\nsays that the best monthly clean-up\nwhile he was running the claim was a\nlittle over $100,000. All the dust\ncleaned up during McKenzie\'s reign\nwas deposited in one of the local safe\ndeposit vaults and could not be touched\nexcept by order of the court This\namount of money will now be turned\nover to the "Discovery" crowd and\nwill so.pn find its way down to Seattle\nwhere they have a big bank account."\nThe immediate effect of the circuit\njudge\'s order will be the vacation of\nall the receiverships. McKenzie holds\ndown five. Two of the claims are\nowned by Lindeberg et al., and the\nother three by C. D. Lane, although\nthe claims stan^ in names of other\npeople. These Lane claims were orig\xad\ninally staked by the Laplanders who\ncame down here from Sheldon Jack\nson\'s reindeer station. Lane bought\nthem from the Laps.\nMany claims will be completely tied\nup for the rest of the fall, as tne con\xad\ntesting parties will seek injunctions to\nrestrain the holders from working the\nproperties, stiripphig and "skinning"\nthem of their value and rendering them\nworthless to the claimants. This be\xad\ning the case, it is evidently not to the\nadvantage of the camp that the receiv\xad\ners will be discharged, tor they have\nworked tie property, and given em\xad\nployment to several hundred men.\nThere are some thirty other claims\nbeing run by receivers, all of whom\nwill \'be discharged if the request is\nmade by the defendants. In several\ncases tlhis will not be the case as the\nreceiver is working to the satisfaction\nof both parties.\nDA?

S. Forestry Division has\nbeen almost purely a bureau of infor\xad\nmation. But with an enlarged and\nmuch needed appropriation of money\ntnis branch of public service within\nthe last eighteen months, has become\nan active participant in practical for\xad\nest conservation and development\nthroughout the United States. At the\npresent time all the work of the divi\xad\nsion is assigned to four sections with\na man at the head of each possessed of\nspecial knowledge and qualifications.\nThe sections are as follows: Working\nplans, economic tree planting, special\ninvestigations, office work. The prin\xad\ncipal scenes of its activities of late is\nin the woods, covering In its operation\ndomestic and native trees and forests.\nJ. W. Tourney is the superintendent of\ntree planting, who has two assistants\nGeorge L. Clothier and W. L. Hall.\nTbe. laititer\'s field of operation is con\nfined to states in the southwest, and\nthe former is in charge oi the work in\nNebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, North Da\xad\nkota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and\nMichigan.\nThe working plan has for its aim\nan enlargement of an interest in prac\xad\ntical forestry among farmers, horticul\nturaiists, lumbermen, etc. And to ac*\ncomplish this desirable end, at the\npresent time, Mr. Tourney has his two\nassistants operating in the west, fur\xad\nnishing proper drafted- plans, giving\nadvice and rendering needful aid as\ncircumstances may allow. Being\nscientific and practical foresters, they\naire enabled to render much assistance\nwhich proves most advantageous to\nthose engaged or desiring to engage\nin tree culture.\nMr Clothier has been in our state\nfor some time in the performance of\nhis duties. He has been connected\nwith the agricultural college of the\nstate of Kansas for near twenty-one\nyears, holding the chair of botany tor\na series of years. He if fully fitted,\nscientifically and practically, for \'the\nwork, and his magnetic enthusiasm and\nsensible ideas awaken the trusting con\xad\nfidence of all who would make forestry\nin any of its phases a study in actual\napplication. The writer has been as\xad\nsisting and co-operating with Mr.\nClothier in Ms work in North Dakota.\nThis Official, Mr. Clothier, finds the\nfullest gratification and encourage\xad\nment in the abiding interest mani\xad\nfested by the people of our state in the\ngeneral subject of forestry, particular\xad\nly in the matter of. successful tree cul\xad\nture. Upon due investigation he has\nreached the conclusion that the trees\nof North Dakota, cultivated and native,\nin point of hardiness, enduring habits\nand growths, will compare favorably\nwith similar trees grown in any other\nwestern state.-\nThis week Mr. Clothier and myself\nexamined the woods of the Turtle\nMountains,. At Pish Lake and con\xad\ntiguous sections, we found most at\xad\ntractive and extensive forests—where\nthe trees, sound and healthy, grow in\ncompact bodies from 40 to 00 or more\nfeet high. I there ^observed the fol\xad\nlowing trees: white aspen, having\nsmall leaves Mack aspen, having\nlarge leaves balm of gilead, paper\ncanoe or white birch, white elm, bur\noak, black diamond and sandbar wil\xad\nlows, white ash, black \'haw, boxelder,\nchokechenry, pinehenry, plum, also the\njuneberry, high bush cranberry dog\xad\nwood, thorn bush and the hazel bush.\nTie aspen and i&e balm of gilead were\nthe principal trees, with diameters\nvarying from ten to fifteen and in some\ninstances twenty-four inches in diam\xad\neter, attaining a height of from 50 to\n«5 or more feet!?!?\'\nhito*\n1.\n•i\nv»\n&L\nIt was appallitog notice whs»t\nextent the fires hftve destroyed the tim\xad\nber of the Turtle Mountains—thous\xad\nands of \'aarqfc of compact valuable\nwoods utterly burned and consumed,\ncausing ten ttanep more destruction in\none yaair lias been wrougtjfjt by the\n4\nterritorial dsys o£ our staie. This is\nMz\nf*F3F\n1900. FIVE CENTS\na question that is deserving, as\nthrough the columns of the Tribune I\nhave often claimed, of the most serious\nconsideration of our legislators, as\nproper fire protection at the moun\xad\ntains will save the valuable timber\nproperty belonging to our state, located.\nfor tiie benefit of our state institutions\nand to private holders and homestead\nsettlers. The woods at present stand\xad\ning on those uplands are now far more\nexposed and surer of destruction by.\nthe annual fires than at any previous\ntime because the extensive adjoining\nlands are thickly covered with a large\namount of fire burnt trees and litter\nmaking most favorable conditions tor\nfresh devouring fires.\nThe lakes, all fregh bodies of water,\nI found admirably adapted to fish-cul\nture. They are numerous and of good\nsize and deep. They are scattered all\nlorough the mountains. One near\nthe west end of the woods, Lake Meta\ngoshe, has a shore line of twenty-two\nmiles. It contains many nsh. Willow\nLake is twelve miles in circumference.\nOne of the largest on the east end of\nthe mountains is known as Pish lake.\nIt is surrounded by high hills covered\nwiitih. an unbroken forest. It is near\nfour miles »ong and from half to three\nquarters of a mile wide with a good\ndepth of water. Large pickerel are\ntaken from these waters one caught\nthere a few years ago weighed thirty\npounds. In that lake in 1899 I planted\nblack bass. During that time they\nhave grown from one inch to five or\nsix inches in length and their spawn\xad\ning will add largely to the finny tribes\nin tihose \'beautiful crystal waters.\n\'I will make the U.

BRYAN\'S TRIP.\nMr. Bryan, the democratic candidate\nfor president, made a .flying trip\nthrough the state Saturday.. Mr. Bryan\nwas greeted by crowds who came to\nsee \'him largely out of curiosity and he\nreceived la cordial greeting and a re\xad\nspectful hearing. Ifcis to be regretted\nhe did not have something better to\noffer them than the illogical and emp\xad\nty. appeal to prejudice of which he de\xad\nlivered himself.\nA sampler of Mr. Bryan\'s consistency\nwiH serve. Fcrur years ago Mr. Bryan\nstated openly in a speech that the\nmoney question was paramount in this\ncountry and would be until it was set\xad\ntled in favor of firee silver.\nIn his Far-go speech he evaded the\nmoney question by storting Hhat it Was\nnot the pairiamount issue—-tfiat the\nmatter of human rights overshadowed\nit.\nNow why has Mr. Bryan dropped\nthe money question into ta secondary\nplace in this oamipedgn? For the simple\nreason thiat every prediotlon and pro\xad\nphesy he made four years ago bas been\nproven absolutely false and worthless.\nHe has no ground to stand upon. He\nproplhested misery, want and poverty\nwith the gold standard. W« have had\nabundance, prosperity and increased\nbusiness..\nThis is the reason Mr. Bryan has\ndropped the money question. Not be\ncause of the paramount issue of hu\xad\nman rights^--iKi«t\'\nbebaAise\nhis heart\nthrobs mare for the Filipino and for\nAguinnldo than for the silver dollar,\nbut for the one reason that his fioweiy\nperorations of four years ago with re\xad\ngard to the money question have been\nknocked into a cocked hat.\nMr. Bryan\'s address, as it is re\xad\nported, consisted of the following:\nA diatribe against Englana and Eng-\nlish methods, the bugaboo which was\nworked threadbare in the campaign\nfour years ago.\nA roast 9f Mark Hanna and a resur\xad\nrection of the Wall street scarecrow.\nA swipe ait the ice trust, controlled.\nby Mir. Bryan\'s apostles, Croker and\nVan Wyck.\nThe claim that the Philippine islands\ncould be protected by tlbie Monroe doc\xad\ntrine with a government by Aguinaldo\nand ihiis confederates.\nAn offset |or the democratic ^Lisfmn\nchisement of negjroes/in the south By\nan alleged injustice done the natives\nof the island of Sulu.\nAnd finally the militarism scarecrow\n—the vast army of 1CK»000 men that is\nto drill and remain in idleness aiid be\xad\ncome a threat to the safety of the 75,\n0X),000 people in tMa land of ours—\nwhich would be a force of\nBix\nsoldiers\nto Burleigh county and the same pro\xad\nposition thrwiglh the country.\nThere was nothing about the tariff\nfawue—that which was paramount with\nMr. Bryan when \'he was in congress.\nHe has been completely silenced on the\ntariff and mftney questkmfe. He was\na fiojtee prophet on both of them.. He\n-mill prove a fotoe prophet on his\nteumped-up ixu&piiaiiim and ipilitar\nimn Uanies.

Will Mr. Bryan admit that\nhis policy four years agb was a dollar\nmark policy? Will he admit that\nfour years ago he could not see human\nrights if thejr stood behind a dollar?\nWas Mr. Bryan unable to see anything\nbut a dollar four years ago? What\nhals knocked the scales from his eyes\nso that this year he can see everything\nbut the money\'question?\nOF UNTOLD VALUE.\nThe Information Contained in this\nGentlemen\'s Statement is Price-\'\nless.\nThe hale, the hearty, the strong can\nafford to toss this paper to one side\nimpatiently when they read the fol\xad\nlowing, but any suffering in this lo\xad\ncality who has spent & mint of money\nand suffered hours of excruciating tor\xad\nture caused by kidney complaint will\nstand in his own light if he does not\nfollow the valuable advice offered by:\nMr. W.

As\ntime ran on. says F. S. Hammonds In\nFarm and Ranch, they improved by\nInclosing large tracts of land. Within\nthese inclosures th? old long horned,\nlong shanked racer could roam at will,\nalmost entirely without restraint. But\nTexas cattlemen began to see that the\nbetter bred stock sf the northern states\ncommanded far better prices on the\nmarket. As a result, better blood was\nIntroduced, In consequence of which\nthe time is fast coming when a pair of\nlbng honls wfll drsLW a prize, but as a\ncuriosity.\nBut let us not stop here. Texas ranch\ncattle, as a rule, are yet Inferior to\nthose of the northern states owing to\nthe lack of attention, feeding, etc. Some\nthink, to start a ranch,\'\'anything will\ndo, Intending, of course, to grade up\nand allowing them to shift for them*\nselves, losing sight of the fact that to\nstart\'with a good grade is a great sav\xad\ning and that feed and good care gen\xad\nerally are the principal essentials that\nhave brought the beef herds to such a\nhigh standard of excellence.\nThe old Idea that cattle in Texas\nneed no feed, or, rather, that it does\nnot pay to feed them, happily is fast\nbeing dispelled.\nBut successful ranching condensed\nthis: Stock up with a fair to good\ngrade. Feed should be provided in suf\xad\nficient quantity to keep all stock tn\niealthful growing condition.\nTo Illustrate. If the northern farmer\ncan successfully handle stock where\nbe must feed from five to six months\nof the year, how much more so can we\nhere in Texas, where we are compelled\nto feed only one or two months in a\nyear.\nUpon a western ranch In 1898 the\nmanager lost poor cows and young\ncalves by the score, while his neighbor\nranchers, who raised two and three\ntons of feed to the acre, had scarcely\nany loss at all. The successful man in\nthe north, where the winters are long\nand severe, never has poor stock. The\ncareful rancher, though he may have a\nherd of several hundred, where he can\nraise feed, can. by looking after the\nweaker ones, keep them in good condi\xad\ntion. Then by salting frequently and\ncirculating among them he can keep\nthem tame and thus secure the best de\nteiopmqnt.\nV,-..Feedlog\nHogl.\nFanners who raise a few hogs to sell\naround home should beep the pig ready\nfor market until tbe market is ready\ntor the pig. Kept in good condition on\ngreen pasture supplemented with a lit\xad\ntle corn every day, th» cost of feeding\ntor a Jew weeks longer Is very slight\ntrjr to so arrange matters as not to be\ncompelled to sell anything until every.\nis favorable. There Is profit 1j\nli-fton* Fhna1 aad Bunch.\nSWINE BREEDING.\nThe\nKind That BMUri the.\nThe markets today are paying more\nfor the fat backs, the corn fed hog,\nthan for any other class. If we want\nto make any improvement in the qual\xad\nity of our hogs for producing bacon, it\ncan be done by selecting the larger,\nmore rangy sows for breeders, then ^y\na system of feeding the byproducts of\nthe dairy and mill, with good pasture\nand less corn, we can practically ac\xad\ncomplish the result, but not until the\npackers of this country make a higher\nprice for hogs fed with a view to mak\xad\ning a finer quality of bacon. The early\nmaturing type of hogs will pay the\nbest, especially in the corn belt. Most\nof our breeders and many of onr best\nfarmers are changing their methods of\nfeeding from an all corn ration from\nplghood to maturity to one of greater\nvariety. It is conceded by all up to\ndate farmers and breeders that the hog\nis a grazing animal. Nothing so helps\nto cheapen the production of our pork\nproducts as grass or the clovers. I\nspoke of there beigg more profit in /the\nearly maturing type of hogs than the\nso called bacon sorts. By the early\nmaturing type I mean the improved\nhog of tbday of whatever breed one\nfancies. It is a hog that by many years\nof careful selection, breeding and feed\xad\ning can be put on the market at an ex\xad\ntremely early age and at a weight that\nIs today a popular weight. A bog of\nthis kind can be grown at much more\nprofit than one that takes 12 to 18\nmonths to get ready for market, as it is\na well known fact that the first hun\xad\ndred pounds costs less than the second\nhundred. The risk is also much less in\ngrowing a hog that can be turned off at\n6 or months of age than in carrying\nthem along through the winter and\nmaking a heavier weight.\n-When Colt* Should Be Weaned.\nFarmers differ greatly as to the age\ncolts should be when weaned and as to\ntheir treatment before and after wean\xad\ning time, says a correspondent of The\nPrairie Farmer. I wean my colts when\nthey are about 6 months old, never\nyounger than 6 months, and sometimes\nearly colts suck until 7 months old, for\nI like to wean them all at the same\ntime if possible, as it is less bother. 1\nprefer to have my colts come about the\n1st of April. Then they will be about\nthe right age to wean in the fall when\nyou want to take the mares out of pas\xad\nture. Put tbe mares in tbe barn and\nlet the colts have the run of the pas\xad\nture, with open shed to run under and\nplenty of feed, and they will do very\nwell until cold weather. Then they\nBhould be stabled at night and during\nstormy weather in tbe daytime.\nknow some farmers who let their colts\nrun in the stalk field all winter without\nany grain. They come out in the\nspring very poor and not as large as\nthey were when weaned six months be\xad\nfore. There positively cannot be any\nmoney in colts managed in that way. A\ndraft colt that is properly bred and\ncared for until It is 12\n^spf\nJfos«\ntit BUurlcet. \'-#Y\nIn a paper read before the Wisconsin\nFarm4rsV institute A. J. Lovejoy said\nthat the utility of the hog is In a great\nmeasure owing to its remarkable fe\xad\ncundity, reproducing at a year old and\nbearing from five to ten at a time and\noften more. Some man of figures hat\nestimated the product of a single sow\nwith only six young at a time in te$\ngenerations to amount to the grand to\xad\ntal of 6,500,000. The hog has been |i\nreliable source of revenue on the Amer\xad\nican farm since the earliest recollection\nof man, when the farmer raised but a\nfew to use up the refuse of the kitchen\nand dairy and to supply the family\nwith good old fashioned pork and sau\xad\nsage, up to the present day, when bis\nlordship, the up to date hog, supplies\nin his various products the wants of\nthe people of the civilized world not\nonly with choice bacon and hams, but\nwith lard, illuminating and lubricating\noils, head cheese, sausage, combs,\nbrushes, buttons, etc. What kind of\nhog is most In demand? What shall\nwe as farmers breed to receive the\nmost profit from in the shortest possi\xad\nble time? There has been of late a\ngreat hue and cry about the "bacon\nhog," and there are many who think\nwe should return to the type of 30 or\n40 years ago, thus losing all the im\xad\nprovement made in the feeding quali\xad\nties of our modern hog.\nmonthB\nold\nshould weigh about 1,000 pounds, and\nif you do not obtain very nearly that\nweight without too much fat you have\nmisused it either in breeding or feed\xad\ning. I would not wean a colt until I\nhad taught it to eat oats and had it\neating enough so it would not material\xad\nly miss its mother\'s milk when weaned.\n*.\nSavins Horaei.\nSaving horseflesh Is not a conspicu\'\nous object in farm management We\nare apt to be too careless in this re\xad\ngard, sometimes working our teams too\nhard, driving them too hard and by\noverloading them and now and then\nruining an animal by overstraining. A\ncountry doctor was once remonstrated\nwith for buying such light buggies. He\nwore out a good many. His reply to\nthe remonstrance was that buggies\nwere cheaper than good horses and\nthat he could drive a horse three times\nlonger to a light vehicle than he could\nto a heavy one. The cost of road build\xad\ning Is sometimes too great to be consid\xad\nered at all. There is no doubt of that,\nand farmers who live in sections where\nit is exceedingly expensive to l?uild\ngood roads are not to blame for oppos\xad\ning their construction. But good roads\nare of such vital importance that the\nsubject ought to be calmly considered\nin its every phase. They will enhance\nthe value of property, will save many\ndollars in the increased active longevi\xad\nty of horses, will add to the price oral!\nstock that It\' carted to market, for it\ncan be earned economically.—VBL.

When\nthe people then assembled at the polls,\nafter a term of democratic legislation and\nAdministration, business was dead, indus\xad\ntry "paralyzed and the national credit dis\xad\nastrously -Impaired. The country\'s capital\nwas hidden and its labor distressed and\nunemployed! .- ...\nThe- democrats had no other plan with\nwhich to Improve the ruinous conditions\nwhich they had themselves produced, than\nto coin sliver at the ratio of 16 to 1. The\nrepublican party, denouncing this plan as\nsufe to produce conditions-even worse than\nthose from which relief was sought, prom\xad\nised to restore prosperity by means of two\nlegislative measures—a protective tariff\nand a Law making -gold the standard of\nvalue. The people by great majorities Is\xad\nsued tp t)»e republican party a commission\nto enact these laws.\nThis comlnlsslon has been executed, apa\nthe republican promise is redeemed. Pros\xad\nperity more general and more abundant\nthan we have ever known has followed\nthese enactments. There Is no longer\ncontroversy as to the value of any govern\xad\nment obligation: Every American dollar\nIs a gold dollar or Its assured equivalent,\nand American credit stands higher than\nthat of any other nation. Capital is fully\nemployed and everywhere labor is pront\nably occupied.\nNo single fact can more strikingly tell\nthe story of what republican government\nmeans to the country than this—that\nwhile during the whole period of 107 years\nfrom-1790 to 1897. there was an excess of\nexports over Imports of only $383,028,497,\nthere has been In the short three years of\nthe present republican administration an\nexcess of exports over Imports In. the enor\xad\nmous sum of $1,483,537,094.\nTHE WAR.\nAnd while the American people, sus\xad\ntained by this republican legislation, have\nbeen achieving these splendid triumphs In\ntheir business and commerce, they have\nconducted and In victory concluded a war\nfor liberty and human rights. No thought\nof national aggrandizement tarnished the\nhigh purpose with which American stand\xad\nards were unfurled. It was a war un\xad\nsought and patiently resisted, but when It\ncame the American government was ready.\nIts fleets were cleared for action. Its\narmies were In the field, and -the quick ana\nsignal triumph of its forces on land and\nsea bore equal tribute to the courage of\nAmerican soldiers &nd sailors, and to tne\nskill and foresight of republican statesman\xad\nship. To ten millions of the human race\nthere was given "a new birth of free\xad\ndom" and to the American people a new\nand noble responsibility.\nWe Indorse the administration of Wll\nliauf McKlnley. Its acts have been estab\xad\nlished in wisdom and In patriotism, and at\nhome and abroad it has distinctly elevated\nand extended the Influence of the Amer\xad\nican nation, Walking untried paths and\nfacing unforseen responsibilities, President\nMcKlnley has been In every situation the\ntrue American patriot and the upright\nstatesman, clear In vision, strong In judg\xad\nment, firm In action, always inspiring and\ndeserving the confidence of his country\xad\nmen.\nDEMOCRATS AS A MENACE.\nIn asking the American people to in\xad\ndorse this republican record and to renew\ntheir commission to the republican party,\nwe remind them of the fact that the men\xad\nace to their prosperity has always resided\nlu democratic principles and no less In the\ngeneral Incapacity of the democratic party\nto conduct public affairs. The prime es\xad\nsential of business prosperity Is public con\xad\nfidence In the good sense of the govern\xad\nment and in its ability to deal intelligently\nwith each new problem of administration\nand legislation. That confidence the dem\xad\nocratic party has never earned. It Is hope-\nTHE GOLD STANDARD.\nlessly Inadequate and the country\'s pros\xad\nperity, when democratic success at the\npolls is announced, halts and ceases in\nmere anticipation of democratic blunders\nand failures.\nWe renew our allegiance to tht principles\nof the gold standard and declare our con\xad\nfidence In the wisdom of the legislation of\nthe fifty-sixth congress by which the\nparity of all our money and the stability\nof our currency on a gold basis has been\nsecured. We recognize that interest rates\nare a potent factor in production and bus\xad\niness activity, and for the purpose of fur\xad\nther equalizing and of further lowering\nthe rates of Interest we favor such mone\xad\ntary legislation as will enable the varying\nneeds of the season and of all sections to\nbe promptly met in order \'that trade may be\nevenly sustained, labor steadily employed\nand commerce enlarged. The volume of\nmoney in circulation was never so great\nper capita as it is today.\nWe declare our steadfast opposition to\nthe free and unlimited coinage of silver.\nNo measure to that end could ber consid\xad\nered without the support of the leading\ncommercial countries of the world. How\xad\never firmly republican legislation may seem\nto have secured the country against the\nperil of base and discredited currency, the\nelection of a democratic president conld\nnot fall to impair the country\'s credit and\nto bring once more into question the inten\xad\ntion of the American people to maintain\nupon the gold standard the parity of their\nmoney\'s circulation.\' The democratic\nparty must be convinced that the American\npeople will never tolerate the Chicago plat\xad\nform..\nTHE TRUST QUESTION.\nWe recognize the necessity and proprie\xad\nty of the honest co-operation of capital to\nmeet new business conditions and espe\xad\ncially to extend our rapidly Increasing for\xad\neign trade, but we -condemn all conspira\xad\ncies and combinations Intended to restrict\nbusiness, to create monopolies, to limit\nproduction or to control prices and favor\nsuch legislation as\' will effectually restrain\nand prevent all such abuses,, protect and\npromote competition and secure the rights\nof producers, laborers and all \'who are en\xad\ngaged In Industry and commerce.\nTHE POLICY OF PROTECTION.\nWe renew our faith in the policy of\nprotection to American labor. In that\npolicy our Industries have been established,\ndiversified and maintained. By protecting\nthe home market the competition has been\nstimulated and production cheapened. Op\xad\nportunity to the Inventive genius of our\npeople has been secured and wages In every\ndepartment of labor maintained at high\nrates, higher now than ever before, always\ndistinguishing our working people in their\nbetter conditions of life from those of any\ncompeting country. Enjoying the blessings\nof American common schools, secure in the\nright of self-government and protected In\nthe occupancy of their own markets, their\nconstantly increasing knowledge and skill\nhave enabled them finally to enter the mar\xad\nkets of the world. We favor the associated\npolicy of reciprocity, so directed as to open\nour markets on favorable\' terms for what\nwe do not ourselves produce in return for\nfree foreign markets.\nIN THE INTERESTS OF LABOR.\nIn the further interest of American\nworkiugmen, we favor a more effective re\xad\nstriction of the immigration Of cheaper\nlabor from foreign lands, the extension of\nopportunities of education for working\nchildren, the raising of the age limit for\nchild labor, the protection of free labor, as\nagainst contract convict labor, and an\neffective system of labor Insurance.\nRESTORATION OF OUR SHIPPING IN\xad\nDUSTRY.\nOur present dependency upon foreign\nshipping for nine-tenths of our foreign car\xad\nrying is a great loss to the industry of this\ncountry. It is a serious danger to otir\ntrade for Its\' sudden withdrawal in the\nevent of European war would seriously\ncripple our expanding foreign commerce!\nThe national defenses and the navql effi\xad\nciency of this country, moreover, supply a\ncompelling reason for legislation which will\nenable us to recover our formir place\nfttfioflg\' the itrtide-carrylng fleet\'s of the\nworld*-•\nTHE PENSION PLANK.\nThe nation owes a debt of profound grat\xad\nitude to the soldiers and sailors who\nliave\nfought Its battles, and it is the govern\xad\nment\'s duty to provide for the survivors\nand for the widows and orphans of those\nwho have fallen In the country\'# wars.\nThe pension laws, founded in this just sen-\n-\'v.\ntiment, should be liberal, and should be\nliberally administered and preference\nshould be given wherever practicable with\nrespect to employment In the public service\nto soldiers and Bailors and to their widows\nand orphans.\nAN EFFICIENT CIVIL SERVICE.\nWe commend the policy of the republican\nparty in maintaining the efficiency of the\ncivil service. The administration. ha$ act\xad\ned wisely In its effort to secure for public\nservice In Cuba, Porto Rico, Hawaii and\nthe Philippine Islands only those whose fit\xad\nness has been determined by training and\nexperience. We believe that employment\nIn the public service In these territories\nshould be confined as far as practicable to\ntheir Inhabitants.\nIt was the plain purpose of the fifteenth\namendment to the constitution to prevent\ndiscrimination on account of race or color\nin regulating the elective \'franchise. De\nVices of state governments, whether stat\xad\nutory or constitutional enactment, to avoid\nthe purpose of this amendment, are revo\xad\nlutionary and should be condemned.\nGOOD ROADS.\nPublic movements looking to a perma\xad\nnent improvement of the roads and high\xad\nways of the country meet with our cordial\napproval and we recommend tikis subject to\nthe earnest consideration .of the people and\nthe legislatures of the several states.\nWe favor the extension of the rural free\ndelivery service wherever Its extension may\nbe justified.\nARID LANDS.\nIn further pursuance of the constant pol\xad\nicy of the republican party to provide free\nhomes on the public domain, we recom\xad\nmend adequate national legislation to re\nclulm the arid lands of the United States,\nreserving control of the distribution of wa\xad\nter for* Irrigation to the respective states\nand territories.\nWe favor home rule\' for and the early\nadmission to statehood of the territories of\nNew Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma.\nA REDUCTION OF WAR TAXES.\nThe Dlngley act amended to provide suf\xad\nficient revenue for the conduct of the war\nhas so well performed its work that it has\nbeen possible to reduce the "war debt in\nthe sum of $40,000,000. So ample are\' the\ngovernment\'s revenues, and so great is the\npublic confidence In the Integrity of its ob\xad\nligations that Its newly funded 2 per cent\nbonds sell at a premium. The country is\nnow justified In expecting and it will be\nthe policy of the republican party to bring\nabout a reduction of the war taxes.\nTRADE EXPANSION.\nWe favor the construction, ownership,\ncontrol and protection of an Isthmian canal\nby the government of the United States.\nNew markets are necessary for the in\xad\ncreasing surplus of our farm products.\nEvery effort should be made to open and\nobtain new markets, especially in the ori\xad\nent, and the administration |s warmly .to\nbe commended for its successful effort to\ncommit all trading and- colonizing nations\nthrough the policy of the open door In\nChina. In interest of our expanding com\xad\nmerce, we recommend that, congress create\na department of commerce and industries\nIn the charge of a secretry with a seat In\nthe cabinet. The consular system should\nbe reorganized under the supervision of\nthis new department upon such a basis of\nappointment and tenure as will render It\nstar more serviceable to the nation\'s In\xad\ncreasing trade.\nThe American government must protect\nthe person and property of every citizen\nwherever they are wrongfully violated or\nplaced In peril.\nWe congratulate the women of America\nupon their splendid record of public service\nIn. the volunteer aid association and the\nnurses In camp and hospital during the re\xad\ncent campaigns of our armies in the east\xad\nern and western Indies, and we appreciate\ntheir faithful co-operation in all works of\neducation and Industry.\nPresident McKlnley has conducted the\nirelgn affairs of the United States with\ndistinguished credit to the American peo\xad\nple. In releasing the United States from\nthe grievous conditions of a .European al\xad\nliance for the government of Samoa his\ncourse is especially to be commended. By\nhis securing to our undivided control the\nmost Important Island of the Samoan group\nand the best harbor In the southern Pacific\nevery American interest has been safe^\nguarded.\nWe approve the annexation of the Ha\xad\nwaiian islands to the United States.\nWe commend the part taken by our gov\xad\nernment in the peace conference at the\nHague. We assert our steadfast adherence\nto the policy announced In the Monroe doc\xad\ntrine.\nThe provisions of the Hague convention\nwere wisely regarded when President Mc\xad\nKlnley tendered his friendly offices in the\ninterest of peace between Great Britain\nand the South African republic. While the\nAmerican government must continue the\npolicy prescribed by Washington, affirmed\nby every succeeding president and imposed\nupon us by the Hague treaty of non-inter\nventlon in European controversies, the\nAmerican people earnestly hope that a way\nmay soon be found, honorably alike to both\ncontending parties, to terminate the strife\nbetween them.\nIn accepting by the treaty of Paris the\nJust responsibility of our victories in the\nSpanish war, the president and the senate\nwon the undoubted approval of the Ameri\xad\ncan people. No other course was possible\nS?an\nJ_4e8troy\nBISMARCK DAILY T1UBUNK: MONDAY, OCT. 1, JUUOp|\nSpain\'s sovereignty\nthroughout the western Indies and In the\nPhilippine Islands.\nThat course created our responsibility\nbefore the world, and with the unorganized\npopulation whom our intervention had\nfreed from Spain, to provide for the maln\ntenance of law and order, and for the es\xad\ntablishment of good government and for\nthe performance of International obliga\xad\ntions. Our authority could not be less than\nour responsibility and wherever sovereign\nrights\'were extended It became the high\n?uty the government to maintain Its au\xad\nthority, to put down armed insurrection\nto confer the blessings of liberty and\nupon all the rescued peoples.\nThe iargest measure of self-goverfiment\nconsistent w,tb their welfare and our du\xad\nties shall be secured to them by law. To\nCuba independence and self-government\nwere assured In the same voice by which\nwar was declared, and to the letter this\npledge shall be performed.\nThe republican party, upon Its history\nand upon this declaration of its principles\nand polldels confidently Invokes the con\xad\nsiderate and approving judgment of the\nAmerican people.\nInventors! u&s\nFEE\nInventors Low Co., Washington, D.

In a time of profound\npeace a democratic administration was\nforced to sell government bonds to pay the\nnecessary and current expenses of the gov\xad\nernment. Under the wise, businesslike\nand patriotic administration, of President\nMcKlnley these conditions have all been\nchanged. All branches of Industry remain\nactive and successful agricultural Interests\nmore prosperous and labor more generally\nand continuously employed and better paid\nthan at any previous time. Monetary\nvalues have been fixed and settled and in\nthe treasury of the United States, Instead\nof a deficit one of the marked features of\na democratic administration, we find a\nrevenue adequate to meet all the demands\nof the government.\nWe favor\' such legislation as will de\xad\nstroy all unlawful\'Combinations of capital\nformed for the purpose of limiting1 produc\xad\ntion or increasing the price of manufactured\nproducts.

Porto Rico and the Philip\xad\npine islands have become possessions of\nthe United States as the Inevitable and\nunavoidable results of that war, and we\ncompliment the North Dakota volunteers\nupon their splendid record in both the\nCuban and Philippine wars.\n1\nWe congratulate the people of the coun\xad\ntry upon the enactment into law of the\ncurrency bill, which provides the gold\nstandard as the monetary unit, of valu\nFinancial discussions/ no longer disturb the\nbusiness conditions of our people and all\nbusiness transactions have been placed on\na basis that Insures protection to capital\nand encouragement to the employment of\nlabor.\nWe are heartily in accord with the policy\nof the national administration toward our\nnewly acquired possessions\nWe favor the present prohibition law\nand a faithful enforcement of the same as\nwell as all other laws- of the sate, especi\xad\nally those In the penal and criminal codes\nand their strict and impartial enforcements\nin all parts of the state at all times.\nUnited States Hap.\nA copy of our haads«asnutp, 48x33\ninches, printed in four colon and\nmounted on a roller, will be sent to\nany address on receipt ol\n15\nSubscribe for the Tribune.\n.: .,A GBE2AT OFFEB.\nBismarck Tribune readers know\nwhat the American Agriculturist Ut—\nthe best farm paper published.
