It was once\nowned by Doctor Schoof, n German.\nLess than a hundred years ago tho en\'\ntiro island was owned by tho ruling\nking, or chief. Indeed, as lato as 1838\nIt was owned by Kaumualll. And ho\nwas the king who transferred tho title\nof tho Hanalel valley to Dr. Schoof.\nIt came about this way:\nIn 1813, just after tho war of tho\nRevolution between the United States\nand Great Britain, tho Governor of tho\nRussian colony at Sitka, Alaska, pur\nchased the Attawelpa, a ship that had\nbeen engaged In tho naval activities,\ntho home harbor of which was Boston.\nPrevious to tho discharge of tho Amer\nican captain and crow tho ship was\nsent by the- Governor on a voyage to\nthe "Sandwich Islands."\nWrecked at Waimea\nHaving sold a goodly portion of her\ncargo on the other Islands, sho visited\nKauai for the purpose of trading with\nthe natives. A storm came up, and\nthe vessel was driven ashore and\nwrecked at Waimea. Most of tho car\ngo on board was saved, and this was\ntaken ashore and committed to the\ncare of Kaumualll, then tho reigning\nchief of Kauai. He stored the goods,\nraised a little white flag to show that\nthe building and its contents wero\ntabu, and pursued tho even tenor of\nhis way in peace.\nDoctor Schoof Arrives\nIn 1815 tho Russian governor sent\nan agent, one Doctor Schoof, to secure\nthe property. He camo to the Islands\nas a passengger on tho American ship\nIsabella, Captain Tyler. The Isabel\nla was not bound for Kauai, and the\nDoctor landed at Kailua on Hawaii.\nAfter somo weeks ho secured pass-\nago to Kauai on the Millwood, Cap\ntain Eddcs.\nKaumualll Keeps Faith\nKamehamcha, then tho King of the\ngroup, sent a messenger with Dr.\nSchoof, with orders to Kaumualll to\ndeliver up tho Russian property. Ho\nhad kept it safely, and delivered it\npromptly. Although tho bulk of tho\ncargo consisted of powder and shot,\nwith somo small arms, and notwith\nstanding that powder was in great\ndemand for tho killing of game, Kau\nmualll held his trust sacred.\nShortly thereafter tho Discovery,\nanother Russian vessel, arrived, with\nabout thirty Kodlack Indian, about\nhalf of whom wore females.\nRussians After Seals\nTho Governor of Alaska had heard\nthero was an Island northwest of Kau\nai, whero there wero herds of fur\nseals, and ho had sent tho Discovery\nand her crow on a sealing trip. Ho\nfailed to find either island or seals,\nand returned Waimea. Tho captain\nhad orders to leavo tho Indians in care\nof Dr. Schoof, In case ho failed to find\ntho island and tho seals, and proceed\non his voyage. It Is not unreasonable\nto suppose that somo of these Indians\nintermarried later with tho Hawaii-\nans.\nSuspicions Aroused\nTho Russian ship Myrtle, Captain\nYoung, arrived shortly afterward, and\nalso a Russian brig. Theso anchored\nat Hanalel. Tho arrival of theso sev\neral Russian vessels caused the Ha\nwalians to suspicion that tho Rus\nsians wero preparing to seizo tho isl\nand. This suspicion was strengthen\ned when Dr. Schoof commenced to\nbuild a fort at Hanalel, whero ho had\nmounted several cannon.\nGives Hanalel to Schoof\nSchoof sold somo powder to Kau\nmualll, however, in exchango for san\ndal wood, and gave him a number of\ntrifling presents. In thoso days no\nHawaiian over allowed a haolo to ox-\nceed him in genorosity, and Kaumua\nlll, desiring to show his gratitude,\npresented to Dr. Schoof, as a trifling\nevidence of his esteem, tho entire\nvalloy of Hanalel. Which tho Doctor\ntook without oven winking an eye\nlash.\nKaumualll Wants Fort\nWhen Schoof began to build tho fort I\nat Hanalel, Kaumualll was slightly I\nWORTH\nGIVEN\n1\nInterested. He had never scon a fort\nbefore, but he wanted one. Ho there\nfore offered to pay Doctor Schoof\nto superintend the building of ono at\nWaimea. Tho fact that Doctor Schoof\naccepted the commission did much to\nallay tho suspicion which had been\nentertained by tho natives that the\nRussians were planning to seize the\nisland.\nHowever, thero seemed to be some\nreason for doubting the sincerity of\nRussia\'s friendship. Dr. Schoof at\ntempted to secure from Kaumualli a\nlease of the entire island. He pur\nchased a small American schooner, tho\nLydla, and presented It to Kaumualli.\nThen ho sprung the lease proposi\ntion. Schoof Raises Russian Flag\nTho fort which was being built for\nKaumualll was never completed, but\nwas so far finished that a number of\ncannon were mounted, and n small\npowder magazine was added. How\never, tho wily Doctor Schoof raised\ntho Russian Hag over it. Kaumualli\nfailed to recognize the significance of\nthat act, and allowed It to fly.\nSchoof Plans Massacre\nThen Dr. Schoof planned a big luau,\nto which he invited Kaumualli and\nevery other Influential man on tho\nisland. Tho captain of tho Russian\nbrig, however, having taken a liking\nto Kaufualli, warned him that Schoof\nwas planning to got all tho big men\ntogether and massacre them.\nKaumualll Attends Luau\nKaumualll wont to tho feast, but ho\ntook with him an overwhelming num\nber of retainers, all armed, with in\nstructions to kill every Russian in the\nbunch, in case tho least move was\nmade by any of thorn to harm him or\nany of tho Hawaiians. Many of the\nnatives on tho island had procured\nmuskets from trading schooners, -and\nwhalers, and wero well ablo to pro\ntect themselves.\nWord had been sent to King Kame\nhamcha, however, and to Kalaimaku,\nthe chief of Oahu, of tho suspected\nplot, and tho King sent back word\nto toll tho Doctor to get out, and to\nsee that the order was promptly obey\ned. Schoof Ordered to Leave\nKaumualll sent for the Doctor at\noncq, and told him that ho must leave\ntho island immediately. Ho was\nsent out to his brig that afternoon.\nHe was told that ho could send for\nhis personal effects, but that ho would\nthen bo required to depart with alac\nrity, and remain in a foreign land with\ncontinued persistency. Tho Doctor\nsent his men ashore the next day for\nhis trinkets, and sailed to Hanalei,\nwhore ho had a few more goods.\nThese ho procured and sailed away,\nnever to return. Tho land at Hana\nlel naturally reverted to Kaumualll.\nA short time after the Doctor left,\nanother Russian vessel arrived at Wai\nmea. Tho captain was allowed to so\ncuro fresh water and purchaso sup\nplies, but was advised that the cli\nmate of Kauai was not conducive to\nthe health of Russians. Ho loft.\nSpectator of 1832\nTho history of this matter has been\ncondensed by us from a book which\nIs now owned by Judgo Lylo Dickey.\nIt is a bound volume of a magazine\ncalled tho Spectator, which was pub\nlished in Honolulu in 1832. It is a\nrare volume. In fact. It Is probably\ntho only ono now in existence. It\ncontains many valuable hitorical anil\ndescriptive articles, from which wt\nhopo from time to time to bo ablo to\nquoto.\nPopulation in 1838\nIn ono of tho articles treating of\nthe Hawaiian race, it is stated that\nthe population of tho islands at tho\ntlmo of Captain Cook\'s visit was\n100,000. At tho time tho Spectator\nwas published, in 1J538, thero wero\nbut 100,000. The raliid decrease was\nattributed first to tho excesslvo uso of\nalcohol, and second, to tho vilo dis\neases which had "been introduced by\nCaptain Cook\'s sailors.\nLIGHTLY\nI\n(Continued on pano !\nLihue Averages 4.7 Tons\nThe annual report of tho Lihuo Plan\ntation shows that tho net profits on\ntho crop for 1017 were $974,325. A\ntotal of 21,0100 tons of sugar was ship\nped. Tho average yield per ncro was\n1.7 tons of sugar.\nHeavy Rains Wash Out Rice\nDuring tho fow days of calm weather\nwhich prevailed about a week ago, Jap\nanese and other gardeners along tho\nKawalloa creek bottom planted consld\nerable rice. The unexampled heavy\nrains of tho past fow days, however,\nwashed out most of the rice, and many\nof tho little dikes went out also with\nthe flowing tide.\nBirthday Trip to Hanalei\nCharles F. Loomis, tho Y. M. C. A.\nsecretary for Kauai, celebrated his\nbirthday by taking a trip to Hanalel.\nHo was accompanied by L. A. Wal\nworth, his assistant, and Mrs. Wal\nworth and her mother, Mrs. Hazelrlgg.\nwent. They report that they were roy\nally entertained by W. H. Rico, who\nhai a home in that district, where\nthere Is beautiful scenery and a fine\nbathing beach.\nJapanese Buy Thrift Stamps\nThe younger Japaneso employees of\nKealla plantation have formed a club\nknown as the Y. M. IJ. A for socia\nbility and mutual Improvement. The\nyounger generation of tho Japanese\nhero aro. all persistant pursuers of\nknowledge, and early develop finan\ncial Ideas and business qualifications.\nAt a meeting hold yesterday S.

P1NKHAMJ0 RESCUE\nAnalyzes Water Question As\nIt Affects Lihue Company\nAnd the Homesteaders\nGovernor Plnkham has prepared u\nchart showing what the flow of water\nis for each week In the year In tjp\nKapaa district. It Illustrates very\ngraphically tho water situation with\nreference not only to the Wallua Ian..\',\nbut to the Kapba and Anahola Inula.\nThe chart is very Instructive and\na more out\' ro nf the situation slncve\nt! at the question of how to Bu;\',!y\nsufficient wa\'or for tho several pl.i.i\ntatlons and for tho homesteaders as\nwell, is ono that calls for careful con\nsideration. An analysis of tho chart presents\na number of illuminating facts. Thoro\naro, for instance, within tho Walpouli,\nAnahola, Wallua Mauka, Wallua Kal,\nPlneapplo lease. Homesteads Nos. 1,\n2, 3, and 4 land districts, a total of,\n10,521 acres. Of this total, 7,425 acres\narc now in cano. There aro 3,090\nacres classed as non-agricultural.\nOf the total area In cane, 3.14C acres\naro Irrigated, and 4,279 aro not Irri\ngated. There aro C.G19 acres that can\nbe irrigated, and 80G acres so located\nthat irrigation Is Impossible. North\nof Anaholo there are 245 acres that\naro Irrigated.\nThe requirements for successful\ncano growing are one million gallons\nof water to each hundred acres dally.\nG.S4G acres requires GS,G40,000 gallons\nper day. Tho minimum supply, how\never, is 40,000 gallons. This leaves a\ndally deficiency of 2S.C40.000 gallons\na day.\nIn order to insure a sufficient a-\nmount of water to irrigate the crops\nof plantation and. homestead lands. It\nwill be necessary to supply storage\ncapacity of 52S.000.000 gallons.\nUntil the government came Into pos\nsession of tho North Fork of tho Wal\nlua river canyon, it was not able to\ndovclopo plans which would Insure\nthe collection of water from several\nstreams into one stream, or to provido\nstorage conservation, tunnells, ditches,\netc.\nConferences were held with those\nwhose long residence in tho district\nhad enabled them to know tho con\nditions. It is stated that since the addition of\nHomestead No. 4, and the North Wal\nlua lands, financiers cannot afford to\ntake the chances or make\' loans that\naro secured only on crops, whero in\nadequate supply of water for Irrigat\nion exists. The Governor states \'.hat\nin every case of drought there would\nbo great loss, If not entire failure\nFor tho past two years or so, local\ninterests havo boon disposed to make\ntho necessary investment, on reason\nable financial terms, to conserve, storo\nand properly distribute these waters,\nbut the government\'s hands have been\ntied. Now, however, tho land has been\nreturned to government possession\nthrough tho expiration of the leases,\nand there is no longer n conflict of\nInterests between Llhuo Plantation\nCompany and the Makce Sugar Com\npany. So there now seems no reason\nwhy both land and water matters may\nnot bo rationally arranged. It will\nnaturally take time to carry out tho\nwork, and the war naturally has in\ncreased the demand for tho uso of\ncapital in other lines.\nIt would not seem Just to deprive\ntho maka\'l lands of water that would\nnaturally como to them. Homestead\nseries Nos. 1 and 2 aro situated at an\nelovntlon so great that the Kapaa\nwaters cannot bo got onto them to any\ngroat extent. It Is suggested, there\nfore, that tho solution of the problem\ncalls for tho co-operation of all In\nterests concerned, with a view of tid\ning over tho present difficulties until\nsuch tlmo as more extensive plans\ncan be decided upon looking to tho Ir\nrigation of all lands that can bo reach\ned, whether plantation or homestead.\nTho Governor suggests that in his\nopinion It will bo necessary to clearly\ndofino exactly what will bo needed in\ntho way of conservation and distri\nbution of water, and embody the result\nin a lease or license to bo offered to\npublic competition under proper mini\nmum price and distribution regula\ntions, tho entire system to later be\ncome public property.\nTho government now has applica\ntions for 12,500 acres of cano land, of\nwhich tho government has 1,500 acres\nin possession, with 2,377 acros of cano\nland which will revert to tho govern\nment later on, after tho present crops\nhavo been harvested,', '2\nTHE OARDEN ISLAND, TUESDAY, MAR. 12, 1918\nTHE GARDEN ISLAND\nIssued Every Tuesday Morning\nIf.

I rnjirietur\nJ', 'THE GARDEN ISLAND. TUESDAY, MAR. 12, 1918.\nHanalei the Beautiful Once\nGiven Lightly Away\n(Continued from Pae 1)\nKing Regulates Liquor Traffic\nRecognizing the danger from the\nexcessive use of liquor, Kamchameha\n111. had conferred with the chiefs of\nthe various islands, and had Issued a\nukase prohibiting the sale of Intoxi\ncating liquor except when a written\nlicense had been given by the King.\nOffenders were to be fined fifty dollars\nfor the first offense, and the fine was\nto bo increased fifty dollars for each\nsubsequent offense. The King stipu\nlated that all liquor shops should be\nclosed at 10 o\'clock at night, and\nfrom 10 o\'clock on Saturday night un\ntil Monday morning. It wa provided\nalso that if any one, haole or native,\nshould get drunk, the man who could\nbe proved to have Bold to him liquor,\nshould be fined ten dollars for the\nfirst offense, and the fine should be in\ncreased ten dollars for every subse\nquent offense. Licenses were revok\nable at the will of the King.\nThe aforesaid proclamation, signed\nby Kamchameha III. was published\nin the volume referred to.\nThe number before us contains a\nvery interesting article on the peculi\narities of the Hawaiian language,\nwhich is also quite instructive.\nEarly Schools and Schoolbooks\nIn an article treating of schools, it\nis stated that the principal school\nbooks in use were Webster\'s Spelling\nBook, Bolles\' Speller, Worcester\'s\nTrimer anr Second Book, the Young\nReader, Emerson\'s Arithmetic, Par\nley\'s Geography, Olney\'s Geography,\nand First Lessons in Natural Philos\nophy. Mention is made of the "Cen\ntral Female Boarding Seminary," at\nWailuku, on Maui.\nThe mechanical execution of the pa\nper was in the hands of Hawaiians,\nwho had been taught in the printing\noffice introduced by the missionaries.\nHonolulu\'s Boundaries\nThe population of Honolulu at that\ntime was was 6,000. The limits of\nthe city were described as being\n"from Kewalo on the east, to Kapala\nma on the west, and from the sea to\nNuuanu." Kewalo was a house built\nby the King, and was located "on the\nright of the road leading to Waiki\nki." Kapalama was a district com\nmencing "twenty rods beyond the\ncreek, toward the west." There were\nin Honolulu at that time 250 Ameri\ncans, 100 British, 40 Chinese, and a\nfew scattering Portuguese, Spanish\nand French.\nThere were eleven mercantile estab\nlishments, a cigar maker, one watch\nmaker, several Bhoe makers, one har\nness and saddle maker, several black\nsmiths, several bricklayers and a num\nber of tailors. There were two print\ning offices, one of which was owned\nby the missionaries, and one by the\n"Sandwich Island Gazette."\nThe public buildings included the\nMariner\'s Church, the Oahu Charity\nSchool House, and the Native Chapel.\nCity\'s Area Restricted\nThe town was described as being\n"three quarters of a mile long by a\nhalf of a mile wide." The native\nhouses were constructed principally\nof upright poles, and a light frame\nwork, which was covered with dried\ngrass, of which material the roof was\nalso constructed.\nDuring 1837 there had been exact\nly one hundred arrivals of ships. Of\nthese Blxty-seven were whaling ves\nships. Sandwich Island Gazette\nThere was one weekly paper, the\nWeekly Gazette, which was edited by\nS. D. Mackintosh. The school under\nthe charge of Mr. and Mrs. Cooke, had\nan attendance of 225, while the school\ntanght by Rev. L. Smith had an at\ntendance of 220.\nWreck of Japanese Junk\nThe book contains a very interest\ning account of the Japanese vessel\nwhich had been blown to sea and buf\nfeted by storms until it reached the\nharbor at Waialua, in December of\n1832. The article was written by J.\nS. Emerson, of Waialua. The Junk\nhad left one of the southern islands\nof the Japanese group, bound for Jed\ndo, with a cargo of dried fish. A ty\nphoon came up, and the junk was\ndriven to sea with very little water,\nvery little food, and no charts. They\ndid have a compass, but had no means\nof determining where they were-by\nthe time the storm subsided, as\nthey were without even a sextant.\nThere were nine men aboard when\nthe vessel left harbor, but the food\nwas soon exhasted, and the water\nlasted less than a week. After that\nthey were compelled to depend for\nwater entirely upon the rainfall,\nwhich was often light and infrequent.\nThe vessel was unfit for deep water\nsailing, but the mariners managed\nto keep her afloat. They steered with\nan oar. They were buffeted by storms\nand knew not whither to sail. They\nfinally decided to sail toward the\nrising sun, on the theory that such a\ncourse would eventually bring them\nto land. They were at sea a few days\nless than a year. During that time\nfive of them died.\nOn the last Sabbath in December,\n1832, they sighted Oahu, and came to\nanchor that evening In\' the harbor of\nWaialua. They remained there five\ndays, and were well taken cart of by\nthe natives, who declared that If a\nvessel from Japan could ba blown to\nsea and reach Hawaii, the Hawaiians\nmust have come in the first place from\nJapan or some point in Asia.\nThere was a Chinese sailor at\nWaialua, who thought he could pilot\nthe vesel to Honolulu. He endeavor\ned to do so, but after having been at\nsea two days, the vessel was cast\nashore at Barber\'s Point, on Janu\nanry 1, 1833. The junk and its en\ntire cargo was lost, though the crew\nmanaged to reach shore. The vessel\nwas becalmed, and drifted helplessly\nonto the rocks. The men were taken\nto Hononlulu, where they remained\nabout eighteen months. They were fi\nnally forwarded to Kamschatka thro\nthe generosity of W. French.\nAnother Japanese Wreck\nShortly thereafter another Japan\nese junk was wrecked on the coast of\nBritish Columbia, where all the crew\nexcept three were killed by the In\ndians. These three were subsequently\nbrought to Honolulu, and were ship\nped thence to England, from where\nthey subsequently sailed to Canton,\nand from there reached Japan.\nWe hope to print further excerpts\nfrom the work from time to time.\nThe articles were all written by\nmen who took an active part in the de\nvelopment of the Islands. Mention of\nthe articles and their authors reads\nlike a page from the history of Hawaii.\nAmong the articles and the writers\nof them in this volume may be men\ntioned the folowlng:\nNames of Noted Pioneers\nIntroductory Observations, by P.

Prices are reason\nable. McBryde Store, Agents for\nKauai. Advt.\nCounty Treasurer\'s Report\nCounty Treasurer A. G. Kaulukou\nhas recently made a very Instructive\nreport, showing the amount received\nby the county for licenses issued. The\nreceipts during the past nine years\nwere as follows (exclusive of liquor\nlicenses, which aggregated seven\nthousand dollars per year) : For 1909,\n$10,661.07; 1910, $10,871.76; 1911, $12,\n236.46; 1912, 12.469.20; 1913, $12,496.\n05; 1914, $13,237.60; 1915, $13,660.87;\n1916, $13,858.00; 1917, $15,349.85.\nThis has been collected at much\nless expense than incurred In some\nof the other islands. The usual cus\ntom is for the tax collector to travel\nfrom place to place to collect the\ntaxes. Kaulukou, however, made ar\nrangements with the deputy sheriffs\nin each district, so that they could\nco-operate with him. This resulted\nin the saving of considerable money\nfor the county.\nNot only was the collection of\nlicense fees thus greatly facilitated,\nbut the collection increased over that\nof the previous year in the sum of\n$1,491.85, but the travelling expense\nwas saved thereby.\nThere are now 1380 licensees in the\ncounty, and there are twenty-eight\ndifferent kind of licenses issued.\nThese Include licenses for auctioneers,\nbakers, barbers, butcher shops, slaugh\nter houses, billiard halls, collection\nagencies, drays and wagons, drivers,\ndyers and cleaners, farriers, fishing,\nfood products, garages, hotels, laund\nries, livery stables, merchandise deal\ners, milk dealers, notaries public, cake\npeddlers, merchandise peddlers, pork\nsellers, public entertainments, restau\nrants, and tobacco dealers.\nThese aggregated for the Waimea\ndistrict, of which W. O. Crowell, the\nDeputy Sheriff, acted as collector,\nthe sum of $4,386.90. For the Koloa\ndistrict, of which Deputy Sheriff J.\nNaleimaile was collector, the sum of\n$1,859.20. For Lihue, of which dis\ntrict the County Treasurer was col\nlector, the sum of $7,093.90. For Ka\nwaihau, of which district Deputy\nSheriff J. Hano was collector, the sum\nof $449.05. For Hanalei, where Wm.\nWerner, the Deputy Sheriff, acted as\ncollector, the sum of $706.90. This\nmade the aggregate sum of $15,349.85.\n: o:\nMiss Tabu White Flour is a very\npopular guest on Kauai.

The distance between\nLondon and that favorite seaside re\nsort Is sixty-four miles. The road Is\npicturesque and in summer and early\nautumn It is crowded with private\ncars. But this was not a private car,"\nsays Chas. O. Harper in an interesting\narticle appearing in the February issue\nof MoToIt. "It was, in fact, a char-a-banc,\npublic Bervlce vehicle. I believe\nthere are four of these, running two\nservice each way weekly. At that time\nno one thought much about coal gas\nas a necessary substitute, because\n(although so short a while ago)\nIt was not then foreseen that gasoline\nwould be entirely prohibited for pri\nvate cars or so-called pleasure ser\nvices. Already, however, gasoline had\nbecome frightfully expensive: four\nshillings (one dollar) a gallon, and\nmotorists sighed when they thought of\nthe dayswhen it had been one shilling\nand sixpence (thirty-six cents), or a\nshade cheaper. If, therefore, the cost\nof motor spirit weighed so heavily upon\nprivate users, what must be the burden\nof those who run heavy lorries\n(trucks), trade vans, omnibuses and\nchars-a-bancs! The owners, therefore,\nof those heavy vehicles, consuming so\nvery much more gasoline to the mile,\nwere the first to take up the question\nof coal gas. They had not that ne\ncessity of studying appearances which\nseems so insistent to the private\nowner, and they had, per contra, the\nvery vital need of practicing economy.\nSo those who were using motors for\ntrade purposes made no difficulties\nwhatever about turning over to coal\ngas and having huge gas bags fitted."\n:o:\nAfter Porto Rican Labor\nRoyal D.

P. Clapper of Kauai Garage Co,\na strong supporter of Mlchelln Tires\nsays that: Rust is an enemy of rub\nber. It will pay the motorist to in\nspect occasionally the condition of the\nrims on the wheels of his car, espect\nally if the outer surfaces of the cas\nings near the beads look rusty. This\ndiscoloration is rust caused by rusted\nrims. This rust if not arrested will\ngradually eat through the rubber, at\ntacking the canvas of the tire. In tlm\nthe edges of the rusted rims will be\ncome more and more uneven, tearing\nand eventually destroying the beads\nFurthermore rust works between th\nbeads and the rims leaving space for\nwater which also damages the rubber.\nTo remove rust from a rim, the tire\nshould be taken off and the rusty\nparts rubbed clean with coarse emery\npaper. Then smooth the surface with\nfiner emery paper and re-japan the\nrim, applying one coat to the outside\nand two to the inside, making sure\nfirst that the surface is smooth and\nfree from rust. Roughness may be\nquickly detected by running the hand\nalong the edge of the rim. When the\nedge of the rim is too uneven for the\nuse of emery paper, first use a tile\nafter which emery paper may be used\nfor finishing.\nC. B.

R. Willard, secretary, P. O. Box\n253, Honolulu.\nThe size of the printed pamphlet\n20 pages indicates the importance\nthe agricultural show will assume. In\nfact, the committee has asked for an\namount of floor space equal that re\nquired by any two other departments\nof the fair. Everything edible grown\nIn Hawaii for man or beast is to be\nshown here, in Its very best specimens.\nOf the more common foods there will\nbe a vast number of varieties. Bana\nnas for Instance, will be represented\nby at least twenty different kinds.\nFor every one of such varieties,\nprizes will be awarded in the form of\nribbons, where specimens are up to\nthe high standard which the judges\nthink they should maintain.\nAll formers, gardeners and growers\nof foodstuffs of any kind are invited\nto enter the competitions. No fee\nwill be charged for exhibits, but own\ners are asked to donate them to the\nRed Cross. On the final day of the\nfair all agricultural displaya, except\nwhere owners specify otherwise, will\nbe sold at public auction and the pro\nceeds donated to the Red Cro39.\nOwners may dispose of exhibits at\nprivate sale, but exhibits sold thus\nmust be marked plainly with the upset\nprices, and If sales are made, five per\ncent will be deducted by the fair for\nthe use of the display space as ad\nvertising and marketing medium.\nThis five percent will go into the fair\nfund, which belongs to the territorial\ngovernment.\nNot least among the spectacular\nfeatures of the poultry show at the\nterritorial fair will be an exhibit of\ngame cocks, shown largely by Japan\nese and Filipino fanciers who in form\ner years entertained sport-loving\ncrowds and won their own livelihood\nby the prowess of their feathered\nfighters in the game pit.\nOf course the law no longer permits\nCock fighting but there tre still many\nsmall flocks of these warrior birds in\ndifferent parts of the Islands, cherish\ned by their owners for the fame of\npast deeds of the valor of their an\ncestors. All these fanciers are invit\ned to exhibit their finest and noblest\ncock-fighting strains at the forthcom\ning show. There will be no oppor\ntunity to win game-pit championships\nthere, but judges who know well the\nchampionship marks of the breed will\nbe selected to pick the finest and\naward premiums on points.\nIt, is probable no entrance fee will\nbe charged for any exhibit in the poul\ntry show. All fanciers of birds are\ninvited to enter, but the committee\nannounces that only pure-bred strains\nwill be admitted.\nThe general exhibition will be di\nvided into five classes: Mediterranean,\nAmerican, English, game and bantam.\nIncluded under certain of these will\ncome capons, and in all classes im\nported fowls are to be distinguished\nfrom Biland-bred. Besides the gen\nenal classes a number of special\nawards will be made, and premiums\ngiven in the exxhibitlon of pigeons,\nducks, geese, turkeys and rabbits.\nBlue ribbons will go the heaviest\nTom turkey, heaviest buck and doe\nrabbit, heaviest male and female\nducks and geese.
