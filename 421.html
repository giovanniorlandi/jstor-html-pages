temperance\nunion was unknown Throughout the\nUnited States and in England there\nwere a number of temperance socie\nties but tliey were distinct from each\nother and worked independently\nEven in those days there were some\nwho dreamed of having all the so\ncieties combined under one head to\nfound one grand nonsectarian union\nwhich would take in every prohibition\nsociety In the world Miss Frances\nE Willard was the leading spirit In\nthis new movement and her asso\nciates numbered women scarcely less\nqualified than herself for their chosen\nwork Among them were Mrs Louise\nRounds of
