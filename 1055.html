One who raised himself\nfrom a small beginnings to power in\nthe mercantile world, who turned his\nback on political preferment, who\nwrought mightily for his community\nand state and now dies in the full\nness of age personally mourned by\nthousands.\n“Thinking, trying, toiling and trust\ning is all of my biography,” Wana- j\nmaker wrote to one inquiring into his j\npersonal history. Important as the\nobservation is, the world will insist\non its expansion to proportions more\nfitting the cgreer of one whose indi\nvidual achievements compose so large j\na part of the business history of half [\na century.\nBeginning active life as errand boy ‘\nand door knob polisher for a Market j\nstreet store in Philadelphia at $1.50\na week, Wanamaker made himself the\nbiggest merchant of his time. He was\ncredited with originating the idea of\nthe modem department store which\nhas expanded to become one of the\ndominant influeces in merchandising.\nAnd while thus building his business\nventures into the structure of Ameri\ncan progress he found time for in\ncreasing activity in philantrophy,\nchurch and social betterment work.\nHe was the first paid Y. M. C. A.\nsecretary in the United States.\nWanamaker served as postmaster\ngeneral in the Harrison administra\ntion with credit to himself; and in\n1897 he let his name be used at Har\nrisburg as a candidate for the Senate\n^gainst Quay. He could have had the\nvice-presidential nomination with Taft\nin 1912 but refused the honor.\nIt may be doubted whether Ameri\nca will ever see another “merchant\nprince” of John Wanamakeris caliber.\n—Jackson Daily News.\nMr. and Mrs. H.

It may\nnever be written unless Theo. G. Bil\nbo gets in a reckless mood and tells\nall he knows. He had an opportunity\nto tell his story in federal court last\nweek, but he preferred to “hunt trees,”\naccording to a press dispactch. He\nmust have found one tall enough to\nclimb and safely elude the U. S. mar\nshals.\nIt was an open secret here during\nthe trial that Bilbo dared not come\nas a witness. He would have been\ndamned if had testified for Russell\nand darned if he had testified against\nhim,--say the observers who claim to\nknow the inside of the case. Russell\nwas prepared to challenge him on the\nground that the former governor had\nacted as his counsel and therefore\ncould not testify against his client.\nThere was a persistent underground\nrumor throughout the trial that Bil\nbo’s appearance would be the signal\nfor letting loose the dogs of war with\na fury unprecedented in the history of\nMississippi. The bald, unvarnished\ntruth is that an effort was under way\nto show that Bilbo was the prime\nmover and instigator of the whole\nbusiness. He had fallen out with Rus\nsell over a pardon which the governor\nrefused to issue, according to the\ndopesters, and he set out to “get Rus\nsell.” In his effort to “get Russell”\nBilbo is said to have connived with\nMiss Frances C. Birkhead to bring the\nseduction suit against the governor\nagreeing to testify that he had acted\nas Russell’s agent to compromise the\ncase with the woman.\nEven more serious charges were to\nbe lodged against Bilbo if he had\nshown up in court. It will be re\nmembered that the governor's exact\nwords on the witness stand when ask\ned ab&ut the seduction were:\n“If Miss Birkhead was seduced by\nanyone in the lieutenant governor’s\noffice she was not seduced by Lee M.\nRussell.”\nThose who know Mr. Bilbo well, de\nclare that he figured that he could\nfeather his political nest most advan\ntageously by staying away from the\ntrial. If Miss Birkhead had won he\ncould have claimed the credit openly\ngoing through the inconvenience of\ncross examination under oath. Now\nthat Gov. Russell has won he can say\nto the governor’s friends:\n“I helped him to win his case. If\nI had testified what I knew he never\ncould have won.”\nHowever, Mr. Bilbo seems to have\npleased no one by his actions. The\nRussell folk believe that he was be\nhind the Birkhead suit* The prose\ncutors of the Birkhead case feel that\nhe doublecrossed them bv running to\nthe timbers when the case came to\ntrial.\nBilbo still has his eyes on the gov\nernorship, it is claimed- He would\nwelcome a jail sentence for contempt\nof court, his enemies state, since he\ncould then conduct a theatrical cam\npaign from behind prison bars.—Com\nmercial Appeal.\nJVlKSy- .LUiNlitiS l AiN U\nHEMINGWAY ENTERTAIN\nFriday, December fifteenth, from\nthree to five the Brownings were\ntreated to an Xma.3 party at the home\nof Mrs. Longest, Mrs. Hemingway\nbeing joint hostess.\nEach of the twenty-four members\nbrought an Xmas package bearing\nthe name of some boy or girl at one\nof oqr state industrial schools.

Heard)\n(Second of a series of articles by\nO. H. S. Civics class on City of Ox\nford.)\nThe present school building was\nerected in 1885. The east and west\nwings were added in 1900, because\nthe number of school children was\nrapidly increasing.\nThe Oxford City Schools are under\nthe management of a board of trus\ntees consisting of one trustee elected\nfrom each ward, and one from the\ncity at large. The Superintendent of\nthe School is Mr. P. L. Rainwater, a\n^graduate of the University of Missis\nsippi. In all, there are sixteen tea\nchers.\nThe number of pupils in the school\nthis organization has been and is very\nnoticeable. The Boy\'s Hi Y. €lub has\nfor the last few years taken a part in\nthe School activities, but this year\nthe Hi Y. was not organized. Liter\nary Societies are soon to be formed.\nThe athletics of the High School\nhave been duly stressed, but only a\nhand full of boys reported for prac\ntice during the last season. Mr. Hat\nhorn is the coach, and under his lead\nership a splendid team, light but ag\ngressive, was developed. This team\nwon three and lost three games. The\ngirls, under Miss Drane and Miss Hat\nhorn, are prepairing to develop a\nbasket-ball team.\nBut the School building, under the\nshadow of which all these splendid\nactivities have been and are being car\nried on, is very inadequate to meet\nthe needs of the pupils. The gene\nral opinion among the students is\nthat a new school building is needed.\nThe other day I heard a certain stu\ndent say in reply to another that if\nthe ivy on the front of the building\nwere removed the walls would col\nlapse. In, fact all the outside walls\nshow the effects of age by this lack\nof beauty.\nIt is not the outside that counts so\nmuch. It is the inside. Where a\nschool building is well painted and well\nlghted, with plenty of room, the\nspirit, morale, and general work of\nthe pupils will be better.\nThe halls are very poorly lighted.\nThey are wide enough but the floors\nare very poor, (as is the c^se with all\nthe floors of the building). There\nare cracks between the planks of\nsome of the floors that look like can\nals. The lighting of most of the rooms\nwould pass an ordinary person’s\ninspection. The State Sanitafy\nEngineer for Schools said that the\nlighting of most of the rooms was\nwoefully insufficient. He said that\nthe assembly-hall has duo-lateral\nlighting, from the north and south,\nand that this was not sufficient. The\nfloor surface for each pupil is not\n| enough, neither is the amount of air\nj space sufficient. The walls and ceil\nings have a very good color of paint,\nbut this paint is becoming smeared\nand streaked, and the walls are very\nmuch cracked.\nThe school lacks an auditorium,\nwhere all the pupils could meet to\ngether, and where the patrons and\nfriends of the school could come for\nsocial gatherings. The reading table\'\n(in the hall), which was brought\nabout through the efforts of the Par\nents Teacher Association, is a very\nwelcome addition. The Library is in\nadequate when compared with the\nnumber of pupils enrolled.\nThe heating plant of the building\nis in fairly good condition only one j\nor two rooms being poorlv heated on ;\nsome days. The radiators might be ,\nimproved upon by a little paint, ^’’ere j\nis an insufficient plaoe for tonng j\nthe fuel, only a small spao n the j\nbasement.

The present attitude of the\nstudents is very good, and # as Mr.\nRainwater has said, verv much bet\nter than that of the school year of\n‘21—‘22. The High School offers a\nclassical and scientific course to its\npupils. The majority of the pupils\nare taking the scientific courses. The\nentire High School body as well as\nthe eighth grade uses the large hall of\nthe second story as assembly hall,\nwhich is under the efficient manage\nment of Miss Wright.\nNot many pupils in the High School\nhave failed in even one subject and\nvery few have failed in one subject\nduring the present session. The aver\nage of subjects passed by the girls is\nabout 96 per cent and that of the boys\nabout 86 per cent, so it is an out\nstanding fact that the girls are doing\nbetter work than the boys. Not many\npupils have failed so far in the low\ner grades.\nThe Girl Reserves Hi Y Club was\norganized in the High School in 1920\n1921. It was reorganized in 1921-1922\nand again this year.

It represents an\naggregate investment in lands, in\nmills and cognate industries of $25,\n000,000,000 or over. The South alone\nhas about $1,000,000,000 invested in\ncotton mills, knitting mills and kin\ndred interests, and many billions in\nits production.\nThe development of the cotton in\ndustry during the first half ol the last\ncentury was the greatest business\nachievement during that period in the\nworld. Beginning with a production\nof a few bales in the early years of\nthat century, cotton-growing develop\ned in the South to a point where it\nlargely dominated the finances and po\nlitics of this country and of Europe.\nDurin" the Civil War the famine in\ncotton endangered the %velfare of mil\nlions of people in England. The\npoverty in the Lancashire district\nduring that four-year period stands\nout as one of the awful records in the\nlife of an industrial center. A few\nmonths ago one of the foremost cot\nton manufacturers of England wrote\nto an American friend that the ina\nbility of England to secure its usual\nsupply of American cotton, in any\none year, would cause greater dis\ntress in the Lancashire district than\ndid the War. Millions of people in\nLancashire are wholly dependent on\nthe manufacture of cotton. Millions\nof people throughout the world—hun\ndreds of millions, indeed—are depend\nent for clothes upon the production,\nfrom the South’s staple, of the finish\ned cloth. Millions of people in this\ncountry are directly dependent upon\nthe growing and handling of cotton,\nwhile the financial interests of the na\ntion would be shaken to their founda\ntion by the loss of the cotton trade.\nThe South could weather the storm\nbetter than any other section, because\nthe South could turn its farm lands\ninto the production of diversified ag\nriculture, once more regaining the\nprosperity which never would have\nbeen lost if this section had not by\nforce of circumstances unwisely cen\ntered its agriculture upon the pro\nduction of cotton.\nThis great industry, without which\nthe world could scarcely maintain its\ncivilization—for without cotton clothes\nwe would sink back into barbarism—\nis menaced by the boll-weevil. This is\nnot merely a menace to the South, for\nthe South could stand the shock of\nits cotton crop being destroyed, better\nthan the world could stand the loss !\nof cotton goods. It is a menace to ,\nthe nation—a menace to civilization |\nIt is, therefore, incumbent upon\nevery agency of this Government and\nof all other civilized governments;\nupon chemical manufacturers, cotton\nmanufacturers and financiers, to\nspend money with the utmost freedom j\nin encouraging chemists and others\nto find a remedy for the boll-weevil.\nVarious remedies are being developed;\n| Some of them are more or less sue- j\ni cessful; but the task is very great.\nThe danger of the destruction of the\ncotton industry is so vast that until\nthe whole nation realizes the extent\n$ and importance of that industry and\ni the seriousness of the menace the\ntask will not be tackled on a scale\ncommepsurate with the magnitude of\nthe ’\'roblem to be solved.\nThe world faces a cotton famine;\ncivilization may be at stake by the\nloss of cotton. But we believe a\nremedy will be found. We believe\nthat this crop—in many respects the\n| most important single crop ever given\nby a beneficent Providence to hu\nmanity—will be saved from the de\n| structive power of the boll-weevil, but\nwe believe that the utmost energy\nof the nation must be concentrated up\non the solving of this great problem.\ni ■ " 1\nI PROFESSIONAL\nMISS RUBY McCOY\nNotary Public\nFirst National Bank, Oxford.

HAZARD\n(@, 1922, Western Newspaper Unton.)\nTO US children there was a myste-|\nrlous charm about old Mr. Uplook.’\nHe used to spend a good deal of his\ntime in the back part of his shop, turn-\'\ning bits of mahogany into little boats\nand telling us stories while he chipped\nand polished. He had a small person\nin his throat whom he called Pedro,\nand lie would make him grunt out an\nswers to our questions in a wonderful\nmanner. His vest buttons were con\nnected with several insects, and when\nwe touched them there would come\nout now a bee, then a mosquito, and\nonce in a while a bug that would\nsnap off our noses. The buzzing of\nthe bee, the piping of the .mosquito,\nand the dangerous assault of the snap\nbug gav& us many a thrill and him\nmuch enjoyment.\nOne Christmas time, being rather\nshort of rich relatives and very long\non hope, we conceived the idea of\ndrawing upon the fairy resources of\nour good friend, by suggesting a but\nton that would connect with the good\ngenius of the holidays and bless our\nwishes. So we asked Mr. Uplook If\nhe thought the first two buttons on his\ncoat could by any possibility have any\nthing to do with the Christmas case.\nHe said that he would have to go into\nhis back room and see about it first,\nbut when he came out we knew by\nhis looks that it would be all right.\nWe wanted to press the buttons sev\neral times, but Mr. Uplook thought\nthat once would be enough, and said\nthat in each case we might whisper\ntwo desires, whispering loud enough\nfor him to hear, so that he might be\nsure we were getting the thing\nstraight. So we pressed and whis\npered in that perfect faith that Mr.\nUplook always inspired in us.\nWe were not surprised on Christmas\nmorning when things happened Just\nas we had expected, and kind Mr. Up\nlook seemed just like a real Santa\n<3aus as he stood by the roadside\nwith his camera, taking a picture of\none boy with red-topped, copper-toed\nboots, riding on a new sled; and of\nanother who was trying a pair of\nshining skates on the wayside pond\nand trying to keep a fur cap in its\nplace. And we boys were painting\nupon our hearts a picture of this\ngood friend that has lasted until now. j\nHew Did Auntie Know?\nIt was their second Christmas and\nthe young wife was proudly display\ning the big Christmas remembrance,\nan electric washer, from “friend hus\nband” to the relatives gathered, when\none auntie remarked: “Isn’t that just\ntypical of married life—the first\nChristmas a talking machine and\nthe second Christmas a washing ma\nchine!”\nHall’s Catarrh Medicine\nThose who are in a "run down” condi\ntion will notice that Catarrh bothers them\nmuch more than when they are In good\nhealth.

People of tha Middle West and\nsouthern states demand the Norway spruce, while eastern people want j\nthe balsam. Here are the trees ready for freight shipment, 2,500 of them I\nto the car, tied up in bundles of three to five trees, according to size.\nILL the Christmas tree be\ncome a thing of the past?\nThere are tendencies which\nwould seem to indicate that\na substitute may usurp the\nthrone this green harbinger\nof merriment and good will\nhas held in the hearts oi\nthe people for many dec\nades. One of these influences is\nthe danger of a conflagration in\nthe home where Christmas trees\nare lighted with candles, although\nthis danger is being partially over\ncome by the use of electricity for\nilluminating purposes. Another re\nstrictive tendency is the cost of\nChristmas trees and the growing diffi\nculty of obtaining them.\nMoreover, a conviction is growing\nIn the public mind that it is poor\neconomy to cut Christmas trees from\nthe tops of mature trees or take down\na tree that has been growing for 15\nto 30 years for a one day’s celebra\ntion. The availability of artificial sub\nstitutes and the natural trend toward\na change in the customs of the people\nalso Dear on tne possibility or the\ndisuse of the natural tree.\nThe Yule log succumbed to the\ngreater attractiveness of the Christ- !\nmas tree. And the Yule log had its\npredecessors in the various celebra-, j\ntlons that occurred at the close of the\nold and the beginning of the new\nyear during the first centuries of the\nChristian era.\nThe Christmas tree Is believed to be\na German institution, but the Romans\ncelebrated the birth of Christ about.\nthe middle of the Fourth century by\nthe display of tree decorations, and in\nsome sections of Europe the festival\nwas observed by the employment of\npyramids decorated with green twigs\nand ornaments. Christmas trees should\nnot be cut except from dense growths\nwhere thinning of young trees can be\nmade with benefit to the forest. The\nNew York State College of Forestry\nin the interest of conservation of the\nforests urges tlie adoption of artificial\nsubstitutes for trees in the observ\nances of the Yule-tide festival.\nmmiiiiiiiiimmmiiiiiimmmiriii nr\nTheEvergreenTree\nBy Christopher G.

Sh6 sat be\nfore the decorated and lighted tree\n[that was burdened with gifts that\nseemed to have no destinations. For\n;Mrs. Stone was long past the wanting\n■ of gifts and no companions, young or\nold, sat with her, because she wished\nto be alone with her memories.\nShe was not as alone as she seemed\nto be, for, in the great chair opposite\nto hers memory placed the fairy figure\n,of the child who had glanced and\ndanced about the house and under the\nChristmas tree of long ago. Beside\nher there sat one who seemed to lay\nhis hand again upon hers in happy\nand satisfied affection, while there\nbent over her the strong and tender\nyouth who was once her hope for later\nyears. Again the old house seemed\nfull of joy, and noisy merriment drove\nout the deathly stillness, while the\ntree that is always green spoke of the\nimmortality of happiness.\nThe next day, .when the servants\ndismantled the ■\'evergreen tree, it was\nfound that every gift was marked\nwith a name, and they wrere busy that\nChristinas morning in distributing new\nhappiness about the neighborhood.\n! ,.fr.H.*****-H«***«H^****^*» |\n\' ‘ ;;\ni: Easily Managed ::\n:‘i, n n :i,, „ tn,, i :i, i :i‘i\nYOU must believe in Santa Claus\nIf in neglect you would not pause\nAnd see the holidays drift by\nAnd bring you nothing but a sigh.\nHe may not greet you if you wait\nIn idleness and selfish state\nI For him upon his way to start\nTo grant the wish63 of your heart.\nFor he his ways makes known to men\nff By means that are beyond our ken,\n|f And as his journeying vast is made\n|k He uses many a masquerade.\nI So if a scarcity you fear\nIn the supply of Christmas cheer.\nJust hustle like a willing elf,\nAnd be old Santa Claus yourself\nABBEVILLE CONSOLIDATED\nSCHOOL.\nThe approach of the Christmas hol\nidays is evident in all the rooms, the\nhanging of holly wreaths and mistle\ntoe, blackboard borders and table\nscenes. _ , _\nWe are indebted to Miss McNeil,\nour loyal and efficient County Health\nNurse, for the benefits our school his\ni received. -\nA record of the might of each pupil\nL is made every month and we expect\nf\n\\\n‘\n—- -j\nto buy serials for the school.

That their\nwork has been successful cannot be\ndoubted when it is realized that in\nthese years of selling seals the death\nrate in this country has been cut is\nhalf. The message of such a seem\n| ingly impossible feat is surely worth\nj while spreading.\nFifteen years ago, a woman with a(\nvision, Miss Emily P. Bissell, of\nWilmington, Delaware, conceived the\nidea of raising funds to help in anti\ntuberculosis work of her state. She\nhad read in the Outlook magazine an\narticle by Jacob Riis on the Christmas\ni stamp sold in Denmark for the sup\nport of a children’s hospital,\ni At the time Miss Bissell was secre\ntary of the Delaware Red Cross Chap\nter. With but $40.00 secured from\ntwo friends, as her capital she obtain\ned the official consent of her chap\n! ter and of the postoffice authorities\nto put a few thousand scale mto circu\nlation. Stores, newspapers and\nwoman’s clubs all supported her with\ngreat enthusiasm from the first. Thru\nsuch generous and united effort, three\nhundred thousand, to her number be\nyond all her dreams, were sold that\nfirst year and $1000 was paid on a\nsite of the first tuberculosis sana\ntorium in Delaware, known as Hope\nFarm.\nFrom the beginning, all those in\nterested in the movement realized\nthat their task should be to spread a\nknowledge of the disease, to teach the\npublic that it might be prevented and\nthereby decrease its enormous death\ntoll. From the very start then, the\ncampaign to fight tuberculosis has\nbeen an Educational Campaign.\nAs a result of Miss Bissell\'c demon\nstration and earnest pleading, the\nAmerican Red Cross decided to take\nup the enterprise on a nation-wide\nscale the next year, 1908.

The custom\nof marking the first day of the year\nby festive rejoicing appears to have\nprevailed among ail of the ancient\nnations. The Jew\'s, Egyptians, Chin\nese, Romans and Mohammedans,\nchough differing as to the time from\nwhich they reckoned the commence\nment of the year, all regarded it as\na day of special interest\nIn Rome the year anciently began\nin March; and when Numa, according\nto the ancient legend, made it began\non January 1, that dajfwas held sac\nred to Janus, the two^Taced god, the\ndeity of beginnings and endings, who\nwas thus supposed to turn at once\nbackward upon the old year and for\nward into the new. On the establish\nment of Christianity, the usage of a\nsolemn inauguration of the new year\nvvas retained; but considerable variety\nprevailed both as to the time and the\nmanner of celejblotion.\nChristmas Day, the Annunciation\n(March 26), Easter and March 1 have\nall at different times and places\nshared with January 1 the honor of\nopening the new year; nor was it till\ncate in the Sixteenth Century that\nJanuary 1 was in most countries ac\n;epted as the first day of the new\n/ear. The early fathers—Chrysos\ntom, Ambrose, Augustine, Peter\nJhrysologus and others — in repro\nbation of the immoral and supersti\ntious observances of the Pagan festi\nval, prohibited in Christian use all\nIT takes time to dock a bis airship, just a* it loea to <J**nc a big ship of;\nthe sea.

The\nmandate, however, was but partially\nobserved.\n* The social observances of the day\n\' appear to have been in substance the\nsame in all ages. From the earliest\nrecorded celebration we find notice of\nfeasting, exchanging of gifts and vis\nitjs, and masquerading. There are\nsome customs which time seems not to\nalter, and those of New Year\'s are\nconspicious in this class. Do we no\ntice any change in the manner of\ncelebrating the occasion? Do we ob\nserve any lessening of its f e s t i v e\ncharacteristics? No, it goes along\npretty much as of old, excepting t\neach year it becomes a little more im\nportant and a little more widely\nkept.
