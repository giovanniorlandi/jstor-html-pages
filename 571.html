This gives the Dem\nocrats a majorty of six votes and\ncontrol of the legislature. In an edi\ntorial the Anaconda Standard says:\nThe oflcial dount in Granite is com\nplete; it sustains the first count and\ngives the\' Democrat, concerning whose\ntotal doubt has been raised, a major\nity of six. Meanwhile, with the\nscattered precincts in Custer county\nall heard from yesterday, that cotn\nty\'s vote is complete. It. will be made\nofficially in a day or two, even indeed\nif that is not already done, but there\nappears to be no dispute concerning\nthe Democrat thirty-seven majority.\nThus, bringing forward yesterday\'s\ntotals, none of which are in dispute,\ntie ascertalned joint-ballot vote is\nfifty-four Democrats and forty-eight\nRepublicans. That is, in fact, the\nexact status. If there are counties\nwhere the returns are not officially\ncomplete, there is in any event, no\ncounty where the shadow of doubt\nrests upon the returns for member\nship in either house of the legislature.\nBARBER NEWS .\nMr. and Mrs. Asbury went to Har\nlowton Tuesday morning.\nPeter Maxness sold his horses to\nKnuttson from Shawmut.\nMrs. Babb moved her house upon\nthe hill last Monday.\nMiss Forgeson left last Thursday\nfor her home in Minnesota after a few\nweeks visit with her sister, Mrs. E.
