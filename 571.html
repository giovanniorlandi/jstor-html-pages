This gives the Dem\nocrats a majorty of six votes and\ncontrol of the legislature. In an edi\ntorial the Anaconda Standard says:\nThe oflcial dount in Granite is com\nplete; it sustains the first count and\ngives the\' Democrat, concerning whose\ntotal doubt has been raised, a major\nity of six. Meanwhile, with the\nscattered precincts in Custer county\nall heard from yesterday, that cotn\nty\'s vote is complete. It. will be made\nofficially in a day or two, even indeed\nif that is not already done, but there\nappears to be no dispute concerning\nthe Democrat thirty-seven majority.\nThus, bringing forward yesterday\'s\ntotals, none of which are in dispute,\ntie ascertalned joint-ballot vote is\nfifty-four Democrats and forty-eight\nRepublicans. That is, in fact, the\nexact status.
