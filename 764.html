McKinley\'s plurality will no\ndoubt, be considoinbly reduced through\nthe return to their party of many\nDemocrats who opposed Bryan in 189G,\nand it Is thought also that McKinley\'s\nvote will l;e reduced to some extent on\naccount of the fierce contests of tbe\nQuay, and anti-Quay Republicans to\nobtain control of- the next legislature.\nOutlook In Indiana.\nIndianapolis, Nov. 6.

The Republicans\nare confident of success but the Demo\ncrats claim that if the members of\ntheir party who remained away from\nthe polls four years ago turn out the\nstate will go for Bryan.

Observers who\nare not intensely partisan predict a\nsafe McKinley maigln and a probablt\nRepublican v.ctory on the state ticket.\nOn the latter point, however, they are\ncareful not t,o express in figures their\nopinions. The Democrats are moie\ncombative than heretofore and in ad\ndition to claims of a state ticket walk\nover, are inclined to take Connecticut\nfrom its position in the doubtful col\numn of their tables and edge it over\nto the Bryan column.\n, lleitvv V te In Kalians\nj Topeka, Nov. 6. The Republicans\nclaim a victory In Kansns lor McKin\nley by 25,000 plurality, the success of\nthe state ticket by a plurality some\nwhat less; tho election, of eight con\ngressmen and a majority on Joint; ba\'l.\nlot in the legislature Tho fuslbnists,\nconcede one congressman to the Re-\nfjmbll.cans tyut, claim everything else,\nplacing Bryan\'s plurality at 16,000.

The Democrats claim\n50,000 to 60,000 majority.\nMajority Uncertain.\nFargo, N.D.,Nov 6. Indications are\nthat McKinley will carry this state,\nbut the Republican state ticket will\nget a smaller vote. The state Is, how\never, apparently safely Republican. An\nincrease of 10,000 or 12,000 votes will\nmake the majority rather uncertain.\nCalifornia Close.\nSan Francisco, Nov. 6. Fair weath\ner prevails and a heavy vote is being\npolled.

The lowest pen\nalty for this cfl\'jnse is $50 and costs.\nThe accused entered a plea of guilty,\nbut \'Squire Rice heard the evidence and\nthere was no doubt whatever of their\nguilt. They were fined $50 and costs,\nand failiug to pay or replevy were Bent\nto jail to serve out their fine.\nMonday they still had several days tc\ncomplete their sentence, but the thought\nof losing sixteen votes was too much for\nthe Taylorized Republican leaders, and\nthey set to work to have the gang re\nleased. A writ of habeas corpus was\nsworn out before Police Judge Wads\nworth, but the writ was returned for a\nhearing before County Judge Newell.\nWhen the case came up in the afternoon,\nthe prisoner?, by their attorneys, Judge\nCole and L. W. Galbraitb, filed affidavits\nto swear Judge Newell off the bench,\nclaiming that he was partisan and would\nnot give them justice. The point was\nargued at length by the prisoners\' law-\nyers and by County Attorney O\'Donnell\nand Mr. John L. Whitaker for the other\nside. Judge Newell finally declined to\nsit in the case.\nWhen the writ was first issued, the\nDemocrats decided to notify Circuit\nJudge Harbeson of the proceeding, and\n. requested him to come to Maysville.\nThe law expressly states that such writs\nmust be returned to the Circuit Judge if\nhe is in the county. Judge Harbeson\narrived before tho arguments were con\ncluded before Judge Newell, and wbb in\nthe court room when the latter declined\nto sit in the case.\nJudge Wadsworth insisted ho had juris\ndiction of the case aud when Judge\nNewell got off the bench, the Police\nJudge directed that the prisoners be\ntaken to the Police Court.\nJudge Wadsworth was noUlong in dis\nposing of the case. The proceedings bor\ndered on tho farcical. The Republicans\nwere afraid tho Democrats wore planning\nsome new move, and rushed the case.\nCounty Attorney O\'Donnell asked to be\n, heard, but Judge Wadsworth refused to\nallow him to read sections of the Code\ngoverning such proceedings. Mr. O\'Don\nnell insisted on his rights as an attorney\nbut was shut off, nnd then declined to\nsay anything further.\nTho result of tho proceedings was tho\ndischarge of \'the sixteen prisoners from\njail, tho Court basing his decision, the\nBulletin understands, upon the- ground\nthat the judgment or order committing\nthem to jail was defective, in that it\nstated the prisoners were convicted of\n"playing" craps when it ehou\'d have\nbepn \' shooting" craps.\nSuch proceedings as the Republicans\nhave resorted to the lapt few days to take\na lot of pri oners out of jail simply and\nsolely to vote them, have dipgusted even\nthe better class of their party. This is\nnot the first gang of negro "crap shoot\ners" who have been jailed. Crowds of\nthem have been run in on several oc\ncasions by the authorities of Washing\nton, Mayslick and even here in Mays\nville, but election was at hand and the\nvotes of this Lewisburggangof criminals\nwero needed by the Republicans, aud\nthe good name of the county is being\ndisgiaied by the fact that a lot of prison\ners are released from jail solely for the\npurpose of voting them.\nThere was a proper way to get these\nprisoners out. The balance of their\nfines should have been paid or replev\nied, and then not a word could have been\nuttered in protest, and the good name of\nthe county would not have suffered.\nSee Ray\'s line of fine chocolate candies.\ni\nRay\'s chocolates are fresh from the\nfactory.\n.\nRalston Health Food, oats and flour\nCalhoun\'s.\nFreeh bulk oysters and celery at Bing-\niotti & Co.\'s.\n1 1\nAn electric railroad is projected from\nManchester to West Union and Win\nchester, r .\n... , f 7rt.g\nJ.
