One proxy for paleoecological\nand paleoclimatic reconstructions is the analysis of gastropods (snails) from carbonatic\nriver sediments. In the scope of this study, we investigated gastropod assemblages from a Holocene\nfluvial sediment–paleosol sequence at the upper Alazani River in the southeastern Caucasus. On the\none hand, we aimed to derive reliable independent information about possible long-lasting human\nactivity since the late Neolithic–Chalcolithic in the upper Alazani floodplain. This was formerly suggested\nby n-alkane biomarker vegetation reconstructions from the fluvial sediments. However, the\nreliability of that method is still debated. On the other hand, we aimed to obtain reliable information\nabout a formerly suggested, possibly tectonic-driven, large-scale shift of the river course during the\nLate Holocene. In agreement with the n-alkane biomarkers, our results demonstrate that the studied\nsite was free of the natural forests during the Early and Middle Holocene until ca. 4.5 cal kyr BP. Since\nthis contrasts with a pollen-based vegetation reconstruction from a neighboring floodplain that was\ncovered with forests during that time, the open vegetation in the upper Alazani valley was probably\ncaused by continuous settlement activity as is also indicated by archeological finds in the sequence.\nTherefore, using our paleoecological proxies it is possible that we identified a settlement center in the\nupper Alazani floodplain that was populated from the late Neolithic–Chalcolithic. This center was not\nknown thus far, since the settlement remains are covered by thick floodloam today that hindered their\ndetection during archeological surface surveys. Therefore, our findings suggest that the area in the\nsouthern Caucasus region that was settled during the late-Neolithic–Chalcolithic period should have\nbeen larger than was known thus far. Furthermore, increasing contributions of wetland gastropods\nsince ca. 4 cal kyr BP confirm a local shift of the river course towards the investigated site during\nthe Late Holocene, possibly linked with ongoing tectonic activity. However, in contrast to former\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the Deutsche Quartärvereinigung (DEUQUA) e.V.\n', '248 H. von Suchodoletz et al.: Snail assemblages in Holocene floodplain research\nsuggestions our gastropod assemblages indicate a slow rather than abrupt process. Our study demonstrates\nthe high value of gastropod assemblages for geoarcheological and geomorphological research\nin floodplains with carbonatic river sediments at both a regional and local spatial scale.\nKurzfassung: Für ein besseres Verständnis der spätquartären Landschaftsentwicklung und früherer menschlicher\nAktivitäten wurden während der letzten Dekaden in verschiedenen Regionen Flüsse und deren\nAblagerungen intensiv untersucht. Einen Proxy für paläoklimatische und paläoökologische Rekonstruktionen\nstellen Analysen von Gastropoden (Schnecken) aus karbonatischen Flusssedimenten dar.\nWährend dieser Studie wurde die Artenzusammensetzung von Gastropodengemeinschaften einer\nholozänen Sediment-Paläobodensequenz am oberen Alazani im südöstlichen Kaukasus untersucht.\nZum einen wollten wir fundierte unabhängige Informationen über mögliche landandauernde menschliche\nAktivitäten in der Aue des oberen Alazani seit dem Spätneolithikum/Chalcolithikum erhal-\nten. Eine solche Besiedlung legte bereits eine frühere auf n-Alkan-Biomarkern basierende Vegetationsrekonstruktion\naus den fluvialen Sedimenten nahe, jedoch ist die Verlässlichkeit jener Methode bis\nheute umstritten. Zum anderen wollten wir fundierte Informationen über eine vermutete tektonisch\nverursachte großmaßstäbige Flusslaufverlagerung im Spätholozän erhalten. In Übereinstimmung mit\nder früheren Biomarkerstudie zeigte sich, dass der Untersuchungsstandort bis ca. 4.5 cal. ka BP nicht\ndie natürlicherweise vorkommende Waldvegetation aufwies. Im Gegensatz dazu zeigen Pollenuntersuchungen\neiner benachbarten Flussaue das gleichzeitige Vorherrschen von Wald. Dieser Unterschied\nlässt sich vermutlich durch kontinuierliche Siedlungsaktivität am oberen Alazani erklären, was auch\ndurch archäologische Funde aus der fluvialen Sequenz selbst gestützt wird. Somit konnten wir mittels\nunserer paläoökologischen Untersuchungen vermutlich ein seit dem Spätneolithikum/Chalcolithikum\nbestehendes Siedlungszentrum am oberen Alazani identifizieren. Dieses war bisher unbekannt, da\ndie Siedlungsreste heute durch mächtigen Auenlehm überdeckt sind und somit während archäologischer\nOberflächenbegehungen nicht entdeckt werden können. Somit ist es möglich, dass das\nwährend des Spätneolithikums/Chalkolithikums im südlichen Kaukasus besiedelte Gebiet größer war\nals bisher bekannt. Außerdem zeigen zunehmende Anteile feuchtigkeitsliebender Gastropoden seit ca.\n4 cal. ka BP eine lokale Verlagerung des Flusslaufs in Richtung des Untersuchungsstandorts während\ndes Spätholozäns an, was vermutlich durch andauernde tektonische Aktivität am Südrand des Großen\nKaukasus verursacht wurde. Im Unterschied zu früheren Annahmen zeigen die Gastropen aber eine\nlangsame und keine schnelle Verlagerung. Unsere Studie demonstriert den hohen Wert der Analyse\nvon Gastropodenverteilungen in Flussauen mit kalkreichen Flusssedimenten für geomorphologis-\nche und geoarchäologische Fragestellungen sowohl auf einer regionalen als auch lokalen räumlichen\nSkala.\n1 Introduction\nRiver systems react sensitively towards different external influences\nsuch as tectonics, base level fluctuations, climate\nchanges and anthropogenic activities. Therefore, rivers and\ntheir deposits were intensively studied in different regions\nduring the last decades to decipher the late-Quaternary landscape\nevolution (Bridgland and Westaway, 2008; Schulte et\nal., 2015; Faust and Wolf, 2017; von Suchodoletz et al., 2015,\n2018a, b; Avsin et al., 2019; Lauer et al., 2020). In addition,\nfloodplains were preferred areas of former human activities\ndue to easy access to water resources, fertile loamy soils and\na generally flat topography. Therefore, during the last years\nthey were also intensively studied in the context of geoarcheological\nresearch (Hassan, 1997; Morozova, 2005; Giosan et\nal., 2012; von Suchodoletz and Faust, 2018).\nGeomorphological and geoarcheological research of\nfloodplains and their sediments is generally carried out by\n(i) field-based geophysical and geomorphological analyses\npartly supported by digital elevation or multispectral remote\nsensing data (Bakker et al., 2007; Mlekuz and Budja, 2010;\nSyvitsky et al., 2012; von Suchodoletz et al., 2015; Babek et\nal., 2018) and (ii) stratigraphical and sedimentological analyses\nof naturally or artificially outcropped sediment sections\nor drilling cores. The obtained fluvial sediments are analyzed\nand numerically dated using sedimentological, geochemical\nand geochronological methods (Fuchs et al., 2011; Giosan et\nal., 2012; Schulte et al., 2015; von Suchodoletz et al., 2015,\n2018a, b; Faust and Wolf, 2017; Avsin et al., 2019; Lauer\net al., 2020). In addition, under favorable conservation conditions\nlocal and regional paleoecological and paleoclimatic\ninformation can also be obtained based on biogenic proxies\nsuch as plant macrofossils, charcoal pieces, pollen grains, diE&G\nQuaternary Sci. J., 69, 247–260, 2020 https://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-69-247-2020\n', 'H. von Suchodoletz et al.: Snail assemblages in Holocene floodplain research 249\natoms or leaf wax biomarkers (Kittel et al., 2016; Scott et\nal., 2016; Bliedtner et al., 2018a). Furthermore, similar to\nother sediment archives such as loess–paleosol and dune–\npaleosol sequences or colluvial deposits (Moine et al., 2008;\nFaust et al., 2015; New et al., 2019; Richter et al., 2019),\nalso species distribution and/or isotopic composition of gastropods\nfrom carbonate-rich fluvial sediments were investi-\ngated for paleoecological and paleoclimatic reconstructions\nduring the last years (Fuhrmann, 2008; Zielhofer et al., 2010;\nMurelaga et al., 2012; Alexandrowicz, 2013; Juřičková et al.,\n2013; Granai and Limondin-Lozouet, 2018).\nDuring this study, we analyzed the species distribution of\ngastropods from a Holocene fluvial sediment–paleosol sequence\nat the upper Alazani River in the southeastern Cauca-\nsus that was formerly investigated by von Suchodoletz et al.\n(2018b). Current carbonate contents of sediments and paleosols\nbetween 11 % and 42 % allowed for excellent preserva-\ntion of gastropods throughout the sequence. So far, Holocene\nmalacological studies from the region mainly focused on marine\nor coastal fauna (Lahijani et al., 2009; van de Velde et al.,\n2019), whereas most terrestrial paleoecological studies were\ncarried out using pollen analyses in lakes or peat bogs (Connor\nand Kvavadze, 2008; Messager et al., 2013, 2017; Joan-\nnin et al., 2014; Leroyer et al., 2016; Connor et al., 2018).\nThe first goal of our study was to derive reliable independent\ninformation about possible long-lasting human activity\nin the floodplain since the late Neolithic–Chalcolithic as was\nformerly suggested by n-alkane biomarker vegetation reconstructions\nfrom the fluvial sediments (Bliedtner et al., 2018a,\n2020). Although the n-alkane biomarker vegetation reconstruction\nwas successfully backed by a study on recent n-\nalkanes from the region (Bliedtner et al., 2018b), the reliability\nof this method is still debated (Bush and McInerney,\n2013). The second goal of this study was to obtain reliable\nindependent information about a formerly suggested largescale\nshift of the river course during the Late Holocene that\nwas possibly linked with regional tectonic activity (von Suchodoletz\net al., 2018b).\n2 Study area\n2.1 Study area\nThe 240 km long Alazani River originates from the southern\nslope of the central Greater Caucasus in eastern Georgia\nat ca. 2800 m a.s.l. and finally flows into the Kura River that\ndrains into the Caspian Sea (Fig. 1a). About 40 km from its\nsource the Alazani joins with its right tributary Ilto, which\nalso originates from the southern slope of the central Greater\nCaucasus at an altitude of ca. 2300 m a.s.l. After their confluence,\nthe river mostly runs in the Alazani thrust top basin\nbetween the southern foothills of the Greater Caucasus in the\nnortheast (Adamia et al., 2010) and the Kura fold-and-thrust\nbelt in the southwest (Kura FTB; Forte et al., 2010). The investigated\nexposure at the northwestern tip of the Alazani\nbasin is located ca. 10 km downstream from the confluence\nand has a subcatchment of ca. 1100 km2 (Fig. 1b). From the\nconfluence onward, the Alazani basin has a width between\n4 and 12 km and widens toward the east. Here, the braided\nriver has a width between 250 and 600 m, and its course is\ndeflected by frontal folds and thrusts of the Greater Caucasus\nbivergent orogen (Forte et al., 2014). The gravelly current\nfloodplain is limited toward the south by a scarp of ca. 5–7 m\nthat crops out fine-grained overbank deposits (Fig. 1b). These\nsediments form part of a mainly flat surface with a maximal\nwidth of ca. 10 km that gradually rises toward the Kura\nFTB in the south. The surface is dissected by several small\ncreeks that originate from the Kura FTB in the south and\nare canalized today. As is also indicated by a well-developed\nrecent soil on its top, this surface cannot be flooded by the\nAlazani River today. In contrast, the northern slope is mostly\nrather gradual. Ca. 5–9 km west of the studied site, wellrecognizable\ngravelly former river channels subparallel to the\nrecent river course are found up to 1.5 km northward from the\nrecent riverbed (Fig. 1c). These were suggested to represent\nthe former riverbed that was abandoned due to a large-scale\nshift of the river course during the Late Holocene (von Suchodoletz\net al., 2018b).\nThe upper Alazani basin, in which the study site is located,\nreceives ca. 720 mm of annual precipitation, with a\npeak during spring and early summer that is caused by convective\nevents (Lydolph, 1977). Mean annual temperature\nis about 12.0 ◦C (http://de.climate-data.org/location/28480/,\nlast access: 13 April 2017, station: Akhmeta). Accordingly,\nthe discharge maximum of the Alazani River between April\nand June is dominated by both snowmelt in the Greater Caucasus\nand the annual precipitation maximum; i.e., the river\nhas a pluvio-nival runoff regime. The natural vegetation of\nthe semi-humid upper Alazani basin consists of deciduous\nelm–oak–vine forests (Quercus pedunculiflora, Ulmus foliacea\nand Vitis sylvestris; Connor and Kvavadze, 2008). How-\never, agricultural fields and grasslands cover most of the recently\ninactive elevated valley floor that is outcropped by the\ninvestigated sequence, whereas the active modern floodplain\nhosts scattered patches of deciduous riparian forests (Alnus\nbarbata and Salix excelsa).\n2.2 Studied section\nThe investigated fluvial sediment–paleosol sequence\n(42◦02′17.7′′ N, 45◦21′18.7′′ E; 450 m a.s.l.) is naturally\nexposed with a thickness of up to 7 m along the right bank\nof the upper Alazani River and was formerly investigated\nby von Suchodoletz et al. (2018b). The stratigraphy was\nmapped over a distance of ca. 250 m along the river, and\nthe sediments between 800 and 700 cm were retrieved by\nhand drilling. Sedimentary analyses (carbonate content, total\norganic carbon, pH and mass-specific magnetic susceptibility)\nwere carried out to distinguish in situ paleosols from\noften similar-looking soil sediments. Furthermore, grain\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-69-247-2020 E&G Quaternary Sci.

(2018b) (Fig. 1d).\nThe sequence mostly consists of fine-grained silty to\nclayey overbank sediments (generally > 50 % clay) with\nsome intercalations of coarser-grained sandy to pebbly material.\nSix blackish-greyish to reddish paleosols (Ahb1 to\nAhb6) have formed in situ in these sediments, and a welldeveloped\nsoil (Ah) has formed on the recent surface (Fig. 2).\nAll paleosols could be followed over longer distances along\nthe outcropped sequence, demonstrating the representativeness\nof the stratigraphy. Three intensively developed pa-\nleosols (Ahb1, Ahb5 and Ahb6) show distinct upper but\ngradual lower boundaries, and three weakly developed paleosols\n(Ahb2, Ahb3 and Ahb4) show gradual upper and lower\nboundaries. The age model is based on seven AMS (accelerator\nmass spectrometry) radiocarbon-dated charcoal pieces\nthat were found to be in the stratigraphic order, whereas two\nages had to be rejected, since they were older than the datings\nof underlying deposits (von Suchodoletz et al., 2018b). The\nnon-overestimated ages range between 8.0 and 8.2 cal kyr BP\n(95.4 %) in the upper part of Ahb6 and 1.6 and 1.8 cal kyr BP\n(95.4 %) in the sediments below the recent soil Ah. By using\na soil development index and by referencing this index\nwith the approximate age of the recent soil Ah, approximate\ndurations of soil formation were calculated for all paleosols\nby the differences of the four sedimentary proxies (von Suchodoletz\net al., 2018b). The oldest radiocarbon age of 8.0–\n8.2 cal kyr BP was obtained from a charcoal piece that was\nfound together with archeological artifacts (potsherds, bones\nand obsidian tools) in the upper part of Ahb6. These artifacts\nwere classified as late Neolithic–Chalcolithic, and a fireplace\nin the same stratigraphic position indicates that they originate\nfrom a local settlement and were not transported towards this\nsite (Fig. 2). The radiocarbon age of 2.4–2.7 cal kyr BP was\nobtained from charcoal that was found together with numerous\nIron Age archeological artifacts (potsherds, bones) in the\nupper part of uppermost paleosol Ahb1 (Fig. 2), and singular\npotsherds were also found between Ahb5 and Ahb4 as well\nas in Ahb4.\n3 Methods\nFor the mollusk analyses, we took 12 samples with 10 L of\nsediment each. These comprised six samples from paleosols\nand six samples from fluvial sediment layers of the fluvial\nsediment sequence (Fig. 2). The sediment was wet-sieved to\nobtain the fraction > 500 µm. Subsequently, all macroscopically\nvisible shells and shell fragments were separated. The\nshell remains were determined using a Wild M3Z stereomiE&G\nQuaternary Sci.

We used species\nrichness as a measure of diversity.\nWe used an approach similar to that of Ložek (1964) and\nJuřičková et al. (2014) for the classification of the gastropod\nspecies into ecological groups. With regard to the gen-\neral habitat, we classified the species into open-country, generalists\nand woodland species, and with regard to humidity\nrequirements we distinguished wetland and aquatic species.\nThe allocation of the taxa to the ecological groups is shown\nin Fig. 3.\n4 Results\nA total of 13 gastropod species were extracted from the investigated\nfluvial sediment sequence, namely Pomatias rivu-\nlaris (Eichwald, 1829), Galba truncatula (Müller, 1774), Cecilioides\nacicula (Müller, 1774), Punctum pygmaeum (Dra-\nparnaud, 1801), Oxyloma elegans (Risso, 1826), Chondrula\ntridens (Müller, 1774), Vallonia costata (Müller, 1774),\nVallonia pulchella (Müller, 1774), Vertigo pusilla (Müller,\n1774), Vitrea pygmaea (Boettger, 1880), Helix lucorum (Linnaeus,\n1758), Xeropicta derbentina (Krynicki, 1836), and\nHarmozica ravergiensis (Férussac, 1835) (Figs. 3 and 4). All\nspecies found in the sediments still live in the catchment of\nthe Alazani River. Cecilioides acicula is a burrowing species.\nTherefore, it is possible that at least a part of the specimens\nof this species found in sample 3 originates from overlying\npaleosol Ahb1. However, excluding this species from the following\nanalyses would not affect any of the conclusions.\nThe quantitative and qualitative gastropod distribution\nacross the sequence (Figs. 3 and 5; species list in Supplement\nTable S1) indicated a succession from open-country\nassemblages to woodland assemblages and a subsequent reduction\nof woodland in the youngest layer: the lowermost\nthree samples (samples 12 to 10) were dominated by Vallonia\npulchella and Chondrula tridens, which are species of open\ngrassland. In sample 9 Harmozica ravergiensis, a species\ncharacteristic to open shrub- to woodlands appeared for the\nfirst time. During the formations of layers 9 to 6 the transition\nfrom grassland assemblages to assemblages dominated\nby species characteristic for woodland occurred. This transition\nwas accompanied by an increase in species richness.\nThe lithological units from which samples 5 to 2 were taken\nwere dominated by forest species (Vallonia costata, Vertigo\npusilla, Pomatias rivularis and Harmozica ravergiensis) and\nshow high species richness. Samples 7 to 4 contain Vitrea\npygmaea, a species associated with open xerothermic forests\nor bushland. Sample 2 contained a high number of Pomahttps://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-69-247-2020\nE&G Quaternary Sci.

Higher\nabundances in the paleosols are probably caused by the\nlonger exposure times at the stable surfaces of the paleosols\nfavoring shell preservation. This is a typical phenomenon related\nto paleosols (Ložek, 1990). Whereas the samples from\nthe paleosols probably contain mainly specimens that lived\nat or near the site under investigation, the samples from fluvial\nsediments may also contain shells from more distant\nplaces upstream. Therefore, if there had been forest in the\nupstream vicinity at the time of formation of the deeper layers,\nsome individuals of woodland species would probably\nbe present in the fluvial samples. Consequently, the congruence\nof the trends seen in the samples of fluvial sediments\nand of paleosols indicates that the observed succession from\nopen-country assemblages in samples 12 to 10 and transitional\nassemblages with a mix of open-country and open-\nwoodland species in samples 9 to 6 to assemblages dominated\nby forest species in samples 5 to 2 (Figs. 3 and 5) is re-\ngional rather than restricted to the investigated site. Species\nof undisturbed forest ecosystems and deadwood specialists\nsuch as Caspicyclotus sieversi, Acanthinula aculeata, Vitrea\ncontortula and Scrobifera taurica are completely missing.\nThese species would indicate an old-growth beech forest as\nit exists today on the slopes of the source area of the Alazani\nRiver and its tributaries (Pokryszko et al., 2011; Mumladze\net al., 2017). Instead, species of sparse forests and wooded\nscrubland dominate samples 7 to 2. Accordingly, the parallel\noccurrence of Chondrula tridens and Harmozica ravergiensis\nimplies a mosaic-like arrangement of wooded scrubland\nand open areas. There are several possibilities to explain this\nspecial composition: (i) this could partly be caused by the\nproximity to the active riverbed, as indicated by the occurrence\nof wetland species from sample 5 upward. Likewise,\nMyšák and Horsák (2011) showed that riparian forests in the\nCzech Republic hosted different gastropod faunas compared\nto more distant hillside forests. More humid conditions in riparian\nforests led to a lower tree cover and a significantly\nhigher coverage of the herb layer. Furthermore, although the\nfluvial sediments may contain shells from more distant places\nupstream, given that the fluvial sediments contained few individuals\nin total, the likelihood to record rare species from\nundisturbed forest far upstream is low. (ii) The high proporhttps://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-69-247-2020\nE&G Quaternary Sci. J., 69, 247–260, 2020\n', '254 H. von Suchodoletz et al.: Snail assemblages in Holocene floodplain research\ntion of ubiquitous and drought-tolerant species even in samples\n5 to 2 and the low species richness compared to natural\nforest ecosystems are typical of ecosystems that are influenced\nby humans. Therefore, it is possible that the ecosystem\nat the investigated site was used for grazing in the form of\npasture woodland. This hypothesis is supported by the dominance\nof Pomatias rivularis in sample 2, since Uherkovich\net al. (2008) showed that this species is well adapted to disturbed\nand anthropogenically influenced habitats. Despite the\nmoderately high species richness in this sample indicating\na high diversity of habitats within the archived period, the\nmassive occurrence of Pomatias rivularis may point to a disturbed\necosystem. Human impact is also supported by nu-\nmerous archeological finds in Ahb1, where sample 2 was\ntaken from, indicating a settlement at this place during at\nleast a part of the formation time of Ahb1. Sample 1 shows\nagain a decline in woodland species in favor of open-country\nspecies.\nThe constant absence of the wetland species Galba truncatula\nand Oxyloma elegans in the older samples (12–6) and\ntheir presence in most of the younger samples (5–1) is in accordance\nwith a suggested shift of the river course towards\nthe investigated site during the Late Holocene.\n5.2 Comparison of the Holocene gastropod\nassemblages with other local and regional studies\n5.2.1 Vegetation history of the upper Alazani floodplain\nThe gastropod assemblages in our fluvial sediment sequence\nat the upper Alazani River between samples 12 (Ahb6) and\n10 (Ahb5) indicate that the landscape in the surroundings\nof the investigated site was covered by grassland during the\nEarly Holocene until ca. 5.5 cal kyr BP. In samples 9 and\n8 (Ahb4) a first species characteristic for open shrub to\nwoodlands, Harmozica ravergiensis, appeared, but the assemblages\nwere still dominated by open-country species.\nThese findings confirm a former n-alkane-based vegetation\nreconstruction of Bliedtner et al. (2018a), where paleosols\nAhb6 to Ahb4 also showed a local grass- and herb-dominated\nvegetation signal compared with the proportion of deciduous\ntrees and shrubs (Fig. 5). In contrast to the n-alkanes\nthat are generally not sensitive towards coniferous forests\nand would rather reflect the grassy undergrowth in coniferous\nforests (Diefendorf et al., 2011), the gastropod assem-\nblages trace the distribution of open country versus woodland,\nirrespective of whether the latter was formed by decid-\nuous or coniferous trees (Kralka, 1986; Dedov, 2008). Therefore,\nour gastropod assemblages corroborate the formerly\nsuggested grass and herb dominance in the upper Alazani\nfloodplain during the Early and Middle Holocene. This confirms\nthe very different local vegetation history of the up-\nper Alazani floodplain compared with the neighboring Iori\nfloodplain ca. 40 km to the south. In the latter, pollen analyses\nshowed a dominance of deciduous and coniferous for-\nest vegetation from about 12.8 cal kyr BP, and Salix proportions\nbetween 10 % and 30 % demonstrate that the pollen\nsignal should mostly originate from the floodplain and not\nfrom the surrounding landscape (Gogichaishvili, 1984). In\na wider regional context, the vegetation history of the upper\nAlazani floodplain is also different compared to Lesser\nCaucasus and Anatolian plateau, where pollen from lake and\npeat sediments suggest that reforestation started during the\nEarly Holocene, although relatively late compared with central\nEurope, at∼ 9–8 cal kyr BP (Wick et al., 2003; Messager\net al., 2013, 2017; Joannin et al., 2014; Leroyer et al., 2016).\nHowever, while ecological and climatic conditions of the upper\nAlazani floodplain differ from the Lesser Caucasus and\nAnatolia, they are similar to the Iori floodplain. Thus, the\nmost likely explanation for the different local vegetation histories\nin both neighboring floodplains is local human activity\nin the upper Alazani valley. Accordingly, numerous archeological\nfindings (potsherds, obsidian tools, charcoal and an\nin situ fireplace) in the upper part of paleosol Ahb6 (position\nof sample 12) that were dated to 8.0–8.2 cal kyr BP in-\ndicate local human occupation during that period, and singular\npotsherds were also found in the sediment layer between\nAhb5 and Ahb4 (position of sample 9) as well as in paleosol\nAhb4 (position of sample 8). The regional potential nat-\nural vegetation of the upper Alazani floodplain consists of\nriparian forests in the floodplain passing over into elm–oak–\nvine forests at the slopes (Connor and Kvavadze, 2008), but\nunlike in the neighboring Iori floodplain this potential natural\nvegetation did not develop at the investigated site until\nca. 4.5 cal kyr BP. Therefore, although we cannot derive intensity\nand permanence of late-Neolithic–Chalcolithic settle-\nment and of the following periods from the relatively sparse\navailable archeological data, we suggest that human activity\nfrom that time most likely hindered local afforestation\nat this site for several millennia. However, the distribution\nmap of late-Neolithic–Chalcolithic settlement areas in the\nsouthern Caucasus of Akhundov (2004) does not show human\nactivity in the upper Alazani floodplain (Fig. 6a). The\nearliest known archeological evidence directly from the upper\nAlazani valley is a Middle Bronze Age burial mound\nin the village Zemo Alvani ca. 4 km northwest of the studied\nsite that was built around 3.8 ka (Dedabrishvili and Ru-\nsishvili, 1980; Fig. 1b). In contrast, other regions of the\nsoutheastern Caucasus, including the lower Alazani region\nnext to the Azerbaijan border, were settled by late-Neolithic–\nChalcolithic cultures (Varazashvili, 1980, 1984; Chataigner\net al., 2014; Lyonnet et al., 2016; Hamon et al., 2016; von\nSuchodoletz and Faust, 2018; Fig. 6a). We suggest that thus\nfar missing knowledge about late-Neolithic–Chalcolithic settlement\nactivities in the upper Alazani floodplain with fa-\nvorable environmental conditions for human settlement was\ncaused by the several-meter-thick cover of floodloam that\nhad buried the contemporary settlement remains in paleosol\nAhb6 (Fig. 1d). Similarly, thick coverages of prehistoric settlements\nwith younger floodloam, leading to missing knowl-\nedge about prehistoric settlement patterns, are also known\nE&G Quaternary Sci. J., 69, 247–260, 2020 https://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-69-247-2020\n', 'H. von Suchodoletz et al.: Snail assemblages in Holocene floodplain research 255\nfrom other floodplains (Händel, 1967; Brown, 1997; Bard,\n2015).\nAs indicated by the gastropod assemblages, increased reforestation\ntowards an open woodland at the investigated\nsite started within the sediment layer between Ahb4 and\nAhb3 that was deposited around 4.5 cal kyr BP (sample 7)\nand lasted at least until ca. 3 cal kyr BP (sample 3, between\nAhb2 and Ahb1). Unfortunately, for this period no comparison\nwith n-alkane biomarkers is possible: whereas no n-\nalkane biomarker signal was obtained from paleosol Ahb3\n(position of sample 6), the n-alkane signal from paleosol\nAhb2 (position of sample 4) is not dominated by a local but\nan inherited catchment-derived biomarker signal because of\nthe short time of pedogenesis of only some decades. Therefore,\nthe n-alkanes from Ahb2 should not be interpreted\n(Bliedtner et al., 2018a; Fig. 5). Large parts of the southern\nCaucasus including the region surrounding the upper Alazani\nvalley were settled by the Early Bronze Age Kura–Araxes\n(or Early Transcaucasian) culture from about 5.5 cal kyr BP\n(Akhundov, 2004; Kohl, 2009; Fig. 6b). Therefore, this vegetation\nchange was assumedly caused by local abandonment\nof human land use at the investigated site despite ongoing regional\nsettlement activity or by less intensive land use in the\nform of pasture woodlands (see Sect. 5.1)\nA further change of the gastropod assemblages occurred in\npaleosol Ahb1 (position of sample 2) that had developed between\nca. 3 and 1.7 cal kyr BP: in this soil, gastropod species\nindicative of forests to open woodland are found together\nwith a significant percentage of grassland species (Fig. 3).\nThis indicates a change towards an even more open forest\nwith larger proportions of grassland. It is very likely that\nthis was caused by resuming human activity at this site or\nan intensification of land use, respectively. Increasing human\nactivity at this site or in its surroundings for this time\nis also supported by numerous Iron Age archeological findings\n(potsherds, obsidian tools and charcoal) from the upper\npart of Ahb1 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, from this period burials\nwith Scythian grave goods are known from the Alazani\nvalley (Mamaiashvili, 1980). However, despite a dominance\nof open-woodland gastropod species, the n-alkane biomarker\nsignal of paleosol Ahb1, averaging over the total period of\nsoil development of ca. 1 ka, shows a local dominance of\ngrasses and herbs (Bliedtner et al., 2018a; Fig. 5). Possible\ncauses could be that (i) during most of this time grasses and\nherbs clearly dominated over the forest vegetation, as is suggested\nby a part of the gastropod assemblage, or (ii) the lo-\ncal woodland vegetation was dominated by coniferous trees\nthat do not give an n-alkane biomarker signal (Diefendorf\net al., 2011). However, the latter explanation is rather unlikely,\ngiven that the dominating gastropod species in this\nsample, Pomatias rivularis, typically lives in leaf litter of deciduous\ntrees (Kerney et al., 1983). In the uppermost sample\n1 no woodland species are found anymore, indicating opencountry\nvegetation similar to the current ecosystem.\n5.2.2 Possible shift of the Alazani River course during\nthe Late Holocene\nWetland species of gastropods are absent from the lower part\nof the investigated sequence. In contrast, they occur from\nsample 5 upwards, i.e., since ca. 4 cal kyr BP. This indicates\nthat the investigated site was relatively far away from the\nactive riverbed during the Early and Middle Holocene and\nthat the river approached towards the site during the Late\nHolocene (Fig. 7a and b). Morphologically young former\nriver channels were observed up to 1.5 km north of the current\nriver channel (Fig. 1b and c). Furthermore, the region\nshows a high regional tectonic activity linked with orogenesis\nat the southern margin of the Greater Caucasus (Forte et\nal., 2014), forming the base for river shifts linked with tectonic\nactivity. Accordingly, strong earthquakes that have hit\nthe Alaverdi Monastery located ca. 2 km east of the study site\nare documented for the 15th and 18th centuries CE (Gamkrelidze\net al., 2013; Fig. 7a). Therefore, such a river shift to-\nwards the south during the Late Holocene was already formerly\nsuggested by von Suchodoletz et al. (2018b) to explain\nstrong incision of the sequence that finally led to the deactivation\nof the fluvial archive from ca. 1.6 cal kyr BP. The in-\ncreasing presence of wetland gastropod species in the upper\npart of the sequence confirms this formerly suggested southern\nshift of the river course during the Late Holocene that\nwas probably linked with orogenesis at the southern margin\nof the Greater Caucasus. However, the slowly increasing proportion\nof water-related gastropod species indicates that the\nshift of the river course must have occurred slowly rather than\nabruptly as was formerly suggested by von Suchodoletz et\nal. (2018b), i.e., in the form of preferential lateral migration\n(combing) as a response to lateral tilting of the floodplain\n(Holbrook and Schumm, 1999).\n6 Conclusions\nOur investigations of gastropod assemblages from a\nHolocene fluvial sediment–paleosol sequence at the upper\nAlazani River in the southeastern Caucasus region demonstrate\nthat the studied site in the floodplain was free of the\nnatural forest vegetation during the Middle Holocene until\nca. 4.5 cal kyr BP. This contrasts with a pollen-based Early\nto Middle Holocene vegetation reconstruction in the neighboring\nIori floodplain, showing that this floodplain was cov-\nered with deciduous and coniferous forests from the Late\nPleistocene. Thus, our gastropod data support former nalkane\nbiomarker analyses that are potentially biased due to\ntheir missing sensitivity towards coniferous trees and shrubs.\nTherefore, our data confirm open grass and herb vegetation\nduring that period. We suggest that the open vegetation in the\nupper Alazani valley was probably caused by continuous settlement\nactivity. Although intensity and permanence of local\nsettlement activity could not be determined from our data,\nlocal human activity is also indicated by archeological finds\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-69-247-2020 E&G Quaternary Sci.

Therefore, by using a combination of land\nsnail and n-alkane biomarker analyses of the studied fluvial\nsequence, it is possible that we identified a settlement center\nin the upper Alazani floodplain that was populated from\nthe late Neolithic–Chalcolithic. This center was not known\nthus far, since the archeological remains are currently covered\nby several meters of floodloam that hindered their de-\ntection during archeological surface surveys. Therefore, our\nfindings suggest that the area in the southern Caucasus region\nthat was settled during the late-Neolithic–Chalcolithic period\nmust have been larger than was known thus far. Furthermore,\nincreasing contributions of wetland gastropod species since\nca. 4 cal kyr BP confirm a local shift of the river course towards\nthe investigated site throughout the Late Holocene that\nwas possibly linked with ongoing regional tectonic activity.\nHowever, in contrast to former suggestions our gastropod\nassemblages indicate that this process was obviously slow\nand not abrupt. Altogether, our investigations demonstrate\nthe high value of gastropod assemblages for geoarcheological\nand geomorphological Holocene floodplain research in\nregions with carbonatic river sediments at both a local and\nregional spatial scale.\nE&G Quaternary Sci.
