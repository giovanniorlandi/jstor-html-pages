VQLCKS -XTT,\ni .\nUNFAIR FREIGHT RATES\nTO COAST AND INTERIOR\nTb long and short haul on railroads,\nproperly shortened to the "long-and-short-haul\nIs a problem now before\ncongress embodied In house resolution\nS28, which Is being considered by the\ncommittee on interstate and foreign\ncommerce. An effort is being made to\nobtain a law restraining any railroad\nfrom charging more for a shorter haul\nthan for the longer haul, the shorter\nbring Included in the longer, over the\nname line and In the same direction.\nThis statement is too simple to be\nunderstood. It means that congress is\nlinked to enact a law that will pre\nvent a railroad from charging, say 65\ncents per hundred for hauling cement\nfrom Kansas to Boise, Idaho, when the\nrate over the same line to the coast,\nboo miles farther, is but 40 cents per\nhundred. To the ordinary man this\nstatement is still confusing. Why\nHhould a railroad charge 1 cents per\nhundred less money for hauling cement\nfiUU miles farther? What railroad\nwould be foolish enough to do It?. Why\nneed a law?\nKallroads have done this. Sixteen\nthousand tons of cement used in the\nArrow Rock dam. in Idaho, was hauled\nfrom Kansas, and it cost 148,000 mora\nto haul the cement to Idaho than it\nwould have cost to have had it hauled\n500 miles farther to the coast. A law\nis needed because the railroads wish\nto have the right, under the rulings of\nthe interstate commerce commission,\nto do Just such things. Railroads are\nnot managed by foolish men. What is\nthe motive which is strong enough to\njustify them in fighting against the\npassage of the law?\nThe railroads say that they must\nmeet "water competition" with an\nequivalent rate to coast cities in order\nto get freight that would otherwise be\ncarried by water; and that this freight\nshould be carried by the railroads in\norder that their transportation plant\nshould run at lull capacity and. there\nfore, with the maximum economy. They\nclaim that by taking this business with\na reduced railroad rate there Is a gain\nin revenue, which not only pays the\nout-of-pocket cost of hauling this\nfreight, but which also leaves a sub\nstantial sum which helps to meet the\nexpenses of the entire system; thus\npermitting lower rates to be charged\nover the entire system, and that the\nintermediate points, therefore, enjoy\na lower freight rate than would be the\ncase if the transcontinental business\nwere lost to the railroads.\nRATES TO COAST AND INTERIOR\nSHOW A GREAT DISCREPANCY\nAn Illustration will explain the rail\nroads\' contention. Imagine a railroad\nbuilt between Kansas and the Pacific\ncoast, passing through the site of the\nArrow Rock dam, a point 600 miles\nfrom the western terminal. For sim\nplicity it will be assumed that the\nfixed charges on this road are $128,000\nfor a certain oerlod. during which it Is\npossmie lor tne roau to carry a.-.uoo\ntons of freight. The out-of-pocket\ncost of hauling freight will be assumed\nto be $4 a ton to Arrow Rock dam and\n6 5 a ton to the coast. The freight rate\nto Arrow Rock is assumed to be $11 a\nton, while the rate to . the coast, 600\nmiles farther, is but $8. These rates\nhappen to be rates which once actu\nally existed and which were collected\non the movement of cement used in the\nUam.\nThe most simple cases will be given\nunder this Illustration. The railroad\nhauls 18.000 tons of cement to the Ar\nrow Rock dam at $11 a ton, making a\ntotal revenue of $176,000, but the fixed\ncharges of $128,000 added to the out-of-pocket\ncost of $4 a ton, $64,000,\nmakes a total expense of $11)2,000 and\nthe railroad loses $16,000 on the move\nment. In the second case the railroad\ndoes exactly the same hauling, but In\naddition it also moves another 16,000\ntons of cement to the coast at the rate\nof $8, thus adding $128,000 to its rev\nenue and making the total revenue\nfrom the two movements of cement\n$301,000. The fixed charges remain un\nchanged at $128,000 and the out-of-pocket\ncost of moving the second lot\nof 16.000 tons of cement to the coast\nat $\' a ton comes to $80,000. Thus the\nhauling of the two lots of cement dur\ning the same period gives the railroad\na irain of $32,000. in spite of the fact\nthat the longer haul was made at. a\nlower rate than for the shorter haul.\nIn fact, If the lower rate were not\nmade the cement would probably have\nbeen carried by water.\nThe railroads claim that the reduced\nrate to the coast enables them to i?ive\na low. rate to the intermediate points.\nLet It be said at once that they may\nbe right In this contention, but ven if\nright, yet the principle Is wron and\nthe contention is, therefore, without\nmerit.\nPROBLEM A NATIONAL ISSIE\nSETTLEMENT MIST BE JIST\nI.

Let his friends praise him and\ncongratulate him; let him question\nand criticize himself.\nIt Is Intelligent study, criticism of\nourselves that brings progress, wheth\ner to the Individual or to a great class\nor to that which labor Is an over\nwhelming majority.\nEverything that you see Is the re\nsult of labor from the skyscraper\nwith its steel skeleton to the copper\nwire that carries your messages or\nthe food that keeps you alive..\nTo compare the value of labor and\ncapital Is childish. There is no com\'\nparison possible.\nTake all the gold, all that which we\ncall wealth in the world, and it Is ab\nsolutely nothing without labor to make\nIt productive.\nOn the other hand, put labor naked\non the earth, and soon it will do again\nwhat It has done In the past produce\nthe food, cut forests, drain tho marsh\nes, build the houses and bulll civilization.\nBut the laborer ct any knd who re\njoices in his strength and who ft-els\nconceit proves his sinalluess, whother\nhe be a laborer with pick and shovel,\nor a laborer working at a jreat c!eu\ntlflc problem.\nThe thing for us to do Is to rem em\nber our littleness, our shortcomings,\nand try, by giving full credit to others,\nto deserve credit for our3elvcs. Exchange.\nLABOR left unrestricted and unre\nstrained will produce and fix its\nown reward.\nLabor should have its reward. When\nlabor falls to receive its Just reward,\nconfiscation has happened.\nWhen man Is deprived of his prop\nerty without due process of law, the\nlaw says that Is confiscation and will\nnot be allowed. As labor Is the work\nIngman\'s property, and in most oases\nall the property that he has, the only\ncommodity which he has to sell It\nmust therefore follow that it is as\nmuch the duty of the government to\nprevent the confiscation of labor s It\na to prevent the confiscation of any\nother kind of property, asserts the\nWashington Star. The man who takes\nKore than a reasonable profit on the\nday\'s labor of the workman commits\na crime against good morals, and in\nsuch degree strikes a blow at the\nfoundation of peaceful society.\nSuppose the laboring classes should\ndemand and undertake by force to\ncompel the payment of a sum for their\nservices which all men would agree to\nbe twice its value, what would hap\npen? Immediately the cry would gi up\nthat anarchy was in the loud, and the\nstrong arm of the government, civil\nand military, would bo called out to\nprevent the confiscation of the money\nof the employer, and properly so but\nwhy? Because labor had demanded too\nmuch. But who la the anarchist when\nthe laborer gets too little? It Is a poor\nrule that will not work both ways.\nTEE "member of the anion" Is the\nman that pays only when he Is\n. forced to. Usually comes to the\nmeetings only when he has an ax to\nke ground. He is the man that will\nalways say that the onion has never\nSlven him anything, as he would get\nrood wages if there never was a union\nta existence.

"His .\nname must be some kind of a \'Stalk,\' j\nbut what kind? Corn stalks, bean !\nstalks, and cabbage stalks are the\nonly ktnd of stalks I know anything\nabout so I\'ll Just look them up."\nAnd sure enough, it turned out that\nhis name was "some kind of a Stalk."\nCabbage stalks, in fact, and his Index\ncard was duly changed to read:\n"James Cabbagestalks, (3,721,506)\nMcCall, South Carolina; beneficiaries,\nMrs. Ella Cabbagestalks (wife), Mrs.\nFannie Cabbagestalks (mother).\nYou see that girl wearing the blue\nsweater over there," said one young\nwoman.\nThe girl of the blue sweater appear\ned so young she might have Just left\nschool. She was searching some In\ndex cards, her Angers rapidly running\nfrom one to another. With each flap\nof the card she had taken a mental\nnote of the Inscription thereon, but to\nthe observer she was making a speed\nrecord In touching every card In the\nfile drawer.\nSuddenly Bang I The drawer was\nclosed. She moved a foot to the right,\nbegan another Marathon In card move\nments, selected one, made a notation\non a slip of paper she carried, placed\nthe card among the others, closed the\ndrawer, and walked toward the man\nwho Is in charge of the file section,\nThis pantomime was quickly enacted,\nand as it turned out, it brought to\na close a remarkable case which had\nbeen under investigation for some\ndays.\nTha "Divlt Mystery."\nThe title of this strange case might\nbe the "Divls mystery" with Miss Blue\nSweater as the detective heroine.\nthe barean from an army camp, and\nended as follows:\n"Respectfully.\n"Private Divls Spruce.\nHasting;!, Pa."\nMiss Blue Sweeter waa assigned to\nthe letter with Instructions to secure\nthe man\'s policy number that certain\nInformation requested as to the stand\ning of his insurance might be furnish\ned him.\nThe name of Divls Spruce could not\nbe found In the files. Then came the\ntime for imagination and deduction.\nNo matter how the name was split to\nmake some other plausible name, the\nfiles could not produce results.\nFinally the young woman decided\nto address a letter to the man at Hast\nings, Pa requesting him to furnish In\nformation about himself. In due time\nthe letter was returned to the bureau\nas unclaimed.\n; This did not put an end to the\nsearch by any means. Imagination\nand deduction again were brought Into\nthe case, and a further study of the\noriginal letter was made.\nDivls Spruce,\nSpruce Division.\nOf course ! The Spruce Division 1\nThe Spruce division was a part of\nthe American army.\nMiss Blue Sweater secured a roster\nof the Spruce division from the war\ndepartment and searched through the\nnearly 40,000 names for a man who\nlived at Hnstlngs, Pa.\nIn this she was rewarded. The list\nshowed only one man from that town.\nHe was Herman Miller. With this In\nformation the young woman had no\ndifficulty in finding the card of Her\nman Miller, (policy number 1,877,155;\nserial number 800,255) of Hastings,\nPa. This man was furnished the In\nformation he desired, and in thanking\nthe bureau he admitted he had forgot\nten to sign his name to the letter.\nSearchers From All Sections.\nGirls from every pari of the coun\ntry are employed as searchers. If a\ncomplex case arises Involving a man\'s\nidentification, and his home Is In\nMaine, a girl from that state Is assigned\nto run down the mystery and she near\nly always does.
