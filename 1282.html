Therefore beauty of out\nllno and perfection of finish is tho re\nsult furniture manufacturers strive\nfor when yorklng in these materials.\nRosewood is from a trco called by\nWest Indians, Amyrls; it docs not at\ntain tho great size of tho mahogany\nand its color is not red but a dark,\nrichly veined brown.\nTo keep furniture made from these\nwoods In condition it Is sufficient to\nrub them gently with a soft cloth\nwhen they need dusting.\nThe beauty of these wonderful woods\nis their hardness which makes them\nso durable. Naturally a hard wood,\nthey are especially seasoned before\nthey are used and some factories keep\nchoice pieces of them for years in the\nprocess of seasoning. If a rosewood\nor mahogany piece becomes scratched,\nscorched or defaced, it can be restored\nby a cabinet maker to its original\nbeauty. This is not always the case\nwith veneered furniture. Dampness,\nheat or much Jarring will often raise\ntho veneer and it cannot always bo\nreplaced.\nA delicate Colonial tilt-table of rose\nwood veneer was used for serving tea\nupon until the veneer commenced to\nblister and peel. It was sent to a\nfurniture restore shop. Week after\nweek went by but It was not returned\nand tho owner called on tho workman\nwho showed her the process of resto\nration and said he had been compelled\nto wait until able to match the ancient\nwood. He had matched it In tho case\nof an old molodlan, a beauty in itself,\nand was painstakingly removing the\nveneer from the old piece and trans\nferring It to tho other. This explains,\nIn part, why it is so expensive to have\nold treasures renewed by profession\nals. If you admire mahogany and rose\nwood pieces as they so well deserve,\nand have some of this furnituro to re\nstore, a very good way to do this is to\nfollow the oxample of the Shacklctons;\nthey employed tho most expert work\nman they could hear of to restore and\npolish somo of their "finds" and then\nthey stayed by the workman and took\nnotes with eyes and ears and after a\nfew days they were able to do the\nwork themselves.\n-MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\nAMERICAN TRADE, 1011-15.\nIN\nWashington, D. C Imports of meat\nand dairy products kito tho United\nStates In the ten months preceding\nMay 1 last, were three times the\nvalue of those for a like period two\nyears ago and seven times those of\nthe entire fiscal year 1905. This move\nment, according to the records of the\nliurcau of Foreign and Domestic Com\nmerce, Department of Commerce, first\nassumed largo proportions in tho fis\ncal year 1914, following tho transfer\nof meats, to tho free list. Very re\ncent months, however, have reversed\nthe upward trend, since February,\nMarch and April $how much smaller\nimports than In those months of last\nyear or when compared with earlier\nmonths of tho current fiscal year.\nIn the ten months ending with\nApril Imports of meat and dairy pro\nducts aggregated 38 million dollars in\nvalue, meats representing two-thirds\nof tho total. In 1913-14 tho same\nmonths gave a totnt of 28 million and\nIn 1912-13, 12 million dollars. Prior\nto 1910 tho total never reached 10\nmillion dollars, having been five and a\nquarter million In 1905 and 2 million\nIn 1895.\nOur Imports of meats are mainly\nsupplied by Argentina. Ten months\nof the current fiscal year brought 112\nmillion pounds of fresh beef and veal\nfrom Argentina, and from 10 million\nto 15 million pounds each from Ca\nnada, Uruguay, Australia and tho\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe United States still exports far\nmore meats than it imports, for al\nthough there have been record-breaking\narrivals in the last two years, ex\nports have been oven larger. Re\nturns for ten months Indicate that the\nnlue of meat and dairy products ox\nported this year will onco moro at\ntain tho 200 million dollar level that\nmarked tho decado prior to 1909.\nA study of tho official figures shows\nthat while tho Imports havo consist\ned chlofly of beef and mutton in tho\nprimary stages of preperatlon tho ex\nports havo included considerable\nquantities of bacon, hams, lard, can\nned and nresorved meats, and other\nmeat products In a moro or less ad\nvanced state.\nIn fresh beof there Is now a large\nmovement both Into nnd out of tho\ncountry. Tho largo outward move\nment, however, is a doYolo\'pmont of\nrooent months. Over 25 million\npounds of fresh beof Avero exported\nin April and -moro than 100L million\npounds in tio period from August 1,\n1914, when tho European war began,\ntp tho end of April, 1915; while the\nnggrogate for thb lhrco-ycar period\nending Juno 30, 1914, was only 29\nmillion pounds\nIt is also apparent that tho- United\n\'State pays kf for the tota which\nhi Wys IU itre!iT tor ue i\ntr tf\nf. o.\nb. countries of origin\nmouth wo exported\nIn the sarao\n25 1- \' million\npounds valued at 14 cents per pound\nat tho domestic ports of shipment.

After extensive lab\noratory and service tests the Depart\nment of Agriculture has secured re\nsults which appear to establish defi\nnitely the value of oll-mlxcd concrete\nfor damp-proof construction. De\ntailed results of these tests, which\nwcro carried on In connection with\nthe work of the Ofllco of Public\nRoads are contained in the new bulle\ntin, No. 230, of the Department, en\ntitled "Oil-Mixed Portland Cement\nConcrete." Briefly summarized, the\nconclusions to bo drawn from them\nare that the admixture of certain\nmineral oils in small proportions, not\nto exceed 10 per cent of cement used,\ndoes not lessen the tensile strength\nof mortar; that the decrease In the\ncomparative strength of mortar and\nconcrete Is not serious; that concrete\nmixed with oil takes much longer to\nset hard, perhaps twice as long, but\nthat the Increase in strength Is nearly\nas rapid in the oil-mixed material as\nIn the plain concrete. The use of oil\ndoes not make the concrete impervious\nto heavy water pressure, but it docs\nmake it practically non-absorbent un\nder low heads.\nThe value of oil-mixed concrete is\nsaid to be particularly great in the\nconstruction of basement floors and\nwalls, watering troughs, cistcrs, barns,\nsilos and in all parts of concrete con\nstruction that are to be made damp\nproof. The oil should in no case exceed 10\nper cent of the weight of the cement\nand for the most part, 5 per cent Is\nall that Is necessary. Since a bag of\ncement weighs 94 pounds, 4.7 pounds\nof oil, or about 2 quarts, should be\nadded for each bag of cement used in\nthe mixture. The sand and cement\nshould be first mixed with the proper\namount of water into a stiff mortar, to\nwhich Is added the correct amount of\noil, and the whole mass again thor\noughly mixed until all traces of oil\nhave disappeared. Particular care\nshould be taken to insure that the\noil is thoroughly incoroprated in the\nmixture and the time of mixing\nshould be practically double that when\noil Is not used. For this reason a con\ntinuous mixer should not bo used In\noll-cement-concrete work, as It Is dif\nficult with this typo of machine to\nincrease the time of mixing sufll\nclently. The kind of oil Is also Important\nand the following technical specifica\ntions are suggested In the bulletin in\norder to prevent the use of certain\noils which might tend to impair the\nstrength of the mortar or the con\ncrete. 1. The oil shall bo a fjuld petroleum\nproduct and shall contain no admix\nture of fatty or vegetablo oils,\n2. It shall havo a specific gravity\nnot greater than 0.945 at a tempera\nture of 25 degrees C.\n3. \' It shall Bhow a .fla&h of not less\n"Quality Food for Quality Folks"\nv . i \' niMi\nPdMt ToastilTs site Miffhtv Good!\n1 V 1tfBnRt!lHMMk!tH\nTHISconsumptlvegiri lived in a little\nhouso with her parents and four\nbrothers and a sister. When the\nvisiting nurse of the city called upon\nher she found the whole family in dan\nger of contracting tuberculosis from\nthe young woman through ignorance\nof the proper methods of caring for the\npatient The nurse instructed the\nmembers of tho family about the prep\naration of the girl\'s food and the care\nof her room, so as to give her every\nchance for life. Most important of all,\nthe nurse showed how the disease\ntuberculosis is spread from one per\nson to another through the spit and\nspray from tfce saoofth of a consump\ntive. They wero toragbt that all of the\nexpectorations should be caught In pa\nper boxes or napkins and burned.\nThose Instructions practically Insure\nthe lives of the other members of the\nfamily.\nthan 150 degrees C. by the closed\ncup method.\n4. When 240 degrees C., of the oil\nIs heated in an Engler viscoslmcter to\n50 degrees C, and maintained at that\ntemperature for at least three minutes,\nthe first 100 cc. which flows out shall\nshow a specific viscosity of not less\nthan 15 nor more than 30.\n5. When 1 part of the oil Is shaken\nup with 2 parts of hundredth normal\ncaustic soda, there shall bo no cmulsl\nflcation, and upon allowing the , mix\nture to remain quiet, the two com\nponents shall rapidly separate in dis\ntinct layers.\nFor practical use the addition of\noil will be found particularly useful\nIn the construction of basement\nfloors and walls. Many of these now\nIn existence are continually damp and\nsuch a condition may be remedied by\nthe application of an oil-mixed mortar\ncoat to the old surface. A mortar com\nposed of one part of cement and two\nparts sand and containing 5 per cent\nof oil should be sufficiently non-absorbent\nfor this purpose.\nWatering troughs and clstorns made\nof oil-mixed concrete should also\nprovo of considerable practical value\nIn the conservation of water. In the\nconstruction of,barns, where oil-mixed\nconcrete is used, tho Interior will be\nnoticeably drier than when ordinary\nconoreto Is used. Owing to their dur\nability, cleanliness and resistance to\nAre, concrete barns are becoming\nmore and more popular, but they suf\nfer from the disadvantage that during\na long beating rain the side walls\naro Inclined to absorb moisture, which\nultimately penetrates Into the interior.\nTho addition of oil to the extent of 5\nper cent of tho weight of cement In\nthe concrete used in the side walls\nobviates this objection. Darn floors\ncan also be constructed in tho samo\nway with advantage. A damp-proof\nfloor Is wurniyr because of the lack\nof evaporation from Its surface, and\nIt Is also more sanitary than an or\ndinary concroto floor because of its\nnon-absorbent character.\nTHE quality folks can\'t get a daintier\nor more delicious breakfast dish\nthan Post Toastiesj and yet\nthey\'re so economical that everyone\ncan enjoy them.\nPost\nthe Superior Corn Flakes, are made\nof the best of selected Indian Cornj\ncooked, daintily seasoned, rolled into\nthin bits and toasted to a a delicate\ngolden-brown.\nThese crisp, delightful flakes come\n.in FRESH-SEALED packages, all ready\nto servejust add milk or cream and\nsugar, or any kind of fruit.\nThere arc, of course, any number of\nother types of buildings and structures\nof all sorts In whlh oil-mixed con\ncrete may bQ used advantageously, or,\nIf this is not necessary, a coat of oll\nmlxcd mortar may- be applied effect\nively. Attention is called, however, to the\nfact that extreme care in proportion\ning; mixing and placing tho concrete\nis absolutely necessary if the addi\ntion of any water-proofing agent is\nto bo of value.

C The grades for\ncommercial corn which were promul\ngated by the Secretary of Agriculture\non January 2, 1914, and which went\ninto effect on July 1, 1914, have been\ngenerally adopted throughout tho corn\nbelt and In the cities In that part of\nthe United States and at the Gulf ports\nbut are not In uso In tho cities along\ntho Atlantic seaboard. The grades In\nclude the classification of white, yel\nlow and mixed corn luto six grades\nand "sample" and have been recog\nnized by the Grain Dealers\' National\nAssociation, tho state associations af\nfiliated with this organization, the\nstate grain Inspection department of\nWashington, Minnesota, Illinois, Mis\nsouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and tho De\npartment of Commerce and Industries\nof the state of South Carolina.\nIn order that the producers, dealers\nand consumers throughout the United\nStates may more fully understand the\ncorrect interpretation of tho govern\nment corn grades, somewhat detail\ned explanations are given In tho new\nbulletin of the United States Depart\nment of Agriculture, No. 168, "Grades\nfor Commercial Corn." The classifica\ntion which was made by the secretary\nand became effective July 1, 1914, di\nvided commercial corn Into six class\nes and "sample," the classification be\ning based on the moisture content of\nthe corn, the color, the amount of\ndamage, foreign material and cracked\ncorn. It also included eleven general\nrules for making this classification.\nNecessarily even with the definite\nlimits for the more important factors,\npoints will arise on which the best ex\nperts may differ. For this reason, the\nbulletin gives somowhat in detail\nmethods of securing a representative\nsample from bulk corn, mixing sam\nples for detailed analyses, tho size of\nsamples, sieves for screening, moist\nure tests, determining tho amount of\ndamage of com, foreign material and\ncracked corn.

They were made by An\nthony Blatnor, a goldsmith; of Frled\nburg. They were known as water\nsyringes and in many respects had\ntho appearance of a huge syringe,\nwhich was so placed In a cart of water\nthat had to bo supplied by buckets\nthat It was able to throw a stream of\nwater to the height of ten feet or\nmore.\nThere wns very little Improvement\nin the Blatnor method for a hundred\nyears, or until 1657, when a more elab\norate engine was constructed by John\nIlautsch, of Nuromburg, which was\nmounted on a sledge ten feet long by\nfour feet broad, which was drawn\njy two horses. This machine was\nvorked by twenty-eight men and Is\nsaid to have been able to throw a Jot\nof water one Inch in diameter to the\nheight of eighty feet.\nIt was not until toward tho close\nof the sixteenth century that the hand\nsquirt was introduced into England,\nand they were extensively used in the\ngreat London firo In 1066. Soon after\nthe commencement of tho seventeenth\ncentury the Londonors porcelved the\nconvenience that would arise from\nthese squirts to a movable cistern, and\napplying their power through the\nneuis of a levor, and tho first engine\nthus obtained was considered a great\nmechanical achievement.\nThat these engines were but Im\nperfectly constructed, and deficient In\nstrength, we learn from a rocorded\ncircumstance, that three of them\nthlch wero taken to extinguish a largo\nconflagration on London bridge In\nlitti! and were then considered "such\nexcellent things, that nothing that was\nover devised could do so much good,\nyet none of these did prosper, for\nI hey were all broken,"\nToward tho close of tho seventeenth\ncentury M. Dupcrrler, In Franco ;\nLoupold, In Gormnny, and Xowsham,\nin England, introduced almost con\ntemporaneously fire engines of a very\nImproved description, which soon came\ninto general and extonsivo uso. Tho\nmost novel and Important features of\nthese engines consisted in the employ\nment of an air ohambor, which ren\ndered tho stream of water continuous\nand uniform, together with the equal\nly Important and valuable addition of\ntho flexible leathern hose, of nny re\nquisite length, Invented by the bjpth\ners Jan and Van do JloUJe, and flnrt\ntried by them at Amsterdam In 1672.\nThese machines enable tho stream\nof water to ho convoyed a considerable\ndistance from the engine and directed\nupon tho flames with tho greatest pre\ncision and effect. In tho engine? of\nLeupold, Dupcrrler and some Qttwr&\nono working cylinder pn,ly wa,a em\nployod with an a.fr vessel. These ma\nchinos very much resembled tho com\nmon garden engine of tho present day.\nNowshnm used two cylinders and,\nwhllo various convenient alterations\nand improvements have been, lftqflt\ntho details of this er8foP tho char\nacter and mode of construction adopt\ned by Nowfihum were used up to the\ntlmo the present stylo of steam engine\nwas Introduced..\nThe first practical steam engine was\nmade by John BraUlta about 1829,\nbut, though proved useful in various\nfire? In London for sovoral years after\nthat da,to, It was objected to by the\nmen of the firo brigade and U uso\nwas abandoned. A generation later,\nhoyever, steam (ro engines began to\ncomo Into vogue.\nAt first these engines wero drawn by\nhorses to tho scene of tho fire and it\nU only within the past ten years that\nthe motor-propelled (Iro engine has\ncome into use, Such engines havo tho\nadvantage that they can reach a fire\nmucj more rapidly than tho horse\ndrawn vehlolo.

C "A survey of the\ncoast geography of the British Isles\nshows some things of tremendous in\nterest when considered with reference\nto the blockade undertaken by tho Ger\nmans, tho first serious blockado ever\nattempted against tho United IKng\ndom," begins a bulletin just Issued by\nthe National Geographic Socloty,\nwhich sketches a few otho difficul\nties in tho way of maintaining an ef\nfective blockade of tho many-harbored,\nsea-encircled nation. The bulletin\ncontinues:\n"Great Britain Is a land of harbors\nand highly developed ports. Its for\neign commerce clears from more than\n120 seaports, that aro situated upon\nevery sea washing the islands. To\nshut off English commerce with other\nlauds would require an almost Impos\nsible sea-strength. Moreover, besides\nIts wealth of widely scattered har\nbors, tho United Kingdom has a par\nticularly irregular coastline, which\nwould serve to greatly multiply the\nlabors of a blockades\n"Broken by rocky headlands, bays\nand deeply penetrating Inlots of the\nsea, tho English coastline alone\nstretches for a distance of 2,350 miles.\nTo tho south, upon the Englis channel,\nlies the great seaports of Plymouth,\nSouthampton, Portsmouth, Brighton\nand Dover; to the east, toward tho\nNorth sea, aro tho ports of London,\nHarwich, Great Yarmouth, Hull and\nNewcastle, and to tho west toward the\nAtlantic and tho Irish sea, are Bristol,\nCardiff and Liverpool. Hundreds of\nsmaller ports aro sprinkled In between\nthese great harbors of world-fame.\n"Of these English ports, Liverpool Is\nsaid to havo the best developed harbor\nIn tho world; more coal is shipped\nfrom Cardiff than from any other sea\nport; Grimsby Is the fishing capital\nof tho world, and London is more Inti\nmately connected with the ports on\nevery sea than any other harbor. Eng\nland has expended with freehanded\nforesight \'in the improvement of her\nseaports, and so tho war finds her\nwith adequate harbor facilities upon\nevery hand, with dry docks and ship\nyards In every more Important har\nbor, with equipment to carry on a\ngreat foreign trade from more than\n100 different points,\n"Scotland Is a still more buflling\nproblem to an intending blockader.\nProbably Its most striking feature is\ntho irregularity of its coastline, and\nits coast upon the east is shielded by\nan Intricate mass of bold, rocky is\nlands. Though much smaller in area\nthan England, Scotland has a coast\nlino of 2,300 miles, or ono mllo of\ncoast to every thirteen square miles\nof area.
