She died, at the\nhome of her son, in Keokuk,\nIowa, at eighty-eight years of\nage.\njhe fact, that the parents and\none of the grandparents of Sam\nuel B. Clemmons, better known\nas Mark Twain, were reared and\nmarried there, has caused a be\nlief upon the part of many, that\nthe great humorist, himself, was\na native of the county. This be\nlief led a gentleman, who is now\n(1919) a prominent business man\nof Louisville, Ky,. into an em\nbarrassing situation. While a\nhigh gentleman, with many wor\nthy qualities, he is a very posi\ntive character, especially about\nhis information. He is one of\nthose positive men, whose infor\nmation consists of nothing but\nfacts, and he has no opinions\nnor beliefs. At the time, that\nthe mother of Mark Twain made\nthe visit to Columbia, mentioned\nabove, the gentleman engaged in\na conversation with several la\ndies upon a train, without the\nknowledge that Mrs. Clemmons\nwas one of them. When, for\nsome reason, the name of \' Mark\nTwain was mentioned, the gen\ntleman promptly volunteered the\ninformation, that Mark Twain was\nborn at Columbia. Mrs. Clemmons\nquietly demurred to the correct\nness of the assertion, and said\nthat he mu&t be mistaken. He\nvery positively declared, that\nhe was not mistaken, that he\nhad been shown the house at Co-\n, lumbia in which Twain was born,\nand that his information came\nfrom persons, who were perfectly\nreliable, and could not have" been\nmistaken in their information.\nMrs. Clemmons very quietly\nbegged pardon, and said, that\nshe must have been laboring un\nder a mistake herself for a long\ntime, but that she was the moth\ner of Mark Tfvain, and had al\nways believed, until then, that\nhis birth had occurred in Florida,\nMissouri.\nCOL. tTILLIAM OWENS.\nCol. William Owens, was a\nnoted lawyer and politicians of\nAdair county. He was born in\nFauquier county, Virginia, on\nthe fourth day of May," 1773.

He was\ntwice elected a member of the\nFederal Congress from the dis.\ntrict in which Adair county was\nthen a part, and served as a\nmember of that body with cred\nit and distinction. Throughout\nhis life, he was noted for the\nfixedness of his opinions and the\ntenacity with which he adhered\nto them under all circumstances.\nHe was the author of many max\nimes and aphorisms, some of\nwhich are repeated among the\npeople of the county until the\npresent day.\' In the earlier\nyears of his life, he was often\nwont to say, "that there were\nthree duties, which every man,\nin a new country, owed to it.\nHe must marry a wife, plant an\norchard, and erect a dwelling\nhouse."\nWh6n persons complained of\nprospects being- unfavorable,\nand when the clouds of adversi\nty and misfortune were lower\ning, be dismissed the situation\nwith this profane philosophy:\n"Things get bad; they grow\nworse; and finally become dd\nbad; but- after that, they become\nbetter."\nHe was the father of Col.

"WAR IS MURDER\'\nWhirlwind of Questions Fail to Shake;\nComposure of Man Who Sues for\nMillion Because He Was\nCalled "Anarchist."\nMt. Clemens, Mich. The high;\nidealism of Henry Ford has freshenea\nI the proceedings of the Ford-Tribune\nI libel case and has brought into the\ni wearisome arguments of counsel anu\nj the dull repetition of cross-examiua-\ntions, a new quality.\nFor a week the man who has been\ndescribed as everything from an "an\narchist"to the greatest patriot of his\nday, has been on the stand facing a\nmerciless fire of questions.\nDuring the reading of in article\nwritten by John Heed on Henry Ford,\nend published in the Metropolitan Mag\nazine, the audience in the court cham\nber viulated all precedent by breaking\ninto applause and Mr. Ford, visibly em\nbarrasstd, raised ins hand in protest.\n\'lnuune counsel nad endeavored to\nquote paragrapas iroin the,Keed arti\ncle bu, hau been compelled, by objec\ntion of Ford attorneys, to introduce\nthe interview in its entirety.. In the\nmain it was nighly complimentary to\n.ur. Ford.\n"Make Farmer Independent."\n"What 1 want to do," Mr. Ford was.\nquoted as saying, hs to make the farm\ner as independent as 1 am; independ\nent of the banks, independent of the\ntrusts, independent of the railroads."\n\'iho audience, many of them from\nthe surrounding farms of this commu-\nnitj, showed visible evidence of its ap\nj preciation of that ideal.\nTwice Mr. Ford, wearying of the\nquestions having to do withlns Knowl-\nedge of history, said "Oh, I\'ll admit\nthat I m an ignorant idealist if you\n. wish."\nj "What is an idealist?" queried Tri\nI bunc counsel.\nI The innate goodness of the man\nlighted up his kindly eyes with a new\nj light, as he leaned forward and an\n) swered slowly, "I think an idealist is\ni one who tries to make people happy\nI and prosperous. I think I do "that a\nlittle."\n1 Quiet, unassuming, courteous and\npatient, Henry Ford made a deep im-"\n\' pression on the audience. Not once\nj did he lose his temper under the heck-\n) ling of opposing attorneys, even when\nI their questions verged on the edge of\ninsult. But when the examination\ntouched on subjects which are close to\n( bis heart, the League of Nations, war\nand the happiness and prosperity of\n1 Humanity, counsel found him eagerly\nalert.\n( A League of Nations, or prepared.\nness up to the hilt.\nI That is the way he sees the situa\nj tion today. "We must either," he said,\n) "accept the covenant of peace or dem\nocracy must arm and stand guard for\n\' ever at the threshold of liberty."\n"War Is Murder."\nHe hammered that fact home and\nwith It he always added, "War is mur\nder." "I was a murderer," he said, "I was\na helper of murder. When the cri3ia\ncame-we all took a hand. But it is all\nthe same. War is murder."\ni "What do you mean by murder."\nj "I mean "killing people."\nI "Killing people" to protect the inter\ni ests of the people?"\nI "Killing anybody or anything. I\nI don\'t know what else war is. War is\nmurder. There is a far better way."\n"What is tne better way?"\n"Why, to educate people. To teach\nthem to think for themselves.""\nI A long examination was conducted\nwhich sought to quiz Mr. Ford concern\n\' ing his views on history, based on a\nremark which he once made that "I\nwouldn\'t giva five cents for all the his\ntory ever written."\n"I don\'t think much more of it now ,\nthan I did then," testified Mr. Ford.\n"The war showed us that history\n\' didn\'t last a week. All the things they\nj told us would happen didn\'t happen.\n, They went ahead, knowing what war\nmeant, and made the same mistakes\n. all over again. The history we write\nf today is the thing that counts. I\'m\nnot interested in yesterday."\nThe Flag of Nations.\n, The much discussed flag of a League\nof Nations, which it has been stated\nMr. Ford was having made in his fac\ntory before the United States entered\nthe war, was brought into court. Th6\ntestimony developed the fact that Mr\nFord did not originate the design of\nJ the flag and had never seen the ban-\nI ner itself. He saw a small drawing\ni of It once in St. Paul\'s Cathedral, De-\ni troit, he said, but had never heard of\n\' U 1 J 1 tT.I 1 \'l t\nit again and knew nothing about it.\nHe denied emphatically that he ever\nj said he would raise this, flag above\nthe Stars and Stripes, and said Ihe\nj statement that he reverenced this ban\nI ner above the flag of his . country-was\n"A terrible thing to say about aa Am\nYour Red Cross\nIs Still Busy\nREAD WHAT YOUR\nDOLLAR IS DOING\nRed Cross Peace-Service In\ncludes Continued Care of\nReturning Fighters.\nSINCE the first call to arms\nthe chief aim of the Amer\nican Red Cross has been\nthe comfort and welfare\nof the American boys in service.\nThe Red Cross as an organization\nhas been growing with the growing\nneeds of the soldiers, sailors and ma\nrines since the first transport started\noverseas. \'\nUnder the Department of Military\nRelief of the Red Cross a plan was\nformed and is being carried out which\nbrings every possible comfort and\nhelp to the fighting men jut of lines\nor in sick, well, convalescent,\nmaimed or "whole!"\nHaving taken them comfortably all\nthe way over the Red Cross will con\ntinue to provide for their welfare un\ntil the last man steps off the gang\nplank of the last transport \'or leaves\nthe doorway of the last hospital.\nCare of the returning soldier falls\nInto three branches: Miscellaneous\nService for the Comfort and Welfare\nof Soldiers Home Service in the\nCamp and Recreation. It is difficult\nto say which of these is the most im\nportant, so greatly does each depend\non the other, weaving an all-covering\nmantle of comfort and relief that\nSpreads over each and every soldier.\nHow the Red Cross Helps\nThe soldier is not discouraged, but\nhe can\'t help thinking, as he lies\nthere in the base hospital, with his\nstump of an arm or his tw\'isted knee,\nand waits for the transport that -will\ntake him home.\nWhen the day comes at last, he is\ncarried aboard on a stretcher. Be\nside him are a pair of new pajamas, a\nRp,l Cross comfort kit and plenty of\n"smokes." Aboard there is a Red\nCross man with his hands always\ntilled with "extras." On the way to\nthe debarkation hospital, there is the\niane old Red Cross smile and the suc\nce .sion of sandwiches, pies and coffee.\nAt night, while the train speeds\ntowards the army hospital near his\nDwn town, there are the canteen wom\nen at the stopping places.\nWhen the soldier reaches the con\nvalescent stage, there, is the Red\nCross house with its home-like fea\ntures, easy chairs, rugs, music, games,\nbooks, newspapers and magazines\nthe fireplace, the sun parlor or the\nporch, according to the season. On\nfine days there is the Motor Corps\nthat takes the soldiers for delightful\ncountry spins. It is by these many\n. small attentions, that mean so much,\nthat the Red Cross endeavors to make\n"getting well" easy. A sick or wound\ned soldier does not get well soon if\nLis mind is not happily attuned and\nhis personal troubles at rest.\nSick, convalescent or well, a soldier\nmay have recourse to Home Service,\none phase of Red Cross work. Anxiety\nover home affairs uncertainty over\nthe safety and welfare of loved ones\nhave done more to weaken the morale\nof the men than most grievous wounds\nreceived in battle, or even the endur\nance of short rations, or trying days\nand nights under Are. Red Cross\nHome Service endeavors to bridge the\ngap between the soldier and -his home,\nand to act as the Intervening agent to\nwhom all petitions may be trusted\nand all cares consigned. Five hundred\nRed Cross Home Service representa\ntives are working in the camps of this\ncountry and in the army hospitals,\nwith their 50,000 patients.\nAmong the latest innovations are\nthe banking agencies, established in\ntwenty-two demobilization camps, un\nder the authority of some nearby\nclearing-house or bank, enabling a dis\ncharged soldier to deposit part of his\ndischarge money for transmission to\nany bank he may designate, in ex\nchange for a non-negotiable receipt.\nAt Camp Taylor alone, $152,215 was\ndeposited in this way within the space\nof eleven days.\nThe breadth and scope of the Red\nCross peace program, as it concerns\nthe returning soldier, is readily\nappreciated. He cannot feel neglected\nor forlorn as long as the Red Cross is\nwith him, and surely no possible com\nfort, no possible need has been over\nlooked. The three great arms work\ntogether amicably, smoothly, jointly,\neach performing the tasks that fall\nwithin its immediate field, yet extend\ning its activity to ddvetail happily\nwith the other branches.\nIn the field, in the camp, in the\nhome, the Red Cross is omnipresent\n\' wherever the soldier goes or wherever\nhis interests He. It knows no armis-\ntice ,In Its fight against sickness,\nworry, despair or trouble.\nEditor\'s Note: \'This Is the first of a\nseries of six articles Issued from the\nLake Division headquarters of the\nAmerican Red Cross giving official\ndetails of the peace time extension of\nRed Cross work In accordance with\nthe Ideal of service to humanity which\nIs the basis of all Red Cross activity.\n-PROMPT SERVICE AND SATISFACTION.\nYOUNG TODD,\nCOLUMBIA, KENTUCKY.\nEVERYTHING IN\nROOFING\nAsphalt, Gravel, Rubber, Galvanized\narid Painted.\nAlso Ellwood and (American Fence-\nSfoel Fence Posts "\nDEHLEP BROS.

We\nwant to urge upon the Democrat\nic voters di Adair county the ne\ncessity of becoming active in\nJudge Hardin\'s interest, insist\ning upon every man who believes\nin Democratic principles voting.\nIt is true that the Eighth Con\ngressional district is Democratic,\nbut apathy upon the part of\nJudge Hardin\'s friends might\nreduce the majority. We want\n-to see a full vote polled for the\neffect it will have in the coming\nNovember election. Our Demo\ncratic Representatives in Con-,\n-gress have their eyes on Ken\ntucky and especially the Eighth\ndistrict. They need Judge Har\nbin, in Washington. They know\nJiis ability, and at this time only\nmen who are in perfect accord\nwith the policies of President\nWilson are needed in the halls\nof Congress.\nIf the Democrats of Adair\ncounty will turn out solidly for\nJudge Hardin, he would take it\nas a special compliment, as his\nfather and uncles were born and\nreared in Columbia. His grand\nfather, Parker C. Hardin, came\nto. this town when he was about\ntwenty-on years old, opened a\nlaw-office, and it was here that\nhe lived aDd reared his children,\ndying when he was about seven\nty years old. Judge Hardin\ntakes a great interest in Adair\ncounty people. He rejoices in\ntheir prosperity, and should ca\nlamity come he would be espec\nially grieved. For the first time\nin hii life he is asking the Dem\nocrats of his father\'s native\ncounty to give him their united\nsupport and we believe that they\nwill do it\nThere is a strong sentiment\ngrowing to organize a Turnpike\nCo., to build a toll Road from Co\nlumbia to the Russell Springs.\nThe people of Columbia are vi\ntally interested in the project\nand it is hoped they will get be\nhind the plan and help put it\nthrough.

This statement\nwas called forth by a report\ngaining circulation that he would\nsupport the Republican candi\ndate. Pitzer is busily engaged\nin organizing for his father, and\nhe would be a very ungrateful\nson were he to fail to do other\nwise. All that Mr. Noel, of Harrods\nburg, one of the Democratic can\ndidates for Governor will get out\nof this contest, is, the satisfac\ntion of knowing that the people\nhave been made acquainted with\nhis photograph.

He is just\nfrom France, where he has been\nfor more than a year in actual\nservice, during which time he\nparticipated in tha fightnig at\nVoges, Meuse-Argonne nd were\nin support of Verdun at the\ntime the armistice was signed.\nHe wants it to be- known he is\nfor Judge Charles A.

I am of the opinion that\none who was so. fortunate as to\nget into the officers training camp\nand hold a" Captaincy in America\nwithout going abroador near the\ndanger line, should be grateful to\nUncle Sam for the fine experience\nand training he received without\ndanger to himself. Col. Den\nhardt, who went to the front\nand fought in France, when he\noffered forSGovernor, never men\ntioned the fact, by letter or in\nhis speeches. He reflected in hs\nattitude the true spirit of the\nAmerican soldier, who would not\ndrag their sacred service through\nthe mire of politics for political\npreferment. Judge Hardin, I am\nsure, will stand by the soldier\nboy when he gets to Congress,\nas he did before and that, too,\nwithout boasting."\nPrivate Roscoe Gaither.\nm\nPROHIBITION AMENDMENT\nEditor News:\nAs there seems to be some\nmisunderstanding about the mat\nter, I offer the following state\nment as to the proposed prohibi\ntion amendment to, the State con\nstitution. It seems to be doubt\ned whether any vote will be ta\nken at the next election in this\n\'\nstate.\nIt is true that the eightee nth\namendment (known as the Pro\nhibition Amendment) to the Con\nstitution of the United States\nhas been ratified by a sufficient\nnumber of States to make it part\nof the Federal Constitution. It\nwas ratified by the Kentucky\nLegislature by Joint Resolution\nNo. 2 at the 1919 session. This\nFederal amendment provides as\nfollows:\n"After one year from the ratifica\ntion of this article, the manufacture,\nsale or transportation of intoxicating\nliquors within, the importation there\nof into, or the exportation thereof\nfrom the United States and all terri\ntory subject to the jurisdiction there\nof for beverage purposes is hereby\nprohibited.\n"Section 2. The Congress and the\nseveral states shall have concurrent\npower to enforce this article by ap\npropriate legislation."\nBy January 16, 1919, three\nfourths of the states had ratified\nthis amendment and the Secre\ntary of State at Washington is\nsued his proclamation stating\nthat the amendment had been\nratified and would take effect\none year from that date,that is,\non January 16, 1920.\nI think there is practically no\ndoubt that this amendment will\ntake effect at the time stated.\nHowever, there has been a ques\ntion raised as to the legal; ty of\nthe ratification in a number of\nStates.\nNow, as to state-wide prohibi\ntion. The 1918 session of the\nLegislature proposed to the peo\nple of this State the following\namendment to the State, Consti\ntution. "After June 30, 1920, the manufac\nture, sale or transportation of sqiritu\nous, vinous, malt or other intoxicat\ning liquors, except for sacramental,\nmedicinal, scientific or mechanical\npurposes, ia the Commonwealth of\nKentucky is hereby prohibited."\nThis amendment is to become\npart of the State Constitution\nwhen ratified by the voters of\nKentucky. The election on this\nquestion is to be held in Novem\nber, 1919. It could not be held\nlast year, for the reason that\nsuch an amendment can be vot\ned on only at an election at\nwhich members of the Legisla\nture are chosen.\nIt would take too much space\nto state the reasons why I think\nit is -important that the people\nshould ratify this amendment to\nr the state constitution; It may\nSTYLE,\n.

The chances\nare that it will. But certain\ncomplications in the enforcement\nof national prohibition are cer\ntain to arise. For instance, two\nVf&rds in the Federal amendment\nmay give rise to much difficulty:\nthe words "concurrent power"\nin Section 2 (see above.) Some\nof the difficulties that may arise\nin enforcing national prohibition\nin the state can be obviated by\nhaving state prohibition, which\nthe state can enforce by its own\nmethods and according to its\nown laws. If the people of this\nState want the fullest authority\nto enforce prohibition in their\nown way they should certainly\nadopt the prohibition amend\nment to the State Constitution.\nLilburn Phelps.\ni i\n. -j\nLED BY REACTIONARY.\nWashington, July 23 (Associ\nated Press.) The League of\nNations was supported in the\nSenate today by "Senator McECel\nlar, Democrat, Tennessee, as one\nof the greatest forward steplTin\nthe Nation\'s history. Most of\nthe opposition, he asserted, came\nfrom "reactionaries" of the\nsame school as tkgsa who oppos\ned tht Federal Constitution and\nthos who later handicapped the\ngrowth and development of the\ncountry.\n\'\'There have always been re\nactionaries in our country," said,\nthe Tennessee Senator, "and\nthere have always been pro\ngressives. There have always\nbeen forward-looking men anp\nbackward-looking men. There\nhave always Eeen men who\nlooked to precedents and to the\npast and menwho looked to" the\niuture.

We ought to im\nprove upon those who have gone\nbefore us. We have had better\nadvantages than they had. They\nblazed the path. Every dictate\nof conscience, every dictate of\nhumanity, every dictate of an\nenlightened self-interest, every\ndictate of a desire for peace, re\nquires the establishment of this\ngreat world pact.\n\'\'Reactionary Republicans and\nreactionary Democrats who are I\nopposing this league, don\'t let I\nyour hatred tof any one man warp 1\nand set aside your judgment, i\nWhatever may be said of Mr t\nWilson, he-has-surejy done great\'\nthings for America.

Senator Knox, he\nsaid, had desired to go even far\nthan than the league covenant in\nhis resolution declaring the\nUnited States would co-operate\nto remove any future menace to\nEuropean peace.\n"The real criticism of -the\nleague in the minds of its oppo\nnents in the Senate," continued\nMr. McKellar, "is that\' Wood-\nrow Wilson took a\ncommanding\nVALUE\nFancy Dress B\nQ\nDAVENPORTS\nt ".\na\nKentucky\n4\npart in the rormation of the\nleague. There may be better\nplans, but why haven\'t they\nbeen produced?"\nThree incontestible reasons for\nthe leagues, continued the Sen\nator, are the cost of war, its sac\nrifice of human life and "the ut\nter folly of creating nations in\nEurope without giving them the\nguaranty of life." He said he\ndid not agree that Article 10 im\nposed only a moral obligation to\ngo to war to preserve the integ\nrity of members, but that it\nrightly imposed a legal obliga\ntion to do so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE JOHN D.

For Jfurther\nparticulars see v f\nThis sale will take place on \'the\nfarm.\nEE\nRabbi Leon\nIsrael\nHarrison, Noted Temple\nPastor, Pleads for\nMore Service.\nRabbi Leon Harrison, noted pastor\nof Temple Israel, St. Louis, who has\ndelivered ringing addresses through\nout the nation in all war activities, has\ndriven home his first nail in the Gov\nemment\'s platform of the Victory Lib\nerty Loan.\n"There are some who fear that the,\npublic may be luke-warm in this new\nVictory Loan drive, because they\nthink that the war is over.\n"But the war is not really over un\ntil the treaty of peace is signed. It\nIs not over until every man in the\nAmerican Expeditionary Forces has\nbeen brought back to his natiye soil\nand to his home. It is not over until\nevery sailor that enlisted for the war\nin the United States Navy shall have\nbeen demobilized.\n"But in the meantime we must sup\nport these millions cf sailors and sol\ndiers. We must pay them, and shel\nter them, and feed them. And we\nhave to pay, our bills incidental to the\ngreat war, whose battles are now\nended, but not its financial conse\nquences. "Your taxes are not enough, how\never heavy they may be. The revenue,\nof the Government is far from being\nsufficient. The American Government\nis obliged to borrow money to pay\nits running expenses, because these\nare still war expenses. We must still\nsupport our army and our navy. We\nmust pay the bills for what our Gov\nernment has ordered during the past\nyear for the victorious conclusion of\nthe great war."\nThe buying of your Government\'s\nobligations, Dr. Harrison says, is not\nonly a fine investment, but a splendid\nact of patriotism and devotion to the\nfreest gbvernment on earth.\nGame Is Not Over\nPessimistic talk about the floating\nof the Victory Liberty Loan? Hasn\'t\nthe world always had its pessimists?\nIn the hour of supreme crisis, when\nthe final stroke for victory is to be\nmade, is the time the slacker and\npessimist gives up the "game."\nA baseball enthusiast was ap\nproached by one of the world\'s af\nflicted: a doubting Thomas who\ncould not possibly see America going\ninto her pockets and "putting up" for\na few billions for another loan.\n"It cannot be done," he dolefully\nconcluded.\n"It can be done," the other man\nsnapped, his eyes speaking for him\nthe language of the true sporting\nspirit that may die, but is game to\nthe last ditch.\n"You haven\'t said a word about \'Vic\ntory\' Loan, but you have been talking\nabout a defeated loan. Do you know\nhow Billy Sunday would answer your\nargument? And you bet your sweet\nlife Billy is right there with good old\nAmerican punch too. Here is what he\nsays about it:\n" \'Why, you little simp of perdition,\nyou are quitting the game with two out\nand two strikes on and the "batter\nup." Put over that last ball and put\nhim out! Give the "Hun" that last\nwallop that gets "the count"!\'"\nIs Billy right? All the world may\nnot always agree with Billy at all\ntimes, but all the good old United\nStates knows that he talks good sound\nhorse sense when he puts the baseball\npunch into the "game" we are playing.\nThe boysplayed a life and death\ngame on the other side.

Many plain\nMr. Americans are rushing in where\nwise men fear to tread and are "fall\ning" for the advertisements without\nthought of why the other fellow wants\nthe bonds.\nAdvertising, especially the kind\nLiberty Bond brokers are using, costs\na lot of money. Where does the buyer\nget off? Well, be ure he is getting\noff else he wouldn\'t advertise. He\nisn\'t in business for his health. He is\nafter the money. It\'s a cinch you are\nhelping him to a big rake-off when you\ntrade or sell your Liberty Bonds.\nThat\'s sense, isn\'t it?\n"if a Liberty Bond is worth, say,\n?95\'to the broker after he has paid\nfor all cf his expensive advertising,\nit certainly is worth par or more than\npar to the holder. For on top of his\nadvertising expenses the broker main\ntains costly offices and much help. 4\nThat\'s sense, isn\'t it?\nThe reason the broker wants the\nbonds is that he or his clients want\ntohold them. It\'s the broker\'s busi-j\nness to know bond values. He knows\nthat these Liberty Bonds .are going to J\nbe valuable things that they are go-j\nling \'way above par within a year on\n\'tVO.\' I\nHold them yourself.\nPRAISES "ARMY"-\nEvangeline Booth, Commander\nof the Salvation Army in the\nUnited States, received the fol\nlowing letter from David Lloyd\nGeorge : \'\n"British Delegation,\n"Paris, April 8, 1919.\n"Dear Madnni I have very\ngreat pleasure in sending you\nthis letter to say how highly I\nthink of the great work which\nhas been done by the Salvation\nArmy amongst the Allied Armies\nin France and the other theaters\nof war.

Their reputation and successful record mean security for your money.\n1 TEXAS CHIEF was your first chance to make a large return on your money. This company has a gusher, and paid a dividend of 300 per cent. July 15th.\n\'This well was brought in about May 25, 1919. Rather a remarkable investment wasn\'t it? And just think five more wells are to be drilled on the 25 acre leasS fur\nther increasing the income. Some people in Kentucky were wise enough to buy this stock, and one of these dividend checks can be seen at Jeffries Hotel, in Columbia.\n2 HARTFORD was the second chance you had to make another good investment. This well was on the oil sand ten days ago, and is undoubtedly another\ntgusher, as 20 feet of rich oil sand was reported by the driller. This company\'s stock sold for two and- one-half when the sand was found and should be worth far\nsnore now, and will be another big dividend payer.\n3 UNITED CHIEF can still be bought nd now is the time to buy it before the price advances. It has 77i acres in the great gusher field near Texas Chief\nIHartford and many others. Theo. Combest; vice president of Texas Chief, and a director of the Hartford, is president of the United Chief. A. C. Dulaney, vice pres\nident of Texas Chief, and Sec\'y.-Treas; of the Hartford, is Sec\'y.-Treas. of the United Chief. These are men who stand high in the esteem of all who know them and\nIheir record in Texas Chief and Hartford certainly assure you of a square deal in the United Chief. .\nWell No. 1 will begin immediately on the 50 acre -tract in Block 833, .between Texas Chief and the Cauble Oil .Co. Well No. 2 will be drilled oh the acre\ntract in Block 820 between Burk Waggoner and Ramming wells. The company\'s other 20 acres is one and one-half miles from Red River opposite the Texas Chief.\nThe company receives 7-8 of all oil, and\' two wells will be drilled. Figure for yourself pour profits when we bring in good wells on this large acreage. Our driller is\nconfident of a. good well and we are betting strong on it too.\nRemember one good investment is worth a lifetime of saving. United Chief with its large acreage in the greatest oil field in the world, and its strong, clean,\nand successful management offers you a good investment. GRAB YOUR opportunity to-day.

My faith\niaihe.oeople has received ample justification in the fact that the rank and\n;jteofthe;Democratic voters are for me in this race. The machine politicians\nr-are&Jlng all within their power to encompass my defeat.

They state that they were delegates from Knox County, to "the Republi\ncan State Co\'nvention held in Louisville, Kentucky, on July 17, 1903, at which\nconvention Morris B. Belknap was nominated for Governor, and John A.\nBlack, of Barbourville, was nominated for Treasurer. They state that the\nsaid James D. Black was not a delegate from Knox County to that convention\nand did net attend said convention. They say that James D. Black has been\na consistent Democrat in politics as long as affiants can remember.\nThey make this affidavit in the interest of the truth, and in view of the\nfact that certain persons are undertaking to disseminate a falsehood against\nthe said James D.

McDONALD,\nNotary Public, Knox County, Ky."\nSTATEMENT NO. 3.\nIn the same advertisement, \' Black\'s Political Record," the said Logan\nstates I "made a loan of 32,500 to Caleb Powers, then under indictment." The\ntruth is I never loaned Mr. Powers a cent while he was under indictment, or\nor at any other time. But some five or six years ago, and\nwhile Mr. Powers was a member of Congress, I loaned to Dr Samuel Bennett,\na cousin of Mr. Powers, 37,500. At the time I made said loan to Dr. Ben\nnett, said Bennett was making extensive real estate purchases in Southeas\ntern Kentucky. Some time after the loan to said Bennett, by some arrange\nment agreeable to himself and Mr. Powers, Mr. Powers agreed to, and did as\nsume a portion pf said 87,500 loan, amounting to $2,500 But this was not\nwhile Mr. Prowers was under indictment, as Logan states, but was while Mr.\nPowers was a member of Congress\nIn the appendix of the Congressional Record, page 140, a list of Caleb\nPow.ers"indebtedness is given by Mr. Powers, which contains the following\nitems in Mr. Powers\' own language: To Judge J.- D. Black, Barbourville\n(borrowed by Dr. Bennett,) $2,500."\nPowers\' own statement shows that said $2,500 was "borrowed by Dr. Ben\nnett," as explained above by me, and M. M. Logan purposely refrains from\nstating that truth, and in so doing, the Congressional Record convicts him of\na deliberate" attempt to fool the Democrats of Kentucky while pretending to\ngive them the truth. This fabrication is Logan\'s clumsy attempt to make\nKentucky Demorats believe I was financially assisting Powers while Carroll\nwas bolting Goebel. My, what a clever politician you are. Mr. Logan!\n, I\'have ah" abiding faith in the integrity of, the voters of this" State, and-T\ndo not beileva they will be mteled\'b\'y the character of campaign that is beW\nwaged against me in my xaoe fer the Deoaoeratio nomination for Governor.
