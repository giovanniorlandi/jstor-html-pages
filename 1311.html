The\ncommittee is composed of himself, Jus\ntices Lurton and Van Deventer, the\nonly members of the Supreme court\nwho have had experience on the bench\nof the United States circuit court. Jus\ntice Lurton since 1893 and Justice Van\nDeventer since 1903.\nThis move is the Initial step in a\ngreat reform In federal court pro\ncedure, which has long been advocated\nby Justice White, who has often criti\ncised the antiquated practice on the\nchancery side of these courts.\nThe present rules were promulgated\nin 1842. They are adapted in their en\ntirety from the ancient rules of the\nhigh court of chancery of England,\nand are cumbersome and complicated\nin the highest degree, lending them\nselves to delays and embarrassing liti\ngation rather than expediting causes.\nIt is significant that the rules from\nNation Has a Great Naval Scrap Heap\nTHE fate of the battleship Texas,\nonce the pride of the United States\nnavy, recently sent to the bottom of\nTangier sound, in Chesapeake bay, by\nthe guns of her sister ships, as an ex\nperiment in naval science, has called\npublic attention to the prodigious size\nof the nation’s naval scrap heap.\nNot only is the government spending\nmore than $G6,000,000 on its new\nDreadnaughts now under construction,\nbut It is throwing away annually mil\nlions of dollar*’ worth of battleship\nconstruction of the older type, now\nconsidered out of date.\nOn the naval junk pile in the last\nton years 36 vessels have been\ndumped. They cost the government\nto build, or to buy ready built, $9,803.-\n495.50. From the sale of the refuse\nbarely three per cent., or $289,029.41,\nhas been received.\nThe ships which have been destroy\ned outright are but the smaller part of\nthe number of abandoned naval ves\nsels which total 36 in the past ten\nyears.

He is\nhalf-tramp, availing himself of all the\nhobo’s expedients for gadding about\nthe world without paying for his trav\nels, and half-man with a trade, the\ngoal of whose rambles is always a job.\nHe has all the “bum’s” philosophical\ncontempt for the man so "easy” as to\n“ride the velvet,” which means to pay\nrailroad fare. But he also incurs the\n"bum’s” astonished disdain because of\nhis incorrigible habit of looking for\nwork. i\n"We travel - Wanderlust, from\nlove of adventure,” explained an ex\n"gay cat,” who had Joined the "home\nguard” of those who have ceased from\nrambling. “When I was a youth I\nwanted to see the country, and see It\nright. I wanted excitement. I had a\ngood trade and was living at home,\nbut the lure of the road called me.\n“I could have paid car fare and rid\nden in the railway cars, but you can’t\nsee the country that way. What man\nlooking through the windows of a Pull\nman car, knows anything about the\nregions through which he has passed?\nYou must travel a few hours at a time,\non a slow freight, and be thrown off\nat the most unexpected places by\nbrakemen, to see the country. You\nwant to mooch (beg) a handout at\nbackdoors to get acquainted with peo\nple. You even learn something when\nsome ‘fly mug’ (detective) gets so cor\ndial that he insists on your staying in\nhis midst for 30 days —on the rock\npile. What dude in a palace car can\nlearn as much about his native land\nas I did in 14 years as a \'gay cat’?”\nThe Wanderlust Never Dies.\nThis man was a miner by trade, and\nhad followed the profession from\nPennsylvania to California, and from\nCalifornia to Alaska. He never begged\nsave in an emergency of hunger, and\nusually bad SI,OOO or so tucked away\nIn a bank in this city or that. But it\nwas only after many years of wander\ning as a knight errant of the pickax\nand shovel that the wanderlust of his\nyouth was quenched and he settled\ndown to be a prosaic hotel clerk.\nIn the shabby sitting room of a 10-\ncent lodging house in St. Louis there\nlounged recently half a dozen weather\nbeaten and hardy men, self-confident\nof mien and monosyllabic of speech\nIn their short words was none of the\nwhine of the professional beggar, and\nin their straightforward look was noth\ning of the hangdog. They had trav\neled to most of the countries of the\nglobe, and, ignorant of alien languages\nand customs, had supported them\nselves by the sole resource of their\nown hands. They were confident of\ntaking care of themselves in any situ\nation.\nWho would have thought that the\nsqualid parlor, into which the warm\nsun filtered, was a place of dreams?\nBut so It was. The taciturn little En\nglishman in the corner, who was born\nin South Africa, was gazing into space\nupon the yellow corn fields of the Ar\ngentine Republic, upon construction\ncamps in the Andes, and upon broad\nroads leading by gentle stages through\nthe pampas from one hospitable ranch\nto the next. Aroused from his artic\nulate vision by a question, he stated\nIn‘a matter-of-fact way that he would\nbe in Argentine next fall.\nThe booted, gigantic Swede was\nthinking of logging camps in Minne\nsota, of perilous drives to the lakes, of\nfist-to-fist battles between champions\namong the snows. Another, in his\nmind’s eye, beheld the sunny orchards\nof California; another imagined him\nself helping build steel bridges in\nMexico. The sap of spring was rising\nin their veins, and, like birds of pas\nsage, they were impatient to be off. A\nfew more weeks would see them scat\ntered to the points of the compass,\nensconced in box cars and on blind\nbaggages, but all bent on the quest\nof their "golden fleece” —the perfect\njob.\nSome would fall by the wayside—\nmangled or slain beneath the wheels\nof trains, and would be burled in the\npauper graveyards maintained by the\nrailroads for their vagabond, victims.\nThe "gay cat” believes that his con\nstitutional right to the pursuit of hap\npiness includes the privilege of rid\ning on trains without paying fare.\nThe most he will do is to pay 50\ncents to a "shack” (brakeman) for\npermission to ride unmolested over\nhis division. Frequently a supposed\nvagabond crouching painfully in a\nbrake-beam has SIOO in his pockets\nand a bank book for several hundred\nmore. But he would have suspicions\nof his own sanity should he spend any\nof his money for the comforts and re\nspectability of a seat In a railroad\ncoach.\nwould take no heed. These dreams\nalso take possession of women. It\nseems that vagabonds have ranks no\nless than the courts of Europe. At the\ntop, in his own estimation, is the wan\nderer who rejoices in the proud title\nof “bum.” His class are the chosen\npeople, the Brahmins of vagrancy.\nThey have no patience wdth the "gay\ncat.” who has the vice of wishing to\nwork. Below the “gay cat,” whose oc\ncupations are versatile and include all\nthe skilled trades, are the “hoboes,”\nwho. strictly speaking, are railroad\nconstruction laborers. Lowest of all\ncome the “sclssor-bills,” or green\nhorns. sometimes called “apple knock\ners,” in opprobrious reference to their\nrecently abandoned agricultural pur\nsuits. The different classes, of course\noverlap. A “scissor-blll” may develop\ninto a “hobo.” a “gay cat,” a “bum"\nor even a “yegg.”\nBut the "gay cat” is a clannish crea\nture and flocks to himself. In the in\ntervals between his travels he usually\nlives with others of his kind in lodging\nhouses. If he is prosperous, he takes\na room at 25 cents a night. If he is\nfinancially embarrassed, as he often\nis. he “rides the broncho” or “rides\nthe camel.” In other words, he sleeps\non the top or the bottom shelf of dou\nble-decker beds at a dime a night.\n“Gay Cats” With Money.\nThe “gay cat,” in an emergency, h\nnot abashed at begging a meal at a.\nbackdoor. But as he has more self\nrespect, be usually employs greater\nart and skill in his “mooching” than\ndose a “bum.” One roving mechanic\naccosted an astonished housewife with\nthe question:\n“Madam, have you a hatchet?”\n“What do you want with a hatchet?”\nshe countered, suspiciously.\n“I want to knock my teeth out," an\nswered he With solemnity.\n“Lands alive!” almost screamed the\nwoman. “Why should you knock your\nteeth out?”\n“What’s the use having teeth if you\nhave nothing to eat?” was the re\nsponse. The “gay cat” obtained one\nof those rare feasts known in the ver\nnacular as a “sit down ”\nAN EYE TO BUSINESS.\nA dressmaker had sent her servant\nto post a letter and was anxiously\nwaiting her return.\n“Did you post my letter all right.\nMary?" she asked, as the maid of all\nwork entered.\n“Oh, yes, ma’am,” replied Mary,\nholding a penny out to her mistress.\n“What is this for?” again asked the\nfair employer. “I gave it to you for\nthe stamp.”\n“I didn’t have to use It, ma’am.

They are aroused as never be\nfore in the history of the state. If not,\nwhy are they flocking to hear Varda\nman by the thousands and ten thou\nsands? More lies, more people. The\nbigger the lies, the bigger the crowds.\nThousands of the toiling, God-fearing,\nGod-serving men, women and children\ngreet him everywhere he goes. His path\nis strewn with flowers and praises and\nblessings of childhood and womanhood\nare lavished upon him by the graceful\nand admirable multitudes. Why is this?\nIs it because of his personal popularity?\nMost emphatically it is not. True, he\nis popular as a man. His natural kind\nness and warm sympathy for others\nmake him so, but no man who simply\nrepresents himself would ever enlist the\nattention and attract the throngs of\nthousands that gather to hear him, and\nhaving heard him press upon each other\nto grasp his hand. It is because they\nknow that he stands for what they love,\nand in opposition to what they despise.\nHe stands for honor, and they are hon\nest. Ho stands for light rather than\ndarkness, and they love the light. He\nstands for sobriety, and they are sotxt.\nHe stands, the victim of, and in opposi\ntion to, bribery, perjury, drunkenness,\ndebauchery, and ail the villainous in\nfluences that hell could inspire or wick\ned men employ to ruin him and rivet the\nchains of oppression on their helpless\nnooks. He stands for the people and the\npeople stand with him. This is the se\ncret of his popularity. To some "his\nwonderful popularity” is a mystery hard\nto solve. “What makes the lamb love\nMary so? Oh, Mary loves the lamb,\nyou know.” Just as much mystery in\nthis as the other. He has imperfections.\nHe does some things he ought not. He\nsavs some things he should not say, but\nwhen the people think oi the injustice\nhe has suffered, of the lies that have\nbeen told on him, the abuse that has\nbeen heaped upon him, they wonder that\nhe does not say and do worse things.\nThose who are supporting him only\ndesire that the people shall be heard\nfrom in an honest election, and that\ntheir decision shall be respected. I his is\nhonest; this is right. We believe that\nthere are some opposed to him who de\nsire this as much as we, but if there is\nany truth at all in much we hear, there\nare many who are determined that lie\nshall be defeated by any means, foul or\nfair. To such we would say, “Stop, poor\nsinner, stop and think before you fur\nther go.” In God’s name, let ns do\nright.

These two\nspecial trains carried 258 passengers and\nthe fare paid by these passengers was\njust $2lO short of being enough to pay\nthe railroad for running the trains, with\nall the barbecue ad infmitesimnm does\nnot seem to have been such a drawing\ncard after all. From all reports there\nwas not so large a crowd in Charleston\nthat day, despite the wide publicity,\nspecial rates, ball game, barbecue and\nso forth, as was there to greet Varda\nman, the man who needs no other at\ntract ion.—Greenwood Enterprise.\n* * •\nLook out for ten thousand more lies\non Vardaman during the last few days\nof the campaign. The oppositon ap\npreciates the fact that if something is\nnot done that he will be elected by a\ngreat many thousand over the “twins.”\nKeep your\'flint picked and your powder\ndry.\n* * *\nTell your neighbor about the cam\npaign and post him concerning the tricks\nand schemes to defeat ardaman.\n♦ * •\nSee that you are properly registered\nand go to the polls and vote.\n♦ ♦ *\nSeveral counties promise to give Var\ndaman more than 1,000 majority in\nAugust, and there is a friendly spirit of\nrivalry as to which will be the banner\ncounty. Pontotoc won four years ago\nwith a majority of 1,069, but it is confi\ndently asserted by several that this fig\nure will not win- the distinction this\nyear. South Mississippi is determined\nto have it this time.\n♦ * •\nRemember the date for the first pri\nmary election, August Ist, and it comes\nok Tuesday,\nCondensed Paragraphs.\nOnly a short time now until the cam\npaign of 1911 will have passed into his\ntory. Gov. Vardanian\'s friends are sit\nting steadily in the boat and allowing\nthe opposition to do all of the rocking.\nThere have been few changes of any\nkind during the past few months, Var\nduman receiving the bulk of what has\nbeen gained, ll is incumbent upon his\nfriends to keep their flints picked and\nthe powder dry until the result is offi\ncially announced. Be certain that you\nare registered. In a few days the elec\ntion commissioners will purge the poll\nbooks. Investigate after this work has\nbeen performed and be sure that your\nname is still on the book. This is\nespecially important in view of informa\ntion that comes to headquarters con\ncerning an effort to disqualify voters in\nlarge numbers. Put in a little time be\nfore hand inducing your friends to go to\nthe polls and vote. Have two good men\nto watch the poll and count for Varda\nnian as authorized by law. One to take\nthe place of the other if he must be\naway for a time. Stay with the count\nuntil it is finished and get it right, then\ntelegraph to headquarters at Jackson.\nAll of these matters are of the utmost\nimportance. Do this, and there need be\nno fear of the general result.\n* * * ♦\nThe Yazoo Sentinel sounds a word of\nwarning concerning the proposition to al\nlow a few illegal ballots to be cast in a\nnumber of the strongest Vardanian coun\nties and to contest the county in the\nstrength of this illegal voting. A con\ntest of this character would finally come\nbefore the State Executive Committee,\nwhich is anti-Vardanian. It is suggested\nthat in this event the counties would\nbe thrown out for the purpose of de\nfeating the will of the people again as\nit was in the “caucus” of last year. It\nis not believed that such high-handed ac\ntion will bo attempted, but the people\nare again warned to be on their guard\nfor schemes of all kinds. The election\nis won and the opposition must realize\nit. So it is the duty of every friend of\ngood government to go to the polls, stay\nthere and see that the election is car 1\nvied out in a lawful and proper manenr.\nThat is all that the friends of Varda\nnian ask for, and to that they are en\ntitled.\n• * •\nAnd we don\'t hear much nowadays of\nthe old cry that “the people are desert\ning Vardanian” and lining up with the\n“common-causers.” It has been started\nby the newspapers behind the “caucus”\nbunch, but dies a born in\'. The truth of\nthe matter is, Vardanian is gaining votes\nday by day. The campaign of abues\nand vilification being waged against him\nby the “common-causers,” is bringing to\nhis support an element of people who\nhave been undecided, but resent unfair\ntactics in anything. Call to mind the\nconverts in your own neighborhood made\nin this way and judge the whole state\nfrom what you know personally to be\na fact in your section.\n* * *\nA man from Jackson who claims he\nis soliciting subscribers for the Jackson\nDaily News, was in McCorab Monday,\nand in the course of a conversation with\none of our Main street merchants made\nthe following significant statements:\n“IF THE NEGROES COULD ONLY\nVOTE WE WOULD SURELY DEFEAT\nVARDAMAN,” In reply to the question\nas to who the News is supporting he\nstated it was supporting EITHER\nPERCY OR ALEXANDER, but is\n“JUST FIGHTING TO DEFEAT VAR\nDAMAN.”\nThe reader can form his own conclu\nsions from the above. —McComb City\nEnterprise.\n• *\nOnly a few days since the public press\n(unfavorable to Vardanian) dispatches\nstated that Alexander spoke to 100 at\nTunica, Percy to from 500 to 700 in\nMadison county and Vardanian to 4,000\nat Pittsboro in Calhoun county. Varda\nnian had 5,000 to 6,000 at Tupelo, 6,000\nto 7,000 at Pontotoc, and crowds of\nequal enthusiasm, if not quite so large\nin numbers, all over North Mississippi.\nThe campaign of abuse against him is\nbringing to his stndard many votes that\nhe would not receive otherwise.\n# *\nA lie loaded with a half truth is much\nmore dangerous than a lie out of the\nwhole cloth. It takes the weaving of\nthe golden strand in the fabrication\nto give it the semblance of facts. With\nsuch a lie the devil proposed a tempta\ntion ostensibly justified by Scriptural\nquotation, but received a rebuke like\nunto a lightning flash from the Savior.\nWith such sugar-coated lies the political\nenemies of ex-Gov. Vardaman have tried\nto destroy him ever since the death of\nthe late lamented Anse McLaurin, recog\nnizing that Vardaman was the then\nlogical man in Mississippi to wear the\nsenatorial toga. —Green County Herald\n♦ ♦ ♦\nThe suggestion that the opposition tc\nVardaman would arrange for several men\nat each precinct to talk for Vardaman\nuntil a week or so before the election\nand then make a grand stand play of\ndeserting him for the purpose of carry\ning the voters off their feet, may not\nhave been contemplated, and if it had,\nthe publicity given the proposition would\nhave spoiled the effect. M hen the peo\nple see a man parading around lambast\ning Vardaman and trying to get tb\nvoters to cast their ballots against him,\nthey know pretty well the cause that\nis behind him.\n♦ * *\nAlexander stuck pretty close to his\nsubject here Tuesday —he referred to\nVardaman seventy-five times. He called\nVardaman\'s name thirty-six times and\nPercy\'s once. —Hickory Reporter-Index.\n• ♦ ♦\nA free ballot and a fair count is all\nthat Vardaman\'s friends desire and de\nmand.

D.’s. psoriasis, and\nothers leprosy, commencing on my\nscalp; and in spite of all I could do,\nwith the help of the most skilful doc\ntors, it slowly but surely extended un\ntil a year ago this winter it covered\nmy entire person in the form of dry\nscales. For the last three years I have\nbeen unable to do any labor, and\nBuffering intensely all the time. Every\nmorning there would be nearly a dust\npanful of scales taken from the sheet\non my bed, some of them half as large\nas the envelope containing this letter.\nIn the latter part of winter my skin\ncommenced cracking open. I tried\neverything, almost, that could be\nthought of, without any relief. The\n12th of June 1 started West, in hopes\nI could reach the Hot Springs. I\nreached Detroit and was so low I\nthought I should have to go to the\nhospital, but finally got as far as Lan\nsing, Mich., where I had a sister liv\ning. One Dr. treated me about\ntwo weeks, but did me no good. All\nthought I had but a short time to live.\nI earnestly prayed to die. Cracked\nthrough the skin all oven my back,\nacross my ribs, arms, hands, limbs;\nfeet badly swollen; toe-nails came off;\nfinger-nails dead and hard as a bone;\nhair dead, dry and lifeless as old\nstraw. O my God! how I did suffer.\n“My sister wouldn\'t give up; said,\n‘We will try Cuticura.’ Some was ap\nplied to one hand and arm. Eureka!\nthere was relief; stopped the terrible\nburning sensation from the word go.\nThey immediately got Cuticura Re\nsolvent, Ointment and Soap. I com\nmenced by taking Cuticura Resolvent\nthree times a day after meals; had a\nbath once a day, water about blood\nheat; used Cuticura Soap freely; ap\nplied Cuticura Ointment morning and\nevening. Result: returned to my\nhome in just six weeks from the time\nI left, and my skin as smooth as this\nsheet of paper. E, Carpenter,\nHenderson, N. Y.’V\nThe above remarkable testimonial\nwas written January 19, 1880, and is\nrepublished because of the perman\nency of the cure. Under date of April\n22, 1910, Mr. Carpenter wrote from his\npresent home, 610 Walnut St. So.,\nLansing, Mich.: “I have never suf\nfered a return of the psoriasis and al\nthough many years have passed 1 have\nnot forgotten the terrible suffering I\nendured before using the Cuticura\nRemedies.”\nRest for Tuberculosis Patients.\nDr. Joseph H. Pratt of Boston, who\nwas the founder of the first tuberculo\nsis class in the United States in the\nEmmanuel church in Boston, claims\nthat in the treatment of tuberculosis\nabsolute rest, often in bed, must be\nextended over a period of months, be\nfore the consumptive should take any\nexercise. He says: “Prolonged rest\nin bed out of doors yields better re\nsults than any other method of treat\ning pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients\nwill have a better appetite, and take\nmore food without discomfort and gain\nweight and strength faster than pa\ntients with active disease who are\nallowed to exercise. Complications\nare much less frequent. When used\nin the incipient stage recovery is\nmore rapid and surer.”\nJust Then the Tea Bell Rang.\nOne of the best repartees ever\ncredited to a habitual maker of happy\nphrases was that made by the beloved\n“Autocrat of the Breakfast Table ”on\na certain social occasion.\nGoing to dine with a Boston neigh\nbor, Mr. Holmes was met by her wdth\nan apology;\n“T could not get another man.

McCartney of St.\nJohn, N. 8., the other day, “call every\nbody from the maritime provinces\n‘bluenoses.’ That’s not It at all. It’s\nonly the Nova Scotians that we call\nso. And it’s not because the people\nthere have blue noses, either.\n“I have met people here who really\nthought that folks down east were so\ncalled because their noses were al\nways blue on account of the cold, raw\nclimate they suppose prevails there.\n“The fact is, the term ‘bluenoses’\nwas first given to the inhabitants of\nthe Cornwallis valley, who were the\noriginal raisers of a potato called the\n‘bluenose,’ from its bluish skin. This\npotato was shipped to the states in\nlarge quantities, and the name of the\npotato became the name of the peo\nple who raised it.”\nHAVE YOU TRIED PAXTINE\nThe Great Toilet Germicide?\nYou don’t have to pay BOc or SI.OO\na pint for listerian antiseptics or per\noxide.

Lee of Columbia\nuniversity, New York, writing on the\nsubject, “The Physiology of Rest and\nExercise,’’ in the Journal of the Out\ndoor Life for June, shows by experi\nments on dissected frogs the way in\nwhich exercise tires the muscles and,\nin fact, all the organs of the body. He\nsays, “There is no known antidote\nto fatigue, unless it be rest, with all\nthat rest implies. Sleep allows the\nreparative processes of rest to be\nperformed most quickly and complete\nly. A moderate degre of fatigue, or\neven a considerable deree, when not\ntoo often incurred, is not detrimental\nto a healthy body and is even to be\nadvised. The healthy body is pro\nvided with great recuperative pow\ners, and does not rapidly succumb to\nexcessive demands on its en\nergy. But it should be allowed the\nproper condition for recuperation, and\nthat condition is adequate rest. There\nis danger when the fatigue of one\nday’s labor is not eliminated before\nthe next day’s work is begun. The ef\nfect may be cumulative, the tissues\nmay be in a continued state of depres\nsion, and the end may be disastrous.”\nChurch and State.\n“If our government is to be endur\ning it must rest on principles of jus\ntice, truth and righteousness, sanc\ntioned by recognition of a supreme\nbeing whose superintending provi\ndence watches over the affairs of na\ntions and of men. There is no offi\ncial union of church and state in this\ncountry, but there is no antagonism\nbetween the civil and religious au\nthorities. Church and state move on\nparallel lines. The state holds over\nthe spiritual rulers the regis of its\nprotection without interfering with\nrights of conscience. The church helps\nenforce civil laws by moral and re\nligious sanctions.

U\nTHE PUBLIC FORUM.\n‘Tax.f.yw” Writes • Ttmtly Cowaktlim\nm Bead Imm iri lri Repair*.\nEditor Sea Coast Echo:—\nHere we are, in one of the nicest spots\nin the South for an up-to-date summer\nresort, letting opportunities slip by and\ncausing loss and damage that will be\nthe harder to repair the longer it is de\nlayed. Not only is our front road gone,\nbut our back streets are in a worse con\ndition than they have been in ten years.\nIt seems as though our city fathers\nhave gone to sleep. Something ought\nto be done. There seems to be nothing\ndoing in regard to putting the roads in\nshape. On account of their condition,\nthis year is going to be one of the dull\nest seasons experienced in some time,\nand if our people want to cater to the\nsummer visitore (which is our greatest\nsource of income), we will have to give\nthem good driveways, and the better\nthey are the more attractive it will make\nour town. There is no question about\nthat, as it has been fully demonstrated\nthe last two years. There has been\nless than half the number of vehicles\nhere the last two seasons than there\nwere in former years when we had the\ngood roads. The blacksmiths can give\nyou an idea of the falling off in their\ntrade the last two years. Now, they tell\nyou, as soon as we get the bond money\nthe roads will be fixed. Well, that is\nall right for the back roads, for they\ncertainly need it; bnt I think that a\ngreat many will agree with me in stat\ning that it is throwing the people’s\nmoney away to put it on the front and\nfix the driveway as it should be, unless\nthe latter is protected with the proper\nkind of a breakwater. 1 There is hardly\nany question about it. lam not speak\ning about or referring to the break\nwater which has been built by the prop\nperty owners between Main street and\nCarroll avenue, but to that part of the\nfront of the city from Main street to the\nwestern boundary line of the city limits.\nThen the question comes up as to who\nis going to build the breakwaters in\nfront of their property. This is the\nserious question, and it will have to be\ndecided sooner or later. The sooner it\nis done the cheaper and better it will\nbe for Bay St. Louis as a whole. There\nwill be some property holders on the\nfront who will build the breakwater,\nthere will be others that cannot afford\nit; and again there will be others that\ncan afford it, but, for one reason or an\nother, will not do it. Well, what is the\ncity to do about it ? It is useless to\nbuild a roadway without protection—\nfor the next storm to come along and\ntake it away again. The issue seems\nto be, who is going to build the break\nwater ? The city fathers say they have\nno right to build a breakwater on per-\nsonai property. Well, that may be\ntrue. The Mayor says if the property\nholders will give the city the frontage\nand allow it to charge the people for\nthe right to put up their wharves, then\nthe city will build the breakwater, I\nbelieve there would not be many to do\nanything so foolish as that; but I do\nthink that the property holders on the\nfront would daed over to the city enough\nland along the beach to build the break\nwater, say, six feet, and then let the\ncity build a uniform breakwater and\nroadway along the whole front. There\nare several ways in which it could be\ndone. For instance, the coast could\nbe proportioned between the property\nholders and the city, the latter to issue\nbonds to cover costs.\nOr why could it not be worked like\nthe paving in Gulfport ?—the city to pay\ntwo-thirds and the property holders on\nthe front paying one-third of the ex\npense of the wall. The city to pay for\nthe total cost, giving the property own\ners two and three years time to pay\ntheir one-third. The Bay needs a first\nclass driveway, and every dollar\non it will be returned two-fold to the\nproperty owners on the front, the busi\nness men, the property owners in the\nback streets, and everybody, no matter\nin what business or capacity they are\nengaged, will be benefited alike. You\nwill hear some of the property holders\non the back streets say: “We will not\nhelp to build a road and breakwater on\nthe front to increase the value of the\nproperty thereon; it don’t help us\nany.” My answer to this is, speaking\nas a property holder on the front as\nwell as on the back streets, a beautiful\ndnveway on the front does me no more\ngood than it does to the man that owns\nproperty on the back streets, as it en\nhances the value of the property and\nincreases the taxes, and as the city has\nto maintain a roadway, this would pro\ntect the property from erosion to a great\nextent. But as a business proposition\nit is almost a necessity that there be a\nperfect driveway along our front, and\nthe soener the people of the Bay realize\nthis the sooner will the town amount to\nsomething as a summer resort. We\nmust cater to the visitors, as our bread\nand butter depend upon it. Ask your\nselves why it is that the property hold\ners had to sacrifice their property this\nsummer, some, to my knowledge, rent\ning their houses for as low as 50 per\ncent, less than in former years. Where\nare all of the automobiles and horses\nand buggies we used to see in the even\nings and on Sundays on our streets ?\nThey all mean more money for us.\nLook at our hotels. They are not\ncrowded. They should be. It certainly\nhas been hot enough in the city. It is\nthe bad roads that are driving them\naway, and the people are going to the\nother towns, where the roads are kept\nin good condition. What we want is a\ndriveway that cannot be surpassed on\nthe coast; that will be well protected\nfrom tiie storms. Then Bay St. Louis\nwill be among the best resorts in the\ncountry. The greatest trouble with our\nback streets is that they are not prop\nerly graded, so that the water can run\noff the sides ol the roads, instead of,\nas is now the case, running in the cen\nter of the street and washing the shells\naway, leaving a galley in its wake.\nThe same thing can be said of all the\ngrades in the city, and, as a conse\nquence, it becomes necessary, after\nevery rain, to put a fresh layer of shells\non the grades. Why cannot we have\ngraded roads? It costs no more to\nround them off than to make a flat road\nwith the water standing in the center,\nI producing holes. Main street is a good\nexample of a graded road where the\nwater can drain off. I believe there has\nbeen less expense in keeping this street,\nbetween Toulme street and Nicaise ave\nnue, in condition than any other in\ntown.\nGentlemen, this question of streets is\na serious one, the solving of which is\nthe only salvation of the Bay, and must\nnot be overlooked.\nWe must have a front drive, and it\nwill have to be protected. It will most\nassuredly be up to the city to protect\nits front road. Asa large property\nowner and, of course, a large tax payer,\nI am heart and soul in favor of the city\ntaking hold of this breakwater proposi\ntion by issuing bonds and putting in a\nuniform breakwater. The property\nholders could pay off these bonds with\nout working any hardship, and every\ndollar would come back twofold.\nWake up, you old city fathers, and do\nsomething; even the snail is too fast for\nyou.

C. GRAY, CANDIDATE\nFOR CIRCUIT AND CHANCERY\nCOURT CLERK.\nTo the Voters of Hancock County;—\nHaving announced myself some few\nmonths ago as a candidate for the office\nof Chancery and Circuit Clerk for Han\ncock County, to succeed the present in\ncumbent, who has held the office for\nthirty-four consecutive years, more or\nless, a period over the average term of\nman’s life, X wish to address this open\nletter to you as a fitting final campaign\ndocument. I will ask you to read; then\nreflect.\nThe encouragement I have hereto\nfore received is, to say the least, most\nencouraging, and I feel justified in an\nticipating my election. My friends\nhave been loyal to me at every juncture\nof this race, and I would be derelict in\nmy common duty were I to fail to ex\npress sentiments of appreciation and\ngratefulness. Truly it can be said\nwords are inadequate; but my friends\nknow me well and are fully aware that\nlam sincere in my declarations. lam\nthankful to them not only for their un\nswerving support, but for their solici\ntation which shaped and determined\nmy intention to become a candidate.\nI pitched my campaign on a high and\nactive plane—just as I purpose running\nthe office, when elected, in a clean and\nbusiness-like way—and no one can im\npugn the honesty and candor of my\nmethod and manner. In fact, I have\nbeen told that, at times, I was not po\nlitic enough, but I despise fawning, and\nwould rather not receive the honor if I\nhad to curry and court favor and spend\nmoney in the endeavor to succeed. I\nam unlike the professional politician\nwho pays other people’s poll taxes be\nfore February Ist, and thus buys votes,\nwhich is, as is well known, contrary to\nlaw. If lamto be your county clerk, I\nwant it by means “fair and square’’,\nand I might add that I do not wish it for\nlife tenure. The man who has fed at\nthe public crib and held office with your\nindulgence and kind forbearance for\nnearly two score years must laugh in\nutter mockery at the indifference of the\nvoter, and, in his own cunning and low\nstrata of intelligence, purblind through\negotism born of assininity, must revel\nin his own domain of reasoning. This\nperpetual holding of office is nauseating\nto common decency and smells to\nheaven. I would certainly not think of\nobtruding myself upon the good graces\nof the voters and of imposing upon their\ngoodness; for then I would feel that it\nwere better not to elect our public ser\nvants in future, but merely give them\nthe office for life and make succession\nhereditary, the same as the kingdoms\nof the old country.\nA condition akin to this exists in\nHancock county today, and the tentacles\nof the monster of Greed, Selfishness,\nand perpetuity of office-holding are so\nentwined and clutched about our throats\nas to almost hold us at will, without\nmercy or even commisseration. It is\ncustomary and* ci/rect to reward a faith\nful servant, and a few terms of the office\nas a gift from the people is fitting and\nis a recognition commensurate with the\nservices, but, fellow-voters, let us be\nsane and reasonable. Don’t you hon\n| estly think that the obligation is on the\nother side? In this particular instance\nthe people of Bay St. Louis and Han\ncock county and their grown children\nhave permitted a most unusual and un\nparalleled condition to obtain, and the\nopportunity is now knocking at their\ndoor to strike for themselves. “Oppor\ntunity” knocks only once, and my can\ndidacy at this time is beckoning you to\nembrace it.\n“Master of human destinies am I;\nFame, Love and Fortune on my footsteps await;\nCities and fields I walk; I penetrate\nDeserts and seas remote, and passing by\nHovel and mart and palace, soon or late,\nI knock, unbidden, once at every gate.\nIf sleeping, wake; If feasting, rise before\nI turn away; it is the hour of Fate.\n\\nd they who follow me reach every state\nMortals desire, and conquer every foe\nSave Death; but those who doubt or hesitate.\nCondemned to Failure, Penury and Woe,\nSeek me In vain and uselessly implore;\nnot and return no more."\nOn the eve of the election, this is the\nhour of Fate. Turn not away. Do not\ndoubt. Do not hesitate.\nFellow Citizens and Patriots of Han\ncock County, you have the sovereign\npower of the ballot in your hand, the\nmost potent and sacred privilege given\nin the hands of man. When you go to\nthe polls let your Ballot, as you mark it\nwith an “X” opposite the name you\nwish to vote for county clerk, be your\nDeclaration of Independence; let it be\nas a priceless and imperishable heritage\nyou are handing down to your children\nand their children, in fact, to the pos\nterity of Hancock County. The Decla\nration of Independence! What a sesame\nfor a long vista of thought! Our fore\nfathers fought and died for the Magna\nCharts, and bow the sands were red\ndened and steeped in human blood!\nCourage was not lacking in those days, j\nWe are the descendants of those heroes.\nThe same courageous spirit abides in\nour hearts today. We American peo\nple are a liberty-loving people. Are\nwe today less courageous I Have we\nless spirit ? Are we not made of the\nsame stuff of moral courage as our fore\nfathers ? Then let our ballot, I say, on\nAugust Ist, be your and my Declara\ntion of Independence.\nConditions which obtain today are\nyour fault and my fault as well—the\nfault of the people, the voters. By the\nright of our ballot, a vested right given\nby the Constitution of the United\nStates, let us cast our ballot so as to re\nvoke this condition of sordid greed, sel\nfishness and favoritism for a few at the\nexpense of the many, and let us cast\noff this thraldom and the yoke of thirty\nfour years of ONE MAN POWER IN\nTI|E ONE OFFICE.\nPowerful Rome, mighty Rome, with\nher servile minions, her “scarred and\nveteran legions”, fell, and history is\nnot without numerous parallels which\nlack of space will not permit of enumer\nation here. Napoleon met his Water\nloo, and here at home Cornwallis his\nWashington, These and others were\nmighty conditions, impregnable and\nimpenetrable. In fact, these with oth\ners were men who held sway with ap\nparently undying hand, but the Tomb\nstones of Time now mark it all. Does\nnot history repeat itself ? Are not the\nsigns of the times portentous ? Let us\ncome down to history of today. Did not\nthe mighty and imperious Roosevelt\nlose New York, his home State, last fall,\nand the power of the Republicans die\na death like the triumvirate great?\nAfter August Ist let Caesar’s servile\nminions mock the lion thus laid low.\nConditions and time change. Time\nand tide wait for no man, and the pre\ncess of elimination, like Tennyson’s\nbrook, goes on and on forever. The\ncurrent is swift, the ebb is fast, and,\nlike the fallen gladiator who has stood\nunvanquished in the arena for over 30\nyears, the enemy dies. “Help me, Cas\nsius, or I sink!” BUT, ALAS! TOO\nLATE.\n“I am dying, Egypt, dying!\nEbbs the crimson life-tide fast,\nAnd the dark Plutonian shadows\nGather in the evening blast.”\nBefore closing, a word personal might\nnot be amiss. Nearly every man, wo\nman and child in Hancock county knows\nC. C. Gray. My life has been an open\nbook. We are all human and have our\nfrailties more or less, but, applying\nthings to political and general account\nI wish to say that:\nI have never stood on the street cor\nners night after night with a negro in\nsocial or political conversation.\nI have never sat in a summer house\nenjoying the evening’s sea zephyrs with\na negro in conversation in that status of\nsocial quality.\nI have never endorsed, either by peti\ntion or private letter, a negro applicant\nfor post office or other Federal position,\nover the applications of others of my\nwhite fellow-citizens.\nWhile it is charged that others have\ndone so, I have never signed a bond for\na negro postmaster in a white man’s\ntown. If I had I would move away to\noblivion with my head hung in abject\nshame.\nI have announced my candidacy for\nCircuit and Chancery Court Clerk in the\nlocal press to the public, subject to the\naction of the Democratic white primary.\nI am a Southerner and a white Demo\ncrat. My candidacy is a business prop\nosition and to serve my people—not a\njoke, as someone, reckoning without\nhis host, recently said, the thought\nbeing father to the wish. lam running\nfor myself and to serve the people, and\nI wish to say that I am an enemy to the\ncondition which obtains in Hancock\ncounty, and I do think, with the best\nthought of the county, that the time for\na change is opportune and will bring\nsuccess. In closing, I wish to thank\none and all, and to dedicate the follow\ning lines of Cardinal Wolsey’s lament,\n“Farewell,” to the one my election will\nrelegate to the rear;\n‘ Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness.\nThis Is the state of man; today he puts forth\nThe tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms,\n1 And bears his honors thick upon him.\nThe third day comes a frost, a killing frost;\nAnd when he thinks—good, easy man, full surely\nHis greatness Is ripening—nips hie root,\nAnd then he falls, as 1 do. I have ventured,\nLike little wanton boys tuat swim on bladders,\nThese many summers in a sea of glory;\nBut far beyond my depth; my high-blown pride\nAT LENGTH BROKE UNDER ME; AND\nNOW HAS LEFT ME\nWEARY AND OLD WITH SERVICE, TO THE\nMERCY\nOF A RUDE STREAM THAT MUST FOR\nEVER HIDE ME.\nVain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;\n1 feel my heart now opened. 0, how wretched\nIs that poor man that hangs on princes’ favors!\nThere are, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\nMore pangs and fears than wars or women have;\nAND, WHEN HE FALLS, HE FALLS LIKE\nLUCIFER.\nNEVER TO HOPE AGAIN.”\nReaders of this “open” letter, I thank\nyou.\nSincerely,\nC.
