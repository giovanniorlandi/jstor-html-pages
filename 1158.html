        <pre>['Book Reviews\nThe Transnational Villagers. By Peggy Levitt. Berkeley, CA: University\nof California Press, 2001.\nFragmented Ties: Salvadoran Immigrant Networks in America. By Cecilia\nMenjı́var. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2000.\nPhilip Kasinitz\nDepartment of Sociology, City University of New York, Graduate Center\nThese books have a good deal in common, beyond the not incidental fact\nthat they share the same publisher. Both are studies of Latin American\nimmigrants making their way in the United States and both do a fabulous\njob of giving voice to people whose lives are complex and multifaceted.\nIn the best tradition of earlier community studies, they tell stories that\nare simultaneously global and highly local. They manage to represent the\nspecificity of particular communities while also showing how ordinary\npeople’s daily lives are buffeted by forces that reshape entire societies.\nBoth are about people, Dominicans and Salvadorans, who don’t fit neatly\ninto traditional North American ways of thinking about race and ethnicity\nand thus they underline the ways racial/ethnic categories are being\nrenegotiated in an increasingly diverse United States. Both are first books\nby scholars who, while drawing on older community studies traditions, are\nalso well versed in contemporary social theory. While neither is specifically\nframed as a “feminist ethnography,” both are greatly enriched by attention\nto the experiences of women. Finally, both tend to see immigrant\ncommunities less as corporate units than as collections of social networks\nthat span international borders. Here, however, they differ, at least in\nemphasis. In The Transnational Villagers, Levitt sees the maintenance of\ncommunal ties across borders as blurring, if not obliterating, the distinction\nbetween home and host societies. The Dominican immigrants in her\nstudy manage to participate effectively in the social, economic, and political\nlives of two countries—or, perhaps, in a single community that spans\ntwo nation states. This feat is neither effortless or cost free, but it is, she\nargues, a viable, long-term survival strategy that is increasingly common\nin many parts of the world. By contrast, Menjı́var focuses on the limits\nand hidden costs of communal solidarity, particularly for women. For her,\nethnic networks of obligation help but also limit the life chances of individuals\nin a community where friends and relatives often have little to share.\nLevitt’s study is both a ground-breaking empirical work on Dominican\nmigration and a theoretical contribution to the growing “transna-\ntional perspective” on international migration. This perspective gained\nCity & Community 1:2 June 2002\nC© American Sociological Association, 1307 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20005-4701\n245\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\npopularity among anthropologists in the early 1980s and is increasingly\ninfluential among sociologists of migration. Following her informants,\nLevitt simultaneously conducted fieldwork in the town of Miraflores\non the southern coast of the Dominican Republic, and in the Jamaica\nPlain section of Boston, where about half of Mirafloreños reside at any\ngiven time. She proposes Miraflores as an example of a particular type of\ntransnational community that she terms the “transnational village.” The\nphrase, of course, is a deliberate oxymoron: Much as Gans once described\nresidents of Boston’s West End as being both “urban” and “villagers,”\nLevitt shows how a traditional, bounded, cooperative community can\nmaintain itself while its members are thousands of miles apart.\nIt does not do so by remaining static. Indeed, much of the book is\nabout how migration has changed Miraflores, where development has been\nprofoundly uneven. Forty percent of its households lack indoor toilets and\nmany rely on rain water for washing, yet almost every household has a\nVCR or a compact disk player and cheap international telephone service is\ntaken for granted. Transnational villages are places where migration has\nbecome so common and economic and social remittances have become\nso important, that they have reshaped the lives of even those people\nwho do not migrate. They are places where civic, political, and religious\norganizations routinely operate across borders. They are the sites where\nindividuals “embedded in a particular context” can come to image a “new\ncartography” in which they can try out new ideas. Because they are places\nin which migrants, returned migrants, and nonmigrants are increasingly\ndependent on each other, Levitt argues that they are likely to endure.\nIn Boston and Miraflores, Mirafloreños struggle to make “the values and\ntwo worlds fit” together coherently, as the migration experience leads\nthem to reconstruct the power relations between parents and children,\nbetween people of different races, and between men and women. Returning\nmigrants bring these changes back to Miraflores. As one 19-year-old\nwoman told Levitt: “I see the way couples act when they come back to\nvisit. The men have changed. The couples do things together. The man\ndoesn’t just leave his wife at home and go out to enjoy himself with his\nfriends instead of with his girl friend.. . . They make decisions together.\nWhen I start my own family, I want it to be like that” (p. 61). Ideas about\npolitical and, particularly, religious life change as well, with nonmigrant\nMirafloreños increasingly coming to share the migrants’ embarrassment\nat traditional folk practices and embracing more “officially sanctioned\nchurch based rituals” (p. 176). Yet Levitt insists this is not just a matter\nof Miraflores becoming more “American.” The two worlds are interconnected\nand changing in tandem.\nThis “transnational” emphasis is itself reminiscent of early 20thcentury\nviews. Randolph Bourne used the term “Trans-national” (al-\nbeit in a somewhat different way) and Thomas and Znaniecki’s book,\nwith its use of letters between Poland and Chicago, was called The Polish\nPeasant in Europe and America. Yet with the end of mass migration from\nEurope in the 1920s, immigration came to be seen as a “one-way” process.\n246\n', 'BOOK REVIEWS\nToday, Levitt argues the situation is qualitatively different: “Receiving\na letter every two weeks is not the same as being able to pick up the\nphone at any moment.. . . a closeness arises just from knowing you can\nbe in touch immediately. . . . It also gives the migrants the ability to be\ninvolved in the day-to-day decisions of the households they leave behind”\n(p. 23).\nRather than eroding over time, as the assimilation perspective would\npredict, Levitt argues that these ties of interdependence are actually\ngetting stronger. Daily life in Miraflores is increasingly dependent on\neconomic and social remittances from the United States. Increasingly\naware of themselves as “poor” and “nonwhite” in North American terms\n(an irony for many Mirafloreños who trace their ancestry to the Canary\nIslands and are particularly touchy about their status as “white” in\nDominican terms!), many Boston-based migrants have come to derive\nstatus and satisfaction from the important roles they play in politics and\neconomic development in Miraflores. Levitt does not romanticize these developments.\nShe finds little support for the idea that transnational migra-\ntion can be a form of resistance against global capital, or Homi Bhabha’s\nattractive but largely untested notion that transnationalism produces\nhybrid identities that “elude essentializing national identities” (p. 13).\nWhile she reports a few migrant rags-to-riches stories, for the most part\nthe village status structure has stayed intact. Those who benefited from\nmigration were usually somewhat better off to begin with. Most migrants\nand their families have seen their material lives improve slightly, but at\nthe cost of increased dependence on remittances, forcing more migration.\nAt times Levitt’s rejection of the assimilation perspective leads her to\nignore possible counter evidence. Her focus on relations within the community\nobscures other connections. We learn little about what sort of re-\nlationships Dominican-Bostonians are forming with non-Dominicans, or\neven non-Mirafloreños, people they must be meeting on the job, in school,\nin the neighborhood. We rarely hear about deviant cases. What about\nthose Mirafloreños who lose touch with the community? How do they\ndiffer from their more embedded neighbors? Still, Levitt makes a compelling\ncase for the importance of a new type of community. In her con-\ncluding section she also takes up the all-important comparative question\nof how “her” village compares with others and in a short but very interesting\ncoda she looks at other kinds of transnational communities and begins\nto develop typology of different sorts of transnational relationships. This\nis an important step, one that promises fruitful theory building.\nAn interesting comparative case is the Salvadoran migrants of the\nMission District of San Francisco, whose story Cecilia Menjı́var tells movingly\nin Fragmented Ties. If Transnational Villagers describes a case in\nwhich community bonds seem likely to endure, Fragmented Ties describes\none in which they seem likely to be lost. Yet Menjı́var’s informants are far\nfrom a model of happy assimilation. They are, by and large, at least as\npoor as Levitt’s informants and considerably more isolated, not just from\nU.S. society, but often from each other.\n247\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\nSome of the differences start with the different ways they arrive in\nthe United States. Both El Salvador and the Dominican Republic have\nlong histories of neo-colonial ties to the United States. Yet compared to\nneighboring countries, both sent few migrants to the United States until a\ncrisis propelled large numbers north. In the Dominican case, this was the\npolitical and economic instability following the U.S. military intervention\nin 1965; in the Salvadoran case, it was the bloody civil war of the 1970s and\n1980s. While some Dominicans begin their trek to the United States with\na dangerous, clandestine boat trip to Puerto Rico, most simply get on a\nplane. With relatives in the United States and a relatively stable, if often\ncorrupt, local government, most of Levitt’s informants were able to obtain\nlegal tourist, student, or business visas (which they then over-stayed). A\nfew hours after leaving the Dominican Republic they sat in their relatives’\nliving rooms in Jamaica Plain. By contrast, many of Menjı́var’s informants\nfled El Salvador suddenly, sometimes in fear for their lives. They had no\ntime to obtain visas, which most could not have gotten in any case. They\ngenerally took a long, uncertain overland trip through Mexico, which, as\none informant notes: “may take a week, a month, or much longer.. . . No\none ever knows what may happen. . . . No one ever knows when the person\nmight arrive here” (p. 58).\nAlthough refugees in every meaningful sense save the legal one, few\nSalvadorans have any hope of political asylum. Their undocumented status\nweighs heavily on them: “No other issue among the people with whom\nI spoke,” Menjı́var writes, “was more important than having proper documentation.\nEvelyn S. told me that even though she spoke a bit of English,\nshe felt as if her hands were tied because she lacked documents” (p. 84).\nMany engage in elaborate schemes, including sham marriages, to legalize\ntheir status.\nBy contrast, although many of Levitt’s informants are also undocumented,\nthis fact plays a far less significant role in their lives. Most are\nable to obtain work and housing without legal status, and eventually\nmanage to obtain legal visas that allow them to travel back and forth.\nBy contrast, the lack of legal status prevented home-country visits and\ninhibited return migration among the Salvadorans. Even after the political\nsituation stabilized, most feared leaving the United States since there\nwas no guarantee they would ever be able to return.\nOnce in the United States, Salvadorans also report less co-ethnic support.\nMany complained that they “had no one to talk to” (p. 144). They\nsend remittances home, and many in El Salvador have become dependent\non these payments. Yet the ties Menjı́var describes are far more tenuous\nthan those Levitt observes. Some who received remittances in El Salvador\nare surprised that their U.S.-based relatives became less generous with\ntime and money once they had joined them in California. As in Miraflores,\ngender and intergenerational relations changed with migration. Women\ntake on greater public roles in the Salvadoran community in the United\nStates and, Menjı́var writes, “women’s participation in the public sphere\nallows them to establish networks independent from those of men”\n248\n', 'BOOK REVIEWS\n(p. 192). However, Menjı́var also notes how traditional gender norms limit\nwomen’s ability to seek help from Salvadoran men other than close relatives.\nIn some cases this leads them to rely on ties not only to other\nwomen, but also to non-Salvadorans, for assistance.\nWhile the theoretical backdrop to Levitt’s work is transnationalism,\nMenjı́var engages social network analysis. Contrary to much of this literature,\nhowever, she argues that ethnic networks play a limited role in\nthe lives of her informants. She speculates that this may be partially explained\nby premigration characteristics. Twelve years of fratricidal civil\nwar no doubt eroded people’s capacity for bonding and trust. I suspect\nthere are also some idiosyncracies in her Tenderloin sample—surely the\nprominent role Salvadorans now play in Los Angeles labor organizing\nis evidence that, on the whole, the group has not lost the capacity for\ncollective action. Yet Menjı́var argues convincingly that the largest obstacle\nto effective social networks is poverty. In the end, social capital is\nno substitute for more tangible resources. Networks that tie poor people\nonly to other poor people can be as much a hindrance as a benefit, and\nunder such conditions many will avoid incurring obligations of mutual\nassistance. This importantly corrects the current popular wisdom, not\nonly for the study of immigrants, but for the study of poor communities\nin general. Indeed, after reading Fragmented Ties, one cannot help but\nfeel that the notion of investing in social capital to fight poverty has been\nbadly oversold of late, both by social scientists and policymakers.\nHarlemworld: Doing Race and Class in Contemporary Black America.\nBy John L.

Taylor\nDepartment of Sociology, Occidental College\nGauging the significance of race in the United States is part of a longstanding\nquest in the tradition of American social science. Introducing class as\na variable to be weighed in studies of race relations merely increases the\nchallenge. This is the case especially when race and class are approached\nas the subject and focus of distinct subfields or as mutually exclusive\ncategories that hold separate knowledges to be unlocked and discovered.\nWhen it comes to studying black stratification, scholars often set out\narmed with their own methodological approaches, asking questions particular\nto one category or the other, and in the end producing a vast array\nof conclusions about how class has an impact on what race means. Viewed\nthrough the lens of different historical moments and seen in the light of\nshifting structural determinants, but always tied up in the virulent racism\n249\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\nthat continues to define American culture, the black experience tends to\nproduce scholarship that is surrounded by debate and, of necessity, a\ncombination of what has come before and its reworking.\nThe most informative studies to emerge from debates about black stratification\nhave been those that recognize an implicit link between the two\nvariables—race and class. In his classic 1899 study of the Negro elite in\nPhiladelphia, W. E. B. DuBois remarked:\nEvery group has its upper class; it may be numerically small and\nsocially of little weight, and yet its study is necessary to the comprehension\nof the whole . . . and as it is true that a nation must, to\nsome extent, be measured by its slums, it is also true that it can only\nbe understood and finally judged by its upper class.1\nCentral to the importance of DuBois’s study, with its concern for the\n“comprehension of the whole,” is its examination of class segmentation\nwithin a racially defined community. What Weberians would recognize as\nan approach sensitive to the exploration of differences within categories\ntoday would be identified as a hallmark of the postmodernist practice of\nmultiple ways of exploring difference.\nWhat DuBois and others working in the tradition of urban ethnography\nand race downplayed, however, are the links and connections between\nsegmented populations within the black system of stratification. From\nDuBois and E. Franklin Frazier right up to William Julius Wilson, who\nhas set the modern standard for these explorations of black stratification,\nwe tend to view sharp lines and class-based bifurcations in the black world\nas a matter of fact.\nHarlemworld and Black Picket Fences are recent books by a cultural anthropologist\nand a sociologist that take on such longstanding issues and,\nat the same time, weigh in on the latest debates on race and class. These\ntwo books are squarely situated in the tradition of the black community\nstudy, and at the same time they are also both at the cutting edge of theories\nand methods brought to bear on such matters. What these two works\nhave in common are the importance they give to the role of place and\ngeography in understanding black identity, the ways they subtly capture\nthe existence of bridges and links between “haves” and “have-nots” in\nthe black community, and, finally, a curiosity about the cross-class, racebased\nintimacies of everyday life for black Americans that develop out\nof their own positionalities as neither detached nor dispassionate middleclass\nAfrican-American scholars.\n“DOING” RACE AND CLASS\nFrom the outset, John L. Jackson makes clear that his concern is with\n“performative understandings of racial difference.” What he means by\nthis is that “many African Americans have decidedly performative notions\nof social identity. Socially meaningful identifications are partially\nderived from observable behaviors, practices, and social performances.”\n250\n', 'BOOK REVIEWS\nJackson claims that he offers this approach as a “potentially useful way\nof hewing anti-essentialist social identities” (p. 4). Some might find this\npostmodern notion of performance-based identity preposterous (Jackson\nhimself acknowledges that doing race matters little when it is done to you,\nraising the thorny issue of the very essentialist-based way that racism\nworks), but Jackson makes a strong case for tracing to the ground the\nways that, at a micro-level, history and structure do produce ways of\nacting.\nThrough Jackson’s eyes then, the reader is treated to an engrossing and\nup-close look at daily lives and personal intimacies that define those who\npeople the Harlemworld of his title. Harlemworld, a term the author has\n“sampled” from hip-hop, is a construct that points to Harlem’s “ability\nto extend and exceed its geographical borders” (p. 9). Perhaps because of\nits notoriety, and in part due to its atypical nature as a black community,\nHarlem is tough to disguise with the standard practice of assigning a\npseudonym to one’s particular ethnographic space as a stand-in for the\nuniversal.\nThe clever sampling of the term Harlemworld allows Jackson’s work\nto avoid this problem. It also helps set the stage for the innovative ways\nthat Jackson’s ethnographic informants are both constrained by and free\nof ties to a place-based set of specific meanings and social forces.\nThis is a book rich with the voices and stories of informants who Jackson\ncaptures through observations at work, home, and recreational spaces\nthroughout and beyond Harlem. Its departure from being a traditional\nethnography comes in those places, most notably a chapter on the cinema,\nbut also in his analysis of cyberspace, the telephone, and television, where\nJackson pinpoints the postmodernist sources of racial performance and\ncross-class connection for black actors.\n“WHITE PICKET FENCES”\nWhere the white picket fence is a symbol par excellence of the American\nDream, Mary Patillo-McCoy makes this topic her own with the simple\ncoloring of this symbol from white to black. Additionally, by situating\nprivilege and peril side by side in her book’s subtitle, Patillo-McCoy signals\nthat hers will not be a work that draws overly simplistic conclusions about\nblack mobility or the current status of the black middle class. While\nBlack Picket Fences does not deny the post-civil rights gains of upwardly\nmobile black Americans, it is also unflinching in its look at the instabilities\nand dangers that confront the middle class subjects of Groveland—the\npseudonym for the site of this study.\nBefore beginning her discussion of Groveland, Patillo-McCoy treats the\nreader to an excellent overview of scholarship on the black middle class.\nIn particular, her discussion of the definitional difficulties of determining\nwho belongs to this group unfolds alongside a thorough presentation of\nclassical and contemporary works on race and class. For readers new to\n251\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\nthe topic, this chapter alone is a worthy introduction to the contours of\nblack stratification.\nAfter two chapters that establish the history and present conditions\nof Groveland, Patillo-McCoy makes vivid use of rich ethnographic data\nconsisting of observation and interview material. What her data allows\nis a specific exploration of how Groveland’s middle-class residents make\nsense of and order their lives in neighborhoods that don’t exactly mirror\nthe “white picket fence” scenario where homeownership in suburbia is\nunderstood as a reward for success.\nThe types of peril that Patillo-McCoy alerts readers to—crime, drug\nuse, gangs, and limited opportunities that shape and undermine aspirations\nfor success—are not unfamiliar to those who live and work in the\nblack community. But this is where community studies like Black Picket\nFences and Harlemworld have the potential to be useful. They both yield\ninformation at a very particularistic level and inform knowledge about\nmore universal conditions, trends, and traits. Until scholars and observers\nof American society discover these truths and realities up close, social\ndiscourse about and policies pitched to ameliorating the race problems\nconfronting the supposed “haves” and the “have-nots” in the black world\nwill be incomplete. Mary Patillo-McCoy and John Jackson don’t treat this\nfact of black connectedness across class lines as an American dilemma\nwaiting to be resolved: They both see intersections of race, class, identity,\nand community as a fact of everyday life.\nNote\n1 DuBois, W. E. B. [1899] 1967. The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study. New York:\nSchoken Books.\nRed Lines, Black Spaces: The Politics of Race and Space in a Black MiddleClass\nSuburb. By Bruce D. Haynes. New Haven, NJ: Yale University\nPress, 2001. 180 pp. ISBN 0-300-08490-0.\nPaul Robinson\nDepartment of Geography, California State University–Northridge\nFor over 100 years (beginning with W. E. B. DuBois’s research on AfricanAmerican\nurban communities in the North), scholars have stressed the\nneed to better understand the diverse social and economic groups that\ntogether sustain urban black communities. These appeals, however, have\nbeen largely ignored, and instead effort has focused mostly on the poorest\nmembers of the black urban community. In Red Lines, Black Spaces,\nBruce Haynes presents a picture of “the other side” of black urban life,\nembodied by the Runyon Heights/Nepperhan community of Yonkers,\nNew York. Runyon Heights is a suburban community that has remained\noverwhelmingly African American and also solidly middle class since the\n1920s. Initially established by middle-class African-American escapees\nfrom Harlem, the community has continued to gain black population\n252\n', 'BOOK REVIEWS\nand upgrade its social status until the present. Haynes shows how the\nstable homeowners of the community have waged a long battle against\nredlining, school gerrymandering, attempts to locate public housing, and\nother forms of personal and institutional discrimination from the City of\nYonkers and from neighboring white communities.\nThe methodology adopted in Red Lines, Black Spaces includes archival\nresearch supplemented by interviews with community residents.This approach\nyields some interesting and valuable history concerning the in-\nteraction between African Americans and the European (largely Italian\nimmigrant) neighbors they shared the area with in the early 1900s. The\ndiscussion on the various myths behind the decision to sell homes to\n“Negroes” in the Runyon Heights/Nepperhan area offers a glimpse back\nthrough time into the complex racial and ethnic situations that accompanied\nlife in the New York region after the turn of the previous cen-\ntury. Haynes discusses how the influx of European immigrants and the\nprivilege of “whiteness” bestowed upon them allowed illiterate European\nimmigrants to enjoy the benefits of the booming free labor market to\ngain access to employment and housing that was denied to even the most\neducated African-American residents of Runyon Heights.\nThe response of the people of Runyon Heights/Nepperhan was to develop\nwhat Haynes terms hyperorganization. Residents tended to main-\ntain membership in one or more of numerous overlapping social organizations\nthat characterized Runyon Heights social life in the 1920s. Civic\nassociations such as the Westchester Junior League, Nepperhan Republican\nClub, Runyon Heights Democratic Club, the Uniques, the Four Hun-\ndreds, the Sewing Circle, the Royal Athletic League, and a host of other\ncivic organizations kept people connected to the broader black community,\nlocally in the Yonkers area, as well as within the broader New York\nCity and national black community.\nHaynes portrays how the black middle-class residents of this small isolated\ncommunity faced social complexities and ambiguities of race and\nclass. He indicates a clear need for further research into the nonpoor segments\nof the black urban milieu, and the adjustments they have had to\nmake to survive in the hostile climate of American urban spaces. Popular\nscholars have made the claim that as income increases, race becomes less\nand less significant in the lives of urban African Americans, as class effects\nincreasingly supplant racial effects. The evidence from Runyon Heights\nrebuts this line of thought. For the homeowners of Runyon Heights, race\nhas taken on a new salience as they confront hostility from the outside\nbecause of their shared blackness. Southern-born African Americans\nhave become bound together with West-Indian-born blacks as they work\ntogether to preserve the middle-class suburban ideals that they had\nmoved to Yonkers for in the first place. This cooperation was crystallized\nin shared black identity. As stated by Haynes:\nWhile members of the Black middle class community pursued\nthe dream of self-sufficient individualism, racial antagonism and\ndiscrimination prevented them from abandoning a racialized\n253\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\nworldview. Runyon Heights residents have, as yet been unable to\n“afford” to give up race and simply be individuals. As scholars from\nthe left and right champion the notion of a raceless society, Runyon\nHeights is a testament to the enduring legacy of racialization\n(p. 165).\nThis book is part of a growing collection of insider perspectives on black\nurban communities that are gradually changing the way these places\nare perceived. If we are ever going to adequately conceptualize urban\nAfrican-American residential spaces, the people that live the experience\nof being black in urban America must be utilized as the primary source\nof information. Red Lines, Black Spaces is a move in that direction.\n254\n']</pre>
