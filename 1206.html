The propertv lies a\nbout four miles west of Port Gibson,\nand contains 1050 acres. The price\npaid, a part of which is paid by other\nlands in Missouri, is riven at $25,000.\nFor the past two years this planta\ntion has been operated by L. D.

No. 2 and go to Hankinson. Mr.\nByrnes has certainly been misinform\ned, for I don\'t care where he got his\ninformation it is not correct, and\nthere is nothin"- to it. He says that\nhe understands-that all the commis\ns uners are in the same neighborhood.\nThere is where he is wrong again:\nthere are no road commissioners in\nthe 3rd Dist. and won\'t be any until\nthe bonds are voted for; and if they\nare voted for, I will have the app\nn.ent of the commissioners, and I\nassure Mr. Byrnes that I will appoint\nmen that will lay self aside and select\nsuch roads that will redown to the\nbe t interest of a majority of the peo\nple, und the interest -of the citizens\nof Hickory Ridge neighborhood will\nb( locked after and protected.\nIt is to be regretted that there\nare a few criticizers and chronic kick\ners in this district, as well as other\ndistricts of the county, and as far as\nI am concerned they are ignored by\nme, as I don\'t pay any attention to\nany such. I am going to represent\nthe best interest of tne majority of\nthe people. If I make mistakes and\nerr, it will on the side of the people.\nRespectfully,\nJ. A. REGAN.\noint\nwill\nany such\nF. A.

This will certainly include the\nroute that runs right to "Mack\'s" yard\ngate as well as my gate.\nNow as to the commissioners; how\nor who has informed "Mack" that the\ncommissioners have already been ap\npointed? That is impossible\'. The\nbonds will have to be sold ,or, at least\ni-ssured, before the board can appoint\nthe road commissioners; and I am\nsure that the east side of the district\nwill be represented if they will\ncept the honorable position.\nMen\ncent.\nmen\ncent.\ncent.\nmay\nDRY\nall\ncular\n331-3\nac\n■BBIBBHBIBBHDBIIKIIII KBBBBBBBnBKIIBBBBBB\n*\nn\nIB\n»\na\nn\na\na\nr»\na\na\n*\na\nTHE\n«\n■\ns\n«SIGN OF U\nÄSERVICE/&\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\n#\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\na\nB\nB\nB\nB\n!\nM\nM\nBills!

SAGER WRITES\nABOUT OIL PROSPECTS\nIn a letter to the editor of the Rev\neille, Capt. G. H. Sager, who is su\nperintending the construction of a\npower plant at Arcadia La., says:\n"I see by the Reveille that Clai\nborne county is trying to get on the\noil map. It is a great game, and will\nsurely wake up the old town.\n"I see that Mr. Kramer is -\ngrill. I am not surprised, for y\nusually are not far off the trail wh\nyou go mit after delinquents.\n"In relation to the oil game, this\nlocality has become many thousands\nof dollars richer than it was a year\nago, when the first movements were\nmade to find oil.\n"The head of the above corpora\ntion [Lummus Oil Company] is an olii\nacquaintance of mine who ml had not\nseen for 26 years or more. ;\ninto this region and has acquired a\nbout 3500 acres of land and has spent\n$80,000 up to this time without gett\ning oil enough to soil his fingers, and\nis still plugging.\n"My son Captain George Sager is\nat the head of another company, and\nthey have let contracts to the amount\nof $50,000 for two wells, the Ä - is\ndown about 360 feet.\n"There are about fifteen wells be\ning drilled in this and close by parish\nes, and so far nothing has been found.\nThe same conditions were found in\nthe great Homer section, and sr me of\nthe wells were abandoned after coing\na certain depth, since which t\'me they\nhave been drilled deeper and bnvc\nproven most nrofitable.\n"I hope that oil can be had in Clai\nborne, but 1 haven\'t much hope; al\nthough the trend of the oil producing\nland is towards that part of Missis\nsippi and it may be found. Yet this\nlocality is in the direct line of oil pro\nducing territory, but it is found here\nin pockets, not like the field south an]\n■vest of here."\na\nll\n• ■\nHp came\n1\n$3.\n,,\nMARGIN OF PROFITS BY\nFAIR PRICE COMMITTEE\nFollowing are the margins of profit\nallowed by the Federal Fair Price\nCommittee:\nMen and Boy\'s Suits—\nCosting up to $25, 331-3 per cent.\nCosting from $25 to $50, 35 percent\nCosting from $50 and up, 40 per\ncent.\nLadies\' and Misses\' Suits -—\nN.

Mr. F. A. Pe\'-ton,\nspokesman for the party stated to\nthe board that they had been \'"able\nto get a physician over the roads and\nthat thev had had but two mails for\nfour months. It was contended that\nthe work which had been recently\ndone was not satisfactorv.\nSupervisor Regs\ncourse by saying th\ntractor to put his machine on the\nroads just as soon as they were dry\nenough to work; that the weather and\nnot the contractor was responsible for\nthis and ail other bad roads of the\ncounty. Supervisors Trim and Se\ngrest took the same view. Mr. Trim\nstated that the contractors cannot be\nexpected to keep the roads up to con\ntract specifications because of the\ngreat increase in cost of work of ail\nkinds; that he thinks the contract\nacted as\nan defended his\nat he had the con\nmf\nmm\n■\n\'\nm\n:\n»\n1 NAZIMOVA in "THE RED LANTERN\nI price should be either increased or the\ncontracts annulled.\nThe nartv invited the board to visit\nthe roads in a ltody and make an in\nspection of them; however, there was\nno promise made by the members to\ndo this.\nA.\nTWO BOND ISSUES FOR\nTOWN OF PORT GIBSON\nCon\nfol\nA.\nH.\nG.\nG.\nR.\nmar\nand\nap\nand\nof\nfor\nas\n11\nThe board of aldermen has ordered\ntwo election to determine whether,\nthere shall be bond issues amounting\nto a total of $60,000.\nelection, for an issue of\n$10,000, is called for April 29th.

The\nother tract was the property of Miss\nEmma Taussig, who is now in Ger\nmany, and the property was bought\nin by a friend in order that it might\nbe saved for her.\nDIST. 3 TO VOTE\n$50,000 ROAD BONDS\nA largely signed petition from the\nvoters of Dist.

Representative Persy\nQuin of Mississippi walks proudly in\nto the capitol each day to take his\nseat in the House carrying the "full\ndinner pail," for he is a hearty eater\nand enjoys the home-cooked viands.\nIt was Representative Quin who re\ncently made a speech in the House\nwhen the customary congressional\ngarden seed graft was under fire and\nwho made an impassioned and almost\ntearful plea to his colleagues not to\n"take the fVesh vegetables out of the\nmouths of babes."\nRepresentative Quin has a frugal\nsoul. He enjoys his homely corn cob\npipe in the cloak room and lobby of\nthe House and buys his tobacco a\nmonth\'s supply at a time because he\ngets it cheaper that way. He says he\nsmokes about a pound and a half a\nmonth.\n-\nAnd yet he is one of that group in\nCongress who docs not need to econo\nmize, for he is rated as a rich man\nand admits he is "pretty well fixed."\nRepresentative Quin is proud of the\nfact that he is self educated.\n"I vote, naturally, against food\nwaste and extravagance," he soys\n"because frugality is inbred in me\nby the hardships and deprivations of\ntry early life." He boasts that when\nhe was putting himself through\nschools and colleges he washed and\nironed his own clothes. Now he owns\ntwo or three laundries.\nOUR ADVERTISERS.\nToday\'s Reveille announces the\ncoming of Nazimova, the movie star,\nin "The Red Lantern" on April 22nd.\nThe Mississippi Southern Bank is\nurging economy and encournging sav\ning.

Mrs. Rogers for\nmerly lived at Wenatchee, Wash.,\nwhere she is also well k"\'-.\n"My health was so bad for y\nthat 1 became almost a physical\nm rvous v. reck," she\nbail nervohs indigestion, disordered I\nkidneys ami other troubles.\nears\nand\ncontinued. "I\nI was\nperfectly miserable and for over two\nyears I could not eat any bread, milk !\nor meat, and had to live on the very |\nh\'-htest oi foods. I suffered so that\nsleep was almost impossible and I fell j\noff to a mere shadow of my former\nself. I " as under constant treatment\nfor eighteen months but kept getting\nworse instead of better. I nearly\ngave up all hope and my husband, too, !\nthought I was going to die.

I\nTt v.as then that a lady from Van\ncouver persuaded me to try Tanlao !\nand it was just three dp-s before I\nnoticed a change for the better. I\nhave now taken five bottles, have\npained eighteen pounds and all of mv j\nold troubles are gone entirely. I eat,\nthree good meals every day and sleep\nlike a child all night long.

If your child has a cold when !\ndiphtheria is prevalent you should i\ntake him out of school and keep him j\noff the street until fully recovered,\nthere is a hundred times more danger\nof his taking diptheria when he has ;\na cold. When Chamberlain\'s Cough !\nRemedy is given it quickly cures the ;\ncold and lessens the danger of dipth- 1\neria or any other germ disease be- !\ning contracted.
