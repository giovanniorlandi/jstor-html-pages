On the other\nside, however, the attorney general\nof the state is required by the law\nto appear in court for the temp?r?\nanos .sitie, since the decision ??f the\ncircuit judges upheld the sitie taken\nby the county prosecuting attorney.\nilaaJBUali by l)?aan 4 Orbison, it\nwill certainly make a strong legal\ncombination which will plead for\nthe judicialaliolishmentof Indiana\'s\nliquor license law,"\nProhibition papers are full of\nencouraging* news.

Other ani?\nmals never do It except to satisfy th r\n? hunger or in the rage of combat. No\nanimal ever torments another for the\nmere purpose of tormenting, but I\nd-M-s it, ami It Is this that constitutes\nthat diabolical feature in his character\nwhich is so much worse than the mere\nly animal. I have already spoken of\nthe matb\'r in Its lirond aspect, but it ?s\n? maulfest even in small things, and\nevery reader bas a dally opportunity of\n\\ observing it. Par instance. If two litili?\ndogs ar.? piaying together and what :i\ngenial and charming sight It Is!?at l\n, a child of three or four years Joins\nthem. It Is almost Inevitable for It to\nI begin hitting ttiem with a whip ?r\nstick and thereby show Itself, even at\nthat age, the worst of animals. The\nlove of teasiug und p.a^g trie:. .\nwhich Is common enough. may be tra?\ned to the same source. For in-dauce, if\na man has ex pre ?ed his annoyance at\nany interruption or other petty incon?\nvenience, there will lie no lack of |\npie who for that very reason will bring\nIt about. This is so certain that a man\nshouM be careful not to express any\nannoyance at small evils. On the other\nhand, lie should also be careful not to\nexpress his pleasure at any trifle, for.\nif he does so, men will act like the\nJailer, who, when he found that Ufl\nprisoner bad performed the laborious\ntask of taming a spider and took a\npleasure In watching It, immediately\ncrushed it under his foot. This is why\nall animals are Instinctively afraid of\nthe sight or even of the track of a\nman, that animal m?chant par excel?\nlence!
