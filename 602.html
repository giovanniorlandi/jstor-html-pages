But in his first term as president, his \nadministration was determined to significantly lower the foreign \npolicy priority of North Korea and carried out a policy of concerted \ndisengagement, an approach the administration called "strategic \npatience. " The strategy of disengagement showed disappointing \nresults by late 2010, and so the United States made a begrudging, \ntactical adjustment by starting tentative bilateral talks with the \nDPRK. When the preliminary result of those talks—the "Leap Day \nDeal"—fell apart in 2012 over the satellite launch controversy, the \nwrong lesson was learned: that neither sanctions nor engagement \nworks with Pyongyang. The real lesson of Obama\'s North Korea pol\xad\nicy is the failure of disengagement. Keywords: Barack Obama for\xad\neign policy; engagement; North Korea; nuclear proliferation; \nUS-DPRK relations.\nDespite routinely identifying North Korea\'s nuclear program \nas a top national security issue over the past four years, the \nBarack Obama administration has in fact significantly lowered the \npriority of dealing with the Democratic People’s Republic of \nKorea (DPRK). The administration has also placed decisions \nabout North Korea behind larger strategic concerns, such as man\xad\naging the rise of China and heading off the Iranian nuclear pro\xad\ngram. This reduced attention to North Korea comes as something \nof a surprise, because as a presidential candidate Obama indicated \nthat he would strengthen US engagement with North Korea. The \nconventional account is that Pyongyang behaved provocatively \nand irresponsibly, thus leaving Obama no choice but to “punish” \nthe DPRK. However, a closer examination of the record, drawing \non the accounts of administration officials themselves, reveals \nthat once in office the Obama administration was, for a variety of\n149\n', '150 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nreasons, predisposed to carry out a policy of concerted disengage\xad\nment. The administration spumed high-level contacts and serious \nnegotiations with Pyongyang in favor of an approach it called \n“strategic patience.”\nIn this article I identify the factors that led Obama down the \npath of disengagement: the widespread view in Washington that \nPyongyang would never give up its nuclear weapons, making \nnegotiations about them a fool’s errand; the mixed results of the \nGeorge W. Bush administration’s second-term engagement efforts \nand the aversion to investing political capital on an issue that pro\xad\nduced such limited returns; intensified speculation that the North \nKorean regime might soon collapse in the wake of Kim Jong-il’s \nstroke in August 2008; optimism that sanctions were getting \n“smarter” and might be more effective in punishing Pyongyang— \nand would send a message to Iran, a higher counterproliferation \npriority; frustration in cooperating with Beijing combined with the \nperceived utility of a threatening North Korea in containing \nChina’s rise; and, last but not least, the new South Korean presi\xad\ndent’s reversal of Seoul’s decadelong engagement policy. \nTogether, these six factors disabused President Obama of any seri\xad\nous interest in talking to Pyongyang. Kim Jong-il, predictably, \nmet the US disregard and South Korean implacability with con\xad\nfrontational measures of his own. A vicious cycle was set in \nmotion.\nBy late 2010, it was becoming painfully apparent in Washing\xad\nton that disengagement was not “breaking the cycle of North \nKorean provocations” (Sanger and McDonald 2010). Nor were \nsanctions slowing down their nuclear program or leading the Kim \nregime to the brink of collapse. The United States therefore \nattempted a tentative bilateral pre-engagement initiative in the \nsecond half of 2011. However, US and DPRK diplomats tripped \nover their own feet in this fledgling effort, which culminated in \ntheir announcement of a deal on February 29, 2012. The swift \ndemise of this so-called Leap Day Deal generated a false lesson: \nneither engagement nor sanctions can change North Korean \nbehavior. When it comes to Pyongyang, nothing works.\nA closer analysis reveals that disengagement and deprioritiza\xad\ntion remained at the core of the Obama administration’s approach\n', 'John Delury 151\nto North Korea throughout the first term. As Martin Indyk, Ken\xad\nneth Lieberthal, and Michael O’Hanlon noted in their overview of \nObama’s first-term foreign policy record, “Although the Obama \nadministration regarded North Korea as very important in terms \nof the global nuclear proliferation issue, it determined that North \nKorea would not be a major driver of the administration’s Asian \npolicy” (Indyk, Lieberthal, and O’Hanlon 2012, 36). Even the \nbilateral talks of 2011-2012 were a begrudging, tactical adjust\xad\nment to manage the increasingly obvious inadequacies of disen\xad\ngagement, as opposed to being part of a determined, strategic \ndrive to reengage the DPRK.\nAs President Obama charts the course of the legacy he will \nleave behind in his second term, gaining a critical perspective on \nthe disappointments of disengagement as they played out in his \nfirst term is an important point of consideration. In so doing, the \nUnited States may fashion a more effective North Korea policy.\nGoing Nuclear: The Background Literature\nThe question of why some countries go nuclear, and why most do \nnot, remains open to debate. Most studies agree that dissuading a \ncountry from pursuing a nuclear weapons capability depends on \nsustained and high-level international engagement, especially the \nprovision of economic and security inducements (Campbell, Ein\xad\nhorn, and Reiss 2004; Solinger 2012). Many proliferation theo\xad\nrists emphasize domestic determinants in a leadership’s decision \nto acquire the bomb, such as the resolve of “oppositional nation\xad\nalist” leaders (Hymans 2006) or the weakness of “internationaliz\xad\ning” elites (Solinger 2007). Yet even these arguments imply that \nonly concerted engagement by foreign powers might be sufficient \nto coopt an opposition leader or empower an internationalist fac\xad\ntion, and thereby head off or redirect nuclear ambitions.\nOn the topic of North Korea specifically, an extensive norma\xad\ntive literature debates various engagement strategies from a US \npolicy perspective—whether constructive (Delury, Kartman, and \nShirk 2009; Kim and Kang 2009; Wit 2009; Kim, Seliger, and \nRoehrig 2011), hawkish (Cha and Kang 2003; An, Eberstadt, and\n', '152 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nYi 2004), or subversive (Lankov 2009). Other studies, employing \na descriptive narrative approach, chronicle how the Bill Clinton \nadministration, after briefly considering a surgical strike on the \nYongbyon nuclear complex, ultimately responded to the first \nNorth Korean nuclear crisis through sustained bilateral engage\xad\nment under the 1994 Agreed Framework (Sigal 1998; Wit, Pone- \nman, and Galluci 2005; Pritchard 2007), and how George W. \nBush, after shunning Pyongyang as a member of the “axis of \nevil,” shifted in his second term to multilateral engagement via \nthe Six Party Talks in order to contain North Korea’s second \nnuclear breakout (Carlin and Lewis 2008; Chinoy 2008).\nIn this article I aspire to extend that body of work into the \nObama years by making a critical descriptive assessment of the \norigins and evolution of the administration’s North Korea policy. \nBy tracing the origins of disengagement and its failure to advance \nUS goals of denuclearization, peace, and stability on the Korean \npeninsula, I hope to make a modest contribution to the ongoing \ndebate over how to deal with Pyongyang, if not to the larger con\xad\nversation about the international dimension to nuclear nonprolif\xad\neration and denuclearization.\nDisengaging the President-Elect\nThe Candidate: Engaging Adversaries\nThe degree to which the Obama administration actively disen\xad\ngaged from North Korea is particularly striking given the posi\xad\ntions that the president held as a candidate. Senator Obama ran as \nan antiwar liberal Democrat and took bold positions advocating \nmultilateral internationalism and direct engagement with US \nadversaries, including Kim Jong-il. But the gap between candidate \nObama’s promises and President Obama’s policies on North \nKorea would turn out to be something of a chasm.\nThe most memorable moment in which North Korea came up \nduring Obama’s road to the White House was the fifth Democratic \nParty primary debate in July 2007, when Senator Obama rather \ncontroversially promised that he would be willing to meet with\n', 'John Delury 153\nleaders of “rogue states,” including North Korea, in his first year \nin office “in order to bridge the gaps between our countries” (as \nthe question put it). “And the reason is this,” Obama said force\xad\nfully, “that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is \npunishment to them—which has been the guiding principle of this \n[the George W. Bush] administration—is ridiculous. ... I think it \nis a disgrace that we have not talked to them” (Obama 2007). \nImmediately after the debate, Hillary Clinton’s camp went on the \nattack, arguing that Obama’s comment betrayed his naivete \nregarding diplomacy and weakness on national security. But \nObama stood his ground. According to James Mann, “He \n[Obama] pushed back aggressively, insisting he had been right, \nand ordered his aides not to back down. ‘We decided to be pug\xad\nnacious, rather than defensive,’ recalled Obama’s campaign man\xad\nager, David Plouffe” (Mann 2012, 85).\nAlthough political advisers such as Plouffe stood by Obama’s \ninstinct to sit down and talk with US enemies, his foreign policy \ngurus were not necessarily on board. In his memoirs, the Obama \ncampaign’s senior Asia adviser, Jeffrey Bader, who would be \nappointed National Security Council (NSC) senior director for \nAsian affairs, admits to a rare instance of breaking with Obama \nover this issue of willingness to engage adversaries:\nI myself was uncomfortable with the statement, feeling it lacked \nthe nuance that Obama normally conveyed. So were others in the \nforeign policy team. During my time in office, I never heard the \nstatement reiterated in any form, suggesting that, as I had assumed, \nit was meant to convey tactical flexibility under the right circum\xad\nstances, not an intention to chase after dictators. Clarification came \nin his inaugural address, when Obama said he was prepared to reach \nhis hand out to adversaries if they reciprocated. (Bader 2011, 29)\nBader’s discomfort was understandable. Between that summer \n2007 debate and Obama’s first inaugural, it looked from the out\xad\nside as though Obama might really make some bold diplomatic \nmove to address long-standing foreign policy quagmires, even if \nthat meant sitting down with unsavory regimes. Bader grew frus\xad\ntrated by the unwieldy mixture of views in the campaign’s Asia \npolicy advisory team, as it swelled from six to sixty members\n', '154 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nafter Obama effectively secured the nomination in June 2008. \nBader mentions North Korea in particular as an area where there \nwas too wide a spread of views, forcing him into the unpleasant \nposition of “adjudicating differences on policy toward North \nKorea within our group, which mirrored the fierce debates of the \nlast decade and a half on how to deal with the country’s nuclear \nweapons program” (Bader 2011, xix). But this frustrating internal \ndissension was finally resolved after the general election in \nNovember, when the original “compact” nucleus of Asia advisers \nreemerged as the key figures in the transition team and eventually \nthe administration itself. That core group, which Bader led, was in \nno hurry to talk to the North Koreans.\nNorth Korea to the Back Burner\nDuring the transition, Obama was surrounded by advisers, \nagents, and officials who had reached the conclusion that Kim \nJong-il had made a “strategic decision” to keep his nuclear \nweapons no matter what, and that talking to Pyongyang was \npointless. “The consensus both within the Obama administration \nand within the intelligence community was that North Korea was \ndetermined to maintain its nuclear weapons program, regardless \nof its commitments,” Bader remembers (Bader 2011, 28). At \nObama’s first full intelligence briefing, on November 6, 2008, \nPresident Bush’s director of national intelligence, Mike \nMcConnell, left no room for ambiguity. Running through the list \nof threats, he dispensed with Pyongyang in breathless fashion (as \nreported by Bob Woodward):\nAnother main threat, McConnell said, was North Korea, which had \nenough nuclear material for six bombs and an effort underway to \nincrease that. The North Korean leaders were loony. Attempts to ne\xad\ngotiate with the regime would likely repeat the Bush administra\xad\ntion’s experience. It would be “negotiate, prevaricate, escalate and \nrenegotiate,” he said. The North Koreans would talk, they would \nlie, they would escalate and threaten to walk away, and then they \nwould try to renegotiate. “That’s how it’s going to work,” Mc\xad\nConnell insisted. (Woodward 2011, 9)\n', 'John Delury 155\nObama had no follow-up questions for McConnell. Instead, \naccording to Woodward, the president-elect simply asked, “What \nelse?” and the conversation moved on to Chinese cyberthreats \n(Woodward 2011, 9).\nBy Inauguration Day, Obama had a new message that was, as \nBader called it, the “clarification” for “unstable rogue states” like \nNorth Korea (Bader 2011, 148). This may have come as a surprise \nto the North Koreans. Pyongyang apparently mistook Obama for \na leader who wanted a new kind of relationship, even a summit \nwith Dear Leader Kim Jong-il. North Korean officials even \nfloated the idea of sending a representative—reportedly, it would \nhave been their top nuclear negotiator, Vice Minister Kim Kye- \ngwan—to attend the inauguration in Washington as a demonstra\xad\nble symbol of rapprochement. But Obama’s team shot down the \nidea (Agence France-Presse 2009).\nHad Kim Kye-gwan been standing in the ebullient crowd on \nthat brisk day in January 2009, he probably would not have been \nencouraged by the one line in the inaugural address presumably \nintended (in part) for his superiors in Pyongyang. “To those who \ncling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of \ndissent,” Obama said, “know that you are on the wrong side of \nhistory, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to \nunclench your fist.” Although this line was interpreted in the US \npolitical world as an expression of Obama’s open mind, North \nKoreans probably knew better. Suddenly, the onus was on adver\xad\nsaries to unclench their fists first; only then could they expect a \nhandshake from the new president. That is not the “sequencing” \nthat small powers look for in order to improve relations with a \nhostile superpower.\nBarack Obama’s inheritance from George W. Bush was admit\xad\ntedly a particularly “daunting agenda,” as the late Richard Hol\xad\nbrooke put it (Campbell and Steinberg 2008; Holbrooke 2008; \nSanger 2009). Notably, the biggest perceived threat to the domi\xad\nnant global position and national security of the United States as \nObama took office was not a terrorist network, rogue regime, or \nrising power. Rather, the desperate straits of the US economy \nwere the main threat. The United States could no longer afford\n', '156 The Disappointments of Disengagement\npost-September 11, 2001, defense spending, although military \nspending continued to rise to $700 billion by 2011 (Stockholm \nInternational Peace Research Institute 2012). This impetus to start \nbringing down military spending played into the predilections of \nthe incoming president, who ran as an antiwar liberal and prom\xad\nised to bring US troops home from the unpopular and prolonged \nconflict in Iraq.\nThese twin priorities of Obama’s first year in office—get out \nof the financial crisis and get out of Iraq—were considered so \nmomentous that perennial issues like North Korea were put on the \nback burner. Some observers outside the government argued that \npassivity was an unwise approach to the DPRK, whereas swift, \nproactive outreach might at least keep the Six Party Talks mov\xad\ning in the direction of denuclearization (Delury 2008/2009; Sigal \n2009). But the implicit message of the new administration was \nthat Pyongyang should get in line and wait its turn. North Korea \nwas a low priority from the get-go.\nAppointed to Disengage\nAs soon as Obama formally assumed office, the logic of disen\xad\ngagement took effect. Jeffrey Bader tells a revealing anecdote in \nhis memoirs about an unsent cable that shows how quickly this \nprocess commenced. On the day after inauguration, Bader \nreceived a draft cable authored by a Bush-era holdover in the \nState Department addressed “to the people of North Korea” in the \nname of the new secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton. \nAlthough its contents were anodyne, the intention was “to provide \nthe North Koreans with a sense of continuity in policy.” Bader \nwas outraged. He called one of Assistant Secretary Christopher \nHill’s deputies and harangued him over the phone with instruc\xad\ntions that the new president didn’t want to be “tied to existing \nprocesses and policies” (Bader 2011, 29-30). Not only was the \ndraft cable killed, Bader barred any further communications with \nNorth Korea before first coordinating with South Korea (Republic \nof Korea; ROK) and Japan, if not China and Russia as well.\nIn addition to the unsent cable, another important thing never\n', 'John Delury 157\nhappened (the quiet hallmark of a disengagement approach): \nThere was no policy review on Korea. As one perceptive former \nClinton administration official remarked, North Korea policy was \nlooking like “Bush Lite,” which translated into a de facto disen\xad\ngagement policy. After all, even the reengagement efforts of \nBush’s second term had been constantly hedged and undercut by \nneoconservative opposition from the US Congress and from \nwithin the Bush administration itself (Lee and Miles 2006; Gurtov \n2007). The new Obama team showed no desire to take on that lin\xad\ngering congressional opposition to authorizing or providing funds \nfor the results of serious negotiations with the DPRK. And \nalthough the neocons were out of office, the newly ascendant lib\xad\neral foreign policy establishment’s doubts about negotiating with \nNorth Korea were only a few degrees removed from the hard-line \nopposition to “appeasement” expressed by figures like John \nBolton, Bush’s UN ambassador. He maintained a high profile with \nbooks, op-eds, and media appearances, ready to attack the slight\xad\nest gesture toward engaging the DPRK (Bolton 2008).\nAnalyzing key personnel appointments in the Department of \nState with responsibility for North Korea helps to bring the con\xad\ntours of the Obama administration’s emerging disengagement into \nclearer focus. The State Department did create a new position, \nspecial representative for North Korea policy, which at first blush \nseemed on par with other high-level special envoys: George \nMitchell, appointed to handle Israel and Palestine, and Richard \nHolbrooke, charged with the US relationship with Afghanistan \nand Pakistan. But the special representative to North Korea, \nStephen Bosworth, proved to be more like an anti-envoy. He vis\xad\nited Pyongyang just once, and his role only drew attention to the \nmeager amount of political capital that the new president was \nwilling to put into dealing with the DPRK.\nBosworth had an impressive record during his service as \nambassador to South Korea, but he was never given the mandate \nor resources of other foreign policy czars, which was evident from \nthe outset. Mitchell and Holbrooke, for example, were appointed \nwith much fanfare just days after the inauguration at a special \nState Department event, with the president and the vice president \nboth standing by their sides. Bosworth’s appointment, by contrast,\n', '158 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nwas announced without ceremony in a terse press release put out \non a Friday in late February (US Department of State 2009). Like \nthe staging of their appointment announcements, the difference in \ntitles was also symbolic. Whereas Mitchell was made special \nenvoy for Middle East peace and Holbrooke special representative \nfor Afghanistan and Pakistan (“Af-Pak”), Bosworth was given the \nnarrower, and almost insular, assignment of special representative \nfor North Korea policy.1 And in stark contrast to Holbrooke, who \nresigned even from honorary positions in order to clear the decks \nfor a total focus on “Af-Pak,” Bosworth was permitted to keep his \nday job as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at \nTufts University.\nAnother key personnel appointment was Kurt Campbell to \nreplace Christopher Hill as assistant secretary for East Asia. \nCampbell is a longtime Democratic foreign policy strategist who \ncofounded the Center for a New American Security, a centrist \nthink tank designed to showcase how liberals can be just as strong \non national security as Republicans. It took until June for Con\xad\ngress to formally approve Campbell, due to objections by Senator \nSam Brownback, who demanded prior assurances that the admin\xad\nistration would take a hard line and tighten sanctions on North \nKorea and Myanmar.\nAs he waited for the hold on his nomination to be released, \nCampbell had more time than he may have wished to contemplate \nhis predecessor’s mixed legacy on Korea. By the end of the Bush \nyears, North Korea had become the central focus of Hill’s atten\xad\ntion—as Hill joked in a later talk at Yonsei University, “I was not \nthe assistant secretary for North Korea!” which is funny because \nthat is precisely how he is seen. On top of diplomatic sparring on \nregular trips to Beijing for the Six Party Talks, Hill had to fight \nepic political battles back in Washington as well, against neocon\xad\nservatives in the vice president’s office and financial sanctions \nenthusiasts in the Treasury Department, in order to keep the \nmomentum for negotiations creeping forward (Chinoy 2008).\nCampbell probably shared the view of Bader at the National \nSecurity Council (NSC), who did not want to repeat the Hill-era \npattern of enervating interagency discord over the Korean penin\xad\nsula. Bader saw North Korea as the weakest link in the Bush\n', 'John Delury 159\nadministration’s approach to Asia. “Korea policy was the subject \nof twists and turns and considerable infighting, and no one . . . was \nsatisfied with the outcomes or the process” (Bader 2011, xvii). Hill \nhad been in the middle of that maelstrom. Now Campbell, by \ndeprioritizing North Korea on his list of tasks as assistant secre\xad\ntary, could hope to avert Hill’s reputation as a lightning rod for \ninteragency conflict and for having squandered political capital by \novercommitting to an issue that produced poor results. In Camp\xad\nbell’s mind, after all, North Korea was “a land of lousy options,” \na phrase he used back in 2003 and would fall back upon later in his \ntenure as assistant secretary (Brownstein 2003; Kyodo 2012).\nAt the most senior level, Campbell and Bosworth’s boss, \nHillary Clinton, showed no strong signs of wanting to enhance \nengagement with Pyongyang or improve the functioning of US- \nDPRK relations either. In her first major speech on Asia policy, in \nadvance of her inaugural trip abroad as secretary, Clinton spoke in \nthe abstract of “America’s desire for more rigorous and persistent \ncommitment and engagement” in Asia. But when it came to North \nKorea, she put the onus almost entirely on Pyongyang. She \ndemanded that it “avoid any provocative action and unhelpful \nrhetoric toward South Korea,” and prove it was “genuinely pre\xad\npared to completely and verifiably eliminate their nuclear \nweapons program” in order to demonstrate that it was worthy of \nbeing engaged by the United States (Clinton 2009a).\n“So much of it depends upon the choices that the North \nKorean government makes,” Clinton repeated twice in response to \na question about whether the State Department would grant visas \nto allow the DPRK State Symphony Orchestra to make a recipro\xad\ncal visit to play in the United States, as the New York Philhar\xad\nmonic had done in Pyongyang (Clinton 2009a). North Korea was \nexpected to maintain good relations with the South at a time when \nthe government in Seoul had switched to a hard-line approach, \nand North Korea was expected to press on with denuclearization \ndespite the outstanding disagreements over a verification protocol \nand the perennial Japanese abduction issue. Rather than seeing \nengagement as the method to seek progress on these matters, \nClinton spoke of engagement as the reward for progress made \nunilaterally by North Korea.\n', '160 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nMaking a Policy of Disengagement: "Strategic Patience"\nBack in the heat of the 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton’s \nfuture nonproliferation adviser, Robert Einhorn, predicted that \nregardless of who won the election, there would be “a lot of con\xad\ntinuity” on North Korea policy, and that the next administration \nwould steer clear of the “anything-but-Clinton mistake” of the \nearly George W. Bush administration (Einhom 2008). Yet, accord\xad\ning to President Obama’s nonproliferation czar, Gary Samore, by \nthe spring of 2009 the administration had decided on a policy that \namounted to containment and watchful waiting. On one hand, the \nUnited States would use sanctions to tighten North Korea’s access \nto technology. On the other, “The administration would play for \ntime, waiting until there was a significant change in North \nKorea’s leadership. The Obama team called this part of the pol\xad\nicy ‘strategic patience’” (Mann 2012, 198).\nIn March, Secretary Clinton called in Bader to suggest that \nthe administration “be more reserved” about desiring a return to \nthe Six Party Talks. A new mantra was bom—“as our team put it, \nwe were not interested in ‘talks for the sake of talks,”’ Bader \nreports (Bader 2011, 33). In a senior national security meeting \nshortly thereafter, Defense Secretary Robert Gates coined another \ntalking point of North Korea policy when he insisted that the gov\xad\nernment was “not paying for the same horse three times” (Bader \n2011, 31). By the time of this meeting, the president was fully on \nboard, telling his national security team that his goal was to \n“break the cycle of provocation, extortion, and reward” of the past \nfifteen years. Bader hastens to add, “There was no mention then, \nor at any subsequent time, of candidate Obama’s suggestion of a \nwillingness to meet Kim Jong-il” (Bader 2011, 31).\nWhen Pyongyang tested Obama by launching a satellite in \nApril 2009, in other words, it only accelerated the momentum \nalready built up in the direction of disengagement—as opposed to \nhaving reversed a trend toward deepening engagement. Senator \nObama, the proactive diplomat, had been reprogrammed into a \npatient believer in crippling economic sanctions and inevitable \nregime change. “Obama’s initial talk of engagement with North \nKorea never went very far,” James Mann observed based on his\n', 'John Delury 161\nextensive interviews with administration officials. “The real pol\xad\nicy, adopted only a few months into the administration, was to \nrecognize that the current leadership in Pyongyang would never \ngive up or bargain away the nuclear weapons it already had. The \nUnited States would simply have to wait for a change in the coun\xad\ntry’s leadership” (Mann 2012, 201).\nThe Coming Collapse of North Korea\nIn public statements about “strategic patience,” US officials \nexplained that they were simply waiting for Pyongyang to stop \nbehaving like an “unruly teenager,” as Secretary Clinton put it. \nThe North Koreans should fulfill their international obligations \nand desist from further “provocations” (Reuters 2009). But North \nKoreans understood strategic patience as a euphemism for waiting \nfor Kim Jong-il to die, in hopes that the regime would then col\xad\nlapse.2 Until that day, it seemed, the United States would try to \navoid getting entangled in Korean peninsula diplomacy.\nTo some extent, Obama and his advisers were unwitting vic\xad\ntims of a historical accident—namely, Kim Jong-il’s stroke on \nAugust 14, 2008; his long absence from public view; and the \nongoing speculation that his illness would soon trigger regime \nchange from within. The Dear Leader’s visibly diminished physi\xad\ncal health when he finally reappeared in the same month Obama \nswore his oath of office gave rise to yet another burst of specula\xad\ntion that the DPRK was on the brink of collapse, that Kim’s unre\xad\nformed totalitarian system—“on the wrong side of history” \n—would at long last break when its supreme leader died (Bolton \nand Eberstadt 2008; Klinger 2008; Asia Foundation 2009; Blu\xad\nmenthal and Foragch 2009; Glaser and Snyder 2010; O’Hanlon \n2009; Stares and Wit 2009). Bader openly acknowledged the per\xad\nvasiveness of “collapsist” thinking within the US government. \n“Many of us believed that the most likely long-term solution to \nthe North’s nuclear pursuits lay in the North’s collapse and \nabsorption into a South-led reunified Korea” (Bader 2011, 92). \nBader conceded that “a strategy was still needed to slow down, \nfreeze, and degrade the North Korean [nuclear] program,” but he\n', '162 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nadded pointedly, “until history could take its course” (Bader 2011, \n92). Kim’s ill health and the absence of a designated successor \nsuggested that history was picking up its pace, feeding the admin\xad\nistration’s desire to focus elsewhere and wait patiently for condi\xad\ntions to change inside the DPRK.\nOn the first occasion when circumstances forced the admin\xad\nistration to engage Pyongyang directly, no efforts were spared to \navoid making progress. After months of delay, in August 2009 \nBill Clinton was finally dispatched on a special mission to North \nKorea to arrange for the release of two young US journalists who \nhad been arrested after they illegally crossed the China-North \nKorea border on a video documentary shoot. It would turn out to \nbe the Obama administration’s only direct contact with Kim \nJong-il, and Kim’s last conversation with a US citizen before his \ndeath in December 2011. However, the White House sent Clinton \noff with strict orders to do absolutely nothing besides bring the \ntwo journalists home. “We gave him no message, oral or written, \nto carry from President Obama,” Bader recalls. In keeping with \nthe new rule of coordinating disengagement with the allies, he \nadded, “We also gave Seoul and Tokyo notice of the visit, assur\xad\ning them there would be no negotiations” (Bader 2011, 37). Kim \nmust have been disappointed by the former president’s tight- \nlipped and dour demeanor (Clinton had instructions not to smile \nfor photographs).\nActing Out Disengagement: "Smart Sanctions"\nOn top of their pessimism that Pyongyang would give up its \nnuclear weapons and optimism that the DPRK’s days might be \nnumbered, another reason why administration officials were \nadamant that Clinton do nothing to create a breakthrough was the \nhope that the intensifying sanctions regime against North Korea \nwould prove more effective than negotiations through the Six \nParty Talks. Smart sanctions, financial sanctions, and proliferation \ninterdictions were going through something of a revival in policy \ncircles as a happy medium between war and appeasement. \nAlthough the North Korean economy was already lashed down by\n', 'John Delury 163\na thick net of economic sanctions, US officials hoped that by \ntightening the ropes they could add a new, active dimension to \ntheir disengagement policy.\nBut North Korea expelled International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) inspectors, announced resumption of its nuclear \nprogram activities and commencement of a uranium program, and \nstaged a second nuclear test on May 25, 2009. US ambassador to \nthe United Nations Susan Rice lobbied successfully for a Security \nCouncil Resolution (1864) that Bader boasted was “the most dra\xad\nconian sanctions ever placed on North Korea” (Bader 2011, 38). \nNorth Korea’s nuclear test also breathed life into the Bush admin\xad\nistration’s Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), when South \nKorea’s president Lee Myung-bak announced (on May 26) that \nthe South would join as an active participant. PSI paved the way \nfor a string of third-party interdictions related to alleged North \nKorean arms trading, from Thailand to the United Arab Emirates \n(A1 Jazeera 2009; Associated Press 2009; Fuller and Sanger \n2009). Administration officials may have begun to convince them\xad\nselves that the noose was tightening around Kim. Relentless sanc\xad\ntions enforcement, Bader explained, “would force North Korea to \nreassess the value of its program” by “breaking the cycle of North \nKorean provocation, extortion, and accommodation . . . and \nreward” (Bader 2011, 7).\nThe Moral Hazard of Iran\nSanctions specialists in the Department of the Treasury, led by \nUndersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart \nLevey—a holdover from the Bush administration—were happy to \nuse North Korean accounts as target practice in their ongoing \nefforts to punish or deter US adversaries through the international \nfinancial system. Even if draconian sanctions had little impact on \nthe North Korean nuclear issue, they would have a salutary \ndemonstration effect on the more pressing nuclear counterprolif\xad\neration target of Iran. Here was a notable example of how the \nKorean peninsula situation was subsumed into another, more \nimportant issue.\n', '164 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nUnlike the DPRK, Iran had been a top foreign policy and \nnational security priority throughout Obama’s first term. The mass \ndemonstrations of Iran’s Green Movement that erupted after the \nJune 2009 presidential election there—a kind of lonely precursor \nto the great awakening of the Arab Spring two years later—forced \nIran to the front of Obama’s attention, briefly raising hopes for \nchange in Tehran. After conservatives and hard-liners reasserted \ncontrol, Iran remained a strategic priority based on the US desire \nto check its regional influence; interrupt its support for US adver\xad\nsaries in the Middle East; and, with increasing urgency, arrest fur\xad\nther progress in its nuclear program.\nThe controversy over how to handle the Iranian nuclear pro\xad\ngram led to another triangulation of Korea policy. Policies toward \nNorth Korea were designed with Iran in mind. North Korea came \nto be seen as a future scenario for an Iran that Washington des\xad\nperately wanted to avert—a de facto nuclear state. One obvious \nway to strengthen the argument to Tehran that a nuclear breakout \nwould be self-destructive was to bolster the sanctions regime \nagainst Pyongyang. Punishing Pyongyang with “crippling” sanc\xad\ntions would convince those in Tehran who might have hoped \nWashington lacked the political will to see through a comprehen\xad\nsive sanctions regime (Clinton 2009b, 19). As Secretary Clinton \ncommented, “If we can create a sanctions track that targets those \nwho actually make the decisions, we think that is a smarter way to \ndo sanctions” (Associated Press 2010).\nConversely, the administration viewed “rewarding” North \nKorea with negotiations—let alone with substantive concessions, \nand before the DPRK had recommenced denuclearization—as a \nkind of moral hazard relative to the more strategically important \nand diplomatically plausible counterproliferation priority of Iran. \n“Thwarting the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran is crit\xad\nical to shoring up the nonproliferation regime,” Secretary Clinton \nexplained in the fall of 2009. She continued,\nCurrent sanctions will not be relaxed until Pyongyang takes verifi\xad\nable, irreversible steps toward complete denuclearization. Its lead\xad\ners should be under no illusion that the United States will ever have \nnormal, sanctions-free relations with a nuclear-armed North Korea. \n. . . The door is open to a better future for Iran, but the process of\n', 'John Delury 165\nengagement cannot be open-ended. We are not prepared to talk just \nfor the sake of talking. (Clinton 2009c)\nObama administration officials insisted that they refused to \n“reward bad behavior” on the part of the North Koreans by engag\xad\ning in “talks for the sake of talks.” It was not only North Korea \nthat might get the wrong message; more perilous still was that \nIran would look on North Korea and feel emboldened to play \nnuclear brinkmanship with the West. This view also prevailed in \nCongress. As the ranking Republican member on the House For\xad\neign Affairs Committee put it to Secretary Clinton, “North \nKorea’s weapons drive has implications beyond Pyongyang. . . . \nIran and Syria are closely watching how we deal with North \nKorea. Will they conclude that we will treat them as generously as \nwe have treated Pyongyang?” (Ros-Lehtinen 2009, 4).\nIran was not the only higher-priority country that loomed \nbehind US policymaking on North Korea. China was there, too. \nThe difference is that administration officials did not acknowl\xad\nedge the China connection, which was precisely the point.\nProxy for the China Pivot\nLike Iran, China was on the short list of foreign policy priority \nareas for Obama from day one, if for no other reason (and there \nwere certainly others) than because of Beijing’s sizable holdings \nof US debt and China’s central role in the prospects for global \neconomic recovery. Initially, the Obama administration made con\xad\ncerted efforts to open a new page in US-China cooperation—for \nexample, by not irritating Beijing through public censure on sen\xad\nsitive issues like human rights and Tibet. The administration also \ntried strenuously to forge bold cooperation on a joint response to \nclimate change in advance of the Copenhagen climate conference \nscheduled for December 2009.\nNorth Korea was the early exception to this rule of trying hard \nto cooperate in 2009. Presidents Obama and Hu Jintao never saw \neye to eye on North Korea, so coordinating responses to North \nKorea was a distracting bone of contention rather than a zone of \ncooperation. This situation was in marked contrast with George\n', '166 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nW. Bush, who by the end of his second term proudly pointed to \nthe Six Party Talks as the prime example of successful US-China \ncooperation. “I think you should look at the [US-China] relation\xad\nship as one of constructive engagement, where you can find com\xad\nmon areas like North Korea and Iran,” Bush said in a televised \ninterview during the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, expressing a \nsentiment that would be unthinkable under Obama (NBC 2008).\nBy the start of Obama’s second year, the administration began \nto recalibrate its China policy, frustrated by what it perceived as \nBeijing’s assertiveness in the face of US flexibility (Landler \n2012). US officials started to toughen up on Taiwan arms sales, \nthe Dalai Lama, trade disputes, and Internet freedom. They \nactively took sides with China’s neighbors in the many maritime \ndisputes that began breaking out across East Asia. Over the course \nof 2010, Chinese policy experts began to speak of “neo-Cold \nWar” dynamics developing in East Asia.3 Secretary Clinton later \nput a catchy label on the enhanced US attention to and presence in \nthe region when she spoke in late 2011 of a “pivot to Asia” (Clin\xad\nton 2011). Despite mild US assurances to the contrary, and even \nafter changing the official nomenclature to the more innocuous- \nsounding “rebalancing toward Asia,” the Chinese foreign policy \ncommunity almost universally viewed “the pivot” as a euphemism \nfor containing China’s rise.\nObama’s China policy evolved into something like Aaron \nFriedberg’s “congagement,” in which the United States continually \ndeepens its engagement with China—especially economically— \nwhile hedging against the security implications of China’s rise by \nputting in place the means to contain Beijing’s great power ambi\xad\ntions (Friedberg 2011). In tune with congagement, North Korea \nserved as a convenient proxy to justify US moves to strengthen \nalliances and develop capabilities in Northeast Asia with “dual- \nuse” value in counterbalancing against growing Chinese strength.\nPrimacy of the Ally\nAs if all these reasons underlying Obama’s disengagement from \nthe North were not enough, there was one more critical factor: \nrevitalization of the US-South Korea alliance.\n', 'John Delury 167\nThe previously rocky relations between the White House and \nthe Blue House were another negative legacy of the Bush era, \nwhen US policy on Korea was said to have suffered from “further \nstrains being created by a leader in Seoul [Roh Moo-hyun] who \nseemed less than fully committed to the alliance” (Bader 2011, 1). \nBut Roh was gone, and the South Korean leader waiting for \nObama in Seoul, Lee Myung-bak, was avidly proalliance. Presi\xad\ndent Lee was in equal measure opposed to his liberal predeces\xad\nsors’ so-called Sunshine Policy of inter-Korean dialogue, \nopenness, reconciliation, and economic cooperation.\nLee assumed office in February 2008, giving him a year’s \nhead start in disengaging South Korea from the North, a process \nthat was already well under way by the time Obama was elected \n(Moon 2012). Lee made clear that he had no interest in pursuing \nthe cooperative agenda that Roh and Kim Jong-il developed at the \nOctober 2007 inter-Korean summit, where they agreed to create a \nnew joint zone of peace and economic cooperation in the West \nSea in order to prevent further inter-Korean maritime conflict. \nInstead, Lee announced a new North Korea policy of “Vision \n3,000 Through Denuclearization and Openness,” which made the \nfull range of inter-Korean relations contingent on denucleariza\xad\ntion. Lee promised that Seoul would raise North Koreans’ per \ncapita annual income to $3,000 as a reward for Pyongyang’s giv\xad\ning up its nuclear program (Suh 2009). Meanwhile, Seoul sus\xad\npended shipments of fertilizer, upon which the North Korean \nagricultural economy relied heavily in order to meet the basic \nfood needs of its people (Choe 2008). When North Korean secu\xad\nrity officers shot and killed a South Korean tourist who strayed \ninto an off-limits area at the Mount Kumgang resort in July 2008, \nSeoul refused to accept Pyongyang’s account, demanding an \ninvestigation. That major project of inter-Korean cooperation, vis\xad\nited by almost 350,000 South Koreans in 2007 alone, closed down \nas a result.\nPresidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun had opened a \nnew era in inter-Korean relations by holding summits with the \nNorth Korean leader. Yet despite constant rumors that Lee would \nmeet with Kim, a third summit never materialized. In 2007, the \nlast year of the Roh administration, the two Koreas held fifty-five \nofficial talks, thirteen of which were political dialogues. In 2008,\n', '168 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nLee’s first year in office, the two governments held only six talks, \nnone of which was a political dialogue (Republic of Korea, Min\xad\nistry of Unification 2008). Before Obama even stepped into the \nOval Office, Seoul was well into its new disengagement approach \nto inter-Korean relations.\nJust how uncompromising and hard-line Seoul’s new attitude \nreally was might not have been clear to policymakers in Washing\xad\nton. It was especially hard to discern because Lee and his diplo\xad\nmats conducted a full-scale charm offensive to demonstrate their \ndevotion to the alliance and flexibility in managing US-ROK rela\xad\ntions. As Bader recalls, administration officials immediately \npicked up on the fact that Lee Myung-bak was “anxious” to get \nalong with Obama, who in turn was quickly won over by Lee as \n“someone Washington could work closely with” (Bader 2011, 32- \n34). That initial bond intensified in the years to come, to such a \ndegree that the Obama-Lee relationship would be likened to “a \npresidential man-crush” (Landler 2011). In the last year of his \nfirst term, Obama spontaneously named Lee one of the five world \nleaders with whom he enjoyed the closest “friendships and bonds \nof trust” (Zakaria 2012).\nThe comprehensive strengthening of the US-ROK alliance \nand the close bond between their leaders generated a constant pull \naway from engaging Pyongyang. The chronic tension between the \ntwo Koreas reinforced US perceptions that North Korea was \nincorrigibly hostile and provocative. Choosing to engage the \nDPRK on the nuclear issue risked creating daylight between the \nUnited States and its best-behaved ally in East Asia. Why jeop\xad\nardize the sure benefits of tightening relations with an especially \nloyal ally for the prospect of meager progress in dealing directly \nwith its enemy?\nDisengagement Backfires\nThe Cheonan Incident\nThese externalities—the political logic of strengthening the US- \nROK alliance, the strategic priorities of managing China’s rise\n', 'John Delury 169\nand stopping an Iranian bomb, and what might be called an \n“anything-but-Hill” complex (referring to Christopher Hill)— \nreinforced the pessimistic assessments of Pyongyang’s nuclear \nintentions (no surrender) and optimistic speculation about its \npolitical stability (nearing collapse). Together they propelled the \nObama administration down the path of disengagement. Washing\xad\nton’s stated objective vis-a-vis Pyongyang was that by not engag\xad\ning in “talks for the sake of talks,” by refusing to “buy the same \nhorse three times,” and by implementing “draconian sanctions,” \nthe United States would be able to contain the nuclear threat. \nOver the course of Obama’s second year in office, however, the \ncycle of hostility and conflict on the Korean peninsula intensified \nrather than ended. Meanwhile, North Korea’s nuclear program \nadvanced in leaps and bounds.\nOn March 26, 2010, the South Korean corvette Cheonan, used \nmostly to patrol in antisubmarine operations, sank in ROK-con- \ntrolled waters off Baeknyeong Island, ten miles from the North \nKorean coast. Forty-six sailors lost their lives. According to \nBader, President Lee immediately suspected a covert North \nKorean attack and indicated as much to Obama (although public \nstatements at the time were more cautious). “We did not yet have \nconclusive evidence about North Korean involvement in the sink\xad\ning of the Cheonan," Bader recalls. However, Lee called Obama \nto say that “the cause of the sinking was an externally induced \nexplosion. The evidence seemed to be building that the North was \nresponsible” (Bader 2011, 84).\nThe ROK military established a Joint Civilian-Military Inves\xad\ntigation Group (JIG)—with participants from the United States, \nAustralia, Britain, and Sweden—to determine the cause of the \nsinking. Pyongyang’s offer to participate in the inquiry was \nrejected out of hand. Beijing was not invited to join the commis\xad\nsion. JIG released its findings on May 20: The Cheonan “was \nsunk as the result of an external underwater explosion caused by \na torpedo made in North Korea. The evidence points overwhelm\xad\ningly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North \nKorean submarine. There is no other plausible explanation” (Joint \nCivilian-Military Investigation Group 2009). A few days later, the \nBlue House announced comprehensive sanctions, known as the\n', '170 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nMay 24 measures, that severely restricted inter-Korean commerce \nand contacts.\nIn the wake of the Cheonan incident, the Obama administra\xad\ntion abandoned passive disengagement for more forceful meas\xad\nures to constrain Pyongyang. This strategy failed at the UN \nSecurity Council where, despite intensive lobbying by the United \nStates, South Korea, and Japan, a watered-down July 9 statement \nby the Security Council president “deplored the attack” and loss \nof life but did not affirm the JIG’s “clear conclusion” of North \nKorean culpability. Washington and Seoul thereupon crafted their \nown response. Their forces staged a major military exercise in the \nEast Sea in July and announced their agreement to delay the trans\xad\nfer of operational command of forces in case of war from the \nUnited States to the ROK. The Cheonan incident even spurred \nObama and Lee to find a way forward on the Korea-US (KORUS) \nfree trade agreement, as one more symbol of the strength and \ndepth of the US-ROK alliance (Bader 2011).\nThe resolute and unified response to the Cheonan tragedy was \nsupposed to deter and constrain North Korean behavior. “We \nwanted to demonstrate to the North Koreans that provocations \ncould no longer trigger the old cycle of extortion followed by \nreward,” Bader explained (Bader 2011, 91). But North Korea’s \nwork at the Yongbyon nuclear complex was proceeding apace, \nand in early November the DPRK invited Stanford University \nphysicist Siegfried Hecker to visit the Yongbyon nuclear facilities. \nHecker, who had made numerous trips to Yongbyon, was stunned \nto find an “ultramodern” uranium enrichment facility (Hecker\n2010). Not only had “smart sanctions” failed to reduce the flow of \nluxury goods to Pyongyang, they did not slow down the North’s \nnuclear program at Yongbyon either (Congressional Research \nService 2010).\nEleven days after Hecker’s visit to Yongbyon, the North \nKorean military—after strenuously objecting to enhanced military \nexercises and firing drills staged by the ROK military along the \nNorthern Limit Line (NLL)—fired an artillery barrage on Yeon- \npyeong Island. It was the first attack on Southern territory since \nthe Korean War. Two marines and two civilians were killed \n(Delury and Moon 2011).\n', 'John Delury 171\nCounterproductive Effects\nAs inter-Korean relations unraveled and North Korea’s nuclear \nprogram steamed ahead, the Obama administration’s faith in the \nefficacy of disengagement may have begun to waver. Military \nexercises, economic sanctions, and UN Security Council censure \ndid not appear to be “managing” the North Korean issue (Snyder\n2011). A research project at the Center on Strategic and Interna\xad\ntional Studies (CSIS) led by Victor Cha, Georgetown University \nprofessor and George W. Bush’s National Security Council direc\xad\ntor for Asian affairs, calculated that over the past thirty-five years, \nNorth Korea had only once (in 1998) initiated hostilities when its \ndiplomats were engaged in official dialogue with the United \nStates. The simple math done by CSIS suggested there might be \na flaw in the logic of preventing “provocations” by withholding \nnegotiations—that, in fact, even just talking would have positive \nsecurity effects (Cha and Kim 2011).\nOne sign of Washington’s rethinking was the increasing \nreliance on Beijing to get the outcomes it wanted with North \nKorea. This dynamic was not ideal; the United States already had \na long list of priority items in its bilateral relationship with Bei\xad\njing and preferred not to waste time and energy on the DPRK. But \nat least the Beijing channel offered Washington a way to put a lid \non a situation on the peninsula that was threatening to get out of \nhand by leaning on a major power that was engaged directly with \nPyongyang.\nDays after the Yeonpyeong shelling, the USS George Wash\xad\nington supercarrier arrived in the West Sea for a four-day joint \nexercise with ROK ships (Richburg 2010).4 Seoul then announced \nplans to conduct an expanded version of the same kind of live-fire \nmilitary drills along the NLL that had precipitated the North \nKorean shelling. Anxious about the dangers of escalation, the \nObama administration leaned on Beijing to ensure that Pyongyang \nwould stand down. Obama called Hu Jintao on December 5 to dis\xad\ncuss North Korea:\nThe President condemned the North Korean shelling of a South Ko\xad\nrean island on November 23 and its pursuit of a uranium enrich\xad\nment program in defiance of its obligations. He urged China to\n', '172 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nwork with us and others to send a clear message to North Korea \nthat its provocations are unacceptable. The President also high\xad\nlighted the American commitment to the security of our allies in \nthe region. (White House 2010)\nWhether Beijing had anything to do with it, North Korea did not \nrespond to the ROK’s December exercises.\nThe summit between Obama and Hu in January 2011 was an \neven clearer sign that deprioritization of North Korea was falter\xad\ning and that disengagement might be having counterproductive \neffects. When Hu came to Washington, the Obama team deter\xad\nmined that “language on North Korea was the make-or-break \nrequirement” of releasing a joint statement out of the summit \n(Bader 2011, 124). Although US officials thought of it as a diplo\xad\nmatic victory, the language was actually mild:\nIn this context [of the Six Party Talks’ 2005 Joint Statement], the\nUnited States and China expressed concern regarding the DPRK’s \nclaimed uranium enrichment program. Both sides oppose all activ\xad\nities inconsistent with the 2005 Joint Statement and relevant inter\xad\nnational obligations and commitments. The two sides called for the \nnecessary steps that would allow for early resumption of the Six- \nParty Talks process to address this and other relevant issues. (White \nHouse 2011)\nThe Failure of "Pre-Steps"\nIn time for spring, advocates of renewed engagement with \nPyongyang started coming out of the woodwork. Perhaps the most \npolitically significant example was Senator John Kerry’s forceful \ncall for reengagement delivered at a Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing in March, which echoed the arguments made \nby then-senator Barack Obama in the 2007 Democratic Party pri\xad\nmary debate. “We have to get beyond the political talking point \nthat engaging North Korea is somehow ‘rewarding bad behav\xad\nior,”’ Kerry insisted, using the Obama administration’s own lan\xad\nguage. The United States, after all, had its own negotiating \nobjectives and was not compelled to “say yes to anything that we\n', 'John Delury 173\ndon’t want to.” Unless the United States tried talking with North \nKorea, it had “no chance of changing the current dynamic; you \nactually invite greater instability and greater potential for con\xad\nfrontation,” Kerry said. “Our silence invites a dangerous situation \nto get even more dangerous” (Kerry 2011).\nThe State Department, it turned out, was not too far behind \nKerry. A bit like Dante, who midway through Hell found himself \nwithin a dark forest, Stephen Bosworth found himself in New \nYork City on a muggy day in late July 2011, sitting across the \ntable from First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan for the first \nUS-DPRK talks since Bosworth’s uneventful trip to Pyongyang in \nDecember 2009. Bosworth and Kim met again for two days of \ntalks in Geneva in October. That month also marked the handoff \nfrom Bosworth, who stepped down, to his full-time replacement \nas special representative, Glynn Davies. Davies had been serving \nas US representative to the IAEA and UN office in Vienna, but \nwas not an expert on Korean affairs. Disengagement had been \ntemporarily suspended in order to explore “pre-steps.”\nThe Leap Day Deal\nFinally, on December 16, at the third round of discussions held in \nBeijing, Kim Kye-gwan’s subordinate, Ri Gun, director-general of \nthe DPRK Foreign Ministry Department of American Affairs, and \nthe State Department’s special envoy on North Korean human \nrights issues, Ambassador Robert King, reached a deal. As \nreported by US and South Korean media, Pyongyang agreed to \nfreeze nuclear activities at Yongbyon, refrain from testing a \nnuclear device or long-range ballistic missile, and invite back \nIAEA inspectors. In return, the United States would resume \nhumanitarian assistance and reaffirm its lack of hostile intent \ntoward the DPRK (Lee 2011a; Lee 2011b; Yonhap 2011a). The \nlead nuclear negotiators, Kim Kye-gwan and Glynn Davies, \nwould meet within a week to finalize the negotiation (Yonhap \n2011b).\nBut history had other ideas. At 8:30 a.m. Pyongyang time on \nDecember 17, Kim Jong-il died on his train. The world braced for \nthe possible collapse of the DPRK, and the State Department\n', '174 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nwondered what would happen to the Beijing “nuclear freeze for \nnutritional supplements” deal. But the DPRK did not collapse. \nEven more surprisingly, in January 2012, the North indicated to \nthe United States that Pyongyang was prepared to carry through \nwith the final round of negotiations, which took place in Beijing \nin February.\nThe Leap Day Deal, so-called because it was announced on \nFebruary 29, had all the markings of tentative engagement. The \npre-steps on both sides were highly reversible—at any moment, \nPyongyang could end its moratorium simply by restarting the \nnuclear program or testing a missile or other device. Likewise, the \nUnited States had only agreed to ship humanitarian assistance on \na monthly basis, enabling an abrupt suspension of whatever was \nleft if things didn’t work out as planned. Still, it looked like a \ngood deal for the United States, particularly because Washington \nwould get a resumption of international monitoring of North \nKorea’s nuclear complex for the first time in nearly three years \n(Delury and Moon 2012). Perhaps in retrospect the deal was too \ngood to be true.\nOn March 16, Pyongyang announced its intention to launch a \nsatellite in celebration of the centenary of the birth of the nation’s \nfounder, Kim Il-sung, also the grandfather of their new leader, \nKim Jong-un. Stunned US State Department officials insisted that \nthey had been clear with the North Koreans that from a US per\xad\nspective there was no difference between a satellite launch and a \nlong-range ballistic missile test. “We did warn them that we con\xad\nsidered that a satellite launch of this kind would be an abrogation \nof that agreement,” explained State Department spokeswoman \nVictoria Nuland (US Department of State 2012).\nThe DPRK foreign ministry countered that Pyongyang’s own \nlong-standing position had not changed: North Korea, like all \ncountries, has a sovereign right to peaceful use of space, includ\xad\ning satellite launches, a position they had made clear in discus\xad\nsions with US counterparts. The ministry’s statement indicated \nthat it remained prepared to implement the Leap Day Deal. “We \nhave already invited a delegation of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency to discuss the procedures to verify the moratorium \non uranium enrichment activities and are coming to a sincere\n', 'John Delury 175\nunderstanding for implementing the agreement with the U.S. side” \n(Korea Central News Agency 2012). The White House reportedly \ndispatched a secret last-minute mission to Pyongyang to try to \nconvince the new leadership not to go through with the launch, \nand salvage the Leap Day Deal, but to no avail (Chosun Ilbo\n2012).\nThe unraveling of the Leap Day Deal before it even took \neffect sent proponents of engagement—few to begin with— \nscrambling. Eight months of negotiations across three continents \nhad resulted in a cautious, confidence-building agreement that \nimploded barely a fortnight after it was announced. The failure of \ntentative bilateral engagement did not really validate the disen\xad\ngagement approach. But it did induce a still deeper sense of \nmalaise in Washington about the futility of even trying to get out \nof the North Korea quagmire.\nThe Obama administration had described its North Korea pol\xad\nicy as based on a “dual track” approach of using both sanctions \nand engagement. Now it seemed that both tracks were broken \nbeyond repair. North Korea’s new leadership, headed by Kim \nJong-un, was busy consolidating power. The United States and \nSouth Korea entered the full swing of the presidential election \nseason, with Obama fighting off an unexpectedly strong challenge \nby Mitt Romney, and Lee Myung-bak, barred from seeking \nreelection, shut out even by the leading conservative candidate, \nPark Geun-hye. She distanced herself from his hard-line record \nand ran on a more moderate approach to inter-Korean relations. \nChina also turned inward in the lead-up to the fall Communist \nParty Congress and its decennial leadership transition.\nLearning the Right Lessons\nWhat are the lessons to be learned from the past four years of \nNorth Korea policy? The superficial inference to draw from \nObama’s first term would seem to be that neither sanctions nor \nengagement works—that North Korea is, in the memorable phrase \nof Victor Cha, the impossible state (Cha 2012). But such fatalism \nis actually both a by-product of disengagement and a powerful\n', '176 The Disappointments of Disengagement\nrationale for perpetuating its failures. There is no evidence that a \nNorth Korea with secure borders, a peace treaty, and amicable \nrelations with the South will not be able to first disable and then \ndismantle its nuclear weapons program, and ultimately give up its \nnuclear weapon ambitions entirely. But what we do know is that \nwhen efforts are undertaken to quarantine, isolate, and cripple \nNorth Korea, both the Korean peninsula and the global nonprolif\xad\neration regime are put in jeopardy. The only antidote to the insid\xad\nious and corrosive conventional wisdom that Pyongyang will \nnever give up its nuclear weapons is for the United States, work\xad\ning in concert with Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing, to show initiative \nand leadership in improving relations with North Korea in a com\xad\nprehensive and determined fashion.\nThe sooner Obama overcomes the distracting, wishful think\xad\ning of contingency planning and instead swallows the bitter pill of \nhaving to deal directly with the DPRK government, the better. \nObama and his advisers were to some extent deceived by histori\xad\ncal contingencies in their first term. Kim Jong-il’s stroke in the \nsummer before they took office generated widespread speculation \nthat the DPRK might not survive the Dear Leader’s demise, which \nhelped justify a policy of strategic patience. Then in the ninth \ninning of initial dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang, \nKim died. This again revitalized talk of the coming collapse of \nNorth Korea during the power transition to Kim Jong-un, rein\xad\nforcing the argument that the failure of the Leap Day Deal was \nnot necessarily such a loss.\nProbably no regime in the world has been subjected to as \nmuch speculation on its imminent demise. Yet the Kim regime is \none of the longest-running continuous polities in East Asia. Wish\xad\ning it away does not solve the conundrum. In fact, disengagement \nby South Korea and the United States, often premised on the like\xad\nlihood of imminent collapse, only aggravates the problems and \nstrengthens North Korea’s most aggressive tendencies.\nAnother lesson to draw from the past four years is the critical \nrole of Seoul. The hard-line Lee administration benefited from a \none-year head start in rolling back inter-Korean engagement, pro\xad\nviding a quiet but powerful rationale for US disengagement. Given \nObama’s long list of more pressing foreign policy issues, it seemed\n', 'John Delury 177\nto make sense to follow his stalwart ally’s lead by deprioritizing \nNorth Korea and disengaging from Pyongyang. The steady deteri\xad\noration of the Korean peninsula security environment and episodic \ncrises along the demilitarized zone and NLL constrained the possi\xad\nbilities for successful US-DPRK dialogue. Ironically, Obama \nended up with a disengagement policy that was not only counter to \nUS interests; it was also rejected by the South Korean public. That \nmuch was evident from the December 2012 election for a new \nROK president, in which even the conservative candidate prom\xad\nised to moderate policies toward the North, reopen inter-Korean \nchannels, and hold a summit with Kim Jong-un (Yonhap 2012).\nIn his second term, Obama may have to decide between the \nprinciple of standing shoulder to shoulder with his South Korean \nally in the approach to North Korea, and the strategy of keeping \nPyongyang at arm’s length and tied down with draconian sanctions. \nThe potential for improvements in inter-Korean relations in the \nyears to come is the best hope for overcoming the pessimism in \nWashington and triggering a comprehensive North Korea policy \nreview. If South Korea restores its policy of political dialogue and \neconomic cooperation with the North, Seoul and Beijing will be \naligned and Washington will be the odd person out. The wiser \ncourse for Obama, should he wish to leave behind a record of \nprogress on the Korean peninsula, is to work closely and proac\xad\ntively with the new South Korean leader—as well as with the new \nChinese leadership—to engage Pyongyang’s young leader. Obama \nshould encourage the integration of the North Korean economy into \nthe dynamism of Northeast Asia while steadily working toward the \nultimate goal of denuclearization and peace on the peninsula.\nEngagement will not be easy. But making progress toward \ndenuclearization and peace by relying on disengagement and \nsanctions is impossible.\nNotes\nJohn Delury is assistant professor of East Asian studies at the Yonsei Uni\xad\nversity Graduate School of International Studies.

Bill Clinton created the post of special envoy for the Korean peace \ntalks, which the Bush administration rhetorically downgraded to special \nenvoy for negotiations with North Korea, and finally special envoy for the \nSix Party Talks. The Obama administration retained that position but never \nemployed it.\n2. Senior DPRK official comments to the author, Pyongyang, Septem\xad\nber 2010.\n3.
