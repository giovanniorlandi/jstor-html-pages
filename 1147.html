Bharathi*\nIt is the present trend that the number of women who prefer business as a carrier has significantly increased.\nThe special characteristics of women like looking at business problems contextually, viewing than issues wholly\nthen its parts are the requirements of the competitive world. Inspite of this the women entrepreneurs are\nprone to problems in their work culture. In this judicature empowering the women entrepreneurs is essential\nfor achieving the goals of sustainable development. It is also necessary to eradicate the bottlenecks that\naffect their growth and ensure their full participation in the business. So the present study pays attention on\nthe motivational factors, the level of satisfaction of the women entrepreneurs and the problems faced by them.\nIntroduction\nThe Indian traditional set up made a distinction\nbetween “Men’s” work and Women’s work,\nparticularly that of the women with family\nresponsibility. It curtailed the employment opportunity\nfor women in conventional and unconventional field\nof economic activity. Inspite of this, number of women\nlooking after business as a career has increased\nsignificantly over the past ten years. The technology\nchanges, globalization and competition acceleration\nmade the business world complex and dynamic. These\nfactors call for the importance of system thinking\nthat provides a framework for seeking the whole\npicture and interrelationships. The feminine property\nto look at business problems contextually and to\nconcentrate on the whole issue rather than its parts\nis more needed to the present system thinking of\ntoday. The business women can bring valuable\ninnovation to entrepreneurship because they weigh\nmore variables, consider more alternatives and\noutcomes, recall more points of view and see more\nways to proceed. Moreover, as the competition\nincreases, today’s entrepreneurs must be able to alter\nplans quickly and frequently. A women’s innate mental\nflexibility, their vision for long-term planning and the\nability to tolerate ambiguity and changes better than\nmen are a valuable asset for every venture and also\ntheir capacity to negotiate in marketing the product\nto prospective investors, suppliers and customers.\nThese are the present day requirements of the complex\nbusiness world.\nAsia-Pacific Business Review\nVol. V, No. 1, January - March 2009\npp. 105-113. ISSN: 0973-2470\n*Department of Management Studies and Research, Karpagam University, Echanari, Coimbatore – 641 021, Tamilnadu, India\n*E-Mail : bharathi7781@yahoo.co.in, bharathi7781@gmail.com\nAyadurai, Selvakumar and Sohail, M.Sadiq (1987)\ncarried out a case study on “the profile of women\nentrepreneurs in war-time area” in the North-East, Sri\nLanga by examining the demographic profile of\n“Tamil” women entrepreneurs who become\nentrepreneurs as a result of war. The study examined\nfive main areas – their characteristics, factors that\nspurred them into entrepreneurs, their challenges,\ntheir measures of success and their demographic\nprofile. The study revealed that majority of them\nwere in business for the first time as they lost their\nhusbands to the war and saw business as a means\nto end and their success in the venture is making a\nbalance between family and work. The studies\nconducted by Kale (1990) revealed that training\napproach is an important one for helping women in\nnon-traditional high skill, male dominated activities\nand also to build confidence among women to meet\nthe specific needs. Intensified effort has to be taken\nto asses the social attitude, mentality, needs and\nabilities of the women and impart training.  According\nto study conducted by Padmavati and Sathyasundram\n(2002) flexible training programme and interest based\nskill training can push the women towards\nentrepreneurial activities. Training to develop good\nmanagerial skills is useful and essential to women.\nParihar and Singh (2006) in their article explains the\nstudy on “Constraints faced by women entrepreneurs\nin Jammu” analysed the constrains faced by the\nwomen entrepreneurs in the state of Jammu. It was\nconducted on 240 respondents engaged in various\n', 'Vol. V, No. 1, January - March 2009Asia-Pacific Business Review\n106\nindustrial activities. The study suggested that the\nattitude of women entrepreneurs need to be reoriented\ntowards the promotion of leadership qualities. The\ngovernment has to take efforts to provided market\nassistance provision of land, create awareness of its\nschemes and assistance to women entrepreneurs.\nRajani N (2008) in her article in management training\nneeds of women entrepreneurs examines the quality\nof micro enterprise management by women in sociocultural\nmilieu and to project the management training\nneeds of women entrepreneurs. Data was collected\nfrom the sample of 100 women entrepreneurs. The\nstudy concluded that training needs are identified in\nthe area of confidence building, competence\nconnections and capital.\nIn the changed scenario, there is growing awareness\namong women that entrepreneurship opens up a new\nfield for them and they can achieve their cherished\nprofession which gives them independence and self\nsupport. In order to succeed in their venture of\nentrepreneurship, they must recognize the fact of\nadvantages they have and the unique challenges\nthat they have to face than their male counterparts.\nThe knowledge of the problems they face, their level\nof satisfaction towards motivated factors enables\nthem to exploit their strengths and unique differences\nas advantages. It also acts as a facilitator for future\nentrepreneurs and encourages prospective women\nentrepreneurs to venture into the field of business.\nIn this concept, a profile of women entrepreneur in\nthe Western region of Tamilnadu throws light on\nthem as entrepreneurs in the business. Hence, the\npresent study is undertaken with the following\nobjectives:\n• To study the socio economic background of the\nwomen entrepreneurs.\n• To analyze the multinational factors that led them\nto become entrepreneurs and their level of\nsatisfaction.\n• To assess the problem faced by the women\nentrepreneurs.\n• To offer suggestion on the basis of the present\nstudy.\nResearch Methodology\nThe paper studies the satisfaction and problem of\nwomen entrepreneurs of Western Region (Coimbatore,\nErode, Ooty and Tirupur) of Tamilnadu. The study\ncovers 100 women entrepreneurs in and around\nWestern Region using random sampling method. The\nstudy depends on primary data collected with the\nhelp of a questionnaire consisting of personal factors\nand factors that determine the extent of entrepreneur’s\nsatisfaction and problems. The questionnaire is\ndistributed directly to the respondents by explaining\nthe purpose of the study. In order to maintain\naccuracy, the respondents in different places of\nWestern region and engaged in different\nentrepreneurship activities are selected. The data was\nstatistically analysed in order to ensure accuracy as\nthe data obtained was random based on age, gender\nand other parameters. The result of the analysis is\npresented in form of tables as given in the following\npages. In order to determine the parameters that\ninfluence the satisfaction and problem of women\nentrepreneurs, it is important to reduce the relevant\nparameters so that there is a limited set of parameters\nrepresenting the total set. To suit this, chi-square\nand factor analysis are used.\nAnalysis and Interpretation of Data\nThe socio-economic profile presents an overview of\nthe responses which is more important for the analysis\nthe data. The details of socio-economic profile in\ngiven in Table 1. To assess the level of satisfaction\nof women entrepreneurs from the motivational factors\nfor their careers, 5 variables were identified. They are\n(i) assistance given by financial institutions, (ii) help\nextended by women’s association, (iii) infrastructural\nfacilities provided by the government, (iv) financial\nassistance provided by the government (v) marketing\nassistance provided by the government. Each item\nwas rated on a 5 point scale consisting of rating as\nhighly satisfied (5), satisfied (4), undecided (3),\ndissatisfied (2) and highly dissatisfied (1). In order to\nconvert the qualitative information into quantitative\ninformation, the respondents are classified on the\nbasis of the motivational scores as given in Table 2.\nTable 3 presents the extent of variation in the level\nof satisfaction derived by women entrepreneurs from\nthe assistances provided by the financial institution\non the basis of their motivational scores.\n', '© Asia-Pacific Institute of Management, New Delhi\n107\nTable 1: Socio-Economic Profile of Entrepreneurs\nVariable\nAge\nEducational Qualification\nAnnual Income\nExperience\nMarital Status\nNature of Family\nFamily Member\nProfile\nLess than 20 years\n20-30 years\n30-40 years\nAbove 40 years\nUp to HSC\nDegree\nDiploma\nProfessional\nBelow Rs.1,00,000\nRs.1,00,000 to Rs.2,00,000\nRs.2,00,000 to 4,00,000\nAbove Rs.4,00,000\nBelow 5 years\n6-10 years\n10-15 years\n15 & above\nMarried\nUnmarried\nBusiness Background\nNon-Business Background\nUp to 2\n3-5\n5 & above\nNo. of Respondents\n4\n19\n49\n28\n24\n38\n6\n32\n9\n32\n37\n22\n28\n35\n25\n12\n80\n20\n60\n40\n8\n77\n15\nPercentage\n4.0\n19.0\n49.0\n28.0\n24.0\n38.0\n6.0\n32.0\n9.0\n32.0\n37.0\n22.0\n28.0\n35.0\n25.0\n12.0\n80.0\n20.0\n60.0\n40.0\n8.0\n77.0\n15.0\nTable 2: Motivational Score\nLevel of Motivational Score No. of Entrepreneurs Percentage\nLess 38 38.00\nMedium 36 36.00\nHigh 26 26.00\nTotal 100 100\nSource: Primary Data\nSource: Survey Data\n', 'Vol. V, No. 1, January - March 2009Asia-Pacific Business Review\n108\nHence, it can be inferred that more number of\nrespondents with high motivational score and less\nnumber of respondents with low motivational score\nhave strongly agreed and strongly disagreed\nrespectively with the factor that motivated them. The\nextent of level of satisfaction derived by the\nrespondents from the factor help extended by the\nwomen’s association is shown in Table 4. It is\nconcluded that majority of the respondents have\ndisagreed to the motivational factor. The extent of\nvariation in the level of satisfaction derived by women\nentrepreneurs from the motivational factor assistances\nprovided by the government is shown in Table 5. It\ncan be inferred from Table 5 that majority of the\nrespondents with high motivational score have agreed\nand strongly agreed to the factor. The extent of\nvariation in the level of satisfaction derived by the\nrespondents from the marketing assistance provided\nto them is presented in Table 6. It is concluded that\nthe marketing assistance provided did not attract the\nwomen entrepreneurs. The extent of level of\nsatisfaction derived by the respondents from the\ninfrastructural facilities is shown in Table 7.

The Total Variable\nExplained suggested that it extracts three factor\naccounts for 46.842 percent of the variance of\nrelationship between variables. There are only three\nfactors, each having Eigen value exceeding 1 for\nbarriers. The Eigen values for three factors were 1.533,\n1.350, and 1.332 respectively as per Table 11. The\npercentage of total variance is used as an index to\ndetermine how well the total factor solution accounts\nfor the related of the variables. The index for present\nsolution accounts for 46.842 percent of the total\nvariation for choosing barriers of women’s\nentrepreneurs. It is pretty good extraction as it can\neconomize on the number of factors (from nine it has\nreduced to three factors) while we have lost 53.158\npercent information content for factors in choosing\nthe barriers. The percentage of variance explained by\nfactors one to three is 17.039, 15.000 and 14.803\nrespectively as in Table 11. Large communalities\nindicate that a large number of variance has been\naccounted for by the factor solution. Varimax related\nfactor analytical results for factor influencing the\nchoice of barriers is shown in Table 12. The three\ndimensions shown in Table 12 have been discussed\nbelow:\nFactor 1:\nLack of entrepreneurship quality: The significant\nloadings on this factor include variables of lack of\nentrepreneurship graduates which includes lack of\nrole models, lack of business skill and low need of\nachievement. We can level this factor as lack of\nentrepreneurship quality. It tries to insist on the\nimportance of qualities required for entrepreneurship\nand enable to concentrate on these areas for the\ndevelopment of entrepreneurship.\nFactor 2:\nInadequate facilities and lack of experience: This\nfactor shows the significant loading of inadequate\nsupport facilities and experience covering inadequate\nfamily support, absence of management experience\nand in sufficient supply of capital. These variables\nsuggest that their presence is most important for the\nindicators of entrepreneurship activities.\nFactor 3:\nLack of personal qualities and inadequate support\nof financial institutions: This factor includes the\npresent qualities which are the basis for\nentrepreneurship activities can be named as lack of\npersonal qualities and inadequate support of financial\ninstitutions. This includes lack of educational\nqualification, low esteem and insufficient support of\nfinancial institutions.\nTable 10: KMO and Bartlett’s Test\nKaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of\nSampling Adequacy. .696\nBartlett’s Test of Approx. 45.389\nSphericity Chi-Square\ndf 36\nSig. .000\n', 'Vol. V, No. 1, January - March 2009Asia-Pacific Business Review\n112\nTable 11: Total Variance Explained\nExtraction Method: Principal Component Analysis.\nComponent Initial Eigen values Extraction Sums of Squared Rotation Sums of Squared\nLoadings Loadings\nTotal % of % Total % of % Total % of %\nVariance Cumulative Variance Cumulative Variance Cumulative\n1 1.533 17.039 17.039 1.533 17.039 17.039 1.512 16.799 16.799\n2 1.350 15.000 32.039 1.350 15.000 32.039 1.354 15.047 31.846\n3 1.332 14.803 46.842 1.332 14.803 46.842 1.350 14.996 46.842\n4 0.982 10.909 57.751\n5 0.963 10.704 68.455\n6 0.874 9.716 78.171\n7 0.778 8.648 86.819\n8 0.640 7.116 93.935\n9 0.546 6.065 100.00\nTable 12: Name of the Factors\nNaming of\nFactors\nF1\nF2\nF3\nName of the\nDimensions\nLack of\nEntrepreneurship\nquality\nInadequate facilities\nand lack\nof experience\nLack of personal\nqualities and\ninadequate financial\ninstitutions\nLabel\nLoading\nX2\nX4\nX6\nX3\nX5\nX9\nX1\nX7\nX8\nName of the Problems\nLack of role models\nLack of Business Skill\nLow need of achievement\nInadequate family support\nAbsence of sufficient management experience\nInadequate supply of capital\nLack of educational qualification\nLow self esteem\nInsufficient financial Institutions\nFactor\n0.632\n0.717\n0.677\n0.698\n0.679\n0.745\n0.690\n0.673\n0.640\n', '© Asia-Pacific Institute of Management, New Delhi\n113\nConclusion\nThe study has brought out the extent of satisfactions\nlevel of the women entrepreneurs towards the\nmotivational factors.
