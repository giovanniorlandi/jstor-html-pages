Y. T., L. W. Gideon Carcross, Y. T., E. L Pilmsn Atlln, B. C., REPUBLICAN TICKET—First Division, V°le tIve Ticket straight:, Delegate to Congress—Dan Sutherland, of Juneau., Senator—Frank A. Aldrich, of Juneau., Representative—H. R. Sheppard, of Juneau., William D. Grant, of Wrangell., l ash Cole, of Juneau., E. M. Polley, of iitka., Road Commissioner—Joseph w\'"cer, of Ketchikan., THE COMING ELECTION*, Every Republican ahould be Interested in the candidate* who are ask, ing for their suffrages in the coming election on Nov \\ i\'lio candidate, aie from Juneau. Sitka and Wrangell. Cash Cole has had the experience, of one term in the legislature, is well known and much respected for his, abilities and gifts. E. M. Polley of Sltk.i ufls all the requisiie.1 ror a cred, itable record in the legislature Mr. H. R. Sheppard. and William D., liraut from Juneau and Wrangell. respectively, are well known in the fiist, Mvlslon and merit the earnest support of every Republican la that sec, t on. They should be elected this year. Frank A. Aldrich has six years of, service to his credit and the territory\'s benefit. He is familiar with the, needs jf the territory and has made good in his previous terms of service. |, Heading the whole ticket is the name of Dan Sutherland for Delegate, from Alaska to Congress. No man or woman in the territory will make, any mistake as to doing that which is best for the lertitory by commit- I, ting to these men the offices for which they have been nominated. j, THE NEED OF WOMEN JURORS IN ALASKA, Every time the District Court is held in Juneau considerable difficulty, experienced in securing enough Jurors to do the business of the court., Special venires are most frequent. And we presume that other divlsl»:i9, have a similar experience. For several years past tnere has been ,tn In, clination to pass a lew that will give the women the sai>.» opportunity as, tae aien to earn $5 per day by serving their country. An argument, how, ever. has always been put forth that the women don\'t nanr this privilege,, la order to test the matter the last legislature passed an act to provide for, an °xpresslon by the female voters of the Territory for their desire for the, enactment of a law imposing upon them the same duty to serve us juro:*, u* is now Imposed on men. As a result the women will have a separate, aid extra ballot to vote on November 7, and they will place a cross for or, against a law requiring women to Berve as jurors. In the event that a ma, jority teclare in favor of such a law It will be the duty of the Legislature, : tat convenes next March to pasa an act appropriately expressing the wish, of the electors. The women of Alaska have demonstrated that they well, know how to use the ballot and it is safe to assume that a majority will de, clare for the exercise by tbelr sex of the right to sit on juries. Where, they have had this power or privilege women have in many cases been ac, cepted in preference to men. In the courts at Seattle it is not unusual to, *ee six. seven or eight women on a jury. Most lawyers think that they got, more just verdicts from women.—Juneau Capital., BOYCOTT ACTION IS RIGHTLY REBUKED, Every now and then the Cordova Chamber of Commerce take on an, air of Independence that is quite refreshing. The other evening, by res, olution, it unqualifiedly condemned the action of the City Council for or, dering fir planking from Seattle for $45 per M. feet when It was ofTsred by, a sa» mill company of the town spruce lumber for from $30 to $35 per M., And ihe funny part of It all is that the noted statesman, Thomas J Dono, hoe. Democratic National Committeeman, is leading member of Coun, cil who insisted upon making the purchase at Seattle. And all tor the, reason that the manager of the mill Is "uncontrollable." Tom\'s tactics, might go all right in Juneau, but they are evidently getting tired of that, stud in Cordova.—Juneau Capital., LA N K M LETTERS, CAUSE COMMENT, New York. Oct. 27.—Former Sec, retary of Commerce Redtield, who, sat next to Franklin Lane at Wil, son\'s Cabinet table, expressed his, opinion that the letters of the for, mer Secretary of the Interior, now, published In book form, do not rep, resent Lane\'s mature judgment., Redfield said Lane was overworked, and ill at the time the letters were, wriuea,, ALASKA SEAL SKIXS, SOl\'TH FOB SEATTLE, Seattle, Oct. 27.—Steamship, Brookdale has arrived with 26,000, steal skins taken during the past sum, mer on the Pribilof Islands.
