It arose over the\nMovius resubmission bill and while it\n•lid not last as long as was expected,\nit was warm while it lasted In the\nend the resubmissionists carried their\npoint and deferred the cor. ideration\nof the committee report on the Movius\nbjll until next week, which was their\nobject in making the light. A test\nvote on the matter showed a strength\nof 02 for the prohibition side of the\ncontroversy to 32 for the resubmission\nend of the light, with six members ab\xad\nsent and not voting.\nNo other business was transacted by\nthe house than the attempted consider\xad\nation of the report on (he resubmis\xad\nsion bill. This was a majority and\nminority report, the majority, headed\nby Chairman MeCrea and consisting\nof seven members of ti committee,\nrecommended the indefnite postpone\xad\nment of the bill. The minority report,\nsigned by Messrs. Llsh and Lyons,\nrecommended the passaee of the bill.\nThe battle was on from the time the\nreport of the committee was presented.\nRepresentative Lyons charged that the\nmajority report had been changed\nwithout the knowledge of the minority.\nHe said that the majority of the com\xad\nmittee had agreed to recommend that\nthe bill do not pass. Instead of that\nreport, a report for indefinite post\xad\nponement was brought in. Mr. Me\xad\nCrea stated that the report of the com\xad\nmittee was as agreed upon at the\nmeeting held yesterday morning.\nA motion to adopt the majority re\xad\nport of the committee which would\nhave killed the resubmission bill,\nbrought forth a demand from the re\xad\nsubmissionists for a cal! of the house,\nwhich was aequiesed in by lie neces\xad\nsary twenty-one member-, of the house.\nThe doors were secured and the roll\ncall began. Two members of the\nhouse were found absent and unex\neused. Messrs. Miller and Movius.\nMr. McGahan moved that the ser\xad\ngeant at arms be directed to bring the\nabsentees to the bar of the house.\nMr. Leech moved that further proceed\xad\nings under the call be dispensed with.\nMr. McCJahan made a point of order\nand declared that there were twenty\none members who would immediately\nrepeat the demand for a call of the\nhouse. The chair declared the point\nof order not well taken and enter\xad\ntained the motion for dispensing "with\nthe proceedings under the call. The\nroll call showed the strength of the\nopposing sides, sixty-two members vot\xad\ning to dispense with the proceedings,\nthirty-two voting against and six mem\xad\nbers not voting.\nThe resubmission sta\'warts who op\xad\nposed the motion to dispense with pro\xad\nceedings under the call were the fol\xad\nlowing:\nBaiter of Ramsey. Bartz. Beck. Bos\ntrom. Botirassa. Brown Connolly. Die\nball. Fried. Gagnon, Hammer. Hanson,\nHarvey. Knudtson. Lyons, Mattson.\nMcClure. McGahan. McKen/.ie. Meld\ninger.

Watson,\nMiller and Movius.\nUpon the declaration that the pro\xad\nceedings under the ca\'l were dis\xad\npensed with the demand for a call\nof the house was repeated. Davis of\nRamsey moved to ad\'ourn and the\nhouse adjourned by a viva voce vote,\nending the consideration of the resub\xad\nmission matter for the day.\nThere was a lively interest mani\xad\nfested in the fight, and when news of\nIts progress reached the senate that\nbody recessed and members crowded\ninto the house gallery to watch the\nproceedings. Thev were disappointed\nIn the extent of the battle, ns the re\nsuhnifssionists had (\'.-elated they\nwould block all procee lings in the\nhouse rather than have the measure\ndisposed of at yesterday session.\nThev asked for its postponement until\nnext week, their desire being to defer I\nconsideration in the house itnfil after!\nthe measure had been hi ought iu from\nthe senate committee niid arte\') upon\nthere.

If this is done, there will\ndoubtless be another m°rry scrap.\nSome of the prohibitionists say their\ngeneralship was bad yesterday and\nthat they might, had ihey remained\none or two more roll ctlls. have dis\xad\nposed of the mat*«r.

CHAMBERLAIN REJECTS AN\nADDRESS FROM CHRISTIAN\nOEWET\'S PARTY.\nREBUKES THE DELEGATES\nColonial Secretary Regard* the Doc\xad\nument a# Insulting—Dewet Refers to\nHis Brother and Botha as Scoun\xad\ndrels, and Accuses the Government\nof Contravening the Terms of Ver.\neeniging Agreement.\nBloemfontein, Feb. 7.—Colonial Sec\xad\nretary Chamberlain during the day\nhad a two hours\' conference with a\ndeputation of about forty Boers of the\nExtreme party, including Christian\nDewet. The deputation presented an\naddress which, it is understood, Mr.\nChamberlain rejected, at the same\ntime rebuking the delegates for pre\xad\nsenting the address, which he regarded\nas insulting, inasmuch as it impugned\nthe good faith of himself and the gov\xad\nernment.\nChristian Dewet, who referred to\nPiet Dewet and Chris Botha as scoun\xad\ndrels, accused tbe government of con\xad\ntravening the terms of the Vereeniging\nagreement, especially as regards the\namnesty, and he requested that the\nterms of peace should be incorporated\nin a law.\nThe feuds between the Boer parties\n"have become so strong, particularly\nbetween the brothers, Christian -and\nPiet Dewet, that Mr. Chamberlain\nmay well be in doubt as to who really\nrepresents the people of the Orange\nRiver Colony. Piet Dewet, who has\nbeen appointed a justice of the peace,\nheaded a deputation of loyalist Boers\nto the colonial secretary. Christian\nDewet holds steadily aloof from the\nloyalist section and until now had\nmade excuses and absented himself\nfrom all the functions connected with\nMr. Chamberlain\'s visit. He is cred\xad\nited with wanting to tear up the Ver\xad\neeniging treaty and begin afresh.\nBOMBARDED WITH 8T0NES.\nStreet Cars in Waterbury, Conn., Dam\xad\naged by Mobs.\nWaterbury.

Mr. Morgan spoke on\nhis resolution calling on the secretary\nof the navy for correspondence regard\nlag the military occupation of the bays\nof Panama and Colon. He had not\nproceeded far, however, when Mr. Cul\nlom, who had been following him\nclosely, interrupted with a motion for\nan executive session, which Mr. Mor\xad\ngan resisted. The chair overruled\nMr. Morgan\'8 objections and the doors\nwere closed.\nMr. Morgan continued his remarks\nin executive session, alleging that\n11.000,000 which the United States\npaid to Colombia would go to the in\xad\nsurgents who made peace last year.\nWhen the open session was resumed,\nMr. Morgan predicted that if the\nUnited States continued its policy\nwith reference to the construction of\nan isthmian canal, war with Colombia\nwas inevitable.\nAfter Mr. Kean had spoken a short\ntime in opposition\'to the statehood bill,\nthe senate adjourned out of respect to\nthe memory of the late Representative\nMoody of North Carolina.\nGENERAL DEBATE CLOSES.\nHouse Nearly Ready to Vote on the\nAnti-Trust Bill.\nWashington.

Coleman, Hon. Leland Stanford, H. J.\nBooth, Alexander Weill, Abraham Seligmann, Charles Crocker, C. C. Hopkins, L. Gottig and others.\nThe "Union" in 1870,1871 and 1872 located over 3,000 settlers upon government homestead lands, and\nassisted in locating the "RIVERSIDE" Colony, "PASADENA," "ONTARIO," "POMONA." "REDLANDS,"\n"LOMPOC COLONY," in Santa Barbara County "THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COLONY" at Fresno,\nand other well known colonies.\nThe success in settling these well known colonies in which we have been engaged since 1870 will be\na guarantee that our services can be duplicated in any future colony enterprise we undertake.\nVery few of these settlers who located at RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA, commenced life there with\nmore thau 81,000, yet in 1895 RIVERSIDE was rated by BRADSTREET\'S COMMERCIAL AGENCY at\nan average of §12,000 to EACH FAMILY. Since then there has been a steady increase of population each\nsucceeding year.\nThe next colony tract we shall offer the public is located in CHOLAME VALLEY, north of Santa\nBarbara, containing 40,000 acres—one of the most beautiful locations in California, near railroad and\nsteamship communication. This tract will soon be ready.\n300,000 Acres in Colombia, South America\nying on the east bank of the Magdalena river, about 500 miles from the coast. It is about 1,000 feet above\nhe level of the sea, and has a frontage on the river of about 25 miles.\nThis property will, be divided into 20, 40, 80 and 100-acre farms, and sold to the first 500 settlers at Si\nper acre, payable II p.r acre cash, and 91 per acre in four equal annual payments, without interest.\nThe climate, soil and productions are tbe same as Southern California, including Tropical Fruits, such\nas Oranges, Lemons, Limes, Grape Fruit, Pine Apples, Grapes, Cocoa and Rubber Trees, Ginseng Root,\nTobacco, etc.\nTIMBER •—In addition to the agricultural products mentioned, we have thousands of acres of all\nvarieties of hard wood timber, such asmohogany, Lignum Vitae, Oak, Spanish Cedar, Ash, Laurel, Redwood\n—suitable for cabinet work. Also Cinchona Copa«ia, Sarsaparilla, Cinnamon, Cloves, Arrow Root, Ginger\nRoot and Ginseng Root grow spontaneously.\nMANUFACTURING •—We are prepared to assist and encourage any desirable manufacturing busi\xad\nness that may seek an opening in our colony. We intend that it shall be an INDUSTRIAL COLONY,\nwhere we will have the following Carriage and wagon factory, blacksmith shops, furniture factory, cigar\nfactory, box factory, shoe factory, ice factory and *\'-•-trie pincl, agricultural implement works, iron foundry,\nmining machinery, flour and grist mill, saw mills, and other industries will follow. A fine large saw mill is\nto be in running order April 1, 1903.\nWe are offering no stock for sale in our company—.to any but actual settlers the stock is $10 per share,\neach share exchangable for two acres of land.

They coined immense quan\xad\ntities of the precious metals and used\nto make pieces of workmanship in\nthem for exportation. The very sol\xad\ndiers euriebed themselves by com\xad\nmerce.\nRut then at last came the inquisition,\nwhich celebrated its terrible and deadly\nrites with more fervor und vehemence\nat Gou than in any other place. Reli\xad\ngious persecution, pestilence and wars\nwith the Dutch, disturbances arising\nfrom an unsettled government, and,\nabove all. the slow but sure workings\nof the shortsighted policy of the Portu\xad\nguese In intermarrying and identifying\nthemselves with the Hindoos of the\nlowest caste, made her fall ns rapid aa\nher rise was sudden and prodigious.\nIn less thau a century and a half aft\xad\ner ln ama had lauded on the Indian\nshore the splendor of Goa had departed\nforever. The inhabitants fled before\nthe deadly fever which soon fastened\nii1om the devoted precincts of the city,\nand in 1 T.\'S the viceroy transferred his\nliend|tiiirtcrs from the ancient capital\nto Tarjlna, aliout eight miles distant\nSoon afterward the religious orders\nwere expelled, leaving tlieir magnifi\xad\ncent convents and churches all but ut\xad\nterly deserted, and the inquisition was\nsuppressed upon the recommendation\nof the Itritish government.\nThe place is now a ^rass grown wil\xad\nderness. Hut still the tirm and well\nbuilt causeways of this olden city aud\nits moldcring splendors are reminiscent\nof eehoiug pageants and the tramp of\narmies which once sounded there. As\nwe tread the ancient wharf, a long,\nbroad road, lined with a double row of\ntrees and faced with stone, a more sug\xad\ngestive scene of desolation can hardly\nbe conceived. Everything around teeuis\nwith melancholy associations, the very\nrustlings of the trees and murmur of\nthe waves sound like a dirge for lha de\xad\nparted jrrandeur of a city.\nTowering above a mass of rulas S\nsolitary gateway flanks tbe entrance\nto the Strada Diretta, the Straight\nstreet, so called because almost all tbe\nstreets in old Goa are laid out in cur\xad\nvilinear form.

Groves of eocoanut palms\nand m:ni£o topes now incumber the\nKrouud once covered by troops of horse.\nThe wealth, the busy life and the lux\xad\nury of the old place are dead. Kites\naud cobras infest the crumbling halls\nwhich once resounded with the ban\nquet and the dance, and naught but a\nfew old monks and nuns keeps vigil\namid its desolation today.\nBut Goa possesses one treasure of\ngreat interest. This is the tomb of\nFrancis Xavier. the great Jesuit mis\xad\nsionary to the east. It is to be found in\nthe Church of Bon Jesus. It is a mas\xad\nterpiece of art which is lost to all but\nthe casual visitors to old Goa. Some\nhave ventured to suggest that 110 oilier\nmausoleum In India or even in Asia ex\xad\ncept the Taj Mahal can equal it. It is\nbuilt of rich marble of variegated col\xad\nors.
