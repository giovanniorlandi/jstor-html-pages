Canal Rights\n; and Send Uncle Sain Into War\nWith the Mikado.\nWhen the iAmericah Secretary of\nSt?te\'?flfcf?Ry. kicked: out the"^laya?*\nenvoy tsp?r Washington, but permit\nted j?m to remain in - the capital\ncitr as an "unofficial" means . of\n^communication between the Nicara\nguan and American governments, he\nalso made it. know that he would\nreceive "unofficial"- information from\nNicaragua through Dr. Salvador\nCastrilla, the representative in Wash\nington of the Estrade, or revolution\nary party, in Nicaragua. ?\nJust in how \'far Castrilla has con\nferred with.. and poster. Mr.. ..Knox\nwe are not to know, says the Augus\nta Chonicle. But if Dr. Castrilla,\ntalks as volubly and foolishly to the\n\' American State Department as he\ndoes to the American newspapers,\nhe is a pretty "warm number," as\none of the Washington newsboys\nwould put it.\nIn a recent issue of the New. York\n. Herald,- Dr. Castrilla attempted to\nconfirm to the American.. public AiXi\n? the terrible things which Mr. Knox\nhas alleged against Zelaya and a\ngreat deal more. But, in his zeal to\nshow what an awful man Zelaya .is\ncajpable., he shows himself so, igno^\nrant that if he does no; lose his\n"unofficial" head, he certainly ought\nto. But read what he says:\n"The plan is now for Zelaya to\nuse every means in his power to\ninjure Americans," Dr. Castrilla\nsaid, "and if he is defeated he will\nleave for Antwerpt, where his wiife\nnow awaits him. Zelaya has gc\ncl?red to his confidential advisors\nhis intention to fight. But first he\nwill make a determined effort to\ninterest the American Congress\nagainst the State Department, and\nalso to seek to enlist the services\no!*. Japan against. the United States.\n"Senor \'Cored, formerly Minister\nof Zelaya to the United States, is\nhere in Washington now, and I know\npositively that he has in his trunk\ncredentials to the Japanese to mak\'i\nciu alliance with Japan Emperor.\nStrange as it may seem, Zelaya seems\nto think he can, against the United\nStates. He first conceived the idea\nin 2397, and has been brooding over\nthe plan for some time.\n"The details of the Zelayan plan\nshbw that Zelaya is willing to prom\nise to Japan a canal in Nicaragua\nand will also pledge himself to de\n. stroy the Panama Canal if Japan\nso desires. Of course, the idea is\nridiculous, but it shows to what\nZelaya and his advisors scheme to\ndo.\n"The confidential agents- of Ze\nlaya are spurring him on to fight,\ntelling him that the American peo\nple will admire his courage and that\nbe will come out well in the end.\nFirst they have advised him to ad\ndress the American House of Rep\nresentatives, setting forth bis case\nand asking that the government stop\nproceeding against him."\nAll this is too bad. Just as we\nwere all \' congratulating ourselves\nthat the great canal would be open\ned on time . and complimenting our\ncountry th3t we were at peace with\nall the world, except Zelay, here\nccmes \' along the re-opening of the\nHobson war and the destruction of\nthe great waterway on which we have\nseen our Roosevelts and our Taf\'.s\nand\'our Goethals work so hard. It\nis awful to contemplate.\nThere is necessity for American\ninterference In this Nlcaraguan af\nfair. That is now apparent. If\nCastrilla i9 a fair sample of the j>eo\nple they have down there, if be\nis the be3t of the diplomats that can\nt>e gotten out of the little repub\nlic, Mr. Knox might feel impelled\nto appoint a guardian for the whole\nNicaraguan country, at least until\nhe could send missionaries there for\nsuch a time as would be necessary\nto drum a little sense into the peo\nple there. . ?\nZelaya may be as bad as Knox\npaints him. It looks like be is.\nAnd, as bad as he is, if he is as big\na fool as Castrilla?if he combines\nthe Zalaya wickedness with the Cas\ntrilla ignorance?it will take all the\njoined force of the United States to\nhandle him.\nIt looks like the whole Castrilla,\nEstrada, Zelaya & Co. bunch should\nbe given a severe spanking and be\nput to bed. They certainly appear\nto be an ignorant and simple lot,\nwith just enough meanness in them\n.to nequire itbat they be watched\nto prevent them from doing harm\nto others and to themselves. Mun\nchausen was a child at his art as\ncompared with Castrilla. *\nDynamite Exploded.\nAt St. Paul, Minn., on Saturday,\none man was killed and two others\nare so badly injured that they will\ndie. as a result of two cars of" dy\nnamite exploding at the Minnesota\ntransfer. The cars are so complete\nly demolished it is impossible to\nascertain what road they belonged\nCOTTON MOUNTS UPWARD\nGOVERNMENT CROP REPORT\nSENDS PRICES SOARING.\nEstimate That Crop Would Barely\n.

Not Bince the Sully boom of 1904\n?has the" New\'"York Cotton Exchange\nwitnessed a more sensational scene\nor a more spectacular rise la prices\nthan occurred Friday with the an\nnouncement of the government crop\nreport With the galleries crowded\nwith visitors from the South, aug\nmented*-by-friends and relatives of\noperators and other interested spec\ntators, the market soared to a new\nhigh record for the season with gains\nof more than $2 a bale over Th?rs\nday. Both the May and July options\ntouched tho high mark.-of 15.80,\nboth gaining approximately 42 points\nover Thursday\'6 closing. \' \' \\ c\nBull brokers prevented a more vio\nlent advance, as they bad distribut\ned heavy selling orders every five\npoints up from 15.55 for May and\nJuly. They sold enormously, supply\ning the demand of shorts and also\nthe inrush of buying orders from\nWall street Chicago and Southern\noperators and the local and New\nEngland dry goods interests. The\nmarket continued in an excited state\nup to tho close, with estimates that\nfive hundred -thousand hales had\nchanged hands, in the last hour.\nMay closed at 15.67 and ;July at\n15.74.\nIt was 2 o\'clock when the news\nreached New York, from Washington\nthat the government estimate was\nonly 10;088,000 bales, the smallest\ncrop since 1903. Immediately there\nwas a tremendous rush of buying.\nOrders poured in from the world over\nand prices jumped from 2u to 30\npoints on the first transactions. Last\ntrades made just before the report\nwas announced were on the basis of\n15.50 for May delivery; the next\nsales were made at 15.70, an advance\nof $1 a bale. This was followed by\ntremendous trading both ways, and\nby rapid fluctuations. A br^jk to\n15.65 followed, then came the rise\nto 15.80. July cotton . fluctuated\nalong the same lines,- while March\nreached 15.CO as lts high po\'nt and\nUOfiea St 15.40.\n? Tho government estimate is about\n200,000 bales below the prediction\nof the most sanguine of the bulls\nand the action of the market natur\nally followed. 8ixteen-cent cotton,\nso much talked about, was not realiz\ned, but the market came near it\nIt now remains to be determined\nwhether the Federal estimates have\nunder-estimated the yields, as has\nbeen the case for the past ten years. I\nDuring that time the crop has been\nunder-estimated each year . at from!\n500,000 to 600,000 bales.\nNew Orleans Marftct.\nAt New Orleans, following the\nposting of the cotton crop report\nestimate of 10.088.000 bales on the\nCotton Exchange Friday afternoon,\nthe future market took a jump which\nranged from 25 to 40 points. May\ncotton went %o ?slxteen cents, es\ntablishing a new high record for\nthe season. The estimate was about\n200.000 bales below the prediction\nof the most sanguine bulls. ?\nAnticipating a bullish, estimate,\nthe trade started the market toward\nhigher levels several, days ago, and\nthe May option Friday sold at 15.54,\n4 -points above the high price of\nthe day before. Yet it was even\nthen far below the level which was\naccorded it Friday, when it broke all\nrecords for the season by going to\n16 cents.\nA majority of the operators had\nbeen trading on the belief that\nFriday\'s estimates would be between\n10.300.000 and 10,600,000 bales.\nWhen an estimate of 10,088.000\nbales was put out, a small panic en\nsued and the market went up with a\njump.\nThe Crop Report.\nThe crop reporting board of the\ndepartment of ngriculture estimattd\nthat the total production of cotton\nIn the United States for the season\nof 1509-10 will amount to 4.S26,\n344,000 pounds (not Including Unt\ners), equivalent to 10.0S8.000 bales\nof 500 pounds gross weight.\nThe estimated production in 500\npound gross weight bales by States\nis as follows:\nVirginia, 10,000; North Carolina,\n615.000; South Carolina. 1.095,000;\nGeorgia, 1.800,000; Florida. 57.0C0;\nAlabama. 1.020.000; Mississippi,\n1,021.000; Louisiana. 280,000; Tex\nas. 2.570,000; Arkansas, 715,000;\nTennessee. 240.000: Missouri, 49,\n000; Oklahoma. 617,000; United\nStates. 10.088.000. *\nDutch Count Got to John D.\nCount P. A. de Vries was success\nful this past week in reaching John\nD. Rockefeller at his home in Forest\nHill, near Cleveland, O. The count\nsought to interest the financier in\nhis scheme to drain the Zyder Zee,\nHolland, and open It to trucking.\nHe had tried frequently to meet\nJohn D., and once was fired upon\nwhen he persisted too strongly. 8\nThree Men Suffocated.\nThree men died of suffcation, 21\nothers were overcome and rescued\nwith difficulty, as the result of a fire\nin the Shoemaker at Johnson, Pa.,\non Saturday morning. *\nORANGEB?B\n"WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC\nREVOLTING FEATURES OF IMMI\nGRATION REPOICT.\nBusiness Bas Assumed Enormous\nPropotkm and Has Been Exerting\nan EV11 Influence on Country.\nStories of the revolting practices\nof the\' procurers or women fof im\nportation into the United States for\nimmoral purposes are told in a re\nport issued by the immigration com\nmission. The recommendation of tlur\ncommission contemplate a closer\nscrutiny for the admission of alien\nwomen and renewed efforts to stamp\nout the so-called "white slave traf\nfic."\nThe commission says that the\n"white slave traffic" is the most piti\nful and revolting phase of the im\nmigration question. The business\nhas assumed large proportions and\nhas been exerting an evil influence\nupon the country.\nThe statement of the commission\nmay form a basis for reasonable leg\nislation and administrative action to\nlessen the evils.\nThe inquiry covered the cities of\nNew York, Chicago, San Francisco,\nSeattle, Portland, Sale Lake, Ogden,.\nButte, Denver, Buffalo, Boston and\nNew Orleans.\nThe report deals with the methods\nused by the men and women procur\ners to lure the women into this\ncountry for immoral purposes, j The\nmethods differ In the different coun\ntries. In some countries the men\nand women in the business of entic\ning innocent girls to the United\nStates resort to proffers of attractive\npositions. In many cases the men\noffer themselves in marriage and\nfrequently risk prosecution for big\namy in order to obtain their desires.\nConcerning the talk of a monopo\nlistic corporation whose business is\nto import unfortunate women, the\n[ commission declares that it is unable\nto learn of the existauce of such a\ncorporation.\nUnder the head of "recommenda\ntions" the commission states that\nowing to the difference between\nAmerican and European views\'.re\ngarding orosjftution, there can be but\na limited co-operation with some pf\nthe European na^ons In the fight\nto suppress the white slave trade\nand that largely the United States\nmu6t rely upon its own officials\' to\nwipe out the practice. The commis\nsion Bubmits the suggestion of the\nadministrative changes and a more\nrigid enforcement of the existing\nregulations by the bureau of immi\ngration.\nIt is suggested that the immi\ngration iaw should be amended. *\nGREELY STANDS BY COOK.\nResigned From Club Through Loy\nalty to His Friend.\nGen. A. W. Greely tendered his\nresignation as a member of the Ex\nplorers\' ciub of New York almost\nat the beginning of the Peary-Cook\ncontroversy and it has been accept\ned. This became known Saturday\nthrough the club\'s secretary, Harry\nC. Walsh.\n"I am not in a position to say\nwhether General Greely\'s resignation\nwas due to the Cook-Peary contro\nversy," said Mr. Walsh. ; "In view\nof his friendship for Dr. Cook, how\never, and the confidence he express\ned in him, his resignation may be\nso construed by many persons.\n"I can say that he did not men\ntion Dr. Cook in his letter to the\nclub. It was just a curt note of\nresignation and did not give any\nreason for the step."\nIt was learned that the members\nof the Explorers\' club had made a\nstrong effort tr persuade General\nGreely to reconsider his intention to\nresign, -but without avail.\nGeneral Greely was president of\nthe club prior to the election of\nCommander Peary to that office.\nIn all the Cook-Peary controversy,\nGeneral Greely, himself an arctic ex\nplorer of experience and reputation,\nhas stood staunchly by Dr. Cook. *\nLOYAL LEGION PROTESTS\nAgainst General Lee\'s Statute Be\ning in Hall of Fame.\nAs a part of the fight being made\nagainst the acceptance by the gov\nernment of the statute of Robert E.\nLee. as a permanent addition to the\nHall of Fame in the Capital build\niug. the Vice President Saturday\nlaid before the Senate a resolution\nadopted by the .Michigan eommaudery\nof the Loyal Legion on November\n4. This resolution characterizes as\nan insult to the nation the sugges\ntion that if the statute of Lee be\nrejected by Congress Virginia will\nwithdraw the bronze statute of\nGeorge Washington, which accom\npanies it.

Mrs.\nMaggie Hunter, aged 32. found. Just\ninside the front door of the house,\nis at the Savannah hospital, dying.\nPhysicians state that Mrs. Ohland\ner was the victim of a criminal as\nsault just before she was killed.\n.One hundred and fifty negro men,\ncaught in the .meshes of the police\ndrag net through Yamacraw, the\nnegro section of the city, are priso\nners in the police station, the theory\nof the police being, that a negro\nman, having planned an assault u/on\nMrs. Ohlander, was compelled to\ncommit the other crimes in order to\nescape.\nOther arrests, will be made until\nevery negro in the city who in any\nway resembles the description of a\nnegro, who during three days had\nbeen frequently about the premises\nof the house of the murders is a\nprisoner. ,\nThe police believe that this negro,\nusing an axe taken from the wood\nshed in the rear of the Gribble home,\nbeat Mrs. Gribble to death, struck\ndown Mrs. Hunter and after assault\ning Mrs. Ohlander in the wide, long\nhall way, where the bodies were\nfound, finished his terrible work by\nbeating in her skull with the weapon.\nMrs. Gribble evidently was attack\ned Irom behind, na. she sat in an easy\nchair reading. On the fioor, beside\nher body, were found tho newspaper\nshe was reading and her spectacles.\nOne, or possibly "two, blows were\ndealt her. Her\'grey hair, blood\nmatted, shows the imprint of the\nblunt axe.\nThen the murder stealthily ap\nproaching aged Mrs. Gribble, killod\nher. It is believed that Mrs. Ohland\ner was attacked as she left her room\nto enter the hall way, was assault\ned and killed. Mrs. Hunter\'s skull\nwas crushed in and her death is a\nmatter of but a few hours.\nThe motley hord of prisoners are\nquiet and frightened in the police\nstation and jail. It i? believed that\nif the negro suspected of the crime\nis caught he can be quickly identi\nfied.\nBloodhounds have been at .work\nin an effort to take the trail from\nthe woodshed where the axe wa9\nfound by the murderer, but as\nthe house of mureders is almost\nwithin the heart of the city and as\nthe murders were probably commit\nted several hours before the discov\nery of the bodies, the dogs will bej\nof little use.\nMayor Tiedemah, of Savannah, has\noffered a Toward of $1.000 for the\ncapture with evidence to convict of\nthe slayer of Mrs. Gribble and Mrs.\nOhlander,, and the assailant of Mrs. j\nMaggie Hunter, who was not. identi\nfied for hours after the discovery |\nof the murders.\nIf is now almost certainly known\nthat a negro, the negro who was it\nfirst suspected is thex guilty man.\nPersons hove been found who state\nthat this negro was seen entering\nthe Gribble house With the fatal\naxe in his hand, and was seen clos\ning the shutters to the windows of\nthe house, and to leave the premis\nes, all at the hour when it is be\nlieved the murders were committed.\nThis negro\'s description has been\nI printed on handbills and scattered\nbroadcast over the city and county,\nwith the reward offered, and all\nnearby towns have been notified and\nare on the lookour. Police officers\nin automobiles have covered all the\nroads for miles surrounding the city,\nwhile posses on foot have scoured\nthe places where automobiles could\nnot go. The house-to-house search\nof negro homes continues. It seems\nhardly possible that the egro can\nlong remain at large.\nMerchant Sandbagged.\nAt Winston-Salem. N. C, Frank H.\nWatlington. a merchant of that city,\nwas sandbagged and robbed by tbrev\nnegroes Sunday night. After beating\nMr. Watlington into unconsciousness,\nthe nergoes dragged him about fifty\nyards from the sr:^<-t, wb<-re they\nrifled his pockets.

Continuing their investigations,\nthey discovered the bullets, which\nwere of the regulation army-design.\nFollowing back the line of fire as\nshown by the track of the bullet,\nI the marksmen could have been no\nwhere else than within the bar\nracks.\nThe congressional defenders of the\nnegro infantrymen maintained that\nthe only firing In the town was done\nby men of the Twenty-fifth who had\nbroken parole, and that former Pres\nident Roosevelt, In discharging two\ncompanies without individual mili\ntary trial, bad worked a severe in\njustice on both the companies and\nthe regiment.\nIt Is understood that the court\nwhich has practically concluded its\nexamination of the evidence it has\nsecured will permit such discharge!\nmembers of the regiment. as care\nto do so to appear before it and tes\ntify.; ,\' .\';. .. . \'.. - ?\nOFFICERS OF NORTH AND SOUTH i\nFought Against Their Sections in\nthe Late War.\nIn a speech at the New York\nSouthern Society dinner a Tew nights\nago.

This is a great error ;\nI We are slow to look beyond generali\nties to *be essential trjlith. The\n.Civil\' War was a war between the\nStates, but as to the participants\nit was purely a local question. There\nwere seventeen brigadier generals,\nfour major generals and one lieu\ntenant general in the Southern army\nwho were born in the \' Northern\nStates. Of these, seven were born.in\nthe State of New York.- Of the first\nfive, who were full generals of the\nConfederate army, Cooper, who was\nthe ranking officer, was born in New\nYork, and Albert Sidney Johnston\nwas of a Connecticut father and a\nMassachusetts mother. Klrby Smith,\n.the last general who surrendered,\nwaB of New England parentage.\nEighty of the graduates of West\nPoint who entered the Confederate\narm were born in the nor-seceding\nStates.\n"But there was reciprocity on our\npart.. Kentucky brought forth the\ncentral figure of the epoch, Abra\nham Lincoln; Virginia gave birth to\nThomas, the rock of Chlcamauga,\nand Tennessee, produced Farragut,\nthe greatest of the admirals. The\ncommanding officers of 12 of Far\nragut\'s 22 ships at the battle ??\' New\nOreans were born in Blave-holding\nStates. Early in the war the com\nmanding officers of the -Northern\narmy was a Virginian and the rank\ning officer of the Southern army\nwas a New Yorker.

The nine occupants of the\nboat, which was marked "Bessemer\nand Marquette No. 4," were frozen\nscill in death. Taking the yawl\nin tow the Perry made all steam for\nErie, arriving there late Sunday.\nAll police reserves were called out\nand ambulances lined the wharves.\nNews of the finding of the bodie.>\nhad reached the city, and thousands\nof persons swarmed to the wharves.\nAs soon as the fish boat made afast\na force of men with tackle set to\nwork raising the dead bodies to the\ndock, where wagons were in wait\ning.

In the bow end\nk)f the boat was ijound <}omptete\nclothing for one roan and it is the\nbelief that the yawl originally con\ntained ten men and that one be\ncoming crazed had discarded his\niclolhing and jumcd into the Jey\nwaters. ?\nAlbert J.

A\nCatholic society has been ordered to\ncease sending food to the prisoners\nand these are in a fair way to starve\nto death, as they are allowed only\ntwo cents a day for food. Corporal\npunishment is meted out diily to\nvarious alleged offenders.

And yot on tho tes\ntimony of such men as this we are\nasked to believe that Dr. Cook is a\nliar.\nHow is it possible for a business\nman to make his business a success\nunless he lets people know, that he\nis in business?

And now comes Attorney Gen\neral Wickersham and outlines a\nscheme for turning over, to the con\ntrol of the general govt-rnmeat all\n? corporations doing an interstate bus\niness. He proposes national incor\nporation and adds that if such a law\ndemonstrates its value it may. be\nwise ultimately to prohibit State\ncorporations from engaging in Inter\nstate commerce.\nThe Commoner says this is the\nmost gigantic- step yet \'proposed\'in\nthe direction of centralization. That\nthis new scheme Is not advanced in\nthe interest of the people but in tht\ninterest of the corporations is evi\ndent from \'-Mr. wickersham*S state\nment that the government "must\nprovide means of enabling co-opera\ntive enterprises to engage freely in\ninterstate and foreign commerce\nwithout interference by State action,\nwhich fetters, confines and destroys\nthe possibility of such free pursuit."\nTo prevent "interference by State\naction\'?this is tho whole purpose\nof national incorporation. Surely\nthe- Democrats can present a united\nfront against this menace to the\nauthority exercised by the State.\nThe Democratic plan is to add fed\neral regulation to State regulation\n.but Mr. Wickersham proposes to\nsubstitute federal regulation for\nState regulation. The Democratic\nplan of requiring a federal license,\nnot for all corporations but for large\nones, preserves State authority and\n! supplements it with federal super\n. vision, but the administration\'s plan\ncontesplates the abolition of State\nregulation entirely. Tho predatory\ncorporations seem to prefer to risk\nan Aid rich-Cannon kind of federal\nregulation to regulate by the poo\npie through thejtr State- legislatures.\nThe Christmas Oratorio.\nMore than a century and a half\nhave flown since the great Cnrist\nmas oratorio, Handel\'s "Messiah,"\nwas written, but the music, like\nthe theme, will never die. Rather,\nlike its theme again, it grows more\npopular with the passing years. It\nwas first given in Dublin for the\ncause of charity, for Handel had a\nspecially warm spot in his heart for\nthe Irish people, and he was never\nhappier than when helping the poor\nand needy. When writing the ora\ntorio, which has for its theme the\nadvent of the Messiah, it seemed\nas if Handel was inspired. So\ntransported was his soul that he\nsays "I did think I saw all heaven\nbefore me, and the great God him\nself." The sublime grandeur of the\nHallelujah Chorus touches the emo\ntions of well night every hearer. As\nis well known the audience invari\nably rises when this choroua is sung.\nThis custom dates back to the first\ntime George II of England heard It.\nHe was so affected by the wondrous\nmajesty of its music that he.leaped\nto his feet and remained standing,\nthe audience, of-course; following\nexample. Many hundreds of choirs\nin America and England repeat the\njoyful and sublime strains of the\nMessiah at every Christmastide.\nTho Glamor of Distance.\nIt is often amusing to see how\npeople will deceive themselves into\nthinking that they -get better goods\nby going away from home. People\nwill go to the big cities, join in the\ndopartment store mob to the loss\nof their Lime and temper, carry\nheavy bundles about the streets and\ninto the trains, and return with ar\nticles that could be had just as well\nat home. Examined by the sober\nlight of second thought, they often\nprove unsatisfactory, but bought at\na distance they can\'t be returned,\nsave perhaps by a prohibitive amount\nof time and trouble. People do not\nalways stop to think that the mer\nchants in their home towns have\nmade marvellous advauces within a\nfew years. They are as keenly alive\nto the need of keeping up with the\nfashions us anyone. They have reg\nular clearance sales to get rid of\nold goods, and it is no more pos\nsible for them to carry back num\nber stylos than it is for the big city\ncompetitor. Therefore, why not pat\nronize the home merchant, who will\nsee to it that you get satisfaction if\nthe goods are not what is represent\ned?\nAnother Revolution.\nWhen Louis XVI of France heard\nof the cupturo of the Bastille he\nexclaimed, "It is an insurrection, \'\nto which one of the attendant nobles\nreplied, "Sir. it is a revolution."\nThat revolution was brought about\nby the nobles through their abuse of\npower extending over a long period.\nNow, if all signs do not fail, the\nEnglish nobles by their insane re\njection of tho budget have precipi\ntated a revolution which will be\nuono the leas effective for being\nwrought with ballots instead of bul\nlets. By the end of .January it will\nbe known whether by the triumph\nof the lords the bands of the politi\ncal clock aro to be set back L\'uO\nyears or whether by the triumph of\nthe commons they will hi- measura\nbly set forward. The prospect is\nthat they will bo set forward and\ntho special prvilleges of the house\nof lords bo considerably shorn and\nperhaps extinguished.\nIt has been published over big\nhead lines in the newspapers that\nDr. Frederick A. Cook\'s personal\nlawyer, Henry Wellington Wack, has\nSevered relations With his client.\n.Mr. Wack intimated that ho quit\nDr. Cook, but the fact seems to be\nthat Dr. Cook quit Mr. Wack. For\nsome weeks Dr. Cook has refused\nto buswer Mr. Wack\'s [letters to\nWack Was Fired.\nhim, which, taken in connection\nwith the othor fact that Mrs. Cook\nover a week ago wrote Mr, Week\nto discontinue air-expense on the\nDocjtor\'s account, would indicate\nthat Dr. Cook wanted to get rid of\nMr. Wack, but it seems to have\ntaken that individual ten days or\nmore to realize it.\nCLASSIFIED COLUMNi\nOne-half Cent a Word\nFound Notices Free.\n?For Sale?A young mare; gentle |\ndriver.

JStSQ OF NEW CAMPAIGN.\nRevs and Courier Urges Adoption of\nPublic Rood-Building Plan and\nCaation of Highway Commission.\nThe following editorial from The\nNewa and Courier will be read with\ninterest^\nMore than half the States of the\nUnion have adopted the policy of giv\ning aid in the construction of public\nroads, ail of the States have the mar\nter under consderation, and in many\nK Xsounties large bond issues have been\nmade to promote the- building of\ngood roads. The subject is now at\ntracting N a" great\' deal of attention\nin South Carolina, and, quoting\nfrom Watson\'s Hand-book of South\nCarolina, as "nothing aids more in\nthe development of the agricultural\nindustry of a commonwealth than\ngood roads," thore is fair promise\nthat the legislature of this State\n?rill adopie a broad plan for the\nreconstruction or new construction\nof a great system of highways to the\nIndustrial advantage of every good\n-enterprise in the State. That is\nwhat ought to be done, and after\nour riotous living with the whiskey\nquestion for fifteen years we should\nthink that some useful occupation\nfor our energies would be veryt-wel\n"fcome to everybody in the State.\nAccording to the latest informa\ntion we have, there are 41,830 miles\nof public roads in South Carolina,\nof which only 1,878 miles are im\nproved; a little more than one mile\nof public road to the square mile\nof territory, one mile of road to\nevery 32 inhabitants, one mile of\nimproved road to every 713 inhabi\ntants. "Here\'s a state of things"\nthat ought to receive the intelligent\n-consideration of the people of the\nState, and particularly of those who\nare engaged in agricultural work.\nLast year the cost of hauling the\ncotton from the farms to market\nwas about $8,000,000. If the pub\nlic roads throughout the cotton belt\nwere good the cost would have been\nless than the half of that sum. It\nhas been estimated that the cost of\nhauling over the roads we have\namounts to 27 cents per ton the\nmile, and that the cost of hauling\nover good roads would not exceed\n10 cents per ton the mile. Almost\nany one can make the calculation of\nwhat the saving would be if the\npublic roads of the State were put\nin marketing condition.\n: It is estimated that very service\n? able public roads equal to almost any\ntraffic they would be required to\nstand, can be constructed in this\nState at a cost of from $150 to $300\nthe . mile, and that such roads can\nbe maintained at an hnniiol cost of\n$10 \'the mile. Both thesenjbstlmates\nare rather low, we should say, be\ncause of the long hauls in some\nparts of the State on road-building\nmaterial and the almost utter lack\nof drainage in much difficult terri\ntory, but in a very large part of the\nState doubtless excellent roads of\nthe sand-clay sort could be built at\na cost of about $500 the mile. In\nthe saving of labor to the farmers\nand other producers they would be\nworth in the first year after con\nstruction and year after year more\nthan the initial cost, and if properly\nconstructed, could be maintained at\nlittle if any additional yearly ex\npense to the taxpayers. If such roads\nare to be built they must be built\nby public taxation, and the taxes\nmust be high enough to warrant the\nbest work.\nWhat is needed is the adoption by\nthe legislature of a public road\nbuilding plan and the creation of\na State highway commission to car\nry out this plan, not in a year or\nin two years not with a dab here\nand there, not by filling up a "bad\nhole" in the Pour-Hole Swamp\ncountry, but on a well thought out\nscientific scheme which will give to\nthe State a comprehensive system\nof public highways capable of ac\ncommodating t^e business jof the\nState from the mountains to the\nsea. The first of the pathfinders\nin South Carolina did some very\ngood engineering work as to routes\nand distances, but they did not know\nhow to build good roads as the Ro\nmans did and as the experts of the\npresent day are doing. It is not\na thing of which we can be very\nproud that in the county of Charles\nton, after more than two hundred\nyears cf the highest civilization in\nthe world, there are only about\n7-00 miles of public roads, including\nthirty miles that have been surfac\ned with shells and about ten miles\nwith cement gravel. In addition, of\ncourse, we have about sixty mile3\nor so of Belgin blocks and about a\nmile of asphalt roadway in the city\nof Charleston. In the county of\nMecklenburg, North Carolina, be it\nsaid to our shame and to the glory\nof the "Descendants" in that county,\nthere are almost as many miles of\nmacadam roadway as there are total\nmiles of any sort of public roads\nin the imperial county of Charles\nton!\nThis is the time to strike for bet\nter roads. The people in all parts\nof the State are "taking notice."\nThere was never a better time than\nfor some member of the legislature\nof statesmanlike material to make\nhimself famous by leading in the\ngood roads movement, not with the\nhope of getting office?that might\ncome, and would come, later as sure\nly as the sun?but with the purpose\nof doing a great big thing for the\nbenefit of all the people of the State.\nWe have not taken much stock in\n<he grand touring of the automo\nyie owners and makers, because\nof the very distinct flavor of adver\ntising about much of their work,\n4>ut their speed tests and their en\ndurance runs and their long dis\ntance efforts have undoubtedly had\nthe effect of stirring the peoplo of\nthe country to a practical appre\nciation of the practical benefits of\ngood roads.\nThree years ago it would have\ntaken from ten to twelve hours to\nmake the journey from Charl^stw?\nto Summerville in an auto-car, und\nprobably a week to haul the machine\nback to the city by a team of en\ndurance mules; now the journey,\nwith the road only about half com\npleted as It ought to be, can be\nmade in an hour and a half with\nthe greatest ease and In perfect safe\nty and comfort. Two days ago a\nrun was made - from ? Charleston to\nOrangeburg by a string of automo\nbiles, a distance of about 79 miles,\nIn a Httle,morA (toan.6l^.houi^,and\nthe ~ run back ^^ha^e^on;^b^\'a"\nsomew-hat different\' ^onteV jw^\'majde\nin about five hours. .\' If/ the\' roads\nwere rebuilt in places and well sur\nfaced with gravel and well drained,\nso that It would always be above\nhigh water, it would be practicable\nto make the run from Charleston to\nOrangeburg in three hours wlthour\nspeeding. If the public road between\nOrangeburg and Columbia should be\nrebuilt and well drained, and well\ngraded, as it will be\' soon. or late,\nit would be an easy journey to make\nthe run from Charleston to the State\ncapital in three and a half or four\nhours without running any risk and\nin the greatest comfort. The peo\nple of all the towns and counties\nbetween Charleston and Columbia\nare deeply interested in the. con\nstruction of good roads between the\npolitical heart of the 8tate at Co\nlumbia, and "our matchless seaport\nat Charleston," as Commissioner\nWatson called it the other night in\nhis admirable address.\nThe spirit of the people was ex\nhibited in a most gratifying way at\nOrangeburg Wednesday night upon\nthe arrival of tho "pathfinders" from\nCharleston, as they have been call\ned, and Berkeley and Dorchester\nand Lexington and Calhoun and Co\nlumbta. There were at least five\nhundred of the most substantial and\npublic-spirited men in the State at\nthe meeting, and one-third of the\nnumber were visiting delegates, bent\nupon making a fair start in the work\nof building up the highways of the\nState. A more intelligent, alert and\nprogressive body of citizens has nev\ner assembled in this State, and the\nsplendid people of Orangeburg were\nmore than equal to rthe tax upon\ntheir hospitality. After a free dis\ncussion that lasted beyond mianight,\na plan was agreed upon unanimously\nfor the opening of a\' through high\nway of the best construction between\n?Charleston and Columbia. The\nlegend \' on the badge with which\neverybody at the meeting was tag\ngel read ."All Roads Lead to Or\nangeburg," and with the amendment,\n"Ali Roads Lead Through Orange\nburg to Charleston," the motto was\nadopted nem con. We have never\nseen such a meeting as that at Or\nangeburg in Charleston to discuss\nany subject of material importance\nto this community, and we do not\nbelieve that any such meeting was\never held at any other place in this\nState.\nBut the meeting will have been\nheld in vain if those who took part\nin its deliberations do not go to\nwork now in dead earnest to carry\nout the plans which were so happily\nagreed upon. The road will not\nI build itself. It can\'t be built with\nj out taxation, and with a good deal\nj of taxation. It ought to be built\nby taxation of the whole body of\ntaxpayers, because It will benefit\n/every man. woman and child in the\nterritory through which the road\nwill run. It will make it easier for\nthe farmer to get his produce to\nmarket. It will make communica\ntion between the people in the coun\ntry and in the towns easy and com\nfortable. It will lead to the devel\nopment of tens of thousands of acres\nof waste lands. It will increase the\ndesirable population of the State.\nIt will enhance the educational fa*\ncilities of the State. It will result\nin the drainage of vast stretches of\nterritory that have been abandoned\nbecause they are uninhabitable on\naccount of disease-breeding insects\nand stagnant water. It will add to\nthe productive area of the State sev\neral hundred thousand acres of the\nbest land in the State, and would\npay for itself ten times over in the\nimprovement of our business con\nditions and the actual values it would\nadd to the taxable property of tho\nState.\nThere ought to be some man in\nSouth Carolina big enough and in\nearnest enough to lead in the move\nment for good roads, and when he\nappears he will acknowledge, as all\nmust who were present at the meet\ning in Orangeburg that the be\nginning of this new campaign was\nreally instituted there. Having\nabandoned the bottle, let us take up\nthe building of good roads for the\nimprovement of the State. *\nConference Appoiutmcnts.\nUp until the hour of going to press\nThe Times and Democrat was unable\nto get any more of the appointments\nin this district than these named be\nlow:\nPresiding elder?C.
