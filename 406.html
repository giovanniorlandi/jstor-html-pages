T. Briscoe, the\n•set of the Institution. The lawn\nsloping from the front of the honte\nwas well lighted with Japanese lan*\nterns and the front portico from\nwhich the exercise* were rendered\nwae splendidly lighted with hang*\ninf lamps, well onriained and dee*\norated\' with the colors of the school\ndience occupied seats on the lawn.\nGay Hill seems apecially favor\nable and well chosen a location to\nfill the requirements of the new\nproject, the success of which, meat*\nored bj its first dosing exercises,\nwould seem assured and well mer\nited. The masterful manner in\nwhich each part was rendered prov\ned the eminent fitness of the in\nstructors and exhibited a marked\ndegree of talent among the young\nladies and boys of the school.\nThe exercises were opened with an\naddress by Prof. Briscos welcoming\nthe sndience and giving a brief his\ntory of the origin and success for\nthe past year of the Institution and\nappealing to the public to jndge the\ntree by its frnit and patronise the\nschool. He said in part: “About\ntwelve months ago a lady very dear\nto me conceived the idea of conduct\ning a school for the higher educa\ntion of young ladies and the ele\nmentary training of small girls and\nboys. She suggested this beautiful\nlocality of Charlotte Hall and the\nexcellent situation of onr home on\nits suburbs as offering extraordinary\nadvantages for such an institntion.\nThe success with which we have\n/net the past ten months has been a\ngreat encouragement to ns. We\nhave accomplished much and we\nare now about to close for the first\nvacation a very interesting school.**\nThe warn intnapnnd\nwith music, recitations, drills and\nplays.\nAll present joined in high praise\nof the entertainment and many\ncompliments for Professor and Mrs.\nBriscoe on their excellent achieve\nment, and hoping that they may\nwitness graduating exercises of the\ninstitntion in the near fntnre.\n[Communicated.\nScotland, Md., Jane 25, *OO.\nHears. Editors:—As 1 do not\ndesire to overcharge the readers of\nthe Beacon with a useless load of\nwords will briefly say that the at\ntendance at the Commencement of\nSt. Mary\'s Seminary was large and\nevery one present were pleased with\nprogreu of pupils. The more ad\nvanced ones no doobt appreciate\nthe bleuings they enjoy. Their\nage and experience cause them to\nduly reflect on their privileges, and\nin doing so, they feel their position\nto be one of great advantage. Their\nstatus in society will be enhanced\nand howeyer high may be their\ncomparative rank, however they\nmay shine by the force of contraat,\nthe proper training received at their\nAlma Mater will act aa a Polar Star\nto direct and guide them aright as\nthey advance in the world.\nThe Principal, Mia Langley,\nmerit* much praise and the profi\nciency of her pnplla prove that med\nitation is the principal basis of\nknowledge—that it searches and\nfinds deep and difficult truths,\nwhich before lay concealed in dark\nnea. It tangbt Franklin to “snatch\nlightning from Heaven and the\nscepter from tyrants.**\nThe three graduates. Misses Ella\nHodgson, Cumberland, Md.; Emily\nBishop, Smithsbnrg, Md. and Bath\nJonrdan, Darlington, Md., were\npre-eminently distinguishable and\nthe essay of Mia Hodgson (Honor\nGraduate) was a mirror, to speak\nso, reflecting beautiful thoughts,\nexpressions, which proved that she\nis an accurate observer of human\nlife and that the human under\nstanding, in all its conscious pro\nsentations and reflexes, is itself only\na phenomenon of the mind\'s ana,\nand requires the same corrections\nas the appearances transmitted by\nthe outward senses. Like a thread\nof gold the principle—“A mind\nimbaed with integrity is the most\naugust posaeaion,** ran through\nthe essay. T. W\nW. A.

Lip San\nday was a fine day and neap half\na million of people passed Jweugfa\nthe gates anS crowded the ground 4.\n1 say crowded for it was an \'rigM al\namsk f Mi djMHI H i\nabout. It is intereating to be la a\ncrowd like this; to hear the obeeft\nvationa of the eight seers and es\npecially to note how many of them\nspeak English. It is said there is a\npermanent population of 15,000\nAmericana in Paris and a floating\npopulation of 40,000. There are\ndoubtless more than twice is many\nEnglish here. 1 have bees trying\nto find a hotel where no Eiglish is\nspoken, because 1 am anxious to\nimprove my French, bnt hare found\nonly one—that in Latin Quarter on\nRue Bonaparte and too far from the\nExposition. At the hotel where 1\nam stopping all three of the clerks,\nthe porters and the waiter* at the\ntable speak English and mere Eng\nlish is heard in the diniig room\nthan any other language. In all\nthe better shops English can be\nheard and very many have the sign\n“English spoken” on the window.\nThese foots are significant. They\nwere not nearly so striking at the\ntwo previous Expositions in 1878\nand 1889. They indicate the cer\ntain and accelerated progress of onr\nmother tongue and the ultimate\nsubjection of all other languages to\nit. Educated Germans speak Eng\nlish frequently without an accent\nhaving learned it with grammatical\naccuracy from English professors\nin the German schools. We know\nfrom observation that eonre- of our\nGerman idtiftps in the United\nStates do not speak English\' cor\nrectly after a residence of twenty\nyears or more. It is the difference\nbetween studying a language and\n“picking it npmixing it with\nforeign idioms, using it before it is\nlearned, and thus forming and con\nfirming almost ineradicable errors\nof speech.\n1 met an untamed, immutable\nAmerican Girl from New Jersey,\nemployed by the Hygenio Optical\nCompany, of New York. As I\npassed this Exhibit she extended a\npaper and said in English : “Will\nyon look at onr circular.”\n“Why do yon speak to me in\nEnglish V*\n“Because 1 thought yon knew\nthe language.”\n“But you know French do you\nnot?”\n“No, 1 don’t know it and I don’t\nwant to know it. I hate the lan\nguage, and 1 hate the French. Ob,\nI hate them ? They have -no po\nliteness beyond a too frequent tak\ning off their bat, and saying “par\ndong madame, meroi madame.”\n“1 suspect yon are a little home\nsick.”\n“Yes, 1 am, I’ve been here since\nJanuary and all I want is to get\nhome and forget the sight and sound\nof every thing that has French in\nit.”\nThe Hygenio Optical Co., haa a\nspectacled horse with prismatic\nlenses that make the ground appear\nabont fifteen inches nearer hit nose\nthan it actually is. He therefore\nlifts hie feet high to reach it and it\nthought to be a high stepper with\nknee action—a quality very much\ndesired by the swagger set. This\nOptical Go., makes a specialty of a\nglass so slightly tinted that the tint\ncannot be observed unless the glebe\nis laid on n white anrfaoe, bat it is\nsaid to be restful and helpfnl to the\neye. Specialists say that the anx\nious wrinkled characteristic of the\nAmerican face is due in part to the\ngreater glare of the American ran\nwhich haa in recent years been in\ntensified by reflection from smooth\nasphalt streets. We have certainly\na largei average of daaxling days\nin America than in Europe.\nThe United States Publishers\nBuilding at the Paris Exposition\nnnder the management of Mr. Cape\nhart waa inaugurated today with\n**• The American Ambas\n-lue t mum mi*\n■|jP of the Hew York Times issued\nlatest number.

The back parlor, in\nwhich the ceremony was performed,\nwaa embowered in palms, behind\nwhose foliage an orchestra was sta\ntioned. The folding doors were\ndraped with a curtain of margue\nrites, and an aisle waa formed\nthrough the front parlor by tell\nbaskets filled with marguerites\nlinked together by chains of field\ndaisies and vines. The bridal par\nty descended the wide staircase to\nthe strains of the wedding march\nfrom “Lohengrin,” the ushers lead\ning. The bride was escorted by\nher father, Mr. John A.

A\ncoronet of lilies of the valley waa\nworn in her beautiful hair, and\ncanght in the laces of her corsage\nwas the groom’s gift, a marguerite\nof diamonds and pearls.

The name\nwas particularly fitting for more\nreasons than one. Lissie was the\nyoungest child of six. She was the\ndxth orphan who had been admit-1\nted to the institution. Her father\nwas a locomotive engineer on the\nVermont Central railway. Lissie,\nthe youngest child, was six years\nold when he was killed in a colli\nsion, and brought home a corpse to\nhis little one. Hit eldest daughter\nhad been keeping house since the\ndeath of her mother, and soon after\nthe father’s demise she married a\nsection boss. The children were\nscattered among friends and rela\ntives. The boys had found good\nhomes end were all at work earning\nmoney. Lissie was taken into the\norphanage, of which her aunt, a\nkindly, middle-aged woman, was\nmatron.\nNobody objected to this arrange\nment, for Mias Sanders stood very\nhigh in the esteem of the towns\npeople, who thought it but right\nthat the youngest child shonld be\ncared for at the expense of the\ncounty, since sll the others hsd not\nbecome burdens on their charity.\nNumber six grew up a likely girl\namidst the orphans of the piece,\nand now, at the age of 16, she wsc\nquite s help to her annt, who still\ncontinued in charge of the oonnty’s\nwaifs. All who had been there\n-whew she was a toddier were gone.\nThe girls had sought service with\nthe townspeople, the boys were at\nwork in the fields. Lissie was tak\ning upon her yonng shoulders the\ncares which burdened the white\nhaired woman who had been a\nmother to her.\nAt this time there was not an\nempty bed or cradle in the institu\ntion. An open winter, something\nunusual in the rigorous climate of\nthe Vermont hills, bad depopulated\nthe firesides and filled the grave\nyards. For years there hsd not\nbeen infants in the home until this\nwinter. Now there were two, ahoy\nand a girl. The former- was the\nson of a schoolmaster. The girl\nwas a poor washerwoman\'s child.\nBad, the male infant, was robust\nenough and thriving as success fully\namong the strangers as he bad in\nbis mother’s arms, bat Bee, the\nchar-woman’s infant daughter,\nneeded a deal of attention. This\nlittle mite of humanity had been\nchristened Beatrice, to the great\nastonishment of everybody. A\nwasherwoman calling her child Be\natrice was an nnheard of thing\namong the plain people of the Ver\nmont hills. Maggie, Mary or An\nnie, wagged the gossips, would have\nbeen more suitable.\nMrs. Rossi ter, the mother of lit\ntle Beatrice, came to the Green\nmountain town when her child was\nnot quite a year old. Sh? wore\nwidow’s weeds and informed those\nwho asked her antecedent* that her\nhusband had died a short time ego,\nleaving her in poverty. He bed\nbeen a good mao, she explained,\nbat a year’s sickness had eaten up\ntheir little savings.\nThis was In the summer of the\nyear, and a few day* before Christ\nmas the mother was called away\nfrom little Bee. before she ooold\nindicate what she wanted done with\nher child. After the bnrial of Mrs.\nRoaeiter the baby was taken to the\norphanage and placed in charge of\nMies Sanders. From the first Lis\nsie Mac ready—Number 6—took a\nviolet fancy to the little one. Bee\ngot all the coddling and fondling.\nShe waa snob a wee thing: to deli\ncate rad frail. Big blue eyes gesed\nwistfully out of a thin, pale face,\nand there was a sad droop to the\nbaby’s month, as if the child rea\nlised it* forlorn condition.\n1 # 3\n1 M A mJP n. *\n■ ..*\\ : .*" * :*■ -*\'\n*\' X-L -■ ■ jm~ -\' .f! ..X.\njob fiorem, . .?^b\'o\nnqri.t. hia no\nmvmtwmmm ■ii wmwm a Tiiiiimu\n#\n* Parties haring heal or Persona.

It hftd # been issued hj a\nminister in a small town of New\noome the wife of a man named Cor\nral.\nThis wss news, indsed, to the\ndenisens of Water Hollow, and they\nat onoe speculated what had be\ncome of her first hnsbsnd. By the\ntime they had found something else\nto talk about Baby Bse was forgot\nten, ao far as they were concerned.\nSlowly the little girl grew, ten\nderly cared for by Number 6, who\nhad become deeply attached to her,\nand oonld not endure to hare her\nout of her sight. Several oppor\ntunities presented themselves for\nBoo’s adoption, bnt Lizzie Macready\nobjected. She conld not bear to\nthink of a separation from the lit\ntlo waif whose life, like beiy, seem\ned cast in lonely paths. Bnt thero\ncame a time When even Lizzie conld\nno longer expect to retain control\nof Bee Boesiter. A child lias couple\nhad come to summer at a neighbor\ning resort in the Green mountains,\nand while on their journey\nthe orphanage. They bad long ago\ndecided to adopt a child, and a\nglance at little Bee eatisfied them\nthat she was just what they wonted.\nThe bargain waa made and it was\nagreed that Bee should be sent to\nthem a few days before their earn* •\ntner sojourn came to an end.\nFrom that time on Number Six\neaa a changed being. She pined\nand.fretted, as the day drew near\nthat wcmlAsstparwSs her from the\nlittle girl, and Annt Sanders was\nmore than once compelled to call\na the honae physician to adminis\nter to her niece.\nThe girl who bad tasted all the\nbitterness of an orphaned life, clung\nto the motherless child with all the\nvehemenoy of a first love. Night\nand day she prayed that something\nmight interfere to let her keep the\nlittle girl a little longer.\nAnd the unexpected happened.\nA stranger alighted one day from\nthe one-horse fly which plied be\ntween the railway station and the\nbeat hotel in the town. He was a\nhandsome, prosperous looking man.\nHis clothes and the alligator bag\nindicate that. He asked for beet\nroom in the home and paid for it\nin advance. The morning after\nhie arrival he eet out for the parson\nage, and through the volubility of\nthe minister’s housekeeper, it soon\nleaked oat that he had come to in\nquire .about Mrs. Rostiter. The\nparson took him first to the little\ngraveyard and showed him the\nmonnd beneath which the old char\nwomen lay harried. Then he ac\ncompanied him to the orphanage to\n•ee little Bee.\nLizzie Macready waa bney at a\nwindow when the stranger and the\nparson walked np the gravel path.\nThe bronzed face of the former\nwae aglow with excitement. Lizzie\nbad never seen a more pleasing face,\n■be thought. It was a good, hon\nest face, too, and when a moment\nlater she wae requested to bring\nlittle Bee to’ the reception-room\nher heart throbbed wildly. Per\nhaps her prayer bad been heard.\nThe woman and the child enter\ned the room, and the stranger came\nforward to greet them. He caught\nthe little girl in hie arms and kiss\ned her. Bee who had never before\nbeen carreeeed by a man, wound\nher arms around his neck and laid\nher bead on his sbonlder. A good\nomen, thought Lizzie, and confi\ndently shook the stranger\'s band.\nThe minister introduced the strang\ner aa Mr. Correll, little Bee\'s half\nbrother. Hie father, a wild reek\nlees fellow bad left hie wife. He\nhad taken they: child, a boy, with\nhim. The boy wae the man who\nnow stood before them.

A few month* ago be\ndied leering everything to hi* eon\nand imploring him to find hie moth*\ner. Tbia the eon did. He bad\nlearned of bU mother’s divorce and\nmarriage to Bossiter, and of the\nbirth of a baby girt. Their trail\nled to the little mountain town in\nVermont and here be found one in\nher grave, the other a public charge\nIn an orphanage. Now be would\ntake her away with him and spend\nhis riches upon her. In a day or\ntwo be would be ready to depart.\nLissie Macready grew pale aa\ndeath when he announced his in\ntention. The child still nestling\nin his arms, held out her hand to\nher foster-mother.\n\'Dear Number Six,* she cried. ‘I\ncan never leave you I*\nSweet blushes crept into the girl\'s\ncheek at this avowal of affection on\nthe part of the ohild. The strang\ner stooped and kissed her band.\n\'How can 1 ever thank you for what\nyou have done for her I*\nFor days, Mr. Oorrell, the rich\nyoung miner, lingered in the little\nmountain town. Again the gossips\ngot together, wondering what kept\nhim in a place so devoid of attrac\ntion to people with money. There\nwas nothing-in the way of little\nBee\'s departure. Surely that fool\nish young woman, Lissie Macready,\nwould not again interpose silly ob\n. jeotions.\nEveryday the stranger went to\nthe orphanage to spend honrs with\nhis little sister and her beloved\nNumber Six, for be insisted that\nLissie Macready should accompany\nher charge on all their strolls thru\nthe garden.\nAt last he informed the landlord\nof the little hoatalry that he would\ndepart the next day. He ordered\na four-seated carriage instead of a\nsingle fly to take him to the sta\ntion.\n*1 am not going alone this time,*\nhe said with a happy smile.\n\'Going to take the little girl with\nyon, 1 see,’ answered the landlord,\nsaying to himself that there would\nbe one less for the county to feed.\n\'Yes, and a wife!\' continued\nOorrell.\n\'A wife F* gasped the inn-keeper.\n\'Where did yon get her ?\'\n\'Over at the orphanage. 1 am\ngoing to be married in the morning\nto Lissie Macready—Number Six\n—yon know I*\nBIG ENGINE* 18 SPEEDY.\nBPHCIAL TBAIV OP COLORADO EX\nCURSIONISTS TESTS HXW\nLOCOMOTIVE.\nBailway men of all classes are\nwatching with much interest the\ntests of the “1200 series" of en\ngines of the Book Island road, the\nlargest running out of Chicago in\npassenger service. Engine No. 1201\nwas given its first severe test for\npower and speed last week. The\npatrons of the Book Island\'s first\nexcursion to Colorado occupied 14\nof the largest and heaviest coaches.\nThis was enough for two trains to\nbe pulled by ordinary passenger en\ngines of the day, considering the\nspeed required. The big engine\ndid all that was expected of it and\nmore. Between Chicago and Rook\nIsland it pulled that train of four\nteen coaches with ease on schedule\ntime, and when called on for a lit\ntle extra effort developed a spead of\nover 72 miles an hour.\nEngines of that class will haul\nall the special trains which will be\nneed by the Rock Island in its se\nries of Colorado excursions, at the\nrate of one fare plus 22.00 for the\nround trip. Three more excursions\nwill be given, leaving here July 9,\nJuly 17 and August 1. The de\nparting time of the special trains\nwill be 4:45 p. m., but on the dates\nnamed excursion tickets will also\nbe honored on all regular trains.\nThe special trains to be used are\nhigh class throughout. Through\ndining oar service is provided and\nthe run from Chicago to Colorado\nis made with only one night on the\nroad. Excursion rates will be made\nto Colorado and Utah from all\npoints on the line of the Rock Is\nland between the Missouri River\nand Chicago.—Chicago InterOoean.\n“No, Edwin,*\' said Mrs. Jorgles,\n“I have never told yon a lie and\nnever will." “1 do not donbt you\nmy dear; but every time I know to\na certainty that yea have deceived\nme I will just cat a notch in the\npiano." “No yon won’t, Edward\nJorgles !
