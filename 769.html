T. Howerton. Miss. A. & M. Collesre.)\nTHRIFT AND THE CHILE\'S LOVE\nOP RESPONSIBILITY.\nSome days ago it became neces\nsary for the mother to be away from\nhome for some time. Now she is\nour financial agent does all the\nbuying and paying. A few days be\nfore she was to leave the 14 year\nold boy said to me: "While mother\nis away I will have charge of the\nmoney matters," and I noted there\nwas a tone in his voiee and a eparkle\nin his eye which showed that he\ntook great pride in the fact. This\nis but natural. Children are like\nother folks, they enjoy responsibility\nand respond to an opportunity to\ndisplay ability. This boy has earned\nsome money for the last five years,\nand has had an account in the bank\nand knows how to draw a check and\nsettle bills. So he was not averse\nto further responsibilities, but de\nsired them. Many a boy today and\ngirl too. is waiting for a "chance" to\nshow his power to do the man\'s\nwork. Here is the lesson: Every\nfamily and every mother who has a\n10 to 15 year old child has an em\nbryo business person who might be\nemployed to keep the household ac\ncounts, and even called into confer\nence as to what the household should\nspend. Have you noticed what a\nhigh ratio of the successful men of\nwhom you have read, was forced by\nthe death of a father to begin early\nin the real business of "caring for a\nfamily?" This is the cause of their\ngreatness that earlv responsibility.\nSo here is the key, give the child a\nportion of the real work of life while\nhe is vet young. At least allow him\nto keep the household accounts and J\nadittle later the farm accounts. Like\n4wise encourage him to keep his own\naccounts, and to show you just where\nhe. receives his cash and what he\nspends it for. Make every child in\nthe home a partner in the business\nof home making and especially a\npartner in the finances of the home.\nTHRIFT AND THE CHILD\'S LOVE\nOF WORK.\nwho have the disease catch it from\nothers or are mislead into it. Yes,\nlazziness is catching, ju9t as the\nmeasles, and most of it is caught\nfrom grown-ups. Children early\nhear their parents complaining of\nthe work they have to do, and in\nmany ways are taught that work is\nthe thing to shun. If they are not\nso taught you will not find one lazy\nchild in a thousand. Industry is the\nchild\'s breath of life. In play and\nwork he "lives and moves and has\nhis being." One is as normal\nas the othei he naturally goes\nfrom play to work and from\nwork to play, if you will let him,\nBut in too many homes and schools\nhe is not "let." He is hindered in\nall his childish ways at work and\nplay, his natural desires are sup\npressed, and a little later his mother\nis found at home singing "where is\nmy wandering boy tonight." He\nwill work and play and make and\nsave in many ways, and invent and\nconstruct, if you give him an old\nshow and a few tools and an acre\nand a pony, some ground and a few\nseeds. He will "work out his sal\nvation" and save his mother many\na heartache. The American Lum\nberman puts it in this verse:\nDon\'t buy him a sword and a gun,\nWhofe purpose on earth i to kill;\nDon\'t teach him that murder is fun\nOr something the bosom to thrill;\nDon\'t send him to valley or hill\nTo slaughter the dove or the daw;\nA lesson iu youth to instill.\nJust give him a Hammer and Saw.\nHe\'ll work like a beaver, the boy.\nHe\'ll learn like the wisest again\nThe tree of the woods to employ;\nHe\'ll fashion a home for the wren.\nHe\'ll make you a trinket and then\nHe\'ll figure and study and draw\nHt?\'ll learn all the lessons of men.\nIf you give hirn a Hammer and Saw.\nPlant Delinted Cotton Seed.\nrrrn -.dc3 . ta Ascrzr to\nBad Colds From Sudden Changes.\nSpring brings all kinds oi weather\nand with it come colds and the revival\nof winter coughs and hoarseness.

When\nthe soil is damp and cold, dry and\ncold or poorly prepared, a good stand\nwill frequently be secured from de\nlinted seed where land planted with\ncommon seed will have to be re\nplanted. Replanting is seldom profi\ntable, it means failure where there\nis boll weevil. One week\'s difference\nin earliness often means a difference\nof a quarter of a bale an acre.\nDelinted seed drops evenly like\ncorn or grain. There are no \'skips.\nOrdinarily seed mats up in the plant\ner and the skiDS are freauent. This\neveness of planting from delinted\nseed increases the yield 10 to 25 per\ncent. When a hard crust forms on\nthe soil after planting, the plants\nfrom delinted seed are so thick and\nevenly placed that they will usually\nlift the crust and grow. The plants\nfrom seed having short lint generally\nstart unevenly and are spaced un\nevenly so that they die before they\ncan get through a hard crust. Many\noil mills will delint seed for plant\ning for the lint. Several gins in\neastern Arkansas have put in de-\nlinting machines.\nH. M. COTTRELL,\nAgriculturist. Bureau of Farm De\nvelopment, Memphis.\nThe wise farmer this spring will\ntake every possible precaution to\ninsure getting good 6tands of all\ncrops planted, since a defective stand\nis a :ery certain means of reducing\nyields and lowering profits. In get\nting stands, good seed and thorough\npreparation making a firm, mel\nlow, clod free seed bed are of first\nimportance. With cotton, especial\ncare should be exercised not to get\nthe seed too deep. Where the ground\nis moist, half an inch of dirt on the\nseed will be plenty.

Secretary,\nthe Board of Trade, Vicksburg,\nMiss.:\n"My Dear Sir I have your favor\nof the 6th, with enclosure. It is dis\ntasteful to me at all times to have\nany of my constituents disapprove\nmy official conduct. It is my pur\npose in the performance of my duty\nto serve rather than to please. Would\nI be fair if I were to say that if the\nmembers of your board had desired\nto do justice instead of fault finding;\nthey would have waited until thev\nknew the facts in the case before\npassing the resolution of condemna\ntion. There is not a scintilla of truth\nin the statement that I had any part\nwhatever, in the defeat of the pres\nidential senate program. I would\nnot have voted for the resolution\ngiving the president power, uncon\nditionally to arm merchant ships,\nbut 1 know that 1 was in a very\nsmall minority. I was sure that if\nthe measure ever came to a vote it\nwould pans by a very large majority.\nBut I believe in a majority rule of\nCongress as I do among the people,\nand I remained at my post of duty\nin the chamber day and night dur\ning the entire session assisting in\nevery way within my power to pro\nmote the business of the Senate. I\nam not complaining of your injus\ntice, but I simply want to call at\ntention to it that may settle with\nyour own conscieitciea in the matter.\nAn : extraordinary session of Con\ngress has been called and I do not j\nexpect to vote for this resolution\ngiving the president the power to\nbring on war between the United\nStates and Geermany, if, indeed,\nGermany should be able, under the\ncircumstances, to wage war on us.\nwhich I doubt. But I am not go\ning to be a party to a measure which\nI believe may possibly bring on war,\nsacrifice human lives, break the\nhearts of women, orphan children.\nland burden posterity with an un\nbearable debt in order that a few\nI men may grow rich and richer still\nin carrying on the commerce be-\n! tween New York and London.

I will not be\na party to the position that the\nUnited States government maintain\nan attitude of neutrality toward the\nbelligerent powers of Europe, when\nits conduct makes it as much of an\nI allv as Russia or Italy. No, I will\nnot do that. Wfhen I return my\ncommission to the people of Missis\nsippi, it will not have the stain of\nthe blood of soldiers upon it forced\ninto a war tor self and pecuniary\nprofits, nor the tears of broken heart\ned mothers, wives and orphan chil\ndren. War, in my judgment, is\nI glorious, however, horrible, if waged\nin defense of principles for human\nrights but a war of conquest a\nwar for commercial plunder, is atro\ncious.\n"Now. these are my viewr if it\nbe treason, make the most of it.\n"With great respect, I have ,the\nhonor to be\n"Cordially and sincerely,\nK.

There ought to\nbe a rivers and harbors bill passed\nbefore the present fiscal year has\nclosed. But if we are to judge the\nfuture by the past, nothing is more\ncertain than that, whenever another\nriyer and harbor bill shall be pre\nsented it will meet with violent op\nposition.\n\'Before the extra session convenes\non April 2nd, it is urged that all\nfriends of waterways call upon their\nsenators and representatives to sup\nport appropriations for the rivers and\nnanors wnicn are essential to our\nnational prosperity and may be vital\nto our national prosperity.\nTeacher\'s Examinations.\nThe first examination for white\nteachers will be held in the Court\nHouse April 6th and 7th.
