But, as I came out of a\nside door and looked over to the main\nentrance to the room, I saw a typical\nspread footed colored janitor, leaning\nup against the door, his ear firmly\nfastened to the portal crack, absolute-\nly Carried away by the seductive notes\nfrom within. As he stood there he\nwas the best picture for an ad I had\never seen.

"But\nwhat style of architectiure Is ito to\nbe-" the friend persisted. "Oh, he"\nknows, it Is to be a \'period house,\' all\nnew style." "But what period?"\n"Well," he answered in a guarded\nvoice as if it were a secret, "He says\nit is to be Italian reminiscent."

The aggregate value of the cut\nis Jl.299,000,000. These are the high\nest annual valuations ever recorded,\nbut do not Indicate present conditions.\nThey merely reflect the extremely\nhigh peak in the post-war lumber\nprices which wax passed in the first\nquarter of 1920.\nThese are the principal statistics\nobtained by the Forest Service, United\nStates Department of Agriculture, in\nits 1920 canvass of American saw\nmills. They are based upon reports\nfrom 15,978 active mills out of 23,243\nestimated to have been in operation.\nSeveral thandand mills cutting less\nthan 60,000 feet were not tabulated,\nthough allowance was made for their\ncut. Comparisons with 1919 are pub\nlished by permission of the Bureau of\nthe Census, United States Department\nof Commerce.\nThe tables show that the states\nwhich Increased their cut are all in\nthe Pacific Coast group and the\nRocky Mountains.

E. Sheppard, President of the\nOrder of Railway Conductors, said\nthat the unions had decided to call off\nthe strike because of "the growing\npublic opinion that the strike would\n, be against the Labor Beard, and, con\nsequently, the government, and not\nagainst the railroads.\ni "It. was evident also that the entire\nWashington administration was\n; against us and that we have had little\n! chance of gaining onr objectives,"\nsaid Mr. Sheppard.\nj "We called this strike to gain cer\nj tain rights to which our men were en\ntitled."\nj "It soon became evident, however,\nj that the roads were succeeding In their\ni misleading propaganda to the effect\nthat we really would be striking\n: against the government,\nj "This railroad propaganda found Its\n; way to the T\'nited States Railroad La\n: bor Board.
