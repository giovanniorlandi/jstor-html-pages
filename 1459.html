ARIZ,, BY OKOKGK N. JJUUTON,, Jn I .os Ainielcs Time?., It is very far from a semt-millcjiium since, llirce little ovaw boats under the flntc of Spain, first touched the waters of the western hemi, sphere and revealed the new world to the, eyes of Europeans. It is only a little over a, century since the United States of America, spranir, so to speak, like Pallas Athene from, the brain of Jove, a completely armed ad, dition to the family of nations. It is but, little --ver half a century since California be, came a part of these United States of America,, antl less than a generation since the settle, ment of (he Great South vest hegnn., In all the 12.) years since the Republic was, founded, also in the half century since Cali, fornia became one of the States of the Union., and during every year of the last thirty, a re, alization of the vast, riches of the American, continent, of the territory of the United, Slates and of this Great Southwest h is been, more and more astonishing to the minds of, men. One would suppose that by today we, knew pretty thoroughly what the undevelop, ed resources of the Great Southwest might, reasonably be expected to become. Wc have, not reached the depths of this great ocean- of, wealth with our plummet line yet, In a residence of forty years on the Coast, the writer thought he knew a little about, what there is on the Coast, and as most of, these years have been spent in and around, I-os Angeles, ho naturally had a little con, ceit that he was pretty well acquainted Avith, the Grent Southwest. L.ast week a trip to the, Colorado River bottoms, below Yuma. made, him feel as a tenderfoot who had come.in on, the Jast train. Jew U him, this wonderful, region and its possibilities are pretty Well, known to a great many readers of The Times, b3 the stories published, if not by the demon, stration of their own eyes., Yuma lies on the map just twelve miles, from where the government isnutting In the, great .Laguna dam, at the\' confluence of the, Gila and Colorado Rivers. It is twelve miles, from Yuma down the river to the Mexican, boundry line on the Arizona side of the river, At one point. Just below Yuma, the interna, tional boundry line runs up along the river, which there takes a westerly trend and from, Yuma to Mexico is only a few miles., ONCE "A MIGHTY STREAM., Ages ago when the mountain ranges of, Arizona and California towered toward the, stars, at least twice as high as they do now,, rains were very frcduent-and came down in, torrential voIumcsallaIongthe.se mountain, ridges. The Colorado River in these past ages, was a mighty stream, sweeping dawn debris, in tons every second of Its How. The Colora, do sink was at that lime a great inland sea,, which spread over the country on both sides, of where tlic river now runs. As the erosion, of winds and. tonus, landslides and glaciers, wore down the mountain ridges year by year,, the great river carried down it vast amount, of silt, erosion from the rocks full of phos, phates, Times and disintegrated granites, as, well as the vegetation along Us banks; and, this was all deposited in what are now the, sinks of. the Colorado., .s the mountain tops were worn down, the, rains became less frequent and less in volume, but the erosion of rocks and river banks, the, Uces and vegetable mould torn from the, banks still came down ami settled into the, bottom of the great inland lake. This geogical, process went on\'from age to age to our time,, leaving the Colorado at Yuma a stream about,, half a mile wide and being at the present, lime about twenty feet deep la the deepest, portion., it is not necessary to remind Californians, that the Spanish missionaries and explorers, called this river the Colorado because of the, reddish color of its waters. It is the Colorado, up in the Grand- Canyon in Arizona and, down past The Needles. But at this time of, the year, after passing the mouth of the Gila,, instead of the red river it becomes the brown, river. It actually looks today as if ten per, cent of its How was silt and only ninety "per, cent water., RICHES OF SOIL WONDERFUL, But the object of this story is to call atten, tion once more, and for perhaps the thou, sandth time, to the riches of the soil along, the Colorado on both sides, incident to the, depositidg of this mass of debris during all, the past ages. Going through the country, on the Arizona side of the river, for several, miles below Yuma, one encounters the same, type of country and soil that is found in the, Imperial Valley country around Braw\'ey,, Calexico and other points west of the river, The fertility of the black prairie soils of Illi, nois has astonished people engaged in agri, culture for nearly one hundred years. The, fertility of the valleys of the Nile has been a, matter of history for at least COCO years. Those, who are familinr with Illinois prairie soil,, and thoe who know what the valley of the, Nile is\'for agriculture, khow that this lower, Colorado River region surpasses both of them., If you ask a farmer along this stretch of, country if Hie soil is six feet, his e3es will, open with astonishment ai your ignorance., He will tell you no one knows whether it is, 00 feet, GCO or ii.000 Teet deep. It is practically, without bottom. It is so thoroughly well, mixed with sand, disintegrated granite and, other rocks that it never breaks. It is as, easily worked as a heap of ashes, and re, sponds to cultivation in a way that is mar, velous. CUT SEVEN CHOI\'S YEARLY., Arizona has established an experiment, station in the heart of this big valley, which, is some twenty-four miles long, and in spots, ten to twelve miles wide, down on the lower, level. The results arc wonderful. Last week, they were cutting a crop of alfalia on this ex, perimental farm, and for seven consecutive, mouths they will cut succeeding crops. The, only months when the crop is not cut here are, Deeenfbcr and January., Cotton and tobacco grow with the greatest, luxuriance, and this rich alluvial soil will be, noted in a very few years as the ideal spot in, the whole country for dairying, hog raising,, the production of poultry and vegetables, which, one hesitates to call early or late, as they will !, be perennial. New potatoes will be produced, in the middle of January, tomatoes will be, ripe by the first of March, ripe grapes will be, gathered in the early days of May, and apri, cots by the middle of the same month. Chic, kens nna turkeys flourish there inthe winter, time beyond all experience anywhere else., The rainfall is exceedingly light and comes, only three or four times in a whole winter., With an abundance of green alfalfa nnd veget, AWtfsi the dry and uai overcuicd climate", prevailing in the winter months, chickens arc, free from the disease that make their raisin, difllcult elsewhere. There is no spot in South, ern Illinois or Missouri so adapted to the pro, duction of corn as this valley along the Colora, do River. With alfalfa and corn, the butter., cheese, eggs, poultry amf pork to be raised on a, twenty-acre farm will amaze those who have, the experience in American agricultural affairs, The winter climate around Yuma is a thing, so intoxicatingly salubrious lhat no words can, ucscriDe.it,. Tiiose ueserts or America, as we, hav6 regarded them heretofore, seem to defy, the ills that human nature elsewhere is so, prone to controct and-suffer from. The atmos, phere is as dry as punk, the skies \' cloudlessly, ciear, inc air mna as possie-ie, and every, breath seems to be an inspiration of new .life., The United States has an experiment, farm on, the mesa just on the outskirts of Yuma. Here, ults even more marvelous than in the valley, are produced. Down on the lower levels there, are little nips of frosty mornings occasionally, during December and January, but on the mesa, the breath of frost never touches the most del, Icate vegetation. Oranges grown at the Feder, al experiment station are unsurpassed in their, delicious quality., i uma is a busy, up-to-date town. The more, modern improvements consist of several blocks, of attractive brick buildings, a three-story post, office building, also of brick, and many other, nice structures. Among some of the greater, improvements which arc being made, arc a, ?:i5,000 school building, a STo.OOO ice plant, a, line club-house for the railroad employes,, Kirger passeuger depot, and the probability of, a new court house to cost $75,000. There iscon, siderablcljusiness done there, but the people, have not begun to aw?ken to the vast possibili, ties of the place. They should at once erect an, up-to-date tourist hotel. It should have ample, grounds around it and be planted with all, kinds -al tropical vegetation. If atmosphere, were only transportable like mineral waters,, and one could send consignments of this Yuma, winter air to the East, the inspiration of its, health-giving qualities would bring 25.000, tourists every winter to the banks of the .Colo, rado River., Yuma needs only to make known its climatic, attractions in the parts of the East swept every, year by blizzsrds and snowstorms to attract, city full every winter. The fertility of the val, ley below will almost make itsclr known with, out effort oir the part of the people. But.with a, valley full of intelligent and industrious rural, population, producing fruits and vegetable;, poultry, eggs, fresh milk and fragrant butter,, Yuma should be one of the most deHghtful, winter resorts\' in ail America. There is every, thing there to furnish tourists with the most, healthfnl and declicious food, and if the air in, that region docs not drive doctors to seek a, living elsewhere, it will be because the people, do not know how to live properly., The Laguna Dam will be completed in 1909,, andir. ten years frbm today the attractions of, Yuma as a health resort and the fertility of, these bottom lands will be so well known that, it will require SI.000 in cash to\'buy a single, acre of it., There is more catarrh in this section, of the country than all other diseases, put. together, and until the hist few, yeans was supposed to be incuraMe. For, a frrcat many years doctors pronounced, it a local disease and prescribed local, remedies, and by constantly failing to, cure with local treatment, pronounced, it incurable. Science h as proven catarrh, to be a constitutional disease and there, fore requires constitutional treatment., Hall\'s Catarrh (Jure, manufactured by, b J. Cheney & Co.. Toledo, Ohio, is, \'the only constitutional cure on the, market. It is taken internally in doses, from 10 drops to a teaspoonful. It acts, directly on the blood and mucous sur, faces of the system. They offer- one, hundred dollars for any case it fails to, cure. Send for circulars and testimon, ials. Address, K. J.
