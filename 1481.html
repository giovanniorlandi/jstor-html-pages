        <pre>['C H A P T E R  V \nPILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nN. E. KULLMAN, JR. \nProfessor of Education \nState Teachers College \nPlattsburgh, New York \nand \nJULI2~N E. BUTTERWORTtt \nProfessor of Rural Education \nCornell University \nIthaca, New.York \nINTRODUCTION \nIn education, as in all human endeavor, continued progress depends \na great deal upon superior experimental, forward-looking programs. In \nthese programs original steps are taken to cope with and to solve existing \nproblems, and a constant process of evaluation is carried on. By describ- \ning these superior programs to interested persons one can facilitate more \nrapid progress. This is one way to reduce the gap between theory and \npractice, between the ideal and the actual. Accordingly, the main objec- \ntive of this chapter is to enlarge our educational horizon through a study \nof a few outstanding rural-school programs. \nAs a consequence of significant changes in our economic and social \nlife, the role of the school in the life of the community has become in- \ncreasingly important. The school is a social agency and must be con- \nstantly alert to meet new conditions and new demands. The lag that \nexists between ideals and knowledge, on the one hand, and performance, \non the other, is a well-known phenomenon that is a challenge to the edu- \ncators and the people of any society. \nIn this chapter the reader will find descriptions of actual school situa- \ntions where improved, sometimes radical, methods and techniques have \nbeen used successfully. The reader will gain a vision of what may be done \nin any rural community toward improving its educationa! program. The \ndescriptions include suggestions for dealing with knotty problems. They \npresent both common and unusual obstacles faced by rural educators \nand rural communities and call attention to forces at work in the de- \nvelopment of better programs. They put special emphasis upon the \nunique circumstances that conditioned the development of the respec- \ntive programs. Thus, others may profit from the experiences of these \neducational pioneers. \n123 \n', '124 P I L O T  P R O G R A M S  I N  R U R A L  E D U C A T I O N  \nThe following method was used in selecting the programs to be pre- \nâ€¢ sented: The authors developed a check list of superior educational prac- \ntices. Copies of this check list were sent to leaders in rural education with \na request for the names of schools which they considered to be superior, \naccording to the items listed. Copies of the same check list were then \nsent to be filled out by the schools suggested. All check sheets were then \ncompared and programs were selected on the basis of being (a) unique, \n(b) especially well adapted to the given circumstances, and (c) representa- \ntive of different kinds of situations and procedures. The literature was \nreviewed to avoid including descriptions of programs already published. \nFinally, arrangements were made with each school to obtain an account \nof the developme/lt of its program. This account was written by a person \nintimately connected with the program. \nThe programs here described are not represented as the best now in \noperation. They were chosen as examples because they have a number of \nsuperior features. Although, in general, they are sound and forward look- \ning, no program is considered to be superior in every respect. The authors \nhave not tried to cull out practices that might fail to win general pro- \nfessional approval. The programs are presented as illustrations of actual \npractice, and the authors, after summarizing outstanding features at the \nend of each account, have reserved for the reader the duty of assessing its \nindividual elements according to his own standards. \nSEVEN PROGRAMS DESCRIBED \nI \nTHE REBIRTH OF A ONE-R00M SCHOOL \nEDI~ M. BR~CKO~ \nTeacher, Lewiston School \nLewiston, New York \nThe Schoolhouse. Twenty-odd years ago, the exterior of "Hickory \nCollege" (as it is affectionately called) looked very much as it does now. \nThe interior, however, has undergone a metamorphosis. \nI t  is a rectangular stone building, approximately 24 by 30 feet, built \nin 1842. I t  stands in a grove of hickory trees. When the writer first went \nthere to teach, its interior was depressing, indeed. The walls of plaster on \nstone were painted a dull gray and gathered so much moisture that the \nnew hardwood floor had buckled. The teacher\'s desk and chair stood on \na platform 8 or 10 inches in height in the front of the room. A single \nsl~aky bookcase stood in one corner. As many desks as possible were \ncrowded into the rest of the room, leaving some space in the center for \nthe old pot-bellied stove. No artificial light was available, and the many \n', 'I \nKULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 125 \ntreesabout the school prevented the sunshine from coming in at the deep- \nly recessed windows. \nThe Community. The community at that time was almost wholly agri- \ncultural in character. The farmers found i t  profitable to take much of \ntheir produce to the Niagara Falls market about eight miles away. Some \nof the younger men worked in the chemical plants in that city. Nearly \nevery family owned an automobile of some description; these were the \nonly means of transportation with the exception of a bus line that still \nruns from Youngstown, through Lewiston, to Niagara Falls. The in- \nhabitants were hard-working people of American stock, most of whom \nowned their farms. \nLewiston, a village of about 900 at that time, had three churchesq \nCatholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian. The Grange was inactive. A few \nof the farmers belonged to the Farm Bureau and some of their wi;ces \nparticipated in the Home Bureau. None of these organizations seemed to \nbe very much alive. \nThe "Old" School Situation. The school was under the control of a sole \ntrustee, elected each year. The annual school meeting for electing the \ntrustee and working out the budget was poorly attended. Many times \nsomeone had to go out and bring in neighbors so that a quorum would \nbe present. \nSeveral of the children who should have been attending "Hickory \nCollege" went to the Lewiston Union School because their parents \nthought that they would receive a better education there. The people of \nthe community didn\'t have the money to improve the school or else they \nlacked interest in it--probably the latter. \nThe School Changes. The new teacher was a stranger in the commu- \nnity and had signed the contract without seeing the school. She had \ntaught in a rural school for four years. When she entered "Hickory Col- \nlege" that first day, the condition of the room made her wonder why she \nwas there. But she immediately began to interest the children in making \nthe room a brighter, happier place in which to live, work, and learn. \nCurtains made of crepe paper, attractive pictures properly mounted, \nflowers and bright-colored berries from near-by fields .and woods did \nmuch to make the room cheerier. The children\'s enthusiasm for studying \nthe wild flowers was a ioy to see. They had never been on a field trip \nand knew little abot~t the plant life around them. The very real and in- \nteresting study of the plants which was the outgrowth of this experience \nprobably taught the teacher as much as it did the children. \nThat first year was discouraging. Though the parents were invited to \nvisit several times, only three or four mothers accepted, and these few \nwere shy and acted as though they were afraid of the teacher. The teacher \n', '126 PILOT PROGRAMS IN  RURAL EDUCATION \nreceived no word. of encouragement. However, at the regular school \nmeeting in the spring, it was voted to install electric lights and a new \nstove. Since the children had always been required to buy their own \nbooks, it was going to take several years to procure the necessary ma- \nterials for them to use. Accordingly, the teacher requested a few materi- \nals, which were purchased. She did not dare ask for too much at once; \nshe realized it was better to proceed slowly. \nDuring the second year, the school-lunch program was initiated. The \npupils raised enough money by selling bittersweet to buy bowls, plates, \nkettles, and an electric hot-plate. Each child brought meat or vegetables \nfrom home, which were made into delicious soups. The pupils had much \nfun preparing the food and washing the dishes. They developed a genuine \nspirit of living happily together, with each person doing his share. The \nhealth program that was built up around this interest had real meaning \nthat it could have acquired in no better way. \nAs parents came to visit or to bring something for lunch, they became \ninterested enough to raise money to buy a kitchen cabinet in which to \nkeep the dishes. \nThe attempts of the children and teacher to improve the school evi- \ndently made the patrons think; at the next yearly meeting, they voted to \nremodel the building and to build an addition so that inside toilets could \nbe installed. Earlier it would have been thought impossible to raise \n$1,200 for a school project by taxation in one year, but this was done. \nThe room itself was made warmer and more attractive by the installation \nof wall board painted a light buff. When the children and teacher re- \nturned to school the next fall, they were happy, indeed. \nThere were eight grades in the school. The enrolment had grown until \nthere were about forty children in all. Even children from the village of \nLewiston began to attend. It  soon became necessary to refuse these out- \nsiders. \nAbout this time, the New York State College for Teachers at Buffalo \ninstituted a rural department and became interested in "Hickory Col- \nlege." Soon, students from the teacher\'s college were getting their rural \nteaching experience here and the children were profiting through new \ncontacts and ideas. Some of the parents were skeptical about these \nyoung student teachers, but when they came to observe the various pro- \ngrams and saw the results of the teaching, they changed their minds. \nThey have encouraged the use of student teachers ever since. \nAfter the depression years, there was a shift of population to the city; \nfor one year there were only nine children in the school. Then the shift \nto the country began, and soon the school was filled to overflowing. One \nby one, the grades were sent elsewhere until at the present time "Hickory \nCollege" houses only the first grade. \n', 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 127 \nDuring the depression years, the teacher endeavored to start a Mothers\' \nClub to promote newer ideas of teaching and child development. Most of \nâ€¢ the mothers knew very little about such things, and it required a great \ndeal of education combined with entertainment to keep them together. \nLittle by little, as the club expanded, fathers grew interested and be- \ncame regular attendants. Then someone suggested that it become a com- \nmunity club, including not only parents but anyone in the near-by area \nwho was interested in the school and community. Today the club is a \ncenter of interest; at its last meeting, a study of the history of the area \npacked the little school until there was standing room only. \nThe teacher believes firmly that real learning comes through doing. \nNo matter what the  subject or what the age or capability of the child, \nreal interest should be followed by action on the part of the learner. This \naction may include the following learning experiences: listing things to \nbe found out; reading related materials; asking questions of parents, \nfriends, and teachers; visiting near-by places; collecting exhibits of re- \nlated materials and labeling the materials; looking at pictures, movies, \nand film strips; discussing various phases of the subject; listening to \nstories, songs, and plays; dramatizing; illustrating an interest by means \nof paintings, drawings, original stories, and experience charts; and mak- \ning modelsâ€¢ From these .activities even the slowest learner derives at \nleast a little that is worth while. This type of program must enlist the \nhelp of the parents. Their co-operation is easily obtained because every \nparent is interested in his child\'s welfare and is proud to contribute such \nknowledge and materials as he has. The teacher is often amazed at the \nvariety of the exhibits collected and the willingness of parents to help. \nUnder a program of this type, the children are happy, inquisitive, and \neager to learn; they are good citizens in their school. This kind of pupil \ncontrol encourages the child to become an individual who can think for \nhimself, accept responsibility, and have consideration for the group as a \nwhole through self-chosen action in guided activities. \nThis type of teaching is not easy. It  requires understanding, willing- \nness to work long hours, and the ability to see the capabilities of each \nchild and to help him develop them to the fullest extent. For example, \nin a Unit on "clothing," a little red-headed, cross-eyed boy in the second \ngrade wanted to give a report on silk. Though his defective eyesight and \npoor co-ordination made reading difficult for him, he  was able, with the \nhelp of his parents, to give an excellent report on the silkworm and the \nmanufacture of silk goods. When he had finished he said, "Do  you have \nany .questions you want to ask me?" He waited, and, when no one ques- \ntioned him, he said, "I guess they know all about silk now." What satis- \nfaction on his part! \nMany teachers will say, "Yes, but what about reading, writing, and \n', '128 PILOT PROGRAMS I N  RURAL EDUCATION \nanthmetm. All these become more meaningful. The child who is slow \nin reading realizes how necessary it is to be able to read in order that he \nmay enioy to the fullest his opportunities to contribute to the program \nand to become a more acceptable member of the group. \nThe satisfaction which the teacher enjoys when using this type of \nprogram more than repays her for the work it requires. When she sees \nthe children she has taught become leaders in high school and, later, in \ncollege, she is sure that this kind of teaching will help produce better, \nmore responsible citizens. \nOutstanding Features of Lewiston Program \nThis word picture of "Hickory College" amply illustrates the "multi- \nplier effect" of a vigorous and far-seeing personality upon a small com- \nmunity or neighborhood. The school has regained its place as an effective \nforce in a sociological pattern. I t  is no longer a stagriant institution striv- \ning to serve outmoded purposes; it has adapted itself to the changes of \nlife. \nThe most striking of the elements of this story are the change in the \ncurriculum and the emphasis upon child development through guided \nexperiences. The whole community became a laboratory for learning. \nThe lives of adults, too, were enriched by their active interest in educa- \ntion. This account also shows how a teachers\' college may at the same \ntime be helped to serve its function and to meet a rural teacher\'s needs. \nI I  \nARTS AND INDUSTRIES LABORATORY FOR \nA ONE-ROOM RURAL SCHOOL \nLuex JOHNSON \nTeacher, Hanover School \nPolk County, Iowa \nThe Setting of the School. Some of the best farmland in Iowa is located \njust west of the city of Des Moines in Polk County. The people are most- \nly farmers, but a small minority are folk who have come to Walnut \nTownship in order to build a good home in the open country. \nWalnut Township is a long, narrow school district running from one- \nhalf mile north of Highway 6, on the north, south to the Raccoon River, \na distance of about six miles. I t  is three miles wide, bounded on the east \nby West Des Moines and on the west by the country districts in the next \ncounty of Dallas. \nThe people are practically all of old American stock. They have the \nadvantage of living within a fifteen-minute drive of Des Moines and have \ngood 4-H, agricultural extension, and Farm Bureau programs. Some of \n', "KULLMAN AND .BUTTERWORTH 129 \nthe men are members of service clubs ]n Des Moines ancl West Des \nMoines. Several women are interested in the Art Center located in the \nwestern part of Des Moines proper. \nThe township district was originally divided into several subdistricts, \neach maintaining a one-room country school; now it maintains but three \none-room schools. Transportation to these schools is provided for the \ngrade children, and all the high-school students are transported to Valley \nHigh School at West Des Moines. During the last fifteen years there has \nbeen considerable improvement in the one-room schools. Modern build- \nings, the best of equipment, and the very best in teachers have become \nthe accepted standards. A county-wide workshop sponsored in each of \nthe last three years by the county superintendent has inspired a better \narts and crafts program in all the schools of Polk County. \nThis story is written about the Hanover school, one of the remaining \none-room institutions in the township district. It presents a word picture \nof, the typical activities that take place in this school, describing pro- \ncedures, pupil-teacher planning, and the results attained. It tells what \nHanover did about its limited equipment and describes the integration \nof interest and effort that resulted. \nThe Hanover School Laboratory. In the fall of 1949 the Hanover pupils \ndecided to sponsor some type of project which would improve their \nschool and which could become a permanent feature of its program, for \nfuture years. They compiled a list of projects in which they were inter- \nested. These activities were then discussed both at home and at school. \nThe youngsters talked the problem over with their parents, the P.T.A. \npresident, and the cook in the school lunchroom. One of the activities \nlisted was the development of a small shop. Some of the parents have \nsmall shops in their basements, and the pupils had heard about the shop \nat the Woodside School, a large independent rural high school that main- \ntains a demonstration arts and industry laboratory for the whole county. \nThe pupils eventually decided to install and equip a small shop in the \nschool basement where there was adequate space for such an activity. \nOf course, such a project would require funds. A magazine-subscrip- \ntion sale netted some funds. One of the farmers suggested that he would \nlike to have the loose corn picked up from a cornfield and that he would \ngive his time and labor, working with the pupils. Another adult couple \nin the neighborhood also helped, and all the money thus raised was con- \ntributed to the shop fund. With the community's participation, the \ntreasury was now beginning to grow. \nHowever, the pupils still needed to secure the backing and help of \nthe school board. In November, 1949, there was a joint meeting of mem- \nbers of the school board, Mr. Ralph Norris, County Superintendent, \n", '130 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nMr. W. F. Ditzler, of Iowa State Teachers College, and the teacher, \nMiss Lucy Johnson. Mr. Ditzler, an instructor in industrial arts, and \nMr. Norris explained how the plan could become a part of the curriculum \nand could also teach the pupils how to live and work together democrati- \ncally. \nWith this go-ahead signal from the board, the youngsters really began \nworking three shifts a day on plans for a shop. Parents remarked that \nconversation at the supper hour usually led to talk about the shop. Plan- \nning by parents,  pupils, and teachers became a definite part of this \nactivity. \nCould it be integrated with the curriculum? Language, arithmetic, \nhealth, science, social studies, and spelling lessons began to flourish. \nCommittees had to be formed, measurements had to be made of the area \nin the basement; some were accurate and others badly in error, but that \nwas a part of the learning process. Letters had to be written, and dis- \ncussion periods lengthened. Common talk became shop talk. \nAfter getting suggestions from their parents about the tools necessary \nfor a small shop, the pupils compiled a list and sent it to Mr. Ditzler for \nhis criticism and suggestion. They made arrangements with the driver of \nthe school bus to take the entire group, Grades I through VIII, to a tool \nfirm recommended by their parents. ThE pupils wanted to compare \nprices, inquire about the materials used in the tools, and listen to an ex- \nplanation of their use by the storekeeper, who had handled tools for \nmany years. Mr. Hyland, who had been secretary of the school board for \nthirty-three years, accompanied the pupils and teacher on this trip to \ngive his opinion and practical viewpoint. \nA supper was held to raise more funds and to give the parents a better \nview of why this activity was being sponsored. Furnished with this \nbackground, the parents responded very generously. Mr. Ityland do- \nnated his time in building a wall panel for the tools. The older boys \nhelped to install it, and then remodeled an old table to serve as the work- \nbench. The tools were assembled in their proper places on the wall \npanel. Orange crates, apple boxes, and all types of lumber were brought \nfrom home to be used in setting up the shop. Approximately $96 was \nspent by the pupils and the school board for the shop equipment. Par- \nents and other members of the community have co-operated with t h e  \npupils to the fullest extent to make this a successful activity. Shopwork \nhas become a permanent part of the curriculum. \nEvaluation of the Program. Although no systematic evaluation has \nbeen attempted, observation of the children and aclults indicates height- \nened interest in the school and increased ability to work together. With \nthe increased mechanization of agriculture and the necessity for many \n', 'K U L L M A N  AND B U T T E R W O R T H  131 \nrural young people to engage in industry, the need for instruction and \npractice in the use of tools becomes evident. Moreover, the shopwork \nprovides activity in which the nonacademic child can be successful and \nhappy. There are many far-reaching possibilities for this type of pupil- \nteacher, community planning. \nOutstanding Features of Hanover School \nAn emphasis on child development through an integrated curriculum \nStands out in this program. Equally outstanding is the community sup- \nport of the project. The importance of the county standard of securing \n"the best in teachers" and providing for their growth in service should \nnot be underestimated. \nIII, \n0AKMONT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL \nELIZABETtI DUNN \nPrincipal, Oakmont Elementary School \nDickson, Tennessee \nThe School, Its Community, and Its New Plant. Oakmont Elementary \nSchool is located in Dickson, in middle Tennessee, about forty miles \nwest of Nashville. It is a community with a population of approximately \n3,500. It  is situated on one of the main railroad lines in the state and is \nthe junction point for a branch line. For many years Dickson was known \nas a "railroad town" because so many railroad workers lived here. Two \nU.S. highways pass through the town. \nThe community has a water plant, a sewage system, and gets elec- \ntricity from the T.V.A. Many new electric lines are being constructed in \nthe rural sections. Natural gas was made available to the town a year \nago by means of a connection with one of the large pipe lines that \ncrosses the county. \nDickson has eight churches; a high school; a memorial building which \nhouses the public library and serves as a meeting place; a U.S. armory \nbuilding; two theaters; a golf course; four factories which furnish jobs \nto several hundred pe )ple from the town and outlying areas; two clinics \nwhich offer the services of seven doctors (surgeons included), four den- \ntists, and two optometrists; a county health clinic rendering free serv- \nices; four community playgrounds; and a local paper, published weekly, \nwhich has been very liberal in _allowing space for reporting school \nactivities. \nThe people of Dickson have access to Montgomery Bell State Park, \njust six miles away, for camping, picnicking, swimming, and fishing. \n', '132 PILOT PROGRAMS IN  RURAL EDUCATION \nThere are a number of civic organizations and study clubs that promote \ncivic improvement and recreation. The Municipal Concert Association \npresents out-of-town artists duringthe winter season. The tri-county \n\'dairy festival held in the community each year was started by a local \norganization. Another organization awards money prizes to the rural \ncommunities in the county that make the greatest improvements during \nthe year. The Saddle and Bridle Club has trail rides each week and \nsponsors a horse show each year. During the summer a club sponsors \nsoftball games. The Athletic Club promotes and backs athletics at the \nhigh school. The club-sponsored projects mentioned arc just a few of the \nmany activities carried on for the betterment of the community: \nThe surrounding country contains neighborhoods and small commu- \nnities as well as small farms, pasture lands, and woodland. Truck farm- \ning and dairy farming are important enterprises along with the raising \nof corn, hay, small grain, potatoes, and tobacco. \nThe people in these communities belong to progressive community \nclubs. Their programs include such topics as making better use of land \nresources: terracing, planting winter cover crops, sowing small grains, \nusing modern equipment, raising thoroughbred cattle, improving poultry \nflocks; building new homes and barns, repairing and remodeling homes; \nimproving the general appearance of the community; fencing, erecting \nroad signs, and putting names on mailboxes; promoting rural electrifica- \ntion and buying electrical equipment; and helping tenants to become \nland-owners. Members of home demonstration clubs learn new methods \nof preparing and serving food, canning, needlework, handicraft, interior \ndecorating, furniture remodeling, and lawn beautification. Community\' \nfairs and picnics are held. Another popular form of recreation is the folk \ngame. A representative from the University of Tennessee Extension \nService has come to the county on numerous occasions to direct these \ngames. Leaders of community activities have developed in the rural \nclubs. The participants have bought their own loud speakers and record \nplayers to enliven their recreational programs. \nOakmont School comprises Grades I through VI and has an enrolment \nof 520 pupils. The school is served by six buses which transport a large \nnumber of rural children from the surrounding area. \nThe new plant has been occupied for one year. It is a one-story brick \nstructure extending 560 feet in length. The inside walls are of building \nstone. The floors are of concrete, covered with asphalt tile everywhere \nexcept in the corridors. The corridor ceilings are metal. There are four- \nteen classrooms, a combination cafeteria and recreation room, clinic, \nteachers\' room, and offices. Future plans call for an auditorium and addi- \ntional classrooms. This building has been called "the most modern in \nthe South." \n', "KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 133 \nThe classrooms get natural lighting from two sides. The rooms are \nequipped with blond furniture, green chalk-boards, built-in bulletin \nboards and bookcases. There is a large closet in each room for teaching \nsupplies. Each of the rooms in the primary wing has a fountain, a lava- \ntory-cabinet combination, restrooms for boys and for girls, and a work \ncounter extending across one side of the room. Each room in the other \nwing has a built-in bookcase across the entire back of the room. This \ncontains shelves for books, cabinet space, a magazine rack, and space to \ndisplay science collections. This piece of equipment was designed by the \nteachers to meet specific needs and was obtained, by funds raised in \nvarious ways by the teachers, the children, and their parents. \nThere are two playgrounds, one for the smaller children and one for the \nolder ones. Play periods of thirty minutes each come in the afternoon \nand are staggered by grades so that relatively few are on the playground \nat one time and so that all of the children may have an opportunity to \nenjoy the equipment. \nI t  might be of interest to note that the only pieces of equipment placed \nin the building by the school board were the teachers' desks and chairs, \nsteel lockers for wraps, and the children's seating, which consists of chair \ndesks in all grades except the first, where there are tables and chairs. All \nother equipment was provided through the interest, the hard work, and \nâ€¢ the co-operation of the people in the community. \nMany of the parents worked for days helping the teachers get the \nbuilding in readiness for the dedication and open house. This was an \nevent to which everybody had looked forward for a long time. The P.T.A. \nserved tea in the cafeteria. In addition to people from the county, many \ncame from elsewhere in the state. \nTwo years ago the first school carnival was held. This was an all-out \neffort to raise money to equip the cafeteria. The festivities started in the \nafternoon with a colorful parade through the business section in which \nboth children and adults in costume competed in various classes, repre- \nsenting storybook characters, comic-strip characters, patriots, and \nclowns. Every imaginable form of amusement was to be found at the \ncarnival, which was held out of doors. This school project marked a \nchange in community attitude. All the people became interested and \ntook an active part. Not one penny of public funds was spent in prepara- \ntion for the carnival: time, labor, materials, food--everything was do- \nnated. For instance, the town of Dickson furnished the electricity and \nwater and two men to do the wiring. A local bus company furnished free \ntransportation. Rather than sell any form of advertising, those in charge \nasked for cash donations, and the merchants responded generously. The \ntotal proceeds were $3,500, with over $2,000 in cash donations. Modern \nkitchen equipment and a beautiful lunchroom were the result. \n", "134 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nThe carnival was such a huge success, and everybody had so much fun \nthat it was made an annual affair. Proceeds from the second carnival \npaid for Venetian blinds for the building. Even now, people are planning \nand looking forward'to the next one. \nThrough the generosity of local business people, the school was able to \nsecure equipment at a great reduction in cost not only for the cafeteria \nbut for the entire building. \nFunds raised by the school in co-operatibn with parents and others in \nthe community have paid for library tables and chairs for each room, \nrecord players for each room, a new piano~ a projector, a portable stage, \noffice equipment, and mmaerous other supplies. The powder room adjoin- \ning the girls' restroom was furnished by the American Legion Auxiliary. \nThe school flag was presented in memory of a war casualty. Six men's \norganizations bought the letters which form the name of the school. A \ngroup of ladies collected favorite recipes and published cookbooks, on \nwhich they realized $1,500. Two separate sets of playground equipment \nwere bought with this money. Fortunately there is an active Parent- \nTeacher Association. Even though it is not the policy of the organization \nto purchase equipment for schools, this group considered the needs of a \nnew building an exception to the rule. They gave a large refrigerator and \nfurnishings for the teachers' room and the clinic. Their next project is to \nbeautify the grounds. \nTo raise money, students and teachers have sold candy, conducted \nfood markets, served dinners, sold Christmas and other cards, presented \nprograms, and operated a school supply store in the office. Some schools \nadvocate doing without things in order to force the school board to \nsupply them. This school preferred not to wait for materials and equip- \nment which the children need now. These money-making projects have \nbeen mentioned because they show what a large part the community has \nplayed in providing so many advantages for the children. \nAlthough the building has been in use only one year, four additional \nclassrooms are being built at the present time. There are three sections \neach of the first and second grades, and two sections each of the other \ngrades. There is need of three sections in the third and fourth grades, and \na larger first-grade enrolment is anticipated. \nA Testing Program. One element of the school program of which its \nstaff is especially proud is the testing l~rogram. As well as constituting \none excellent means of supervision, it has facilitated the staff's efforts to \nraise the standards of the school. This program has been in effect for six \nyears. Reading tests are given three times a year in the first three grades \nand twice a year in the upper grades. Metropolitan tests are used in the \nlower grades, Stanford Achievement tests in the upper grades. Children \n", "â€¢ KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 135 \nare grouped according to their reading ability in at least three level~ per \ngrade. Workbooks and many other forms of supplementary materials \nare used. Weaknesses in other subjects are detected and remedied.When \nthis program was started, class medians were far below the grade levels \nin which the children were placed. This year the sixth-grade median was \nequal to seventh-grade norms. These are the same children with whom \nthe program was started six years ago; the results prove that time and \neffort have been well spent. The same kind of results prevailed through- \nout the school. Improvement in all other subjects resulted from improved \nreading. \nCumulative records, profile charts, and individual folders containing \nsamples of each pupil's work are kept throughout the grades. When a \nchild is not making satisfacto .ry progress, it is the school's policy to have \nthe parents come to the school for consultation. Parents are welcome to \ncome at any time but are called in at the first signs of poor work. Samples \nof the children's work are sent home regularly to be checked, signed, and \nreturned. There has been splendid co-operation and understanding on the \npart of parents. \nTests disclosed a ~geakness in arithmetic fundamentals which may \nhave been partly caused by the use of different books varying in content \nfrom grade to grade. The staff followed the state educational bulletin \nand worked out a list of required fundamentals for each grade. This, too, \nhas proven its worth. \nSince the testing program also showed that the children were weak ]n \nliterature, a guided literature program was introduced. Beginning with \nthe first grade, children are exposed to a required list of stories, poems, \nand books, which they read by themselves or which are read to them by \nthe teacher. In addition, they select and read books of their own choice. \nAfter only two years of this program, improvement is already evident. \nThe lists are still being revised as certain literature is found better suited \nto a certain grade, or as some books prove too difficult for some children. \nThere is a library in each classroom, complete with reference books \nand encyclopedia. The school has built up these libraries over a period of \nyears by charging a book fee each year and augmenting the returns by \nmoney from other funds: The school has access to a public library in the \ntown and also to a traveling regional library. \nTeaching Writing and Other Fundamentals. The staff members decided \nthat they were doing a poor job of teaching handwriting. Some teachers \nwere using one form, while other teachers were using another. This \npractice caused the children to change from year to year and retarded \ntheir progress. Now the same system of handwriting books is used \nthroughout the school. The cards that go with these books are mounted \n", '136 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nin every room. Several faculty meetings devoted to a discussion of letter \nforms helped the members to improve their teaching methods. They \nsearched for practice sheets that would be of help to the children but \ncould find none. Then they drew up their own form and tried to get it \nprinted at several companies. Finally, this year, with the help of the \ncounty supervising teacher, they found a company to print it. Next year \nmembers of the faculty are going to work ifi a similar way on spelling \nand word meaning. \nInstruction in Music. Music is stressed in the school. There is a large \nrecord library which is used to teach appreciation, rhythm, and singing \nand playing games. Periods for group singing with piano accompaniment \nare provided in each grade. In those grades where the teacher does not \nplay an instrument, parents come regularly to accompany the singing. A \nrhythm band is a feature of the lower grades. \nInstruction in Speech. The speech director has contributed a great deal \nto the program. She comes to the school two days a week to give both \nindividual and group lessons. She has been voted the outstanding coach \nof the year by the National Forensic League. Her pupils have won na- \ntional honors. \nHelping the Handicapped. A number of handicapped children receive \nfree special training and medical care. The polio victims who are not able \nto attend school regularly are taught at home by teachers after regular \nschool hours. A specially trained person works with those having speech \ndefects, deafness, or poor eyesight. A men\'s club furnishes spectacles to \nthose children who cannot afford them. The local dentists give a large \nnumber of hours during the year to free dental care. Physical examina- \ntions and immunizations are given to every child before he enters the \nfirst grade. Booster immunizations are given through the years. A com- \nmittee of the P.T.A. sees that no child suffers for lack of clothing. Over \nfifty children receive free lunches in the lunchroom. \nAssistance from the P.T.A. Within the P.T.A. organization is a group \nknown as "Room Mothers," a committee with representatives for each \nroom who stand by to help on any occasion. They serve refreshments and \ngive favors on Hallowe\'en and Valentine\'s Day. They remember the \nroom and the teacher with gifts and make life pleasant in general. Under \ntheir sponsorship a special day is set aside each year as "Teacher Ap- \npreciation Day" when the teachers are sent flowers and gifts. In appre- \nciation for the many things Jwhieh they had done for the school during \nthe past year, the faculty entertained these mothers and the P.T.A. \nofficers at a dinner. The fellowship enjoyed by this group of one hundred \nwas proof of a fine school-community spirit. \nThe P.T.A. keeps a scrapbOok each year and submits it in a state con- \n', 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 137 \ntest. Local teachers have been awarded several scholarships to colleges \nin recognition of the excellence of these scrapbooks. They contain clip- \npings, souvenirs, and snapshots of many activities. Pictures of the teach- \ners, class groups, room mothers, and officers are also included. After the \ncontest the books are presented to the school to be kept as a record \nthrough the years. \nOther Educational Activities. Every year certain famous paintings are \nstudied in each grade. This past year this project was carried over into \nan art exhibit held in town. After studying about the paintings they \nwere to see, the children were taken in groups to the exhibit. \nDuring Fire Prevention Week the fire chief brought a fire engine to the \nschool. A large bonfire was built and various types of extinguishers were \ndemonstrated to the children. \nOther interesting experiences include picnics, field trips for science \ncollections, a visit to the light and water station, a visit to the printing \noffice, a visit to a factory, and a bus trip by the older children to points \nof interest in Nashville. \nSince a large number of children come from rural communities, stress \nis placed on the advantages of rural life. The children become acquainted \nwith the various occupations in rural sections. Surrounding farms serve as \noutdoor laboratories. The children are taught to make use of their local \nland resources. Much of this work is done through the 4-H Club. Each \nchild in the fifth and sixth grades participates in 4-H Club work. The \nfirst project is on health. Other projects include personal grooming, care \nof the hair and clothing, remodeling clothing, home and room improve- \nment, care of poultry, gardening, conservation of the soil, improve- \nment of cattle, and record-keeping. In co-operation with their parents, \nthey learn more economical and more practical methods of farming and \nhomemaking. Several times during the year projects in the rooms turn \nout so well that the work is displayed in shop windows in town. This cre- \nates interest on the part of both children and adults. \nThe pupils are also active in Junior Red Cross work and particularly \nlike to fill boxes for children overseas. \nThe school is associated with the Federal Lunch Program and serves \na balanced plate with milk for twenty cents a day. All groceries and meats \nare bought wholesale. The school is able to buy meat wholesale because \na local butcher comes to the school and cuts it without charge. Over 95 \nper cent of the children participate in the lunch program, as part of which \nthey study foods, meal-planning, and table manners. \nCommunity Evaluation. The Oakmont School is a place where the \npeople of the community feel welcome to come for visits and for meet- \nings. They look on the school with pride. They enjoy showing it to visi- \n', '138 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \ntors. They sometimes come to have lunch with the pupils and teachers. \nNot many times during a school day can ohe walk through the building \nwithout seeing a parent. \nOutstanding Features of Oakmont School \nIn contrast with many other situations, this community initially had \ngreater financial resources and a larger number of social organizations, \nwhich were focused on the improvement of education. The Oakmont \nSchool has an exceptionally fine plant. The need of equipment for the \nnew building constituted a challenge .that was skilfully used to foster \nadult interest in the school program as a whole. A unique feature is the \n"Teacher Appreciation Day." \nOne evident emphasis in the Oakmont story is on community service \nto education. Parents raise funds to buy instructional materials and \nequipment, and they contribute their services to the improvement of \nthe activities program. They become intimately acquainted with their \nschool, and they are proud of the school and express their appreciation \nof the teachers. Through these activities they themselves grow socially. \nIn the school program itself, as judged by this description, much at- \ntention is given to the 3 R\'s. Provisions are made for meeting the needs \nof handicapped children. Tests are used as a means to an end, namely, \nto improve instruction; improved instruction, in turn, results in pro- \nficiency in the basic skills and in academic achievement. The pupils also \nlearn to improve their community and to live more fully in the present. \nThe Oakmont School is apparently trying also to pro~iide the experi- \nences needed for child development. The tools and skills of learning, \nappreciation of rural life, useful knowledge, enjoyment of the arts, and \ncommunity co-operation are its educational objectives. \nIV \nTHE MESICK CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL \nW. E. BAKER \nSuperintendent, Mesick Consolidated School \nMesiek, Michigan \nThe Setting. The Mesick Consolidated School is located in the small \nvillage of Mesick, Michigan, which has a population of about 350. Mesick \nhad its origin as a lumber town, and much of the surrounding area is \nowned by former lumber jacks and pioneer families. The soil is extremely \nsandy and poor for the most part, with localized areas of good soil. The \nfederal and state forest services each have thousands of acres in the \nschool district. \nFarming is the major occupation, but many people work for the high- \n', 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 139 \nway department, the railroad, the forest service, or in factories in ad- \nâ€¢ jacent cities. Some own small businesses, a gas station, a boat livery, or \ntourist cabins. \nThe village of Mesick is located about twenty-eight miles from \nTraverse City on the north (population 25,000) ; twenty-eight miles from \nCadillac on the south (population 10,000); and tweive miles from Man- \nton on the east (population 2,500). The community is served by the Ann \nArbor Railroad\'s three trunk lines and by two bus lines. The Manistee \nRive~" is suitable for boats and canoes. \nThe people are of many nationalities; no one group predominates. The \naverage economic level is quite low, and the adult educational level is \nsaid to be about sixth grade. Many "problem children" come from a clan \nof hill families. \nTwenty years ago when this project began, the village and commu- \nnity were ser~zed by an old country doctor. The County Health Unit pro- \nvided free health examinations to children, and a nurse visited the shhool \nperiodically to exclude cases of scabies, pediculosis, and impetigo. The \nrecreational facilities consisted of a poolroom, the usual outdoor sports of \nhunting and fishing, and lodge-sponsored card parties. Four churches \nserved the community. There were fraternal organizations such as the \nOdd Fellows, Rebekahs, Masonic Order, and Eastern Star. \nThe educational system consisted of a small town school with 180 stu- \ndents in Grades I to XII. The grade work emphasized the 3 R\'s, and the \nhigh-school curriculum was largely academic, except for agriculture and \nhome economics. A follow-up study of eighth-grade graduates showed \nthat many rural students failed to attend high school. Little use was \nmade of natural resources. Field trips by pupils and teachers were seldom \nmade. Children close to Mesick were picked up in horse-drawn, covered \nwagons. There was little thought that the school should be more than a \nplace for children to learn how to read, write, and figure. Out-of-school \neducational programs consisted chiefly of those sponsored by the \nCounty Agricultural agent and the Home Demonstration unit. \nThe New Educational Program. The new era in education and com- \nmunity service started in Mesick shortly after the present school ad- \nministrator came on the job twenty years ago as a combination superin- \ntendent and instructor in agriculture. \nOne complete township with five schools was consolidated during the \nfirst year; others folloWed, and now the district includes about two hun- \ndred square miles and serves a total area of four hundred square miles. \nFive hundred of the six hundred pupils are transported in eleven large \nbuses. The staff comprises twenty-four teachers in the day school plus \nten veterans\' institute instructors. \nThe board of education, elected after the consolidation, was quick to \n', "140 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nsense the need for a rejuvenated school program, and fortunately too'st \nof the original five continued to serve with the superintendent for twelve \nto fifteen years. For the most part, educational leadership was left to the \nsuperintendent, who worked closely with his faculty in planning and \nbringing about needed changes. Since the school was small, the superin- \ntendent did all within his power to establish a friendly working relation- \nship with the teachers. New personnel were selected, in part, on the basis \nof their estimated ability to get along with others. Small informal group \ndiscussions were held as opportunities arose during preschool and post- \nschool hours. \nFaculty meetingS, conferences, and workshops were also used. New \nideas were constantly suggested and acted upon. A policy of paying the \nexpenses of teachers who attend curriculum workshops was initiated by \nthe superintendent and adopted by the board of education. A faculty \ncurriculum committee was organized to aid in effecting desired changes. \nMinor modifications were adopted after favorable faculty discussion. \nAfter being accepted by the faculty, proposals ~nvolving greater changes \nwent to the board of education for approval. Then the students were \ntaken into the consultations, and the student council gave its attention \nto the plans. Faculty members utilized every possible parent contact to \nspread the news and collect reactions. Most changes were discussed with \nas many parents as possible and were well explained through a bi- \nweekly school paper. The approval and support of the education com- \nmittee of the Community School-Service Program was always secured \nafter action by the school board. The public seemed eager for any pro- \ngressive change, and few, if any, objections have been made. \nThe entire transition from a school Chiefly concerned with the 3 R's \nto a school concerned with service to the community has been made \ngradually. The first step was to have the agriculture students plant trees \nin eroded areas; they then pruned other trees, culled chickens, and land- \nscaped homes for citizens in the community. \nThe present school is like a university campus; it Consists of the original \nplant and modern additions: a separate shop building, a huge garage, a \nfield house, a community cannery, a rented lunch building, and a rented \ncommunity-school library. \nThe school owns about 1,600 acres of forest land from which Christmas \ntrees are sold each year--trees which have been planted by students. A \nwell-equipped printshop serves the community as well as offering valu- \nable instruction to students. The cannery operates the year around and \nprovides community patrons with a unique type of instruction as well \nas a convenient place !n which to can food in tin. Adult classes in shop, \nagriculture, homemaking, and other subjects are offered each year, and \n", 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 141 \nthe public calls upon the school at any time for assistance and service. \nSchool groups provide programs for granges, farm bureaus, and churches. \nUpon request the school provides outside agencies with free visual-aid \nservice in the form of moving pictures. \nCommunity institutes are sponsored each year for and by local citi- \nzens. The first institute started out as an "open house" for parents and \nwas sponsored by the educational committee of the Community School \nService Program. Its purpose was to tell the parents about the school." \nThe parents enjoyed themselves; the following year speakers and an \neducational moving picture were added. After a gradual growth the \nprogram has come to be centered upon two or three phases of community \nlife which are of current concern or interest: for example, health, recrea- \ntion, religion, conservation, education, or family life. The members of \nthe education committee select the topics, organize the program, and \nsecure the speakers under the leadership of their chairman, who is also \nchairman of the institute. They have also attempted evaluation through \nthe use of cards upon which patrons wrote their reactions. \nThe school finances and operates the community library through a \ncounty library setup. The veterans\' institute sponsored by the school \nserves two hundred veterans in seven centers located in near-by towns; \nits services extend to four counties. A staff of ten special instructors and \nfour regular staff members handles this program. The Agriculture Ad- \nvisory Committee of about twelve farmers, young and old, ser;ces to \nguide and set up goals for school and adult work in that area. \nThe faculty members are highly professional in their attitudes. The \nMesick School was one of the first in this part of the state to have 100 \nper cent membership in the state and national educational associations. \nSince teachers are allowed expenses for attending professional confer- \nences, of which there are many, the school is usually represented better \nthan most larger school systems. The school is a member of the College \nAgreement Group, whose graduates may enter college without regard to \nsubject sequence on presentation of a letter of recommendation by the \nprincipal. \nA staff of twenty-four teachers leads in planning the curriculum and \neducational program and is assisted by parents, teachers, and a lay edu- \ncational committee. The school curriculum has been revised to offer as \nmany subjects as possible to students who are not interested in college. \nCourses in auto mechanics, conservation, and personal problems are \npopular. Only one year of English is required of noncollege students. \nCourses in guide service, bait casting, and waitress work are contem- \nplated. \nMuch of the instruction is done on and through field trips, some local \n', '142 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nand some as far as two hundred miles away. Buses are in constant use, \ntaking students to observe objects under discussion or study. \nParent-teacher conferences are encouraged, and it is hoped that report \ncards can soon be replaced by this kind of personal contact. \nStudents are encouraged to work on community projects and to \nparticipate in school activities. A varsity " M "  is no longer a jealously \nguarded emblem of the athletic department but may be worn by any \nworthy student who earns 150 points through activity and service. The \nhonor-student award is no longer given to the one earning the highest \nmarks but is based on personality, scholastic record, participation in \nworth-while activities, citizenship, and contribution to the school and \ncommunity. \nThe student council obtains student reaction and suggestions. Follow- \nup and drop-out studies are made by vocational classes. \nResults. People disagree as to whether a community-centered school is \nsuperior, equal, or inferior to one of more traditional pattern. Mesick \nstudents seem to fit into community life or go on to college after gradua- \ntion with comparative ease. The expanded and liberalized curriculum \nhas apparently lessened the drop-out of boys who are not college- \nminded, since English and algebra, the subjects which seemed to give \nthem the most difficulty, have been removed from the required list. \nThe experience which students get through working in activities and \non community projects while in school equips them well to take part \nin community affairs after graduation. A definite effort is made to con- \nduct certain classes and units by using student-led discussion techniques \nsuch as the panel, the brief-discussion groups (known as Phillip 66--six \npersons discussing a specific question for six minutes), the symposium, \nand the observer-recorder. This experience helps to develop community \nleadership for granges, churches, farm bureaus, and other organizations. \nThe Community School Service Program, which has adult lay com- \nmittees on education, conservation, health, religion, recreation, home \nand family life, industry, and agriculture, is closely associated with the \nschool and stimulates community interest in school affairs. The work of \nthe school in tree planting and erosion control has helped to make the \nentire community conscious of the need for such work; thousands of \ntrees are planted each year. Many former students are now planting \ntrees on their own farms. \nThe students work in the school-operated cannery and urge their \nparents to try it. Many of its patrons are former students. \nA local ski area was constructed co-operatively last fall and winter by \nmeans of volunteer labor. It is complete with shelter, jumps, and tow \nmachines. \n', 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 143 \nThe habit of working co-operative!y, as learned in school, has prob- \nably helped make possible the building of a $20,000 community health- \ncenter by volunteer labor and public subscription. The community had \nbeen without a doctor for several years. A study revealed that about 60 \nper cent of the people were in need of medical attention. Through the \nCommunity School Service Program a health committee was organized \nto build a Community Health Center and get a doctor. The center has \nbeen completed and a doctor has been engaged. A County Health Unit \nprovides clinics for children and prenatal cases. Free glasses are provided \nby county service clubs for needy cases. Three free clinics are planned \nthis summer to give triple immunizations against tetanus, whooping \ncough, and diphtheria, as well as smallpox vaccinations for persons of \nany age. \nThe area abounds in natural opportunities for recreational activities \nsuch as boating, fishing, hunting, skiing, and hiking, of which the people \nare taking more and more advantage. The school "gym"  is constantly \nused by adults and young people alike for such activities as volleyball, \nbasketball, dances, and plays. Bowling teams of men and women engage \nin meets with near-by towns. Hardball and softball teams are organized \nby the community and the school\'s paid summer recreational leader. \nThe County Welfare, Federal Aid to Dependent Children, and other \nagencies provide funds for poverty-stricken families and dependent peo- \nple. The school furnishes many free meals to needy children; the others \nget a balanced meal for fifteen cents. Local groups collect clothing and \ndistribute it where it is needed. \nOperating this kind of school has its difficulties; excursions, outside \nservice projects, and a multitude of activities make for much more con- \nfusion, class interruption, and encroachment by one teacher upon other \nteachers\' classes. For the most part, the Mesick teachers are tolerant; \nanyone who feels that his class time is sacred would find it difficult to \nadiust to this program. \nThe change-over from the traditional school to the present method has \nbeen so gradual that most of those in the system or in the community \ndo not realize that they are doing anything unusual. They are often \npuzzled at the apparent curiosity and amazement of visitors. \nThe superintendent of the school is probably prejudiced; however, \nconsidering the progress made in community pride, co-operation, and \nimprovement during the past twenty years, it would seem to him that \nthe program is a success. He would be hesitant to claim that this program \nexcels any other, but he is convinced that it meets the needs of the com- \nmunity and that the curriculum has been adjusted to meet the needs of \nthe students as far as possible. The students are enthusiastic, energetic, \n', "144 PILOT PROGRAMS I N  RURAL EDUCATION \nand eager, since their work is meaningful and related to their present \nliving and their future goals. New students who enter the school from \nother systems adjust themselves quickly and are reluctant to leave when \noccasion demands. The students have a good understanding of commu- \nnity organization and have developed a marked degree of community \npride by mason of their participation in community-improvement \nprojects. \nThe program is hampered by a lack of space to include many of the \nservices which the staff would like to introduce. The student-activity \nprogram could be greatly expanded, although the staff now tries to pro- \nvide every student with an opportunity to develop leadership and organ- \nizational ability through the Future Farmers, Future Homemakers, \nScouts, glee clubs, band, camera club, science club, student council, \nconservation program, 4-H, and other groups. \nOutstanding Features of Mesick Consolidated School \nThere are many fine elements in the program of the Mesick school. \nPerhaps it would be better to say that there are many fine elements in \nthe life of the people in the Mesick community and that the school has \nmade a notable contribution to these community characteristics. The \nchallenging use of group technique~ for self-instruction, the creation of \na course of study that aims to help the noncollege pupil find his place in \nthe community, the use of varied communityservices as learning ex- \nperiences, the community institutes, and the plan of community organi- \nzation combine 'to make this a program that contributes to personal \ndevelopment and improvement in rural life. \nV \nTHE BARKER CENTRAL SCHOOL PROGRAM \nMILFORD PRATT \nSupervising Principal, Barker Central School \nBarker, New York \nThe Community. Barker Central School is located on the outskirts of \nthe village of Barker, in the western part of New York State. It  is in the \nNiagara fruit belt and is near the Niagara industrial frontier. The school \ndistrict, which covers the same territory as the Barker community, com- \nprises some fifty square miles. The villages of Somerset and Barker, in \nthe center of the district, are within one mile of each other. Barker is the \nmore important village as a trade andservice center. Two main highways \nand a branch line railroad serve the community. \nBarker is a typical rural New York State community. Its economic \n", "KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 145 \nlevel is neither outstandingly high nor outstandingly low. The size of the \nschool district and the size Of the school are only slightly above the aver- \nage for rural schools in New York State. Actualproperty valuation per \npupil is between $7,000 and $8,000; this is close to the average valuation \nper pupil for all the central schools of New York State. \nAbout 5,000 people live in the Barker community. Most of them are \nof old American stock, except for a sizeable number who are of Polish \nextraction. About half of the employed persons find work in factories \nand offices in Lockport, a city of 25,000, only eighteen miles distant from \nBarker. The remaining workers of the area are engaged in farming or in \nprocessing industries related to agriculture. The Barker community is \npredominantly rural in character. The land is flat, and the soil is of \ngood quality. Fruit farming is the main agricultural enterprise, though \nmany vegetable crops are also grownâ€¢ \nBarker Central School had its antecedent in the Barker High School, \na two-story, twelve-room brick structure. Typical of the early twenties, \nits offerings were limited to a college-preparatory program. The high \nschool was maintained by the village district and served academic pupils \nfrom several near-by townships. Pupils living outside the district at- \ntended one-room rural schools through the eighth grade and then went to \nthe high school on a tuition basis. Pupils traveled by foot, bicycle, horse \nand buggy, and by train. They had all types and degrees of preparation \nfor high school. Handicapped by slow methods of transportation, hours \nspent in farm work, low family income, lack of interest, and other condi- \ntions, they were often retarded in their progress and irregular in their \nattendance. Extra-class activities were few, and rural pupils were often \nexcluded~from these because of their lack of free time. \nCommunity services in this rural area consisted of those provided by \nseveral churches, a lodge or two, and a few other organizations. The \nGrange and the Farm and Home Bureaus played some part in com- \nmunity life. There were no organized recreational groups, and social \nparticipation was largely on a local neighborhood basis. \nThe Developing Program. The new school program has had a gradual \nâ€¢ â€¢ / \ngrowth, fostered by the school administration. Recogmtlon of the in- \nadequacy of the old program led to a desire for a program which would be \navailable to all pupils and adequate to their needs. As the vision of the \npersons concerned grew broader and clearer, new proc'edures were intro- \nducedâ€¢ \nThrough co-operative action by the school administration and the \nparents of pupils in the outlying areas, bus transportation was provided. \nThe addition of this service was approved by popular vote after facts \nobtained from many sources on the costs, efficiency, and safety of dis- \n", '146 P I L O T  P R O G R A M S  I N  R U R A L  E D U C A T I O N  , \ntrict-operated transportation and on the need to equalize educational \nopportunity had been presented to the public. \nThe following modifications were gradually made in the program: \nSubjects were added or dropped on the basis of their contribution to \nindividual and community needs. Health and guidance service, music, \nart, business subjects, vocational agriculture, and vocational homemak- \ning appeared in the curriculum. The holding power of the school became \ngreater. \nThe informal activity program helped pupils find themselves. Student \ngovernment and student projects increased the pupils\' interest in school. \nStudent leaders, discovered by their peers as well as by their teachers, . \ndeveloped through guided experiences and participation in group action. \nStudents learned to be self-reliant. \n" It is impossible to ascribe the development of any particular phase of \nthe program tp any one person or group. In some instances, groups of \ncitizens raised questions that stimulated action, viz. : "Why do we not \nhave more vocational training in an area where half of the people work in \nindustries?" Members of the Grange and others interested in agriculture \ntalked to board members and staff members about the school\'s responsi- \nbility for better farming. Spontaneous suggestions and ideas were fre- \nquently acted upon. It is probable that the activity program and student \ngovernment developed from the staff\'s efforts to keep abreast of desir- \nable educational trends. Informal ~tiscussions, joint meetings, division of \nresponsibility , and joint action often preceded change. The confidence \nof all the people connected with the school helped to keep the program \nexpanding. Each success gave rise to additional ideas. \nFortunately, conditions were\' favorable to the personal and profes- \nsional growth of members of the board of education and, in turn, of staff \nmembers. Able people were at liberty to think, to plan, and to secure co- \noperative action for putting their plans into operation. \nWhen the school began to outgrow its physical facilities, centralization \nseemed to be the best means of serving the people. This involved difficult \nproblems. The village had to give up its exclusive control of the school, \nand the larger area had to assume considerable financial burdens. Cen- \ntralization did not come easily. Times were poor; it was the period of the \ngreat depression. Political boundaries caused trouble. No other central \nschools existed in the area. But the developing program had ignited a \nspark that could not be extinguished. \nCentralization resulted in a different elementary-school program. Indi- \nvidual differences were more fully recognized and work was adapted to \neach child\'s abilities. Kindergarten facilities were added. A~viation, li- \nbrary service, intramural athletics, and dramatics became a part of the \n', "K U L L M A N  A N D  B U T T E R W O R T H  147 \ndaily program. A trade school was added at the high-school level to meet \nthe needs of pupils who would be employed in industry. The present trade \nschool permits pupils to acquire p~actical knowledge in farm machinery, \nauto mechanics, machine shop, drafting, welding, and aviation mechan- \nics. An airport approved by the Civil Aeronautics Authority is a part of \nthe school facilities. Crop dusting by aircraft is a service feature of the \nschool. \nIt was believed that the results of improved agricultural practices \ncould be shown most concretely and effectively by means of practical \ndemonstration. Accordingly, 170 acres of somewhat run-downfarmland \nimmediately adjoining the scho61 campus were rented and later pur- \nchased. Old fence balks were removed, proper drainage applied, and the \nland put under cultivation as a meaningful example of good practices for \nthe community. These improvements were made only as careful book- \nkeeping procedures showed that the expenditures paid for themselves. \nAdditions have gradually been made: a poultry house, a greenhouse, a \nbeef herd, and a desirable program of crop rotation. In addition to cattle, \nhogs, and poultry, the farm produces grains, vegetables, and Niagara \nCounty fruits. These products supply a large share of the needs of a year- \nround cafeteria. The surplus is marketed. The home-economics and \ncafeteria departments co-operate in preserving ai~d using the farm \nproducts. Classes in agriculture use the farm as a laboratory and demon- \nstration center. \nAn effort has been made to gear the services of the school to the needs \noi' the entire community in order that the community may profit both \ndirectly and indirectly. School shops invented and perfected dusting \napparatus that made possible a local crop-dusting organization that now \noperates six dusting planes from the school airport to serve the farmers of \nNiagara and Orleans counties. Experimentation with crops on the farm \nhas helped to bring in broccoli as a new quick-freezing crop, to establish \ndusting control for tomatoes, to demonstrate the economy of green- \nhouses, and to encourage better beef and poultry raising. Out-of-school \nfarm youth come to the school for additional agricultural courses; farm \nmachinery clinics are regularly scheduled. These represent only a sam- \npling of the numerous Services that the school renders to the community. \nIn the days of the National Youth Administration, a co-operative \ndormitory was operated in conjunction with the school program. In re- \nsponse to continued requests, the school took this over; it now houses \nnonresident pupils. Within the past ten years, students have attended \nBarker Central School from every county in New York State, and \nscores of requests have come from other states. Admitted to the dormi- \ntory program are young people who are earnestly seeking this type of \n", "148 PILOT PROGRAMS IN  RURAL EDUCATION \neducation. They bring new interests and ideals to a small community and \na small school that might otherwise tend toward inbreeding. \nWith the passage of time, preparation of students for community life \nhas improved. Thr(~ugh the activity program pupils are helpedto develop \ntheir capacities for social competence as future citizens. The school pro- \ngram now includes clubs of all descriptions--music, sports, hobbies, sub- \nject matter, special interests. The two-day fair, sponsored jointly by \nschool and community, the music festivals, and the open-house programs \ngive pupils opportunities to try out their organizational, executive, and \nperformance abilities. \nThe fair began as a school exhibit in the gymnasium. It  was highly \nsuccessful. Suggestions for the following year came to the committee \nfrom many sources.Each succeeding year brought innovations and addi- \ntional ideas until, at present, the entire first floor of the high school and \nfive acres of the school grounds are needed to present the three thousand \nindividual exhibits. The fair is headed by a pupil-faculty committee. A \nco-operating community advisory committee, comprising representatives \nof local government and of grange and service organizations, aids the \nplanners to keep in tune with the community. Nearly everybody in the \ncommunity takes part in one way or another. Father is interested in the \nlivestock Junior is exhibiting, and Mother is proud of her daughter's \nbaked goods. Even the sideshows and midway give opportunity for the \nexpression of creative talent and leadership ability. The fair is a challeng- \ning and stimulating project. Changes in home and community living have \nresulted from the activities involved in putting it on. \nThe school has also attempted to help adtflts directly. It  sponsors an \nadult-education program of both formal and informal' classes which is \nconcerned with the vocational, civic, recreational, and cultural interests \nof adults. This program continues throughout the summer as well as \nduring the winter months. \nThe Barker Central School, like other central schools in New York \nState, has become the hub of many of the various aspects of life in its \nsmall community. Two evenings each week, people of the community \nmay come to the high-school auditorium for a moving-picture program \nwhich otherwise would not be available. The Lion's Service Club and the \nHome Bureau meet in the school. A county choral group and various \nother cultural organizations of pupils and adults constantly use its facili- \nties. During the summer months, the high-school band presents concerts \nin small hamlets throughout the area. In these and other ways the com- \nmunity serves the school, and the school, in turn, serves the community. \nThe development of this school has not been one-sided. The school \ncould not progress without community support. Generous financial sup- \n", 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH " 149 \nport has made its facilities possible. Scholarships have provided incen- \ntives to Worthy boys and girls. ,~ctive co-operation has been the corner- \nstone of growth. \nThe people of Barker are proud of their program. They know that it \ncan be better. They are determined to make it so. \nOutstanding Features of Barker Central School \nAs one reads the Barker report, it becomes clear that the community\'s \nco-operation and open-mindedness and the staff\'s freedom to grow and \nexperiment did not come about by chance. All along the line of growth \nthere seems to have been the conviction that an informed community is \nlikely to be a co-operative community. The responsible school authori- \nties apparently did not believe in a public-relations program based on \nschool-slanted propaganda. Evidently the school associated itself with \ncommunity life and became a part of the total community. Further, it is \napparent that members of the staff had the intelligence and the vision to \nrecognize sound suggestions and to put them to work. \nThe vital features of the Barker program are : recognition of the role of \nthe school in a rural community, co-operative planning and action which \nled to strength through consolidation, an enriched program at all levels, \nthe relating of school opportunities to community opportunities, the use \nof the building as a community center, dnd provision of services to im- \nprove the living of ail the people in the community. While focusing atten- \ntion on a better community, the people responsible for this program did \nnot lose sight of the value of activities for the immediate personal de- \nvelopment of the pupils, and for their growth in social responsibility. \nVI \nA\'RURAL HIGH SCHOOL CHARTS COMMUNITY GROWTH \nWI~T.IAM J. NIGG \nSuperintendent, Thomson Township Public Schools \nEsko, Minnesota \nSome Background. The area served by the Thomson Township Schools \napproximates that of the township, which is located in Carlton County, \nMinnesota. This heavily populated area is part of a cut-over region that  \nwas once covered with virgin stands of Norway and White pine The \nwoodsman\'s greed and the disastrous Cloquet forest fire of October 12, \n1918, practically eliminated the merchantable timber, leaving only \nstumps, rocks, and second growth of birch and aspen. This devastating \n\'fire swept out of the northwest, destroying the entire city of Cloquet \nand most of the farm homes of Thomson Township. At that \'time the \n', '150 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nr \npopulation of about 1,700 people was, with the exception of a few Swedish \nfamilies, largely of Finnish nationality Almost all of them had come \ndirectly to this area to log off the timber or,farm the stone- and stump- \ncovered lands so much like their native Finland. These hard-working \npioneer families turned to dairying as their means of livelihood. Their \nfarms ranged from twenty to one hundred and sixty acres. The original \nhomestead usually consisted of a small house, bulging with children, a \nlarge barn, and a small "sauna" or Finnish bathhouse. The cleared mead- \nows had typical log haysheds; the early dairy herds were fed primarily on \nhay and grass. Even in those days, Cloquet, five miles away, and Duluth, \nabout twelve miles distant, were the markets for the people of Thomson \nTownship. Many young Finnish lads trudged those miles laden with \nbutter or Finnish cheese for market. \nIn the forest fire of 1918, the rural schools of the area, consisting of four \none-room schools, three two-room schools, and one three-room school \nwere almost entirely wiped out. After the first shock of the disaster had \nabated, people came back to rebuild their barns and homes. In the spring \nof 1919, the residents voted to merge the school districts into an inde- \npendent school district that would operate a consolidated school, as \ndefined by the laws of the state of Minnesota. By means of a bond issue, \nthey constructed an eight-room elementary school in the northern area \nand a high-school building two miles to the south. A home for teachers \nwas provided near each school. \nIn August, 1919, Mr. A. L. Winterquist, w.ho\'had returned from educa- \ntional work with the American Expeditionary Forces in France, was \nemployed as superintendent of schools. The educational system of the \ncommunity is a lasting monument to the success of his efforts. During \nthe twenty-six years that he served, his leadership both in school and \nin the community molded the pattern of development. His first iob \nwas to supervise the construction of the school buildings and to organ- \nize and administer the educational program of this new consolidated \nschool district. There was not one economic, social, or service club to \nassist in this work. The newly completed high school soon became the \ncenter of all community activities. The school building with its home- \neconomics room, classrooms, and gymnasium was open at all times for \ncommunity activities such as Sunday school, community plays, public \nforums, recreational activities, and organizational meetings. The super- \nintendent\'s wife organized the first high-school band in Carlton County, \nwhich became important in local social life. \nImproving Agriculture. Since the community\'s economic interest was \nlargely agricultural, one of the first proiects was the formation of the \nArrowhead Co-operative Creamery. The school furnished the leadership \n', "K U L L M A N  AND B U T T E R W O R T H  151 \nfor this movement and Mr. Winterquist served for nine years as the \nsecretary of the Co-operative board. The growth of this co-operative \nventure has contributed greatly to the building of a better community \nand to the development of the school's educational program. The influ- \nence of the creamery has extended over a large area; it has drawn on \nother regions for its milk and has set the pattern for modern plants in \nother parts of northern Minnesota. \nAs marketing regulations became more rigid, educational plans had to \nbe improved, milkhouses built, wells drilled, and modern methods of \nmilking introduced. An educational field man employed by the creamery \nworked in co-operation with the school in a broad program to improve \nthe quality and quantity of the milk. The school geared its agricultural \nclassroom program to this problem; its curriculum became primarily \nconcerned with dairying pl:oblems. The youngsters proved to be the best \nteachers and gradually modified the practices of their tradition-bound \nparents. Recognizing the importance of agricultural education, Mr. \nWinterquist taught academic agriculture for several years; in 1929 the \nboard of education authorized the introduction of a Smith-Hughes agri- \ncultural department with a full-time agriculture instructor. This depart- \nment gave new direction to farming and rural living in the township. \nThe department assumed direction of the 4-H Club activities and also \norganized the first chapter of Future Farmers of America in the state of \nMinnesota. Adult farmers were organized into a unit known as the Farm- \ner's Club, which conducted both classes and social events. It became the \nleading community organization. \nThis club, with the co-operation of the schools, puts on a community \nfair on the high-school grounds each year in August. This display of the \nachievements of the community in education and farming is a big event \nfor the local people; it appears to be the heart of the school-community \nprogram. The annual school exhibit, the 4-H exhibit, displays of farm \ncrops and livestock, entertainment features, and a sports program fill two \ndays. While exhibits of a commercial nature are encouraged, no carnival \ninfluence is permitted. The program is truly a community-betterment \nproject. Since this fair precedes the county fair by a week, it has proven \nto be a great encouragement to the young people of the community. This \nis evidenced by the fact that many fine dairy herds, predominantly \nGuernsey and Holstein, had their beginnings in the pureblood stock ex- \nhibited at the local show. Blue-ribbon winners are automatically entitled \nto enter the county fair, and the club encourages them to do so by paying \nfor the transportation of their stock. Thus, residents are encou'raged to \nparticipate in life beyond the limits of the local community. Several of \nthe local youngsters have also won trips to the annual state fair. \n", '152 PILOT "PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nAs a climax to the agricultural activities of the year, a pre-Thanksgiv- \ning friendship banquet for those who have aided in making the commu- \nnity fair a success is jointly sponsored by  the school and the Farmers\' \nClub. Invitations are issued to three or four hundred local people and \nbusinessmen from Duluth, Cloquet, and Carlton. \nCredit should also be given to the activity of the local farm youth. In \nthis high school of two hundred students, fewer than ten live in what \nmight be called nonrural homes. Not all the farm boys have stayed on \nthe farm, but a great number of them have resettled here after trying \nurban life for a few years. Along with those that have taken over the \nhome farm, they form a specially trained group of young people who will \nmake better farmers. - \nThe farm-practice program of the Future Farmers of America is de- \nsigned to train boys to become better farmers. The experience that these \nboys get on their own farms, plus their participation in the district and \nstate activities of the organization, has provided a kind of in-service \ntraining for parents in the newer things in agriculture. During the past \nyear, the group received a gold-medal award for outstanding service to \nthe community. Among their accomplishments, they provided the fol- \nlowing services to farmers: (a) loaning cattle clippers to encourage \nclipping of cows for cleaner milk, (b) treating grain seed for production \nof better crops, at a minimum fee which covers the cost of the chemicals \nused, (c) a fertilizer project for the low-costrental of a mineral fertilizer \nspreader, (d) a service to provide periodic checking of milk production \nfor local dairymen, plus a regular check upon the home herds, (e) a free \nlandscaping and home-beautification advisory service in a limited num- \nber of cases where requested, (f) full co-operation in the work of the com- \nmunity fair and friendship banquet, and (g) the provision of seedlings for \nfarm-lot reforestation work. Regular activities include judging of poultry, \nlivestock, dairy products, and grains; practice in parliamentary procedure \nand public speaking; projects in wildlife and conservation, and summer \ncamping experiences. \nThe boys of the Future Farmers of America are consistent winners in \nagricultural contests conducted by local industries interested in agricul- \nture. Recently, a bound yearbook was published honoring the twentieth \nanniversary of the chapter\'s foundation. One could best summarize the \ncontribution of this organization by saying that the F.F.A. chapter his- \ntory indicates that the imp?oved farm practices which they have insti- \ntuted have resulted in higher standards of living in the community and \nare an inspiration to all. \nRecognizing the Needs of Girls. Though up to this point we have\' dealt \nchiefly with the education of rural young men, it must not be inferred \n', 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 153 \nthat the young women of the community are neglected. Home-economics \neducation is as old a part of the local curriculum as education in agricul- \nture and is considered to be of equal importance. Young women in a rural \ncommunity need to learn practical homemaking skills quite as much as \nboys need agricultural skills and shop experiences. Beginning with the \nseventh grade, girls receive education in cooking, sewing, home furnish- / \ning, child care, family life, nutrition, and personality development. Each \ngirl is required to take three years of preliminary household sciences and \narts, and most of them elect to take the two advanced courses;many \nhave asked for a sixth year of study in this field. \nThe girls make a special contribut.ion to the life of the school. All but \na few of the school functions require the assistance of the home-eco- \nnomics group. The girls have not confined themselves to class work but \nhave assisted in preparing, making decorations for, and serving the \nfriendship banquet. \nThe course for girls has expanded far beyond cooking and sewing. \nThis year the program of child care included a unit on baby-sitting. Some \ngirls volunteered to operate a nursei-y for small children while their \nmothers attended the Parent-Teacher\'s meetings; others would "sit" \nwithout charge for the mothers whose children were at home in bed. An \nextensive program of refurbishing old equipment and furniture, and mak- \ning draperies and curtains for the department\'s dining room and bedroom \nalso gave a practical slant to classroom instruction. \nImproving the School Plant. Since its construction, the high school has \nbeen expanded to meet the demands of the times. A larger gymnasium \nwas added, which now serves as the home for physical-fitness classes for \nmen and women, for intramural athletics for boys and girls, for school \nplays, and for the activities of the high-school and community athletic \nteams. Addition of a farm and auto shop has made possible the expansion \nof the traditional shop program; it now serves to prepare the boys to do \nthe mechanical jobs that are required on their home farms. Here they can \nlearn electric and arc welding, forge work, sheet metal work, and the \noverhauling of farm machinery and tractors. During the war, a further \naddition providedfor a community cannery to aid the government food- \nconservation plan. The peak war-year production amounted to over 124,- \n000 pints of preserved foods. The cannery building has also been used for \nclasses in home economics and as a school cafeteria serving a daily meal to \nan average of over 175 students. The food program has been praised for \nits influence in the improvement of school lunches and family diets. Its \nworth is attested by its contribution to the health and social education \nof the students. \nAdult Education. Community adult education is likewise a part of this \n', '154 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nschool system. In the early days of this community, evening citizenship \nclasses greatly helped Americanization. More recently, evening classes for \nfarmers have been very popular. Classes for veterans.have also been particu- \nlarlysuccessful; these young men have shown great promise and have bene- \nfited greatly from postgraduate work in agriculture and shop. Both men and \nwomen have enrolled in evening woodworking classes during the past two \nyears. Community athletic activities serve the social needs of a rural peo- \nple; the school facilities provide for year-round participation in basket- \nball, volleyball, kittenball, baseball, swimming, and skating. The school \ndistrict operates a summer recreational program in co-operation with \nthe township government. If the rural community is made attractive \nenough socially, economically, and aesthetically, more of the able youth \nwill resist the artificial lure of city life. \nEducational Guidance of Youth. Thomson Township High School is \nfully accredited. It  is interested in the development of every individual \nin the entire school population. Too many schools are geared only to a \ncollege-preparatory or academic kind of education. However, it is equally \nfallacious to believe that all pupils should be educated for life in their \nlocal community. Curricular offerings at Thomson are divided into four \nareas: college preparatory, agricultural or home training, commercial, \nand general. The school maintains five special departments: home eco- \nnomics, industrial training, agriculture, commercial, and music, each \nunder specially trained instructors. Upon reaching the tenth year, a \npupil selects his course, aided by counselors who examine his ability rat- \n"ings, personality, past achievement, and home background. Though he \nis allowed some choice of electives, by graduation he has received \nthorough preparation in a definite area. The general course offers educa- \ntional opportunities for those who seem to lack ability or interests in \nspecific areas. \nCocurricular Activities. The school\'s holding power would suffer great- \nly if it failed to provide activities of interest to all, activities that serve as \nemotional outlets for the excess steam that youth generates. Thomson \noffers such activities as basketball, football, baseball, track, band, mixed \nchorus, girls\' glee dub, girls\' athletic associations, speech, dramatics, \nnewspaper, annual, photography club, parties, banquets, and picnics, \nall of which help develop a rounded individual and make for a good \nschool spirit. \nSchools in rural America have an even greater responsibility for in- \nformal pupil activities than do urban schools. Rural schools must be \ncommunity centers, supplying many educational, social, and recreational \nadvantages otherwise missing from their pupils\' environment. The local \nschool board has long felt that it must encourage pupils to participate in \ntl~ese activities. During the past year local school buses traveled over \n', 'KULLMAN ~ AND BUTTERWORTH 155 \n12,000 miles in taking children to and f rom school functions and on \nexcursions and field trips of an educational nature. Transpor ta t ion  is pro- \nvided for evening practices in athletics, dramatics,  girls\' recreational \nactivities, school parties, band practices and appearances, and other \nprograms. School excursions allow classes to visit near-by industries and \npoints of interest;  there is an annual two-day  trip to St. Paul and Min- \nneapolis. I t  is obvious tha t  this school \'s program is not  restricted to the \n3-R\'s. \nWhy  and How. The "why and how"  of the progress achieved by  the \nThomson Township schools are possibly as impor tant  to the reader as \nthe fact tha t  progress was achieved. The following Statement by  Mr. \nWinterquist,  superintendent of the school district f rom its organization \nin 1919 until his ret irement in 1945, expresses briefly what  he considers \nthe chief reasons for the success of this educational program:  \nThe philosophy of the rural leadership pursued in this district was not some- \nthing new and spectacular. I t  can be duplicated elsewhere by leaders who are \nwilling to work. In my opinion the basic factors in our successful rural-school \nprogram are these: \nA Long-Term Educational Program. My long-term program and educational \nobjective was and still is to create and maintain in the rural community a high \nstandard of living and learning. One way in which this can be accomplished is in \nand through the rural consolidated school, when the requisite dynamics and \nleadership are discovered and directed. All of the activities of this community \nin education, co-operative organizations, Farmer\'s Club and night classes, \n4-It Clubs, F.F.A. community plays, and programs have been directed toward \nthis long-term objective. This goal gives dignity and greatness to the scope of \nthe rural-school program. \nKnowledge of the Character and Beliefs of the Patrons and Taxpayers. I t  is \nnecessary that the school leaders know the educational, political, economic, and \nreligious backgrounds and interests of their people. What the patrons think and \nbelieve along those lines will largely determine their support of or opposition \nto the program of the schools. Their thoughts and beliefs will also determine \nthe nature of the initial program of action the rural leader must undertake to \nsecure support for his program. I have capitalized on the love the Finnish people \nhave for their home and neighborhood, on their belief in education, and, in \nparticular, on their desire that their children should have a better education \nthan they themselves had had. The patrons and taxpayers have given fine sup- \nport to the entire education-d program in this district. The people are the chief \nfactor in the success of any school program. \nAcquiring the Confidence and Trust of the People. In order to gain the confidence \nof the people, the superintendent of a rural consolidated school must know \nfarming and farm life. Since I was born on a farm, grew up on a farm, and had \nspent most of my life with rural people, I found it a pleasure to visit every farm \nhome in the district, not to talk about school problems but about farming, chil- \ndren, community problems, personal problems, and, if necessary, ,milk a cow \n', '156 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \nor two. Thus, I became a neighbor who loves his neighbor and is vitally inter- \nested in the happiness of all neighbors. It  was not long before I was invited to \nspeak in their churches and at co-operative programs, was elected to the director- \nship of local organizations, and was asked to represent the community, the town- \nship, and the schools on occasions when the community needed representation. \nBecause the people had confidence and trust, it was natural for them to give \nwhole-hearted support to the entire school program. Thus, the success of the \nprogram became the concern of the people and not of the superintendent alone. \nThe children and the grandchildren of the people with whom I first worked \nare now similarly determined to carry on the program of their fathers, in order \nthat the standard of living and the level of intelligence of this community shall \nbe the finest of which they are capable. \nThe Philosophy at Work. I t  was the writer\'s pleasure to work with Mr. \nWinterquist for two years before his retirement. Yet to tell just how he \nworked this "modern miracle" is a difficult task. Each step was always \nmeasured in the light of what it could do to make bet ter  individuals and \nto provide them a bet ter  way of life. \nTWO of the later developments, the communi ty  cannery and the com- \nmuni ty  co-operative locker plant, were in process during the writer\'s \nobservation. The procedures in each case were somewhat similar. For  \nmany years, Mr. Winterquist had been interested in improving on the \nmeat  and potato diet of the Finnish people. He strove constantly to teach \nthem through agriculture, home economics, the hot-lunch program, and \nespecially the 4-H Club gardening projects, to include a variety of foods. \nThe shortage of food during World War I I  gave him an excellent op- \npor tuni ty  to continue this teaching. As often before, he used the school \nas both his springboard and his sounding board:  His first step was to get \nsome club member on the school board interested in the idea of a locker \nplant. The idea was then allowed to permeate the thinking of the group \nuntil all the members became so interested tha t  the idea seemed to be \ntheir own. Soon the members requested that  something be done. The \nidea had thus lost its identi ty and was no longer "Winterquist \'s  new \nidea," but  had become "our  locker plant ."  \nMr. Winterquist  then used the school to further the plan. A public \nmeeting in the school gymnasium, announced to all parents by school- \nbus bulletins, was addressed by  an outside speaker. This gathering showed \nsufficient interest in the plan to warrant  concrete action; a general steer: \ning committee was selected, with Mr. Winterquist  as chairman. This \ncommittee then studied the problem thoroughly and reported at a later \nmeeting. Inspired by its leader\'s boundless energy, the group carried \nmuch of the promotional work; when the decisiye vote was taken, the \nproposal carried. The plans were implemented by the combined efforts \nof the committee, Mr. Winterquist, and an interested faculty member \n', "KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 157 \ntrained in that area. Mr. Winterquist capitalized on the interest of the \nFinns in co-operatives and on their willingness to work for community \nwelfare. His policy of using local people in all phases of the work made \nthe project a co-operative success. Even the pupils were not forgotten. \nRealizing that the continued success of the program depended on the \nsupport of future citizens, Mr. Winterquist encouraged classes in the \nschool to study the proposal, discuss its merits, and follow its growth with \ninterest. \nThe actual establishment of the community cannery was more diffi- \ncult. The school was already overcrowded; no space could be rented. \nFinally Mr. Winterquist located a temporarily unused cheese storage \nspace in the co-operative creamery and went to work. Once a group be- \ncame vitally interested in the project, the job was merely to direct the \nenergies of many people to get the place cleared, the equipment in place, \nand the staff engaged to handle the work. His knowledge of the people, \ntheir capabilities, their interests, and their leadership made the plan \nwork. Not content with an inadequate building, he again sdggested that \na new building be built by the school board, if the people wished it. \nPopular demand called for a building; the vote carried, and a modern \n$25,000 cannery was built. \nAn Evaluation of the Program. To evaluate a school's program is a \nmost difficult task. Success cannot be measured solely by the success of \nthe graduates, their passing scores on achievement tests, or their love for \ntheir alma mater. To the writer, the final test is whether the school has \nbeen able to make better citizens in its own community. No school pro- \ngram can succeed in this objective unless i t  is a community force for \nbetter living and actually makes the community a better place in which \nto live. I t  would seem that a magnificent job has been done by the school \nhere in Thomson Township. There was generated a driving force and \ncommunity pride that enabled people to lift themselves to a higher cul- \nâ€¢ tural, economic, and social level. \nOutstanding Features of Thomson Township Schools \nThe contribution that an individual can make to the lives of others, \nprovided he understands and likes the people, has faith in the goal he \nhas set, and is willing to give of himself through untiring effort, stands \nforth like a beacon in the foregoing program. The personality of the \nleader and his skill in working with people are the key features. Here is a \nsituation in which the school found itself by losing itself in the life of the \ncommunity. The community is the important entity; the school is a \nmeans to the end of personal development and improved living. \nOther significant elements appear to be consolidation, provision for \n", "158 PILOT PROGRAMS IN  RURAL EDUCATION \nthe housing of teachers, the use of school buildings for community pur- \nposes, co-operation of all persons in the community in tackling projects, \na school program adapted to local needs, a transportation policy that \nfacilitates the total school program, and the promotion of school per- \nsonnel from within the ranks. Basic to the progress achieved is the super- \nintendent's practice of measuring each suggested course of action in the \nlight of the established objectives, developing understanding on the part \nof key individuals before presenting a plan to the group, and going no \nfaster than the group is ready to move. \nVII \nTHE LITTLE RIVER SCHOOL \nJ. L. MOFFITT \nTeacher of Agriculture \nBahama, North Carolina \nThe County. Durham County, one of the smallest counties of North \nCarolina, is situated in the north central part of the state. I t  lies wholly \nwithin the Piedmont Plateau province. Its area is about 291 square miles. \nThe county is well settled and contains several churches and schools. \nRural mail routes reach practically every rural dwelling. The nonfarm \nrural population, both white and Negro, is about 7,000. The total rural \npopulation is nearly 16,700. Farm statistics reveal that there are 780 \nwhite owners, 104 Negro owners, 1,078 white operators, 393 Negro \noperators, 619 white tenants, and 275 Negro tenants. The farm acreage \ntotals 33,252 acres. \nThough crop production in the county is diversified to some degree, \ntobacco is the chief money crop. Efforts toward further diversification \nare increasing food and field-crop yields. There is a shortage in livestock \nproduction. \nThe School District. The Little River School District is situated in the \nnorthern end of the county. I t  runs north from the Eno River for ap- \nproximately ten miles. The city of Durham is ten miles to the south on \nU.S. Highway 501. \nThe present school building was erected in 1935. Four school districts \nconsolidated to form the only rural high school in the area. SeVen \nn~otor buses travel 250 miles daily to transport six hundred pupils to \nschool. Twenty-one teachers are employed, including a vocational home- \neconomics instructor (George-Dean) and a vocational agriculture teacher \n(Smith-Hughes). \nAvailable related services include: public health, public welfare, \ndairy council, forest, farm crop and seed loan, soil conservation, and the \nAgricultural Extension Services. Other services comprise: six churches, \n", 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 159 \nthree community centers, a post office, a freight station, and veterans\' \ngroups. \nThe Development of the Family-Life Program. Recognizing that the \nschool should reflect the pertinent living problems of the people, the \nvocational teachers, Mrs. M. C. Moffitt and J. L. Moffitt, started a \nprogram in 1937 which included all family members. \nCommunity needs were first uncovered by a survey that showed the \nneed for: farm and home ownership and improvement, improved health \nand sanitation; recreational centers and equipment; co-operative activi- \nties on the part of groups and of the community as a whole; and better \nworking relations between school and community. On the basis of these \nneeds, the communities were organized into family-life units comprising \nyoung and old. Each unit chose its officers and formulated objectives. \nIn 1938-39 the State Department of Education selected this school as \none of five to carry on experimental projects with families. Not being satis- \nfield with the methods used in working with families, the homemaking \nteacher devoted the next year to studying how to improve these co- \noperative projects and how the conference method could be made more \neffective. During the summer of 1941 the principal and the home-eco- \nnomics and agriculture teachers accepted fellowships in a family-life \nworkshop. This workshop broadened their knowledge of the ways in \nwhich the church, home, and school could all work together for a better \nrural community. \nFamily-life education is the core of the Little River school program. \nFrom the first grade on, activities concerned with family life comprise the \nmajor part of the school experiences. Problems studied by both second- \nary-school pupils and adults include the needs recognized in the com- \nmunity survey. \nIn 1941-42 community groups went into action. The slogan became, \n"A Community Learning, Working, Serving, Playing, and Worshiping." \nSome of the activities already in operation are: \n1. The community fair, managed by members of the community; the school \npresents a special chapel program and recreational activities. \n2. Community day, for the purpose of improving family and community \nrelations. \n3. The annual radio program, to inform the public about the local school and \ncommunity program. \n4. The adult play, to increase parents\' feeling of participation in the school and \nto develop a closer working relation between the school and the community; \nit also is a means of developing talent and providing recreation. \n5. The farm and home clinic devoted to repairing farm tools and machinery, \nrenovating furniture, woodworking, and other useful activities; persons in \nthe community who have skill in various trades are used as assistants. \n', '160 PILOT PROGRAMS IN RURAL EDUCATION \n6. Banquets for parents and pupils. \n7. Improvement of community, school, and church. \n8. Family and community Christmas trees. \n9. Play centers--a field for baseball and other sports; a community house that \ncost $1,850 and which is free of indebtedness; a beautiful log recreation build- \ning constructed by members of the organization; and other recreation centers \nin the process of construction-. \nThe Results. These proieets are beginning to show desirable results. \nBefore this program was in operation, the community stores and the \nwarehouses in the city of Durham attracted young people and adults \nduring their leisure time. Now, young people stay in the community on \nSaturday evenings for recreation. To date, records show that 175 to 225 \nadults and children participate in organized play during Saturday eve- \nnings. Canteens are provided on the playgrounds. Wholesome activities \nhave developed as leisure time has been wisely spent. \nIn the Bahama organization, there are a number of older men and \nwomen. For this group, a Use-Your-Hand Club has been organized which \nenlists the services of the art and special teachers in the county. Under \nthe guidance of these leaders a number of the members have learned to \nmake articles from pine needles, pine burrs, straw, and willow branches. \nThey engage in activities such as crocheting, knitting, repairing house- \nhold articles, sewing, and patching. They make many useful articles for \nhome use and for sale. \nIn addition to this art program, a number of other activities have been \nintroduced into the community. Baseball came first. Some of the newer \nactivities are: volleyball, headball, netball, ring games, community \nsuppers and games, square dancing, horseshoe, and bingo parties. \nThe community program has developed competent leadership. Five \nformer students, who were members of the organization, are making \nexcellent records as leaders in near-by colleges. Before this program went \ninto operation it was hard to find persons who would take part in or di- \nrect community activities. Today many individuals ask to be given an \nopportunity to participate in the program. \nDuring the past fifteen years the radio programs alone have made it \npossible for 162 different individuals to participate. Several have ap- \npeared as many as three times. The agriculture teacher was able to send \na group to a radio station several miles away to present a program with- \nout his assistance--a program which was rated as good by radio officials. \nThe relations between the component communities have improved as \na result of co-operative activities. At the beginning of this program, the \ncommunities were somewhat isolated. Very little interaction existed be- \n', 'KULLMAN AND BUTTERWORTH 161 \ntween their respective members, and when they did gather, there was \nusually some sort of disturbance. Today this situation no longer exists. \nNo less important among the results of this program is the continuous \nadvance of the projects for home, farm, and crop improvement. \nWhich Way Now? This is just the beginning of the program as those \nin charge would like it to be. They are working toward a program de- \nveloped by the people and designed for useful and effective learning on \nthe part of children and adults; one which will help improve the quality \nof living in the community as well as provide opportunities for the de- \nvelopment of civic responsibilities. They are concerned with democratic \nparticipation on the part of all family members for the welfare of all con- \ncerned. They envisage a program that will continue to stimulate home \nand community improvement and contribute toward raising the stand- \nards of living, physically, economically, morally, and ethically. Finally, \nthey hope to have a happy people who ahvays want to do more. \nOutstanding Features of the Little River School \nThis program is another illustration of ways in which people can help \nthemselves if there are some persons present who have ideas and the \nability to release the creative energy in other people. The school is the \ncenter of community life. Anyone who has lived in a rural district in \nwhich there were several distinct neighborhoods will readily appreciate \nthe contribution to group effort that this school and its people have \nmade. The most unique feature of this program is the family-life units. \nThese are family study groups, comparable to the child study groups \nthat have proved so effective. \nBAsic F.~CTORS IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF RURAL SCHOOLS \nThe foregoing stories of the conception and growth of specific school \nprograms, together with other descriptions that are available in current \nliterature, serve as sources of stimulation and encouragement to those of \nus engaged in school work in rural areas. The problems, needs, issues, and \ntechniques that have been described here give us a feeling of mutuality \nand singleness of purpose. These problems are seldom unique; they are \nwidespread and affect many of us. But whether common or unique, the \nproblems, vital influences, and successful methods of solution herein de- \ntailed should have meaning and value to those engaged in rural education \nin any part of our country. \nIdentifying the Problems of Rural Education \nThe early problems and handicaps of the schools described in these \nreports were alike in many respects. Among the initial conditions fre- \n', "162' PILOT PROGRAMS I N  RURAL EDUCATION \nquently present were inadequate transportation, elementary curriculums \nlimited to the 3 R's, high-school programs which were primarily college \npreparatory, teaching methods consisting essentially of textbook learn- \ning and recitations, poor attendance, lack of community support, \nmeager extra-class activities, schools divorced from the community, un- \nsatisfied adult needs, small and inefficient districts, poor economic con- \nditions, untapped local resources, and communities unattractive to their, \nyoung people. \nAlthough these schools are located in widely separated and differing \ncommunities, several common elements seem to characterize their pro- \ngrams. One basic factor stands out clearly in all the descriptions: in each \ncase, real needs or problems were recognized and adequate leadership \nwas forthcoming. No improvement would have taken place unless this \nwere so. The recognition of the need seems to have provided the necessary \nstimulus, but the will to serve the community better seems also to have \nbeen a prime factor in effecting the indicated changes. Another obvious \ngenerality may be derived: The means or methods employed in establish- \ning and maintaining the new programs were suited to the particular local \nconditions. This suggests, as a corollary, that indiscriminate adoption of \none school system's program by another may not result in the attainment \nof desired ends. A method successfully used in one situation will not \nnecessarily give like results in a comparable situation; administrators \ndiffer in leadership ability, and staffs are not equally competent. The \nmost important value accrues when local people plan together. \nThe Role of Leadership in Educational Progress \nAs one reads these stories of developing school programs, he gradually \nbecomes aware of certain elements that are of critical importance. The \nforemost of these is a special type of leadership. Primarily, the leaders \nhave the quality of being able to see What others do not see. Theirs is a \nnew horizon, and the paths leading toward it are quite discernible to \nthem. They have the imagination to conceive ideas and the intelligence \nto translate them into practice. Finally, they have that most necessary \nattitude of affection for and faith in people, coupled with skill in human \nrelationships. \nLeaders with vision help various groups state their objectives clearly \nand formulate long-range plans that are within their power to achieve. \nThese plans succeed because they are based on an accurate knowledge of \nthe people and the community. The leaders are effective because they \nearn the respect and confidence of their fellows through zealous, enthusi- \nastic effort skilfully blended with tact, and because they have a genuine \ndesire to bring out the best in .every individual. \n", 'K U L L M A N  AND B U T T E R W O R T H  163 \nAlthough leadership in these programs is distributed among many.peo- \nple, the importance of the contribution made by school personnel, es- \npecially administrators, cannot be overemphasized. Superintendents and \nprincipals are in strategic positions and have obvious opportunities for \nleadership. In several of the situations described, the leadership lines led \nfrom superintendent and staff to board of education, students, parents, \nand community. Sometimes the program originated in the schools; some- \ntimes it was born elsewhere; in all cases it was nurtured and brought to \nfruition by many persons. \nCommunity Interest in School Projects \nThe reader will have noticed that initial success in some activity fre- \nquently stimulated adult interest, evoked greater co-operation, and re- \nsulted in improvement of the program. This success seemed to stimulate \nthe production and acceptance of new ideas for future accomplishment. \nMost of these ideas involved more and more people. Thus, little by little, \nthe activities developed until they reached their present proportions. \nSuccess in the small, beginning co-operative ventures seemed to pro- \nduce a contagious growth. \nUnderstanding often leads to desirable changes. The impact of a \nschool newspaper on life in a rural community is described in the article \non the program of the Mesick School. Awareness of the facts created a \ndesire for change, produced suggestions for betterment, and culminated \nin action. The ability of community organizations to support and aid the \nschool is vividly illustrated by one program. In another, a calamity be- \nci~me the starting point for a "new deal" in local education. The infre- \nquency of references to specialists and consultants may surprise some \nreaders. This may have been a result of oversight, or it may be tha~ \nperiodicals, books, and summer-school attendance must serve as the chief \nsources of knowledge in rural areas handicapped by distances and lack \nof funds. \nThe School as a Community Enterprise \nThe _programs of public relations carried on by these schools were \nsignificant. Their essential element was to make the school meaningful \nto the people of the community. The people understood that schools \nare, and should be, means to an end. The present and future welfare of \nchildren, adults, and the community as a whole constituted a common, \nprimary community objective, and the schools accepted their proper role \nin the task of achieving this objective. \nSome of the broader aspects of reorganization that will be of interest \nto rural educators are these: improvement of learning and living in small \nelementary schools that serve well the little children of the local com- \n', "164 P I L O T  PROGRAIVIS I N  R U R A L  E D U C A T I O N  \nmunity; (ormation of districts large enough to have adequate financial \nresources and sufficient pt{pil population to make expanded programs \nfeasible and economical; the broadening of so-called extra-class activities \nand their incorporation into a total curriculum; orientation of the educa- \ntional program not toward college preparation alone, but toward meeting \ncommunity needs--those of adults as well as school children; guidance \nof each pupil; the unit approach to the curriculum in the elementary \nschool; emphasis upon child development; recognition of the existence of \nindividual differences and provision for them; emphasis upon the family \nas a participating unit in community life; creation of lifelike situations \nin the schools wherein students play the roles they will play as adults; \nopportunity for students to participate as responsible citizens in com- \nmunity activities side by side with adults; emphasis upon community \nservice in the larger sense, as opposed to a public relations program de- \nvoted to decrying the lack of funds for traditional activities; emphasis \nupon making people aware of the school's role in community life; ex- \npanded plants suitable for many purposes, including that of a community \ncenter; and efficient and modern transportation systems. \nThe gains claimed for these programs are social in nature, an indica- \ntion that the schools are awake to their functions as agencies of society. \nUnfortunately, the evidence supporting these claims is not of such a \nnature as to be completely convincing. The gains.are difficult to measure \nand more difficult to credit solely to the school. There is a definite need \nfor evaluation of these educational programs. Few scientific attempts at \nevaluation are being conducted in these schools. Sound evidence, if favor- \nable, would do much to promote the introduction of similar programs in \nother schools. Nevertheless, the facts presented indicate these accom- \nplishments: reduced drop-outs, higher pupil interest, service to more \npeople, a longer school day and year; graduates who compete successfully \nin the business world and whose adjustment to life is better than that \nof their predecessors', and communities that are more self-sufficient and \nbetter places in which to live. \nThese programs attest that the rural school and its teachers can adapt \nthemselves to the needs of the place and the times. Rural life may have \nsocial and institutional limitations, but it lends itself well to modern \neducational practices that tend to break down the hierarchy of subject \nmatter, emphasize the child-development approach, and engender com- \nmunity co-operation. These programs should also help us realize that \nmany of the best features of these schools are independent of form or size \nof organization; they may be developed in one-room schools as well as in \nconsolidated schools. No rural community need be deprived of effective \neducation. \n"]</pre>
