The recent decision of the officials\nnot to give out news about our soldiers in the war until\nit is cabled from France means slow returns if the past\nis to be relied upon. We cannot believe that such an\norder would have been made unless some great military\nobjective requires it, and we hope the people here will\nnot grow impatient over the lack of Information.\nThat great moves are impending in France no one\ndoubts, More and more the. experts are coming to the\nconclusion that 1918 will prove decisive in the world war.\nThe Germans are attacking, they are the first to seek a\ndecisive victory; if they fail, the allies will try their hand\nand failure in that case means a deadlock, with years of\ndesultory warfare.
