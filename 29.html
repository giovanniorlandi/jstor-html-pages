A. Hardin, of\nMercer county, who was defeat\ned tor Congress by King Swope\nin the special\' election last Au\ngust, intends to try to stage a\n"come-back" and seek the demo\ncratic nomination again this\nyear. However, the report is\nconfirmed by the Stanford In\nterior Journal, the editor of\nwhich is Judge Hardin\'s Master\nCommissioner in Lincoln county\nand one of the closest men to\nhim in the state. .\nAccording to this, Judge Har\ndin will endeavor to retrieve the\nlaurels he lost to the young Re\npublican when the special, elec\ntion was held last fall, to fill the\nvacancy caused by the death of\nCongressman Helm- Just how\nhe will succeed in his ambition,\nwill be watched with much in\nterest all over the tate. For it\nis telling no secret, to state that\npoliticians nearly everywhere\nnave adjudged Judge Hardin "a\ndead one" politically after the\ndisastrous race he ran against\nSwope. Many predictions had\nbeen made that he would be\nsucceeded as Circuit Judge in his\njudicial "district. It lias been re\ncalled that he lost his own dis\ntrict, composed of the four coun\nties of Mercer; Boyle, Garrard\nand Lincoln by heavier majori\nties than any other counties in\nthe entire congressional district,\nwith perhaps the exception of\nShelby, which "fell down" heavi\nly, also. Political experts were\nsaid to have picked either At\ntorneys Kendrick S. Alcorn, ot\nStanford, or Henry Jackson, of\nDanville, as certain to be the\nnext Circuit Judge in Hardin\'s\ndistrict. .\nThe -defeat, of-the- Democratic\nstat: ticket in the recent electior\nby 40,000 "fnajority construed\nby many as a complete repudia\ntion for the friends or machine\nof Senator Stanley, chief among\nwhom is Judge Hardin had lead\nmany to order flowers for the\npolitical bier of the Mercer\ncounty jurist and political lead\ner; Should he be able to con\nfound them, all by making a\n"come-back" where other nota\nbles like Jeffries, Willard, et al.,\nhad failed, his triumph will be the\nmore impressive.\nThe entrance of Hardin into\nthe congressional race, will there\nfore add, decided zest to the\ncontest. It is said to be prac\ntically certain that Hon. William\nII. Shanks, Lincoln, who ran such\na smashing race for Lieutenant\nGovernor, will be a candidate as\nwill Judge Ralph Gilbert, " of\nShelby. Others have been men\ntioned, as previously stated, in\ncluding Lieut- Col. Frank Ripy, of\nAnderson county, Gordon Mont\ngomery, of Adair county, Charles\nr Montgomery, ot Casey, county,\nJoe\' E. Robinson, of Garrard\ncounty and. E. B. Hoover, of\nJessamine county.\nIt is hardly probable that Mad\nison will have a candidate. Cir\ncuit Judge Shackelford, the most\navailable man from this county,\nis certain to be renominated and\nre-elected Circuit Judge in this\ndistrict next year without oppo\nsition. Friends already are be\nginning to talk of him as the\nlogical man\' for the democrats to\nredeem the state with as. head of\nticket in the next governorship\nrace. Democracy will not be able\nto find a leader who\ncan rescue the party from its re\ncent disaster with greater ease or\nprove a more formidable ana\ncapable candidate for governor,\nin every way, say friends of\nJudge ; Shackelford. So it is\nhighly probable that he will not\nbe permitted to enter : the con\ngressional stakes, but will be re\nserved, for a greater service for\nhis party in 1923.\nAs far as the republican con\ngressional nomination is cpneern-\n,ed there will be " nothing to it\nI but King Swope, the "boy won\nder who handed- Judge Hardin\nsuch a solar plexus blow last\nAugust. Swope is in high favor\nwith his party. The big leaders\nare said to be ready to go to the\nbat for " him when ; the time\ncomes.

Engle as magistrate\ntor the Berea district of Madison\ncounty to succeed Squire Isaacs-\nresigned. Squire Isaacs work as a\ntraveling salesman keeps him\naway most of the time and he has\nbeen unable to attend the sessions\nof the court regularly, so that the\nBerea section of the county has\nhad little representation when the\nmagistrates have met. Squire\nEngle will be cn hand regularly\nand his appointment will give\ngeneral satisfaction, it is said.\nCOPPER "WORMS"\nARE IN DEMAND\nBy mistake an express messenger or.\na Cincinnati Southern southbound\ntrain put off at Moreland, in Lincoln\ncounty a large copper "worm\'\'. It !\nseems it was addressed to parties at.\nHuntsville and the express messen\nger evidently thought it said Huston\nville, which is in Lincoln county and\nof which Moreland is the shipping\npoint. Huntsville, it develops is ir.\nClinton county, and the "worni"\nshould have been carried further\nsouth.. The Stanford Journal opinea\nthat some one is evidently going in\nto moonshing business down in Clin\nton county. Clinton is right on the\nTennessee border and is said to be a\nprofitable field for the festive \'shiner,\nas he can dodge hack and forth\nacross the state line.\nBut Richmond had the distinction\nof furnishing a lot of copper or brass\npiping the other day to a couple of\ngentlemen from up ip Brcathilt coun\nty. They patronized a local plumb\ning store and bought a lot of small\nsized piping. Neither suggested the\npurpose to which it" was to be put,\nbut a gentleman who knows the\nvaried uses of small sized piping re\nmarked that there was liUle else that\nthe size and quantity they bough\'\ncould be used for except -first cla3:;\nmoonshine still.\nIttVINE BANK PRESIDENT\nINJURED BY FALL ON ICE\nMr. E.

But that remains\nto be seen, and some very mter\nesting politics is apt to be seen in\ntnis district, tms season, nor oniy\nin the scramble for the demo\ncratic nomination but in the final\nelection. :\nTHE MARKETS\nCincinnati Hogs 25c to 50c\nJower; $15; Chicago lower; cattle\nslow and steady.\nLouisville, Jan- 12 Cattle 1700\nslow; tops $13.50; hogs 4,000; 25c\nlower; tops $14.75; sheep 100;\nsteady and unchanged.\nV\n20 DEMOCRATS\nMAY COMPROMISE\nWashington, Jan. 12 Approxi\nmately 20 democratic Senators\nmet last night at the home of\nSenator Robert L.

E. F., for the period\nof 1817-1918. It was found In France\nthat the old theory that the prop\nosition of horse strength , to man\nstrength In armies should be two to\ntire was erroneous. One horse for\nevery two men was needed. To their\nastonishment the officers of the re\nmount service, many of whom had\nnever seen the Inside of a military\ntext book until a few weeks before\nthey received their commissions, dis\ncovered that six hundred horses were\nrequired to equip a single infantry\nregiment of war strength, that If? ?\nregiment of 3G0O to CS0O men.\nIt was next to Impossible to obtain\nhorses In sufficient numbers to\nproperly - equip even the artillery,\ntransport and ambulance services oi\nthe A. E. F., because, for a period t:\ntwo years before the participation o;\nthe United States in the conflict thf\nentente allies had been draining th\'\ncountry of horses of all sorts a no\nkinds. The A. E. F. had no cavalry.\n\' Modern Armies Are Large.\nNowadays armies are reckoned bj\nhundreds of thousands, if not b\nmillions. The -strength of a single\ndivision of the A. E. F was greatei\nin men and horses than the bigges.\narmy commanded by Stonewall Jack\nson in his entire career. The com\nbined armies of Lee and Meade thai\ntook part in the struggle of Gettys\nburg could have done no more in th.\ntitanic conflict that terminated las;\nNovember than hold two-score of\nmiles of the western front. If Un\nunited States were called to arms,\nwhether to defend some interes:\npeculiarly our own or to fulfill\nLeague of Nations obligation, the\nmobilization of from 500,000 to 1,000,-\n000 soldiers might be necessary. If\nthe old theory that the correct pro\nportion of horse strength to man\nstrength in armies was still accepted\nby military opinion, 200,000 horses\nwould bo required for the outfitting of\nhalf a million soldiers, 400,000 for the\noutfitting of a force of 1,000,000 and,\nIf an army of half a million or a\nmillion soldiers had to be kept in the\nHeld in a state of military efficiency\na reserve of 400,000 to 800,000 would\nbe necessary. If the future mllitarj\nforces of the United States are to bo\noutfitted with horses on a one to two\nbasis with adequate reserves, and\nsuch a scheme of outfitting would br\nnecessary If the armies of the United\nStates were to attempt intervention\nIn Mexico to protect American o\'\nKuropean interests In the maintenance\nof the Mouroe Doctrine, it will bi\nnecessary to provide an iinmcdiat\nmobilization force of from 250,000 to\n500,000 with reserves equally strong.\nToday the United States could no\nproperly outfit with horses an arm;\nof 100,000 soldiers. There are horse\nIn the country, many of them. But\nthey are mostly draught horses Nor\nmans, Percherons, Clydesdales, Bel\ngiaus, Shires, etc. whose military use\nfulness Is limited to the dragging o\nheavy artillery. Horses of these\ntypes are not in the least serviceable\nto a mobile army, or an army of\nmaneuver, as the new phrase de\nscribes an army that must perform\nmarches of fifteen to twenty miles a\nday or retreat quickly If strategy sug\ngests retreat. They are too sluggish,\ntoo lacking in spirit. The horses that\nare wanted are the light types and of\nthese there are so few the aggregate\nmay properly be said to be a\nnegligible quantity in any practical\nscheme of national defense. The gaso\nline motor long since made the pro\nduction of this type of horse un\nprofitable. Farmers and . stockmen\nhave ceased to raise light horse In\nconsiderable numbers. The creation of\na new supply must be stimulated by\nthe United States government, but\nnothing the. government could -do\nwould suffice If there was any inter\nference with the production of\nthoroughbred stallions. Stallions of\nthe thoroughbred types are indispen\nsible because the offspring of such\nstallions, whether , from mares of\nthoroughbred blood or from mares of\nno particular breeding, r proved best\nIn a half century of experimentation\nconducted In Europe by the great\nmilitary powers before the outbreak\nof the war of nations and the half\nand three-quarter bred outstayed and\noutgamed the representatives of the\ncolder breeds under the hard con\nditions of actual \'warfare - between\n,1914 and 1918.\n- ; light Horse Not Raised\nSince it Is no longer profitable for\nfanners and, stockmen\' to. raise light\nharness horses -for the market officers\nof the military service who have\nstudied the problem of military horse\nsupply, most deeply have declared in\nreromuaendatns to the senergl staff\n1,000 run of-mills, Canvas Gloves\nOur price\n50 Boys Gray Outing Shirts\nOur price . t-\n50 pairs Lace Curtains, samples at\nWorth double the price\nit asiiington anu to congress ma:\nhe government must obtain an-l\n.ilace at tlie disposal of farmers in\ni-ctions of the country in which horse\nuny be raised most economically bt\nween 4CKX) and 8000 thoroughbre.i\nnallions. A beginning lias been made\nn this tivmendous work, but no moif\nban a beginning. The remotuu\niervico has placed in- Virginia, New\nt\'ork, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas V.n.i\nn the fur west some seventy-five oi\neighty thoroughbred stallions, anJ\n.hese stallions have, almost without\nexception, been the cheerful gifts of\nthoroughbred producers and persons\nintorested In racing.\nIt is because of the government\'s\ninsurmountable ne d of thorougl\'.nreu\nblood that the most distinguished\nofficers of the regular military servuv\nhave, been so outspoken In -theii\nopposition to half baked legislation\nthat might interfere with thorough\nbred production. MnJor-(5enerat\nLeonard Wood was the first officer, of\nhigh rank to declare himself publicly\non this subject. In 1911 when\nthoroughbred stallions and mares by\nthe hundreds were being shipped out\nof the country because the shutting\ndown of racing in New. York state in\nconsequences of the Ilughes anti-racing\nlegislation of- 1908 and 1910\nclosed the metropolitan market to\nthoroughbred producers, General Wood\nannounced in the dally press that the\nloss of thoroughbred blood had\'ns\nsumed the proportions of a national\ncalamity, and that if something were\nnot done by the government to check\nthe exportation of such stock and to\nrevive production it would be im\nposible to properly outfit with horses\nan army of the size the United States\nwould have to put in the field if Ave\ncame in conflict with a first-class\npower. The prophesy of General\nWood was to be abundantly fulfilled\nIn 1917 and 1918 as had already been\npointed out. v \'\nOppose Anti-Racing Laws.\n\' When the hearings on the anti-racing\nbills in Maryland\'s legislature\nwere held a year ago last winter\nwere on General Andrew Hero, com\nmander of the Artillery Brigade oi\nthe Division of draught troops that\nwas training at - Camp Meade, and\nColonel Raymond Brlggs, of the 311t\'i\nfield artillery, who. afterwards be\ncame brigadier-general because of his\ndistinguished service In . the field,\nappeared before the judicial proceed\nings committee of the senate and pro\ntested - against legislative inter\nference with thoroughbred production.\nMa jor-General Kuhn and Brigadier\nGeneral Nicholson, respectively, com\nmander and second in command of\nthe Camp Meade Division, were un\nable on account of business to appear\nbefore the house, judiciary committea\nat the - last hearing, but they\nauthorized representative speakers\nagainst the pending legislation In their\nsanies.
