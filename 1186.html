NOVEMBER 4, 1009.\nMEN PROMINENT\nIN MINING WORLD\nVISIT TONOPAH\nFULL TEXT\nOF THE FRANCHISE\nREAFFIRMED\nAre Looking Over Mining Situation and\nto Study Possibilities of the Camp.\nCharle3 G. Hubbard and Dr. Ed\nward L. Fester, .prominent mining\nmen in this country and Alaska, are\nguests at the Mizpah hotel, where\nthey arrived last evening.\nThe gentlemen, who claim San\nDiego as their home, are here for\nthe purpose of looking into the min\ning conditions of the camp, and to\nstudy the possibilities of this end of\nthe state.\nTheir - interest in mining has ex\ntended from one country to another,\nfinally consummating in the sale of\nthe largest area of copper ground,\naccording to geological reports, in\nthe world.\nThis property is located in the\nCopper- river district, about 130\nmiles from Valdez, Alaska, and has\nbut recently been transferred to the\nmanagement of Baron Leopold\nHirsch & Co., who, together with\nthe Havemyers and J. Pierpont Mor\ngan, will develop the wonderful de-\'l\nposits there found.\nThe area covered by the holdings\nis described as nine miles long by\none mile wide, while developments\nat a depth of about 1000 feet have\nshown the continuation of the enor\nmous veins with depth, and estab\nlished beyond question the fact that\nthcro exists one of the most gigan\ntic deposits of copper, averaging, it\nla said, from 30 to 70 per cent.\nMr. Hubbard said yesterday that\nthe deal, which was closed about\nAugust 26, represented a cash pur\nchase price of $40,500,000, and thaf\nalready a railroad under the super\nvision of the agents of J. Pierpont\nMorgan had been constructed from\nCordova toward Copper river for a\ndistance of about 93 miles, with\nthe expectation that the full dis\ntance would be completed within the\nnext six months.\'\nAmong the many things which\nbring attention of Nevada possibil\nities to the prominent men, is the\nfact that Mr. Hubbard is the first\nwhite boy born in the state east o\nCarson City. His father, Judge\nCharles G. Hubbard, nearly 25\nyears ago occupied the federal bench\nas circuit judge of the United States\nfor a period of nearly 12 years\nleaving the state for California at\nthe time the present visitor to the\ncitv was about 17 years of age.\nDuring the time Judge Hubbard\nwas on the bench in this state he\nrendered decisions which have since\ntaken their place alongside of the\nmost important in mining matters\nnow cited in similar cases. It was\npeculiar that in a lawsuit in which\nbis son was engaged not many year;\nago, Judge Farrington, the .present\nfederal judge, decided the impor\ntant case upon the opinion written\nby Judge Hubbard many years ago\nMr. Ilubard -said last night that\nhe was surprised at the develop\nment of Nevada, and that he felt\npeculiar in the face of the fact that\nhis boyhood was spent in a country\nwhich had since become the most\nimportant, aside from the far north\nin the whole world.\nHe has spent the major portion\nof the last 12 years in Alaska, go\ning into the country when the first\nrush was on in Valdez. Instead of\nfollowing the trail of the. gold seek\ner, he stopped on Copper river, and\nmade the locations which have but\nlately resulted in his immense for\ntune.\nHe held to the copper properties\nand that his judgment was good\nshown by the fact that the richest\noT OT\'thF\'TaptaTnTrt\ndustry sought him out and tried to\nsecure his holdings. Eventually the\nprice, which bad been fixed as the\nreasonable value of the ground, was\noffered, and today Mr. Hubbard\nwho maintains headquarters in thl\ncountry at Chicago, where he is the\nhead of the firm of Hubbard, Elliott\n& Co., is independent and sangum\nof the result of the enorimous work\nto be done on his cherished ground\nat the hands of the parties men\ntioned.

P. Dunlap, in connection with the proceedings had on\nMonday, both in the afternoon and at the evening mass meeting,\nregarding the question of additional and adequate fire protection\nfor Tonopah.\nWhile the paper in question may not be aware of it, and in\nview of the fact that it seems unable to employ sufficient reportor\nlal assistance to present in truthful or verified form even the cur\nrent local news, it is fair to assume that it either wilfully pre\nferred to misrepresent the facts or was too indolent to ascertain\nthe truth the meeting held on Monday afternoon in Mr. Brown\'s\noffices wa one to which all of the business men of Tonopah avail\nable on short notice were invited and which many of them at\ntended, instead of there being but four present to discuss the\nquestion at issue with Mr. Wheeler, there were as a matter of\nfact twenty persons present, among them being Messrs. John Kir\nchen, Robert I,, Prouty, R. PTOunlap, S. R. Moore, George B.\nThatcher, R. B; Davis, A. G. Raycraft, E. L. Kidd, R. B. Govan,\nHugh H. Drown, Roger Stenson, W. S. Johnson, R. C. Moore, Zeb\nKendall, .1. J. McQuillan, W. W. Booth, Harry Martin, H. E. Ep\nstine, J. G. Crumley and C. H. Mcintosh all of them representa\ntive men of Tonopah, seeking her material advancement and inter\nested in her material welfare, property owners and substantial cit\nizens. There may have been more present whose names have\nbeen inadvertently overlooked. Certain it is that many others\nwho could be reached on short notice were asked to be in attend\nance, but for reasons best known to themselves were unable, to\nbe present.\nThe discussion was a purely informal one, for the purpose of\nascertaining, if possible, what\' the water company proposed to do\ntoward installing the required additional fire protection. Those in\nattendance appointed a special committee consisting of Messrs. Ep\nHtine, Dunlap, Thatcher and Mcintosh to confer with Mr. Wheeler\nfor the outlining of a definite line of work by the water company\nfor the installation of the added protection demanded.\' The agree\nment of the company in that regard is a matter of history, and\nwas stated nl the mass meeting on Monday evening, being then\nconfirmed and rataified by Mr. Wheeler.\nAt th mass meeting on Monday evening, Mr. Dunlap, far\nfrom assuming to direct things, was requested by W. W. Booth of\nthe Bonanza, the paper that was initially instrumental in the call\ning of the meeting and the action taken, nnd by. many others pres\nent, to call the meeting to order which function was the begin\nning and ending of his attempt to run "things." as the evening pa\nper untruthfully states. ,\nThe chairman of the mass meeting was elected by nomina\ntion and viva voce vote of those present, as was also Mr. R.I C.\nMoore, the secretary. The motion of Mr. Dunlap regarding the re\naffirming of the water company\'s franchise served merely for the\npurpose of placing the matter before the meeting, and the onlv\npersonal feeling or selfish Interest displayed was involved in the\ntirade of the editor of the paper in question, who arose and was\nrecognized to discuss the question but who could not be prevented\nfrom wandering into the field of his own personal grievances; the\nmeeting was for the settlement and discussion of the larger inter\nests of the community involved in its adequate protection from\n, fire by the installation of additional hydrants and ,of pressure\ntanks on the higher elevations for the supply of those hydrants,\nand not for the airing of personal complaints of an individual na\nture such as those by him thrust upon those present.\nIn a word, as the result of the meeting of citizens at the of\nfices oS Mr. Brown on Monday afternoon and not through any ef\nfort or assistance of the evening paper the Tonopah United Wa\nter company, through its authorized representative, Mr. Wheeler,\nhas agreed with our citizens to install seven additional hydrants\non the higher residence elevations of Tonopah, to install pressure\nreservoirs on the still higher elevations for the purpose of sup\nplying water to those hydrants for fire purposes and to the resi\ndence sections for domestic purposes, to do this at its own cost\nand expense and at a rate of $7 per month per hvdrant for the\nfirst year and not more than $6 per month thereafter, and to be\ngin the work of installation at once and just as soon as the sur\nveys and estimates therefor can be completed.\nWhether the water company will keep faith with our pern\nremains for the people to say, but suffice it that if it does keep\nthat faith and the protection promised be installed as agreed,\nnone of tho credit for that hoped for and expected result can pos\nsibly accrue to the paper in question or to its editor, who confines\nhis efforts to his individual troubles and to unwarranted attacks\nunfounded and untruthful in Tact, upon those who have freely\nRiven their time and efforts for the benefit of the entire\' community.\nDELAYS ARE DANGEROUS.\nWhen the board of county commissioners reduced the person\nnel of the fire department one member, at its meeting in October\nthe action did not meet with the approval of the people of Tono\npah. The alarm which called out the department last evening was\nample demonstration that at least three men, in addition to the\nchief, are required. In the harnessing of the team, two mem\nbers are needed while a third should occupy the seat. Last night\nthere was hut one of the men in the house at the time the alarm\nwas turned in, the other being at dinner, in the hurrw that usu\nally accompanies the responding to an alarm, one of the horses\nwas not prbperly hitched, causing a delay of several minutes.\nThe accident was one that might happen at any time when the\nforce is short handed. And there will be numerous occasions\nwhen one of the members of the department is absent. These\noccasions are necessary and cannot be avoided. A delay of tven\nthree minutes is a serious matter when responding to a blaze, and\nthe ultimate result will be that Tonopah will again be the scene\nof a disastrous conflagration, for which the blame will rest upon\nthe heads of the county commissioners.\nIf a retrenchment is needed in the affairs of the town, let\nthe reduction bo made in some other way and not by an action\nwhere a few dollars saved will result In hundreds of dollars lost\nTemperature Report\nYesterday\'s hourly temperature\nrecord at the weather bureau office\nwas aa follows:\n5 a. m rl\na. in 51\n7 a. m 51\nX a. in 53\n9 a. m r.r,\n10 a. in. 59\n11 a. i fil\n1 2 ( noon\n1 p. in\n2 p. in\n.1 p. m\n4 p. in\nfl p.
