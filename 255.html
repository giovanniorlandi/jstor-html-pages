There is a real possiblity that international influence can help generate \ndomestic pressure in support o f Japan ’s official goals o f expanding energy sources and domestic \ndemand. ”\nJapan’s Energy Policy\nBy Shigeko N. Fukai\nDirector, Japan Programs, Center for International Commerce, Auburn University\nJ\na p a n  has practically no domestic fossil fuels except \nfor coal, which has been too expensive to compete \nwith im ported oil since the 1950’s. Ja p a n ’s rapid eco\xad\nnomic growth before the oil crisis o f 1973 was \nachieved by taking full advantage of an abundance of \ncheap oil supplied by the U nited States-basec interna\xad\ntional oil com panies.1 T he oil crises of 1973 and 1979 \nshook the foundation of Ja p a n ’s energy policy and in\xad\nstitutions, which had evolved within the framework of \n“the relatively stable postwar petroleum regime, m an\xad\naged by the large oil firms and protected by American \ndiplomatic and military strength.”2 Since 1973, measures \nhave been im plemented to conserve energy and diversify \nenergy sources to reduce dependency on oil. In spite of \nthe considerable success of this effort, Jap an  still depends \non im ported oil for nearly 60 percent of its energy needs; \nabout 70 percent o f this oil comes from the Middle East \nthrough the Strait o f H orm uz. Energy security—how to \nsecure a stable energy supply — continues to be the cen\xad\ntral issue in Jap an ’s energy policy. Since the mid-1980’s, \nhowever, the oil glut and the sharp increase in the yen’s \nvalue have drastically changed the environm ent for \nJa p a n ’s energy policy.\nT he m ajor actors in Ja p a n ’s energy policy-making are \ngovernm ent agencies, industry groups, Liberal Dem o\xad\ncratic party (LD P) m em bers and energy specialists. The \ngeneral pattern of policy-making has been that the m in\xad\nistry officials formulate a policy by consulting advisory \ncouncils, to which industry and other interested groups \nare invited, in addition to energy specialists and govern\xad\nm ent agency representatives.

It is difficult to \ndeterm ine where policy initiatives originate, but obser\xad\nvers generally agree that m inistry officials make propo\xad\nsals based on their participation in various institu\xad\ntionalized channels, like advisory councils and study \ngroups. This system provides stability in policy but, as \ncritics note, it makes innovative change difficult.3\nENERGY POLICY, 1945-1973\nD uring the period of rapid economic growth that \nbegan with reconstruction after W orld W ar II and con\xad\ntinued until the 1973 oil crisis, Jap an ’s energy consum p\xad\ntion increased 7-fold and the consum ption o f petroleum \nincreased 32-fold. Between 1960 and 1973, Ja p a n ’s oil \nconsum ption increased twice as fast as other m ajor in\xad\ndustrial countries. Jap an ’s energy policy before the first \noil crisis evolved roughly through three phases: the oc\xad\ncupation period from 1945 to 1951; the period of eco\xad\nnomic reconstruction from the early 1950’s to 1960; and \nthe high economic growth period from the early 1960’s \nthrough 1972.\nThe postwar coal shortage created a critical bottleneck \nin the progress of economic recovery in Jap an . Energy \npolicy during this period (1945-1951) focused on in\xad\ncreasing coal and steel production. Initially, m ining \ncompanies expanded production by increasing labor \nrather than by modernizing facilities. Shortly thereafter, \nthey im plemented economic stabilization policies and \nboth subsidies and reconstruction funds were ter\xad\nm inated. Inflation was controlled, but a severe recession \nfollowed and the coal industry shifted its emphasis from \nproduction expansion to rationalization. In effect, this \npolicy fostered the dependence of the coal industry on \ngovernm ent support instead of encouraging self-help ef\xad\nforts to make it competitive.\nIm mediately after the war, in order to demilitarize \nand deconcentrate the Japanese economy, the Suprem e \nC om m ander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) placed the oil \nindustry under strict control. However, as the cold war \ndeveloped, the Allied powers sought to foster a stable\n169\n', '170 •  CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1988\nanti-C om m unist regim e by prom oting economic recov\xad\nery. In  1948, seven m ajor Japanese oil com panies were \nexem pted from the deconcentration policy.\nT he K orean W ar in 1950 provided Japanese industry \nwith timely “special (procurem ent) dem ands” and helped \nthe economy move into an expansive cycle. T he energy \nindustry underw ent reorganization. From 1949 to 1952, \nthe oil com panies, lacking the capital to build new \nrefineries, entered into capital and technology tie-ups \nwith A m erican oil companies. (It is noteworthy that \nthese tie-ups were made under the Foreign Investm ent \nAct, which was later applied with a strongly protectionist \nflavor.)4 D uring this period, Japanese policymakers \nwere concerned prim arily with securing crude oil at the \nlowest possible price.\nT he  Japanese economy regained its prew ar level of \nproduction in 1951, which was also the year in which \nJa p a n  concluded its peace treaty with the U nited States. \nT he announced national goal was to establish an in\xad\ndependent economic foundation, i.c ., to become self- \nsupporting w ithout U nited States aid or special p ro\xad\ncurem ents. T he  “energy revolution," the shift from coal \nto oil as a m ajor energy source, supported this process.\nG overnm ent energy policy dem onstrated confusion \nand tended to fall behind the developm ent o f events be\xad\ncause it was dictated by two contradictory goals: to pro\xad\ntect domestic coal production and to reduce the cost of \nenergy, which entailed the prom otion of oil. Energy sup\xad\nply plans continuously overestim ated the supply of coal, \nwhich began to decline after reaching its peak in 1961, \nand underestim ated the need for oil, which surpassed the \nneed for coal in 1962.\nD uring this period (1951-1960), foreign ownership \nwas estim ated at between 50 percent and 75 percent of \nthe oil refining and oil distribution industries. M IT I’s \npolicy of not im porting processed products m eant that \nJa p a n  needed a huge refinery industry. Lacking \ndomestic capital, M IT I continued to allow foreign oil \ncom panies to supply the cheap oil and the capital needed \nto rebuild and m odernize the refinery industry. At the \nsame time, however, M IT I took action to reduce the \nforeign companies’ share of the Japanese m arket by us\xad\ning its allocation powers. It also initiated and supported \nprojects to develop Japanese oil sources outside the con\xad\ntrol of big foreign com panies. T he cost o f domestic coal \nproduction becam e m uch higher than that o f im ported \ncoal and crude oil. T he  governm ent subsidized the shu t\xad\n4In March, 1949, Japan’s largest refinery company, Nippon \nOil, signed a refining and sales contract with Caltex. This \nmeant that the oil industry in Japan would follow a policy to re- \nline in the consuming country; thus American oil companies \ndeveloped their huge crude oil reserves at negligible costs. As \nthe United States restricted oil imports, the oil companies based \nin the United States decided to develop new markets for low- \ncost crude oil in Europe andjapan.\n5Raymond Vernon, Two Hungry Giants: The United States and \nJapan in the Quest for Oil and Ores (Cambridge: Harvard U niversi- \nty Press, 1963), p. 92.\ndown of inefficient coal pits and the m odernization of re\xad\nm aining pits, bu t coal failed to rem ain competitive.\nT he rapidly expanding energy dem and drove the elec\xad\ntric power industry to concentrate on the construction of \nnew power plants. M IT I encouraged the introduction of \nforeign capital and technology in the transform ation \nfrom hydroelectric to therm al power plants. A pattern \nwas established in which a therm al power plant was \nm anufactured by Japanese  com panies under a licensing \nagreem ent with U nited States companies.\nIn this period, oil became the most im portant fuel and \nraw m aterial resource supporting Ja p a n ’s economic \ngrowth. S tarting in the early 1950’s, the consum ption of \nheavy oil increased dram atically as the paper and pulp, \ntextile, and food industries shifted from coal to oil. T he \ncity gas industry also shifted from coal to oil. Rapidly ex\xad\npanding consum ption caused cut-throat com petition in \nthe oil industry. Since M IT I allocated im port quotas ac\xad\ncording to past perform ances, com petition to expand \nm arket shares intensified, causing the excessive com peti\xad\ntion that characterizes the industry today. Oil prices kept \nfalling, except for a brief period during  the Suez Incident \nin 1957; this severely weakened the financial base of the \nindustry.\nT he energy revolution advanced at full speed from \n1960 to 1972 with the liberalization of oil im ports. The \npresence of low-cost M iddle East oil fueled Ja p a n ’s rapid \neconomic growth. T he foundation for nuclear power \ngeneration was also set on the basis of technology im\xad\nported from the U nited States. But the coal industry \ndeepened its dependency on governm ent aid and failed \nto m odernize.\nT he  Petroleum  Industry Law (P IL ) of 1962 set the \ncourse o f ja p a n ’s energy policy in the 1960’s. T he PIL ’s \ngoals were “to insure a  stable and low-cost oil supply \nthrough rationalization and proper coordination of the \nrefinery business and thereby to prom ote economic \ngrowth and im prove living standards.” Specifically, \nM IT I sought to control the “excessive com petition” that \nafflicted the industry, and to expand independent \nsources of oil supply by encouraging exploration for oil \nby Japanese  com panies.5\nT he law em pow ered M IT I to license refineries, ap\xad\nprove refinery equipm ent, draw  up energy supply plans, \nand prom ote production plans and  crude oil acquisition \nplans. Although inspection and sanction powers were \ngreatly weakened, the act made M IT I the central institu\xad\ntion to supervise the developm ent o f the oil industry. The \nrapidly increasing dem and for oil (at an annual rate of \n16.4 percent) made the licensing of refineries an ex\xad\ntremely effective instrum ent for control. T o  correct the \novcrsupply situation, M IT I used adm inistrative guid\xad\nance to adjust production plans and announced standard \nprices to counter the sharp decline of prices caused by ex\xad\ncessive com petition. In spite o f liberalization on paper, \nM IT I continued to control oil product imports.\nIn the area of nuclear power generation, U nited States\n', "Japan’s Energy Policy •  171\ncompanies started to sell reactors on a commercial basis \nin 1963. They adopted a strategy to recover research and \ndevelopm ent expenses by overseas sales. At the time, the \nJapanese were interested in saving research and develop\xad\nment costs. Again, the pattern that emerged was to im\xad\nport foreign technology rather than to invest in research \nand developm ent to build up an indigenous technology. \nIn 1963-1966, all nine Japanese electric power \ncompanies ordered nuclear reactors from either West- \ninghouse or General Electric. T hus, except for the first \nreactor, which was im ported from the United K ingdom , \nthe reactors introduced during this period were all A m er\xad\nican light-water reactors.6\nA nother im portant developm ent was the aggravation \nof environm ental pollution caused by the mass consum p\xad\ntion of oil. T he Basic Law for Environm ental Pollution \nC ontrol was passed in 1967, followed by a series of pollu\xad\ntion control laws in subsequent years. M IT I formed a \nsubcom mittee on desulfurization in 1969 and, based on \nits recom mendations, prom oted the introduction of de\xad\nsulfurization equipm ent and plants through ad\xad\nministrative guidance backed by a set of tax incentives.\nIn the late 1960’s, a scries o f international develop\xad\nm ents made Japanese policymakers increasingly wary of \nthe eventual end of the era of cheap oil. For instance, in \n1967 Iran  embarked on the nationalization of oil (a goal \nachieved in 1972), and the nationalist regime established \nin Libya in 1969 raised its oil prices. M IT I increased its \neffort to diversify and expand national control over sup\xad\nply sources, but it was not prepared for the kind of oil \nsupply disruption that occurred in 1973-1974.\nTHE OIL CRISES\nAt the time of the first energy crisis in 1973, 77.6 per\xad\ncent of Ja p a n ’s energy supply was oil, 80 percent of which \nwas im ported from the M iddle East. Panic buying and \nhoarding by trading firms recreated the sense of scarcity \nof the im mediate postwar days. Until the crisis, Japanese \npolicymakers hac fallen abundant cheap oil for granted \nand had allowed the m arket to determ ine the energy sup\xad\nply structure. Although M IT I had introduced m an\xad\ndatory oil stocks to be held by refineries (60 days of pro\xad\nduction) as a requisite for obtaining approval o f refinery \nequipm ent in 1970, the oil em bargo had an enorm ous \npsychological impact on policymakers and the public.\nThe immediate response was to dispatch a delegation \nheaded by Deputy Prim e M inister Takeo M iki to ap\xad\npease the O rganization of A rab Petroleum Exporting \nC ountries (O A PEC) and shift Ja p a n ’s foreign policy \nposture from neutral to pro-Arab. Ja p a n  was reclassified \nby OAPF.C as a friendly country in Jan u ary , 1974.\nT he following month, Jap an  participated in the W ash\xad\nington Conference convened by the U nited States and \nbecame a mem ber of the International Energy Program\nS endai Gijutsu-shi Kcnkyukai (Modem Technology Study \nGroup), Energui Mondai (Energy Problems) (Tokyo: Shankai \nHyoron-sha, 1984), p. 159; Kitada, opcit., p. 110.\n(IEP). 'The IEP agreem ent provided for a goal of a \n90-day oil stockpile for 1980. In O ctober, 1974, M IT I \ndrafted a plan to achieve this goal between 1975 and\n1980, and it enacted the Oil Stockpile Act in 1975. In\n1981, the refinery companies achieved this goal, but \nargued that oil stockpiles beyond running stock should be \na governm ent responsibility because they concerned na\xad\ntional security. In fact, Ja p a n  is the only country that ob\xad\nligates the private sector to m aintain a 90-day oil stock\xad\npile.\nT he Com prehensive Energy Council reexam ined the \nenergy policy and concluded in its report in August, \n1975, that “the new situation no longer perm its us to pu r\xad\nsue the three goals of abundance, low cost and stabil\xad\nity—the oil policy of the high economic growth period. \nW e have to choose stability as the priority goal.” T o \nachieve this goal, the report called for reduction of de\xad\npendency on oil and diversification of nonoil energy sup\xad\nplies; securing a stable oil supply; energy conservation; \nand research and development of new energy sources. \nT o stabilize the oil supply, it emphasized the importance \nof shifting from dependence on oil majors to direct deals \nand governm ent-to-governm ent deals, which would be \nprom oted through active participation in oil develop\xad\nm ent and economic cooperation.\nT he report also defined energy conservation as “the \nmeans to achieve more effective use of energy without af\xad\nfecting economic perform ance, living standards, en\xad\nvironm ent and safety” and regarded conservation as the \nbest way to increase energy security free from in terna\xad\ntional events. A variety of financial aids were introduced \nto increase energy efficiency and conservation, including \nlow-interest Jap an  Development Bank loans for the in\xad\nstallation of energy-saving equipm ent in factories, and \nspecial financing for the insulation of residential \nbuilding. 'Tax deductions and special depreciation have \nbeen extended to energy-saving equipm ent. Jap an ’s \nenergy conservation has been generally regarded as a \nsuccess am ong the industrial countries.\nT he second oil crisis precipitated by the Iranian Revo\xad\nlution in 1979 was followed by the confirmation of the \nshared interest am ong the oil-consuming countries in re\xad\nducing the dem and for oil to stabilize the world oil m ar\xad\nket. They shared the goals of increasing control over \nenergy sources and energy supply reliability. After the \nfirst energy crisis, Ja p a n ’s oil consum ption decreased for \ntwo years, but in 1979 it increased to approach the peak- \nyear consum ption of 1973. T hat year, Jap an  accounted \nfor 10 percent of the total energy consum ption of the 24 \nmem bers of the O rganization for Economic C ooperation \nand Development (O EC D ).\nT he second energy crisis provided Jap an ’s policy\xad\nmakers with stronger incentives to develop and introduce \nalternative energy sources. T he far sharper price in\xad\ncreases made the introduction of alternative and new \nenergy sources economically feasible.

It was not a  shortage in the volume of oil supply, \nbu t price increases and their disruptive im pact that most \nconcerned the Japanese governm ent and private in\xad\ndustry .7\nT hus, renewed emphasis was placed on alternative \nenergy and new energy sources. The governm ent al\xad\nready had started the Sunshine project in 1974, which \nwas an extensive, long-term technological developm ent \nprogram  to develop clean, alternative energy sour\xad\nces—solar, geothermal, coal and hydrogen energy—for \nJa p a n ’s basic energy. The M oonlight project was found\xad\ned in 1978 to develop large-scale, basic technologies for \nenergy conservation and energy-saving technologies for \ndevices used in the household and commercial sectors.8\nIn M ay, 1980, the governm ent enacted and imple\xad\nm ented an “Act to Prom ote Development and Introduc\xad\ntion of Alternative Energy to O il,” commonly known as \nthe Alternative Energy Act. Research and development \nof alternative energy sources was estim ated to cost some \nY3 trillion through 1990 and secured long-term funding \nfrom an “electric power sources developm ent prom otion \ntax” and an “oil policy special account.”\nT he Alternative Energy Act makes the governm ent \nresponsible for setting long-term supply targets for alter\xad\nnative energies like coal and nuclear power and new \nenergy or renewable energy sources; advising industry to \nintroduce alternative energies; and providing budgetary, \nfinancial and tax incentives to prom ote energy conserva\xad\ntion efforts. In O ctober, 1980, the New Energy Develop\xad\nm ent O rganization (N E D O ) was established to develop \nlarge-scale alternative energy projects.\nIndustry, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of \nJap an ’s energy consum ption, continued to introduce \nenergy-saving technology. In addition, significant \nenergy conservation was gained through the economic \nstructural change away from energy-intensive industries \nto an increasing concentration on low-energy, high-tech\xad\nnology sectors like integrated circuits and computers. \nPetrochemicals, textiles and the traditional “metal\n7Ronald Morse, “Japanese Energy Policy,” in Wilfrid L. \nKohl, cd., After the Second Oil Crisis (Lexington, Mass.: Lex\xad\nington Books, 1982), p. 261.\n8Masoa Sakisaka, “Energy Alternatives: Present State and \nFuture Problems,’\'Journal ofJapanese Trade and Industry (Novem- \nber-Dcccmber, 1983), pp. 25-29; Morse, Politics, p. 10.\n“Don Hedley, World Energy: The Facts and the Future (London: \nEuromonitor Publications, 1986), p. 261.\n\'“International Energy Agency, Energy Policies and Programs of \nthe IEA Countries: 1986 Review (Paris: Organization for Econom\xad\nic Cooperation and Development, 1987), p. 261.\n"In  1973, imported oil accounted for 77.6 percent of Japan’s \nenergy needs, of which 80 percent came from the Middle East; \nin 1986, imported oil supplied 56 percent of the Japanese \nenergy demand and Middle East oil imports were 60 percent of \ntotal oil imports.

T he dem and-supply situation eased \nand the crude oil price declined from $28 per barrel in \nthe first half o f fiscal year 1985 to $12.50 per barrel one \nyear later. In the sum m er of 1986, almost all spot prices \ndropped below $10 per barrel. T he im mediate cause of \nthe glut was O P E C ’s failure to agree on production \nquotas. T he oil glut was also a result o f the shrinking de\xad\nm and for oil caused by the deliberate policies o f in\xad\ndustrialized consum er countries to reduce dependence \non M iddle East oil, combined with the increased produc\xad\ntion of non-O PEC  oil stim ulated by higher oil prices \nafter the second oil crisis. After O PEC  agreed to reduce \nproduction, oil prices rose to around $18 per barrel. \nHowever, serious divisions are reported am ong O PEC  \nmem bers, particularly between Iran  and Saudi A rabia, \nabout the 1988 price and production levels.12\nJa p a n ’s response to the lower oil prices has been char\xad\nacterized by caution in anticipation of a  tighter oil m ar\xad\nket and a greater dependency on M iddle East oil in the \n1990’s.

Although \nthere is no indication that Prim e M inister T akeshita is \nthinking of sending defensive forces to the region, should \nhe or a future Japanese Prim e M inister desire to do so, \nNakasone’s statem ent on legality would make that action \nless controversial.22\nIn sum , under Yasuhiro Nakasone Jap an  made great \nstrides in defense capability and eliminated obstacles pre\xad\nventing the smooth assimilation of an effective future de\xad\nfense capability. Despite Prim e M inister Nakasonc’s ef\xad\nforts, Jap an  is not and may never become an “unsinkable \naircraft carrier.” Its security posture has been signi\xad\nficantly bolstered, however, and the prospects are bright \nfor a continuation of Pacific deterrence based on United \nStates and Japanese cooperation, with Jap an  playing an \nincreasingly significant role. ■\nJAPAN’S ENERGY POLICY\n(Continued from page 172)\nfrom Japanese companies. W ith a  target o f 30 percent \nfor the year 2000 (which some analysts consider too am \xad\nbitious), M IT I has been encouraging exploration and \ndevelopm ent o f oil by Japanese companies in overseas oil \nfields. It continues to provide loans through the Jap an  \nN ational Oil C orporation (JN O C ). W ith the yen’s rising \nvalue, however, buying oil reserves has become more \neconomical for Japanese companies that lack the clout to \ncompete with A m erican or European rivals.\nIn December, 1985, M IT I adopted a policy to liber\xad\nalize im ports of refined products including gasoline, \nkerosene and gas oil by enacting a provisional law. T he \nintegration of Ja p a n ’s oil industry into the world market \nwas also dem anded by Jap an ’s chemical industry, which \nwas suffering from the sharp appreciation of the yen. \nT he result has been a rapid increase in imports that has \nexceeded governm ent estimates in all categories.\nIn the face of Ja p a n ’s entry into foreign competition, \nanother M IT I goal has been to prom ote “structural re\xad\nform in the oil industry.” This entails “rationalization of \noil companies, reduction of surplus refinery capacity, de\xad\nvelopment of technology and measures to improve the oil \ndistribution sector.” In 1986, the Petroleum Energy C en\xad\nter was established to provide professional advice.\n', 'Articles Concluded •  183\nIn the electricity sector, the governm ent promotes nu \xad\nclear power as the main baseload supply source (or a \n“semi-domestic” source of energy), with added emphasis \non safety since the Chernobyl accident. Jap an ’s total n u \xad\nclear capacity in 1986 accounted for more than 27 per\xad\ncent of total electricity production in Jap an ; while oil- \npowered electricity accounted for less than 24 percent. \nT he governm ent takes the view that the generously fund\xad\ned public campaign about nuclear-power generation has \npaid off.13 T he new five year plan published in 1987 calls \nfor the im provem ent o f existing types of light w ater reac\xad\ntors, the development of program s to use plutonium  in \nthermal reactors, the introduction of the fast breeder \nreactor, the construction o f commercial spent nuclear \nfuel reprocessing plants and the establishment o f a radio\xad\nactive waste m anagem ent and disposal system to com \xad\nplete the fuel cycle. N uclear energy is regarded as the al\xad\nternative energy source with the most potential to \nenhance energy security.\nHydroelectric power, accounting for 4.2 percent of \nJa p a n ’s total energy supply in 1986, is the next largest in\xad\ndigenous energy source. T he governm ent provides re\xad\nsearch funds to standardize and develop medium- to \nsmall-size hydropower generators for mass production, \nand  subsidizes from 5 percent to 15 percent o f the con\xad\nstruction costs for the plants and 50 percent of the costs of \ndem onstration plants that use new technologies.\nLiquefied natural gas (L N G ), which is clean and easy \nto control, accounts for almost 10 percent o f the present \nenergy supply. It has been used increasingly in power \ngeneration in urban regions. M IT I estimates that by (he \nyear 2000, gas-fired power station capacity will increase \nfrom 11 percent in 1983 to 25 percent of total electricity \ngeneration and that gas consum ption will triple.\nOverall, cheap oil has tended to deprive energy con\xad\nservation and alternative energy developm ent projects of \ntheir incentives by making them comparatively expen\xad\nsive. In 1983 and 1984, Jap an ’s total energy dem and in\xad\ncreased, exceeding the rate predicted in the Long-Term  \nEnergy Supply and D em and O utlook. M IT I succeeded \nin changing the oil tax from a value-based to a volume- \nbased tax to recover the revenue lost by the yen’s ap \xad\npreciation and lower oil prices. In exchange for higher \ntaxes, the oil industry successfully dem anded the \nremoval o f support for research and developm ent of \nalternative energies from the oil tax special account in the \nbudget plan for 1988.\nPROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE\nSeveral characteristics of Japanese energy policy can \nbe identified.\nFirst, energy policy is marked by a tendency to \nseparate technical and political goals. Jap an ’s adminis1\n■‘Natural Resource arid Energy Agency, op. cit., pp. 50-54.\nHIkenberry, op. tit., p. 107.\n^Interviews with officials of MITI, Ministry of Finance and \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, conducted in December, 1987.\ntrative-technological response to the energy crises \nfaithfully followed the three goals adopted by the U nited \nStates-led International Energy Agency in 1974: diversi\xad\nfication of oil sources away from the M iddle East; diver\xad\nsification away from oil to other types of energy; and \nconservation measures to lower absolute levels of energy \nconsum ption.14 Jap an ’s political-diplomatic response \nwas a  shift to a  pro-Arab posture and the prom otion of \nfriendly relations with oil-producing countries while \nm aintaining good relations with the U nited States —a \npolicy that required delicate balancing. T his \ndichotomous approach derives from the dependency of \nthe Japanese economy on M iddle East oil and on the \nU nited States m arket.\nSecond, the Japanese approach has been basically \ndefensive and emphasizes bilateral diplomatic efforts \nrather than m ultilateral strategy. By resorting to a pro- \nA rab “resource diplomacy,” Jap an  sought to develop \nm utually dependent friendly relations with individual \noil-producing countries. T his contrasts with the ag\xad\ngressive and confrontational approach of the U nited \nStates.\nT hird , again in contrast to the U nited States emphasis \non geopolitical considerations, Japanese energy strategy \nhas been dom inated by economic concerns and perspec\xad\ntives. This difference may be explained partly by the \ndifference in self-conception of the U nited States as a \nguardian of the free world and Jap an  as a vulnerable \nm erchant state. Japanese policy assumes that economic \ninterdependence would be the best insurance against a \nhostile embargo. Although religious and ideological fac\xad\ntors are of critical im portance in understanding the \nvolatility of politics in the M iddle East, underlying eco\xad\nnomic forces are seen as more im portant. T he majority \nopinion am ong M IT I officials is that oil cut-offs will not \nlast long and can be met by oil stockpiles without causing \ncatastrophic confusion.15 Since the early 1960’s, Ja p a n \xad\nese policy has been characterized by a rather nonchalant \nattitude toward energy security. This attitude may have \nits roots in the prevailing Japanese concept of national \nsecurity— defense based on the U nited States security \numbrella.\nFourth, in terms of means, Japanese energy policy has \ncontinuously emphasized industrial competitiveness as a \ncritical element in achieving a variety of goals, ranging \nfrom energy security to the introduction and develop\xad\nm ent of alternative energy sources. Until the 1973 oil \ncrisis, the cost factor — securing cheap energy — had been \na greater concern for Jap an ’s policymakers and industry, \nparticularly the energy-intensive industries, than energy \nsecurity.\nFifth, a  related characteristic of Ja p a n ’s energy policy \nhas been its reliance on the m arket as the final determ i\xad\nnant of the country’s energy supply-dem and structure. \nT he  Japanese energy program  has been designed basic\xad\nally to foster the developm ent of competitive energy \nsources that would in turn foster the growth of a com-\n', '184 •  CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1988\npelilive economy through the m axim um  utilization of \nm arket forces. Environm ental problems have been \nhandled within this framework. If interest-group pres\xad\nsure forced the adoption of policies that distorted the \nm arket, the governm ent usually reintervened to correct \nm arket imperfections in support of m arket forces.\nT he two energy crises have given the governm ent op\xad\nportunities to create and expand institutions for m anag\xad\ning the energy situation. Yet nationalization of the \nenergy industry has never become an issue; the basic rule \nhas been to let the m arket m anage the m atter, including \nthe security of energy supplies.\nAs previously m entioned, during the period of high \neconomic growth Japan created an energy intensive in \ndustrial structure, which required constantly growing \nexports to pay for im ported oil and other resources. As a \nresult, the governm ent bureaucracy created a maze of \nbudgetary, financial and fiscal institutions to strengthen \nthe competitiveness of prom ising export industries as \nwell as to smooth the adjustm ent problems and resistance \nof the declining industries.\nT he oil-based economic growth contributed to the \nconcentration of population in the narrow Pacific coastal \nbelt. D uring the high economic growth period, massive \nmetropolitan concentration occurred without proper city \nplanning or public facilities, creating a poor living en\xad\nvironment and overpriced residential land. The prevail\xad\ning Japanese life-style, described by Europeans as “a \nworkaholic living in a rabbit hutch,” is rooted in this pat\xad\ntern o f urbanization and, to a significant degree, so is \nJap an ’s persistent trade surplus.\nRising land and housing prices have compelled the j a -  \npanese to work harder and save more than their W estern \ncounterparts: governm ent financial and tax measures \nhelped turn the savings into capital investment, par\xad\nticularly in targeted export industries. T he first oil crisis \nignited this export-fueled system and caused huge im \xad\nbalances and bitter frictions in the world economy. \nJap an ’s energy policy played a critical role in the process.\nT he second oil crisis and the yen’s appreciation, how\xad\never, created an environm ent that has eroded the foun\xad\ndation of the export-fueled system. T he structural \nchange from energy-intensive heavy industry to the tech\xad\nnology-intensive m anufacturing and service industries as \nthe main industrial base of the country has been in pro\xad\ngress since the late 1970’s, but was accelerated recently \nby the yen’s appreciation.\nJap an ’s political institutions, functioning in a web of \neconomic interests and social obligations, have com \xad\nbined with Ja p a n ’s consensus decision-making system to \nact as a formidable force against change. As the history of \nJa p a n ’s energy policy reveals, in many cases vested in\xad\nterests blocked or slowed reforms advocated by the gov\xad\nernm ent. W hen change took place, it was not political \nleadership but market forces —domestic and interna\xad\ntional—that eventually prevailed over opposition. In \nsome cases, gaiatsu or foreign pressure, concurrent with\ninternational market forces, played an im portant role in \nJapanese policy.\nIt rem ains to be seen how the proclaimed goal of struc\xad\ntural change can be im plemented and whether the pol\xad\nicy-making pattern can be changed by political leader\xad\nship or a crisis situation. But it is likely that the globaliza\xad\ntion of the Japanese economy will push Japanese policy- \nm akers—public and private—into a new arena of polit\xad\nical decision-making, and force them to formulate pol\xad\nicies based on a broader view of hum an needs than the \ninterests of their client industries or constituencies.\nIn spite of M IT I’s image as the guardian of business \ninterests and the opponent o f environm ental protection, \nthere has been a steady current within M IT I in support \nof the development o f new energy sources and local \nenergy systems based on solar and small-scale \nhydropow er generation. Policy in this direction would \ncom plem ent the dispersion o f population and industry \nfrom metropolitan centers, a plan that has also been on \nthe political agenda. M ore generally, when the Japanese \neconomy becomes m ore self-sufficient in energy, the \nneed to export goods will decrease. T here is a real \npossibility tha: international inlluencc can help generate \ndomestic pressure in support of Ja p a n ’s official goals of \nexpanding energy sources and domestic dem and. ■\nUNITED STATES-JAPANESE \nRELATIONS\n(Continuedfrom page 152)\nof booster rockets, and plans to launch an unm anned \nspace shuttle and to make m ajor contributions to an in\xad\nternational space station. However, these capabilities \nneed not be deployed by a governm ent at odds with the \nU nited States, but can be developed within the U nited \nStatcs-Japanese security relationship.\nCULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS\nStudents of Jap an  are aware that there is a special \nsense of Japanese “cxccptionalism” in Jap an .
