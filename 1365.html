Mr. Bryan was\nIn excellent spirits when lie left here\nat 8:20 a.m. He said ho was Immensely\npleased with Thursday\'s demonstra\ntions. Ho Invited Charles N. Bulger\nof Oswego to remain with him to the\nend of the trip and Mr. Bulger accept\ned. Mr. Bryan\'s first stop of the day\nwas at Solway, a suburb of Syracuse,\nwhere ho made a short speech at the\nrailroad station.\nA large ciowcr greeted Mr. Bryan at\nSoward Park, Auburn, where he de\nvoted most of his time to the trusts.\nA printed statement credited to E. D.\nMetcalf, superintendent of D. M. Os\nborne & Co., to the effect that in case\nMr. Bryan was elected, the Osborne\nshops, one of the largest manufacturer\nof agricultural Implements of the\ncountry would be closed, received Mr.\nBryan\'s attention. He declared Mr.\nMetcalf\'s announcement was intended\nto coerce voters. Pointing to a statue\nof William H Seward, Mr. Bryan\nsaid: "There stands a statue of the\ngreatest man your city ever produced,\nuntil Mr. Metcalf arose. There tha\nfinger points upwards and inscribed\non the base is Seward\'s famous words,\n\'There is a higher law.\' When our\nfriend, Colonel Metcalf, is called to h!s\nfathers I suggest you have a statue\nerected and have his fingers pointing\ndownward and be inscribed \'There is\na lower law.\' "\nLater on In his speech Mr. Bryan\nreverted to Mr. Metcalf and his insti\ntution, saying: "This firm in your city\nthreatens to close its factory. That is\nan old trick. They made the same\nthreat in 189G, and yet after the elec\ntion many that had threatened to\nclose the mills if. I was elected cut\ndown wages and made their man suf\nfer after Mr. McKiuley was elected.\nIf it is right for this company to co\nerce its employes, it must be on tho\ntheory that a man who stands at the\nhead of a corporation has a right to\ntho votes of its employes, and if so,\nthen let u have a law enabling Mr.\nMetcalf to vote as many times as he\nhas employes, so that none of the em\nployes will get away from him. But\nif the voto belongs to the citizen, then\nlot us have a law that will make it a\npenitentiary offense for a man to try\nto rob another man of his citizenship\nbecause he works for him. I want\nyou who labor to understand that\nwhen you work you give to the man\nwho employes you full recompense\nfor what ho pays you, for if you did\nnot ho w.ould not employ you. They\ngo on the theory that a man who\nworks for another man ought to be\nunder great obligations for a job. Why.\nmy friends, Mr. Metcalf would not em\nploy ono single man if that man could\nnot mako enough to make his own\nwages and, something besides for Mr.\nMetcalf to pay him for employing him.\nThen it yoii give a full return for all\nthat you get, why should you not have\nyour citizenship as your own, and why\ndon\'t you resent this damnable Insult\nthat Is becoming top common in Amer\nican politics?"\nMr. Bryan also quoted an extract\nfrom a local Republican paper, telling\nof a farm which had be,en spld for\n$6.50 an acre, while It had been as\nsessed for taxes at $16 an acre. Com\nmenting upon this extract, Mr. Bryan\nsaid, derisively: "Farnjers now voto\nto keep present conditions. They arc\nso satlstactpry that you can not sell\nyour land for half what It is assessed\nfor for taes. Go out and find what\nper cent of taxation Is levied uppn\nyour railroads. Go out and find what\npor cent of taxation is levied on your\nlarge factories, and see if they aro as\nsessed for more than twice what they\nwill sell for at public auction. If these\nconditions are satisfactory, let every\none who bellovcs it voto tho Repub\nlican ticket, because all Republicans\ntell you they will maintain present\nconditions."\nAt Ithaca Mr. Bryan was given u\nhearty welcome. When he appeared\non tho speaker\'s stand ho was met by\na solid mass of students from Cornell\nuniversity, who greeted him with tho\ncollege yell. The speaking took place\nin front of tho High School building.\nJudge Bulger was tho first speaker,\nand while ho was talking glrlB In tho\nHigh School. building window Imme\ndiately over tho speaker\'s- stand low\nered a picture of President McKlnloy.\n\'After tho picture hung out for per\nhaps\' Ave\' minutes tho, young women\nwere prevailed upon to remove it\nMr. Bryan spoke an hour and was\nfrequently Interrupted by shouts In tho\noutskirts of the crowd. Mr. Bryan\nmet them with the intimation that It\nwas an effort to prevent freo speech.\nAfter this the Interruptions took tho\nshape of questions as to tho disposi\ntion of tho Philippines, to remedies\nfor the trusts, to tho race question in\nthe south, to tho ice trust and to tho\nfree coinage of silver. Replying to\nthis last question, Mr. Bryan said he\nstood now where Piesident McKlnley\nhad formerly stood on that question,\nand that his (Mr. Bryan\'s) position on\nthat and all other questions was ex\nplained by the Kansas City platform.\nWhilo Mr. Bryan was talking, an\nother picture of the president was\nhung out frpm a window.. This boro\nIhe inscription: "McKlnley was vlghL"\nTho appearance of tho poster called\nforth renewed shouts both of derision\nand of approval, but Mr. Bryan said\nthat he had no objection to the poster\n"I only want you to ask yourselves,"\nhe said, "when McKlnley was right,\nfor he has been on both sides of every\nquestion that has ever come to the\nfront." With this sally the poster wa3\nallowed to drop, and It floated out over\ntho crowd. When Mr. Bryan closed\nho was roundl" hoorpd.\nHan ii. ui\'imlcn.\nNorfolk, Neb., Oct. 19. South and\neast through the eastern tier of coun\nties in Nebraska, with one stop at\nSioux City, 15 stops altogether, was\nthe program mapped out tor Senator\nHanna and Frye Friday. The Itiner\nary included speeches at SLux City,\nla., Wakefield, Wayne, Wlnslde, Hos\nklns and Norfolk, Neb., transferring\nat that point to the Union Pacific.\nStop3 were made at Madison, Senator\nAllen\'s home, Humphrey, Platte Cen\nter, Columbus, Schuyler, North Bend,\nFremont, Wahoo and an evening meet\ning at the home of W. J. Bryan, Lin\ncoln, where the train stopped over\nnight Saturday\'s program, the last\nday of Senator Hanna\'s trip through\nthe west, Includes but eight speeches,\nbut at all of these stops Senators Han\nna and Frye will speak at some length.\nSaturday\'s speechmaking will begin at\nWymore, thence to Pawneo City, Hum\nboldt, Falls City, Auburn, Nebraska\nCity and Weeping Water, with the\nculminating meeting of the week\ncampaigning at Omaha in the evening.\nA big audience greeted Mr. Hanna at\nNorfolk, tho street being packed for\nalmost a block from the speaking\nstand erected a short distance up from\nthe railroad station. "I have heard\nthat you have a candidate for the\npresidency living in your state," said\nMr. Hanna amid laughter, "and that\nhe has got it bad, so bad that he is\nwilling to sacrifice all the material In\nterests of this country in order that\nhe may attain tho height of his am\nbition. Now my friends you aro not\ncalled upon to exercise the preroga\ntive of your votes to satisfy the, ambi\ntion of any man, but you aro called\nupon to consider your own Interests,\nthe Interests of your families, tho in\nterests of your countrymen and your\ncountry first." In briefly discuss\ning tho issue of "imperialism" Mr.\nHanna said: "There is another side to\nthis question, that of patriotism. As\nlong as our dead lie burled in the\nPhilippines, husbands, brothers of\nyour own lie In that soil, and any man\nwho attempts to haul down that em\nblem of liberty and protection will be\nsnowed under. They say thero is an\nother side to this question, one of sor\ndid greed; they call It commercialism.\nWe.ll, ray friends, if It is commercial\nism to want the possession of a\n\'strategip point giving tho American\npeople an opportunity to maintain a\n.foothold, in the markets of that great\neastern country, for God\'s sake let us\nhave commercialism." A half hour\'s\nstop was made at Madison, Senator\nAllen\'s Home. Senator Hanna spoke\nbriefly, urging the voters, o? Nebraska\nto forget past\' party affiliations and to\nremember that present conditions un\nder tho Republican administration are\nof unprecedented prosperity.\nKoosevelt\'B Itoundups.\nHuntington, W. Va,, Oct. 19. Gov\nernor Roosevelt left Parkcrsburg over\ntho Ohio River railway a,t 8 a. m. on a\nspecial train. Thero was a big crowd\nat the depot to see him off. He made\nBhort speeches all along the lino en\nroute to Huntington, where he spoke\nIn tho afternoon. Tho demonstration\nhere was tho largest ever seen in this\ncity. During the afternoon Governor\nRoosevelt made stops at Hurricane,\nCharleston and Hlnton.\nStevenson nf Utlen.\nUtlca, N. Y., Oct. 19. Adlal B. Stev\nenson arrived here from Lowvllle,\nwhere he spoke Thursday night. Ho\nexpressed himself as highly gratified\nwith the meeting there. Mr, Steven\nson went at onco to his hotel. His\nrooms were crowded during tho after\nnoon w,lth callers.\nIS NOT YEnETTLEB.\nfan S. Coin,e to an Acrcomont on tlii\'\nPowder PionoMiion,\nSTRIKE A1AY HANQ ON SOME TIAIE.\nOperators Want to Figure tho De\ncre.isa on Price of Powder Into\nTlie lnureuse oi W\'ajjes i\'i evi\ndent .Mitchell lteilceut.\nHazkton, Oct. 19. Final settlement\nof tho strike is undoubtedly blocked\nby the question as to the price mineis\nwill be asked to pay for powder. E.n\nployeis have agieed to pay 10 per com\nmore In wages than they weie beAnt:\nthe strike, but insist that the i eduction\n\'of $1.23 a keg in the price of powdm\nshall be taken Into consideration. Tho\nminers appaiently want to go back to\nwork for the 10 per cent advance, then\narbitrate the question whether they\nare to get powder cheaper as an ad\nditional condition. It Is not believed\nthe mine owners will grant any such\ndemand and their refusal may mean\nthe Indefinite piolongatlon of strike.\nSince the Philadelphia confeience of\nrailroad opeiators and ofilclals Piesi\ndent Mitchell has become very teti\ncent, maintaining an absolute silence\non the powder question. Wnen he\nwas asked whether another conven\ntion will be called to ascertain the\nwishes of the men on the newest com\nplication he replied, "I prefer not to\nanswer that." When ho was asked\nwhat the prospects were for an early\nending of the strike he said, "No man\nIn America is desirous or more anxious\nto end this contest than myself and I\nhave done all in my power to briLg\nabout an honorable settlement."\nThis non-committal answer helps to\nstrengthen tho Impression that the\nlabor war Is not so near a solution as\nit was thought to have been. The\nspirit of jubilation that prevailed in\nthis region Wednesday has given way\nto a feeling of disappointment.\nMAUCIIKD ON JKDDO.\nStrikers Successfully Plan and\nKx.\necu id vii Kxpeuttlon.\nHazleton, Pa., Oct 19. About 800\nstrikers made a descent on the No.\nfour Jeddo mines of G. B.

Eacl; local union marched\nindependently to a point on. the Jqddo\nroad, near Oakdale. Tlq South Slders\nreached their destination at 5 a. in.\nand those from the other side arrived\nsoon afterward. A signal of thiee pis\ntol shots was fired by one side and an\nswered by tho other. Then the two\nbodies arrived and met in front of the\nbreaker in Oakdale. There was a fpreo\nof deputy sheriffs on duty, but they\nwere kept In tho background. Tho\nsheriff himself did not arrive until the\naffair was nearly over.\nAs soon as John Markle, managing\npartner of the firm, heard of\nthe march he went to Oakdale and ex\npostulated with the strikers urging\nthem to disperse. They, however, re\nmained, In tho vicinity of OaHdalQ,\nmarching up and down the road until\n7:30 o\'clock, when they went home.\nNo one was seriously hurt, but one\nman going to work was set upon by\nstrikers and beaten and others, were\nmenaced. The strikers claim they\nshut up the colliery, but at the Markle\noffice it was stated the mine is still\nworking.\nPreparing to, Kesumc.\nShamokln, Pa., Oct 19. Prepara\ntions are being made by the Philadel\nphia and Reading Coal and Iron com\npany tho Mineral Railroad and Min\ning company and the Union Coal com\npany for an early resumption of. work\nat their respective collieries. En\ngineers and firemen have been ordered\nInto the mines to repair pumps and\nengines, and mules aro being brought\nback. Among the strikers some dis\nappointment Is expressed that no word\nhas come from President Mitchell in\nreference to a settlement of tho strike,\nbut thero appears to be no break In\ntheir ranks. They say they would not\nthink of returning to work unless an\norder declaring tho strike off Is Issued\nby Mitchell, Tho statement Is also\nmado that they ara more prepared than\nmost people Imagine to remain out six\nmonths longer If necessary.\nYouiiir iicendiary.\nNew Philadelphia, O., Oct. 19.

That Youtsey is to all in\ntents and purposes of this trial a dead\nman. He said Youtsey had a right to\ndefend the executive building if it had\nbeen attacked and his having a gun\nJan. 27 was not suspicious because\nevery other man in that buldlng was\narmed at that time.

The state depart\nment has decided not to make public\nthe text of these supplementary in\nstructions, but it may be stated that\nour government does not regard the\nChinese tender as sufficient to meet\nthe necessities of the case.

Cry Senator\nAllen Pins \'Km Bonn.\nIn tho State Senate Wednetday Sena\ntor Allen of Fayette County delivered a\napeech that fortver seta at rest the ques\ntion aa lo the responsibility for the fail\nure to enact a new election law to take\nthe place of the Goebel law. The speak\ner, in language that can not be mistaken,\nexposed tho hypo\'ciisy of the Republicans\nin trying to elnfc tho blame from their\no.vn shoulders to that of the Democrats.\nMr. Allen\'s apeech waa in reply to some\nremarks made by Senator Kirk, a Repub\nlican leader of the Senate, who unwitting\nly boaBted that tho Republicans had con\ntrolled the Senate from the time it had\nassembled. Mr. Allen says: \'\nI tun indeed thnnkful to tho Senator from\nJolinsou for ono tiling ho has itoito by the speech j\nho has Just mndo upon this iloor, for he fcus (\nllnntly ntul eternully net nt rest u question which\nhas been a mooted one ever since this session\nbegan, namely do tho Democrats or Republi\ncans control tills Senate. It lias been asserted\nby tho Republican press nud speakers ol tho\nStttto ami by Republican and self-allege I Dome\ncrats of this body that tho Democrats hnvo com\nplete control of both homes of this Assembly,\nand nro therefore responsible for tl.o passage or\nuoiipa\'siige of a fair election law, but tho Senator\nfrom Johnson, as the Republican lender upon this\nfloor, has just given the lie to all such statements\nin most emphatic and uumlstakeablo terms\nwhen ho asserted and reiterated that th ! Repub\nlicans iiuil their "honorable" Democratic allies\n(-.oven in uumucr whom he enumerated by\nname) nr had comphlcciilrol of litis senate from the\nbeginning. Ho even goes so far as to say thny\ncould have taken tho majority ou the SulVragc\nand Election Committee which was formed nt\nthe commencement of this i-esslon, but they\ngave" tho majority to tho Democrats as a kind\nof courtesy.\nThus, Mr. President, we nt last hove nu ac\nknowledgement from them of -that which wo\nhave always known nud which they have always\ndenied. 1 liavo no disposition to impugn or crit\nicise the motives of these seven "houorablc Dem\nocrats" possibly they are tho only ones here\nbut 1 do love for tho truth to be known, nud I do\nkuow that theMj seven gentlemen have never\nallliliutcd with us; they have not attended our\nconferences except to stay a moment and walk\nout: they have not attended our family louucils,\nnor would they accord us n decent hearing upon\nquestions in outer that wo might make mutual.\nc n cessions nud get together upon common\nground wln.ro all true Democrats could stand.\nThey would not even como Into our camp long\nenough to Hud out whether wo were honest and\nblncere or not, but ctnl immediately into tfic Jlejntb\nlican camp at the beginning of this session and liare\nbeen there ever since, nud wo nro now informed In\nthe language of the Senator who has just taken\nhis seat that "they have stood side by tide tetth the\nthirteen Republicans of thts house ujon aery pwjosl\nHon since the beginning of this session."\nThe Senator from Johnson then proceeded to\ncharge the Democrats of this bouse with every\nspecies of insincerity and with doing everything\nIn their power to obstruct the passage of a fair\nand honest law. In answering him I shall not\ndeal in generalities end promiscuous charges as\nhu did, but will brleily review tho record of our\nproceedings and state the recorded truth.\nWhen the discussion first began they said thoy\nw in ted tho State Board of Election Commission\neis to have only ministerial functions with no\np wer to try contests, etc. This poiut wo promptly\nyielded. Next you said you did not want tho\nState Hoard elected by the Legislature, but want\ned the board appointed by the Governor, one\nmember from each of tho two political parties\nnud a state officer for third member. This point\nwo readily conceded, and Mr. Utlcy, a Democrat,\nunved an amendment to that effect, and it\nu is unanimously adopted by the Senate. Sena\ntor Harrel, ono of tho "houorable" Democrats,\nthen rose and said ho was glad to see the spirit\nof fairness and concession on our part, and If we\nwould persevere in that spirit you would do like\nwise aud we would have no trouble making a\nfair law. Wo did continue In that spirit of con\ncession, and as long as wo were making nil tho\n\' P.inp0filnii4 0V..rvthlfiiT u-ptif wall lint wlipn irn\nasked you to do likewise tho spirit of fairness\nand concession, which you had talked of fo\nmuch, vanished entirely, and to this good hour\nyou have never yielded an Inch.\nThis became apparent when tho qucstiou camo\nup as to which State officer should bo umpire of\ntho State Board. The Democrat\') wanted tho\nClerk of the Court of Appeals, but you said no;\nthat you did not propose for Sara Shacklcford to\nbo dictator of Kentucky polltlcs,o by a vote of\n\'JO to tS you struck out the Clerk of the Court of\nAppeals, nn officer who was elected by tho un\ndisputed majority of 17,000 votes, aud substituted\ntho Attorney General, nn officer whom jou and\nall your speakers and all jour niwpnpcrs have\nproclaimed from one end of Kentucky to the\nother to be an Impjstef, holding an cilice which\nho stole from another ban. ThU Is but a sample\nof your cuotemptiblonypoorUy aud iiHuccrity.\nllut wo wout fnrthr. When we oimo to tho\nCounty Boards you snld you wnuted the right to\nnamo your own member on each County Board,\nnud wo ngrecd to that. You then tald you\nwanted the County Boards to have only minis\nterial powers, and wo agreed to that. Thus you\nwere given your oWn election officers to repre\nsent you nud count your votes at tho polls, aud\nthe electlou boards were stripped of all power\nto throw out your votes after they wero counted,\nand mil you rhargo that wo nro not willing to\ngive you n fair law. At the last session, Mr.\nI\'reslilet.t, I introduced nn ameudtnent to the\nolectiou law, tho only provislou of which was to\nallow each political party tho right to name Its\nown elrctlon officers, and in that way to say who\nshoul.il represent them nt the polls. Col. Brccfc\nliuldfw, of Lexington, who has probably snld\naud wntteu moro In condemnation of tho Goe\nbel Kw than any other man in Kentucky, aud\nwho Is regarded as high authority by all who op\nI poso tho Qocbol law, tald editorially of the abovo\nnxenument mat "it uvued not only be an impwvt\nmtnt on the Gocbcl lair, but uvuld be a list improve\nment upon theoldlawatti Hood before the Goebel laic\nteas enacted."\nTho same writer la his editorial i few days ago\nsaid tho gist of a fair election law would be one\nComparisons nr upfnt. Tho fit, stylo and\nquality of our CLOTHING with that bought else\nwncro. It will result In much saving of money\nf t you and we\'ll secure your custom. Our fail\nline Is about ompletonnd wo direct special at\ntention to our Overcoats ut Sl\'2 and our Suits at\n$12 CO.\nwhich allowed each party to nnmo its own pre\ncinct election officers nud give the election\nboards only ministerial powers. Jloth of these\nprortslon hare long since been agreed lo by ciery Dem\nocrat In this General Assembly, nnd If the Republi-1\ncaus had been half nsnnxloiM for a Inw as you\nprcteud you could have had one which cm\nbraced the "gist" of a fair law long ago. They\ncould have had one which wns not only better\nthnn the Goebel law, but one which was "n vast\nimprovement upon the old law." Did you ac"\ncept that law? No; you stood pat and said\'\n"Wo propose to dictate every lino of lino of the\nlaw to suit ourselves, or wo won\'t have anything\nntall."\nHut tho Democrats went further. Wo mndo\nc mcctblou after concession until the only ma\nterial did ere 11 co betweeti us was the manner of\ndetermining who should bo the umpire or third\nmember of tho County Boards. You said you\nwanted tho Sheriff or .some county officer to be\nthe umpire. We opposed this nnd told you our\nreason, namely, that It would give tho Republi\ncans nbsoluto control of the mountains.\nAs n final resort, as a final concetslon, I ofTered\nnu amendment which I hoped nud believed\nwould meet tho approval of tho majority ol both\nHouses. It was to the ellect that tho State\nlizard should divide tho umpires between the\ntwo parties so that In each Congressional district\nof tho State eni\'h party would huve the umpire\non as nearly one-half as possible of the County\nBoards of tho counties of Iho district. To the\nbest of my ability I uudertook to show tho\nmerits of the plan. I argued that It wns the fair\nest manner 1 could conceive of in which to di\nvide the county umpires and, furthermore, that\nit distributed tho Influence of the two parties\nthroughout the State, and did not leave either\nparty In absolute control of any section of the\nS ate.\nIt never occurred to mo that any Republican\nWould vote against the proposition, aud I was\nonly afraid that if it passed the Senate simply\nby the Republican vote it would bo doubtful\nabout passing it through tho House. So 1 had\nsecured the pledge of a number of Democrats to\nvote for it aua hoped in that way to give the\namendment an influence that would pass It in\ntho House. Senators Alexander aud Hays both\ncamo and told me they thought It a fair proposi\ntion, and the Senator from Johnson came aud\ntold me the samo thing. The amendment was\nput upon its passage, the Democrats voted for It\naccording to promise, ns did Senators Alexander,\nHays, McConnell and Harrell; but tho Senator\nfrom Jobnsou sat in his scat nud did not voto\nwhen bis name was called. I kept tab on the\nvoto and saw that the amendment had carried\nby a small margin, aud, Mr. President, In that\nbrief moment I thought I saw tho promised land\nI believed the solution of our troubles bad been\nfound, for Democrats nnd Republicans aliko bad\njoined In passing that amendmcut\'whlch remov\ncd the final poiut of contention. Rut, sir, in that\ncrucial hour, when it seemed to me so much was\nat stake, Me Senator from Johnson rose In his place\nbefore the vote ivas announced and voted against the\namendment. Following his laid Senator Dye IRep.)\nanil Harrell, who had voted for the amendment.\nchanged their totes from yea to nay, and defeated the\namendment by tiro voles. Mr. President, tho Gover\nnor call us heroin good faith. His purposes\nwero unselfish ; had ho wished ho could have\ntested upon the law as it stood. It was a matter\nentirely with him. Rather than take any advan\ntagc he might have had under the Goebel law ho\ncalled us hero that his opponent might be given\nan absolutely even chauco In the coming olec\ntlon. When he called us hero his duty ended\nHo could do no more.\nI X0WC1IAU0E WITHOUT RESERVATION THAT TIIF\nRCI\'l\'DLlCAN MEMBERS OF THIS I10DY HAVE TAKEN A\nCRUEL AND A COWARDLY ADVANTAGE OF HIS OEN\nEnOBITY.

Vol.32, !Mge3273J\nThe President, in his Boston speech\nyesterday, maks this extraordinary\nstatement: \'The Philippiues,like Cuba\nand Porto Rico, were intiusted into our\nhands by war."\nOn tho contrary, the protocol Bigned as\nthe result of the war provided for the\nPhilippines, not "liko Cuba and Porto\nRico," but expressly reserved them for\nnegotiation with Spain as to their \'\'future\ncontrol, disposition and government."\nThe Philippines have been "intrusted"\nto us solely by the unexpected demand\nfor them made by the Pr. sident hirm-elf\nafter he had suddenly changed his mind\nwhich .was at first that we should not\nburden ourselves with them.\nThe Senate asked him 10 lay before it\nhis instructions or correspondence with\nthe Commissioners, which would have\nproved this, but he. refused.\nThe Philippine burden is not charge\nable to tho war. This is the President\'s\nown Pandora box, his Now Year\'s gift to\nthis country, for which he alone is re\nsponsible. Neither Congres3 or the peo\nple had any voice in the matter. But\none need not wonder why he should now\nattempt tojwadc the responsibility, since\nhe tells us "that every red drop, whether\nfrom the veiuB of an American soldier or\na misguided Filipino, 1b anguish to my\nheart." His conscience smiles hira. No\nwonder. The guilty Macbeth also cried\nout, "Thou canst not say I did it."\n"Whether the acquisition of the Phil\nippines was wife or foolish, they are\nare upon our hands, not by the war, but\nby the President\'s own act, and ho should\nstand up like a man and assume the re\nsponsibility, asking yis countrymen to\nforgive his mistake, if he now sees he\nhas made one.
