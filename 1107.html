In \n2016, sixty-three percent of Americans polled said that “torture against \nsuspected terrorists to obtain information about terrorist activities” could be \njustified often or sometimes.1 Given this statistic, what are the vulnerabilities \nwithin the current prohibition that makes a return to an official torture policy \npossible? How likely is a return to officially sanctioned torture by the United \nStates (U.S.)? This article shows that a return to an official torture policy is \npossible and even likely, at least in part. Despite the steps the government has \ntaken to prevent future abuses, the current makeup of the government, the \njudicial precedents, and the country’s relative safety from terrorism, there are \nstill gaping holes in the ban on torture.  \n \nThis article provides background information on the history of American \npost-September 11 torture policy and practice and its eventual dismantling, as \nwell as evidence that torture is ineffective and illegal. It then shows the \navenues for a return to an official torture policy, examining the options for \nand likelihood of actions through each branch of American government. If a \npresident sought to reinstate a torture regime, could he or she accomplish this \ngoal through executive powers, the legislature, and/or the judiciary? The \narticle also examines other factors, including the importance and malleability \nof public opinion on the issue, as well as the institutions a president would \ntask with carrying out torture (the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. \nmilitary). Finally, the article addresses arguments that an official torture \npolicy is improbable. \n \nThough several commentators have written articles speculating whether \nPresident Trump will revive a torture policy, none have examined the issue at \nthe level of detail in this article. The debate over the reinstatement of an \nofficial torture policy could have significant and lasting effects on U.S. \nnational security policy and counterterrorism operations, and this article \nseeks to influence this debate and future policy decisions on the issue. \n \n                                                          \n1 Ipsos, “Ipsos Poll Conducted for Reuters, Brussels Topline 3.28.2016,” Ipsos Public \nAffairs, March 28, 2016, available at: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/16/IpsosBrussels.pdf.\nJacobson: Could the United States Reinstitute an Official Torture Policy?\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '98 \nBackground \nPost-9/11 Torture \nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contracted \npsychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen to design an interrogation \nprogram based on techniques used in the U.S. military’s Survival, Evasion, \nResistance, and Escape (SERE) program. To prepare U.S. military personnel \nwho served in roles with a high probability of capture, SERE exposed them to \nharsh interrogation techniques to teach them resistance strategies. Mitchell \nand Jessen designed the Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs) program \nto induce a state of learned helplessness in detainees, which the psychologists \ntheorized would coerce detainees into divulging valuable information.2 In \ninterrogations of terrorism suspects the CIA, the U.S. military, and these \nagencies’ contractors used Mitchell and Jessen’s program, and other torture \nand abusive techniques not on the approved EITs list.  \n \nBush Administration lawyers approved many of the techniques using an \ninterpretation of the international legal definitions of torture well short of the \ncommon understanding to provide legal cover for their application. The \nadministration’s lawyers also argued that during times of national emergency, \nthe president could use extraordinary measures to protect the country, \nincluding the abuse of prisoners, and that the United States was not obligated \nto provide captured terrorists Geneva Convention protection.3 The Bush \nAdministration consistently touted EITs as having produced intelligence that \nsaved lives and stopped attacks. But oversight reports from the Senate Armed \nServices Committee (which examined U.S. military abuses) and the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence (which examined CIA abuses), and \nindependent reports from non-governmental groups such as The Constitution \nProject’s Task Force on Detainee Treatment show that the administration’s \nclaims were exaggerated or entirely false.4 The claims also demonstrate that \nthe techniques used went beyond the legal bounds set by U.S. domestic and \n                                                          \n2 The Constitution Project, The Report of The Constitution Project’s Task Force on \nDetainee Treatment, 2013 (Washington, D.C.: 2013 Constitution Project, available at: \nhttp://detaineetaskforce.org/pdf/Full-Report.pdf. \n3 “A Guide to the Memos on Torture,” New York Times, available at: \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/ref/international/24MEMO-GUIDE.html?_r=0. \n4 U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in \nU.S. Custody (Washington, D.C., 2008), available at: http://www.armedservices.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Detainee-Report-Final_April-22-2009.pdf;\nU.S. \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, Committee Study of the Central Intelligence \nAgency’s Detention and Interrogation Program (Washington, D.C., 2014), available at \nhttp://www.humanrightsfirst.org/uploads/pdfs/torture/sscistudy1.pdf; The \nConstitution Project, The Report of The Constitution Project’s Task Force on Detainee \nTreatment, 2013. \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 10  No. 2\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol10/iss2/7\nDOI: http://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.10.2.1568\n', '99 \ninternational law obligations and even the permissive guidelines provided by \nBush Administration legal officials and approved by the highest levels of \ngovernment.  \n \nOn November 25, 2015, President Barack Obama signed into law the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.5 The bill contained an \namendment sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona and \nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, which solidified the ban \non coercive interrogation techniques, originally laid out in President Obama’s \nExecutive Order 13491. Obama’s order, signed on January 22, 2009, \nrestricted interrogation techniques for U.S. military and intelligence agencies \nto those listed in the Army Field Manual–the military interrogation \nguidelines, which rely on rapport-building interrogation techniques, rather \nthan coercive and abusive measures (with one important exception detailed \nbelow). The order also established the High Value Detainee Interrogation \nGroup, made up of interrogators from across governmental agencies, tasked \nwith conducting high-level interrogations and researching effective \ninterrogation.6 A reaction to the Bush Administration’s detainee abuses, the \nexecutive order was controversial, garnering criticism that making U.S. \ninterrogation tactics public would allow terrorists to be able to elude their \nquestioners when captured.7 Supporters of the order also feared that its form \nmakes it vulnerable to easy overturning by a future president.8  \n \nFollowing the 2014 release of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s \nfindings and conclusions, and executive summary of its report on CIA abuses, \nthe McCain-Feinstein amendment addressed this latter concern, codifying \nObama’s restrictions into law. It also addressed another sore spot for \nsupporters of the executive order–which the Army Field Manual includes an \n                                                          \n5 Barack Obama, “Statement by the President,” The White House, Washington D.C., \nNovember 25, 2015, available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-pressoffice/2015/11/25/statement-president.\n6 Peter Aldhous, “Here’s What Actually Gets Terrorists to Tell the Truth–And It’s Not \nTorture,” Buzzfeed News, August 16, 2015, available at: \nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/torture-doesntwork?utm_term=.xiZa79YDV#.tdr62ZkK0.\n7 Adam Serwer, “Ayotte’s Torture Amendment is Kaput,” Mother Jones, December 1, \n2011, available at: http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/12/ayottes-tortureamendment-kaput.\n8 Physicians for Human Rights, “PHR Praises President Obama’s Executive Orders \nEnding Illegal US Detention and Interrogation Program; Accountability for Perpetrators \nof Torture Still Needed,” January 22, 2009, available at: \nhttp://physiciansforhumanrights.org/press/press-releases/news-2009-01-22.html; \nAllen Keller, “May I Have the Waterboard Please…,” Huffington Post, February 25, 2013, \navailable at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-keller/may-i-have-thewaterboard_b_2750744.html.\nJacobson: Could the United States Reinstitute an Official Torture Policy?\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '100 \nappendix (Appendix M) allowing tactics that can constitute abuse or torture \n(especially if used in concert or for extended periods) such as solitary \nconfinement, sensory deprivation, and sleep deprivation.9 The Obama \nAdministration stated that it did not intend for interrogators to use these \ntactics in a way that would constitute torture and that safeguards existed to \nprevent abuse.10 However, anti-torture advocates (including the United \nNations Committee on Torture) raised concerns that Appendix M left the door \nopen to torture and called for eliminating the section.11 McCain’s and \nFeinstein’s amendment mandates the review of the manual (including \nAppendix M), intending to limit or eliminate any potential abuse it allowed. 12 \nThe amendment’s passage reinforced the illegality of U.S. torture, along with \nany euphemistically relabeled version. \n \nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump repeatedly advocated torture during \nand after his campaign, telling audiences that he would “bring back \nwaterboarding” and “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.”13 He insisted \n                                                          \n9 Beth Van Schaak, “The Torture Convention & Appendix M of the Army Field Manual on \nInterrogations,” Just Security, December 5, 2014, available at: \nhttps://www.justsecurity.org/18043/torture-convention-appendix-army-field-manualinterrogations/.\n10 Charlie Savage, “U.N.

Past presidential candidates have similarly hedged, defending \nindividual techniques such as waterboarding, but not the concept of torture, \npreferring to adhere to the linguistic obfuscation of the Bush Administration. \nMitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, claimed that waterboarding did \nnot constitute torture, and promised, if elected, to use “enhanced \ninterrogation techniques which go beyond those that are in the military \nhandbook right now.”16 Building on these half measures, Trump has gone a \nstep further, offering a strident defense of torture outright and assurances of \nits effectiveness, potentially normalizing the practice in the minds of those \nless informed of the empirical evidence that torture is ineffective, and thus, \nmaking a return to torture more likely. \n \nTorture is Ineffective \nOutside the policy realm, while there are anecdotal examples of torture \nworking to provide intelligence, scientific evidence, expert testimony, and the \nhistorical record show that coercive interrogation is not effective in eliciting \n                                                          \nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-anchor-david-muir-speakspresident/story?id=45096081.\n14 Jenna Johnson, “Trump Says ‘Torture Works,’ Backs Waterboarding and ‘Much \nWorse,’” Washington Post, February 17, 2016, available at: \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-torture-works-backswaterboarding-and-much-worse/2016/02/17/4c9277be-d59c-11e5-b195-\n2e29a4e13425_story.html; CBS Interactive, “Donald Trump Vows to ‘Strengthen’ Laws \nto Allow Torture, Waterboarding,” CBS News, March 5, 2016, available at: \nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-vows-to-strengthen-laws-to-allowtorture-waterboarding-election-2016/;\nBen Schreckinger, “Trump Calls Geneva \nConventions ‘The Problem,’” March 30, 2016, available at: \nhttp://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-andresults/2016/03/donald-trump-geneva-conventions-221394.\n15 Alice Ollstein and Aaron Rupar, “Trump Suddenly Backpedals on Torture,” \nThinkProgress, March 4, 2016, available at: \nhttp://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/03/04/3756857/trump-torture-reversal/. \n16 “Editorial: On Torture, Romney’s Wrong,” Los Angeles Times, October 3, 2012, \navailable at: http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/03/opinion/la-ed-torture-romneyobama-20121003.\nJacobson: Could the United States Reinstitute an Official Torture Policy?\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '102 \nreliable information from prisoners.17 In 2014, a group of 25 former \ninterrogators, intelligence officers, and interviewing professionals who served \nwith U.S. military intelligence, the CIA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Naval Criminal Investigative \nService, released a statement rejecting “torture and other forms of cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment” as “illegal, ineffective, counterproductive, \nand immoral.”18 The statement continues:  \n \n“The application of psychological, emotional, and/or physical \npressure can force a victim of torture to say anything just to end \nthe painful experience....This same form of pressure will \nsubstantially impair an individual’s memory, his \npsychophysical ability to accurately recall critical details about \npeople, places, plans, or events....In cases where coercive force \nis employed in a misguided attempt to obtain an individual’s \ncompliance, that individual will, at best, only provide limited \ninformation that directly responds to the questions asked, and \nis unlikely to offer additional details or spontaneously share \ninformation outside the narrow scope of questioning. Torture \nonly guarantees pain; it never guarantees the truth.” 19 \n \nScientific research supports these assertions. Shane O’Mara, professor of \nexperimental brain research at Trinity College and author of the book Why \nTorture Doesn’t Work: The Neuroscience of Interrogation has shown that \ntorture and abusive interrogation techniques damage or negatively affect \nsections of the brain responsible for memory. He writes, “The effect of chronic \nstress on the hippocampus is hypotrophy–it causes the hippocampus to \nshrink, along with deficits in the function it supports (namely, memory).”20 \nEffective interrogations elicit as much information as possible from detainees, \nand preserving memory is essential.

Rejali writes \nthat “Once the torture session starts, it necessarily devolves into an \nunrestrained hit-or-miss affair,” adding that through the use of torture, \n“Professionals become less disciplined, more brutal, and less skilled while \ntheir organizations become more fragmented and corrupt.”22 \n \nTorture is Illegal \nTorture is also illegal, under both international law and U.S. law.

One reason this might prove difficult is the \noverwhelming support the amendment received in Congress. With powerful \nbipartisan and senior Congressional backing from McCain for the \nRepublicans and Feinstein for the Democrats, seventy-eight Senators voted in \nfavor of the amendment, with only twenty-one voting against (all \nRepublicans).26 In a time of intense partisan fissures and lack of progress on \nso many issues (causing at least one columnist to ask, “Is This the Worst \nCongress Ever?”27), this vote, on such a controversial topic no less, marks a \nsignificant moment in Congressional opposition to torture.   \n \nSimilarly, when McCain put forward the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, \nwhich barred the use of “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \npunishment” and mandated that military interrogations abide by Army Field \nManual regulations, the Senate voted ninety to nine in favor.28 A signing \nstatement from President Bush asserting the executive power to ignore the \nlimitations if he thought it would protect national security blunted the \neffectiveness of that act, but the Senate vote is still noteworthy.29   \n \nAdditionally, Congressional attempts to legislate against President Obama’s \nexecutive order have not received widespread support. In 2011, Senator Kelly \nAyotte proposed an amendment to the defense-funding bill to add a secret \nannex to the Army Field Manual, with the intention of keeping U.S. \ninterrogation tactics hidden.

There have not been any other \nsignificant legislative attempts since the executive order to overturn or \nundermine it.  \n \nHowever, since the 2016 election, there have been signs that a Congressional \nfight over interrogation policy is looming, especially given the Republican \nmajority in both houses of Congress. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR), a \nprominent member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, pushed the idea \nof a return to torture, telling Wolf Blitzer on CNN in November 2016, that \nwaterboarding is not torture and that the United States should use the tactic \non terrorism suspects. Echoing the Bush Administration legal logic used to \nauthorize torture, Cotton claimed:  \n \n“If experienced intelligence officials come to the President of the \nUnited States and say we think this terrorist has critical information \nand we need to obtain it and this is the only way we can obtain it–it's a \ntough call…Donald Trump's a pretty tough guy, and he's ready to make \nthose tough calls.”31 \n \nSenator McCain pushed back on calls to revisit torture as official policy. The \nsame month as Cotton’s CNN interview, McCain informed an audience at the \nHalifax International Security Forum, “I don’t give a damn what the president \nof the United States wants to do. We will not waterboard. We will not torture \npeople…it doesn’t work.” McCain threatened that if the any official tried to \nreinstitute a torture policy, the decision would face legal action.32 \nAdditionally, after a draft executive order leaked that suggested the Trump \nAdministration was exploring the idea of reviving torture, Republican \ncongressional leadership resoundingly voiced its opposition.33 \n \nOf the seventy-eight Senators who voted in favor of the McCain-Feinstein \namendment, all but five will remain in Congress in 2017 (depending on \n                                                          \n30 Adam Serwer, “Ayotte’s Torture Amendment is Kaput.” \n31 Christina Manduley, “Sen.

This, plus the Congressional presence of senior \nand stalwart anti-torture voices such as McCain and Feinstein makes a \nlegislative action to overturn the ban unlikely for the time being. But given the \nprecarious nature of reliance on individual Senators and the sensitivity of \nCongress to significant shifts in electorate opinion and priorities (discussed in \nmore depth below), as well as the Republican majorities in both the House \nand Senate who are more likely to agree to a policy preference of a Republican \npresident, there may be a danger to the prohibition of torture in Congress. \n \nExecutive \nWhile the current bars on torture block several avenues for Executive Branch \nactions to revive a torture policy, significant vulnerabilities still exist about \npossible executive action. A future president’s executive order overriding a \nban is one possible avenue for a return to official U.S. torture, and would \nlikely be safe from Congressional reversal. Congress could pass an additional \nbill to reinstate the ban (Congress has in the past passed bills to overturn \nexecutive orders), but if the president vetoed that new bill, it would require a \ntwo-thirds majority of Congress to override the veto, which might be difficult \nto muster.35 However, the courts could overturn an executive order that \ncontradicted an act of Congress. In 1952, the Supreme Court reversed Harry \nTruman’s order that nationalized the U.S. steel industry, and in 1995, a U.S. \nappeals court reversed Bill Clinton’s order preventing government contracts \nwith companies that replaced striking employees.36 According to the \nGovernment Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, “Courts have \nrecognized Executive Orders as having the force of law until superseded by \nlegislation or unless they are clearly in conflict with existing law.”37 In \n                                                          \n34 “U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 114th Congress-1st Session,” United States Senate, \navailable at: \nhttp://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congres\ns=114&session=1&vote=00209.  \n35 Vivian S.

A future president might attempt \nto repeat this, seeking to exploit any ambiguity in the law to out-define the \nban on torture. However, the McCain-Feinstein amendment is not vague in its \nrequirements–while it states the law does not allow torture and abusive \ninterrogation, it also limits all interrogation methods for military and \nintelligence agencies to the Army Field Manual.40 This limitation prevents the \ntype of legal wrangling done by the Bush Administration team over the \ndefinition of torture. \n \nNonetheless, adding additional techniques to the Army Field Manual is also a \nrisk. The McCain-Feinstein amendment, which restricts all national security \ninterrogations to the tactics listed in the Manual, mandates review of the \nManual every three years. This is done “to ensure [it]…complies with the legal \nobligations of the United States and reflects current evidence-based, best \npractices for interrogation that are designed to elicit reliable and voluntary \nstatements and do not involve the use or threat of force.”41 However, some \nwould likely argue that several enhanced interrogation techniques did not use \nor threaten force (sleep/sensory deprivation or temperature manipulation, for \nexample). Since there is a process in place for changing the Manual, it seems \nconceivable that tactics could be added to the Manual that would contravene \nthe intention of, but stay within the requirements of the McCain-Feinstein \namendment. The mandated review, conducted by “the Secretary of Defense, \nin coordination with the Attorney General, the Director of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, and the Director of National Intelligence” might prevent \nthese additions, especially since all of these positions require Congressional \nconfirmation (if Congress maintains its anti-torture bent).42 However, if \n                                                          \n38 Ibid. \n39 U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees.  \n40 Reaffirmation of the Prohibition on Torture, amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. \n41 Ibid. \n42 Ibid. \nJacobson: Could the United States Reinstitute an Official Torture Policy?\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '108 \ntactics are added to the Manual in a way to evade review, or if Congress \nconfirms pro-torture officials, adding abusive tactics to the Army Field \nManual could be an avenue for an official (albeit limited) torture policy. The \nTrump Administration’s draft executive order explored this option, as did CIA \nDirector Mike Pompeo during his confirmation process.43 \n \nThere is also the possibility of exploiting the questionable tactics already \nlisted in Appendix M of the Manual. As noted above, Appendix M currently \nallows the use of interrogation tactics that can constitute abuse or torture \n(especially if used in concert or for extended periods) such as solitary \nconfinement, sensory deprivation, and sleep deprivation. While the Obama \nAdministration has forsworn misusing the tactics allowed, with the \nappointment of a pro-torture Secretary of Defense and/or CIA Director, \nofficials may exploit these ambiguities.  \n \nAdditionally, if a president nominates and Congress approves individuals for \ntop positions who advocate the use of torture, or are ambivalent to its \nprohibition the debate could shift, both in the populous and in Congress, \npotentially creating enough of an impact to overturn the bars that currently \nexist. Trump’s nominees for leadership positions at the Department of \nDefense, the Department of State, the Justice Department, the Department of \nHomeland Security, and the CIA have all rejected torture and/or pledged to \nuphold the McCain-Feinstein amendment.44 Trump has also pledged to follow \nSecretary of Defense James Mattis’ recommendation to not use torture.45 \nHowever, a future president’s nominees could certainly differ in their \nopinions on the issue. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n43 Spencer Ackerman, “Trump’s Impending Executive Order Heralds ‘Dangerous’ Return \nto Torture, Officials Warn,” The Guardian, January 26, 2017, available at: \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/25/trump-executive-order-tortureblack-sites-guantanamo-bay.\n44 Caroline Kenny, “CIA Nominee Says He Would Disregard Trump on Torture,” CNN, \nJanuary 12, 2017, available at: http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/12/politics/trumpcabinet-picks-oppose-torture/;\nEditorial Board, “Trump’s Nominees” Are Right: The \nUnited States Can’t Go Backward on Torture,” Washington Post, January 13, 2017, \navailable at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trumpsnominees-are-right-the-united-states-cant-go-backward-on-\ntorture/2017/01/13/72c47cfc-d9ab-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html;  \n45 Cameron Joseph, “President Trump Says James Mattis Will ‘Override’ His Own Views \non Torture,” Daily News, January 27, 2017, available at: \nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-mattis-override-views-torturearticle-1.2957473.\nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 10  No. 2\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol10/iss2/7\nDOI: http://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.10.2.1568\n', '109 \nJudicial \nA future president could also bring a challenge in the courts, asserting \nexecutive privilege over detention and interrogation issues in an attempt to \nreverse the ban. The Bush Administration asserted this privilege repeatedly, \nsuch as in Bush’s signing statement to the Detainee Treatment Act, referenced \nabove. The Obama Administration claimed executive privilege on detention \nissues, although not nearly as expansively as the Bush Administration, and \nnot to advocate coercive interrogation techniques.46 \n \nEven so, the Supreme Court has established judicial precedent rejecting \nexecutive claims that the Geneva Conventions do not protect imprisoned \nterrorism suspects or individuals captured in armed conflicts against terrorist \nor insurgent groups. In doing so, the court rejected unbounded executive \nprivilege over the treatment of those prisoners during war. In Hamdan v. \nRumsfeld, the court decided that Common Article 3, which regulates military \nconduct toward prisoners in non-international armed conflict, covered U.S \nprisoners in the war on terror (even if not part of a regulated armed force).47 \nThis includes a prohibition on “violence to life and person, in particular \nmurder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture” and “outrages \nupon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.”48 \nPresident Bush subsequently issued an executive order interpreting U.S. \nobligations under Common Article 3 to exclude the CIA’s interrogation \nprogram, and a future president may follow his lead.49 Nevertheless, courts \nmay still refer back to Hamdan to decide future cases, asserting that a policy \nreinstituting torture and abuse would violate those obligations and choosing \nto reject claims of executive privilege over interrogation issues. \n \nMore recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth District decided that a \nlawsuit brought by victims of torture could proceed against contractors \nresponsible for their torture at Abu Ghraib.

Whether any executive challenges are accepted by the courts, \nlawsuits against individual perpetrators of torture and abuse may deter future \nabuses. American courts have ruled that torture victims’ suits can proceed \nagainst Mitchell and Jessen, the psychologists who devised and applied the \nCIA’s EIT program, and CACI Premier Technology, Inc., the government \ncontractor whose employees were partially responsible for the abuses at Abu \nGhraib.51 Even if these cases do not result in judgments for the plaintiffs, they \nopen a path for victims to sue their torturers in U.S. courts, and therefore the \nthreat of civil liability may deter future torture and abuse. While judicial \ndecisions may not prevent a return to an official torture policy, it is unlikely \nthat once enacted, such a policy would survive judicial review. \n \nOther Factors \nPublic Opinion \nOne sign that torture could make a return is the significant support for it \namongst the American public, which has remained at high levels for over a \ndecade. A Pew poll in 2004 showed that when given the scenario “Torture to \ngain important information from terrorists can be justified” fifteen percent \nresponded Often and twenty-eight percent responded “Sometimes,” and in \n2011, 19 percent responded “Often” and thirty-four percent responded \n                                                          \n50 “No. 15-1831,” United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (2016): 34, \navailable at: https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/98_10-2116_Opinion-Vacating-Remanding_0.pdf.\n51 David Cole, “Will These 2 Court Cases Finally Hold Our Torturers Accountable?” The \nNation, May 10, 2016, available at: http://www.thenation.com/article/will-these-twocourt-cases-finally-hold-our-torturers-accountable/.\nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 10  No. 2\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol10/iss2/7\nDOI: http://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.10.2.1568\n', '111 \n“Sometimes.”52 In 2014, a Washington Post/ABC News poll asked “Looking \nahead, do you feel that torture of suspected terrorists can often be justified, \nsometimes justified, rarely justified, or never justified?” and seventeen \npercent of respondents answered “Often justified” while forty percent \nanswering “Sometimes justified.”53 This year, respondents to a similar \nquestion of “How do you feel about the use of torture against suspected \nterrorists to obtain information about terrorism activities?” answered twentyfive\npercent “Often justified,” and thirty-eight percent “Sometimes justified.”54  \n \nThese polls show that respondents who identify as Republicans favor the use \nof torture much more than those who identify as Democrats, a dynamic we \nsaw evidence of in the 2016 election as well (both Bernie Sanders and Hillary \nClinton vehemently rejected the use of torture).55 Experts have pointed out \nthat “public opinion on torture follows the same pattern of partisan \n‘sorting’…where partisan adherents readjust their beliefs on issues to \ncorrespond with signals they hear from party elites.”56 As the president and \nmany within the Republican majority seek to advocate and normalize the \npractice of torture, these trends may continue. There is some evidence to \nshow that Americans’ endorsement of torture declines when asked about \nspecific techniques (such as “punching/kicking” or waterboarding),57 or when \npresented with other options to elicit intelligence (when asked if the \ngovernment “should not use torture if we think there may be other ways to \nobtain information about terrorists,” for example).58 However, the level of \noverall support of torture of suspected terrorists does indicate that the \n                                                          \n52 “United in Remembrance, Divided over Policies,” Pew Research Center, September 1, \n2011, available at: http://www.people-press.org/2011/09/01/united-in-remembrancedivided-over-policies/#torture-chart.\n53 “Washington Post-ABC News Poll December 11-14, 2014,” Washington Post, January 4, \n2015, available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling/washingtonpostabc-news-poll-december-1114/2015/01/04/b6f831be-8518-11e4-abcf-\n5a3d7b3b20b8_page.html.  \n54  Ipsos, “Ipsos Poll Conducted for Reuters.” \n55 Dan Merica, “Torture Report Splits 2016 Democrats,” CNN, available at: \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/12/11/politics/2016-democrats-torture/; Shushannah \nWalshe, “Hillary Clinton Speaks Out Against U.S. Use of Torture,” available at: \nhttp://abcnews.go.com/US/hillary-clinton-speaks-us-torture/story?id=27654296. \n56 Paul Gronke, Darius Rejali, and Peter Miller, “No, Americans Aren’t ‘Fine with Torture.’ \nThey Strongly Reject It,” Washington Post, December 11, 2014, available at: \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/11/no-americansarent-fine-with-torture-they-strongly-reject-it/.\n57 Ibid. \n58 “Results of a National Survey: Views of the American Public about the Use of Torture,” \nBelden Russonello Strategists LLC, January 2015, available at: \nhttp://detaineetaskforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TCP-Poll-for-release-Jan2015.pdf.\nJacobson: Could the United States Reinstitute an Official Torture Policy?\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2016\n', '112 \nmajority of the American public could be supportive of a reversal of policy on \ntorture.  \n \nThe threat or occurrence of a future terrorist attack would also likely tip \npublic opinion toward approving torture. As retired U.S. Air Force general \nand law professor Charles Dunlap Jr. notes, “Don’t be surprised if the next \npoll shows that a sizable percentage of the American public would still \nsupport harsh interrogation techniques…in an extreme situation or especially \nin the aftermath of a serious terrorist attack by ISIL or al-Qaida.”59 There is \nalso evidence that media portrayals of torture being effective can make people \nmore willing to support its use. Researchers at American University have \nshown that after viewing media in which torture is portrayed as effective, \n“participants…had a higher level of stated support for torture post-test.” The \nstudy showed that not only did participants express more support for torture, \nbut also that they were also willing to act to express that support. The \nresearchers go on to note that “dramatic depictions of torture where it is \nshown to be effective can change both stated attitudes about the practice and \nwillingness to behaviorally support torture via signing a petition in support of \nit.”60 An increased approval of torture among the electorate, whether because \nof political influence from party elites, a terrorist attack on the United States, \nor media portrayals of torture being effective, would likely influence U.S. \ngovernment action on this issue and make maintaining the prohibition more \ndifficult. \n \nIntelligence Leaders and U.S. Military \nStatements from current and former CIA leadership and military leadership \nare also important to examine. Michael Hayden, CIA Director from 2006 to \n2009, received media attention for his sharp response to Trump’s comments \nadvocating torture.

Who could blame \nthem for refusing to expose themselves and their families to a reprise \nsomeday of the ordeal they have had to endure? I hope and trust no \nCIA director–or its lawyer–would countenance such an order.”63  \n \nHayden, who is also a retired Air Force General, noted that if given the order \nto kill the family members of terrorists (as Trump promised on the campaign \ntrail), “the American armed forces would refuse to act,” adding, “You are \nrequired not to follow an unlawful order. That would be in violation of all the \ninternational laws of armed conflict.”64 However, reviewing Hayden’s \nmemoir, Charlie Savage of the New York Times notes that since Hayden was a \nproponent of “enhanced interrogation techniques,” his protectiveness of the \nCIA and its employees are the likely root of his concerns, rather than \nopposition to the application of the techniques the agency used.65 \n \nObama Administration CIA Director John Brennan told NBC News, “I will \nnot agree to carry out some of these tactics and techniques I’ve heard bandied \nabout because this institution needs to endure…I would not agree to having \nany CIA officer carrying out waterboarding again.”66 A CIA spokesperson also \ntold Newsweek, “It is CIA Director Brennan’s resolute intention to ensure \nthat Agency officers scrupulously adhere to these [McCain-Feinstein \namendment] directives, which the Director fully supports.”67 However, these \nstatements are not as comforting as the CIA would hope.

Former Secretary of \nDefense Ash Carter told CNN, “[T]he Department of Defense follow the Army \nField Manual. It does not allow torture, and America conducts itself in \naccordance with its values…[F]or both effectiveness reasons and for reasons \nof reflecting our own values that we’re not going to do that sort of thing.”70 In \naddition, General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nunder Obama, responded to questions about using torture by saying, “When \nour young men and women go to war, they go with our values,” noting that \nthe military punishes those personnel who act outside those values.71 As noted \nabove, Secretary of Defense James Mattis has also been a stalwart opponent \nof using torture.72 \n \nWhether the CIA and U.S. military refuse to use torture because of a selfpreservation\ninstinct (fearing eventual prosecution or political blowback) or \nthe knowledge that torture is ineffective and immoral, the result would likely \nbe the same: The United States not officially employing torture or abusive \ninterrogation practices. However, if the major reason these institutions \noppose the use of torture is self-preservation, this does make the risk of a \nlapse back into torture more likely, especially if Congress legalizes the \npractice. Given the likelihood that a pro-torture president would appoint \nofficials who are pro-torture or ambivalent about its prevention, this poses \nserious challenges to maintaining prohibition. \n                                                          \n68 Marcy Wheeler, “CIA Officers Didn’t Carry Out Waterboarding,” Emptywheel, April 11, \n2016, available at: https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/04/11/cia-officers-didnt-carryout-waterboarding/.\n69 Zack Beauchamp, “Obama’s CIA Chief Won’t Rule Out Torture in the Future,” Vox, \nDecember 11, 2014, available at: http://www.vox.com/2014/12/11/7377977/brennantorture-obama.\n70 “Defense Secretary Ash Carter Says Torture is ‘Not the American Practice or Policy,’” \nCNN, March 24, 2016, available at: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/videos/1106354836073015/. \n71 Richard Sisk, “Joint Chiefs Chairman Rejects Trump’s Claim that ‘Torture Works,’” \nMilitary.com, February 25, 2016, available at: http://www.military.com/dailynews/2016/02/25/joint-chiefs-chairman-rejects-trumps-claims-that-torture-\nworks.html. \n72 Kristina Wong, “Pentagon: Mattis Still Opposes Torture Despite Trump Comment,” The \nHill, January 26, 2017, available at: http://thehill.com/policy/defense/316356-mattisremains-opposed-to-torture-pentagon-says.\nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 10  No. 2\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol10/iss2/7\nDOI: http://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.10.2.1568\n', '115 \n \nOther Views \nSome lawyers have argued that there are enough restrictions in place to \nprevent the return to an official torture policy.73 These arguments largely \nfocus on the possible actions of President Trump, but are useful to examine as \napplicable to any future administration. \n \nA good distillation of these arguments comes from Jack Goldsmith, former \nBush Administration Assistant Attorney General and current Harvard Law \nSchool professor. Goldsmith cautions against prematurely panicking about \nthe revitalization of a torture policy under President Trump. He writes that \nbecause of the bureaucracy’s commitment to the law and the fact that most \nofficials are not political appointments, “I do not believe that the armed \nservices under Trump will carry out orders to…unwind the interrogation \nconstraints in the Army Field Manual, because doing so would be clearly \nunlawful.”74 He also argues that internal constraints exist in the CIA and U.S. \nmilitary in the form of inspectors general. The person in this position \nGoldsmith notes, “sees himself or herself as beholden to Congress as the \nExecutive, and has authority to conduct basically any investigation and report \nthose findings to Congress,” adding that “The CIA Inspector General \neffectively ended waterboarding long before the practice became public.”75 \n \nAfter the election, Goldsmith also revisited an argument he made in his 2012 \nbook Power and Constraint arguing that a torture policy was unlikely. He \nnoted that the law governing interrogation policy was significantly \nconstrained during the Bush Administration, and that the law is “even stricter \nnow.”76 He also argued that the Bush Administration lawyers who created \nthat administration’s torture policy, Jay Bybee, John Yoo and others, faced \n“brutal recriminations,” and that government lawyers are now more \ncircumspect.77 Furthermore, he stated that the CIA experienced enough \npolitical blowback and abandonment over its use of torture from the rest of \n                                                          \n73 Adam Serwer, “Can Trump Bring Back Torture?” The Atlantic, January 26, 2017, \navailable at: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/trumptorture/514463/.\n74 Jack Goldsmith, “Libertarian Panic, Unlawful Action, and the Trump Presidency,” \nLawfare, November 22, 2016, available at: https://www.lawfareblog.com/libertarianpanic-unlawful-action-and-trump-presidency.\n75 Ibid. \n76 Jack Goldsmith, Twitter post, November 17, 2016, 3:32 p.m., available at: \nhttps://twitter.com/jacklgoldsmith/status/799349483704303617.  \n77 Goldsmith, Jack, Power and Constraint: The Accountable Presidency after 9/11 (New \nYork: W.W.

However, the illegality of \ntorture is what is driving this turn. As noted above, the CIA’s and military’s \nreluctance to engage in torture based on a fear of legal reprisal is not so \nencouraging, and even increases the likelihood that those entities would \nrevert if U.S. law re-legalized the practice. The major concern of the CIA and \nDepartment of Justice after 9/11, for example, was making sure that the CIA \nhad legal cover for its use of torture and abuse.79 If the U.S. government \nmakes torture official policy again, the hesitations that Goldsmith assumes \nthe CIA would show may not materialize. Additionally, Goldsmith’s claim that \nthe power of inspectors general would prevent a return to torture is flawed. \nInspectors general investigate past conduct, examining if/where that conduct \nviolated guidelines or laws. For example, a CIA Inspector General report on \npost-9/11 interrogation from October 2003 examined if interrogators \nexceeded legal guidelines in interrogating detainee Abd al-Rahman AlNashiri,\nnot the legality or efficacy of the approved techniques used on him.80 \nIn addition, even if an oversight report did indeed end the CIA’s use of \nwaterboarding, it happened after interrogators had already used that tactic. \n \nSimilarly, Goldsmith’s assertion that future officials would be less likely to \napprove torture because of the harsh consequences faced by tortureapproving\nlawyers, is suspect. While it is true that the lawyers Goldsmith \nmentions by name, Bybee and Yoo, earned public scorn for their legal \ndecisions, both have continued to enjoy fruitful careers. Bybee is a U.S. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals judge, while Yoo is the Emanuel S. Heller Professor of Law \nat the University of California’s Berkeley Law School and a regular \ncontributor to The National Review.81 Both The Federalist Society and the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute list these judges as experts.82 These hardly \n                                                          \n78 Ibid, 239. \n79  U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees. \n80 John L.

In fact, \nvirtually no one in the CIA or Bush Administration faced legal consequences \nfor the use of torture, even those who exceeded the lax guidelines in place (the \nCIA even promoted some).83 If Goldsmith sees threats of accountability as a \nbulwark against future torture policies, he is likely mistaken. \n \nConclusion \nWhile an American torture policy revival may not become reality under a \nPresident Trump, the country has not fully closed the door for future U.S. \npresidents. Reliance on an anti-torture majority in Congress may prevent this \neventuality in the short term, but even so, there are gaps that may allow an \nerosion of the ban. Even today, the susceptibility of the Army Field Manual to \nchanges or the exploitation of its ambiguities is a major weakness. More longterm,\nthe public’s favorable view of torture and its possible influence is \nanother danger to the prohibition. Without credible, powerful anti-torture \nvoices in the government, Congress could reverse course and/or not move to \nprevent executive action to revive a torture policy. Executive action taken \ntoday, such as the appointment of government officials who are either protorture\nor ambivalent about a ban, would likely push the government closer to \noverturning it. \n \nThe effects of an official torture policy, especially the likelihood of a return to \ntorture, deserve more analysis and debate than this article allows. \nConstitutional scholars and lawyers would likely have much more to add on \nthe separation of powers issues referenced. Also, U.S. policies of sending \nsuspects to other countries for coercive interrogation or transferring prisoners \nto foreign custody knowing they will be abused are also possibilities that \ndeserves more examination, especially given accusations that they are already \nhappening.84 \n \n                                                          \nFederalist Society, available at: http://www.fed-soc.org/experts/detail/john-c-yoo; \n“John Yoo,” American Enterprise Institute, available at: \nhttps://www.aei.org/scholar/john-yoo/.  \n83 Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo, “CIA Officers Make Grave Mistakes, Get Promoted,” \nNBC News, February 9, 2011, available at: \nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/id/41484983/ns/us_news-security/t/cia-officers-makegrave-mistakes-get-promoted/#.WDXzIPorKM8.\n84 Shane Harris and Nancy A.
