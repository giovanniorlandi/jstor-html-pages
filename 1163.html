The reinforced work with all\nmetal covered is the cheapest and\nwas asked fov by parties who have\nbeen and are yet great dealers in\ncast iron work. The contractors es\ntimated for concrete arches in beams\nbnt were told that beams were not\nwanted and they were shown a walk\nclose by. where the unprotected\ngirder beam or header had corroded\nand scaled off. until only the top and\nbottom flanges were left, the entire\nconnecting wedge had disappeared.\n"Often where sidewalks have been\nordered and are badly needed in\nfront of unproductive property,\nsometimes requiring a great deal of\nfilling, tliis is put in and a concrete\nwalk is laid at considerable cost that\nproves great waste ot money. It.\n•t\'ould be far better and o.ren would\ncost less to build a walk of reinforc\ned concrete on a concrete wall or\n! on columns and girders.\nι "These supports should be set\n[two or three feet in front of the\nI building line, that their foundation\n1 will not be disturbed when vxcava\n; t ion for walls and piers of t he\n! building, the sidewalk slabs will be\nI supported 011 the walls or columns,\n; and extended over the line of sup\nI port up to tile building line.

This\nwas cheered, and the crowd\ngrew silent once more to hear\nthe speaker as he continued.\nIt will be perceived that this or\n! gan of malice and dissension pur\nj ports to quote Johnson\'s statement\n! exactly, and I have no doubt that it]\n! has rejiorted w hat Johnson said with\n: substantial accuracy. If Johnson had\nι been an honest man and willing for\nj the people to know the truth, he\n\' would have told them that the fee\nj w hich I received from the Standard\nI Oil company was for an opinion\n; which 1 gave them and in\n\'which $ told them that\nI they could not lawfully trans\n; act business in this state, and warn\nI ed them that If they attempted to\n(do so their property would be ab\n| sorhed in penalties and their officers\ni prosecuted as criminals. But instead\n! of telling the whole story, which is\n! highly creditable to me both as a\nlawyer and as a man, he suppresses\ni an important part of it and te\'.Is only\nI that which when told with the other\npart omitted is equivalent to a direct\nj and positive lie.—Senator Bailey at\n] Houston.\nBut has Mr. Bailey told the whole\ntruth? That is an essential question\n■ in our efforts to get the record\nstraight. Here is what Cullen Thoni\n; as said to the people of San Angelo:\n! "Mr. Bailey testifier! he told Pierce\nat their first meeting that Texas peo\nj pie would not tolerate Standard Oil\nmethods And yet we find him look\ning for a loop hole in the law by\nwhich they might do buisness in Tex\n: as. Nay. more. In the great joint\n; discussion between Crane and Bailey\nat Houston. Mr. Bailey said before\n! 10.000 people: "1 never practiced\n, law for a monopoly one day in my\nlife." Tnat was before his confession\nι was drawn from him on oath on the\nwitness stand. Do you understand\nits meaning? Let me explain it to\nyou. The people of Texas have built\na great anti-trust wall around her\nborders, by toil and money and ser\nvice. Her yeomanry: her officials,\n.began down on the Gulf coast and\nbuilt that wall around the Louisana\n: line and up the Arkansa line and to\n. New Mexico and to the Rio Grand.\nWhat for° To protect the masses of\nthe state of Texas from spoliation by\nthese trust pirates, and when they\nbuilt it, not yet contented that they\nare secure, they selected their ser\n; vants to guard that wall. Their chos\n< en picket is Joseph W. Bailey. In the\nnight whiie you are asleep. while\n■ trusting him as on picket duty, we\nfind him with a lantern in his hand\nfollowing that wall looking for a\nhole through the wall: looking for\na low place in the wall over which\nor through which John D. Rockefel\n; 1er may crawl. Fellow citizens, you\n: hired him for a soldier. He becomes\nspy for the enemy. T\'nder which\nflag was he fighting? You trusted him\nas your watch dog. and he barks all\nnight loud and long, but in the night\ntime he is eating the fat meat of\nlohn D. Rockefeller and becomes\nhis watch dog. In this presence, I\ndenounce hi- receipt of that money\na- a breach of iaith to the people of\nTexas That is. lie was disloyal to\nthem. Why. h«- claimed virtue be\ncause he told them they could not\ncome into T^xa- If he is an honest\nlawyer, and I doubt nor he is, he will\ngive to his client an honest opinion.\nIf you go to Judge Hill or your chos\nen lawyer at this bar and pay him\nfor an opinion, you want the truth.\nIf his opinion is for you. you want it.\n. If it is against you. it is his duty to\ngive it to you. Then suppose he has\nfound a flaw in the law. his duty to\n: his client is to show him the flaw.\nI His duty to you, and you are his\n. client, is to stop up the flaw There\nis a divided duty. Which will he fol\nlow? You pay him $5,000 for a\nI w hole year\'s work. He gets half that\n\'amount for one night\'s work, and is\nI but the beginning of the story.\nI "1 charge here and base my charge\n: on the record, that he took» Î2·:ι00\nι from the Standard Oil company to\n] tell them they could not come into\nTexas, and then took 15,000 from\n,them to show them how they could\ncome into Texas. How did he do so?\nListen\' What the Standard Oil com\npany could not do directly, it did in\ndirectly. When il could uot come in \'\nunder its own name, it came in un\nder the name of an alias*, the sorriest\nmark of acriminal. How came it\nhert " By its charter. How lives a cor\nIioration? By its charter. Who drew \'\nthat charter and mortgage? Our sen\nator. Who sat at the directors\' board\nand organized them? Our senator.\nWho blew the breath of life into its\nnostrils? Our senator. How much\ndid lie get? $5,000. How long did it\ntake him? He said one day. The at\ntorney general of Texas has tiled\nsuit, at Austin to drive out this oil\ncompany on the ground that it is\na blind tiger for the Standard Oil\ncompany. Bailey brings back the\nWaters-Pierce Oil company; David\nson drives it out. Bailey draws a\ncharter for the Security Oil com\npany; Davidson files suit to take\naway that charter. Bailey is busy :\nbringing back the trusts; Davidson\nis busy driving out the trusts."\nIf .Mr. Thomas has told the truth,\nand he says he bases his charge on\nthe record, then it would seem that i\nMr. Bailey has suppressed an import- |\nant part of the story.\nIt is up to Mr. Bailey to make Mr.\nThomas our a liar—if he can.\nThe purpose of the Times-Herald\nis to get tlie record straight.\n* * *\nComing back for a moment to Mr.\nBailey\'s declaration at Smithville,\nquoting Houston Post reports, "that j\nbefore he would stoop to furnishing !\ndocumentary evidence to sustaia \'\nstatements he had made to the peo\nple of Texas, he would first cut off\nhis good right arm." the record\nshows that in Austin in January,\n1901, he thus stated to the inves\ntigating committee;\n"Much has been said about my\npurchase of 6000 acres of land from ;\nHon. Barnett Gibbs, and it has been ]\ncharged that 1 obtained this land as ι\ncompensation for my service to the ι\nWaters-Piecre Oil company. I there- j\nfore, desire to submit to this com- ι\nmittee a full and detailed statement \'\nof that transaction."\nAfter submitting the state- j\nment. Mr. Bailey said to the com\nmittee;\n"It is not pleasant to feel compel!- j\ned to make a public statement of\nmy private business affairs, and it !\nis still more disagreeable to feel com- i\npelled to state the private business |\naffairs of other gentlemen. But a ;\nman cannot stand upon a question^\nof that kind when his integrity is ι\nassailed; and I have deemed it aj\nduty to myself, my friends, and most ,\nof all, to my party and to my state,\nto have every dollar of the money \\\npaid for and received from the land, i\ncattle, horses and mules purchased !\nby me from Mr. Gibbs, so that no\nhonest man can ever again misun- I\nderstand the transaction, and no\nscoundrel can ever again misrepre- j\nsent it."\n•lust getting the record straight; ;\nthat\'s all.\nThe Madam Editor of the Tim μ- i\nson Times has evidently made a hit\nfin the hat ([u est ion. A well known\nminister has handed in the following,\n1 aragraph from the Times with his j\niiili endorsement; "The new hats j\nmay be very picturesque and becom- !\ning, and more humane than for,\n\' many years past, but for all that,\n! one can not sit behind one of these\nuouoing screens wunoui ieenng re\nI sentment toward the wearer, and no\nI thought of her pretty face and ga\nI zelle-iike eyes can dispel it. If worn- ;\nen and girls would keep old friends 1\nand make new ones, they must re- \'\nmove their hats in public audiences. 1\nOne other alternative, offered by the j\nHemphill Leader, is for them to oc- j\nj cupy the back row or sit on the\nfloor in front."\nCone Johnson says Senator Bailey !\nwill probably "saw his arm off" at\'\nthe last moment, and further pre-,\ndiets that the operation will prove \\\nfatal. Yes, Joe is getting desperate!\nand is liable to do most anything. j\nHand of Local Musicians.\nThe committee appointed to secure j\na band for the Bailey speaking on\nThursday has been at work today !\nand as a result a band composed of\nlocal musicians has been organized.\nThree of the young ladies playing in\nthe Chicago Ladies Orchestra with\nNorth Brothers at the opera house\nthis week have kindly consented to\nassist the boys with the music.

If j\nthese street corner and sidewalk ora- j\ntors were given the attention their\nability justifies doubtless the one vi\ntal question engaging the earnest\nconsideration of all honest and\nthoughtful Texans would soon be\nforever settled and the wheels of\ncommerce would begin to whirl with\nrenewed energy.
