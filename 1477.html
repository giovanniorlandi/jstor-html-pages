On\nthe same day telegraphic advices were\nreceived from Washington that Presi\ndent Wilson had apiointed Adjutant\nGeneral Sullivan as disbursing officer\nto pay out moneys necessary to conduct\nthe registration.\nIn connection with the registration\non June 5th, which takes place from 7\na. m. to 9 p. m.. it may be well to say\nthat it commands "all male persons"\nfrom 21 to 30 to register under penalty\nfor failure. This means all men who\nhave passed their 21st birthday on June\n5, 1917, and who have not reached their\n31st birthday.

That the application is premature\nfor the reason that it is impossible to\nforesee what the traffic conditions will\nbe during the next year or two.\n2. That in any event 15 per cent\nupon the entire mass of freight traffic\nis too much to be allowed merely by\nway of anticipation.\n3. That a horizontal raise of any\npercentage will work grave injustice,\nbecause no two railroads are situated\nalike, and because, further, the rate.\non some classes and commodities are\nmuch higher relatively than the rates\nupon others.\n4. That any raise at this time would\nbe unjust to the intermountain states\nfor the reason that they are already\nsubject to a disadvantageous differen\ntial in favor of the coast points. That\nto raise the rates uniformly 15 per cent\nwould increase the differential and put\nthe intermountain states at a still great\ner disadvantage.\n5. That rates in the intermountain\nregion are already excessive by com\nparison with rates elsewhere; that this\nis true upon both east bound and west\nbound freight into this section of the\ncountry.\nThe protest concludes with an urgent\nappeal for settlement of the intermoun\ntain cases by the total elimination of\nall differentials against that section be\nfore any adjustment is made under the\npetition filed by the carriers for an ad\nvance. The commission is hopeful that this\ncourse will be pursued.\nWant Governor to Speak\nat Their Demonstration\nNEVADA AND CALIFORNIA\nIN TRAPSHOOTING CONTEST\nR. K.

You know that congress already has appropriated\nseven billion dollars for war purposes, and practically the first shot\nlias yet to be tired from an American gun.\nSeven billion dollars is a great deal of money but it is NOT\ngoing to cripple us financially.\nIn the first place, the income of the United States is thirty\nseven billion dollars a year over five times as much.\nMoreover most of that seven billion dollars will be spent right\nhere in the United States and that means, in plain Knglish, that\nseven billion dollars, which was drawing interest in the bank, will\nbe OUT of the bank and IN the hands of the butcher, the baker, the\ncandlestick maker, the farmer, the merchant, the manufacturer, and\nevery other human being in America, who has either goods he has\nmade, products lie has raised, or work that he can do to sell.\nThe government is going to pay out millions upon millions for\nships, anil the out lifting for ships.\nThat means not only work for shipbuilders and iron workers\nand steel workers, it means work for lumbermen and work for\nlumbermen means the sale of boots, and heavy socks, and beans, and\nbacon, and Hour for the lumber camps.\nWhen the great lumber camps begin to buy supplies for their\ngreat armies of men, every man with an acre of beans in this country\nwill have money of his own to put in the bank.\nThis principle works right on down straight through the\nWIFOLK LIST of industries, of products and of labor.\noo\n\'STRATEGIC RETIREMENT\nThe kaiser didn\'t know that the war was so heavily loaded\nwhen he touched it off. Albany Journal.\nWhen the question of what to do with a former emperor is\nraised in Germany he will be too unpopular in America to get the\njob in the Chicago stock yards for which his life ambition has\ntrained him Louisville Courier-Journal.\nThe kaiser has taken his post within an easy jump of the Dutch\nboundary, and we have no doubt that Holland is ready to receive\nhim. Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville.)\nThe reported offer by the kaiser of Gibraltar and Morocco to\nSpain, for aid in the war, reminds one of the man who used to sell\nthe Brooklyn bridge every morning. Kansas City Times.\nA good many of us are still neutral in the sense that we don\'t\ncare whether it\'s the French or the British Avho break the German\nline. Charleston News.\noo\nQUAKERS IN WAR\n"The Quakers may be depended upon, however, to prove loyal\nto the nation and to human liberties," says the Public Ledger, "even\nif they show it in as peculiar a way as one of their number who was\na ship\'s captain and lay at anchor in a foreign port. Espying a\npiratical-looking fellow coming up a rope over the side of the ship,\nhe said :\n" \'Friend, if thee wants that rope thee can have it,\' and he cut\nthe rope letting the marauder \'down to a watery grave, quickly and\nquietly."\nTROUBLES OF YE PRINTER\nRoosevelt is by no means our only phrase maker. There is,\nfor instance, the man who invented the "strategic retirement," who\never he is. And observe how the idea of "strategic retirement" has\nseized imagination of the house majority at Washington. Leaders\nof retreat, that group of priority rule "leaders" in the house have\nbeen called. Clark, who sees no difference between a conscript and\na convict; Kitchen, whose leadership is of the right-about-face\nvariety; Dent, whose first great opportunity to lead was surrendered\nto a Republican member of his committee on military affairs; Gor\ndon, another member of the Dent committee, the senator of the\nhouse, whose idea of leadership is to obstruct all of them masters\nof the "strategic retirement."\nAnd in the senate we have William Joel Stone, of the same\nbrand of Missouri patriotism as the speaker of the house. An oc\ncasional "strategic retirement" may be desirable. But leaders who\nconfine their activities to that kind of action will soon find them\nselves shorn of their credit if not of their nominal authority.\nCleveland Plain Dealer.\nCarson Valley Bank\nCarson City\nNevada\nCapital, fully paid.\n. 150.000.00\nOFFICERS\nfit .

The de\npartment of justice, in response to re\nports from all sections of the country\nof sharp advances in the price of Unit\ned States flags since the development of\nthe demand inspired by the declaration\nof a state of war, has begun an investi\ngation to ascertain whether the ad\nvances result from price fixing, in vio\nlation of the Shrrman Anti-trust law.\nDepartment officials say that in some\ninstances, according to their reports,\nflag manufacturers have advanced\nprices a full 100 per cent.\nThe department is receiving scores of\nletters dailv calling attention to acts\nwhich, in the opinion of the writerh.\nconstitute descreation of the flag\nthrough its use for advertising pur\nposes. Lack ot tederal legislation\nmakes it impossible for the department\nto interfere in the majority of these\ncases.\nWhile many of the states have enact\ned laws regulating the use of the flag,\nthe coiistituliniialitv of which has been\nupheld by the Supreme court of the\nUnited States in the case of Halter vs.\nNebraska, the only federal law on the\nsubject is the act of February 8, 101".\nwhich applies only to the District of\nColumbia. It makes punishable the im\nproper use of the national colors in the\ndistrict.\nAll circumstances and conditions being equal, newspapers\nought to bear their just proportion of taxes laid against business.\nBut it so happens that the relations of the press to the government\nand the people are naturally different from the relations sustained\nby a mercantile business.\nIt is difficult to see where the government would be able to\ncommunicate quickly and efficiently with the people but through\nthe press. Today everything we know about the war is due to the\nmediumship of the press. All the people know about the activities\nof the several departments of the public, service has been learned\nfrom the press. Printer\'s ink is a vital and indispensible factor in\nthe activities of popular government\nIt is no secret that, as a result of the upward tendency of mate\nrials and labor, the average paper not in the metropolitan class has\nabout all the business problems and perplexities it , can carry. To\nimpose a tax of 5 per cent on its collections, without reference as\nto whether they represent a deficit or profit, seems unfair. It is es\npecially so in view of the service the press renders and for which it\nis not paid.\noo\nELIMINATE THE SUFFRAGE QUESTION\nIn a recent letter President Wilson appears to have taken posi\ntive ground in favor of speeding up national action on women\'s\nsuffrage, says the Stockton .Mail. There now exists no reason why\nthe opponents of suffrage should continue their opposition. The\nmost they can do is to delay it. The sooner society accepts the\nchange the sooner destiny will work its will. Even the fact that\nthere is room for strong division on principle or expediency does not\njustify delay. Suffrage for women is coming. It should be elim\ninated as an issue. We have plenty of others.\nThe pressure in latter day democracy is favorable to every\nmeasure emphasizing the equal political rights of the adult indi\nvidual. Indeed, even the children are gaining well defined rights.\nIf this tendency culminates in social error, the fact must be deter\nmined and the problem met by the generations that are to come.\n00\nIt\'s easy to talk about "drafting bachelors" but it\'s hard to\nland \'em.
