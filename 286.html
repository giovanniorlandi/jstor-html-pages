It\nbringing tbe highest price ever known\nIn the history of the trade. The crop,\naccording to Samuel R. Ward, superin\ntendent of the State Tobacco Ware\nhouse, ia the largest since the year\nbefore the Civil War, end still there\nis not enough to equal the demand.\nThe 1918 crop Is estimated to exceed\n35,000 hogsheads. 25.000 of which al\nready have been brought to the city\nThe remaining 10,000 are held up be\ncause of an embargo that haa beer\nplaced on the bay boats and railroads\nThe State warehouse, built to hold\n19.378 hogsheads, now has more thur\n24,000 stored in It. and regulations al\nlowing only as much tobacco to come\nin as Is being shipped out have had\nto be put into force.\nThe new crop is selling at an aver\nage of 45 cents a pound, with a maxi\nmum of 47 cents. A few years ago\nMaryland tobacco sold at 8 or 10 cents\na pound, which means that tbe product\nhas increased nearly 400 per cent,\nwithin two years. Government taxes\nhave been responsible for the jump, to\na certain extent, but the farmer, never\ntheless, gets more than three times as\nmuch for his tobacco today as he got\nin 1917.\nj The demand for Maryland tobacco is\n! greater now than it ever was. Mr.\nWard said. Imported tober ;o, such as\nthe Turkish and Egyptian brands, Is\nno longer on the market in any quan\ntitles, and manufacturers must seek\nthe nearest substitute. The Maryland\nproduct closely resembles Turkish to\nbacco, because both burn easily and\nquickly and are very dry. Southert.\ntobacco burns slowly, and cigarettes\nmade ffrora It will not burn unless in\nhaled/continuously. In this respect\nMaryland and Turkish tobacco are\npractically identical, Mr. Ward said.\nThe European countries are buying\nthe American product and much of it\nis being shipped from Baltimore. The\nFrench Government has an order for\n15,000 hogsheads and importing firms\nin Belgium and England take large\nquantities. Much of this is Maryland\ntobacco and the rest is from Kentucky,\nbut shipped from Baltimore. Three\nsteamships now in Baltimore harbor\nwill load cargoes In which tobacco will\n* figure.\n} The last of the present crop will not\n, be in until December, It is believed by\nshippers, because it must be shipped\nslowly until the congestion at the\nI warehouse is relieved. The crop usu\nj ally ii in by November. At this time\nof the year there are seldom more\nthan 5.000 hogsheads remaining to be\nI shipped to Baltimore, and. Mr. Ward\nsaid, there are now 10.000 still on the\nfarms or bay piers to find\nspace in the local warehouse.\nAmerican Legion Plans Convention.\nPlans are being made by the Ameri\ncan Legion for tts State convention,\nj which will take place at the Emerson\ni Hotel on October 3. At this convention\n1 permanent officers will be elected and\nj delegates to he first national conven\n| tion of the American Legion will be\nnamed.

SEPTEMBER 12. 1919.\nThe Primaries Over.\nThe primary election which was\nheld throughout this state on Mon\nday to determine the nominees of\nthe respective political parties for\nthe various offices to be filled are\nover, and passed off quietly to the\ngreat satisiaction of the people at\nlarge. The primary election law\nwas put upon the statute books for\nthe distinct purpose of doing away\nwith the bosses and placing m the\nhands of the people at large the\nright to select through their votes\nthe nominees for the various of\ntices. The results of every primary\nelection since the law went into ef\nfect has demonstrated with possi\nbly a few exceptions that the bosses\nand not the people name the party\nnominees. As we see it this will\ncontinue until a revolution takes\nplace against the bosses. The peo\nple at large evidently have never\ngrasped the opportunity which i>\ntheirs in Maryland to select the\nnominees, but have practically let\nthe matter go by default, permit\nting the bosses to do as they\npleased. The little interest mani\nfested by the people in primary\nelections’ leads one to the con\nclusion that we might as well re\nturn to the old convention system.\nThere is little difference in the\nbosses nominating one way or the\nother, and it would appear to be\nbetter for them to select the candi\ndates in the way which would\nprove most inexpensive to the tax\npayers of the State. Under the\nprimary system the people are put\nat a very heavy expense. The\nprimary election system as now\noperated is simply a small club over\nthe head of the bosses which may\nbe used, but from past experience\nis not likely to be used by the\npeople.\nThe primaries being over the re\nspective parties will now line up\nfor the general fight in the coming\nNovember election. The republican\nparty fortunately nominated their\nState ticket without a primary con\ntest which, therefore, will leave no\nwounds to heal, as they did also\nlocally in this county except for the\nlegislature, which contest was de\nvoid of interest and will leave no\nsore spots. The party, therefore,\nwill go into this campaign a united\nand happy family, and should and\nwe believe will win in the election\nin November. Every republican in\nview of the fact that we have a\nmost excellent State and local\nticket, should put his shoulder to\nthe wheel and use every effort to\nnot only elect both our State and\nlocal ticket but send them across\nthe wire winners by a large ma\njority. The republican party has\nan opportunity to elect their State\nticket, which is the best that we\nhave had in Maryland for a num\nber of years and, therefore, it be\nhooves every republican to grasp\nthe opportunity that is his to help\nin winning ji great victory for his\nparty in November.\nStuffed Owls as Crow Decoys.\n•f ——i\nThere is no doubt but that the\nwily crow, and he is the wiliest ot\nall birds, wilt read this story and\ntake warning. However, E. Lee\nLeCompte will take a chance. He\nhas inaugurated, in conjunction\nwith national agencies, a campaign\nfor the killing of destructive crows\nin Maryland.\nTo kill the crow it is first neces\nsary to get within gunshot distance.\nTo accomplish this very difficult\nfeat Mr. LeCompte suggests the\nuse of decoys.\nStuffed owls placed on the con\nspicuous limb ot a dead tree serve\nthe desired purpose. A wounded\ncrow staked out in the open will\nalso attract great numbers ot\ncrows. A large piece of meat or\nthe carcass of a dead animal placed\nin an opening serves as excellent\nbait and one well-placed shot will\noften kill several crows at once.\nThe E. I. du Pom de Nemours\nCompany, Wilmington, Del., are\noffering desirable trophies to per\nsons killing crows in the United\nStates. The contest is open until\nDecember 1. The du Pont Com\npany encourages and enlists the aid\nof an army of shooters, and in\nvites every owner of a gun to enter\nthis contest.\nThe State Game and Fish De\npartment urges farmers and sports\nmen’s organizations throughout the\nstate to co-operate and make a\ncombined campaign against the\ncrow hosts. Deputy game wardens\nare also instructed to assist in re\nducing the ranks of this enemy ot\nthe game. They have been allowed\nto increase to such an alarming ex\ntent that they are a decided menace\nto agricultural and sporting inter\nests. ihe destruction within the\nyear next of thousands of crows\nwill mean the increase of hun\ndreds ot thousands of song and\ngame birds.\nA national crow shoot has been!\ninaugurated in the United States\nthis year and the campaign mate\nal issued says: “It is estimated\nU every year insects cause a loss\ntillions of dollars to the farmer,\ntruck raisers and fruit growers.!\nThe farmers arc the producers, hnd\nwhatever loss they sustain affects J\nevery consumer in the country.\nSong birds are the natural enemies\nof all insect life, song birds alone\ncan keep in check the ravages of v\ninsects. Crows destroy birds, birds 1\ndestroy insects, insects destroy\ncrops —therefore, kill the crows 1\nand save the crops.”\nApril, May and June are the ! I\nproper months of the year to make\nan organized attempt to eradicate\nthe pests. The crows’ nests "larc -\nusually repaired or built anew the\nlatter part of March and four to\nseven eggs are laid early in April.\nThe period of incubation covers\nfrom 17 to 18 clays and the young!\nremain in the nest about three\nweeks after hatching. Sportsmen\nand farmers should co-operate at\nthis time and destroy as many\ncrows’ nests and shoot as many\nparent birds as possible.\nBeing scavengers, crows carry\nthe germs of the dreaded hoot\' and\nmouth disease, hog cholera, glan\nders. etc., which are lurking in\ncountless numbers in every decay\ning bit of carrion. Farmers look\non the visits of the crow to their\nfarm yards with dread and appre\nhension. Crows undoubtedly de\nstroy a large amount of song and\ngame birds before they are through\nnesting, and also destroy their eggs\nand young.\nCrows do not confine their hunt\ning to small areas; they scour the\nountry for miles around their\nhaunts. They search tirelessly the\nforests, the brush and the marsh\nfor the eggs and the young useful\ninsectivorous and game birds.\nCrows show an almost uncanny\nintelligence in their ability to ferret\nout the nests and memorize their\nlocations. The wily black demons\nwill drop into meadows and fields\nnear where numerous quail are\nnesting and industriously start on a\nbug hunt. Let a mother quail leave\nher nest, however, for a warm dust\nbath or a cool drink of spring water\nand the black shadow of that crow\nwill darken the little nest and the\nravenous maws of the ugly crow\nbabes will be filled with the contents\nof fresh quail eggs, young quail in\nthe embryo state, and even young\njuail themselves.\nThe sustenance of the young of\ninsectivorous birds is composed al\nmost wholly of insects, and they\nrequire such an enormous amount\nihat the parent birds are forced to\n. >pend practically the entire day in\nsect hunting, leaving their young\nunprotected. The crows walk\nthrough the underbrush and hedge-\nrows and devastate birds’ homes.\nThe loss to agricultural interest in\nthis wholesale destruction of useful\nbird life is appalling to- one who\nknows the insect destroying capa\nbilities of the song birds.—Balti\nmore American.\nT* C f 1 cow, $100.00; 2\nrOI* S 3 £ " ws * 75 - ,x): 1\n11 o >u\\ *65.00; lcow\n♦60.00.

The meetings held sc\nfar have without exception, proven the\npopularity of the movement. So fai\nmany hundreds of contracts have been\nsigned and sent in to the Association\nheadquarters and a preliminary survey\nshows conclusively that the wind up of\nthe campaign will show the Tobacco\nGrowers pledged for far more than the\nrequired fifty per cent of the tobacco\ngrown in Southern Maryland. Just\nhow much more, it is, of course, im\npossible to say at this time, however, a\nnumber of men who are active in the\ncampaign estimate that the Association\nwill control 90 per* cent of the tobacco\ngrown in Southern Maryland.\nIt is urged by Association officials that\nin the Districts where meetings have\nalready been held that the growers who\ndid not get signed up at the meetings\nshould, at once, get in touch with a\nmember of their Local District Com\nmittee and sign up. Many growers in\nthis county have already come into t\'.te\nAssociation’s office in the Court House\nand signed the contract. If any grower\nhappens to be in La Plata it will only\ntake a few minutes of his time to drop\nin at headquarters and sign his contract.\nIt is pointed out that as many gkowers\nas possible should make an effort to\nsign the contract during the next few\ndays and thus save the Association the\nexpense necessary to a personal call.\nAUTUMN WEDDING\nAmong the fall weddings of interest\nwill be that of Miss Lydia Corning\nMills, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George\nThomas Mills, of Roland Park, and Mr.\nJ.

Jameson, of Bryantow-n, this\nebunty. He is a promising young man\nand now holds a responsible position in\nWashington.

Mr. Editor, as I see it.\n-here is what 1 would call a silent strike\naking place over the country that u\noinething is not done to stop it 1 feai\nvill prove a very serious obstacle in the\n•ay of lowering prices. This strike, il\n: may be permuted to so call it, is noi\n■lie of the organized and well-planned\n.trikes we read of. it is not the choice\n>t those who are a part to it.\nThe farmers of today are facing a\n>iip t they cannot overcome, atiu\nCithern are being forced to\n• •%}, tlteir farming\'opera\nt of making enough to\n—,;*and their families. Not\n* iheir own, 1 repeat, for no\n- jf,\\c people live than the farni\nlSt.t labor is impossible to get, ana\n£bcn you get it the price to be paid is\njrohibitive. Fertilizers, it is true, havt\n•een lowered to some extent, but are\njlill very high, while machinery is from\n.00 to 150 per cent higher than a few\n,cars ago. ihe only man who can farm\nit all with any satisfaction is the man\nwho has sons of lus own and is willing\n-o sacrifice their education and make\nfarm hands of them.\nNow let us take the price of pork in\n•he papers last week, i read where\njvery road leading to Chicago was filled\nwith hogs and cattle, farmers unloading\n.heir stock before the decline. Owing\no the war on meat prices hogs had gone\nlown to 15 cents a pound.\nMr. Editor, you cannot raise 15-ceni.\npork on SBO per ton middlings and $lO\nper barrel corn. It simply cannot be\nlone. I have been a hog raiser for 40\nyears and 1 know it cannot be done.\nAnd, again, if the farmer unloads his\n-dock to save himself will he run the\nrisk and raise more? Hardly.\nThe investigators had better go slow\non the farmer. The idea that the aver\nage farmer is living in luxury is a mis\ntaken one. Let me ask how many farm\ners have the comforts and conveniences\nin their homes that the workingman ot\nthe city has? How many have electric\n•ights and bathrooms? Not one in a\n.mndred, and are they not entitled to it?\n■Suppose tile farmer should strike for an\neight-hour day. Do you realize where\nprices would go? And still he is face to\ntace with 10-hour help at three and four\nnines, even higher, prices than iormerly\npaid; that is, it he can get it. Then is\nthere any reason why the toiling farmer\nand his family should not resort to one\nof two things—do just what they can\nfor themselves or give up and join the\never-growing mass of consumers, there\nuy decreasing the producer?\nAnd they are decreasing very rapidly,\nilow many of the soldier boys are go\ning back to the farm? About 5 or id\nper cent, I think, will cover it. No. Mr.\nEditor, the cost of production has gui\nto be lowered, and all the strikes tilt\nworkingmen or organized labor cai.\nmake will not improve the situation in\nihe country, it will, on the other hand,\nonly make matters worse. Of course, 1\nJo not want to lie understood that there\nare no grounds for fighting the profited\',\nfor 1 firmly believe he should be sought\n[ out and when found be severely dealt\nwith. What 1 am contending is that the\n| farmers cannot stand any lower prices\nthan they now receive, and that to tani\n| per with that part of it is a very serious\n| and dangerous thing to do. His lot is no\n, bed of roses. It is not an eight-hour\nday he works. It is a twelve or four\nteen hour clay, and no pay for overtime\nand Sunday. So if the city man thinks\nit is such a nice thing to be a farmer we\nextend to him an invitation to come\ndown some time when it is 90 degrees\nin the shade and take a hand at thresh\nt ing wheat. What we farmers want is\n. a fair and just reward for our labor.\nWilliam J. Frere.\nTompkinsville, Md., Sept. 4.\nJ •\n1 FAMOUS ARMY REVIEWS\nl ■ -\nOn September 17 take place one\n~ \' of the famous Army reviews, when the\nj gallant Ist Division will march down\nn j Pennsylvania avenue. What do you re\ntv member of the grand review in 1865:\nn Read the interesting article on this sub\ng ject in The Washington Star, Sunday,\nSeptember 14. •\nAGRICULTURAL NOTES\nFrom the way the Contracts and Notes\nr are being signed it looks as though we\nwill soon have a Tobacco Growers’ As\nsociation that will mean much to the\nfarmers of Southern Maryland. Some\nfew farmers hesitate about signing the\ncontract I cannot understand why as\n. there is nothing whatever to lose by\nsigning and there may be much to gain\nI Now is the time to be thinking about\nthe winter manure. The more manure\nwe can make and put out on our farms\nthe less fertilizers we will have to use to\nsecure good crops. Although it is a\n( matter of experience that the more fer\ntilizers of the right kind we use with\nour manure the more profit we reap\nfrom the use of manure. Anything that\nwe can use with which to bed our\nhorses, cows, and sheep will help make\nmanure. Those corn stalks that are sc\noften left in the field where corn is\ntopped and bladed would he worth much\ntnore than the little trouble of getting\nthem to the stables.\n.Corn matures much better if it is cut\noff on the stalk and let mature in\nshocks. Then the stalks will much\nmore likely lie hauled to the stable ano\nused for bedding. The ideal way, ol\ncoarse, is to shred the fodder and thus\n.nake the stales easier to manage. If\nyou once shredded your fodder yon\nwould make a very great effort to do it\nevery year.\nThe large stacks of wheat straw found\nall over the county should he carefully\ncared for that good dry bedding might\nbe on hand at any time for the horse\nand cow.\nMany fields of weeds that have grown\n40 abundantly this summer ought to be\ncut and stacked for bedding.\nThe clover fields that have a heavy\ngrowth of weeds upon them will do\nmuch better next year if those weeds\nare cut down and left on the fields this\nwinter and raked off next spring and\nthe rakings put in the ham yard.\nJOHN P.

Singing is taught\nthere,\n“You see, Millie, dear," she contin\nued, “years ago when we sang Just\nlike the Katydid family the Fairy\nQueen was giving a concert one night.\n** ‘Locusts,’ she snld to us, *1 want\nsome other singers to take parts which\nare like the Katydids\' parts, but a lit\ntle softer. That will help the whole\neffect of the singing. It will make It\nso lovely to have different voices, dif\nferent sounds, different tones. Then\nIt will be such a beautiful concert,\nsuch an exquisite concert. Do you\nthink you could help me. Locusts?’\n“Now, of course, we wanted to do\neverything we could for the Fairy\nQueen and for her concert. So we had\na huge meeting that very afternoon of\nall the locusts. We put signs around\nthe meadow on all the tall blades of\ngrass and told all the locusts to come\nto the meeting.\n“They arrived at all times, for as\nsoon as they saw notices they come,\nbut some of them had been taking naps\nor had been off walking and hopping\nand weren\'t on the lookout for signs\nand notices.\n“But there was a huge meeting. Oh,\nthere were loads and loads of us.\n•What can we do?’ we asked ourselves\nand each other. To help the Fairy\nQueen\'s Concert we surely must, but\nwhat will we do?’\n“Finally one little Locust, named\nLarry Locust, spoke up. ‘I have an\nidea,’ he said.\n“We all crowded around Larry and\nasked him what his Idea was.\n“‘Well,’ he said, ‘lf we all practice\nto sing quite a soft song and always\nremember to keep down our voices so\nthey won’t be too loud I think we’ll\nhave what the Fairy Queen wants.’\n“So we practiced and practiced all\nthat afternoon. When evening cama\nwe all took our places at the concert —\nthat Is—we had It In the early eve\nning.\n“We sat In front of the Katydids\nand all the other creatures sat around.\nWell, when the Fairy Queen heard us\nsinging softly and sweetly, and when\nshe heard our parts by ourselves she\nwas delighted.\n“‘Always sing like that,’ she cried;\n‘yes, always sing those sweet, low\nnotes of yours.’\n“We were so pleased and we have\nalways kept to that same kind of sing\ning. The fairy Queen liked the Katy\ndids —you mustn’t for a moment think\nshe didn’t—but she thought It would\nbe nice if we had our own kind of\nsinging, our own little songs, so there’d\nne the music of the Meadow Locusts,\ntoo.\n“Wasn’t that a good idea of Lar\nrys?” Mrs. Locust asked.\n“A most marvelous idea,” said Mil\nlie. “Is that my Uncle Larry?"\n“The very one,” said Mother Locust.\n“I must tell you, too,, now that the\nstory time is over, a little of the his\ntory of the Insect family, for we must\nhave the history of our people and all\npeoples, or rather, all insects, in our\nlessons.\n“There Is the flying grasshopper,\ncolored like the ground, that Is, the\ncolor of pebbles and stones.

He goes with some of the In\nsects where It Is very, very warm. He\nreally is a nearer relative of the Crab\nfamily. I’m glad to say.\n"But I think we’ll have our lesson,\ncontinued another day. Just now let\nus sing and thank the Fairy Queen and\ndear Larry Locust, who helped to gWe\nus a song, like the song of the Katy\ndid family, but still a song all, all our\nown.”\nFor His Mother.\nLittle Jack\'s mother was very fond\nof flowers, and he delighted in bring\ning them to her.
