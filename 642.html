The tunnel\nof the Sweepstakes Mining company\nhas cut the vein at a depth of 280\nfeet below the bottom of the old shaft.\nThe ledge where tapped is five feet\nacross and carries eight per cent cop\nper. An average sample of the full\nwidth of five feet gave a value of $42\na ton.\nThe old shaft was down 130 feet.\nThe new strike therefore is at a depth\nof 410 feet. This proves conclusive\nly that the ledges at Bullion do go\ndown.\nThe vein is the contact between\nlime and porphyry.\nThe Sweepstakes company has com\npleted their wagon road and ore bins\nand will commence regular shipments\nto the Garfield smelter at once.\nThe news of the strike produced a\njoyful feeling in Bullion. The camp\nis taking on new life.\nMr. McConaghy, manager of the\nSweepstakes company, is the man who\ndeveloped the Gold Coin mine at Crip\nple Creek. He was in charge of that\nproperty for a number of years.\nFor the last four years he has been\nmanage^- of the Sweepstakes company\nat Bullion. He has shown great faith\nIn the old camp and deserves all the\ngood fortune that has come to bis\ncompany.\nMr. McConaghy says that Bullion\nhas hardly yet been scratched and will\nprove to be one of the best districts\nin the state.\nA. W. Hesson, J. J. Hylton and\nThomas Hunter are the owners of the\nproperty in which the strike was\nmade. The Sweepstakes company is\noperating under a lease and bond.\nThere are ten Gets of leasers at\nwork on different properties in Bul\nlion, and there are two companies do\ning development work.\nThe outlook for the camp with the\npresent prices for metals is very\nbright. The strike in the Sweep\nstakes tunnel no doubt will stimulate\nother development.\nThe people of Bullion are to be con\ngratulated. The camp will yet let the\nworld know it is on the map.\nGARCIA HIS NO\nTRACE OF THIEVES\nSheriff\'s Office Is Working On a Clue\nto the Thieves That Broke\nInto Garcia\'s Store\nMr. Garcia ahs no trace of the\nthieves that broke into his store Mon\nday night and stole some two hun\ndred dollars worth of headstalls and\nother goods.\nThe matter is now in the hands of\nSheriff Harris who is following up cer\ntain clues.\nHowever, Mr. Garcia as serene as\never is devoting all his time to the\nnew race track and county fair\ngrounds and letting the officers of the\nlaw look after this burglary matter.\nThe race track was completed yes\nterday. Work on the grand stand will\nbegin within a day or two.\nThe concrete fence is also complet\ned. Mr. Garcia feels whatever may\nhappen to his store that no one will\nsteal this concrete fence.\nAnd it is now so well braced with\ncross abutments that he thinks no\nworkman can again pull it down.\nThe work on the stables that will\nshelter the blooded race horses that\nwill be here for the Rodeo in Sep\ntember will also start this week\nThese stables will be completed in\ntime to receive the horses and let\nthem rest up before the Rodeo opens\nthe 6tli of September.\nAll will be in readiness for the op\nening day and the fourth annual\nRodeo promises to be the most suc\ncessful ever held.\nO\nB.

This immense ani\n! nial was pushed from a tree by o\nj half breed Indian, who armed with a\nI small stick fought fifty feet from the\nground. The final action of the cap\nture took place in a mountain stream\nwhere the men, waist deep in the ice\ncold water succeeded in securely\nroping it.\nThis is all faithfully recorded in\nSalisbury\'s wild life pictures that are\ncoming to the Bradley Theater to\nnight.\nAnother lion is pulled from a tree by\nthe. tail within a few feet of the\ncamera and several wild cats are\nroped and captured.\nThese pictures of our rapidly dis\nappearing wild life are full of tha\n"punch" that goes direct to the heart\nof the nature lover. Big trout are\ncaught before your eyes, quail and\npheasants are shot over the champion\ndogs of the west, the life of the trout\nshown from egg to matured fish and\na sensational goose shot over the\nchampion pointer dogs of the west.\nHundreds of other scenes are shown\nall in moving pictures and they are\nso entirely different from anything\never shown before, that the "punch"\'\nis irresistible. It is imposible to dup\nlicate many of these pictures and to\nmiss them will be a misfortune.\nThese pictures will be shown at the\nBradley Theater tonight only.\nO\nRev.

It says:\n"The German-Americans were solid\nly against Mr. Bryan when Mr. Bryan\nwas wrong. The German- Americans\nare solidly for Mr. Bryan when Mr.\nBryan ij^ right."\nOf course this means that the Ger\nman-Americans are for Mr.. Bryan\nwhen Mr. Bryan is for Germany.\nThe Fatherland also says of the\nGerman-Americans, "They are against [\nMr. Wilson now because Mr. Wilson\nis In the wrong." ?\nAnd the reason Mr. Wilson is in |\nthe wrong is because he Is not trying\nto construe international law In the |\naid of Germany.\nWhale the German- Americans de- 1\nmand was expressed in resolution IX ;\nat the Madison Square Garden meet\ning of June 26ili to welcome Mr. Bry-|\nan. It reads as follows:\n"That the interests of the people of\nthe United States and of humanity\ndemaud the cessation of the exporta\ntion from our shores of arms and am\nmunition for the warring nations of |\nEurope."\nTlie Fatherland further says, "We\ndemand that the government of the\nUnited States place an embargo on\nthe exportation of arms and munitions |\nof war."\nThe reason the German-Americans\'\ndemand this is because it would aid \\\nGermany.\nIf such an embargo was enforced It j\nwould menu that no horses and no\nwheat could be exported from Amer- 1\nica. These are munitions of war.\nThis would paralize the trade of the\nUnited States. But wou\'d the Father\nland object if Germany was so situ- 1\nated as to get her share of these\nmunitions?\nThe Fatherland of course aproveB of\nBryan\'s resignation and says, "Mr.\nBryan\'s resignation has crystallized\nthe pence sentiment in this country. \'\nThe whole thing in a ntushell Is that :\ntho German-Americans which claim to\nnumber three million voters are de\ntermined to use Bryan to defeat the\npresident for renomlnation.\nCan tiuy succeed?\nLACK OF SHIPS\nCAUSES DEPRESSION.\nWE expected grent things from the]\nPanma canal. But just as the canal\nwas completed came the great Euro\npean war and wiped many ships from\nthe sens.\nThis in the opinion of the Pacific\nflual Press of San Francisco is the i\ncause of the present depression in |\nagricultural products. It says:\n""Lack of ships is responsible very!\nlargely for low prices of farm products |\nnow. With this In view, ns well as,\nother purposes, the San Francisco!\nChamber of Commerce has adopted |\nresolutions addressed to tlie president,\nto the secretary of commerce, and to l\nthe chambers of commerce of all other)\nAmerican cities, urging their help In\nsecuring the appointment of a commis\nsion of practical shipping men to study |\nthe shipping laws of foreign countries\nand devise laws which would be fair\nto all parlies and yet Increase the)\nnumber of ships sailing under the\nAraericnn tlag and thus unavailable\nfor war purposes of foreign nations\njust when we need them most to carry\nour farm products across the sea."\nTHE government is sending out its |\nannual warning in regard to forest\nfires. It is estimated that last year I\nforest fires burned over six million\nacres with a total loss of almost ten\nmillion dollars. II Is said that more\nthan half the fires are due to careless- 1\nness of campers, sawmills, locomo\ntives and incendiaries and are entire\nly preventable.

It has been quite generally be\nlieved that the courts have been re\nsponsible for the delay. Judge Far\nrlngton makes it plain that the fault\nlies at the doors of the city and the\nSpring Valley company. At any rate,\nit was a rather nervy request on the\npart of the Spring Valley company\nthat it be permitted to use money be\nlonging to the rate payers, and Judge\nFarrinpton is to be commended for\nhaving refused the request."\no\n02140\nNOTICE FOR PUBLICATION\nElko, Nevada, Land Office\nJuly 2nd, 1915.\nNOTICE Is hereby given that\nJames Russell, Jr., of Deetb, County\nof Elko, State of Nevada, has filed in\nthis office his application to enter un\nder the provisions of Sec. 2306 or 2307\nRevised Statutes of the United States,\nthe fallowing described land, vlx:\nThe SW?4 of the NW>4 of Sec. 15,\nTownship 42 North, Range 58 East,\nM.

The comments of W. J.

He adheres loyally to Presi\ndent Wilson. Thus he aims to hold\ntogether the democratic party.\nAt the same time Bryan virtually\nadvises acquiescence in the German\nproposal for the licensing of Ameri\ncan ships to travel the open high\nseas. This would be a surrender of\nthe position taken by President Wil\nson.\nBryan\'s statement is most \'signifi\ncant. It is bound to please the Ger\nmans. Thus It will hold the Ger\nman-American vote.\nBryan says, "It is not a sacrifice of\nrights to avoid unnecessary risks.\'\'\nThis means that he takes the Uernian\nview that Americans should keep out\nof the war zone.\nThe Reno Journal strongly indorses\nthe attitude of Bryan. It says, "Tlis\nsanity of his comment will make Mr.\nBryan\'s strong hold on the people yet\nstronger."\nWe no longer need mince matters.\nThe lines are being clearly drawn for\nnext year\'s campaign. It will bo Bry\nan against Wilson for the democratic\nnomination for president.\nBryan may deny that he is after\nthe nomination. But he is a receptive\ncandidate.
