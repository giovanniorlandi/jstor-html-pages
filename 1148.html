Lyons,\nregister of the treasury, a*id John\nC. Ganeev, recorder of deeds for\nthe District of Columbia, who\nbrought a colored female cousin\nwith him. One of the women\npresent, with a complexion as\ndark as the inside of a stall at\nmidnight, made a generous dis\nplay of neck and shoulders,\naround which an evening gown\nwas daintly built.\nThe effect of large dark flesh\nin the middle of a luxurious gar\nden ot pink and white woman\nhood was decidedly novel.\nSoutherners Left the Room.\nSeveral of the Southern guest>\nwent out of doors.\nIt is said that the very air of\nthe executive mansion was warm\nand heavy with the incense of\nthe Roosevelt devotion to humani\nty regardless of race, and that\nthe “strange invisible perfume"\narrested and puzzled wayfarers\npassing on the avenue.\nEthnologically speaking, it\nwas the most memorable recep\ntion of the season.\nIt was not the first time a\nnegro was ever at a W bite House\nreception, but it is the first oc\ncasion at which a decided percent\nacre of the guests were so con\nspicuously black and white as to\nattract attention and to create in\nvidious sentiment and remark.\nLadies Turn Their Faces.\nSeveral ladies, it must be said,\nturned aside and would not not ice\nthe darkies.\nLyons soon followed and joined\nhis party in the oast room, where\nnearly a thousand guests were\nassembled.\nThe negroes betook themselves\nto a conspicuous corner and re\nmained to themselves for the re\nmainder of the evening.\nAmong the other guests the\nstorm was brewing as the negroes\nwere marching down the line\ntoward the president.\nOne Southern congressman,\nwho had his wife and daughter\nWith him, observed the blacks\nahead ol him. He left the line\nTHE STARKVILLE NEWS\nSTARKVILLE. MISS., FRIDAY, JAN UARY 30, 1903\nwith the ladies, hurried to the\ncloak room, and after securing\ntheir wraps, left the place.\nOthers followed them rapidly\nuntil two score or more had\nwit hdra wn.\nTo those who stayed, llie pres\nence of the negroes seemed to\nact as a damper and tiie recep\ntion was noticeably Hat and de\nvoid of the usual animation and\npleasurahle excitement.\nS11’k en in(; Disu.ust Feet.\nThe truth is, the sensation’s\ncaused by Booker T. Washington\nlunch, with the President was a\nmere ripple by the side of the\nseething disgust with which\nmany people saw others have\nsince heard of the presence at\nthe While House of a number ol\nnegro men and women in even\ning dress.\nThere the negroes stood among\nthe white ladies and gentlemen in\nthe densely crowded rooms, and\nthose who were there say they\nnever know it to be so oppres\nsively close at a White House\nparty.\nThe negroes were among the\ntirst after the judiciary to grasp\nthe president\'s hand and receive\nhis cordial greetings. Then\nthey went to a corner. Here\nthey were much observed anti\ncarefully kept at a distance by a\nnumber of guests who hurried\naway from the place. There\nwas an early rapid thinning out\nof the crowd, so that I lie negro\nguests were enabled to make\ntheir exit without any jostling by\nthe white.\nFalling Off in Attendance.\nIt is predicted that hereafter\nthere will be a noticeable falling\notf in the number of those who\nattend the Roosevelt receptions.\nWhite House functionaries at\nthe beginning of the season caus\ned to be published in the local\npapers here that great care would\nbe exercised in looking alter the\npersonel of those invited to re\nceptions, and this explains why\nin envelopes containing invita\ntions there would be cards in\nscribed “not transferrable." Ac\ncordingly, the turnkeys at the\ndoors were posted as to who were\ninvited and knew the guests,\nwhite and black, for the genuine\narticle as they passed within.\nSenator Tillman\'s Opinion.\nSenator Tillman, of South\nCarolina, said to-day he had to\nthink hard for words to express\nhimself, but he ventured the re\nmarks that the reception sug\ngested a pail of milk with a tly\nin it. Northern people might\ndrink it if they pleased, but the\nSouthern people never would.\n“The thing that bothers me\nmost is that my name was print\ned this morning among the guests\npresent. The same mistake was\nmade on the occasion of the\ndiplomatic reception. I have\nnot been to the White House. I\nnever expect to go there while\nRoosevelt occupies it. Ido not\nblame any Southern man for op\nposing the practice of social\nequality, that is if he is a white\nman."\nThe name of Senator McLaurm,\nof Mississippi, was also included\nin the list of those present. He\nwas at home. He said he never\nwent to the White House except\non business, and his comment on\nthe reception he said: “Might\nnot make proper reading for\npolite society. ’’\nBlunder of Blunders.\nSenator Pelt us said: “It was\nthe blunder of blunders."\nSenator Cockrell said; “I am\nextremely sorry. We’ve had\nenough trouble already.’’\nSenator Carmack said\': “My\nremarks would not be til for pub\nlication."\nMany thought at first that the\nnegroes were from some of the\noff-color foreign countries, like\nHayti, until they realized they\nwere everyday negroes, and\nSouthern States negroes at that.\nThe feeling among Soul burners\nin Washington is that President\nRoosevelt has again aggravated\nthe ugliness of the race question,\nwhich he might easily have\navoided were lie not genuinely\nagreeable to negro equality.\nRepresentative Brazeale, of\nLouisiana, said: “I was greatly\nsurprised. Mr. Roosevelt is do\ning himself a great deal of harm.\nHe is lowering himself in the\nestimation of Southern gentle\nmen.’’\nCheaper Production\nof Turpentine.\nNew Method of Tapping Pines\nBring a Larger Yield and\nBetter Grades of\nRosin.\nTurpentine operators will be\nfurnished soon, by the Bureau of\nForestry, with a circular of in\nsi ructions and with personal help\nfor the use of the new cup and\ngutter system of turpentining,\nwhich has been proved so suc\ncessful. The experiments of the\nBureau of Forestry, at OcilhV\nGa., conducted by Dr. Charles |\nH. Herty, have shown the great\ni\nsuperiority of the cup and gutter\nsystem over the old method of\nboxing pines. Trees treated by\nthe new system have yielded -3\npercent more turpentine than\nboxed trees. Moreover, only the\nhighest grades of rosin were pro\nduced. The increased yield for\nthe tirst year alone has been\nfound sufficient to pay for the\nnew equipment and to furnish a\nprofit besides. An advantage lor\nthe timber owner to consider is\nthat the cup and gutter system\ndoes a way with thei nj u rious box\nand thus lessens greatly the\ndamage done to the trees.\nThe superiority of the new\nmethod of turpentining is so evi\ndent that many operators who\nare acquainted with Dr. Herty’s\nexperiments are eager to adopt\ni . Several potteries for the\nmanufacture of earthen cups\nhave been established; in a short\ntime the new system will prob\nably he in general use through\nout the turpentine belt.\nTo make the benefits of the\nnew method directly available\nthe Bureau of Forestry, besides\nissuing a circular of instructions,\noffers without cost, the assistance\nof Dr. Herty, will personally\ndirect in the Held the installment\nof the new system.\nThe largest gun ever made was\ngiven a successful trial at New\nYork Saturday.

ITo\n\\ ivied He is Convinced of the Senate\'s\nCower to Act.\nWashington, Jan. 25. —South-\nern interest should be alive just\nnow to the reciprocity treaty\nwith Cuba which is pending in\nthe senate. No measure in re\ncent years has materially affect\ned the South as this treaty, for\nit offers anew market for South\nern products and will, if ratified\nprove of immense advantages to\nthe Southern States.\nThe treaty proposes to lower\nthe duty on nearly every South\nern product going to Cuba and\nnearly every Cuban product com\ning into the South. Rice, cotton\ngoods, na\\ al stores and cattle\nare especially favored in the\ntreaty and producers of these\ncommodities arc watching the\nnational assembly with keen in\nterest to see what will lx* done\nwith the treaty.\nSenator Clay of Georgia is one\nof the strong advocates of the\ntreaty. There is one feature of\nthe proposed legislation on which\nlie is doubtful. He is not entirely\nsatisfied that the right to make\nthese commercial treaties rest\nwith the senate alone. If, in the\ndiscussion which will surely arise\non this point, Senator Clay is\nconvinced that the senate has\nthis right he will vote for ratifi\ncation of the treaty.\nIn analyzing the treaty Sena\ntor Clay said:\n“The treaty provides that all\narticles of merchandise that are\nthe products of the soil or the\nindustry of the republic of Cuba\nshall be imported into the United\nStates at a reduction of 20 per\ncent. In other words, in trading\nwith us, shall enjoy a reduction\nof 20 per cent in customs duties,\na reduction enjoyed by no other\nforeign power.\n“This treaty also provides that\nthe citizens of the United States\nin selling goods and merchandise\nin Cuba, shall receive likewise a\nreduction of per cent in cus\ntoms duties. This gives the\nUnited States an advantage of\n20 per cent over England, Ger\nmany, France, or any other for\neign power, in trading with\nCuba.\n“This reduction is general in\nits nature and applies to all arti\ncles going from our country into\nCuba. The treaty goes still\nfurther and makes a reduction of\n25 per cent in customs duties on\nmachinery, iron, steel, glass,\ncotton and manufacturers thereof,\nfish, articles of pottery and earth\nenware going from this country\ninto Cuba.\n“Schedule B of the treaty pro\nvides for a reduction of 36 per\ncent on butter, alcoholic bever\nages. cider, mineral water, hemp,\nmusical instruments, writing\npaper, cutlery, hoots, shoes and\nslippers, gold and silver plated\nware, etc., going from this coun\ntry into Cuba.\n“Schedule C. which is a favor\nable clause of the treaty, pro\nvides for a reduction of 40 per\ncent on manufacturers of cotton\nknitted goods and all manufact\nures of cotton not included in\nthe proceeding schedules, cheese,\nfruits, soaps, umbrellas, dexter-\nIne and glucose, watches, wool\nand manufactures thereof, rice\nand beef cattle.\n“These articles sold by our\npeople and exported to Cuba,\nwill receive a reduction of 4o per\n(tent. Cuba is likewise to enjoy\nthe same benefit at our hands for\nthis is intended to be a reciprocal\ntreaty.\n*Tn my opinion this treaty will\nresult in great benefit to our\npeople. We will enjoy in our\ntrade relations with Cuba reduc\ntions of tarriff duties which no\nother country enjoys. My col\nleague, who is a member of the\ncommittee on foreign affairs,\ntried to amend the treaty so as\nto place lumber, naval stores and\ntobacco under the favored clause\nof the treaty. I very much favor\nthese amendments. I would be\nglad to see this treaty become a\nlaw\' and shall vote for its ratifi\ncation, presided I am convinced\nthat the president and the senate\nwithout the concurrence of the\nhouse, have the right to make a\ntreaty fixing our commercial re\nlations. This power has been\ndenied by some of our ablest con\nstitutional lawyers# notably Mr.\nChoate, and Randolph Tucker,\nwho was for a long time member\nand chairman of the judiciary\ncommittee of the house.\n“This will he the real point of\ncontention in the discussion to go\non in the senate when this treaty\nshall come up for ratification.\nThe treaty as it now stands\nmakes a reduction of 45 per cent\nfor manufactures of cotton, rice\nand beef cattle, and I am anxious\nto see lumber, cottonseed oil,\ntobacco, and naval stores placed\nupon upon the same footing.”\nPointed Paragraphs.\nShort-sighted people are natur\nally close observers.\nIf a man has neither friends\nnor enemies he has lived in vain.\nWhen the average man tells a\nlie he is in a hurry to prove it.\nIf you would retain your friends\ndon\'t remind them of their faults.\nIt is a wise woman who can\nsmile at a compliment and then\nforget it.\nAmateur photographers are\nwilling to take anything except\nadvice.\nLeave your worries at home\nwhen you travel.

Wood will read with regret\nhis card in another column in\nwhich he expresses his declina\ntion to further prosecute his as\npirations to the office of State\nSenator. Col. Wood is a gentle\nman of the “old school,” a loyal\nfriend and his record as a legis\nlator ir 188- and 1888 is sufficient\nindorsement, if any was needed,\nof the character of a senator that\nhe would have made his district\nWe feel that the people have been\ndeprived of the opportunity to\nvote for a good man.\nIn another column will be found\nthe announcement of Mr. J.

The long overlooked\nSouth is to have her delayed\ngrand inning. She will be the\n“new south\'’indeed.\nFor almost a generation the\nSouth bravely delved in 1 lie\ndebris and ashes of the civil war\nto clear the right of way for the\ngolden car of progress hitherto\nrolling undeviatingly westward.\nHad there been no war, in all\nprobability the center of popula\ntion would now be within the\nSouthern States. The South\nhad more than the West genial\nand seasonable climate, unde\nveloped natural resources, an\nabundance of cheap land susccp\ntible of high productivity, great\nmarkets at her door, and plenty\nof room for home-seeking mil\nlions, But the South was under\na ban. The emigrant tide swept\nby her to the West, ignorant of\nthe vastly better opport uni ties to\nbe found nearer home. The\nWest tilled up and the South lay\nfallow for the few who knew the\n“ground floor" when they were\non it.\nThe opening’ of the Panama\ncanal to the world\'s traffic will\nmore directly and largely benefit\nthe cotton belt than any other\nlarge section of the country.\nThe vast current of overland\ntraffic to the Pacific will be in\na large degree diverted to the\nSouth Atlantic and gulf seaboard,\nstimulating southern railroad\nbuilding proportionately and\nbuilding at southern harbors\ncities that will rival the greatest\nof the north. The whole south\nwill be transformed into a teem\ning industrial community, where\nthe manufacturer has every ad\nvantage of convenient, cheap raw\nmaterial and coal, unequaled\nfacilities to compete with his\nrivals elsewhere at home or\nabroad, and a short haul to ship\nboard or the great continental\ncenters population. Such tre\nmendous industrialism will create\na magnificient home market, and\nthe husbandman no less than the\ntradesman and labor in all its\nbranches will prosper. The South\nwill become the workshop and\nmarket place of the western\nhemisphere.\nThis being the fact—and no\nspeculative probability could bo\nmore self-evident from environ\ning conditions—the appropriate\nness of our paraphrase of Horace\nGreeley’s famous advice is ap\nparent. The young man who has\nhis fortune to hew out with his\nstrong hands and plucky heart,\ncan emigrate to no field of scanti\nly exploited possibilities to begin\nto compare with the Southern\nstates of the union. Here he\nwill find his opportunity, if the\nstuff is in him, and a cordial\nwelcome.\nThe guide posts of future ma\nterial supremacy are pointing\nSouth.—Atlanta Constitution.\nIQ OTTIE3\nFriends and Patrons:\nWe are in a position to show\nnow during this tall, an ele\ngant line of\nStaple and Fancy Dry Goods.
