The books will be closed\nat that time. "The exercise of the\nright to franchise on election day is\na duty every Idaho citizen owes to\nhis state and nation," Governor\nMoore said in his Registration Day\nproclamation.\nThe following article, reprinted\nfrom Colliers, will prove an inspira\ntion to many who have thus far neg\nlected their duty in this regard:\n"We Americans believe in major\nity rule. We\'re not practicing it.\nOur forefathers placed in our\nhands a mighty weapon tfl make ma\njority rule effective. We\'re not us\ning it.\nThat weapon is the ballot. What\nare we doing with it?\nIn each national election since\n1896 the proportion of voters has\ndwindled. In 1896, 80 per cent of\nthose qualified to vote did vote; in\n1900, 73 per cent; in 1908, 66 per\ncent; in 1912, 62 per cent; in 1920,\nless than 50 per cent. Four years\nago 54,421,832 Americans could\nhave voted, but only 26.786,753 did\nso.\nSuch is the descending curve of\nAmerican democracy. Unscrupulous\npoliticians get what they want by\nherding their maees of unthinking\nvoters to the polls. Isn\'t it time\nmore thinking voters were heard\nfrom ?\nRegister! Vote!

In\nnumerous instances, sales were made\nto people who did not stop to con-\nsider that the general practice of\nbuying ifrom the peddler would ulti-\nmately drive every business house\nfrom the city. Our local stores can\nsupply anything that is needed in\nevery day life at a price that will\nmeet that of the peddler and by pat-\nronizing them a patron can see what\nthey are buying and be certain that\nthey are getting their money\'s worth.\nThe goods are delivered forthwith\nwhile if you patronize the peddler you\nhave to wait for several weeks and\nbesides take the risk of never getting\nit.\nIt hardly seems fair to local busi\nness houses that outside people\nshould be permitted to come into the\ncity and solicit premiscously with\nout the payment of a single cent for\nthe maintenance of the city, while to\ndo business every businessman In the\ncity is required to keep up his pro\nrata of taxes.
