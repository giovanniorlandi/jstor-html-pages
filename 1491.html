Lawrence- Advertising\n9 East Fifth Street o&f FU-0811\nA a» W%\nAnti-Poll Tax\nBill Must Pass\nOne subject on which all workers are\nagreed on which the American Federation\nof Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organi\nzations, and the Railroad Brotherhoods see\neye to eye—is that the anti-poll tax bill,\nHR 7, must pass the Senate at this session\nof Congress. Yet how can this bill be so im\nportant to all branches of labor—to all\nAmericans throughout the nation when\nonly eight Southern states make payment\nof a poll tax a prerequisite to voting.\nConsider first the history of the poll tax.\nThe idea of taxing the right to vote was in\ntroduced in the Southern states in the 1890\'s\nto stem the rise of the Populist Party. Its ef\nfect was immediately felt. The vote in these\nstates was cut as much as fifty-six per cent.\nToday this situation still prevails. While we\nare engaged in a war for democracy, ten\nmillion citizens, both Negro and white, in\neight Southern states, are effectively dis\nfranchised by the poll tax requirements.\nAxis propaganda, aimed at our colored al\nlies, makes much of the fact that we at\nhome keep Negroes from voting. Congress\nitself felt the sting of shame when, a year\nago, it pased a law for absentee voting by\nsoldiers in Federal elections and stated in\nit that no state poll tax should bar them from\nvoting. What Congress has done to prevent\nthe eight poll-tax states from robbing sol\ndiers of their rights as citizens, it has the\npower to do—and should do—to protect the\nvoting rights of farm laborers, industrial\nworkers, and all others who make up the\n10,000,000 disfranchised citizens in the\nSouth.\nThe issue for American labor, however,\nis more than a matter of democratic prin\nciple alone. It is a matter of self-protection.\nAmerican labor knows who have been its\nworst enemies in Congress. They are, for\nthe most part, the senators and representa\ntives elected from poll tax states. These\nCongressmen are elected year after year by\nthe one or two or five per cent of the voters\nwho have the wherewithal to pay the poll\ntaxes. They represent the interests, not of\nall the people, but of the one or two or five\nper cent who voted for them. Because the\nnumber of voters is so small, it is simple for\nthe politicians of the poll-tax states to es\ntablish tight, unbeatable political machines.\nBecause the poll tax representatives are re\nelected much more often than are Con\ngressmen from other states, they acquire\nseniority in the Senate and the House of\nRepresentatives. Since membership on\nHouse and Senate committees depends on\nDayton Union Newt\nseniority, Congressmen from the poll-tax\nstates have a stranglehold grip on many all\nimportant committees. And almost always\nthey cast their votes against labor.\nLabor knows that there is only one way to\ncorrect this situation. To have a "good"\nCongress, America must have a democratic\nCongress, in whose election all citizens—in\ncluding 10,000,000 non-poll tax payers in\neight Southern states—have the right to\nvote.\nThe poll tax congressmen know that the\nabolition of the poll tax will spell the doom\nof their oligarichic power. That is why, in\nthe last session of Congress, when the House\nof Representatives finally approved an anti\npoll tax bill, some of the Southern senators,\nignoring the urgencies of the war, filibus\ntered shamefully against the bill, and killed\nit, without allowing it to come to a vote.\nAgain, at this session of Congress, the\nanti-poll tax bill, HR 7, has passed the\nHouse of Representatives. Once again, it is\nstuck in the Senate. As part of their stall\ning tactics, the Senate Judiciary Commit\ntee, instead of reporting out the bill at once,\nhas arranged for a two-day debate on its\nconstitutionality, despite the fact that pro\nlonged hearings were held last year on all\nphases of the bill. And already, in anticipa\ntion of the bill\'s coming up on the floor of\nthe Senate, Senator Bilbo of Mississippi has\nthreatened to filibuster for the rest of this\nsession if necessary—in order to keep the\nbill from coming to a vote.\nLabor cannot afford to let this happen. It\nneed not happen if labor brings enough pres\nsure to bear. All units of organized labor\nmust write and send delegations to the\nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Commit\ntee urging that HR 7 be reported out favor\nably, without further delay—and also to\ntheir own senators urging these senators\nnot only to vote for the bill when it comes\nup, but to be on the floor and vote repeated\nly for cloture to kill the filibuster the poll\ntaxers threaten.\no\nFuture of Price Control\nWhat is the future of price control? Will\nit succeed or fail? No man knows. Certainly\nwe cannot prevent inflation by price control\nalone. It is but one of the measures in the\ngeneral program of stabilization. But for\nmany months it was the only measure that\nwas employed. It was not until October,\n1942, that wage costs were subjected to ad\nministrative control that it became possible\nto regulate the prices of foodstuffs. It was\nnot until April, 1943, that the movement\nof manpower from essential industries was\nbrought under general supervision. Taxa\ntion still falls far short of closing the infla\ntionary gap. Price control, if it is to be fully\neffective, must be further implemented by\nstandardization, by subsidization, by concen\ntration, and by other measures which are as\nyet undeveloped, none of which are likely\nto be welcome to men who are accustomed\nto the way of a free economy.\nIn the last analysis, the future of prices\ndepends upon the American people. If they\nwant control, they can have it. If they want\ninflation, they can have it. The difficulty is\nthat they want both. Every man thinks of\nhimself first as a seller, and only secondarily\nas a buyer. He wants control for the things\nhe buys, and inflation for the things he sells.\nThe controls which protect the prices he\npays, he accepts as a matter of course. The\ncontrols which affect the prices he changes,\nhe fights. Every pressure which is brought\nagainst the Office of Price Administration\nby a trade group is a pressure for the relaxa\ntion of controls. If we were to yield to these\npressures, one by one, every one of our\nceilings would be raised, not once, but\nagain and again. The battle against infla\ntion would be lost. If we stand fast, we lay\nourselves open to attack.\nIn the very nature of the case, we can\nnot expect to satisfy our customers. If we\nreduce a ceiling, it is said that we are at\ntacking the profit system, and destroying\nthe incentive to engaged in business. If we\nrefuse to raise a ceiling, it is said that we\nare impeding production, imposing undue\nhardship on producers, and driving small\nbusiness to the wall. If we raise a ceiling, it\nis said that we have liberalized our policies,\nand that our controls have broken down.\nYou cannot expect to meddle with a matter\nwhich so intimately affects the daily lives\nof the American people as does the structure\nof prices, and get much of anything for\nyour pains but criticism. And when we say\nthis, we are not asking for sympathy. We\nare bowing to the inevitable.\nThe plain fact of the matter is this: If the\nAmerican business community really pre\nfers relative stability to headlong inflation,\nit will have to reconcile itself to the fact\nthat price control is a bitter dose. It will\nhave to hold its nose and take its medicine.\nThe remedy may be bad. The disease would\nbe worse.\nWe do not mean, by this, to say that we\nare infallible. Far from it. If we have made\nmistakes, we will correct them. If we have\ncreated hardships, we will relieve them. We\nare willing to be reasonable. We are not\nwilling to be weak.\nWe said that the future of prices depends\nupon the American people, and it is the\nAmerican people who are building the price\npanel organization in our local War Price\nand Rationing Boards. The price panels\nwant control and they intend that we have\nprice control, and they also intend to de\nvelop in their communities a consciousness\non the part of the consumers and retailers\nthat they are buyers first and then sellers.\nBy being alert to the cost of merchandise\npurchased, retailers needn\'t worry about\ntheir margin of profit, for the majority of\nregulations at the retail level permit the\nretailer to have a percentage of profit or\nallow him to charge a dollar-and-cent figure\nwhich is the result of incorporating a per\ncentage profit.\nPrice panels are responsible for educating\ntheir communities on the price regulations\nand the need for price control, and having\nthat responsibility, they recognize the im\nportance of representing the conscientious\nand patriotic retailer in his fight against\nunscrupulous operators. They also have the\nresponsibility of acquainting the community\nwith the details of price regulations, partic\nularly on food at this time, and of protecting\nthe consumer in the community against ex\nploitation by these same unscrupulous op\nerators during times of scarcity.\nAs a result, our price panels, with their\norganized groups of price panel assistants,\nare carrying the banner of price control\nwhich is another term for "protecting our\nway of life," and marching along with them\nare more than 90 per cent of the merchants,\nand tagging along after them, but rapidly\nincreasing in number, are the consumers in\nthe community.\nL.

The poll tax as a\ncondition of voting in federal elec\ntions covers 10,000,000 Negro and\nwhite people in seven poll-tax\nstates and will be abolished if the\nSenate passes HR 7. The bill was\npreviously passed by the House.\nIn 1942, an average of only 3\nper cent of the population in Ala\nbama, Arkansas, Georgia, Missis\nsippi, South Carolina, Texas and\nVirginia, participated in Congres\nsional election. The poll tax pre\nvented the others from voting.\nThe average in non-poll tax states\nwas 25 per cent.\nMississippi is an example of\nhow the poll tax works. A poll\ntax of $2.00 must be paid to vote,\n$4.00 if it was not paid the year\nbefore. Average income in the\nstate is $203.00 a year.

Go+wt*f\n9nduAtnial l/inion\nQauwcil l\\laUi\nFollowing statements are ex\ncerpts from the speech of Philip\nMurray, president of the Congress\nof Industrial Organizations, in out\nlining the wage policies of CIO.\nI think it was the universal\nconsensus of opinion of all the\npeople throughout the country, or\nat least the overwhelming ma\njority of the people in this nation\nof ours that when our nation be\ncame involved in war and blood\nhad to be spilled and lives had to\nbe lost, there would be a real\nequality of sacrifice and that no\none individual or group of indi\nviduals would take advantage of\nthis thing we call a global blood\nbath to extort profit or to filch\nmoney from the public pocketbook\nat the expense of the war effort\nRecords produced and pre\nsented to various congressional\ncommittees by both the Treasury\nDepartment of the United States\nand the Office of Price Adminis\ntration in the course of congres\nsional hearings upon the funda\nmental question of taxes reveal\nthe rather astonishing fact that\na few people and a great many\ncorporations were extracting more\nprofit out of this war and out of\n.American industry than has ever\nbeen taken out of the public pock\netbook at any time in the history\nof the United States. There is\nsomething radically wrong with\nan economic situation that permits\nthe development of conditions\nsuch as that.\nWage Policies\nThe wage policies of the Fed\neral Government are wrong, not\nonly in so far as they freeze under\nthese conditions the possibility of\nAmerican wage earners adjusting\ntheir conditions so as to be able to\nmeet their country\'s war needs, but\nto maintain their families in a\nstate of health and decency, main\ntain the workers\' morale to a point,\nand their health to a point, where\nthey will be able to report daily\nto their respective occupations and\ntrades and produce the necessary\ngoods to keep the war going on.\nThere is no desire on the part\nof the CIO or any one of its mil\nlions of members to derive any\nkind of special privilege out of\nthis situation in which our country\nnow finds itself. All that they\nwant is enough food to provide the\nnecessary nutrition to keep them\ngoing, enough clothing, enough\nmedicine, enough medical care,\nand a little home to protect and\nshelter both them and their fam\nilies.\nCIO Program\nThere is nothing in that sort\nof a program which \'contemplates\nextortion or prosecutes selfish in\nterests. It is merely a desire, as\nexpressed in this resolution, on\nthe part of the CIO to get out of\nthis economy of ours something\napproximating a square deal.\nDuring the last war no directive\nwas ever issued by the Federal\nGovernment which sought to re\nstrain the operation of a grievance\ncommittee in the correction of\nabuses or the correction of in\nequalities. This is the first time\nto my own individual knowledge\nthat the United States has ever\nundertaken the responsibility of\nregulating through the medium\nof a National War Labor Board\nthe working conditions of 55,000,\n000 workers. Now, that is an im\xad\npossible thing.\nNo board that has ever been\ncreated within the mind of man\nhas ever been able to do that any\ndo it efficiently and do it on a\npractical basis. It is just a prac\ntical and physical impossibility.\nSome leeway must be conceeded\nthe employee in the organization\nwith whom he has a collective\nbargaining contract* should be\nprivileged the right to enjoy these\nordinary collective bargaining\nrights.\nRESOLUTION\nRESOLVED, That the action of\nthe United States Employment\nService, (USES) in denying state\nments of availability and inter\narea clearances to wives, mothers\nand daughters of members of the\narmed services who desire to fol\nlow their relatives in service\nwhere they are stationed and take\nup residential employment there,\nin unfair and unjust, and con\nflicts with the interpretation of\nthe Amended Dayton Area Sta\nbilization Plan.\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,\nThat the action of the USES is\narbitrary, due to the fact that the\nDayton Area Stabilization Plan\nwas not designed to conflict with\nthe rights of American citizens,\nand is a direct violation of the\n"Bill of Rights" and the Constitu\ntion of the United States of Amer\nica.\nTHEREFORE, We, the delegates\nof the Montgomery County In\ndustrial Union Council, do pro\ntest the actions of the USES in\ndenying releases to the afore\nmentioned, and ask the War\nManpower Commission to take\nthe proper steps to rectify this\nsituation.\nReminder\nWe wish to remind the mem\nbership of all CIO loeal unions,\nthat the proper channels to take\nup their problems of rationing,\nmanpower, and other government\nal agencies, is through their\nunion. There are no agencies in\nthis area that do not have union\nrepresentation, and many hours\ncan be cut from the processes that\nmust be taken by an individual\nin his dealings with these agencies,\nsimply by using the representa\ntion we have.\nLet every member of every\nlocal union realize that the coun\ncil, as the only local representa\ntive body of CIO, is in a position\nto render these services, and that\nin so doing make stronger the\nposition of the organization for\nfurther needs. Particularly in the\nOffice of Price Administration, it\nis recognized all over the country,\nthe value of the services that are\nbeing rendered by organized labor.\nMost of the governmental agen\ncies are operated with the aid of\nvoluntary workers, with only a\nsmall part of the entire staff being\non a salary basis. Your council\nhas found all of the heads of these\nagencies appreciative of the help\nthat we have given, and always\nready to help the members of our\norganization with their problems.\nTherefore, we are advising our\nmembership to talk over their\nproblems with their union offi\ncials, who will in turn contact\nthis council for iimiirtanot ib eolv\ning\nUnemployment\nCompensation\nPayments Drop\nCOLUMBUS, O.—Continuing a\nrecord-breaking decline^ payments\nof unemployment compensation in\nOhio to $54,416 during October,\nlowest point since the state started\npaying such benefits in 1839.\nA further decrease also appears\nlikely during November. Adminis\ntrator Hugh S. Jenkins said in his\nreport to Gov. John W. Bricker.\n"A decline of both new and\ncontinued claims for compensa\ntion, which accompanied the rec\nord drop in benefits during Oc\ntober, ordinarily would be re\nflected in a lower benefit total\nthe following month."\nNew claims declined 4 per cent\nduring October to a total of only\n1,967, while compensable weeks of\nunemployment (weeks during\nwhich the claimants are entitled\nto benefits) dropped 25 per cent\nto 4,306 for the month.\nThe record low in benefit pay\nments during October was approx\nimately 88 per cent under the\nsame month a year ago, when\nbenefits totaled $472,905, Admin\nistrator Jenkins said. Compared\nwith September, 1943, the last\nprevious all-time low, benefit\npayments during October were\nmore than 20 per cent lower.\nEvery city in the state showed\na drop in compensable unem\nployment during October as com\npared with a year ago, with the\ndecreases ranging up to 100 per\ncent in a few cases and more than\n70 per cent in a majority of the\nlocalities.\nOhio\'s benefit payments for un\nemployment have now declined to\nonly 1.9 per cent of the total\namount paid in such benefits in\nthe entire United States, the ad\nministrator said. A recent com\npleted study of benefit payments\nin Ohio as compared with the en\ntire country showed that whereas\nOhio\'s payments amounted to "4.7\nper cent of the national total\nduring the "normal" year, 1940,\nthey had dropped to the 1.9 per\ncent figure during -the first nine\nmonths of this year.\nUAW\nLocal\n785\nShop News\nAccording to the provisions of\nthe new contract, which the shop\ncommittee hopes will take affect\nwithin the next sixty days, regard\nless of the classification or pres\nent wage rates established, all\nwomen workers will receive the\nsame amount of wages for various\ntypes of work as if a man were\non the job. Considering the fact\nthat approximately seventy per\ncent of the employees at Stand\nard Aircraft are women, this will\nmean a considerable increase to a\nlarge number of workers.\nMore and more as the shortage\nof manpower increases, the per\ncentage of women employees in\nindustrial plants is becoming\nlarger. Those new women em\nployees are realizing that the pro\ntection of wage standards and\nworking conditions are entirely de\npendent upon the support of a\nstrong organization, and as a nat\nural consequence, the membership\nof the local union is ever increas\ning.\nThe Shop Committee also wishes\nto take this opportunity to wel\ncome William Freeman upon his\nreturn to that body. It will also\ncome as a welcome surprise to\nhis many friends and fellow work\ners in the Standard Aircraft plant\nTFuke\nListen, my children, and you shall hear, a most peculiar tale.\nLet me tell it quickly, before it gets stale.

Silvey, secretary-treasurer of the state\norganization.\nHie meeting will open Monday\nmorning, November 22, and con\ntinue through Wednesday after\nnoon at the Deshler-Wallick Hotel\nin Columbus. Besides the officers\nreport, the convention will hear\nfrom the state Council\'s Special\nCommittee on Workmen\'s Com\npensation and it& Anti-Discrimina\ntion Committee.\nSecretary Silvey disclosed that\nCIO membership in Ohio is now\nin excess of 350,00 workers on the\njob in war plants throughout the\nState. "This figure," he said, "does\nnot include the many thousands\nof CIO members in the nation\narmed forces who are in training\ncamps and on battle fronts\nthroughout the world."\nA total of 387 local unions of 31\nnational CIO organizations are\nentitled to send delegates to the\n1943 convention in addition to 23\n.city and county CIO councils. A\nnormal attendance of 1,200 dele\ngates will be reduced because of\nwartime travel conditions to ap\nproximately 800.\nThe full strength of units af\nfiliated with the Ohio CIO Council\npermits a total of 2,278 votes to\nbe cast in the 1943 convention,\ncompared with 1544 votes in the\n1942 meeting.\nVoting is weighed according to\nmembership in the local union,\neach delegate having from one to\nfive votes. The increased voting\ncomes not only from the additional\nlocal unions but also because of\nthe increased membership of many\nlocals.\nOfficials of the national CIO\nwho will address the convention\ninclude James B. Carey, secre\ntary -treasurer Allan S. Haywood,\nvice-president and director of\n•organization J. Raymond Walsh,\ndirector of research and educa\ntion.\nGeorge L. P.

Rep.\nUAWA\nGuest\nFor this issue, and for the next\nfew weeks, this column is being\nwritten by Ray J. Quinlan, inter\nnational representative of the\nUAW, during the temporary ab\nsence of Jack Holt.\nCIO Action\nIn demanding the death of the\n"Little Steel" formula, the CIO\nconvention went on record of de\nmanding continued efforts to raise\nsubstandard wages "to mimimum\nlevels of American decency," and\ncalled for a truly stabilized na\ntional war economy. The CIO has\nled the nation during the war\nemergency in recognition of the\nnecessity for a thoroughly stabil\nized home front economy to assure\nmaintenance of morale, national\nunity, and maximum war produc\ntion for victory.\nLabor has rallied behind the\nseven-point program of President\nRoosevelt for national economic\nstabilization:. Labor has vigor\nously pointed out the absolute\nnecessity for firm action on all\nfronts if sound stabilization is to\nbe achieved, action which would\nresult in equal and impartial\nstabilization of all aspects of our\nwar economy, including prices,\nprofits, salaries and wages. Such\na program plainly requires ef\nfective control of prices, a sound\ntax system to curb high incomes\nand huge corporate profits, and\nsound wage levels which would\nassure to all workers levels of\npayment calculated to promote\nproduction, preserve health, and\nworking efficiency together with\nmorale.\nIt is unfortunate that the peoples\ndemands have not been made ef\nfective! Special interests and pres\nsures have operated, particularly\nin Congress, to prevent effective\nsteps on each of the important\nissues. The results have thus far\ncreated serious dangers of dis\nunity within the nation and a\nbroad weakening of the home\nfront American wage earners are\nnot getting enough money to pro\xad\nDayton Onion Hews\nvide proper sustenance and to\nmeet their war obligations.\nIn launching the effort lo kill\nthe "Little Steel" formula, CIO\nstill holds to a position that all of\norganized Labor is more in favor\nof a rollback of prices than an\nincrease in wages, but is equally\nas determined to have one or the\nother.\nPolitical Action\nOur primary task in the political\nfield today, is to weld the unity\nof all workers, farmers, and other\nprogressives tehind candidates,\nregardless of their political affilia\ntion, who are committed to our\npolicy of total victory and who\nfully support the measures neces\nsary to achieve that victory and to\nlay the basis for a secure, peace\nful, decent and abundant post\nwar world. Only if we succeed in\nthat task in 1944 and place in of\nfice an enlightened national gov\nernment prepared to carry for\nward this constructive program,\ncan we have any hope for a pros\nperous, decent, and secure post\nwar world.\nWhatever difference may divide\nLabor on the industrial front, the\noverwhelming majority of the\nmembership and leadership of\nevery branch of the Labor move\nment is in agreement upon our\npolitical program and objectives.\nNo barriers should be permitted\nto stand in the way of joint or\nparallel action in the political\nfield with the unions of the AFL,\nthe Railroad Brotherhoods and\naffiliated organizations. Such unity\non the poltiical front will not only\nmobilize 14 million workers and\ntheir families, but will stimulate\nand rally broad non-labor groups\nand help give effective political\nvoice to millions of farmers, con\nsumers and other progressives in\nevery walk of life.\n1R\nUE-CIO LOCAL 754\nVICTORY DANCE\nand\nFLOOR SHOW\n(4 ACTS)\nBob Howard\'s Orchestra\nat Democratic Club, 121 South Ludlow St.\nSaturday, December 18th, 1943\nRefreshments Free Adm. $1.00, Tax Incl.\nReliable Furniture Co.\n200 Stoves—All Kinds—New and Used\nCALL HERE FIRST FOR BARGAINS\n416 E.

The\nannouncement came simultaneously with a statement by the U. S.\ngovernment that the steelworkers have set a new national production\nrecord under the win-the-war leadership of President Philip Murray.\nWith the wage announcement,\nmade here by Murray following a\nmeeting of USA Executive Board,\ncame his statement that CIO has\nspent more than $2,000,000 at\ntempting to acquaint the public\nwith the urgency of maintaining\na stable economy by rolling back\nprices so that workers in every\nwage category would be able to\nbuy enough food to maintain\nenergy for effective production\nfor victory.\nAn official USA statement said:\n"The United Steeworkers of\nAmerica and its membership have\nconsistently supported a program,\ndesigned to achieve the stabiliza\ntion of our national economy\nthrough effective price control,\nrationing, equitable taxation and\na stabilization of wages, and aid\nthe effective prosecution of the\nwar.\n"While wages have been frozen,\nthe other portions of the program\nhave been ignored, thereby laying\nthe basis for inflation. As a result\nof this failure, it has been the\nworkers solely who have borne\nthe increased burdens resulting\nfrom these conditions.\n"In order that there may be ef\nfective stabilization of our na\ntional economy and to avoid the\nvery dangers of inflation, this In\nternational Executive Board here\nby adopts the following program:\n"1. The national officers are au\nthorized to convene a wage and\npolicy conference for the purpose\nof formulating the demands of the\nmembership of the union regard\ning necessary wage adjustments\nand other improvements.\n"2. The national officers are au\nthorized following such confer\nence, to forward appropriate no\ntices to the companies with which\nthe union has outstanding collec\xad\ntive bargaining agreements for\ncollective bargaining conferences\nto present the program of the\nunion."\nShortly following the announce\nment that the USA will take the\nlead among CIO unions pressing\nfor abolition of the Little Steel\nFormula which limits wage in\ncreases, President Roosevelt an\nnounced the appointment of a\nfive-man committee composed of\nmembers of the War Labor Board,\nto probe the cost of living and\nthe methods of the Bureau of La\xad\n4\n^*4\nv I#?\nDayton Union R«wi\nbor Statistics in estimating the\ncost of living index.\nNamed on the committee are\nPresident R.

No increase in\nthe amount of gasoline allowed is\ninvolved, however.\nAll "B" and "C" coupons issued\nthroughout the country on and\nafter December 1 will be worth\nfive gallons each, as compared\nwith the present value of two gal\nlons for coupons of those types in\nthe east and midwest and three\ngallons in the far west.\nThe new supplemental gasoline\nration coupons of five gallons\nvalue will be issued with the\ndesignation, "B-2" and "C-2" on\ntheir face. As present "B" and\n"C" and "B-l" and "C-l" coupons\nrun out, they will be replaced by\nthe new higher-unit-value cou\npons. Meanwhile, outstanding\ncoupons issued before December\n1 will continue to be worth only\ntwo gallons in the east and mid\nwest and three gallons in the far\nwest.\nOPA explained that "B-l" cou\npons are a reprint of the earlier\n"B" coupons. They are used in\nthe same way and have the same\nvalue. The same thing is true of\n"C" and "C-l" coupons.\nWhile the change does not mean\nmore gasoline for holders of sup\nplemental ration books, it does\nmean that they will receive their\nrations in more convenient form.\nIt is expected that many car own\ners, for example, will now buy in\nfive-gallon units as they custom\narily did before rationing began.\nConsumers will have fewer cou\npons to endorse.\nShow 25%\nEarn Less Than\n50c An Hour!\nWASHINGTON—More than a\nfourth of the employees involved\nin wage adjustment cases of the\nWar Labor Board in September\nearned less than 50 cents an hour,\nstates the WLB\'s seventh monthly\nreport Some 77 per cent averaged\nless than 80 cents an hour, while\n4.3 per cent averaged less than 40\ncents.\nIn a section on incentive plans,\nthe hoard said that action on such\nproposals "will be limited to a de\ntermination of whether or not the\nproposed plan is In conformance\nwith the national stabilization pro\ngram and would result in unau\nthorized wage rate decreases or\nincreases.\nOnly plans submitted voluntar\nily by employers or plans agreed\nupon by employers and unions\nwhich have collective bargaining\nrights with the company concerned\nwill be considered\n"Incentive wage payment pro\ngrams will not be ordered in dis\npute cases," the board said, "since\nthat would be incompatible with\nthe need for cooperative effort,\nwhich is basic to the unnfi of\nsuch programs."\n"DON\'T FORGET!"\nKOORS "29"\nCarl B.

Rep.\nUER&MWA\nI have been asked many ques\ntions recently regarding the posi\ntion of the UE on wage policies,\nIn brief, I will attempt to outline\nthe policy on wages as formulated\nby the UE in line with the na\ntional policy of the GIO.\nThe UE has always based wage\npolicies on one basic principle,\nand that is the wage policy must\nbe so constructed in order to ad\nvance production and aid the war\neffort.\nThe first of 1943 the UE formu\nlated a wage policy which in brief\ncontained the following points:\n1. Stabilization of economy\nthrough a broad overall program\nof production, including wages,\nprice control, taxation and ration\ning.\n2. Flexible WLB policy to make\nup the disparity between actual\nwages and the cost of living.\n3. Elimination of wage differen\ntials.\n4. Equal pay for equal work.\n5. Protection of rates and in\ncreased wages for incentive and\nhourly rated workers. The UE\nduring the past year has scored\nremarkable success in the applica\ntion of these policies within the\npower of the International Union.\nThe UE has been successful in se\ncuring sizeable increases both for\nincentive and hourly rated work\ners.\nThe UE was instrumental in se\ncuring millions of dollars in retro\nactive pay in the negotiation of\nwage increases. However, with all\nthe gains that the UE was able\nto gain for its membership, due\nto the refusal of Congress to en\nforce a roll back of prices, a\ngreater disparity exists today in\n"take home" pay than the case a\nyear ago. The CIO has constantly\ninsisted on a stabilization pro\ngram to enable the workers to\nmaintain a decent American\nstandard of living. The persistent\nrefusal of Congress to outline a\nprogram to lead the nation to\nvictory has forced the CIO to re\nconsider the wage policy, and at\ntempt to devise a program to make\nup the disparity that exists be\ntween "real" wages and what the\nworker has to pay for the neces\nsities of life.\nTo sum up the UE wage policy\nin line with the CIO, from thk,\ntime forward demand that the\nfollowing points be carried out:\n1. Intensification of the cam\npaign for national economic sta\nbilization.\n2. Extension of union safeguards\naround methods of wage payment\nso that wages will keep pace wit\nproduction for both incentive an\nday workers.\n3. A general wage adjustmei\nto correct the disparity between\nwages and living costs, according\nto a flexible program*\n4. Elimination of regional, local\nand plant inequalities, with the\nestablishment of Industry-wide\nwage standards.\n5. Full power to the War Labor\nBoard to give just and adequate\nsolutions to labor disputes.\nYou can do your part in your\nshop to make this program pos\nBible. Make your union as strong\nas possible by signing up every\nnon-member that works with you.\nWrite your legislative representa\ntives on bills that concern labor,\nand express your opinion to them\non your position on roll-back,\nsubsidies, etc.\nCIO Guild\nPerforms For\nSmith Committee\nHie "Smith for Commissoiner"\nCommittee held a final get-to\ngether on Thursday, Nov. 11, and\nwere entertained by a group of\nplayers from the CIO Theatre\nGuild tinder the direction of G.\nHarrison Fenner.
