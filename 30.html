MITCHX., Coprrtffht by Am?1oui P km Aaao, c la Mod. lUL, Miss Macgrefw was a Scotch Mr., who came over to America from Glas, gow to Boston In colonial days. MKs, Macgregor at the tlim> the events nar, rated In this story occurred was aixty, years old. four feet eleven Inches high, and her circumference four feet two, Her hair was snowy white. Ttoert, wns much In the elderly mslden\'s ap, pearance to indicate that she was, firm of porjiose. Her face was square,, her eyes deer set In the sockets, and, the corners of her mouth curved, downward. She had never married, and had never had any desire to ho, married, indeed, the male sex was, repulsive to her., Miss Macgregor came from Scotland, with her father, who accumulated a, fortune in trading on the tea. At his, deeth. which occurred when be was, a very old roan, he left his daughter,, then past middle ag?. several ships,, besides houses and land. Miss Mac, crcgor took his place in the manage, ment of her property, continuing the, business on the ocean. She would, have made women captains of her, ! vessels, hnt In those days women were, POLLOmtr- TH* RrrRRATTSO PCOCA3CEKR., Dot ambitions to take tbe places of, men. and do female no* captains were, to be obtained. ObHced to pot np, with men. she continually chafed at, everything they did. One source of, tremble sbe had with them was that, they wished to be prepared to resist, the pirates who infested the seas Id, those days, while Miss Macgregor., who was a theoretic nonreslstant, though practically sbe never gave way, to any one, declared that she would, rather lose every ship sbe owned than, have a drop of blood shed to save, :bem. This was all very well for this, cood lady, bat It meant death to her, captains and crew*. Yet argue as they, would they failed to move her., "Ttinr\'s na use o" trylD\' to mak me, go back od my principles," she **ki., "for 1 wu! na do t", Miss Macgregor after spending, many years at work finally decided to, rake a voyage to one of ber ships. She, elected the Scotia. Captain Ethan, Hardwick. tbe nun sbe most trusted, of all tbe masters of ber vessels. Cap- ;, tain Hardwick on ber announcement, of ber Intention to go with him on his, next cruise Informed her that the tss, sel needed overhauling. and be was, given a month ft?r tbe purpose., Now. the captain on his last voyage, bad dodced two pirates and shown a, clean pair of heels to a third. His, overhauling meant the taking aboard, of a do-en runs of different caliber and, arwnrinc masked portholes? masked i, rather \' ? deceive the owner than the, pirsto- He had always carried, nn, hr s* her. a full supply of small, srr - h would be only useful In, ? ? i\'.<. rders. He had once ask, ed 1 1 ? r..r those weapons, stating what, he Khcd them for, ? Ve il no t;oed them." she said, "for, ye\'ll tak do boarders on ony sheep o\', i mine.", When all was ready Miss Macgregor, went aboard the Scotia, going up the, gangplank slowly that she might take, In every thing in sight Six open, ings for guns confronted her on that, side of the vessel, but they bad been, so carefully concealed by Captain, Hardwick that tbe old lady\'s eyes,, weakened through ape, failed to take, them In., Tbe most the captain bad expected, was that the lady would not discover, tbe heavy guns till tbe ship was so far, out at sea that getting rid of them, would be impracticable. And even, then he feared sbe would order them, heaved overboard. But. as good lnck, would have it Miss Macsregor was so, deathly seasick fbr the first mouth that, she never shewed herself out of ber, !raMn Another mouth followed, dur, ng which she sat by day on deck, wrapped In a Macgregor plaid. 8be, would use no other figure, being very, ptvud of the clan from whence sbe, sprang., One day when the sea was choppy,, slrtlnc In ber accustomed seat fighting, off eea?lckness, sbe noticed an unusual, movtnc about of tbe officers and crew, The former were passing a gl?ss, among them, each In turn bringing It, to bear on a distant ship. Calling tbe, captain to her sbe asked what Inter, . csted tbera, "That vessel we iiuspect to to t, ! pirate." be replied, Instead of rawing fear the old lady, Stood op on her fret, took the flam, and looked for benelf., "Wb*\' makes ye tblnk abe\'a a pi, r ratef, ? She\'* bollt only tor speed and flfbt, tag.", The old lady said no more. Brought, face to fnce with that which she bad, beard of only at a distance ber non, resistant iboory ootliipxed. But abe, was too proud to adnHi It., Tbe stranger was erldently steering, a course to bead off Vbe Scotia. Ml?s, Macrrogor aat imniornble, while tbe, two ship* were luerltably drawing, closer together. Then* waa no fear tn, ber face, but a thundercloud. Were, there a mythological goddeaa of war, abe would bare t<een Ms impersonation, Presently tbe *trans>er "broke" the, skull and cross bo nesi. firing at tbe, aarae time a abot across tbe Scotla\'a, bows. Immediately Mlaa Macgregor, heard tbe rolling of iruns on a lower, deck., "Wba\'s that?" abe afked., "Guna," replied tbe captain., Tbe curve of tbe old lady\'s Hps, tnrned from down war I and upward In, a grim smile Bot she said never a, word. Sbe bad no encomium for Cap, tain Ban!* ick for dlnobeylng her or, ders and no reproof., "Strike tbe flag." tbe captain ordered., Up Jumped Miss Maegregor. "Strike, tbe flap!" sbe cried "Never. Not on, my sheep while I\'m al>oard of her.", "It\'s a rose." explained the captain., "I wish to get her within range and, when our broadside failes ber we\'ll ron, out our gun* for tbe fight.", "Ah. weet." said the lady, "1 did na\', think o* that", Tbe pirate unsuspectingly drew near, er and the two ressela stood aide by, side, a cable\'s length iipart Tbe buc, caneer did not consider It worth while, to open his ports, thinking bis price, a mere trader. Suddenly the Scotia\'s, | ports flew open and a broadside tbun, i dered forth., "Weel done, captain r Mid tbe old, lady. "Can ye na giv? him another?", Some confusion was manifest on tbe, pirate, but his guns were ron oat and, tbe flght was opened., A great change ciime over Mis* |, Macgregor. her appearance suggesting, ber ancestor hlghlanders\' "wha\' wl, Wallace bled." Hardidck endeavored, to retain tbe command!, but soon gave, way to the little Scotchwoman. Un, fortunately, she did not have tbe, knowledge of seamanship and ord, nance with which to curry on such an ;, I encounter and it went against her., ; The pirate kept drawling nearer. Bnal, i ly getting Into a position favorable for, grappling Hnrdwick told tbe men to, 1 go below and bring up the mnsketa, and cutlasses. They did ??. and tbe j, captain suggested to his commander j, that tbe crew He beneath tbe bul-j, warka and if the pirates attempted to j, board surprise them. Sbe consented j, and. taking a cutlass, iicreened herself, among them on tbe bows near where, the bucca\' . . "a were erldently aiming |, to grapple, ITMOTHIT a DOT* IDC DPIQ!" Ol lUtrar !, waiting was t ho sound of Irons catch, ing on the gunwale. Hard wick had, told the men to wait till he (rare the, signal to rl?e. but as be wss shout to, do so Miss MactJregor sprang with an i, agility boBtting a younp irirl on to the I, bulwarks and. holding with her left j, band to the foremast ratlines, wared ,, a cutlass with the other, "Cotne on. ye Imps o\' Satan." she, cried, One of the pirates was about to, leap to the Scotia, btit thl* (trance, apparition threw him Bat aback. Bnt, only for a moment. The Scotia\'s men, supported their lender nrxl for a time, repelled the attack Nut at last the, buccaneers pained a ft<othold on the, Scotia\'s dock, and ber <rew were drlr, en back., An hour passed. bnt the pirates conld, not score a victory. A number of, times the Scotia\'s crew would hare, glrcn np the flftht bnt for the Indom, itable resolution of Miss Macgregor., One glance at her adamant face and, they were ready for another thrust, n>e officers realizing ber ralne pro, tected her from many a stroke that, would hare cleft her like an apple., "Oet awaT she cried to them. Bnt, they refused., Her men. fighting as they were for, tbeir lives, as time went on killed and, disabled more pirates than they lost, themselves. Finally CapUdn Hard, wick, seeing that he bad his enemies, outnumbered, gave a iHgnal for one, concentrated effort It so reduced the, pirates\' numbers that they gave way., Miss Macgregor broke through those, of her own side In frcat of her and, followed the retreating buccaneers,, chopping them with b-tr cutlass, till, Captain Hardwlck caught ber by ber, skirts and pulled ber tiack. Most of, the fleeing men were killed. The rest, jumped Into the sea. Tben MUw Mac, gregor stood on the foi*castle, cover, ed with blood, ber iktrts torn to, shreds, her white batr unloosed and, flying In the winds, not a whit of her, sternness gone, and sakt:, "Tbor\'s na kirk on t:be sheep, bat, that\'s na reason why we shouldn\'t, fcave prayers Ooon on yer knees and, give thanks for the victory!", Not a man bnt dropped. Not a man, dared disobey lest she cut him down, for mntlny. and Ml*s Manrregof, poured forth In her quaint Scotch dia, lect thanks that they bad not only, been spared, but had bfen enabled to, smite their enemies., The episode changed Miss Macgre, por\'s noncombattnt principles Wben ,, ?he returned from ber \'forage as fast, as i*er ships came In she pnt aboard, the heaviest guns tbej\' would bear, j, and when she had completed tJbs J, armament the vessels resembled a ;, fleet of men -o\' war., Will!, Many Alaskan Poop)# Know the It, porUnce of Healthy KJdiwya., The kidneys ftfter the blood., They work night and day., Well kidneys remove tropnrftl<*., Sick kidney* allow impurities to, multiply., No kWwy HI should be n??W W., There is grave danger in delay., If yog have backache or urinary, trpubliia*, If you are diiry, nervous or worn, on\'-,, Benin treating your kidneys at, once;, Uae a proven kWiney remedy., None endorsed ilka Doan\'a Kidney, Pills, Recommended by thousands., Proved by grateful testimony., John Cong or, 845 N.
