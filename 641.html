The context of this \nrelationship is best understood within the overarching paradigm of militant\nactivities of post 9/11 Taliban and al-Qaida remnants in Pakistan\'s \ntribal areas, where these groups flourish. The military struggle in Afghanistan\nhas significantly influenced the formation of a loosely structured al-\nQaida/Taliban "nexus" that was forged in Pakistan\'s Federally Administered\nTribal Areas (FATA), particularly Waziristan. In order to survive the \nongoing North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military operations \nto flush them out, these groups rapidly devised a symbiotic strategy that \ncharacterizes al-Qaida\'s ability to subsume itself within the ranks of different\nmilitant organizations in Pakistan.\nThe Taliban\nAfter U.S. forces toppled the Taliban regime in Kabul in the aftermath of \nSeptember 11, the Taliban retrenched a sizable contingent of forces along \nthe Durand Line (the frontier between Pakistan and Afghanistan). The \nDurand Line abuts swathes of rugged mountainous territory, which is a \nsurveillance nightmare. These areas are replete with mountain passes and \ntreacherous routes linking Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are in most \ncases known only to the locals. It is not a coincidence that the Taliban \nresurgence in Pakistan has taken place in areas that adjoin the Taliban\'s \ntraditional strongholds in Afghanistan; the remote southern plains of \nHelmand Province is one such area, where the Taliban possess the capability\nto disrupt transport and logistical supply on the highway connecting \nKandahar with Herat.1 This area is contiguous to the Pakistani territory of \nthe Noshki-Chaghai region in Baluchistan Province, where the Taliban \nhave found refuge among dispersed, but sympathetic, local tribes.\nAbbas Zaidi: Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2010\n', "Journal of Strategic Security\n2\nSimilarly, even though they have largely been prevented from taking over \nthe city of Kandahar, the Taliban maintain a formidable presence in the \nneighboring Afghan countryside, which is not far from the Pakistani city \nof Quetta. Quetta and its suburbs, like Pashtunabad, have consequently \nbecome centers of Taliban consolidation, with some sources maintaining \nthat Mullah Omar has been hiding in Quetta, Kandahar, or Helmand.2 \nSimilarly, Taliban are reported to use the Toba Kakar mountain pass \nroute north of Kandahar to penetrate into Pakistan's tribal areas whenever\nthe Waziristan route is inaccessible because of increased vigilance by \nthe Pakistani military.3\nSouth Waziristan is adjacent to the Paktika Province in Afghanistan, \nwhere U.S.-led forces have a large base in the Barmal region, as well as \nseveral outlying check posts scattered around the landscape. Similarly, \nNorth Waziristan abuts the Afghan provinces of Paktika and Khost. \nReportedly, there are 243 illegal passages in North Waziristan by which it \nis possible to enter Afghanistan, while there are only five check posts on \nthe border in this area.4 Whenever the Pakistani army initiates operations \nin these areas, terrorists move from one side of the Pakistani border to the \nother, seamlessly and with impunity.5\nFrom Afghanistan to Pakistan\nAfter the United States and its allies launched operations in Afghanistan \nto flush out the Taliban and al-Qaida fighters, many of these militants \nused their knowledge of the terrain to escape from the American dragnet. \nThe American operations 'Anaconda' and 'Snipe' for example, which were \nintended to flush out the Taliban in Khost and Shahi Kot in Paktika Province,\nonly managed to push al-Qaida fighters further inside the FATA \nareas of Pakistan.6 Having regrouped from their newly enshrined refuge \nin the FATA, these cadres soon initiated militant activities against the \nAmericans and the Karzai government. The initial strategy utilized was \nthe kidnapping of American and Afghan government officials, who were \nused as bargaining tools.\nOn September 5, 2002, a tribe in the Bannu district of the North West \nFrontier Province (NWFP) forced the Pakistan army to release six prisoners\narrested for their alleged links with al-Qaida.7 Sometime later, in July \n2003, a Waziri sub-tribe in North Waziristan helped al-Qaida terrorists \nkidnap five U.S. troops, forcing the Pakistan army to launch its first major \nmilitary operation against the tribes.8 The operation masqueraded under \nthe guise of 'routine military exercises.' American kidnappings had by \nthen become a favorite tactic with Waziri tribesmen, reports of which \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 3, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol3/iss1/2\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.3.1.1\n", 'Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups in Pakistan\n3\nstarted cropping up sporadically in the media.9 This crisis necessitated a \nresponse by Pakistani Government forces in the shape of \'Operation \nMountain Lion\' in October 2003, which claimed the lives of thirteen alQaida\nmilitants, tribesmen, and Pakistani Frontier Corps (FC) person-\nnel.10 Escalating U.S. insistence for decisive action forced the Pakistani \nGovernment to pressure the local tribes into releasing the hostages, which \nprompted a standoff.\nThe Shawal Region of Waziristan\nThe mountainous Shawal region of Waziristan, adjacent to the even more \ninaccessible Afghan Shawal range, came into prominence after the infamous\nTora Bora bombing campaign, where ibn Ladin and Zawahiri were \nbelieved to have been in hiding.11 The area is extremely remote; the Pakistani\nGovernment had nominal influence here even before the arrival of \nthe Taliban. For example, much of the populace was involved in nefarious \nactivities like kidnapping for ransom, heroin trafficking, and carjacking, \nwith minimal or no law enforcement action taken by the state in \nresponse.12 The tribal leaders in these areas were extremely reluctant to \nhand over the foreign fighters and terrorist facilitators to Pakistan\'s Government\nforces. Consequently, joint U.S.-Pakistani military operations \nbecame commonplace in these areas, though the United States refuted \nany claims of being directly involved in anti-militant activities on Pakistani\nsoil.13\nOfficial Pakistani estimates of al-Qaida fighters present in Waziristan in \nlate 2003 ranged from 100 to 600 fighters.14 The local tribesmen, however,\nwere estimating much higher figures: around 1,500 al-Qaida guerril-\nlas; mostly Chechens, Uzbeks, and Arabs, were thought to be present in \nand around South Waziristan.\nMilitary engagement in the tribal areas intensified in October 2003, when \nthe Zalikhel and Karrikhel tribes blatantly refused to surrender their alQaida\nand Taliban "guests" to government troops. In the ensuing stand-\noff, twenty-two al-Qaida members and seven tribesmen were reportedly \nkilled. When it became evident that Pakistani forces meant business and \nweren\'t taking no for an answer, the tribal leaders handed over about a \ndozen al-Qaida warriors to the army on the condition of a ceasefire.15 \nEarly on during this operation, the militants escaped to nearby mountainous\nregions with the help of local woodcutters and shepherds, who are \nintimately acquainted with the region. These so-called guides were paid, \nAbbas Zaidi: Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2010\n', "Journal of Strategic Security\n4\nby local standards, handsomely for their services; 5,000 to 10,000 Pakistani\nrupees ($60–120 U.S. dollars) each for a safe passage to the moun-\ntains.16\nFault lines in the NWFP\nThe high mountain ranges of the NWFP, many of which are covered in ice \nmost of the year, have provided safe haven for militants.17 These areas \nabut China and Afghanistan, with a narrow strip of Afghan land, the \nWakhan Corridor, separating them from Tajikistan.\nOn October 5, 2003, Pakistan's security forces destroyed a training camp \nrun by Harkat ul-mujahideen (HUM) in Diamir, in the Northern Areas of \nPakistan.18 The camp was ostensibly a terrorist facility involved in training\nTaliban, al-Qaida, and HUM militants in domestic terrorism, and in \nthe blockading of the Karakoram Highway.19 Besides the HUM camp, \nother camps sprang up in Ghowadi village in Skardu, Juglote near Gilgit \nand Konoda Gilgit. A huge training facility was also established near \nMansehra in the NWFP on the Karakoram Highway.\nAccording to the jihadi periodical Zerb-e-Momen,20 Americans suspected \nibn Ladin's presence in these areas at about this time; the subsequent FBI \nsearch operations, however, yielded no positive results. Hazarding an \nempirical observation, it seems that American intelligence was correlating \nincreased militant traffic in the area with the presence of the supreme \nleader of al-Qaida; it seems unlikely, however, that he would be directing \nmilitant movements at the grassroots level in person at all theatres. His \npresence has been postulated at different times in places such as Quetta, \nPeshawar, Chitral, and other areas in Pakistan but has not been substantiated.\nIt seems that whenever intelligence reported increased militant \nactivity in these areas, rumors about ibn Ladin's presence started spreading\nsimultaneously, which may have been conjecture on the part of \nauthorities.\nThe presence of jihadist organizations like Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), \nTehreek-e-Khudam-e-Islam (TKEI or Jaish-e-Muhammad), and Jamiatul-Ansar\nin these areas is quite well documented. Ostensibly, accessibility \nto Central Asia is one of the desirable characteristics of this region for \nthese pro-Taliban and al-Qaida organizations. This development has \nalarmed the Chinese government, which sent a list of terrorist organizations\nof concern to the Government of Pakistan.21 Chinese agencies \nasserted that more than 1,000 Uyghurs were trained by ibn Ladin's forces \nin Afghanistan, for fomenting separatist movements in China's Muslim \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 3, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol3/iss1/2\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.3.1.1\n", 'Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups in Pakistan\n5\nareas.22 Many of these Uyghurs became active members of the East \nTurkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group Beijing asserts is linked to \nUsama bin Ladin and Pakistan-based HUM. China has repeatedly warned \nthe Pakistani Government of the potential for these militants to enter its \nXingjiang Province to conduct terrorist activities.23 Pakistan\'s NWFP \ncould provide the ideal linkage to these areas and beyond. It may be pertinent\nto mention here that the \'liberation\' of the Muslim majority province \nof Xingjiang is part of the manifesto of many Pakistani jihadist organizations\nsuch as Harkat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, Jamat ul-Ansar, and Lashkar-e-\nTayyiba.24\nEvolution of al-Qaida in Pakistan\nU.S. intelligence sources estimated in mid-2008 that "Pakistani military \noperations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas have had limited \neffect on al-Qa\'ida," ever since Pakistani authorities started operations \nagainst the organization in response to escalating U.S. pressures in the \npost 9/11 period.25 The Pakistani military seemingly underestimated the \nstaunch tribal affiliations and the popularity of the mujahids amongst the \nlocals. Consequently, military action did not produce the desired result. \nAfter sustaining heavy losses, the government in Islamabad concluded the \nShakai agreement in mid-2004 with one of the leading militant commanders\nin Pakistan, Nek Muhammad Wazir, a local pro-Taliban leader. \nIt seems likely that foreign militants were still present in the area when \nthis agreement was concluded.26\nNek Muhammad Wazir was no stranger to anti-government militancy, \nand had set up two radical organizations; Jaishul al-Qiba al-Jihadi al-Siri \nal-Alami, which was openly supportive of al-Qaida, and Jundullah, which \nwas at one time allegedly headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), \nthe al-Qaida operational commander of the 9/11 attacks.27 Nek Muhammad\nprovided the Taliban and al-Qaida the requisite logistical support \nand manpower needed to reorganize in the tribal areas, and helped to \nestablish training camps in Wana and other areas of South Waziristan.28\nBaitullah Mehsud also showed up around this time along with several \nprominent Taliban leaders, such as Maulana Dadullah; Dadullah \nreportedly met with Nek Muhammad to express dissatisfaction with Nek \nMuhammad\'s agreement with the Government of Pakistan. Reportedly, \nthe Taliban high command or Shura decided to replace Nek Muhammad \nwith Baitullah Mehsud as the operational commander in Waziristan; Nek \nMuhammad, however, convinced them of his undying loyalty, and was \nallowed to retain his command position.29 Baitullah\'s name had cropped \nAbbas Zaidi: Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2010\n', "Journal of Strategic Security\n6\nup as a natural choice because he was the leading commander among the \nMehsud tribe. Interestingly, his positional authority was based on \npolitical expediency, rather than on any military credentials. Arguably, \nthe scorched earth tactics used by the Pakistani army enraged militant \ntribals like the Mehsuds, who started joining the Taliban and al-Qaida \nmovements en masse as a retaliatory measure. The terrain in the Mehsuddominated\nareas is treacherous, with steep defiles and rugged mountains. \nOstensibly, this hostile terrain, along with the common bond of Mehsud \nhostility towards the armed forces, motivated the locals to provide \nsanctuary to a large number of al-Qaida and Taliban fighters.30\nAfter the Sararogha accord with Mehsud, it seemed that the shift in state \npolicies regarding the foreign presence in Waziristan was complete; \ninstead of expelling them, the Pakistani state had to settle for tacit agreements\nfrom locals that these foreigners would not create trouble for Paki-\nstan. This would prove to be a mistake; a comprehensive counteroffensive \ninitiative was lost in return for short-term peace, which would ultimately \nprove detrimental to Pakistan.\nThe Shakai accord created ripples of discontent on both sides of the \nDurand Line. To prevent al-Qaida and Taliban militants from re-entering \nAfghanistan from the Pakistani side of the Durand Line, the Americans \ndeployed hundreds of troops in the Birmal, Argoon, and Khost areas of \nPaktika province at the time the accord was signed.31 In short order, Nek \nMuhammad was targeted by a missile attack and killed; he was soon \nreplaced by Baitullah Mehsud.\nMilitant Organizations\nThe Taliban and al-Qaida were not the only organizations which were \nforced to retreat to Pakistan in the wake of the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan;\nmany Pakistani jihadist groups like Harkat-e-jihad-e-Islami \n(HUJI), along with Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and Sipah-e-Sahaba militants \nalso found their way back home. Many HUJI commanders and warriors, \nengaged in the fighting in Kandahar and Qandooz, escaped into \nWaziristan and Buner in NWFP. HUJI was one of the main Pakistani \norganizations supporting Arab militants in Afghanistan, with its leader \nQari Saifullah Akhtar being held in great esteem by Mullah Omar. HUJI's \nimportance in the eyes of the Taliban was such that Mullah Omar \nappointed in the Taliban government three Taliban ministers and twentytwo\njudges who belonged to Qari's HUJI. These linkages would eventually \n'al-Qaidaise' HUJI in Pakistan.32 Moreover, HUJI would later cleverly \nblend in with the more mainstream political scenario in Pakistan by havJournal\nof Strategic Security, Vol. 3, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol3/iss1/2\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.3.1.1\n", "Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups in Pakistan\n7\ning many of its militants drafted into Maulana Sami ul-Haq's Jamiat \nulema Islam Sami ul Haq (JUI-S) party.33 This effectively camouflaged \nHUJI militants from scrutiny later on, in the wake of the Pakistani Government's\ncrackdown against militant groups from January to December \n2002; at least 2000 militants were arrested during this operation, very \nfew of whom belonged to HUJI.34 Rana asserts that HUJI was responsible\nfor providing the recruiting and networking facilities for al-Qaida, \nwith cadres being drawn from Lashkar-e-Jhangvi( LJ), Jaish-e-Muhammad\n(JM), Jamiat-al-Ansar, and Sipah-e-Sahaba for al-Qaida's opera-\ntional divisions.35 To support his argument, Rana mentions that when \nQari Saifullah Akhtar was arrested and extradited from Dubai on August \n7, 2004, he disclosed these details while being interrogated by intelligence \nagencies. He also reportedly disclosed that scores of HUJI militants were \nworking with al-Qaida, with several of them actively engaged in fighting \nagainst the Pakistani troops in Waziristan.36\nSipah-e-Sahaba\nSipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) merits a somewhat detailed discussion \nhere, since it is one of the main Pakistani militant organizations supporting\nthe Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. The organization was \nfounded in 1985 with the primary aim of elimination of Shias and Shiism \nfrom the society. A causal loop of retribution and vendetta between the \nShia militants and SSP ensued, which claimed the lives of Haq Nawaz \nJhangvi, the founder of SSP, and Sadiq Ganji, the Counsel General of Iran \nin 1990. SSP was also active on the political scene, claiming political lineage\nby independently standing for elections in 1992. Moreover, SSP \nfought with the Taliban against Ahmed Shah Masood and the Shiite Hazaras\nin Afghanistan, and is thought to be jointly responsible with the Tali-\nban for the massacre of Hazaras and Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan in \nAugust 1998.37 After being banned by the Pakistani Government in 2002 \nbecause of American pressure, SSP simply changed its name to Millat-eIslamia.38\nIts activities went underground but nevertheless continued. \nThis practice of adopting noms de guerre in response to bans while continuing\nactivities would characterize many Pakistani jihadist organiza-\ntions in the post 2002 period. The importance of SSP diminished \nsomewhat after the 2003 assassination of Azam Tariq, its paramount \nleader, and because of the formation of the more radical breakaway splinter\ngroup, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LJ), from within the ranks of SSP.\nIt is important to contextualize here the continuous evolution of terrorist \ngroups; they are usually in a constant state of flux in terms of capabilities, \nsophistication, and ideology. Newly emerging groups usually remain \nAbbas Zaidi: Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2010\n", 'Journal of Strategic Security\n8\nunder the tutelage of more established organizations until they develop \nthe required levels of proficiency. Thus, SSP at one time consisted of two \nloosely allied subgroups, namely Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which acted as a \nkind of domestic "Shia elimination unit," and Jaish-e-Muhammad (JM), \nthe "externalist" face of SSP.39 Both these groups remained under SSP \nuntil they had developed their capabilities, after which they broke away \nfrom SSP and emerged as more potent terrorist entities. At least six other \nsplinter groups were formed from SSP, namely Jhangvi Tigers, al-Haq \nTigers, Tanzeemul Haq, Al Farooq, al-Badr Foundation, and Allah-oAkbar,40\nthough JM and LJ are the only powerful organizations to \nemerge from the SSP schisms. A change in leadership also tended to take \nthese organizations on different trajectories; for example, Masood Azhar \nand Riaz Basra, the new leaders of JM and LJ respectively, were more \nradical in their views, and consequently formed more violence-prone factions.\nMoreover, an organization may become smaller and \'leaner and \nmeaner\' after splintering from its parent body, as happened in the case of \nLJ and JM, or larger groups can be formed by smaller factions, which is \nwhat has happened in the case of the Taliban in Pakistan.\nThe Lashkar-e-Jhangvi model\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi epitomizes a decentralized jihadi organization based \non a modern, devolved al-Qaida model. Founded by Riaz Basra, it is "very \ndecentralized and compartmentalized,"41 and represents the ideal form \nwithin which al-Qaida militants can operate freely. Moreover, it is probably\nbased on an organizational model that al-Qaida itself has presumably \nadopted in Pakistan. The LJ militants took sanctuary in Pakistan after the \nfall of the Taliban, rather than run the risk of falling into the hands of the \nNorthern Alliance leaders in Afghanistan. LJ was taken over by the \'internationalists\'\nand became irrevocably intertwined with the radical ideolo-\ngies of the Taliban and al-Qaida. The ideal organizational structure for \nthis kind of decentralized group is the \'cell based\' structure. The greatest \nadvantage of this model is security; any given cell, if compromised, ideally \ndoes not have information about other cells, and therefore cannot disclose \ntheir identity. Moreover, it is impervious to penetration at higher organizational\nlevels, even if compromised at the cellular one. A cell is composed \nfor a particular operation, and is disbanded after the objectives of the unit \nhave been realized. Intelligence estimates put the number of a typical LeT \ncell at three militants, though it can consist of up to seven persons according\nto the tactical requirements of the operation.42\nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 3, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol3/iss1/2\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.3.1.1\n', "Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups in Pakistan\n9\nHarkat-ul-Mujahideen\nThe Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM) was initially formed as a splinter \ngroup of HUJI under the leadership of Fazlur Rehman Khalil. A detailed \nreview of the development of these organizations is outside the purview of \nthis study and many laudably detailed studies, particularly by Amir Rana, \ncover this area. Our concern here is to demonstrate its link to al-Qaida \nand the Taliban. In the wake of the American defeat of the Taliban, Khalil \ntook hundreds of HUM militants to Afghanistan, many of whom were \nkilled when the U.S. bombed suspected al-Qaida camps near Khost and \nJalalabad in August, 1998.43 Khalil returned to Pakistan in 2002, apparently\nto resume the struggle from within Pakistan.44 He subsequently \nresigned from the leadership of the organization, but his jihadist credentials\nentered the international spotlight again when the FBI arrested two \nAmerican-born Pakistani jihadists in California in 2005.45 These men \nrevealed that they had received militant training under HUM tutelage \ndirection in the centre of the densely populated Pakistani city of Rawalpindi.\nReportedly, this covert training facility was being run by Khalil, \nwhich suggests that he still retains 'international' jihadist linkages. Thus, \neven though HUM is said to have been marginalized by newer organizations,\nits potential for helping Taliban and al-Qaida cannot be ignored.\nTehreek-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Muhammadi\nAnother important organization whose role needs to be examined here is \nthe banned Tehreek-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Muhammadi (TNSM). The firebrand\ncleric Maulana Sufi Muhammad formed TNSM in 1989, ostensibly \nfor promoting peace and harmony. However, the movement soon \nrevealed its radical colors when it initiated an armed uprising in the wake \nof the Pakistan Supreme Court's February 12, 1994, verdict, which nullified\nthe Provincially Administered Tribal Area (PATA) regulations. These \nregulations had governed certain areas (including Swat and Malakand) \nsince the 1970s, and the governance vacuum created by the cancellation of \nthese regulations apparently encouraged TNSM activists to agitate for the \nestablishment of a Sharia form of government in the Malakand areas \nadjoining Swat. The state was able to suppress the unrest by a combination\nof counterinsurgency operations and negotiations, though the Sharia \nsystem was introduced in the Malakand area twice in response to TNSM \npressure. The flourishing of TNSM was amply demonstrated when Sufi \nMuhammad crossed over into Afghanistan, reportedly with 10,000 fighters\nto aid the beleaguered Taliban. His force was routed and disbanded, \nhowever, and Sufi was arrested on his way back to Pakistan. Nevertheless, \nthe TNSM movement had already deeply penetrated the tribal systems of \nAbbas Zaidi: Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2010\n", "Journal of Strategic Security\n10\nSwat, Hazara, and the Bajaur agency. These cadres would later form the \nbackbone of the Taliban in Swat and Bajaur, where the Taliban effectively \nhijacked the TNSM movement. Two of the most prominent leaders of the \nPakistani Taliban, Maulana Fazlullah in Swat and Faqir Muhammad in \nBajaur, were at one time TNSM adherents. Moreover, many of their fighters,\nparticularly in Bajaur, are from the ranks of the TNSM.\nAl-Qaida in Pakistan: A Decentralized \nOrganizational Model\nThe initial euphoria in the wake of the post 9/11 American operations \nagainst al-Qaida, in which the organization was presumed to have been \nseriously weakened, has been gradually wearing off. Al-Qaida seems to be \nresisting heightened international operations against it by insinuating \nitself into other militant entities. The radical jihadist organizations in \nPakistan have become one of the main hubs of al-Qaida reentrenchment.46\nIt also seems that the senior al-Qaida command and \ncontrol structure has not been significantly disrupted, and that \nrecruitment continues unabated.47 In the ongoing imbroglio of events, it \nhas become increasingly unclear who exactly is in charge of al-Qaida in \nPakistan, and this complicates the counterinsurgency efforts to eliminate \nthe leadership of the organization.\nEven though the attacks in Pakistan against al-Qaida have been effective, \nkilling as many as eighty al-Qaida fighters in 2008 alone,48 the organization\nis still presumed to retain a significant strike capability because of \nbetter human and financial resource management, as well as its entrenchment\nin FATA.49, 50 Many reports have questioned the counterinsurgency \nefforts against al-Qaida, pointing out that despite a seemingly all out \noffensive the organization essentially retains its potency.51 Michel Hayden,\nformer Director of the CIA, has mentioned on record that al-Qaida's \nphysical safe haven in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area provides it \nwith the physical and psychological space to meet, train, expand its networks,\nand prepare new attacks.52 Evidence suggests that Pakistan's \nPashtun-dominated tribal areas are the command and control centre for \nal-Qaida's core leadership, which was reportedly actively engaged in planning\nattacks in the western hemisphere.53 This is evidenced by the fact \nthat both the 9/11 and 7/7 attacks were later linked to training facilities in \nPakistan that were heavily influenced by al-Qaida ideology.\nAl-Qaida remains so elusive partly because of its propensity to rapidly \nalter its command and control structures in response to changing circumstances.\nThe difficulty in substantiating linkages is that the organization \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 3, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol3/iss1/2\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.3.1.1\n", 'Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups in Pakistan\n11\nhas become decentralized in Pakistan; as mentioned above, it has been \nsurmised that nobody is controlling al-Qaida, but that it has integrated \nitself into jihadist movements around the globe.54 There have been media \nreports that Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri has assumed command of al-Qaida, \nfueled by statements that ibn Ladin has not chaired meetings of al-Qaida\'s \nShura Council since 2007. Purportedly, Zawahiri has been busy rebuilding\nthe organization\'s logistical and human resource capabilities in Paki-\nstan.55 There have also been reports that the Shura Council meets in \nPakistan.56 Al-Qaida in Pakistan likely exists in a networked structure \ncomposed of small \'cells\' found in jihadist organizations such as LJ, as \nwell as in \'clusters\' of these cells within the larger Taliban umbrella organization.\nThis is not a new development; terrorist organizations seem to be increas-\ningly adopting a networked structure in response to counterinsurgency \npressures, which allows them the freedom from a hierarchical command \nand control structure. Another advantage is that in this loose network, \ncommand and control can be decentralized, and may not even require \nintimate geographical proximity. It appears that al-Qaida has adopted \nthis sort of network in Pakistan while effectively merging into a network \nof allied militant bodies.\nMoreover, Pakistani intelligence agencies deduce that al-Qaida, in \nresponse to increasing pressures, is now conducting "decentralized operations\nunder small but well organized regional groups" within Pakistan and \nAfghanistan.57 Some analysts maintain that even though the organization \nis under stress, and currently not in a position to carry out a major attack \nin the United States, it is nevertheless adapting to this hostile environment\nby shifting to mobile training teams instead of designated training \nsites. Pakistani intelligence officials maintain that such decentralized \ntraining is effective, being conducted by small groups of bomb-making \nand/or tactical experts in private safe houses.58\nFluidity of Structure\nIntelligence also suggests that al-Qaida is now replenishing its depleted \nranks (killed or arrested) with less experienced, but much more fanatical \nwarriors. These fighters are being recruited in the Middle East, North \nAfrica, and Central Asia, concomitant with an increase in funding and \nlogistical support for the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The new \nal-Qaida militants enter Pakistan\'s Baluchistan province via Iran, and \nthen report to Waziristan for training. This foreign presence is amply \ndemonstrated in Swat, where Fazlullah, the leader of the Taliban in Swat, \nAbbas Zaidi: Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2010\n', 'Journal of Strategic Security\n12\nis reportedly supported by about a half dozen seasoned Arab fighters from \nal-Qaida.59\nSeasoned al-Qaida commanders continue to be found in FATA, such as \nUsama al-Kini, a Kenyan, who was alleged to be the mastermind of the \nterrorist attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008, and was \nkilled in January 2009 near Wana.60 Militants arrested in Pakistan are \nfound to originate predominantly from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, UAE, \nMorocco, Libya, Kuwait, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and West Asia, while \nthere have also been a few arrests of nationals from the United States, \nAustralia, and the UK.\nAs mentioned above, al-Qaida has started functioning as a loose network \nof groups spread throughout the world. Affiliated \'nodes\' include the \nEgyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), Al Jamaya-al Islamia (IJ: Islamic Group \nof Egypt), Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA), Islamic Party of \nTurkestan (IPT), Jaish-e-Muhammad (JM: Army of Mohammad), and \nthe Abu Sayyaf Group of The Philippines (ASG).61 The constituent groups \nof the network maintain a distinct command, control, and communication\nstructure,62 but have the inherent flexibility to incorporate the al-\nQaida operational philosophy. Thus, while acting as the second-incommand\nof al-Qaida, Dr. Zawahiri also leads the EIJ in Egypt.63\nNot everyone agrees about the existence of a Taliban/al-Qaida nexus, \nasserting that al-Qaida and the Taliban are fighting their own separate \nwars which may overlap but have distinct objectives. "There are two battles\ngoing on here," says Ikram Sehgal, a defense strategist. One, he says, \ninvolves the American search for al-Qaida operatives hiding in the tribal \nareas. The other is the Pakistan military\'s fight against the Taliban movement\nof Pakistan that has taken root in the northwestern regions of the \ncountry….Though the two have \'linkages,\' they are "two separate wars."64\nOn the other hand, it is reasonable to propose a Taliban/al-Qaida nexus in \nPakistan; the hostilities between the state and tribesmen began with the \ndemands of the former to the latter to hand over foreign militants. It \nshould be remembered that a formally constituted Taliban umbrella body \nhad not been formed at that time, even though the tribesmen may have \nbeen decidedly pro-Taliban. Moreover, many of the disparate groups that \nwould ally themselves under the banner of the Taliban had not yet forged \ntheir symbiotic relationships, even though they may have been \ncooperating in their efforts. Thus, the beginning of the jihad is marked by \nal-Qaida entrenchment in the tribal areas, and it seems unlikely that the \norganization would not have participated in the ensuing alliances and \nconsolidation. It also seems unlikely that al-Qaida would have neglected \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 3, No. 1\nhttps://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol3/iss1/2\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.3.1.1\n', "Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups in Pakistan\n13\nto reconnect with its former jihadist allies, such as Sipah-e-Sahaba and \nHarkat-ul-Jihad-ul-Alami, in order to 'blend in' with the militant \nlandscape.\nConclusion\nThe Taliban remnants from the Tora Bora and other allied campaigns \ntook refuge in FATA areas of Pakistan which are geographically contiguous\nto Afghanistan, and provided easy access because of the Pashtun Tali-\nban's familiarity and cultural affiliations with the region. In these areas, \nparticularly Waziristan, the locals were receptive to the influence of these \nmilitants. During the Soviet jihad, the state had led these locals to believe \nthat militants in Afghanistan were 'heroes' and 'mujahids,' and the identification\nof these same men as villains was not well received. The humiliat-\ning peace deals concluded by the state with militants such as Nek \nMuhammad further emboldened these Taliban and al-Qaida remnants, \nwho resumed their activities in the form of kidnappings, which in turn led \nto military operations by the state. However, the peace accords concluded \nbetween the militants and the state gave the former the chance to reorganize,\nsince the army was loath to enter the imbroglio of these areas, after \nwithdrawing consequent to a peace deal. Militancy was further heightened\nby the support of many militant organizations in Pakistan, which \nhad been in intimate contact with Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan's \ntraining camps and battle grounds, and were openly contemptuous of the \nstate's volte face regarding jihad in the post 9/11 scenario.\nThe cadres of organizations like TNSM and SSP provided the substrate \nfrom which the Taliban would recruit; TNSM provided the leadership and \ncadres in the NWFP, effectively becoming the new face of the Taliban. SSP \nsplintered into more radical groups, which either swelled the ranks of the \nTaliban, or provided sanctuaries for al-Qaida, or both. As the movement \ngrew in magnitude, many other organizations of various sizes but with \nsimilar hardline ideologies joined the ranks of these Taliban; at the same \ntime, independent recruitment also continued. Thus, these organizations \ncontinued to grow in their own capacities, particularly in the NWFP, until \ntheir trajectories met in the shape of a unified Taliban movement in \nDecember 2007. These problems forced the Pakistani state to engage in \nnegotiations with the militants and, consequently, interrupted trend lines \nof successes of military campaigns. The result led to uneasy peace accords \nthat would break down under duress of the militant propensity to violate \nthe same by continued kidnappings of state officials or enforcement of \nAbbas Zaidi: Geographic Trajectories of Al-Qaida and Taliban Terrorist Groups\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2010\n", 'Journal of Strategic Security\n14\ntheir brand of Sharia.
