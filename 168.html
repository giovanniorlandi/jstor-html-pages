The order for his deportat- j\nion has been announced in iriany (j\'jar- \'\nters as wholly unjustifiable, and in- \'\nvolving a ilcaial if u. \'\n" \' . me right of fre?-\ndom of speech and opinion guaranteed j\nby the Feedral Constitution. But the\nSupreme Court of the United States\nhas sustained the action of the immi\ngration authorities with resepct to th-j\nplea that Turner had not been shown\nto be an active anarchist. Chief Jus\ntice Fuller, in his opinion, says th?\ninference made by the officers, as t.\nthe right of exclusion, was not unjus\ntifiable, "if he contemplated the ulti\nmate realization of his ideal by th-i\nuse of force, for his speeches were\nincitements to that end."\nThe decision is unquestionably wed\nfounded. There is practically no dif\nference between the direct advocacy\nof force and the teaching of doctrines\nwhich logically and inevitably lead to\nthe use of force for the overthrow of\ngovernment, law and order. That is\nwhat anarchy teaches, and what it nec\nessarily involves. The Act of Congress\npassed a year or two ago for the ex\nclusion of anarchists from the Unita.l\nStates was directly in response to\npopular sentiment. Liberty of speech\nin this country is not inconsistent with\nthe exercise of the right of self pre\nservation on the part of the govern\nment. There should be no interference\nwith freedom of opinion as to the va\nrious means that may be employed o\ncarry out the general objects of -government,\nbut any teaching which\nseeks absolutely to overthrow; by un\nlawful means, the very fabric of the\ngovernment itself, cannot and should\nnot be tolerated.

Several\nlights have taken place during the past\nfew days that are coming to light. The\nRussians mustered their forces and\nmade a sortier from Port Arthur. They\nwere met by a large body of the Japa\nnese rrnd a battle raged for several\nhours in which the Japs were driven\nback after suffering a loss of over a\nthousand men. The defeat of the Jana-\ngated yesterday and the subject waj , . f. , . that thev have bei,n\ngiven a pretty thorough airing. Of\nthe dozen men who participated in\nthe discussion, not one was against it,\nbut the problem of where to build\nwas deeply considered. One or two\nwere of the opinion that in case a new\nhouse was built, it should be on a lot\ncloser to the center of town, while\nthe majority favored the old cit .\nThe fact that the county owns a gen\nerous piece of land where the old\nschool stands, seems to be suflicient.\nIt is close enough fcr a town the size\nof Carson, and no child has to walk\nover a half mile to reach- its doorx\nThis, in any other section would t-e\nconsidered a close place to the homes,\nand it is about as healthy a spot as\ncan be found, as the drainage is good,\nand the school sets above the valley\nbelow, . . .\nThere is no question but that this\ncounty can assume a debt of the size\nthat will be needed fcr the ereo;inj of\na substantial school. It is a simple\nr.roblem of bettering the general con\ndit\'on of affairs for a ol :t r: that\nint?nl to be in busine?F io.\' all time\nt cue. The outlook for \'hi? pi-iic-ular\nsection ;-: \'l.U\'eqng and be need\nof the improved condition is apparent\nto all who have given the malter any\necu sderation.\nCarson has struggled along with k.\nschool that is not only a disgrace, but\nin a measure is unsafe, as has been\ndemonstrated during a dozen high\nstorms. Carson\'s school children have\nmade records that are; worthy of the\nhigh school, and a number Qf outside\npeople come here every year to. take\nadvantage of the good schooling thut\nis given the children.\nSome argue that the old school\nhouse has withstood nearly a half cen\ntury of wear, and tear \' and is there\nfore good enough for the present gen\neration. It\'ia\' not a, question of goOd\nenough, 7 but a question of a better con\ndition and modern improvements. The\nwear of the old building shows for it\nself, and anyone who will look over\nthe old rickety wooden edifice will con\nclude that a better and safer buildina\nis what is needed for the young folk\nthat are attending school and tho.\nwho are growing to occupy the desks.\nThe Appeal believes that the move\nment should carry to the last voter\nand that not a vote should be recorded\naeainst the project. As for the school\ntrustees who are now occupying th\nposition and who have given thei\ntime and. attention without pay, they\nshould at least be honored withtn a\ntrust that has been carried out a )\nfaithfully. The old board should be\nre-elected and will, as no opposition\nis placed against them, but the big\nquestion to be settled is the vote on\nthe bonds, and it will carry, and thi\nheavier the majority the better,- as it\nshows the condition of this city bet\nter than any one object that could\nbring it out. .\n. ; : -\n.

VI\nThat on November 7, 1902, defend\nant, had ov.d now has at least $40,0 0\nof the money of said estate which\nshould have been then distributed anl\npaid to plaintiff and others as provided\nin said agreement and of which th\nplaintiff then was and now is entitled\nto have and recieve the sum of $5,000\nj as her share and portion thereof, anl\nsnid money is the separate property cf\nplaintiff,\nj VII\nj That ever since said November 7,\n1002, said defendant has and now doe3\nfail, neglect and refuse to pay plaintiit\nher share of said money or any part\nthereof.\nWHEREFORE, plaintiff prays judg\nment against defendant for the sum of\nFive Thousand Dollars, ($5000) with\ninterest thereon at seven per cent per\nannum since November 7, 1902 and for\ncost cf suit herein."\nThe demurrer which was sustained\nwas taken on the grounds, first, that\nthis, complaint does not State facts\nI sufficient to constitute a cause of act\n:uon are whether the defendant is lia\nble individually on a contract made by\nher personally and before her appoint\nment as executrix, by which she ag\nredd that after her appointment she\nwould, without any decree of distribu\ntion pay to the plaintiff and the other\nlegatees named in the will the amount\nof their respective proportions of any\nmoney which miglit come into her\nhands in excess of Five Thousand Dol\nlars, and if she is so responsible, the\nquestion, arises, secondly, whether the\nj plaintiff in this action can recover on\nj the contract set out in the complaint\nj when she was not one of the parties\n! that signed it, because it was for her\nj benefit and was accepted and partly\n. executed between her and the defend-\nthat she had no authority to enter into\ncontract binding the estate, that mon\ney could not be taken out of the es\ntate to meet such an agreement and\nthat the statute relating to distribution\nmust be followed, but the suit is not\nbrought and no relief is asked against\nthe t defendant in her representative\ncapacity, nor against the estate nor\nunder the statute and as the personal\njudgment sought, and execution there\non could not affect or reach the money\nor property of the estate, the matter\nfor consideration is not confined to the\nbroad proposition as urged in the de\nmurrer whether an heir or legatee can\nbring suit against the executrix for.\nj any portion of her share of the estate\nbefore distribution is ordered, but whe\nther she is bound individually by her\ncontract when she promises for valua\nble considerations yielded to her .o\nperform some act pertaining to i.he\nmanagement of the estate such as the\npayment of money owing or to become\ndue from the estate to heirs or others.\nWe see no reason why she could not\nbind herself to make such payment be\nfore the decree of distribution by the\ncourt or contemporaneously with or at\nany time after the execution of her\ncontract, and even regardless of her p\npointment or acting as executrix. The\npromise to pay when the money came\ninto her hands was as binding as any\ntimelv condition which fixed in ad\nvance an exact nate wnen payment\nshould be made instead of naming this\ncontingency. If. to meet the personal\nobligation which she incurred by the\nexecution of the contract, she uses the\nmoney belonging to the estate, she\ntakes the risk of not having the same\nallowed to these legatees finally by the\ncourt, and if other devises or heirs ap\npear who are entitled to the money or\na part of it, she and her bondsmen will\nbe liable to them and it is not appar\nent that tne enforcement of her pr-\nmise will work any injury to the es\ntate. After receiving the benefits\nwhich the agreement provided for her,\nshe should not be allowed to repudiate\nthat part of it which is advantageous\nto the others interested. Beginning\nearly in the common law the rule has\nlongk prevailed and the authorities are\nnumerous and in harmony, those in the\nUnited States following the English\ncases, to the effect that administrators\nand executors become personally lia\nble on their promises made under cir\ncumstances similar to those existing\nhere, although they cannot so bind the\nestate. Ordinarily they must do many\nacts and make many contracts for\nwhich they are liable personally and\nfor which they are entitled to be reim\nbursed ultimately on the presentation\nand allowance of their accounts by the\nprobate court. The rule is well stat\ned by the Supreme Court of Ohio in\nHeirs v. Administrators of Waldsmith,\n2, Ohio, 1G0.\n"If the action is founded on a pro\nmise made by the testator or intes\ntate, in his life, the defendant must\nbe sued in his representative charac\nter; he may plead plene administravit\nand the judgment must be done upon\nand the judgment must be de bonis\ntestatoris; but if the plaintiff rely on\na promise by the executor after the\ndeath of the testator it is not neces\nsary to name the defendant a sexe\ncutor, yet this may be done; they may\nte named as administrators by way of\ndescription or for the purpose of show\ning the circumtsances of the tram\naction and the origin of the liability;\nbut the defendant cannot plead plena\nadmnistravit and the judgment should\nbe de bonis propriis.\n"If the declaration presents a claim\nto which the defendant is liable in his\nrepresentative capacity only, as on an\nobligation executed by the testator, he\ni must be sued as executor and the judg-\nment, must be de bonis testatoris; but\n! if it present a demand which origina\n! ted from the acts of the defendant in\nhis capacity of executor, but for which\nhe has become individually liable, as\nestate and give his own note in the\ncharacter of executor, he may be de\nscribed in the writ and declaration as\nexecutor or that description may be\nomitted and in either case the judg\nment would be de bonis propriis."\nIn Austin v. Munro, 47 N. Y., it\nwas said:\n"The rule must be regarded as well\nsettled mat the contracts of executors\nalthough made in the interests and for\nthe benefit of the estate they represent\nif made upon a new and independent\nconsideration as for services rendered\ngoods or property sold or delivered or\nother consideration moving between\nthe promisee and the executors as pro\nmisors, are the personal contracts rf\nthe executor and do not bind the es\ntate, notwithstanding the services ren\ndered, or goods or property furnished\nor other consideration moving from the\npromisee are such that the executors\ncould properly have paid for the same\nfrom the assets and be allowed for the\nj expenditure in the esttlement of their\naccounts. The principal is that an exe\ncutor may disburse and use the\nfunds of the estate for purposes au\nthorized by law but may not bind tha\nestate by an executory contract and\nthus create a liability not founded up\non a contract or obligation of the tes\ntator. (Ferrin v. Myrick. 41 N. Y. 315;\nReynolds v. Reynolds. 3 Wend. 244;\nDemott v. Field 7 Cow., 58; Myer v.\nCole, 12 Johns., 349). The rule is too\nwell established to be questioned or be\ndisregarded ; and all departure from it\nwould be mischievous."\nIn Luscomb v. Ballard 5 Gray 403,\n66 Am. D. 375, the Supreme Court of\nMassachuestts said:\n"The law is that by a promise, the\nconsideration of which arises after the\ndeath of the testator or intestate, the\nestate cannot be charged, but the ex\necutor or administrator is personally\nliable on his contract. And whether\nthe amount is to be repaid from the es\ntate is a question for the court of pro\nbate in the settlement."\nUpon a demurrer in Holderbough vs.\nTurpin, 75 Ind., 84, it was held that\nwhere a corni\'nt charges the exe\ncution of a cont iact by an administrat\nor in his individual capacity, it binds\nhim individuallyalthough it relates to\nmatters connected with the estate, and\nthat where he enters into a contract\nupon a consideration accruing subse\nquent to the death of the decedent,\nit is deemed his individual contract.\nThis doctrine has been applied and\nhas bound the executor or administra\ntor personally for work done or goods\nsold to one as executor.

A. 850, Vt., and under the same\nrule and more directly executors have\nbeen held personally liable for the\npayment of legacies, upon their ag\nreement or implied promise to pay the\nsame, Davis, Reyner, 2 Lev. 3; Evans\ny. Foster, 14 L. R. A. 117 (Wis.) In\nPerry v. Cunningham, 40 Ark., 185, the\nacceptance by an administrator of an\norder drawn on him by a creditor of\nthe estate conditioned to pay "as soon\nas accruing rents of the estate would\npermit" rendered him personally lia\nble upon receipt of the rents. An ex\necutor becomes bound personally up\non his promise to pay the debt of the\nthe testator in consideration that the\ncreditor will forbear for a time to\npress his claim, bishop on Contracts\n(Enlgd. Ed.) Sec. 1252, 1 Story on Con\ntracts (5 Ed.) Sec. 361, and the cases\nthere cited. These principles are also\nreiterated in 1 Bishop on Contracts\n(8 Ed.) 128 and in the elaborate note\nmentioned n the brief, 52 Am. Dec,\nbeginning at P. 118.\nThe objection that the plaintiff can\nnot maintain the suit because she was\nnot a signatory to the contract is un\ntenable under Milaini v. Tognini, 19\nNev. 134, and under the decisions cited\nthere and in 9 Cyc, P. 377 to 382. In\nluat case this court said:\nThe precise question presented is\nthis: Can a plaintiu maintain an act\nion on a simple contract to which he\nis not a party, upon wnich he was not\nconsulted, and to which he did ont as\nsent, when it contains a provision for\nms benefit? Besiues the statute wbicn\nprovides that "evey action shall be\nprosecuted in the name of the real\nparty in interest," this court has held\nin three .uerent cases that the bene\nficiary named in such a contract may\nmaintain an action thereon in his own\nname.\nThe order and judgment sustaining\nthe demurrer and dismissing the act\nion are reversed, and the case is re\nmanded with direction to the district\ncourt to fix a time within which the\ndefendant will be allowed to answer.\nTalbot, J.\nWe concur:\nBelknap, C. .\nFit.gerald.
