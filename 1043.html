IF, Cor. Centre and Frontßti., Freeland,\nFREELAND, PA., MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1903.\nIN THE WOULD\nOF POLITICS\nCandidates for Local Offices\nSure of Victory.\nDemocratic Nominees Feel\nConfident That the Result\nWill Favor Them When\nTomorrow\'s Polls Close.\nThe politicians" of the borough have\npractically completed their preliminary\nwork for tomorrow\'s contest, and both\nsides present facts and figures which\nmake their friends confident that vic\ntory will perch tomorrosv evening above\nthe names of their favorites. Notwith\nstanding the assurance thus displayed,\nthose who are not misled hy the parti\nsans concede that the chances for suc\ncess are far more favorable to the Dem\nocrats than their opponents.\nThe town being Democratic by a\nmajority of at least 100 votes, the Re\npublicans, to win, must necessarily have\nmade an aggressive fight for votes.\nThis, so far, has not been done, and it Is\ntoo late now, according to results of the\npast, for them to overcome the natural\nlead of the majority party.\nIn previous elections for burgess and\ntax collector the Republicans were\nequipped with an organization and gave\nvaliant ba.itie at every poll. This year\ntheir candidates find themselves lighting\nalmost, alone, with their rank and file\napparently disinterested and lukewarm\nas to the result, and with no organized\neffort being made to gain votes from the\nDemocrats.\nOn the other hand the Democratic\ncandidates, Messrs. Oherrender, Mc-\nNeils and Conahan, tho aspirants for\nburgess, tax collector and auditor re\nspectively. have made a good canvass of\nthe borough and are assured of solid\nsupport from their own side and no\nsmall amount of help from Bepublicans\nwho are dissatisfied with their party as\nat present controlled.\nThe Democrats will have overv poll\nwell manned with Intelligent and ex\nperienced vote-getters, and will make\nan aggressive fight in every ward.\nThe candidates for school directors\nand councilinen in all tho wards, in\ncluding those where the Republicans\nwere too faint-hearted to name tickets,\nare working unitedly and sincerely for\nthe success of the general ticket as well\nas for their own, and as far as present\nIndications can he relied upon the party\nwill score its usual tri-ennial victory\ntomorrow.\nLocal Prices Should Fall\nReports from tidewater points and\nthe large cities indicate that the general\ncoal famine has come to an end. There\nare spots where anthracite is still a\nscarce article, but. these are isolated\nsections and the trouble is due to local\ncircumstances. In New York and\nPhiladelphia tho markets are-becoming\ncongested, and In the former city an\nthracite is now SC) 50 a ton. There is so\nmuch coal in that city at the present\ntime that the retail dealers hold a meet\ning on Saturday to decido whether or\nnot they should reduce tho price to 80\na ton. After a long conference it was\ndecided to keep coal at tho present mar\nket price of $6.50 a ton.\nOutside tho anthracite region people\nwho need coal can buy it in any quanti\nty and size they desire. Freeland con\nsumers, however, are not so fortunate.\nHere they are still paying famine figures\nand are restricted as to quantity and\nsize. Markle & Co. continue to adhere\nto their rule of refusing coal to all ex\ncept their employes. Coxe Bros. Co.\nsell pea coal only and In half-ton lots at\nthat, for which thnv get $3.25 a ton at\nMISCKLLAN KOl\'B A DVKItTISKM ENTB.\nHi LECTION NOTICE Notice is hereby\nj given Hint ut tho elect ion to be hold onrhe\nthird Tuesday of February, 190.!, being tno\nseventeenth of that month, the following of\nficers of the Middle Coul Field Poor District\nare to be elected, to wit:\nOne person for director, to servo for three\nyours from first of April, I\'.HH, whose residence\n\'must lie iu that port in i of the district com\nprising tho lower or Munch Chunk district.\nDue person for director to serve for one\nyear from April I, 1903, whose residence\nmust be in i hut portion of the district known\nus the middle or Weutherly district.\nDue person for auditor, to serve for three\nyears from April 1, 19 3, whose residence\nmust be in that portion ol\'the district known\nas the upper or Hu\'lctoti distiict.\nW. 8 Campbell,)\nFrank White, -Directors.\nW. 8.

Upper Lehigh Com\npany will sell pea, chestnut or stove, but\nthe distance it must be hauled makes\nthe cost very high. Since the price of\ncoal fell in the largo cities M. Schwabe\nhas been selling to the local trade in\nsmall quantities.\nFreeland consumers deserve more\nconsideration from the individual oper\nators hereabouts rtiau they are receiv\ning. Situated, as they are, in the\nmidst of millions of tons of anthracite,\nthey should be permitted to buy such\nsizes and in such quantities as are best\nadapted to their needs. Consumers 200\nmiles away from the region can now do\nthis, and the discrimination against\nFreeland patrons should be removed\nwithout further delay.\nPoor District Report.\nThe annual financial report of the\nMiddle Coal Field Poor District appears\non the third page of this issue, and we\ncommend it to our readers as worthy of\nperusal and consideration. The report\nis very complete and shows in detail\nhow the finances of the district are ex\npended by the directors and others in\ncharge of the funds. The district is\none of the largest and most complex of\nIts kind In the state and requires per\nsonal and constant attention from the\ndirectors. The latter have done ex\nceedingly well during the past year,\nhaving kept tho expenses down to near\nly $3,000 less than tho previous year,\nnotwithstanding the fact that) the coal\nstrike made an unusually heavy de\nmand for outdoor relief.\nThe taxpayers are justified In con\ncluding, after examining the report,\nthat the district is in good hands, and\nthe recommendations made for needed\nimprovements should bo t warmly sup\nported.\nBall of Division 19.\nAt Krell\'s hall tomorrow evening the\nmembers of Division 19, A. O. H., will\nentertain their friends with what prom\nises to be one of the best halls of tho\npresent season. The organization is\ncomposed almost entirely of young men\nwho are well versed in arranging for\naffairs of this kiod, therefore those who\nattend can expect that nothing will be\nomitted that will add to their pleasure.\nAmong the features of the hall will be\nwaltzing and stop-dancing contests, to\nthe winners of which 820 worth of prizes\nwill he awarded. Every lady attend\ning will he presented with a handsome\nsouvenir program.\nThe committee in eharg\'o has ar\nranged t\'o obtain tho election returns\nof Freeland borough and Foster and\nHazle townships as soon as they are\ncounted, and the results will be an\nnounced from the stage.\nDance music will be furnished by St.\nAnn\'s bund.\nMine Burning Since 1857.\nThe Lehigh Coal and Navigation Com\npany will shortly begin the work of\nquenching tho mine fire in the old\nGreenwood workings, near Tatnaqua,\nwhich has been raging since 1857. The\nsame methods used at tho famous burn\ning mines at Summit Hill will be adopt\ned. Holes will be bored In the top of\nthe mountain through which culm will\nbe poured upon tho fire.\nWhen the fire started the workings\nwere owned by the Little Schuylkill\nCompany. They spent thousands of\ndollars in tho effort to extinguish the\nlire, hut all to no avail, and several lives\nwere lost in the attempt.\nWhen the fire is extinguished tho com\npany will be enabled to tap some of the\nrichest veins in that region.\nDeath of John Maloney.\nJohn Maloney, aged 70years, of Shepp\nton, died yesterday after a brief illness,\nduo to paralysis. The deceased\'s fumi\nly took up their residence at Sheppton\nseven months ago, after being evicted\nfrom a house owned by Coxe Bros. & Co.\nat Oneida, because of alleged active\nparticipation in the strike.\nThe deceased resided for many years\nat old Buck Mountain and later at High\nland. Besides a wife he is survived by\nthree sons and two daughters, viz., Mrs.\nJohn Sharpo, Oneida; John, Lansford,\nand Maggie, Timothy and James, at\nhome.

Every\nadmirer of Shakespeare was pleased\nwith the acting of E. N. Hoyt as Mer\ncutio, Fannie Iloyt as the Nurse, Paul\nine Paul! as Juliet and Charles Balsar as\nRomeo. They poriayed their characters\nexceptionally well and had the support\ning company been of the same high\nstandard the production would be fit for\nany stage. The absence of several\ncharacters of the drama, whose presence\nis necessary to give the story cohereuce,\nhad a disappointing effect upon those\nwho depended upon the acting to grasp\nthe author\'s ideas.\nX t t\nWillis Granger, who has won consid\nerable success as a romantic actor and\nwho was seen hero last season In "A\nSecret Warrant," is starring in a ro\nmantic melodrama, "Gypsy Jack,"\nwhich will ho tho attraction at the\nGrand opera house Friday evening.\nIt is a production of merit, having won\npopular favor iu England, to such an\nextent that at present it is in the third\nyear of Its run In that, country, while on\nthis side of the water its success-this\nseason has been of tho most phenomen\nal kind. It has plenty of thrilling sit\nuations and is full to tho brim with the\nbest kind of fun.\nt t t\n\'•The Snollygostor In Politics" is the\ntitle of the lecture which Colonel II W.\nJ. Ham, of Georgia, will deliver tomor\nrow evening at tho Grand opera house,\nunder tho auspices of tho Mining and\nMechanical Institute. Speaking of this\nlecture the St. Loui9 Republic says:\n"No attempt to outline Colonel Ham\'s\nexcellent address could do it justice. It\nwas replete with wholesome truth and\nhealthy moral, and the closing part, in\nwhich he paid a grand tribute to tho\nGod-fearing and virtuous hoino, and\nmado a touching plea for the American\nboy as worthy of the best that could be\ngiven to him, was an admirablo piece of\nfervid and patriotic oratory."\nX X t\n"The Pay Train," a comedy drama\nwith bright sparkling lines and sensa\ntional situations and climaxes, will he\nseen at the opera house on Wednesday\nevening.

In order not to disappoint the\naudience the first and second clubs of\nthe Crescents played a free game, with\ntho score 24 to 24.\nPeople in Freeland have gone almost\ncrazy over basket ball.

How\nmany can guess what fort it is and\n(Where located? The name Is Fort\nMontgomery, and the location Is on an\nIsland near the foot of Lake Champlain,\n•bout half a mile northeast of Rouse\'s\nPoint, N. Y.\nA short time ago, when traveling in\nthat part of the country, I saw this fort\nand asked the name of it. "Why, that\nis Fort Blunder," said my informant.\n•\'Did you never hear of it?" I confessed\nIgnorance, and he explained matters.\nIt seems that after the war of 1812\nthe government of the United States\nbecame convinced that the entrance to\nLake Champlain should be guarded by\na fort strong enough to engage any\nBritish fleet which might attempt to\nforce an entrance to the lake, and so\nFort Montgomery was constructed at\na cost of nearly $500,000. It was an\nImmense fortification for those days\nand was arranged for three tiers of\nguns.\nJust about the time it was completed\nthe joint surveyors fixing the line be\ntween the United States and Canada\ncame along and, after doing a good bit\nof figuring, announced that Fort Mont\ngomery was on Canadian soil. The\nnorthern boundary of New York state\nwus the forty-fifth parallel, and this\nfort was several hundred yards over\nthe line. Work on the fort eame to an\nimmediate standstill, and the mutter\nwus made the subject of a special\ntreaty.\nIt was decided that In view of the\nfact that the United States had not in\ntentionally encroached on Canadian soil\nthe forty-fifth parallel should be bent a\nlittle out of its course at this point so\nus to include the fort. That is why\nthe fort Is called "Fort Blunder." It\n.was never armed and has never been\noccupied by more than one or two men.\n—New York Herald.\nPICKINGS FROM FICTION.\nDe tlredest people in the world is dem\ndat takes de most ease.—"Soil."\nThe only safe investments are educa\ntion and health.—"Daniel Everton."\nThe thing I did not pay for I found\nmost expensive.—"The World\'s People."\nYou may be sure the devil will liump\nhimself If you don\'t.—"Those Delight\nful Americans."\nThere is no such certainty of knowl\nedge on all subjects as one holds at\neighteen and eighty.—"Captain Mack\nlin."\nThere are greater virtues than thrift.\nIt is better to die penniless than to have\nbeen too much of a saver.—"The Un\nspeakable Scot."\n"Let me get over this difficulty some\nhow," says youth, "that I may play the\ngame of life well."

Placed in a\ncoffin and accompanied by a proces\nsion, lie was borne along, while chants\nwere sung, prayers said and tears shed.\nAfter the solemn farce was over he\nwas left alone in the cbapel, where he\nMcuained a short time before rising\nout of the coffin.\nWhat Started the Jar.\nWife—l wonder bow you can look\nme in the face.\nHusband—Oh, a man can get used to\nanything.—New York Times.\nIt\'s easier to explain your neighbor\'s\nfailure than your own misdirected ef\n.fgrta. —Chicago News.\nMENU OF THE TURKS\nDISHES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED\nBY AMERICAN HOUSEWIVES.\nViand** That Are at Once Appetizing;,\nNutritious and Inexpensive—Popu\nlarity of Vegetables and Sweets.\nThe National Dish.\nSome of the dishes found on Turkish\ntables might well be adopted by the\nAmerican housewife, being appetizing\nand inexpensive and easily prepared\nfrom articles that are to be found here\nin great abundance.\nTurks do not care for salads, but pre\nfer meat, fish, vegetables and sweet\ndishes. The Bosporus furnishes a great\nvariety of excellent fish, among them\nthe red mullet, oysters and mussels,\nbut the Turks have no idea of the\nchoice of cuts and simply ask for so\nmany okas, caring nothing so that they\nget meaty pieces with few bones.\nCorned beef, roast beef, steak these \\\nare unknown. Mutton, beef, a little 1\nveal, fowls and game are eaten. Pork •\nis "the unutterable flesh."\nBreakfast with the Turks of all\nclasses consists of a cup of coffee and\nbread. A piece of cheese rolled into the\nfat pancake is eaten by the laborers.\nThis is sometimes exchanged for cakes\nthat ure much like pretzels, only larger\nand not so hard. In the fruit sea sou\ndifferent kiuds of fruit are added, j\nBlack bread made of unboiled rye flour\nis sold everywhere and when fresh is\ndelicious. With a few grapes, a piece\nof the native cheese and a cup of coffee\nthe richest man is satisfied.\nWith all fish, lobsters and mauy ,\nmeats a sort of salad dressing is served\nmade of garlic, oil, breadcrumbs and\nvinegar, all bruised to a cream, with\ncaviare or cucumber. Mussels arc much\nlarger than in this country. They are\nwashed, steamed until they open, then\nfilled with rice, chopped onion and pep\nper and butter, packed closely iu a ves\nsel and baked an hour.\nTurks make few soups, as they prefer\nsolid food, but sardines, anchovies and\nsalted olives or pistachio nuts are eaten\nbefore meals as appetizers. Of vegeta- j\nbles, which enter largely into their\ndiet, the favorite is the tomato, and\nscarcely any dish is considered com\nplete without it, though they never eat\nthis vegetable raw. To preserve toma- i\ntoes for winter use they boil them uu- j\ntil the skins are loose, then pass them \'\nthrough colanders, after which they\nthrow salt into the pulp. This causes it\nto settle, and the water is poured off\nwhile the residue is put into thin bags\nand hung in the shade. The next day\nit is spread on fiat surfaces to dry.\nLater it is cut into squares and laid\nin covered jars. This process retains\nthe taste and qualities of the tomato \'\nbetter than canning, and a little water ;\nmakes the pulp moist again.\nPotatoes, a taste for which is an ac\nquired one with the Turk, are first\nboiled, mashed with eggs and a little j\nHour, then made into cakes and fried.\nBeans and lima beans are boiled with\ntomatoes and butter and sometimes on\nions. Squash is sliced and fried or\nstuffed with mincemeat, onions and\nboiled rice, and then baked. Large cu- |\ncumbers are also stuffed with minced i\nmeats and baked or are eaten raw with\nsalt. One good stew is made of mut\nton and green peas. Another has all\nsorts of vegetables, like an Irish stew.\nEggplant is cooked in many ways,\nsome of them palatable and good. One\nrecipe is called imambailde, which\nmoans that the imam for whom the\ndish first was made fainted with de\nlight at its excellence. To make it, cut\nslits in the sides of the eggplant and in\nsert a forcemeat of onion and minced\nchicken in the cavities. Tie strips of\ncloth around and fry thoroughly in boil\ning fat. Another way is to substitute ;\neggplant for potato in a stew. Toma- .\ntoes should also be added.\nMoussaka, another and better form,\ncalls for one large eggplant, sliced rath- |\ner thick, without peeling. Have a |\nquart of tomatoes freshly peeled or\ncanned and one pound of minced beef. |\nFry the beef until It separates, set\naside while the eggplant is being fried,\nthen put alternate layers of meat, egg\nplant and tomatoes in a deep dish;\nseason and bake in a slow oven one\nhour.\nAnother delicious dish results from\nplacing sliced onions, tomatoes and\nship\'s bread or soda biscuit In layers,\nwith a generous piece of butter, in a\ncovered dish. Bake slowly four hours.\nPilaf, the natioual dish of Turkey, is\nserved invariably at every dinner. Rice\nalways forms the foundation, and the\nmost popular variety is that where\nnothing but butter, tomatoes and rice\nis used. Take three-quarters of a\npound of Carolina or Egyptian rice,\nwash until perfectly clean and while\nstill wet place in a pan with one-quar\nter of a pound of butter. Stir over the\nfire until the rice has absorbed the but\nter and become a light golden color.\nAdd the rice to three pints of strained\ntomato juice, boil the whole up once,\nthen draw aside to cook, without, stir\nring, for twenty-five minutes. When\ndone, melt another quarter of a pound\nof butter, and when the pilaf is dished\nup pour it over the top. Each kernel\nshould be separate. The color will be\na rich light brown.\nYalanje-dolma is a popular dish with\nforeigners as well as Turks. Scald\nsome fresh green grape leaves. Take\na half pound of rice and fry in butter\nas for pilaf. Mince some onion and\nparsley very fine and add them to the\nrice with salt and pepper. Stuff each\nleaf with the mixture, fastening the\nlittle bundles with cloves. Lay them\nin a kettle, the opening downward,\nkeep them in place and just enough\nwater to keep them from burning.

NEUBUR6ER ESTATE,\nP. O. S. of A. Building, Freeland, Pa.\nTH AT CLOAK\nFarmer Foxglove, in pity for the\nWidow Waterman, who was too thin\nly clad for cold weather, recklessly\ntook down an old bombazine clonk,\noriginally a bright brown, but now\nfaded in as many streako as a zebra\nhide which had hung from time im\nmemorial in the back entry.\n"Where\'s the bombazine cloak, pa?"\nsaid Seraphiua after supper as she\ntook the milking pail. "It\'s raining a\nlittle, and the cows haven\'t come home\nfrom pasture yet."\n"If I had a pair of eyes, I\'d use\nthem," said Mrs. Foxglove, coming to\nthe rescue and viewing the row of\nempty pegs with an eager glance. "Well,\nI declare! Nehemiah," turning to her\nhusband, "that comes of leaving you\nto keep house. You must have gone\noff and left the door open, and some\ntramp lias got in and robbed us."\n"I did just step out to the woodpile\nfor some more logs," said the farmer,\nthankful for the avenue of escape that\nwas opened to him. "But I wasn\'t gone\nlong."\nMeanwhile pretty Sernphina, singing\nsoftly to herself, folded an old striped\nshawl around her taper shoulders and\nwent out to the pasture after the\ntruant cows.\nOld Tulip\'s bell was Jangling among\nthe silver stemmed birches on the\nbleak hill. They were already on the\nhomeward path, but Sernphina loitered\nunnecessarily on the footbridge that\nspanned a brawling brook.\nAll was still and dusk, a certain\nfrosty sweetness was in the autumn\nair, and the only visible person was a\nwoman farther down the brook who\nwas dipping out \\vnter.\nSuddenly there was another step\nstrong, swift and full of purpose. Sera\nphina\'s eyes brightened. A vivid color\nrose in her cheeks.\n"There he comes now," she mur\nmured. "There comes George!"\nTo her surprise and dismay, however,\nthe cavalier did not come up the hill,\nbut stayed his steps beside the other\nwoman below.\n"He is throwing his arms around her\nneck," thought the indignant Seraph 1-\nna. "He is—yes, he is actually kissing\nher! But 1 don\'t eare. Why should I\ncare? I\'m sure it don\'t matter to me."\nSeraphiua hurried the cows home and\nfinished the milking in less time than it\nhad ever taken her before. She was\njust carrying In the foaming pail when\na tall figure approached.\n"Seraphiua!"\n"Pray don\'t trouble yourself to speak\nto me," said Seraphiua, with a toss of\nthe head, "or If you do please call me\nMiss Foxglove!\' "\nAnd Seraphiua vanished through the\nkitchen door.\n"What\'s the matter. Phiny?" said her\nmother, noticing the girl\'s quick move\nments and heightened color.\n"Nothing, ma." said Seraphiua.\nIt was getting toward 0 o\'clock when\nthere came a knock at the door. Mrs.\nFoxglove opened it. There stood the\nWidow Waterman.\n"I hope I\'m not intruding," said Mrs.\nWaterman, "but here\'s the brown bom\nbazine cloak, Mr. Foxglove, and, hum\nbly thanking you all the same, I\'d rath\ner not wear it."\n"Eli?" said Mr. Foxglove in amaze\nment.\n"It was very kind of you to give It to\nme," went on Mrs. Waterman, to the\nutter discomfiture of the poor farmer,\n"but there\'s some tilings as human flesh\nand blood can\'t bear, and to have pea\ncon I\'UilaDy s son asking" II" lie could not\nsco me liome when I come out of the\nstore, and Mr. Ferdinand I\'luff saying\nwas I to be at the dance at Molindn Ed\nwards\' on Tuesday night, and might he\ncall for me at 8 o\'clock—well. It\'s rather\nupsetting. But the worst of it all was\nwhen I went to get a little water at the\nbrook. A young fellow seized hold of\nme and was going to kiss me. I believe\nit\'s the brown cloak as done It all,"\nwith a meaning glance at Seraphiua\nFoxglove. "So. if you would please to\ntake it hack, I\'ll try and get along with\nmy old shawl a spoil longer. And the\nroast chicken was very good, sir, and\nthat apple pie couldn\'t lie heat."\nThere was a moment\'s direful silence,\nand then Mrs. Waterman sidled out of\nthe room and betook herself once more\nto the mysterious silence of the night.\n"Well. I declare!" said Mrs. Fox\nglove.\n"Ma, don\'t scold pa," said Seraphiua,\nhalf way between laughing and cry\ning.\nThe farmer feebly rubbed his hands.\n"I think I\'ll go to bed," said he.\nAnd he went. Sernphina, running out\nfor a pitcher of water the last thing\nbefore shutting the house for the night,\nnearly stumbled agaiust George Pater\nson. •\n"Goodness me! What are you doing?"\nsaid Sernphina.\n"1 can\'t go home and sleep, Sernphina,\nwhile yon are angry with me," said the\npoor fellow, who was very desperately\nin love. "What have I done?"\n"Nothing." she replied. "Except—ex\ncept that you can\'t blame 111 c for being\nJealous when 1 Hee you bugging and\nkissing the Widow Waterman."\n"It was the cloak. Seruphina—the\nbrown clonk that misled me." pleaded\nGeorge. "I thought it was you."\n"Oh, It\'s all very well to talk!" said\nisernpninn.\nMrs. Foxglove thought Seraphiua had\nnever before been so long in bringing n\npitcher of water. To George Paterson,\nhowever, the moments seemed winged.\nBut nevertheless he went home re\njoicing.\nWhat She Wan Seeking.\nA lawyer who has charge of the col\nlection of rents of a large tenement on\nthe east side was recently visited by an\nold Irishwoman, who after much per\nsuasion had been induced to come down\ntown and pay her rent.

Y. He took Representative\nJohn Sharp Williams of Mississippi,\nthe poet of the Yazoo, up there with\nhim once, says a Washington corre\nspondent of the New York World.\nThe other day Williams went over to\nSibley\'s desk and said, "Joe, do you\nremember that fine park back of your\nhouse up there on Lake Cliamplain?"\n"Indeed I do," replied Sibley. "Why?"\n"Well, I\'m writing a beautiful poem\nabout a lovely girl nud a handsome\nyoung man sitting on the fence there\nin the gloaming making love."\n"That\'s impossible," protested Sibley.\n"Why?" inquired Williams indignant\nly. "Are the young men and women of\nnorthern New York so cold blooded that\nthey do not make love In the gloam\ning?"\n"No," snickered Sibley, "but the\nfenee you\'re putting In the poem is\nmade of barbed wire."\nEasily Explained.\nDr. Edward Brooks, superintendent\nof the public schools, was asked by one\nof his little friends In Overbrook to lis\nten to the latter\'s rehearsal of a lesson\nIn which there was n reference to At\nlas, says the Philadelphia Ledger.\n"Do you know who Atlas was?"\nasked I)r.

"Well, tell\nme who supported Atlas."\nThe little fellow looked as though he\nhad not given the subject any particu\nlar attention, but showed Immediate\nwillingness to think It over.

"His ex\ncellency," replied the fiunky, almost\ndumfounded at the sight of the im\nperial visitor, "is in bed." "Good," was\nthe emperor\'s answer; "I will see him\nthere." Mounting the stairs two at a\ntime the emperor entered the sleeping\napartments of the ambassador, whom\nhe found peacefully slumbering, with\none arm hanging over the bed. This\narm the emperor seized and heartily\nshook. The diplomatist opened his eyes\nand on seeing the emperor bending over\nhim concluded that he was still dream\ning. lie was, however, quickly con\nvinced of his error and half an hour\nlater was observed in 110 more impress\nive garments than his sleeping suit\nand dressing gown escorting the laugh\ning monarch down the stairs.\nConibinf ii£ the Two.\nWhen Chaplain llubbard, United\nStates army, retired, was stationed at\nFort Buford, N.

OB——\nHER FIRST SIOO. -\nWhat the Delightful Creature Did\nWith It After Much Advice.\nHow she acquired it it does not really,\nmatter—possibly by teaching school,\npainting tire screens or washing. Any\nway when she found herself in posses\nsion of the sum she set about to see\nwhat she could do with it.\nCertain amiable friends told her it\nwould be very nice to buy some new\ndresses, hats, gloves, shoes and such.\nBut she had a full assortment and\ndidn\'t require anything of the sort. An\naunt told her to invest it in a certain\ntelegraph stock that would bring in\ngood interest.\n"But I want my hundred dollars all\nto myself, you know."\n"Poor, foolish dear, it will all be\nyours. Just the same. You can use the\ninterest just the same. I know where\nyou can draw—why, G per cent"\n"Wh-at? That is only $G a year!\nSix dollars Is awfully small by the\nside of this. I\'m going to count it\nagain. Maybe some of it is gone."\nThe very thought of such a thing made\nthe little creature chatter. For the\ntenth time that day she sat down and\ncounted the talisinanic roll of bills\nfour twenties, one ten and two fives.\nIt was all right, and her pulse re\nsumed its normal beat. Suddenly she\ngave a little shriek of delight and\nJumped up and cried:\n"I know just what I shall do! I\'ll\nget it—busted. I think that\'s what they\ncall"—\n"Child, what are you talking about?"\n"Talking about llnauce, auntie. I\'m\ngoing to make this stingy little roll into\na big one. It doesn\'t show off at all."\n"You are queer, dear."\n"I\'m going to get it all in five dollar\nbills. I think the pictures on the fives\nare ever so much prettier." Life seemed\nmore rosy after the delightful creature\npossessed twenty nice, crisp fivers. She\ncounted\' and recounted them when an\nother fancy came.\n"I\'m tired looking at these common\nbills. They don\'t jingle and ring. I\'m\ngoing to get five nice, clean, new twen\nty dollar goldpieces." No sooner was\nit said than done. The table rang for\ntwo days as she tossed the bright yel\nlow pieces about like Jack stones. Even\nthen she wasn\'t quite happy. The lit\ntle pile of twenty dollar yellow boys\nlooked so small. Then she scouted\nabout and got together 100 silver dol\nlars. She polished every one daily and\nplayed with them. Next she got 200\nfifty cent pieces. But life was still an\naching void. She at last owned SIOO\nin twenty-five cent coins. Surely she\nmust be satisfied nowi But, no; she\nbroke into one of the quarters, felt dis\ncouraged after that and was quite un\nlike her old self until she found one\nlittle nickel left, the very last coin of\nthe hundred dollars that had caused\nI her so much trouble.

Crockett and Ilotvle and a\nKeitleeted American Epic.\nThe late Frank Norris in an article\nIn Worltl\'s Work says that the Ameri\ncan epic, which on the shelves of pos\nterity should have stood shoulder to\nshoulder with the "Heinskringla" and\nthe "Tales of the Nibelungen" and the\n"Song of Roland," will never be writ\nten because the llector of an ignored\n"Iliad" has been forgotten. "One of the\nrequirements of an epic—a true epic—is\nthat its action must devolve upon some\ngreat national event There was no\nlack of such in those fierce years after\nforty-nine. Just that long uiul terrible\nJourney from the Mississippi to the\nocean is an cpie in itself. Yet no seri\nous attempt has ever been made by an\nAmerican author to render into prose\nor verse this event in our history as\n\'national\' in scope, in origin and in\nresults as the Revolution itself. The\nprairie schooner is as large a figure in\nthe legends as the black ship that bore\nUlysses homeward from Troy. The\nsea meant as much to the Argonauts of\nthe fifties as it did to the ten thousand.\n"And the Alamo! There is a trumpet\ncall la the word, and only the look of\nit 011 the printed page is a Hash of fire,\nbut the very histories slight the deed,\nand to many an American born under\nthe same flag that the Mexican rifies\nshot to ribbons on that splendid day\nthe word is meuulugless. Yet Ther\nmopylae was less glorious, and in com\nparison with that siege the investment\nof Troy was mere wanton riot. At the\nvery least the Texans in that battered\nadobe churcb fougbt for the honor of\ntheir flag and the greater glory of their\ncountry, not for loot, or the possession\nof the person of an adulteress. Young\nmen are taught to consider the "Iliad,"\nwith its butcheries, its glorification of\ninordinate selfishness and vanity, as a\nclassic. Achilles—murderer, egotist, ruf\nfian and liar—is a hero. But the name\nof Bowie, the name of the man who\ngave his life to his flag at the Ala\nmo, is perpetuated only in the des\nignation of a knife. Crockett is the\nhero only of u \'funny story\' about a sa\ngacious coon, while Travis, the boy\ncommander who did what Gordon with\nan empire back of him failed to do, is\nquietly and definitely ignored. He died\nin defense of an ideal, an epic hero, u\nlegendary figure, formidable, sad. lie\ndied facing down injustice, dishonesty\nand crime; died \'in his boots,\' and the\nsame world that has glorified Achilles\nand frgotten Travis finds none so poor\nto do him reverence."\nNeedier Alarm.\nI>angerous things look safe, and safe\nthings look dangerous. The trouble is\nall in the beholder\'s eye, as the common\nexpression is. An Englishman was 011\na voyage to Spain.\nShips were flying by of varying\nshape, rig and color. One, the English\nman noticed, was bearing slowly down\ntoward him, with her cargo piled 011\ndeck half way up the masts. What\ncould she be? Ilow could she lioi>o,\nladen in this way, to live ont the faint\nest suspiciou of a gale?\nThe English traveler was consider\nably exercised about her. Something\nsurely ought to he done to make such\nrascally "deck loading" illegal and iiu-\nI possible. He scanned the vessel with\nhis glass. The breeze was light, but\nslie rode buoyantly. At last a sailor\ncleared lip the mystery.\n"Why, sir," he said bluntly, "she\'s\nonly u coaster loaded with cork."\nAdvnntnKi\' of Advertlainff.\n"Will you allow me to ask you a\nquestion?" Interrupted a man in the\naudience.\n"Certainly, sir," said the spellbinder.\n"You have been giving us a lot of\nfigures about immigration, increase in\nwealth and all that," said the man.\n"Let\'s see what you know about fig\nures yourself. How do you find the\ngreatest common divisor?"\nSlowly and deliberately the orator\ntook a drink of water.\nThen he pointed ids finger at the\n; questioner, lightning flashed from his\nI eyes, and he replied in a voice that\nmade the gas Jets quiver:\n"Advertise for it, you ignoramus!"—\nChicago Tribune.\nRead - the - Tribune.\nMr, Jones\'\nValentine\nStory\nCy HOWARD FIELDING\nCcrpyriQhU 190?, bj/ Charles XT. Tlooke\nTHE young author seated himself\nwith that nonchalance which\nmay be expected in one who is\nintroduced by the editor in\nchief to the mere editor of a depart\nment. He scratched a match upon the\nside of my desk—it really is mine and\nnot the establishment\'s—and lighted\none of those Egyptian cigarettes which\nsmell like an early spring bonfire in\nMaggie Murphy\'s back yard.\n"What kind of stuff do you want?"\nhe inquired.\n"I\'d take a good valentine story,"\nsaid I.\nAt that my visitor assumed a smile\nsuggesting the early stages of seasick\nuess.\n"Oh, I say," said he in a tone of lan\nguid protest, "that sort of thing\'s\nplayed out, don\'t you think? Who\neares about valentines? There\'s no ro\nmance in them any more. In society,\npeople notice the day at all, they\nsend flowers, not picture cards."\n"Our circulation exceeds 400," said I.\n"We have outgrown society. Give us\nsomething about young men and wo\nmen."\nThe talented author blew a greeu\nEgyptian cloud into the air and slowly\nshook his head.\n"I don\'t see anything in it," he de\nclared. "The valentine is a dead issue."\nNow, though I had never met young\nMr. Breck before that day, I had read\nsome of his stuff, and I knew that he\ncould do good work. Ho was a western\nproduct, and such of his stories as I\nhad seen were as full of spirit as an\nunbroken pony. Eastern civilization\nseemed to have taken the life out of\nhim with astonishing rapidity, or it\nmay have been the Egyptian ciga\nrettes. I was conscious of a sort of\nrage against him, partly because bis\naffected manner was such a disappoint\nment to me, but chiefly perhaps he\ncause lie had treated my commonplace,\nold fashioned notion with contempt.\n"We\'re going to have a lot of valen\ntine stuff in the issue of Feb. 13," said\nI, "and most of it is rattling good, hut\nof course if it doesn\'t appeal to you"—\nBreck waved the reeking cigarette\nbefore my eyes as if in some form of\nIncantation, and, having reduced me to\nsilence by this, he said:\n"You run the supplement, I\'m told—\nthe literary and artistic end of the pa\nper?"\n"That\'s what I\'m here for," I replied.\nHe shook his head very sadly and\nmuttered:\n"Valentine stories! Good Lord!"\n"Why, what\'s the matter?" I in\nquired.\n"Now, look here," said he. "I try to\nkeep pretty close to life; to write the\nthing that is and not the dream. Do I\nmake myself clear? Well, such being\nthe case, let me ask you one question.\nIn the last ten years have you known\nor heard of any human creature who\nhas attached any serious importance to\na valentine or had any really romantic\nadventure connected with one?"\n"Yes, sir; I have," said I.\nHe shook his head slowly and sadly.\nI could have cuffed him for that inso\nlence, and yet his question, his method\nof getting at the matter, appealed to\nme.\n"I will spin you a little yarn," said I;\n"a true yarn and not a bad one."\n"Delighted," said he, lying back in\nhis chair and closing his eyes, while\n~i W^^dt\nHE LAY BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND CLOSED\nHIS EYES.\nthe smoke from his cigarette, now\npointing straight upward, ascended to\nthe ceiling and seemed to stick there.\n"This happened to a fellow named\nJones," said I. "He was a newspaper\ncorrespondent in the Philippines. He\nhad been out there six months and\nhadn\'t hud a letter from a gill."\n"Particular girl?" queried Breck.\n"Any girl," I replied. "There was a\nparticular girl; not so very particular\neither, and yet he\'d have been mighty\nglad if she had remembered liim on the\nother side of the world. Most fellows,\nof course, would have found a romance\nof some kind suited to their individual\ntastes and fancies out there, but Jones\ndidn\'t have the luck. I don\'t know that\nhe was a particularly sentimental fel\nlow, yet it seemed rather hard to him\nthat there shouldn\'t be a girl sorne\nwhere who cared for him to the extent\nrepresented by the moderate price of\npostage. He said It was as if he had\ndied unlamented and was Just finding\nit out in the other world.\n"He\'d been brought up in a little, so\nciable city where everybody knew ev\nery body else, and though he no longer\nhad any close relatives there—very few,\nindeed, on earth—there were his old\nfriends, including some very nice girls,\nwhom he had traveled a hundred miles\nout of his way to say goodby to just\nbefore leaving his native land. They\'d\nall promised to write to him"—\n"Including the girl?" said Beck.\n"Yes," said I. "And the fact is that\na considerable package of mall for him,\nsent through the publishers whom lie\nrepresented, and tardily forwarded, had\ngone to the bottom of the Pacific ocean,\nbut he didn\'t know that.\n"In Manila he met a young fellow\nnamed George Templeton, from the\nsame town as himself. Templeton had\nnot been bred in the first circles, and\nhis early reputation for industry and\nsobriety was not of the best. Jones\nhad ra tlier looked down upon him. and\nTempleton, no doubt, had found some\nreason for looking down upon Jones.\nHE SAT THERE ALL MIGHT.\nIt\'s a privilege never denied a freeborn\nAmerican. However, they became\nfriends in Manila because it was so far\nfrom home.\n"Templeton was a serjfeant of volun\nteers and a homesick soldier if ever\nthere was one. He excited Jones\' sym\npathy, which became acute when\nJones learned that there was a girl at\nhome who had stopped writing to Tem\npleton for an unknown reason. This\nIs a serious matter when a fellow real\nly eares for the girl and she is 10,000\nmiles away and there\'s no method of\nlearning why she no longer writes.\nFancy waiting for a letter to go half\nway around the world and for the re\nply to come loitering back or not to\ncome at all! Templeton was not nat\nurally sensitive, but the experience\nhad made him so. He told his secret\ngrudgingly because it was forced out\nof him, but he never revealed the name\nof the girl.\n"In the latter part of January Tem\npleton\'s compdny was sent up into the\nInterior to a little forsaken village\nwhere there was a peck of trouble. A\nmail steamer came in the day before\nthe detachment marched, but it\nbrought no letter to Templeton. The\npoor fellow revealed this misfortune to\nJones with tears in his eyes. He seemed\nto think that this was his last chance.\n"A few days later Jones learned en\ntirely by accident that a letter for\nTempleton had really come on the\nsteamer and had been delivered by\nmistake to a surgeon of the same sur\nname. The addressed side of the letter\nhad been, wet, and tlie ink was a mere\nblot, so that the word Templeton was\nabout all that could be deciphered.\nThe surgeon, however, detected the\ngiven name of \'George\' and did not\nopen the letter.\n"Jones had laid it in his mind to try\nto get through to this place where the\ntrouble was. lie thought he saw a good\nstory in it. He told the surgeon of his\nintention and was permitted to take\nthe letter. By pulling all kinds of\nwires lie got leave to join a small par\nty that was going up with dispatches,\nand the result was that he hud adven\ntures enough to fill a book. The party\ngot through alive, but every man of\nthem was wounded, including Jones,\nwho made the last forty miles of the\njourney practically on one leg. But\nTenipleton\'s letter—which lie was\nmorally convinced was the letter—re\nposed in liis breast pocket when he\nstaggered into camp.\n"He found Templeton flat on his hack\nand raving with fever in a quaint cen\ntury old church that had been turned\ninto a hospital. The surgeon in charge\ntold Jones that it was practically all\nover; the man was as good as dead.\n\'Will he be conscious again?\' asked\nJones. And the surgeon said that it\nwas possible.\n\'"When is it likely to happen?\'\n" \'Heaven knows,\' answered the sur\ngeon.\n" \'l\'ll wait,\' said Jones. And he sat |\ndown on the foot of the bed. His |\nwound was dressed and he was fed \'\nwhile he sat there. Of course they j\ntried to take him away, but he wouldn\'t\ngo, and as everybody was pretty busy\nhe was presently forgotten.\n"He sat there all night, sometimes in\nthat conscious sleep which is the prod- i\nnot of physical weariness and mental j\nconcentration fighting for supremacy. \'\nHe was half crazy from a dozen\ncauses, and he held that letter iu his I\nhand every minute.\n"It seemed to him that by continual j\nfeeling of it while in that peculiar men- |\ntal state he gained an idea of what\nwas in it. and at times he felt ashamed\nof knowing. The envelope was square,\n•ml there was a hard iuclosure that\nseemed like u small photograph. But I\nafter awhile Jones became aware that\nthe fdges of this card were ornamen\ntally Irregular, and then he knew what\nIt was. The thing was a valentine,\nand It had traveled many, many miles\n—a fed latterly by a route never intend\ned ?y the reach this dying\nman in time. The date, in fact, was in\nadvance of the saint\'s day. It was the\nnight of Feb. 11.\n"Templeton raved and tossed, and he\nsaid some things that might go to a\nfeeling man\'s heart, considering the\ncircumstances, but he mentioned no\nname. About 3 o\'clock he became\nquiet, and from that hour till morning\nhe seemed to be sinking down to death.\nThen he stirred and half raised him\nself.\n" \'Hello, Jones!\' said he. \'Where did\nyou come from?\'\n" \'l\'ve got a letter for you, George,*\nwas the reply. \'lt came after you left.\'\n" \'Give it to me,\' said Templeton, ex\ntending a weak, thin hand.\n"He took the letter and raised it to\nhis breast as he sank back against the\npillow. Jones waited, but Templeton\ndid not move. He lay there smiling,\nwith the letter on his breast. The man\nwas dead.\n" \'This is a valentine that some one\nhas sent to him from home,\' said Jones\nwhen the surgeon came. \'I think we\nought to bury it with hiip.\'\n" \'How do you know what it is?\'\nasked the surgeon.\n"Jones could not answer.\n" \'We ought to open it,\' said the doc\ntor. \'in order to communicate with the\nwriter. Some one might want to know\nthat he got it.\'\n"He took the envelope out of the dead\nman\'s hand and opened it after some\nhesitation.\n" \'Dear George,\' he rend in a whisper,\n\'mail this to Frank Jones if you know\nwhere he Is. and never tell him who\nsent it. I don\'t know how to address\nhim, but you can find out.\'\n" \'That\'s mine,\' said Jones, in a\ndream.\n"The doctor put the iuclosure into his\nhands. It was in a separate envelope,\nunaddressed.\n" \'This is a friendly letter from a\nmighty fine girl.\' said the doctor. \'l\'d\nlike to take something of this kind with\nme when 1 go.\'\n"He put it back Into its envelope and\nlaid it inside the rough woolen shirt\nwhich was the dead man\'s garment.\n" \'He has delivered your message, lit\ntle girl,* said lie, \'and he\'ll never tell\nwho sent it.\'\n"So that\'s the whole story. Jones has\ncome back to this country, and he has\nthat valentine—a pretty card with a lit\ntle love verse on it, but not a scrap of\nwriting. He doesn\'t know who sent it.\nbut if he did I think he would find that\ngirl. I feel quite sure that he would\nfind that girl."\n"Not bad, as such things go," said\nBreck, rising, "but conventional."\n"Conventional be — I beg your par\ndon," said I. "Why, the thing is true."\n"I don\'t see that that helps It any,"\nreplied Breck. "However, thnt\'s nei\nther here nor there. I\'m hard up, and\nif a valentine story\'s what you want\n"THAT\'S MINE," SAID JONES.\nI\'ll go home and see what I can do for\nyou. By the way. it wasn\'t Temple\nton\'s girl, of course?"\n"The one who sent the valentine?\nCertainly not," I replied. "When Jones\ngot back to this country, lie looked up\nTenipleton\'s affairs a hit to see wheth\n< r lie could do anything for his family\nand that sort of thing, and he happened\nto discover that the girl for whose let\nter he had waited was really waiting\nfor him—waiting, as 1 have faith to be\nlieve, very near that rude church in\nLuzon where the man closed his eyes\nso happily to open the eyes of his soul\nnext moment in her presence."\n"You mean she had died?" said\nBreck.\n"Precisely," I replied.\n"And Joues hasn\'t found the otie girl\nwho remembered him upon the far side\nof the world?"\n"No," said I, "but he will."\nBreck lighted another of his deadly\ncigarettes.\n"Why can\'t I write this thing for\nyou?" he Inquired.\n"Not for your life, my friend." said I.\nlie stared through the first great\ncloud of smoke.\n"Why not?" he demanded.\n"Because I\'m \'Joues,\'" said I, "and\nat present \'.lie matter is sacredly confi\ndential. When I have found that girl, I\nshall write the story myself."\nHe WAN Rlxht.\nCromwell stood moodily watching the\nbattle of Naseby.\n"Why so downcast?" inquired his\ngenerals. "Aren\'t we making glorious\nhistory?"\n"Not much!" cried Oliver. "We\'re\nonly furnishing material for some fool\nnovelist."\nWith an imprecation on posterity he\nrushed oft\' to dictate his terms of sur\nrender.—Judge.\nRAILROAD TIMETABLES\nLEHIGH VALLEY RAILROAD.\nNovember 16, 1902.\nARRANGEMENT or PASSENGER TRAINS.\nLEAVE FKBELANJ).\n0 12 a ra for Weatherly, Mauch Chunk\nAllentown, Bethlehem, Easton, Phila\ndelphia and New York.\n7 29 a in for Sandy Hun, White Haven,\nWilkes-Barre, Pittston and Scranton.\n8 15 a in for Hazleton, Weatherly, Mauch\nChunk.
