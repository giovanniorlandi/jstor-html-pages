Tho es\ntimatcs of its size vary considerably\naceording to circuinstanccs, but\nwhcn inoderately full about 20 by 7\nmilcs will be found tolerably cor\nrcct. At eithcr end thc land is\nfully 100 feet above thc highest\nrecorded surfnec of the lake, which\npossespes no known outlet, nlthough\nit is fcd by nuinerous inounlain\ncrceks.\nThc lake wns discovcred by n\nbushmnn in 18S0 nnd wns known to\ntho bhicks as the "big water." It\nwas then supposetl to form thc\nsourcc of a river having its mouth\n011 the south coast, but subsequent\nvisitors wero nuich iicrplcxed at the\nmanner in which tho hlaeks avoided\ntho lake, of which they appeared to\ncntertain a superstitious dread, ono\nnged ahoriginnl stating she had scen\nit all covcrcd with tree., nnothor\ncxplaining that the wholo of the\nwalcr sank through the bottom and\ndisappeared, while others rcmcm\nbered thc lnke only as a series of\nsmall ponds.\nDuring tho following twenty\nyears considcrablo variations were\nnotcd in thc depth and extent of\nthc lake. In 1841 tho lake bccamo\npartially dricd up, tho moist por\ntions being simply grassy swamps.\nA few inonths latcr largc numbcrs\nof sheep were pasturcd in the bcd\nof the lake, but frcsh water had to\nbe cartcd for thc use of the shop-\nherds, that of thc lake being too\nsalt for luunnn consumption. The\nplaco rcinained niorc or less dry\nuntil 18")2, the ycar of tho grca\'t\nfloods in that part of thc colony,\nwhcn it again bccamo fillcd, with\nan averago depth of nino feet.\nSinco then the surfaco lcvcl of tho\nlake has varied considerably, but\ntho bed has nevcr bccn so dry ns in\nfornicr years. Thero nrc indica\ntions that many hundreds of years\nago tho lake covcrcd a far largcr\narca than any yet recorded, rcmains\nof trees over 100 years old being\nfound in spots formcrly under\nwater. Thc saline chnractcr of tho\nlako is thc moro remarkable by rea\nEon of its heing fcd by pure nnd\nsparkling frcsh water strcams.
