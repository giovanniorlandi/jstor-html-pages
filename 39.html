The people of both, couDtrlw receive sore hurts, and no one Is, benefited by the operation. The United, States, with great care and pains, ar, ranees Its customs duties In such a prohib, itive wav that the people of that country, cannot enjoy the benefit of anvthlng pro, duced In Canada, and the Canadian gov, emment enforces regulations by which tht, people of this country are prevented from, taking advantage of the gifts of modem, Invention aod civilization across the bor, dtr.

Their need, of assistance Is real aod the sources frjit, which aid for the distressed u?u llv comes, are much narrowed on account of a fear, that the contributions might be construed, as an indorsement of the strike.

While I fully understand, \' that to entirely Ignore that editorial effort, would be the only correct thing to do, I, find It rather too difficult to quietly sub, mit to being classed, In a class of our own,, beneath that of the American Negro., After making repeated Inquiries i am con, vinced that only a few of the soldiers of, the post were, on this particular nlnht. or, other nights, falling to conduct themselves, (?\'soldiers should.
