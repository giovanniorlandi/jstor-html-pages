        <pre>['The Writings of William F. Russell \nLAWRENCE A. CREMIN \nPROFESSOR OF EDUCATION, TEACHERS COLLEGE \nCLARA ESTHER DERRING \nSUPERVISING LIBRARIAN, REFERENCE DEPARTMENT, TEACHERS COLLEGE \n \nRARELY does one look to an educator\'s \nadministrative papers for the distillate of his \nprofessional wisdom. Yet William F. \nRussell\'s twenty-seven annual reports to the \nTrustees of Teachers College not only hold \nthe key to his educational thought, they \nmake quite remarkable reading in their own \nright. They range in subject from the internal \nproblems of a large faculty to the deepest \nrelationships between education and \npolitics. The most limited in scope are never \nparochial, while those of greatest breadth \nare inevitably directed to gnawing questions \nof educational practice. Throughout they are \nbound together by a common sounding of \nthe classical theme that he who would \neducate must first ponder what it is to live \nwell. \n \nThe theme is no surprise, considering \nRussell\'s background, training, and \ntemperament. He had literally grown up with \nTeachers College and American education. \nThrough his boyhood home had come a \nprocession of notables from every domain of \nthe educational world. He had attended the \nHorace Mann elementary school when it \nwas still housed in the upper floors of the \nTeachers College Main Hall and had been \ngraduated from the high school soon after \nHorace Mann had moved to its new building \non 120th Street and Broadway. Upon \nfinishing his undergraduate studies in history \nat Cornell, he had taught for two years in \nColorado, returning to Teachers College in \n1912 to complete his work for the Ph. D. \ndegree. Thereafter, in connection with posts \nat the George Peabody College for \nTeachers and the State University of Iowa, \nhe had travelled widely in Europe and Asia \non a variety of educational missions. When \nhe returned to Teachers College in 1923 as \nprofessor of education and associate \ndirector of the recently formed International \nInstitute, his record as an educator of stature \nwas already impressive. Four years later he \nsucceeded his father as dean, holding the \npost through the turmoil of depression, war, \nand postwar readjustment. After a short term \nin the newly created presidency of Teachers \nCollege, he retired in 1954, not to mellow \nyears of elder statesmanship but to the \ndemanding executive post at the \nInternational Cooperation Administration in \nwhich he was actively serving at the time of \nhis death. \n \nEven a hasty perusal of Russell\'s writing \nindicates a fascinating catholicity of \neducational interest. He was first and \nforemost an interpreter of American \neducation, dealing repeatedly with such \ngrand themes as democracy, liberty, \nequality, and discipline as they bear on the \nwork of American schools. His concerns \nranged from the nursery school to the \nuniversity, from preparation for citizenship to \nthe maintenance of good health, from the \napprentice training of the adolescent to the \nproper use of adult leisure. As early as 1918 \nhe published a long essay on "Education in \nthe United States of America" in Peter \nSandiford\'s volume on Comparative \nEducation, and his interest in the critical \ninterpretation of American education never \nwaned. \n \nThere is another sense, however, in which \nthis early essay in the Sandiford volume is \nperhaps even more significant. Throughout \nhis life, Russell was intrigued with the \nmethod of comparative education. His forte \nwas not so much the compilation of data \nabout foreign educational systems, although \nhis Schools in Bulgaria provides a fine \nexample of pioneering work in this field. \nRather, he excelled in his ability to apply his \ncomparative studies not only in \nunderstanding and improving American \neducation but in sensitizing American \neducators to the international dimensions of \ntheir work. Here more than anywhere, \nperhaps, contemporary comparative \neducators may learn from Russell; for the \nfailure so to apply their data is too frequently \nthe salient weakness of their discipline. \n', ' \nIn the field of history, too, Russell put his \nknowledge to work. For him good history \ncould never be mere chronicle; it had to \nilluminate the present and the future. And \ninterested as he was in the relation of \neducation and politics, his lifelong \nfascination with the French and American \nrevolutions served him in good stead. He \npeppered his writings with allusions to \nWashington, Jefferson, Colbert, Napoleon, \nPitt, and Castlereagh, and whether or not \none agreed with his interpretations of the \neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, his \nanalyses inevitably cut deep. Little wonder \nthat his discussions of citizenship education \nwent far beyond the all-too-usual cant about \nmemorizing the Declaration of \nIndependence and voting on Election Day. \n \nGranted these more cosmic interests, \nRussell never disdained the organizational, \nadministrative, or financial aspects of \neducation. Hence his frequent essays \ndealing with the relationship of quality, \nquantity, and economy in education; with the \nbearing of a nation\'s political commitments \non its educational administration; with \nfederal aid as a solution to the financial \nproblems of American education; and with \nthe impact of industrialism on the \norganization of American schools. \nFurthermore, at no point in his consideration \nof organizational matters did he ever lose \nsight of the elemental fact that no school is \nbetter than its teachers. He worked tirelessly \nto improve the education of teachers and the \nconditions under which they labored. In \nreading his essays, it is frequently a matter \nof delight to see his artistry in taking an \nabstruse discussion of some philosophical \nor ideological issue and pointing out its clear \nrelevance for professional education. \nMoreover, he was able effectively to \ncombine this interest in teachers with his \ndeeply held commitment to internationalism; \nthe result was the World Organization of the \nTeaching Profession, organized largely \nthrough his efforts and of which he was first \npresident. \n \nOne is impressed, throughout, with the \npungency of Russell\'s prose, a pungency \nwhich was so much an extension of his \npersonal forthrightness. Consider, for \nexample, several of his titles: "Where Are \nWe Going and Are We on the Way?"; "How \nto Tell a Communist and How to Beat Him"; \n"Public Education and the Depression: Must \nOur Children Share?"; or "Education, a \nLiberty We Prize and a Right We Will \nMaintain." Perhaps they leave too little to the \nimagination; but in a field notorious for its \njargon, they are a breath of rhetorical fresh \nair. One is impressed, too, with the variety of \njournals —popular and scholarly—which \ncarried his articles. To address classroom \nteachers and the public, as well as the world \nof high scholarship, one must publish in \nmagazines read by classroom teachers and \nthe public—and in prose that will command \ntheir interest. William F. Russell had a knack \nfor this; and it is no surprise that while others \nwere wringing their hands in the face of \npostwar educational criticism, he was writing \nhis last published book, Ho<w to Judge a \nSchool: A Handbook for Puzzled Parents \nand Tired Taxpayers. \n \nIn the final analysis, however, one is drawn \nconstantly to his annual reports. Here were \nthe man\'s most penetrating insights; here \nwas his most polished prose. It is said that \nhe worked uncommonly long and hard over \nthese essays; perhaps he himself had a \nsense that they would be his abiding \ntestament. The questions they pose are \nclassical; but their discussion is distinctly \nmodern. And while the hard political realities \nof the twentieth-century world condition their \nevery judgment, Russell\'s faith in education \npervades them all. One cannot read these \nreports and remain unmoved; they inevitably \ninvite comparison with a similar set of \nreports which a century earlier had stated so \nwell the case for the American public school.\n \nBOOKS AND PAMPHLETS \n \nAmerican Education.
