The Idaho Falls\nfarket opened in the autumn of\n1920 at $1.35 to $1.40 a 100\npounds for Idaho Rurals, but tow\nard the end of September declined\n«to $1.\nRussets brought $1.25\nThese Prices held during October.\n(During November, the demand im\nProved, and on the 16th Idaho Ru\n, ,, . ,, ,, r ...\nsold for $1.25 and Russets for\n*, , r D , .». , ,, .\nPrices then fell under hea\n,,, , ,,\nV supplies and the month closed at\n\'90 cents for Rurals and $1.10 for\nRussels. The decline continued un\ntil January 26-27, when the lowest\nprice of the season, 60 cents a 10 )\npounds for Idaho Rurals and 6o\nRussets, was reached. Dur\ning the latter part of January tha\nCalifornia demand for Russets be\ncame a big factor and continued to\ndominate the market throughout the\nremainder of the season.\nIdaho Rurals had to be sold in\nthe East in competition wtlh heavy\nshipfents from Wisconsin. Minneso\nta, and Michigan as well as Colora\ndo, and the small quantities of Ru\nrals shipped to Caiiforna points sold\nusually at 25 cents discount from\nthe price of Russets. On the other\nhand, the only competition that\nPunsets encountered in California\nmarkets was from the Stockton dis\ntrict and from Oregon and Wash\nington. The Stockton district had\nshipped nearly all its best stock \',y\nthe first of February, while the\nbulk of shipments frof Oregon and\nWashington went to British Colum\nbia, where there was almost a\nfailure. This made a very\nRusset market toward the end of\nthe season, Russets closing April 15\nat $1.25 to $1.35, with carlots cash\nto growers $1.40 to $1.45. Idaho\nRoyals closed at 90 cents for wagon\njauds and $1 for carload lots. As a\ngeneral rule, growers who sold their\nRurals early last season and held\ntheir Russets until toward spring\nrealized the highest returns.\ncrop\nactive\nGrading Service Benefit to Farmers\nMuch improvement Jn grading\nhas been effected through the ship\nping-point inspection service, al\nthough unfortunately in some in\nstances the growers have brought\ngreat pressure to bear upon the in\nspectors to have them relax inspec\ntion enough to pass stock not strict\nly up to the requirements of the\nUnited Staes grades. The trade\nwants clean, good stock: and uni\nform grading practices will do mucii\ntoward stumping the Idaho product\nI\nas one taht can be depended upon.\nOne of the big reasons why potato\ngrowers from other sections of the\ncoutnrty have been more successful\nin the past is that the high quality\nof their potatoes has resulted in a\ndemand for their product greater\nthan the supply. There is no reason\nwhy Idaho growers should not enjoy\nsimilar success, if they will grade,\npack, and ship their potatoes so ns\nto place them on the markets in first\nclass condition.\nUniform (»rades Advisable\nIt is only by the standardization\nof Idaho potatoes to conform to un\nifrm grades that any improvement j\nin marketing conditions can be ex\npected. Potatoes are shipped in\ncarload lots from practically every\nstate in the Union. Some of these\nstates grade to United States grades\nNo. 1 and No. 2; and i f Idaho\nstock is to compete successfully in\nthe markets it must show the same\nstandards of quality and condition\nIn years of short supplies and ac\ntive demand it is often possible to\nshould be more widely used. It is\neaid that one reason why California\npotatoes sell at bettter prices than\nIdaho stock is because they are gen\ne. ally packed in new cleean bags .\nThe Department suggests that\nwhere it is customary to fill the\nsell stock that Is not strictly up to\ngrade, but in seasons like the one\n) ist past, when supplies are heavy\nand the demand rather light and\ncritical, ungraded stock or stock\nfiightly off-grade, sells only at u\nsubstantial discount in price.\nAdvantage to Use Clean Bags\nNew, or at least sound, clean bags\nLags so full that the tops will not\nsew shut a cardboard with the\nwords IDAHO POTATOES printed\nin it be placed in the top of the bag\nto protect the potatoes from injurv\nfrom the twine. This adds to the\nattractiveness of the package also.\nThe old system of loading sacks in\nthe cars is rapidly giving way to im\nproved loading methods. The early\ncrop and the first of the late crop\ni rre now generally loaded with the\nsacks on end and with\nspace through the car.\nprogressive shippers load in the win\nter what is called a 2 1-2 built-up J\nload. The sacks are intermeshed !\nso that space of 12 to 18 inches is 1\nleft between the load and sides of j\nthe car.

Abe showed him the coin\nmission and asked him to sign It.\n"I\'ll sign on one condition," said\nSmoot.\n"What Is that?" Abe asked.\n"That you\'ll give me a commission.\nI want to he your friend."\n"You are that now, aren\'t you?"\nAl»e asked.\n"Yes. but I haven\'t earned ray com\nmission. You haven\'t given me a\nchance yet. What can 1 do to help\ny où along?"\nAhe was much Impressed by these\nkindly words.\n"My friends do not often ask what\nthey can do for me," he said. "1 sup\npose they haven\'t thought of It. I\'ll\nthink it over and let you know."\nThree days later he walked out to\nColeman Smoot\'s after supper. As\nthey sat together by the fireside Abe\nsaid ;\n"I\'ve been thinking of your friendly\nquestion. It\'s dangerous to talk that\nway to a man like me. The fact Is.\nI need two hundred dollars to pay\npressing debts and give me something\nIn my pocket when I go to Vandalla.\nIf you can not lend It to me I shall\nthink none the Jess of yon."\n"I can and will," said Smoot. "I\'ve\nbeen watching you for a long time. A\nman who tries as hard ns you do to\nget along deserves to be helped. I be\nlieve in you. I\'ll go up to Springfield\nand get the money and bring It to you\nwithin a week or so."\nAbe Lincoln l.ad many fr\'ends who\nwould have done the like for him If\nthey could, and he knew It.\n"Every one has faith in you," said\nSmoot. "We expect much of you and\nwe ought to be willing to do what\nwe can to help."\n"Your faith will be my strength. If\nI have any," said Abe.\nOn bis way home that night he\nthought of what Jack Kelso had said\nof democracy and friendship.\nOn the twenty-second of November\na letter came to Ann from Btm KeJso.\nwhich announced that she was going\nto New Orleans for the winter with\nher husband. Six days later Abe took\nthe stage for the capital, at Rutledge\'s\ndoor, where all the Inhabitants of the\nvillage had assembled to bid him good\nw\nm\n(|Æ\nMm\nn\n■1\nI fl]\nF 1\n>\ni\nThe Vil\'age Had Assembled to Bid\nHim Goodby.\nby. Ann Rutledge, with a flash of her\nold playfulness, kissed him when he\ngot into the stage. Abe\'s long arm\nwas waving in the air as he looked\nback at his cheering friends while the\nstage rumbled down the road toward\nthe great task of life upon which he\nwas presently to begin In the Jittle\nvillage of Vandalla.\nCHAPTER XIII,\nWherein the Route of the Under,\nground Railroad Is Surveyed and\nSamton and Harry Spend a Night\nin the Home of Henry Brlmstead\nand Hear Surprising Revelation«,\nConfidentially Disclosed.\nS\nEarly in the autumn of that year\nthe Reverend Elijah Lovejoy of Al\nton had spent a night with the Tray\nlors on his way to the North. Sitting\nby the fireside he had told many a\nvivid *»\'e of the cruelties of slavery\n"1 would not have yon think that\n• fc ~i»» , der* are wicked and hear.\nless," he said. "They are like other\nmen the world over. Some are kind\nand indulgent. If all men were like\nthem slavery could he tolerated. Hut\nthey are not. Some men are brutal\nIn tlie North as well ns in the South.\nIf not made so by nature they are\nmade so by drink. To give them the\npower of life and death over human\nbeings, which they seetu to have In\nparts of the South, is a crime against\n<!od and civilization."\n"I agree with you." said Samson.\n"I knew that you would." the min\nister went on. "We have already hail\nsome help from you but we need more.\nI take It us a duty which Cod has\nlaid u|kjii me lo help »very fugitive\nthat reaches my door. You can help\nthe good work of mercy and grace.\nIf you hear three taps upon your win\ndow after da>-k or the hoot of an owl\nin your dooryard you will know what\nIt means. Fix some place on your\nfarm where tl ese poor people who are\nseeking the freedom which Cod wills\nfor all Ills children, may find rest and\nrefreshment anil security until they\nhave strength iu go on."\nWithin a week after the visit of\nMr. Lovejoy, Samson and Hurry built\na hollow haystack about half-way from\nI he house to the barn. The stuck had\na comfortable room Inside of It about\neight feet by seven and some six feet\niu heigh,. Its entrance was an open\ning near the bottom of the stack well\nscreened by the pendant hay. But no\nfugitive came to occupy It that winter.\nSoon after the new year of 1823\nSamson and Hurry moved the Kelsus\nto Tazewell county. Mr. Kelso hud\nreceived an appointment as land agent\nand was to he stationed at the little\nsett lenient of Hopi uuie near the home\nof John I\'eusley.\nLate in the afternoon Harry and\nSamson left the Kelsos and their ef\nfects at a small frame house in the\nlittle village of HopeduJe. The men\nhud no sooner begun to unload than\nIts inhabitants came to welcome the\nnewcomers and help them In the work\nof getting settled. When the goods\nwere deposited In the dooryard Sum\nson and Harry drove to John Beas\nley\'s farm. Mr. Beasley recognized\nthe big, broad-shouldered Vermonter\nat the first look.\n"Do 1 remember you 7" he said.\n"Well, I guess I do. So does my barn\ndoor. Let me take hold of that right\nhand of yours again. Y\'es, sir. It\'s the\nsame old Iron hand. Marry Ann!" he\ncalled as his wife came out of the\ndoor. "Here\'s the big man from Ver\ngennes who tossed the party slaver."\n"I see It Is,\'\' she answered. "Ain\'t\nye cornin\' In?"\n"If you try to pass this place I\'ll\nhave ye took up," said Beasley.\n"There\'s plenty of foot) in the house\nan\' stable."\n"I-ook here—that\'s downright self\nish," said his wife. "If we tried to\nkeep you here Henry Brlmstead would\nnever forgive us. He talks about you\nmorning, noon and night. Any one\nwould think that you was the Samson\nthat slew the Bhlllstines."\n"How Is Henry?" Samson asked.\n"He married my sister N and they\'re\nabout ns happy as they can be this\nside the river Jordan." she went on.\n"They\'ve got one o\' the best farms\nIn Tazewell county and they\'re goin\'\nto be rich."\n"Yes. «Ir; I didn\'t think o\' that."\nsaid Beasley. "Henry and hls wife\nwould holler If we didn\'t lake ye over\nthere. It\'s only a quarter of a mile.\nI\'ll show ye the way and we\'ll all\ncome over this evening and have a\ntalkin\' bee."\nSamson was pleased and astonished\nby the look of Brlmstead and hls\nhome and hi* family end the account\nof his success. The man from the\nsand fiats was cleanly shaved, save\nfor a black mustache, and neatly\ndressed and hls face glowed with\nhealth and high spirits. A handsome\nbrown-eyed miss of seventeen came\ngalloping up the road on her pony\nand «topped near them.\n"Annabel, do you remember this\nman?" Brlmstead asked.\nThe girl looked at Samson.\n"He Is the man who helped ns our\nof Flea valley," said the girl. "Would\nyou mind if Z kissed you?"\n"I would be sorry If you didn\'t."\nsaid Samson. "Here\'s my boy, Harry\nNeedles. You wouldn\'t dare kiss him,\nI- guess."\n"I would he sorry, too, if you didn\'t,"\nHarry laughed as he took her hand.\n"I\'m afraid you\'ll have to stay sor\nry.\'\' said Annabel turning red with\nembarrassment. "1 never saw you be\nfore."\n"Belter late than never." Samson\nassured her. "You don\'t often see a\nbetter fellow."\nThe girl laughed with a subtle look\nof agreement In her eyes. Then came\nup from the barn the ragged little\nlad of No Santa Claus Land—now a\nsturdy, bright-eyed, handsome boy of\ntwelve.\nwe need on these j\n"Something j\nThe horses were put out and all\nwent in to supper.\nAfter supper Brlmstead showed\nmodels of a mowing machine with a\ncut liar six feet long, and a plow\nvh\'cb would turn two furrows.\n"That\'s what\n•ralrles." said Ramson.\nthat\'ll turn \'em oyer and cut the cron\nquicker."\n"Say.

Out\nriver Isn\'t navigable yet We hop«\nthat Ahe Lincoln, who has Just lieen\nelected to the legislature, will he abl«\nto get It widened and straightened\nand cleaned up so It will be of some\nuse to us down there."\n"I\'ve heard of him.

"There\'s\nnobody here of ray age but Lanky Pet\ners, who looks like a fish, and a red\nheaded Irish boy with a wooden leg."\nThe Peasleys arrived and the men\nand women spent a delightful hour\ntraveling without weariness over the\nlong trull to beloved scenes and the\ndays of their youth. Every day\'s end\nthousands were go!ng east on that\ntrail, each to find his pot of gold at\nthe foot of the rainbow of memory.\nBefore they went to bed that night\nBrlmstead paid hls debt to Samson,\nwith interest, and very confidentially.\nIt was a long, wearisome ride hack\nto the land of plenty, over frozet\nground, with barely an Inch of sno*\nupon it, under a dark sky, with a ebJY\nly wind blowing.\n"After ail.
