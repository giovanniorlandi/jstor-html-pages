Seattle School\nDistrict No. 1\nJAMEL K. DONNOR\nThe College of William and Mary\nBackground: By a 5–4 margin, the U.S. Supreme Court in Parents Involved in Community\nSchools v. Seattle School District No. 1 declared that voluntary public school integration programs\nwere unconstitutional. Citing the prospective harm that students and their families\nmight incur from being denied admission to the high school of their choice, the Supreme\nCourt declared that the plaintiffs, Parents Involved in Community Schools (PICS), had a\nvalid claim of injury by asserting a interest in not being forced to compete for seats at certain\nhigh schools in a system that uses race as a deciding factor in many of its admissions\ndecisions.\nPurpose: The goal of the article is to discuss how conceptions of harm and fairness as articulated\nin Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 privilege\nthe self-interests of White students and families over the educational needs of students of\ncolor.\nResearch Design: This article is a document analysis.\nConclusions: By referencing the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision of 1954\n(Brown I) to buttress its decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has determined that programmatic\nefforts to ensure students of color access to quality learning environments are inher-\nently ominous. The dilemma moving forward for policy makers and scholars concerned with\nthe educational advancement of students of color is not to develop new ways to integrate\nAmerica’s public schools or reconcile the gaps in the Supreme Court’s logic, but rather to craft\nprograms and policies for students of color around the human development and workforce\nneeds of the global economy. \n', '736 Teachers College Record\nThe truth is that racial justice and colorblindness are not the\nsame thing.\n— Jerome McCristal Culp, 1994, p. 162\n. . . all white Americans, regardless of their political persuasions,\nare well aware of how black people have suffered due to\ninequities imposed upon them by white America . . . whites differ\nin how they handle that knowledge. \n—Andrew Hacker, 1992, p. 60\nWe won Brown. But almost nothing happened with schools.\n— Jack Greenberg, 2004, p. 67\nIn the narrowest of margins, the U.S. Supreme Court in Parents Involved\nin Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 decreed that voluntary\npublic school integration programs were unconstitutional. Citing the\nprospective harm that students and their families might incur from being\ndenied admission to the high school of their choice, the Supreme Court\ndetermined that the plaintiffs, Parents Involved in Community Schools\n(PICS), an organization comprised primarily of Whites in the Seattle\nmetropolitan area, had a “valid claim” to injury by asserting an “interest\nin not being ‘forced to compete for seats at certain high schools in a system\nthat uses race as a deciding factor in many of its admissions deci-\nsions” (Parents v. Seattle School District No. 1, 2007).\nSince the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, arguments\nasserting the harm and the unfairness of policy that consider race in student\nadmission decisions have been successful in framing the foregoing\npolicy as unjust and burdensome (Brown et al., 2003; Flagg, 1998;\nWinant, 1997a, 1997b). These interconnected arguments have been successful\nfor two reasons. First, policies that use race as a categorical vari-\nable or a factor among many (i.e., a plus-one factor) in student admission\ndecisions have been deemed a “special consideration above and beyond\na perceived baseline of equal treatment” (Bracey, 2006, p. 1241). Second,\nand most important, White students are often portrayed as being acutely\nharmed by education policies that consider race (T. H. Anderson, 2004;\nBonilla-Silva, 2003; Bracey; Ross, 1990). Consider for example, that much\nof the mainstream media’s coverage on this topic has focused on identifying\nsupposedly qualified White students or applicants who were not\nadmitted to the school or university of their choice because a less qualified\nperson of color had been granted admission (T. H. Anderson, 2004;\nGuinier & Sturm, 2001). \nAlong with framing programs, beyond the purview of fairness,\n', 'Beyond Brown 737\n concerns about the impact of such policy on White people overlook the\nstructural arrangements responsible for creating inequities in the first\nplace (Katz, Stern, & Fader, 2005). In addition, the aforementioned concerns\nignore the all-encompassing nature of inequality specific to educa-\ntion (Ladson-Billings, 2006). For example, the Black-White achievement\ngap is often understood as a contemporary phenomenon to be measured\nannually, rather than as the product of “historical, economic, sociopolitical,\nand moral decisions” that have shaped American society (Ladson-\nBillings, p. 5).\nSo, rather than explicitly argue against the Seattle School District’s\nattempts to provide students of color with an opportunity to attend one\nof the city’s top public high schools through its voluntary integration program,\nPICS used a notion of harm that framed the purported injury to\nWhite people and lack of fairness as equivalent to the historical mistreatment\nand contemporary marginalization of people of color (Freeman,\n1978). Although issues of harm and fairness are not new topics of policy\ndebates regarding the American education system, what is noteworthy in\nthis instance is the success of both constructs when used by Whites to curtail,\nif not thwart, policies and practices intended to promote racial jus-\ntice (Pollack, 2008; Taylor, 2000).\nThe purpose of this article is to discuss how PICS’ conception of harm\nand fairness, as articulated its petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, privileges\nthe self-interests of White students and families over the educational\nneeds of students of color. The goal of this article is twofold. The first is\nto explain how anti–school desegregation arguments are conceptualized.\nThe second goal of this article is to highlight the limitations of universalistic\npolicy solutions in accordance with the 1954 Brown v. Board of\nEducation decision to address race specific problems. This article is comprised\nof three sections. The first section reviews PICS’ argument against\nSeattle School District No. 1’s integration policy. The second section analyzes\nPICS’ arguments using legal scholar Alan Freeman’s perpetrator\nperspective framework of racial discrimination to highlight its limitations\nand inconsistencies (Freeman, 1978, 1990). The third section of this\n article offers an approach for rethinking policy solutions for addressing\nracial disparities in education in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling.\nPARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS’ ARGUMENT\nAGAINST SEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1’S VOLUNTARY \nINTEGRATION PROGRAM\nIn its petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, PICS contended that Seattle\nSchool District No. 1’s voluntary integration program created an\n', "738 Teachers College Record\n excessive burden for White families (Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-908, 2005).\nThe following is a synopsis of PICS’ arguments presented in its petition\nto the Supreme Court. \nARGUMENT I: RACIAL CLASSIFICATIONS ARE PRESUMPTIVELY\nINVALID AND MUST BE SUBJECTED TO THE STRICTEST JUDICIAL\nSCRUTINY\nIn this argument, PICS asserted that Seattle School District No. 1’s voluntary\nintegration program is a “racial quota” (Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-\n908, 2005, p. 21). Used by conservative ideologues on the far right of\nAmerican political continuum, the term racial quota is used to define\nsocial reform policies developed to ameliorate the legacy of Jim Crow  as\nunfair. With respect to education, te term racial quota alleges that people\nof color are given preferential treatment over Whites in school admission\ndecisions because of race (T. H. Anderson, 2004; Brown et al., 2003).\nDespite scant empirical evidence to support this viewpoint, the rhetoric\nof Whites disadvantaged creates the cognitive image necessary to mobilize\nmainstream resistance to policies and practices intended to promote\nracial equality (Winant, 1997a, 1997b). As such, PICS posited that the\nSeattle School District’s efforts to integrate its high schools “must be subject[ed]\nto the strictest judicial scrutiny” (Petitioner’s brief, p. 24). \nThe standard of judicial review by the Supreme Court, strict scrutiny is\nused to evaluate a state agency’s use of race as a criterion in determining\naccess to public opportunities and resources. More specifically, strict\nscrutiny is a two-part “ends-means test” that the high court uses to strike\ndown laws and policies that deny individuals or groups equal treatment\nbecause the explicit use of race violates their fundamental personal interest\n(Brooks, 2004). In order to meet this standard of judicial review, a\ngovernment agency must identify a broad societal goal or demonstrate a\n“compelling interest” to justify its use of race in policy and practice. In\naddition, a government agency must ensure that the methods used to\nachieve the compelling interest are specifically tailored to the societal\npurpose (City of Richmond v. Croson, 1989). As it pertains to education, the\nSupreme Court only allows an agency to consider race to remediate the\neffects of past racial discrimination and promote diversity in graduate\neducation (Donahue, 1997; see Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003; Lechner, 2003).\nBased on this understanding, PICS contended that the Seattle school\n district's voluntary integration program was unconstitutional because it\nhad never been under federal court desegregation orders, and the mission\nof secondary education is distinct from higher education. \n", "Beyond Brown 739\nARGUMENT II: THE DISTRICT’S PLAN USES RACIAL BALANCING\nAND THEREBY VIOLATES OUR COLOR-BLIND CONSTITUTION\nArgument II consists of seven interrelated sub-arguments contesting the\nfairness of Seattle School District No. 1’s voluntary integration program.\nThe first sub-argument, Except to remedy past discrimination racial balancing\nis unconstitutional, contended that the district’s desegregation policy\n“offends the Constitution . . . both from the express words of the document\nand from its philosophical and historical underpinnings in the\nDeclaration of Independence” (Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-908, 2005, p.\n26). In theory, the U.S. Constitution is a race-neutral document. In practice,\nhowever, the Constitution, from its inception, has been a “hostage of\nforces inimical to the interests of racial minorities” (Lively, 1989, p. 294).\nFor example, although slavery ran counter to the tenets of the U.S.\nConstitution, in practice, the founding fathers’ preoccupation with incorporating\nthe former colonies into a functioning political and economic\nsystem took precedent over racial equality (Lively, 1989). Despite this\ninconsistency, PICS contended that the Seattle school district's integration\nprogram violates the Constitution’s color-blind principle by requir-\ning public school officials to know the race of students (Petitioner’s brief,\nNo. 05-908). \nThe second sub-argument, the Essence of racial balancing is a mechanical\nuse of a quantitative criterion based on race, claimed that the Seattle School\nDistrict’s desegregation program was invalid because students were\nviewed collectively in admission decisions, rather than individually\n(Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-908, 2005). Specifically, PICS argued that\nbecause of the integration policy, students in the district were not allowed\nto demonstrate their respective qualifications for admission to oversubscribed\nhigh schools. The third sub-argument, The district’s race preference\nis a clear case of racial balancing, questioned the legality of the integration\nprogram on the grounds that student admission to oversubscribed high\nschools was solely contingent on the basis of whether he or she was “white\nor nonwhite” (Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-908, p. 29). Similar to its premise\nin Argument I, PICS, in this sub-argument, claimed that the integration\npolicy reduced a student’s chances of attending school close to home.\nSubsequently, families, according to PICS, were at risk for incurring\nexcessive harm if students were not admitted to schools close to home.\nConversely, the fourth sub-argument, Racial balancing is not justified by a\ndesire to obtain the benefits of diversity, maintained that the “only kind \nof diversity affected” by the district’s desegregation program was\n“between whites and nonwhites” (Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-908, p. 30).\nMoreover, PICS posited that “even if . . . racial diversity were to have\n", '740 Teachers College Record\n educational benefits . . . the end does not justify the means” (Petitioner’s\nbrief, No. 05-908, p. 30). In other words, if a positive correlation exists\nbetween racial diversity and student performance, integration is not\nworth the cost.\nThe fifth sub-argument of Argument II, Racial balancing is not justified\nas a desegregation measure because Seattle high schools are not segregated, alleged\nthat Seattle public schools were incapable of becoming racially segregated\n(Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-908, 2005). Framing the causes of school\nsegregation as the product of purposeful acts meant to harm, PICS contended\nthat a two-tier public education system that overtly assigned stu-\ndents to specific schools because race was a required component of the\nvoluntary integration policy. \nThe sixth sub-argument, Racial balancing is not excused by the fact that\nevery child is entitled to obtain a high school education, asserted that high\nschool students are a social class protected from discrimination under\nthe 14th Amendment. Inferring that the integration program created a\n“substantial hardship” for families by limiting their choice of schools,\nPICS maintained that the only way for the Supreme Court to resolve the\nmatter was to protect a student’s preference for attending a high school\nclose to home. The final sub-argument of Argument II, Racial balancing is\nnot excused because it discriminates sometimes against one race and sometimes\nagainst another, maintained that the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection\nClause requires state agencies to treat all citizens identically (Petitioner’s\nbrief, No. 05-908, 2005). In PICS view, the school district’s attempt to\naddress the under-inclusion and exclusion of students of color from an\narea’s most popular high schools intrudes on a student’s individual right\nto choose. \nARGUMENT III: THE DISTRICT’S PLAN FAILS BOTH PRONGS OF\nSTRICT SCRUTINY\nBeginning with restating the integration program’s inability to meet the\nstrict scrutiny standard, PICS, again through multiple sub-arguments,\nargued that students of color were unfairly afforded an admissions preference\nthat was injurious to White students. In the first sub-argument\nunder this heading, The district cannot establish that its race preference serves\nany compelling government interest, PICS asserted that the Seattle school\nboard was unable to demonstrate that student diversity served a compelling\ninterest because diversity is conceptually “too amorphous” and its\nsocial benefits are “too uncertain” (Petitioner’s brief, No. 05-908, 2005, \np. 35). In addition, PICS asserted that the benefits of diversity are \n“outweighed by the cost [it] necessarily impose[s]” (Petitioner’s Brief,\n', 'Beyond Brown 741\nNo. 05-908, p. 35). The second sub-argument, Trivial changes in pigmentation\ndiversity at a few already diverse schools cannot be a compelling interest,\ninsisted that the district’s voluntary integration program “does nothing to\naddress the nonwhite [population] in two schools with the smallest white\npopulations, Rainier Beach (8% white) and Cleveland (10% white)”\n(Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p. 37). Appropriating the Seattle school\nboard’s rationale for establishing its desegregation program, PICS\nargued that schools with a large student-of-color population were\nignored by the district policy (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p. 37). As a\nresult, according to PICS, this policy gap on face value made public\nschool integration unconstitutional.  \nThe third sub-argument, Avoiding the effects of voluntary choices is not a\ncompelling governmental interest, also argued that the district’s efforts to offset\nthe impact of housing segregation on school composition was not a\ncompelling interest (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, 2005). As mentioned\nearlier, for a state agency to use race as a criterion in determining access\nto public resources, it must ensure that the methods used to achieve the\ncompelling interest are specifically tailored to remediate the effects of\npast racial discrimination. For PICS, the racial composition of a neighborhood\nis the result of an amalgamation of individual choices rather\nthan structural conditions. Meaning where one chooses to send his or\nher child for schooling is a private matter not to be interfered with by the\nschool district. The fourth sub-argument of Argument III, The district cannot\nshow that its plan is narrowly tailored, contended that the voluntary inte-\ngration policy failed the strict scrutiny test because racial diversity is an\nimprecise policy instrument for creating an inclusive learning environment.\nAccording to PICS, because Seattle’s high schools have a “40%\nwhite and 60% non-white” student population, the district is already\nracially diverse (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p. 40).  Therefore, an integration\nprogram is unnecessary (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908). In addi-\ntion, PICS argued that the voluntary integration program did not address\nthe racial imbalance of schools with the “smallest white populations,”\nwhich in this view is a double standard  (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p.\n40). The fifth sub-argument under this heading, The race preference causes\nundue harm, submitted that the integration policy “inflict[s] an injury that\noffends the Constitution” (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p. 45).\nAlthough they acknowledge that the school district did not have an obligation\nto provide students with the opportunity to select the high school\nof his or her choice, PICS insisted that the integration policy was harmful\nto students who were not permitted to attend their school of choice.\n', '742 Teachers College Record\nARGUMENT IV: THE DEFERENCE GRANTED BY THE AMERICAN\nJUDICIAL SYSTEM TO LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS IS INCOMPATIBLE\nWITH THE CONSTITUTION’S EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE\nIn its final argument to the U.S. Supreme Court, PICS asserted that the\nprevious lower federal district and state court rulings upholding the\nlegality of the Seattle school district’s voluntary integration policy were\nunfair (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, 2005). Referring to the autonomy\nafforded to public school administrators by the lower courts, PICS maintained\nthat the Seattle school board used a “relaxed standard ” to assign\nstudents of oversubscribed schools in order to promote student diversity.\nAccording to PICS, the district’s approach was “unwarranted” because\n“no comparable line of cases” or precedent existed justifying its practice\n(Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p. 48). Citing the Brown v. Board of\nEducation decision of 1954 (Brown I), PICS argued that lower federal and\nstate courts’ deference to the district did not require that the “weakest\nand most racially imbalanced schools” be improved, further suggesting a\npolicy discrepancy (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p. 49).\nSUMMARY OF PICS’ ARGUMENT AGAINST \nSCHOOL DESEGREGATION\nDespite the intentions of Seattle School District No. 1’s integration program\nto ameliorate the effects of de facto residential segregation and pro-\nvide area school-age children with the educational benefits of attending\na diverse learning environment, PICS contended that the school board’s\nuse of race as a plus-one factor in assigning pupils to the most popular\nhigh schools created a burden for families that was harmful (Petitioner’s\nBrief, No. 05-908, 2005). In addition, the petitioning group contended\nthat the district’s desire to create a racially inclusive learning environment\nwas a racial quota because it “prefer[red] one individual to another\nfor no reason other than race” (Petitioner’s Brief, No. 05-908, p. 21). As\nsuch, the voluntary efforts to integrate area high schools did not meet\nthe Supreme Court’s strict scrutiny standard because the city of Seattle\nhad never operated a de jure segregated school system or been subjected\nto court-ordered desegregation. More importantly, the Seattle School\nDistrict’s efforts to provide students of color access to the city’s top high\nschools presented a heavy burden on White families with children not\nadmitted to the school of their choice. \n', 'Beyond Brown 743\nTHE NEW VICTIM AND THE NEW PERPETRATOR OF RACISM \nIN THE POST–CIVIL RIGHTS ERA\nAt first glance, PICS’ arguments for protecting a student’s choice of\nschools appears altruistic. A closer look, however, reveals that their assertion\nthat Seattle School District No. 1’s voluntary integration policy is\nharmful and discriminates against White people is fraught with inconsistencies\nand contradictions. Beginning with Argument I and Argument\nIII, which respectively question the validity of Seattle School District No.\n1’s voluntary integration, PICS calls on the Supreme Court to use a standard\nof judicial review that had not existed prior to 1978 (Brooks, 2004). \nFirst used by the U.S. Supreme Court in Regents University of California\nat Davis v. Bakke, strict scrutiny was developed as a methodology to analyze\nthe constitutionality of the university’s special admissions program to\ndiversify its medical school’s student body. The defendant, Allan Bakke,\na White male, sued the university, alleging that its diversity program had\ninjured him by preventing him from competing for all 100 slots in the\nmedical school’s incoming class in 1973 and 1974 (University of California\nRegents v. Bakke, 1978). Interestingly, Bakke had been denied admission\nto the University of California at Davis’s Medical School for two consecutive\nyears. Despite being “nowhere to be found in the Constitution or in\nits legislative history,” the Supreme Court used the strict scrutiny standard\nto determine that the medical school’s diversity program, which\nallotted 16 placements in a class of 100 for students of various racial and\nethnic backgrounds, was unconstitutional (Brooks, 2004, p. 175;\nUniversity of California Regents v. Bakke). \nAlong with the absence of a strict scrutiny precedent, the high court’s\nruling was problematic for three additional reasons. First, while Mr.\nBakke did have a “3.45 grade point and scored better than average” on\nthe Medical College Admissions Test, his 1973 application for admission\nwas submitted after the university’s deadline. Hence, the remaining 84\nslots were already likely filled (T. H. Anderson, 2004). Second, along with\nreceiving a low rating from his faculty interviewer at UC-Davis’s medical\nschool, Mr. Bakke was rejected by “all eleven medical schools” he applied\nto in 1974 (T. H. Anderson, 2004, p. 152; University of California Regents v.\nBakke, 1978). Third, and most troubling, neither Mr. Bakke nor his\nlawyers challenged the medical school’s other special admissions program,\nwhich reserved five admissions slots in each incoming class for the\nchildren of wealthy financial donors or “important state politicians” (T.\nH. Anderson, 2004, p. 152; Lipsitz, 1998). \n', '744 Teachers College Record\nIn thinking about the strict scrutiny standard more critically, one\nshould conclude that the Supreme Court’s evaluation of the harmfulness\nof the UC-Davis’s medical school diversity policy had little to do with\nadministering justice and more to do with who purported to be injured.\nBy failing to consider Bakke’s late application, poor interview, numerous\nrejections, and the medical school’s admission policy for applicants from\naffluent backgrounds, the U.S. Supreme Court selected to reach its\nprecedent-setting decision by exaggerating Mr. Bakke’s injury claim and\nby employing an unstated edict regarding the convergence of race, class,\nand social policy in America: (1) programs intended to foster racial\nequality regardless of impact will be determined unconstitutional, \n(2) Whites will overwhelmingly be identified as the victims of racial diversity,\nand (3) policies and practices that further the sociopolitical fortunes\nof society’s elite are beyond the purview of strict scrutiny (Bell, 2004).\nFROM PERPETRATOR TO COLOR-BLIND\nSince University of California Regents v. Bakke (1978), almost “all the winning\nplaintiffs” in racial equal protection lawsuits in education have been\nWhite (Kairys, 2004, p. 675). By appropriating the language and discourse\nof the civil rights movement, Whites have magically reinvented\nthemselves into the victims of federal and state legislation from this era\nby invoking what legal scholar Alan Freeman called a “perpetrator perspective”\nof racism and racial discrimination (Freeman, 1978, p. 1053;\nHarding, 1991). In contrast to a more critical conception of race, racism,\nand racial discrimination, which requires an examination of the “objective\nconditions of life-lack of jobs, lack of money, lack of housing—and\nthe consciousness associated with those objective conditions,” the perpetrator\nperspective views racism and racial discrimination as products of\nspecific actions carried out by an individual or institution (Freeman,\n1978, p. 1053). \nCentral to the perpetrator thesis is the “principle of individual or institutional\nfault” (Freeman, 1990, p. 1412). The notion of fault, according\nto Freeman (1978), “gives rise to a complacency about one’s own moral\nstatus; it creates a class of ‘innocents,’ who need not feel any personal\nresponsibility for the conditions associated with discrimination” (p.\n1055). Moreover, the perpetrator perspective glosses over historical racial\ninequity because it “presupposes a world composed of atomistic individuals\nwhose actions are outside of and apart from the social fabric and\nwithout historical continuity” (Freeman, 1978, p. 1054). The result of this\nviewpoint is that everyone has a racial identity that is equal in legal and\n', 'Beyond Brown 745\nhistorical significance. Therefore, everyone, especially Whites, has equal\nclaim to protection against discrimination (Freeman, 1990). In other\nwords, the United States is transformed from an imperial power\npremised on sustaining White supremacy and racial oppression into a\nnation of aggrieved minorities (Lopez, 2007; Mills, 1997; Winant, 2001;\nYoung, 1990). Ergo, unless a particular instance of racial discrimination\nor racism can be directly linked to a specific or ongoing intentional act\nperpetrated by an individual or institution, attempts to promote racial\njustice are viewed as racial discrimination in reverse (Black, 2002;\nFreeman, 1978; Lawrence, 1976; McCristal Culp, 1994). It is this cognitive\ndisconnect, coupled with the acontextualization of the interplay\namong race, opportunity, and the allocation of society’s resources, that\nleads a majority of Anglo Americans to argue for the application of colorblind\nand race-neutral approaches in pupil placement assignments and\nschool admissions policies (Lively, 1989; Lopez, 2006a, 2006b, 2007; powell,\n1994, 1997, 2000).\nDESEGREGATION AND ITS RESISTERS \nGiven strict scrutiny’s precarious intellectual foundation and the perpetrator\nperspective’s ahistorical conceptualization of race and racial injus-\ntice, PICS’ overall opposition toward Seattle School District No. 1’s\nvoluntary desegregation program should be viewed not as a matter of\nprinciple or equity, but rather part of a broader response to blunt the\noriginal intent of Brown (Bell, 1975, 2004). Initially, the architects of the\nBrown v. Board of Education lawsuit of 1954 envisioned that integrated public\nschools would begin to “facilitate the cherished American dream of\nequal opportunity . . . [and] . . . lead to some larger betterment of conditions\nfor black people” (Patterson, 2001, p. xvii). However, almost\nimmediately after the Brown I decision, southern Whites responded by\nengaging in acts of violence toward African Americans, as well as more\nsubtle methods of resistance, such as insisting on using freedom-ofchoice\nplans to desegregate public schools (Guthrie & Springer, 2004;\nPatterson, 2001). In theory, freedom-of-choice plans were meant to allow\nBlack and White parents equal opportunity to send their children to the\nschool of their choice (Crespino, 2006; Ogletree, 2004). In practice, however,\nfreedom-of-choice plans shifted the responsibility of public school\nintegration onto African Americans, because Blacks had to apply for\nadmission to White schools, and White parents “almost never” chose to\nenroll their children at African American schools (Kotlowski, 2005, \np. 172). Thus, the pace of school desegregation was not only slow, but for\n', '746 Teachers College Record\nalmost a decade after Brown v. Board of Education 1954 and Brown v. Board\nof Education 1955, “not a single black child attended an integrated public\ngrade school” in South Carolina, Alabama, or Mississippi (Klarman,\n1994, p. 84).\nAs such, I contend that PICS’ arguments for ensuring a student’s/family’s\nchoice is part and parcel a reaction by Whites to the perceived loss\nin their absolute right to exclude non-Whites from meaningful learning\nopportunities (Bell, 1988, 1999, 2001; Harris, 1995; Patterson, 2001;\nPayne, 2004). For example, PICS’ fifth subcontention under Argument\nIII, which posited that the Seattle school district’s voluntary integration\nprogram caused undue harm and was injurious because it limited student\nand parental choice of school, is misleading. Consider that during\nthe 2000–2001 academic year, the only year in which the integration\n policy was used, “80.3%” of the total number of ninth graders were\nassigned their first choice of school (Brief for Respondents, No. 05-908,\n2005, p. 9). Putting the foregoing figure in a broader context, without\nthe integration policy, the percentage of ninth graders receiving their\nfirst choice of schools would have increased by “only a tenth of a percentage\npoint, to 80.4%” (Brief for Respondents, No. 05-908, p. 9). In\nessence, the Seattle School District’s voluntary integration plan did not\ninterfere with a student’s choice of preferred school (Brief for\nRespondents, No. 05-908, p. 9). Further, if a disaffected family demonstrated\nthat the school district misapplied the integration policy or that\ntheir child suffered a “psychological hardship” or “medical need” that\nprecluded him or her from attending a nonneighborhood high school,\nthe pupil placement assignment could be overridden (Brief for\nRespondents, No. 05-908, p. 7). In essence, PICS, like Allan Bakke and\nthe Supreme Court in University of California Regents v. Bakke (1978), overstated\nthe impact  of education programs designed to increase the access\nof students of color to quality schools on Whites.\nInterestingly, PICS’ arguments for the abolishment of Seattle School\nDistrict No. 1’s voluntary integration program are not new, but rather,\nparallel to those advanced by opponents of desegregation in the region\nduring the 1970s (Brief for Respondents, No. 05-908, 2005). For example,\nin State ex rel. Citizens Against Mandatory Bussing v. Brooks (1972), the\nplaintiffs, also a parent organization, sought to recall all seven members\nof the Seattle school board by alleging that the adoption of a desegregation\npolicy was “malfeasance, misfeasance, and violated their oath of\noffice.” Similarly, in Citizens Against Mandatory Bussing v. Palmason (1972),\na parent group claimed that Seattle School District No. 1’s busing plan\nwas detrimental to students and interfered with a parent’s right to determine\nhis or her child’s education.\n', 'Beyond Brown 747\nWhile the Washington State Supreme Court in State ex rel. Citizens\nAgainst Mandatory Bussing v. Brooks (1972) acknowledged that employing\na school administrator known to be incompetent and imposing racial\ndesegregation were sufficient grounds for a recall, the state justices’ ruling\nin favor of the board members declared that desegregation and bus-\ning were within the scope of their authority. In addition, the State\nSupreme Court held that the petitioners’ assertion that federal judicial\nprecedents in de jure school segregation cases were inapplicable to de facto\ncases was invalid. According to the judges in this case, the causes for segregation\nin Seattle public schools de facto or de jure were “of no conse-\nquence” (State ex rel. Citizens Against Mandatory Bussing v. Brooks).\nSimilarly, in Citizens Against Mandatory Bussing v. Palmason (1972), the\nWashington State Supreme Court justices decreed that district administrators\nunder the state’s constitution had the authority to implement a\nbusing program. Further, the court rejected the petitioners’ assertion of\nthe right to send a child to his or her neighborhood school, declaring\nthat it was “inconsistent” with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (1971). For the judges in\nPalmason, \nno one can have a vested right in any general rule or policy of\nlegislation which entitles him to  insist that it remain unchanged\nfor his benefit . . .[w]e find no authority in law for the proposition\nthat parents have a vested right to send their children to, or\nthat children have a vested right to attend, any particular public\nschool. \nPerhaps it is possible that the Washington State Supreme Court judges\nin Brooks and Palmason, respectively, recognized that school segregation,\nlike residential segregation, is created by a confluence of macro-level\npolitical, economic, and social dynamics (e.g., mortgage eligibility) and\nmicro-level processes, such as racial attitudes and preferences (Briggs,\n2005a, 2005b; Charles, 2005; Dreier, Mollenkopf, & Swanstrom, 2005;\nOrfield, 2002; Rury & Mirel, 1997). In addition, it is highly likely that the\ncourt understands that a family’s “choice” of school, like housing, is\ninformed by an interplay of public and private forces, some which are\ninformed by race. For instance, Charles’ (2005) multicity study on urban\ninequality and neighborhood composition revealed that most White\nhomeowners and prospective homebuyers preferred to reside in a predominately\nor all-White neighborhood. Conversely, non-Whites, such as\nAfrican Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino/a Americans, although\n cognizant of their “subordinate position” and the negative stereotypes\n', '748 Teachers College Record\nassigned to them by Whites, were more willing to live in a racially\n integrated community (Charles, 2005, p. 73). According to Charles\n(2005), “for all minority groups, economic and social advancement is\nassociated with greater proximity and similarity to white Americans. For\nwhites . . . integration with any group—but especially with blacks—brings\nthe threat of loss of relative status” (p. 67). Also, Orfield’s (2002) analysis\nof racial data for elementary school students in the 25 largest U.S.\nregions shows that once the minority share in a community’s schools\nincreases to a threshold level of approximately 10%–20%, the community’s\nracial transition accelerates until the minority percentages eventu-\nally reach 80% or greater. In short, the student composition of public\nschools eventually mirrors housing patterns (Kane, Staiger, & Reigg,\n2005). Hence, Whites have a “possessive investment” in their aversion to\npeople of color (Lipsitz, 1998).\nIn addition to higher property values, the “geography of opportunity”\nassociated with predominantly White neighborhoods (i.e., education\nquality, employment options, safety, and environmental health) is more\nmeaningful and expansive than in communities that are overwhelmingly\nnon-White (Briggs, 2005a, 2005b; powell, 1997; Tate, 2008). Much of the\nliterature on school quality and neighborhood capacity indicates that\nrace and class are not only proxies for school failure, but also determinants\nfor how likely one is to reside in an environmentally toxic neigh-\nborhood (Briggs, 2005a, 2005b; powell, 1997). Like the Southern\nsegregationists and Northern resisters to busing who feared that Brown\nwould bring an end to Whites’ political and economic dominance over\nAfrican Americans and usher in an era of unfettered competition for\nsocial opportunities and resources, arguments opposing school integration\nare rhetorical devices used by Whites to protect their sociopolitical\nprivilege and relative socioeconomic advantage without appearing to be\nracist (Bonilla-Silva, 2003; Guinier, 2004; Klarman, 1994; Lipsitz, 1998;\nPatterson, 2001). \nIn the 21st century, White Americans advance and maintain their racial\ninterests by invoking coded terms such as choice, preference, rights, and colorblindness\nwhich prioritize individual liberty over racial justice (Roberts,\n1996; Young, 1990). Indeed, a similar process occurred when the\nConstitution’s signatories purposely omitted explicit racialized terms,\nsuch as Black, White, yet bestowed the privileges and rights of citizenship\nonly to individuals of European descent. Put simply, the absence of race\ndoes not preclude the implicit oppressive uses of race.\n', "Beyond Brown 749\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nIn this article, I have tried to explain how the notions of harm and injury\nput forth by the petitioners in Parents v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007),\nan anti–school desegregation case, exaggerates the impact of the district’s\nvoluntary integration policy on where a family can send their child\nfor high school. In addition, I have shown how that Parents Involved in\nCommunity Schools’ opposition to the Seattle School District’s desegregation\nprogram is part of a larger resistance by Whites to public school\nintegration, both locally and historically. In petitioning the U.S. Supreme\nCourt to protect a student’s right to attend the school of his or her\nchoice, PICS, like Southern segregationists and Northern resisters to busing,\nseek to maintain pupil placement assignments that are consistent\nwith de facto housing segregation patterns in the region (Brief for\nRespondents, No. 05-908, 2005). More importantly, PICS appears intent\non foreclosing students of color from attending the region’s better high\nschools.\nAccording to the Seattle school board, high schools located in North\nSeattle, which is predominantly White, are more sought after by students\nand their families than those in South Seattle, which is primarily nonWhite\n(Brief for Respondents, No. 05-908, 2005). Similarly, housing pat-\nterns in the Seattle region are divided along a North-South corridor, in\nwhich “more than 75% of the District’s non-white students live in the\nsouthern half of the city, while 67% of the white students live in the\nnorthern half” (Brief for Respondents, No. 05-908, p. 2). The products of\nthe city’s residential patterns have been “varying levels of racial segregation\nin Seattle schools” (Brief for Respondents, No. 05-908, p. 2). Thus,\nthe sole purpose of the voluntary integration program was to ameliorate\nthe effects of de facto residential segregation and provide area school-age\nchildren with the educational benefits of attending a diverse learning\nenvironment.\nParents v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007) reflects the limitations of\nBrown. Consider the high Court's heavy reliance on Brown I to justify its\nverdict. Writing on behalf of the Court’s majority, Chief Justice Roberts\nremarked,\nIn Brown v. Board of Education (Brown I), we held that segregation\ndeprived black children of equal educational opportunities\nregardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors\ndenoted inferiority. It was not the inequality of the facilities but\nthe fact of legally separating children on the basis of race on\nwhich the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954.\n", '750 Teachers College Record\n(Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1,\n05-908, p. 24)\nBy referencing Brown I to support the Court’s decision, Chief Justice\nRoberts and the concurring justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy\nhave deemed programmatic and policy attempts to ensure students of\ncolor access to quality learning inherently ominous.\nThe dilemma moving forward for policy makers and scholars concerned\nwith the educational advancement of students of color is not to\ndevelop new ways to integrate America’s public schools or reconcile the\ngaps in the Supreme Court’s logic in Parents v. Seattle School District No. 1\n(2007). Rather, educational programs and policies for students of color\nneed to be crafted around current and future human, information, and\ntechnological needs of the American political economy. Indeed, given\nthe social and political epoch in which it was conceived, Brown was a brilliant\nstrategy. Unfortunately, however, its architects underestimated the\nsustainability of Whites’ resistance. The convergence of Jim Crow, the\ncivil rights movement of the 1950s, and the Cold War with Russia served\nas the impetus and moral linchpin for national policy makers to symbolically\nreconcile a disconnect with the country’s global aspirations (Bell,\n1987, 1992, 1995, 2004; Dudziak, 1995). In the postindustrial era, education\npolicies guided by Brown no longer avail themselves to the human\ndevelopment and workforce needs of the global economy. \nEfforts to develop and sustain quality learning opportunities for students\nof color must be “built around the idea of furthering the well-being\nof the entire community” and aligned with the human capital development\nneeds regionally, nationally, and internationally (Stone, 2005, p.\n209). The challenge for scholars and policy makers concerned with communities\nof color is to advance a new course of sustained action for ensur-\ning that its children are not left further behind. The truth is, Brown, as it\nwas originally conceived in spirit and intent, no longer has any strategic\nvalue in the educational advancement of students of color in the United\nStates. In short, Brown is dead.  \nReferences\nAnderson, T. H. (2004). The pursuit of fairness: A history of affirmative action. Oxford, England:\nOxford University Press.\nAnderson, J. D. (2006).
