This is especially \ntrue for Xerults, which occur in areas under a Mediterranean \nclimate, with hot, dry summers and a xeric soil moisture \nregime, all of which pose a further problem: water stress in \nthe vegetation. In Xerults, acidity—and Al3+ saturation in the \nexchange complex as a result—increases with increasing soil \ndepth; this hinders root development in subsurface Bt horizons, \nwhich hold the main stocks of water for the summer period \n(Espejo, 1987; Peregrina et al., 2006).\nThis type of soil is highly abundant in raña formations \nfrom the middle Pliocene in western Spain, where it spans more \nthan 106 ha, and generally prevails in economically depressed \nareas. Rañas are detritic continental formations from the \nMiddle to Upper Pliocene with highly weathered soils, which \nretain many features typical of a subtropical pre-Quaternary \nclimate (viz. hot, wet summers, which have resulted in heavily \nweathered soils) (Suc, 1984; Espejo, 1987).\nUntil the 1940s, Xerults were minimally exploited for agricultural\npurposes in Spain (Espejo, 1987). In fact, they merely \nconstituted the support for Cistus ladanifer L., Halimium \nocymoides (Lam.) Willk, Chamaespartium tridentatum (L.) F. \nGibbs, and Arbutus unedo L. bushes coexisting with scattered \ncork oaks (Quercus suber L.). The increased availability of fertilizers\nand scarcity of food that followed the Spanish civil war of \n1936 to 1939 propitiated the clearance of the natural vegetation\nand the cultivation of raña surfaces. This rapidly reduced \nthe organic matter content of the Ap horizon and also soil \nquality as a result. Because of their low natural fertility, the \nsoils were used for extensive cropping of grasses (oat [Avena \nsativa L.] and rye [Secale cereale L.], mainly), which were cultivated\nunder a “crop and fallow” regime (i.e., 1 yr with the \ncrop and the next in fallow) to obtain supplementary fodder \nfor ovine cattle in the area. In recent years, however, many crop \nF. Peregrina\nI. Mariscal\nETSI Agrónomos\nUniversidad Politécnica\nCiudad Universitaria\n28040 Madrid\nSpain\nR. Ordóñez\nP.

An experimental farm \nwas established and the Ap horizon of the soil was amended with limestone (L), phosphogypsum\n(PG), or red gypsum (RG) to alleviate Al toxicity. The PG and RG were supplied \nat 8.0 and 8.8 Mg ha−1, respectively. In addition, the gypsum-amended plots received either \nCBS at 0.9 Mg ha−1 or limestone at 1.1 Mg ha−1. We studied the effects of the treatments on \nthe exchange complex, soil solution, and the biomass production of ‘Jabato’ wheat (Triticum \naestivum L.) under fi eld and greenhouse conditions. The CBS proved highly effective in \nreplenishing Mg lost from the soil through application of gypsum amendments. In the fi eld \nexperiment, only the RG + CBS treatment resulted in a statistically signifi cant increase of \nbiomass production relative to the control. In the greenhouse experiment, all treatments \nresulted in signifi cantly increased production relative to the control, the largest (26 times) \nby RG + CBS. The PG + CBS and RG + CBS treatments resulted in signifi cantly increased \nproduction relative to PG + L and RG + L, which testifi es to the favorable effect of the Mg \nsupplied by CBS. Also, the treatments including RG resulted in signifi cantly increased production\nwith respect to those including PG; the increased productivity is tentatively ascribed \nto a potential toxic effect of Al–F ion pairs, which were more abundant in the soil solution \nof PG-treated soil.\nAbbreviations: AAS, atomic absorption spectrophotometry; AES, atomic emission spectrophotometry; CBS, \nconverter basic slag; ECEC, effective cation exchange capacity; ICP–AES, inductively coupled plasma atomic \nemission spectroscopy; L, lime; PG, phosphogypsum; Pw, water-soluble phosphorus; RG, red gypsum.\nSO\nIL\n F\nER\nTI\nLI\nTY\n &\n P\nLA\nN\nT \nN\nU\nTR\nIT\nIO\nN\nPublished March, 2008\n', 'SSSAJ: Volume 72: Number 2  •  March –April 2008 403 \nfi elds have been abandoned owing to their gradual deterioration\nand low yields.\nRendering Ultisols suitable for agricultural purposes \n(particularly Xerults) entails supplying them with appropriate\namendments to correct excessive acidity and Al toxicity \n(Peregrina et al., 2006). The effects of liming on soil Ca and \nAl levels are initially confi ned to the zone of application, the \nAp horizon (Ritchey et al., 1980; Pavan et al., 1984). Because \nof their increased solubility, gypsum amendments applied to \nsoil surfaces are effective at supplying Ca and lowering Al contents\ndeep in the soil profi le (Sumner et al., 1986; Sumner and \nCarter, 1988; Sumner, 1995; Farina et al., 2000). The use of \ngypsum amendments, however, not only reduces the Al content\nof the exchange complex, but also causes substantial leach-\ning of exchangeable bases other than Ca, especially Mg (Reeve \nand Sumner, 1970; O’Brien and Sumner, 1988; Syed Omar \nand Sumner, 1991; Ritchey and Snuffer, 2002). Magnesium \nlosses result from the displacement of the element by Ca and \nits subsequent leaching; thus, Mg ions form uncharged ion \npairs with SO4\n2− ions that quickly rise through soils with \nminimal sorption (Bohn et al., 1979). Because this nutrient \nis initially present at low levels in this type of soil, the process \nleads to considerably imbalanced Ca/Mg ratios (Christenson \net al., 1973; Carran, 1991) that can severely impair soil productivity.\nIn a laboratory test, Peregrina et al. (2006) found the \napplication of gypsum at a rate of 7.5 Mg ha−1 to the Ap horizon\nof a Palexerult to reduce its Mg content below 2% of its \neffective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) after two leaching \ncycles. According to Adams and Henderson (1962) and Hailes \net al. (1997), such a low Mg saturation severely decreases soil \nproductivity. Therefore, gypsum-amended Ultisols require \nthe addition of some Mg to avoid too low available Mg levels \nand, ultimately, Mg defi ciency (Zaifnejad et al., 1996a, 1996b; \nRitchey et al., 1999; Ritchey and Snuffer, 2002). Dolomite- \nand magnesite-based amendments have traditionally been used \nas Mg sources, and so has MgO obtained by heating magnesite.\nThus, Ritchey and Snuffer (2002) used MgO obtained by \ncalcination of magnesite (MgCO3) to offset Mg losses caused \nby the application of gypsum to Hapludults in Virginia and \nfound that maintaining the Mg content of the exchange complex\nrequired using only half the amount of Mg when supplied \nas MgO than when applied as dolomite.\nUsing alternative soil amendments based on industrial \nbyproducts is especially important in areas where farmers have \na low purchasing power. Red gypsums are byproducts of the \nindustrial production of TiO2 from illmenite, and phosphogypsums\nare byproducts of the production of H3PO4 by treat-\ning phosphate rock with H2SO4. Both byproducts have a high \ngypsum content and are quite affordable and accessible to local \nfarmers to correct Al toxicity. Converter basic slag (CBS) is an \nindustrial byproduct with a high Mg content, but scarcely used \nfor agricultural purposes in Spain. Converter basic slag results \nfrom the demolition of the thermal insulators of converters \nused by the steel industry; the byproduct is rich in MgO and \nCaO, so it constitutes a highly effi cient amendment for soil \nacidity (González et al., 1993).\nThe main purposes of this work were to assess the agronomic\nfeasibility of using CBS as an affordable, readily acces-\nsible byproduct to offset Mg losses from gypsum-amended \nPalexerults in western Spain and to assess its effect on biomass \nproduction in a crop of ‘Jabato’ wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). \nThis cultivar was previously studied in this type of soil with a \nview to examining the effect of lime and gypsum amendments \nand correcting Al toxicity, and was found to be responsive to \nMg defi ciency in the soil (unpublished data, 2004).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSoil\nThe present study was conducted in the Cañamero “raña” surface \n(southwestern Spain). The predominant soils of the area are Plinthic \nand Humic Plinthic Palexerults, and have previously been studied \nwith regard to Al toxicity and its correction (Peregrina et al., 2006).\nTable 1 summarizes the properties of the studied soil profi le, \na clayey-skeletal, kaolinitic, acid, thermic Plinthic Palexerult (Soil \nSurvey Staff, 2003) or hyperdistric Acrisol (FAO, 1998), as determined\nby Peregrina et al. (2006). The soil was examined and sampled \nin the center of the test fi eld used. It has a low exchangeable base content\nthat decreases with increasing depth—and so does its pH, while \nits KCl-extractable Al content exhibits the opposite trend.\nThe mean annual precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration\n(Thornthwaite) in the Cañamero raña are 830 mm, 14.9°C, \nand 798 mm, respectively. The area goes through a period of severe \ndrought (May–September) and one of excessive soil moisture \n(November–April) each year.\nAmendments\nThe gypsum amendments used to suppress Al toxicity in the \nsoil were phosphogypsum (PG) and red gypsum (RG). In addition, \na highly pure limestone (Caliza Gines) was used as a reference liming\namendment. The CBS was supplied by Acerinox SA (Madrid) and \nobtained from a steel factory in southern Spain; the PG came from Fertiberia \nSA (Madrid) and the RG from Tioxide Europe SL (Huelva, Spain).\nTable 1.

All were subjected to acid digestion with HF and HClO4, \nand to alkaline fusion with Na2CO3 (Jackson, 1976). The resulting \nsolutions were analyzed for major, minor, and trace elements using \ninductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry \n(ICP–AES), atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), ion chromatography,\nselective electrodes (for F), and colorimetric methods. \nPhosphorus was determined according to Murphy and Riley (1962). \nThe relative richness in CaSO4 of the PG and RG was determined \naccording to Lagerwerff et al. (1965) by dissolving 0.5 g of the amendment\nin 1 L of distilled water and stirring at 25°C for 12 h—instead \nof 0.5 h—after which the supernatant was analyzed for Ca (AAS) and \nSO4\n2– (ion chromatography).\nTables 2 and 3 list the major and minor components, respectively, \nof the amendments. The data for PG and RG were previously reported \nby Peregrina et al. (2006). The PG was the amendment containing \nthe largest amount of gypsum; by virtue of its origin, F and P2O5 \nprevailed in it—and so did Fe2O3 and TiO2 in RG. The RG and PG \namendments contained 82.4 and 90.7%, respectively, of CaSO4·2H2O.\nField Test \nThe test fi eld, located in the Cañamero raña surface, consisted \nof a series of 6- by 7-m2 plots that were arranged in accordance with \na randomized block design with four replications. The fi eld spanned \nan area that was previously cropped with local cultivars of rye under a \n“crop and fallow” regime. The treatments used were as follows: control \n(C), limestone (L), RG + CBS, PG + CBS, RG + L, and PG \n+ L. The application rate for the L treatment was 4.6 Mg ha−1 \nof limestone, which suffi ced to raise the pH of the Ap horizon \nto 6.2 from its initial value (5.1). Such a rate supplied about \n1.7 Mg ha−1 of Ca and was calculated by incubating at fi eld \ncapacity and 25°C soil aliquots containing increasing amounts \nof pure CaCO3 (reagent) equivalent to 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.5, and \n10 Mg ha−1. The CaCO3 rate–fi nal pH curves allowed us to \ndetermine the lime rate needed to raise the pH to 6.2 according\nto Peregrina et al. (2006). The fi nal pH, 6.2, was chosen in \naccordance with Kamprath (1971) and Sánchez (1976); based \non their results with limed Ultisols from the southeastern \nUnited States, they recommended never exceeding pH 6.5 in \norder to not reduce the availability of other nutrients, including\nP. The addition of gypsum to the Ap horizon of our soils \ninitially caused a slight decrease in pH in water, which precluded\ncalculating the amount of gypsum required to raise it to \n6.2 (Peregrina et al., 2006). The plots treated with RG or PG \nreceived 8.8 or 8.0 Mg ha−1 of RG or PG, respectively, which \nsupplied 1.7 Mg ha−1 of Ca (the same amount as 4.6 Mg ha−1 \nof L). Together with PG or RG, the soil received 0.9 Mg ha−1 \nof CBS to replenish Mg lost from the exchange complex following \nthe application of the gypsum; such an application rate was calculated \nunder the assumption that, following the application of the gypsum \namendment, up to 90% of Mg on the exchange complex of the Ap \nand AB horizons would be lost and doubling the result, as proposed \nby Peregrina et al. (2006).\nThe plots treated with PG + L and RG + L received the same \namount of PG or RG as the previous ones; because CBS supplied \nadditional Ca and increased soil pH (González et al., 1993), such \nplots received the amount of L (1.1 Mg ha−1) needed to raise the pH \nof the Ap horizon to the same extent as 0.9 Mg ha−1 of CBS.\nPlots were prepared and amendments applied in October 2000. \nThe amendments were surface applied and incorporated into the Ap \nhorizon by using a harrow pass with a two-wheel tractor. In October \n2001, the Ap horizon in each plot was sampled to a depth of 0.2 m at \nthree points lying at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of 1-m side \nlength located in the center of the plot. Then each plot was supplied \nwith an N–P–K fertilizer consisting of 70 kg ha−1 of N, 70 kg ha−1 \nof P, and 70 kg ha−1 of K that were obtained from Ca-free sources \n(viz. KCl, NH4NO3, and NH4H2PO4, respectively). Fertilizers were \napplied to the soil surface and incorporated into the Ap horizon by \nharrowing with a two-wheel tractor. The plots were sown with Jabato \nwheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at a rate of 175 kg ha−1 on 5 Nov. 2001; \nseeds were spread on the surface and then tilled with a pass of a fi eld \ncultivator. The plots were supplied with an additional 70 kg ha−1 of N \nin the spring. Productivity in each plot was assessed after ear maturation\non 16 June 2002 by harvesting the plant material contained \nin two 1-m2 squares; plants were cut 2 cm above ground level. For \nthe period 1963 to 1996, the average of the highest and lowest \ntemperatures in January (the coldest month November–June) were \n10.6 and 3.4°C, respectively, and those of June (the hottest month), \n28.1 and 14.5°C, respectively.\nBecause the soil was too dry after plants were harvested, \nwe postponed further sampling until the fi rst rain event, in \nSeptember—the summer in southwestern Spain is very dry—to \nfacilitate use of the drill. On 26 Sept. 2002, the four plots per treatment\nwere sampled similarly as in 2001, using a drill 0.1 m in diam-\nTable 2.

This can \naffect crop growth and development. In order to obtain reliable productivity\ndata, we conducted a greenhouse study. In autumn 2001, \nafter the fertilizer application, the 0.2-m upper layer of soil (Ap horizon)\nwas collected from each plot by using a cylindrical drill 0.1 m \nin diameter. Each plot was sampled at three different points (viz. at \nthe center and at two points 1 m on each side in the direction of the \nlargest plot). The three samples thus obtained were mixed, homogenized,\nand allowed to air dry before a 1.5-kg portion was selected for \nplacement in a 1.5-L pot 0.12 m in diameter that was previously fi lled \nwith a 0.03-m-thick layer of coarse quartz sand intended to facilitate \ndrainage. Each pot was equipped with a soil moisture sampler (Rhizon \nSMS-10 cm, Eijkelkamp Agricsearch, Giesbeek, the Netherlands) that \nwas placed at a 45° angle from horizontal. The Rhizon SMS consisted\nof a 0.1-m-long hydrophilic porous polymer sheath (2.5-mm \no.d., 1.5-mm i.d., average pore diameter ?0.1 µm) fi tted around a \nstainless steel wire and connected to polyvinyl chloride tubing with a \nneedle at the other end. This allowed an integral soil water sample to \nbe collected from the 0.01- to 0.10-m depth. The soil in each pot was \nplaced as three successive layers of 0.5 kg each, pressed by hand until \nthey reached the same height in each pot so that all pots were fi lled \nto the same height and volume of soil. The bulk density of the soil \nin each pot was 1.48 Mg m–3; such a high value was a result of the \nAp horizon containing 24.6% weathered quartzitic “gravel” less than \n2 cm in diameter and possessing a red core and a black cortex rich in \nhematite and maghemite (Peregrina et al., 2006).\nAfter the soil was taken to fi eld capacity (0.21 kg water kg–1 soil), \neach pot was planted with three seeds from the same wheat cultivar \n(Jabato) used in the test fi eld. Once sown, the 24 pots were placed in \na randomized complete block design on a greenhouse bench, where \nseedling growth was monitored from November to May. The greenhouse\nwas kept unheated through the growing cycle to ensure that \nthe prevailing temperature would be close to that in the fi eld, where \nthe wheat crop is typically sown in November and harvested in June. \nThe average of the highest and lowest temperatures in the coldest \nmonth of this period (January) were 12.8 and 6.1°C, and those of \nthe hottest month (May) were 29.2 and 16.1°C. During the 24 wk of \nthe greenhouse test, the pots were supplied with 150 cm3 of distilled \nwater on a weekly basis; each water addition was done gradually to \navoid the formation of free water on the pot surfaces. Such additions \nmade the volume to 3.6 L, which, based on the sampled soil surface \narea (80 cm2), was equivalent to the approximately 450 mm by which \nprecipitation exceeded evapotranspiration in the months where the \nformer was greater than the latter (October–April). After half the volume\n(1.8 L) was added (viz. 12 wk after seeding), and 2 d after the last \n0.15 L of distilled water was supplied, the soil solution was extracted \nby sticking the needles from the Rhizon SMS into vacuumed bottles, \nand an aliquot of ?0.02 L was used for analysis.\nAfter the test, the plants were cut 0.01 m above soil level and \ndried to a constant weight at 60°C to determine the total dry matter \nweight of each plant and to measure ear and stem lengths, ears being \nweighed separately. Following drying, the soil contained in each pot \nwas saved for analysis of the exchange complex.\nAnalytical Methods for Soil\nSoil Samples\nBoth the soil samples used to describe the profi le and those collected\nfrom the test fi eld and the pots were subjected to the same \nanalyses. They were air dried and sifted through 2-mm mesh. The \nsoil pH was determined in water and in 0.01 mol L−1 CaCl2 (using a \nsoil/solution ratio of 1:2.5). The electrical conductivity in water was \nalso determined at a soil/solution ratio of 1:2.5. Exchange bases were \nextracted with 1 mol L−1 NH4OAc at a soil/solution ratio of 1:10 \n(Thomas, 1982), the extracts being used to quantify Ca and Mg by \nfl ame AAS, and Na and K by fl ame AES. The amounts of Ca, Mg, \nNa, and K extracted in water at a soil/solution ratio of 1:10 were subtracted\nfrom the previously measured amounts of exchangeable bases. \nAluminum was extracted with a 1 mol L−1 KCl solution (Barnhisel \nand Bertsch, 1982) and determined by titration with NaF (Yuan, \n1959). The water-extractable P contents were determined by using the \nmethod of Sissingh (1971), except that the fi nal soil/water ratio used \nwas 1:5 instead of 1:22, and the Bray-1 extractable P (Bray and Kurtz, \n1945) was also determined. Phosphorus in the resulting extracts was \nmeasured colorimetrically according to Murphy and Riley (1962).\nSoil Solutions\nThe soil solutions were analyzed for Ca, Mg, K, Na, Al, Si, Zn, and \nMn by ICP–AES and AAS, SO4\n2– by capillary electrophoresis, NO3\n– and \nCl– with ion-selective electrodes, F– also with an ion-selective electrode \n(using a TISAB solution to previously destroy F complexes), and P by \nusing the colorimetric method of Murphy and Riley (1962).\nThe activity of the major ionic species of Al present in the \nsoil solution was determined by using the software MINTEQA2/\nPRODEFA2 (Allison et al., 1991), using the concentrations of Ca, \nMg, K, Na, Al, Si, Zn, Mn, SO4\n2–, NO3\n–, Cl–, and F– in the soil \nsolution extracted from each pot as inputs.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nComposition of the Converter Basic Slag\nThe major components of CBS are Mg and Ca, followed \nby Fe (Table 2). Chromium is its principal trace element by \nvirtue of its being used to manufacture special steels. The heavy \nmetal content of this byproduct, however, poses no environmental\nhazard at the rates at which it is usually applied to soil, \nwhich are well below the limit established by the European \nCouncil (1986) for sewage sludge.\nEffect of Amendments on the Soil Exchange \nComplex and Phosphorus Availability\nAp Horizon in Plots\nOne year after the amendments were applied, there were \nno signifi cant differences with respect to the control as regards \npH in soil/water suspensions in the Ap horizon, except that the \nL-treated samples had an increased pH (6.4) (Table 4). On the \nother hand, the pH in CaCl2 was signifi cantly increased with \nrespect to the control for all treatments; this is consistent with \nthe Al content on the exchange complex, which was always \nsignifi cantly lower than in the controls as a result of Al being \ndisplaced by Ca. Two years after application, all gypsum treatments\nhad caused a small—but signifi cant—increase in pH \nwith respect to the control; the increase was especially marked \nin the L-treated plots, which exhibited signifi cant differences \nfrom the gypsum-treated plots. The pH in CaCl2 changed \n', '406 SSSAJ: Volume 72: Number 2  •  March–April 2008\nsimilarly as in the previous year; this is consistent with a gradual\ndecrease in the amount of Al present in the Ap horizon of \nthe amended plots.\nOne year after the soil was amended, all treatments had signifi\ncantly increased the exchangeable Ca contents by the replace-\nment of effect H+ by Ca2+ on the exchange complex; the differences\nbetween treatments persisted after 2 yr (Table 4).\nThe initial Mg content of the soil was very low: \n0.22 cmolc kg\n−1, and also a low percentage of the ECEC was \nsaturated by Mg (8.8%) (Table 4). Hailes et al. (1997) studied\nUdults and other types of acid soils in northeastern Australia \nand found exchangeable Mg contents of 0.21 cmolc kg\n−1 and an \nECEC saturation by Mg of 7% as the threshold level for a favorable \nresponse of maize (Zea mays L.) to the addition of Mg to the soil.\nOne year after our amendments were applied to the plots \ntreated with PG + CBS or RG + CBS, the exchangeable Mg \ncontents were signifi cantly higher than those of the controls \nor the plots that were supplied with the other amendments \n(Table 4). After 2 yr, the gypsum treatments containing CBS \ncontinued to signifi cantly increase Mg contents with respect \nto the L-based treatments; the differences with respect to the \ncontrol were only signifi cant with the PG + CBS treatment, \nhowever. The increased Mg content of the L treatment relative \nto PG + L and RG + L treatments must have been the result of \na much higher Ca/Mg ratio in the soil solution of the plots that \nreceived gypsum in addition to limestone and of the increased \nnegative charge in the plots treated with only limestone—the \ncharge being offset by the effect of Ca not displacing Mg from \nthe exchange complex. Magnesium in the PG + L and RG + L \ntreatments saturated the ECEC by 4 and 3.7%, respectively; \nby contrast, Mg in the control saturated it by ?9%. In a study \non Mg availability in acid soils (Udults mainly) from Alabama, \nAdams and Henderson (1962) established 4% saturation of the \nexchange complex by Mg as the threshold for Mg defi ciency in \nthe soil leading to Mg defi ciency in the resulting forage as well.\nAccording to Zaifnejad et al. (1996a, 1996b), applying \ngypsum-rich industrial byproducts from fl ue gas desulfuration\nto Typic Hapludults increased the exchangeable Ca con-\ntents and decreased Al, but elicited no favorable response with \nrespect to the control in an ‘Artur’ wheat crop in biomass production\nor chlorophyll in the leaves, which they ascribed to a \ndecreased availability of Mg. In further work on the same soil, \nZaifnejad et al. (1996a) and Ritchey et al. (1999) found wheat \ncultivated in Ultisols amended with gypsum alone to exhibit \nsevere symptoms of Mg defi ciency and concluded that avoiding\nhypomagnesemia in cattle would require adding some Mg \nto the gypsum amendment. Magnesium defi ciency in wheat \nforage can be worsened by a low availability of P in the soil \n(Reinbott and Blevins, 1994) and also by excessive soil moisture\n(Karlen et al., 1980); these two conditions are prevalent \nin our soils in autumn and winter. Based on the foregoing, the \nMg levels on the soil exchange complex in the plots amended \nwith PG + L or RG + L can result in a risk of hypomagnesemia \nin cattle fed with the crop, especially as a result of the increasing\nloss of Mg with time.\nTable 4.

The differences, however, were only signifi cant for \nthe RG + CBS treatment. After 2 yr, the Na content was significantly\ndecreased with respect to the controls for all treatments, \nthe effect being more marked for the gypsum-treated than the \nonly L-treated soils. The exchangeable K contents exhibited \nno signifi cant differences from the control with any treatment \n1 yr after application; after 2 yr, treatments PG + L and RG + L \nresulted in signifi cantly lower contents relative to the controls, \nhowever. The disparate dynamics of K relative to Mg and Na \ncan be partly ascribed to the fertilizer supplying K and to the \nspecifi city of K adsorption sites in illites and vermiculites (SyedOmar\nand Sumner, 1991). As noted above, the 1 mol L−1 KCl-\nextractable Al content was reduced with respect to the control \nfor all treatments (particularly for the L-treated plots).\nThe water-soluble P (Pw) contents 1 and 2 yr after application\nof the amendments were signifi cantly higher in the L-treated \nplots than in the controls (Table 4), which can be ascribed to the \npH increase in the former. In these soils, phosphate adsorption \nat pH 4.1 to 6.5 is strongly infl uenced by the pH—it decreases \nmarkedly with increasing pH (Espejo and Cox, 1992). With the \nother treatments, Pw contents were lower than those of the controls,\nalbeit not signifi cantly, possibly as a result of the precipita-\ntion of complex phosphates of Al and Ca or even, as suggested by \nPhillips et al. (2000), the precipitation of dicalcium phosphate \nor dicalcium phosphate dehydrate. In Bray-1 P, no signifi cant \ndifferences between treatments were observed. Bray-1 P contents \nin uncultivated Palexerults under cork oak or bushes were in the \nregion of 5 to7 mg kg−1 (i.e., very low) (Espejo, 1993).\nAB Horizon in Plots\nThe main difference in changes in the pH in soil/water \nsuspensions in the AB horizon with respect to the Ap horizon \nwas that neither CBS nor L was as effective in increasing pH \nin the former (Table 5). Two years after the soil was amended, \nall gypsum-treated plots exhibited a pH in water that was signifi\ncantly lower than that of the AB horizon of the controls. \nThis can be ascribed to the salt effect caused by gypsum in the \npercolation water received from the Ap horizon. The origin of \nthe decreased pH must have been Al on the exchange complex \nbeing displaced by Ca from the gypsum. The pH in CaCl2 \nwas not subject to these differences, and all gypsum treatments \nresulted in a signifi cantly increased pH relative to the controls \nas an effect of their containing low levels of exchangeable Al \n(see below).\nThe exchangeable Ca content was signifi cantly increased \nwith respect to the controls for all treatments (Table 5), whereas \nthat of exchangeable Mg was reduced in those plots receiving \nPG + L or RG + L, but increased in those treated with PG + \nCBS or RG + CBS in the Ap horizon. The ECEC saturation by \nMg in the plots treated with PG + L and RG + L was 2.4 and \n2.6%, respectively (vs. 3.5% in the control). The exchangeable \nNa content was reduced for all gypsum treatments. On the \nother hand, the exchangeable K content was affected by none \nof the treatments—for the same reasons as in the Ap horizon.\nThe proportion of 1 mol L−1 KCl-extractable Al was signifi\ncantly reduced by all gypsum treatments (Table 5); with the \nL treatment, the reduction was somewhat lower—albeit not \nsignifi cantly—as a result of the limestone being less soluble \nthan gypsum.\nThe Pw and Bray-1 P contents were very low, with no \nsignifi cant differences between treatments. This was a result of \nthe decreased pH and increased clay and Fe hydrous oxide contents,\nwhich increased P adsorption to a great extent (Espejo \nand Cox, 1992).\nTable 5.

Thus, the gypsum amendments\nincreased the exchangeable Ca contents and decreased \nthe Al contents relative to the controls. The Mg levels were \nsignifi cantly increased in all CBS-treated plots. The increase \nwas, in part, due to Mg being displaced from the Ap and AB \nhorizons, as seen in the RG + L and PG + L plots. Similar \nresults in this respect were previously obtained by Sumner et al. \n(1986). Neither Na nor K changed signifi cantly with respect to \nthe controls, however, partly as a result of the Na received from \nthe Ap and AB horizons.\nThe Pw and Bray-1 P contents were both very low (in the \ncase of Pw, below the detection limit) with no signifi cant differences\nbetween treatments, as in the AB horizon (Table 5). Also \nas in the AB case, the very low P availability is the result of the \nlow pH and increased clay and free Fe hydrous oxide contents.\nAp Horizon in Pots\nSoil in the pots exhibited similar—albeit more marked—\ntrends in pH, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable bases \nand Al to those of the Ap horizon in the plots 2 yr after the \namendments were applied (Table 5). The differences in Ca \ncontents between treatments persisted, but contents were \nslightly lower in the pots than in the corresponding plots. The \nPG + L and RG + L treatments caused the greatest losses of Mg \nfrom the exchange complex, and so did all gypsum treatments \nas regards Na; therefore, the Ca/Mg ratio in the pots containing\nPG + L soil was 20 (vs. 4 in the control) and the ECEC \nsaturation by Mg was 3.2% with PG + L and 2.8% with RG \n+ L (vs. 8.8% in the control). The differences in the evolution \nof the exchangeable base contents between the Ap horizon in \nthe pots and in the plots can be ascribed to better drainage and \nleaching conditions of the former, and to poor drainage in the \nfi eld. Also, a portion of the salts lost through drainage during \nthe rainy season under fi eld conditions returned to the soil by \nascending capillary fl ow from the deeper horizons during the \nsummer (a rainless season with heavy evapotranspiration). As \nnoted above, raña deposits lie on impermeable sediments from \nthe Miocene; this facilitates the formation of perched water \nlayers that rise to the outside very slowly. The Mg content \nof the pots containing CBS-treated soil from the Ap horizon \ncontinued to be signifi cantly higher than those containing Ap \nhorizon soil treated with PG + L or RG + L.\nThe Pw and Bray-1 P content exhibited the same tendencies\nas those in the samples from the Ap horizon in plots 2 yr \nafter the amendment application (Table 5).\nEffect of the Amendments on the Composition of \nSoil Solution in Pots\nThe Mg content of the soil solution in the pots containing \nAp horizon soil amended with PG + L or RG + L was lower—\nalbeit not signifi cantly—than the controls (Table 6); however, \nit was reduced to half. On the other hand, the Ca content was \nsignifi cantly higher (up to about fi ve times); the high Ca concentration\nin the soil solution due to gypsum caused Mg to \nbe displaced from the exchange complex and removed in the \npercolation water as MgSO4; as a result, the Ca/Mg ratio was \n10 times higher in the soil solution from the pots with soil \ntreated with PG + L and RG + L than in the controls. The \nMg content of the soil solution from the pots containing L- \ntreated Ap horizon soil was not signifi cantly different from that \nof the control; this can be ascribed, as discussed above, to a less Ta\nbl\ne \n6.\n M\nea\nn \nda\nta\n o\nf t\nhe\n s\noi\nl s\nol\nut\nio\nn \nfr\nom\n t\nhe\n p\not\ns \n12\n w\nk \naf\nte\nr \nse\ned\nin\ng.\nTr\nea\ntm\nen\nt†\nC\nom\npo\nsi\nti\non\n o\nf s\noi\nl s\nol\nut\nio\nn \nfr\nom\n c\nul\nti\nva\nte\nd \npo\nts\n a\nft\ner\n h\nal\nf l\nea\nch\nin\ng \ncy\ncl\ne\nPr\ned\nic\nte\nd \nac\nti\nvi\nty\n o\nf A\nl s\npe\nci\nes\npH\nEC\n‡\nC\na\nM\ng\nN\na\nK\nSO\n4−\n2\nN\nO\n3−\nF−\nC\nl−\nSi\nA\nl\nZ\nn\nP\nA\nl+\n3\nA\nlO\nH\n§\nA\nlSO\n4¶\nA\nlF#\nµS\n c\nm\n−1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n µ\nm\nol\n L\n−1\n —\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nC\non\ntr\nol\n5.\n17\n a\n††\n58\n.5\n a\n31\n0 \na\n80\n.2\n a\n22\n.8\n c\n34\n.7\n a\n15\n.5\n a\n83\n0 \na\n6.\n2 \nab\n10\n.4\n a\nb\n70\n.3\n b\n17\n.2\n b\n0.\n02\n a\n0.\n08\n a\n2.\n22\n b\n7.\n27\n a\nb\n0.\n03\n a\n4.\n90\n a\nb\nPG\n +\n L\n5.\n41\n a\nb\n46\n7 \nb\n14\n10\n d\ne\n38\n.6\n a\n8.\n7 \na\n27\n.1\n a\n87\n5 \nb\n11\n20\n b\n40\n.3\n e\n12\n.6\n b\n11\n0.\n5 \nd\n25\n.4\n c\nd\n0.\n02\n a\n0.\n08\n a\n0.\n20\n a\n1.\n67\n a\n0.\n12\n a\n19\n.5\n6 \nc\nR\nG\n +\n L\n5.\n39\n a\nb\n53\n2 \nb\n15\n80\n e\n43\n.8\n a\n7.\n6 \na\n28\n.3\n a\n98\n0 \nb\n13\n60\n c\n15\n.7\n c\n10\n.2\n a\nb\n90\n.3\n c\n28\n.3\n d\n0.\n02\n a\n0.\n06\n a\n1.\n29\n a\nb\n9.\n76\n b\n0.\n86\n a\n9.\n90\n b\nPG\n +\n C\nB\nS\n5.\n53\n b\n49\n3 \nb\n12\n60\n c\nd\n68\n0 \nb\n10\n.2\n a\nb\n30\n.2\n a\n12\n75\n c\n12\n80\n b\nc\n32\n.6\n d\n8.\n5 \na\n10\n7.\n6 \nd\n21\n.7\n b\nc\n0.\n02\n a\n0.\n06\n a\n0.\n18\n a\n2.\n40\n a\n0.\n15\n a\n15\n.2\n3 \nc\nR\nG\n +\n C\nB\nS\n5.\n58\n b\n52\n7 \nb\n11\n90\n c\n65\n5 \nb\n14\n.6\n b\n28\n.6\n a\n11\n45\n c\n14\n65\n c\nd\n12\n.3\n b\nc\n9.\n3 \nab\n96\n.2\n c\n23\n.3\n c\n0.\n02\n a\n0.\n04\n a\n0.\n64\n a\n10\n.5\n2 \nb\n0.\n49\n a\n7.\n01\n b\nL\n6.\n33\n c\n10\n5 \na\n97\n0 \nb\n97\n.6\n a\n24\n.1\n c\n32\n.7\n a\n68\n.5\n a\n16\n30\n d\n2.\n8 \na\n8.\n8 \na\n58\n.3\n a\n5.\n7 \na\n0.\n02\n a\n0.\n04\n a\n0.\n01\n a\n4.\n89\n a\n0.\n00\n a\n0.\n32\n a\nLS\nD\n(0\n.0\n5)\n0.\n21\n90\n24\n8\n65\n.7\n4.\n5\n6.\n8\n24\n1.\n9\n22\n0\n9.\n0\n3.\n8\n10\n.7\n4.\n4\n0.\n01\n0.\n05\n \n1.\n40\n3.\n35\n0.\n97\n4.\n60\n† \nPG\n, p\nho\nsp\nho\ngy\nps\num\n; R\nG\n, r\ned\n g\nyp\nsu\nm\n; L\n, l\nim\nes\nto\nne\n; C\nB\nS,\n c\non\nve\nrt\ner\n b\nas\nic\n s\nla\ng.\n‡ \nEl\nec\ntr\nic\nal\n c\non\ndu\nct\niv\nity\n.\n§ \nA\nlO\nH\n =\n a\n[A\nl(O\nH\n)+\n2 ]\n +\n a\n[A\nl(O\nH\n) 2\n+\n].\n¶\n A\nlSO\n4 \n=\n a\n[A\nlS\nO\n4+\n] \n+\n a\n[A\nl(S\nO\n4)\n2−\n].\n# \nA\nlF\n=\n a\n[A\nlF\n+\n2 ]\n +\n a\n[A\nlF\n2+\n].\n††\n W\nith\nin\n c\nol\num\nns\n, m\nea\nns\n fo\nllo\nw\ned\n b\ny \nth\ne \nsa\nm\ne \nle\ntte\nr \nar\ne \nno\nt s\nig\nni\nfi c\nan\ntly\n d\niff\ner\nen\nt a\ncc\nor\ndi\nng\n to\n L\nSD\n (0\n.0\n5)\n.\n', 'SSSAJ: Volume 72: Number 2  •  March –April 2008 409 \nmarked loss of Mg from the exchange complex as a result of \nthe lower Ca concentration (with respect to gypsum-treated \nsoil) in the soil solution and an increase in the negative charge \non the exchange complex.\nThe Mg content in the soil solution of pots containing Ap \nhorizon soil treated with CBS in addition to PG or RG was \nhigh relative to those treated with gypsum and limestone, the \nCa/Mg ratio being much lower than in the controls (Table 6). \nThe Na content was signifi cantly decreased with respect to the \ncontrols by all gypsum treatments, whereas the L treatments \nmaintained the Na levels; the process of Na impoverishment in \nthe gypsum case was the same as that for Mg. Potassium should \nhave exhibited a similar dynamics; however, K losses from the \nexchange complex were offset by the applied fertilizer.\nThe F content of the soil solution from the pots with \nAp horizon soil from the gypsum-treated plots was increased \nwith respect to the controls (Table 6) due to the F present in \nthe natural soil, which was displaced by SO4 (Peregrina et al., \n2007). In these soils, the F content derives from previously \napplied phosphate rock fertilizer (Peregrina et al., 2006). The \nincrease was maximal in the pots fi lled with soil from the plots \ntreated with PG, which contains 12.3 g kg−1 of F (Table 2); \nthe increase in F was accompanied by signifi cant differences in \nSi contents as a result of F dissolving silicates (Arocena et al., \n1995). The lowest F contents were those of the pots fi lled with \nsoil from the plots that where amended with only L, where \nthe pH increase facilitated precipitation of CaF2 (Larsen and \nWiddowson, 1971; Street and Elwaly, 1983; Mackowiak et al., \n2003; Ruan et al., 2004) and F adsorption in the soil matrix: \na pH increase favors precipitation of Al amorphous hydroxides,\nwhich possess a high F– adsorption capacity (Omueti and \nJones, 1977; Ruan et al., 2004). In Palexerults similar to ours, \nGarrido et al. (2003) found the formation and precipitation of \nAl hydroxypolymers to be the main source of Al toxicity alleviation\nfollowing application of liming amendments (Wenzel \nand Blum, 1992).\nThe activity of the most rhizotoxic mononuclear Al3+ species\n(Parker et al., 1989; Kinraide, 1991; Kochian, 1995) was \nreduced with respect to controls by all treatments (Table 6). \nDifferences were not signifi cant with the RG + L treatment, \nhowever, the lowest levels being those in the soil solution from \nthe pots fi lled with L-treated soil; as noted above, this can be a \nresult of the pH increase favoring precipitation of Al as insoluble\nhydroxides. The Al3+ activity was also very low with respect \nto the control in the soil solution from the pots fi lled with \nPG-treated soil due to the high affi nity of Al for F– (Martin, \n1996); because, as noted above, all gypsum-treated soils exhibited\nincreased F contents relative to the controls, such affi nity \nprevented the gypsum treatments from increasing the activity \nof Al–SO4 pairs relative to the controls.\nEffect of Converter Basic Slag on Aerial \nBiomass Production\nField Tests\nDespite the large differences in biomass production, only \nthe plots treated with RG + CBS exhibited a signifi cantly \nincreased output with respect to the control (Fig. 1). This was \na result of the high precipitation in the Cañamero raña during\nthe period November 2001 to April 2002 (viz. 1695 mm \nvs. an annual mean of 830 mm for the period 1963–1996). \nThe excess precipitation affected some areas in the test fi eld \nmore markedly than others and resulted in large production \ndifferences between plots in each block. As a result, while the \nRG-treated plots were more productive than the PG-treated \nplots, differences were not statistically signifi cant at the 0.05 \nprobability level.\nGreenhouse Tests\nThe aerial biomass production in the control was minimal\ndue to the effect of Al3+ toxicity (Peregrina et al., 2006) \n(Fig. 2). As a result of the increase in Ca and decrease in Al, all \ntreatments—particularly RG + CBS—signifi cantly increased \nthe average stem and ear length with respect to the control. \nEar biomass production also was signifi cantly increased by all \ntreatments. The results obtained with L were signifi cantly betFig.\n2. Average aerial biomass production of pots fi lled with soil \nfrom the Ap horizon of the different plots. Statistically signifi cant\ndifferences between means at P < 0.05 are denoted by \nLSD (PG, phosphogypsum; RG, red gypsum; L, limestone; CBS, \nconverter basic slag).\nFig. 1. Average aerial biomass production of the plots in each treatment\nblock. Statistically signifi cant differences between means \nat P < 0.05 are denoted by LSD (PG, phosphogypsum; RG, red \ngypsum; L, limestone; CBS, converter basic slag).\n', '410 SSSAJ: Volume 72: Number 2  •  March–April 2008\nter than those with PG + L, but worse than those with RG + \nL—the differences, however, were not signifi cant.\nSupplying Mg via CBS in combination with the gypsum \namendments signifi cantly increased biomass production of \nstems and ears in the pots relative to the gypsum–limestone \ncombination. This is consistent with the previous results of \nRitchey and Snuffer (2002) for Typic Hapludults that received \ngypsum amendments with or without additional Mg and can \nbe ascribed to the gypsum amendments reducing production \nunless they are supplemented with Mg (i.e., treatments PG + \nL and RG + L). With these two amendments, the Ca/Mg ratio \nwas very high as a result of the loss of Mg and the increased Ca \ncontents, both of which decreased productivity (Carran, 1991).\nIn previous work, Peregrina et al. (2006) ascribed the \ndecreased productivity of PG-treated soils relative to RGtreated\nsoils to the increased Zn content of RG; in fact, this \ntype of soil contains very little Zn (Santano et al., 1993); however,\nthe Zn contents of the soil solutions obtained in this work \nexhibited no signifi cant differences between treatments (Table \n6). Based on our results, the observed production differences \nmay have resulted from an increased activity of Al–F ion pairs \nin the soil solution from the Ap horizon in the PG-treated plots. \nThese ion pairs were formerly deemed nontoxic (Cameron et \nal., 1986; Wright et al., 1987; Tanaka et al., 1987; Noble et al., \n1988; MacLean et al., 1992; Kinraide, 1991), possibly because \nthe soil solutions examined at the time contained them in very \nlow proportions (Kinraide, 1997). Subsequent tests exposed \na potential toxic effect in species such as AlFx\n(3–x), AlF2+ and \nAlF2\n+ (Stevens et al., 1997; Kinraide, 1997), due to their possible\ninterference with P uptake by plants (Facanha and de Meis, \n1995; Facanha and Okorokova-Facanha, 2002). The biomass \nproduction differences between the PG + L and L treatments, \nand the MINTEQ-predicted ionic activities of Al–F ion pairs \nin the soil solution from the Ap horizons that received such \ntreatments, are consistent with this assumption.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Spain’s Ministry of Education for funding this \nwork through Projects AGL-4545-C03-2 and AGF-0828-C03-02. \nFertiberia S.A., Huntsman Tioxide S.A., and Acerinox S.A. are also \ngratefully acknowledged for supplying the waste samples studied.\nREFERENCES\nAdams, F., and J.B.
