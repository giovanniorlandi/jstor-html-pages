S. and Steal\nHorses Is Report.\nWashington. Administration men still declare\nthey have reason to believe Carranza is trying to get his\nmen in line and avoid hostilities. Attitude of his gen\nerals, on other hand, is unpleasant. Trevino's reported\napproval of Carrizal dash and announcement that he\nwould take similar action in same circumstances re\ngarded as indicative of threatening trend of events per\nhaps beyond Carranzais control.\nColumbus, N. M. Mexican bandits are today re\n' ported to have invaded United States 50 miles west of", 'here. Report stated they were running off horses front\nParker\'s ranch in Play as valley, southwest of M achita,\nN. M. Loss of life and fighting were not mentioned.\nWashington, D. C. Sec\'y of War Baker todmy\nissued orders to ever\'ydepartment commander to send\nmilitia forces to border as rapidly as he can equip them\nWashington, June 23. Report\nfrom Gen. Pershing containing story\nof Carrizal fght between Americans\nand Carranzistas based solely on in\nformation of returning Tenth caval\nrymen was in war dep\'t\'s hands to\nday. Its contents were characterized\nas confirming press reports of cav\nalrymen\'s story in most particulars,\nbut officials said they could not rely\nentirely upon it as proving that attack\nwas unprovoked, with Mexicans en\ntirely the aggressors.\nSec\'y Baker refHsed to make pub\nlic text of Pershing\'s message on\nground that it was sot official infor\nmation and because he and Pershing\nregard it as "in the rumor" class.\nSecretary has decided to put lid on\ninformation which is not strictly\nofficial.\nArmy men, generally, said today\nthey did not believe the Carrizal in\ncident, by itself, will provoke war,\nalthough they expressed themselves\nas believing war cannot be avoided\nultimately.\nOfficial statement was made that\nat no time has the president dis\ncussed with any department official\nthe subject of calling for volunteers.\nWatchful waiting was invoked\nanew by the administration today in\nMexican problem. Help in framing\nthis government\'s course presuma\nbly diplomatic, but possibly stronger\nwas anticipated in preliminary re\nport of Gen. Pershinp on Carrizal\nbattle. His report,\' decoded early to\nday, was understood to contain story\nof Tenth cavalry stragglers, putting\nresponsibility for affair upon Mexicans.\nFull official version, based on of\nficers\' reports, was expected from\nPershing during day.\nMeantime war dep\'t activity cen\ntered in getting militia troops ready\nfor bonier service.\nU. S. gov\'t is understood to have\nmade formal request of Great Britain\nto take charge of American interests\nin Mexico should war occur between\nthe two countries.\nEl Paso, Tex. Fate of Capt Lewis\nMoray\'s cavalry detachment which\nwas in Carrazal fight, and possibility\nthat squadron of Eleventh TJ. S. ca\nvalry sent to their relief has also\nbeen engaged by Carranzistas,\ncaused gravest anxiety in official cir\ncles here today.\nNothing has been heard from\nMorey\'s men since battle of Wednes\nday. Gen. Pershing has arranged\nto reinforce relief column if it is at\ntacked by vastly superior number of\nCarranzistas in Carrizal district.\nAbsence of aeroplanes with Amer\nican expedition in Mexico was basis\nof considerable criticism here today.\nAviators could have learned truth\nabout Carrizal situation almost im\nmediately. All aeroplanes intended\nfor scouting with Pershing are dis\nmantled at Columbus base uader\ngoing repairs.\nJuarez today was practically de\nserted, the 4.7 inch guns on Amer\nican side still menacing little. Mexi\ncan city. Gen. Gonzales and handful\nof men still beMeved in Juarez. Ge.\nBell ort Bliss is si id to have in\nformation that considerable Carran\n. .. m.. ? is hidden i hilte aroaM\nJuarez. Troops that evacuated city\nreported to have concentrated 20', "m\nmiles south with other Carranzista '\nforces.\nEl Paso, Tex. Reports received\ntoday by American mining compa\nnies from Mexican sources stated\nthat troops C and K of Tenth U. S.\ncavalry were practically annihilated\nin fighting at CarrizaL No official\nconfirmation.\nSan Antonio, Tex. Plans for dis\ntribution of state militia along border\nprobably will not be made public un\ntil various units have arrived at their\nstations, Gen. Funston indicated to\nday. Perhaps their exact locations\nwill not be divulged even then, as\nFunston does not wish Mexican mili\ntary officials to know just what is his\nstrength and how it is distributed.\nSan Antonio. Gen. Pershing has\nwired Gen. Funston that Mexican\ngarrison has evacuated Casas Gran\ndes. He made no mention of having\noccupied city.\nVera Cruz. Arrival of hundreds ol\nAmerican refugees today fleeing be\nfore war clouds failed to bring anj\nunusual excitement to Mexico's prin\ncipal seaport. Native residents are\noptimistic. Refugees unite in de\nclaring that crowds which greeted\nthem at railroad station on their trip\nhere were fairly courteous.\nOut in the harbor today battleship\nNebraska was lying at anchor with\nnearly 200 American citizens aboard,\nwaiting for transport which is ex\npected within 24 hours to take them\noff.\nTrain from Mexico City last jiight\nbrought several score Americans arid\nseveral hundred other foreigners.\nNot one of these had anything but\nhighest praise for courtesy and po\nlite treatment accorded them by con\nstitutionalist troops and officers in\nMexico City and en route. Twelve\ncarloads of American refugees unde?\ncare of Special Agent Rodgers ex\npected from capital today.\nColumbus, N. M. Spies for de\nfacto government have been watch\ning shipment of troops and supplies\nat Columbus base. One suspect\nunder arrest; several being watched,\nGerman who formerly lived in Mex\nico City many years and came here\nsince Villista raid under-surveillance.\nAs result of spy scare, more vigor\nous precautions have been put into\neffect in base camp, especially at ar\nsenal, containing millions of rounds\nof ammunition.\nWashington. Acting upon instruc\ntions from Gen. Carranza, Mexican\nAmbassador Arredondo today called\nupon a number of Latin-American\ndiplomats and explained the Mexican\nsituation from the Mexican stand\npoint. He told them that constitu\ntionalist troops in Chihuahua had\nbeen instructed not to attack Ameri\ncan troops unless latter take aggres\nsive, while present diplomatic nego\ntiations are pending.\nMexico City. Salvator and Costa\nRica have notified Mexican govern\nment that they will join Mexico in\nopposing invasion by United States,\nit was stated today.\nThough armed conflict with U. S.\nis now considered imminent, Mexi\ncan people still hope for settlement\nof controversy by diplomatic nego\ntiations. Mexico business men expressed\ndisbelief that U. S. would risk de\nstroying her friendly relations with\nLatin-American countries, after la\nboring so hard to establish them, by\nconflict with Mexico. They believe\nAmerican government realizes that\ninvasion of Mexico would arouse hos\ntility against U. S. throughout Cen\ntral and South America, endanger\ning, if not ruining, trade connections\nof American merchants and manu\nfacturers. All classes of people seem to be\nlieve that some way will be found out\nof the difficulty without permanent\nbreach of friendly relations.\nProclamation of War Minister Ob\nregon, calling upon all who have been\nin arms against government to\nabandon that attitude and join Car\nranza forces in case of war with U.\n, S., is expected to bring general re-", 'sponse. Those who have been de\nclared outlaws by Carranaa are ex\ncluded from the call. Those who\ndo not accept call will be considered\noutlaws. Opposition leaders in states\nof Coahuila, Chihuahua, Durango,\nZacatecas and elsewhere, already\nhave recognized constitutionalist\ngovernment.\nSpecial train carrying 150 Amer\nicans left for Vera Cruz this morn\ning. Shamokin, Pa. 16 carloads of am\nmunition consigned to New York\nport for allies was requisitioned in\nNorthumberland yards today by\narmy officers of U. S.

Most\nof the companies are recruited up to\npeace strength and equipment is\nlairly complete.\nTrainload after trainload of meat,\nflour and other provisions were to\nday moving toward the border and\nvarious state camps from Chicago\nand St. Louis.\nIt was announced today, much to\nthe chagrin of the I1L soldiers, that\nthe state troops will probably not go\ninto action in state units.\no o\nASK BRYAN, JORDAN AND WALSH\nTO HELP WARD OFr WAR\nNew York, June 23. Telegrams to C)\nWilliam J. Bryan, Chancellor David\nStarr Jordan of California and Frank\nP. Walsh of Kansas City, urging them\nto meet with prominent Mexicans at\nEl Paso and seek to arbitrate this\ncountry\'s differences with Mexico,\nwere dispatched today by American\nUnion Against Militarism. The union\nheld nearly an all-night session seek\ning some way to ward off impending\nwar. Three Mexicans to whom tele\ngrams urging such an unofficial con\nference were dispatched were Dr.\nAtl, editor of Mexico City; Luis Man\nuel Rojas, director of Biblioteca Na\ncional, Mexico City, and Modesto C.\nRoHand, Mexican engineer located in\nNew York.\nUnion also dispatched messages\nto South and Central America diplo\nmatic representatives in Washington\nurging their endeavor to mediate the\nMexican- American situation.\no o\nNew York.

" -\nHe precipitated the latest Mexican crisis by warning Gen. Pershing\nthat any movement of the American troops except in the direction of tha\nborder would be considered hostile, and bring about an attack by the Car\nrancistas. Pershing moved in defiance of Thevino\'s declaration but Tre\nvino didn\'t attack.\no o-\nNew York. Major H. W.

First of an order of\n7,000 horses and mules for New\nYork\'s militia men arrived today\nfrom the west. It included 700 horses\nand 300 mules, finest lot of its kind\nreceived here in years,', 'BULL MOOSE MAY NOT FOLLOW\nROOSEVELT INTO G. O. P.\nNew York, June 23. Theodore\nRoosevelt may have more trouble\nthan he anticipates in handing the\n4,000,000 Bull Moose voters over to\nthe Republican party. This\'Vas the\ngist of opinion heard in political cir\ncles today, following the report that\nthe colonel was going to ask his for\nmer followers to support Hughes as\nthe only way to defeat Wilson.\nIt is no secret that many of the\nProgressive leaders, such as Ray\nmond Robins, William Allen White,\nVictor Murdock and Harold Ickes, do\nnot relish the idea of following the\ncolonel into the G. O. P. In fact, in\nmany quarters the kick is heard that\nthe colonel\'s action is the result of\na deal with foxy George Perkins and\nthe Old Guard.\nRoosevelt lias sent to the printers\na 3,000-word statement which will\nbe read at the meeting of the Bull\nMoose national committee to be held\nin Chicago Monday. It will point to\nthe present Mexican situation as one\nreason for urging the defeat of Wil\nson. What the fate of the third party\nwill be is hard to guess. It looks now\nas though it will pass out of exis\ntence as a national party and the\nleaders will be divided between Wil\nson and Hughes. Many of the real\nProgressives are for Wilson, it is\nsaid, for his action in appointing a\nman of the caliber of Louis D. Bran\ndeis to the supreme court.\nJas. Garfield has already knocked\nat Hughes\' door and asked to be tak\nen back into the fold. George Per\nkins, who is blamed by the Bull\nMoosers for scuttling the Progressive\nship, seems already fairly started on\nthe way to become one of the Old\nGuard bosses. Several others are\npatting Hughes on the back.\nBut it\'s in the west the west that\nprovided the backbone and spirit of\nthe 1912 fight that rebellion isex\n1 ected. The westerners have sick\nened of the Old Guard; they learned\ntoo much in 1912 ever to fall quietly\nin line again. And it gently hinted\nthey have also sickened of their one--time\nidol, Theodore Roosevelt. It is\nfeared that as a protest against\nRoosevelt and Perkins many of them\nwill be found in the Wilson camp.\nOne part of Roosevelt\'s statement\nthat has angered the Progressives is\nhis reference to Chas. W. Fairbanks.\nAfter praising the G. Q. P. vice pres\nidential candidate, he leaves the Pro\ngressives fre to vote for John M.\nParker, their own nominee, if they\nwish.\nJames Garfield says he believes the\nProgressive national committee will\nendorse Roosevelt\'s statment\no o\nCIGARMAKERS\' UNIONS JOIN IN\nONE BIG ORGANIZATION\nBy unanimous vote the Progressive\nand International Cigannakers\nunions have accepted articles of affil\niation and agreed to unite.\nProgressive union members may\nnow become fullfledged members of\nthe international union. If they do\nnot want to give up their dual system\nof cigarmaking they will be members\nof the special class of the interna\ntional. "This means the beginning of a\nnew era for cigannakers," said a\ncigarmaker. "Cigannakers are now\nin a position to make a united de\nmand for betterment of wages or\nworking conditions."\nIt is expected that the affiliation\nwill.be of great aid to the workers\nin the Havana-American Co. strike.\nFourteen hundred workers in the Chi\ncago and New York factories of this\nfirm are on strike. The firm offered\nthe New York workers a substantial\nraise if they would break with the\nChicago workers, but the New -Yorkers\nrefused the offor.\no o\nCoal in one of the largest new\nmines in China lies so near the sur- .\nface that it will be mined with steam,\nshovels.', "ITS A HABIT DAILY NEWS'\nPETS GETTING JOUTED\nOne after another Daily News pets\nare getting bumped lately.

Northup only want\ned $38,000.\nNorthup's story is a sad one.\nWhen Maclay Hoyne was elected\nstate's attorney it was with the aid\nof the Hearst papers and the opposi\ntion of the Daily News. Victor Law\nson had others in mind he preferred\nin power in the Criminal Court bldg.\nSo when the election was over\nJudge Wm. Fennimore Cooper ap\npointed Northup a special state's at\ntorney to investigate vote frauds\nthat the Daily News contended had\nbeen committed in the election of\nHoyne.\nLawson was supposed to have been\ntickled pink when Northup was ap\npointed, for he was thought to have\nwanted to run him for a big omce\nand the publicity Northup would get\nin the vote fraud prosecutions w.ould\nhelp.\nSo Northup investigated and .he\nDaily News press-agented his quiz.\nA few unfortunate hoodlums were\nheld for voting twice, the News\n. played Northup as a hero and when\nthe matter petered out it was forgot\nten and the News got nothing on\nHoyne.\nWhen it came time for the Daily\nNews pet to put In his bill he- asked\nfor $38,000 of taxpayers' money.

One is between\nthe Daily News and Hoyne. The\nother Is between the Hearst papers,\nwhich backed Hoyne, and Judge W.\nF. Cooper, who started the vote fraud\nquiz which the News wanted.\nIn the Hoyne-News fight the News\nhas been panning him bitterly for his\nattempts to collect the taxes of rich\ndodgers. Stories which cast reflec\ntions on the state's attorney or his\nwork are playe'd by the Lawson pa\nper. Hoyne, on the other hand, has put\na taboo on Daily News reporters.\nThey are not given news in his office\nand what stuff the paper gets it must\nprocure through the City News Bu\nreau, a co-operative ass'n.\nIn the Cooper-Hearst fight the\njudge has filed suits against the Ex\naminer and American for a half mil\nlion dollars because the Hearst pa\npers have been slamming him as un\nfit for duty in certain cases brought\nbefore: Mm.\nThe Hearst papers fought bitterly\nhis re-election to the bench this\nmonth.

It was Hoyne\'s intention to\nstart after Rosenwald if Kesner was\nwhipped in the legal batle.\nThe bump at the hands of the su\npreme court ended one of the most\nspectacular tax campaigns ever seen.\nAs an example to taxdodgers,\nHoyne caused the indictment of Ju\nlius Rosenwald, who is credited with\nholding $30,000,000 worth of Sears\nRoebuck mail order stock.\nReturn of the true bill against Ju\nlius caused some excitement among\ntaxdodgers and for days rich men\nwere calling Hoyne\'s office in an ef\nfort to settle with the state and avoid\nindictment\nThe trust press on the afternoon\nof his indictment played the story\nhard. The Journal had a "scoop"\nand put the story on the street before\nthe bill was returned against the\nmailorder millionaire.\nAs a result of this, the city editor 1\nof the Journal was called before the\ngrand jury and questioned, but not\nprosecuted.\nOn the morning following the\nbreak of the story, led by the Herald,\nthe trust press started making ex-\'\ncuses for the millionaire who failed\nto file a schedule.\nHundreds of big business men\nwere quoted.and they were one in\ndenouncing this attack on the "di\nvine rights" of the taxdodging rich.\nHoyne was panned hard, especially\nby the Herald and News.\nUpon this case Hoyne has based\nhis proposed wealthy taxdodger cam\npaign.

Here we have the\nself-proclaimed "world\'s greatest\n\'newspaper" relating sinister news\nfacts in its editorial columns which\nhave never been given to readers of\nits news columns. If the Tribune\nknows exactly how many rounds of\ndumdum bullet cartridges were deliv\nered and the exact date of delivery,\nwhy doesn\'t the Tribune honestly tell\nthe name of the American manufac\nturer who is doing the job?\nDumdum bullets have been barred\nby international law from so-called\n"civilized warfare." This because a\ndum-dum bullet flattens when it en\nters a human body and tears a gap\nof flesh harder to heal as a wound\nthan the straight, clean hole made by\nregular bullets. If any American\nmanufacturer has been making these\nbullets, the First cavalry boys of Chi\ncago and the First, Second, Sixth\nand Seventh regiment boys of Chi\ncago, not to forget the artillery boyg\ni--also all the mothers and sweet-.\nhearts of these boys-r-have the right\nto know the name of the American\nmanufacturer who made and sold"\ndumdum bullets for delivery in Mex\nico. The Tribune printed its editorial as\none of its many attacks on President\nWilson. One point is clear to peo\nple who think. The Tribune has\nshown them that certain American\nbusiness men are so profit-thirsty\nand money-hungry that they are\nready to make and sell dumdum bul\nlets to Mexico for the killing of\nAmericans. But the Tribune doee\nnot give to its readers the name or\nnames of the American business men\nwho have put profit above patriotism\nand preparedness.\nIf the Ward line steamer Bsperan\nza did arrive at Vera Cruz nine days\nafter the Columbus raid, and did then\nand there make a delivery to the Car\nranzaistas of 1,350,000 cartridges\nwith dumdum bullets for possible use\nin the killing of American soldiers\nlater, why does not the Tribune give\nthe names and addresses of the\nAmerican manufacturers who got\nthe money and took the profits from\nthe sale of these 1,350,000 dumdum\nbullets?

I have\njust pulled some of the hayseed from\nmy hair (I am a grass widow) and I\nwant to tell Allen Steven that the\nreal reason this class of women\ncatch the men is that we, being left\nby our lords and masters of the su\nperior(?) sex, by the grass or sod\nroute, as a rule have also been left\na ready-made home for the man to\nstep into who wants a home some\nother man has made. Therein lies\nthe attraction that a widow holds.\nNeither is it necessarily true that\nwhen a "man secures a divorce from\nhis wife she is ready to love the first\nman that appears, for she probably\nhas enough to be grateful for to be\nrid of No. 1.\nAccording to Allen, "If Eve had\nbeen an old maid, Adam would not\nhave fallen." The bible has never\nmade note of the fact that Eve was\na widow. If she had a husband other\nthan Adam, who was he and what\nbecame of him?\nAllen refers to the single state of\nDorothy Dix, Helen Oldfield" and\n"others of that hopeless class." How\ndoes he know that these noble wom\nen are old maids? They are not, in\nall probability, as fond of seeing their\nreal names in print as is. our distin\nguished critic.

The\nvery savant who considers dealing\nwith knowledge the noblest employ\nment of the human faculties must\nlearn that knowledge is not a private\ndomain reserved for a few adepts ut\ntering oracles before a public of Ig\nnoramuses, who take them at their\nword. Art and literature belong to\nthe masses.\nThe live the dream, realize the as\npiration, one must work for the\nmoral and intellectual elevation of\nthe masses. They, too, must under\nstand that their own development is\nmade up of the intellectuality of all;\nthat whatever the heights they be\nlieve they have attained, they belong\nto the multitude.\nIf they strain to rise above the mul\ntitude a thousand bonds hold them\nto it, fetter their action and their\nthoughts? preventing them forever\nfrom reaching the summits they\nhave glimpsed.\nIn science, as in art and literature,\nthe faculties of judgment, observa\ntion and comparison do not differ\nfrom the faculties employed in occu\npations which they consider more\nvulgar.\nIn spite of intellectual compres\nsion which has held humanity down\nfor so many centuries, science has\nbeen able to progress and develop,\nthanks to the critical-spirited indi\nviduals refractory to official teaching\nand ready-made conceptions.\nIt is from all human knowledge\nthat the general\' synthesis must pro\nceed.

Wel\ncome to the lady contributors of The\nForum. We always like to see or\nhear them. The "erring woman" and\n"mate-seeking" letters are justly\npopular. While the subject is hot I\nshall write of a pure woman who was\nwronged by a cop.

I shall\nshow that it is better to follow St.\nPaul\'s advice and abjure women.\nThis woman is beautiful and was\npure until the day she asked a State\nstreet crossing cop about a car bound\nfor Division street. The villain indi\ncated a north-bound car and the\npoor innocent boarded it Arriving\nat Lake street she discovered that\nshe had been betrayed. She had\ngone wrong. The conductor was very\n"fresh." Like most men, he possessed\nsuch a degree of hatred for a prety\nfallen woman that he could hardly\nKeep his hands off her.\nNow, every well-trained person\nknows that a woman gone wrong is\na harpy. This harpy is as sweet and\nseductive as she was before the cop\nruined her. Therein is the danger.\nTherein is the devil\'s way of disguis\ning his own. Brazenly, she blames\nthe man, of course, saying the cop\nled her astray. The cop does not\nworry, but is getting a trifle stouter,\nthey say.\nHaving learned these grewsome\ndetails, I have been able to save the\nVirtue of a large number of Walton\nplace philosophers and of myself (ap\nplause from the Newberry library),\nall of whom were her admirers be\nfore her fall.\nLadies, never err. If you do we\nmust shun you (during the daytime).\nAnd, Oh, men, beware the fallen\nwoman !

If\npeace and harmony reigned on earth\nthe lawyer would be out of a job.\nThat great drama enacted on Cal\nvary 1,900 years ago was to show the\ngreat power of man nonresistance\nand how he could\' preserve his\nmind without the assistance of the\ncollege professor.\nThe Christians are not the follow\ners of Jesus or His teachings, as they\nhave no respect for the command\nment of God. They have no knowl\nedge of the plan of human life.
