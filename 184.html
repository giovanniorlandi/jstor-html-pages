Carranza\'s\nsuperiority in military prestige and]\nstrength is today conceded by every\none, and he is said to have given the\nTan-American governments (lie assur\nances they required.\nThe situation isn\'t calculated to give\nunalloyed pleasure to any of these\ngovernments. There is no love lor\'\nCarranza either at Washington or at\nany of the important Latin- American\ncapitals. The A 11 C powers were, a\nshort time ago, more thoroughly op\nposed to the .arrogant old Don than |\nwas l\'residen\'t Wilson himself, though\nfor a different reason, our govern\nment was irritated by Carranza\'s con\ntinual Hunting of American rights and\ndignity, though in sympathy with the\nprinciples he possessed. The A Li C\ngovernments had been given less\ncause of offense than the United Slat\nes, but were hostile to his radical |\npolicies.\nAltogether, ll is simply making the\nbest ol a bad situation. Carranza, at\nleast, does not owe his power to as\nsassinalion, as Uuerla "did: lie lias a\ndefinite theory and program of govern\nment: and he has shown will powei\nwhich Madero lacked, lie is a stub\nborn, arrogant old man who may turnj\ntyrant; but lie is the most available\nman in a country which, but tor him,\n(?flers -no hope of escape from death\na?.*l destruction. Recognition of him j\nmay help to hasten the slaving pro\ncess.\nIn agreeing to recognize Carranza,\nthe administration seems to have been\ninfluenced strongly by the Latin-Amer\nican governments. And that Is prop\ner enough. Our interests In Mexico\nare greater than theirs, hut they are\nbetter qualified than we to understand\nthe Mexicans and their needs. The\nagreement of the Yankees and the\nLatins in this matter Is another im\nport ant step in the development of the\nnew Pan- Americanism.\nTHE QUEST\nFOR TRUE NEWS.\nFEW newspaper readers appreciate\nthe pains to which editors go to veri\nly the news they print. They don\'t\nsucceed all the time, and in fact sel\ndom succeed in being wholly veraci\nous throughout a single issue, but they\nhonestly try. Their failure Is due\nchiefly lo the practicable impossibility\nof getting absolutely accurate reports\nof events, even from eye-witnesses.\nAny experience Judge or lawyer will\nrecognize this difficulty. When re\nports come at second or third hand,\nespecially when persons not trained as\nreporters are depended on. the chanc\nes for error, intentional or uninten\ntional. are of course greatly increas\ned.\nThe New York World two years ago\nestablished a bureau of accuracy and\nfair play for the purpose of sifting the\nstories sent in by "rural correspond\nents" having found that news matter\nfrom such sources was most often\ncalled in question. It recently made\npublic a report of its work.\nOf 787 cases in which the truth of\nnews stories had been questioned, 108\nwere sustained and 291 were found lo\nbe either unfounded on fact or Incor\nrectly reported. In all the hitler can- j\nes, corrections were printed. Many J\nof the correspondents were discharged.\nThe Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journ\nal. commenting on this inv-stigit\'ton. |\nsnys: "If every paper in the land\nwould join In a crusade to end fnking,\nit would not bu long before the corre\nspondents who write these stories 011\nspace would give over futile etrorts\nto break into print."\n?? <\nWHAT INTERESTS\nWOMEN.\nA NEW YORK philosopher has been\nobserving women in the subway und\nat the movies, with a special view to\nlinding what measure of interest they\nhave in public events.\nin the subway he noticed that while\n85 men out of every 100 are reading\nnewspapers, only 4 women in a hun\ndred are doing so. There were 30\nwomen in 100 reading novels and story\nbooks and 0 reading magazines; Co\nper cent of them were gazing into the\nair. The 4 per cent occupied with\nnewspapers \'found only the bargain\nand women\'s pages interesting."\nThen he visited a moving picture\nshow. When "silly love pictures" were\nshown, the Women seemed to enjoy\nthem immensely. Ilut as soon as won\nderful historical pictures and scenes)\nof the big outside world were thrown\non the screen, lie heard women all |\naround him murmuring, "These pic\ntures make me tired," "That\'s silly,"\nand "That stuff is disgusting." Many |\nof them walked out of the theater.\nThe men, on the contrary, were keen\nly interested in such scenes.\nFrom which the philosopher infers\nthat before those women are ready for\nthe ballot, they must develop a new\nset of interests.\nAnd as a matter of fact, is any\nwoman, in New York or anywhere else,\nproperly equipped to vote if she\ndoesn\'t read the news and isn\'t in\nterested in news pictures? Or any\nman, either, for that matter?\nNOW the head of the "Big Brother\nmovement" offers 1,000,000 schoolboy\nguards to defend the nation, lteally,\nisn\'t this defense business being over\ndone?

These\nboys have sent a challenge to the boys\nof the Elko High school: "We want\nto give a California yell to you at the\nstation. Are you with us." Well, any\none who knows the Elko boys knows\nwell where they will be when the train\npulls in.

This is rapidly becoming\none of the most important pieces of\nwork carried on under the extension\nsystem of the University of Califor\nnia. From each school annually a\nprize winner Is selected.
