The Lenten seasoL is a dull one no\ndinner parties, no dances, no receptions so the\ntwo roally noteworthy anecdotes filled a gap in\nhe season of amusement.\nThe dramatis personue of the first story in\neludes a celebrated statesman rather on in\nyears, who wears glasses. While trying to ad\njust them to bis aquiline nose thoy slipped\nfrom bis fingers not to the floor, but down\nthe low-cut gown of a young navy matron who\nwas standing in front of him.\nThe statesman waj in despair, and finally ap\npealed to the lady\'s husband to recover his\nproperty. With the usual thoughtlessness of\nmarried men, Mr. Husband reached down his\nwife\'s back and fished out the glasses before\nall the guests.\nThe other laughable incident came when a\ncareless dancer caught her hand in the impos\ning coiffure of a stately white-haired Wash\nington matron, displacing several of the puffs\nand curls. Much chagrined, she fixed it back\nagain, but, alas! at least $30 worth of the\npuffs had fallen to the ground.\nAn absent mindeJ Admiral of National re\nnown picked up the snow-white puffs, mistak\ning them for his pocket handkerchief, put\nthem in his pocket and stalked majestically\noff to his carriage\nWHEN HER BACK ACHES.\ni A Wunian Kinds All Her Energy and\nj Ambition Slipping Away.\nMayrvillo women know how the aches and\npains that come when the kidneys fail, to\nmake life a burden. Backache, hip pains,\nheadaches, dizzy spells, distressing urinary\ntroubles, all tell of siok kidneys and warn you\nof the stealthy approach of diabetes, dropsy\nand Bright\'a disease Doan\'s Kidney Pills\npermanently cure all of these disorders. Here\'s\nproof of it in a Maysville woman\'s words:\nMrs. John Burns of Maysville, Ky., says: "I\nvalue Doan\'s Kidney Pill\'s just as highly today\nas when I gave a statement for publication in\ntheir favor some years ago. I was subject to\nattacks of kidney trouble and at times the pain\nin my back was so acute that I wbb confined to\nmy bed for days. The prompt relief I re\nceived from Doan\'s Kidney Pills, procured\nat J. J. Wood & Son\'s Drugstore, was very\ngratifying, and daring the years which have\nsinco elapsed, I have had no serious return of\nkidney trouble. On some occasions, I bave felt\na slight backache, but a few doses of this val\nnable remedy have never failed to ward off any\nbad attack."\nFor sale by all dealers.
