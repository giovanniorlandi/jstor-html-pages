After sketching\nOen. Buller\' Intentions, as communi\ncated to Sir Charles Wnrren, who\ncommanded the whole force, Lord\nRoberts points out that Gen.

Allen will spend at least a week\nat Sun Juuu before his formal inaugu\nration, und In that time It is ex\npected that he will be able to form\na correct estimate of the qualifica\ntions of leading natives for places in\nthe eecutlve council, which consti\ntutes the upper house of the legisla\ntive assembly, and be in a position\nto make recommendations to the pres\nident icgaidllig appointments. It Is\nthe InipicHslou among cabinet officers\nthat most of the men now holding\noffices In Gen.

If Mr. Griffin and his asso\nciates had started out with a fair ap\npeal for half a million dollars; or If.\nhaving started out for a million, they\nhad been willing to compromise and\naccept half a nillll en dollars; or If,\nhaving shown such a determination to\nride rough shod over all opponents, to\nstyle all who spoke of half a million as\nfcp3 of the centennial, and to bulldoze\nthe legislature and the governor to\nsurrender when they cried out, "Hold\nup your hands;" If they had not knif\ned every measure which they thought\nmight conflict with their grab; In oth\ner words, If they had only been decent,\nand fair ami sensible, Toledo would\nnow without the slightest doubt be\n?nlng on with her centennial prepara\ntions with at least half a million dol\nlars In sight from tho state, and posl\n!y three quarters of a million, In stead\nif having nothing and abandoning the\nwhole enterprise.\nMr. Griffin is the man chiefly respon\nsible for the centennial failure.

If It is conccdr.l that\nthe prices until recently maintained\nweie Justified by the conditions of sup\nply and demand, no sufficient charge\ncan be seen In these conditions to pus-\ntify \'the late drop In ciude prices,\nThere are reports of.

The great responsibility of the\nfirst of thee causes for the shorten\ning of man\'s life it is true has been of\nlate year vigorously denied. Exper\nience, it ts claimed, shows that com\nplete rest from work in many cases\nrather hastens than delays death, and\ntho perception of this fact lias mater\nially affected the old practice of retir\ning from business when a competency\nwaa acquit cl. The examples of vig\norous activity In public affairs nfford\ned by the aged Gladstone nnd the still\nmore aged Pope Leo have convinced\nmany that work Is a good thing for\npeople of all ages, and the many\ndeaths which havo followed veiy\nclosely In the cases of these who, after\nleading an active life, have suddenly\nquit all work and business, havo con\nduced to teach the same lesson. Of\ncourse, excessive work Is baj for per\nsons of all ages, but hard work and\nplenty of work does net necessarily\ncomo under this caption. There are\na lot of folks who. however, class all\nkinds of work under the same caption\nand act as though they thought any\ntcasonable occupation was detrimental\nto health, and rhey devote all their\ntime trying to do nothing. When ask\ned for a reason they quote the old saw\nabout work and worry being danger\nous to life\'s duration Many such, it\nmay be observed, havo filled early\ngraves or asylums.\nThere are many who,-while agreeing\nto the desirability cf work as a pro\nmoter of health and longevity, will\nnevertheless hold firmly to the belief\nthat worry Is a mighty factor in reduc\ning man\'s length of lay3. They are\nparticularly strong In their belief that\nit causes mental disorders which\nbreak down tho physical system and\ngreatly curtail man\'s life. But this\npopular modern idea that worry Is at\ntho before of most of the nervous\ntroubles of the present day is negative\nby the observations of Dr. Cloustcn, of\ntho Royal Edlnburg asylum.

Without doubt\nthe present generation Is apt to coddle\nIts nerves, and almost to plume Itself\non tho delicacy of its organization. It\nis \'widely held that so great Is the In\nfluence of worry In the production of\nncrvo disease that those prono to ner\nvous break-down should be In every\nway protected from Irritating and dis\nturbing Influences. The medical pro\nfession Is not entirely without blame\nIn this matter. The phrase, \'It Is\nworry, not work, that kills, has re\nceived high and wide professional san\nction, and it is to bp feared that we are\nfar too ready to presciiba a placid\nmental life rather than llgid bodily\nregimen."\nThere would seem to be much that Is\nworthy of \'consideration in this. Com\nplete rest for the bodily members it is\nknown does not conduce to their\nstrengthening or to the general long\nevity cf the whole" physical organiza\ntion. The same it Is reasonable to as\nsume may bo true of man\'s mental or\nganlzitlcn. Parts cf :he latter are ex\nercised by anxiety and woriy which\nare left dormant when such Is absent.\nThe exercise of these parts may\nstrengthen them and the wholo mental\norganization, while complete rest for\nthem may have tho contrary effect.

But he for\ngets to s\'tate that before t\'he Eastern\nRepublic thought about sitting down\nat the feet of the United States it pull\ned a knife and gun, and in a mo3t vic\nious manner proceeded to make the\nplace a mlro of blcod rather \'than a\npeaceful Men In which to sleep and\ndream and \'thporlze,\nAgulnaldo and his Insurgent follow\ners had no notion of sitting down as\nMr. Hoar would believe, and until the\nmilitary strength of the Federal gov\nernment put them down, there could\nbe no love feat and Oriental concep\ntions of tobacco, black coffee, and a\nrug beneath a bough wrereon to loll\nand rhapsodize.
