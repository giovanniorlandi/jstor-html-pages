        <pre>['The Wibaux aPinneef\nVOLUME 4\nWIBAUX, DAWSON COUNTY, MONTANA, FRIDAY. AUGUST 12, 1910\nNUMBER 34\nTHE WIBAUX\nTIGERS WIN\n"Dicky Birds" got an\nother charge of salt\nSat. and Sun.\nThe Wibaux Tigers added two\nmore scalps to their collection of\nrelics on last Saturday and Sun\nday when they quietly slipped up\non the "Dicky Birds" with their\nhands full of salt, and walked off\nwith the game. Of course we do\nnot infer that it was done in Indian\nfashion, but rather in clean, well\nplayed exibitions.\nOwing to the lateness of the\neast bound train the Saturday\ngame was not called until (5 o\'clock\nand consisted of but seven innings.\nJennings pitched for the Tigers\nwhile Hughs ami Burdette were in\nthe box for Dickinson, and after\nseven hard innings had been play\ned the score loomed up 6 to 4 in\nfavor of the locals. In the sixth\ninning Jennings got kind hearted\nhaving hit two men, walked two,\nand allowed a hit by manager\nHughs, coupled with Tennants er\nror gave Dickinson the only scores\nthey secured throughout the game.\nHughs and Burdette allowed 9 hits\nas against Jennings 4. It was a\nwell played game, with a fair siz\ned crowd in attendance.\nScore by innings:\nWibaux— 2020002 * *—6\nDickinson—0 0 0 0 0 0 4 * *—4\nSUNDAY GAME 8-4\nSunday\'s game was also an in\nteresting one with an attendance\nequal to double that ot the prev\nious game, and considerable mon\ney was wagered on the result.\nThe game was called at three\no\'clock with Ford pitching for Wi\nbaux and Burdette in the box for\nDickinson? The first time up to\nbat Wibaux was passed a goose\negg while Dickinson got one score,\nbut after this inning the locals\nscored most every time up. Ford\npitched good ball, allowing but\n6 hits and passing only 3 men.\nwhile Burdette allowed thirteen\nhits, und walked three men.\nIn the 3rd inn in g Smith walked,\nTucker hit and sent Smith to 3rd\nmaking second on the next pitch\ned ball. Then came Jennings\nwith a two base hit scoring both\nmen on bases, and later scoring on\na hit by Ditclnnnn.

Tucker\nmade a sensational catch in center\nfield by gathering one off nis shoe\nstrings, and Ditchman made a\nwonderful one handed stop on a\nthrow to second base, which pre\nvented a man from scoring. Mic\nhcal Anthony Griffin\'s playing at\n3rd base was noteworthy especially\nfor his fast and accurate throwing\nto first from deep third: Mike also\ngot a couple of good wallops at\nthe sphere during his stry in Dick\ninson. Tne locals played machine\nlike ball all the time, making only\nthree errors in the two games and\ngetting 22 hits, against Dickinson\'s\n10 hits and 7 errors. The Dickin\nson players evidently lmd a corner\non the four score propsition, hav\ning got that number in all three of\nthe games with Wibaux this seas\non.\nAt any rate Dickinson appears\nto be the best town along the line\nin which to play ball, as the locals\nexpress themselves as being well\npleasetl with the treatment on all\noccasions while there, and would\nno doubt be glad to schedule an\nother game on their grounds this\nseason.\nThis evening, the Tigers, some\nwhat crippled but full of "pep"\nand determination, take No. 7 for\nMiles City where they will play\nSaturday and Sunday. A week\nfrom Sunday Sidney, the strong\ninland town is expected here for\ntwo grmes, and the locals go there\non the 30th and 31st to play dur\ning the Old Settler\'s Reunion at\nthat place 1\nLocal News Notes\nSubscribe for the Pioneer—.\nYou are sure to get good goods\nat honest prices when you patron\nize Pioneer advertisers.\nLost—an auto lifting jack, with\ninitials N V T engraved on same.\nFinder please return to this office\nami receive reward.\nDon\'t forget the photo gallery,\nnext door to the Pickering.

Failed and\nJ. R. Cornell Did\nThe Honors\nSt. Cloud (Minn.) Daily Times,\nJuly 28.—That it was necessary\nfor a brewer to act as the reception\ncommittee for Carrie Nation yes\nterday was one of the amusing in\ncidents of her visit to this city.\nAmong the people who went to the\nPark yesterday were the lady mem\nbers of the family of J. R. Cornell\nvice-president of the Preiss & Wim\nmer Brewing Co. Mr. Cornell\ndrove the ladies to the park and\nthen returned to the Grand Cent\nral hotel to buy a cigar. As he\nstopped at the curb to hitch his\nhorse a bell boy came out and joc\nularly said to the brewer:\n"Carry is inside and is waiting\nfor you." Cornell replied: "Is that\nso?" and went inside and bought a\ncigar at the desk. The said that\nMrs Nation had been anxiously\ninquiring for somebody to get to\nthe park. She evidently expected\na reception committee to appear\nbut was beginning to get anxious\nabout the delay. She asked when\nthe next street car would go to the\npark. Then those about the desk\ndared Cornell to take her down.\nGoing over to Mrs. Nation he said;\n"1,11 take you to the park if you\nwish."\n"Are you the reception commit\ntee? asked Carrie. "No" said\nCornell, " but they told me that\nyou were anxious to start and I\'ll\ntake you." So she called for her\ngrip and Mr. Cornell escorted her\nto his carriage. As they got out\nside Mrs. Nation said to him: \'\'I\nwish you would give me that ci\ngar," pointing to the havana that\nthe brewer had just lighted. "Cer\ntainly, replied Cornell remember\ning his gallantary. "Now I am\ngoing to bless you with this cigar,"\nsaid Carrie and suiting the action\nto her words crushed the fragrant\nweed under her masculine heel on\nthe stone pavement. Then she pro\nduced a big hatchet and decorated\nCornell. On the way to the paik\nMr. Cornell asked her how many\ntimes she had been in jail, and how\nshe liked the lecture platform and\nkindred subjects; hoping all the\ntime that the noted prohibitionists\nwould ask him his business because\nhe had determined to tell her, but\nshe did not.\nArriving at the Park he saw that\nshe could not carry her grip and\nget through the crowd, so he asked\nher to wait until he tied his horse\nand then taking her grip escorted\nher to the platform. It is needless\nto say that the appearance of a\nbrewer decorated with a hatchet,\ncarring Carrie Nation\'s grip and\nescorting her to the platform creat\ned a sensation. The crowd caught\non in a minute cheering and shout\ning lustily. Doubtless Carrie\nthought she was getting an enthu\nsiastic reception. Whether she\ndiscovered the joke before she left\ntown is not known.\nCHICAGO LIVE\nSTOCK MARKET\nChicago Union Stock Yards, 111.\nAug. 11, 1910—Receipts of west\ntern range cattle here last week\ntotaled 13,600, comhared with\n4,600 the previous week and 3,700\nlike period a year ago.

By resolution, the congress\nadopted plans for carrying out the sug\ngestions that were given in the secre\ntary\'s annual report, as follows:\n"During the year very important de\nvelopments have demanded recogni\ntion of the necessity for larger plans\nIn considering future work. Every\nstate in the west, and many states\neast of the proposed line of demarca\ntion between the semi-arid and the\nrain-belt districts, lias given evidence\nof lively interest in the congress and\nIts work. Editorial utterances in\nleading newspapers in New Hamp\nshire, Tennessee, New York and other\neastern states indicate that the suc\ncess of the congress means untold\nwealth in added agricultural produc\ntion in sections of the east where\ndrought Is an element to be combatted\nby the farmer. Official communica\ntions from officers of the agricultural\ndepartments of many nations indicate\nthat the successful working out of the\nproblems before this congress will\npermanently affect the prosperity of\nthese nations and that it is the duty\nof this great organization to spread\nits educational work into every part\nof the world.\n"The organization of the Texas Dry\nFarming congress through the untir\ning work of Committeeman Martin of\nthe general congress was a triumph\nwhich shows plainly the advancement\nmade by this movement and the pos\nsibility of organizing local state or\nganizations for the purpose of arous\ning local interest among farmers in\ntheir own behalf in the greater study\nof the world problem. Your secre\ntary suggests that—while there should\nbe no cessation of the work along the\nlines already tixed by the past experi\nence and by the constitution of the\ncongress—there should he a greater\neffort to establish the work through\nlocal organizations which should co\noperate officially under the constitu\ntions, with the parent organization,\nand to push the membership of the\ncongress into every section where dry\nfarming may be considered helpful In\nadvancing agricultural interests.\n"As a means of fixing official fed\neral interest in the congress in every\nnation it would be well to organize\n"Divisions" for the various nations or\nempires throughout the world. The\ndivision of the British empire, for in\nstance, should contain "Sections" of\nthe Dominion of Canada, the com\nmonwealth of Australia, the Dominion\nof New Zealand, the Union of South\nAlrica, India and Egypt. This plan can\nbe followed with the nations of the\nearth. No constitutional lines can be\ntixed at the fourth congress, but sanc\ntion should be given to the administra\ntive officers for the working out of the\nsuggestions and the preliminary estab\nlishment of the work during the year,\nthe final detailed plans to be submit\nted and results of correspondence and\nInternational work to be reported to\narth congress."\nLegal Notices\nNOTICE FOR PUBLICATION\nDepartment of the Interior, U.

Then fol\nlow with a saucer containing about four\nheaping teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts,\ntreated with a little rich cream.

Their waving plumes and fine\nuniforms were fittingly set off by the\nbeautiful decorations of the streets and\nbuildings, and the scene was one that\nwill not soon be forgotten by those\nwho were fortunate enough to witness\nit.\nTil\'s magnificent parade was the\nclimax, in a spectacular way, of the\nthirty-first triennial conclave of\nKnights Templar, which opened here\non Sunday, Aug. 7. In accordance\nwith the time honored custom of the\ngrand encampment, the doings of the\nweek began with divine service.\nBegin With Divine Service,\nThe sir knights selected Orchestra\nhall for this purpose and entirely filled\nActing Grand Master Melish.\nthe body of that hall to listen to a\nsermon on "Templarism" delivered by\nRev. Dr. George H. MacAdam of Madi\nson, Wis., in the absence of Sir Knight\nGeorge C. Rafter of Cheyenne, Wyo.,\nvery eminent grand prelate of the\ngrand encampment. The music was\nin charge of the grand organist of the\ngrand commandery of Illinois, the\nchoir consisting of several male quar\ntets belonging to the order in this\nstate. The Grand Encampment of the\nUnited States marched to the hall es\ncorted by sir knights of the various\ncommanderies of Cook county, com\nmanded by Benjamin S. Wilson, chair\nman of the escort committee. In many\nof the leading churches of the city\nspecial services were held which were\nattended by visiting knights and their\nfamilies.\nMonday was devoted mainly to the\nreceiving of the grand and subordinate\nfcommanderies and escorting them to\ntheir hotels. It is estimated that fully\n100,000 visitors came with the knights\nand that about 300,000 other excur\nsionists have flocked to the city this\nweek in consequence of the conclave.\nOf course every hotel was thronged\nand thousands of the visitors found\nquarters in private residences.\nOn Monday evening all the local\nand visiting commanderies kept open\nhouse at their respective headquar\nters, and many of the visitors found\ntheir way to the various amusement\nparks and the theaters.\nParade of The Knights.\nThe "grand parade" of Tuesday was\nthe largest parade of Knights Templar\never held. The preparations were\nelaborate and Michigan boulevard was\nmost elaborately decorated. The sir\nknights formed in line of march on\nthe boulevard south of Thirty-first\nstreet, and signal to move was given\nby the guns of Battery B, I. N. G., the\ndetachment for the purpose being\ncomposed of Knights Templar all of\nwhom are members of the battery.\nThe same detachment fired the salute\nto the grand master.\nMarching northward in Michigan\nboulevard, the parade passed, near\nHubbard court, beneath an entrance\narch built in the form of an ancient\nbattlement with its towers and tur\nrets. This was intended to represent\nthe entrance to the city, and as the\ncolumn passed under it, buglers sta\ntioned on its heights heralded the ap\nproach of each grand division.\nNext the knights came abreast of\nI era* tcriuad stand, one-half mile In\nlengih. and this needed nn decora\ntions, for it was filled to Its capacity\nmainly with ladies whose beautiful\nsummer costumes made it like a vast\ngarden. About 50,000 persons were in\nthis immense stand, as at its center\nwas a gorgeous throne on which sat\nthe acting grand master, William\nBromwell Melish of Cincinnati, who\nbecame head of the order on the re\ncent death of Grand Master Henry W.\nItugg of Providence, R. I. Mr. Melish\nwill be regularly elected grand master\nbefore the close of the conclave.\n.fust north of the Art Institute the\nparade passed before another review\ning stand in which were Mayor Busse,\nthe city council and the park commis\nsioners.\nBeautiful "Templar Way."\nAt Washington street the marchers\nturned west to State, where they en\ntered on the "Templar Way." This\nstretch extended from Randolph to\nVan Buren street and was made beau\ntiful by a handsome arch and massive\nCorinthian columns of pure white\nerected thirty-three feet apart on both\nsides of the street. Festoons of natur\nal laurel connected the columns, and\nthe bright red cross and the shield\nand coat of arms of the order were\nprominent in the scheme of decora\ntion.\nMoving south to Jackson boulevard,\nthe knights again turned west, and\nnear the federal building passed be\niore yet another reviewing stand\nwhich accommodated Governor Deneen\nand his staff. Marching north on La\nSalle street, the parade passed be\nneath the grand commandery arch of\npure white which spanned the street\nat the La Salle hotel, the headquarters\nof the grand commandery of Illinois.\nThis w r as a beautiful structure de\nsigned by one of Chicago\'s most fa\nmous sculptors. Upon its top stood\nthe figures of mounted knights four\nteen feet high. At the new city hall\non Washington street the parade was\ndismissed, after marching forty-three\nblocks.\nCare For the Marchers.\nEverything that could be thought\nof for the comfort of the paraders and\nthe spectators was done by the local\ncommittees. In neSrly every block\nalong the line of march were station\ned physicians who were also knights\ntemplar, with trained nurses and\nequipment for emergency cases. In\naddition, emergency hospitals to be\nkept open day and night during the\nconclave were established at many\npoints in the center of the city, and\nat the West Side ball park which was\nselected as the place for the competi\ntive drills.\nWednesday and Thursday were the\ndays set apart for the drills for which\nhandsome trophies are awarded, and\nband concerts, sight seeing and many\nreceptions were on the program.\nEntrancing Scenes at Night.\nThe scene in the streets at night\nwas especially beautiful, for all the\narches, festoons and columns of the\ndecorative scheme were brilliantly il\nluminated, and on State street, in ad\ndition to the "Templar Way," the mer\nchants had put up decorations thal\ntransformed the great shopping di3\ntrict into a veritable fairly land.\nUndoubtedly the most spectaculai\nfeature of the night display was the\nwonderful electric set piece erected\nin Grant park on the lake front, re\nproducing in colossal size the official\nemblem or badge of the conclave. It\nwas 150 feet hieh and its 5,000 power\nful electric lights of varied colors\nbrilliantly illuminated all that part ol\nthe city.\nMuch of the success of the conclave\nmust be attributed to the efforts ol\nJohn D. Cleveland, grand commander\nof Illinois and president of the tri\nennial executive committee. Arthur\nMac Arthur of Troy, N. Y„ is the very\neminent grand generalissimo of the\ngrand encampment and W.

It requires sever\nal years hard work to place them\nupon a firm foundation.\nThe site for the poultry house and\nyard should be selected with an idea\nfor natural drainage. A knoll pr ridge\nis a preferable location.\nRats are very troublesome if they\nonce get their runways established un\nder or near the poultry hofise. Cement\nfloors are a great protection.\nAn inside coat of whitewash is bene\nficial. Use a thick whitewash and\nadd a little crude carbolic acid which\nwill help to destroy disease germs and\nCHINESE PIGS FLOOD LONDON\nTraders Find English Market Inviting\nOne for Swine, Poultry, Fish,\nWheat and Timber.\nLondon.—There has been a remark\nable development of the "Chinese pig"\nInvasion during the last few days.\nThree thousand six hundred and\nforty-seven carcasses of Chinese pigs,\nbrought from Woosung, are lying in\nthe hold of the steamship Graf Murav\njef, which has just arrived from China.\nIt is stated that two or three more\ncargoes of Chinese pigs are on their\nway from Woosung to London.\nThe Graf Muravjef brings, in addi\ntion to 3,647 Chinese pigs, thousands\nof poultry, 100,000 frozen salmon from\nthe River Amur, and an Immense\nquantity of eggs "in bulk," besides\nManchurian wheat and timber.\nSecond Marriages Happiest.\nNew York.—"As a rule Becond mar\nriages are the happiest," said Judge\nA.
