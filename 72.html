This is a highly important\nruling as it by a very natural law\napplies to all other fabrics and all\nother goods. Indeed, it is a death\nblow to false advertising. It is a\njudgment to the effect that what a\nman purports to sell, he really must\nsell Thus, if a man is to checked\nfor selling hosiery as pure wool or\npure silk, when it really is not, any\nother man who purports to sell a\nsuit as pure wool, or a shire as pure\nsilk, when ii really isn\'t falls under\nthe same ban and is subject to prose,\ncutlon And a man who undertakes\nto sell any goods by misrepresenting\ntheir contents or character is sub\nject undoubtedly to the operation\nof the game law, and there Is do\ndoubt that hereafter dissatisfied pur\nchasers will take advantage of its\nprovisions. The result will be that\nhereafter the purchaser of any ar\nticle will at lust have- the satisfac\ntion of knowing that he is getting\nexactly what he paid for. The sig\nnificance of this ruling can hardly\nbe overestimated and there Is no\ndoubt in the world that it has car\nried dismay and consternation into\nthousands of factories which hereto\nfore have been mabmoozling the\npublic and taking profits to which \'\nthey were not entitled. When the\nsupreme court acts as it has acted 1\nin this matter, there seems to be\nemail need of appealing to congress\nfor a relief which Is already af-1\nforded under the court\'s Judgment.\nCHINA WAR SITUATION\nHELPS SILVER\nBecause of exceptional demanda\nthis week from both China and India\nforeign origin silver advanced to ;\n35 H at London and 70 to 704 cental\nNew York.

Offices are to be\nestablished on the Pacific coast and\nin the middle west so thai the long\ntrip across the continent may be\nobviated and much time saved to\nthe taxpayers It is hoped that the\nnew system will eventually bring up\nto date the work of auditing the in\ncome tax returns, now some three\nyears behind, and bring quick ad\njustment to claims for refunds To\nexpedite the work of federal tax col\nlecting, Mr. Mellon has appointed a tax\nsimplification board, composed of\ntwo representatives of the public\nand three of the bureau, which Is\nworking out various means of facili\ntating the collection of taxes.\nBOOSTING THE TRADE\nConcrete evidence of \' the steady\ngrowth of American exports is fur\nnished in the columns of the weekly\n"Commerce Reports," published by\nthe bureau of foreign and domestic\ncommerce.

Secretary Mellon\'s investi\ngation reveals that Ford collected\nfull price for all articles manufac\ntured for the government.
