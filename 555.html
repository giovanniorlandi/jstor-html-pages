        <pre>['GUEST EDITORIAL\n834       September 2016, Vol. 106, No. 9\nThe recent tragic and widely publicised death \nof South African (SA) celebrity Gugu Zulu \non Mount Kilimanjaro has drawn significant \npublic interest and speculation about the \nrisks of high-altitude trekking and climbing.[1]\nIt has also demonstrated numerous \nmyths and misconceptions with regard to \nsafe high-altitude ascents among not only \nthe lay public, but also medical professionals. \nKilimanjaro is of particular relevance, as it \nhas a very high incidence of altitude-related \nillnesses.[2-5] Regardless of the details of the \nZulu tragedy, a great number of southern \nAfricans undertake treks on Kilimanjaro each \nyear. We have a responsibility to improve \nunderstanding and access to medically sound \nadvice for prospective adventurers, and to \nencourage tour operators to plan and market \nadventure activities that mitigate the risks to \nparticipants.\nWhile the proportional composition of the \natmosphere remains remarkably consistent, \nambient pressure decreases logarithmically \nwith ascent, causing a corresponding decrease \nin the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2).[6] \nThe physiological effects of altitude are \npredomi nantly due to the resultant hypoxia \nand hypo baria. High altitude is defined as \n>1 500 m above sea level, where the physio\nlogical effects of altitude may first be \nconsistently observed, but pathological \nconsequences are very rare.[7] At this level, \nthe alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2) \nis ~10 kPa, compared with the sea level value \nof 13 kPa. It is worth noting that large areas \nof SA, including the extensive metropolitan \nareas in Gauteng, therefore qualify as highaltitude\nareas. Above 3 500 m is referred to \nas very high altitude, above which immediate \ncompensatory mechanisms no longer suffice, \nacclimatisation over time is required, and the \nincidence of acute high-altitude illness (HAI) \ndue to rapid ascent increases dramatically. This \ncan include the syndrome complex known \nas acute mountain sickness (AMS), or the \nmore severe and life-threatening conditions, \nhigh-altitude cerebral or pulmonary oedema \n(HACE or HAPE). While uncommon, cases \nhave occurred in the Drakensberg mountains \n(authors’ experience). Altitudes >5 500 m are \nreferred to as extreme altitudes. Exposure to \nthese levels without gradual acclimatisation \nwill almost certainly result in severe illness.[8] \nAt the top of Kilimanjaro (5 895 m, barometric \npressure ~47 kPa), atmospheric air has a \nPO2 of only 9.4 kPa and the alveolar gas \nequation predicts that even with maximal \nhyperventilation and hypocarbia, the PAO2 can \nonly approach 6 kPa (Fig. 1). This is less \nthan half of the sea level value, despite adequate\nacclimatisation. Values <3 kPa have been \nrecorded in healthy climbers on Everest.[9]\nThe only reliable preventive measure to \ncombat HAI is a slow rate of ascent to altitude, \nallowing adequate time for physiological \nacclimatisation. While most healthy individuals\ncan acclimatise up to 5 500 m, HAI \ncan be induced in any individual if the rate \nof ascent is sufficiently rapid. Contrary to \ncommon beliefs, youth, physical and aerobic \nfitness, gender and previous ascent to high \naltitudes offer no protection.[7] Medications \nsuch as acetazolamide (Diamox) may hasten \nacclimatisation, but still require a suitably slow \nascent profile to have a protective effect.[3]\nNumerous evidence- and consensus-based \nguidelines for safe ascent rates and acclimatisation\nexist,[8,10,11] but are not uniformly applied.[5] \nTypically, above 3 500 m, an increase in sleeping\naltitude of ≤500 m/day is recommended, \nwith a rest day for each 3 - 4 days’ climb. The \nold climber’s adage ‘climb high, sleep low’ \nmay confer an advantage, but this has not \nbeen proven in the literature. While most \nof the world’s highest peaks lie deep within \nwilderness areas and require a lengthy trek \nto reach (and therefore time for acclimatisation),\nKilimanjaro is a particularly important \nexception. As the world’s highest free-standing\nmountain, it allows rapid ascent from the \nsurrounding lowlands (<700 m). Conversely, \nthe absence of requirement for technical \nclimbing skills to gain the 5 895 m summit, \ncombined with the allure of one of the Seven \nSummits, draws >30 000 aspirant summiteers \nevery year – many of whom have never before \nexperienced extreme altitudes. While the \ntrekking distances required make reaching \nthe summit in 3 - 4 days easily achievable, \nacclimatising to nearly 6 km above sea level \ncannot occur in such a short time. Itineraries \nof 4 - 5 days have rates of AMS >75%,[4] while \nRecognising and mitigating the risk of altitude-related illness\nJohannesburg\n1 760 m\n1 000\n9 000\n8 000\n7 000\n6 000\n5 000\n4 000\n3 000\n2 000\nSea level\n8 848 m\nTable Mountain\n1 084 m\nDrakensberg\n3 000 m\n3 482 m\nThabana Ntlenyana\nMont Blanc\n4 808 m\nAconcagua\n6 961 m\n5 895 m\nKilimanjaro\nEx\ntr\nem\ne \nal\ntit\nud\ne\nVe\nry\n h\nig\nh \nal\ntit\nud\ne\nH\nig\nh \nal\ntit\nud\ne\nMetres\nabove\nsea level\nAlveolar\npartial\npressure of\noxygen (kPa)\nMinimum\nascent\nrate (days)\n30\n10\n7\n2\n2\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n10\n11\n13\n3\nEverest\nFig. 1. Relative heights of well-known African and international peaks in comparison to Kilimanjaro, \nwith approximate PAO2 values and minimum duration of safe ascents (drawing by the authors, PAO2 \nvalues calculated).\n', 'HACE incidence has been reported as 18%.[2] Indeed, consensus \nstatements in the wilderness medical literature indicate that ascents \nof <7 days carry very high risks.[10] In contrast to this lies the commercial\nimperative: every day on Kilimanjaro incurs additional guid-\ning, porter, camping, national park and rescue fees, all of which create \na perverse incentive to hurry, imposed by the almighty dollar. This is \nfurther compounded by the pressure placed on the guides by companies\nand climbers alike, for whom summit success is paramount.\nIt is important to recognise that AMS symptoms are nonspecific \n(headache, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue and \npoor sleep) and mimic common conditions such as influenza.[12] \nHAI is very rare below 2 500 m, but any new symptoms occurring \nafter ascent above 3 500 m should be presumed to be altitude \nrelated until proven otherwise. Mild AMS can be managed \nby temporarily halting ascent, simple analgesia and hydration. \nModerate to severe AMS (or any evidence of HACE or HAPE) \nshould result in immediate descent until symptoms subside. \nAdherence to these simple guidelines should minimise the risk of \nan altitude-induced death.\nMountaineers on expeditions on remote peaks traditionally \nmake provision for the risk of altitude illness by allowing time for \nacclimatisation, and carrying suitable supplies for treatment if such \nillness should occur. While medication and descent are the mainstay \nof altitude illness, supportive therapy with supplemental oxygen and \nportable hyperbaric chambers can be lifesaving, especially in cases \nwhere descent is delayed or impossible owing to weather or logistical \ndifficulties. Despite the relative accessibility of Kilimanjaro, and while \nmany tour operators claim to offer their services, the varying level \nof medical skills and number of groups spread across the mountain \nmake availability questionable. Reliance on helicopter rescue in this \nregion, even without the limits of altitude, weather, and darkness, is \ninadvisable.\nHistorically, mountaineering expeditions have been medically \nsupported by recreational mountaineers who are doctors and \nwho may have very varied backgrounds and medical skills. In \nrecent times, however, the importance of providing high-quality, \nevidence-based practice in wilderness, remote and austere settings \nhas driven the development and rapid growth of the disciplines \nand formal education in wilderness, expedition and extreme \nmedicine.[13] Examples include the Fellowship of the Academy \nof Wilderness Medicine (FAWM)[14] under the auspices of the \nWilderness Medical Society (WMS), and the Diploma in Mountain \nMedicine (DiMM),[15] under the auspices of the International \nClimbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA). As practice \nhas evolved, published standards for the education, skills and \nproficiencies of expedition medics have emerged.[16,17] Until very \nrecently, these educational opportunities have not been available \nin SA. Currently, however, internationally accredited training \ncourses are being offered, and a Wilderness and Expedition \nMedicine Society of Southern Africa (WEMSSA) has been formed.\nOwing to the accessibility and popularity of climbing Kilimanjaro \nand other African peaks, practitioners should recognise the significant \nrisks of very high altitude ascents and refer participants to accepted \nguidelines and expedition or altitude experts. Doctors wishing to \nserve as expedition medics should undertake formal training and \nobtain experience in the field, whether their role is voluntary or for \nremuneration. Large or specialist groups (such as charity events) are \nencouraged to request the services of an experienced and qualified \nexpedition doctor, who can oversee planning, screening, equipment \nand the health of participants on the expedition. Finally, the medical \nfraternity should continue to advocate that individuals do not shy \nfrom the health benefits to be \ngained from the wilderness, while \npromoting adequate acclimatisation \nfor high-altitude adventures and \nactively campaigning against \nitineraries placing participants at \nheightened risk.\nRoss Hofmeyr\nDepartment of Anaesthesia and \nPerioperative Medicine, Faculty of \nHealth Sciences, University of Cape \nTown; and WildMedix, Cape Town, \nSouth Africa \nWalther Meyer\nWildMedix, and Venture Forth International, Cape Town, South Africa\nMike James\nDepartment of Anaesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Faculty of \nHealth Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa\nRik De Decker\nDivision of Paediatric Cardiology, University of Cape Town, and Red \nCross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa; \nand International Commission for Alpine Rescue, Kloten, Switzerland\nCorresponding author: R Hofmeyr (ross.hofmeyr@uct.ac.za)\n1.
