A large\nproportion of this loss may be\nprevented if farmers, gardeners\nand truckers will take the trou\nble to collect or in some way de\nstroy the bugs that first appear\nthis spring. We have conclusive\nevidence that such work may be\nmade a paying investment. We\ncannot, however, continue to\nwait, as is usually done until the\nbugs become so numerous as to\ncause very noticeable injury in\ngardens or fields, but on the con\ntrary they must be destroyed be\nfore they commence to lay eggs;\notherwise the annual loss will\nremain the same or will increase.\n"In November last this station\npublished a press bulletin urging\nfarmers to immediately collect\nand kill the terrapin bugs, then\nin their fields, to prevent their\nliving in such numbers through\nthe winter. Now it seems ad\nvisable to urge the equally\nimportant work of destroying\nthose individuals that escaped\nlast fall, and which will soon\ncommence to come out from their\nwinter hiding quarters.\nEggs and young bugs do not\nlive through the winter in this\nState; hence it is only full-grown,\nstrong, adult males and females\nwhich survive by finding favor\nable hibernating quarters under\nrubbish around the gardens,\nunder stones, in fence corners\nand similar places, where they\nare protected from the weather.\nAs this has been a mild winter,\nthey are liable to appear in\ngreater numbers than usual in\nthe spring.\n"We could not consistently\nurge the task of destroying the\nover wintering bugs if they com\nmenced to lay eggs upon their\nfirst appearance. Careful ob\nservation has shown that at least\ntwo weeks\' time elapses -after\nthe bugs appear before the first\neggs are deposited. During this\nperiod frey are very actively\needing and mating, and the\nmajority will congregate on the\new old plants left from last\nseason\'s crop. Wild mustard\nand turnips are favorite food\nplants, and collards, with their\nbroad leaves, often harbor a\narge number of them.\nThe prime object of this ar\nticle is to emphasize the fact\nthat the farmer or gardener who\nwatches closely for the first ter\nrapin bugs to appear has about\ntwo weeks\' time to kill them and\nstill prevent the majority from\nlaying eggs for the first genera\ntion.\nHave you ever considered the\nactual benefit that results from\nkilling one female terrapin bug\nwhen she first appears in spring?\nObserve the following state\nments: The average number of\neggs laid by each bug varies\nfrom eighty-four to ninety-six\nthat is, seven or eight masses of\ntwelve eggs each, deposited over\na period of from four to eight\nweeks. There are three full\ngenerations each year. Suppose\nwe kill a single terrapin bug and\nthus prevent ninety-six young\nfor the first generation, of which\none-half might be females. If\nthese forty-eight females repro\nduced at the same rate, the sec\nond generation would number\n4,608 individuals. Counting only\none-half as females, each capa\nble of producing ninety-six\nyoung, the third generation\nwould reach the enormous num\nber of 221,184, the progeny of\none female in a single year. We\ncan divide this number by one\nhundred and still have over 2,\n200 as the number of bugs pre\nvented by killing one individ\nual when she first appears.\nDuring the warm summer\nmonths a minute pararite in the\nform of a tiny black fly destroys\na large percentage of the eggs,\nbut as a general thing these\nparasites do not become abun\ndant until the hrst generation is\nwell developed; so that the de\nstruction of the bugs thPt pro\nduce the first generation is more\nessential than the death of bugs\nlater in the year. Another point\nin favor of early destruction!\n"Are not the above facts suf\nficient to impress farmers with\nthe importance of spring de\nstruction of terrapin bugs? .\n"Hand Picking.

Carlyle\'s\narticle in The Robesonian on clay\nroads and am surprised to hear\nhim claim that the clay roads are\nnot a success if properly con\nstructed. It is, I think, a matter\nof history that Caesar in travers\ning the country \'on either side of\nthe Rubicon built the sand clay\nroads that are there till the pres\nent day.\nSeveral years ago, when the\nclay roads were first being built\nin Robeson county, in the days\nwhen Mr. Allen was supennten\ndent of public roads for Robeson\ncounty, I was supervisor for my\ntownship Red Springs. In this\ntownship we had one of the\nworst sandy roads I reckon could\nbe found m Robeson county.\nThis was the public road leading\nfrom Antioch to Red Springs,\nOn this road there was a sand\nbed about one mile in length. We\ngraded this road, then put about\neight inches of clay on it with five\nInches of sand on this. Since\nthat time several years ago the\nrains have descended and the\nfloods have come and the road is\nstill here, not cracked, as\nsavs. nor cut. either, and 1 re\nmark that it has required prac\ntically no work since it was built.\nIt is a fact that the sand clay\nroads, if properly built, are the\nsalvation of Robeson county,\nE.

In\nThe Dillon (S. C.) Herald of the1\n11th there is a story of a column !\nin length about Chas. Ivey and\nthe unfortunate runaway of his\nteam in East Lumberton which\nresulted in the death of one child\nand the injury of two others, one\nof them seriously, and after giv\ning one version of the killing of\none of the children it winds up\nthe story with the startling as\nsertion that another child "ling\nered in agony three davs and\nthen died". The story further\nsays thaf\'Ivey was promptly ar\nrested on the charge of criminal\ncarelessness" and that "now he\nlanguishes in jail a victim of the\nrates". In the headlines it is\nstaled that the particular jail he\nlanguishes in is in Lumberton.\nWhich is news.\nThe correct story of that run\naway was told in TheRobesonian\nat the time. As a matter of fact\none child died as the result of\nthat distressing runaway, and\ni. L. A 1- 1 1 1 . 1 .\ntne inner ennu mat was serious\nly injured is improving. And if\nIvey was arrested it was not by\nauthorities here at least not for\nthat offense and he certainly\ndoes not languish in the jail here\nlhe last part of the story about\nIvey is interesting. It runs as\nfollows:\nCharlie Ivey, who formerly\nran a livery stable at Dillon, but\nmoved to Lumberton some weeks\nago to engage in a similar busi\nness, seems to be pursued by a\nrelentless Fate. Before moving\nto Dillon he was engaged in the\nlivery business at McColl. He\nleft McColl because he believed\nthe Fates were against him. While\nthere several of his horses died;\nhe suffered financial loss from\nrun-a-ways and everywhere he\nturned he found "bad-luck"\nawaiting him in the middle of\nthe road. He moved to Dillon\nbecause he thought a change\nwould alter the current of his\nlife. But in this he was mistak\nen. Bad luck pursued him and\nPERSONAL.\nThe Teachers Meeting a Suc\ncess.\nnere n aeait witn mm as severe\nly as ever.
