I\nu\n-11\nfiisDear Cittle Girl.\nThat was what Terence Dawnay\nhad always called her, ever since\nthey had met and loved each other.\nHe was in Ireland now with his\nregiment, but he wrote very regular\nly to his dear little girl, and though\nthere was no question of any for\nmal engagement between them, he\nhad assured her that their under\nstanding was as sacred a bond to\nhim as any public betrothal, and of\ncourse she believed him—tor she\nwas young, and she loved him.\nShe was thinking ot him as she\nwalked down the path to meet the\npostman ;this was her letter day,\nand Irish letters always came by\nthe midday mail to the Devonshire\nvillage, where she lived within sight\nand sound ot the moaning sea.\nIt was late in June, and the Sum\nmer wind tossed her pretty hair\nagainst the cheeks, which were soft\nand Hushed like a peach. The post\nman was coming up the hill; a smile\ncrossed his weather-beaten face as\nhe caught sight ot the waiting figure.\n“Two letters, missy, this morning,”\nhe said, as he sorted them from his\nbundle ; “that’s all, miss.”\nI wo letters:\nSlie went out on the cliff side with\nthem ; one was, of course, from Ter\nence ; how well she knew his dear,\nuntidy writing! She smiled as she\nput it in her pocket; that must be\nkept as a bonne bouche.\nThe other one was in quite strange\nhandwriting, and she tire it open,\nlooking at its contents with bewilder\nment. A blank sheet of paper en\nclosing a small newspaper cutting\nmet her eyes. What could it mean?\nThe color laded from her cheeks.\n“We understand that an interest\ning engagement will be announced\nbefore the end of the Summer, and\nwe may safely offer our good wishes\nto the beauty of the year, Miss Sar\ngeant, at the same time congratulat\ning the gallant 6ance on his luck.\nMr. Dawnay is well known in Dub\nlin, where his regiment is at present\nquartered."\nThe little bit of paper tell to the\nground. Ot course it was not true!\nSomeone was trying to make mis\nchief between them. That was all.\nWhy, he washers—he had been hers\nfrom the very first day that they\nhad met! The newspaper did not\nknow what it was talking about;\nshe eyed the envelope with disgust;\nwho had done this thing? And who\nwas Miss Sargeant? Terence had\nnever mentioned her.\nShe pulled his letter out of her\npocket and opened it, reading it with\na sudden chill, which quenched the\nhappiness in her pretty eyes.\n"My Dear Little Girl—I have hard\nly a moment for a letter, so I am\nafraid this will be very short, but\nthere is so much to be done here just\nnow, what, with pxilo and goodness\nknows what else besides, that 1 have\nenough to do to get everything done\nin the day. I’m going down to stay\nnear Cork next week with some\npeople called Sargeant—jolly house\nand no end ot gayeties, ot course; 1\nwish" (there something had been\nscratched out) "I could have man\naged to run over to you, dear, but it\nis quite impossible. You see, there\nure our maneuvers coming on, and I\nmust be within easy reach ot head\nquarters. I don’t know that there is\nanything ot interest to tell you. 1\nhave been thinking lately that it\'s a\nbit rough on you to be kept hanging\noil lor such an interminable time—\nnot that I\'ve altered, you know that\n—but,you see, tilings are not looking\nvery bright tor us, are they? It’s\nawfully late, I must stop. Good\nnight, dear little girl. Kver yours,\n“TKKKNCK.”\nThe sun was hidden by a thick\ncloud, the sea moaned on the rocks\nbelow, and a light wind ruffled the\nwaves. It looked like a change in\nthe weather. But the girl did not\nnotice the signs ot change. Her eyes\nwere fixed unseeingly on the letter\nin her hand. She stooped and pick\ned up the little paper, which she\nhad allowed to flutter to the ground\nunheeded. No need to read it again.\nIt was imprinted on her memory tor\nall time. She wondered what there\nwas for her to do. Must it be re\nnunieation?\nThat was a question to be answer\ned at onee, and before she turned her\nsteps homeward she had made her\nresolve.\n• « • • * • «\n“Our dance, Miss Sargeant.”\nThe girl looked up.\n“Is it? No; I don’t want to dance.\nDo you mind if we sit it out?\'\'\n“Do I mind?" repeated Dawnay,\nwith a look in his blue eyes which\nonly amused the beautiful Miss\nSargeant. She had seen that look so\noften that it made little or no im\npression on her. Had she not danced\nand flirted through some dozen sea\nsons and received more than her\nshare of attention? Of course, Ter\nence was a nice, dear boy, but as to\nanything else—she laughed at the\nmere idea. She was striving for a\nhigher destiny than that, in spite of\nall the society papers and their\nrumors.\nDawnay looked at her as she lay\nback in a low chair waving a great\nfeather fan to and fro. He believed\nin her thoroughly. He believed that\nhere was the lady of his dreams.\n"Have you any more dances to\nspare me?” he pleaded. “I know I\nwas late, but that was not my fault.”\n“Not one left,” she said indifferent\nly\nShe talked to him in her low, sweet\nvoice, and he was quite content to\nsit in the cool shadow and listen to\nher.\n"And when do you go on leave?”\nshe said, lazily.\n•‘That,” he said, steadily, “entirely\ndepends on circumstances.”\n“Meaning the little girl you left in\nDevonshire?” she said with a mock\ning smile. “Oh, I know all about\nher! Lord Carruthers—you know\nhim?—told me he knew her people.”\n“I don’t know what you mean?"\nhe said, hotly. “There is but one\nwoman in the world for me. and\nshe-”\nHe broke off. A couple were pass\ning their retreat, talking in light,\nlaughing tones.\n“Rhoda Sargeant? Oh, she will\nend by marrying Carruthers, ot\ncourse. She is only playing her\nusual little game with that nice boy,\nDawnay. She might spare such a\nyoungster. That sort of woman has\ndo mercy-”\nThe voices trailed away into si\nlence.\n“You heard that?” said Dawnay in\nhoarse accents; “but it is not true?\nIt can’t be true that you have been\nplaying with me all these weeks?"\nThe woman looked at him lor a\nmoment. Some good angel, a rare\nenough visitor to her, urged her to\ntell the truth for once. She did so\nwith a curious feeling of pity. The\nboy was in such earnest.\n"It is quite true.”\nDawnay staggered to his feet.\nFor a few terrible minutes he look\ned at her in silence—a silence which\nfrightened her.\n“Then Heaven help the man who\nloves you!’ he said, and turned and\nleft her.\nTerence Hawnay sat in his quar\nters with his head buried in his\narms; the cool dawn crept in\nthrough the windows on the motion\nless figure; for hours after his re\nturn from the ball he had not moved.\nPresently he raised his head and\nlooked about him with haggard\neyes; he got up stiffly and drew a\nlong breath.\nHis infatuation was dead. He had\ncalled it love in his youthful igno\nrance, but the bewildering light of\ntruth had dispelled that idea forever.\nWhat a tool he had been! He stood\nfor a moment looking out on the still,\ngray morning, and, with a sudden\nflood of remorse, remembered the\nletter to which there had been no\nanswer; the letter which in a mo\nment of his blind infatuation he had\nwritten to his dear little girl. He\nloved her—loved her. Hear Heaven!\nhad he thrown away the substance\nonly to find himself striving to grasp\na shadow?\nWhy had she never written to\nhim? Had she given him up with\nout a word, without even a strug\ngle?\nThe thought paralyzed him.\nTruly he was to be sorely punish\ned for his madness.\nHis eyes fell on a revolver hang\ning against the wall. But he turned\naway with a grim smile; he was not\nthe sort to run away from trouble\nwhen he found himself face to face\nwith it. He was no coward, at least.\nThen, with an exclamation, he\nseized a letter which was stuck up\non the mantleshelf—probably put\nthere by his servant on the previous\nevening.\nIt was a letter from his dear little\ngirl after all! For a minute or two\nhe hardly dared open it; then he tore\nit open, and read its short contents\nwith eager eyes.\n“I should have written to you be\nfore now, my dearest—for you are\nalways that—only I have been very\nill, and am only now up on the sofa,\nand can only write you these few\nlines to say that I love—dear; I love\nyou so much that I must do what\nseems to me the only thing left for\nme to do, and that is to give you\nyour freedom. I don’t blame you,\ndear—I shall never think badly of\nyou. Always, believe that I love\nyou better than anything on earth.\nI sign myself for the last time, Your\nDear Little Girl.”\nTwice he read the little heart\nbroken letter. A knock on his door\nawoke him from his miserable\nthoughts with a start.\n“Eight o’clock, sir,” said his serv\nant\'s voice.\n“Come in, Stevens,” he shouted, as\na sudden idea flashed upon him.\n“Put some things up in my bag. I\nmay be away for a day or two, and\njust get my serge out, will you?\nHe was still in his mess dress, but\nhis man paid no attention to that; in\na tew minutes he was in his usual\nundress uniform and striding over\nto the Colonel\'s quarters.\nObtaining three day’s leave he was\nable to catch the night mail from\nKingstown to Holyhead, and the\nnext afternoon saw his arrival at\nthe little house where his dear little\ngirl had struggled back to the plain\nof life, which at present seemed\nshorn of all its gladness.\nHe walked straight in; there was\nno one to be seen, and opening the\ndoor gently stole into the room\nwhere his dear little girl was lying\nlooking out at the distant blue sea,\nwith such sad, tired eyes.\nShe looked around as she heard\nthe door shut, and a cry burst from\nher lips—a cry which brought Ter\nence to her side, and the next minute\nhe was down on his knees, holding\nher to his heart, and kissing the\ncheeks which had grown so thin and\npale.\n“My sweet," he cried, “only tell\nme that you forgive me! Oh, darl\ning, I have been nearly mad since I\nwrote that letter to you! Can you\never\'forget and take it back? You\nshall know all, dearest, only tell me\nthat you love me, first.”\n"That is such a very stale story,”\nshe whispered faintly, with a smile\nwhich told him that the gates of\nEden had opened to him once again.\nA Modern fable.\nA young woman in New York\nwent to one of the large dry goods\nstores one tine day and bought sev\neral articles, tendering in payment,\nas she supposed, the exact amount\nshe owed. Two days later she was\nsurprised to get a letter inclosing\nthe firm’scheck for $i. It seems that\nshe had given the salesman one bill\ntoo many. She told her husband of\nthis incident when he came home\nthat night. Next day she told her\nsister, her brother and her sister-in\nlaw. Her dearest friends to the\nnumber of fourscore knew within a\nweek that every one was treated\nwith scrupulous honesty at this\nparticular store.

While one of the\nabove-named papers thinks the\nSilver Party is still the dominant\nparty in the State, the other two\nare not so sure of it, and urge that\nthe Silver Party must fuse to help\nthe Democrats win. The fact of\nthe matter is they all favor any\nold kind of trust that can be con\ncocted to defeat what they term the\n“common enemy”—the Republi\ncan party. The Silver Party only\nlives to-day as an adjunct to the\nDemocratic Party, the principle\nwhich it was organized to cnam\npion is a dead one, and the only\nuse anyone can possibly have for\nit is to further prostitute it to De\nmocracy. There may be no shame\nor disgrace in this, viewed from a\ncertain standpoint, but to those\nwhose idol has fallen beyond re\ncall it is useless to try and con\nvince them that the next best\ncourse is to take up with a jade.\nWe do not know, brethren,\nwhether it will make any differ\nence to you or to us whether the\nSilver Party is dead or alive, or\nwhether the Democratic or Re\npublican party wins. In neither\ncase will we have free toinage of\nsilver, and that, we believe, was\nwhat we started out to accomplish;\nbut somehow we were switched\noff, and the election of a United\nStates Senator and a Congressman\nbecame of more importance than\nthe silver issue.\nOur esteemed (we mean this\nword to be taken in its full sense)\ncontemporaries can juggle with\nthe corpse of the Silver Party un\ntil next election if they choose to,\nand then they may set it up as\na side-show to Democracy. The\nclowns may crack their whips and\nthe buffoons their ribald jokes\nabout free coinage, but if we mis\ntack not the tents will not be\ncrowded to see the show.\nThe Ohio Democrats, some of\nthem, are not satisfied with the\nplatform adopted at the late State\nConvention, and another con\nvention is to be held the latter\npart of this month by what is term\ned the Bryan faction of the De\nmocracy. The late Democratic\nConvention said nothing about\nfree coinage of silver and some\nother things that the Bryanites\nthink should have been mention\ned. This only goes to prove that\nthe Democratic Party is but little,\nif any, more favorable to free coin\nage than the Republican Party.\nIt has been demonstrated that no\nman who holds Bryan’s views in\nregard to silver can be elected\nPresident, and it is a forgone con\nelusion that the Democrats will\nnot put up a silver man for that\nposition in 1904. As the Republi\ncans are completely committed to\nthe gold standard, it is hard to\nunderstand how silver is going to\nbe recognized in any party as an\nissue in the next Presidential cam\npaign. Even those Democrats\nwho favor free coinage know that\nto declare for it will defeat them.\nIt may be expected that other\nState Conventions will follow the\nlead of the Ohioians, and this will\nmean dissatisfaction and discon\ntent all along the line. If the\ngold Democrats cannot control the\nparty they will knife it, as they\nalways have done, by voting for a\nRepublican, and there will be\nmore of them in 1904 than there\never has been before. The only\nhope for silver is that the gold\nsupply will run short, or that the\ndemand for money will be so great\nthat silver will have to be used, as\nformerly. The situation is bad,\nnot only for the silver producing\nStates, but for the entire country,\nwe believe, but the Democratic\nPartv will never readjust the mat\nter for years to come.\nThe great strikes that are now\non throughout the country indicate\nthat labor and capital are not yet\non a thoroughly business footing.\nThere is certainly something\nwrong with the laws of the count\nry when a few men are allowed to\nbecome billionaires and the mass\nof laboring men are not paid suf\nficient wages to decently support\ntheir families, let alone owning\ncomfortable homes for them. Men\nhave a right to make as much\nmoney as they can, but this right\nshould not be legally extended so\nthat capital can trample labor un\nderfoot. The country is large\nenough and work is sufficiently\nplentiful to allow each person a\nposition at fair wages. The demand\nfor our manufactures is so great\nthat they sell at top prices, and\nwhen the man of means is allowed\nto make exhorbitant profits on his\ngoods w hile the laborer barely ex\nists, there is something radically\nwrong about the system. This is\na matter that the Republican Party\nmust not overlook if it desires to\nkeep close to the people and con\ntinue in power to do good in other\nways. _\nThe case of Postmaster Snyder,\naf Tuscarora, is a strange one.\nSome weeks ago he was arrested\nand thrown into jail on a charge\naf being short in his accounts some\nf20oo. It now transpires, after a\nfull investigation, that the govern\nment owes Snyder $29. Evident\nly he has a case against somebody\nfor false imprisonment and dam\nages. Possibly some of Snyders\n‘warm friends” in ElkoCounty are\nat the bottom of all the trouble.\nHon. Charles A. Towne said\nn New York this week that the\niilver issue is dead in the East and\n:hat Wm. J.

His\nteams and wagonsare as good, if not\nbetter than any in the State, and the\nwagons are built expressly tor haul\ning in a sandy country, the wheels\nhaving large eight-inch tires. Such\nwagons as these are a benefit to a\ngood road rather than a detriment,\nas they never cut a road up after it\nis once properly put in shape. The\nroad between Wahuska and Yering\nton, however, has been too tough a\none lor Alkali Hill to travel, and he\nhas concluded to take olf his teams,\nas the cost of repairs and the wear\nand tear on stock was too great to\nallow a fair margin of profit at the\nrates now being paid tor hauling.\nT» the Deaf.\nA rich lady cured of deafness and\nnoises in the head by Dr. Nicholson\'s\nArtificial Knr Drums, gave $lo,ooo\nto his Institute, so that deaf people\nunahle to procure the Kar Drums\nmay have them free.

The company is now building\na station on the road, just north of\nMcLeod’s place, with corrals, etc.,\ntor keeping stock.\nThis signature is on every box of tbn genuine\nLaxative Bromo-Quinine Tablets\ntbe remedy that curve a cold In one day\nThe llfard Mine.\nThe Lizard mine, situated near\nCooney Springs, about twelve miles\nnortheast of this place, now has a\nshaft down one hundred feet and a\ndrift is being run on the ledge. A\nfair sized body of ore has been un\ncovered and samples of the ore sent\nto Selby & Co. give returns that are\nvery encouraging.\nNeed a Road.\nMason Valley needs a road be\ntween Wabuska and Yerington.\nThere is a right of way between\nthese two points, but what is called\nthe road is in such a condition that\nit is impassable for large teams.\nDuring the past year many large\nteams have been hauling freight\nover this road from the railroad to\nYerington and the mines. The road\nruns through a sandy, loamy coun\ntry, most of the way, and heavy\nwagons cut it up badly in the dry\nseason, while in the wet season, or\nwhen water is allowed to run in the\nroad, heavy teams mire down.\nThere has been considerable money\nspent on this road in years past,\nprobably enough, if put all together,\nto have constructed a good road ; but\nit has been spent in driblets, and the\nroad, to-day, is no better than it no\nmoney had been expended lor re\npairs. What is necessary to con\nstruct a good and lasting road over\nthis right of way, is to have the\nground thrown up in the center and\nrock hauled onto it to ballast it. On\ntop of this finer rock should be haul\ned and rolled down, and then team\nsters should be required to use wider\ntires on their wagons. To make\nsuch a road it would cost several\nthousand dollars, but when once\nconstructed it would last forever\nwith a slight expense each year lor\nrepairs. Men ot means are going in\nto Mason Valley and investing their\nmoney, thereby making more tax\nable property in the county, and it\nwould seem that the least the resi\ndents ot the county could do would\nbe to construct good roads to assist\nin the building up of the county.\nIt the people ot this county want to\nmeet men who come here to invest\ntheir money halt-way. they can\nshow this disposition in no plainer\nmanner than bv giving them good\nroads over which to haul their\nmoney into the country.\nLook Out For Him.\nJust as we were locking up our\nlast form last night a communica\ntion was received from Nason Val\nley warning mine owners to beware\nof a man named Hall, who is travel\ning about the country pretending to\nrepresent the Standard Oil Compa\nny. Hall isot medium height, heavy\nset, hazel eyes, set widely apart,\nupturned nose, iron gray hair and\nmoustache and bald on top ot head.\nHe put many prospect owners in the\nvalley to considerable trouble and\nexpense, agreed to buy everything\nin sight and pay cash tor same on\nthe 17th ot this month. Instead he\nlett Yerington without paying his\nboard bill.\nHall landed in Dayton Thursday\ntrom Wabuska on toot and took the\ntrain from here to the Mound House\nthat atternoon. Mine owners are\ncautioned against having dealings\nwith him.\nIt Dazzles the World.\nNo Discovery in medicine has ever\ncreated one quarter of the excite\nment that has been caused by Dr.\nKing’s New’ Discovery tor Con\nsumption.

Flaws.\nA field for farm Produce.\nThe Tonopah paper, in each issue\nfor a few weeks past, has complain\ned of a scarcity of farm and garden\nproduction in that camp, and now it\nsays there are no "spuds” in camp.\nWhile the camp ot Tonapah is quite\na distance from Mason Valley a rail\nroad connects the two points with\nthe exception of a distance of sixty\nmiles—from Sodaville to Tonapah—\nand it seems that farm and dairy\nproducts of all kinds could be sup\nplied at fair prices by the ranchers\nol the valley to the miners ot Tono\npah. Hay, grain, potatoes, onions,\nhoney, butter, cheese, etc., arc to be\nproduced in Mason Valley in unlim\nited quantity, and as the new min\ning camp to the south is bound to\nconsume great quantities of these\nproducts, it would seem that the\nmarket would be well worth looking\nalter.\nIt is true that the mining industry\nin and about Mason Valley is creat\ning a demand for considerable farm\nproduce, but there is plenty of land\nand water with which to raise more\nthan enough tor home consumption.\nIt may be that there are other agri\ncultural points a trifle closer to To\nnopah than Mason Valley, but we\ndo not understand that they would\nhave any the best of competing for\nthe trade. One thing we aresure ot,\nthey cannot produce a better quality\not goods.\nNevada\'s Exhibit at Buffalo.\nJ. A. Yerington, the Nevada Com\nmissioner and mining expert, whose\nexhibit is in the mines building and\nhas attracted such general and in\nterested attention, has done much\nlor Nevada, says a late issue of the\nBuffalo, N. Y., Express.\nRecently he exhibited specimens of\nthe Tonopah gold ores, and mining\nmen and capitalists came from far\nand near to see them Now he an\nnounces that the Tonopah mines\nhave been sold for $336,000. The pur\nchasers are mainly from Philadel\nphia. He also states that the McKin\nley interests in the great Chaimnan\nmines have been bought, but he is\nnot at liberty to reveal the identity\nof the buyer.\nAnother item of mining news in\nNevada, which is attributed partly\nto the display at the Pan-American,\nis contained in the announcement\nthat a company with $50,0110,000 cap\nital has been formed to develop the\nVulcan Copper Companys’ interests\nin Ksmeralda county.\nDeafness Cannot be Cured\nby local applications, as they can\nnot reach the diseased portion of the\near. There is only one way to cure\ndeafness, and that is by constitu\ntional remedies. Deafness is caused\nby an inflamed condition of the\nmucous lining of the Eustachian\nTube. When this tube gets inflamed\nyou have a rumbling sound or im\nperfect hearing, and when it is en\ntirely closed deafness is the result,\nand unless the inflammation can be\ntaken out and this tube restored to\nits normal condition, hearing will be\ndestroyed forever; nine cases out of\nten are caused by catarrh, which is\nnothing but an inflamed condition of\nthe mucous surfaces.\nWe will give One Hundred Dollars\nfor any case of Deafness (caused by\ncatarrh) that can not be cured by\nHall\'s Catarrh Cure.

H. Hamilton arrived here\nThursday night accompanied by Mr.\nCunningham, the chemist, and went\nout early the next morning to the\nniter mines.\nIt will be remembered that Prof.\nSmith in company with Mr. Hamil\nton was up here last May and made\nan exhaustive examination of the\nproperty, taking with him a large\nnumber ot samples. Nothing further\nwas to be done until Prof. Smith\nmade his report. The report is now\nin and is very satisfactory, and this\nis the reason of Mr. Hamilton’s pres\nence here at this time.\nMr. Hamilton is here making ar\nrangements tor the erection of a\nleaching plant for working the niter\ndeposits. This plant will be put up\nwithin the next thirty days, and the\nwork has already begun.\nThe water question lor steam and\nother purposes has been solved by\nsinking wells and water enough has\nbeen secured to justify going ahead\nwith the erection of the plant. They\nhave six men at work out there now\nsinking wells.\nThe plant at first will not be very\nlarge. It will be increased in size\nand working capacity, however,\nlrom time to time as the mine justi\nfies doing so.\nHoth Mr. Hamilton and Cunning\nham are highly pleased with the out\nlook and very confident as to the suc\ncess ot the enterprise. Mr. Cunning\nham was here some three years ago\nand made some tests himself. He is\na chemist ot repute, and has never\ndoubted the success of the enterprise\nsince he made his examination at\nthat time.\nMessrs.

Any person who receives a newspaper and\nmakes use of it, whether he has subscribed for it or\nnot, is held in law as a subscriber.\n7. The Postmaster who neglects to give the legal\nnotice of the neglect of a person to take from the of\nfice the newspaper addressed to him is liable to the\npublisher for the subscription price.\nThe Poultry Louse.\n“About 99 per cent, of all the writ\ners on poultry culture laws for be\nginners as well as the older heads\nhave tor years—and, in fact, are still\nhammering at it—insisted that to riel\nout chicken houses, roosts, nests, etc.,\nof lice, mites, red bugs and vermin\nof all kinds, all one has to do is sim\nply saturate houses, etc., with kero\nsene two or three times a month.\nNow, I would not dare controvert so\nmuch able and scientific advice—\nsome of it given honestly to aid a\ntroubled brother, and some of it\nwritten to help fill up some ot these\ncheap poultry books that show how\none can find an easy and rapid road\nto wealth by keeping “a tew hens”—\nbut this I would dare, and that is to\nmake the frank and honest avowal\nthat the lice and mites that have\nhonored my chicken houses with a\nvisit take just as much pleasure in\ntheir weekly swim in kerosene as\ndoes the “gutter snipe” in his hurried\ndip in the river or lake (when the\npoliceman’s back is turned) on a hot\nJuly or August afternoon. As the\nbooks have it, it was a ceaseless war\ntare, with myself on the losing side\nevery time, until one day, many\nyears ago, a lady acquaintance asked\nme it I ever tried crude petroleum.\nI never had, but it did not take me\nlong to procure live gallons of it,\nand with an old discarded paint\nbrush I put a good thick coat on per\nches, nest boxes, cracks and corners,\nand betore I left that chicken house\nevery pest that had come in contact\nwith my pungent-smelling—but at\nthe same time,death to lice—mixture\nwas a dead duck. 1 could never un\nderstand why these men that claim\nto have had years of experience in\npoultry culture always made use ot\nkerosene and never seem to have\nheard ot the virtues of crude petro\nleum. If you are having trouble in\nkeeping the pests in subjection,\nbrother tanciers(and sisters,as well)\njust buy a gallon of the crude oil, or\nif you can not obtain that, residium\nwill answer just as well. One coat\nof either, applied to the infected\nplaces, will last three or four weeks\ntor it does not evaporate ns rapidly\nas the coal oil. Its only objection is\nthat it will make the perches and\nboxes look black or dark-colored, but\nthis detect, if defect you would cal\nit, is more than compensated for in\nthat it does the work thoroughly and\nwell, and you have not got to spend\nthe time, twice a week or such a\nmatter, in going over your houses\nwith kerosene.”\nCas tar painted over every part ot\nthe henhouse on which a louse might\nlodge will put the louse so out of\npatience that he will emigrate.\nNative or Black Bees.\nThe native bees of this country\nhold their own as to their existence\nwell. While for quite a number of\nyears every one engaged in active\nbeekeeping has done everything in\nhis power to completely destroy this\nrace, yet there seems to be plenty of\nthem yet. One would suppose that\nwith the amount ot Italian bees there\nnow are in this country, and the\nchance they have to Italianize the\nnative blacks, that they would be\nvery nearly run out. It seems that\nto give them an equal chance, the\nblacks and the Italians, the blacks\nwould swallow up the whole Italian\nrace and finally reign supreme.\nIf the Italian bee is of a hardier\nrace than the black bees, why would\nthis seem so? We might locate in\nthe most remote place we can find,\nand in localities where no bees ot any\nkind could have possibly made a liv\ning in past years, and one would con\nclude that no black bees could have\nbeen in such places, yet when we\nare sure that every queen we raise\nwill be purely mated, and not a\nhybrid appear to mar our peace, to\nour great disappointment and sur\nprise, the old blood turns up, and in\nquantities to convince us that we\nhave the blacks in our midst. It\nwould look as if the old black bees\nare more tenacious ot life and exist\nence than we have taken them to be.\nThis must either be the case, or else\nthe Italian bees which have been im\nported into this country in great\nnumbers contain a sprinkle ot the\nblack or German blood before com\ning to this country, and they did con\ntain more or less ot it, and degene\nrate rapidly back to the same.\nIt does not seem that wc are very\nsoon to have absolute purity in our\nstock of bees, and it seems to us that\nthere are about as many black bees\nin the country now as there were\nseveral years ago, as it is just as\nhard to keep an apiary clear of them\nnow as it has been for some time\npast. Not a single apiarist breeds\nthem, that we have on record, or\ntries to maintain the stock.—A. H.\nDurr in Farm, Field and Fireside.\nAlfalfa In Nebraska.\nRed Willow county is in the south\nern tier of counties, seventy miles\neast ot Colorado. This is known as\nthe “great alfalfa region." Alfalfa\nyields three to four crops of hay\nevery year, without irrigation, no\nmatter how dry and hot it is. I have\nseen it make tour crops and then pas\nture six weeks in the Fall. The yield\nis four to six tons per acre a year,\nand some years a little more. I have\nhad three tonsper acre at one cutting.\nThis year the first cutting on thirty\nacres made 105 big loads. This field\nwas sown last year. If sown in\nApril, on clean land, it makes two\ncrops that year. It has made three\ncrops the year it was sown. The\nyear 1894 was the worst drought\never known here, and it was cut\nthree and some fields four times that\nyear without irrigation. That year\neight acres kept twenty-two head of\nhorses and cattle all season. Fifteen\nacres made two crops, and from July\n20 kept forty-one head of cattle till\nNovember. I have pastured it in\nLiciooer ana rtovemuer, ana ine cows\ngave about the same quantity of\nmilk, and the butter was as yellow\nas in June on clover. It is the first\nthing to start in Spring, and last to\ndry up in the Fall, I have plowed\ncorn since 1848, and have fed nearly\nall kinds of hay. I like alfalfa best.\nIt does best on bottom land. There\nare over sixty thousand acres of\nrich, level bottom land in the county.\nTwo farms near mine can be had\nnow at $15 per acre, it bought of the\nowners. I have farmed here twenty\nyears, and have not ted stock three\nmonths any Winter, and some Win\nters none. William Coleman.\nIt is expected that California will\nthis year produce between 80,000\nand 100,000 tons ot beet sugar, while\nthe refineries of the State have con\ntracted for 100,000 tons ot Hawaiian\ncane sugar. The productions ot beet\nsugar last year was 35,000 tons, and\nthis year’s output will establish a\nnew record forthe State. The value\not the beet sugar production will be\nbetween $8,000,000 and (10.000,000, and\nit is expected to meet the entire re\nquirements of the coast, leaving the\ncane sugar tor shipment to the mid\ndle west.\nI am a farmer located near Stony Brook, one of the most malarious\ndistricts in this State, and was bothered with malaria for years, at times\nso I could not work, and was always very constipated as well. For\nyears I had malaria so bad in the spring, when engaged in plowing,\nthat I could do nothing but shake. I must have taken about a barrel\nof quinine pills besides dozens of other remedies, but never obtained\nany permanent benefit. Last fall, in peach time, 1 had a most serious\nattack of chills and then commenced to take Ripans Tabules, upon a\nfriend\'s advice, and the first box made me all right and I have never\nbeen without them since. I take one Tabule each morning and night\nand sometimes when I feel more than usually exhausted 1 take three in\na day. They have kept my stomach sweet, my bowels regular and I\nhave not had the least touch of malaria nor splitting headache since I\ncommenced using them. I know also that I sieep better and wake up\nmore refreshed than tormerly. I don\'t know how many complaints\nRipans Tabules will help, but I do know they will cure any one in the\ncondition I was and I would not be without them at any price. I\nhonestly consider them the cheapest-priced medicine in the world, as\nthey are also the most beneficial and the most convenient to take.\nI am twenty-seven years of age and have worked hard all my life, the\nsame as most farmeis, both early and late and in all kinds of weather,\nand ! have never enjoved such good health as I have since last fall; in\nfact, my neighbors have ail remarked my improved condition and have\nsaid, “ Sav.

Stock\nwill not eat this grass, while the\naltalta is continuously cropped close\nto the ground and in course of time\nthe toxtail chokes out the altalta\nentirely. When this grass is mixed\nwith any other feed its beards work\ntheir way into the stock’s eyes and\nglands and in many instances in\njures the stock permanently. It\noften blinds hogs.\nIt is generally argued that alfalfa\nshould be mowed and fed to stock\ninstead of pasturing it and the con\nditions referred to prove the correct\nness ot this theory.—Suiter Far\nmer.\nThis is what the “Sun" has been\npreaching for years. When there\nhas been a good stand obtained,\nenough pains should be taken to\nkeep the weeds and toxtail out. To\ndo this no pasturing should be done,\nespecially in the early part of the\nseason when the weeds are growing.\nIt is self evident that it the stock eats\nthe altalta and leaves the weeds the\nlatter will get the advantage ot the\nformer. It will pay to cut the grass\nand teed it green it desired. It pays\nto exercise the intellect on any ot\nthe atlairs ot life.—Colusa Sun.\nIt is announced from Washington\nthat Secretary Hitchcock is prepar\ning to organize a forestry bureau in\nthe Interior Department to carry out\nan extensive system of reforestation,\nsomewhat on the plan successfully\npursued in Germany; It was too\nearly to go into the details, he said,\nbut the President and his colleagues\nwere satisfied with the practicability\nof the scheme and impressed with\nthe results which could be achieved\nin restoring the rapidly disappear\ning woodlands of the country.\nNothing achieved, unless all restrict\nions against the importation of for\neign timber are abolished.\nJ .Sterling Morton, who has long\nbeen an authority on tree-planting,\nsays in a recent number of the Con\nservative that every twenty-four\nhours the consumption of wood in\none form or another in this country\nequals all that can be prod need on\n25,000 acres, and that the new acer\nage pilanted every day does not ex\nceed twenty-five acres.
