It is a novel com-\nplaint for the Colonel to make. No man in\nAmerican public life has ever courted newspaper\nnotoriety so artfully and assiduously as lie. Xo\nother man has ever conducted himself in such a\nmaimer as to continually excite speculation and\npublic curiosity.\nWhile the colonel is complaiuinjf that the\nnewspapers will not let him alone, he is playing\nto the galleries and seeking a place on the bill\nboards. A short, plain, straightforward statement\nof his attitude and political intentions would re\nsolve at once the questions and doubts which sur\nround him and give a morbid interest to what\nhe savs. lie keeps stirring the political pot, but\nkeens evervbodv guessing as to what he intends\nto do. lie envelopes himself in the kind of inys-\nterv that invests a man who goes about wearing\na mask and a red cloak.\nAnd it is ciuite evident that the Colonel en\njoys the attention the newspapers pay him. Ho\nwould be grieved indeed if they neglected him\nand did not note his everv action and word. He\nis no shrinking mod est violet. It pleases him\nto be seen and heard, to hold tho center of the\nstage and standing in the limelight. His complaint\nis a Pickwickian expression of satisfaction that\nhe is successfully playing at one time the roles\nof -Jack Cade ami the Sphinx.\nColonel Roosevelt rigorously assail the arbi\ntration treaties, says the San Francisco Post, the\nSherman anti trust law and the judiciary, but he\nrefuses to say a word about the tariff, the parcels\npost, the granting of subsidies to American ship\nping or rebating the tolls on American ships\npassing through the Panama canal. While the\nreciprocity agreement with Canada was pending\nlie gave no expression of opinion ou that meas-\nure, but he was ready enough to attack the arbi\ntration treaties. His militant utterance on tome\npublic questions, coupled with hig studied re\nticence with regard to others, fill people with\nexpectancy.\nIn no instance has be given any expression of\napproval of anything that President Taft has\ndone, but he has criticized the enforcement of\nthe anti trust law and denounced the arbitration\ntreaties. Meanwhile bis admirers are boomine-\nhim for (.resident, and he declines to sav whether\nor not he is a candidate. Naturally he is an\nobject of popular interest and receives a good\ndeal of attention trom the press. But the fault is\nnot with the newspapers. The Colonel is himself\nresponsible for the notoriety he is receiving.\nRudyard Kipling has demonstrated that the\ncoming of the age of steam and electricity has\nincreased the possibilities of romance. Now comes\ntieorge It. Carter, former governor of Hawaii,\ndemonstrating the survival of romance in the\nmiddle age by sailing over 4220 miles of blue\nocean in order to have an extra week in the\ncompany of his wife to whom he has been mar\nried twentv-five years.\nRomance does not belong to the young world\nnor is it tne exclusive pronertv ot tne young\npeople in it. It exists even in an apartment\nhouse. It is to be found where the bald-headed\nmiddle-aged men congregate, as live and pal\npitating as where the young men with steel hel\nmets over long flowing locks used to gather.\nThe probable reason why it is not so conspicuous\nas it used to be is that it is kept hidden to a\ngreat extent by the middle-aged men of the\nmiddle age of the world.\nLadies, young and obi. and gentlemen young\nand old, is not the ride of the former governor\nof Hawaii over the ocean wastes to visit his\nwife a much more commendable feat than the\nride of young Lochinvar. who rode all unarmed\nand alone to break up a wedding? The modern\none is. the prettier and more inspiring romance,\nbut the tyrannical traditions will barely permit\nof its being recognized as romance.\nMiddle age is a little sheepish about insisting\non romance, i hat is the onlv reason whv it does\nnot find it as easily as youth. The middle-aged\nLochinvar who outdid the younger in this, the\nmiddle age of the world, deserves the thanks of\nhis kind for pointing out that romance is still\nours if we want it.\nLA FOLLETTE ON THE RECALL.\nRobert Marion La Follette, 1\'iiit.ed States c\nator from Wisconsin and a lawyer of prominence\nin ins state, came out boldly in favor of the re\ncall of judges, including those on the bench of the\nl. uited States supreme court. He would recal\'\nthose judges of the supreme court who read tin\nwords "reasonable" ami "unreasonable" into t!s\'\nSherman imti-tiiKl law. He is explicit.

The com\nmittee reports that the charge of bribery was\nnot proved. It might have added that the evi\ndence failed to show that any law was broken\nby Stephenson and his campaign managers.\nStephenson spent $107,000 in his campaign for\nre-election, but it was not shown that any money\nwas expended illegally. The election was held in\naccordance with a free-for-all primary law which\nplaces no restriction on the amount of money a\ncandidate may spend. Some people seem to think\nthe committee should have reported in favor of\nunseating Stephenson on the ground that he spent\ntoo much money, but as the money was spent\nla wf idly and nobody was corrupted (so far as\nthe testimony shows) the committee could not\nhave reported otherwise than it did. Jt is to be\nnoted in this connection also that La Follette,\nwho made the charge against his colleague, is the\nfather of the Wisconsin primary law. Had not\nStephenson broken with him politically La Fol\nlette would have had no fault to find\' with the\namount of money he spent.\nTONOPAH HARDWARE CO.\nHENRY H.
