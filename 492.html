In\nfact, if it had not been for all the de\nlay caused by the state insane hospital\nmlx-up and the resultant probe and its\naftermath, the entire legislative slate\nmight have been very nearly cleaned\nof everything in the way of general leg\nislation except the budget measures.\nLeaders In fiscal legislation are be\ntween two fires. They are anxious to\npress the important bills to final con\nsideration, and yet, realizing the inev\nitable finish fight that must develop\nbetween the low pressure or reaction\nary contingents, and the constructive\nforces, there is a kind of shrinking\nfrom the ordeal.\nIt is dead sura that institutional and\ndepartmental activity must be main\ntained, and while all departments are\ncalling for extra allowances, there must\nbe some compromise. As has been re\npeatedly asked, where is all the money\ncoming from with which to meet the\nallowances already made or yet to be\nmade?\nMost of the general legislative work\n-is eald to be out of the way, with the\nexception of the school code, and road\nlegislation which might be carried\nalong with the revenue and major op\nnmnriatiRn monanraa whlrh nrfc «H11 to\n.be disposed of. All of the big lnstltu\ntlons are still to be provided for, both\neducational and eleemosynary. The list\nIncludes those new ones which have\ncome Into being during the last twc\nyears, such as the South Mississippi\ncharity hospital at Laurel, the state tu\nberculosis Banltorlum at Magee, and\nthe Industrial and training school at\nColumbia, which are now going con\ncerns, and claiming support.\nScrap on Anti-Cigarette Bill.\nA bill Introduced in the house pro\nhibiting the sale of cigarettes within\nthe state of Mississippi has stirred up\ntobacco dealers and cigarette smokers\nwho are making a fight against the\nmeasure. The bill came back to the\nhouse with a favorable committee re\nport, which stiffened the backbone of\nthe proponents of the measure and\ncaused the opposition to work more\nactively.\nConvicts and Live Stock Both Well.\nJ. F. Thames, trustee of the peni\ntentiary, was in Jackson on his tour\nof Inspection of the several convict\nfarms, and reports prospects good for\na great crop of food stuffs. Much\nplowing has been done, especially on\nthe big farm at Parchman, and plant\ning will soon be well under way. Con\nvicts and live stock of all kinds are\nlooking well, says the trustee.\nRailroads Ask Mileage Change.\nAll railroads operating in Mississippi\nhave filed a petition with the railroad\ncommission requesting that body to li\nsue an order permitting the carriers\nto make effective Intrastate in Missis\nsippi the revised mileage book arrange\nment with the interstate commerce\ncommission has aDDroved for Interstate\ntraffic, that is, to substitute in lieu of\nthe present 1,000 and 2,000 Interchange\nable mileage books sold at $20 and $40,\nrespectfully, one Interchangeable book\nof denomination of 1,000 mileage cou\npons to be sold at $22.50 and to bs hon\nored under the same general rules, to\nbecome effective May 1, 191$.\nCarruthera’ Bill Falla.\nSenator Carruthers\' bill making\nmembers of boards of supervisors elec\ntive by the voters of a county at large,\nInstead of by districts, was indefinite\nly postponed In the senate, but was\nsaved from Instant death by a motion\nto reconsider.\nMembers of the boards of super\nvisors and otherB opposed to the bill\nhave been working hard to put the\nmeasure to sleep, and caught the Gre\nnada senator unawares In the senate.\nBefore the senator could muster his\nsupporters the opposition had the bill\non the road to the boneyard. The bill\nwas saved from Interment on a motion\nto reconsider, but it is doubtful if it\ncan be passed at this session on ac\ncount of the organized work of tha\nopposition.\nMay Drop Highway Probe.\nThe senate committees investiga\ntion of the state highway department\nseems to be lagging, and theie Is an\nImpression around the capitol that k\nmay be dropped.\nJ . i\nMORE SPRING WHEAT\nASKED OF FARMERS\nLarge Supply of Food and Feed\nstuff* Needed in 1918.\nAgricultural Department Asks Increas\ned Perk Production and Larger\nAcreage of drain Crepa.\nWashington. D. C.—The planting of\nan Increased acreage to epring wheat\nand the production of an Increased sup\nply of other food products and of live\nstock, especially hogs. Is recommend\ned In a supplementary food production\nprogram Issued by the United States\ndepartment of agriculture.\nThis program re-emphasizes and am\nplifies the food-production program\nfor 1918 Issued by the department In\nAugust, 1917, and other suggestions\nmade In the fall and the first of this\nyear regarding Increased pork produc\ntion and Increased production of food\nstuffs In the South. Taken In connec\ntion with the recommendations previ\nously made, It suggests In full the pro\nposals which the department thinks It\ndesirable to offer with a view to se\ncure enough meat and dairy prod\nucts, cereals, sugar and other staple\nand perishable foods, wool and cotton\nfor the nntlon. Its armies, and the al\nlies. It gives suggestions for the ap\nproaching spring operations, based\nupon the latest available Information\nas to the condition of the fall-planted\ncrops of winter wheat and rye and as\nto the number of meat and dairy ani\nmals reported for 1917. They repre\nsent the best thought of the special\nists of the department who have had\nthe benefit of advice from agricultu\nral leaders throughout the country.\nOur Beat Efforts Required.\n"Notwithstanding an Increased pro\nduction of staple cropa In the United\nStates In 1917. there la need for mere\nfood," tho program state*. “Taking\nInto account our own needs, the needs\nof the nations associated with us in\nthis war, and the needs of friendly\nneutral nations, our best efforts will\nbe required to provide enough food in\n1918. Whether the war continues or\nnot, the demands on this country, be\ncause of the increasing population and\nthe needs of Europe will be great An\nespecially strong demand will be made\non this country for meats and live\nstock. In 1917, notwithstanding the\nmany difficulties encountered, the\nfarmers planted the largest acreages\nIn the history of the nation, harvested\nrecord crops of most things except\nwheat, end succeeded in greatly in\ncreasing the number of live stock.”\n“The sltuntlon Is such that chief em\nphasis should be given to the produc\ntion of the great staple food products,\nwith special stress on wheat and hogs,\nthe leading war foods.”\nThe South Is urged to provide food\nfor Its own people and feed for its live\nstock and then to plant as much cotton\nas can well be cultivated and harvest\ned. To raisers of hogs and beef ani\nmals the world need for meats and\nfats Is made clear. Farmers are urged\nto join with the men on the ranges In\nproviding sheep whoso wool Is needed\nto equip soldiers.\nThe program discusses the farm la\nbor problem, points out the Uuee of ef\nfort for relief, and outlines the activi\nties of the federal and state agencies\nto furnish assistance.\nSpring Wheat.\nIn dealing with the question of\nspring wheat, the program states:\nTho acreage of aprlng wheat should\nbe Increased In order to make certain\nthat we shall have an adequate supply\nof wheat for our own uses and to moot\nthe needs of tho allleo.\n»*mie me area or winter wneat\nsown In 1917 was the largest on record,\nthe condition of the crop, as reported\non December 1, was the lowest ever\nrecorded, indicating a probable produc\ntion of only 540,000,000 bushels.\nWhether the actual production will be\ngreater or less than the estimate will\ndepend upon conditions prevailing be\ntween now and the time of harvest. If\nthere were planted to spring wheat in\nthe United States this year an acreage\nequal to the sum of the record planting\nIn each spring wheat stata within the\nlast ten years, there would be sown ap\nproximately 23,300,000 acres. If there\nshould be planted an acreage equal to\nthe sum of the record planting for each\nstate within the last flva years there\nwould be sown approximately 21,000,\n000 acres. The record planting for any\nyear was 20381.000, m 1911. The acre\nage for 1917 waa 18311,000.\n“The department of agriculture has\ncarefully studied all these records and\nother data in connection with the pres\nent war condition* and needs, and be\nlieves that it will be possible this year\nto aecure an acreage In exceaa of the\nrecord acreage which was planted in\n1911. It is believed that increased\nacreages can be secured in states and\nsections where spring-wheat production\nIs known to be reasonably promising,\nand that such Increases can be made\nwithout upsetting farm plans.\nIt Is hoped that many farmers, espe\ncially In the northern part of the corn\nbelt, will find It possible to plant five\nto ten acres additional in wheat. In\nseme cases they will plant more. In\ni\na number of states In the eastern aad\ncentral portions of the country where\nspring wheat has not been grown In\nrecent years, the crop is now being re\nestablished and It la recommended that\nthis movement be encouraged.\nTo n small extent the acreage In\noats. If necessary, could be reduced la\nthe Interest of wheat. Likewise, a\nvery small portion of the ecreage\nwhich normally would be planted to\ncorn In the northern part of the corn\nbelt might be sown to spring wheat.\nIf the acreage of spring wheat indi\ncated for some of the states cannot be\nplanted, the barley acreage, which Is\nknown to grow better In some locu I\ntles, might be Increased. The use of\nbarley for food is Increasing In this\ncountry and It Is a welcome food In\nEurope.\nSummary of Other Recommendations.\nFollowing Is a summary of other Im\nportant recommendations regarding\ncereals, meut, poultry, and perishables.\nHogs. The number of bogs should\nbe increased by at least 15 per cent\nduring the year 1918.\nSugar. Effort should be made to\nmaintain the acreage of sugar cane and\nsugar beets, and to Increase these\nareas In so far as these crops are well\nestablished or are necessary to sound\nagricultural practice.\nProduction of satisfactory substi\ntutes for sugar, including sorghum,\ncorn and cane sirup, maple products\nand honey can and should be In\ncreased.\nSorghum simp, It is pointed out, may\nbe produced In nearly every state in\nthe Union, and Increased production of\nsorghum sweets would enable the pub\nlic to conserve still further the sugar\nsupply In the form most available for\ntransportation to our soldiers.\nDairy Product*. The supply of dairy\nproducts should be maintained to meet\nthe needs of this country and to help\nsupply the Increasing demands of the\nallies.\nPoultry. Poultry production should\nur iiiitfuhi greauy, especially in osrg\nyards and on farms where waste mate\nrial Is available and the purchase of\nexpensive grains and other material Is\nnot required.\nCorn. An acreage of corn approxi\nmately equal to that of 1917 should he\nplanted, with possible slight reductions\nIn certain sections to free areas for\nspring wheat.\nOats, Barley, Rios, Buckwheat and\nFlaxseed. The area In oats should be\nmaintained, especially In regions and\non soils which are not so well adapted\nto other grains, but with a small reduc\ntion to provide for Increasing the\nwheat acreage. Barley production\nshould be Increased in regions where\nIt grows best, especially la the north\nern edge of the corn belt and In sec\ntions north and west of the belt; and\nrice, buckwheat and flaxseed produc\ntion should be maintained and. If pos\nsible, Increased.\nGrain Sorghums. The production of\ngrain sorghums (kaflr, mllo, feterita,\netc.) should be Increased greatly\nthroughout the drier portion of ths\nPlains region. Kafirs are the most\ncertain grain crops In this section and\nthey can be made to supplement wheat\nas hamaa food and to replace corn as\nanimal food.\nPotatoes. The normal acreage of\nIrish and sweet potatoes should be\nmaintained In 1918, notwithstanding\nthe large crops In 1917.\nHay, Forage and Pictures. Wher\never feasible, the area devoted to hay,\nforage and silage crops should be In\ncreased and these products should be\nused to a greater extent In place of\ngrains and other concentrates.\nBeef Animals. The number of beef\nanimals should be maintained and, la\nareas where It Is clearly the best range\nand farm practice, should be Increased.\nBtina. Pbbb and Ppanuta. Thu nriv i\nduction of beans and peas should be\nincreased In regions to which they are\nadapted, because of their high food\nvalue, keeping qualities, and availabil\nity for domestic or export trade. Soy\nbeans and peanuts should be Increased\nIn order to supplement beans and peas\nas human food, a8 a source of much\nneeded oil, and as animal feeds.\nPerishables, (a) Market gardens\nnear large consuming centers should\nbe Increased so as to meet, as nearly\nas possible, the needs of the communi\nty, and In order to obviate the neces\nsity of transporting such products\nfrom distant points.\nIt Is important to do all that is pos\nsible to relieve the strain upon trans\nportation faculties.\n(b) The planting of home gardens,\n•specially for family needs and for\npreserving food for future use, again\nshould be emphasised.\n(c) The commercial production of\nperishables generally\' should be In\ncreased above normal wherever It la\nreasonably clear that transportation\nand marketing facilities will be avail\nable.\nLiterally.\n"We\'ve got to get a good actor to\nplay the role of Satan In that spec\ntacular performance."\n\'Then there’ll be the devil to pay I"\nInstinctive Dislike.\n“Do you like the cllnglng-vlne va\nriety of people?"\n“Not much. They’re too apt to be\nsome kind of suckera.”\nGREAT DRIVE FOR\nSHIPYARD HELP\nCall for 250,000 Volunteers to\nAid in Speeding the New\nMerchant Fleet.\nTO BE READY WHEN CALLED\nReaerve Organization Formed to Com.\nplete Gigantic Program to Win\nWar—Good Pay and Living\nConditions.\nThe United States Shipyard Volun\nteers of the Public Service Reserve, a\nreserve organisation of American me\nchanics, skilled workers In many lines\nof trade, has been formed to bring to\ncompletion the gigantic shipbuilding\nprogram necessary to win the war.\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand work\nmen are to be enrolled and they will\nstand ready, when called to go to the\nshipyards and speed America’s mer\nchant fleet to completion.\nAn appeal for volunteers has been\nmode by the department of labor,\nthe council of national defense, the\nshipping board, the 20,000 four-minuts\nmen, governors of the various states,\norganized labor and business men.

Should there be no\nenrolling agent In the vicinity, they\nare asked to write to Edward N. Hur\nley, chairman of the United States\nshipping board, Washington.\nCards are issued to all applicants,\nbearing statements of the purpose of\nthe shipyard volunteers, classifying\nthem according to trades and asking\nsigners to respond when called. But\ntons will be given to volunteers bear\ning the Inscription, “U. S. Shipyard\nVolunteers." This button Is to be an\nhonorary recognition of the wearer’s\nwillingness to sacrifice personal desires\nfor public need. In addition, the\nworker will receive a certificate signed\nby Chairman Hurlty, which reads:\n"This Is to certify (name of vol\nunteer) of (city, state), has\nenrolled In the United States\nShipyard Volunteers of Pub\nlic Service Reserve to aid the\nnation in Its Imperative needs\nfar merchant ship* with which to\novercome the submarine menace\nand maintain our forms at the\nfront.”\nQuota of Each State.\nEach atate has been assigned a\nquota, based upon the population and\nIndus tries.

It Is no military se\ncret that equipment and supplies for\nmen of the second draft will become\navailable soon after April 1, and care\nful observers look for the first incre\nments to be called soon afterward\nThe number of men to be called in\nthe first increment has not yet been\ndetermined, because the question of\nhousing them has not been disposed\nof. There will be room for some of\nthem In camps and cantonments now\noccupied by troops, and It Is possible\nthat additional cantonments may have\nto be provided. It is also possible\nthat some of the national guard\ncamps may be used during the period.\nThis phase of the subject Is being\ngiven careful study, but nothing has\neen decided.\n700,000 RIFLES PRODUCED.\nOrdnance Bureau Reports on Output\nof Factories.\nWashington.—Seven Hundred thou\nsand army rifles have been produced\nin the United States since this coun\ntry entered the war, according to a\nstatement made public by the ord\nnance bureau of the War Department.\nDuring the week ending Feb. 3 the\ndally production was 7,085 Enfields,\nand 1,443 Sprlngfields, or a total of\nv.zvf service rifles added to the\nstock ervery day.\nSAVE RUSSIA FROM TEUTONS\nBolahevlki Revolutionists Mobilize to\nResist Invasion of Germans\nIn Russia\nNew York.—Determination to save\nthe Russian revolution from the re\nactionary control of the German mili\ntarists has- become the dominant\npolicy of the Bolahevlki.\nBy calling for a revolutionary mo\nbilization, the Bolshevik leaders have\nshown the true spirit of the Fren ;h\nrevolution and have demonstrated\ntheir own strength of character whe i\ndriven to make momentous decisions.\nHereafter It will be impossible for the\nGermans to play at having conquered\nRussia. Whatever may be Russia’s\ndifficulties and however the Slavs\nmay appear to have been overwhelm\ned, this week\'s developments show\nthat the spirit of democracy has\nthrilled the country too many months\nfor Von Hlndenburg to gain control\nof the country.\nTHREE FLYERS MEET DEATH\nAviators at Millington Crash Together\nand Tumble 500 Feet to In\nstant Death.\nMemphis.—Guy H. Reagle. In\nstructor, and Cadets James H. Webb\nand Robert Gray, Jr., were Instantly\nkilled when the airship occupied by\nReagle and Webb collided with a ship\ndriven by Gray at an altitude of BOO\nfeet at Park Field.\nThe collision occurred In what 1*\nknown as neutral air space, north of\nthe aviation field. Both machines fall\nto the ground, striking nose first. The\nbodies of Instructor and the two ca\ndets were horribly mangled by the\nfall and the ships were smashed Into\nsmall pieces.\nTakes Reduced Rank for Activity.\nWashington—Because of a desire\nfor active service.

The steamer is equipped\nwith more than 12,000 air and watar\ntight cells, which the Inventor claims\nwill keep the vessel afloat oven should\nshe He torpedoed.\nGUN PATROL Mil\n22 HUNSjAPUVE\nAMERICAN TROOPS PENETRATE\nGERMAN TRENCHES AND BRING\nIN GERMAN PRISONERS.\nNO AMERICAN CASUALTIES\nGerman Patrol Trlca to Cut Wire De\nfenaea. But Heavy Gunfire Drives\nThem Out — Germans Using\nNew Type of Bomb.\nWith the American Army in France.\n—An American patrol In the Che\nmln-des-Dames sector. In conjunc\ntion with a French patrol, penetrated\na few hundred yards Into the Oerman\nlines, and captured two German of\nflcer% 20 men and one machine gun.\nThere was some sharp fighting and\na number of the enemy were killed\nand wounded. There were no Ameri\ncan casualties. The Franco-Amerlcan\npatrol was under command of a\nFrench officer.\nThe German bombardment on vari\nous points within the American lines,\nnortheast of Toul, Is becoming more\nIntense than usual. Little damage\nhas been done by the bombardment.\nEnemy patrols are making persist\nent efforts to penetrate the American\nwire defenses, but without success.\nOne patrol was fired upon and driven\noff while wire cutting, probably prep\naratory to a contemplated raid.\nIn the American sector northwert\nof Toul. the Germans tried the tactl.ra\nof concentrating artillery fire on one\nof the American position*, apparent’?\nwith the purpose of obliterating It.\nAmerican guns immediately punished\nthe German batteries with a double\nheavy retaliatory fire and then swept\nthe enemy lines with a vicious bar\nrage, undoubtedly inflicting consider\nable damage.\nThe German guns promptly ceased\nfire. Whether they were silenced or\nstopped firing for other reasons is\nunknown, but since that time hardly a\nshot has been fired from that point.\nLater another German patrol was\nfound within the American wire.

This measure\nwas much discussed in different\nparts of the state in the last cam\npaign and if the present lawmakers\nfail to write it on the statute books,\nthere is going to be a reckoning at\nthe polls next time, as its a law high\nly in the interest of preventing lands\npassing into the hands of the\nwealthy and keeping them distribu\nted among small farmers; a condi\ntion greatly essential to the prosper\nity and happiness of any free people.\nMany a time two years of grace\nmakes all the difference in the world\nto a poor man about redeeming his\nland sold under mortgage foreclosure\nsale; notably the tirst two years <>f\nthe war in the cotton section of this\nstate when prices were sn low and\nso modi money lost, and see \' now in\nhow short a space of time it has\ngone to unprecedented prices for\nthese times.

The food administration\nlias no power to regulate retail prices\nexcept by public opinion. Even though\nmore than 85,000 tons of sugar have\nbeen shipped to France In the last\nfour months the retail grocer\'s sugar\nprice Is around 8 to 8V& cents. Fie\nshould sell this sugar at 8V4 to 9\ncents, the food administration believes,\nand asks the American housewife to\npay no more than this nmount.\nLast August when the food admin\nistration was organized the price of\nsugar rose suddenly to 11 cents a\npound. During the Civil War sugar\ncost the consumer 35 cents a pound.\nBy Regulation of the sugar market and\n1 und keeping It from advancing to 20\nj cents the food administration has sav\n! ed the American public at least $180,\n■ 000,000 In four months, according to\na statement made by Herbert Hoover\n| the other day.\n“It Is our stern duty to feed the al\nlies, to maintain their health and\nstrength at any cost to ourselves,”\nMr. Hoover declared. “There has not\nbeen, nor will be ns we see It, enough\nsugar, for even their present meagre\nand depressing ration unless they send\nships to remote markets for It. If we\nin our greed and gluttony force them\neither to further reduce their ration\nor to send these ships we will have\ndone damage to our abilities to win\nthis war.\n“If we send the ships to Java\nfor 250,000 tons of sugar next year\nwe will have necessitated the em\nployment of eleven extra ships for\none year. These ships—If used In\ntransporting troops—would taka\n150,000 to 200,000 men to France."\nReason for World Shortage.\nAs Mr. Hoover pointed out, the\nUnited States, Cnnada and England\nwere sugar Importing countries before\nthe war, while France and Italy were\nvery nearly self supporting. The main\nsources of the world’s sugar supply\nwas Germany and neighboring powers,\nthe West Indies and the East Indies.\nGerman sugar Is no longer available,\nas It Is used entirely In Germany,\nwhich also absorbs sugar of surround\ning countries.\nEngland can no longer buy 1,400,000\nlong tons of sugnr each year from\nGermany. The French sugar produc\ntion has dropped from 750,000 to 210,\n000 tons. The Italian production lias\nfallen from 210,000 tons to 75,000 tons.\nThus three countries were thrown\nupon East and West Indlun sources\nfor 1,025,000 tons annually to maintain\ntheir normal consumption.\nHera use of the world’s shipping\nshortage the allied nations started\ndrawing on the West Indies for sugar;\nEast Indian sugar took three times\nthe number of ships, since the dis\ntance wns three times ns great Sud\ndenly the west wns called on to fur\nnish and did tarnish 1.420.000 tons of\nsugar to Europe when 300,000 tons a\nyear was the pre-war demund. The\nallies had drawn from Java 400,000\ntons before the shipping situation be\ncame acute.\n“In spite of these shipments,” Mr.\nHoover stated the other day, “the\nEnglish government In August reduced”\nthe household sugar ration to a basis\nof 24 pounds per annum per capita.\nAnd In September the French govern\nment reduced thetr household ration\nto 13 2-10 pounds a year, or n hit over\n1 pound of sugar a month. Even this\nmeagre rntlon could not be tilled by\nthe French government It was found\nearly In the fall. America win then\nasked for 100,000 tons of sugar and\nsucceeded In sending 85,000 tons by\nDecember 1. The French request was\ngranted because the American house\nhold consumption was then at least 55\npounds per person, and It was consid\nered the .duty of maintaining the\nFrench morale made our course clear."\nToday the sugar situation may\nbe summarized by stating that If\nAmerica will reduce Its sugar con\nsumption 10 to 15 per cent, this\nnation will be able to send 200,000\nmore soldiers to France.\nSugar today sells at seaboard r*>\nfineries at $7.25 a hundred pounds.\nThe wholesale grocer haB agreed to\nlimit his profit to 25 cents a hundred\nplus freight, and the retail grocer Is\nsupposed to take no more than 50 cents\na hundred pounds profit This regu\nlation was made by the food adminis\ntration, which now asks the housewife\nto reduce sugar consumption as much\nas possible, using other sweeteners,\nund also reminds her that she should\npay no more than 9 centa a pound for\nsugar.\nControl of Csne Refiners’ Profits.\nrri<\n‘\'Immediately upon the establish\nment of the food administration.” Air.\nfloover snld, “an examination wai\n, made of the costs nnd profits of refln\nlng and it was finally determined that\n, the spread between the cost of raw\nand the sale of refined cune sugar\nshould be limited to (1.30 per\'hundred\npounds. The pre-war differential had\naveraged about 85 cents and increased\ncosts were found to have been lmpoa\ned by the war In Increased cost of re\nfining, losses, cost of bags, labor, Insur\nance, Interest and other thlnga, rather\nmore than cover the difference. After\nprolonged negotiations the refiners\nwere placed under agreement estab\nlishing these lirptts on October 1, and\nanything over this amount to be agreed\nextortlonnte under the law.\n“In the course of these Investiga\ntions It was found by canvass of the\nCuban producers that their sugar had,\nduring the first nine months of the\npast year, sold for an average of about\n(-1.24 per hundred f. o. b. Cuba, to\nwhich duty and freight added to the\nrefiners’ cost amount to about $5.00\nper hundred. The average sale price\nof granulated by various refineries, ac\ncording to our Investigation, was about\n$7.50 per hundred, or a differential of\n$1.84.\n“In reducing the differential to $1.30\nthere was a saving to the public of 54\ncents per hundred. Had such a dif\nferential been In use from the 1st of\ni January, 1017, the public would have\nsaved In the first nine months of the\n: year about $24,800,000.”\nNext Year.\nWith a view to more efficient organ\nization of the trade In Imported sugars\n| next year two .committees have been\nformed by the food administration:\n1. A committee comprising repre\nsentatives of all of the elements of\nAmerican cane refining groups. The\nprincipal duty of thla committee is to\ndivide the sugar Imports pro rata to\ntheir various capacities and see that\nabsolute justice U done to every re\nfiner.\n2. A committee comprising three rep\nresentatives of the English, French\nand Italian governments; two repre\nsentatives of the American refiners,\nwith a member of the food administra\ntion. Only two of the committee have\narrived from Europe, but they repre\nsent the ullied governments. The du\nties of this committee are to determine\nthe most economical sources from a\ntransport point of view of all the al\nlies to arrange transport at uniform\nrates, to distribute the foreign sugar\nbetween the United States and allies,\nsubject to the approval of the Ameri\ncan, English, French wnd Italian gov\nernments.\nThis committee, while holding strong\nviews as to the price to be paid for\nCuban sugar, has not had the final\nvoice. This voice has rested In the\ngovernments concerned, together with\nthe Cuban government, and I wish to\nstate emphatically that all of the gen\ntlemen concerned as good commercial\nmen have endeavored with the utmost\npatience and skill to secure a lower\nprice, and their persistence has re\nduced Cuban demands by 15 cents per\nhundred. The price ngreed upon Is\nabout $4.00 per hundred pounds, f. o. b.\nCuba, or equal to about $0 duty paid\nNew York.\n“This price should eventuate,”\nMr. Hoover said, "to about $7.30\nper hundred for refined sugar from\nthe refiners at seaboard points or\nshould place sugar in the hands of\nthe consumer at from 8j/j to 9\ncents per pound, depending upon\nlocality and conditions of trade, or\nat from 1 to 2 cents below the\nprices of August last and from one\nhalf to a cent per pound cheaper\nthan today.\n“There Is now an elimination of\nspeculation, extortionate profits, and\nIn the refining alone the American\npeople will save over $25,000,000 of\nthe refining charges last year. A part\nOf these savings goes to the Cuban,\nHawaiian, Porto Rican and Ixmslunlan\nproducer and part to the consumer.\n“Appeals to prejudice agnlnst the\nfood administration have been made\nbecause the Cuban price Is 34 cents\nabove that of 1917. It Is said In effect\nthat the Cubnns are at our mercy;\nthat we could get sugar a cent lower.\nWe made exhaustive study of the cost\nof producing sugar In Cuba last year\nthrough our own agents In Cuba, and\nwe find It averages $3.39, while many\nproducers are at a higher level. We\nfound that an average profit of at\nleast a cent per pound wus necessnry\nIn order to maintain and stimulate\nproduction or that a minimum price of\n$4.37 was necessary, and even this\nwould stifle some producers.\n“The price ultimately agreed was 23\ncents above these figures, or about one\nfifth of a cent per pound to the Ameri\ncan consumer, and more than this\namount has been saved by our reduc\ntion In refiners’ profits. If we wish to\nstifle production In Cuba we could\ntake that course just at the time of all\ntimes in our history when we want\nproduction for ourselves and the al\nlies. Further than that, the state de\npartment will assure you that such a\ncourse would produce disturbances In\nCuba and destroy even our present\nsupplies, but beyond all these material\nreasons Is one of human Justice. This\ngreat country has no right by the\nmight of Its position to strangle Cuba.\n“Therefore there Is no Imposition\nupon the American public. Charges\nhave been made before this commit\ntee that Mr. Rolph endeavored to ben\nefit the California refinery of which he\nwas manager by this 84 cent increase\nIn Cuban price. Mr. Rolph did not fix\nthe price. It does raise the price to\nthe Hawaiian farmer about that\namount. It does not raise the profit of\nthe California refinery, because their\ncharge for refining Is, like all other re\nfiners, limited tp $1.30 per hundred\n/\n»\n____\nBetter Farming in the South\nFERTILIZER PRECAUTIONS\n-\nPlant Food Should Have A Legal Guarantee Of Availa*\nbility If It Is To Measure Up To Nation’s Pressing\nFood Demands •\nJ. C. Prldmore, Farm Service.

C. PRII1MORE.torth lu the coming\nmonths.\nIf the southern farmer is to do his\nshare in producing foods for man and\nbeast, and, at the same time, grow cot\nton fibre for the nation, he must either\nIncrease his crop acreage, or else grow\nconsiderably more per acre than cus\ntomary.\nIn view of the scarcity and high\nprice of labor at the present time,\nit seems to be the part of wisdom\nfor fanners generally not to mate\nrially increase the crop acreage, but\nto increase the acre yields.\nIncrease Yield Per Acre\nAcre yields can be increased by\nbetter preparation of the seed bed, by\nthe use of good seed of varieties adapt\ned to the region, by using a more lib\neral application of the right kinds of\nfertilizers and by better cultivation of\nthe growing crops.\nWhile ail of these factors influence\nacre yields, let us call particular at\ntention at this time to the kind and\namount of fertilizer to be used. Prac\ntically all of the southern soils are\ndeficient in phosphoric acid, nitrogen\nand potash und these must be supplied\nin some form to get the largest yields\nand biggest farm profits. While the\nproper use of these materials will in\ncrease the yields per acre and help\nsupply the nation\'s needs, the wise\nfarmer will at the same time strive\nto get the largest financial returns\nfrom their use. To do this, he inust\nexercise care in buying them as well\nas in applying them.\nThe farmer should understand that\nplants use fertilizers as foods only af\nter they have been dissolved by the\nsoil water, and that which is not sol\nuble is not available to the plant. It\nIs to the farmer’s interest, therefore,\nto know that the fertilizers he is buy\ning are guaranteed to contain a stated\namount of available plant food.\nQuick Acting Form.\nFor the beat results in the cultlva- !>.\ntlon of general field crops, materials it\ncarrying phosphoric acid, nitrogen and i\nsome potash should be applied. Pot- J\nash is more deficient In the light and f\nsandy soils than in clay soils. Not \'\nless than 160 to 200 pounds of com\nplete fertilizers per acre should be >V,\nused and hundreds of farmers find\nmore than this amount to be most V\nprofitable.

Just as if tracing\nItp outline.

O. BELl,KRS. Acting Director ol\nthe Sunday School Courie of the Moody\nBible Institute, Chicago.)\n(Copyright, ISIS, Western Newspaper Union )\nLESSON FOR MARCH 3\nJK8U3 BRINGING PEACE.\nLESSON TEXT-Mark 4:35-6:20.\nGOLDEN TEXT—Jehovah hath dons\ngreat things for us whereof we are glad.\n-Ps. 126 ::8.\nDEVOTIONAL READING-Ps. 147:1-6,\n14-1*.\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL FOR\nTEACHERS-Matt. 8:23-34: Luke 8:23-J9;\nMatt. 14:22-33; Luke 9:37-43A.\nPRIMARY LESSON MATERIAle—Mark\n4:16-41.\nMEMORY VERSE—Even the wind and\nthe sea obey him.—Mark 4:41.\nINTERMEDIATE TOPIC-TelUng the\ngood news about the Prince of Peace.\nMEMORY VERSE—Mark 6:19.\nThis lesson Is a most dramatic one.\nSurprise and revelation, rebuke and\nencouragement nre rapidly Inter\nchanged. Leaving the multitude to\nwhom he had been preaching* Jesus\nasks the disciples to pass over with\nhim to the other side of the lake (v.\n36). "Let us puss over;" Jesus never\nasks his disciples to go where he will\nnot go. How vivid is the touch In v,\n36: "They took him as he was." He\nwas tired and weary, he whose Invita\ntion Is to “all who nre weary and\nheavy Inden." He who “hnd not where\nto lay his head,” Is carried by loving\nhands into the boat, and Is soon lost\nIn restful sAumber. Both Master and\nfrleuds nre soon to meet a great sin\nner but first they must encountered a\ngreat storm.\nI. The Great Storm. The Master of\nforces sleeps calmly on. Why not?\nWho else could afford to be so appar\nently Indifferent! Not so these dis\nciples. They have yet to know him\nperfectly, and hence It Is natural that\nIn their alarm they should awaken\nhim as they view the rapidly filling\nboat, and exclaim, "Master, carest thou\nnot that we perish?" Weary and un\nconcerned as he appears to have been,\nhe arose and rebuked the wind and\nthe waves. Wind and waves are mate\nrial things and therefore not suscep\ntible to rebuke. Jesus fronted the In\ntangible cause; he rebuked the devil\nwho was responsible for this turbul\nence; and the calm was commensurate\nwith the storm. The Psalmist says,\n"Great peace have they that love thy\nlaw.” Individuals and nations are\nnow In the midst of n “great storm,”\na day of crime, stress, distress and\ntragedy; struggle, temptation, grief\nand loss, and the cry “Lord save us I”\nIs growing louder and more insistent\nSome of us look for the early return\nof the king, but all should listen for\nhis words "Peace be still” for It Is\nthe peace whtch he alone can give\nthat has power to calm the growing\nturbulence of thin age.\nII. The Great 8lnner. Reaching the\nother side, they entered the land of\nGadara and there met a demoniac who\nIs, we believe, a type of the great sin\nner, for he was, (a) without restraint;\n“no man could bind him” (v. 8); (b)\nhe wns Injuring himself, "cutting,”\netc. (v. 5) ; (c) he wns separated\nfrom his friends, “dwelt among the\ntombs” (v. 8); (d) he was “unclean"\n(v. 2). There was also evidence of\nthe futility of human resolutions and\nthe vainness of attempt at control or\nreformation (v. 4). “No man had the\nstrength to tame him.” Note the tor\nment of his life (v. 7). As he healed\nthis man, the people saw their illegal\ngain Interfered with, and hence the\nselfish request that Jesus should “de\npart out of their coasts” (v. 17), and\nthis even In the face of what had been\ndone for the stricken one. Selfishness\nknows no law. The Jews could not\neat pork but they were raising It to\nsell to the Gentiles of the land, which\namounted to an Insult to their God,\nand an evasion of their law. Jesus\n“permitted” the demons to enter the\nawine thereby rebuking the avarice of\nthe people and conclusively showing\nthat they had left the demoniac. Luke\ntells us (8:37) that the Gadarenes\nwere “token with a great fear.” Fear\nof what? Surely no fear of the Gali\nlean teacher, but rather of the effect\nof the restored man\'s testimony on\ntheir material prosperity. Big busi\nness will have many sins to account\nfor In the face of greed for gain while\nIgnoring the cry of the afflicted amid\nunsuitable and unsanitary living con\nditions. Church members have no\nright to condemn the liquor traffic,\nwhile they rent stores to carry on this\ndestructive business.\nA suggested outline for this lesson\nwould be as follows:\nI. A Great Storm—Cb. 4:85-41.\nThe command of Jesus—v. 35.\nThe weariness of Jesus—v. 86.\nThe alarm of the disciples—v. 38.\nThe Indifference of Jesus—v. 88\nThe great calm—v. 89.\nII. A Glorious Curo—Ch. 5:1-20.\nThe Gadarene a type of the sin\nner—vv. 1-6.\n(Unclean, separated, no re\nstraint, self Injury).\nThe Gadarene cleansed—w. 6-J5.\n(He recognized purity—desired\ncommunion—was assigned to\nservice).\nIII. The Great Mission—rc. 16-20.\nAn improper request (v. 17).\nA proper request (v. 18).\nA hard request (v. 19).\nA great result (see Luke 8:46).\nThe nations are In storm. The de*\nmons of passion, bate and lust of pow\ner are loosed In the world; let us “be\nseech him" to return that he may speak\n“peace."']</pre>
