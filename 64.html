The affair, took place in front of the Vogue, liquor store in the Palace hotel, block at 10:30 o\'clock in a blinding, dtorm of falling snow. Sparks, at, once surrendered himself and was, locked up., Sparks, who came to Prescott, but a month ago from Nogales,, has for sometime been dealing a, game of fero in the Wellington, saloon. He is a man of small statue,, quiet and inoffensive. One of his, players in the early evening was, Andre, a Frenchman, a man about, 39 year of age and of powerful, physique. He was a hangeron, around the red light district. Fol, lowing an altercation over the pay, ment of a bet Andre had made of, a case card Andre struck a blow, Sparks over the eye, cutting a gash, several inches in length. Andre then, left the table, cashed his checks at, the bar and auit the saloon., Sparks was soon relieved as dealer, and after washing the wound he had, received, he "also left the saloon,, being generally understood that the, affair was ended. About half a, block from the saloon Spirks met, Andre and some further words en-\', sued when Sparks drew his gun and, fired. The shot from a forty-fiy, calibre revolver took effect in the, center of Andre\'s forehead, passing, out the back of the head. He lived, but a few moments. Sparks walked, back to th-. Wellington saloon and, gave himself up to Frank Burns, a, deputy sheriff who was in the sa, loon. At the scene of the shooting a, large crowd soon gathered. The, white carpet of snow gathered, showed crimson stains for nearly, thirty feet around where the body, of Andre lay. A coroner\'s jury, viewed the remains and adjourned, to meet Wednesday.

Sober, conservatve journals, such as the Scientific Amercan,, concede that success has at last, been attained., Since the Montgolfier brothers, first went a ballooning in 1783, in, ventors have puzzled their brains, over the designing of the craft, which should sail the air as do the, ships at sea. The limitations of the, balloon were apparent it could, remain aloft but a brief time and, was at the mercy of every shifting, air current. An airship which could, sail like a bird, mount and descnd, at will and head in any direction, the pilot chose was the desideratum., The failures have been almost num, berless. Professor Langly added by a $50,, 000 Government appropriation, la, bored long on his aeroplane model,, only to fail. Santos-Dumont has, been successful in constructing di, rigible balloons capable of main, taining sustained flight for several, , hours, as has also Baldwin, of Cal, ifornia. Many have marveled at, the daring of Knabenshue as he, sailed away into the clouds, but, these vessels were only balloons, with steering and propelling appar, atus, and dependent upon gas for, their buoyancy. Their small size, and frailty made them nothing, more than wonderful toys., The machine perfected by the, Wrights is an aeroplane. It dis, penses with gas bags and utilizes, the principale of the buzzards,, flight, gliding through the air., In recent experiments in England, th; machine demonstrated its in, ventors\' claims by rising from the, ground to a considerable altitude, turning soaring upward and down, ward, at all times completely under, the control of the operator. The, success of this trial machine would, seem to prove that the problem is,, indeed solved and that larger ma, chines may be built after the same, pattern capable of carrying consid, erable loads., So confident is the French Gov, ernment of the near approach of, practical aerial locomotion that, several commissions are actually at, work elaborating plans for meeting,, in the various branches of the pub, lic service, the many new problems, which the revelation will detail,, and the prophecy is freely made, that within a short time arships, will be as common as automobiles,, Notice of Restoration to Settle, ment, Entry, Filing and Selection, of Lands formerly Within the Grand, Canyon Forest Reserve, Arizona., Department of the Interior, Gen, eral Land Office, Washington, D., C, October 9, 190G. in pursuance, of the proclamation of the Presi, dent of the United States, dated, August 8, 1906 excluding from the, Grand Canyon Forest Reserve, Ari, zona, the unsurveyed areaas des, cribed below, and restoring to set, tlement the public lands therein,, notice is hereby given that the said, public lands will become subject to, entry, under the usual restrictions,, at the United States Land Office for, the district in which the lands lie,, viz: Phoenix, Arizona, on January, 21, 1906: All the land in the former, Grand Canyon Forest Reserve, as, enlarged by proclamation dated, May 6, 1905, not included within, the boundaries of the present re, serves established by proclamation, of August8, 1906.

A majority of, our manufactures have been label, ing their goods in conformity with, the new law for the past few months, and our stores are pretty well, stocked with the new goods., The principle of the law is that, the buyer shall get what he pays, for the label shall represent ex, actly what the package contains., He is not to get something, "equally as good," or better, but, what he wants, or thinks he wants., No buyer really wants adulterants,, fancy colorings, preservatives, etc.,, but wants "the real thing." This, the new law is supposed to secure, for him, and the public will watch, with hopefulness its zealous en, forcement. A great deal of harm, is done at present to unsuspecting, stomachs by the inclusion in drugs, and foods of substances not "down, on the bill." This abuse will, doubtless be measurably abated and, every article will disclose to the, consumer the amount of preserva, tive composition and adulturation, of the foods or drugs he puchase-., Notice of Reception or Bids, Notice is hereby given, that seal, ed bids will be received by the board, of supervisors of Coconino county,, Arizona from now, up to the hour, of ten o\'clock a. m. on the 7th day, of January, 1907, for the care,, keeping and maintenance of the, indigent sick, in Coconinco County, for the year 1907 and for the fur, nishing meals to prisoners in the, County jail, for the year 1907., Such bids must state the amount, per meal, for the meals proposed, to be furnished to such prisoners., Such bids must also state, in de, tail, at how much per capita, per, day the bidder proposes to maintain, the indigent sick., All bids must be sealed and ad, dressed to "the Clerk of the Board, of Supervisors of Coconino County,, Arizona" and must be plainly, marked outside "Bid for the Care, of Indigent Sick.", A copy of this notice must be, attached to each Bid.

At first, there wa a feeling that her wishes, in life should be respected in death, that even in the grave she should, keep up the part of man sue chose, to play. It was planned that she, be buried garbed in the long Prince, Albert coat and the dark trousers, which had been her favorite costume, in the part she took. But other, counsel prevailed and the woman, went to her grave in a long silk, robe of white a soft, dainty, wo, manly garment in which one won, dered how De Raylan was ever tak, en for a man., Death had erased the care lines, from her face. She was scarcely, 30 years of age and in her coffin she, looked to be hardly more than a, girl. To those who looked upon her, thus, the tragedy of hjr mysterious, life was brought withinighty force., Again and again recurreti the ques, tions: "What in the life of this, young woman made her cast aside, her sex and waste her life? What, made her chose to make her life a, lie?", All three of the Illinois women, whom De Raylan claimed as, "wives" are stoutly asserting that, De Raylan was a man. It has,, however been pretty thoroughly es, tablished that De Raylan of Phoenix, and De Ralyan of Chicago are one, and the same person. Two of the, women whom De Raylan took in, marriage are hinting strongly at, substitution and one of them in an, intervew says she scents an insur, ance ptot., However, th\'j statements .of, Charles Tanner, .who had knowij De, Raylan intimately in Chicago, seem, to show beyond all question that the, "wives\' are mistaken in their, statements, De Raylan, the woman,, was the "husband" of these women., A will made by De Raylan has, been found in Chicago in which he, leaves all his property to his Chi, ago "wifo," Mrs. Anna De ,\'Raylan,, and "my beloved son" now a boy of, 13 years. From this document the, Chicago papers have advanced the, theory that De Raylan wasjn really, the mother of the boy of whom he, posed as father. From Russian, sources in the Windy City comes a, remarkable story of an alleged pas, sionate love affair in De Raylan\'s, girlhood, with a Russian Prince,, of, the s-\'cret birth of the bbv and of, the discovery, which drove her from, her home, and to take up life in, this country as a man., These stories are utterly, .discred, ited by the autopsy, which shows, that De Raylan was never a mother, of a child. The following letter,, from Dr. W. C. Rowe, De Raylan\'s, private uhyscian, to Baron Schlip, penbach. the Russian Consul at Chi, cago, touches gn this point,.!, "Phoenix, Arizona, Dec. \'22, 1906., Baron Schippenbach, Chicago,, 111., ."Dear Baron:, I have been delayed in getting, the report you desired because the, jury had not completed its work and, just as soon as it wa handed ttf, me, I sent the telegram., "I heard De Raylan speak \'so, often about you in such cpniplimen-, \' tary language that I feel to be quite, Well acquainted with the Honprpble, \' Russian Baron, the Consul., "considered De Raylan a very, honest, upright, noble gentleman, arid shall forever chbrish the nfem, \'ory "f him I can hardly bring my, self around to say "her," for I only, knew her a3 a man a noble-hearted, man. And there is a noble thing, revealed in the autopsy we physi, cians were satisfied that she was a, perfectly virtuous woman, a virgin., "Why he hid under the disguise, of a man, is more than I can tellj, but that she wanted to keep up the, disguise even in death is evident,, because she told me on one occasion :, "I don\'t care to have my wife come, here to be with me, for she would, be no help tome, but if I am to die, she must come, for we have agreed, (\'promised together\') that if I die, first, she must wash and dress my, body, and if she dies first, I must, wash and dress her., "There will be photographs of, her corpse and probably one will be, sent you., "I am going to Los Angeles from, here, but will be in; Canon City,, Colo., soon., "I was, registered as physician, in Chicago in the year 1883, and, practiced at 1421 Wrightwood av, enue, near Lincoln. I would refer, you to the Hon. Austin 0. Saxtoh., prominent attorney . of Chicago,, whose family I attended. After, practicing there for some years, I, was obliged to go to Pensacola., Fla., on account of having severe, hemorrhages. I can refer you to, the Hon. W. E. Anderson, ex-Mayor, of Pensacola, as to my standing as, a, physician. Two years ago 1 went, to Canon City, Colorado, my pres, ent residence., "Wishing youx everything good,, as he was in the habit of saying, when writing you, I close., "Very respectfully yours,, W. C. Rowe,.", In view of De Raylan\'s will, leav, ing his fortune to his "beloved, son," who can not be his son at all,, comes up the question as to the, identity of the child. Madame An, na De Raylan insists thai she is its, mother and De Raylan its father., It is probable that a legal contro, versy wjll occur over the matter., In view of this and acting upon the, advice of the district attorney. G., P. Driscoll, one of the undertakers, who buried the woman, and who, has claim against her estate, on Sat, uVday applied for letters of admin, stration upon the estate. The hear, ing of the matter will come up be, fore Probate Judge Phillips., In speaking of Madame Anna De, Raylan, who claims to be the moth, er of De Raylan\'s child, Charles, Tanner said that she was a chorus, girl when De Raylan met and mar, red her at about the time of the, Chicago World\'s Fair., A disagreement occurred almost, immediately following the wedding,, and the couple weredivorced. She, married a Chicago man, who soon, died-, and when she and De Raylan, met again the old love sprang anew, into life. De Raylan was a. Greek, Catholic, while the girl was of the, Jewish faith, but such was her love, for De Raylan that she renounced, her own religion and took that of, her lover, the two being married in, the little Greek, church in Center, street! on the West Side, Chicago., "This was in 1902. After they, had been married a considerable, time I went to visit them in their, homeland to all outward appear, ances they were the same as any, other married couple, except that, the\' wife seemed more than ordi, narily fond of her husband. Shortly, after this I leit Chicago, and sav, no more of De Raylan until after, herdeath in Phoenix."., De Raylan undoubtedly expected, to escape general discovery by hav, ing !\'her wife" care for, the body, after death: "Doctor,- you don\'t, understand, why I want my wife., I willtell you a secret. At the, time of, our marriage we entered, into a strange compact. That\' was, which evef of Us shoujd die,, \'the other should be present to wash, the dead body and prepare" it for, burial.", The story that De. Raylan was a, Russian spy is credited by many, here who believe it will finally prove, the real solution of the man\'s mys, terious life. However; there is, nothing among his effects to verify, the story, and Baron Von Schlip, penbach, the Russian consul at Chi, cago, indignantly denies it., Will Test Rights of Japanese, Conferences between Attorney, General Bonaparte and United, States District Attorney Devlin of, San Fancisco, and later between, these gentlemen and Secretary of, State Root, were held today with, view of agreeing upon the govern-, ent\'s statemimt of facts concering, the Japanese school in San Fran, cisco., This statement is to be used in a, test case to determine whether it is, lawful under the treaty with Japan, to separte the races in the s\'chools., By defining the issues it is hoped to, obviate the necessity of taking tes, timony. In this wayjt is expected, an early decsion\' may be had. At, the conclusion of the conference,, Attorney General Bonaparte said an, agreement had not been finally, reached, and further conferences, would be necessary.. In the mean, time, was it announced that nothing, would be given out for publication., Mr. Devlin will remain herj sever, al days., LODGE DIRECTORY., FOUNTAIN LODGE, NO. 15, K.
