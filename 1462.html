Capt.\nEdgar Jadwin, Congressmen Geo.\nF. Burgess and John Garner and\nJudge W. B.

If the\nland has not already been plowed\'\nthe sooner this is done the better.\nPlow deep and follow with the\nharrow, going over the land several\ntimes until the ground is thorough\nly pulverized and made as level as\npossible. Much of the success de\npends on the preparation of the\nsoil. Alfalfa Smith" of Sherman.\nbefore the Farmer\'s Congress stat\ned that in his opinion alfalfa would\ngrow on any soil and in any coun\nty in Texa\'s, and this being the\ncase every farmer should make it a\npoint to plant at least an acre or\ntwo of this valuable feed. We be\nlieve that it is better to broadcast\nthe seed when planting in the fall\nand in drills if planted in the\nspring. Twenty-five pounds o\nseed to tire acre is sufficient. Buy\npure seed, it is not always the\ncheapest that is the most economic\nal. Healthy alfalfa seed has na\nolive green color, dead seed has a\nbrown color, although nil brown\nseed is not dead. If you have time\ntest it by the following method\nwhich is recommended by the Tex\nas experimental station:\n"After having extracted the\nweed seeds, chaff, dirt, etc., from\nthe sample, the remainder should\nbe again mixed aud one hundred\nseeds counted out at random from\nthe pile, in order to test the ger\nminating power. Place these upon\na small piece of clean cotton canton\nflannel or clean blotting paper and\nlay in the bottom of a common\ndinner plate. Wet the whole thor\noughly with luke-warm water aud\ncover with another plate, placing\nin a warm corner of the sitting\nroom or kitchen. After three days\ncount the number of seeds sprouted,\nremoving each as counted. Cover\nagain and repeat the process on\nthe \'sixth day. The sum of the two\ncounts will give the" percentage of\ngerminating seeds. Thus, if at the\nfirst count, the number found\nsprouting be 36, and at the second\n58, the sum 94, indicates that that\nper cent of the seed have germinat\ned, or the sake of accuracy, two.\nplates, each containing one hun\ndred seeds, should be prepared."\nIn planting you should be gov\nerned by conditions, for if the sur\nface is dry the seed should be cov\nered about one inch, at any time it\nis a safe proposition to .plant at\nleast one inch deep.\nAlfalfa should be cut when about\none fourth is in bloom. With a\ngood stand it will yield a ton per\nacre to the cutting and no better\nfeed can be grown on the farm.\nIrrigation Aid.\nINfoticc of Meeting.\nThe annual meeting of the stocky\nholders of the Brownsville and\nGulf Railway Company will be\nheld at the office of the company,\nin Brownsville, Texas, on Thurs\nday, the 21st day of September\n1905, at 10 o\'clock a. m., for the\npurpose of electing directors, and\nthe transaction of such other busi\nness as may be brought before the\nmeeting.\nThe transfer books of the com\npany will be closed at 3 o\'clock p.\nm. on the 20th day of September,\n1905, and will remain closed until\nthree days after the final adjourn\nment of the meeting.\nThe regular annual meeting of\nthe board of directors will be held\nat the same place and on the same\ndate.\nBrownsville, Tex., August 15th,\n1905.

A resolution favoring\nthe adoption of such a stamp will\nbe presented at the meeting. The\nidea is to provide a stamp which\ncould be bought in all countries\nand used for all correspondence\nbetween those countries.\nUnder this plan a firm in New\nYork could, by put chasing one of\nthese stamps, provide return post\nage for a correspondent in Europe\nwithout the bother and expense of\npurchasing the stamp issued by\nthe European country. He could\nalso remit small amounts in stamps\nto his foreign correspondents,\nsending a stamp which could be\nused by the correspondent at any\ntime.\nThe idea of the international\npostage stamp has many attractive\nadvantages and no disadvantages\nhas as yet appeared, except such\nas could be quickly overcome by\ncompletion of arragements between\nthe various countries in the Postal\nUnion.
