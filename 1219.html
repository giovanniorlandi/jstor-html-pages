Then there \nwas a recess, generated by weariness from prolonged \nwar or conservative backlash (depending on the \nobserver’s viewpoint), when portentous court de\xad\ncisions presaged the civil rights movement, but the \nconsensus needed to support public social services \nwas elusive. This was followed by the explosion of \nthe 1960’s, which produced the largest array of social \nwelfare measures the nation had ever seen.\nThis article focuses on housing and urban develop\xad\nment, employment and manpower, and health care \nand nutrition. Of course, public programs are subject \nto constraints that make orderly program develop\xad\nment unlikely. The progressive delays in Congress \nthat pile up hundreds of bills toward the end of ses\xad\nsions, the fragmentation of problems resulting from \nassigning bits and pieces to various congressional com\xad\nmittees and federal agencies, the unpredictable rise \nand fall of appropriations, and the two extremes of \nbureaucratic behavior—the crash approach or the \nfoot-dragging myopic stance—as agencies develop \nguidelines for program sponsors, all contribute to the \nfailure of programs that might succeed with fewer \nhandicaps. Whether public or private, local, state, or \nfederal ventures experience these difficulties more \noften is an open question in social welfare. Because \nthe federal government has assumed more responsi\xad\n1 Henry J. Aaron, Shelter and Subsidies (Washington, \nD.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1972), Chapter IV. By \ncontrast, Aaron estimates that federal, state, and local gov\xad\nernments paid only $1.4 billion for welfare housing in 1966.\nbility in recent years, the searchlight has naturally \nturned in that direction.\nHOUSING AN D  URBAN RENEWAL\nFederal housing and urban renewal policy is di\xad\nrected to three goals: renewing blighted urban areas, \nsubsidizing low and moderate cost housing, and in\xad\nitiating tax policy that will subsidize home ownership. \nThe United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment is responsible for urban renewal and for \na variety of subsidies for public housing and the re\xad\nhabilitation, rental, or purchase of single and multi\xad\nfamily dwellings. The United States Department of \nHealth, Education, and Welfare, through the public \nassistance grants-in-aid, shares the cost with states \nand some counties for housing welfare families. The \nmost expensive subsidies of all, the tax shelters for \nhomeowners which account for about $7 billion yearly \nin foregone taxes, are administered by the Internal \nRevenue Service.1 Only rarely are these programs \nconsidered together, as decisions are made to improve \none or scuttle another.\nBy the end of World War II, the nation had hous\xad\ning needs accumulated in two decades of neglect. \nThe dislocation that marked the end of the war, the \nbaby boom, and the waves of migration from rural \nareas to small towns and on to urban centers, and \nfro'm the south to eastern and western seacoasts and \nthe Great Lakes region, immeasurably complicated \nthe problem. In 1944, the federal government took \nsteps to guarantee low interest loans so that veterans \ncould purchase homes, and in 1949 the National \nHousing Act was passed to facilitate and encourage \nhousing construction and to refurbish urban slums. \nThese goals were to be achieved in partnership with \nprivate enterprise and city and state governments. \nCities, for instance, originated plans for urban re-\n15\n", "16 C U R R EN T  H IST O R Y , JU L Y , 1973\nnewal and spelled out what was to be demolished or \nrehabilitated, what new community facilities were \nneeded, the planned mix of private and public con\xad\nstruction, and time and cost schedules. The federal \ngovernment approved the plans, compensated relo\xad\ncated families and, through loans and direct grants, \nsubsidized a good share of net project costs.2\nPublic housing, too, was initiated by localities. \n(This is the chief reason sites were so difficult to find.) \nThe federal government financed the planning and \ndevelopmental phase through loans and, when projects \nwere sufficiently advanced, Local Housing Authorities \nsold tax-exempt bonds to private investors, with fed\xad\neral guarantee of the full cost of principal and in\xad\nterest. In 1969, Irving H. Welfeld estimated that \nthe annual federal subsidy for each public housing \nunit was about $1,500.3\nThe National Housing Act was amended frequently. \nIn addition to urban renewal and public housing, the \nmost important features of national housing policy \nwere FHA mortgage insurance designed to protect \nlenders against loss from default by borrowers, several \nmajor credit institutions intended to increase the flow \nof credit to housing,4 various interest rate subsidies \nfor moderate income housing, and rent supplements \nintroduced during the 1960’s in behalf of poor fami\xad\nlies.\nWhile most people were better housed in 1960 and \n1970 than they were in 1950, this was chiefly due to \nthe private construction of suburban homes and the \nresettlement of the urban poor in the homes vacated \nby the new suburbanites. The 1949 law contemplated\n810,000 new public housing units by 1955, thus \nmarkedly stepping up the earlier pace, but by 1970, \nonly 750,000 new units had been completed in three \ndecades, as contrasted with 35 million private dwell\xad\nings. By 1965, about 1,700 urban renewal projects, \nthus far costing $6.1 billion (about 50 per cent from \nfederal funds), had destroyed more homes than all \ndirect federal subsidies helped build. Typically, they \nwere replaced by office buildings, hotels, and expensive\n2 For detailed explanations of programs, sec Aaron, op. cit.,\nBernard J.

The \nrehabilitation of sound but old housing lagged far \nbehind.5 By that time, too, urban renewal was being \ndubbed Negro Removal. Sixty per cent of all dis\xad\nplaced families were black.\nSubsidized low interest rates, insured loans, and \nlonger-term mortgages primarily helped moderate \nincome families, because they were far better credit \nrisks than the very poor. Studies showed that fewer \nthan 10 per cent of the purchasers of FHA-insured \nhomes had incomes below $6,000. The rent supple\xad\nment program held more promise for the poor, but \nwas only a small share of the total thrust.\nURBAN PROBLEMS CREATED\nExperts have observed that federal housing policy \ncreated the urban problem. Certainly it contributed \nto the phenomenon of crowded black inner cities \nbanded by a Berlin Wall of suburbs. From 1939 to \n1950, federal regulations and insurance practices \nstrongly favored the economic and racial homogeneity \nof urban neighborhoods, just as they facilitated the \ngovernment-insured construction of white middle- \nincome suburbs. In 1950, two years after the United \nStates Supreme Court outlawed restrictive covenants, \nfederal administrative policy finally shifted to en\xad\ncourage integration, but translation of that policy into \npractice was another matter. By Executive Order, \nin 1962, President John F. Kennedy ruled that no \nfederal assistance was available for housing that dis\xad\ncriminated on the basis of race. But by that time de \nfacto segregation was the pattern in metropolitan \nareas, and issues of land use, taxation, jobs, poverty, \npolitical control, transportation, and racism were so \nemotionally laden and intertwined as to defy simple \nsolutions.\nPublic housing and urban renewal were often \nscored for their indifference to the human dimension. \nUntil the 1960’s few' resettlement costs were reim\xad\nbursed, and local authorities paid more attention to \nphysical than human problems. Public housing was \nalmost predictably located in neighborhoods with in\xad\nsufficient schools, churches, shopping centers, recrea\xad\ntional, health, transportation, and employment re\xad\nsources. Three federal laws tried to correct these \ndeficiencies; the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth \nOffense Control Act of 1961, the Economic Oppor\xad\ntunity Act of 1964, and the Model Cities Act of 1966. \nAll sought to involve local residents in planning for \nneighborhood improvement and new services to pro\xad\nvide jobs and job training and to develop skills in \nnegotiation when neighborhood needs were persis\xad\ntently ignored. But all three w'ere too modestly fi\xad\nnanced to assure, enduring improvements. Nor did \nthey succeed notably in changing the style among \nestablished agencies from one of competition to col\xad\nlaboration. More seriously, almost from their in\xad\n", 'Federal Social Welfare Programs: 1945-1968 •  17\nception, all three were under the threat of being cut \nback or dismantled.0\nConversely, tax shelters for homeowners were \nrarely questioned, although they were far more ex\xad\npensive. The homeowner has advantages over rent\xad\ners and other investors. If he were treated like other \ninvestors, he would include the rent he could have \nobtained were he not living in his house in his gross \nincome-—just as investors add dividends or capital \ngains to arrive at their gross income. Then the home- \nowner would take deductions for maintenance, de\xad\npreciation, mortgage interest and property taxes, all \nas expenses in earning his rental income. The dif\xad\nference, or net rent, would become a portion of his \ntaxable income.\nInstead, he merely deducts mortgage interest and \nproperty taxes from his gross income from other \nsources. Thus, his taxable income is below that of \nother investors and, of course, of people who rent. \nLike so many federal subsidies, these, too, increase in \nvalue as the cost of housing increases, and this cost in \nturn tends to rise with family income. The poor can \nrarely afford to purchase homes, and so they rarely \nbenefit from these tax windfalls. Until the complex \ninterrelationships and impacts of housing and urban \npolicy are considered simultaneously, solutions will \ncontinue to be elusive.\nEMPLOYMENT AN D  MANPOW ER PROGRAMS\nDuring World War II, at the height of the pro\xad\nductive effort which sustained the war and civilian \nconsumption both here and abroad, the unemploy\xad\nment rate fell to 1.2 per cent, the lowest level since \n1906. Anticipating a sharp reversal at the end of the \nwar, a coalition of veterans’ organizations, labor \nunions and grateful citizens brought about the passage \nof the G.I. Bill of Rights. In the following six years, \nalmost half the young men and women who had \nserved in the armed forces took advantage of its \neducational benefits. This measure temporarily re\xad\nstrained the growth of the labor force and upgraded \nthe competence of veterans, but there was no con\xad\nsensus for long-term efforts to bring about better \ncoordination—numerically or qualitatively—between\n6 Sar A.

The best that \ncould be achieved was the Full Employment Act of \n1946, with its paper promise of a job for every Ameri\xad\ncan who was able and willing to work.\nDuring the following years, there were successive \nbusiness cycles climaxing in the recession of 1957- \n1958, when 20 per cent of the labor force was esti\xad\nmated to be working shorter hours or experiencing \nperiods of unemployment.6 7 With each recovery \nduring those years, unemployment rates failed to drop \nto pre-recession levels, and the concept of “full em\xad\nployment” became an upwardly shifting artifact. \nWhether the economy receded or advanced, youths, \nminority groups, women and elderly workers were \nseverely handicapped in competing for jobs. Typi\xad\ncally, they were the last hired and the first fired, and \ntoo often they could find no decent jobs.\nThe breakthrough was precipitated by the Soviet \nUnion’s success in launching Sputnik. The immediate \nresponse was the National Defense Education Act of \n1958, which sought to increase and update the sup\xad\nply of teachers, especially in mathematics and related \nsciences. As the civil rights movement gained mo\xad\nmentum, attention turned to less favored occupations. \nAs a result, Garth Magnum noted, in the next decade \nthe nation built a $2-billion manpower policy almost \nfrom scratch.8\nThe new manpower policy was a three-pronged \napproach. There was the effort to revitalize dis\xad\ntressed regions like Appalachia, where joblessness \nand isolation were the dominant themes.\nA second and larger thrust aimed to upgrade the \nsupply of labor to fit demand. The Manpower De\xad\nvelopment and Training Act (MDTA) of 1962, the \nmarked rise in appropriations for vocational education \nbeginning in 1963, and the Economic Opportunity \nAct of 1964 exemplify this approach. Initially, older \nworkers in declining industries were the favored bene\xad\nficiaries, but the War on Poverty dramatized the \nneglect of disadvantaged youths, and gradually pro\xad\ngrams veered in that direction.\nEmployable older youths and adults were offered \nremedial education, vocational instruction and on- \nthe-job training. Some programs, like MDTA, were \ncarried out in communities where the participants \nnormally lived. Others, like the Job Corps, reflected \na total immersion philosophy. Youths were removed \nfrom neighborhood and family influences and trans\xad\nported to urban and rural residential centers where \nthey engaged in year-long vocational preparation for \na variety of occupations. There were community \naction projects in rural and urban slums, migrant \nlabor camps, and Indian reservations, where new \ncommunity services provided employment.9\nOther programs, like College Work-Study and the \nNeighborhood Youth Corps (NYC), encouraged \nyouths to remain in school. Both provided funds for\n', "18 •  C U R R E N T  H ISTO R Y , JU L Y , 1973\npart-time employment, and the latter also financed \nthousands of summer jobs for inner-city youths and \nsome year-round jobs for school dropouts.10 1\nThen there was a welfare-related work and training \nprogram for employable adults receiving welfare, a \ngroup that was often by-passed as other programs \n“creamed” the more promising applicants. In 1967, \nthis program was succeeded by the Work Incentive \nProgram, a very similar effort incorporated into the \nSocial Security Act and still flourishing, despite \nalmost consistent reports of poor cost benefits.11\nThe third thrust was to improve the employment \nagencies that played such vital roles in connecting job \nseekers with jobs. Traditionally, the hard-to-place \npoor, young and unskilled workers received short \nshrift in this quarter, as agencies and their personnel \ncompeted for the best placement records. The ques\xad\ntion was whether they cou'.d now perform better, or \nwhether new solutions were necessary. Of those tried, \nthe Concentrated Employment Program, with its in\xad\ndividualized services delivered through 80 urban \nprojects, probably best clarified the complexity of \nthe task of opening up new jobs and achieving a \npromising fit between the individual and the job.\nThese new manpower training and job creation \nefforts, taken together, reached about 1.3 million peo\xad\nple by 1969. NYC and MDTA were numerically the \nmost important. But even in prosperous 1966, with \na war in progress in Indochina, there were 2.5 million \nunemployed in the civilian labor force of 75 million; \nthere were uncounted others, manpower specialists \nagreed, who no longer shov/ed up in official reports.\nEven though manpower policy resulted in minus\xad\ncule programs, considering the need, and although \nprograms suffered from fragmentation, overlap and \ngaps, the competition between old and new approaches \nhelped to renew the old approaches and to highlight \nthe need for national, integrated and comprehensive\n10 “The Effectiveness of Manpower Training Programs: \nA Review of the Research on the Impact on the Poor,” \nStudies in Public Welfare, Paper No. 3, A Staff Study pre\xad\npared for the Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy, Joint Eco\xad\nnomic Committee, 92nd Cong.. 2d ss., November 20, 1972.\n11 See, e.g., Poverty amid Plenty, Report of the Presi\xad\ndent’s Commission on Income Maintenance Programs \n(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,\n1969) ; Work in America, Report of a Special Task Force \nto the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Cam\xad\nbridge: MIT Press, 1973), pp. 167-171; Gilbert Y.

Experience in \nthe 1960’s also demonstrated that on-the-job training \nwas far more rewarding than vocational classroom in\xad\nstruction. But the chief trouble was unsolved. There \nwas a crying need for more jobs. It made little sense \nfrom any point of view to pretend that improving \nthe skills of the unemployed and under-employed \nwould guarantee them jobs if no suitable jobs existed. \nThe challenge was to stabilize the economy at much \nlower levels of unemployment, and to assure a grow\xad\ning supply of jobs. This could be done, preferably, \nby creating and providing long-term support for \ngreatly needed, overdue public services jobs.\nHEALTH CARE A N D  NUTRITION\nPrior to World War II, federal health activities \nwere essentially limited to grants to states for com\xad\nmunicable disease control and environmental sanita\xad\ntion, plus special provisions for federal beneficiaries \nlike veterans, dependents of members of the armed \nservices, merchant seamen and American Indians.\nIn the years following the war, the health care \ncapacity of the nation and the federal government’s \nrole in health care were revolutionized. New con\xad\ncepts of social and physical rehabilitation emerged \nfrom dramatic achievements of medicine in restoring \nwounded soldiers, disfigured Japanese victims of the \natomic bomb, and severely disabled coal miners in \nColorado and Appalachia. Wartime techniques of \ndecision-making brought about great advances in data \nprocessing and analysis, eventually paving the way \nfor the National Health Survey initiated in the mid- \n1950’s.12\nInsightful social scientists rediscovered an old idea \n—investment in human resources; in so doing they \ncalled attention to the enormous social and economic \ncosts of poverty, malnutrition, ill-health and chronic \ndisability. And a new breed of social economists \nbegan measuring the economic value of advances in \nlife expectancy, improved control over infectious and \nacute diseases, and the general rise in levels of health.13\nIn 1946, Congress passed the Hill-Burton Act to \nprovide federal aid for hospital construction and, with \na series of laws, began building the great national \nresearch effort which became the National Institutes \nof Health. In the same year, the National Mental \nHealth Act presaged the federal government’s partner\xad\nship in the creation of a national network of com\xad\nmunity mental health clinics and the training of \nnecessary personnel.\nIn 1950, severe disability became one of the \ncovered risks in the federal social security system; for \npersons who could not qualify, a new public assistance \ncategory was developed: Aid to the Permanently and \nTotally Disabled. Both provided regular cash pay\xad\nments to mitigate the catastrophic loss of family in\xad\ncome occasioned by disabling injury and illness. In\n", 'Federal Social Welfare Programs: 1945-1968 •  19\nthe same year, the federal government began to re\xad\nimburse states for modest medical expenses incurred \nby families receiving welfare.\nBut as in other social welfare areas, the remarkable \ngains were reserved for the 1960’s. Throughout the \npostwar years, opposing groups in Congress had de\xad\nbated successive health care bills. In 1965, this strug\xad\ngle culminated in two dozen pieces of legislation that \nradically redefined the federal role in health matters. \nThe programs popularly known as Medicare and \nMedicaid were chief among them.14\nMedicare (Title XVIII of the Social Security Act) \nprovided both hospital and medical insurance for \npersons 65 years and older. All enrollees were in\xad\nsured for limited hospital care and extended care, as \nin nursing homes, and for home health care when \nprescribed by physicians following a period of hos\xad\npitalization. They could also elect medical insurance \n(if they paid half the premium cost) to cover charges \nby physicians and to cover various medical services \nand supplies. The law specified a list of deductibles, \ninitial expenses chargeable to patients when they \nentered hospitals or used other program benefits.15\nMedicaid (Title XIX of the Social Security Act) \nsought to extend the program to all medically needy \npersons, especially children, in the hope that by the \nmid-1970’s no one would be denied adequate health \ncare because of poverty. Thus, public assistance \ngrants-in-aid became the channel for reimbursing \nstates for specified hospital and medical costs incurred \nby low-income families.16 17\nThe nation’s expenditures for health and illness \nnearly trebled in the 1960’s. By 1969, they amounted \nto more than $60 billion, almost 7 per cent of the \ngross national product. Public expenditures from the \nSocial Security trust fund and from the general \nrevenues of federal, state and local government ac\xad\ncounted for 37 per cent of the total. Moreover, the \nroles of the federal government and states and locali\xad\n14 Peter A.

Two-thirds of government outlays \ncame from federal funds by 1969, whereas the lesser \njurisdictions had carried over half of the burden in \n1950 and 1960.\nBut by late 1968 the health care system of the \nnation was in serious trouble. Federal programs were \ncomplex reimbursement devices with precious few \ncontrols and little power to improve the quality or \ndistribution of services. Medical care continued to be \nmore of a “cottage industry” of individual practition\xad\ners—increasingly specialists—than a modem, effective \nand efficient health care system. The question was \nwhether the nation could long afford to support the \nsame level of care unless the delivery system was \nbasically revamped.11\nEmphasis on health care inevitably drew attention \nto hunger and malnutrition. For years, experts had \nworried about the failure of the United States to keep \npace with other industrial nations in reducing infant \nmortality rates. In the early 1960’s, studies were \nmade of hunger in various poverty areas, especially \nin the southern states.18 One result was a searching \nscrutiny of food programs authorized in prior years by, \nthe federal government, such as the Donated Food or \nSurplus Commodity program initiated in the 1930’s \nas part of the government’s price support efforts, the \n1946 National School Lunch program, and the Special \nMilk program of 1954.\nOnly a casual glance was necessary to realize that \nthese programs reached few people, considering their \npotential; they were very low on the list of priorities \nof the United States Department of Agriculture, \nwhich was the federal administrative agency; and they \nwere replete with regulations and bureaucratic be\xad\nhavior that the poor beneficiaries regarded as onerous, \nrestrictive, whimsical, inequitable and demeaning.19\nHowever, some gains were made even in this touchy \narea. In 1964, the Food Stamp Act was passed. \nUnder this program, poor families paid a fixed \namount each month, as determined by net income, for \nstamps redeemable at food stores for something more \nthan they cost. The difference, or bonus, was financed \nby the federal government. The stamps could only \nbe used for food, not for laundry, paper, sanitary, or \nother products that all families need. Furthermore, \namong the very poor, food is often the most flexible \nitem in the family budget, and many found it im\xad\npossible to spend upward of 30 per cent of their \nincome for this one purpose.\nThe various federal food programs served 5.3 mil- \n(Continued on page 39)\nWinifred Bell is Co-Director of the Center for Stud\xad\nies in Income Maintenance Policy and professor at the \nGraduate School of Social Work, New York Univer\xad\nsity.

Roosevelt brought his TERA \nexperience to the presidency and applied it on a na\xad\ntional scale. The programs of the New Deal period \nand especially the Social Security Act of 1935, as one \nhistorian has noted, “marked a decisive transfer of \nwelfare functions from voluntary to public institu\xad\ntions, and from the local to the federal level, thus \npaving the way for contemporary anti-poverty pro\xad\ngrams.” The New Deal, in short, permanently altered \nsocial welfare practice in the United States.23\n23 Lubovc, Struggle for Social Security, p. 179.\nWELFARE IN THE NEW DEAL ERA\n(Continued from page 14)\ntubes. Jobless engineers went to their drawing boards \nto plan additional projects; WPA dentists and doctors \nministered to their co-workers; athletes manned \nrecreation projects; WPA teachers staffed classrooms \nfor nursery schoolers and the elderly alike; vaudeville \ntroupes soft-shoed before audiences at CCC camps; \nan all-Negro cast performed Macbeth (setting the \nplay not in Scotland but in the Caribbean) ; and \nWPA braille experts cared for the blind.12\nDuring the 1930’s, the national government’s wel\xad\nfare role undeniably changed. Only a little more \nthan a decade before Roosevelt’s arrival, in the Shep- \npart-Towner Act of 1921, Congress had appropriated \nthe pecksniffian sum of $1,000,000 to promote the \nhealth of mothers and infants: for the first time, \nWashington had provided money for a welfare pur\xad\npose. In contrast, the WPA alone spent more than \n$10 billion, an amount which supporters of the hotly \ndebated Sheppard-Towner Act would have found \ntoo staggering to comprehend. But the test of money \nalone could not fairly measure the shift that had \ntaken place: the notion that voluntary philanthropy \nand local initiative could sustain the poor had been \nreplaced by a new pyramid of intergovernmental re\xad\nlationships with Washington at the apex.\nAt the same time, the antipoverty prejudice which \nhad accumulated over generations was by no means \ncompletely removed in the depression decade. While \nwaxing euphoric over the spectacle of a single day \nin the life of WPA, we can easily lose sight of the fact \nthat for every person on the federal payroll, at least \nfour had been denied relief. The Great Depression, \noutrunning Washington’s fiscal capacity, also out\xad\ndistanced congressional willingness to spend indef\xad\ninitely. Worried that a pariah class of chronic de12\nFederal Works Agency, Final Report, pp. 59-71, 131 — \n133. and The New York Times, miscellaneous issues, 1936- \n1940.\npendents was being created, congressional conserva\xad\ntives succeeded in paring WPA before the economy \nhad recovered. When, in 1939, Congress trimmed \nWPA appropriations, toughened eligibility rules, and \nscuttled the WPA’s Federal Theatre Project, the legis\xad\nlature was trading upon attitudes endemic at the \nlocal level throughout the New Deal years.\nAnd it is precisely the nation’s behavior at the \nlocal level that must qualify any assertion that the \n1930’s effected a welfare revolution. Despite mixed \nevidence of both cooperation and recalcitrance, in\xad\ntergovernmental relationships posed major difficul\xad\nties: state-municipal and state-municipal-federal ten\xad\nsions remained acute. So, too, did local political and \nethnic rivalries.\nIn the meantime, most of the nation’s newspapers \nregaled readers with stories of welfare failures, while \naccomplishments went virtually unnoticed. Local \nvendettas against welfare “grafters,” conducted in \ncity after city, tended to stigmatize all relief recip\xad\nients. Distraught property owners watched local tax \nbills increase. Indeed, the shrill cries against spend\xad\ning, more evident in local than in national politics, \nindicated the fragility of middle class commitment to \nwelfare and curbed the expansion of local relief in \nthe 1935-1940 period.\nLocal standards, in fact, remained at such a \ngrindingly low level that in 1937 one of the best- \nfinanced municipal welfare systems in the nation paid \nmore to feed and maintain a parks department horse \nthan it allotted to a family of four. Under the cir\xad\ncumstances, it is astonishing that the New Deal man\xad\naged as well as it did. Its achievements, however, \nwere relative.\nFEDERAL PROGRAMS: 1945-1968  \n(Continued from page 19)\nlion persons in October, 1964, and 7 million in the \nfall of 1967, but participation was still low, and one- \nthird of the poorest counties in the nation had neither \nfood stamps nor Donated Foods as late as 1968. \nDuring that year, court suits were filed in 27 states to \nforce the United States Department of Agriculture to \ninstitute corrective action.20 The department com\xad\nplained that since all of its food programs depended \non state and local school board option, its hands were \neffectively tied.\nOther groups insisted that setting a decent income \nf.oor below all families and individuals in the nation \nv/as the first order of business, and that at the very\n20 Hunger U.S.A.

Their agents learned that poverty and \ndependency were not, for the most part, expressions \nof individual moral perversity but were rather the \nresult of faulty social and economic conditions over \nwhich the needy had little or no control. All the \ncharacter regeneration in the world, for example, \ncould not help the hundreds of thousands of labor\xad\ners thrown out of work during the depression of the \n1890’s.\nAlso, since the organized charities insisted upon \ngathering the facts and keeping detailed records, they \nunwittingly compiled comprehensive data on the \nsocial and economic problems of the poor, the real \npoverty-producing factors that had little to do with \ncharacter—ill health, premature death of the family \nbreadwinner, industrial accidents, low wages, invol\xad\nuntary unemployment, and so on. Traditional no\xad\ntions about the poor had to be discarded, or at least \nseriously reconsidered. A number of scholarly studies \nshowed that poverty and dependency resulted in most \ncases from social and economic causes rather than \nfrom personal inadequacy.15\n15 Amos Warner, American Charities: A Study in Phi\xad\nlanthropy and Economics (New York: Crowell, 1894). \nAlso see Robert Hunter, Poverty (New York: Macmillan, \n1904), a study that not only reached pretty much the same \nconclusions as Warner’s but demonstrated that the COS \napproach did not work; according to Hunter, at least ten \ntnillion Americans, or one out of every eight, were still \npoor after the turn of the century—more than 25 years \nafter the movement began. Also see Dorothy G. Becker, \n“Exit Lady Bountiful: The Volunteer and the Professional \nSocial Worker,” Social Service Review, Vol. 38 (March. \n1964), 57-72; Gary A. Lloyd, Charities, Settlements, and \nSocial Work: An Inquiry into Philosophy and Method, \n1890-1915 (New Orleans: Tulane University School of \nSocial Work, 1971); Bremner, “Scientific Philanthropy,” \n172-73.\n16 See Allen F. Davis, Spearheads for Reform: The Social \nSettlements and the Progressive Movement (New York: \nOxford University Press, 1967).\nBy the turn of the century, then, the organized \ncharities began to broaden their efforts. They be\xad\ngan to provide material relief to the needy. And \nthey also engaged in a variety of other activities— \nhousing reform, public health work, juvenile courts, \nprobation and legal aid, publication of reform- \noriented journals, founding of training schools for \ncharity workers—which, if they were not aimed at \naltering the social and economic order, at least sought \nto mitigate some of its worst effects.\nMeanwhile, other developments, including the ap\xad\npearance of settlement houses in the nation’s larger \ncities, were leading in the same direction.16 And as \nthe complex of problems associated with rapid in\xad\ndustrialization, urbanization and immigration re\xad\nsulted in even more rather than less deprivation and \ninsecurity, a growing number of reformers saw the \nneed for more public assistance. The magnitude of \nthe task, they felt, called for more monetary support \nthan private agencies could command. Moreover, \nsince poverty was a social, not an individual, matter, \nmore public intervention and aid was not only neces\xad\nsary but just.\nPRIVATE CHARITY \nIN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n(Continued from page 32) \nproach that no substantial changes were broached \nfor ten years, while most changes which have been \nintroduced during the past ten years have met with \nwidespread public resistance.\nMany of the leaders recruited for federal and state \npublic assistance programs received their training \nin private agencies, private universities, or both. \nThe principal textbook was Mary Richmond’s Social \nDiagnosis, with its precise prescriptions for investiga\xad\ntions and social studies coming out of pre-World War \nI family welfare experience. Within the new govern\xad\nment agencies, Miss Hoey placed great emphasis on \nanother practice derived from private agency experi\xad\nence—in-service training and close supervision of \nworkers in individual conferences. Thus the influence \nof the private agencies from the 1920’s, exerted by \nmeans of education and manpower recruitment, has \ncontinued down to the very recent past.\nCITIZEN CONCERN\nIn private social welfare, there has also been a \nthread of individual and social concern. Private \norganizations have tried to bring together the con\xad\ncerns of many people for their more effective expres\xad\nsion on a continuing basis. Through agencies, the \nfinancial and volunteer service of many individuals \ncan be pooled to achieve sustained pressure.\nTraditionally, in this country such organizations \nhave been local in nature; the relief societies, settle\xad\n']</pre>
