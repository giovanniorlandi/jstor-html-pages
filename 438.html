Recently, climatological studies report observational\nevidence of changes in the timing of the seasons, such\nas earlier timing of the annual cycle of surface temperature,\nearlier snow melt and earlier onset of the phenological spring\nseason. Also hydrological studies report earlier timing and\nchanges in monthly streamflows. From a water resources\nmanagement perspective, there is a need to quantitatively describe\nthe variability in the timing of hydrological regimes\nand to understand how climatic changes control the seasonal\nwater budget of river basins.\nHere, the timing of hydrological regimes from 1930–2009\nwas investigated in a network of 27 river gauges in Saxony/Germany\nthrough a timing measure derived by harmonic\nfunction approximation of annual periods of runoff ratio series.\nThe timing measure proofed to be robust and equally\napplicable to both mainly pluvial river basins and snow melt\ndominated regimes.\nWe found that the timing of runoff ratio is highly variable,\nbut markedly coherent across the basins analysed. Differences\nin average timing are largely explained by basin eleva-\ntion. Also the magnitude of low frequent changes in the seasonal\ntiming of streamflow and the sensitivity to the changes\nin the timing of temperature increase with basin elevation.\nThis sensitivity is in turn related to snow storage and release,\nwhereby snow cover dynamics in late winter explain a large\npart of the low- and high-frequency variability.\nA trend analysis based on cumulative anomalies revealed\na common structural break around the year 1988. While the\ntiming of temperature shifted earlier by 4 days, accompanied\nby a temperature increase of 1 K, the timing of runoff ratio\nCorrespondence to: M.

This accelerated and distinct change indicates,\nthat impacts of climate change on the water cycle may be\nstrongest in higher, snow melt dominated basins.\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Motivation\nIn nival and pluvial catchments and river basins of Central\nEurope (CE) we observe a variable but distinct seasonal hydrological\nregime. This hydrological regime is a result of\nseveral processes induced by meteorological forcing and the\nproperties of the receiving catchments. Looking at the water\nbalance of typical basins in CE, precipitation has a small seasonal\ncycle compared to its variation and would alone not ac-\ncount for the distinctive seasonality of runoff. This is mainly\nintroduced by basin evapotranspiration, resulting in lower\nflows during summer and early autumn. Also at catchments\nat higher elevations, snow accumulation and snow melt produce\nhigher flows in late winter and early spring. Besides\nthe local climate, catchment properties such as water storage\nin soils, evaporative demand of vegetation and human water\nmanagement moderate the resulting hydrological regime.\nWater resources management has to deal with the seasonality\nof hydrological regimes. Generally demand and wa-\nter availability are out of phase, i.e. when the availability of\nwater is lowest (summer) the demand is highest. This pressure\non water delivery systems increases the need to correctly\nestimate the seasonality of hydrological processes (Loucks\net al., 2005). Still, it is common practise to assume stationarity\nof monthly statistics and thus stationarity of the whole\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n', '1820 M. Renner and C. Bernhofer: Variability of the annual hydrological regime\nannual cycle in design studies for water resources management.\nHowever, there is increasing evidence for changes\nin the timing of the seasons from various disciplines. Earlier\nstreamflow timing and snow melt have been reported\ne.g. by Stewart et al. (2005); Déry et al. (2009); Stahl et al.\n(2010). Further, phenological studies provide evidence of\nearlier spring season, e.g. Dose and Menzel (2004). Based\non station and gridded data of surface temperature, Thomson\n(1995) and Stine et al. (2009) found tendencies of advanced\nseasonal timing.\nConsequently, there is a need to estimate the timing of hydrological\nregimes, its variability and to check for long term\nchanges, which could possibly violate the stationarity assumption\nof the annual cycle of hydrologic records. Further-\nmore, the sensitivity of the timing of hydrological regimes\nto changes in the phase of temperature needs to be assessed.\nThis is especially important when considering the regional\nimpacts of climate and land use change.\n1.2 Seasonal changes in hydrologic records\nHydrological studies concerned with changes in streamflow\nwithin regions throughout CE usually analyse annual runoff\nand seasonal changes by monthly data (KLIWA, 2003; Fiala,\n2008; Stahl et al., 2010). The majority of annual flow\nrecords in CE do not show significant trends, but spatially\ncoherent trends in separate months have been reported. Remarkable\nis that positive streamflow trends have been found\nin winter months, which are followed by negative trends in\nspring (Stahl et al., 2010). Mostly it is concluded that these\ntrends are a result of warmer winters which in turn lead to\nan earlier onset of snow melt. Mote et al. (2005) emphasise\nthat the natural storage of water in snow affects greater water\nvolumes than any human made reservoir and thus changes in\nsnow pack directly affect river runoff.\nThere is a range of measures that can be used to directly\nestimate the timing of annual streamflow regimes, such as\nthe timing of the annual maximum, the fraction of annual\ndischarge in a given month or half flow dates (Court, 1962;\nHodgkins et al., 2003; Regonda et al., 2005; Stewart et al.,\n2005). Even though these measures are relatively simple and\neasily understood, these metrics are only useful for hydrological\nregimes with distinct seasonality such as those dom-\ninated by snowmelt. Déry et al. (2009) note that synoptic\nevents, e.g. warm spells in winter or late season precipitation\nmay dominate such measures rather than long term changes\nin climate.\nRelatively few studies have studied changes in the variability\nof the annual cycle, being the strongest signal in many\nclimate records at mid to high latitudes (Huybers and Curry,\n2006). By using a harmonic representation of the annual cycle,\nthis variability has been studied for long records of sur-\nface temperatures (Thomson, 1995; Stine et al., 2009) and\nprecipitation (Thompson, 1999). The resulting annual phases\nand amplitudes describe the timing of the annual cycle and its\nrange based on the whole cycle instead of considering each\nmonth separately.\n1.3 Regional climate in Saxony\nThe Free State of Saxony is situated at the south-eastern border\nof Germany, covering an area of 18 413 km2. In this study\n27 river basins within Saxony have been analysed, which\nall belong to the Elbe River system. The climate is characterised\nby two main factors. First, there is a transition of\nthe maritime western European climate to the continental climate\nof eastern Europe, which leads to a temperate warm\nand humid climate with cool winters and warm summers.\nSecond, there is an orographic influence due to the mountain\nranges at the southern border with elevations gradually\nincreasing from 100 m up to 1200 m. Recently, the climate\nand observed trends have been described in detail by Bernhofer\net al. (2008) and summarised by Franke et al. (2009).\nFrom the observed changes they deduce that climate change\neffects are more pronounced in Saxony than in other regions\nin Germany. They report long term shifts in observed global\nradiation and dependent variables such as potential evapotranspiration.\nThese phenomena, also known as global dim-\nming and brightening (Wild et al., 2005), have been very pronounced\nin Saxony due to reduced industrial and domestic\nemissions after German unification in 1990. Also with regard\nto air pollution, especially the ridge region of the Ore\nMountains has been severely effected by tree die-off since\nthe 1960s peaking in the 1980s (Kubelka et al., 1993; Fanta,\n1997). With regard to precipitation Bernhofer et al. (2008)\nobserved a positive trend in the number of droughts during\ngrowing season, combined with intensified heavy precipitation.\nThese effects are partly compensated at the annual level\nby increased winter precipitation. However, at the same time\nwinter snow depth and snow cover duration decreased, highlighting\nthe effects of increasing temperatures especially dur-\ning winter and spring.\n1.4 Objective and structure\nThe objectives of this paper are (1) to derive a climatology\nof the timing of the annual hydrological regimes for a range\nof river basins throughout Saxony; (2) to evaluate their interdecadal\nvariability and trends; and (3) to determine the prox-\nimal processes governing the locally coherent patterns of the\nobserved changes in timing.\nTo resolve these issues, a reliable measure for the timing,\napplicable for different hydrological regimes is needed. So\ninstead of using streamflow records directly, we employ the\nbasin runoff ratio, the ratio of discharge and basin precipitation.\nThe emphasised seasonal fluctuation of runoff ra-\ntio is a direct measure of seasonal water availability and as\nbeing a normalisation, it makes different basins more comparable.\nThe series of monthly runoff ratio are filtered for\ntheir annual periodicity by the harmonic method described\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1819–1833, 2011 www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1819/2011/\n', 'M. Renner and C. Bernhofer: Variability of the annual hydrological regime 1821\nin Stine et al. (2009) and the resulting annual phases represent\na timing measure of the regime of the runoff ratio. The\nclimatologic behaviour of the timing, being an angular variable,\nis then analysed by circular descriptive statistics. The\ninterdecadal variability of the timing is being addressed by\na qualitative method, namely cumulative departures of the\naverage. Together with a correlation analysis to observed climate\nvariables, such as timing of temperature, annual mean\ntemperatures and monthly snow depths, we aim to identify\nthe driving processes governing the changes in the timing of\nthe runoff ratio.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Annual periodic signal extraction\nThe aim is to estimate the timing of the annual cycle from\na geophysical time series without a subjective definition of\nthe seasons. Therefore, methods are necessary to extract the\nannual cycle signal from the data and to gain a time variant\nparameter, which defines the timing of the seasons.\nIn general, there are two ways to accomplish this task.\nFirst, there are form free models, which use some seasonal\nfactor to describe a periodic pattern. This yields a good\napproximation to the periodic signal, at the cost, however,\nof estimating many parameters. The second approach are\nFourier form models which are based on harmonic functions.\nThese are generally defined by two parameters per\nfrequency: phase (φ) and amplitude. These parameters are\na natural representation of the seasonal cycle and are economic\nin terms of parameter estimation (West and Harrison,\n1997). Using several long temperature series, Paluš et al.\n(2005) compared four different methods for estimating the\ntemporal evolution of the annual phase (sinusoidal model fitting,\ncomplex demodulation via Hilbert Transform, Singular\nSpectrum Analysis and the Wavelet transform). They found\ngood agreement between these methods and concluded that\nthe annual phase is a robust and objective way to estimate the\nonset of seasons.\nRecently, Stine et al. (2009) analysed trends in the phase of\nsurface temperatures on a global perspective. They used the\nFourier transform to compute annual phases and amplitudes:\nYx =\n2\n12\n11.5∑\nt=0.5\ne2πit/12 x (t + t0), (1)\nwhere x(t + t0) are 12 monthly observations of one year with\nthe series average removed. The offset t0 denotes the middle\nof the month. Phase φx and amplitude Ax are derived for\neach year x, by computing the argument and modulus from\nYx :\nφx = tan\n−1 (Im (Yx)/Re (Yx)) (2)\nAx = |Yx |. (3)\nEquation (1) is applied separately for each calendar year in\nthe record to gain a series of annual phases and amplitudes.\nThis method is based on the assumption that the annual cycle\nfollows a sinusoidal function. Qian et al. (2011) note that\nsuch a-priori defined seasonal structures might underestimate\nnonlinear climatic variations and propose the usage of adaptive\nand temporally local methods such as empirical mode\ndecomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD. In an analysis of\nseasonal components of temperature records, Vecchio et al.\n(2010) showed that there has been a good agreement of the\nestimated phase shift of temperature using EMD and the estimate\nof Stine et al. (2009). Because of the simplicity of\nthe method of Stine et al. (2009) and good agreement with\nmore complex methods, this method has been used to estimate\nthe annual phases of temperature and the runoff ratio in\nthis analysis.\n2.2 The runoff ratio and its annual phase\nGenerally, the runoff regime in Central Europe has distinct\nseasonal features, but it is not very balanced and can be quite\ndifferent from an harmonic such as a cosine function. In\ncontrast, the ratio of runoff and basin rainfall, the runoff ratio\n(RR) has a more distinct seasonal course. It represents\nthe fraction of runoff observed at the basin outlet from the\namount of precipitation for a certain period. The regime of\nthe runoff ratio naturally reflects key processes of the basin\nwater balance. Most important are the seasonal characteristics\nof precipitation, the actual basin evapotranspiration and\nthe storage and release of water in soil or snow pack. Over\nthe year these processes form a marked seasonal cycle.\nMoreover, the runoff ratio is a direct measure of water\navailability of a basin, and thus an important quantity in\nwater management. Lastly, the runoff ratio is a normalisation\nwhich allows to compare quite different hydrological\nregimes.\nTo illustrate the procedure of deriving a timing measure\nfor the annual cycle of the runoff ratio, Fig. 1 (top) depicts\nmonthly rainfall and runoff sums over a period of 5 years for\nan example basin. In the bottom graph, the resulting monthly\nrunoff ratio (Q/P) is shown. Due to snow melt the ratio is\nlarger than 1 in late winter time, also heavy rain events in\nsummer may induce spikes in the record. Therefore, threemonthly\nrunning runoff ratios RR3 = RRt =\nQt−1+Qt+Qt+1\nPt−1+Pt+Pt+1\nfor each month t have been computed. These are generally\nsmoother and better suitable for estimation of the annual cycle.\nThe estimated cosine functions are depicted in the bottom\ngraph of Fig. 1. Geometrically the phase angle φ corresponds\nto the maximum of the cosine function. Further, φ is in fact\na circular variable within the range of [−π, π ]. For convenience\nthe phase angles are transformed to represent the day\nof year (doy): doy = 365 φ/2 π .\nStine et al. (2009) note that monthly input data already\ngives accurate timing estimates. We verified this by using\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1819/2011/ Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1819–1833, 2011\n', '1822 M. Renner and C.

For temperature no essential\nchange was found at all levels. For runoff ratio the\nannual phase estimates tend to a common annual phase estimate\nwhen increasing the aggregation window.\nTo compare the derived timing of runoff ratio, an independent\nmetric, the half-flow dates (Q50) have been chosen.\nHalf-flow dates are for example used by Stewart et al. (2005)\nto analyse streamflow timing changes and their link to seasonal\ntemperature changes in Northern America. To compute\nQ50, the streamflow is accumulated over a period, e.g. one\nhydrological year, starting at 1 November. The half-flow date\nis defined as the day that 50 % of the annual sum have passed\nthe river gauge. The derived half-flow dates of the illustrative\nexample are shown in the upper plot of Fig. 1. Already for\nthis short period, it can be seen, that both timing measures\ncan have large differences in some years, whereby the phase\nestimate shows less fluctuations than Q50.\n2.3 Descriptive circular statistics\nTo statistically analyse the timing estimates, one has to recall\nthat the timing is a circular variable. Circular variables have\ncertain properties, such as the arbitrary choice of origin and\nthe coincidence of “beginning” and the “end”. Therefore,\nlinear statistics may be inappropriate and special treatment\nis needed to derive correct conclusions from the data (Jammalamadaka\nand Sengupta, 2001).\nConsidering a set of angular observations α1, α2, ..., αn,\nthe circular mean ᾱ and variance σ 2α are computed as follows:\nᾱ = arctan\n(\nn∑\ni=1\nsin (αi)\n/\nn∑\ni=1\ncos (αi)\n)\n(4)\nσ 2α = 1 −\n1\nn\n√√√√( n∑\ni=1\nsin (αi)\n)2\n+\n(\nn∑\ni=1\ncos (αi)\n)2\n. (5)\nTo quantify the statistical relationship between the variability\nof the timing of temperature and the timing of runoff\nratio, both being angular variables, circular correlation coefficients\nhave been computed. The circular correlation ρcc\nbetween two circular vectors α and β is defined as follows\n(Jammalamadaka and Sengupta, 2001):\nρcc =\n∑n\ni=1 sin (αi − ᾱ) sin\n(\nβi − β̄\n)√∑n\ni=1 sin (αi − ᾱ)\n2 ∑n\ni=1 sin\n(\nβi − β̄\n)2 , (6)\nwith ᾱ and β̄ being the respective circular averages.\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1819–1833, 2011 www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1819/2011/\n', 'M. Renner and C. Bernhofer: Variability of the annual hydrological regime 1823\nTo compute the correlation ρc−l between a linear variable\nX and a circular variable α, Jammalamadaka and Sengupta\n(2001) suggest to transform the circular variable vector α\ninto a linear variable vector w: wi = cos(αi −α0). Whereby\nα0 = arctan (C2/C1), where C1 and C2 are the regression coefficients\nderived using using ordinary least squares from the\nexpression:\nX = M + C1 cos α + C2 sin α. (7)\nThen the transformed variable w and the linear variable X\ncan be correlated using linear correlation measures, such as\nPearson’s product moment correlation coefficient.\nGenerally, significance testing of the derived correlation\ncoefficients is based on the test statistic of the Pearson’s correlation\ncoefficient, which follows a t-distribution with n−2\ndegrees of freedom (R Development Core Team, 2010, function\ncor. test).\nFor a full treatment of circular statistics the reader is referred\nto Jammalamadaka and Sengupta (2001).\n2.4 Detection of nonstationarities, trends and change\npoints\nTo analyse the variability of the estimated annual phase angles,\nit is necessary to check for nonstationarities, such as\ntrends or structural changes of the mean or variance. As\ndecadal changes of the mean may be expected from climatic\nvariables, simple linear trends and significance testing may\nbe not useful here. Another drawback is the sensitivity of the\nlinear trend to the estimation period. Therefore, it is necessary\nto look for more complex trend patterns and analyse the\nlow-frequency variability.\nThere are many simple graphical methods available for\nthis purpose, with simple moving averages and cumulative\nsums of standardised variables (CUSUM) used in this paper.\nThe CUSUM method is often used in econometric studies\n(Kleiber and Zeileis, 2008), where the focus is on the analysis\nof regression residuals and parameter stability over time.\nThe method is also suitable to detect change points of a time\nseries.\nZeileis and Hornik (2007) presented a general framework\nfor the assessment of parameter instability, which is based on\nempirical estimating functions. These estimating functions,\ne.g. the mean of a series, must have the property that the sum\nof its residuals is equal to 0. To test for non-stationary behaviour,\ntests have been developed for these so-called empir-\nical fluctuation processes (e.g. a CUSUM) based on Standard\nBrownian Motion or “Brownian bridge” processes, (Brown\net al., 1975; Zeileis et al., 2002). Usually the resulting test\nstatistic is a threshold level (dependent on the chosen significance\nlevel) that needs to be crossed by the CUSUM estimate\nto indicate a significant deviation from stationarity. However,\nBrown et al. (1975) state that these threshold levels “should\nbe regarded as yardsticks”, to emphasise that visualising the\nCUSUM lines may be more important than just applying the\ntest.\nTo assess the stationarity of the mean of a circular variable\nthe following steps are necessary to calculate the CUSUM.\nAs the circular mean (Eq. 4) is the estimation function, we\nneed to estimate the residuals of ᾱ. To fulfil the condition\nthat the sum of the residuals must be 0, the angular deviations\nfrom ᾱ are transformed into linear variables using the sine\nfunction:\nyi = sin (αi − ᾱ), whereby\nn∑\ni=1\nsin (αi − ᾱ) = 0. (8)\nThen the CUSUM Ci at time step i is computed as follows\n(Zeileis and Hornik, 2007):\nCi =\ni∑\nj=1\nyj\n/(\nσy ×\n√\nn\n)\n(i = 1, ..., n) (9)\nwhereby σy is the estimated standard deviation of y with\nlength of the series n. In the case of linear data xi the residuals\nof the series mean yi are yi = xi − x̄.\nThe estimated CUSUM Ci is a standardised, dimensionless\nquantity and is usually plotted over time. Some notes\non how to interpret a CUSUM chart: a horizontal line fluctuating\naround 0, would imply a temporal stationary process.\nSegments of the CUSUM chart with upward slopes indicate\nabove average conditions, while downward slopes indicate\nbelow average conditions. Peaks are an indication of the time\nof a change in the mean, which can be steady or abrupt. If the\nprocess under consideration changes positively, the residuals\nare negative and a negative CUSUM peak is shown, while\nunder decreasing conditions a positive peak occurs. As the\ndeviations from the estimation function (e.g. the long term\naverage) are standardised, the magnitude and time of changes\nis comparable between different series. Last, a note to the\nsensitivity of the method to the choice of the interval. The\nmethod is sensitive to the starting and ending date, only with\nrespect to the magnitude of the CUSUM, which is partly accounted\nfor by the test statistic. However, the shape of the\nCUSUM line, i.e. the slopes and peaks remain at the same\ntemporal positions, which allows for structural change testing\nwithout any sensitivity to the selected time interval.\n3 Data\nThe analysis comprises discharge series of 27 river gauges\nthroughout Saxony and climatic data series such as precipitation,\ntemperature and snow depth records. The station data\nused within this study have first been subject to a homogeneity\ntest procedure, which has been used to detect possible\nstructural changes in the series and to exclude anomalous series\nfrom the analysis. Further, climatic data such as rainfall,\ntemperature and snow depths have been spatially interpolated\nto be able to compute river basin average values.

The stations cover large parts\nof Saxony, with catchment areas ranging between 37 and\n5442 km2. Most stations are within the Mulde River basin\n(15) or are tributaries of the Upper Elbe (6). Note that a range\nof basins are part of a common river network and are therefore\nphysically and statistically not independent. However,\n18 out of 27 are head water basins, which can be regarded\nas independent in terms of watershed properties. Detailed\ninformation may be found in Table 1 and the map in Fig. 2.\nThe discharge data have been converted to areal monthly\nrunoff (mm month−1) using the respective catchment area.\nThen the data have been subject to a homogeneity test procedure\nbased on the catchments runoff ratio. Thereby, the Pet-\ntitt homogeneity test (Pettitt, 1979) has been performed on\nannual data as well as in a seasonal setting, where for each\ncalendar month the test statistic has been computed separately,\nbut only the largest test statistic of all months has been\ntaken for significance testing. The significance levels have\nbeen determined by a Monte-Carlo simulation with normal\nN (0, 1) distributed random numbers. The details of 7 significant\n(α = 0.05) inhomogeneous series are reported in Ta-\nble 2. Note, that the reported year of the maximal test statistic\ndoes not necessarily identify the correct change point.\nHowever, in three cases dam constructions may be the probable\ncause of the inhomogeneity. For the other runoff series,\nno obvious reason has been found for the detected inhomogeneities.\nThese are probably related to measurement errors\n(for example changes in the rating curve due to cross section\nchanges) or the changes in catchment characteristics.\n4 Results and discussion\n4.1 Estimation and variability of the timing of the\nrunoff ratio\nTo gain some insight in the general spatial behaviour of the\nrunoff ratio of the selected basins, a map of the long term average\nrunoff ratio is presented in Fig. 2. There is generally a\nhigher runoff ratio in southern mountainous basins, having a\nrunoff ratio up to 0.6, which is mainly due to higher precipitation\n(up to 1030 mm annually). The basins in the hilly North\nhave lower runoff ratios ranging between 0.2 and 0.4 and\nare characterised by lower precipitation (down to 630 mm),\nhigher evapotranspiration and in contrast to the higher basins,\nlarger bodies of groundwater due to unconsolidated rock.\nAs an example, a time series of the runoff ratio is shown\nfor the gauge at Lichtenwalde in Fig. 3. The three-monthly\nrunning runoff ratio shows a distinct seasonal pattern, while\nthe 2-year running runoff ratio exhibits some low-frequency\nvariability. Looking at the spectra of the runoff ratio series,\ntwo distinct peaks are generally found, one at an annual and\nthe other at the half-year frequency (not shown).\nAs a next step, annual phases and amplitudes have been\ncomputed for each basin by applying the method of Stine\net al. (2009). The accuracy of the timing estimate is evaluated\nby comparing the estimated cosine fits with the original\ndata. According to R2 between 22 and 34 % of the variability\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Between 71 and 84 % of the variability of RR3\nis explained by the fitted cosines. Another positive effect is\nthat the standard deviation of the annual phases estimated for\nmonthly runoff ratios decreased from 18.5–27.6 to 12.7–20.1\ndays, when using three-monthly moving runoff ratios. This\nis mainly due to less extreme years, while keeping the overall\nphase average (54.4 to 55.3).\nWith regard to independence of the annual phase\nestimates, circular autocorrelation functions have been\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1819/2011/ Hydrol.

Further\nthe empirical distributions have been plotted vs. the “Von\nMises” distribution (Jammalamadaka and Sengupta, 2001;\nLund and Agostinelli, 2010), which showed no substantial\ndeviations from the 1:1 line. The “Von Mises” distribution\nmay be regarded as equivalent to the normal distribution for\ncircular data. Thus, the timing estimates do not violate distribution\nand independence assumptions for trend and corre-\nlation assessment.\nNext, average characteristics of the timing of runoff ratio\nover Saxony are analysed. We already discussed that the\nrunoff ratio shows a north to south gradient corresponding\nto increasing basin elevation (Fig. 2), which is confirmed by\nthe left panel of Fig. 4, depicting the relationship between\nthe runoff ratio and basin elevation. We find that the annual\nphase is even more dependent on the basin elevation, cf. the\nright panel of Fig. 4, with a strong linear relation of 5.5 ± 0.3\ndays per 100 m elevation change. Naturally, lower basins appear\nto have an earlier timing than higher basins, which is\ndue to earlier snow melt in winter/spring.\nTo generalize the results and because of the strong link to\naltitude, we chose to group the basins according to their average\nelevation, which resulted in 4 groups. For each group the\nphase average has been computed for each year using circular\nmeans (Eq. 4). Further, only non-connected basins are used,\nto achieve a set of independent basins. The respective height\nintervals and corresponding basins are presented in Table 3.\nDescriptive statistics such as circular average and standard\ndeviations for each elevation group are given in column φ̄RR.\nAs independent comparison to the annual phases estimated\nfrom RR3, the basin average half-flow date and its standard\ndeviation are shown in column Q̄50 of Table 3. Generally,\nthe half flow dates appear later than the annual phase estimates,\nwith about 44 days in the lowest basin group and\nabout 30 days in highest elevated basins. So half-flow dates\ndo not show such a clear difference between high and low\nbasins as annual phases do. Further, as lower basins do not\nhave such a distinct seasonal pattern as higher basins, half\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n● ●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n200 300 400 500 600 700\n0.\n2\n0.\n3\n0.\n4\n0.\n5\n0.\n6\nbasin average elevation [m asl]\nav\ner\nag\ne \nru\nno\nff \nra\ntio\n [−\n]\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n200 300 400 500 600 700\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\nbasin average elevation [m asl]\nav\ner\nag\ne \nst\nre\nam\nflo\nw\n ti\nm\nin\ng \n[d\noy\n]\nFig. 4. Height dependence of long term average runoff ratio (left\npanel) and dependence of the average streamflow timing (right\npanel).\nflow dates are less able to discern the correct timing (Déry\net al., 2009).\nComparing the different measures using the timing average\nfor all series and years, the phase estimate for the runoff\nratio is smallest (φRR = 55), while the half-flow dates are\nlargest (Q50 = 93). However, if we compute the phase directly\nfrom monthly streamflow we yield φQ = 70, which is\nin between. So a part of the differences found between Q50\nand φRR are due to the fact that half-flow dates are based\nsolely on streamflow, while the phase estimate of the runoff\nratio is normalised by precipitation. The other part of the differences\nis due to the different timing estimation techniques.\nThere are also differences in standard deviation σ between\nboth measures. While Q50 shows a σ of about 19 days, the\ntiming measure using runoff ratios has a σ of about 14 days.\nThe larger variability in Q50 can probably be attributed to\nlarger uncertainties in its estimation, e.g. owing to single\nevents (Déry et al., 2009).\n4.2 Temporal variability of the timing\nAs the timing estimate has been computed for each calender\nyear, it is now possible to investigate the high and low-\nfrequency temporal variability.\nFigure 5 presents annual phase estimates (converted into\ndoy) of the runoff ratio of the lowest and the highest basin\ngroup, respectively. In general, there is a natural difference in\ntiming between lower basins and more mountainous basins.\nHowever, from Fig. 5 it is apparent that these differences\nchanged over time with much larger differences in the period\n1950 to 1980. Also the year-to-year variability of φRR\nis larger as well. In contrast to the low basins, there is a\ntrend towards earlier timing in the higher basins since the\nlate 1960s, decreasing the differences between low and high\nbasins. We further note that the difference observed in the\nlast two decades is now smaller than it has been observed\nbefore 1950. All other basins at medium elevations show a\nbehaviour somewhere in between the both groups.\nFor CE Stahl et al.

These trends imply\na change in the phase of the cycle towards earlier timing of\nstreamflow. So, considering the same period (1962–2004) as\nStahl et al. (2010), we can confirm a decreasing trend in the\nphase of runoff ratio in mountainous basins, see Fig. 5.\nIn the following, the decadal variability, trend patterns and\nchange points of the timing of the runoff ratio will be analysed.\nSince we did not expect a linear trend prevailing over\nthis long period from 1930–2009, we chose to analyse the\ndata using CUSUM graphs, which display the low-frequency\nvariability and structural deviations from the long term average\nover time. Figure 6 shows CUSUM lines based on the\ngroup average timing of the runoff ratio. The graph shows\nthat with the beginning of the 1950s different trend directions\nin the particular basin groups have evolved. Basins above\n500 m show upslope sections until 1971 and again from 1980\nto 1988, exhibiting above average behaviour. This pattern is\nmodulated by elevation and reveals that the low-frequency\nchanges in timing are largest in the highest basins, where the\nCUSUM line hits the α = 0.05 significance level of a stationary\nprocess in the year 1988. Another peak, although lower,\nis found in 1971.

CUSUM Analysis of the annual phase of runoff ratio.

While the lowest basins show a delay of\n7 days, there is no shift in the second elevation group. The\nbasins above 500 m show negative shifts, i.e. an earlier timing\nof 10 and 22 days, respectively. Causes of the negative\ntrend patterns will be discussed in the next subsections.\nAs there is evidence of non-stationary signals in the timing\nof runoff ratio, especially for mountainous basins (cf. Fig. 6),\nthe usage of a fixed set of seasonal parameters, e.g. the\nmonthly mean, results into a systematic bias and thus unnecessarily\ninflates the variance (Thomson, 1995). A standard\ndesign study based on data of the last 50 years will be biased\ndue to the observed dynamics of the annual cycle of runoff.\nSo, e.g. hydraulic design studies should acknowledge these\nstructural changes of the annual cycle by using time variant,\ne.g. dynamic seasonal time series models.\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1819/2011/ Hydrol.

Bernhofer: Variability of the annual hydrological regime\n4.3 Does temperature explain trends in seasonality of\nrunoff ratio?\nHaving analysed the phase of the runoff ratio, it is interesting\nto check for direct links to climatic variables, especially temperature.\nIn Fig. 7 time series of the annual average tempera-\ntures for the lowest and highest basin groups are shown. The\ndepicted range is drawn from single basin temperature series.\nThe apparent temperature difference between the basin\ngroups of about 2.5 K reflects the typical elevation gradient\nof temperature.\nIn the temperature series of basins at low elevations, a\npositive linear trend is detected in the order of 0.01 K per\nyear (Kendall test p-value 0.02). Here, we applied the nonparametric\ntrend test procedure for autocorrelated data sug-\ngested by Yue et al. (2002). In the higher basins the linear\ntrend is weaker with 0.003 K per year (Kendall test p-\nvalue 0.22) and not significant. Instead, there is a period of\nlower temperatures from 1960 to 1990. Since then an increase\nis found.\nThe timing of the annual cycle of temperature for the\nbasins investigated is also shown in Fig. 7. The differences\nbetween the basins are small (1.5 days between lowest and\nhighest basins) compared to the standard deviation (on average\n3.5 days). The long term variability of the annual phase\nof temperature is relatively constant. However, since the end\nof the 1980s, there is a decline in the average of about 4 days,\nconcluding with the most extreme years (2006 very late, and\n2007 very early) observed.\nTo visualise the temperature timing influence on the seasonality\nof runoff ratio, we classified the 80 years of data\ninto early years, having annual phases below the first quartile\n(before doy 198) and late years, having phases in the last\nquartile (after doy 204). Then we used this classification to\nbin the series of runoff ratio for every month over the year.\nThe resulting boxplots in Fig. 8 depict the seasonal runoff ratio\ndistribution of each group over the year. As can be seen\nfor the river gauge Koenigsbrueck, larger runoff ratios and\nlarger variability from February to April are observed in late\nyears, than in early years. At the river gauge Lichtenwalde,\nthe differences between early and late years are even more\ndistinct, with significant differences for the months April till\nAugust, with late years having an higher runoff ratio than\nearlier ones. The opposite is true for the months October till\nDecember. The average monthly temperatures superimposed\nin Fig. 8, reflect the actual differences between early and late\nyears on temperature, which are larger during the first half of\nthe year.\nTo quantify the link between these angular variables, circular\ncorrelation coefficients have been computed from the\nannual phase of the basin runoff ratio and the annual phase\nof the basin average temperature. The results are detailed for\neach basin elevation group in Table 3, column ρcc. The correlation\ncoefficients tend to increase with elevation.

Note that in this case the timing has been treated as\nlinear variable. The coefficient is also plotted against average\nbasin elevation for all basins in Fig. 9. Again, there\nis a distinct height dependence, which is increasing with\n0.36 ± 0.01 per 100 m basin height. For mountainous basins,\nwe find a coefficient of about three in magnitude, which\nmeans that a decrease of the phase of temperature of 5 days,\namounts to a decrease of 15 days in the timing of the runoff\nratio.\nThe increased sensitivity of hydrological regimes to temperature\nat higher altitudes has been often cited in literature.\nE.g. Barnett et al. (2005) state that rising temperatures possibly\nlead to earlier timing of the hydrologic regime. We find\nindeed that the annual basin temperature is correlated with\nthe annual phase of runoff ratio. In fact, there is a linearcircular\ncorrelation of −0.37 in the highest basins, which is\nlinearly increasing with decreasing basin elevation to 0.13 in\nthe lowest basins. However, this correlation is only half in\nmagnitude compared to the phase of temperature. Considering\nthe whole annual cycle, the timing relationship between\ntemperature and runoff ratio is stronger and more relevant\nthan the one with annual temperatures.\n4.4 Trend analysis in snow dominated basins\nIn the previous section, we found that the correlation to the\nannual phase of temperature and its effect on the timing of\nthe runoff ratio increases with elevation. It is clear, that temperature\nalone does not influence the runoff ratio, tempera-\nture instead acts as a trigger for snow precipitation and snow\nmelt. Therefore, a detailed look at snow depth observations\nis interesting. Since 1950, a network of snow depth observations\nhas been established in Saxony, which is dense enough\nto compute basin averages.\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Bernhofer: Variability of the annual hydrological regime\nhowever, does not influence the general behaviour, with the\nnegative peak in the year 1988, revealing a significant change\nin the mean towards higher temperatures. Also the phase of\ntemperature shows a peak in 1988, but in opposite direction,\nindicating decreasing conditions. Besides, the low-frequency\nbehaviour of the phase of temperature is not influenced by\nthe change in station density, showing the robustness of this\nmeasure.\nThe CUSUM graph of the annual phase of runoff ratio\n(Fig. 10) also shows this peak in 1988, reaching the significance\nlevel α = 0.05. Moreover, there is another peak appar-\nent in 1971, where there is no indication from both temperature\nrelated series. But, we found a striking similarity of\nthe CUSUM graph for March snow depths, which displays\nboth peaks and even though the significance levels are not\nreached, they provide evidence, that late winter snow cover\nmay also explain the low-frequency variability of φRR.\nThese statistical links underline the strong influence of late\nwinter snow cover on the timing of φRR and subsequently on\nthe annual hydrological regime. This influence naturally increases\nwith elevation (cf. column ρsnow of Table 3). Under\nthe assumption that there is no limitation of winter precipitation,\nsnow cover is to a large part controlled by temperatures\nbelow or above 0 ◦C. This argument might be an explanation\nthat with increasing basin elevation, also increasing correlation\nand linear slopes (cf. Fig. 9) have been found between\nthe timing of temperature and the timing of the runoff ratio\n(cf. Table 3). Still, late winter snow cover is a better predictor\nthan the phase of temperature.\nThe coincidence of peaks in the CUSUM graphs in Fig. 10\nindicates that the respective elements undergo structural\nchanges at the same time. Especially the apparent 1988\nchange point in all series investigated may be related to distinct\nchanges towards less air pollution with aerosols over\nCE since 1980 (Philipona et al., 2009). So probably, the increasing\nincoming short wave radiation resulted in increased\ntemperatures, earlier snow melt and, eventually, also in the\nadvance of the timing of temperature.\nAir pollution also impacted forest vegetation, with subsequent\ntree-die off since the 1960s and with major clear\ncuts in the 1980s (Šrámek et al., 2008) at the mountain\nridge in southern Saxony. Thus especially the headwaters\nof some rivers analysed here have been affected. Such dramatic\nchanges in vegetation cover may have also influenced\nhydrologic processes and subsequently the timing of runoff\nratio. However, quantifying such effects is out of the scope\nof this study, and remains open for further research.\n4.5 Uncertainty and significance of the results\nFor the interpretation of the results it is necessary to list the\nsources of uncertainty and to examine their relevance.\nFirst of all, there may be measurement errors or inhomogeneities\nin the observed runoff and rainfall series. When we\nassume that these errors lead to an abrupt but constant change\nof the mean at a given location, the cyclic behaviour and thus\nthe phase is unlikely to be affected systematically.\nIn 7 basins inhomogeneities in the runoff ratio series have\nbeen detected. Without detailed information, it is impossible\nto correct for such changes. Therefore, these records\nhave been kept in the dataset without a correction. We performed\nsome cross checking by subsequently removing the\nsuspect series from the computation of the group averages.\nThe resulting differences to the original group average are\nof comparable magnitude than the standard deviation of the\naveraged series, but small with respect to the assessed correlations\nand long term shifts.\nAnother source of uncertainty is the estimation of basin\nprecipitation. Apart from the spatial interpolation error,\nwhich is assumed to average out, we had to face the problem\nof changes of the observation network over time. To check\nfor effects of this inhomogeneity, three different sets of input\nstations have been prepared (cf. the Appendix). When\ncomparing the resulting annual phases of these different precipitation\ninput sets, only marginal differences for the timing\nestimates have been found.\nThen there is some uncertainty in the estimation of the\ntiming of the annual cycle using the approximation of a harmonic\nfunction to the data. We quantified this uncertainty by\ncalculating the explained variance of the original series. This\nis not possible for traditional timing measures, such as halfflow\ndates. Further we showed that the year-to-year variabil-\nity could be reduced by smoothing the data before applying\nthe annual filter.\nFinally, the overall uncertainty in the phase estimates and\ntheir low-frequency variability was assessed by grouping the\ndata according to basin elevation. The range within a group is\na measure of the accuracy of our estimates. As these ranges\nwere generally smaller than the temporal variability, we can\nconclude that the averaging method was robust. Moreover,\nthe main features are repeated within this large set of river\nbasins distributed over several elevation levels. This last argument\nunderlines that the change points found in the phase\nof runoff ratio are not random or catchment specific, but a\nresult of changing climate conditions.\n5 Conclusions\nThe timing of annual hydrological regimes of river basins\nthroughout Saxony/Germany has been evaluated over the period\nfrom 1930 to 2009. We introduced a timing measure for\nhydrological time series, which is based on a harmonic filter\nof monthly data. The measure is applicable to all hydrological\nregimes found throughout Saxony and it is expected to\nwork elsewhere, where a distinct annual cycle in a time series\nis apparent. Comparing with traditional streamflow tim-\ning measures such as half-flow dates, which can be easily biased\nby single events, we showed that the resulting standard\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1819–1833, 2011 www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1819/2011/\n', 'M. Renner and C. Bernhofer: Variability of the annual hydrological regime 1831\ndeviation of the harmonic measure is generally lower and\nthus less influenced by single events.\nA climatology of the timing of the dimensionless runoff\nratio (RR) was established, covering 27 river basin at different\nelevation levels. Basin elevation was found to be the\nmost important catchment characteristic, controlling (i) average\ntiming, (ii) the magnitude of observed long-term shifts\nin timing and (iii) the apparent sensitivity to the timing of\ntemperature. All mentioned characteristics increase with elevation.\nAnalysing the temporal variability, we observed a shift\nof the seasonal cycle towards occurring earlier in the year\nin basins being on average above 500 m, with the largest\nchanges in the highest basins. This long-term shift in timing\nof runoff ratio represents a trend towards earlier timing\nof about 10 to 22 days in the last two decades, relative to the\nprevailing conditions between 1950 and 1988.\nThe interannual variability of runoff ratio timing records\nis in the same order as the apparent long term shifts, but\nindependent from elevation. There is, however, a remarkable\ncoherence of the year-to-year changes across all basins\nanalysed. Also, the long-term change patterns revealed by\na CUSUM analysis of the standardised anomalies showed\na similarity in slopes and peaks between elevation groups.\nPresumably, the observed changes are driven by larger scale\nphysical processes, which have similar effects at the annual,\nas well as at the decadal time scale.\nAs expected, a large fraction of the observed variability\nmay be explained by the low and high frequency variability\nof temperature records. Indeed, the annual timing of temperature,\nwhich can be estimated with high confidence, showed\nsignificant positive correlations with the timing of the runoff\nratio. Again, the correlation as well as the linear regression\ncoefficient showed to be dependent on basin elevation. Moreover,\nthe timing of the temperature cycle has more influence\non the timing of the runoff ratio than the magnitude of annual\naverage temperatures.\nHowever, the apparent low-frequency variability of RR\ncould not be explained by temperature observations alone.\nThe main cause of the observed high and low frequency variability\nin higher elevated basins is the variability of late win-\nter snow cover. It explained a larger fraction of the variability\nthan the timing of temperature and matched the low frequent\ndepartures from the average of the timing of runoff ratio quite\nwell.\nThe climatic changes observed by the temperature regime\nare most likely the major cause of the observed changes\nin hydrological variables. There is evidence of a structural\nchange of the average behaviour of several observation variables\nin the year 1988. The CUSUM related stationarity test\nrevealed (i) a significant shift in the timing of runoff ratio in\nhigh basins, (ii) a marked but not significant change in late\nwinter snow depths, accompanied by (iii) a significant increase\nof annual temperature of about 1 K and (iv) a marked\nbut not significant advance of the timing of temperature of\n4 days.\nWe believe that this chain of changes has been triggered by\nthe drastic changes in industrial and domestic air pollution,\nbecause the dimming and brightening of the atmosphere over\nSaxony resulted in remarkable changes in solar insolation.\nFurther, this accelerated and distinct change in the timing of\nboth, temperature and runoff ratio indicates that impacts of\nclimate change on the water cycle are stronger in mountainous\nareas.\nIf the trends in the phase and average of temperature persist,\na range of potential problems for water resources man-\nagement will evolve. The most critical problem is that the delay\nbetween natural water supply and demand will increase\nand subsequently a larger artificial storage volume may be\nneeded to maintain the same security level of supply. Next,\nthe shift in both, mean and variability of monthly streamflow\nwill alter traditional assumptions used for predicting seasonal\nwater availability. This underlines the importance for maintaining\nand improving the existing observational network.\nAppendix A\nPreparation of basin input data\nA1 Precipitation\nThe geographical domain (11.5◦–16◦ E, 50◦–52◦ N) has been\nchosen for the spatial interpolation and station data selection.\nThe station network density has changed dramatically\nthroughout time. Currently there is one station available in\nthe database since 1858, 12 stations since 1891 rising up\nto 111 in the 1930s. Due to World War II only 20 stations\nwere available in 1945. From the 1950s, the network has\nimproved from 374 in 1951 to a maximum of 873 in 1990.\nSince 2000, the network density decreased to 354 in 2008.\nTo check for influences of the changing network, three\ndata sets have been prepared. One set only with stations covering\nthe full period without longer missing periods, another\nset which consists of all observations available at a time step\nand another set which has been used in the analysis. This last\nset is a compromise between the other two sets, meeting the\nrequirement that the respective series covers at least 40 years,\ni.e. from 1950–1990. This set contains 368 stations.\nBased on these stations a homogeneity test procedure has\nbeen conducted. Depending on available meta-data a part of\nthese stations has been tested for known breakpoints using\nthe Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test for changes in the location\nand the Bartlett test for changes in the variance. If all these\ntests reject the hypothesis of no change at the α = 0.05 level,\nthen the series has been flagged as suspect. Next, an iterative\nhomogeneity test procedure has been done using a weighted\nseries of about 5 reference stations. Reference stations are\nselected according to 4 criteria: (i) not inhomogeneous from\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1819/2011/ Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1819–1833, 2011\n', '1832 M. Renner and C. Bernhofer: Variability of the annual hydrological regime\nprevious test, (ii) best correlation of the differenced series\n(Peterson and Easterling, 1994), (iii) cover most of the record\nof the candidate station and (iv) are close to the candidate.\nThen the Alexandersson homogeneity test and the Pettitt test\nhave been applied. If both tests reject the hypothesis of stationarity\nat the α = 0.01 level, then the series has been flagged\nas suspect. Finally, a set of 299 precipitation series have been\nleft for spatial interpolation, i.e. without any suspect series.\nThe stations can be found in the right panel of Fig. 2. There\nare 83 stations during the 1930s, about 290 from 1950–1990\nwith 170 in the last decade.\nBased on the station dataset a spatial interpolation for each\nmonth has been computed. First, a linear height relationship\nusing a robust median based regression (Theil, 1950)\nhas been established. Then the residuals have been interpolated\nonto an aggregated SRTM grid (Jarvis et al., 2008)\nof 1500 m raster size using an automatic Ordinary Kriging\n(OK) procedure (Hiemstra et al., 2009). Monthly basin average\nprecipitation is then computed by the average of the\nrespective grid cells. The method of height regression and\nOK of the residuals has been chosen, as this method showed\nto have the lowest root-mean-square errors (RMSE) among\nother methods in a cross-validation based on monthly station\ndata sets.\nA2 Temperature and snow depth data\nThe network of climate stations in the domain has also\nchanged during time. Since 1930, 9 long temperature series\nhave been available, this increased to 47 in 1961 and\nagain reduced to 38 in 2008. A few snow depth observations\nare available from climate stations. Additionally, a dense\nnetwork of snow depths has been established in the region\nsince 1950. On average, 163 series are available. For both\nelements, the basin averages have been computed using the\nmethods already described for precipitation in Sect. A1.\nAcknowledgement.
