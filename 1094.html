"We keep accurate records showing the amount of travel on every lino\nat all hours of the day and, where we find crowded conditions on any line, we adjust\nthe service. ,\n\'.\n"We make accurate and regular measurement of tho traffic flow and operate sufficient\ncars to handle traffic during the rush hours, with comfort and-dispatch closely ap\nproximating conditions of normal service.\nUnavoidable conditions frequently play smash with schedules. Instead of tho cars\ncoming at regular intervals of two or three minutes, they sometimes come in bunches.\nThen the Hurry. Family gets busy. They make a grand rush for tho first car and\novercrowd it. And when a car is overcrowded more stops are necessary, more time\nis consumed by passengers in alighting, and minutes are added to tho trip-time.\nWhen a man help3 overcrowd a car at rush hours ho forces all the cars including\' his\nown into low gear. And the cars behind visually show empty scats. Tho Hurry Fam\nily, seeking to save a minute, loses two or three and also sacrifices comfort.\nTry waiting for the car behind when the .car you want is already carry\ning capacity load. You will get homo just as quickly and more com- \'\nfortably and you will help us maintain good service for all.\nHelp others and you help yourself. .. \'-\nWait a minute and save two or three. -\' "\'CI\nJAMES P.
