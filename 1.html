Nov. (J.?The parish, house of St. Agnes\' German Catholic, Church was wrecked at 4:10 a. m., yesterday by a bomb hurled by a mys, terious would be assassin. The five, occupants of the house miraculously, escaped injury. The police have no, clew to the bomb-thrower, but every, detective in the city is working on the, case. Pastoral letters, sent out by, Archbishop Ireland advancing the, ?cause of food conservation and the, Liberty Loan bonds, have been read, in the church recently. Father Freis, lebcn suspects that a pro-German fa, natic may have been responsible for, the bomb outrage., LAST NIGHT\'S SERVICE, in, Rev. Regester Preaches Sermon, Which he Asks Church Members, What They Have lloen Doing for, Christ., The revival meeting at the M. E., church south was conducted last, evening; in the lower auditorium of, the church. There was a large repre, sentation of the grown-ups of the, city but not of the children. The, fact that the latter were not pres, ent was somewhat disappointing to, the Rev. E. V. Regester who is mak, ing a special effort to reach the, young people of the community., The text was St. Matt. 27:22,, which gives a vivid picture of the, embarrassment of Pilate by having.\', Jesus Christ on his hands. In the!, course of bis sermon Rev. Regester, said Pilate tried to shift the respon, sibility i>y throwing the burden up, on others. In these modern times, many people are imitators of Pilate:, putting the responsibility for an-1, other\'s soul on someone else. The, blood of Jesus has been upon "Pilate\'s, soul all these centuries. Oh, how the, ;urse of Cod follows., The words that come from the, Governor are like a two edged sword.!, First, the Christians have Jesus on, their hands. What have you done for, Jesus all these years that you have, seen a member of his church? Many:, consciences have caught their posj, sessors at a disadvantage?their J, cowardness has made them anything!, 3ut a Christian. Some people use\'the j, name of Jesus and His church asj, something to conjure with. Some peo- j, pie carry around a rabbit\'s foot, j, Have you gone out of your way to j, win someone for Christ? If we are!, :o be Christians we must be like!, Ghrist. Go out and meet those who i, iced Christ. Second. Christ does not:, ?elease those who have not been, converted. The "not saved responsi-!, lility" is upon the souls of those who;, lave heard about Him and have not j, jbeyed Hitri. This responsibility must, i>e met some day. What answer will j, rou make when you meet Christ?!, iVe can accept Him and die, and wo;, :-an accept Him and live. Will vou!, T I, spoil your heart and let Jesus, Christ come into your heart? l.eti, Him have full sway., Notes., The services this evening will be, 3fin at 7.4") sharp. A song fest opens, the Tegular evening service.
