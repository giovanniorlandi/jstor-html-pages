It is said Mr.\nHooe\'s resignation was tendered be\ncause the road was planning to trans\nfer him to some other point. On\nWednesday Mr. Brasher, the chief\nclerk at Henderson, was sent here\nand the auditor was present to\ncheck in the new agent, when a tele\ngram was received telling Mr.\nBrasher to return to Henderson and\nfor the present Mr. Hooe remains in\ncharge of the office.

Slaughter is the negro who\nwent into the store of Mr. Jenkins\nat Edgoten and shot him down in a\ncowardly and brutal manner.

The case is one of the worst\nmurder cases ever tried here.\n.The trial of Bud Word, col., for\nthe murder of Ed White, col., over\n50 cents, was given to the jury yes\nterday morning.

The\nstreets were thronged with the fair\nsex as they passed from store to\nstore. A few of them were wearing\nnew hats that they had previously\nselected, and were anxious to find\nout whether they had in their pre\nopening day purchases really caught\nup with. the latest styles in headwear.\nThere were many out-of-town ladies\nwho came in on the trains and in ve\nhicles to study what became them\nmost, finally arriving at the conclu\nsion, and very wisely, that it is best\nto trust to the taste of the milliner.\nThe salespeople were kept quite\nbusy during both days and sales\nboth in millinery and ready-to-wear\nsuits were perhaps larger than upon\nany other like occasion.\nIn millinery this fall there are\nreally no great changes. For street\nwear the large hats will be much\nworn, probably as much as last fall,\nbut the rule of fashion has cut them\ndown somewhat. Hats for other1\noccasions are much smaller. In New\nYork this season feathers are still\nmuch affected, and both in high art\ngarments and headwear brown is\nsaid to be the predominating color.\nIt may be that brown is less easily\nsoiled and also that it harmonizes\nwell and at the same time it can be\nworn by either blondes or brunettes.\nPlushes in.many shades are also pop\nular this year. Fashionable New\nYork ladies still affect suits, hats,\nhose, shoes and gloves of the same\nshade. Of course this lightens "hub.\nby\'s" purse.but Dame Fashion cares\nnothing about that.\nThe three leading milliners of the\ncity, J. H. Anderson & Co.,Frankers\nBusy store and Miss Fannie Rogers,\nhad on display Thursday and Friday\nthe prettiest line of ladies\' hats that\nthey have ever brought here. Miss\nRogers deals exclusively in millinery,\nbut the two former are amonn: the\nlargest dealers in ladies\' ready-to-\nwear suits and they have eclinsed\nthemselves in placing before their\nlady patrons the most elaborate as\nvvel as Dlainer erarmentg that catch\ntne iancy or tne gentler sex\nNow\nJULIE RING\nIn the Big Musical Comedy Success\nWatch The Date\nAfter yout\npromptly, and not ml i nam\nber.

These cards were collected\nyesterday and turned over to a com\nmittee of the school board who will\nannounce the result and if a majori\nty of the parents and guardians pre\nfer the single session it will be con\ntinued, otherwise the old plan of\ntwo sessions will be resumed. In\nmany large cities the single session\nhas been adopted and it seems to be\ngrowing in faw. As used here the\ngrammar grad-s are turned out at\none and the high school at 1:30.\nIc is needless to add that the child\nren themselves nearly all favor the\nshort school day.\nadays ladies are far more inclined to\nbuy their garments ready made than\never before, for the large firms in\nthe country engaged in these exclu\nsive lines of manufacture can furnish\nanything that may be called for.\nThe O. G. Sprouse Co., the "walk\na block and save a dollar" people,,\nhad a special opening yesterday. Ia\nthis sale they made a terrific slaugh\nter, .in prices on wearing apparel,\nhats, gloves, hosiery and almost ev\nerything: in their very comprehend\nsive line of trade. They caucrht the\ncrowd and did a fine day\'s business.\nin order to add "tone" to the occa\nsion they brought an Italian band\nfrom Nashville and gave store con.\ncerts during the day and night.\nBUSY BOPKINSVIUE\nTakes A Day 01F and Raises\n$6,000 For New Railroad.\nYou can count on Hopkinsville to\nba there with the goods.

The piano\nwith its strings is like you with your\nnerves. Sometimes when you are not\nfeeling well, when you are uncomfort\nable and unhappy and your nerves\nunstrung, you are apt to bo dull or\nraspy, and then when you are feeling\nwell and your nerves are all right\nyou aro gay and cheerful. And it is\njust the same with the piano; it has,\nits moods. Let the weather condi\ntions be unfavorable and the piano\nmay bo dull and even out of tune;\nbut let the conditions bo just right\nfor it, as they aro this bright morn\ning, and it answers musically in\nevery note. The piano depends on\nconditions, just as you\' do.

Have in the\nlower rooms and in all the halls lan\ntern lamps which swing from the\nceiling and near the center of the liv\ning room place several substantial\ntable lamps which cannot possibly be\ntoppled over..

The profes- j\nsional critic, especially the critic who\nis forever on the lookout for heresies\nin art, often reminds us of the pro\nfessional grammarian. It is one of\nthe ironies of the ordinary school\ngrammar book that the examples of\nbad English are all drawn from good\nauthors. When the grammarian un\ndertakes to illustrate some incorrect,\nusage it is his habit to pick a lino\nfrom the very best author he possibly\ncan find. And as he is never content\nto invent an illustrative sentence or\nto pick one from an obscure source,\nbut must always go to one of un\nquestionable merit, so it comes about\nthat such authors as Shakespeare,\nMilton, Dryden, Swift, Addison and\nDo Quincey stand out on every page,\nin the quality of horrible example\nNew York Evening Sun.\nWAS MERELY CONFUSED.\nEvidence that William Parker,\ncolored", had tried to hitch hia horse\nto his wagon while it faced the wrong\nway in the shafts, was pot enough to\nconvince Acting Judge Averill in\npolice court, that Parker was intoxi\ncated, and he was dismissed in police\ncourt. On the charge of disorderly\nconduct, however, he was fined $5\nand costs. Parker was arrested Sat\nurday night at Blake and Walnut\nstreets. His excuse for the odd posi\ntion of the horse was that bojs there\nwere bothering him, and that they\nhad continued unhitching his horse\nevery time he tried to get into his\nwagon. Parker admitted that when\ntho "police came he began to object\nand that he may have been disorder\nly.

Its object is not solely to\npreserve a few animajs and birds to\nfurnish sport for a limited clasp, but\nto protect and increase useful species\nfor the benefit of the people in, gen\neral. "The personnel of the new Game\nand Fish Commission guarantees a\nfaithful and efficient enforcement of\nthe laws of the State which are de\nsigned to preserve not only game\nanimals and game birds, but also\nbirds of song and plumage and those\nwhich are beneficial as destroyers of\ninjurious insects and noxious weeds.\nWhile securing the support of the\nsportsmen, it benefits the farmer by\nincreasing the species which are use\nful to him and commands the inter\nest of that ever-increasing clas3 of\npersons who find health or recrea\ntion in observing or studying nature.\n"With the development of the leg\nislation for the protection of fish and\ngameTias occurred another develop\nment intended to afford greater pro\ntection to land owners and tenants\nThis legislation took the form of\npenalties incorporated in the game\nlaws for certain forms of trespass\nand vandalism.

Rabbits, quail, and\nother game taken during the open\nseason, afford not only an import\nant addition to the table, but may\nsave considerable expenditure for\nother meat. The value of this game\nis, therefore, not merely the amount\nit would bring in cash or in provis\nion at the country store, but rather\nwhat it saves in the cost of other\nmeats, This economic result, this\nincreased food supply, is of certain\nbenefit to the whole State and makes\nthe work of the commission in en-\nforcing the game and fish laws of\nt,rPRt nnhlic interest nnH tsnrrhv nf\n.\nAs To Fish.\n"Now as regards fish: \'\n"You will notice that ours is a\nGame and Fish Commission and our\nduties and purposes embrace the\ni mro and nronaeation of fish as well\nas game\nand, as a matter of fact,\ntha fishermen will reap the benefits\noi us activities uiong wun me man\nwith a gun a dog, and while the law\nJpe.not require a license, to fish the\ngood sportsman and public-spirited\nngler should, and doubtl\'sr w\ncontribute to the game Mid ftsh pro j\ntetion fund by taking out license.\nVThe tat Legislature made j\nhdsime appropriation, for the\npurchase of land adjoining the State\nFair for the purpose. of pstablishing\na halchvry which wM brtoperatedby\nthe United States Government, hi\nthe propa-gntion of fish for distribu\ntion and educational purposes of ex\nhibition.

Special sympathy\nis due the unlucky creature who,\nonce hooked and twice swallowed,\nhad more than his share of misad\nventure. At Woodlands, near to Ivcrcargill,\n& lad of t\'welvo years and myself\namused ourselves setting side lines\nin aswamp creek, baiting a small\ntriangle hook with rabbit-flesh tied\non with a\' file flax fiber.\nOne evening my little friend cried\nin excitement, "Oh, do come, here!\nI\'ve got a whopper 1" On going, I\nfound a heavy eel (it subsequently\nweighed seven and one-quarter\npounds) on the line, and on pulling\nit out was astonished at the way in\nwhich I found it secured. Tho line\nwas tiod to a flab-bush, and thence\nI found it entered the eel\'s mouth,\ncame out again at tho gill, and\nagain, with hook and bait, disap\npeared down the eel\'s gullet. I car\nried it as it was up to the homestead,\nand in tho presence of host and fam\nily opened it, and found inside a\nsmall eel about twelve to eighteen\ninches long, with the hook and bait\nin its belly.\nThis little chap had first swal\nlowed the hook and bait, next was\nswallowed by tho big eel, then\ncrawled out through the gill, and\nwas a second time swallowed by the\nbig fellow, who, in the fierce strug\ngle that followed, had drawn the\nloop so tight as to pull his head and\nneck into a curve, and had actually\ntorn the gill throughfor an inch.\nOn. two or on three other occa\nsions I have found that a small eel\nthat has swallowed the bait, and\nbeen in turn swallowed by a big eel,\nhas crept through and hung outside\nthe gill of its captor; but this is tho\nfirst time I haye heard of one being\ntwice swallowed.\nSHE COULD USE THEM\nKatharine I Baw you this morn\ning with that horrid widow, Mrs.\nWeeds.

His movements for tho\nmoment were all more or less unde\ncided because of tho weighty prob\nlem that held his mind captive. He\nspent a few more moments over tho\nangle of his hat, then went out into\nthe busy streets.\nNaturally Sunderland\'s footsteps\ntook him in the direction of his fa\nvorito haunts, tho old second-hand\nshops. Ho stood aimlessly looking\nover the musty and dusty contents\nof the windows and all tho time he\nwas asking himself the question,\n"Shall I ask Enid to marry me?"\nSunderland\'s fingers were uncon\nsciously running through a stack pf\nwell-worn music and he suddenly\nrealized that if Enid had possessed\neven a talent for the lightest of\nmusic ho could have care more for\nher. He was not a musician, nor\neven a critic, but ho felt that his\nhome would be incomplete without\na little music. His mother had al\nways played and sung, and his most\npleasant recollection was of the twi\nlight evenings his mother had glad\ndened with her Bongs.\nSunderland was looking through\nthe old music now with conscious in\nterest. Ho drew a swift, sharp\nbreath, then sighed; it was as if a\ngentle presence were hovering over\nhim. He had \' found a song his\nmother used to sing." The children\nhad always asked for it because it\nwas a fairy legend and spoke of\nelves and hobgoblins.\nA longing to hear the song again\nstole over him. With a vague idea\nof asking someone to sing it for\nhim, Sunderland bought the copy\nand left the shop. Then with his\nusual analytical turn of mind he\nfell to wbndering who had owned the\nlong and just how it. had reached\nthe second-hand shop. He looked\nfor a name on the music and found\none.\n"Inez Claire," he read, and then\nin faint pencil scrawl beneath he\nmade out the name of a big studio\nbuilding. "Now the question is," he\npondered, "whether Inez Claire has\nbecome a great operatic singer or\nwhether failure has prompted her to\ndispose of it."\nAnd while Sunderland strove to\nweave" an atmosphere about the song\nthe memory of Enid Valentine was\n!o3t and in its place a desire to find\nthe girl who had sung his mother\'s\nsong possessed him. He told him\nself that it was not a romantic sense\nthat prompted h"im; it was merely a\nlonging to hear the familiar song.\nBecause his time was his own for\nthe moment he made his way to the\nstudios mentioned on the song. Ar\nriving there, he learned that Miss\nClaire had left a year or so ago\nAfter much inquiry he was given\nan address in the country to which\nher mail had been forwarded.\nMore or less discouraged, but\nwith accented desire to find her,\nSunderland went his way.\nIn the course of a day or so he\naacepted an invitation from Jimmy\nDale to spend a few days with him\nin the country, the suburb being\ntne one to which Inez Ulairo had\ngone to after leaving tho studio\nbuilding.\nOn their way home from the sta\ntion Jimmy drew up at a small vio\nlet farm; \'The mater Wants me to\nbring her some violets for the din\nner table,\' ho said by way of expla\nnation. \'You had better come in,\nTherofis a peach of a girl here a\nfriend of my mother."\nSunderland followed. At tho far\nend of the hothouse they caught\nsight of the mistress of tho violets.\nShe was gowned in a simple frock\nof lilac and made an Exquisite pic\nture there among \' tho millions of\npurple blossoms. Sunderland was\nguilty of hurrying his footsteps.\n"She is making a small fortune\nraising .violets," whispered Jimmy\nDale. "How is the Queen of Vio\nlets today?" he inquired by way of\ngreeting trfij girl.\n"Splendid," she returned with a\nhappy little laugh.\n"Miss Claire, Mr. gundcrlif 1,"\nJinuj\'y introduced the pair puWdic\ntoiil.v.\nThe smile that dawned over v\nderland\'s face surprised evc.j t.\nto\nthe;\nhomage of men.\n"If you arc Inez Claire," he began\nwithout preface, "I was just start\ning a search for you."\nInez looked up. Jimmy did like\nwise. "This is evidently no place for\nme," the latter Said laughingly, and\nturned to talk to tho gardener. "Sun\nderland sure is struok," ho muttered\nto himself.\n"Yes, I am Inez Claire," the girl\nanswered; then added with a laugh,\n"I hope you have discovered that I\nam an heiress and "\nA swiftly hidden emotion passed\nacross the girl\'s face and she did not\nspeak for a moment. Finally she\nlooked up and a nervous little laugh\naccompanied her words.\n\'That song is all that is left of ri\ncareer of which I once had fond\nhopes." By tho way in which her\nfingers caressed tho music Sunder\nland knew that something very dear\nhad been taken from her life.\n"My mother used to sing that\nsong, and when I found it in a second-hand\nshop I bought it and\nfound your name on it," he ex\nplained to her. "I went to the stu\ndios and found that you had gone.\nI wanted to trace you and ask you to\nsing it for me." Inez was silent a\nlong moment, then she looked up\nand met Sunderland\'s steady brown\neyes fixed upon her. There was\nsomething there that called for her\nconfidence.\n"I have not sung for a year,"\nshe told him. "I failed dismally at\nmy singing and was forced to sell\neverything I had. The songs, even,\nhad to go. . That is how you happen\nto have found this one." She smiled\nhalf wistfully; then her laugh\nchanged to reality. "But I have not\nfailed with my violets."\n"But you will sing for me?" Sun\nderland\'s voice was half entreaty,\nhalf command.\n"If you can stand a very rusty\nvoice I will be glad to," Inez\nagreed and felt suddenly very glad\nthat someone had commanded her to\nsing. A peculiar emotional sense\nhad taken possession of her. She\ndid not know whether it was the\nsight of her own song back again or\nwhether it was Sunderland.\nA critic would have known that\nthe girl\'s voice was not one \'for pub\nlic success, but to Sunderland it\nwas the most wonderful music that\nhad ever issued from a woman\'i\ntnroat. Aside irom naving wan\ndered suddenly into the love world\nhe was carried away by the familiar\nair of the song and the fairy legend\nof the words. He was back at his\nmother\'s side and she was singing\nto him. Enid Valentine had gone\nout of his life and Inez Claire had\nentered in.\nA moment later he looked up. He\nwas alone in the tiny room and Ine2\nwas out amoncr the violets. Sunder\nland arose and followed her,\nShe did not look up from the\nflowers when he stood beside her,\nbut went on cutting. A flush played\nabout her cheeks and she longed foi\nJimmy Dale to come -so that she\nwould not feel so uncertain of her\nself. "I am coming to see you tomor\nrow and the next day and the next,"\nSunderland was- saying, "and when\nI have been here a sufficient number\nof times am coinc to ask you to\nmarry me."\nInez looked up then with laughtei\nin her eyes. "I wonder how many\ndays will be sufficient?" she mused.\nHEARD AT THE BEACH-\nMr. Dubb Often when I look up\nat tho stars in the firmament I can\nnot help thinking how small, how\ninsignificant I am.\nMiss Keen Indeed!

Tho majority\nand this is not overstating tho fact\naro not yet prepared to pay a de-\n: cent prlco for stallion service, pre\nferring to use scrubs because they\n\' nro cheap.\nI Some of the states, have passed\nJ stallion laws containing soma excel-\nconso law which privents the provi\nA "Grade" Perchcron.\nienco nnd distribution of grado stal\nlions In tho state.\nMinnesota has a law framed along\ntho lines of tho Wisconsin measure.\nPennsylvania and Utah have adopt\ned similar laws and other states havo\nrestrictive measures under considera\ntion. The effect of those laws Is to make\nthe oyjaer of each non-registered stal\nlion declaro his horso a "grade." On\nhandbills that are posters so that no\nono may be deceived as .to his pedi\ngree. The situation abroad is very much\nbetter than in this country. In fact,\npractically no scrub, grade or non\nregistered stallions aro used for pub\nlis service.\nIn the investigations of this matter\ncarried on by Dr. A. S. Alexander of\nWisconsin It was found that of all\nthe stallions in the state, 60 per cent,\nwere grado stallions and only 40 per\ncent, puro bred.\nSome of the specimen, horses used\nfor public service aro remarkable ex\nhibitions of wretchedly bad, run\ndown and diseased animals. The illus\ntrations are from photographs of a\n"Grade Hambletonian" and a "Grado\nPercheron," which traveled through\nout tho state for service.
