Sores and Ulcers are\nthe result of morbid, unhealthy matter in the blood, and Rheumatism, Ca\ntarrh, Scrofula, Contagious Blood Poison, etc., are all deep-seated blood\ndisorders that will continue to grow worse as long as the poison remains.\nThese impurities and poisons find their way into the blood in various ways.\nOften a sluggish, inactive condition of the system, and torpid state of the\navenues of bodily wasto, leaves the refuse and waste matters to sour and\nform uric and other acids, which are taken up by the blood and distributed\nthroughout the circulation. Coming in contact with contagious diseases is\nanother cause for the poisoning of the blood ; we also breathe the germs and\nmicrobes of Malaria into our lungs, and when these get into the blood in\nsufficient quantity it becomes a carrier of disease instead of health. Some\nnre so unfortunate as to inherit bad blood, perhaps the dregs of some old\nconstitutional disease of ancestors is handed down to them and they are\nconstantly annoyed and troubled with it. Bad blood is the source of all dis\nease, and until this vital fluid is cleansed and purified the body is sure to\nsuffer in some way. For blood troubles of any character S. S. S. is the best\nremedy ever discovered. It goes down into the circulation and removes any\nand all poisons, supplies the healthful properties it needs, and completely\nand permanently cures blood diseases of\nevery kind. The action of S.

It Is about 30 years\nelnco tho Germans acquired tho vast\nregion now known as German East\nAfrica. They had no Idea then that\nany part of tho colony, which is only a\nlittle south of tho equator, could over\nbecomo tho homo of whito settlers.\nMuch to their surprise, they havo\nfound that about a sixth of tho coun\ntry is so rich In soil and stands so\nhigh, above tho sea that white men\nmay engage in manual labor thoro tho\nyear around.\nTho regions that Invite white col\nonization aro distributed in largo and\nsmall areas among tho Usambara\nmountains, near tho sea; on tho vast,\nhigh plain south and west of Mount\nKilimanjaro; in tho mountains and\nrich Valleys of Uhoho to tho south\nwest; on tho high tablelands of Urun\ndi and Ruanda near tho Congo Free\nBtato and In other districts. Already\nabout 2,000 peasants from Germany\nand tho Transvaal havo settled there,\nthough It was only last year that Ger\nmany got ready to admit colonists.\nIn somo places thoro aro only two\nor three settlers, while In other re\ngions there are scores of families. It\nis still an untamed wilderness and\nGermany holds out no glittering\' in\nducements. In tho circular of the colonial gov\nvernment last year colonists were told\nthat they would bo accepted only if\nthey were well, strong and temperate.\nThey must bo propared to endure\nbravely tho privations inseparable\nfrom pioneer life. There was little\nprospect of acquiring wealth, but tho\ndiligent man could make a homo for\nhimself and his family and become In\ndependent. The great regions of Urundi and\nRuanda, tho most populous parts of\nGerman East Africa, about 800 miles\nfrom tho Indian ocean, aro not yet\nopen to settlement, as orderly rela\ntions with the natives are not yot fully\nestablished. These aro tho only re\ngions adapted for whito occupancy\nthat aro not yet accessible to colon\nists. Tho government will ultimately sell\nthe land, but at present It is leased\nto settlers for a few cents an aero. As\nsoon as the settler has one-tenth of his\nholding under cultivation or otherwise\ndevoted to useful purposes, ho is en\ntitled to purchase twice as much\nland "as ho has improved at about 10\nor 20 conts an acre.\nTho government requires all settlers\nto bring at least 9500 into tho coun\ntry. Thoy must pnddlo their own\ncanoe In a financial wv.\nIt Is a little different, however, with\ntho German Poles, who aro as yet\ntho chief Gorman immigrants. For\neach family a llttlo cabin and two\nouthouses aro constructed, a few cat\ntle and somo farming Implements aro\nprovided and tho government Is reim\nbursed In small regular payments.\nAll tho settlors llvo In small cabins\nbuilt of wood, stono or tiles. Many of\nthem give most attontlon to tho rais\ning of cattle, sheep and goats, and\nproduco only sufficient crops to feed\ntheir families.\nTho Germans havo been greatly\nsurprised to find how largo a variety\nof European farm crops can bo grown\non theso wide-spreading lands from\n4,000 to 7,000 feot abovo tho sea. Somo\n! r &b\nGerman Post 450 Miles Inland.\nsettlers aro actually raising wheat as\nfine as any land produces.\nWheat is destined to bo a great\ncrop, 800 miles Inland, In tho region\nof tho central African lakes. The first\ncrop sown on tho second plowing of\ntho land yielded about 40 bushels to\nthe acre, tho only trouble being that\nIt ripened in patches, so that a wholo\nfield could not bo cut at once.\nEuropean vegetables grow finely,\nsmall fruits do well and cotton and\ntobacco aro an assured success. Mil\nlions of coffeo trees havo been planted,\ntobacco and sugar cano thrive and\nsisal" hemp Introduced from Yucatan\non tho government experimental\nfarms several years Is already an im\nportant export.\nTho Whito settlers all over German\nEast Africa aro loudly protesting\nagainst the tardy development of the\nrailroad system, planned several years\nago. Letters from colonists on Vic\ntoria Nyanza say It is a disgrace to\ntho German flag that they havo to\nsend their products to tho sea by tho\nBritish steamers and railroad.\nTheso protests aro producing somo\neffect and thero aro signs that rail\nroad building will soon bo pushed\nwith some degreo of vigor.\nEVARTS A GREAT WAG.\nSome Instances of the Brilliancy of\nHis Wit.\nHon. William M. Evarts, secrotary\nof state during President Hayes\' ad\nministration, was celebrated not only\nas a statesman and a lawyer, but also\nas a great wit.\nOn ono occasion he was at a large\nstag dinner given by Edward Potter\nin New York. Tho five Potter broth\ners were among tho numerous dinner\nguests.\nToward the end of tho dinner Mr.\nEvarts was called on for a speech, to\nwhich ho responded:\n"As I look around this table, I am\nreminded of a story of a young Pres\nbyterian divine, recently licensed to\npreach, who was holding his first\neervlce.\n"In leading tho first prayer tho\nnorvous young clergyman began:\n"\'Wo thank theo, oh. Lord\' Ho\nstopped, cleared his throat, and then\nwent on:\n\' " \'Wo thank theo, oh, Lord\'\n"Again ho paused, and then in des\nperation said:\n"\'Wo thank Theo, oh Lord, that\nThou art tho Clay and wo aro tho\nPotters!"\'\nTho guests wero convulsed, and hh\nspeech was an instantaneous hit, al\nthough none but Mr. Evarts would\nhavo dared to do It.\nOn ono of his trips abroad \' Mr.\nEvarts landed at Liverpool. The\nsteamor was proceeding slowly up the\nriver to tho wharf, and Mr. Evarts\nwas standing on dock, looking medi\ntatively at tho muddy waters of tho\nMersey.\nSuddenly ho turned to his com\npanion, and with a quizzical gleam in\nhis eyo said:\n"Evidently \'tho quality of Mercy is\nnot strained.\' "Washington Post.\nGovernor Frank Frantz has moro\nwatches probably than any othor man\nin Oklahoma. But\' they aro not costly\nones. Thoy aro tho kind that cost a\n(\'jollar each, and aro "warranted to\nkeep correct tlmo for a year." His\ncostly and hotter watch bo keeps at\nhomo In a \'bureau drawer. Ho holloves\nit is cheaper to carry a dollar watch\nthan it Is to own a high-priced time\npleco. If tho cheap watch Is broken,\ntho loss is slight, and another is easily\nobtained.\nTho first political speech ever mado\nby Governor Frantz was at Ada, I. T.,\nshortly after ho became governor. Ho\ndoos not claim to bo "all tho candy"\nas an orator, and was considerably\ndisturbed as to what he should say\nand how ho should say It. Ho grew\nrather nervous at his hotel, waiting\nfor tho hour when ho should begin,\nand reaching Into his vest pocket drew\nout ono of his "tin" watches and\nlooked at It. A moment later ho drew\nanother "tin" watch from his coat\npocket, looked at tho slowly moving\nhands, and" replaced It. A third tlmo\nho looked at a watch, this one coming\nfrom his trouser\'s pocket.\nA traveling man sitting In the hotel\nwas looking at tho performance curi\nously. Addressing Frantz, the strang\ner said: "I do not wish to bo lnqusl\ntlve, but really I would Hko to know\nwhy you carry so many watches, gov\nernor." \'That\'s easy," replied tho\ngovernor with a twinkle In his eye;\n"I want to got all tho \'tlmo\' possible\nto mako this speech."\nUnder statehood tho crimo against\ntho foderal statutes of boot-legging\nwhisky among Indians will "becomo\npractically obsolete. Tho traffic has\nbeen troublesome for years In both\nOklahoma and Indian Torrltory, most\nof tho defendants on tho court dock\nets having been persons charged with\nboot-legging. Tho federal statutes\nprovide that Intoxicants may not bo\nsold to an Indian who has not takon\nhis allotment of land, and whoso\ntribal relations havo not been dis\nsolved. This statutes has been hold\nvalid in tho face of a later act of\ncongress declaring the Indian to be an\nAmerican citizen, with tho right to\nvote, etc.\nPractically all tho Indians In Okla\nhoma and Indian Territory havo takon\ntheir allotments, and with the coming\nof statehood tholr tribal relations will\nbo dissolved, and tholr tribal govern\nments pass cut of oxistonco. Intoxi\ncants then may bo sold to Indians\nwithout running Into tho noose of\nfederal law.\nThe boot-logger wfll llvo and flourish\nas In other days, however, tho state,\nInstead of the federal government,\nbeing his prosecutor. Under the\nterms of tho enabling act, tho state\nobligates Itself to enforce prohibition\nin tho Indian Territory portion of tho\nstate. Tho \'boot-logger will bo thoro\nwith his contraband traffic.\nBefore another Issuo of this news\npaper appears, tho foderal patronage\nIn Oklahoma undur statehood may\nhavo been dispensed by Prosldent\nRoosovolt. All tho candidates are in\nWashington, engaged" In a final strug\ngle for individual eupromncy. Street\ngossip is unreliable, but at Guthrie the\nair Is flllod with stories that seem\nto carry dl crod it to a number of the\ncandidates. It would seonr as if there\nwas no way of gottlng an appoint\nment to a foderal position without be\ncoming a suppliant to tho corpora\ntions. The frionds of this and that\ncandidates boast that thoy will win\nbecause this or that railroad company\nhas thrown all its influence to their\nman. Evon the Standard OH company\nis alleged to bo in the gamo.\nEvery houso-koopor In Oklahoma\nhas found In tho last two years that\ntho servant quostlon has grown moro\nannoying than oven tho Increasing\nprice of grocorles. Six or seven\nyears ago It was posslblo to omploy\nnogro sorvnnts at reasonablo prices.\nNow, however, tho nogro servant do\nmanda twice as much as was naked\nIn earllor years, nnd tho cook rofuscs\nto do tho washing and tho laundress\nrefuses to do the cooking, making\ntho Increase about four times greater\nthan tho original wages.\nTho domand for cotton pickers, and\ntho high prico paid for picking, en\nabling women nnd even girls to mako\nas much In two days ns formorly thoy\nearned In n week is largely respon\nsible for tho changed condition. In\nsomo of tho larger towns In tho now\nstate nogro domestics havo formed a\n"union" In an effort to maintain a\nscale of wages. Tho minimum prico\nis about flftoon conts an hour, In\ncluding moala. Many times it la dif\nficulty to got domestics, oven at this\nprico, and housewives unaccustomed\nto such work, havo been compolled in\nmany instances this fall to stand over\ntholr own washtubs.\nBut a small ray of light has shown\nIn tho darkness, that hiay load to an\nabundance of Tollable help at reason\nablo prices. Scores of Japanese labor\ners camo to tho cotton fields of Okla\nhoma this fall. Thoy aro Industrious\nand eager to learn American ways.\nA plan is undor way to Induce theso\nmen to remain In Oklahoma during\nthe wlntor months as homo servants.\nMost of them havo to bo taught how\nto do laundry work, and cook, but\nthey aro quick to loarn, nnd aftor\nbeing taught mako admlrablo ser\nvants. This plan has been tried in\nmany Nebraska towns with success.\nTho Japanese field laborer in Ne\nbraska, upon changing from ffcild work\nto houso work, is satisfied with $15 a\nmonth and his board.\nTho conti acting agont for theso\nJapanese in Oklahoma lives at Okla\nhoma City, and has been asked to es\ntablish an agoncy for Japanese ser\nvants In Oklahoma.\nSo many inquiries aro received at\ntho offlco of tho governor of Okla\nhoma, concerning tho legal fees that\nmay bo chargod by notaries public,\nthat Governor Frantz lately Issued a\npublic letter of Information. Many of\ntho inquiries wero complaints against\ntho charging of oxcosslvo fees. Gov\nornor Frantz said:\nTho Fee and Salary act of 1897 Is\ntho act fixing tho compensation to\nwhich notaries public aro ontltled for\nsorvlcos, and specifically sot forth in\nSection 39 of Chapter 15, Session\nLaws of 1897. Section 39 reads as fol\nlows: ,\nFor protest and record of tho same\n25 conts.\nFor each notice of protost, 10 conts.\nFor certificate and seal, 25 cents.\nFor all other services, tho samo\nfoes as are allowed to tho clerk of tho\ndistrict court for llko sorvlcos.\nTho attorney general, In an opin\nion to mo under dato of January 15,\n1907,, reaffirms an opinion by formor\nAttorney P.
