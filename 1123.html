Melt retardation has also beening of the snow observed in all of our manure treatments.\nThis slow-down of melting was not as pronounced in commonly observed in snow-covered fields overlain by\nthick accumulations of surface dust (Drake, 1980; Os-partially manured plots as in the heavily manured ones.\nIn partially manured plots, however, the spreading pat- trem, 1959). Ostrem (1959) found that the switch from\nadvancing of melt rates to retardation occurred at a dusttern was important. We observed that melt retardation\nwas more pronounced in snow beneath the largest (15 thickness of 0.5 cm, a phenomenon explained by Drake’s\n(1980) simplified, energy balance model.

A likely explanation of this\nphenomenon is that small manure patches have a high work showed that changes caused to the surface albedo\nand temperature by albedo-reducing materials on topratio of perimeter to area, compared with big patches.\nRadiant and sensible heat from the perimeter edges of snow were both important to predicting whether\nsnowmelt is retarded or advanced.melts snow adjacent and beneath, so snow beneath small\npatches disappears more rapidly than from beneath\nlarger patches. CONCLUSIONS\nThe above analyses explained melt retardation by the\nManure landspreading experiments conducted in Ar-insulating effect of the manure, so a discussion on the\nlington, WI during the winters of 1998 and 1999 showedthermal properties of manure is important. The thermal\nthat solid dairy manure containing cornstalks applied onconductivity of manure measured on our plots (Table\ntop of snow retarded melt, in proportion to the manure2) was comparable with others reported in literature\napplied. This retardation was caused by manure acting(e.g., Bohnhoff, 1985) and of the same order of magnias\nan insulator.
