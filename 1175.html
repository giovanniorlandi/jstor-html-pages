The\nother points at which he spoke during\nthe day were: Schenectady, Fonda,\nJohnstown, Millersville, Amsterdam,\nPortplain, Little Falls, Herkimer, Ilion,\nFrankfort, Utica, Rome, Oneida, Canas\ntota and Dewitt. The attendance at a\nmajority of the meetings was compli\nmentary and some of the audiences were\nvery large. He was given close atten\ntion and in no case was there any in\nterruption. The crowd at Oswego was\nthe biggest and in other respects the\nmost notable of the day.\nKALISPELL\'S CURFEW LAW.\nTile Bogie Mail May Get After the Hoy.\nand Girl*.\nFor the benifit of parents and guard\nians as well as boys and girls under the\nage of sixteen, Sections 15 and 16, Arti\ncle 2. of the revised ordinances of Kalis\npell is given.\n"Section 15.

Ponsford of\nBozeman, one of the best democrats in\nthe state of Montana, was at the McDer\nmott yesterday. He is taking an active\npart in the campaign this fall and is\nconfident of victory for the Independent\ndemocrats. "I hardly see how we can\nlose the state," said he. "To begin with,\nwe have nearly every prominent demo\ncrat on our side, nearly every state offi\ncer, from governor down, is with us, and\nall the old war horses are pulling true.\nWhat they think about the campaign\nmust be a good index to what others are\nthinking and I see plenty of evidences of\nvictory down in Gallatin county."\nYOUTSEÏ\'S TRIAI. CLOSING.\nEvidence In, Jury Instructed—HI* Con\ndition not Improved.\nSpecial to the Bee.\nGeorgetown, Ky., Oct. 18.—The Yout\nsey trial is drawing rapidly to a close.\nAll the testimony is in, the instructions\nhave been given to the jury and speeches\nare being made.

The attacks are intolerable. The\nrepairing linemen cannot leave the gar\nrison without a considerable escort. The\nonly remedy seems to be to corral all the\nburghers and deport them, as apparently\nnone of them can be conciliated.\nMOST SUCCESSFUL VET.\nAnti-Bribery Rally at Great Falla 1* a\nHammer.\nSpecial to the Bee.\nGreat Falls, Oct. 18.—The meeting of\nlast night, which opened the Independ\nent democratic campaign in this city,\nwas the most successfull political meet\ning yet held by any party during the\npresent campaign, Those who gathered\nto. hear the speaking derived genuine\npleasure from listening to Montana sil\nver champion, Hon. Charles S. Hartman\nand the earnestness with which he\nbrought out the justice of the cause of\nthe Independent democracy seemed to\npenetrate their very souls.\nYELLOWSTONE PARK RAILROAD.\nIncorporatetl at Trenton, N.

The train is known as the first\nsection of No. 1 and left Missoula this\nafternoon at 5 o\'clock for the west.\nThe place where the wreck occurred is\na straight piece of road and what caused\nthe wreck is not known now.\nThe engine. No. 31, in charge of Engi\nneer Ryan and Fireman Dylsse, is turned\nover and both men are badly hurt. The\ntrain was made up of a mail, two bag\ngage and an express car, and was in\ncharge of Conductor Chamberlain of\nthis city. The head brakeman, Har\ngrave, is also reported to be badly hurt,\nThe other cars are either piled up in a\nheap or on the track in a demoralized\ncondition.\nGov. Toole\'s Stock Speech.\nFor handy reference, the Anaconda\nStandard has condensed the stock speech\nthat the Hon. Joseph K. Toole is making\nthis fall in Montana. Possibly some of\nMr. Toole\'s polite euphemisms have been\ncouched in language more commonplace\nthan this polished and scholarly orator\nuses on the platform, but he will not\ndeny that his main arguments and, in\ngeneral, his trend of thought have been\ncarefully preserved. Mr. Toole says:\n"There is no longer room for denial\nthat there exists a political conspiracy\nbetween the Amalgamated Copper com\npany and a small party of unprincipled\nscoundrels to destroy Montana and re\nduce its people to perpetual slavery.\nGentlemen, be not deceived. They tell\nus that the Amalgamated Copper com\npany employs 8000 men in Montana and\npays them the highest rate of wages in\nthe United States; that it gets along\namicably with its men and is never\nknown to be troubled with strikes, lock\nouts or labor difficulties of any kind;\nthat it equips all its mines and works\nwith the best possible appliances for the\nprevention of injury; that if any man is\nhurt in its employ it does not wait to be\nsued for damages, but endeavors to effect\na prompt and satisfactory settlement;\nthat more than any other one institution\nit has developed and is developing the\nresources of Montana and is ever con\ntributing to its prosperity and happiness\nand ever standing with the people in a\nplot to prevent the election of judges\nwho will hand down to Heinze decisions\nwritten by himself. To all of which I\nanswer, kerosene!\n"Ah, gentlemen, this hydra-headed,\nmonstrous octopus, spurting rivers of\noil from its forty nostrils, and breathing\nfire and brimstone from its hundred\nmouths, crushing everything before it\nunder the relentless tread of its thousand\niron heels, and demolishing everything\nbehind it with its myriads of deadly\ntails; this fanged and fiery dragon rear\ning itself aloft from out of the seething\ndepths of hell, and pouncing all-ablaze\nupon horrified humanity as its prey;\nthis apocalytical beast of the bottomless\npit, whose every hair is a venomous\nviper and every eyelash a coiling, curl\ning, darting scorpion; this foul and vi\n[Continued on Fourth Page.]\nMURDER AT BIG FORK\nJas. J. Patton Rune a Knife Through\nThe Heart Of\nONE OF HIS FELLOW WORKMEN\nSequel of a Drunken Row.—Murderer Is Captured\nJailed.—Only One Eye Witness.—Coroner\'s\nInquest.\nand\nP. F. Carroll, a big, good natured\nIrishman, known by all his fellow work\nmen and employers as "Pat," in the em\nploy of Fair Brother\'s contractors on the\nconstruction work of the Big Fork Elec\ntrie Power and Light Companies\' plant,\non Swan river was murdered in cold\nblood between 11 and 12 o\'clock Tuesday\nnight, by James J. Patton, a cook.\nPatton then endeavored to make his\ncrime a double murder and was only pre\nvented by the sudden flight of his in\ntended second victim. Albert Goarel.e.\nThe crime was committed a few hund\nred yards east of the bridge over Swan\nriver, near Flathead lake, at a point\nwhere Fair Brothers have established a\nboarding camp for the men in their em\nploy, and there was but one known\nwitness of the crime, Albert GoarcLe.\nHis story was told in a manner ivL c\nthoroughly convinced of its truth and\nand which did not vary materially when\nrepeated by him before a coroner\'s jury.\nHe said: "Pat" Carroll, the murdered\nman, was about 27 years of age and I\nunderstand his home was at Brown\'s\nHon. C. S. Hartman\nAT THE\nOPERA HOUSE\nTomorrow Night.\nValley, Minnesota. I have known him\nabout three months, during which time\nwo had been in the employ of Fair\nBrothers. The cause of the trouble\nwhich resulted in the murder occurred\na number of days ago.\nPat had been accused by Patton of\ntale bearing about the men, to the Tink\nel\'s and Fair\'s and there was a little\ntrouble last Sunday night. Tuesday\nnight W. G. McDonald, Ed Laport, my\nself and the murdered man, with pos\nsibly a few others, were at the saloon,\njust accross the bridge and which we\nknow as Mr. Sliter\'s saloon. We took\ntwo or three drinks, and McDonald, who\nwas drunk, and Carroll became involved\nin a quarel and McDonald mixed it\nup with Pat, who had the best of the\nfight. However, the trouble was settied,\nand Carroll and myself started to camp\nwith McDonald and Laport who were\nnot in a condition to care for themselves,\nowing to drink. We put them both in bed\nand were standing near the cook house\ntalking quietly. While we were con\nversing Patton, who had been drinking\nall day and was drunk when I had last\nseen him, possibly about 9 o\'clock, threw\nopen the door and coming out said:\nYou--, what do you mean? Car\nroll laughingly approached Patton, offer\ning an apology. The first I knew,\nPatton had made a lunge. I saw a\nknife, which was over a loot long, and\nsaw him stab Carroll. The knife entered\nthe left breast. Carroii whirled around,\nstaggered, took a few steps and sank to\nthe ground, moaning "I am killed." I\naroused the men in the bunk house and\nthen went to the tent of Mr. and Mrs.\nFair, intending to arouse them. I was\nstanding in the door, when Patton came\nup behind me and said: "Get out ol\nthere." I took his word for it and took\nto the woods—"I got."\nMr. Fair said: I had been asleep and\nwas awakened by some one, who was\nsaying Pat Carroll has been murdered.\nIt was about this time Patton forced his\nway into the tent occupied by Mrs. Fail\nand myself and demanded that I jit once\ngive him his money. He was aruicd\nwith a pick handle and his manner was\nthat of a crazy man, probably crazj\ndrunk. As near as I can remember Pat\nton said:\' \'You----- Ï must\nhave it. I have a wife and two children\nin Idaho. I have stabbed Pat and must\nget away. I want a horse and I must\nhave it. I wan\'t to get away." Of course\nI refused all his demands, but that for\nhis money, which I gave him. He ran\nfrom the tent, grabbing my hat as he ran.\nI then dressed and went to the sleeping\nhouse and there found the men sur\nrounding Pat Carroll, who was laying on\nthe ground dead. The men were great\na\n.\nI\nly enraged and had Patton, who had\nvanished, been caught they would have\nmade quick work of him."\nThe country was searched liy a large\nnumber of armed men all night. A man\nhad been stationed at the ferry at Holt.\nEarly in the morning ratton approached\nand requested to he put accross the river,\nbut Paul Smith detained him in conversa\ntion while word was being taken to the\nposse that Patton was at Holt. While\nhe was waiting he steed that he bad\nkilled a man, and d.d nu t seem to realize\nthe seriousness of his crime, but said\nthat he desired togo to Kalispell and give\nhiir.slf up, as his lite was in danger. A\npcsse consisting of Messrs. Engle, Wicks.\nSliter and Neadreau soon arrived and\nplaced him under arrest, they at once\nstarted for Kalispell with their prisoner,\nwho was safely landed in jail. The\ncorpse of the murdered man was brought\nto ti e city late in the afternoon by Coro\nner McMahon and an inquest and post\nmortem examination held at 10 o\'clock\nVA ednesdsy night. Only one witness\nwas examined, Albert Goarehe, who\nwas the only witness of the crime. Dr.\nMcNieee made the examination, and his\nreport in part says:\nThe body was covered with blood from\nthe neck over the front part of the body\nto the ankle on the right leg. The ex\nternal wounds located on the left side of\nthe chest one and one-half inches from\nthe inside of the nipple, between the\nfourth and fifth rib. The contents of\nthe chest when examined exposed to view\nthe pericardium torn and displayed a\nwound on the anterior surface of the\nleft veutricle of the heart one and\nonc-hulf inches long and ono and\none-fourth inches long at the point of exit\nand confined to the muscles of the\nheart."\nThe coroner\'s jury, which was com\nposed of John H. C. Fitch, George Borg\nmann. George F, Stannard, George\nAvery, Lee Kerr and Fred Russell after\nhearing all evidence submitted decided\nthat Carroll, came to his death by means\nof knife wound inflicted by J. J. Patton.\nEdward Laport and W. G, McDonald,\nthe two men whom Carroll had assisted\nin placing in bed, were in such a state of\nintoxication that they could not he\naround until late the next morning.\nMr. A. Fair in describing Patton and\nhis actions after the murder said: "Pat\nton acted like a person insanely angry,\nHe stated that a mob had broke into the\ncook room door and were playing h—1.\nI stabbed one." I said to him, you\ndid not kill him? and Patton auswerod\n"I think I ran the knife clear through\nhim. I stabbed Pat."\nWm. Engle, who assisted in making\nthe arrest of tho murderer said: We\nwere notified that Patton was at Holt\nand at once proceeded to that point,\nwhere we found him talking to Paul\nSmith. Patton was ordered to throw up\nhis hands and quickly did so, saying.\n"Don\'t shoot!" Wo searched him a: d\nwhile doing so he asked if Pat was dead,\nreferring to Carroll, when informed t!iu\nhe was. He said: "Well Le was raisi.q\ntrouble, licked my cook last night anc\nhas been trying to run tho cook house\nand mo. I won\'t allow any man to run\nmy cook house."\nConstable Neudre i at .1 Frank Wicks\nwho brought the | .isci er into the ein\nsay that l.e jok\' d and talked cf tin\ntrouble and that he seemed to cure ven\nlittleaLout the crime. At one time aficr\n,ic had been telling us what he had done,\nae said: "You can tell what I have told\nyou, but if you swear to a lie I\'ll follow\nyou up and kill you both. I am sorry he\n.s dead, lie should have been killed ten\nyears ago. No--can go into a\njook shack of mine."\nTkero seems to be much bad feeling\namong some of the men and also a tend\nency to shield Patton by a few of his\nfriends, but those who defend him are\nreported by responsible witnesses to have\nbeen as drunk as Patton seems to have\nbeen, and in no condition to know any\nthing of the crime.\nA number of witnesses in the case\nwero brought to the city yesterday and\naro being held to give their testimony\nbefore the preliminary examination be\ning held, this afternoon before Justice\nBillings.\nA\nof\nof\na\nof\nd\na\nBETWEEN HOGAN AND KOI.SO.VI.\nHon. Joseph. K. Toole Not In the Govern\norship Rare.\nSpecial to the Bee.\nButte Oct. 18.—-W. Poindexter came\nin from Helena last night and will leave\nthis morning for Beaverhead county.\nThere is one remark I hear repeated\nall over the state, where I have been, he\nsaid. It is this: The fight is between\nthe Independent democrats and the re\npublicans. This is what the people say\nand all observing men know it to be the\ntruth. Tho fight is between Hogan and\nFolsom, Kelley and Murray, and so on\ndown in both tickets. There is no hope\nthat I can see for the fusionists, and I\nhear no one say that there is.\nTom Long Pleads Guilty.\nSpecial to tho Boe.\nMissoula, Oct. 18.—Thomas Long in\nthe district court today pleaded guilty\nto tho charge of manslaughter for the\nkilling of Louio Radigan one day last\nJuly by throwing him into the Missoula\nNTHUSIASTIC\nRousing Independent Demo\ncratic Rally in Butte.\nMATTS WAS ORATOR\nTremendous Crowd Present and The\nGreatest Enthusiasm\nManifested.\nSpecial to the Bee.\nButte, Oct. 18.—Touignts opening\nrally in Silver Bow county of the In\ndependent democrats was a rouser\nfor enthusiasm, for the size of the\ncrowd in atendance, for hearty spirit\nand splendid oratory. It makes a\nrecord in Butte for the campaign, and\nit will be long indeed before a political\nmeeting of the other parties in this\ncity can surpass it. The meeting dem\nonstrated that the Independent dem\nocrats are not to be numbered in this\ncounty by the handfulls, but by the\nthousands. There was not a bit of\nroom to spare in the auditorum last\nnight, the hall was well filled early,\nand by the time the speaking began\nthere was no room to be had. Look\ning back from the platform the aud\'\nience was a magnifleient one, every\nseat was taken and great crowds filled\nthe space in the back of the hall, eager\nto hear the distinguished orators of\nthe occasion. A little after eight\no\'clock a number of prominent citizens\nwalked upon the stage with the\nspeaker of the evening, Senator E.\nD. Matts of Deer Lodge county\nAmong those on the stage were\nHenry Muller, Mayor J. H. McCarthy,\nJames H. Lynch, Dr. W. H. Haviland,\nE. Goelfery Lavelle, Hon. J. C. Camp\nbell, Donate Dorais, J. E. Morgan, J.\nG . Holland, Judge Nichols, Roy\nSalley, J. D. Murphy, E. C. Boome,\nProf, beamy, C. C. Clark, Benard Noon\nand others. Henry Muller one of the\noldest and most prominent democrats\nof the county, acted as chairman of\nthe meeting. Mr. Matts received an\novation on rising to address the\naudience,and no speaker during the\ncampaign nas been listened to with\ncloser attention than which was\ngiven Senator Matts this evening,\nat frequent intervals he was given\napplause that was uproarious.\nSTATE NEWS.\nA case of smallpox has been discovered\nat Livingston.\nTho state auditor has more than 300\nunclaimed wolf bounty warrants, which\nwero issued previous to 1893.\nThe Montana Central has commenced\nlaying track from tho Teton end of the\ntort Benton cut off, which is expected\no l-e finished soon.\nLauren M.

MARONEY\nRefusing to Stump for Bryan Because of\nHis Connection With the North\nern Pacific Railway.\nIt was a great crowd that turned out\nto hear J. K. Toole at the opera house\nTuesday night. The house was full to\noverflowing and there is not the slightest\ndoubt that the large attendance was a\ncompliment to Hon. Joseph K. Toole\nwhom, heretofore, every citizen of Mon\ntana has delighted to honor. Tho people\nof Kalispell in common with the rest of\nthe citizens of this state were anxious to\nhoar what explanation, if any, Mr. Toole\nhad to offer for refusing, then taking, by\ntho fraudulent connivance of Messrs.\nBliss and Cooper, the nomination for the\ngovernorship upon a platform endorsing\nthe most notorious briber in tùe history\nof the nation. But those who expected\nsuch an explanation wero disappointed.\nNotwithstanding that Mr. Toole has\nbeen assailing the Amalgamated Copper\ncompany wherever he has spoken here\ntofore during this campaign, he was as\nsilent as the grave about it Tuesday\nnight.\nTho meeting was called to order about\n8 o\'clock by Chairman Pratt. There\nwere only well-known Clark democrats\non the stage and few of them. Mr. Pratt\nintroduced ono Donovan of Great Falls,\nwho is running for the office of attorney\ngeneral on the bribery ticket. Donovan\nis a populist leader and has a most un\nsavory reputation where he is best\nknown. Ho is generally regarded as well\nqualified to do tho Clark dirty work and\nhe maintained his reputation in that re\nspect in his address Tuesday night. He\nis a fairly good speaker and while he\nconfined himself to national issues he\ndid very well, hut grew tiresome toward\nthe last. As a finale he. abused the\nAnti-Bribery Democrats and Governor\nSmith in particular. Ho asked if the\npeople wero not proud of Governor\nSmith, and when there was a shout of\n"yes" from the audience the boodle ad\nvocate grew red in tho face and more\nfilthy in his remarks; so filthy, in fact,\nthat at least one of the men on the stage\narose and left. When he mentioned\nFred Whiteside\'s name there was a shout\nof applause, and when he had theshame\nlessness to announce that he indorsed\nClark, there were groans and hisses from\nall over the house. On the whole, Don\novan\'s speech did the Clark ticket vastly\nmore harm than good, and if Chairman\nCooper is well advised he will pull the\nfoul mouthed blatherskite off the stump.\nThe crowd had unquestionably turned\nout in compliment to Ex-Governor Toole\nand when ho was introduced there was\nloud and prolonged applause. The peo\nple of Montana have many pleasant re\nmembrances of him. The old-timers\nespecially hold him in high esteem, and\nthere were many of them in tho audience.\nThe governor\'s stylo was in pleasant\ncontrast to that of Donovan. He was\npolished, scholarly, good humored and\ncourteous. Ho scored tho trusts and\neven said a good word for free coinage.\nComing down to state affairs he paid\ntribute to Candidate Folsom. He rather\nastonished his audience by stating with\nemphasis that in his judgment the anti\nClark delegation from Silver Bow county\nto tho state convention was unjustly de\nprived of seats in that body, but he said\nhe knew of no rule for the guidance of\npolitical parties but tho rule of the ma\njority and said the Silvor Bow delegation\nshould have abided the action of the\nconvention, unjnst and unfair as it was.\nThe speaker made no attempt to suggest\na remedy for the 5000 Silver Bow demo\ncrats who were displaced by the 400\nClarkites. If the action of the state\nconvention was to be quietly endured,\nwhat is to prevent the minority in any\ncounty sending a contesting delegation\nknowing that they wifi be seated by a\npartisan credentials committee appointed\nby a partisan temporary chairman chosen\nby a partisan central committee? The\naction of the Silver Bow Clarkites struck\nat the very foundation of majority rule,\nbut Mr. Toole had no word of condemna\ntion for them. It is only when the brib\nery forces are in the majority that the\nminority should acquiesce, according to\nMr. Toole\'s reasoning. The speaker\nnever once mentioned the Amalgamated\nCopper company, which he has been be\nlaboring so vigorously in other parts of\nthe state. In his admission that all cor\nporations are not necessarily trusts or all\ntrusts necessarily corporations, but that\nmonopolies only are dangerous and vi\ncious, he knocked out the underpinning\n[Continued on Fourth Page.]', 'The Kalispell Bee.\nWalt®* Aitkev, I T.

Burnes on the Inde\npendent democratic ticket, is a gentle\nman who has been an honored citizen of\nKalispell for a number of years past.\nThere could hardly have been a better\nselection and his candidacy adds strength\nto the ticket. Mr. Bjorneby is an un\ncompromising foe to the Clark method\nin politics as well as to ring rule in\ncounty conventions. He, with the other\ncandidates on tho legislative ticket,\nstands for a higher standard of political\nmorality and for a legislative course\nwhich makes the selection of a United\nStates senator secondary to the interests\nof his constituents. He asks and ex\npects the support of all who condemn\nthe Clark political scheme, and his per\nsonality and reputation are such that\nthe people can trust him. Incidentally,\nthe canvass of the Independent republi\ncan legislative candidates is meeting\nwith a favor that augurs success at the\npolls. The Clark contention that every\nman has his price is likely to be dis\nproved in a decisive manner. The can\ndidacy of the Independent democratic\nnominees is a protest against the wrong\ndoing of all parties and individuals.\nThey stand first for the purification of\nthe ballot and then for all good things\nthat can be added unto that.\nThe voters of this county should not\nforget that among other propositions to\nbe submitted to them at the forthcoming\nelection will be one to arrange for the\nerection of a county courthouse. The\npresent quarters of the county govern\nment are not creditable. They are dingy\nand dirty and inconvenient. They are\nalso expensive. The rent of the present\ncounty offices would pay the interest on\n$55,000 and enough over to almost pro\nvide a sinking fund to pay the bonds at\ntheir maturity. It doesn\'t require much\nof a head for figures to appreciate the\neconomy of the county owning its own\noffices. Besides, the present jail is a dis\ngrace to the county and a standing men\nace to the safety of every prisoner con\nfined therein. It is a fire-trap of the\nworst description. Counties which own\ntheir own courthouses are more than\npleased with their investment. From\nevery consideration of economy, self\nrespect and justice, the proposition to\nbond the county for §55,000 to provide a\nsuitable courthouse and jail, should\ncarry.__\nJ$lt is currently reported that the cam\npaign expenses of the Independent dem\nocrats are being paid by Whiteside and\nhis backers, with something thrown in\non the side. The Bee asked how much\nit would take to buy Dr. Macdonald.\nNow let the Bee answer its own question.\nHow much was required?—The Local\nBribery Organ.\nIt is currently known that as a lying\nand blackmailing sheet the Herald\nJournal has no superior all over Mon\ntana, and that is saying a good deal.\nThere is not a citizen of this county, no\nmatter how spotless his reputation, who\nmay consider himself immune from the\nmud-slinging attacks of the Herald\nJournal if he makes any effort to defeat\nthe ends of the bribery brigade. Doctor\nMacdonald is known all over this county\nas a gentleman of unsullied character\nand unimpeachable integrity, and no\nattack of a gutter-snipe, editorial-space\nselling sheet of the Herald Journal stamp\ncan in any way injure him. In fact, it\nmay be questioned if such attacks do\nnot help him. For twenty-five dollars\nDoctor Macdonald could probably pur\nchase a half column of editorial approba\ntion in tho Herald Journal to run from\nnow until election day, but it will ad\nvance his canvass more if he can induce\ntho bribery organ to continue its attacks.\nSo long as he deserves the esteem of\nhonest men Doctor Macdonald may rely\nupon the censure of Briber Clark\'s news\npaper representative in Kalispell.\nTho legislative candidates on the Clark\nticket are respectfully informed that the\nBee has no desire to commence a cam\npaign of personal abuse against them.\nIt is the hope of this newspaper that\nthis campaign may bo conducted in a\nspirit of fairness and with a disposition\nto discuss the principles for which can ■\ndidates stand, rather than tho candidates\nthemselves. But if anything is to be\ninferred from the dirty personal flings of\nthe Clark organ in this town, it is that\nthe legislative candidates it is support\ning are desirous of a campaign of per\nsonalities. If this is tho case they can\nbe accommodated, although the Bee\nwould undertake such a disagreeable\nduty with great reluctance. If it is not\nthe case, the legislative candidates in\nquestion should lose no time in calling\noff their dog.\nTho republican outcast, tho Libbv\nNews, has sold out the republican county\nticket for support of the Clark legislative\nticket. Having sold itself to Clark, the\nNews cannot conceive of honesty in any\nother newspaper and accuses tho Bee of\ncovertly working for the republican leg\nislative nominees. The News attacks\nTom Carter, upon whose bounty it has\nexisted for the past two years, and while\ntho Bee has as little use for Carter as\ntho News, we cannot but share the con\ntempt of all decent citizens for such an\nungrateful traitor as the News has\nshown itself to be. It has sold out Car\nter and tho republican county ticket for\nClark\'s money and by its course has\nadded to tho disgrace of Libby, which\nalready had enough to hear iu being\nknown as the home of "Transom" Geiger.\nIt is a sad spectacle to see Joe Toole,\ntho once highly respected governor of\nMontana, standing upon a political plat\nform dictated by W. A. Clark, briber.\nIt is small wonder that Mr. Toole looks\ntroubled and ill at ease. Doubtless the\nfear haunts him that at any of his meet\nings someone is liable to rise and ask\nhim if he approves that part of the dem\nocratic state platform which endorses\nW. A. Clark. What could Mr. Toole say\niu such a case?\nA sample of the opposition to the In\ndependent democratic legislative nomi\nnees is the tearing down of the placards\nannouncing meetings in their interest.\nThis has been done on the east side of\nthe river and in other parts of theeounty.\nIt is a petty and mean kind of opposi\ntion but fully worthy of the cause prob\nably represented by those guilty of it.\nIt has remained for an actor, James\nNeill, to rebuke those who are ready to\nsell their souls for Clark\'s money. Clark\nwanted Neill to introduce some "vindi\ncation" jokes into his performance and\noffered him §1000 to do it. Neill scorned\nthe offer and wired Clark\'s agent that\nthere was not money enough in Montana\nto induce him to so degrade his art\nOne of tlic Remit*.\nOne of the most deplorable features in\nconnection with the attempt of W. A.\nClark to fasten his crime upon Montana\nis the number of personal animosities it\nhas engendered among the people of this\nstate. Hundreds of citizens of Montana\nremember the civil war, when brothers,\neven fathers and sons were divided over\nwhat they each believed to be a struggle\nfor t he right and the maintenance of\nprinciple! While not - for one moment\nbelieving that any principle of such pro\nportions as existed then is involved in\nthis fight, still it must he admitted that\nin many instances the results have been\nof a similar nature, although in a far\nless degree. Men who for years have\nbeen the closest of personal friends, who\nhave endured the privations and hard\nships of frontier life together, have seen\nthe seeds that they planted years ago\ngrow into a golden harvest for the pres\nent generation, are today pronounced\nenemies. And why? Simply that one\nbelieves that the crime of one man\nshould be vindicated regardless of the\nfeelings of tho people who are called\nupon to pass upon it, the other that the\nfair name of the state should be pre\nserved from further shame and disgrace.\nPossibly every newspaper in this state\ncould name many instances where these\nconditions exist; at least the Enterprise\ncould name a number of them.\nAnd when all the facts and circum\nstances are taken into consideration,\nwhat is the motive for this sundering of\nlifelong friendships? Simply that the\nambitious greed of a single man for a\npublic office may be satisfied at whatever\ncost. It matters little to W. A. Clark\nwho suffers, if he may win. It makes no\ndifference to him what other states or\nother people may think of Montana so\nlong as he may go back to the United\nStates senate and force his unwelcome\npresence upon that august body. It\nmatters little to him whether or not he\nwould be accepted on a second election,\nvalid though it might be, for if rejected\nhe would be willing to try again.\nIn view of this, how much longer are\nthe people to endure such a struggle?\nHas defeat no warnings that even the\nmost unscrupulous politician must obey?\nIs the stagnation of the social, political\nand moral sense of a state a crime that\ncalls for no end, no punishment, no\nabandonment to the fundamental princi\nples of right and honor that are supposed\nto prevail in every community? The\nonly way that this can be determined is\nfor every man who cares more for the\nwelfare of the state than ho does for tho\npersonal ambitions of Clark, to go to the\npolls on the Gth of November and vote to\nforever rid the political life of the state\nof a man who labors under the belief\nthat gold rules supreme and that no\nmanhood is so strong or unimpeachable\nthat it cannot be brought under its\nblighting influences.—Livingston Enter\nprise. _\nLOCAL MARKET REPORT.\nCorrected Mondays and Thursdays of\nEach Week.\nHAY\nTimothy,\nBran, ....\nShorts, ....\nOats, 100 lbs, -\nChop feed, per 1(K) lbs,\n$13.00\n15.00\n18.1»)\n1.25\n1.25\nFLOUR—\nBest grade, per 100 lbs,\nSecond grade, per 100 lbs,\n$ 2.40\n2.00\nWHEAT—\nLocal markot price for No. 1,\nDuluth quotations, No. 1 hard,\n" " No. 1 N.\n" " Decomber\n$ 96\n- 79)4\n77)4\nLUMBER\nCommon rough,\n12-inch common,\nSurface 1 side and edge,\nSelect, botli sides surfaced,\nFirst-class, full clear,\nSecond-class, full clear,\nShingles, (star A star)\nStandard, ....\n$ 8.50\n9.00\n10.00\n12.00\n25.00\n20.00\n- 2.50\n2.00\nBUILDING PAPER—\nBest,\nOrdinary,\nFor felt, ...\n- $ 1.50\n1.00\n2.00\nBEEF—\nWhole, sides or quartors,\nPOULTRY\nHens, ...\nSpring chickens,\nMUTTON\nWhole,\nVEAL\nSide, ...\nPORK\nSide, ...\nMISCELLANEOUS—\nPotatoes, 100 lbs,\nEggs, per doz.,\nButter, per lb., ranch\nCreamery, per lb,\nCOFFEE—\nArbuckle\'s, per lb.\nLion brand, per 3 lbs.\nSugar, per 100 lbs, (granulated)\n12)4\n25@35\n- 20\n50\n$ 7.50\nAPPLICATION FOR PARDON.\nHelena, Mont., Oct. 6,1900.\nAt a meeting of the State Board of Pardons,\nheld at its office on the above date, the follow\ning business among other things was t ransacted :\nIn the matter of the Application\')\nfor Pardon, granted by the l v\nGovernor, to one rLase No. 101a.\nA.

Everybody\nknows that the Amalgamated Copper\ncompany has no monopoly of the copper\noutput by a long shot. Clark and Heinze\nthemselves control enough of the copper\noutput of America to smash any move\nment to raise the price of copper, and if\nthere ever is a copper trust Clark and\nHeinze must necessarily be parties to it,\nand when Governor Toole or anyone else\nof ordinary or exceptional intelligence\nasserts that there is a copper trust in\nMontana he is prac\' \'ring intentional\ndeception. Mr. Toole never referred to\nClark in the course of his address. Per\nhaps his failure to score the Amalga\nmated and to praise Clark was owing to\nthe fact that the Bee had asked him\nsome questions which ho might have\nfound hard to answer in connection with\nany reference to Clark and the Amalga\nmated. Ho referred to the questions\nand said ho wouldn\'t bother with any of\nthem except the one which repeated the\nstory which has been going the rounds\nof the state press to the effect that in\n1890 he wrote a letter to J. G. Morony,\nthen secretary of the democratic state\ncommittee, stating that ho could not\ntake the stump for Bryan and silver for\nfear of giving offense to the Northern\nPacific Railway company, for whom he\nwas at that time attorney. Mr. Toole\ndenounced the story as a lie. Ho said\nhe had stumped for Bryan and silver in\nthat campaign as far as his business en\ngagements would allow; that his connec\ntion with the Northern Pacific termi\nnated soon afterwards and he did not\nknow if his efforts on behalf of Bryan\nwere the cause of the rupture with the\nrailway company or not.\nUntil the other side is heard from the\npublic is bound to accept Mr. Toole\'s\ndenial of the story. The citizens of Kal\nispell are to be congratulated upon the\nfact that although the charge embodied\nin the story has been openly made in the\nnewspapers of the state ever since Mr.\nToole was nominated, ho waited until he\nreached this city before entering a for\nmal denial.\nMr. F.

When Mr. Toolo had con\neluded the audience began to leave,\nwhen Chairman Pratt announced Mr.\nHiggins. The audience stopped and\nmany returned to their seats and there\nwere calls for Higgins. But that gentle\nman was evidently not in the humor to\nshow himself, so the people had to leave\nwithout the pleasure of hearing him.\nThe party went west on the 10:20\ntrain. _\nGovernor Toole\'s Stock Speech.\n[Concluded from First Page.]\ncious Brobdignagian, this collossal and\ndemoniacal Frankenstein monster, this\nincarnation of all the ferocities and all\nthe atrocities of all the furies and all the\ninfernal fiends of the stygian lakes of\neverlasting torment—leaping with tiger\nish bound from one end of Montana to\nthe other, and tearing to pieces with\nensanguined paw all our rights, all our\nliberties, all our institutions, all our\nwives and sons, and daughters, and men\nservants, and maidservants, and oxen\nand asses, and strangers within our gates\nagainst the peace and dignity of the\nstate of Montana and contrary to the\nstatutes in such cases made and pro\nvided. Kerosene!\n"It may be that there were men in the\nlast legislature, republicans and demo\ncrats, who were not vestal virgins—I do\nnot know. Seventy-live per cent of the\nrepublicans in that body were charged\nwith having lost the innocence of unborn\nbabes; whether justly or unjustly\ncharged I do not know. The same men\nthat bring these charges tell us that\nNero was not a man of spotless charac\nter, that Catherine de Medici instigated\nthe massacre of St. Bartholomew\'s day\nthat the Duke of Alva was a butcher,\nMarie Antoinette a strumpet, Louis XV\nrake, George IV. a scalawag, Wilkes\nBooth an assassin, William M. Tweed\nplunderer, and William A. Clark\nboodler—but whether these men and\nwomen are justly or unjustly so charged\nI do not know. They tell us that Judas\nIscariot, Benedict Arnold, Simeon\nHobson and John H. Geiger were traitors\nand betrayers, reeking with perfidy and\ndishonor, objects of everlasting obloquy\nand contempt—but I do not know. For\naught I know all these men are as pure\nand unsullied, as white and immaculate\nas any saint in heaven, and fit to sing in\nthe seraphic chorus of the most high\ncherubim around the throne through all\neternity. Kerosene\n"But it\'s not to purge the state of any\nfancied wrong, it\'s not to purify it of any\nimagined scandal and disgrace, it\'s not\nto establish a higher standard of political\nmorality; it\'s not to tell the world that\nMontana is not always for sale to the\nhighest bidder, that our enemies are at\nwork to throw us and our barrels down\nGentlemen, be not deluded. There are\nmen who are opposing me today who\nhave honored me and promoted my as\npirations, and to whom I am attached by\na friendship little short of filial affection,\nHowever, the men who oppose me and\nthe cause I represent today are political\nhighwaymen and desperadoes; they are\nthieves, liars, anarchists, cutthroats and\nassassins, an organized band of murder\nous bandits, the scum and offscourings\nof humanity, conceived of the Standard\nOil company, born of the Amalgamated\nCopper company, and thrust out into\nthe world for the sole purpose of drench\ning our goodly state of Montana and sat\nurating everything inflammable within\nit with showers of kerosene, and then to\nsubmit it all and sundry to the ravages\nof the torch. That\'s what tlioy\'re here\nfor. That\'s why they oppose us. That\'s\nthe reason they have organized this\nBoxer movement against us. Their mis\nsion is to destroy us and ours, to carry\nour severed heads, impaled on stakes\nwith ribald shout and jest throughout\nthe state, to burn and loot our peaceful\nhomes, to torture our beloved ones, to\ncry havoc and let slip the dogs of war\nfrom Hope to Glendive, from Havre to\nLima, and from hell to breakfast.
