CING BOYS OF JENA.\nOugrowth of Age of Bacchantes or\nWandering Students.\nHundreds of years ago the streets\nof Jc!;a and o her German towns used\nto o; ho to il.e sones of black-robed\nmonks, who went from door to door \'\npip viii and h ageing alms. Their ex\na-Kf|o was Tr lowed by bands of poor\ns s. k:?- .n as iiacchantes. These\nBur r lr:nt< s andered from one uni- I\nvi". -si y o ai;? ther in search of better\ninstruction or better means of sup- J\nport. Such a wandering, life was fa\nvored by the customs of times when\npeople thought it a virtue to give free\nly to all persons seeking help, but\nespecially to monks and students.\nThe f\'acchantes had with them\nyounger traveling scholars known as\nskirmishers, who were to receive in\nstruction in return for certain services.\nThe younger, skirmisher had to wait\nupon his Raechante, beg, and even\nsteal for him, and for the most part\nhe was very tyrannically used. But\nas he was a waif without other protec\ntion he had to make the best of mat\nters.\nAfter th^ reformation in many\nplaces these, orphan boys, or waifs,\nwere banded into organised choirs,\nwho received pay from chu.ihos. but j\nalso were assisted by private rub- i\nscriptions. It was their duty to sing\nnot only In the churches, but before\nthe hous\'s of their jiaJrons as welt.\nThus they \' jased to be begirars. Mar\ntin LutluT liimself as a boy ha.l been\none of the>e singers, and it was large\nly due to Ms influence that the old\ncustom of begging entirely passed\naway. The:e Is a famous picture of\nLuther as a singing b~y in Eisenach\nwhere his < ng attracted the attention\nof tho gc-.t Fran Cotta. who adopted\nand eduTi\'- 1 him.\nNowadays the old custom of the \'\nchoir boys\' singihg from house to :\nhouse is fading away. There are only\nfive other towns besides Jena in the\nwhole Ocrm.in em) Ire where this mu\nsic can he heard. Once each year the\nsinging boys go to Eisenach and sing\nbefore the emperor In the great hall\nof the historic castle of the Wartburg,\nwhere th<* Minnesingers held their\nmusic battles.\nThere are just 26 qt the Jena sing\ning boys, five each of the ages of I1.\n12, IS and 14 years.

It finds that Mexico\nh is about $700,000,000 of American cap\nital, Cuba fl85.000.000, and other\nc >un tries lesser amounts. A Rood deal\nof American money has gone to China,\nto Japan, and even into Russia, especi\nally into the mines of Siberia.\nOn the showing as made, the Spring\nfield Republican laments that our own\ncolonies, "which were so much wanted\nas an ontlet for that oversupply of\ncapital which oppresses us, seem to have\nIwen overlooked in the" enumeration\naltogether." It considers also that the\nshowing does not establish the United\nStates as a creditor nation, because\nmuch more foreign money is invested\nin the United States than the United\nStates iuvests in foreign countries. In\nthis it is quite right The United\nStates is not a creditor nation in the\ninternational sense, because we borrow\nfar more money than we lend.\nWith respect to American invest\nments in <mr colonies, however, Massa\nchusetts contemporary is quite in the\nwrong. American money was ready to\nHow into the Philippines anil has to\nsome extent gone into the Sandwich\nIslands. But our legislation forbids.\n"The Philippines for the Filipinos" is\nthe cry. American money can not go\nthere and find adequate scope for in\nvestment. Under the l>enign .and\naltruistic guidance of Senator Hoar, in\nhis time, such bars were put up as\neffectually kept American investments\nout of the Philippines. The fear was\nthat Americans would exploit those\nislands to the advdntage of capital and\nto the disadvantage of the natives.\nThat was the sentiment, and the laws\npassed in pursuance of that sentiment\ngovern today. If the Philippines were\nthrown open to Amaric.i:i exploitation\nand development precisely as oar home\nterritories were thrown open in their\ntime, as New Mexico, Arizona and\nAlaska are now open, there would not\nIh> the least trouble ab tut getting\nonorinons amounts of money to open up\nand develop the Philippine Islands.\nBut as it is, American capital can not\nK\') there to udvantuge. And as long as\nthr t legislation remains on the stauto\nixtoka, it is idle to expect American\nexploitation, and just such showings as\narc. quoted altove will continue to lie ?\n.made. ? Salt Lake Tribune.\nFinland Snmmers\nThe famous "white nights" of the\nnorth are a most surprising phenome\nnon to the visitor from southern climes.\nIt is a wierd experience declares A. M\nScott in "Through Finland," to sit for\nthe first time npon a veranda at mid\nnight and read a newspaper or walk\nhome from a restaurant at t o\'clock in\nthe morning and see people still gossip\nping at the street corners or strolling\nalong the promenades under a bright,\nclear sky.\nA spirit of rest and peace is over all\nthe earth. The sky is bright, not with\n?the flry brilliancy of noon, but with a\ntender, gentlo nidi finer. The colors of\nlandscape have become softened, but\nblended. Tb re are 110 Endows save for\na week or two in June, when the bright\nnorthern sky :>t midnight projects faint\nghost like shadows toward the south.\nThe sun just nips below the hori7. ni\nand no more. There is no division be\ntween the snns-.it and the dawn. The\nsame rosy fius i serves for both.\nSummer in i\'iuland is, in fact, otirr\nlong day. Never a star is to Iks seen,\nand when the first faint star glimmers\nin the south it ts a sign that t\'ne sum\nmer is past an 1 that the autumn fr.ists\nhave arrived.\nThe long li ;ht has a marvelous\neffect ujjon % getation, forcing its\ngrowth at hot house pace. The "white\nnights" account for the suddenness of\nthe burgeoning and for the intensity of\nthe heat. Land and water have no\ntime to cool. One cannot fail to be\nstruck wit"h thfc erroneous size of the\nfoliage upon th ; oak and hawth?rue\ntree* as compared to that with which\nwe are accustomed. Botanists have\nexplained this as being due to a larger\nsupply of light. It has sometimes b.*en\nsuggested that we can hasten the harv\nests bv the use of artificial lights. Na\nture herself does this for the Finnish\nfarmer.\nI\nGreatest- Year For Giving\nj A summary ?>f large public benefac\nj tions in the United States during lOtMl\ngives a total of $141,250,000. which is\n$10,000,000 beyond any former year and\ndouble the aggregate of 1908. A third\nof the amount was bestowed on public\neducation, which has always figured at\nthe head of the list. Some of the gifts\nare from persons who led exceedingly\nsimple and quiet lives and whose wealth\nproved to be in.ich greater than was\nsupposed. T lit- if plans to dispose of it\nwere also unknown until their wills\nwere read. Daring the last decade\n1 large benefactions in this country have\nexceeded ?WHMMit.OOO, a fact that will\nbe viewed as surprising in any other\nnation. The movement on this scale is\ndistinctly American. Something must\nIhj credited to the fact that this is the\ni wealthiest country in the world, but\ni other races are rich and not disposed to\n! give to anything like this extent. Gifts\nin the United States amounting to ten\nbillions is a con ->ervative estimate for\nthe next century.\nAlthough this country has long led\nall others in liberal provision for public\neducation the gifts this year for the\npurpose footed up nearly $50, 000.0(H).\nPublic libraries li.ive multiplied to such\nan extent that too supply has almost\novertaken the de natid. Numerous de\npartments of Si-.ence have been ex\npanded by gifts. Endowments have\nl>een given for the study of certain\ndestructive disea->-s and for the promo\ntion of the lifiil h of the ]>eople in\ngeneral, llospitais have not been o\'ver\nlooked, but many more are needed, and\non a larger basi*. Museums for art\ncollections have l>een generously\nrcmeinliered and deserve a great deal\nmore. Their utilities apply to business\nus well as the s?m-; >1 and recreative life\nof the people.
