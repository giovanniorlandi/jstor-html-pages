        <pre>['THE RONAN PIONEER.\\\nEntered as second-class matter May 12, 1910, at the post Located in the Heart of the Great Flathead Indian Reservation\noffice at Ronan, Montana, under the Act of March 3, 1879\nVolume II. No. 31. RONAN, MISSOULA COUNTY, MONTANA, DECEMBER 1, 1911. $2 Per Year\nGovernors of Western\nStates on Boosting Tour\nThe western governors are on a number of interesting subjects\na boosting tour throughout the will be discussed by laymen. The\neast. They met in St. Paul Sun- subjects and speakers are as fol\nday last and there took passage, lows:\non a special train filled with the\nproducts of their states and will\ngo as far east as Albany and as\nfar south as Washington. On\ntheir way they will be received\nand entertained at several cities.\nIt is expecdted they will be back\nin the city of St. Paul by Dec. 13.\nThe governors included in the\nparty will be A. L. Eberhart of\nMinnesota, John Shafroth of\nColorado, Joseph E. Carey of\nWyoming, R. L. Vassey of South\nDakota, John Burke of North\nDakota, James Hawley of Idaho,\nEdwin Norris of Montana, M. E.\nHay of Washington, Trasker\nOddie of Nevada and H. W.\nJohnson of California. The gov\nernors will be accompanied by\ntheir secretaries and members of\ntheir staffs. The party will be\nin charge of former Governor\nJames H. Brady of Idaho, with\nwhom the idea of the trip origin\nated, and Riley Atkinson, secre\ntary of the Chamber of Com\nmerce of Boise, Idaho.\nThe object of the tour. as con\nceived by Governor Brady, is\nmainly educational. Politics is\nto be strictly barred and for that\nreason the urgent invitation of\nthe woman\'s suffrage advocates,\nasking the governors to address\nsuffrage meetings in various cit\nies during their trip, have been\npolitely but firmly declined. The\ngovernors undertake the trip not\nonly with a view to learning\nsomething by observing the con\nditions in the east, but they hope\nto convey a valuable lesson to\nthe people of the overcrowded\neast, by bringing before them\nconvincing proofs of the enor\nmous resources and advantages\nof the west and informing them\nin regard to the manifold induce\nments offered to settlers in the\nwestern states. It is confidently\nexpected that this tour will be\nfruitful of results by giving a\nnew and powerful impetus to the\nwestward movement of immi\ngration and by diverting the\nwestward march of settlers from\nCanada to the western states of\nthe United States.\nIts Not So Funny, Either\nOne day this week some of the\nmatrons of Ronan whom it was\nsupposed were more wise, under\ntook to imitate their younger\ndays and attempted to fathom\nthe intricacies of roller skating.\nTo those who were there (as\nspectators) it is said to have been\nvery amusing. Each of them\nwere in that class who formerly\nessayed to belong to the best of\nskaters, and their efforts to\n"come back" proved their un\ndoing. Some of them, the bal\nance of this week have been, un\nable to sit down, others to stand\nup, and some when once down,\neither sitting or reclining, have\nmuch trouble in getting up, and\nthose who remain up cannot get\ndown.\nAll of them affirm their deter\nmination of trying it again, and\ntheir next endeavor will probably\ncause the doctor\'s bill to be the\nbig item in the household ex\npense for the month.\nMethodist Church Notice\nWe wish to call special atten\ntion to the services next Sunday\nevening and to extend an urgent\ninvitation to all to attend. In\nplace of the sermon by the pastor\nlows:\n"The place of a Christian citi\nzen in the affairs of today. "-D.\nN. Mason.\n"The Bible as a source of Edu\ncation."-E. E. Healey.\n"The teaching of the Gospel\nand Modern Business."-A. M.\nThornburgh.\nThese are practical subjects\nwhich deal with the immediate\nconcerns of the community. In\nconnection with this service there\nwill be music furnished by the\nchoir, consisting of chorus songs,\nsolos and instrumental selections.\nThis promises to be one of the\nmost profitable and enjoyable\nservices yet herd in the church\nand we earnestly solicit a large\nattendance. The service will be\ngin promptly at 7:30.\nIn the morning the regular\nservice will be held, consisting\nof Sunday school at 10:30 and\npreaching at 11:30. The sermon\nfor the morning will be in keep\ning with the Thanksgiving sea\nson.\n. A. D. WELCH,\nPastor.\nThe Ronan Postoffice\nPostmaster A. M. Sterling has\nimproved the Ronan postoffice\nthis week and enlarged the num\nber of call and lock boxes and\nprovided some other necessary\napparatus to care for the increas\ning business transacted therein.\nHe has just received the new\nboxes and turned the same around\nin the room used for the post\noffice and is now able to handle\nthe heavy mail received daily in\nmuch quicker time.\nThe business at Ronan has\ngrown wonderfully during the\npast year and today it requires\nthe entire time of one person,\nand the greater part of the day\ntwo are busy. The money order\nbusiness alone takes up the time\nof one person when not attend\ning to the distribution of the\nmail, the land payments being\npractically all made through this\nmedium.\nIt is probable that the Ronan\noffice will be raised soon now to\na presidential office, and this\nfact demonstrates that the re\nceipts and cancellations are suf\nficient in volume to bring the of.\nfice within the number entitled\nto be so classed. Patrons will\nappreciate the efforts of Post\nmaster Sterling in providing the\nnew equipment and in increasing\nthe service in the manner he has.\nVisited Local Schools\nMrs. Pearl T. Marshall, county\nsuperintendent of schools, has\nbeen engaged in an official visit\nto the local schools on the reser\nvation this week. Mrs. Mar\nshall arrived in Ronan Monday\nand spent the early part of the\nweek visiting the schools in the\ncountry west and northwest of\ntown and afterwards visited the\nlocal schools.\nMrs. Marshall is one of those\nwho takes great pride in the con\nduct of her office and is giving\nthe people of Missoula county her\nbest endeavor as superintendent\nof schools. The people of the res\nervation especially have every\nreason to feel that Mrs. Mar\nshall is their friend as she has\nlabored earnestly in their, behalf\nin the interest of schools in every\nsketion.\nElection Officials Named\nThe board of county commis.\nsioners received the report of S.\nNapton; appointed to take the\ncensus of Ronan, last Monday,\nand the election officials for the\nfirst election to determine the\nquestion as to whether a major\nity of the voters desired to incor\nporate the town were named.\nRoss Lemire, B. H. Denison and\nA. Sutherland were selected to\nact as judges, and A. M. Sterling\nand Coker F. Rathbone as clerks.\nD. T. Curran, chairman of the\nboard, called up over the phone\nand stated that the board was\nsurprised to find as many names\non the list as 510 and congratu\nlated the people of Ronan on the\nremarkable growth. He also\nstated that the board would have\ncalled the election at once, but\nfor the fact that the great reg\nister showed only one duly regis\ntered voter residing in Ronan\nand asked that the people here\nget busy and register this week\nand have the names forwarded\nat once. This matter has been\nattended to and the election proc\nlamation is looked for next week.\nHealthful\nCountry\n"It is a remarkable fact," said\none of the Ronan physicians yes\nterday morning, "how healthful\nthis country is. Why, do you\nknow that there is not one half\nthe sickness this yesr that there\nwas last and with twice the pop\nulation here now as then. It is\nnot only in, Ronan but through\nout the entire reservation coun\ntry, and outside physicians re\nport the same condition all over\nwestern Montana."\nThat reads good to everybody,\nexcept the doctor, and they are\nnot complaining. In a new\ncountry many people living\ntherein, having changed loca\ntions for their health, to know\nthat sickness is absolutely at a\nminimum speaks well for the\nhealthful conditions surrounding\nthem.\nDr. Fuhrer, the U. S. R. S.\nphysician, says that he probably\nhas the best opportunity of any\nof the local physicians to properly\ngauge the amount of sickness in\nthe country. He says that were\nit not for the accidents which\nhave happened to men engaged\nin the reclamation work during\nthe past three months he would\nnot have had any patients in all\nthe 300 or more now employed at\nthat work. Only three men have\nbeen in the hospital during that\ntime from the reclamation.\nIf there is any place where the\nrecord will equal the Mission val\nley for healthfulness in all the\ncountry around us, let them\nmake the fact known, otherwise\nthis section will lay claim to the\nbelt and is prepared to defend\nthe title.\nDied at St: Ignatius\nCharley Regis, one of the lay\nbrothers at St. Ignatius mission,\ndied last Friday morning, aged\n77 years. The deceased was born\nin Italy and had been in this im\nmediate vicinity for 35 years.\nHe had long been gardener at\nthe Mission and it was through\nhis skill and incessant labor that\nthe grounds and gardens at the\nMission have reached the high\nstate of cultivation as is shown\nthere. He was buried Saturday\nmorning last at 10 o\'clock, in the\nCatholic lot, Father De la Motte\npreaching the funeral sermon.\nThe Big Store now has a lumber yard\nat the rear of the store. You are in\nvited to inspect this stock and get\nestimates. --See main office.\nPermanent Exhibit\nTo exploit the resources and\naid in the development of the\nAmerican Northwest, the North\nwest Development League will\nplace a permanent exhibit of the\nproducts of the soil, lakes, rivers,\nforests and rivers of the various\nstates in a great display room\nand show them to thousands of\npeople who pass through and\nvisit the city of Saint Paul-the\ngateway to the northwest terri\ntory.\nThis state has been invited to\noccupy several hundred square\nfeet of this space without cost\nas the St. Paul Association of\nCommerce has entered into a\ncontract with the league to fur\nnish the display rooms in one of\nthe new buildings of that city\nrental free, if the league will\nfurnish, light and maintain the\ndisplay; the offer has been ac\ncepted.\nThe plan is simply to show\nevery person who transfers in\nSt. Paul as well as those who\nlive there, a comprehensive ex\nhibit of the products of the\nfollowing states: Minnesota,\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota,\nMontana, Idaho, Washington and\nOregon. The exhibit will be\nconducted without prejudice, the\nleague publishing uniform infor\nmation about each state in attrac\ntive booklets, distributing them\nand securing the names of all\nvisitors which will be furnished\nthe Commercial Clubs and state\nimmigration officials of each\nstate.\n"We ought to show from ten\nto twenty thousand people every\nmonth this exhibit-we are sure\nwe will show more than five\nthousand on the average and\nduring the tourist season as high\nas thirty thousand a month,"\nsaid Secretary Will A. Campbell.\nMore than one hundred thousand\npeople a year, many of them\nright on their way to look over\nCanada, will get our literature, a\nlot-of personal information, see\nthe exhibit, have their names\nsent to people who will follow\nthem up and become wise as to I\nwhat is possible in the American\nNorthwest.\n"It is the biggest thing which\nhas happned for a long time and t\nthe St. Paul Association of Com\nmerce shows the breadth of its\nwork for better agriculture and a\nbetter development in the north\nwest by the generous offer of\nspace in the great Commerce I\nBuilding."\nIt\nFarmers\' Meeting\nThere will be a regular and\nspecial meeting of the Flathead\nFarmers\' Mutual asssciation at\nthe Elliott school house on Sun\nday, Dec. 3rd, at 2 p. m. At\nthis time the nomination and\nelection of officers for the ensuing\nterm will be held. All members\nare requested to be present and\ncommittee chairman to bring in\ntheir committee reports.\nBEN JACOBS,\nSec\'y-Treas.\nEighteen new cardinals of the\nCatholic church were created in\nRome on the 27th inst. Among\nthe number were three from the\nUnited States, Mgr. Farley of\nNew York City; Mgr. O\'Connell\nof Boston, and Mgr. Falconio of\nWashington. It is said that the\npope feels the great impor\ntance of the event with respect\nto the relation of the church to\nAmerica, and said in private con\nversation that the flourishing\ncondition of the church in the\nUnited States would remain in\nhistory as one of the chief char\nacteristices of his pontificate.\nIndian Department Policy\nDetrimental to Progess\nLast week the Reservation\nLand & Lumber Co. decided to\nlay a pipe line from their plan\nning mill in Smead addition to\nthe creek for the purpose of\nsupplying their engine, which\nwill be used to furnish power to\ndrive the machinery, with water.\nPreparations were being made to\ngo ahead with the work when\nbehold, they discovered that\nUncle Sam would not allow the\nlaying of the pipe line along\nthe street leading to the creek.\nAll the company could under the\ncircumstances was to quit work.\nIt is becoming quite the thing\nnowadays to plan some develop\nment of the many resources of\nthis reservation only to run up\nagainst a departmental order\nwhich prevents the work being\ndone. One can hardly breathe\nthe pare air of the country with\nout first obtaining a blue print\nof the section of country he de\nsires -to breath in and have it\n0. K\'d. by some Indian depart\nment official at Washington be\nfore really doing so. As to any\nreal work being done which\nwould in any manner effect the\nreservation, that is out of the\nquestion.\nIn this connection it has come\nto light within the past week that\nno more Indian land leases are to\nbe made. That is, no lease will\nbe made of lands that belong to\nany able bodied Indian, for the\nreason that the department has\ndecreed that the Indian shall\nwork his land himself. Shades\nof Tecumseh! but that depart\nment head has a wonderful knowl\nedge of conditions as they really\nare on an Indian reservation. It\nhas also been learned that no\nmore patents are to be issued for\nthe reason-it is claimed-that\nthe Indian sells his land as soon\nas a patent has been issued. It\nwould.not be surprising were the\ndepartment to refuse to issue a\nhomesteader a patent unless he\ngive a bond not to sell his land.\nThere would be just about as\nmuch justice in one order as in 4\nthe other.\nCongress passed a law author\nizing the Indian allottee to sell 60\nacres of his 80.. Some big bureau\nchief at Washington issues an or\nder that beats the law congress\npassed seven different ways. He\nsays that no one will be allowed\nto sell until the land is covered\nwith an irrigation ditch, as it will\nbe worth much more at that time.\nThat may be true and it may not.\nToday men can be found who are\nwilling to gamble a little and buy\nthe land believing that the water\ncharges will not exceed $80 per\nacre, and are paying-or would\npay-a price which when added\nto the $30 water charge, makes\nthe land bring about all or a little\nmore than it is really worth. Sup\npose the water charge is in ex\ncesss of $30 per acre, would it\nthen be reasonable to expect the\nland to bring as much or more\nthan it will at the present? The\naction of the department will un\ndoubtedly retard development;\nthat is about all that can be ex\npected from the present policy.\nAgain, the department in time\npast gave the agent at Jocko, as\nwell as all other agents, some lat\nitude with the Indian funds to be\nused in emergency cases for the\nrelief of Indians in distress. This\nprivilege was not abused and in\nmany cases the agent was able to\nprovide provisions and relief for\naged and infirm Indians. Today\na new order of thing prevails and\nto use money for this purpose\npermission must first be obtained\nfrom the department at Washing.\nton. Before the red tape attach\ned to such matters can be unrav\neled and untangled death may\novertake the unfortunate ward of\nthe overzealous bureau chief and\nthe funds "conserved" for future\ngenerations of the fast disappear\ning race. This plan of caring for\nthe Indian is working so well that\nhe is often in the keeping of a\nhigher power than a Washington\nofficial before assistance can be\ngiven.\nTo those who have had experi\nence on other reservations it\nseems just a little pin-headed to\nput such policies in operation. It\nappears that it would be bettei\nEor all concerned that the In\nhian lands be leased and a reve\nnue derived upon which the own.\n3r may live without want. To\nrefuse to allow the Indian to eith\nar lease or sell his land places\nnany of them in an exceedingly\nlifficult condition. They have not\nhe means to purchase horses and\nnachinery with which to farm,\nLnd the department warns all\nnerchants and others not to trust\nhem for such things; then how\nire they to farm on their own\nlook, even were they so inclined?\nCo many of them it mean hard\nihips and privation, if not desti\ntution and starvation in the face\n>f plenty. Rich in lands, they\nnust endure it all to satisfy the\nvhim of the official representative\nf the Indian Rights Association.\nTo the reservation country this\nolicy means a period of stagna\nion to business and a stop to de\n\'elopment not in keeping with\nis great possibilities, and calls\nor a vigorous protest.\nThanksgiving Guests\nMr. and Mrs. C. T. Welch had\nat dinner yesterday as Thanks\ngiving guests, Mrs. John Kint\nner, Mr. and Mrs. H. E. Stans\nbury and son King, Miss Kate\nTitus and Dr. Putney.\nMr. and Mrs. A. L.

It will\nbe used as a general storage place and\nfield plant for the extensive harbor and\nriver work being done by the govern\nment in the vicinity of New York.\nIt was bought from William t. Pe\nters, a merchant and bank director of\nNew York, who has owned it for about\ntwenty years.\nIt was nearly 100 years ago that the r\ngovernment held nominal possession of\nthe island. At the outbreak of the\nwar of 1812 a small blockhouse was E\nerected there. Directly opposite, at ]\nHallett\'s point, on the Astoria shore, a\nfortification was thrown up and\' dig\nnified by the name of Fort Stevens,\nwhile a little to the southeast on high t\nground a tower was erected called I\nCastle Bogardus. These fortifenations 1\nwere intended to defend the approach ]\nto the city from the sound, but there\nwas never any occasion to use them.\nPart of the old blockhouse was re\nmoved in time, and the remainder fell I\nto pieces. Soon after a fisherman\nsquatter, Alexander Gibson, popularly\nknown to the residents on the shore as\n- Captain "Sandy" Gibson, put up a\nI wooden shack on the island. He\ncaught his fish off the reefs, and up\nto half a century ago he was a familiar\n1 character in the locality.\n- The old fisherman lived there un\nmolested for so long a time that he\nbetablished a squatter\'s right to the\ne island and his proprietorship was vir\na tually admitted by the hotel man,\nCharles Leland, who bought the rocky\nisland from Gibson in 1803 for $300.\n1 This was the first deed of conveyance\ny in the island ever recorded, and to\nstrengthen his title Alexander Gibson\nhad the statement inserted in the deed\ns that he had held undisputed posses\nf sion for upward of fifty years.\nMr. Leland was too busy managing\nhotels to improve his island. He\nd named It Leland Island, and as such it\nwas known for many years. When\nMr. Leland went into bankruptcy it\nwas sold by his assignee to Cecil\nCampbell Higgins, a prominent New\nt York lawyer, for $2,500.\nThe ownership up to this time only\nincluded the single acre above water.\nAt low tide there is a smaller Island\na few yards to the south, and this had\nbeen called Little Mill Rock. Mr.\nHiggins endeavored to establish his\nd rights to the land under water, but\ni- about this time the government squat\n. ted on the land and used it in connec\ntion with the second explosion in Hell\ng Gate of 1885, when a large reef be\ne yond Hallett\'s Point reef was blown\ni up, the. big Hallett\'s point explosion\nhaving taken place in 1870.\nii Mr. Higgins did not establish his\ne rights to the land under water, al\nLt though in his deed to Mr. Peters about\ntwenty years ago he assigned his\nd rights to somewhat over eight acres\nr- below high water mark. Mr. Higgins\na sold it for $6,000, showing a steady\nrise in its value from the $300 paid\nL. to "Sandy" Gibson In 1803.

Terrell, having taken the\nposition that his term as United States\nsenator from Georgia expired with the\nelection of his successor, Governor\nHoke Smith, settled it by tendering his\nresignation direct to the United States\nsenate, where it was accepted and his\nname expunged from the senate roll,\nand now there remains the question\nwhen Governor Snith proposes to\nleave the exelutive anoice to represent\nthe state at Wasllington.\nHis political enemies are spreading\nstories of the danger of the loss of\nImportant popular oLi nisurnec now pend\ning in the United Stater senate\nthrough the a Isence of one Democratic\nvote; his political friends declare that\nit is his foremost duly to renain gov\nernor until he scen5e0- the ennetment\nby the general assembly of the reform\nmeasures for which he contended in\nhis campaign.\nGovernor Smith\'s ambition has al\nWays been to go to the United Stales\nSenate. When Renatoe A. S. Clay died\nlast full Smith ladt already been elect\ned governor, although he had not yet\nbeen inaugurated. Governor IBrown\nappointed his political adviser, Joseph\nAM. Terrell, to serve until I he next gen\neral assembly.\nAs the time for the meeting of the\ngeneral assembly drew on the name of\nEOKE SMITR.\nSmith came promineutly upon the\nscreen, and lie was elected on the first\nballot. There inmediately arose the\nquestion as to what Governor Smith\nwould do. This he as promptly settled |\nby a statement that he would remain\ngovernor until December, pushing\nthrough the present legislative session\nthe remainder of the reform measures\nwhich he -had advocated. In the mean\ntime, lie said, Senator Terrell could\ncontinue to serve the state, as his com\nmission would hold unti! his successor\nshould go to Washington and present\nhis credentials. He had calculated that\nSenator Terrell would be glad to con\ntinue his term of service until Decem\nber and would not want to take the\nresponsibility of leaviig the state un\nrepresented by a junior senator at this\ntime.\nBut there his political calculations\nfailed. Terrell resigned. Smith still\nrefused to go to Washington.\nMeantime Georgia is represented by\none United States senator, A. 0.

As yet no local bank\nIt has acknowledged the receipt of such\nY a deposit. The police superintendent\ni believes the money was deposited by\nn a wealthy merchant named William\nFrank, who died nearly a century ago.\ne The search for the fortune was start\n\' ed some days ago. when Mrs. Mary\ne Durham of Windfall, Ind., wrote the\nr local authorities about the money.\nis She asserts she is the sole heir of\n\'s Mr. Frank.\nýs According to her story the money\n1, was deposited by William Frank, who\na had intended it as a wedding present\n0 for his daughteta Sarah Frank. The\nwishes of the young woman ran con\ntrary to those of her father. On her\ng wedding eve she ran away with Ben\nJamin Berry, allowing the bridegroom\nselected by her father to wait vainly\nat the altar. Shortly after this Wil\n11am Frank died without having made\na will. His daughter, thinking she\nhad been disinherited by her father,\nmade no attempt to settle the estate,\nand the money remained in the bank.\nMr. Taylor declares that his detec\ntives have been working on the case\nfor sonic days and he thinks from the\ninformation gained by them that Mrs.\nDurham\'s story is true. He believes\nt that he will find the financial institu\ntion in which the money is on deposit.\nNEW TABLE DELICACY.\na Pennsylvania Parmer Enjoys a Diet of\nf Plies\' Eggs.\nInstead of following the new fad\nof swatting flies. Flaubert Marcy, a\nfarmer of Tidioute Township, Pa., is\nswarming them in coops and raising\nthem for their eggs, for which he ex\npects to find a large sale as a luxury\nin food. The eggs contain a high\npercentage of oil and albumen. He\nserves them at his own table in threo\nforms-as toasties, as flour cakes and\nin the form of cornstarch pudding\nand says he finds them both palatable\nand nutritious.\nThe coops are of woven wire and\ncover a space fifty feet by forty and\nare ten feet high. In the centre of\neach coop is a tank of water into\nwhich the little workers drop their\neggs, which the farmer gathers up\nonce a day. There are thousands of\nthem in every setting.\nWhen dried the eggs have a sort of\nhull, which may easily be removed\nby friction, leaving a product that\nlooks like rice. It may be served in\nthat form or ground into flour and\nbaked.\nThe files are of the Ephyda species\nand are found along the alkaline\nlakes in the west and in Mexico.\nTEACH HYGIENE IN CHINA.\nRich Americans Subscribe to Fund.\nTaft Enthusiastic.\nThat a group of I-a-vnrd college phy\nsicians will take the Initiative in es\ntablishing the lirst great school which\nshall attempt to drag China out of the\nuntold misery in which she now lies\nis now certain.

I guess be\'s the one you\nsaw."\nThings happen sulddenly out in the\ncountry the same as In the city. Two\ndays after seeing the young man Miss\nNettle woke up with the toothache.\nShe\' had hardly come downstairs\nand told of it when the rural mail\ncarrier left a letter for the aunt. which\nstated that a sister living ten miles\naway was ill and wanted her to drive\nover at once. She couldn\'t drive, and\nso Uncle Joe must go along: There\nwas room for Nettle to go along, but\nthe toothache kept getting worse. It\ndidn\'t take her long to decide to stay\nhome and doctor it. She could put on\na bag of hot ashes, hold hot vinegar\nin her Mouth and now and then press\na wad of cotton bntting wet with pep\npermint essence against the offending\nmolar, and there was hope that she\nwould be all right before night came.\nDuring the long day, if the ache per.\nmitted, she could swing in her ham\nmock, climb the cherry tree after the\nripe fruit, hunt for hens\' eggs in the\nbarn and watch the ducks and goslings\nin the horse pond.\n"There Is only two things to look out\nfor," said the aunt when she was\nregdy to drive away. "Keep your\neyes out fqr hawiks and tramps. As\nwe haven\'t seen a tramp for six weeks\nI guess you won\'t be bothered, but\nthem hawks are liable to drop down\nany time, If one. qomes you be sure\nto .shoot it... l\'7e heard that shooting\n\'a gun bas. been known to cure the\nI innthmehm."\ntootnacne.\nUncle and aunt had been gone an\nhour when the toothache ceased, and\nMiss Nettle piled into her hammock\nunder the pear tree with a book. She\nwas just opposite the kitchen door\nand only thirty feet away, and just\ninside the door stood the shotgun. The\nmaid had great confidence that If\nhawk or tramp came along she would\nplay the part of a heroine.\nAt 11 o\'clock, when the young man\nwho boarded down at the Stevensea\ncame past the house with his kodak.\nhe was atisded from the swinging of\nthe hammock that Miss Nettle was\nreading.\nTwo hours later, when he had snap\nshotted an old lop horned cow, a crab\napple tree and a brook that seemed to\nbe flowing up hill, be returned to and\nthe hammock so still that there was\nno doubt In his mind that the occn*\npant was asleep. He had not passed\nthe house. walklinas slowly as pos\nsible, when be caught sight of balf the\nbody of a man to an open wltdow on\nthe other side. Whoever It was had\ncome sneaking down through the earn.\nGeld.\nIt was up to the young man to lnves\ntigate. He started out with the Im.\npresilon that the Intruder was a trump.\nand be picked up a club, scaled the\npicket fence and gave a shout. The\nman In the window heard and drew\nback. He saw and dropped to the\nground and ran around the corner of\nthe house. He ran into the hammock\nand Its sleeping occupant and fell over\nthem and bounced mid sleeping occu*\npant out on the grass.\nAt the same moment the young man\nbon the Itevenses, who bad started to\npursre the* fuIISwi, caught its foot\nand took a roll, and be was go slow In\n.piolsl 01, oaltet bushes out of bil\noue haW\'~wbss b d4d getap \'tbst 1w\nturned t. eatrner just as the bewthl\ndared Nettle had dashed into the kitch\nen. seised the gun and was ready for\nhawks.\nShe had been rudely awakened.\nmore rudely dumped oi \'tbU grass and\nstepped on, and In her halt awake\nstate abe didn\'t know a hawk fromt a\nman until It was too late.\nIn a cool moment she never could\nhave mastered the mechanism of that\nold shotgun. Under the momentary\nexcitement she not only fired It. but\nsent a liberal quantity of bird shot into\nsome one\'s legs.\nShe had only heard the report of the\ngun when she became panic stricken\nand fled into the kitchen and shut and\nbelted the door, and for the next three\nor four minutes she was in a balt\nfaint. Then she realized that she had\nshot a man. She remembered that he\nhad cried out: she remembered that be\nhad fallen on the grass. She wasn\'t\novercome with horror at the thought.\nOn the contrary. she had shot a tramp\nand was entitled to all praise.\nPresently, as Miss Nettle listened\nwith her ears against the door, she\nheard groans. That meant she had\nonly wounded the tramp. Her heart\nwas touched by those groans, She\ncould not see the man after she had\nopened the door an inch or two. be\ncause he was just around the corner\nof the house, but she called out to him:\n"Are you going away before I shoot\nagain?"\n"1-i can\'t say," was the reply. "I\'m\nafraid I can\'t walk without help."\n"Why not?"\n"Because you have shot me in the\nlegs."\n"But my aunt told me to look out\nfor hawks and tramps."\n"But I am neither.one nor the other."\nJudging from his voice, he was a\ngentleman Instead, and after drawing\na long breath and breathing a prayer\nthe girl stepped outand peered around\nthe corner of the house. That young\nman from the Stevenses was lying on\nhis elbow on the grass. His face was\nvery pale, and there were blood spots\non the legs of his trousers. At sight\nof her be smiled faintly and said:\n"My name is Arthur Welbourne. I\nam stopping with my relatives, the\nStevenses. I lIve in the city and am\nan artist. If you will pardon me I\nwill say that I have heard you are\nMiss Ward. In passing the house while\nyou slept In the hammock I saw, a\ntramp climbing Into a window. I gave\nthe alarm, and he escaped. He it was.\nwho tumbled over your hammock and\nawoke you."\n"And I thought you were a-a hawk\nor a tramp and shot you!" gasped the\ngirl as she wrung her hands.\n"But fortunately without serious re\nsuits. All the shot struck my legs, but\nI may need assistance to get down\nhome."\n"But I shan\'t let you get down\nbotne. Here, take my hand and see if\nyou can stand on your feet. Now hang\non to n)y arn and let me get you into\nthe house and on to the lounge. How\ncould I have been such a silly girl?\nNow, then, you lie down here, and I\'ll\nrun for Dr. James. I know be lives in\nthe first house above here. I\'ll bring\nhim right back with me."\nShe was gone before Mr. Welbourne\ncould protest and was back to half an\nhour with the good natured country\ndoctor. It took about nn hour to pick\nout the score of bird shot that had\nbeen fired into the young man\'s legs.\nand during this time Miss Nettle walk*\ned up and down in the back yard withi\ntears in her eyes and no care if the\nhawks came down and took every hen\non the place.\nThe doctor assured her that Mr. Wel.\nbourne would live. Mr. Welbourne\nhimself assured her that he was bound\nto live to make her further acquaint\nance, and he was taken down to the\nStevepses in the doctor\'s buggy. He\nlimped for three or four days, during\nwhich time Miss Nettle and her aunt\ncalled twice, and then he ceased limp.\nlag and returned the calls.\nInside of a week he was something\nmore than a caller. It beats all bow\nfast a girl who shoots a man and the\nman who is shot by her can get ac*\nquainted-very well acquainted.

It Is the very\nlatest method of applying coatings of\ncement, lime and gypsum and other\nplastic materials to structures in need\nof repair and of putting up the orig.\ninal walls of such structures entire if\nneed be. In other words, the cement\ncoated or concrete house of the future\nseems destined to be literally "shot"\nfrom a gun. The idea of shooting a\nhouse, not to pieces, but together, may\nsound absurd, but it is well to remem\nber that this Is an age Hof scientific\nmiracles, which come almost as fast\nand as thick as the flowers that aping\nup after an April shower, and we really\nshould not be surprised at anything\nthat happens.-Teobtlcal World Magae\nsine.\nPermanent Photographs.\nLqbOyer, In France, trying to solve\nthe problem of bow to make photo\'\ngraphs permanent and free from all\nehange, has resorted to the plan of\n"Aring" them In a furnace upon en*\nmamled stone.
