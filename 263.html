The finding of the re\nmains of Mrs. Jones will be a\nsource of great relief to the be\nreaved husband and other relatives\nwho have been under a severe ten\nslon for weeks past, and is a source\nof satisfaction to Virginia & Gold\nHill Water company officials who\nhave been untiring in aiding the\nsearch for the bodies of the two\nunfortunate women ever since the\nnight of the accident.\nSIX MONTHS TO VISIT\nEVERY CAPITA!,\nThomas Wheeler arrived in this\ncity Tuesday evening on his trln\nto every capital in the Union to\nwin a wager.

Glen Andrus\nin Sunset Magazine for May, "who\nwith a working capital of $1000,\ngave the ranch kings of Northern\nCalifornia and the capitalists of the\neast the economic lesson of their\nlives. With his $1000 savings Burt\nmade his first payment on his little\nfarm, built his house and barn\nwith his own hands, and began to\nfarm It as farming should be done.\nWith only seven acres of land for\ncultivation, Burt sowed three acres\nof alfalfa, and around the home he\nplanted a small orchard; between\nthe trees he planted berries and\nvegetables; under every tree he\nplaced a bee-hive, so that the bees\nmight pollenize his trees while stor\ning for him their golden honey. He\n"kept on. planting and sowing things\nuntil every foot of land was made\nto do double and treble service.\nStill he had land left sufficient to\ndevote to a chicken yard, a pig\nstye and a cow pen. In the year\n1910 Burt took from his seven\nacres a total of $2003, and with\nhis aggregate savings he purchased\nforty acres more or river bottom\nland.\nThe story of Mr. Burt\'s little\nranch appeared In the Cultivator\nlast October, when It was described\nas the winner of the Sacramento\nValley Irrigation company\'s prize for\nthe best cared for and most typical\nproductive ranch in the holdings of\nthat great corporation.\nTHE TOKOPAH\nLABOR TROUBLES\nMAY BEJETTLED\nRKIHRT THAT .MI.VKR.S HAVE\nAGREED TO XEW CHANGE\nROOM JtriJO.\nA report reached Winneniucca on\nTuesday that the National miners\'\nunion, by a vote of 26\' to 24, had\nagreed that its members should com\nply with the new change-room rule\nof the National Mines company. The\nnew rule was put in force when\nthe present management took charge\nof the property on the first of last\nmonth. Under the new regulation\nall miners working for the com\npany were required to strip to the\nskin and change clothing both in\ngoing on and off shift. On the\nquestion of complying with the new\nrule there was a decided difference\nof opinion among the miners, there\nbeing a strong faction of the min\ners\' union members which was op\nposed to the company\'s new rule\nand advocated its rejection by the\nunion. This is the question which,\nit is understood, was submitted to\na vote of the union members and\nthey have decided to obey the rule.\nWhen the new rule was made the\ncompany agreed to pay a bonus, of\n50 cents per day to each miner\nwho would comply with it.\nThere have been rumors- that se\nrious trouble was looked for at\nNational as the outcome of the\ncompany\'s new change-room regula\ntion, but if the report of the union\'s\naction is correct, it is probable that\nwiser counsels have prevailed and\nan amicable adjustment of the dif\nferences has been reached.\nBRITISH VETO\nBILL HAS NOW -ADVANCED\nSOME\nPASSES COMMITTEE STAGE IX\nHOUSE OF COMMON\'S WITH\nOUT AMENDMENT.\nLONDON, May 5.

The newer, re\nvised editions have fallen far short of the ob\njects for which they were written, and n--whcre\nhave they supplanted the old.\nIt is not at all necessary that the Ilihle\nhe victimized by the craze for something new.\nThose who can appreciate the simple, forceful\nand exalted diction of the King James ver\nsion will hope that every future attempt to\nchange or adapt its style to popular speech\nwill be defeated.\nOne of the most notable periods in the de\nvelopment of English literature was the Hliza\nbelhan era, and of that time the King James\nBible is one of the most splendid productions\nToday this version is the greatest monument\nof the English language, pure and undefiled\nIt is perhaps also the greatest classic of the\nlanguage.\nNone of us would consider seriously a pro\nposal to rewrite Bunyan\'s "Pilgrim\'s Progress,"\nMilton\'s "Paradise Lost." or the dramas of\nShakespeare to make them conform to the\nchanges which have taken place in the language\nsince they were completed. Neither would we\nthink of setting our sacred and patriotic -songs\nto ragtime.\nThe King James version, we believe, will\nendure as long as the English language and al\nways remain one of its sturdiest pillars.\nGOVERNOR WILSON\'S TOUR.\nGovernor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey\nis about to undertake a tour to the west coast.\nHe has been very active in visiting the various\nparts of the country, the South and the old\nWest, since he was elected governor of New\nJersey last fall. Now he is going to the coast;\nand whenever he goes he makes speeches, the\neffect of which, whether that is the design or\nnot, is to cause people to talk about him as a\ngreat and successful statesman, and as a prob\nable candidate for president next year. Un\ndoubtedly the program of travel and speech\nmaking tends to the one cud of bringing him\nto the front as the democratic, presidential\nnominee.\nGovernor Wilson will on this tour speak\nlirst at Kansas City at a banquet of the fa\nmous Knife and Fork club in that city. His\nnext stop will be in Denver, where he will\nbe from May 7th to May 10th, making speeches\nbefore various bodies, one of the functions being\na reunion of the Kooky Mountain Princeton\nclub. On May 10th he will leave Denver for\nLos Angeles, the itinerary calling for his ar\nrival in Los Angeles on May 12th, for a two\ntlays\' series of speeches, reunions and recep\ntions. No doubt Governor "Wilson, in going\nfrom Denver to Los Angeles, will pass through\nSalt Lake City; in fact, he must do so in order\nto make the time scheduled.\nFrom Los Angeles Governor "Wilson will go\nto San Francisco, thence to Portland and Seattle,\nreturning east by the northern route. It will\nbe a noteworthy "swing around the circle."\nEverybody will be anxious to hear Governor\nWilson, and the citizens of those places where\nhis itinerary allows him to speak will be in\nluck.\nBLIND ART CRITIC.\nKansas City boasts of probably the only\nblind art critic in the world. He recently put\nin his appearance in the AVestern Gallery of\nArt in that city, secured the services of an at\ntendant to lend him around and immediately\nproceeded to criticize "by hand" a statute of\nDavid with the head of Goliath at the base.\nThe blind man strenuously objected to the part\nof the whiskers on the head of Goliath and, ac\ncording to critics with eyesight, his criticism\nwas correct. Several other works of art in\nthe museum also came in for a scoring at the\nhands of the blind critic and in each instance it\nwas agreed that bis opinion was correct. Now\nthe question arises, how soon will it be before\na blind man is telling the artists just how they\nshould paint pictures!\nAnd in the course of time all the "innocent\nbystanders" along the border and their families\nwill he struggling to get on the pension roll.\nA STEP IN ADVANCE.\nProvided the plan of advertising Tonopah\nthat is at present being discussed is eventually\nto become a reality, it will be one of the best\nonward steps that has ever been in this town.\nIt is proposed to issue 100,000 folders of this\nsection; showing Tonopah as the "hub" with\nthe spokes leading to the nearby towns, mines\nand the agricultural section below Tonopah,\nwhich is rapidly being developed. These fold\ners, should they be printed, will be scattered\nbroadcast throughout the entire country. They\nwill, besides showing the diagram of the sur\nrounding territory, contain a detailed account\nof the many advantages of this section. They\nwill tell of the past and of the future pros\npects of the district.\nThis is one of the finest moves that has ever\nbeen started in this section. The mine man.\nagers arc a unit in favoring the project, while\nit is reported that every business man, thus far\ninterviewed, is strongly in favor of the plan.\nProvided it is put through it will brand the\nTonopah merchant as a new man. It will dem\nonstrate his awakening.\nBRITISH VETO LAW.\nFrom all indications the power of the house\nof lords, the higher house in England, is in a\nfair way to curtailment. The parliamentary\nbill, known as the "veto bill," has now passed\nthe committee change without the least alter\nation. It is now more than likely that the bill\nwill be passed almost unanimously when it\ncomes before the lower house for action. "With\nthe adoption of this measure Merrie England\nwill be placing herself in the ranks of the fore\nmost governments of tbe world. At the present\ntime the house of commons is probably the\nmost representative body of legislatures in the\nworld. But it has ever been hampered by the\npower of the periditary lords,, who hold offic?\nthrough the accident of birth. With their power\nminimized it will be possible for the represen\ntatives of the people to accomplish much that\nis desirable for the country. And it is possi\nble that this move is simply a step towards tli.\nabolition of the higher house.\nCLEAN THE CITY\'S STREETS.\nGoldfield is setting an example that it would\nbe worth while for Tonopah to follow. Every\nhouseholder or tenant is cleaning up his prem\nises and dumping the refuse into the alley.\nThe garbage man is carting away the debris,\nand within a very short time the town will\ntake on a cleanliness that is greatly to be\ndesired. As a suggestion it might be well to\ndivide Tonopah into districts and clean up one\nat a time. It would not take very much time\nfor the residents to clean up their premises\nand the garbage man. provided he had segre\ngated districts in which to work, could shortly\ndispose of the refuse. It is up to the residents\nof this town to get busy and "do it now"\nor else we will be outdistanced by our Gold\nfield neighbors. The county commissions au\nthorized this work to be done.\nWASHOE\'S 50TH ANIIVERSARY.\n"Washoe\'s 50th anniversary" is the name\nthat has been decided upon in the northern\ncity for the great Fourth of July celebration\nwhich is at the present time being arranged.\nA mammoth parade and Mardi Gras festival\nwill be included in the day\'s events. Not to\nmention the fait that an aviation meet will also\nbe held. Keno can do things when she makes\nup her mind to, as an example might be point\ned out the divorce law enacted hv the last\nsession of the legislature. Should she show the\nsame amount of persistency in her anniversary\nevent as she did in securing the "easy divorce\nlegislation" the celebration will surelv prove\na winner.\nACTRESS AND KISSING.\nFrom New York comes the information that\nan actress has submitted -to a judge the ques\n1",?, whether or n,t it is proper that she\nshould be compelled to rehearse in kissing, under\npenalty of being discharged. The youn" ac\ntress she is but sixteen states that she is\nperfectly willing to kiss during regular perform\nances but. objects to the rehearsal business Of\ncourse the judge will undoubtedly he able to\ngive a learned decision in the master, but the\nquestion rises, since when didjinactress need\nto rehearse in kissing?\nThe retirement of Lloyd C. Griseom as chair\nman of the republican county committee in\nNew York paves the way for a restoration of\nharmony m the republican party there. Gris\neom was an ardent supporter of Colonel Theo\n(lore Koosevelt in the fight for the temporary\nchairmanship of the last state convention And\nantagonized many important republican leaders\nIf a new chairman is chosen who has not been\nidentified with factional issues, the New York\nrepublicans will be able again to present a\nunited fornt.\nCanton has always been a hotbed of revolt\nso it is not strange to hear of a revolutionary\noutbreak in that city of Southern China, which\nmay reach alarming proportions. The weak\nness of China in dealing with such a revolt\nis the weakness of Mexico in suppressing the\npresent insurrection. Discontent is too wide\nspread and the government of the province\ncan not spare enough troops to snuff out the\nrevolt at the start.\nThe big Tarmalee Transfer company in Chi\ncago, which handles all the train and hotel\nbusiness in that city, has decided to substitute\nautos for its cabs and oarrieges. although its\nbus service will be retained. This radical\nchange shows the popularity of the automobile\nand its enormous advantages when speed is\nrequired.\nNOTICE F. & A.
