With, winter coming on and a long line of, communications to protect, the Ger, man?Austrian armies in that quarter, may have no easy work to maintain, their foothold until spring. In France j, and Belgium the German forces are j, unable to make any substantial pro- j, gress and are losing large numbers j, of men in the hopeless effort to advance,, or in the desperate attempt to, hold the French and British at bay., In the Balkans they are sweeping on,, but at the tremendous sacrifice of life j, and even if they crush Serbia and j, reach Constantinople, they are butj, at the beginning: of a gigantic task, j\', Meanwhile the constant drain of j, men to keep the Teutonic armies up, to the requisite strength, and the, drain on the food supplies at home J, to feed the armies in the field must j, . tend to exhaust even so scientific I, and resourceful a nation as Germany., Recently German regulations restricting, the use of meat were Issued,, showing a shortage of this important, ifrticle of diet; and private letters, from Germany reveal even more plain i\', ly the fact that the people of that, country are beginning to suffer, from, privations of many kinds., Germany has been gaining great, victories in. Poland. Russia and the i\', Balkans, but evidently at the cost of, great sacrifices at home. A military, chain, like every other chain, is 110 \', stronger than its weakest link. The |, weak link seems to be in the conditions, among the poorer classes m, Germany, the people who really constitute, the German nation. These, conditions are the unseen forces back, of the battle fields that are working, against German success. There is, distress in France and England, loo,, but the difference is their ports are, tr> tVi*. wnrlrl and thev still have, money to purchase what they need., Wc trust with all our hearts Ibat, ihe German people will not suffer, from cold and hunger this winter, hut, wc fear from these accounts that, many of them will. From a military, . point of view however, it is impossible, to discount the importance o!, ttiis situation. If an army cannot, fight on an empty stomach, neither1, can a nation, and rn\'.css Germany j, can restock her larder, her triumphin, Russia and the Balkans will not, ! avail her. .She will eventually have, to surrender to Gencial Exhaustion,, ;::tj not to General Kitchener. This, has been the British plan of campaign, from the beginning, and there seems, f a chance that it may win., I INFLUENCE \', OF EDITORIALS., The Roanoke Times recently commented, on the alleged conditions existing, in North Carolina journalism, where a discussion has been in progress, as to why. so few people read, newspaper editorials. The Roanoke, p;?oer implies that the fault may not, be always with the readers..intimating, that, many of the newspapers do not, I, make their editorial columns readable, M and timely in comment cr. currents, 1 events and conditions. The Danville, I Register in referring in this discus}, sion says it is not prep trod to say, what the fact is. bid believes that, many of the newspapers make a mistake, in devoting too much space to, the discussion of national affairs and, politics and too little to the thoughtful, and timely consideration of local,, affairs and topics of interest to the, masses of the average ccmnum\'ly., Long dissertations on the ritf\', and on national questions an-l foreign !, topics are so much space wasted, says \', J:\' , Al, the Register since the newspapers\', published in the smaller towns can, hope to exert little influence in the, national field.", r0 r, GERMANY\'S FOOD PROBLEM, # . w-> ^ |, J ., (Richmond Virginian) |, If the cable dispatches are .to be, believed, the Germans are facing a, real crisis in the matter of food supply,, and if this be true, it is a situation, that probably points to an early,, cessation of the warfare that has dis- j, tressed the whole globe for more than |, a year., Although it may not be true mat, Germany is starving, if the ancient, axiom is true that the way to man\'s, heart is through his stomach, it is, also true that hunger will take the, belligerent spirit out of the best of, them, and the fact that the continued, warfare has touched the pocketbooks, of the Germans so heavily?to the j, extent, in fact, of drawing on the!, Emperor\'s exchequer?ise sufficient to j, make the German government sit up |, and take notice, if thesituation does i, not discourage further aggressiveness j, The German press, we are told, is j, full of the seriousness of the food I, J, situation. Says the Frankfurther |, Zeitur.g: "While our troops are fight-j, ing like the heroes of the classical I, ages, want is growing acute at home." j, j.,.. , _ ?:i |, mat striKcs trie Keynute vi uie ait- j, uation. and that sort of a situation, strikes home. It is about time that ,, the hostilities ceased; the world is, sincerely tired of it as a news fea- i, ture; Christianity demands it from i, a humanitarian standpoint, not along i, from the tremendous loss of human j, life, but also lest other nations be- i j, j, come embroiled in it. If Germany :, comes to its senses and seeks peace i, with honor, there would be an early j *, end to it, and it is to be hoped that |, the present crisis will lead Germany, to see the light. ii, In the meantime the heart of f, America is as sensibly touched by the j1, sufferings, present and to come, of j!, the German victims of this cruel war,; \', the old, the fatherless the babes in jf, arms, the women whose husbands and !c, sons have gone, never to return, as it i, has been by the sufferings of the In- i \', nocents of the other nations. They i 1, are the victims of the greed and am- 1 :, bition of their rulers.
