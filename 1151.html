M.\nL. Lockwood the declaration and\ncall for the meeting of the National\nAnti-Trust Conference. The call is\nsigned and approved by a long list of\nprominent, strong and honorable\nmen from every part of the country.\nThe declaration is, in part, as fol\nlows:\n"We believe tho eriminal con\nspiracies in restraint of trade com\nmonly known as Trnsts, which so\nalarmingly characterize the present\ntimes, are a menace to liberty. They\noloso the doors of business oppor\ntunity to all but the rich and power\nful. They impoverish the prodnoer\nsud consumer. They degrade labor.\nThey have seized upon the avenues\nof transportation aDd poisoned the\nfountains of public information.\nThey debauch the elective franchise.\nThey are pnblio enemies. Unless\nthey are overthrown there will be\nestablished in free America a monied\noligarchy on the one hand and a serf\ndom of the masses of the people on\ntho other. They must be destroyed\nor free government is lost. The only\npower capable of successfully com\nbatting the tyranny of these gigantic\ncapitalistic monopolies is the sronsed\nand organized hosts of the people to\nwhom the government and the conn\ntry rightfully belong and in whom\nall power of right inheres.\n“Oar repuhlio was born of the\nlove of liberty which in 1770 im\npelled the fathers to rebel against the\ntyranny of the English monarch and\nthe special privileges of the British\naristocracy, and which inspired them\nto pledge to the canso of human\nfreedom their lives, their fortunes\nand their sacred honor.”\nThe call sets February 12 as the\ndate and Chicago the place of meet\ning, and continues:\n"Patriotic citizens from all States\nand Territories, duly accredited and\nin full sympathy with the objects\nabove named, and representatives of\nknown Anti Trust organizations, are\ninvited to meet together in said con\nference.\n“Application for admission to said\nconference should be made to the\nBeoretsry, Unity Building, Chicago,\nat an early date, as credentials of\ndelegates must be oountersigned by\nthe chairman of the Executive Com\nmittee.”\nII* Piiatted lb* Muttou.\nIt ii told of a certain lazy man in\nthis city that in order to save himself\nany inoonvienoe, when be bad bis\nhouse remodeled be included an\nautomatio batb tub. The tnb was\nso arranged that he oould lie in bed\nand upon pushing a button the door\nopened and the tub glided in from\nthe next room to the side of the bed.\nthen all be bad to do was to roll\nover into the tub and take bis morn\ning batb. The other day be was\nshowing a party of gentlemen friends\nover the bouse when be came to his\nroom and said, "Let me abow you\nmy antomatio batb tub." He push\ned the button. There was a scream\nand the tub came sailing into the\nroom with bis wife in it. She now\ntakes her batb in the wash pan.—\nKansas City Herald.\nThe Lalnl X Kay lu veil lion.\nIs the Endoscope, which is (or the\npurpose of examining the interior of\nthe stomach.

It is the standard medi\ncine of the American people. Look\n.?r\'T8t8 Revenue Stamp over\noeok of bottle.\nPKOPUNKD LEtlllU PLAN.\nSenator Wolcott of Colorado has\nintroduced a bill which outlines a\nplan for leasing the arid lands of the\nWest. It is probable that the bill\nwill be considered by the National\nLivestock Convention which meets\nat Fort Worth, Texas, this month,\nand that recommendations regarding\nit will be made by that body. In\nbrief the provisions of the bill are as\nfollows:\nThat the lands be leased by tbe\npublio land offices at not less than 2\nper centum per annnm on the ap\npraised valne of the lands, the ap\npraisement to be made by the Boards\nof County Commissioners in the\ndifferent counties, lease to be not\nless than five or more than twenty\nyears, and only for agricnltural or\ngrazing purposes. The first year’s\nrent goes to the Government, and\nafter the first year the money is\nturned over to tbo different Btates\nand Territories wherein the lands are\nlocated, to be placed in a “public\nland development fund” to bo ap\nplied to the "development, diversion,\nstorage and distribution of water for\nirrigation, livestock and domestic\npurposes,” under rules and regula\ntions to be made by State and Terri\ntorial Legislatures. Those owning\nland under the homestead or desert\nland laws are grented the preferred\nright to lease at the minimum any\nlands they desire at the rate of ten\nacres for each one they hold by fee\nor title. At the expiration of lease,\nholder has preference in releasing,\nor if leased to some one else, tbe new\nlesree pays for all improvements\nmade; all developments, water stor\nage or ditches, trees, etc., being re\ngarded as improvements. The bill\nprovides that lands leased shall be\nwithdrawn from entry under home\nstead and desert land laws.\nMTEWAKr neaiEs.\nThe Carson Appeal publishes the\nfollowing regarding the report that\nSenator Stewart has gone into the\nRepublican camp.\nNow that the Presidential cam\npaign is approaching the gold press\nis at its old tactics reporting the\nchanging of prominent Silver men to\nthe ranks of the gold standard. Sen\nator Stewart has been reported as\nhaving deserted the cause of silver.\nA few days ago Surveyor General\nKelley wrote him of the reports in\nthis State regarding hla alleged\nchange to the Republican ranks, and\nyesterday the following dispatob came\nfrom the Senator:\nWashixotox, Jan. 2, 1900.\nHon. E, D. Kelley:—Letter le\noeived. Report that I have aband\noned silver or obanged any of my\nprinciples ifa another oanard of pre\ncisely the same obaraoter and prob\nably invented for the same purpose\nas the one that appeared a year and a\nhalf ago in the New York Times.\nThat paper published a statement\npurporting to be an interview in\nwhich it made mo say that I had\nturned gold-bog, when in faot I bad\nno interview at all. The present\nstory is one of the same fabrication.\nWm. M. Stewabt.\nKverjr Con ureas Hive Ha Carpet\nThe Dew carpet on the floor of the\nHouse of Representatives is pretty to\nthe eye anil yielding to the touch.\nEvery Congress has its carpet. Con\ngresses of even numbers have red car\npets, Congresses of odd numbers have\ngreen carpets—that is, in the one red\nis the dominant color, and in the\nthe other green dominates. As this\nis the Fifty-sixth Congress—an even\nnumber—the carpet is red, and a\nvery fine carpet it is too. There are\n1,400 yards of it, and 200 yards more\nof it are laid away to piece it and\npatch it for the seoond session. The\noarpet of the last Congress is now\nspread on the floors of various com\nmittee rooms, and that will be the\nfuteof its successor two years hence.\n“Mr. Dooley’s” summary of Presi\ndent McKinley’s policy toward "the\ncolonies" tits it "like the paper on the\nwall.” Here it is: "As f’r our newly\nacquired possessions, ’tis our intintion\nto give thim a form iv government\nsuited to their needs, which is small,\nan, in short, to do as we blamed please\nwith them, makin’ up our minds as W(j\ngo along."—Hartford Times.\nMweeta to tbe bweet.\nTea Garden Drips it an abaolotal; pars\ntable syrup For tale by all irooert. •\nciisn or APPENDicrria.\nDr. Oeorge M. Edebebls Las an\ninteresting article on appendioitii\nin a late number of the Medical Rec\nord. He says that probably the first\nteference to the disease dates from\n1842, bat as late as 1838 the know\nledge of its existence was by nc\nmeans general. In 1848 cases began\nto be reported. The first recorded\noperation was performed in 1883, and\nthe first successful operation in 1888.\nSince that time the number of suc\ncessful operations haa greatly increas\ned until, while now it is regarded as\na serious, it is by no means a fatal\noperation. There is much popular\nmisconception as to the origin of\nappendicitis, and Dr. Edebohls gives\ninteresting aocounts of some things\nwhich have been found in the vermi\nform appendix, from which it will\nbe teen that the grape seed is by no\nmeans the commonest cause of injury\nCoprolithshave been found by e\\\nbody who has bad much to do witii\npost mortem inveatigations or with\noperations on the appendix. Next\nto them pins have been the foreign\nbodies most frequently met with.\nOther things found are grape\nseeds, melon seeds, a chocolate nut,\na grain of oat, cherry stones, rasp\nberry seeds, prune seeds, orange\nseeds, date seeds, tomato seeds,\nfruit stones, huckleberry seeds,\nblackberry seeds, hazelnut shell, a\npiece of chestnut, peanuts, hair,\nbristle, a glazier\'s point of zino, a\nglobule of solder, a gelatine capsule,\na piece of bone, a piece of screw nail,\na rifle cartridge and the flu of a fish.\nThis paper also shows that four per\nceDt of all women have appendicitis,\nand they are a very little more liable\nto the disease than men.\nWATEHN Or DEATH.\nLyon County Times: The death\nof Robert Watson, a cattlo man, after\ndrinking the waters of "Death\nSpring” in the Rabbit Hole Moun\ntains, again brings into prominence\nthis terror of Nevada stockmen.\nThe spring is situated in Humboldt\ncounty, Nev. Its waters are so im\npregnated with arsenic that death\nresults to most ereatures that drink\nit. Running from the spring is a\ntioy stream, clear as crystal, which\nsinks into the ground about 100 yards\nfrom the spring. Along the banks\nof this stream are to be found the\nbones of hundreds of small animals,\nand even of deer, sheep and cattle\nthat have drank of the water and\ndied.\nStockmen have built a high fence\nabout the spring and, so far as pos\nsible. have enoloaed the stream. It\nseems impossible, however, to keep\nstook from drinking the water. Sit\nuated many miles from any other\nwater supply, cattle will get to it\nno matter what precautions are taken\nto prevent them. Hundreds of head\nof stock are lost eaob year on aoconnt\nof it.\nWUITK FINK COUNTY HUMS*\n[From the New* uf Jen. 4 ]\nThe Commissioners of White Pine\ncounty have made the tax levy for\n1900. It is the same as last year,\nviz: $3 85 on each one hundred dol\nlars valuation.\nAt the last meeting of the Board\nof Commissioners ninety-four pieces\nof County Script, valued at 82,185 95,\nwere redeemed for 81,719 95. Bids\nranging from 49V% ots. to 85 cts.\nwere aooepted, 8586 90 worth bring\ning the latter figure.\nCounty Treasurer J. B. William\nson left on yesterday morning\'s stage\nvia Cherry Creek, to spend a two\nmonths, vacation in travel through\nCalifornia. A trip to the Hawaiian\nIslands will probably be inoluded.\nDuring his absence W. N.
