Thus, trust and credit are undoubted basis for our social composition, especially at current \nstage, where e-commerce or e-trade mode change our traditional way of life significantly. One interesting \nthing we are witnessing is that, more and more popularity of the online second-hand product market, so how \nto understand trust game theory properly, with follow-up the rule to implement in this market, is essentially \nimportant for both of the buyer and the seller. Herein this article, some real cases’ studies from China second \nhand market will help reader for this purpose illustration. This study contains much of the current study and \ndiscoveries of trust game and second-hand transaction market in China. Based on the previous knowledge, \nthe suggestions for both consumers and the second-hand market producers are given.  \n1 Introduction \nWhat we may need specially in modern society \ndevelopment, unilateralism or Multilateralism? It is the \nmost popular topic, or maybe an argument. After four \ndecades of development in globally post-Cold War era, \nMultilateralism has become the fundamental part, no \nmatter on manufacture supply chain, global service, \nbanking and trading, or even the considerable approach in \nglobal diplomatic affairs in some particular areas with \ninternational dispute. However, no matter of \nUnilateralism or Multilateralism there might be in the \nworld, the most essential part indeed or behind of such \nargument, is the trust among of ourselves to build and \nmaintain, as well as the positive or negative result brought \nfrom such trust. By reading and learning from this article, \nthere would be something expected to output and \nintroduce the readers about the basic theory of the trust \ngame, some real cases specially in China second hand \nmarket, in relation to trust game implementation, as well \nas what is important to build trust game model and how \nthe steps are moving forward.  \n2 Literature Review \n2.1 Background and Rules of Trust Game \nAccroding to Wikibooks, the Trust Game designed by \nBerg Et Al. is a choice experiment to measure the degree \nof trust in economic decision-making.[1] The purpose of \nthe experiment is to prove that trust is primitive means, or \nwithout trust, no business neither any transaction are \nincurred, because trust is the basis to be set-up prior to any \neconomics transaction, however unfortunately, this is not \nthe fundamental part of mainstream economics. The \nsuccess of this experiment proves that trust first is \nproblematic for the basic assumptions of standard \neconomics, which tends to ignore trust. Like the other \ngame theory in Behaviour Economics (such as Prisoners’ \nDilemma game and Public Goods Game), cooperation can \nbenefit the players, but selfish and rational players would \nnot cooperate, which is incompatible with the Assumption \nof Economic Man. \nIn the Trust Game, players are randomly assigned \nroles A and B. A is the first mover and B is the second \nmover. A and B is given an initial payoff, which usually \nto be 10 dollars. The first mover can choose between exit \nand engage. If the first mover chooses exit then the game \nends, without the second mover making a decision, and \nthe payoffs are (10, 10). If A chooses engage, A can \ndecide privately whether to send 0, 1, …, 10 of his/her \nbills to B, and B will be given triple that amount by the \nexperimenter. B then need to decide whether to send some, \nall, or none of them back to A, and then the game end. The \nfinally payoff would be the number of money in A and \nB’s hand. \n2.2 Second-hand Market in China \n2.2.1 Growing Trend of Second-hand Market: \nAccording to Forward-The Economist, China's secondhand\nidle market has exceeded 700 billion yuan in 2018, \nwith a compound growth rate of more than 40% in 20142018.\nBased on this growth, it is expected that by 2020, the \ndomestic second-hand market will reach trillions of dollars. \n[4] It is obvious that although the increasing rate is \n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Second-hand Market Transaction value in China (Unit: 10Million Yuan, %)Different Selling Patterns in Second-hand \nMarket: There are two main modes of platform for second-hand transactions: C2C and C2B2C. \nThe mode C2C selling by providing a platform to \nmatch individual buyers and sellers directly, the two sides \nnegotiate a price to reach a deal. In China, there are \nplatforms like ‘Xianyu’ and ‘Zhuanzhuan’.  \nHowever, the C2C model has risks in the transaction \nof high-value products(such as used mobile phones) in the \nfollowing areas:  \nTime cost:  \nAccording to a survey and analysis of Digital in 2017 \nGlobal View issued by Accenture, about 62% of \ntransaction paid by mobile and users believe that "the time \nand price of the transaction is equally important". \nQuality issues:  \nIt would be difficult for buyers to judge with the naked \neye whether there are potential quality issues since C2C \ntransactions are uploaded by individual sellers. Faced \nwith this problem, some platforms introduced the quality \nchecking service, which is like to provide B services in \nthe C2C model. As the buyer and seller make a deal, the \nbuyer can choose to send the good first to the platform, \nquality checking will be done by the platform and a report \nwill be send to the buyer. Then buyer and seller will \nconfirm their transaction, and the good will be delivery to \nbuyer from the platform. This effectively reduces quality \nproblems of the goods.  \nPrivacy disclosure:  \nSome second-hand goods like personal mobile phones \noften store a large amount of personal information \ninvolving privacy issues. So, in transactions without \nplatform protection, information leakage may easily \nhappen. \nThe mode C2B2C was first published by a Chinese \nplatform named ‘Zhuanzhuan’. The C2B2C model was \ndesigned based on the problems appeared in the model \nC2C. In the C2B2C model, the platform plays a character \nas a middleman, a second-hand trading trust endorsement \nand bridge. It means that the platform will take the risk \nand solve the trusting problems of both sides of the \ntransaction. For the platform, there will be two main \ncharacteristics: \nValue added service: \nThe platform need to prepay part of the price for users, \nthen pass the quality checking, re-price the goods with \nmore accurate recovery price as the starting price to enter \nthe second-hand market, where the seller shall get further \ncompensation on top of the advanced payment from the \nplatform, if the final selling result was higher than the \nmarket recovery price after the reassessment by platform. \nNeed single standard the quality requirements: \nThe goods need to pass the quality checking and \nquality assurance.  \n3 Building a game model \n3.1 Introduction of this model \nIn this model, buyer and seller would be regarded as the \nplayers. Buyer is the first mover and seller is the second \nmover. Buyer can choose to buy or not to buy goods from \nthe seller, and the seller can return a same, similar or \ndifferent good to the buyer. Such would happen in real life \nwhile people buying from a C2C second-hand platform. \n3.2 Buyers’ Initial Trust \n3.2.1 The risks for buyers (related to the Trust Game \nand Economic Person Assumption): The Economic \nPerson Assumption has pretending that people are \ncompletely rational and selfish, which means that both side \nof the game will only care about their benefits. While the \nsellers only care about their own benefits, they will try to \nachieve a higher selling price with a lower production cost. \nIn a second-hand market, the production cost is not \nundertaken by the seller, so the only thing they care about \nwould probably be the selling price.  \nIn order to make a higher selling price, the seller would \nprobably try their best to let the consumer believe that their \ngoods are still new and usable, and it worth the higher price \nthat given by the seller.  \nAlso, most second-hand trading platform has its own \nshortcomings that sellers will usually set up slogans like \n1328.2\n2099.6\n4004.3\n5707.8\n7400\n8834\n10409\n58.08%\n90.72%\n42.54%\n29.65%\n19.38% 17.83%\n0.00%\n20.00%\n40.00%\n60.00%\n80.00%\n100.00%\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\nTransaction volume in 2nd market (100 Million)\nYoY change ratio (%)\n2\nE3S Web of Conferences 235, 03081 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202123503081\nNETID 2020\n', ' \n"second-hand items, do not accept return or exchange", \nwhich means that buyers after payment cannot deal with \nthe good they get if they are unsatisfied due to non-human \nfactors. \nSo, under the assumption of Economic Person, the \nbuyer probably need to take a risk of getting a \nunsatisfactory or defective products at a higher price. \n3.2.2 Factors influencing the initial trust of buyers: \nAccording to Lu, initial trust is the early and most \nimportant stage of trust development. In e-commerce \ntransactions, online merchants are the trusted parties who \nhave the opportunity to grasp the weaknesses of consumers, \nwhile consumers are the vulnerable party. In current \nincreasing environment of e-commerce, consumers have \nencountered many problems of transaction dishonesty, so \ne-commerce transactions are increasingly cautious. The \ninitial trust of consumers is for an e-commerce initial \ntransaction, and consumers generally can only rely on \nlimited information to determine the level of trust in the \nseller. [3] \nFactors that have an influence on the initial trust of \nbuyers include followings: \nCustomers’ perception: \nGreat reputation usually need a long time managing, so \nthe reputation of sellers will be an important sign to decide \nthe which seller would be better. In a general way, most of \nthe consumers are more willing to trust those sellers who \nhave a great reputation. This is because buyers consider \nthat these sellers caring more about the buyers’ benefit \ninstead of doing opportunistic behaviors. [3]Personal \npropensity to trust: \nPersonal propensity to trust in a second-hand \ntransaction shows the personal will of buyers to whether \ntrust or not a particular seller. According to Lu, personal \npropensity to trust is a relatively stable personality trait, \ngenerally not easily affected by other factors. [3] For \ninstance, someone cares a lot about the pictures of the \ngoods given by the sellers, and this would be a personal \npropensity to trust for them. \n3.3 Sellers’ Pay Back \n3.3.1 Sellers’ possible action (related to the Trust \nGame and Economic Person Assumption): As the \nsellers are completely rational and selfish, they would \nprobably not care about either if the consumer will have a \ngood feedback for them, or the consumers’ benefit. So, it \nwould be possible that the sellers will do something \nopportunistic in order to make a greater benefit on \nthemselves. \n3.3.2 Sellers’ possible action in real life: As the above \nhas mentioned that consumers’ perception is one of the \nimportant determinants of the initial trust, it is impossible \nfor sellers to ignore the feedback from buyers in real life. \nThe reputation of a particular seller will have an influence \non the future consumer number of this seller. So, to make \na consider in long run, if the seller wants to make sure \nhis/her goods are still welcomed by buyers, reputation \nshould be take into consideration, and that is the reason \nwhy most sellers in real life will not give the consumer an \nunsatisfied transaction experience. \n4 Analysis \nThe seller will choose to keep or not keep a good \nreputation, and the buyer will choose to buy or not to buy \ngoods out of consideration of the seller\'s credit degree. \nAccroding to Yang and Liu, suppose the probability of \nthe buyer buying the goods is P1 and the probability of not \nbuying the goods is 1-p1. The probability of the seller \nbuying in good faith is P2, and the probability of \ndishonesty is 1-p2. E is the value of the commodity \n(expressed in terms of price), D1 is the cost of the \ncommodity when the seller conducts business in good faith, \nand D2 is the cost of the seller when it conducts business \nin bad faith (usually D2 & LT;D1). [5] \nTABLE I.  MATRIX OF E-COMMERCE SECOND-HAND TRADING \nPLATFORM [5] \n Seller \nBuyer \n Credit (P2) No-credit (1-P2) \nPurchase (P1) e, e-d1 -e, e-d2-n \nNo purchase (1-P1) 0, -d1 0, -d2 \nWhen the seller and the buyer make a choice with \ndifferent probabilities, their expected payoff are also \ndifferent, and both the buyer and the seller will make the \nchoice that maximizes their expected payoff. \nFor the buyers, when 2P2-1<0, then P1=0, U1 is the \nmaximum, which is 0; when 2P2-1=0, then while \n0<=P1<=1, U1 is maximum, which is 0; when 2P2-1>0, \nthen P1=1, U1 is the maximum, which is -d1P2+e P1-n P1d2+n\nP1P2+d2P2 [5]. \nFor the sellers, when d2-d1+nP1<0, thenP2=0, U2 is \nthe maximum, which is (e-n)P1-d2; when d2-d1+nP1=0, \nthen 0<=P2<=1, U2 is maximum, which is (e-n)P1-d2; \nwhen d2-d1+nP1>0, then P2=1, U2 is the maximum, \nwhich is (e-n)P1- d2 [5]. \nSo, in general speaking, we can see that the probability \nthat a buyer chooses whether or not to buy goods is related \nto the probability that a seller chooses whether or not to be \nin good faith, which means that the probability that the \nseller chooses to keep the promise depends on the \nmagnitude of d1, d2, and n. While in the real life, the seller \nintegrity transaction is very important for the consumer to \nprotect their legitimate rights and interests, and this is \nconsistent with the results obtained in the model. \n5 Suggestions \n5.1 Suggestions for Second-hand transaction \napps (C2C) \nIt would be important for second-hand transaction \nplatforms to make regular survey to get known about their \nown reputation from users. It would be better for them if \nthey can collect the users’ suggestion and improve it on \ntime. Doing so will both increase the number of new users \nand strengthen the loyalty of older users to the platform. \n3\nE3S Web of Conferences 235, 03081 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202123503081\nNETID 2020\n', ' \n5.2 Suggestions for buyers \nThe initial trust from buyers actually cannot be influenced \nby experience since those transactions may happen \ndiscretely. So it is also hard to influence the initial trust \nfrom buyers. \n5.3 Suggestions for sellers \nIt would be better for sellers if they care more about their \nsecond-hand goods. The pictures put online should be as \nreal as possible, and the good should with a proper price. \nThese can help the seller to build a better reputation. \n6 Conclusion \nIn conclusion, according to the analysis above, it is \nobvious that there is a strong connection between trust and \nthe second-hand transaction. At present, many Internet \nsecond-hand transaction platforms have taken a series of \nreasonable and effective measures to facilitate the online \ncredit transactions between buyers and sellers. All kinds of \nschemes are used, and it forms the credit evaluation system \nof users and solves the trust problem between users. The \nsecond-hand transaction platforms are gradually deal with \nthose trust problems. \nAcknowledgement \nFirst and foremost, I would like to show my deepest \ngratitude to my teachers in my school and Professor Louis \nPutterman, who have provided me with valuabe guidance \nin every stage of the writing of this thesis.
