        <pre>['106\nNATO’s strategic functions—keeping the\nUnited States in Europe, locking Germany\ninto a web of transatlantic institutions, integrating\na pro-Western Russia, and maintaining peace\nin the still-unstable Balkans—are at risk. Meeting in\nPrague in November 2002, the alliance invited seven\nEast European countries to begin the process of\nbecoming members. It was an auspicious moment:\nNATO had completed the process of removing the\nartificial barriers imposed on Europe by Soviet\nleader Joseph Stalin in the 1940s. This dramatic\nbreak with the past, however, also undermines the\nalliance’s ability to adapt to the security challenges\nof the present—especially terrorism. Unless the\nUnited States Senate—which must ratify the enlargement\ndecision—uses the debate over a larger\nalliance to demand reforms that would make NATO\nrelevant to the twenty-first century, this round of\nenlargement might be NATO’s last gasp. \nMOVING EASTWARD\nThe new round of membership invitations to\nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania,\nand Bulgaria continues NATO’s enlargement on\nthe basis of political rather than military needs. Until\n1999, when Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic\nbecame members, every previous enlargement\nhad a basic strategic rationale. What became NATO in\n1948 and 1949 began as three-way discussions\namong the United States, Canada, and the United\nKingdom, which were soon joined by France, Belgium,\nLuxembourg, and the Netherlands. As the\ntreaty negotiations progressed, Denmark, Norway,\nIceland, Italy, and Portugal were added as founding\nmembers. During the cold war, NATO grew to include\nGreece, Turkey, West Germany, and Spain. In each\ncase, NATO enlarged to bolster collective defense\nagainst Soviet aggression. Political criteria did not\nguide enlargement. NATO was an alliance to deter\nagainst external attack and its membership was\nguided by strategic calculations. \nNATO’s collective defense demands also meant\noverlooking gross violations of the same liberal principles\nthat the alliance had promised to secure. NATO\nincluded Portugal as a founding member even\nthough it was governed by an authoritarian dictatorship.\nIn 1967 a military junta took over Greece—\nusing a NATO counterinsurgency plan. NATO lived\nwith this unconstitutional overthrow of democracy\nfor seven years. In the case of Turkey, the military\nhas carried out many extraconstitutional seizures of\npower, and freedoms of speech and expression have\noften been curtailed. \nAt the same time, NATO has helped mollify tensions\nbetween Greece and Turkey, two historical\nenemies, but in crises it was the exertion of American\npower outside NATO that prevented war\nbetween them from the 1960s into the 1990s. And\nNATO’s inclusion of West Germany reassured its\nneighbors that, when rearmed, it was the key cold\nwar frontline state. \nThe end of the cold war provided a compelling\nreason to link NATO membership with political, economic,\nand military reform. By integrating new\ndemocracies into NATO’s internal political consultation,\ninformation sharing, and multilateral military\nplanning, the alliance could act as a powerful force\nfor the projection of stability into Central and Eastern\nEurope. Before receiving an invitation to join,\naspirants were expected to uphold democracy, the\nrule of law, and free markets. They were also to\nensure proper treatment of ethnic minorities and\nthe administration of social justice as elaborated by\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\n“NATO’s new enlargement will further complicate the workings of an alliance\nthat is already politically unmanageable, militarily dysfunctional, and strategically\nirrelevant.”\nPutting NATO Back Together Again\nSEAN KAY\nSEAN KAY, an associate professor of politics and government at\nOhio Wesleyan University and a nonresident fellow at the\nEisenhower Institute in Washington, D.C., is coeditor of Limiting\nInstitutions: The Challenge of Eurasian Security Gover-\nnance (Manchester, U.K.: Manchester University Press, 2003).\n', 'Europe; resolution of territorial disputes on the\nbasis of good neighborly relations; and democratic,\ncivilian control of the military. NATO invitees were\nalso required to demonstrate that they were willing\nto bear the economic costs of membership and were\nprepared to contribute to the full range of NATO missions,\nincluding collective defense. To ease this pro-\ncess, NATO created a program of political and\nmilitary outreach to the east and to Europe’s neutral\ncountries through its 1994 Partnership for\nPeace. NATO enhanced this process in 1999 by creating\na Membership Action Plan under which can-\ndidates for accession are evaluated annually on their\nefforts to meet membership criteria.\nIn 1999, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic\nentered NATO. As with previous enlargements,\nthere was a strong geostrategic premise for including\nPoland in the alliance. By extending American\npower through NATO between a rising unified Germany\nand a declining post-Soviet Russia, the historic\nrisk of great power competition over this strategic\narea could be reduced. But NATO limited the\ngeostrategic promise of enlargement by excluding\nRomania, which could have provided important military\nand geographic assets, and by including the\nCzech Republic and Hungary, which offered\nmarginal military or strategic gains. Although it had\nthe support of a majority of NATO members, Romania\nwas rejected by Washington because of insuffi-\ncient political and economic reform and because the\nClinton administration believed that the Senate\nwould accept only a small enlargement package in\n1997. Hungary and the Czech Republic boasted the\nmoral stature of leaders such as Vaclav Havel,\nimpressive postcommunist political and economic\ntransformations, and a strong domestic lobby inside\nthe United States. \nWith the inclusion of the Czech Republic and\nHungary, NATO embarked on a politically openended\nenlargement. If the Czechs were included,\nwhy not the three Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia,\nand Lithuania?\nThe drive toward NATO by former Soviet bloc\nmembers was motivated by a political desire to join\nthe West and to be rewarded for liberal political and\neconomic reform. Most aspirant states were also\nmotivated by a historical wish to escape the long\nshadow of Russian power. Yet in attaining their\npolitical objectives, these countries accelerated the\ntransformation of NATO into an organization that no\nlonger provides direct security guarantees. NATO has\nenlarged politically, but not militarily. No troops, no\nnuclear weapons, and no infrastructure for nuclear\nweapons are to be deployed on the territory of new\nmembers. NATO asserts that allied forces will consider\nreinforcing the territory of a new ally only if\nit is threatened. And NATO will try to gain consensus\namong all its members to fight a war on the ter-\nritory of a new member state—but not to provide\nfor direct security guarantees.\nWhen NATO waged war over Kosovo in 1999,\nserious operational limitations were exposed; its\nrules and procedures prevented development of an\nefficient war-fighting plan, and only the United\nStates and Britain were sufficiently prepared to project\nmodern military power. Since the Kosovo war,\nthe United States has rapidly deemphasized NATO\nfor military planning to prevent small, noncontributing\nallies from vetoing American military pri-\norities. The war in Afghanistan in 2001 further\ndemonstrated that  NATO was no longer central to\nUnited States strategic interests. NATO is growing,\nbut its deterrent functions, military capability, and\npolitical effectiveness are diminishing.\nENLARGEMENT AND SEPTEMBER 11 \nUnlike the 1997 enlargement invitations to\nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, the decision\nin 2002 to open the institution to seven new\ncountries sparked little debate. This was startling\nbecause of the implications the enlargement would\nhave for NATO’s relevance. The central question in\n1997 was whether NATO enlargement would provoke\nhostility from Russia. By 2002 Russia had\nreconsidered its opposition. Russian leaders evidently\nunderstood, perhaps better than many Euro-\npean and American officials, that NATO’s growth\nwould seriously dilute the organization’s military\neffectiveness, which would serve Russia’s interests.\nMoscow also made significant gains when, in May\n2002, it was invited to join a NATO–Russia council\nin which it would have veto authority over joint\nactivities, including weapons proliferation, peace\nsupport operations, and counterterrorism.\nWithout Russian opposition, NATO enlargement\nwould seem to have been a fairly simple proposition.\nIt was not always clear, however, that Presi-\ndent George W. Bush would support NATO\nexpansion. The trend away from NATO’s military\ncore seemed to contradict the president’s 2000 campaign\npromises. Bush’s platform included strength-\nening United States alliances. Policies that severely\ndiluted America’s most important alliance—NATO—\nwould undermine his objective. After coming to\noffice, Bush appointed senior officials, such as\nnational security adviser Condoleezza Rice, who\nPutting NATO Back Together Again • 107\n', 'had warned against expanding NATO too quickly at\nthe expense of its military effectiveness, and Secretary\nof Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who had argued\nfor a reduction in America’s commitment to major\nNATO operations in the Balkans. Secretary of State\nColin Powell was known to have been skeptical of\nNATO enlargement during his chairmanship of the\nJoint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1990s. \nNevertheless, a small group of NATO enlargement\nadvocates—including some Republican Senate staff\nmembers, defense industry lobbyists, and neoconservative\nofficials in the\nDepartment of\nDefense and\nOffice of the\nVice President—\npushed in early\n2001 to create\na “snowball” of\nmomentum at\na time when\nopponents were\nnot paying attention.\nBy June,\nPresident Bush\nwas calling for\na broad expansion\nof NATO. \nA bigger NATO\nwould demonstrate\nto Russia\nthat the United\nStates had freedom\nof move-\nment in Russia’s\nt r a d i t i o n a l\nsphere of influence.\nNATO enlargement would also undercut the\ngrowing appeal of the European Union as a security\nalternative for countries from Central and Eastern\nEurope. Domestically, NATO enlargement became an\nimportant part of the neoconservative foreign policy\nagenda of spreading American primacy.\nAmerica’s response to the September 11 terrorist\nattacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.\naltered the strategic calculation for NATO. Immediately\nfollowing the attacks, America’s NATO allies\ninvoked Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, declaring\nthose events as attacks on them all. NATO carried\nout symbolic, but limited, operational responses,\nincluding patrolling American airspace with AWAC\nsurveillance planes and initiating naval operations in\nthe Mediterranean Sea to interdict terrorist movements.\nBut Washington’s bilateral relationships with\nRussia and a few other countries and individual allies\nlike Turkey became more important than working\nthrough the multilateral channels of NATO. When the\nEuropean NATO members offered to assist the United\nStates in its war in Afghanistan, Washington declined\nthe offer. Although European allies have contributed\nforces to peace support operations since the collapse\nof the Taliban, this has not been a formal NATO operation\nbecause Washington explicitly rejected Euro-\npean offers to\nengage in actual\nwarfighting in\nAfghanistan.\nSince the\nSeptember 11\nattacks, NATO\nhas experienced\na fundamental\nd i s c o n n e c t\nbetween its\ngrowing political\nfunction\nand its declining\nmilitary-\ns t r a t e g i c\nr e l e v a n c e .\nNATO’s role in\nthe campaign\nagainst terrorism\nhas been\nextremely limited,\neven though\ninternational\nterrorism is\nnow the only\ns i g n i f i c a n t\nthreat its members face. When NATO leaders met in\nPrague in November 2002, they confronted the\nchallenge of aligning enlargement with the realities\nof the changed threat environment.\nREFORM AT PRAGUE\nThe Prague summit’s most important development\nwas not, as many observers initially expected,\nNATO’s enlargement. Rather, the summit established\na foundation for further major NATO reform. \nAt Prague, NATO members began to modernize\nthe institution’s power-projection capabilities by\norganizing a NATO Response Force. By 2006, NATO is\nto develop a force of about 21,000 troops that will\nbe technologically advanced, deployable, interop108\n• CURRENT HISTORY • March 2003\nHUNGARY\nALBANIA\nPOLAND\nLITHUANIA\nLATVIA\nESTONIA\nROMANIA\nBULGARIA\nG\nR\nE E C E\nT U R K E Y\nUNITED\nKINGDOM\nS P A I N\nPORTUGAL\nFRANCE\nBELGIUM\nNETHERLANDS\nDENMARK\nGERMANY\nICELAND\nNORWAY\nSWEDEN\nFINLAND\nSWITZ.\nAUSTRIALIECH.\nLUX.\nANDORRA\nIRELAND\nMALTA\nRUSSIA\nCZECH  REP.\nSLOVAKIA\nR U S S I A\nBELARUS\nUKRAINE\nMOLDOVA\nSLOVENIA\nBOSNIA AND\nHERZEGOVINA\nMACEDONIA\nCRO A T I A\nYU\nG\nO\nSLA\nV\nIA\nI\nT\nA\nL\nY\nAegean\nSea\nMediterranean Sea\nAdriatic\nSea\nIonian\nSea\nTyrrhenian\nSea\nOCEAN\nATLANTIC\nNorth\nSea\nIrish Sea\nNorwegian\nSea\nBlack\nSea\nBaltic\nSea\n0 200 600   Miles400\nNATO members*\nNew members as of March 1999\nApplicants for membership,\nNovember 2002\n*The U.S. and Canada are also NATO members.\nNORTH  ATLANTIC\nTREATY  ORGANIZATION\n© Current History, Inc.\n', 'erable, and sustainable; include land, sea, and air\nelements; and maintain the capability to move\nquickly to wherever it might be needed. To this end\na “Prague Capabilities Commitment” was\nannounced. Building on core United States and\nBritish capabilities, members promised to improve\ntheir ability to operate in a threat environment that\nincludes new challenges such as chemical, biological,\nradiological, and nuclear weapons. They will\nalso improve intelligence, surveillance, and target\nacquisition; command, control, and communications;\ncombat effectiveness, including the use of\nprecision-guided munitions and better suppression\nof enemy air defenses; strategic lift and sea lift; airto-air\nrefueling; and deployable combat support and\ncombat service units. NATO also agreed to implement\nwork on civil emergency planning and to\ndevelop further its institutional capacity for managing\nthe proliferation, and possible use by terror-\nists, of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe NATO Response Force was an important step\ntoward making NATO more relevant to meeting the\nnew collective defense\nneeds of its members.\nBut how NATO’s enlargement\ndecision fits into\nthis revised force concept\nis unclear. NATO’s\nrecent additions might\nfocus primarily on new “niche” capabilities they can\nbring to the NATO Response Force. Thus they could\nclaim they are contributing directly to NATO’s defense\nrequirements without increasing defense spending\nor modernizing their overall forces. Yet if the new\nNATO members focus only on niche contributions to\nthe force, it would undermine the kind of deployments\nNATO is most likely to undertake: peacekeep-\ning and peace support operations following an\nintervention by coalitions of the willing acting outside\nNATO decision-making procedures but still ben-\nefiting from shared cooperative planning, training,\nand exercises within NATO. As has been made clear in\nAfghanistan—and most likely in any postinvasion\nIraq peace support operations—it is after major military\naction that European forces may be in greatest\ndemand, not at the “spearhead” of any intervention\nforce. Conversely, some invitees might not want the\nfew elite forces and capabilities they develop directed\naway from the perceived territorial defense concerns\nthat initially drove them toward NATO.\nStill, the NATO Response Force is a creative concept\nsince it allows NATO members to pool high-end\nresources without increasing their individual\ndefense budgets. Whether a force of 21,000 that\ndoes not include plans for reinforcements will succeed\nis an open question. Moreover, the failure of\nNATO’s members to link the organization’s counterterrorism\nfunctions to the political, civilian, and\nmultinational police capabilities available in the\nEuropean Union underscores that NATO’s moves to\ndate are half measures. Most important, it is not\nclear how the other major decision taken at\nPrague—to invite seven new members—fits into\nNATO’s new mission.\nFROM BAD TO WORSE\nIf NATO’s political, economic, and military criteria\nfor membership had been fully applied to each\nof the seven invitees, none would have qualified for\ninvitations at the Prague summit. Moreover, if revitalizing\nNATO’s capabilities is crucial to its relevance,\nnone of these countries helps meet that objective.\nThis is a serious challenge for NATO because the previous\nround of enlargement—including Poland,\nHungary, and the Czech Republic—demonstrated\nthat the alliance only\nhas leverage over a\nmember before it is\ninvited. Since joining\nNATO in 1999, all three\ncountries have failed\nto fulfill promises\nregarding unmet membership criteria made during\ntheir membership negotiations and ratification processes.\nEach member has experienced considerable\ndifficulty integrating into NATO structures, fallen\nshort of promised defense investment and armed\nforces restructuring, and found it a challenge even\nfielding representatives who speak English to NATO\nheadquarters. Poland is purchasing, with United\nStates–guaranteed “pay as you can” loans, 48 F-16\nfighter jets—yet the country’s military has no pilots\nwho are able to fly F-16s.\nBecause membership criteria are based on\npre–September 11 security concepts, NATO’s enlargement\nespecially complicates its transition to an\ninstitution capable of meeting new security challenges.\nUnder these criteria, new members are\nexpected to facilitate peace support operations and\nprepare for reinforcement of their territory in the\nunlikely event of a Russia-style conventional threat.\nNATO has never undertaken a post–September 11\nreassessment of membership criteria—even after\nissuing its declaration that terrorism is a collective\ndefense concern. The alliance confronts the problem\nof adapting itself to counterterrorism at the\nPutting NATO Back Together Again • 109\nNATO is growing, but its deterrent functions, \nmilitary capability, and political effectiveness \nare diminishing.\n', 'same time it needs to ensure that new members do\nnot emphasize niche capabilities at the expense of\ntheir ability to contribute to peace support operations.\nThe enlargement experience to date suggests\nthat NATO is headed in a direction that will go from\nbad to worse if significant adjustments in the process\nare not made.\nThe new NATO invitees do have something to\noffer in terms of military capabilities. Romania has\nactive armed forces of 99,200 and defense spending\nof about 2.5 percent of GDP. Its location on the Black\nSea and border with Ukraine enhance its geostrategic\ncontributions. Romania has also sent 400 troops\nto aid in peace support operations in the Afghanistan\nintervention. Bulgaria has active armed forces\nof 68,450 and 2.8 percent of GDP spent annually on\ndefense. Bulgaria also brings a strategic location on\nthe Balkan peninsula and serves as an important\nbridge to Turkey and the Black Sea. After Romania\nand Bulgaria, however, the military and strategic\nvalue of enlargement falls significantly. \nSlovakia serves as a land bridge to Hungary and\nfurther extends the West to the Ukrainian border.\nSlovakia’s active armed forces number 26,200 and\ndefense spending is about 2 percent of GDP. Slovenia\nalso offers a land bridge to Hungary and plays\na symbolic role in NATO because it is a former\nYugoslav state. Slovenia’s active armed forces of\nabout 9,000 and defense budget of 1.5 percent of\nGDP, however, limit its military contribution. \nWith regard to the three Baltic states, Estonia has\narmed forces of 5,510 and spends 1.7 percent of GDP\non defense; Latvia has armed forces of 5,500 and a\ndefense budget of about 1.2 percent of GDP; and\nLithuania has 13,510 active members in its armed\nforces and spends 1.8 percent of GDP on defense.\nThe Baltics have worked together on projects such\nas the first-class BALTNET air surveillance system, but\nthe limited contributions these countries make to\nNATO’s new collective defense mission are encapsulated\nin Estonia’s military commitment in Afghani-\nstan: five men and three dogs.\nThe three Baltic countries and Slovenia are the\nmost politically and economically advanced of the\nseven invitees. Slovakia’s political situation is tenuous:\nthe fall 2002 general election saw an authori-\ntarian and nationalist political leader lose, but\ncompete seriously for victory. Neither Bulgaria nor\nRomania, the two countries that offer the greatest\ngeostrategic value, meets political or economic criteria\nfor NATO membership. Each confronts major\nchallenges: poorly performing economies, the need\nfor military reform, and political corruption. The\nUnited States has also cited Bulgaria for facilitating\nthe transfer of military technology to states that are\npursuing the development of weapons of mass\ndestruction, and in Romania communist-era security\npersonnel still hold key military and intelli-\ngence positions. Bulgaria and Latvia also have\nserious problems with the protection of sensitive\nintelligence secrets. In fact, senior United States\nDefense officials lobbied in the weeks prior to the\nPrague summit to take Bulgaria, Latvia, and Slovenia\n(because of its minimal military contributions\nand low public support for NATO membership) off\nthe invitation list.\nTwo remaining applicants—Albania and Macedonia—were\nkept off the list because they were not\neven close to meeting NATO criteria for admission\nand because they were seen as importing instability\ninto the alliance. Albania’s and Macedonia’s security\nproblems stem from the ongoing tensions in the\nBalkan region and the risk that the collapse of either\nstate could lead to a regional war. NATO is thus providing\nmembership to countries that least need it,\nwhile leaving out those who would benefit the\nmost. (Ironically, since the Kosovo war, NATO\ntroops—including United States forces—have been\nstationed in Albania and Macedonia to provide tangible\nsecurity guarantees.) \nCONSENSUS IN “OLD” AND “NEW” EUROPE\nNATO makes decisions by consensus; all its members\nmust agree on new NATO policy. With 7 new\nmembers, NATO now will require all 26 countries that\nbelong to the alliance to agree before acting (the\nspecial relationship with Russia adds to the complexity\nof the decision-making process). A crisis in\nwhich a member blocked NATO action would accelerate\nthe American drive away from Europe and\ndirect the Europeans toward the European Union as\na place where continental interests might be more\nfully realized. In 2003 this concern became real\nwhen key NATO members Germany and France\nblocked NATO planning for a support role in any\nUnited States–led invasion of Iraq (France also\npromised to lead a common European Union effort\nto delay war).\nWashington is thus likely to project military\npower alone while Europeans look to constrain the\nunilateral power of the United States by strengthening\nthe European Union. These structural diver-\ngences will test NATO’s new members: What is more\nimportant, European or American priorities? The\nnew members might be more reliable in consensus\nbuilding than the “old” NATO allies as they seek to\n110 • CURRENT HISTORY • March 2003\n', 'prove themselves worthy of membership. Indeed,\nin an attempt to exploit this political advantage,\nUnited States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\nsuggested, in the debate over Iraq policy, that\nFrance and Germany represented the “old Europe”\nand that those countries in the East, which better\nunderstood the demand for liberty, represented the\n“new Europe.” Worried that the United States Senate\nmight not ratify their entrance into NATO, the\nseven invitees in the “new Europe” have been eager\nto demonstrate political support for United States\npolicy toward Iraq. But in reality they do not offer\nany serious capabilities for a United States–led\ncoalition in Iraq. \nThe seven new NATO allies are gaining access to\nagenda setting in European security that is not commensurate\nwith their capabilities or geostrategic\nvalue. The ability of any member to block consensus\nmakes it difficult—if not impossible—to ensure\nthat new members emerge as contributors to NATO’s\nprinciples or defense requirements. NATO has no\nmechanism for punishing violators of institutional\nnorms, principles, or procedures, and any member\ncan prevent an action by blocking its discussion.\nThe consequences of inaction can be severe: more\nthan 200,000 people are dead or missing in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina because NATO between 1993 and\n1995 was unable to reach consensus on taking\naction in the former Yugoslav republic. \nExisting NATO rules make decision-making\nreform difficult to achieve. NATO could create a\ncommittee to monitor member adherence to political,\neconomic, and military criteria and issue a\nreport each year to the North Atlantic Council\n(NAC), the alliance’s principal political authority.\nThe NAC could then be endowed with the power to\nsanction noncomplying members—including suspension\nof membership rights or even expulsion.\nSince many current NATO allies do not meet NATO\nstandards, they would likely block the creation of\nsuch a committee. Alternatively, NATO could establish\na “consensus-minus-one” process in which\nNATO could act over the objections of one state\nshould that state be in violation of NATO principles\nand rules. While this too would allow NATO to act\nshort of consensus, it would still require consensus\ninitially to institute the rule change. NATO members\nwould not likely give up their right to block a NATO\naction that violates their own interests. Finally, NATO\ncould form an elite council comprised of its primary\nmilitary contributors, which would include the\nUnited States, Britain, Germany, Turkey, and France\n(France would be included only if it returned to the\nNATO military committee it left in 1966). This council\ncould have rotating members of several smaller\nNATO allies, much like the UN Security Council’s\nframework of permanent and rotating members.\nThis proposal would also require consensus to\nimplement, and the smaller NATO members probably\nwould not cede their institutional leverage. \nMost likely the solution lies in creating such a\nframework outside NATO. A “European Security\nCouncil” would include the United States, Britain,\nFrance, Germany, Turkey, and Russia; the rotating\nmembership would consist of the smaller NATO\nstates. The council could make decisions on behalf\nof Europe, with NATO serving as the mechanism for\nimplementing policy, and requiring consensus to act\nonly on matters of collective defense. NATO members\nwould have to agree in advance not to block\nagreement if the European Security Council were\nin major-power consensus. \nThe need to generate creative institutional decision-making\nreform for European security is urgent.\nIf 26 NATO members cannot make functional decisions,\nand also fail to adapt to new threats, then a\nbroader question may be raised in Washington:\nWhy does the United States still need to station\nnearly 100,000 troops in Europe?\nRATIFYING REAL CHANGE\nNATO’s political leaders appear unwilling to make\nthe hard decisions required to manage the institutional\ncomplexity created by NATO’s new enlarge-\nment. Consequently, the parliaments and legislatures\nof NATO’s members, all of which must ratify the new\nmembers’ accession to the North Atlantic Treaty,\nmay be the last best hope to affect serious change to\nprotect NATO’s relevance. The role of the United\nStates Senate, which requires a two-thirds majority\nfor ratification, is crucial because it will signal the\ndepth of American support for NATO. \nAt first glance the possibilities of Senate engagement\non NATO appear gloomy. The number of sena-\ntors who pay significant attention to NATO has\ndeclined; many have concluded that NATO no longer\nmatters. As recently as 1998, 41 American senators\nsupported an amendment requiring a freeze on\nfuture NATO enlargement. Most likely, the Republican\nmajority in the Senate will follow the Bush\nadministration’s wishes and amend the NATO treaty\nto admit the seven new invitees. But while it may be\npolitically convenient to expedite ratification, failure\nto use this last opportunity to mandate major NATO\nreform would mean that the Senate, and the United\nStates more broadly, no longer takes NATO seriously.\nPutting NATO Back Together Again • 111\n', '112 • CURRENT HISTORY • March 2003\nIn a time of war, should a senator ratify an enlargement\nof NATO that has no relationship to the clear\nand present danger confronting American citizens?\nThe Senate could consider three specific amendments\nto the protocols of accession that would pave\nthe way to admitting the seven new NATO members.\nSenators might require NATO to certify that the seven\ninvitees have met all existing membership criteria\nand to add new criteria for counterterrorism capabilities,\ncontributions to the NATO Response Force,\nand plans to meet the Prague Capabilities Commitment.\nThe amendment would require the Bush\nadministration to establish consensus in NATO for\nthe creation of an “Invitee Action Plan.” Under this\nplan, NATO could create a committee to report back\nto the North Atlantic Council on the degree of\nadherence to all specified membership criteria. Only\nwhen NATO could certify that all criteria had been\nmet by an invitee would the Senate hold a formal\nvote on ratification. If criteria were not met, NATO\nwould begin annual reviews of an invitee’s progress\ntoward that goal. Although this process would\nextend the NATO accession process significantly, it\nwould result in a stronger organization. New members\nwould benefit since this regimen would ensure\nthat they would join NATO as serious contributors\nto its missions and thus carry real political weight.\nThe Senate could use the enlargement process to\nforce even bolder action. Through the amendment\nprocess, the Senate could require the Bush administration\nto develop a comprehensive strategy to\nredesign Europe’s security institutions to combat\nterrorism, beginning with the development of direct\noperational linkages between NATO and the European\nUnion. The Senate could also offer an amend-\nment that would require the Bush administration to\nreview NATO decision-making procedures. This\namendment would establish a timeframe within\nwhich the administration would formally report to\nCongress on the various options for institutional\ndecision-making reform. \nAbsent a quick course redirection from the\nUnited States Senate, NATO’s new enlargement will\nfurther complicate the workings of an alliance that\nis already politically unmanageable, militarily dysfunctional,\nand strategically irrelevant. The Senate\nhas a distinguished history of using its constitutional\nauthority to shape NATO policy, including the\nMansfield and Nunn amendments of the 1960s and\n1970s, which promoted burden sharing between\nthe United States and its European allies. Legislative\npressure has forced various administrations\nand European governments to think harder about\nthe direction in which NATO was headed and produced\ncreative solutions. The new invitees and\ntheir political advocates will insist that their admission\nremain separate from the larger questions con-\nfronting NATO. But this argument ignores the reality\nthat NATO’s current enlargement strategy is fundamental\nto the alliance’s institutional decline. ■\n']</pre>
