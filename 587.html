        <pre>['“The failure of both the United States and Turkey to recognize and reconcile their\ndivergent strategic interests in Iraq is to blame for much of the deterioration \nin relations.”\nFrom Desert Storm to Metal Storm:\nHow Iraq Has Spoiled US-Turkish Relations\nJAMES E. KAPSIS\nUnited States troops open fire on Turkish\nSpecial Forces in northern Iraq. Full-scale\nwar breaks out between the two NATO\nallies. The United States launches an air assault\ndestroying Ankara and Istanbul. American forces\nroll into Anatolia. Turkey is on the verge of defeat.\nA Turkish agent sent to the United States sneaks\ntwo briefcases armed with nuclear devices into\nWashington, DC. One bomb detonates, annihilating\nthe capital and saving the Turkish republic\nfrom the American imperialist.\nThis macabre fantasy is the subject of Metal\nStorm, one of the fastest-selling novels in Turkey, a\ncountry where 82 percent of the public believes that\nthe United States, led by President George W. Bush,\nis a threat to world peace. Coupled with the pervasiveness\nof anti-American conspiracy theories in the\nTurkish mass media—ranging from accusations that\nthe US military committed genocide in Falluja to\nsuggestions that the Bush administration cooked up\nthe South Asian tsunami—these popular trends in\nTurkey have set off alarm bells in Washington. \nAlthough some critics in the United States have\nblamed the Turkish media and government for\nfeeding the current anti-Americanism, US policy\nmakers would be wrong to exaggerate the significance\nof Metal Storm or the Turkish appetite for\nconspiracy theories. However, they should try to\nrecognize these disturbing developments in Turkey\nfor what they are: symptoms of a deeper problem\nin US-Turkish relations.\nIt is no secret in Washington or Ankara that the\nUS-Turkish relationship suffered a serious blow\nwhen the Turkish parliament voted on March 1,\n2003, against giving the Bush administration access\nto a northern front in its war against Iraq. What\nshould trouble policy makers in both capitals is that\ntwo and a half years later relations are not getting\nbetter. They are getting worse. \nINSULTS AND INSTABILITY\nOutgoing US Ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman,\nwho could never seem to do anything to\nplease the Turks, left Ankara on rocky terms this\nsummer after apparently suggesting a few months\nearlier that Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer\ncancel a planned visit to Syria after the assassination\nof former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik\nHariri. The Turkish government and press accused\nthe United States of meddling in Turkish affairs.\nIn April of 2004, then-Secretary of State Colin\nPowell, well known for his discretion, ignited a\nsmall firestorm when he referred to Turkey in a\nspeech as a model “Islamic republic.” Most Turks\nview the adjective “Islamic” as a pejorative that\ndescribes fundamentalist regimes in Iran and the\nArab world, not their Westward-looking secular\nrepublic. Although Powell’s word choice was unfortunate—even\nreligious Turks are generally secular-\nists when it comes to the division of mosque and\nstate—the reaction in Turkey seemed disproportionate\nto the semantic mistake.\nIn more recent months, there have been attempts\nto improve the faltering relationship, but they have\nyielded little if any progress. Turkish Prime Minister\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan visited the White House\nin June to meet with President Bush, their first\nmeeting since he assured Bush in December 2002\nthat he would be able to deliver a northern front\nagainst Iraq to the Americans. Despite high expectations\nin Ankara and the Turkish press, Bush’s\nreception of Erdogan was noticeably cool. \n380\nJAMES E. KAPSIS, a former congressional aide, is a graduate student\nat the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. He\nworked earlier this year for the US State Department in Istanbul.\n', 'The strained relations between the United States\nand Turkey are having real effects on both countries’\nstrategic interests. Earlier this year, Ankara resisted\nUS requests for greater use of the Incirlik airbase for\nmissions in Afghanistan and Iraq (though Ankara\neventually relented). The Turks reportedly were\nworried that the United States might use the base\nto launch attacks against Syria and Iran. Ankara has\nalso continued to rebuff Washington’s request to\nhelp it isolate the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria,\nwhich the United States believes is supporting terrorism\nin both Lebanon and Iraq.\nMeanwhile, the US administration has frustrated\nTurkey by not taking military action against the\nKurdish Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist\nguerrilla group based in northern Iraq that has\nspent the spring and summer crossing the Turkish\nborder attacking Turkish military units and setting\noff bombs in Turkey’s lucrative tourist areas. These\nattacks have alarmed Ankara, which is desperately\ntrying to attract foreign investment, maintain a\nnewly stable economy, and continue down a path\nto European Union (EU) membership. The PKK’s\nreemerging terrorist threat could undermine each\nof these goals.\nIf the United States and Turkey do not take real\nsteps to improve their relations, both countries’\ninterests in Iraq will suffer. The Turks need the\nAmericans to help them defeat the PKK and to\nensure that whatever Kurdish entity emerges in\nnorthern Iraq poses no threat to Turkey’s territorial\nintegrity. For Washington, the tensions with Turkey\nfurther complicate its goals to maintain peace and\nstability in northern Iraq and to isolate Syria. \nTHE FALLING-OUT\nTurks fought and died alongside American soldiers\nin the Korean War. More recently, Turkey was\nthe cornerstone of US policy to contain Saddam\nHussein’s Iraq from Operation Desert Storm in\n1990 until Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Turks\nand Americans have worked together as North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners in\nKosovo and Afghanistan. Consecutive US presidents\nhave promoted Turkey globally as an exam-\nple of the compatibility between Islam and\ndemocracy. The United States has been the world’s\nnumber one advocate of Turkey’s membership in\nthe EU and has worked closely with Turkey against\nthe PKK, even delivering PKK leader Abdullah\nOcalan to Ankara in 1999. Later that same year, the\nTurkish public cheered wildly when President Bill\nClinton arrived in Istanbul to console Turkish\nearthquake victims and kiss babies. What happened\nto the strong US-Turkish relationship?\nThe failure of both the United States and Turkey\nto recognize and reconcile their divergent strategic\ninterests in Iraq is to blame for much of the deterioration\nin relations. For the past 20 years, Turkey’s\nprimary interest in Iraq has consistently been to\nprotect the integrity of its border and to eliminate\nPKK separatists, who have used the mountains of\nnorthern Iraq as a base for attacking Turkish targets.\nWhile Ankara never liked Hussein, both Turkey and\nthe Iraqi president saw the Kurds as a common\nthreat and worked together when it was in their\nmutual interest.\nAmerica’s primary concern in Iraq until March\n2003 was to contain Hussein’s regional power and\nprevent his regime from acquiring weapons of mass\ndestruction with which he could threaten his neighbors\nand destabilize oil markets. While the United\nStates viewed the PKK as a terrorist group, it certainly\nnever regarded the PKK as a threat greater\nthan the Iraqi regime. And unlike Ankara, which\nhas generally seen all Kurds in northern Iraq as a\nthreat to its interests, Washington has distinguished\nbetween the PKK and Iraqi Kurdish political factions,\nwhich it viewed as allies against Hussein.\nAfter the Gulf War and throughout the 1990s, the\nUnited States and Turkey were able to manage these\ndifferences. However, the attacks of September 11,\n2001, transformed the strategic landscape in Iraq.\nWhen the Bush administration decided to go to war\nwith Iraq in 2003, neither the Americans nor the\nTurks fully appreciated the extent to which a war\nand occupation could put their interests at odds. \nA failure of strategic imagination led both governments\nto mismanage their bilateral relationship\nin the run-up to the invasion of Iraq and in its aftermath.\nFirst, Washington miscalculated by asking a\ndivided and inexperienced new government in\nTurkey for access to a northern front that, it turns\nout, the United States did not need. The Turkish\ngovernment and military exacerbated this mistake\nby giving Washington the impression that they supported\nthe request and would ensure that it passed\nthe Turkish parliament. Second, Turkey’s pursuit of\ncovert military operations in northern Iraq and its\nfailure to inform its American allies of its activities\nhave led to several unfortunate incidents between\nTurkish and US military personnel that have soured\nhistorically strong military relations. Although not\nan excuse for Turkish clandestine activity, better US\nmilitary planning in the north and more coordination\nbetween the US military’s two command struc-\nHow Iraq Has Spoiled US-Turkish Relations • 381\n', 'tures in the region might have prevented or at least\nbetter managed the problem. \nWith the future of Iraqi democracy still in doubt\nand with continued instability in the Middle East\nand Central Asia, neither the United States nor\nTurkey can afford any further strain to their relationship.\nIt is in their mutual interest to put the\npieces back together. In large part, this will require\ncritical self-examination by both sides. \nTHE TROUBLE WITH IRAQ\nUS policy toward Iraq has been the unsteady axis\naround which US-Turkish relations have spun from\nOperation Desert Storm to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nThe problem is that for many Washington observers\nwithout an intimate understanding of Turkey, the\nrelationship has seemed just fine. At least as far back\nas the Gulf War, Turkey has appeared to be an\nunquestioning ally. In 1991, US Ambassador to\nTurkey Morton Abramowitz telephoned Turkish\nPresident Turgut Özal in\nthe middle of the night to\nask him whether Turkey\nwould open its airbases\nto American forces as the\nUnited States prepared to\nlaunch Desert Storm.\nWithin days the Turkish\nparliament passed a bill granting the United States\nthe access it requested.\nThroughout the 1990s, Turkey allowed the\nUnited States to use Incirlik airbase, first to conduct\nOperation Provide Comfort, a humanitarian mission\nfor Iraqi Kurdish refugees of Operation Desert\nStorm, and then to run Operation Northern Watch,\nthe subsequent US patrol of the no-fly zone in\nnorthern Iraq. Every six months for more than a\ndecade, the Turkish parliament, like a good ally,\nvoted to reauthorize US access to Turkish bases. \nBeneath the surface, however, Turks have consistently\nresisted US policies toward Iraq. President\nÖzal had pushed for base access against the wishes\nof his military and several members of his cabinet.\nThe Turkish military’s chief of staff even resigned\nin protest at the time. Throughout the 1990s,\nAmerican use of Incirlik to patrol the no-fly zone\nin Iraq was also unpopular among many of\nTurkey’s military and political leaders. Votes to\nrenew US access to Turkish bases did not come\nwithout serious prodding from the ruling government.\nMoreover, Ankara refused to allow the\nUnited States to launch offensive air strikes against\nBaghdad from Incirlik, including during a 1996 crisis\nover Iraqi operations in the north and during\nOperation Desert Fox. \nAccording to interviews earlier this year with\nTurkish officials both in Washington and Turkey,\nthe perception in Turkey was that the United States\nwas pushing the Turks for too much and that it was\ntaking Ankara’s loyalty for granted. The Turkish\nmilitary was especially troubled. As one Turkish\nofficial told me: “There were many distasteful\nevents between Turks and Americans in northern\nIraq, involving the Kurds and CIA. The United States\nwanted to fly more aircraft. They wanted a freer\nhand to enforce the no-fly zone.” \nInsiders at the Pentagon, such as retired Army\nCaptain Jay Wilkins, the former Turkey desk officer\nat the office of secretary of defense, noticed the tension.\n“I was amazed [by] the restrictions that the\nTurks placed on us,” he recalled. “In Operation\nNorthern Watch, the decision whether each flight\ngoes was a Turkish decision. The Turkish mindset is\nwe don’t want the Americans\ncoming over and\ngetting us in trouble in\nthe region. They’re not\ngoing to be here when\nwe need them.”\nTurkish concern with\nUS policy in Iraq has its\ndeepest roots in the Kurdish separatist movement\nthat followed the 1991 Gulf War. After the war\nnearly 500,000 Iraqi Kurds fled into southeastern\nTurkey, causing a refugee crisis that eventually\nescalated into a bloody insurgency. Many of the\nIraqi Kurds joined the PKK, an organization prepared\nto use terrorist means in pursuit of its ulti-\nmate goal: the establishment of a Kurdish\nnation-state. The insurgency took an estimated\n30,000 lives, including Turkish soldiers, PKK fighters,\nand Kurdish civilians. Turkish military officers\nview it as their “Vietnam.”\nThe economic effects of the war also were severe\nfor Turkey, which had been a major trading partner\nwith Iraq throughout the 1980s. Turkey’s southeastern\nregion, which became the hotbed of PKK insur-\ngency, was economically devastated. The United\nStates promised to provide robust assistance to\nTurkey, but the Turks never felt that they received\nenough aid to compensate them for their losses.\nTurkey did receive an estimated $8 billion in arms\nfrom the United States and Germany and more than\n$100 million in increased aid in 1991. Washington\nwas also instrumental in securing International\nMonetary Fund loans for Turkey, pushed hard in\n382 • CURRENT HISTORY • November 2005\nThe strained relations between the United\nStates and Turkey are having real effects\non both countries’ strategic interests.\n', 'Brussels for Turkey’s EU candidacy, and looked the\nother way when Turkey broke United Nations sanctions\nand traded with Iraq throughout the 1990s.\nFor the Turks, however, these were no substitute for\ndirect US economic assistance. It was within this\ntense and uncomfortable environment that the\nUnited States asked Turkey for access to its bases for\nOperation Iraqi Freedom. \nAMERICA’S MISTAKE\nWhen US Vice President Dick Cheney made a\ntrip to Ankara in March of 2002, he initiated a complex\nprocess of discussions and negotiations about\nhow Turkey might assist the United States if it went\nto war with Iraq. This process entered high gear in\nJuly 2002 when Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul\nWolfowitz made his own trip to the Turkish capital\nto articulate formally the American request for\naccess to Turkey’s military bases.\nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Army\nGeneral Tommy Franks told President Bush that the\nnorthern front was a necessary part of their war\nplan. However, the United States had never before\nasked Turkey to allow the deployment of US troops\non its soil to launch an invasion. The Pentagon\nrequest would be raising the bar in the relationship\nand putting considerable pressure on Ankara. Was\nthe United States asking too much of its ally?\nSecretary of State Powell thought so and\nexpressed strong reservations. After decades of\nworking with the Turks through NATO and from his\nexperience during the Gulf War, Powell likely\nunderstood the kind of pressure such a request\nwould place on Turkey. \n“I think [the Turks] can handle the overflights,”\nPowell told the National Security Council, according\nto an account by Bob Woodward in his book\nPlan of Attack. “I think they can handle the\nthrough-put. I think they can handle the air piece.\nIt’s when you talk about moving an armored division\nor mechanized division overland through the\nlength of Anatolia with a long huge train behind it,\nhuge numbers of vehicles, going to invade another\nMuslim country. I will go for that, but that may well\nbe one too many bricks on the scale for the Turks.\nI don’t think we can get it and we’re taking a risk at\nlosing it all by going for that.” \nDramatic political changes after the November\n2002 Turkish elections reinforced Powell’s argument.\nMembers of the newly elected Justice and\nDevelopment Party (AK), which had populist,\nIslamist roots, were ambivalent about allowing the\nAmericans to wage war from Turkish soil against a\nMuslim neighbor. The request was especially\nuncomfortable for the AK since much of its base of\nsupport came from rural, southeastern Turkey,\nwhich had been economically devastated by the\nfirst Gulf War and the PKK insurgency that followed.\nFurthermore, many of the AK’s leaders had little\nor no experience in parliamentary politics. AK, the\nTurkish acronym for the party, means white or pure\nin Turkish, but from an American perspective it\nmight have been better translated as “green.” Its\nmembers were new to the business of politics and\nit showed in the months and weeks leading up to\nthe parliamentary vote. The Bush administration,\nwhich had strong relations with the AK’s more\naccommodating predecessors, moved ahead with its\nrequest as if nothing had changed. \nThe US administration’s failure to appreciate the\npolitical situation in Turkey was evident in its diplomatic\nstrategy. Although Wolfowitz and Undersec-\nretary of State Marc Grossman made several trips to\nAnkara to meet personally with Turkish officials,\nthe negotiations never rose above the deputy secretary\nlevel. This was in stark contrast to the lead-up\nto the Gulf War, when Secretary of State James\nBaker reportedly visited Ankara three times. \nTHE PARLIAMENT BALKS\nOn March 1, 2003, the Turkish Grand National\nAssembly voted 264 to 251 on a measure that\nwould have authorized as many as 62,000 American\ntroops from the 4th Infantry Division to stage\nan invasion of Iraq from Turkish soil. Under Turkish\nparliamentary rules, however, a majority of leg-\nislators present in the chamber needed to vote yes\nfor the measure to pass, and there were 19 abstentions.\nThe abstentions meant the bill went down in\ndefeat. The result shocked and embarrassed Erdogan,\nthe leader of the AK, who had assured the\nUnited States that he could deliver a positive vote\nin the parliament.\nIt also surprised and angered many in the Pentagon,\nincluding Wolfowitz. Only a few months ear-\nlier, during a December trip to Ankara, he had\nseemed to think Turkish approval was locked up,\ndeclaring at a press conference that “Turkey has\nbeen with us always in the past and will be with us\nnow. Turkey’s support is assured.” Suddenly, the US\nmilitary, which had ships with supplies and materiel\nwaiting for weeks off Turkey’s Mediterranean coast,\nwould have to reconfigure its war plans only weeks\nbefore the planned invasion of Iraq.\nMany officials in the Defense and the State\nDepartments believe that the AK’s mismanagement\nHow Iraq Has Spoiled US-Turkish Relations • 383\n', 'of the parliamentary vote and the Turkish military’s\nalleged silence led to the “no” decision. Although\nthe AK did mismanage the vote (if the legislators\nwho abstained had simply left the chamber and not\nvoted the measure would have passed), and the military\nsent mixed signals about the US request (at a\nNational Security Council meeting the night before\nthe vote AK leaders asked the military to issue a\nstatement in support of the request but its leaders\ndeclined), with such a small margin in the tally any\nof a dozen factors could have changed the result.\nRather than asking why the vote failed, policy makers\nin Washington should be asking whether they\nshould have asked the Turks for a northern front in\nthe first place. \nAN UNNECESSARY FRONT\nWhen Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld hit the\nSunday morning talk shows on the second anniversary\nof the US invasion of Iraq to answer questions\nabout the resilience of the Iraqi insurgency, he\npointed a finger at Turkey. “Given the level of the\ninsurgency today, two years\nlater, clearly, if we had been\nable to get the 4th Infantry\nDivision in from the north\nthrough Turkey, more of\nthe Iraqi Saddam Hussein\nBaathist regime would have\nbeen captured or killed,’’ he\nsaid on Fox News Sunday. “The insurgency today\nwould have been less.” For Rumsfeld, an insufficient\nnumber of troops, a poor postwar plan, and\nthe decision to dissolve the entire Iraqi army were\nnot to blame for the resilience of the Iraqi insurgency,\nas many administration critics have sug-\ngested. It was Turkey’s fault.\nYet Rumsfeld’s own planners at the Pentagon\nnever put a high military value on a northern front.\nInterviews with Pentagon officials and General\nTommy Franks’ own book, American Soldier, suggest\nthat, while US military planners would have preferred\na northern front, they did not believe they needed it.\nFranks recalled a visit he had in November 2002\nwith the Turkish military’s chief of staff, Hilmi\nÖzkök, who told him that he could not guarantee\nthat the new Turkish government would approve the\nUS request. In his account, Franks appeared to downplay\nthe significance of Turkish approval. “Whatever\nits new government decided, I was optimistic that\nTurkey would continue to grant the Coalition basing\nfor U-2 reconnaissance flights over Iraq, as well as\ncombat aircraft operations out of Incirlik Air Base.\nAnd I remained hopeful that Turkey would also allow\nCoalition SOF [Special Operations Forces] to stage\nfrom its territory, provided their operations were not\nmade public, even if we were not permitted to stage a\nlarge conventional force there.”\nAlthough it is possible that General Franks\nrevised his recollections to put a brighter spin on\nhis war planning, additional evidence suggests the\nUnited States did not need a northern front.\nAccording to Lieutenant Colonel John Agoglia, who\nserved as Franks’ chief war planner in Iraq and was\npart of the US military’s negotiating team in Turkey,\na northern front was never a necessary part of the\nwar plan. “Did we need the Turks to execute the\noperation? No,” Agoglia told me in a telephone\ninterview. “Would their support have potentially\nfacilitated better conditions for the postconflict\nphase because of the pressure it would put on the\nnorth, and the potential to get units to capitulate?\nWe thought there would have been potential.” \nHussein had 12 divisions deployed along the\nGreen Line with the Kurdish autonomous areas in\nthe north. Both Agoglia and\nFranks wanted to give them\nreason to stay there once\nthe war began. Initially, they\nsaw the northern front as a\ndeception tactic to distract\nIraq’s forces from the main\nsource of the invasion,\nwhich would come from the south. “It began with\ndeception and became a helpful idea,” said Agoglia.\nIn fact, the Iraqi units in the north disbanded immediately\nafter the initial invasion despite the absence\nof the 4th Infantry Division. \nThe experience of Lieutenant General Pete\nOsman of the US Marine Corps, who was serving as\na coordination and liaison agent among the various\nfactions in northern Iraq (Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians,\nTurkomen, and other tribes) as well as between\nEUCOM (European Command) and CENTCOM (Central\nCommand) in northern Iraq before and during\nthe war, corroborates Agoglia’s claim. “CENTCOM\nwas primarily focused on the southern region, getting\nto Baghdad, isolating the city, and effecting a\nregime change,” Osman recalled. “They would\nmore fully address northern Iraq after securing\nBaghdad. Activities in the north were pretty much\nrestricted to special operations.”\nIn short, the US request for access to a northern\nfront was founded on a preference, not a necessity.\nThe Pentagon’s military planners wanted the access,\nbut they knew they could get the job done without\n384 • CURRENT HISTORY • November 2005\nThe image of US soldiers humiliating\nTurkish troops has become seared in\nthe imagination of the Turkish public.\n', 'it. The Americans already had Special Forces and CIA\noperatives in northern Iraq, courtesy of the Turks.\nAnd, although the Turkish parliament rejected the\nUS request for a northern front, it did quickly\napprove US military overflight rights. Finally, despite\nSecretary Rumsfeld’s suggestion to the contrary, Pentagon\nplanners did not predict nor were they wor-\nried about the effect of the 4th Infantry on a possible\ninsurgency. In fact, some Defense and State Department\nofficials believe in retrospect that it is better\nthat the Turks did not let American troops through\nthe north since they would have been accompanied\nby Turkish forces. Turkish troops stationed in large\nnumbers in Iraqi Kurdistan might have caused significant\nunrest and violence between Kurds and\nTurks, which would have destabilized what has been\none of Iraq’s most stable regions. \nWhile one can hardly fault war planners for asking\nthe White House to help secure a northern front\nthat they thought would be an asset, Bush administration\nofficials should have known better than to\nask for it. Given Turkey’s demonstrated resistance\nto US policy in Iraq and its new unpredictable political\nenvironment, it was the wrong request at the\nwrong time. Rather than negotiating for a necessary\npart of the US war plan, Cheney, Wolfowitz, and\ncompany pushed the US-Turkish relationship to the\nbrink for a “helpful idea.” \nMEMO OF MISUNDERSTANDING\nThe Turkish parliament’s rejection of America’s\nrequest to allow the 4th Infantry Division to march\nthrough Turkey had serious consequences for Turkish\nmilitary interests in northern Iraq. While Turk-\nish military leaders opposed the war, they\nultimately capitulated to American demands for\nsupport (the parliament’s subsequent rejection of\nthe infantry plan notwithstanding) because they\nunderstood that if the Americans went into Iraq\nwithout Turkey, the Turks would lose an opportunity\nto protect their interests in northern Iraq. \nIn the lead-up to the war, the Turkish military\nhad negotiated vigorously for a memorandum of\nunderstanding with the United States that would\ngive Turkey certain freedom of action in northern\nIraq. Although the details are classified, several\npress reports have leaked that the agreement would\nhave afforded the Turkish military the right to\nestablish a buffer zone in northern Iraq to limit the\npassage of Kurdish refugees into southern Turkey.\nIt also would have given Turkey the right to send its\nforces to the Iraqi cities of Kirkuk or Mosul in the\nevent of fighting between Kurdish and Turkomen\nfactions there or if the Kurds made any attempt to\nchange the demographic status quo.\nTurkey was very concerned that the Kurds would\ntake control of oil reserves in Kirkuk and Mosul,\nwhich could give them the financial base to pursue\nstatehood and to support Kurdish separatist elements\nin southeastern Turkey. The presence of\nTurkomen—ethnic Turks who have lived in the area\nsince Ottoman times—in Kirkuk and elsewhere\ngave Ankara an additional human rights argument\nfor a Turkish presence.\nFor Ankara, however, the Turkomen were more\nof an agenda item and a tool for drumming up\ndomestic popular support than a legitimate interest.\nAnkara did not seem to mind much when Hus-\nsein’s regime mistreated Turkomen. Yet, after the\nTurkish parliament voted no, all of Turkey’s concerns\nin northern Iraq were put in jeopardy. The\nmemorandum of understanding never went into\neffect, and Turkey lost much of its leverage over\npostwar policy in Iraq. \n“One of the things that was very difficult after\nthe vote was the Turks were very nervous in northern\nIraq and we were very tough with them about\nhow many troops they had inside,” Ambassador\nBeth Jones, then the assistant secretary of state for\nEuropean and Eurasia affairs, recalled in an interview.\n“The bottom line was that we had a tough\ntime military to military in Iraq.”\nAs a few serious incidents in the spring and summer\nof 2003 seem to corroborate, without the mem-\norandum of understanding in effect, the Turkish\nmilitary did not trust the Americans to serve as reliable\nproxies of Turkish interests. Turkey did not\ntrust the Americans to prevent the emergence of a\nKurdish state, to block potentially hundreds of\nthousands of Kurdish refugees from pouring into\nsoutheastern Turkey, to subdue the PKK, or to protect\nthe Iraqi Turkomen population from possible\nKurdish aggression. A lack of adequate American\nmilitary planning and coordination on the ground\nin northern Iraq would make matters even worse.\nTHE TURKISH “AID” CONVOY\nThe first manifestation of Turkish mistrust\noccurred on April 23, 2003, when American soldiers\nstopped a Turkish aid convoy at a checkpoint\nnorth of Kirkuk. Instead of aid workers, the Americans\nfound a half-dozen civilian-clothed Turkish\nSpecial Forces soldiers armed with rifles, grenades,\nand night-vision goggles who were trying to make\ntheir way into Kirkuk. They were planning to\ndeliver weapons to the Iraqi Turkomen.\nHow Iraq Has Spoiled US-Turkish Relations • 385\n', 'According to American officers of the 173rd and\n101st airborne divisions, which shared responsibility\nfor the Kurdish provinces of northern Iraq, the\nTurks had not informed them of their “other” activities.\nSince the mission of the American comman-\nders in the region was to provide security and\npromote cooperation among the Arab, Kurdish, and\nTurkomen populations, they viewed these clandestine\noperations as a threat. Turkish mistrust of the\nAmericans led to American mistrust of the Turks. \nThe irony is that US and Turkish military forces\nwere ostensibly working together. Despite the parliament’s\ndecision, Turkish Special Forces had liai-\nson units stationed at American bases. According to\nMajor William Ostlund, who was an operations\nofficer for the 173rd airborne in Kirkuk, the Turks\nhad their own operations center at Kirkuk airfield.\nWhen the Turks wanted to run patrols, they would\ntell the American operations center, which would\nthen send an officer along with them.\nBetween June and September 2003, according to\na memo written by Ostlund to his brigade commander,\nhis brigade alone conducted 39 joint\npatrols with Turkish Special Forces in Kirkuk, Tuz,\nTaza, and Daquq. They worked together successfully\nto resolve a dispute between Kurds and\nTurkomen in Tuz over a destroyed Turkish shrine\nand supervised security for an election involving\nthe Iraq Turkomen Front (ITF). (The ITF represents\na faction of Iraqi Turkomen with strong ties to\nAnkara.) Major Ike Wilson, who was chief of planning\nfor the 101st airborne from July 2003 until\nFebruary 2004, confirms that there was also a small\nTurkish liaison team based in the American operations\ncenter in Mosul. Officially, the Turks and\nAmericans were operating jointly. In reality, the\nTurks were pursuing their own agenda.\nAfter the 173rd stopped the Turkish “aid” convoy\non April 23, its commander, Colonel William\nMayville, contacted General Osman, who was leading\na joint task force in northern Iraq that was coor-\ndinating activities between EUCOM and CENTCOM.\nTurkey sits on what the military refers to as a “seam”\nbetween two military commands: EUCOM, which is\nbased in Germany, and CENTCOM, which has its forward\nheadquarters in Qatar. Since Turkey is part of\nNATO and since Ankara is very sensitive about being\nlabeled anything but European, Turkey remains in\nEUCOM even though most of its neighborhood—Iraq,\nSyria, and Iran—falls within CENTCOM’s area of\nresponsibility. General John Abizaid, who was then\ndeputy combatant commander at CENTCOM, was\nworried about stability in northern Iraq and wanted\nsomeone to be his eyes and ears in the region. He\nhad given Osman the daunting job of keeping the\nvarious factions in the north—Kurdish, Turkomen,\nArab, and Assyrian—from going to war with one\nanother and possibly drawing Turkey into a northern\nIraq war. “We don’t need a war within a war,”\nOsman recalled Abizaid telling him.\nWhen Colonel Mayville called Osman about the\nencounter with the armed Turkish aid envoy,\nOsman contacted Abizaid, who ordered them to\nescort the civilian-clothed Turkish officers back to\nthe border. Abizaid chose not to make an issue over\nthe incident. Mayville complied but not before\nmaking some impolitic statements to the press that\ncaused a stir in Turkey. Speaking to Time magazine,\nhe accused the Turks of trying to create a pretense\nfor a large-scale Turkish military intervention.\n“They did not come here with a pure heart,”\nMayville reportedly said. “Their objective is to create\nan environment that can be used by Turkey to\nsend a large peacekeeping force into Kirkuk.”\nThe incident, followed by Mayville’s comments,\nbrought problems on the ground into the open and\nfurther deepened the US-Turkish rift. The Americans\nfelt that the Turks were systematically undermining\ntheir mission, while the Turks felt the Americans\nwere insensitive to their concerns over Kurdish separatist\naspirations.\nA BLOODBATH AVERTED\nTensions between US and Turkish military forces\nreached a crescendo on July 4, 2003. Acting on\nwhat they say was compelling intelligence that terrorists\nwere planning to assassinate the elected Kur-\ndish mayor of Kirkuk, members of the 173rd raided\nan ITF office in Al-Suleymaniyah where the suspects\nwere allegedly planning the operation. According\nto Major Ostlund, who helped plan and monitor\nthe raid, American forces found explosives inside\nthe ITF office. US forces detained or arrested everyone\ninside. When they returned to Kirkuk with the\ndetainees, their Turkish Special Forces liaisons were\nwaiting for them. They told the Americans they had\ndetained Turkish Special Forces officers and\ndemanded their release. \nFrom the perspective of US military personnel,\nthe Turks were again challenging American authority\nin the region and not being honest about their\nactivities. As with the April incident, said Ostlund,\nthe Turkish liaison team working with the 173rd in\nKirkuk “didn’t tell us anything about it.” US forces\narrested the Turkish officers. Although they eventually\nalerted the Coalition Provisional Authority in\n386 • CURRENT HISTORY • November 2005\n', 'Baghdad, they did not do so until after they had\nalready detained the Turks, who were released two\ndays later.\nGeneral Osman, whom Colonel Mayville had consulted\non April 23 before taking action against the\nTurkish aid convoy, was no longer in Iraq. CENTCOM\nterminated his joint task force in May and did not\nreplace it. Thus, when it came to managing tension\nbetween the US and Turkish militaries, there was no\none on the ground to help coordinate between commanders\nin the field and decision makers in Baghdad\nand Washington. When reports that US soldiers had\nhandcuffed and placed sacks over the heads of 11\nTurkish Special Forces officers made their way into\nthe Turkish and international press, American military\nforces found themselves in the middle of an\ninternational incident.\nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld, national security\nadviser Condoleezza Rice, and eventually Vice President\nCheney stepped in\nto mollify the incensed\nTurkish government.\nAlthough Turkish military\nforces were operat-\ning without consulting\nUS commanders, the\nAmericans looked like\nthe bad guys. Rather\nthan dealing with the incident quietly, they had\ndecided to make an example of the Turks. In the\nwords of one senior American diplomat, the incident\nfell into the “Oh My God” category. Neither\nWashington nor Ankara was happy. They immediately\nlaunched a joint US-Turkish investigation into\nwhat happened. \nWhile much of the public blame fell on the\nAmericans, none of the American officers involved\nwas reprimanded or relocated. By summer’s end,\nhowever, Ankara had quietly relocated the commander\nof Turkish Special Forces in northern Iraq\nand his deputy. They had allegedly ordered the\nKirkuk operation without consulting their superiors.\nThe commander was retired early a year later;\nhis superior on the Turkish general staff resigned\nafter his promotion was delayed.\nAlthough the Turkish military should have\nshared much of the blame for the Al-Suleymaniyah\nincident, the image of US soldiers humiliating Turkish\ntroops has become seared in the imagination of\nthe Turkish public and, more important, in the\nranks of the Turkish military. While American military\nofficials viewed the March 1, 2003, vote as a\nTurkish stab in the back, for Turkish soldiers AlSuleymaniyah\nhas taken on an almost mythological\nquality. It has reinforced a Turkish suspicion dating\nto the end of World War I that Turkey has no real\nfriends in the West, not even the United States.\nREBUILDING THE RELATIONSHIP\nIraq remains the elephant in the room in USTurkish\nrelations. If the United States and Turkey\nare to repair their relationship, they will have to\nstart by better managing their competing interests\nin Iraq. Both sides must also learn to appreciate the\nlegitimate concerns of the other and find a policy\nformula that addresses their most pressing strategic\nneeds. \nThe United States and Turkey both have an interest\nin expelling the PKK from northern Iraq. How-\never, while the PKK is Turkey’s most pressing\nsecurity priority, the Americans place eliminating\nthe Iraqi insurgency, training Iraqi troops, and protecting\nan Iraqi consti-\ntutional compromise\nhigher on their to-do\nlist. The United States\nand Turkey must\nresolve this conflict in\nshort-term priorities.\nIn a poll earlier this\nyear, 75 percent of\nTurkish respondents cited the presence of the PKK\nin northern Iraq as the thorniest issue in TurkishAmerican\nrelations. Although it is impossible to\nknow their exact number, it is estimated that\naround 5,000 PKK militants are still based in the\nQandil Mountains on the border between northern\nIraq and Turkey. The PKK ended a unilateral ceasefire\nin September 2003 and has since escalated\nattacks against Turkey. \nThe State Department and Pentagon admit that\nthe United States has neglected to address the PKK\nissue. Officials at State have asked their Pentagon\ncounterparts to at least take limited action against\nthe PKK to send a positive signal to Turkey, but the\nmilitary has said it does not have the troops to carry\nout the job. According to Pentagon officials, they\nhave fully committed their personnel and resources\nto fighting the Iraqi insurgency. US military planners\nare understandably reluctant to provoke the PKK\nand add 5,000 more insurgents to their agenda.\nHowever, if the United States is going to rebuild\ntrust with the Turkish military and public, it must\nhelp Turkey address its PKK problem. \nIf the Americans are too preoccupied fighting\nIraqi insurgents on behalf of the Iraqi government,\nHow Iraq Has Spoiled US-Turkish Relations • 387\nWashington miscalculated by asking a\ndivided and inexperienced new government\nin Turkey for access to a northern front that,\nit turns out, the United States did not need.\n', 'they should ask the Iraqi government for help with\nthe PKK. Specifically, the United States should lean\non the leadership of the two major Kurdish political\norganizations, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan\n(PUK) and the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP). (The\nIraqi president, Jalal Talabani, is also the PUK leader.)\nIn the past, both the PUK and the KDP have\nallowed the Turkish military to cross the Iraqi border\nto take on PKK fighters; on occasion, their mili-\ntias have even taken military action against the PKK.\nHowever, both the PUK and the KDP currently tolerate\nthe PKK presence in their region to avoid vio-\nlent PKK reprisals. Their tolerance is unacceptable.\nIn the long run, it is in Iraqi Kurdish interests to\nexpel PKK terrorists, who extort and intimidate\nlocal villagers, engage in illegal smuggling, and\npose a direct threat to any Iraqi Kurdish claim to\nregional autonomy. Adopting a more assertive policy\nagainst the PKK would also mollify the Kurds’\nvery nervous and heavily\narmed Turkish neighbor. \nIraqi Kurdish authorities\nshould work with US\nforces in the region to\nbegin limiting the movement\nof PKK guerrillas,\narresting key PKK leaders,\nand shutting down PKKfront\npolitical offices. The Turkish government has\nprovided the United States with a list of PKK “most\nwanted,” but current US policy is to arrest them only\nif they happen to be stopped at a checkpoint. The\nUnited States and the Iraqi Kurds should take a\nmore aggressive approach. This means committing\nmore Kurdish militia to the understaffed Iraqi border\npolice, engaging PKK members who resist con-\ntainment, and seeking out intelligence on the\nwhereabouts of specific PKK leaders. In November\n2003, 11 border police were wounded and 1 was\nkilled in a PKK ambush, so for the Iraqis direct\nengagement is not without precedent. If resources\nand troops remain limited, the United States and\nthe Iraqis should consider working with Turkish\nSpecial Forces in the area. Although trust is low\namong these three groups, the best way to rebuild\nit is to work together to achieve a common goal.\nThe United States should also pressure Iraqi Kurdish\nleaders to shut down PKK-allied political par-\nties operating in their territory, including the\nKurdistan Democratic Solutions Party and the\nDemocratic Construction Party. These parties have\nbrashly flown PKK flags above their Iraqi offices.\nImages of these flags were broadcast on every television\nchannel in Turkey this summer, infuriating\nthe Turkish government and public. Closing these\noffices might cause some local political headaches\nfor the Iraqi Kurds, but it would help build trust\nbetween Ankara and the Iraqi Kurdish authorities.\nAlthough more aggressive military action against\nthe PKK would offer some tactical short-term benefit\nby disrupting PKK activities, its long-term strate-\ngic value is limited. In short, there is no military\nsolution to the PKK problem. As Turkish Prime Minister\nErdogan admitted during a recent trip to the\nmajority Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in southeastern\nTurkey, Turkey has a “Kurdish problem.” The\nanswer is not simply destroying terrorists, but\naddressing the real social, economic, and political\nneeds of Turkish Kurds living in southeastern\nTurkey and northern Iraq.\nTo date, Turkey has failed on all accounts. For\nexample, more than 10,000 Turkish Kurds, who fled\nTurkey during intense\nfighting between Turkish\nmilitary and PKK\nforces in the 1990s, still\nlive in a refugee camp\nwest of Mosul in Iraq.\nThey have yet to return\nhome because they are\nworried about possible\nTurkish reprisals and a lack of economic opportunity\nin southeastern Turkey. As a result, they are a\nmarginalized breeding ground for PKK recruits.\nFor its part, the United States needs to improve\nmanagement and coordination of operations in\nnorthern Iraq. The joint investigation after the July\n4, 2003, incident in Al-Suleymaniyah was a necessary\nstopgap measure, but it merely addressed the\nsymptoms of two fundamental structural problems.\nFirst, as the incidents in April and July suggest, US\nand Turkish forces were not coordinating their\nefforts in northern Iraq. Whether or not some\ninformation was flowing between commanders, it\nis clear that it was not trickling down to the operational\nand tactical levels where it really matters. Sec-\nond, there was a major lack of coordination\nbetween American troops on the ground and commanders\nat CENTCOM and EUCOM. Since northern\nIraq will remain a vulnerable aspect of US-Turkish\nrelations as long as US troops are in Iraq, there must\nbe better coordination and communication.\nBefore the war, the Pentagon considered making\nthe easternmost 100-mile strip along the Iraqi border\na joint CENTCOM-EUCOM responsibility, but the\nTurks resisted. They wanted to be wholly part of\n388 • CURRENT HISTORY • November 2005\nTurkey’s pursuit of covert military\noperations in northern Iraq and its failure\nto inform its American allies of its activities\nhave led to several unfortunate incidents.\n', 'EUCOM. Rather than fundamentally altering the US\ncommand structure, which would face severe political\nand logistical hurdles, the US military should\nestablish a permanent joint task force or liaison\noffice to manage the seam between CENTCOM and\nEUCOM that lies along the Turkish-Iraqi border.\nOsman’s joint task force in early 2003 was generally\nsuccessful at keeping a lid on tensions in northern\nIraq. It never should have been eliminated.\nRESTORING FAITH\nAlthough differences over Iraq have weakened\nUS-Turkish relations, the foundation of the relationship\nis by no means crumbling. The United\nStates advocated vigorously on behalf of Turkey to\nhelp secure a date from the EU to begin accession\nnegotiations. Washington also helped convince the\nAK leadership to fundamentally change Turkey’s policy\nover Cyprus from one of intransigence to coop-\neration. Turkey for its part continues to provide\nsignificant support to the US-led NATO operation in\nAfghanistan. In August the Turks completed their\nsecond six-month tour since the fall of the Taliban\nas head of NATO forces in Afghanistan. And even\nafter the war in Iraq, more students continue to\nflock to the United States from Turkey than from\nany other European country. Still, if Turkey and the\nUnited States allow their differences over Iraq to\ncontinue to fester, these other areas of cooperation\nmay soon suffer from negative spillover effects.\nThe central issue on which the US-Turkey relationship\nwill pivot is the status of the Kurds in north-\nern Iraq. Fortunately, serious dialogue has begun.\nThe first of a series of trilateral meetings among\nTurkish, Iraqi, and American security officials took\nplace in Washington in August. In September, highranking\nEUCOM and CENTCOM officials visited Ankara\nto meet with the Turkish general staff and discuss\nthe situation in northern Iraq. Although little\nprogress was reported at these meetings, talk is better\nthan silence. With winter rapidly approaching\nand PKK action likely to halt as snow makes traversing\nthe border nearly impossible, the United States\nand Turkey have an opportunity to make sure that\nwhen spring arrives they have a common strategy in\nplace to address the PKK threat. \nTurkey may not get the full-scale attack on PKK\npositions that it wants, and the Americans may\nhave to put more pressure on the Iraqi government\nthan they would like. But finding a middle way in\nthe short run is the only option if they care about\nrepairing relations. Over the long run, a stable,\ndemocratic Iraq is in the interests of both countries.\nThe Turks have begun reluctantly to accept the possibility\nof a federal Iraq with an autonomous Kur-\ndish region, but they remain nervous about the\nundecided status of Kirkuk and the potential for an\nindependent Kurdistan if the Iraqi democratic\nexperiment falls apart. The United States must\nmake sure that, while Turkey may not have a seat\nat the negotiating table, its interests in the future of\nIraq are not ignored. By actively and honestly\naddressing the challenge that Iraq poses to their\nrelationship, the United States and Turkey can avoid\nthe predictions of Metal Storm and restore faith in\ntheir 50-year strategic partnership. ■\nHow Iraq Has Spoiled US-Turkish Relations • 389\n']</pre>
