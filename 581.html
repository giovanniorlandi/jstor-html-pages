        <pre>['http://www.ve.org.za doi:10.4102/ve.v36i1.1483\nPage 1 of 7 Original Research\nThe problem\nOne of the most controversial prohibitions in the New Testament is found in 2 John 10–11 which \ncontains a direct imperative against receiving into one’s house a visitor (probably a travelling \npreacher1) who does not bring the teaching about Christ (v. 9) because this would imply cooperation\nwith such a person. The relevant text reads:\nIf anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him \nany greeting (μὴ λαμβάνετε αὐτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν καὶ χαίρειν αὐτῷ μὴ λέγετε), for whoever greets him takes part in \nhis wicked works (κοινωνεῖ τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ τοῖς πονηροῖς).\nApart from difficulties in determining who exactly these visitors were, the severity or even \nstrangeness of this command is noted by many (Brown 1986:692–693; Kelly 1905:404–405; \nPfeiffer & Harrison 1962:ad loc.; Plummer 1886:139; Smalley 1984:333; Strecker 1989:346). It, \nfor instance, creates tension with other Christian commandments like love and care (Jn 13:34; \n1 Jn 3:11; 4:7–21); it militates against the convention of ancient hospitality (Ac 16:15; Rm \n12:13; Heb 13:2) and seems to stand in opposition to the recommendation in 3 John (Lenski \n1966:569; Smalley 1984:334).\nThis resulted in a wide variety of responses stretching from a literal application to outright \nrejection of the prohibition (Akin 2001:233), speaking of the ‘un-Christian nature of such a \nteaching’ (Painter 2002:354). An interesting feature, that illustrates the partial influence of societal \nopinion on evaluating biblical content is that in the latter part of the 19th and earlier part of the \n20th century the inclination (though not absolute) was more to accept a literal interpretation and \napplication, while the opinion shifted in the middle of the 20th century to a more critical stance \nand even outright rejection of the prohibition (also not absolute).\nKelly (1905:405), for instance, takes a strong position, favouring the literal application of the \nprohibition for today:\nTo those who do not value Christ’s name and word it must seem outrageous, especially in these liberal \ndays, where man is all and Christ is little or nothing, and even professing Christians are so ready to say \nnothing about it. (cf. also Cocke 1895:148)\n1.Such travelling preachers were important in early Christian contexts: cf. Matthew 10:40; Mark 9:37; Romans 12:13; 1 Timothy 5:10; \nHebrews 13:2; 1 Peter 4:9; Matthew 10:11–14; cf. also Malherbe (1983:92–112).\nAuthor:\nJan van der Watt1,2\nAffiliations:\n1Source texts of Judaism \nand Christianity, Radboud \nUniversity Nijmegen, the \nNetherlands\n2Department of New \nTestament, University of the \nFree State, South Africa\nCorrespondence to:\nJan van der Watt\nEmail:\njanvanderwatt@kpnmail.nl\nPostal address:\n7 Paterserf, 6584 GA \nMolenhoek, the Netherlands\nDates:\nReceived: 27 May 2015\nAccepted: 09 Sept. 2015\nPublished: 30 Nov. 2015\nHow to cite this article:\nVan der Watt, J., 2015, ‘The \nethical implications of 2 John \n10–11’, Verbum et Ecclesia \n36(1), Art. #1483, 7 pages. \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4102/\nve.v36i1.1483\nCopyright:\n© 2015.

This raises the question what this prohibition is specifically about and whether \nhospitality is really asked for. This question is considered in some detail in this article. A \nwidely held view is that the prohibition in 2 John 10 is not in line with generally accepted \nChristian ethics, since it militates against the attitude of love, care, and hospitality. This view \nis dominant in commentaries. This article aims at countering this view by proposing that the \nissue is not hospitality but endangering the identity and tradition of the group. This should be \nregarded as a positive Christian value.\nIntradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: I challenge theological readings of \n2 John 10–11 that regard the text as unchristian in its exhortation. The results of the research \nshow that hospitality is not the communicative centre of the text, but protection of the group, \nwhich was a common feature, not only in Christianity, but also in the ancient world in general. \nThe future discourse should now move from focusing on moral issues related to hospitality to \nissues related to preserving tradition within a religion.\nRead online:\nScan this QR \ncode with your \nsmart phone or \nmobile device \nto read online.\n', 'Page 2 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.ve.org.za doi:10.4102/ve.v36i1.1483\nMore recently Hodges (1985:2908–2909) has argued that \nthe ‘modern inclination to be highly tolerant of religious \ndifferences’ creates a problem, since by doing so ‘this modern \nage … has lost its convictions about the truth’. False teachers \nwho actively partake in disseminating error should not be \nencouraged or helped at all.\nEvaluating this position, Brown (1986:692) notes that 2 John \n10 was used ‘for slamming doors in the face of’ door-to-door \nmissionaries like the Jehovah’s Witnesses, going back to the \nview that such biblical injunctions cannot be ignored. Brown \n(1986:693), for instance, quotes Alford saying that we are ‘not \nat liberty to set aside direct ethical injunctions of the Lord’s \nApostles’.\nA major figure like C.H. Dodd (1946:152) rejects the literal \napplication of this prohibition on situations today by \nsaying: ‘We may similarly decline to accept the Presbyter’s \nruling here as a sufficient guide to Christian conduct’, since, \naccording to him, it is not in line with what the rest of the \nNew Testament teaches. Brown (1986:693) sides with Dodd \nopining that this injunction cannot be applied directly to \ntoday’s situation: ‘Fierce exclusiveness, even in the name \nof truth, usually backfires on its practitioners’. According \nto Smith (s.a.:5293–5204) such behaviour could only lead to \nisolation and the inability to witness to others, apart from the \nfact that the prohibition is ‘unchristian council, contrary to \nthe spirit and teaching of the Lord’.\nBrown (1986:693) further opines that the problem is that in \nalmost every dispute in the church such claims are made and \nthat drastic actions are usually justified by claiming that it is \ndone for the sake of the truth.2 He then concludes: ‘Dodd’s \nquestion touches a real issue: “Does truth prevail the more \nif we are not on speaking terms with those whose view of \nthe truth differs from ours – however disastrous their error \nmay be?”’\nBetween these poles there are other voices, trying to solve \nthe problem by pointing to the unique situation. Because \nof the nature of this injunction the unique nature of the \nsituation is emphasised. Spence-Jones (1909:3) remarked at \nthe beginning of the previous century that ‘the apostle is \ngiving directions to a particular Christian household during \na particular crisis in the history of the Christian faith’ (cf. \nLenski 1966:569–571). Although he does not want to negate \nthe command, he emphasises that the differences with \ncurrent situations should be considered before applying the \ninjunction today. Lücke (1837:332–333) already reflected on \nthis in the first part of the 19th century and pointed out that \nJohn does not refuse hospitality to heathens or Jews, but to \nheretics who as Christians claimed a hospitable reception. \nAkin (2001:233) recently also opined that these verses are \n‘open to abuse and misunderstanding if removed from its \nimmediate context’, leading some to deem ‘it unloving and \nworthy of rejection’.\n2.Strecker (1989:346) reminds us that this is an inner-Christian conflict, since the false \nteachers were also carrying a message of Christ.\nBecause of these obvious tensions between the imperative in \n2 John 10–11 and some core Christian values like hospitality, \nlove or co-operation, modern commentators seriously reflect \non the implications of 2 John 10 for present-day contacts \nwith people of other mind than yourself, as is evident from \nthe above discussion. Does 2 John 10 suggest a ‘closed’ \nsituation where people who differ are not to be welcomed or \nconversed with, or should 2 John 10 for different reasons be \ninterpreted as not applicable to present-day situations? Or is \nthere perhaps a bigger principle behind the command that \nshould be taken seriously?\nSeveral questions beckon: (1) Although the remark is widely \ninterpreted within the framework of ancient hospitality \ncustoms, it is a question whether hospitality is the main \nissue here; whatever the scenario, the implications should \nbe considered. (2) If the issue is hospitality, is the issue \nhere private or public (group) hospitality, or is this a false \nquestion? (3) What is the relationship between love, greeting \nand the command in 2 John 10–11? and (4) What is the \nrelation between false teaching and social interaction?\nWhat if the visitors asked for \nhospitality?\nA contentious question is whether the prohibition in 2 John \n10 is against showing hospitality or not. The majority of \ncommentators assume this, although the view that this verse \ndoes not deal with hospitality is also defended. Both scenarios \nshould be considered. Let us start with the assumption that \nhospitality customs form the background of the events \nnarrated in 2 John 10–11.\nPainter (2002:354), like many others (cf. e.g. Bultmann \n1973:113–114; Kruse 2000:213–216; Watson 1989:106; Brown \n1986:650–651), opines that the instruction given here ‘is to be \nunderstood against the background of hospitality given to \nstrangers and travellers in the ancient world’. For this reason, \nin virtually every respectable commentary or article dealing \nwith these verses (or with 3 Jn), information is provided of \nwhat ancient hospitality entails. For our purposes a brief \noverview is also necessary, aimed at facilitating answers to \nour specific questions.\nThere is consensus that early Christians gathered in houses \nthat were also ordinary family dwellings, that is, house \nchurches (Rm 14–16; 1 Cor 1, 11; Col 4:15; cf. Malherbe \n1983:94–96; Smith s.a.:5203; Gehring 2004; Banks 2012). \nPersons sufficiently well off would serve as donors, making \ntheir dwellings available to the Christian gathering (cf. \nDiotrepehes and Gaius in 3 Jn, or the ‘elect Lady’ in 2 Jn; cf. \nalso Ac 18:1–3; Rm 16:3–5, 23; 1 Cor 16:19; Phlm 2–7). Christian \nhouse groups were thus formed, where (1) the ancient \ngroup-orientated practice of ‘friends of friends’ functioned, \naccording to which related groups were encouraged to \nwelcome one another’s members,3 and (2) the hospitality \n3.It is doubtful whether outsiders would make significant use of Christian hospitality \nduring the early times. Judging from Pliny’s letter to Trajan (110–114 CE) Christian \nmeetings were rather secretive. The other side of the coin is that there is some evidence \nthat people were apparently invited to (some of?) the meetings (1 Cor 14:16–25).\n', 'Page 3 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.ve.org.za doi:10.4102/ve.v36i1.1483\ncustoms of those days offered bases for boarding, lodging \nand further support for travellers, especially those who were \npart of the ‘friends of friends’ circle (Keener 1993:ad loc.; \nMalherbe 1983:102–103).\nIn this regard letters of recommendation played a central \nrole,4 as we see in 3 John (Brown 1986:689–690). Malina (1986) \ndescribes the implications of letters of recommendation by \nsaying:\nThe person writing a recommendation attests to the stranger \nbearing it on the basis of the world of honor of the attester. To \nreject the recommended stranger is, of course, a challenge to the \nhonor of the recommender. It spurns his honor, and requires an \nattempt at satisfaction on his part, under pain of being shamed. \n(p. 187; cf. also Kruse 2000:215–216)\nThis meant that in such house churches the social boundaries \nwere relatively porous (cf. Ac 20:20), although protected \nthrough the letters of recommendation. Hospitality also had \nthe function of creatively presupposing a potential network \nof possible related and associated groups. This nevertheless \nemphasises that hospitality as such was a deeply social \nand relational act that had implications for future social \ninteraction between those involved.\nConsidering the nature and impact of ancient hospitality \nconventions, Malina (1986:181) makes an important point: \n‘Hospitality might be defined as the process by means of \nwhich an outsider’s status is changed from stranger to \nguest.’ This happens by receiving the person into one’s home \nand extending to the person certain rights and privileges \nlinked to being part of that home and enjoying patronage \nfrom the host (Kruse 2000:213). Malina wants to restrict the \npractice of hospitality to outsiders who may be ‘friends of \nfriends’, that is, those who carry a letter of recommendation, \nwhich presumes some form of prior relationship, direct or \nindirect (cf also Ebrard 1860:393). He therefore distinguishes \nhospitality from other social practices like welcoming your \nown family or close friends into your house.\nMalina (1986) argues that once a person is allowed into the \nhouse different ‘stages’ of the process of hospitality should \nbe distinguished:\nThe process would have three stages to it: (1) evaluating the \nstranger (usually with some test about whether guest status is \npossible); (2) the stranger as guest – the liminal phase; (3) from \nguest to transformed stranger (at times with another test). (p. 182)\nAt the basis of these stages lay certain social expectations, \nboth of the host and the guest.5 Certain behaviour is expected, \nfor instance, that the host protects the guest and that the guest \n4.Brown (1986:690) speculates about the extent to which letters of recommendation \nwere used in a close-knit group like the Johannine group. \n5.It is expected of the guest to honour the practices, conventions and rules of the \nhost. A host acts improperly if he (1) insults his guest or treats him with some \nenmity or rivalry, (2) if he does not protect the guest, (3) if the host does not give \nthe required attention to his guest. A guest would break the rule and conventions if \nhe (1) insults or challenges the host, (2) if he takes over the role of the host by doing \nthings before he is invited, giving command or demanding things before it is offered \nor refusing what is offered, namely food (Malina 1986:185). \ndoes not dishonour or shame the host.6 The way these social \nexpectations are fulfilled determines whether a guest leaves \nas a friend or, possibly, as an enemy (Malina 1986:186), which \nwould obviously determine future relations.\nAnother important point Malina (1986:185) makes is that ‘[w]\nhile hospitality does not entail mutual reciprocity between \nindividuals, it can nevertheless be viewed as a reciprocal \nrelationship between communities. Such hospitality to \ntravelling Christians is both urged (see Rm 12:13; 1 Pt 4:9) \nand much practiced (e.g. Ac 17:7; 21:17; 28:7; Rm 16:23)’ (cf. \nalso Malherbe 1983:92–103). This means that foreign visitors, \nbeing part of their own communities therefore represent \nthese communities wherever they go. The visitors to the \n‘elect Lady’ (2 Jn 10–11) therefore represented a group that is \nsomehow related to the Lady’s group, or else they would not \nhave approached her, at least not for reasons of hospitality. \nBrown (1986:689) argues that these visitors could not have \nbeen ‘haphazard’ or even ‘general missionaries’ (cf. also \nSchnackenburg 1984:315–316; Ebrard 1860:393–395). They \nare part of a recent (Christological) development to which \nthe Johannine groups are somehow ‘related’ and should now \nbe warned against. Previously the ‘Lady’ perhaps offered \nhospitality without restriction since there was no such threat. \nNow the situation has changed and care should be taken as \nto whom she allows into her house.\nLooking at the evidence in 2 John 10 it is possible that these \npossible (Du Rand 1997:173) visitors could qualify for \nhospitality, especially since the phrase (εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρὸς \nὑμᾶς – εἴ plus the indicative) suggests an ‘open situation’ \nwith undetermined persons (τις) arriving. According to \nthe information about hospitality above, some sort of \nreciprocal relation between the visitors and the group of \nthe ‘elect Lady’ should be assumed.7 The fact that no letter \nof recommendation is mentioned in 2 John might imply that \nthese visitors were known to the ‘Lady’. If Malina’s view is \nvalid that hospitality should be restricted to strangers who \ncarry letters of recommendation, the case for hospitality is \nweakened.\nIf it is accepted that hospitality is at stake here, mainly two \npossibilities should be distinguished: (1) that it was a private \nhouse and that ‘private hospitality’ is prohibited or (2) that \nthe people approach a house church8 for congregational \nparticipation and that that form of ‘group hospitality’ is \nrefused (Elwell 1995:ad loc.; Smalley 1984:333). It is doubtful \nwhether these two options are exclusive of one another, since \nit seems logical that the ‘travelling visitor’ would need the \nhospitality of the house even after the meeting is finished. \nIf not, the group most probably would have accommodated \nhim or her in other ways. Malina (1986:185) indicates that \n6.Malina (1986:182–183) remarks: ‘To offend the protégé or client is to offend the \nprotector/patron. Thus the stranger is incorporated only through a personal bond \nwith an established community member.’\n7.Malina (1986:185–186), followed by Kruse (2000:215), explains that on the basis \nof reciprocity the group received will go back to their base group and report back, \ndetermining how the host group will be treated when they are visiting the other \ngroup. \n8.Cf. Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:19; Colossians 4:15; Philemon 2.\n', 'Page 4 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.ve.org.za doi:10.4102/ve.v36i1.1483\nvisitors appealing for hospitality normally represented a \ngroup and not just an individual. In any case, the meetings \nwere in a house where a host (the house owner) was in an \nauthoritative position to make the final decision (as is the \ncase with Diotrephes or even Gaius in 3 Jn). If these were \ntravelling missionaries, they would normally have stayed \nlonger than just the meeting and would have expected aid for \ntheir forward journey, which would involve the house owner \n(either in his capacity of private house owner or host to the \ngathering of Christians). Since the context also has religious \nundertones (these were false teachers) the idea of a purely \nprivate visit is not favoured.\nOffering hospitality to someone in ancient times therefore \ninvolved a complex of conventions based on various \nexpectations. The guest would receive protection, special \nstatus in the house, and could count on current and future \nsupport. In addition, acceptance would also indicate existing \nrelations (‘friends of friends’) which would socially typify \nthe host. It was therefore not a matter of a neutral ‘hallo’ and \nthen ‘goodbye’.\nWhat if hospitality conventions \nwere not called upon?\nThe above are broadly the situation in mind if hospitality \nconventions were called upon. As was mentioned earlier, \nthe possibility exists that hospitality conventions should not \nbe seen as the background to this situation. It is notable that \nin many cases it is simply assumed that hospitality should \nbe regarded as the framework of this prohibition, without \nproper motivation. Let us consider some arguments that \nmight suggest that hospitality conventions should not be the \nfocus of the argument here.\nTreatment of deviating people in ancient \ngatherings: An example\nThe second century document Inscriptiones Graecae II 1368 \n(dated around 178 CE) contains a minutes of a meeting of \nthe Society of Iobacchi in Attica with a copy of the revised \nstatutes (Ferguson 1990:108–110). Although the suggestion \nis by no means that there is a parallel or some link between \n2 John and these statutes, there are some interesting points \nmade in the statutes about the way in which the organisation \nand treatment of members were arranged. A few points will \nbe highlighted: (1) membership was a community concern – \nthey voted on possible candidature. (2) If fees were not paid, \na member would be ‘excluded from the gathering’ – they \nwould not be allowed in. (3) Order was important (even at a \nmeeting of the Bacchic society) – members were not allowed \nto sing or create disturbance, ‘but each shall say and act his \nallotted part with all good order and quietness under the \ndirection of the priest’. And further, ‘If anyone start to fight \nor be found acting disorderly or occupying the seat of any \nother member or using insulting or abusive language’, he \nwill be fined. If anyone ‘comes to blows’ he will be excluded \nfor a period. Even the officer who fails to eject the fighters \nwill be punished. Making a speech without permission was \na punishable offence. In the meetings an orderly officer also \ncarried a thyrsus. He could place the thyrus beside a person \nwho acts in a disorderly manner or who creates disturbance, \nindicating that such a person should leave the room. If the \nperson disobeys or refuses he is ‘put outside the front door’ \nand punished.9\nSeveral things should be noticed for our purposes. (1) \nExclusion or expulsion from the meeting was the basic \nway of ensuring the orderly continuation of the meeting. If \na person did not fit his role, he was put outside and even \npunished. (2) Discipline and order formed the basis of these \nmeetings. In these statutes a major theme is the protection \nof the group and its activities against disorder or disruption. \n(3) The group as such had power to decide who they want to \nbe a member and who should be excluded. Not hospitality \nconventions, but the power of the group’s view(s) was \ndominant. The interests of the group were placed above any \n‘individual rights’.\nIf this was commonly accepted as practice, which \nKloppenborg and Ascough (2011:55) seem to suggest,10 it \nhas a lot so say about the situation of 2 John 10–11. Again it \nshould be noted that the suggestion is not that the Bacchic \nsituation and that of 2 John are in any way related. There are \nhowever interesting parallels, for instance, the way in which \nthey protect their respective groups, inter alia by disallowing \na deviating person contact with the group, or the acceptance \nof commonly shared rules or traditions may serve as pointers \nin understanding 2 John. This attitude of discouraging and \nbreaking contact with deviating members is also confirmed \nin Christian documents. In Matthew 18:15–17 church \ndiscipline would involve exclusion of a person who did not \nalign himself with the group’s wishes. Paul makes the same \nsuggestion in 1 Corinthians 5:4–5 where he recommends that \na deviating person should be delivered to Satan. Titus 3:10 \nalso calls for the exclusion of a divisive man. In Didache 11:1–2 \nor Ignatius’ To the Smyrnaeans 4:1; 7:1 or 9:1 similar situations \nare envisaged.11 In light of what seems to be a common way \nof protecting the integrity of a group, exclusion or refusal to \nreceive such divisive people in 2 John is not exceptional.\n9.The above is only one example. Cf. also IG II 1275 (ca. beginning third century BCE) \nwhere the obligations of members of a thiasos are described. Accepting a law was \ndone by mutual consent and after the law came into effect, the group had the right \nto punish trespassers of that law in different ways, inter alia by excluding them from \nthe group (cf. the discussion by Kloppenborg & Ascough 2011:52–55). In a third \ncentury rabbinic document, t.Hullin 2:24 (for the text and discussion cf. Visotzky \n2005:102–104), an episode is narrated where a prominent rabbi, Rabbi Eliezer, was \narrested by the Romans for being a Christian. The judge found him not guilty, but \nit troubled the rabbi that he was regarded as a Christian. In response to a remark \nof Rabbi Akiba (i.e. ‘Perhaps one of the heretics/Christians spoke some heresy \nwhich pleased you?’) he realised that he transgressed by lending an ear to James \nof the village of Sikhnin who spoke about Christianity. By this he transgressed the \nwords of Torah in Proverbs 5:8 and 7:26 which demand that one should keep away \nfrom harm and danger. ‘Rabbi Eliezer used to say, “A person must always flee from \nthe hateful (ki’ur) and all that resembles the hateful”’. The attitude and practice \nof disassociating oneself from the danger presented by the ‘hateful’ is thus clearly \nattested within Jewish contexts also. Although this text most probably post-dates \nour situation, it represents an earlier attitude and consequent behaviour towards \nother-minded ‘opponents’. \n10.Kloppenborg and Ascough (2011:55) remark: ‘It is common to find the imposition \nof fines and sometimes even temporary or even permanent exclusion of members \nwho violate the rules of an association’. Cf. also IG II 1361.\n11.Cf. also Ignatius’ attitude in To the Ephesians 7:1; 8:1; 9:1; To the Smyrnaeans. \n4:1; 5:1; 7:2. Cf. also Smalley (1984:334); Johnson (2011:158). Smith (s.a.:5203) \ncompares this situation to John’s behaviour towards Cerinthus. \n', 'Page 5 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.ve.org.za doi:10.4102/ve.v36i1.1483\ngreeting the person is also interpreted in many ways, but it \nbasically refers to the ‘cultivation of personal acquaintance \nand fraternal intercourse with the false teachers’ (Elwell \n1995:ad loc.; Lange 2008:192).18 This interpretation is in line \nwith the idea that the injunction here does not aim at being \nrude, but at discouraging dangerous social interaction.19\nThis implies that the prohibition in 2 John 10–11 need not be \nseen as unchristian, unloving or harsh. It was an accepted \nway in which groups treated people who no longer operated \nwithin the confines of a particular group. This does not seem \nto and ought not be the problem for commentators. When it \ndoes become a problem, so it seems, is when the expectations \nof hospitality come into play. It is felt that it is rude or \nunloving not to offer this basic courtesy.\nIs this really a hospitality text?\nFrom the above arguments it is clear that the exclusion of the \nidea that this is a hospitality text clarifies a lot of problems. \nAre there other indications in this short text that hospitality is \nnot the main focus or even a focus? I have argued this in more \ndetail elsewhere and need not repeat the detail arguments \n(Van der Watt 2015). I will just briefly touch on one or two of \nthe major arguments to indicate the line of thinking.\nIn considering a possible scenario two issues complicate \nmatters: (1) why does the Presbyter only rejoice about some \nof the children walking in the truth? Are there others who do \nnot, and if this is the case why not and what are they doing \ninstead? (2) The Lady is advised not to receive the visitors \ninto her home and not to give them any greeting. If these \nare unknown visitors, how would the Lady know what they \nstand for before receiving them into the meeting? She will \nthen in any case be bound to greet them first. In reconciling \nthese two problems, a scenario that the visitors were local \nand not foreign, and that some of the Lady’s children already \nhad contact with the false teachers (although not necessarily \njoining them yet), explaining why they do not behave in \nthe truth, would not support a hospitality situation. Malina \n(1986:181) reminded us that hospitality in its true sense \nshould be limited to outsiders who come with letters of \nrecommendation from ‘friends of friends’. If they were local, \ntheir position would have been known and the Lady would \nknow not to receive or greet them. It would also explain why \n‘some’ of the Lady’s children did not walk in the truth, since \nthey were not convinced about the convictions of the Lady on \nthe religious level. They were still part of the physical family \nof the Lady, but did not share her religious views in which \nher group’s behaviour was grounded. This tension in the \nfamily of the Lady is addressed by the emphasis on love and \ntruth (2 Jn 5–6). If that is restored the false teachers would not \n18.Lücke (1837:332–333) remarks, ‘salutation … [was] in the apostolic age, full of \nexpression and signs of the Christian communion of faith and of brotherly-love’. \nKeener (1993:ad loc.) notes that in the Qumran society someone who provided \nfor an apostate was expelled from that community together with the apostate. \n19.The opposite is true of 3 John. There the visitors are of high repute, (at least from \nthe perspective of the Presbyter – perhaps not from the perspective of Diotrephes; \ncf. Brown 1986:690), but Diotrephes is not acting according to the truth – his deeds \nare evil by not extending hospitality. These visitors will not endanger his group as \nsuch, although it seems as if Diotrephes was of another opinion. \nIn 2 John the teaching (διδαχὴν – v. 10) and behaviour (τοῖς \nἔργοις – v. 11) of the visitors are judged negatively, and from \nthe context it seems that social intercourse with these people \nwould negatively influence the group and could endanger \ntheir mutual love.12 This is the problem addressed in verses \n5–6 which is also contextually linked to the false teachers \nwith a ὅτι-phrase in verse 7. The reaction to such features that \nendangered the group in the Bacchic statutes was expulsion \n(i.e. severing social contact). According to these statutes the \norder within the group is of higher value than the presence \nof such a disrupting person. This is also the case in 2 John, as \nSmalley (1984:333) remarks: ‘John is not therefore forbidding \nprivate hospitality, but rather an official welcome into the \ncongregation, with the widespread opportunities which would \nthen be available for the heretics to promote their cause.’\nAs such it is not a matter of hospitality, but of accepted \nsocial mechanisms protecting group identity and activity.13 \nThe latter value overrides personal needs. This puts the \ncommand in 2 John 10 in another perspective. If it was the \ncase that such people appealed to a Christian house church \nfor hospitality then their right to hospitality is overruled14 by \nthe fact that the group is of the opinion that their presence \nwill endanger the group. If they were to be allowed they \nwould have to be excluded in the end if they persisted in \ntheir destructive teachings. This allows for a legitimate \nrefusal even for offering hospitality.15 So, hospitality as such \nis not negated here, but the conventions surrounding social \nactivities within groups does not make reception of these \npeople within the group an option, due to proven negative \nteachings and behaviour.\nThese visitors were indeed representatives of a related but \nopposing group. The refusal to receive or even greet them \n(2 Jn 11) amounts to more than expulsion. It boils down to \nmaking a doctrinal statement thereby confirming one’s own \nposition. By turning them away, their teachings are not only \nrejected, but any assistance for continuation of such teaching \nis refused (Schnackenburg 1984:317; Brown 1986:690; Kruse \n2000:213; compare 2 Jn 11 with 3 Jn 8). No form of co-operation \n(koinõnia)16 or association is offered.17 The reference to not \n12.Lücke (1837:332–333) is of the opinion that such integration would lead to a \ncorruption of the truth and should therefore be discouraged. \n13.Sometimes these categories are mixed. Smalley (1984:333–334), for instance, \nacknowledges that here it is not a case of private hospitality (such a distinction \nbetween private and public seems highly unlikely in ancient cultures) but public \nwelcome in a congregation, but he nevertheless categorises and discusses it under \n‘hospitality as Christian virtue’. Clearer formulation is needed. \n14.Bultmann (1973:114) opines that ‘hospitality which was taken as obligatory \nelsewhere in primitive Christianity is not to be extended to itinerant heretics’. Cf. \nalso Smith (s.a.:5204).\n15.Ebrard (1860:393–395) already expressed this sentiment a century and half ago \nwhen he argued that the ‘Lady’ should neither have religious nor social contact \nwith the heretics. ‘The vain and aimless friendly intercourse with such liars \nmust be broken off at once.’ The question whether this injunction supposes \n‘excommunication’ is pre-mature, since there is no evidence of a universal church \nor church ruling. What happens here happens on local level where the group of the \n‘Lady’ seemingly has considerable freedom (Strecker 1989:347).\n16.For the semantic range of koinõnia, see Ogereau (2014) who has convincingly \nshown that the word refers to co-operation that is based on relations.\n17.Brown (1986:690–691) puts it in these words: ‘The inhospitality urged by vv. 10–11 \nis part of the warfare between Christ and Antichrist, between the Spirit of Truth \nand the Spirit of Deceit …’. In this ‘war’ harbouring the enemy in your ‘camp’ is \nnot an option. \n', 'Page 6 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.ve.org.za doi:10.4102/ve.v36i1.1483\nbe able to destroy the lady’s group and prevent them from \nwinning the full award (2 Jn 8).\nThe identity of the visitors is not mentioned directly in the \ntext, except for the fact that they are false witnesses. That \nthey were visiting missionaries is an assumption, as is the \nfocus on hospitality. Above it was argued that the situation \npresented in the text would make more sense if these false \nteachers were locals who did not appeal for hospitality but \nsimply wanted to spread their false teaching within the \ngroup of the Lady.\nThis then results in another emphasis in reading the Letter. \nQuestions about tensions between 2 John 10–11 and showing \nChristian love and courtesy, refusing basic hospitality are no \nlonger relevant. The issue is rather what the reaction should \nbe if a group is being penetrated by false teachers who will \nnot only disrupt the group members that are apparently \nalready under tensions regarding love among one another, \nbut also have the potential of destroying them (2 Jn 8). \nAs was argued above, there is ample evidence that such \nsituations did not only threaten the Christian gatherings, but \nalso other social groups like guilds. The response across the \nboard seems to be the same: protect the group by breaking \nsocial contact if the evil doers do not want to conform, or \nat least until they are willing to conform and cease their \ndestructive behaviour.\nThis option is indeed recognised in the debate. Commentators \n– even those who propose a hospitality framework for \ninterpreting this text – are virtually unanimous that the \nessence of what 2 John 10 communicates is that the church \ngroup should be protected against harm.20 For this reason, \nSchnackenburg (1984:316; cf. also Carson 1994:1412; Johnson \n2011:159) does not want to interpret this injunction as \ncontra to the commands of love for enemies (Mt 5:44–48) or \nreconciliation (Mt 5:23–25). He rather links this situation with \nthe command of Jesus to his disciples to break contact with \npeople who do not welcome the message of the Kingdom \n(Mt 10:14; Lk 10:10–11).21 Smalley (1984:334) argues along \nthe same lines, claiming that the Presbyter neither prohibits \nlove to others nor forbids all contact with the heterodox. \nContact with them is necessary to change their minds (cf. Mt \n9:10–12).22 According to Smalley (1984:334), the Presbyter is \nwarning against the dangers of receiving heretics and thus \nstrengthening their erroneous position, compromising the \ntruth. Akin (2001:233; cf. Lange 2008:192; Kelly 1905:404–\n405; Kistemaker 1986:383; Walls & Anders 1999:238) agrees \nthat the point in question is not prohibiting conversations \nwith the ‘spiritually confused’ or with people with whom \nthe message of Christ should be shared by allowing them \n20.Plummer (1886:139) interprets it in an even wider sense, namely, that charity \nshown to one man should not harm others. \n21.Carson (1994:ad loc.) remarks that in ancient times receiving somebody in one’s \nhome ‘was to express one’s approval of his teachings’. This should not be confused \nwith expressing ‘common courtesy to a doctrinal opponent’.\n22.Ebrard (1860:394) has a harsh opinion about this, remarking, ‘A Christian man \nshould have to do with these deniers of Christ only for the one sole end of their \nconversion: as soon as he sees that his great object is spurned, he has nothing \nmore to do with them’. \nto visit your house in order to confront them with the \nclaims of Christ. No rudeness is suggested. It is rather to \nprohibit support and aid to false teachers and thus avoid \ndisseminating error. This is essential for the health of the \nchurch.\nSome concluding remarks\nThe question now is, what do we do with this information in \nour present-day situation? It surely has ethical implications. \nViews differ as to how these verses should be treated today, \ndepending on the hermeneutical approach to the canonical \ntext. Should the text have a direct mechanical impact on \ncurrent events (a more fundamentalist approach); should \nanalogy be the key; should it be regarded as an example that \ncould be followed or not; is it just an interesting event in an \nearly Christian situation? This is not the place to consider the \nhermeneutic complexities. It suffices to point out what the \nmajor thrust of the prohibition in 2 John 10–11 seemingly is, \nas I tried to argue.\nIssues taken with the applicability of this prohibition on \ncontemporary situations, as was described under point \n1 at the beginning of the essay, should be more carefully \nconsidered. What the text exactly intends should be clarified \nand that point should then be considered, with its implications \nof course. It was shown above that this prohibition is not \nagainst love, care, and hospitality on an ordinary everyday \nlevel and should also not by analogy be applied to today’s \nsituations. The issue is what happens if a false teacher comes \nto your congregation and claims access to promote his views \nwhich might harm your group that is already under some \ncommunal stress (i.e., there are some tensions that point to \nlack of love or co-operation among the group). Allowing \nsuch a false teacher access might potentially harm or even \ndestroy your congregation (2 Jn 8). Must such a person with \nthe Christian group’s blessing be allowed to continue with \nhis work in your midst? Obviously the Presbyter does not \nthink that is a good idea – to the contrary!23\nA last remark: does this mean that the Johannine group \nshould therefore not approach the world with their message \nor should not go into discussions with opponents? This is \nnot what 2 John 10–11 implies or tries to address. The text \ndoes not focus on the missionary task of the Johannine \ngroup (which is clearly stated in Jn 17:18 or 20:21–22), but \naddresses another problem, namely, allowing threatening \nfalse prophets to destroy the congregation. A conclusion \nfrom silence regarding the absence of remarks in 2 John \nabout missionary activities by the Lady’s group itself \nshould not be interjected into the situation as if it was an \nissue here.\n23.I do not want to go into the criticism that in Christian debates virtually always \nconsists of two opposing groups each claiming truth. In 2 John this also was the \ncase, but the Presbyter clarified the situation, pointing out truth from falseness. \nHe applies criteria like the traditional message (2 Jn 5–6), especially related to the \ntraditional Christological confession. From there other convictions and correct \nbehaviour are motivated. \n', 'Page 7 of 7 Original Research\nhttp://www.ve.org.za doi:10.4102/ve.v36i1.1483\nAcknowledgements\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that he has no financial or personal \nrelationships which may have inappropriately influenced \nhim in writing this article.\nReferences\nAkin, D.L., 2001, 1, 2, 3 John, Broadman & Holman Publishers, Nashville, TN.\nBanks, R.J., 2012, Paul’s idea of community, Baker, Grand Rapids, MI.\nBrown, R.E., 1986, The Epistles of John, Doubleday, Garden City, NY.\nBultmann, R., 1973, The Johannine Epistles: A commentary on the Johannine Epistles, \nFortress, Philadelphia, PA.\nCarson, D.A., France, R.T., Moryer, J.A., & Wenham, G.J., (eds.), 1994, New Bible \ncommentary: 21st century edition, Inter-Varsity Press, Downers Grove, IL.\nCocke, A.R., 1895, Studies in the Epistles of John; or, The manifested life, Presbyterian \nCommittee of Publication, Richmond, VA.\nDodd, C.H., 1946, The Johannine Epistles, Hodder & Stoughton, London.\nDu Rand, J.A., 1997, Johannine perspectives, Orion, Pretoria.\nEbrard, J.H.A., 1860, Biblical commentary on the Epistles of St. John, in continuation of \nthe work of Olshausen, transl.
