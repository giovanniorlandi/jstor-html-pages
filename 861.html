Data reveal that the weight-normative approach is not effective for most people because of high rates of weight regain\nand cycling from weight loss interventions, which are linked to adverse health and well-being. Its predominant focus on weight\nmay also foster stigma in health care and society, and data show that weight stigma is also linked to adverse health and well-being.\nIn contrast, data support a weight-inclusive approach, which is included in models such as Health at Every Size for improving\nphysical (e.g., blood pressure), behavioral (e.g., binge eating), and psychological (e.g., depression) indices, as well as acceptability of\npublic health messages. Therefore, the weight-inclusive approach upholds nonmaleficience and beneficience, whereas the weightnormative\napproach does not. We offer a theoretical framework that organizes the research included in this review and discuss how\nit can guide research efforts and help health professionals intervene with their patients and community.\n1. Introduction\nJasmine is waiting in the exam room and her chart shows\nthat her weight today is up five pounds from her last visit\ntwo years ago, putting her BMI at 32. Her blood pressure was\nborderline high in contrast to the normal readings in previous\nvisits. Although Jasmine’s labs were normal in past visits, they\nare out of date. When Dr. Johnson greets her today, Jasmine\nseems anxious and tells Dr. Johnson, “I almost did not come\nin today knowingmyweight is up from the last time Iwas here\nand you suggested a diet. I feel like such a failure. However,\nI need help for my migraines, so here I am.” Dr. Johnson and\nJasmine look at each other, there is a beat of silence, and they\nboth sigh. Dr. Johnson thinks about all the moments like this\none. Usually patients are coming in reluctantly, with medical\nissues that cannot wait any longer.There is a palpable sense of\nfrustration about yet another problem related to high weight.\nThere is a predictably tense discussion about what needs to\nhappen. Promises are made, referrals are given, and patients\ndrop out of sight until the next medical crisis that absolutely\ncannot be ignored. Dr. Johnson cannot help but think, “Could\nthere be a better way?”\nWeight management (i.e., weight loss and weight cycling)\nis a central component of health improvement and health\ncare regimens in the United States and similarly westernized\ncountries. Regardless of whether or not it is relevant to\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nJournal of Obesity\nVolume 2014, Article ID 983495, 18 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/983495\n', '2 Journal of Obesity\nthe presenting concern, patients seeking medical evaluations\nor treatment are typically evaluated first on the basis of\ntheir weight [1–3]. For example, primary care guidelines\nrecommend that higher-weight individuals with a BMI above\n30 should be provided with weight loss interventions and\nnutritional advice automatically even if their presenting\nconcerns are unrelated to body weight [4], whereas lowerweight\nindividuals may not be given a blood sugar evaluation\nbecause they do not fit the “high-risk profile” of a person\nwith type II diabetes [2]. A weight-centric emphasis in\nmedical care may overshadow patients’ health concerns and\nneeds, potentially leading to “false negatives” (i.e., failure\nto diagnose a true condition because a patient’s weight is\nclassified as average) in addition to the “false positives” (i.e.,\nmisdiagnosing a healthy higher-weight patient as unhealthy,\nthus prescribing weight loss).\nThe vignette above underscores the fact that many practitioners\nand patients are frustrated and fatigued by this\nprocess of pursuing weight loss and weight cycling [5–8],\nincreased patient shame [9–11], and intensified weight bias\nfrom the health care provider [12–18]. Health professionals\nare responsible for adhering to ethical principles in the care\nof their patients, such as beneficience (i.e., the obligation to\nbenefit and contribute to optimum health for patients and\ncommunities) and nonmaleficience (i.e., the obligation to\navoid harming patients and communities). Yet, the dominant\nfocus on weight loss and weight management may move\nhealth care professionals away from these principles, creating\na dilemma in the delivery of ethical care and public health\npromotion.This dilemma occurs because aweight-normative\napproach to health emphasizes the pursuit of weight loss,\ndespite extensive evidence demonstrating that weight loss is\nnot sustainable long-term formost people [19–21] and weight\ncycling (commonly associated with weight loss efforts) is\nlinked to adverse health [6–8].\nIn this paper, we review evidence that challenges the\nweight-normative approach for health promotion and offer\nevidence to support a weight-inclusive approach for health\npromotion. Instead of imagining that well-being is only\npossible at a specific weight, a weight-inclusive approach considers\nempirically supported practices that enhance people’s\nhealth in patient care and public health settings regardless\nof where they fall on the weight spectrum [1, 2, 22]. These\napproaches differ in the emphasis each one places on weight.\nWhile health care professionals using either approach may\nshare some commonalities (e.g., recommending similar selfcare\npractices), they contrast in the relative importance they\nplace on body weight in the context of health and medical\ntreatment, their perceptions of themalleability of weight, and\nhow they respond to patients based on their weight.\nFar from being radical, we view adopting a weightinclusive\napproach as more conservative than a weight-\nnormative approach for facilitating health because it does not\nrecommend a treatment option that showsmore documented\nrisks to patients than benefits. Prescribing weight loss carries\nthe risk of adverse outcomes for adherents and lacks evidence\nfor sustainability over time, potentially setting many patients\non a path of weight cycling [23, 24]. The weight-inclusive\napproach acknowledges the scientific (albeit unpopular)\nevidence that people have little choice about what they\nweigh due to the interplay between involuntary genetic and\nenvironmental factors (e.g., lacking access to nutrient-dense\nfoods priced outside of the family food budget) [25–31]. A\nweight-inclusive approach attempts to improve patient access\nto health care by recommending that health care providers\nrecognize weight-normative biases (e.g., stereotypes that\nhigher-weight patients must have, and lower-weight patients\ndo not have, diseases often associated with obesity) and\npractices (e.g., prescribing weight-loss diets to higher-weight\npatients regardless of their physical health) within health care\nsettings and challenge them in their own interactions with\npatients [1, 2, 32–39]. Emerging over the last four decades, this\nshift away from a weight-normative approach among many\nhealth care professionals acknowledges the failure of weight\nloss and weight management goals for improving health and\nrecognizes the many factors that do support human health\nand well-being.\nThe issue of whether to adopt a weight-normative or\nweight-inclusive approach to health is not simply a philosophical\nmatter. Large-scale interventions designed to affect\nmasses of people are being implemented on the basis of\nthe weight-normative approach. A recent scopic review of\npapers on the unintended harm caused by public health\ninterventions found that over a third of the papers covered\nthe possible harmful effects of obesity-related public\nhealth efforts [40]. Obesity-related public heath efforts were\nidentified as potentially harmful because they (a) have been\nbased on limited or poor quality evidence, (b) focus on\npreventing one extreme outcome at the expense of another\nextreme outcome (boomerang effects), (c) lack community\nengagement, and (d) ignore the root cause of the problems.\nIf pursuit of the most ethical and effective pathways to health\nand well-being is the priority, and health care professionals\nintend to uphold the principle of doing no harm, we argue\nan alternative to the weight-normative approach is required.\nIn the following sections, we review the problems and\nlimitations of the weight-normative approach to health and\nthen highlight theweight-inclusive approach as an alternative\nmodel for health care and health improvement.\n2. The Weight-Normative Approach\nWe refer to the many principles and practices of health care\nand health improvement that prioritize weight as a main\ndeterminant of health as the weight-normative approach.\nThis approach rests on the assumption thatweight anddisease\nare related in a linear fashion, with disease and weight\nincreasing in tandem.Under theweight-normative approach,\npersonal responsibility for “healthy lifestyle choices” and the\nmaintenance of “healthy weights” are emphasized. On the\nbasis of these beliefs, the weight-normative approach focuses\non weight loss and weight management to prevent and treat\na myriad of health problems. Despite the ubiquitous and\npervasive nature of the weight-normative approach, we argue\nthat a critical examination of the evidence does not support\n', 'Journal of Obesity 3\nsuch a focus on weight and weight loss to improve health or\nprevent obesity.\nFirst, despite the widely held belief within the medical\ncommunity and general population that a higher body mass\nindex (BMI) causes poor health, data do not (and cannot)\nsupport this link. The risk for mortality is highest for people\nwith BMIs < 18.5 (underweight) and BMIs > 35 (obese II),\nbut lowest for people with BMIs 25 to <30 (overweight), and\nthe risk of those with BMIs 18.5 to <25 (average weight)\nand BMIs 30 to 35 (obese I) is comparable to and falls\nbetween the other groups [41–43]. Indeed, BMI is a corollary\nof certain conditions such as osteoarthritis, sleep apnea,\nhypertension, and coronary heart disease [44–47]. However,\nthe data available cannot confirm that BMI causes these\ndiseases, as causality can only be inferred via experimental\ndesigns. Other factors often partially or fully explain the links\nbetween BMI and health, such as exercise, nutrition, insulin\nresistance, and weight stigma [45–53].\nSecond, the weight-normative approach bestows negative\njudgments onto higher-weight individuals by promoting the\nview that (a) higher-weight individuals are unhealthy and\nthus a burden on society and (b) weight can be controlled\nthrough will power and thus if a person is fat, then it is due\nto poor lifestyle habits [2, 32, 54]. Given these underlying\njudgments, it is unsurprising that weight bias has been\ndocumented in professionals from a wide range of disciplines\nincluding physicians, nurses, psychologists, and dieticians\n[55]. Yet, genetic and involuntary environmental contributions\nto body weight outweigh voluntary lifestyle choices\n[25, 56–58]. Body weight is defended by a powerful biological\nsystem that reacts to a negative energy balance by lowering\nmetabolism and increasing hunger, food preoccupation, and\nhedonic responses to food [26, 27]. Longitudinal research has\nfound that children whose parents used restrictive feeding\nhave a higher likelihood of eating in the absence of hunger\nand an elevated BMI later in childhood [58–60]. Lowerincome\nfamilies and communities may find it impossible\nto purchase high-quality nutrient-dense foods such as fresh\nfruits and vegetables given their limited budget and/or access\nto such foods [28–30, 61, 62]. Instead, refined grains and\nadded sugars, fats, and preservatives are generally inexpensive\nand readily available in lower-income communities\n[28–30]. Furthermore, lower-income neighborhoods have\nfewer physical activity resources, such as parks, green spaces,\nbike paths, and recreational facilities when compared to\nhigher income neighborhoods [63, 64]. Crime, traffic, and\nunsafe playground equipment are also barriers to physical\nactivity in lower-income communities [65, 66]. Thus, there\nare important limitations placed on the degree to which\nbody weight can be altered through voluntary action, making\npublic health messages to “maintain a healthy weight” appear\nboth uninformed and unfair.\nThird, the promotion of “healthy weight” as the key\nto health and well-being may instill a sense of learned\nhelplessness in the majority of people who will be unable\nto attain these weight-based goals [1, 2, 5, 36]. If attempts\nto reach and maintain a “healthy” weight continually fail\nor are seen as impossible given available resources, the\npractice of healthy behaviors may be seen as futile. Overall,\nthere is considerable evidence that the focus on weight and\nweight loss is linked to diminished health. In the following\nsections we review a number of failures and aggravating\ncircumstances of the weight-normative approach to elucidate\nwhy change is needed.\n2.1. The Data behind the Failure of Weight Loss Interventions.\nRising weight trends in western societies have created\nan intense focus on weight loss initiatives, but none have\ngenerated long-term results for the majority of participants.\nAs stated by Jeffery and colleagues, despite a plethora of\ninterventions that result in initial weight loss, participants\n“almost always fail to maintain the behavior changes that\nbrought them these positive results” [20]. For example, it\nhas been estimated that no more than 20% of participants\nwho complete weight-based lifestyle interventions maintain\nweight loss one year later [21], and the percentage of people\nmaintaining weight loss continues to drop by the second\nyear [19]. A meta-analysis of 29 studies on structured weight\nloss programs conducted in the United States found that\nparticipants regained 77% of their initial weight loss, on\naverage, after five years [67]. As it stands, these outcomes\nare disheartening and not encouraging, but if we actually\ncritically evaluate these studies, it is likely that the statistics\nformaintenance of weight loss are evenworse.That is,most of\nthese statistics are taken from published studies and therefore\nmay represent the most “promising” findings in terms of\nweight maintenance and omit data from the people who\ndrop out and are more likely to have regained weight. Also,\nthese studies tend to be based on rigorous trials of weight\nloss programs at the exclusion of more commonly employed\nstrategies andhave rigid exclusion criteria (e.g., comorbidities\nsuch as mood disorders or binge eating disorder).\n2.2. The Data behind the Dangers of Weight Cycling. Often\ndiet failure is accompanied by weight cycling or “yo-yo\ndieting”—repeated periods of weight loss and weight gain\n[23]. Twenty years ago, Brownell and Rodin published a foundational\npaper reviewing adverse medical, metabolic, and\npsychological health outcomes linked to weight cycling [23,\n24]. Indeed, a large body of literature has connected weight\ncycling directly to compromised health, including higher\nmortality, higher risk of osteoporotic fractures and gallstone\nattacks, loss ofmuscle tissue [6–8], hypertension [51], chronic\ninflammation [52], and some forms of cancer such as renal\ncell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\n[50]. Here, we highlight two seminal contributions\nto our understanding of this link between weight cycling\nand compromised health. The landmark Framingham Heart\nStudy was perhaps one of the most jarring indictments of\nweight cycling [6]. Using a sophisticated definition of weight\ncycling (capturing frequency andmagnitude of fluctuations),\nmortality and morbidity were examined in more than 5000\nindividuals over a 32-year period. Results indicated that\nweight cycling was strongly linked to overall mortality, as\nwell as mortality and morbidity related to coronary heart\ndisease for both men and women. Similar results were found\nin the EFFORT cohort study conducted in Germany [7],\n', '4 Journal of Obesity\nwhich only included men, a generally underrepresented\npopulation in the weight cycling literature. In this study, 505\nmiddle-aged men were grouped into the weight categories of\nstable nonobese, stable obese, weight loss, weight gain, and\nweight fluctuations. Among these groupings, only the weight\nfluctuations category was associated with mortality over the\n15-year follow-up period. Of greatest interest, the stable obese\ncategory was not linked to higher risk of death relative to the\nstable nonobese category.\nWeight cycling also has been shown to be connected\nto compromised physical health and psychological wellbeing.\nIn an experimental study, Leibel et al. revealed that\nprospective weight loss led to reductions in metabolic energy\nexpenditure [68]. The authors suggested that this reduction\nwould make it difficult for their participants to maintain\ntheir newly suppressed weight. Research has shown that in\norder to maintain current BMI, formerly overweight dieters\nmust eat less than their same-BMI counterparts who were\nnever overweight [69]. As an illustration, a formerly obese\nwoman with a BMI of 24 might be restricted to 1500 kcal/day,\nwhereas a woman with a BMI of 24 who was never obese\nmight be able to eat as much as 2000 kcal/day. The formerly\nobese woman might therefore have to employ more rigid\ndietary habits in order to make sure that her calories do\nnot exceed 1500 kcal/day. Further evidence for a metabolic\ndisruption was demonstrated in a study of 109 Korean\nwomen who participated in a community-based weight loss\nprogram [53]. Those with a history of weight cycling (43%\nof the sample) lost more lean muscle mass but not more\nbody fat and lagged behind in positive changes to body\ncomposition and cholesterol, compared to their nonweight\ncycling counterparts, despite having lost a similar amount of\nweight overall.\nGreater emotional distress was found to be connected to\nweight cycling among men and women, especially those who\nexpected to have more personal and social success when thin\n(e.g., “I will be more successful, loved, desired, and healthy\nonce I am thin/lean”), a mindset that the weight-normative\napproach cultivates [70]. Similarly, based on participants\nfrom the large Nurses’ Health Study II, Field and colleagues\nfound that women with a weight cycling history (39% of\nthe sample) gained more weight over time and engaged\nin less physical activity but more binge eating than their\nnoncycling peers [24]. Another recent study found that\nweight cycling is common among African American women\n(63% of the sample) and is associatedwith poor psychological\noutcomes, such as binge eating, thinness expectations, and\nself-esteem [71]. Overall, research conducted around the\nworld for the past 25 years has repeatedly shown that weight\ncycling is inextricably linked to adverse physical health and\npsychological well-being.\n2.3. The Risk of Eating Disorders in the Maintenance of Weight\nLoss. There is growing evidence that individuals who try to\nachieve andmaintain a weight-suppressed state are at risk for\nbinge eating disorder [72, 73] and bulimia nervosa [74, 75],\nlikely because of the dietary rigidity needed to maintain a\nweight-suppressed state and the binge eating that may follow\nonce the diet is “broken.” Leading researchers have found that\nrigid dieting is usually disrupted by episodes of overeating\n[72, 76] and is associated with eating in the absence of hunger\n[73] in experimental research. In some individuals, these\ntemporary losses of control are accompanied by subsequent\nbehaviors employed to compensate for calories consumed\nduring a binge episode (e.g., vomiting, laxative misuse,\nexcessive exercise, and fasting) [72–74]. Abrupt disruptions\nin caloric expenditures brought on by binge eating and the\nuse of compensatory behaviors may also be linked to weight\ncycling and the associated negative outcomes described above\n[72, 76].\nFurthermore, attempts to suppress weight are associated\nwith poorer outcomes in treating patients with bulimia: those\nwho have bulimia who try to maintain a weight-suppressed\nstate are likely to binge eat [77], gain weight [75, 78], and drop\nout of psychotherapeutic treatment [77]. Notably, behavioral\nweight loss (BWL) has been considered one treatment option\nfor binge eating disorder (BED). A rigorous examination of\nthree approaches to treat BED found that individuals with\nBEDwho were randomly assigned to a BWL treatment group\nexperienced a small reduction (Cohen’s 𝑑 = 0.25) in BMI\nafter treatment but did not maintain this reduction one year\nor two years later [79]. The other two treatment approaches\n(interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy)\ndid not reduce participants BMI from baseline to the\nfollow-up periods.While the other two treatment approaches\nreduced binge eating, BWL did not.\nIt stands to reason, then, thatweight suppression and food\nrestriction should not be goals of treatment. Since dieting has\nbeen associated with the onset and maintenance of eating\ndisorders, and the cessation of dieting is a crucial step in\nthe treatment of eating disorders, encouraging higher-weight\npatients to enter a weight-suppressed state by dieting is likely\nphysically harmful and hence violates professional codes of\nethics [80–84].\n2.4. Heightened Weight Stigma under the Weight-Normative\nApproach. The emphasis on achieving a “healthy” weight\nimplies that there is a healthy or normal weight that each of us\nshould be striving to attain andmaintain.Moreover, themedical\nendorsement of normative weights gives credibility to\ncultural messages prizing thinness (for women), leanness (for\nmen), and weight loss. Internalization of socially prescribed\nbody ideals is related to body shame, body dissatisfaction,\neating disorders for women [74, 85–88], and potentially\nharmful muscle-enhancing and disordered eating behaviors\nfor men [89]. The medical and cultural emphasis on “good\nweights” and “bad weights” produces the opportunity for\nweight stigma.\nWeight stigma refers to negative weight-related attitudes\nand beliefs that manifest as stereotypes, rejection, prejudice,\nand discrimination towards individuals of higher weights\n[90]. There are many forms of weight stigma [91], including\nrepeated weight-related teasing, bullying, harassment,\nviolence, hostility, ostracism, pressures to lose weight/be\nthin, negative appearance commentary, and weight-related\n', 'Journal of Obesity 5\nmicroaggressions. Microaggressions are intentional or unintentional\nverbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities\nthat communicate hostility or negativity toward people who\nhold less power in society [92]. For example, suggesting a diet\nto a patient when the patient came in for a concern unrelated\nto weight would be a weight-related microaggression. Complimentary\nweightism, or appearance-related compliments\n(e.g., Telling a patient, “You’ve lost weight. . .looking good!”),\nis also stigmatizing because although seemingly positive on\nthe surface, it still marks people as good or bad based on their\nweight [93].\nWeight stigma occurs across a range of life domains,\nincluding school settings (higher-weight children are often\nstigmatized by peers, classmates, teachers, and school administrators)\n[94–98], health care environments (higher-weight\npatients are stigmatized by healthcare professionals and\ninsurance companies) [12–15], public health initiatives [37,\n99, 100], workplace settings (higher-weight employees are\njudged negatively by coworkers, supervisors, and employers)\n[101, 102], and interpersonally by loved ones (intimate partners,\nfriends, and parents) [90, 103]. Some obstetricians and\ngynecologists in southern Florida have refused to perform\nmedical services for women over 200 lbs [104]. In a large\nsample of women who were classified as overweight or obese,\n69% experienced weight bias by a physician (with over half\nreporting bias on multiple occasions), 46% from nurses, 37%\nfrom dietitians, and 21% from health professionals [105].\nPsychologists have been found to ascribe more pathology,\ngreater severity of symptoms, and worse prognosis to obese\npatients when compared to thinner patients presenting\nwith identical psychological profiles [106]. Weight stigma\nis also manifested in sociostructural barriers to accessing\nmedical care (e.g., insurance companies that will not cover\nhigher-weight individuals), and within the medical setting,\nbarriers to appropriately sized equipment [3, 107]. Health\ncare professionals’ ignorance about the medical needs of\nhigher-weight individuals, such as appropriate surgical procedures\nor proper dosages of medicine and chemotherapy\nfor higher-weight individuals, is also a form of weight stigma\n[107].\nIronically, many professionals who treat obesity [16]\nand eating disorders [18] exhibit weight bias towards their\npatients. Health professionals who specialize in the field\nof obesity and weight-loss treatment demonstrate varying\ndegrees of antifat bias, attributing negative stereotypes such\nas lazy, stupid, and worthless to higher-weight people [17].\nAmong professionals treating eating disorders, 56% observed\nother professionals in their field making negative comments\nabout obese patients, 42% believed that practitioners who\ntreat eating disorders often hold negative stereotypes about\nobese patients, and 35% indicated that practitioners feel\nuncomfortable caring for those who are obese [18]. Eating\ndisorder professionals with stronger weight stigma were\nmore likely to attribute obesity to behavioral causes and\nperceived poorer treatment outcomes for these patients.\nWhen health providers attribute weight-related stereotypes\nto their patients, it affects the quality of care that patients\nalong the weight spectrum receive. Experiencing weight bias\nin health care settings may discourage higher-weight patients\nfrom making prohealth lifestyle changes and seeking routine\nor preventative care and encourage lower psychological wellbeing\n[55, 100, 105].\nDue to the focus on weight evaluation and privileging\nthinness, even lower-weight individuals could experience\nweight-related stigma and microaggressions. For example,\nlower-weight individuals may be told that they are “hated”\nbecause they can “eat anything and still be thin,” harming\ntheir interpersonal relationships. Health care professionals\nmay ignore lower-weight individuals’ symptoms suggestive\nof sleep apnea and type II diabetes because they do not fit\nthe “weight profile” tied to these conditions. Even patients\nwho are not “flagged” for their weight may be engaging\nin disordered eating behaviors that are detrimental to their\nhealth (e.g., the BMI of those who have bulimia is usually in\nthe average range [108]).\nUsing national survey data with a 10-year follow-up,\nSchafer and Ferraro found that societal weight stigma is\nlinked to internalizedweight stigma [109]. Internalizedweight\nstigma refers to the degree to which individuals personally\nadopt negative weight-based societal stereotypes and judge\nthemselves and others based on these stereotypes [10, 110, 111].\nThis self-judgment may foster body blame and body shame\n(e.g., “If only I wasn’t so large, I would not be teased—I am\ntherefore ashamed of my body”) and appearance monitoring\n(e.g., vigilant about wearing slimming clothing to prevent\nothers’ from stigmatizing her body). Internalized weight bias\nis not related to BMI; thus, a person of any weight can\nexperience and internalize weight bias and discrimination\n[112].\nIt is important to understand the associations between\nweight stigma and diminished health and well-being.\nAlthough research has challenged the assumption that high\nBMI causes disease, these variables do covary. One explanation\nfor why they might covary is the experience of weight\nstigma [48]. Weight stigma is associated with increased\ncaloric consumption, a pattern which challenges the common\nwisdom that pressures to lose weight will motivate\noverweight individuals to lose weight [49]. Across a 4year\nlongitudinal study of a large, nationally representative\nstudy of community adults, those who experienced weight\nstigma were 2.5 times more likely than those who were\nnot stigmatized to become obese [113]. Priming overweight\nwomen to think about weight-related stereotypes (i.e., inducing\nweight stigma) led them to report significantly dimin-\nished exercise and dietary health intentions [114]. Further,\nSchafer and Ferraro found that weight stigma was related to\nincreased health risks that are typically attributed to being\nobese, such as functional disability and decreased self-rated\nhealth, over a 10-year period [109]. The evidence further\nindicates that weight stigma is related to elevated ambulatory\nblood pressure [115], unhealthy weight control and binge\neating behaviors [116–120], bulimic symptoms [121], negative\nbody image [121–124], low self-esteem [121, 122], and\ndepression [122, 125, 126] among children, adolescents, and\nadults.\n', '6 Journal of Obesity\n3. The Weight-Inclusive Approach\nAs an alternative to the weight-normative paradigm, the\nweight-inclusive approach rests on the assumption that everybody\nis capable of achieving health and well-being indepen-\ndent of weight, given access to nonstigmatizing health care.\nThis approach challenges the belief that a particular BMI\nreflects a particular set of health practices, health status, or\nmoral character. Under this paradigm, weight is not a focal\npoint for medical treatment or intervention. Weight is not\nviewed as a behavior, but eating nutritious foodwhen hungry,\nceasing to eat when full, and engaging in pleasurable (and\nthus more sustainable) exercise are self-care behaviors that\ncan be made more accessible for people. In these ways, this\napproach also tries to minimize weight stigma and thus may\nhelp patients feel comfortable in the health care setting, more\nable to discuss their health concerns, and less likely to experience\nthe health care encounter as stigmatizing by health\ncare providers [3]. The weight-inclusive approach adheres to\nan ethical principle held by health care professions [80–84]:\n“above all, do no harm.” Accordingly, then, there are no set\nhealth-related interventions that prioritize BMI reduction as\na goal, given that a predominant focus on BMI reduction\nis linked to weight stigma and internalized weight stigma,\nwhich have detrimental connections to physical health and\nwell-being [90, 91, 100, 105, 109].\nA weight-inclusive approach seeks to (a) eradicate\nweight-based iatrogenic practices within health care and\nother health-related industries and (b) end the stigmatization\nof health problems (i.e., healthism), thereby facilitating access\nto health care for all individuals [1, 2, 32–39]. In taking\nthis approach, the blame for the failure to lose weight is\nplaced on the deleterious process of weight loss rather than\non the individual, which may help minimize internalized\nweight stigma [32]. The weight-inclusive approach follows\nsome general a priori principles for health professionals [1,\n2, 32–39]. These principles combine in various ways and in\nvarious applications in terms of policy making, the provision\nof health care within practice and the community, and the\npatient’s personal decision-making about her or his ownwellbeing\n[2, 32, 39].\n(1) Do no harm.\n(2) Appreciate that bodies naturally come in a variety\nof shapes and sizes, and ensure optimal health and\nwell-being is provided to everyone, regardless of their\nweight.\n(3) Given that health is multidimensional, maintain a\nholistic focus (i.e., examine a number of behavioral\nand modifiable health indices rather than a predominant\nfocus on weight/weight loss).\n(4) Encourage a process-focus (rather than end-goals) for\nday-to-day quality of life. For example, people can\nnotice what makes their bodies rested and energetic\ntoday and incorporate that into future behavior, but\nalso notice if it changes; they realize that well-being is\ndynamic rather than fixed. They keep adjusting what\nthey know about their changing bodies.\n(5) Critically evaluate the empirical evidence for weight\nloss treatments and incorporate sustainable, empirically\nsupported practices into prevention and treat-\nment efforts, calling for more research where the\nevidence is weak or absent.\n(6) Create healthful, individualized practices and environments\nthat are sustainable (e.g., regular pleasur-\nable exercise, regular intake of foods high in nutrients,\nadequate sleep and rest, adequate hydration). Where\npossible, work with families, schools, and communities\nto provide safe physical activity resources and\nways to improve access to nutrient-dense foods.\n(7) Where possible, work to increase health access,\nautonomy, and social justice for all individuals along\nthe entire weight spectrum. Trust that people move\ntoward greater health when given access to stigmafree\nhealth care and opportunities (e.g., gyms with\nequipment for people of all sizes; trainers who focus\non increments in strength, flexibility, V02 Max, and\npleasure rather than weight and weight loss).\nThere are many models which include a weight-inclusive\nemphasis, some more fragmentary, some more comprehensive,\nsome more focused on research evidence, some more\nreliant on clinical experience (while proponents lobby for\nnew research conceptualizations and trials), and some more\nfocused on policy and social justice while others target\nindividual health behaviors. Such models include Health at\nEvery Size (HAES) [1, 19, 32, 54, 127], Health in Every Respect\n[35], and Physical Activity at Every Size [37]. For the purposes\nof this paper, we explore one version in more depth, the\nHealth at Every Size (HAES) model, as trademarked and\ndefined by the Association for Size Diversity and Health\n(ASDAH) [54].\n3.1. Health at Every Size. The HAES model comes out of discussions\namong healthcare workers, consumers, and activists\nwho reject the use of weight, size, or BMI as a proxy for\nhealth and reject the myth that weight is a result of personal\nchoices independent of uncontrollable or involuntary genetic\nand environmental factors [1, 19, 32, 33, 54, 127]. The HAES\nmodel addresses the broad forces that support health, such\nas safe and affordable access to care. It also helps people find\nsustainable practices that support individual and community\nwell-being. Grounding itself in a social justice framework, the\nHAES model honors the healing power of social connections\nand evolves in response to the experiences and needs of a\ndiverse community.\nThe HAES model (see Figure 1) rests on the evidence\nthat while there are links between extremes of weight and\nhealth problems, evidence for the role of factors other than\nweight in people’s health is stronger [25–31]. HAES further\naffirms a holistic definition of health, which cannot be\ncharacterized as simply the absence of physical or mental\nillness, limitation, or disease, but also the presence of\nquality of life (e.g., life satisfaction), which is needed for\nphysical health and psychological well-being [1, 32, 54].\nHealth should be conceived as a resource or capacity\n', 'Journal of Obesity 7\nApplied to policy\nProvide environments that \ngive access to all the things \nthat support the well-being \nof human bodies of all sizes\nPrinciples\n(1) Do no harm (5) Include all bodies and lived experiences, a norm of diversity\n(2) Create practices and environments that are sustainable (6) Increase access, opportunity, freedom, and social justice\n(3) Keep a process focus rather than end-goals, day-to-day\nquality of life\n(7) Given that health is multidimensional, maintain a\nholistic focus\n(4) Incorporate evidence in designing interventions \nwhere there is evidence\n(8) Trust that people (and bodies!) move toward greater\nhealth given access and opportunity\nDefinition\nA model to support the health of people across the weight spectrum that challenges the current cultural \noppression of higher-weight people.

Pursuing health is neither a moral imperative nor\nan individual obligation, and health status should never\nbe used to judge, oppress, or determine the value of an\nindividual. Thereby HAES upholds the ethical principles of\nbeneficience and nonmaleficience by focusing on eradicating\nweight stigma, honoring human differences (size diversity),\nand pursuing empirically supported interventions that\npromote physical health and psychological well-being (see\n', '8 Journal of Obesity\nhttps://www.sizediversityandhealth.org/content.asp?id=197/\nfor HAES Principles [32]).\nConsistent with aweight-inclusive emphasis, HAES offers\nconcrete suggestions for how to manage decisions about\nfood and exercise in the aftermath (or absence) of a dieting\nmindset. HAES advocates for intuitive eating, based on\nevidence that demonstrates greater well-being for people\nwho attend and respond to physiological hunger and satiety\ncues to determine when and how much to eat, and who\npay attention to how certain foods affect the body (e.g.,\nin terms of energy level, stamina, and medical issues such\nas diabetes and food allergies) [34, 128–130]. Because such\nindividuals eat according to their internal cues the majority\nof the time, intuitive eating may be able to buffer situational\nand/or dissociative eating within environments that contain\nmany opportunities to eat less nutritiously (e.g., fast-food\nrestaurants, bakeries, convenience marts, etc.) [131]. Nevertheless,\nlack of sleep may disrupt hunger and satiety cues as\nit interferes with the body’s leptin and ghrelin levels [132], so\nhelping patients ensure they get adequate rest may be a goal\nfor intervention. Years of dieting and/or the experience of\nclinical eating disorders may also disrupt patients’ awareness\nof and trust in their hunger and satiety cues, and thus\ninterventions may be needed to help patients recognize and\nrely on these cues [34]. HAES also argues for pleasurable\nmovement based on evidence that exercising for pleasure\nin lieu of weight loss is linked to well-being and positive\nbody image [133]. These two particular recommendations\nare given because people have been educated to diet and\nexercise for weight loss and sometimes they need concrete\nsuggestions about how to proceed toward adaptive eating\nand exercise. Being compliant or rebellious about pursuing\nweight loss is replaced by a return to a process that honors\nthe body’s physiological signals of hunger, satiety, and need\nfor movement.\n3.2. The Data behind the Weight-Inclusive Approach. In\naddition to the data that speak against a weight-normative\napproach to health, there are also data in support of a weightinclusive\napproach. Most of this research has focused on the\nHAES model and tested it against models which emphasize\nthe weight-normative approach. Bacon and Aphramor\nreviewed the six existing randomized controlled trials of this\nresearch [36]. The inclusion criteria for the studies included\npublication in a peer-reviewed journal and an explicit focus\non self-acceptance within the HAES intervention. The HAES\nmodel resulted in both statistically and clinically significant\nimprovements for the participants on physiological measures\n(e.g., blood pressure), health practices (e.g., increased physical\nactivity), and psychological measures (e.g., self-esteem\nanddisordered eating).HAES achieved these health improvements\nmore successfully thanmodels that emphasize dieting.\nThe participants within the HAES groups also demonstrated\nincreased adherence (reduced dropout rates) and no adverse\noutcomes [36].\nTo take one illustrative example, a HAES-based program\nthat emphasized intuitive eating and size acceptance was\nevaluated against a dieting-based weight-loss program with\na sample of 30- to 45-year-old women classified as overweight\nor obese [19, 127]. Participants within each program received\nsix months of weekly group interventions followed by six\nmonths of monthly aftercare group support. Findings yielded\nmore positive results for the HAES-based program over the 1year\n[127] and 2-year [19] follow-ups. Specifically, the HAES\ngroup decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein\n(LDL cholesterol), triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure\nat the 2-year follow-up and sustained improvements from the\n1-year to 2-year follow-ups. Whereas the dieting group lost\nweight and showed initial improvements on many variables\nat the 1-year follow up, they had regained weight and did not\nsustain improvement at the 2-year follow- up [19].The HAES\ngroup decreased eating restraint, physical hunger rating,\ndisinhibited eating, drive for thinness, bulimic symptomatology,\nbody dissatisfaction, poor interoceptive awareness,\ndepression, and body image avoidance and increased selfesteem\nat both 1-year and 2-year follow-up. Correspondingly,\nparticipants in the dieting-based program only reduced\ndisinhibited eating but reported decreased self-esteem [19].\nFurthermore, attrition was higher in the diet group (41%)\ncompared to the HAES group (8%) [19, 127]. These findings\nsuggest that HAES-based interventions demonstrate better\nadherence to practices that promote physical health and\npsychological well-being than dieting-based interventions,\nand these effects can be sustained over time.\nThe focus on weight loss in the weight-normative\napproach could be understood by patients as promoting thinness\nas a goal, whereas the idealization of thinness (i.e., thin-\nideal internalization) and pursuit of thinness are challenged\nwithin the weight-inclusive approach. Research on secondary\neating disorder prevention efforts has also provided evidence\nin support of the weight-inclusive approach. For example,\nin their program of research on the Body Project, Stice and\nPresnell examined whether reducing participants’ thin-ideal\ninternalization and focus on weight loss would reduce their\ndysfunctional eating attitudes and behaviors [134]. In this\nprogram, participants engaged in a series of verbal, written,\nand behavioral exercises in which they actively critiqued the\nthin ideal.These exercises were intended to produce cognitive\ndissonance, such that their original attitudes (e.g., “I want\nto be thin,” “only if I am thin will I be beautiful”) would\nconflict with their recent behavior (e.g., role playing where\nthey convince other girls that many body types are beautiful).\nTo decrease their cognitive dissonance, participants changed\ntheir original prothinness and proweight loss attitudes to\nmake them fit with their recent behavior of rejecting the thin\nideal. Overall, the Body Project has been effective in helping\nearly-to-late adolescent girls reduce their pursuit of the thin\nideal, accept their bodies, improve mood, decrease eating\ndisorder symptoms (e.g., binge eating and use of unhealthy\nweight control behaviors), and lower the risk for developing\nfuture symptoms [135].\n3.3. Reducing Weight Stigma under the Weight-Inclusive\nApproach: A Model and Strategies. Health care professionals\nneed to work to reduce cultural and interpersonal weight\nstigma within health care and their patients’ environments\n', 'Journal of Obesity 9\nWeight\nstigma\nInternalized\nweight\nstigma\nBody shame\nAppearance\nmonitoring\nDecreased\npsychological\nwell-being\nDecreased\nphysical\nhealth\nFigure 2: Theoretical model of weight stigma and its associated variables.\nin order to facilitate the processes that bolster physical health\nand psychological well-being. On the basis of the evidence for\nthe links between weight stigma and adverse health and wellbeing\nreviewed previously [109, 113–121], and the intervening\nvariables that could help explain these links, we devised a\ntheoreticalmodel (see Figure 2) that organizes these variables\nand the associations between them.Thismodel can be used to\nhelp health care professionals identify points of intervention\nto reduce weight stigma and the other model variables that\nmay maintain lower physical health and well-being.\nSimilar to other theoretical models that positioned sociocultural\ninfluences as the source for negative body image and\ndysfunctional self-care behaviors [136–138], we positioned\nweight stigma as the starting point for negative health. In\nlight of weight stigma’s associations with internalized weight\nstigma [109], lower physical health [109, 113–115], lower psychological\nwell-being [116–121], body blame and shame [121–\n124], and appearancemonitoring [130, 139], proponents of the\nweight-inclusive approach challenge health care providers to\nexamine their ownbiases aroundweight.These biases are part\nof a wider cultural climate of weight stigma that pervades\nhealth care education and everyday life. It is possible that\nmuch of the healing power of the health care relationship\nis social—in the quality of the connection between health\ncare providers and their patients and their mutual trust and\nregard [140]. This connection is threatened for patients by\nthe experience of being stereotyped and reduced to a BMI\ncategory. Quality of care for higher-weight patients can be\noptimized by adopting effective and sensitive strategies to\ncommunicate with all patients along the weight continuum\n[55, 100]. Given the enormous social pressures to focus on\nweight loss and to connect weight loss to health, we know\nthat providers, even those with the best of intentions, may\nunintentionally give the impression that they are biased\nagainst higher-weight patients, leaving their patients feeling\nunwelcome, invisible, and shamed.\nOne way health care professionals could engage with\nhigher-weight patients is to view their office environment\nthrough a weight-inclusive lens. Does the office set-up communicate\nto all patients that their healthcare needs will be\nmet there without shame or discrimination? Or is the office\nstigmatizing from the moment they arrive? For example,\ndo waiting and exam rooms have furniture that fits higherweight\nindividuals? Do office staff automatically weigh in\nevery patient, on a scale in a public hallway, even if the\npatient is coming in for an issue totally unrelated to weight,\nfor example, a wart removal? How do nurses respond when\na patient says, “no thank you” to being weighed? What is\nthe office culture around weight? Has weight bias ever been\naddressed by the entire staff, such as through continuing\neducation or sensitivity training? Are gowns and medical\nequipment (e.g., blood pressure cuffs) stocked to fit higherweight\npatients?\nBy being a source of support and “grounding” against\nthe stigma higher-weight patients regularly face, the weightinclusive\napproach may facilitate patient adherence to health\npromoting practices and the guidance of their health care\nproviders. Health care professionals can offer this support\nthrough the provider-patient bond and by connecting individuals\nvia support groups (in person or online) that follow\nthe weight-inclusive approach. For example, HAES has a\nwebsite that could be useful to recommend for patients\n(http://www.haescommunity.org/). Table 1 provides a list of\nweight-inclusive principles and examples of how health care\nproviders can implement them in practice. We recognize that\nvarious health care professionals need to work as a team\nto fully implement these principles, with each professional\nimplementing the principles within her or his boundaries of\nexpertise.\nIn addition to the above strategies, a weight-inclusive\napproach includes a focus on intrapersonal variables that\nsustain poor physical health and well-being (see Figure 2).\nFor instance, health care professionals can become educated\nabout the links between internalized weight stigma and poor\nself-care that maintain adverse physical health and negative\npsychological well-being [9, 110–112, 121, 127], for example,\nand share this knowledge with their patients. Health care\nprofessionals can also inform patients of the rich literature\nthat explicates the bidirectional influences between physical\nhealth and well-being [141–145].That is, if patients begin selfcare\npractices that enhance physical health, theywill likely feel\nbetter psychologically as well, and these psychological gains\nare then linked to further increases in self-care practices that\nenhance health.\n', '10 Journal of Obesity\nTable 1: Translating weight-inclusive principles into weight-inclusive practice.\nWeight-inclusive principle Weight-inclusive practice\n(1) Eradicate weight stigma\nConduct trainings to inform other health care professionals about the weight-inclusive\napproach.

This\npartnership with their bodies may help detect and prevent the progression of disease.\n∗Physicians\n(5) Look for signs of diminished\nwell-being\nPresent options to alleviate distress and heighten life satisfaction; options should not be limited\nto medication.

For instance, if they report bingeing behaviors, ask about how they felt at\nthe time and contextual factors. If there is a connection, distress tolerance and mindfulness\ninterventions (e.g., Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) may be helpful.\n∗Mental health professionals\n(7) Respond to requests for weight\nloss advice with a holistic approach\nRespond (when asked by patients for advice or help with weight loss) with a holistic approach\nto health via encompassing and encouraging emotional, physical, nutritional, social, and\nspiritual health, rather than a weight-focus.\n∗Physicians, nutritionists\n(8) Sustain health promoting\npractices\nIdentify and facilitate access to healthy sustainable behaviors for patients.\n∗All health care professionals\n(9) Reconnect with food and\ninternal cues\nHelp patients (a) abandon dichotomous thinking about foods as “good” and “bad” and the\nmorality surrounding food restriction, (b) relearn how to recognize and respond to their\nhunger and satiety cues, and (c) determine how certain foods affect their bodies.\n∗Nutritionists\n∗Health care professionals who may want to take the lead in implementing this principle within their practice. We encourage a team approach whereby\nphysicians, mental health professionals, and nutritionists work together to ensure that a weight-inclusive approach is followed.\nHealth care professionals can also target internalized\nweight stigma’s links with body shame and appearance monitoring\n(see Figure 2). In particular, patients often blame and\nshame their bodies for how they look and feel, but body blame\nand shame are often responses to the wider cultural stigma\naround weight and their personal experiences of weight\ndiscrimination over their lifetimes [121–124]. Body blame\nand shame can be reframed for patients to communicate\nthat the source is likely internalized societal weight stigma\n[112, 146] from being stigmatized for their weight [109],\nand not their bodies’ actual weight or size [147]. Health\ncare professionals can also help patients mentally shift from\nhabitual appearance monitoring, which is associated with\nlower self-care and ignoring physical health [85, 148, 149],\nto attending to their bodies in more positive ways that\nemphasize self-care. There are some interventions (e.g., selfcompassion)\nthat can enhance patients’ well-being in tandem\nwith improvements in body shame [150]. The key is for both\nhealth care professionals and patients to appreciate the extent\nto which body loathing and shame is associated with reduced\nengagement in self-care [85, 120].There is a cultural belief that\npeople have to be dissatisfied with their weight (or any aspect\nof their appearance) in order to be motivated to improve it.\nThis belief has not found general support in the literature; in\n', 'Journal of Obesity 11\nfact, the reverse is supported: people are more likely to take\ncare of their bodies when they appreciate and hold positive\nfeelings toward their bodies [133, 147, 151].\nIn order to encourage self-care behaviors, patients also\nneed to reconnect with their bodies, that is, focus on internal\nbody awareness rather than engage in external appearance\nmonitoring [85, 147, 148, 151] (see Figure 2). Internal body\nawareness is required to be able to know when something\nis “not right” with their bodies as well as attend to their\nbodies’ physical and psychological needs [147]. For example,\nawareness of hunger and satiety cues is needed to determine\nwhen and how much to eat in order to prevent under- or\novereating [148, 151]. Raising internal bodily awareness could\nbe facilitated by offering unconditional acceptance of people’s\nbodies and bodily experience in lieu of weight stigmatization.\nIndeed, women who received body acceptance by others (in\ncontrast to weight stigma) reported higher body appreciation\nand less habitual appearance monitoring [148, 151]; thus, they\nare more connected to the functionality of their bodies and\nless shameful of their bodies. Moreover, body acceptance by\nothers fully accounted for the link between women’s BMI\nand their body appreciation [151]. This finding underscores\nthe need to eradicate all health care interventions that foster\nweight stigma to improve patients’ perceptions that the health\ncare environment and health care professionals accept their\nbodies. Greater internal awareness and appreciating the body\nare related to higher eating based on physiological hunger\nand satiety cues and less situational and emotional eating\n[148, 151]—additional reasons for health care professionals to\nencourage clients to appreciate their bodies and listen to their\nbodies’ internal cues.\n3.4. A Weight-Inclusive Approach to Public Health. The current\npublic health model operates through the identification\nof risk factors and population-based efforts to reduce such\nrisks in order to prevent disease and promote health [99].\nThe reduction of risk factors occurs through various forms\nof public action, including regulatory efforts (e.g., taxing\nand legislation), community-based universal programs (e.g.,\nHealth Promoting Schools), and public health messaging\nto raise awareness of the risks and benefits associated with\ncertain behaviors (e.g., “5-a-day”). However, this model has\nbeen criticized for focusing too heavily on factors that are\nperceived to be under personal control while neglecting the\nlarger sociocultural and economic conditions that dictate\nmuch of people’s lived experiences, choices, and opportunities\n[37, 99].\nSyme pointed out that the conditions often referred to\nas “lifestyle diseases,” under which overweight and obesity\nare named, have been associated with a variety of genetic\nand environmental factors that occur well outside personal\ncontrol [99]. This lack of control is especially true for\npopulations that face most health challenges. Populations\nwith the worst health outcomes tend to also be populations\nliving under the most socioeconomic constraints and have\nthe least amount of personal control over their lives [31].\nMarmot has written extensively about the contributions of\nsocial and economic inequalities to public health issues and\nthe critical importance of considering these issues in public\nhealth policy [152]. Disregard for the environment within\nwhich people live offers “a rather decontextualized” approach\nto public health that is unlikely to be effective and may even\nbe unethical due to the potential for harm [37].\nAn approach to public health that incorporates a weightinclusive\napproach may not only circumvent the adverse\nhealth and well-being consequences linked to the weightnormative\napproach but alsomay enhance population health.\nLongitudinal studies have repeatedly shown that, irrespective\nof actual weight, body satisfaction and freedom from\nweight-based teasing and stigma are linked to reduced risk\nfor unhealthy dieting practices, sedentary behaviors, eating\ndisturbances, and weight gain among young people [95, 153,\n154]. Public health messages that are free of weight focus also\nappear to be more acceptable to the public and more likely\nto encourage healthy behaviors than messages emphasizing\nweight control or obesity prevention. For example, a large\nnationally representative U.S. survey revealed that participants\nresponded most favorably to public health messages\nthat promoted healthy behaviors without any reference to\nweight or obesity at all [155]. The survey further showed that\nmessages perceived as weight stigmatizing were negatively\nreceived and rated less likely to foster healthy behavior\nchange. The findings have since replicated in randomized\ncontrolled settings [156].\nSeveral scholars have proposed actions that may be taken\nat the policy level to prevent and reduce harm associated\nwith a weight-focused sociocultural climate [35, 157, 158].\nHowever, a serious, inbuilt resistance to change appears to\nbe present within health systems. For instance, OReilly and\nSixsmith have argued that an overreliance on the dominant\nposition of powerful institutions, such as the World Health\nOrganization, has resulted in a dead-lock situation where\npublic health authorities uncritically accept and maintain the\nweight-normative approach without scrutinizing its validity,\neffectiveness, or ethical implications [158]. Thus, the weightnormative\napproach becomes a self-perpetuated dogma. The\nindications of harm associated with this paradigm, however,\ndemand that a closer look be taken and actions to reduce\nthe focus on weight within public health be implemented.\nCertainly, during this implementation phase, data would be\nneeded to evaluate the outcomes of moving away from a\nweight-normative toward a weight-inclusive approach.\nOReilly and Sixsmith analyzed policy options that could\nbe used to shift the weight-normative approach to a more\nweight-inclusive approach in public health [158]. They conducted\ninterviews with key stakeholders who were asked\nto rank proposed policy changes in terms of estimated\neffectiveness in challenging the weight-normative approach,\nlikelihood of promoting equity and reducing weight bias,\npolitical and public acceptability, and the practicalities of\nimplementation. The policy change that received the most\nfavorable rating was adopting language that did not mention\nweight in public health messages. This was seen as a very low\ncost action with a high level of public acceptability and political\nfeasibility. The shift from a weight-normative to a weight-\ninclusive approach also emerged as a public preference in a\nrecent Canadian report where members of the community\n', '12 Journal of Obesity\nwere engaged in a discussion, in person and online, about\nfeasible action to promote healthy weight in children. The\nmost popular idea expressed online was to turn away from\na weight-normative approach in health promoting efforts as\nmany participants expressed concern with the language on\nweight and instead preferred a focus on healthy living [159].\nAs this is a policy change that can be implemented with\nrelative ease, OReilly and Sixsmith highlighted it as a viable\nand recommended action for governments to reduce harm\ncaused by weight stigma and weight preoccupation [158].\nOther promising policy options in OReilly and Sixsmith’s\nanalysis were implementing antiweight bias training for\nhealth professionals and establishing research guidelines that\nensure the inclusion of measures of possible third-factor\ncontributions to obesity research, such as socioeconomic\nstatus, physical activity, and dietary factors [158]. Several\ninterventions to reduce weight bias among preservice and\npracticing health professionals have already been reported in\nthe scientific literature with promising results [157, 160, 161].\nIn one study, over three hundred public health promoters\nwere offered a single-dayworkshop onweight bias and related\nissues which led to significant decreases in antifat prejudice,\ndecreased internalization of media stereotypes on weight and\nshape, and increased self-efficacy for addressing weight bias\nafter intervention [157].\n4. Summary of the Competing Approaches\nTheresearch demonstrates that a focus onweight is associated\nwith adverse physical health and psychological well-being\nfor patients and community members. Dieting is inextricably\nlinked to significant physiological barriers to overall physical\nhealth that likely could have been prevented. The strain of\nunsuccessful weight loss attempts on physical health is not\nconsistent with a beneficent and nonmaleficent approach to\nclinical practice and public health. Moreover, the weightnormative\napproach blames the individual rather than the\nprocess when weight loss attempts fail, which is then tied\nto body blame, body shame, internalized weight stigma,\nand decreased psychological well-being. Under the weightnormative\napproach, weight stigma likely filters into health\ncare professionals’ relationships with their patients, even if it\nis unintentional.\nThe weight-inclusive approach supports the health of\npeople across the weight continuum and challenges weight\nstigma. Data from randomized controlled trials have upheld\nthe efficacy of programs with a weight-inclusive emphasis,\nsuch as HAES. Specifically, participants following the\nHAES model achieved statistically and clinically significant\nimprovements in physiological measures (e.g., blood pressure),\nbehavioral practices (e.g., increased physical activity,\ndecreased binge eating), and psychological measures (e.g.,\nincreased self-esteem, decreased depressive symptoms) and\ndid not demonstrate any adverse outcomes, despite the fact\nthat weight remained relatively unchanged. Other research\nhas supported the weight-inclusive approach, such that living\nin a body-accepting environment (i.e., one without weight\nstigma) is associated with higher body appreciation and\nlower habitual appearance monitoring, independent of BMI.\nThe weight-inclusive approach, then, upholds the ethical\nprinciples of beneficience and nonmaleficience and can be\nused as a springboard for generating additional clinical and\npublic health interventions. Points of intervention, based\non targeting the variables that are connected to reduced\nphysical health and well-being (see Figure 2), as well as the\nmechanisms of action between the variables, are offered for\nhealth professionals who work with patients or within public\nhealth settings.\nReturning to the vignette in the Introduction, we now\nframe the health care encounter between the doctor and\npatient through the lens of weight-inclusion and well-being\ninstead of the pursuit of weight loss, taking into account how\nlittle time doctors get to spend with patients during a typical\noffice visit.\nJasmine is waiting in the exam room and her chart shows\nthat her weight today is up five pounds from her last visit\ntwo years ago, putting her BMI at 32. Her blood pressure was\nborderline high in contrast to the normal readings in previous\nvisits. Although Jasmine’s labs were normal in past visits, they\nare out of date. When Dr. Johnson greets her today, Jasmine\nseems anxious and tells Dr. Johnson, “I almost did not come\nin today knowingmyweight is up from the last time Iwas here\nand you suggested a diet. I feel like such a failure. However,\nI need help for my migraines, so here I am.” Dr. Johnson and\nJasmine look at each other, there is a beat of silence, and they\nboth sigh.\nDr. Johnson says, “You know, Jasmine, I have been\nreading the research onweight loss interventions and weightcycling\nand I’m realizing that if the same thing happens to\nalmost everyone, it probably is not the fault of the person,\nit is probably more about the process itself. So, instead of\nfocusing onweight loss, I’m encouragingmy patients to think\nabout what makes them feel better in their everyday lives;\nemotionally and physically. For example, do you feel better\nwhen you eat more fruits and vegetables, drink more water,\ntake a walk with a friend, meditate to relieve stress, and get\nenough sleep?There’s good evidence that those behaviors are\ngoing tomake youhealthier and feel better even if yourweight\ndoes not change.”\nJasmine is a bit surprised by Dr. Johnson’s shift and says,\n“Well, typically, when my weight loss slows down or stops\ncompletely, I stop doing any of those things you mentioned\nthat would help me feel better and be healthier.” Dr. Johnson\nsays, “I understand, but we’re going to turn the focus from\nyour weight to your health. Because those behaviors are\nlinked to health, why not do them anyway?”\nJasmine smiles at Dr. Johnson and says, “It sure would be\neasier to come back and see you the next time I’m supposed\nto if I did not have to lose weight first.”\nDr. Johnson replies, “I do not want anything to stand in\nthe way of you getting your medical care, including worrying\nthat I might scold you. Now that we have a better plan, I am\ngoing to have the nurse retake your blood pressure.” Jasmine\nand Dr. Johnson then discuss treatment options for Jasmine’s\nmigraines.\nRight before Dr. Johnson leaves the room, Jasmine shares\none more quick concern, “I like the shift from weight to\n', 'Journal of Obesity 13\nhealth, but there is this Weight Focusers group at work. If I\ndo not go, I’ll get charged a higher premium for my health\ninsurance.”\nDr. Johnson says, “Let me know if I can help with that.\nThe Affordable Care Act is supposed to allow you to follow\nyour doctor’s recommendation, and I have no evidence that\nWeight Focusers is going to make you healthier and lots of\nevidence that says that weight cycling is linked to poorer\nhealth.”\nJasmine leaves the doctor’s office feeling hopeful and\nunderstood.\nAs Dr. Johnson finishes the chart note, she realizes that\nher own body is relaxed, her jaw unclenched. She feels like\nshe hasmade a better connectionwith Jasmine and developed\na sustainable treatment plan she can follow. Dr. Johnson is\ncurious and maybe even a little eager to see what happens\nnext. However, she does wonder what will happen if the\nreviewers do not see weight loss in this patient, or a goal of\nweight loss in the treatment plan.\n5. Directions for Future Research\nMore research on the weight-inclusive versus weightnormative\napproach is sorely needed as many important\nquestions remain unanswered. Research into the variety of\nexpressions of weight stigma can reveal nuanced associations\nthat advance scholars’ understanding of its influence and\nexpression. For example, weight stigma could be operationalized\nas weight-related teasing, bullying, discrimination,\ncommentary, and objectification, and the source could also\nbe operationalized (e.g., partners, health care system, family,\nfriends, etc.). Similarly, decreased physical health and psychological\nwell-being can be defined in many different ways\nand these operationalizations may reveal different relationships\nwith weight and body-based variables.\nAnother alternative conceptualization would be to\nexplore what happens in the absence of weight stigma, which\nwould directly examine weight-inclusive approach. Those\nwho do not experience weight stigma (whether because of\ntheir weight or their environment/community/culture) may\ndemonstrate body appreciation and superior health and wellbeing.\nAlthough some research into positive body-accepting\nenvironments has begun [148, 151], these studies are in their\ninfancy and would benefit from additional research. In\naddition, it would be useful to know whether individuals\nwho transition out of weight-stigmatizing environments\n(e.g., away from stigmatizing partners or family members)\nreceive health and well-being related benefits (and the extent\nof these benefits) or whether memories of being stigmatized\ncontinue to influence their health and well-being at a similar\nlevel. In the latter instance, perhaps mental health providers\ncould work individually with patients to buffer internalized\nweight stigma and promote individual empowerment. In\nparticular, interventions that emphasize self-compassion\n[161] may be useful for these therapeutic endeavors, as\nempirical evidence suggests that self-compassion is an\nadaptive mindset to cultivate in the context of improving\nbody image and eating behavior [162–167]. Indeed, a 3-week\nonline self-compassion intervention reduced body shame\nand improved body appreciation in community women;\nthese women maintained these outcomes at a 3-month\nfollow-up relative to a wait-list control group [150]. Among\nwomen high in dietary restraint, those who were induced\nto think self-compassionately after eating a doughnut as\npart of the experimental task (i.e., they were told that all\npeople eat unhealthy foods at times and asked to not to be\nhard on themselves because “this little amount of food does\nnot matter anyway”) were able to reduce their distress and\ndisinhibited eating relative to a control group who did not\nreceive the self-compassion induction [167].\nThose working in patient settings and public health\nshould investigate the impact of moving from a weightnormative\napproach to a weight-inclusive approach on their\npatients and communities. Researchers could explore the\neffects on patients’ compliance and willingness to address\nhealth issues proactively when weight loss is removed from\nthe equation. Qualitative designs could be used to garner\nrich data on the challenges and benefits of this change to\nhealth care, treatment adherence (e.g., more likely go to\nfollow-up appointments for medical concerns), and overall\nhealth improvement. In addition, more research is needed\nto examine which particular components of the weightinclusive\napproach, individually or in conjunction with\nother components, have the strongest connection to health\nimprovement and promotion.\n6. Conclusion\nThe weight-normative approach is not improving health for\nthe majority of individuals across the entire weight continuum.\nWeight is overemphasized for higher-weight individ-\nuals (i.e., assumptions are made that they are unhealthy)\nand underemphasized for lower- or “average-” weight individuals\n(i.e., assumptions are made that they are healthy).\nFurthermore, we know that weight loss through dieting is not\nsustainable over time for the vast majority of higher-weight\nindividuals and is linked to harmful consequences.Therefore,\nwe argue that it is unethical to continue to prescribe weight\nloss to patients and communities as a pathway to health,\nknowing the associated outcomes—weight regain (if weight\nis even lost) and weight cycling—are connected to further\nstigmatization, poor health, and well-being. The data suggest\nthat a different approach is needed to foster physical health\nand well-being within our patients and communities.\nAdvocates of a weight-inclusive approach assert that\nwe are acting on behalf of our patients’ and communities’\ninterests when we centralize health for people at all points\nalong the weight continuum and work to eradicate weight\nstigma in all settings, including health care and public health.\nThis paper has reviewed the data in support of a weightinclusive\napproach to foster physical and psychological well-\nbeing. We encourage both scholars and practitioners to\nstudy and document what happens when health professionals\nand their target populations shift their focus to developing\nsustainable healthy behaviors for every body.\n', '14 Journal of Obesity\nConflict of Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] L.
