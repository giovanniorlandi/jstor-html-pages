Fruit growers can prevent this\ninjury and reduce tho losses caused\nby these rodents by placing com or\ntobacco stalks, newspaper or woven\nwire netting about their trees be\nfore winter arrives, specialists at the\nCollege of Agriculture say. Keep\ning orchards free from rubbish and\nweeds also has been found helpful\nin reducing tho damage dono by ro\ndents. Dcspito the fact that its original\ncost is great than that of corn or\ntobacco stalks, woven wire netting\nis tho most practical means of pro\ntecting trees since it can bo used for\nfrom five to ciglt years while the\ncorn or tobneco stalks or newspa\npers must be replaced each year. A\npiece of woven wire 18 inches high\nnnd from 18 to 24 inches long when\nbent around (he tree nnd fastened\nat the ends will sand out far enough\nto protect the tree nnd give suffici\nent room for tho tree to make sev\neral years\' growth. Tho mesh of\ntho, netting should not tyj larger than\nono inch. In case a deep snow falls,\nduring the winter tho treo may bo\nprotected by drawing up tho cylin\nder of wir0 and packing tho snow\n\'at the baso of tho tree. This isdono\nto protect tho treo from tho mice\nwhich do their work under tho crust\ned snow nnd tho rabbits which work\non top. t\nIf paper, corn or tobaccp stalks\nare used these should bo tied about\ntho trunk of the tree, tho stalks be\ning stood on end. It is necessary\nto remove these in the spring sinee\nPU I II IV IW\'LU\nMmmummimmmtmm\nIrFO COMFORT\nBet ween Lexington,\ndletown, Mt Sterling, O\'\nOWtftOSVlUC TO PARIS\nUtvt OwWvHto fa;\nmi.
