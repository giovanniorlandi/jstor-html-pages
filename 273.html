NUMBEB 44\nSTRIKERS SHOT DOWN\nTWO KILLED AND HALF A DOZEN\nWOUNDED IN CLASH WITH\nCONSTABULARY.\nGONFLICT OCCURS AT ERNEST, PA.\nMARCHING UNION MINERS SAID\nTO HAVE OPENED FIRE ON\nSTATE GUARDS.\nIndiana, Pa., June 9.The mining\ntown of Ernest, five miles from here,\nwas the scene early in the day of a\nconflict between a detail of state con\nstabulary and striking coal miners in\nwhich two strikers were killed and\nsix others wounded, one fatally.\nShortly after daylight a body of\nstrikers headed by a brass band\nmarched from Anita mines in Jeffer\nson county to receive one of the mine\nofficials from Punxsutawney. On the\nway to the station the marchers en\ncountered a detail of twelve members"\nof the state constabulary and as they\npassed a member of the band fired his\nrevolver at the troops.\nNo one was struck, but the con\nstabulary immediately retaliated with\na volley from their carbines.\nWhen the smoke cleared eight strik\ners were lying on the ground and the\nothers had fled down the hill.\nTwo of those shot were killed in\nstantly and the six others were seri\nously wounded. The latter were at\nonce removed to a hospital and the\ndead were carried to Ernest.\nAll is now quiet and no more trou\nble at this time is expected.\nThe mines at Ernest are owjied by\n*8\ni. s* A ^t^Ati\nSjgMoillii\nthe Buffalo, Rochester and PiTtsburg\nCoal and Iron company. On Aprill a\nstrike was begun and the men have\nbeen out ever since. Three weeks\nago the plant was started with nonun\nion men and a detail of the state con\nstabulary has since been guarding the\ncoal company\'s property.\nAt present about one-half of the\nregular force of 100 men are at work\nin the mine.\nLOUISIANA CAPITOL ABLAZE.\nGovernor and Legislators Fight Fire\nin Night Clothes.\nBaton Rouge, La., June 9.The sav\ning of the state capitol building from\ncomplete destruction by fire was ac\ncomplished in a spectacular manner,\nwith Governor Blanchard, assisted by\nmany Louisiana legislators, dressed in\ntheir night clothes, and by thousands\nof citizens supplementing the fire de\npartment. The fire started from de\nfective wiring near the roof of the\nsenate chamber, destroying the cap\nitol\'s eastern wing above the first\nfloor. The damage was between $50,-\n000 and $100,000. Among the valu\nables in the ruined senate chamber,\nwhere the roof fell in, was the famous\npainting, "The Battle of New Orleans,"\nsaid to have been valued at $40,000.\nGovernor Blanchard directed the work\nof saving valuable papers. The legis\nlature now being in session the senate\nwill meet in the Elks\' theater.\nThe capitol is an Imposing piece of\narchitecture on the bank of the Missis\nsippi. It was first built in 1847 and\nwas destroyed by fire during the Civil\nwar after federal troops evacuated it.\nThe present structure was erected in\n1880.\nThe Duke of Almodovar, Spanish\nminister for foreign affairs, who has\nbeen ailing for some time, has-suffered.\na relapse, the original disease being\ncomplicated by pleurisy.\nThe explosion of an oil stove a!\nSyracuse, N.

I\nJ\nIYAN AGAIN TO THE FRONT\nINDICATIONS POINT TO HIS NOM-\nINATION BY DEMOCRATS\nIN NEXT CAMPAIGN.\nWashington, June 9.William Jen\nnings Bryan\'s familiar face looms large\nin the political sky nowadays. There\nis every indication of a concerted\nmovement to put him to the front now,\ntwo years in advance of the national\nconvention, and thus head off all pos\nsible candidates and combinations\nwhich otherwise might cross his path.\nThe Democratic managers here be\nlieve Bryan\'s nomination for president\ncan be prevented only by his death or\nby one of those strange happenings\nwhich now and then dislocate the\nplans of political leaders.\nIt is an extraordinary thing for any\nbody to have the solemn pledges of a\nnumber of strong states so long ahead.\nIt frequently happens that a president\nwho actually is in power is endorsed\nfor renomination in the middle of his\nterm.\nBut in Bryan\'s case one Democratic\nstate convention after another has not\nonly paid him complimentary attention\nbut has pledged him the delegates in\nadvance and has done it in such a way\nas to make the pledge practically a\npart of the platform.\nMINERS DISAPPOINTED.\nExpected a Settlement of Coai Strike\nin Ohio. i\nDillonvale, O., June 0.The miners\nin this district are a disappointed lot\nsince the adjournment of the Colum\nbus joint convention without an agree\nment. With a great many of them in\nstraitened circumstances and no\nfunds in their treasury it is doubtful\nif thejr\nwill remain out much longer.\nPreparations are being made by the\nRoby Coal company at Ramsey and\nRobyville and by the M. A. Hanna\ncompany at Dillonvale to resume op\nerations. Both claim to have pledges\nfrom a sufficient number of their strik\ning employes to resume work.\nOnly a few men are working at\nPlum Run. The imported men do not\nremain more than a few days and this\nproves a great handicap to the mine\nofficials. The strikers are peacable.\nASKS FOR AND GETS THE LIMIT.\nLouisiana Man Requests Judge to Give\nHim Maximum Penalty.\nChicago, June 9.John H. Dalton,\nformerly a local politician, and Lewis\nA. Gourdain of Louisiana have been\nsentenced in the United States dis\ntrict court to four and a half years in\nthe penitentiary and to pay a fine of\n$1,500 each for using the mails to de\nfraud. The charge against the men\nis that they sold options on oil lots in\nLouisiana, which did not exist. Gour\ndain when sentenced asked the court\nto give him the limit of imprisonment\nunder the law, and Judge Landis ac\ncommodated him. Gourdain previous\nly declared that if convicted he would\nask the court for the extreme sen\ntence, serve his time and then ex\nterminate his family.\nMANY PASSENGERS INJURED.\nRock Island Train Wrecked Near Jen\nnings, Kan.\nNorton, Kan., June 9.Eastbound\npassenger train No. 6 on the Chicago,\nRock Island and Pacific railway was\nwrecked near Jennings, thirty miles\nwest of here. The engine and all of\nthe coaches save one were derailed.\nEighteen or twenty passengers are re\nported seriously injured.\nRecommends Radical Changes.\nMilwaukee, June 8.Health Commis\nsioner Bading has visited several\nslaughter and packinghouses and in\nspected the sanitary arrangements\nfrom cellar to attic. Several radical\nchanges will be recommended and\nsome will be demanded as a result of\nhis discovery.\nREYNOLDS ON THE STAND.\nSubstantiates Mr. Neill\'s Testimony on\nPackinghouse Conditions.\nWashington, June 9.James B.\nReynolds, the co-author with Mr. Neill\nof the beef report, was questioned by\nthe house committee on agriculture in\ncontinuation of its beef inspection\nhearings. Referring to Mr. Neill\'s tes\ntimony Mr. Reynolds said there was\nnothing in it he wished to modify. In\nparticular he wished to substantiate\nMr. Neill regarding the shoveling of\npieces of meat from the floor of the\nNelson Morris company. He saw the\noperation.\nAt this point Chairman Wadsworth\nmade a somewhat heated statement\nsetting forth his reasons for question\ning Mr. Neill the previous day and he\nsaid he should feel free to question\nthe present witness.\n"I may be called a friend of the\npackers," he said. "I am a friend of\nthe packers and a friend of all other\nAmerican industries. I don\'t believe\nin fouling our own American nest.\nThis report has cost the agricultural\ninterests of this country millions and\nmillions of dollars and if our foreign\nmarket decreases in the next two\nweeks as it has in the past two weeks\nthe value of American live stock will\ndecrease anywhere from 30 to 50 per\ncent." i-\nScore of Strikers Killed.\nTsaritsin, Russia, June 9.In a fight\nhere between Persians, whom local\ncontractors had imported to take the\nplaces of striking longshoremen, and\n& mob of strikers a score of the latter\nBEMDJ1, MINNESOTA. SATURDAY, JUNE 9, 1906.\nWITH FEVERISH HASTE\n""i\'""\'.,:\nCHICAGO PACKERS WORK OVER-\nTIME TO IMPROVE CONDI.\nTIONS AT PLANTS.\nLETTER TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE\nPRESIDENT INCLUDES COMMU-\nNICATION FROM "TRUST-\nWORTHY WITNESS."\nWashington, June 9.In response\nto a request from the house committee\non agriculture President Roosevelt has\nforwarded to Representative Wads\nworth, the chairman of that commit\ntee, the report made to him by a com\nmittee of the department of agricul\nture regarding conditions in the Chi\ncago meat packinghouses. Accom\npanying the report was a letter from\nthe president in which he. points out\nthat there is no conflict in substance\nbetween the Neill-Reynolds report and\nthat of the agricultural department\nexperts. .The president quotes a letter\nreceived "from a, moat competent\nand trustworthy witness at Chicago"\nthat the packinghouse proprietors are\nmanifesting almost & "humorous haste\nto clean up, repave and even to plan\nfor future changes."-. New toilet rooms\nare being provided, with additional\ndressingrooms and.clean towels. The\npresident\'s correspondent says that\n"the haste toward reform would have\nbeen amusing if it^ere not so nearly\ntragic." jjt\nThe president fays his Investiga\ntions have not been completed, but\nthat "enough has |een developed in\nmy judgment to Qftll for immediate,\nthorough going and radical enlarg\ntnent of the powers:pf the government\nIn inspecting all meats which enter\nInto interstate ahdforeign commerce."\nIncluded in the president\'s communi\ncation was the following letter, dated\nJune 1, from a "competent and most\ntrustworthy witness, whose name I\nwill give to the committee If it so de\nsires:" -r-\n"On Monday I began a tour of all\nIhe great packinghouses, going first to\nLibby\'s and then to Swift\'s.\n"Tuesday all the mOrhing discussed\nchanges that ought to\nbe made and\ncaught a glimpse of the awakening at\nArmour\'s. In the afternoon visited the\nplant with, the superintendent.\nAwakening of Packingtown.\n"Wednesday I rested and contem\nplated the \'awakening of Packing-\ntown.\' It is miraculous. Thursday did\nNelson Morris with the superintend\nent. Nelson Morris has done much to\nmake things better. By the time the\nnext inspecting party arrives they will\nhave still more new lavatories, toilet\nrooms, dressingrooms, etc. Cuspidors\neverywhere and signs prohibiting spit\nting. In most the awakening seemed\nto come by force from without. There\nwas the slightest indication that the\n\'still small voice\' was at work also.\n"I made no pretense of making an\ninvestigation, but frankly announced\nmy desire to see things for myself\nand to get a fresh impression of con\nditions, as I had not seen the plants\nsince before the strike. At Armour\'s\nthere was indication of an almost hu\nmorous haste to clean up, repave and\neven to plan for future changes. Brand\nnew toiletrooms, new dressingrooms,\naew towels, etc., etc. Swift\'s and Ar\nmour\'s were both so cleaned up that I.\nwas compelled to cheer them on their\nway by expressing my pleasure at the\nchanges. The sausage girls were\nmoved upstairs, where they could get\nBun and light. They, too, have dress\ningrooms, etc. I asked for showers\nand lockers for the casing workers at\nArmour\'s and got a promise that they\nwould put them in. At Libby\'s the\ngirls are to"be put into a blue calico\nuniform, which they will buy at half\nprice. They are putting in toiletrooms\nwhich they say are temporary and\nthat when the building is remodeled\nthey will have these put in a better\nplace. The haste towards reform\nwould have been amusing if it were\nnot so nearly tragic.\n"They tried to win my help on ttte\nground that loss of foreign trade would\nmean hardship for the workers in my\nneighborhood and I must say I do\nshare this fear, but I cannot see the\nwisdom of my coming out publicly\nand saying that I saw indications of\nan awakening, for I want the changes\nto be radical and permanent, even\nthough we all have to suffer for the\npresent."\nDISMISSED BY CASSATT.\nClerk Who Accumulated Fortune on\nSmall Salary.\nPhiladelphia, June 9.Joseph K.\nAikens, chief clerk to the superintend\nent of the Monbngahela division of the\nPennsylvania railroad, has been dis\nmissed by direction of President Cas\neatt. Before the interstate commerce\ncommission Thursday Aikens said\nthat while his salary had averaged be\ntween $30 and $125 a month he owned\nnearly *$75,000 worth of coal stock. He\nadmitted having received checks from\ncoal companies and also gifts from\ncompany stores.\nHalf a Dozen Persons Injured.\nLawton, Okla., June 9.Fire de\nstroyed the Palace hotel at Waurika,\nComanche county, near here, causing\na loss of^$50,0P0.

The dead are:\nTerance Fleming, William Bailey,\nMike Gabriage, Thomas Skelley, Al\nMcFale, Matt Reikka, Roy Carey and\nJoe Bracey.\nWhen the dead body of Bailey was i\nremoved from the mine his aged\nmother died from the shock.\nThe fire which caused the trouble\nstarted in incline No. 6. This was be\nlieved to be under control and a res\ncue party started down No. 6 incline.\nWhen they reached a depth of 1,200\nfeet all were overcome.

The workmen of the fac\ntories and mills are being systemat\nically armed with Mauser rifles and\ndrilled under the supervision of army\nreserve soldiers. In spite of the re\npressive measures adopted by the au\nthorities revolutionary meetings are\nheld nightly in the industrial sections.\nThe leaders appear confident that the\nmorale of the troops of the garrison\nis undermined, as they have received\nfrom some regiments promises of sup\nport in the event of a conflict. Revo\nlutionary emissaries have been sent\nout in all directions into the country\nto incite the land hungry peasants to\nappropriate land and strike on the big\nestates The plan evidently is to se\ncure unity of action in the country\nand cities and inaugurate a conflict\nwith a general strike. The leaders evi\ndently hope for a complete rupture\nbetween the government and parlia\nment, which would furnish the neces\nsary opportunity for an uprising.

There was organized in Paris\nyears ago a society for the culture of\nsilence. On the occasion of the initia\ntion of a distinguished man of letters a\nbowl of water was brought out to him\nin a room where he was wailing in\nsolitude. He studied it a moment,\nplaced a rose upon it and sent it back.\nThe water bore the rose without over\nflowing. To the members assembled in\nanother room the act was the most\nconvincing evidence that the initiate\ncomprehended the purpose of the fel\nlowship and was prepared in spirit to\nbecome one of the company. The act\nwas a symbol which Americans may\nwisely study.Good Health.\nEnglish Railways and Fogs*\nIt is seldom that there is a sufficient\nly heavy fog on an American railway\nto cause serious inconvenience that no\nspecial precautions are taken, but in\nEngland a heavy fog is so common\nthat there is a regular service made up\nof the repair gangs, who take the place\nof the mechanical signals. Every dis\ntance signal is guarded by a signal\nman, who is supplied with flags and\ntorpedoes, the latter being called de\ntonators, while "the signal men are\npointsmen. Two torpedoes are placed\non the track to warn the engineer when\nthe signal is set at danger and are sup\nplemented by a red lantern in the\nhands of the signal man. As the tor\npedoes cost a cent and a half each and\nare used in great numbers there is a\nmachine supplied by which the second\ntorpedo is forced from the rail by the\nforce of the explosion ,of the first, as\nonly one is necessary, the second being\nmerely a precaution.\nHer Quick Wit.\nHeYour new hat is charming, but I\nfancy it doesn\'t go well with that\ndress.
