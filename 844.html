It is\nreported here on good authority that\nthe President has called a conference\nof several New Mexico men interested\nia the selection of the successor to\nGeorge Curry, governor of New Mex\nico, and that a number of well known\nNew Mexicans are now en route to\nthe capital.\nJudge Ira A. Abbott, a member of\nthe iNew Mexico supreme court, who\netands particularly well wit a the pres\nident, the department of justice and\nSecretary Ballinger of the Interior de\npartment, it Is slated, has been sum\nmoned to Washington to participate\nIn the conference which will take\nplace this wek. The names of the\nothers who -will likely take part In\nthe conference have not been made\npublic, but it is said they are for the\nmost part Republicans who have not\nbeen overly active in some of the re\ncent political transactions in New\nMexico.\nIt is tven a matter of gossip that\nJudge Abbott will be tendered the of\nfice of governor upon his arrival here,\nalthough friends of the Jurist in the\ncapital pay positively that he does\nnot want the Job.\nIt Is understood that Nathan Jaffa,\nwho Is now territorial -secretary, is\nalso to be brought forward for the\noffice.\nSo far as is known here, the presi\ndent has not Indicated who be favors\nif he has any one definitely in mind\nfor the position, but It is shown that\nhe intends to take up the matter dur\ning the present week witu a view to\nmaking the -appointment. probably\nearly in -Deceaiber, so that the new\nappointee can be confirmed by the\nsenate immediately upon the conven\ning of congress.\nCaught \'Em Napping.\nThere Is a story in circulation here\nto the effect that the rather sudden\nresignation of Governor Curry caught\nthe party leaders In New Mexico nap\nping to the extent that they had not\nagreed upon his successor and that\n. Instead of being able to present a u\nnlted front o the endorsement of one\nman for the position, they have as\nmany candidates as there are coun\nties in the territory, which greatly\nlessen j their chances of securing any\none of the lot.\nAmong the well informed who take\nany Interest in New Mexico affairs it\nIs the concensus of opinion that the\nnext governor of New Mexico will be\na compromise candidate who will be\nentirely acceptable to Mr. Taft and\nSecretary iBallinger and not too ab\nnoxlous to the New Mexico politi\ncians, who apparently do not - know\nJust who they want.\nIt ! an open secret that a Pennsyl\nvania man would be acceptable to the\nLET US SHOW YOU THE\nBEST INVESTMENT in City Property, the\nNEW LEA\'S SUB-DIVISION.\na i-a to 5 Blocks from Post Office.\nOment Sidewalks.

"Bull" And\nrews, but there is at present no like\nlihood that a Pennsylvania- man will\neven be mentioned la connection\nwith the appointment.\nAn amusing feature of the present\nsituation is the number of letters and\ncharges that have been brought to\nthe attention of the interior depart\nment. These concern a large number\nof men who have been mentioned in\nNew Mexico in connection with the\noffice of governor, but some of whom\nhave never been brought to the atten\ntion of the department before atv.I are\neven unknown to Secretary Ballinger.\nIt is said by those who profess to\nknow ail about it. that the president\'s\nobject iu taking up the matter at this\ntime is to shut off the flood of candi\ndates who are already seeking the of\nfice and to save further complica\ntions in an already badly muddled\nslate of affairs.\nIt is pretty well known that who\never is named to succeed Curry wffc\nbe eminently satisfactory to ..Mr. TJf;\nand Mr. Ballinger. whether or not the\nnew governor is pleasing to the New\nMexico politicians.\nThe Statehood Situation.\nWith the convening of congress on\nly a few weeks distant, there is not\nnvic-h of an encouraging nature in\nthe statehood situation. Everything\nindicates that the same fight which\nhas resulted in the defeat of the state\nhood bill In the past will be made a\ngaln and that if s\'atehood is secured\nat the coming session it will be in the\nnature of an accident.\nQuiet investigations which have\nbeen made during the summer into\nthe political affairs of the territory\nhave not tended to help New Mexi\nco\'s chances for admission and it is\nunderstood that the visit of Mr. Tnfr\nto the territory on his recent toir did\nnot materially aid the statehood\ncansa. However, it Is a tow weks too\nearly to definitely outline what the\nnature of the opposition will be.

LIVES\nCherry, Ills., Nov. 17. A new disas\nter today threatens the St. Paul mine\nand endangers the lives of those\nworking near the mouth of the shaft.\nIt couie from the tons of water which\nhave been forced down the burning\nmine. There are indications that gas\nis forming and should this bocom\ngcnural and the gas explode the lives\nof ilte men at the top would be in\ngrave danger.\nIn an effort to rid the mine of this\ngas tne air shaft will bo opened today\nand the big fan started.\nClikf lloran and his band of fire\nmen from Chicago stopped puciping\nwater into the shaft early today, as\nthe water is evidently failing to reach\nthe tlainea, which are fiercest in the\ngalleries Instead of in the shaft. The\nfire is r.ov holier than at any iLne.\nState troops arrived during the\nnifcht and are guarding the mine prop-\nj er:y, but there have been no evidences\nj of trouble today, although yesterday\nthreats were made against Rosenjack,\nthe eager, who was accused of desert\ning \'his post.\nT\'.iei-e were wild rumors last night\ntha: the Pullman cars in which Pres\nident Earling ar.d o her mine officials\nwore sleeping, would be dynamited.\nThe temperature of the main shaft\nwas tested this morning, showing 115\ndegrees, indicating the intensity of\nthe fires. During the taking of the test\na pathetic appeal from the women of\nCherry for the opening of the shaft,\nforced the officials to -turn their heads\nIn sorrow. With the soldiers standing\nby, one woman rushed upon the sand\ncovering the top of the shaft and\nthrew herself upon the earth, sobbing\n"Open the shaft! open the shaft!"\nHer cries and hysterical efforts to re\nsist the attempts of the men to take\nhir away attracted attention front all\never the mine enclosure. "Open the\nshaft!" she screamed, "my father was\ndown in a mine once and he came out\nalive, and I know my husband and\nbrother are not dead." This is typical\nof the feeling all over Cherry today\nand the authorities realizing it will\ndo all in their power to open the\nmine.\nThe Kansas City Stock Market.\nKansas City, Mo., Nov. 17.

Iron, alumin\num, sulphur, silicon, chlorine, calcium.\npotassium, phospuorus and nitrogen\nare plant food elements used by all\nplants, and derived by them from the\nsoil on which they are grown. If a\nsoil contains an abundance of tSves\nelements in a form available to plants\nit is in tbe highest possible degree of\nfertility. Too much of some of the el\nements is, however, under certain\nconditions even more injurious to\ncrops than a scarcity. An excess of\nsalts of sodium potassium and (magne\nsium for example causes "alkali"\nsoils. By analysis of the various\nplants the chemist can determine the\namount of each of the elements they\ncontain, and calculate the amount re\nmoved from an acre of soil by each\ncrop. In this way It should be possi\nble to determine by an analysis or a\nsoil whether or not K is in need of\nany of the plant food elements for a\nspecial crop, when the amount found\nin an acre of the soil is calculated to\nthe tiepth at which the plant usually\nfeeds. An examination of this kind\nwill show any soil to contain far more\nthau the amount of plant food neces\nsary for one year. This Is a very nec\nessary state otherwise a soil would\nfce exhausted by one year\'s cropping.\nThe elements are conserved in the\nsoil by being In an insoluble form and\nnot available to the plant, only small\namounts being rendered available\nfrom year to year through raturai a\ngencies. In some soils there is not a\n-umcient amount of all the elements\nconverted into an available form for\none year\'s cropping. Such soils are In\nnted of fertilizers. Analyses of many\nsoils, together with fertilizer experi\nments, indicate that all of the ele\nments of plant food .mentioned above\noccur In abaundance, and in an avail\nable for.ti, in nearly all soils except\ncalcium, potassium, phosphorous and\nnitrogen. In many soils an application\n(f these in a form available to plants\nwill increase the crop yield. A study\nof New Mexico soils, and the waters\nivith which they are irrigated, shows\nthat they usually contain an abund\nance of all the elements except phos\nphorous and nitrogen. The amount of\nthese is nearly always small, and\n\'heir application to the soil. In the ex\nperiments -that have been conducted,\n.-how that they are ofi?n needed by\nour crops. They are especially needed\nin an organic form, which has the ad\nditional advantage of adding some\nmuch needed humus. An economical\nand desirable source for both ele\nments I stable manure and bat gua\nno. The chemist has no means of\nmeasuring the exact amount of avail\nable plant food in a soil, and his\nanalysis may be of little value in de\ntermining the Immediate crop produc\ning power of a soil. Indeed without\nmaking a number of analysis of each\nsoil type from every locality tss\nchemist can tell little about "toe fer\ntility of the soil. This would be a long\nand tedious operation and makes it\nimpossible for the station to under\ntake work of this character free of\ncharge for the individual. For those\nwho desire to have this work done\nhere a fee of $1.00 will be charged for\neach complete agricultural analysis\nto partly cover its cost.\nThe chemist cannot tell the farmer\nti.e exact amount of the various ele\nments that would constitute an excess\nand result In Injury to his crop, since\nthis depends upon the character of\nsoil, drainage, crop, etc.; but knowing\nthese conditions he can advise, ftf\nleast within rather wide limits, and\noften 8tigg(st a remedy. Work of this\ncharacter will be undertaken free of\nrharge for citizens of New Mexico.\nThose desiring soil analysis made\nat thi3 station should first write the\nchemist concerning Instructions for\ntaking samples. ,\nR.

In order\nto be in the swim the auto manufac\nturers have concluded that "joy-riding"\nis a luxury and should be pari\nfor accordingly. Hence up go the\nprices according to the following from\nthe Oklahoma City Times:\n"Wise men whose eyesight Is keen\nenough to follow the swift flight of\nautomobile trade predict a raise in the\nprices of these "joy wagons" soon.\nThe announcement Is a severe disap\npointment, for we were noting with\njoy the decrease in auto prices during\nthe past few years and were fondly\nexpecting that the price would soon\nbe low enough to permit us to invest\na week\'s salary, buy an automobile\nand "break our neck."\nAutomobile manufacturers say It\'s\nnot their fault that tbe price is rais\ning. They say that the price of raw\nmaterial is higher.\n\'They declare that the advance Is\nIn the neighborhood of 30 per cent,\nand that they can not dispense with\nthe purchase of raw materials and re\nmain in the business.\n"But the "raw material man" says\ntXa It is not bis fault that the price\nof raw ma erial is to be higher. He\nsays that the demand for automobiles\nhas grown overwhelmingly large, and\nthat there Is but little more material\nleft. Therefore It\'s growing dearer.\nEarly last spring when the esti\nmates for the 1910 crop of automo\nbiles was summed up the manufactur\ners estimated that about 75.000 cars\nwould be needed to satiate the desire\nof Americans to travel faster. JVc\ncordlnsry the manufacturers went to\nwork to make the maefclnas.\n"Bat a change has come. Tbe man\nufacturers underestimated the Ameri\ncan desire for automobiles, and now it\nJAS. E.

Likewise It main\ntains the fertility of soils naturally\nrich in plant food, and if used as a\nbase of rotation makes possible abun\ndant crop yields of various kinds.\nNotwithstanding its present impor\ntance and great value in irrigation\nfarming, the profits on the area now\nin alfalfa can be greatly increased if\nmore care and skill are exercised in\ngrowing it.\nPerhaps the most essential eondi\nlions for the production of alfalfa are\nabundant sunsnine, a higa summer\ntemperature, sufficient moisture, and\na rich, deep well-drained soil. All\nof these esesntlals. save moisture, ex\nist naturally in the arid region of the\nI\'nited States, and when wa\'er is sup\nplied it makes the condition ideal. Al\nthough alfalfa can be successfully\nTrown under a wide range of soil con\niitions, yet all western lands are not\nqually well adapted to its growth.\nHow to determine the suitability\nf land for growing alfalfa under ir\nrigation, as well as how to prepare\nthe land, is told in Farmers\' Bulletin\n:573, "Irrigation of Alfalfa." recently\nIssued by the IT.

Imov. iv. -itn bottled wa\nter sale j in Chicago which were given\na black eye when Kie tap arlnk from\nold Lake Michigan vat championed\nby no lesa an auij.rit tiiau Wiutel\nStatea Food Commissioner Wiley,\nhave reached the magnitude of mil\nlion of gallons annually. So long\nhas the lake waxef- puspage been In\ndisrepute because of the one-Unite con\ntamination which the Drainage canal\nlargely cured by turning the sewerage\ntoward the gulf jthat crystal water\nthat has been bottled at the end of\npipe-lines a hundred miles long, at\nany rural spring or from the lake it\nself has found ready sale. But br\nisi what Dr. Wiley said: "There are\npeople who think they cannot drink\nanything but bottled water and they\ndo not realize that the great expanse\nof water In Lake Michigan, with Its\nstill greater depth, has more power to\ncleanse itself from germs and debris\nthan has the little well or sink hole\nwhere many of the bottled waters\ncome from." Occasionally some tem\nporary anxiety has been given , the\nbottlers by publicity of discoveries\nthat the trusting patrons of some\nbrand of "aqua pur a" have been con\nsuming the same limpid fluid that\nthey would have got from their kitch\nen tap. But In general the water\nbottling industry under the Impulse\nof germ-fearing sentiment, -has run as\nsmoothly as the brewers\' before the\nprohibition crusade took a hold. And\ntheir profits have been larger than\nthe brewers\' because they were at no\npains to do more than run their wares\nthrough a distilling apparatus which\nmight or might not purify It.\n-\nVen the late Ransom R. Cable\nwas one of the "Big Tour" of the rail\nroads of the West, .with Marvin Hugh\nlit, president of the Chicago &, North\nwestern, Potter of the Burlington and\nMcMillen of the Alton, he became\nknown as such a marvel of omniscient\nenergy that \'his subordinates never\nfor a moment suspected that anyone\nbut Cable was running the Rock Is\nland railroad. So, when Mr. Cable\npassed the title of president on to VV.\nCJ. Purdy and became chairman of the\nboard of directors when one of the of\nficials was asked if Cable was going\nto retire, he answered like a flash:\n"Oh, no, he is assuming the duties Of\nchairman of the board in addiUon to\neverything else down to office boy.\nIt has been generally conceded that\nfrom the time lie became general\nmanager In 1883 until about nine\nyears ago, Mr. Cable fixed the policy\nof the railroad and saw that every\nbody carried it out. He rarely asked\nfor suggestions from subordinates,\nand never brooked opposition. When\nReid, Leed3. the Moores and their as\nsociates secured control of the Rook\nIsland ten years ago, Mr. Cable want\ned to retire. \'He was urged to reraadn\nand practically run the road, but in\n1903 he handed in his resignation as\nchairman. He remained on the direc\ntorate. ...\nThe disbursement of $11,500,000 of\nChicago\'s cash in the department of\npubHc works is by a system garland\ned with the Utopian trust. If one judge\nby explanations of It elicited In the\ninquiry tnto the signing of certain\nvouchers for over $45,000. About the\nItcena of those particular vouchers\nthe department chiefs whose signa\ntures were affixed say they Inquired\nnot at all . For the sum expended In\nthis Instance the city seems to have\nreceived nothing, but If It did. it is\nnot due to the commissioner, whose!\nsalary ts $10,000, or to bla deputy for\ndaily they\' sign stacks of (vouchers\nwitli rarely a look at the items Involv\ned, they have said. These Touchers\nare brought to one or the other dated\nand stamped and awaiting, only their\nsignature to make tbecn ready for the\nfinal signature of the city comptrol\nler. Explanatory matter attached Is\ncarefully folded up out of the way,\nso that It will not Interfere with the\nImportant formality of signlgg, and\nwould never be seen. .No one it seems\nis responsible for knowing that the\nvouchers should be signed, in the in\nquiry concerning that unfortunate\n$5,000 disbursement it has been found\nthat originals of letters dealing with\nthe case were found to tare been de\ntached from rhe original estimate and\noriginal \'voucher somewhere between\nthe public works department and the\ncomptroller\'s office. The official fas\ntener was missing and the remaining\ndocuments fastened only with a pin.\n1N0 audit Is made of the municipal\naccounts of 90 per cent of the cKies\nand towns of the middle west, it ap\npears, although the example set by\nChicago eome years ago under com\npulsion from business .men and the\ndisclosures 4hat followed has spurrej\nmunicipalities to follow the big cor\nporations in this matter. It is the\nexception now to And no audit maie\nof corporate accounts, both for the\nprotection of the stockholders and of\nthe officials who are responsible for\nthe cash. Although $120,000 was the\ncost of the (memorable audit in Chica\ngo, tha reforms which were institut\ned have repaid the city many timae.\nIn the cases where municipalities\nhave done the same thing the experts\nhave usually made discoveries or\npointed out ways of saving which\nhave far more than paid their bills.\nIn one small city it is stated that the\naccountant found over 1,000 errors in\nthe records of four years. Henry B.\nHudson and Fred W. Wright, Chicago\naccountants who specialize on cnuni\ncipal accounts are authority for the\nstatement that no city which annual\nly collects $100,000 fails to save mon\ney when an audit Is regularly made.\n"Politics is the governing reason why\nmore audits of municipal affairs are\nnot made, of course," Mr. Hudson\nhas said. "The administration usual\nly does not like to have an expert cal\nled in because they fear the audiit will\nbe misconstrued to Its disadvantage.\nBut as a matter of experience this U\nnot the result; the faithful guardians\nof public trust are enabled by an au\ndit to have due appreciation given\ntheir services."\nFifty million Christmas stamps for\nthe American Red Cross Society\'s\nwarfare on tuberculosis have been di\nstributed Cor sale at a cent each, sev\neral million being assigned, to Chica\ngo, twice aa many to Mew York and\na proportionate .number to other cities\nfrom which stare Red Cross societies\nsend them as c tiered to towns and\nvillages. "Every etamp a bullet In\nthe war on the -white plague," Is the\nslogan used in the West and bullets\nof this kind are already adorning mail\npackages on closet shelves for Christ\nmas giving and letter beads of some\ncorporations. In Illinois each year\nthe white plague claims some 8,000\nvictims, for which reason society, bus\niness and charity have made the use\nof Red Cross Stamps quite "the\ntiling." Bach State is assigned a pro\nper distributing agent, the Illinois\nbranch of the Rer Cross narving dele\ngated the Chicago Tuberculosis Insti\ntute, 158 Adams Street, Chicago. The\nproceeds from the sale of the stamps\noutside of Chicago are to be used Jn\nstate anti-tuberculosis exhibit which\ncan be sent Into every large town in\nthe state.
