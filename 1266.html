The gov\nernment has raided the Western Union\noffices, in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New\nYork, Washington and Boston for evi\ndence that the company is competing\nwith the postoffice by sending night let\nters via the railroad. Postoffice\nspectors have already arrested five\nWestern Union messengers and the in\nspectors state the messengers carried\nquantities of messages dated yesterday\nand prepared as if they had been trans\nmitted via wire. Postoffice officials said\nthey would charge that the company de\nfrauded the public and had infringed on\nthe government monopoly of carrying\nfirst class mail. It is assumed that the\nin- same thing has been done throughout\nthe country. Other investigations are\nnow proceeding.\nIt has been stated that the office of\ncounty commissioner, heretofore occu\npied by James G. Wiley, will be declar\ned vacant at the next meeting of the\nboard of county commissioners, to be\nheld on July 5th, and that Governor\nBoyle will be asked to name a new\nmember in his place.\nWiley left here on March 15th, over\nthree months ago for San Diego, and it\nis understood he has taken up perma\nnent residence there.\nTo succeed Wiley the name of Pete\nCrow has been suggested and it has\nbeen stated that a meeting of the Dem\nocratic county central committee was\nheld a few nights ago atwhich time\nCrow was endorsed for the position.\nV\' f 8tM tkm KaJssr\nGeorge xSanford has returned to this\ncity from a professional visit to San\nFrancisco.\niaiinlitays Pay Kct:3 to Sfcis xrJ\nSip Krj In ills FrOiMXfi!\nanl Kilgore, air postman, had to battle\nwith the elements for his life on the\ntrip he made yesterday afternoon from\nPhiladelphia to Washington, according\nto his report on arrival here.\nThe machine was enveloped in a vio\nlent electrical storm, which lifted its\nhead so lhat it pointed almost directly\nupward, and even drove the machine\nbackward in spite of its powerful en\ngine.\nThe storm broke shortly after Lieu\ntenant Kilgore left Bustleton field,\nWest Philadelphia. Kilgore was flying\nat an altitude of 3,500 feet. Seeking to\nget above the storm he rose to 6,000\nfeet and then to 7,000, but the higher he\nascended the more terrific was th\nstorm. -\nKeeping the nose of his machine in\nthe teeth of the gale, the airman sue\ncessfully fought his way to Havre de\nGrace, Md. The vortex of the storm\nstruck him about midway. Incessant\nflashes of lightning, accompanied by\ncontinuous roars of deafening thunder,\nencircled the plane, which, according to\nthe flier, was tossed about like a leaf.\nFirst the machine would be swerved\naround with a jerk, and then as the\npilot would force it back into the proper\ndirection, a stronger gust would stand\nit up on its tail. To the pilot the land\nscape appeared to be rapidly moving\nhe was being driven backward by the\nstronger force of the wind over the\npower of his motor.\nHis supply of thirty-two gallons of\ngasoline became exhausted as he came\nin sight of Havre de Grace. By skill\nful maneuvering, he managed to bring\nthe machine to a safe landing. The trip\nto Washington was resumed after the\nworst of the storm was over.\nThe average speed for the trip was\nheld down to thirty-one miles an hour.\nStan the Kaiser\nELKS WILL PLAT GAME\nWITH TEAM FROM PRISON\nBy Frank J. Taylor, United Press\nstaff correspondent -\nWITH THE AMERICAN EXPE\nDITIONARY FORCES AT THE\nFRONT, May 28., by mail With char\nacteristic French appreciation the Stars\nand Stripes have been placed in a posi\ntion of honor in the church of the little\nvillage of Domremy, home of Joan of\nArc\nAcross from the . iron-fenced yard\nwith the tall evergreen trees and the\ntiny house once the home of Joan of\nArc, is the old church in which Joan\nused to worship and give , thanks-\' for\nFrance\'s successes. In it are the flags\nof the principal Allied nations. -\nBut there is one place different from\nthe ordinary flag hangings on the col\numns of the old church. It is a sort of\nspecial altar in one corner sacred \'to the\nmemory of Joan of Arc. To the left as\nyou face this altar is a bright new\nAmerican Stars and Stripes, while to\nthe right is the, flag of France with the\nfigure of Joan oifiier black horse en\ngraved on the white bar of the tri\ncolor. There are many tri-colors in\nFrance, naturally, but this seems the\nonly one on which an additional figure\nis\' allowed. -\nAnother bright American nag is tn\nthe beautiful church on the hillside\nback of sleepy Domremy in which Joan\nsaw her visions. Domremy is on one.\nof the main roads back of the American\nsector, and never a day passes without\nmany doughboys and officers stopping\nto visit the home of Joan of Arc and\nthe churches in which she was inspired.\nThe simple old French woman, a di\nrect descendant of the family of Joan\nof Arc, whose husband is keeper of the\nplace in times of peace, does her best\nto explain things to the Americans. She\nis sorry she cannot speak English, she\ntells you, but she is "too old to learn it\nnow."

They had been there but a few days taking the\nbaths and enhaling the steam when they discovered that their con\nditions were improved to an extent that was marvelous and in a very\nshort time the men were pronounced cured. The attention of the\ngovernment was called to the remarkable recovery and an investiga\ntion followed, and it is stated that a bill has been introduced in con\ngress by Representative William Kettner providing that the govern\nment take over the springs and establish a big convalescent camp\nthere.\nComing from Southern California papers it may be that the story\nabove related possesses a certain amount of that "bull" for which\nthe Golden state is famous, but it should not be passed over too light\nly, for the reason that if the waters and steam of Arrowhead contain\nsuch health-giving qualities there are springs in this section of Ne\nvada that possess similar constituents, and if the California springs\nwill cure gas victims Nevada springs will do the\' same.\nAnd acting on the cue that comes from California the university\nfolks should get busy and make some investigations regarding the\nefficiency and curative qualities of the Steamboat, the Carson and\nthe Walley hot springs. They may possess elixirs heretofore undream\ned of. It is worth the experiment, anyway.\nA WAY TO QUIT SPENDING MONEY\nPerhaps for the present, like thousands of others, you are living\nbeyond your means and still have not the backbone to admit it to the\nones with whom you associate by cutting out foolish expenditures or\nby saying flatly: "I cannot afford this or that."\nIf you need some excuse to get out of the extravagance of your\ncrowd, why don\'t you refuse on the grounds of putting your money\ninto Liberty bonds or Thrift stamps and then make your word good\nby calling your own bluff?\nThink of this matter a moment.\nWould this plan not offer you absolution of the problem which\nhas troubled you so much and make it possible for you to save some\nmoney without making the admission that you cannot afford the ex\npensive ways you have been following!\nAfter you have become an investor in government securities you\nwill get enough courage to stand up in broad daylight and tell the\nunvarnished fact that you prefer to save for Uncle Sam rather than\nlead a. selfish hand-to-mouth life dodging creditors and your rich\nfriends.\nBy the way, why should you need an excuse for living within\nyour meansT\nThis is the day and age to cut out shams, and Aim flams, even\nwith yourself.\n"DE3 TAG" FOB AHE2I0A\n"Der Tag" or "the day," the coming of which was uproariously\ntoasted by German officers years before the war, is at last due to ar\nrive. But, far from being an event for German celebration, it will\nprove one of mourning for the kaiser\'s cohorts, for "der Tag" in\nthis case- is Jane 28th, officially designated by President Wilson as\n"War Savings Stamp Day" throughout the United States.\nIt will mark the culmination of a two-weeks\' drive for the sale\nof these "baby bonds," and when the returns are in, it is the confi\ndent expectation of those behind the movement, that they will indi\ncate every citizen of age or condition, will have generously invested\nin thia patriotic enterprise.\n, aa f\nNow that a prominent Nevada stockman has come out second\nbest in an encounter with a wildcat it is in line to prepare a bill to\npresent to the next legislature asking an appropriation for the ex\ntermination of the cat species.\nWhat German submarines are doing to shipping in American\nwaters is nothing to what supermarines are doing to the Germans in\nFrance.\nGratitude is the memory of the heart.

Store up! for a rainy day."\nThe people heard, as the Scout flashed by,\nThey heard his fervent earnest cry.\nAnd out of the stockings laid "away\nThey gathered their savings of many years\nAnd poured them forth with hearty cheers.\n"Take these," they cried, in the cause of right,\n"Well do our bit and add our mite,\nWe\'ll help to fight and win this war,\nWe\'Jl save as ne\'er we saved before."\nAnd when the Scout on his valiant steed\nHad spread the call of his Country\'s need,\nHe drew the reins as he reached home\nAnd patted the neck all flecked with foam.\n"Our work is done," he said, "Old Man\nThe Nation\'s roused to a War Thrift plan."\nBennett Chappie.\nI A.

The\ngreat war we are waging for freedon necessitates the putting of\nhundreds of thousands of men in the fielc! and keeping them fed and\nclothed. It necessitates the production of ships and shells, guns and\nmotor trucks and airplanes and hospital supplies. To produce these\nthings will require the combined effort of most of the big industrial\nplants of the country, which are still making for you and your friends\nall the pleasant and comfortable luxuries you consumed before the\nwar.\nYou bought Liberty Bonds, of course, and you\'ll buy more next\nmonth. That is patriotic and highly commendable. But you are not\ndoing enough when you draw money out of the bank and invest it\nin Government securities. You must do more. You must buckle\ndown and make it your own personal daily business to help win the\nwar. You must give up the things you don\'t need.\nThe Government must have money a tremendous quantity of\nmoney and it must have the productive labor of millions of workers\nrho are now making unnecessary articles for yon and other Ameri\ncans who can afford to buy them.\nGet the Thrift Stamp Habit\nYou, Mr. Business Man : When you go home tonight, take your\nwife a Thrift Card, with a dozen stamps attached, instead of a box of\ncandy or a box of flowers. If she is the right sort, she will appre\nciate it far more than she would candy or flowers.\nAnd you, Society Women : Give War Savings Stamps for prizes\nat your card parties for favors at your luncheons for wedding\ngifts and anniversary remembrances, or buy stamps with the money\nthe parties cost.\nThrift Stamps and War Savings Stamps can be purchased at an\npostoffiee or bank.\nIIOTHEIIS OF FIGHTING AIXE2ICA\n"The stories of disease among the boys at the front, from my\nobservation, have been over-emphasized," says J. A. Whitmore, Sec\nretary of the Y. M. C. A., recently returned from France.\n"Let us "be careful that the same influences which worked to\nwreck Russia, that the same influences which played havoc in the\nsecond Italian army, and which are at work today in America in\nmany, many subtle ways, shall not disunite us. Let us, with a -loyalty\nand a devotion to our men, demand the winning of this war. This is\nnot a time to talk peace. We should talk about how we can pay the\nprice of winning winning the war for America, for our Allies, and\nfor God and humanity." Mother\'s Magazine.\nJAMES D.
