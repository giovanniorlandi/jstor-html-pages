That plan\nas incomplete in that it failed to\nasign to ench Stnto its definite\nshare of tho division or organization\nof tho district. Furthermore, no\nprovision was made for tho organ\nization of tho corresponding army\ntroops.\nTho plan just completed supplies\nthese deflciences. Under thi3 sys\ntem Ohio and Michigan compriso\nthe tenth division. Tho quota oftho\ntwo States, if 400,000 militiamen\nwere nvailablo in the entire coun\ntry, would be 32,950 men, Ohio fur\nnishiiig 20,730 and Michigan 2,220.\nTho mobilization point in Columbus\nis fixed at Columbus and in Michi\ngnn at Grayling.\nKentucky in Ninth Division.\nIndiana and Illinois, comprising\nthe eleventh division, would be call\ned upon for 11,745 nnd 24,520 men\nrespectively; Ft. Benjamin Harrison\nis the mobilization point for In-\ndinna. Kentucky is assigned to the\nninth division comprising Alabama,\nMississippi and Tennessee.\nKentucky\'s quota under tho ten\ntative plan is 9,900 men, and Ft.\nThomas is the mobilization point.\nWest Virginia would be called\nupon for 5,310 men. It is a part of\ntho seventh division, which also\ncomprises Delaware, New Jersey,\nMnryland, District of Columbia and\nWest Virginia.\nTo obtain such militia strength as\nthis plan contemplates tho actual\nenlistments as tho present time\nwould have to bo practically quad\nrupled. Tho paper strength of tho\nmilitia at present is 119,000 men.\nLess than 50 per cent of this num\nber aro classified as efficient.\nTho Ohio National Guard nomi\nnally includes 0,400 men and offic\ners at tho present time, Indiana,\n2,500, Kentucky, 2,200 and West\nVirginia 1,500. Ohio would be call\ned upon for a smaller portionate in\ncrease in militia strength than any\nof the other three States, although in\nactual number the State of Ohio\nwould have a quota nearly as large\nas tho other three States combined.\nFavored by War Department.\nWar Department officials are\n.anxious that provision shall be\nmade for un increase in the militia.\nIt is not intended that 400,000 men\nshall be kept constantly on duty any\nnore than it is the practice nt the\nresent timo to keep the militia on\nity. But if it were possible to\nhave 400,000 men well trained for\nmilitary service, army officers point\nfco the fact that the United States\nwould have a reserve force in the\nState troops four times as largo as\nthe present nominal strength of\nStato troops and more than eight\ntimes as largo as tho present aetunl\nand efficient strength.\nTho tentative plan outlined by the\nmilitia division would provide\nenough troops for four field armies,\nof three divisions each. There\nvould be quick mobilization of tho\nStato forces at central,, points in\neach State, and from thero divisions\nfor brigades would bo entrained\nfor larger points at each of which\ni complete army of 100,000 could\ni,o mobilized.\nLot ovcry wheel turn every plow\nmove every man work.

Sena\ntor James sees in Mr. Camden a\nmost formidable contestant, three\nyears hence, for the Jnmes scat in\nthe Senate. If it is possible for\nhim now to destroy tho Camden in\nlluencc and \'prestige, then tho seat\ncan be retained. If he can not de\nstroy his colleague\'s influenco now,\nthen there will bo a poor chance\nlot n..\nThe mental process is extremely\nsimple, and if a man\'s actions can\ndenote the prompting thought in tho\nbrain, then Senator James\' motive\nfor his attacks on Senator Camden\nis crystal clear.\nEvery earmark of tho attack\nshows our conclusion to bo correct.\nWas the James speech a dignified\nargument delivered for tho purpose\nof converting Senator Camden to\nhis ,way of thinking? No part of\nthe speech was an argument as has\nbeen pointed out by Mr. Breckin\nridge, and the speech contained no\nsiugle statement of either fact or\nargument that would chango the\nopinion, already formed, of any in\ntelligent man.\nOn the other hand, Senator\nJames\' speech was nothing mort\nor less than a bitter personal at\ntack. Not in tho least an argu\nuerit, if was an occasion to vent\npersonal spleen, fathered and urg\ned on by a selfish desire to "get"\nSenator Camden.\nSenator Camden needs no one\nto defend him. He is a straight\nthinking man who has very probab\nly reached the right conclusion.\nOn the other hand, Senator\nJames, too eager of opportunity,\nhas bitten himself. The venom did\nnot find resting place in tho object\nbf his attack, thanks to the public\nity given the matter by a few peoplo\nwho see clearly. Paris Democrat,\nAdmiral Bcncke of the German\nnavy offers to be a sane and sensi\nble solution of the perplexing prob\nlem which is threatening to disrupt\ntho friendship which exists betwecu\nthe United States and Germany.\nThe admiral suggests that several\nAmerican warships proceed to the\nsouthwest coast of Ireland, and,\nwhen communicated with by an\nAmerican merchant ship, that ono\nof our war vessels convoy tho mer\nchantman through tho "war zone"\nwaters and into safety. Wouldn\'t\nthis bo preferable to a possiblo war\nwith Germany?\nAny person mny keep himself\nwell posted on current local events,\nbo regarded as a well read man,\nknow what\'s what and who\'s who\nin the community, nnd havo num\nerous attractivo proposition placed\nbeforo him for tho trifling invest\nment of about two cents a week.\nFor proof of this statement invest\na dollar a year in this paper.\n"Let us live tho new love," says\nMrs. Ilavelock Ellis.

Reviewing her many\nrind deeds and charitable acts, in\ntho years gone by, it causes those\nwho knew her to little wonder why\nGod permitted almost four score\nyears and ten to pass before Ho\nicckoned her home. But somehow,\nsomo time one\'s earthly duties must\ncease, and it was with a heart full\nof 6adness to those who knew and\nloved her, to learn that she fell\nasleep on Wednesday morning, Feb\nruary 10, 1915, at the homo of her\ndaughter, Mrs. Robert L. Stone,\nnear Owingsville. Her frail consti\ntution could not withstand the rav\nages of pneumonia. In the early\ndays of her girlhood, Mrs. Hamilton\nbecame a member of tho Christian\nchurch,"and every act thereafter\nwas that of a truo follower of the\nCross. It must indeed pleaso Him,\nas Ho looks down from on High, to\nseo His humblo followers getting tho\nbest there is out of life, and ever\nstriving to plant a rose wherever a\nrose will grow. Mrs. Hamilton\'s\nnaiden namo was Kendall,\' and "was\nborn in Bath county, Ky., July 12,\n1828. On October 23rd, 1850, she\nwas married to Judge Thomas Boyd\nHamilton. Judge Hamilton died in\n1888.
