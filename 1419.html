Depres of In-\'\ndian Springs, DL Lwant to tell what\nthe stockyards gang did to me. When\nMr. Armour donated the money to\nthe Republican state committee he\ndonated $800 of my hard-earned\ncash.\n" \'I shipped everything I had on\nhoofs into the Chicago market when\nthe quarantine was on last summer.\nThe -market could not help but be\ngood because there hadn\'t been\n. much cattle sent\' in for three weeks.\nV " \'When I did get in my cattle were\nfirst in the pens. Do you think I got\n\' a high, price? Why the stockyards\ngang knew that I couldn\'t ship out\nagain hecause of the quarantine, so\nthey cut prices until I lost $800. 1 had\nto sell my steers for $800 less than\nit costvme to raise them.\'\n"This farmer was dumfounded. He\nknew that something was wrong\nwith the way things were run in the\nstockyards, but he didn\'t know what.\n"The big raisers of cattle are wise.\nThey don\'t sell a single steer to the\nyards gang, but they do sell to small\ner growers, who take the animals\nand fatten them. When the little fel\nlow gets run out of business by the\nmethods of Mr. Armour or other\nStockyards packers it hurts the\ntrade of the big fellows. So they\n\' organized, formed plans for the Bor\nTaad resolution calling for, su federal\ninvestigation of the packers, started\nam independent plant in Kansas City\nand called the convention in Chica\ngo. They are roused.\n"Every year hundreds of raisers\nhave been run out of business be\ncause when they took their cattle to\nmarket they could not get a price\nthat would pay for the raising.\n"The cattle raisers are against the\npackers owning stockyards. That\ngives them complete control of the\nsituation. Imagine yourself selling..\nYou have to trust your cattle with\nthe stockyards bunch while await\ning a chance to sell. You have to\njump in at the best moment. Mean\nwhile you pay fancy rent for the use\nof the pens. The longer you leavs\nyour cattle waiting for good prices\nthe more you have to pay out in rent\nand this comes out of your profits.\n"If your cattle are held -over night\nthe packers call them stale cattle\nand take off 25 cents a head. .When\nyou have a drive of 10,000 this\namounts to $2,500.\n"Then you have to pay for feed\nand care. When you finally step up\nand sell you may npt even get back\nwhat it cost you to raise the cattle.\n"The grading of the cattle is all\ndone by the packing men. - Stock\ngrowers say they don\'t get a square\ndeal on this. The weighing of the\nanimals is also up to the packing\nhouse buyers. You have to take their\nword for it\n"Meat prices are kept down in the\nstockyards in this manner. The\nmarket opens steady., That means\nthe price -for steers Is the same asy\'it\nwas when the market closed the\nnight before.\n"Then perhaps Armour & Co. -will\noffer 2-5 of a cent off the steady\nprice. Buyers hold off, but a few sell\nat this figure. Along comes Swift &\nCo. offering to buy at 3-5ths off; then\nCudahy may offer to buy at a cent\noff,. \'jao the tjattlemen. are forceJL io\n!&\' f', 'sell to Mr. Armour at a price lowerJT ALLIES\nthan the day before.\n"When Armour has enough he "will\nstep out of the market and some one\nelse will advance their offer to the\n2-th off price. Growers -will sell here,\ntoo, until this packer is filledi then\nhe moves off the market. In this way\nthey all get what they -want, hut\nthere is no real competition. That is\nwhat hurts the raisers.\n"It makes me, laugh to read some\nof the claims of Armour about the\nlow price of meat 2nd the small mar\ngin he claims exists between the\ncost of the -animal and the selling\nprice.\n"Armoiir makes his entire profit,\nand a big one, too, from the sale of\nskins, tallowr fat, entrails, fertilier\nand bone. Since the -war in Europe\neyery one of these products has\nsoared in value and the packers are\nfeaping the benefit \'The price of\nmeat has not gone up much, but it\njshould go down, since Armour is\n\'clearing more on the by-products.\n"Outside the market the packers\'\nmethods of controlling the business\nare interesting. Here they have the\nindustry tied up just as tight"\no o\nBLOODY WAR TO A FINISH IS\nWAY BERLIN SEES IT\nBerlin, Jan. 2. Berlin\'s peace\nhopes are dispersed.

G. Chapman.)\nA baby between lines of trenches!\nThe troops had advanced by night\nunder the searchlight; they had tak\nen up a new position within a hun\ndred yards of the enemy, on what\nhad been a farm. And at dawn they\ncould all distinctly see the child sit\nting up in the hole made by a 10\ninch shell, one hand extended toward\nthe rumed buildings.\nIt was a raw and foggy morning\nand presently, while the men still\ngaped, the mist came down and hid\nthe child from sight To show a head\nabove the sandbags ordinarily meant\ninstant death. But now a dozen men\nleaped from the trenches and ran\n\' forward.\nThere came a fusillade from the\nenemy and half of them fell dead in\ntheir tracks. The rest staggered on\nward, wounded, to collapse, one by\none. Only one man reached the edge\nof the crater before he collapsed,\nshot through the heart.\nThe fog lifted. By a miracle the\nchild had escaped injury. She was\nstill seated there in the shell-hole.\nProm the opposing trenches a dozen\nmen came crawling forward through\nthe wires. Those of their opponents\nopposite them forbore to fire. But to\nthe1 right and left were soldiers who\nwere ignorant of the situation. A\nfusillade rang out and of the dozen\nmen only three were left to work\ntheir way forward.\n"Cease firing!" came the order.\n\'But it is hard to control a body of\ntroops that stretches away for .un\nknown miles on either side. A sep\nond volley, and not a man remained\nto rescue or fly.\nThe child was still uninjured. The\nbullets passed over her head and\nnone had struck her. Both sides,\neach distrusting the other, waited\nuntil nightfall. All through the after\nsoon, at intervals, the baby could be\nseen, when the fog lifted. Each slcft\nformed a volunteer party of half a\ndozen to make the rescue after night\nhad fallen.\nThe two parties started simulta\nneously, crawling through their wire\nentanglements and working their\nway across No Man\'s Land. They\nmet in the middle. There was no\nchance for explanations. The rifles\nCarrying in His Arms an Enormous\nRag Doll.\nspoke, the bayonets did their quick\nwork. Star shells shot up, revealed\nthe twelve in deadly grapple.\nBuoyed up by the sense of their\nmission, neither side would yield.\nThey fought each other to death in\nthat desolate waste of water-filled\ncraters. Not one man returned.\nOn either side the soldiers waited\nin increasing apprehension until\nmorning showed the heap of bodies\nii r i rrtf i if inri i', 'lymmmmmimmmm\nn\nround the crater. Within. It the\ncould still be seen. She had\nfallen forward on her fce. She\nmight be dead, but there was still the\nhope that she was living. Perhaps\nshe slept And the soldiers, many of\nwhom were married men, were filled\nwith anguish and the -resolution to\nsave her or to bring back the little\nbody for burial.\nIt was evident that another day\ncould not be allowed to pass without\nthe rescue. Projects were mooted.\nIt was suggested that the artillery\nshould be brought to bear upon the\nenemy trenches, with a view to a\ngeneral advance into them. But this\nwas deemed to dangerous an under\ntaking. It was not humanly possible\nthat a general advance could be\nmade without a stray bullet striking\nthe little form" within the crater. It\nwas an Irishman who solved the\nproblem. ,\n"Sure, who wants to hurt a baby?"\nhe asked. "Let\'s ask them to send\nout six men to meet ours and well\nsave her."\nThe idea found general acceptance.\nNotice boards were quickly written\nin three languages.\n"Don\'t fire. We are going to pick\nup the kid," ran the English one. And\nthe French ran similarly it was at\nthe junction of the two armies. On\nthe opposite side of No Man\'s Land\nthe Germans had put up a notice to\nthe same effect in: their own lan\nguage. They quickly exchanged it fpr an-,\nother. "When?" they asked.\n"At twelve o\'clock," answered the\nEnglish.\nIt meant an hour to wait All the\neyes were strained upon the baby.\nShe had not moved since the morn\ning. There was every fear that she\nwas dead. And half an hour before\nthe time set the artillery behind the\nBritish lines began to rumble. Show\ners of shells broke upon the opposite\ntrenches. The artillery of the Ger\nmans answered. -And since nothing\nwas known at the rear about the\nchild, and because Its life or death\nwas a small matter in the general\nrun, the attempt was abandoned.\nAll that day the soldiers on either\nside\' crouched in their trenches and\nwaited for the artillery to cease. A\ngeneral attack had been ordered for\nsix o\'clock on the Franco-British\nfront There were few now who\ncherished any hope of saving the\nbaby\'s life. Yet none of the shells\nhad fallen near the crater, and the\nlittle body was still visible there.\nAt six o\'clock the British artillery\nsuddenly ceased. The men leaped\nfrom their trenches and ran forward,\ncheering.\nBut to their surprise their oppon\nents did not wait for them but ran\nforward also, perhaps inspired by the\nsame motives. The two parties met\non a half-mile front Bayonet clash\ned with bayonet, there was fierce\nthrust and parry, men fell dying, the\ncries of the wounded rent -the air,\nand neither side would give way.\nIt was not until the combat had\nbeen thinned out by the loss of thou\nsands lhat the two lines of enemies\nsullenly withdrew and made for thejr\nrespective trenches. But there were\nthose -on either side who remem\nbered. And, moved by a simultaneous im\npulse, six men from either of the con\nflicting armies rushed toward the\nshell crater. Tacitly they ignored\neach other. A big Scotchman leaped\nInto the hole and emerged, carrying\nin his arms an enormous rag doll,\nwith a painted face of bisque.\nIt was ruddled with bullet holes\nand had evidently been abandoned\nby the former owners. Perhaps the\nvery child whose plaything it had\nbeen had long ago grown tired of it\nYet it was strangelyhuman in ap\npearance, and the head, with the\ngolden curls, dropped forward like\nthat of a tired child sleeping.\nThere was a stunned silence on\neither side. With no thought of\nfighting, the men intermingled and\nclustered about the figure. How\nm&mXM ..AWaMAuit.a', 'msmmrnmmgmmimmmmmmm\niny thousands had died for this rag\ndoll! It was grotesque and pitifuL\nThe Scotchman laid the doll down\nin the crater and flung a little earth\nover it with his foot He looked up\nat the faces of the enemy.\n"It\'s for a trifle like this that good\nmen\'s lives have been flung away!"\nhe said bitterly.\nThere was silence, till a young stu\ndent answered him:\n"Are we any wiser?" he asked\nquietly.\nThe other appeared as if about to\nanswer him; but instead he turned\nhis back, and, calling his men,\nmarched them back toward the\ntrenches, under the muttering of the\nguns.\nECONOMY IN COOKING!

S.\nsenate, although it was not the big\nfactor. If Brandeis had been a\nmoney-mad, reactionary, commer\ncialized Jew, Big Business would\nnot have opposed his confirmation.\nAs he happened to be a progressive,\nliberal and humane Jew, however,\nSpecial Privilege feared his mental\nbias in favor of justice rather than\nhis ancestry and used the fact that\nhe was a Jew only where they\nthought that argument would make\nvotes against him. Race prejudice\noperates against the Jew more so\ncially than commercially. He is\nbarred from membership in most\nclubs, but he is not barred from'\nbanks, markets and business. He is\nnot barred from the advertising col\numns of newspapers, though he\ncan't break into the inner circle of\nhigh sassiety. He isn't barred from\npolitics in cities where there is a big\nJewish vote. And the Jewish vote in\nthis country is so big now that poli\nticians in the United States senate\ndon't dare oppose the confirmation\nof a Jew like Brandeis on the sole\nground that he is a Jew. N. D.\nCochran.\nTHE LOOP CONGESTION. Mr.\nMiller's suggestion as to enlarging\nthe loop is a good one. It will tend\nto widen the business district, so\nthat fewer people will be obliged to\ngo to the congested center.\nBut, in the meantime, the popula\ntion of the city will be increasing,\nand, present conditions continuing,\nthe spacial limit of the loop district\nnear the river will continue over\ncrowded. Present facilities carry\nmore people there than earth space\ncan accommodate. Skyscrapers add\nto the accommodations overhead.\nAdding facilities subterranean or ce\nlestial still leaves congestion on the\nsurface.\nInstead of building more skyscrap\ners and more facilities to get to the\ncenter, we should limit the height of\nbuildings and guide the transporta\ntion facilities so that business will be\nforced to spread over the territory\noutside the loop.\nLandowners in the loop will object,\nof course, but land owners in other\nplaces will welcome the change. We\nwould take rent from the loop own\ners and put it in the pockets of land\nowners in other locations. One set\nwould swear at us and the other\npraise. But how about the great\nmass of the wage earners? They\nwould not be any better off. Popu\nlation constantly increasing in the\ncity would increase rent (the price of\nusing the land) and decrease wages\n(the price paid to labor that uses\nland).\n11\n0", 'sthlng can stop this but the tak-\nig of rent (the price paid I)y labor\nthe privilege of using the bars\nland) for public revenue and the abo\nlition of all other taxes.\nPeople should think more about\nthis fundamental principle more\nthan they do.

That scriptural\nquotation is most appropriate to the\nchanges now taking place. The\ndeath and annihilation now so evi\ndent throughout much of the so\ncalled Christian world is precursory\nof the establishment of something\n. far better. It means a step in evolu\ntion. The Lord is liberating us from\nour old-time follies.\nOur superstitions induce us to\ncling to the evils that we have,\nrather than to run to something\nwhich we know not of. Those fears,\nhowever, are superstitions pure and\nsimple. No matter if they refer to\nwhat is called death, it will be a\nblessing for every one. No matter\nwhat your life has been, the ultimate\nresult will be an advantage. There\nis no death. Such change is but a\nstep forward and upward. Life is of\nnature and does not cease. The\nthings that now are dying are im\npostures, the man-made stuffs called\nlegal governments, monarchies,\nheaded by wretches who call them\nselves God-men, konig-men, king\ncraft, priestcraft, etc. In democra\ncies legal craft is the equivalent of\nthe above profanations. No. matter\nwho you are you should thank God\nfor the destruction now taking place.\nThe beneficiaries of graft never relax\ntheir grip until force is applied to\nthem.i The suffering of the people\nis awful during the straggle, but the\njoys that shall follow to those who\nremain in the human will repay for\nthe suffering a hundredfold.

I want to test the sincerity\nof our modern Ijharisees.\nIf state prohibition is ineffective\nbecause of non-inforcement, the lo\ngical reason must be that he people\ndo not want prohibition for them\nselves. They vote dry for other rea\nsons; perhaps because their -forefathers\ndid, that being most logical\nwith that class.

And the queer part of it all,\nMargie, was that my other care-free\nexistence seemed but a dream.\n"No one could have loved her par\nents more than I did, and yet I could\nhardly realize that I had ever had\nparents. There is something about\nthe absolute finality of death which\nmakes itself felt in the consciousness\nof even the tenderest and most sym\npathetic mind.\n"I believe, Margie, only those who\nhave lost by death some one who is\nvery dear to them can understand\nwhat I mean. The old saying, \'While\nthere is life there is hope,\' is very\ntrue; and its anthithesis, when there\nis no life there is no hope, is quite as\ntrue.\n"Your mind refuses to think about\nit any more.

They allow the great\nest; tyranny because It appears to\nsafeguard law and order.\nFEAR is the Great Enemy. We\nconsole ourselves for all our blunders\nand disgraces by "the bravery of our\nsoldiers" as set forth in war cor\nrespondence carefully edited by\nthemselves.\nNo doubt our soldiers fieht fiercely\nenough; there is nothing new in the\nfact that man is the most dangerous\nof the animals. War is\' an orgy of\ncrime based on the determination of\nthe soldier to stick at nothing to\nbring it to an end and get out of\ndaily danger .of being shot Every\nsoldier confesses this; his pet para\ndox Is that clemency is mistaken\nkindness.\nBut the great evil to fight is pov\nerty. By our failure to relieve poverty\nwe are brigands. Money Js the" most\nimportant thing in the world, and all\nthe evils we have to struggle against\nare due to the fact that children are\nnot taught that from their earliest\nyears.\nI hear bishops recommending the\npeople of East London to be thrifty.\nThe bishops who do that commit a\ncrime, if a poor man saves a single\nfarthings he is behaving selfishly bei\ncause he is saving it off clothing or\nlodging of his children, and under\n.such circumstances he is a- scoun\ndrel. The poorer the people the more\nimportant it is to spend ALL they\nhave.\nOur present system would work if\nonly people died. If an unemployed\nman could be thrown into the street\nwith the surety that he would die\nshortly, it would be all right But he\ndbes not die. He becomes a factor\nfor drink or other infectious disease\nwhich most of us catch.\nIf I were prime minister I should\nstart with very simple beginnings\nand bring in a bill for the communi\nzation of bread. This old idea was\nset up -under Elizabethan poor laws,\nbut people nowadays, are too proud\nto take advantage of it Friends of\nmine who have been in prison assure\nme that the best \'bread is baked by\nthe state, and the next best is poor\nhouse bread. There would be a big\nrush for it at first, and much waste,\nbut after a little there would be no\nwaste, nether would any one go hun\ngryas under the present social sys\ntem. The next item of my ministerial\nprogram would be that a town\nshould belong to the people who\nlive in it. The citizens would then\nbuild their town for themselves,\nWITHOUT SLUMS. The landlords\nwould be paid for their land and the\nJ cost of ground rents removed from\nthe overburdened taxpayers. THEN\nI would put a tax of 62 cents in $5\nqn the $3,13S,0QQ,0Q0 unearned in\ncrement, and I would reduce the tax\non earned incomes to 6 cents in $5.\nBut to return: What .makes the\nnew year a hopeful" one for Ameri\ncans? The immigration that is\' being\nkilled off; and the education they\nmay build up.\nThe modern system of education\nis a tremendous hypocrisy.

Persons\nwho live with their children do so\nbecause they cannot afford to send\nthem to boarding school. The good\npoint about boarding schools is that\nthey save children from the. demor\nalizing influences of the home. Still,\ndo not know a more ghastly spec\ntacle than a number of children hav\ning a lesson and forced to sit it out.\nAH this must be altered. England\nhas no money to change the anom\nolies\'of the present educational sys\ntem, but America cannot afford to\ndo otherwise.\nThe teacher must be taught to say\nto the child, "While you are inter\nested, stay; when you are bored, go\nout and play"\nTeach the children to read and\nwrite and then their education so\nfar as the school is concerned is\ncomplete. I learned practically noth\ning at school, but look at me! The\nresult is eminently satisfactory. My\nwife, who had an expensive educa\ntion, comes to me when she wants\nthe-housekeeping books added up.\nThe war goes on. I am no more a\nChristian than are you, gentle read\ner, yet after contemplating the\nworld and human nature for almost\nBO years I see no way out of the\nworld\'s misery but the way which\nwould have been found by Christ\'s\nwill if he had undertaken the work\nof a modern practical statesman.\nThe moneyed, respectable, \'capable\nworld has been steadily anti-Christian\nsince the Christian era began,\nrhe mention of God has gone out of\nfashion. You never hear about God\nin parliament and only occasionally\nm the law courts.\nWe are neither bigoted enough- to\neut each other\'s throats, nor reli\ngious enough to respect and under\nstand one another\'s beliefs\nThe religious man is not a person\nwho does or does not belong to any\ncreed, but a man who has a constant\nknowledge that he is here as the in\nstrument of the universal force.\nThe main truth is that God has no\nhands but your hands, no brakis b\nyour brains; for God is nothing but\nWill. I believe that the Higher Pow\ner, the Almighty Force we call God,\ncannot do the work of the world\nwithout our help.
