        <pre>['The Doctrine of Christian Science Ably Ex\npounded at the Opera House by Judge\nClifford P. Smith? An Intelligent Audi\nence Listens with Rapt Attention\nThe lecture at the opera house last\novcnlnK under the auspices of the\nChriHtlan Science Society of ICIko, was\nwell attended and thu speaker held\nthe undivided attention of the audi\nence from the beginning till the end.\nThe speaker, Judge Clifford I*.\nSmith, was introduced by Judge\nCurler in well chosen remarks on\nChristian Science. We publish here\nwith a few excerpts from the lecture:\nDominion U\\er Kill\nThere Is another subject, closely\nconnected with life and health, in\nwhich all people" are presently inter\nested; that is dominion ? dominion\nover evil. Involved therein Is the\ndifference between misery and hap\npiness throughout human affairs. Ac\ncording to the Itible the law of our\ncreation and being includes the de\ncree. "I?ct them have dominion" ? do\nminion "over all the earth." This is\none of the natural rights of man, and\nit is one that exists in all its fulness\nas an idea to be apprehended and\nrealized, even though the average\nman manifests more subjection than\ndominion.\nTlii* ideal was instanced by liiin\nto whom St. Paul referred a* "the\nman Christ Jesus"; and it was he who\nsaid. "My peace I give unto you." Ills\npence was the result of dominion; it\nuas the result of power over what\never would disturb the harmony of\nman. An observation on this point by\nMrs. Kddy was illuminating to me,\nand it may be to you. Said she "With\nour Master, life wan not merely a\nsense of existence, but an accom\npanying sense of power that subdued\nmatter and brought to light immort\nality." t Retrospect Ion and Intro\nspection. page 58). For us to have\nhis peace we must gain that true\nsense of power which he possessed\nand exericlsed.\nNow, what was the secret of Ills do\nminion? By virtue of what did he\npossess such utillmlatcd power? Iledls\nclosed the basis of it by saying, "I\ncan of mine own self do nothing."\nThat is to s.ty, ho possessed power or\ndominion only by virtue of man\'s re\nlation ao (Sod ? only by rea\nson of man\'s unity with the infinite\nntid omnipotent Mind. It was this\nunity, this at-oncmcnt. which he ex\nompllfled throughout his earthly car\neer; ami the main reason for the com\nmon error that man is a material self\nhood separated from CJod.\nThere Is another aspect of domin\nion that Is equally important. That\nis, dominion is not tl.e power to in\nterfere with the rightful and lawful\norder of tho universe, nor is it the\npower of one present to impose bis\nhuman will on another. It is the\npower to overcome disorder, the sub\ndue discord and to maintain the law\nof (Sod. It is the power to demon\nstrate the truth of being. It is tho <\npower to overcome evil with good, i\nwhereby (Sod\'s will Is done on earth\nas It is in heaven.\nMlnlsfrj of .Ichiim\nPeter described tho ministry of\nJesus by saying Unit ho "wont about\ndoing good and healing all that wore\noppressed of t lie (lovll; Tor Coil wan\nwith him." Ills ministry ? consisted\nless of verbal Instruction Hum It did 1\n?>f ohjcct lessons whoroby ho lllust\nratcd man\'H rlKlit Tit I and nntural do\nminion over evil. Indeed Ills entire\nearthly nnreor, In which ho ovoreamo,\none after another, tho errors Incident\nto tho human or mortal sense of life, 1\nuntil ho rose completely above It\nthis was tho supreme instance and\nexample of man\'s Ood-glvonn domin\nion and being. That ho acted law\nfully and In accordance with the will\nof (Sod lie himself declared, and the\nclaim that the power to do as he did\nwas supernatural, abnormal or pe\nculiar to himself ho anticipated and\nrefuted when he snld: "lie that be\nlle voth on me, the works that I do\nshall he do also"; "These signs will\nfollow them that bellovo."\nImrliiK the drat three aenturlon of\ntho Christian era tho disciples of\nChrist exorcised In varying decrees\ntho dominion which tho Master exem\nplified. Then a personal and super\nnatural sense of tho Saviour removed\ntheir concept of .lesus\' llfework from\ntho realm of naturalness and law to\nthat of mystery and miracle. It\nshould be remembered, however, thai\ntho Oreok words which are usually\nbut not always translated "miracle"\nIn the King James version of the\nlllble, have no supornnt urn I mean\nIn^. Their moaning varies from an\nact of power, a mighty work, to a\nsign or proof, and they do not denote\nthat which Is supernatural. Jesus\nhimself dellnod by usage tho meaning\nof the Oreok word most frequently\nused In referring to his healing works\nwhen he snld: "These signs shall\nfollow them that believe." The Oreok\nword hero rendered "slgna" is tho\nsame word elsewhere translated\n"miracle."\nJe?tis SIiom* May\nNear tlio close of Ills earthly career\nJesus said to Ills disciples, "Be of\ngood cheer; 1 have overcome the\nworld." If what he accomplished was\nInexplicable or supernatural, what\nreason had they to "be of good cheer"\nbecause of his overcoming? It is not\nfairly evident that he thus spoke be- i\ncause he had shown the way for them\nand for us? Did not Ills overcoming\nof evil "bear witness unto the truth?"\nMis acts of power were done In ac\ncordance with law ? In accordance\nwith the immutable law of good. Ills\naction and power of divine Principle,\n?nighty works attested the presence,\nThe signs which he furnished proved\nthe true qualities of real being ? of\nyour being and mine? and proved it\nlo be free from evil. So far from be\ning supernatural his healing works\nwere supremely natural, for they\nevinced the true nature of God and\nman. They separated what is real\nand enduring from what Is destruct\nible and unreal. By words and deed*\nhe taught and proved the true idea of\n<lod and man, thus declaring their\ncntirc separation from evil. This was\nhis mission; this was the method bv\nwhich he was and is "the light of the\nworld."\nSuch being the case, It was inevit\nable that the science of these works\nshould be sooner or later discovered\nand that they should be resumed on a\nscientific and permanent basis. This\nhas now come to pass, in accordance\nwith the Master\'s prophecy and prom\nise of that which he said "will guide\nyou into all truth."\nChristian Science has come to dis\ncover and repeat what he know and\ntaught; to revive his original teach\ning; to restore the scope and com\nplete the mission of primitive Chris\ntianity; to be that \'Spirit of truth"\nwhich he foretold ami promised.\nMar) Kilil) linker\nSome persons are not disposed to\nconsider Christian Science seriously\nbecause it was discovered by a woman\nand by a person who was not pre\nviously as a theologian. It must tie\nadmitted, however, that spiritual dis\ncernment is not determined by sex;\nand he is a poor student of histor)\nwho expects this faculty to be deve\nloped only by human Institutions. So\nfar as favorable environment is con\ncerned. Mrs. Kddy was well supplied\nby the teaching and Influence of a\nmother whoso faith in Cod was of the\npurest and most practical character.\nFrom childhood Mrs. Kddy was a\nprofound student of the Scriptures,\nand her unusual grasp of spiritual\nideas was often observed by those\nwho knew her best. For Instance,\nfier tutor and pastor, the Kev. Knoch\nt\'orsor of Tilton, N. 1 1., once said this\nof her to his sou: "llright, good,\npure, aye, brilliant! I never before\nhad a pupil with such depth and in\ndependence of thought. She has\ntome great future, mark that. She\nis nn Intelluctuul and spiritual gen\nius." These words were spoken of\nMrs. Kddy nn she was between the\nages of 15 anil 22. Her discovery of\nChristian Science came to pass at the\nage of 4fi, when she entered upon her\nlarger career of service to humanity.\nThe attitude of existing churches\ntoward her message made it necess\nary for Mrs. Kddy to found a new\ni-hurch; but the Church of Christ.\nScientist, bus gained members only\nas those who have come to Christian\nScience have gnlned a better life.\nSurely there Is no cause for offense\nin this. It Is the object of all\nchurches, and none of them need feel\na loss when n man finds In Christian\nScience what he could not, or even\ndid not. And elswhere.\nMrs. Kddy novor sought n personal\nfollowing. \'i\'li ion tr li< > i it her work sir\nthe loader of a groat religious movo\nment h!i?? consistently turned (he at\ntention of Christian Scientists away\nfrom herself to the montnxfl from (Sod\n(o turn which was spoken through\nln-r Iter aim and hope, an she often\n?ald, were lo "quicken nnd Increase\nt ho beneficial olTeots of Chrlstanlty"\n(Science and llenllh, page ; mih\nccllaneous Writings, |> ige 207 1. Thin\nHplrltual vitality of her message It*\nproved hy what It hat already accom\nplished; but thin In only a foret\'is(e\nof the benefits that will acmre hu\nmanity an t hla science is more widely\nunderstood and practised.\nThe Comforter\nChristian 8clenee Ih not something\nmanufactured by Mr*. Kddy; It was\nunfolded to Mrs. Kddy and expressed\nby her In the manner described hy\nthe Master In tils prophecy of f.ho\nComforter: "lie shall not speak of\nhimself; but whatsoever lie shall\nhear, that shall bo ppoak." In this\nway Mrs. Kddy has been the moans\n! of giving to the world the scienc? of\nGod of His universe, including man,\nand especially this science as applied\nto humanity. It declares the one di\nvine Principle of the universe, scp\narates the error from the truth lu\nhuman thought, furnishes th-3 acien\ntitle method by which divine law is\navailable in the case of every human\nneed, and shows how evil can be o\\cr\ncome and abolished.\nTo the wise of this time Chrisiiai:\nScience healing is the sign of man\'*\ncomplete dominion over evil. It alg\nnifles that no ill or evil ? no harmful\nevent or condition ? is either lawful\nor natural; none is Inevitable; none\nbut what can be overcome with the\nlaw and power of (5od Christian\nScience adopts the ideal of worship\nand service set forth by Isiah: "To\nloose the bands of wickedness, to un\ndo the heavy burdens, and to let tha\noppressed go free, and that ye break\nevery yoke.\nChrist Jesus once said: "Every\nplant, which my heavenly Father hath\nnot planted, shall be rooied up." In\nother words, that only Is real and >11\nduring of which God is the author.\nAll evil, whether called mental, phy\nsical or moral, is illusive and unreal\nbecause it is contrary to the naturi\nof the only cause and creator. Thifc\nis the ba^is on which true healing 1>.\naccomplished; and every case o\'\nChristian Science healing therefore\ntdvanccs the time when the last vcf\ntige of evil will be expelled from hu\nman experience and the Master\'s de\nclaration will be fulfilled\noo\nNEW SENSE OF POWER\nSORELY TEMPTS MOTORISTS\nRoy K. Britton. St. Louis\' auto*\nmobile authority, says the reason\nthe new motorist is a noise maker\nis because he is unacustomed to\nhaving speed and noise pow?r at\nhis finders\' ends.\nWhenever the question of un\nnecessary noise so far as automobile\nhorns and other types of warning\nsignals are concerned, comes up in\nsi community, about the first thing\nthe investigator discovers is, that\nthe person who has just become a\nmot>?rist is usually inclined to vio\nlate both the speed and noise ethics.\nMr. Hoy F. Britton of St. Lou\'s,\nin speaking of this very matter the\nother day, said: "The man we have\nmost trouble with is the one who\nhas just learned to drive a motor\ncar. He revels in two farts, sense\nof possession and sense of power.\nIt fairly \'brills him to feel that he\nhas at has fingers\' ends the abdity\nto drive bis machine at break-neck\nspeed, and to make people realize\nby the steady blowing of his elec\ntric horn that be is approaching.\n"I do not think that any one can\nrealize \'his, the extent of this\ntemptation, who has not driven a\nmotor car. Older motorists are\nnot altogether free from yielding\nto the temptation. The result is\nthat the right sort of legislation\nsuch as we have here, restricting\nthe use of the warning signal to an\nabrupt sound, sufficiently loud to\nbe heard above the noise of the\ntraflic is an absolute necessity. And\nthe furtner nrovision that a warn\ning signal be only used as a warn\ning of real danger existing, brings\nabout the most desirable results."\nDRAPER CULTURE MEETING\nThe Draper Self-Culture Club\nmet with Mrs. Margaret Green\nlast Saturday afternoon and a\nmost instruc ive and profitable\ntwo hours wns spent in dis\ncussing current events, Wagner\'s\ndrama, "Parsifal" and Tennyson\'s,\n"llolv Grail". Mrs Frank Wheel\ner\'s musical selections were greatly\nappreciated The papers on\n"Parsifal" prepared by Miss Kne\nmeyer was excellent and the club\nconsiders they are most fortunate\nin securing such an efficient per?\nson as Miss Knemoyer for this\npaper. Mrs. Ogilvie rendered the\ndifficult task of reading "The Holy\ntirail" in a most creditable and\ncharming manner. The guests\nwere Mrs. Curler, Mrs. Peace,\nMrs. I.ander Taher.

BOOHER TELLS US\nALL ABOUT HIS TRIP\nHe Gives a Pretty Pen Picture of\nHow Democratic Presidents\nAre Made ? He Says the\nCountry is Safe.\nWashington, D. C. March 5, 1913.\nEditor Independent:\nLong 1?- [lire this reaches you,\nyour reaa ro will have read all\nabout the inauguration of Presi\ndent Wilson and what 1 may say\nwill be an old story. Before writ\ning about that, perhaps something\nabout my trip will be of interest.\nOn February 23d, the Overland\nLimited, castbound, took on a lone\npasssnger at Elko, bound for the\nNation\'s capital. There were no\nvacant berths and be found rest in\none smoking room and then another\nuntil tbe observation car was open\ned. The trip to Og Jen was with\nout incident. Reaching Ogden we\nwere informed that individual {\ndrinking cups were used on all\ntrains, and that if we wanted to\ndrink water from there on, we\nshould purchase cne. This was\ndone.\njmmmrn\nThe train soon pulled out for\nthe east. The ride through Utah\nand Wyonrng on Sunday was with\nout special interest. Monday\nmorning found us at Cheyenne.\nFrom there to Denver there was\nnothing of interest. The weather\nwas cold and the ground was\nrovered with snow. From Denver\nto Kansas City, there was but little\nsnow, but it continued cold. At\nTopeka, Kansas, it was the coldest\nmorning of the winter and the\nsnow was the deepest we had seen\non the trip. Kansas City to St.\nLouis was davligh\' ride through\na rich and populous Aiming region.\nTuesday night at a few minutes\nafter 9 o\'clock, the train crossed\nthe Mississippi river and halted at\nCincinnati early Wednesday morn\ning. Leaving there after 9 o\'clock,\nthe route* lay through southern\nOhio, the objective point being\nParkersburg, West Virginia. Leav\ning Patki-rsburg at 1 o\'clock in the\nafternoon. Washington was reach\ned at 2:36 Monday morning.\nAfter a night\'s rest we began to\n"see" Washington and have been\n"seeing" it ever since. Thecapitol,\nthe office buildings, the (louse and\nSenate were visited. Congressman\nBooher and Senators Newlands and\nPittman were very busy men, but\nall of them showed all tuc cour\ntesies their time would permit. We\nha e seen the House and Senate in\nsession and cannot say that we\nwere impressed with their methols\nof doing business. We heard the\npresiding officer declare bill after\nbill passed, taking money from the\npeople\'s treasury, on which no one\nvoted. The House seemed to us to\nbe about as disorderly a body of\nmen as we ever saw. Speaker\nClnrk nenrly wore out his gavel in\ntrying to maintain some semblance\nof order. Still, with all the seem\ning disorder, both bodies transact\na vast amount of business.\nsuffragette parade.\nOn Saturdny afternoon the "suff\nragette hikers" reached Washing\nton. tired and footsore. After rest\ning over Sunday, the suffragettes\nfrom all over the country paraded\nthrough the streets of the city.\nThey made a splendid showing,\nmarcuing like veterans. It is esti\nmated that 10,000 women, young,\nold, handsome and otherwise, were\nIn line. Your correspondent view\ned the procession from several points\nand saw nothing out of the way with\nthe conduct of the crowd along the\nstreets, hut the ladies have filed\nserious charges against the police\nfor their failure to protect the\nmarchers from insult and ahuse. If\nthe charges are true, the pjlice\ndepartment cf Washington City is\na disgrace to tno nation.\nINAUGURATION\nThe city began to fill up Sunday\nwith people from every section of\nthe union And hy Tuesday morning\nthere were 200,000 strangers in\nWashington, all bent on doing honor\nto President-elect Wilson. Pennsyl\nvania Avenue was filled with Kood\nnatured crowds. Gay decorations\nand millions of electric lights made\nI the avenue a scene of beauty, long\nto be remembered. Crowds swarm\ned through the Capitol, visited the\nHouse and Senate and viewed the\n| many objects of interest.\nWell. Tuesday morning finally\ncame, and the City was early astir,\nfor a new president was to take\nthe helm of government before the\nclose of the dav. Thousands of\npeople gathered around the east\nportico of the Capitol early in the\nmorning and he d their positions\nfor six or seven hours After what\nseemed to your correspondent an\nunnecessary delay, the procession\nof notables marched down the steps\nof the Capitol and took their allot\nted places, the President-elect, Vice\npresident Marshall, President Taft,\nChief Justice White and others, took\ntheir places on the platform. From\nwhere your corresponent sat, the\ndistinguished party was in full\nview. At the proper time Chief\nJustice White, in his official robe\ni administered the oath and Presi\ndent Wilson faced thousands upun\nI thousands and delivered an in\n1 ai .gural address that we believe will\nib> come classic in American liter\nature. While we could not hear a\nword we could hear the applause.\nAfter the address came a parade\n! that lHsted for several hour;.\nThirty thousand men in uniform\npassed the Capitol and thousands\nof demo rats formed along Penn\nsylvania avenue and joined the\nprocession that was reviewed by\nPresident Wilson. It was the\ngreatest procession Washington\n; ever saw. At least, that is ihe only\nopinion we have heard. It is\nneedless to say that we went to bed\nTuesday night believing the country\nwas safe.\nYours, etc,.\nW. W. Booher.\nFILLS A LONG-FELT WANT\nThe Intcrmountain Club held its\nopening last evening. The club\nhas a spacious suite of rooms on\nthe third floor of the Robinson and\nOuderkirk Building which is far\nand away the best and most impos\ning building in town. The club\nstarts out with one hundred mem\nbers and its success as a gentlmen\'s\nI social club is a foregone con\nclusion. Practically all the bus\nness men in town have either\njoined or signified their intention\nof doing so.\nZ. F. Wheeler is the manager\nand be deserves the credit for the\norganization of the club as he has\nbeen the leading spirit from otart\nro finish. There is a pool room,\ncard room, piano room and reading\nwhere all the latest books maga\nzines and papers are available.\nThe Independent joins the buis\nnes? men of Elko in extending a\nhand of wplcome to the new club\nand b( speaks for it a generous\nand continued support. It is a\nworthy cause and must advance the\nI social status of our "Men arojnd\nI town."\nWILL BUILD ADDITION\nTO LAMOILLE HOTEL\n"In the Rood old summer time,"\nwhen pleasure seekers turn to out\ndoor sports, fishing, hunting,\nenmping, etc., the attractions of\nLamoille, the summer resort of\nElko, county, will be greater than\never.\nGuy Chaplin, of this city, has\nleaned the Lamoille Hotel from\nthe l.nmoilb Mercantile company,\nand will build an addition so as\nto better accomodate the numerous\nvisitors during the summer months.\nA first class bar will be installed\nin connection with the hotel.\nWork on the new addition will\nbe started as soon as th? weather!\npermits, and will be completed by j\nJune 1.\nDEMOCRACY HOLDS\n(DLL SWAY AT THE\nNATIONAL CAPITAL\nNew Democratic Administration is\non Deck, as Large as Life\nand, as the Wag Says,\nTwice as Natural.\n(Special to Independent)\nWashington. D. C., Feb. 5, 1913.\n? Woodrow Wilson is a man who is\nconsidered to be one of the htrong\nest men in the United S ates and\nhe will make one of the strongest\nPresidents we ever had. Hut that\nin your pipe and smoke it. If he\ndoes not make such a president\nthen consider that I am not any\nlonger a prophet in politics hecause\nI heve erred with the head man\nin the Democratic party.\nThere is a thing, however, in the\nDemocratic party that ought to be\ncorrected and will be if ever the\nchance is given the committee in\nagricultural affairs in the next\ncongress to vote on that proposition\nand that is the position assumed\nby the democratic party represent\ning the tax on oleomargarine,\nwhich, under the new bill, is taxed\nso much. It was introduced by a\ndemocrat, Congressman Lever of\nSouth Carolina, and he had pro\nduced reasons in that bill why it\nshould become a law at the hands\nof the next Congress.\nThere are many reasons why the\nnext prsident. Mr. Wilson, ought\nto appoint a Navy man as Com\nmissioner of Pensions instead of\nan army man, because a Navy man\nhas never yet been Commissioner\nof Pensions.\nThere will hardly be any denying,\nin view of the Navy\'s great service\nfur the country and its increased\nimportance of late years, that it\nhas been neglected in this par\ntieular respect. With this salient\nfact in mind a number of the fine\nold tars whose b?st younger days\nwere devoted to perilous service\nwith Farraeut and Foote, when\nDewey and Schley were shipmates\nwith them, just out of the academy\nat Annapolis, ir the battles and\nblockades along the coasts in the\nwar between the States, have start\ned a movement to win the coni\nmissionership for a Navy man or\nknow the reason why. Only one of\nthem has been suggested for the\nhonor and he happens to be a Pro\ngressive Democrat, of New York,\nwho was an active worker in the\ncampaign in behalf of Governor\nWilson, and for Wiiliman Sulzer\nfor Governor o\' the Empire State,\nColonel Edward Creecy. He did\ngallant work with the best and\nbravest sailors ashore and at sea.\nMidshipman Creecy served through\nout the war, was on the 104 days\nof the cruise of the U. S. S. Mace\ndonian under orders to drive from\nour eastern coasts the Confederate\ncruisers, Florida and Tallahassee,\nwhich for months had been making\nhavoc of Yankee shipping from\nCape Ilatteras, North Caiolina, to\nF\'astport, Maine.\nPersistently declining to take a\nstep for himself toward securing\nthe otfice, the movement in Colonel\nCreecy\'s behalf has become so dis\ntinct and popular among veternnd\nof the Navy, some of them highly\ndistinguished officers and now re\ntired rear admirals, not to gather\nforce and attract serious consider\nation.\nIf the ocople who read this letter\ncould see the City of Washington\nat the present time they would\nthink that everybody was a demo\ncrat. It ia seated and there are\nmore lights on the broad expansive\nPennsylvania Avenue than e>er be\nfore. There are more stands with\nout dollars and cents to be had for\nthe asking than any time before in\nthe history of the United States.\nThese stands will all be filled with\npoople no matter what kind of\nweather we have and the chances\nare that we will have before this\nAdministration closes, another date\nfor their inauguration late in the\nC. Thomas Linlay stopped off in\nElko for a few days on hia way\nback to Cortez, where he is super\nintendent of and general manager\nfor the Cortez Metals Recovery Co.\nThis company has a cyanide plant\nof 100 ton capacity and it is now\nready to resume operations. He\nreports that Thomas Parker is\noperating the Cortez mine and is\nmaking frequent shipments by\nmeans of an auto truck to the S.\nP. at Beowawe- It is reported that\nhe is shipping a fine quality of good\nore. Cortez is an old camp and it\nis said that it has produced ninteen\nmillion dollars in the past and good\nthings are expected in the future.\nAdjacent to Cortez is Mill Canyon\nwhich is the scene of much activity\njust at present. He says Capt. J.\nB. Menardi of Goldfield fame is\noperating there with splendid\nchances of making a big producer\nout of the Cortez Mining and Re\nduction company\'s property at Mill\nCanyon. Capt. Menardi is running\nan automobile truck to Beowawe\nand has purchased material for a\nnew mill which will be in operation\nwithin three months if present in\ndications count for anything. The\nm .chinery and lumber has been\npurchased and the foundations are\nnow in process ot construction.\nThe Bullion Mining Co. at Mill\nCanyon is working a force of men\nand have a large arhount of ship\nping ore on the dump. The fact\nthat the machinery for a big power\nulant has been purchased and will\nsoon be installed at Beowawe for\npower purposes to be used at\nWingfield\'s Buckhorn property will\nindirectly benefit the whole country\naround Beowawe and Mr. Linlay\nthinks stimulate mining greatly\nthroughout the whloe district.\nSPOKANE TO HAVE\nSUMMER FESTIVAL\nSpokxne, Wash., March 6 ? An\nimportant link in the chain of\nPacific northwest festivals will be\nadded this summer in Spokane,\nwhen residents of the surrounding\ncountry will be united in giving a\ncarnival on a f-cale equal to that of\nthe Portland Hose Festival, Seat\ntic, Potlatch and Pendleton Round\nup.\nOna of the principal features\nannounced bv a committee of 50\nbuisness men will be an athletic\ntournament, patterned after the\nOlympic games, in which\nathletics in all parts of N >rth\nAmerica will bp eligible to com\npete for valuable prizes. The\ncarvnival will hark back to western\npioneer days, too, with a tourna\nment of volunteer fire departments,\nof which there are scores in the\ntowns of the Spokane country.\nThough no namo has been select\ned yet, the event will be known\nas playtime in the Inland Empire\nof the Pacific northwest. In order\nthat the tens of thousands of\nfarmers may participate, the week\nbeginning June 16 has been select\ned, following the spring planting\nand preceding harvest.\nRusiness men of Spokane already\nhave contributed $10,000 to a\nfund for this year\'s carnival and\ntwice that sum will be raised\nduring the next GO days. Charles\nHehherd, president of the chamber\nof Commerce, states that the car\nnival will *be one of a series of\nPacific northwest events that\nservo to effect a close co-operation\nbetween communities, adding:\n"We want to make this section\nthe summer playground of America,\njust as the south is the winter\nplayground. With our carnivals\nwe enn accomplish at least two\nthings? first, we can make the\nvisit of persons from the east more\nenjoyable; and second, we can\nunite the people of our own\ncountry in a close bond of unity."\nyear when there will be leaves\ngrowing on the trees instead of\nsnow on the ground.\nCltas.

He will address the Con\ngress on "The Panama Canal and the De\nvelopment of the Back Country.\'\' lie will\nalso be one of the speakers at the closing\nbanquet held in one of the leading hotels.\nGovernor Oddie, in his letter of accept\nance to Secretary Blanpied, said: "1 am in\nreceipt of your favor, together with a let\nter from Governor Johnson, both ot which\nI have read with much interest. 1 com\nmend the good work you have started,\nand trust the coming session of the Irriga\ntion Congress will be most successful, as\nits purpose is a very meritorious an.l use\nful one. Assuring you of my hearty co\noperation in this work, and accepting with\npieasure your kind invitation to l>e pres\nent at the congress, I remain, Very truly\n? yours, Tasker L. Oddie, Governor."\nThe opening of the Panama Canal, with\nthe increase of man-travel as well as\nfreight-travel, will emphasize no more im\nportant problem ? yet laden with untold\nopportunities? than that of the settling of\nthe back country of California. Nevada,\nUtah and Arizona ? and in the Northwest\nthe tracts of logged-olT land. The Immi\ngration Congress will be particularly for\ntunate in having the Governor of Nevada\npresent to tell of the resources ot his state\nand of the hopes of his people.\nTHE POWER OF THE PRESS\nAS AN EDUCATOR\nA great man declared that nu hours of\nthe day were better employed than those\nwhich brought him in close touch with\npeople in all walks of life.\nHe referred to the hours spent in reading\nthe daily newspapers and especially the\nlocal paper. The newspapers bring you in\ntouch with people the world over and\nwith the affairs of every country.\nHead your newspaper carefully tonight\nand every night. Discuss its various sub\njects at the table, in the evening, or when\never the occasion presents itself. The\ndaily newspaper, with its many excellent\nfeatures, affords a splendid post-graduate\ncourse for grown-ups and gives the chil\ndren more general information than they\nare apt to learn at school in many days.\nIt will also pay you to read the adver\ntisements closely and constantly every day,\nfor they contain valuable information.\nA correspondent in the Keno Gazette\ntells so much truth and tells it so well that\nit is produced herewith in full:\n"Is there any real reason why residents\nof Washoe county, especially those who\nget their money from here, cannot inform\nthemselves of the fact that an acre of land\nin this section, properly cared (or, will\ngive as much profit, if not more, than one\nin the Sacramento or San Joaquin valleys?\nThe climate here is far superior, and hun\ndreds of persons are coming here from\nthere because of it. But as long as resi\ndents of Nevada, who live and are in busi\nness here, invest their money there, it gives\nNevada a black eye. Nevada money, made\nin Nevada, should be invested in Nevada.\n"An expert fruit grower, who was in\nKeno this week, declared that climatic con\nditions in Washoe county are excellent for\nthe raising of fruits that are raised in and\nexported from Colorado, Oregon and\nWashington.\n"\'But,\' he said, \'you cannot Ret good re\nsults without intelligent etTort. I haven\'t\nseen a single orchard in Washoe county\nthat was properly set out and cared lor.\nHence it Is no wonder that hundreds of\ncarloads of apples and such fruits are\nshipped in Irom outside when they should\nhave been grown here.\'\n"Another source of great profit that\ncould be developed if proper advantage\nwere taken of it is the heat from our hot\nsprings. It can be used to grow early and\nwinter vegetables. It is not necessary to\nsend away for them and to receivc them\nstale and wilted when we can produce\nthem at home and keep the money in Ne\nvada.\n"Production and profits In Neva la are\nknown. Ask Walts Brothers what their\norchard pays thnm an acre and they will\nt?ll you #500. Ask Dan Wheeler how\noften the frost hurts the blossoms on his\napple trees (tyo of which produced JjOOO\nboxes last year) and he will tell you not\nonce In six years. Consult the reports on\ntemperatures and you will find they are\nfavorable. I.el us then build up our own\nIndustries and help Nevada."\nThe article applies with equal force to\nElko and Elko county. Because a few old\ntimers have failed to raise trees and fruit,\nthey raise a howl every time a new-comer\ntalks about it and Invariably do their best\nto discourage all efforts toward arbor cul\nture or horticulture. Such people are an\nabsolute detriment to the development ol\nl the state. The worst enemy the State of\nt Nevada has today is. with few exceptions,\nthe old settler who has waxed fat on the\npublic domain and thinks he owns the\nwhole country. He has done more to\nstop the wheels of progress than any other\nknown agency in the laud. Ife should\n1 take a tumble to himself and see himself\nas an intelligent public sees him. Unless\nhe changes his attitude toward hi? fellow\nman and becomes more public spirited,\nwhen he is laid to rest in the churchyard,\nhis epitaph should read:\n"It has been my pet and priJe\nTo let folks know how fat I died."\nThe above epitaph would be suitable for\na real four-legged pig, and yet some men\ndeserve no better, for they have been\nhogs all their lives.\nCol. E. K. Place. Winnemucca\'s live pro\nmoter, is still on his Railroad Scheme.\nSuch tenacity deserves to succeed. Col.\nPlace is the livest wire connecting oui sis\nter city with the outside world. A lew\nsuch men in each county in Nevada would\nput the state on the map in all the colors\nof the rainbow.\nThis is what the Boise Statesman has to\nsay ol Col. Place\'s efforts in Idaho.\n"Plans for a local road between Boise\nand Winnemucca were discussed yesterday\nat a luncheon at the Commercial club, ar\nranged by Secretary Childs in hjnor of\nCol. E. R. Place of Winnemucca, which\nwas attended by a number ot the promi\nnent business men of the city.\n"During the luncheon Colonel Place told\nof the success of his recent trip to San\nFrancisco, where he found the Commercial\nclub and the local ollicers of a transconti\nnental line highly in favor of the proposed\nroad and willing to co-operate.\n"Max Maytield, who has also recently\nreturned from San Francisco, stated that\nhe had found that sentiment existing among\nthe San Francisco business men.\n"Col. Place has made the preliminary\nsurveys between Caldwell and Winne\nmucca so that, should the road be financed,\nlittle preliminary work would have to be\ndone."\n(From Tuesday\'s Daily.)\nUNIVERSITY OF NEVADA\nIN A DIALE.ViMA\nPenny-Wise and Pound - Foolish Pol*\nicy of the Legislature May Mean\nDisaster For the State Ex\nperimental Farm.\nAlthough it luis thousands of dollars\'\nworth of pure bred stock on hand, in\ncluding young animals which ought to\nsell during the coming season for a\nlargo sum, tho agricultural college\nfarm has reached a crisis in that it has\nalreudy overstepped tho limit of its\ngrowth, with no definite measures be\ning taken to urge provisions for expun\nHlon.\nDown at the farm there is a hay stack\nabout as large as a two-room cottage.\nIt is about one-fourth large enough for\'\nthe purposes intended. It is supposed\nto do 1(K) sheep, 40 cattle and a few\nhorses until pasture is sulltcient to\nsustain them, and it cannot last more\nthan the month oat.\nNext winter conditions will lie still\nworse if hotter provisions are not made\nthrough an appropriation by the legis\nlature, us some laud which has been ii\nuse us posture on tho experiment farm\nof liO acres just west of the agricultural\n40 at the fairgrounds will not lie avail\nable this year, having lieen ploughed\nup.

The\nfear has been expressed that to go after\nan appropriation of $I0.i*)0 for buying\ntho land, with something additional\nfor putting it into shape, might mean\ntho cutting of something from tho\nbudget of tho Is mrd of regents.

Two steer*, winners\nof prizes at Sacramento, will be miss\ning from the farm after Easter. A :\nlocal market has agreed to take them\nfor turning into beef and aroused the\nadmiration of the expert, John Gos\nling. during his receut \' visit. In the\nsame yard is a lumbering Al?erdeen\nAureus bull and a pretty little short\nhorn yearling. In an adjoining pen,\nkept hy himself on account of his bad\nten) [xt, is a big llolstein.\nHome distance away in a separate\nyard is the latest acquisition of the\nfarm, u beautiful Kentucky bred trot\nting stalli >n, <t gift from John U. Tay\nlor, of Lovelock. The gift was made\nabout a week ago. Although the pedi\ngree paiters have not yet arrived, it is\ncertain that the animal is a blooded\nhorse of liigli degree and very valuable.\nValuable Sheep Arrive.\nDown in the sheep pens are several\nCits wold sheep, the gift of the W. T.\nJenkins company of Battle Mountain.\nThese sheep have just been received.\nThey are pure breds and are very valu\nable. that is. for sheep.\nSpeaking of late acquisitions. Low\never. they must all stand aside for the\nnew lambs that are lieing liorn daily.\nThere are 38 little fellows in the |m\'hs\nnow, from two days to a week or ten\ndays old. Most of them are pure breds,\nbut there are a few crosses. It is the\naim of Profess >r True to keep speci\nmens of each variety of sheep to show\nthe differences in breeds and to teach\nstandard types. It is exiiected the\nnumber of latnlis will soon lie doubled.\nToday the students have a chance to\nlook at wool off the sheep\'s back. Yes\nterday two professional shearers were\nbusy removing the fleeces of the ani\nmals. They began with the little\nround fellows and will wlr.d up when\nthey get to those with the heavy\nMerinos whose fleeces run as high as\n28 pounds each.\nIn the dairy stalls then* is a row of\nHolsteins with one Guernsey.

Dickerson took charge of\nthe State prison yesterday. Hereafter\nthe proper appellation will be Warden\nDickerson. Since the resignation of\nGeo. Cowing, so says the Appeal, Mr.\nDickerson has been busy looking over\nthe premises and tlio Held. The man\nagement of the prison is one of the\nmost ticklish jobs in Nevada. Aside\nfrom the handling of a iiumlier of em\nployes to the best interests of the state,\nthere is a house filled with men who j\nhave lieen sent there for crimes of every j\nnature, from the petty thief to the\ndouble-dyed murderer, are to be found j\nwithin the walls. It is a matter of\ncool judgment, of pro|ier management,\nof treatment that is e<|Uul in all runes,\nand withal, there is an appointive\nboard to be considered.\nIn the last instance It is understood\nthat Mr. Dickerson is to have full\npower and sway. If lie finds that a\ninan is dereloct and not worth his snl\narv. he can bounce him.

That is why the popular American ver\ndict as to the death of Madero and Snare/, the other day\nwas that it was cold-blooded murder\nMuch of suspicion was attributable to the well\nknown Mexican system of shooting down ptblie men\nupon the pretense that they were killed while trying to\nescape. It seems that the deposed president and all of\nthe members of his personal find oflicial family fully\nunderstood that they would be made victims of the pro\ncess known as "ley de fuga," which meant that they\nwould be killed as fugitives.\nBut to the recent acts of Huerta, more than any\nother thing, did the American public look in determining!\nwhether or not these depos d officials and their followers\nwere inhumanly murdered by the government.\nHuerta docs not stand mi the light of an ideal hero I\nbefore the American people, lie was commander of Ma\ndero\'s armies, the trusted military head of the late un\nfortunate president. It is hard to escape the conscious\nness that in finally bringing about the arrest of Madero,\nwithout previous warning of his dislovaltv, he plavcd the\n? ? ? ? ? I ?\npart of an infamous traitor.

It is to\nbe hoped that the report is true.\nWhile allopathy is still the dominant\nmedical practice in this country, there are\nmillions of people who are adherents of\nhomeopathy and are convinced of the\ngood it has done them. So of other lesser\nschools. To give the so-called "regulars"\nsole power over a federal health bureau\nwould be an outrageous injustice to a large\nclass of American citizens.\nThe Carson Appeal has this to say about\nthe present legislature: "From appear\nances there is to be some scalp lifting in\nthe two houses of the legislature. The\nPublicity Bill is yet under consideration.\nTwo bills are in the Senate to clean the\nRailroad Commission and Utility Commis\nsion out; one has appeared in the Assem\nbly to do away with the Deputy Superin\ntendents of Public Instruction. Others\nare to follow and so it goes along the line.\nIt is understood that the Democrats are\nabout to put their work to the test, and\nsome of the Republicans have fallen into\nline. Just how far this slaughter will ex\ntend before the white flag is raised is hard\nto state.\n"The Democrats are now prepared to\ncaucus on legislation and the Republicans\nare only awaiting the call of their chair\nman. It is nearing the end of the session\nand also possible that the Governor may\nveto some of the bills that he believes det\nrimental to the real interests of the state\nand not the parties. Just how far the\nDemocrats can go is even questionable, as\nit is remembered that several of the Demo\ncrats ran unpledged and also ran as the\nselection of the people of their districts\nwithout party backing. The fun is on and\nsome fur will fly."\nThe following is excellent advice from\nthe Review of Los Vegas: "When you go\ninto the postoflice and inquire tor mail,\ndon\'t try to fill up the delivery hole with\nthe north end of your body. If you merely\nstand off and fire your request through the\nwindow, those whom you address will\nrespond promptly. After you receive\nyour mall, don\'t stand monopolizing the\ndelivery window while you look to seek\nthe postmark and guexs who the letters\nare from. Let those behind you have a\nchance, for life is short and time is fleet\ning. Remember this and you will confer\na favor on those in the rear."\n(From Saturday\'s Dally.)\nPLEADED HIS OWN CASE\nNlmrod Urla, Confessed Murderer,\nBreak* Down In Call When\nGood Nowa Cornea.\nNimrod IJrio, confessed murderer of\nMrs. Jean (juillici of Imlay, will not\ngo to tlin gallows to pity tho |>ennlty\nof hia crime. An eleventh hour com\nmutation of tentenco saved the mur\nderer\'s neck lust night, when the Isrnrd\nof pardons decreed that in lieu of\ndeath he shall spend the remainder of\nhia life In the state\'s prison.\nThe dacision of tho hoard was\nreached shortly after M o\'clock and the\nnews was conveyed to thn condemned\nman u few minutea Inter. Urin broke\ndown when told of tho action of tho\ntfoard, and aoblied like a child as he lay\non hia cot In the condemned coll. He\nha<l anxiously awaited news of the no\ntion of the iwnlon board from the time\nhe was asked to repeat the story of the\nI crime committed by himself and J.\n| Frank Tramner to the members of the\nboard yesterday afternoon. When\nt Warden Cowing entered the con\ndemncd cell to tell him of the action of\nthe board the murderer arose to greet\nhim wild-eyed, hysterical and on the\nverge of a complete nervous break\ndown as a result of the strain he had\nundergone in the luat few days.\nBy the action of the board Urle walks\nfrom the shadow of th" gallows and an\naged, gray-haired, sorrowing mother\nmay return to her fnrtu in Idaho con\ntent ill the knowledge that she was\ninHtruinental in Having her koii from\nthe hangman\'s noose.\nThe board of pardons went a steji\nfurther in this case than it has ever\ngone In a similar matter. The trip to\nthe prison for the pur|>ose of question\ning a murderer and listening to his\nstory of the crime for which he was\nsentei ce 1 to die established a prece\ndent.\nTramner Refuses to Talk.\nAfter listening to Urie\'a relation of\nthe details of the murder the board en\ntered the condemned cell and attempt\ned to interview Tramner, who is to Ik*\nshot next month for the murder.\nTramner wan sullen and insolent and\nrefused to answer the questions put to\nhim by members of the board.\nYesterday Urie\'s mother and brother\nbade him farewell, and preparations\nwere made by the prison oHicials to\ncarry out the mandate of the law in\nease the board refused to commute the\nmurderer\'s sentence. The rope was\ntested and the trap made ready. In\nfact, all the details except the selection\nof the guards to cut the cords had been\ncompleted and everything was in readi\nness for the execution.\nIn all probability the gallows at the\nstate\'s prison will never again bo used\nto send a murderer to eternity. Tram\nner and Mirkovich have selected shoot\ning in preference to hanging, and a bill\nproviding for electrocution has passed\nthe assembly and now is pending in the\nsenate. It is more than likely the\ngallows will lie dismantled.\nNEVADA\'S DIVORCE LAW\nThe St. Louis Globe-Democrat voices\nthe general sentiment* of the Eastern\npress on the change in Nevada\'s divorce\nlaw as follows:\n"Without ii city of refuge; Babylon\nhas fallen! The Nevada senate on\nTuesday, following tho earlier action of\nthe house, voted to make one yea? \'s\nresidence in that state a prerequisite to\ngetting u divorce there, and the gov\nernor has announced his intention to\nsign the bill. Reno, that city of mag\nnificent distances and alluring enchant*\ntnents for all of the inismated and in\ncompatible souls of earth, feels now\nthat its career is ended. That town\nalone made an organized opposition to\nthe passage of the bill. A large l>ody\nof its citizens, claiming that to break\nup the divorce colony in Reno would\n1)0 to ruin the town, have lobbied in\nlioth branches of the legislature and\nhave importuned the governor for a\nveto. Last week they threatened that\nif the women, who are responsible for\ntho meusu re, should succeed in getting\nit passed, they woidd retaliate by or\nganizing a campaign against woman\nsuffrage which would make its success\nimpossible.\n"Apparently the suffragists were not\ndismayed by the threat, and the vote in\nboth houses shows that the public sen\ntiment of the state must l>e over\nwhelmingly against the continuance of\nconditions at Iteno which have dis\ngraced Nevada, once an easy thing to\ndo, but evidently becoming harder\nsince the Iiojhj of the white race went\ndown at Iteno before a black man who\nsince made matters worse by trying to\ncarry more of the white man\'s burden\nthan any white man tns been able to\ncarry. Since that day Nevada has\nseemed to t>o thinking that ]>orha|>s be\ning "wide open" to peoplo and things\nof good repute would pay better than\ntiolng wide open only to things and\npeople giving tho rest of the world a\nbad opinion of her sovereignty as a\nstate.\n"When Keno takes her eyes off the\ndivorcee who in accompanied there by\ntho co-respondent in the cano during\ntho brief time in which they are to\nwait until tho injured husband is ar\nraigned in court) without lieing there,\nan a man lost to nil sense of gentle\nmanly honor and chivalry: when she\nturns her .attention to making the\nwheels go around in bigger game* tlmn\nroulette; when she 1 arns to play for\nbig stakes with the queens find the\nknaves in all the discard, she will pros\nper so much more than she has dono\nwith marked cards and phonies that\nshe will l>e glad to give suffrage to the\nwomen of Nevada as a testimonial of\nregard. Wo are so sure of this that the\nonly question left in tho case is the one\nof where the disconsolate can go next.\nWe can sec for them now no city of\nrefuge anywhere."\nMUNITIONS OF WAR\nMOVING \'VEST\nSeveral earn of ordinance stores\nfrom tho Rock Inland arsenal billed\nto .Stockton, Cal., passed through\nKlkn on the S.

The good natured sheriff,\nafter riding in his auto ail night\nto reach the scene of carnage,\nfound that no murder ha 1 been\ncommitted. He found that E.\nE. Noonan, who was the butter\nmaker at the creamery, was in a\nstate of abject terror over an as\nsault which probably never occurred\nHe had locked and barred the\ndoors of the creamery building to\nkeep his imaginary foes out and\nhad fired a few shots into the will\nto frighten all comers.\nThe sheriff brought the man to\nElko and lodged him in jail over\nnight. Today he appears perfectly\nrational and he was released from\ncustody. He shook the dust of Elko\nCounty from his feet and took No.\n3 on his way to his brother in\nOregon. It is said that he had\nsome trouble with a girl and U3\nshe was seen leaving the creamery\na few minutes before the outbreak\nit is suspected that the "woman in\nthe case" had something to\ndo with his hallucination.
