S. Rowe)\nEditor’s Note;—As Director General\nof the Pan American Union and the\nauthorized general exponent of all\nthe Latin-American republics (22 in\nnumber) Dr. Rowe is working ener\ngetically and expertly to forward a\ncombined effort on the part of United\nStates manufacturers to increase\ntrade relations. His article will be\nfound intensely interesting and great\nly illuminating.\nThe dream of the civilized peoples\nof the world since history recorded\ncivilization has been and is being ac\ncomplished today on the Western\nContinent.\nInternational disputes are being\nsettled before thir activities have\nmore than been born. Hatreds are\nsmothered in the cradle. Injustice is\nan unknown quantity. The sword has\nindeed been beaten into a plow share\nand this in the face of the cry, “There\nwill always be war.”\nWhile the great nations of the\nworld view with suspicion even the\nsuggestions of peace overtures that\nshall last forever, view with distrust 1\nthe hopes of universal disarmament, j\ncling to the weapons of war with one\nhand while touching the olive branch\nwith the other, there is before them\nan example of internatioanl co-opera\ntion, of international helpfulness, of\nmisunderstanding smoothed away a\ncross a table that has been going on\nfor years and with each year seeing\na more complete understanding and\na closer drawing together of the na\ntions thus affected.\nPeace and Prosperity\nWhile the great nations of the\neauh shout civilization and\ntheir desire for brotherhood and go\non with the ever-increasing program\nof ships and guns, the “Pan American\nUnion” goes on its way, bringing\npeace and prosperity to its member\nship and growing trust and confidence\nin its decisions.\nThroughout the world, the masses\nof the people are passing through a\nperiod of disillusionment and disap\npointment. The high hopes enter\ntained immediately subsequent to the\nGreat War, that the world was enter\ning upon anew era of international\ngood-will and co-operation have been\nsadly shattered. Enthusiasm has\ngiven way to moral lassitude and cyn\nicism. The resurgence of selfish na\ntionalistic and even imperialistic am\nbition an the part of the peoples of\nEurope has developed an atmosphere\nof pessimism with reference to the\nfuture of Western civilization.\nThe bitter experience of the last\nfew years has served to undermine\nmany accepted and hitherto unques\ntioned beliefs relative to international\naffairs. There is a growing feeling\nthat the ruthless international com\npetition, which has characterized\nworld relations during the last cent-\nhas not produced the results\nwhich were anticipated. Even those\ncountries that seemed to gain the\ngreatest advantage from this com\npetitive system have often found\nthose advantages hollow and of little\npermanent value. With this increas\ning doubt as to the efficiency of inter\nnational competition, there is grow\ning a feeling that the welfare of the\nmasses of the people in all countries\ncan best be guaranteed through a pol\nicy of international co-operation ra\nther than competition.\nFirst Conference\nSince the first Pan American Con\nference, held in 1889, under the states\nmanlike leadership of James G.\nBlaine, there has been worked out a\npolicy of international co-operation\nand mutual helpfulness amongst the\nRepublics of the American Continent\nwhich may well serve as an example\nand inspiration to the nations of the\nworld. For a period of over thirty\nyears, the diplomatic representatives\nof the American Republics have been\nmeeting each month, presided over by\nthe Secretary of State of the United\nStates, to discuss matters of common\ninterest and concern. Through such\ninterchange of thought and opniion,\nthere has been created an atmosphere\nof mutual trust and confidence which\nhas served to solve amicably and\nthrough the reasonable and orderly\nprocesses of discussion, a large num\nber of problems which might other\nwise have become the source of inter\nnational irritation.\nEven more significant than the\npeaceful settlement of pending inter\nnational problems is the spirit of mu\ntual helpfulness which has found and\nwhich still finds expression in the Pan\nWOOD COUNTY REPORTER.\nAmerican Union. Through this or\nganization the accumulated experience\nof the entire American Continent is\nplaced at the disposal of each and ev\nery one of the Republics. Whenever\nexpert service is required for the so\nlution of any pending domestic prob\nlem, whether it is in matter of educa\ntion, sanitation, irrigation, or any\nother department of national activity,\nthe governments of the American Re\npublics are aware that they can secure\nsuch expert services from the Pan A\nmerican Union. Through the inter\nmediary of the diplomatic represent\natives at Washington there is a con\nstant exchange of information and ex\nperience. The effectiveness of this in\nterchange is strengthened by the pub\nlications of the Pan American Union,\nespecially the Spanish, Portuguese,\nand English editions of the monthly\nBulletin, supplemented by descriptive\nhandbooks of each of the Republics;\nand special publications relating to\ntheir foreign commerce.\ni The Educational Section of the\nI Union, under the able direction of the\n: Assistant Director, Dr. Francisco J.\nYanes, is unremitting in its efforts to\n| develop closer cultural ties between\n| the Republics of this Continent. Thru\n.the activities of this section, scholar\nships have been established in the\nUnited States for students from Lat\nin American countries and similarly\nstudents from the United States are\ngiven opportunities to pursue special\n! investigations in Latin America.\nClaims Settled\nAt stated intervals since the as\nsembling of the First Pan American\nConference in 1889, additional confer\nences have been held, each of which\nhas contributed its share toward\nbringing about closer relations be\ntween the different sections of the\nContinent. Through a series of trea\nties and conventions agreed upon at\nthese conferences, it has been possi\nble to reach an orderly solution of\nproblems which might otherwise have\nbecome the subject of international\ndifferences. Thus ifaafc-- question* -as*-\nthe settlement of pecuniary claim's;\nthe c ormulation and codification of in\nternational law; the control of in\nfectious and contagious diseases and\nmany other matters have been cov\nered by conventions through whicl\nan early procedure is established for\ntheir solution.\nThese general Pan American Con\nferences have been supplemented by\na series of specialized conferences\nwhich have also contributed their due\nshare toward developing Pan Ameri\ncan co-operation.\nSoon after the outbreak of the\nEuropean War. the Secretary of the\nTreasury called a conference of the\nMinisters of Finance of the American\nRepublics to consider the financial\nsituation which had arisen by reason\nof the war in Europe. This confer\nnece met in Washington in 1915 and\nled to the formation of a permanent\norganiation known as the Inter-Amer\nican High Commission, designed t(\nfoster closer co-operation between\nthe different sections of the Contin\nent. This Commission is made up of\na national section organized in each\ncountry, presided over by the Minist\ner of Finance, and composed of nine\neminent financiers and jurists. At\nthe close of the war, the second of\nthese international conferences met\nat Washington to consider the finan\ncial situation in which the American\nRepublics found themselves by reason\nof new conditions created by the ter\nmination of the war. This second\nconference entiusted to this perman\nent organiation—the Inter-American\nHigh Commission—the further duty\nof fostering closer financial and com\nmercial ties, and this work is now be\ning sarried forward with mast grat\nifying results.\nThe first Pan American Scientific\nCongress, which was held at Santiago,\nChile, in 1908, was a further factor in\nestablishing closer cultural ties be\ntween the Republics of America.\nPrior to 1908, these congresses were\nLatin American rather than Pan A\nmerican in character, and the inclu\nsion of the United States was intend\ned as a demonstration of the commu\nnity of intellectual and cultural pur\nposes of the nations of America. At\nthe Santiago Congress of 1908, emin\nent representatives of science and let\nters of ever; American country met\nfor interchange of views and developed\nplans for closer intellectual co-opera\ntion. The sceond of these Scientific\nCongresses was held at Washington,\nin 1916, and the third will assemble\nat Lima, Peru, in July, 1923.\nMrs. George Hill, Jr., who has been\na patient the past two weeks at the\nRiverview Hospital, has sufficiently\nrecovered to be discharged therefrom\nand is a guest at the home of her hus\nband’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. George\nHill, Sr., 553 Eignth Avenue South.\nEntered June 2, 1903 at Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, as second-class matter, under Act of Congress of Mar. 3, 1 879.\nWISCONSIN RAPIDS, WOOD COUNTY. WISCONSIN, THURSDAY DECEMBER 15, 1921\n“AS GOOD AS OLD\nWHEAT IN THE MILL”\nWhen you have so thoroughly established the good\nname of your house and your business, for positive de\npendability as to gain that supreme confidence of the\npeople of your community: “Jones’ store is as good as old\nwheat in the mill,” you have about reached the ultimate\nin merchandising desires. But the road to that objective\nis strewn with the wrecks of merchandising efforts.\nThe greatest asset of any store is not cash, accounts\nreceivable, nor merchandise, but being a popular trad\ning center having the goodwill of the entire community\nRegular advertising together with fair, honorable treat\nment quickly builds this greatest of all assets and makes\nfor a steady and increasing business.\nNewspaper publicity—obtainable at the least expense\n—gives your business the greatest tonic—feeds it with\nthe most strengthening food —supports it on the strong\nest foundation of any of the essentials that enter into\npresent day merchandising.\nAdvertising works for efficiency, because it draws in\ntrade from the surrounding community and nearby\ntowns. Regular store-news advertising provides the\nhome folks with something to read besides the mail order\ncatalogs.\nPeople are always interested in merchandise offerings\nand like to read, study and plan on their future purchas\nes. They will always follow the lead of a “live-wire” and\nwill go a greater distance to trade at a store that shows\nenterprise.\nAn advertising merchant is one who is constantly\nstriving to secure a greater volume of business. To se\n--cure a greater volume of business he must draw trade\nfrom every section of his trade territory. The largest\nvolume or capacity turnover can be secured only by tell\ning the public about the different merchandise offerings\nand by extending to the town and country folks a cordial\ninvitation to visit the store often.\nPersistency in advertising will quickly build for your\nbusiness its greatest asset.\nDEATH OF MRS.\nW. 0. HANNEMAN\nMrs. W. O. Hanneman passed away\nSaturday evening at six o’clock at her\nhome in the city limits, after an ill\nness of two days, a result of a cough\ning spell. Mrs. Hanneman was seven\nty-five years of age at the time of her\ndeath and among the older residents\nof Wisconsin Rapids. She was a re\nserved Christian woman, a loving wife\nand mother and a kind nieghbor. She\nleaves to mourn her loss her husband\nand two daughters, Mrs. Henry Kline\nand Mrs. Harry Getzlaff besides sev\neral brothers and sisters, all resid\nents of this city.\nFuneral services in charge of Rev.\nF. H. Kretzschmar, pastor of the Easf\nSide Lutheran church, were held at\nher home Tuesday afternoon at one\nthirty o’clock, and also at the church\nat two o’clock. Burial took place at\nForest Hill cemetery.\nBOY SCOUTS\nWILL ACT\nPlans have been formulated by\nScout Executive E. H. Justice and the\nscout executive committee for the\ndistribution of toys to the children\nof the poor families of the city this\nChristmas. The scarcity of employ\nment has brought about a condition\nwhere the children of many families\nbe disappointed at Christmas\nif such a step were not taken.\nThe plan is to nave the boy scouts\nrepair and brighten up their old toys\nand those of their brothers and sis\nters and bring them to scout head\nquarters from which place they will be\ndistributed. The leaders of the Camp\nFire Girls have agreed to co-operate\nand the girls will dress up their old\ndolls in new clothes tor the little\ngirls whom Santa Claus might other\nwise forget.\nMil CLEANER\nCAUSE OF FIRE\nFire at the residence of D. D. Con\nway, 753 Third street south, Tuesday\nmorning, resulted in the total loss of\none vacuum cleaner. Neighbors no\nticing smoke streaming from the up\nstairs window of the Conway home,\ngave the warning, and a search re\nvealed the smoldering remains of the\ncleaner in its customary resting place\nunder the stair way leading from the\nsecond to the third floor.\nThe cause of the fire is a mystery.\nThe cleaner had been used over an\nhour previous to the discovery of the\nfire, and had then been disconnected\nand put aw r ay. Apparently either\nthe motor had become overheated\nwhile the machine wras in use, or a\nmatch had been drawn in through the\nhose and ignited the dust in the bag.\nNo damage was done except to the\nvacuum cleaner.\nANCIENT HISTORY\nAugust 15, 1889—\nMARRIED—August 9th, 1889, in\nCentralia, by the Rev, C.

Shoup)\nEditor’s Note: —The following by\nGovernor Oliver H, Shoup of Colorado\nmay give you anew view point of\nthe vast tei*ritory that lies along the\ntowering mountains of the west. There\nare many possibilities touched upon\nin his article and as chief executive\nof the state he is in a position to have\nknowledge as well as enthusiasm.\nDid you know that you have a part\nownership of 120,000,000 acres of\nland?\nDid you know that there are 192,-\n000,000 acres of land out in the “gold\nen west” waiting for those who wish\nhomesteads and who need only com\nply with the simple government rules\nto own a farm of their own?\nMore important, did you know that\nmillions of these acres are worthless\nnow because you and your neighbors\nnever took the trouble to find out a\nbout them and ask that their arid\nwastes be turned into producing gar\ndens capable of feeding untold thous\nands ?\nMillions of acres of land are wait\ning in the west for the coming of\nwater and that water can be obtained\nthrough the aid of the United States\ngovernment, an aid that would not\nbe withheld if you and your neighbors\nexpressed a desire to see it go flowing\nthrough the deserts and transforming\nthem to a great aid to America\nDid you know that out in Colorado\nand all through the Rocky Mountain\nsection there waits one of the richest\nfields of natural resources the world\nhas ever known, but that production\nis far, far behind, that capital has op\nportunities for unlimited development,\nhat the advice, “Go west, young man,”\nis still a living message\nIt is true that in the past three\nyears more than 30,000,000 acres of\nhomestead and Indian lands have been\nentered in the Rocky Mountain states\nmostly by farmers from the Mississ\nippi valley, and millions of acres of\nraw land have been placed under cul\ntivation.\nTravel by Auto\nThe main current of the swelling\nstream of tourist travel that flows in\nto the West each year is made up of\npeople who have not traveled extens\nively in the past. Most of them are\npeople of moderate means. Visitors\nto the National Parks and National\nForests come from every state in the\nUnion and every year they include\nthousands who are making the tour\nfor the first time. Most of them trav\nel by automobile and many of them\ncarry their camping outfits with them\nliving all the time in the open air and\nenjoying to the full the wonderful cli\nmate which is one of Nature’s richest\ngifts to the “West.\nThe tourist and homeseeker move\nment to the West is especially gratify\ning to those of us who are interested\nin the development of this vast area,\nfor we realize that development here\ndepends to a very large extent upon\nthe co-operation of the entire coun\ntry, and the people of other sections\nof the United States can not be ex\npected to co-operate freely in the de\nvelopment of the West until they are\nbetter informed about what such de\nvelopment means for all the nation.\nIt should be borne in mind that the\narea of the eight Rocky Mountain\nstates is 549,840,000 acres, or approx\nimately 29 per cent of the area of the\nentire country, while the combined a\nreas of the eight Rocky Mountain\nstates and the three Pacific Coast\nstates is 753,420,800 acres, or nearly\n40 per cent of the area of the United\nStates, exclusive of Alaska and our\ninsular possessions.\nA Public Trust\nBut it is not generally understood\nhat all the people of the United States\nown more than one-half of this vast\narea. In these eleven states there are\nmore than 120,000,000 acres of Na\ntional Forests, the property of the\nfederal government, on which timbei\nis being grown and preserved for thc\nbenefit of all the people. These for\nests are not the property of the states\nin which they are located nor of the\npeople of these states, but of all tht\npeople. In other words, about 16 pei\ncent of the area of these eleven states\nis National Forests belonging to th<\nGovernment.\nIn these states there is approxi\nmately 192,000,090 acres of. govern\nment land open to homestead entry\nThis is more than 25 per cent of their\ntotal area. Some of this land is suit\nable for dry farming, but much of it\ncan never be farmed profitably with\nout irrigation, and mcst of it, so far\nVOLUME 63, NO. 50\nas we know now, is valuable only for\ngrazing purposes and for the minerals\nit contains. The reclamation of this\npublic agricultural land and the de\nvelopment of its mineral resources de\npends upon the attitude of the federal\ngovernment, and that attitude de\npends largely upon knowledge of the\npossibilities of the West.\nWhile these eleven states include\nnearly 40 per cent .>f the area of the\ncountry, they contain only a little\nmore than eight per cent of the coun\ntry’s population. In 1910 they con\ntained about seven per cent of the pop\nulation and in 1900 only about five per\ncent. These states are increasing in\npopulation more , rapidly than the\ncountry at large, but their greatest\nneed still is more people.\nRich in Minerals\nNearly 50 per cent of the available\ncoal of the country is found in these\neleven states. The great bulk of the\nnation’s production of gold and silver\n|t. come from these states. They\nhave produced immense quantities of\ncopper, lead and zinc and still have\nvast supplies of these metals to be\nworked. America’s supplie. of tung\nsten and molybdenum are found al\nmost exclusively in the West, anti\nthe same is true of vanadium and\nother metals of that group. The\nRocky Mountain West gave radium to\nthe world. The water resources of\nthese western states are almost il\nlimitable. They produce a very large\npercentage of the country’s petrole\num output, and their oil shales are\ncapable of producing with proper de\nvelopment, more petroleum than has\nbeen produced in the entire world up\nto date and more than is contained in\nall the known oil fields of the world.\nREMOVED\nFROM OFFICE\nMadison, Wis., Dec. 12—Hans Rodd,\nsheriff of Oneida County, was remov\ned from office on Monday on order of\nGov. John J. Blaine on the ground\nthat Rodd refused to obey a fair and\nreasonable direction to him from the\nExecutive Office to discharge Peter\nChrist on a pardon issued by the Gov\nernor.\nA formal order removing Rodd was\nfiled in the Executive office Monday\nmorning and a copy #f the complete\nfinding of the Governor as a basis for\nthe order was sent by Gov. Blaine\nSaturday night to be filed with the\ncounty clerk of Oneida county.\nGov. Blaine in a 5000-word state\nment summarizing the evidence and\nthe proceedings which have resulted\nin the removal of Rodd finds that the\nSheriff showed “an utter lack of good\nfaith and in fact shows conclusively\nbad faith,” that Judge A. H. Reid of\nWausau “stepped down from the\nbench and became a partisan in a pro\nceeding in violation of the provisions\nof the statutes,” and that Rodd “wil\nfully disobeyed the pardon warrant\nissued to him.”\nThe statement of Gov. Blaine is re\nplete with sidelights showing a net\nwork of proceedings and a secret un\nderstanding between Judge Reid and\nHans Rodd to disobey the order of\nthe Governor in pardoning Christ even\nin advance of the issuance of the or\nder.\nTINTING WILL TEMPORARILY\nIMPROVE SILKS AND LACES\nSometimes, especially with light\ncolored silks and Georgette crepe, it\nis convenient to give delicate tints\nby some simple method. “Biueing”\nand “pinking” are most often resort\ned to. The United States Department\nof Agriculture finds that, as a rule,\nthe color obtained by tinting is not so\npermanent as from dyeing. There are\nsoap dyes on the market which may\nbe used for this purpose, or a tinting\nwater may be made by soaking colored\ncrepe or blotting paper, or by mixing\na few drops of colored ink in clear\nwater.\nA glass of tinted water held to the\nlight will show about the same color\nthat it will give to material. A piece\nof red crepe wrapping paper will eas\nily impart enough color to a basin of\nwater to restore a faded pink crepe de\nchine waist to its original shade. Vi\nolet or green ink or ordinary blueing\nwill act similarly. A small amount\nof regular dye can also be used with\nout boiling to tint silks. The color of\ndeep cream or ecru lace may be re\nstoreo by tinting it with tea. Coffee\nis sometimes used, but it is less de\nsirable as it leaves an odor and does\nnot give so clear a tint. A cheap grade\nof black tea is good for tinting, or\nleft-over tea may be used.", "Established Nov. 28, 1857.\nA. L.

The truth\nis that society has never sought to\nregulate the domestic affairs of hus\nbands and wives, or to tell them how\ntheir children are to be reared. It re\nally has ‘both a legal and a moral\nright to do these things and may be\nexpected to undertake theme whenev\ner it decides that its own best inter\nests will be served by such a course.\nSociety wants children reared who\nare healthy and vigorous, and who\nwill become good citizens and useful\nmembers of the community. If pa\nrents do not rear such children, nor\nmaintain homes in which such child\nren can grow up, society clearly has\na right to demand that they cease to\nrear any children at ail. Parents\nmight resent such interference; but\nthe fact remains that in a democracy\nthe will of the majority is supreme\nand every individual must bow to it.\nAdd to this the known truth that the\nunfit reproduce more rapidly and\ntend to displace the better types in all\ncivilized countries, and we see the rea\nson why society may be expected to\nturn its attention in earnest to the\nmatter of regulating pai'ent hood and\nhuman life.\nTHE EVENTS\nOF THE WEEK\nBRIEFLY TOLD FOR WOMEN\nREADERS\nWomen Jolt Congressman\nA short time ago, die organized\nwomen of Utica, New York, 15,000 in\nnumber, invited their congressman to\ncome home from Washington and talk\nthings over. He came, apparently ex\npecting to find a small group of social\nbutterflies wishing to be entertained.\nInstead he found a big 1 hall overflow\ning with women who were interested\nin the peace conference and insisting\nthat he stand for it uncompromising'-\nly at Washington.\nThey reminded him of his pre-elec\ntion promise to observe his constitu\nents’ wishes and proceeded to tell him\nwhat those wishes were. He became\nnettled and answered that he had nev\ner knowingly promised to obey the\nwishes of his constituents. The chair\nman replied that they were glad to\nlearn their mistake and would remem\nber it when the next election came\naround. Then he hastily reconsidered\nagreed to do as the women wished,\nand returned to Washington bearing\na resolution addressed to the presid\nent, as well as a tip to his colleagues\nin Congress as to what they might\nbe on the lookout for from the women\nat home.\nA Rule of Public Service\nThere is a really perplexing ques\ntion involved in the case of the Con\ngressman from Utica and his women\nconstituents.\nSuppose he differs honestly from\nthem in his views of the peace confer\nence or upon any other question.\nShould he stand for his own convic\ntions or for those of the people who\nelected him to represent tnem ? Is\nit right for him to accept their sup\nport and then to endeavor in his of\nficial capacity to thwart or defeat\ntheir will ? Or can he be justly asked\nto surrender his own convictions and\ntoi stand perhaps for causes or prin\nciples which his own conscience dis\napproved ?\nThe answer seems to be that a rep\nlesentative of the people is morally\nbound to put their will above his own\nin all circumstances. His power is\nderived from them and he can not\nhonorably use it against them. If he\nfinds himself unable to agree with his\nconstituents, he may resign; but he\nhas no right to retain his office if he\ndoes not represent faithfully the views\nof those who have chosen him.\nThe Regulation of Girls\nThe state board of education of\nWest Virginia has issued a ruling gov\nerning the dress and behavior of\nschool girls.\nIt approves officially of a plain,\nsimple dress and low heeled shoes for\nschool wear. It condemns light weight\ngeorgettes and chiffons, clinging ma\nterials that reveal the form, low\nnecks, rolled down hose and silk\nstockings.\nFurther the boara says: “We dis\napprove of the use of the eye brow\npencil, hp stick, rouge and heavy face\npow er. We believe in chaperones for\nall parties, including motor rides. We\napprove of th * “hands off” policy in\nfriendship* between boys and girls.\ne e leve no girl should accept pres\nen s or auto rides from strangers.

It was\nbuilt at a cost of a million dollars\nby W. K. Vanderbilt, of New York,\nfor his daughter when she was the\nwife of the Duke of Marlborough. She\ndid not make of it a social capital as i\nher father and husband evidently ex\npected, Instead, she devoted herself\nto public welfare and good works; |\nand her home, instead of being fre\nquented by the smart set, was more\noften thronged with charity workers.\nShe was finally divorced from the\nDuke and last July was remarried to\na wealthy French manufacturer. Hav\ning no further use for her English\ncastle, she will sell it for what it will\nbring.\nAnother Quarrel Brewing\nThe question of birth control is ap\nparently about to become acute in A\nmerica. Leaders in the movement\nhave attracted enough attention to\ncall down the denunciation of certain\nwell-known people in other fields.\nAmong these are Archbishop Hayes\nof New York, who argues that “the\nlaws of God and man, science, public\npolicy and human experience” all con\ndemn birth control.\nReplying.

Henceforth they\nwill not do so but will continue on\nprecisely the same footing as before\nmarriage.\nThe ruling in question alludes to\nthe fact that in many other lines of\npublic service, notably in teaching,\nwomen have been and are now being\npenalized for marriage by the loss of\ntheir positions. It then continues:\n“The ruling of Postmaster General\nHays will set a precedent in the fed\neral service and will no doubt have\nan important effect in establishing for\nwomen the full rights of citizenship\nintended by the nineteenth amendment\nto the constitution.”\nPraying for World Peace\nMadam Kaji Yajima, the Japanese\nwoman who has traveled more than\nsix thousand miles in her ninetieth\nyear to be present at the disarma\nment convention in Washington, brot\nthe names of ten thousand five hun\ndred Japanese women to present to\nPresident Harding who are praying\nfor world peace.

The fellow who had “You’rs\na slacker” hurled at him during the\nperiod of the w r ar was the recipient of\nabout the most insulting remark that\none might make about another. Wow,\nhow it hurts! But generally the term\nwas correctly applied and the person\nto whom it was said had no comeback.\nA real man would rather be dead\nthan be a slacker and all that the hurt\nful w r ord means. There are slackers\nand slackers. In the past two years,\nthe term has been used most com\nmonly in connection with the man who\ntried tb crawl out of fighting for his\ncountry, through various subterfuges.\nWe marked him as about the lowest\ndown type of citizen. We marked\nhim as the parasitic type of individ\nual who would enjoy all the benefits\nthat this wonderful country bestows\non its inhabitants without giving the\nlast full measure of devotion in re\nturn. You know the type. We all\nscorn him, loathe him and would that\nhe might be deported from the coun\ntry as an undesirable, as an aider of\nthe enemy and—in fact, we stamp\nhim as little short of a traitor.\nAmong other kinds of slackers, we\nhave the Community Slacker. He’s\nthe type or she’s the type of person\nwho buys his or her merchandise out\nside of the home town. You know the\nsort. You probably have them right\nin your own town. You know them\nas the individuals who made their\nmoney through sharing in the advan\ntages and opportunities that your\ngood town offered. You know them\nas the persons who accepted liberal\ncredit and financial assistance from\nyour home merchants and bankers\nwhen they were getting a start on the\nroad to fortune. You haven’t much\nuse for them now, have you? They\nare doing all their buying out of town.\nThey are doing nothing to show the\nmerchants and bankers their appreci\nation for favors so cheerfully render\ned but a few years ago.\nWe never think of these COMMUN\nITY SLACKERS but what we call to\nmind a recent editorial that appeared\nin the Saturday Evening Post on the\nsubject of Slackers and Pacifists. It\nis decidedly apropos to the subject of\nCOMMUNITY SLACKERS, which we\nare discussing It follows:\nHere is a little story which was re\npeated many times in American hist\nory as white men pushed across the\ncontinent from east to west: The set\ntlement received warning—perhaps\nfrom the sole survivor of the next\nsettlement—that the Indians were on\nthe warpath Its members hurried in\nto the stockade and made prepara\ntions such as were possible for its\ndefense. They had all too many rea\nsons for supposing that if the Indians\n_got in every man, woman and child\nwould be slain—very likely with those\ngruesome elaborations the Indians had\nalways affected. In the seige every\nhand was needed. Women loaded the\nmuskets; children brought food and\nwater.\nBut say there had been one able\nbodied male who refused to take part\nin the proceedings. Suppoi: vhen be\nsought thereto, he said, “I have con\nscientious scruples. Our Master\ntaught “Love your enemies; do good\nunto them. If your enemy hunger,\nfeed him; if he thirst, give him drink.”\nOf course I expect to eat my share of\nthe scanty food. I expect you to pro\ntect me from the Indians. But if I\nload your rifles or fetch your ammuni\ntion or bring up food and water, I am\nassisting in killing; and it is written,\n“Thou shalt not kill.” Probably when\nthe Indians were driven off several\nweary men would have found time to\nkick him over the fence, and to the\nend of his days he would have com\nplained that he had been persecuted\nfor his conscientious scruples.\nThat was brought to our minds the\nother day by a bundle of press clip\npings showing that the mayor of a\ntown had refused to buy any Lib\nerty Bonds or to speak for the Bonds\nor in any way to encourage the sale\nof the Bonds —quoting scripture copi\nously in support of his refusal. Here\nand there you will find such a chap.\nMostly, according to our observation,\nthey were openly pro-German before\n)ur declaration of war maoe that at\ntitude dangerous.\nThey are grafters—expecting sus\ntenance and protection from the com\nmunity but refusing to defend it. As\nfor their scripture, any novice in cas\nuistry knows that no great ingenuity\nin distortion is necessary in order to\nfind a Biblical text in support of al\nmost any proposition.\nIsn’t the parallel a nice one? Are\nnot they all alike? Aren’t they all in\nthe same boat—the slacker who re\nfused to fight the Indians, the slack\ner who refused to fight for his coun\ntry and the slacker who refuses to\npatronize his home merchants? No\ndoubt of it at all. They’re parasites\nliving on the community, at the com\nmunity’s expense and contributing no\nthing in return. They are wurthy of\n1 nothing but the condemnation of ev-\nI ery loyal home town patriot, and they\nI deserve to be treated as social out\ncasts without civic consciences, by all\nwho know’ that for a town to be suc\ncessful, it must have the loyal sup-\nI port and cc-operation of the entire\n| community. And it follows as the\nnight the day, that if some folks buy\nI their merchandise out of town they\n‘ are not giving their home town their\n| loyal support and co-operation.\nCommunity slackers are a real men\nace to the future welfare of the Unit\ned States. They don’t seem to appre\nciate that the mail-order houses are\nsoul’ess, heartless corporations who\ncare nothing about good schools in\nthe towns where they send their shod\ndy goods, who care nothing about\ngood community roads, churches, pub\nlic gathering places, parks and all the\nother good things that go to make\nlife worth living. Community slack\ners play into the hands of—not their\nfriends and their aiders and helpers\nin time of trouble—but into the hands\nof the wily, shrewd, humanless enti\nties who suck the life-blood out of\ngood towns and who care, after all,\nfor nothing in the world but the Al\nmighty Dollar.\nWe dare to call such of you as in\nsist on patronizing the mail order\nsharks slackers, because in reality you\nare slackers. You’re slackers in re\nfusing to co-operate with the loyal\nhome-town folk in their effort to bet\nter conditions. You deserve nothing\nbut the censure and rebuke of all of\nthe good citizens of your town. With\nCHRISTMAS\nFIRE RISKS\n“Peace on earth, good will to men.”\nWill your Christmas be a day of\njoy and happiness, or a dar of mourn\ning Will fire or death in your house,\nshop, store or church mar the pleasure\nof this and future Yuletides.\nIt is up to you.\nFathers have died playing Santa\nClaus, because candles ignited the in\nflammable suit or whiskers, children\nhave met death in the same way.\nChristmas tree fires which burned\nor damaged homes, churches and\nstores and their precious contents\nhave been too common, and some\ntimes in large stores, churches and\nhalls, panics have increased the sac\nrifice of lives.\nAll this can be prevented.\nLet us banish all paper, cotton or\nother combustible trimmings and dec\norations, and use instead metallic tin\nsel, asbestos fiber and powdered mi\nca. Paper and cloth, treated to ren\nder them slow burning can now be\npurchased.\nA cluster of small, colored electric\nlights is safer and more effective to\nlight the Christmas tree than candles,\nwhich children are bound to relight,\nif not watched, often to their sorrow.\nSetting the tree on a firm standard\nwill prevent its tipping over.\nWaste paper and other packing ma\nterials, coming with presents and de\ncorations should be removed immedi\nately, as also should the thre before\nthe needles become dry. Christmas\ntree fires in January are inexcusable.\nThose in charge of large stores,\nchurches, halls and other meeting\nplaces have an added responsibility.\nFire in such places is liable to result\nin panic and holocaust.\nNo combustible decorations should\nbe used in such places. All electrical\ndisplays and window lighting should\nbe installed by a competent electri\ncian. Neither goods nor decorations\nshould be placed near gas jets, stoves,\nstovepipes, or chimneys, nor any in\nflammable decorations attached to any\nelectric wires, globes or fixtures, and\nthe entire premises should be kept\nclear of combustible waste materials.\nIt is important that all exits, aisles,\nfire-escapes and passageways be clear\nand unobstructed.\nThink of the safety of your family,\nyour neighbor’s and of the fire laddies,\nwho would also enjoy a “Merry\nChristmas.” Fighting fire in zero\nweather, frozen hands or toes, injur\nies or death are poor cheer for them\nand their families,\nA little caution and prevention will\nal, we have a bit of pity for you, be\nj cause often you act thoughtlessly in\nbuying from catalogs. You think you\nare going to save a penny or two and\n| you are misled by the garbled state\nments of the clever catalog writers.\n.You don’t know, do you, what a debt\nof sorrow you are piling up not only\nI for your town, but for yourself, be\n| cause just as sure as you live you are\ngoing to find that the mail-order\nhouses are putting it over on you;\nthat they are not giving you value;\nand that your home town merchants\ncan match the mail-order competition\nevery time if you will but give them\na chance. We never knew an able, up\nto-the-minute home-town merchant\nanywhere that couldn’t show any mail\norder house in the world cards and\nspades in successful merchandising.\nHe can do so, because he puts his\nheart and his soul into his business;\nbecause he has the personal welfare\nof his customers uppermost in mind\nand because he is loyal to the home\ntown and will not therefore, take ad\nvantage of his customers in any way.\nDon’t be a community slacker. If\nyou buy merchandise away from the\nhome town, stop before it is too late.\nStop before your town has gone to\nseed and your merchants have gone\nout of business.. Stop before the mail\norder vultures rob you as they even\ntually will. Erase the stigma of be\ning a slacker from your name. Be\ngin this very day to be a LOYAL\nHOME TOWN PATRIOT BY DOING\nYOUR BUYING AT HOME.\n“A house divided against itself can\nnot stand!” If the people of a town\nare sending their money away to the\nnorth, east, south and west, instead\nof keeping it at home, that town will\nfad.\nThe God of Heaven, He will pros\nper us! therefore, we, his servants,\nwill arise and build.—Nehemiah 2:20.\nThe “bread cast upon the waters”\nreturns, as always.\nkeep the joy bells ringing. Careless\nness and indifference may ring funer\nal bells and bring life-long regrets\nand self-incrimination.\nTake no chances.\nIndustrial Commission.\nFRESHAIRSCHOOL\nIS NEEDED HERE\nThe need of a fresh air school in\nWisconsin Rapids was strongly em\nphasized by the recent clinic held here\nby the Wisconsin Anti-Tuberculosis\nAssociation. Ten children, malnour\nished and underweight, and four of\nthem in a pre-tuberculous condition\nwere advised to have fresh air treat\nment. Proper rest, fresh air and nou\nrishing foods, it was stated, would\nprobably restore them to health, and\nthe fresh air school would be the\nideal place for them.\nOf the 138 patients examined, 14\nwere found to have tuberculosis, and\nfive of these were advised to enter\nsanatoria, as this was recommended\nas the treatment offering the best\nchances of cure, and is the surest\nmethod of protecting the family from\nthe danger of infection.\nAmong those found tuberculous\nwere a brother and sister in the same\nfamily, both of whom were recom\nmended to take sanatorium treatment.\nOther findings of the clinic were: de\nfective teeth, 46; bad tonsils, 37;\nheart trouble, 10; adenoids, 7; en\nlarged glands, 41; bronchitis, 18;\ngoitres, 54; underweight, 16; malnu\ntrition, 11. Only 20 were found to be\nin a perfect physical condition and\n111 were referred to local physicians\nfor treatment.\nPeople throughout the county were\nenthusiastic over the work of the clin\ni ic and many asked how they could\nshow their gratitude for this service.\nA number wished to pay for it. Briefly\nthese people were told;\nThat the Wisconsin Anti-Tuberculo\nsis Association does not accept fees\nfrom patients for examinations or ad\nvice.\nThat the Association depends almost\nentirely upon the annual sale of\nChristmas Seals for funds with which\nto carry on its work.\nThat the number of clinics to be held\nand the number of patients to be ex\n| amnied next year depends on the\nnumber of seals sold this year.\nThat if patients or members of their\nfamily feel grateful to the Associa\ntion for examinations and help given\nthe way to show this appreciation is\nby buying as many Christmas seals\nas they can afford.\nHigh praise for the splendid spirit\nof co-operation received in Wisconsin\nRapids was expressed by Dr. T. L.\nHarrington, one of the examiners.\nPOINTERS FOR THE\nBACK-YARD POULTRYMAN\nKeep the hens confined to your own\nland.\nDon’t keep a rooster. Hens lay just\nas well without the male bird.\nDon’t overstock your land.\nPurchase well-matured pullets ra\nther than hens.\nDon’t expect great success in hatch\ning and raising chicks unless you have\nhad some experience, and have a grass\nplat separate from the yard for the\nhens.\nBuild a cheap house or shelter.\nMake the house dry and free from\ndrafts, but allow for ventilation.\nFowls stand cold better than damp\nness. Icou ci n build a god henhouse\nwith two piano boxes, the backs tak\nen off, and set them back to back.\nSmall windows, screened for summer,\nand provided with glass or cloth for\nwinter, should be provided. It is wise\nalso, to have these boxes raised off the\nground a few inches to prevent rats\nmaking their homes under the house.\nThis kind of house should do for 20\nhens.\nKeep house and yard clean.\nProvide roosts and dropping boards.\nSave the manure. It is worth mon\ney if treated properly.\nProvide a nest for each four or five\nhens.\nGrow some green crop in the yard,\nSpade up the yard frequently.\nFeed table scraps and kitchen waste.\nFeed grains once or twice a day.\nFeed a dry mash.\nKeep hens free from lice and the\nhouse free from mites.\nKill and eat the poorest hens in the\nfall when they begin to molt and stop\nlaying.\nPreserve the surplus eggs produced j\nduring the summer for use during the\nfall and winter when eggs are scarce\nand high in price.\nThe size of the flock which can be !\nkept most efficiently will depend upon\nthe space available and upon the a- |\nmount of table scraps and other waste j\navailable for feed. It is a mistake to\noverstock your land. Better results |\nwill be obtained from a few hens in |\na small yard than from a large num\nber. The back-yard flock rarely\'\nconsist of more than 20 or 25 hens,\nand often of not more than 8 or 10.) |\nFor 20 or 25 hens you shold have a !\nyard 25 by 30 feet in size.\nCUT THIS OUT;\nIT IS WORTH MONEY\nCut out this slip, enclose it with\n5c to Foley & Cos., 2835 Sheffield Ave.,\nChicago, 111., writing your name and\naddress clearly.

The United States Depart\nment of Agriculture advises the cut\nedges of the bark and the exposed\nwood can be prevented from drying\nout and dying by packing with earth,\nif near the ground; by wrapping with\npaper or burlap, or by painting with\ncoal-tar creosote paint. This material\nshould never be used near grafting\ntime, as it will kill the cut edges of\nthe grafts. It should be used previ\nously, so that it can weather and be\ncome stale.\nWhen the buds burst and the bark\nslips easily or may be peeled in the\nspring, the bridge grafts may be in\nserted. Healthy shoots from last\nyear’s growth should be used for the\npurpose. Make the scions a little\nlonger than the injured places, with a\nlong slanting cut at each end. Fit\nthem closely against the side of the\ntree, under the bark, and spring them\ninto position. K scions are long, fast\nen the ends to the tree with half-inch\nbrads.\nCover the edges of the wound a\nround the graft with grafting wax\nand tie with strips of cloth. Smear\nthe entire region, covering all the in\njured parts with the following mix\nture: Clay and fresh cow dung, equal\nparts, softened with water to make a\npaste. Bank with sods and earth. If\nthe injury goes too high for this,\nwrap with old carpet, burlap or cloth,\nand bank as high as possible with\nearth. The air must be kept away\nfrom the wound. (\nDON’T POISON YOURSELF\nWhen the digestive organs are out\nof order and a fermenting mass of\nundigested food clogs the stomach\nand bowels, the result is auto-intox\nication or self-poisoning. That oid\nfashioned physic, Foley Cathartic\nTablets, gives quick relief and does\nnot gripe or sicken. Take one to\nnight. Sold Everywhere.\nSILOS REQUIRE ATTENTION\nSilos, to give the best service, need\nattention every year, says the United\nStates Department of Agriculture.\nStave silos need the hoops tightened\noccasionally, and the guy wires should\nbe looked over and made taut. The\nroof should not be allowed to become\nleaky and any defective places in the\nsides should be repaired. It is advis\nable also to look well to the founda\ntion.\nBefore the silo is filled for the first\ntime it should be painted on the in\nside with raw coal tar thinned with\ngasoline. Every two or three years\na fresh oat of this paint should be put\non. If practicable, a coat of paint on\nthe outside to harmonize with the\nsurrounding buildings will make the\nplace more attractive.\nBABY’S MILK SHOULD BE\nPASTEURIZED FOR SAFETY\nWhile many people, especially those\n! who have teen brought up in the\nI country and kept cows, state that they\nprefer the taste of raw milk to that\nwhich has been pasteurized, there is\nno doubt that pasteurized milk is saf\ner for babies, specialists in the United\nStates Department of Agriculture be\nlieve. Baby will like it as well as any\n! substitute for mother’s milk and will\nI be much less liable to stomach upsets\nI and intestinal disorders, caused by\nbacteria.\nSlight warmth is very favorable\nto the growth of bacteria, which mul\ntiply incredibly fast if milk is not\ncooled as soon as possible after it is\ndrawm. Pasteurization, or holding the\nmilk at a temperature of 145 degrees\nF. for 30 minutes is the best method\nknown for destroying a large percent\nage of the bacteria, without undesir\nably changing the chemical constitu\nents.\nHow to Pasteurize Milk at Home\nA baby’s milk is most convenient\nly pasteurized once a day in the nurs\ning bottles into which has been meas\nured the quantity needed for each\nfeeding. There is \'then no likelihood\nof contamination by pouring it into\nother bottles. A wire or tin basket\nthat holds the bottles upright makes\nit possible to handle them all at one\ntime without scalding the fingers. The\ntops of the bottles are plugged with\nclean cotton, and a thermometer in\nserted in one of them. The bottles in\nthe wire basket are lifted into a pail\nand surounded with water nearly to\nthe level of the milk.\nWhen the thermometer registers\n145 degrees F. in the milk, the bot\ntles are removed and cold water added\nto the pail until the temperature is\nalso 145 F. The bottles are put back,\ncovered with a bath towel or other\nheavy cloth, and allowed to stand for\nat least 30 minutes. Rapid cooling is\ndone by running cold water into the\npail, and finally the bottles are set in\nthe refrigerator until needed.\nOrange juice given babies when fed\non pasteurized milk will make up for\nany loss which heating caused in the\nscurvy-preventing power of the vita\nmines of the milk.\nCHILD ALMOST STRANGLED\nMrs. G. Grab, 3116 Washington\nAve., New Orleans, La., writes: ‘‘My\nchild had whooping cough so bad she\nwould almost strangle coughing.

Stave silos are pro\nbably the more common kind; they are\nusually less costly. Many people,\nhowever, prefer the more permanent\nconcrete on account of the greater\ndurability and the fact that \'the\nbuilding material may be found nearer\nhome in many cases; but there is an\nimpression on the part of some people\n| that the concrete silo does not give\nsuch good results in the preservation\n| of the silage from spoiling and freez\n■ inf. Experiments made by the Dairy\nDivision, United States Department of\nAgriculture, do not bear out this no\n; tion.\nIn experiments conducted on the\nDairy Division farm at Beltsville,\nMd., two silos were used, one concrete\nand one stave, standing side by side.\nThe stave silo was directly south of\nthe concrete one, and hence got more\nsunshine and less north wind. Oth\nerwise they had exactly the same con\nditions. Temperatures in the two si\nlos were taken by means of electrical\nthermometers buried in the silage,\nwhich made a record which could be\nread on the outside. The thermomet\ners were placed at 3 inches and IfS\ninches from the wall and also in the\nmiddle of each silo. Three sacks of\nsilage were carefully weighed and\nburied in each silo at various depths\nclose to the thermometers; and when\nthe silage was fed down to where\nthe sacks wer their coiitents were ta\nken out and analyzed.\nThe quality of the silage was judg\ned by its appearance and odor and its\npalatability to the cows. If much\ndifference had been apparent a feed\ning trial would have been made to see\nwhich lot of silage was better, but the\nresults in the two silos were so nearly\nalike that it was not thought worth\nwhile to make the feeding test.\nIn short, neither the temperatures\nnor the chemical analysis of the two\nkinds of silage revealed any marked\ndifference that could be ascribed to\n.the material used in the construction\nof either silo. Cows ate the silage\nfrom both silos with the same avidity.\nIt is concluded, therefore, that farm\ners may build stave silos or concrete\nsilos, whichever rhey prefer, without\nany fear of not getting good silage\nfrom either one, if the silage is put\nup right.\nIt is assumed of course, that the\nsilo in either case will be properly\nconstructed, with smooth walls,\nstraight up and down, so as to be free\nfrom pockets and bulges, and proper\nly coated with coal tar inside, or with\nsome similar preparation; and that\nthe silage will be properly packed, sc\nthat all air will be excluded. SBagt\nwill not keep in any kind of silo un\nless packed down and kept air tight.\nSTOCKHOLDERS OF\nFAIR ASSOCIATION\nTO MEET DECEMBER 2*\nThe annual meeting of the stock\nholders of the Central Wisconsin State\nFair Association will be held in the\nCity Hall of Marshfield on Wednes\nday, December 28, 1921, beginning at\n10:30 in the morning.

Representative Fess,\nchairman of the Republican Congressional committee, has\nissued a warning that “the contemplated sa\\ ing of several\nbundled millions ot dollars through the limitation of arma\nments will result in hundred of attempted raids on the pub\nlic tieasury with treak legislation. Congress will have to be\nalertly on its guard to forestall such legislation aimed at the\nsecuring of funds saved by any disarmament policy.\nAlready the clans are gathering and bringing pressure\nto bear upon individual members of the Congress to support\nthis, that or the other fad or pet measure, w\'hich has for its\nimmediate, if not its greatest, object the establishment of a\npipe line into the public treasury.\nIn addition to these influences,—and they are a multi\ntude, ihe 200 or 250 federal bureaus which are now func\ntioning at great expense to the government are all insistent\nupon their being allowed to continue in existence and are\nbringing all sorts of presure to bear upon the Congress to\ncontinue, if not to increase, their annual appropriations\nIt is no exaggeration to say that a great many of these\nbin cans aie not necessary to the expeditious management\not public affairs. It is not too much to say that many of\nthem are useless and should be wiped out of existence. Al\nthough all of them are supposed to be merely administrative\nin theii functions, some of them have, by virtue of author-*\nity implied in the law\' creating them, or by outright usurpa\ntion of power, gone far beyond purely administrative func\ntions of government and assumed legislative and quasi-ju\ndicial pow\'ers.\nAll of these bureaus at one time had popular backing of\nsome class or clique or movement. ’ They rely upon a con\ntinuation of such backing, or, at least, upon quiescent public\nopinion that will not array itself against their continuation.\nIt is the old story of a. well organized movement, al\nthough distinctly in the minority, being able to obtain legis\nlation and appropriations that are not approved by the vast\nmajority of the people. A congressman is, after all, but a\'\nhuman being, and when he is besieged day and night in be\nhalf of allowing appropriations for this, that or the other\nproposition, and receives no encouragement from his home\npapers or his constituency to stand out against expendit\nures, it is very difficult for him to refuse to lend his support\nto voting financial aid to the interested bureaus and move\nments\nIf the Republican press of the country will firmly set\nits face against all such expenditures and will aggressively\nand consistently support their respective congressmen in a\nstand in favor of a radical reduction in public expenditures,\nand the elimination of a number of useless agencies and em\nployees, there is no doubt but w-hat the coming session of\nCongress will make a record in the way of public economy’\nand the burdens of nubile taxation will be again reduced bv\nmany hundred millions of dollars.\nREPUBLICAN CONGRESSES\nNEITHER FORGETFUL NOR\nSTINGY WITH EX-SOLDIERS\nWashington—The Republican Con\ngress has been neither niggardly nor\nindifferent wherever the ex-service\nman has been involved. Beginningwith\nthe first session of the Sixty-sixth\nCongress, elected in 1918, up to and\nincluding the current fiscal year, end\ning June 30, 1922, the Republican\nCongresses have appropriated approx\nimately $1,500,000,000 for ex-service\nmen. The itemization is as follows;\nMilitary and Naval\nfamily allowances $298,015,000\nCompensation for disability\nor death 397,150,000\nInsurance benefits 23,000,000\nAdministrative expenses of\nbureaus 53,193,906\nTotal War Risk Bureau $771,958,906\nVocational Education and\nRehabilitation $249,000,000\nPublic Health Service 154,646,520\nCare of Patients 124,951,520\nNew Hospital construction 29,695,000\nBonus Allowance Act, Ap\nproved Feb. 4, 1921 256,239,900\nBringing home bodies from\nFrance 31,000,000\nGrand Total $1,462,845,326\nBest Gift for\nAbsent Ones!\nWrite and tell your absent relatives or friends that you\nare remembering them on Christmas day with the one gift\nthat you think they will appreciate above everything else—\nA Year’s Subscription to this Paper.\nThey can buy anything else they want, but no amount\nof money will furnish them all of the news of the “old home\ncommunity” in any other way. “The old home paper” is\n.always welcome.\nSubscribe Now!\nThe Wood County\n•V\nReporter\nRAILROADS PLAN BUYING\nChicago,—Railroads having termi\nnals in Chicago have planned a buying\nschedule which calls for purchases of\nequipment and rolling stock that will\naggregate $35,000,000.\nTEN-CENT BUSINESS GOOD\nNew York—The largest ton-cent\nstore corporation in the country re\nports sales for the first ten months\nof the year as over three per cent\nin excess of the corresponding period\nin 1920.
