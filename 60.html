Until there is a\nDemocratic administration the people\nneed not expect much to come from this\ninvestigation of rottenness in the Post\noffice Department. Every move on the\npart of the Republicans is merely a bluff\nto hoodwink the people.\nSCORE ONE FOR KENTUCKY.\nThe action of a State in matters which\nare calculated to have anlmportant in\nfluence on its prosperity and progress\ngets a good deal more attention abroad\nthan many of its citizens are disposed to\nthink possible, remarks the Courier\nJournal. The truth is the commercial\nspirit is so fully developed in modern\ntimes that there is continual inquiry as\nto tho progress that different localities\nare making, and the facilities which they\nafford for business extension.\nAn example of this may be found in\nan article in "Public Polity," Chicago,\nunder the heading," Kentucky Advanced\nWhen Ohio Stood Still." It recites that\nat the November election both Ohio and\nKentucky voted on a taxation constitu\ntional amendment. In Kentucky the\nproposed amoudment received 60,019\naffirmative votes and 41,282 in the neg.\na\'.ive. The Ohio proposed amendment\nreceived 302.G22 votes in its favor, and\n43,502 in opposition, and was defeated,\nbecause to be adopted it was required\nthat it would receive a majority of all\nthe votes cast at tho election. In Ken\ntucky it is only necessary that an amend\nment should receive a majority of all the\nthe votes cast. The silent vote does not\ncount.\n"Public Polity" remarks that the adop\ntion of tbia amendment enables all munic\nipalities to Lavo a reasonable and fair\nsystem, and that it is sure to have an\nimportant bearing on the growth of all\nthe cities in the State. It adds:\n"Kentucky is now in a splendid position\nto attract capital. It has wonderful nat\nural resources, in the development of\nwhich a beginning has hardly been made,\nand of which tho outside world, and, we\nmay safely add, the people within the\nfetate, have little practical knowledge.\n"The State is in fine financial condition.\nIt is practically entirely free from debt.\nIt has not been afflicted by walking dele\ngates or labor troubles. It is sure to ex\nperience anew impetus in its growth and\nprosperity, induced by the advanced step\nit has taken on the subject of local taxation."\nThe Quaker City Sell-Filling Fountain Pen\nFills Itself and Thereby Fills\na Long-Felt Want.\nfFreo Press.l\nAny reliable time savor is eagorly wel\ncomed by tho modern business man.\nProbably the most forceful illustration of\nthis condition of things in recent years\nwas the enthusiatin with which the\nfountain pen was greeted. It seemed to\nmean the saving of so much time and\nannoyance for so many people that its\nBale was Bimply phenomenal.\nBut the fountain pen was not by any\nmeans perfect and its users soon discov\nered that tho bother was only concen\ntrated, instead of being dispensed with.\nTbe finest fountain pen would write in\ndifferently well as long as there was ink\nin it but, when that gave out our busy\nman had to stop, unscrew an inky cap,\nhnnt around for a filler and the particu\nlar ink recommended by the manufac\nturers of that particular pen and so on\nthrough a long process of annoyance.\nThe manufacturers of the Quaker City\nSelf-Filling Fountain Pen have overcome\nall this bother and produce a practical\nwriting tool which is as easy to use as\nif one wero simply writing with the\nfiller needed for tho old pen. There is\nnothing to unscrew, nothing to squirt,\nnothing to lose or get out of order. Its\nconstruction is simple and substantial\nand the operation of filling is so simple\nthat you wonder nobody thought of it\nbefore.\nIt is merely necessary to dip the pon\npressing it slightly, lift up as usual and\ngo on writing. Its capacity is no less\nthan the bothersome kind.\nWo feel that we are not over-oraising\nthe Quaker City Self-Filing Fountain\nPen when we say that it represents tho\nacme of fountain pen achievement.\nOnly fountain pen that never spills ink, never inks the fingers, needs no filler, can be\nfilled from any ink well, anywhere 1 Greatest gift of the year, for business men, students,\nschool children all who use a pen !\n.\',-\'.\nA GREAT GIFT\nCosts $1.00\nLooks as well and works far better than any high-priced pen on the market. Doesn\'t\nget out of order, doesn\'t write by fits and starts. Built simply and well, lasts long and writes\nperfectly all the time. It cost $3700 to perfect. Protected by patents.\n$1.00 BRINGS IT TO YOUR DOOR!\nMoney refunded and no questions asked if you are not entirely satisfied.
