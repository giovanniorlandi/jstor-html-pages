C. Sept. 17.\nFearing. that his voice, may not be\nequal to the strain entailed by his\ncontinuous public, speaking, Presi\ndent Roosevelt will take with him\non his Western trip a throat spe\ncialist. This is an unique innova\ntion in the history of a President\'s\nspeaking tour. The specialist who\nwill accompany the President is\nDr. James.. J. Richardson, one of\nthe most eminent men of his profes\nsion, who hashad the benefit of\nEuropean as well as American study\nand practice. He will have a sec\ntion of one of the cars of the special\ntrain fitted up as an office, or oper\nating room, with all the modern\nscientific appliances, and at the\nconclusion each of the Presiden\ntial speeches Jjt Richardson will\ntreat the distinguished jjatient\'s\nthroat. This will be for the pur\npose of not only keeping the Pres\nident\'s throat in healthy condition\nt of preventing any serious results\nfrom the unusual strain to which\nRoosevelt\'s vocal organs will bo\nput.\nIn the campaign of 1900 Mr.\nRoosevelt experienced great incon\nvenience from his throat, and as the\nresult of the strain of his public\nspeaking at one time he was com\npelled to call in a special\ntime he will cany the\nwith him.

The\ncarbine now in use will be replaced\ngradually by rifles.\nTHE NATIONAL ROAD.\nIt was expected that the National\nrailroad would change- to the\nstandard gauge between Laredo\nand Monterey today. The Laredo\nTimes of last Wednesday says\nthere was a rush on there during\nlast week to get all the narrow\ngauge equipment page out of that\ncity and the other side of Monterey\nbefore the change was made.

It has been\ngossip for some th:;e in the leading\nclubs that William Waldorf Aster\nheartily regret? having become ai;\nEnglishman, and- would like to b\nan American again. Astor, with alf\nhis wealth, is in a most unenviable\nposition. Vincent Nolte, in his\n"Fifty Yea-sin B-th Heinispben-s,"\npublished in Geri:.;:iiy nearly tiftV\nyears ago, speak? .f having been\nintroduced while iu England, and\nintending : g, to America, to an\nAm -riean whose nu:;;e was not men\ntioned at the lime ! the introduc\ntion, but who could probably givo\nhim valuable recommendations hi\nthe new world. \'-Alas,\' said th\nstranger, in substar.. "I am prob\nably tiie only living American\nwhose recommendation would be .f\nthe slightest insurance in America. ;\nThe\nak\'-r a.- BH\'diet Arnold.\nWiiiia:u Wakki; Astor i. not in\nas bad a . ase a Arnold. He did\nnot lu-iray his com. try. He only\naban-\'vivd it. JV.t lie made the\nchange jint at th- v. .ong time, just\nwhen the American name began to\ni b heroed throughout Europe, and\nw!:. .i ihe war was impending which\nopened the eyes of mankind to the\nmilitary and naval greatness of the\nUnited States.\n\'t he method by v. inch Mr. A-tur\ntransferred his allegiance has never\nbeen fully described, and is worth\nrecalling for its originality. He\ncaused to be sent from his London\noffice to leading American news\nagencies a statement that he w.as\ndead. American papers thereupon\npublished obituaries written on the\nprinciple of de moriuis nil nisi\nbonum, having died to Americ5s\nand with those obituaries as his\nepitaph and character certificates,\nMr. Astor became naturalized as an\nEnglishman. If he calculated that\nthe English worship of wealth\nwould win him a peerage, or even\na baronetcy, he was disappointed. In\nEngland, as in America, a man has\nto have something besides money\nto command high recognition. For\ninstance, the South African mine\nmillionaires have no standing what\never. Cecil Rhodes was an excep\ntion, jiaving been a gentleman and\na statesman.\nWilliam Waldorf Astor found\nhimself virtually ignored, save by\nsycophants and employes. As it\nbecame a fad to create the good will\nof, America and Americans, this\nman who deserted America for Eng-\nand became more and more in the\nway in social functions, and the\nprince of Wale?, now King Edward.\nat length set the example of ignor\ning him altogether. His ostentatious \'\ngifts to charities, patronized by\nroyalty, have not won for hint even\nnighthood or a ribbon. He sees\nAmericans feted and petted, while\nhe is neglected and avoided, . not\nwithstanding his great wealth and\nluxurious\nsurroundings.

Between a land shaken with\nTevolution and one shaken with\nieismic disturbances, there would\nappear small choice for the location\nof the canal.\nSpeaker Henderson\'s refusal to\nbe a candidate for re-election to\ncongress has caused quite a com\nmotion in republican circles, and\nsven the president has asked him\nto reconsider his decision. General\nHenderson, however, still firmly\njefuses to accept the nomination.\nHis reason, for doing so was because\nlie-does not agree- with the recom\nmendations of the Iowa republican\nplatform, for the removal of the\nJariff on trust-made goods, on ac\ncount of wThich he could not con\nsistently represent his state in con\ngress. His decisioi"Lshows the speak,\ner to ber at least, sincere and Lis\nconsistency commands the respect\nof all nien, which he would not\nliave if he should go back to con\ngress and oppose the very platform\non which he was elected.\nTHE NEVT()RT PAGEANT.\nSir Phillip Burne Jones, the\nEnglish artist, recently gave ex\npression to the following- criticism\nof the leading American seaside re\nsort: "1 shouldn\'t care to\' speak of\nNewport from the artistic stand\npoint.

He reports his section drier\nthan it has been for many years;\nmost of his cattle are fair con\ndition but some of mem show the\ndrouth and are getting mighty\nthin. On the subject of artesian\nwells he said they had some fifty\nfive on the ranch and were boring\nothers as fast as they could, the\ndepths of the wells ranging from\nfive hundred to a thousand feet,\nand he felt they were to be the re\ndemption of that barren country.\nHe had some irrigated farms but\nworking them had not gotten under\nfull headway yet but he was get\nting at iLas fast possible.
