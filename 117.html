The troops were obtaining\nall their drinking water from a well\nat,a homestead just acrosa the way\nfrom division headquarters. Tho\ncommanding officer wished to bo ab\nsolutely suro that the sourco was\nsafe. A captain recommended for\nthis work Privafo Nabstedt, an engi\nneer who has had considerable expe\nrience in water supply and sewago\nwork. Ho was detailed to make a\nthorough examination of tho site,\n\'and in a four-page report, accompa\nnied by a map drawn to scale, ho\nindicated all possible sources of pol\nlution at the well, and mado recom\nmendations for their prevention.\nSamples of the water were carefully\ntaken and shipped to New York for\nanalysis. Private Nabstedt recom\nmended that the area in the vicinity\nof the well be disinfected, that tho\nwater be drawn by means of a short\nlength of pipe and a three-way valve\nat a point some distance from tho\npump so as to reduce the possibility\nof debris falling into tho water and\nthat a guard be stationed at the well\nto enforce the sanitary regulations\nprescribed. Colonel Lucas promptly\nissued orders based on these recom\nmendations.

Ia\nthe opinion of the weather bureau it\nbelongs in the same class with other\n\' methods of long-range weather fore\ncasting, based on lunar, planetary,\nmagnetic and astrological considera\ntions, none of which havo any scien\ntific value. When the disk of tho\nsun is minutely examined with pow\nerful telescopes, or when it is pho-\'\ntographed with the aid of the mod\nern, spcctrohcliograph, tho surface\npresents a characteristic spotted ap\npearance, which undergoes slight\nchanges from day to day, and greater\nchanges at longer intervals changes\nthat depend on the rotation of the\nsun upon its axis and the periodic\nrecurrence of tho sun-spot maxima\nand minima. Those and certain well\nknown related phenomena aro now\nput forward as the basis of a new ,\nscience that would make it possible\nto forecast the weather for a long\ntime in advance. But solar phenom- j\nena of tho kind described have no\ndirect influence upon the weather at\nany particular time and place, and\ntherefore cannot serve -as the basis\nof forecasts. The alleged discovery\nis regarded by scientific men as be\ning only one of those iridescent\ndreams that lead some men to assert\nthat they can forecast the weather\nfor weeks and months in advance, j\nand others say that they have found J\na way to produce rain artificially\nor to prevent hail. The weather bu\nreau advises the public to put no\nfaith in the so-called discoveries.\nYouth\'s Companion.\nKY.
