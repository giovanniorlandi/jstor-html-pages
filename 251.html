        <pre>['CALL UP\nEstablished 1845.\nDEMOCRATS NAME\nREV. C.JL BROWN\nWell Known Tazewell Citi?\nzen Nominated For Senate\nFrom This District.\nAt a mooting hero Tuesday of the\nmembers of the county committees of\nTazewell, Russell, Buchanan and\nDickenson, Rev. Chns. R. Brown, of\nTazewell, was nominated as the\nDemoertic candidate for tho Stae Sen?\nate from the district composed of the\nfo r counties. Mr. Brown\'s nomina?\ntion was made by the Ta zewell coun?\nty commitee.who were empowered by\nthe other three counties to name the\ncandidnte. Mr Brown has been a res?\nident of Tazewell for a long number\nof years, was a Methodist minister\nin charge of various Tazewell church?\nes until his health compelled him to\ngive up active ministry. He is a\nnigh-toned gentleman and represents\nthe progressive Democrney of the\nc unity and the district. The Demo?\ncrats have strong reason tu believe ?\nthat he can be elected to represent I\nthis senatorial district in the next\nVirginia legislature. Mr. Brown has :\nbeen a strong temperance man all his,\nlife.lias practised temperance as woll\nas preached it and bus a strong fol?\nlowing among a large number of\nTazewell people regardless of politics !\nTho meeting adopted unanimously the ?\nfollowing resolutions:\nFirst, That it is the sense and the\nvoice of this meeting that it is un- j\nwise and inexpedient ut this lute j\ndate to undertake to hold a district\nsenatorial convention and that it is\nbest and necessary for the interests of |\nthe party for this meeting represent- \'\ning the Democracy of the four\ncounties named and comprising the\nThird senatorial district to here and I\nnow select a Democratic candidate. J\nSecond, That this meeting hereby :\nunanimously selects the Rev. Charles\nIt. Brown, of Tazewell, Va., as the!\nDemocratic candidate for Stale sena- I\nor to make the race in the said dis- !\ntrict and the said Charles R. Brown i\nhaving been brought before the meet- \'\ning and having declared his accep?\ntance of the action of this meeting, .\nit is further\nResolved, That this meeting unani- i\nn\'vously endorses und recommends to i\ntht> Democratss of the four counties \'\nnamed the said Charles R. Brown as I\nthe Democratic candidate fur State I\nsenator in said district,and we hereby\npromisej and pledge him our active\nand united support in his race and\nhereby request and urge all of the\nDemocrats of the said counties to do\nlikewise.\nThird, That a copy of this resolution\nand of the action of thi3 meeting be\nduly attested under the signature of\nthe chairman and secretary of this\nmeeting and that same be certified as\ncorrect by the four county chairmen\nof Tazewell, Russell, Buchanan and\nDickenson counties and that copies of\nsame be duly circulated and published\nin the said counties by directions of\nthe county chairman.\nA Copy :?Teste :\nA. St. Clair, Chairman.\nC. B. Neal, Secretary.\nWe certify that the foregoing is a\ntrue copy:\nA. S. Higignbotham, Chairman\nTazewell County.\nII. Ij. Kidd, Chairman Rulssell coun?\nty.\nE. R. Boyd, Chairman Buchanan\ncounty.\nD. M. Crabtrec. Chairman Dickenson\nCounty.\nExpected Mr. Doak\nGraham letter in Bluoficld Tele?\ngraph.?The nomination of Rev. C.\nR.Brown,of Tazewell,for the state se\nnate from this,the third district,came\nrather as a surprise to the local\nDemocrats, as it had been predicted\nthat the sentiment in the county fnv\norable to Bill Doak would manifest\nitself sufficiently strong to bring\nabout the nomination of Mr. Doak.\nThe nomination was simply approved\nby the Tazewell county committee,\nthe arrangement agreed upon by the\ncounties of Russell, Dickenson and\nBuchanan having given the Tazewell\ncounty committee the privilege of\nnaming the candidate. The Graham\nDemmocrats\' endorsement in caucas\nof Mr.Doak did not appear to amount\nto anything after all. While there\nhas not been any intimation that Mr.\nBrown will not receive the full party\nstrength in Tazewell county, some of\nthe party leaders do not hesitate to\nexpress their opinion upon the choice\nof the\'committee and claim that Mr.\nDonk was entitled to the nomination\nin view of the fact that it was he\nwho agreed to make the race first,\nwhich is really looked upon as a kind\nof a sacrifice to run on the Demo?\ncratic ticket in this district. It is al?\nso argued by Mr. Doak\'a friends that\nhe has been county chairman and a\nzealous worker for his party, that he\nhas not heretofore offered for politi?\ncal honors of any kind and that he at\nleast merited the empty honor of\nmaking) the race for senate . against\nJ. Powell Royall. Rev. Mr. Brown is\na well known citizen of Tazewell\ncourthouse. At one timo he was an\nactive minister of the Methodist\nchurch. He married a daughter of the i\nlate Juhn Cooper.\nMrs. I. H. Sutphin has decided to\nmove to Mount Hope and take charge\nof the hotel property at that place.\nShe will leave Grahum next week\nwith the family for her new home.\nMrs.Sutphin has never failed to make\na success of the various hotels she\nhas managed and it goes without any\ning that she will he equally as suc?\ncessful at Mount Hope as in her pre?\nvious .ventures. Squire Johnathan\nBcyd will assume control of the Gra?\nham hotel,which he recently purchas?\ned.\nWednesday could have well been\nrecognized us Graham day at* the\nTazewell Fair, for hundreds of citi?\nzens from this place went up yester?\nday morning and spent the day on the\nfair grounds. Everyone was well\npleased with the general good timo\nenjoyed.\nBurke\'s (larden.\nBurke\'s Garden, Vn., Sopt. 20.?\nMr. and Mrs. H. H.

"I\'m Riad\nit\'s over," say the mnnagors. "I\'m\nsorry it\'s over," say the people who\nhad nothing to do b ut enjoy the occa?\nsion prepared for them. "We will\nhave a better one next time," is al\nready being said by the enthusiastic\nand ambitious managers. Whilo this\nsession could have been a better one,\nit was a big improvement over last\nyear\'s, and was, in all respects, a\nsuccess.\nThe Agricultural exhibit was fine,\nand the Domestic and Needlework\nDepartments exceeded the expecta?\ntions of their most sanguine friends.\nThese departments, said a number\nof visitors, are excelled by tho Stute\nexhibits only in extent. These build?\nings were crowded with splendid ex?\nhibits of Tazewell\'s farm an garden\nproducts and evidences of skill and\ngood taste on the part of the women\nof the county. If any one ever doubt-1\ned that this county can grow apples\'\ngrain and vegetables that doubt fled !\nwhen the doubter looked through the \'\nargicultural building. Such un array\nof fine fruits, particularly apples,was\nnever seen before in this section.\nDr. W. H. Dunigan and Mrs. S. >\nC. Peory, who give at lent in to tho |\ncultivation of fine npples, each had j\nfine exhibits of splendid apples and I\nalso of grapes. I\nA.M . Black had, also, a fine show \'\nnf grapes. At this late time in the I,\nweek full description of this exhibit!!\ncannot be given,nor a complete list of,\npremiums. The Domestic department |\nwas crowded with the finest bread,;\'\ncakes, jellies,preserves canned goods, I\netc., imaginable. Mrs. G. W. Dual,,\nthe superintendent, did her work I\'\nsplendidly. The wonder and surprise :\nwas expressed that she did so much\nin so short a time. She has succeeded 1\nfinely, as has also Mrs. Dr. Peirce,\nsuperintendent of the Needle Work\n[lepartment. Her space was crowded\nto overflowing with the liiiest as well \'\nas the most delicate fabrics, the\nwork of deft and nimble fingers. De?\ntails are impossible here also, now.\nThe StielT piano and Singer sewing\nmachine exhibits added much to the\nattractiveness and interest in this\nbuilding and attrnctcd crowds during\nthe entire Fair.\nThe wisdom of the -establishment\nof the Agricultural, Domestic nnd\nFancy work departments bus been\nfully justified. They have grown al?\nready beyond the capacity of the room\nprovided, and the enlargement of the\nbuildings is already being thought of\nThe exhibit of coal etc., collected by\nMr. J. N. Harman was a new feature\nand attracted wide attention. Dr.\nIsaac Peirce had a very unique and\ninteresting exhibit of fine vegetables\npreserved in alcohol, and also a col?\nlection of bugs and insects, "Ene\nmies of the Garden" etc., which at?\ntracted wide attention. The exhibit\nwas a unique one in every respect,\nand Dr. Peirce deserves the highest\npraise for the interest he took in the\nexhibit. Much interest was added\nto the Fair by the Norfolk and Wes?\ntern exhibit nnd Mr. Schubert and his\nassistant, did much to make the agri?\ncultural exhibit a success. The sup?\nerintendent of the Agriculural De?\npartment and the whole county, is\nindebted to these gentlemen.\nMention should be made of the ex?\nhibit of vegetables grown nnd made\nby Mr. Levering, of the Pocahontas\nInn. This gentleman surprised every?\nbody by bringing to the exhibit a\nlarge collection of young and tender\nvegetables?onions, lettuce, beets,\nchard, garlic, egg plant, etc. and a\nnumber of other choice vegetables us?\nually taken from the garden in early\nsummer, showing what can be done\nby a little intensified gardening even\nin this cold county of cold climate\nand short season and these fine vege?\ntables were grown in a garden in Po?\ncahontas, too.\nPOULTRY.\nThe Poultry department, under the\nhustling and careful superintendent,\nMr. Fred Pendleton, furnished the\nusual high class exhibition. Judge\nMarshall, of College Park,Ga., a vet?\neran and accurate judge,hung the rib?\nbons to the entire satisfaction of the\nfnnciers. The judge pronounced tho\nquality and conditioning as both very\nunusual at county fairs. This is not\nsurprising since our fanciers are a\nwinning in all the leading fall and\nwinter shows of the country. Judge\nMarshall found White Rocks a very\nstrong class as well as Black Lang\nshans and S. C. R. I. Reds. Stand\nIard Bred Poultry Farms and Geo.

Now that\nthe candidates have been nominated\nor otherwised announced and the bat\ntic is on the papers and public in gen?\neral seem mute on the question.\nWhy is this? Has the public become\nindifferent to this great question or\nhave they given up hope and turned\nthe matter over to the whisky peo?\nple? It would seem that the latter\nwere the case when we look at the\nstate of affairs in our national gov?\nernment as well as state and county.\nMaine, the great prohibition strong\nhold has been bought by the whiskey !\npeople. We say bought for we can\'t\nbelieve that it is the freer will vote of\nthe people who have for fifty years\nvoted dry.\nAs the result of the recent primary\nin Virginia, Swansea and Martin both\nmachine men, and the machine in Vir?\nginia represents the whisky force,\nwill he Virginia\'s national represnta\ntives. according to the reports of the\npapers the whiskey people have gain?\ned in the state.\nWhat are we going to do in our\nown county anil district? Let us at\nleast lind out how our candidates\nstund on this question. It is not\nenough that our representatives in\nboth houses vote dry hut we want\nthem to put forth their efforts to\nbring about reform measures on this\nquestion.\nAre we going to set with folded\nhands while the whisky people are\ntirelessly working to gain ground;\nthey are not sitting idle I tell you.\nVoter, 1 beg of you to awaken and\ncast your vote against the whiskey\npeople, put down the man who is go?\ning around over the county buying\nvotes with whiskey. Honest voter, do\nyou want a man like that to handle\nyour public affairs? That is actuary\nbeing done in our county. Not only\nis whiskey being given to the drink?\ning men by candidates but our sober\nyoung men are being presented with\nbottles of liquor. This is a dry coun?\nty hut you see how the whiskey peo?\nple aro thriving.\nTo many of the voters in the coun?\nty this year it may not make much\ndifference which candidate he votes\nfor. Honest voter, Christian voter,\nlet me plead with you. don\'t vote\nfor the man whio is buying votes\nwith whiskey. You have the power\nto put that down, won\'t you do it?\nYoung man shun tho man who would\nvote with a bottle of whiskey, he is\nnot your friend, if he will do that he\nwill do other things to harm you.\nIf whiskey is wrong and the tem?\nperance people are right and they\nhave God on their side then why is it\nthat the whiskey people have such\npower ami gain BO many victories\nover tho temperance cause? The ques?\ntion naturally arises isn\'t tied all\npowerful? Why does he permit this\nevil to go on? The reason is very\npluin God has always worked\n(! rough his people. He is ready to do\nhis part but tiie Christian people are\nnot doing theirs. Either we are for it\nor against it, and when a mother and\nwife serves wines and whiskey on her\ntable and in deserts to her husband\nand sons she is violating her Christian\nduty and helping the whiskey cause. !\nAnd when a Christian man votes for\nthe man whom he knows is using\nwhiskey to get votes and in other\nways helping the whiskey people,\nthat man is not doing his Christian\nduty and we need net expect God to\ngive us the victory as long as this is\nthe case.\nON YOU VOTER RESTS the re?\nsponsibility, and what are you going\nto do about it?\nA NON VOTER.\nStuart for Governor\nNow that the smoke of the recent\nprimary battle has cleared away, and\nthe results makes Democratic success\nso sure in the November elections in\nall parts of the State, our Roanoke\ncontemporary, the Times, has taken\nup the fight for the election of Henry\nC.

With tho\nman who attempts to break any of the j\nrecords established today these threo\nbecome in a great measure Interde?\npendent ami Inseparable. I mean by\nthat that when u man\'s hrnin becomes\ntired his tiody becomes tired with it,\nnnd that when his nerves uro shatter?\ned his liody nud brain give, way too.\nI luring the trials In the Gordon\nDennett cup race at tho Hclmont park\nmeet, near New York, last October, I\nhad hud liullt for my Hlcrlot a special\nset of racing wings. They were tlui\nI smallest surfaces It was possible to\nfly with even nt the maximum speed,\nand were made with ns little spun\nfrom tip to t1|? im was absolutely nec?\nessary, so that there should be tho\nbmallest conceivable head resistance\nwhen the machine wns in motion.\nOn the day when the Gordon Dennett\ntrials took place 1 had bad these little\nwin^i put on. I had never flown with\nthem, but I knew that It would bo use?\nless with tho regulation sized wings to\ntry to compete against the two 100\nhorsepower engines that were entered\nbecause mine was only u fifty horse\npower. Ho I bud to trust to luck that\neverything would go right\nThe Greatest Danger In Flying.\nIn flying au aeroplane the greatest\ndnugir comes from the constant tend?\nency of the machine t<> tip over to one\nside or the other. A gust of wind, n\nmovement of the aviator\'s body-any\nthing end everything tends to throw it\nOff its balance, und the minute It be\ngins t<> llti downward on one side it\nmust be t ie lit- d.\nThere uro two ways of doing this.\nA mechanism Is provided by which\ntin? rear edges of the ends of tlx\nplanes can lx> pulled down n few\nInches, thus offering on thai sldo when\nthis depressing or "warping" is dou?\nu greater impact against tho nlr uuc\nconsequently developing a greater lift\nlug power. When the right wing I?\n"Warped" or pulled down at Its reui\nedge it makes the machine rise on that\nside, and the mechanism at the same\ntime pulls up tho rear edge of tho left\nplane, thus lessening the Impact on\nthat side and causing it to full.

Like an\nover-used and worn out disk of a pho?\nnograph it can but mutter and speak\nthe same old stock phrases and ex?\npressions with which it has been\nafflicting its readers these many\nyears.\nIt tells us of "corruption;" of the\n"officer-holders trust," of "looting\nand raiding" the State treasury and\nof "bankrupting the State." It is\non a lino with that other example of\nextreme intelligence. The Richmond\nTimes-Dispatch?or was it The News\nLeader??which told us the other day\nof 10,000 office holders in Virginia\nevery one working for the machine.\nTo keep the record straight wo call\non the Tazewell Republican as we\nhave called on Mr. Jones and the late\nHun. YV. A. Jones ami our Riehmond\ncontemporaries to come to bills of\nparticulars.\nWe challenge them all to name one\ninstance of "corruption" in the leg?\nislation or the administration of Vir?\nginia affairs by the Democrats. Also\nto specify one instance of "looting."\nAlso to state clearly what otTces they\nthink are unnecessary, what depart?\nments of the State government they\nwould abolish, what salaries they\nwould reduce, what appropriations\nthey would refuse. Also by what\nprocess of reasoning they find that a\nState, paying her ohliagtions dollar\nfor dollar and on tho days due, an?\nticipating her bonded debt and meet?\ning the interest on it promtly from\nher income, is bankrutp. Further, we\nwant to know about those 10,01)0\noffices hodera. Counting all the coun?\nty and city executive officials, all the\njudicial system, all the State ollicers\nand their forces, all the departments\nand all the members of the legis?\nlature, we find less than 1,000 all\ntold, many more than half elected by\nthe people or the legislature,which is\nchosen by vote of the people. The on?\nly wuy we can imagine to make up\nthe 10,000 is by counting in all the\nschool teachers, three-fourths women\nand chosen on certicfiate of proficien?\ncy, and all the police of the cities\nand town, selected by local authori?\nties elected by the people. Some im?\npassioned "anti-machine" orator in\nthe recent campaign undertook to fill\nin the army of 10,000 by including\nall the federal office holders, with the\nselection of whom the State govern?\nment has no more to do than with the\nchoice of the cabinet of the emperor\nof China and for whom, we rejoice to\nsay, no Democrat has the slightest\nresponsiblity.\nWe think the records will show that\nevery new office created and every\nconsiderable appropriation provided in\nthe last six or eight years has had the\nsupport of the republican members\nof the legislature.\nDemocrats can meet all these stale\nand senilcmumhlings by pinning down\nthose who gave them forth to facts\nand figures. Make them specify and\ncome to definite suggestions and show\nwhere the "corruption" is and where\nthey would save. When they talk of\n10,000 office holders moke them en?\numerate and tell where and who tho\n10,000 are. When they talk of the\nJones-Glass charges point them to\nthe overwhelming majority by which\nthe Democrats of Virginia repudiated\nand rebuke those chnrges. When they\ntalk of "machine" rule make them\npoint out how many of the free white\nmen who voted in the recent primary\nvoted in favor of the "machine" or\nwith the hope of getting anything out\nof it.\nThe Republicans are trying to carry\non the Jones-Glass, Times-Dispatch\'\nplan of talk and accusation.They will j\nbe answe\'-ed at the polls the same\nway those other accusers were an?\nswered. The republican party now is\nthe party of impotence, senility and\nthe sore-head. It can do nothing. It\ncould not even adopt Mr. Taft\'s Can\nadian reciprocity measure without the!\nhelp of the strong, vital, progressive,\nmodern democratic party. All it can\ndo is to mumble and mumble its old,\nold, worn song of "loot" nnd\n"damnable outraged", corruption \'\nand the like, without a fact to sue- ,\ntain it or make its utterances respc- \\\ntable. It is a back number; a thing\n! to be lau,Aed at, but to be mashed.\n?RoanokJBTimea.\nThe Depositors Payed for it I\nLuther and Archie James and Lewis,\nHoward,colored, of Bluefield, were ar- ,\nrested here this morning cbarg\'d\nwith running away from Blueiield\nwith a tine Speedwell GO-horsepuwer\nautomobile which is owned by S.

Tn3o-8 EMORY, VIRGINIA.\n\\& _-i)J\nTHE COLLEGE AND\nMAKING Of MEN\nThe alumni of Washington anil Lee\nUniversity are naturally gratified by\nthe remarkable number of its grad?\nuates who are now occupying promi?\nnent positions in politics, on the\nbench, and in the various fields of so?\ncial activity. A new justice of the\nSupreme court, Joseph It. Lunuir, is\na graduate of the luw school\'s class\nof 1878, in which were also ex-Gov?\nernor NJncCorkle of West Virginin.the\npresent chief Justice of the supreme\ncourt of Alabama, the general counsel\nof the Baltimore and Ohio railway,\nand the director of the Russell Sage\nfoundation. In the senate ot the Uni?\nted States are five graduates of this\nuniversity ? Foster of Louisiana,\nChamberlain of Oregon, Owen of\nOklahomn, Bryan of Florida, and\nl\'oindexter of Washintgon. Six grad\nuats speak for five states in the house,\nof represntatives, including such\nuseful congressmen us Sladen of\nTexas, and Hay of Virginia. It is]\nclaimed for Washington and Lee that\nits law school, "though never large\nin comparison with such schools as\n[Harvard, Columbia, Yale und I\nI others,\'\' has none the less more |\nI "alumni upon the supreme courts in a|\nI large number of states than any\nI other law Bchool in the country."\nI The chief justice of the court of\nI claims in Washintgon was graduated\nI in 1808, and still other prominent\nI graduates are Thomas Nelson Page,\nI Clifton R. Rreckenridge, lately ani-|\nI bassador to Russia; Wade II. Ellis,\nI Dr. James IL Dil lard, the head of\nI the James Fund, and Julius Krutach\nI nott, now prominent as the executive\nI of the I lain man railways.\nAltogther, this is an extraordinary\nI showing, and one which has set peo\nI pie to wondering just why Washington\nland Lee should have produced so\nI many notable men,particularly during\nla period when it was shnring the re?\nconstruction miseries and the poverty\nI of the South. The advocates of the\nI small college will, of coruse, find in\nI it a complete justification of their\nI contention that the smaller the insti\nI tution, and the closer the contact be\nI tweeil professors and . students, the\nI more the graduate gains from Hie\nI teachings ami personal impress of his\ninstructors. The St. Louis Republic\nI has a theory of its own about this\nIpuiticulur case of Washintgon and\nI Lee. It is this :\n"The kind of education that makes\ngreat men is not merely cultural,\nI technical, or what not; it is a train?\ning that unlocks the possibilities of\nI personality. In Washintgon and Lee\nI today the life of the teachers is static\nI rather than dynamic; they were anil\nI are men of small incomes,simple hab\nI its, and well furnished minds, secure\nI of their notations, honored in their\nI communities, and satisfied with the\nI scholar\'s kingdom, is there not more,\nI perhaps, in cuntact with men at\nI peace with themselves and the world\nI than in membership in a great uni\nI veraity where the inspector desires to\nbecome an assistant professor, the as?\nsistant professor an adjunct professor,\nthe adjunct prfofessor to heao a de\npratment, and the president to se\nI euro five ml ions mote of endowment\nthan did his predecessorsV"\nNow, we should be the hist tu\nI deny the spiritual influence of the\nman at peace with himself and tho\nworld und free from rustless ambition\n?of him whose thoughts are ever\ncentered upon things eternal rather\nthan temporal. With much of the\nRepublic\'s contention we are wholly\nI in sympathy. That the advocate of\nI the small colleges, is moreover tor\nI rect in asserting that there is in it a\nI greater opportunity for moulding\nI the students, for guiding their\nI thoughts, and particularly for in\nI spiring them with high ideals of\nI public arvice we have often to go too\nI far in this direction. If the record\nI of Washintgon andl.ee is exceptional,\nI it is surely due to exceptional con\nIditions, as well as to the self ubnega\nI tion of a faculty whose fruits prove\nI them to have been remnrkble teach\nI ers. In the first place, it would be\nI hard to find another small college\nI with such a tradition and setting.\nI When General Lee after Appaniattox,\nI rode his famous Traveler over the\nI mountains to Lexington und became\nI President of Washington College,\nI it was a town already distinguished\nlas the home of "Stonewall" Jackson\nland the site of the Virginia Military\nI Institute. Many distinguished soldiers\nI and citizens have lived there or near\nI by, and the college itself had grown\nI out of a benefaction of George Wash\nI ington.\nAfter the idol of the Confederacy\nI here came to Lexington the colonels\nI and captains of his defeated legions,\nI men of unusual character, fortified\nI by years of warfare and suffering,\nI who sought to complete their inter\nI rupted education. To them succeeded,\nI after General Lee\'s death, youth also\nI of unsual character, for it required\nI sacrifice, courage and ambition to ob\nI tain a college education in the South\nI in the late sixties and the seventies.\nI They found at Lexington an unusual\nI spirit and inspiring associations, as\nI well as teachers to admire and profit\nI by. Hence it is not altogether unnat\nI ural that th^ graduates of this period\nI speedily becavne leaders in their com\nI munities. The? really educated men\nI were rare, andlthese also had acquir\nI ed the pioneering spirit in the Vir\nI ginia hills and iound their way readi\nI ly to Oreogn, to^Oklahoma,. to New\nI York, to New Orleana, all over the\nI South, with its need for a new pion\n1 earing. Thus while we would not^ rob\ntho faculty of Washington and Lee\nof ? title of its just due. it is only\nfair to say that conditions as well as\nthe teachers wore responsible for tho\nrecord of public service to which wo\narc glad to call attention. ?\nIt is idle to deny. too. that more\nand more in the larger universities\nthe teacher is lost in administrative\nwork and can Rive hut less and less\nof himself to the thronging students.\nllx-Presidont Elliot found it neces?\nsary to devote himself to the working\nout of a great educational and admin\nistintivo problems and had hut little\ntime, and perhaps inclination,left for\ndirect personal contact with the\nstudents. Yet m Harvard, crowded as\nit has been, there are and have been\nraio personalities, like Agassiz, Nor?\nton, Lane.Childs ana Shalor?to men?\ntion but a few?who did their won?\nderful work of inspiration, even\nthough dOO men lisotoned but where\nbut forty would have heard at Wash?\nington and Lee. Nothing was more\ndistant from their minds than the\nthought of their titles, thoir power\nwithin the walls of the faculty room,\nor thoir pay. They were great teach?\ners, born for their places,and the men\nunder them were quickened for u life?\ntime by their spirit and their thoguht\nWere one to count the Harvard men\nin high places in nearby New En?\ngland today, it would lie Harvard ev?\nerywhere and the small college fur\nbehind, in Texas it is too large uni?\nversity of that name which sweeps\neverything else beforo it in the public\nand social life of the state. So that\ni t is not the else of the college that\ncounts alone, nor its distance from\nthe marts of tho world, it can only\nbe said thnt for him who bus a dis?\ntaste for administrative problems and\nwould find his life\'s happiness in set?\nting firmly the stamp of his perai rial\nIty upon the students before him, the\nsmall rural college does today oiler\nthe best opportunities for the man to\nman contact that counts and quickens.\n- New York Eventing Post,\nAttacks School Principal.\nA sevoro att\'iek . ,n hoIiooI principal,\nGiiiiH. ii.
