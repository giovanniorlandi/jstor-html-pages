        <pre>["Experience and Lessons of MPA \nAdministrative Law Education in the United \nStates to China \n \nWang Conghu, Renmin University of China \n \nAbstract: In the United States, Administrative Law, as one of the core curricula of the MPA, has in the past encountered \nsome problems in the teaching process. Particularly with respect to educational goals, textbook compilations and teaching \nmethods, it has experienced a process for perfectibility step after step, which serves as a good reference for China to \ninaugurate MPA teaching at the initial stage. It would be important to draw ideas from experience and lessons in the U.S. \nwhen carrying out administrative law education in China. \nn October 2001, with the inauguration of \nenrollment of MPA students in twenty-four \ndomestic universities, including Renmin \nUniversity of China, through national united \nexamination, the MPA, a new academic degree, \nemerged in China. After one year's practice and \noperation, particularly in teaching\x1fteachers of MPA \ncourses are more or less accustomed to the features of \nthe MPA, but they have also encountered a range of \nproblems. As one of these teachers, I will try to discuss \nsome problems arising from China’s MPA \nadministrative law teaching by combining my own \nteaching practice, survey study results, and information \nfrom American colleagues. \n \nI. Problems generated from MPA administrative law \nteaching in the U.S. \nIn the U.S., administrative law as a new subject enjoyed \na fast development, especially after World War II. \nHowever, in the public administration sector, scholars \ndid not recognize the significance of administrative law \nuntil recently. Now they are fully aware that \nadministrative law is of pivotal importance to public \nadministration organizations. For this reason, \nadministrative law has already become one of the hottest \nsubjects in the U.S. and has split into the discipline and \nrules generally followed in the specialized fields of \npublic administration (Neustadt, 1990). As a \nconsequence, specialized fields of public administration \nall have set up courses of administrative law in the U.S.  \nGenerally speaking, MPA administrative law education \nin the U.S. has several problems that are elaborated as \nfollows: \n \n1. Problems with regard to educational goals \nWhat is the objective of administrative law education \nfor MPA students? In other words, what can students \nlearn from this course? In the academic field of public \nadministration in the U.S., there were different opinions \nregarding this. Focal points of the controversy include: \nIs the mission different from that of the namesake in the \nSchool of Law? If yes, what is the major difference?  \nAnd how are we able to distinguish them\x1f \nI\nAfter a great deal of teaching practice and \nscholastic debate, some common understanding was \nachieved. In the first place, scholars generally agree that \nlegalists and public administration academicians \napproach administrative law from different perspectives. \nAccording to Professor Peter Woll, what a legalist shall \nvindicate is the right and interests of his clients. Law \nschool is to train legalists who are competent vindicators \nof individual rights, but not vindicators of the public \ninterest. However, administrative law education in \npublic administration aims at providing formal training \nto students on how to guard against willful \ngovernmental infringement of individual rights and how \nto effectively work out managerial decisions for the \npublic interest (Woll, 1987). \nSecond, on the basis of some consensus \nalready reached, scholars have explored the goal of \nadministrative law education. Professor Kenneth F. \nWarren (1996) argued that there are at least two \neducational goals\x1fone is to make students of public \nadministration comprehend and master the elementary \nknowledge of administrative law, and associate \nproblems of administrative law with relevant public \npolicies. In addition, some other professors examine the \neducational goal as setting up administrative law in the \nMPA by means of comparison. According to them, \ntraditional social scientists are not concerned with legal \nissues related to public administration. Since law school \nfocuses only on legal principles, law school graduates \nknow little about the relationship between legal \nprinciples and operational demands of democratic \ngovernment and democratic social practice (Pierce, \n1991; Shapiro, 1991). Consequently, it is clear that the \nmost elementary purpose in setting up the course of \nadministrative law is to cultivate a legal sense and legal \n30  Chinese Public Administration Review · Volume 3 · Numbers 1/2 · March/June 2005\n \n", ' \nquality of students of the MPA discipline, and to train \nthem to observe indispensable legal procedures and \nmaster the norm of administrative law when they are \ninvolved in public policy formation and implementation. \nParticularly in the U.S. that boasts of a high level of \ndemocracy, it seems more important for public \nadministration personnel to grasp the knowledge of \nadministrative law. Obviously, this educational goal is \ndifferent from that of law school, which is the “fruit” \nachieved by American scholars of administrative law \nthrough incessant debate and through practical trial and \nerror. \n \n2. Problems with regard to schoolbooks compilation  \nThe U.S. is one of the pioneer countries in teaching and \nresearch of public administration. However, in \ncompiling the textbooks for administrative law courses \nfor the MPA program, it has gone through a gradually \nadaptive process. The first problem encountered is: can \nMPA students who have little legal background \nknowledge use the same administrative law textbooks as \nlaw school students? In the U.S., textbooks on \nadministrative law were compiled primarily for law \nschool students before 1982. All of these textbooks are \nfull of legal terminologies. Moreover, the fundamental \npurpose of these early textbooks is not to inspire readers \nto actively think over some significant public policies \nand public administration issues in American society, \nbut to teach students how to win administrative lawsuits. \nFor instance, why do so many inclined debates fail in \nterms of traditional legal judicial precedent languages \nsuch as “what judgment” or “what decision” (Schwartz, \n1990)? Students of the MPA or the public \nadministration discipline, show more interest in debates \nas to “try what,” and they pay more attention to the \nadministrative law problems related to significant public \npolicy and public administration. For example, what \nkinds of statutory procedures should the Nuclear Energy \nRegulatory Commission (NRC), the Federal Aviation \nAgency (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration (NASA) comply with when making \nrules and holding hearings of witnesses, and how do \nthese statutory procedures affect the capability of each \nagency to put forth precautionary functions, including \npreventing another Three Mile Island Event, another \nairplane collision and another distressful traffic tragedy? \n(Warren, 1996). \nObviously, it is impossible to “mechanically” \nuse administrative law textbooks of law departments \nwithout taking into account the factors concerned as \nmentioned above. (Barry and Whitcomb, 1987; Carter, \n1983; Cooper, 1988; Heffron and McFeeley, 1983). In \nthe 1990s, Professor Kenneth F Warren of the Political \nScience Department at St. Louis University began to \ncompile administrative law textbooks for  students of \nnon-law majors. His Administrative Law in the Political \nSystem has been very popular among scholars and \nstudents. Its third edition is an attempt by social \nscientists to satisfy the demands of the public \nadministration sector for popular administrative law \nteaching materials. This book aims at introducing \nstudents to the status administrative law enjoys in the \nAmerican political system, especially the influence, \ninstruction and restrictive effects that administrative law \nmay have when administrative organization stipulates \nprocedural rules by operation of law. With regard to \ntraditional administrative regulation subjects (such as \nenacting of law, release of order, judicial review of \nadministrative behavior), this textbook is the only one \nthat uses non-professional language, and takes into \naccount the requirement of social science students. \nProfessor Kenneth F .Warren summarized \nsome features of MPA administrative law textbook \ncompilation as follows: (1) The textbooks shall be \ncomposed by social scientists particularly for students of \nsocial science; (2) The textbooks are not introductory \nbooks of legal background knowledge; (3) Combining \nlaw and social science helps people understand the \nessence of administrative law; (4) The case analysis \nmethod usually used in the textbooks for law school is \nadopted, which makes the elusive administrative law \ntopics easier to understand; (5) The textbooks adopt \nanalytical methods familiar to social sciences students \nso that they can approach administrative law from the \nperspective of the American political system; (6) The \nadministrative law topics (such as drafting, completion \nand supervision of police policy) that are closely related \nto social science are presented; (7) Viewpoints prevalent \nin the 1990s are utilized in examining the development \nof administrative law (Warren, 1996). \n \n3. Problems with regard to the way of thinking of \nteaching or teaching methods \nThe teaching methods for MPA administrative law \ncourses have also experienced a gradual transformation. \nAt the very beginning, the teaching was completely in \naccordance to that of law school, namely the teaching \nmethod led by case analysis. In consequence, students \nwere dissatisfied and teachers were at a loss. \nFor this reason, scholars started to adopt the \nteaching method and way of thinking about non-legal \ncases to adapt to the teaching of administrative law for \nMPA students. They gradually discovered that the core \nproblem in administrative law study is how to connect \nadministrative law with real public policy; therefore it \nrequires a research method and way of thinking which is \ndifferent from that of law school which merely \nunderlines specific administrative cases. For \nexample\x1fin the book Focal Points of Administrative \nLaw, which is about broadcasting control, Krasnow et \nal. point out that a strict and systematic method is \nneeded to conduct research on control behavior. They \ncomment: “It is evident that with only a little effort \npeople can fully comprehend the system of broadcasting \nmanagement, such as management of some influential \nbroadcasting. This does not mean that people are \nunwilling to comprehend the management problem of \nConghu / Administrative Law Education in the United States to China 31\n \n', "broadcasting, but they hate to use language of analytical \nprocedure to interpret it.” (Krasnow et al., 1982) \nLikewise, Warren put forward a similar \nteaching method, that is, a systematic and theoretic \nanalytical method. With this method, reasonable \nassumptions are made of various independent and \ninterdependent factors in the model. For instance, the \ninfluence from both interest groups and administrative \nagencies should be considered when forming statutes \nand regulations. Since its debut, this systematic method \nhas been widely applied with success. Systematic theory \nhas offered a very clear analytical framework or model \nfor beginners to understand how political participants \n(usually called political actors) associate with other \ninstitutions. For the benefit of research and description, \ninvestigators and compilers further define the \nconnotation of “system,” namely, a concept that may \nhave macroscopic and microscopic tiers: it can be \napplied to the study of a small town’s major policies\x1for \nto the study of a certain state in an international context. \nAs summarized by Warren (1991): for our \npurposes\x1fwe can take this system frame as an \nanalytical tool and put the administration system into \nthis structure for inspection. Moreover, we can also \nverify the complicated roles that administrative \norganizations are playing in the American political \nsystem. \n \n4. Problems with regard to MBA and MPA courses \nBoth the MBA and MPA represent high-level \nprofessional education. American scholars, considering \nthe difference between business and public sector \ncareers, have worked toward different course settings \nfor the two programs. However, along with the \ncontinual outspread of executive authority and continual \ninnovation of administrative systems in the U.S., and \nparticularly in company with the continual innovation of \nmanagement theory\x1fscholars discovered that there \nwere more and more similarities shared by both MBA \nand MPA courses. Although there exist great differences \nwith regard to the objects and goals of the two sectors, \nadministrators of the public sector and the private sector \nshare many more similarities in respect to work \nresponsibility than might be expected. In some \ncircumstances, their  undergraduate programs are the \nsame, but they differ in specialized fields. Master of \nBusiness Administration (MBA) and Master of Public \nAdministration (MPA) programs have become more and \nmore popular of late. Although the MBA pays more \nattention to management of the private sector, we cannot \ndeny the fact that the MBA and MPA courses are very \nsimilar. Because of the high correlation between the two \nprograms, there even emerged joint-degree programs for \nthe MBA-MPA, where students of either concentration \nare to complete the same core curricula (such as \norganization theory and conduct, microeconomics and \nmacroeconomics). MBA and MPA students will be the \nfuture leaders in the private and public sectors, and they \nmust be trained in fields like public finance, accounting, \nadministrative law, human resource management and \nmanagement information systems. \nApparently, administrative law has already \nbecome a practice-oriented course in the U.S. On one \nhand, future business managers should not only be \nfamiliar with the internal managerial skills, but also \nhave expertise as to private and public relationships; on \nthe other hand, research on administrative law is \nprimarily conducted on the basis of relations deriving \nfrom executive authority. As government control and \nmanagement in the U.S. is now very complicated and \nsophisticated, study on the relation between government \nand the governed has been an intriguing topic. In recent \nyears, many Americans have even begun to challenge \nthe validity of administration's position (Spicer and \nTerry, 1993). Therefore, American students regard \nadministrative law as an important course that they have \nto study (Pierce, 1991; Warren, 1996). \n \nII  Lessons \nThe problems that MPA programs have encountered in \nsetting up administrative law courses in the U.S. provide \nus with a good chance to reflect upon our own \ndifficulties. Especially in present day, when we are \nfocusing managing state affairs by the rule of law, \neducation in administrative law is of great significance. \nAnd this is the very reason why I want to borrow ideas \nfrom the experience and lessons of the U.S. and present \nmy own opinions about MPA administrative law \nteaching in China. \n \n1. Educational goal should be different from those of \nthe law department \nThe educational goal of Chinese MPA administrative \nlaw teaching is to cultivate the legal sense of MPA \nstudents and train them to adopt an analytical mode of \nadministrative law and think about problems related to \npublic policy and public administration, as well as \nadministrative enactment of law. In fact, our MPA \neducation is to improve public administration staff’s \ncomprehensive quality, and the capability to administer \naccording to law is an important indicator.  It is the \nrequirement for following up and implementing cardinal \npolicies and strategies of “managing state affairs by \noperation of law” and propelling standardization and \nlegislation of governmental works, and the challenge of \nWTO accession in terms of enhancement of \ngovernmental capability to accommodate to \ninternational rules. Public servants need to take on a \nrelatively strong legal sense, consciousness of regulation \nand a concept of democracy. In their work, they must \nstrictly comply with work rules and perform duties and \nexecute public affairs in accordance with stipulated \nresponsibility purview and procedures. They shall carry \nout law sternly, justly and civilized, and create an open, \njust, uncorrupted and high-effective administration \nenvironment for the public. They shall firmly resist ugly \nphenomena such as not complying with the law, not \nseverely executing the law, not investigating violation of \n32  Chinese Public Administration Review · Volume 3 · Numbers 1/2 · March/June 2005\n \n", ' \nlaws; they must avoid breaking the law while carrying \nout the law, substituting law with authority, and so on. \nIt is obvious that such a teaching goal is totally \ndifferent from that of law school.  So we should develop \na new teaching method, way of thinking and curricula \nsuitable for MPA students. \n \n2. Issues with regard to textbook compilation \nNowadays, almost all of the pilot MPA programs are \noccupied with compiling or translating their own \ntextbooks. Some people think this is just a waste of \nresources to some extent, while others believe that at the \ninitial stage of MPA education this waste is inevitable. \nIn my opinion, at present textbooks are principally \ncompiled by publishing houses in China, the market has \nits own rules, and the operation of publishing houses can \nbe assessed by the market. Yet scholars and teachers \nshould be ethically responsible. They should fully \nconsider the practical situation of MPA students, \nadequately draw experience and lessons from American \npractice and work out really applicable textbooks. \nMost of the current MPA administrative law \ntextbooks are compiled according to the structure of \nadministrative law textbooks used by law schools, and \nthe contents are almost the same.  Of course, the \ncompilers of MPA administrative law textbooks are \nthose who used to compile administrative law textbooks \nfor law schools. I understand that it is extremely \ndemanding to design new courses, but I personally \nbelieve that compilers should try to visualize the \ncharacteristics of public administrations. \nThese characteristics include: cases and \ntheories in the field of public administration, and public \nadministration terminologies; more materials about \nadministrative execution of law and public policy \nprocesses, as well as the rights, obligations and duties of \npublic institutions and public servants; and an \ninstitutional approach. It is admirable that there are \nalready some pioneers in this respect. \n \n3. A combined method \nOur traditional “spoon-feed” teaching method is \ndefinitely inappropriate to MPA students who already \nhave work experience; therefore, we need a more \nflexible and diversified teaching method. It is also \nevident that pure case teaching is not easy for the \nstudents who are not well-trained in law and thus lack \nrelevant legal background knowledge. Many professors \nwho come back from abroad prefer a Western-style \nteaching method, namely, to assign students substantive \nChinese and English materials, then students present \ntheir opinions and teachers make comments. This \nmethod is also not very beneficial. I believe that in the \nteaching process teachers must take full consideration of \nthe working environment of these students, and they \nmust draw on the thinking pattern of systematic theory \nin exposition of contents. That is to say, the teaching \nshould start from the systems familiar to the students, \nand then carry out analyses on the surrounding \nenvironment based upon this system, and gradually \nintroduce theory and cases of administrative law, instead \nof the usual order of concept, characteristics, principles, \ntypes and cases. The relationship of cases to theory is \nalso not advisable, because MPA students are more \nfamiliar with the specific system, despite the fact that \nsome systems are displayed in the form of cases \nthemselves. In the meantime, teachers should encourage \ngroup discussion, and conduct legal analyses on this \nproblem in order to make theoretical conclusions. \nI have tested different teaching methods and \ndiscovered that the results yielded are noticeably \ndifferent. In my surveys, particularly in the discussion \nwith MPA students about teaching methods, I found that \nstudents mostly prefer the teaching pattern which starts \nwith system, then leads in concept and principle to \ndiscussion of problems from the point of view of law, \nand then back to theoretical analysis of specific systems. \nOne of the advantages for Chinese administrative law \nteaching is that there are a great number of court cases \nin China. However, unlike the law department, we \ncannot place stress on the detailed analysis of a case \nitself and find out the probability of victory or defeat for \nboth litigants. What we should do is to analyze the \nproblems existing in public policy and administrative \nexecution of law through cases. \n \n4. Issues with regard to setting up administrative law \ncourses for MBA and MPA Programs \nAs noted earlier, public administration and business \nadministration programs in the U.S. share more and \nmore features. As is now well-known, public \nadministration and business administration in the U.S. \nhave been borrowing managerial experiences and \nmethods from each other. In China, such an interaction \nbetween the two fields is unprecedented right now. \nAlthough it is difficult to say whether such a \nphenomenon will expand to other countries and regions, \nassuredly the cross reference of management methods in \nthe public domain and private sectors has more \nadvantages than disadvantages. \nWhat we can learn from this is that both MPA \nand MBA students should pay attention to \nadministrative problems such as government’s \nadministration according to law, public policy \nestablishment and implementation, providing subsidies \nfor administrative conducts, and so on.  It is because of \nthis that public-private relations is a essential topic in \nour society. \n \nAuthor \n \nWang Conghu is a Lecturer in Administrative Law in \nthe School of Public Administration at Renmin \nUniversity in Beijing.
