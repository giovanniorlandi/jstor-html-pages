        <pre>['Before newspapers and the telegraph: information distribution\nin Livland more than two hundred years ago\nBruno Martuzāns\nInstitute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Latvia\nABSTRACT\nThis paper concerns information dissemination in the Livland province\nof the Russian Empire at the turn of the eighteenth and the nineteenth\ncenturies, when its rulers sent their orders to the provincial capital, Riga,\nby horse post. In Riga they were translated into German, and the\nancient network of information dissemination used by the Lutheran\nChurch was engaged. The orders of both the Empire and provincial\nrulers were delivered to Lutheran pastors, who announced this\ninformation to their parishes from the pulpit, speaking in Latvian or\nEstonian so as to be understood by local peasants (serfs), and allowed\nthe texts to circulate around the manors of the parish. The infrastructure\nof the information network, its maintenance and threats, the speed of\ninformation distribution, information safety and security, and the fight\nagainst the delivery of false information are all topics of consideration. It\nis then concluded that information technology has changed drastically\nthroughout time, but the problems it confronts remain quite similar.\nKEYWORDS\nLivland; information\ndissemination; information\nsecurity; horse post;\nperlustration; fake\ninformation\nThe progress of civilisation has always been and still is based on the transmission and\ndistribution of information. In the beginning, methods of direct exchange were used,\nprofiting from the recent development of human language. The establishing of communities\nlarger than families created the necessity for the dissemination of information shared by the\nentire community — behavioural standards, religious beliefs, problems of defence, educational\ninformation, or important news. The exchange of information in writing was\nessential for the emergence of larger states; for them, the speed of information distribution in\nthe entire state became important, especially for delivery of orders from officialdom.\nThe information distribution system that Cyrus II of Persia created for his empire in the\nsixth century BC is widely recognised as the best of the ancient period. This was a multi-node\nsystem that transferred messages from one node to another by couriers on horseback, who\neach relayed information between two nodes. A rather similar multi-node system — horse\npost — was developed later in many countries. The present paper considers the system for\ndissemination and distribution of official information in Livland, now part of Latvia and\nEstonia; the system that was based on the horse post network functioned well before the\nappearance of newspapers or other modern means of communication, and it continued to\nwork in later periods. The system informed all people, including peasants (serfs), about the\nofficial decisions of the rulers.\nLibrary & Information History 36.2 (2020): 116–134\nDOI: 10.3366/lih.2020.0020\n© 2020 CILIP\nwww.euppublishing.com/lih\n', 'The goal of this paper is to analyse this system from the point of view of those living in the\nInformation Age, and the extent to which the much-discussed problems of the present day,\nsuch as infrastructure maintenance and threats, information storage, communication speed,\nsecurity, the fight against fake information, content control, creation, etc., were significant for\ninformation delivery and dissemination in Livland two hundred years ago, and also whether\nthere were similar problems, whether they were solvable and how, and whether a solution was\neventually found.\nIn Livland, information dissemination by horse post was expanded in the seventeenth\ncentury, when the territory was a part of the Kingdom of Sweden. The development\ncontinued into the eighteenth century, when Livland and its centre in the city of Riga became\na province of the Russian Empire after the Great Nordic War (1700–21). The Empire\nexploited existing post routes between its capital, St Petersburg, and Riga to inform provincial\nofficials about laws and orders of the Tsar that had to be executed. As Riga became an\nimportant seaport for the exports and imports of the Empire, the trade community used the\nroute to exchange information. Additionally, a postal exchange with Western Europe from\nRiga via Memel and Warsaw was organised.\nAt that time the rural society in Livland was split between the ruling class of landowning\nnobility and the serfs. The landholders were mainly Germans following the annexation of the\nterritory by the Russian Empire after the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. German remained the\ndominant language in the province, despite the fact that imperial laws and orders were\nproduced in Russian.\nThe province consisted of nine districts in 1796, of which four were inhabited mainly by\nLatvian serfs (today these districts are part of Latvia) and five by Estonian serfs (now part of\nEstonia). Serfdom established not only economic disparities between the serfs and their lords\nbut also language barriers that formed three different information spaces in which each social\ngroup lived. The majority of the population adhered to the Evangelical Lutheran Church,\nwhich in effect acted as an information bridge between the landlords and the serfs, and to\nsome extent united society as a whole.\nThe Church not only disseminated religious information but for a long time was also an\nessential source of secular information for peasants. The pastors were ethnic Germans, but as\nthe Lutheran Church held services in the vernacular language of the worshippers within its\ncongregations, the pastors tried to acquire command of these languages. Some of them were\nreally successful, and they created the first grammars, vocabularies, and printed texts for\nLatvian and Estonian languages.\nThe period considered in this paper is the turn of the nineteenth century, when the First\nIndustrial Revolution was flourishing in Western Europe. It also influenced Livland and\nRussia proper, though its progress there was not very impressive. It was clear that serfdom\nhindered the development of the industry. The landholders were happy with the existing\nsystem. They merely created some small workshops or manufacturing centres with their\npeasants as the workforce to produce tar, saltpetre, bricks, lime, etc. for additional income.\nOne popular and profitable business was the distillation of brandy from grains, which was\npractised even in the frequent years of poor harvest.\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, information about the Enlightenment movement\nin Western Europe reached the German community of Livland. Some books based\non humanism and ideas of liberty were published, criticising serfdom and the Church’s\nsupport for it. Garlieb Helwig Merkel’s book about the Latvians and J. C. Petri’s book\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 117\n', 'about the Estonians were the most prominent among them.1 It should be acknowledged\nthat Enlightenment ideas also influenced Tsar Alexander I, who abolished serfdom\nin the Baltic provinces of the Empire — Estland in 1815, Courland in 1817, and Livland\nin 1819.\nThe previous system whereby the serfs were identified by their first name and farm name\nwas no longer consistent because the emancipated peasants might leave their farms and had\nto acquire family names. In Livland this process was completed around the end of the 1830s.\nNow the former serfs became persons who could participate in information distribution\nindividually, for example to conclude contracts or receive letters.\nThe emancipation of the serfs stimulated a positive attitude among enlightened\nGermans towards the languages and cultures of the local people and intensified\ninvestigations of and publications about these fields. Latvians and Estonians now were\nconfronted with a historic decision — whether to shape their own nations or to become\nGermans or Russians.\nThe new situation caused a need for new methods of information distribution, and,\nconversely, new approaches to information distribution made it possible to solve various tasks\nbetter. One novel development was the newspapers that started to take a place in the delivery\nof information: the first weekly newspaper published in the Latvian language began in 1822,\nand a regular Estonian-language newspaper appeared in 1857 after some less successful\nattempts (1806, 1821–23). The situation with the German newspapers was better: two\nGerman newspapers that published official information and provincial business news were\nprinted in Riga at the end of the eighteenth century.\nFor additional information about the history of Livland consult, for example, the books of\nA. Plakans or M. Kalnins.2\nThe distribution and dissemination network of official information\nA regular exchange of information between Riga and St Petersburg was established in 1714 by\norder of the Tsar, and the backbone of the official information system was the horse post.\nTwice a week the official and private post was dispatched from each of these cities and reached\nthe other city in four days.3 The transporting of travellers along post routes also was organised\nat that time, and helped increase the profitability of the post lines. The comprehensive source\nfor the history of the postal service’s development in Livland during the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries is Pārsla Pētersone’s doctoral thesis.4\nIt took some time to create a functioning system with the horse post as its principal\nelement for delivering the official decisions of the governing bodies to all citizens of Livland,\nincluding those of the lowest estate. The system is perfectly described in a paper by Mati Laur,\nwho notes that the basic rules were established in 1762.5\nThe provincial government of Livland received decress instituted by imperial-level officials\nby horse post; it then translated into German those that were concerned with provincial\nmatters and distributed them, together with its own orders. The government printed the\nnecessary documents and sent a separate copy, named a ‘patent’, to each parish and to each of\nthe essential provincial institutions. In 1765 there were 102 parishes and 882 manors in\nLivland, with the exception of the island of Oesel (now Saaremaa).6 so in total about 200 to\n250 copies of the patents should have been printed.\n118 B. MARTUZĀNS\n', 'The copies for the parishes went to the post stations selected for each parish, where twice a\nweek a parish courier received the appropriate postal packages with patents, instructions from\nother relevant, competent authorities and private letters, which he then delivered to the\npastor of the parish. Each manor of the parish regularly appointed such a courier for a period\nof time proportional to the size (and value) of the cultivated land of the manor measured in\nploughs or Hakenzahl.\nThe pastor then registered all documents upon receipt and allowed them to circulate\naround all the manors of the parish, except for those documents that were addressed to him\npersonally. The responsible persons of each manor had to read each document and to make\nan inscription to confirm that the manor now knew the order. Finally, the document would\nbe immediately sent to the next manor with a courier. The sequence of manors in this\ncirculation might be established over a long period of time. The manor owners were fined if\nthey were too slow in distributing the documents.\nOnce a document had circulated around all the parish manors, it was returned to the\npastorate and deposited in the parish archive. The pastor of Löser (now Liezere) parish,\nHermann Friedrich Tiebe, carefully described in his book all the activities a pastor performed\nand estimated that this work with the post took at least six days per year in total.7 A further\nrequirement was that pastors announce the contents of many of these patents from the pulpit\non Sunday, following the end of divine service. Sometimes it was demanded that the\nannouncement should be repeated on several Sundays or at other regular intervals. This was\nthe only mechanism for official information to reach peasants.\nThus the bureaucracy of the Russian Empire exploited the centuries-old system for\ndissemination of religious information maintained by the Lutheran Church. For a long time,\nbefore the existence of newspapers, the pastors informed their congregations about births and\ndeaths, read banns, and also notified them about public corporal punishments of peasants\nand dealt with other local matters. When the official information system incorporated\nchurches, the pastor served as a hub or a router for the distribution of the most important\nnews of the Empire and the province.\nAnother task of the pastors essential for the supply of information to peasants was the\nimprovement of the peasants’ literacy. Although a few schools for the peasants existed in the\neighteenth century, the primary teaching method was home schooling supervised by pastors.\nIt had some success: in 1790 61 per cent of young people in the province were literate,8\nmeaning they could at least read, but to learn writing at home was technologically more\ncomplicated and required the use of goose feathers or slate pencils. At the end of the\neighteenth century, the printing of books in local languages started to develop; even some\nsecular books were printed, and hymnals and Bibles found a place on farms. Nevertheless, the\nrole of books in information distribution, except for religious texts, was negligible.\nWhen the official German and Russian newspaper of the Livland province, Лифляндские\nгубернские ведомости or Livländische Gouvernements-Zeitung, was first distributed on 1\nNovember 1852 (dates are represented according to the Julian calendar throughout this\npaper), it announced with the publication of issue no. 5 of 15 November 1852 that a new\nsystem for the dissemination of patents would be introduced. Several explanations of imperial\nlaws or in some cases full German translations were printed on leaflets that were sent to the\nlower state institutions and parishes together with the newspaper. The pastors were obliged to\nfollow the previous rules: to circulate these leaflets in the parishes and to read them from the\npulpit.\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 119\n', 'The retention and destruction of records\nAfter being circulated, all the patents, together with other church correspondence and\ndocumentation, were gathered in the parish archives, except for those that had to be sent back\nto the issuing office with the collected signatures of manor representatives. The documents\nwere stored for some 150 years in these archives, until the archives were liquidated. The\nmetrical books of parish records went to the state archives, but the fate of other information\nwas less fortunate.\nAccording to some unconfirmed sources, the Lutheran Church of Soviet Latvia decided in\nthe 1970s that maintaining the archives was an unnecessary burden. However, the state\narchives found that they had no space in their premises for such a vast amount of documents;\nthey also decided that the materials of the parish archives had no historical value. The fate of\nthe parish archives in Soviet Estonia, including those that once belonged to the Livland\nprovince, was different: many more church documents were deposited in the state archives.\nIn Latvia, the complete parish archives were moved to the paper mills and piled into the\nmountains of waste paper waiting for recycling there. So the ‘right to be forgotten’ triumphed,\nthough at that time nobody was discussing that particular right. Some employees of these\nenterprises and outsiders who managed to cross the fences dug into the mountains of paper\nand pocketed those documents that seemed most interesting to them. An urban legend relates\nthat a good part of the archive of Trikaten (now Trikāta) parish passed, not quite legally, into\nhands of a local history fan and was moved to his garage and the balcony of his flat. Whether\nor not this is true, many documents from various parish archives later emerged periodically\nin the market for old documents, and most of these came from the Trikaten parish archive.\nThe documents acquired in this market at the end of the 1990s were an initial and\nencouraging source of information for this investigation, and some are reproduced and\nreferenced here. A few of the documents have been published on the Internet by the author.9\nAt least two patents from the destroyed Trikaten parish archive found their way to the\nBayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich with the support of the Siemens Foundation.10\nThe vestiges of the church archives acquired in the document market include patents and\nother information sources that make it possible to judge what kind of information the parish\narchives once held, to try to evaluate their usefulness for historical research, and to decide\nwhether the erasing of this information preserved for such a long time was an act of\nvandalism.\nAt first glance, it seems that the copies of the patents in the parish archives had no value\nbecause they duplicated the texts in the files of the Livland provincial government in the\nLatvian State Historical Archive.11 If a patent contained a German translation of an imperial\nAct, the appropriate translation could also be found in the corresponding archives of the\nprovincial governments of Courland and Estland, as each province translated the patents\nindependently. At times as many as three variants of these translations might be available in\narchives. The originals of the translated acts, mainly issued by the governing Senate, are held\nin the Russian archives and are fully available on the Internet.12 In this paper, these acts are\nreferenced only by their dates because it is easy to find the full text in the websites cited.\nA tiny but essential difference between the patent copies in the archive of the provincial\ngovernments and those from the former parish archives lies in the notes on the parish copies\nthat were made in the manors and signed by responsible persons. The meaning of these notes\nwas simple and always the same: they merely designate that the patent was read. An example\n120 B. MARTUZĀNS\n', 'of a set of such notes can be found on the Internet.13 However, the signatures of the manor\nmanagers are diverse and doubtless have some historical value.\nOn 10 September 1809 the note shown in Figure 1 was written on a patent at\nAlt-Wrangelshof (in Latvian, Vecbrenguļi) manor. It is interesting that this note was written\nin Latvian. As usual, it verified that the document was read and sent on for further review or,\nas the note informed: ‘seen in Vecbrenguļi manor, goes to the Pastorate’. The note was signed\nby stahrast Saulit. Stahrast (the preferred spelling would now be ‘starast’) designates a\nposition: the senior of the manor serfs, who supervised the work of other serfs. Saulit was the\nname of the farm, as the starast, like other serfs, had no family name yet. The revision lists\n(the analogues of taxpayer lists) for that date confirm that the starast of Alt-Wrangelshof\nmanor was the sixty-three-year-old Mikkel, head of the Saulit farm.14\nLater, on 26 February 1815, a text with the same information (Figure 2) was written on a\nsimilar document, but it was signed by J. Saulit and written in German. According to the\nsame revision lists, the author was Mikkel’s son Jahn and had the position of overseer,\nAufseher, in the manor (he was twenty-four years old in 1815).\nJahn was surprisingly highly educated for a peasant. He wrote in German using two ‘fonts’\nin full accordance with the rules of that time: Gothic Fraktur for the German words and\nAntiqua for the place names, including Alt-Wrangelshof, Trikaten, and Pastorath, as well for\nhis own name, though with a small error: Pastorath was incorrectly written as ‘Passtorath’. He\nalso had mastered the technique of preparing writing pens from goose feathers: compared\nFigure 1. Starast Saulit signed a patent in Latvian in 1809.\nFigure 2. J. Saulit signed a note on a patent in German in 1815.\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 121\n', 'with those of his father’s writing, the lines are observably more elegant and better drawn, and\nthe hand is steadier, showing a very experienced writer. A question arises: where could a\nperson from a family of serfs acquire the education and experience to learn to write in\nGerman? The parish schools available to serfs did not teach German at all.\nThe study of patent signatures shows that serfs could be made responsible for the reading\nof essential papers in German even before liberation, as Mikkel was not the only starast who\nsigned patents.15 There even were starasts who could write the appropriate text in German. It\nis clear that a starast was obliged to have some knowledge of German; otherwise he could not\nunderstand the instructions of the manor holder, but it was probably too difficult for the\nstarasts to fully comprehend the patents of provincial government.\nThese signatures increase our knowledge about the starasts and their duties, in contrast to\nthe folklore and memories that depict them as the ‘myrmidons’ of the oppressor, though that\nwas also the case. After all, they had the authority to punish other serfs corporally, which\nmight increase their productivity, but certainly not their love. The manor archives may have\ncontained more information about starasts and their activities, but frequently these archives\ndisappeared long before the parish archives.\nIt should be added, however, that when the Latvian nation started to develop shortly after\nthis period, people sought to acquire the essentials of European culture, and the most effective\nway to do so was to connect to the German information world. Thus, the serfs and their sons\nwho succeeded in learning German worked towards the future. Of course, some of them were\nGermanised later, but the family of the starast Mikkel was not such a case. It is known that a\ngrandson of his granddaughter was Jānis Endzelı̄ns (1873–1961), the most prominent Latvian\nlinguist and to date the highest authority in correct Latvian.16\nAnother group of documents in the parish archives consisted of the instructions and\norders of the Evangelical Lutheran Consistory in Livland. These orders were distributed as\nprinted copies, and they dealt with the internal problems of the Church. These copies are\nnormally identical to the documents in the existing consistory archive.17\nThe parish archives also hold the decisions and orders of various state institutions as well\nas their letters, which usually were also read from the pulpit and circulated around the\nmanors. The order courts or Ordnungsgericht that operated in each district of the province,\nand also had some police functions, were significantly more active than other courts.\nThe courts released orders in the name of the Tsar, except in local matters like the loss or\ntheft of property, fugitive serfs or wanted criminals, public sales, and similar news. The\nofficials wrote documents by hand, and if several parishes were to be notified, the appropriate\nnumber of copies was produced. These documents each had a registration number, meaning\nthat they were registered in the office books.\nA letter of the Ordnungsgericht court of the Walk district (May 1816) is shown in Figure 3\nas an example of the information that can be gleaned from a quite ordinary document. This\ndocument is missing in the state archives because the Latvian State History Archive holds the\ndocuments of this court only for 1820–85.18\nThe letter was addressed to all manors of Trikaten parish and informed them that a\nhorse belonging to the 7th Pioneer Company had run away from Sackenhof manor (Latvian:\nVāles Muiža). It was a gelding, five years old, with a red and brown coat, and marked on\nthe left side; it was 1 arschin 15 vershoks (138cm) tall, and had a collar on its neck. The\nletter asked anybody who by chance had caught the runaway to bring it to the company’s\npremises in Ronneburg (now Rauna). The incident took on 11 May, and the letter was sent\n122 B. MARTUZĀNS\n', 'on 27 May and reached the first manor on 1 June, so the horse could have been running loose\nfor a rather long time, which unfortunately would have been a bit cumbersome with a collar\non its neck.\nThough this particular incident with the horse is absolutely not essential for the history of\nthe whole Russian Empire, some historical information can be revealed or confirmed by the\ndocument:\n• The 7th Pioneer Company was stationed in Ronneburg in May 1816.\n• The horses in the Russian Army were marked on their sides like modern combat vehicles.\n• The Germans in Livland used the Russian word хомут for collar, ‘Chomutt’, not the\nsimilar-sounding German word Kummet, which supports the definition included in\nFigure 3. A letter about a runaway horse.\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 123\n', 'August Wilhelm Hupel’s dictionary.19 No doubt, the texts of courts letters might also\nserve as an information source for studies of German ‘bureauspeak’ used in Livland if\nanybody were ever interested in such research.\n• The Ordnungsgericht courts were charged with searching for lost army horses, and the\npastors and manors were involved in this process.\n• The horses for pioneers were small. One arschin corresponds to 71 cm and was equal to\n16 vershoks, so the height of the lost horse was about 138cm. This was actually the\nminimum height for army horses.\nThe Empire had a shortage of army barracks; therefore many units were quartered in private\napartments, which may explain the stationing of the pioneer company in Ronneburg. It\nremains unknown why some company members went to Sackenhof, about 25km from\nRonneburg. It seems that they were not very kind to the horse, which had to run away wearing\nits collar, evidently precisely during the harnessing process.\nWhen messages sent through the post became more common, Lutheran pastors exchanged\nletters that discussed professional matters. For example, they sent letters to the provost\nconcerning internal problems of the Church, such as preparing a hymnal or solving financial\nissues. These letters were usually numbered and were subsequently registered in some church\nregisters that had evidently been kept in destroyed parish archives. The provost would add\nthis correspondence to the archive of his church.\nThe pastors sometimes used the parish network to provide their own information to the\nmanors of the parish. For example, at the end of the eighteenth century, the pastor of Trikaten\nparish, Johann Balthasar Salzmann, sent around a recipe and preparation instructions for an\nexcellent inexpensive liniment to ward off the horse plague.20 He had received the recipe from\na friend in Wolmar (now Valmiera).\nThe mobility of the peasants increased from the 1830s, and this necessitated more intensive\nexchange of information among the pastors. If a Lutheran believer moved from one parish\nto another, they had to obtain a parish certificate called a Parochial Schein from the\nprevious parish for themselves or for the entire family. This certificate was an excerpt from\nthe parish records with personal information: estate (profession), birth date and place,\nparents, confirmation, marital status, and previous communion date. It was presented to the\npastor of the new parish, recorded in the register of members, and stored in the parish\narchive. The pastors also sent out information about the declarations of future marriages,\nwhether the couples belonged to different parishes, and other information. Almost always,\nthese documents were numbered and registered. This information is important for local\nand especially for family histories.\nPretty intensive correspondence was also taking place within the courts of the civil\nparishes (counties). These courts were introduced in the 1820s, following liberation,\nand were meant, for example, to inform the pastor that a widow or a widower had\nsolved all possible property problems with their children and other legal heirs, so that the\ncourt would not object to the subsequent marriage. Letters announcing court decisions\nconcerning a pastor’s demand for investigation of the sinful behaviour of parish members\nor about the paternity of a child born out of wedlock were not unusual. A dozen such\nexamples are available on the Internet.21 The archives of many courts of civil parishes\nare preserved in the state archives, but not all of them and not the full extent of those that\ndo survive.\n124 B. MARTUZĀNS\n', 'Some letters were also sent to the pastors by parish members. An example is a letter from\nJahn Egliht of Adsel (now Gaujiena) to the provost, with a complaint about the illegal\ndecision of the local pastor Ludwig Heerwagen, who had prohibited his marriage to a\ncousin.22\nThe pastors regularly had to write numerous reports for the consistory about the\ndemographic and economic situation.23 The pastor of Trikaten parish, Johann Eduard Pohrt,\ncirculated copies of these reports to disseminate information to all manors and deposited\nthem in the parish archive. His book of home visits in the 1820s, in several volumes,\ncontained detailed lists of the people at each farm and showed yearly farmhand migrations\nfrom farm to farm. The book was sold to a private collector, so it cannot be found in the\narchives. Additional information about documents in parish archives can be found on the\nInternet.24\nIt can be concluded that the destruction of church archives severely impacted the\ninformation sources for microhistory – the histories of particular churches, local and family\nhistories, and social history. However, this is not all. The annihilated documents would have\ncontributed to future historical studies when the methods of artificial intelligence, deep\nlearning, big data processing, and so on are adapted for the research of historical documents,\ntaking advantage of the experience of many intelligence services that employ such methods\nnow for processing captured emails and records in social networks. To achieve this goal, all\npossible archival documents, old books, and other printed materials need to be fully digitised,\nand the resulting databases made available to researchers with computers. It will be tough and\ntime-consuming work, and unfortunately will be done without information from Latvian\nchurch archives.\nThe infrastructure of the information network, its maintenance, and threats\nThe infrastructural backbone of the information distribution network was the post roads\nwith the post stations, their personnel, and horses. The main road in Livland was the St\nPetersburg–Riga road, which by the seventeenth century reached as far as Narva city, but the\nfinal leg to St Petersburg was fully completed only at the end of the eighteenth century.\nThe provincial nobility were responsible for the maintenance of the roads in the province.\nA section of the post road was allocated to each manor for maintenance. The length of the\nsection was set according to the number of ploughs held by the manor, and this was marked\non the road by special poles.25 Theoretically, these parts of the road had to be allocated near\nthe respective manors, but it is easy to see that it was not always possible.\nThe repair of the post roads was obligatory twice a year, in autumn and spring, as well\nwhen severe defects were discovered. The supply of all necessary materials for the repair of the\nroad, bricks, and verst (1.07km) poles was the responsibility of the manors, and the provincial\ngovernment regularly inspected the roads’ condition.\nFor example, on 1 June 1817 the Ordnungsgericht court in Walk commanded the manors\nof Trikaten parish to repair their parts of the post road promptly, as the road was in a terrible\ncondition due to heavy rains.26 The ruts and holes were to be filled with gravel, and the bricks\ncovered with soil or sand to make them even enough for a cart to cross them without any\nbumps. The order had to be circulated around the manors very quickly because a road\ninspection by the province authorities was planned on 7 June.\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 125\n', 'The manors were obliged to maintain the parish-wide road network. The church officer or\nKirchenvorsteher supervised this work and could punish the manors for negligence; he could\nalso be punished himself if the roads were in a bad condition.27 The provincial government\nincluded in the parish network roads to separate farms in order for the pastor to reach\ncritically ill persons in any weather conditions.\nThe local nobility in Livland were also responsible for building and running of the post\nstations along the routes. They had to follow the regulations from St Petersburg concerning\nthe post station infrastructure but this was not always possible. The Tsarina’s act of 22 March\n1770 concerning the reconstruction of six post stations on the St Peterburg–Narva route,\nwhich was a part of the St Peterburg–Riga route, offers some insights into the regulations of a\nstandard post station infrastructure.\nThis act stated that each of these post stations should have twenty-five good horses fit for\npost transport and worth not less (yes, not less) than 20 roubles each. Ten men fit for the\nwork of the postman, not teenagers, were to be hired to work with these horses. Each post\nstation had to be equipped with ten kibitkas — four-wheeled vehicles with bonnets. The\nkibitkas should have iron rims on wheels as well as iron kingbolts. The passengers in a kibitka\nusually travelled lying down owing to the lack of seats.28 For wintertime, the stations had to\nhave ten sledges with bonnets. Of course, the stations had to have all the parts of the necessary\nharnesses for the horses and additionally six good saddles.\nThe establishment of a post station also assumed the building of houses with living\nspace for the station master (post commissar), all postmen, and other staff. It required a\nlocation for travellers to spend the night. Using open fires for cooking and heating, and\ncandles or tapers for lighting, and preserving live coals for the ignition, all created serious\nfire risks for the wooden buildings, which contained a lot of combustible materials.\nConsequently, the post stations began to be constructed from stone at the end of the\neighteenth century.\nA critical part of the post infrastructure was the horses. All twenty-five or more horses\nneeded stalls. Additionally, a shed for hay and straw was necessary, as well as a coach shed for\nall kinds of vehicles, harnesses, and saddles. Of course, a regular supply of water was essential,\nincluding a good well and a suitable pond or nearby river to water the horses.\nIn the beginning, the manors, depending on their plough numbers, were obliged to send\nthe necessary horses and men to the post stations. C. H. Nielsen mentioned in his legal\nmanual for the Livland and Estland nobility, printed in 1794, that this practice had ended and\nthe manors should provide horses only in exceptional cases, such as the transport of\nhigh-born persons, road inspectors, arrested persons, and others.29 Sometimes this practice\nwas a real burden to the manors. When in February 1825 the future Tsar Nicholas I, then an\nordinary Grand Prince, travelled to Riga with his wife, Trikaten parish received an order to\nsupply eighty-six horses for five days for the journey. In 1802 Tsar Alexander I visited Riga,\nand a contemporary brochure described the people’s willingness to meet their beloved father,\nand the humility of the monarch, who together with his entourage required only seventy\nhorses.30\nApparently, the main threat to post station buildings was fire, but robbers also threatened\nthe staff and the horses, and perhaps the most significant threat for the station functioning\nwas from travellers— the users of the system. On 11 July 1732, Her Majesty Anna Ioannovna\nissued an act stating that some travellers had been rude to and misbehaved with post\npersonnel in Estland and Livland, and had even taken horses by force without payment,\n126 B. MARTUZĀNS\n', 'and she ordered an end to this practice. The post station officials in Estland and Livland\nobtained the authority to detain any rude persons and to deliver them to the governor\nor another state institution, where they would be punished corporally or with the death\npenalty.\nEven this order did not guarantee normal behaviour from the travellers. Three years later\nthe Senate announced in an act of 21 October 1735 that the horses in the post stations of\nEstland province were very weak and unfit for further use because of overwork. It was also\nfound that some travellers were still behaving aggressively with the personnel, racing the\nhorses too fast, and even stabbing them with their rapiers. Therefore two soldiers were sent to\njoin each post station in Estland, as was already general practice in Livland. These soldiers\nstayed in the stations; they did not follow the post carriages but defended the post personnel\nfrom travellers who requested various unlawful privileges.\nSimilar orders were also issued later, but it seems that the problems with horses existed\nuntil the horse post ended. Not only travellers could be blamed for cruelty to horses.\nSometimes a postman who had reached a station stayed for too long in the inn nearby, and\nthen tried to rush back to the home station on time, beating the horses mercilessly.\nThe activities of post robbers depended on both the particular period of time and the\nregion and became more intensive towards the end of the eighteenth century, when sending\nmoney by post became more frequent. It seems that robberies did not occur on a massive\nscale— at least Johann Christoph Petri, who worked as a home tutor in Livland and Estland\nfrom 1784 to 1796, asserted that the level of safety on the roads of Baltic provinces was very\nhigh.31 The situation would be worse after the French–Russian war of 1812, when deserters,\nrunaway recruits, and strolling soldiers of both armies appeared.\nLatency and speed of information delivery\nThe latency and speed of information distribution and dissemination in the network\ndepended on both the post system and the activities in the parishes. The 25 November 1818\npatent of the provincial government repeated the regulations for patent distribution and\ncriticised those pastors who delayed circulation of the patents for weeks or failed to inform all\nmanors.\nAnother limitation was the speed of the post horses. On 23 December 1793 the Livland\nprovincial government set that the maximum speed of a kibitka with a postman and two\ntravellers, harnessed with two horses, had to be 10 versts per hour in good road conditions.\nThis was the maximum permitted speed for travellers.32 The postmen who delivered the post\nwere allowed a speed of 12 versts per hour on a good road.\nThe real speed of travel could be different. J. C. Petri asserted that there was hardly any\nother country where transport was faster than in Livland and Estland, writing that a journey\nfrom Riga to St Petersburg (547 versts) in wintertime, if the conditions were good, could take\nonly forty-eight hours.33 Taking into account that changing horses could officially take fifteen\nminutes, and needed to be done twenty-seven times on this route, it thus follows that the\naverage speed was at least 13 versts per hour in this case, but the maximum speed was higher,\nof course.\nA document describing events that took place at the end of 1825 presents an example of\ninformation distribution at the maximum speed in the whole Empire, and of the exceptional\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 127\n', 'situation inside Trikaten parish.34 It was a letter that the Ordnungsgericht court in Walk sent\nto all manors of Trikaten parish. Before that some highly important events took place in the\nEmpire.\nTsar Alexander I died in Taganrog (a city on the shore of the Azov Sea) on 19 November\n1825, and the news of his death reached the capital on 27 November. The distance between\nthe two cities according to present sources is estimated as 1,900km, so the information speed\nmay have been about 11 versts per hour. According to the published rules, the heir to the\nthrone was his brother Grand Duke Constantin, who at that time lived in Warsaw and\nreceived the news of his father’s death on 25 November. He did not want to rule and had\npreviously transferred his right to another brother, Grand Duke Nicholas. The governing\nSenate, which was not informed about this decision within the Tsar’s family, announced to all\ncitizens on 27 November that Tsar Alexander I had died and that all male citizens except serfs\nshould take an oath of allegiance to Constantin. An exchange of letters between Constantin\nand Nicholas started and took some time. During this interregnum period, people were\nunaware of the identity of the actual Tsar. These significant events are described in all Russia\nhistory textbooks, following the leading sourcebook of M. Korff.35\nOn 9 December 1825 the Landrats Collegium, the elected council of Livland nobility that\ncould also issue some orders, sent a letter to the Ordnungsgericht courts along the Riga–St\nPetersburg route. The Collegium ordered the Ordnungsgericht court in Walk to deliver\nsixty-five horses to each of the post stations (Stackeln and Gulben) in the Walk district in the\nearly morning of 13 December for the expected journey of both His Majesty Constantin and\nthe fourth brother, Grand Duke Mikhail, who presumably could go from St Petersburg to\nmeet Constantin half-way. Obviously, everybody in Riga was sure that in a few days\nConstantin would go to St Petersburg to begin his rule as Tsar.\nAs a result the Ordnungsgericht court in Walk sent the above-mentioned letter on 11\nDecember to all the manors of Trikaten parish with details of the horses and men that had to\narrive at the prescribed post station on the morning of 13 December. The men had to be\nsober, well-trained, and decently dressed, and the men and horses had to be furnished with\nenough provisions to last eight days. If during these eight days the Tsar had not yet left and no\nadditional orders were issued, these horses and men were to be changed to the next group.\nThe first of the manors received the letter on 12 December at 4 p.m.; the next six manors\nwere not informed until 12 p.m. on the same day, following a process which at other times\ncould take about a week. The other two manors discovered at 4 a.m. on 13 December that\nthey must send the horses and men that were demanded immediately, without any\npreparation or hope of reaching the post stations in time.\nThese abnormal efforts were nonsensical, because on 12 December Nicholas issued a\nmanifesto stating that he had begun to rule as Tsar. All citizens now took an oath of allegiance\nto Nicholas I; Constantin did not travel to St Petersburg.\nInformation safety and security\nThe physical security of the information delivered by official patents or private letters\nprobably was not threatened seriously by robbers, because they merely opened the postbags\nand fished out money; the letters held no interest for them. The postmen were a more\nsignificant risk factor. On 17 October 1771, the Senate found that the postal service had lost\n128 B. MARTUZĀNS\n', 'some higher-level orders and that as a result these orders had not been executed, so it directed\nthe post officials to always inform it about the occasional losses of post. Rather cleverly, this\nact did not set a punishment for the loss of mail or for failure to report losses, which gave\nhope that information about lost post would not be hidden.\nInformation about losses was also distributed later. On 20 December 1809 the provincial\ngovernment circulated a patent with information about a lost sack containing 120,000 roubles\nin bank assignations, which corresponds to 1.25 tons (yes, tons) of silver coins. Presumably,\nit was lost some versts from the Gulben post station in Walk district. The provincial\ngovernment offered 10,000 roubles to the finder, but the court banker A. F. Rall in St\nPetersburg, the sender of the money, distributed the appropriate information in Russian,\nGerman, Latvian, and for obscure reasons also in French with the promise of 20,000 roubles\nand with the guarantee that the name of the person who found the sum would not be\ndisclosed.\nThere was another clear risk of disruption of official information. It was not easy\nto translate the orders into German without mistakes. Laur discovered errors in the\ntranslations,36 and the translators themselves distributed corrections to previous translations.\nIn the eighteenth century, only about ten patents also included the Latvian translation of the\norders;37 in most cases, the Livland pastors in parishes translated the German texts that\nthey received into Latvian or Estonian in order to announce them from the pulpit. The\npastors, who were ethnic Germans, were examined in their knowledge of a local language\nbefore ordination; however, there were also pastors with limited command of the local\nlanguage, so some inaccuracies could occur after two translations.\nThe risk of information being leaked from the official letters does not seem to have been\nhigh— hardly anybody wished to ‘hack’ these letters in order to become informed about the\norders a few days before other people. Possibly the only exception was information about\nrecruiting, which in Livland started in 1793. It was forbidden to reveal the date on which the\nrecruits were taken, to prevent the hiding of young men. A fine of 50 roubles protected the\nsecrecy of this information according to the patent of 1802 concerning recruitment.38 At that\ntime, it was possible to buy a serf for this amount of money (not the best one, however).\nThe rather worn-out appearance of this real patent of 1802 concerning recruitment from\nthe former Trikaten parish archive invites a suspicion that it was distributed there unsealed,\ncontrary to the demand printed on it. The general instructions for the distribution process of\nthe patents and the use of a locked bag to which each manor had keys were also probably not\nobeyed. In later years sealed patents concerning recruitment were addressed directly to each\nmanor, and circulation around manors was not needed.\nThe hacking of information was a greater threat for private letters. The history of\nperlustration (the precursor of modern hacking) in Russia is thoroughly researched in the\nrecent monograph of V. S. Izmozik.39 Perlustration at government level was organised as a\nsystem (the ‘black rooms’) around 1742, and initially its primary goal was to read and copy\nthe correspondence of foreign diplomats, but later this information collection method was\nextended. For example, Catherine II ordered the perlustration of the mail of more than twenty\nhighly positioned Baltic German nobles. Izmozik describes the problems of engraving\nthe fake seals of the diplomats, cracking cyphers, and developing a technique for opening the\nwax-sealed letters without detection. This activity was kept secret, and no orders concerning\nperlustration were made public, for otherwise, as was mentioned in secret orders, the\ngovernment would lose a valuable information source.\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 129\n', 'The hiding of perlustration, however, was not successful. Petri described his impressions in\nhis book and speculated about perlustration by stating that the cracking open of letters in Riga\nexisted but was greatly exaggerated at the time when the book was written.40 Possibly Petri\nhad discussed this problem with people who were exaggerating its extent. In any case, he\nrecommended care in writing letters in Livland, as in other countries.\nPetri also wrote that during the reign of Catherine II (1762–96) the cracking and opening\nof letters was nothing extraordinary. He himself had at that time received some cracked letters\nthat did not even show attempts to hide the fact. Petri doubted, however, that the letters were\nperlustrated in accordance with a secret order of the government; he rather supposed that it\nwas the initiative of local post officers. Maybe he was right, because his correspondence was of\nhardly any interest to the Empress, and the state perlustrators worked more diligently. The\npost officers were not allowed to crack any letters, but they had good reasons to study\ncorrespondence in the hope of gaining additional income because, according to the laws, an\ninformant who reported illegal business activities or violation of customs regulations was well\npaid.\nThe writing of bogus letters with misleading sender names or addresses (spoofing) was\nrather complicated at that time because such a letter had to replicate the handwriting,\nsignature, and seal of the impersonated sender. Nevertheless, it took place. In Livland a\nJohanna Ostermann, who claimed to be a countess and a challenger to the Swedish crown,\nwas tried in 1817.41 To prove these claims, she had presented fake letters from several highly\npositioned persons.\nFake news and content regulation\nAlthough the well-organised official distribution system of news was meant to be without\ncompetitors, there existed an unofficial information channel: rumours. The churches again\nhad an important indirect role in rumour spreading, as the regular divine services in Sundays\ngathered people from all or almost all of the parish farms, which allowed for the wide\ntransmission of information by word of mouth in the existing social networks of persons in\neach community. The same was true for the inns near the churches. Similarly, work in a\nmanor gathered groups of people from different farms, and people came together to celebrate\nfolk or family festivities, etc. All these events were suitable for information exchange.\nIn 1783 there was unrest over the head tax in Livland (see, for example, the book of A. von\nTransehe-Roseneck).42 It was caused by an order of the Senate to apply imperial head tax laws\nto Livland. Some peasants, when they learned that they had to pay a new tax to the Crown,\nconcluded that this would give them the status of Crown-owned peasants, which seemed\npreferable. Their next conclusion was that they should no longer work for the private manors,\nand some refused to continue this practice outright. This kind of strike was not acceptable,\nand the provincial government issued several patents explaining that the new head tax\nchanged nothing in the relations between peasants and manors. It did not help. The unrest\nwas suppressed only by the army, resulting in many civilian casualties. After that, a patent in\nLatvian and Estonian that blamed peasants for the unrest was issued on 21 July 1784.\nIn this patent, the cause of the unrest was found to be the ‘flummery’ (dissemination of fake\nnews) of some ‘scoundrels’ (trolls), which stupefied the peasants. Merkel supported this idea\nin his book and revealed the identity of one such ‘scoundrel’.43 He asserted that a pastor had\n130 B. MARTUZĀNS\n', 'not explained the law adequately from the pulpit and had maybe even intentionally let the\npeasants suppose that now they belonged to the Crown. Merkel, as authors of that time\nusually did, observed privacy and did not mention the name of the pastor; however, in the\nnext sentence, he declared that the Latvian deputies of Ronneburg parish had immediately\nroamed the land. It can be concluded that the unnamed pastor was Wilhelm Michael Wurm,\nthe pastor of Ronneburg parish.44\nThe role of the instigators from Ronneburg in the peasant unrest seems to have been\nexaggerated. It is more likely that the information was disseminated by the common\nmechanism of rumour spreading, which was greatly intensified by a longing to believe that\nthis news was true, so the serfs shared their dreams and hopes in the form of fake news.\nAt the imperial level, laws attempting to regulate the content of rumours were issued\nregularly. A legal code for security and order, printed in 1836, confirmed the prohibition\nagainst the dissemination of harmful rumours and referenced twenty-four previous decrees\nof the tsars, concerning the content of rumours over the last hundred years.45\nA decision of the Senate published for general circulation on 31 January 1776 was not\namong these twenty-four decrees. It was related to the case of I. Fedoseyev, a sub-lieutenant,\nwho told others that landlord-owned peasants would be turned into Crown-owned peasants,\ni.e. he distributed the same fake news that the Livland peasants did some years later. The\nSenate announced that according to the laws he could be executed, but instead he was only\nstripped of his military rank and knighthood, and then, as he was no longer a nobleman and\ncould be punished corporally, he was beaten with a knout and sent to hard labour.\nThe control of the content of printed information sources was not forgotten, and\ncensorship existed in Russia for a long time, though Catherine II established a system of\ncensorship institutions only in 1796.46 Her decree of 16 September liquidated private\ntypographies, created censorship institutions and professional censors, and prohibited the\nprinting of uncensored books. The censors in Riga received the task of controlling all\nimported books. The German authors in Livland could escape these limitations by printing\ntheir works in a German state, as did Merkel, who published his above-mentioned book\ncriticising serfdom in Leipzig (Saxony). Then, however, the problem of how to smuggle the\nbooks into Livland appeared.\nCensorship of private letters, which, unlike perlustration, was openly announced, was also\npractised. A. N. Vigilev states that in 1700 the open censorship of letters to foreign countries\nwas introduced to avoid the leaking of military secrets.47 All such letters had to be presented\nin the post offices unsealed for censoring. It is rather difficult to prove that this was the first\nworldwide occurrence of the open censorship of letters, as Vigilev declared, but it is quite\nclear that this was not the last time in the Russian Empire. Such military censorship also took\nplace later when hostilities were planned or opened, although the first official military censor\nwas named in 1810.\nThe perlustration or censoring of letters had little importance for the peasants, simply\nbecause they wrote practically no letters, except when they complained to state institutions,\nwhich was not always allowed. The regulations concerning the spreading of political rumours\napplied to the peasants also, of course. At the same time, some non-political rumours\nspreading among the peasants were also fought. The publicity activities promoting smallpox\nvaccination in Livland can be considered an example of this.\nBetween 1805 and 1820 the provincial government of Livland issued ten patents\nconcerning vaccination. The first was a letter that the civil-governor, Christoph Adam von\nBEFORE NEWSPAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH 131\n', 'Richter, sent to all pastors of Livland on 29 September 1805, in which he appealed to them\n(not ordered, as was more typical) to explain, from the pulpit and in personal\ncommunications, the need for and safety of vaccination.48 He also recommended avoiding\nthe word ‘cow-pox’ (Kuhpocken) and preferred ‘protective pox’ (Schutzblatter), because some\npeasants might misunderstand the reference to cows owing to their (the peasants’, not the\ncows’) limited comprehension. Evidently, the peasants were suspicious of the treatment with\nsomething that came from cows and distributed rumours (fake information), just like the\nopponents of vaccination in England at that time who expected horns to grow on vaccinated\npeople.\nSome pastors truly participated in the promotion of vaccination. In May 1803 Dr Otto von\nHuhn invited the pastors to learn how to vaccinate and sent each of them printed instructions\nfor vaccination, fresh lymph, and a needle, and, as a newspaper stated, the action was not\nwithout success.49\nAlthough smallpox is defeated today, limited comprehension, about which von Richter\nwrote, is not: some people still warn about the dangers of vaccination. There are other\ntwo-hundred-year-old problems like information security and fake information that need to\nbe be solved and hopefully will be solved; and other problems like content regulation that\nhopefully never will be.\nNote on contributor\nBruno Martuzāns, Dr. math., worked at the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science\nof the University of Latvia from its establishment in 1961. He was engaged in the\nmathematical simulation of technological processes and numerical mathematics. He also\nparticipated in programming education and the promotion of the Internet. Currently, his\nresearch and educational activities are concerned with the history of cyber criminality and\nissues of the domain names industry.\nNotes\nAll Internet sites were accessed on 3 October 2019.\n1.
