VOL. 32 NO. 47\nPANHANDLE Bilfi\n. VlGiOHIUDS.\nAt a big mass meeting he id Tues\nday night iii the Firemen\'s iJ;ill a\nlarge number of citizens of Berkelev\nconnty said they wanted annual fairs\nheld at Auburndale. The meeting:\nproved a far gi\\ atnr success than\nwas anticipated, the hall being well\nfilled with men from nearly every\nwalk in life, and the interest they\nmanifested plainly showed that they\nare determined to give the city and\ncounty the widest possible advertis\ning obtainable- through the medium\nof amnial fairs.\nMr. Martin Chairman.\nThe meeting was called to order\nby Alex Clohan, president of the spe\n\'* cial committee apj)ointed by the\nboard of trade to draft a scheme look\ning toward the organization of a fair\nassociation. Mr. Clohan briefly stat\ned the purpose of the meeting, and\ncalled Attorney Clarence E. Martin\nto the chair. Mr. Martin said the\npeople of Berkeley county are earn\nest in this movement, because they\nrealize the benefits to be derived\nfrom the holding of annual fairs, ;md\nthat it had for its object the instill\ning in the people the necessity for\nthe breeding and raising of better\nstock, the stimulating of interest\namong frr.it growers a!?;1, poiftrv rais\ners n.nd the bringing together of tlv j\n\' people in closer union.\nHe recalled the fact that ctlv-.v\ntowns no larger than Martinvburc\nhave fairs, which have caused them\nto be known throughout the country,\nand if Martinsburg desired to be\ncome better known the best way is\nto organize a fair association, and in\nthis way show to the country what\nthe Eastern Panhandle can produce.\nTie said, of eourse, it would re\'pr.rtf\nmoney, but lie believed a sufficient\nsum could be raised to finance the\nundertaking. He explained the plan\noutlined by the special committee ap\npointed by the board of trade. Mr.\nBush then read that report.\nThe Report.\nBriefly stated the report is: The\norganization is to be known as the\nEastern PanhandJe Fair association\nwith a capital stock of $50,000 to be\ndivided into 1,000 shares with a value\nof $50, and no person can own more\nthan 10 shares. Twenty per cent of\nthe stock is to be paid in cash, and\nthe remainder in 1, 2, 3 and 4 years,\nbut a reduction of 10 per cent will\nbe Riven if cash is paid.\nThe association proposes to p\\ir\n"\'??nse 40 acres of land from John W.\nStewart at Auburndale, for which he\nagrees to take $250 per acre or $10\n<100. which shall be paid ;\\s follows:\nTwo thousand dollars in cash and\nthe remainder in equal payments of\n1, 2, 3 and 4 years. The committee\nthought that an additional 4 acre;*\nshould be purchased and used for a\npublic park. Mr. Stewart asked\nJ2.000 for this tract upon the same\nterms.\nFollowing the reading of the report\nthe chairman stated if the plan were\nndonted a prominent local citizen\nwould beautify a portion of the\ngrounds for a public park, which\ncould be used by the people during\nthe evenings when they desired to\nlay aside business ci<\'f>s n on joy a\nlit\'lu rocrration. The chairman also\n\'?{?led if any citizen present desired\nto discuss the question he was ft lib\no.fy to do so because it was impor\ntant that it bo thoroughly understood.\nMr. Somers.\nTV. IT. Somers, of Berkeley Sprint\nresponded and said Morgan county\n?-itizens had often thought of organ\nising a fair association, but a,s the\ncounty is small, they were willing ;o\nJoin with the Berkeley county people\n. ..v? esutijlisii a fair here, where the\n,.t oducts of tiie Eastern Ranliaudle\n4utiiil he exhibited.\n?-otters Read.\noettors from Charles Alkirc, of\ngeyser; J. llainaioml Siler, of Berke\nley Springs, and Dr. James Wahnn\nMcSherry, were read, and they wer?\nmil of encouragement, every gentle\nman pledging his support should it\ndo de &.!!>. ed wise to undertaki- t.ho\nproject.\nMax Robinson then read a partial\nreport of the by-laws committee.\nMr. Dodd.\nCounty Assessor John \\\\".

Before the cat died or,\nrather, was killed, considerable excite\nment prevailed, and not a few of the\nresidents locked themselves in their\nhomes to escape the fury of the ani\nmal.\nThe trouble started when Stickel\'s\n"pet" escaped from its cage. The first\ntiling the animal did on getting free\nwas to quickly put to death two cats\nIn the neighborhood. The shrieks of\nthe tame cats as they were attacked\nby the wildcat struck terror in the\nhearts of the many women and chil\ndren and brought out the men of the\nneighborhood with guns and other\nweapons, and the hunt for the animal\nbegan.\nAfter some hours it was located un\nder the barn. Efforts were made to\ndrive it back to its cage without suc\ncess. Finally the unimai was shot by\nHorace Heynolds.\nRev. Dr. Trump, Secretary Miller\nand Twelve Young Men Meet\nthe Prisoners.\nYesterday afternoon at 4 o\'clock a\nband of twelve young men of St.\nJolin\'B Lutheran church led by their\npastor, Rev.

One prison\ncalled, for the "Titanic hymn"?\n"Xearer My, Clod to Thee"?in "which\nsong all joined heartily. Good results\nare expected from these services, es\npecially if words of encouragement\nare given the right hand grip when\ntbey are released from prison.\nIS FOUND NEARLY\nFROZEN 10 DEATH\nSON, RUSSELL, FOUND\nHIM SUNDAY MORNING\nWcll-Known Farmer Overcome With\nl-\'atigue Nearly Froz?n> to Death\nWhen Found On Ferrell\'s Ridge?\nCondition Slightly Improved, But\nVery Critical.\nMollis Dehaven, u w oil-known cit\nizen residing about four miles from\nJohnsontown, was found Sunday\nmorning at 7 o\'clock by Ills soil, Rus\nsell, in a frozen condition.

T!ie tune\nnow seems opportune to turn to thai\ngreat question, not only because the\ncurrency legislation, which absorbs!\n3our attention and tiie atteri;.i " ei\nthe country in December, is now dis\nposed ol, hut also because opm\nseems to he clearing ab<^ut us with\nsingular rapidity in this great fieirt\nof action.\nIn tiie- matter of the currency\ncleared suddenly and very happiiy\nafter the# much-debated act was pass\ned; in respect, of the monopolies\nwhich have multiplied about us an\']\nin regard to the various mean;;\nwhich they \'nave been organ i\'.-.-d an?\',\nmaintained it seems to bo com in v to\na clear and all but universal agree\nmcnt in anticipation of our action,\nas if by way of preparation, imkin\ntiie way easier to see and easier ;?\nset out npon with confidence and\nwithout contusion of counsel.\nTack Made Easier\nLegislation has its atme :>\']?m-<> "?\neverything rise, and the atmo.sphe"\naccommodation and nn;i::a! rarj-?\n.sanding which wo now breathe v;if)\n-o much refreshment is matter of r.\'1\ncere congratulation, it ought to make\nour task very much less difficult and\nembarrassing than it would have been\nhad we been obliged to continue to\nact a mid the atmosphere of suspicion\nand antagonism which has so long\nmade it impossible to approach such\nquestions with dispassionate fairness.\nConstructive legislation, when sue*\nccf;-iiil, is always the embodiment of\nconvincing experience, and of the ma\nture public opinion which finally\nsprings on) of that experience.\n"Legislation is a business of inter\npretation, not of origination; and it is\nnow plain what the opinion is to\nwhich we must give effect in thin\nmatter.

On the con\nirary. we desire the laws we are\n?b vA to pass to be the bulwarks!\n\'..id safeguards of industry against I\nforces that have disturbed it.\'\n.v hat we have to do can be done in I\n! new spirit, in thoughtful modera-l\ni u. without revolution of any unto-|\n.vard kind.\nWe are all agreed that "private\nMonopoly is indefensible and intoier\nible," and our program is founded\n:pen that conviction. It will be a\ncomprehensive but not a radical or\nunacceptable program, and these are\nitems \' ne -changes which opinion\nbdiberately sanctions and for which\neasiness waits.\nBar I nterlock i ng Directorates.\nIt waits with acquiescence, in the\nfirst place, for laws which will ef\nfectually prohibit and prevent such\nr.ierlocking of the personnel of the\ndirectorates of great corporations?\nbanivs and railroads, industrial, com\nmercial, and public service bodies?\nas in effect result in makVng those\nwho borrow and those who lend\npractically one and the sain*, those\nwho sell and those who buy but the\nsame persons trading with one an\nother under different names and in\ndifferent combinations, and those who\naffect to compete in fact partners\nand masters of some whole Held of\nbusiness. Suflk;ient time should be\nallowed, of course, in v.\'hich to effect\nthese changes of organization with\nout inconvenience or confusion.\nWill Dev^op New Men.\nSuch a prohibition will work much\nmore than a mere negative go">d by\ncorrecting the serious evllr, which\nhave prison, because, for example,\ni]>e men who have been the directing!\njpiriis of the great investment banks j\n? i!? ve usurped the place "Which belongs\nto independent \'Industrial manage\nment working in its own behoof.

Tt will immensely\nhearten the young men coming on i\nat d v ill greatly enrich the business\nactivities of the ncj1 country\nWider Control of Railways.\nIn the second place, business men\nas well as those who direct public\naffairs now recognize, and recognize\nwith painful clearness, the gireat.\nharm and injustice which lias been\ndone to many, if not all, of the great\nrailroad systems of the country by\nibe wav in which they haw been\nfinanced and their own distinctive in\nterests subordinated to the interests\n(if the men who financed them and\n.\nof other business enterprises which\nthose men wished to promote. The\nand accept with relief as well as ap\nproval, a law which, will coufer upon\nthe Interstate Commerce Commis\nsion the power to superintend and\ni t filiate the fiuauclal operations by\nwhich the railroads are henceforth\ncountry is ready, therefore, to accept\nto bo supplied with the money they\nneed for their proper development\nto meet the rapidly growing requiro\nm6nts of the country for Increased\nand improved facilities of transpor\ntation. We cannot postpone action\nIn this matter without leaving the\nra 1 roads exposed to many serious\nhandiU-aps and hazards; and the\nprosperity of the railroads and the\nprosperity of the country are Insep\narably connected.\n1\'pon this question those who are\nchiefly responsible for the actual\nmanagement and operation of the\nrailroads have spoken very plainly\nand very earnestly, with a purpose\nwe ought to be quick to accept. It\nwill be one step, and a very impor\ntant oYie, toward the necessary sep\naration of the husines of production\nfrom the business of transportation.\nAntitrust Law Definitions.\nThe business of the country awaits\nalso, has long awaited, and has suf\nfered because it could not obtain\nfurther and more explicit legislative\ndefinition of the policy and meaning\nof the existing antitrust law. Nothing\nhampers business like uncertainty.\nNothing daunts or discoiArages it\nlike the necessity to take chMiecs,\nto run the risk of falling under \\h?\ncondemnation of the law befo?v? it.\ncan make sure just what the law is.\nSurely we are sufficiently familiar\nwith the actual processes and meth\nods of monopoly and of the many\nhurtful restraints of trade to make\ndefinition possible, at any irate up to\nthe limits of what experience has\ndisclosed. These practices, being\nnow abundantly disclosed, can be ox\npllcifly and item by item forbidden\nby statute in such terms, as will\npractically eliminate uncertainty,\nthe law itself and the penalty being\nmade equally plain.\nTrade Commission Needed.\nAnd the. business men cf the coun\ntry desire something more than that\nthe menace of legal process in these\nmatters be made explicit and intelli\ngible. They desire the advice, the\ndefinite guidance, and Information\nwhich can be supplied by an admin\nistrative body, an interstate tirade\ncommission.\nSherman Law Resolution Should\nbe Defined and Individuals\nHeld Responsible for Acts.\nCurb on Private Fortunes\nDominating Varied Business\nes Suggested?Reparation for\nInjuries by Monopolies.\nThe opinion of the country wouli\ninstantly approve of Buch a coinmifr\nsion. Jt would not wish to see it\nempowered to make terme with mo\nnopoly or in any sort to assunrle con\ntrol of business, as if the govern\nment made itself responsible. It de\nmands such a commission only as an\nindispensable instrument of infor\nmation and publicity, as a clearing\nhouse for the facts by which both\nthe public mind and the managers\nof great business undertakings\nshould be guided, and as an instru\nmentality for doing justice to busi*\nness where the processes of the\ncourts or the natural forces of cor\nrection outside the courts tare In\nadequate to adjust the remedy to the\nwrong in a way that will meet all\nthe equities and circumstances of\nthe case.\nWould Administer Dissolutions.\nProducing industries, for example*\nwhich have passed the point up to\nwhich combination may be consist\nent with the public interest and the\nfreedom of trade, can not always be\ndissected into their component units\nas rapidly as railroad companies or\nsimilar organizations can be. Their\ndissolution by ordinary legal process\nmay oftentimes involve financial\nconsequences likely to overwhelm\n(he security market and bring upon\nit breakdown and confusion. There\nought to be an administrative com\nmission capable of directing and\nshaping such corrective processed,\nnot only In aid of the courts but\nalso by independent suggestion, if\nuecosswry- -- ..\nInasmuch as our object and \'the\nspirit of our action in these matters\nis to meet business half way in: Its ..\nprocesses of self-correction and dis- .\nturb its legitimate cojirse as little as\npossible, we ought to seo to it, and.\nthe judgment of practical and saga*\nclous men of affairs everywhere\nwould applaud us if we did see to it,\nthat penalties and punishments\nshould fall, not upon business itself,\nto its confusion and interruption,\nbut upon the individuals who use the\ninstrumentalities of business to do\nthings which public policy and\nsound business practice condemn.\nHold Individuals Responsible.\nEvery act. of business is done at\nthe command or upon the initiative\nof some ascertainable person or\ngroup of persons. These should be\nheld individually responsible and the\npunishment should fali upon them,\nnot upon the business organization\nof which they make illegal use. It\nshould l)t? one of the main .objects\n? ?\nof our legislation to divest such por\nsous of their corporate cloak and \'\ndeal with them as with those who\ndo not represent theiir corporation1*,\nbut merely by deliberate Intention\nbreak the law.\nBusiness men the country through\nwould, 1 am sure, applaud us if we\nwere to take effectual steps: to. dee :\nthat the officers and directors ? of\'\ngreat business bodies were prevent\ned from bringing them and the busi\nness of the country Into disrepute ?\nand danger.\nContiollinq Private Fortunes.\nOther questions remain which will\nneed very thoughtful and practical\ntreatment. Enterprises, In these\nmodern days of great individual fur\ntunes, are oftentimes interlocked,\nnot by being under the control of the\nsame directors but by the fact that\nthe greater part of their corporate\nstock is owned by a single person or\nwroup of persons who are in some\nway intimately related in interest. .\nWe are agreed, I take It, that hold\ning companies should be prohibited,\nbut what of the controlling private\nownership of individuals or (actually _\ncooperative groups of individuals?\nShall the private owners of capital\nstock be suffered to be themselves\nin effect holding companies?\nWo do not wish, I suppose, to for-?\nbid the purchase of stockB hey any\nperson who pleases t? buy them is\nsuch quantities as he can afford, .or\nin any way arbitrarily to limit the\nsale of stocks to bona fide purchas* \'\ners. Shall wo require the owners\nof stock, when their voting power\no} iqSno tpjuM. Boju-Bdinoo ituoaos u|\noe independent of one anotner would\nconstitute actual control, to make\nelection in which of them they will\nexercise their right tfi vote? This\nquestion I venture for your consid\neration.\nReparation For Injuries.\nThere is another matter in which\nimperative considerations of justice\nand fair play suggest thoughtful\nremedial action. Not only do m#ny\nof the combinations affected or\nsought to bo affected in the indus\ntrial world work an injustice upon\nthe public in general; they also di\nrectly and seriously injure the Indi\nviduals who are put out of biuKn*?ft\nin one unfair way or another by the\nmany dislodging t&nd exterminating\nforces of combination I hope that\nwe shall agree in giving private in\ndividuals who claim to have bM& In\njured by these processes the right to\nfound theijr suit? for redresa upon\nthe facts and judgments proved and\nentered in suits by the government\nwhere the government has upon lt?\nown initiative sued the combinations\ncomplained of and won Its suit, and\nthat the statute of limitations shall\nbe suffered to run against such liti\ngants only from the date pf the con\nclusion of the government\'s action.\nIt is not fair that the private liti\ngant should be obliged to set up and\nestablish again the facts which the\ngovernment has proVed. He cannot\naffard, he has not the power, to\nmake use of such processes of In\ni quiry as the government has com\nmand of.

L. Smith urged that a member\nship campaign be inaugurated, as it\nappears there are not more than one\nhalf of the fruit growers in the coun\nty members. With all working for the\ngood\' of the society there would al-)\nways be on hand sufficient money to\ndefray the expenses of representa\ntives who are sent to Charleston and\nWashington in the interest of leg\nislation.\nPresident Clohan said the society\nhad done more for the fruit growers\nof theA state and nation than any\nother body known. He cited the re\ncent laws enacted by the state legis\nlature; and the law by congress re\ngarding the standard apple barrel. In\nthte latter instance every other so\nciety in the country had failed to in\nterest their representatives in the\nSulzer "bill, \' but when the Berkeley\ncounty men got behind it in a few\ndays the measure had passed both\nhouses and was signed by the Pres\nident.\nM*. \'Smith again spoke of the socie\nty and Its reputation abroad. He said\nduring his travels over the state the\npeople frequently said if they had\nsuch an organization It would be no\ntrouble to grow fruit.\nThe following report made public\nby the society will prove very inter\nesting and give the people some idea\n?what the apple growers are doing:\nNo. acres In orchard in county 11,000\n^ No. of apple trees 549,815.\nNo. of peach trees 148,043\nof plum trees 6,250\nNo. of pear trees 1S,o23\nNo of cherry tree* 4,923\nNo. of quince trees 1,742\nAt 3:30 the society was discussing\ntha cedar rust.

The increase in value in 12\nmonths was placed at $443,750,000.\nwhile the total value of all classes\nof farm animals reached $5,506,024,\n000.\nOf this total horses furnished $2.\n185.555,000; mules $529,339,000, and\nmilch cows, $1,032,960,000. By way\nof comparison the total value repre\nsented 50 per cent more than the\ntotal money in circulation in this!\ncountry, and was almost equal to\nall deposits in the 7400 national\nbanks in existence.\nThe numbers ot\' meat-producing j\nanimals, however, showed a de\ncrease, beef cattle recording a fail\ning off of 1,762,000 head, or 5 per\ncent; lings, a decrease of 4,982.000,\nor 7 per cent. Milch cows showed no\ni\nmaterial change, while horses in- J\ncreased slightly in number. The de\ncrease in numbers caused a heavy]\nincrease in average value per head;\nmilch cows advancing 21 per ^cnt;\nother rattle, 18 per cent; hogi;, 17 j\nper cent; and sheep. 8 per cent.\nThe decrease in hogs was the re-;\nsuit of heavy cholera losses in im\nportant States, coupled with a short-!\n?ige in corn, while the decrease in\nsheep resulted from low-priced aooI\nand dissatisfaction with the wool tar\n?fr. |\nThe decline in the number of beef\'\ncattle has been under way for sev\ni\n<^ral years, and with the increasing\nshortage of beef. The onl>\' hope of\nre1\'?f held out in the report was a\nile.ulation t. at. an ir.c-iiMSo of 30\nper cent in the larnber o* silos in\ndicated a complete utilization of the\nforage of the cornfields, thereby re\nducing the cost of producing beef.\nIt Always Helps\nsays, Mrs. Sylvania V/oods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., in\nwriting of her experience with Cardui, the woman\'s\ntonic.

Although t lie retail\nprices of anthracite coa! may be in\ncreased 10 cents a ton on account of\nthe new Pennsylvania state tax on the\nproduct, there i>< practically no chance\nof a raise before the first of next year,\nnaid dealers in this city.\nTee Pennsylvania legislature im\nposed a tax of \'21 per cent on the value\nof all anthracite at the mines, expo t\niug that it would bring $:>.000,000 or\n^1.000,000 into t lie treasury of the\nstate.\nPolitical economists agree that it is\nth" consumer who pays the tax. The\nfear has been that in addition to hav\ning to do this the retail coal dealer\nmight utilize the new tax as an excuse\nfor jacking up the prices on the con\nsumer away above those actually war\nranted by the state levy. \'J\'lie tax of\n2% per cent on the value of the coal at\ntlie mines would actually amount to\nabout r. cents a ton of the smallest or\nsteam making coal and from 8 to 10\ncents a ton on the larger-or domestic\n*izos. such as chestnut, stove and egg.\nMARK OLD MISSOURI TRAIL\nWoman Drives First Stake to Show\nWay Pioneers Traveled.\nSt Louis, Mo>?Mrs._Jqhn N.

Os\nwald Garrison Yillard and J. E. Spin\ngarn also had a telling effect.\nIt must be said, however, that color\ned men and woiufi are themselves\nlargely responsible for the turning on\nof the light. One colored man here,\nwho prefers tint his name be not\nwade public, enlisted several leading\ndailies in lighting the scheme.\n\'J. Napier, who rave up his posi\ntion as register of the treasury rather\nthan submit to segregation, is entitled\nte praise for focusing attention on the\nnn-Americaii plan. Bishop Walters,\nwhoso attitude was grossly misrepre\nsented. was also an insistent and con\nsistent foe of segregation.\nIn his talks with I\'resident V/11 son\nand other Democratic leaders here he\nalways voiced his disapproval of the\nplan.

Since you r,rote\nme that yon have been Informed by\nthe White House and the treasury de\npartment that no such statement was\nmade to me there Is nothing left for\ntne to do but to infer that I was mis\nInformed or misunderstood and to ex\npress my regret to you that such ap\npears to have been the ease.\'\'\nThough the administration is report\ned to have changed Its attitude regard\ning segregation, there has been no pub\nlic announcement of that fact.
