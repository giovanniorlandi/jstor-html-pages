Witte\'s Notable Career.\nSergius Witte, the Russian plenipo\ntentiary, may be regarded as the lead\ning liberal statesman of Russia. For\nthe last thirteen years he has been\none of ihe strongest personalities in\nthe Russian bureaucracy, although his\npolitical fortunes suffered a setback\nwhen he was compelled to resign the\nportfolio of minister of finance in Au\ngust, 1903, and again when, after being\nappointed president of the council of\nministers in the same month, his office\ngradually lost its importance until ru\nmors of his intention to resign and go\nabroad had\' been persistently circulat\ned.\nWitte is about fifty-six years old\nand has steadily worked his way up\nfrom the position of an underpaid rail\nroad clerk who occasionally acted as\nporter to that of the leading statesman\nof Russia in spite of the fact that his\nenemies are numerous and include\nsome of the most powerful in Russia.\nIn appearance he is a man of large\nstature, big limbed and muscular,\nstanding over six feet high.

Bouligan as minister of\nthe interior is expected dally. General\nTrepoff, the assistant minister of the\ninterior, will probably be his successor.\nThe terrorists have recently renew\ned their warnings against General Tre\npoff with ominous persistence. The\ngeneral is constantly in receipt of let\nters signed by the executive commit\ntee of the fighting organization in\nforming him that his hour has come.\nA .remarkable feature of all the com\nmunications is that the writers all\ntake pains to say that no safeguards\nwill avail to avert his impending doom.\nAt the same time .they tell him he\nneed not be afraid to go abroad in the\nstreets. They add:\n"Your sentence will be executed in\nyour own room. You will die in bed."\nThe terrorists seem to take pride in\nissuing a challenge involving a demon\nstration of their power and resources\nto penetrate the\'armor of the police.\nMoreover, General Trepoff knows\nenough of the resources and desper\nateness of the organization to firmly\nbelieve that the terrorists are able to\nexecute their threat. He makes no\nconcealment of the fact that he ex\npects to be killed, but his nerve is\nunshaken. "I will at least die at the\npost of duty," he said.\nI. _J?i" ately General Tvepaff takes a\ngloomy view of the future of the au\ntocracy,"in which he beliaves." "The\ngeneral is confident that if given un\ntrammelled power he -could restore the\nold status quo in a year, but the pres\nent vacillating policy, he thinks, will\nonly end in ruin.\nNEVER RECOMMENDED IT.\nSenator Depew Tells of Equitable Loan\nto Depew Concern.\nNew York, July 14.Senator Chaun\ncey Depew has made a statement to\nthe Paris correspondent of the New\nYork Tribune regarding the loan of\n$250,000 made by the Equitable so*\nciety to the Depew Land Improvement\ncompany on property alleged to have\nbeen worth only $150,000, in which he\nsays that he never advocated or rec\nommended any such transaction, be\ncause he was a director of the Equita\nble. Senator Depew further says:\n"That loan never could have been\nmade unless the official appraisers of\nthe Equitable board reported after ex\namination that $250,000 was only 60\nper cent of the property\'s value, such\nbeing the rule of the society, and that\non such a report the officers of the\ncompany had uhanimouslv approved\nIt."\nWELCOMED TO PARIS.\nBritish Naval Officers Visit the French\nCapital.\nParis, July 14.Over 100 British\nnaval officers from the visiting squad\nron at Brest arrived here during the\nday and were met at the invalides\nrailroad station by a large party of\nFrench officers.
