It is too had.\nfor we are told that he is a pretty\nnice fellow.\n-W. S. 8.\nDon’t forget that we must raise\n$27,000 in Bolivar county for the\nUnited War Workers in the week\nbeginning November 11th, and\nending November 18th. Even if\npeace comes soon, these workers\nmust look after our boys until they\nare brought back to this country\nand demobilized,\n-w. s. s.\nAfter the Allies whip Germany,\nAustria-Hungary and Turkey it\nwill take almost all our soldiers to\npolice the world for the next few\nyears until the various nations and\nand races settle down. We have\nthe enemy down, hut to have a\nlasting peace we must hold him\ndown and settle disputes among\nthe various new countries to be\nformed after the war. The Mem\nphis Commercial Appeal well says\nthat France, England, Italy and\nthe United States must stand to\ngether as one in the settlements of\nall disputes.\n-W. S. 8.\nWe are to have an election next\nTuesday, November 5th, for the\npurpose of electing a Senator, Con\ngressman, Circuit Judge, Chan\n1 eery Judge, and voting on two\n1 amendments to the Constitution of\nthe Stale. After the very strenu\nous campaign for the nomination\nfor Senator, we expect that the\naverage citizen has just about\nforgotten their choice has to be\nratified at the polls in November,\nft is merely a matter of form in\nthis State, but we should go to the\nPolls aud vote, anyhow. At to the\namendments to the Constitution,\nhe believe both should be defeated.\nIt appears to us that there is a\ngood-sized "nigger in the wood\nPile” in the proposed amendment\n•n regard to taxation; aud the one\nto lower the age limit to 21 years\nfor aspirants\' for the Governor\nship. Seems to be solely in the\niuterest of one man who wants to\nrun for Governor in the next pri\nniary and is not old enough. We\ncould give a number of reasons\nfor opposing both of these amend\'\n•nents, but the Government ask:\n-■». - >■ f.\n| us to conserve white paper—so\nwe will vote against them and let\nit go at that.\n-W. s. S.\nTHE END IS IN SIGHT.\nAccording to newspaper reports,\nthe end of the great world’s war\nis in sight with the United States\nand her Allies victorious on every\nbattle field. Turkey has surren\ndered unconditionally an.’ Austria\nHungary will follow suit within a\nfew days. Then it will be up to\nGermany to quit or fight it out\nalone. If she decides on the latter\ncourse, she can not possibly keep\nup the struggle very much longer\nI and the price to the German peo\n. pie will be something awful.\n! The defeated countries must now\npay for plunging the world into\niwar, and the price should be so\nhigh that no nation or group of\nnations will ever again set out to\nconquer the woald. The United\nStates, France, Great Britain and\nItaly are now in a position to\nassure peace to the world if they\nwill stand together, and there is\nno other way this result can be\naccomplished. We believe these\ncountries that have shared the\nhorrors of war together will stand\nas one in all world matters for\nmany years to come.\nWAR SAVINGS STAMPS AGAIN\nWhen the drive was on for\npledging to buy War Savings\nStamps Bolivar county pledged\nher quota very promptly.

We believe\nour people have been extra good\nabout redeeming their pledges, but\nthere are some who have not done\nsn This article is written for the\npurpose of calling the attention of\nthose who have not bought their\nquota to the fact that they must\ndo so by December 5lh. The\nGovernment needs this money\nbadly and the full amount must\nbe paid.

Roberts,\nCounty Food Administrator,\nRosedale, Miss.\nDear Sir:—\nIn going over allotments of\nsugar, which have been assigned\nto your county, we find that by\ncomparison with your population\nthat you have been allotted 70,000\npounds more than two pounds per\nmonth for your population.\nVVe are making a cut on a num\nber of the merchants, so as to re\nduce the amount of sugar to a\nbasis equal to other counties in\nthe State. It is possible you may\nveas complaints after our next\ndistribution of certificates, and we\ntrust you will assist us in teaching\nthe people the need of confining\nthemselves to the use of two\npounds per month, so that our\nobligations for sugar will be met,\nend the burden may rest equally\nupon all.\nU.s. Food Administration,\nVicksburg, Miss.\nOne trouble with the Rosedale\nallotment of sugar is, hundreds of\nfamilies living in Arkansas up the\nWhite and Arkansas Rivers trade\nhere and are not counted in our\npopulation. We haven t been\nable to even get our two pounds\nper month.\n—\nNEW RULES FOR SALE OF\nSUGAR.\nThe Bolivar County Democrat: —\nPlease advise the retailed groery\ntrade that they are now permit\nted to sell sugar to the consumers\non a basis of one pound for each\nmember of the buyers family dur\n: ing the first half of the calender\n> month.\nThis does not change the regu\n: latious of two pounds per month\n> per person, but permits the con\nsumer to purchase one half of a\nmouth’s supply at one time.\nYours very truly,\nW.

To\nhe read at all these meetings through\nout the Cnited Slates, the Red Croas\nWar Council sent the following an\nimal message covering the work of\nthe Red Cross for the past year:\nTo the Chapters of the American Red\nCross:\nThe War Council sends greetings to\nthe chapters of the American Red\nCross on the occasion of their annual\nmeetings for 1918.\nWith those greetings go congratula\ntions on the great work of the chapters\nduring the past year and, above all\nthings, on the wonderful spirit of sac\nrifice and patriotism which has per\nvaded that work.\nThe strength of the Red Cross rests\nupon its chapters. They are its bone\nand slaew. They supply its funds,\nthey supply its men and women, they\nsupply its enthusiasm. Let us, then,\nreview together the Red Cross story\nof the past year.\nSome Idea of the size to which your\nRed Cross family ha* grown may be\ngathered from the following facts:\nOn May l, 1917, just before the ap\npointment of the War Council, the\nAmerican Ited Cross had 486,194 mem\nber* working through 562 chapters.\nOn July 31. 1918, the organization\nnumbered 29,648.103 annual members,\nbesides 8,099.909 members of the\nJunior Red Cross—a total enrollment\n:he United States.\nSince the beginning\'of the war you\nof the chapters have co-operated with\nthe War Council la conducting two war\nfund drives and one membership drive,\nin addition to the campaign on behalf\nof the Junior Ked Cross.\nThe total actual collections to date\nfrom the first war fund have amounted\nto more than $115,000,000. The sub\nscriptions to the second war fund\namounted to upwards of $178,000,000.\nFrom membership dues the collec\ntions have amounted to approximately\n$24,500,000. t\nSplendid Work Done by Women.\nTo the foregiug must be added that\nvery large contribution of materials\nand time given by the millions of wom\nen throughout the country in surgical\ndressings, in knitted articles. In hos\npital and refugee garments, in canteen\nwork, and the other activities the chap\nters have been called upon to perform.\nIt is estimated thut approximately\n8.000,000 women are engaged In can\nteen work and the production of relief\nsupplies through the chapters.\nFor the period up to July 1, 19^\nAmerican lted Cross chapters, through\ntheir workrooms, had produced:\n490,120 refugee garments.\n7,123,621 hospital supplies.\n10,788,489 hospital garments.\n10,134,501 knitted articles.\n192,748,107 surgical dressings.\nA total of 221,282,838 articles—of an\nestimated aggregate value of at least\n$44,000,000.\nThese article* were largely the\nproduct of women’s hands, and, by the\nsame token. Infinitely more precious\nthan could have been the output of\nfactories or machines. These articles\ngoing to the operating room of the hos\npital*. to homeless or needy refugees,\nand carrying comfort to our own boys\nIn the field, convey a message of love\nfrom the women of tills country entire\nly distinct from the great money value\nattaching to their handiwork.\nMoney Spent in Work.\nBy uie terms unuer wnicn me ursi\nKed Cross war fund was raised, the\nchapters were entitled to retain 25 per\ncent of the amount collected, in order\ndefray local expenses, to carry on their\nhome service work, to purchase ma\nterials to be utilized In chapter produc\ntion and otherwise to meet the numer\nous calls made upon them. The chap\nters were thus entitled to retain nearly\n$29,000,000. As a matter of fact, their\nactual retentions amounted to only\nabout *22.000,000.\nOut of collections from annual mem\nberships, the chapters have retained\nabout $11,000,000.\nFrom this total sum, therefore, of $33,\n000,000 retained by the chapters, they\nhave met all the oftentimes very heavy\nlocal demands upon them, and In addi\ntion have provided for use by hutional\nheadquarters products valued, us\nstHted above, at upwards of *44,000,\n000.\nThe chapters have In effect returned\nto the War Council, not alone the $33.\n000,000 retained out of the war fund\nmembership dues but. In value of\nactual product, an additional contribu\ntion of at least $11,000,000.\nIt will thus been seen that during\nthe eighteen months which have\nelapaed since the United States en\ntered the war, the American people\nwill have either paid In or pledged to\nthe American Red Cross for Its work\nof relief throughout the world.

Hippoc\nrates refers to an epidemic In 412\nB. C., which is regarded by many to\nhave been influenza. Every century\nhas had its attacks. Beginning with\n1831 this country has had five epidem\nics, the last in 1889-90.\nThere is no occasion for panic—Influ\nenza itself has a very tow percentage\nof fatalities—not over one death out\nof every 400 cases, according to the\nN. C. board of health. The chief danger\nlies in complications arising, attack\ning principally patients in a run-down\ncondition—those who don’t go to bed\nsoon enough or those who get up too\nearly.\nTHE SYMPTOMS\nGrip, or influenza, as it is now called,\nusually begins with a chill, followed by\naching, feverishness, and sometimes\nnausea and dizziness, and a general\nfeeling of weakness and depression.\nThe temperature is from 100 to 104,\nand the fever usually lasts from three\nto five days. The germs attack the\nmucous membrane or lining of the air\npassages, nose, throat and bronchial\ntubes; there is usually a hard cough,\nespecially bad at night; oftentimes a\nsore throat or tonsillitis, and frequently\nall the appearances of a severe head\ncold.\nTHE TREATMENT\nGo to bed at the first symptoms, not\nonly for your *wn sake, but to avoid\nspreading the disease to others—take\na purgative, eat plenty of nourishing\nfood, remain perfectly quiet and don’t\nworry. Quinine, aspirin or Dover’s\nPowders, etc., may be administered by\nthe physician’s directions to relieve the\naching. But there Is no cure or spe\ncific for Influenza—the disease must\nrun Its course. Nature herself will\nthrow off the attack If only you keep\nup your strength. The chief dangei\nlies In the complications which may\narise. Influenza so weakens the bodily\nresistance that there Is danger of pneu\nmonia or bronchitis developing, and\nsometimes inflammation of the middle\near, or heart affections. For these rea\nsons It Is very important that the\npatient remain in bed until hts strength\nreturns—stay in bed at least two days\nor more after the fever has left you, oi\nIf you are over SO or not strong stay\nIn bed four days or more, according tc\nthe severity of the attack.\nEXTERNAL APPLICATIONS\nIn order to stimulate the lining ot\nthe air passages to throw off the grippe\ngerms, to aid in loosening the phlegm\nand keeping the air passages open, thus\nmaking the breathing easier, Vick’s\nVapoRub will be found effective. Hot,\nwet towels should be applied over the\nthroat, chest and back between the\nshoulder blades to open the pores.\nThen VapoRub should be rubbed In\nover the parts until the skin Is red,\nspread on thickly and cover with two\nthicknesses of hot flannel cloths. Leave\nthe clothing loose around the neck, as\nthe heat of the body liberates the In\ngredients In the form of vapors.\nThese vapors. Inhaled with each breath,\ncarry the medication directly to the\nparts affected. At the same time\nVapoRub is absorbed through and\nstimulates the skin, attracting the\nblood to the surface, and thus aids\nIn relieving the congestion within.\nHOW TO AVOID THE DI8EA8E\nEvidence seems to prove that this Is\na germ disease, spread principally\nby human contact, chiefly through\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. So\navoid persons having colds—which\nmeans avoiding crowds—common\ndrinking cups, roller towels, etc. Keep\nup your bodily strength by plenty of\nexercise In the open air, and good food.\nAbove all, avoid colds, as colds Irri\ntate the lining of the air passages and\nrender them much better breeding\nplaces for the germs.\nKEEP FREE FROM COLDS\nUse Vick’s VapoRub at the very first\nsign of a cold. For a head cold, melt a\nlittle VapoRub In a spoon and Inhale\nthe vapors, or better still, use Vapo\nRub In a benzoin steam kettle. If this\nIs not available, use an ordinary tea\nkettle. Fill half-full of boiling wa\nter, put in half a teaspoon of VapoRub\nfrom time to time—keep the kettle\njust slowly boiling and Inhale the\nsteam arising.\nNote—Vick\'s VapoRub Is the dis\ncovery of a North Carolina druggist,\nwho found how to combine, In salve\nform, Menthol and Camphor with such\nvolatile oils as Eucalyptus, Thyme, Ca\nbebs, etc., so that when the salve Is ap\nplied to the body heat, these Ingredi\nents are liberated in the form of va\npors.\nVapoRub Is comparatively new la\nNew Tork State and New England and\na few Western states where It is Just\nnow being Introduced, but In other sec\ntions of the country It is the standard\nhome remedy In more than a million\nhomes for all forms of cold troubles.\nOver six million Jars were sold last\nyear. VapoRub can be had In three\nsizes at all druggists. It Is particular\nly recommended for children\'s croup\nand colds, since It Is externally applied\nand therefore can be used as freely as\ndesired without the slightest harmful\neffects.\n“Wormy." that’s what’s the matter of \'em.
