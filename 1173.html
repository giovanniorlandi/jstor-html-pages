The, fortune she has left is close to $100,, 000,000. The richest woman in Am, erica, she lived almost as frugally as, a shop girl. Her home was wherever, she chose for a time to hang her lit, tle cape and bonnet, often In the, hail bedroom of some cheap boarding, house or in some remote and modest, flat around New York., Her eccentric extremes of economy, led to a popular misconception of her, as a "self made woman." As a mat, ter of fact she was born rich. In 1805, she inherited some $10,000,000, which, accumulated upon Itself until in fifty, years it had multiplied nearly ten, times. She also inherited family tra, ditions which had been a pride for, three centuries, and which she was, anxious to perpetuate in her children., She was born at New Bedford,, Mass., "in November, 1834, about the], L\'oth," according to her testimony at, one time in court. She was a de, scendant on her mother\'s side of, Henry Howland, brother of i’ilgrim, John Howland, of the Mayflower., In succeeding generations the llow-i, land family became famous in the, whaling industry and shipping trade, with China, and had an irreproaeh ;, able social standing. Kdward Tlott, Robinson, who had also amassed a, fortune in a similar way in New Bed, ford, married Abby Howland, of whom, Hetty Robinson, the future mistress, of finance, was born. She was sent I, to a Quaker school on (’ape Cod, and, A.I__ In .. » K.vn, first lessons in finance when her age, ing father entrusted her with some], of his books., She was just thirty years old when I, her father died suddenly, leaving her, his nine millions, one million outright, and the Income from the other eightj, the principal to be held in trust for, her children, it is forgotten thatj, Hetty (Jreen, then Robinson, was aj, belle in New York society. According!, to her own stories she ‘‘often danced, the whole night through." Kven then, |, however, she lived in a hoarding, house, and was so saving that rather, thun pay carfare she would pull a, pair of heavy woolen stockings over, her shoes and walk through the snow ;, to parties., Almost at. the same time that her!, lather died her aunt, Sylvia Ann How, land, passed away, leaving several, million dollars. It is said Hetty Rob-;, inson had been brought up from child, hood to count this money as hers, and!, that the aunt experssed the hope that j, Hetty would some day become, as she, did, the richest woman in the country., The division of the aunt\'s estate,, however, was not as expected. Three j, years after the aunt\'s death Hetty, Green appeared in the United States I, circuit court in Massachusetts with, a will which she wanted substituted, for the one already probated. This, will was in Mrs. Green\'s own hand, writing, and some of the most famous, experts of the day declared under, oath their belief that the two signa, tures it contained were not made by, the aunt, but were traced by Hetty, Green herself over an original signa, ture of Sylvia Ann Howland., The litigation is one of the most, famous In court annals. After an ex, pense of. $172,000, the case was dis, missed on a technicality. An appeal, w as made to the supreme court of the, United States, but while this was pend, ing a private settlement was reached., From those days to the time of her, death Hetty Green was involved in, some law suit of other, asserting that, lawyers were forever trying to ro!>, her of her property. Her antipathy, toward them was so violent that she, said: "I would rather have my daugh, ter burned at the stake than to go, through what 1 have with lawyers.”, She married in 1867. Her husband, was Edward H. Green, who was, United\' Suites consul general in Ma, nila, where he hail made a fortune in, the silk trade. It is said Green, at, a public dinner, heard some one speak, of Hetty Kobinson as "the greatest, American heiress,” aud straightaway, announced his determination to marry, her. Before the wedding day an, agreement was signed to the effect, that the wife\'s fortune should never, be drawn on to meet the husband\'s, debts or any of their joint expenses., He died in 1802, after having lost most, of his money in Wall Street., A. W. Gardner and Captain H.

The second joke was given when we were forced, to send the entire United Stales army to fight one murderer, and' a parcel of magmuffins.”, A third joke, worthy to be added to these, is the recent dec, laration of Henrv Ford, who believes that no nation should be, prepared to defend itself, Chat he doesn’t know anything about, history, and doesn’t want to—Minneapolis Journal., -:o:, DEBTORS TO COL. RICHARDSON., The appropriation by Congress ot $o()0,(MM) tor Alaskan |, roads is additional evidence of the groat debt ot gratitude j, owing by the people of Alaska to Col. Richardson, more than I, any other influence, who has kept the policy alive during all, the years that has followed. He has talked millions out of, congress for the roads of the north., And, general I v speaking, these millions ot dollars ba\\“, hi mi well spent. The government and the people of Alaska j, have been given 100 cents of value per dollar ot expenditure. |, As a result of the work of the road commission, of which Col. j, Richardson has been the head ever since its organization. I, means of travel in Alaska has been immensely improved. Tliej, read development has given ns automobiles to run where pack!, train were formerly used, and many men are employed in mines, that would never have been opened if Col. Richardson’s road, and trail makers had not followed the discoverers ot gold., This new appropriation, it is believed, marks the inaugu, ration of a road building policy on a much larger scale. It is, the beginning of the fruition of the repeated recommendations, of Col Richardson and Gov. Strong that millions are expended, in the development of a comprehensive road construction, policy for the government.—Juneau Empire., — -— :o:, HUMANIZING THE CORPORATION., The old saying that corporations have no souls lias been, used many times to characterize their alleged heartlessness., It has not been as often understood to constitute a handicap to, them, lmt there is no doubt that a corporation suffers a disad, vantage, and a serious one, in business even it it is only found, ed on sentiment, as compared with an indi\\idual, because it, has no personality. This lack it is the duty of the management, to supply as far as can be through utilizing the individuality, of the officers. Of two electric railways which are giving good, service, that one will en.jov the greatest public favor in which, the personality of the management enters. Such a situation, often occurs in the case of run-down proproties which have, been taken over by new managers and successfully rejuvenated., Her,, tbe public can give credit where credit is due, and it usu, ally does so. Hut with the older and' long established company, the task is more difficult, though none the less important. So, long as tin* patrons of a railway look upon it merely as a trans, portation producing machine, with no personality behind it., a friendly attilode i- impossibt *. It is perfectly natural, there- j, fore, that the popular electric railways should, as a veule, bcj, those which make an effort to develop this individuality or per, sonality through their leading executive officers.—Electric, Railway Journal., -:o:, NEWSPAPER COST., War conditions have caused advances in prices in many, lines of merchandise and the like, and, while much has been, said on that score, comparatively little has been mentioned of, the way the newspapers have hgd to pay far higher charges, for most of their important supplies., The cost of print paper has advanced very materially., The prices of inks have advanced., There are many other supplies that enter into newspaper, printing that also cost much more now than they did a few, months or a year ago., Yet the newspapers are the very last to take any steps, whatever in advancing their prices and they certainly make, no move to try to cut down the wage scale., These are facts that all friends of the newspapers ought to, take into consideration and further manifestations of the en, terprise, progress and determination shown by the newspapers, under all conditions in seeking continually to give their pat, rons the best than can be furnished them in the way of news, paper endeavor.—Exchange., WM.

Wins, low, the American consul general, here., “It is a very significant fact," he, said to the Associated Press corres, pondent, "that American goods are, going to Russia, Germany and Aus, tria are passing through Danish ports., The Danes are now frankly claiming, that Copenhagen, with its free har, bor, the only one in Scandinavia, has, supplanted other ports having free, harbors as a continental distributing, center. I believe this port will be, able to hold its advantage when peace, comes, to hold the bulk of its for, warding commerce already obtained., | “Goods can be transshipped from, j here to all port* of the world, as, cheaply and as expeditiously as from, any other European port, especially, if the final destination be Norway., Sweden, Finland and the Germanic, Baltic ports., “There are no hindrances to the es, tablishment of agencies by Ameri, cans in Denmark. Warehouses can, be operated in the free port in which, stock can be eat*ried. An authorized, agent is recommended to handle Am, erican trade., “Denmark has in its geographical, position and in its land formation, unique qualifications for the develop, ment of important export and transit, trades. Owing to climatic conditions, ,Denmark must import from countries, j of milder climates rice, coffee, tobac, co and colonial goods in general, also, I cotton, jute and other materials for, ! its textile manufactures, and l)rom, ! countries nearer home wool, flax and, hemp. The country possesses no for, ests, nor does it produce either coal,, iron or other minerals; it is, therefore,, compelled to import from abroad tim, ber, coal, petroleum, iron, steel, lead,, tin, copper, zinc, etc., besides oreagi, nous seed for crushing, oleomargar, ine, wood pulp, cork, dyestuffs and, many other similar goods, also feed, ing sturfs to satisfy the growing re, quirements of the farmer, and fin, ally great quantities of manufactured, for general consumption., So ennfmoua an import of foreign, goods demands by necessity a corres, ponding export of home produce. The, export of Danish farm produce and, of the fishing industries alone con-;, •■■irleiv. Sly exceed the t ital imports,, and to this must be added the export, of Dan \\ manufactures which is not, at all an insignificant Item. The ex, port of Danish home products are, further augmented by a large regu, lar re-export of foreign goods., "From olden times the Danish cus, toms regulations have oeen framed, .vlth a view to the encouragement, of transit trade., "Through the large and fully equip, ped free harbor the merchant Is able, to Import and export goods from and, to all parts of the globe, without be, ing In any way hampered by duty or, other customs regulations. In Ills ef, forts to expand the transit trade the, merchant Is extensively supported by, the Danish hanks, whose business is, conducted on thoroughly modern lines, and whose trustworthiness is well, known and generally recognized., Copenhagen is the largest bank cen, ter In northern Europe., “In the year 1913 there arrived in, the harbor of Copenhagen (Including, the free harbor) 12,021 steamers with, a total of 4.382,00(1 registered tons., and 9,527 sailing ships with a total, of 336,000 tons., "The harbor is supplied with all, appliances. A special quay is the, landing place for the traffic with Am, erica., “From the foregoing facts I atn of, the belief that American merchants, should fully investigate the question, of locating agents or representatives, /, at Copenhagen N\'o dlsar-qv able gov, ernmental restrictions are !n force, and foreign merchants are welcomed.”, -: o:, DANCES SCHEDULED FDR, THE FOURTH AND FIFTH., The two big dances to i;i given in, connection with the Fourth o.
