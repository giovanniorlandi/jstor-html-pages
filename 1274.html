( inn expert, J B Bren»*rn *ti of Lend, j ville. examining the Keystone mine, ■ Mr A 15 Williamson one of the, owners of the property, came here, [ from Durwnuo and took the parties, 1 1 over to the mine. It is understood, j that should the report of this expert, 11 be favarahle, this old mine will l»e, j developed ns it never has been be, fore M»id a mine made there if the, j ore expected is found.

They have already exam, ined a ntimber of promising claims, which have been sun pie <1 by them, anil they may liegin working one, or more of these. What this conn, »ry needs is men having knowledge, ••f mines and how to develops* and, mnkc mines after the ore has been, found. There are old, prospects in this mining district, which would make mines if the, proper men had hold of them and, who would follow the ore in sight, until they made shipping pay mines, from what never had but shallow, surface workings, The sale of the Star Mine on It, alian Mountain should mean much, for this part of the country especial, ly if they work the property as is, proposed by the new owners This, and the Bull Domingo property, shipped thousands of tuns of ore, some years back, the most of winch, was packed down Cement or Spring, Creek to Jax Cabin for shipment, and it is now the shortest way by, miles, to the nearest lending point, »xcept at the B<»cker switch, seven, miles below Ci Bntte* The most, practical wagon route from this, mine to the railroad, is down the, small stream leading from tbe pro, perty to Dorchester and thence, down Taolu: River Canon tc Jacks, Cabin or Almont. This would not, only furnish au all down grade but, bo an all the year road for the haul, r ing of ore and mine supplies for the, r whole Italian Mountain and Taylor, Park mines It is hoped that the, \' people of this sic lion will iosist on, ] this road being put through at once, jand back it up with se.ffiuieut in, finance ami money to push it to, completion before the summer is, uver, THE CELEBRATION., It ia doubted if the towns people, of Crested Bujfte ever got up and, carried out a more interesting 4th, of July celebration, than whs the\', on?

No provision has, been or Is being made for the growing, demands of the country, and as trans, portation is the backbone of business., Its weakness or inefficiency cripples, every other condition; because all prod, ucts are valuable In the ratio with, which their accessibility to the con, suming market., It Is most important to the shipper,, that railroads at all times are fully, equipped to take care of an Increase of, his business. The first eight months of, 1907 demonstrated that the railroads, could not handle the business then of, fered with any degree of satisfaction., The financial conditions since have not, permitted them to even maintain their, then position. If the then volume of, business were to come back supple, mented by the three years growth of, the country In the Interval, transporta, tion would be paralyzed; and what, would that cost the shipper compared, with a reasonable advance In freight, rates now? Such an advance would, provide the means for avoiding this, Impending disaster. The Iron horse, needs to be kept in good condition for, the same reason as the living horse, used for transportation. The team, ster kqows that If his horse Is not, well shod, well groomed and well fed., and his harness and wagon kept In, good repair, that all he will save on, such economy will be many times, wasted In the efficiency of his trans, portation, and also add great expense, to the shipper. It Is exactly the same, with the railroads- the shipper has a, right to demand that transportation, be ample and efficient; the success of, hlx business and the development of, the country are dependent on it., The Investor: To do this, the rail, road must show adequate returns to, maintain proper borrowing credit and, present a promising source of invest, ment to procure the necessary funds, to improve and develop the property, as needed. It is neither the railroad, president nor the shipper that controls, the situation; It Is the investor alone, . who holds the key; without his un, invested dollar the railroad cannot ex, tend or Improve, no matter how great, the needs of the shipper or the country, may be., With all the increasing cost of op, eration. supplemented by ever in-, I creasing and burdensome legislative, I restrictions concerning their earnings., | in face of the fact that the average, dividend rate on railroads was less, than 3H per cent for the past six, years, and the United States Supreme, Court In the case of the Consolidated, Gas Company stated that ”G per cent, was a fair return on money invested, in public utilities," with the average, freight rate In 1909 of three-quarters of, a cent per ton per mile, the lowest In, \' nine years, the average passenger rate, per mile, one and nine-tenths cents,, the lowest ever reached. Is it any won, der that the investor holds back and, the Bankers demand high Interest, rates from the railroads? The railroads, \' need $2,000,000,000.00 to put their lines, In proper condition, and to increase, their terminal facilities at all points, that are even now a necessity, and, $1,000,000,000.00 more for modern new, Incorrect Phraseology., Speaking of the comet as a ‘Celes, tial wanderer,” when its orbit is fixed, and known and its place in the heav, ens determined at any time, Is about, as correct as speaking of a "dash to, the pole” when the dasher is doing, well to make ten miles a day.— New, York Tribune., Leisure Essential., Trees, fields, sunsets, rivers, breeses, and the like, must all be enjoyed at, leisure. If at all. There is not the, slightest use in a man’s paying a hur, ried visit to the country. He may as, well go there blindfolded as go in a, hurry. He will never see the coun, try. He will have a perception, no, doubt, of hedgerows and grass, of, green lanes and silent cottages, per, haps of great hills and rocks, of vari, ous Items which go toward making, the country; but the country itself be, will never see.—Country Parson., motive power and equipment to more, their freight with promptness and econ, omy. Where can they got the money T, Only by lncreeeed earnings from ad, vanced rates, and by no doing better, their credit by attracting the uninvest, ed dollars that are now going to other, more attractive but less productive In, vestments., What will the advenes cost the Ul, timate Consumer? Poor\'s Manual eays, the average haul of all freight In 190$, was 142 miles. The average rate la, 1909 was three-fourths of a cent per, ton per mile., The average total rate for the aver, age total haul, assuming It to be the, same as 190$, would be sl.os per ton., An advance of 10% on this rate would, Increase the cost 10 cents per ton.., or 1-200 of a cent per pound. An ad, vance of 10% on the present specific, rates would increase the cost of 10$, pounds dressed beef in New York,, shipped from Chicago. 4H cents; 100, pounds canned fish In 8l Louis,, shipped from Maine. 1 $-10 cents; 100, pounds flour In New York, from Min, neapolis. 2 cents; a suit of clothes la, Chicago, from Boston. Vfr cent; the, same for a woman’s sulL On a man’s, outfit, coat, trousers, shoes and hat., New England to Mississippi Valley, not, to exceed 1 cent. The Ultimate, Consumer can multiply these Illustra, tions Indefinitely. The manufacturer,, jobber and retailer could easily absorb j, this slight advance, because. If his, business Increased but one unit, that, would more than pay the increased, cost on one hundred units., Railroad net earnings thus Increased. :, the railroads would have a ready mar, ket for their securities, and with the, money thus obtained again start all ., the business and Industries now com, paratively Idle that are directly or In, directly dependent on their property, j, The working men would be fully em, ployed, their families would again pur, chase freely, end that means good ., business for everyone., There are 1.500.000 railroad em, ployees It takes 2.500.000 men to sup, ply what the railroads need, and a vast, number of men are employed In sup, plying the personal needs of the above, 4.000.000 men and their families, rep, resenting 16,000.000 people. Every, kind of business Is dependent in some, measure on railroad prosperity., High cost of living: If It had not been, for the encouragement given railroad i, investors in the past, where would we, have been to-day for our food supply? j, They opened up thousands of miles, of undeveloped and unproductive land, and yet our food la high, because of, lack of supply; our consumption is in, creasing faster than our food produo-j, tlon. If the railroad Investor stops as, be now has. there will be an advance, In food rates soon that will be far, greater than lncreaaed freight rates., High food means high labor, and high, labor means high everything. There, fore the Ultimate Consumer and tbs, State and National Governments should, be Interested In developing land that, will produce bountiful food products., Half of the country west of the Mis, sissippi Is not used, and will not be, until covered with railroads.

A. GRIFFIN REPLIES TO, DAILY NEWS EDITORIAL ON, FREIGHT RATE ADVANCES, (From Chicago Dally News.), Mr. Griffin Replies., I desire to call attention to an edito, rial printed in The Daily News, May, 2L headed "Back Fire on the Shippers,", In which you make the following state, ments: First, that my representation, of the case is net candid; second, that, what I did have to say was based upon, the action of the shippers’ conference,, and. third, that I had no right to pose, as a business man having Interests in, common with the shippers., The circulation for signatures of a, statement relating to freight rates was., as far as I was concerned, confined to, fellow members of the Railway Busi, ness association, and no reference was, made to the shippers’ conference. I, personally attended this conference, and have no criticism to make on any, thing that was done there and none, was made or Intended by me, but what, I "deprecated" was contained In an ar, ticle sent out by the Illinois Manufac, turers\' Association, dated May 7. and,, as a member of that Association, I, personally wrote a letter to each of lta, Individual members, dated May 17. In, this I referred to the misleading and, unfair statements contained in the, circular of May 7 mentioned above, and, In doing so I was "candid." I said, that the statement "that railroads are, rapidly increasing their net earnings", was not true and as to the correctness, of my statement 1 beg to refer to the, following:, The latest interstate-commerce com, mission reports show that during the, month of March eleven systems, repre, senting every railroad north and west, on a line drawn through Chicago and, SL Louis, show an Increase in gross, earnings for the month of March, of, Dearly $7,000,000 compared with March., 1909, while the net earnings for the, same roads In the same period show, a decrease of $965,000; and the Inter, state commerce commission figures for, the ten months, July to March 31. In, 1910, as compared with 1909, show an, increase In gross of over $50,000,000,, while the net earnings of these same, systems In the same period of compari, son. show a falling off of over $3,500,-, 000. And. as comparatively little of, the increases in wages had even gone, into effect during March, the railroads, must provide some means to Increase, a revenue that Is already decreasing, on an Increased amount of business,, and there Is no way for railroads to, provide this except by increasing their, ,‘ates. and surely there is "reason for, the need of 1L", In the third paragraph on the sec, ond page of this Illinois Manufac, turers’ Association circular of May 7, It is stated that 7.99 per. cent waa, earned on the dividend-paying stock,, making no allowance for the 34 per, cent, of stock on which no dividends, wore paid. I might, with equal propri, ety, make the statement that there, was no dividend paid on the non-dlvl, BOYS TAKE A BACK SEAT, Spelling Contests Held in New Orleane, Prove Girle Superior to Their, Brothere., The result of the spelling contests, In the New Orleans public schools, again demonstrates the superior pro, ficiency of the girls, practically all of, the victors being members of the, gentler sex. Last year the same thing, was true and the matter was quite, generally commented on In the press, and at gatherings where educational, subjects were discussed., So far as our Information goes there, have been no contests to determine, the pupils In other branches of study,, but It would be Interesting to know, If this feminine superiority Is found, to exist in all studies, or If they are, confined only to particular branches., Doubtless this result Is due In part to, the fact that the female mind ripens, at an earlier age than Is the case with, the masculine mind, although there is, little doubt that the feminine intel, lect along certain lines Is more acute, than th« masculine, which would seen,, to justify the conclusion that certain, branches of study are more readily, mastered by girls and women., In view of the growing number of, young women that are going into po, sitions as stenographers, typewrltlsts, and other positions requiring an ac, curate knowledge of spelling, this dem, onstrated proficiency Is most gratify, ing. The public school administra, tion Is to be commended upon the ef, forts it has made to Improve the, spelling of the public school pupils, and the triumphant girls to be con, gratulated upon their easy victory, over the boys., Long Walt., "Why don’t you wait on a sport, like me?" demanded the patron who, had made the tenth unsuccessful at, tempt to give nis order for "ham, and —", "8port!” laughed the sarcastic, waiter, "you look like a sport. Why,, you need a shave!", "Well, that’s your fault if I do. 1, didn’t need It when I came in.”, Invitation Accepted., It is told that a certain lady of a, western Kansas town desired to show, kindness to the captain of the local, state militia company and wrote the, the following Invitation: "Mrs., requests the pleasure of Captain \'s, company at a reception on Friday eve, ning.”, A prompt reply came: "With the, exception of three men who are sick, with measles. Captain ’s company, accepts your kind Invitation and will, come with pleasure to your reception, Frida/ evening.", dend paying stock. For a clearer defi, nition, the average earnings should be, based upon the entire stock, and not, upon the best paying portion of it, un, less there is some reason why the, $2,600,000,000 representing the 34 per, cent should not have received any divi, dends at all., In the final paragraph of the edito, rial it is stated that I should not be, allowed to pose as. a business man,, "having oo interest In common with, the shippers." Inasmuch as my con, cern shipped an average of 350,000 tons, of finished product during 1906 and, 1907, and we were obliged to receive, more than 350,000 tons of iron to fur, nish this, plus enormous quantities of, coke, coal and other supplies, I cau, safely claim to have shipped in and, out 750,000 tons a year, and aa there, are no railroads who can afford to haul, this material, or any part of It, without, having a revenue from it, an Increase, of 10 cents a ton on my hauling charge, would amount to $75,000 and. there, fore, I have "business” interests in com, mon with other shippers." The 350,000, tons of finished product shipped repre, sented in the neighborhood of $10,000,-, 000. This $10,000,000 represented most, ly labor, with the exception of the, cost of the ore and coal in the mines., All the balance was made up of wages, and profit on the different conditions, of the raw material until It was fin, ished product., My Illinois plants produced 60 per, cent of this amount, or $6,000,000 a, year. For three years our Chicago, plants have not run more than half, capacity. Therefore, there waa $3,000,-, 000 a year less in distribution because, of a corresponding shrinkage In sales., As most of our iron and coal comes, from Illinois, this $3,000,000 a year was, not distributed In Chicago, as would, have been the case had we worked on, the same output that wo did in 1906, and 1907. And a great deal of that, $3,000,000 which was not paid was, taken out of the business firms situ, ated in or near Chicago by the non, purchases from their varied business, on the part of the community that, would have received the $3,000,000 a, year for three years. That is the rea, son why I have a right, as a business, man. to deprecate any unfair or un, called-for obstacles that are placed In, the way of my business and the hun, dred other varieties of business In this, country that are affected by the money, put Into circulation by the railroads., When it is further considered that my, business constitutes but 10 per cent, of the cost of a car and that there, were nine other units similarly affect, ed, most of which would have been, tributary to Chicago, anyone can so#, how Important It Is to his Individual, Interests that the railroad companies, should have ample funds to make those, improvements and purchases, and will, realise how comparatively easy It will, be to stand a reasonable advance on, the freight for any material he will, need. If he Is receiving Increased, orders., Chicago. T. A.
