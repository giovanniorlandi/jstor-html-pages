Tin\nmen remained there a year, but gave m\nsign o\'f relenting.\nA few weeks ago some of the B ?er\nwere told t\'hev must go to work iu oiu\nof the military cemeteriis. They refuser\nand were expelled from Hawkins Hand\nlanding\nat Hamilton, where they estab\nlished miniature laager one one of tin\npublic wharves.

This mine was bought by the Dew\ney outfit. The Dewey outfit is eomposoVl\nof Ed. Dewev, of Xaanpa, Idaho, and a\nprominent gentleman of Pittsburg, Pa.\nThey have closed the mill down for re\npairs. The\' "LincoUn mine, near the Check\nmate, Ibhough a new mine, is clearing up"\n$7,000 per week. A prospect within a\nfew hundred feet of (the Checkmate is\narranging to place a mill.\nEveryone who was fortunate enough to\nsecure claims arc busy sinking shafts.\nAhese shafts are sunk lik ? a large wa\nter well, except there is a -partition of\nlumber phveed through Me center for the\npurpose of ventilation. A roller is plac\ned in a frame (illis roller resembles the\nroller of a* cane mfll), a wire rope is fas\ntcsened to this roller. A "horse is at\ntached to the lever and goes around like\nI ,t cane mill. A barrel is ?fastened to this j\nrope, and let down the shaft by lever. |\n;nd drawn up tilled with mud, water,\nlock, or ore, by lior.se.
