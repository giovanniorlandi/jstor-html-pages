Monroe\nof Rio Graude Cfty stated today\nthat bis reasons for intrndneing\nthe resolution signed by him r.nd\nothers, as the same appeared in the\nhouse journal of the 17ih, vras bas\ned upon tho fact that he, with\nmany of ieuow cinsens, believed\ntfaftt injustice has been done the\npeople of hi district, unhiding\nthe counties of Cameron, Hidalgo\nStarr and Zapata. He claims tha\nhe and his people make no unjnn\ndemand of the state when they asi\ntde state to use her school fund in\nbuilding & railroad from San Ao\ntonio to Brownsville, or from La\nredo to Brownsville, and stripping\nthe question of all sentiment, di\nvesting it of every claim of right\nand placing it alone on the idea of\na pure business proposition, he\nclaims that the school fund, now\nidle, with no prospects of invest\ning it, can be safely invested in\nthe first mortgage bonds of either\nof these railroads, and iu doing so\nno principle of the demontatic par\nty would be brought in question.\n"Our party has never denounced\nor onnosed this idea ot investing\nthe school fund." he said-. \'"Gov\nernor Hogg in his me.v.age to the\nm i t , - ..\njtweiuy-secona legislature, page\n114, house journal, recommended\nit, and he vtas then and hits ever\nsince beeu deemed one of the prin\ncipal exponent of democratic doc\ntrine.\'\n"But it is not upon this idea\nalone that I mate this clxim, but,\nns stated in my resolution : \'-Justice\nto said counties aud the inter\nest of the state in her school fund\ndemand5 that one or both of these\nroads should be built. Why jus\ntice to the comities? Because the\npublic domain of these counties\nhas been taken to build railroads\nin other portions of the state, not\none. but several roads from \'Red\nriver to the gulf,\' as the "populists\nwant, and all oiher sections of the\nstate north, east, south, west and\nmiddle Texas have built their\nrailroads by state aid, by using the\nlands, in part, of the counties, and\nwhen all the laud was taken or\nrailroad scrip issued to cover it all.\nthtMi the constitution of 187G said\nno more aid would be granted to\nbuild railroads. Then-, after tak\ning their lands, the only aid ihey\ncould have, these counties were left\nout off from the balance of the\nworld and left to follow ihe stage\nline of their fathers, while - other\nportions of the state ride io paiace\ncars built with the publio domain\nof mv district:\n11 WhV justice to the stat?
