The local coal dealers\nformed a combination between them\nselves, as has be«n doue in other\ncities, and thought they would heablo\nto say to the 3oho)l Board, ‘‘You’ll\neither give us our prioe^or.you’ll have\ncold school rooms. ” There nre times,\nhowever, when the best arranged\nplans tail ann this evidently wns one\nof them.\nI\na Of coarse the local coal dealers deny\n.1 that there wns any deal onto "do”\nI the oitv atad (her all claim they were\nacting in the most pntriotio manner,\ntliat\nsort of tiling, hut the only way.wooan\njudge is h.v the facts us placed before\nus. W. O. Rook, the manager ol the\nPerth Amboy Supply Company, who\nbid $5 DO per ton ns agninst the $(1.5(1\nof the combine, declares that lie\nknows wlmt lie is about and that\nwhile he does not expect to got rich\noff of the profits in supplying the\nschool hoard with ooal at the price\nquoted, ho is not in business for love.\nOf oonrso wo don’t pretend to bo on\nthe insido of all these combines, lint,\ntaking an ordinary taxpayers view of\nthe matter, the view the Nows always\ntiies to take, it would appear that\nlomebndy thought tlioy lmd a corner\nin the market null got tripped [up.\nThe fact that the school hoard was\npics oil out ror me vict.un is 10 no re\ngretted, for there is no hrAnoli of the\ncity \'government which nooda the\nmoney more. When hundreds ol\nchildren ore clamoring at the doors oi\nonr school honsos bogging for an\neducation and are compelled to wnil\nbecause of lack of money to furuigii\nproper* facilities, it seems almost im\npossible that any combination ooulci\nbe formed to sqneoze any extra inonej\nont of snoli A board. Of coarse tho\ncombination may really and t.i^nly\nhave had no intention of squeezing tin\nsoliool board, bnt, as lias been said be\nfore, not being on the inside and in\nthe face of the faots as now before tin\npublic, whnt else is the ordinary tax\npayer to think\'!\nAnother featnre ill the coal com\nbine’ji bidding which oannot pass an\nnoticed to the avorage observer is tin\nincrease cf twenty-five cents per toi\nIn the two bids offered by tho oom\nbine. One month ago t.\'noy all agreec\nto famish cool for $6.26 and now the;\nwant 98.60. They explain that tin\nprice of oonl has gone np sinco the\nlast bidding. This, to the ordinar;\ntaxpayer, looks strange. Kvorybod;\nknows that coal is cheaper in sainmoi\nthan in winter; that on tho first o;\nApril tile big coal trust throws of\nfifty oents on a ton wholesale,. like\ntossing a sop to a dog, and" then bv\ngins a systematic raise of ten centi\neach month nutii -the old winter price\nis readied. When tire local ooal com\nbine pat in Uieir. first bid of 96 25 pel\ntoil, they certainly knew that tl.e\nschools would not want the coal be\nfore winter and it wonhl seem that\nthey would pat in tlifir hid according\nto winter soheilnle regardless of the\nprioo of ooal today. Now, then, it is\nhard to see how the regular ten oonl\nmonthly inciense of the big coal trust,\nwhioh all know wag coming, and all\nknow anothor is coming next month,\nit is hard to see, wo repeat, how such\na raise would cause a jump in the\nlocal ooinbiue’s bid of twenty-tiyo\ncents on a ton. Of course we mny be\nwrong, but, looking at. the matter\nfrom tho ordinary taxpayer\'s point of\nview, the improssion given is that\nsomebody thought they were in com\nplete coiTtrol, and, i(b if to teach tile\nschool board a lesson for throwing out\nalt the bidB the tlrst timi, thought\nthey would put tho screws on ns a\nwarning not to do It again. From tho\nordinary taxpayer’s point of viow, wr\nnro inclined to think the Perth Am\nhoy Supply Company is not going to\nIobo anything by bidding 95.1)0 per\nton, and as for the oombino—wo don’t\nnow what to think,\nElizabeth is nbout to bnild n public\ndock along her water front. It is\nplanned to hnve a two-story strn oture\nwith tlie first floor dnvotod to freight\nwliilo tho sooond floor will be fitted\nnp ns a reoreation pier. It is an ex\ncellent idea. Perth Amboy can hardly\nnlt\'ord to take suoh action just yet,\nbat, tho question arise*, when tlie\ncity oan afford to build, will thero\nbonny wator front .left? It looks\nplentiful enough now, but now is the\ntime to prepare for the future.\nOh, Pshaw I Would you listen lo\nthis from (he Plainfield Courier\nNows:\nChief Doane nnd Charles Smith, en\ngineer of the fire engino, wero in\nPerth Amboy yesterday, to witness\ntho trial of tlie two new engines thnt\ncity has jnst purchased.

It is generally under\n< stood that the Republicans will name\nformer President of Common Counoil\nJames F. Bookie for tlie office. This\nbeing the case, tho minority party\nwill have to nominate an unusually\nstroug man to make any semblance of\n. a fight.

One thing is\ncertain and that is that if Mr. Bncklu\nis mayor ho will not bo a figure\nhead.--Plainfield Press.\nAnbury Park hotel keepers in their\nfight for Sunday trains and mauioipal\nindajKiiidenco are certainly in earnest.\nWiien n body of men is able to reaoii\na stage of self sacrifice that will oali\ntorr* return of free passes and other\ncomplimentary testimonials of value,\ntlretw i* certainly danger ahead.

For eome of bis earlier work,\nto be found In a sort of guide book Is\nsued many years ago by the Pennsyl\nvanla Railroad, he probably received\nless than one-twentieth of that rate.\nOnly a few Illustrators can command\nso much as $1,000 for a full page maga\nzine Illustration, but several have been\nreceiving such fates for some years\npast, and they often demand the re\nturn of the original picture after the\nplate for the Illustration has been\nmade. Such men probably never ac\ncept less than three or four hundred\ndollars for any of their smallest illus\ntrations.\nThese are men of W9rid\\vide reputa\ntion, though It is generally believeTT\nthat two magazine readers out of\nthree are unable to recognize the style\nof the ablest illustrators, whoso pic\ntures they see a dozen times a year.\nBelow the few illustrators of the flrsl\nrank are many extremely able men\nwho command rates that vary from a\nfourth to a half of the highest. The\nbest-paid men can probably be counted\non the fingers of one hand.\nThe men who command from $100 to\n$500 for a full-page illustration art\nnumbered certainly by dozens, possi\nbly by scores. Many of them, how\never, cannot always maintain pricey\nIf caught when they are hard-up they\nwill undertake to execute work at lit\ntie more than half the usual rate.\nThe men and women who draw for\nthe fashion papers often get very fail\nprices for their work. Some able il\nlustrators are employed by the fashion\npapers to make ideal heads that more\nor less effectively Illustrate bonneti\n“MU WtMUlCO, i’UI OULU piVlUICO IUO\nprice may easily be as much as $50.\nBook Illustration, below that of the\nablest Illustrators, Is not so well paid\nas magazine illustration, but It Is a\ncertain and profitable kind of work for\na large • number of comparatively\nyoung Illustrators. The demand for\nsuch work has enormously Increased\nin the last twenty years, since the rage\nfor popular Action developed.\nA few publishers have occasionally\nattempted to get rid of the Illustrator’s\npay by having illustrnlions made from\nphotographs taken directly from posed\nmodels. Figure work of this kind If\nusually nothing less than ghastly, and\nthe illustrators take the highest delight\nJn the failure of such attempts to\ncrowd them out.\nSome highly successful landscape Il\nlustrations. however, have been made\ndirectly from nature, and some of the\npublishers profess to hope that they\nmay yet succeed with figure Illustra\ntions of the same kind.\niioomcrangeu.\nThe New York man that lost $50,000\nin combining to beat another man Is now\ndown on swindling.\nPlanet Bolls Backwards.\nUranus is the only one of our system\nof planets which rotates backwards.—\nScience.\nGuatemala’s Coffee.\nIt is estimated that Guatemala’s cof\nfee crop thiayear will amounrto 1,000,000\nsacks.\n———————\nCASTOR IA\nFor Infants and Children.\nThe Kind You Have Always Bought\n| California and Return,\nSpecial trains rotn ‘Chicago to San\nFrancisco without change, via the Chica\ngo, Union Pacific and North-Western\nLine leave Chicago^ August 18th and\nAugust 25th.
