I do not believe\nthat it is advisable to sow grain un\ntil it can germinate and come for\nward with a moderately steady\ngrowth.\n"What we are advising, and ad\nvising very strongly, however, is\nthat farmers drag their ground im\nmediately to prevent the loss of\nmoisture. In this dry, windy wea\nther, the soil is losing moisture at a\nrate that is about equal to one good\nrain a week. This is especially true\nwhere the soil has hardened and\ncracked, the cracks leaving vents\nthrough which the moisture can es\ncape. If the ground is dragged and\na dust blanket put over its surface,\nmuch of this evaporation will be pre\nvented."\nBrinkman Buys Auto.\nA transaction was closed yesterday\nwhereby Fred Brinkman, of the\nBrinkman Theatre, of this city, pur\nchased a E.

Fortunately the\nMinnesota legislature manifests in\ndications of a higher civilation.\nAlter the house had passed the\nMackenzie bill abolishing capital\npunishment the attorney general\ncame out with an opinion which,\nwere the attorney general to be taken\nvery seriously, might have jeopard\nized the bill in the senate. The at\ntorney general opined that if the\npresent bill were enacted into law\none Martin O\'Malley, the LeSueur\ncounty murderer, would go scot free.\nGovernor Eberhart who doesn\'t re\nlish the responsibility of naming the\nday on which the state shall proceed\nto strangle the life out of O\'Malley,\nhas refused to permit the execution\nuntil the legislature has expressed\nits complete convictions on the sub\nject.\nNote the difference between the\ngovernor and the attorney general.\nOne refuses voluntarily sanction a\nlegal murder while the other calm\nly interprets the statutes in a man\nner that might jeopardize the Mac\nkenzie bill. "$\nNow comes the lagging informa\ntion that if the senate passes the\nMackenzie bill, as is freely predicted\nit will, the board of pardons will\ncommute the O\'Malley sentence to\nlife imprisonment.\nTHE ELWELL ROAD BILL.\nSenator J. T. Elwell has a good\nroads bill before the legislature\nwhich is of special significance to\nnorthern Minnesota, and inasmuch\nas it does in no way conflict with\neither present or proposed laws will\nappeal strongly to all who study it.\nUnder the provisions of the El\nwell bill, which is an optional mea\nsure, a road may be built at any\ncost to suit the needs of the locality\nin which it is built. It is especially\nadopted to use in northern ^.Minne-\nsota, where long stretches of good\nroads are sorely needed, and where\nit will be made to serve the double\npurpose of being a good road and a\nfire brake at the same time. This\nwould mean protection for large\nareas of forests and growing timber\nand making it easy to patrol long\ndistances in a day with modern con\nveyances.\nThe bill proposes to-permit a\ncounty or counties to lay out and\nfinance new roads under supervision\nof the state highway commission.\nCounty certificates of indebtedness\npayable in from one to ten years are\nauthorized. The county is to be re\nimbursed by the state paying into\nthis fund at least one half the entire\nNO TIME FOR A WHITEWASH.\nIt is not difficult to stir up public\nindignation, and often without real\nfacts to back charges made, where a\npublic institution or public officers\nare concerned, but it is not so easy\nto pile up the mountain of corrobated\ntestimony presented the legislative\ncommittee showing plainly that un\ndesirable conditions exist at the Red\nWing training school.\nThe public pulse thrills at the\nstory of a lad who claims to have\nbeen beaten on the bare skin until\nthe inhumane "disciplinarian" be\ncame exhausted but members of a\nnonprejudiced committee demand\nthat such evidence be substantiated\nby other and more reliable witneses\nand it fell to the lot of former Sena\ntor Stephens, who has won the ap\nplause and thanks of the state, to\npresent an abundance of proof to\nshow that his often repeated asser\ntions that cruelty is practiced at\nRed Wing are indeed founded on\ntruth, no matter how deep the blush\nof shame which mantles Minnesota\'s\nbrow as a result.\nEliminating all testimony offered\nby inmates and former inmates, of\nmothers of inmates and former em\nployes, there remains enough evi\ndence from the lips of the men in\ncharge of the Red Wing institution\nto condemn it while the revelation\nof the investigation as a whole is\nnot a glowing tribute to the manner\nin which the state maintains such\ninstitutions or to the boards and of\nficials who must be held directly re\nsponsible for irregularities.\nMinnesota doesn\'t want a school,\nwhere boys are presumed to be train\ned, in which the youths are flogged\nas were surly slaves in the \'50s, nor\nwherein the lads are made to eat\nfrom swill pails, chained to iron cells,\nor knocked prostrate by blows from\nclenched fists of brute attendants.\nAnd it will appear to most people\nthat the state can get along without\nthe services of a superintendent who\nby his own admission has delivered\nfifty blows on the bare back of a boy\nunder his guardianship.\nThe last thing the investigating\ncommittee should think of is the\nwhitewash brush and the last thing\nto influence the verdict is sympathy\nfor those guilty of the cruelty prac\nticed upon the state\'s wards at Red\nWing. Senator Stephens has estab\nlished the facts as they have existed\nfor a long time and stil exist and will\ncontinue to exist unless a damper is\nplaced on them. It is now up to the\ncommittee to bravely render the ver\ndict which is to be finally passed up\non by the legislature itselfy\\ The\nCommittee has worked bard and long\nand is now in a position to give, and\nit probably will, a fair and unbiased\nopinion as to the reforjns jjejgcjledLajt\nthe reform school.\nWhen you have rheumatism in\nyour foot or instep apply Chamber\nIain\'s Liniment and you will- get\nquick relief.

Like Leonardo da Vinci and\nCyrano de Bergerac, Rousseau was\nhaunted by the dream of aerial navi\ngation. We read: "Men walk on the\nearth, they sail on the water and swim\nIn it. Is not the air an element, like\nthe others? What business have the\nbirds to shut us out of their premises\nwhile we are made welcome in those\nDf the fishes?" Rousseau took no stock\nin any theoi-ies propounded by the\nDarius Greens of his day. He sifted\nthe matter for himself and thought it\ninvolved two problems. First to find\na body lighter than air, so that it\nwould rise. He imagined that sooner\nor later such a body might present\nitself. There was no telling. But\nwhat stumped him was his second\nproblemhow to make that obliging\nbody stop rising and how in creation\nto make it come down. This was too\ntough for Jean Jacques, and he Wound\nup his book by admitting it. For a\nlong time "Le Nouveau Dedale" re\nmained unpublished, appearing only in\n1S01.\nWhen a Ship Turns Turtle.\nTo "turn turtle" means, in nautical\nlanguage, that a ship rolls too heavily,\nfails to recover herself and after a\nbrief period ou her beam ends turns\nlopsy turvy, so that ber keel points\nskyward. Then, of course, she sinks.\nFrequently the compressed air impris\noned in her hull blows her bottom out\nas she goes down, or if she is a steam\ner her boilers burst, with like results.\nAs a rule, ships turn turtle because\nthey are burdened with too much "top\nhamper" or from lack of sufficient bal\nlast, or both causes combined. Rarely\ndoes it happen that there are any sur\nvivors, but there is one notable excep\ntion in the case of the battleship Cap\ntain, which was lost after this fashion\nin the bay of Biscay. In her case ex\nactly three minutes elapsed from the\ntime she first turned turtle until she\nfinally sank, and forty of her crew of\n500 men clambered up her side as she\nrolled over and on to her keel. Of\nthese eighteen men were eventually\nrescued and were able to describe later\non precisely what occurred.Pearson\'s.\nMining For Coffin Planks.\nOne of the most curious industries in\nthe world is the business of mining for\ncoffin planks, which is carried on in\nupper Tonkin, a portion of the French\npossessions in southeastern Asia* In\na certain district in this province there\nexists a great underground deposit of\nlogs, which were probably the trunks\nof trees engulfed by an-earthquake or\nsome other convulsions of nature at a\ncomparatively recent period. The trees\nare a species of pine known to the\nnatives and also to some extent to Eu\nropean commerce as "nam-hou." The\nwood is almost imperishable and has\nthe quality, either through its nature\nor as the result of its sojourn under\nground, of resisting decay from damp.\nThis quality makes it particularly val\nuable for the manufacture of coffins,\nand for this purpose it is largely ex\nported to Europe. The trees are often\na yard in diameter.

It appears, however, that\nafter the scanty rains a small wild\nmelon of bitter taste, but full of juice,\nflourishes in the desert. The jerboa,\nas soon as the melon is ripe, bites off\nthe stem and proceeds to dig away\nthe sand under the melon, so that it\ngradually sinks below the level of the\nground. The constant wind soon cov\ners it with six to eight inches of sand,\nwhich protects it from the scorching\nsun and from drying up. When all\nother moisture has evaporated the jer\nboa goes to his larder and drinks the\njuice of the melon till the rains\' come\non again. One jerboa will bury as\nmany as forty of these little* melons\nto last him through the dry season.\nA Fresh Egg.\nAn English food expert, said in a re\ncent lecture:\n"The secret of health is two meals\na day with an occasional fast.

In fact, by\nthe following method such fowls have\nbeen made as tender as spring chick\nens: Let the bird, after drawing, sea\nsoning and stuffing, simmer until ovet\nhalf done. Then place it in the oven\nwith a piece of pork laid over its\nbreast. I\'our the liquor over and\naround the roast in the pan. Finish\nthe cooking in a very hot oven, bast\ning frequently witb the drippings.\nWhen ready to serve skim off any su\nperfluous fat that may be in the pan\nbefore preparing the gravy. The pork\nprevents the fowl from becoming dry.\nand if a small onion is also added it\nwill have a more savory flavor. The\nsimmering lessens its toughness. In\nfact, slow simmering is just tb^ thing\nfor any tough meat, but it should-sim\nmer, not boil. Boiling will toughen\nthe tenderest of meat.\nA Death Lure.\nAccording to tradition. Kenlth. the\nlegendary king of Scotland, was al\nlured to his death in a most novel man\nner. Kenith had slain a son and broth\ner of Fennella. who to be avenged or\ndered Wiltus. a famous silversmith, to\nconstruct a\' death dealing statue of sil\nver. In jts right hand the statue held\na basin and in the left hand an apple\nof pure gold, both set with diamonds\nand other precious stones. To touch\nthe apple was to defy death, it being\nso arranged that any one guilty of\nsuch vandalism would be immediately\nriddled by poisoned arrows shot from\nopenings in the body of the statue.\nKenith was invited to inspect the won\nder, and, as Fennella had hoped, he\ntried to pluck the precious imitation\nfruit. When his hand touched the ap\nple he was wounded by the arrows and\ndied where he fell.\nAnimal Life on Venus.\n"There are many physical reasons\nfor thinking that if any other planet\nbesides the earth is inhabited it is\nprobably Venus," says Professor Pick\nering. "It is about the same size as\nthe earth, and its density is about the\nsame. The force of gravity upon its\nsurface is only slightly less than that\non the earth. The temperature on\nVenus is probably the same as in our\nown tropics, and the dense atmos\nphere may be of a composition such\nas enveloped the earth when in the\ncarboniferous period. As to the ex\nistence of intelligent life, the question\nIs still open. If it is ever established\nthat the planet Venus is inhabited it\nwill be less surprising than if the same\nwere proved conclusively of any other\nplanet, owing to the similarity in\nmany respects of Venus and the\nearth."\nThought It Was a Joke.\nThe ColonelAnd you actually as\nsert that you want to marry my\ndaughter?
