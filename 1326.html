        <pre>['In Focus: Fair Use and Film\nedited by Peter Decherney\nIntroduction: Permission Culture. In 1989 Gerald Mast concluded an essay\non fair use and film studies with the following statement: \nSince neither the law nor the film industry really cares what film scholars and educators\ndo with these materials [16 mm films, videotapes, and stills], we ought to do as\nmuch as we can. We need to convince, not courts of law and members of the film\nindustry, but our own editors and deans of our rights to do so.1\nToday, Mast’s statement remains half right.\nFirst, it can no longer be said that the law and the film industry do not care\nwhat film and media scholars do with copyrighted material. Mast wrote about\n16 mm film and videotape shown in “face-to-face” classes. But the adoption of\ndigital media has leveled the field. Formats are no longer relevant separators of\ncommercial and noncommercial uses of media. High-quality digital images are\nreadily available for classroom and scholarly use. In addition, the Internet is becoming\nthe distribution medium for both course materials and Hollywood films.\nDigital media and the Internet are increasingly regulated by laws and policed by\nthe film industry. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 and other recent\nadditions to copyright law have begun to regulate all digital media, regardless of\ncontext or use. And the film industry, through the Motion Picture Association of\nAmerica, enforces these regulations actively and universally. As a result, academic\nuses of media are no longer immune from strong control, and academics have\njoined archivists, documentary and independent filmmakers, and consumers as\ncasualties of the attack on fair use in the digital age.\nThe second half of Mast’s formulation—that the gatekeepers (editors and\ndeans), not the law, control fair use—remains as true today as it did eighteen years\nago. Fair use is not a clear legal doctrine. It is a defense of the unauthorized use\nof copyrighted material, developed to facilitate criticism, news reporting, scholarship,\nteaching, and some personal copying, among other uses. These are instances\nwhere asking permission to quote from copyrighted work might impede or even\ncensor the free flow of ideas. Who, for example, would readily give permission for\nquotations to be used in a scathing critique of his or her book or film?\nBecause fair use is defined on a case-by-case basis, it always entails risk. It\nis frequently the publishers and distributors, not the creator of the work, who\ntake the risk—ultimately the risk of a lawsuit. But it is one of the responsibilities\nof editors, deans, university general counsels, and insurance companies to avoid\nlegal action. When weighing the costs and benefits, it will always make more sense\neconomically to pay relatively minor licensing fees or avoid using copyrighted\nmaterial entirely than it will to defend fair use and risk going to court. The\nCinema Journal 46, No. 2, Winter 2007 117\n© 2007 by the University of Texas Press, P.O. Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819\nInFocus.qxp  2/16/07  3:14 PM  Page 117\n', 'inescapable timidity of gatekeepers has led to an environment many have begun\nto call “clearance culture” or “permission culture” in which every use of copyrighted\nmaterial is asked and paid for.2 A permission culture limits academic freedom,\nartistic freedom, and the freedom to record and criticize culture.\nLuckily, the future of fair use is not as bleak as it sounds. The short essays that\nfollow chronicle and analyze some of the most promising attempts to bolster fair\nuse for media scholars, filmmakers, and archivists by both changing the law and\nremoving some of the risks for gatekeepers.\nMy own essay assesses the limitations the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n(DMCA) has placed on fair use. The DMCA trades the broad fair use doctrine for a\nseries of narrowly defined exemptions. But there is no DMCA exemption for media\neducation. In the essay, I recount my attempt, along with two colleagues, to apply\nfor a DMCA exemption that would allow media educators to make clips from DVDs\nor other encrypted media for teaching—a practice outlawed by the DMCA. Many\nCinema Journal readers no doubt make digital clips already, which is all the more\nreason that it should be a legal practice. The essay is about both DMCA exemptions\nand the need for media scholars to take a more active role in the legislative\nprocess, to protect our interests as librarians and others have already done.3\nWhile the roundly criticized DMCA has limited the fair use of digital media,\nit has also helped take some of the responsibility for the distribution of media off\nof Internet service providers—key gatekeepers of the digital universe. Video distribution\nsites YouTube, Yahoo Video, and the hundreds of other sites like them\ncan now offer venues for filmmakers of any kind to display their work without network\noperators and owners fearing for the liability of traditional film and video dis-\ntributors. Fred von Lohmann, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation\nand a voice from the front lines of the digital fair use battles, offers an optimistic\nview of the possibilities for online video. He shows how the DMCA has shifted the\npower to make fair use claims from gatekeepers to filmmakers (a term that in this\ncontext potentially includes anyone with a computer).\nThis shift has resulted in the spread of new forms of filmmaking, including\nvideo diaries or “vlogs” and mashups—short videos made by reediting existing\nmedia. With the burden taken off of gatekeepers, online video-sharing networks\nhave also allowed for a wide range of personal news videos, of the war in Lebanon\nfor instance, that would never have aired on television because they contain violence,\npoor quality video, or extreme political views. On the other hand, operating a service\nas successful as YouTube, which has now surpassed CNN and Amazon in its number\nof visitors, always entails some risks.4 Only days after Mr. von Lohmann com-\npleted his essay, YouTube was sued by the litigious independent news cameraman,\nRobert Tur, who captured on tape the beating of trucker Reginald Denny during\nthe 1992 riots in Los Angeles. When his footage appeared on YouTube without his\npermission, Tur did not claim that the site violated the DMCA. Instead, he invoked\nthe 2005 Supreme Court decision in MGM v. Grokster and accused YouTube of\nbuilding a network through the promotion of copyright infringement—i.e., piracy.5\n118 Cinema Journal 46, No. 2, Winter 2007\nInFocus.qxp  2/16/07  3:14 PM  Page 118\n', 'But what if you want your film distributed offline, shown in festivals, and displayed\non television or in theaters? If you are a documentary filmmaker, insurance\ncompanies and distributors have raised the permission bar to an impossibly high\nlevel. Documentary filmmakers are frequently expected to “clear” every use of\ncopyrighted and trademarked material even when those uses are plainly allowed\nby the law. In response, American University professors Peter Jaszi and Patricia\nAufderheide have spearheaded a fascinating and influential project. They first studied\nthe impact of the permission culture on documentaries and documentarians.\nThe study revealed that the extreme caution of gatekeepers and filmmakers has discouraged\nmany films from being made; it has caused whole genres of documentary\nfilms to atrophy; and, as the title of their report suggests, the permission culture has\nled to countless “untold stories.” The next stage of their project was the creation of\na document outlining “best practices in fair use” for documentary filmmakers. The\ndocument stated and defended the fair use grounds for some of the most common\nuses of copyrighted material in documentary films. Aufderheide and Jaszi’s essay in\nthe current volume chronicles the reception and impact of their project. In a short\ntime, the project has already led to dramatic changes for individual films and for\nthe structure of the permission system. It will surely be a model for other fields.6\nIn addition to the DMCA, 1998 saw the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright\nTerm Extension Act, which extended copyright terms by twenty years and\npostponed the entrance of decades of work into the public domain. This was\nunwelcome news for archivists, scholars, and documentary filmmakers, who both\npreserve and rely on public domain works.\nThe greatest casualties of the extension of copyright terms are the so-called\n“orphan works,” works whose copyright owners cannot be located. When can\norphan films be preserved, screened, or quoted? What do you do in a permission\nculture when you do not even know who to ask for permission? In the spring of\n2005, the U.S. Copyright Office acknowledged the problem and invited the public\nto help solve it. The Copyright Office then prepared a report for Congress and\nstarted the ball rolling towards new legislation. Eric Schwartz has worked on the\norphan works issue for years as an employee of Copyright Office, as an attorney,\nand as an adviser to a range of international organizations that are entrusted with\nthe preservation of film. Here he and his colleague Matt Williams look at the history\nof orphan works legislation and identify a number of currently legal uses for\ncopyrighted films in addition to an account of the orphan work dilemma.\nThere is, of course, another side to this story. Filmmakers, the heads of media\nconglomerates, and anyone with a stake in a media industry are concerned about\nthe impact of digital technology on their art and business. Illegal distribution (i.e.,\npiracy) is a growing problem despite new legislation and court decisions, and new\ntechnology has upset old business models. No industry has more at stake here than\nHollywood. I unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the senior legal staff of the\nMotion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to contribute to this “in focus”\nsection. In their place, Jon Lewis takes account of the MPAA’s war on piracy, and\nCinema Journal 46, No. 2, Winter 2007 119\nInFocus.qxp  2/16/07  3:14 PM  Page 119\n', 'he finds the protection of old business models, tactics for delaying the adoption of\nnew technologies, and nationalist politics lurk not so far beneath the surface.\nTogether, these essays paint a picture of the many ways fair use is rapidly\ntransforming media production and distribution as well as preservation and scholarship.\nIndeed, some of these issues will look very different by the time this issue\ngoes to print. The arrival of video distribution over the Internet is creating both\nnew possibilities and new challenges for lawyers, filmmakers, and scholars alike,\nand legislation on the horizon has the potential to create even greater changes.\nNot only orphan works legislation but an overhaul of major elements of U.S.\ntelecommunications policy is in the offing. Fair use of media will once again\nencounter new limits and (possibly) expansions.\nSignificantly, the current “in focus” section is an almost equally divided collaboration\nbetween media scholars and copyright lawyers. These are two groups\nwhose dialogue is clearly going to become more intense in the near future.\nNotes\n1.

So the drafters of the DMCA inserted a\nsafety valve. Where fair use is harmed, exemptions can be made.\n120 Cinema Journal 46, No. 2, Winter 2007\nInFocus.qxp  2/16/07  3:14 PM  Page 120\n']</pre>
