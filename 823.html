Since being in the\ncity jail Bailey appears to notice\nnothing about him, and for a time re\nfused everything offered him at meal\ntimes. Last night, however, he drank\nall the coffee given him, and also\ncleared the plates of food pushed into\nhis cell.\nBailey, recognized Friday by Officer\nSteward, was at once challenged, and\nhad it not have been for another ne\ngro who stood near, and who be\nlabored the negro convict over the\nhead with a revolver, Bailey would\nhave tried to kill the officer. As it\nwas, he was trying to shoot Steward\nwhen the other negro sent him to the\nmat with a blow over the head with\nthe butt end of a revolver. This stage\nof the proceedings had been reached\nafter the officer and convict had a\nsevere tussle with one another for\nthe possession of the weapons.\nSince Friday the negr opaid no\nevident attention to anything goinf?\non about him. Even when the doctor\ncalled to treat the wounds, the black\nman gave no noticeable recognition of\nhim. The doctor, however, has in\nformed the jail officials that the negro\n"is playing possum," and that he is\nnot as badly hurt as he acts such a\npart. -\nThe Journal "Want Ad.\nWay is the best wey.\nGEBMM CAPTA\nOF iFfl WRITES\nTO FRIEfID HERE\nROBERT TUEMLER RECEIVED\nLETTER FROM COMMANDER\nOF GERMAN PRIZE, IN WHICH\nINQUIRY MADE FOR FRIENDS.\nA letter ha3 been received by Rob\nert Tuemler from his friend, Hans\nBerg, commander of the German war\nprize Appam, which was captured by\nthe German raider Moewe, and\nbrought safely to Newport News by\nCaptain Berg and twenty men from\nthe Moewe.

Florida, under Act of Congress, March 3. 17.\nMONDAY FEBRUARY, 28, 1918.\nPensacola to Accommodate\nHer Winter Visitors.\nThe movement to erect a modern hotel\nwith a number of cottages at some point\nnear the bay or gulf is one that should have\nthe support of all citizens, for it will not\nonly afford accommodations for those vis\nitors who already come here each winter,\nbut also serve to increase the number of\nwinter visitors of the wealthy class very\nmaterially.\nOn Friday a member of The Journal\nstaff, in conversation with a Pensacolian\nWho had visited California this summer,\nwas told the .following story which goes\nfar to show the need here of a hotel and\ncottages near the water.\nThe Pensacolian said that in California\nhe met a very interesting family who had\nspent a great deal of time in this section of\nthe state. The Pensacolian spoke with\npride of Pensacola and the tourist acknowl\nedged the charm of the city, and then said:\n"We did not stay in Pensacola because\nwe wanted to be near the water, and could\nfind no hotel near enough to be convenient.\nThe water was to us the . chief attraction of\nyour city, but we. did not even find on your\nwharves, when we viewed your shipping,\nany resting place in the way of benches or\nseats of any kind, and there were no hotels\nor boarding places near enough to give us\nthe view of the water or the water sports\nthat we wanted."\nThis complaint may have been a bit un\nfair, for there are hotels and boarding\nhouses very convenient to the water. But\nthe fact remains that there is directly upon\nthe bayshore or the gulf beach, no large\nhotel of any kind for the convenience and\npleasure of visitors who come to Pensacola\nespecially for its boating and bathing..\nThe new hotel and cottages, which are\nto be fitted with all modern conveniences,\nwill fill a need that grows with each pass\ning season, for more and more do people in\nPensacola spend their summers at home,\nand there is a constant growth in the num\nber of tourists who visit Pensacola each\nseason, and this number will, increase ac\ncording to the ratio in which it is adver\ntised and the convenience found here after\nthe city is reached.\nHappiness License Bureau\nAdvocated By Financier.\nDivorce licenses are advocated by Prof.\nJoseph F. Johnson, dean of the School of\nCommerce, New York university.\nProf. Johnson is a financier, and an au\nthority on banks. He looks at marriage as\na social contract. In his opinion, "It is not\nan" exaggeration to say that three-fourths\nof all human misery would pass away and\nbe forgotten if we could end our marriage\nobligations when love ceases."\nJust So and May Be.\nAnd perhaps, if we could license away\nall our other obligations, the remaining\none-fourth of all human misery would dis\nappear, and we should have a world with\nnothing but happiness in it.\nPlease, somebody, hurry up with that\nuniversal anti-misery license bureau.\n-o\nMany malefactors of great wealth will\nno doubt b,e surprised at learning the an\narchists\' favorite . newspaper - is the New\nYork Times. 1\nKing Peter of Serbia, in an interview,\ndidn\'t criticize the allies\' failure to give\nhim aid. That smoke on the horizon was\nthe allied fleet.\nThere are 20 miles of trenches to" every\nline of front, so that between Switzerland\nand the North Sea the British and French\narmies have at least 10,000 miles of\ntrenches to guard and keep in order.\nLet Germany Make\nthe Concessions.\n"It is about tifne the people began to\nshow appreciation of men while they are\nactually doing their work and that the\nnewspapers left off assailing them," said\nHenry Morgenthau, United States ambas\nsador to Turkey, who delivered a eulogy td\nPresident Wilson before the annual ban\nquet of the members of the American\nBankers\' Association.\nIt is unfortunately too true that men as\nindividuals and in the mass as a nation do\nnot show appreciation of public men dur\ning their hardest hours but wait until time\nhas given perspective.\ni Mr. Morgenthau referred of course to\nthe attacks which are constantly being\nmade, upon. the president from Republican\norgans or from those quarters where sen\nsation takes always precedence of fact.\nWhatever differences of view may be\nheld iat this time in regard to President\nWilson\'s policy, this is no time for attacks\nupon the president. And be it said to their\ncredit, some, of the president\'s bitterest po\nlitical enemies have been his fairest friends\nduring this great international crisis. And\nsome of his fairest friends in ordinary\ntimes have become his bitterest enemies,\nin this moment when he needs not so much\nthe support of the country as he does the\nspirit of fairness, the breadth of view which\nwhile differing, forbears to assail.\nThe-London Morning Post said, referr\ning to President Wilson\'s letter, to Senator\nStone, chairman of the senate foreign re\nlations committee: "It is the fate of Amer\nica, whether it will or not, to make a choice\nbetween her own gods and Germany\'s\nidols. President Wilson has sufficiently de\nfined the situation and in so doing he has\nearned the respect of the civilized worl"r."\nAnd in that one word, civilized, lies the\nexplanation of the stand the president has\ntaken. It is civilization that must be up\nheld. It is the spirit of today that refuses\nto go. back to the spirit of barbarism.\nOne backward step has already been\ntaken, when Germany scattered to the four\nwinds bits\' of paper which had once been a\ntreaty with Belgium. Shall America help\nGermany putv civilization still a step fur\nther backward, by relinquishing the just\nclaims of American citizens to sail the high\nseas? \'\nIt is not a question of whether Ameri\ncans should jeopardize the country. It is\nwhether Germany shall dictate to Ameri\ncan citizens contrary, to . international law\nobserved by all, other7 civilized countries.\nPresident Wilson does not: want Ameri\ncan citizens to place this .country in a .haz\nardous position. But that has "nothing to\ndo with, the, \'principle involved. ,\'\nPresident Wilson says in his letter to\nSenator Stone: "It is important to reflect\nthat if in this instance we allowed expedi\nency to take, the place of principle, the door\nwould inevitably be opened to still further\nconcessions."\nThe president -is" right "in believing that\nthe United States has" no concessions to\nmake. - Let Germany, not America, make\nthe concessions.\nMilk As. a Bracer;\nSubstitute for Booze.\nWar in Europe and prohibition\'s spread\nin this country has resulted in a combined\nboost for mild eved, gentle, cud chewing\n"bossy."\nFrance is finding milk an excellent sub\nstitute for absinthe which she discarded\nwhen hostilities started and our farmers in\nOregon, which recently went "dry," now\ncall for a "hot milk high-ball" instead of\napplejack.\nThe Pasteur Institute of Paris has just\nmade the declaration that milk is one of\nthe most powerful stimulants known. It\nhas been used liberally to stimulate the\nFrench soldiers before they go into battle\nand with such good results that the French\ngovernment now urges the sale of milk in\npreference to other soft drinks behind the\ntrenches when the men are off duty.\nIn Oregon the state dairymen\'s associa\ntion has started a campaign to popularize\nmilk as a substitute for booze.\n"Hot . milk is a better stimulant Jn case\nof chill and exhaustion than whiskey," an\nnounces the association in literature which\nit is putting out in hopes of turning idle\nbreweries into cowsheds.. .\nHereafter instead of going out with "the\nboys" dad can stay home and share baby\'s\nbedtime bottle.\nBilly Sunday\'s saving souls at, the rate of\n$2 per.

E. Call, at the\ncorner of Jackson and C streets,\nstating that someone had been shot,\nnear that vicinity, and it was believed\nhad been badly hurt. The chief and\nOfficer Herrington ini mediately went\nto the. scene, and after some consid\nerable searchinsr, discovered a negi-o\nnamed Hubbard, it is stated, suffering\nfrom a broken leg. The further de\nvelopment in the investigation led to\nthe. arrest of a negro named Ed.\nClopton, who was charged with dis\ncharging firearms in the city limits,\nand also with assaulting with a gun.\nClopton was not given the privilege\nof bail last night, the police deciding\nto,keephim in custody to await the\nresult of wounds which had been in\nflicted, according to witnesses, . by a\ngun which Clopton had. The negro\nunder arrest claimed that \'"he was\ncleaning the gun when it went off,"\nbut as the same negro some time since\nwas arrested for discharging firearms\nin the city limits, it was decided to\nfurther look into the trouble.\nLast night the negro, Clopton,\ncalled the turnkey to his cell and fur\nnished a list of witnesses to appear\nin his behalf at the recorder\'s court\nthis morning. Then he is alleged to\nhave made the statement that Hub\nbard was loading the gun, or had\nloaded it and was thought to have\nremoved the charge, when a number\nof negroes stood around. Shortly\nafterward, when Clopton had the gun\nin his hand, it was charged, it sud\ndenly went off accidentally, it is\nclaimed, and the charge tore through\nHubbard\'s leg. What the police did\nnot think looked just right was the\nfact that the "accident" was not re\nported to headquarters as in the ordi\nnary course of things, it should have\nbeen, and this will be a feature which\nwill be cleared up this morning, if\nthe case comes for hearing. Hub\nbard, the injured party, will not be\nable to appear in the case for some\ntime.\nESCAMBIA CO. CLUB\nTO MEET WEDNESDAY\nThe Escambia County Club will\nmeet on Wednesday night at 7 o\'clock,\nat the Owls hall, on East Intendencia\nstreet, and all members are urged to\nbe on hand.

Rob\ninson will defend himself against a\ncharge of .-rellin liquor without a\nlicense, and last night reports of three\nseparate sales are said to have boon\nrun down, with some measure of\nsuccess by the police department.\nOfficer Hall secured information\nearly yesterday that some one was\nselling drinks from a bottle, or was\nselling filled bottles, in the lower\nwestern part of the city. At several\npoints it was discovered some negroes\nwho had obtained supplies of liquor\nfrom some mysterious source, it. was\ntold, and at one house the officer\nfound a negro who is alleged to have\ninformed the police where he had got\nten the liquor he had been drinking.\nThat negro later faced Robinson and\nreiterated his statement.\nWhen Robinson was arrested he\nhad but little whiskey on him, two\nor more bottles which had been part\nly emptied, which the defendant\nclaimed to have consumed himself.\nThe case of selling without a license,\nhowever, was made against him, and\nhe had made no bond last night.\nIn trying to run down rather\nnumerous sources of supply of liquor\nyesterday, the greater part of the\nafternoon was spent by Chief Sanders\nand special officers. Unless if is\nproven that the man who supplied\nthe liquor is at present under arrest,\nthere is still, it is thought, a very\nliberal supply station somewhere in\nthe lower western part of the city,\nwhich the police have not yet discovered.\nWOMEN EMPLOYED IN\nPOSITIONS OF MEN\nCapetown, Feb. 27.
