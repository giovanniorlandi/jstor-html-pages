Cochran, . 500 South Peoria St.\n\' Editor, and Publisher. HpF398 TeL Monroe 353.\nVOL 2, NO. 224 Chicago, Friday, June 20, 1913\nONE CENT\nSOME HOPE FOR THOSE WHO FEAR WE ARE TO\nWIND UP IN A BLOODY REVOLUTION\nThe People Are Progressing Toward Brotherhood, and\n, the World Is Growing Better Some Significant ,\nSigns o the Times for Those Who Can See,\nBY N. D. COCHRAN\nI find that there is much talk among the so-called better class about\na bloody revolution in this country beside which the French revolution\nwould appear like a tea party.\nI have talked with rich men who actually believe it is coming, and that\nthe warjjetween capital and labor wDl be solved in no other way. I find\nthat many of them have been reading Carlye\'s History of the French Revo\nlution, and comparing present day indications with those that preceded that\nfamous upheaval.\nAnd I am convinced that if we ever do come to such a pass in human\nevents in this country it will be because of the ignorance of our financial\nand industrial kings.\nIt may be that my optimism saves me from the fears of the pessimists,)\nand then it may be that I am not looking for trouble, and can see the old\nworld getting better every minute. I am sure of one thing, however, and\nthat is there is no need for any such social catastrophe.\nIf democracy were losing ground I might feel some apprehension, but\nit isn\'t. On the contrary it is gaining everywhere on earth. There win be\nvTevolution, of course. "There had to be. But it has been on for years, and\nis gaining in strength and in accomplishments every day.\nAnd\' its greatest weapon is publicity. Just as fast as we get a free\npress we will get a free country. Every time the full light of publicity is\nturned on abuse and oppression, there is a movement to right existing\nwrongs.\nIn state after state, legislature after legislature, attempts have been\nmade to better conditions just as fast as the people became convinced that\ngonditioDB needed bettering; and I believe the .people everywhere MriR in-', 'slst on Justice Just as fast as they leanl what Justice is \'and where It -Is\nneeded.\nOnly a few years ago the outcry against kept Judges became general,\nand already a great change is noticeable in our courts a\' great change for\nthe better.\nOnly a few years ago the people got over the notion that the United\nStates senate was tfie-greatest deliberative body on earth, and began call\ning it a rich man\'s club. Look at the change. See how the people have\nhurled the mighty from their seats of power.\nAnd only last year, and right here in Chicago, we saw the tools of\nAldrich, Penrose7Crane and their ilk go tumbling into oblivion with the\nparty that had betrayed the people under their leadership.\nOnly a few years ago few people knew what the initiative and referen\ndum meant. Now it is becoming the law of the land.\nOnly a few years ago the demand started for the election of United\nStates senators by direct vote of the people. Now it is a part of the con\nstitution, the pressure of public opinion having forced a sufficient number\nof states to adopt the amendment\nFor years it seemed as if the real seat of government were in Wall\nstreet and only the scenery in Washington, but last year the people moved\nthe seat and the power from New York back to Washington. . .\nIn truly progressive and, democratic government the Eastern states are\nnow as zealous as their sisters on the Pacific slope.\nThere are new rules in the political game rules the Aldricb.es,\nBaileys, Smoots and Cannons don\'t understand.\nEven in the industrial field men are learning that the rules will have to .\nbe changed. A few years ago it would have been Impossible to have a com\nmittee from the United States Senate visit darkest West Virginia to Investi\ngate the feudal government of the coal barons. Today the glare search\nlight of publicity is being turned into the dark valleys among those hillsand\nmountains, and that means ultimately industrial health in place of indus\ntrial disease.\nThat same searchlight will go into the steel mills and Into the stock\nyards, as it has already gone Into the department stores and other places\nwhere human slavery exists and a few men climb to financial "success" on\nthe prostrate forms of their many brothers and sisters.\nAnd men can\'t stand the blinding-glare of publicity like that. Whether\nthey show it outwardly or not, I believe that the Rosenwalds, the Simpsons,\nBasches, Lehmanns, Hillmans and other merchant princes FEEL the\nburning.\nI do know that all over this country there are employers who made in\nquiry into wages after reading the testimony before the Illinois Welfare\nCommission, and raised the wages of women and girls without waiting for\na minimum wage law. We know of some here In Chicago who made an\nnouncement of the raise, but there are thousands who did it and kept quiet\nbecause they were ashamed of what they had been paying before.\nIt is that very thing that gives me hope and encouragement that men\nare ashamed. I think many have been unjust without knowing it, or with\nout being conscious of how much they were responsible for vice, crime and\npoverty. They were victims of a vicious system; and are only beginning to\nunderstand howjdcious the system had become.\nSo when I see that whenever they understand, people will try to work\ncloser to human brotherhood, I believe there must be constant Improvement\nof conditions and a steady movement of the mass toward human brother\nj-ittOi', 'SP5\np.\nhood and justice. And no bloody revolution is necessary so long as we are\nsteadily moving in the right direction.\nWe have had our political revolution. The industrial revolution is fol\nlowing closely on its heels. We are beginning to understand the Golden\nRule. When we understand it, there will be no man so mean but what we\nwill recognize in him a brother.\nOur present duty is not to educate the poor, but to educate the igno\nrant; and the ignorant employer is the one who most needs education. Our\n"most dangerous ignorance rides in automobiles and wears diamonds. Only\nless dangerous in ignorance are its immediate employes, those who think\nthey are not workingmen and believe they belong to a higher class because\nthey get.salaries instead of wages, and work for small pay rather than be\nlong to a trades union.\nPLANS OF BUILDINGAND CONSTRUCTION\nEMPLOYERS\' ASS\'N NOT GOING JUST RIGHT\nThe delightful plan of the Building\nand Construction Employers\' Asso\nciation to force 250 men to come to\nthem on their knees .by starving\n45,000 is not going as well as it\nmight.\nAnd the bosses are filled with\ngloom and reflection on that canny\nstatement of Robert Burns that\n"the\'hest laid plans o\' mice and men\naft gang agley."\nIn tb.e first- place, the Carpenters\nand Builders\' Association, the Mas\nter Plumbers\' Association and the\nMasons\', and Builders\' Association,\nall of which are supposed to be part\nof the Building and Construction\nEmployers\' Association, have notified\ntheir employes they won\'t take part\nin the lockout.\nSince the Carpenters\', Plumbers\'\nand -Masons\' Associations are the\nthree biggest connected with the\nbuilding and construction employers,\nthis puts some crimp in the lockout,\nright where a crimp will do the most\ngood.\nThe trouble is that George M. -Reynolds,\nihh Continental & Commercial\nbank building and the contractors\ntherefor got altogether too hasty in\ntheir decision to starve 50,000 men\nin order to make 250 be good dogs.\nThe employers are organized along\npractically the same lines as the\'\nyorkers, only much more tightly and\nmuch more secretly. Each trade has\nits employers\' organization ,and each\nemployers\' organization sends dele\ngates to the Building and Construc\ntion Employers\' Association, which is\nsupposed to represent the federated\ntrades.\nIn the present case, several of the\nemployers\' organization remark\ndarkly that the Building and Con\nstruction Employers\' Association\nMisrepresented the employers.\nThe Building and Construction\nEmployers\' Association has an execu\ntive committee, and the executive\ncommittee has a business agent.\nIt was the executive committee\nwhich decided to call the lockout, and\nit came to this decision without ever\nconsulting a single employer.\nWherefore there were a great\nmany employers vastly peeved when v\nE. M. Craig, the executive council\'s\nbusiness agent, served notice on\nthem that they must lock out their\nmen immediately.\nTheir peevishness was not lessenr\ned by the language in which the "or\nder" to lockout their men was couch\ned. After "ordering the lockout," the\ncommunication goes on: t\n"This rule (the one th"at all em\nployers must lock out their men) IS\nIMPERATIVE and applies to all\nmembers of the association who may\nbe employing any men in the trades\nnamed and equally applies to any job\nia&sn', 'such men may be working on in\nCook county.\n"Members are urged to give this\nmatter prompt attention and to com\nply with the request at once. MerrM\nbers who know of -any violation of\nthis order are requested to advise this\noffice at once. By order of the execu\ntive board:\n"C. W. Gindele, President.\n"E. M. Craig, Secretary."\nYou will notice the fine tone of\ncommand about this letter.\nYou also will notice, and it is to be\nhoped that the federal authorities\nlikewise will notice, the fine air of\nconspiracy about it\nNot the least iniquitous thing about\nthis order is the clause making every\nmember of the association a spy on\nevery other member.\nAs has been said, however, the or\nder is not working very well. And\nno less a person that E. M. Craig\nrealizes the same.\n"We notified 497 employers," said\nCraig gloomily, today," and only 215\nhave paid any \'attention. I don\'t\nknow what\'s the matter with the\nothers."\nHe stared gloomily ahead of him\nfor a moment, and then remembered\nhe had been talking Jo newspaper\nmen.\n"But don\'t publish that, you\nknow,!\' he said hastily.\nThe reporters representing the\ntrust newspapers promised, just as\nhastily, that they would not.\n"Now I\'ll tell you what to pub\nlish," Craig continued. "You explain\nthat we employers are not acting\ncruelly in this lockout We wouldn\'t\ndo anything like that\n"And you know, the Building\nTrades Council is awful cruel. Why,\nI could tell you about cruel things\ntney nave done mat would snock you\nterribly."\n"Tell us some," suggested a re\nporter. "Well," said Craig, his eyes be\ncoming misty, "take what barmend a\nyear ago. It Was- the time the Chil-\ndren\'s Memorial Hospital was beln\nbuilt, and the poor little sick children\nwere dying while they waited for it.\n"And do you know what these\nrhorrid working men did?" asked\nCraig in an awed voice.\n"No," chorussed the reporters.\n"They they called a strike on the "\nbuilding," sobbed Craig.\n"And they kept the strike up for\nfour months," continued Craig,\nstruggling with his sobs. "And the\npo-or little children dying all over\nChicago because there wasn t any\nhospital to take them to. And the\nBuilding Trades Council acted so\nhard-hearted about it, just like a lot\noffends.\n"Miss Bena M. Henderson, she\'s\nthe superintendent of the Children\'s \'.\nHospital, called them up over and \'\nover again, and just begged them\nto come back and finish the work on\nthe hospital for the sake of the dear\nlittle children. She went to see these\nrough men, and almost went down\non her knees to them. But it w-was\nn-no g-good. They w-w-would liot\n1-1-listen."\nMr. Craig broke down completely\nand wept into a fine cambric hand\nkerchief. A Day Book reporter callgd up Miss\nHenderson at the Children\'s Me\nmorial Hospital and asked about the\ncruel conduct of the Building Trades\nCouncil, telling her what the weeping\nMr. Craig had said.\n"Rot," said Miss Henderson, and\nthen: "Excuse me, but there was\nnothing of that sort at all. The men\nwent on strike, of course. It was at\na time when the building was com- ,\npleted, only some inside work was\nleft to be done. I don\'t know any\nthing about the rights or the wrongs\nof the men\'s argument with their\nemployers. It was nothing to me, for"\nthere was more than enough room\nfor all the children we had on our\nhands in other places. I never asked\n.the Building Trades Council to com\nplete the work for the jiake qf tnj\nchildren. That is nonsense?\'\n1\n- n&&ttot&u M', 'SBSIpSBpjlHRS\nWhen Simon O\'Donnell, president\nof the Building Trades Council, heard\nabout Craig\'s attack of sobs, he\nsmiled grimly.\n"If you want to hear a hospital\nstory, I\'ll tell you one," he volun\nteered. "Shoot!" said the reporter.\n"I understand that the employers\nhave locked out all of our men on the\nnew County Hospital. That\'s a fine\npiece of business, isn\'t it?\nv "Two weeks ago we had every rea\n"pSon to call a strike on the new hos\npital. The officers of the Building\n" Trades Council made a few inquiries\nand found that for every day the\nwork on the hospital was held back,\nthe lives of a dozen were endangered.\n"We called no strike, despite the\njustice of our demands, because of\nthe sick and dying who. needed to\nbe cared for.\n"Now the employers have locked\nout the men on the new hospital, and\nby so doing are locking out the sick\nand the dying among Chicago\'s poor.\nFine business, isn\'t it? Mr. Craig\nmight spare a few tears to shed for\nthe people who die because they\ncan\'t get into Cook County\'s Hos\npital." The lockout, in its present extent,\nprobably will affect about 15,000 men\ndirectly, and another 20,000 indirect\nly; men like the teamsters. But at\npresent it has not affected anything\nlike 15,000 directly. No census of\nthe men affected has been made yet,\nbut the number locked out probably\nis in the neighborhood of five or six\nthousand.\nThe Building Trades Council meets\ntonight, and plans may be laid for\nthe future.\n"We -don\'t need any elaborate\nplanning," said O\'Donnell, today.\n"We\'re not bothered about the situa\ntion. If the fool employers who\nobeyed the orders of the executive\ncouncil of the bosses\' federation\' of\nbosses think they can stand it better\nthan we can, they\'re welcome to find\nWt by trying,."\nCHICAGO BRIEFS\nMiss Lizzie Silverman, young\ndressmaker who took bichloride of\nmercury tablets in mistake for head\nache vmedicine, tried to escape from\nher bed in University hospital today.\nUnable to stand.

THE SOLE SURVIVOR\nBy Walter James Delaney.\nCoward! How that word rankled\nwithin the soul of Ralph Warden,\nand v what a difference its utterance\nhad made in his life! Looking back\nsix months, it seemed to him as\nthough that word had been the start\nof all his troubles, the evil star of\nhis destiny.\nHe had lived at Junta, a frontier\ntown and a military post, since boy-\nMade Out a Horseman in the Dis\ntance. lood. Just as he came of age his\nmother had died. Through her brief\n"period of illness it had been the\n\'.friendly visits and kind ministrations\nof Ethel Lynd that had made her se\nrene and peaceful. Ralph had grown\n"to love the beautiful daughter of Col\n\'onel Lynd. He had fancied that she\nsomewhat encouraged him, when a\nrude circumstance had brought down\n\'into ruins all his .fair air castles of\nhope.\nHe recalled the day when Miss\nLynd, "her girl cousin, Lieutenanr\nVanderloot and three visiting schoo\'\nfriends of Ethel were strolling near\nthe river, when a homeless drunkard\nknown about the district as Pauper\nJoe, reeled across their path. He\nchanced to joggle against Ralph. In\nhis maudlin fury called him a name\nthat was always wiped out with\nblood in that primitive section, and\nstruck him.\nFor a moment the fire of resent\nment and indignation sprang to the\neyes of Ralph. Then, clinching his\nfists, holding his breath, his face\ngrew ashen as he stood rigid as a\nstatute.\nHe fancied he noted a look of\ncontempt cross the face of Miss\nLynd. He heard a word spoken\n"Coward!"\nThen the group passed on, but not\nuntil Lieutenant Vanderloot had\nstepped forward, vaunting his chival\nrous strength in some sneer at\nRalph, and with a cruel blow sent\nthe poor wretch, Pauper Joe, to the\nground. \'\nIt might have been over-sensitiveness,\nbut Ralph fancied that Ethel\nand her friends purposely hurried on.\nHe lingered. The same influence that\nhad held his hand back from resent\ning an insult, now drove him to the\nexercise of a further humanity. It\nwas he who lifted the stranded wreck\nto his feet, led him to a lodging\nhouse, and left enough money with\nits proprietor to care for\'his pension\ner till he recovered from the effects\nof drink and injury.\nTwo days later Ethel left Junta,\nand Ralph had not met her in the\nmeantime. Ethel was going on a long\nvisit to a distant point where her\nfather was making his annual round\nof the military posts?\n"I kept my promise," eaid Ralph to\nhimself staunchly, as he thought of\nthe blight that had come over his\nfair love dreams. "I have lost Ethel,\nthe story of that blow has got around\ntown, and some think me a mean.\nI.... ti Ifc;\n"', 'jwiJ?pNiiwi\'iPWJwiip\nspirited craven; but I promised moth\ner, and I have kept my word!"\nIt was on her death bed that Mrs.\nWarden had drawn her Bon to the\nsacred pledge regarding two things\ndrink and fighting. Her own father\nhad been a victim to the wine cup.\nRalph\'s dead father had suffered\ndeath in a hot border fight brought\nabout by a mere trifling remark.\nMrs. Warden had died with a satis\nfied smile, when her loyal son had\npromised . never to raise his hand\nagainst another in temper or hate.\nAnd the whirling of time had gone\non, Ralph had drifted .to another\ntown. He was not very successful in\n\'getting work. One day a sudden reso\nlution came into his mind; he would\njdin the regular army. Thus it was\nthat one year after this last sight of\nthe only woman he had ever loved,\nhe was a sergeant at Fort Danger,\nunder the orders of the man he had\nconsidered a rival a rival no longer,\nhowever.\n"I wronged you once, Warden,"\nadmitted the lieutenant voluntarily\nthe day Ralph came to the fort "I\nthought you a poltroon, and said bo.\nLater it leaked out to all of us about\nyour sacred promise to your mother.\nI respect you for it I think: that dis\ncovery made pretty MIsb Lynd edge\naway from me.

She\ninformed the officer in charge\nTwenty minutes later there dashed\ninto the fort a reeking horse. In the\nsaddle was a man, tattered sun\nblistered, with a gaping wound in\none arm, and propped up in front\nof him another man, seemingly dy\ning. The rider was Ralph Warden, his\nhelpless burden Pauper Joe. The\nhorse reeled and fell to its knees.\nThe rider toppled in a dead faint\nlntOxthe arms of two Boldiers. They\nlifted Pauper Joe gently to the\nground.\n"Water, for the love of heaven!"\nhe- pleaded, Then, with the cooling\ndraught had passed his efvered lips:\n"Care for him, the sergeant the\nhero! I must tell the story quick, for\nI\'m done for."\nWhat a story it was! Fort Danger,\nsurrounded hy Indians, cut off from\ncivilization, with only a week\'s sup\nplies, was hemmed in. Most of the\nsoldiers, desperate, mad for fight,\nhad got at the liquor stores.

And r"was very\nmuch surprised.\nI used to believe that all men who were sent to the penitentiary came\nfrom it with only one desire revenge on the Christian society which had\ncondemned them to a living death.\nI believed, this chiefly because I knew something of penitentiaries.\nYears ago I spent several weeks visiting the warden of California\'s gloomy,\nsea and hfll-bound place of horror at San Quentin.\nAnd what I saw and heard there made a very deep impression on my\nmind, so that I felt that I should never be able to forgive society if J. were\nsent there, no matter how justly.\nI continued to believe that this must be true of an men, until at last I\ncame to know there are men who\nmake mistakes and pay the cruel\npenalty, and are only withered and\nnot embittered under that penalty.\nBut still I believed that he who un\njustly served a term in the peniten\ntiary could only find relief in re\nvenge. I know better now.\nAn ex-convict came to the office.\nHe had been sent up for thirty-five\nyears for murder. He said he was\nsentenced unjustly and that his trial\nwas a mockery.\nSo I went to him, not quite know\ning what to expect. But I think I ex\npected an old and bitter, man, whose\neyes would hide shiftily their slum\nbering hatred and whose tongue\nwould be exceedingly venomous.\nAnd I found instead this gentle\nspoken, erect old man, with the.\nsteady, blue eyes and the unafraid\nair.\n"It was a Chicago case," he said,\nwhen I asked him for the details.\n"My name is George Stone. I killed\na negro named Nelson in the Turner\nHotel at Thirty-first and Wabash\navenue, in June, 1893, during the\nWorld\'s Fair.\n, "They called it murder, and I was\nfound guilty and given thirty-five\nyears, and if I hadn\'t had friends I\'d\nbe in Joliet yet. But I did have\nfriends, and my sentence was com-\n-puted to eighteen years py Gov,\nDeneen, and that let me out in ten\nyears and three months, when my\ngood behavior time was taken out. I\nwas released from Joliet last Mon\nday. "It wasn\'t murder at all. I did not\nget a square deal. I do not think I\nshould have been in Joliet even ten\nyears. I think I should have been\nacquitted.\n"The killing happened this way. I\nwas second cook at the Turner Hotel.\nNelson, the negro, was first cook.\nWe got along like brothers for six\nor seven weeks.\n"Then one day he accused me of\nsomething I did not do. I told him he\nwas mistaken. He called me aiar.\nI don\'t allow any man to call me a\nliar, especially a negro. I told him he\nlied, and he called me a white-\n"Then he seemed to fly into a mad,\nunreasoning rage. He ran to a little\nside room off the kitchen, where the\ncarving knives, were kept in a stand\nagainst the walL He seized a carving\nknife. He came for me.\n"He chased me around the kitchen\ntwice. Then I made for where my\ncoat was hanging, and just before, I\nreached it I dropped to my hands and\nknees in front of him. He went\nsprawling over me. I reached up to\nmy coat and drew my pistol.\nI\ntKSSttjmT\n\'?"\nHM', 'iP!\n\'\'"JS\'SSC"\'\'\'\'1 -S!\'TWlfiP"-\'f!JK\'r TFyVsr \'?\n"Their I ran for the stairs.

I turned and fired at\nhim three times. He tumbled back\ndown the stairs.\n"I ran from the hotel, coatless, my\nshirt sleeves rolled up, my revolver\nstill in my hand. I hid that night in\nan old shack by the railroad tracks,\nand the next day I went down to the\nFair Grounds, and no one molested\nme.\n"But I knew that the police would\ncome after me, so the next morning\nI traded my revolver for an old coat.\nI told the man with whom I made the\ntrade that I had been drunk the night\nbefore and had lost my coat, and that\nI couldn\'t go to work without one.\n"That night I beat my way on a\ntrain far into Indiana, and there I\nworked as a farmhand for three\nweeks. But the work did not suit\nme, besides I felt that I was too near\nChicago.\n"I beat my way back to Pullman,\nand from Pullman to St. Louis,\nWhere I saw my wife for the first\ntime in many months. I told her I\nwas going on to Texas immediately.\nIt was not safe for me to stay in St\ns Louis. Too many people knew me\nthere.\n"I beat my way to Port Worth,\nTex., and worked at odd jobs there\nfor a time. Then I went to Weimar\nTex., and got a steady Job as a yard\nman on the S. P. R, R. I was well\nliked; I drew good money; I was re\nspected. "My wife never wrote me. Through\na. woman friend of her\'s I heard she\nwas in San Antone. I wrote her and\ntold her to join me. She did, and we\nlived together at Weimar.\n"We were very happy for some\ntime. It was at Weimar our first\nchild was born. Did I say our first?\nI should have Bald our only child!\nOur only child "in -eighteen years of\nmarried life! Think of that!\n"He was a boy. He must be a\nbig, strapping boy now see, here is\nhis picture! It is eleven years since\nI saw him.\n"Well, we were happy, and I saved\nmoney until at last I had enough to\ntake my wife home to England. I\nthought she would enjoy the trip.\nI thought it would make her hap\npier. And I wanted my boy to see\nthe country his father came from.\n"So we went over, and it was my\nundoing. My wife told Scotland Yard\nI was wanted for murder In Chicago,\nand men from Chicago came over\nand got me.\n"My trial was a farce; they suborn\ned witnesses; they lied; they were\ndetermined to send me over. Do you\never read the Bible? Well, it was\nsomething like the trial of Jesus\nChrist, only they never brought it\nhome to Him with all their perjuries;\nand they did bring it home to me.\n"You see, they had gone a long\nway to get me over to England\nand I suppose it had them a lot of\nmoney and they weren\'t going to\nhave me acquitted after that.\n"So I got thirty-five years."\n"Murphy was warden when you\nfirst went to Joliet, wasn\'t he?" I\nasked.\n"Yes," he said.\n"What do you think of him?" I\nasked, and I thought this -would\nbring out the gall, for I knew how\nMurphy had been hated by the con-1\nvicts he tyrranized.\nThe ex-convict hideous name to\ncall anyone, isn\'t it? passed his\nhand wearily before his forehead. ;\n"Oh, Murphy," he said, gently;\n"Murphy was not a good man. He\nhe grafted. He made ten cents off\nevery prisoner daily and there are\nbetween fifteen and sixteen hundred\nin Joliet.\n\'Murphy was not a good man. He\nwbb well, the best way of explain-\ning -what Murphy was is by telling .\nyou that in the whole ten years J\njggtmtmmmM', 'was there, I only saw him in the\nyard twice. -v\n"He was afraid to come out in the\nyard; afraid to come near the men\nhe cheated and- rohbed and punished\nso cruelly. He was afraid that some\none of them, grown desperate, would\nkill him. That was how corroded\nWarden Murphy\'s conscience was."\n"And Allen, the new warden?" 1\nasked.\nThe old man\'s face lit up with\nsome inward fire.\n"He\'s a man," he said. "He\'s a\ngreat man. He\'s out in the yard\nevery day, talking with the convicts,\nasking them if they are fixed all\nright, asking for complaints. And he\nlets them play baseball, too. Allen-\nis a man. And there isn\'t a convict\nin the penitentiary who would harm\na hair of his head."\n"Tell me more about how the peni\ntentiary was run under Murphy," I\nsuggested.\nBut the old man waved me aside.\n"Murphy," he said, "was not a\ngood man. What does it matter now?\nIt is over; there is another man in\nhis place; a man "with a heart in his\nbreast, and the courage to let his\nheart speak. Why should we talk of\nMurphy?\n"I just came here to tell you about\nmy case. I didn\'t get a square deal.\nEveryone who knows me knows that 1\nI did not They all know that I al\nways was honest and decent. I never\nwas a coward.\n"Look!"\nHe pulled a long envelope from\nhis pocket, and from it drew great\nbundles of testimonials.\nThere was his honorable discharge\nfrom the Buffs, that famous fighting\nfoot regiment of Britain, after ten\nyears of service in India; there was\nhis honorable discharge from the\nMetropolitan police of the City of\nLondon, after two years as a con\nstable; there were letters from the\ncolonel of the Buffs, from the cap\ntain of his company, from the lieu-\ntenant of his squad; there were\nscores of letters from Fort Worth and\nWeimar, telling how well and hon\nestly Stone, although under the\nalias of Tandy, had lived in those\nyears of hiding.\nAnd there was one letter from\nWeimar which told how George Tan\ndy had captured a negro who mur\ndered the town constable of Weimar.\n"That was this way," explained\nStone, when I pressed him. "I was\nin the yards one day, when I saw\nthe constable coming down the\ntracks with a negro whom I knew\nwas wanted for disturbing the peace.\nThe negro formerly had worked for\nthe constable. Little did the con- .\nstable think what was to happen.\n"They were near enough for me\nto see them clearly. I saw the-ne-\ngro\'s hand steal back to his hip\npocket The constable paid no atten\ntion; he trusted his old servant. The\nnegro\'s hand whipped to the front\nagain; there was a puff of smoke, the\ncrash of a forty-five and the con\nstable crumpled up on the tracks.\n"I took after the negro. I was not\narmed and he still had many bullets\nin his Colt\'s. I chased him into a\nsorghum patch. Other people had\njoined in the chase now. Many of\nthem had rifles and revolvers. We\nsurrounded three sides of the sor\nghum patch and were closing in on\nthe fourth, when the negro broke\nand ran. \'\n"Those people must have fired\neighty shots at the negro. Not one\nstruck, him. \'Here, give me that\nrifle,\' I cried to one man. \'I won\'t\ngive you the rifle,\' he said. \'But you\ncan have my revolver.\' \'\n"There was only two bullets in\nthe revolver. I took after the negro\nand came up on him fast The others\nwere afraid to close in on him. They\nknew he had at least four shots left\nin his big Colt\'s.\n"Well, I rounded him up in a patch\nof weeds, and he emptied his revol\nver at me, and I mine at him.

"I\ndidn\'t get a fair trial. It was just a\nmockery. I didn\'t get a square deal."\nIt is curious how a man can suf\nfer under a great wrong for many\nyears and at the end of the time be\nmore concerned over his good name\nthan desirous of revenge for the\nwrong done him.\no o\nLITTLE HOPE FOR SUFFRAGIST\nWHO GRABBED RACE HORSE\nLondon, June 20.In the little cot\ntage hospital at Ascot physicians are\nmaking a big effort to save the life of\nthe Cambridge student, Harold Hew\nitt, who tried to stop the Gold Cup\nat Ascot as Emily Davison did the\nDerby at Epsom Downs, but they\nbelieve he has small chance of re\ncovery.

The second\nwas exclusively for ladies.\nAt the first session the reporters\nheard first hand, or first ear, every\nthing that was said. They were in\nthe dark as to what had been ac\ncomplished. They didn\'t hear what was said at\nthe second meeting, but they learned\nwhat had been accomplished. Sure,\nthe meeting adjourned until next\nTuesday night to meet at the Audi\ntorium Hotel, and men reporters will\nnot be allowed.\nProm 8 o\'clock until 11:30 a hand\nful of jurors and a roomful of audi\ntors sweltered. They might have\nsweltered for a few hours more, but\na Teporter for a morning paper told\nthe doorkeeper it was almost time\nfor him to write his story, so the\nladies hastened to adjourn the meet\ning and then tell everything that had\nbeen done in secret.\nBetween the time the meeting\nopened and when the reporters were\nexiled to the roof garden there was\nplenty of entertainment. It was su\nperior to the cabaret on the roof.\nMrs. Minona S. Jones, who plays\non the team and umpires at the same\ntime, tried to start a discussion of\nsuffrage; Mrs. P. H. Greene, vice\nchairman of the council, sat on Mrs.\nJones; Mrs. Lillian Holmes apologiz\ned for a false accusation she had\nmade against Judge Pinckney, and a\nmere man, who wanted to know if\nthe council was "after the truth,"\nwas told he was out of order.\nTher was trouble starting the\nmeeting, because Judge and Juror\nJones had lost the minutes of the last\nmeeting, the names of witnesses, and\n4 Ut of the jurors.\n"We ought to have dress rehear\nsals of these here meetings," said\nJ. and J. Jones. "There\'s so many\neyes and ears around."\nSome of the ladies felt of their\nbelts and hair, thinking Tprs. Jones\nmight be talking about their appear\nance. Then Dr. Lillian Thompson, who\nacted , as questioner because Mrs.\nJones\' husband was sitting on a ledge\noutside the window and could not get\nclose enough to his wife to tell her\nwhat to say, opened the meeting by\nreading a statement of the aims of\nthe council.\nJudge Cooper, who has been the\nchief target for the investigation, \'\nwas given a rest and it was plain\nthat the council had been advised\nto hedge a little in its attacks. Dr,\nThompson admitted there might be\nsomething wrong with the laws and\nthat the judge wasn\'t entirely to\nblame.\nAfter this Mrs. Jones started her\nsuffrage stunt.\n"The women should refuse to cele\nbrate Independence Day," she cried.\n"They have never been free until\nthis week. I think we ought to have\na day of our own. The men have\nnever "\nMrs. Greene, bristled to her feet\nand interrupted the boss.\n"I have been with you all the\ntime. Now you\'re in wrong.

My dear, I was fight\ning for suffrage before you were\nborn."\n"I believe you, dearie," answered\n.Mrs. Rutherford, undecided whether', 'to be pleased or cattish at what Mrs.\nGreene had said.\nWith this fine start, Mrs. Green\ngrabbed the leadership from Mrs.\nJones and ran the meeting:\nMrs. Pearl Whiting, whose daugh\nter was attacked in a photograph\ngallery at the North Shore beach,\nwas on the stand. She said two men\nhad been convicted of the attack be\nfore Judge Cooper, but he had grant\ned them a \'new trial.\n"Gave them a new trial!" shouted\nMrs. Greene. "I never heard of such\na thing. Didn\'t those twelve men\nknow more than Judge Cooper. If\nthey believed the men on trial were\nguilty the men should have been pun\nished. What did you think of the\nreversal by Judge Cooper?41\nBefore Mrs. Watling could answer\nsome one a man explained to\nMrs. Greene that a reversal was one\nthing and a new trial was something\nelse again.\n"Oh, no; they\'re the same thing,"\nanswered Mrs. Jones, who didn\'t like\nto see Vice Chairman Greene grab\ntoo much of the spotlight.\n"What do you thing of that?" de\nmanded Mrs. Greene of Assistant\nState\'s Attorney John Fleming, who\nlooked like he would rather be sohie\nwhere else than in the hot room\n"In every conviction a motion for\na pew trial is made as a matter of\ncourse and then it is argued before\ntbje judge," answer Fleming. "If he\nthinks an error of law has been\nmade, or the evidence is defective,\nhe grants a new trial as a matter of\nright to the accused. In this case\nthe judge said there was not enough\ncorroboration of the girl\'s charge."\n"Not enough corroboration," ex\nploded Mr. Jones, turning to Mrs.\nWatling. "Didn\'t a physician testify\nat the trial."\n"Yes," replied the witness. "He\nsaid my little girl hadn\'t been hurt"\nMrs. Jones looked crestfallen.\nThen came the "evldenca" in the\ncase -ajjainfjt Judge Cooper, wherein\nfiavlcl Chilateiisoa "was pa trlaL\ncharged with an attack on a little!\ngirl" The council claims the Judge\nwouldn\'t let Assistant State\'s Attor\nney Hinckley question the little girl.\nHinckley said that when he asked\na direct question about the attack the\ndefense objected and Judge Cooper\nsustained it According to Hinckley,\nthe Judge said the question was lead\ning and called for a conclusion.\nTherefore, there was nothing for him\nto do but object\nAnother terrible charge against\nthe judge, who, according to the\nladles roasting him, wasn\'t being per\nsonally attacked, went up in smoke.\nWhen Mrs. Cross, whose daughter\nwas attacked in her home, 3724\nLangley avenue, was called by Judge\nJones, she did not answer.\nInstead, J.
