        <pre>["“Libya has embarked on a more moderate course both domestically and in its foreign rela\xad\ntions. The changes, however, do not reflect a new spirit of reform because the fundamental \nprinciples on which the state is built have not changed significantly. ”\nNew Thinking in Libya\nB y  M a r y -J a n e  D eeb\nAssociate Professor of Government, American University\nT\nh e  socialist world faced rapid political and \neconomic change in 1989 and witnessed the \ndeath of some of its leaders. The socialist \nnations of North Africa did not remain immune to \nthe transformations occurring elsewhere but in\xad\ntroduced change more slowly. Libya has chosen to \nretain its political structure and ideological frame of \nreference to permit only domestic economic re\xad\nforms, which were undertaken in conjunction with \na new course in foreign policy more in line with that \nof most Arab states.\nDomestically, the changes represented an at\xad\ntempt by the Libyan leadership to remain in power \nby preempting an outpouring of popular resent\xad\nment and forestalling the type of major upheaval \nthat shook Algeria in October, 1988. Changes were \nalso a result of the falling oil prices on the world \nmarket and the inability of the Libyan government \nto meet its payments on a number of development \nprojects, imports of basic goods and arms pur\xad\nchases. Isolated regionally after the breakup of the \nArab African Federation with Morocco in August, \n1986, Libya’s strongman Muammar Qaddafi had \nto find a way to rejoin the ranks of the Arab states. \nSupport from the Arab world was essential to \nstrengthen the Libyan leader’s position at home. \nThe price for reconciliation, however, involved \nsignificant changes in foreign policy, a price Qad\xad\ndafi was willing to pay.\nInternationally, the world was changing rapidly \nand Qaddafi was quick to understand the implica\xad\ntions of those changes for Libya and to redirect its \nforeign policy accordingly. The inability or unwill\xad\ningness of the Soviet Union to protect Libya from \nthe United States raid of April, 1986, made it clear \nto the Libyan leadership that it could not rely on the \nSoviet Union for its national security. Diversifying \nand modernizing Libya’s arsenal while pursuing \nbetter relations with the United States and with the \nWest in general was the course Qaddafi chose.\n'See Mary-Jane Deeb, “Libya’s Economic Development \n1961-1986: Social and Political Implications,” The Maghreb \nReview, vol. 12, nos. 1-2 (January-April, 1987).\n2Keesing’s Contemporary Archives (hereafter, KCA), vol. 33, no. 6 \n(June, 1987), p. 35220.\n3Ibid., p. 35219.\nThis author has argued elsewhere that political \nimperatives have always been the determining fac\xad\ntors behind the economic changes that have taken \nplace in Libya since Qaddafi came to power.1 It \ncomes as no surprise, therefore, that the recent at\xad\ntempts to foster economic growth by encouraging \nthe private sector to play a more active role in the \neconomy are at least partly the result of political \npressure.\nA decade of radical socialist policies and deter\xad\niorating trade relations with the major Western \npowers, followed by a period of declining oil \nrevenues, created major economic problems in \nLibya and serious dissatisfaction with the regime. The \nGeneral People’s Congress (the GPC) that has often \nbeen little more than a rubber stamp for govern\xad\nment policies met for its twelfth annual meeting be\xad\ntween February 25 and March 2, 1987, to discuss \nthe state of the economy. It expressed popular griev\xad\nances and demanded basic reforms including the \ndirect sale of farm products to the consumer by \nfarmers themselves, because state companies were \ninefficient in distributing food products; the diversi\xad\nfication of investments; and the publication of con\xad\nsolidated bank accounts. The congress also de\xad\nmanded greater availability of medicines and spare \nparts and the regular payment of salaries.2\nThe significance of this meeting lies in the fact \nthat the GPC, the defender of socialist ideals in the \nLibyan Jamahiriya (“a state run by the people \nwithout a government,” according to Qaddafi), was \ncriticizing state institutions and proposing changes. \nThe proposals reveal the extent of popular frustra\xad\ntion with the Libyan economic situation.\nIslamic fundamentalist groups like al-Takfir wal- \nHijra (Charge of Infidelity and Migration), \nal-Dawa wa al-Jihad (the Call and the Holy War), \nand the Tabligh (the Announcement) were attract\xad\ning the discontented in urban centers, high schools \nand universities. In October, 1986, seven alleged \nmembers of the Hezbullah (the Party of God) had \nconfessed on television to the murder of a member \nof a revolutionary committee who had tried to pre\xad\nvent them from trading privately in agricultural \nproduce.3 The government had cracked down on\n149\n", '150 •  CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1990\nthese groups, but it was difficult to erase their ap\xad\npeal to the disgruntled population.4\nLibyans were also unhappy with the policy of \nforced conscription in an army that had suffered a \nhumiliating defeat and a high number of casualties \nagainst Chadian forces in the early months of 1987. \nOpposition to the Libyan regime came from within \nthe army as well as outside it. Defection of fighter \nplane and helicopter crews were frequent during \nearly 1987, and injanuary of that year Colonel Hu\xad\nsain Said al-Kadiki, the head of air defense opera\xad\ntions, was shot at military headquarters after dis\xad\nagreeing over the use of Libyan forces to defend Ira\xad\nnian cities.5\nOpposition to Qaddafi was becoming more or\xad\nganized outside Libya as well. In Cairo, in \nJanuary, 1987, seven exiled Libyan opposition \ngroups agreed to form a joint working group to con\xad\ntinue exposing the Qaddafi regime’s human rights \nviolations and to pursue a course aimed at over\xad\nthrowing the regime. These groups included the \nLibyan National Salvation Front, the Libyan Na\xad\ntional Struggle Movement, the Libyan National \nDemocratic Front and the Libyan National \nOrganization.\nECONOMIC CHANGE: A SAFETY VALVE\nQaddafi’s response to these pressures was to un\xad\ndertake economic reforms while keeping the lid on \nthe opposition. On March 26, 1987, he appeared on \nnational television and discussed his new program. \nHe first tackled the issue of agriculture, attributing \nthe failure of that sector of the economy to man\xad\npower shortages in rural areas; he suggested that \nfamilies employ outside help and share the profits \nfrom the land. Whereas hiring farmworkers re\xad\nmained illegal, Libyan farmers could now employ \nothers on a profit-sharing basis that was aimed at \nreducing labor shortages in rural areas.6\nThe next two years saw very few changes in the \nagricultural sector. The basic reform was in the \nmarketing of agricultural produce, which became \nthe farmer’s responsibility rather than the state’s.7 \nLand ownership remained based on the principle of \nusufructuary: “Libyan soil is the property of all Lib\xad\n*See Mary-Jane Deeb, “Libya,” in Stuart Mews, ed., Religion \nin Politics: A World Guide (London: Longman, 1989).\n$KCA, vol. 33, no. 6 (June, 1987), p. 35219.\n6Tripoli Television Service, March 26, 1987, in Foreign \nBroadcast Information Service, Near East Service (hereafter, \nFBIS), March 27, 1987, p.

His solution was to turn factories \nover to the workers and make them responsible for \nthe production of goods and for every other aspect \nof the manufacturing process.8 In August, 1988, the \nGeneral People’s Secretariat for Industry an\xad\nnounced the transfer of 73 large factories from the \nstate to the workers.\nThe reforms in that sector, however, were less \ndramatic than they first appeared to be. Light in\xad\ndustries were to be turned over to the private sector, \nwhile heavy industry was to remain in the hands of \nthe state. The transfer could be made only to the \nworkers actually employed in those factories. There \nwas to be no entrepreneurial businessman engaged \nin the process of developing or expanding those in\xad\ndustries. With all its qualifications, this transfer was \nnot very different from Qaddafi’s 1978 reforms, \nwhen he had urged workers to take factories and \nother enterprises from their owners, and become \n“partners, not wage laborers.”9\nChanges were perhaps more substantive in the \nthird sector of the economy — trade. Qaddafi admit\xad\nted in his March, 1987, speech, that state institu\xad\ntions had been slow and inefficient in distributing \ngoods and commodities to the Libyan population. \nHe even lauded the black market activities of those \nwho tried to find a way to make up for the shortages \nin the domestic market. He suggested that the pri\xad\nvate sector should be allowed to distribute the \ngoods, while the state should remain in control of \nforeign trade.10\nIn practice, that meant allowing the private sec\xad\ntor to open stores to sell those goods, instead of \ndistributing them to state cooperatives. Starting in \nmid-1988, Libyan, Tunisian and Western goods \ncould be found in well-stocked stores in Tripoli and \nBenghazi and in smaller towns and villages. In con\xad\ntrast to an earlier era when merchants and trades\xad\nmen were described as parasites, the GPC was \nmaking statements to the effect that Libyans had \nthe right to choose their own employment, in\xad\ncluding trading.\nLibyans, however, had to prove that the shops \nwere theirs and that they had not obtained their \ncapital illegally. Not everyone was to be allowed to \ntrade. “Let the elderly, the pensioners, physically \nhandicapped and widows, and divorced women; \nthose who are . . .  on social security; let them \nengage in trade.”11 Those who had previously been \nbusinessmen or shopkeepers were forbidden to \nreturn to their original occupation.\nQaddafi’s statements with regard to private prop\xad\nerty evoke a bureaucratic nightmare. In a speech on\n', 'New Thinking in Libya • 151\nJanuary 9, 1989, he admitted that he had received \nmany requests to return property confiscated by the \nstate.12 He argued that property would be returned \nonly if it could be proved that it had originally been \nacquired without “exploiting” others. Furthermore, \nit had to be legalized through a newly created \nDepartment of Socialist Authentication that \ndecided whether claims on land or property were \nlegitimate. That department apparently did not \nrecognize Ottoman or Italian notarization of prop\xad\nerty documents, nor would it accept the confirma\xad\ntion of witnesses. “No reasons, documents . . . will \nbe sufficient to confirm or notarize a property for its \nlegal owner.”13 Qaddafi did not specify what re\xad\nquirements were needed to prove ownership; yet he \nthreatened claimants with eviction from their \nhomes if they did not find a way of proving their \nownership and registering their property.\nThese new economic policies were intended to \nact as a safety valve, giving Libyans more freedom \nto trade and to acquire a greater variety of goods. \nThe policies were not meant to change the system or \nto deviate too far from the path of Libyan socialism. \nQaddafi was reluctant to allow the private sector \ngreater economic freedom, fearing that, in the long \nrun, it would lead to demands for more political \nfreedom.\nCHANGE AND CONTINUITY IN POLITICS\nQaddafi appeared to be making changes in the \npolitical sphere as well; thus in March, 1988, he \nbegan freeing an estimated 400 political prisoners \nfrom Libyan jails. These included some of \nQaddafi’s own colleagues and coup participants, ar\xad\nrested in 1969 —Lieutenant Colonel Musa Ahmad \nand Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Hawwaz. Qaddafi \nwas shown on television bulldozing the walls of a \nprison and making statements to the effect that \nthere were no more political prisoners in Libyan \njails. The move was extremely popular and did \nmuch to diffuse simmering discontent. Qaddafi also \ninvited the Libyan opposition in exile to return \nhome, promising to return confiscated property, \nbut very few responded.\nIn November, 1988, Qaddafi announced the re\xad\nstructuring of the military and the creation of a new \nvoluntary paramilitary organization under a\n‘“Tripoli Television Service, January 9, 1989, in FBIS, \nJanuary 11, 1989, p. 8.\n13Ibid., p. 14.\n‘’Tripoli Television Service, November 3, 1988. in FBIS, \nNovember 4, 1988, pp. 11-14.\n15FBIS, January 17, 1989, p. 20.\n16Middle East Economic Digest, March 19, 1988, p. 17.\n17Tripoli Television Service, February 17, 1989, in FBIS, \nFebruary 18, 1987, p.

Apparently so was the official \nnews agency JANA, which he described as a “huge \noctopus with hundreds of officials” that did not \ndeliver news on time.15\nQaddafi feared the army that had attempted to \noverthrow him several times; it had become even \nmore threatening after its humiliating defeat in \nChad in early 1987. Consequently, the restructur\xad\ning of the traditional army was meant to purge \nsome of its more dangerous elements; while the \ncreation of still another voluntary paramilitary \nforce was further to weaken the regular army and \nexisting forces like the Jamahiri Guards and the \nPeople’s Militias. On the other hand, the abolition \nof the Jamahiri sports agency and the Jamahiri \nnews agency was probably part of the drastic pro\xad\ngram for reducing state expenditures. That pro\xad\ngram had been instituted in the second half of the \n1980’s when state revenues plummeted as a result of \nthe fall in oil prices.16\nThere was no change, however, in the way Qad\xad\ndafi dealt with political opposition. The Libyan \nauthorities used repression and violence in their \nconfrontation with the Islamic fundamentalists who \nhad become the most vocal domestic opposition \ngroup. In February, 1987, nine men were hanged \n(and their execution was televised) for allegedly be\xad\nlonging to the Islamic Jihad Organization and hav\xad\ning been involved in assassinations and acts of \nsabotage.17 In December, 1988, the authorities \ncracked down on students at the University of Trip\xad\noli, again in an attempt to quell protests and dem\xad\nonstrations purportedly organized by Islamic fun\xad\ndamentalists. During December, 1988, and \nJanuary, 1989, armed members of the revolu\xad\ntionary committees raided mosques during prayers \nand arrested a number of worshipers suspected of \nbeing members of Islamic organizations critical of \nthe regime.18\nQaddafi’s policy remained unchanged on the \ncreation of political parties or organizations in\xad\ndependent of the state. “Any exploitation of religion \nwill be nipped in the bud. Factionalism, sectarian\xad\nism, partisanship and party membership are forbid\xad\nden.”19 Qaddafi also threatened with retribution \nthose wishing to protest or demonstrate against his \npolicies, saying that he would use tanks against \ndemonstrators the way Joseph Stalin did in the \nSoviet Union.20\nIdeologically, there was no change. Algeria \ndropped the word “socialist” from its constitution, \nbut Libya made no such change. Injune, 1988, the \nGPC approved the passage of the “International\n', '152 •  CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1990\nGreen Document for Peace and Human Rights in \nthe Era of the Masses," which was designed as an \nalternative to the United Nations Declaration of \nHuman Rights. It stated that power belonged to the \npeople, that men and women were equal, that ex\xad\nploitation of others was illegal, that land belonged \nto all and that houses belonged to those who lived in \nthem; it also guaranteed the right to a fair trial. The \ndocument condemned terrorism and called for the \nabolition of chemical and nuclear weapons.21 In \nessence, it was a reformulation of the principles ex\xad\npressed a decade earlier in The Green Book.\nREGIONAL POLITICS\nAfter the breakup of the Arab African Federation \nwith Morocco in August, 1986, Libya found itself \nisolated in the region. Qaddafi immediately tried to \ncreate unions or alliances with neighboring states. \nAfter two failed attempts at uniting with Sudan and \nwith Algeria, Libya was invited to join the Arab \nMaghrebi Union with Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia \nand Mauritania in February, 1989.22\nThe inclusion of Libya in the union was strate\xad\ngically important for the other states of the Ma\xad\nghreb because Libya constituted a natural buffer be\xad\ntween Egypt —which was becoming once again a \ndominant player in Arab affairs —and the rest of \nNorth Africa. The union also enhanced Qaddafi’s \nposition domestically and brought him out of isola\xad\ntion regionally, thus increasing his influence and \ngiving him a longer lease on power.\nThe union was meant to be primarily an econom\xad\nic integration of the North African states, loosely \nbased on the European Community model, Conse\xad\nquently, even before the official creation of the \nunion, many bilateral and multilateral economic \nagreements were signed between the states in the \nregion. Libya and Tunisia, whose relations had im\xad\nproved dramatically after the demise of President \nHabib Bourguiba of Tunisia in November, 1987, \nreached a number of agreements on agricultural, \nindustrial and infrastructural projects.23 Tens of \nthousands of Tunisian workers were allowed to \nreturn to work in Libya, after having been expelled \nin 1985. Libyans were also permitted to travel freely \nto Tunisia, and it was reported that an estimated \none million had done so since early 1988.

They also set \nup a joint bank, the Arab Maghreb Bank for Invest\xad\nment and Trade, a petrochemical company and \neight other joint companies.24 Moroccan-Libyan \nrelations also improved when borders were opened \nwith all states of the union; however, trade re\xad\nmained rather limited, as Morocco focused more on \nits relations with Algeria than on relations with \nstates further east.\nPolitically, there are many implications for \nLibya. The treaty’s provisions include the stipula\xad\ntion that no state may enter a coalition that could \nthreaten the security or territorial integrity of the \nother members of the union.25 That limits Libya’s \nability to set up unions or alliances with any state it \nchooses; it may have to seek the approval of other \nmember states before embarking on such projects.\nAnother treaty provision stipulates that members \nof the union may not allow any activity on their ter\xad\nritory that threatens the security of the other mem\xad\nbers. Libya may no longer initiate attacks on its \nneighbors (as it did in Jarba, in 1980, against \nTunisia), nor may it support groups opposing any \nof the Maghrebi regimes, nor undertake terrorist \nactivities against its neighbors. The other side of the \ncoin is that none of the Maghrebi states may legit\xad\nimately offer a safe haven to the Libyan opposition \nin exile.\nThe policy to allow the free movement of people \nand goods among Maghrebi states also weakens the \nLibyan state’s control over its citizens. It gives them \nmore freedom to move and to seek employment \nelsewhere, and to buy goods and property abroad. \nBut more significantly, it allows for the freer move\xad\nment of ideas, books, magazines and newspapers. \nIn a region in which Islamic fundamentalism is \nrapidly becoming the major mobilizing force \nagainst existing regimes, this may be a dangerous \ndevelopment for Qaddafi.\nTHE EGYPTIAN-LIBYAN RAPPROCHEMENT\nOn October 16, 1989, after long months of nego\xad\ntiations, Qaddafi met Egyptian President Hosni \nMubarak in Marsa Matruh on the Mediterranean \ncoast of Egypt, on Qaddafi’s first visit to that coun\xad\ntry in 16 years. The next day, Mubarak and a high- \nranking delegation flew to Tobruk on the Libyan \ncoast to continue the talks. Both heads of state \n(Continued on page 177)\nMary-Jane Deeb coauthored (with Marius K.\nDeeb) Libya Since the Revolution: Aspects of Social and\nPolitical Development (New York: Praeger Publishers,\n1982).

It undoubtedly has considerable Libyan \nbacking, for Colonel Qaddafi (despite his agree\xad\nment on August 31, 1989, to allow the International \nCourt of Justice at The Hague to decide Libya’s \ndispute with Chad over the Aozou Strip) is most \nunlikely to miss an opportunity to embarrass the \nChadian government. However, the movement \nalso reflects considerable tribal resentment at the \nbehavior of the Habre regime and at the conse\xad\nquences of its policy of reconciliation.\nTHE FUTURE\nAt the same time, the Habre government can \nclaim that its de facto recognition by the OAU and \nthe United Nations —and by most countries in \nEurope and Africa —has led to de jure status as a \nresult of the referendum. It seems unlikely that the \nnew rebellion along the border with Sudan can \nthreaten the regime, despite Libyan support and \nSudanese complaisance. Yet it highlights a major \nproblem for the regime, which still depends on the \nsupport of the Gorane despite all the claims of \nreconciliation and of a new national spirit.\nAs the correspondent of Le Monde noted during a \nrecent visit to N’Djamena, Habre’s Gorane sup\xad\nporters control the capital, despite lip service paid to \nthe UNIR as the vehicle of political consensus and \ncontrol. They are also feared and hated by the peo\xad\nple, who refer to them as “unruly Dobermans.”15 In\xad\ndeed, the events of the past three years have left the \nGorane once again the undisputed masters of mili\xad\ntary power in Chad. They have definitively reversed \nthe post-colonial balance of power by ensuring that, \nas in pre-colonial times, the north once again con\xad\ntrols the destiny of the south of Chad.\nThe consequent political isolation of the Gorane \nmeans that the complex formal structure of the \nU N IR  and governm ent as instrum ents of \nreconciliation could soon be shattered. In the last \nanalysis, President Hissene Habre of Chad de\xad\npended on his own clients and on his ability to \nsatisfy other powerful patrons to guarantee his \npolitical survival. Yet to win the peace, he will have \nto escape their embrace and build on the formal \npolitical structures he has created. It is not yet clear \nthat he will be able to do so successfully. H\nMonde, December 9, 1989.\nLIBYA\n(Continued from page 152)\nseemed pleased with their discussions and agreed to \nopen “bureaus” in Tripoli and Cairo. This is the \nclosest equivalent to reopening embassies in the two \ncapitals without resuming formal relations.\nA joint communique was issued on the Libyan- \nEgyptian talks. The two sides agreed to facilitate the\nmovement of people between the two countries, to \nbuild a railway linking al-Sallum in Egypt with \nTobruk in Libya, and to improve navigation and \nroad links and facilitate the flow of information be\xad\ntween Libya and Egypt. They also decided to en\xad\ncourage trade and financial exchanges, agricultural \ncooperation, the setting up ofjoint companies for oil \nexploration and production, and marine fishing. \nLabor agreements were also reached.25 6\nThis may have been the most important foreign \npolicy decision that Qaddafi has made in more than \na decade. Resuming relations with Egypt means \nthat Qaddafi has returned to the Arab fold and has \nundertaken to follow a more moderate course in for\xad\neign policy vis-a-vis the Arab world. Having long \ncriticized Egypt for its peace treaty with Israel, \nLibya seems finally to have accepted the fact of \nIsrael’s existence, and has undertaken to ignore it.\nWith improved relations with Egypt, Libya is \nagain the link between the Maghreb and the Arab \nstates to the east of Libya. As a member of the Arab \nMaghrebi Union, Libya became strategically im\xad\nportant for Egypt, which did not want to become \nisolated in North Africa. The tug-of-war between \nMaghrebi countries and Egypt over Libya has \nresumed once more, endowing Libya and its leader \nwith more regional importance than they have en\xad\njoyed in years.\nIn October, 1988, in a speech to the World Af\xad\nfairs Council in Washington, D.C., William H. \nWebster, director of the United States Central In\xad\ntelligence Agency (CIA), disclosed that Libya was \ndeveloping a large chemical plant in Rabta, 40 \nmiles south of Tripoli, that could be used for \nchemical warfare. In April, 1989, the press revealed \nthat Libya had purchased 15 supersonic Sukhoi- \n24D bombers, with an alleged radius of 800 miles, \nand that it had reached an agreement with the \nSoviet Union to refit a Soviet Ilyushin-76, a \ntransport plane purchased earlier by Libya, to \nenable it to refuel the Sukhoi-24D in mid-air, thus \nincreasing its radius by 50 percent. Webster \ndescribed these developments as threatening \nstability in the Middle East and extending Libya’s \nwar capabilities as far north as West Europe.\nQualitative and quantitative changes in the pat\xad\ntern of arms procurement in Libya reflect major \nchanges in the political environment of the region. \nWhen Qaddafi feels threatened by these changes he \nincreases and diversifies Libya’s arms purchases.27 \nThus the United States bombing of Libya in April, \n1986, and the inability or unwillingness of the\n25See text ofjoint Egyptian-Libyan communique, in FBIS,\nOctober 18, 1989, p. 16.\n27See the author’s unpublished paper, “Foreign Policy Im\xad\nplications of Libya’s Acquisition of Missiles and Chemical \nWeapons,” presented at a seminar at the Fletcher School of Law \nand Diplomacy, Tufts University, Boston, April, 1989.\n', '178 •  CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1990\nSoviet Union to defend or even forewarn the Lib\xad\nyans led Qaddafi to reassess Libya’s national securi\xad\nty arrangements. His new policy focused on acquir\xad\ning more and better weapons and pacifying the \nUnited States.\nIn the wake of the United States raid of April, \n1986, Qaddafi began to expand and diversify \nLibya’s arsenal. He stated that Libya’s oil and iron \nand steel industries ought to be \ncom plem ented by strategic industries for defense \nagainst the Israelis, against the Americans and \nagainst Europe if it is an aggressor. H ad  you had mis\xad\nsiles capable of striking U .S . bases in Sicily, they \nwould not have attacked you .28 \nThose weapons, therefore, were perceived primari\xad\nly as a deterrent against external threats to Libya.\nLess than a year after the United States raid, Lib\xad\nya’s southern borders were threatened when Chad\xad\nians with French logistic support reached inside \nLibya’s territory and inflicted serious damage on its \nmilitary infrastructure. This defeat may have been \na determining factor in Qaddafi’s desire to develop \nchemical weapons. The use of such weapons by \nIraq, in its war with Iran, did not go unnoticed in \nLibya and it is not inconceivable that chemical weap\xad\nons may be used in future conflict with Chad. In \nother words, the acquisition of chemical weapons \nmay not be only for deterrent purposes.\nQaddafi’s pragmatic reaction to the United \nStates raid and the Chadian incursion was to in\xad\ncrease Libya’s arsenal of weapons while simulta\xad\nneously adopting a conciliatory policy toward those \ntwo countries. In May, 1988, he announced an end \nto the conflict with Chad and the recognition of its \ngovernment, and in October of that year diplomatic \nrelations were restored between Tripoli and \nN’Djamena.\nQaddafi made a number of attempts to improve \nUnited States-Libyan relations. In September,\n1988, he suggested in an interview that relations be\xad\ntween the two countries would improve only after \nthe United States elections, because President Ron\xad\nald Reagan had something against him personally. \nDespite the shooting down of a Libyan aircraft by \ntwo United States fighter planes in January, 1989, \nQaddafi continued to try to improve relations \nthrough negotiations over the frozen assets of five \nUnited States oil companies in Libya. Reuters news \nservice quoted sources in Tripoli saying that Libya \nwanted an end to the United States boycott of oil ex\xad\nports and the return of United States personnel to \nLibya to run their companies.29 On January 13,\n1989, Libya returned to Vatican representatives the\n28FBIS, October 3, 1989, p. 25.\n29Middle East Economic Digest, June 23, 1989, p, 18.\n™KCA, vol. 35, no. 3 (March, 1989), p. 36572.\n31FBIS, October 11, 1989, p. 15.\nbody of a United States serviceman shot down dur\xad\ning the United States raid in April, 1986. Later that \nmonth in a press interview, Qaddafi said he was \nwilling to hold official talks with President George \nBush’s administration about United States-Libyan \nrelations, and to work for the release of United \nStates hostages in Lebanon.30 Finally, Libyan \nForeign Minister Jadallah Azzuz Talhi was quoted \nin an Abu Dhabi-based daily as saying, “Libya \nwants normal ties with the United States based on \nmutual respect and without conditions from the \nAmerican side.31\nCONCLUSION\nLibya has embarked on a more moderate course \nboth domestically and in its foreign relations. The \nchanges, however, do not reflect a new spirit of re\xad\nform because the fundamental principles on which \nthe state is built have not changed significantly. \nThey reflect Qaddafi’s pragmatic attitude toward \npolitics: do what is necessary to remain in power \nand to protect Libya’s independence.\nAlthough there may be greater liberalization of \nthe economy in the months to come, there is little \nhope for political changes of any substance. After \nthe initial euphoria over new economic freedom \nsubsides, the realization of the limits of change will \nlead to more opposition to the regime. The Islamic \nfundamentalists in Libya, as in other parts of North \nAfrica, will constitute the most powerful mobilizing \nforce against the Qaddafi regime.\nThe Libyan leader will continue to pursue a more \nmoderate course in foreign affairs, without break\xad\ning his ties with old allies. Although a member of \nthe Arab Maghrebi Union, he will maintain close \nties with Egypt and will try to play a balancing \ngame between the states of North Africa. He has \nalready restored relations with Iraq, but maintains \ngood relations with Iran and has improved his rela\xad\ntions with the Palestine Liberation Organization \nwithout breaking his links with dissident Palesti\xad\nnian groups.\nInternationally, he will try to improve his image \nin the West and look for closer ties with the United \nStates, becoming less involved in support for ter\xad\nrorist groups and organizations worldwide. He will \nremain dependent on the Soviet Union for military \naid and on the Eastern bloc nations for trade. Since \nlittle more should be expected domestically, Qad\xad\ndafi’s major political moves will be on the interna\xad\ntional stage. ■\nSUDAN\n(Continued from page 156)\nresolve Sudanese problems rapidly through mana\xad\ngerial skills.
