Very small quan\ntities of platinum have been found\nin Borneo, Sumatra, Brazil.

The total production is\nnow about 18,250 pounds annually.\nEvery effort has heen made in\nRussia to locate new deposits ol the\nmetal, but without success The an\nnual quantity tends to decrease, and\nan exhaustion of the deposits at no\nery remote date seems almost a cer\ntalnty. At the same time the demand\nfor platinum has far outstripped the\nsupply, and has naturally caused an\nenormous increase In the price. In\n1892 platinum cost $89 per troy\npound, about one-third as much as\ngold.

The lo\ncation of these deposits is at Wen\nden. In Westphalia, in a section where\niron, lead, copper and zinc mines are\nabundant. While prospecting by drill\nin the neighborhood of Wendell, met\nallurgicul chemists unexpectedly dis\ncovered appreciable amounts of plnti\nnuin in the layers of rock covering\nthe ores of the common metals The\namount of platinum present m the\nrock vnries from 0.9 to 1.9 troy\nounces per cubic yard, which is very\nrich compared with the Russian de\nposits. "Steps have already heen taken to\nbegin the regular metallurgical ex\ntraction nf platinum at Wenden on\nlarge scale. It is thought that careful\nprospecting will reveal the presence\nof other extensive fields in the W . si\nphalian ore region, where geological\nformations similar to those at Wen\nden are widespread.\n"In the Westphalian deposits plati\nnum is present in the form of an\nalloy, and in the customary course of\nanalysis entered into solution in the\nform of a nitrate. A chemist decided\nto test the solution of nitrates oh\ntained In the normal course of an\nanalysis for the possible presence of\nplatinum, and this led to the unex\npected discovery.\n"It would nppear eminently desir\nable to carry on promptly Investlga\nlions in the 1\'niied States for possl\nble sources of the metal, utilizing\ndata gained at Wet.uen There mnv\nbe large tracts ri unsuspected wealth\ncapable of Selection by the revised\nC W.

Daring the\nGoidfieid boom in 1M he was a\nmessenger in Reno, with only a smat\ntering of acquaintance with the key,\nbut be was a rapid learner and rap\nidly developed from the student class\nto an expert operator. The demand\nfor men to diapatch the enormous\nla tall anli bualat a incidental to the\nperiod of inflation and high-grade\nshipments from the southern camp\ntaxed the capacity of the Western\nUnion to the utmost and few men\ncould be foand willing to undertake\nthe job of holding down a berth in\nthe Goidfield office.\nIt was a hum of day all day in the\ndaytime and there was no night for\nthe men in all lines of business. The\nSullivan Trust company, under the\ngiidance of George Graham Rice, was\nsending out daily tnessagi-s embrac\ning tens of thousands of words. Ad\nvertising copy was sent out over the\nwire and the immense full page ads\nof that company were changed daily\nby using the wires regardless of cost.\nThen there were such other promot\nti as Patrick, Elliott ii Camp, Don\nFerguson, Dr. Grant, Joe Hutchinson.\nG. S. Johnson and 8M brokers, all of\nwhom used the wires to an extent\nnever dreamed of. Only one office\nwas available, as the Postal company\nhad not yet strung its wires into the\nsouthern country, and the result was\nthat one fine Sunday morning the\nWestern I\'nion closed Its doors on\nall business to give the exhausted\noperators a chance to catch a little\nsleep. They had been working 2n\nand 22 hours a day and were all\ndone up by the high pressure ten\nsion Promoters and brokers offered\nbig bonuses to operators lo hav\ntheir business taken care of. and the\nboys are reputed to have coined extra\nmoney in this way One case stands\nauthenticated when $ln was paid a\nweary operator dragged out of bed\nafter daylight by a firm that had a\nthousand words to transmit.\nIt was during this frenzied state\nof business that Joe Savant, the kid\noperator, floated in from the placid\nbanks of the Truckee and was in\nstantly precipitated into the mael\nxtrom encircling ihe Western I\'nion\nHe held down his job with satlsfac\n\'ion lo the company and credit to\nhitnBelf and continued to hold down\nthe situation long after the boom had\nsubsided and business was reduced\nto normal lines. The traininir wa\nttle best a boy could have to steady\nhim and inspire confidence, and Joe\nproved that he could always be re\nlied on at any hour of the day or\nnight.\nAfter this experience Joe was ap\npointed manager of the Richmond\n(Cat) office, and then was trans\nferred to Vallejo. From the latter\nplace he comes to Tonopah familiar\nwith every detail of the responsihlli\nties he haa to assume as manager,\nand his friends will congratulate him\non the promotion.\nOPENS NEW LAND OFFICE.\n.1 E.
