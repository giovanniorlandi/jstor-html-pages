This prevision is found in every subsequent\nedition of "The Kentucky Statutes" or "The\nRevised Statutes of Kentucky" up te the re\nvision made by Messrs.

A "Fiscal Court" was substituted for\nth "County Court of Levy and Claims." The\norganization of cities was provided for in the\nConstitution. "Heme rule" was substituted\nfor control by the Legislature.\nThe Constitution provided that the "Fiscal\nCourt" could be organized in either of two ways.\nFirst by the County Judge nnd the Justices of\nthe Pesco in the county, or secondly by the\ncounty having "three Commissioners - te be\nelected from the county at Urge, who, together\nwith the Judge of the County Court, shall con\nstitute the Fiscal Court."

That all rights net in conflict\ntherewith, shall continue as valid as if this Cen\nstitutien had net been adopted \'\nThere is no prevision, express or implied, in\nthe Constitution that the Statute of 1852 which\nseparated cities and counties for governmental\npurposes was repealed; en the contrary, the\nseparation was fully recognized in Section 144,\nproviding for a Fiscal Court te control govern\nmental powers in the counties.\nAnd further, when the Constitution provided\nfor the limitations en the rate of taxation and\nthe percentage of indebtedness in cities, towns\nand counties, there is no intimation, express or\nImplied, that tbe cities should be burdened with\nthe taxes and iqdebtedness of the counties.\nWhen tbe General Assembly, October 17th,\n1892, enacted the law creating Fiscal Courts,\nwith their duties and pewers specifically pro\nvided, it recognized the separation of cities and\ncounties by enacting Section 1851, which is the\nlast in the chapter creating Fiscal Ceurts:\n"When for county governmental purposes a\ncity is by law separated from thn remainder of\nthe county, that portion of the county outside\nof the limits of such city shall be deemed the\ncounty within the meaning of this act."\nThere was no possible necessity for this limi\ntation unless it was the purpose of the General\nAssembly te protect cities from the outrageous\nand unjust burden of paying both city and\ncounty taxes, A member of the Fiscal Court\nremarked the ether day, that collecting county\ntaxes en city property was all right If the tax\npayers did net object, and paid them willingly\nand cheerfully.\nSince the Iniquity and injustice of collect\ning county taxes en city property has been\nenforced several hundred thousand dollars In\ncounty taxes have been paid by owners of prop\nerty in Lexington, which I believe ceald have\nbeen saved if any effort had bees maie te s e\ntect thalr rights under the StaW-ts of lb52,\ngives frbeM. , t\nI\'\nTOBACCO\nMUSLINS\nTeleDhene 83.\nHERE?\nNe claim has been made that the law ex\nempting city property from county taxation has\nbeen repea\'ed, and while this law does net ap\npear in the 1903 edition of the Kentucky Stat\nutes, the Act of February 29th, 1904, adopting;\n"the Kentucky Statutes, compiled and edited\nby Jehn D.Carrell," specifically prevides: "That\nthis Act shall net be construed te amend, modify,\nor repeal, any law or part thereof new in force\nand effect and net included in said Statutes."\nThn question is new up te property owners\nin Lexington.
