Ono person, and ono person alone,\ncimo to understand her her husband,\nConrad was n stupid man, and It Is\nlikely this was tho reason why ho cnuio\nto bo nn excellent auxiliary to his wife.\nIlavlng no ideas of his own, ho was\nreadily recipient of hers. For ten\nyears sho kept Instilling her way of\ndoing things Into him, so that at last\nnot only could sho trust him to follow\nher lead, but at times to take the Ini\ntiative on her methods.\nThere was much warfare hun small\nway In thoso days, attacks being made\nby ono suzerain upon another. In one\nof these Incursions upon tho domain of\nBaron Elglnbrod, wbcro Conrad and\nhis wlfo lived. Count Hastings, tho In.\ncurslonlst, took Conrad away with him,\nJiavlng learned that ho and bis wlfo\nhad accumulated money, and held his\nprisoner for ransom.\nConrad was thrown Into prison nnd\ntold that ho should stay there till he\npaid tho ransom. lie remained n cap\ntlvo some time, then sent word to his\ncaptor to say that If ho would give him\na messenger bo would send him to his\nwlfo with nn order to pay tho ransom.\nTho count at once furnished the mes\nsenger, nnd Conrad wrote the following\nmessage to Jonn:\nMy Dear Wife I wish you to pay the\nranaom demanded by Count Ilaetlnge for\nmy reteaee. I will wait for you to do so\nfor one week. One week from tonight It\nI am not liberated I will bang myaelf in\nthe chimney of the room where I am con\nfined. Tour loving huebaml, CONRAD.\nThis letter was submitted to theifcHint,\nwho read It with satisfaction, "for\'aald\nhe, "If the woman is Inclined to dicker\nas to the amount she shall pay, the\nthreat of her husband to hang himself\nwill Influence her to pay any sum 1\nask." And he donbled the amount de\nmantled for the ransom.\nWhen tho messenger delivered the\nnote to Joan and sho read her hus\nband\'s threat to hang himself sho fell\nover In a falut. The messenger did\nwhat ho could to revive her and en\ndeavored to reassure her by pointing\nout tho impossibility of tho prisoner\nSlanging himself in tho chimney, since,\nn tho first place, ho had no rope, and,\nin tho second place, even if bo had\nthero was nothing In tho chimney to\nwhich ho could attach a rope.\nThis seemed to comfort Joan, and,\ngathering her strength, she wrote her\nhusband a note stating that she would\nbo unablo to raise the money required\nfor tho ransom In so short a time, but\nsho would do so as soon as possible.\nSho added a nolo begging him not to\nhang himself, thus depriving her nnd\ntho children of his caro and tlfo pleas\nure of having him with them.\nTho mesxengor went back to tho\ncount with Joan\'s letter, and it was\nroad with satisfaction, for It was evi\ndent that -hUo was to terrified at her\nhusband\'s threat, notwithstanding tbo\nfact that It would be Impossible to\ncarry It out, that sho would do all in\nransom. So the message was deliver- I\nAit 4r fnntii1 wlirt rami If nrMnntlr\nplcasod nt tho prospect of getting his\nliberty,\nA week passed, and the night came\non which Conrad had threatened to\ncommit suicide unless his wlfo had by\nthat tlnio paid the roneom nnd set\nhim free. Ills Jailer, when lie brougnt\nin tho prisoner\'s supper and set it\ndown on the table, said Jokingly:\n"Woll, Conrad, are you going to hang\nyourself tonight\'"\n"Why should I? Sly wife has said\nthat she might not be nblo to raise tho\nmonoy for my ransom so soon, but 1\nam sure she will do so In time. I am\naware that lie must sell everything\nwo bare. Including our home, to raise\nso large an amount, nnd I don\'t ox\npoct. that she will bo able to turn It all\ninto ready money In Im than another\nweek, at least."\nWhr. tltti. did vou natao a rwtrlod\nInsufficient for her to ralto (ho ran\nsom?"\' Bacauaw I did not wish her to lose\nnuy tlaaa."\n"Well, I\'m glad you hare no reason\nto hang yourself, for If you did I\nshould hare to alt up and watch you\ntonight, and I prefer to be asle) lu\nmy bed."\nSo the Jailer left bin prisoner to eat\nhis supper, and wbeu be returned Con\nrad was Miortng loudly on lib) cot. The\nkeeper went away satisfied mat lucre\nwas no ilniiircr of tuo prisoner cheat\ning the count out nf his ransom by kill\ning himself, and he, too, betook him\nself to his. bed and was soon snoring\nas loudly ns Coo rod.\nWhen the noxt morning the Jailer\ntook Conrad\'s breakfast to htm, ex\npecting to seo his prisoner sitting, as\nusual, at the table walling for It, be\nI All 111\nwas- nstonfebed not to tee blm at alb\nMoreorcri therA\'wnt a utrannn fctirtnMi\nbvttfc room,1 thVsllsnco of-ahstneo of\'\nanr living\', thing Tlid tiiarr, thinking\'\nthat, afferalli hi, prisoner might havo\ncarried out- his threat, went\' to the\nch!mhcy fearing that he might see. his\nbody, dangllng-tlierci There\' was noth\ning in the lower part, and, looking up,\nbe saw only a small patch of blue sky.\nWith fear end trembling tho Jailer\ntint word to the count that his prison\ner had vanished. In order to shield\nhimself, ho declared that ho had heard\ntrango sounds overhead during the\nnight IIo believed that bis prisoner\nhad carried out his threat to hang him\nself and that witches hnd carried off\ntho body.\nThat was an ago when people, instead\nof looking for natural causes, Inferred\neverything to supernatural Interfer\nence. The count so far leaned to tho\njailer\'s opinion that ho did not look far\nfor a means of thcprlsoncr\'s escape IIo\nexamined tbo only outlet, tbo chimney,\nand satisfied himself that Conrad could\nnot havo climbed tho flue. In those\ndays chimneys wcro very large, and\nfor ono to work himself up n fluo by\nbis knees on ono sldo nnd his back on\ntho other was Impossible. Conrad must\nhavo hung himself, and there was no\naccounting for tho disappearance of\ntho body except that tho witches had\ncarried It off.\nTho Jailer\'s suggestion saved him\nfrom punishment, nnd vtho count was\nobliged to forego tho ransom. IIo was\nbecoming reconciled to his disappoint\nment when ono d.iy n neighbor of Con\nrod\'s came across tho border nnd re\nported tho suicide living nt homo in\ncomfort with his wlfo and children.\n. Tho count was astonished. Indeed,\nho would not bellevo tho report until\nho had sent a. spy Into tho enemy\'s\ncountry to learn tho truth. When tho\nspy returned and said that he had seen\nConrad sitting beforo his door, tho\ncount was convinced that he was there.\nBut the spy, believing that witches had\nassisted Conrad to get away, supposed\nhimself to be under the lnflucnco ot hd\nImagination. Conrad \'was sitting mo\ntionless nt tho time, nnd the spy got tho\nIdea Into his head that ho was a corpse.\nHo reported that ho had watched tho\nfigure ten long minutes, In all of which\ntlmo It tnado no motion.\nTho count, disgruntled nt having lost\nhis ransom nnd not satisfied with his\nspy\'s report, sent another, who saw\nConrad chopping wood. This disposed\nof tho theory that witches had carried\nback tho corpso of o suicide, nnd tho\ncount determined to mako a raid Into\ntho domain of Count ElglnbrUd with\nn view lo again carrying off the wealthy\nConrad.\nXow, Conrad\'s home was near the\nborder, and all the count hnd to do\nwas to send a force across, kidnap Con\nrad and carry blm away before any of\nthe baron\'s forces could be brought to\nprotect htm. But It happeued that\nJoan had been looking out of the win\ndow when the second spy saw her hus\nband chopping wood and watclied the\nman slipping away, as he supposed,\nunnoticed. Joan suspected what this\nmeant nnd straightway took precau\ntions. Sho sent one Oldershow, n\nneighbor, to Count Hastings\' domain\nto win tho confidence of tho count and\nngrco for a consideration to cntlco Con\nrad away from his homo so that ho\ncould bo readily captured. This man\nsucceeded in his object. At the sama\ntime ho was instructed by Joan to re\nport that Joan was a witch.\nThis confirmed Count Hastings\' be\nlief in the Jailer\'s suggestion that\nwitches had been Instrumental In Con\nrad\'s disappearance, but ho attributed\ntho removal to ono witch, Conrad\'s\nwife. Nevertheless, ho was so averse\nto being boatcn even by n witch thnt\nho accepted Oldcrshow\'s offer and,\nhaving paid him n round sum, sent n\ndozen men with him to kidnap Conrad.\nTho expedition approached Conrnd\'a\nhouse In the evening gloaming, and\nwhat was tholr horror to see tho mnu\nthoy wore nftcr hanging by tho neck\nto n treo near his house. They at onco\ntook (o flight and never stopped run\nning till they had reached their start\ning point, having left Oldershow be\nhind them. They reported what they\nhad seen to the count, and Oldershow,\nreturning, entered Conrad\'s house nnd\npoured n heap of gold he had received\nfor his work In Joan\'s lap.\nThis ended Count Hastings\' efforts\nto rognln possession of Conrad, for ho\nwas convinced ot his being managed\nby n witch, that witch \'being Joan.\nBut ho sent a messenger to Barou Kl\nglnbrod to say that tho boron had a\nwitch In his dominions, nnd If ho did\nnot get rid of her sho would Infect tho\nwhojp country..\nUpon this the baron sent for Joan\nand asked her what truth there was\nIn tho count\'s charge.\n"Ploase, your worship," replied Joan,\n"when Count Hastings raided your do\nmain he carried off my husband and\nheld blm for ransom. When the pris\noner wrote me that if I did not pay\ntho ransom by a certain date ho would\nhang himself lu the chimney I knew\nthat there was u chimney lu the room\nwhore he was confined and that be\nmeant that I should on n certain night\nsend some one or go myself, get on tho\nroof ami let a rope down by which he\ncould climb. I sent ouo Oldershow.\nwho succeeded In doing that, and my\nhusband escaped.\n"Suspecting that the count would try\nagain to make my husband his prison\ner, I sent Oldershow lo win his con\nfidence and pilot a party to mako tho\ncapture. I tnado a stuffed figure of my\nhusband and hung It to a treo uenr tho\nhouse. When they camo to tako him\nthey wcro frlghtonod and ran away.\nInstead of tho count getting a ransom,\nI got tho money ho paid my messenger\nto lead his men into a trap."\nTho baron was so well pleased with\nJoan\'s story that ho gavo her a tract\nof land near his castle, wbcro sho and\nber family would bo in Jess danger\nfrom Count Hastings\' Incursions.\nBy the-club arrangement with the Eyansville Cour\nier we can send you tho first daily news\npaper in this section\nIhe EVANSVILLE COURIER\nand\nThe EARLINGTON BEE\nfor i year by mail for the price of the Courier alone\nCourier (Daily) 1 year $4.00 A\nBee (Semi-Weekly) ! year $l.00JM\'\nSend or bring the- club price to this office and re\nceive both papers one year by mail\nYour favorite daily and home\ntown paper for the one price\nThis will be a year of sensational news everyone\n. p. should have a daily paper\nIf the great Sunday CcurieralsO is desired add $2.00\nto the club price\nBridging the\nyou and ,\nThe Bell Telephone,\nwire, brings millions of people within earshot of\nyour voice.\nMany thousand of them, living within fifty or a\nhundred miles, can be reached for a small toll charge.\nAre you making use of this vast bridge on your\nfarm, in your home or in your business.
