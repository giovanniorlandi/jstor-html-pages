APR. 7. lt 10.\nThe position taken by the Pope in\nrequiring Mr. Roosevelt to practical?\nly pledge himself not to visit a\nProtestant congregation while in\nRome, was probably all right in\nRome. We Americans have no\nconception of the feelings that pre\namong the people of that dis\ntant land as regards the controversy\nbetween the Pope and those Metho?\ndists whom the head of tbe Catholic\nchurch dislikes. However, asapri\nvate citizen, and an ex-President of\nthe United States. Mr. Roosevelt did\nexactly the right thing when he de\n**d to accept the conditions im?\nposed bv the Vatican. In this\n; country -ive recognize the right of\ncn to worship as they please,\nreserving only the right to differ with\nthem. Roman Catholics in this\ncolt have no trouble in un?\nderstanding the situation, and we are\nthey think more of Roosevelt\n_a*_ position he took. "In Rome\ndo as the Romans." but an Ameri?\ncan citizen worth three hurrahs in\nAmerica will not yield his principles i\nfor even so great and good a man as\nPope Pius.\nal Anti-Saloon League\'s threat\ndoes not give usa moment\'s anxiety. \'\nIt has used the Democratic party as\nlong as it needs it probably, and will\ncow play a little politics of its own.\nThe Democratic party in Virginia is\npledged to local option. It elected\nJudge Mann on tnat issue. That\nstatewide will be the main issue in\nthe election of a Legislature depends\n?molly upon the Democratic party,\naot upon the Anti-Saloon League as\nan organization. Prohibition is not\na tenet of Democracy; local option\nis. If the preachers will confine\nthemselves to preaching the gospel,\nteaching and preaching temperance,\nlove and charity to our neighbors,\nthe liquor problem will solve itself\nautomatically. The country is more\nlin need of a good, old time revival\nof brotherly love than it is of prohi\n*m. which does not mean tem?\nperance by a long slide.\nDo you want to find the tax-dodg?\ner in your county? If you do. ask\nvour judge to appoint you assessor\nnext time. That\'s what an assessor\nfrom a neighboring county tells us.\nHere we understand, from a close\nand intimate association with the\nassessor, that there are no tax-dog?\ners, but there are a few whose prop?\nerty is not valuable at assessing time,\nbut was the most desirable in the\ncity a year or two ago. It is de\n\'< praciating now at the rate of about\n25 per cent a day. By the time the\nassessor reaches the West End he\nexpecta to find large building iots\nworth just 0. Now is the time to\nbuy real estate, and we suspect the\nlocal assessor could give you some\nvaluable information.\nThe quarterly reports of the two\nlocal banks show a decided gain\nover laat quarter. This speaks well\naot only tor the management of\nthese institutions, but indicates that\nbusiness conditions are improving\nalso. The late panic affected this\nsection probably less than any other I\nin the country and it came Later.\'\nTbe prosperity of the banks of a\ncoo* mom ty reflect the conditions of i\ntnat community.

Very little has been said\nof the queen of the farm, altaough\nreams of poetry have exalted the\nrule of cotton and corn. We pro?\npose a toast to the hen, the queen of\nAmerica\'s farm products, the mos1\nuseful and valuable biped of our ac.\nquaintance. The American eagle\nbeats the hen on looks, but a great\ntul nation, indebted to the humble\nhen for the millions she has added\nto our revenues, could do much\nworse than to give Biddy her just\nplace on our national ensign.?Frank?\nlin News.\nGood. But Scarce.\nThe great want of this world is\nmen; men who are honest, sound\nfrom center to circumference, true to\nhearts core; men who will condemn\nwrong in friend or foe, in themselves\nas well as othes; men whose con?\nsciences are as steady as the needle\nto the pole; men who stand for the\nright if the heavens totter and the\nearth falls; men that never flag nor\nflinch; men that have courage with?\nout shouting; men in whom the cur?\nrents of everlasting life run still deep\nand strong; men who do not cry or\nspoil their voices to be heard on the\nstreets but who will not fall or be\ndiscouraged, till judgment be set on\nthe earth; men who will not lie; men\nwho are not too lazy to work nor too\nproud to be poor; men who hold\ntheir places and keep them; men who\nare willing to eat what they have\npaid for. ?Claremont Herald.\nSweet Charity.\nWhen a man or woman has done\nsomething wrong in his or her life\nand has thoroughly repented of it\nand is endeavoring to atone for the\npast by an honest and moral life, the\np:rson who deliberately spreads\nabroad stories of the person\'s earlier\nmissteps and thereby kicks the re?\npentant one down to the bottom\nround of the ladder again, is as bad\nas a murderer, We do not envy\nsuch a talebearer his meditations or\nhis future fate. Yet such a thing is\noften witnessed among some who\nprate of an abundant fund of right?\neousness. If there were more chari?\nty there could be less laws.?East\nera Shore Herald.\nAdvantage of Educstioo.\nBroadly speaking, the province of\nthr woman is the home and the\nhousehold; that of the man is the\nfield and the world. It is readily\nrecognized by all, therefore, that the\ntraining which will best fit the girl to\nbe a good wife, a good mother and\na capable and efficient manager of\nher future household is the best;\nand the training that will fit the boy\nto become a useful and productive\ncitizen, a good husband and a good\nfather is the best for him. These\ngeneral lines are recognized by every\none, but there are sub-divisions al-!\nmost equally important, but almast;\nuniversally neglected in the earlier j\neducation. For example, in the\'\nState ot Virginia, and. for that mat- \\\nter, in many other States, the public\nschool system, which is mamu med\nat vast expense, is only to be defend?\ned on sound economic principles by\nthe advantage to the State in having\nall its citizen, educated, and so fit?\nted for citizenship. And yet it hap\npaas that while the greatest economic\nneed af the State is trained and edu\ncated cultivators of thc soil, with a\nfew exceptions recently introduced,\nperhaps nothing could be -arther\napart than the public schooi training\n[tad tht science tad prichoa of afri\nBacon News Budget.\nBacon.
