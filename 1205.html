Dewey, at present state super\nintendent of public instruction, has officially\nannounced his candidacy for representative\nto Congress from at large. He is well and\nwidely known especially among the school\nteachers of the state, but in politics, that\nkind of acquaintanceship never amounts to\nvery much, but vote for the two represen\ntatives from at large is going to be badly\ncut up and if the teachers will "log roll"\nfor him he may stand a chance of winn\ning.\nAlbert J. Goddard lead the councilmanic\nticket and that too inspite of the Don Quix\notic efforts of the Civic league. The circulars\nsent out the day before the election by either\nthe Civic league or some aggregation of\ncriminals seem to have done Mr. Goddard\nlittle or no harm. Mr. Goddard will not be\nfair to himself unless he runs the ones down\nresponsible for those circulars and then pro\nceed against them through the courts.\nEugene Schmitz, former mayor of San\nFrancisco, has been acquitted of one of the\nmany bribery charges against him, which\nmay mean the dismissal of them all. Abe\nRuef was brought from the penitentiary, to\ntestify against Schmitz. but refused to come\nthrough and Sehmitz goes free while Ruef\nreturns to prison. The Damon and Pythias\nyarn pales into insignificance when com\npared with the Ruef-Sehmitz determination\nto die by each other.\nWilliam Howard Taft, president of the\nUnited States, v again swinging round the\ncircles evidently for the purpose of counter\nacting the effect of the Roosevejt maneuvers\nof recent dates. He plans to answer Roose\nvelt\'s arguments and completely show the\nfallacy of his theories.\nHenry Mcßride, he of much local political\nfame in years gone by, has been made presi\ndent of the Roosevelt organization of this\nstate. Mr. Mcßride is a scrapper from way\nback, but totally lacking in diplomacy,\nwhich was wholly responsible for his own\npolitical downfall. The question is, can he\ndo for another what he ignominously failed\nto do for himself. Had he have used or\ndinary horse senes he would not have been\ndefeated.\nHyram Charles Gill\'s late defeat must\nmake his friends feel like the Swede, who\nwhile walking\' down a railroad track, with\na friend. They saw a train coming, and the\ntwo supposedly stepped off the track,\nHans to one side and Ole to the\nother. After the train had passed\nHans did not see Ole and felt a hit indign\nant at him because he thought he had\njumped on the train and left him. So he\nstarted to return home. As he walked along\nthe track he first saw a man*s foot, then an\narm, then a leg, then a body, and by that\ntime he was growing suspicious, and when\nhe finally saw Oles head, he exclaimed in\nutter dismay: "My God. something surely\nhas happened to Ole!"\nBig Billy Bigger, nsin^ the familiar ver\nnamlar of the streets nf Bellinjrham. has\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nannounced his candidacy for representative\nto Congress and he has adopted 4 8888 as\nhis campaign slogan. After the campaign\nlie may find it necessary to add another\n"I>," which in connection with the other\nfour might be interpreted as follows: Big\nHill Biggar (of) Bellingham Badly Beaten.\nJ. W. Bryan, the fighting little cuss from\nKit.say county, who tried to break into con\ngress from the first district two years ago,\nhas come back, and has announced his can\ndidacy for congress from at large. While\nthe American people will travel for many\nmiles to see a light, yet on the whole they\nhave a mightly little respect for the fellow Ts\nthat actually do the fighting, and for that\nreason Bryan will not prove to be a popular\ncandidate for congress. In .seeking the office\nlie is doing so as a, Republican, but once\nin congress and he would not vote a .single\ntime with the Republicans unless he did so\nby mistake.\nHarry E. Wilson has been named by Gov.\nI lay to the position on the public service\ncommission made vacant by the resignation\nof John <\\ Lawrence, who hopes sooner or\nlater to force Gov. Hay to resign or quit the\nthe gubernatorial job. Wilson is a Seattle\nlawyer and since he has been a member of\nthe King county bar he has almost made a\nLiving for himself, but now he is assured of\nthree squares a day and the many other com\nforts and luxuries the office in the way of\nemoluments bring to the occupant. The ap\npointment strengthens Hay in Seattle.\nE. C. Carroll, general agent of the Pacific\nSlates Telephone Company, is sore over the\ntie-up of the merger of the telephone com\npanies, but Mr. Carroll only smiles when he\nis reminded of the Hat-foot falsehoods the\nlocal managers of the two telephone com\npanies made to Mayor Dilling when he ac\ncused them of clandestinely merging the two\ncompanies. Each on their honor (?) de\nclared that no such was heing done or con\ntemplated, and at that very moment it was\nas good as done. Men who will on their\nhonor (?) make such a statement, when they\nknow them to he falsehoods are not the\nmen to be trusted when your hack is turned.\nSuch men only have standing with their fel\nlow men on account of the money they have\nto bribe men with like criminal minds\nWhat the people of Seattle should do at this\ntime is to rise up in their might and forcibly\ntear to pieces the merging wires of the two\ncompanies that those deceptive managers\nmight understand that, the people have some\nrights the corporations are bound to respect.\nHorace McClure of more or less local\nnewspaper fame has been elected president\nof the Seattle Press Club. Horace is one\nof a brilliant family of boys, four of whom\nlive in Seattle, and are Leading legal prac\ntitioners. For some unaccountable reason\nhe lias stuck to newspaper work and has had\nthe newspaper man\'s luck, sometimes up\nbut more often down, while his brothers\nhave grown immensely rich in the legal pro\nfession. Mr. McClure is one of the brilliant\nFriday, March 8, 1912.\nwriters of Seattle, but he does not seem to\nbe of the temperament to popularize the\nPress Club and make it useful as well as\nornamental.\nProf. Edgar F.

Owing to the\neverlasting political commotion in Mexico\nand the repeated humiliations the citizens of\nthe United States are compelled to undergo\nat the hands of Mexicans, such a campaign\nslogan would be very popular. There is no\ndoubt of the fact that the sentiment is grow\ning in this country that the only way to\npreserve peace in Mexico is to put peaceful\nAmericans in charge. If the United States\ndoes not take steps to preserve peace and\norder in Mexico either England or Germany\nwill do so, and, if reports be true, Germany\nis "spiling" to do so, and should she do so,\nthen the Panama canal would be worse than\nworthless to the United States.\nThe Union Jack now flies over the south\npole, while the Stars and Stripes triumph\nantly wave over the north pole.

Some time ago\nCommodore Perry and Matt Henson, two\ncitizens of the United States, reached the\nnorth pole and took possession of it in the\nname of the government of the United\nStates. Owing to the scarcity of homestemls\nin both England and the United States a\nlively emigration may be expected to set\nin to these new found possessions of both\ncountries and it ought not to be very long\nbefore an all rail conveyance will be ope\nrated between the two poles.\nraj 81\nI 1\nALBERT J.

With but two exceptions all of the\npapers published in the county were repre\nsented and participated in forming the as\nsociation. The first official act of the new\nassociation was to take a fall out of the\npolitical publicity hogs in the passage of the\nfollowing preamble and resolution:\n"Whereas, These institutions and persons\nare groAving fat and the politicians power\nful through this means; and\n"Whereas, This method of exploitation\nand the matters so exploited are purely of\na commercial nature and have thus far been\nof no pecuniary value to these newspapers;\ntherefore, be it\nResolved, That all political and commer\ncial news having a commercial value to the\nsender shall be accepted and published only\nat regular rates."\nThere were seventeen newspaper men\npresent.\nNegro is Risen.

Both had served short\nterms in the Fulton county jail, and being\nunable to pay their fines wenf through the\ncustomary formalities of swearing that they\npossessed Qot over $20 which could be used\nto pay the fine. "Mr. Blalock," called\nClerk Puller, and he administered the cus\ntomary oath. "Sign your name right here,"\ncontinued the clerk. "Aw, I can\'t write my\nname," replied the man in a natural tone,\nas if such a tiling were an every-day occur\nrence, and the clerk wrote the name and let\nBlalock touch the pen as he put the cross\nunderneath the necessary "his mark." "All\nright, Sol," called the clerk as he told Blal\nock to go. Tlie Xegro, who appeared to be\nan ordinary country Negro, took the oath\nand wrote in a fairly legible hand his full\nname, "Solomon Williams," bowed to Mr.\nFuller and left the office.\n"Do you know that is one of the com\nmonest tilings up here that happens in my\noffice and one of the most —well, disgust\ning." Clerk Fuller added after pausing for\nthe righi word.

It costs\nthe city between $700,000 and $800,000 a\nyear to maintain its evening classes. Super\nintendent Maxwell has come to tin; convul\nsion that all this effort for the younger pu\npils is "worse than useless," The city is\ntherefore asked to abolish the night schools\nlor all but adidts and organize another or\nder of school for children who work through\nthe day. Employers are not to be granted\nall the effective hours of the boy\'s or girl\'s\nday, but are to release their young employ\nees for attendance at "continuation\nschools," lasting from 7 to i) a. m. and from\n4to (> [). m. The school will then have a\nfair chance at a boy when his mental ener\ngies are not exhausted by a, day in office or\nfactory. In Dr. Maxwell\'s report to the\ncity\'s Board of Education he writes of the\nmore than Si). 000 registered in the elemen\ntary night schools: "The school time is\ntaken out of their time for recreal ion --the\nevening hours."\nThe recommendation is backed up by ar\ngument based not only on justice, but on ex\npedience. Thus:\n"Money is being spent most Liberally <>n\nihc education in splendidly equipped high\nschools of those hoys and who are so\nsituated thai they can make school-going\nthe chief business of their lives until they\nare at least eighteen, and often much Longer.\nAre the state and the city to take so little\ninterest in the less fortunate, who are in the\ngreal majority, that all the education they\nran offer them is the three K\'.s at the period\nof the day when the brain refuses, or is too\nweary, to ad .\' Are employers to have the\nbest of tin- child\'s day at toil that is often\ngrinding and poorly remunerative, and leave\nhim little, if any, chance to cultivate those\nfunctions of mind and body upon which\nsuccess and happenings in after-life depend?\nThe interest of the community as well as of\nthe individual demands that the child who\nhas not the opportunity to pusue a hi^h\nschool course, or even to complete the ele\nmentary school, shall be kept under the\ntutelage of the state and shall be given such\nSchooling as he can profit by until the end\nof the high-school age.
