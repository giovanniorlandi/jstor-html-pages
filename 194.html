L. Hawkins said1\nthis morning to the reporter that\nwithout question his mother, Mrs.\nMary A. Hawkins, was entitled to\nthe distinctive honor of hein# the\noldest living settler of Waxahaehie.\nKhe and her husband, the late H. F.\n\' Hawkins, moved to Waxahaehie in\n! the winter of 1849 and located in a\ncabin just below the VV. A. Brings\nplace. At that time Cncle Robert\nM ay field lived near the city and\nMa{. K. \\V.

On the 30ih of next Jan-J\nuiary Mrs. Hawkins will be 73years i\nold, but d< spite this advanced age\nshe is enjoying reasonably good\nhealth.\nThe question of \\\\ axahachie\'s\noldest settler brings up some very )\ninteresting history of the early set\ntlement and organization of Kills\ncounty.\nBy an act of the legislature the\ncounty was organized in the winter\nof 1349-.V), there being but one bun-1\ndred legal voters in the county by |\nactual count. Mr. B. F. Hawkins\nwas one of ten commissioners ap\npointed to organise the county and\nthe necessary petition to be present\ned to thelegielature required the sig"\nnature of every voter in the county.\nAfter ninety-nine name* had been\n«••cured Mr. Hawkir*1- rode for three\nday s before he found the hundredth\nman. 7h<· · "•■•\'•ion of offieera was\nbold in August, Is.», and Mr. Haw\nkins w:: ι ι l.-ct\'d county cl(»rk.

We ^reached Stamford iu\nJones county at 5:30 p. m., on time.\nThere we took a hack—the "Haskell\nFlyer" and got to that historic town\nat 10:30p. m. and I can tell you that\nblack mud is not the only mud that\nsticks to carriage wheels in Texas.\nAbout four times in the first four\nmiles our conductor had to stop the\ntrain and get out and claw the mud\noff the wheels for they had got\n"solid." But finally we struck bet\nter road and sailed into Haskell in a\nsweeping trot, thanks to West Texas\nhorses, the best goers and stayers\non earth. About twelve o\'clock that\nnight I reached the home of my\ndaughter, the sweetest and best wo\nman on earth, and the heartfelt kiss\nof welcome from her and those two\nhandsome Texas boys paid for all\nthe worry of travel and mud, and\nmade the world seem brighter and\nbetter.\nFor seven days and nights I en\njoyed the scenery in that lovely\ncountry where the prairie dogs bark\nall day and the cavote wolves howl\nall night. Now these dogs are not\nof the species of dog that the poet\nsays "The wistful dog looked up\nand whined a welcome home," but\n\' they can let you know that they are\nthere all the same. We drove into\nthe nice little town of Haskell every\nday and, of course, I met a great\nmany people; and strange to say\nevery one seemed to be glad to meet\nUncle Snort, and that put me on\nmy mettle, and cauned mn to do\nmuch biff talking. Much of which,\nI cod fee β, that if a man wore bay\ning troth at one dollar per yard, he\nwould not be willing to pay more\n£5 cent» per yard for. When men\nwould say to me -\'Why Uncle Snort\nI thought that you was an old man;\nI am astonished to see you looking\nso young." I would say "Oh, no,\nwidowers and old maids never get\nold." It would have done your\nheart good too, if you could have\nheard them asking me about Inno\ncence Abroad and Jumbo. "Tell us\nwhat sort of fellow is that Inno-i\ncence, anyway." 1 would say.\n"We\'l, boys, he is just a jolly good !\nfellow since he has married, and !\nhis wife has sent a flood of bright\nness and sweetness into his life.\nHe now washes his face and combs\nhis hair every morning before break\nfast and shaves off his beard about\ntwice a week. His wife has got him\nused to wearing good clothes and\nkeeping good company :md if she\ncan keep him away from circuses\nand dog and pony shows, she is in a\nfair way to have him tolerably well\ncivilized in a few more years. It is\ntruf that when he gets out among\nthe boys his first love will rush into\nthe gallery of his memory and then\nhe unlimbers and turns loose some\nhigh colored anecdotes which is\nvery severe on ones imagination to\nbelieve. It is true that making a\nchristian of him was a mammoth\nundertaking but his wife is not only\nmaster of the situation, but is equal\nto the occasion and is very fast get\nting him under good control."\n"Well," says one, "now tell us\nabout Jumbo."\n"Oh, Jumbo, he is a dead give\naway. He goes all the gaits from a\nstreet parade to a chicken fight.\nHe is rather small of stature but\nwears the biggest smiles and more\nof them than any man in ten coun\nties. He pleads law in the court\nhouse and tells big yarns on the\nstreets, and is destined some day to\nrepresent his district in congress if\ntiis tongue holds out and his face\ndon\'t kill him."\n"What\'s tlie matter with his\nface?" asked some one.\n"Oh, he\'s so furiously ugly that,\niiis wife or one of his little daugh- j\nters have to sit up every night until !\nmidnight to wake him up to let iiis\nface rest." Just then George Wil\nliams came up and said, "Say,\nUncle Snort, what about the new\ninvention that Jumbo i s having\npatented."\n(Continued tomorrow.)\nWe will appreciate your patronage\nand influence.

From a bread-winning\nstandpoint, the work of the public\nschools and that of the old line\ncolleges and diversities is very\ndeficient. TheLi work ought to be\nsupplemented with some good every\nday businesjr training, such as a\npractical knowledge of single and\ndouble entry bookkeeping, how to\nwrite drafts, notes, contracts, mort\ngages, and in short, banking, ordi\nnary business law, plain, rapid\npenmanship, typewriting, etc.; not\nmerely copying this from text\nbooks. The school ought to be pro\nvided with actual banks, railroad,\nmercantile, commission, real estate,\ninsurance, shipping offices, etc., so\nthat all students may learn these\nthings in a practical way by doing\nthe work itself, and not merely\nreading about it or copying from\nhooks.
