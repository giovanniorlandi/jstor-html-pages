Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Alas\nka, Hawaii and the Philippines, rep\nresenting the sentiment of 200,000\nmembers, asking for the permanent\nestablishment in Pacific waters of a\nfleet of 12 battleships.\nFourteen vessels of the Pacific\nfleet, eight of them heavily armored\ncruisers, joined the Atlantic fleet in\nwhat was the greatest parade of\nships of war our navy has ever\nknown. Through the crowded har\nbor the combined fleets, under the\ncommand of Rear Admiral Robley D.\nEvans, who yesterday flung * again\nhis flag to the breeze from the deck\nof the Connecticut, threaded their\nwqj to the anchorage grounds, their\nprogram being heralded by never\nceasing blasts \' of steam whist\'es\nafloat and the ringing of bells\nashore.\nNo sooner had the fleet reached\nthe final anchorage than com\nmittee boat carrying Mayor Taylor\nand the officials of the reception\ncommittee put off to welcome Ad\nmiral Evans to San Francisco.

Unless the\nhead is found today officers will\nmake a postmortem examination of\ntbe remains of Mrs. GunneBs and\nsubject that to a more careful analy\nsis to learn whether the woman was\nherself killed or had substituted the\nbody of one of her female victims\nfor herself and then set fire to the\nhouse to cover up the crime.\nIn case it is proved Mrs. Gunnees\nsubstituted the body of another\nwoman for her own, it is very likely\nthat she is also guilty of the murder\nof her three children.\ncivil servie« has been merged with\nthe auditing bureau. The American\nofficials are most seriously affected,\nand It is believed the commission\nwill reject the majority of the pro\nposals. The American officials and\nmerchants are disturbed over the\nproposals, which many assert are\nclearly designed* to make it impossi\nble for Americans to fill positions in\nthe civil service.

He was\narrested on a charge of burglary,\nalleged to have been committed in\nthe Big Creek section, a district to\ncated near the Thunder Mountain\ncamp, but tbe real purpose of thel^^\narrest Is said to have been to secure\nhis confinement during the time the\nofficers were Investigating the disap\npearance of hia partner. After a\nsearch lasting several months the\nofficers were unable to find the body\nof the missing man or secure such\nevidence as would insure Martin\'s\nconviction, and he was ordersd re\nleased.\nWhile confined In the Idaho eoun\nty Jail he endeavored to effect an\nescape by burning the jail, and after\nsecuring his liberty on the charge\nof arson he came to Lewiston, where\nhe remained for a few days.\nAfter leaving here he was arrest\ned at Moscow and Wallace on\ncharges of insanity, but was after\nwards released, as his mental de-j\nrangement was due to the excessive 1\nuse of drugs.\nThe parents of Martin remained\nin Orangeville for some time, and|\nduring their stay there U . la said ;\nMartin conducted himse\'f in a most]\nexemplary manner. After their de- j\nnarture for their home in New York j\nhe returned to the drug habit and j\nthe trouble followed.

This\nspring has been marked all over the\ncountry with late killing frosts and\nin many places the fruit has been\nsaved by systematic smudging.\nIn the valley of the Grand river\nin Colorado where the crop this year\nit estimated at 2,000 car loads, the\nsmudging alone saved the growers\nfrom losing the whole crop, as It\nwas, the loss is estimated by Man\nager Moore of the Fruit Growers\'\nassociation at a million dol ars. Put\nwhere the smudging was systemati\ncally done the loss was only slight\nand the statement is made that It is\ndemonstrated that the Grande val\nlev need never lose another fruit\ncrop.\nIn an open statement to the grow\ners of the association the following\nassertions are made:\n"I wish to say right here that t\nmust admit that it ha3 long been\na question with me as to whether\nthe high prices being paid for land\nwere justified or not. I have had\nsome doubt because we occasionally\nlose some portion of our fruit crop. !\nBut that doubt is all gone now, for i\nIr has been fully and completely\ndemonstrated that, by the use of a !\nsmudging system, .this valley need\nnever lose another fruit crop, and.\nwith a fruit crop assured every year\nthe fruit lands of the Grand valley 1\nare not valued one bit too high.\nWith the certainty of a full fruit\ncrop each year and with good prices\nalwavs available fr our fruit, the\niso-called high prices for our fruit\nlands are reasonable, indeed.\n"In my opinion, every fruit or\nchard in th\'s valley is worth more\ntoday than it was before the\nf or the simple reason that local men\n1 clearly demonstrated during these\nj freezes that the fruit, crop can be\n! ea8 (]y saved by smudging, and the\nknowledge that such can be done\nmakes every orchard In the valley\nmore valuable than It was before.\n"It has alRo been proven by this\ndemonstratlon that the growers will\nnot be put to any great expense to\nprotect their crops."\n- ; -\nBRADY ON PRIMARY LAW.\n-\nCharacteristic of the man.

I want the Borough Street rail\nway\'s franchise granted, and I want\nthe franchise to lie perpetual."\n"But 1 don\'t see what your driving\nat. If you Intend to merge the Borough\nStreet railway with your own City Sur\nface line Its charter will become void."\n"I don\'t mean to merge them. I own\nboth roads, and I run them separately."\n"The-you do!"\n"That\'s a little surprise, eh? I\nhaven\'t made any parade of It. I Just\nwent quiotly to work, through Gibbs,\nand bought up a majority of the Bor\nough stock. Now don\'t you see how\nthe granting of the franchise and the\nnews that I control the road will work\nWhen they are mnde known?"\n"Bore! It\'ll send that stock sky\nUgh. You\'ll scoop In a million or two."\n"A million or two!" echoed Wain\nwrlght scornfully. "Nearer"—\n"Hold on!" Interrupted Horrlgan.\n"What\'s that noise?"\nHe had Jumped to his feet with an\nalacrity that was surprising In so large\na man and was listening Intently.\n"That clicking?" asked Walnwrlght.\n-Oh. that\'s only the private wire In my\nattce."\n"Private wire?

"That\'s all right, but what I\n(Want to know is, How does all this\nseo c etn me?"\nHorrlgan threw himself back In his\niChalr, nptllted cigar In one corner of\n■h mouth, thumbs in waistcoat arm\njholeo and eyed his host quizzically.\niWalnwrlght did not even pretend not\nJto understand. Still, Instead of giving\n* direct answer he went on with seem\ning Irrelevance:\n*T am a public spirited citizen. I be\nHere civic welfare would suffer by any\n«tenge In municipal administration, so\nAn keep the present party In power I\nan willing to donate to It $200,000 to\nelectlon expenses."\n"That sounds pretty good as far as It\nmaybe you didn\'t hear some\n: asked you a minute ago. What\nHow does «U this\nconcern me?"\n"I\'m coming to that. As I said, 1\nam a public spirited citizen. I\'m also\na good friend—such a good friend that\nI\'m always glad to put my friends on\nto anything in the market that looks\nparticularly promising. Suppose I car\nry for your account at the market\nprice (that\'s 63 Just now) 15,000 shares\nof Borough 8treet railway stock ?"\n"Well?\'\'\n"If that franchise Is granted. Bor\nough stock will go up at least 25 points\nwithin two days. That would clear up\nfor you a profit of—let\'s see—about\n$375,000."\nIlorrigun had pulled a pencil from\nhis pocket and was figurlug on the\nback of an envelope.\n"Yes," lie said at last; "that\'s right,\n$375,000. That would he my profit,\nwhile yours would run Into the mil\nlions. That\'s not warm enough friend\nship for me."\n"Surely, that Is n generous"—\n"Generous, maybe, but I\'d like some\nthing munificent—say 25,000 shares nt\n63. Then nt the 25 point Jump I\'d\nmake—I\'d make"—consulting his fig\nures on the envelope—"something over\nkGiXi.OOO. That sounds better to me.\nHey?"\n"But Mr. Horrlgan"—\n"You\'ve got my terms. TRke \'em or\nleave \'em."\n"Oh, very well," conceded Waln\nwright, with lame grnciousness. "Any\nthing to oblige an old friend."\n"Good! So we get $200,000 for elec\ntion expenses, and my personal ac\ncount receives 25,000 shares at G3."\n"Quite so. And now"—\n"And now comes the question of the\nright man for mayor. We"—\nAgain Horrlgan paused, rising to his\nfeet stealthily, like some ponderous\ncat, his head bent slightly, as though\ncatching a faint or distant sound.\n"What\'s the matter?" asked Waln\nwrlght, looking up.\n"Nothing," returned Horrlgan. But\nhe did not resume his sent. Instead as\nhe talked he began to pace the room In\napparent aimlessness, yet every turn\nchanced to bring him nearer and near\ner to the door of the adjoining office.\n"You sec," he said, "we must have\nthe right man.\nIf we don\'t, we\nhaven\'t a shad\now of a show\ntowin. We mush\nbe careful to\nchoose the best\nmauposslble. In\nfact, Mr. Watn\nwrlght — In\nfact"—\nHis wander\nin g s had\nbrought him to\nthe office door.\nWith the last\nword he aud\n*\n7\nThompson stepped\nquietly over the\nthreshold.\ndenly jerked It o$en.\nThompson stepped quietly over the\nthreshold Into the library, walked over\nto bis employer, banded him a dispatch\nand went out again under the battery\nof Horrigan\'B glare, closing the office\ndoor after him.\n"That fellow was listening to every\nword we said!" shouted the boas as\nthe door shut behind Thompson.\n"How foolish yon are!" protested\nWalnwrlght "He was bringing me\nthis message. I\'ve tried and tempted\nand tested Thompson in a hundred\nways, and he\'s always rung true. I\ntrust him utterly."\n"Well, I don\'t trust a man living,"\nretorted Horrlgan, reluctantly convinc\ned. "1 don\'t sign receipts or keep ac\ncounts or write letters or have wit\nnesses when I tage. T always make it\na question of veracity between me and\nthe other man if there\'s an Investiga\ntion. My word\'s as good as any one\'s,\nand they can\'t prove anything against\nme In case of s showdown. I advise\nyou to try the same plan. . It\'s a good\none. And In the meantime if I were\nyou I\'d keep an eye on that secretary.\nHe*H bear watching."\n"Never mind about Thompson. He\'s\nall right Let\'s get back to the elec\ntion. Who have you In mind for\nmayor?"\n"Well," considered Horrlgan, "he\'s\ngot to be some one who isn\'t mixed up\nin politics or corporations. Some one\nthe public Isn\'t on to. A man with no\nqueer past."\n"I advise you to consult the calen\ndar of saints aud pick out your candi\ndate there," sneered Walnwrlght, who\ncould not clearly follow his guest\'s rea\nsoning.\n"No. I think I can find him on\nearth." laughed Horrlgan. "He\'s got\nto be youug, clever, educated, with a\ngood name, a good family and social\nstanding and plenty of cash. The cash\nIs Important, so the public will under\nstand he Isn\'t a graft bnnter. They\'ve\ngot to be made to think he\'s In the\ngame for purity of politics and high\nprinciples and love of civic duty and\nall that sort of thing. At the same\ntime he\'s got to be some one we can\nbandle to suit ourselves. That\'s the\nman who\'ll catch \'em coming and go\ning. We\'ve got to find him. Any sug\ngestions?"\n"Well, how about Gibbs?"\n"Won\'t do. Broker and money Jug\ngler.

And, besides, be\nwears a monocle. What\'d happen If he\nwas to flash that monocle In a Fourth\nward meeting? There\'d be a massa\ncre."\n"Well, who, then? Have you any\none In mind?"\n"Yes," assented Horrlgan, "I have.\nDo you happen to know a young fel\nlow who spends his summers near here\n—a chap named Bennett—Alwyn Ben\nnett?"\n"Certainly; I know him well. But"—\n"Well, how does he strike you?"\n"I\'d never have thought of him In\nsuch a connection."\n"Why wouldn\'t you? He pretty near\nfulfills all our qualifications. Besides,\nhis father used to be a big man in the\norganization. Got some fat contracts\nfrom It in his time too."\n"But young Bennett has never"—\n"He\'s well off, well educated, clever,\nand all that. I ran across him last fall\nwhen he came over to help Lorlmer In\nhis fight In the Fourteenth. He made\nsome rattling good speeches, and the\nboys all took a liking to him. A swell,\nbut not a snob; good mixer, good fel\nlow, popular, clear headed, no past—\nyes, he\'s our man. More I think It over\nthe surer I am."\n"1 shouldn\'t wonder If you\'re right.\nIIow would you like to talk It over\nwith him now?"\n"Now?"\n"Yes. He\'s still around the place\nsomewhere, I think."\nWainwright rang a bell, and the but\nler appeared.\n"Find Mr. Bennett," said the finan\ncier, "and ask him If he will step here\nfor a moment."\n"Yes." went on Horrlgan reflectively,\nruDoing ms nuge piump nands togeth\ner, "he\'s the man for us—that . Is," he\nadded, with less assurance, "If we can\nhandle him."\n"I think we can," answered Waln\nwrlght, a fragment of his conversation\nwith Gibbs flashing across his mem\nory. "You see, I have fairly good rea\nsons for believing he\'s in love with my\nniece. Miss Dallas Wainwright."\n"So? That\'s"—\n"And, as I control her fortune and\nher brother\'s until Perry is twenty\nfive"—\n"Oh, it\'s a cinch!" chuckled Horrl\ngan. "He"— ~\n"Mr. Bennett is playing tennis," re\nported the butler, coming to the door.\n"He will be here jit once."\n"Now," resumed Horrlgan, "the only\nthing that remains is to find out if\nhe\'ll consent, and then"—\n"You wanted me, Mr. Walnwrlght?"\nasked Bennett, stepping through the\nlong window from the veranda. "Oh,\ngood morning, Mr. Horrlgan," be added\non seeing the second occupant of the\nfoom.\nThe young man was coatless and col\nlarless, his silk shirt being turned In at\nthe neck. In one band he swung a ten\nnis racket. With the other be mopped\nhis flushed face, for the day was hot\nand the game had been swift\n"Yes," answered Walnwrlght "I\'m\nsorry to interrupt your tennis set but\nwe want to see you on a rather impor\ntant matter. We\'ve been talking about\nyou."\n"Thanks!" said Bennett with a puz\noled smile from one to the other of the\ntwo older men. "What about?"\n"Want to be mayor?"\'queried Horri\ngan abruptly.\n"What\'s the answer?" countered the\nperplexed youth. •\n"It Isn\'t a Joke," Intervened Waln\nwrlght. "Mr. Horrlgan is In earnest.*\'\n"In earnest? I hope the heat hasn\'t\ngone to his head."\n"You don\'t understand," put In Hor\nrigan. "1 control the party\'s nomina\ntions. The nomination for mayor Is\nyours If you\'ll like It."\n"Not—not really?" gasped Alwyn\naghast\n"Yes, really. We"—\n"But, with a whole organization full\nof good material, why do you come to\nme?\'\'\n"Because you\'re the man we want."\ntfAs an answer that\'s excellent, but\nas an explanation It\'s mystifying."\n"I\'ll tell you. We\'re looking forward\nto a risky fight and"—\n"And since you see no chance of\nwinning you pick me out as the victim\ninstead of some organization man?\nGood idea as far as you\'re concerned,\nbut I beg to decline, without thanks."\n"No. no!" corrected Walnwrlght.\n"Mr. Horrlgan thinks that you have a\nStrong chance of winning."\n"That\'s right," corroborated the boss.\n"It\'ll be a hard fight, but with the right\nman we\'ll win, and we believe you\'re\nthe right man.

Was this\nthe chance—the chance he had so eager\nly longed for? It seemed providential.\nHis face alight with the Joy of battle\nand the hope of bis heart\'s reward,\nBennett turned upon the waiting boss.\n"I accept"\n"Good!" yelled Horrlgan, slapping\nhim resoundingly on the back. "Good\nboy ! Now,\nwe\'ll"—\n. "But remem\nber one thing,\nMr. Horrlgan,"\nInterrupted Ben\nnett, and his\ncareless boy\nhood seemed to\nbave fallen\naway from him\nlike a discarded\ngarment, leav\ning the man\nhood and rug\nged strength\nstripped of all\nthe follies and Idleness that had hither\nto masked It, "remember one thing, if\nI win this fight—if I am elected mayor\n—I shall never once swerve from my\nsolemn oath of office.
