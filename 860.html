        <pre>['THE WALLACE MINER\nVol. 2, No. 34\nWALLACE, IDAHO, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1908\nFive Cents a Copy\nE. M. Smith Disposes of Tungsten Mine\nAfter Developing it 16 Years\nI\nOne of the two mines on the north side known to have tungsten, a\nvaluable ore, in it9 ledges, is the Golden Winnie Tungsten Mining dr\nMilling company, the other is the Golden Chest.\nThe former is situated on Prichard creek, two miles below Murray\nand oh the right of way of the Idaho Northern.\n1893 by E. M. Smith, who has worked in the property continuously\nsince. The ledge was first discovered by float below it, and was first\nworked for the free milling gold found in the quartz.\nTen years ago a ten-stamp mill was erected on the property by\nCharles Swain and Mr. Smith. The cost of construction was $25,000,I\nand it was operated successfully for about three months when it was[\nhorned down. It was supposed that a rat hit a match near some oily\nwaste ahd ignited it. The mill was not rebuilt. However, some time\nlater, Mr. Smith erected a small mill, run by water power, and installed\nan "Araata," to grind out the gold. Working alone, taking out the ore\nfrom the Golden Winnie during the day and sleeping by the side of the\nIt was discovered in\narasta at night, and getting up every few hours and throwing in fifty\npounds of ore, one month Mr. Smith made a cleanup of nearly $800.00.\nHe noticed a heavy deposit of brown sand in the bottom of the mill and\ncursed it righteously, as it was very hard and caused him much trouble\nin operation.\nlie shoveled out the Unknown rock by the ton, but did not know\nthat he could have marketed it for $000 to $800. It was a rich grade\nof tungsten.\nIVhril he discovered from an assayer what valuable mineral he had\nIn large quantities, he was sick at heart to think he had thrown away\na fortune and did\'not know it.\nThat was three years ago, and since that time Mr. Smith has had\nseveral chances to dispose of his property. A year ago he gave an op\ntion but it was not taken up, and this summer Arthur Amon, of Ken\nnewick, Wash., took an option on the mine. The first payment ac\ncording to Agreement was made this week. It is not known what sum\nMr. Smith Will receive for his tungsten mine but it is learned from a\nreliable source that it is ndt less than $75,000 in cash, retaining con\nsiderable stock in the company.\nMr. Amon is to arrive from Washington October 10, and begin op\nerations at once, developing the mine, and erecting a concentrating\nplant for the tungsten. There is an excellent millsite near the portal\nef the working tunnel, and as the property is crossed by the Idaho Nor\nthern, shipping facilities will be good. An abundance of water power\ngoes with the property to operate the mill and compressor.\nIn developing the mine Mr. Smith drifted on the lead, following\nthe many windings and crooks the ledge made. It was faulted more or\nless but it was never lost. Ten or more upraises were made and chutes\nput in, so that the stoping and taking out of ore can be commenced at!\nanytime. The face of the tunnel is in over 600 feet, and the ore is\nfully four feet wide and seems to be getting wider as depth is gained,\nThe quartz, in which the tungsten is found, also carries values in gold,\nenough for treating the ore.\nMr. Smith is to he manager of the mine for one year. When asked\nwhat he would do then he said; "Buy a ticket to Japan, and from there\nto Egypt. I will have enough money to spend the rest of my life\ntraveling and I think that I have earned a rest as I have worked in that\nhole There for fifteen years during the best part of my life.\ngo\n> >\nCLEAR GRIT STARTS UP AGAIN\nWork started this week on the\nClear Grit, located a mile and one\nhalf from Delta.

In driving the low\ner tunnel a number of kidneys of\nsolid ore were found. The ledge in\nthis tunnel had faulted but has been\npicked up again. The main cross\ncut tunnel is in over 300 feet and\nhas struck the genuine Burke quartz\nite.

Willis is president\nand secretary, and Charles \\V. Cole is treasurer, both residents\nof Boston.\nThe company owns a group of eleven placer claims, all con\ntiguous. The property was formerly known as the Mother Lode.\nThere is a ten-stamp mill on the property, which is sometimes\noperated by leasers. This year lhiu Sieger ran nine tons of tire\nthrough the mill, averaging $103 a ton. The ore in the Mother\nLode is now getting base, but over $1,000,003 has been produced\nfrom this property. The ledge is quartz and is four feet wide.\n\'\nHan Immense Tunnel\nBig Bore 7000 Feet Long to Tap Bear\nTop and Other Properties\n-\nA tunnel 7000 feet in length, running through the mountain in a\nstraight line and tapping the Bear Top mine, the Chicago-London, the\nBlack Horse, the Paragon, the Jewel group and the Orofmo, is what lias\nbeen suggested by a number connected with these properties. The por-,\ntal of the tunnel would be within a few hundred feet of the Idaho Nor\nthem railroad, and on an excellent site for a large mill, which could\nbuilt to handle all of the ores from these mines.\nI\nThe P\' an feasible and may some day be carried out. It has\nalready been seriously considered by several of the larger companies,\nWhile the cost of the tunnel would be about $75,000, it is not mi\nlikely that blind leads would be struck, which if worked, would more\'\nthan pay for the cost of the work. The hill is known to be well tilled\nwith large ore shoots, and it is believed that there are many more in the\nhill that nothing is known about yet. |\n-\n)\nj\nSide, the Orofino is considered by experienced mining men to Ik*, a pro- 1\nducer of the near future. In fact, considerable galena has boon taken |\nout in development and piled on the dump. Experts have estimated\nthat in the large ore shoot on the property there is now $80,000 worth\njof ore blocked out, ready to be mined and shipped.\nThe Orofino joins the Bear Top on the south and is about three miles\nfrom the Idaho Northern railroad.

And\nbis high spirits\nreturned, and he\n■talked back to\nthe fireplace,\nchaffing CI a 1\nborne and warn\ning blm against\never again flgbt\n3 lug under an un\nClaiborne hauled up known banner.\n"Here they\nare," called Claiborne and flung open\nthe door as Shirley, her father and\nBaron von Marhof rode up under the\nbillowing ensign. Dick stepped out to\nmeet them and answer their questions.\n"Mr. Arinltage la here. He baa been\nhurt, and we hnve scut for a doctor,\nand he looked at Shirley.\n"If you will do me the honor to enter\n—all of you!" And Armltage came out\nquickly and smiled upon them.\n"We had aturted off\' to look for Dick\nwhen we met your man." said Shirley,\nstanding on the steps, rein In band.\n"What haa happened, and how was\nArmltage Injured?" demanded Judge\nClaiborne.\n"There waa a battle," replied Dick,\ngrinning, "and Mr. Armltage got ln-tbe\nway of a bullet."\nner ride through the keen morning\nair had flooded Shirley\'s cheek with\ncolor. She had been awake much of\nthe night On returning from the ball\nat the Inn she found Dick still absent,\nand when at 0 o\'clock he Iwd not re\nturned ahe called her father, nnd they\nhad set off together for the hills, to\nward which, the stableman reported,\nDick bad. ridden. They had met Os\ncar just outside the Springs and had\nreturned to tbe hotel for Baron von\nMarhof. Having performed her office\nas guide and satisfied herself that Dick\nwas safe, she felt her conscience eased\nand could see no reason why she should\nnot ride home and leave tbe inen to\ntheir council. Armltage saw her turn\nto her horse, whose nose was exploring\nher mackintosh pockets, and he stepped\nquickly toward her.\n"You see, Miss Claiborne, your broth\ner la quite safe, but I very much hope\nyou will not run away. There are\nsome things to be explained which It\nonly fair you should hear."\n"Walt, Shirley, and we will all go\ndown together," aald Judge Claiborne\nreluctantly.\nBaron von Marhof, very handsome\nand distinguished, but mud splashed,\nhad tied his horse to a post in tbe\ndriveway and stood on tbe veranda\nsteps, his hat In his hand, staring,\nlook of bewilderment on bis face. Ar\nmltage, bareheaded, still In bla riding\nleggings, his trousers splashed with\nmud, his left arm aleeveleas and sup\nported by a handkerchief swung from\nhis neck, shook hands with Judge Clai\nborne.\n"Baron von Marhof, allow me to pre\nsent Mr. Armltage," said Dick, and Ar\nmltage walked to the atepa and bowed.\nThe ambassador did not offer his band.\n"Won\'t you pleaae come In?" said\nArmltage, amlllng upon them, and\nwhen they were seated he took his\nstand by the fireplace, hesitated a mo\nment, as though weighing his words,\nand began;\n"Baron von Marhof, the events that\nhave led to this meeting have been\nsomewhat more than unusual—they are\nunique And complications have arisen\nwhich require prompt and wise action.\nFor this reason I am glad that we shall\nhave the benefit of Judge Claiborne\'s\nadvice."\n"Judge Claiborne is tbe counsel of\nour embassy," said the ambaasador.\nHis gase was flxed intently on Arml\nluge\'s face, and be hitched himself for\nward In his chair impatiently, grasp\ning his crop nervously across his knees.\n"You were anxious to find me, baron,\nand 1 may have seemed hard to catch,\nhut I believe we have been working at\ncross purposes to serve the same in\nterests."\nThe beron nodded.\n"Yes; I dare eay." be remarked dryly.\n"And some other gentlemen of not\nquite your own standing have et tbe\nsame time been seeking me.

He was very bitter against\nme. It was only a few hours before he\nwas killed as a part of the Wlnkel\nried conspiracy. He bad given his life\nfor Austria. He told me never to see\nblm again, never to claim my own\nname, until I had done Something for\nAustria.

It is to take advantage of these conditions that this syndicate is being formed.\nIt is proposed to organize subsidiary companies for the varied interests to be acquired. Every year hundreds of mining\ncompanies are formed and their shares sold world wide. In almost all of these corporations from one-half to two-thirds of\nthe stock is retained by the promoters, and it is the purpose of this syndicate to itself become the promoter, thus saving for\nsyndicate shareholders this large interest and increasing the value of their interests by the amount so retained. It is unneccs- 9\nsary to dwell on the enormous profits that may be made in mining. By the employment of only the most reliable engineers\nand practical experts, in conjunction with ample capital to carry on development, this syndicate expects to bo in position to\nreturn reasonable profits to its shareholders from this source.\nTo persons living in old established and well settled communities, where opportunities for quick returns from invest\nment are limited, except when accompanied by great risk, the possibilities in the West must appear fabulous. Railroad build\ning is being rapidly pushed in all sections, and large areas of almost uninhabited territory are being constantly opened up for\nsettlement and put in close touch with city markets. At the present time the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul line to the Pacific\ncoast is being built through this district; the Idaho-Northern Company is building an independent line from the 0. It. & N.\nlines through a section of the Coeur d'Alencs heretofore without transportation facilities, and in addition several lines of\nElectric Railway are projected. Agricultural land opened up by these lines may now be bought for a few dollars an acre,\nand history proves that such lands increase hundred fold in value in an incredibly short period. Available sites for building\ntowns may also be procured at low cost, to be sold at greatly enhanced values. The possibilities for profits in this field are\napparent.\nIt is a fact known to every person of average intelligence that the supply of timber in the United States is being\nrapidly devastated. In Idaho, Montana and other western states the finest bodies of standing timber remain. It is not\ninfrequent in the Coeur d'Alene district to find mineral claims with a supply of high grade saw timber more than sufficient\nto pay the cost of getting title to the land from the United States government. Here is likewise a profitable source for in\nvestment.\nWhile a great deal of railroad building is being carried on, there remain many opportunities for the construction of\nindependent lines, tapping districts where immense tonnage can be obtained and where motive power may be cheaply de\nveloped from the numerous mountain streams contiguous. From this source also power may be developed for mining and\ncommercial purposes at exceedingly low cost, and companies formed to utilize this product would form another source of\nfor the Coeur d'Aleuc Syndicate. Industrial projects of many other kinds will become necessary with the develop\nment of the district, each bringing its quota of profit to shareholders of the syndicate.\nRead the above unquestionable statements again, and then, if you are not sure of your own judgment, consult your busi-'\nness associates before investing in these share*\nor, generally speaking—to use the funds of this syndi\n: -r.\nrevenue\nSubscriptions are limited to ten (10)\nSubscriptions will be received for two thousand (2,000) shares of stock at par value of one hundred dollars ($100) per share,\nshares for each individual.

Every person\nholding stock in Coeur d\'Alene mining properties and every person resi\ndent in the district is interested in the outcome of all such suits. As\nour readers very well know, the Bunker Hill is the greatest lead mine in\nthe world. It has disbursed dividends exceeding $10,000,000 and is be\nlieved to have a comfortable reiierve in cash. It is completing a mill of,\n1000-ton capacity to concentrate its lower grade product, practically\ndoubling its capacity and promising an Increase in its working force of\napproximately 500 men. The Federal company is a Wall Street corpor\nation with Standard Oil and Guggenheim affiliations. It owns some of\nthe best known and oldest producers in the district, among them being\nthe Tiger-Poor man at Burke, Standard-Mammoth at Mace, Morning at\nMullan and Last Chance at Wardner, employing about 1100 men.\nThe notice of suit by the Federal company coming so shortly after the\ncontrol of the republican county convention by that corporation led F.\nW. Bradley, president of the B. H. & S. to make the charge that the\nextraordinary activity of the Federal company in local politics had a\nI waring on suits now pending or contemplated. It is the vigorous deni\nal of this charge by Frank T. Post, attorney for the Federal company,\nupon which we wish to comment.\nThe editor of TnE Miner has known Mr. Post for five years and in\ncommon with all others has had the highest respect for him as a gentle\nman and a man of great attainment in his profession. It is disappoint\ning indeed to read his reply refuting the chares of Mr. Bradley.\nHe enters Into a general condemnation of the B. H. & 8. Co. which is\nabsurd because the company had no interest in the case he cites, never\nhad owned the ground, which was in possession of United States Sena\ntor Jonathan Bourne of Oregon, who has been developing the property\nfor many years. But the portion of Mr. Post\'s tirade to which we take\nespecial exception is the following paragraph:\n• "I do not know anything about Shoshone county pol\nities, but this: That Stanly Easton and a lot of other ser\nvants of Fred Bradley are active in politics there and I\npresume that employes of The Federal Mining & Smelting\ncompany may also take an interest in them, as all good\nAmerican citizens ought to do. But the statement that\n. the company is attempting to influence court decisions is\nmalicious and false, and Fred Bradley knows it to lie so.\nn\nAnv one conversant with local conditions will agree with Mr. Post\nthat lie does not know anything about Shoshone county polities; and\nwe would not quote the paragraph were it not for the remarks which he\nmakes about Mr. Easton. The word servant is, of course, perfectly\npermissible if used correctly, as every officer or employe of a company\nis a servant of that company—but he is not necessarily a servant of the\npresident of that company—and Mr. Easton i9 not, nor is it expected\nof him. The B. H. & S. is conducted differently from the Federal\ncompany, as Mr. Post can easily verify if he desires to. The remark,of\nMr. Post, therefore, is insulting, it is apparently meant to be insulting\nand in consequence we deplore it os beneath his dignity both as a gentle\nman and as un attorney. Let us make a further analysis of what Mr.\nPost says and of the conditions that actually existed at the Republican\nCounty Convention. If© intimates that Mr. Easton and others of the\nB. H. & 8. Co. are perniciously active in politics, while the Federal\ncompany\'s employes are only moved by the high sense of patriotism\nthat always d.stinguishes this corporation and its officers and is so well\nknown to all that to mention it is superfluous—we might say ridiculous.\nWell compare the results of this pernicious activity on one hand and\nhigh minded sense of duty on the other hand: The pernicious activity\nof "Stanly Easton and other servants of Fred Bradley" resulted in the\nelection of four or live employes of the B. H. A S.
