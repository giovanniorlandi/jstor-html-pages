Editor\nJohn Mitchell, Jr., informed the\nofficer that prompt service would be\nthe result and that he would get in\ntouch with the officials of that organ\nization. A telephone call to the Sixth\nMt. Zion Baptist Church, where the\nGrand Council is in session, brought\nimmediate action and he was soon\ninformed by Deputy J. S. Collins\nthat Mrs. Maggie L. Walker had sent\na special committee to look after the\nman.\nThe committee consisted of J. S.\n’Collins, John H. Wade, T. T. Sparks,\nF. D. Lee. They were well received\nI at the headquarters and at once\nushered into the enclosure where sat\nan elderly man, with a gray\nmoustache. He was thought to be\nslightly demented. He had on his\nperson a watch and $20.00 in money.\nHe said he had a nephew, Lewis Ellis,\nJiving at 1420 Q Street, N. W., Wash-\'\ning-ton. At times he said the number\nwas 1429 Q Street, N. W., Washing\nton, D. C. When asked about the St.\nLuke Order, he said that he was not a\nmember of the Order, although he\nfhad at one time owned $20.00 worth\nof stock in one of its enterprises.\nI He was surprised to know that he.\n\\was in Richmond, Va., and he could\nnot understand just how he got here.\nHe said His name was James Jack\nson. He has a nephew named Lewis\nj Ellis. The final up-shot of the whole\nmatter was that Detective J. L.\nWiltshire put him on a train bound\nTor Washington. He evidently had a\nlc-atchel for he enquired about one.\n(He was put in charge of the porter.\nAs for the St. Luke’s committee, it\nstood ready to render any assistance\nnecessary and expressed thanks that\nthe matteer had been brought to the\nattention of the officials.\ni _ i\nh 1\ni DO YOU KNOW THEM?\n- j\nInformation has been received by\nthe Police Headquarters, Major R.\nP..

Arthur D. Hill, before th? Su\ny.vmc Judicial Court of Massachu\nsetts, in session in Boston this week,\nis one of the ablest deliverances ever\nnr: -nted to a legal tribunal upon\nthe fundamental principles of law\nas related to the life and liberty of\na citizen who is charged with a capi\ntal offense. He recently entered the\ncase of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo\nVanzetti, condemned to die for the\nmurder of a paymaster and his guru-1\nin South Braintree on April 15,\n1920.\nUnder the Massachusetts statut-\\\nI the Court of Appeals deals only with\nthe question of law and not witn\nthe question of fact. That is to say,\nif all of the strict legal niceties and\nrequirements have been complied\nwith, even though material facts\nshould afterwards justify the renew,\nthe higher court is powerless to deal\nwith them. The primary charge made\nby this distinguished attorney is that\nhis clients had to face a jurist, who\nwas impregnated with prejudice on\naccount of the fact that these two\nmen (Italians) were Anarchists.\nThis phase of the case was empha\nsized in the celebrated Lunenburg\ncase, which was heard in Virginia\nmore than a decade ago. The dis\ntinguished father of the well-known\njurist, Judge R. Carter Scott, enun\nciated the principle that the highest\npurpose of government was the pro\ntection of human life and in extreme\ncases to subserve this purpose, legal\ntechnicalities should be set aside. By\na ruling of the Supreme Court of\nVirginia, this view was overruled and\nlater it was adopted as a fundamen\ntal ruling of the Supreme Court, for\nin order to protect the prisoners\nfrom lynching, the Supreme Court\ntook actual, bodily possession of the\nprisoners and they were held in the\nRichmond city jail, subject to the\ndirect order of that supreme tribu\nnal.\nThis was the first and only case\nof the kind ever recorded in the\nlegal annals of this State and we\nbelieve is without a precedent in any\nother State. The prisoners, being\nwithout counsel, had no exceptions\nfiled and the records of the Lunen\nburg County Court, Judge Orgain\npresiding, was virtually a blank page\nso far as these particular prisoners\nwere concerned.\nHon. George D. Wise, Judge Hen\nry W. Flournoy and Captain A. B.\nGuigon represented the prisoners.\nThere can be no sympathy in this\ncountry for Anarchists, who believe\nin the destruction of all organized\ngovernment, and who regard murder\nand arson as a legitimate means of\nwaging underhanded warfare, but\neven this should not justify us in\ntaking unwise action in polluting the\nfountain head of justice, certainly\nnot in summary executions, until we\nhave declared an “open season” for\nthis class of people, outlawed them\nand given notice that their residence\nin this country is undesirable and\nthey shall not be permitted to either\nenter or to remain here.\nSpeaking of the .difference be\ntween Massachusetts’ legal practices\nand Virginia legal methods, the Rich\nmond, Va., Times-Dispatch gives ut\nterance to the best deliverance that\nwe have read upon that subject,\nwhen in its issue, of the 18th in\nstant it says:\nif the public mind ri not confused\nas to the immediate status of the\nf\'aecc-Vanzetti case, it is because the\npublic mind is long of memory and\nkeen of perception. From inquiries\nreceived by The Times-Dispatch, and\nno doubt by other newspapers,, it ap\npears that the impression is general\nthat the hearing of bills of excep\ntions by the full bench of the Su\npreme Court of Massachusetts indi\ncates that Sacco and Vanzetti will\nhave a new trial. Perhaps they will,\nbut the fact that Justice Sanderson\nreferred the whole matter to all the\njustices, sitting “en banque,” does\nnot necessarily indicate that a new\ntrial will be granted.\nBeginning only with developments\nof the last few months the procedure\nin the case has been that Judge\nThayer, the trial judge, was asked to\nset his former sentence—and the\nverdict preceding the sentence—\naside on the ground that he had dis\nplayed prejudice against the accused\nmen, and on other grounds. Judge\nThayer refused to grant this mo\ntion. Incidentally, in Virginia—\nthanks be!—a judge who had been\ncharged with prejudice would almost\ncertainly have declined to sit. Still,\nJudge Thayer stood his ground and\nRefused the motion. So far as the\ntrial court was concerned, then, the\ncase was ended.\nThen counsel for Sacco and Van\nzetti appealed to Justice Sanderson,\nof the Supreme Court of Massachu\nsetts, to grant a writ of error. That,\nif it had been granted, would have\nmeant that Justice Sanderson con\nsidered there was enough probabil\nity of error in the lower court to\nwarrant the Supreme Court in say\ning to the lower court, in effect:\n“We arc not sure about this thing;\nwe’ll hear it ourselves.” Justice San\nderson refused to grant this writ of\nerror. The result was the case was\nwhere it had been all along.\nUnder the law ot Virginia, any\njudge of the Supreme Court of Ap\npeals may grant a writ of error—\nthat is, a certificate saying the case\nought to be heard by the appellate\ncourt. Under the practice of our\nCourt of Appeals, three judges of\nthe five must join in refusing a writ\nof error. Anyhow, counsel for Sac\nco and Vanzetti filed another plead\ning, whatever it is called, before\nJustice Sanderson in which it was\nalleged that he had been in error in\nrefusing a writ of error. Justice\nSanderson might have insisted that\nhe was in error, or he might have\nadmitted that he was in error. In\nthe latter case, the course of the\nlower court, Judge Thayer’s, would\nhave been certified to the Supreme\nCourt of Massachusetts for such ac\ntion as might be within its juris\ndiction.\nBut, presumably because of the\nimportance of the case, Justice San\nderson was unwilling to pass on the\nifcharge that he had been in error\nwhen he refused to grant a writ of\nerror to the accused men. And he\nSubmitted the justice and propriety\nof his own ruling to the full bench\ntof the Supreme Court of Massachu\nsetts. If the full bench sustains his\nopinion, the case will end. If it re\nverses him, it will mean, not neces\nsarily that, there will be a new tri&l\nfor Sacco and Vanzetti, but that the\nSupreme Court of Massachusetts will\ndecide whether there will or will not\nbo a new trial. Just at this mo\nment, then, the Supreme Court of\nMassachusetts is considering whether\nit will sustain the decision of Jus\ntice Sanderson or give ear to the\nplea of counsel for Sacco and Van\nzetti.\nMl.

But worst of ail, these may\nactually be the symptoms\' of simple\nanaemia—thatvdreaJ of\nten suffered by women.\nThere’s nothing so good as Mc\nCoy’s Tablets" to put on firm flesh,\nround out face- and figure and build\nup rich, red blood.\nSo if you need a few pounds of\nflesh to round out the hollows, if\nyou want to get back old-time energy\nand health, get a box of McCoy’s\nTablets today. Just a short treat\nment will make you look and feel\nlike a, new person.\nMcCoy takes all the ri°k—R°ad\nthis ironclad guarantee. If after\ntaking 4 sixty cent boxes of McCoy’s\nTablets or 2 One Dollar boxes any\nthin, underweight man or woman\ndoesn’t gain at least 5 pounds and\nfeel completely satisfied with the\nmarked improvement in health—\nyour druggist is authorized to return\nthe purchase price.\nThe name McCoy’s Cod Liver Oil\nTablets has been shortened—just\nask for McCoy’s Tablets at any drug\nstore in America.\nFULTON NOTES\nThe Pev.

I\nto get a now\nFor tfto\nBoard, heretofore regarded fey faithful\nfollower* ao establishing for all ttana\nthe gospel of what Jo fit and proper\nto eat, is not fixed and Irrevocable\ndoctrine\' after all I\nDr. Alonzo E. Taylor, one of the two\nsurviving members of the board to\nwhich President Roosevelt referred\nquestionable food Ingredients, follow\ning the passage of the federal pure\nfood law In 1906, himself denies the\nfinality of the findings of that body\nand holds that Its rulings should be\nchanged or modified to fit any new\nfacts or discoveries that advancing\nscience may establish. In this he\nsupports Dr. Charles A. Browne, Chief\nof the U. 8. Bureau of Chemistry,\nwhose recent statements that new\nand continuing studies should be\nmade of preservatives and adulter\nants, to determine their effect on the\nvitamins, etc., brought a storm of\nprotest and objection from food In\nterests which feared they might be\nadversely affected.\n8cience, Dr. Taylor says, never\ncloses its doors on new knowledge,\nand the Remsen Board’s rulings, he\ndeclares, closed none. The Board, he\nstates, studied a given problem In\nthe light of Information and knowl\nedge available at the time Its Investi\ngations were made — from 1908 to\n1914—and Its findings were based on\nthose factors. He\'holds It would be\nfoolish to saj^ that the findings of\nthat Board preclude later studies of\nnew factors affecting nutrition, such\nas vitamins, frj Instance, or the pos\nsible effect/ Upon them of preserva\ntives or other Ingredients. Mo mem\nber of the Board, Dr. Taylor states,\n»nni the lmwdienti at questton\n■Ms wholesomenees which were\n■todltd by the Bemsen Board were:\n■ulgte dioxide and sulphites, ben\n0& Alonzo b T/jyicAi,\nzoate of soda and benzoic acid, alum,\nsaccharine and sulphate of copper.\nOf these Dr. Taylor says hard\nlimits were recommended on sulnhur\ndioxide and less stringent limitations\non benzoic acid: alum, after much\nstudy, was passed for use In bakine\npowders and In crisping pickles; cop\nper was thrown out entirely and he\nfeel3 that the action of the Board on\nthat count has btj^ /ylly Justified\nHie nrsenat\'s r.-.i lead v ::•? rej.c,..!\nwithout any lnvccti^otiju, the 2oa;J\nfMliiff that public m wall u aclen\ntllle knowledge condemned them aa\nunlit far use In foods. Saccharine,\nwhich he states was found to be a\nmost difficult subject, was wholly\nbanned as to foodstuffs.\nThe desirability of new studies, In\nDr. Taylor’s opinion, may not always\nbe based on a need for new restric\ntions; developing science may show\nthe advantage of dropping certain\nrestrictions already Imposed as well\nas imposing new safeguards.\nWhat is to be regarded as toxic, he\nsays. Is often difficult to define and\nsometimes changes with time. Twenty\nyears ago. for Instance, a salt manu\nfacturer cdeling an Iodide to table\nsalt would have exposed himself to\nthe charge of adulteration; now a\nreasonable case could be made out In\nfavor of the presence of Iodide la\ntable salt.\nA suggestion, twenty years ago. that\nnitrite might be used directly In the\ncuring of meat would certainly have\naroused scientific opposition; today it\nIs recognizen pracrice. Dr. Taylor\nstates that while he knows of no\npublished work refuting the con\nclusions of the Rcmsen Hoard on the\nsu ijects Investigated by It. of course\nnew reasons may develop for ex\ncluding a substance Just as new rea\nsons may develop for dropping an ex\nclusion. , i\nCertainly srlence must go ahead,\nhe declares; it is going ahead all the\n: time.
