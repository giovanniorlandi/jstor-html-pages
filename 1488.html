TROY, Editor and Manager., Published by the EMPIRE PRINTING COMPANY, Entered as second-* lass matter November 7, 1912 at the poatofflce at Ju, aeeu. Alaska, under tho Act of March 3. 1879., ,, SUBSCRIPTION RATES:, (tee year, by mall $10.00, ?ix months, by mall 6.00, Per month, delivered 1.00, NO SYMPATHY FOR HUERTA., WHILE people everywhere will, approve the promise of the, United States to protect the, life of Huerta. if he gives himself in, the keeping of the country, there will, be little sympathy wasted over him, by informed people. The ruin that, stares him in the face is deserved. He, brought it all on himself. It is the re, sult of sordid, calculated treason?trea-1, son to country, treason to friends, trea, son to benefactors?and cold-blooded, murder., Huerta was the commander of thej, Mexican army under President Ma, dero, and as such had successfully sup, pressed the Felix Diaz insurrection at, Vera Cruz, and condemned Diaz to, death. Madero pardoned Diaz. This,, was followed by a conspiracy between, Huerta and Diaz for the removal of [, "Madero from office. Of this conspir, acy the American and British repre, sentatives in Mexico ? Henry Lane, Wilson and Sir Lionel Carden?had, guilty knowledge. Madero was re, moved from the Presidency by the, army, acting under Huerta\'s orders,, and assassinated, also by Huerta\'s or, ders. Thus was consummated one of, the blackest treasonable conspiracies, that ever was hatched on the conti, nent, The foreshadowed end of Huerta and, his government is the logical termin, ation of the crime he committed?a, crime than which nothing worse Is, chargeable against an army officer., It will cause no surplse to learn that, the first American to lose his life at, Vera Cruz was of the Irish race. The I, lives of Irishmen are always ready for, sacrifice for the Stars and Stripes. The, Initial Vera Cruz victim was Daniel, Haggerty. a native of Cambridge., Mass.. bom of Irish parents., f IT WAS UNNECESSARY., ONE of the things In councction, with the terrible unfortunate, war in Colorado that make the, heart grow sick is that it was all un, necessary. Public sentiment in the, j United States is sufficiently developed, I to sustain people who are in the right,, when their case is put up to them, squarely, without resort to arms, and, money is a lot better spent when de, voted to education that when invested, in fire arms and ammunition., There is no place In the world where, people have bigger hearts or broader, sympathies than in the United States,, and there is no place where the sense, of Justice prevails in a greater de, gree, or where people respond more, readily to reason. Usually when injus, tice is done by public opinion it is, where the public is either misinformed, or not informed at all., The striking miners of Colorado had, a good case to put before the people., The mine owners had done many, things that public opinion condemns, ?chief of which was the employment, of armed guards?a thing that has, been made unlawful in many States,, and that should be made so in all., The Camp Fire Girls and auxiliary, organizations are providing useful, and healthful experiences for the, young folks of Juneau, and they are, deserving of the patronage of the peo, ple of the city. There should be a, good attendance at their first public, appearance this evening., Those reformers who are endeavor, ing to place everything under National, control are making a fundamental mis, take. Reforms in this country are, worked out more satisfactorily, move, faster and go further when the State, governments are used as the vehicles, of progress., OLDEST BANK IN ALASKA, The B. M.
