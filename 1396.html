Sept. 6—Re\ngardless of federal action in the\nmatter of conscription every able\nbodied man in the state of Flor\nida between the ages of 18 and\n45 are members of the state\nmilitia and may be called for\nmilitary service in that organ\nization at the will of the Gover\nnor. it was pointed out here by\nWilliam J. Ray. local lawyer and\nmember of the State Legislature.\n“Here in Florida,\'* said, Ray.\n"we have been living under a\nconscription provision of the\nFlorida constitution far more\ndrastice than the Burke-Wads\nworth bill.”\nPointing to article 14 of the\nstate constitution, he showed that\nit reads:\n‘‘All able bodied male inhabi\nants of the state between the ages\nof 18 and 45 years that are citi\nzens of the United States, or\nhave declared their intention to\nbecome citizens thereof, shall con\nstitute the militia.”\nRay points out that it speci\nfically says "shall” and not\n"may”.\nAnother section of the article\nempowers the Governor to “call\nout the militia to preserve the\npublic peace, to execute the laws\nof the state, to surpress insurrec\ntion or to repel invasion.”\nTwo Nations In Life\nAnd Death Struggle\nLONDON* UNDERGOES SEVERE BOMBING;\nACTION STEPPED-UP ON MEDITER\nRANEAN FRONT\n, LONDON. Sept. 6.—Adolf Hil\ni\nler stepped up the pace of his air\nwar on England today to a point\nbelieved to be the fastest of the\nwar to date. More and more\nplanes poured oul of the skies\nfrom across the channel, drop\nping all types of bombs on an in\ncreasing number of English\ntowns and cities.\nOver London, the attack was\n: exceedingly bitter. Defending air\ncraft fought valiantly in an effort\nto stem the tide, but report? of\nmuch damage came into head\nquarters here, scattered over at\nleast 30 districts of the city. Rail\nroad stations were hit and large\nbuildings suffered from incendi\nary* and demolition bombs.\nAll indications point to the\nstart of the real "life and death\nstruggle in the air" between Eng\nland and the axis powers, ac\ncording to observers at various\npoints of the British Isles. One\nreported that a formation con\ntaining at least 200 Nazi planes\nstreamed over the Thames es\ntuary in a beeline for London,\ndefying anti-aircraft and Spitfire\nplane attacks.\nBritish headquarters this after\nnoon reported that a total of 55\nGerman planes had been brought\ndown in today\'s battles and in\ndicated that their gown losses\nwere heavy.\nR.A F. maneuvers over Ger\nmany and Italy took on added\nspeed as if in knowledge of the\nimportance of attack at this time.\nCentering on French coastal cit\nies. the British reported success\nful attacks on Calais and Bo\nlougne and again reported that\nsuccessful raids causing much de\nstruction had been made on Ital\nian centers, chiefly the aircraft\ncenter of Turin.\n(Florida News Service)\n■ The Legislature is given au\nthority to provide by law "for\norganizing and disciplining the\n; militia”.\nThe second amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution says:\n“A well regulated militia, be\ning necessary to the security of a\nfree state, the right of the peo\nple to keep and bear arms, shall\nnot be infringed."\nThe federal constitution also\ngives to Congress the power to\n"raise and support armies, but no\nappropriation of money to that\nuse shall be longer than for a\nperiod of two years.”\n• So technically every able\nbodied man in Florida between\nthe ages specified is automatic\nally made a member of the\nmilitia or National Guard and is\nsubject to immediate call should\nthe law be invoked or emergency\narise. \'\nSWISS PLANT POPPIES.\nEXPECT OIL HARVEST\nilly \\%Kirintrtl Preawl\nBERN. Sept. 6.—Swiss farmers\nin the Brove valley have planted\nmost of their fields with pop\npies.\nReason: Poppies long have\nbeen a source of oil. which is\ngetting scarce in axis-encircled\nSwitzerland.\ndlj- Aiowialrl\nAction along the 1100-mile\nMediterranean front was stepped\nup today, also. Rome reporting\nsevere battles at several points,\nwith Italian fleets of ships and\nplanes making strong bids for\ncontrol of Malta and Gibraltar.\nBritish version of the Medi\nterranean warfare, however, was\nto the effect that Italy had failed\nin all attacks and that their fleets.\nix>th m the air and on the sea.\nwere forming for strong counter\nattacks.\nPrevious Nazi high-command\nreports that the British naval\nstronghold of Portsmouth had\nbeen completely destroyed were\nfound to have been entirely un\ntrue today, when correspondents\nreported very little damage in\nflicted by the Nazi bombers and\nthe British working at top speed\nto bolster the fleet.\nFAIL TO RECEIVE\nLICENSE BLANKS\nNEW FORMS ARE FOR THOSE\nWHO HAVE REGIS\nTERED\nI\nCounty judge Raymond R. Lord!\nstated this morning that the new\ndriver\'s license blanks had not\narrived at his office and that he\nwould not be able to issue new\nlicense cards until they do ar\nrive.\nThe licenses were to have gone\non sale yesterday but transmis\nsion of new forms to be used in\nthe case of those who will renew\ntheir driver’s licenses only has\nproven exceedingly slow. Tal\nlahassee stated they had been\nshipped last Saturday.\nJudge Lord stated he would\nnotify The Citizen when the\nblanks arrive.

Maybe it wouldn\'t\nbe a bad idea.\nIn Congress recently Senator Pepper,\nan outspoken and uncomprising New\nDealer, defended his plan to give the Presi\ndent war-time powers for conscripting in\ndustry and labor. Naturally this led to a\n.spirited discussion of the question whether\nthe conscription was only the first move to\nmake President Roosevelt a dictator. As\njet thi disposition is in the hands of the\nelectorate which can maintain its powers\nthrough its decision next November. Let\nthis writer reiterate once again that eternal\nvigilance is the price of liberty.\nOne expression attributed to Ed\nFlynn, the new chairman of the Demo\ncratic National Committee, succeeding Jim\nI-a? ley. tells one just the kind of individual >\nhe is. When Flynn learrted that Farley\nwas eager to get out oi* politics and enter\nbusiness because he needed money to pay\nh’s debts, he was heard to say. in great\nsurprise: "Why, in his position he ought\nto be ab>e to make plenty of money!” Sure\nFarley could have made plenty of money\nin the position he has just vacated, were\nhe a crook. Now we will be eager to see\nhow well Flynn will be doing financially\nas the new chairman of the Democratic\nN.vJ f rial Committee.\nPresident Roosevelt is panning all\nthose so-called apostates who are leaving\nthe Democratic party on account of the\nthird term menace and joining up with\nWillkie, but he is getting tit for tat from\nali those he attacks. Recently he said that\nSenator Johnson of Cali\'ornia is not a\nliberal anymore. The Senator replied\ncaustically: “My real acquaintance with\nMr. Roosevelt began when I fought for\nhim in 1932. Had I followed him in his\nattempted packing of the Supreme Court\nand his veiled and un-American deed*\nleading us down th 1 road to war and dicta\ntorship I would ave been a perfect lib\neral and progressive, and what glory\nwould be mine!* This is just the same old\npurge; the same old sham expressions of\nregard and affection, the same old stil\netto.”\nSERIOUS IMPLICATIONS!\n*\n“I’d rather be a ‘live coward’ than a\n‘dead hero’ ”.\nCan any of our readers imagine that\nthere are in our midst young men lacking\nin national patriotism and a sense of one’s\nduty to one\'s country who would dare to\nexpress themselves in such a manner?\nAnd yet, we are told by the recruiting\nofficer for the local National Guard bat\ntery that exactly that expression was used\nby mere than one person in Key West when\napproached on the übject of joining that\nunit for patriotic duty.\nProof enough L; offered in that the\nbattery Is finding it hard to find enlist\nments to fill its ranks, that there is a lack\ning of patriotism in this city. But, if the\nyoung men here are choosing to think of\nthis World crisis in such extreme terms of\nrank traitorism to our country, it’s high\ntime an investigation of the problem be in\nstituted.\nAs pointed out before in the news\ncolumns of The Citizen, enlistment ir. the\nNational Guard now would preclude any\nchance of being drafted under terms of the\nconscription bill soon to be a law of the\nland. Not that the training would be any\nthe less strenuous, but it does seem much\nmore creditable for those who would be\neligible for the draft, to not wait for that\n“forced duty” and enlist now in the guard\nbattery.\nKey West young men should not fool\nthemselves into a belief that this war busi\nness is anything to be taken lightly, as it\nhas been alleged some of them are doing.\nThe future, true enough, is quite uncertain,\nbut there is nothing in it certainly that\nwould indicate any tendency towards\nslackening cf preparedness measures\nthroughout the nation.\nDislike for war is quite natural, but\nthe interests of our country and of\nour loved ones will not be at all\nwell served by a lakadaisical view on\nthe number one topic of national defense.\nThey concern all of us. and we are quite\nsure that, in the final analysis, Key West\ners will prove up with the rest of the nation\nIn a sincere desire to help the government\nin its proclaimed effort to preserve demo\ncracy.\nPatriotism should be the order of the\nday among all of us, young or old. The\ncrisis now holding demands at least that.\nFINDS GERMAN REPORT FALSE\nThe right of belligerents to conceal\nlosses is readily acknowledged and to some\nextent a similar recognition is granted to\nexaggerated claims as to losses inflicted\nupon the enemy.\nWhether the policies involved are wise\nor foolish depends upon subsequent re\nsults. It often happens that the people of\na nation respond better to the truth and\nlonger retain faith in the statements of\ntheir governments.\nThe British government has a much\nbetter general reputation for truth in its\nwar reports than that enjoyed by Ger\nmary. Nonetheless, it is confusing to Am\nericans, who have seen press services and\nexperts give almost equal credence to the\ncontending war offices, to seek accurate\ninformation from the welter of claims and\ndenials.\nSome weeks ago the British reported\nextensive damage to the docks and ship\nping facilities of Hamburg. The report\nwas denied in Berlin ar.d German officials\ntook newspaper representatives upon an\nextended tour to demonstrate the falsity of\nthe British claims. It was notable, how\never, that the correspondents were kept in\na group and taken to special areas, with\nout being allowed to investigate “on their\nown.”\nNot many days ago Germany reported\nthat important coastal area in England had\nbeen virtually destroyed, that shipping was\nhalted and the usefulness of the port had\ndisappeared as a result of successive bomb\ning Attacks.\nMallory Browne, staff correspondent\nof the Christian Science Monitor, takes jap\nthis report and says that he has “just re\nturned from a trip” in an area which Ger\nmany has claimed to have bombed with\n“complete success,” and after a “thorough\nand unrestricted inspection of the vast\ndocks” he finds “that nothing could be\nfurther from the truth."\n“This visit,” he concludes, “proving\nbeyond question that in one instance at\nleast German claims bore almost no revela\ntion to the truth, throws revealing light on\nthe worth of their claims generally. It also\ntends to confirm that the British claims of\nslight damage done seems to be reliable.’\nTHE KEY WEST CITIZEN\nPENETRATOR PENS\nIn a recent column we told*\nabout our correspondence with\nMollie, a former Britbher, now\nin St. Petersburg, Florida. Our\ncopy of The Key West Citizen,\ncontaining that particular col\numn, was sent to her house. She\nread the item about herself with\n‘great interest but we did not\nunderstand it when she laid the\n■ newspaper down without a word\nand left the room.\nShe came back in a few mo\nments, a queer smile lighting her\nface. She carried a cardboard\nbox in her hands. Riffling\nthrough the box she extracted a\npacket of letters and handed\nthem to us. They were the very\nletters we had written to her\nas a youngster, while she was in\nEngland.\nThe first one was dated Janu\nary 7. 1914, in which we intro\nduced ourselves, enclosing a\n“ping-pong". The picture of\nherself that she sent back, she\ncalled a “stamp". In February,\n1915. we were at this stage. "Yes\nterday two ladies came and call\ned on me and brought me a bou\nqu t of flowers. I passionately\nlove flowers\'*. We also thought\n“Mary Pickford is just dandy”.\nOne thing in a letter of Octo\nber. 1915. mystified Mollie and\nour explanation gave her no\nfurther inkling. We went on\nhikes and twice we went on\nbacon bats. A bacon bat is a\nbasket-lunch with raw bacon\nwhich you fry on sticks over a\nfire*’. Bacon bat or basket\nlunch meant nothing intelligible\nin Liverpool.\nA reference to beach resort\namusements. which included\n“loonv houses” meant nothing to\nher. either. But we understood\neach other when it came to the\nmention of boys. “From what\nyou said about it being quiet be\ncause of your ‘boys’ being at the\nfront I should judge you liked\ntheir society rather well. If you\ndo. vou’re a girl after my own\nheart”. Boys and brothers came\nunder different categories. “I\nhave one brother, a small boy of\nfive, the tease of my life”.\nBy November, 1915. the mail\nhad become uncertain and our\nletter starts off, “Once again I\nreceived a letter from you, safe-\nIv”. This same letter reminds\nu? of the erihusiasm of American\nyouths to “pet into it” over there.\n■ “I pot a postal from a fellow in\nLondon on which he said. *Not\nenough \'■•xritc merit in America,\nso egrpe over h-^re—and found\nnler.ty”’ The letter continues,\n“He already has five cousins at\nthe front. From what you write\nI should certainly say that if he\ngot into anything like what you\ndescribe he got a little more than\nhe was looking for”. (This Ameri\ncan young man joined the R A F.\na-d was killed in action.)\nWe see now our proclivity for\nquoting others, in this paragraph.\n"On November 25th we have a\nholiday called Thanksgiving\nDav\\ which I am looking forward\nto with pleasure. I haven\'t any\nplans definitely but . That\nmakes me think of something a\ngrammar school teacher once\nsaid to me. ‘You mav have brains\nbut—can you prove it?’ ”\nIn September. 1917. after we\nhad entered the war. the tone of\nthe letters changed.\nthe U.S.A. entered the\nwar women have been \'knit\ncrazy*. I didn\'t know, how to\nknit but I learned and knit four\nwash-rags for practise. Now I\nam knitting wristers. In this\ncountry they are drafting all\nmen between 21 and 31. barring\nnhysicallv unfit and those with\ndependents. A wife doesn\'t seem\nto be sufficient to a man\nas lots of married men are being\ntaken. They have built large\ncamps for the men to train at.\nWe do not have to make shirts\nfor our soldiers as the govern\nment supplies them all clothing\nWe have not felt the ‘war pinch’\nhere vet. except on foodstuffs.\nclothing and coal. etc., but all\nMOVIE STARS CAN’T\nLOOK SKINNY\nNo woman can afford to.

Vinol has helped thou\nsands.\nORIENTAL PHARMACY\n•theatres, dances, etc., go on as\never”.\n“You spoke of Flag Days, they\nare similar to our Tag Days. We\nonly have one Flag Day. a nation\nal llag dav June 14th. Our Tag\nDays are generally small tags\nprinted to tell you what you are\ngiving your money to, such as\nVisiting Nurses, Red Cross, etc.,\nand if you don’t wear your tag\nyou get tagged again, at your ex\npense. They won’t take no for\nan answ\'er”.\nEven as now, when our am\nbitions for women to take active\npait in defense work is strong,\nwe, at that time, evidently be\nlieved women should do some\nthing besides knit. “Our girls\nare not doing men’s work yet\nbut when more of the men go\naway I know there will be lots of\ngirls tak : ng their places”.\nAs we hold those letters in\nour hands we think. “If they\ncould only talk”. They have\ncrossed the ocean twice, once\nduring wartime in which they\nescape and German submarines.\n\'They were taken from London\nto Liverpool after freque-nt air\n. bombings in the neighborhood.\nThey have survived two Flor\nida hurricanes.

Julia and\nGerald go back for another\njtrim While they are in the wa\nter they xee someone on the\nbarge Later Ivan is found there,\ndead.\nChapter 17\nEarly Wedding\nIT ii easy to look back now and\n* see that Sandra and Ivan be\ntween them practically signed his\ndeath warrant that night. It is less\neasy to see why Sandra was not\nwarned by Ivan\'s death. Which\nbrings up Sandra and her stu\npidity. that was not so much stu\npidity as a mixture of credulity\nand conceit I believe her suc\ncesses had convinced her that she\nwas infallible. On top of that she\nwas without discrimination, as her\nweakness for Ivan shows; and\nshe believed in miracles.\nThis last is the most important\nsingle fact to remember—the es\nsential clue not only to her char\nacter but to the terrifying events\nwhich followed the death of Ivan.\nSandra’s belief in miracles.\nShe came to my rooms the next\nmorning before I was awake. Ju\nlia had not stayed with me after\nall. Ivan had not needed her\nroom. . . .\nI put on a housecoat and opened\nthe door to Sandra, trying not to\nshow my surprise; trying, too, to\nkeep my head from floating loose\nfrom my shoulders; it seemed in\nsecurely moored.\nA surreptitious glance at my\nwatch told me it was not as early\nas i thought. I had overslept\nbreakfast. I searched for and\nfound cigarettes, which she re\nfused, lit one myself that did not\ntaste too good, and tried to get\nher to sit down. But she would\nonly stand leaning back against\nthe door, looking at me and twist\ning her hands in a gesture bor\nrowed from the stage but expres\nsive for once, I thought, of genu\nine emotion.\nHer eyes, swollen with weep\ning, recalled to me that incredible\nmoment on the barge when I had\nseen her clinging to Ivan. Could\nshe have loved that mountebank?\nApparently she had. Then why,\nin the name of all the saints, had\nshe promised to marry Jeff?\nPerhaps if I had been more fully\nawake, or if my head had not felt\nso light and explosive, I might\nhave pressed her for some of the\nanswers; might have caught her i\noff guard, staggered by this ca\nlamity which must, for a time at\nleast, have shaken her belief in i\nher patron saint or her rabbit’s |\nfoot or whatever she did believe ;\nin. Perhaps I missed my chance j\nto avert more tragedy. But I do I\nnot seriously think so. She would\nnever have confided in me. She |\nwas too stupid to be frightened 1\nof what she was planning to do; I\nand she must have thought, after\'\nIvan’s death, that fate owed her a\nbreak.\nShe said, suddenly. "I had to\nget out of that house. They—thev j\nmade fun of him. They’re glad.\nThey thought he wasn’t good\nenough ”\nHer voice was getting shrill.\nShe choked, said more quietly, “I\nwant to talk to Jeff without iheir\nknowing. She\'s in love with him.\nyou know. But it’s me he wants\nto marry.” *\nThere was enough satisfied mal\nice in that to alienate the sympa- |\nthy I was beginning to feel for\nher.\nI\nShock Of Dismay\n"DUT if you’re not in love with\njoff yourself,” I began rather\nbrusquely. She opened he. small\ndark eyes and stared at me as if I\nwere mad.\n“Not in love with Jeff?” she re\npeated incredulously. "Why, how\ncan you say such a thing? It’s just\nbecause I’m so fond of him— that\'s\nwhy I’ve decided—why I slipped\naway this morning. Look—do you\nmind if I talk to him here? You\ncan send an orderly for him.”\n“But he’ll be at duty—oh. this\nis Sunday, isn’t it? My head\'s not\non tight.”\nI looked her over, saw that she\nwas once more miraculously com\nposed, and suggested that she find\nthe orderly herself.\n“I’ll dress and get out as soon\nas possible,” I nromised her. “I\'m\ngoing to the P.Ex. for breakfast.”\n“Don’t leave on my account.\nThere\'s nothing private about\nwhat I have to say to Jeff—l just\ndon’t want to be interfered with.\nI want to handle my own affairs.”\nI assured her that it was my\nstomach and not her interview\nthat was sending me forth, and\nretired into my bedroom to dress.\nI heard her waylay an orderly in\nthe hall, and before I was quite\ndressed I heard Jeff’s voice in the\nnext room.\nHaving no wish to eavesdrop, I\nwas nevertheless an unwilling\naudience to Sandra’s demand that\nthey be married at once.\nI felt a shock of dismay. Un\nlike Sandra. I do not believe in\nmiracles, but I do like happy end\nings. Julia was so desperately in\nlove with Jeff that I would not\nadmit fate could let her lose him.\nThe scene on the barge last night\nhad fed my secret hope that some\nthing would happen. If only Julia\nhad been less gentlemanly; if only\nJeff had seen what we saw\nHis voice was a brief, indistinct\nnimble—dissenting. I thought, for\nhers strengthening in passionate\nentreaty.\n“But yon can apply for earlier\n’cave—and what does it matter.\nBIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT\nCity Clerk Roberts Is Daddy Now\nArchie Roberts, city clerk, and\nMrs. Roberts, 1016 Georgia street.\nannounce the birth of an eight-,\nanyway? 1 can move over here—\nwe can be together ”\nHer voice dropped to a caress\n! ing murmur. I decided that I had\nheard enough.\nI cleared my throat loudly at\nthe connecting door, opened it\nand marched past them as casual\nly as possible. They were seated\nclose together on the studio couch,\nand they paid no attention to me\nwhatever, so that I was able to\ngratify my curiosity about Jeff.\nI can\'t say he seemed actually\nthawed, but my brief glance found\nevidences of a slight softening\naround the edges of his icy re\nserve. His face was perceptibly\nflushed and he was staring at San\ndra like a hynotized but fright\nened bird.\nI went out into the corridor and\nclosed the door after me, con\nscious of resentment and a vague,\nunpleasant feeling that I had been\nforced into betraying Julia.\nGerald Beaufort was alone at a\ntable in the Post Exchange res\ntaurant. I joined him with real\npleasure.\n“You’ve no idea what a relief\nit is,” I confided to him, after the\nwaiter had brought my order,” to\nbe with someone else who is an\noutsider. Not in the army.”\nHe raised his glass of tomato\njuice in mocking salute and\ndrained it. looking at me across\nthe rim with gray eyes that were\nlike himself as I was beginning to\nknow him. At first you saw only\nthe outrageous lashes and musi\ncal-comedy manner. But under the\nlashes the eyes were friendly and\nintelligent; and under the man\nner, so was Gerald.\nJealous Rage?\n“you mean they take them\n’ selves a bit seriously,” he\nobserved shrewdly, setting down\nthe empty glass.\nI nodded, feeling guilty, as if\nwe were guests discussing an ab\nsent hostess, which was not a good\nanalogy, for we were both paying\nfor our board and lodging. Nev\nertheless, I felt disloyal.\n“I couldn’t help noticing,” he\nwent on soberly, “that it wasn’t so\nmuch the fact of that poor devil\nbeing killed that occasioned the\nindignation last night, as the fact\nthat it happened on the reserva\ntion.”\n“You can’t blame them for that.\nMurder ugly headlines.”\nAnd, changing the subject not al\ntogether happily, “I left Sandra\nand Jeff in my rooms planning an\nearly wedding.”\nHis eyes flew to my face and\nhis butter knife hesitated over\nthe toast.\n“Too bad.” He sounded as if he\nmeant it.\n“Why? - ’\n“Julia is a much nicer person.”\nI studied him for a moment\nwhile he went on prosaically con\nsuming bits of toast.\n“No disagreement about that,”\nI said at last carefully. “But she’s\nknown Jeff all her life. I don’t\nsuppose he seems very romantic\ntc her.”\n“Oh, doesn’t he?”\nThere was literally no expres\nsion to the words—an effect which\nI know from experienci is almost\nimpossible to achieve. It rang a\nlittle bell somewhere in my brain\n—like the one on my typewriter\nthat I pay no attention to. I didn’t\npay much attention to this, either,\nin the sense of getting scared and\nthinking, this man could be a\n.murderer; I was pretty sold on\nhim. But the thought did just cross\nmy mind that he might have\ndepths,\naepms.\n"That’s not the only reason it’s\ntoo bad,” he observed presently.\nAnd the gray eves were so open\nand candid that I forgot about the\ndepths.\n“What else?”\n“Murder investigation.” he re\nminded me. "Wife can’t testify\nagainst her husband. I’ve studied\na bit of law,” he added modestly,\nand then quite obviously said no\nmore.\n“But—but you surely don’t\nthink Je ” I began and. with\nsudden horror, remembered San\ndra in Ivan’s arms and Jeff com\ning up the ladder. Could he have\nseen? Could he ‘*ave killed Ivan\nin a jealous rage?\nGerald did not appear to notice\nmy discomposure.\n“I know less about it than the\nnewest recruit,” he assured me.\n“Here’s your check. If you girls\nwill vote you must take the bit\nter with the sweet and learn not\nto depend on masculine chivalry\nIf I had invited you to breakfast\nI should simply have to stand for\nyour eating up fifteen cents, but\nsince this is virtually a pickup. I\nmust insist that you pay your\nway.”\nThe cashier’s goggling stare pur\nsued us to the street.\n"But I still think it’s too bad.”\nGerald said with no change of\ntone. “Someone’s sure to think\nshe\'s protecting him.”\n“That’s nonsense.” I said sharp\nly. But I knew that it was not.\nJulia. I needed to see Julia. I\nstood on the sidewalk in front of\nthe Post Exchange and thought\nabout going there now. Then I re\nmembered Gerald\'s depths and his\nrather disconcerting way of leap\ning upon a conclusion. And meek\nly. but uneasily, I walked beside\ni him back to the club.\nSandra was still in my rooms,\nI but I was relieved to find that\n\' Jeff had taken himself off.\n“He\'s gone to see a man he\nknows about getting a special H\n; cense,” she told me. “We\'re going\nj to be married today if we can.”\nTo be continued\npound son born at a local hospital\non Sunday, September Ist.\nThe new-comer has been\nnamed Bryan Keith Roberts.

MARSHALL\nPresident. Key West\n1 Community Art Center Corp.\nShades of Michael Angelo!\nHere in Key West, where na\nture matures early and blossoms\nluxuriantly, are the budding mu\nral artists of the future.\nInspired by the many decora\ntions so lavishly furnished by\nUncle- Sam s artists during the\nFERA days in Key W’est. these\nyoungsters have painted from\ntheir own designs, as imaginative\nand colorful a picture of the spir\nit of Key West as only youth\ncan.\nDone under the auspices of the\nRoosevelt Summer Camp, which\nran fiom June 10 to August 30.\nthis mural is an outstanding\nachieVt ment and a plea lor some\nfoim ol art instruction in the\npublic schools.\nThe camp directors, Mrs. Eva\nWarner and George Mills White,\nin charge of recreational activi\nties, and F. Townsend Morgan, in\ncharge ot the art program, are\nto be congratulated on their ef\nforts and should be encouraged\nto continue the experiment an\nnually, giving the children some\nthing to look forward to in the\nlong summer vacation period.\nThe mural, an eight by ten\nfeet panel, was the idea of Roger\nL. Wilcox, staff artist of the Art\nCenter. He asked for volunteers\nfor the project and five of the\nclass students were willing to\ntry their hand at this adventure\nin paint. They are Ruth Striek\ner. Betty Lou Roberts. Nora Jor\ndan. Rose Marie Sawyer, and\nMarion Solano.\nHaving prepared their designs\nduring class periods they were\neventually ready to begin work\non the full-size panel, which was\na piece of wall board furnished\nby the students. Daily this com\nmon board took on added color\nand beauty. Here in one corner\nwas an island lashed with savage\nfury by a hurricane, palms bent\nby a titan wind, air filled with\nflying debris. Emerging from all\nthis is a beautiful new highway\ndotted with cars, symbolic of\nwhat was to come. Another stu\ndent tried her hand at sailboats,\ntropical colors and native plant\nlife. while her fellow artists\npainted away at their own inter\npretations of fishermen and their\nhauls, the naval base activties\nand glimpses of the Highway\nbefore and after the storm, the\nformer symbolized by a ghost\ntrain making its way to the Is\nland City.\nFinally, there it was—Key West\nthrough youthful eyes, glowing\nwith color; a remarkable homo\ngeneous piece of work consider\ning it was the blending of Five\nminds and techniques. Instructor\nWilcox added his professional\ntouch by lettering an inscription\nround the border and the mural\nwas ready for the critical gaze of\nthe public.\nThis noteworthy effort on the\npart of these young people has\nbeen suggested as a memorial to\nthe late Professor Duncan, who\nwas the well-loved principal of tht\nHarris School. He would have\nbeen immensely interested in the J\nproject and proud of his five clev- ‘\ner students.\nMAJOR LEAGUE^\nGAMES TODAY\nAMERICA* LEAGUE\nCleveland at Detroit\nSt. Louis at Chicago.\nNew York at Washington\nPhiladelphia at Boston, not\nscheduled.\nNATIONAL LEAGUE\nBrooklyn at Philadelphia, two\ngames.\nChicago at St. Louis\nPittsburgh-Cineinnati, Boston-\nNew York, not scheduled\nMoonrire 11:51 a. m.\nMoonset . 11:16 p. m\nTomorrow\'* Tide*\n(Naval Base)\nAM PM\nHigh 12:59 2:02\nLow 7:43 7 17\nFORECASt\n(Till 7:30 p. m..

These hunt\ning tanks, or “swamp bug\ngies" as they are called. |\nnavigate either the swamps\nor the thickets with little\ndifficulty, enabling the hun\nters to penetrate the areas\nwhere the bears have their\nstronghold.

The\ntrouble is that they get so busy\nthey forget. Not only that—they\nactually are humble enough I\nsometimes to think that the lit\ntle they can do won’t mean any\nthing. Sometimes they don’t\neven know how much their word\n; counts.\nWith job-seeking time here\nagain, it’s appropriate to think\nabout what you\'re doing to help\napplicants. In the first place,\nyou can write thank-yous to\nthose who helped you. It’s not\ntoo late. They’ll likely be only\ntoo glad to hear how you’re get\n, ting along.\nYou can nearly always give a\nperson an introduction or two in\nhis field. But make it merely an\nintroduction unless you can write\na sincere recommendation. In\nsincere letters too often sound |\nlike a device for getting rid of a\nI jobseeker.\nIf you are an executive you’ll\ngive applicants a lift in spirit by\ngiving them a hearing. You may\nnot have a job to offer, but the\nfact that you see an applicant\nmay make it easier for him to\napproach another executive.\nYour professional manner will\nteach him something he can learn\nnowhere else. Even your ability\nto dismiss him with a smile can\nhelp his morale. It’s a good in\nvestment of time. Who knows\nbut that the name added to your\nfiles may be the very one you’ll\npick some day to add to your\npayroll.\nAfter you help someone get a\njob. you should make it con\nvenient to inquire about his prog\nress.\nSAN CARLOS SCHOOL\nTO OPEN MONDAY\nINSTITUTE WILL HAVE SAME\nFORCE IN CHARGE; SPAN\nISH CLASSES RESUME\nAnnouncement was made to\nday by the San Carlos Institute\nboard of directors that the school\nwould reopen, nexfc v Monday\nmorning, coincident with public\nschool opening.\nThe same faculty will have\ncharge of classes as were present\nlast year. Miss Benildes Remond,\ngraduate of the University of\nHavana, is principal, and teach\ners are Mrs. Fina Esquinaldo and\nMiss Elba Esquinaldo.\nSpanish classes for all inter\nested. young and old, will re\nsume next week. also. Miss Re\nmond will conduct the classes,\nas before, from 3:00 to 3:45 o’clock\neach afternoon of the week ex\ncept Friday.\nInstitute directors stated their\nbelief that increasing interest in\nPan-Americanism would bring\nlarge attendance at these class\nes, especiallv during the tourist\nseason.\nDON’T BANK ON\n• •\nIt May Not Happen To You\nLUCK LIKE THIS\n< Aitftoriiifril rrfM Fratnrr Sfrvirrl\nCast your eves over the follow\ning paragraphs—but don’t count\non this kind of luck the next\ntime vou drive to work or go out\non the highway for a pleasure\nspin:\nDriverless, a car ran across a\nrailroad track before crashing in\n♦o a police booth at Glen Head.\nN.
