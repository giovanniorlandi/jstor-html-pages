Oct. 10. The state\ndepartment has announced that German\nembassy dispatches show that the Ger\nman general staff in January, 1916,\nplanned the destruction of the Cana\ndian Pacific railway and sabotage in\nAmerica. In September, 1916, Count\nvon Bernstorff planned to secure the\ncontrol of a congressional majority.\nThe first message signed "Zimmer\nmann," declared the general staff "de\nsires energetic action regarding the de\nstruction of the Canadian Pacific rail\nway" with the view of "complete inter-\nruption of traffic;" it stated Captain j\nBoehn was leaving for America with\ninstructions directed to Bernstorff and\ninforming him the military attache\nwould provide the "necessary funds;"\nthe second message, signed "represen\ntive of the general staff and "marked\nfor the military attache," said that Jos\neph McCarrity of Philidelphia, John\nCO\nHUY A IiOXI) AND DO YOUR DUTY!\nYou\'re not giving anything away.

In no other war have thev had a\ngreater opportunity for service than is\noffered in the movement for conserva\ntion of the nation\'s food supplies. Not\nonly does this food administration cor\ndially welcome the \'War Mothers\' into\nthe ranks of its volunteer workers, but\nan equal welcome will be extended to\nthe wives and sisters and all other\nloyal women who will enlist for a ser\nvice which President Wilson said is\nmore essential than any other which\nAmerican women can render. The Lib\nerty Loan must le subscribed and will\nbe subscribed, but it would be useless to\ngather this money or prosecute the war\nif we fail to make sure of the food\nwhich will win the war and the lack of\nwhich will, surely lose the war.\n"H.

It said the sab\notage would be carried out on every\nmunitions factory in the United States,\nbut railway bridges and embankments\nshould not be touched. It added that\n"under no circumstances must the em\nbassy be compromised," either in this\nor the "Irish-ProGerman propaganda."\nIn Septmber. 1916, Bernstorff cabled the\nforeign office that the embargo con-\nferetice, regarding "whose earlier and\nfruitful co-operation Dr. Hale can gie\ninformation," was "about to begin a\ncampaign to secure a congressional\nmajority favoring Germany" and re\nquests further support.

NEV.\nLargest Hotel in the State\nOwned and Operated by\nRENO SECURITIES CO\nUNUSED WEALTH\nThe problem of living, of providing the necessities of life, has\nbecome a most serious one with the great bulk of our people. The\nprices of foodstuffs and other commodities have been steadily soaring\nuntil, in many intsances, they seem almost fabulous. No relief is\npromised, but, on the contrary, we are told that future conditions\npromise to be far worse, and that actual famine threatens us.\nYet, in spite of these facts, our country has a stupendous wealth\nof resources still untouched resources so vast and inexhaustible that\ndid we fully comprehend them the mind would be staggered.\nWe are referring now to the vast areas untold millions of acres\nof land which have never been touched by the plow, now lying idle\nand useless, especially in the great west and southwest. True, a great\nportion of it is arid, or semi-arid, and would have to be reclaimed\nthrough irrigation, but with the magic touch of water, this naturally\nrich and fertile soil responds quickly and generously, and the desert\nmay literally be made to "blossom as the rose." The long dominant\nmesquite must give place to the apple and peach, and corn, wheat and\ncotton must supplant the omnipresent cactus. Here is the basis of\nsupply of the shortage of foodstuffs, not only of our own, but of\nother nations.\nWhy do not the inventive genius, the capitalist, the philanthro\npist, the social reformer, the legislator, get an open vision of the tre\nmendous possibilities these now-locked resources hold, and by every\nlegitimate effort, seek to bring the hundreds of thousands of unem\nployed in contact with this virgin soil, and where necessary, assist, at\nfirst, in supplying seed, implements, etc., together with practical in\nstruction? Too much "paternalism" in government policy is doubtless un\nwise, and tends to dull individual genius, initiative and effort; but\nwe have swung to the other extreme and left the helpless severely\nalone, allowing them to work out their own salvation or perish. Many\na good man and woman have gone to the wall who might have been\nsaved had the door of opportunity opened to them.\nWhy should not our government assist worthy families to get\non these lands, "paternalize" them for a while until they get on their\nfeet, and thus aid 111 reclaiming this vast source of national wealth?\nA.

Of this exemption\n$5,000 represents the 4 per cent interest on bonds of a face value of\n$125,000 (exempt from all normal taxes) and $200 represents the interest\nat 4 per cent on bonds of a face value of $5,000, exempted from all taxes.\nParagraph 2, Liberty Loan Act.\nThese facts mean that for the ordinary man the Liberty bonds\nof this issue make an ideal permanent investment.\nThat there is urgent need for this money in the nation\'s war\nchest is proved bv the fact that of the first 3,000,000.000 appropriat\ned for war loans to the Allied it is estimated that only $500,000,000\nremains.
