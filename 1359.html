        <pre>['T"*\nA\nVOLUME 9. NUMBER 33\nDECIDES TO TEST\nOUT SEPTIC TANK\nCouncil, After Advise From Consult\ning Engineer and City Attorney,\nVotes to Complete Work.\n"UP AGAINST IT," SAYS RUSSELL\nWarns City to Become Entangled in\nLaw Suit Probably Would Mean\nUseless Expense.\nSALOON ORDINANCE IS READ\nNext Week Will Be Up For Amend\nment, Final Passage Being Pos\nsible Following Monday.\nAfter having sunk $1,500 in a\nseptic tank which is to cost, when\ncompleted, in the neighborhood of\n$2,500, and which is hoped to pro\ntect the health of the city, although\nit admittedly is but an experiment,\nthe city council at its regular meet\ning last night, voted to finish the\nstructure, despite reports from the\ncity engineer that the cement work\nof the tank is defective and that by\nputting on the cover which weighs\n15 tons it may crumble the struc\nture.\nThis action was taken after City\nEngineer Carroll of Crookston had\nbeen called in to act as a member of\nthe board of arbitration, Mr. Carroll\nexpressing his belief that the tank\ncan be safely repaired. He estimat\ned the cost of a new retaining wall\nat $500 or that it can be patched up\nat a cost of $200.\nJohnson Presents Bill for $486.\nTom Johnson, who held .the con\ntract for building the tank, informed\nthe council that if it proposed to\ncondemn the tank he had a bill of\n$486.50 for work up to date. This\nbill was laid on the table.\n\'You are simply up against it,"\nadvised City Attorney P. J. Russell.\n"You can get into a law suit but the\nchances are against us for the same\nthing has been tried out before and\nI believe the city would have to pay\nin the end."\nAlderman Brown ended the long\ndrawn out controversy by making a\nmotion which carried, to the effect\nthat the septic tank should be com\npleted at once, the work to be done\nunder the supervision and direction\nof the city engineer.\nWork Will Start at Once.\nContractor Johnson will at once\nproceed to make the necessary re\npairs and to place the cover on the\ntank and he believes that so far as\nthe construction of the tank is con\ncerned it will prove successful. Its\nvalue to the city as a protection to\nhealth will only be determined by\nactual use. Mr. Johnson believes it\ncan be completed within two weeks.\nThe construction of the tank has\nbeen delayed different times, first be\ncause of a fear that patent rights\nwere being infringed upon and by\nthe time this was straightened out,\nthe weather had become so cold that\nwork bad to be suspended for the\nwinter.\nCity Engineer Condemns Tank.\nWhen City Engineer Everett came\nto inspect the work this spring, he\nfound that some of the cement walls\nwere in a porous and weakened con\ndition and reported to the council\nthat in his opinion the tank was\nworthless and should be condemned.\nLater, a board of arbitration was\nagreed upon, the city naming City\nEngineer Everett while Contractor\nJohnson chose M. L. Brown and these\ntwo ultimately decided upon Mr.\nCarroll for the final word.\nActing under authority of the\nvoters who last Wednesday author\nized a $20,000 bond issue to finance\nthe paving of eleven blocks, the\ncouncil, last night, passed a resolu\ntion issuing bonds to this amount to\nthe treasury of the state of Minne\nsota and authorizing the city attor\nney to arrange for the proposed loan.\nSaloon Ordinance Read.\nThe ordinance prohibiting saloons\nin all wards other than the fourth\nwas read for the first time. Two\nmore readings must be made of the\nordinance before it becomes effective.\nAt the second reading, next week, the\nonly opportunity to make amend\nments will present itself for at the\nlast reading none can be made.\nEight thousand acres of state land\nIn the vicinity of Warren brought\na price of $7.75 per acre last week,\nDRUMMERS HEREORGAMZE\nApplication Made By 27 for United\nCommercial Travelers Charter\nfor Bemidji.\nNOW UP TO FARGO CONVENTION\nIf a request to be presented the\nFargo convention of the United Com\nmercial Travelers on Friday of this\nweek is granted, Bemidji will have\na council of this order with a charter\nmembership of 27.\nHarry Mayer, at present a member\nof a Chicago council and who makes\nBemidji his headquarters, has led\nthe movement for an organization\nnere.\nThe following petition will be pre\nsented to the Fargo meeting and Un\nless there is objection, will be ac\ncepted and the work of completing\nthe Bemidji council will be taken up\nat once:\n"To the Officers and Members of\nthe Grand Council United Com\nmercial Travelers holding jurisdic\ntion in the States of Minnesota,\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Mani\ntoba, Saskatchewan, and British\nColumbia.

As a result, methods of\ngetting rid of the worm, as well as\nfhow to prevent them, are being ad\nvanced. W. G. Schroeder of this city\nsays if the farmers will but plow\ndeep in the fall it will be impossible\nffor the cut worms to exist. As a\nremedy for the worms already "on\nthe job," O. S. Keay of Park Rapids\noffers this recipe: One half pound\neach of white arsenic and Paris green\nmixed with fifty pounds of bran and\nsix pounds of sugar moistened with\nwater. This mixture should be\nplaced in small quantities at inter\nvals near the plant. It is said that\ntwo or three applications will clear\na field of the pests.\njfe\nMrarrce io ifc Cxpoaition\nBecause, in a spirit of fun, Miss\nInez Patterson, eighth grade teacher\nin the Bemidji schools, decided to be\nas frisky as the girls of her class\nwho were giving h&v a pjcnic at Dia\nmond Point, she nearly lost her life\nwhen she fell frpm floating logB into\ntine lake.\n?"Following iti^lc&ifc* lulicb in theJmeeting:was\nwoods,, the class which was enter\ntaining, in addition to MissPatterson,\nAnna McGillan and Minnie Lyons,\ntook off their shoes and stockings\nand all went to the lake shore where\nthey proceeded to have great fun in\nriding floating logs along the shore.\nMiss Patterson, a graduate last\nyear of the St. Cloud normal and a\nsplendid specimen of vigorous Min\nnesota young womanhood, being not\nfar from six feet in height, led the\njolly picnicers a merry chase over\nthe slippery, sinking logs and there\nwere many exclamations such as\n"Oh, the ship\'s going down! It\'s turn\ning over! Look out or we\'ll be in the\nswim with the fish!" and there were\nso many narrow escapes that the fear\nof falling into the water became less\npronounced.\nWith the bravery that comes to\npersons who become accustomed to\ndanger, Miss Patterson started out\nto set a new record as a daring\n"sailor of the seas." She jumped\nfrom log to log until she had .left\nthe remainder of the party behind\nand was several rods from shore and\nclose to the end of a sand bar which\nbreaks abruptly into deep water\nwhen the log she was riding capsized\nand Miss Patterson was plunged into\nthe lake.\nA chorus of screams and whoops\nand hollers not unlike a largely at\ntended Kickapoo Indian war dance\nfollowed and when the half hysteri\ncal young women and girls finally re\ngained their senses, a grand rush\nwas made to rescue Miss Patterson,\nbut, fortunately, the water was low\nwhile Miss Patterson is high and she\nsafely struggled to shore.\nThe conviction of a Chinese waiter\nin a Minneapolis chop suey house,\nfor selling liquor after hours was\nupheld by the state Supreme court*.

Hazen, whom Mr.\nPeterson wishes removed as sheriff\non the ground that he has been guilty\nof malfeasance and nonfeasance in\noffice.\nNot only, according to persons at\nthe capitol building, who know, has\ntlhere been a complete rupture be\ntween the governor and the attorney\ngeneral but the latter official had a\n"bad session" with one of his own\nassistants who dared to lake Issue\nwith Mr. Simpson in his contention\nthat action against Mr. Hazen can\nnot legally be taken, although, there\nare several affidavits on file showing\nthat the Beltrami sheriff swindled\nthe county by making false returns\non the serving ^)^^nai^s\nPetenon Charged With Perjury.\nAnother incident of the affair\nwhich promises to be a maker of\nstate politics, is the arrival of an\naffidavit from persons friendly to\nMr. Hazen charging Mr. Peterson\nwith perjury. This is taken as an\neffort to discredit the Peterson pe\ntition which asks that investigation\nbe ordered that Peterson may pre\nsent evidence which he claims would\nshow Hazen to be an improper offi\ncial.\nThe break between the governor\nand the attorney general and the at\ntorney general and his assistant\ncame after the governor had pre\nsented the Peterson petition asking\nfor an investigation of the Beltrami\nsheriff.\nAttorney General Obdurate.\nThe attorney general was ob\ndurate and has so far refused to even\nrender a written decision.\n"We do not ask anyone to condemn\na man without a fair hearing," was\nthe position assumed by the govern\nor, who insisted that the charges\npreferred by the Beltrami county\nchairman were so serious that an in\nvestigation should be made, and if\nSheriff Hazen should be guiltless\nthat he should be given an oppor\ntunity to* establish his innocense.\nOn the other hand, if the charges are\ntrue the governor felt that the sheriff\nshould be removed at once.\nThe Governor Decides to Act.\nBut the attorney general, for some\nsubtle reason, appears to be preju\ndiced in favor of Mr. Hazen or per\nhaps it would be nearer the truth\nto say that he is "agin" the govern\nor.\nIn any event the governor is not\na quitter in the case. It is\nknown that he proposes to see to it\nthat the Hazen charges are given\nproper consideration and that he will\nlend his influence to the removal of\nHazen, if he becomes convinced that\nHazen has done wrong.

It la one thing\nJto get in and play the game accord\ning to my own Ideas, and a different\nthing to set myself up as an au\nlorlty.\nA youngster who wants te play\nrat baseor anywhere else on the\nteammust have the natural ability,\n[e must be able to play the mechan-,\nloal part of baseball with ease.\ni A first baseman should be a left\ntaander. i This Is not eoncett because I am\n(left-handed, but It Is a clearly appar\nent fact that a left-handed man oan\nhandle first base more successfully\nthan a right-hander. He has the en\ntire infield "before" him, so to speak*\nand does not have to make the turns\nthat a right-handed player la often\ncompelled to make. Of course, there,\nhave been some brilliant first base*\nmen who were right-handed, but they\nwere brilliant in spite of this fact\nand not because of It\nA first baseman must always make\na specialty of handling thrown halls.\nHe must be able to accept the throws\nof other players without regard to the\nman who may be coming down first\nbase line from the plate at top speed.\nAt the same time he must take the\nthrow in suoh a way that he will be\nable to touch the bag and yet keep\nclear of the runner.\nThe youngster can learn the pe\nculiarities of players opposing him by\nclose observation. Nearly every bat\nter has some manner of betraying\nhimself. Few use the same style of\nbunting and hitting.\nI have found it good policy to play\ndeep" when there Is a pitcher work\ning who can be depended on to get to\nfirst ahead off a runner. Onoe I\nheard a manager say to a recruit who\nmade a spectacular one-handed stab:\n"Use both your handsI signed \'em\nboth." I should advise a first base\njman to use both his hands in taking\nthrows until he has becdme absolute\nly sure. A wide throw that gets away\nmay mean a lost game.\nIf you want to succeed at baseball\nlearn every detail of the game. It is\nja never-ceasing source of new prob\nlems, new situations, new conditions.\nJake Daubert.\nRThe prooeas of figuring out a play\ntlayer.\nhould become second nature to the\nCultivate the acquaintance of ez\nberlenced players and listen to them\n{carefully.\nObserve the rules of the game.\nNever bait-an umpire.\nBehave like a gentleman.\nPlay hard to win and never give up.\nKeep regular hours.\nLet "booze" strictly alone.\nDon\'t smoke to excess.

Coburn, sporting Editor\nof the Minneapolis Tribune has\nthis to say:\n"Next Thursday afternoon the\nMillers come home for another long\nstay on the home lot, and every\nmember of local fandom is hoping\nand almost believing, that the\nchamps will gain points on their\nrivals in the stand on their own\nstamping ground. Tough Luck and\nHollow-eyed Defea formed a\npartnership evidently to put the\nMillers on the toboggan for fair,\nbut the team with true champion\nship ability, refuses to be shunted\nout of the running, no matter how\nthick the accidents and ill luck\ncome.\n"First of all, it was the pitching\nstaff, and now, with a fairly com\npetent corps of hurlers, injuries and\naccidents have stepped in to help\nthe other teams beat the Millers.\nAt the present time Killifer is on\nthe bench with a leg that is so sore\nit is hard for him to take a step\nClymer has been in bad shape, due\nto the fast pitch he stopped with\nhis head at Louisville Owens got a\nspitball on the foot in a recent game\nand has been limping ever since\nSmith was spiked and is in only\nfair shape, while Faber, one of the\nnew pitchers, was left at home in\norder to get into better condition.\n"In response to a telegram from\nJoe Cantillon, Clymer left for Kan\nsas City last night and will get in\nto the game today. The cripple\nteam had Hub Dawson in center\nfield in yesterday\'s game, and Cly\nmer is badly needed. He says he\nhas recovered from the effects of\nthe blow on the skull."\nSeeing tho World.\nA new light on the servant question\nIn England is shed by Miss Loane In\nher book, "The Common Growth." "I\nasked." she says, "one capable, steady\nservant of five or six and twenty why\nshe changed places every year and by\nwhat curious chance her mistresses all\nlived so far from one another.

But this\nyear Lajole isn\'t attracting all the at\ntention.\nOne Joe Jackson, a recruit, is divid\ning it with him. Muoh has been writ,\nten about this young fellow. He came\nto the Naps at the tall end of the\nseason, touted as few ball players\nhave been. He proceeded to make\ngood immediately. In the few weeks\nthat he was a member of the Cleve-\nJoe Jackson.\nland team he made pitchers look sor\nry. Apparently it didn\'t make a\nparticle of difference whether they\nwere right-handed or left, he hit the\nball.\nAnd the pitcher has not yet been\nfound who could make him look like a\nbush leaguer. For Jackson has been\nhitting. He clouted .364 in the first\nfew days of this season, and so far\nhe has been one\' of the two men on\nthe Nap team who have played base\nball. Lajole, of course, was the other.\nJackson has been three years in\nbaseball and has played in four dif\nferent leagues. In each organization\nhe led all hands In batting. He start\nad with Greenville in the Carolina\nleague and topped the field with a\nbatting average of .346. With Savan\nnah he led with .358 and with New\nOrleans he was the pacemaker with\n.864. Last year, with Cleveland, in\n10 games he led the American league,\nbeating out Cobb and Lajole with\n.387 per cent.\n5porfii\n(jpasip.\nAs long as Mathewson and Ray\nmond are in shape the New York\nGiants are not going to slide down\nany In the National league race.\nIngerton is doing so much heavy ar\ntillery work with the Boston team that\nChance is beginning to think that it\nwas a mistake to let the youngster go.\nIn a recent game with Boston the\nYankees scored four runs on four hits,\nand made four errors and eleven as\nsists, winning the game 4 to 3, 4-11-\n44.\nCunningham, the young second\nsacker with the Senators, is doing\ngood work at the keystone bag and Mc\nAleer believes that his worries are\nover for some time to come about\nthat position.\nJack O\'Connor, former manager of\nthe Browns, has just returned to St.\nLouis from Arizona where he has\nbeen for bis health since last Febru\nary.

One would\nnaturally infer that a vairety of styles\nin hairdressing would be impossible\nto them, but this is not the case at\nall. By using switches, chignons,\ntransformations and the many other\ndevices of dealers in hair goods, all\nthe pretty conceits in the changing\nfashions in coiffure are copied and\nour gentlewomen continue to look to\nday demure, tomorrow vivacious an\nother day finds them with a stately\ncoiffure and then again they effect\nSimplicity. No doubt Cleopatra rung\nall the changes within her knowledge\nor invention in matters of dress to\naid her in earning the greatest trib\nute paid to her fascinations: "Age\ncannot wither, nor oustom stale, her\ninfinite variety."\nJust now we must concern our\nselves with suiting our coiffures to\nboth large and small hats. The new\nImports for midsummer are more than\nlarge, one may almost call them enor\nmous.\nThe large hats require a coiffure\ndesigned to fill in the space under\nthe brim next the face and head,\notherwise they look grotesque and\nURQUOISE is coming back. Just\nas surely as summer ap\nproaches, it is as certain that\nwe will have blue with us. It is the\ncoolest of cool colors and its dainti\nness appeals always to the summer\ngirl. A little, trying, maybe, at this\nparticular moment to hear of the\ngreat favor of turquoise, when we\nhave already spent our substance on\ncoral, coral and again coral. But\nnearly every one else has done the\nsame things and therein lies the\ntrouble. We are yearning for some\nthing different and it is difficult this\nSuit Coiffure "to Hat\nTurquoise Again in Favor\nWINNER OF GREAT OPERA PRIZE\nORATIO WILLIAM PARKER, who is professor of music at Yale, has,\ntogether with the librettist, Brian Hooker, been awarded the prize of\n$10,000 offered by the Metropolitan Opera company for the best opera of\nAmerican composition. The opera is entitled "Mona," and is in three acts,\nthe scene being laid in ancient Britain. The music of Professor Barker is\ndeclared by expert critics to be dignified and masterly. The orchestra-\ntion is also said to be most excellent. "Mona" will be produoed next\non at the Metropolitan opera house, New York.\ntheir beauty is wasted.. The small\nhats require only enough hair visible\nabout the face to frame it, but it is\nnecessary to have a coiffure under\nthe hat, for the hat must be taken\noff.\nThe puffed chignon shown in the\npicture is woven in a long strip like\nthat used for a "transformation." This\nstrip is drawn together at intervals\nleaving quite large spaces on the un\nder side of the coiffure, which are\ncovered by the puffs and curls on\nthe outside. These open spaces afford\nventilation, and they also make it\npossible to arrange the chignon in a\ngreat variety of styles. What with\nthem and the hair bands now uni\nversally worn, there is no end to the\nvariety of coiffures that fashion makes\npossible.\nThe chignon placed high on the\nhead so that it is in the crown of the\nhat solves the problem of the small\nturban and makes a stately and beau\ntiful coiffure. The puffs are crowded\ntogether a little and pinned down\nover a coil of the natural hair (or\ntwo coils) placed on top. Usually no\nother support is needed for this coif\nfure. In case the natural hair is\nvery thin a small pompadour may be\narranged by using a small hair roll\nbefore the chignon is pinned to\nplace.Julia Bottomley in the Illus\ntrated Milliner.\nspring, when the French combination,\npink and blue, is so popular, to see\na lot of pink without at the same time\nthinking of blue.\nSo hail the turquoise if you would\nbe in the fashion and wear it with\nyour pink rose frock.\nSilver and blue, gold and blue with\npearls and blue and white enameling\nare shown in the cut of novelties.\nSome of it is set like the Florentine\nwork.

If she is quite con\nvinced that her eyes are really\n"matchless? she contents herself with\nthe feeling of superiority arising there\nfrom and lets the jewels of her face\nsparkle unrivaled or wears the modest\nviolet, which would never presume to\nresemble the eyes above them.\nWhen natural blooms are not pro\ncurable the woman with an eye for\nflowers buys artificial ones of the\nrequired tint.\nParisian Ingenuity has gone one\nstep further in this art and provides\nfor itB leaders of fashion real flowers\ndyed with chemical dyes In any de\nsired color or shade.\nHardy flowers, such as camellas,\ncarnations and all varieties whose\nstems are good absorbers, are placed\nIn the liquid and allowed to stay there\nuntil exactly the right amount of color\nhas been absorbed.\nTo Keep Furs.\nEvery housewife knows what a\ngreat worry furs and woolen gar\nments are during the summer months,\nwhen moths are so ready to destroy\nany within their reach. Take a five\ngallon crock and after sunning and\nbrushing the furs place them in a\nthe crock, then cover with a heavy\npiece of wrapping paper which is\nglued fast to the crock, making it\nabsolutely air tight and there are no\ncracks or crevices for moths to enter.\ni This can be kept in a dry cellar all\nsummer, or if you have no cellar or\nclothes press get a large tin lid to\nfit the crock and make a cover of\ncretonne and use for a corner seat\nI in any room, and save all worry over\n1 moths for the summer.\nNovel Breakfast Cap.\nThe new nets, flowered in colors,\nare being turned into fetching break\nfast caps for the girl who loves the\npicturesque.

Over each of these\npoints was a single pink rose or a\nbunch of pink apple blossoms/\nPopular Trimming.\nLace is one of the most popular\ntrimmings on the new spring styles,\nbeing used on hats, frocks for any\ntime of the day and even the suit of\ncloth, and of all the laces Irish is per\nhaps the favorite.\nIrish lace coped from Venetian de\nsign i is a new factor in the fashions,\nand has been widely taken up for the\ncollar and cuff sets for either blouse\nor coat.\nTUB DRESSES FOR A DOLLAR\nDainty Frocks In All 8orts of Designs\nAre Now Well Within the\nReach of All.\nIt la astonishing how many dainty*\nfrocks for the summer can be made\nthese days setting the limit of ex\npenditures at $1, including the pat\nterns and threads.\nNever before have so many delicate\ndesigns been shown In inexpensive\nlawns and ginghams, and the busi\nness girl should begin now to make\nthe smart little dresses which she will\nwear to the office during the eoming\nsummer.\nTwo things should be remembered.\nOne Is that much trimming of any\nsort detracts both from the oool ef\nfect of the gown and makes it bad to\nlaunder the second Is that however\ndainty the very light materials are\nthey are far less serviceable than a\nplaid or a plain buff or blue dress.\nAs to the question of expense, be-\ngin\n^mm\nwith the pattern. Choose one of\nle new ones that are capable of being\ncarried out in several different fash\nions, with or without the high waist\nline or with long or short sleeves and\nwith or without yoke. Thus for 15\noents you will provide yourself with\na pattern for several frocks.\nNext, a few yards of white mull and\nsome inexpensive lace will make\nbroad collars and cuffs and a fichu or\na dainty pointed yoke, all of which\nwill serve as trimming, for your\ngowns.\nThen as to materials. Ginghams,\nplain ones, may be purchased as low\nas 8 and 10 cents a yard. A good\nquality of lawn In dark colors Is\nonly a cent or two more In price.\nCeat Hanger.\nWhen away from\' home one very sel\ndom thinks of taking a coat hanget\nalong, hut to prevent the coat from\nbecoming creased and untidy looking\nby being thrown over the back of a\nchair an emergency ooat hanger may\nbe readily made. Roll a newspaper\ntightly and tie it In the middle with\na stout cord, forming a loop to attach\nit to a hook or nail.
