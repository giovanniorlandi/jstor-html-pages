CourtHouse\nLobby\nExtracts From Speech of\nJudge Benton at the Bar\nAssociation\nAt tho recent session of the Kentucky\nState Bar Association Judge Bout on\nread a paper on tho Jury System Tin\nmost important portions of tho paper\nrelated to tho number of challenges\nallowed defendants in criminal cases\nand to what Judgo Benton termed the\nCourt House Lobby On these topics\nhe mado the following suggestions\nAfter securing a qualified panel\ntho next step is to select a proper\njury The present method of making\nperemptory challenges la civil cases is\na rational one but tho rule in felony\ncases reaches tho limit of absurdity\nstarting with thirty men and a court\ncan be run with twentyfour petit jurors\nabout as conveniently as with thirty\nwhen tho Commonwealth has used five\nchallenges and the defendant has con\nsumed fifteen only ten men or two\nless than a complete jury aro left\nThis takes no account of those who aro\nproperly challenged for cause This\nabsurd rule makes it reasonably certain\nthat a special veniro must bo ordered\nbeforo a jury can be secured in any\ns\nimportant felony case That causes\ncausesd\nd expensive delay but delay is not the\nonly nor tho most serious result\nTwentyfour or thirty men may fairly\nrepresent tho averago citizenship of\nthe county but when a defendant who\nis charged with and is guilty of crime\nis permitted without assigning any\ncause to peremptorily order fifteen of\nthe best of those men to stand aside\nthe standard and average of tho jury is\nmaterially and rapidly reduced It is\nno secret in tho profession that the\nhigh quality men the ones that are\nalways sought for the trial of high class\ncivil cases are tho ones that aro first\nexcused by tho defendant in a criminal\ncase This proposition of making a\na substantial reduction in tho number\nof challenges should need no elaborate\nargument to sustain it Certainly no\ngood reason can bo offered why the\nState and tho defendant should not bo\nplaced on exactly the sumo footing i\nand why the same rule should not be\napplied in criminal cases that works so I\nsatisfactorily in civil cases Lot\neighteen men constitute tho panel then I\nlet the State and the defcndent each be I\npermitted to strike three names from\ntho list and let tho remaining twelve\ncompose tho jury When eighteen men\nhave stood tho lest oj a rigid examina\ntion by opposing counsel and evinced\ntheir qualifications as free from any J\nfeeling bias or prejudice there is absolutely\nlutcly no reason why a defendant I\nshould bo given a further right than\na party to a civil case is allowed Let\nthis rule be adopted and there will bo\nfewer complaints about tho miscarriage\nof justice in criminal cases\nThe Legislature should bo given\ncredit for taking one step in tho right\ndirection on this question when in 1003\nit attempted to reduce the number of\nchallenges to ten but had its effort\nPhoo 912\nWP BAXTER\ndefeated by a veto from the Governor\nWhen a proper jury has been secur\ned the most important work in preserv\ning the jury system in its purity is to\nsee that no member of the jury is Im\nproperly influenced It may bo a\nrevelation to some members of the\nBar Association to be told that in many\nof tho cities and counties of the State\nthere are men because of some real\nor selfclaimcd power to influence tho\naction of juries whoso assistance in\nconnection with jury trials is more\neagerly sought by litigants than is tho\naid of tho lawyers who actually try\nthe cases Tho services of these men\nespecially in desperate criminal cases\ndemand a higher price than is usually\npaid the attorneys who represent tho\ndefendant in court This statement is\nnot intended as nor is it the ranting\nof a muckraker but it is a calm\nsober conviction the result of what has\nbeen regrettably observed in some of\nthe best counties in tho State\nThere is no name that so fitly applies\nt3 tho men who engage in this nefarious\nbusiness as that of Court House Lobby\nists and no greater duty rests upon tho\nbench and the bar of the State than to\npromptly put such lobbyists out of\nbusiness Tho countenancing of such\npractices by attorneys tho failure of\nthe judges to severely condemn them\nand utter the most vigorous protest\nagainst such practices will make the\neffort to administer justice a prodigious\nfarce disgrace the profession of law\nand bring courts and court proceedings\ninto shameful disrepute\nThe demand for the abolition of the\njury system the just and severe\ncriticism that finds expression when\nthere are so many mistrials in criminal\ncases when crime goes unpunished\nbecause of frequent verdicts based not\nupon what publicly and openly occurs\nduring the trial but which are secured\nby some hidden secret influence are\nchargeable not to the jury system but\nto tho abuses to which it is subjected\nand the chief of these abuses is that\ninflicted by the Court House Lobbyists\nThis ovil originating and springing\nup in the larger cities of tho country\nhas reached out until it now affects\nand contaminates the rural communi\nties and it must be abatcTPor tho jury\nsystem will be destroyed before any\nother method of trying disputed\nquestions of fact has been evolved that\nwill oven to a reasonable degree take\nits place\nAs a rule these Court Houso Lobbyists\nare men who aro in office or aro ex\nofllce holders and who in their opinion\nhave and arc claimed by their friends\nopinionI\nI and clequeurs to have political power\nand influence and who attempt to\nI assert such influence by controlling\nthe deliberations and actions of juries\nThis evil cad not bo overestimated\nTo it and to the unreasonable pro\nvision of our law which permits tho de\nfendant to challenge without cause\nfifteen of tho best men that confronted\nI him as jurors is duo more than to any\nother cause or combination of causes I\ntho too frequent miscarriages of justice\nin important criminal cases\nMr Hugh C Weir recently pave somo\nstartling statistics in Tho World To\nday Ho says that ten thousand\npersons aro murdered in this country\nevery earshot strangled stabbed or\nbeaten witha club or a sand bag\nOf tho murderers 2 in every 100 are\npunished Tho remaining OS escape\nabsolutely free There are four and\na half times as many murders for every\nmillion of our population today as\nthere were twenty years ago The\nsignificant fact about it all is that the\nrest of the world docs not share these\nstatistics Our increased wickedness\nis confined to our own borders In the\nmarch of civilization as applied to tho\nprotection of public life and public\nproperty wo have fallen woefully be\nhind Wo may lead the globe iomany\nthings We assuredly lead it in crime\nIn 05 per cent of tho homicides of\nGermany the guilty person is brought\nto justice In Spain tho number of\nconvictions is 85 per cent of the total\nnumber of crimes In France it is 01\nper cent In Italy 77 per cent In\nEngland 50 per cent Do those facts\nwhen offset against our convictions I\nin every 100 murdersexplain why I\nour lawlessness is increasing why wo I\nhave more homicides every year than\nItaly Austria France Belgium Eng\nland Ireland Scotland Spain Hungary\nHolland and Germany combined\nCan it be that it was a premonition\nof tho advent of the Court House Lob\nbyists that caused Kiplin to explain\nWe aro not ruled by murders but\nonlyby their friends\nA most effective means of ending\nthis revel of crime this wanton and\nbarbarous Ihedding of human blood and\ndestruction of human life will be\nfound in confining the defendant to\nthree peremptory challenges in select\ning a jury and in destroying the\nCourt House Lobby The doing of the\nfirst will cripple tho power of the\nsecond Tho machinations of tho lob\nbyists begin as soon as tho list of jurors\ndrawn for any particular term of court\nis made public and ho is most potent\nwhen he is called upon to aid in select\ning the fifteen men most desirable to\nget rid of and when that is done it\nI becomes his duty to manifest his inter\nest to and exert his influence upon\nhis personal friends and political ad\nherents ho has succeeded in getting\nselected for and retained on the jury\nThere are two methods that will effect\nually rid any community of Court\nHouse Lobbyists Ono is to create a\npublic sentiment that will not tolerate\nsuch practices The eyes of the sub\nstantial citizenship of the country must\nbe opened wide to this corrupting prac\ntice and when once the interest of\ni that citizenship is righteously aroused\nI no litigant will daro accept the ser\nvices of a lobbyists\nIvices members of the bar have it in\ntheir power to stop such practices\nContinued on Pago 4\nFlying Maeliines\nA few years ago flying\nmachines were hardly\nthought of nor was\nScotts
