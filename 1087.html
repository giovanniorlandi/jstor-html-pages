        <pre>['“The present attempt to limit and control Islam in Central Asia, and particularly to nip \nfundamentalism in the bud without simultaneous dramatic attempts to reverse the \neconomic and social decline of the countries o f the region, seem likely actually to hasten \nthe growth of more strictly observed Islam, as the secular authorities demonstrate their\nown spiritual and material poverty.”\nCentral Asia’s Islamic Awakening\nby M a rth a  B rill O l c o t t\nD\nuring the six years under Mikhail Gorbachev’s \nleadership, the Soviet Union, long a rival of the \nWest, became both a friend and a major \nmarketplace for Western goods. In December 1991, \nliterally overnight, this new Soviet Union ceased to \nexist, leaving in its place 15 independent states, each \nunstable in some basic way.\nSome of these new states were seen as potentially \nmore troublesome than others, but the five in Central \nAsia— Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmeni\xad\nstan, and Uzbekistan—were generally regarded as the \nmost threatening. Until December 1991 the five nomi\xad\nnally separate republics had been forced to obey a \nsingle set of directives emanating from Moscow. Sud\xad\ndenly all became autonomous and fully self-governing, \nadding five new countries to the caldron of rival \nideologies and competing political ambitions in the \nMiddle East and South Asia.\nWhat most worried the international community \nabout the Central Asian states was their Muslim \nheritage, and the fear that national xenophobia legiti\xad\nmated by the fall of communism could be reinforced by \nreligious extremism. Independence came to Central \nAsia at a time when some Western observers were \nwarning about a fundamental confrontation between \nthe Islamic world and the Christian world. Could the \nSoviet collapse add several new anti-Western, funda\xad\nmentalist societies to the Muslim camp? According to \nthis line of thinking, the mere fact that the majority or a \nplurality of the population in each of the Central Asian\nMartha Brill O lcott is a professor of political science at \nColgate University and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy \nResearch Institute in Philadelphia.\nfin Kazakhstan, Kazakhs made up approximately 41 per\xad\ncent of the population at independence, and still constitute a \nminority numerically; they are now, however, the largest \nsingle ethnic group. In the other former republics, the \n“Muslim” population ranges from approximately 65 percent \nin Kyrgyzstan to more than 80 percent in Turkmenistan.\ncountries was in some way “Muslim” made them \nsusceptible to foreign actors who wished the West ill \nand who, under the guise of Islamic brotherhood, \nwould use these politically inexperienced peoples to \nadvance their own global aims.1\nIronically, these fears are shared by the Central \nAsian leaders, most of whom are unwilling founding \nfathers originally installed by Moscow. Products of the \nSoviet system, they feel a far stronger cultural affinity \nfor the non-Muslim societies of Europe and Asia than \nfor the Muslim ones; even Turkey is a more “Muslim” \ncountry than many would be personally comfortable \nliving in. Furthermore, most of them have been \ntraumatized by the two-year-old civil war in Tajikistan, \nwhich they understand as an illustration of the internal \ndangers Islam can present for their societies. \nUzbekistan’s president, Islam Karimov, has given the \nneed to prevent religiously inspired instability as his \njustification for imposing a harsh one-man rule that \nspecifically limits the impingement of Islam on the \ncivic sphere. Even Kyrgyzstan’s Askar Akayev and \nKazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev, the region’s most \ndemocratically inclined presidents, have taken the \nlesson of Tajikistan to be that Islam must not be \nallowed to intrude on the functions of the state, and \nthat “stability” must be preserved even at the cost of \nthe growth of an independent political culture.\nAn increase in Islam’s public presence is also widely \nfeared by the “stranded” Russian populations of \nCentral Asia. The percentage of ethnic Russians living \nin these former republics varies from about 8 percent \nin Uzbekistan to some 37 percent in Kazakhstan, but \ntheir influence is more than simply numerical; these \nRussians are primarily the remains of an imported \nSoviet elite that still controls many important adminis\xad\ntrative, financial, and technical positions. Moreover, \nmany of these Russians are tied into patronage and \nsupport networks in Russia, so that the Russian \ncommunities in Central Asia have received consider\xad\nable attention, from the world and even more so in\n150\n', "Central Asia's Islamic Awakening • 151\nRussia itself, on issues related to their loss of privilege \nsince independence.\nBut the dangers of fundamentalist Islam in Central \nAsia have often been invoked in worst-case scenarios \nby those with little first-hand or even second-hand \nknowledge about the role Islam plays in the region’s \nsocieties. In fact, if “fundamentalism” is defined \nstrictly— to mean an organized movement led by those \nschooled in the founding teachings of their religion \nthat aims at compelling their co-religionists, forcibly \nunder certain cirsumstances, to live in a community \ngoverned by the rules of the faith— then there are few \n“fundamentalists” in Central Asia.\nAt the same time, Islam is an important component \nof the new nationalisms that most of the Central Asian \nstates are encouraging, while independence has brought \ntheir peoples into extensive, direct economic and \npolitical contact with near and distant Muslim neigh\xad\nbors. And even before independence, two types of \nIslamic revival were simultaneously commencing in \nCentral Asia: widespread revivification of the Muslim \npractices of the past, and— though many fewer partici\xad\npated in this— an exploration of true Islamic literalism.\nWho is Muslim in central asia?\nUntil the Bolshevik Revolution, Central Asia was \nvery much a part of the Muslim world; indeed, at \nvarious times in its history it had been a major center of \nIslamic culture. At the beginning of this century an \nestimated 15,000 to 20,000 students attended the \nmedresseh of Bukhara, the focal point of religious \neducation in Central Asia, while some 40,000 clerics in \nthe Bukharan Emirate served more than 7,000 mosques, \nshrines, and medresseh.\nFor Stalin, who was commissar of nationalities \nbefore becoming general secretary of the Communist \nparty, both religion and nationalism were enemy \nideologies, and both would be undercut by the division \nof Central Asia into smaller units, the placing of \nreligion under extremely tight state control, and savage \nrepression of clergy and the faithful. Socialist experi\xad\nments elsewhere in the Muslim world never achieved \nresults on the scale the Soviets managed in Central \nAsia: virtual destruction of an entire Islamic hierarchy.\nHowever, even the Soviets were unable to eliminate \nthe more unstructured and informal religion that \npeople practiced, especially in the countryside. Exist\xad\ning information on Islam in the Soviet Union is so \nflawed that it is difficult to gain any sense of the size of \nthe community of believers in Central Asia or of their \nprecise practices. Because of the small number of \nlegally authorized clerics, mosques, and religious \nschools there was little attention to doctrine and no \nuniformity of religious practice in Soviet Central Asia.\n2This thesis is argued at length in S. P. Poliakov, Everyday \nIslam (Armonk, N.Y.: M. E. Sharpe, 1992).\nThe region did not have Islamic courts, and restrictions \non clerics in state-sanctioned mosques were se\xad\nvere— no sermons, no missionary work to attract new \nbelievers, and no criticism of state policy.\nAs a result, Central Asian Islam became more \nsyncretic, and religious practices often became infused \nwith local pre-Islamic ritual. There was some justifica\xad\ntion for the Soviet claim that most Islamic traditions in \nCentral Asia were as much ethnic or national as they \nwere religious. However, this did not mean that \nCentral Asians were losing their identity as Muslims; \nindeed, kinship and residential groups helped keep \nboth the religious and the ethnic identity of the Central \nAsians intact, so that for most people the two became \nsynonymous. One Soviet sociologist sent to Central \nAsia to “count believers” in Tajikistan complained that \nthe task was impossible since the answer to his \nquestion, “Are you a Muslim?” was typically, “Of \ncourse, I’m a Tajik.”\nLong before independence most Central Asians \npracticed the age-old rituals of the Islamic community— \ncircumcision, Islamic marriage and burial. Few were \naware that these were illegal; even some professional \n“atheist” lecturers in Muslim republics were unaware \nthat performance of a circumcision, save in instances of \nmedical need, violated Soviet law. In the countryside in \nparticular—where the overwhelming majority of Cen\xad\ntral Asians still live— the practice of Islam was not so \ndifferent from what it was elsewhere in the Muslim \nworld, especially in countries where Islam was not a \nstate religion.\nThere was often no mosque, but a communal \nmeeting house served the same purpose. There was no \nmedresseh, but there was almost always an elder able \nto teach small groups of young boys how to read the \nKoran and sometimes there was a woman who could \ninstruct interested girls as well. The believers’ need for \nsecrecy, and Soviet researchers’ lack of desire to \ndiscover truths unpleasant to the party, makes quantifi\xad\ncation impossible, but what partial data does exist \nmakes it a safe assumption that at least from the \nmid-1970s on there was some form of mosque or \nprayer house complete with a mechet, or study group, \nin every Central Asian community.2\nA USEFUL RELIGION\nThis Muslim heritage of Central Asia presents the \ncurrent leaders of all five new states with a virtually \nirresolvable paradox. The dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion not only turned Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan into indepen\xad\ndent countries but transformed Islam from a minority \nfaith, a largely suppressed religion of the colonized, \ninto the majority faith of newly independent popula\xad\ntions.\nIslam offers enormous advantages to the presidents \nof the Central Asian nations, who must now secure\n", '152 • CURRENT HISTORY • April 1994\ntheir positions through popular election rather than by \nappointment from Moscow. In the 30 months since \nindependence all of Central Asia’s states have begun to \nunravel, to one degree or another. The disappoint\xad\nments of the “market system” have been many: \nproductivity has plummeted and shows little sign of \nrecovery; a tiny minority has prospered obscenely \nwhile the majority of people has been greatly impover\xad\nished; and daily life for most has gone from threadbare \nbut tolerable to intolerable.\nFor a population that knows it is historically Mus\xad\nlim, and that has little else to define itself by, Islam and \nthe values it espouses are attractive. This is particularly \ntrue in these ex-Soviet states, where the presidents, the \nelites, and the masses are all equally accustomed to \nhaving the state justify its practices and policies in \nterms of an overriding ideology. Strictly observed Islam \nis an inviting substitute for the deposed ideology of \ncommunism. Islam’s injunctions against usury and the \nobligation it imposes on the faithful to provide charity \nsoften many of the features of capitalism that seem \nmost obnoxious to former citizens of the Soviet Union, \nwhile the ban on alcohol and, to a lesser extent, \ngambling provide important checks against debilitating \nsocial practices. The obligations of education, obedi\xad\nence to elders, respect for property, and observation of \nthe duties of family and civic life all give substance to \nbehavior the Central Asian states would otherwise have \nlittle grounds for cultivating.\nInternationally too, Islam has dimensions that can \nsubstantially reduce the long odds against the survival \nof the Central Asian nations as independent states. \nThese states require proactive international recogni\xad\ntion— not just from Russia, which remains capable of \nending their independence at will—but also from a \ngroup of wealthier nations willing to supply the \ninvestment, assistance, and expertise needed for the \ntransition from dependent appendage of the Soviet \nUnion to independent nation.\nFrom the time they began to declare their state’s \nsovereignty, and continuing into the period after \nindependence, the leaders of the Central Asian coun\xad\ntries expected that the ethnic and religious heritages of \ntheir nations would be a trump card in the interna\xad\ntional community, allowing them to trade on their \n“Turkishness” or “Persianness,” as well as their \n“Muslimness,” in order to receive massive amounts of \ncredits, grants, and aid.\nThus all the region’s leaders have been actively \nencouraging the dissemination of Islam. Where Central \nAsians once had to hide their practice of the religion, it \nis now commonplace for state occasions to begin with \na mullah offering some form of blessing (although in \nKyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan a Russian Orthodox priest \noften gives a benediction as well). In Uzbekistan and \nTurkmenistan, clerics formally participate in the govern\xad\nment, if in a limited way. Islamic clerics rather than\nparty ideologists now head state departments of reli\xad\ngious affairs, where part of their task is to introduce \nlimited formal religious (Islamic) instruction in state \nschools. Although the constitutions or fundamental \nlaws of all five Central Asian countries specify that the \nnew states will be strictly secular, these same legal \ndocuments, except in Kazakhstan’s case, also credit \nIslam with having played a role in the nation’s history, \nand reserve a special if unspecified status for the \nreligion.\nEach of the new states has also sought to introduce \nan Islamic dimension into its foreign policy, in some \ncases even going so far as to court countries like Iran, or \neven Libya. Tajikistan’s President Kakhar Makhkamov \nwas rumored to have been negotiating with Libyans in \nsearch of uranium just before he was ousted in \nSeptember 1991 (the Libyans are said to have gone \nhome empty-handed). President Karimov of Uzbe\xad\nkistan spent much of 1992 and 1993 making thinly \nveiled attacks on Iranian activities in Tajikistan, but \nwhen the prospect of improved economic cooperation \nwith Iran arose, he warmly welcomed Iranian President \nAli Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to Tashkent. So did \nAkayev in Kyrgyzstan, who went Karimov one better, \nparticipating in public prayer sessions with Rafsanjani. \nTurkmenistan’s president, Sapurmurad Niyazov, makes \nno secret of his close ties with the neighboring \nIranians, who serve as Turkmenistan’s conduit to the \noutside world and who hope to develop into the \nrepublic’s second-largest trade partner after Russia. \nOnly Kazakhstan’s Nazarbayev, the leader of a nation \nin which nearly half the population is Christian, has \nbeen careful to keep relations with Iran and Saudi \nArabia from taking on a personal dimension, concen\xad\ntrating official rhetoric on the development of eco\xad\nnomic ties.\nThe other presidents are actively encouraging Saudi \nArabia; in an interview given just before his October \n1992 visit there, Kyrgyzstan’s Akayev said that if the \nprice was right he would gladly make a pilgrimage to \nMecca. Karimov and Niyazov have also made well- \npublicized trips to Saudi Arabia, which the latter \nimmortalized in an official monument to his hay, \nerected in the main square of Ashgabat.\nSaudi Arabia is openly funding official Muslim \ngroups throughout Central Asia, including those in \nKazakhstan, and is generally assumed to be indirectly \nfunding the vigorous missionary work by Islamic \nactivists from Bangladesh and the Gulf states in the \nFergana Valley, which traverses Kyrgyzstan and Uzbe\xad\nkistan. Saudis also run a scholarship program for the \nreligious education of Central Asians in Saudia Arabia, \nand are said to be the source of funding for scholar\xad\nships offered by fundamentalist groups in Turkey.\nAt the same time, the region’s rulers fear too great a \ntilt toward Islam in their respective states. Indeed, even \nif any wished to, none of the present leaders can wrap\n', "Central Asia's Islamic Awakening *1 5 3\nhimself in an Islamic mantle, since all are associated, to \none degree or another, with past enforcement of \nMoscow’s policies of atheism. Such a desire, though, is \nunlikely. Public appeals to Islam are terribly unsettling \nto the local European and Europeanized populations \nfrom which the current ruling elites are largely drawn. \nForeign investors and benefactors also watch the \nCentral Asian nations closely.\nNot surprisingly then, each of the five presidents has \nrepeatedly gone on record to express concern that \nfundamentalist Islam could challenge his government, \nincrease social unrest, and complicate the attempt to \nentice foreign investment. The necessity of defending \nagainst such instability has been given as the reason for \nthe imposition of totalitarian rule in Uzbekistan, and \nfor limitations on civil liberties in Kazakhstan and \nKyrgyzstan. The belief that an Islamic government was \nbeing introduced in Tajikistan was the justification for \nthe civil war that began in 1992 and continues today, \nwith the “anti-Islamic” forces essentially kept in office \nby Russian military power, substantially assisted by \ntroops from Uzbekistan and, to a much smaller extent, \nby border troops from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\nIslam vs. secularism\nEach of the Central Asian leaders has chosen to try \nto strengthen his authority and increase his popularity \nby espousing a secular model of leadership. \nKazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev sees himself as the \nleader of a new Asian economic “dragon,” while \nKyrgyzstan’s Askar Akayev presents himself as heading \nan Asiatic Switzerland. Turkmenistan’s president, Sapur- \nmurad Niyazov, has had himself proclaimed “Father” \nof the Turkmen people, and Tajikistan’s Imomali \nRahmonov is the liberator of his people— from the \ntyranny of Islamic democracy. Uzbekistan’s Islam \nKarimov paints himself as a just ruler forced by \ncircumstances to employ authoritarian measures.\nIt is unclear, though, whether any of Central Asia’s \nnew leaders really understand what the development of \na secular state requires, or indeed, if they have consid\xad\nered whether a secular society is a realistic goal for their \ncountries. None has ever lived in a truly secular society; \nalthough religion was banned in the Soviet Union, \nslavish devotion to ideology made the state that formed \nthem much more like a theocracy than a secular state. \nAlso, none of the region’s leaders can claim close \ncontact with or much knowledge of the Central Asian \n“common man.” Two of the leaders (Turkmenistan’s \nNiyazov and Uzbekistan’s Karimov) spent their child\xad\nhood in Soviet orphanages, but even those who grew \nup in traditional rural settings (like Kazakhstan’s \nNazarbayev and Kyrgyzstan’s Akayev) spent their adult \nyears rising through the ranks of hierarchies dominated \nby the highly Russified Communist party.\nIn fact, the political leadership of Central Asia has \ndone little to bring secular societies into being, instead\nmaking an effort to court the Islamic elite in hopes of \ncontrolling it. Those Central Asian leaders who believe \nthemselves capable of dominating the relationship \nremain on cordial terms with the local religious \nleaders. Those who do not— as is the case in Tajikistan \nand Uzbekistan— have turned on the religious elite, \ndefining all who refuse to accept the primacy of state \nauthority as fundamentalists. However, even they are \ncareful to define their task as weeding out the good \nMuslims from the bad ones.\nThe secular end of the spectrum\nKyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are the most ethnically \ndiverse of the Central Asian countries; nearly 45 \npercent of Kazakhstan’s population is of European \nextraction, as is about a quarter of Kyrgyzstan’s popula\xad\ntion. In addition, although the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz \nhave been Muslims for about 200 years, the Islam of \nthese nomadic peoples was based almost entirely on \nritual rather than dogma.\nLeaders of both states are relying on this relatively \nsuperficial penetration by Islam to permit them to \ndevelop fully secular states. Nazarbayev has no other \nchoice in Kazakhstan, for attempts to create anything \nother than a secular state would invite an ethnic rift \nthat would tear the state apart. Islamic parties are \nbanned there and in Kyrgyzstan, just as they are \nelsewhere in Central Asia; however, the definition of an \nIslamic party is drawn more tightly in Kazakhstan than \nin the rest of the region. The closest approximation is \nAlash, a Kazakh nationalist party that advocates the \ndevelopment of Central Asia as an explicitly Islamic \nregion but does not call for an Islamic state; still, the \nparty has not been legalized.\nHowever, Islam (as well as Christianity) can now be \npracticed freely in Kazakhstan. New mosques and \nreligious schools open weekly throughout the former \nSoviet republic, generally supported by funds that have \nbeen collected locally. Even urban Kazakhs are becom\xad\ning more observant. Religious funerals are now the \nnorm; Kazakhstan’s longtime Communist party boss, \nDinmukhamed Kunayev, was given one. But President \nNazarbayev continues to stress his own lack of reli\xad\ngious observance, and to warn about what he perceives \nas the dangers of a spread of Islamic fundamentalism—  \nwhich suggests that Islam in Kazakhstan is not likely to \nremain under bureaucratic state control forever.\nThe situation in Kyrgyzstan is more complicated, in \nlarge part because the country shares borders with \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan. There is a large Uzbek \npopulation living in Kyrgyzstan’s section of the Fergana \nValley that has always been well integrated into Uzbe\xad\nkistan. For the moment at least, this Uzbek population \nis quiet. The Islamic revival in southern Kyrgyzstan has \nbeen allowed to proceed along its self-generating \ncourse. Islamic parties and newspapers associated with \nIslamic political movements are forbidden, but every\xad\n", "154 • CURRENT HISTORY • April 1994\none understands that this is necessary in order to \nappease President Karimov of neighboring Uzbekistan, \nwho would not scruple to violate Kyrgyzstan’s borders \nto shut them down.\nThe more religious states\nIn Soviet times Turkmenistan was the most tradi\xad\ntional Islamic state in Central Asia, and Islam’s power \nhas only grown since independence. President Niyazov \nhas clearly stated that Turkmenistan is and will remain \na secular state, but he has also recognized all the major \nIslamic holidays as state holidays. Niyazov supports \ninstruction in Islam in state schools, and \nTurkmenistan’s official muftiate has endorsed an aggres\xad\nsive policy of mosque construction. Modem Turkmens \ndo not have the same strong tradition of religious \neducation as the neighboring Uzbeks, but this may be \nchanging; bookstores in Turkmenistan are now report\xad\ning a brisk trade in legally and illegally printed religious \ntracts, several dozen young people are studying at the \nlocal medressehs, and at least as many have been sent \nout of the country for religious education.\nThe relationship between Islam and state-building is \nmost complex in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Central \nAsia’s leaders all fear the spread of the sort of civil war \nthat has ripped Tajikistan apart, and most understand \nit to have been religiously inspired. However, it is \ndifficult to gauge the degree to which Islam “caused” \nthe war in Tajikistan. Unquestionably there was an \nIslamic presence among the opposition. Sources within \nthe government of President Imomali Rahmonov have \nclaimed that the Islamic Rennaissance party (ir p ) ,  \nwhich the regime has outlawed, had the support of \nabout 10 percent of the population. This is believable, \nsince Tajikistan, along with Turkmenistan, was one of \nthe areas of the Soviet Union least affected by the \nimposition of Soviet rule. Profoundly poor and over\xad\nwhelmingly rural, with access to the revivalist Islamic \ncenters of the Fergana Valley, Tajikistan was a place \nwhere Islamic practices remained deeply entrenched \nthroughout the Soviet period.\nHowever, on many important fronts Tajikistan failed \nto create the unifying political and cultural institutions \nnecessary for it to function as a single country, so it \nshould not be surprising that it fell apart. Islam was \nundoubtedly a factor in the civil war, but it was no \nmore than one of many. The truth of this is demon\xad\nstrated by the fact that the war in Tajikistan continues, \ndespite the expulsion from the country of most of the \nIRP and the official clerical structure.\nIslam has remained a tenacious force in neighboring \nUzbekistan, especially in the countryside. Uzbekistan \nis Central Asia’s most populous country, and it is \nnearly 90 percent Muslim. Immediately after indepen\xad\ndence President Karimov attempted to make Islam one \nof the underpinnings of his government’s legitimacy, \noffering not only such symbolic gestures as undertak\xad\ning a pilgrimage to Mecca and swearing his presidential \noath of office on a copy of the Koran, but also more \nsubstantial changes, such as giving the press the right \nto explore religious themes. The Uzbek-language press \nsoon was filled with lengthy explanations of Koranic \npassages, profiles of religious leaders, discussions of \nthe sermons and other writings of current religious \nleaders, and explanations of religious holidays and \naccompanying rituals. The man who was then the \ncountry’s chief official cleric, Mufti Yusuf, delivered a \ntelevised half-hour Friday sermon throughout much of \n1992. However, especially after the fall of Rahman \nNabiyev’s government in neighboring Tajikistan in May \n1992, Karimov has increasingly felt Islamic activism as \na real threat to his regime, and has taken serious if \ncautious steps to ensure that the religious hierarchies \nare subordinate to himself.\nISLAM'S FUTURE IN CENTRAL ASIA\nMost Central Asian religious leaders agree that the \nlow level of religious education in Central Asia makes it \nimpossible to think of the creation of Islamic govern\xad\nments in the region for at least two or three decades. \nSecular leaders such as Karimov and Rahmonov have \ndecided this means that Islam must be contained now, \nat its present level, so as to cut off political Islam before \nit can grow.\nWhat none of Central Asia’s leaders seem to under\xad\nstand is that Islam is not the agent of instability and the \ncompeting power they take it to be but that its spread is \ninstead a response to their own inability to control \ntheir economies, their societies, and their states. Un\xad\nless some unanticipated miracle succeeds in bringing \ncomparative prosperity to Central Asia, it seems likely \nIslam’s appeal will continue to grow, placing further \nstress on the present societies and their presidents.\nAs a consequence, in all the Central Asian nations \n(except perhaps Turkmenistan), the relationship be\xad\ntween Islam and the state remains as tense as it was in \nSoviet days. The current leaders and elites remain more \nconcerned with the negative task of restricting the \npotential spread of radical Islam than with the positive \none of creating the preconditions necessary for the \ndevelopment of a stable secular elite. The latter would \nmean accepting the succession of elites, which could \ndrive the current regimes from office. No leader in \nCentral Asia, no matter how seemingly democratic, is \nyet prepared to let power extend beyond the limits of \nthe old nomenklatura and their children.\nThe present attempt to limit and control Islam in \nCentral Asia, and particularly to nip fundamentalism in \nthe bud, without simultaneous dramatic attempts to \nreverse the economic and social decline of the coun\xad\ntries of the region, seems likely actually to hasten the \ngrowth of more strictly observed Islam, as the secular \nauthorities demonstrate their own spiritual and mate\xad\nrial poverty. ■\n"]</pre>
