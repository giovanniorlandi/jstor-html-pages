In the rear ca\nboose were Galbreath, Droslus and\nGreeley, who had been working on tho\ngravel train at Hartford City, and who\nwere en route to this city to spend\nthe day with their families. They\nwere all asleep as the train stopper\nnear Onward to make up steam. The\nflagman was sent out to watch for the\nthird section from the east, and no\ndanger was thought of until the train\nloomed up too close for any to escape\nexcept Weaver, who jumped and go.\noff uninjured.\nThe third section, with Engineer\nFrank Patterson at the throttle, had\nattained high speed, and when it\nstruck the \' rear caboose the engine\nreared in the air, turned clear around\nand came down on her side in the\nditch, mashing a number of cars Into\nkindling wood and burying in the de\nbris the sleeping trainmen and Hutchi\nson, the fireman for Patterson. The\nwreckage promptly caught fire and the\nflames kept at bay the uninjured train\nmen and the men who gathered from\nnearby farmhouses.

The house ot\nbishops of the Episcopal church on\nMonday took up the remaining amend\nments to the constitution. As soon as\nthis question is disposed of the bish\nops will take up the report of the com\nmittee on marriages and divorce. Tne\ncommittee has reported, by a vote of\n11 to 1, In favor of amending the can\non of the solemnization of matrimony\nby adding the following section: "No\nminister shall solemnize a marriage\nbetween any two persons unless nor\nuntil by Inquiry he shall have satisfied\nhimself that neither person has been\nor Is the husband or the wife of any\nother person living, unless the former\nmarriage was annulled by a decree of\nsome civil. court of competent jurisdic\ntion for cause existing before such for\nmer marriage."\nThe committee,\' In offering this\namendment, does not discuss the ques\ntion of the remarriage of dlvorcd\npersons nor refer to the belief heU by\nmany persons in the church that an\ninnocent party in a divorce obtained\nbecause of adultery is entitled to mar\nry again. The majority report, which\nis signed by Frank H. Miller, suggests\nthat the following provision be added\nto the proposed amendment: "Ta a\nshall not apply to any one producing a\ncertllled copy of a decree of divorce on\nthe ground of adultery, In which he o\nshe Is found to be the Innocent party\nby a court of competent Jurisdiction."\nThis report Is one of the prlnc\'pa\nbones of contention In the present gen\neral conference. The majority rero t\nof tho committee, signed by Dr. Mor\ngan Dlx as chairman, goes on to Eay\nthat, In Its judgment, no succes:fu\naction can be had in amending the\nconstitution of the United States so is\nto make uniform the law of marriage\nand divorce In the United States, and\nthat the only practicable way toward\nseeing such uniformity should be\nsought through the enactment of simi\nlar laws by the several states.\nCompany C .Was Warned.\nManilla, Oct. 7.\' Major Morris C.\nFoote of the Ninth United States in\nfantry, who returned here from thc\nIsland of Samar, was In Balanglga the\nday uefore the disaster to Company C\nHe says that Captain Connell had been\nfully warned and had taken what he\n(Major Foote) considered every neces\nEary precaution. Information that a\nplot was brewing among the Filipinos\ncame to Major Foote from a priest,\nwho said that It was in the plans of\nthe populace at both Balanglga an 1\nBasey to attack the garrisons, and tha\nthe Basey garrison was to be attacked\nfrom a cockpit In the rear of the La -racks.\nOrders were Immediately given\nto demolish tho cockpit and et&\nguards were stationed. There is in\ntense feeling throughout the army be\ncause of the massacre.\nAleutians Dying Off.\nWashington, Oct. 7. The rapid de\ncline of the native population of the\nAleutian chain of islands Is told in a\nreport just Issued by the marine hos\npital service from F. J. Thornbury, its\nassistant surgeon at Dutch Harbor\nAlaska. The report says that formerly\nthere \'were 120 villages on the islands\nwith a native population variously es\ntimated at from 1,500 to 2,500. Now\nIn the same district there are only 10\nvillages and 1,100 Inhabitants, exe\'u\nslve of whites, of whom 300 are Cre\noles (mixed breeds and with Russians\nand other nationalities), and 700\nAleutes. The remarkable mortality Is\nascribed to tho ravages of measles and\nkindred diseases, to the bad sanitary\nenvironments and to the lack of med\nical attention.\nAuthorities Clash.\nManilla, Oct. 7. Considerable inter\nest attaches to the case of Oakley\nBrooks, a military prisoner ordered to\nbe deported. The supreme court re\ncently issued a writ of habeas corpus\ndirecting the production of the pris\noner, but tho military authorities re\nfuted " to produce him on the ground\nthat the only tribunal having Jurisdic\ntion of a military prisoner Is the fed\neral court. While the Philippine\ncourts were established by the war\npowers of the president, the military\nauthorities contend that they are to\nbe regarded as provost courts until\ncongress has acted. The members ot\nthe supreme court and a majority ot\nthe members of the Philippine com\nmission ho!d opposite views.\nThe Tartar owe their alphabet to the\nChristian mlsslounr\'es known as the\nNestorlans.\nAMERICAN METHODS\nWill Make Kiiuii-.Ii Wntlroads Proflt\nable, Says Yti-kcs.\nLondon, Oct. ,. The opinion of\nCharles T. Yerkes regarding English\nrailways Is that they must be taken in\nLuna by Americans and worked In\ntheir way or else they will be laid\ndown under enormous capitalization\nand wasteful methods. A mass of\ntables Issued by the government this\nweek on railways In the United King\ndom in 1900 Is mighty unpleasant read\ning for the shareholders, showing in\nci eased working expenses, out of all\nproportion with the Increase In re\nceipts. Of the total paid up capital of\ni21.17U,000,000, 16 per cent, or 187,\n000,000 is due to nominal additions on\nconsolidation, conversion and division\nof stocks. The average rate of divi\ndend Is only 3.45 per cent as against\n2.i:7 pel cent in 1899. It is the realiza\ntion of these shortcomings which ras\ninduced the departure for Now York\nof several prominent officials of the\nNortheastern Railway company, In\ncluding George Glbb, the general man\nager, and Mr. Burtt, the traffic mana\nger, who sailed on the White Star line\neteumer Celtic Friday, the object of\ntheir trip being a month\'s study of\nthe American railway system.\nFather Kearney\'s Degree.\nZanesvllle, O., Oct. 7.

Kearney,\nprovincial of the Dominican order. Dr.\nA. V. HIggins of New Haven, Conn.,\nthe venerable prelate of the order,\nconferred the degree, assisted by\nBishop Moeller of Columbus, who cele\nbrated pontifical high mass. Cardinal\nMartlnelll, the papal delegate at Wash\nington, D. C, telegraphed his congrat\nulations. Fifty prominent clergymen\nwere present from different sections of\nthe country. Father Kearney is tho\nthird man In America to receive this\ndegree. The others were Dr. HIggins oi\nConnecticut and Dr. Kennedy of Som\nerset, O.\nPhilippines Not Profitable.\nDenver, Oct. 7. Congressman John\nF. Shafroth, who has been travel\'na\nIn China and the Philippines Tor the\npast four months, has arrived home.\nSpeaking of the conditions In the Phil\nippines he said: "Peace has been prac\ntically restored. There is still a little\ninsurrection in Samar, but aside from\nthat everything Is fairly quiet I do\nnot believe, however, that the reten\ntion of the islands will be profitable,\nas the government will have to expend\na great deal of money on them even in\ntimes of peace. It costs now between\n$60,000,000 and $75,000,000 a year to\nkeep the soldiers there, and even If the\nnumber is reduced to 30,000 the ex\npense will still be greater than the\nprofits from the islands will warrant"\nPostal Service In Alaska.\nWashington, Oct 7. Potolllce In\nspector John P. Clum has returned\nfrom a trip of Inspection through\nAlaska. He has reported to the dt\npartment that the service Is In excel\nlent condition, and particularly in the\nYukon valley, where the various towns\nhave a small service of once a week\nin each direction. He established the\nnorthernmost poptofflce in the world.\nTills is at Port Darrow, where Rev. Dr.\nRichmond Marsh, the missionary at\nthe little settlement, was appointed\npostmaster. This place, where the\nnorthernmost newspaper in the world\nis published once a year, will receLe\nthe malls once a year by a United\nStates revenue cutter.\nSwallowed Morphine.\nAtlanta, Ga., Oct 7. John Wyatt\nTurner of Rock Hill, Ala., assistant in\nstructor in the carding and spinning\nbranches of the textile department of\nthe Georgia School of Techno\'ogy,\ncommitted suicide by taking morphine.\nBefore taking the drug Turner tele.\nphoned one of his friends that he was\nabout to end his lire, but help arrived\ntoo late.\nSwept By a Gale.\nLondon, Oct. 7. A furious gale\nraged over Great Britain, the channel,\nthe North pea and Belgium. Several\nlatalltle? are reported as the result of\nfalling trees. Slight casualties at Beu\nare also reported. There was a water\nspout near Calais. Telegraphic and\ntelephonic communication was genov\nally Interrupted.\nWant Statehood.\nPhoenix, A. T Oct. 7.

Dr. Alejandro Lrbaneja, president\nof the executive committee of tho Ven\nezuelan nationalist revolutionary par\nty, gave out a statement regarding the\npolitical situation. Dr. Uibaneja Is\nthe virtual leader of the party and the\npersonal representative of "El Mocho,"\nGeneral Hernandez. He was a cabinet\nminister under former President Cres?\npo and is a prominent lawyer. He Is\nin ex\'ile in Curacoa.\n"The nationalists until the present\ntime," said Dr. Urbaneja, "have pas\nsively witnessed President Castro\'s at\ntitude and actions toward Colombia,\nbut they are now compelled to protest\nagainst them. Neither the national\nists nor the country at large have ever\nsustained the actions of Castro, ac\ntions which now promise an interna\ntional war. The nationalists do not\ndesire war with a sister republic, nor\nwould they follow Castro In such a\nwar. On the contrary they, as well as\nthe country at large, would refuse to\nparticipate. If Colombia had ever\nreally offended Venezuela there would\nbe no necessity for Castro\'s forcible re\ncruiting, as at present, in order to ob\ntain an army to punish the offending\ncountry. In such an event all Vene\nzuelans would loyally and enthusiast\nically Join to punish the offender.\n"I do not think President Castro will\ndeclare war against Colombia. In the\nfirst place, to do so legally he must\nobtain the consent of the Venezuelan\ncongress, which will not convene be\nfore February next. In the second\nplace, I do not believe the members of\nthe Venezuelan congress, although\nthey are all partisans of President\nCastro, would ever consent to a ruin\nous war with Colombia In order to\nhelp Colombian revolutionists. Neither\ndo I believe in the possibility of the\nreconstruction of Gran Colombia by\nforce of arms. Bolivar\'s achievement\nwas effected under certain special con\nditions that do not exist today. Per\nhaps a Gran Colombia Is possible\nthrough peaceful, Intellectual opera\ntions, but never by military force. All\nthe talk now indulged in on this sub\nject is a mere pretext, a blind to cov.r\nthe personal ambition of a few men."\nShaffer at Boy View.\nMilwaukee, Oct. 7. President Theo\ndore J. Shaffer of the Amalgamated\nAssociation of Iron, Steel and Tin\n, Workers made a flying trip to Milwau\nkee, iemainlng only long enough to\nmake a short speech to a few of the\nstrikers and then taking his departure.\nIt Is said not over 13 or 20 of the\netrlkers heard him. The substance of\nMr. Shaffer\'s remarks was that all\nmembers of the Amalgamated Associ\nation who are now at work in the Bay\nView mills who do not walk out at\norce will be considered as black sheep\nunless the mills are paying the Amal\ngamated scale In all departments. Mr.\nSliuffer\'s visit had no effect on the\nstrike. It Is said he did not see a- y\n, of the officials of the Bay V.ew m l.s.\nArmies Face to Face.\nCaracas, Venezuela, Oct. 7.

The New York Tribune, radically Re\npublican, in speaking of oratorical trib\nutes to President McKinley, says that\n"none surpass in dignity, discrimination\nand feeling that which was delivered by\nex-PresidentG rover Cleveland." As the\nGeorgetown News-Democrat remarks,"it\nwas a genuine tribute to the virtues of\nthe man, without a reference or allusion\nto politics in any wav."\nThe "argument" used by the Republi\ncan bosses in Maysville to force all the can\ndidates for city offices into a primary\nwas that the city was Republican by a\nlarge majority, hence the Republicans\nshould bold all the offices, and the way\nto obtain that desirable result was to\nnominate a ticket. Had those aspirants\nfor the honors of "bosses" waited until\nafter registration day, even that "argu\nment" would have taken wing, becauae\nTueeday showed the Republicans\n"haven\'t got no majority nohow. So\nthey haven\'t."\nThe Evening Post, of Louisville, is\nmaking a strenuous effort to explain\naway the big Democratic increase in the\nregistration throughout the State last\nTuesday. Richard Knott in an editorial\non October 4th says the slump in Repub\nlican registration iB due to the advent of\nDeboe, Barnett and Sapp into Republi\ncan politics. He puts it in this style:\n"The ascendency of Dnlion. Bnrnntt and\nSapp shocked the people of Kentucky. I\nTne chief surprise is that the effect of ,\nSappism, Deboeism and Barnettism has\nbeen so marked throughout the State."\nMr. Knott is quite correct in his estimate\nof his companions. At the most they\nare but cheap politicians, chained to\nmediocre. It is true the people of Ken\ntucky are not in sympathy with this trio\nof emergency Republican leaders. But\nhas .Mr. Knott sounded the depths and\nthe eli Kile of the situation when he at\ntributes to these menials the whole blame\nfor Republican dieafiction yea dissolu\ntion in Kentucky? If he will put his\near to the ground he will find that he\nhas grossly misjudged the cause, when\nhe atttibutes the great falling off in the\nregistered Republican vote in Ky. to a\npassing contempt for such unimportant\npersonages as Deboe, Bennett and Sapp.\nThe cause lies deep in the fact that the\nRepublican party in Kentucky has the\nblood of an innocent victim upon its\nhands, the stains f which will not wash\nout. The good citiz-ns of Ky. are die\ngusted with a party that could stoop to\nthe low depths of Republicanism in Ky ,\nand their indignant righteousuess cries\nout for the punishment of all those who\ncounselled or committed such an awful\nact of cowardice and criminality as that\nperpetrated upon Gov. Goebel. In the\ncontemplation of this subject, Mr. Knott,\nyou will find the reason for Republican\nlosees in the registered vote in old Ken\ntucky. CZOLGOSZ, TAYLOR ET. AL.\nI; is apparent from the conduct of\nGov. Durbin, of Indiana, that he does\nnot intend to honor the requisition pa\npers issued by Gov. Beckham, of Ken\ntucky, requesting the return of William\nTaylor and Charles Finley, fugitives from\njustice, for the crime of accessories to tho\nassassination of Gov. Goebel. This ac\ntion on the part of Gov. Durbin, is, at\nthe present time, and under tho present\nstate of public sentiment, to say tho least\nunfortunate. Even though ho Bhould\neventually conclude to deliver them up\nto the Kentucky guardians of .the peace,\nprocrastination will and has worked irrep\narable injury.

S. and putting b\'m\nthrough the severest \'\'sweat-box" that\nemtcimee and higher civilization will\nadmit of in order to ascertain whether or\nno he had any part in thai diabolical\nEchetne. And we believe these senti-1\nments are entertained by all true Amer\nican citizens. But we would have it un\nderstood that we believe in even handed\nj\'istice. And if it was proper (as it was)\nfor every one irrespective of party or sec\ntional feeling to assist the officials of Buf\nfalo in apprehending and speedily con\nvicting Czalgosz, we inaiet that Taylor\nand bis coterie of office holders (aside\nfrom any direct connection he may have\nhad with the crime itself) committed a\nmost atrocious and damnable crime\nagainst his State and society when he\nthrew around the cowardly assassins of\nGov. Goebel the strong military arm\nof the government thereby protecting\nthem from the civil officers, whom ho\neliould have been swift in assisting in\nthe capture of those violators of the law.\nWe have no objections to the federal au\nthorities arresting Maggio for predicting\nthe death of the President, we heartily\napprove of it ; but we want those blub\nbering sympathisers of Caleb Powers to\ndry their tears and come help send to bis\njust reward the man who not only pre\ndicted the death of Goebel, but ctanding\nat the head of a puissant army of moun\ntain moonshiners and murderers, pro\nnounced, upon the authority of a moun\ntain feudist, that Goebel would be a dead\nman in less than forty-eight hours. And\nhe was fatally wounded within that time.\nWe approve of the arrest of Herr Most\nfor publishing matter which was calcula\nted to instigate its readers to murder.\nBut, at the same time, it Bhould be re\nmembered that the editors of some yel\nlow sheets in Louisville did more than\nany other agency to bring about Goebel\'s\ndeath, through incendiary publication in\ntheir papers. When Czolgosz was being\ntried for the assassination of President\nMcKinley be Btood like a piece of statu\nary and he spoke not to any one; no one\nraised their voice in condemnation of the\nJudge who proceeded to try him whether\nhe talked or not. No one was going into\nhysterics because he was not "getting\njustice." Czolgosz\'s crime was a damn\nable ono. and h had no sympathizers in\nKentucky or elsewhere. We agree with\nour Republican friends that the trial was\nas much in accordance with the "forms\nof law" as that misguided fellow was en\ntitled to, possibly more so, but at the\nsame time our sense of right and fair\nplay impels us to call upon those Repub\nlicans who flew into a frantic rage and\ndogged and abused the Judge who pro\nceeded with the trial of Youtsey, not\nwithstanding his artistic turn at the\n"crazy act" to enlist the sympathies of\nthe jury and save his neck. We want\nthose papers and people who said at that\ntime that justice was being miscarried,\nand who were tireless in working up sym\npathy for that self-confessed assassin, to\nwithdraw all their words of abuse and\nvituperation, and unite with us in Faying\nthat the only mistake made in Youtsey\'s\ncase was that the penalty was not severe\nenough. He favor the punishment of every\njxrsun implicated in any plot to kill President\nMckinley. M e favor the punishment of every\n\' person implicated in any plot to kill Gov. Goe\n\'bel. Can the Republicans of Kentucky\nI say aa much ? If so let them telegraph\nDurbin to deliver Taylor and Finley into\nthe hands of law and justice.\nUnited States Senator Hoar, of Mas\nsachusetts, gives expression to these sen\nsible views anent the wild talk now going\nthe rounds advocating the restraint of\nfree speech :\n"I believe if every man of native birth\nwithin our borders were to die this day\nthe men of foreign birth, who have come\nhere to seek homes and liberty under the\nBhadow of the Republic would carry on\nthe Republic in God\'a appointed way.
