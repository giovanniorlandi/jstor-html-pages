        <pre>['“Brezhnev has . . . ascended the Everest of Soviet political power. . . . \nIronically, while the political Brezhnev is thus exalted, the flesh-and-blood \nBrezhnev is decadent; he takes on unlimited political powers and new respon\xad\nsibilities as his abilities wane. ”\nBrezhnev’s Year: Politics \nin the U.S.S.R.\nB y  R o b e r t  G . W e s s o n\nProfessor of Political Science, University of California, Santa Barbara\nI\nN recent years, the Soviet political scene has \ngenerally been monotonously placid, with hardly \nany signs of the kind of controversy that bubbled \nup during the reign of the ebullient Premier Nikita \nKhrushchev. The aging oligarchs have remained fixed \nin place, with few and unspectacular promotions and \nfew demotions from top ranks (those removed have been \ngenerally among the juniors). From October, 1964, to \nMay, 1977, the oligarchic coterie that overthrew Khru\xad\nshchev remained intact. The chief visible trend has been \nthe gradually increasing primacy of Leonid Brezhnev.\nA cabal forced Khrushchev out in October, 1964, \napparently mostly because he made them uncomfort\xad\nable. What followed seemed to be a truly collective \nleadership (resembling the leadership for a time after \nthe departures of Lenin and Stalin), in which no single \nindividual stood much above his several colleagues. But \nthe man who had the strongest control of the reins of \nthe party, the Secretary of the Central Committee, \nLeonid Brezhnev, was gradually able to forward his \nsupporters and remove rivals or potential rivals from \npower. By 1970, Brezhnev was the chief Soviet negotia\xad\ntor, although he apparently had to consult closely with \nthe Politburo. The 1971 party congress was largely \nBrezhnev’s show. More pictures of him kept appearing \nand quotations from his speeches became more frequent. \nThe cult of his personality came to surpass that of Khru\xad\nshchev at its height, and the 1976 party congress treated \nhim almost as deferentially as congresses treated Stalin. \nHis seventieth birthday, December 19, 1976, brought \nan imperial show of tribute to the great man. He was \ncalled vozhd, like Lenin and Stalin before him, the Rus\xad\nsian equivalent of the German Fuehrer or Italian Duce. \nSix pages of Pravda (expanded to eight for the occasion) \nwere filled with adulatory articles and speeches, and \nother papers were proportionally dedicated. In the fol\xad\nlowing week, one page daily (out of four or six) in the \nnewspapers was filled with congratulatory messages. \nBrezhnev received a sword of honor and the highest \ndecorations of the Soviet Union. A full-length docu\xad\nmentary of his career was released, in which the 40\nyears of Stalin and Khrushchev were elided and Brezh\xad\nnev seemed almost the direct successor of Lenin. A \nBrezhnev photographic album was published, and col\xad\nlections of his utterances, in print and on records, were \nmade available to the admiring, if not awestruck citi\xad\nzenry.\nThe master of ceremonies at the Brezhnev birthday \nfestivities was Nikolai Podgorny, President of. the Soviet \nUnion, that is, formally, President of the Presidium of \nthe Supreme Soviet. Podgorny did not earn enduring \ngratitude, however. On May 24, 1977, it was an\xad\nnounced that he had been relieved of membership in \nthe governing Politburo. He was far the most senior \nfigure to be ousted since Khrushchev. The action was \nbrusque, with no suggestion of age, ill health, desire to \nretire, or services rendered — Podgorny had been a Polit\xad\nburo member for 17 years and President since Decem\xad\nber, 1965 (when he was nominated by Brezhnev), and \nhad seemed in recent years frequently to rank next to \nBrezhnev. He was even permitted, like Brezhnev, to \nhave {iis bronze bust in his hometown in the Ukraine.\nPodgorny’s removal was foreshadowed by no appar\xad\nent loss of stature. Just two months earlier, he had made \nan. extensive and apparently successful tour of black \nAfrica, the first Soviet leader to do so. On May 20, he \nhad publicly received President Urho Kekkonen of Fin\xad\nland, and on May 23 he sent a congratulatory message \nfor President Tito’s eighty-fifth birthday. But after \nMay 24, decrees which should have been his were \nsigned by a deputy, his name ceased to be published, \nhis picture disappeared, and he joined the ranks of \nSoviet nonpersons.\nCommunist leaders in East Europe asked Western \nreporters to explain the ouster; but in view of the ex\xad\ntreme and apparently increasing secrecy of Soviet poli\xad\ntics, informed observers could only speculate. Some \nthought that he had been too tough on foreign and do\xad\nmestic policy for Brezhnev; and perhaps that he wanted \nto become more deeply involved in Africa. However, \ndifferences, if they were real, had never been sharply \nexpressed. Podgorny had been something of a rival for\n1 0 9\n', '1 1 0  •  CURRENT HISTORY, OCTOBER, 1 9 7 7\nBrezhnev in the last Khrushchev years and the rivalry \napparently continued quietly afterward. But Podgorny, \nwho as a Ukrainian was probably disqualified for the \ntop spot in any case, seemed to accept secondary status \nin good grace. It may have been to Podgorny’s discredit \nthat, although four years older than Brezhnev, he was \nconsiderably more vigorous. Brezhnev possibly saw \nPodgorny as a rival with an independent power base, \nas a potential danger or successor, if Brezhnev’s con\xad\ndition continued to deteriorate.\nThere must have been a sharp clash. Ordinary proce\xad\ndure has invariably been to drop a man from his main \ngovernment or outside job first, and only months later \nto expel him from the Politburo. The reversal of the \norder indicates that Podgorny was even more humiliated \nthan those who preceded him from the Politburo into \noblivion. The most probable explanation seems to be \nsimple: Brezhnev wished to add to his glory by making \nhimself head of state as well as party boss, thereby be\xad\ncoming by protocol what he had been de facto—a satis\xad\nfaction especially in dealing with foreign statesmen and \nreceiving full honors on foreign tours. Podgorny appar\xad\nently declined to vacate the post voluntarily, so he was \nbooted out in dishonor.\nA NEW CONSTITUTION\nThe expectation that Brezhnev would make himself \nchief of state was strengthened by the announcement, \nwhen Podgorny was expelled, of the forthcoming pub\xad\nlication of the new Soviet draft constitution, which \nfinally appeared on June 4. In 1961, Khrushchev had \nannounced that the 1936 constitution established under \nStalin should be replaced, and a drafting commission \nwas set up. After Khrushchev’s ouster, the commission \nwas headed by Brezhnev. On several occasions, it was \nsupposed to produce the fruit of its long labors, but there \nmust have been enough disagreement to postpone pub\xad\nlication year after year. However, by 1977 Brezhnev \nwas apparently in a position to override any dissension \nand to present what is perhaps to be his greatest monu\xad\nment, the new constitution, reflecting the condition of \n“developed socialism” in the Soviet Union. Perhaps it \nis to be called the “ Brezhnev constitution,” as its prede\xad\ncessor was for two decades called the “ Stalinist con\xad\nstitution.”\nThe draft clearly bears Brezhnev’s imprint but \nchanges are mostly cosmetic and so slight as to suggest \nthat it is called a new constitution for propaganda rea\xad\nsons. The most significant change is clearly tailored for \nBrezhnev: the powers of the head of state (and the \nPresidium under him) are expanded to make him over\xad\nseer of the administration; and he is provided with a \ndeputy, presumably to handle routine affairs. Other \nchanges seem designed to underline already effective \npolicies and positions, statements, so to speak, of the \ncondition of the Soviet state and its avowed aims.\nFor example, a declarative section on foreign policy \nis the most distinctive new feature. It has no specific \neffect, but sets forth the generalized Soviet stand on \ninternational affairs as the leadership sees it. It ex\xad\npresses the aims of creating favorable conditions for \ncommunism and strengthening the position of socialism \nin the world, of supporting “national liberation,” of \npreventing war, and of building on “peaceful coexis\xad\ntence.” It consecrates principles agreed to at Helsinki \non the non-use of force, territorial integrity, and the \nlike. At the same time, it implicitly sanctions interven\xad\ntion abroad in the name of socialist internationalism, as \npracticed in Czechoslovakia in 1968. To stand back \nnow, if “ socialism” were endangered in East Europe, \nwould be contrary to the constitution.\nThe section on rights is similarly expressive of the \nnon-unity of theory and practice. On the one hand, \nPravda has boasted that the rights of Soviet citizens \nwere substantially expanded over the already impressive \nlist in the old constitution. To the amenities to which \nSoviet citizens are entitled are added health care and \nhousing. The people are promised the right to use not \nonly the press but also radio and television, although \naccess to printing presses is dropped. The privacy of \ntelephone and telegraphic communication is promised. \nThe new constitution also provides, however, that “The \nexercise of rights and liberties by citizens must not \ncause damage to the interests of society. . . .” There is a \nlong list of duties, including defense of the interests of \nthe state, observance of labor discipline and intolerance \nof antisocial behavior; and the implementation of rights \nis made inseparable from the fulfillment of duties. The \npractical reality is exemplified not only by the notorious \nbugging of Soviet telephones but by the law that makes \nit a crime to use the telephone to the detriment of state \ninterests. In sum, Soviet dissidents will hardly be able \nto claim constitutional rights in the future, as they have \noften done, with only moral effect, in the past.\nThe new constitution furthermore spells out in much \nstronger language the ruling position of the Communist \nparty. Stalin’s constitution mentioned the Communist \nparty as “the vanguard of the working people.” By the \nnew draft, “The Communist party of the Soviet Union \nis the leading and guiding force of its political system, \nof all state and public organizations . . . .  [it] exists for \nthe people and serves the people.” In another new pro\xad\nvision, which changes nothing but which underlines the \npractice of the Brezhnev government, it is promised \nthat, to ensure the defense of the country, the state will \nfurnish the armed forces with everything they need.\nThe draft constitution also reflects the long-standing \npolicy of gradually reducing the status of the minority \nrepublics. There is no dramatic transformation, but \nvarious provisions reflect “ the strengthening of all- \nUnion principles,” as Brezhnev put it in his report to \nthe Central Committee. The anomalous and unreal\xad\nistic right of the republics to secede was retained, con-\n', 'B rezhnev’s Year: Politics in the U .S.S.R . • 111\ntrary to the expectations of many; but it was countered \nby an article holding that “the territory of the U.S.S.R. \nis united and includes the territory of the Union repub\xad\nlics.” Another article spells out rights of the central \ngovernment over the republics even more broadly than \nheretofore, including power over their organization and \nactivity and general authority to legislate for the entire \nUnion.\nThe new constitution is to be praised and discussed at \ncountless meetings across the Soviet Union, at which \namendments may be proposed; but it will probably be \nrubber-stamped without consequential changes by the \nSupreme Soviet in time for the November 7 sixtieth \nanniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. Nonetheless, \nBrezhnev did not wait for the constitution to come into \neffect; on June 16 he had himself elected President. \nThis was a position he held previously under Khru\xad\nshchev, from May, 1960, to June, 1964. In 1960, how\xad\never, the presidency was a setback in his contest for \nsecond place with Frol Kozlov, Khrushchev’s heir- \napparent. When he became ceremonial President in \n1960, Brezhnev lost his position of power on the Sec\xad\nretariat of the Central Committee. When Kozlov be\xad\ncame incapacitated in 1964, Brezhnev regained his \nsecretaryship, relinquished the largely ceremonial pres\xad\nidency, and found himself in line to succeed Khrushchev.\nNow, however, to don the hat of President, in addi\xad\ntion to those of General Secretary, chief of the defense \ncouncil, and marshal, is to make his status as boss virtu\xad\nally complete. The only top office he does not hold is \nthe premiership.\nBrezhnev is the first top Soviet leader to assume the \npresidency, which was occupied by nonentities until \n1 9 6 0 , w h en  B rezh n ev  h im se lf  d u rin g  h is  earlier  ten u re  \nvested it with some importance. Lenin was only Polit\xad\nburo member and Premier, and Stalin took the premier\xad\nship in the fullness of his power in 1941. So did Khru\xad\nshchev in 1958, when he had bested his chief rivals. \nConsequently, the joining of the positions of General \nSecretary (or First Secretary) of the party and Premier, \nor head of administration, has betokened dictatorship.\nHence, in the general acceptance of collective leader\xad\nship after Khrushchev was toppled, it was agreed among \nthe oligarchs and ratified by the Central Committee \nthat no one should combine the leading secretaryship \nand the premiership. The rule held, and for a few years \nit seemed as though Premier Alexei Kosygin was almost \nan equal partner of Brezhnev—theirs was referred to as \nthe “ Brezhnev-Kosygin” regime. As Kosygin, who was \nprimarily an administrator and never a candidate for \nsupremacy, lost ground and Brezhnev became the cen\xad\nter of a personality cult exceeding that of Khrushchev, \nit was several times rumored that Brezhnev might take \nover the premiership. He was perhaps deterred by the \nrule or by a disinclination to assume a greater admin\xad\nistrative workload. In any case, he solved the problem \nneatly by assuming the formally elevated title of Presi\xad\ndent in connection with the new constitution, making \nthe Premier subordinate.\nIn accepting the post, Brezhnev spoke modestly of \nhis sacrifice:\nThe discharge of the lofty and responsible state functions \nconnected with this, parallel with the duties of General \nSecretary of our party’s Central Committee, is, of course, \nno easy matter. But the will of the party, the will of the \nSoviet people, the interests of our socialist homeland have \nalways been for me the supreme law to which I subordi\xad\nnated and subordinate my entire life.\nCombination of the roles of party leader and state \nchief also confirmed, in Brezhnev’s words, the fact that \nthe party “has determined and will determine the key \nquestions of state life.”  Incidentally, Brezhnev implied \nthat Podgorny had been insufficiently cooperative with \nstrictly party leadership, that is, with Brezhnev. An\xad\nnouncing the new constitution and apparently aware \nthat this accumulation of offices would raise fears of \ndictatorship, Brezhnev reassured his people a few days \nearlier by taking a slap, almost for the first time, at the \nexcesses of Stalinism: “ The party strongly condemned \nsuch practices and they must never be repeated.”\nThe joining of the top positions in a single person \nclearly represents, however, an affirmation of authori\xad\ntarianism, if not autocracy, just as truly collective lead\xad\nership suggests something approaching constitutional\xad\nism, or at the least, restrictions on the arbitrary power \nof a single individual. The assumption of state powers \nby the party leader has apparently proved useful, or at \nleast unavoidable, in Communist countries generally. \nIn all Soviet bloc countries except Hungary and Poland, \nand also in China, Yugoslavia, Cuba and North Korea,\nth e  top  party  figu re  is th e  official h ead  o f  state , or in\nsome cases Premier; and Brezhnev explicitly said that, \nin drawing up the new constitution, “ account was taken \nof the experience of the constitutional development of \nfraternal socialist states.”\nFORMAL AUTHORITY\nThe new constitution represents a regularization of \nthe Soviet system, which has been in a sense an autoc\xad\nracy without a proper autocratic office; in the Marxist \nvision, after all, the state was to die away in the triumph \nof the new social order. Lenin was for the most part \nsimply the accepted and indispensable leader. Stalin \nbuilt up the position of first Party Secretary, which \nhad been unimportant before he took the title, and made \n{Continued on page 132)\nR obert G. W esson has published a number of books \non Soviet politics and related subjects, including The \nSoviet Russian State (New York: John Wiley, 1972), \nThe Russian Dilemma (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers \nUniversity Press, 1974) and Why Marxism? (New \nYork: Basic Books, 1976).\n', '132 •  CURRENT HISTORY, OCTOBER, 1977\nit was evident to the Kremlin that these Gulf countries, \nconfident in their possesion of new “oil power,” would \nfollow their conception of national interests, without \nregard to treaties, aid relationships, socialist solidarity, \nor other aspects of their relations with the U.S.S.R. \nEven Iraq, while proclaiming her solidarity with the \nSoviet Union whenever high level visits took place be\xad\ntween the two countries, was building up her relations \nwith the West, selling her oil for hard currency, and \nlooking to Europe, Japan and the United States for the \ncapital goods and technology needed for rapid develop\xad\nment. The Soviet Union, unable to compete with the \nWest either as a customer for oil or as a provider of \nhigh quality goods, saw its influence decline in the rich \nand dynamic Gulf region even as it was attempting to \nbuild power in the regions beyond, in the Indian Ocean \nand in Africa.\nSoviet fortunes in the Middle East in mid-1977 were \nindeed at a low ebb. They could hardly go anywhere \nbut up, if only because so much was expected of the \nUnited States, both from the Arabs and from Israel, \nthat United States diplomacy faced a nearly impossible \ntask. And every American misstep on the road to peace \nor the mere absence of success in a situation where there \nwas so much pressure for results would discredit those \nMiddle Eastern leaders who had looked Westward for \nsalvation and would open new possibilities for the Soviet \nUnion.\nSoviet policy is known for its patience and Soviet \ndiplomats are sure in the knowledge that the only cer\xad\ntainty in the Middle East is political change. Their \ncontinued buildup of military power strengthens the \nconfidence of Soviet leaders that their interests in the \nMiddle East and Africa will not be slighted or ignored \nby other powers or by local states. As the case of Angola \nshowed, they might be prepared to take increased risks, \neven to the point of using their own forces. But the \nsigns point to a continuation of the time-honored meth\xad\nods of political influence—the provision of arms, sup\xad\nport for “progressive” (i.e. pro-Soviet) elements, and \npropaganda. Patience is justified by caution, but also \nby the conviction that has sustained Soviet leaders from \nLenin to Brezhnev that, in the long run, the forces of \nhistory are on their side. ■\nSOVIET POLICY IN EUROPE\n{Continued from page 108)\nleaders can take comfort from the general support they \nreceive from West European Communists on most for\xad\neign policy issues. In the long run, this may be the most \nimportant aspect of Eurocommunism for the Soviet \nleadership.\nIn the short term, Eurocommunism is far more a \nchallenge for the West than for the Soviet Union. If a \nNATO country were to go Communist, could it remain \nin an alliance created as a defense against the Soviet\nUnion?. Can Communists be trusted with military \nsecrets? Will the Communists, once they are in power, \nbehave according to the rules of democratic politics?\nYet Eurocommunism also poses serious problems for \nMoscow. While the rising electoral popularity of West \nEuropean Communist parties may weaken the position \nof the bourgeois anti-Soviet opposition, what can Mos\xad\ncow do to prevent the virus of Communist diversity from \nspreading to East Europe? Would the success of West \nEuropean Communist parties encourage East Euro\xad\npeans to demand greater autonomy, thereby weakening \nthe Soviet grip on its Warsaw Pact members? Is diver\xad\nsity a prelude to the disintegration of Moscow’s hith\xad\nerto dominant position in East Europe? Is there a spill\xad\nover effect from West European communism to East \nEuropean communism?\nOBSERVATIONS\nFor the moment, no major crisis faces the Soviet lead\xad\nership. However, the Kremlin’s policy of drift and the \nrelative tolerance of the last decade may not be adequate \nfor the 1980’s. The Soviet Union faces an aging leader\xad\nship, an economy in chronic difficulty and a growing \ngap between the Soviet bloc and the West in many areas \nof technology. In a restive East Europe, human rights \nactivists are surfacing to bedevil the anxious authori\xad\ntarians in the party hierarchies. A point of no return \nmay be approaching in the strategic arms relationship \nbetween the Soviet Union and the United States. Thus \nthe Kremlin may soon have to come to grips with the \nnew realities that are emerging in a changing Europe. \nPower alone will not be an adequate substitute for a \ncoherent policy. The challenge goes to the very heart of \nMoscow’s imperial position. I\nBREZHNEV’S YEAR\n{Continued from  page 111)\nit the means of acquiring total control over the party \nand hence over the state. Only 19 years later did he \nassume the title of Premier. But the hold of a party \nsecretary on power is informal, resting less on the legal \nauthority of the office than on the command of a follow\xad\ning in the party; and the leader who is merely party \nsecretary may feel a little insecure. For the non-revolu\xad\ntionary, settled Communist system it is highly appro\xad\npriate that the leader be legally and formally what he \nis de facto, head of the state.\nThe presidency is, in any case, the pinnacle of power \nfor the onetime metallurgical engineer who rose mostly \nby making himself useful to Khrushchev, then stepped \ninto his place and with utmost patience for 13 years \nmoved his adherents up here and there and one by one \ndemoted those on whom he could not rely. He has all \nalong maintained forms of consultation, but he has now \nreached the point where he consults with persons de\xad\n', 'Articles Concluded •  133\npendent upon himself. Only two fairly independent \npersonalities remain at the top level: Kosygin, 72, who \nhas long been ailing and is probably more desirous of \nretiring than of challenging anyone; and Mikhail Sus- \nlov, who is 75 and who, as the party’s prime ideologist, \nhas never been very active in policy questions.\nBrezhnev has thus ascended the Everest of Soviet \npolitical power. There is nothing more for him to \nachieve, except perhaps a grotesque exaggeration of his \npersonality cult like that of Kim Il-song, the living god \nof North Korea. Ironically, while the political Brezhnev \nis thus exalted, the flesh-and-blood Brezhnev is deca\xad\ndent; he takes on unlimited political powers and new \nresponsibilities as his abilities wane. He has reportedly \nhad at least two heart attacks and is under close medical \nsurveillance. His face is usually puffy from some medi\xad\ncation. His hearing has suffered, and he conspicuously \nuses a hearing aid. He has some problem with teeth \nand/or jawbone. His speech is somewhat slurred and \nlabored. He is easily fatigued. His eyesight is poor, so \nthat he reads from typescript in oversize letters. Most \nserious of all, his mind, like that of China’s Chairman \nMao Tse-tung in his last years, shows signs of wear, \nas he loses the thread of discourse and has to stop and \nsearch for words.\nProbably Brezhnev has felt pressured to garner as \nmany laurels and as much glory as possible while his \nstrength holds out. It is possible that this has truly been \nhis year and that the rest of his life is anticlimax. In all \nprobability, Brezhnev wishes to avoid the fate of Stalin \nand Khrushchev as well as other former rulers of Com\xad\nmunist states, whose reputations turned to obloquy \nwhen they lost the ability to reward and punish. If so, \nhowever, his unceremonious erasure of Podgorny, like \nthe banishment of Khrushchev to oblivion, provides a \npoor precedent.\nTHE SUCCESSION\nBrezhnev has, however, apparently hesitated to \nundertake the most painful duty of an omnipotent ruler, \nto arrange his succession. No one is clearly in line. \nApparently closest to Brezhnev is his stand-in, Andrei \nP. Kirilenko, secretary in charge of industry. But Kir\xad\nilenko, who is actually a little older than Brezhnev, \nseems to have little personal standing aside from the \nconfidence of the chief. More promising might be \nFyodor D. Kulakov, secretary in charge of agriculture. \nHe has recently been treated as number five in protocol \nrank, and he is (at 59) one of the very youngest men \nnear the top. Sooner or later the present bracket of \nleaders in their seventies must yield. But they may \nresist as long as possible turning over power to a truly \npost-Stalin generation, not only because they like to \nhold power but also because they distrust those who \nhave not passed through the trials they underwent. \nThere has been no effort at all to move up-and-coming \nyoungsters nearer to the top; on the contrary, younger\nmen have frequently been replaced by older ones. For \nexample, at the meeting where Podgorny was removed, \nKonstantin F. Katushev, secretary in charge of rela\xad\ntions with foreign ruling Communist parties, aged 50, \nwas replaced by Konstantin V. Rusakov, aged 68.\nEven if he does not live much longer, Brezhnev has \nthe satisfaction of having placed his mark on Soviet \nhistory, of having remained as head of the ruling party \nlonger than any leader except Stalin. He can be proud \nof the order and stability over which he has presided \nand of the massive growth of Soviet military power.\nBut in terms of fulfilling Lenin’s dreams, his reign \nhas hardly been a success. Economic growth has slowed, \nand dependence on imports from the capitalist West has \ngrown. The governing apparatus has become ever more \nfixed, more of a ruling class. A new intellectual dissi- \ndence has arisen to turn the tables on what began as a \nparty of intellectual dissidents. Most of all, the Soviet \nUnion, which under Khrushchev still spoke in messianic \ntones, is no longer regarded as a model of the progres\xad\nsive. transformation of society and has acquired the \nimage of a staid bureaucracy, whose chief bureaucrat \nis Leonid Brezhnev. ■\nSOVIET AGRICULTURE\n(Continuedfrom page 122)\nTwo factors may reduce the dependence of the Soviet \nUnion on the United States for grain during the next \nfive to ten years. One is a result of the grain agreement, \nand the other is the striking change in the world grain \nsituation that has occurred since 1974.\nThe Soviet Union is able to minimize fluctuations in \nits grain imports by establishing a grain storage pro\xad\ngram, adding to stocks when grain crops are large, and \ndrawing from stocks when grain crops are small. In the \nrecent past, the government has permitted the demand \nfor grain to grow more rapidly than the domestic sup\xad\nply, so that even when there was a bumper crop, usage \nnearly equaled production. When grain crops were \naverage or below, net imports were required. The tenth \nfive year plan calls for a substantial increase in storage \ncapacity. If this program is carried out, it will be pos\xad\nsible to hold reserves large enough to meet most grain \nproduction shortfalls.\nIn fact, the imports required by the agreement may, \nthemselves, reduce whatever influence the United \nStates might have had over Soviet policy. If the Soviet \nUnion has a reasonably good grain crop in 1977 after \nthe 1976 bumper crop, it may have substantial stocks \nby the end of the 1977 crop year. Essentially, all its \nimports from the United States would be added to \nstocks, thus minimizing its need to import if there \nwere a poor crop in the future—as there will be.\nThe agreement plus actions taken to limit grain ex\xad\nports in prior years may well have convinced the Soviet\n']</pre>
