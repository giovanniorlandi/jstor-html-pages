FRIDAY, APRIL SO. 11117.\nVOLUME NLVIl; N I\' MB EH 32.\nJPrf\nDeath Calls\nRespected\nCitizen\nSENATOR JAMES A. DENTON DIES\nAT HIS HOME IN CALIENTE\n..FUNERAL LARGELY ATTEND\nED WAS PROMINENT IN POLI\nTICS IN THIS COl\'NTV.\nSome of the Beauties to be Seen at the Lincoln County Fair\nSeptember 20-23, 1917.\nl.-Louise\nTo Install\nBig Plant\nIn the death of former State Sen\nator Denton, which occured at Cal\niente on the 11th inst., Lincoln coun\nty has lost one of its most highly\nesteemed and respected citizens. He\nhad been in failing health for a\nnumber of years,; but until a day\nor so before his death relatives and\nfriends did not realize the serious\nness of his condition.\nThe deceased was born at Charles\nton, Iowa, April 2, 1849. He began\nhis march westward at the time of\nthe building of the Union Pacific\nrailroad, upon which he worked as\na contractor through Nebraska and\nWyoming.\nFollowing the completion, of this\ngreat, artery of commerce, he went\nto Bingham Canyon, Utah, then a\nprimitive mlny.ng camp, where he\ngained a knowledge of the milling\nand smelting of ores. Later, he was\ncalled to Stockton, Utah, where he\nbecame acquainted with the late\nW. S. Godbe, who was engaged In\nmining in that camp at the time.\nMr. Godbe gave him employment in\na smelter.\nAt the solicitation of Mr. Godbe,\nMr. Denton came to Nevada 41 years\nago; landing first at Hunter, then\na thriving mining town in White\nPine county, to which Mr. Godbe had\nextended his efforts. He was em\nployed as a smelterman.\nHe moved to Eureka, Nevada, in\n1876, having been offered a lucra\ntive jposition with the old Eureka\nConsolidated Mining company. He\nremained at Eureka until 18 80\nwhen he landed In Steptoe Valley,\nobtaining a good position with the\nowners of the Monitor mill, located\nin the old Taylor district. He was in\nTaylor during its palmy days and\nremained there for about nine years.\nIn the summer of 1889 Mr. Den\nton brought his family to Lincoln\ncounty. He landed at Pioche on the\n24th of July, little thinking at the\ntime that he would not return to\nWhite Pine. Again he met Mr. God\nbe, who wanted his services at Pi\noche where he had begun extensive\nmining operations.\nLater Mr. Denton branched out for\nhimself and became Interested in a\nnumber of stage lines In eastern\nNevada and western Utah.. He kept\nup this work until the coming of the\nSalt Lake Route and retired when\nDelamar was practically wiped off\nthe map by the closing of the Ham-borger-Delamar\nmine. . He took up\nhis residence at Caliente in 1901.\nThe deceased always took an ac\ntive part in politics and served this\ncounty in the lower house of the\nlegislature four terms and one term\nin the senate of Nevada, in which\ncapacity he served the county faith\nfully tad woll.\nIn recognition of past services to\nhis party, and following the first in\nauguration of President Wilson, he\nwas recommended by Senators New-\nAs a mark of respect to the de- HIGH SCHOOL BOARD\nparted, all of the Caliente buslne. 1 ASKS FOR FVIR SPCE\nhouses were closed during the hour i\nof the funeral There was a lar.Ke\noutpouring of townspeople, while\nfriend from Pioche, Panaca, Las\nVegas and oilier places were in attendance.\nThe Lincoln county high school\nboard is the first to make applica\ntion for exhibit space at the Lin\ncoln County Fair, to be held at Cal\niente next September.\nBOYLE APPOINTS MEMBERS I, M" , EU EdWanlS\' C he\nj board has written Geo.

R. Smith. The attendance\nts year is the largest in the his\ntory of the institution, which speaks\nvolunis for the work done for the\nschool by Prof. Smith.\nDEMONSTRATION TRAIN\nDUE AHANACA SOON\nThe Record has been advised by\nofficials of the Salt Lake Route that\nthe demonstration train ,will be at\nPanaca sometime next month, prob\nably about the 20th. On account of\nthe lateness of the spring it was de\ncided to postpone the trip until May.\nThe train will be much larger, the\nexhibits very materially greater than\nlast year. According to information\nat hand the train will consist of at\nleast 21 cars and It is expected that\nthe exhibits will include .everything\nin the way of farm implements used\nby successful western farmers. The\nexhibits of livestock will be an im\nportant feature of the display to\ncome from the agricultural college\nof the University of Nevada and the\nAgricultural College of Utah.\nThe work of the home economics\ndepartments of these schools will al\nso be an attraction (well worth see\ning and should interest every house\nwife in Lincoln county.\nm ms\nDOMESTIC SCIENCE\nGIRLS SERVE MEAL\nUnnatural Parents Try\nTo Abandon Children\nDistrict . Attorney Orr wiw called\nto Caliente early in the week to look\nInto a case where "unnaiuial" par\nents sought to abandon their twr,\ninfant children.\nIt appears that Bert Eldridge, a\nformer employee company, and\nhis wife, made an unsuccessful at\ntempt to make their get-away and\nleave the youngsters, one of them 3\nmonths, the other 2 years old, be\nhind. The couple were captured at\nLas Vegas and returned to Caliente\nby Deputy Sheriff Wm. Culverwell,\nwho placed them in jail pending an\ninvestigation\nThe case was brought before Jus\ntice of the Peace Palmer; the par\nents repented and were allowed to\ngo upon the promise that they would\ncare for the children and leave Lin\ncoln county for good. A subscription\nwas taken up, the family put on the\ntrain and away they went.\nIt is said that the woman cared\nso little for four children by a for\nhusband that she went away and\nleft them with hubby No. 1.\nThe couple are lucky, Indeed that\nthey do not have to spend a term\nin the penitentiary for their crime.\nAmong those present were Wm.\nE. Orr, Judge ("has. Lee Horsey,\n(\'has. Culver well, J. A. Clark F. W.\nDickie, and others. It was distinct\nly- a "sta;; aiiair and it is needless\nto say that a most enjoyable time\nwas had.\nSAYS RKCORD IS GOOD\nADVERTISING MEDIUM\nCOMPANY (JETTING READY FOR\nCAMPAIGN OF PRODUCTION\n.ENGINEER TO ltY OCT PLANS\nFOR EQUIPMENT A COMING\nDIVIDEND PAYER.\nSome weeks ago the Record\'s cor\nrespondent at Groom mentioned that\nthe transportation of ore from the\ninine to Indian Springs had been in\nterferred with because the caterpil\nlar tractor could not negotiate the\nsnow covered road.\nMr. C. O. Cross, representing the\nHolt Manufacturing company of\nStockton, Cal., declares that the Rec\nord is a good advertising medium\nand bases this conclusion upon the\nfact that the publicity given on the\noccasion mentioned has placed his\ncompany on the defensive. The head\noffice and salesmen have had to ex\nplain to prospective clients that the\ntractor which failed to move in cold\nweather was not the product of the\nHolt factory.\nV\nHe\nMiner Nay\nHave Been Murdered\nAN TO RESTRICT\nTRAFFIC IN LIQUOR\nThe domestice science girls of the\nLincoln County High school cooked\ntheir first meal last Wednesday and\nserved about forty people with a big\nlot of palatible things.\nThe young lades have been doing\nsome splendid work in this important\ndepartment, which can be fully at\ntested by those who particpated in\nthe feast at Panaca.\nFOOD EXPORTATION\nCAUSE OF SHORTAGE\nEnormous increase in the exporta\ntion of staple articles of food without\na corresponding increase in produc\ntion, and lack of intelligent econemy\nin buying by housewives, are as-\nscribed by the department of health\nof New York, in a report issued as\nthe chief reasons for steadily rising\nprices.\nThe department declared: "There\nlands and yl\'iitmaii for the appoint-1 does not appear to be any sudden\nment oto the U. S. Iud.an service I or recently developed emergency in\nana was assigned to Bishop, Inyo the food situation In this city, al-\ncounty.

Den\nton \'and L. H. Denton, of Caliente,\nbeing nephewe.\nThe funeral services were held\nat Caliente Electric Movie, hall, Cal\niente, last Friday afternoon, the ob\nsequies being conducted under the\ndirection of G. K. Riding and Judge\nChas. Lee Horsey, who were the\nPrincipal speakers. Interment took\nPlace in the Caliente cemetery.\nthough there has been serious riot\ning in various parts of the city."\nWhile the report asserts there Is\n"obviously less dependency and real\nneed than has been common for\nmany years past," it also says, "it\nis apparent that unless the present\nhigh prices of food are reduced or\ncontrolled, or as an alternative the\nincome of families which now main\ntain themselves on $800 a year or\nless, is Increased by raise of wages\nor through relief agencies, there will\nbe a constantly increasing number\nof people whose health will be Jeop\nardized by their inability to buy suf-\n. t\nHas G. (). Jacobson, a miner em-\nployed at the Prince Consolidat-\ned mine for several months past.\nmet with foul play?\nAt any rate, lie has dropped\nentirely out of sight and no\ntrace of his whereabouts has\nbeen found.\nThe theory that the man has\nbeen robbed and murdered is\nbased upon the fact that when\nhe left the Prince mine on the\n9th inst, he had about $400 in\ncash with him. Instead of de-\npositing his earnings in the hank\nfor safe keeping; he made it\nthe custom to carry his money\nin a belt strapped about his body\nSo it may be that someone knew\nthis and took advantage of the\nopportunity to way-lay him.\nSearching parties scoured the\nhills; old shafts and prospect\nhole have been looked into; but\nnot a clew has been discovered.\nSome of Jaeobsonis friends\ndo not hold to the idea that he\nbeen slain; but are inclined to\nthe belief that his absence is.\ndue to a temporary mental af-\ndiction and that he may yet\nturn up. Or that he has wand-\nered off into the hills and died\nfrom exposure.\nWhen Jacobson left the mine\nhe said he was going to Pioche\nand put on a new suit of cloth-\nes, which he had never worn.\nHe started out on the trail and\nthat is the last that was seen of\nhim. He had a month\'s pay com-\ning to him when he left for\nlabor performen during March.\nHe took none of his belongings\nfrom his room except the suit\nof clothes which he wore.\nJacobson is described as be-\ning a sober and industrious min-\ner. He had no bad habits and\nvas decidedly reserved. He was\na native of Sweden, light com-\nplected, and was commonly re-\nferred to among him companions\nas "Whitey, the Swede."\nEfforts were made by slier-\nHI fsesbitt to locate the miss-\ning man at Caliente; but evi\ndently he did not turn up there.\nficiently nourishing food at\nent prices."\nFigures\' are presented to show\nthat In cases in exports of staple\ngoods, have ranged from 36 per cent,\nin the case of mutton, to 1300 per\ncent in the case of cheese.\n"The figures do not indicate that\nthere Is any hoarding of food, or hold\ning of food for\'8peculative purposes\nIn this city," the report said.\npres- GRAND FEAST IN HONOR\nOF ED. CLARK, OF VEGAS\nSenators Borah of Idaho and Jones\nof Washington, utter conferences with\nprominent prohibition advocates, have\ndecided to lead a fight at the present\nsession of congress for radical nat\nion-wide prohibition legislation and\nwithin a few days will introduce bills\nembodying their ideas.\nThey believe that in view of the\ndeclaration of war the time is at\nhand when congress should go far to\nstamp out the liquor traffic in thase\nstates which have not yet enacted\nprohibition laws and point to simi\nlar action taken by the various Eu\nropean governments early in the war.\nThe senators first propose, by leg-\nslation to create dry zones around\nevery army post, encampment can\ntonment and maneuver grounds, in\nwhich no liquor shall be sold, and\ncreate similarity dry zones around all\nnaval stations and navy yards. A\nsecond bill will prohibit absolutely\nall interstate shipments of intoxi\ncating liijuor which is as far as con\ngress can go without amendment to\nuie constitution, a mini Dill con\ntemplated will greatly increase 4 he\ninternal revenue taxes on all liq\nuors, the purpose being to mako this\ntax all the traflic will bear.\nThe two senators realize that no\nimmediate results would be obtained\nfrom passing a resolution submit\nting a constitutional amend nerit to\nthe states for ratification, it would\ntake at least two years to make such\nan amendment effective, wheareas\nthe legislation they propose can be\nmade effective Immediately upon its\npassage.\nBoth senators are confident t ;.r n\nmajority can be secured in both\nhouses of congress, in support of\nthis legislation now that the United\nStates is at war, and Hey propose\nHojpress all three \'bills in the hope\nof securing their early adoption.\nWhile this legislation will no; make\nthe wet states dry, it will require\neach wet state to manufacture its\nown liquor, and the taxes, tlu sen\nators believe, will great y reduce\nconsumption because of t\'-.o result\nant increase of price to the consumer.\nA few of the many Pioche friends\nof Ed. W. Clark, county treasurer\nof Clark county and a leading bus\niness man of Las Vegas, gathered at\nthe home of his brother, J. A. Clark,\nlast Sunday, Just before midnight,\nand partook of a royal Teast pre\npared especially for the occasion.\nThe directors and etockliolders\nof the Virginl.vLouIiw ?ri.ii:ig com\npany held several meetings thio week\nand the Record is informed that\nplans have been practically complet\ned for the commencement of activ\nities at this big property; with the\ninauguration of an era of produc\ntion.\nThe next step in the campaign\nwill be the employment of a thor\noughly competent engineer to map\nout the program of equipping the\nproperty with modern facilities.\nThe present hoisting equipment\nConsolidated, lying adjacent, the ore\nis to be displaced by a very much\nlarger plant; with all of the acces\nsories necessary to handle ore upon\nan extensive scale and at the lowest\npossible cost.\nIt is understood that the manage\nment is (arranging to build a rail\nroad from the present terminus of\nthe Prince Consolidated line to the\nmine shaft, together with the re\nquired side tracks, etc., and Uie\nHoisting worKs anu ore bins will be\nso arranged that as the ore comes\nfrom the mine it will be dumped\nnto the railroad cars without any\nextra handling.\nThe mine is equipped with a ver-\ntical double compartment shaft, now\ndown 460 feet. Stations have been\ncut at the 320 and 450-foot levels,\nfrom which pjiuts drift have been\nrun to the south and the ore body\ncross-cut 145 feet. Like, the Prince\nConsolidated, ly\'au l.\'acei t. the ore\nbodies occur in beds, and the first\nof these beds la 120 feet thick. There\nare several of these beds, one of\nthem being 20 feet thick and carry\ning higher values.\nWhile there is a tremendous large\ntonnage of ore, in character almost\nidentical to the Prince Consolidated,\nnow available for eurastion; it Is\nproposed to kep the work of ex\nploitation going forward ana with\nthis object in view, the virgin ground\nsouth of Cue shaft will be developed\nand no doubt in this task diamond\ndrills will be employed to advantage.\nThe Virginia-Louise Mining com\npany was recently re-organized with\nJudge Chas. Lee Horsey, president;\nC. A. Thompson, secretary and treas\nurer; who, with Wm. It. Pitts, H. W.\nRand and Alex. Lloyd, constitute the\ndirectorate.\nThe bringing in of the Virginia\nLouise will materially increa&e the\ntonnage of ore going from this dis\ntrict; which will be very gratfying,\nindeed; but more so to the stockhol\nders of the company, who may look\nforward to reaping dividends in the\nvery near future. With \'the Prince\nalready- a velvet getter and the Vir\ngin about to enter that class, the\npart of the district where they are\nlocated will certainly be "doing"\nthings in the right way.\nNO INCREASE IN SALOONS\nIN THE CITY" OF RENO\nBall Gume at Panaca Tmlav\nA game of base ball is scheduled\nfor Panaca today between Pioche and\nthe high school nine. The game will\nbe called this afternoon.\nGeorge Karakas returned yester-.\nday from a trip to Salt Lake City.\nLast week the Reno city council\non motion of Cuncilman Frisch, de\nclared its opposition to the grant\ning of any more liquor licenses any\nwhere in the city, except to grant re\nnewals to present holders or to rec\nognize the transfer of a license from\nits present holder to a new owner of\nthe same business. The action of the,\ncounsil came as a direct surprise and\nwas precipitated by the refusal of\nthe council to grant a license to the\nElite cafe, owned by Terrtll and\nKing.\nGeo.

The war ended witli\nthte surrender of Cornwallis at York\ntown. Although there was no formal dec\nlarations of war, there were sea bat\ntles with French warships in 1798,\nand again with Tripolitlan pirates in\n1801. These were caused by French\nnaval officers taking men from our\nships for service in France, and by\npirates who endangered our com\nmerce in the Mediterranean.\nThe practice of "impressing" Am\nerican citizens into Itritish service,\nafter taking them off American ves\nsels caused the war wi\'h England\nin 1812. That ended in 1815. The\nwar cost the United States $200,\n000,000 and 30,000 men.\nWhen Texas declared its freedom\nin 1846 and a dispute arose over\nthte boundary line, the United Stat\nes was drawn into the war, which re\nsulted in a victory two years later.\nMexico, as a result, ceded Califor\nnia and New Mexico to the United\nStates and the Rio Grande was set\ntled upon as the Mexican-Texas boun\ndary. The Spanish-American war in\n1898 lasted from April 21 to Dec\nember 10th, and was followed by\nour occupation ofthe Philippines and\nquelling their, revolution.\nAside from the foreign wars, there\nWas the Civil war, from 1861 to 1865\nfollowing the secession of the south\nern states from th\' Union on the\nquestion of slavery and the plea of\nBtates\' rights.\nThe war ended with a Ijss of\nmore than 700,000 men and a to\ntal cost of about $3,000,000,000.\nThe result was a closer naicn of the\nUnited States and abolition of Slav\nery.\nUK WILL HE MISSED\nCaliente.will not seem like it used\nto be without Senator James A. Den\nton. That good old soul has been\nfeathered to his father\'s, and no more\nwill we be greeted by that hearty\nhand shake; that kindly smile and\ngenuine cordiality, whic was so char\nacteristic of him.\nIt was always a source of pleasure\nto the writer to meet Senator Den\nton; hundreds of others enjoyed be\ning in his sunny presence and to re\nceive that wholesouled greeting. He\nwas kind and generous to a fault.\nIn politics, in which he loved to\ntake part, he always displayed the\nBternng qualities of manhood. No\nmatter how bitter the campaign wag\ned, it was not in him to speak ill of\nhis opponent; nor by innuedo or oth-\nerwise to try and tear down the\ncharacter of anyone Just because they\nmight be against him.

Chicago, lit.\nThe farmer\'s bon i-s becoming a\nbetter mechanic every year, as in\ndeed is necessary if he keeps up with\nall that is new in the line of farm\nmachinery The most complex ma\nchines on our ranches today are\nthose used for hasvesting, says E. K.\nThomas, an expert along these lines.\nThe assistant manager of a large\nimplement house remarked recently\nthat in his younger days he had often\nbeen called to make a long ride mere\nly to thread up a binder.\nWhen he sold the machine he was\nobliged to help set it up and go\nalong with the man to start it at\nwork in the field.\nAs it is now, this man remarked,\nthey sell the farmer a binder and his\nson comes along, takes the crated\nmachine to the ranch, sets it up and\ngoes to work.\nThe gasoline is no longer the new\nfangled toy for the farmer who is\nalways trying every new thing that\nconies along, but is the servant that\nmust obey this new mechanic. While\ndriving along by a field of wheat\nlast summer, a familiar sound greet\ned my ears as I passed a young fellow\nbinding his grain.\nIt was the steady bark of a gas\noline engine. The there horses were\nwalking along at a brisk gait as\nthough they were taking the binder\nalong the road. Mounted on a brack\net at the back of the machine was a\nsmall engine that was running the\ncutting and binding machinery.\nWhile I knew that this device had\nbeen used for sometime, and that en\ngines are put out especially for this\nwork, it was the first time I had\nseen it here in the west.\nIn the grain belt a period of wet\nweather at harvest time sometimes\nmeans the loss of a good crop. The\ndrive wheel will mire down or slide\nalong and the machinery stops.\nWhen binder runs with difficulty\nit requires extra horses and is very\nhard work for them at that. The\nengine mounted so as to drive th\nmachinery leaves the horses merely\nthe work of pulling the weight of th\nbinder. This enables the farmer t\ncut his grain with ease when it\nwould he impossible to use the bind\ner in the ordinary way. In this case\nthe groud was dry, yet he was usin\nan engine.\nHere was something worth inves\ntigating. This young Colorado far\nnier had reasoned that harvest wa\nusing an extra team that he did not\nneed to keep for the other worl\nwhen properly planned. By using th\nengine he could do without this ex\ntra team of horses.\nNot only that, but his three horses\nwere cutting at least two acres\nday more than five could do In the\nold way, and were doing it much\neasier.\nThe engine is used for other work\naround the ranch when not in us\non the binder. It worked so well o\nthe binder that this man fixed up h\npoiaio digger so mat tne engin\nthe elevator and shaker.\nTwo horses can then pull the dig\nger with ease. This young farnie\ninterested me and I determined t\nlearn something more about hi\nmethods.\nI noted that in place of the men\nfollowing the binder and making u\nround of the field for every row of\nshocks, as they did In the field across\nthe road, that the field had been cut\nin two parts and the men were shock\ning in the part that had been finish\ned.\nThey were following the windrows\nof bundles, and the rows of shocks\nthey had set up lined almost as well\nas the fence posts. When asked if the\nmen were not taking more care than\nwas necessary, the boss laughed and\nsaid: "There is the reason for that,\'"\npointing to a team that was coming\nInto the field with a disk.\nHe went on to say that he had\ndecided that his men were taking too\nmany unnecessary steps.for which he\nwas paying, when they followed the\nbinder setting up the shocks of grnin.\nThey were kept at other work un\ntil a piece was cut. By working along\nthe windrows instead of across it\nmuch less time and energy was used\nin getting from one shock to the next.\nIt took no longer to set up the shocks\nin straight rows than the other way,\nand It made disking much easier.\nIf he could dump the bundles In\nstraight windrows the men could set\ntthe shocks in straight rows.\nWhen asked about the disking this\nman gave two reasons for it. The\nsooner the ground Is disked the more\nmoisture it will have wehe.t th3 time\ncomes to plow.\nBy disking the ground befgrg\nplowing a better union Is forl\nat the bottom of the furrow anT KT?\norganic matter present is worked In\nto the soil in better co\'id\'t\'ot For\ntthe districts where littlo of the\nstraw is saved and where soil fertil\nity has not yet become u seriou\nproblem, a machine has t een design\ned to harvest wue.u from the stand\ning straw witho.it cutting It in the\nusual fashion.\nThis machine has a large blower\narrangement, which forces the heads\nof wheat back against a rapidly re\nvolving cylider similar to those in\nan ordinary grain separator, threshes\nthem out, cleans the grain and de\nlivers it in sacks at the back of the\nmachine.\nThis outfit has been tried in sev\neral places on the plains but can\nardly be classed as more thafl an\nattempt so tar. In most oi tne pro\ngressive districts the farmers are\nlearning to save the straw and would\nnot be much impressed by sucli a machine.\nOne of the small improvements on\ninders is the addition recently of a\nset of comb teeth on outside edge\nof the reel bars.\nThese teeth tend to hold the grain\nmore evenly, so that it strikes the\ncanvass without massing together or\nangling.\nplication to the State Engineer ef Tds\nor B-rmiEsim to sppropriato the public ma\nter, of the fetate of Nevad.
