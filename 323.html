The world\n?? must be made safe for democracy,\n. and this can be done only by mak-j\ning the trenches safe for the solgf\nARE WE TO BE GERMANY\'S\nACCOMPLICES?\nIpfeg \'."It is time to act in Russia," says\nW&? ex-President Taft, writing in The\n|&?v Philadelphia Public Ledger. It is\nrather more than time. It was time\n! to act in Russia long ago. The question\nis whether there is still time to\nac in Russia, and, if there is, how\nlong there will continue to be time\nto act in Russia. Germany is eatI\ning the country up in great mouthi\nfuls. To Germany it was "time to,\nj act in Russia" the moment the Czar\nI was overthrown, and Germany began!\n| acting then with immense skill and\nenergy and has not lost a minute or;\na second since. "For want of a\ndefinite policy," says a writer in The j\nLondon Times, "we day by day are [\n"losing the chance even to rebuild I\n"upon the ashes of Russia." This!\nwriter foresees the re-establishment;\nj of order in Russia by Germany after j\n| the present German-planned con-:\nj fusion has reduced the country to |\nI the lowest point, and in the future, I\n"a Russian-German alliance again I\n"menacing the peace of the world at j\n"a dozen points." And he says:\nThe first steps have already\nbeen taken by the Germans, and\nwhile the Allies puzzle over\ntheir on policies, the Germans\nhave policies which the offensive\non the western front on an\nunprecedented scale has not diverted\nthem a hair\'s breadth\nfrom carrying on.\n"While the Allies puzzle over their\nown policies." That is the very core\nof it. When shall we have unity of\ncounsel, if not unity of command,\nin the political field? Is there anything\nto show that the Allies even j\nconsult with each other about the\nquestion of having a policy? They\nconsult each other, we know, but it i\nalways appears that they do their\nconsulting only over some immediate\nquestion of the moment, as when\nFrance submitted to England Kaiser,\nKarl\'s letter to Sextus. The ideaj\nof planning out a policy, such as\nGermany plans out, has never occurred\nto them, so far as any evi- \'\ndence goes to show. When shall we\nhave a political board of strategy\nand a political Foch?\nHere the world is confronted with \'\nthe mnst, frightful menace \' conceiv\nable; a menace even more frightful\nthan the menace of the present German\nEmpire. For we can beat the\npresent German Empire, we believe;\nbut the whole world could not beat\na German-Russian Empire with its\nmuscles in Russia and its brain in\nBerlin.

A. Rowell.) f\nMr. H. J. Power, of Brownlees,\nis doing some good farming?he is\nliving and boarding at same place, i\nand, at the same time is building up |\nhis land, thereby leaving it better:\n*1 it. ...? ? i?_ ?: i ?????? !\niuaix iw was w:icit nc gaincu pv/oocosion\nof it. He is planting all the\nfood and feed crops necessary to\nsupply his family and livestock and\nsome in excess for his country. Mr.\nPower says that one of the most im-j\nportant men during the\' war is one\na\' \' I\nwho is farming, not one who plants!\ntwo-thirds of his land in cotton, but;\none who is providing for food and\nfeedcrops. Yet, in this war time,\nwhen there are thousands of hungry\npeople in this world looking to America\nfor food, we have farmers\nright at home who are planting 18\nacres of cotton to the plow and only\nfour acres of corn, and who are\nJbuying their meat, part of their\ncorn, and all of their flour from the\nWest and North. Is this patriotism?\nDuring the past two very cold\nI winters, Mr. Power has m%de. two\ngood grain crops, despite the cold\nwinters, and a great many other\nfarmers have failed in their grain\n, crops. Mr. Power has a very small\nfamily, runs a four horse farm, yet\nhe is planting 20 acres of -oats, -8\nacres of wheat, one acre of rye, 24\nacres of corn, 3-4 acre of sweet potatoes,\nnever buys any meat, has\nplenty of pasture for io cows, and\nis raising plenty of chicjcens.\nMr. Power expects td thrash out\n700 bushels of 08ts from 20 acres, .\nwill make 80 bushels ofi wheat from\n8 acres and 12-15 bushels rye from\nr one acre. He has all the oats neces\nsary to ao nira ana win sen zuu du. i\nThese oats are worth $1;25 per bu.\nbut they never cost him $0.50 per\nbushel. Now see if you can buy !\nthem for 50 cts per bushel!\nMr. Power believes in good farm- i\ning, he is getting a pleasure out of j\nfarming. He says the older he gets ,\nthe more he wants to learn about\nfarming. He started to farming aj,\ngood many years ago, and his motto ^\nwas, "First, ditch and terrace . your j\nland properly, rotate your crops,]\nplant your stubble land to peas, j\'\nv turning some of them under every \'\nyear, and you will make\' poor land j\'\'\nbloom like a rose in five years." ^\nWhat would be the result if every 1\nfarmer followed the example? We ^\nwould have a more prosperous coun- ^\ntry to live in, we would get more 5\nout of life, our land would be 1\nbuilt up, and we would not have to?1\nbuy a bushel of corn, a pound of :\nmeat or lard, a bushel of oats nor \'\nr\nany hay, or a sack of floui; from the\nNorth and West. ,, ^ 1\n. . r0,..: \' \'\n. BUILD A SILO THIS SUMMER. 1\n* <\nThe silo is an air-tight receptacle ^\nI for preserving- green tfeed in its J ?\nsucculent Condition. The silo is no 1\nlonger ah experiment, it went thru s\nthe experimental stage years ago. 1\nAnyone that knows anything at all ?\nabout a silo knows that is true. Sil- j (\nage is now universally recognized ]\nas one of the cheapest and most in- 1\ndispensable feeds in the economical! s\n. production of milk and beef. | i\nA silo is not needed by a man 1\nI\nwho does not keep ten or more head j 1\nof cattle (either beef or dairy) or 11\ndoes not grow the material with ^\nwhich to fill it. But any man keep- <\ning ten or more head of cattle, re- j <\ngardless of type, should have a\' i\nsilo. If one doubts the value of a; <\nsilo all that is necessary for him to I j\ndo is to go to those men who havej \\\nbuilt them, or go to Tennessee or; i\nIndiana. You will find that men i\nwho own silos are more than pleased; i\nwif-h t.hpm. I i\nI We all know very well that a cow J ]\ngives more milk when turned on j <\npasture. When a cow is turned on j <\npasture her flow of milk increases;j]\nwhen she is taken off the pasture the 1\nflow of milk decreases. In the feed- j ]\ning of.fowls for increased egg-pro-j]\nduction, valuable lessons may bej.\nlearned from the natural habits of i;\nthe birds. As a rule, fowls lay j ]\nmost abundantly in the spring of i\nthe year, particularly if left to shift I <\nfor themselves. If given free range 11\nat this season of the year they ob- j i\n>\nt. \' \'\' .Xv! - f\'\nv \' r\\ y \\ f\' V \'\nlie Farmer\ntain green food in the form of\ngrass, meat in the form of worms :\nand insects, and broken rocks. If\nwe expect to feed fowls for increased\negg-production, it will be neces- !\nsary to prolong the sprink-like condition\nas much as possible throughout\nthe entire year. If we expect,\ntherefore, to produce the most\nbutter or beef at the least cost, we\nshould prolong throughout the entire\nyear pasturue-like condition.\nMore butter and beef can be pro- 1\nduced and produced more cheaply 1\nfrom feeding silage than from any *\nother method of feeding that does \'\nnot include silage. Records show 1\nthat the feeding of silage to cattle 5\nat the Indiana Experiment Station\nfor eight years produced a profit of 1\n$15,24 per head against $8.85 per 5\nhead for those fed no silage, or *\n$6.39 in favor of feeding silage. The 5\nsilo provides plenty of succulent \'\nfeed during the winter and is rel- s\nished by cattle. More feed can be J\nstored in the same place in the form\nof silage than can be stored in the 1\nform of hay and fodder. An acre s\nof land planted to silage crops will <\nproduuce more feed than the same s\nacre will produce if planted in any s\nother, crop. Summing up, these are 1\nthe advantages of silage: (1) It is <\ncheap, succuluent, and palatable, \'\n(2) it is a substitute for pasturue, \'\n(3) can be stored in a very small ?\nplace, (4) it is convenient and ban- 1\ndy to feed, (5) there is no waste in J\nfeeding silage, (6) the largest amount\nof feed can be produced \'\nfrom an acre of land, and (7) more <\nbutter and beef can be produced 1\nmost economically from feeding sil- 1\nage than from any other method of <\nfeeding that does not include silage. 1\n" For the man that has ten or more <\nhead of cattle the building of a ^\n3ilo wouM be the greatest invest- 1\nmerit he could possibly make. There *\nare five silos in McCormick County 1\nand none of the. owners regret hav- 1\ning ever built them; they will tell ^\npou they are worth about twice what (\nthey cost. There is one man in the (\nstate who says he can afford-to build 1\na \'wood hoop silo every year.\nThere are two types of silos in 1\ncommon use?the concrete and the\nwood hoop. As to which type a man\nshould build will depend very largely\non certain conditions. The man ^\nou-Vin Vine pnnnch rattle to iustifv\nDuilding a silo and is not able to *\nDuild a concrete silo shouid build\ni wood hoop silo. A wood hoop silo\nivili cost arotind $1.25 per ton capacity,\nthat is, a 100 ton wood hoop\nsilo will cost about $125, depending\n)n the labor and cost of materials,\nrhese figures are based on bought\nnaterials. By sawing the tongue\nmd grooved flooring the silo should\nlot cost more than $90 or $100. For\njxample, it will take around 2000\nFeet of floring to build a 100 ton ^\nsilo, costing $70. If a man own the j\ntimber and has to pay only for the 1\njawing, the silo should not cost, ^\nperhaps, more than $75, including,\nJO bags of cement costing $24. Aj\n:oncrete silo will cost about $3.00.\'\n; t\nper ton capacity, or $300 for a 100 ^\n;on sila. If a man is keeping a t\nsmall herd of cattle and expects to\nncrease it later on, it will pay to c\n> >\nwild a wood hoop silo. When he j\nlas 50 or more head of cattle he car. ^\n;hen put up a concrete silo. The j.\nivood hoop silo is a step toward tht ^\nconcrete silo; it will help you buildj j\nx concrete silo. So far as the keep- s\ning quality of the silage is con- ?\nq urAnH Vinnri Qilo iq ilist. as _\n" ""? I s\n*ood as the concrete silo. An air- ?\ntight receptacle is all that is neces- f\nsary to preserve silage. There are\nno doubt many farmers who have r\nnever built silos that really needed j\nthem and wouFd have been a paying 5\nproposition, but never built be- (\n:ause they could not put up a con- ]\nirete silo, thinking they would not t\npay. As a matter of fact some of j\nthe leading silo men will say always j\nbuild a wood hoop silo and put the\nbalance of the money in good cattle, i\nA. wood hoop silo is so simple that\' j\nalmost anybody can build one and I\ntrnild it in tnree aays too. ^\nThe size of the silo will depend, c\nof course, on the nuumber of cattle j\nbo be fed. It is necessary in the j\nsouth to feed silage not less than (\nfour and a half months, or 135 days\nIt takes 40 pounds of silage per da]\nper head, or 5400 lbs. of silage foi\nfour and a half months. To feet\n50 head of cattle 135 days in th<\nsouth will require 135 tons of silage\nTo be sure of a silo large enough i\nwill be necessary to construct on<\n40 feet high and 16 feet in diametei\nor one that will hold 147 tons. Th<\nfollowing are some of the dimen\n3ions of silos, together with tht\nnumebr of cattle that each one wil\ncarry for 135 days:\nDimensions. Capacity.

Cotr\nmakes a better silage but you car\nlount on sorghum making 25 pei\n:ent more tonnage per acre. Corr\nwill average around 6 or 7 tons anc\n?orghum 9 to 10 tons of silage pei\nacre. On good land you can expecl\nmore silage per acre from bott\nsorghum and corn, but the abOvt\nfigures are for average land in th(\nsouth. I should think the bottom\nlanas ot ADDeviiie uounty snouic\niverage 12 to 15 tons of sorghurr\n>rlage per acre.\nThose considering building silof\n:his summer should get their cropj\nitarted, then consider on the type\n)f silos they expect to construct. Ii\ni concrete silo is built, it is necessary\nto order the material severa\nmonths ahead of time, owing to the\ncongestion of freight. If a wooc\nloop silo is built all you have to d<\nis ^to order 8 or 10 bags of cement\nsaw your flooring early this summei\nmd let it dry, an<J saw the hoopf\njusuf when you get ready to build.\nThe silo is like the potato storage\nlouse, will pay for itself in nearlj\n)ne year.

Then yot\n:an use the. wood hoop silo for sin\n>r seven years in the future and\n;he concrete for a life time.\n-IOW TO SUCCEED\nWITH ALFALFA\n(W. A. Rowell, County Agent.)\'\nFor a great number of years il\nlas been the opinion of some peo>le\nwho believed that alfalfa would\nlot succeed in the cotton belt ex:ept\non certain limited areas, Whilt\nhis might be true to a certain exent,\nit is by no means true with\nill soils. Alfalfa will not, of course;\nmcceed on poor sandy soil. Observation\nand experience have taughl\nne that alfalfa will do well over a\nrery large area of the cotton belt\nprovided, certain conditions are\nnade right. I see alfalfa growing\nn nearly every section of Abbeville\nbounty, and growing on upland too,\nf alfalfa will succeed on upland in\nAbbeville County, I am convinced\n;hat it will do well on almost any\nloil in the county.\nAlfalfa is an excellent hay plant,\njiving three to five cuttings each\n:ear, and averaging three-fourths\no a ton of excellent hay at each\n:utting. There is no feed that is\nio nutritious and palatable as al\'alfa\nhay, there is no crop that will\nrield as much feed per acre with\nhe sameamount of labor. Once you\njet it started it is good for years.\nhave had farmers tell me that\ntock will stop eating corn for good\nilfalfa hay. Now that labor is\nicarce I believe more farmers\nihould put in a small patch of al\'alfa\nnext fall.\nIf one expects to grow alfalfa he\nnust bear in mind the following:\nL. The land must be fairly rich.\n!. Well drained. 3. in good physi\n^ 1 1 : 3 n\n:ai condition. <i. supp^eu wan u\niberal application of lime, and 5,\nhe seed must be inoculated with the\n)roper bacteria and sown at the\n>roper time.\n1. Alfalfa will grow all right or\ni fairly rich soil, this has been\njroven. I do not believe it should\n>e sown\' on poor land, because it\nvill not succeed. But poor land\n;an be made fertile enough to grow\nilfalfa in two years time by plowng\nunder some legrme, such as\n:owpeas, velvet beans, and, the ap\n? plication of barnyard manure.\n7 2. Good drainage is necessary\nr to grow alfalfa. This is because too\n* much water in the soil excludes the\n?\nair, hence the oxygen, that is absot\nlutely essential to the growth of all\n? plants and animals. But drainage\nr is no great problem in Abbeville\n- County, so we do not have to worry\nabout that, except on the bottom\nj lands.\n3. The soil must be in good phy1\nsical condition. By good, physical\ns condition I mean that the land must\nbe broken deeply and subsoiled and\nthoroughly cut up with a disk harrow.\nThe soil should be finely pulr\nverized before sowing seed by runj\nning smoothing harrow: over it.\nx 4. Lime is absolutely necessary\nr for the successful growth of alfalfa,\nit will not thrive in a sour soil.\nGround limestone should be applied\nbefore planting at the rate of 4 or\n5 tons per acre, and. harrowed in.\n5. Another thing necessary is\ninoculation. The seed should be\ninoculated with government free\nculturue, or wet seed with a mixture\nof equal parts of molasses and\nwater and add all the . inoculated\nsoil the seed will hold. Another way\nto inoculate is by hauling a 1000\nlbs. of soil from a field of alfalfa\nor melilotou and brbadcasting on the\nland where alfalfa is to be planted.\nSow the seed as soon as possible i\nafter middle of September.\nTo grow alfalfa \' then we must\nhave a fairly rich soil, if the soil\nis not rich enough make it rich. After\nsmall grain broadcast 15 or 20\nloads of barnyard manure per acre,\nthis will give time for the inanure\nto decompose and for the seed to\nbe killed out. If you do not have\nthe manure, break land after small\ngrain, sow 300 lbs. fertilizer per\n\'I nr fwrt narta of nhoaohate and\none part of cotton seed meal. Sow\n| your peas in three rows and cultivate\nto keep down weeds. When\ni\nf peas are mature cut up with disk\nharrow and turn under, then sow\ni\nbroadcast 4 or 5 tons of limestone\nj per acre and harrow in well. After.\ngod rain broadcast 500 lbs. phos|\nphate per acre and. harrow in. Then\nwhen the first good\' season comes\nI\nalong sow your seedvat the rate of\n| not less than 40 lbs. per acre and\ncover lightly with harrow or brush.\nWeedg are the worst enemy of alfalfa^\ntherefore it is necessary to\'\ntry to have the land as free of then\nL as possible before planting- by\nkeeping the land cleanly cultivated .\nbefore sowing. It is best to so*\nthe seed in" the early fall, rather\nI than in the spring.\nKeep Your Alfalfa Patch Fertilized.\nAlfalfa should be fertilized \'every\ntwo or three years during December\n[ or January. Broadcast barnyard\nmanure every other year if possibte\n\' and run disk harrow, over \' alfalfa;\nl During the latter part of February\nL apply broadcast 500 lbs. phosphate\nper acr4 and harrow in well. About\n, the fourth year it will be best to\n, apply limestone about February* and\nU?w?.an> U TUa oI^qI\'Tq mn?f\nj uariUYv it , in vrcti. 1110 ?uim?\nbe properly tt-eated if one expects\n, to get good-uefcarnB from it. FerI\ntilization and the \' application of\nr barnyard manure are. necessary ev->\nery two or three years, and lime\nshould be applied every founor five\ni years because it is not expected to\nt last more than four years.\n, Cut alfalfa when the next shoota\ni (young plants) begin to appear\n. above the ground; this is about\nI blooming time.\nI TIRO), NERVOUS\nmm >\ntVMVINl\nNow Sh& U Strong and Well\nBerkeley, CaL?"I was nervous*\nirritable, no appetite, could not sleep.\ni and was -always tired, so my housework\nwas a great effort.

DARKEN\nYOUR W HAIR\nUse Grandma\'s Sage Tea and\nSulphur Recipe and Nobody\nwill Know.\nThe use-ofrSage and Sulphur for re trains:\nfaded, gray hair to lta natural\ncolor dates back to grandmother\'s\nthine. She used It to keep her hair\nto&utifully dark, glossy and attractive.\nWhenever her hair took on that\nfaD, faded or streaked appearance,\nHrfa irimnle mixture was aDDlled with\nwonderful effect\nBut brewing at home Is mussy and .\nout-of-date. Nowadays, by asking\' at\nany drug store for a bottle of "Wyeth\'s\nStage and Sulphur Compound," you\nwin get this famous old preparation,\nimproved by the addition of other Ingredients,\nwhich can>be depended upon\nto restore natural colOr and beauty\nto the hair. r\nA well-known downtown drugglBt\nays It darkens the hair so naturally\nmid evenly that nobody can tell It ha*\nbeen applied. Tou simply dampen a\nponge or soft brush with it and dra-w\nthis through your hair, taking one\nstrand at a time. By morning the\nCray hair disappears, and after, another\napplication or two, it becomes\nbeautifully dark and glossy.\nWyeth\'s Sage and Sulphur Compound\nIs a delightful toilet requisite\nfor those who desire a more youthful\nappearance. It is not Intended foi\nthe cure, mitigation or prevention ol\nilwm.\nI Hot Water for\nSick Headaches\nTell* why everyone should drink 1\n(hot water with phoephate\nIn It before breakfast.\nHeadfedto of any kind, is caused by\n?Bti?into*h?iUon?which means self\npoisoning. Liver and bowel poisons\n\' ttlted: toxlta, sucked into the blood,\ntfcrough the lymph ducts, excite the\nart which pumps the blood so fast\ntkst congests In the smaller arteries\nad veto* of the head producing violent,\nthrobbing pain and distress, called\nheadache. You become nervous, despondent,\nsick, feverish and miserable,\nyour meals sour and almost nauseate\nyou. Then yon resort to acetanllide,\naspirin or the bromides which tempor.\narily relieve but do not rid the blood of\n\'?*se irritating toxins.\n-- A glass of hot water with a teaspoonful\nof limestone phosphate in it, drank\nbefore breakfast for awhile, will not \\\nonly wash these poisons from your system,\nan* cure you of headache but will (\n. cJeanse, purify and freshen the entire\n! Alimentary canal.\n7 Ask your pharmacist for a quarter\nfoonml of limestone phosphate. Itis inVxpernsire,\nharmless as sugar, and al- 1\nmost tasteless, except for a sourish (\ntwinge wnicn is not unpie&siuiu\nIf you aren\'t feeling your best, If .\n\'tongue la coated or you wake up with\nbad taste, foul breath or have colds, 1\nIndigestion, biliousness, constipation\nor bout, acid stomach, begin the phos- j\nphated hot water cure to rid your {\nsystem of toxins and poisons. ,\nResults are Quick and it Is claimed 1\nthat those who continue to flush out\nthe stomach, liver, and bowels every J\nmorning never have any headache or 1\n\' know a miserable moment <\n\' - ]\nMEAT CAUSE OF ,\niNEY TROUBLE\nI\n???? I\nbke a glass of Salts if your Back\nharts or Bladder bothers?Meat\nforms uric acid.\nIf you must have your meat every day,\nmt it, but flush your kidneys with salts\neeaaionally, says a noted authority who\ntells us that meat forms urio acid which\nalmost paralyzes the kidneys in their efforts\nto expel it from the blood.

Even with these large shipments\nthe allies have found it necessary\nto reduce consumption of all\nkinds of meats and put it to an average\nof about one and one-quarter pounds\nper week per person in order that no\nfurther draft may be made upon ship\nping that is now required Tor the\ntransport of our soldiers.\n"Our consumption of meats Is about\nthree and one-quarter pounds per\nweek per person, and if we are to\nmake both ends balance during the\nshort marketing season, we must have\nfurther economy.\n"If the public will continue rigorous\nelimination of waste and will further\neconomize by reducing the quan*\ntlty prepared for each meal of all\ndnds of meats and poultry, more particularly\nbeef, and will restrict thelx\npurchases accordingly, the Food Administration\nhopes that the necessary\nralance can be maintained. A general\nidherence to these recommendations\nprill avoid the inconvenience which\nirises in many directions from meatess\ndays and will cause less interference\nin the daily preparation of food."\nWHEAT SITUATION\nSERIOUS PROBLEM\n*eople Asked to Give Up Eating\nWheat Bread Until After\nNext Harvest\nColumbia.?The wheat situation is\n;he most serious in the food Bupply\n)f the Allied world.\nThis word comes from Washington\na the Food Administration at Columbia.\nThe statement continues:\n"Our harvest\' was less than estimated;\nneeds of the Allies are greater\nthan were calculated; losses by sea\nind by battle have been heavier than\nnrere anticipated; less comes from the\nArgentine than had been hoped; tens3r\ndemands on shipping space restrict\n-VI ? rtinii Qvor in tho nhnrtARt\nsuiyo XIXUl O bUUU VIV1 vvr vuw WMW. ??v.\ntiaul and the tightest bulk."\nUntil the next harvest the crisis will\nnot have been passed. The call Is\ntherefore Issued that all who can and\nill who will go without wheat?give\nup wheat bread entirely?until the\nnext harvest, as the club women of\nSouth Carolina have pledged themselves\nto do; that those who do not go\non an entirely wheatlees ration cut\ndown the consumption of wheat by at\nleast one-half, and that households\nkeep within a weekly allowance for\neach person of one And one-half\npounds of flour and all other wheat\nproducts.\n:?

The-grocers are being supplied\nwith these certificates by the county\nfood administrators, who are In turn\nsupplied by the State administrator.\nThe certificate system is used to\nmake sure that heme canners may obtain\nsufficient sugar to preserve perishable\nfruits and at the same time to\nplace a check upon those who would\nendeavor to obtain unreasonable quantities\nfor household consumption:\nTHE IRISH POTATO\nBECOMES WAR RATION\ntl- ?a?? flof o nnfo f/ >\nU01UI1I Uia.?

Potatoes have\nkept the people of Germany alive.\nProbably Germany would have caved\nin except for the potato.\nThe argument is put forth by the\nFood Administration that if the potato\nwill work for Germany, It will\nlikewise work against Germany; aad\nconsidering that food will win the war,\nthere is n oarticle of food that may\nbe prepared In so many ways as the\npotato.\ni l \' Y. r! \\ .\nI\nI\nALWAY\nT~~\n/\nGood ]\nbusines\ndo--pri\nyour b\nyou wl\nPrinting \\\nany more\nI\nI Now is th<\nI Printin\nI THE]\nPrinting\nunaer a new pian, just auuuuuked\nby Herbert Hoover, of handling\nthe nation\'s food affairs through\nzone offices, Atlanta will probably\npecome the central point for the\nStates of Georgia, North and South\nCarolina, Florida and Alabama.\nWWWWWWWW\nV V\nV COLD SPRING NEWS.
