next\nweek thero Is a little matter connect\ned with his own department upon\nwhich an explanation Is duo to tho\npublic It refers to the suit Treasurer\nKepolkai has been compelled to bring\nIn order to secure payment for legal\neervlces which ho engaged in tho por\nformance of hla duties as a public offi\ncial\nMr Kepolkai Is himself a lawyer\nprobably equajly as learned ns Attor\nney General Andrews and many peo\nplo think more so Being of tho samo\nopinion as tho formor Superintendent\nof Public Works Henry E Cooper tho\nTreasurer endeavored to save to tho\nTerritory certain properties which In\nhis judgment might Illegally pass into\ntho hands of tho pountlcB Upon sev\neral occasions ho endeavored to seo\ntho Attorney Genoral at tho latters of\nfice but Mr Andrews was always ab\nsent Timo being urgent tho Troasur\ncr sought advlco elsewhere outsido of\ntho ofllcial family agreeing to pay a\ndown town firm of lawyerp for their\ncounsel and action In rescuing Territo\nrial proporty from tho hands of othors\nA bill for this professional service\nwas held up by Auditor Fisher upon\ntho advlco of tho Attorney Genoral\nacting in concert with tho lest of the\nJHyl i\nBjmywr\nup Btalrs branch of tho oHlclal family\nIt cannot be claimed on tho part of tho\nsix of theso months and whllo Mr An\ndrows was Attorney General no less\nthan 4500 havo been paid to attor\nneys outslda of his office\nYet tho Treasurers claim for 250\nwas ruled out It Is In order for Mr\nAndrews to explain what If any other\nsuch legal bills have been disapproved\nby him It Is also In order for Mr\nAndrewp to explain whether or not ho\nhas say within tho last forty days\nBinco January 1 engaged any other\nlegal talent to aid in tho performances\nof his official duties for which tho\nbills havo not yet been rendered or\npaid\nMr Andrews has told his friends of\nhis proposed departuro for Washington\nnext week Wo think ho had better re\nmain here It Is said that ho is wanted\nas a witness in tho Georgo Davis dis\nbarment case His presenco would al\nso be desirable in tho caso of Kepolkai\nvs FlBher In which ho should bo put\nupon tho witness stand that tho public\nmay know tho ins and outs of tho Ke\npolkai matter Tho Attorney General\nmay howover prefer to eat crow let\nthe 250 bill bo paid and maintain an\nundignified Bllenco ub to Its holdup\nwhllo 4500 havo been paid in similar\ncases within the six months and with\nout question\nThe No Fnsion Proposition\nSince charging Charles Wilcox with\nfathering that Homo Rule no fusion\nresolution our informant has dropped\nIn to tell us that ho unthinkingly put\nus on the wrong track and that ho felt\na great wrong had been dono Mr Wil\ncox Ho said that that resolution was\nfathered by that other Homo Rule\nCharley surnamed Notloy tho most\nrancorous and would bo dictator of\nthem all in that narrow minded body\nof politicians Such being tho case wo\nmake hasto to oxculpato Mr Wilcox\nfrom tho stigma wo unintentionally\nplacodtupon him and withdraw what\never wo havo said against him of our\nown volition without bolng thereto re\nquested No harm was intended other\nthan to show their hands and slnco\nthey are known wo nro content to lot\nthem feel that wo knew of what thoy\nhad and were and aro bMU doing\nThat no fuslon resolution which\nCbas Notloy Introduced a fortnight\nago in tho

carefully planned\nor at least tho part of it that has al\nready been carried out and tho move\nments of tho divisions aro llko clock\nwork It is now absolutely certain\nthat Japan intends to completely en\nvelope Korea Vast armies will be\nstationed at tho different vantage\npoints between Fusan on tho South\nand tho lino of Manchuria on tho\nNorth and they will be equipped to\nmovo rapidly Should Russia not\nmarch Into Korea tho first great bat\ntlo will doubtless be forced by Japan\nby an effort to lnvado Manchuria and\nwill doubtless tako place beyond but\nnear the Korean line\nRussia has certainly mado a bad\nshowing In tho first encounter at saa\nIn fact if the cable reports are to be\nrelied upon it looks as though a mis\nerable failure had been mado in sea\nmanship by the Russians for they not\nonly had Port Arthur behind them\nbut wero contending against a fleet\nthat was not so far as is known es\nsentially superior\nTOPICS OF THE DAY\nCol C P Iaukea aided by
