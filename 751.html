C„ to learn\nwhether the Swing-Johnson bill\ncan be so amended as to be\nsatisfactory to the state of Utah.\nSaid committee shall report back\nto the governor of the state of\nUtah, and if the said Swing-John\nson bill cannot be satisfactorily\namended, then your committee\nrespectfully recommends to the\ngovernor and the legislature of\nthe state of Utah the immediate\nrepeal! of the enactment of the\nstate of Utah giving is adherence\nto the Colorado river compact.”\nGovernor Frank C. Emerson,\nof Wyoming, who was the Wyom\ning commissioner at the Santa\nFe conifenance, said that in his\nopinion Utah will be acting “a\nbit hasty”, if it passes the bill\nto annul Utah’s ratification of\nthe six-state compact.\n■\'Likely it is the idea of the\nsenator and Governor Dern to\nJstand by the seven-state compact,”\nsaid Governor Emerson, "but\nclauses of the Swing-Johnson\nbill, which is now before con\ngress, covering Che six-state agree\nment, apparently give us ample\n| protection.\nOUTLOOK BRIGHT\nPROJECT MEASURE\nHouse Rules Committee\nChairman Says Boulder\nBill Will Pass At This\nSession of Congress\nWASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 11.\n—Advocates of the Swing-Johnson\nBoulder dam bill are in high\nspirits today, since the announce\nment was made at the White\nHouse by Chairman Snel of the\nhouse legislative program and\nBoulder dam bill is going on the\nhouse legiislaitive program and\nwill be passed by the house\nthis session.\nThis assurance from the chair\nman of the rules committee, ten\ndays in advance of the meeting\nof his committee to consider the\nrequest for a rule for the Boulder 1\ndam bill, is accepted by the bill\nadvocates as positive assurance\nthat their measure is to be call\ned up in the house not long\nafter January 20, when the rules\ncommittee is to meet. They claim\nan overwhelming mUjority for\nthe bill in house and senate.\nThe Boulder dam advocates\nare still more jubilant because\nChairman Snell made his state\nment after talking with the presi\ndent this morning on the house\nlegislative program and outlook.\nTomorrow the California dele\ngation is to call on the president\nin a body and ask him to lend\nihi\'s aid in getting the Swing\nJohnson bill through congress be\ntween now and March 4, and the\nfact that Chairman Snell should\npublicity declare his purpose to\nbring up this bill after having\ntalked over the whole program\nwith Mr. Coolidge is construed\n| as indicating that the program\nof the house leaders meets with\n; executive approval.\n! Had the president not been in\naccord with the idea of giving\nthe Boulder dam bill early con\nsideration in the house, it is ar\ngued that M\'r. Snell would sc3rce\nj ly have made the* public an\nnouncement he did.\nBIG CROWD ARRIVES\n! FOR TRAP SHOOTING\nMORE ARE COMING\nBig Ball Tonight.

Balzar, of\nNevada, declined to comment on\nthe bill introduced in the Utah\nstate senate annulling Utah’s\nratfication of the six-state Colo\nrado river compact. The gover\nnor expressed surprise that such\na bill should be introduced and\nsaid he would withhold comment\nuntil he had received a report\nfrom True Vencill, his personal\nrepresentative.\nApprised of the bill introduced\nin the Utah senate yesterday an\nnulling Utah\'s ratification of the\n6ix-state compact, Governor Hunt\ntoday said only that the Arizona\nadministration “has always been\nopposed to the six-state pact,\nof course and favorable action\nby the Utah legislature on this\n| measure would seem to me to be\nan idication that Utah was being\n[won over tothe side of Arizona\njin the Colorado river contro\nversy.’’\nArizona was not a party to the\njsix-state pact, and the Arizona\nlegislature twice has nafused to\nratify the seven-state pact drawn\nup at Santa Fe, N. M„ in 1922.\n|The necessity of passing Colora\ndo river legislation for the protec\ntion of Arizona’s rights in the\nstream furnished the keynote\nof the governor’s message vo the\nregular session of the legislature.\nGov.

T.

Had" the petitioners, end\ned their petition right there the\nsolution of the problem would\nhave been simple and easy to\nsolve.\nThey rnserted a clause, or para\ngraph. requesting protection from\nfire which placed the petition in\na different light.\nThe Hon.

I gave\nthe time> and felt, and really\n"know that I was throwing the\ntime away and was also ill ai\nthe time as I have been foi\nmonths since.\nI make special mention of the\nabove two paragraphs to clearly\ndemonstrate that so called old\ntown (original townsite of La<\nVegas) could not look for 01\nreceive any help whatever from\nthe Las Vegas Land & Watei\nCo., in the way of an adequate\nwater supply.\nGentlemen I will digress a mom\nent and state that during 1891\nand immediately thereafter I had\ncome at my own expense to look\nover the possibilities for a future\nmyself in what hag since become\nClark county. Another real-honest\nto-goodness surveyor had inform\ned me of the real opportunities\nHe is buried in Dedamar, Nev\n1 took my chances and am not\nat all sorry for it.\nNow to our problem of water\nwork for old town. I solicited\nprices of land in the proven ar\ntesian belt of Las Vegas valley\nwhich would furnish an adequate\nsupply and while doing so dis\ncovered or confirmed former\nimpression, that the territory lay\ning to the northwest of our city\nof today would furnish all of our\ncity of today and one several\ntimes as large, with both domestic\nwater for house use and also\nfull fire protection for our homes\nToday I had three members of\nour city council to view this\nnorthwestern part of our city and\nall on land within our city bound\nary limits.

In a nutshell, was the\nfamous "Thirty Years’ war.” Like\nmost horrors of its sort and time, it\nhud Its origin in religious disputes.\nIt endured from IBIS to 1648.\nThe war had its beginning be\ntween the Protestant states of\nnorthern Germany and Austria.\nWithin a few years it had extend\ned until it included, on one side,\nAustria, Spain, south Germany and\nFrance, and the Protestant coun\ntries of Europe on the other. In\n1618 Bohemia threw off Imperial\nauthority The North German states\nhad fornred a union, and this union\ntook Bohemia\'s part. Together\nthey drove the imperial troops from\nBohemia and invaded Austria up to\nthe very gates of Vienna. There\nfamine and bad weather forced\nthem to halt and turn back.\nme King or nonemia necanie em\nperor of Germany under the title\nof Ferdinand II. The Bohemians\nhated him and asked the Elector\nFrederick V to rule them. Fred\nerick was already head of the Union\nand was son-in-law of Janies I of\nEngland. Ferdinand made short\nwork of his pretensions, for he ut\nterly routed him at YVissemberg,\nNovember 8, 1(!20, and at the same\ntime crushed out I’rotestantism in\nBohemia.\nBut the Union quickly recovered.\nYY\'ith money donated by England,\nan army from Holland, and with\nKing Christian IV of Denmark for\nally, they again took the field. But\nthe Imperial general, YY’allenstein,\nbeat them at I lessau, in 1626; ,\nwhile his associate. General Tilly,\novercame King Christian and drove\nhim back to his own territory. YVal- !\nlenstein continued his conquests,\nannexing the land of Denmark’s j\nMecklenburg allies, and sweeping\non to the Baltic. There the coast\ntowns held out bravely against him,\nand he was superseded by Tilly.\nThe latter besieged Magdeburg,\ncapital of Saxony, and, after seven\nmonths\' fighting, took It. The most\nhorrible butchery followed the cap\nture of the city.\nGustavus Adolphus, king of\nSweden, had won for himself the\ntitle “The Lion of the North.” He\nhad raised Sweden to a world pow\ner and had revolutionized her war\nfare. He had successfully invad\ned Denmark. Poland and Russia,\nand his name was a terror to\nSweden’s foes. Now he cast In his\nlot wit{i the Union; and, with the\navowed purpose of protecting\nProtestantism in Germany, landed\na Swedish army on the Pomeranian\ncoast. June 24, 1630. He was not\nwholly disinterested in this inva\nsion. He also desired to Impede\nAustria\'s growing power and to es\ntablish Swedish territory on the\nBaltic coast In his plan to check\nAustria he was secretly aided by\nFrance.\nNo sooner had Gustavus Adolph\nus landed than he begun to make\nhis dominant presence felt. He\ndefeated Tilly, near Leipsic, and,\neverywhere victorious, advanced on\nthe lower palatinate and the Rhine\ntowns. Tilly again opposed him in\n1632, near the River Lech. "The\nLion of the North” defeated and\nkilled him and advanced on Mu\nnich. YVallenstein, with a mighty\narmy, confronted him near Nurern\nburg and succeeded in repulsing\nhim. Gustavus retired into Saxony.\nYVallenstein followed him. The\narmies met at Lutzen, November\n6, 1632, in a great battle. The\nSwedes won a decisive victory, but\nat fearful cost, for the gallant Gus\ntavus Adolphus was killed.\nYet the death of this empire\nchanging general and king had the\neffect of maddening, instead of dis\nheartening, his troops.\' Hot for\nvengeance, the Swedes swept on\nward, rivaling the Austrians them- J\nselves in barbarity. They laid\nwaste to all Bavaria. YVallenstein\nwas assassinated, but the emperor\nsent an army against the Swedes,\nbeating them at Nordlingen, Sep\ntember 6, 1634. After this setback,\nthe German Union was quite ready\nfor peace; but .the Swedes would\nnot hear of such a thing. They\nfelt their slain king was not yet\navenged. They devastated Saxony\nand Thuringia, defeated a German\narmy at Breltenfeld, then thrashed\nChristian of Denmark, who hud j\ngone over to the emperor’s side.\nThey followed up their successes\nby winning victories over two more\nImperial armies.\nFrance and England had by this\ntime been drawn Into the war as j\nSweden’s allies, and Saxony and :\nBavaria were once more success- 1\nfully invaded. The allies swept all j\nbefore them. Ferdinund II was dead j\nand his successor was only too !\neager to make terms of peace with\nthe all-conquering invaders.\nSo, in 1648, ended the Thirty\nYears’ war, and the sorely dis\ntressed German states rested, ex\nhausted and impoverished, from\ntheir long struggle. The plain peo\nple were chief sufferers. LItera- j\nture, art, industry—civilization it\nself—were set back throughout all\nGermany. Barbarism, heavy taxes, :\nstoppage of every refining and high\ner influence, devastation of entire j\nprovinces and wholesale slaughter\nof helpless noncombatants had been\nthe chief features of the struggle.\nEnos Tuttle expected to go to\nthe hospital next week to have\nhis tonsils removed, but since\nhe drank a pint of Christmas\'\ngin the doctors can’t find’em. j\nBUICK ELIMINATES\n, BODY VIBRATION\n—\nAll causes of engine vibration. I\nnoise and closed body rumble i\nhave been eliminated In the\nBuicks for 19*7, according to the\nBuick engineering department\nThese improvements rre no rad\nical changes from the fundamen\nts\' design of the present Buick\nengine, but rather are built around\nthe features which have enjoyed\nsuccess for year8 past. Buick\nclaims to have obtained these re\nsults by a series of important\nimprovements.\nChief among them is a comof\nnation of a counter - balanced\ncrankshaft and torsion balancer,\nwhich is something entirely new\nand advanced in crankshaft de\nsign and in an exclusive Buick\nfeature.\nCounterweights keep the crank\nshafts from deflecting by properly\ncounter-balancing the crank pins\nand lower ends of the connect\ning rods. They keep the shaft ;\nin line at all speeds, aliminate j\nhigh main bearing pressure,\nwhich are the chief causes of\'\nengine rumble, noise* and rough !\nrunning.\nA torsion balancer absorb^ the\ntendency of tha crankshaft to\ntwist under the power impulses\nand delivers these impulses back\nto the crankshaft after the piston\nforces have bean spent. In this\nmanner any period vibration is\nironed out and the engine has an\neven , smooth flow of power 1\nthroughout the speed range.\nExhaustive tests at the Gen\neral Motors proving grounds in i\ncompetition with other cars show\nthe Buick method to be the sim\nplest and most practical, and by\nfar the most effective means of\nled iui fruiting -<torsional vibration,\nit is claimed.\nAdditional aids to smooth and |\nquiet performnce in the new !\n1!)27 Btticks are light, cast iron\npistons, a heavy flywheel, giant j\ntransmission gears, quiet valve j\nmechanism, rubber engine mount-1\nings at all three points of sus- i\npensions, quiet exhaust system,\nand new transmission gear teeth\nto reduce hum.\nAll of these refinements, from\nthe balanced engine to the muf\nfler tail pipe, bring about the\nsmoothness and quietness of the\nnew Buick.\nCAL.

Old Coldfield\nCompany Has Large In\nterests.\nGOLDFIELD, Nev.—The Reor\nganized Booth holds a unique\nposition in the annals ot min\ning organizations. So far as we\nknow it is the only mine in the\nworld that has paid its stock\nholders $500,000 in dividends and\nyet never produced a pound ot\nore. The company was formed\nin the early days in Goldfield\nbut was not successful as a min\ning venture A vigorous campaign\nof development work failed to\nproduce ore. The United States\nrecognized the apex rights of\nmine owners as to the source of\nan ore deposit. If you can prove\nthat a vein containing the ore\napexes on your ground, you can\nfollow it, no matter if it takes\nyou into the adjoining properties,\nand if these adjoining properties\ntake out the ore they must pay\nyou for it. In 1914 the Reor-j\nganized Booth had just such a1\ncontroversy with the Jumbo Ex\ntension company. Apex proceed\nings were started but the matter\nwas eventually settled out of\ncourt and the money derived\nfrom these proceedings consti\ntuted the dividends menloned.\nSince then the Reorganized\nBooth has been a holding company\nIt owns tjhe controlling stock in- j\nterest of the Boundary Red Moun\ntain Mining company, with pro- j\nperties located 25 miles from the,\ninternational boundary line of\nBritish Columbia in the state of\nWashington. The Boundary Red 1\nMountain is developed by a tun-!\nBel whlfch strike under the |\nmountain at a level that gives\na depth of 500 feet. At this i\ndepth a body of gold ore was;\nfound carrying values of $25 a\nton. This gold ore is milled on\nthe grounds of the company with\na 25-stamp mill\nIt is natural hypothesis that |\nif a good vigorous vein or ore i\ncarrying $25 is found on the\n500 level, that at greater depth\na bigger body of ore will be\nfound carrying greater values.\nWith this idea in view, the Bound\nary Rad Mountain has driven\na tunnel that cuts the mountain\nat 1200 feet depth, but to date\nthey have' not opened the ore on\nthis level. This, however, does\nnot mean that the ore will not\nhe found. Veins have a great\nway of flattening out or being j\ncut by faults in such a manner i\nthat they slide to one side or\nthe other,or up and down, as\nthe case may be. Something of\nthis kind has happened in the\n700 feet of ground that lies be\ntween the two tunnels of the\nBoundary Red Mountain. Sooner\nor later the ore will he found\nand it is the belief of the manage\nment that when it is found it\nwill prove bigger and richer than\never. !\nIn addition to their Boundary\nRed Mountain interest, the Re\norganized Booth holds interests\nin Quartz mountain. They have\na large stock interest in the San\nRafael, the Calico, the San Felipe\nand the Exchequer companies.\nThe Reorganized Booth shares\nwere selling at a few cents when |\nthe company first went into\nQuartz mountain. From this price\nthey rapidly mounted until they\nreaced a maximum of around 80\ncents. They have since reacted\nand are selling at present In the\nthirties.\nAPPOINTS JUDGE TO SIT\nWITH SUPREME COURT\nGovernor Balzar yesterday re\nquested Wm. E.

The board\nitself is the important thing and\nwe see no reason why the state\nshould wait for two years for it.\nThe members could be appointed\nfor two years this year and elect\ned in 1928 if desired. Let us\nhave a board in 1927 composed\nof business men who will criti- i\ncally investigate the financial j\nsituation confronting the schools j\nand so be prepared for wise ac\ntion in 1929.”\nThe present ten judicial dis\ntricts in Nevada be reduced to\nsix in the interest of economy\nwithout impairment of efficiency.\nThat the legislaturde consider\ncarefully the proposed amend\nment which would repeal the\npresent constitutional limit of\ntwo mills, or twenty cents in the\nstate tax rate for education\npurposes.\nThat the legislature consider\nby counties, cities and special\ndistricts a “serial bond” plan be\nadopted.\nNEVADA LAWYER NEARS\nEND OF PRISON TERM\nVictor E.

The survey was\nmade in order to determine as\ncharacter of the various soil\ntypes with a view to assisting lo\ncal farmers to adapt their crops to\nthe soils to the best advantage.\nThe report, whioh contains 45\npages of text and a large color\ned soil map, describes in detail\nthe numerous types of soil and\nindicates th3ir extent and dis\ntribution. Thera is also a dis\ncussion of the topography and\ndrainage, roads and other trans\nportation facilities, markets, cli\nmate and agriculture of the area.\n: The agriculture of the region\nconsists mainly in growing al\nfalfa, fruits and vegetables. A\nconsiderable surplus of peaches,\napricots and grapes is produced.\njCherries, apples, figs and plums\nare grown for home use and mar\nket. The quantity of vegeta\nbles produced is insufficient for\nlocal needs. Dairy cattle are\nkept on a number of ranches in\nthe area. All surplus alfalfa hay\nis required for local demands.\nThe feeding of all surplus hay\nto dairy or beef stock rather\nthan marketing it from the ranch\nwould doubtless prove more prof\nitable.\nThe farms in most cases are\noperated by the owners. No\nattempt is made to rotate crops.\nThe winters are mild and the\nsummers are characterized by\nhot days and cool nights. The\ngrowing season averages 222\n! days in length.\nThe report is of interest to\nlocal farmers and others partic\nularly concerned with agricul\nture of the area.

Herald\nprints the following clipping taken\nfrom an old Boston newspaper\npublished in 1866:\n"A man about 46 years of age,\ngiving the name of Joshua\njCoopersmith, hm* been arrested in\n| New York for* attempting to ex\ntort funds from ignorant and\neuperstiuus people by exhibit\ning a device which he says will\nconvey the human voice any dis\ntance over metallic wires so that\n!it may be heard by the listener\nat the other end. He calls the\nj instrument a “telephone” which\niis obviciously intended to imi\nItate the word “telegraph” and\njwin confidence of those who\nknow of the success of the latter\nj instrument without understand\ning the principal on which it is\nbased. Well-informed people\n>know that it is impossible to\ntransmit the human voice over\nwires as may be done with dots\nand dashes and signals of the\nMorse code, and that, were it\npossible to do, the thing would\nbe of no practical value. The\nauthorities who apprehended this\ncriminal are to be congratulated,\nand it i8 to be hoped that his\npunishment will be prompt and\nfitting, that it may serve as an\nexample to other conscienceless\nschemers who enrich themselves\nat the expense of their fellow\ncreatures.”\nNOTICE FOR PUBLICATION\nSerial No. 013034\nDepartment of the Interior\nU.

So\nyou city dads get busy and raise\nand place in First State Bank\nthe sum of $6200 for a clear title\nto what you viewed today and\n[ will add to that, that every\ntown lot and every acre I own in\nClark county will guarantee to\nthe city of Las Vegas a real\nsource of supply of water for do\nmestic and fire protection.\nNote: That I have but ten days\ntime on one tract and 25 days\ntime on other tract to pay full\npurchase price.\nGentlemen, -Los Angeles was\nwae built from a city of 70,000\na3 I first saw it to what it is\ntoday by real thoughtful action.\nThere were critics by the hund\nreds and Los Angeles went ahead\nand did not even bother with\nbrushing the critics out of the\nway.\nLet us prepare for the upbuild\ning of our community.
