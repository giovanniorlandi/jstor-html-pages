The model expands on earlier efforts\nto understand intent to use weapons of mass destruction by building upon well-researched\ntheories of intent and behavior and focusing on a sub-set of weapons of mass destruction\n(WMD) to account for the distinct challenges of employing different types of WMD in\nviolent acts. The conceptual model is presented as a first, critical step in developing a\ncomputational model for assessing the potential for groups to use chemical or biological\nweapons.\nThis article is available in Journal of Strategic Security: http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/\nvol10/iss3/4\n', '54 \nIntroduction \nProliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), most \ncommonly defined as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear \n(CBRN) devices are grave threats to United States (US) national security.1 \nAlthough several domestic and international terrorists and terrorist \ngroups have communicated their intent to acquire and use WMD \nincluding nuclear weapons, explosives have been the weapon of choice.2 \nAn ongoing concern is identifying indicators that an existing or emerging \nterrorist group intends to expand its arsenal to include CBRN weapons. \n \nThe apparent preference for conventional weapons (explosives) by violent \ngroups is understandable. Explosives are a proven technology with known \noutcomes, generally require only basic knowledge of chemistry and \nrelatively easy-to-obtain materials and instructions to manufacture, and \ncan be acquired through criminal and other networks. They have the \nadditional benefit of creating a significant visual and psychological impact \nbeyond damage or destruction of their target. In contrast, WMD are more \ndifficult to manufacture, acquire, and use, and their outcomes are less \ncertain.3 However, opportunities may arise that significantly reduce the \n                                                     \n1 Although explosives have been included in some definitions of WMD, for example, \nthe definition used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation which includes any \nexplosive or incendiary (bomb, grenade, rocket having an explosive or incendiary \ncharge of more than four ounces, missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of \nmore than one-quarter ounce, mine of device similar to any of the devices described), \nthey are considered conventional weapons not requiring the same type of prohibitions \nas CBRN for use in state-on-state armed conflicts.

For example, roadside bombs used \nagainst US forces in Iraq in 2003 contained Iraqi-produced chemical \nweapons abandoned after the Iran-Iraq war two decades earlier.4 \n \nThe challenges WMD pose for non-state actors suggest that factors \ndifferent from those associated with conventional weapons are likely to \naffect consideration of WMD as part of a terrorist group’s strategy. As \nadvances in science and technology further reduce obstacles to successful \nexecution of a WMD attack, it is increasingly important to understand why \na group would commit to acquisition or production and use of WMD and \nwhat indicators would signal movement toward such a commitment. \n \nChemical and biological weapons are sufficiently different from \nradiological and nuclear weapons to warrant separate analysis. For \nexample, compared with radiological and nuclear devices or weapons, \nchemical and biological agents and weapons are easier to conceal, the \nmaterials needed to produce them are relatively easier to acquire, and a \nchemical or biological weapons (CBW) program requires less financing \nand expertise to establish.5 The knowledge required to perform biological \nand chemical science also shares more in common than that required for \nradiological and nuclear science, which may have implications for \nrecruitment and efficient application of expertise. Like radiological or \nnuclear weapons, even low concentrations of CBW can create panic and \nfear.6 However, because discovery of a chemical, biological, or radiological \nattack may not occur immediately, heightened panic and fear about the \nspread of the agent or material can ensue.7 Previous analyses of attempts \nto acquire or use CBW–while useful–have not resulted in a practical \nframework to identify indicators that a group may present a high risk for \n                                                     \n4 Eric Schmitt, “ISIS Used Chemical Arms at Least 52 Times in Syria and Iraq, Report \nSays,” New York Times, November 21, 2016, accessed January 24, 2017. \n5 NATIBO, “Biological Detection System Technologies Technology and Industrial Base \nStudy: A Primer on Biological Detection Technologies,” in Book Biological Detection \nSystem Technologies Technology and Industrial Base Study: A Primer on Biological \nDetection Technologies, (City: North American Technology and Industrial Base \nOrganization, 2001); Andrea A.

As early as \n1000 BC, the Chinese used arsenic smoke against enemies. Both World \nWars saw experimentation and use of chemical and biological weapons \n(for example, WWI: Germany’s use of anthrax to infect Russian horses, \nchlorine and mustard gas use by Germany early in the war and by Britain \nlate in the war; WWII: Japan’s experimentation with and use of cholera \nand other biological agents against Chinese cities).9 \n \nWith few exceptions, CBW also are generally not the sole weapon \nconsidered by a group. Aum Shinrikyo, an apocalyptic religious sect that \nreleased sarin gas in the Tokyo subway in 1995, tried unsuccessfully to \nacquire and manufacture nuclear weapons and researched other weapon \ntechnologies such as lasers and microwaves while running chemical and \nbiological weapons programs.10 The arsenals of armed militia groups in \nthe United States have included both conventional weapons (for example, \nassault rifles and bombs) and CBW (ricin by the Minnesota Patriots \nCouncil; potassium cyanide by The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of \nthe Lord).11 Attacks perpetrated by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham \n                                                     \n8 Jerrold M.

They have been used for both political \nand criminal purposes.  For example, ISIS used CW to slow down and \ndemoralize Iraqi forces advancing on Mosul, the Rajneeshees \ncontaminated food at several restaurants to affect the outcome of a local \nelection, VX agent was used to murder Kim Jong-Nam, a disgruntled \nemployee poisoned the food of his co-workers, and ricin was used to \nmurder a Bulgarian and in an attempt by an individual to poison a spouse \nin a child custody battle.13 \n \nAlthough individuals have perpetrated many of the documented attacks \nusing chemical or biological (CB) agents, groups are the focus of the \nmodel. So-called lone wolf attacks are more likely to have a criminal \npurpose such as extortion or revenge and be one-time events.14  Groups are \nmore likely to have access to the resources needed to develop an organic \nCB capability. Because groups have at least two members, there are also \nmore opportunities to observe indicators or trip wires such as expertise of \ngroup members, intercept communications, or infiltrate the group.15  \n                                                     \n(1985),” in Toxic Terror: Assessing Terrorist Use of Chemical and Biological \nWeapons, ed.

For example, \ncharismatic leadership is often a valued characteristic in non-terrorist \ngroups and organizations. Additionally, personal attributes, such as \ncharismatic leadership or paranoia and grandiosity, are difficult to identify \ncorrectly without specialized training, a broad range of data from extended \nobservations or measurement, or both.17 Moreover, individuals may \nexpress the same attribute in several ways. Paranoid individuals, for \nexample, can be stubborn and argumentative or aloof and withdrawn.  An \norganizing framework should improve identification of intent to acquire \nand use CBW. \n \n                                                     \n16 Reviews include a 1994 study of incidents of CBW terrorism in 26 countries since \nWorld War I (Harvey J.

Reviews of research on terrorism, \npolitical and criminal violence, the ideology and dynamics of terrorist \ngroups, radicalization, and group organizational processes that support \nterrorist operations provided a foundation for understanding the \nmotivations of individuals and groups, and the circumstances associated \nwith terrorism and with attempted and actual use of CBW.18 \nTwo theories from social and organizational psychology–the Theory of \nPlanned Behavior and Expectancy Theory–inform the model.19 These \ntheories hold that choice among behavioral alternatives–such as use of \nviolence and type of weapons–is influenced by beliefs related to available \nbehavioral alternatives and the expected consequences of attempting and \nexecuting the behaviors.20 \n                                                     \n18 Ackerman, More Bang for the Buck; McCormick, “Terrorist Decision Making,” 473507;\nPost, Ruby, and Shaw, “The Radical Group in Context”; Maya Beasley, \n“Terrorism as Social Movement Tactic Theory, Mobilization” in Protecting the \nHomeland from International and Domestic Terrorism Threats: Current MultiDisciplinary\nPerspectives on Root Causes, the Role of Ideology, and Programs for \nCounter-Radicalization and Disengagement, Multi-Disciplinary White Papers in \nSupport of Counter-Terrorism and Counter-WMD, eds.

Vroom, Work \nand Motivation (New York, NY: Wiley, 1964). \n20 The definition of rationality varies across different disciplines. The most common \ndefinition is from economics and arises from the Theory of Rational Choice which \nholds that individuals make choices that maximize utility without the constraints of \ntime or effort (Howard Rachlin, “Rational Thought and Rational Behavior: A Review \nof Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox,” Journal of the Experimental \nAnalysis of Behavior 79, no. 3 (2003): 409-12). Bounded rationality was proposed to \naccount for the frequent observation that humans often rely on heuristics to satisfice \nrather than maximize utility given constraints on time and effort (Herbert A. Simon, \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 10, No. 3\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol10/iss3/4\nDOI: http://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.10.3.1612\n', '60 \n \nIn the Theory of Planned Behavior intention is the immediate precursor of \nbehavior, and intention follows from “beliefs about [a] behavior’s likely \nconsequences (perceived outcomes), about normative expectations of \nimportant others (social/group norms), and about the presence of factors \nthat control behavioral performance (moderating factors).”21 In \nExpectancy Theory, behavior follows from the expectation of reward \nassociated with choices among alternatives.22 Intent to perform a specific \nbehavior is based on the expectancy (belief) that a level of effort will lead \nto the intended performance (perceived capability), the perceived \ninstrumentality of the performance to achieve a desired outcome \n(instrumental to the desired end), and the desirability of the outcome (end \nstate value). These principal components of the two theories are, in turn, \naffected by background factors such as overarching beliefs, values or goals, \nindividual characteristics such as intelligence, religion, experience, \nculture, knowledge, and external factors such as opportunity and \nresources.  \n \nThe CBW Intent Model builds upon the principal components and \nbackground factors that comprise the Theory of Planned Behavior and \nExpectancy. It proposes that the intent of non-state actors to use violence, \ncommit terrorist acts, and employ specific tactics and weapons is a choice \namong behavioral alternatives.22 The choice can have a rational basis—to \nachieve an objective—or can represent a means of self-expression.23 Once \n                                                     \n“Rational choice and the structure of environments,” Psychological Review 63 \n(1956): 129-138.) The use of rationality in the discussion here comes from \npsychological science which defines a rational decision as a deliberative or planned \nversus emotional one based on perceptions or beliefs versus “facts.” (Ajzen, “The \nTheory of Planned Behavior,” 179-211; see also Arie W. Kruglanski, “The Psychology \nor Terrorism: ‘Syndrome’ Versus ‘Tool’ Perspectives,” Paper presented at the NATO \nAdvanced Research Workshop on Social and Psychological Factors in the Genesis of \nTerrorism, Castelvecchio, Pascoli, Italy, September 14-18, 2005), and which \ncorresponds to the notion of bounded rationality. Both disciplines recognize that \ndecisions based on cognitive effort may not necessarily be, or appear, logical. \n21 Ajzen, “The Theory of Planned Behavior,” 438.  \n22 McCormick, “Terrorist Decision Making,”473-507. \n23 A similar distinction between terrorism as an emotional or a rational behavior was \ndiscussed by Arie W. Kruglanski in “The Psychology or Terrorism: ‘Syndrome’ Versus \n‘Tool’ Perspectives.” From a psychological analysis, terrorism can be viewed within a \nmedical (disease) model as a “syndrome” with internal causes—such as personality \ntraits that predispose an individual to become a terrorist—and external causes, such \nas disadvantaged status of one’s ethnic, religious or other group or political \noppression. It can also be viewed as a “tool,” one of several means by which to achieve \na goal. The model presented in this article deals primarily with rational decisions to \nuse violence and CB weapons to achieve objectives rather than the factors underlying \nviolence as a form of self-expression. There is evidence that the motivation of some \nal-Qaeda operatives to attack the United States and the West is based in Islamist \nideology, which directs adherents to wage jihad against takfir (nonbelievers and nonMuslim\ngovernments) (Erick Stakelbeck, The Terrorist Next Door: How the \nGovernment Is Deceiving You About the Islamist Threat (New York, NY: Regnery \nPublishing, 2011)).

While analysts may be less concerned about a previously nonviolent\ngroup moving toward violence, they need to distinguish groups \nmoving toward violence using CBW from groups opting for conventional \nweapons. \n \nFigure 1 shows the composite and individual factors or indicators in the \nmodel as they relate to individual, group, and organizational processes, \nand external influences on the decisions of a group to use violence and \nspecifically CB violence. It also shows the connection between model \nindicators and the Theory of Planned Behavior and Expectancy Theory.30 \nNone of the composite and individual indicators alone is likely to confirm \nCBW intent. However, observation over time of multiple indicators that \nare consistent with the components of the Theory of Planned Behavior or \nExpectancy Theory and the CBW Intent Model may signal increased risk \nfor a group to choose violent behavior to achieve its objectives and CBW as \nthe means. \n \n                                                     \n28 John Horgan, “Discussion Point: The End of Radicalization?”; Clark McCauley and \nSophia Moskalenko, “Understanding Political Radicalization: The Two-Pyramids \nModel,” American Psychologist 72, no.3 (2017): 205-216, available at: \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1037/amp0000062. \n29 Arie W.

Although each of these three indicators could be \nassociated with conventional and other unconventional weapons, only \nCBW-specific instantiations constitute relevant signals of an interest in \nCBW. \n \nThe following section describes the indicators associated with general \nviolence and CB violence and the behavioral, organizational, and political \nconstructs supporting each factor. Examples illustrate how the constructs \nhave been observed in or discussed regarding specific, violent groups. A \nsmall number of examples are about violent criminal organizations. There \nare commonalties across violent groups, whether terrorists, gangs, or \ncriminal groups and more is known about the intra-group dynamics of \ngangs and criminal groups than of terrorist groups. Recognized differences \ninclude the importance of ideology and political objectives to terrorist \ngroups and the financial motives attributed to most gangs and criminal \ngroups.33 \n \nGeneral Violence \nGroups that have decided to use CBW have already opted for violence as a \nmeans to achieve their goals. Hence, the indicators associated with a \ntendency to engage in violence are necessary, but not sufficient, \npreconditions for CB violence. It is important to acknowledge that prior \nacts of violence may not precede the use of CBW and the decision to use \nviolence may occur close in time with the choice of method, especially if \nserendipity favors a particular method. However, for large-scale attacks, \ncomplex operations, or difficult to acquire weapons or technologies, some \namount of planning, procuring, and testing prior to an attack would \nimprove the likelihood of success. These pre-attack activities may produce \nobservable signatures of intended violence and the type of violence likely \nto occur. The composite indicators related to general violence have been \nassociated with group and organizational characteristics, processes, and \nfunctioning in general, and with the operations of terrorist, criminal, or \n                                                     \n33 Scott Decker and David Pyrooz, “Gangs, Terrorism, and Radicalization,” Journal of \nStrategic Security 4, no. 4 (2011): 151, available at: \nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1145&context=jss. \nZalesny et al.: Conceptual Model to Use CBW\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2017\n', '65 \npolitical groups that have attempted to achieve their goals through \nviolence.  \n \nLeadership Influence: Leadership Influences Group toward Use of Violence \nThis composite indicator reflects the intentional efforts by influential \ngroup members to move the group toward violence. Leader characteristics, \ngoals, beliefs, and group interactions collectively reflect leadership \ninfluence on a group. A change in leadership or leadership style may signal \na change in the group’s direction or activities (for example, toward greater \nviolence). While it may not be possible to assess leadership influence in \nemerging groups for which little information exists, the model provides a \nframework for data collection. \n \nLeader’s Ability to Impact or Influence Group Members \nAttributes that comprise a leader’s cognitive abilities, personality, motives \nand values, problem-solving and social skills, and expertise can provide \ninsights into a leader’s potential influence on a group. Groups led by \nauthoritarian or totalitarian leaders are more vulnerable to radical action \nand violence through polarization and groupthink.34 Among larger \nterrorist groups (for example, al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Liberation \nTigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE]), strategic decisions are typically made by \ntop leaders and core members while operational decisions are generally \nmade by the leadership of the group’s individual cells.35 Strong, assertive, \nself-confident, and driven leaders who have the trust of the group can \nwield considerable influence over the group and its goals.36 \n \nEXAMPLES: Shoko Asahara, the leader of the Aum Shinrikyo \ngroup that perpetrated the 1995 sarin attack in the Tokyo subway, \nwas described as having a monopoly on decision making within the \ngroup.37  \n \nLeadership within the Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the \nLord restricted participation in decision making to core members.38 \n \n                                                     \n34 Post, Ruby, and Shaw, “The Radical Group in Context.”  \n35 Mayntz, “Organizational Forms of Terrorism: Hierarchy, Network, or a Type Sui \nGeneris?” \n36 Hermann, “Assessing leadership style,”178-212; David C.

Research suggests that the decision to pursue \nunconventional weapons requires patient leadership, willingness to accept \nrisk and failures, and a willingness to absorb the associated costs. \n \nEXAMPLE: Osama bin Laden was described as the North Star of \nglobal terrorism influencing both the terrorist organization he \nfounded and its affiliated groups. His anti-Western Wahhabist \nideology shaped al Qaeda’s strategy to expel US forces from the \nArabian Peninsula.40 \n \nRisk/Benefit Assessment of Violence \nThe belief that the benefits of terrorism outweigh the risks may result from \nthe perceived instrumentality of terrorism to achieve group ends \ncompared with the instrumentality of other approaches or because of \nunmet psychological needs of group members.41 Indicators in this \ncomposite have been identified as key factors in radicalization toward \nviolence. They are also interrelated such that the same antecedent factor \nmay be present for multiple indicators. \n \nDissatisfaction with the Status Quo of Political Activism \nThis indicator represents the negative affect associated with the perceived \nineffectiveness of existing means of political activism. Violent conflict may \narise if one or more competing groups perceive they can change the status \nquo by fighting or do not believe non-violent means will achieve goals.42 \n \nEXAMPLE: The belief that the US government infringes on the \nfundamental rights of citizens and supports the creation of a world \ngovernment influenced the ideology and violent activities of the \n                                                     \n39 Locke and Latham, “New Directions in Goal-Setting Theory,” 265-8. \n40 Kate Zernike and Michael T.

Groups create and enforce norms for \nbehaviors that are important to the group and to maintain internal \ncohesion and the group’s relationships with other entities.63  Norms also \nhelp define expected and acceptable behaviors of group members. Cultural \nand religious norms in particular can facilitate effective group functioning \nas they define and reinforce acceptable behaviors for group members and \nexpress to others what the group believes.64  \n \n                                                     \n61 Mohammed Aly Sergie and Toni Johnson, “Boko Haram,” Council on Foreign \nRelations 7, no. 10 (2014): 2014, available at: http://www.cfr.org/nigeria/bokoharam/p25739.\n62 Holly Arrow, Joseph E.

Open groups have permeable boundaries and few \nconstraints on interactions with outsiders. Closed groups have generally \nimpermeable boundaries and little interaction with outsiders, and are \nsusceptible to groupthink.69 Relatively open groups that become highly \nrestrictive about group membership and outside interactions may signal \nincreased concern with secrecy concerning group operations. Physical or \nsocial isolation that insulates a group from societal norms and from notice \nby authorities can lead to reduced concerns about retribution or alienating \nsupporters.70 \n \n                                                     \n65 Emin Dashkin, “Justification of violence by terrorist organizations: Comparing ISIS \nand PKK,” Journal of Intelligence and Terrorism Studies 1 (2016), available at: \nhttps://doi.org/10.22261/PLV6PE (http://www.veruscript.com/a/PLV6PE/).  \n66 Hermann, “Assessing Leadership Style”; Syracuse, NY: Social Science Automation, \nInc.

Both types of shifts could signal a progression toward violence. \n \nDeliberations of groups that progress toward violence are difficult to \nobserve. Consequently, it is difficult to track changes from initial stating \nopinions or positions. However, several of the groups cited throughout this \ndocument appear to have operated under conditions conducive to \npolarization and choice shift.   \n \nEXAMPLE: Decision making in Aum Shinrikyo and the \nRajneeshees was completely under the control of the group’s \nauthoritarian leaders’ hierarchical decision-making structure.

They may also assume a specialized role that benefits all alliance \nmembers (for example, establishing an R&D program or experimenting \nwith new tactics and weapons such as CBW). \n \nEXAMPLE: When the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat \nallied with al Qaeda in 2006 (becoming al Qaeda in the Islamic \nMaghreb or AQIM), it adopted al Qaeda’s tactic of suicide \noperations and focused on the high profile targets al Qaeda \nattacked.91  \n \nRivalries \nRivalries may emerge because of conflicting beliefs, values, or tactics, or \ncompetition for influence over a population or area (for example, \ncompetition among the mujahidin groups in post-Soviet occupation \n                                                     \n86 Jacob Zenn, “A Biography of Boko Haram and the Bay’a to Al-Baghdadi,” CTC \nSentinel 8 (2015): 17-21, available at: https://ctc.usma.edu/posts/a-biography-ofboko-haram-and-the-baya-to-al-baghdadi.\n87 Defense Intelligence Agency, Human Factors Analysis Center. “Dynamic Group \nAssessment Methodology.” July 2009. \n88 Post, “Group and Organizational Dynamics of International Terrorism”; Post, \n“Differentiating the Threat of Chemical and Biological Terrorism,” 187.  \n89 Nicholas Blanford, Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah’s Thirty-Year Struggle \nagainst Israel (New York, NY: Random House, 2011). \n90 Letsch, “Turkey shuts 15 media outlets and arrests opposition editor.” \n91 Post, “Group and Organizational Dynamics of International Terrorism.” \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 10, No. 3\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol10/iss3/4\nDOI: http://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.10.3.1612\n', '76 \nAfghanistan).92 They may also contribute to radicalization of each groups’ \nmembers.93 Previously non-violent groups may engage in violence and \nviolent groups may explore new tactics or weapons to stand out from their \nrivals. \n \nEXAMPLE: ISIS propaganda has described rival Islamist groups or \nanti-ISIS groups such as Ahrar al-Sham and the al Qaida/Nusra \nFront as apostates and traitors linked to Iraqi Sunni tribal \nopposition to the Islamic State in Iraq.94 \n \nOrganizational Processes \nViolent groups and terrorist groups must perform tasks necessary for \ngroup maintenance, support, survival, and growth.95 In addition to \nattracting and recruiting members, groups must also socialize, train, and \nretain members, and organize to accomplish its objectives.96  For example, \nISIS has specialized functions to oversee finance, security, media, and \nrecruitment operations.97  \n \nStaffing and Maintaining the Organization \nIn addition to recruiting, groups must retain current members who \ncontribute operational expertise, training, capabilities, and understanding \nof norms and standard operating procedures. A shift in a group’s \nrecruitment, training, socialization, and operational tactics may indicate \nnew objectives and an increased risk of violence if the change is consistent \nwith support for violent activities.98 The rise in status of group members \ninvolved in violent attacks may communicate within and outside the group \nthat violence is acceptable and is a means to advancement in leadership \nranks. \n                                                     \n92 Sprinzak, “From Theory to Practice”; Post, “Group and Organizational Dynamics of \nInternational Terrorism.” \n93 McCauley and Moskalenko, “Mechanisms of Political Radicalization,” 415-33. \n94 Alberto M.

However, other evidence indicative of intent may be \navailable. Technical manuals related to chemical and biological agents, \nequipment to manufacture chemical or biological agents, or receipts for \nthe purchase of agents or equipment found at a group’s current or \nprevious location all reflect at least an interest in chemical or biological \nagents. The arrest of a group member in possession of such materials, a \ngroup’s association, partnership with suppliers or users of chemical- or \nbiological-related materials, or third-party observations or statements \nwould also constitute evidence of interest or intent. The CBW Intent \nModel proposes three indicators as indirect evidence of interest or intent \nto acquire or use CBW.  \n \nSocial Frames Support the Use of CB Weapons \nFraming refers to social influence on how individuals perceive or interpret \nand react to an object or event.119 Perception of the same event can vary \nconsiderably depending on the frame in which the event is set. For \nexample, a story about police arresting protesters framed by concerns for \n                                                     \n117 Based on a recently compiled dataset of incidents of failed and foiled (outside \nintervention) jihadist attempts since 1993 to attack the United States and its Western \nallies, Crenshaw (2016) observed that terrorists may sometimes perceive a failed or \nfoiled plot as being successful. Although data do not exist on whether failed or foiled \nattempts were treated by jihadist groups as intelligent failures and part of \norganizational learning, the compiled dataset may contain additional information on \nwhether and which groups have other characteristics of a learning organization. \nMartha Crenshaw, “Failed, Foiled, Completed, and Successful Jihadist Plots in the \nUnited States 1993-2016,” Telephonic presentation to the DHS/START/MINERVA \nand SMA Technical Lecture Series, Washington, D.C., May 31, 2016; Stephen Walsh \nand Paul Whitney, “A Graphical Approach to Diagnosing the Validity of the \nConditional Independence Assumptions of a Bayesian Network Given Data,” Journal \nof Computational and Graphical Statistics 21, no. 4 (2012): 961-78. \n118 Ibid, 90. \n119 Heidi A.

In the context of CBW, opportunity can be a found cache of \nchemical or biological weapons or a new group member with specialized \nskills, knowledge, or connections. \n \nA group can create near or longer-term opportunity by relocating closer to \nan area with a greater variety of resources to leverage. An extremist or \ncriminal group may also create and then capitalize on the failures of the \nstate to provide protection or services to the populace.129 According to the \nTheory of Planned Behavior, individuals or group members who assess \nthere are sufficient resources, opportunity, and few obstacles for pursuing \nspecific behaviors would be more likely to attempt the behaviors.130  \n \nOthers can create opportunity to stimulate interest in weapons or \ntechnology.

Nonetheless, ideology, values, and goals can \nprovide insights into whether a group presented with an opportunity to \nacquire or use CBW would take advantage of it.  \n \nA group’s ideology functions partly as an indicant of the group’s identity \n(“this is who we are”) and is important for group loyalty, cohesion, \nacceptance of group norms, and in the selection of potential allies or \npartners.136 Group members who are committed to the group’s ideology \nand values may also be more committed to accomplishing the group’s \ntasks even if it requires violence.137 Group leaders whose beliefs and values \n                                                     \n131 Helfstein Scott and John Solomon. “Risky Business: The Global Threat Network \nand the Politics of Contraband.” Combating Terrorism Center, May 2014, available \nat: https://www.ctc.usma.edu/v2/wpcontent/uploads/2014/05/RiskyBusiness_final.pdf.\n132 NATO, “Fighting Weapons of Terror,” in Book Fighting Weapons of Terror, \n[Electronic article] (Brussels: North Atlantic Treaty Organization, September 4, \n2015), available at: http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_122272.htm. \n133 Post, “Differentiating the Threat of Chemical and Biological Terrorism,”187; Bruce \nHoffman, Holy Terror: The Implications of Terrorism Motivated by a Religious \nPerspective (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 1993); Bruce Hoffman, Inside \nTerrorism (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 1998). \n134 Hoffman, Holy Terror. \n135 Victor Asal, Gary A.

However, groups may resist or reject outright \nweapons or tactics innovations that are not consistent with a group’s \nideology.138  \n \nBecause research has not sufficiently addressed the relationship between a \ngroup’s ideology and the use of CBW, this indicator is a topic for future \nresearch. Importantly, the level of analysis must distinguish among the \nideologies of specific groups. The question is not whether groups with \nreligious ideologies are more likely to use violence or CBW, but rather \nwhat about religious (or other) ideologies will influence a group’s actions. \n \nEXAMPLES: Aum Shinrikyo’s ideology included belief in an \napocalyptic war, which the cult would survive only by arming itself \nwith “powerful weapons including biological and chemical \nagents.”139  \n \nThe ideologies, values, and beliefs of groups such as al Qaeda, The \nCovenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, Hamas, and \nJemaah al Islamiyah support or are interpreted to support or \njustify the use of violence to defend against and defeat perceived \nenemies.140 \n \nApplication and Future Research \nThe conceptual model of CBW intent described in this article is the basis \nfor a computational CBW model which analysts can test and apply.141 The \ndevelopment and evaluation of the computational model is a critical next \nstep for our research program in CBW. Once in computational form, the \nconceptual CBW Intent Model can be empirically evaluated as a statistical \nmodel for the existence and strength of proposed relationships.142 With \n                                                     \n138 Ackerman, “More Bang for the Buck.”  \n139 David E.

Regens et al., \n“Probabilistic Graphical Modeling of Terrorism Threat Recognition Using Bayesian \nNetworks and Monte Carlo Simulation,” Journal of Cognitive Engineering and \nDecision Making 9, no. 4 (2015): 295-311; and Whitney, White, and Dalton (2014). \n142 Walsh and Whitney, “A Graphical Approach,” 961-78; Paul Whitney and Stephen \nWalsh, “Calibrating Bayesian Network Representations of Social-Behavioral Models” \nZalesny et al.: Conceptual Model to Use CBW\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2017\n', '85 \nsufficient data, interactions among the identified indicators can also be \nevaluated. Formal elicitation from experts leading to quantitative data is \nalso available to inform the computational model.143  \nTesting the application of the computational CBW model will use readily \navailable, processed data, such as those from the University of Maryland \nSTART Center, historical summaries, and news reporting on groups of \ninterest.144 Because parts of the conceptual model correspond with \nactivities that occur more frequently than the use of CBW (for example, \ngeneral political violence), it is expected that some parts of the model will \nbe more precisely calibrated than others.  Once the computational model \nis developed, it can be used for multiple purposes. First is to identify and \nprioritize indicators to monitor or track intent to use CBW in groups. \nSecond, the computational model can be used to quantify the status of \ntracked groups on each indicator to determine their risk for violent acts \nand use of CBW. Finally, the computational model can be used to track \nchanges in group status on all indicators to identify change in risk.  \n \nGiven the potentially large amount of information analysts review daily, it \nis impractical to expect anyone to apply the model as part of daily \ninformation review without additional assistance. To that end, the \ncomputational CBW model will be incorporated into a model-based \nanalysis software system to address both the scale of the data and the \ncomplexity of the model. As information related with CBW intent is \ncollected, the envisioned computational framework will support \ncomputational evaluations of the CBW model. Questions to address will \ninclude whether there are detectable regional variations in the expression \nof CBW intent, and how well the CBW Intent Model–developed \nconsidering non-state actors–captures state actors’ intent regarding use of \nviolence and CBW.
