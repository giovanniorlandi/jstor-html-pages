M., WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 20, 1902.\nVOL. 39\nNO. 154\nOF\nThree Desperadoes in Kentucky Penitentiary\nAttempt to Gain Liberty A Four\nHours Riot.\nONE IS FATALLY WOUNDED\nTiny Disarm Two Guards and Barricade Themselves\nSixty Men Surround the Building and Force a\nSurrender A Convict Forced Into\nService Is Shot.\nFrankfort, Ky., ,Aug. 20.-The offi\ncials of the state penitentiary and the\ncitizens of Frankfort were thrown -into\na state of wild excitement today by a\nriot in the prison started by an attempt\nof the three desperate murderers, La\nfayette Brooks, Wallace Bishop, ana\nt nfniiitrnn tn enin their liberty. Be\nfore the riot, which began at 6 o\'clock,\nand lasted until after 10, was .queued,\nand the mutinous convicts captured,\nBishop was fatally wounded and Mul\nligan was shot in the shoulder, and a\nnoirrn convict. Albert Ransome of\nLouisville, whom the desperadoes had\npressed into service, was \'hit by a rifle\nball. As Brooks, Mulligan and Bishop\nwere coming out of the dining room to\n. answer a hospital call, one of them\ndrew a revolver, compelled the guard,\nA. H. Gill, to give up his arms. Guard\nF. F. Hurst was also captured. Cap\ntain Madigan, acting warden, rushed\nforward, firing on the bunch, but no\none was hit. The convicts, then run\nning across the yard to the chair fac\ntory, captured Charles Willis, foreman\nThey stood Willis at a window and\nBrooks, with a revolver in his hand,\ntook a position just beside the captive,\n- resting the muzzle of his weapon on\nWillis, shoulder. The convicts then\ndefied Warden Lilliard to attempt to\ncapture them, shouting that they\nwould kill the foreman at the first\nmove made against them. By this time\nseveral hundred citizens, many heavi\nly armed, gathered at the prison gates,\nbut the warden denied admission to\nthem all. He placed a guard of 60 men\naround the building in Whleb. the des\nperadoes had barricaded themselves,\nand called on them to surrender. The\nconvicts only reply was a taunt. James\nBuckley, former city work house keep\ner, and Morgan Brewer, a former\nguard of the penitentiary, climbed to\nthe roof of a residence overlooking the\nbuilding in which the convicts \'had ta\nken refuge and fired several shots into\nthe room where the desperadoes were\nin trenched. Thy were compelled to\ndesist however, as Foreman Willis was\nforced to the window in the line of\nfire. He called to the men to stop\nShooting and informed them that a ne\ngro convict, whom the desperadoes had\nforced Into service, had been shot in\nthe shoulder. Finally the men agreed\nto surrender. .As they came down the\nstairway, Bishop dropped his hand to\n"his side as if to draw a weapon. One\nof the warden\'s party fired, the bullet\nstriking Bishop in the breast, inflicting\na fatal wound. The other, two despera\ndoes were placed In their cells. Then it\nwas discovered that Mulligan had been\nwounded in the shoulder, though not\nseriously hurt.\nLater developments show that Ran\nsom1?, the I\'cgro, who was shot, was\nnot pressed into service by the desper\nadoes, but had Joined them after they\n"had entered the rocker department.\nBrooks, Bishop and Mulligan are\namong the most desperate of the 1,500\nconvicts confined here.\nMARKET REPORT.\nMONET AND METAL,\nNew York, Aug. 20.

Fiske, the Santa Fe attor\nney, is boosting up the proposed elec\ntrie power proposition on the Pecos\nriver. Mr. Fiske thinks there in little\ndoubt but that it will be built, as the\npeople who are taking hold of the\nproposition to Install immense water\nturbines at -what la known as the Dal\nton ranch on thf P fop the purpose\nof furnishing Santa Fe and Las Vegas\nwith cheap electric power, are monied\nmen. The company, mostly, are Ohio\ncapitalists, and a couple of brothers by\nthe name of Miller, are pushing the\nscheme and raising the money back\neast. It Is thought a couple of plants\non the Pecos will easily generate 5,000\nhorse power, and the electric fluid\nwill be sent to Santa Fe, about 14\nmiles away, and Las Vegas, about 16\nmiles, by heavy wire. The feasibility\nof the project has been thoroughly in\nvestigated, and the company says\nthere will bo plenty of water in the Pe\ncos at all times of the year to give the\ndesired amount of power. There is a\nstretch of two miles, along Which the\nturbines can be placed. There Is room\nfor four, though it Is contemplated to\nonly put in two at the present time. A.\nR. Gibson of Santa Fe, an enterprising\ncapitalist, is the genius who originated\nthe idea, and it seems there is little\ndoubt but what the power houses will\nbe put In.\nCheap electric power, t",ie best power\nobtainable, will do wonders for the de\nvelopment of New Me\'xico. Manufac\nturing on a large scale Is thereby made\neasily possible, and decidedly profita\nble. With such power, one may take\nas much or as little as he likes. A\nsewing machine may be run at the\nhome, or heavy milling work may be\ndone just as easily, One may then\nbuy power as he would buy any com\nmodity, as mucTi or as little as is wan-i\nted. Here Is hoping that the plant\nmay materialize, and that Las Vegas\nwill get her share of cheap power.

It is a bad\nrailway, and the Denver & Rio Grande\nrailroad, will enhance the value of\nproperty on the south side materially,\nand therefore Santa Fe can well afford\nto donate the lands necessary for the\ncompany\'s right-of-way and depot\ngrounds or to sell them lo the corpor\nation, as said above, at as low a rate\nas possible.\ndone about it?\nToas county is one of the best water\ned of the subdivision of this territory.\nIt contains vast mineral rlc\'lies and\npossesses great agricultural and horti-\'\ncultural possibilities.
