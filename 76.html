Oct. 2S.-The city Imperial\nvolunteers, who arrived at Southamp\nton from South Africa Saturday, reach\ned here by train, this morning and\nmarched through London, along streets\npocked by thousands. Such a demon\nstration was probably never before\nevoked for such a .mall body of volun\nteers. In addition to the city Imper\nlal volunteers themselves, there were\nIn the procession bands of twelve vol\nunteer regiments, and 24.000 regulars\nand volunteer? lined the route.\nThe crush of the populace became to\nterrible that people broke through the\ncordon and when the field was again\ncleared forty persons requiring the aid\nof ambulance surgeons were left lying\non the ground, several suffering serious\ninjuries.\nShrieks and groans filled the air; peo\nple were hurled to the ground and\ntrampled upon. Life guards on horse\nback were swept off and lost In the\nstruggling mass of humanity after Im\npotent struggles to stem the pressure\nof the seml-panlc stricken mob.\nThe list of casualties among the wel\ncoming multitude was longer than that\nof the whole corps In Its twenty-six en\ngagements In South Africa.\nPartial returns from hospitals and po\nlice station Indicate that more than\n200 persons were badly hurt, eight and\npossibly ten being killed. There were\n4000 police and 22,000 troops on duty\nalong the line of march, but they were\nunable to manage the crowds.\nIt was a scene of unchecked saturn\nalia that met the eye. Fighting and\nswearing throngs fought vainly among\nthemselves for right of way. London\nwas turned over to the worst elements\nof its population. Women were Insult\ned, kissed or thrown down with Impu\nnity In the streets fights.\nDE WET DEFEATED.\nBoers Lost Heavily and Abandoned\nGuns and Wagons.\nLONDON, Oct. 29. The war office has\nthe following from Roberts, dated Pre\ntoria. October 2S:\n"Knox successfully engaged De Wet\nOctober 27. During the Boer retreat\nKnox caught De Wet In the Rensburg\ndrift. The Boers lost considerably and\nleft two guns and three wagons in\nKnox\'s hands. ATnother ammunition\nwagon was blown up by a shell. The\nBritish casualties were nil."\nReferring to the Jacobsdal affair.\nLord Roberts says it was due to the\ntreachery of the Inhabitants, who ad\nmitted the Boers to their houses at\nnight. Fourteen men were killed and\nthirteen wounded, mostly Cape High\nlanders. Troop dispatched from the\nModder river drove oft the Boers. The\nhouses of the treacherous Inhabitants\nwere destroyed. Commandant Bosnian\nwas killed.\nLord Roberts calls attention to the\n"increasing Inclination of the better\nclass of Boers to co-operate with the\nBritish to secure peace," since they\nfind that guerilla warfare Is "visited\nwith heavy punishment."\nCABLE TO TATOOSH ISLAND.\nWill Probably Be Built and a Chip\nReporting Station Established.\nWASHINGTON. Oct. 29. -Secretary\nWilson probably will ask congress for\nauthority to build a cable from the\nmainland to Tatoosh island, at the en\ntrance to Puget sound. Wash., and\nthen establish a permanent weather bu\nreau and ship-reporting station there.\nSince the discontinuance of the sta\ntion at that point the San Francisco\nchamber of commerce and other Pacific\ncoast organizations have petitioned for\nIts re-establishment and the enlarge\nment of protection of shipping, especial\nly of vessels In distress. The weather\nInspector has reported favorably on the\nproject and the bureau has recom\nmended It.\nCHINESE FAVOR ARBITRATION.\nChinese Minister to the Russian Court\nDiscusses the Situation.\nNEW YORK. Oct. 29 His Excellency\nYang Yu. Chinese minister to the court\nof St. Petersburg, while at Yalta, near\nwhere the czar Is staying, was ques\ntioned by a Horald correspondent re\ngarding the Chinese problem.\nHis excellency was three and one-half\nyears minister to the United States. He\nwas also Chinese .delegate to the peace\nconference at The Hague. He was\nallied how China would accept the Idea\nof arbitration in this present trouble,\nto which he replied":\n"My own Idea Is that arbitration In\nthis matter would be the ideal solution,\nfor my fear at present Is that unless\nsomething Is done negotiations will drag\non for a long time.\n"Th Idea of arbitration 1. exceedingly\npopular with u. in China. I fear our\npeople would object to a court of arbi\ntration the member of which com\nprised only Europeans. They feel that\nEuropean, are prejudiced against them.\nThey would Imagine that they were not\ngoing to be treated fairly. We should\nhave tn persuade our people that It was\nall right.\n"It is to the Interest of the United\nStates to bring about a normal situa\ntion In China with the utmost rapidity.\nAmerica has a large trade with us and\nthat trade I. being very seriously dam\naged by the condition of things which\nr.iay last a long time."\nHis excellency certainly thought Rus\nsia would support the Idea as the czar\'.\nIdeal was arbitration as shown- by his\ncalling together of the peace confer\nence. Then he oald:\n"England would join because she also\nis suffering severely In the matter of\ntrade, which Is becoming worse each\nday."\nWORK RESUMED.\nAll the Large Collieries Started Up\nYesterday.\nPHILADELPHIA.

Oct. 29. Since the an\nnouncement of the embezzlement of\nNote Teller Atvord. of the Flrat Nation\nal bank, there have been many stories\nof new and rigid espionage by banking\nhouses over their clerks.\nOne of these stories concerns the Ger\nman Savings bank. It was reported\nlast night that five of the clerks of\nthat Institution have been discharged\nbecause detectives discovered that they\nwere associates of gamblers. Three of\nthem are said to have had an interest\nin a bookmaklng firm that does busi\nness at the race tracks.\nThe story recites that detecti.vs were\nplaced on the trail of all of the clerks\nin the bank and that the five In qujs\ntlon were the" only ones about whom\nanything suspicious could be learned.\nIt was not sa!d that the clerks had stol\nen anything nor that they contemplat\ned any wrong-doing, but the informa\ntion is to the effect that the officers of\nthe bank deemed It best to get rid of\ntjem.\nWHEAT MARKET.\nPORTLAND.

His\nwelcome In Elmlra was a great politi\ncal demonstration.\nFor the first time In New York state\nand In the home of the Democratic can\ndidate for governor, Theodore Roose\nvelt was assaulted In the streets of\nElmlra tonight on bis way to places\nof meeting.\nHe was In a carriage with former\nSenator Fasset and at several points\nalong the route was pelted with eggs\nand vegetables and greeted with the\nvilest epithets.

A conflict between\ntwenty-four armed Carlists and a de\ntachment of gendarmes occurred yester\nday near Badalona. The chief of the\nCarlists was killed and another man\nwas wounded. Three Remington rifles\nwere captured. The band retreated In\nthe direction of Moncada, pursued by\ncavalry and Infantry. The Carllst\nGeneral Solivar has been arrested at\nBarcelona, and a number of tjther ar\nrests have been made In connection,\nwith the Bandalona uprising.\nIt appears the Badalona band of Car\nlists, who wore red caps, demanded the\ngendarmes of Badalona to surrender,\nbut the latter attacked and dispersed\nthem. The aim cf the Carlists was to\nseize the municipal treasury, as on the\nbody of the chief was found a receipt\nthus worded:\n"Received from the mayor of Bada\nlona, pesetas, which will be sur\nrendered w hen his majesty, Don Carlos,\noccupies the throne of his ancestors."\nPROMINENT THEATRICAL MAN.\nFormer Manager of the MeCaull Opera\nCompany is Dead In Chicago.\nCHICAGO.

It is not too soon\nto begin an agitatlcn of the question\nso that our representative In congress\nmay know that Oregon !s unalterably\nopposed to the free Immigration of Asia\ntic labor. The present law should be\nso modified, however, that Chinese\nstudents may be freely admitted and\nallowed to remain so long as they are\nbona fide students at some one of our\ninstitutions of learning. The quicker\nthe more ambitious and more enllght\nened classes of the Chinese become fa-\nniliar with our Institutions, our cus\nurns and manner of living so much\nthe faster will our commerce with the\nOrfcnt expand.

The New York\nstate labor bureau shows the number\nof employes and the wag\'s paid In\nsixty-six leading districts of the com\nmonwealth during each of the nine\nyears from 18S1 to 1899, inclusive. The\nresults substantiate the Massachusetts\ncomparison.\nUnder a Democratic low tariff pros\nperity took wings and flew away; under\nthe Dingley protective tariff it returned\nand was glad to get back.\nThere\' was a steady increase during\neach year of Harrison\'s and McKlnley\'s\nadministrations, both In the number of\npersons employed and total wage paid\nand a decline In those Items during\nCleveland\'s administration. For" the\nyear ending June 20, 1S99, which was the\nnig MORNING\nmrt prosperous year, on record m ih\nI\'liited States, the Increase In the cm\ninvj.urci. ur taoor was nearly to per\ncent,, a contrasted with l$i4. the first\nyar of unrestricted free trade tariff\nUgWaUon. During the last two years\nof the Harrison administration and the\nfirst two year of the McKlnley ad\nministration, the men In the lxty-s\nNew Tork establishments received $14,\nvw.wu in wages. During Cleveland"\nfour years they received only $:),000,WO,\nProsperity shlea at a Democratic ad\nministration.\nTO CIRC K COLD IS ONC DAT\nTake Laxative Bromo Quinine Tablets.\nAll druggists refund th money -f\nfalls to cure.

There is considerable feeling In the\ngrain trade over this action of the roads,\nthe complaint being that a heavy in\ncrease has been made without previous\nnotice and that the New Tork railroads\nthus discriminate arbitrarily against\nthis port In favor of all rival ports.\nReport are current in the trade that\nas a direct result of this action large\nquantities of grain have already been\ndiverted to Philadelphia and Boston\nwblch the New Tork firms endeavored\nto ship via this port, but which the\nrailroads in the pool refused to make\na rate on.\nCHINESE EXCLUSION ACT.\nAgitation Must Soon Be Commenced to\nSecure Its Re-enforcement.\nNEW TORK.

Oct. .-A special to\nthe Herald frcm Washington says:\nAn earnest plea for a government\ncable across the Pacific Ocean Is maje\nby Lieutenant John Hood, of the navy,\nwho performed notable work In the sur\nvey which definitely established a sat\nisfactory route. In an article published\nIn the current number of the Proceed\nings of the Naval Institute.\n"If we wish to secure ourselves\nagainst ail eventualities and be fully\nequipped to take our part successfully\nin the struggle of races that the Inevit\nable laws of evolution force us to en\nter, let us." says Lieutenant Hood, "not\nonly fortify our ports, build fleets and\nequip armies, but let us by all means\nprepare the way to render these fleets\nand armies efficient and capable of their\nutmost usefulness by supplying them\nwith the safe, sure and prompt informa\ntion so necessary to any successful un\ndertaking. The only way to attain this\nend with certainty and success la for\nthe government to lay and operate Its\nown cables and to construct, equip and\nman Its own cable ships: and the be\nginning of this great work cannot be\nmade too soon."\nLieutenant Hood takes a Wry pessi\nmistic view of the chances of cable leg\nislation. For a time, he says. It seemed\nprobable that action would be taken,\nbut now it may be safely said all cable\nlegislation Is dead for the present and\nis more than likely to remain dead\nfor a long time to come, while a merry\nlight goes on between the opposing\nIdeas of government and private own\nership. "For a sure defence," continues the\nlieutenant, "both for our own coasts\nand of our Island possessions. It Is abso\nlutely necessary for the American fleet\nto have perfect freedom of movement\nto all parts of our coasts. To carry\nout any design for the protection and\nextension of our Influent-? In our far\ndistant possessions It is necessary to\nhave absolutely sure communication be\ntween our fleets and our seat of govern\nment. The former of these objects can\nonly be attained by the construction of\na national Inter-oceanic canal and the\nlatter by a national Pacific cable."\nLieutenant ilood calls a\'tention to the\nfact that surety and secrecy can only be\nattained by a cable owned, controlled\nand worked by the government Itself,\nby Its own agents.\n"Admiral Cervera\'s book," he says,\n"shows how utterly impossible it Is in\ntime of war to preserve secrecy with\nprivate cables. In spite of all the ef\nforts of this government to isolate Cuba\nand suppress all dispatches regarding\nthe movements of our ships, we are as\ntonished to find how minutely General\nBlanco and Admiral Cervera were In\nformed of the movements of our ships\nand squadrons, even -n our own coasts.\nFrom a military point of vie th?\nquestion of the nationality of the opera\ntors is most Important. No foreigner\nor alien of any description should be\nallowed to have any connection\nwith the line In any capacity whatever.\nIts direction ard jp\'ration should be\nAmerican, pure and simple, or betrayal\nof trust will surely follow.\n"One other great military advantage\nof a national over a private cable is the\npossession by the government of prop\nerly equipped and manned cable ships.\nIn the conflicts of the future the cable\nand cable ship are dr-stlned to play a\npart hardly nec.jnla.ry to that of the\narmy and navy. It may be taken as an\naxiom, In future wars between nations\nwith outlying possessions, that a cable\nwar will go on aide by side with mili\ntary operations, and that nation which\nhas failed to provide :tslf with cables\nand cable layln? and cutting appliances\nwill be worsted."\nBRAZIL A.N\'D ARGENTINA.\nClose Frier.-lcMrj Signalized at a Ban\nquet.

He\nsaid that the American republics are\ngiving to the world a glorious example\nof the application of arbitration to the\nsettlement of International questions.\nHe added that Presid\'-nt Roca, dur\ning his recent visit to Rio de Janeiro,\nexpxfcssed Uie sentiment that the friend\nship of Brazil Is worth more than any\npiece of Brazilian territory.

Xow that the vestrle are re\ngrouped and transformed Into twenty\neight borough council with mayors, the\nobligation of cltlienshlp Invite oulnlt\nreflection. SI\nThe councils will be empowered to\nexpend about $15,000,000 annually, In an\narea of 125 square miles with a popula\ntion of ovtr live million, while the Lon\ndon county council disposes of $50,000 -\n000. They will be something more than\nsub-municipal agencies and centers,\nalthough Lord Rosebery\' "federallied\nLondon" seems a rhetorical expression\nan! the tendencies of decentralisation\nare more potent than the force of\ncentralisation.\nAs the lists of candidates are made up\nmainly of former vestrymen. It seems\nprobable that the business of lighting,\npaving and cleaning the streets will be\nconducted by the same men on the old\nlines and that there will be no radical\nchange in the system of local govern\nment.\nIn consequence of the adoption of the\nnew municipal mechan\'sm one thing is\nalready noticeable a tendency to drag\nnational politics Into local contests.\nThe Conservatives have dropped the\nrame of Moderates and are striving to\ncarry borough elections on part" lines.\nW.
