        <pre>['V II M\nWEATHER\nFair; Warmer\nFriday.\nVOL. ni NO. 96\nKAWMDIDE. MRS\nTonopah and Goldfield Peo\nple are Getting in Strong\nComing Into Camp From\nEvery Direction.\nTonopah and Goldfield are gotting into Rawhide strong, and\nthe camp is looking better in every respect, every day. Among\nthose who returned yesterday from the new gold field was Attor\nney L. A. Gibbons. This is the second trip of Mr. Gibbons, and\nhe is more enthused over the situation than ever, and the chances\nare that he will go back an permanently settle.\n"People are coming into the camp\nfrom all directions, and coming in\nvery rapidly. They are filling up the\ncamp, and since I was there three\nweeks ago there are at least 150\ntents and houses that have been put\nup. There was quite a number of\npeople got in there from Goldfield\nduring the past week. Billy Bond,\nof the firm of W. F. Bond & Co. of\nColdfleld, took up a fraction near the\nGrutt property, for himself and as\nsociates, and they are going to work\nit right away. John Reynolds, an\nother broker from Goldfield, and\nMarvin Ish were also in the earn p.\nJ. L. Kalfus, one of the Mohawk\nleasers In Goldfield, has taken over\nthe Black , Buttes, which is located\nnear the Last Chance and the Bluff\nLode, the latter being the well\nknown property of Zeb Kendall.\n"San Francisco has also evidently\nawakened to the possibilities of the\njiew camp, for there were several\npeople in there from the metropolis,\nand they were all looking for invest\nments. There seems to be a good\ninquiry from San Francisco regard\ning the Royal Tiger.\n"Billy Mikulich, who used to be\nhere and was later at Manhattan,\nand still later in San Francisco, is\nin Rawhide. He has secured a prop-\nerty on Balloon Hill, and is going to\nopen a brokerage office. The Raw\nhide John Patrick Mining Company\n"has been organized, comprising some\nclaims near the Royal group. The\n, latter group is looking better than\nver. :\n"Real estate is away up in the air.\nLots on Main street are held at pro\nhibitive prices, if indeed there are\nany for sale. The prices are dis\ncouraging to anyone who contem\nplates going into the mercantile\nbusiness. But they are going fast\nover there. Plans for a stock ex--change\nare already under way, and\nthey are getting subscriptions for\nmemberships quite readily.\n"The first issue of the Dally Raw\nhide Rustler was to make its appear\nance this afternoon. The sign over\nthe office of the Rustler can be seen\nall over the camp;\' it is the biggest\nthing in town.\n"Another good thing in favor of\nthe camp Is the fact that there is\nconsiderable leasing going oh in the\nflat near Jinnpertown. Burt Oppen\nhaver and .lack Humphrey have a\nlease there\' which is looking all right\nand there is another lease the own\ners of which I cannot remember,\nwhich has the pure quill. There are\nmore Tonopah people in the camp\nthan any other people, and It looks\ngood to bump Into one of them at\nnearly every step. Now, the Gold\nfield people are getting in. and you\nmay expect nothing but a stirring\ncamp."\nWhile Mr. Gibbons was in Raw\nhide, he officiated at the first funeral\nof the camp. Dave Welch, an old\nConistocker, died of pneumonia, and\nas there was no minister in the camp,\nMr. Gibbons was called upon to per\nform the Itinera! ceremonies, which\nlie did very gracefully. Posters were\nexhibited around the town telling of\nthe far! of llie lawyer accepting the\nministerial functions.\nK. 10. Htirdlck, the well known\ncontractor, left yesterday morning\nTONOPA\nMRPUE\nCONN\nfor Rawhide, where he h&3 consid\nerable interests. He has put up\ntwo-story hotel, and has built many\nother structures.\n"Shorty" Kendall will leave this\nmorning for the camp. Mr. Kendall\nowns the controlling Interest in the\nBluff Lode claim, which has been in\ncorporated. He and his associates\nare well pleased with the develop\nments on the property, there being\nten leasers on the claim. R. E. Kirk,\na mining man, who - has been here\nfor several months, and who has\nmined from the Klondike to Mexico\n(Continued on Page Four.)\nTURK IS GROWING\nMORE PEACEFUL\n(By Associated Press.)\nST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 13. The\nwithdrawal of Turkish troops from\nthe Persian territory to the west of\nTabriz, as well as the more concilia\ntory spirit shown at Constantinople,\nis regarded here as obviating the\nnecessity for the present of taking\nfurther precautionary measures on\nthe Turkish and Persian frontiers,\nand it is probable that the dispatch\nof troops from the interior of Persia\nto the Caucausus will be abandoned\npending further developments. Thus\nthe alarming statements that Russia\nwas concentrating a force of 60(000\nmen for military \' demonstration\nagainst Turkey can be dismissed, for\ntoday the outlook is decidedly better\nand more peaceful. \' , .\',\nLOW RATES FOR\nSUMMER TRAVEL\n(By Associated Press.)\nCHICAGO, Feb. 13. At a joint\nconference today at the committees\nnppointed by the Western Passenger\nand Central Passenger associations t\nwas decided that it would be advis\nable to grant summer tourist rates\nduring the coming season.\nAt the general meeting of the Cen\ntral Passenger Association to be held\ntomorrow the committee, will recoiii\'\nmend that, the same summer tourisi\nrates be granted as were in effect last\nsummer.

The report is\nagain current in banking circles that\nthe Japanese government is trying to\nfloat a loan In Paris through the\nDuuque de Paris et Dec Pays Ba.\nAn official of this bank said today\nthin a commission sent by it to .lapau\nhad jusl let limed, but further than\nthis he would make no statement.\nThe Japanese Embassy declined I.)\nconfirm or deny the report, but it\nwus Intimated tliHt n statement re\nlative to this mutter might be given\nout tomorrow.\nDaily Bonanza\nTONOPAH, NEVADA, FRIDAY\nmm\n. -\nRawhide is connected with\nthe outside world by telegraph.\nThe line from the camp to\nSchurz was completed yester-\nday, and the first message went\nover the wires. One message\nwent from Tonopah to the new\ncamp.\nThis is another instance of\nthe progress of the new camp.\nRawhide is not yet six months\nold, and to be already connect-\ned with the outside world by\nwire certainly looks got! for\nthe future of the camp.\nWILL REVIEW\nAMERICAN FLEET\n(By Associated Press.)\nSANTIAGO, Chile, Feb. 13.-\nEverything is in readiness at Val\nparaiso for a review of the American\nfleet as it passes that port on its way\nto Callao.

The early\nstock market today presented graph\nic evidence that an important pro\nportion of conspicuous selling, which\ncarried prices downward on Monday\nand again in closing dealings on\nTuesday, must have been rather reck\nless operations on the short side of\nthe market. When those sellers felt\nImpelled to cover their contracts to\nday they found a scarcity of stocks\noffering and a rather mercurial up\nshoot of prices resulted. Almost\nequally striking was the relaxed tone\nof the market when the needs of un\ncovered bears had been satisfied. The\nday\'s developments bearing on the\ngeneral situation were not important.\nReports of some additional mill re\nsumptions also were made a feature.\nBonds were irregular.\nBARTNETT WILL\nBE TRIEO FIRST\nSAX FRANCISCO, Feb. 13.

The cropping is\nwithin eight feet of the shaft. After\nthe crosscut has been run, we will\ncontinue the shaft to the 200 level,\ncrosscutting at every fifty feet.

R. Nash, who successfully drill\ned the Monnette well oh the flat\nthree miles west of Fairview, will\nwithin the next thirty days begin the\nsinking of a well to furnish Rawhide\nwith an adequate supply of water\nfor both domestic consumption and\nfire protection.\nMr. Nash is an expert in well-\ndrilling, and has thoroughly pros\npected the ground around Rawhide\nfor a well site. He has finally de\ncided on a location about two miles\nnorth of town, on the plateau, and\nat the edge of the Sand Springs road.\nThe elevation of this site is about\n150 feet above that of the camp,\nand by pumping into a large storage\ntank at the well, Mr. Nash says it\nwill be possible to get a gravity flow\ndown to the camp that will not only\nsupply water to all parts of the town\nbut that will give sufficient pressure\nin the pipes to throw a fire-fighting\nstream over any building that may\nbe erected here.\nIn the opinion of this expert, it\nwill not be necessary to go deepen\nthan 350 to 400 feet at the site se\nlected in order to obtain a supply\nof water sufficient for all needs. It\nis Mr. Nash\'s intention,\' as soon as\nthe rib la set, to drill with both a\nday and night shift, and it will thus\nbe possible to make fifty feet a day\nin the hole. "In twenty days after\nthe rig is in position, we should be\nable to supply the camp with water,\'\nsays Mr. Nash.\nThe only delay about startin\ndrilling is Mr. Nash\'s desire to give\nthe owners of the Monnette well at\nFairview a chance to consider conv\ning in on the project. The capital\nfor the enterprise is all ready, and\na complete drilling outfit can be se\ncured with little loss of time. It\nwill, however, hasten matters coiv\nsiderably if the owners of the Mon\nnette well decide to join hands with\nAir. Nash. There is at that well,\nnear Fairview, a complete drilling\noutfit, with engines, cables, bits, and\nall the necessary tools and machine\nery for drilling to a depth of 1000\nfeet. It is the desire of Mr. Nash\nto at least get the use of this outfit\nas with it at his disposal there would\nbe no delay whatever, and the well\ncould be sunk to water in thirty days\nfrom this time. He is waiting now\nto hear. whether his negotiations for\nthe outfit will result successfully\nShould they do so, he will begin the\ndrilling in the next ten days or two\nweeks.\nIn the well at Fairview, at a depth\nof 800 feet, Mr. Nash secured a flow\nof 24,000 gallons a day with a pump\nthat ouly gave eleven strokes to the\nminute The company has ordered\na 26-horse power engine for the\nwell, which will give 30 strokes a\nminute on the pumps, and when this\nis installed, it is expected that the\nf-pumps will be.aDie to nit au.uuu\ngallons in a little more than twelve\nhours.\nShould the drilling here prove\nsuccessful, and a, sufficient flow of\nwater be secured, Mr. Nash and his\nassociates will lay mains into and\nthroughout the camp, and be in\nposition to furnish water through\nhydrants at a very low price. Fair\nview News.\nST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 13.

It\nBIG MILL FOR\nSEVEN TROUGHS\nThe work of grading for the $25,\'\n000 ten-stamp mill of the Seven\nTroughs Kindergarten Mining Com\npany, north of the company\'s works\nin Seven Troughs canyon, which was\nstarted last week is making good\nheadway. While it will be pushed\nwith considerable diligence, there is\nno particular need for haste in its\ncompletion, as it unquestionably will\nbe several weeks before the Nevada\nEngineerings Works of Reno, to\nwhich the mill contract was award\ned, will be able to deliver the ma\nterials for the buildings and the mill\nitself, upon the ground.\nWord comes from Reno, however,\nthat President A. J. McCone and\nManager R. F. Roy, of the engineer\ning works are using every effort to\nsecure timber and other materials for\nthe mill buildings in the local mar\nket. Providing they are successful\nin this direction, the work of con\nstructing the mill buildings will be\nmaterially lessened, as considerable\ntime will be required if it becomes\nnecessary for them to send away for\nmaterials. When in this district last\nweek, President McCone expressed\nthe belief that it would not be ne\ncessary to send a great distance for\nthese materials, and that he would\nprobably deliver them on the mill\nsite in a few weeks. Naturally, it\nwould require a considerably longer\nperiod to make delivery of the mill\nitself, together with the concentrat\ning tables and- the other machinery\non the ground, and, with the com\npletion of the grading work, the con\nstruction of the mill will be com\nparatively slow. However, every ef\nfort will be made to have the mill\ncompleted at the earliest possible\ndate. It is a certainty that it will\nbe in operation by the first of May\nat the latest.\nLeasing operations throughout the\ndistrict, and especially in Seven\nTroughs canyon, has been greatly\nstimulated through the beginning of\nwork on the mill. This is due to the\nfact that leasers, who have been hin\ndered during the past few months by\nreason of the depression of the mon\ney market, but who had good milling\nore In sight, now see their way clear\nto realize upon their ores in the r.cur\nfuture thorugh the construction of\nthe mill. Many leasers have already\nresumed operations and many others\nare preparing to do likewise.

While the stocks of Wall street are in\nunsatisfactory shape, the industries all over the country are getting in\nbetter condition each day. Each day there is a demand for more men,\nand news comes of big institutions resuming work. Yesterday the St.\nLouis Iron and Steel Company put to work 900 men, and in a few days\n400 more men will go to work in the tinplute plants. The government\nlias ordered a hundred thousand stands of arms to be furnished to the\nmilitia throughout, the country, all of which means better times.\nThere is always uncertainty in the days preceding the national con\nventions, but this year the issues are pretty well settled upon, and it is\npretty well understood who the candidates will be. The conventions\nwlil be over in July, and business will be on a more stable foundation.\nThe talk of war has been a disturbing element in some quarters, but a\nwar with Japan would have a beneficial effect rather than a deterrent\ncue. It would wake the apathetic up and it would create more business\nli the United States than anything el\' e. The last war we had, although\ncruel and deplorable, was the best thing that had happened to us for\nmany years, und when it was over w? were on a more prosperous footing\nthan we had been in a long time. Wloting occurred here this evening\nJapanese seem determined that we shall have it; so it will probably be\nnecessary to give the little brown men a lesson in good manners.\nThe breaking away of the small traders troni Vall street is a good\nign for the l.cks of Nevada, for it is to those securities that the in\nvestors ard speculators will turn. The mins of this camp were never\nin better condition, and the stocks n-ver offer-jd a better opportunity for\ninvestment or speculation. The same can be said of Nevada\'s new El\nDorado, Rawhide.\nRAWHIDE HAS\nTELEGRAPH LINE\n(Continued from Page 1.)\nwill be another passenger for the new\ngold field.\nAV. B. Pittman,. the well known\nlawyer, will go tomorrow morning\nto Rawhide. Mr. Pittman has al\nready made several deals in the\ncamp, and has other interests. On\nthis trip he is going to establish .1\nbranch of his law office in Rawhide.\nRAWHIDE ORE\n. EXCITES PEOPLE\nCHINA WORRIED\nOVER FRONTIER\nPEKING, Feb. 13. Border com\nplications and the successes of the\nrebels on the French border, due, it\nis believed, to foreign assistance,\nhave Induced the Chinese govern\nment to hasten the organization of\nher modern drilled troops at all the\nfrontier points. The government\nproposes again to send Prince Su to\nMongolia for the purpose of develop\ning plans looking to the organization\nof defenses for frontier districts. A\nmodern drilled skeleton brigade is\nnow on its way to Thibet for the pur\npose of organizing a Thibetan divi-\n: sion.\nThe fact that the Indo-Thibet\ntrade convention has not been con\n- eluded prevents, for the present, the\nevacution of the Chumbi valley by\nthe British troops. This delay tends\nto bring Great Britain into conflict\nwith the Anglo-Russian convention,\nwhich regulates the respective inter\nests of these two powers in Thibet,\nAfghanistan and Persia, and which\n. China is using for the purpose of re\nducing Great Britain\'s right in deal\ning directly with the Thibetans to\nthe minimum. China is striving to\nsecure an exact definition of Great\nBritain\'s relations with Thibet.\nRAILWAY FORCE\n. IS JUT DOWN\nRENO. Feb. 13. Lack of business\nis believed to have been the cause ot 1\nthe order for the closing down of the\nmachine shops at Sparks received\nfrom the Southern Pacific officials\nthere today. One hundred and fifty\nmen will be laid off at the start,\nthough in the neighborhood of 250\nwill be affected by the order. No\nreason is given for the action by the\nrailroad officials, and how long the\norder is to remain in force no one\nseems to know.\nThough not as many trains are be\ning handled by the company at pres\nent as in the past, there is still work\nenough on hand at the shops to keep\nthe present force steadily employed\nfor some time to come. Because of\nthis the hope is expressed that the\nsuspension is only temporary and\nthat work will be resumed within a\nshort time.\nBUTLER PUTS ON\nNEW BILL TONIGHT\nThe Butler theater lias a new bill\nfor tonight and it promises to be one\n\'of the strongest bills that has yet\nbeen put on, every picture being a\nfeature. , The leaders are "A Doc\ntor\'s Reformation," "A Tale of the\nSea," "The Little Orphan," and "The\nUnlucky Shirt Waist."

Mrs. Brown said the\nMontgomery\'s had cared for the child\nwhile she was working, and that she\nwas unable to pay the amount they\nasked for its care.\nSAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 13.\nSpecial correspondence of the Reno\nJournal: Mining circles of this city\nmaintain an unflagging interest in\nthe new camp of Rawhide, as has\nbeen demonstrated during the past\nfew days here by the attention at\ntracted by a very fine display of rock\nfrom the new camp, brought here by\nDonough and Clifford of the Grutt\ncompany.\nThe lobby of the Holland has been\na veritable reception room in which\na great many people have congre\ngated to look at this ore and ask\nquestions concerning it and the new\ncamp. The rock displayed is a fine\nbluish quartz, of not too fine grain,\nshowing a stringer of almost solid\ngold, varying in width from a hair to\nthree-quarters of an inch, and carry\ning also about 1500 ounces of silver\nto the ton.\nDonough and Clifford explain that\nthe rock is from their lease on the\nGrutt property, better known as\nlease No. 3, and from the adjoining\nground on the Grutt fraction, on\nboth of which properties they have\nsunk a 50-foot shaft, and started to\ncrosscut. The samples of high grade\nshown, are from a small stringer in\nthe heart of a 22-inch vein, contain\ned in a ledge of about six feet.\n"There are upwards of thirty\nleases working in the new camp\nnow," said Mr. Donough, "where\nthere are. all told, about 3000 peo\npie. There was a time not long\nsince when money was very scarce\nthere, and it was hard on the out\nsider unless he came there well pro\nvided with money, but now it is no\ndifferent from any other camp in\nthat respect, and I will venture to\nsay that there are fewer people there\nwho are really hard up than any\ncamp in the State.\n"Regarding the outlook as to la\nbor, I do not anticipate any trouble\nat Rawhide such as has been experi\nei.ced in other parts of the State.\nWe have the most conservative and\nLest lot of men at the head of the\nunions there that I have ever met,\nt\'hd it would see mini possible to con\nceive of a situation arising where\nthey are concerned, which could not\nbe readily and \'easily adjusted.\n"I expect Rawhide, within the next\ncouple of years to be the greatest\nproducing camp in the State, and I\nthink that length of time is setting\nthe margin plenty wide enough. It\nwould be no use trying to tell you\nmuch about the mines or prospects\nthere, because they beat anything I\nhave ever seen, and I do not care to\nbe quoted as telling things which\ncommon sense tells me would not be\nbelieved, yet which are true. We\nhave the gold, and lots of it, so it\nfollows that we will shortly have a\ntown worthy of our mines."\nMr. Donough and Mr. Clifford will\nleave for Los Angeles this evening,\nand may return to Rawhide via Gold-field.\nJERE REVERE IS\nHADE SERGEANT\nGOLDFIELD, FtV 13.
