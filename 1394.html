Could\n(that a single Sioux would approach\nSparty of their strength? They\nittehed the rider without anxiety,\ntby were so near the goal now that\n£taar party of sufficient strength to\n«une a menace was likely to he gath\nisd.

Hisblanket I A\na\n!\na\nto\ndropped around his hips, and\npeating carbine rose to his face. Both\nwheelers dropped at the first shot,\nkilled by a single ounce slug. A\nrapid fusillade of shots was distrib\nuted among the struggling mules,\nand then the Sioux was off, shaking\nhis gun and yelling defiance, his pony\ngoing in zigzag leaps and like the\nwind.\nMen ran tumbling over each other to\nget into the wagon and at their guns.\nThe teamster and two or three oth\ners who, despite the cold, carried re\nvolvers under their greatcoats, jerked\ntheir mittens and fumbled with stiff\nfingers for their weapons. They had\nnot been nerved up with excitement,\nlike the Sioux, and before they could\nbring their guns to bear, the savage\nwas well out upon the prairie.\nAnd when these men tried, with\nrifle or revolver, to shot at the swift\nly moving erratic mark presented by\nthe cunning Sioux and his rabbit-like\npony, the cutting wind numbed their\nfingers and filled their eyes with wa\nter, the glistening snow obscured\ntheir front sights, and they pelted\nwhite waste harmlessly with bul\nlets.\nThe anger which raged in them\nwhen they knew the Sioux had es\ncaped scot-free was something fright\nful. Six mules of the splendid eight\nlay welting in blood; another was dis\nabled, and only one had come off\nwithout hurt. Half the counties of\nnorthwestern Iowa had been scoured\nto get together "Gordon\'s Pride," as\nthis fine freight team had been named\nbefore the party left Sioux City.\nThe blight of their hopeful expedi\ntion, the frightful peril of their sit\nuation, were lost sight of in the ab\nsorbing desire for revenge which\nburned in every man of them as they\ngazed upon the stricken, stiffening\nheap of animals. All were for giving\nchase immediately. They believed they\nrau» ....j ----------- j I\ncould easily overtake the Sioux among\nthe drifts of the lower lands, where\ncreeks and snow-filled ravines must I\ncause him to shift his course contin-1\nually. I\nBoys," said, Gordon, when some of I\nthem had hastily begun to strip for I\nthe chase, "boys, this is my particu\nlar affair. You make camp and fix it\nfor fightin\'. I\'ll either get that Sioux,\nor he\'ll fetch his tribe back an\' get\n€y Gordon was their captain. He\nhad been a hay and wood contractor\nfor many years in the Sioux country,\nand his word was law to this little\nhand.\nThere was no need to argue that no\nman could have even guessed at the\ndaring and disaster they had looked\nupon. The performance had been\ntoo appallingly simple and easy. It\nhad come as unexpectedly as the flood\nof a cloudburst or the bursting of\ngun.\nWhile his men stood vengefully\nwatching the flying Sioux, Gordon\nstripepd himself of superfluous wrap\npings, stocked his pockets with frozen\nbread and cartridges, slipped on a pair\nof snowshoes kept for emergency,\ntightened his belt, and launched him\ntightened\nself in pursuit.\nHorse and rider were again no more\nthan a speck upon the vast snow\nfield. Gordon, with an "express" rifle\nunder his arm, took the long, swing-1\ning stride of the accomplished snow\nshoer. In an hour the speck upon the\nsnow had not grown smaller. I\nAt high noon, by the sun, upon a\nbroad flat where tall grass held the\nsnow, Gordon came almost within hui- I\nlet range of the Sioux. An hour later, |\namong a tangle of drifted ravines,\nthere was an exchange of shots, and\nthe Sioux\'s pony dropped in its tracks.\nThe Indian dodged out of sight, and\nGordon pushed warily on with a grin\nof hate under his icicles,\nHe took up the Sioux tracks, and\nnoted with satisfaction that the In\ndian\'s moccasined feet punched\nuiaua »«-î\nthrough the light crust at every other\n" V . 8 „vn„i\nstep.

At a turn of the river he saw\nthe Sioux; but there were others, more\nthan a score of them, mounted and ap\nproaching the runner. The mule-kill\ner\'s camp or town was close at hand.\nExhausted from .his long run, Gor\ndon, in his own language, "threw up\nthe sponge." He hastily sought the\ncover of river drifts and scooped him\nself a kind of rifle pit. Then, with a I\npile of cartridges between his knees I\nand slapping his hands to keep his I\nfingers ready for action, he waited, I\nmeaning to do what execution he could j\nbefore the end.\nThere was considerable parley among\nthe Sioux, and then only a single In\ndian advanced toward the white man.\nThis one came on afoot within gun\nshot, then stopped and shook his blan\nket, in token that he wanted to ap-1\nproach and talk.\nGordon laughed. The situation I\nseemed to him grimly humorous. He I\nmotioned to the Indian to come on, and\nkept him well covered with hia rifle.\nA moment later, however, he lowered\nhia gun-.\nWhatever fate awaited Gordon, he\nknew that he stood in no danger of a\ntreacherous stroke from the approach\ning Sioux. It was the chief, Red Cloud.\nGordon arose, and the chief came\nforward with a hand outstretched.\nMy young man has killed your mules,"\nwas Red Cloud\'s greeting in the Sioux\ntongue.\nGordon understood. "Yes," he said-,\n"and I will not take your hand until\nyou have done right."\nThe grave old chief drew his blanket\nabout his shoulders with a shrug.\n"Now listen," he said. "If one of your\nsoldiers had approached a party of my\nsoldiers and had killed all their horses,\nand so crippled them and escaped, your\npeople would 1 have made him a big cap\ntain. It is so. My young man is very\nbrave. He did as he was told. You\ncannot come here and take my country\n—not yet. I have watched your ad\nvance and complained to your soldiers\nat White River. When I saw they did\nnot go out and catch you as our Great\nFather has said they should do, I sent\nmy young man to stop you. You will\nfind your soldiers at the three forks of\nWhite River. Now go!\nAnd without another word Red 1 Cloud\nturned upon his heel and stalked away.\nDr.\nthe\n!\nThis time Gordon was glad enough I\nto obey the injunction to "go." Three\ndays later his little party filed in at the\nmilitary camp on White River, and\nwhen, some time afterward, their boxes [\nof freight had been recovered-, not so\nmuch as a blanket or a pound of sugar |\nhad been taken by Red Cloud\'s Sioux.\nODD MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.\nA Nuremberg: Lever Find« HU Sweet«\nheart Cooped I« in\nuu Oven.\nIt\nA baker in Nuremberg, German}-, re\ncently proposed marriage to a girl in\nI a singular manner.

Minna had been keeping\nI house for Henry for the last few years, I\nI and gradually the two had fallen very\nmuch in love with each other. Minna,\nit however, would have died sooner than\nlet Henry know how she felt toward\n| him, and Henry was equally bashful.\nFinally he went for advice to an old\n1 woman in the neighborhood who makes\na living by telling fortunes, and she\nno |\nj\ncounseled him to go during the next\nfull moon into the large kitchen where\nhis bread was baked, and when tho\nclock struck midnight to open the oven\nand look into it.

On the site of this village,\nnow in ruins, and: all around this lake\nwhat scenes of kindness and power and\nglory and pathos when our Lord lived\nhere! I can understand the feeling of\nthe immortal Scotchman, Robert Me\nCheyne, when, sitting on the banks of\nthis lake, he wrote:\nIt Is not that the wild gazelle\nComes down to drink thy tide.\nBut He that was pierced to save from\nhell\nOft wandered by thy side.\nGraceful around thee the mountains meet.\nThou calm, reposing sea.\nBut. ah, far more the beautiful feet\nOf Jesus walked o\'er thee.\nI can easily understand from the con\ntour of the country that bounds this\nlake that storms were easily tempted\nto make these waters their playground\nThis lake, in Christ\'s time, lay in a\nscene of great luxuriance; the sur\nrounding hills, terraced, sloped,\n.----- ~ , .\nI groved; so many hanging gardens o\nbeauty.

It\nseemed as if the Lord had launched one\nwave of beauty on all the scene and it\nhung and swung from rock and hill and\noleander. Roman gentlemen in pleas\nure boats sailing this lake and country\nmen in fishing smacks coming down to\ndrop their nets pass each other with\nJ\nnod and shout and laughter or swing\ning idly at their moorings. Oh, what a\nbeautiful scene!\nIt seems as if we shall have a quiet\nnight. Not a leaf quivered in the air\nnot a ripple disturbed the face of Gen\nI nesaret.

Christ is in the stern of\nthe boat. His disciples are in the bow\nand amidships.

If there was any motion at\nall, the ship was easily righted; if the\nwind passed from starboard to lar\nboard, or from larboard to starboard\nthe boat would rock and, by the gentle\nness of the motion, putting the Master\nasleep. And they extemporized a pil\nlow made out of a fisherman\'s coat. I\nthink no sooner is Christ prostrate and\nHis head touched the pillow than He is\nBound asleep. The breezes of the lake\nrun their fingers through the locks of\nthe worn sleeper, and the boat rises\nand falls like a sleeping child on the\nbosom of a sleeping mother.\nThat great personage lifts His head\nfrom the pillow of the fisherman\'s\ncoat, walks to the front of the vessel\nand looks out into the storm. All\ndriven in the tempest, and through it\nI comes the erv of drowning men. By\ncomes the cry of drowning men. By\nthe flash of the lightning I see the\ncalm brow of Christ as the spray\ndropped from His beard. He has one\nword for the sky and another for the\nwaves. Looking upward, He cries:\n"Peace!" Looking downward, He\n"Be still!" The waves fall flat\ni »ve\n* a J s - ..\non their faces, the foam melts the ex\ntinguished stars relight their torches,\nThe tempest falls dead, and Christ\nHig foot on the neck of\nb&1 out t he boats and while they\n^ trying to untangle the cordage\ndisciples stand in amazement, now\nlooking into the calm sea, then into\nthe calm sky, then into the calm\nSaviour\'s countenance, and they cry\nout: "What manner of man Is this,\nthat even the winds and the sea obey\nj Him?"\n\'\nI\nThe subject, in the first place, im\npresses me with the faet that it is\nvery important to have Christ in the\nahip; for all those boats would have\ngone to the bottom of Gennesaret if\nChrist had not been present. Oh,\nwhat a lesson for you and for me te\nlearn! Whatever voyage we under\ntake, into whatever enterprise we\netart, let ns always have Christ in the\nI\nship. All you can do with utmost\ntension of body, mind and soul you\nare bound to do; but, oh, have Christ I\nav«x eatarpriasl —--- j\na\nof\nis\nof\nat\nI\nis\nof\nThere are men who ask God\'s help\nat the beginning of great enterprises.\nHe has been with them in the past;\nno trouble can overthrow them; the\nstorms might come down from the\ntop of Mount Hermon and lash Gen\nnesaret into foam and into agony,\nbut it could not hurt them. But here\nis another man who starts out in\nworldly enterprise, and he depends\nupon the uncertainties of this life.\nHe has no God to help him. After\nawhile the storm comes, tosses off the\nmasts of the ship; he puts out his life\nboat and the long boat; the sheriff\nand the auctioneer try to help him\noff; they can\'t help him off; he must\ngo down; no Christ in the ship. Your\nlife will be made up of sunshine and\nshadows. There may he in it arctic\nblasts or tropical tornadoes; I know\nnot what is before you, but I know if\nyou have Christ with you all Bhall be\nwell. You may seem to get along\nwithout the religion of Christ while\neverything goes smoothly, but after\nawhile, when sorrow hovers over the\nsoul, when the waves of trial dash\nclear over the hurricane deck and the\ndecks are crowded with piratical dis\nasters—oh, what would you do then\nwithout Christ in the ship? Take\nGod for your portion, God for your\nguide, God for your help; then all is\nwell; all is well for a time; all shall\nbe well forever. Blessed is that man\nwho puts in the Lord his trust. He\nshall never be confounded.\nBut my subject also impresses me\nwith the fact that when people start\nto follow Christ they must not expect\nsmooth sailing. These disciples got\ninto the small boats, and I have no\ndoubt they said: "What a beautiful\nday this is! How delightful is sailing\nin this boat! And as for the waves\nunder the keel of the boat, why, they\nonly make the motion of our little\nboat the more delightful." But when\nthe winds swept down and the sea\nwas tossed into wrath, then they\nfound that following Christ was not\nsmooth sailing. So you have found\nit; so I have found it.\nA young man in a store trying to\nserve God, while his employer scoffs\nat Christianity; the young men in the\nsame store, antagonistic to the Chris\ntian religion, teasing him, tormenting\nhim about his religion, trying to get\nhim mad. They succeed in getting\nhim mad and say: "You\'re a pretty\nChristian!" Does that yonng man\nfind it smooth sailing when he tries\nto follow Christ? Or you remember\na Christian girl. Her father despises\nthe Christian religion; her mother\ndespises the Christian religion; her\nbrothers and sisters scoff at the Chris\ntian religion; she can hardly find\nquiet place in which to say her\nprayers. Did she find it smooth sailing\nwhen she tried to follow Jesus Christ?\nOh, no! All who would live the life\nof the Christian religion must suffer\npersecution. If you do not find it in\none way, yon will get it in another\nway. But be not disheartened! Take\ncourage. You are in a glorious com\npanionship. God will see you through\nall trials, and He will deliver you.\nMy subject also impresses me with\nthe fact that good people sometimes\nget frightened. Iu the tones of these\ndisciples as they rushçd into the back\npart of the boat I find they are fright\nened almost to death. They say\n"Master, carest Thou not that we per\nish?" They had no reason to be\nfrightened, for Christ was in the boat.\nI suppose if we had been there we\nwould have been just as much af\nfrighted. Perhaps more. In all ages\nvery good people get very much af\nfrighted. It is often so in onr day,\nand men say: "Why, look at the bad\nlectures. Look at the various errors\ngoing over the church of God. We are\ngoing to founder. The church is go\nthan\nfact\ntury\nvery\nsaid:\nand\nget\nthe\nover\nof\nhe\nhis\nit\nger\nas\nis\nin\ngoing to founder. The church is go\ning to perish. She is going down."\nOh, how many good people are af\nfrighted by iniquity in our day and\nthink the church of Jesus Christ is\ngoing to be overthrown and are just\nas much affrighted as were the dis\nciples of my text! Don\'t wory, don\'t\nfret, as though iniquity were going to\ntriumph over righteousness. A lion\ngoes into a cavern to sleep. He lies\ndown with his shaggy mane covering\nthe paw3. Meanwhile the spiders spin\na web across the mouth of the cavern\nand say: "We have captured him.\'\nGossamer thread after gossamer\nthread until the whole front of the\ncavern is covered with the spider\'s\nweb, and the spiders say: "The lion\nis done; the lion is fast." After awhile\nthe lion has got through sleeping.\nHe ronses himself, he shakes his\nmane, he walks out into the sunlight.\nHe does not even know the spider\'s\nweb is spun, and with his roar he\nshakes the mountain. So men come\nspinning their sophistries and skepti\ncism about Jesus Christ. He seema to\nbo sleeping. They say: "We have\ncaptured the Lord. He will never\ncome forth again upon the nation.\nChrist is overcome forever. His re\nligion will never make any conquest\namong men." But after awhile the\nLion of the tribe of Judah will rouse\nHimself and come forth to shake\nmightily the nations. What\'a a spi\nder\'s web to the aroused lion? Give\ntruth and error a fair grapple, and\ntruth will come off victor.\nDo not be afraid of à great revival.\nOh, that such gales from Heaven might\nsweep through all onr churches! Oh,\nso\n______ _\nI f or c ôch day* as Richard Baxter saw In\nj Xngland and Robert McCheyne saw la\nDundee! Oh, for auch days as Jona\nthan Edwards saw in Northampton!\nhave often heard! my father tell of the\nfact that in the early part of the cen\ntury there broke out a revival at Som\nerville, N. J., and some people were ...\nvery much agitated about it. They\nsaid: "You are going to bring too\nmany people into the chureh at once,"\nand they sent down to NewB^nnswiekto\nget John Livingston to stop the revivaL\nWell, there was no better soul in all\nthe world than John Livingston. He\nwent and looked at the revival. They\nwanted him to stop it. He stoodin the\npulpit on the Lord\'s day and looked\nover the solemn auditory, and he said:\n"This, brethren, is in reality the work\nof God. Beware how you stop it." And\nhe was an old man, leaning heavily on\nhis staff—a very old man. And he\nlifted that staff and took hold of the\nsmall end of that staff and began to let\nit fall slowly through between the fin\nger and the thumb, and he said: "Oh,\nthou impenitent, thou art falling now\n—falling from life, falling away from\npeace and Heaven, falling as certainly\nas that cane is falling through my\nhand—falling certainly, though per\nhaps falling slowly!" And the eano\nkept on falling through John Living\nston\'s hand. The religions emotion in\nthe audience was overpowering, and\nmen saw a type of their doom as tho\ncane kept falling andi falling, until tho\nknob of the cane struck Mr. Living\nston\'s hand, and he clasped it stoutly\nand said: "But the grace of Godlcan\nstop yon as I stopped that eane," and\nthen there was gladness all through\nthe house at the fact of pardon and\npeace and salvation. "Well," said tho\npeople, after the service, "I guess yon\nhad better send Livingson home. Ho\nis making the revival worse." Oh, for\ngales from Heaven to sweep all the con\ntinents! The danger of the church of\nGod is not in revivals.\nAgain, my subject impressed mo\nwith the fact that Jesus was God and\nman in the same being. Here Ho ia\nin the back part of the boat. Oh, how\ntired He looks! What sad dreams Ho\nmust have! Look at His countenance;\nHe must be thinking of tho cross to\ncome. Look at Him; He ia a man\nbone of our bone, flesh of onr flesh.\nTired, He falls asleep; He is a man.\nBut then I find Christ at the prow of\nthe boat; I hear Him say: "Peace, ho\nstill," and I see the storm kneeling at\nHis feet and the tempests folding\ntheir wings in His presence; He is a\nGod. If I have sorrow and trouble\nand want sympathy, I go and kneel\ndown at the back part of the boat and\nsay: "O Christ, weary One of Gen\nnesaret, sympathize with all my sor\nrow! Man of Nazareth! Man of ths\nCross!" A Man, a Mant Bnt If X\nwant to conquer my spiritual foes, if\nI want to got tho victory over sin,\ndeath and hell, I come to the front of\nthe boat, and I kneel down, and I say:\n"O Lord Jesus Christ, Thon who didst\nhush the tempest, hush oil my grisf,\nhush all sin!"\nto\nOh,\nhush all my sin!"\nI learn once more from this subjeet\nthat Christ can huBh a tempest. It\ndid seem as if everything must go to\nruin. The disciples had given up tho\nidea of managing the ahip; the ërew\nwere entirely demoralized; yet Christ\nrises, and the storm crouches at His\nfeet. Oh, yes; Christ can hush tho\ntempest! Yon have had trouble. Per\nhaps it was tho little ohild taken\naway from yon—the sweetest child of\nthe household, the one who asked the\nmost carious questions and stood\naround yon with the greatest fond\nness, and the spade cut down through\nyour bleeding heart. Perhaps it was\nan only son, and your heart has ever\nsince been like a desolated castle ; the\nowls of the night hooting among the\nfallen arches and crumbling stair\nways. Or all your property swept\naway, yon said: "I had so much bank\nstock; I had so many government se\ncurities; I had so many houses; X had\nso many farms—all gone, all gone."\nWhy, air, all the storms that ever\ntrampled with their thnndera, all A*\nshipwrecks, have not been worse than\nthis to yon. Yet yon have not basa\ncompletely overthrown. Why? Christ\nsays: "I have that little one in my\nkeeping. I can care for him as well\nas you can, better than yon can, O be\nreaved mother!" Hushing the tem\npest. When your property went swey,\nGod said: "There are treasures la\nHeaven in banka that never break."\nJesus hushing the tempest.\nThere is one storm into whieh we\nwill all have to run. The moment\nwhen we let go of this world and toy\nto take hold of the next, we wiU want\nall the grace possible. Yonder I see\nIn\nla\na Christian soul rocking on the surgeag\nof death. All the powers of darknesjP\nseem let ont against that sont— U ma\nswirling wave, the thunder of the skyP\'\nthe shriek of the wind, all seem ia\nunite together. Bnt that soul Is Ubt\ntroubled. There is no sighing, there\nare no tears; plenty of tears In the\nroom at the departure, but he weepe\nno tears—calm, «atisfled and peace\nful; all is well. By the flash of the\nstorm yon see the harbor just ahead,\nand you are making for that harbor.\nAll shall be well, Jesus being our\npilot.\nInto the harbor of Heaven now we elide;\nWe\'re home at last, home at last.\nSoftly we drift on the bright, allv\'ry tldei\nWe\'re home at\'last\nGlory, to God, all ear dangers are e\'er;\nWe stand secure on the glorified shore t *\nGlory to God, we will about overman^\nWe\'re bane ut Isst.', 'II» fflssitt fanner.\nW.

Kerr stated that it was a\nsurprise to his associates and to\nhimself. He is confident, he said,\nthat the interests of the District\nwill be ably administered by his\nsuccessor, and asked for him the\nsame kindly treatment accorded\nhimself.\nMr. A. J.
