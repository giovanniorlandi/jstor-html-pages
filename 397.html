        <pre>['Asian Perspective 43 (2019), 721–736 \n© 2019 Institute for Far Eastern Studies, Kyungnam University\nCOMMENTARY\nEconomic Engagement with North Korea: \nMoving Beyond Kaesong\nBenjamin Katzeff Silberstein\nAt the present time, negotiAtions between the United States and North \nKorea remain stalled, as the summit in Hanoi ended with no agreement \nsigned between the parties. For proponents of economic engagement \nbetween North and South Korea, this is bleak news. The two Koreas are \neager to move on to concrete action, and, not least, economic exchange. \nAt the moment, discussions mainly center around four areas related to \neconomic matters: infrastructure, forestry, tourism, and, not least, reopening\nthe Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), closed by the South \nKorean Park Geun-hye administration in 2016 after North Korea’s rocket\ntest in early February that year (Yonhap News 2018b, 2018c, 2018d, \n2018e). Out of these, KIC is the largest in scale and most concrete flagship\nproject of inter-Korean cooperation. The KIC is an industrial park \nsitting at North Korea’s southern border, where—when it operated—\nSouth Korean firms employed North Korean labor in their factories. As \na special economic zone, it is an area where the laws and regulations \nof regular North Korean territory do not apply in full. Instead, a set of \nseparate regulations, designed to allow for different conditions of employment\nand capital ownership conditions, apply.1 It is both symboli-\ncally and practically important. In the first sense, marrying South Korean\ncapital with North Korean labor is a form of unification in its own \nright. In the second, too, it is economically rational. North Korea has an \nabundance of cheap labor, and South Korea has lots of capital to invest. \nThe Pyongyang Declaration, signed by South Korean president Moon \nJae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on September 19, 2018, \nstates that “the two sides” will “pursue substantial measures to further \nadvance exchanges and cooperation based on the spirit of mutual benefit \nand shared prosperity” (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Republic\nof Korea 2018, para. 2.2). With this promise in mind, reopening \nKaesong is a logical goal, at least in theory.\nThe problem, however, is that advocates of economic engagement \nwith North Korea motivate their policy and strategy with claims that go \nfar beyond economics. Proponents of such engagement rarely limit their \n', '722 Economic Engagement with North Korea: Moving Beyond Kaesong \narguments to what makes financial sense, but often make greater claims \nabout the impact that trade and investment in North Korea, through projects\nsuch as the KIC, can have for social and systemic change inside \nNorth Korea itself. In short, many regard the KIC as a crucial way of \nstarting the process of “greater unification” of North and South Korea, \nthrough one “small unification” (Kim 2015a, 5). Through a limited, special\neconomic zone (SEZ) such as the KIC, the capitalist form of pro-\nduction can be introduced in North Korea at a slow but steady pace, the \nidea goes, hopefully leading to broader reforms and institutional changes\nin its economic system. Another oft-cited rationale is that through \nhuman connections forged between North and South Korean workers \nand personnel, the otherwise closed-off North Korean population can \nlearn more about the living standards and social system of South Korea, \nand the outside world as a whole. As one author argued in 2017, for \nexample, through the KIC “steady interaction with South Koreans exposed\nthe North Korean people to the artifacts of southern wealth, which \nshook their faith in the communist system” (Park 2017).\nGiven its very model, however, it is questionable whether the KIC \ncan reach these goals. As the KIC is an SEZ, whatever institutional \nchange happens there, it is designed to be kept behind closed doors. I argue\nthat the KIC is unlikely to have the socially and economically trans-\nformative impact that its proponents wish to see. Much of the criticism \nagainst the KIC in recent years focuses on whether or not its proceeds \nhave gone toward financing North Korea’s weapons programs (Kim \n2016; Jack Kim 2017). A much more important question is whether the \ncomplex, the way it is set up, holds the potential to spur broader systemic\nchange in North Korea, as its advocates often claim. The zone’s first \nfew years in operation gave a solid indication of its limits and prospects \nas a project for sociopolitical change. The KIC was constructed to be \nsegregated from the rest of North Korea, and thus far, as the limited \nbut valuable data from testimonies reveal, the isolation seems to largely \nhave worked.\nThe focus on the KIC in discussions about inter-Korean economic \ncooperation, moreover, diverts attention from forms of exchange that \nhold a higher chance of success in spurring broader institutional change \nin North Korea. Economic governance in North Korea has changed significantly\nand rapidly over the past few years, particularly under Kim \nJong-un (Hong 2017). North Korea’s economic landscape has changed \ndrastically since the early 2000s, when the KIC was first constructed. \nToday, there exists in North Korea an entrepreneurial class that South \nKorean firms and other actors in economic cooperation with North Korea\nshould strive to engage. Such cooperation would still need to be fa-\n', 'Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein 723\ncilitated by the governments of North and South Korea, and start out on \na small scale. Nonetheless, connecting directly with North Korean businesspeople\nwithin actual North Korean society, rather than an enclave \nlike the KIC, is much more likely to lead to lasting linkages and direct \nlearning experiences within North Korean society. Under the banner \nof “our-style economic management” (Urisik kyŏngjegwallibangbŏp), \nmost North Korean firms are now allowed to plan their production process\nbasically however they see fit, and are no longer controlled by strict \nstate quotas or directives (Hong 2017, 61). By engaging directly with \nNorth Korean firms, South Korean firms could truly transfer knowledge \ndirectly to North Korean market actors.\nThe Economic and Political Rationale for Kaesong\nAccording to the vision, Kaesong is both a political and economic project.\nPolitically, the core idea is to further unification between North and \nSouth Korea by starting with a “small unification,” in the form of limited \neconomic engagement and exchange between North and South Korea. \nIn a bigger sense, economic engagement, and the KIC, is one building \nblock of the Sunshine Policy of Kim Dae-jung, South Korea’s president\nbetween 1998 and 2003.2 The Sunshine Policy of rapprochement \nand dialogue with North Korea aimed at building trust with the country \nthrough dialogue and exchange, not least between people, both civilians \nand public officials. In the words of one of its strongest advocates, and \na current advisor to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, the policy, \nin short, aims “at paving the way to peaceful coexistence and national \nunification through the dismantling of the cold-war structure that has \ndictated the geopolitical fate of the Korean peninsula since the end of \nthe Second World War” (Moon 2001, 178). The same author argued in \n2011 that the very existence of the KIC, in a militarily sensitive area of \nNorth Korea, spelled progress for inter-Korea relations. Because establishing\nthe KIC meant the North Korea military ceding partial control \nover territory in a militarily sensitive area, the fact that it was built at all \nconstitutes progress in inter-Korean relations, and a tangible example \nof how much North Korea is willing to give in its pursuit of economic \nprogress (Moon 2011, 10). Behind Kaesong lay the idea that through \nsustained economic exchange with South Korea, North Korea would \nbecome more comfortable with the idea of economic reform, and the \nprosperity this brought would eventually usher in political pluralism and \nlead to unification between the two Koreas in the long run (Cronin 2012, \n10).\n', '724 Economic Engagement with North Korea: Moving Beyond Kaesong \nIn a more general sense, advocates of economic engagement often\nassume that North Korea, if only given the right conditions, would \nwant to become part of the global economic community, and that its \ninstitutions would change in the process. As one advocate for economic \nengagement put it, “The more we trade with the North, and the more \nexposed North Korean citizens become to capitalism and Western ideas, \nthe harder it will be for the North Korean leadership to reverse the reforms”\n(Kang 2018, 126). Through the KIC as a tool for the aforemen-\ntioned economic engagement, the hope was, and remains, that lasting \nbonds can be forged between the two Koreas, through both tangible economic\nlinks and the continued interaction and human bonds formed be-\ntween workers and personnel from North and South Korea. The Mount \nKumgang Tourist Region—an area separated from North Korea’s Kangwon\nprovince and organized as a separate administrative region—was \nthe first of several planned inter-Korean projects of economic cooperation\nto come into form, and Kaesong was one of seven planned projects \nfor economic cooperation. The KIC went from visionary to concrete \nwith the signing of an agreement for its development in 2000 by representatives\nof North and South Korea (Im and Yi 2015, 9–10).\nKaesong and other projects of economic exchange, however, were \nnot just political in nature. Its advocates, to stress the viability and mutual\nbenefits of the KIC, often argue that the project generates strong \neconomic benefits and mutual gains for both North and South Korea. \nSeen from the perspective of strict economic theory, the two Koreas \ncan combine their respective comparative advantages through the zone. \nThe Hecksher-Ohlin theorem teaches us that a country relatively abundant\nin capital will export goods that use its abundant factors more in-\ntensely in production, and import goods that require its relatively scarce \nfactors for manufacturing. North Korea is relatively abundant in labor \ncompared with South Korea—that is, labor is comparatively cheap in \nNorth Korea. South Korea, on the other hand, is abundant in capital. \nConsequently, from the standpoint of economic theory, it makes sense \nfor the two countries to enable South Korean firms to establish factories \nand manufacturing with North Korean labor as the workforce. Indeed, \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises of South Korea were particularly \nstrong advocates and drivers of the project, for long having had a hard \ntime recruiting labor at a cost they could afford (Kim 2015b, 49). While \nthe KIC ended up being strongly subsidized and supported by South Korean\ngovernment funds, the original intention and plan was for it to be a \ncivilian, private-sector endeavor (Im and Yi 2015, 11). By its closure in \n2016, it had realized only a fraction of its originally planned scale: only \n', 'Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein 725\n5 percent of the land planned for development in the longer run actually \nwas developed and used for the zone (Im and Yi 2015, 3). One of the \nmain problems the zone faced was that the North Korean side could \nnot, under the conditions that prevailed, meet the South Korean firms’ \ndemand for labor in the zone’s factories.\nThe final motivation for the KIC lies in the intersection between \npolitical and economic motivations. By introducing the capitalist mode \nof production and market mechanisms into North Korea, advocates of \nthe KIC hope to influence North Korean society and, in the long run, \nto inspire North Korea to market reforms and liberalization. The South \nKorean snack Choco Pie has become an oft-used symbol for the Trojanhorse-like\nconception of Kaesong, since North Korean workers received \nbetween two and eight of them as snacks during every working day \nand subsequently began selling them on markets in North Korea. As \nKim Byŏng-no has noted, Choco Pies took on the same symbolism for \nthe spread of capitalism in the North as Coca-Cola once held for the \nAmerican capitalist system (Chŏng and Kim 2015, 312). One proponent \nof the KIC even went as far as to claim that “as North Koreans peeled \noff wrappers printed in Korean script and bit into the delicious treats, \nthey ingested the irrefutable evidence that the ideological race between \nthe two Koreas was over, and the North had lost.”3 The same author, \nmoreover, claimed a link between an increase in defections from North \nto South Korea that year and the Choco Pies handed out to workers \nat Kaesong. Through KIC, many hope the North Korean regime and \npeople will be exposed to the efficacy of capitalism, while becoming \nincreasingly comfortable with the system, realizing it can be combined \nwith its own system (Manyin and Nanto 2011, 17). In the longer run, \ntherefore, the KIC can prepare for unification not just by making North \nKorea wealthier and closing some of the wide economic gap between \nthe two Koreas. It could also, its advocates hope, make unification a \nsmoother process by bringing the two Koreas’ systems closer together,\nand making North Korea’s economic institutions more modern and \nmarket based.\nThe Logic of Special Economic Zones\nIn theory, an SEZ such as Kaesong could achieve many of these objectives.4\nSEZs typically aim to attract foreign investors by offering incen-\ntives such as lower taxes and tariffs, and an overall liberalized business \nclimate. When they function as intended, they spread their knowledge \n', '726 Economic Engagement with North Korea: Moving Beyond Kaesong \nand technology to domestic firms, and increase overall quality by upping\ncompetition, generating positive, long-run effects on the economy \nas a whole. Through their learning experience, domestic firms can become\nexporters and compete on the global market. Far from all SEZs are \nsuccessful, and the ones that are tend to have a number of characteristics \nin common. According to Moberg (2015), such SEZs tend to have links \nto the domestic market, so that investors can source not only labor, but \ngoods used in production, from sellers in the country. They also tend to \nbe located near urban areas and national borders, and be in countries \nwith a solid supply of skilled labor. SEZs can also have positive impacts \non the institutional environment of the host country by fostering competition\nbetween local governments to provide the most favorable business \nclimate. SEZs can also create growth and employment opportunities in \ntheir host country by increasing demand for production factors. Governments\ncan institute SEZs for a wide variety of reasons. SEZs can \nserve as experimental projects for governments to test out policy effects \nbefore implementing them on a national scale, or confine policy changes \nto a specific area that cannot be passed as nationwide government policy \ndue to resistance from special interest groups or bureaucratic inertia.\nWhen have SEZs been successful? The perhaps most famous case \nof SEZs propelling larger-scale, national growth is that of China. From \nthe very inception of SEZs as a phenomenon in the country, they were \ndriven by a desire from the government’s side to experiment with institutional\nreform. The SEZs were testing grounds for changes that the \ngovernment hoped to roll out on a national, more extensive scale. As \none observer notes, “Deng wanted to use these earliest localities that \nwere opened up to become experimental zones where measures for attracting\nforeign direct investment would be tried out and foreign capital, \ntechnology and know-how put to good use.”5 China’s SEZ program was \ninitially heavily centralized, with local governments having relatively \nlittle say in the design of institutional frameworks. In the 1970s, when \nSEZs were first launched, their revenues were barely enough to compensate\nfor infrastructure costs. They began generating serious levels of \nrevenue only when, in the early 1980s, the government began allowing \nfor more local, decentralized decisionmaking by zone administrations. \nThe country’s first SEZ, in Shekou, near Hong Kong, was set up after\nlocal business interests wanting to increase trade with Hong Kong \nlobbied politicians for a zone (Katzeff Silberstein 2018b). That is, the \nauthorities of Guangdong province (where Shekou is located), together \nwith the Ministry of Communications, put forth a proposition to the \nState Council of China to invest in specific sectors relevant to the region \n', 'Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein 727\nnear the border with Hong Kong (Lai 2006, 73). It was a development \ndriven primarily from the locality itself, rather than the central government.\nSupport from Deng Xiaoping personally, of course, was crucial \nfor SEZs such as the one in Shekou to take off, but it is crucial that the \noriginal push came from below rather than above (Moberg 2015, 182). \nWhen SEZs have been successful and viable, the initiative and original \npressure have come from the bottom rather than the top. As they saw \nthe financial success from the zones, Communist Party officials took the \npolicy lessons learned on the local level and implemented many of them \non a nationwide scale.\nThe Case of Kaesong\nFew of the dynamics described above, which made several Chinese SEZs \nsuccess stories, can be discerned in Kaesong. Notably, this is somewhat \ndifferent for some of North Korea’s other SEZs. For example, local actors\ntook the initiative for the Waudo Export Processing Zone in Nam-\npo, on North Korea’s west coast, according to one analyst with direct \ninsights into the country’s SEZ environment (Abrahamian 2014, 19). \nNonetheless, the very institutional design of the KIC specifically makes \nit difficult to see how it could realize the benefits that other SEZs have \nglobally. It is designed to keep change contained within a well-defined \ngeographic and institutional space. To be sure, the KIC is not without its \npotential economic benefits. Many South Korean firms have pushed for \nthe zone to reopen, and see real benefits and opportunities in investing. \nThe comparatively low wage costs in Kaesong appeal to South Korean \nbusinesses, as do the comparatively low barriers of language and culture \n(Park 2019). At the core, the idea of the KIC is about economic gains. In \npractice, however, matters quickly turned out to be complicated.\nThe zone was started as a private, civilian endeavor under the Hyundai-Asan\nconglomerate. Problems in raising enough funds, however, \nmade it necessary for the government to pitch in significant amounts \nof investment money into the zone. Hyundai partnered with the Korea \nLand and Housing Corporation, and in total 44 percent of investment \nfunds for Kaesong came from government and public enterprises (Im \nand Yi 2015, 11). When the KIC was closed by the South Korean government\nin 2016, firms ended up with losses totaling $1.3 billion (Yoon-\nmi Kim 2017).\nFrom the start, the North Korean government ensured that the KIC, \nand other projects of economic exchange, remained contained within \n', '728 Economic Engagement with North Korea: Moving Beyond Kaesong \nspecific areas, both geographically and socially. If other SEZs in the \nworld have had a level of autonomy from the government, Kaesong, it \nseems, lay under stronger government control than most of the North \nKorean economy. Positioned in a militarily sensitive area, Kaesong was \nnever politically uncontroversial even within North Korea: the Korean \nPeople’s Army allegedly resisted orders to pull back their previous positions\nin the area farther inland, to make room for the KIC (Kim 2015b, \n35). Nevertheless, fully controlled by a state-appointed organ in charge \nof all economic cooperation with South Korea, the KIC remains under \nthe firm guidance of the central government in Pyongyang (Kim 2015b, \n52–53). The institutional gains that other SEZs have reached by spurring \ncompetition between local governments, and the like, therefore seem \nunlikely for the KIC, unless its administrative structure were to change \nin the future. This is hardly surprising, particularly given the sensitive, \npolitical nature of the KIC and the zone’s precarious geographic location.\nBut one might ask whether an SEZ, under such conditions, even \nthough it can be seen as progress in its own right, is really the best way \ntoward the gains that advocates of economic engagement claim.\nWhat about diffusion of knowledge, and learning through people-to-people\nexchanges and meetings? In this regard, too, advocates \nof the KIC have rarely presented strong, empirical evidence that the \nzone has had such effects. North Korean authorities retain full control \nover the workers they dispatch to the zone. By design, North Korean \nworkers are not to interact with South Korean staff in the zone (Kim \n2015b, 50). One of the main problems for the South Korean firms operating\nin the zone was that the North Korean side simply could not \nmeet a firm’s demand for increasing the labor force. Between 2008 and \n2015, the number of workers in KIC increased from 38,931 to 54,998 \n(Im and Yi 2011, 55–56). Still, these numbers were much lower than \nwhat the firms asked for. The North Korean side set up highly specific \nconditions for the pool of potential workers that the firms could request \nfrom and would not share even basic demographic information about \nthe residents of the geographic area from which the firms would be able \nto request workers. Because authorities had to be able to bus workers in, \nthey could be drawn only from a very specific region in close proximity \nto the zone. In all likelihood, given the age group that workers could \ncome from, the number employed in the KIC at the time it shut down \nwas very close to the maximum number possible given North Korea’s \nconditions. South Korean firms offered to build dormitories for workers,\nbut the North Korean authorities refused to let their citizens live in \nquarters not entirely controlled by the state, where they would not be \n', 'Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein 729\nable to exercise the same sort of surveillance routines that they would \ninside regular North Korean territory (Im and Yi 2011, 74). For contrast, \nconsider the extensive freedom granted to one of the first governing \nofficials of the Shenzhen zone in China, Liang Xiang, who in the late \n1970s and early 1980s sent head hunters around China to recruit competent\nqualified professionals and laborers. In 1979, the zone had only \ntwo qualified engineers, but four years later the figure had increased to \n732 (Lai 2006, 81).\nThere is limited firsthand information on the extent to which the \nKIC exposed North Koreans, whether at the park or broadly in society, \nto South Korea’s wealth and culture. One interview study by South Korean\nscholars Chŏng Gŭn-sik and Kim Yun-ae sheds interesting light on \nthe sociocultural impacts of the KIC on Kaesong as a whole (Chŏng and \nYun 2015). Because of its location in the southern end of the country, \nclose to the thirty-eighth parallel, Kaesong as a city is already under \nmore strict surveillance than many other parts of the country. In the \n1970s and 1980s, the regime moved citizens whose family background \nwas deemed untrustworthy away from the strategically crucial area \n(Chŏng and Yun 2015, 322). While this means that Kaesong as a region \nmay be one the regime feels it already has relatively good control over, \nit also speaks to how sensitive the KIC’s location is. The very construction\nof the KIC exposed people to the wealth of South Korea. The sheer \nsize of South Korean trucks and the speed at which they were able to \nconstruct modern buildings in the KIC made an impression on some \nresidents (Chŏng and Yun 2015, 326). South Korean products such as \nChoco Pie snacks did make their way to North Korean marketplaces, in \nsignificant amounts, and North Koreans smuggling such products could \nmake large amounts of money (Chŏng and Yun 2015, 334, 338). The \nquality of South Korean products, and those manufactured at the KIC, \nmade a clear impression on many North Korean consumers (Chŏng and \nYun 2015, 341–342). Even the quality of South Korean waste products, \nsuch as used cartons and boxes, made a strong impression among some \nNorth Koreans (Chŏng and Yun 2015, 347). At the same time, the North \nKorean authorities kept workers at the KIC under very strong surveillance,\nand if people were even seen speaking with South Koreans in an \nunauthorized way, the authorities would take action (Chŏng and Yun \n2015, 348). The fact that surveillance cameras were used in the KIC by \nNorth Korean authorities, still a relatively rare sight in the rest of the \ncountry at the time of the KIC’s initial operations, speaks to how much \nstronger surveillance and control were in the zone compared with the \nrest of the country. Even making small talk with a South Korean with-\n', '730 Economic Engagement with North Korea: Moving Beyond Kaesong \nout the presence of a North Korean witness would result in the person \nin question being interrogated (Chŏng and Yun 2015, 349). The possibility\nof information about South Korea spreading in North Korean \nsociety made the authorities compensate with generally higher levels of \ncontrol and ideological propaganda education. Thae Yong-ho, a former \nhigh-level official at North Korea’s embassy in London, has explained \nthat through times of increased diplomatic engagement with the outside\nworld, and with the increased risk that outside information might \nseep into the country, the surveillance apparatus goes into overdrive (Ha \n2018). As will be further explored below, North Korean leaders have \nbeen relatively explicit in their attitude toward foreign investment and \nhave called for stronger ideological defense and control to counter what \npossible foreign influences could leak in as a result of increased economic\nexchange with the outside world. Naturally, not all influences \nand impressions from South Korea could be contained. The extent of the \nimpressions spread, and how much it mattered cannot be quantified or \nfully evaluated. Given the rigor of North Korean control, however, it is \ndifficult to regard the KIC as a project of people-to-people contact and \nexchange in any meaningful way.\nTo understand the North Korean attitude toward foreign economic \ninvestments, one speech that its founding leader, Kim Il-sung, made in \n1989 is particularly worth studying. Speeches and other works by Kim \nIl-sung remain foundational for ideological writings in North Korea, \nand the reality of SEZs in general, and of the KIC, mirrors well what \nKim Il-sung envisioned. In the speech, given to members of the Central \nCommittee of the Korean Workers’ Party, Kim emphasized the need for \nhigher-quality consumer goods for the people (Kim 1996). He stated \nthat the “imperialists” were “slandering” North Korea for its refusal to \n“follow an open-door policy,” but, according to Kim, North Korea was \nnot keeping its doors shut entirely (Kim 1996, 22). Kim claimed that \nNorth Korea happily collaborates with foreign countries on “technical \ncooperation” and “joint ventures,” for example, but for a country to \nopen its doors completely is not a good thing: “Indiscriminate opening \nis not good. Careless opening may allow mosquitos and blowflies to fly \nin and cause damage. We [North Korea] must conduct exchanges and \njoint ventures with other countries, but we must pitch mosquito nets to \nprevent those insects from infiltrating” (Kim 1996, 22).\nAlthough given long ago, the speech goes a long way to explain \nNorth Korean attitudes to foreign economic exchange. It is not necessarily\na bad thing, but any economic cooperation with other countries must \nbe accompanied by careful safeguards to ensure that foreign ideological \n', 'Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein 731\ninfluences do not penetrate the country to any significant extent. North \nKorea, more than many other countries, is firmly grounded in its own \nhistory. Though Kim Jong-un has enacted a long range of changes in \neconomic policy, the blockade on outside information remains steadfast \nand even appears to be increasing at the time of writing, in parallel with \ndiplomatic engagement with the United States and South Korea (Katzeff \nSilberstein 2018a). Thus, looking ahead, while management practices \nmay become freer in Kaesong if the zone reopens—South Korean firms \nmay, perhaps, be able to pay North Korean workers directly—controls \non people’s movement and the strict separation of North Korean workers \nand South Korean management are unlikely to change. This has been a \nNorth Korean hard line from the beginning of the regime’s SEZ interest, \nand as the record with the KIC shows, North Korean flexibility around \nSEZ management has usually been limited. A mosquito net is certainly \nnot a wall, but nonetheless it is meant as a strong barrier of separation.\nThe KIC does not exist in a vacuum. The main focus of this article is \nhow the zone fits into the broader context of the economic engagement \nstrategy of South Korea (and to some extent the United States). To understand\nwhy the KIC is a problematic tool for economic engagement, \nhowever, one must also see how the zone fits into North Korea’s broader \neconomic policy framework. Under Kim Jong-un, a flurry of SEZs have \nbeen set up, with varied degrees of ambition and progress (Abrahamian \n2014). Overall progress has been slow. After all, most of these SEZs are \npredicated upon foreign investments or tourism, which cannot happen \nas long as sanctions remain unchanged. Nonetheless, Kim has continued \nto take an interest in developing the country’s SEZs. In the summer of \n2018, for example, he visited a reed farm in Sindo, the same county as \nHwanggumpyong, an island that China and North Korea agreed in 2012 \nto develop into an SEZ (Yonhap News 2018a). Under Kim, several new \nlaws on SEZs have been enacted, to make foreign investments more \nfeasible. Much in these legal changes gives cause for hope for those \nwho want to see increased economic engagement by foreigners in North \nKorea. For example, one legal revision adopted in late 2014 lets foreigners\nhold high-level positions with decisionmaking power in the man-\nagement organs of SEZs (Institute for Far Eastern Studies 2014). The \nNorth Korean English-language newspaper Pyongyang Times carried an \narticle in 2013 on legal changes pertaining to “economic development \nzones,” with the headline “New Law Friendly towards Investment”6—\nclearly, the North Korean government is eager to project the image that \nthey are open to foreign business. Outside of Kaesong until it shut down, \nthe Rason SEZ is the zone that has seen the most progress and activity \n', '732 Economic Engagement with North Korea: Moving Beyond Kaesong \nthrough the past few years. One seasoned expert of the North Korean \neconomy who visited the zone in 2014 called it “mind-boggling”:7 there, \nhe could mix with the North Korean locals (albeit in limited settings), \nand the official currency exchange rates in the zone were the true market \nrates, which in other parts of the country would have been known as \n“black market” rates.\nEven so, to date we have had very few indications to suggest that the \nregime regards SEZs as anything but channels to earn foreign currency \nrevenue without having to change the economic governance of society \nin a broader sense. For all the attention Kim Jong-un has given SEZs, \nthe present author is unaware of any time at which Kim has even hinted \nthat whatever rules and behavior exist in the zones could be exported \nbeyond them. Rason may be the site of remarkable institutional change \nand relaxation in a North Korean context, but there is little to suggest \nthat the regime will be unable to keep it in check, within a limited area \nonly. North Korean publications rarely spell out the regime’s long-term \nvisions for SEZs, but whatever few indications we can glean from official\npublications suggest that the main goal is to seek investments in \nrelatively limited areas, and only on the government’s conditions. As the \n2013 regulations put it, “Investment and economic activities are limited \nonly to those who give knowledge to and promote the nation’s safety,\nthe health of the people, a wholesome, socially moral lifestyle and \nenvironmental protection, and are prohibited to those who are lagging \nbehind in terms of economic technology.”8\nNone of this is to say that foreign investments in North Korea can \nnever happen and be beneficial both for the country and for the investors \nin question. It does mean, however, that the transformational potential \nof SEZs in general, and the KIC specifically, is limited. Ironically, because\nof the KIC’s high political profile, it is even less likely than other \nSEZs to reach the broader social impacts that advocates of economic \nengagement with North Korea wish to see. Territorial control has been \nfundamental to the North Korean regime for its entire period of existence.\nAs Kim Jong-il stated in 1984, “National territory is a material \nbase on which political regime is constructed and national sovereignty \nis exercised. The country’s independence is asserted on territory and it \nis firmly secured by territory.”9 For the North Korean regime, territorial \ncontrol has always come before economic interest. This is unlikely to \nchange within the foreseeable future.\n', 'Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein 733\nConclusion: The Alternatives\nGiven these conditions, it is unclear how the positive effects of the KIC \nthat other SEZs have seen could feasibly come about. By design, the \nzone is meant and intended to be separate from the rest of North Korea.\nThe regime has held on tight to the tools at its disposal to contain \nthe zone and ensure that it remains a territory fully apart from the rest \nof North Korea. Advocates of economic engagement would do well to \nconsider other possibilities in working with North Korea to promote \npositive, sustainable institutional change. Training programs for North \nKorean entrepreneurs, for example, such as the ones conducted by the \nSingaporean NGO Choson Exchange, could be a model to spread knowhow\nand market-based thinking on economic policy and practice within \nNorth Korean society. South Korea could also set up an intermediary \nbureau, for example, to facilitate and assist investments by South Korean\nfirms in North Korea. This would increase the likelihood that lessons \nfrom involvement with South Korean firms—and perhaps, those from \nother countries—get diffused and take hold within North Korean society \nmore broadly. Finally, to increase the prospects for institutional competition\nand diversity in management methods and policies, South Ko-\nrea and other parties engaging with the North Korean economy should \nconsider working with SEZs other than only the KIC. If engagement \ndoes end up leading to foreign investments in SEZs, it is important that \nit be concentrated not just to one specific SEZ. Geographic spread is \nimportant to ensure that not only one specific region of North Korea \ngets to reap the potential benefits. Economic engagement that penetrates \ndeeper into North Korean society beyond Kaesong seems impossible, \ngiven the ideology of the North Korean regime. This assumption, however,\nis much too defeatist. The vast changes in economic management \nunder Kim Jong-un, however, suggest a wholly new attitude to entrepreneurship\nand private economic activity under the current government. \nThis should be exploited by those who favor economic engagement with \nNorth Korea, and a new, creative approach is necessary.\nNotes\nBenjamin Katzeff Silberstein is Templeton Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research \nInstitute, focusing primarily on the Korean Peninsula and East Asian region.
