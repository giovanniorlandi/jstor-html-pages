Indoreonectes evezardi has been suggested as a species complex based on \nrecent genetic studies; however, due to lack of type material the species delimitation has been difficult. Here we redescribe I. evezardi \ncollected from its type locality and describe two new species from the northern Western Ghats of India. Indoreonectes neeleshi, \ndescribed from Mula River tributary of Godavari river system, can be diagnosed from all its congeners based on a combination of \ncharacters: inner rostral barbel reaching middle of nostril; maxillary barbel reaching midway between eye and posterior border of \noperculum; dorsal hump behind nape; bars on lateral side of the body wider than inter-bar space; total vertebrae 35 and dorsal fin \ninsertion between 13th and 14th abdominal vertebrae. Indoreonectes rajeevi, described from Hiranyakeshi River of the Krishna river \nsystem, differs from all its congeners based on a combination of characters: inner rostral barbel reaching anterior margin of eye; \nmaxillary barbel reaching posterior border of operculum; conspicuous black markings on lower lip, dorsal hump absent; total vertebrae\n36 and dorsal fin insertion between 12th and 13th abdominal vertebrae. Further, I. neeleshi differs from its congeners by the raw \ngenetic distance of 6.8–14.4% for the cox1 gene and 5.7–16.2% for the cytb gene, while I. rajeevi differs from its congeners by the \nraw genetic distance of 10.9–14.0% for the cox1 gene and 11.8–15.8% for the cytb gene.\nKeywords\nBiodiversity hotspot, Godavari river system, Krishna river system, Maharashtra\nIntroduction\nThe genus Indoreonectes Rita, Bănărescu and Nalbant \nof hill stream loaches (Cypriniformes: Nemacheilidae) \nwas initially proposed as a subgenus of Oreonectes Günther,\nwhile describing O. (Indoreonectes) keralensis Rita \nand Nalbant (Rita et al. 1978). Kottelat (1990a, 1990b, \n2012) and Prokofiev (2010) considered Indoreonectes as \na valid genus endemic to Peninsular India. The genus is \ndiagnosed based on following combination of characters \nVertebrate Zoology 71, 2021, 517–533 | DOI 10.3897/vz.71.e62814\nCopyright Pradeep Kumkar et al.

(1978) and, Bănărescu and Nalbant \n(1995): nostrils close to each other, posterior one distant \nfrom eye; lateral line present, short; length of nasal barbels\nvariable; free posterior part of air bladder rudimenta-\nry; bars on side of body. Currently, the genus is represented\nby three species, I. evezardi (Day, 1872), I. keralensis \n(Rita and Nalbant, 1978) and I. telanganaensis (Prasad, \nSrinivasulu, Srinivasulu, Anoop and Dahanukar, 2020). \nIndoreonectes evezardi has been considered to be a \nwidely distributed species in peninsular India north of \nthe Palghat Gap, occurring in the east-flowing Krishna, \nGodavari and Cauvery river systems in addition to several\nwest-flowing rivers in Goa, Maharashtra, and Gujarat \nstates, while I. keralensis is restricted to river systems \nsouth of the Palghat gap, particularly the Periyar, Pampa, \nMuvattupuzha, and Meenachil rivers of Western Ghats of \nKerala (Rita et al. 1978; Menon 1987; Kottelat 1990b; \nRema Devi et al. 2002, 2013; Dahanukar et al. 2004; \nKazi et al. 2018; Raghavan and Ali 2011). The recently \ndescribed species I. telanganaensis is currently known \nonly from its type locality, a seasonal stream of the Godavari\nRiver within the Kawal Tiger Reserve, Mancheriyal \nDistrict, Telangana State (Prasad et al. 2020).\nBased on extensive genetic sampling from the northern\nWestern Ghats, Keskar et al. (2018) suggested that \nthe wide-ranging taxon Indoreonectes evezardi is a species\ncomplex with several undescribed species. Howev-\ner, lack of type material for I. evezardi (see for detailed \ndiscussion, Prasad et al. 2020: 344) has made it difficult \nto diagnose species in the I. evezardi complex. Although \nPrasad et al. (2020) recognized this issue and provided \nphotographs of I. evezardi from its type locality, they did \nnot redescribe the species in detail. \nIn the current study we redescribe Indoreonectes \nevezardi from its type locality using fresh collections and \nspecimens studied by Prasad et al. (2020). Further, we describe\ntwo new species from the I. evezardi complex from \nthe Mula River, a tributary of the Godavari river system \nand from the Hiranyakeshi River, part of the Krishna river\nsystem. \nMaterials and methods\nFish collection\nIndividuals of the new species of Indoreonectes were \ncollected from two different localities, one in the upper \nreaches of Godavari river system in Maharashtra at Harishchandragad\n(19°23.64′N; 73°46.74′E, ca 1180 m a.s.l.) \nFigure 1. Type localities of species of the genus Indoreonectes in southern Peninsular India.\n', 'Vertebrate Zoology 71, 2021, 517–533 519\n(ten individuals) and another from Krishna river system in \nMaharashtra at Amboli (15°58.02′N; 74°0.66′E, ca 692 m \na.s.l.) (twelve individuals) (Fig. 1). Three topotypes of \nIndoreonectes evezardi were collected from Mutha River \nat Kuran (18°23.28′N; 73°38.52′E, ca 580 m a.s.l.) Pune, \nMaharashtra, and one topotype of Indoreonectes keralensis\nwas collected from Santhampara, Idukki, (9°58.08′N; \n77°12.72′E, ca 1050 m a.s.l.), Kerala. After anesthetization\none individual each of the new species was stored \nin absolute alcohol and the remaining in 10% formalin. \nCollected specimens are housed in the museum of the \nBombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Mumbai, Maharashtra,\nIndia (I. evezardi – BNHS FWF 1068–1070, \nI. neeleshi – BNHS FWF 1071–1080, I. rajeevi – BNHS \nFWF 1081–1092) and in the collection of the Kerala University\nof Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), Kochi, \nIndia (I. keralensis – KUFOS.2017.11.217). Additional \nspecimens were studied from the museum collection of \nBNHS and the Wildlife Information Liaison Development\nSociety (WILD), Coimbatore, India. \nMorphology, morphometry and \nosteology\nMeasurements were taken for each specimen to the nearest\n0.1 mm using digital callipers (Mitutoyo, Japan). Mor-\nphometric methods follow Keskar et al. (2015). Subunits \nof the body are presented as a percent of standard length \n(SL), and subunits of the head as a percent of head length \n(HL). Fin rays were counted using a stereomicroscope \n(Magnus, India). Frequency of the count is provided in \nparentheses after the count. The last two fin rays of the \ndorsal and anal fins, which articulate with a single pterygiophore\nand often referred to as “last ray split to the \nbase” were counted as one ray. Terminology used for describing\nthe pattern of bars and other markings is defined \nin Figure 2. Reach of barbels is based on the condition \nwhen folded back artificially.\nTwo paratypes of I. neeleshi (BNHS FWF 1074–\n75), three paratypes of I. rajeevi (BNHS FWF 1090–\n92), two specimens of topotypic I. evezardi (BNHS \nFWF 1068–1069) and one specimen of I. keralensis \n (KUFOS.2017.11.217) were cleared and stained to study \nskeletal morphology following the procedure described \nby Potthoff (1984) and used to obtain vertebral counts, \nincluding Weberian apparatus (counted as four vertebrae) \nand compound centrum.\nMolecular analysis\nGill tissues were extracted from a paratype of each species\npreserved in absolute alcohol (Indoreonectes nee-\nleshi – BNHS FWF 1080 and I. rajeevi – BNHS FWF \n1089). DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit \n(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the protocol given \nby the manufacturer. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase \nsubunit I (cox1) gene was amplified using Polymerase \nChain Reaction with primers FishF1 and FishR1 (Ward et \nal. 2005). Gene amplification, purification and sequencing \nprotocols follow Ali et al. (2013). Sequencing was performed\nby Apical Scientific SDN, BHD., Malaysia. The \nraw chromatograms were manually assembled and verified\nfor potential mistakes using free software FinchTV \n1.4.0 (Geospiza, Inc.; Seattle, WA, USA; http://www.\ngeospiza.com). The BLAST tool (Altschul et al. 1990) \nwas used to see the similarity to the listed sequences in \nFigure 2. Diagram of colour markings in Indoreonectes and their terminology.\n', 'Pradeep Kumkar et al.: Two new species of the hillstream loach genus Indoreonectes520\nthe database of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). \nGene sequences are deposited in GenBank with the accession\nnumber MW136273 and MW136274. Additional \nsequences, for cox1 and cytochrome b (cytb) genes from \nour earlier studies Keskar et al. (2018) and Kumkar et al. \n(2016) and cytb gene from Prasad et al. (2020), were retrieved\nfrom NCBI GenBank database (Appendix I).\nGene sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar \n2004) for individual genes and the aligned sequences \nwere concatenated to get the combined data matrix of \ncox1 and cytb. The combined matrix had 1747 base pairs. \nBalitora chipkali (Cypriniformes: Balitoridae) was used \nas an outgroup. Data were partitioned in two genes and \ntheir respective codon positions to create a full partition. \nThe best partitioning scheme and the nucleotide substitution\nmodel for the partition scheme were estimated us-\ning partition analysis (Chernomor et al. 2016) and ModelFinder\n(Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017) implemented in \nIQ-TREE 1.6.12 (Nguyen et al. 2015). Maximum likelihood\n(ML) analysis was performed in IQ-TREE 1.6.12 \n(Nguyen et al. 2015) with the best partition scheme and \nultrafast bootstrap support for 1000 iterations (Hoang et \nal. 2018). The resulting maximum likelihood phylogram \nwas edited in FigTree v1.4.4 (Rambaut 2018). Uncorrected\nraw (p) distances between pairs of sequences were \ncalculated in MEGA X 10.1 (Kumar et al. 2018).\nResults\nTaxonomy\nIndoreonectes evezardi (Day, 1872)\nFigs 3–6\nNemacheilus evezardi Day, 1872: p. 182\nOreonectes (Indoreonectes) evezardi (Day, 1872): Rita, Bănărescu and \nNalbant (1978, 186)\nMaterial examined.

Indoreonectes rajeevi\n– Nasal barbel shorter, reaching middle of eye; maxillary barbel short, reaching midway between eye and posterior \nborder of operculum; inner rostral barbel short, reaching middle of nostril; conspicuous black marking on lower \nlip absent; distinct dorsal hump behind nape ............................................................................................................3\n3 Lateral bars wider than inter-bar spaces ................................................................................Indoreonectes neeleshi\n– Lateral bars narrower than inter-bar spaces ..............................................................................................................4\n4 Caudal peduncle as long as deep; caudal-peduncle bar not divided into two spots; spots on cheeks below eye ....... \n ....................................................................................................................................Indoreonectes telanganaensis\n– Caudal peduncle deeper than long; caudal-peduncle bar expressed as two separate spots; no spots on cheeks below \neye .........................................................................................................................................Indoreonectes evezardi\nMolecular analysis\nThe best partitioning scheme and nucleotide substitution \nmodel for the partition scheme for concatenated sequences\nwas identified as TN+F+I for combined partition of \nfirst two codon positions of cox1 and cytb genes (BIC = \n10659.524), HKY+F for third codon position of cox1 \n(BIC = 2158.262) and TN+F+I for third codon position of \ncytb (BIC = 3651.901). In the maximum likelihood tree \nall the species formed reciprocally monophyletic groups \n(Fig. 9). Genetically, I. neeleshi showed a sister group \nrelationship with I. telanganaensis, while I. rajeevi was \nrecovered as the sister group to the clade containing I. \nevezardi, I. neeleshi and I. telanganaensis. Indoreonectes \nneeleshi differs from all its congeners, for which genetic \ndata are available, by a raw genetic distance of 6.8% and \nabove for cox1 gene (Table 2) and 5.7% and above for \ncytb gene (Table 3). In particular, I. neeleshi differs from \nits sister taxon I. telanganaensis by a raw genetic distance \nof 6.5–6.7 % in the cytb gene (Table 3). Indoreonectes rajeevi\ndiffers from all its congeners, for which genetic data \nare available, with a raw genetic distance of 10.9% and \nabove for the cox1 gene (Table 2) and 11.8% and above \nfor the cytb gene (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nKeskar et al. (2018: fig. 3) delineated 13 clades of Indoreonectes\nfrom northern Western Ghats of India based \non multiple molecular methods. Of these, clade 4 containing\nspecimens from Harishchandragad and clade 13 \ncontaining specimens from Amboli are described in the \ncurrent study as I. neeleshi and I. rajeevi, respectively. \nBoth, clades 4 and 13, are distinct from clade 3, which \ncontained topotypic I. evezardi, in all the molecular delimitation\nmethods used by Keskar et al. (2018). How-\never, it is important to note that clades 11, 12 and 13 in \nKeskar et al. (2018) were not distinct in one of the four \ngenetic species delimitation methods and contained specimens\nfrom adjacent areas, namely Gaibi, Mahabalesh-\nwar, Patan, Medha, and Kumbharli (see Keskar et al. \n', 'Pradeep Kumkar et al.: Two new species of the hillstream loach genus Indoreonectes530\n2018 for locality details), suggesting that I. rajeevi could \nbe distributed in areas other than its type locality. However,\nfurther taxonomic sampling is necessary to test this \nhypothesis.\nGenetically, the new species are quite distinct from \ntheir congeners. Although the genetic data for cox1 gene \nare not available for I. telanganaensis, both I. neeleshi \nand I. rajeevi are distinct from it in cytb gene sequence. \nFor loaches, the interspecific genetic distances for cytb \ngene have been observed to range from 2.0% in Balitoridae\n(Tang et al. 2006) and 3.0% in Cobitidae (Perd-\nices et al. 2018) to 5.4% in Nemacheilidae (Bohlen et al. \n2020). As a result, the pairwise genetic distance of more \nthan 5.7% between I. neeleshi from all its known congeners\nand 11.8% between I. rajeevi from all its conge-\nners is high. Interestingly, although both I. rajeevi and I. \nevezardi are known from Krishna river system and both I. \nneeleshi and I. telanganaensis are known from Godavari \nriver system, they show large genetic divergence.\nConsistent with the arguments raised by Dahanukar et \nal. (2011), Keskar et al. (2018) and Katwate et al. (2020) \namong others, our study further suggests that the earliFigure\n9.
