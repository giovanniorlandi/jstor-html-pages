This rule applies to our Al\nlies as well as to our enemies.\n; All that we can hope for is that the AL\nliedisations, after winning a great victory,\nwill be wise enough to understand that\ntheir self-interest has a long-range, as wed\na> a short-range, view •\nTHIS long-range viewpoint emphasizes\nthe gaitm which will come to all peoples\nof peke#. It even\nleads hem to understand that temporary\ndisadvantages may bring future advan\ntages.\nThe observation has point in relation to\nthe United States. We have never been re\nluctant to establish nationalistic policies,\nregardless of their effect upon other na\ntions. .\nIt might be wise for us to carefully con\nsider the long-range effect of certain sel\nfish policies. If they pioduee another world\nwar, r either the people of the United States\nnor the Government itself will gain any\nthing tr* m a short-range viewpoint that is\nclouded and obscured by selfishness.\nArt calls t© I he good in man.\nHuman js, apparently insatiable;\nthe more we get, the more we want.\nGood works, at so much per year, do\nnot carry much weight with the wicked.\nThe go-to-church movement can be\ngiven your personal support without any\ncommunity drive.\nNow that the people of Key West have\nlearned to ceoperate in war work, for the\n;cmmon good, why not remember the les\nion when the emergency is over and work\nfor deserving public causes after the war?\nPHILISOPHY OF LIFE\nKeep on doing as long as you are able\nto do. That seems to be as good as any oth\nphilosophy of life. We are done for as soon\nas we stop doing; we may keep on living hut\nlife, when we stop doing, no longer affords\nus the satisfaction of sensing the feeling\nthat is allied to w f ork well done.\nWe read the 10-years-ago column in\nThe Citizen and sometimes we run across an\nitem of So-and-So who kept on working\ntill he went to bed for the last time.\n“Of what good was his life to him?”\nsome of us may ask. “It was nothing but\nwork, work, work; he worked to the very\nend.”\nYou may be sure he found satisfaction\nin his work, you may be sure he would have\nbeen restless had he abandoned his work,\nand the probability is he would have died\nlong before he did had he not kept himself\noccupied.\nNo pleasure lasts longer than the reali\nzation of work well done, and no man is un\nhappy who is able to look forward to some\nthing to do or. the morrow; to whom the\nmorrow is a blank, so far as doing some\nthing is concerned, finds life a dreary thing.\nOne can not be contented if he is unoccu\npied.\nDoing simple things fills the gap that\noccurs when one retires or Is retired from\nbusiness. Cato, considered the greatest Ro\nman of his age, worked in his gardens and\n! fields after his retirement from public life.\nAnd his writings about the soil and its pro\nduction have been classics for 2,000 years\nand will continue to be classics as long as\nman lives.\nYears ago the writer asked the late Sam\nGates why he didn’t let up a little in his\nwork. Sometimes he worked in his black\nsmith shop from 3:30 in the morning till\ndaylight and then at his ways from sun to\nsun.\n“If I stop working,” he said, “I’ll he\ndead ir. a couple of weeks.”\nHe was devoted in his work, he got\ngenuine pleasure in doing things and doing\nthem well, and he lived to a grand old age.\nLife is work; take work away from us,\nand we are a prey to ennui. You may sav\nthat a lazy man seems to get a kick out of\nliving, but no man, whose senses are unim\npaired, can be lazy and happy too. Time\nhangs heavily on his hands, and he doesn’t\nknow what to do with himself; he goes\nhither and yon, but wherever he goes, he\nfaces the specter of discontent.\nEverybody is for price control if it\ndoesn’t affect his individual profits.\nThe individual who attempts to re\nform the entire human race has an exag\ngerated opinion of his. or her, ability.\nThe German soldier, is said, no longer\nwants to fight—he has had enough. The\nonly thing keeping him at the front is the\nfear of revenge.\nKey West should respond one hundred\nper cent to the Red Cross War Relief Fund.\nEveryone should appreciate the wonderful\ncontribution this great organization is mak\ning all over the world at this time, particu\nlarly. H §\ni ..\nHideki Tojo, the Japanese premier.\n, pdd.that f.the year in which the issue\nof Ihe world tfar must be decided. Let us\nhope that he is correct, for it is sure that\nthe Allies will get the decision, and the\nsooner the better.\nADVERTISING DISCOUNT\nNow that ineome tax payments are in\nthe minds of citizens and business men we\ncall attention to the fact that business can\nseefire a liberal discount on advertising in\n1943.\nAny business that has to pay an income\ntax can spend a reasonable amount in ad\nvertising with the government contributing\nj the amount of the tax. If profits are taxable\nto the extent of twenty per cent, your ad\ni vertising will cost you a net of only eighty\nper cent of what you pay.\nWe would not advise a business man to\nthrow away money on advertising schemes.\nHe should carefully scrutinize advertising\nexpenditures in order to be sure that he is\nnot giving away more than the amount of\n| the tax involved.\nAdvertising has suffered tremendously\nt from the snappy ideas of promotional sales\nmen. It has been banged again and again\ni by flaml>ouyant copy that may fool the\nbusiness man but never fools the advertis\ner. The old game of getting the advertiser\'s\nmoney, without caring a hoot about the re\nsults that follow, is taboo with most repu\n; table newspapers.\nTHE KEY WEST CITIZEN\nIT TAKES BOTH TAXES AND BONDS;\n!

Our allies, now drawing food\nsupplies from our production pool,\nwill have clear claim on further\nfood supplies during the recon\nstruction period.\nIt is even probable that the van\nwished Axis peoples will have to\nbe fed while the post-war world is\nbeing fashioned.\nAM On Short Rations\nEverything points to a whole\nworld on short rations for at least\none crop year after the war, the\nU.

Applications for most of\nthem were entered prior to Pearl\'\nHarbor.\nPocket Ash Tray\nThat pocket ash tray might be\nthe answer to a bridge party\nhostess’ prayer. If you couldn\'t\nfind a regular ash tray, there\nwould be no need of flicking\nyour cigaret on the sly behind\nthe radiator. All you’d have to\ndo would be to take your own\ntray out of your pocket.
