"It\nwould be fun to tell the others w e were\nthe only ones to witness the happy\ncouple\' departure."\n"Would it be safe?" asked the\nmaid.\n\'"Think of the rice and ribbon\nthey\'ve wasted, and their disgust\nwhen they learned how neatly they\'ve\nbeen fooled." The groomsman chuck\nled with delight at the thought. "I\nihiagine they will not be very amiable\nwhen they learn hew clever Ndl and\nTom have been. Then, too, they may\nthink we were in the plot; yet I had\nabsolutely no idea where we were to\nbe driven when we got into thia car\nriage." "Nor I. I wonder why they brought\nus? The men told me at the club\ndinner, the other night, that they\nwould all be glad to pay him back a\nfew, and give him a dose of his ow n\nmedicine. He vowed, then and there,\nthat no one would have a chance to\nmake a fool of him at a public sta\ntion. Both Nell and he were deter\nmined that no one should know even\nwhere they, meant to go."\n"Yet that very night Nell asked me\nto see her off, and told me where they\nwere going," laughed the maid.\n"So much for the constancy of\nwoman. You must have done some\nline wire-pulling to bring it about.\nTell me how you managed."\nThe maid\'s cheeks grew very rosy,\nand she hesitated!\n"Do you know, I would rather like\nto tell you about it, because an hon\nest man\'s opinion from a worldly\npoint of view might relieve me very\ngreatly, and when you are bark in the\nwest, you\'ll soon forget the story,\nwhich is what I want, you to do."\n"I am quite likely to forget any-i\nthing that concerns you!" thought\nthe nan. Aloud, he said: "Please tell\nme."\n"The night of the club dinner," be\ngan the maid, "I stayed with Nell,\nand among other things she told me\nof a joke she pfayed on me at one\ntime about which she had since felt\nrather guilty. She wanted to \'fess\'\nbefore she was married, feeling sure\nof my forgiveness at such a time, I\nsuppose.\n"During my whole life nothing has\never occurred to make me so thor\noughly angry a this, and, bad it not\nbeen that I disliked to make Nell un\nluppy at such a time, I wouldn\'t have\nMoused her so easily."\nThe maid\'s eyes sparkled and her\nlittle mouth was firmly closed.\n"What a fearful joke it must have\ntan!" commented the man, who was\ntudying her face whenever unob\nserved. "This \'joke,\' to use Nell\'s mild\nterra, took place four years ago, and\nnever could have been perpetrated,\n\'ad it not been for my unbounded\nelf-conceit. You see, my father\nihed to bring me up in a thorough\nly \'elf-dependent manner, and when\nB died my guardian tried to carry\nont his ideas, without giving me the\nlod example of father\'s wise judg\nment. At a very early age, I was al\nlowed almost complete control over\ntoy home life and personal affairs. I\ntraveled alone, and, in fact, had many\nPrivileges that young girls should not\n""e. Naturally, I acquired a very\nkr?e amount of self-esteem."\n"Which did not hurt you at all,"\nWerjected the listener.\n"One day I was at Nell\'s Tom was\n"ere, too, I remember and she had\nTV returned from Chicago. She\nhad\ncome through from the coa-st,\ntraveling with heraur.t to that point,\nand from there alone. In spcakingof\nher trip, she mentioned the annoy\nance some vulgar man had caused by\ninsisting upon drawing her into con\nversation. I laughed, and said she\nmust have given him seme reason to\nthink he could talk to her, for 1 had\ngone about alone, much more than\nmost girls, and had never yet met\nwith the slightest impertinence.\n"I suppose 1 did speak rather posi\ntively, and it provoked Nell, although\nI didn\'t mean to be the least bit per\nsonal. But she decided that 1 needed\na little lesson to humble me, and her\nopportunity soon came. Two nights\nlater, I went away on business, and\nboth Nell and Tom were at the train.\nI remember I was surprised to see\nthem when they came into the sta\ntion, because I was taking frequent\nbusiness trips at that time, and they\nhad never been down to see me off\nuntil that night. They were unusu\nally jolly, and went into the sleeping\near and helped me find my berth."\n"I should have thought such un\nusual attentions would have aroused\nyour suspicions."\n"They didn\'t. After the train\npulled out, I settled myself to reading,\nand was deep in an interesting article,\nwhen a man paused in the aisle out\nside my seat, and a strange voice said:\n\'Whv, Miss Brice, this is a pleas\nure!\'" "At once Nell\'s prophecy: \'Some\nday you may meet with the same ex\nperience, and through no fault of\nyours,\' flashed across my mind, but\nwhen I heard my name, I was reas\nsured, although I could not remem\nber having met the man before.\n" \'1 was in the day coach,\' he said,\n\'and was sure 1 saw yon come aboard\nwith Miss Linton and Tcm Kdeerton.\nYouwon\'t besounkind as to forbidme\nthis lucky chance,\' and he very calm\nly put his bags on the other half of\nthe seat and took the vacant place by\nmy side."\n"Without your permission?\'\'\n"I don\'t know. I was trying to re\ncall his name, and I paid almost no\nattention to his conversation, until\nnoticing my abstraction he said in\nsuch a surprised tone: \'I beg your\npardon if I\'ve intruded, Miss Brice.\nYou surely have not forgotten me?\'\n"I was rather embarrassed, for I\nthink it so stupid and horrid to forget\npeople. One should remember. T hen\nhe explained that I had met him in\nBrooklyn about a year before, and I\ninstantly recalled a time when Nell\nand I were over there and lunched\nwith some friends of hers whom we\nmet at the cafe. I had quite forgotten\nhis face, but decided that this must\nbe the man. Even then I couldn\'t\nremember the name, but I thought I\nhad displayed enough ignorance, and\nhoped it would come to me later."\n"Was he entertaining?"\n"Very, lie told me several clever\nstories, and while in the middle of\none, which I found particularly amus\ning, the porter came along, and - he\nsaid there could be no tuikins in the\nsleeper after nine o\'clock. We asked\nfor a few minutes\' grace, but the\ndarky was obdurate. I said I was\nsorry to miss the point of that story,\nand then that man did the one thing\nfor which I cannot forgive him. He\nsuggested my going into the day\ncoach while my berth was being made\nup, and he would finish the story\nthere."\n"What a brute!" exclaimed the\nman. "And did you go?"\nThe woman gave him a sharp\nglance, but his face betrayed nothing\nexcept the keenest interest.\n"1 was foolish enough to go," she\nplied, flushing. "I was so interested\nin his story, you know," she added,\nhalf in apology. "From that he drift\ned on to a trip through Arizona, and\nhis encounter with the Snake In\ndians following out the article I had\nbeen reading, until fully an hour had\npassed before I realized how time was\nslipping away. Then I went back to\nthe sleeper and when I realized my\nfolly but I\'ll skip that."\n"Why? Did you give yourself a bad\nhalf hour?"\n"Two hours, I should say Nell\ncame over and stayed the-first night\nI was home, and, of course, I lost no\ntime asking her if she remembered\nthat Brooklyn friend who lunched,\nwith us there a year ago. She said\nshe did, and that she had received a\nletter from him that very week.\n"\'Had a letter from him!\' I ex\nclaimed. \'Why, where is he?\'\n"\'In Paris,"\' she answered. \'He\nwent a few weeks after I met him.\nj He is studying there, and remains in\ndefinitely.\' I "I couldn\'t sav a word, for a dread\nful realization, of what I had done\nflashed over me in a second, and I\nfully understood how much gossip\nmight be woven about my innocent\nmistake, and how gullible I must\nlave seemed to that man. Through\nit all I was strorgly conscious of hav\ning said nothing to Nell and being\nthankful for that one Lit of luck."\n"Did you never mention it to her?"\n"Not until last Thursday night,\nwhen Nell confessed she was the orig-.\nir.ator of the whole affair. It seemed\nthat after I left her house that after\nnoon, she and Tom decided .that it\nwould be the best thing in the world\nfor me to get a bitter lesson one\nthat would kill my conceit. She pro\nposed the plan they adopted, know\ning that this friend of TCm\'s, who\nwould be on the train, w ould Le very\ndiscreet when they explained the ob\nject of the plot to him. She told me\nmany things about him, trying, I sup\npose, to change my opinion of him,"\nwith a very scornful curve of her\nlips. \'\n"What was your opinion?" The\nman seemed much interested. "What\ndid she tell you?"\n"Not what he would care to hear.\nOh, that he was the most perfect gen\ntleman Tom knew, and all such non\nsense. They had to praise him in\norder to defend their own conduct."\n"Did Nell tell you who he was and\nwhere he lived?"\n"Not his, name. She said he was\na college friend of Tom\'s, and his peo\nple live in Rhode Island, I think.\nNell was sincere in her belief that her\nlesson would have good results, but\nshe might have given me one which\nwouldn\'t have stung my self-respect\nso bitterly. I think she realized this,\nfor she was truly penitent the other\nnight. All sorts of peace offerings\nwere made, and this privilege of see\ning her off, extended to none of the\nother maids, was one. Now you\nknow what fine wire-pulling I did,"\nfinished the maid, bitterly.\n"And I, as a groomsman, had to be\nan equal sharer of your privilege,"\nsaid the man, musingly. He was silent\nfor a minute. "Why did you want to\ntell me the story," he asked, turning\nquickly to the maid.\n"Because I want you, as a worldly\nman, to imagine yourself this other\nman, if it\'s possible. Think of the\ncircumstances connected, and then\ntell me w hat opinion he had of .me.\nHad he not lost all the respect for me\nthat he might have entertained at the\nbeginning, when he asked me to go\nto the day coach?"\n"No. You have Nell\'s word that he\nwas a gentleman. Perhaps he had\nmeant to have a few words of conver\nsation, but found you far more inter\nesting than you found him, and, for\ngetting the circumstances, treated\nyou as a lady of his acquaintance. He\nprobably regrets it now far more than\nyou think. A man can do a great\ndeal of thinking in four years, you\nknow. Y\'ou will decide to forgive it,\nsome day."\n"There\'s no occasion for me to\nthink of that probability, for it is not\npossible that be would be bold enough\nto meet nie and ask for my forgive\nness. But here we are at the house.\nComing in?"\n"No, I have to attend to some busi\nness of Tom\'s which he completely\nforgot, but I\'ll be around by nine this,\nevening for you and your aunt. Re\nmember my heaven lasts only until\nthat seven o\'clock train pulls out to\nmorrow night; so be as generous with\nyour dances this evening as you can.\nAu rcvoir."\nThe maid went slowly up the\nsteps.\n"If I have made that man suffer\none-tenth the agony he caused me,\nI\'ll try to forgive him when the right\ntime comes," she mused. "Nell must\nhave thought me very dense, though\nshe did try so nobly to shield him.\nFunny w hat a difference a beard and\nglasses make in a man\'s appearance!"\n"How could lever have been such a\ncad!" said the man to himself as he\ndrove down the street. "I\'ll make her\nlove me, though, in spite of all, and\nI\'ll never tell her until the right\ntime comes that I am the hero of her\ntrip on the train." Housekeeper. .\nBid (or the Ere.\nThe curved pages of an ordinary\nbook are injurious to the eyes. Mr.\nF. G. Murphy shows that the curved\npage causes a constant change of the\nfocus of the eye, as it reads from one\nside to the other, necessitating a con\ntinued effort on the part of the ciliary\nmuscles. The light also falls unequal\nlyupon both sides, furtherinterfering\nwith a continued clear field of vision.\nHe, therefore, suggest that the print\ned lines run parallel to the binding\ninstead of at right angles to it, so that\nail parts of the line would be at an\nequal distance from the eye and be\nequally lighted.\nPromising Hen.\nPromising men are so numerous\nthat it is a great pleasure to meet a\nman who hasactbally done something.\nAtchison Glebe.,\nHALF A MAN.\nA New Gueuing Game How Much Doea\nHe Weigh?\nThey have a tew game on Broad\nway. It is betting on the weight of\nhalf a man that is, his trunk with\nout the legs. What would seem to\nbe an impossibility, but read further.\nOne day last week, an old gam\nbler was lounging in front of a Ten\nderloin cafe, probably wishing some\nine would invent a game that everv\none else was not "on to." Presently\nne observed a mendicant with both\nlegs off close to the hips crawling\nalong the sidewalk offering for sale\npencils that would not make a mark. I\nThe torso of the mendicant was very\nlarge and powerful, he had a large\nhead, and his arms were those of a\ngiant. The gambler eyed the beggar\nin a speculative w ay for a moment or\ntwo as he hobbled down the street on\nhis leather-clad stumps. Then he\nstarted after him.\nAt the corner the gambler beck\noned him, and, stooping over him,\ntalked rapidly for a few moments. A\ncoin was passed to the cripple, and\nthe gambler sauntered back to the\ncafe, in front of which was a gather\ning of choice spirits. .In a few mo\nments the mendicant came hobbling\nslowly along.\n"Get on to that fellow," said the\ngambler. "How much do you suppose\nhe weighs?"\nThe others looked at the approach\ning cripple and sized him up as they\nwpuld a horse or anything else in\nwhich there was a possible bet.\n"Oh! about 120 pounds, 1 guess,"\nsaid one.\n"Rats!" exclaimed another. "I\'ll\nbet he doesn\'t weigh more than 95\nor 100 pounds." Nearly all made\nguesses, varing from ten to twenty\npounds.\n"Let\'s make a pool," said the dis\ncoverer of the mendicant. "Every\nfellow mark his guess and his name\non a piece of paper and put it in\nbox and drop a live-dollar note in\nwith it. Then we\'ll weigh the\ngeezer, and whoever comes nearest\nto his weight takes the pot."\nThis looked liki a good but not a\nsure thing for anyone, and so all\nagreed to go in. The man had now\nreached the group and offered his pen\ncils. "Say," said his discoverer, "do you\nwant to make a dollar? If you do,\nwait a minute, and get weighed."\nThe mendicant agreed, and all re\ntired to the restaurant, where the pa\npers were prepared and put in a\ndrawer, together with the money.\nOther men in the cafe, hearing of\nthe pool, expressed a desire to get in,\nand were accommodated.\nWhen the pool was closed, the men\ndicant was taken to an automatic\nweighing machine, and a nickel was\ndropped into the slot. The hand flew\naround and stopped at the 185-pound\nmark. Then there was a roar that\nthe machine was out of order and\nthat it did not register properly.\n"What!" exclaimed the man who\nhad guessed 115 pounds, "that rem\nnant weigh 185 pounds! Nit. That\nmachine isn\'t on the square, and\nought to be ruled off.\'\'\nTo appease the crowd the mendi\ncant was taken to another cafe and\nweighed, and the result was not three\nounces different.\nWhen the papers were opened there\nwere only two men who had guessed\nwithin 50 pounds of the mendicant\'s\ncorrect weight. One was the gam\nbler, who had first seen the mendi\ncant. His guess was two pounds over,\nThe other was a quiet young man,\nwho had said nothing all through the\ncontroversy. He guessed four pounds\nunder. The gambler took the pot\nand explained to the crowd that when\nhe was a boy he lived in the country\nand used to guess at the weight of\nhogs at fairs, and the pot was his re\nward for experience. The others had\nguessed that a man of the mendicant\'s\nbulk must have weighed, with his full\ncomplement of limbs, about 250\npounds, more or less. On this they\nbased their guesses, simply cutting\ntheir original estimate in half, be\ncause the subject was only half a\nman. They had forgotten that the\nlower half of a man his two legs\ndo not weigh as much as the torsa,\nin which are the vital organs and the\nbulk of the blood in the system.\nAfter the crowd had dispersed the\ngambler went to the quiet young\nman whom he had beaten by only two\npounds, and said:\n"Were you on, too? Do you know,\nI came near putting down the weight\nyou did, and then I thought perhaps\nsome foxy guy might get next, so I\nmade up my mind to get right close\nwithout guessing his weight exactly."\nThe young man looked at the gam\nbler and then said: "So that is how\nyou won, eh? Just give me my five\nback or I\'ll put jour friend nut.\nI\'m a doctor, and I guessed pretty\nnearly what the man\' weight would\nhave been complete. Then I figured\nthe proportions in which his legs\nstood to his torsa and deducted it\nfrom the total weight, and the result\nwas my guess. I know something\nabout anatomy. But my guess was\non the square and based on knowledge,\nwhile yours was a skin game."\nThe gambler offered to divide the\npot with the doctor, who refused it,\ninsisting, however, on the return of\nwhat he had put into the pot. The\ngambler went to another cafe with\nhis mendicant in tow. N. Y. Herald.\nCURIOUS THEORIES.\nRegarding the World\' Superior and In\nferior Kacea.\nThat North America is one of the\ngreat powers is pretty widely known,\nbut it has remained for Dr. Lehr, an\ninfluential member of the Alldeutsch-\ner Verbund, to state precisely why\ndestiny has selected her as one of its\nfavorites in this respect. The doctor\nis a pan-Germanist, and his ethno\ngraphic theories, which he has been\nexpounding to scientists and govern\nment officials at Brussels, are decided\nly novel.\nAccording to him there are three\ngreat races in the world the Ger\nman, the Anglo-Saxon and the Slavic,\nand they have the exclusive right to\nfight or dispute among themselves for\nthe supremacy of the globe. The first\nof these races comprises Germany,\nAustria, Holland, Denmark, Sweden,\nNorway and the Flemish residents of\nBelgium; the second comprises Eng\nland, the British colonies and North\nAmerica, and the third embraces\nRussia in Europe and Asia, as well as\nthe Czech and Slavic populations of\nBohemia, Moravia, Illyria, the Bal\nkans and the adjoining states. Ac\ncording to this theory anyone who is\nborn a German, an Anglo-Saxon or\na Slav inherits a certain definite\nchance in the lottery, the great prize\nin which is world supremacy. On the\nother hand, all those who have the\nmisfortune to be born Spaniards, Ital\nians, Frenchmen, Roumanians or\nSouth Americans are rot only de\nbarred forever from purchasing even\nthe smallest ticket in- this lottery, but\nare also destined to become eventu\nally the subjects or bond slaves of the\nfortunate prize winenrs.\nThat a conflict between the three\ndominant races is inevitable and w ill\nsoon take place Dr. Lehr is convinced.\nNot one of the three, he points out,\nhas an exclusive right to rule the\nworld, and in order that any one of\nthem may acquire this right a con\nflict is necessary. For this reason, he\ncontinues, Germany and her de\npendencies meaning thereby Flem\nish Belgium and the low countries\nought to prepare for a war first against\nEngland and then against Russia.\nIncidentally, too, he reminds the\nBelgians that tha Boers are an inte\ngral part of the German race, and that\nthe war in the Transvaal is an addi\ntional reason why the hands of Ger\nntany should be strengthened against\nEngland and why special efforts\nshould be made to increase the Ger\nman fleet.\nFrenchmen are much amused at\nthese theories, and one of them, M.\nHenri des Houx, says: "So we are\nworthless Latins, a rich booty for the\nworld conquerors nothing more?\nWhen will these German savaps stop\nmaking fun of us with their para\ndoxes? If. they are pan-Germanists,\nlet them tell the Belgians and the\nDutch that they want to annex them.\nIf they are jealous of England, let\nthem stop flirting and concluding se\ncret treaties with her. If they desire\nto make war on Russia, as they talk\nof doing, they will soon find out\nwhether France is a negligeable quan\ntity and whether we are an inferior\nrace." N. Y. Herald.\nOddly Located Churche.\nOne of the best-known instance\nin the United Kingdom of churche\nwith streets through them is that of\nSt. John the Baptist\'s church in Bris\ntol. Here we have the church situ\nated right over the ancient gateway\ninto the city on the Avon, and the\ntowering spire standing high above\nthe neighboring hguses and streets\nis a remarkable sight, as one surveys\nit from the roadway below. The\nChurch of St. John the Baptist in\nBristol is a very old one. It occu\npies the whole width of the famous\ncity wall and what was part of the\nold fosse or ditch. On each side of\nthe central arch that cuts through\nthe tower of the church is a smaller\nopening for pedestrian traffic, and\nthese were made so late as. the pres\nent century. Before they existed the\nsides of the gateway were part of the\nchurch, too.

It is a mass of silver\nSpanish dollars, numbering some 500,\nwhich have been melted in fantastic\nshape.

"I venture the pre\ndiction that the average well to do\nfamily will be making its own ice in\nside the next two years. For a long\ntime past a number of the cleverest\ninventors in the country have been\ntrying to devise a small, compact ice\nmachine, with a capacity of from 50\nto 500 pounds a day, that can be op-,\nerated by any domestic servant, and\nthey have made sufficient progress to\nbring success clearly in view. It is an\ninteresting fact that nearly all the\nremarkable improvements which have\nbeen piade in large commercial ma\nchines during the last two or three\nyears have suggested themselves in\nthis tireless search for a practical\nhousehold apparatus.\n"When I say that success is in sight,\nI mean that all the most serious prob\nlems have been solved, and the diffi\nculties that remain to be overcome\nare purely mechanical. As a matter\nof fact, four or five small machines are\nalready in the market, but none of\nthem quite meets flie requirements.\nThe ideal apparatus for use in cities\nwill probably obtain its power from\nan incandescent lamp socket, just like\nthe ordinary elecfric fan. The cook\nwill fill up the receiver with water,\nmake the connection and go about her\nbusiness.\n"There is nothing Utopian about\nthis little forecast. Private ice plants\nare already practical for very small\ncommercial concerns restaurants,\nconfectioners, etc. and the house\nhold machine is one of the advances\nalong the line of domestic economy to\nwhich we may look forward withal).\nsolute confidence.

What we learned\nmay have been good enough for us,\nbut it does not suffice for our chil\ndren. They do not spend as much\ntime as their elders did over Latin,\nand Greek, but they spend more time\nat French, German, Italian and Span\nish. They do not pore over historic\nof Punic wars, or rack their brain\ntrying to remember the various me\nters in which Horace wrote his mem\norable odes, hut, on the contrary.\nthey study modern history and take\na healthy interest in geology, botany.\nphysiology and other branches of\nmodern science. They do not com\nmit to memory the names, dates and\nachievements of distinguished, yet\nrather nebulous, personages who lived\nhundreds of years ago, but, instead,\nthey strive to acquire an adequate\nknowledge of themselves and of their\nsurroundings. The girls do not spend\nlong hours tatting, or crocheting, or\nknitting, or studying the art of de\nportment, but give their time to the\nstudy of some branch of knowledge\nwhich will be of actual use to them\nin everyday life.\nTradition for a long t\'me dictated\nthat certain subjects should be taught\nin schools and universities, but the\nmodern spirit does not bow to tradi\ntion, and is strongly inclined not to\nfavor any subject unless its practical\nusefulness can be clearly demon\nstrated. This being a scientific age,\nit was imperative that modern sci\nence in all its branches should bo\ntaught in our schools and colleges,\nand there are abundant signs that it\nimportance as an educational factor\nis increasing year by year. Lover\nof the classics and those who believe\nthat the old times were the best may\nexclaim that the children of to-day\nwill grow up rank materialists, and\nthe elderly pessimists among them\nmay regret their lost youth and sigh.\nBut all others who recognize the\nneeds of the age will welcome the\nmodern changes in the method of\neducation.. And the classics are not\ndead, nor likely to die. The only dif\nference between the present and the\npast is that a knowledge of Latin\nand Greek is no longer considered at\na test of a liberal education. The\ntruth is, so many new branches of\nknowledge well worthy of careful\nstudy have developed within the last\ndecade or two that even the most\nassiduous student finds it hard to ob\ntain an adequate knowledge of more\nthan a few of them. The result it\nthat the world has to-day more spe\ncialists than it ever had.\nFinally, be it noted as a matter\nfor congratulation that more atten\ntion is paid to-day to the physical\nwell being 6f students than was ever\npaid in the old days.

Wlaelereak aad a\nBral vruBHi ta lac Faraa\nThar Hart e Eaaal.\nIn planting Tergrnt for a wind\nbreak, it i we\',1 to rrmrmber that the\nbest result art obtained hD the\ntrees are clukf!; branched cVar to the\nground, thus jrivinif an upward cur\ning surface that terms to turn the wind\nupward, giving protwtion to a building\neven taller than the row of treen. This\nidea is shown in the cut, the dotted line,\nshowing the direction of the wind. If\nthe trees are not thick at their bases\nthe wind will not be thus deflected up\nward and the chief talue of the hedge\nas a windbreak is lost.\nAnd riirht here it is to be remembered\nthat to secure an erenjreen tree close\nbranched to the ground the trees must\nEVERGREENS AS WINDBREAKS.\nnot be planted too closely together.\nWhen evergreens crowd each other the\ncrowded portion is quite sure to die\nout, leaving open spaces for the wind to\nblow through. In setting out a wind\nbreak, therefore, put the trees far\nmough apart so that when they be\ncome of average size they will form a\ncompact screen. In setting out small\ntrees one is always in danger of setting\nthem too near together, whether they\nbe fruit tree or ornamentals. The ul\ntimate size of the tree must always be\nkept in mind when setting it out. It is\nasserted by those who have had ex\nperience that a double row of ever\ngreens do not afford so good a protec\ntion from the wind as a single row- that\nhas grown up into a compact hedge,\nsince the double rows so shade some of\nthe trees that they do not grow well.\nIn transplanting evergreens it is im\nportant to keep the roots from becom\ning dry and to give plenty of moisture\nafter setting. When the roots of an\nevergreen get thoroughly dried out its\nchances for life are very small, indeed.\nN. Y. Tribune.\nMUST USE WIDE TIRES.\nProrUlon at aa Exrellrat Law\nPa. teal hi- the Progressive Lett\nlalalurt of Matnarhaaett.\nThe wide-tire law, passed by the Mas\nsachusetts legislature through the ef\nforts of the Massachusetts division of\n!he League of American Wheelmen, pro\nvides that on and after January 1, 1902,\n"It shall be unlawful, except as pro\nvided in section 4 of this act, to use\nupon any road, itreet or way in this\ncommonwealth a draft wagon or cart\nhaving tires of lroi or steel, or of any\nsubstance equally hard, which are less\nin width than one and one-half times\nthe diameter of the axle, measured at\nthe shoulder thereof; but in no case\nshall a tire more than four inches In\nwidth be required, and wagons and\ncarts built with wooden or hollow axles\nshall have tires not lest in width than\nthe diameter of the axle, measured at\nthe shoulder thereof.\n"This act shall apply to all wagons\nand carts the axles of which are two\nInches or more in diameter, measured\nas aforesaid, and to all stjige coaches,\ntally-ho coaches, barges and other pas\nsenger vehicles not built to run on iron\nor steel rails and constructed to carry\neight or more persons."\nThe fourth section states tbnt the\nact shall not apply to wagons or other\nvehicles owned and used in the state on\nJanuary 1, 1902. This is the weak\nclause in the bill, putting off the best\neffects of the law for many years. The\npenalty for violation of tht law is a\nfine not exceeding $100.\nAdvantages of liar Caps,\nAt the present prices of cotton cloth\na set of good hay caps a yard square\nwould sometimes pay for themselves in\na single season, when a wet spell\ncatches the farmer with a lot of hay\nnearly cured enough for the barn. It is\nboth provoking and a sure loss to have\na good crop of what should have been\ngood hay converted into bedding or\nsomething worse than that, after one\nhas worked two or three days to get\nit fit for the barn. Yet we have often\nseen this happen. A cap a yard square\nwill cover a good-sized tumble of hay\nor shock of grain, as if it does not\nreach the ground it is enough to have\nthe top well covered if the heap is prop\nerly made. We have heard some say\nthat the hay would spoil by heating\nunder the cap, but we never have had\nit do so. Prairie Farmer.\nSystem of Renin- Frnlt.\nCooperative marketing of nn\'ts\nshould be encouraged. The losses that\noccur to fruit men everv time we have\na good crop of any kind of fruit dis\ncourage the fruit growers. The quan\ntities of peaches that rot on the glut\nted markets woold bring pleasure to a\nmultitude of consumers. It is the hit-or-miss\nmethod of distribution that is\nlargely responsible for the losses. The\nsystematic distribution of fruit will be\nthe forerunner of better methods for\nutilizing the surplus of fruit and of\nkepping it until it can be used by the\npeople.\nPlaatlaaj Trees for Timber.\nThe planting of waste land to trees\nfor timber is receiving more attention\nthan formerly. Farmers who planted\ntrees 20 years ago now find that they\nthen made good investments. It ia\nclaimed that cherry and hickory trees\nrequire about 30 years before they are\nvaluable for timber; maple trees, 20\nrears, and black walnut, IS years. A\nblack walnut tree is said to attain\nfrom 12 to IS inches in diameter in\n15 years from the seed. Nuts are also\n1 source of profit with some growers\nif timber.\n: Jl\nSCUXCE AND INDUSTRY.\nOf the total track mileage in England\n6ne-;h r j is owntd bv the public\nS.Ik worms, in Flammarion\'s ex\nperiments, have attained their maxi\nmum production in white, red and blue\nlight.\nJaVasure ments by an American mi\neroscopist to tt-.t the theory that the\nred blood corpusclea vary in size in\ndifferent races have failed to show any\nmarked differences.\nliter nt explorations show that Brazil\nxiuld. if pushed, furnish SO per cent,\nmore raw rubber than at present and\nthat the possibilities of Africa as a\nrubber exporting continent are lim\nitless.

Her\nhusband, relates the Chicago Chron\nicle, pointed out to her the advantages\nof keeping the family nest-egg in a\nbank and drawing interest upon it in\nstead of letting it rust and get dusty\nin a deposit vault, and after he had\nmade some figures she was impressed\nwith the idea and transferred the ac\ncount. The next day she had a bill to pay\nand drifted blithely over to the bank\nafter doing a day\'s shopping to draw\nher (25. She found the massive doors\nshut and a card staring at her said\nin the meanest way possible: "Hanking\nhours 10 to 3." That was a surprise\nparty. She bad been used to going\nto the deposit vault to put in or take\njut her money at any and all Hours\neven at night and on Sunday and here\nwag an institution which closed for the\nday about the time her day really be\nSfan. But she had learned her lesson\nand determined hereafter to be on\nband before three o\'clock.\nThe next time she wanted to make a\ndraft on her account chanced unluckily\nto be on a Saturday. She never gavi\nthe matter a thought until the last\nday of the week, and then let it go until\n2:45. A glance at a down-town clock\nwarned her that she had no time to\nlose and she hurried breathlessly\nacross town only to see the sarcastic\nplacard once more remarking: "Hank\ning hours Saturday 10 to 12."\nThen she was angry. She allowed\nshe would have no more to do with\nbanks, but would return to the de\nposit vault, where she could get her\nmoney whenever she wanted it. The\nnext time she made a deposit, however,\nhappened to be the day for crediting\ninterest, and she was so tickled at get\nting $1.4fi without earning it that she\nwas reconciled to the savings banks.\nThere was a slight flurry the other way\nwhen she got to the bank in plenty of\ntime, but found she could not get any\nmoney because she had forgotten her\npassbook, but the final blow fell last\nWednesday. She wanted a little money\nnot much, and that\'s what added to\nher indignation at what occurred. A\nten-dollar bill would just about fix\nthings, and she made a special trip\ndown-town to get it. In serene confi\ndence she walked up to the big doors,\nand her old friend the placard actually\nseemed to grin as it said:\ni THIS BANK WILL BE CLOSED :\'\n: ON MEMORIAL DAY. :\ni i\nShe is going buck to the deposit\nvault.\nTrain stopped at lledalrle.\nA curious wreck occurred the other\nmorning on a spur of the Michigan\nCentral railway which extends from\nthe main line almost two miles down a\nheavy grade to a dam across the St.\nJoseph river, says a Buchanan (Mich.)\ncorrespondent of the Chicago Record.\nA heavy freight that was backed upon\nthe siding broke into three sections\nand ran away. The conductor on the\nrear section jumped, escaping with\nslight injury, although the train bad\nattained great speed. The middle sec\ntion ran into the rear section and\nshoved it 200 feet beyond the end ol\nthe line, although the track was three\nfeet lower than the surface of the sur.\nrounding ground. The caboose then\ncrashed into and demolished the house\noccupied by William Morris and hi!\nthree children, stopping just as it\nreached the parents\' bed. All occu\npants of the house escaped without in\njury. Next to the caboose aera three\nbig furniture cars.\nCeaaae Pleaaaatrr.\nCeitus Taker You lira here, do Tan?\nWell, what relation are you to the bead\naf the hnuae?\nCitisen Set here, now, don\'t get too\ncanny, or i u go ana call Her in.
