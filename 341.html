I\nI\nCapt. Andrew Moses, whoTtrr four\nyears has been commandant of cadets\nand instructor in military science at\nA. & M. college, was the recipient of\na pretty compliment from his Masonic\nfriends of Bryan and College last\nevening. Inasmuch as he has suc\ncessfully passed his examination for\npromotion to a majorship in the Unit\ned States army and expects his com\nmission to be issued soon, his friends\nconceived the Idea that it would be\nfitting for them to present him with\nelegant major\'s shoulder straps be\nfore he left the college.\nAccordingly the straps were Ordered\nthrough Mr. P. S. Park, and on last\n- evening the following committee went\nout to College to make the presenta\ntion: Gen. H. B. Stoddard, CaptW. E.\nSaunders, P. H. Park, Ed S. Derden,\nA. J. Buchanan, A.J. Wagner, G. A.\'\nAdams, M. L. Hewlt, and J. S. Doane,\nof Ennls, lessee of the new Hotel\nBryan. \'\nArriving at the college they were\nmet by Mr. George Grupe, Prof. F. E.\nGiesecke, Prof. C. P. Fountain, Mr.\nJ. M. Carson, Col. and Mrs. Milner,\nand Capt. and Mrs. Moses. The party\nproceeded to the mess hall where they\nwere most cordially received by Mr.\nand Mrs. B. Sbisa, and were given\nseats on the wide concrete walk In the\nmellow moonlight Immediately in\nfront of the mess hall.\nThe meeting was called to order by\nGen. H. B. Stoddard, who acted as\nmaster of ceremonies, and who intro\nduced Mr. P. S. Park, who, he said,\nwould state the purpose for which\nthey were come together.\n, Mr. Park stated that because his\nshoulders were broad, duties, both\npleasant and unpleasant, were laid\nupon him, but on this occasion he was\nglad to say the duty was a most pleas\nant one. While Captain Moses had re\nceived many good things since he had\nbeen at the college, yet bis friends did\nnot think he had had all that was\ncoming to him, and that he may get\nthe remainder was the purpose for\nwhich his friends had called.\n"Strapping," he said, had been pop\nular among the cadets, but .Captain\nMoses had escaped, and his friends\nhad come to strap him before he left\nthe college. He warmly congratulated\nCaptain Moses upon his course at A. &\nM., and said the heroic manner in\nwhich he had met crises and difficul\nties and surmounted them demon\nstrated the, fact that the blood of the\nlate Col. Norton Moses coursed\nthrough his veins. He spoke feelingly\nof the high regard in which he was\nheld by the boys of Texas, and how\nthey considered him the summum\nbonum of all that was good, true\' and\nnoble. He referred to his departure\nfor hlj new field of duty and adjured\nhim to remember the friends of Bryan\nand College who would watch with\npride his upward course and rejoice\nIn his every success. As a reminder,\nhis friends had provided for him the\n8houldci straps of a major and ex\npressed (he hope that be would appre\nciate them, not only as the gift of\nfriends, but also in all that they sym\nbolized. That each golden thread in\ntheir woof and warp represented\nthe golden threads of his heart, that\nwere forever entwined about the\nhearts of the boys of Texas.\nGen. H. B. Stoddard made the pres\nentation and in the course of his re\nmarks expressed the hope that in the\nprovidence of God the gold leaf of the\nstraps may some day be surmounted\nby a star, and in the fullness of time\nby a double star.\nThe response of Captain .Moses was\nfull of the deepest feeling and emo\ntion. He said h appreciated beyond\nthe power of words to express the\nlove and esteem of his menus or\nBryan and College. He appreciated\nthe words of good will that had been\nsaid, and declared the best and hap\npiest part of his stay at College was\nthe forming of so many true ond loyal\nfriendships. That whatever success he\nhad made at the college was due to\nthe support of his good friend3 and\nthe loyal cadets of the corps. That\nwhen far away at his new post of duty\nIt would be a pleasure for him, for\nMrs. Moses and little Kathleen to\nknow that they had a host of friends\nat Bryan and College who would, un\nder all cirmustances, "stand hitched."\nShort talks were mado by Col. R. T.\nMilner. A. J. Buchanan, Prof. C. P.\nFountain, Capt. W. E. Saunders, L. 7.\nHewlt, Prof. F. E. Giesecke, Mr.\nGeorge Grupe, Mr. B.

She leaves a devoted\nhusband and four small children, the\nyoungest being only a week old and\nthe eldest a little girl five years of\naj?e; an aged father, four sisters and\nthree brothers, and a ho3t of friends.\nShe was a member of the Methodist\nchurch and gave every evidence of\nbeing a true Christian. She told her\nhusband before she, bacem uncon\nscious that there was-nothing In the\nway, and that she did not fear death,\nbut hated to leave, her family. She\nwas kind and affectionate to all and\nmade friends wherever she went. To\nknow her was to love her. It was hard\nto see her taken from these little\nchildren and devoted husband.
