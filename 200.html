        <pre>['Enlightened Interaction between Agronomy a:nd \nAgricultural Economics \nD. I. Padberg* \nThis paper looks at a future in which both disciplines are \ncoping with a declining clientele and support base. It asks the \nquestion: Are there ways that we all can better cope with our \nproblems by working together? The concepts of systems analysis \nand holistic management are considered as a basis for multi- \ndisciplinary work. The implications for academic programs are \nconsidered. In the implications for research, attention is directed \nto ways of assessing what components of biological research \nresults might be expected to be commercially adopted. The case \nwas made that economic analysis gives several insights into the \ntranslation of new technology into commercial application. It \nwas concluded that working together more could improve our \njoint and separate products whether or not it might reverse the \ndecline we are experiencing. \nHE AGRICULTURAL programs at land-grant universities T are in a state of transition. Traditional sources \nof students and funding are unable to support these pro- \ngrams at present levels of activity. In response, we see \nefforts to identify new sources of funds and students. The \nthematic content of these efforts range from an embrace \nwith basic science to a greater emphasis on applica- \ntions-from gene splicing to holistic management. This \ntransition is unsettling. We are invited to deemphasize \nsuccessful and dependable patterns to enable the develop- \nment of new and unproven ones. Changes in our activi- \nties disturb our philosophic sense of where we fit into the \ngrand scheme of things. As we are asked to contribute \nto society in vastly different and untried ways, we are less \nsure that our contribution is important or essential. \nThis transition invites and tolerates a lot of introspec- \ntion. The leadership of your learned society has asked \nme to speculate about ways agronomists and agricultur- \nal economists might better work together. I believe this \ntrust comes from a growing appreciation for holistic \nmanagement or systems analysis. Most simply, this refers \nto ways to put technology (perhaps from several dis- \nciplines) in a management context. This management con- \ntent refers to the decisions a firm makes, as well as policy \ndecisions made to manage public enterprise. Whether or \nnot more was expected, my response is developed around \nthis theme. Suggestions coming from this discussion are \nmeant to complement, not substitute for, work in the \nmore basic science areas. \nThis paper presents a summary of the forces causing \nus to change and an assessment of how we might develop \na multidisciplinary response in both teaching and re- \nsearch. \nDep. of Agricultural Economics, Texas A&M Univ., College Station, \nTX 77843. *Corresponding author. \nPublished in J .  Prod. Agric. 3:170-173 (1990). \nFORCES CAUSING CHANGE \nMost of the discussion and analysis of the land-grant \nsystem relate to adapting the traditional (application- \noriented) teaching-research-extension format to a modern \nindustrial setting (Bonnen, 1986; Kohl et al., 1987; Knut- \nson, 1986; Ruttan, 1982; U.S. Congress, OTA, 1986). \nLurking in these discussions is the belief, or wish, that \nthis traditional format is worthy and, if adapted wisely \nand vigorously, it will be appreciated and supported by \nan industrial society. \nIt is possible that we will find the success of the land- \ngrant system to be a part of our American agrarian \nadolsecence. As our economy and political system grow \nup, the center of gravity moves away from agrarian issues \ntoward industrial and postindustrial issues. The agrari- \nan sector programs may wither and virtually disappear \n(as one finds in other developed economies), leaving both \nhigher education and research primarily in broad gener- \nal institutions rather than sector-oriented ones. \nWhy is the agricultural part of the land-grant system \nunder pressure at this time? The primary growth dynam- \nics in our economy have come from the nonfarm sectors \nfor several decades. The following observations among \nother influences may relate to timing. \nChanging Image of Agriculture. After a brief period \nof euphoria during the late 1970s, the image of agricul- \nture has suffered with the lengthening 1980s agricultural \ndepression. Enrollment in agricultural academic programs \nis affected, as are funding priorities for research. Over- \nproduction and government supports suggest an overbuilt \nand sick industry. \nEconomic Development Leads to a Relative Decline in \nTraditional Sectors. Economies become more diverse as \ndevelopment or growth occurs. All sectors, especially fun- \ndamental sectors like agriculture, become relatively \nsmaller. Sector-oriented programs are more difficult to \nsupport politically. \nPolitical Time Lags. Agrarian values and thinking may \ncontinue as long as a generation or more after people \nleave the country. The baby boomers now coming into \nleadership are our first urbadsuburban generation. \nPublic Funding Crisis. Rapid economic development \nafter World War I1 brought a period of easy growth of \ntax revenues. Educating the very young population be- \ncame a natural growth industry. Today we find that our \npopulation, our physical plant, and our work rules are \nolder and less competitive in the global economy. Tax \nrevenues are harder to raise.As states and the federal \ngovernment face great budgetary stress, more pressure \nis put on all programs. Welfare state programs for an \naging generation are powerful competitors. \n170 J .  Prod. Agric., Vol. 3, no. 2, 1990 \nPublished April 18, 2013\n', 'Changing Nature of Farm People. Most societies have \na general instinct to encourage an adequate food supply, \nas well as to nurture their peasants. The politically and \neconomically independent, clean living, poor, hard- \nworking American family farmers are increasingly \nreplaced by either complex businesses with assets in the \nmultimillion-dollar range or professional people living in \nthe country and operating part-time farms. In our con- \ndition of overproduction, neither of these stereotypes \nevokes much voter empathy. Most rural people are un- \nrelated to agriculture. \nUniversity Governance Dynamics. In earlier times, \nfledgling land-grant universities involved few people and \nirregular governance procedures. They were easily and \nsignificantly influenced by external political forces. As \nuniversities grow and mature, their internal governance \nprocess becomes more regular. A community of interest \ndevelops with its own dynamics and momentum. It is \nmuch less open to external political influence. In this set- \nting, agricultural colleges and departments within them \nbecome less linked to farm or rural issues and more \noriented to abstract science. \nAs these and other influences are studied, a consensus \nis growing that future political and economic events will \nbe less encouraging for agricultural programs than con- \nditions we have experienced over the past few decades. \nWe already have seen erosion in financial support for \nteaching, research, and extension. Enrollment is down. \nThere is every reason to believe that most agricultural pro- \ngrams, including agronomy and agricultural economics, \nwill not be supported in the future at the present level. \nUnless we can find a more useful product or service, our \nprofessions will experience major declines. \nA MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESPONSE \nDuring the first two-thirds of the 20th century, science \nand technology experienced growth, success, and many \nmajor accomplishments. The method of science was to \nfocus knowledge and attention on a (frequently small) \ncomponent or piece of a machine or system that was not \nworking properly. Basic science was often used to under- \nstand problematic relationships and design solutions to \nproblems. The improved component was then added to \nthe conventional system with the usual effect of improved \nsystem performance. \nIn the 1960s, Galbraith (1968) made the following \nobservations: \nSpecifically, there is no way that organized knowledge can \nbe brought to bear on the production of an automobile \nas a whole or even on the manufacture of a body or \nchassis. It can only be applied if the task is so subdivided \nthat it begins to be coterminous with some established area \nof scientific or engineering knowledge. Though metallur- \ngical knowledge cannot be applied to the manufacture of \nthe whole vehicle, it can be used in the design of the \ncooling system or engine block. While knowledge of \nmechanical engineering cannot be brought to bear on the \nmanufacture of the vehicle, it can be applied to the \nmachining of the crankshaft. . .Metallurgical knowledge \nis brought to bear not on steel but on the characteristics \nof special steels for particular functions, and chemistry \nnot on paints or plastics but on particular molecular struc- \ntures and their rearrangement. \nThere is no expression of concern relating to the process \nof integrating these improved components into the whole. \nThere is no problem where one improvement conflicts \nwith, or cancels, another. This mentality has given an \nenormous stimulus to the reductionist method of science. \nIt works well where the power of science to intelligently \nrearrange things is small and weak in relation to the \nsystems to which it is applied. As the power of science \nincreases, the problem of simultaneity emerges. Each \nchange must be considered in the context of other changes \nand feedbacks or side effects. This situation has led to \nthe evolution of systems analysis and holistic management \nin the last third of the 20th century. \nIn this newer pattern, the reductionist science con- \ntinues, but the context changes. Each participant has an \nawareness of changes or possibilities in other disciplines, \ntogether with knowledge of feedbacks and side effects. \nAs the power of science to intelligently rearrange things \nincreases, the need for understanding feedbacks, side ef- \nfects, simultaneous events in other disciplines, and the \ngeneral function of the system increases. Cars evolve im- \nproved aerodynamics, smaller engines, stiffer tires, and \nimproved suspension simultaneously. The smaller engines \nwould not work without the improved aerodynamics and \nlow-drag tires. The stiff tires are tolerable only with im- \nproved suspension. The selection, simultaneous develop- \nment, and integration of components for optimal system \neffects has moved from a nonissue a generation ago to \nthe center of the stage. \nIf this rationale is applied to the programs of agrono- \nmists and agricultural economists, how might it work? \nLets imagine that through some magic we were able to \neliminate all jargon-based barriers to communication, set \naside disciplinary chauvinism, and have unlimited insight. \nUnfortunately, my reaction is primitive and simple. It has \na common theme of management. The manifestations are \nsomewhat different at different levels. \nUNDERGRADUATEPROGRAMS \nThere is a large amount of turmoil in curriculum de- \nvelopment within agricultural economics. I think it grows \nfrom changes in the fundamental vision of what we are \ndoing. Traditionally, we have set about teaching students \nour specialties without much thought to how or where \nthey might use these skills. Farm management and com- \nmodity marketing were the early and continuing special- \nties, and others have been added. Today, we find this \npattern unsatisfactory. Placed in the context of a busi- \nness firm, these and other specialties lead to staff jobs- \nnot line or management jobs. Students are still interested \nin our specialties, but they want them to be placed in the \ncontext of business management. They want to be posi- \ntioned to flourish and advance in business firms. This \ngives us a dual priority-business management and tradi- \ntional agricultural economics subject matter. We are \nlearning that the students prioritize business management \nhigher than the traditional subjects. \nJ. Prod. Agric., Vol. 3, no. 2, 1990 171 \n', 'There are many ways to deal with this dual priority. \nCurrent developments in our department have led to the \ndefinition of an agribusiness block. This 18-h unit of work \nincludes basic learning in accounting, finance, leadership, \nmarketing, management, and systems analysis. Math, \ncomputer, and basic economics capability are prerequi- \nsites. We use this as part of a B.S. in agribusiness, but \nit is also set up to be available to students majoring in \nanimal science, agronomy, horticulture, etc. Another lev- \nel of the proposed B.S. in agribusiness is the specialty \narea. Specialty areas could be developed to provide tradi- \ntional agricultural subject matter (agronomy, horticul- \nture, animal science, etc.) in a management-oriented \ndegree. Therefore, this arrangement would allow putting \nsome management in traditional degree plans or putting \nsome traditional agricultural subject matter in a man- \nagement-oriented degree plan. \nSeveral departments of agricultural economics present \na nonscience master’s degree. These degree plans are often \ncentered on agribusiness management. The flexibility of \nthese arrangements often permits combining traditional \nsubject matter with management. \n/ \ncast of \nf W  \niw- \ndata may provide an indication of biological potential, \na commercial producer would never find it feasible to \nproduce at maximum output. Figure 1 shows this argu- \nment more precisely. Consider this as an example of two \ngenetically different test cultivars. Point 0 - h  is the level \nof cost for fixed input factors (land, ?water, etc.). Point \nh-p represents the sum of fixed costs and variable costs \n(N). This total cost increases linearly a.s units of the vari- \nable input are added. \nCultivars A and B respond slightly differently to differ- \nent levels of N. However, the response curves (output in \nequilibrium prices) are both tangent to the cost line at \nk.  This is the optimal output level for both cultivars be- \ncause costs per unit of output are minimized. Total yield \ncontinues going up from k to / (for Ciiltivar B), but this \nis wasteful because k-/ units of input gives only I-m out- \nput, whereas it would give /-n output in optimal condi- \ntions. The same is true for Cultivar A and output k-l’. \nThe higher total yield of A (at m ‘) as compared to B (at \nm )  is a false signal because it does not translate into a \nhigher optimal yield. It has the capability for more waste, \nbut not for more production under efficient management. \nOther Problems of Intensive Production. Higher yields \nmay increase vulnerability to diseases and parasites. In \ncases of forage production, this problem applies not only \nto the agronomic level of the system, but also to the \nlivestock level. It is astonishing how many ways exist to \ngrow more grass in Texas-and how few of them are \neconomically feasible (Conner and Chamberlain, 1985; \nVanTassell and Conner, 1986). \nSupply Response. Things that are hard to produce tend \nto be more expensive than things easy to produce. It fol- \nlows from this basic nature of things economic that as \nwe reduce production cost, price will decline. This is with \nno change in the basic quality of the product (Fig. 2). \nIn first equilibrium (Supply l), Quantity b brings price \na. When a new technology comes along, more produc- \ntion is brought to market. At the old price a, producers \nwould be willing to increase supply e-f, but that would \ndrive prices down to g. The resulting new equilibrium \n(Supply 2), is the production of c output at d price. The \ndecrease in output from f to h will probably result in some \nfarmers being forced into bankruptcy. They may feel that \nthe new technology ruined the market. Another result is \nthat our nation may compete better in a global economy. \nThe Case of Inelastic Demand. Where goods are \nalready inexpensive and in large supply, the total value \nof a large crop may be less than the value of a smaller \ncrop. This is because the lowered price necessary to move \nthe large crop into consumption subtracts more revenue \nthan is gained from the price received from the added \nunits. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 2 by comparing \nthe gained revenue (the rectangle bchi) with the lost \nrevenue (aeid). The value of technology to increase \nproduction in this circumstance requires consideration of \neffects on demand as well as cost effects. \nProducer vs. Consumer. The adoption of new technol- \nogy in food production or processing may have little \naffect on producers but be very beneficial to consumers. \nIn Fig. 2, consumer gain is represented by aehd, while \n172 J. Prod. Agric., Vol. 3, no. 2, 1990 \n', "producers' welfare change is more complex (kOhj-aejd),\nand frequently small or negative. These arguments can\nbe presented in many variations. The general theme is\nmost important, however. It is clear that biological improvements\nin maximum yields do not translate into\nproducer or public benefit on a one-for-one basis. At least\nthree implications must be drawn from this theme.\n1. There will be a need for disciplinary and multidisciplinary\nresearch for the forseeable future. One\ndoes not replace the other. Each makes the other\nmore important.\n2. Joint work involving agronomy and agricultural\neconomics can provide a basis for describing to the\npublic the benefits of biological research. A great\npart of the glamour of the events currently going\non in biological research will never be translated into\ncommercial processes because of the points identified\nabove.\n3. Policy concerning both traditional agricultural\ncommodities and the new biotechnology must be\nguided by an understanding of commercial realities.\nAgricultural economics must be prepared to translate\nchanging technology in agronomy (or other\ndisciplines) into commercial expectations as an instrument\nof policy analysis.\nSYSTEMS ANALYSIS/HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT\nThe people and rhetoric involved in the undergraduate\nand research patterns discussed above are usually quite\ndifferent. I want to assert, however, that I understand\nthe underlying cause of the fundamental accommodation\nSupply-1\nSupply-2\n/\nnew\ntechnology\n0 b e\nFig. 2. Consequences of adopting new technology.\nOutput\nto be very similar. In both cases, we are putting an\nanalytical process within a management context. The\nundergraduates know that the management process of importance\nto their career will most likely be a firm and\nthey want to know the way it works. Our research, if it\nis worthy at all, probes the basic pivot points of our civilization.\nThe management context here is public policy.\nWe must be prepared to help society understand the practical\neffects of new technologies. This understanding, or\nthe lack of it, will guide both how the public invests in\nresearch and how it uses the new technology.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIf agronomy and agricultural economics could harmonize\nour efforts perfectly, I doubt we could have the\neffect of reversing the forces causing change discussed\nabove. Our time in history conditions many of the environmental\ninfluences among which we pursue our dis-\nciplines. I do feel that we could achieve best results by\nworking more together. At the same time, the ideal pattern\nof interaction is a constructive blend of disciplinary\nand mutlidisciplinary work for both of our groups. The\nuncompromised pursuit of our sciences and the multidimensional\nprocess of managing our public and private\nenterprises are both worthy objectives.\nJ. Prod.
