Hills.\nTHE FIRST DUTY.\nWhile deploring apostolic Influence and church,\nrule and praying that Utah may become a real\nAmerican State, let us stop a moment and make\nsome calculations. Suppose the American party,\nunder present auspices, could succeed, accomplish\nall it has In view, and then an election was, to be\nheld, what then? Naturally the men who pledged\nlife, fortune and sacred honor, when the cause\nwas in swaddling bands, would be entitled to the\nfirst rewards, would they not? Wo all agree ?n\nthat certainly. Well, then, behind these sappers\nand miners the General who planned the cam\npaign would be entitled to the chlefest honor,\nwould he not? This being accepted, w,e find our\nselves In another fix. That general Is the same\nboss that he was four years ago when he first\nbeguiled the church into securing for him a United\nStates Senatorshlp, the same that he was three\nyears ago and two years ago and one year ago\nand this year up to about six months ago. When\nhe was boss before no one could gain official rec\nognition from him, except that he\' put on the\nbosses,\' badge and did his bidding. As the head\nof a great newspaper he did what he could to\nneutralize all the work that the paper had done\nfor thirty years to make Utah a real American\nState; he did what he could to make Apostle\nSmoot, Apostle Senator Reed Smoot; he kept the\ngreat newspaper sounding his own praises and\nconvincing the world that all the old heart-burnings\nin Utah had passed away except a little\nwhich was confined to the breasts of a few irrec\noncilables. Suddenly he awakened one morning to discos er\nthat, in his opinion, the apostle senator had not\nplayed \'fail. The apostle had agreed to ride and\ntie with him, but once in the saddle the apostle\nliked It. It was a now experience for him and\nhe forgot his agreement and determined to hence\nforth keep the steed in his own stable. Then this\nboss became angry and strangely enough his\nwrath took on the form of lofty patriotism and he\nbade his henchmen go out and beat the brush and\nmake the woods ring with Indignation, and to\ncall upon the people to come to the rescue of the\nold flag, to stand up while the "Star Spangled\nBanner" was being played, and to help to redeem,\nregenerate and disenthrall Utah and make It a\nreal American State.\nIf this wins he will naturally got over being\nmad, will he not, and become his natural self?\nBut If he does, will not the boss in his soul re-re-assart\nitself ? Why of course, and then Utah\'s last\nstate will be worse than the first, for surely boas\nrule, while It lasts is worse than church rule. When\nchurch rule has its\' way it gives tho glory to the\nLord, but when boss rule is on top, there are no\nconcessions, not even to God, the glory is all ap\npropriated close down to the. earth.\nAll this should be a reminder to the Eepub- \'IbH\nHcans of Utah that up to election day neither boss JiH\nrule nor church rule should be considered, but ,aH\nrather the election of officers, from the highest \'LbI\nunder the Federal Government down to the Con- , iHH\nstable on the city ticket. The effort, In IftH\nour opinion, of the original freedom shrlekers it faal\nto defeat the entire Republican ticket, that then iH\na new deal may be negotiated without any pro- H\nvoicing obstacles In the way. \'iH\nThe importance of the election can scarcely be HH\nestimated. The national issue is whether \' the H\nRepublic shall keep on its sublime way upward, rmH\nor whether a halt shall be called, its Industries \' j\nstopped and that part of the flag which has taken \'H\non new splendors of late shall be enough furled Lfl\nto cover up its new light. jH\nThe local issue is whether the state shall sLI\nbe given up to Democratic rule, with a Democratic ,\nGovernor, Member of Congress, Legislature and a j I\'fl\nlittle later a. Democratic Senator. Surely this ! jH\n\' ought to be of concernment enough to occupy all IH\nthe best thought and energies of Republicans for \'jsl\none month more. m1bh\nThere will be time enough for the consldera- yH\ntlon of other questions after this first business j\'lH\nshall be fixed. (H\nWHERE IT HURTS. Wk\nNo one doubts the fltne&ff of Col. Ferry for WM\nGovernor, or of Judge Hiles for Congress, or, SM\nfor that matter, the fitness of any candidate iH\nnamed by the new party convention. But the j\nnominations will not bo a strong Incentive for IH\nyoung Utah to take kindly to the new movement. jH\nIt Is a direct notice to them that the object is to \'Hsfl\ndefeat certain candidates L\'ecauge they are Mor- jH\nmons. There are a great many young Mormons Hsfl\nwho do not like church rule; who, could the mat- . jH\nter be left to a vote of the people, would vote all jH\nright, but with those men blood is thicker than jH\nwater. Many a man roared In the Catholic jH\nchurch has fallen from grace. But let any per- H\nson assail tho church in their presence and he 9H\nwill have a fight on his hands in a minute, It Is H\nclear that Judge Hiles was nominated with no ex- H\npaotation of being elected, but to take votes H\nenough away from Mr. Howall to elsct Judge Pow- H\ners. That fact will probably embitter every fl\nfriend and rolativo of Mb. Hawellg for life. It Is WM\nthe same way with every candidate named, ann H\nif tha result should be to cause a revulsion which H\nwould carry Utah for Parker and Davis, It would H\nbe almost a crime. H\nBut wa believe this very purpose was in the H\nmind of fcha man. wiho precipitated this movement, M\nHe has never liked the President since he re- H\nfused to summarily remove Postmaster Thomas jH\nwithout a hearing, over since the President In- H\nslsted that Perry Heath should get off the na- H', 'H 2 GOODWIN\'S WBHKLY.\nH tional Republican committee. For the calamity\nHR that the defeat of the Republican ticket would\nHk be to Utah, he cares not one cent. Ills undlsci-\nH plined soul reasons only to suit his Own desires,\nH to carry his own points. He reasons that he is\nH under no obligations to the party, that what he\nH has obtained in the way of honors, he obtained\nHK through his own skill and exertions, and the\nKf chances are ten to one that in his selfishness he\nH has reasoned out that he has been badly used, to\nHX he turned down after ail the work that he has\nHn done for his friends.\nH Hence every Republican should keep in mind\nH that a vote cast for any nominee of the American\nH party is in truth a vote cast for the Democrat who\nH frolds a corresponding nomination on the Demo-\nH cratic ticket If it is for Judge Hiles, it really is\nH for Judge Powers, if for Colonel Ferry it is a vote\nHj for Mr. Moyle. In the meantime the chances for\nH the state going for the Republican electors, are\nHB jeopardized, for in his zeal the angered voter will\nH not half the time care which heading is on the\nH ticket. he votes for, he will be thinking of nothing\nHH except to defeat the local Republican ticket.\nHB It is a time for Republicans to close up their\nH ranks and to move steadily upon both the old reg-\nH ulars of the Democracy and upon the volunteers\nfl who, under a new flag, have come upon the field\nM as the allies of the Demooracy. The wrongfulness\nH of springing this new party on the eve of election\nIB grows more and more apparent every day.\nHH When Messrs. Fairbanks and Dolliver reach\nH Salt Lake, the people may expect-to see two very\nH splendid men. Senator Fairbanks is a kindly,\ngenial man there is not a bit of the iceherg\nabout him, and he is a fine speaker. Senator Dolli\nver is the foremost campaign orator in the nation.\nHeisamassiveman and can make a dozen speeches\nin a day and not onoe repeat himself. He has a\nfund of humor in his .soul and when he comes\ndown to soiid reasoning it is an anvil chorus all\nthrough. Salt Lake people of all political persua\nsions will do themselves honor by honoring them.\nThey are both American products of the rarest\nvariety, it is a pleasure to meet and hear them.\nFairbanks is as tall as was Lincoln, Dolliver is as\ndeep and broad as Oliver P. Morton. They are\ngood men to meet.\nJOE\'S SOLILOQUY.\nUnited States Attorney Lippman has been a\ngood deal perturbed of late and has fallen into\nthe habit of talking to himself as he walks along\nthe street. A gentleman who followed close be\nhind him the other evening reported his soliloquy\nas follows:\n"O, but these are strenuous days, you bet. My\nhorseback riding experience was limited in my\nyouth and here I find myself called upon to be\nchief performer in a three-ring circus, and to act\nin all three rings at the same time. In the first\nplace, there is my Federal office. I know that 1\nwas selecbed for the place on my individual worth\nalone; that when the office came in search o! a\nproper tenant, it looked the field over dissatisfied\nand unsettled until it got its eye on me, and then\njust as Iole felt when ho first took in Hercules, it\nwas satisfied and said, \'whether he stands or sits\nor whatever thing he does, I am content.1\nv......v. . i\nI It fci " e are \'ntro(uc\'n9 ur 9?\nIm "AMERICAN\nH BEAUTY"-\nI $ JHL BEER W\nH HHIHI Which is the perfect m\nH\' &S IliHK embodiment of the best of m\nH $t UHH everything that goes to f\nH (JtS 513 make up this healthful Mr\nH & J$58K beverage. m\nW&W&j It isthe beer that stands ifi)\nXffi) as the best example of the\' gk\nlAnWRRFR brewer\'s art after years of\nH work and experience.

"Well, that office is worth keeping as long as\nI can hold on. It was for this I insisted that the\nlegend, \'for President and Vice-President, Theo\ndore Roosevelt and Charles Fairbanks,\' should be\nkept at the head of the editorial columns In the\nTribune. I did not give my real reason, but ex\nplained that the heading would beguile Republi\ncans Into the belief that the paper had still a\nlingering love for the \'Grand Old Party\' and I car\nried the point.\n"Then when I was called upon to lead in t\'ie\nreform movement to purify politics in Utah, and\ngive Tom another chance; that was a strenuous\nmovement sure enough, and when It became neces\nsary to pledge my life, fortune and sacred honor\non the principle, O, but that was tough.\n"I did not mind the life much because I am\nsomething of a fatalist and believe that a man\nwlli live out his time any way, unless he is hit by\na rattler ora vigilance committee.

Box 1074', 'GOODWIN\'S WEEKLY. 3 I\ngather up a fortune than it does to lose it, and it is\nso convenient a thing to have. My friends say\nI went through it all righf, but it was the worse\nbluft I ever played.\nAnd now the question is, how long can I stand\nthis? Of course the life I have lived helps me,\neverybody knows that 1 have been careless in\nmy ways and have never looked out much for my\nown interests, so they can easily believe in my\nhigh patriotism and the self-abnegation of my\nsoul in this matter, but how long I can stand it\nworries me more than people think. If the circu\nlation and the ads. fall off much in the Tribune,\nthere will be a deficit one of these days and then\nI shall have to call on Tom and I know what he\nwill say. He will declare that the scrub that ho\nimported and paid that mighty salary to, was with\nall his smirks and smiles a better manager than\nI have provied to be. Then men jibe me on the\nstreet and ask me when I first dropped on the fact\nthat Church influence was being used here, and\nhow it took so long for me to get mad.\n"The worst of all, people doubt my absolute\nsingleness of heart in this business and seem to\nbelieve that I was influenced by Tom.\n"I believe if I had my affairs settled up and\nhad my fortune in hand, I would jump the town,\nsavie my life If I could, and let the sacred honor\ngo to thunder."\nAt this point Joe turned into his own gate and\ngave it a dissatisfied slam as he went through.\nSENATOR HOAR.\nA great soul fled when that of the late Senator\nHoar took its flight.\nA great scholar, an orator that was some\ntimes equal to the very best, a broad-minded man\nwhose heart was big enough to take\nfn the suffering of all the world; a man devoted\nto duty, whose highest aspirations were to ban\nish ignorance and to secure a living generous\nwage to toilers; a man who loved lfis country\nwith a boundless patriotism, and wished its course\nonward and upward to never be obstructed, gen\ntle, courteous, manly always, an example of good\nevery day of his life the death of such a man\nis a national misfortune, a national loss.\nAnd he was always poor. All that he had at\nany time of his life was not equal to one day\'s\nIncome of some of our rich men. But the rich\nbowed down before his sovereign intelligence and\nmoral greatness, and wished in vain that their\nmoney could buy them the privilege of ascending\nto the plane on which he walked.\nIn his presence their wealth shrank to be mere\ndross, for he had within him that something\nwhich, shining out through his eyes and sounding\nout through his voice, made common men shrink\nwithin themselves as involuntarily they compared\nthemselves to him.\nAnd still he was not wholly great. The very\ngonerobity of his mind, its all-surrounding solici\ntude to make all the world better, blinded his eyes\nto the fact that there were people who claimed\nto iove liberty who knew not what it was, that\nsometimes a whole people should be put in a re\nform school, and so he made mistakes and unwill\ningly did injustice to some who saw more clearly\nChan he. But the splendor of his mind, the mar\nvelous integrity of his nature, the whiteness of\nhis soul will make the grief for him in his native\nstate intense, they will rate him with their very\ngreatest ones.\nTo them he will be as great as Sumner, as\nkindly as Andrew, more learned than Webster,\nas eloquent, at least at times, as Phillips; with\nhumanity as broad as Garrison a royal soul that\ncame to make the poor of the world happier, the\nrich better, the careless more patriotic, to bo an\nexample to all in all the virtues.\nLovingly and tearfully will they call his name\nand send their farewells after him, and some\nhailing his departed spirit wih say, "he has gone\nto join the great company of our nobility in the\nValhalla of the Beyond, and he will report that\nMassachusetts is still true to the ancient faith,\nthat she still leads in good worlds and high\nthoughts. God rest the true man\'s soul; he has\nearned the peace that has come to him.\nCAMPAIGN SIDELIGHTS.\nA correspondent of the New York Tribune evi\ndently does not believe very much in Judge Par\nker or his chances of success; ho says that had\nParker\'s managers in St. Louis been frank and\nhonest, had they explained just what Judge Par\nker\'s position was on all national issues, especially\nmoney, he believes that he would easily have been\nnominated and would have had the cordial support i\nof all factions of the Democratic party. But when\nhe kept a dead silence until after he was nomi\nnated and then fired his dispatch, after the dele\ngates were tired out and wanted to go home, and\nthere was no probability that the vote could be\nreconsidered, it had a most dishonorable look.\nAgain, his continued use of the phrase "safe and\nsound" is a direct insult to all Democrats who\nvoted for Mr. Bryan, and the correspondent be\nlieves that Mr. Parker will hear from that on elec\ntion day. He does not believe that Parker will\nreceive within 1,500,000 as many votes as Bryan\nreceived in either of his campaigns, and that\n-Roosevelt will have the largest majority, both pop\nular and electoral, than any president ever elected.\nIt certainly is strange that the eastern goldbug\npress continue to taunt the men who believed in\nand who still believe In silver as standard money.\nThe assumption of a lot of sophomore editors who\nnever studied at all the science of money, who\nknow nothing of the effect on the country when\nreal money is increased or decreased; their lordly\nassumption and their insolent tone which Beems\nto say "wisdom will die with us," would be a\nlittle hard to bear if we didn\'t all understand just\nhow much there Is in that crowd and on what\ngrounds they assume their superior wisdom\nCANDIDATE AND MANAGER.\n(From the N. Y. Tribune.)\nAccording to the New York Evening Post, the\nDemocratic Presidential candidate Is a "real man,\na figure of heroic "proportions, a man before he\nwas a candidate, with no armor but his honest\nthought, no skill but simple faith." Et cetera.\nAccording to the same New York Evening\nPost, the Democratic National Committee Chair\nman, who has been selected expressly to manage\nthis campaign, and who, presumably, was chosen\nbecause of his acceptability to and harmony with\nthe candidate, is "a man wholly without convic\ntions, he is for anything his party is for, he Is\nthoroughly unscrupulous in his poiitical methods."\nNow, how can two walk together unless they\nare agreed? If these two walk together and be\ncome agreed, is the good candidate going to con\nvert the wicked manager? Or will the wicked\nmanager corrupt the good candidate? It will be\ninteresting to watch the ethical conflict between\nthe Real Man, whoh as just done something of\nwhich it Is said that "nothing so fine Is known In\nour political annals," and his hand-in-glove comrade\nwho is "a man wholly without convictions" and\n\'thoroughly unscrupulous in his political methods."\nWo are not sure but that It will pretty nearly rival\nthe traditional impact between an irresistible\nforce and an immovable object.\nThat the Democrats have abandoned all hope\nof carrying Illinois is shown by the fact that they\nare sending Carl Schurz there to make speeches.\nJ.

Out of a total of forty-two, the\nH Gentiles have twenty-five and the Mormons only\nH seventeen nominees on the state, county and city\nH tickets. On the other hand, the Democrats give\nH the Gentiles a representation of eighteen, while\nm the remaining twenty-four nominees are Mor-\nHH mons. It will he observed that the ratio of Mor-\nH mons and Gentiles on the two tickets is almost\nWM exactly reversed.\nH Tho announced intention of the American party\n1 is to combat Mormons and Mormon Influence in\nH Utah politics, but they are using as a weapon to\nH achieve this result an organization which, if the\nH design of its originators is fulfllled, will defeat\nHH the Republican nominees, most of whom are Gen-\nHB tiles, and elect a ticket in the state and county on\nH which Mormon churchmen overwhelmingly pre-\nH dominate.\nHi As members of the American party confess that\nH the only way their influence can be perceptibly\nH felt in the present campftiea J by the defeat of the\nH Republican ticket, a few questions seem pertinent\nm in the present crisis:\n9H What advantage can Uiey gain by\nH the election of the Democratic ticket,\nH of which three-flfths are Mormons?\nH Would not the election of the Domo-\nB cratic ticket mean almost absolute\n1 Mormon control in the state offices,\nH. the legislature and the county?\n1 Where is the evidence of church in-\nWM fluence in the personnel of the Repub-\nHB. lican ticket?\nHH If such Influence were used in the\nBH Republican nominations, what is to be\nH said of the influence which dictated\nH the Democratic nominations, which\nK. give tine Mormons twenty-four of the\nB total nominations?\nJB Willi Mormons in control, in case\nm of Democratic success, who will be\nH the probable beneficiaries in the dls-\nH1 tribution of patronage?\nH If the Democratic legislative ticket\nH is successful, will not a Mormon Dem-\nH ocrat replaot a Gentile Rtpublioan in\nH the United States Senate?\nH And that being so, if Reed Smoot is\nH unseated, will he not be replaoed in\nH the Senate by a Mormon Democrat?\nIs it not practically certain that the\nreason the Democrats made O. W.\nPowers their nominee for Congress\nwas to give them a good excuse for\nmaking tho remaining congressional\nrepresentatives from this state Mor\nmon Democrats?\nAssuming that President Roosevelt\nwill be elected, would not the state, in\nthat case, present a bad y crippled\nfront to the administration?\nLastly, would not the American\nparty be playing into the hands of the\nMormons by electing the Mormon\nDemocratic tioket?\nThese are questions of vital importance to\nGentile Republicans. If they can be successfully\nmet and answered by Gentiles, then there will be\nsome palliation for voting the American party\nticket If not, the foliy of the inauguration of\ntho Independent Gentile movement at this time\nwill have been fully established.\nStill, the Populist, Socialist and Prohibition\nparties are still open to Mr. Cannon when he gets\nready to make another switch.\nIt is difficult to see how the nominees for dis\ntrict judges and district attorney are to be bene\nfited by the fact that no other names for tho of\nfice will appear on the American party ticket.\nThat fact might help a little, but as they prob\nably won\'t be voted for at all under the circum\nstances by loyal Americans, it is hard to see how\nthey are to run much ahead of the remainder of\nthe Republican ticket.\nIt would be too cruel to compare the present\nTribune editorials denouncing the Mormon\nchurch with the wheezling .pro-church exhala\ntions which appeared in its columns shortly after\nMr. Reams\' purchase of ihe senatorship.\nQhooy Lippman\'s position is slightly paradoxi\ncal. It is not the use of church influence but\nthe refusal to use it in his behalf that Ohoey Is\nreally opposed to.\nThe organ of the bolters hints with gusto that\ncertain nominees on the county ticket and one\nnominee on the Democratic stabe ticket are likely\nto insist upon the withdrawal of their names.\nThere may be nothing in the suggestion, but it is\nthe general opinion among politicians that the\nslate nominee referred to is Honorable O. W.\nPowers, the confidential adviser for the Tribune.\nMany who discussed the proposition considered\nit not unlikely that Mr. Powers would come to the\nTribune\'s rescue by an alliance with the American\nparty, provided his tour convinced him that he\nhad no chance to be elected Congressman. What\na paeon ot joy would issue from the bolting\norgan if ft could secure the distinguished ser\nvices of Mr. Powers for the Revenge Society.\nA large and (enthusiastic meeting of Repub\nlican women of Salt Lake county was held at the\nresidence of Mra. W. H. Jones yesterday after\nnoon. The principal speaker of the meeting was\nJudge C. W. Bowman, who spoka earnestly on\nreasons for supporting the Republican ticket. At\ntention was called to the campaign of 1896, when\nvoters debiting to vote for Bryan and the Repub\nlican ticket practically lost their vote by improper\nscratching. The meeting decided that the organ\nization should work in conjunction wtih the Re\npublican county committe and all Republican\nwomen were invited to call at headquarters in the\nAtlas block for any information pertaining to the\nissues or conduct of tho campaign.- It was further\ndecided to hold a meeting at the Woman\'s Re\npublican club rooms in the Atlas block on Thurs\nday, Oct. 13th, at 2:30 p. m. Tho president and\nsecretary of the club, Mrs. W. H. Jones, and Mrs.\nPowers, cordially extend to all Republican ladles\nan invitation to be present.\nA glance at the personnel of the Republican\nnnd Democratic tickets shows unequivocally the\nreal aim of the originators of the American party.\nThey are not fighting the Mormons, because they\nare assisting in the success of tho Mormon-Democratic\nticket. They are merely fighting the Re\npublican party.\nThe American party is counting upon gaining\nmany recruits from Gentile Republicans when the\nelection is over.

CUTLER AND HIS INTERESTS.\nIn the early days of Utah there journeyed\nacross the plains from the Missouri river a family\nconsisting of the father, mother and six children.\nThe trip was then slow and tedious. One of\ntho children, John C. Cutler, was then about 18 or\n19 years of age, and he drove an ox team, walk\ning most of the distance across the plains, while\n" his mother and the younger children rode In the\nwagon. Arriving in this valley the family settled\nin North Mill Creek, where with the-help of the\nboys they built a home. The first winter was se\nvere, but the boys made trips up into the can\nyons and cut cedar posts for fencing their farm\nand by spring thoy had the farm fenced In. John\nC. Cutler was an ambitious boy, and went to Salt\nLake, where he obtained a position as clerk in a\nstore in which he afterward became a member\nof the firm. About 1877 he decided to go into busi\nness on his own account and he then became agent\nof the Pjrovo Woolen Mills and entered upon an\nenergetic campaign for home industry of which he\nhats ever been an advocate. Besides being agent,\nhe is also one of the directors of the Provo Woolen\nMills Company. He is also a director and on the\nexecutive committee of the large sugar compan\nies of the state and Idaho; companies which will\nproduce this year millions of dollars\' worth of bu\ngar, and which have been so beneficial to the\nfarmers.\nMr. Cutler is also identified as a leading spirit\nin many of the other largest institutions of the\nstate. He is a director of the Deseret National\nBank, the Deseret Savings Bank, the First Na\ntional Bank of Murray, tho Home Fire Insurance\nCompany, the People\'s Co-op, Lehi, the Utah\nCounty Light and Power Company. Ho is one oi\nthe largest -employers of labor In the state, and\nthe many enterprises with which he is identified\nhave done much toward advancing Utah\'s inter\nests. Mr. Cutler has also served as vice-president of\nthe Commercial Club of Salt Lake, and vice-president\nfor Utah of the Trans-Mississippi Congress.\nHe served six years as County Clerk of Salt Lake\ncounty, and is now United States jury commis\nsioner. He is also one of the resident vice-presidents\nof the American Surety Company of New\nYork. He is one of the directors of the Deseret\nAgricultural and Manufacturing Society of Utah\nState Fair, which does so much to bring to the\nattention of the people of Utah the home manu\nfactured articles, and cattle and farm products in\nour state.\nTHE STATE FAIR.\nThe State Fair opens today. It is an event\nwhich every loyal Utahn looks forward to with\npride and pleasure. The products which have\nmade Utah great will be on exhibition; and it is\nan occasion when all citizenB who are interested\nin the welfare of the state can meet in a spirit of\nWHETHER a man gives much or little\nthought to his attire the world will\nv .

McCunc\'8 New Interests. j H\nLetters have ben received from Cerro de Pasco, f 1\nat the top of the Andes mountains In Peru, an- i jH\nnounclng the completion of the Oroya railroad, I H\nwhich has been called the greatest feat of engi- , j\nneering in the world. \' j -H\nTho cost has been high in the millions, and I H\nthe dflllcultiee overcome have been enormons. j H\nThe railroad from Callao to Lima has been in use M\nfor a long time, and that from Lima as far as \'M\nOroya for several years; the part from Oroya to \' M\nCerro de Pasco has been printed on all maps H\nfor years and written up and illustrated by the JH\nengineering magazines, but not till July 28, 1904, H\nwas the railroad to Cerro de Pasco finished, and M\nnot till August 29, 1904, did word reach San Fran- : !\' H\ncisco by mail of the arrival of the first train at H\nthe end, or top, of the road; of the driving of the \' H\nsilver spike in the presence of officials from Lima, , H\nand the great local celebration, when American, H\nEnglish and Peruvian festivities were combined. \' \' M\nEvory American thinks Cerro de Pasco a hard , H\nname, but as soon as told that Cerro means hill, \' I\nand Pasco is a common surname, and therefore ; H\nthe meaning is simply Pasco\'s hill, the name is j ,\neasy. It\'s name ought to mean higher than hill, \'H\nas the city Is 14,280 feet above sea level. Thou- j i\'jH\nsands of people live there, as it is the center of J vA\nthe richest mining country in tho world. Several , H\ncenturies ago an Indian shepherd camped for the H\nnight at this place. In the morning the stones on H\nwhich he had cooked his supper appeared to have \' H\nmelted and changed to silver. And since his dls- j ! fH\ncovery thousands of tons of silver have been \' j\nmined and carried away on the backs of llamas. 1 j\nC" 216 SOUTH MAIN ST.\nOur Conference Sale 1\nwill be the greatest \'event of the kind j\'H\nthat nas ever taken place in our store, I H\nand Suits, Hats, and all of the really j jH\ncorrect clothes for women, of which I fM\nour entire stock is made up, will be H\ndisplayed for your inspection.

H', 'H 6 GOODWIN\'S WEEKLY.\nm wish tho. old story wont & little further and said\nflH the shepherd\'s name was Pasco.\nH The railroad from Lima to Oerro de Pasco is\nH not\' a long one, being about three hundred miles\nB ill -length. But it is a miracle of accomplishment.\nB Tho mountains are among the steepest in the\nH world, the gorges are deep, the steel bridges nu-\nH merous. In one place five lines of parallel road\nB may be seen zigzagging up the mountain side.\nH Perhaps the most wonderful works are tho many\n1 tunnels, each one of which is a victory. The ser-\nB ies is marvelous.\nm One of the most thrilling experiences in the\nm world is a ride down the Andes mountains in a\nM handcar, a trip often taken for business and also\nm for adventure. At times only a short distance\nm ahead can be seen as the car shoots into tunnels\nM and twists suddenly around curves at a speed to\nm startle even the most daring. On one such occa-\nm sion the handcar, traveling at good speed, emerg-\nB ed from one of the tunnel and those in front saw\nB the up train so close that there was barely time\nH to roll off the car and pull the last man free be-\nH fore the engine demolished the empty car.\nH In one place the Galera tunnel pierces Mount\nH Meiggs, one of the loftiest mountains, at a point\nH 15.C45 feet high, the highest place in the world\nM whore a piston rod is moved by steam. And the\nm wonder seems even greater when one is told that\nH this height is reached in seventy-eight miles. At\nH such altitudes manual labor is extremely difficult,\nH even the natives of Peru finding it impossible to\nM do continuous work. They work a while, rest and\nH get their breath, and thon go on working. All\nH manual labor Is performed by natives of the class\nH called "cholos," Americans being at the head o\nH most departments. The foreigners suffer on ar-\nH rival from a sickness called "sirroche," severe\nIH i headache, nausea and weakness, caused by chang-\nIB ( ing to tho great altitude. And they live in dread\nH of pneumonia, which Is fatal in so rare an atmos-\ntm phere. On the first symptom of serious Illness,\njH American employes are taken hurriedly on tho\nH hard joruney to Lima, in the hope of recovery in\nH its mild climate and favorable altitude.\nH However, the climate of Cerro de Pasco is not\nH severe, as it lies only 10 degrees south of the\nH equator, and has a temperature of about 30 to 55\nH degrees, with rainy and dry seasons resembling\nH those of many parts of California. As Peru lies\nH south of the equator, it has winter in July and\nH summer In January.\nH This railroad begins in the dry climate of the\nH coast of Peru, passes through cultivated valleys,\nH which gradually become narrower, and soon\nH climbs to mountains showing the terraces made by\nH I the Aztecs, and still used for grazing. Then the\nm j gorges become narrower, and the mountains\nH I steep, bare and colorless. The road winds and\nB twists and tunnels In the most surprising ways\nH j and places, going up a steep grade all the time.\nH \' On a journey at any time during the last two\nH years one should have passed many gangs of\nM Qholo Indians, working on the grade, and living\nfl with their families in the caves along the road.\nH The men are small, only about 5 feet high, and\nH wear short, divided skirts, leggins and rawhide\nH shoes. The women are smaller and wear many\nB woolen skirts and\' some women go barefoot.\nM When not at work the men wear "ponchos," or\nM blankets, with a hole in tho middle through which\nH to put the head. The ponchos are not beautiful,\nB like the Indian and Mexican blankets. The natives\nB wear a handknit woolen oversleeve, which Is\nB quite decorative, being woven in barbaric designs.\nB Many Peruvians wear American clothes, or Amer-\nB lean trousers and Peruvian ponchos.\nB Besides all the obstacles of mountains and cli-\nB mate the fear of & revolution is an element of\nB anxiety to Americans living in Peru. The last\nB flurry came June 18, 1004, and caused great exclte-\nB ment. It started only a few miles from Cerro de\nBBflBBBBBBBBMBBBHBBHHI\nPasco. It was thus reported in a letter from\nthere:\n"At 6:30 o\'olock last night there came fugi\ntives telling of a battle at the railroad termlnuB,\nnow nine miles away, and telephone messages\nfor more soldiers, and news of death, pestilence\nand destructions. We all strapped on our trusty\nrevolvers, gathered our weeping families to our\nbreasts, swore allegiance to any old thing, lit\nlanterns, stood around and talked. Then nine\nmore soldiors camo down for slaughter, were piled\ninto a wagon and started off with a man in front\ncarrying a lantern.\n"When they were a half-hour gone, the local\nmoguls decided that there were 500 cholos at the\nseat of war, armed with artillery, cavalry, navy\nand lyddite guns, all expert shots, especially at\nnight, and that the army, the nine in the wagon,\nand the cavalry, four mules in harness, must be\nsent to a safe place, a mile and a half from the\nscene of carnage. An aide de camp was dis\npatched with a lantern to catch the charging\nforces, order them to a safe place, to sleep well,\nand to await new orders. I was that aide de camp,\nand accomplished my mission amid the dangers\nof darkness, bad roads, and a stumbling horse. 1\nreturned to find no glory, but a bunch of volun\nteers armed with Mausers, eager to have a few\nfree meals at the expense of the company. There\nhad been a row, as we learned next day, and one\nman had been killed. All that night we talked\nand guarded the Andes with one rifle and a lot of\nlittle revolvers. In the morning the volunteers\nand the generals went to the scene of action In\ncoaches and on a horse. Thus ended one South\nAmerican revolution."\nNames well known In San Francisco are con\nnected with this railroad and with the develop\nment of Peru. The road was begun by Henry\nMeiggs, and has often been called by his name.\nJames B. Haggln has furnished the money, a for\ntune in itself, for completing the road, which is\nnecessary In developing the great copper proper\nties. Frank Klepetko, formerly tho manager of the\ngreat Montana companies, has spent two years in\npreliminary work In Peru. The first work under\ntaken after tho Americans bought the copper\nmines was to build eighty miles of wagon road.\nUntil now all freighting has been done by llamas,\ndonkeys and bull trains, and the charges have\nbeen enormous.\nThe llamas arouse great curiosity and admira\ntion among strangers. They look gentle and pa\ntient. They are smarter than donkeys in one im\nportant respect; they know just how heavy their\nload ought to be, and if overloaded they kneel\ndown and refuse to get up till the loads are light\nened. Their thick wool, white, brown, black or\nspotted, is a saddle In Itself.\nThe new railroad will bring great changes to\nall Central Peru. The native methods of handling\nore Included digging It with hand tools from large\nopen holes, carrying It on their backs in rawhlde\nsacks to primitive measuring boxes, transporting\nIt on the backs of llamas, crushing It with huge\nstones quarried for the purpose, rejecting all ore\nof less than 25 per cent copper. These methods\nwill be in great contrast with those of the new\nAmerican smelter to be built in Cerro de Pasco\nand run by American metalluglsts.\nAs Cerro de Pasco had pianos, bicycles and\neven the most famous American breakfast food\nwhile waiting for the "railroad to get In," now It\nwill expect to have all the good things of earth.\nAlice L. Park, in the San Francisco Chronicle.\nJudge Parker recently showed his Ignorance\nof the common law in saying It was sufficient to\ncontrol the trusts. Does he know any more about\ninternational law? Or would he leave the Inter\npretation there to his advisors?\nI m LME lUEHTRri\n1 IbjF GEO. D. PYPER, Manager i\n" i\n( ONE WEEK BEGINNING\nMonday.
