The site of\nthe old stave mill seemed to be the\nbest suited and will probably be the\none that is recommended for the\nstation. It appears that the radio\nstations are now operated by the\ngovernment, and the one to be built\nhere will have to wait until funds\nhave been appropriated for same.

The earth then makes a new\nstart for one more revolution around\nthe sun. One revolution finished and\nanother begun.\nBy these revolutions of the earth\nwe count time. By the one arofurid\nthe sun we count the years and by\nthe one around her own axis\' we\ncount the days. These two move\xad\nments give us the idea of time. The\nflight of time! What is it then but\nthe flight of the earth in its double\nmovement!\nBut still, New Years Day is in the\nold world one of the greatest holi\xad\ndays. A whole nation is pausing in\nits toil and moil and gives itself for\n24 hours over to contemplations that\nstills the soul, and takes expression\nin many forms. A great hush is\nsettled over everything. All work\nis laid aside, i\'ts noise silenced.\nEverybody has donned, if possible,\nsomething new, furnished by the\nSanta Claus of Christmas a week ago.\nReligious people go together in\nprayer and meditation. Joyful peo\xad\nple hold their midnight wake and\nraise to their lips the foaming cham\xad\npagne, while the clock strikes the\nsolemn 12 strokes between the fled\nand the advancing year. The whole\nfollowing day, the first of the year,\nis celebrated by an endless repeating\nof "happy new year" phrase. People\nvisit one another to exchange the\ngood wish. Those who are holding\npositions go in evening dress and\nsilk hats to make their bow before\ntheir superiors, who in turn invite\nthem to a grand dinner. The chur\xad\nches have morning, high mass and\nvesper services and the theaters give\nnew plays, with motives for the sea\xad\nson.\nNew Years Day is by many con\xad\nsidered the holiday of holidays. It\nbelongs to all creeds^ In it is in\xad\nvolved only the idea of God. Christ,\nMohammed, Con Fu Tol, Brahma,\nBrigham, Young, Voliva, they all be\xad\nlong to groups or divisions of re\xad\nligion, and have their separate days\nand fetes. Thus not all people cele\xad\nbrate Christmas, but all may cele\xad\nbrate New Years, for that is the day\nof the Creator of materia and space\nand time. That is the day of the\nGod, who reigns over us alL\nLet us solemnise the day in a\nworthy manner, the whole human\nrace. Here is neutral ground, let us\nmeet there.\nGRAND MARAIS, CQOK COUNTY, MINN., JANUARY 14, 1920\nI. C.

The\nreceipts totaled $4,368,414 says Chief\nForester H. S- Graves in his annual\nreport just made public. To this\ntotal the grazing business contribu\xad\nted more than $2,600,000 and the re\xad\nceipts from timber were somewhat\nmore than $1,500,000.\nUnder act of Congress, nearly a\nmillion and a half dollars of Nation\xad\nal Forest receipts were truned over\nto the various states in which the\nForests are located, for school and\nroad purposes, during 1919.\nThe Rocky Mountain District of\nthe forest service contributed $705,\n738 of the total received from all\nNational Forests in the country, Of\nthis amount, receipts from the \'Nat\xad\nional Forests of the six states com\xad\nprising the District were as follows:\nColorado $460,195 Wyoming, $157,948\nSouth Dakota, $67,137 Nebraska,\n$14,404 Minnesota, 11,777, and Michi\xad\ngan $586.\nThat the receipts from grazing\nnow exceeds those from timber by\nmore than a million dollars and form\n59 per cent of the total receipts is\ndue, states the forester, to the fact\nthat practically the entire forage\ncrop of the National Forests can,\nunder present conditions, be utilized\nwhile the annuail timber cut is but\nan insignificant fraction of the sus\xad\ntained yield obtained from the for\xad\nests or the total cut of the country.\nWith the stockmen paying more\nthan two and ahalf million dollars\nannually into the public treasury for\nthe use of National Forest ranges,\nthere is strong reason for their urg\xad\ning an increase in Government ex\xad\npenditures to make the range more\nuseful to them.\nThe Forester pointed out that\nwhile the receipts for 1919 were 175\nper cent of those for 1915, the cost\nof operation has remained practically\nstationary. Some new fire funds\nwere appropriated but did not be\xad\ncome available until the last of July\nUnless higher salaries are paid the\nforesters and more money provided\nfor protection, the maintenance of\nan efficient organization will be im\npossable.\nSchool Departments:\nBoy Scouts.\nCamp Fire Girls.\nDomestic Science.\nLibrary Board\nOrchestras.\nLodges in the county:\nSamaritans.\nWoodmen.\nRoyal Neighbors.\nThe American Legion-\nSome of the ways money can be\nraised for the "Near East Relief\nFund".\nEntertainments, private, public or\nat schools*\nConcerts, private, public or at\nschools.\nMasquerade balls.\nMinstral Shows.\nFancy dress parties, grownrups or\nchildren.\nCard parties, private or public.\nDances, private or public.\nSocials.\nDebates.\nOld Time Concert\nTen-cent 5 o\'clock tea.\nFive-cent 10 o\'clock coffee parties.\nBasket socials.\nFood sales.\nBaby show.\nHome made candy sale.\nSalvation Army doughnut sale.\nHiking parties, and many more\nways, too numerous to mention.

FAIRBANKS\' NEW PHOTO\nPLAY ONE OF UNUSUAL MERIT\nOptimism, Humor and Exitement\nHappily Blende*} in Picture\n"He Comes Up Smiling"\nOptimism, humor, exitement and\nnovelty are the principal features of\nDouglas Fairbanks\' new photoplay,\n"He Comes Up Smiling", which will\nbe presented at the Princess theater\nnext Saturday and Monday evenings.\nThe farce upon which the picture is\nbased, was highly successful on the\nstage several years ago, but it is said\nthe screen version is even more satis\xad\nfactory to those Who like the ingred\xad\nients which have been provided by\nMii- Fairbanks in this splendid pro\xad\nduction.\nThe part of Jerry, who is known\nby the Knights of the road as "The\nWatermelon", is that of a young man\nwho has ambition, but who is in\xad\nclined to live a life of vagabondage.\nLured by the green wood and an\nirresis table desire to experience new\nsensations along the broad highway,\nJerry is a character which stands\nout distinctly as one of Mr. Fair\xad\nbanks\' most novel and enjoyable\nscreen characterizations.\nThe picture is filled with numer\xad\nous novel situations and the action\nis exceedingly rapid. Jerry chases a\ncanary bird over hill and dale, into\nhouses and over housetops he is in\nturn chased by a bevy of bees and lie\ndoes remarkable stunts in a wild\nautomobile driven across a mountain.\nThe role of the tramp is unique even\n\'in his record of unusual characteriz\xad\nations, but Mr. Fairbanks seems\nthoroughly at home therein.\nMarjorie Daw is Mr. Fairbanks\'\nleading woman and a remarkable list\nof players has been provided to in\xad\nterpret the other roles-\nRfVT/^QlA\n:,\\\n^ocrp-v\nNUMBER 32\nCounty Farm Bureau\nColumn\nEdited by County Agent\nDisposal of manure as fast as it is\nproduced in winter is advocated by\nM. J. Thompson, superintendent of\nthe Duluth sub-station of the Min\xad\nnesota department of agriculture.\nDouble handling is thus avoided.\nLosses by leaching are held to be\nslight. The Duluth district has deep\nsnow and low temperatures, but in\nfive years of livestock farming at the\nsub-station there has been no devia\xad\ntion from the rule of hauling the\nmanure to the fields promptly. Mr.\nThompson says:\n"The spreader is operated as late\nin the fall as possible. With the\ncoming of snow a rough box with\nrunners attached is placed at each\nbarn, the manure is dumped into it\nand in freezing weather it is hauled\nto the fields at once.\n"We manure the grain stubble\nwhere hay is to follow the coming\nseason-- This insures a good hay crop\neven though the year may be dry.\nThe manure is worked into the soil\nthoroughly- before the cultivated\ncrop follows in its turn. Likewise\nthe weed seeds are sprouted and out\nof the way with the hay crop. As\nnearly as possible we try to apply\nat the rate of two tons an acre a\nyear for each acre under the plow.\nThus in a five year rotation this\nwould mean ten tons per acre to\neach field applied once in five years."\nIRENE MARGERET GILBERTSON\nPASSED AWAY LAST WEEK\nIrene Margaret Gilbertson, daugh\xad\nter of Hans Gilbertson of Maple Hill,\ndied at the home of her sister, Mrs-.\nEngel Tormundson, of Red Cliff, last\nThursday from a combination of\nmeasles and broncho pneumonia.\nThe end came so suddenly that her\nfather, brothers and sisters living\nhere and on Maple Hill were unable\nto reach her bedside before she\npassed away.\nIrene was born on Maple Hill on\nMay 17, 1907, where her parents were\namong the early settlers, and where\nshe received her schooling and grew\nup to be a young girl.
