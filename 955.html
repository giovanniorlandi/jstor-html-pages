Over time, extensive tillage can have negative effects\non soil structure and microbial properties because soil is more prone to erosion when\naggregation is reduced, and aggregates provide necessary habitat for a healthy microbial\ncommunity. This 3-yr study compared two types of systems: One was an inten-\nsively tilled control where no cover crops were planted, and the other type of system\nincluded cover crops and only one tillage event per year. For this study, no-till is\ndefined as the pumpkin cash crop no-till planted into terminated cover crop residue.\nTreatments were a control (no-cover crop, and tilled ≥ twice annually); plus seven\nconservation treatments including either fall-planted or spring-planted cover crops.\nInfiltration, bulk density, wet aggregate stability, microbial biomass carbon (MBC)\nand dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were determined. The main soil physical property\nthat was affected by cover crops was an improvement in soil aggregation for\nthe conservation systems, while lesser effects were observed for water infiltration\nand bulk density. While these changes did not occur immediately, soil aggregation\nshowed differences between conservation treatments compared with the conventional\ncontrol. Therefore, we conclude that the use of less tillage and a cover crop in a conservation\nsystem is generally beneficial as compared with a conventional system.\nThis study illustrates the potential for improving some soil health parameters in as\nlittle as 2 yr.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nHorticultural vegetable production systems typically center\non high-value crops produced on small land areas with intenAbbreviations:\nBD, bulk density; DOC, dissolved organic carbon; MBC,\nmicrobial biomass carbon; MWD, mean weight diameter; SOC, soil organic\ncarbon; SOM, soil organic matter; WSA, water stable aggregate.\n© 2022 The Authors.

The economic and environmental\nadvantages of soil conservation measures, in combination\nwith various cover crops, has been well documented with\nfield and vegetable crops (Uri, 1999). Advantages include\nreduction of soil compaction, erosion, nutrient run-off, retention\nof soil moisture, increased water infiltration and weed\nSoil Sci. Soc. Am.

Merr.], wheat [Triticum aestivum L.], etc.) growers\nthroughout the United States. However, no-till practices for\nvegetable production in the central United States are relatively\nrare. Research in no-till practices for vegetable production\nwas conducted throughout several regions in the United States\nduring the 1990s (Hoyt et al., 1994; Morse, 1999) and as a\nresult, large land areas in Mid-Atlantic states such as Pennsylvania,\nVirginia, and Maryland have adopted no-till practices\nfor pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) and other large-seeded vegetable\ncrops. Large-seeded summer vegetables such as sweet\ncorn, snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and pumpkins are\nwell-suited for planting directly through mulch residues with\na no-till field corn or soybean planter (Abdul-Baki & Teasdale,\n1997; Mascianica et al., 1986; Mullins et al., 1988).\nIn addition to advancements in equipment, no-till vegetable\nproduction has become more accessible to growers by recent\nadvancements and labeling of herbicides for vegetable crops\n(Egel et al., 2012; Hoyt et al., 1994).\nPumpkin is a common vegetable crop that are frequently\nsold at local pumpkin patches and farmers markets, in addition\nto commercial production. In 2019, 27,599 ha were planted in\nthe United States, and the harvested crop was worth US$180\nmillion (USDA-NASS, 2020). Since 2016 the per capita consumption\nof pumpkin has been 2.7 kg in the United States\n(USDA-ERS, 2019). In 2017 pumpkin crops were grown on\n139 Kansas farms covering 303 ha, an increase from the 2012\nwhen 98 farms raised 204 ha of pumpkin in Kansas (USDANASS,\n2019). Although Kansas is not one of the largest\npumpkin-producing states, they are an important source of\nincome to the farmers that grow them, often in rotation after\nsoybean. Pumpkin crops are also a staple crop in agritourism\noperations and there were 409 farms registered in the state\nin 2020 (Kansas Tourism Division, 2021). Agritourism enterprises\nhave shown to benefit communities by connecting con-\nsumers with agriculture and help preserve farmland in rural\nand peri-urban communities (Che et al., 2005).\nHoyt, Monks, and Monaco (1994) reviewed the benefits\nand challenges of conservation tillage in vegetable production\nsystems. Soil and water conservation and labor-related parameters\nwere the most common benefits and weed and nutrient\nmanagement were among the disadvantages at the time of the\nreview. Tillage practices, residue cover, and cover crops can\nhave significant impacts on some of the most sensitive soil\nproperties almost immediately, while other properties (such\nas the soil organic matter [SOM]) may take several years to\nchange (Balesdent et al., 2000).Wind and water erosion can\nreduce soil quality and crop productivity through loss of nutrients\n(Al-Kaisi et al., 2009). Soil erosion also results in reduced\norganic matter levels (Fenton et al., 2005). Cover crops with\nCore Ideas\n∙ Three years of cover crops improved soil aggregation.\n∙ Presence of a cover crop was beneficial compared\nwith a no-cover crop, intensively tilled system.\n∙ Reduction in tillage and the addition of cover crops\nresulted in improved soil health.\nfibrous root systems such as cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) help\nto keep soil in place and reduce erosion from runoff (Locke\net al., 2015).\nCover crops are grown during the dormant period following\na cash crop and terminated before the planting of the\nnext crop (Hartwig & Ammon, 2002). Cover crops are not\na new idea; the USDA 1938 Yearbook of Agriculture refers\nto their use in maintaining SOM (Pieters & McKee, 1938).\nSweet clover (Meliotus spp.) was commonly grown prior to\nWorld War II as a green manure crop to provide nitrogen (N)\nto the soil prior to the production of N fertilizer (Sarrantonio\n& Gallandt, 2003). Cover crops used in no-till crop production\nsystems have been found to enhance soil physical proper-\nties such as improved water infiltration rates, reduced surface\nbulk density, increased soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration,\nand increased volumetric water content (Blanco-Canqui\net al., 2011; Haruna & Nkongolo, 2015). These improved\nphysical properties suggest that the use of cover crops may\nreduce soil susceptibility to compaction. Haruna and Nkongolo\n(2015) reported a 9% reduction in bulk density in the\n2nd year of using cereal rye as a cover crop in a no-till field.\nBlanco-Canqui et al. (2011) observed increased soil water\ncontent, increased infiltration, higher earthworm counts, and\nreduced soil temperature using sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea\nL.) and late-maturing soybean as a cover crop, as opposed to\na no-cover control. A study in California’s Sacramento Valley\nfound that either the use of common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) as\na single winter cover crop, or a mixture of oat (Avena sativa\nL.) and purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis L.), increased infiltration\ncompared with fallow treatments (Joyce et al., 2002).\nAccording to the Sustainable Agriculture Research and\nEducation, 2015–2016 Cover Crop Survey, 82% (994) of\nthe 1,219 respondents planted cereal rye as a cover crop\n(SARE, 2016). Cereal rye has been one of the most common\nfall-planted cover crops because the fibrous root system has\nthe ability to hold soil, reducing erosion, take up excess N\n(Brandi-Dohrn et al., 1997; Clark, 2008), and suppress weeds\n(Mischler et al., 2010).\nThere has been considerable interest recently concerning\nthe question of mixed vs. single species cover crops. Cover\ncrop mixtures are thought to increase the benefits from cover\n', 'DAVIS ET AL. 437\ncrop monocultures by offering diverse soil health benefits due\nto different plant types and rooting structures. Some observed\nbenefits to planting a cover crop containing multiple plant\nspecies include increased utilization of sunlight, water, and\nsoil nutrients through complementary rooting and growth\nstructures (Buck, 2013). By mixing different plant species\ninto a cover crop mix, producers could potentially use beneficial\nproperties of N2-fixing legumes, high biomass-producing\ngrasses, and N-scavenging brassicas.\nResearch comparing the benefits of cover crop mixtures to\nmonocultures is not extensive. Brennan et al. (2011) evaluated\nfive legume–rye mixtures, as well as rye alone, in a vegetable\nproduction system in California and measured aboveground\nbiomass and tissue C and N, but did not evaluate subsequent\neffects on soil health or vegetable yield (Brennan, et al., 2011).\nFinney et al. (2016) evaluated cover crop mixtures in relation\nto biomass production and ecosystem services in Penn-\nsylvania, finding cover crop mixtures did not produce greater\nbiomass than a high-yielding cover crop monoculture, indicating\nthat functional traits should be considered in addition\nto biomass alone (Finney et al., 2016).\nIn addition to the benefits of cover crops on soil aggregation\nand overall soil health, there is also potential for\ncover crops to influence a soils biological health. These\nchanges may be direct (nutrient resources) or indirect (altered\nsoil structure) leading to changes in the size, diversity, and\nfunctional capacity of the microbial community (Thies &\nGrossman, 2006). Dissolved organic nutrient pools such as\ndissolved organic carbon (DOC) can be increased by the addition\nof cover crops (Steenwerth & Belina, 2008) while oth-\ners have reported no effect (Strickland et al., 2019). Independent\nof the influence of cover crops, dissolved organic nutri-\nents such as DOC comprise a major portion of the total dissolved\nnutrient pool, and play a key role in a soils biogeo-\nchemical cycles (Jones & Willett, 2006). Microbial biomass\ncarbon (MBC) indirectly measures the size of the microbial\ncommunity and has been found to be both sensitive and insensitive\nto management changes. At the field-scale MBC and\nmicrobial biomass nitrogen (MBN) was not affected by the\npresence or absence of cover crops (Strickland et al., 2019).\nIn contrast, a study in Argentina found that cover crops in\nno-till sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production\nincreased soil MBC compared with treatments without a cover\ncrop (Frasier et al., 2016). Dinesh et al. (2009) observed more\nthan 50% greater MBC in soils with leguminous cover crops\nvs. a noncover cropped control, 12 yr after the study was initiated.\nSimilarly, Brennan and Acosta-Martinez (2017) found\nthat after 6 yr of intensive vegetable production with different\nOM inputs, resulting from different frequencies of cover crop\nand compost additions, MBC increased in all treatments with\nannual compost and cover crops.\nAlthough these benefits are important for long-term sustainability\nof crop yields and soil resources, the amount of\nland area in Kansas that is cover cropped is a small fraction,\nwith ≈225,000 hectares planted to cover crops out of ≈ 8 million\nhectares of cropland according to the most recent data\ncollected in the 2017 Census of Agriculture (USDA-NASS,\n2019). However, this is an increase from the 121,000 ha of\ncropland planted to cover crop for Kansas in 2012, thus cover\ncropping is a management practice that is gaining ground in\nKansas and many other states. To encourage wider adoption\nof this practice necessitates additional research to understand\nthe various effects on soil properties. This study is unique in\nthat it compares a twice-per-year tilled control system with\nonce-per-year tilled systems that used cover crops. Therefore,\nthis project is designed to compare systems, rather than individual\neffects of cover crops or tillage, so the treatments are\nreferred to as conservation systems. There are seven conservation\nsystems that used cover crops and were tilled only once\nper year, vs. the intensively tilled control that did not use cover\ncrops. The focus of this paper is to report the effects of a 3-yr\nproject on dynamic soil properties. The specific objectives of\nthis study were to evaluate changes in soil physical properties\nas well as microbial biomass and DOC in soil resulting from\nconservation systems in a horticultural production system and\ncompare these to a conventional control.\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Description of study sites\nReplicated research plots were planted at two research stations\nin eastern and south-central Kansas, (a) Kansas State\nUniversity Olathe Horticulture Center (38.90 N, −95.00 W,\n264 m asl), on a Kennebec silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed,\nsuperactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludoll); and (b) the John\nC. Pair Horticultural Center (near Haysville, KS, 37.52 N,\n−97.31 W, 378 m asl) on a Canadian-Waldeck fine sandy loam\nsoil (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Fluvaquentic\nHaplustoll). Both sites have humid continental climate with\nwarm summers. For brevity, these sites will be referred to as\nOlathe and Haysville for the remainder of the paper. The study\nbegan in fall 2012 and concluded with the 2015 harvest.\n2.2 Experimental design\nThere are eight management systems being compared in this\nstudy. One system is tilled twice per year and has no cover\ncrops. The seven remaining systems include cover crops and\nhalf as much tillage as the conventional control.\nTreatments included: (a) conventional system (control), (b)\ncereal rye, (c) cereal rye plus Austrian winter pea (Pisum\nsativum subsp. arvense), (d) cereal rye plus hairy vetch (Vicia\nvillosa Roth), (e) cereal rye plus canola (Brassica napus L.),\n', '438 DAVIS ET AL.\nT A B L E 1 Seeding rates for cover crops planted prior to pumpkin\nplanting in 2013,2014, and 2015\nTreatment\nCover crop seeding rates\nRye Oat Winter pea Vetch Canola\nkg ha–1\n1 – Control – – – – –\n2 – Rye 84 – – – –\n3 – Rye–pea 56 – 28 – –\n4 – Rye–vetch 56 – – 22 –\n5 – Rye–canola 56 – – – 6\n6 – Rye–canola–vetch 56 – – 22 6\n7 – Oat (spring) – 90 – – –\n8 – Oat–pea (spring) – 56 28 – –\n(f) cereal rye plus hairy vetch plus canola, (g) oat (Avena\nsativa L.), and (h) oat plus Austrian winter pea. All treatments\nwere replicated three times in a randomized complete block\ndesign (RCBD).\n2.3 Description of field management\nAll plots were tilled with a John Deere rototiller in October\n2012, then seeded with rye and rye-mixed cover crops. Cover\ncrops were seeded with a handheld rotary spreader, then incorporated\nwith a Brillion cultipacker (Landoll Corporation) to\nfirm the seed into the soil. The cover crops for Treatments 2–\n6 were planted each year in October, while the cover crops for\nTreatments 7 and 8 were planted each year in March (seeding\nrates given in Table 1).\nCover crops were terminated with a roller crimper (I&J\nManufacturing) each June, approximately 2 wk before pumpkin\nplanting. Following cover crop termination, pumpkins\n(cultivar Dependable) were planted by hand as seeds or\nseedlings directly into the soil following well-established\nplanting techniques (Table 2). Control plots were tilled both\nin fall and spring prior to pumpkin planting and cultivated\nthroughout the growing season. All cover crop plots were\ntilled just prior to planting of the cover crop. Each plot was 9.1\n× 18.3 m, containing three rows of pumpkin. Pumpkin crops\nwere irrigated and fertilizer was delivered at key times through\nthe irrigation system. The entire study area was watered and\nfertigated uniformly in accordance with the recommendation\nin the Cornell Pumpkin Production Guide (Riggs, 2003). Irrigation\nwas performed two to three times per week in Olathe\nand three to four times per week in Haysville. Irrigation was\nprovided on an as-needed basis by visually inspecting the field\nfor plant wilting, stunting, or other symptoms of plant stress.\nAt each of the study sites, soil health was assessed at two\nkey times; plots were sampled 2–3 wk after pumpkin planting,\nand immediately after pumpkin harvest. For brevity, only\ndata from the fall soil sampling is presented in this paper.\n2.4 Baseline soil characterization\nSoil samples were collected in fall 2012 to characterize the\nparticle size and SOC in general for the site. Fifteen soil\ncores from 0-to-15-cm soil layer were sampled randomly from\nacross the entire study area, composited into a plastic bag\nand transported to the Kansas State University Department of\nAgronomy Soil Testing Laboratory. Particle size analysis was\ndone by the pipette method (Gee & Bauder, 1986) to determine\nsoil texture. Soil organic C (note these soils do not con-\ntain free calcium carbonate) was determined by combustion\nwith LECO TruSpecCN analyzer (LECO Corp.).\n2.5 Cover crop biomass\nCover crop biomass was collected in June 2014 and 2015 (not\ncollected in 2013) by clipping 1 m2 area per plot after cover\ncrop termination and prior to pumpkin planting. Biomass was\nthen dried at 70 ˚C for at least 96 h to determine dry matter\nmass.\n2.6 Water stable aggregates\nWet-sieving procedures were used to determine water stable\naggregate (WSA) distributions of the 0-to-5-cm soil layer.\nSamples were collected post-harvest. Approximately 2 kg of\nsoil were collected from the top 5 cm of the soil from three\nrandom areas in each plot and placed into cloth bags and\nallowed to air dry. Once air dried, soil was sieved to collect\naggregates <8 mm and ≥4.75 mm in size to determine the\npercentage WSA. A subsample containing a minimum of 40 g\nof ≥4.75 mm aggregates was oven dried for a minimum of 48\nh at 105 ˚C to determine gravimetric water content. Size distribution\nof WSA was determined using a 50 g subsample of\nair-dried soil and a wet sieving method described by Kemper\nand Rosenau (1986) using a machine that moved four nests\nof sieves, each set in a separate compartment, through vertical\ndisplacement of 35 mm at 30 cycles min–1. Each nest\nof sieves contained five sieves of 127 mm diam. and 40-mm\ndepth with the following screen openings: 4.75, 2.00, 1.00,\n0.50, and 0.25 mm.\nThe air-dry aggregates were placed on the top sieve\n(4.75 mm), saturated with water for 10 min, and then mechanically\nsieved in water for 10 min. The soil remaining on each\nsieve after wet sieving was washed into pre-weighed glass jars\nand oven dried for a minimum of 48 h at 105 ˚C to obtain\n', 'DAVIS ET AL. 439\nT A B L E 2 Timeline of field operations.

The oven-dry soil was soaked for a minimum of\n24 h in a 13.9 g L−1 sodium hexametaphosphate solution to\nfacilitate the separation of coarse fragments from soil particles.\nThe dispersed samples were then washed through the\ncorresponding sieves to collect and account for coarse fragment\ncontent. Using the equation from Stone and Schlegel\n(2010), mean weight diameter (MWD) was calculated as\nshown:\nMWD = Σ (𝑖 = 1to6) (wi∕ma) xi\nwhere wi represents the oven-dry mass of aggregates xi represents\nthe mean diameter of each size fractions, ma is the total\ndry mass of aggregates. Water stable aggregate data is presented\nas the percentage of aggregates retained on each sieve,\nsum of aggregates retained on sieves (total aggregation), and\nthe MWD.\n2.7 Infiltration\nInfiltration was measured using the single ring\n(flooded/ponded) method as described in the NRCS Soil\nQuality Test Kit Guide (USDA-NRCS, 2008). A 25.25-cm\ndiam. ring was pounded into the soil to a depth of 7.62 cm\nusing a wooden block and a sledge hammer. A sheet of\nplastic wrap was placed over the ring and 2.5 cm of water\n(444 ml) was poured over the plastic. The plastic was gently\nremoved and the timer started. Each ring was timed until the\nsoil surface was glistening. Infiltration rate was calculated\nby dividing the minutes it took for 2.5 cm of water to\ninfiltrate.\n2.8 Bulk density and soil water content\nSamples were collected post-harvest. Samples were collected\nfrom one random location within each plot; dry bulk density\nwas determined using the core method (Blake & Hartge,\n1986). Using a slide hammer sampler (AMS Inc.), 5-cm diam.\nsamples were collected for 0-to-5- and 5-to-10-cm soil layers.\nSoil cores obtained were placed in airtight cans and the wet\nweight was determined the same day as collection. Samples\nwere then oven dried at 105 ˚C for a minimum of 48 h. Once\na constant mass was reached, bulk density and water content\nby mass were calculated.\n2.9 Microbial biomass carbon and\ndissolved organic carbon\nComposite soil samples were collected from each plot for\nMBC (Cabrera & Beare, 1993; Vance et al., 1987) and DOC\nanalyses using a single 0.5 M K2SO4 extraction method (Jones\n& Willett, 2006). Soil cores (0-to-15-cm depth and 2.5 cm\ndiam.) were collected from 15 random locations within each\nplot post-harvest using aseptic techniques and composited.\nAfter collection samples were placed in plastic bags and\nstored in a cooler with ice packs during transport and then\nin a refrigerator at 4 ˚C. All samples were processed through\na 2 mm sieve (W.S. Tyler Industrial Group) at field moisture\nto achieve homogeneity. Soil (8 g) was weighed in duplicate\ninto 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. One set of flasks was fumigated\nwith chloroform for 24 h under vacuum in a desicca-\ntor lined with moist paper towels to maintain humidity prior\nto extraction. All samples were extracted by adding 40 ml\n', '440 DAVIS ET AL.\n0.5 M K2SO4 shaking for 30 min at slow speed on an oscillating\nshaker (Eberbach Corporation), and filtering through\nWhatman 42 filter paperas described by Cabrera and Beare\n(1993). Filtrate was stored at 4 oC until analyzed for C using\na Total Organic Carbon analyzer (Shimadzu Corporation).\nThe instrument was calibrated with standards and accuracy\nwas verified throughout the run with standards analyzed as\nunknowns. To account for C in the filter paper, a blank was run\nwith each extraction set (unfumigated) and each desiccator\n(fumigated). Microbial biomass was calculated from the difference\nbetween C in the fumigated and unfumigated samples\nand expressed per gram of dry soil (Cabrera & Beare, 1993;\nVance et al., 1987). Dissolved organic C was determined to\nbe the C measured in the unfumigated samples expressed per\ngram dry soil (Jones & Willett, 2006).\n2.10 Statistical analysis\nThe plots were arranged in a RCBD with three blocks, with\neach treatment occurring once per block. Statistical analysis\nwas completed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) with the\nProc Mixed procedure. Initially, a three-way analysis of variance\nanalysis was considered with year, location, and treat-\nment as fixed factors, and block as the random factor. Due to\nthe large number of instances of interactions between year and\nlocation, as well as difference in soil texture and precipitation\nbetween locations the decision was made to analyze each location\nand year as individual snap shots in time. Thus, all data\nanalysis presented was performed using a one-way analysis of\nvariance by location and year, with treatment as the fixed factor\nand block as the random factor. Means were separated at\na least significance of .10. Values shown in tables and figures\nare arithmetic means. Soil properties will be discussed by year\nand site (first for Olathe, and then for Haysville).\n3 RESULTS\nThe soil at the Olathe site was a silt loam (18% sand, 60%\nsilt, and 22% clay) and 2.2 % SOC. The soil at the Haysville\nsite was a loamy sand (82% sand, 8% silt, 10% clay) with\n1.0 % SOC. Precipitation was characterized as a wetter-thannormal\nat both site locations in 2013, the 1st year of the study\n(Table 3). Precipitation was drier-than-normal at both sites in\n2014 and Haysville in 2015 (Table 3). Precipitation at Olathe\nin 2015 was similar to the 10-yr normal precipitation (Table 3)\n3.1 Cover crop biomass\nCover crop biomass production differed at both sites from\n2014 to 2015 (Table 4). At Olathe in 2014, the systems\nF I G U R E 1 Olathe aggregate size distribution comparison\nbetween cover crop and control treatments. Treatments with different\nletters indicate significant differences at the P = .1 level.\nwith rye–vetch–canola and oat produced more biomass than\nrye and rye–canola containing systems with the other treatments,\nranking intermediate (P = .01). At Haysville in 2014,\nthe systems with oat and oat–pea produced more biomass\nthan the systems with rye, rye–vetch, rye–canola, rye–vetch–\ncanola, with the exception of rye–pea, which was intermediate\n(P = .01; Table 4). In 2015, there were no differences\nin cover crop biomass between the systems when compared\namong individual treatments (Table 4).\n3.2 Wet aggregate stability\nThe fall 2013 sampling period took place 1 yr after the management\nsystems were introduced at these locations. For the\nfall 2013 sampling there were no differences between treatments\nfor any of the size fractions, total aggregation, or MWD\nat either site location (Figures 1 and 2; Tables 5 and 6).\nFall 2014 was the first instance that differences in WSA\nwere measured at the Olathe site. On average, the systems\nthat included cover crops (2–8) had a greater fraction of\nlarge aggregates in the >4.75 mm and 1–2 mm size fractions,\nas well as total aggregation. Conversely, the control\nTreatment (1) contained a greater proportion of the smallest\naggregate fraction, 0.25 to 0.5 mm, and non-aggregated\nmaterial <0.25 mm in size (Figure 1).

The BD ranged from\n1.29 to 1.40 g cm–3 at Olathe for the silt loam soil, and the\nBD ranged from 1.27 to 1.39 g cm–3 for the loamy sand\nsoil.\nAt Olathe in fall 2014 there were no effects of treatment on\nthe 0–5 or 5–10 cm BD, but there was a difference in BD at\nthe 5-to-10-cm layer between control with 1.13 g cm–3 and\nthe average of the conservation Treatments 2–8 with 1.25 g\ncm–3 (P = .07), which is the opposite of what we might have\nexpected to occur (Table 7). At Haysville in fall 2014, there\nwere no differences among treatments (Table 8) and there\nwere no differences between the average of all the conservation\nsystems and the control at either layer.\nAt Olathe in fall 2015 there were no differences in BD\nbetween any of the treatments at either the 0-to-5- or 5-to10-cm\nlayer (Table 9). At Haysville in fall 2015, comparing\namong individual treatments, there were differences in the 0to-5-cm\nlayer (P = .07); the control (Treatment 1) and the\noat (Treatment 7) and oat–pea (Treatment 8) treatments had\ngreater BD than either the rye–canola (Treatment 5), or rye\n(Treatment 2) treatments.

Similar to Olathe there were no differences in\nDOC at Haysville between control and average of all the conservation\nsystems (Table 6); however, there were differences\namong treatments for DOC (Table 6). The rye Treatment (2)\ncontained the most DOC, the control (1) contained the least,\nand the other treatments were intermediate (P = .09).\nAt Olathe in fall 2014 there were no differences in MBC or\nDOC when comparing the average of conservation systems to\ncontrol, or when comparing individual treatments (Table 7).\nAt Haysville in fall 2014 there were no differences in MBC,\nand the only difference was that DOC was greater for the average\nof conservation systems (2–8) than control with 25.0 vs.\n22.1 mg C kg–1 dry soil (P = .09) (Table 8).\nAt Olathe in fall 2015 there were no differences in MBC or\nDOC (Table 9). At Haysville in fall 2015 there were no differences\nin MBC but DOC was greater averaged across conser-\nvation Treatments 2–8 than the control (P = .04) (Table 10).\nAmong the individual treatments at Haysville in fall 2015\nTreatment 6, rye–vetch–canola, contained the most DOC and\nwas statistically greater than the rye (Treatment 2), oat (Treatment\n7) , oat–pea (Treatment 8), and control (Treatment 1)\ntreatments (P = .05) (Table 10).\n4 DISCUSSION\nThe main soil physical property that was affected by management\nsystems used in this study was an improvement with\nthe use of conservation systems in total soil aggregation and\nvery large aggregates >4.75 mm, while lesser effects were\nobserved for water infiltration and BD. Although statistical\n', '446 DAVIS ET AL.\nanalyses were performed independently for each site-year, it\nappears that soil aggregation changed over the duration of this\nstudy at both sites. While these changes did not occur immediately,\nsoil aggregation improved for conservation systems\ncompared with the conventional control. Conservation treatments\nbegan in fall 2012 but differences between the con-\ntrol and conservation systems were not statistically significant\nuntil the fall 2014 sampling period. These differences continued\nto become more pronounced at both sites throughout the\nremainder of the study.\nOur results support those by Piper et al. (2015) who\nreported a similar increase in total and very large water stable\naggregates over time, finding cover crops with strip tillage\nresulted in significantly increased soil wet aggregate stability\nover cover crops with conventional tillage in the 2nd and\n3rd years of the study. In semi-arid, irrigated systems, Antosh\net al. (2020) demonstrated that cover crops improved aggregate\nstability after 2 yr of implementation; resulting in a 17\nand 27% increase in wet aggregate stability under mustard\n(Brassica spp.) and mustard–vetch cover crops, respectively.\nThe authors attributed the aggregate stability improvements\nto indirect effects from the cover crop growth (Antosh et al.,\n2020).\nDespite the differences in water stable aggregation, particularly\nin the largest size fraction, there were no differences in\nponded water infiltration. A recent review by Blanco and Ruis\n(2020) summarized the effects of cover crops on infiltration,\nfinding infiltration rate or cumulative infiltration increased\nin 14 of 17 studies, while cover crops decreased infiltration\nin one study and had no effect in two studies. Blanco\nand Ruis (2020) notes that pore size distribution is slow to\nchange, and infiltration will not improve until other properties\nsuch as aggregation and porosity increase, and macropores are\nimportant for ponded infiltration where gravity is the primary\nforce. Cameira et al. (2003) found that silt loam soil managed\nwith minimal tillage had greater saturated conductivities\ncompared with that managed with conventional tillage. Since\nall of the treatments were tilled each year in the fall, macropores\nmay not have had time to develop before tillage occurred\nagain.\nSoil BD did not differ among treatments for most of the\nsampling periods at either site. The Haysville fall 2015 sampling\nperiod was the exception; differences were present at\nboth 0-to-5- and 5-to-10-cm layers in fall 2015 with a lower\nsoil BD in the cover crop treatments compared with control\n(Table 10). According to the USDA-NRCS (2008), the\nideal BD for a silt loam is <1.40, the BD that would affect\nroot growth is 1.55, and the root-restricting value is >1.65 g\ncm–3, respectively. For a loamy sand textured soil the corresponding\nvalues are <1.60, 1.69, and >1.80 g cm–3, respec-\ntively (USDA-NRCS, 2008). The values measured in this\nstudy were always equal to or less than the ideal level, particularly\nfor Haysville. At Olathe there were several mean\nvalues that approached the 1.40 g cm–3 level-cutoff for the\nideal range. Several wheel ruts were observed at Olathe when\nsoil sampling occurred, likely from tractors that were used\nto terminate the cover crops. Care was taken to collect soil\nsamples outside of the wheel ruts. No ruts were observed at\nHaysville.\nSoil texture, management differences, and initial SOC concentrations\nbetween locations contributed to contrasting soil\nDOC concentrations at our two sites. Olathe had a higher initial\nSOC and consistently had a higher mean DOC concentra-\ntion; however, no detectable changes occurred from the reduction\nin tillage and the addition of a cover crop. In contrast,\nHaysville had a lower initial SOC and mean DOC concentration\ndid respond to the reduction in tillage and the addition of\ncover crops. At Haysville, the concentration of DOC increased\nin the cover crop treatments compared with the control in 2014\nand 2015. Similar results have been reported by Pieper et al.\n(2015), who reported that active or labile C was only different\namong treatments in the 3rd year, and microbial activity\n(Solvita Soil CO2 respiration kit, Woods End Laboratories)\nwas generally greater for the reduced tillage treatments, all\nof which had cover crops, than the noncover cropped, highly\ntilled, control.\nMicrobial biomass based on the quantification of C in the\nmicrobial community (bacteria and fungi) was not sensitive\nto the management systems. Nair and Ngouajio (2012) also\nfound in a 3-yr study of organic vegetable production systems\nthat cover crops alone did not change microbial biomass\nand that it was only when compost was added to the system\nwith a high-residue rye cover crop that they detected a\nchange in MBC. It was speculated that the combination of\ncompost and a high residue cover crop provided high quality\nC inputs that supported a larger microbial community (Nair\n& Ngouajio, 2012). Brennan and Acosta-Martinez (2017)\nreported an increase in MBC after 6 yr in an intensive vegetable\nproduction system utilizing cover crops and receiv-\ning compost. The control system (no compost + legume–\nrye cover crop in the 4th year) resulted in a decline in\nMBC while the compost + cover crop treatments increased\nMBC.\nThis study was conducted with plots in place for 3 yr\nof continuous pumpkin production, while typically, horticultural\nproducers use a crop rotation. Although this study\nused some mixed-species cover crop combinations, it did\nnot quantify the cover crop species composition or how\nthat may have changed throughout the growing season. For\nexample, some cover crop mixtures are frequently planted\nby taking the monoculture planting rate and dividing it by\nthe number of species planted in mix (Bybee-Finley et al.,\n2016). More research is needed to know if this is a good\nmethod for determining planting rates and if competition\nbetween species negates the benefits of a mixed species cover\ncrop.\n', 'DAVIS ET AL. 447\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nAdding cover crops and reducing tillage in a pumpkin production\nsystem can begin to cause a measurable change in\nsoil aggregation in a short period of time, 2 yr in this study.\nDespite the differences in aggregates, and particularly the\npresence of more large aggregates >4.75 mm in diameter,\nthe ponded infiltration rate was not affected by cover crop\ntreatments. This may be due to the fact that all plots are\ntilled after the pumpkin harvest each year, and thus, long,\ncontinuous macropores may not be forming. The microbial\nmeasurements also did not produce a consistent trend among\ntreatments and sampling intervals. At the beginning of the\nstudy, it appeared that soil physical properties in the treatments\ncontaining fall-planted cover crops improved quicker\nthan the spring-planted cover crops; however, as the study\nwent on, this difference became less significant. There were\nfew instances where the species or mixture of species influenced\nthe results but rather, the presence of cover crops in\nthe conservation systems appears to have a more dominant\nrole. The significance of this work is that it demonstrated\nthat there can be measurable changes in some dynamic soil\nproperties in the short term (2 yr) in a system that involves\na reduction in tillage operations and the addition of cover\ncrops.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nThe authors wish to sincerely thank: Kimberly Oxley,\nRichard Ryer, the Olathe Horticulture Center, and the\nJohn C.
