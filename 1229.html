Wright:\n"I wish to express to you and\nthrough you to the officers and men\nof the First and Second South Carolina\nInfantry regiments my high appreciation\nof the team work, discipline\nand stamina displayed during the\nmarch of the provisional division to\nLas Cruces and return, these high soldierly\nqualities were very noticeable\nand contributed much to the success of\nthe march."\nThe South Carolina regiments were\nnut into a provisional brigade with a\nregiment from Michigan for the hike,\ntwo Southern and one Northern regi- i\nment. Though physically and temperamentally\ndifferent and never having I\nserved together before this hike, they |\nwere quickly made into a concrete and j\neffective organization due to the superior\ndiscipline of the brigade commander\nand the untiring effort of the\nofficers and men.\nIt is said that when the division\nwas to start orders had been Issued\nas to the starting time of each brigade\nand that of all the live that of Soutti\nCarolina was the only one to more\nin the exact time, and because Col.\nWright had previously ascertained the\n^xact distance from his camp and j\ncleared a certain point. Other bri- j\ngades got choked in the passage be- I\nause they had a tendency to start\nahead of time and caused some con- i\nfusion.\nGreat praise was given by the Inspectors\nof the work of the entire division,\nbut South Carolina, as usual,\n\' ame out with first honors. The bri- !\n-ado well officered and the men well I\nrained made a flno showing on the\n\'ong march.
