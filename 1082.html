        <pre>['Navigating Without Road Maps: The Early Business of \nAutomobile Route Guide Publishing in the United States \nJohn T. Bauera\na Department of Geography, University of Nebraska at Kearney, Kearney, Nebraska, USA; bauerjt@unk.edu \nAbstract: In the United States, automobile route guides were important precursors to the road maps that Americans are \nfamiliar with today. Listing turn-by-turn directions between cities, they helped drivers navigate unmarked, local roads. \nThis paper examines the early business of route guide publishing through the Official Automobile Blue Book series of \nguides. It focuses specifically on the expansion, contraction, and eventual decline of the Blue Book publishing empire \nand also the work of professional “pathfinders” that formed the company’s data-gathering infrastructure. Be- ginning in \n1901 with only one volume, the series steadily grew until 1920, when thirteen volumes were required to record \nthousands of routes throughout the country. Bankruptcy and corporate restructuring in 1921 forced the publishers to \ncondense the guide into a four-volume set in 1922. Competition from emerging sheet maps, along with the nationwide \nstandardization of highway numbers, pushed a switch to an atlas format in 1926. Blue Books, however, could not \nremain competitive and disappeared after 1937. “Pathfinders” were employed by the publishers and equipped with \nreliable automobiles. Soon they developed a shorthand notation system for recording field notes and efficiently \nincorporating them into the development workflow. Although pathfinders did not call themselves cartographers, they \nwere geographical data field collectors and considered their work to be an “art and a science,” much the same as \nmodern-day cartographers. The paper concludes with some comments about the place of route guides in the history of \nAmerican commercial cartography and draws some parallels between “pathfinders” and the digital road mappers of \ntoday. \nKeywords: Route guide, Automobile Blue Book, Road map \n1. Introduction\nAt the dawn of the twentieth century it was difficult to \ntravel long distances in an automobile because maps \nappropriate for this new form of transportation were \nscarce. The locally based mental map that people \nacquired through experience served well for navigating \nwith horse and buggy. When someone wanted to travel \nfarther than a day’s carriage ride, they boarded a \npassenger train and the railroad navigated for them. But \nwith an automobile, people had the ability to travel long \ndistances on their own, without railroads. Their mental \nmap, though, was insufficient for navigating areas far \nfrom home. So without road maps, how did automobile \ndrivers know what roads to take? What directions did \nthey travel? Where did they turn? \nAn early solution to this navigation problem were \nautomobile route guides. Listing turn-by-turn directions \nbetween cities, they allowed early drivers to navigate \nnetworks of unmarked, local roads. Thus, in the United \nStates, automobile route guides were important \nprecursors to the road maps that Americans are familiar \nwith today (Bauer 2009). Few researchers have analyzed \ntheir roles in the history of cartography. Although many \nroute guides were marketed during the first decades of the \ncentury, the Official Automobile Blue Book series was by \nfar the most widely used and successful. It remained in \npublication for nearly forty years and was one of only \ntwo guide series to cover the entire United States. \nThis paper examines the early business of route guide \npublishing by examining the expansion, contraction, and \neventual decline of the Blue Book publishing empire as \nwell as the work of professional “pathfinders” that \nformed the company’s data-gathering infrastructure. \nPrimary sources include forty-four volumes of the guide \npublished between 1901 and 1937, period newspaper \nstories, technical articles from early automobile trade \nmagazines, and United States court records. \n2. The Official Automobile Blue Book\nThe Official Automobile Blue Book was published as a \nmultivolume series from 1901 until at least 1937. In Blue \nBooks, geographical information was not recorded and \ntransmitted in a cartographic format, but rather in a \ntextual format, written as turn-by-turn directions. Single \nvolumes in the series often contained over 500 separate \nroutes, re- quiring 600 pages or more of description. \nBecause of the textual format, each physical route had to \nbe described twice, once in each direction. The forward \nand reverse versions of each route consisted of the same \nlandmarks and turns, only the directions were reversed. \nEven though users navigated with the written directions, \nsimplistic maps were still included in the books. Highly \ngeneralized maps served as indexes to the routes and \nsupplements in urban areas. Each route segment was \nlabeled with an identification number which referred the \nuser to the associated text about that segment. \nSupplemental maps of major urban areas helped travelers \nfollow routes through cities and showed connecting \nProceedings of the International Cartographic Association, 1, 2017.

Routes began and ended at \nmajor road intersections in the central business district, \ntypically adjacent to the county courthouse, railroad \ndepot, or other prominent landmark. \nFigure 1 shows an index map, urban map, and route \ndirections from the 1910 Middle West volume 4. Route \n51 connects Bloomington, Illinois with Chicago, Illinois \nand is 148.4 miles (238.8 km) long. The entire route \ncomprises sixty-five individual segments and requires \nalmost four pages of text to describe. A brief description \nof the road conditions appears at the beginning. \nCentral to the guide’s wayfinding narrative is the use of \ntotal and intermediate distances. The distance, in miles, of \neach turn in the directions from the beginning of the \nroute, plus the distance from the previous turn, is listed \nalong the left-hand side of the route log. Users reset their \nodometers to zero or kept a pencil and paper handy so \nthey could keep track of distances and intermediate \nmileages. \nIn addition to distances, landmarks are also at the heart of \nthe route guide’s narrative. Not only did prominent \nlandmarks identify the beginning and end of routes, they \nidentified individual turns or segments along the route. \nMost commonly these intermediate landmarks were \nrailroad tracks and power/telephone poles. For example, \nRoute 51 references railroad tracks thirty-three times \nwithin its sixty-five segments. Other common landmarks \nwere buildings, bridges, businesses, trolley tracks, and \nparks, including fairgrounds and cemeteries. Compass \ndirections were rarely used in any of the route segments. \nThis reliance on written directions with mileages, \nlandmarks, and turns made navigation with the Blue \nBooks difficult and was cited by map historian James \nAkerman as the route guide’s chief flaw (1993). Without \ndetailed maps keyed to markings on the ground, routes \nneeded to be flawless and tourists had to follow them \nprecisely. It is easy to envision any number of scenarios \nwhere a tourist finds themselves off the route. In these \nsituations they would have to retrace their path until they \nencountered a familiar place earlier on the route or search \nout an alternative. \n2.1 C.H. Gillette and the Class Journal Years \nThe Official Automobile Blue Book was founded by \nCharles Howard Gillette, a prominent businessman from \nHart- ford, Connecticut (Hart 1919). In 1901 he \nincorporated the Official Automobile Blue Book \nCompany in Newark, New Jersey with $3,000 of capital \n(The Horseless Age 1901). Gillette’s 1901 Blue Book \ncovered the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, \nWashington, and Baltimore metropolitan areas. Its stated \npurpose was to promote touring by establishing routes \nthat connected automobile “supply stations.” The Blue \nBook placed stations into four categories according to the \nservices they provided. \nFig. 1. Route index map, urban map, and beginning of Route \n51. (Source: Official Automobile Blue Book, Vol. 4 The Middle\nWest, 1910, p. 148-149.)\nSixty-two routes were included in the 1901 edition. Each \nroute consisted of a short descriptive paragraph along \nwith a table showing information about supply stations. \nTowns were linked together in such a way as to ensure \nthat supply stations would be found every ten to fifteen \nmiles (sixteen to twenty-four kilometers). The distance \nbetween each station, along with the surface material and \ncondition of the roads, was also indicated in the guide. \nMotorists were supposed to navigate using a detailed \ndescription with few intermediate distances. \nBetween 1903 and 1905, Gillette failed to pay business \ntaxes to the state of New Jersey and in 1906 his corporate \ncharter was revoked and he lost the company (Trenton \nTimes 1906). Its assets, including the Blue Book, were \npurchased by The Class Journal Company, a large New \nYork City publishing house specializing in automobile \nand technology themed magazines. \nUnder Class Journal, the Blue Book underwent three \nimportant changes. First, Class Journal hired Robert \nBruce, famous Good Roads advocate, as Editor and \nAnton L. Westgard, famous pathfinder of the American \nWest, as cartographer. Under Bruce’s leadership the \npublication was completely redesigned and refocused, \nfurther commercializing automobile touring and \nnavigation. The publisher’s forward to the 1906 volume \nannounced these changes as “an entirely new style of \nmap-making.” The 1906 book placed more emphasis on \ntouring, and less on operations and maintenance, \nreflecting the increase in automobile ownership and \ntouring. Gone were the detailed information about supply \nstations. In its place were full-page picture \nadvertisements for garages, hotels, automobile \nmanufacturers, and other related businesses. Route index \nmaps, included for the first time in 1906, along with strip \nmaps and large-scale maps of cities and towns were also \nadded to aid tourists. Second, the 1906 guide received \nsponsorship by the American Automobile Association \n(AAA), immediately boosting its popularity. The AAA \nProceedings of the International Cartographic Association, 1, 2017.

Blue Books \nwere offered to association members at a reduced price. \nThird, in 1907, the territory covered by the guide was \nexpanded to include the southern states and this required \nincreasing the series from one volume to three. \n2.2 The Automobile Blue Book Publishing Co. Years \nIn June, 1909, The Class Journal Company spun off the \nBlue Books, reorganizing them into a new company \ncalled the Automobile Blue Book Publishing Company. \nNorton Van Sicklen, an inventor of an early speedometer, \nwas named President and Robert Bruce continued as \nEditor. The new company quickly went after the industry \ncompetition. In August, 1909, they purchased the entire \nbusiness of F.S. Blanchard Company, of Worchester, \nMassachusetts, includ- ing its Red Book publication. The \nRed Book was a similar route guide available for the New \nEngland states. Henry McNair, routefinder for the Red \nBook joined the Blue Book staff in New England (The \nAutomobile 1909a). Under this new leadership, the Blue \nBook’s scope and influence expanded rapidly. In 1909, \n25,000 books were sold and Class Journal hoped to \ndouble that figure the next year (The Automobile 1909b). \nThe 1910s were a decade of consistent growth for the \nBlue Book. During the next ten years, no other route \nguide matched its territorial coverage, route density, or \npopularity. The series steadily grew as more routes and \nterritory were added. After expanding to three volumes in \n1907, a fourth was added in 1909 and a fifth in 1912. In \n1913, a sixth volume was added, completing coverage for \nthe entire United States. At this time, the Blue Book was \nthe only route guide that could take a motorist on a \ntranscontinental journey, from coast to coast. Year after \nyear, the size and coverage of the series grew until it \nreached its peak in 1920 with thirteen volumes (Table 1). \nTable 1. Territorial coverage, size, and price of the Official \nAutomobile Blue Book series \nProceedings of the International Cartographic Association, 1, 2017.

Apparently, a business model that \nincluded a thirteen-volume series, and the work that went \ninto maintaining it, proved too costly and unsustainable. \nIn 1920, the Company filed for bankruptcy in the United \nStates District Court of Southern New York and was \nplaced into receivership. Court documents show the \ncompany had $572,000 in assets, but $625,000 in \nliabilities and $1,170,000 of debt. While in receivership, \nthe Company reduced the size of the 1921 series by one \nvolume, to twelve total, and increased the price of the \nvolumes from $3 to $4 each (Table 1). The company \nemerged from bankruptcy in late 1921 reorganized as \nAutomobile Blue Books, Incorporated. \nAutomobile Blue Books, Inc. may have been leaner, but \nits guides indicate a company in decline. In 1922, the \nentire series was condensed into four volumes in a clear \nattempt to reduce costs. This was achieved by \nconsolidating volumes, cutting routes, and abbreviating \nthe route directions. For example, Volumes 7, 8, and 9 \nfrom 1921 were combined to create Volume 4 for 1922. \nRoutes were removed and those that remained were \nprinted in a smaller amount of space. The 1921 Volume 7 \nlists forty-eight routes (including reverse routes) in \nNebraska. In 1924, only twenty of them remain. The \n1924 Volume 4 used a smaller font, two-column pages, \nabbreviated and omitted common words such as “turn” \nand “corner,” and omitted intermediate mileages so it \ncould squeeze over 1,500 routes into 793 pages. The price \nof each volume remained $4 in 1922 and 1923, but was \nreduced back to $3 in 1924, probably in response to \ndeclining sales (Table 1). \nStill more drastic changes were to come. In 1926, the \nAAA stopped distributing Blue Books and launched its \nown series of guide books to replace them. Without its \nprivileged relationship with the AAA, sales fell. Blue \nBook publish- ers attempted in 1928 to make the series \nmore competitive by switching to a nine volume atlas \nformat. All turn-by- turn directions were removed and \nreplaced with large-scale highway maps, greatly reducing \nthe number of pages in each volume. The price of each \nwas even reduced from $3 to $1. This radical change, \nhowever, could not stem the sales decline. In 1930, \npublishers redesigned the series once again, this time as a \ntall, slim, guidebook with a large, accordion-style foldout\nmap. Five volumes were offered and priced at 75 \ncents each. A final redesign was done in 1932, this time \nas a double-folded saddle-stapled brochure. The largescale\nhighway maps were reduced and an even greater \nemphasis was placed on tourist destinations and services. \nThe brochures were distributed for free and it is unknown \nhow many volumes were in the series. These changes \nwere ultimately not enough to save the series and it \nceased publication after 1937 (Table 1). \n3. Pathfinders\nBlue Book route directions were compiled by pathfinders. \nPathfinders were early automobilists who field-compiled \nroutes while traveling local, unmarked, roads. Although \nthey did not call themselves cartographers, they were \ngeo- graphical data field collectors and considered their \nwork to be an “art and a science,” much the same as \nmodern-day cartographers. The Class Journal Company \nrelied on information provided by pathfinders and auto \nclub members. The compiler’s forward to a 1907 Blue \nBook acknowledges “the friendly cooperation received \nfrom the American Auto- mobile Association, its \naffiliated and other clubs, and from tourists who have \nplaced notes of their own trips” (Class Journal Co. 1907, \nxxxv). \nSome pathfinders were successful enough to parlay their \nskills into full-time employment. Perhaps the most \nfamous and successful professional pathfinder was Anton \nL. Westgard, who was employed as Field Representative\nand official pathfinder for the AAA. Westgard was born\nin Norway, in 1865, and immigrated to the United States\nat age eighteen. He began his pathfinding career in 1903,\nafter purchasing his first automobile, and in just a few\nyears earned the reputation as a foremost authority on\nautomobile routes and touring. According to his memoirs,\nTales of a Pathfinder, he was instrumental in establishing\nnearly forty trans-continental routes, including the\nLincoln Highway (1920). The Class Journal Company\nhired Westgard in 1906 as official cartographer and he is\ncredited in the 1907 Volume 1 as such. His maps even\ncontain his initials (ALW). Westgard continued as\ncartographer until the Automobile Blue Book Publishing\nCompany was formed in 1909 and apparently did not join\nthe new company.\nIn addition to relying on amateur pathfinders from\nautomobile clubs, by 1907 the Blue Book publishers were\nemploying their own professional pathfinders and\noutfitting them with official cars. The 1907 guide states\nthat “between eight and nine thousand miles of the routes\ndescribed anew for 1907 have been covered personally,\neither by the Blue Book car, or by our staff in cooperation\nwith local autoists” (Class Journal Co 1907, xxxiii). One\nsuch professional Blue Book pathfinder was John P.\nDods. Dods was born in 1883, in Fredonia NY. In 1908,\nhe graduated from Cornell University with a degree in\nmechanical engineering. Later that year he was hired in\nthe editorial department of The Automobile, a trade\njournal owned by Class Journal. When the Automobile\nBlue Book Publishing Company was formed in 1909 he\nwas appointed “Western Manager” and spent the next ten\nyears with the company.\nEach official Blue Book car was operated by a two-man\nteam, consisting of a driver and “route compiler,” whose\njob was to mark mileages, turns, and landmarks. A 1910\nChicago Daily Tribune article described these workers as\n“geography makers [or] professional route finders, who\nscour the country in their machines mapping out fresh\ntrails for automobile tourists who wish to take long runs\nProceedings of the International Cartographic Association, 1, 2017. This contribution underwent single-blind peer review based on \nsubmitted abstracts | https://doi.org/10.5194/ica-proc-1-7-2017 | © Authors 2017.

At \nfirst, he explains, route data was recorded as long-hand \ndirections. This process proved inadequate, especially as \nthe speed of the pathfinding cars increased and in areas \nwhere the landscape was complex. Also, it was difficult \nto write a reverse route from longhand directions. The \nBlue Book pathfinders, therefore, devised a method of \nshorthand sketching. Dods explained that the sketch \nsaved time and provided data from which a route could \nbe written in both directions. Figure 2 is an example \nsketch map from Dods’s article. According to Dods, the \nsketch and its symbols standardized the route information \nand simplified interpretation. He writes, “Even a stranger \nwho never covered a mile of the route could take one of \nthese sketches and knowing the symbols could read it \nnow or a year hence” (Dods 1911, 4). One wonders why \nthe Blue Book publishing company went through the \nadded effort of compiling written directions then, instead \nof just publishing the sketches, but that is a future topic. \nFig. 2. Example pathfinder sketch map. (Source: Dods, 1911.) \nWorking from spring to late fall, each team spent the \nentire driving season covering thousands of miles as they \ncreated new routes and updated others in their assigned \nregion of the United States. Robert Bruce and John F. \nMixer, for instance, assigned to New York state, drove \nover 10,000 miles (16,093 km) in 1909. E. R. Mixer and \nHenry MacNair, responsible for all New England, \ncovered 11,000 miles (17,702 km). John P. Dods and \nFred G. Lee, responsible for the Middle West, covered \nover 10,000 miles (16,093 km) that season (The \nAutomobile 1910). \nThe work was slow, especially by modern standards. \nBefore developing new routes, teams explored alternate \nroads so they could find those with the shortest distance \nor most scenic value. A typical crew covered an average \nof 15 miles (24 km) an hour. Crews were considered \nhighly efficient if they covered 150 miles (241 km) in a \nday, but because of interruptions and bad weather, an \naverage week only produced 300 miles (482 km) of new \nroute. After field-compiling their notes while on the road, \ncrews mailed them back to the New York City or \nChicago offices where they awaited the crew members \nreturn at the end of the driving season. Field crew \nmembers were responsible for writing their own turn-byturn\ndirections from the sketches, although draftsmen and \ncartographers compiled the guide’s maps. The cost of this \nroutefinding work was high. Publishers spent almost \n$1,000 per month on each team, including $600 for the \nsalaries of the driver and route compiler (Chicago Daily \nTribune 1910). These figures do not include the \nproduction costs associated with drafting the maps and \nassembling the turn-by-turn directions, or the costs of \npublication. \n4. Reasons for the rise and fall of the Automobile\nBlue Book\nBlue Books were uniquely suited for navigating the \nprimitive network of local roads that existed prior to the \n1920s. Today, the methods of navigating by detailed \nmileages and turn-by-turn directions appear cumbersome \nand unnecessary to some drivers, especially those who \nexcel at map reading, but they were ideally suited for the \nconditions of automobile travel during the first two \ndecades of the twentieth century. Roads at the time were \nconstructed with only local uses in mind and often lacked \ndescriptive signage. Prior to the automobile, roads that \nstretched across the country, or even a state, in an \nunbroken fashion were unnecessary. Travel that far was \nreserved for railroads. Therefore, anyone wishing to \ntravel cross-country by automobile was forced to make \nhundreds of turns onto hundreds of different roads. Such \ndetail could not be depicted at an appropriate scale on a \nsheet map because of the generalization that would be \nrequired. Publishers and automobile enthusiasts turned to \nroute guides such as the Automobile Blue Book and their \nturn-by-turn directions as a more effective solution. As \nautomobile touring increased in popularity during the \n1910s, so did the Automobile Blue Book because it was \nthe ideal navigating companion. \nBy the mid-1920s, though, the popularity of Blue Books \nbegan to wane because of competition from emerging \nsheet maps. Motorists could obtain maps for little or no \ncost, so it became increasingly difficult for them to justify \nthe high cost of a Blue Book set. In 1926, the American \nAssociation of State Highway Officials (AASHO) \ndevised a unified highway identification plan based on \none and two-digit numbers (Weingroff 1997). States \nquickly adopted this plan, which ensured that all \ninterstate routes maintained the same numeric \ndesignations from start to finish. Combined with \nimprovements to the highway system that built new roads \nProceedings of the International Cartographic Association, 1, 2017.

Thus sheet maps could effectively depict a \ngeneralized route at an appropriate scale. The Official \nAutomobile Blue Book series fell out of favor during the \nlate 1920s because improvements to the road network and \na uniform highway identification system made their \nsolution to the navigational problem obsolete and allowed \nsheet maps to take their place. \n5. The commercial legacy of the Automobile\nBlue Book\nThe Official Automobile Blue Books introduced \ncommercialization to automobile touring and the business \nof road mapping. Automobile Blue Books encouraged \nand promoted automobile touring and users were \nexpected to patronize the businesses that advertised in the \nseries. Each volume contained hundreds of \nadvertisements for automobile-related literature, hotels, \nresorts, garages, auto dealers, and other related \nbusinesses. Some even displayed signs advertising \nthemselves as “Official Automobile Blue Book Garage” \nor “Official Automobile Blue Book Hotel.” It is unknown \nwhether these businesses paid a premium advertising fee \nfor the endorsement, or if the distinction was granted on \ntheir own merit. Regardless, it is clear that tourists were \nexpected to patronize the businesses that advertised in the \nguides. Popular touring destinations also advertised, often \npurchasing large, multiple-page, color advertisements that \nwere intended to increase touring interest. For example, \nin the middle of the 1921 Volume 7, which covers the \nsouthern Plains and Rocky Mountain states, is a fullcolor,\ntwenty-four page “National Touring Objectives” \ninsert. This special section advertises destinations \nthroughout the United States, including New England, \nNew York, North Carolina, Michigan, Colorado, \nMontana, and Oregon. Since route directions to some of \nthese destinations are covered in other Blue Book \nvolumes, these advertisements also prompted users to \npurchase additional volumes in the series. \nThis pattern of commercialization was followed years \nlater by the ubiquitous “oil company” road maps \n(Akerman 2006, 2002, 1993; Ristow 1964, 1946; \nSchmiedeler and Perucca, 1996) and the official state \nhighway maps that be- came commonplace after them \n(Akerman and Block, 2005). “Oil company” maps were \nintended to foster brand loyalty to the issuing oil \ncompany, thus selling more petroleum products. \nCompanies gave away free maps in hopes that tourists \nwould return again and again to their branded service \nstations. Official state highways maps were also intended \nto be tools of economic development. They advertised \ntouring destinations, thus encouraging tourists to spend \ntheir time, and money, within the issuing state. \nToday, the commercial legacy of Automobile Blue Books \nis continued by the Tour Book series from the AAA and \nthe many websites, maps, and glossy tourist guides \nproduced by state departments of tourism. Even the \ncumbersome turn-by-turn navigation method used in the \nBlue Books has returned with a modern counterpart. \nWebsites such as Google Maps, and in-car GPS \nnavigation units provide maps and turn-by-turn directions \nwith the click of a mouse or push of a button. It is a bit \nironic that turn-by-turn directions, the navigation method \nabandoned by the Automobile Blue Book in 1928, are \nwidely available today and seem to be gaining in \npopularity. In many ways, even though Blue Books have \nbeen gone for 80 years, they are still with us today. \n6. Acknowledgements\nI would like to thank the late David L.
