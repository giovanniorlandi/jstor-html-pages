The, purpose of the book set forth by the, 1 author in the pieface and dedication, is to immortalize the deeds of heroism, of the women of the South who, while they did not go to the front in, the awful days of the Civil War did, so much for the cause so dear to their, hearts and suffered not only from the, anxiety tint must ever he the eueiOon, of the family of a *.?! iier but, aiso from physical and material, needs without a murmur., The Debatable Land " was Fauquier, county where, during the entire, war the Northern and Southern forces, fouyht for mastery, and ownership,", "Mosby\'s Confederacy" as it, was often called.

The constant, recurrence of name- that are household, words with us adds to the interest, of the book and the illustrations,, many of them reproductions of old, phutcraphs, are especially\' interesting., . Certainly* all Southern soldiers, should be interested in the movement, to build a monument to the, women of the Confederacy and the, readir.fr of this book will add material, interest t<> the movement in the hearts, of those who were not so closely as- j, soeiatcd w -h these women as Mr., Hunter and his comrades, hut who, \' believed ;p keeping before the eyes, of the young the enduring monuments, of heroic deeds in women as well as, those of men., V, " -, :; k - .- < .., ale:, | MAKE COMPANIONS . {, OF YOUR CHILDREN.
