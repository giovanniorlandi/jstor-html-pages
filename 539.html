Lemann & Iro.\nAID DOESNI\'T OlE--IT HAS TO\nBE KILLED.\nHair often continues to live and\ngrow long after the death of the\nbody. But it is often- killed through\nneglect or misuse. Almost always\ntihE woman or man whose hair is\nfalling out, or is stringy, lifeless and\ndull-looking, is entirely to blame be\ncause of not giving it the proper care,\nIt is easy to take care of the hair-\neasy to make it more beautiful. Use\nHarmony Hair Beautifier, to make\nit glossy, soft and silky, and Har\nmony Shampoo to keep hair and\nscalp thoroughly clean.\nHarmony Hair Beautifier, delight\nfully perfumed with true rose, is very\neasy to apply-simply sprinkle a lit\ntle on your hair each time before\nbrushing it. It contains no oil, and\nwill not change the color of the hair\nnor darken gray hair.\nTo keep your hair and scalp dan\ndruff-free and clean, use Harmony\nShampoo. This pure liquid shampoo\nis most convenient to use, giving an\ninstantaneous rich, foaming lather\nthat immediately penetrates to every\npart of the hair and scalp, insuring\na quick and thorough cleansing. It\nis washed off just as quickly, the en\ntire operation taking only a few\nmoments. Contains nothing that can\n_har- t hair,- le aves- no harsh\nness or stickiness-just a sweet\ncleanliness.\nBoth preparations come in odd\nshaped, very ornamental bottles, with\nsprinkler tops.

The\nmain structure is to be of reinforced\nconcrete, with polychrome tile roof,\nterra-cotta trimmings,, marble floors\nand wainscoting, plaster walls and\nceiling, and is to be steam-heated\nand lighted with electricity.\nHow to .Control Cotton Boll Worm.\nThe Department of Agriculture has\nrecently received numerous inquiries\nabout injury by the cotton boll worm,\nespecially in the eastern part of the\nbelt. In many cases this insect has\nbeen confused with the boll weevil,\nand several erroneous reports about\nthe occurrence of that pest in new\nregions have thus become prevalent.\nThe boll worm is the larva of a\nmoth, and is only very distantly re\nlated to the weevil, which belongs\nto the large natural group of beetles,\nThe worm when first hatched is very\ntiny, but grows rapidly, becoming\nfinally a little over an inch long, and\ngreenish or brownish in color. The\nweevil grub is white and found only\nwithin the cotton square or boll. It\nnever exceeds one-half inch in length.\nIn the case of the current out\nbreak the injury began so late in the\nseason that little can be done to pro\ntect the present crop. Nevertheless,\na farmer can insure the crop of\nthe coming season against in\njury by the pest with comparatively\nlittle trouble and expense. The ac\ntion that should be taken wherever\ninjury has occurred this year is to\npick the cotton as quickly as possi\nble and immediately thereafter to\nplow and harrow the fields. This\nwork will result in the destruction of\nthe immature stages of the worm,\nwhich have passed just beneath the\nsurface of the soil. In addition to\nthe effect in destroying the-insect\nthe plowing and harrowing of the\nfields will have very great value in\nthe way of preparing for the crop of\nthe following season.\nMethods of control of the boll\nworm which are applicable in differ\nent seasons of the year are described\nin Farmers\' Bulletin 290.\nLocks Will Come.\nThe question of building locks in\nBayou Lafourche at Donaldsonville\nwill have to be decided by the two\nlevee boards, as the people of the\nparishes interested are worked up to\nthe point of wanting the locks built\nor the dam removed. Opinion differs\nin this parish, but there is no doubt\nthe damming of the bayou was one\nof the hardest blows this town\never received.--Thibodaux Commer\ncial-Journal.\nThe freshet in southwest Louisi\nana and southeast Texas has subsided\nafter creating big damage to crops.\nRice suffered severely and estimates\nof the loss go as high as 20 per cent\nof the total yield.\nCITY\'S FINANCES REtIEWEDi.\nCondition of Municipal Treasury Set Forth in De\ntail--Statement of Floating and Bonded Indebt\nedness--First Report of Light and\nWater Commission--Budget\nfor Current Six Months.\nAt a regular meeting of the com\nmission council on the 6th instant,\nthe following report of the city audi\ntor was read:\nDonaldsonville, La., Sept. 1, 1913.\nTo the Honorable Mayor and Com\nmission Council, Donaldsonville,\nLa.\nGentlemen:-I beg leave to sub\nmit the following reports for the quar\nter ending August 31, to-wit:\nSchedule "A," statement of re\nceipts and disbursements, general\nfund.\nSchedule "B," statement of re\nceipts and disbursements, bond re\ndemption fund.\nSchedule "C," statement of ex\npenditures for the quarter ending\nAugust 31.\nSchedule "D," statement of float\ning and bonded indebtedness at this\ndate.\nSchedule "A."\nGeneral Fund.\nReceipts\n1913 licenses.------...-- --..----$ 148 50\nBridge notes June and Aug.\npaid....------------------- 80\n19"8 rental of batture prop\nerty ...................-------------------. 72 00\nMay liget bills and meter\nrentals.................. 692 94\nWater bills and meter rent\nals ...................-- . 296 41\n1911 taxes, costs and int.... 8 68\n1912 taxes, costs and int.... 611 49\nFines, mayor\'scol-rt ....... 151 50\nOther sources --........------...... 14 58\nTotal cash receipts----------------............$ 2079 49\nDisbursements\nOverdraft June 1, Bank of\nDonaldsonville .-.......$ 513 06\nPayrolls for salaries and\nwages, including grass\ncutting, ditching, etc... 1661 67\nAudited vouchers-----------........... 547 27\nTotal disbursements....................------------$ 2722 00\nOverdraft Aug. 31, due Bank of D\'ville.$ 642 51\nSchedule "B."\nBond Redemption Fund\nReceipts\nBalance June 1 ----..------. ....$ 8118 28\n1911 taxes and interest...... 2 58\n1912 taxes and interest ..... 293 27\nInterest on sinking fund\nfrom Jan. 1 to June 31,\n1913-----.................. 5538\nTotal-------------------........-................. -$ 8489 51\nDisbursements\nInterest coupons due June\n31, 1913.............................. -------------------------1400 00\nBalance cash on band A ...... -.. - 7088951,\'\nSchedule "\'C."\nStatement of Quarterly Rxpenditures.\nDepartment of Public Affairs, Health and\nSafety\nMayor\'s office, incidentals\n(deficit May. 1913) ......$ 17 19\nOfficial printing -----------... 35 44\nRegistration lists (April\nelection) ...............-------------- 8 32\nFire department. new hose,\n$125, feed bills. $11.90.... 636 90\nMaintenance tire alarm\nsystem ..................----------- 990\nPolice department, salaries.\n$420.04, telephone, etc.,\n$3.50----------........-------- 423 54\nHealth department. killing\nbuzzards. $68.75, sup\nplies, etc.. $76.35-........ 145 10\nPublic charity ................ 8 85 - $ 1285 24\nDepartment of Finance\nAuditor\'s salary .....-......-------. 75 00\nCollector\'s commissions.... 55 78\nStationery, printing. etc.... 26 13- 156 91\nDepartment of Streets and Parks\nb Repairs to bridges and\nwharf ................... 83 72\nStreet cleaning, grassing,\nditching, etc ---..-------......... 1385 74\nMaintenance of tools and\ns equipment............--------------. 78 69\nRepairs to market building 7 45\nMaintenance of park and\ntrees .........-------......... ------------47 35- 1602 95\nB rotal expenditures------.....--..--..-----............ $ 3045 10\n5 8 ___\nSchedule "D."\nFloating and Bonded Indebtedness\nMaturing Jan. 15, 1013\n1 cert, indebtedness.

B.--While the above statement\nshows an apparent loss of $330.60, at\ntention must be directed to the fact\nthat owing to the failure of the\npumping plant contractors to get\ntheir equipment in satisfactory\noperating condition for test and ap\nproval of the Louisiana Fire Preven\ntion Bureau, we were compelled to\ncontinue to operate the old steam\npumping equipment at an additional\nexpense of fuel and labor amounting\nto: Coal, $784.98; labor, $263; a to\ntal of $1047.98, which expense will be\nentirely eliminated when the effici\nency of the electric turbine pumps is\nproven to the entire satisfaction of\nthe Louisiana Fire Prevention Bureau.\nTests of the plant have been made,\nthough under adverse conditions, and\nwe are in hope of securing an early\nrelease from operating the steam\nplant. The pump contractors having\ndefaulted in the punctual and satis\nfactory fulfillment of their contract,\nmust be held accountable for this ad\nditional cost of operation, and steps\nhave already been taken to withhold\nfinal payment on account of contract\nuntil the matter is arranged and\nsettled to the satisfaction of this\nCommission.\nIt is well, likewise, to state that\nowing to an improper adjustment of\nthe)ienaeeLengines by the erecting\nengineer, the consumption of fuel oil\nduring the first two months of oper\nation was rather in excess of the\nrated guarantee, and for this addition\nal cost of operation we propose to\nhold the engine people accountable.\nThe engines have finally been proper\nly adjusted and synchronized, and are\nnow operating satisfactorily, with a\nconsequent reduction in the fuel oil\nconsumption.\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities.\nAssets:\nGost of plant and equip\nment...... ...... . $... 51,437 98\nInvestment in light meters 154 70\nOld machinery stock (cost\nof laying by)......... 10 40\nAccounts receivable (light\nand power customers).. 1426 39\nAccounts receivable (water\ncustomers).. ........... 147 17\nSundry debtors ........ 325 10\nUnexpired insurance .... 247 96\ni Operating deficit ........ 330 60\n$ 54,080 30\n(Continued on page four.)\nLIST OF PRIZE WINNERS AT FAIR I\nAGRICULTURAL DEPARTM.INT.\nBest and greatest. variety of farm\nproducts grown on a single farm\ntstate prize)-First prize, Oak Grove\nAgricultural High School, Hope Viil,*\nIBest 10 ears seed corn (state\nprize)--\'irst prize, -Creel tUhandler,\nD)arrow, $5; . second prize, S.

A heavy rain fell Wednes\nday night., accompanied by a vivid t\nelectrical display, the precipitation 1;\ntotalling 3.80 inches.\nFull advantage was taken of the e\nseveral days of good weather which\nhave prevailed during the past fort\nnight to press cane planting opera\ntions, and quite a large acreage has\nbeen seeded. The area thus worked,\nhowever, is considerably smaller than\nin former years, and the bulk of the\ncrop remains to be planted in the\nspring.\nHundreds of negroes have passed\n(through this city within the last C\nfew cays, en route to various plan\ntations throughout the sugar belt,\n,wihere they will be employed in the\nfields and factories during the grind- t\ning season. The movement of these\ndusky laborers is fully as large as in\nprevious years.\nThe McCall Company\'s Evan Hall\nmill was the first factory in this sec\ntion to begin grinding, havung com\nmenced work Tuesday. A slight de\nlay was caused shortly after begin\nning operations through the breaking\nof a sprocket wheel on the interme- I\ndiate carrier, but the damage was\nquickly repaired and the well- i\nequipped plant was soon pegging\naway as smoothly as ever.

Acting\n* P~-esident Frederick Wilbert, of Pla\nquemine, called the assemblage to\norder and served as chairman. The\nmeeting was addressed at some\nlength by Hon. Donelson Caffery and\nW. T. King, and their remarks were\nfollowed by a general discussion of\nthe progress of the movement to\ndate.\nIt developed that the success of the\nlundertaking could be regarded as\ncertain, and that the fundamental\nprinciple of co-operation would be\napplied to correcting and overcoming\nmany deficiencies in the business of\nproducing and marketing sugar, it\nhaving already accomplished the de\nsired result in many other lines of\n,human activity.\nMessages were received from E. G.\nRobiohaux, S. Prejean and others\nwho were unable to attend personal\nly, endorsing the movement and\npledging their hearty support.\nThere were present Messrs. James\nP. Kock, T. D.

Hall has not failed to exercise\nthis prerogative in other instances,\nand there is no apparent reason why\nhe should object to doing likewise in\nthe present case.\nWjhen he is informed of all the cir\ncumstances, and particularly of the\nplightCd faith of the state and the\nlevee boards to the United States\ngovernment that the dam should be\nonly a temporary obstruction and\nthat locks would be built to replace\nit-a specific and voluntary obliga\ntion assumed as a prerequisite to\ntile granting of the privilege to ob\nstruct a navigable stream-we feel\nconfident the governor will quickly\nrecognize the propriety of calling upon\nthe levee boards to carry out the\nmandate of the law and the terms of\ntheir contractual agreement. -\n\'What is everybody\'s business is\ntoo often nobody\'s, and it will do no\ngood if our people satisfy themselves\nwith merely talking about and protest\nirg against the attitude and policy of\nthe levee boards witn regard to this\nimportant matter.

The\nlocal Chamber of Commerce has\nmade this object one of the planks\nof its platform, so to speak, and the\nformation of such a committee as we\nhave suggested can therefore be most\nappropriately taken up by the cham\nher, We urge that this be done at\nonce.\nTHE TIMId, THE PLACE ANI THE\nMAN.\nA meeting of the stockholders of\nthe South Louisiana Fair Associa\ntion is to be held tomorrow; for the\npurpose of electing officers and di\nrectors for~ -5 comingl year, azi\nThe Chief takes the liberty of sug\ngesting that Prof.\' R. S. Vickers\nshould by all means be chosen to\nmanage next year\'s fair.\nThe success of the association\'s\nfirst effort points with certainty to\na bigger, better and far more success\ntut tar in 1914,. and nothing will more\nsurely create public confidence in\nthe realization of this forecast than\nthe announcement that Prof. Vickers\nis to be the directing head of the\nenterprise.\nIt will offend no one else con\nnected with this month\'s fair, we are\nquite convinced, to say that to Prof.\nVickers is due "the lion\'s share" of\ncredit for the gratifying outcome. of\nthat enterprise. He was "on the\njob" continually, working hard enough\nto endanger his health, and evincing\na never-failing spirit of optimism\nthat proved infectious and con\ntagious, affecting all with whom he\ncame in contact. A better spirit of\nco-operation was manifested in con\nnection with this fair than has been\nexhibited in Donaldsonville for many\na day. Everybody gave the best that\nwas in them, but Prof. Vickers was\ntOhe organizer and leader, and the\nharmony and unity of effort that\nmarked the movement were brought\nabout largely by his tact and diplo\nmacy.\nHe has "played no favorites,"\' sid\ned with no particular faction, culti\nvatled no leaders or otherwise dis\nplayed partiality. He has simply\n"boosted" earnestly and constantly,\nand has succeeded in inducing many\nof our hitherto lethargic citizens to\ndo likewise.\nHis invaluable services should be\nretained by the fair association, no\nmatter what concessions or consider\nations may be necessary to that end.\nVOTE NEXT TUESI1AY!\nTuesday next, the 2Hth instant, is\nthe day set for the election of dele\ngates to the constitutional conven\ntion, and although there is no opposi\ntion to the candidacy of R.

N. Pugh is the Democratic\nnominee and an unopposed candidate.\nMr., Pugh has served long and ef\nficiently in this capacity, and he\neminently deserves the compliment\nof a full vote in favor of his resump\ntion of the duties he so well perform\ned in the past.\nMr. Sims will be a capable and\ncreditablh representative of Ascen\nsion in the constitutional conven\ntion, and Mr. Pugh will be a capable\nand creditable representative of Don\naldsonville in the councils of the pa\nrochial board of school directors.\nOur citizens will therefore do a\nproper and creditable thing to go to\nthe polls next Tuesday and vote for\nR.

Over\ntwo hundred and fifty delegates\nfrom Texas and Louisiana were pres\nent to participate in the deliberations\nof the convention, not counting the\ndelegates from Orange, of whom\nthere was a large number in attend\nance at all the sessions. The con\nvention opened Friday morning with\nan address of welcome on behalf of\nthe city of Orange, which was re\nsponded to by Hon. John Marks of\nAssumption.\n\'Notable addresses were made by\ndelegates from various sections of the\ncountry which will be linked togeth\ner by a great waterway when the in\nland coastal canal will be completed.\nEspecially, noteworthy was the ad\ndress of Congressman Henry of\nWaco, Texas, who looked upon the\nwork which the league has in charge\nas second in importance to the\nPanama Canal. Starting from the\nRio Grande on the west, a line of\nwaterway will furnish through trans\nportation to the Mississippi on the\neast, thus putting in close touch the\ntfvo great states, Texas and Louisi\nana, besides opening up a large ter\nritory which has been undeveloped\non account of the want of transpor\ntation facilities.\nThe entire Lafourche country, and\nDonaldsonvflle in particular, is vital\nly interested in the great work which\nthis 1eague is vigorously prosecuting\nto completion. The convention unan\nimously adopted among other reso\nlutions one recommending the water\nroute from Morgan City to the La\nfourche, via Cancienne canal, as a\npart of the intercoastal canal. The\nimmediate availability of this route,\ncoupled with the fact that it is the\nshortest route to the Mississippi\nrivers and maintainable at but little\ncost, was pointed out by the several\ndelegates representing this section.\nMuch tonnage is expected to pass\nthrough the inland waterway when\ncompleted, and there can be no ques\ntion but that with the route open\nthrough Bayou Lafourche to the Mis\nsissippi river, the great bulk of the\ntrade will pass this way. A number\nof prominent delegates from Texas ex\npressed themselves strongly in favor\nof the route via Bayou Lafourche and\nDonaldsonville.\n0n Friday night the good people\nof Orange entertained the delegates\nwith a smoker and dance at the\nElks\' Home, and on Saturday after\nnoon the delegates were taken for\na ride down the Sabine river and\non one of the canals which is now:\nbeing dug. There a large dredge was\nin operation excavating a canal about\nsixty feet in width, with a depth of\nsix feet.\nFor the convention next year both\nNew Orleans and Houston were ap\nplicants, and."decision thereon was\nleft to the exttive committee. All\nthe present \'able officers of the\nleague were re-elected, and Clarence\nBarton of Assumption was elected\na member of the executive commit\ntee from Louisiana.\nThe Assumption-Ascension delega\ntion,. through whose efforts the La\nfourche-Cancienne route was recog\nnized, comprised Messrs. Clarence\nBarton, Eddie Gianelloni, John Marks,\nH. C. Whiteman\' and Walter Lemann.\nPriests Transferred. ,\nRev. V. J.

There\nwill be no assistant priest for the\nDonaldsonville church thereafter, the\nterritorial area of the parish having\nbeen reduced to such an extent as to\nelJbld a single priest to attend to\nthe work.\nFathers Monteillard and Gardes\nmade many warm friends among\ntheir parishioners and the public gen\nerally during their stay in this com\nmunity, and their removal is sincere\nly regretted.

The Louisiana sugar\nindustry is not going to die out, but\nwill be radically changed as the new\nconditions now environing it take\neffect, and it will be prevented from\nattaining the large proportion of the\nsugars consumed in the federal Union\nthat our alluvial lands have promised\nto bring to us at an early day by\nthe adoption of all modern methods\nin sugar agriculture and manufacture,\nin which Louisiana has been the lead\ner of the cane sugar world during\nseveral decades. Of course every pos\nsible economy must be effected, but\nthose economies must be the result\nnot so much of diminished expendi\nture for the many mechanisms of the\nindustry, but by securing a Higher\ndegree of effectiveness in the work\ndone in the fields and in the fac\ntory, and securing whatever intrinsic\nvalue the sugar markets of the world\nentitle us to, based upon the quality\nof the material we turn out as the\nfinal product.\n"Our corresponndent singles out\nseveral features of the Louisiana su\ngar industry as being susceptible to\nimprovement. Conspicuous among\nthese is the necessity for turning\nout the highest possible grades of su\n,ar. With the diminishing margin\nof .profit this situation seems self\nevident and yet worthy of reiteration.\nThe next suggestion is to seek the\nbest markets and not practically to\nauction off the sugars to unwilling\nbuyers at whatever price these buy\ners may be willing to give.\n"The suggestion as to a change in\npackages is a novel idea, and yet no\nmore novel than was the change\nfrom the old-fashioned sugar hogs\nhead to the miodern sugar barrel.\nMillions of bags of Rio coffee are\nroasted in New York and in New Or\nleans and shipped into the country in\ncases containing pound packages all\nready for instant delivery to the dis\ntant consumer. Our correspondent\nu.-res simiiar pul-king and similar\ndisposal of our high-grade sugars, all\nof whic\'h would seem a natural out\ncome of the present situation and\nvery worthy of practice.\n"The suggestions as to a selling or\nganization to become effective would\nseem to demand large financial re\nsources to care for those distressed\nsellers whose necessities may be so\npressing as to demand peremptory\nsales. The. suggestion is worthy of\ncareful study, and we note that prac\ntically every large industry is now en\ndeavoring to secure such selling con\ntrol for itself.\n"The suggestion as to advertise\nment and familiarizing the people with\nthe intrinsic value of Louisiana su\ngars, of their delightful flavor, where\nany flavor is left in the sugars, or\nthe thoroughness and cleanliness of\nall of our manufacturing operations,\nand how those desiring such sugars\ncan secure fine crystals of Louisiana\nsugars made direct from the sugar\ncane by one continuous process, is ad\nmirable. Such advertising could not\nwell do other than attract great at\ntention to this product, which a few\nlecadea ago was the favorite sugar\nf the United States, and has only\nlapsed from thattavor because it was\npossible for our sugar producers to go\n,n in the industry without taking the\n3ains of making the strenuous efforts\nthat have now become necessary to\ntave the industry from extinction.\niVe shall hope that these suggestions,\nr some of them, will lead to early\n:onsideration andi the formation of\n:ompetent organization for their de\nrelopment."\nUSE Of CALOMEL PRACTI\nCALLY STOPPEO,\nFor Bilious Attacks, Constipation and\nAll Liver Troubles--Dangerous\nCalomel Gives Way to Dodson\'s\nLiver Tone.\nEvery druggist in the state has\nnoticed a gfeat falling off in the sale\nof calomel. They all give the same\nreason. Dodson\'s Liver Tone is\ntaking its place.\n"Calomel is often dangerous \' and\npeople know it, while Dodson\'s Liver\n:Tone is perfectly safe and it gives\nbetter results," says the X-Ray Phar\nmacy.\nDodson\'s Liver Tone is personal\nly guaranteed by the X-Ray Phar\nmacy, which sells it. A large bottle\ncosts 50 cents, and if it fails to give\neasy relief in every case of sluggish\nness, you have only to ask for your\nmoney back. It will be promptly re\nturned.\nDodson\'s Liver Tone is a pleasant\ntasting, purely vegetable remedy\nharmless to both children and adults.\nA bottl. in the houses may save you\na day\'s work or keep your children\nfrom missing school.
