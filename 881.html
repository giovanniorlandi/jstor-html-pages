Clement, who is practically a\nMarion county boy, tho he studied in a\nVirginia military school and is one\nof the comparatively few army officers\nwho were appointed from West Point.\nThe visitors arrived at the Ocala\nHouse about 11 o\'clock, coming over\nfrom Gainesville in cars. They were\nmet by an informal committee con\nsisting of Postmaster Rogers, Mayor\nP.obertson, Editor Harris, Messrs. R.\nA. Burford, R. S. Hall, Walter Hood,\nThomas Sexton, W. A.

They\ncarried away pleasant memories.\nwhich the Star hopes will draw them\nthis way again.\nThe visit was a social one, and there\nwas no talk on politics and but little\nof public affairs. Congressman Clark\nhowever, answered questions about\nthe Ocala and Silver Springs canal,\nand also gave Postmasters Roirers I\nsome information that will be \' wel\ncome not only to the people east of\nthe Oklawaha river, but to Ocala\nfolks.

He says there is a movement\non foot to make a sub-road district in\nwestern Alachua and bond for half a\nmillion dollars and if it succeeds Mar\nion people will .find it much easier to\nvisit Gainesville than-, now. .\nFORD FOR SALE\nA first-class Ford touring car in ex\ncellent condition; seat covers, perfect\nworking Gray & Davis electric starter\nand lights; new tires, V-shaped rad\niator, etc. Apply; to R. : R.

C\ni As everybody knows, Mr. Clark is\n114 UCUiVViaUV liVUituw a.W& vv uvvwiiu\ndistrict. Marion county was added to\nthe district in 1913, since which time\nhe has shown a most decided disposi\ntion to do all in his power . as con\ngressman for the county. Mr.v Clark\nhas been in Congress for a dozen\nyears and is recognized as one of the\nbest and strongest men in the House.\nHe. is chairman of one of the most\nimportant committees and has mem\nbership and influence most useful to\nJ his state on others. , He was renomi\nnated by a large majority in 1914.\nThis year he had no opposition, and\naccording to the primary law became\nautomatically the nominee.\nTwo or three weeks ago, in Jackson\nville, the prohibition party of the\nstate, in a convention attended by\npossibly a dozen members, nominated\nFrancis P. Coffin for congressman\nfrom the second district. This of\ncourse was all right and regular, but\nwhat isn\'t is the tactics being employ\ned against Mr. Clark not only by his\nopponents but by men pledged to. sup\nport him. Coffin doesn\'t go on the\nplatform , and meet Clark in debate,\nlike a man, but slips around and dis\ntributes scurrilous literature against\nhim.\nAmong the literature is a circular\ncharging Mr. Clark with obtaining\nleave of absence from Congress, to\ncome to Florida, to defend the man\nRussell who was co nvicted in the\ncriminal court in Jacksonville last\nMarch on the charge of debauching\ngirls. None know any better than the\npeople of Ocala that Mr. Clark came\nto Florida on their invitation to at\ntend a social occasion in which all the\npeople of the town and county were\ninterested, that he was the honor\nguest on that occasion, and that he\nprobably would not have come to\nFlorida at that time if it hadn\'t been\nfor their request.\nThere is no name signed to this cir\ncular.\nThere is only one truth in this cir\nat\ncular, and that is that Mr. Clark\nstopped for a day in Jacksonville and\nappeared in court to, aid in the de\nf ense of Russell. He has, positive\nproof that all the rest of it is a malic\nious lie. It is evident that whoever\ncompiled the circular is a sneak and a\ncoward, for it is unsigned.\n: There is strong evidence that Sid\nney J. Catts, who claims to be the\ndemocratic nominee for governor, is\naiding Coffin in this war on" Clark,\nAlong with this circular is being dis\ntnbuted other literature. There are\ntwo slips, going together. One extols\nthe virtues of Catts, and the other ex\ntols the virtues of Coffin. There is also\na dummy state ticket for the guidance\nofj voters. Said - ticket names Tram\nmell for senator, Coffin for represen\ntive, Catts for governor and then the\ndemocratic state ticket with the name\nof Justice Taylor left off. The same\nticket appears on the back of the cir\ncular.\nIhe circular bears the imprint of\nthe Raif ord Tribune The two slips\nand the dummy ticket were all evi\ndently printed in the same shop, as\nthe type and paper are identical.\nIhe Star has 3 information that\nCats wiH (if he has not already done\nsc) pass the word to the faithful to\nsupport Coffin and knife Clark.\nCoffin was in Gainesville Saturday,\nand Mrv Clark wrote to him and, had\nplaced in his hands the following let\nter: .\n.

Coffin, Johnstown, Fla.\nDear Sir: A friend in Starke sends\nme a copy of a circular, which it is\nauu jfuu-uave ueeu circulating in\nBradford county, and presumably it is\nyour intention to circulate it in other\ncounties in the district. This circular\nis entitled "What Would You Do"?\nunder that heading, the circular\nproceeds to make a statement abou\nthe trial of one George W. Russell, at\nJacksonville, Florida, in March of thi3\nyear, and refers to my alleged con\nnection with that case. You make\nvarious other statements about me in\nthe circular referred to, and you con\nclude these charges with this state\nment: "I have official records to prove\nevery statement\' made, and these will\nbe shown to persons desiring to see\nthem."\n, I want to say to you that this circu\nlar is a tissue of falsehoods, in so far\nas it refers to me, from start to finish,\nand I desire to put you on notice now,\nthat it is my purpose to be in Starke,\nFlorida, on Monday, the 23rd. day of\nthis month, which is the first day of\nthe fall term of the circuit court of\nBradford county. And at such time\nduring the day as the court will per\nmit, to address the people of Brad\nford county, and I here and now de-\nmand that you be present and either\nprove the allegations you have made,\nor stand convicted before the people\no f thi3 district as being a deliberate\nfalsifier of facts and assassinator of\ncharacter. Frank Clark.\nCONCERNING THE CANAL\nCongresman Clark, on the occasion\nof his recent visit to this city, said,\nregarding the much discussed Silver\nSprings to Ocala canal, that if the\npeople of the city will get . together\nand give him a solid backing that it is\nmore than likely that he can get a-bill\nthru Congress to have the canal cut.\nHe says that if it is cut it will be ai\nvery strong inducement to Congress\nto have made the other improvements\non the Oklawaha, namely straighten\ning the most abrupt bends and cutting\nchannels in the narrow places.\nThe Star thinks our people had bet\nter get-together and back up our\ncongressman in this matter. The Star\nhas scoffed at the idea of a ship canal\nacross Florida at this place because it\nknows there isn\'t water enough to\nfloat a ship. It has opposed the city\ntrying to cut a canal because it knew\nit needed the money more for other\nthings. And it doesn\'t want a canal\ncut into Silver Springs, because that\nwould ruin the springs, which - are\nworth more to Ocala and Florida, and\nAmerica than any canal could be.\nBut if the government will cut a\ncanal from some point on ; the river\nbelow the springs into Ocala, that is\ndifferent matter. It will help the\ncity some, it may help it greatly, and\nit will not hurt anything. So we would\nadvise President Rogers to call the\nBoard of Trade together and see what\ncan be done. - .\nFrank Clark may not have, an easy\nwalk-over, but he will walk over.\nClearwater Sun.\nMr. Clark -will have against him\nhe votes of republicans, socialists,\nprohibitionists, . independents and\ndemocrats who do I not regard - their\nsolemn nromises as binding.

At the same time\nothers of -the enemy\'s columns con\ntinued through New Jersey and Into\nMaryland; while the regent\'s ships\nravaged the coast from Maine to\nFlorida and even about the Gulf.

Accordingly the chief of\nstan! altered his order to the general\nIn command In New York state.\n, Two fractional subdivisions of the\norder reached about the same time the\ntent in the mcampment of the Sixtieth\nIllinois, where Mart Ware, trooper in\nthe\'"-First Illinois cavalry, was giving\nto Lieutenant James Ashby the last\nletter he had received from home.

Owing to his inexperience,\nhowever. Mart disobeyed orders and\ntold the general what he really believ\ned himself that 10,000 menand 300\nguns were moving west \'\nThis\' misinformation led the general\nto believe that the true attack would\nbe aimed at his line well to the West\nof Monroe\'s farm.\n"Order at once the Third Indiana\nbrigade and the Fourth and Fifth Illi\nnois to move."

This is thoroughly saturated with a blend of soft asphalts\nthe formula of the General\'s , Board of Expert Chemists. It is then\ncoated with a blend of harder asphalts, which forms an impervious\ncoating and prevents the inner saturation from drying out.\nThis explains why CERTAIN-TEED outlives ordinary roofing, and\nwhy it is possible to guarantee it for 5, 10 or 15 years, according to\nply (1, 2 or 3). The responsibility of the world\'s largest manufacturer\nof roofings and building papers is behind this guarantee; which is\nconservative, as experience proves that CERTAIN-TEED outlives\nthe period of guarantee.\nThe General makes one third of America\'s supply of asphalt roll\nroofing. His facilities are unequaled, and he is able to produce th-3\nhighest quality roofing at the lowest manufacturing cost.\nCERTAIN-TEED is made in rolls; also in a slate-surfaced shingles.\nThere is a type of CERTAIN-TEED for every kind of building,\nwith flat or pitched roofs, from the largest sky-scraper to the smallest\nresidence or out building.\nCERTAIN-TEED is sold by responsible dealers all over the world,\nat reasonable prices.

CI . m rr r ti\nFigures Compiled from the Wall Street Journal\nPresident Flanders of the Maxwell Co. thoroughly understands the policy\nof popular leadership in the automobile field through continuous price reduc\ntions. He.says"Every.man\'l;.eyerm an automobile or in\ntended to own one. Every price reduction we make enlarges the field. Our\npopular car was $695 about a year ago when we cut it $40. This year we cut\nit $60, making the price $595, and every cut we are able to make will increase\nthe output."\nThe broadening character of the automobile industry is shown by the fact\nthat while Ford and Maxwell are reducing prices, several higher-priced cars\nare advancing their prices and cars of limited output and of super-excellence\nin individualized construction and finish are contemplating radical advances.\nThe highest-priced car in the future will be more than ten times and pos\nsibly more than twelve times the price of either the Ford or Maxwell.\nWe class these two cars together because they are substantially at the\nsame price when the accessories, such as electric starter, demountable rims,\nspeedometer, etc., are added to the price of a Ford or deducted from the price\nof a Maxwell; yet the Maxwell is a larger type of car, more artistic iin appear\nance and claimVother points of superiority.\n\' .
