Strong died at\nBoulder, Colorada, on Dec. 6, aged\n17 years and 5 days, the daughtei\nof George H. and Delia Strong.\nTen years ago the then little girl\'s\nmother died in McCook, Nebraska.\nThe child was cared for there by rel\natives for a year, after which she in\ncompany with her grandmother\ncame east to reside with her uncle,\nSmith Strong, at Muncy Valley, and\nwhere she lived four years. She\nthen went to Judge Taylor\'s, at\nStrawbridge, where she remained\nuntil last June, when symtoms rap\n. idly developed which indicated quick\nt consumption. Miss Strong,s father\nhad her come to Nebraska hoping\nthat the climate might prove bene\n■ ficial to her health. After remain\n) ing there for a few months and de\nriving no benefit from the change,\n. she was placed in the Boulder Sani\n-1 tarium in Colorado, but without\n- avail, the dread disease baffling all\nmedical science that could be obtain\ned for her.\nGovernment Ownership of fiail-^\nrOadS By BEHJ.6.WELCH.\nOne of the popular fallacies ia ref\nerence to railroads is that as they are\nconsolidated it results in higher rates\nand poorer service to the public. No\ngreater mistake was ever made than\nthis. We do not undertake to say\nthat there are no local instances in\nwhich these things may not have re\nsulted but they are so out of propor\ntion to the reverse conditions that\nthey are scarcely worth considering.\nExcept in cases of railroad wars,\nrates are lower to-day than ever be\nfore and with every consolidation\nthe same result follows. If the W.\n& N. B. R. R. was a part of the\nReading or the Lehigh system pas\nsenger rates would be three cents\nper mile instead of four and yet as\nan independent road it cannot afford\nto make rates less than they are.\nIn through freight rates the exist\ning system gives almost the same\nconsolidation for while\nthe roads are separate the through\nrates are made up 011 a consolidated\nbasis that gives us the advantage of\nthe greater earnings on the Trunk\nlines. Bituminous coal is now haul\ned at less than a quarter of a cent\nper ton per mile in some cases. It\nseems hardly possible that this could\never be reduced. It can only be\ndone with heavy tracks, engines and\ncars and so reduced tranportation ex\npenses.\nPassenger facilties on the large\nrailroads are not equaled in any\ncountry in the world either for com\nfort, luxury or moderate cost. It\nseems as if nothing more could be\ndone in these directions or speed and\nyet a year does not go by without\nsome improvement not heretofore\nthought of. Largely those things\nare the fruits of centralization and\ncentralization has only just begun.\nIt would not be safe to say that ten\nyears will go by withouta practical\nconsolidation of all the roads in this\ncountry. As a result traveling fa\ncilities would be improved at prob\nably reduced cost and transportation\nwould be less expensive than it is\nnow.\nThe danger to be apprehended is\nthe autocracy that would be estab\nlished as£a natural sequence. Not\nevery man is fitted to be trusted with\nsuch a sway. Not long since Wall\nStreet hud down the law to the\nTreasury Department jibout certain\nbond issues and the Department sub\nmitted, but when another issue was\nto be made the "people" asked for\nthe privelige of subscribing with the\nresult that some men of very limited\nmeans made small fortunes out of\ntheir subscriptions. It was an ob\nject lesson not to be forgotten. That\nwas financing by the people and the\ngovernment business was done at\nthe government offices, and"it\npaid."\nWe suppose the most complete\nmonopoly in the world is the Oil\nTrust and the writer is of opinion\nthat the cost of oil to consumer has\nbeen reduced because of the concern\ntration of interests that has been\nbrought about, but we believe its\npowers are abused. It ought not to\nbe posssble for any such combination\narbitrarily to increase the cost of one\nof the necessaries of life to working\npeople and at the same time realize\nenormous fortunes every year out of\nit, we might almost say thas fortunes\nare reaped every day. No one has\nyet been inspired to formulate a law\nto meet the case, but if the Socialists\nwill keep on with their revolution\nary appeals it will come some day\nlike a flash of Light just as "contra\nband of war" came to General Benj.\nButler in New Orleans. Probably\nthe day is not far distant. When\nthe Oil Trust can buy up the Texas\nOil Fields over night and put out\nthe fires in thousands of homes, fac\ntories and locomotives with a few\nhours notice it is time for a "John\nthe Baptist" to be heard in the wild\nernes. We have been accustomed to\nbelieve that "a man can do as he\npleases with his own" but it has\n, come to pass that College Chairs are\n. being endowed to find out whether\nwe have not been mistaken, or at\nleast whether a new light has not\n; shone on the subject, and they call\n[ these new teachers " Professors of\n. Sociology." It is only a different\nway of spelling "Socialism" that\'s\n11.\n75 CTS. PER YEAR\nt COMMUNICATION.\nEDITOR, NEWS ITEM:\nWhat\'s the matter with Editor\nNewell anyway? When you and\nyours readers are discussing the ad\nvisability of Government Owner\nship he undertakes to settle the\nwhole matter by declaring that it\nwont pay and that is all there is to\nit. The only argument he has is\nthat the Post Office Department\ndon\'t pay and when somebody tries\nto answer that argument he snarls,\nsays mean things, and replies that\nthe question is not Post Office but\nRailroads and Coal Mines, when all\nthe time he is the fellow who start\ned the Post Office discussion. Let\nhim gi% r e us a reason why the Gov\nernment cannot operate the Rail\nroads or Mines to pay and let him\nleave out his mean flings. They\nare not argument.\nAnswering his assertion that the\nPost Office Department don\'t pay\nlet us make a comparison and ask a\nquestion. A man has an ice pond\nand cuts a hundred tons of ice from\nit—his expenses are twenty-five dol\nlars and he sells eighty tons of it to\nhis neighbors for twenty-four dollars\nand keeps the other twenty for him\nself at a cost of one dollar—does his\nice business pay or is he losing\nmoney?\nThat\'s just what the government\ndoes—it sells post office serviee to\nthe people and gets a little less than\nthe money it pays out but the result\nof it is that its own service for which\nit charges itself nothing costs it the\ntrifling difference like the man with\nthe ice.\nLet Editor Newell give us another\nreason why the Government can\'t\nmake mines and railroads pay and\nthen perhaps some of your corres\npondents can answer him intelligent\nly and it is hoped he will keep his\ntemper, and write in a gentlemanly\nfashion as he knows so well how to\ndo, if he wants to.\nRUSTICUS.\n***** LOPEZ.\nLast Wednesday night two men\nthinking that they were at the\nJackson House made a slight mis\ntake and entered the house of E.

It would\nbe a gross mistake to tamper with the\ntariff. While not hurting the trusts\nmaterially it would throw out of posi\ntion several millions of American la\nborers.\nCan it be possible that women have\nforgotten the agony of lS!t2 to 1597 or\nthat men would willingly leave their\nfamilies again and be compelled to\nseek work in vain in other places, as\nwas the case in those years? Thinking\npeople cannot forget in six short years\nthe unspeakable horror of (J rover\nCleveland\'s last administration, caused\nby a wicked reduction of the tariff.\nThe fact that during the late coal\nstrike no Democrat in position or out\nraised his voice against the outrageous\ntreatment of our coal miners by the\nceil operators demonstrates that they\ndo not care so long as they have plenty\nof campaign material. The Democratic\nleaders cried bitter tears of regret\nwhen they heard that Theodore Roose-\nelt had forced the operators to come\nto Washington and made them consent\nto arbitration upon the strike trouble.\nThe workitiginan can draw his own in\nference as to which are his friends—\nDemocrats or Republicans.\nIt was the unexpected panie during\n< \'le\\ eland\'s reign that caused the wom\nen to wake up to their positions. For\nthe tirst time they saw that politics\nhad everything to do with their com\nfort and happiness. They commenced\nto inquire the cause of the trouble.\nMany men knew as little of its effect\nas their wives. They began to com\np: re the prosperous years under pro\ntection with the free trade slump and\nmade up their minds to put William\nMcKinley in the chair. Never have\nwe known such prosperity or such uni\nversal satisfaction of the workingmen.\n.Mothers, why should you cavil at the\nprice of your children\'s shoes or at the\nfood that they eat when you have more\nthan enough money wherewith to buy\nthem? Why do you complain, O house\nwife, that your servant girl asks $2 or\n,s:j more a month than you have hereto\nfore paid? Don\'t you remember, dear\nlady, that eight years ago times obliged\nyou to discharge your servant because\nof financial shortage? Do you not\nknow that it is always a sign of pros\nperity when the servants suddenly see\nthat their services are in demand every\nwhere? If you want to grumble about\nthe beef and sugar trusts, go ahead,\nbut think well before you chop down\nthe tariff that protects your husband\'s\nearnings and makes your home com\nl\'oris and happiness. Don\'t scold about\ntlie signs of prosperity, sueh as a few\ndollars added to your servant\'s wages,\nor, in fact, any money that you pay out\nand that goes into the pockets of labor.\nSueh things should not distress you.\nDemand, if you will, little grumbler,\nproper legislation as to illegitimate\ntrusts and corporations, and sensible\npeople will be with you. But do not\nargue for free trade as a cure for ag\ngregated capital, for that means a de\nterioration of American industries and\nWill not help the complaint.\nGRACE MILLER WHITE.\nFor What RonnonT\nThe Philadelphia Record, a strenu\nous free trade newspaper, expresses\nthe opinion that if the tariff were tak\nen out of politics by the creation of a\npermanent commission and If congress\nshould be guided by the advice of such\na commission, "after the first year\nthere would not remain protected in\nterests enough to warrant the expenses\nof the body." Herein is to be found\nthe reason why the idea of a nonpollt\nical tariff commission finds favor with\nDemocrats and free traders. It would,\nas they believe, mean the death of\nprotection. Surely Republican business\nmen do not for the same reason favor\nthe nonpolitical tariff commission plan.\nFor what reason, then, should any Re\npublican business man favor it?\nAn Obvious Truth.\nWhatever the Democrats may say,\nthe whole world acknowledges that the\nRepublican party, by its introduction\nof correct business methods, has\nbrought the grandest era of prosperity\nto the United States that hns been giv\nen to any country on the face of the\nglobe.—-Buffalo News.\nSnppltcn I\'tmont Need.\nChrist supplies our utmost spiritual\nneed.

All ownership but God\'s owner\nship Is an attempt to translate a divine\nprerogative onto human ground and\nto work it simply so far as It is work\nable.

There is no theory\nof social life that Is more inclusive or\njust than that of Jesus, and yet it was\nformulated before there was In any\nproper sense a social consciousness.\nThe spirit of Christ\'s teaching Is In\nthe fullest sense the scientific spirit\nBut In contrast with much that Is\ncalled the scientific attitude, It keepa\nto its serene interpretation of those\nbasal elements of human life and char\nacter which are not subject to varia\ntion, but are always expressive of the\nlife problems of the world.—Rev.

Later, on the same day, after\nI had learned to trade with an Indian,\nI bought the skin for $1.50.\n"The secret of trading with the In\ndian is to appear indifferent. The most\nsuccessful trader is the one who goes\nwith a supply of the same article he Is\nmost desirous of buying. The Indian\nsees that the stranger has had experi\nence, and negotiations are carried on\nupon a strictly business basis. An In\ndian refused ?10 for a bow and arrow.\nIt was bought for $1 by a man who\ncan-led several bows and arrows in his\nhand. This wily individual leased the\nsupply from a store in order to im\npress his copper colored friends, and\nhe succeeded.\n"The Indian," said the speaker, tell\ning of traits of character he has ob\nserved in his red friends, "is one of the\nmost faithful followers in the world\nif he has confidence In you.
