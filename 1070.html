S., March 31.—Dr.\nAlexander Graham Bell\'s Aerial Ex\nperiment association, which has been\nengaged in experimental work with\naeroplanes and tetrahedral kites for\nmore than a year was formally dis\nbanded here today.\n"Dr. Bell is more than satisfied with\nthe success attained," said Mr. Curtiss\nyesterday. "He believes the experi\nmental work has accomplished practi\ncally all that was expected. The time\nhas come, however, to branch out on\nbroader lines and several aeroplanes\nwill be built at once on the models\nof the successful machines that have\nbeen tried out in the past year."\nThe association has spen $35,000 in\nits experiments, the greater part of\nwhich was contributed by Mrs. Bell.\nWith Dr. Beil and Mr. Curtiss at\nBaddeck are J. A. D. McCurdy, who\ndesigned the Silver Dart, and F. W.\nBaldwin, a young engineer from To\nronto. These four men comprise the\nassociation membership, but it was\nstarted with five five, the fifth mem\nber being the late Lieut. Selfridge,\nwho was killed in the fall of Orville\nWright\'s machine at Fort Meyer last\nsummer. Dr. Bell was deeply grieved\nby this accident, and, although the\nSilver Dart was especially cnstructed\nto carry two men, Dr. Bell has refus\ned to permit a trial of the aeroplane\nwith a second man. With the disband\nment of the association, however it is\npossible that a flight of the machine\nwith two men will be made in the\nnear future at Hammondsport.\nOf the four aeroplanes built by the\nAerial Experiment association the\nfirst was Lieut. Seifridge\'s Red Wing,\nwhich flew 319-feet on March 12, 1908.\nThis was the first aeroplane to make\na successful public flight in America.\nNext came F. W. Baldwin\'s White\nWing, which flew 1,017 feet on May\n22. The third aeroplane was Glenn\nH. Curtiss\' June Bug, which won the\nScientific American Cup by flying\nover a mile on July 4,. The Silver\nDart, managed by Mr. McCurdy, was\nthe most successful of all. It flew four\nand one-half miles a week ago at Bad\ndeck, and Mr. Curtiss is confident it\nwill exceed this record soon.\n"Some valuable experiments were\nmade at Baddeck, while I was there,\nwith propellers attached to iceboats,"\nsaid Mr. Curtiss yesterday. "The in\nvestigations made with motors have\nalso been highly successful, and plans\nhave been made for two new motors,\none of twenty-five and the other of\nfifteen horuse power, which will be\nfitted to the new aeroplanes that are\nto be finished early in May.\na\nin\nin\nit\ners\nter.\nMEXICO SUSPENDS\nDUTY ON WHEAT\nEL PASO, Texas., March 31.—This\nis the last day for wheat duties from\nMexico in order to prevent a bread\nfamine, according to customs officials\nhere.\nFor several years past Mexico has\nhad to suspend the duty on wheat\neach spring on account of the short\nage in that country.\nWheat now costs $3.60 Mexican\nmoney per bushel in ,Mexiro City\nwhen imported from the United States\nand the home crop is exhausted.\nAmerican wheat at the border now\ncosts $.28 a bushel, and with a duty\nof 20 cents gold a bushel and an addi\ntional freight rate to Mexico City, the\nprice is exorbitant.\nNOTICE.\nto\ndate\nJTled as provided geant,\nf poral\nland, this March ment\nfour\nCity Marshal. 1 tor\'s\nNotice Is hereby given that the own\ners of all dogs allowed to run at large\nwill be required to comply with Ordi\nnances Nos. 115 wind 173^ with refer\nence to paying tl a taxi\ning their dogs alb wed^o run at large,\nor the dogs will t s\nIn said ordinance.\nGiven under m; i\n15, 190*. *\nand muzzel\nJ. P. WILLIAMS,\nt\nWILL GOV. HOKE SMITH\nAPPROVE TWIGGS FARM?\nr\nATLANTA, Ga., Mar. 31.—Will the\ngovernor approve or disapprove the\nfarm selected by the prison commis\nsion to be purchased by the state for\nthe use of white convicts?\nThis is the all-absorbing question\nat the state capitol now, and a divis\nion of opinion relative thereto exists.\nOne thing is virtually certain, how\never,and it is that if the farm recom\nmended is not purchased none will be\nbought for the present. White prison\ners will be distributed\nthe\namong\ncounties once, and the farm matter\nwill go over until later in the year.\nIt is stated on good authority that\nthe governor has employed two ex\nperienced and reliable men to make\nan investigation of the property which\nhas been recommended, and his de\ncision will probably he governed in\nlarge part by their report. They art\nINCREASE MAXIMUM RATES\nRICHMOND, Va., March 31.—The\nstate corporation commission having\nhanded down an opinion in favor of\nthe railroads in the matter of the pe\ntition of the common carriers increas\ning the maximum rate from two cents\na mile or two and a half cents, all the\nroads in the state which have been\noperating under the two-cent maxi\nmum rate will now go on the basis\nof two and a half cents.\nThe commission is not unanimous\nin its award, Judge Prentis and Col\nonel Willard voting for the increase\nas asked by the roads and Judge Rhea\ndissenting and urging that the old\nrate is now, to his mind, unreasonable\nor unjust. He holds that before any\nincrease whatever is permitted the\nroads should give assurance that they\nwill place on sale and keep on sale\nbooks to be sold at two cents a mile,\nsaid books to be fer local travel or in\nterchangeable. Ho also expressed the\nbelief that the roads should give this\nassurance before any action is taken\nlooking to the termination of the\npresent rate cases in the federal\ncourts.\nit\nin\nof\nbe\ncourts.\nThe order of the commission pro\nvides that the special rates as to mile\nage books and traveling parties be\nretained.* The mileage books will be\ninterchangeable and good on any road\nin the state. The opinion makes no\nreference to this, but it is embraced\nin the order of the commission.\nCopies of the order will be transmit\nted to all the railroads at once. These\nwill have to be printed in full and !\nposted in all stations 10 days before\nit can become operative. The law\nnow goes into effect.\nlit\nIN PRICE OF COAL\nNEW YORK,\ncoal dealers in this city said that they\nwere beginning to receive inquiries\nfrom customers as to whether the cus\ntomary reduction of 50 cents a ton in\nthe price of domestic anthracite will\ntake place on April 1, the queries be\ning prompted by the talk of a strike.\nThe dealers say it is Impossible to\nadvise them now, but they believe\nthat unless an agreement is reached\nbetween the operators and the anthra\ncite miners before the present one ex\npires there will be no reduction in\nprice.\nThe reduction is made to the deal\ners by the operators and to the con\nsumers by the dealers on April 1 to in\nduce the people to lay in their wniter\nsupplies of domestic anthracite in the !\nsummer months, when it is easier to 1\nmine and handle coal than in the win\nter.\nMarch 31.—Several\nAPPOINTED FDR\nARMY SCHOOLS\nLONDON, March 31.—It has been\ndecided as an experimental measure\nto appoint at once forty actinf school\nmaster sergeants for duty In the army\nschools situated at depots A candi\ndate must be under the tank of ser\ngeant, and if below the rank of cor\nporal he must have held the appoint\nment of laim -eorpoi al for\nfour months.

These are the Greer property\nin Turner county, the Parker proper\nty in Tift, and the Smith property in\nLaurens. His purpose in this is said\nto be to gain information that can be\nhad by comparing the places from\nwhich the final selection was made.\nIf the place is approved the prison\ncommissioners will take prompt steps\nto put it in operation without any de\nlay.\nThe prisoners will be quartered\nwithout the use of tents.
