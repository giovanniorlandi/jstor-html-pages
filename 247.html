Upon the completion of\nhis term at the California pen he\nwas returned to this instution to\nfinish an eight year sentence he\nhaving only served three months\nwhen he escaped.\nFrom the old statutes it appear s\ntnat his sentence was running a!l\nthe time he wns serving in San\n(Jiintin. The la* has since been\namended. The question is will\nLane benefit under the old law\nthat sent him to prison in ?his\nstat". If be does benefit under\nthis ancient law he will only have\nto serve h comparatively short\ntime. He has an attorney looking\ninto the matter.\nOn the other hand the author\nities at Hed llluff are looking for\nhim.

Mr.\nWise had returned from McGill\nwhere he had been doing some\nwork for the past fe.v days. Hi\nreached East Ely on twe 6:20\ntrain, and was carrying ?5000 on\ncoin in a sack on his shoulder and\nhad in an inner pocket $13,000 on\nchecks and currcncy. An\nelctric storm was raging and the\ncrowds on East Ely\'s Main street\nhad been attracted by the wonder\nful effects, and watch the chain\nli/htning zig zagtfing through the\nheavens. Of a sudden there was\na startling blast ar.d the lights in\ntown were extinguished. Light\nning had struck a disused tele\nphone pole a short distance from\nthe depot, just after Mr. Wise had\np\'ssed by. He was staggered by\ntlu* shock, the sack of money fall\nin,: to the ground, and he just\nsaved himself from falling to the\nsirk walk.\n11 is first impression was that he\nhad been attacked, the purpose\nbeir.g to rob him of the money he\nwas carrying to the Copper\nNational bank.\nNo one was anywhere in sight\nand it finally dawned upon him\nthat he had been shocked by\nilghtning. Then people began\nrushing into th* street and he was\njoined by a tinmher of friends. He\nsaid that he felt a sting in the\nback of the head as jf he had been\nstruck by some blunh instrument\nand apart from a little nervous\nness, he expressed no further\ndamage.\nA strange coincidence in connec\ntion with the experience, was that\nonly the day before he had receive\na letter from his mother, narrat\ning an encounter of his sister-in\nlaw and her mother a few days\nbefore in Nebrasks. The ladies\nwere out driving when a storm\ncame up. The horse was struck\nby lightoing and instantly killed\nand the occupants of the buggy\nthrown to the ground in an un\nconscious condition. They re\nmained there for nearly an hour\nwher. a searching party discovered\nthem. The shock confined them to\ntheir beds for the next few days\nbut nothing serious developed. ?\nWhite Pine News.\nTHE LARGEST UNO OLDEST\nLIVING THINGS IN THE WORLD\nThe big trees (Sequoia gigantea)\nare found only in the Sierra\nNevada range at an altitude of\nfrom :;500 to 8000 feet. They\nare the largest and oldest living\nthinps m the world. Their only\nnear relative in the Sequoia sem\npervirens found in the Coast Hanjfe\nof California. The big trees of\nthe Sierra Nevada irrow to an\naltitude of 340 feet and have a\nbase circumference of over 100\nfeet.\nThe hark sometime exceeds\nforty inches in thickness, \'l he hig\ntrees unquestionably antedated\nthe Christian era. The age is\ndetermined hy counting the\nannular rings from the center,\neach ring indicating a year\'s\ngrowth. When John Mnir best\nknown of California\'s scientists,\ncarefully examined a tree burned\npart way through it was found to\nhr over 3000 years of age.\nIt is believed that many of them\ngreatly excel d that age, at d the\npresident of Stanford University\nthinks there is no reason why the\noldest of them should not have\nbeen living 70(W or 8000 years.\nThe trunks of the big tree is\ncolumnar, fluted perpendicularly,\nand in appearance and color\nvaries from a v??ry light brown\nto cinnamon.

That is the\nfact that th.? very secjrity of the\nstee> car to those who ride in it is\nan added danger to thoie wl o are\nin the wooden "ars in the same]\ntrain, because in the case of a\nhead-on collision the momentum J\nof the train is exrerded in crush\ning the weakest elements of the\ntrain.\nTo make up trains partly of steel j\nc>.rs and partly of wooden cars is\ntleiefore rolbirg Pctrr to pay ,\nPaul.

The steel car lpsts\nlonger an i c sts le.is for upkeep,\nand its use would probably be an\neconomy instead of an additional\nexpense to the railroad con -\npanies. as it certainly is to life\nand limb.\nDEGREES BELOW ZERO\n"I asked an Alaskan pioneer\nwho was crossing to his old home\nin Sweden what happened when\nthe thermometer goes down to 60\nand HO degrees below zero" said\nMarshall J.

S. Ryan and the\nMorgan Guggenheim syndicate of ? r\nthe land-grabbers by proclamation ?\nincluding. it in the Chugach ?\nNational Forest. I\nOn the 20th of April 1911 th" i >\ncountry was shocked to learn that 1\non the 2>>th of October. 1910 s\nPresident Taft had signed an \' t\nExecutive order reversing the i\naction of Presiden\' Roosevelt, <\nand, turowing oven 12,800 acres of t\nland, covering the water front of t\nController Hay, the only avilable t\nnatural harbor affording an\napproach to the coal fields in ,\nwhich were located the fraudulent t\nCunningham claims.\nIt was th 3 utual practice of (\nPresident Roosevelt and of other ,\nPresidents, whenever they restored j\npublic land to entry and sale, to ]\ndo so by proclamation, not by ? i\nExcutive order, and to include in\nsuch proclamation a provision that (\nthe land thus restored to entry\nand sale should not he subject to\nentry for GO days after the date of j\nproclamation restoring it to entry,\nthus giving ample public notice to\nall people who migh desire to file\non such lands.\n<\nThese Executive precedents j ?\nwere violated in reversing Roose- | (\nvelt\'s order and \'estoring the 1 .\nController Bay lands to private\nentry. This the President did by j\nsecret Executive order and rot by\n?\nproclamation.\nMr. Freil Dennett, Commissioner\nof the General Lard C fV.< e, test\nified Jaly 10, 1911. before the j |\nHouse Committee on Expenditure! \'\nin the Department of the Interim j,\nthat the Executive order a:s\noriginally prepared f- r the Presi\ndent\'s signature, contained the\nusual GO-day notice to prospective\nsettlors but was omitted from the\nExecutive order when finally ( |\nsi.^no 1 by the Presi lent.\nAn Executive order restoring\nland to entry is merely trans- ! i\nmitted to the land ofiiee and to the\nhead of various bureaus. In this\ncase the Executive order was\nissued October \'J8, 11)11. It was\nnot made public. It was five day\nthereafter b fore it was put in thu\nnails to be transmitted to the land ( :\nnfTice at Juneau, Alaska.\nThis is what v\\ as being done in j\nWashington. Turn now to Aatska.\nIt is now known that on the very j\nday the order was mailed iri\nWashington James J. Ryan, a \'\nbrother of Richard H^an, with\ndummy entrymen went upon and I\nbegan survey of the lands front\ning on Controller Hay and filed \'\nupon the particular water fror.t ;\nwhich commands practically the j\none approach, and hence, in\neffect, constitutes the key to the i\ncoal fields in which were located ! i\nth? Cunningham claims. I\nThat he kne.v in n l.anee that\nthere was n scheme a font here in I\nI\nWashington to withdraw the Con\ntroller Bay lands from the forest\nreserve and throw them opi-n to\nentry, that he was advisid step hy\nstep as the scheme was con\nsummated, and received advice\ndirect from Washington the very\nday the President signed the order\nseems beyond question. The\nnearest telegraph station is 100\nmiles from Controller May. James\n.1. Ryan must have had all prepara\ntion made, his surveyors engaged\nand in waiting and ready to move\nwhen the word came from Wash\nington. I\nWhy the President did not issue\nm proelaatio.i and make his\nrelease of these lands public\nremains a mystery.\nWhy there was omitted ftom his\norder opening these lands to entry\nthe (50-day provision, within which\nno tiling could be mnde upon this\nlands is not know.\nHow .lames J.
