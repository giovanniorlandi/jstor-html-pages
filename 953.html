        <pre>["FRANCE AND BELGIUM 285\nernment entertains pacific relations,” and \nwhile Rakovsky himself argued that the \nstatement challenged concerned only a \nhypothetical case, the French conservative \npress carried on a violent campaign for the \nrecall of the Red envoy. Le Figaro, Le \nJournal des Debats, La Liberte, La Vic- \ntoire were especially outspoken, and kept up \na running fire which M. Briand managed \nto ignore and succeeded in having the Min\xad\nistry disregard. However, after refusing to \nyield to the pressure of the Nationalists, \nthe Cabinet finally seemed to come to the \nconclusion that it might, by persuasion, ob\xad\ntain from the Soviet Government, in its \nown good time, the recall of the indiscreet \nAmbassador in order to pursue usefully \nsome negotiations now pending between the \ntwo Governments.\nAmong these is the recent offer of the \nSoviet Government to settle with French' \nbondholders on the basis of the payment of \n61,000,000 gold francs over a period of \nsixty-one years. The Russian debt is esti\xad\nmated at 23,000,000,000 francs. While Max \nLitvinov, the Russian Commissioner, proudly \nstated that the French Commission had ac\xad\ncepted the principle of the payment in ex\xad\nchange for a commercial credit of $20,000,- \n000 a year for six years, the French Govern\xad\nment did not confirm that view. The \nFrench public seemed also less enthusiastic \nthan M. Litvinov, remembering that be\xad\nfore the October revolution Russia paid \nto the French 400,000,000 gold francs in \ninterest alone, and that now even Turkey \nis paying nearly 50 per cent, of her debts.\nEx-President Millcrand, who, after his\ndefeat at the Senatorial elections of Paris, \nseemed resigned to retire from active poli\xad\ntics, has made his re-entry into public life. \nCandidate for a seat in the Senate that \nhas become vacant in the Department of \nOrne, he delivered a long address at Alen- \n?on on Sept. 15, setting forth political views \nvery much in harmony with the conserva\xad\ntive temper of that region, but quite at vari\xad\nance with the doctrines with which his name \nused to be associated before the war.\nEVEN TS IN  BELG IU M\nBELGIUM— The Good-Will Expedition of \nthe American Legion arrived in Brus\xad\nsels on Oct. 2. Commander Savage placed a \nwreath on the tomb of the Unknown Sol\xad\ndier and the whole party visited the field \nof Waterloo on Oct. 3. A banquet was \ngiven in their honor on Oct. 5. Premier \nJaspar, who presided, asserted that Bel\xad\ngium would never forget the part the \nUnited States played in the World War \nand during the peace negotiations. “ It was \ndue in part to America’s efforts that Bel\xad\ngium’s independence and national integrity \nwere guaranteed during the Peace Confer\xad\nence,”  he said. The California delegation \npresented the Government with 100 Cali\xad\nfornia redwood trees, to be planted as a \nmemorial in the historic forest of Seignes.\nLouis Franck, Governor of the National \nBank, arriving in America on Sept. 7, said \nthat conditions in Belgium were good, both \nfinancially and industrially, and that there \nwas practically no unemployment.\nTHE TEUTONIC COUNTRIES\nGermany Celebrates Hindenburg/s Eightieth.\nBirthday\nBy HARRY J. CARMAN\nA ssociate P rofessor of H istory, Columbia U niversity ;\nC urrent H istory A ssociate\nRELIGIOUS and political animosities \nand class distinctions of every sort \nwere in large measure momentarily \nobliterated on Oct. 2, when all Germany \njoined in paying honor to Paul von Hinden- \nburg, President of the German Republic \nand former Marshal of the Imperial armies. \nThe occasion was his eightieth birthday,\nand the demonstration accorded him rivaled \nthe imposing spectacles of the old Imperial \ndays.\nThe festivities, which began at an early \nhour, continued throughout the day. At 8 \no’clock military bands gave a concert in \nfront of the Wilhelmstrasse Palace. Next, \nthe President went to church, where he re\xad\n", '286 CURRENT HISTORY, NOVEM BER, 1927\nceived the diplomats and military officials. \nAfter a short pause for lunch, he motored \nalong five miles of closely packed, wildly \ncheering crowds to Berlin’s great stadium \non the outskirts of the city, where he was \ntumultuously greeted by a huge concourse, \nincluding 40,000 school children. The sta\xad\ndium and the avenues leading to it, as well \nas the public buildings, were gaily bedecked. \nThe crowds included squads of war veterans \ncovered with medals and bearing regimental \nbanners of every color of the rainbow, and \nthere were also large delegations represent\xad\ning the Stahl Helm, the Jung Deutsch and \nother reactionary organizations. Officers \nof the old German Army in full gala uni\xad\nforms, and even wearing the old spiked \nhelmets of the Hohenzollcrn days, were \ninterspersed with light-hearted peasant men \nand women in genuine peasant garb, who \nhad come all the way from Bavaria, Suabia \nand other far-away regions, to pay homage \nto their national hero. The stadium festivi\xad\nties, simple but impressive, included a song \nprogram by the children. The day closed \nwith a banquet to the President of the Of\xad\nficers’ League, at which he wore the uni\xad\nform of a Field Marshal and practically all \nhis decorations.\nIn reply to Chancellor Marx, who voiced \nthe greetings of the Government and the \nGerman people and eulogized the Presi\xad\ndent’s devotion to duty and Christian \ncitizenship, the President made an earnest \nplea for national unity. “ My deepest \nthoughts at this hour,”  he said further, “ are \ndevoted to our compatriots in the Rhineland \ndistricts who, to our regret, have not been \nrelieved from foreign occupation. I greet \nthem with a sad heart, and the wish and \nhope that the land on the Rhine may soon \nregain its liberty. To accomplish this will \nbe the foremost purpose of German policy.”\nThe day was significant because of the \nlively warfare going on in Germany con\xad\ncerning what flag is really the national \nflag, the black, red and gold, which are \nthe official republican colors, or the black, \nred and white of old Imperial Germany. \nDisinterested onlookers expressed the opin\xad\nion that if the matter were left to the \nBerlin crowds, the old Imperial colors \nwould win easily.\nGeneral Ludendorff’s “Tannenberg Bund” \nrefused to participate in the celebration \nbecause President von Hindenburg had al\xad\nlowed Chancellor Marx to stand with him \non the tribune on the occasion of the un\xad\nveiling of the Tannenberg monument a \nfortn ight earlier. The Rcichsbanner, the \nStrong republican organization numbering\nabout 3,000,000 members, also declined to \nbe officially represented on the ground that \ntoo much prominence was being given to \nHindenburg, the warrior, and not sufficient \nto the man as President of the Republic.\nAll the Red counter-demonstrations failed \ncompletely, and the only disorder was a \nclash between the Stahl Helm and the \nCommunists, in which 300 of the latter \nwere arrested.\nAn interesting episode occurred in Vien\xad\nna, where 75,000 people, who assembled to \ncelebrate the German President’s birthday, \ntook occasion to emphasize Austria’s kin\xad\nship with Germany and Austria’s right to \nself-determination. The Austrian Govern\xad\nment was not officially represented at the \ngathering, but members of the Pan-German \nparty in Parliament were present. Count \nLerchenfeld, German Minister to Austria, \nresponded to repeated calls from the crowds \nfor a German spokesman by reciprocating \nAustria’s aspirations and declaring that \nGermany would always welcome her sister \nState into a new federated Teutonic realm.\nOn Sept 18 President Hindenburg repudi\xad\nated for the first time, publicly and offi\xad\ncially, the charge that Germany was re\xad\nsponsible for the World War. The occasion, \nalready referred to, was the unveiling at\nThe real basis of the Franco-German commer\xad\ncial treaty\n—Pasquino, Turin\n', "THE TEUTONIC COUNTRIES 287\nTannenberg, East Prussia, of a national war \nmemorial to commemorate the Marshal’s \nvictory in the early days of the conflict \nwhen the Russian invasion was frustrated. \nFrantic applause interrupted his speech \nwhen he demanded the judgment of an im\xad\npartial tribunal on the question of Ger\xad\nmany’s war guilt, and long, lusty cheers \ngreeted him when he concluded his dedica\xad\ntory utterance.\nBaron Ago von Maltzan, German Ambas\xad\nsador to the United States, was killed or. \nSept. 23 when a Lufthansa passenger plane \ncrashed from a height of 500 feet near \nSchleiz, Thuringia. The Baron was flying \nfrom Berlin to Munich, where, at the time \nof the accident, his wife and little daughter \nwere on the flying field awaiting his arrival. \nThe accident, the most terrible in the his\xad\ntory of the Lufthansa air traffic service, \ncost the lives of three other passangers and \nof the pilot and the mechanic, leaving no \nsurvivors. Official and social circles on \nboth sides of the Atlantic were stunned and \nsaddened by the tragedy.\nThe special session of the Reichstag, \nscheduled for Oct. 17, was called o ff by the \nFederal Council on Sept. 15 in order to \ngive the framers of the Federal School bill \nanother fortnight to complete their work. \nHaving mixed politics, religion and educa\xad\ntion into one dish, Germany’s parliamen\xad\ntarians are finding the greatest difficulty \nin making that dish palatable to the various \ntastes of the different constituents. While \nthe Communists and Socialists believe that \nreligion and education should not be mixed \nand object to institutions where religion \nis part of the curriculum, their voting \npower is overwhelmed by supporters of the \nsectarian and non-sectarian school idea. \nThe sectarians, however, are unable to \nagree, the Protestants charging that the \nbill as now drawn gives the Catholics too \nmuch power.\nOnly eight days are provided for discuss\xad\ning the school bill on its first reading, after \nwhich the special session will be adjourned \nuntil later. Its final passage, it is be\xad\nlieved, will not come for several years, one \nreason being that the political parties are \nso greatly perturbed over the effect of the \nschool bill on next year’s general elections, \nwhen each of the dozen parties desires to \nimpress the nation at large with its power \nand influence. The only other State matter \nwhich will be considered during the short \nspecial session is the question of an increase \no f salaries for civil service employes.\nThat Germany, despite the efforts of the \nframers of the Versailles Treaty, has suc\xad\nceeded in building warships which, in pro\xad\nportion to tonnage, are easily the most for\xad\nmidable fighting craft in the world, is the \nstatement made by the well-informed naval \ncorrespondent of the London Daily News. \nHe gives facts and figures designed to dem\xad\nonstrate that the latest German cruisers \nKonigsburg and Karlsruhe, launched last \nyear, could overwhelm cruisers of much \nlarger size, and are better than anything \nof their proportions in the British and \nAmerican fleets. The Germans themselves \ncall these cruisers ivunderschiffe (wonder- \nships). Their hulls are built of special \nsteel, combining lightness with great \nstrength; and electric welding, used instead \nof rivets, lessens their weight. At high \nspeeds the vessels are driven by geared tur\xad\nbines of 65,000 shaft horsepower working \non high-pressure steam from six oil-burn\xad\ning boilers. At full power their speed is \nat least thirty-two knots, but when the \nships are cruising they will run on Diesel \nmotors and carry enough oil to travel 6,000 \nmiles. Their armament, extraordinary \nboth in power and distribution, consists of \nnine 6-inch Krupp guns, firing 101-pound \nshells at an extreme range on high-angle \nmounting of 20,000 yards. The guns are \nhoused in triple turrets, three guns in each \nturret being loaded and fired together as \nthough they were a three-barreled gun. At \neach broadside nine 6-inch projectiles are \ndischarged, and owing to their rapid rate \nof fire, nine salvos can be fired every min\xad\nute. Six guns can be brought to bear on \na pursuer and mines can be dropped \nthrough a stern hatch. Although 6,000-ton \nships, the Konigsberg and Kai'lsruhe have \na broadside of nine 6-inch guns, as against \nsix 6-inchcrs on British cruisers 2,000 tons \nlarger. They are faster than even the new \n10,000-ton British cruisers, so that they \ncould not only overwhelm cruisers of much \nlarger size, but run away from almost \neverything else.\nAt a convention of city officials which \nopened at Magdeburg on Sept. 23, attended \nby Chancellor Marx and a number of pres\xad\nent and former Cabinet members, the May\xad\nors and Chamberlains of practically all the \nlarge cities of the Reich immediately voiced \na demand for a revision of the present taxa\xad\ntion system. The combative spirit of the \nassemblage became evident from the start, \nfor the Chancellor’s address was repeatedly \ninterrupted by a small group of Socialist \nand Communist representatives. Dr. Marx \nstressed the necessity for tax equalization \nand the largest possible measure of self- \ngovernment for the cities, but this did r.ot\n", '288 CURRENT HISTORY, NOVEMBER, 1927\nsuit the radical Opposition. President Mulert \nin his opening speech bitterly attacked Hjal- \nmar Schacht’s loan policy, accusing the \nReichsbank head of favoring the great in\xad\ndustrial combinations at the expense of the \nmunicipalities.\nEconomically Germany during the month \nunder review continued to improve. Accord\xad\ning to figures announced on Sept. 25, steel \nproduction was 1,420,253 metric tons, \nagainst 1,142,664 tons in August, 1926. In \nthe foreign trade statement for August, \nhowever, the export of manufactured goods \non which the foreign trade balance must \nultimately depend, declined slightly.\nThe publicly supported unemployed were \nstated to have numbered 403,949 on Sept. \n1, as against 420,174 on Aug. 15, but there \nmust be added to these figures about 150,- \n000 receiving so-called “crisis support.”  On \nOct. 1 a new unemployment insurance law \nwent into effect which transferred the \nwhole financial burden from the shoulders \nof the public and the States to those of \nemployers and employed.\nAUSTRIA—Reverberations of the Vienna \n■A riots of last July continue to disturb \nthe political horizon of Vienna. To pre\xad\nvent their recurrence, the National Govern\xad\nment has taken certain precautionary steps. \nThese include, in the first place, an order \ndirecting that in the future all policemen \nshall be armed with revolvers and twenty- \nfive rounds of ammunition, instead of with \nthe comparatively harmless swords with \nwhich they were formerly equipped. These \nrevolvers will be supplemented with short \nstabbing daggers. The polic# will also have \nat their disposal two armored tanks which \nhave already been ordered from England. \nThe Government has, furthermore, prohib\xad\nited all street parades or demonstrations \nfor the time being.\nThe Social Democrats bitterly resent \nthese precautionary measures. They have \nlong been accustomed to street parades as \na means of demonstrating their strength, as \nmany as four or five parades being held \nmonthly. They are also anxious to curb \nthe Government police. Indeed, they are \nagain demanding that Herr Schober, Vienna \npolice head, who, they assert, is in large \nmeasure responsible for the Vienna riots, \nresign office. Speaking on Sept. 12 before \none of the twenty-four monster mass- \nmeetings called in protest against the \nmethods of Government police, Burgomaster \nReitz of Vienna declared that Schober had \noutlived his usefulness as head of the \nVienna police. He also stated that as a reTHE\nFRENCH TROOPS IN GERMANY \nIf wi l l n i wul  goes on at this rate, the last \ntroops will look like this\n—Ulk, Berlin\nsuit of the police activities last July, 7,500 \nbourgeois had enrolled as Social Democrats, \nand that 13,000 Roman Catholics had de\xad\nserted Chancellor Seipel, head of the Chris\xad\ntian Social Party.\nHOLLAND—Jonkheer Belaerts van Blok- \nland, Foreign Minister, was the first \nmember of the League Assembly to bring up \nthe important question of disarmament. He \ndeclared at the opening meeting on Sept. 6 \nthat moral and practical disarmament was \nnot only the prime mission of the League \nbut also a subject now absorbing the \nthought of the whole world. Therefore the \nspirit of the Geneva protocol should be \nbrought up to date in the form of new \nresolutions to be adopted by the Assembly.\nThe Dutch Parliament was opened on \nSept. 20 by Queen Wilhelmina. The speech \nfrom the throne stated that the country’s \ncapacity for agricultural production was in\xad\ncreasing but that trade and industry were \nstill experiencing great difficulties; that the \nfinancial situation demanded care, as heavy \ntaxation retarded the revival of prosperity \nand the extension of opportunities for work.\n']</pre>
