The Nazi [\n, leader shouted that most of the\n: injustices of the Versailles Treaty\nhad been righted.\nI Eighty million Germans had\nawaited the Fuehrer’s speech with\nuncertainty. Factories, offices J\nand businesses in general were\'\nj ordered closed for its duration. ■\ni Thousands of loudspeakers were 1\nset up all over Germany,\ni Runnnig translation of the\'\nspeech follows: .j\ni “This nation is celebrating a\ngreat victory”, Fuehrer Hitler j\ntold the German people. “After j\ntwo weeks the greater parts of the I\nPolish army had been destroyed”. I\nThe Fuehrer said he had given\'\norders not to sacrifice lives need-.j\nlessly, but that the Polish govern- j\nment forced this on its troops. He \\\nsaid the whole city of Warsaw \'\nhad been turned into a fortress, j\n) Hitler extolled the courage of 1\nthe German soldiers and told of i\nthe countless prisoners they had j\ncaptured. German losses, accord- I\ning to the Nazi leader, were 10,-\'\n527 dead,, with, -30,00(1 wounded.\n1 “All Polish economic problems\nhad to result in war”, he declar\n: od, and further “the minorities\n•in Poland were barbarously\ntreated”.\n; Hitler ridiculed the hailing of\nthe Polish state as a democracy.\nHe said only 50 percent of the\n, people backed up the Polish\nI regime. “In 1933-34, I made every\neffort to bring about an agree\nment with Poland but the govern\njment rejected all pleas”, he said,\nj Since 1922 millions of Germans\njhad to leave Poland and every\n| attempt to solve this problem was\n\'met with reverses by the Polish\ngovernment, the Fuehrer stated,\nj He said that Poland could afford\n,to refuse negotiations because it\nwas backed up by England and\nFrance.\n• Hitler shouted that journalistic\nwarmongers claimed the German!\narmy was utterly inefficient, but\nsaid that this opinion is not shared !\n(by any English general.\n! Now, with the Polish state fal\nlen in two weeks because of the\nworking agreement between Ger\nmany and Russia, there is now 1\nlacking any reason for further\nhostilities. “The Western Pow\n; ers”. Hitler said, “would like to i\nplay Germany and Russia against\neach other” but that these two\n; countries has “every reason to co\n• operate with each other”.\n“It has been claimed that Ger\nmany seeks world domination”,\nj the Fuehrer bellowed forth.

Hitler then accused the Ver\nsailles peacemakers of not having\nthe slightest idea of the basic\nprinciples of forming a free state\nin Poland”, and then declared,\n[ accompanied by a burst of ap\nplause, that he had given “the\n. German people my word of honor\njito. remove the injustices of the\ntreaty of Versailles”. He said the\n\'German people had the right to\ndemand the return of- their\n[ [colonies, and emphasized that the\nGerman’s revenge\' of the treaty is\nExtraordinarily limited. Then he\ndeclared, that the greatest injus\ntices of the treaty had been re\nmoved.\nTurning to the question of being\nja good neighbor, the Reichstag\nspeaker said that Germany was\non friendly relations with Den\njmark and would make no de\nmands on her; it would continue\njto have friendly relations with\nBelgium, and that Germany has\n[never had the slightest\' trouble\n[with Switzerland. Hitler also\nstated that Yugoslavia had been\n[notified that her borders would\nbe respected and that the friend-\nrelations exist between\n[Germany and Italy.\n|. In regard to France, the. only\n[trouble that existed was the ques\ntion of the return of the Saar\n1 area and that has been settled. No\n(further demands ever would be\n• made on that country, Hitler stat\njed, continuing to aver that he\nhad accepted the conditions of\nand wiehes not to see every\nsecond generation of Frenchmen\nand Germans combating in war.\nAt this point, Hitler made what\nis considered the outstanding ut\nterance of his speech. “I con\nsider it the goal of my life to\nbring about friendly relations\nwith England”, he said, although\nthe statement was tempered by\nthe qualifying remark, “I still\nthink there can be peace in Eu\nrope only if there is an under\nstanding between England and\nGermany”.\nDer Fuehrer spoke of the peace\nhe has made with Russia and his\nconstant concern for the welfare\nof his country. Considerable\ncomments were heard on the sub\nject of his “prestige” and reports\nfrom abroad that he was weaken\ning. “I am not a coward, as his\ntory will surely record”, he said.\nAsa means to bring about solu\n[ tion of world problems. Hitler\n\'stated that a solution “is only\npossible in the framework of\nuniversal cooperation”. He said\n“some dav Europe will have to\nsolve these problems” and that\nI “it is impossible for a conference\nIto meet under the roar of can\nnons”. The Fuehrer stated “one\nlof the questions is the clarifica\ntion of armaments, gas, subma\nrines, etc”.\nThe conclusion of the speech\ndealt on the problems that must\nbe solved, the Jewish problem\n1 and the Polish problem. “The\nGerman people consider that the\nVersailles Treaty is dead. They\ndemand the return of Germany’s\ni colonies”.

We got that in 1917.\nOur old enemy Przemysl, (pronounced\nPzhegamish-1 if that’s any help) a place\nthat belonged to Russia during the World\n-War but was incorporated with Poland in\nthe Versailles Treaty, is bobbing up again.\nThis time, of course, as a friend of the\n•Allies. ’ . 1 •\'■\'V- v ;\nSeymour Weiss, one of the three prin\ncipal heirs to the powerful political ma\nchine left by Huey Long has finally be\ncome enmeshed in the web of the law and\nwill have to serve time in the penitentiary.\nWeiss was not so wise after all, and\n. Jionesty remains the best policy.\nThe column “Key West in Days Gone\nfly” announced a surprise party for Brax\n~ton B. Warren on reaching his 62nd birfch\n~day, ten years ago. A few days back The\nCitizen gave an account of a delightful\ndinner in his honor on his 72nd birthday.\nThis column anticipates the pleasure of\nchronicling County Commissioner War\n- ren’s 82nd birthday anniversary 10 years\nhence. . : . ,\nAt the last session of Congress it de\ncided, after long debate, to place em\nbargoes on munitions and implements of\nwar. Now President Roosevelt has con\nvened Congress to debate the question\nrtrair, with his objective to have the em\nbargoes lifted, and anew neutrality law\nenacted, permitting the sale of arms and\nammunition to the belligerents on a cash\nand carry basis. Let America retain its\nembargo and sell goods only to neutrals\n—former customers of England, France\nand Germany. It is the surest way to keep\nns out of war, and tjie most profitable.\nTO WIN—ALL MUST REGISTER!\n. v\nAnd vote, too!\nReferring, of course, to the coming\nCity Election on November 14.\nOne hears this statement. “I don’t\nvote in municipal elections. It’s just a\nwaste of time and effort”.\nAnother states—“lt’s all cut and\ndried. You just can’t change things here\nin Key West”.\nAgain. “Look who’s running. Might\nas well not vote as cast a ballot for that\nbunch”.\nAnd so on and so on. Ad infinitum.\nA repetition of conditions that have been\nduplicated hundreds of times in as many\nother cities in the U. S. What is im\nportant, though, is that despite statements\nof this kind, live, aggressive efforts on the\npart of civid-minded citizens have won out.\nThe same results are hoped for in the com\ning election.\nThere is a theoretical vote of about\n4,500 in Key West. At present, it is said,\nthere are a few more than 3,000 on the\nregistration books. There may be another\ntwo or three hundred names added to the\nlist before election day, that is, if nothing\nis done to awaken a big share of the mar\nginal citizens to the absolute necessity of\nregistering and voting.\nMarginal citizens, in this instance,\nare those that traditionally “stay at\nhome”.* They make statements like the\nabove. They’re in favor of a change—\n“sure, we’d like to see something done\nabout our city government”—but, trag\nically, they don’t do anything about it.\nIt’s a sure bet that the “usual type”\ncandidates will see to it that their friends\nwill register—and vote, too. To counter\nact that condition, and it is possible be\nlieve you us, organization of support for\n“right type” candidates should be ef\nfected. The Citizen understands that\nsuch a movement is under way. It be\nlieves that the sooner evidence of that\nprocedure is brought into light, the better.\nFive more weeks remain in which to\nturn the tide of the election. Every citi\nzen of Key West—every property owner\nand taxpayer—every church member and\norganization supporter—must take it upon\nhimself to register for the election. It will\nbe to the everlasting shame of those per\nsons who do not care enough about con\nditions here that can be corrected by vot\ning in a dependable slate of candidates—\nif developments show that their names are\nnot even on the registration books.\nToo much depends upon the future\nwelfare of the city of Key West to side\ntrack this civic duty.\nThe Citizen hopes to hear that 4,500\nnames are on the books come election day.\nHearing of that fact—the knowledge of a\n“new day” to come will be in our con\nsciousness.\nOURCHANGING BODIES\nIf you weigh yourself today, and then\nweigh yourself three weeks from now,\nyour weight will probably show little\nchange. But, according to Dr. Adolph of\nthe University of Rochester, at least 93 per\ncent of the real substance of your body\nwill have been changed in the meantime.\nFor, he asserts, the water content of a\nhuman body changes every 21 days, on an\naverage, and the body is 93 per cent water.\nHe also figures that the nitrogen of the\nbody, which is the chief element in the\nchemical composition of muscle, is renewed\nevery 290 days, while the iron component\nis changed in a slightly longer period.\nIt used to be thought that the actual\nsubstance of one’s body was completely\nchanged about every seven years, but Dr.\nAdolph’s researches indicate that the time\nbf renewal is much less than that.\nSo, when you look in your mirror you\nmay see what appears to be the same ob\nject you saw there a year or two before.\nBut the real substance will be almost en\ntirely different, and the change will gen\nerally be for the worse rather than for\nthe better.\n“PUBLIC ENEMIES”\nSome time ago we thought a criminal\nhad gained some kind of eminence by be\ning included among those on the list of\n“public enemies” on file in the office of\nthe Department of Justice.\nIt seems that we were mistaken. The\nnumber of criminals now on the roll as\n“public enemies” totals 14,137. They\nhave been convicted 26,205 times for\ncrimes, including 761 kidnapings, 460\nhomicides, 5,391 robberies, 3,628 larcen\ncies, 2,733 burglaries, 706 forgeries, 132\nblackmailings, 1,001 auto thefts and 693\nembezzlements.\nTHE KEY WEST CITIZEN\'\nHURRAY!

She was conscious\nof feeling two things in nerself at\nonce: relief to see that Laura was\nsafe, a quick stab of iealousy.\nLaura’s face had been turned up\nto Locke’s, the way that she,\nCecily, had so often looked at him.\nWhatever Locke’s reaction, none\nof them could tell.\nLaura was nonplussed. She was\nstartled to see Donald there so un\nexpectedly. Cecily’s presence had\ndestroyed completely her joint\nplan with Locke to tell her another\nstory. Waves of flushes rose in her\ncheeks, giving her a look of blatant\nguilt.\n“Hello,* r \'she said. There was so\nlittle else to say.\n“Hello.” Cecily said.\n“Nice day for walking,” Locke\ncommented.\nThey might all have met casual\nly on Fifth Avenue. Cecily said,\n“Oh. Locke ... I ... I don’t believe\nyou know Mr. Hemingway.”\nThey bowed to each other.\nOh. if only I could call a taxi\nand get into it. Cecily thought.\nWhy doesn’t somebody say some\nthing! Whv did people have to\nlook guilty?\nLaura surprisingly, broke the\nsilence. “I was just coming in,”\nshe said. “It was such a beautiful\nmorning I couldn’t resist the im\npulse to take a long walk. I had\nno idea it was so late. Then . . .\nthen I ... I happened to turn my\nar.kle and . . . and Locke came\nalong and offered m his arm.”\n“Oh!

I thought\nthat we might walk out and pick\nyo’ uo at vour place ”\nwas thinking: Never\nrrund that you know hasn’t\nturned her ankle Pav no atten\ntion to the thought that Laura’s\ncott"*e was in another direction\n“Oh. thnrk vou.

After that ihe couldn’t\nat him.\nFunny how quickly a thought\ncan dart through your mind.

Apparently Locke\nknew all the natives. “We’ve got\na lady here who h s an injured\nankle. Do vou \'think you could\nbalance her on that plank that\nserves as your carriage?”\nDod reckoned he could.\nVerv tenderly, Donald giving\nno help, Locke assisted Laura to\na comparatively safe spot on the\nsingle plank between the rear\nwheels.\n“When you get home—and you\nmust go home directly—put that\nankle in water as hot as you can\nstand it and keep off it for the rest\nof the day. It’ll be all right tomor\nrow, I’m sure.”\nCecily, anxious to escape, said.\n"I had better go with Laura.”\nLaura said. “Oh. it isn’t neces\nsary. Cecily ”\nCecily couldn’t believe her ears\n“But 1...”\n“Locke’s right. I really ought to\nrest and I’ll be good as new to\nmorrow. You’d better get back to\nthe shop. Cecily.”\n“Since I’m leaving you in good\nhands. I’ll be getting back to\nwork," Locke said, as Laura drove\noff.

Y., 58 years ago.\nCarole Lombard, screen star,\n“I beg your pardon,” Donale\nsaid.\nLaura called out, “Thank yoi\nfor the invitation, Donald. Pleast\nask me another time.”\nCecily hadn’t seen the expres\nsion on Donald’s face but she dit\nsee desolation on Laura’s be\nfore her cart rounded a comer in\nthe road.\nDonald and Cecily, speechlesa\nfor the first few yards, retraced\ntheir steps. Then Cecily said some\nthing bright about the Yacht Club\ndance, getting, she noted, no re\nsponse. Somehow she managed tc\nkeep conversation going until\nDonald escorted her to her door,\nwithout once wondering what his\nguest at the inn would think of\nthe delay. It was then nearly two\no’clock. An odd hour for lunch in\nVickersport.\nBut would you tell her, please,\nif there was anything that wasn’t\nodd that day? You meet your best\nfriend on the road with the man\nshe knows you are in love with.\nFate, that wily playwright, takes\nthe moment when you start look\ning for her to turn up that old cot\ntonball of a bank president that\nshe’s foolish enough to fall in love\nwith.\nYou know perfectly well that\nLaura and Lodke are not interest\ned in each other that way. Or do\nyou? Anyway, you know that\nLaura is incapable of doing any\nthing wrong or unfair.\nBut why did Laura have to lie\nabout it? And why did Donald\nhave to hear that odious child say\nthat Laura had not been home all\nnight?\nWhile you’re asking yourself\nquestions, Miss Stuart, why did\nLaura treat you that way? Why\ndid she say she didd’t need to have\nyou go home with her? Anyone\nwith half an eye could see that\nthere was nothing wrong with her\nankle.\nWhat had Locke told Laura?\nThat man could get away with\nanything! At this very minute\nCecily was prepared to think that\nhe’d murder Laura in her bed to\nget away her wrist-watch with\nthe ten diamond chips.\nAlso, at that moment, Cecily\nwould like to have strangled some\none to get rid of the frustrations\nthat choked her.\nTlease Come\'\nIT SEEMED to her that day that\n■ every person who came into the\nshop came in merely to find some\none to talk to. She discussed ton\nsilectomies with one woman, the\nloss of nuances in translations with\nanother She picked out love sto\nries for a fierce-browed old lady,\ndid up a gift package for an in\nvalid. hunted down a copy of\nJames Elroy Flecker for someone\nelse. She exchanged books in the\n.circulating department. Stamp.\nWrite the date on ♦\' card. Six\ncents. Fifteen cehts. The little\nstrong-box was filled that day, but\nit gave her no satisfaction.\nShe got out her cost sheets and\ncalculated the cost of taking her\nnew stock back to New York. She\ntried to wrestle with the problems\nattendant on opening a shop in\nNew York But figures flew out of\nher mind. She couldn’t make her\nself write neat columns.\nCecily was fed ud with books.\nWith people. With Cecily Stuart.\nAt five o’clock she drew the\nVenetian blinds in the window,\nbanked the fire in the hearth and\nput up the fire-screen. She tidied\nthe effects of the day’s business,\nput away her cards and put on her\ncoat.\nShe was angrily tucking her\nhair under her blue felt when the\nknocker on the door thudded\nheavily.\n“No more customers,” she said\nunder her breath. “I’m tired of\nwaiting on people,”\nThe knoc\'.ing was insistent.\nShe sighed and opened the door.\nThere was a little girl there. “I\ngotta note,” she said, holding it out\nin her grimy hand.\nCecily tore open the envelope.\n“Please come out, Cecily." Laura\nhad written. “I want to talk to\nvou.” There was nothing more but\nLaura’s name.\nCecily felt as though a weight\nhad been lifted from her heart. It\nwas bad enough lose Locked it\nwas a tragedy to lose her friend.\nCecily said, patiently, “I’m try\ning to understand, Laura, if only\nyou’d tell me somethingf u\nLaura’s face, under her brave\nrouge, was white. Her head\nthrobbed with pain and she\ncouldn’t tell that to Cecil*. The\npain kept coming between her and\nwhat she was trying to say to the\nother girl. She wished that she\ncculd take a sedative and shut out\nall the imps that possessed her\nmind. Shut out the memory of\nDonald’s cold face.\nShe had watched it soften dur\ning those weeks that she’d known\nhim. watched the light in his eyes\ngrow warm, and in that warmth\nshe had blossomed.\n“Surely there is a simple ex\nplanation,” Cecily persisted.\nTm trying to give you one. I’ve\nsaid all there is to say.” Laura\nmade a turn about her living-room\nand stared out the window mo\nrosely “I did go to Locke’s place,\nor I started to ... that is. as I told\nyou on the telephone. I did talk to\nhim, and I feel the same way I did\nwhen I talked to you in the after\nnoon.
