For some reason, best known to\nhimself, ho assumed tho responsibility of organizing a republican\nparty in Honolulu, withcut tho advice, assistance or wishes of tho\nreal leaders of that party. In self defense, the reputable element\nof that party had to take tho olfonsive to head oiT murrayism. Pan\ndora\'s box thus being opened, all these subsequent ills have fol\nlowed. For the present wo want no more Murrayism, no uioro re\npublicanism and no more democracy in our local affairs. Wh..t we\nlo want is a solid and harmonious union of tho intelligent vol .3 of\nIslands, and Avhen we have set our own houso in order, it will be\ntime enough to divide into parties and try to settle the affairs of\nthe nation.\n9 9 9\nAre the independents to be blamed so much as they are to bo\npitiod for having stood together in support of what to them was a\n\'principle? lust look at it from their standpoint. For seven year.\nthey have been denied the right, of voting, and can it be wondered\nthat they would endeavor to punish those whom they hold respon\nsible? To them, the men for whom they voted, with the possible\nexception of Wilcox, cut no figure. They were voting for a prin\nciple, and that is simply what tho victory of 1900 will mean to\nthei:K Their candidates for the legislature were siniphf just so\n?iauy pawns with which they played their political game.\ne O\nWailuku is having a delightful \'spall" of weather, even for\nPi3\nVV uluku.\nTho air is cool and criso\nnnt beyond description, and the\n.sleeps like an infaii.

Mn was\nfifth in a family of nine children whose\nparents were hardworking people\nof small means. Collis was big and\nstrong uh a boy and his splendid\nphysljuo e.ii\'riivl h\'r.n successfully\nthrough life. At school he was a\nleader and in wrestling bouts h was\nthe champion of all the countryside.\nOut of Rcliixil he had to work at\nodd jobs to help support the family.\nHis Ih\'st dollar was earned for piling\nwood for a neighbor. At 14 he hit\nschool .oid his father gave him his\n\'\'time," with the understanding that\nhe should support himself. Ho found\neinploymeut on a farm at $7 per\nin n th and bvird. At the end of\ntap year lie hud s.ive.l thucatirc\nvuiouut of his Wi-.es.\nThe next year ho entered a general\ncountry store, where he studied the\npeople who traded there und acqulr-\nd business shrewdness whieh lie\nadded to his natual-born thrift.\nYoung Huntington came to New\nYork in 1S;17, a boy of sixteen, but\na man in ontorprise. fie had !T."\nin his pocket and lots of good advice\nin his head. HU mother\'s pari tun\nwords made a deep impression on\nhail, and he avoided the -nares of\nthe town and was a total abstainer\nfrom liquors.\nHuntington\'s emploj-er in Harwin-\nton, Ebenezer Noble, who kept the\ngeneral store, had given him a btter\nof introduction to the New York\nmerchants with wh:.m he traded\nand offered to stand sponsor for the.\nyoung man m the way of credit.\nWith faith in himself Huntington\nbourht a lot of watch findinjrs and\ntraveled to the South. In this wav\nho made his first $1,000.\nFrom this point the young man\nrapidly pushed his way in various\nbusiness ventures, keeping store at\nOneonta. N. Y., getting married\nard joining the gold rush to California\nin \'4!. Ho didn\'t bother about digg\ning gold, however. His forte was\nm trade and ho established himself\nin the hardware business at Sacra\nmento. In seven years ho accumu\nlated a good-sized fortune.\nThen followed tho great coup of\nHuntington\'s life, tho building of the\nCentral Pacific Railroad, in which\nho and his associate\'s his partner.\ntho Crockcrs and Leland Stanford\nafter miny years interested the\nUnited States government in build\nnig. llie plan was perfected m the\nstore of Huntington & Hopkins, and\nthe men interested united in paying\nthe expences of a preliminary survey\nacross the mountains.\nIn 18!il these men organized the\nCentral Pacific Railroad Company.\nStanford was made president \' and\nHuntington vice-nrcsidoit.\nTho latter went to Washington\navd put through Congress in ISlii\nthe bnl authoring the construction\nof tho road and contributing bonds\nto help in tho enterprise. Tho day\nthe bill was signed he telegraphed\nto hi i partners:\n"The bill has passed and wo have\ndrawn tho elephant."\nThe act passed by Congress gave\nto the Central Pacific Railroad Com\npany a franchise to construct a rail\nroad and telegraph lino through\nCalifornia from west to cast, having\ntho right to continue eastward till\nit met the Union Pacilic.\nIn aid of the project the govern\nment agreed to givo every alternate\nsection of public land to tlm number\nof five alternate sections per milr\non each side of tho road, tho Secre\ntary of the Treasury to issue to the\ncompany bonds of tho United States\npayable thirty yars after date.\nbearing (i per cent, interest. .\nMr. Huntington came to New York\nand sold $1,500,000 of his bonds ia\ncash after pledging tho credit of\nhimself and his firm for their pay\nmont.\nThe construction was begun and\npushed, though Huntington and Hop\nkins mortgaged themselves to get\nthe funds. At last, in May, 1800, in\nUtah, was driven in tho last spika\nwhich connected the Atlantic ami\ntho Pacilic by rail.\nThe rest of tte story is one of stock\nVatering and freeze-out which has\nbeen common ia the history of A inert\ncan railroads.

It is a combina\ntion of tho telephone and phono\ngraph and makes its record on a\nsteel ribbon instead of a cylinder of\nwax. Tho steel ribbon moves along\nin front of an electromagnet \'which\nis energized by a current coming\nfrom the telephone transmitter cir\ncuit. The vibrations of the diaphragm\naffect the magnetization of the elect-\n\'oinugnet, and in turn the various\nparts of the steel ribbon are magne\ntized in various degnes as the ribbon\nmoves by. Strange to say, the un\nequal magnetization of the ribbon\nbeec-rncs practie.illy permanent.\nIt then only remains to run the\niblxm again through the same ap\nparatus, immediately or at a future\ntime, and the various purls acting\non tho electromagnet with varying\nintensity the pulsations are trans\nmilted to the diaphragm and the\npooch is reproduced. The opera\ntions are electrical instead of mechan\nical as in all former types of talking\nmachines, and the iiualitv of the\nvoice is preserved, instead of being\nmerely parodied. When it is desired\nto erase the ines-age from tho steel\niblxm it is only necessary to pet;\nthe ribbon between tho poles of an\nelectromagnet, whereupon the ine\nqualities in magnetization are at\nonce removed.\nThe instrument is called a telcgra-\npnone. One adaptaion in use in an\noflice in Copenhagen is an apparatus\nwhich, m ihe absence of- the pro\nprietor, automatically informs in\nquirers over tho telephone wire that\nno one is in and asks the inquire!\nhis business.

Dr.\nMaxwell, ns well as the editor of the\n"Monthly," wrote an article about\nthings ofwhieh neither of them knew\nthe facts. Tf (he "Monthly"- was\nsolely guided by tho report of Dr.\nMaxwell, it may bo excused for the\nerror. AcAordin? to Dr. I.iYwnir\nreport, Molokai h :is no streams flow\nhig to its Kona side, and he argues\ntherefrom that no waier could be\nfound by boring on the Kon.i nide of\nMolokai.\nThe editor showed this article to E.\nDunn and George Trimble, two old\nhunters of Molokai, who havo tramp\ned over every foot of the Kona moun\ntains. These hunters pointed out\nthe misstatements in tho article and\nassured the editor tlin t Dr. Maxwell\nhad never been, on the Kona sido of\nthe Kamalo mountains of Molokai,\nbut had probably made his observa\ntion! from the deck of a passing\nstoamor,\nIt is a well known fact to all old\nresidents of Molokai that there are a\nlarge number of streams which flow\ninto the .sea on the Kona side of Mo\nlokai at most times of the year. True,\nnot many How continiously to the sea,\nbut they flow to within a short dis\ntance of it. Tho principal of these\nis tho Great Kawehi r.nUli ui,i,.i.\nflows continiously to withiu half a mile\nof the sea.\nThat there arc many others, can\nbe substantiated by observation and\nby the statements of reputable men\nwho live- hero and know about these\nthings.\nThere is a great future for Molo-\nuai, as there is no better caue land\non the Islands, but to get a supply of\nwater by boring one must come the\ngreat Kawela Gulch and eastward.\nKamaaixa.\nDeath oS Hon.
