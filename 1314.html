NO. 19.\nLOUISVILLE, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1914.\nPRICE FIVE CENTS.\nn\nHELP POOR.\nCharitable Organization to Now\nUegin Hard Work of the\nYear.\nYincentlans Freely and Gener\nously Aid Sufferers of All\nReligion.\nStand Without a Peer Among\nthe Societies Composed of\nLaymen.\nTHEIR 1 WORK DONE QUIETLY\nThe winter season brings Its obli-\nKutlona. The various charitable or\nganizations must now begin the real\nhard work of the year. First among\nthem, as in all good things, Is the\nold Mother Church. Sometimes\ncomplaint Is made that the Catnoiic\nchurch is not active in work fo the\npoor. The explanation, says our\nneighbor, the Indiana uatnouc, may\nbe found in the fact that the church\ndoes not hare a publicity bureau.\nThe foundling asylums, orphanages,\nhomes of the Good Shepherd, hos\npitals and homes for the aged, con\nducted by Catholic sisterhoods, are\ndoing more real charity than all the\nother philanthropic institutions In\nthe country. Their work is done so\nouletly that you seldom hear of it.\nIf statistics of the charity they\nare doing were published it would\nsurprise those who are not familiar\nwith Catholic -charity and might\nopen the eyes of some of the enemies\nof the church.\nWinter will mean extra work for\nall these charities. It will be par\nticularly hard on the St. Vincent de\nPaul Society. This society has no\nendowment from which to draw\nfunds. It must depend on the free\nwill offerings of the people and it\nis worthy of every assistance. There\nare many organizations in this\ncountry founded for the purpose of\nrelieving the poor, some under the\nauspices of the various churches and\nsome of non-sectarian character.\nThe St. Vincent de Paul Society out\nranks them all. It has virtues that\nnone holds in common with It.\nv While the first visible work of the\nsociety is to visit the poor and re\nlieve their sufferings, the Vln\ncentlana are profoundly convinced\nthat Christian eharity baa - a- wider\nand broader field than temporal\nrelief. As men of deep religious con\nvictions, they view the present life\non the background of the super\nnatural. \' To the relief of the suf\nferings of the fleBh they add the\nconsolations of the spirit. They\nknow that material assistance is only\nhalf the work of charity. Their ob\nject is to permanently improve the\nconditions of the poor. To accom\nplish this they impart that interior\npeace and consolation which is the\nproduct of religious faith.\nThe society never draws the de\nnominational line. It is not open to\nthe slightest suspicion of being a\nproselytizing organization. It freely\nand generously . helps the poor of\nall religions or of no religion. Tet\nthere are many distinctly splrttual\nworks that it can do only with those\nof its own faith. Through the St\nVincent de Paul Society visitor many\na Catholic child is sent to the parish\nschool. Many families are brought\nback to the practice of their relig\nion. By this Intimate knowledge of\nconditions as well as the good will\nand gratitude which follows kind\nness in time of poverty or sickness,\nhe can frequently accomplish results\nwhich even the pastor could not\nhope for under other conditions.\nFar above all the virtues of the\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society is the\n. motive that prompts the members in\ntheir work. It is not a philan\nthropic society. It Is not a species\nof .altruism or humanitarian\' effort.\nIt Is a society based on a real con\nception of the charity of Christ. The\nmotive of the work is supernatural.\nTo the Vincentian this is not a\nsentiment but a living reality. He Is\nnever allowed to forget It, is never\nunconscious of it. While his im\nportant object is to help the poor it\nis done solely for the honor and\nglory of God. In the poor be sees\nChrist. It is for Christ he works\nand to Christ he ministers. He ex\npects no word of praise from bis\nfellowmen. He wants no compensa\ntion in this world. When ingrati\ntude or failure is the only response\nto his efforts he is not worried. He\nremembers that it was work for God\nand he is willing to await God\'s\nverdict.\nThis, is the character that Indi\nvidualizes the St. Vincent de Paul\nSociety. It Is an organization work\ning with natural instruments but\nwith a motive and an end that\ntranscends the natural order. It is\nlinking the human with the Divine.\nThat such wonders have been accoid\npllshed by It la not surprising when\none knows Us character. It Is cer\ntain no organization based on purely\nnatural motives, no matter how\nworthy or exalted, could accomplish\nwhat this society has accomplished\nin the eighty years of its existence.\nIt stands without peer among the\nsocieties composed of laymen. There\nis none either in the church or out\nof It that can so properly expect the\nsupport of the people. Its tneinbers\nand officers serve without salaries\nor perquisites of any kind. Every\ndollar contributed to the society Is\nexpended for the purposes for which\n\' It Is given.\nThe St. Vincent de Paul Society\nwll probably fee forced soon to ask\nfor aid. In Ihe name of the charity\nof Christ we speak for a generous\nresponse.\nLITERARY TREAT ASSt\'RED,\nDr. J. W. Fowler, besides being\nSuperintendent of the City Hos\npital, Is counted one of the best all\naround ffterary men in Louisville.\nAt one time he was associate .editor\nof the Midland Review and at pres\nent is a regular contributor to lead\ning medical Journals.

" 8. J. McEllIott gave quite\nan Interesting talk on his recent trip\nthrough the automobile plants of\nDetroit and stated our largest rail-,\nroad shops here could be nlaced in\none corner of the big pfants there,\nand also detailed how the different\npants were constructed and the care\nused making them uniform. Before\nthe close of the meeting prayers\nwere offered.. lor .lbaXfiDQaaoi ihe\nsoul of Michael Ruhan, a member,\nwho died Monday morning.\nBIG Y. M. I. DAY.\nTomorrow will be a big day for\nMackln, Trinity and Unity Councils\nand the Y. M. I. of the Falls Cities.\nThe three councils will conduct a\njoint initiation at Trinity Hall, Bax\nter and Morton avenue, beginning at\n2 o\'clock, when a class of 100 young\nmen will be received into this most\nexcellent Catholic organization. The\njoint degree team will put on the\nwork, at the conclusion of which\nchartered cars will convey the mem\nbers and candidates to the Seelbach\nHotel, where an elaborate banquet\nwill be served at 7 o\'clock, with\nJames B. Kelly presiding as toast\nmaster. Rev. Patrick Monaghan\nwill offer the invocation and re\nsponses to toasts will be made by\nMayor John H. Buschemeyer, Rev.\nFather Francis Felten, Eugene\nCooney, Gustave Weineman and At\ntorney A. J. Blzot. This initiation\nhas been looked forward to with\nmuch interest and will doubtless at\ntract one of the largest Y. M. I. gath\nerings held in Louisville.\nMARYKXOLL\'S FIRST APOSTLE.\nThe first priest from the new\nAmerican Seminary for Foreign\nMissions was ordained on Tuesday,\nNovember 10. The ceremony took\nplace at the Cathedral In New York\nand Cardinal Farley officiated. The\nnewly ordained, who holds the en\nviable distinction of being the first\nof what all Catholics hope will be\na long and memorable list of Ameri\ncan apostles from Maryknoll, is the\nRev. Daniel Leo Mchane. Father\nMcShane is a native of Columbus,\nInd., and received his classical\ntraining in St. Joseph\'s College,\nRensselaer, In that State. He en\ntered St. Mary\'s Seminary In Balti\nmore five years ago as a subject of\nthe Bishop of Rockford, 111., and\nthree years later, when the American\nForeign Mission Seminary was\nopened, offered himself, with\nBishop Muldoon\'s generous endorse\nment, as one of Its pioneer students.\nThe ordination of this first young\nAmerican apostle was to have been\nvery quietly effected, but New York\nCatholics are keenly alive to the\nforeign mission idea, and the cere\nmony, which had been planned for\nthe Cardinal\'s residence-chapel, was\ncarried out in the great Cathedral.\nThe entire student body of the\nCathedral attended, with a large\nbody of the faithful, and among\nthose present In the sanctuary was\nthe well known Mill Hill mlssloner.\nRight Rev. Bishop Blerauans, of\nUganda, British East Africa, and the\nVery Rev. John J. Dunn,\nPRIESTS HOXOHED.\nBishop Charles E. McDonnell, of\nBrooklyn, last Saturday announced\nthe elevation of two priests to the\nrank of Monstgnor. They are the\nRev. Michael O. Flannery, rector of\nSt. Paul\'s church, and the Rev. John\nP. Hoffman, rector of St. Nicholas\'\nchurch. This makes five priests in\nBrooklyn who have been so honored.\nILLITERACY\nProven Heavy Handicap to Men\nand Women Despite Their\nAbility.\nLieut. Gov. Edward J. McDer\n\' mott Cammends New\nCampaign.\nPoints Out the Great Incentive\nFor Woman\'s Forward\nMovement.\nAPPEAL TO OUR SYMPATHY\nKentucky is now Inaugurating an\nearnest campaign against adult\nilliteracy, which has the full and\nmerited support of every class and\ncreed. The movement will be\nlaunched In Louisville next Tuesday\nevening In connection with which\nLieut. Gov. McDermott has written\nthe following:\nNo one can doubt that an Illiterate\nman or woman is at a great disad\nvantage In life and has not the full\npossible value to the city or State.\nTo remove such a handicap by our\nefforts is en act of charity and a\nduty we owe to our neighbor and to\nourselves. The want ol a primary\neducation makes the earning of a\nliving harder, makes life less agree\nable and satisfactory, and to some\nextent unfits a man for the proper\nperformance of his public duties in\nthis day. The illiterate man, not be\ning fully qualified as a voter or a\njuror, is a handicap to his better-\nqualified neighbor and to the com\nmunity. An ignorant man in one\ncounty may nullify the vote of the\nmost intelligent man in his own\ncounty or in some other county, and\nby reason of his limitations may be\npartly responsible for an unjust ver\ndict in court. Even In war an edu\ncated man has more value than an\nilliterate. Occasional exceptions do\nnot change the rule, and while we\nadmit that some enthusiasts expect\ntoo much. of mere schooling, It is\nnevertheless too clear for argument\nthat illiteracy is a disadvantage that\nwe must strive by all reasonable\nmeans to remove.\nThe census of 1910 showed that\nin the United States there were five\nand a half millions of people who\ncould not read or write. Of these\n55 jier cent. were, whites, 28 percent.\nof them being native born and 30\nper cent, being foreign born. About\n40 per cent, of the total number\nwere negroes and 2 per cent, were\nIndians, Chinese, etc. Of those liv\ning in villages, towns and cities, less\nthan 1 per cent, were whites, and\nmore than 174 per cent, were\nnegroes. Four out of five of the\nilliterates were over twenty years\nold. Of the white voters 8.4 per\ncent, were illiterate; about half of\nthe number were native born. Of\nthe negro voters, 33.7 per cent, were\nilliterate. In Kentucky there were\n87,516 illiterate men, of whom\n60,147 were white natives; 1,382\nwere foreign born whites and 25,958\nnegroes. In Louisville 5.9 per cent,\nof the voters were illiterate, 1.4 be\ning native whites, less than 1 per\ncent being foreign born, and 20.3\nper cent, being negroes.\nThe generous efforts of the people\nof Kentucky in late years have\ngreatly reduced the number of illit\nerate children, but there are still\nmany illiterate adults who had not\nthe advantage of education in child\nhood or youth, and- who can still be\ntaught the elementary branches.\nThat haa been well proven by the\nsuccessful work of Mrs. Cora Wilson\nStewart In Rowan county, and by\nteachers elsewhere. In fact, it Is as\ntonishing to see bow quickly men and\nwomen in middle age, or even In old\nage, have learned to read and write\nand to learn simple arithmetic and\nto acquire the rudiments in other\nessential elements of knowledge. The\nzeal with which many old men and\nwomen have studied in the night\nschools in the villages and in the\ncountry, and the speed with which\nthey have advanced, must surprise\neverybody that has beard the story.\nSuch people make a strong appeal\nto our sympathy. To enable them to\nread and write and to make their\nown calculations in their business\naffairs Is to open their minds, to let\nin new light, to furnish a new source\nof Instruction and entertainment, to\nmake youth and middle age more\nsuccessful, and to make old age less\nmonotonous and more cheerful. Il\nliteracy makes men more exposed\nthan others to fraud, and hence\nmakes them more suspicious of oth\ners in their dealings. To be unable\nto write to our lovsd ones, or to be\nunable to read In private the letters\nof business or the tender words of\naffection that come from kindred and\nfriends is no slight Impediment In\nlife. If we can, by any reasonable\neffort, relieve our less fortunate\nneighbors of theae privations and\ndiscouragements, of theae stumbling\nblocks in their pathway, we should\ndo it with pleasure. The need of\neducation of the right kind is greater\nnow than ia former years. The\nstruggle for existence Is harder. Tbe\nneed of Innocent diversion, which\ngood books supply, la greater, be\ncause the temptations to dissipations\nalso are greater. So long as the\ntaxea on tbe thrifty are not made ex\ncessive, and so long as publio money\nis honestly and judiciously expended,\nwe can flud unalloyed satisfaction la\nadding to the power, usefulness and\ncontent of those who need and want\nthe blessing of knowledge and mental\ndevelopment.\nCOMING EVENTS.\'\nNovember 14-15 Euchre and\nlotto, Sts.

R. COMMISSIONER\nLieut. Gov. Edward J. McDermott\nIs the first to officially enter the\ncontest for the Democratic nomina\ntion for Governor, and in a card to\nthe public reviews his career with\nthe Democratic party and his .part\nin work for the good and welfare of\nthe State. There Is logic and reason\nIn every line of his opening state\nment, and the press throughout the\nState receive his announcement with\nmuch favor, many declaring them\nselves as supporters of his cause,\nbelieving that he is the logical man\nfor the nomination and one who\nwould attract many Independent\nvotes to the Democratic State ticket\nnext year. Lieut. Gov. McDermott\nsays in part: i\n"In 1911 many of the prominent\nmen of the party In\'\' Kentucky\npressed me hard to run for Lieu\ntenant Governor. Feeling that I\ncould not afford to neglect, for any\ntime, my practice at the bar, I re\nfused for six weeks to consent, but\nait last, less than six weeks before\nthe primary election, a very short\ntime to (make a canvass of the whole\nState against a strong, long, active\nand popular opponent, I reluctantly\nconsented to make the race because\nthe men urging me to-run said that,\nIn their opinion, my services would\nhelp the whole Democratic ticket and\nbe of some benefit to the State. To\nthe best of my ability I have served\nboth the party and the State, not\nonly as President of the Senate but\nalso as Governor whenever Gov. Mc-\nCreary has been absent from the\nState.\n"At the request of the National\nDemocratic Committee, in evefy\nPresidential campaign for fourteen\nyears I have made many speeches for\nthe ticket in -Kentucky and in many\nof the Northern and Eastern States.\nMany of our beBt citizens in every\nwalk of life and of every part ot the\nState have urged me to run, and I\nhave determined to do it. In\nnumerable times in past years I have\nbeen called upon by men of every\ncalling and every faith and every\nparty to help worthy causes with my\ntime, money and labor, and rarely\nhave I refused. My tongue and pen\nhave always been at the service of\nmy city, State and party.\n"In the election of 1911 Gov.\nMcCreary\'s majority over Judge\nO\'Rear was 31,335 by the official\ncount. Mine over Judge Bristow\nwas 30.644. The official vote for\nIhe Democrats elected on the State\nticket, as published in the newspa\npers at the time, was as follows\nMcDermott, 221,534; Crecelius,\n220,959; Garnebt, 221,260; Bos\nworth, 220,959; Rhea,- 220,660;\nNewman, 220,606; Hamlett,\n221,086; Greene, 220,843. It will\nthus be seen that the voters of Ken\ntucky were especially generous to\nme among so many able and popular\nmen. .\n"In 1915 tbe head of the Demo\ncratic ticket will meet a reunited\nRepublican party and our leader\nmust have the desire and the ability\nto defend the record ot the State\nfcimlnlstratlon and the National ad\nministration from any unjust attack.\nI believe it will be admitted that I\ncan and will do that task fairly well\nnow as I did in 1911. I believe the\npeople will elect me. Certainly they\ncan rely on my doing what I can for\nthe honor ot the party and the fur\nther advancement of our Common\nwealth. Although nearly all the\npledges of the platform of 1911 have\nbeen carried out, there is yet much\nto be done to satisfy the people of\nthe State. All my life has been a\npreparation for such a task and I\nshould be glad to have a chance to\nperform It."\nIt Is also rumored that Auditor\nBoBworth, Commissioner Newman\nand Judge John F. Hager will an\nnounce la the nest few days for tbe\nGovernorship now that Lieut. Gov.\nMcDermott has paved tbe way, and\nwith their entry the announcements\nfor the other State offices will fol\nlow in short order, and it goes with\nout saying that a great amount ot\nthe campaigning will be done right\nhere In Louisville, which Is now the\nbanner district of the Stats from a\nDemocratic standpoint. This cam\npaigning is sure to be done, too,\namong tbe boys in the trenches, the\nward and precinct workers, the\ncandidates not putting much faith In\nthe promises of the high and lofty\nDemocrats that frequent \'the Seel\nbach lobby and attempt to speak for\ntbe Democrats of Louisville, their\nsole stock In trade being a contribu\ntion to tbe campaign fund (for\nwhich they receive much advertis\ning), but as for mixing wrth the\ncommon herd of voters In a prknary\ncontest, there is nothing doing. An\nother favorite plan ot this class is\nto conduct a chain letter campaign\nfor some pet measure or project,\nthese being sent to public officials,\netc.. warning them of their duties or\nobligations, but at the same time\nkeeping the sender In the limelight\nof publicity. The prospective candi\ndates allying themselves with this\nclass of support are doomed to de\nteat, as the hotel lobby campaigners\nare sure to prove a veritable Slnbad\nof the sea for anyone to carry.\nFrom present Indications there\nwill be a three-cornered race for\nRailroad Commissioner In the Sec\nond district, which Includes the vote\nof Louisville and Jefferson county\nHon. George B. (Cack) Barrett, who\nhas already received many pledges\nof support; John E. Newman, ot\nBardstown, and "Billy" Klalr, the\npresent Commissioner, the latter not\nofficially entering the race, but is\nexpected to declare hlimselt In a few\ndays.\'\nIn the different Legislative dis\ntricts in this county there has been\nno official announcements, but all of\nthe present Representatives are ex\npected to be candidates for re-election\nwith the possible addition ot\nLogan Rock In the Forty-eighth, his\nname Doing mentioned frequently,\nwhile Senator Hlte Huffaker will\nprobably be without opposition for\nthe only Senatorial nomination to be\nmade In this section.\nThe announcement of the candi\ndates for the Circuit Judgeships are\nexpected before the holidays, while\nFrank Dugan Is the one bet for the\nnomination for Circuit Clerk, with\npopular "Bob" Kaltenbacher, for\nmerly of that office, being mentioned\nas a possible entry and "JoMiny"\nPage, the present chief deputy in\nthat office, also named as a starter.\nNOMINATE OFFICERS.\nLast Sunday afternoon the St. Jo\nseph Orphan Society held a largely\nattended and enthusiastic general\nmeeting in St. Boniface school hall,\nwhen the following were nominated\nfor central officers for the coming\nyear:\nPresident Joseph Schlldt and\nHerman Steinlage.\nVice President John Tobe and\nD. Lubbers.\nRecording Secretary F. A. Kopp\nand Dr. C. J. Glesler.\nFinancial Secretary Sebastian O.\nHubbuch and A. H. Huckenbeck.\nCorresponding Secretary NIc\nBosler and John Hubbuch.\nTreasurer J. ,B. Ratterman and\nGeorge Bohr.\nThe parish branches of the society\nwill nominate officers and delegates\nat meetings to be held tomorrow,\nand the general election will take\nplace on the third Sunday in Decem\nber. President Schild\'s annual re\nport will show that the asylum haa\nhad another very successful year.\nLAID TO REST.\nDeath claimed John Helnzman,\none of the best known and most\npopular members of the Louisville\npolice force, Tuesday morning at his\nhome, 419 West L street. Born In\nthis city" forty-nine"" years " agd,\' he\nmade life-time friends of all with\nwhom he came in contact. Twenty\nyears ago he was appointed to the\npolice force, and was made Station\nkeeper at Central Station by Mayor\nHead. Courteous, efficient and true,\nhe had been honored with several\noffices in the Louisville Police\nUnion and for the past two years had\nbeen its Treasurer. Surviving him\nare his mother, Mrs. Julia Helnz\nman; a brother,.

The Catholic\npress in the United States would be\nvirile enough and a sufficiently pow\nerful moulder of public opinion it\nthe number of subscribers were In\ncreased several-fold. As long as the\ngreat majority of Catholics are\napathetic on the question of Cath\nolic newspapers we are bound to\nhave periodic outbursts of Ignorant\nbigotry that could be met and dis\nsolved by a more militant and wide\nawake activity on. the part of\nCatholics themselves. . If half the\nwell-wishers of the Catholic press\nand the resolution makers would\nsee to it that their names are In\nscribed on the mailing lists of some\nCatholic newspaper, the church\nwould enjoy a new era of progress\nand the sphere of her influence\nwbnld be Immeasurably extended."\nIn his able address before the\nCatholic press convention Rev.\nJames Irwin said: "The Catholic\npapers of the United States are the\nseparate ships of the line sent out\non ithe open sea of our country to\ndefend and protect the honor and\ngood name of Mother Church, who\ns surrounded by hostile foes, and\nt the same time to enlighten the\nworld and others as to the peaceful\nand salutary office of the church in\nher mission \'to teach, sanctify and\naave all men.\' It la needless to say\nthat our editors are the \'captains\'\nof the line. \'Admiral\' would be a\nmore significant title."\nbut was permitted to have arms.\nHere at home the administration\npress used all Its facilities to create\na public opinion friendly to him.\nVilla could last in any American\ntown where his character and deeds\nwere known about as long al it\nwould take the leading citizens to\norganise a lynching party.

Father Lynch\nWhile Yet a Doy In\nIreland.\nCradle of Magnificent Oronp of\nnutldlngft \'Overlooking\nHaplds.\nFIRST ARCHBISHOP OF TORONTO\nBy James A. Rooney, LL. D.\nThe Seminary of Our Lady of\nAngels, now the ecclesiastical de\npartment of Niagara University, was\nfounded by the Rev. John Joseph\nLynch, C. M., afterward the first\nArchbishop of Toronto, Canada, with\na few boys In a house on Rest street,\nBuffalo, that had been used by Rev.\nJames M. Early as a home for orphan\nboys. He took possession of It on\nNovember 21, 1S56, and though the\nInfant seminary remained there less\nthan six months it was the cradle of\nthe magnificent group of buildings\nwhich now constitute Niagara Uni\nversity, on the , summit of Mont\nEagle Ridge, a commanding and\npicturesque site on the American\nbank of the Niagara, overlooking the\nwhirlpool rapids.\nThe founding of the semit ary in\nBuffalo and its subsequent removal\nto Its present location on May 1 of\nthe following year, realized a boy\nhood dream of the founder. The\nwriter, whose happiest recollection\nis that he was one of Father Lynch\'s\nearliest students, has sat entranced\nat his recital of that dream and its\nfruition. It was his privilege to be\none of a circle of "the old boys" at\nNiagara, seated around the founder\nIn the fall of 1859, when he lis\ntened to the story of that dream and\nits fulfillment, which was really the\nepitome of many years of missionary\nlabor. Here It is very much con\ndensed: "Once upon a time," and then ae\nlooked around at us over his glasses\nand smiled; "once upon a time\nthere was a little Irish boy in a town\ncalled Clones, In a diocese that bad\nbeen founded by St. Patrick himself\nIn Ireland, and this little boy was\nshown a picture of the great Falls\nof Niagara by a visitor from America\nand It made a wonderful Impression\non his mind. What a beautiful place\nhe thought In which to worship the\nCreator of that wonder; what an in\nspiring spot In which to offer up the\nholy sacrifice, and what a grand site\non which to build a college or sem\ninary to train priests for the great\nAmerican\'mlslon where \' they were\nthen so much needed. He dreamed\nof all this that sight. Well,- my\ndear children," said he, waving his\narms around so as to take In the\nentire landscape, "I was that little\nboy and here Is the dream come true.\nThough I am soon to leave you. all\nana this lovely spot, I will never\nforget you or It."\nThen he continued: "I was sent to\ncollege and seminary and was finally\noraainea a priest or the. Congrega\ntion of the Mission In Paris. I was\nglad to be sent as a missionary to\nAmerica, but Texas was my destina\ntion, and I found that was a lona-\ndistance from Nagara Falls. Later\nI was sent to St. Louis and then to\n8t. Mary\'s of the Barrens, iPerryvlllq,\nMo., where there was a house of ouf\norder. When Father Timon, now\nBisnop or Burraio, was appointed to\nthis diocese, which Included Niagara\nFalls, I asked" h km about It, if there\nwere any Catholics there and if they\nhad a church. He told me there\nwere a few Catholics but no church,\nand added: \'If you come up there\nwe will have a church and a sem\ninary, too!\' But I was not my own\nmaster and I was made Superior of\nSt. Mary\'s and then sent to Paris to\nattend the general assembly of the\ncongregation. There I told ouf\nSuperior General abbut Niagara and\nwhat .Bishop Timon had said, and I\nreceived permission to found a house\nof the order In his diocese; It was\ngetting warm, wasn\'t it,\n"Father Monagban came with me\nand we paid our first visit to the\nFalls. We had no money and land\nwas high, so we tried to open a\nhouse on a small farm near Buffalo.\nBut I took sick and we had to give;\nup that Idea. Then we found a\nhouse on the outskirts of Buffalo\nthat used to be an orphanage and\nwas then empty and we moved In on\nNovember 11, tne day after the feast\nof the Presentation, three years ago\n(185(). It wasn\'t suitable snd it\nwasn\'t Niagara and during the next\nChristmas holidays we made another\ntrip to Niagara with better luck this\ntime. We secured the Vedder farm\nof 100 acres at 175 an acre and not\nlong after we bargained for 200\nacres more, part of the Be Veaux\nproperty, and adjoining the other,\nand on which stood this house, then\na roadside Inn. We removed here on\nthe first day of Mary\'s month, and\nthat\'s the reason for the Barns,\n8emlnary of Our Lady of Angels, the\nname bestowed on us by Plus IX.\n"Of course w had little money,\nbut we received generous help from\nBishop Timon, his clergy and other\ngood friends, and some donations\ncame from most unexpected quar\nters, the largest gift being on of\n$10,000, which we call the \'miracul\nous $10,000.\' Tou know about that.\nI was sick In the hospital and Father\nMaglnnes (the Rev. John Maginnes,\nformerly of the Church of the Star\nof the Sea, Brooklyn) cams to see\nme and told tne he had been left the\nmoney to be applied to some good\npurpose and that Bishop Timon had\nsent him to me. That cured me at\nonce and It was a great God-send to\nthe seminary, coming Just when It\nwas most needed."\nThis Is the story of "Old Niagara"\ntold to his "boys" as s parting re\nmembrance by Father Lynch, and In\n(he circle that listened to the recital\nwere many whom he bad gathered\ninto his early fold.\nSOCIETY DIRECTORY.\n- At O.

As this fes\ntival will be for the benefit of the\nlarge and fine school Father Brey\nhas erected, it is hoped the festival\nwill be accorded a generous patron\nage. .\nADMITS DEFEAT.\nRoger C. Sullivan issued a state\nment Saturday In Chicago which\ncarried admission that his Republi\ncan opponent, Senator Sherman, had\nbeen re-elected Asserting that the\nsupport given him by friends fills his\nheart with gratitude, Mr, Sullivan\nsays:\n"No matter what the final result\nof the official canvass may be, it\nwill bring few regrets, no deep dis\nappointment and much personal sat\nisfaction. It la regrettable that we\nhave people so minded as to pen\nalize a man for the religion he got\nfrom bis mother, snd that we have\nmen willing to capitalize this baser\nnesa for the sake of getting office.\nThis appeal to religious prejudice,\npartcularly when given countenance\nby high personages in Democratle\nofficialdom, is still effective in some\nparts of Illinois."\nSecretary \' of State William J.\nBryan was in Chicago for two hours\nduring Saturday, headed for Wash\nington. He declined to comment\nupon the Illinois result. His quoted\ninterviews indicate that he is more\nor less satisfied with the national\nfigures. In the Sullivan statement\nthere is a noticeable absence of ref\nerence to the case of Bryan snd the\nopen activity of the Bryan Demo\ncratic leaders against Sullivan all\nthrough the string of counties\nnormally Democratic through thick\nand thin in past campaigns.\nTHE END.\nAndrew J. Ferg, the we.ll known\nlocal comedian, appeared this week\nwith his monologue act in a church\nentertainment on West Jefferson\nstreet, the entertainment to coiisUt\nof three night performances. Andy\nappeared th flrnt night the end.\nA v \'\nC\nTHE WAR\nWhat Will De Its Effect Upon\nthe Catholic Church In\nGermany?\nThat Country Contains Provin\nces the Moat Catholic In\nEurope.\nLouvaln University, Alma Mater\nof American Prelates and\nPriests.\nGERMAN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS\nWhat effect will the war In\nEurope have upon the Catholic\nchurch in the land of Emperor Will-\nlam Is a question frequently asked.\nIt Is not generally known that Ger\nmany contains some of the most\nCatholic provinces In Europe and Is\nmore than one-third Catholic. The\nRhine which flows through the\nCatholic regions is, If ever there\nwas one, a Catholic river. The Cath\nolic regions belong to Prussia,\nBavaria, Wurtemburg, Baden and\nHesse, and all of the Governments of\nthese provinces have a working un\nderstanding with the Holy 8ee,\ncalled a concordat. The main feat\nures of this understanding may be\nsummarized: Prussia and Bavaria\nhave their official representatives at\nthe Vatican, though the empire is\nnot formally represented. The Holy\nSee is represented in the German\nEmpire by the Nuncio to Bavaria,\nwho does duty for all Germany.\nModern Catholicity of Germany\nowes Its strength to the training and\nexperience it underwent during the\npersecution known as the "culture\ncampaign" (Kultuikampf ), in the\ncourse of which It found such really\ngreat leaders as Ketteler and Wind\nhorst, who were the founders of the\nCenter party of our own times. This\nsplendidly unified body of politicians\nco-operates with the five Arch\nbishops and twenty Bishops, three\nApostolic Vicars and two Prelects\nIn all. thirty units of the higher\njurisdiction. The Bishops are elected\nby the Cathedral Chapter, except in\nuavaria, wnere tney are chosen by\nagreement between the Government\nand Rome.\nGerman dioceses are gigantic, and\nGermany and Austria are unique in\nthis matter. Paris is the largest\ndiocese in the world, and must pos\nsess near four millions at this time.\nThe second, however, Is the diocese\nof Breslau (which includes Berlin),\nwith nearly three million Catholic\nsouls; Cologne has also nearly three\nmillions; the dioceses of Muenster,\nMunich and Freiburg contain about\none million Catholics each.\nThe labor organization of Catholic\nGermany may be divided into two\ngroups, those of the Berlin school\nand those of the Cologne school. In\nthe Berlin group Catholics are or\nganized In purely Catholic associa\ntions; in that of Cologne the eccle\nsiastical authorities are not recog\nnized as controlling forces. Un\nfortunately these two groups have\nnot always worked well together,\nalthough since the intervention of\nthe Pope in 1912 harmonious work\ning between the bodies has come to\nbe the order of the day. In no\ncountry In the world is so much\ndone for the cultivation of the spir.\nItual life of the work-a-day laborers,\nand the practice of "special retreats"\nfor the Catholic body has been the\nmain factor In producing this result.\nThat there Is no lack of religious In\nfluence lor the furtherance of such\nwork may be gauged from the fact\n(hat there are some 3,300 religious\nhouses of various kind and 33,000\nreligious. The orders are. however.\nsubject to somewhat restrictive\nsupervision by nearly all the Gov\nernments In the States. In Wurtem\nburg and Baden only female Insti\ntutes are allowed, in Saxony and the\nsmaller States only nursing Sister\nhoods.\nLouvaln , University, the alma\nmater of so many American prelates\nand priests, was founded by Pope\nMartin V. and Duke John of\nBrabant In 1423. Students flocked\nthere from all over the world. In\nthe sixteenth century It had 4,000\nstudents and forty-three colleges.\nUntil the German invasion many of\nthese old buildings were still stand\ning. It was given up by the Govern\nment In 1834, and since that time\nhas been conducted by Catholics.\nLast year It had an enrollment of\nupward of 1.000 students. The\nbuilding in which It is now con\nducted was remolded from an old\nwarehouse of the Clothmakers Guild\nin 13 IT. Upper stories were added\nin 1680. The arches and pillars on\nthe ground floor, the entrance from\nthe Rue des Cordes, still bore a\nwealth of carvings, sculptures and\nbas reliefs of the old masters. The\nlibrary occupied a large room with\nfine wood panels, carved in intricate\ndesigns. It held 160,000 volumes\nand thousands of manuscripts, val\nuable beyond price. In the center\nof the room stood colossal group\nrepreesntlng a scene from the flood\nsculptured by Geerts in 1839.\nAround the room and through the\nmain entrance corridor hung por\ntraits of the professors since the\nfounding of the Institution and\nbusts of learned scholars who hsd\nstudied there.\nMARAXVILLE WKDK.\nWelter J.
