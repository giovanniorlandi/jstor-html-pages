The historic\nreport "with teeth" of the industrial\nrelations commission is going to be\nmade to BITE!\nA committee of famous American\nsociological students and labor lead\ners has just been formed with the\npurpose of hammering out into the\nform of actual legislation and mate\nrial social accomplishment tbe vast\nmass of recommendations and sta\ntistics accumulated by the commis-Eio\nThousands of citizens in every\ntown in the country have felt that\nthe industrial relations report would\ngo down in history as a true magna\ncharta of the toilers of the nation, if\nonly its findings could be enforced, if\nonly those celebrated sharp-toothed\njaws could be made to snap shut\nupon the injustices and abuses from\nwhich, the report shows, American\nlabor suffers. (\nThrough this new agency, called\nthe "industrial relations committea,"\n. . , M lg mi rgTSfigBTrsrrTi jjjyH', 'xr.y:\nevery citizen will now have the\nchance of really helping in the en\nforcement of the findings.\nEven if congress pigeonholes the\nreport its findings will be kept con\nstantly before the nation; a people\'s\nlobby will be persistently at work to\nenact legislation corrective of indus\ntrial abusas.\nFrank P. Walsh is to be chairman\nof the new commission, and among\nother leading members are: Fred\nerick C. Howe, United States com\nmissioner of immigration; Amos Pin\nchot, progressive New York iawyer;\nBishop C. D. Williams of Detroit;\nAustin Garretson, John B. Lennon\nand James O\'Connell, the three lahor\nmembers of the former commission\non industrial relations; John P.\nWhite, president of the United Mine\nWorkers of America; John Fitzpat\nrick, president of the Chicago Feder\nation of Labor; Agnes Nestor, a Chi\ncago woman, one of the most active\nworkers in the trade union move\nment. "When congress meets in Decem\nber," said Basil M. Manly, one of the\nactive workers in formation of this\nnew agency for industrial reform,\n"the report of the industrial relations\ncommission will be laid before it and\nthe people of the nation will be offi\ncially informed for the first time that\nvast numbers of our workers receive\ntoo low a wage to maintain decent\nliving conditions; that the employer\nin unorganized industries is political\nly and socially an almost untram\nmeled dictator; and that only by or\nganization among themselves can the\nwage earners rescue themselves from\ntheir position of subserviency.\n"But while our new committee be\nlieves that any genuine, lasting im\nprovement must be achieved through\nthe collective action of the workers\nthemselves, we maintain that every\ngood citizen should aid in removing\ngovernmental obstacles to the organ\nization of wasre earners, and should\nlend his support to the trade union in 1\nany struggle where the existence of\nthe un\'on is at stake.\n"For while we admit there are\nsometimes mistaken policies and in\ncompetent leaders in unionism, we\nbelieve they are fostered by the situ\nation which makes the union fight\ndesperately for its very existence,\nand they tend to disappear when the\nunion is strong and recognized and\nable to perform its legitimate, useful\nwork of collective bargaining.\n"Our work in brief and for its ac\ncomplishment we hope for the co\noperation of all progressive citizens\nwill be to insist that in every struggle\nof labor for a just share in the profits\nand control of industry, the side of\nlabor be fairly reported in the press;\nthat the police and courts act with\nabsolute impartiality, and that the\nuse of private gunmen be prohibited.\n"And our aim will be to break\ndown the feudalistic power of the\ncorporations which control certain\nindustrial communities and to pro\ntect the rights of those workers who\ncarry the message of organization to\nthe tyrannizprf laborers in such com\nmunities \'\nSIX BITES\nAt the Throat of Privilege\nThis is what Frank P.

You are\ngiving him two votes in the Auto\nmatic phone situation. He now not\nonly represents the city, but also the\ncompany. Look at his record in the\nlegislature.

It was the most out\nrageous assault ever attempted on\nth.e city\'s attempt to make an inquiry\ninto the school funds. It was nothing\nmore than an attack on the Teachers\nFederation. I flatly charge that Sen\nator Ettleson\'s record disqualifies him\nto serve as corporation counsel."\nAid DePriest and Bergen defended\nEttleson.

Ninety per cent of the\npeople of this city will no \'longer have\nconfidence in the office of corpora\ntion counsel."\n"Ettleson is not on the square and\nhis appointment is a disgraceful hap\npening," said Aid.

Prosecuted the boy who\nthrew a ball and accidentally broke\nhis window.

He appointed\nSeptember 19 for "Make-It-Up Day."\nAll quarrels was to be settled on that\nday, he announced, and he\'d settle\nthem. He began by giving a dollar\nto .the boy that had broken his win\ndow, which was going some for Hi.\n"Nobody could believe \'it as first,\nand after the news spread the crowds\nused to come outside Hi\'s windows\nand holler at him to show himself.\nHe did, and he made a little speech.\nTold them he\'d got religion and he\nmeant to make Mosstown a hive of\nharmony. Those were his words, sir.\n"Well, Mosstown, like) most small\nplaces, had its own troubles. There\nwas Henson, the grocer, hated Bull,\nthe butcher, like mad.

They\'d\nfallen out over whether the solitaire\nhe\'d given her had a crack in it or\nnot Miss Jane said it had, and Joe\nsaid it was the edge of one of the\ncarats. In the end she sent him away\nand had the ring enlarged and wore it\non her thumb to show that was\nHow Hi Managed It I Don\'t Know.\nwhere she\'d have had him if she\'d\nmarried him.\n"Then there was Miss Rose Rob\nertson, the pride of the Second\nchurch. There hadn\'t been trouble\nthere in twenty years that Miss Rose\nhadn\'t had her finger in it. She\'d\nsued one pastor for breach of prom\nise, and had two dismissed, and was\nat daggers with Rev.

To\nthe man who seeks the truth and\nlooks at facts as they are is shown\nthe fallacy of certain arguments and\ntheories formerly brought up and\nstill prominently -brought to the\nfront One of them is that prepared\nness for war is a guaranty of peace.\nDid the thorough preparedness of\nGermany preserve her peace? Was\nshe not one of the first to to draw the\nsword? Would there have been peace\nhad each nation now engaged in this\ntitanic struggle twice the army and\nnavy they had at the beginning of the\nwar? Manifestly no! There is a\nwell-founded feeling that thorough\npreparedness itself is one of the\ncauses that brought on the war.\nSome say that foreigners look\nupon our army and navy as a joke.\nWhat is theirs now but a tragedy? It\nlooks to me like the joke is on them.\nOne thing is certain, and the mil\nlions in the trenches and dead-strewn\nbattlefields of Europe will testify to\nit, and that is that preparedness for\nwar is no guaranty of peace. Nei\nther is unpreparedness an induce\nment to war.\nTo secure peace and prosperity we\nmust abolish the institutions that\ncause war and economic discontent\nand restlessness of the masses of the\npeople. One of them is that of mili\ntarism. Another is the institution of pri\nvate monopoly of natural resources,\nwhich has already given 60 per cent\nof the wealth of our country to 2 per\ncent of the peoplpe and makes the\ndisinherited masses of England feel\nthat it is not worth while to fight for\ntheir boarding houses.\nAnother is the institution of tar\niffs. One of the main objects qf the\nfighting nations of the earth today\nis to extend their trade, to get free\nseaports for their commerce. Could\nthey not get them by absolute free\ntrade, by each nation abolishing their\ntariff walls and without having to go\nto war about it?\nWhy should there be boundaries\nand restrictions to trade? One of\nthe greatest advantages of these\nUnited States is that we have be\ntween them absolute free trade. The\ncitizens of New York can trade free\nly with the citizens of San Francisco,\nacross 3,000 miles of land. Should\n2,000 miles of water make any dif\nference? What effect upon commerce would\nthere be if we had a tariff wall around\neach state in the union like they\nhave around each country in Eu\nrope? Why you would see the disin\ntegration of this union in a very few\nyears. Do you now hear any com\nplaint because Iowa and Kansas, for\ninstance, have no seaports?\nTariff boundaries are not only in\njurious to trade, but they engender\nhatred and strife, and make each cit\nizen look upon the injury of his\nneighbor across the boundary as a\ncivic virtue.\n"Oh! but we must preserve our\nhome market and labor from the\ncheap products abroad," I hear the\nprotectionist say. "We must export\nmore than we import in order to be\nprosperous.\nWhat profound stupidity. Why then\nare not Ireland and India properous?\nFor their enormous exports they, get\nhardly anything back.\n.The natural way goods move is\nfrom where they are cheap to where\nthey are dear. Wheat and beef, for\ninstance, move from the prairies of\nthe west, where it is cheap, to Eng\nland, where it is dear. Broadcloth\nand cutlery from England, where\nthey are cheap, to the towns and\nprairies of the west, where they are\ndear. Each country should import\nmore than they export. The protec\ntionist\'s ideal would be\' to reverse this\norder.\nKeep goods from coming into the\ncountry! That is what England is\nnow doing to Germany in time of\nwar. That is what the protectionista\nA; -\' -', 'do in time of peace. Their theories\nare now put to the test and found\nwanting. During this last year our\nexport trade has nearly doubled, our\nimport trade checked even far more\nthan their highest tariff ever checked\nit Further, immigration of the so-\ncalled pauper labor of Europe has\nbeen entirely shut out Their ideal\ncondition is here now. Why have\nwe not prosperity? Why this beating\nof toms-toms to nurse it back to life?\nWhy this universal discontent and\narmy of unemployed? Ralph Nash,\nBUT WE CAN\'T GET IT! We\nhave heard the cry, "Money short\nage," for years. Statistics of Ghica\ngo national banks just issued show\nthat deposits in \'these institutions\nhave increased over $41,000,000 since\nthe last of June. Loans and dis\ncounts show an increase of but $11,\n000,000, leaving a surplus of $30,000,\n000 lying idle in the vaults of these\nvarious banks.\n"Be optimistic" is the watchword\nof the well-fed plutocrat. Optimism\ndoes not buy a ton of coal, neither\ndoes it wipe the frown from the gro\ncer\'s face when you ask him for an\nother month\'s grace on your bill.\nDespite prosperity parades and ex\npositions, Chicago still has its army\nof unemployed. You have heard the\nhired booster loudly proclaim: "Em\nployment may be had by all who wish\nto work." The crowd that packs the\ncorner of Fifth av. and Madison st\neach day waiting for the early edi\ntion of the Daily News bears me out\nin my assertion that this is a .deliber\nate falsehood. Almost every emotion\nfrom hope to despair can be seen\non the faces of this army of the un\nemployed. Why must the working class, the\ncreators of wealth, walk the street\nday after day, seeking employment,\nwhile $30,000,000 lies in the vaults\nthat could be used for constructive\npurposes, thus giving employment to\nall?\nIs there a solution to this problem?\nWas money coined to be hoarded in\nvaults or to be kept in circulation?\nEdw. Freeman.\nDISCUSSING THE POLICE. I\nam not sure that this is the best time\nto expose the police department, with\na view of bringing about a change in\nboth the personnel and the system,\nand agitation on any other lines is\nworse than useless.\nThe "coppers" are no worse now\nthan they have been under former\nmayors. They were as ready in the\npast to play their hirelings\' part as\nthey .are now. Time and place make\nlittle difference to them, for, with\nhere and there an exception, they\nare hirelings by nature.\nI speak of the rule and not of the\nexceptions, and as a rule a "copper"\nis much like a dog. He will chase\nand bark and bite at the command of\nhis master, no matter who the vic\ntims nor how sacred the cause in\nwhich they are engaged.\nThe American boy despises the\nHessians, but does not stop to see\nthat the Hessian was only a "cop,"\nand the "cop" only a Hessian. In\nfact, the "cop"- is far more responsi-"\nble for his moral shortcomings than\nthe Hessian was, for the Hessian had\nno alternative except to turn on his\nprincely master, while the American\n"copper" can at any time resign and\nturn to honest, decent labor.\nThere is no moral justification for\nthe copper obeying the command:\nGo break the strikers\' heads. Yet\ncoppers do these things and most of\nthem are so absolutely ignorant of\nmorals and equity that they do not\nrealize the extent of their crimes.\nOne reason for this is that our po\nlice system recognizes bone and mus\ncle as the fittest test for applicants\ninstead of gentleness, alertness, in\ntelligence, education.\nAvoirdupois counts for more be\nhind a Hessians\' club, in the eyes of\nour predatory master class, than in\ntelligence, and this class dictates our\npresent police system. And this phys-\nMiiittiiiililiftitiiMiiii', "ical brute is armed with club and\ngun and then sent out to do the\nwork of a pirate master.\nUnder our present police system\nfew policemen can remain honest\nand humane.\nOur police sjstenris a putrid mess,\nand while it remains as it is a sys\ntem of protection for predatory in\nterests and other wealthy lawbreak\ners it can be nothing else.\nI have thought for many years a\ngreat city would have more decency,\nmore peace, less thievery and black\nguardism, and surely less taxes on\nthe overburdened taxpayers if it had\nno police at alL\nBut if we are to have police let us\nselect them for their general intelli\ngence, the information they can give\nthe citizen when desired, their kind\nness of heart, their education, and\nnot for the strength of their arms or\nthighs. T. P. Quinn.\nPOLITICAL SUPERSTITION.\nDuring the last municipal election a\ngroup of Chicago workingmen were\nignorant and foolish enough to pub\nlish a full-page advertisement in the\nnewspapers asking other working\nmen to vote for Thompson for mayor\nbecause his election, they declared,\nwould restore prosperity to the city\nand in particular to the steel indus\ntry. Conditions in the steel trade and in\ngeneral are now better than they\nwere early last spring, and undoubt\nedly many of these workers think\nthat Thompson's election is the\ncause. But how can a local election,\nor any election, affect an industry,\nthe prosperity or depression of which\ndepends on the general market and\ntrade conditions not only of the en\ntire continent, but of the world?\nThere is more work in Chicago\nnow than last winter and spring, but\nthis is not due to the present city ad\nministration, and no one knows how\nlong it will last Production and ex\nchange are governed by economic\nlaws and are not affected by elections\nand politics any more than a dog's\nbarking at the moon affects the\nmovements of the planets.

One of the best clumsy jobs\ndone lately was the arrest of two in\nvestigators for the- city welfare de\npartment Louise Osborne Rowe,\ncommissioner of that depaitment,\nwanted to see how far the cops go in\npinching women on the streets with\nout law, excuse or reason. Here is\nprinted the complete report made by\none of the investigators. It is only\none more convincing document piled\non top of many others lately showing\nwhat a course-mouthed, clumsy\nbunch of coppers have been put on\nstrike duty. Following are official\nreport sheets:\nOn. Oct. 27, 1915, about 4:45 p. m.,\nI arrived at the shop of Lamm & Co.,\ntailors, 846 W.. Jackson blvd., and be\ngan walking around the block. I was\naccompanied by a garment worker, a\ngirl about 20 years of age. There\nwere few passersby on the street\nabout six or eight officers patrolling\nthe block, several mounted officers\nriding about and two patrol wagons\nstationed at either end of the block.\nI had walked about the block once,\nduring which time one of the mount\ned officers and one of the patrolmen\nspoke to the little garment worker,\nreceiving no reply. When the sec\nond circuit around the block was be\ngun we reached a group of officers\nwho passed remarks about walking\nall around the block, or "finding\nyourselves in a wagon," whereupon\na young lady, who had joined us,\nstopped and began explaining her ac\ntions just how she was walking\nto these officers. I proceeded right\nalong without any hesitation, the\ngarment worker being with me, hold\ning my arm. Before I had walked\nmore than three feet an officer said\nto me: "You are arrested, too. Take\nthem to the wagon. I\'ll learn you to\nkeep off the streets." We were then\nwalked to the wagon at the end of\nthe block, accompanied by three or\nmore officers. I asked the officer if I\ncould not be taken to the station on\na street car or walk. He said: "No.\nWho are you that the wagon is not\ngood enough for you? You will go\nlike the rest"\nI said: "I understood that I was en\ntitled to go in a street car and that\nwas why I asked to be taken that\nway." Thereupon I was pushed into\nthe wagon and the guard, whose\nnumber is 3,402, opened up a volley\nof abuse about dictating to officers\nhow I should go to the station. He\nsaid: "Oh, you are from Hull House.\nYou know everything. We will have\nto get a taxi to take the Hull House\npeople to jail,"\nHe was silenced only by the ar\nrival of two or three officers, who\nwere dragging a man about 55 years\nold, evidently a picketer, to the wag\non. They thrust him in with great\nviolence and for several minutes aft\nerward he kept saying: "Oh, you\nhave hurt my arm.". He then said:\n"And they call this free America."\nThereupon the same guard, whose\nnumber is 3,402, began again in abus- \'\nive, insolent tones saying: "How long\nare you in America?" he answered:\n"Twelve years." Have you your cit\nizen\'s papers?" "No." "You ought to\nbe shipped back to Russia in the\nmorning by wireless. Too bad\nthat they do not kill all of you off\nover there; coming over here taking\nwhite men\'s jobs. You won\'t work\nyourself, you are too lazy, and you\ndon\'t want any one else to work, etc.,\netc," to which the man replied not\na word.\nFrom time to time the various of\nficers came to the door of the wagon\nand tauntingly called In to the little\ngarment worker: "Hello, Fannie.,\nHow many rides is this for you, etc."\n(It seems this little garment worker,\nhad been arrested once or twice be\nfore for picketing.) I took exception\nto these familiar remarks, saying it;\ngte\ni', 'was not the officer\'s business or duty\nto talk in a familiar, insulting man\nner to any woman and I wanted it\nstopped. Thereupon the guard (No.\n3,402) began a fresh volley of inso\nlence, again taking Hull House to\ntask, although there had been no\nmention by any one or reason to\nthink any one present was from Hull\nHouse.\nWe were kept in the wagon from\n5:10 until 6 o\'clock, when I asked\nhow long we would have to wait The\nsame insulting man answered: "Un\ntil 12 o\'clock, if we feel like it;\nwhether Hull House likes it or not"\nWhen I got to the Desplaines street\nstation and. had my record entered I\ngave my professional card (upon\nwhich appears the name and address\nof the city welfare department, tele\nphone number and commissioner\'s\nname) to the matron, I asked to be\nallowed to telephone to the commis\nsioner of public welfare myself. This\nwas denied and I was locked up in a\ncell with the women who came in\nwith me.\nWhen we were going to the cells\nthe little garment worker stepped to\nthe left rather than to the right, and\nan officer in the station called out:\n"Fannie, you have been here before\nand you know where to go," and the\nlock-up keeper added: "Oh, Fannie\nwants to get back where the boys\nare."\nI was locked up 10 or 15 minutes\nwhen the matron, accompanied by\nan officer, came to the. door of the\ncell and said there was some one up\nstaus to bail is out I asked wno\nit was and she said she thought it\nwas a union man. I hesitated and\nsaid that the commissioner would be\nthere later and asked if she had been\ntelephoned to. The matron said:\n"You had better go upstairs if you\ndon\'t want to stay here all night"\nThe bondsman proved to be a union\nman and papers were made out for\nrelease. The desk sergeant handed\nme the paper to sign. I looked it over\nT represented the union. Not knowing\nthe man by name I asked the ser\ngeant, pointing to the name: "Who is\nthis?" He said: "What difference\ndoes it make to you?" then gave the\ninformation, saying: "You appear to\nmorrow morning in the boys\' court"\nI inquired: "Why the boys\' court?"\nHe replied: "That is none of your\nbusiness; find out from the judge in\nthe morning." When about to leave\nthe station I asked an officer who\nwas standing by if he would change\na dollar so that I might use the tele\nphone -there in the station. He said\nhe had no change, and although\nthere were three or four other offi\ncers and a desk sergeant within hear\ning distance, no one offered to dp\nthe favor. The union man who had\nfurnished the bail stepped forward\nand made the change.\nIn the morning when I appeared\nbefore Judge Trude the officer who\nhad ordered the arrest made did not\nappear himself, detailing another of\nficer, who reported to the judge that\nI had been arrested for loitering. The\n\'judge dismissed the case.\nimr .nuwuit\nUUINUUUWN!\nw-\'\no o\nWinter winds have already beerun\nrj saw the name of this-man whol-\nto show good form.\n1mmmmmammmtmm', 'MPPMWIV\nTELEGRAPH BRIEFS\nWashington.
