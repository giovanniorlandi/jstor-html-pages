He pays as careful attention to s matter submitted to him\nby a Socialist or a Democrat as though it came from one of his\nown political faith. That is why he is the busiest man in the\nHouse of Representatives,- why he denies himself vacations when\ncongress is not in session, why he expends more for clerk hire and\noffice expense than the allowance granted him, paying the difference\nout of his own pocket.

Grant Miller, the Socialist . candidate for United\nStates senator. They heard a most bitter, and most logical, arraign\nment of the Pittman land bill. It was great temerity on the part\nof Mr. Miller to make this denouncement in the home town of the\nDemocratic senator, but he was not chary in his criticism.\nOne telling point that he made was that the 7,000,000 acres of\nland to be set aside for sale at public, auction were not "to be\nselected," but had already "been selected," and that before the\nbill was introduced in the senate.\nThe speaker, whose politics are not those of the Bonanza, nor\nof the Republican party, nevertheless rang true in his denuncia\ntions. He spoke at length of the vast loss to the state through the\nwithdrawal of federal aid in the conservation of storm waters and\nthe development of underground flows, the natural consequence of\nthe passage of this bill, and was most eloquent in his deprecation\nof a law that would throw the homesteader out of business and\nthus put an eternal quietus upon the development of Nevada\'s\nagricultural resources.\nThe address was not one in the interests of Mr. Piatt, at least\nnot so intended, for the speaker had his criticisms also for the\nRepublican candidate, but the effect of the address waa to transfer\nvotes, from the Democratic candidate to the i Republican, aa well\nas to strengthen his own candidacy. This was the first extensive\nexposition that has been made in Tonopah on the demerits of the\nPittman land bill, which has become one of the greatest issues in\nthe state campaign.\nNOT FAVORABLE TOWARD THE LAW\'S DELAYS\nT HERE was a time when the court records of the second judicial\ndistrict largely consisted, of entries of delays and postpone\nments. The mills of the law may have ground fine, but they also\nground exceedingly slow. It was the common custom for a judge\nupon submission of a case to take it under advisement, which meant\ndelay of months, to the loss on both sides of the controversy.\nIt was commented upon at the time that the first case heard by\nJudge T. F. (Barney) Moran was one involving fine points of law\nas well as heavy financial interests. It was a case with little merit,\nalthough it might have been held in the courts for years and a\nuseful industry have been crippled. By applying the same prin\nciples to the trial that he did to acquainting himself with the law,\nJudge Moran burned the midnight incandescent during the trial\nof the case and each night looked up all the authorities cited during\nthe day. When argument was concluded he merely said: "The\ncourt has examined all the authorities cited and its decision is that\nneither plaintiff nor defendant take advantage from this action and\nthat each side pay its own costs."\nThe supreme court bore out this remarkable ruling, remarkable\nonly because of the fact that it had scarcely a precedent and\nshowed the manner of man that had been elevated to the district\nbench. Nor does it evidence that Judge Moran takes snap judgment.\nIf he had delayed his decision for ninety days it would have been\njust as it was in the bench ruling. It merely demonstrated the\ncaliber of the man, one who believes in speedy and accurate justice\nand whose two terms upon the bench have developed his capacity\nand attainment. Judge Moran should be and will be the next\njunior justice of the supreme court of Nevada, a position which he\nwill fill with credit to himself and advantage to the state and its\npeople.\'\nTHE STROLLER,\nBY L B.

I have no business to butt into Mr. Sanders\', Mr. Pitt\nman\'s, nor Frank Dunn\'s campaigns, nor have they any reason to butt into\nmine, except ON ORDERS FROM THE MACHINE CHIEFS They have\nall butted in with the dirtiest kind of work the kind that all decent men\nand women abhor. \'\nMr. Slavin of Colorado brother in law of Ed Malley, the "de-facto"\nsheriff of Nye County informed hfs chief that the citizens of Nye county\nwere rebelling against the machine government, and that I had exposed\nto public gaze the Interior conduct of the office, and that the people were\nflocking to Balliet as the emancipator of the county jrrpm servitude, and\nasking Malley to "get some dope on Balliet." Slavin. went- all over the\ncounty\' in an automobile telling that I "had beeh in the penitentiary\nsomewhere" and starting rumors everywhere that I had murdered a man\nIn AlRska. As the Malley and Pittman machines work together, one Wm\nWood burn, who was appointed as V. S. District Attorney by Pittman\nNevada\'s "carpetbagger" Senator, who now has a home in California waa\ninduced to write to the Clerk of the United States Court for the record of\na law suit between two mining companies, where I was accused of a\nmisdemeanor years ago, to see if they couldn\'t make something nasty\nout of it. Now I don\'t know Woodburn never saw him nor heard of him\ntill he was appointed to the office he tries to fill. Yet Woodburn lent his\naid to the machine candidate for sheriff, and wrote, using his official\nstationery, and signing his name as U. S. District Attorney, causing the\nclerk of the U. S. Court in Iowa to believe that he had me under arrest\nIn Nevada. Following that, Frank T. Dunn, the assistant in Sanders office,\nsent a wire to the U. S. court, asking for information of the misdemeanor\ncase, and signed his name as "Chief Deputy District Attorney," causing\nthe clerk to believe that he was Chief Deputy United States District\nAttorney, under Wm. Woodburn.\nAll of which wag the dirtiest kind of crooked work, of machine politi\ncians. This caused the Des Moines newspapers to come out Friday night\nwith a report that "Letson Balliet was arrested in Nevada by the\ngovernment." Saturday, the Des Moines Papers wired for particulars\nand received the information that I was "neither arrested nor accused,\nbut is a candidate for sheriff." - ,\nFor this kind of a report to be circulated by a dirty machine politician\nin my own home town, where I was raised, la rotten. Can you imagine\nthe feelings of my mother and sisters and friends with flaring headlines\nIn the papers maliciously and cunningly worked Into the press by the\nlowest kind of politicians of a corrupt machine? Would any self-respecting\ncitizen of Nye county vote for anyone who resorts to such dirty work? On\nthe behalf of the Democratic machine candidate for sheriff and assessor,\nWoodburn, of the Pittman machine, Dunn, a candidate for an office that\nhe Is not worthy of and a deputy for Sanders, also a candidate for a\nhigh office that he is not worthy of, have all gone out of their way to\nthrow mud on me, to help Malley keep his brother in law In the sheriff\'s\nonice 01 ye county against tne outcry of the over burdened citizens.\nWhy? Because the Malley-Slavln machine is working by fair means or\nfoul to help the Plttman-Sanders campaign.\' Not one of the bunch Is\nentitled to a vote of any self respecting voter. Mr. Slavin, who was a next\ndoor neighbor of mine for years, has surprlssed me by stooping to the\nfilthiest kind of underhanded political trickery, against a man who had\nalways been his personal friend. When his little son, Walter, died, I took\nmy automobile, drove It myself, and carried some of bis family and\nmaimy s to tne cemetery ana back, and would do it again. But It is the\nact of an lngrate to attack viciously the man who has done him favors. I\nhave a right to be a candidate tor office as well aa hi nan ;\nNow let me say that I never killed or wounded any man In any way.\nauj my mo, ana never nave neen a witness to any crime of the\nkind. I never was in Alaska In my life, and If another candidate for high\noffice did kill anyone in Alaska, and doesn\'t dare to return there), It was\nnot me. , If another candidate for a high , office has been drunk and\narrested time and again for misdemeanors, and run away from creditors\nand a family in a southern state, and dare not return, it was not me.\nI want to show you how I stand in my own home town, even by the\nclerk of the U. S. court, and the whole court, and attorneys. j\nYears ago. when I was just out of college, I was employed by a\npromoter named W. W. Woodward as a mining engineer to manage the\nWhite 8wan mine In Oregon, a mine that has produced upwards of $3 000 000\nin gold. I had no stock in It except 100 shares that were put in my name\nto qualify me as a director. .\nTwo companies got to fighting for the title nnd f \'\n\'trustee" and "assignee" of the property during the- litigation. Woodward\nwas accused of using the mails with intent to defraud, and when the\npostal inspectors began investigation, Woodward Jaid the blame upon me\nto save himself from the penitentiary. The stockholders stood by me\'\nand Woodward managed to get a misdemeanor charge shifted upon my\nshouldors and the worst penalty that could have been imposed was a\nshort Jail sentence and a fine. I fought the case for four years bringing\nwitnesses from all over the county, which cost me oyei fso.OOO In carrying\non my defense, until I was broke. I didn\'t even have streetcar fare, except\nwhat my father or sisters gave me. "\nMr C C.

Publishers dont publish\neulogies fifteen years later of a man who doesn\'t make good.

One was from an\nautomobile In front of the Mlxpab\nhotel at noon and the other was in\nthe Alrdome in the evening. Both\ntalks were on similar lines. They\nwere largely devoted to the Plttman\nland bill, which is deprecated by Re\npublicans and Socialists alike, as\nwell as a goodly proportion of the\nDemocrats. He said that Its enaction\nwould mean the withdrawal of fed\neral aid for the development of the\nagricultural resources of. this state\nand would mean that citizens Would\nbe deprived of their rights of home\nstead in Nevada, a right that Is con\nsidered sacred. Mr. Miller stated\nthat he had proof that the 7,000,000\nacres of land In the proposed "grant\nwere not "to be selected," but al\nready had been "selected." - The\nspeaker was greeted with hearty ap\nplause at both meetings. \'\'\nSALT LAKE WINNER\nOF THE THIRD PLACE\nBASEBALL SEASON ON COA8T\nENDED WITH GAMES\nYESTERDAY\nStanding of the Clubs\nW.
