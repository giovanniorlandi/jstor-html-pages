However, the night, a symbol of uncertainty and \nfear is also portrayed as a time of revelation, of fellowship, and of \ndivine activities, which neutralises in a sense the seeming polarity \nand tension between night and day, between nocturnality and diurnality.\nThe theological analysis of the night in both the book of Job \nand the Psalter shows Yahweh as absolutely in control of the temporal\norder and it is argued that this has strong implications for \nwisdom theology in particular and for the theology of the HB as a \nwhole. \nKey words: Night, Job, Psalter, darkness \n“The morning cometh, and also the night: If ye will inquire, inquire \nye…” (Isa 21:12) \nA INTRODUCTION \nTo begin, any thorough discussion of night in the (Hebrew) Bible needs to take \ninto account or take its point of departure from the concept of time given that \nnight is a unit of time. Specifically, night is the unit of time which refers to the \nperiod of darkness between sundown and sunrise.\n1\n It begins in the evening at \ntwilight and ends at dawn. By nature, events and human experiences are interwoven\nwith time, which implies that the temporal setting of an event or experi-\nence is important and integral to the event. In other words, events and occasions\nare time-bound or distinguished by time. Brin remarks that, “The deter-\nmination of the time when a given event or action took place is extremely \n                                                            \n*  Article submitted: 10 October 2015; accepted: 30 October 2015.

See Charles F. Pfeiffer, Howard F. Vos and John Rea eds., Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia\n(Chicago: Moody Press, 1976), 1710-1711.  \n', 'Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737     725 \n \nimportant for understanding the situation described.”\n2\n Because night is a unit of \ntime, the activities and experiences that occur at night are worth investigating. \nFrom a theological viewpoint, it is crucial to probe the significance of the experiences\nand events associated with night in the (Hebrew) Bible. \nEven though a number of studies have been done on the concept of time \nin the Bible, very little has been said about night as a unit of time besides a few \nscattered entries in some encyclopedias and dictionaries. This is remarkable \nconsidering that night has existed from the beginning of creation and it is a natural\nphenomenon. Therefore, the question posed to the watchman in Isa 21:11, \n“Watchman, what of the night?” can be appropriated in a volume like this \nwhich is centred on nature and natural phenomenon. Since the watchman’s \nanswer is, “If you would like to enquire about night, go ahead,” this paper \nprobes the theology of the concept of night in the OT, specifically in the book of \nJob and in the Psalter. \nAlthough the Hebrew word ַלְיָלה occurs more than 250 times in at least \n32 of the 39 books of the OT, its frequency of occurrence in the book of Job (21 \ntimes) and the Psalter (31 times) is only paralleled by that of Genesis (30 \ntimes). A thorough study of the theological relevance of the phenomenon of \nnight in the whole of the OT would certainly turn out to be an unrealistic goal in \na short article of this nature hence the delimitation of the subject matter to the \nbook of Job and the Psalter. However, this initial attempt could open up the \ninvestigation of the concept in other books of the OT and in the Bible as a \nwhole. To begin, the book of Job has much in common with the Psalter especially\nwhen it comes to the question of form and genre. Like most of Job which \nis only interspersed with narratives, the Psalms are poetry. Whereas the unit of \nJob 1-2 is regarded as the book’s prologue and ch. 42:7-17 is classified as the \nepilogue, both of which are in narrative prose forms, ch. 3-42:1-6 are poetic.\n3\n \n                                                            \n2\n  See Gershon Brin, The Concept of Time in the Bible and in the Dead Sea Scrolls \n(STDJ 39; Leiden: Brill, 2001), 25. \n3\n  Seow notes that Job is a combination of a prose framework and a poetic middle; cf. \nWolters who says, “The Book of Job is poetic throughout, and almost entirely formally\npoetic” i.e. the poem is “framed within a partly prose Prologue and Epilogue.” \nWhybray explains that the body of the book is in poetical form primarily because \npoetry is more suitable for the expression of complex emotional scenes than prose. \nSee C. Leong Seow, Job 1-21: Interpretation and Commentary (Illuminations; Grand \nRapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2013), 27; David Wolters, Deep Things out of Darkness: A \nBook of Job: Essays and a New Translation (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B Eerdmans,\n1995), 22, 67; Norman Whybray, Job (Readings; Sheffield: Sheffield Phoenix \nPress, 2008), 3. The Psalter is also composed notably as poetry. See Nancy L. deClaissé-Walford,\n“The Theology of the Imprecatory Psalms,” in Soundings in the \nTheology of the Psalms (ed. Rolf A. Jacobson; Minneapolis, Minn.: Fortress, 2011), \n \n', '726       Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737 \n \nThe poetry of the Psalms is said to appreciate the beauty of nature and the God \nof nature. Both the Psalter and Job also contain numerous images of nature and \nnatural phenomenon. Fyall observes that, “The imagery of nature in Job is part \nof the Bible’s presentation of creation which is at the heart of the biblical \nstory.” He further shows that the “Image of nature occurs widely throughout \nthe book,” that is, animal, botanical, cosmological images, among others. Eaton \nconfirms that the Psalms also offer perspectives on creation and the animal \nworld, among other things.\n4\n \nFurthermore, the book of Job is ascribed to the genre of Wisdom Literature\njust as a number of Psalms are regarded as wisdom Psalms.\n5\n In terms of \ncontent, some aspects of Job’s speeches also bear striking resemblance to some \nPsalms of lament. On a thematic level, the key theological theme in the Psalter \nis the focus on God or the God-centredness just as in the book of Job in which \nJob wonders where God is in his whole predicament.\n6\n Following the Vulgate, \nmost modern versions of the Bible place Job before the Psalms even though in \nsome Hebrew editions, the reverse is the case and a few others place it after \nProverbs in the canonical arrangement. It is therefore also reasonable to examine\nthe concept of night in the two books based on their proximity in the \ncanonical order. No doubt, both books also diverge in several points especially \nin the fact that the Psalter unlike Job was (and still is) essentially a liturgical \nliterature used in cultic settings. \nAgain, it is important that a theological discussion of night in the OT \ntraces its origins to the creation story in Gen 1 where God separated the light \n                                                                                                                                                                               \n90; John Goldingay, Psalms 1-41 (vol. 1 of Psalms; BaCOT; Grand Rapids, Mich: \nBaker Academic, 2009), 37-42. \n4\n  Robert S. Fyall, Now My Eyes Have Seen You: Images of Creation and Evil in the \nBook of Job (NSBT; Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity, 2005), 57; See John Eaton, \nThe Psalms: A Historical and Spiritual Commentary with an Introduction and New \nTranslation (London: T & T Clark, 2003), 3; cf. also James A. Loader, “Seeing God \nwith Natural Eyes: On Job and Nature,” OTE 5 (1992): 350-357. It is interesting that \nof the diverse natural phenomena (including darkness and light) which Loader has \nidentified in the book of Job, units of time such as night and day are missing. \n5\n  Anderson classifies Pss 36; 37; 49:1-14; 73; 78; 110; 112; 127; 128 and 133 as \nwisdom Psalms with Pss 37; 49 and 73 exhibiting stronger features of wisdom. But he \nacknowledges that, “There is much difference of opinion about the criteria for determining\nwisdom psalms and about the number of psalms that should be included in this \ncategory.” See Bernhard W. Anderson, Out of the Depths: The Psalms Speak for Us \nToday (Philadelphia, Pa.: Westminster Press, 1983), 216-217. Cf. Nancy L. deClaissé-Walford,\nReading from the Beginning: The Shaping of the Hebrew Psalter \n(Macon, Ga.: Mercer University Press, 1997), 41-42. \n6\n  Geoffrey W. Grogan, Psalms (THOTC; Grand Rapids, Mich: Eerdmans, 2008), \n231-232; cf. Loader, “Seeing God,” 346-360. \n', 'Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737     727 \n \nfrom the darkness and called the one, day, and the other, night. We now turn to \nthis in the next section.  \nB NIGHT IN RELATION TO DAY AND TO DARKNESS IN THE OT \nDay and night often form a word pair in the OT just as light and darkness, and \nwhereas night is naturally identified with darkness day is associated with light.\n7\n \nIn Gen 1:3, God created the light and proceeded to separate the light from the \ndarkness, calling the light Day (יֹום ?) and the darkness Night (ַלְיָלה). Here we see \nthat God himself was the first to establish a correspondence between night and \ndarkness and between day and light, and to use these to organise time. In Gen \n1:4, he called the light good but did not say the same of darkness. Westermann \nargues that God was in essence expressing “prejudice” towards light.\n8\n However,\nthis may not necessarily be the case. God said the light was good because \nit was the first of his creative acts and he would subsequently comment on all \nother elements of his creation in the same manner. In contrast, darkness was not \npart of that creation; it existed before and predated the creation in Gen 1.\n9\n The \norigin of night in creation in the OT therefore places it squarely within creation \ntheology. In this sense, both Job and the Psalter are identified understandably \nwith creation theology.\n10\n \nAs a word pair, “day and night” is used figuratively in the OT (and in \ncommon parlance) to express a continuous or perpetual process. It is used to \nmark something that takes place around the clock or non-stop (e.g. Lev 8:35; \nJosh 1:8; 2 Chr 6:20; Neh 1:6; Jer 9:1; Lam 2:18). The negative variant, day \nnor night also expresses continuity (e.g. Eccl 8:16; Isa 60:1; 62:6) but on its \nown, day is used as the most basic unit of time which also includes the night \nhours. Thus, in the OT world, the temporal order of the day (in the sense of a \n24-hour period) is morning to night although there have been insinuations that \nthe reverse could also be the case. The preponderance of evidence however \n                                                            \n7\n  See Brin, Concept of Time, 155. \n8\n  Pfeiffer et al confirm that in the Bible, God is revealed as creating and acting in \ntime (Pfeiffer et al, Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia, 1708). Claus Westermann, Genesis: \nA Practical Commentary (trans. D. E. Green; Grand Rapids, Mich.: WmB Eerdmans, \n1986), 8. \n9\n  We should note however, that Isa 45:7 states that God formed both light and darkness.\nPerhaps then, darkness was created in another act that predated Gen 1. \n10\n  Fyall links the book of Job with creation and a major theme in the Psalms is the \ndepiction of Yahweh as the God of creation (Fyall, Now My Eyes, 57-100, 117-174; \nsee also Grogan, Psalms, 246-250; Hulisani Ramatswana, “Conflicts at Creation: \nGenesis 1-3 in Dialogue with the Psalter,” OTE 27 (2014/2): 553-578. In the same \nvein, Perdue has argued that wisdom literature is grounded in the theological tradition \nof creation. Leo G. Perdue, Wisdom and Creation: The Theology of Wisdom Literature\n(Nashville, Tenn.: Abingdon, 1994), 191-192. \n', '728       Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737 \n \nindicates that the ancient Israelites measured the day from morning to night and \nnot the other way round.\n11\n In the order of time in nature, the day is said to precede\nthe night. \nIn the ancient Hebrew world, the night was divided into three watches \nnamely the evening or the first watch (also called the beginning of the \nwatches), the middle watch and the morning watch, approximately and respectively\nfrom sunset to 10.00 P.M.; from 10.00 P.M. to 2.00 A.M.; and from 2.00 \nA.M. to sunrise. The NT taking a cue from the Roman division of time divides \nthe night into four watches namely evening, midnight, cockcrowing and morning.\n12\n Within these divisions of the night, some people could set or post a watch \nduring the night watch (Judg 7:19; Pss 90:4; 119:148), and those who did so \nwere called watchers or watchmen (cf. Ezek 33:7). However, this is not to say \nthat watches were not set in the daytime. For instance, in situations of war, or \nwhen there was a threat from the camp of the enemy, a day watch could be \nposted as Neh 4:21 shows; and watchers could operate around the clock if the \nsituation demanded it. \nGiven that darkness is naturally associated with night, it is important to \nnote that night is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to a time of crisis, of \ndistress, of helplessness or of God’s judgement (cf. Isa 15:1; 21:11-12; Mic \n3:6). It also appears that the association of fear and dread with nighttime is in a \nsense a universal phenomenon that cuts across the boundaries of culture. Brin \nconfirms that, “There is a natural association between fear and nighttime that \nimposes fear through its darkness, more so than it would be connected associatively\nwith daytime.”\n13\n In Africa for instance, one strong reason the night is \nassociated with evil is the belief that witchcraft operations and caucuses take \n                                                            \n11\n  See Cassuto who also points out that the Torah commanded that the observation of \nsome festivals and appointed times should begin on the night of the preceding day, \ne.g. eating the Unleavened Bread on the night of the Passover and fasting on the \nevening before the Day of Atonement. Umberto Cassuto, From Adam to Noah: Genesis\ni-vii (vol. 1 of A Commentary on Genesis; trans. I. Abrahams; Jerusalem: The \nMagnes Press, The Hebrew University, 1961), 29. Brin argues that, “An examination \nof the normal order of time in the Bible indicates, in my opinion, an approach to the \nday that begins with the morning and concludes at night . . . This follows clearly from \nsuch verses as Exod 24:18; 34:28; 1 Kgs 19:8: ‘forty days and forty nights’ . . . We \nclearly see that in elucidating the order of the day, the day precedes the night” (Brin, \nConcept of Time, 158, cf. 155-156; 1 Sam 30:12; Jonah 2:1; Job 2:13; 3:3; Isa 21:12). \nHowever, he concedes that in some instances, the night is placed before the day, that \nis, “the night is used as the starting point for specific reasons related to the text in \nquestion, and not because of some ideology concerning a different system of counting”\n(Brin, Concept of Time, 162). Among others, examples include Deut 1:32; 28:60; \n1 Sam 25:16; 1 Kgs 8:29; Ps 91:5; and Prov 3:24. \n12\n  Pfeiffer et al, Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia, 1787, 1711.  \n13\n  Brin, Concept of Time, 159. \n', 'Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737     729 \n \nplace primarily at night. It is assumed that in the spiritual realm, forces and \nagents of witchcraft prey on their victims in the hours of darkness. Enchanters, \ndiviners, astrologers, occultists, necromancers, and various subterranean forces \ntest their craft and target their victims and opponents at night. Such beliefs are \nwidespread across Africa.\n14\n \nHowever, in Africa, the fear of nighttime is not restricted to spiritual \nactivities. I recall a poignant poem written by Oswald Mtshali in the dark days \nof apartheid in South Africa titled “Nightfall in Soweto.”\n15\n Mtshali graphically \ndescribed the terror and horror that accompanied nighttime in the Soweto of the \napartheid era; a terror inflicted by human agents of darkness – the apartheid \npolice. The poem captures the emotion of fear that is naturally linked with \nnight because of its darkness which in essence typifies mystery, hiddenness or \nthe unknown. Like Job (Job 7:4), Mtshali dreaded the night; he wished night \nwas never created and that time would be frozen into one long day. His comparison\nof night to “a dreaded disease” also seems to echo Job’s view of night \nas a tormentor that pierced his bones (Job 30:17). Again, in crime prone contexts,\nthere is a natural dread of nighttime because of the activities of men of \nthe underworld such as robbers, burglars, rapists, murderers and various assail\n14\n  Zach Kotzé, “The Witch in Psalm 59: An Afrocentric Interpretation,” OTE 21/2 \n(2008): 385. \n15\n  Nightfall comes like  I am the prey; \n a dreaded disease   I am the quarry to be run down \n seeping through the pores  by the marauding beast \n of a healthy body \n and ravaging it beyond repair \n A murderer’s hand,  Where is my refuge? \n lurking in the shadows,  Where am I safe? \n clasping the dagger,  Not in my matchbox house \n strikes down the helpless victim. Where I barricade myself against nightfall. \n I am the victim.   let loose by cruel nightfall \n I am slaughtered   from his cage of death. \n every night in the streets.  I tremble at his crunching footsteps, \n I am cornered by the fear  “Open up!” he barks like a rabid dog \n gnawing at my timid heart; thirsty for my blood. \n in my helplessness I languish. \n Man has ceased to be man Nightfall! Nightfall! \n Man has become beast   You are my mortal enemy. \n Man has become prey.   But why were you ever created? \n       Why can’t it be daytime? \n      Daytime forever more? \n See Oswald M. J. Mtshali, “Nightfall in Soweto,” in A Selection of African Poetry \n(ed. Kojo E. Senanu and Theo Vincent; Essex: Longman, 1988), 257. \n', '730       Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737 \n \nants who operate under the cover of darkness. Similarly, the OT is replete with \nnegative images relating night to darkness and to fear. Without doubt, darkness \nwhich belonged to the elements of chaos at the time of creation lends its power \nto the night so that it becomes scary. But the question is, is nighttime solely a \ntime of dread, of anxiety and of uncertainty? Let us consider the book of Job \nand the Psalms for some clues. \nC NIGHT IN JOB AND PSALMS – BACKGROUND \nThe book of Job recounts the suffering and agony experienced by one man Job, \nwhose friends, using conventional wisdom, tried to persuade him that his situation\nwas the consequence of some misdeeds in his past. Job rejected their \nrationalisation of his sufferings, questioned God’s judgement, and insisted that \nhe was an innocent victim of circumstances. The bulk of the book (i.e. chs. 341)\nis composed of different dialogues between Job and his three friends and \nlengthy monologues which Job addressed to a God who was no longer within \nhis radar. In Job, the hiddenness of God is glaring as he vanished from the \nscene after orchestrating and stage-managing Job’s ordeal. The darkness that \nengulfed Job was compounded by that mysterious absence of God in the subsequent\nstages of the agonising drama of his life. Even as his friends’ words tor-\nmented and taunted him, and his complaints turned bitter and heart wrenching, \nGod refused to show up. Where is God in the midst of the darkness and of the \nhorrors of the night? In the sense of its inscrutability, the idea of theodicy\n16\n \nwhich is a central theme in Job seems to correspond strongly with the mystery \nof darkness and of night embodied in the narrative of Job. To Job, his experience\nwas a nightmare, and the darkness in his soul would simply not go away \nuntil the very end when the hidden God surfaced out of the whirlwind. \nThe book of Job therefore served as a kind of polemic against the conventional\nwisdom that was prevalent at the time of Job which determined that \nwhatever one sows, one would also reap. It shows that indeed the innocent can \nsuffer and experience shadows even at noontime. Job himself and not the \nwicked was the man who “met with darkness in the daytime and groped in the \nnoonday as in the night” (Job 5:14). His story was not by any chance a tale by \nthe moonlight for Job’s night was starless, moonless, and dreadfully long. It \nwas a story that was most difficult to tell. Day unto day for seven days, none of \nhis three friends uttered any speech, and night unto night for seven nights no \none could display any knowledge. The only sound in sight was of sighing, of \nsorrow, of silence. The darkness around Job was a darkness that could be \ntouched, a darkness that could be seen, a darkness too heavy to describe. But in \nthe end, his experience showed that indeed after the darkness of night comes \nthe light of dawn. \n                                                            \n16\n  The book of Job is said to be “unquestionably a theodicy, an essay in the justification\nof the ways of God to man” (Wolters, Deep Things, 68). \n', 'Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737     731 \n \nThe book of Job is composed as a single narrative couched in poetry and \nspeeches uttered by human characters in the persons of Job, his wife and his \nfour friends as well as by spiritual beings in the persons of Satan and God. The \nbulk of the book is composed of disputations between Job and his friends. On \nthe other hand, the book of Psalms is variegated in content and theme, and the \nidentities of its composers and singers remain largely uncertain. Thus, it is not \nan exaggeration to say that the Psalms are difficult to classify especially \nbecause many of the themes and the forms overlap with one another. In terms \nof structure, most scholars readily classify the Psalter into five books but the \nlines of demarcation generally vary.\n17\n Based on content however, Psalms are \norganised into royal psalms, wisdom psalms, lament psalms, messianic psalms, \nTorah psalms, among others, while based on form, they are identified as alphabetic\nacrostic psalms, hymnic psalms, etcetera, all of which are addressed to \nGod.\n18\n Lament psalms are categorised into two – personal or individual and \ncommunal or community laments. Personal laments express the emotions and \nanguish of an individual in distress while communal laments represent the petitions\nof the whole community in a time of crisis or opposition.\n19\n \nNoteworthy however is Brueggemann’s arrangement of the Psalms into \nPsalms of orientation, Psalms of disorientation and Psalms of new orientation \ncorresponding respectively to seasons of wellbeing, “anguished seasons of hurt, \nalienation, suffering and death,” and surprise “when joy breaks through despair.”\n20\n The Psalms of disorientation (Pss 13, 32, 35, 49, 50, 51, 73, 74, 79, 81, \n86, 88, 90, 109, 130 and 143) are said to include personal and communal \nlaments which Brueggemann calls “psalms of darkness.” He writes that, “For \nthat speech of disorientation, I take the personal lament psalm to be the clearest \nand most simple example.”\n21\n The fact that the psalms of disorientation which \n                                                            \n17\n  Compare the classification of the Psalms by Anderson, Out of the Depths, 239242;\nDe-Claissé-Walford, Reading, 48, 33-35; Grogan, Psalms, 21-28, 42; Goldingay, \nPsalms, 23. \n18\n  See Anderson, Out of the Depths, 216-223; De-Claissé-Walford, Reading, 41-43. \n19\n  Walter Brueggemann, The Message of the Psalms (AOTS; Minneapolis, Minn.: \nAugsburg Publishing House, 1984), 58-67. Anderson notes that communal laments \n“were used on fast days when the community was threatened by military foes, famine, \ndrought, or some pestilence such as a locust plague (cf. The Book of Joel)” but in \nindividual laments, it is not often certain what the trouble was. In both forms however, \nenemies have a central place Anderson, Out of the Depths, 82-83. \n20\n  See Brueggemann, Message, 25-167. Examples of Psalms of orientation are Pss 1, \n8, 14, 15, 24, 33, 37, 104, 112, 131, 133 and 145, while Psalms of new orientation \ninclude Pss 23, 27, 29, 30, 34, 38, 40, 47, 65, 66, 91, 93, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 103, 113, \n114, 117, 124, 135, 138, and 146-150. Note also Anderson’s list of individual and \ncommunity laments and the point that the line between the two forms of lament is \nsometimes blurred. Anderson, Out of the Depths, 70-75. \n21\n  Brueggemann, Message, 52, 58. \n', '732       Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737 \n \nfind expression in laments are connected with darkness is striking. It has also \nbeen observed that, “The lament is widely attested in the book of Job; in fact, it \ndominates the book.”\n22\n Perhaps this common feature is due to the experience of \nsuffering which is expressed widely in the Psalter but is also at the heart of the \nstory of Job.\n23\n The question of theodicy also surfaces in the lament Psalms as \nthe psalmist wondered why the innocent suffered but the wicked continued to \nprosper (cf. Ps 73). Suffering clearly gives birth to lament and darkness, while \nnight metaphorically captures the time and peak of suffering. \nIn what follows therefore, we shall consider nighttime in the world of \nJob and of the Psalter. Do both books share common images of night; or do the \nimages depart from each other? A textual appraisal of the two books in terms of \nthe nighttime activities and the actors could offer some theological insight into \ntheir depictions of night. As would be expected, it is not easy to determine the \ncriteria for classifying the expressions of night in the two books primarily because\nof the diverse character of the material and some other exegetes may \nchoose to approach them differently. \nD EXPRESSIONS OF NIGHT IN JOB AND THE PSALTER \nIn both the Psalter and the book of Job, we find various personal musings about \nnight. This is perhaps due to the nature of the content of the two books which is \npredominantly in direct speech. Most of the hints about night are expressed in \ndirect speech and they constitute mainly the reflections of the speakers on night \nas well as their experiences in the night, or the nighttime activities. However, \nthe two books present voices by different characters which at times are in harmony\nand at other points in dissonance with one another. A few observations \nabout the textual data on night are in order at this point. First, in the Psalms, \nday and night are used as a fixed pair five times (Pss 1:2; 32:4; 42:3; 55:10; \n                                                            \n22\n  Claus Westermann, “The Literary Genre of the Book of Job,” in Sitting with Job: \nSelected Studies on the Book of Job (ed. Roy B Zuck; Grand Rapids, Mich: Baker \nBook House, 1992), 53. For Westermann, “Job remains the lamenter” as the lament is \nthe chief component of Job’s personal arguments (Westermann, “Literary Genre,” 60, \n62, italics his). Hartley also shows that the lament is one of the multiple genres in the \nbook of Job which include lawsuit, petition, hymnic lines in praise of God, wisdom \ninstruction, and so forth. John E. Hartley, “The Genres and Message of the Book of \nJob,” in Sitting with Job: Selected Studies on the Book of Job (ed. Roy B. Zuck; Grand \nRapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1992), 68-69. However, Masenya (ngwan’a \nMphahele) faults what she regards as the misogynist character of Job’s lament in Job \n3; Madipoane Masenya (ngwan’a Mphahele), “Her Appropriation of Job’s Lament? \nHer-Lament of Job 3, from an African Story-Telling Perspective,” in Postcolonial \nPerspectives in African Biblical Interpretation (ed. Musa W. Dube, Andrew M. \nMbuvi and Dora Mbuwayesango; SBLGPBS 13; Atlanta: SBL, 2012), 283-297. \n23\n  According to Grogan, the Psalter presents a realistic doctrine of suffering as \n“Many psalms reveal the sufferings of the writers” (Grogan, Psalms, 335-341). \n', 'Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737     733 \n \n88:1) but they are also used together in context at least eight times (Pss 22:2; \n42:8; 74:16; 78:14; 91:5; 121:6; 136:8-9; 139:12) while night is in some cases \nmentioned in parallel to morning (Pss 30:5; 92:2).\n24\n In Job on the other hand, \nday and night as a word pair occurs only once (Job 26:10) but night occurs in \nthe context of day(time) or light a number of times (Job 3:3, 6, 7-8; 5:14; 7:4; \n17:12; 24:14). However, night is used nine times in Job without any recourse to \nday, morning or light (Job 4:13; 20:8; 27:20; 29:19; 30:17; 33:15; 34:25; 35:10; \n36:20) and at least 11 times in the Psalms (Pss 6:6; 16:7; 17:3; 63:6; 77:2, 6; \n90:4; 104:20; 105:39; 119:55, 148; 134:1). \nSecond, of its 23 instances in Job, the word night occurs in the narrative \npart of Job once (2:13) and in the speeches of Zophar once (20:8), of Eliphaz \ntwice (4:13; 5:14), of Elihu five times (33:15; 34:20, 25; 35:10; 36:20), and in \nJob’s laments 12 times (3:3, 6, 7; 7:3, 4; 17:12; 24:7, 14; 26:10; 27:20; 29:19; \n30:17). The remaining two instances occur in God’s response to Job (39:9, 28 \nRSV). Notably, Elihu’s mention of night is essentially in relation to God’s \nnighttime activities, and his use of positive images of the night could be a subtle\nway of softening the dark images expressed by his friend Job in the com-\nplaints. It is remarkable also that about half of the occurrences of night in the \nPsalter are in the psalms of lament (see Anderson’s classification).\n25\n \nThird, there is not always a clear-cut break between the night and the \nday for the distinction is sometimes fuzzy as night dissolves into day and day \ninto night (Ps 139:11; Job 5:14; 17:12; cf.10:22). For instance, Job 17:12 says, \n“They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.” And \nthe Psalmist says in Ps 139:11, “If I say, ‘Surely the darkness shall cover me;’ \neven the night shall be light about me.” As a matter of fact, both light and \ndarkness are alike to God (Pss 74:6; 139:12; cf. Job 18:6; Isa 45:7).\n26\n This \nmelting or fading of night into day and day into night is seen in other parts of \nthe OT. For instance, in Amos 5:8, the house of Israel is encouraged to seek him \n. . . that turns the shadow of death into morning, and makes the day dark with \nnight . . .” In Josh 10:12-13, the day prevailed over the night as the sun and the \nmoon stood still for Joshua to accomplish his goal (cf. also Jer 13:16). \n                                                            \n24\n  In Ps 90:4 however, night is used in the context of yesterday. \n25\n  Anderson, Out of the Depths, 70-77. \n26\n  Of Job 3:3, Fokkelman says, “Day and night are very much involved with each \nother . . . So night penetrates into day and day penetrates into night . . . The polarity of \nnight and day is also that of darkness and light, and as such constitutes one of the \nmost spectacular dualities of the universe, and of our world.” See Jan P. Fokkelman, \nEx. 115, Deut. 32, and Job 3 (vol. 1 of Major Poems of the Hebrew Bible at the \nInterface of Hermeneutics and Structural Analysis; SSN; Assen: Van Gorcum, 1998), \n59. \n', '734       Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737 \n \nFourth, nighttime activities and experiences in the two books are numerous.\nHowever, some things take place both in the day and the night. In the \nPsalms, these include God’s punishment (Ps 32:4); God’s guidance (Pss \n105:39; 78:14); expression of God’s 92:2) ֶחֶסד); fear (Ps 91:5); criminal activities\n(Ps 55:9-10); weeping (Pss 42:3; 88:1) which is more pronounced and \naggravated in the night (Pss 30:5; 6:6),\n27\n or crying out to God (Ps 22:2), and \nmeditation on the word (Ps 1:2 [119:148]). In Job, activities and experiences \nthat are common to both day and night include also criminal activities (Job \n24:14); anxieties (Job 7:4); confusion of the cunning and the wicked (Job 5:14); \nand destruction of the wicked (Job 34:25; 36:20). In both books, activities that \nare associated with the night alone include singing (Job 35:10; Ps 77:6); \nremembrance of God (Pss 63:6; 119:55); staying forcefully awake (Job 7:4; Ps \n119:148); manufacturing of darkness (Ps 104:20); God’s visitation (Ps 17:3); \nGod’s instruction/revelation (Job 4:13-16; 20:8; 33:14-18; 35:11 Ps 16:7);\n28\n \nand the experience of pain (Job 30:17; 33:19; Ps 77:2). Job also makes reference\nto the night he was conceived (Job 3:3) suggesting that in his time, copu-\nlation possibly took place generally at night.\n29\n Above all, although night is a \ntime of rest for the weary worker and those who have borne the burden of the \nday (cf. Eccl 5:12), this is only implied in both books (Job 4:13; 33:15; Ps \n127:2). In time of distress, the night of rest invites only sleeplessness and anxiety\n(Job 7:4; 30:17; Ps 6:6). \nThe activities noted above show that both positive and negative images \nare associated with the night in Job and in the Psalter. Both books also contain \nsimilar nighttime activities. In Job however, not much attempt is made to disguise\nthe pain and anguish that darkness offers or the helplessness of its vic-\ntims. One finds a frequent occurrence of dark imageries, brutally piercing in \ntheir vividness, which are used to accentuate the horrors of night such as \n“shadow of death/deep shadow” (Job 3:5; 10:22), “blackness” (3:5), “grave,” \n“terror,” “cloud,” etc. The book contains more negative images of the night \nthan positive, and most of the dark images of the night emanate from Job \nhimself as he complained to a silent God (Job 3:3-10; 7:3-4; 30:17), while the \nfew positive images in the book occur in the speeches of his friends (Job 4:1213;\n33:14-19; 35:10-11). The only positive thing that Job himself associated \n                                                            \n27\n  Perhaps people find it easier to weep longer and more heavily in the night because \nof the solitude and quiet that the night offers. Intense and uninterrupted contemplation \nof one’s sufferings in the night hours could elicit weeping. \n28\n  Note that a dream/vision of the night could either be revelatory and positive or \nsimply be a nightmare (cf. Job 4:13-16 and 33:14-19). \n29\n  Compare Masenya (ngwan’a Mphahele), “Her Appropriation,” 293. It should be \nnoted also that Job asked for a curse on the day he was born and the night of his conception\n(3:3-10). So grievous was his pain that he asked for the night of his concep-\ntion to be obliterated from the calendar. See Seow, Job 1-21, 323; Fokkelman, Major \nPoems 1, 163. \n', 'Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737     735 \n \nwith the night occurred “in the months past” when his glory was still fresh in \nhim; his root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night upon his \nbranch (29:2; 19-20). Otherwise, to Job, the night was unbearably long (Job \n7:4). In the Psalms on the other hand, although the night is associated with \nterror (Ps 91:5), the horrors of the night are more often tempered by images of \nhope and of the dawn (cf. Pss 30:5; 42:3-8; 77:2, 6-12). The Psalmist expressed \nhis personal distress and emotions in the night as well as his experiences of the \nnight to God, but though his helplessness is real, he does not lose sight of hope \nand of daytime. \nLastly, besides the nighttime activities, nighttime actors in Job and the \nPsalter include God (Job 33:14; 34:14-15, 25; 35:10), the righteous (Pss 22:2; \n42:3), the wicked (Job 24:14; Ps 63:9-10), and spirits (Job 4:15-21). Ironically, \nnight itself is personified as a nighttime actor and Job’s tormentor in Job 30:17. \nJob was a victim of the night which pierced his bones. But animals, birds and \nother elements of nature such as the dew, whirlwind, firmament, moon and \nstars also constitute non-human actors while terror is personified as an agent of \nfear (Ps 91:5). At night therefore, the animals and birds are free to roam the \nforests (Job 39:9, 28; Ps 104:20) as the heavens reveal the glory of the Lord (Ps \n19:1-2). The moon and the stars which are rulers of nightlife engage in YHWH’s \npraise (Pss 136:9; 148:3), and YHWH restrains the moon from unleashing any \nterror on the righteous (Ps 121:6). A tempest carries the rich away (Job 27:20) \nbut the dew covers Job’s branch all night long (Job 29:19). Darkness also could \nbe a covering, the Psalmist believes, but he concludes that the light of the night \nis a better blanket (Ps 139:11). Thus, nighttime activities in the two books are \ncarried out by human and spirit beings as well as non-human beings and elements.\nThe elements specifically the moon and the stars which illuminate the \nnight sky appear to serve as a backdrop of light for the night stage, offering a \nglimpse of the silhouettes of the human and spiritual actors (Job 22:12; Ps 8:3). \nHowever, in night’s tragic scenes, the darkness painfully deepens as the curtains\nclose and the lights fade out – the moon and stars no longer shine (Job \n3:9; 9:7; 25:5). \nE CONCLUSION \nA side-by-side reading of night in Job and the Psalter reveals that even though \nthe wicked take advantage of the darkness of the night to engage in criminal \nactivities and to cause the righteous pain, they have it rough with God. God \nalso chooses the night as the time to confuse and cut them off. He inflicts punishment\nand judgment in the night. And on a positive note, the night is a time \nfor a vertical communion between the righteous and God. At night, God gives \nsongs (Job 35:10); speaks to instruct and to warn (Job 33:14-15); gives counsel \n(Ps 16:7); visits the righteous (Ps 17:3) while the righteous prays/seeks God \n(Pss 22:2; 42:8; 77:2; 88:1), meditates on God’s word and sings to God (Ps \n77:6), among other things. The brief investigation of the concept of night in Job \n', '736       Olojede, “What of the Night?” OTE 28/3 (2015): 724-737 \n \nand the Psalms also shows that God is supremely and solidly in control not \nonly of the night but also of its activities and actors. The Psalmist recognises \nthis fact when he says to him, “The day is yours, the night also is yours . . .” (Ps \n74:16). This observation tallies with the view mentioned earlier that the theological\nfocus in both the Psalter and Job is God. Both books show clearly that \nGod is the main actor in the night as all the other actors (human and nonhuman)\ndefer to him. The positive activities of the righteous as well as God’s \nbenevolence in the night therefore diffuse the tension and negativity which are \nnaturally associated with nighttime. And in a sense the seeming polarity and \ntension between night and day, between nocturnality and diurnality are neutralised.\nThe night of terror and dread is demystified in those moments when \nthe divine and the human commune. The power of darkness is subdued and \norder is maintained in the cosmos, as in the beginning. Untainted by horrors, \nthe sublime beauty of nighttime illuminated by the moon and the stars in the \ndistant sky tames the viciousness of the night. Darkness is exposed as day \ndawns again and the heavens declare the glory of the Lord! \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \nAnderson, Bernhard W.
