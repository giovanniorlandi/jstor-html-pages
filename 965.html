It was\nwritten by Louis Sybcrkroff and first\npublished in a Creston, Iowa, paper and\nproperly credited. An answer to the\nletter has since appeared in a Canadian\npaper, but unfortunately the author\'s\nname was not given, so this paper is\nunable to give the author the credit that\nis his due. The answer to Satan is as\nfollows:\n"Royal Palace, Berlin.\n"My Dear Lucifer: Your kindly let\nter received and its contents noted.

To my mind, Nero was a piker.\nBut on a second thought I realize that\nlie did not possess the many advantages\nI do for carrying on his devilish work.\nHe had no guns that would shoot for\ntwenty miles; he had no gas bombs or\nflame throwers ; he had never had the\nopportunity to drop lombs on school\nhouses and kill little children; he could\nnot send his aviators over towns and\ndrop poisoned candy for the children- to\neat ; he did not have submarines by\nwhich he could sink passenger ships and\nkill hundreds of women and babies.\nTaking all this into consideration, I\nthink that Nero did,prctty well, consid\nering the disadvantages under which he\nworked. If 1 had lived in those days, I\ndo not know as I could have improved\non his methods of raising hell, although\nsome of it looks crude to us now, with\nour refined cruelties.\n"Nero simply murdered his mother in\ncold blood ; I made mine suffer all the\nagony of a broken heart before death\nrelieved her sufferings.\n"I thank you from the bottom of my\nheart for your gifts to me, my abnormal\nambition has made me the most hated\nman in the world.

It has produc\ned an army of a million men maimed,\nwithout arms, without legs and without\nsight. It has bereft some of their reas\non and they will go through life with\ntheir minds a blank. It has robbed\nthousands of women of their virtue, and\nhas brought thousands more into my\nrealms as slaves. My name is coupled\nwith curses in every clime.\n"Untilnow I have always cursed the\nfate which left me with a withered arm,\nbut I now discern your inscrutable wis\ndom.

It was\nEngland that tried to interfere with my\nplans by proposing mediation when I\nhad all my plans set for a world con\nquest England has taught savage peo\nple Christianity and the love of their\nfellowmen, while I have endeavored to\ninstill hatred into their hearts and make\nthem fiends in human form.\n"My hatred for England is only ex\nceeded by my hatred for America. Had\nit not been for that country all Europe\nwould have been helpless at my feet\nlong ago. Shells made with American\nmoney killed my soldiers and for this !\nI can never forgive America.\n"So the secret is out. You hint that\nI had a hand in the Saravejo assassin\nation. I flattered myself that I had\nkept this covered up and no one would\nsuspect that I had any hand in it. Well,\nit is all right, I suppose. You inspired\nit in me, and you have a right to share\nin the secret. You will have toadmit\nthat it was clever of me to be on my\nyacht at the time of the discord and\ntreason among the Russians and thous\nands of these brave people perished\nthrough treachery.\n"Lucifer, you make me laugh at times.\nYou express surprise at my posing as a\npersonal friend of God and telling my\npeople that God will help them to vic\ntory. Can not you see my plans? My\nfriendship with God is simply to de\nlude the poor, simple fools, who are dy\ning that my ambition "may succeed- I\nhave to hand them this bunk once in a\nwhile to keep their breasts bared to the\nenemy. Without it they could quit\nfighting. I tried the same bunk on the\nneutral nations, but they were too clev\nef to believe it.\n"I have taught my people this creed\nsince I came to the throne. The child\nren in the schools are taught to hate all\nthings not German. They are taught\nthat Germany is invincible and any\nthing that I do is not wrong.

The\ngreat war we are waging for freedom necessitates the putting of\nhundreds of thousands of men in the field and keeping them fed and\nclothed.

That is patriotic and highly commendable. But you are not\ndoing enough when you draw money out of the bank and invest it\nin Government securities. You must do more. You must buckle\ndown and make it your own personal daily business to help win the\nwar. You must give up the things you don\'t need.\nThe Government must have money a tremendous quantity of\nmoney and it must have the productive labor of millions of workers\nwho are now making unnecessary articles for you and other Ameri\ncans who can afford to buy them.\nGet the Thrift Stamp Habit\nYou, Mr. Business Man: AVhen you go home tonight, take your\nwife a Thrift Card, with a dozen stamps attached, instead of a box of\ncandy or a box of flowers.
