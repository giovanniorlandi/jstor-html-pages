750000000\nA J Wedderburn special agent\nof the department of agriculture\nsays of these adulterations that\nthey can be truthfully said to be\nas broad as the continent Ac\ncording to his calculations the\nadulteration amounts to an annual\nstealing of not less than 1125\n000000\nThis enormous sum represent\ning stealings of fourteen dollars\nper year from every man woman\nand child in the United States in\ncludes only the thefts through\nadulterations of food It excludes\nadulterations ju wine whiskey\ntobacco drugs and medicines\nThe nation every state every\nlittle town has and

in\nbehalf of adulteration\nYet it is certain that the bill will\nnot be passed\nNo man will take the responsi\nbility of defeating it openly But\nthe glorious senate as a whole\nwill allow it to die
