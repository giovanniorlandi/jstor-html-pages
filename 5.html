        <pre>[' \n  \nO P E N  A C C E S S Research Article\nFactors that contribute to the \ninternationalization of the Qatari \nSmall and Medium Enterprises\nABSTRACT\nThis study aims to identify the factors that the Qatari government can contribute to Qatar’s \ninternationalization of Small-Medium Enterprises (SME). In addition, it highlights the current role \nplayed with a variation of the future proposed programs. The obstacles faced by entrepreneurs also \nhave been identified, and was accompanied by counterparts’ views from the country’s officials. \nThis study involved an online survey shared with 100 business owners and people working in the \nprivate sectors targeted through different mediums with help from Qatar Development Bank and their \nsubsidiaries. The overall conclusion from the data analyzed is that there are still missing factors that \nthe country lacks regulations, facilities, and education. However, there is evidence that the Qatari \nregulator moves in the right direction with the different initiatives and programs. Therefore, even \nthough there are existing facilities, the programs offered do not fit the entrepreneurs’ needs. The \nentrepreneurs lack the managerial and marketing skills and the power in bargaining and negotiation \nwith external stakeholders. \nThe main recommendation is to set national private sector/SME advancement techniques within the \nbroader national advancement translated in a centralized portal based on the overall conclusion. \nDifferent recommendations have been proposed to provide proper training programs’ implementation \nplan. The proposals include the capacity of the Qatari government to actualize sound macroeconomic \narrangements. The training programs to involve the teachers’ development expand the learner’s \nranks, content sharing facility, and instructional methods redesigning. In addition, accessibility to \nloans and advanced finance equity, mainly to medium and long-term opportunities to grow SMEs \nexchange and venture capacity align with the Qatari National Vision 2030, whereas keeping up sound \ngovernment accounts will offer assistance to the accessibility of finance for improvement purposes. \nKeywords: Small & Medium Enterprises, economic development; business needs, Entrepreneurship, \nQatar\n1 Department Strategic Business Unit \nManagement, HEC Paris, Doha-Qatar\n*email: h14q@hotmail.com\nCite this article as: Al-Jaber H.

INTRODUCTION\nSmall and Medium enterprises (SME) are the “engine” for economic development and are considered \ncrucial supporter of the economy’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). They are the essential source of \nentrepreneurship, renovation, and work establishment. In recent years, Qatar has emphasized the \nsignificance of SMEs within the State’s general advancement plans since research indicates that SMEs \naccount for more than 80% of the registered companies. Therefore, the Qatari government has been \ntrying to leverage the local SME’s performance and businesses by implementing different \ninternationalization development plans for various market segments.\nUnfortunately, to date, most of the Qatari SME’s cannot export their products or services. They are \nnot able to explore nearby markets like the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). In 2012, Qatar recorded \nthe highest GDP per capita worldwide to be $172.9 bn. However, SME’s operating outside the oil and \ngas industry contributed to less than 0.5% to the GDP. Hence; more than 50% of the GDP was from the \noil and gas sector (QDB, 2020). In 2012, there were about eleven thousand SME’s in Qatar, whereas \nhalf of them do not have access to local borrowing nor they do understand the process of getting a \nloan to advance their businesses. Qatar is a tax-free country, but the basis of the offered programs is \nnot adequate for SME’s as it hides some legally binding commitments from the entrepreneurs of small \nbusiness owners. Qatar and other GCC countries concentrated on the oil and gas sector to ensure its \nhigh income and thoughtless about identifying the long-term drivers for a diversified economy. The \nlack of innovation and diversification and focus on one industry created a layer of employment without \nexposure to other sectors to add the preserved value, i.e., business development and creation for \nnon-oil and gas sectors.\nEnterprise Qatar (EQ) was launched in 2011 aiming to promote small and medium enterprises with \na vision to be the focal point for SME’s and the driver of economic diversification and entrepreneurial \ninnovation in Qatar. Also, it aims to create a conducive and inventive network with an entrepreneurial \nspirit and business development. As well as assisting SME’s accomplishing distinction of business \nexecution and (EQ, 2012)\nEnterprise Qatar’s trial did not drive any local enterprise to be a key player in the market, at least \nin its first three years. In parallel, the Qatar Development Bank (QDB) was taking over the initiative and \nreplacing EQ gradually. On the other hand, “Nama,” another entity, enabled social entrepreneurs to \nenhance their skills and train them to lead the journey. In 2014, QDB and Nama introduced Qatar \nBusiness Incubation Center (QBIC), situated in the new industrial area in the far south of Qatar’s urban \nlife.\nQatar’s National Development Strategy 2011-2016 represents a system and driving force to \naccomplish the results defined on the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030. Whereas the QNV 2030 sets \nout the main objectives of Qatar and recognizes its needs, the NDS interprets the vision into a physical \nplan and a system for stakeholder engagement over the period 2011-2016.\nThe QNV recognizes economic diversification and private sector development as two main drivers \nof the economic improvement pillar. In addition, the key aim of economic diversification and private \nsector development (EDP NDS) is to attain financial and social supportability and success. Thus, the \nNational Strategy gives a vital track to help the country accomplish this objective and defines a \nphysical activity plan for its usage. The framework includes three key points: objectives, desired \noutcomes and interventions along the key focus area (Qatar National Development Strategy 20112016,\n2011).\nInitiatives have started since then to show the best of what the government entities can do to \nenable the local SME’s to be critical players in the economy such as Jahez 1, Jahez 2 and Bedaya. Other \nservices were introduced later, like the SME equity program where venture capitalists and investors \ncontribute to them in an open event. SMEs Funding, export financing, export insurance, and direct \nlending were other programs offered by different organizations. \nThe current Qatari economic environment reflects on the complex incorporation of global \neconomies. In the past five years, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)1 are highly influenced \nby globalization as they gradually forced to operate at international levels.\nDespite the above endeavors to support SME, the factors that would impact the successful \ninternationalization of the Qatari SMEs were not investigated. So while having a significant influence, \n1 The European Commission (2009) defines SME as a private company with fewer than 250 employees, with an annual \nturnover inferior to €50 million and with an annual total balance sheet lower than €43 million.\n', 'Al-Jaber\n3Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\nthe main question arises, “What are the factors that contribute to the internationalization of the Qatari \nSMEs?”. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to study various elements such as the \ndifferent obstacles facing SMEs internationalization, including the geographical location, access to \nadvisory, access to additional services, and other relative concerns for the Qatari entrepreneurs.\nThis paper will also highlight the factors enabling the government to build a well-standing platform \nfor international appearance. It will mainly focus on two sectors: Retail and Food and Beverages. \nMoreover, this paper will study the main motivations that will help in the internationalization of \nQatari SMEs after going through the obstacles facing this process and its impact on the enterprise \nitself (Table 1). The influence of decision-makers in the enterprise will be analyzed as well as the \ntheoretical models of business internationalization will be mainly explained. To this end, several \nrecommendations shall be proposed to support SME’s internationalization in Qatar.\nTable 1: Different barriers to Internationalization (Zoran Paunović, 2010).\nBARRIERS TO INTERNATIONALIZATION MOST \nIMPORTANT\n1.

METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Main Research questions\nThis study is structured to answer a main question; “What are the factors that contribute to the \ninternationalization of the Qatari SMEs?” In connection to that, potential research sub-questions \nhave been formulated to enhance the research’s value and to build up the research’s online survey \nquestions and the in-depth interview questions. The purpose of formulating the sub-questions is only \nto link them to the main research questions without directly answering them.\n● R1: What are the SMEs views on the Qatari market? What are the segment contributions to the \noverall economic portfolio?\n● R2: What is the SME contribution to Qatar’s total GDP?\n● R3: What are the different key characteristics of the SME sector?\n● R4: What are the major obstacles facing the SME sector in Qatar? \n● R5: What are the major challenges confronting SMEs internationalization in the Qatari F&B sector \nand Retail sector?\n● R6: What is the financial performance of the SME sector?\n● R7: What are the consequences of SME segment failure?\n● R8: How do financial institutions and other potential organization support the SME segment to \n', 'Al-Jaber\n4Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\novercome the identified challenges? \n● R9: What are the different challenges facing these potential organizations? What improvements \ndo they require to implement their supportive strategies?\n● R10: What are the steps required to overcome the various challenges facing SMEs? How can we \naddress entrepreneurs’ objectives depending on the governmental and financial market?\n2.2  Qualitative Method\nThe questions utilized within the interviews were freely organized, permitting the participants to direct \nthe questioner through their experiences. However, the interview questions before interviewing the \nparticipants were associated with a priori subjects’ choice, guaranteeing the particular investigation \nquestions answered. \nIt is essential to understand the significance of a pilot study in guaranteeing those participants’ \ninquired questions and permit the analyst to practice the interview’s semi-structured nature. Interviews \nconducted with two members of the business owners’ group .In arrangement for the office interviews, \nthe questions’ wordings were balanced to energize the members to reflect on personal encounters. \nThus, this guarantees a semi-structured interview with the related beneficial results.\n2.3 Quantitative Method\nAn online survey conveyed to 100 business people in Qatar was done using the online “Survey \nMonkey” frame. The overview was comprised of 53 questions utilizing English dialect. The dissemination \nlist was compiled with supervisors’ help at the Qatar Incubation Centers for entrepreneurs. All the \nsurvey data were arranged in the questionnaire’s introductory statement. The members took around \n10-15 minutes to answer the survey.\n2.4 Sampling\nThe sampling is critical during both quantities and qualitative research as few individuals were \nincluded. Purposive sampling permits the utilization of judgment while choosing participants that \nbest help in the research objectives (Mark Saunders, 2009). \nNine distinguished participants were chosen for the initial interview. The primary contact method \nselected to conduct the required data was by interviewing in-person, where the research point \ndefined, and the participants’ potential necessities clarified. Consent forms were prepared and filled \nby the writer at the time of the interview.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n3.1 Issues and challenges facing SMEs internationalization in Qatar’s F&B sector\nThe first chosen sector that shall be studies in this research is The Food and Beverage (F&B) sector \nsince it is an important part in understanding internationalization.\nThe F&B sector in Qatar includes five segments: Fine dining, casual dining, fast food, cafes and \nothers such as cafeterias and desserts outlets. The growth drivers that Qatar has witnessed contribute \ntowards the development of the F&B sector, and directly connect to the changes that took place in the \ninfrastructural scene and economic development undertaken by the Qatari government. The five \nprimary growth drivers are shown in Figure 1.\n', 'Al-Jaber\n5Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\nFigure 1: The five growth drivers affecting the F&B Qatari sector (MERatings, 2019).\n3.2 Issues and challenges facing SMEs internationalization in the Qatari retail sector\nRetailing has become a vital part of any business where more retailers are aiming to grow by extending \ntheir processes globally. Retail internationalization is the exchange of retail operations outside the \nnational market. It includes the international exchange of retail concepts, administrational skills, \ninnovation and the buying process. \nThe first step in understanding internationalization is to realize the business opportunities behind \nthis practice. Many factors can help in expanding retail business worldwide. In the Qatari market, \nthese factors are divided into two major categories: Proactive and reactive motivations. \nThe Proactive motivations are the internal factors in the company that force retailers to expand \nand grow internationally. The most important aspect is to gain more profit through expanding, \ntargeting new customers and developing new innovative ideas. On the other hand, developing a \nunique product or service can also be one of the proactive motives why Qatari retailers aiming to \nexpand globally. \nThe second type of motivation includes reactive motivations that force the Qatari companies to \nrespond directly to environmental changes without getting the chance to set trails. Competitive \npressure is the main reactive motive, which forces Qatari retailers to fear losing their market share to \ninternational companies which might results in entering into worldwide market. Another reactive \nmotivation is “overproduction”. \nIn today’s advanced digital market, clients and businesses cooperate, sell, and buy outside their \nlocal borders with more prominent effort to get outside local markets, many Qatari Retail businesses \nare looking to extend abroad and to offer international products and services.\nSome of the main challenges for SME’s internationalization are the cultural challenges, language \nbarriers and different communication styles. In addition, shipping costs, duties, taxes, export laws and \nregulations.\n3.3 Interviews and surveys results and discussions\nThe data collected and analyzed for both the quantitative and qualitative methods. The results \nreflected the key findings using statistical methods to calculate and compare the results. The online \nsurvey sent to 100 business owners and people working in the private sectors targeted through \ndifferent mediums with the help of QDB and their subsidiaries out of which 60% of them completed. \nThe results show the fair distribution between both genders in the Qatari community and \nwillingness for both genders who own and run businesses to respond to the survey.\n', 'Al-Jaber\n6Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\nIt is fair to see the number of Qatari respondents is two times the non-Qatari, this is for the fact that \nthey are the main pillar for their country’s economy progression and their replies reflects on their \nwillingness to accept challenges and suggest improvements to export their products and services.\nFigure 2: Responses by organizational role.\nThe results also explain the different levels of the respondents’ educational level. The majority \nholds a bachelor’s degree (41%), while (49%) have master degrees. The more seniority the person, the \nmore this study shall reflect on feasible answers that builds up on comprehensive solutions and \nrecommendations.\nThe majority of survey respondents have more than seven years of business experience (35.59%). \nThese results reflect on the professionalism and accuracy given by the majority of entrepreneurs, \nwhich will help in developing a competent implementation plan to expand the internationalization of \nQatari SMEs.\nMoreover, the results obtained show that the respondents have mostly started their businesses \nusing their personal savings in the F&B sector. However, about 25% of them preferred not to mention \ntheir annual revenue. In addition, it is clear that most of them prefer to establish a Limited Liability \nCompany under the coverage of the Qatari commercial law. \nThe results also show that the primary motivational reason that pushed most respondents to build \ntheir own business is to have financial dependency (37.25%). Other important motivational factors \nwere related to making extra money and income (23.53%), while others considered establishing their \nown business fulfills their dreams (17.65%). Thus, this reflects on most business owner’s mentalities, \nwhich was a result of influential cultural and educational factors. Therefore, it is essential to study \nmost business owner’s personalities to develop the right plans and develop their own business \ninternationally.\nFigure 3 shows some of the advantages of SMEs in Qatar. One of the advantages that SMEs have \nin the Qatari market is the quick reaction to marketplace changes (25%) since governmental support \nby continually updating business regulations helps in protecting many SMEs from heavy financial loss.\n', 'Al-Jaber\n7Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\nFigure 3: Advantages of SMEs in the Qatari Market.\nHowever, one of the main disadvantages of owning an SME in the Qatari market is related to the \ndifficulties the owners face in reaching many customers (35%). Thus, it reflects that most companies \noperate locally and do not expand internationally to reach different markets and customers. In \naddition, another main disadvantage is the lack of business financing and access to financial support \n(21%). Here, the financial centers and financial institutions’ leading roles should be studied and \ndeveloped to minimize these difficulties.\nFigure 4: Disadvantages of SMEs in the Qatari Market.\nMost of the respondents modestly agreed with the different factors affecting SMEs \ninternationalization as no factor took the highest percentage when it comes to “strongly disagree.” \nHowever, opinions varied from one aspect to another where the lack of entrepreneurial, managerial, \nand marketing skills took the highest percentage (42%) when it comes to “strongly agree”. Another \nfactor that took (42%) on the variable answer “strongly agree” was bureaucracy. In contrast, a fair \nmajority explained that the language difference is not a barrier. However, it is quite debatable since \ntheir responses are almost equal.\nRegarding SMEs internationalization in the Qatari F&B sector, the question variable “agree” took \nthe highest percentage (52%) when it comes to the effect of changing consumer preferences. At the \nsame time, respondents agreed with the importance of other factors on SMEs internationalization in \nthe sector mentioned above, such as import dependency, experienced and competent staff, and delay \nin obtaining licenses and approvals. On the other hand, the main factors affecting SMEs \ninternationalization in the Qatari retail sector, which took more than 70% of the respondents to at \nleast agree that the Qatari government should work on Shipping Costs, Duties, and Taxes with foreign \ncountries to grow internationally. \nThe physical interviews were set with most of the country’s officials who deals with SMEs and \nother business owners. The interviews were very interactive, especially with the entities’ CEO’s and \nleaders. All their answers to the questions were analyzed, to come up in the following chapter with the \n', 'Al-Jaber\n8Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\nrecommendations. Most of the officials were very interested to see the outcome of this study and \nasked to share the suggestions once they are ready. They agreed that Qatar requires an improvement \nin terms of legislation and training, especially in schools. Also, there is a lack of talents in Qatar, and \nthere is an agreement that it is tough to acquire them and transfer them from other companies. The \nnew startups and existing companies’ internal issues are mainly summarised in managing the entities \nfrom HR and finance perspective compiled with lack of knowledge. In contrast, the external problems \nare primarily the legislation and short of export facilities. Qatar’s main advantages for SME development \nare the friendly environment accompanied by support from the government to enhance the SMEs \ngrowth and the existence of different entities that have the mandate to support the SMEs.\nFurthermore, the Lean Startup program offered by QBIC was the most recognized program among \nthe interviewees, and they endorsed its strength as it made many successful stories. In general, the \nQatari regulators move in the right direction though they still need to promote the SMEs internationally \nwhile protecting them and minimizing the competition. Also, the regulators have to keep update the \nlegislation to fit the purpose of the current trend. The final recommendations mainly reiterate the \nimportance of updating the legislation by increasing the export facilities. Further suggestions are \nexplained in the recommendations section.\n4. RECOMMENDATIONS\nFrom the research conducted, there is clear proof that SMEs confront several challenges when \naccessing credit facilities from different financial institutions. It is additionally self-evident that small \nand medium enterprise division is the essential factor of the national economy. \nGenerally, three main recommendations can be made to different entities. Firstly, the government’s \nappropriate offices, including services and divisions concerned with exchange and improvement, \nhave to support the SME segment by making more educational programs, more funding, and expanded \nsensitization regarding SMEs role within the Qatari market. Therefore, this will keep raising interest, \nmotivating youthful business people with the imperative aptitudes to succeed in business, hence \nexpanding the probability of beginning or overseeing companies that will perform well.\nSecondly, industry partners such as banks, controllers, and accomplices of SMEs shall have a \nmore significant role in empowering SMEs victory. Mainly, there is a requirement for more \nstraightforward distributions concerning industry patterns, more comprehensive engagements \nbetween SME managers, and the openings within the market. Further, there is a requirement for a \nmore fierce war against debasement. This contributes to a significant portion of costs to managers \nwho wish to get to financing or other openings within the showcase.\nFinally, SME managers and owners also have a critical role to play. As the data shows that they are \nhighly educated and experienced, this gives them an advantage that should be tapped. As a result, it \nis recommended that managers adopt transformational leadership to deal with financial challenges \nand address capital issues in their organizations. Thus, this will go beyond managing the finances \nefficiently to ensure the effective use of every organization’s resources, including human resources, \nthe brand, technology, and innovation. The leadership of SMEs should also include training junior \nemployees to have a long-term vision and align their goals to the organization, as these issues directly \ninfluence managerial expertise. Consequently, the management would create an ecosystem in which \nresources are used efficiently, thus increasing their financial management capabilities.\nBased on the previously mentioned perceptions, the following detailed recommendations are \nsuggested for proper implementation strategy to motivate SMEs Internationalization. \n4.1 Set national private sector/SME advancement techniques within the broader \nnational advancement translated in a centralized portal, and development \nstrategy through institutionalized forms, as SME advancement involves \nprogressing (With Implementation Plan):\nThis includes the capacity of the Qatari government to actualize sound macroeconomic arrangements. \nThe capability of business partners to create conducive microeconomic business environments. The \nability of SMEs to implement competitive practices and business strategies. Improved public-private \ndialogue and associations with partners (public, private, social society) are essential for distinguishing \nobstacles, effectively prioritizing supportive measures, and making successful investments in fundamental \ninfrastructures and institutions. Moreover, institutionalized public-private dialogue and partnerships \nupgrade ease of execution, political validity, and maintainability of SME advancement procedures. \n', 'Al-Jaber\n9Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\nMultilateral organizations can play a crucial part in encouraging such exchange and organization. This \nwill enhance the flow approach to information and knowledge. Also, will leverage the bureaucracy.\n4.2 QDB & Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI) implementation:\nQDB is recommended to issue a tender for various technological and consultancy firms to establish a \ncentralized platform. This platform scope can be led by consultants in all fields to prepare for all the \ndepartmental requirements in a company i.e. HR, finance, operations, legal, supply chain, inventory, \netc. After preparation, this has to be communicated to the MOCI and the ministry has to gather all the \nstakeholders and entities that approve the licensing in this single platform. The technological vendor \nshall assist in building a smart software that includes all the company’s essential work requirements \nin simple terms that are suitable for the SME’s but at the same time is linked to the governmental \nentities in order to create a friendly business environment. This platform shall be available online, so \nthat with time, it can be obligatory for all SME’s to easily manage their businesses, access tenders and \nmake sure that they are up to date with all the new regulations. The benefit for this is that it shall \nprovide entrepreneurs with the ability to grow their businesses and the country to follow up on the \nbusiness performance. \n4.3 Increase efforts to create and reinforce empowering legal, administrative, and \nregulatory situations at local, regional, and national levels: \nTherefore, property rights are recognized. This shall minimize theexchange costs in setting up and \ndoing business through reasonable, straightforward, and less expensive tax collection, customs, \nlicensing legal, and other administration frameworks and strategies. Moreover, Consistency in \napplying the rule of law for all levels, assurance in battling corruption, and bringing down costs of \nsetting up and doing business would help entrepreneurs “move away” from the informal sector. \n4.4 Encourage accessibility to loans and advanced finance equity, mainly to medium \nto long-term opportunities to grow SMEs exchange and venture capacity (QNV \n2030 Economic development): \nWhereas keeping up sound government accounts will offer assistance to accessibility of finance for \nimprovement purposes. Thus, access to finance may be upgraded by guaranteeing that:\n● Contracts are effectively enforceable through functioning secured transactions and bankruptcy \ncontrol regulations.\n● Issues of collateral and security are overseen competitively (e.g., accessibility of loan guarantees \nfor SMEs, computerized enlistment frameworks for mortgages, leases and pledges).\n● Financial institutions are overseen judiciously and are trusted by contributors.\n● Legitimate systems empower an adequate number and sort of financial rebellious to be utilized \n(e.g., exchange of negotiable and commercial paper such as checks, bills of exchange, and \npromissory notes).\n● Financial institutions other than banks are working, such as insurance companies.\n● SMEs are empowered to keep great bookkeeping records. Without access to medium and longterm\nfunds inside the Qatari economy, SMEs would not be able to form the fundamental \nspeculations in innovations and technologies to grow their exchange capacity and act as \naccomplices to foreign direct investors (FDI). \n4.5 Reinforce infrastructure services delivery to encourage market access and reduce \nthe cost of doing business (QNV 2030 Economic Development): \nMore speculation is required in critical regions such as energy, transportation, and communications. \nConsideration should be given to sustainably managed infrastructure, lowering energy, transport \n(road, air, and seaport), and communication (including international phone and Web utilization) \ncharges, whereas improving these services’ reliability is vital. Encouraging public-private associations \nand attracting FDI into the essential foundation and the establishment of industrial parks for SMEs are \nalternatives that should be considered.\n4.6 Strengthen support structures for private sector/SME advancement, especially \ninstitutional support: \nSME improvement methodology should be facilitated and reviewed at the primary level through a \nlean but high-level institution. Thus, public and private divisions should mutually check SMEs progress \nthrough public-private dialogue mechanisms. SMEs require business services to develop their \n', 'Al-Jaber\n10Page of 11QScience Connect\nVol. 2021(2), Art. 3\ncompetitiveness, such as counseling and preparing bookkeeping and legal factors, promoting and \nmarketing courier services using technology and innovation services. However, support structures \nthat offer these services can be public or private. Still, over time, the concentration should be towards \nmore significant private arrangements so that SMEs quickly changing needs may well be met.\n4.7 Foresee other source of Finance:\nQatar’s financial industry has considered the SME industry a high-risk segment that is reluctant to \nextend credit facilities to SMEs. Therefore, this incorporates a negative impact on SMEs with \nexceptionally excellent potentials/prospects to be unenticing to the financial institutions. Such SMEs \nshould consider other financial sources which offer a lower capital cost than traditional financial \ninstitutions. \n4.8 Proper bookkeeping and bank account: \nKeeping the records of business transactions up to date supports the company in keeping track of its \noperations. Various financial institutions depend on legitimate bookkeeping as criteria for offering \nloans and economic facilities. Thus, SMEs will be at an advantage in case they keep outstanding \ncommerce records. Keeping a bank account with any of the financial institutions will help SMEs have \neasy access to credit facilities. \n4.9 Offer proper training programs (with Implementation Plan):\nThe Center For Entrepreneurship educations is learner-centered, inventive problem-solving to turn \nthoughts into openings that can be changed into substances. This recommendation will contribute in \novercoming the most important obstacle in internationalization, which is the lack of entrepreneurial, \nmanagerial and marketing skills. \n4.9.1 Teachers’ development:\nSet up program guidelines, training programs, and evaluation tools that energize instructors to \nacquire and utilize abilities and behaviors that empower them to function as facilitators and guides \nthem to learning instead of traditional classroom teachers. \n4.9.2  Learners’ Rank expansion:\nMake business education obligatory for all learners in primary and secondary, since its adequacy in \ningrains twenty-first-century abilities and expansion to venture creation skills. \n4.9.3  Content and Pedagogy sharing facilitation:\nMake a clearinghouse of a leading-edge educational module and educational techniques. Excellent \nwork has been drained in this field over the past decade, and numerous institutions are willing to \nshare their academic programs and strategies. \n4.9.4 Instructional methods redesigning:\nRebuild the guidelines measures and classroom standards to advance team-based activity arranged \nto mentor in spaces outlined to improve collaboration and creativity that incorporate genuine world \nintuition with enterprise specialists and target markets for new products and services.  \n5. CONCLUSIONS\nBusinesses that operate solely in a broad market do not guarantee a long-term international market \nplan. Internationalization is a vital necessity for most SMEs in the Qatari Market as it helps gain \nnumerous benefits and motivate the growth of various sectors. Nevertheless, some SMEs face many \nobstacles while trying to develop globally. In most cases, these growing SMEs do not follow the right \npath to overcome these difficulties, and have to surrender and face financial losses. Thus, \ninternationalization can be time-consuming, costly, and overtiring for most SMEs, particularly if \nentrepreneurs face financial obstacles in their local market.\nTherefore, it is exceptionally critical that business owners make the right decisions about accurate \ntime and plan to access external markets.
