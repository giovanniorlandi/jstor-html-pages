Their feet should be kept\ndamp, but not wet. The leaves\nshould be washed twice a week in\ngood soapsuds and rinsed in clear\nwater. When the pot gets too full\nof roots, repot the plant. Every\nTubber plant should have a prepared\nfood square meal twice a month. Give\nIt a dose of diluted ammonia occa\nsionally, too.\nWith regard to the housewife\'s\npotted plants generally, Uncle Sam\nsays she should chase the wooly\nwhite mealy bugs and the little red\nants away from them with a tooth\npick. She may drown the red spider\nwith a squirt gun If the bugs and\nspiders shatter your preparedness\nprogram, you are advised to cut the\nplants oft within an inch of their\nlives- and throw them away. They\'ll\ngrow again\nThe green fly, which is not so green\nas it looks, won\'t bother your plants\nif you keep them well bathed and\nled.\nFIVE YEARS OF\nREVOLUTIONINMEXICO\nFields Are Untillcd or Devastated\nLivestock Confiscated People\nAre Homeless.\nWashington, Nov 22 The\npresent breach between Carranza and\nVilla was opened a year ago, by jeal\nousy rivalry and mistrust Peace\nwas shortlived following Carranza\'s\nentry into Mexico City in August,\n1914 A month later Villa began\nhis revolt against Carranza, who was\nsupported by Genedal Obregon Genl\nAngeles, military rival of Obregon\',\nsided with Villa.\nThe Villa-Carranzh breach wid-j\nened when Villa demanded that Carr\nranza proclaim himself provisional\npresident, according to the "plan of\nGuadalupe," name a cabinet and call\nelections Carranza did not do thisl\nIt would have disqualified him for\nthe presidency.\nConvention Packed.\nThe Aguas Calientes convention\nwas then called to mediate CarT\nranza claimed the convention was\npacked by Villa delegates planning\nWebster\'s\nTovereat,the\nu: 5J\nus^egiD^^rtt^^rnv^haAfcend\n7ats. ^fan,h^ttan4IaMn4rf NBWniWk,\n^on^ains, 27, agnnre^fljUes. if ,are\nfc4|inpd ^/WK^h^w^i&gast, cereal\ntsVRMfVIWr *.4**4Ma*Mn^th-\n.^ed^waln^rtuad^ijover Ji*anhattan\nfee**)*!** pfc W^leefc^avervthlng\n4indjUAjMiprifs^roulAihAbur^ be-\n^ft&erv ^ft*e^^h|nfif ^ou Hease.\n^rjl p^^u*a^4i^atetc?W\nwoul fill a titj^mimW***rh*lt a\ncubic miie_bJg,Jt. it. were set up\nwou]^^Wf weBttm\' 9AWhr*s\nHEway_weeat and\nway we\nwork, isi bound to\n\'make the liver sluggish.\n-Headaches backaches\n"tiredReeling** result.\nThen we\'should "take some*\nthing" to renew intestinal ac-r\ntivity.

W. T.Mason.)\nUnited Press Staff\nCorrespondent.\nBulgaria\'^ army in southern Ser\nbia has dominated the military situa\ntion in the Balkans.\nDespite the concentration of the\nAnglo-French troops in the southern\nSerbian war area, the Bulgars have\nbegun an advance almost to the\nGreek border, for the apparent pur\npose of driving the Serbs into Greece\nand forcing the Greek government to\na decision as to their participation\nin the war.\nDelays apparently are occurring in\nthe dispatch of reinforcements to the\nSecbs. The Anglo-French forces who\nhave landed at Salonikl are exerting\nlittle influence on the Serbian cam\npaign. But in order to prevent the\nBulgar-Teuton representatives from\ndominating the diplomatic situation\nat Athens an embargo has been de\nclared by the two western allies on\nGreek shipping.\nSo long as Greece\'s policy remains\nequivocal, her extensive commerce\nwith Great Britain and France will\nbe obliterated.\nKing Constantine\'s attitude, there\nfore, has become seriously confused\nthis week. There is no doubt that\nhis desire is to act agreeably to Teu\ntonic interests and intern Serbian\ntroops that may be forced to retreat\ninto Greek territory. But if he does\nthis, the major part of his commerce\nmay be tied up.\nThe Italian government granted\npassports last week to German and\nAustro-Hungarian cardinals who de\nsire to attend the consistory which\nPope Benedict has called to meet at\nBorne next month. Churchmen from\nthe other belligerent nations, will be\nin Rome at the time of the conclave,\nand there is little doubt but that an\neffort will be made to bring about\nexchanges of opinions concerning pos\nsible bases of peace.\nNot since the war began has an\nopportunity occurred for eminent men\nof the belligerent countries to meet\nin discussion. At the conclave this\nopportunity will be created. The\ncardinals undoubtedly will be large\nly in the confidence of their govern\nments, for it is inconceivable any na\ntion would fail to take hold of this\nopportunity to assist with informal\nexpression of views that may lead to\npeace.\nIt became known this week that\nGeneral Monro, who succeeded Gen\neral Hamilton in command of the\nDardanelles operations, has advised\nabandonment of the -Gallipoli cam\npaign. There are indications that\nif the Gallopoli peninsula is returned\nto the Turks the effect will be seri\nously depressing in Australia and\nNew Zealand. The two antipodean\ncolonies have regarded the land cam\npaign against Constantinople as their\nespecial contribution to the salvation\nof the British empire. If their sac\nrifices are shown to have been in vain\nbecause of faulty British strategy and\nleadership, eventful changes in the\nmoves of the imperial government\nmay result.\nThe reported capture of Monastir\nby the Bulgarians, whether true or\nnot, probably means serious fighting\nis being pressed by the Bulgars close\nADDITIONAL WAHT ADS\nToo Late To Classify\nWANTEDOdd jobs by Boy Scouts\nto earn money for suits.

Should the Serbs be forced\nto take refuge in Greece, that fact\ncannot contribute to the support of\nthose who are arguing at Athens\nagainst a Teutonic victory. Partic\nularly is this true because the Anglo\nFrench forces in the Balkans are con\ncentrating in southern Serbia.\nThe sorry plight of the Serbs em\nphasizes the pro-German belief at\nAthens that the Teutonic powers are\nfar ahead in the war. Yet, if Greece\ninterns the retreating Serbs, her\nlarge overseas commerce may be\nwholly ruined by the French and\nBritish navies\nIt is to Bulgaria\'s interest to force-),\nthe issue at this time, while the An\nglo-French troops in the Balkans are\nso meager.\nThis, therefore, is the reason why\nthe fighting in southern Serbia and\nthe fate of Monastir possess such\nimportance.\nFOB SALE.\nA carload of horses at M. & I.\nyard, Wednesday.
