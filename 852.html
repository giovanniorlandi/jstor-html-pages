Not alone to its read\ners, but to every soul in Las Vegas we give our best\nwishes for a happier year, and for that prosperity\nwithout which happiness cannot be complete.\nThe people of Las Vegas are most fortunate in\nhaving a future of assured prosperity ahead of them.\nThere is no place in the whole West holding out the\npromise which Las Vegas does for renewed and in\ncreased prosperity in every line of business.\nOur cheap electric current brings us heat, light\nand power at a cost less than any other comparable\ncity can boast, adding immeasurably to the health,\ncomfort and pleasure of our people. Soon it will bring\nto us new enterprises and large payrolls to enrich our\nfinancial stream.\nTravelers are gradually from year to year increas\ning in number. The year 1939 will bring to us more\nthousands of visitors than ever before and with them\nnew means of accommodation and entertainment will\nbe created.\nWith these and many other things in mind, The\nAge with confidence wishes and predicts for the\npeople of Las Vegas a New Year full of happiness and\nprosperity.\nMrs. Perdue Is\nVisiting Here\n—■ - ■■\nMrs. Perdue, of Los Angeles, the\ndaughter of Mrs. Clint Boggs, re\nturned with her mother Monday last\nto spend some time at the Boggs\nhome.\nMrs. Perdue, who is remembered\nas Jean Fayle, has been in rather\npoor health recently because of a\nrecurrence of an old heart trouble.\nShe hopes that Las Vegas climate\nand the care of her mother may\nrestore her soon to better health.\nMrs. Squires To\nVisit In North\nMr. and Mrs. C .P. Squires spent\nthe Christmas holiday at the home\nof Mr. and Mrs. C. C. Boyer, in Ely,\nNevada. Mr. Squires returned to\nVegas Tuesday, while Mrs. Squires\nremains in Ely for the remainder of\nthe week.\nOn New Year’s, Herbert Squires,\nhighway engineer in charge of a\nhighway contract on the Victory\nhighway, will go to Ely and take\nhis mother with him to spend a\nweek or two in Winnemucca.\nGovernor To Be\nMaster of Lodge\nThe installation of Governor-Elect\nHarold E. Stassen as Master of\nShekinah Lodge No. 171, A. F. &\nA. M., St. Paul, Minn., is planned to\ntake place January 14, 1939, after\nhe has taken office as governor of\nthe state. As far as is known no\nother Minnesota governor has ever\nbeen inducted into office as Master\nof his lodge. The question is raised\nwhether a governor of any other\n[state became master of his lodge\nduring his term of office.\nIsabelle Squires\nIn Los Angeles\nMr. and Mrs. James W. Squires\nwent to Los Angeles Saturday last\nand spent the Christmas holidays\nwith Mrs. Wortman, mother of Mrs.\nSquires, and Mr. and Mrs. C. Russell\nSquires.\nMr. Squires returned to Vegas\nMonday and plans to drive to Los\nAngeles again this week-end to\nbring Mrs. Squires home.\nBob Ritter Is\nFund CoDector\nBob Ritter was appointed head of\nthe committee charged with the\nduty of collecting a fund of $5,000\nfor publicity purposes, by the Las\nVegas Chamber of Commerce at its\nmeeting Tuesday noon.\nA tentative schedule was worked\nout which contemplates collections\nfrom the business elements of Las\nVegas as follows: $1,250 from the\nwholesalers, $1,000 from the retail\ndealers; $1,000 from hotels and auto\ncourts; $1,750 from clubs and tav\nerns. The fund is designed to pro\nvide necessary folders advertising\nthe recreational and business ad\nvantages offered by the city, high\nway signs, windshield stickers, and\na large number of similar activities\nduring the coming year.\nThe Chamber of Commerce has,\nduring its existence, attracted many\nthousands of people to the city and,\nbeen also largely instrumental in\naccomplishing the things upon\nwhich Las Vegas depends for its\nlivelihood. It is reasonable to be\nlieve that every dollar expended in\nChamber of Commerce activities\nduring the past 25 years has\nbrought a return of hundreds to the\nbusiness channels of the city.\nIt is the belief of those who are\nactive in community activities\nthrough the Chamber that business\nmen will respond generously to th*\nappeal for funds necessary to bring\ncontinued prosperity to this favored\nsection.\nSanta Claus Is\nComing To Town\n“Santa Claus" is the name of a\nnew town being created on U. S.\nHighway No. 93 at a point about\nsixteen miles this side of Kingman,\naccording to a report received in <\nVegas.\nThe promoter of the enterprise is\nsaid to be the former Nina Hudson,\nprominent real estate operator of\nLos Angeles and Hollywood. It is\nher idea to attract prominent peo\nple to that desert area and already\nit is reported that Joel McCrea and\nother Hollywood celebrities have\npurchased acreage adjoining Santa\nClaus.\nA permit for the establishment of\na postoffice named Santa Claus at\nthe location has already been issued,\nit is stated. It is hoped that the\nestablishment of a toy factory and\nother similar enterprises in keeping\nwith the character of Santa Claus\nmay be brought about.', 'Death Valley’s\nDoin’s Related\nBy THE RAMBLER\nDEATH VALLEY JUNCTION, Cal.,\nDecember 26 — Mr. and Mrs. Vern\nard Davis, of Sacramento, are pass\ning the holidays as guests in the\nhome of Mrs. Davis’ parents, Mr.\nand Mrs. Owen Montgomery. Mrs.\nDavis will be remembered here as\nthe former Miss Frances Montgom\nery. Mr. Davis is with the Pacific\nGas & Electric company, located at\nSacramento.\ne o o\nMiss Mary Lillian Gower, fresh\nman at U. S. C., in Los Angeles, is\npassing the holiday vacation with\nher parents, Mr. and Mrs. H. P.\nGower, in their Death Valley Junc\ntion home.\no o o\nBill Walsh, machinist at the\nT. & T. railroad shops, is now the\nhead of a Death Valley Junction\nfamily. Mr. Walsh removed his fam\nily, consisting of Mrs. Walsh and\nthree children, from San Bernar\ndino to the Junction during the\npast week.\nMr. and Mrs. Roy Himes (nee\nMiss Doris Greene) visited Christ\nmas day in the home of Mrs. Himes*\nparents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles\nGreene, at Death Valley Junction.\nThey were accompanied by their\nyoung son, and returned to their\nRiverside home on Monday.\no o o\nMrs. James O’Connell was called\nto Barstow early last week by the\nillness of her sister, Mrs. Fred\nClooney, who was threatened with\npneumonia. Mrs. O’Connell returned\nhome on Thursday and reported\n“Mrs. Clooney improved.\no o o\nMr. Benjamin S. Horton, veteran\nroadmaster of the T. & T. railroad\nlocated at Death Valley Junction,\ndeparted last Saturday for a week’s\nholiday visit in the families of his\nson and daughter, near San Bernar\ndino. Mr. Horton first entered San\nBernardino nearly 70 years ago —\nin 1869 — accompanying his parents\nand elder brother, Sidney Horton.\nThe latter is still a resident on a\nranch east of San Bernardino.\no o o\nMr. Charles Kreidler, employed by\nthe Di Giorgio Fruit Farms com\npany at Arvin, near Bakersfield, is\nvisiting old-time friends in the\nDeath Valley and Shoshone dis\ntricts. Mr. Kreidler was injured two\nyears ago, on Christmas eve, while\nmaking the ascent to Dante’s View,\nhis automobile going into the ditch.\nHe was layed up in the Emergency\nhospital for a couple of weeks, but\nsays he enjoys revisiting the scenes\nin and about the valley. Mr. Kreid\nler reports the present as a quiet\nperiod on the big fruit farms, but\nthat early in the year several hun\ndred additional employes will be\nadded, until in the peak summer\nseason a total of around 1500 to 1800\npersons will be employed. He states\nthat about 1800 carloads of fruit are\nshipped out from the farm annually.\no o o\nDuring the past week the Death\nValley and also the Junction dis\ntrict have received the greatest\nprecipitation of rain since the big\nstorm which did so much damage\nlast March. At intervals for several\ndays and nights a slow, steady rain\nfell. The Amargosa river, which\nmost of the time is simply a dry\nbed, has been overflowing its banks\nfor the past few days; This has\nnecessitated routing travelers over\nthe old detour known as Dead\nMan’s Pass, as the swollen stream\nflows over the highway in eight or\nnine places between here and Sho\nshone. However, Saturday was a\nbeautiful day, with cooler tempera\nture and clear skies, which will\nsoon check the flow and permit\npassage over the regular route.\no o o\nIn the absence of the regular\npriest, Father J. J. Crowley, who\nwas occupied with his duties at his\nparish at Lone Pine Catholic, ser\nvices were conducted at midnight\nChristmas eve in Corkill Hall by\nthe Rev. Father Watson, of Loyola\nuniversity, Los Angeles.\no o o\nBill Huston and family came out\nlast Saturday and spent Christmas\nwith Mr. Huston’s parents, Mr. and\nMrs. Will Huston, at Death Valley\nJunction. Mr. Huston, Jr., who for\nmerly lived at Death Valley Junc\ntion, now operates a ranch, includ\ning a large apiary near Corona,\nCalif.\nWWW\nMiss Ruth George visited her par\nents, Mr. and Mrs. Mickey Devine,\nand her many friends here over\nChristmas. Miss Ruth is now oper\nating a beauty parlor in Riverside.\no o o\nThe Rambler was informed early\nMonday morning that the highway\nsouth of Death Valley Junction\nwhich has been flooded and over\nflown by the Amargosa river, re\nsulting from the recent heavy rains\nin the Nevada mountains, was\nopened up to traffic Sunday after\nnoon so that travelers can now\ndrive through from Los Angeles,\nBarstow and other southern points\nwithout making any detour. As a\nresult a large number of tourists\ncame in late Sunday evening and\nSunday night. The highway forces\nhave been faithfully working over\ntime in repairing damage and wash\nouts between here and Shoshone.\nThe local forces were augmented by\nMr. Dwight Wannatott, division\nsuperintendent, who came over from\nBishop, and remained at the work\nuntil the highway was opened up.\nHe left for home late Sunday night.\no o o\nJudge William Dehy, judge of the\nInyo County Superior court, of In\ndependence, and his brother John\nDehy, of Bishop, passed through the\nvalley last Friday and were regis\ntered at Hotel Amargosa Friday\nnight. They left early Saturday\nmorning for Las Vegas, and thence\nto the big Boulder dam for their\nfirst sight and inspection of that\nwonderful work. They then pro\nceeded to Kingman, Ariz., where\nJohn boarded the train destined for\nPhoenix, where he plans to pass the\nwinter months. Judge Dehy on his\nreturn passed through Death Valley\nJunction Sunday night.\no o o\nSenator-Elect and Mrs. Charles\nBrown, of Shoshone, are preparing\nto leave early in the new year for\nSacramento, where Mr. Brown will\nsit as one of the Democratic mem\nbers of the upper house of the Cali\nfornia state legislature. At the re\ncent November election there were\n22 Democratic and 20 Republican\nstate senators elected. This majority\nwas reduced to 21 by the recent\naccidental injury and subsequent\ndeath of Senator-Elect McColl, who\nwas elected from one of the north\nern senatorial districts. McColl was\ninjured in an automobile collision\nOn Cajon Pass in a heavy rainstorm\nlast week, and passed away a short\ntime later in a San Bernardino hos\npital. In connection with Senator\nElect Brown’s vote at the recent\nelection, It Is interesting to note\nthat he received nearly as many\nvo es as both candidates for gover\nnor— Olson and Merriam! Olson\nreceived, in the county, 1,184; Mer\nriam, 1,450, and Brown, 2,433!\nAnother interesting feature of Mr.\nBrown’s election was that, while\nstrictly temperate in all things, he\nis not and did not claim to be a\nprohibitionist, not a teetotaler. So\nwhile he placed his name on both\nthe Democratic and Republican\ntickets in the primary, he did not\nplace his name on the prohibition\nticket, thus practicing duplicity and\ndeception (as many candidates diS,\nregarding “ham and eggs,” “Town\nsend,” etc., in trying to “catch” a\nfew unwary, unfair votes among us\nold simpletons with one foot in the\ngrave”). Even so, a number of “pro\nhibition” voters wrote Mr. Brown’s\nname in on that ticket at tne pri\nmary, thus making him the nominee\nof that party! So Mr. Brown re\nceived the nomination for state\nsenator from Mono and Inyo coun\nties on three tickets — one of them\nwithout his solicitation — and was\nelected as a Democrat at the No\nvember 8 election by the largest\nvote of any candidate on the ticket.\nMAKE A NOTE OP IT\nLiving at today’s fast pace,\n.houghts, impressions, observations,\nideas, crowd upon us witfr such\nspeed that unless we do develop the\nhabit of making notes, ideas of\ngreat potential value are likely to\nescape or be smothered.

S. 93, Can\nada to Mexico, to give it the full\ntitle to which it is entitled, has\nbeen handed a gorgeous New Year’s\ngif. by the sovereign state of Ne\nvada and Robert A. Allen, Nevada’s\nstate highway engineer. Last week\nthe state highway department\nopened, and now has under consid\neration, bids for construction of two\nimportant sectors of the Four States\nroute in that state. One of these is\nfor rebuilding and repaving 13\nmiles of highway between Apex and\nCrystal, a short distance north of\nLas Vegas. The other bid covers\nnew construction 15 miles in length\nnorth of Searchlight, Clark county,\nNevada, which will bring the paving\nto within a mile of that historic\nmining town. When this latter con\ntract is let and the work completed,\nthere will then be only a 20-mile\nsegment of the Four States route in\nNevada yet to be constructed, being\nthe lone gap from Searchlight\nsouthward to the California state\nline.\nIn California all the road is paved\nfor several hundred miles south un\ntil a gap now being constructed is\nreached between Desert Cen er and\nNiland, which work will be finished\nwithin the next two months, and is\nbeing rushed so that Four States\ndirectors and members attending\nthe midwinter convention of the\nassociation at Brawley in March\ncan travel over this new stretch of\nroad and through scenic Graham\nPass in the Chuckawalja mountains.\nIn this way those from the northern\nstates who attend the convention\nwill have the satisfaction of travel\ning over the virtually completed\nroute from the Canadian boundary\nto the Mexican border.\nFurther upstream on the Colo\nrado river, and likewise along the\nroute of the Four States highway,\nan appropriation will be sought at\nthe coming session of congress, in\nconnection with the general streng\nthening of west coast defenses, to\nestablish a United States navy air\nbase at Lake Meade. A survey was\nrecently completed by Nevada’s\ncongressman, James C. Scrugham,\nand an investigating committee,\nwhich proposed a huge naval base\non the world’s largest artificial\nlake back of Boulder dam. The\nmove is part of a plan for estab\nlishing a series of military and\nnaval landing fields about 250 miles\nfrom the coast, extending from the\nCanadian boundary to the Mexican\nborder. Such a system would be\nconsidered a secondary line of de\nfense and in military quarters at\nWashington there has been consid\nerable discussion about placing the\nInternational Four States highway\nunder federal jurisdiction as a mili\ntary traffic artery.\nApparently this straight, short,\ndirect route from the Canadian\nboundary line to the Mexican bor\nder has attracted the earnest atten\ntion of the army and navy de\npartments, and evidently they are\nappreciating its strategic value as a\npart of the coast defense plan. This\ninterest on the pact of Washington\nis likely to be reflected in increased\nfederal allotments for the road,\nwhich carries the federal designa\ntion U. S. 93 over most of its\nmileage.\nDirectors of the highway associ\nThe Tennessee Bubble\nBy GUS W. DYER\nProfessor of Economic* and Sociology, Vanderbilt University\nWill the TVA turn out to be a third\ngreat economic “Bubble”? The South\nSea Bubble and the Mississippi Bub\nble of the 18th century are familiar to\nthose who\nknow economic\nhistory.\nThe inconsis\ntencies of the\nTV A will make\nit difficult for\nhistorians to\ninterpret it\nThe sole pur\npose of the\nTennessee Val\nley enterprise,\nes stated in the\nlaw under\nwhich it was\npromoted, is to\nimprove navi\ngation and pro\nvide means for flood control in the\nTennessee Valley. Since the President\nand members of Congress are bound\nunder oath to uphold the Constitu\ntion, and act in good faith in direct\ning the policies of the government\nunder the Constitution, it must be as\nsumed that the purposes stated in the\nlaw are the real purposes of the\nmovement. But such an assumption\ncreates great confusion. For there is\nno legitimate demand for the expen\nditure of any large sum of money at\nthe present time, either for the im\nprovement of river navigation or for\nflood control in this part of our coun\ntry.\nRiver transportation has been prac\ntically abandoned and the occasional\noverflows of the streams that gener\nally come when the crops are not on\nthe land can hardly be considered a\npressing problem. Since it is claimed\nthat the dams built by the TVA will\nput under water permanently more\nland than was ever subject to occa\nsional overflows, the flood control ob\njective wanes. Pojver dams don’t pre\nvent floods; they create permanent\nfloods.\nation expressed themselves as ex\nceedingly gratified at the attention\nshown the Four States highway,\nand the recognition which it is re\nceiving in Washington as a military\nroad, thus insuring a continuance\nof federal interest and government\nappropriations for construction or\nfor improving of the roadway.\nTOUGH MINDS, TOUGH BODIES\nWe know that leading nations of\n1960 will be managed by men and\nwomen who have lived a tough life.\nAll will be toughs. Not the kind of\ntoughs who hang around corners\nand snatch purses. No. The greater\ntoughs. - The greater toughs are\nthose who have toughened them\nselves from childhood onward — re\nlentlessly, coolly, steadily, patiently.\n— Walter B. Pitkin in the Rotarian\nmagazine.\nNervous, Weak,\nAnkles Swollen!\nMuch nervousness is caused by an ex\ncess of acids and poisons due to func\ntional Kidney and Bladder disorders\nwhich may also cause Getting Up\nNights, Burning Passages, Swollen\nJoints, Backache, Circles Under Eyes,\nExcess Acidity, Leg Pains and Dizzi\nness. Help your kidneys purify your\nblood with Cystex. Usually the very\nfirst dose starts helping your kidneys\nclean out excess acids and this soon may\nmake you feel like new. Cystex must\nsatisfy you completely or money back is\nguaranteed. Get Cystex (siss-tex) to\nday. It costs only 3c a dose at druggists\nand the guarantee protects you.\nNotwithstanding the above facts,\nand notwithstanding the growing tax\nrate, and the rapid increase in the\nnational debt, the Administration is\nsinking an investment of $510,000,000\nin the Tennessee Valley to improve\nriver navigation for which there is no\ndemand, and control occasional floods\nby creating permanent floods.\nWhen we turn from the stated ob\njective of the TV A, and from the au\nthority given those directing the\nmovement, we discover activities that\nare startling in their nature, because\nthey seem to have no connection with\nthe purposes and objectives stated in\nthe law. According to an estimate\nmade by a competent authority, the\namount allotted to flood control is\n$81,133,600, to navigation, $91,800,000,\nand to power production, $332,296,927.\nPower production as an objective\nisn\'t even mentioned in the law.\nWhatever the explanation may be\nthe facts prove that the production\nand sale of electricity is the chief\npurpose of those in charge of the half\nbillion dollar enterprise. The hope of\nreconciling the real purpose of the\nTVA with the purpose stated in the\nlaw under which it operates seems to\nbe based on the assumption that the\nmembers of the Supreme Court are\nmore ignorant and have less knowl\nedge of what is going on than the\naverage man in the street. If the law\nyers are successful in this, a guardian\nwill have to be appointed for the\n“Nine Old Men.” When we turn from\nthe political and ethical aspects of the\nmovement to economic consideration\nwe find conditions that should be in\nteresting to taxpayers. According to\nan estimate made by Dean Moreland,\nthe annual deficit of the TVA in its\nsale of power will be $10,352,000. If\nadditional fixed charges and taxes\nthat a utility company would have to\npay are added, the annual deficit will\nbe $20,999,000. This means that tax\npayers throughout the country must\npay this annual deficit to prevent the\nTVA Bubble from exploding.\n1b center of LOS ANGCLIS\nnewness ona social ocTiwy\n• •.

SQUIRES\nChristmas in Ely\nFor three successive years we\nhave had the pleasure of spending\nthe Christmas holiday in the great\ncopper camp of El.y. Of course each\ntime it has meant a “white Christ\nmas” because Ely is more than\nthree hundred miles directly north\nof Las Vegas and at an altitude of\napproximately six thousand feet,\nboth of which differences mean de\ncisive changes in climate.\nFrom Las Vegas, traveling north\nover Highway No. 93, one sees a\ngradual change in climate within\nthe five or six hours required for\nthe trip. The storms of a week ago\ndid not hit that more northerly re\ngion as strongly as Las Vegas and\nsouthern California, and snow was\nbut a few inches deep in those\nplaces where it still remained on\nthe ground. In the high country\nabout Pioche there is a thin film of\nsnow on the pavement and a little\nmore on the ten-mile curving road\nthrough Connor’s Pass, but the\nstreets are clear in Ely, although\nslippery where the snow has melted\nand frozen again.\nIn the matter of climate, we\nfound a temperature of five degrees\nbelow zero the first night we were\nin Ely, yet suffered no inconven\nience for the reason that every\nhouse has provision for heating and\nis kept warm night and day. Cars\nare all equipped with heaters so\nthat when we went here and there\nwe were reasonably comfortable.\nAnd people generally wear warmer\nclothing than we do in Vegas.\nSki Tournament *\nIn Ely we found much enthusi\nasm among young people over ski\ning. There are several places near\nthe city where there are suitable\nplaces for the sport and one of the\nruns is to be equipped with means\nfor drawing the skiers to the top\nof the hill.\nI was told that the group of Ely\nski enthusiasts is anxious that Las\nVegas stage a ski tournament in\nthe Charleston mountains this win\nter and that they plan to come here\nto compete if such an event is held.\nI am sure it would be well worth\nwhile as a matter of community\nenterprise to hold a ski tournament\nhere if there is sufficient snow to\nmake it feasible. Las Vegas has a\nvast resource in its mountain areas\nand should promote knowledge of\nit vigorously.\nCongenial People\nThe people of Ely have in a large\ndegree the characteristics found in\nall great mining centers of the\nWest. They are friendly, generous\nand public-spirited.

It is im\npossible to announce a list of “10\nbest books” of any year, says Wil\nliam Lyon Phelps, author and long\ntime professor of literature at Yale\nuniversity. “But,” he continues, “it\nis not difficult to make a brief\ncatalogue of favorites.” He presents\nhis selections in the January issue\nof the Rotarian magazine, in which\nhe conducts a regular book-review\nsection.\n“Billy” Phelps, as he is widely\nknown, especially at Yale, has read\n10,000 different books and still aver\nages 250 a year though he has “re\ntired.” According to a biographer in\na recent issue of Life magazine, “he\nhas probably done more than any\nliving figure to inculcate the Amer\nican mind with a reverence for the\nwritten and spoken word.”\nHere’s his 1938 list of favorites in\nThe Rotarian:\nFiction — “Testament,” by R.

TT P DC TO THE\nL Hi 1 lCilVO EDITOR\nDear Charlie:\nLas Vegas is different — haven’t\nI been trying to put that over to\nyou ever since I’ve been here? The\nSpirit of the Old West simply won’t\ngive up and limp out. Listen to this:\nMaybe it isn’t etiquette to take a\nhorse into a cocktail room any\nwhere on earth, but it’s all right\nhere. The other night a friend of\nmine loaned me a little mare for a\ncouple of hours. We hoofed it up\nMain street (the little mare ard\nme), taking in the moonlight and\nhaving a swell time, and then I felt\nthirsty and stopped at the Apache\nbar. I tied the gal to a telephone\npole and went in fox my drink.\nWhile I was imbibing, and attend\ning to my own business, Bob Rus\nsell, the manager of the Apache\nhotel, brought my mount right into\nthe place. Guess he didn’t have\nmuch trouble getting her in, but I\nwas fairly knocked off my stool,\n’cause I was the only one there that\nknew that when Gypsy Girl finds\nherself in tight places she starts\nthrowing out her hind legs and do\ning a wing-dog and she doesn’t\ncare what happens.\nWell, anyway, Bob decided to\nshow that horse something that she\nhadn’t seen before, and to show the\nguests something that they hadn’t\nseen before, and I held my breath.\nYou should have seen the looks\non the faces of the people sitting\nin the cocktail room, as he led her\nright in among them. Was she a\nlady? Nothing like it. Everybody\nstared but the old-timers. They\ndidn’t even look up. Then he took\nher into the casino; but as some\nguy was cleaning up on roulet e,\nshe didn’t get much attention from\nthat direction. Gypsy was more in\nterested in the crap table. I could\ntell by looking at her ears, laying\nback) kind of flat, that she wanted\nto scram out of there. She was get\nting jittery. We started to take her\nout to the kitchen but she balked\nat that, as the door was too little.\nThen she stood just long enough to\nrun the colonel in debt to the\ncleaners. I guess everyone got a\nkick out of the horse-play but the\nporter. I can still see the expression\non his face, called upon to do some\nthing out of “line of duty.”\nEveryone wants to do something\nwild and crazy and silly at some\ntime in their life. Maybe the colonel\nalways wanted to take a horse into\na cocktail room. Maybe he does it\nregularly, I don’t know, but when I\ngot home I started some thinking\nof my own, and wished I wasn’t so\nconventional. I’d like to satisfy\nsome of the urges that come to me\nsometime; like kicking a porter in\nthe seat of the pants as he’s leaning\nout saying “All aboard,’’ or shoving\nmy feec up on the seat in front of\nme at the picture show, or telling\na lot of hot-shots what I think of\nthem to their faces, without being\ndisfigured for life. But being a\ntimid soul, I think I had better stick\nto the straight and narrow, and let\nfellows like Colonel Russell do the\nclowning. I’m leaving Las Vegas to\nnight, and I’ll write you from the\nnext stop; but, believe me, I hate to\nleave, for if ever one wants origi\nnality and a kick, this is the place\nto find it.\nBe good.\nDinny Devro.\nP.

Miles of swift-running belting,\ndriven by great motors, make this\nrecord-breaking feat possible.\nMore than 10,000,000 cubic yards\nof sand and gravel have already\nbeen taken out of the pit, and more\nthan 10,000,000 tons of it are al\nready in the dam; and the job is\nnot half done.\nWhen the Bureau of Reclamation\nundertook to build a dam which\nwill be greater in volume than\nwould be possible if every man,\nwoman and child in the United\nStates should place a rock Just as\nbig as himself on a mound, the\nproblem of finding and moving to\nthe site 11,000,000 cubic yards of\ngood sand and gravel confronted its\nengineers.\nHigh above the river, a mile and\na half downstream, underlying a\nsmall precarious patch of dry farm\nland, they discovered a deposit of\nsand and gravel laid down there\nthousands of years ago by a glacial\nstream which flowed into the lake\nformed in the canyon of the Colum\nbia river when the Cordilleran ice\ncap came down from the north and\nblocked the channel. From thou\nsands of square miles of the north\ncountry, the glacier gathered and\nbrought to this spot the smooth\nworn particles of natural rock that\nworkmen now are casting into the\nbiggest piece of ariificial stone in\nthe world.\nDay and night, electric shovels\nwith buckets of eight cubic yard\ncapacity move the sand and gravel\nfrom the bank to belt conveyors or\nhuge trucks, which deliver them to\na crushing plant, where boulders\ndropped ages ago from floating ice\nbergs are broken down to a maxi\nmum size of six inches. Washing\nfacilities carry away fine glacial\nsilt, and screens and classifiers sort\nout three sizes of sand, later blend\ned in proper proportions, and four\nsizes of gravel.\nAccording to the exacting stand\nards set up for the concrete for the\nGrand Coulee dam, nature overdid\nthe crushing and grinding that pro\nduced the sand and gravel deposit,\nproviding sand to the extent of 65\nper cent, while only 28 per cent of\nthe aggregate in the dam can be\nsand. As a consequence, a small\nmountain of several million yards\nof waste sand has been built up\nnear the screening plant. Crushing\nthe boulders which were dropped at\nthe mouth of the prehistoric stream\nby icebergs increases the gravel\noutput of the pit and reduces the\nwasting of sand.\nWater for the washing of the\naggregate is pumped up to the\nplant from the river against a head\nof 670 feet. Being on that account\ntoo valuable to run to waste, two\nlarge clarifiers were installed near\nthe screening plant. One is a circu\nlar concrete pond, 125 feet in diam\neter, and the other is 250 feet long\nand 125 feet wide, with rounded\nends. In them, fine material settles\nto the bottom and is drawn off at\nthe center, while clear water over\nflows the rims of the bowls, to be\nused again in the screening and\nwashing plant. Water circulates\nthrough the plant at the rate of\n20,000 gallons a minute, enough\npassing in a single day to serve the\ndomestic requirements of a city of\nnearly 200,000 persons.\nOver the longest single belt con\nveyor in the world, a workman\nposted a mile away, by remote con\ntrol causes sand or any one of the\nfour sizes of gravel to flow from\nthe sizing plant to the stock piles\nnear the dam. In making the 10,000\nfoot piece of belting, 80 tons of\ncotton and rubber were used. The\nbelt was made in eastern plants in\neight ten-ton sections and vulcan\nized into an endless band on the Job.\nIt is four feet wide, and runs at a\nspeed of 450 feet per minute. At\nmaximum capacity, it can move in\na single day the equivalent of\nnearly 1,000 carloads of freight.\nTURKEY BONE BRINGS\nDEATH TO ABORIGINAL\nBRISBANE, Australia — A case of\n"pointing the bone," which caused\nthe death of an aboriginal named\nMajor, aged 40, was reported to\nMount Isa police recently.\nThe bone was pointed at Major\nduring a dispute with a fellow\ntribesman.

Richard Kirman expressed his\ndesire that all motorists throughout\nthis state be particularly careful\nduring the holiday season.\n“It is during this happy period\nthat we must concentrate our at\ntention on carefulness in driving,\nboth through the streets crowded\nwith holiday shoppers and on the\nopen highways. This is the time of\nyear when good feeling toward our\nfellow men is expressed in its\ngreatest degree, and it is up to all\nof us in exemplifying this feeling\nto take particular care in assuring\nthe safety of our friends, neighbors,\nand family,” the governor said.\nKirman’s statement was heartily\nendorsed by the safety division of\nthe Nevada state highway depart\nment which has been pressing a\ncampaign during the past 12 months\nto reduce automobile and pedestrian\naccidents throughout the state of\nNevada. The safety division warned\nmotorists that this time of year is\nparticularly hazardous on the open\nhighways where icy stretches are\nfrequently encountered, and sug\ngested that all motorists taking\nlong trips be extremely careful dur\ning the early morning and after\nsundown since it is at these limes\nthat the otherwise safe roadways\nare frequently found to be icy.\n• •\nAlthough fewer turkeys were pro\nduced in Nevada this year than for\nsome time, the season has been an\nencouraging one for the turkey\ngrowers in the sta e, L. E. Cline of\nthe University of Nevada agricul\ntural extension service said this\nweek.\nCost of production, loss from dis\nease, and market conditions have\nbeen comparatively favorable, he\ndeclared in discussing the season.\n“Contrary to predictions, for the\ncountry as a whole, early in the\nyear, the large anticipated supply\nof the birds for the holiday season\ndid not materialize, with a result\ning good demand," Cline said.\n“The storage supply of turkeys,\nneeded to furnish birds between\nmarketing, was 10 per cent under\nthat of a year before, and helped\nto strengthen the market. Smaller\nstorage prevailed, too, throughout\nthe year.”\nPrices this year, both at Thanks\ngiving and Christmas, were above\nthose of a year ago, and they\nstrengthened materially as the sea\nson advanced, the extension man\npointed\' out.\nSelling of Nevada turkeys under\ngovernment grade again this year\nbrought a higher price for the Ne\nvada holiday fowl. On the San\nFrancisco market, the government\ngrade, box-packed turkeys brought\nwholesale from one and one-half to\ntwo cents a pound more than the\nother birds.\nThe number of turkeys produced\nthis year in Nevada, however, Cline\nsaid, was considerably under that of\nrecent years, with the result that\nmany Pacific coast customers who\nhave been depending upon Nevada\ngrown turkeys for their holiday\ntables had to look, elsewhere.\nHigh prices for concentrated feed\nfor two years prior to 1938 were\nblamed by Cline for the reduction In\nthe number of turkeys produced in\nthe state this year. The feed cost of\nproduction this year, he said, was\nconsidered favorable.\nWith the outlook much more en\ncouraging, Cline anticipates a re\nturn to normal turkey production\nin Nevada next year.\n“Nevada’s irrigated farms are well\nadapted to turkey raising,” he said,\nand Nevada growers have a reputa\ntion for producing a high quality\nproduct.\n"The Nevada turkey output can\nbe increased many times without\naffecting the general supply or the\nreturns to Nevada growers. Turkey\nproduction in Nevada also helps\nsupply a home market for the grain\ncrops of the state, which are in\ncreasing each year, and in addition\nit provides employment at home for\nlabor that usually cannot be turned\ninto cash in any other way.”\nMISS PERKINS OPPOSES\nThe announcement by Secretary\nof Labor Perkins that she is op\nposed to any amendments to the\nWagner Labor Act is construed in\nWashington as an expression of the\nattitude of the administration, and\nnot entirely her own opinion, in\nwhich she disagrees with demands\nfor improving the act so that it will\nbe fair, equally to employers and\nemployes.

These gems, many of which\nhave been voluntarily contributed,\nwill be lent to the commissioners of\nthe New York World’s Fair and San\nFrancisco Exposition to represent\nthe precious stones mined in all sec\ntions of the state and reached by a\nnetwork of hard-surfaced highways.\nTurquoise, amethyst, lapis lazuli,\nopal, crystal, agate, and wonder\nstones, together with many other\nnative gems have been cut, highly\npolished, and arranged artistically\non glass shelves in the mahogany,\ncabinet. The cabinet is indirectly\nlighted at the top and has two large\nglass • doors through which the\nstones can be viewed.\nOn the first shelf, large specimens\nof rose and cream wonder stone,\nmined in Eureka and Churchill\ncounties, gleam brightly under the\nlights, which also enhance pyra\nmidieal shapes of green and white\nagate. Other large agate specimens,\nranging from warm creamy brown\nto black and white, are cut in dif\nferent shapes and sizes. Agates of\ngreat .variety are commonly found\nhroughout the state. E’ko, Lyon,\nEsmeralda, Pershing and Humboldt\ncounties produce beautiful ringed\nspecimens. Moss agates come from\nWashoe, Elko, and Lyon counties.\nBloodstones, crystals, aladdinite,\nagates, and amethysts are arranged\nwith fine* precision on the second\nshelf. The plan of desigr> is to show\non© or more pieces of the stone in\nthe rough before it is cut into var\nious shapes for mounting.\nNine bloodstones, cut oblong and\noval, take up one corner of the sec\nond shelf. The bloodstone is a green\njasper with fine red spots, and is\none of the most prized of the an\ncient gem stones. According to tra\ndition, this stone originated at the\ncrucifixion of Christ from drops of\nblood, drawn by the spear of a\nrtoman soldier tnrust into nis siue,\nwhich fell on a piece of dark green\njasper. Some beautiful specimens\nare found in Lyon county.\nAgates, formed into pendant, oval,\nround, oblong, and long oval shapes\nradiate from two large rough but\nhighly polished pieces. These are*\nwhite, grayish brown, red, blue,\npink, green, and black in color.\nSix "transparent quartz crystals\nhave been placed on a triangular\nmirror in the center of the second\nshelf. Most of the quartz is mined\nat Crystal Peak ’and also in Hum\nboldt and Pershing counties. Four\nclear specimens are hexagonal in\nshape and have antimony mineral\nor stibnite needles inside of them.\nPershing county produces most of\nthe stibnite variety.\nIn oval, pendant and oblong\nshapes, 16 pieces of aladdinite cast\na veritable rainbow of red, green,\nand tan color alongside of a large\ncluster of amethyst crystals, two\nconcentrated amethyst blocks, and\none finished stone, which add the\nviolet hues to the display.\nThe middle shelf of the cabinet is\ndevoted entirely to native turquoise\ngathered from all parts of the state.\nFrom the very palest blue and green\nto almost royal, these lovely stones,\noften containing considerable matrix\nor foreign material, are grouped\nwith a keen sense of order and\narrangement with regard to the\nlarger, rough samples, and the\nsmaller, finished stones. Turquoise\nhas been mined extensively on a\ncommercial scale throughout Ne\nvada, and especially in the southern\nand central parts of the state. The\nNevada turquoise has a distinct\ntranslucent appearance when cut\nvery thin, and is considered su\nperior to the Persian stones.\nDeep bluish green amazonite from\nNye and Leon counties; light green\nvariscite; cinnabar red myrickite,\nmined in Nye county and cut in\nblocks, small ovals, and table cut\nsquares; petrified wood in thin pol\nished slabs of cream, brown and\nblack, found in nearly every county\nin the state and almost all opalized;\nrhodonite, a faded brick-color ma\nterial beautifully splashed with\nblack and produced in Humboldt\ncounty; and blue lapis lazuli show\ning white matrix can be observed by\nthe gem lover on the fourth shelf\nof the cabinet.\nNatural specimens, of milk, fire,\nand black opals and opalized wood,\nvery rough in appearance but cast\ning forth rays of red and green fire\nfrom various angles, complete the\ncollection of Nevada gems.\nThe opal is one stone that em\nbodies the colors of many gems, and\nthe specimens range in color from\ndeep black to almost transparent\nwhite, showing considerable varia\ntion in fire and effect.\nFor sheer beauty, the Nevada\nopal excels all others. These stones\nare rare in perfect condition, but\nwhen one is found and cut, its value\nis high. Opals of the highest quality\nhave been mined in Humboldt, Nye,\nPershing, Lyon, and Churchill coun\nties. From the Virgin Valley district\nin Humboldt county the world’s\nlargest opal is known to have been\ntaken.

SPAHR\nProfessor of Economics, New York University\nThe economic* of labor and the\njconomics of agriculture are *up\nxxsed to be segments of economics in\nfen era! and to conform to the same\nscientific stand\nards and pre\nmises that must\ncharacterize\ngeneral econo\nmics if it is tru\nly scientific.\nGenera] eco\nnomics is both\na science and\nan art As a\nscience, it seeks\nand explains\nthe principle of\nhuman be\nhavior as peo\ntneir income.\nAs an art, the principles are applied\nto raise the standard of living. The\npoint of view is that of society as a\nwhole; the question of welfare re\nlates to society in general.\nThe economics of labor, like the\neconomics of agriculture, usually de\nparts from these standards. Labor\n“economics** is little more than a de\nscription of labor organizations, a\nhistory of laborers* efforts to in\ncrease their share of the social in\ncome, and a series of arguments as to\nwhy labor should get more of the so\ncial income. Just how much labor\nshould get is rarely made clear.\nSome so-called “labor economists**\nleave the impression that laborers\nshould get all the social income if\nthey can. In short, the principles set\nforth in “labor economics** are usu\nally vague, foggy, or nonexistent.\nThe art aspect of “labor economics**\nis little more than advocacy of a class\nstruggle. Labor “economists** rarely,\nif ever, look at the economics of the\nproblem as a whole. They do not give\nequal consideration to consumers,\nemployers, and owners of capital. In\ngeneral the consumers are ignored,\nthe employer and the owners of capi\ntal are regarded as the enemies of\nthe laborer.\nMost labor “economists** are tn fact\ntabor leaders in a class struggle, rath\ner than economists in the proper sense\nof the term. The one-sided, unfor\ntunate Wagner Labor Act is a natural\nresult of the efforts of labor “econo\nmists** who generally fought for it\nand subsequently defended it. One\ncould probably count on the fingers\nof one hand the genuine economists\nin the field of labor who stick to eco\nnomics and view labor’s problems in\nthe light of social welfare as a whole.\nSuch men are not welcome in the\ncircle of those labor “economists”\nwho are really little more than pro\nlabor agitators.\nThe consequences of this unfor\ntunate situation are that both labor\nand society in general have been\nmade to suffer unnecessarily The\nreal economics of labor is not widely\nunderstood, and the labor problem\nhas been reduced to a matter of class\nstruggle. This leads nowhere ex* »\nto trouble, and reveals relatively .\ntie intelligence In dealing with these\nmatters.\nAlmost exactly the same things can\nbe said about the so-called “eco\nnomics” of agriculture. Proof of this\ncan be conclusively demonstrated by\nscrutinizing the agricultural programs\nwhich this nation has seen advanced\nfor many years, but particularly\nsince 1933. In general, economic prin\nciples have not only been largely\nignored, but vigorous efforts have\nbeen made to set up programs which\nrun counter to economic laws The\nresults ought to be obvious by this\ntime. Just as the so-called “labor\neconomists" have perpetuated a huge\nunemployment, so have the so-called\n“agriculture economists*’ perpetuated\nagricultural distn -s. Look at the fol\nlowing prices of four principal agri\ncultural products at leading markets:\n1933 1938\nMay 13 Oct. 29\nWheat (per bu.) 75.75c 66.75c\nCorn (per bu.) 45.00c 32.37c\nOats (per bu.) 27.37c 27.00c\nCotton (per lb.) 8.85c 8 93c\nThe prices of hogs, steers, butter,\neggs, and wool were higher on the\nlatter date than in 1933; nevertheless,\nthere is an important lesson to be\nfound in the prices listed above.\nThe lessons of price-fixing are\nclear. Restriction of production in\ncreases costs to consumers. Subsidies -\nperpetuate maladjustments Agricul\ntural programs which raise prices so\nthat exports decline, or which In\ncrease the use of machinery and un\nemployment, or which Invite more\npeople to engage in agriculture, or\nwhich increase social costs so that the\ndemand for agricultural products de\nclines, all lead to trouble.\nEconomics is one thing; politico\nand dope ere something else.\nRainbow Comes\nDown to Earth\nThe rainbow has come down to\nearth — to sell products, help health\nand brighten life. Color, in fact, is\ncoming of age, report James Mc\nQueeny and Edward Podolsky, M.D.,\nin the current Rotarian magazine,\nsubmitting evidence to prove that it\naffects buying moods, working or\nfatigue moods, amusement, social,\nand educational moods, and even\ncertain moods associated with path\nological or psychological disturb\nances.\nColor, in a word, has burst like a\nrocket in the merchandising world,\nthey declare, for it is used not only\nin packages and containers, but also\nin the products — green gasoline,\nred mercurochrome, purple anti\nfreeze, and many others. Business is\nexploring and exploiting the possi\nbilities of color in 10,000 novel and\ninteresting ways.\n“Color is coming to be used in\na thousand ways to induce other\nthan buying moods: to promote,\nfor example, efficiency, or mental\nhealth and quietness, or reHeve eye\nstrain, or to give a favorable set\nting for producing almost any de\nsired mood,” say these writers.\n“Metabolism and muscular activity\nhave been found to be stimulated\nunder certain kinds of colored\nlights, hindered under others.”\nInspection tables in certain hos\niery mills, for example, are painted\nblue to relieve eyestrain, according\not McQueeny and Podolsky. A man\nufacturer of radio tubes painted\nworkmen’s benches blue to offset\nthe feeling of heat created by a\nwelding process—blue is a “cool”\ncolor.

Las Vegas\n- I", 'Explaining Law\nOf Compensation\nCARSON CITY, December 28 —\nHow much money will I be able to\ndraw In out-of-work benefits in\ncase I lose my Job? How much will\nI get each week and how will I go\nabout getting my weekly checks?\nThose questions will be the ones\nmost frequently aimed at Nevada’s\nunemployment compension division\nafter January 1, 1939, when the\nstate begins payment of weekly\ncash benefits to eligible, unem\nployed workers under the Nevada\ncompensation law.\nThe law provides that the most a\nworker can draw each week for\ntotal unemployment is one-half his\nformer regular weekly wage, not to\nexceed $15; thus a worker who has\nearned $30 weekly would be able to\ndraw $15 in benefits; a worker who\nhad earned $24 per weeki would be\neligible to draw $12. The least a\ntotally unemployed and eligible\nworker will draw in benefits will\nbe either $7 or three-fourths of his\nformer full-time weekly wage,\nwhichever is the less.\nUnder the law the maximum num\nber of weeks in any worker’s ben\nefit year for which he can draw his\nfull benefit amount for total un\nemployment is set at 18. Accord\ningly, if a worker were eligible for\n$15 weekly the most money he could\ndraw would be $270 in 18 weekly\npayments of $15 each.\nDuring the first three months of\nbenefit payments, determination of\nthe amount to which a worker is\nentitled is made directly from the\nworker’s wage earnings reported by\nhis employer, for work performed\nduring the first nine months of 1938.\nBecause wage records were not re\nquired of employers prior to Janu\nary 1, 1938, earnings previous to\nthat time will not be counted.\nTo be eligible at all for benefits\nthe worker must have earned, dur\ning his base period, at least 16 times\nwhat he would be entitled to as a\nweekly benefit amount; thus, a\nworker who had earned $20 weekly\nwould be entitled, if otherwise eli\ngible, to draw $10 per week in ben\nefits. If, during the first nine\nmonths of 1938, he had earned\nexactly 16 times $10 or $160, then\nhe would be eligible, but the\namount he could draw would be\nsmaller than if he had earned $20\nweekly straight through the nine\nmonths’ period.\nIn the case of the man who had\nearned exactly $160 during his base\nperiod, the total amount he would\nbe able to draw in unemployment\ncompensation would be $26.67 in two\nchecks of $10 each and one for $6.67.\nThis amount is determined by cred\niting to his account “benefit cred\nits’’ at the rate of one-sixth of his\ntotal quarterly earnings during his\nbase period and one-sixth of $160 is\n$26.67, or the total amount which\ncan be drawn by this particular\nworker. The maximum benefit cred\nits which any worker can be cred\nited with during any one quarter is\n$890, set forth in the law. If a\nworker had earned $120 monthly for\nthe entire nine months, then he\nwould have total earnings of $1080\nduring his base period. One-sixth of\n$1080 or $180 would be the full\namount he could draw, at the rate\nof $15 weekly for unemployment\ncompensation benefits.\nAlso provided for in the law are\n“partial” benefit payments to those\nworkers who are partially unem\nployed through no fault of their\nown. For cases of partial unem\nployment, the law provides a math\nematical formulae for the comput\ning of small benefits.\nIn answer to the question “How\nmust I go about getting my weekly\nbenefits?” division officials point\nout that every worker wishing to\nclaim out-of-work payments must\nregister for work at his nearest\nemployment service office and there\nfile his benefit claim. After serving\na two-week “waiting period,” the\nman can become eligible for bene\nfits for the third week of unem\nployment, provided of course that\nhe has not been successful in find\ning another job. The employment\nservice office then certifies him as\nunemployed to the unemployment\ncompensation division and his ben\nefit check for his third week is\nmailed directly to him by the un\nemployment compensation agency;\nthe check itself will, in all proba\nbility, arrive sometime during the\nfourth week, and will continue for\neach successive week of unemploy\nment until his benefit credits have\nbeen exhausted.\nEmployment service offices, lo\ncated in Reno, Fallon, Tonopah, Lias\nVegas, Pioche, Ely, Elko, Winne\nmucca and Lovelock/ have been\ngeared up to handle claims against\nthe unemployment compensation di\nvision and unemployed workers in\nthose areas must register for work\nat their nearest office and file their\nclaims for benefits. In addition,\nthey must report back to the em\nployment office weekly to deter\nmine if a Job ha* been located for\nthem. If not, they file a continued\nclaim for benefit*.\nFor those workers living in towns\nor communities not near an employ\nment service office, itinerant ser\nvice has been arranged where work\ners may report once weekly to a\nrepresentative of the employment\nservice who will register them for\nwork and accept unemployment\ncompensation claims. In remote\nareas, where the number of work\ners claiming benefits would not\njustify itinerant service, “mail\nclaims” will be made available and\nthe worker will be able to file his\nclaim by mail. Large posters, en\ntitled “Attention Workers,” have\nbeen placed in conspicuous places in\nsuch communities and fully advise\nemployees as to how to file a claim\nby mail.\nRotarians Hear\nCalifornia Man\nHoward Jay, past president of the\nDowney, Calif., Rotary club, editor\nof the 107th Rotary district publi\ncation “The Cog,” and a lecturer at\nthe University of Southern Califor\nnia, was the principal speaker at\nThursday’s meeting of Las Vegas\nRotary club.\nThe speaker took as his subject\n“Rotary Programs’’ and for 30 min\nutes gave sage advice to the mem\nbers who may be called upon to\ncarry out club programs.\nReferring to Rotary, the speaker\ndeclared that there are many defi\nnitions to describe the system, some\ngood and some bad. He illustrated\nthe difficulty of an accurate defi\nnition by relating the anecdote of\nth© Irishman newly arrived in New\nYork who, seeing some cranberries\nin a store window, askpd what\ncranberries are.\n“I can’t tell you exactly,” replied\nhis Irish friend, “but I know they\nmake a darned sight better apple\nsauce than prunes.”\nFrank Gusewelle reported as\nchairman of the committee on en\ntertainment of the large group of\nRotarians of the 107th district com\ning to Las Vegas and Boulder dam\nJanuary 21, that the Vernon Rotary\nclub which is sponsoring the event\nhas requested that 500 tickets for\nthe proposed banquet be sent them\nfor sale.\nMr. Gusewelle stated that more\nthan 500 visitors will be present,\narriving Saturday, January 21, by\nrail and auto, and that it will re\nquire the cooperation and active\nassistance of Las Vegas Rotarians\nto properly entertain them and\ntransport them to Boulcter City, the\ndam and Lake Mead.\nA heavy frost usually does away\nwith the flies and bugs, but up to\nthis time it has unfortunately been\nunable to do anything about deci\nmating the jitterbugs.\n^jUTT^JKgMgggJN BIG _Kessler\nfElP’lS* ggAD "^pUlS- MOTHER\nfiHr (SiJiTTlM\' W THERE 4WT AO NWRE\nBSy sat\' cay J§ "T" this* &>&>*?*-*** el\\\nra XUPUT 9 M W4WTC H/M T BB A \\p4\\\nUsM AW?H 1 * M frJLoofZ IV/4LKER »A1 A\n^>-r-—Department s*ra«E /r ,\n^—Ljmmew m CKoa^J g\nR!AO WBOVNF, OF U4& COLUMWA DPOAD\nC4STIAJO SW&M.
