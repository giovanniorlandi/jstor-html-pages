STEEL, EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR., Cordova, ALASKA, SATURDAY, MARCH 17, 1917., A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT., That the present system of government of Alaska is inade, quate for our needs is being proven more and more conclusive, ly every day. It is in reality a misgovernment of Alaska, and, what is needed just now is government for Alaska. For years, Alaskan affairs have suffered from such a maladministration,, that if the territory had not been a veritable storehouse of trea, sure, and its resources practically unlimitable, it would have, long ago been transformed into a barren desert, and shorn of all, its population. The territory owes its existence today, not to, the benevolence of a paternal government, but in spite of the, handrances to its development set up by groups of ignorant, politicians of both parties who have attempted\'to make laws, for this northern country from the standpoint of an effete east., After years of trial, the hybrid form of government which, we now have lias shown itself to be a complete failure. Since, the purchase of the territory from Russia, the government of, the I\'nited States has been paid by it millions of dollars from, various sources; from taxes levied on a people without a repre, sentative in the taxing body—the principle for which the, American colonies rebelled against England in the latter part, of the eighteenth century., Alaska now needs money to continue the construction of, wagon roads and trails, without which the country will fall, into stagnation. She needs funds to push the work on the gov, ernment railroad to an early completion, upon the operation of, which the development of a vast region of interior Alaska is al, most entirely dependent. She needs an adequate system of, lighthouses, a proper survey of the coast, and the charting of, shoals and reefs that every year exact their toll in property, and human lives, through the parsimony and narrow niinded, ness of a few bigoted politicians., Tlu> administration at Washington has shown a disposition, to grant us a return on the money that has been collected from, Alaska, but the attitude of the administration lias been frustrat, ed by a group of positicians in congress. The last session of the, disastrous sixtv-fourth congress has dealt us a body blow, foul, in its nature, that, if not remedied soon, will work incalculable, damage to the entire territory. Its failure to enact the army, hill, which includes the sundry civil bill, which include appro, priations to carry on work, the accomplishment of which is vital, to the life of the territory, should be the means of creating such, a demand for a system of adequate government that the evil of, it will be not unmixed with good., rni. . i • i a i . i i • i i i • ., i in- immcv vyiuuu xviaatvuil tuttm pi 1SVS WOUK1 liavt* dUrlVOd, ?bnmud.i6irinrDwa^tkie5‘^aM^^s^t^si, Alaska in previous years, and still is getting. But a few men, seem to have appointed themselves as watchdogs of that par, ticular entrance of the United States treasury, with the object, of stoppig the outgo of every penny. That there are other doors, to the treasury which are pouring forth a golden flood for other, and less worthy purposes does not make a particle of difference, to them. A postoffice for $.‘50,000 at Podunk, Illinois, multiplied, by a hundred other places, from which the government never, got a cent in return, seems to them to be a worthy cause for ex, penditure. But money to construct useful arteries of commerce, and travel and to open up new lands for settlement, and from, which the nation will reap returns of greater value as time, passes; money which the government has already received from, us, they absolutely block us away from., Recently on the floor of the national senate Senator Over, man, ot South Carolina, stated that by an efficient system of, book keeping the government could save the nation $.‘50,(XX),(XXX), a year, and lie asked the unanimous permission of the senate to, give the president authority to install such a system, stating, that it would he impossible to accomplish the reform in any, other way, as it would lop off numerous heads in different de, putt meats, causing such a pressure to bear that no other source, of power could get the reform through. Some pinheaded, pea, nut politician thereupon got up on his hind legs and declared, he objected to giving any Democratic president so much power,, and as it takes the unanimous consent of the senate to put such, a resolution through, it was lost. Think of it, enough money, saved in one year by an installation of a simple set of books to, build the Alaska railroad, and lost because President Wilson, happens to be a Democrat., President Wilson has a right to be peeved and get his,, back up. If there is any means in the world by which a gag, rule can be put into effect in the senate, it should be put into, operation, the sooner the better. When one man can hold the, floor until he is forced to quit through physical exhaustion;, when if his lungs can stand the gaff, he can read through a coni\', plete set of Laura Jean Libby, some method of silencing him, should be handy, if chloroform has to be resorted to as a last, measure., These and other methods have been used to hand us dirtv, deals for too long. It would seem that we have stood it long, enough. Let’s get busy, then, and\' try for new government., Statehood has been suggested, but it does not apj>ear that we, are yet ready for that. The most likely plan, and one that, would probably get the best results^ is Secretary Lane’s com, mission plan—if we can get non-partisan, resident commission, ers, who can be on the ground, investigating our needs and, studying conditions with a view to meeting these needs as they, should be met. Put this commission under any department that, seems the best one with which to co-operate, give them the pow, er to formulate and carry out plans for the development of the, country, and the future of Alaska will take care of itself, and, Alaska will take her rightful place in the nation.—Fairbanks, Citizen., -:o:, The bread\' card system has become so popular in Berlin, that it may outlive the wur because of its democracy, it is re, ported.

(!. Smith, transmitted to the, legislature by Governor J. F. A., Strong. The report points out some, of the defects in the law., Briefly digested, the defects In the, license tax schedules are as follows:, Attorneys at law, Doctors, Dentists, -—Recommendation that schedule be, clarified, so that it may be establish, ed whether two or more attorneys or, doctors doing business in one firm, must pay separate taxes., Automobiles — Law does not define, whether pleasure cars must pay this, tax, or whether only automobiles used, in mercantile work., Bakeries—Because of great amount, of unlicensed competition that baker, ies are forced to fight, it is recommen, ded that this schedule either be abol, ilshed or tha^ an exemption from the, tax be declared on a limited amount, of business., Fish Salteries and Mild Cure Plants, —Recommendation is made for a ], means of enforcing this schedule, be-1, cause considerable money is lost to j, the territory through fly-by-night out- |, fits that do not pay taxes., Fish Traps — Recommendation is |, made for means to enforce the pay, ment of the tax of $100 each on fish, traps, so that “mosquito traps" and, other fish catching contrivances now, evading payment will be made to con, tribute their just share to the terri-1, torial coffers., \'***• 41VVO IV IO 1 VV/V/iiJ IlivUUUU lliai I, this schedule be abandoned, unless a, tax be imposed also upon the various, types of seines used and means pro, vided for the enforcement of all the, fishery schedules., Cold Storage Plants — Because of, the method of computing the annual, business done by these plants, an am, endment is asked so as to bring the, so-called “customs” plants under the, provisions of the act., Laundries —- Recommendation is, made that the tax in this schedule, be a graded one, depending upon the, amount of business done, and that, the exemption from tax be decreased., Mines and Mining — Recommenda, tion is made that the act be clarified, mining operations will come undubi, tably under the provisions of the act., It is also recommended that the miner, be permitted to select a tax year other, than that fixed by law if he desires, to do so., Scavengers — It is recommended, that this schedule be dropped, because, of the hardship it works on men of, limited means., Vessels — Tax assessment rolls pre, pared by authorized persons of vessels, doing business in Alaska would be of, great aid in enforcing the payment, of this schedule. Many complaints, have been made of unlicensed boats, doing business., The report recites some general ob, servations of Territorial Treasurer, Smith. He says, concerning the gen, eral property tax: “It is extremely, doubtful if a general property tax is, practicable in Alaska under the pres, ent form of government. In any case,, having in view the tax troubles of, many of the states, it is recommend, ed that no general property tax law, be enacted until the matter can be, given thorough study and upon re, commendations by a commission spe, cially designated for that purpose.”, A plea is made for additional office, furniture, more office space, better, filing cases and safe storage for re, cords and books., fTKn V.4 „ e 41_X_II_»_•, treasurer on December 31, 1916, the, end of the biennium, shows a total of, $217,026.50 in the territorial treasury., Of this sum $196,384.58 is in the gen, eral fund, $18,381.61 in the forest re, serve fund and $2,260.31 in the fish, eries fund.

LOUIS, March 14. — There are, the sapie old disappointments, the, same old rocks and the same old sec, ond division finish ahead for the St., Louis Cardinals. Nothing else can, be said. The team, if anything, is, weaker this year than last, which is, saying considerable., Miller Huggins has some good ball, play^Ts^riWning around for him. There, is Roger llornsby, the amazing youth, who disputed the batting champion, ship of the National League last year., There is Willie\' Doak and there is, Mule Watson. Both are excellent pit, chers. But they can’t win a pennant, by themselves, nor with the help of, the crew that is helping. First base, seems to be just as much a problem, as ever for Huggins, with the proba, bility that Butler and Snyder will al, ternate on the job just as in former, days. Betzel or Butler for second base,, Hornsby or Miller for shortstop, and, Hornsby or Miller for third base, seems to be about all that can be said, for the infield. Miller, Wilson and, Bob Bescher, none of whom has, knocked the populace still with his, antics for some years, are carded for, outfield duty., The catching staff is nothing to en, thuse over, with Snyder and Gonzales, to do the bulk of the work. In the, pitching staff, and there alone, seems, to be any fame that the Cardinals may, lay claim to. Willie Doak is a real, star. If he is in "the top form he will, win a lot of games and he will have, plenty of help from Lee Meadows,, midget star, and Mule Watson, the, huge recruit from Texas.
