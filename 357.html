A mascot, ac\ncording to the dictionary, is anything\nthat brings good luck or is supposed\nto do so. In the navy a vessel of war\n1* generally supplied with some kind\nof an animal to serve the purpose of a\n~ABscot. Monkeys, parrots, goats, dogs,\ndTTts and even pigs have been drafted\nInto the service of l iicle Sam in this\ncapacity. (hie of the most accom\nplished mascots on an American ship\not war at present is the cat which is\nbelieved to bring good luck to the cruis\ner Chicago and her gallant men. Pussy\nis very popular with officers and crew\nand has been taught many tricks. ,\\\nsnapshot was recently secured of this\nclever feline iu the act of giviug the\nmilitary salute to an otlieer. .just like\nany jacky.\nHue of the most famous mascots in\nthe navy was Admiral Dewey\'s dog\nHob. Hob was picked up by some of\nthe Olympia’s sailors in Manila bay.\nHe was a chow dog. just a little ball\nof fur. with a tail bent up over bis\nback. The chow dog is a near relative\nof the Eskimo dog. and poor people in\n< hina often eat him; hence his name.\nHob followed the admiral wherever he\nwent on board the flagship. and he and\nthe hero of Manila bay became fast\nfriends. Another famous mascot of the\nnavy was Hilly, the goat mascot of the\nBrooklyn, which achieved uotorietv in\nthe period succeeding the Spanish war\n/s\'\n> ■\nCOovutQHr k>\nVvALPUN rmCfrY\nMASCOT OF THE CHICAGO SAM TING.\nwhen the vessels prominent in that\ncontest were so often visited by eivili\nmis. Billy took a keen interest in\nvisitors who wen* shown over the\ncruiser when tin* Brooklyn was in port.\nSo long as they were looking at him\nhe remained very polite, but just as\nsoon as their backs were turned he\nyielded to the hutting proclivities char\nacteristic of the goat family since the\ntime of Xoali and the Hood.\nThe battleship Oregon obtained a\nuniipie and very lucky mascot at the\ntime of the hattie of Santiago. The\nmen of the Oregon succeeded in rescu\ning from one of the conquered Spanish\nships, the Maria Theresa, a big black\npig. They took him aboard and named\nhim Blanco in honor of the Spanish\n©nicer who was captain general it\nHavana in the latter part of the regime\nof the dons. Blanco was a great fa\nvorite and proved a very well behaved\nmascot for a member of the pig family.\nAlthough brought up among Spaniards,\nbe took readily to American ways, sub\nmitted readily to being washed when\nthe decks of the Oregon were scrubbed\nmid even became attached to the hose\nwhich was turned on him upon these\noccasions. He was one of the clean\nest pigs that ever trod the deck of a\nwarship. He evinced a good ear for\nmusic, for when the “mess gear” was\nsounded lie would start for the mess\ndeck with the mtyi. To reward him for\nIlls good behavior the latter would oc\ncasionally take him on shore to eat\ngrass. The Oregon’s pig conformed to\nthe popular idea that a mascot to bring\nreal good luck should Im* homely.

We have been instru\nmental in passing laws in the States of\nPennsylvania and New Jersey provid\ning tnat the children attending the pub\nlie schools of those States shall be fur\nnished with their text-books free of all\ncost. As a result, the attendance at the\nschools has increased over twenty im\nn ut. in a short time.\nIt has also been instrumental in pass\ning compulsory education laws in sev\neral States. We recently had a law\npassed in Pemisi lvania providing that\nno teacher he allowed to wear the dis\ntinctive garb of any religious denomi\nnation or organization. Laws providing\nthat the American flag must be floated\nover the public schools during the ses\nsions thereof have also been adopted in\nvarious States through our instrumen\ntality.\nWe have presented over 3,1100 Ameri\ncan flags to tile public schools through\nout our land, and are still actively en\ngaged in that work We are determined\nthat “Our Flag*’ shall float over every\npublic school-house in our country.\nJohn W.

To ropy it ptireha-r the nee(*s\nsary blank book and both linen and\nlinen canvas as required.\nCut two pieces of canvas each the ex\nact size of one cover of the book. Then\nlay these down upon the linen in such\naway as to leave sullh eld space be\ntween for the Inline or tin* back of the\nbook two inches above, two inches be\nlow and two or three inches beyond at\neat h side, according to the size of the\nbook. Make some smooth Hour paste,\nand turn over and paste into the can\nvas the linen that projects both above\nand below. When that is quite dry cut\na strip of lining silk half an inch larger\nall round than the linen, turn in th •\nedges of each and baste the two neatly\ntogether. Slip stitch the edge-; tiruily.\nthen turn over into the silk the extra\nwidth beyond the stiffening and over\nhand the four ends together. Slip the\n4sU> p\nfv j\nA l SKIT I, (HIT.\ncovers of tlie book into the pockets so\nformed, and you will tind that you\nhave a perfect tit and that only decora\ntion remains to complete the work. On\nthe cover given the lettering and con\nventional figures were both couched\nwith gold before making up, but any\ncombination of color can be made or\nany other design either painted or em\nbroidered with equally good results.\nTwo ribbon loops, one at each edge of\nthe cover, through which a pencil can\nbe slipped, add a finishing touch and\nserve to keep tin* book closed as well\nas to keep the convenient pencil al\nways at hand.\nAN ORIGINAL OFFERING.\nC\'liriMtniiiN <;ift I\'or a Plant Lover\nnml lloiiNt*k*e|M*r.\nFor a plant lover a plant stand is a\nvery acceptable Christmas gift. In the\naccompanying sketch is an idea for a\nstand of a steady and substantial na\nture to hold four pots, or, prettier still,\none large pot pushed well back in each\ncompartment, with two smaller ones\nin front containing some plant of a\nLfL\nPLANT STAND.\ntrailing nature. In the latter case the\n“art” pot shown in the illustration\ncould ho dispensed with.\nTin l aetoal making of this stand\nwould be best intrusted to a carpenter,\nbut the panels thinking each compart\nment offer scope for tin* energies of\ntin* home worker. Beaten copper,\ncarving and poker work would be\nequally effective, and the rest of the\nstand should be stained mahogany.\nBefore the compartments are lixed on\nit would be a good plan to get the\nplatform part covered with a sheet of\nzinc. The result would be a durable\nand thoroughly useful little bit of fur\nniture.\nIf the original frame, sent the day\nbefore Christinas, be tilled with grow\ning plants, the artistic value Is en\nhanced.\n!\\i*elle<*ae Idenn.\nNeedlecases are such stupid, old\nmaidish affairs, as a rule, and yet such\nnecessary tilings, that an idea invented\nthe other day is well worth recording\nfor the benefit of the Christmas pres\nent maker.\nA piece of flowered ribbon was Used,\nlined with fine white flannel, just like\nthe pin cases with which every travel\ner is provided. The management of\ntin* needles is the unusual part, livery\nneedle, and there were dozens of them,\nfv.is threaded, stuck in and its thread\nneatly wound around it.\nMost of the needles were threaded\nwith white cotton and black siP/, but\nalmost every color was represented\nas well. and. tin* original one being\nfor a girl w ho wore tan and red most\nof all. a goodly supply of those two\ncolors was included.\nOf course there was every sort of\nneedle, from the tiniest of glove needle*\nto shoe and darning needles, each\ntlircidcd with its iirouer kind\nRailroad Schedules.\nCUMBERLAND and\nPENNSYLVANIA\nRAILROAD CO.\nTI M K TARLK\nIN c fleet since ‘Jot’lock Sunday Morniu.’\nMAY 2 1.1 905.\nNu - Nm ,\n| 127 I 1251 123 j 122 121 I*2o\n\' pm Ipmam ; stations ami pm pm\n1 j ;jo!: 2.->|l 1 in!
