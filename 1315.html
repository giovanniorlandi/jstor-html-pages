        <pre>['VOLUME 1\nŕtrtretret\nHONOR TO THE THIRTY-FIFTH\nNogales will Show Aooreciation for a\nGallant Regiment. Parade, .Review\nand Receptions for all—Officers and\nMen Alike\nThe committe of arrange\nments finds that it is possible\nto enlarge the scope of the pro\nposed tribute to the gallant\n35th upon the eve of their de\nparture, after serving in garri\nson at the line city through a\nperiod of one year and about a\nhalf. And it is all due to the\n■quick wit of a lady, who suggest\ned to the finance sub-commit\ntee yesterday that a reception\nto the men, on the evening fol\nlowing that given the officers,\nwould fill the bill nicely. Her\nsuggestion was seized quickly\nby the full committee. The re\nception and ball to the officers\nwill be given at the Santa Cruz\nClub this evening. Thursday\nevening the same function will\nbe repeated for the enlisted\nmen; and if there should be any\nwho fail to find room that eve\nning there will be a second re\npetition on Friday evening. Ail\nthe people will be on hand\nThursday and Friday evenings,\nto “give the glad hand,” and |\nbid Godspeed to the rank and\nfile just as heartily as to the\nofficers.\nThe parade and review will\nbe carried out this afternoon.\nAll the troops stationed at No\ngales will be in the line. Col.\nFrier had desired to turn out\nthe transportation train with\nthe troops; but there are in the\nrailroad yard a large number of\ncars laden with, army supplies\nthat must be discharged in the\nshortest time possible, which\nwill not admit of delay for a\nmoment; so that feature of the\nparade will have to be omitted,\nArmy Y. M. C. A.\nEntertainment\nWith two years as reader of\nAllegheny College Glee Club\nand five years reader of Mac\nWalter’s Round the World\nQuartette, and other years of\nplatform work as humprist, im\npersonator, baritone soloist and\nlecturer, Mr. William Evan\nThomas comes to the local “Y\nfor two nights’ entertainments,\ntonight and Thursday. He is\naccompanied by Mrs. Thomas\nas pianist, thereby assuring un\nexcelled entertainment for\nthose two nights. And especial\nly when one of those marvelous\nsong fests that Prof. Russell is\nresponsible in camp for is added\neach night. An invitation to\nattend and expect the best is ex\ntended.\nThe Daily Morning oasis\nas all the trucks, teams and\nwagons must be devoted to\nthat work.\nElsewhere are published re\nquests from Mayor Harrison\nthat all places of business close\nbetween the hours of 2:30 and\n4 o’clock, or when the parade\nis dismissed, should that be\nearlier; and from Town Mar\nshal Lowe, clearing the streets\nof automobiles, vehicles, etc.,\nfrom 2:30 p. m. until the parade\nhas passed.\nThe column will start from\nthe camp at 3 o’clock, shaip,\nand will proceed southward\nalong Grand Avenue to Banks\nbridge, crossing there and con\ntinuing along Morley Avenue\nto Park Street, west along Park\nto Grand Avenue, and north\nward along that street back to\ncamp.\nThe marquise at the Town\nHall will be the reviewing stand\nwhich will be taken by Col.\n\'Frier and staff, when, at the\nhead of the parade they reach\n1 that point. Federal, state,\ncounty and town officers wiil,\noccupy the reviewing stand\nwith Col. Frier and his staff.\nI The reception at evening, for\nthree days, will consist of patri\notic speeches and music, ending\nwith an informal dance. Every\nthing will be very informal and\nsimple—officers and men in\nservice uniform, and civilians\nin business dress.\nThe streets will be decorated\nappropriately, and every effort\nwill be made to render notable\nin the annals of Nogales the de\nj parture of the gallant 25th.\nTannery and\nShoe Factory\nGov.P. E. Calles, chief execu\ntive of the state of Sonora, has\ntaken steps for establishment in\nthat state of an extensive tanne\nry and shoe factory. At the\nbeginning a capital of $50,000,\ngold, will be invested, that will\nbe increased as the business ex\npands.\nImported shoes are very ex\npensive, as in addition to the\nhigh cost in the United States\nthere is a heavy federal duty,\nwhich will make the new indus\ntry very profitable, when there\nis taken into consideration the\ngreat amount of raw material\navailable.\nAN INTERNATIONAL NEWSPAPER\n*X ■ * .\nqual Rights For All; Special Privileges For None.” —Andrew Jackson.\nNATIONAL CAPITAL NEWS NOTES!\nAmbassador Francis Leaves Vologda-\nWholesale Arrest of Suffraeets—Long\nList of Casualties from the Front-\nPostmaster General Takes ov6r Cables\nWASHINGTON, August 6.—President Wilson today receiv\ned suggestions from the cabinet on the personnel of the economic\nmission that goes to Russia.

The link of the crumbling German chain is on the\nVesle in the town of Braizne, six miles northwest of Fismes,\nabout half way between that city and Soissons. French troops\nwere on the outskirts of Braizne late this afternoon escaping cap\nture during the night.\nFoch is in no hurry to get forward. He has the Crown\nPrince “where he wants him,” and is now bringing up heavy ar\ntillery preparatory to starting the last lap of his counter-drive\nwhich is destined to throw the German army to the north bank of\nthe Aisne.\nTwo bridges across the Vesle near Braizne were captured\nL oday by the French. All the German crossing points, bridges\nmd pontoons over the Aisne are under constant bombardment by\nallied artillery, French and American flyers adding to the de\nstructive work by continuous bombing raids.\nA new and important advance was registered by the French\nin the last 24 hours in Picardy. They progressed on a three mile\nfront north of Montdidier and pushed clear to the western em\nbankment of the Avre, between Morisel and Braches. Military ex\nperts look for a German “stragetic readjustment” of the front,\nwhich means a general retreat, beginning on the Picardy front.\nARTILLERY ACTIVE ALONG THE VESLE.\nPARIS, August 6.—Only artillery activity west of Soissons\nand along the Vesle is reported in tonight’s war office commu\nnique.\nRUSSIAN FRIEND OF THE ALLIES ASSASSINATED\n.LONDON, August 6.—M._.

HARRISON,\nMayor.\nAIDS IN PARCHMENT READING 1\nCamera Used Successfully In Preserv*\nIng Old Writing Now Barely\nDiscernible.\nBefore the days of books parchments\nbecame so costly that economical schol\nars erased more or less perfectly what\nhad been written and used them a sec\nond time. In this manner some highly\ninteresting and valuable manuscripts\nhave been lost to the world, says\nNew York Herald. But In many cases\nthe ancient characters are still visi\nble. 1\nIt was not long ago that photography\nwas first successfully applied for this\nwork. The color of the faded ink of\nthe older writing on a palimpsest Is\nyellow. A photograph of such a man\nuscript was made through a yellow\nscreen. The result was a negative on\nwhich the old writing was barely dis\ncernible, being a little darker than the\nbackground, while the later black\nwriting appeared distinctly as white\nletters.\nNext an ordinary negative on a bro\nmide plate was made and from this\nwas produced a transparent positive on\nwhich both writings appeared dark and\nabout equally distinct. Then the trans\nparency was superposed on the first\nnegative so that the dark letters of\nthe later writing covered the light let\nters, representing the same writing In\nthe negative. They were thus elimi\nnated, being indistlnguishably merged\nwith the general dark background pro\nduced by the combination of positive\nand negative. But the earlier charac\nters, since they were dark In both\ncases, appeared In the combination In\ntensely black and distinct.\nROOM FOR MORE DEMOCRACY\nWriter of Opinion That Parent* Gov\nern Too Much by Mandate or\nby Exhortation.\nThe typical parent is not democrat\nic In the treatment of his children.\nHe likes to govern by mandate or ex\nhortation. He dogmatically asserts\nhis views on every question that\narises, and insists that he knows more\nthan his children, and he has no re\nspect for their “notions.” One can\nlisten to a parent telling hls thirteen\nyear-old boy what kind of a cap he\nmust wear and how and when he must\nwear It, though the boy says “the\nboys will snicker” at him, and he docs\nnot want to be “the goat” of the crowd.\nBut the parent will listen to no argu\nment; he says he knows better than\nthe boy what the latter ought to do,\nand he does not care what the boy*\nthink.\nMuch of the conflict between par\nents and children is due to the fact\nthat the former do not recognize the\nright of the latter to express opin\nions contrary to those of the parent\non any question or problem whatso\never. One can hear such a parent\nsay: “I will teach you to obey. When\nyour opinions are wanted, I will ask\nfor them,” and so on.\nA parent who Is a bully never can\nget an insight Into his children’9\nthoughts about conduct and so he can\nnever know what sport is to be a\nparent.—M. V. O’Shea in The Mother’!\nMagazine.\nJust Suppose These Things.\nLight travels at the rate of 186,000\nmiles per second. As everyone knows,\nwe are now looking at some Stars with\nlights that left them centuries ago.\nSuppose that you could be shot lntc\nspace at a velocity greater than that\nof light. And suppose that you were\narmed with a telescope so powerful\nthat you could see everything that hap\npened on this earth. A time would\ncome when history would unfold ltsell\nbefore your astonished eyes. You\nwould see Napoleon losing the battle of\nWaterloo; you would see Benjamin\nFranklin and all the other signers ol\nthe Declaration of Independence vow\ning that they would be hanged rath\ner than endure British oppression anj\nlonger; you would see the surrender nl\nYorktown, the battle of New Orleans\nand the naval fight off Santiago; you\nwould see the death of Julius Caesar,\nand then Mark Antony making love tc\nCleopatra on the Nile. If you like, you\ncould Juggle yourself back and forth\nso that you could see the same event\nover and over again and make a spe\ncial study of it. —Popular Science\nMonthly.\nThe Naive Indexer.\nThe librarian who indexed Wilde's\n“Importance of Being Earnest” as the\nology must have been kin to the libra\nrian of a public library in a certain\nCornish town who indexed Borrow’s\n“Bible in Spain” under the same head\ning.

Personal calls were be-j\ngun, and help solicited, consisting of\nmoney, material or labor. So hearty\nwas the response that within a month\na lot was purchased, then a three-room\nhouse with two porches was erected,\nouthouses for cow and chickens were\nbuilt, a garden fenced, and a well\nbored, with windlass set up. Good ma\nterial was used —concrete foundation,\nand brick flue and chimney. The lot\nhad been set in fruit trees when\nbought, so there was a ready-made or\nchard. And when the painter was\nthrough with the buildings an insur\nance agent gave a three-year policy in\ncase of fire. Every bit of the labor\nwas voluntary work.\nThe most eager helpers, however,\nwere the men who went In wagons to\nmove the family home. The matter\nhad been kept secret from them, and\nyou can imagine their surprise and joy.\nThey were a little black-eyed widow\nand three children, whom misfortune\nhad pursued relentlessly for many sad\nmonths. In their new home they were\nvery happy, and this made it all im\nmensely worth while.\nNow this didn’t happen just before\nThanksgiving or Christmas, but during\nthe blazing hot days of midsummer,\nwhen “sunny” Tennessee was a burn\ning reality.\nRAISING FOXES IN ALASKA\nAnimals Are Bred There for Their\nFur, and the Industry Is a Re\nmunerative One.\nThere are ten or twelve fox farms\nin Alaska. One of them, situated in\nthe Tanana valley, a mile and a half\nfrom Fairbanks, consists of ten acres\nof cleared land, the greater part of\nwhich is covered with pens in which\nthe animals live. From a distance the\nfox farm looks like a huge chicken\nyard, with walls of woven wire and\nhencoops of various sizes inside. Each\npen is 50 feet long, 8 feet wide and\nabout 10 feet high. The wire is tough\nsteel and is sunk about four feet in\nthe ground and is then bent so that it\nruns inward underground for about\ntwo feet to prevent the foxes from dig\nging out. At the top the wire has an\noverhang of two feet to prevent the\ncaptives from climbing over. Each\npen has a kennel made of boards, like\na dog kennel, the entrance to which is\na chute or a wooden pipe a foot\nsquare. Only one pair of foxes live in\neach pen. They are very timid and\nhave to be handled carefully. Most of\nthe fox farmers will not allow strang\ners to enter their property for fear\nthey will frighten the animals. The\nfoxes are fed with salmon, moose\nmeat, horse meat, rabbits, carrots and\nturnips. A common feed is rice and\nrabbits cooked together in a stew.\nSaints at Earthly Courts.\nThey tell a tale of two great saints\nat court, one a Dominican, one a Fran\nciscan. The king of France had the\nhonor to entertain the angel of the\nschools at dinner, once upon a time.\nNever a word spake he, nor morsel ate.\nHis eyes were fixed on the. opposite\nwall, while his mind followed out a\ntrain of thought to its conclusion; then\nfollowed a mighty thump on the table,\nand an exclamation: “Now that is\nconclusive against the Manichaeans!”\nSt. Bonaventura sat at such a ban-\nI quet, gazing intently upon the queen.\nThe king said: “Good Brother Bona\nventura, what thinkest thou?” To\nwhom the Franciscan said: “Ah, sire, I\nthink, if the beauty of an earthly mon\narch be so great, what must be the\nbeauty of the Queen of Heaven!”\n-\nThe Congressional Daily.\nThe old Congressional Globe was j\nmerged and name changed in 1873 to\nthe Congressional Record, which is is\ni sued daily during the sessions of con\nj gress. Each member of both houses i\n! of congress is supplied with a certain |\nnumber of the daily issues, and it is\nalso furnished to subscribers for $8\ni during the long session of congress and\n$4 during the short session. The su-1\nperintendent of documents, United\nStates government printing office,\nWashington, is authorized to sell pub\nlic documents at cost, and on applica\ntion that official will furnish, free of\ncharge, price lists showing, under top\nical headings, the publications avail\nable for sale.\nPraying and Doing.\nLord Palmerston—“ Pam” as he was\naffectionately termed by his friends—\nwas one of the shrewdest statesmen\nthat ever lived. When petitioned by j\nthe Scotch clergy to appoint a day for\nfasting and prayer, so that a threat\nened epidemic of cholera might be\naverted, he replied:\nj “Clean your streets, keep your homes 1\nclean, promote cleanliness and health\namong the poor, see that they are\nl plentifully supplied with good food\nand clothing, and employ right sani\ntary measures generally, and you will\nhave no occasion to fast and pray, nor\nwill the Lord hear your prayer while\nthese his preventors remain unheeded.”\nI\nWOUNDS STITCHED RY ANTS\nIngenious Operation That Is a Featurs\nof Surgical Work Amc-no the\nArabs Today.\nThe mandibles of ants and of sev\neral coleopterous insects, Scarites ir.\nj particular, have long been employed\nj in Asiatic surgery. This usage is of\n| the most ancient date with the sur\n! geons of India and is perpetuated in\nour day in Algeria by the Arab opera\n-1 tors and to some extent by the Turks\nI in Asia and the Greek barbers of\nSyria.\nAccording to an English entomo\nlogical journal, the barber presses\nupon the edge of the cut with the\nfingers of the left hand and applies\nj each ant by means of forceps held\n|in the right hand. The mandibles\n| of the ant are widely opened, the ani\nmal being in the defensive attitude,\nand as the insect is gradually brought\nnear the wound it seizes the pro\njecting surface and immediately forces\nits mandibles through the flesh, and\nremains In this attitude, pressing the\none mandible against the other with\nforce and consequently holds the two\nedges together. Then the barber sep\narates the head from the thorax with\na snip of the scissors, and the head\nwith the mandibles remaining in place\ncontinues its function while the thorax\nand abdomen fall to the ground.\nThe same operation is repeated with\nother ants until at times there\nmay be a dozen pairs of mandibles\nplaced at regular intervals, so that\nthrough its whole length the skin is\nunited by this very ingenious proce\ndure. The heads are allowed to re\nmain a few days, after which, since\nthe healing has been effected, they are\nloosened and having performed tlieir\noffice are henceforth useless.\nSTRANGE LAWS IN TJJRKEY\nPenalty for Threatening Heavier Than\nIf You Had Struck— Lawyer\nDefends Idea.\nIn Turkey, if you stole a horse it\nentailed from one to three years’ im\nprisonment; if you stole a sheep you\nwere liable to from three to seven\nyears. While you are figuring at this\nI will give you another instance of\nsubtle jurisprudence, John Van Ess\nwrites in Asia. If I drew a dagger\non you and stabbed you seriously, but\nyou recovered, I was liable to prison\nfrom one to three years. If, on the\nother hand, I drew a dagger on you\nhut did not touch you 1 might be im\nprisoned anywhere from three to seven\nyears.\nYusuf Effendi, a leading lawyer, was\nmuch disgusted with my obtuseness\nwhen I questioned the equitableness of\nthese penalties.\n“Why,” said he, “it is as plain as\nday. If you go to steal a horse the\nsupposition is you purpose to escape\non the horse’s hack, but if you go to\nsteal a sheep, inasmuch as you in the\nnature of the case cannot ride away\non the sheep’s back, it is fair to sup\npose that you come armed and ready\nto resist. Therefore, if • you steal a\nsheep you are the more guilty, in in\ntent at least, and deserve the greater\npenalty. And again, if I draw a dag\nger on you and though I wound you\nseriously, yet you do not die, the result\nis known —namely, bodily injury. But\nif I draw a dagger on you, even though\nI do not touch you, yet I might have\nkilled you, and therefore I also in that\ncase deserve the greater penalty.”\nCensus of a Vacant Lot.\nIn a little town in Illinois George N.\nWolcott conducted an investigation to\nfind out how many animals—or, rather,\nforms of animal life—inhabited an\nacre of city land, says Popular Science\nMonthly. The count in a city lot, ob\ntained by multiplying the contents of\na bucketful by the figures required for\nan acre, disclosed the fact that there\nwere between 2,000,000 and 2,500,000 of\ngrasshoppers, locusts, crickets, cock\nroaches, earwigs, lantern flies, plant\nlice, aphids and other “bugs” in one\nacre of land.\nThere will be, of course, a large va\nriation in the count according to the\nseason in which it is made. For ex\nample, there is a one-third increase in\nthe population in the spring over that\nin the autumn owing to the rapid mul\ntiplication of earthworms.\nThe Lowly Cinder.\nLong despised as a waste product,\nthe humble cinder is coming into its\nown. For years cinders were anathe\nmatized because the only purpose they\nseemed to fill was to get into one’s\neye, but with the widespread use of\ncement, cinders came into use as a\ni base for cement sidewalks, cellar bot\n, toms, etc. As a porous material to\ncarry water away from a cellar a few\nfeet of cinders placed around the foot\nings make excellent drainage, while as\na fill for holding wooden sleepers in\nplace in concrete, cinders mixed with\ncement make a light, firm bond. As a\n| base for driveways, cinders, when wa\n! ter-bound, and rolled or tamped, make\na firm foundation.\nWireless Improved.\nAccording to an English electrical\n! publication, a valuable improvement\nhas been made in the shape of the ad\ndition of metal springs to the aerials\nj on shipboard for the purpose of acting\nj as shock absorbers, thus overcoming\nto a great degree the tendency of this\ndelicate instrument to be put out of\nservice when the vessel experiences a\nsevere shock either from torpedo or\naccident. Heretofore it has been neces\nsary to take the aerials down when\nthe vessel is loading because of the\nmovement and vibration in the masts\ncaused by the use of the derricks.\nNOGALES, ARIZONA, WEDNESDAY, AUG. 7, 1918\nPOLICIES DF IDE\nWAII LABOR BOARD\nRIGHT OF UNIONIZED WORKERS\nTO BARGAIN WITH EMPLOYERS\nIS UPHELD BY IT.\nBETTER CONDITIONS SOUGHT\nGreat Storage Lumber Depot Opened\nat Gilmerton, Va.—Conservation of\nKerosene Is Urged—Allies\' Bombing\nPlanes Now Work in Squadrons.\n(From Committee on Public Information.)\nWashington.—The war labor poli\ncies board has made no rulings, it is\nannounced, making it impossible to\nchange rates of wages or working\nconditions in industry during the\nstandardization of such pay and con\nditions for war work. The board does\nnot seek to place restrictions on labor,\nbut is striving to better conditions\nthat will make fop? satisfaction and\ngreater efficiency.\nEnunciating its principles the war\nlabor policies board is committed to\nthe right of workers to organize into\ntrade unions and to bargain collec\ntively with their employers; continu\nance of existing union standards with\nthe right of the workers to obtain bet\nter conditions, wages and hours under\ndecisions of the national war labor\nboard; equal pay for equal work,\nwhether performed hy men or by wom\nen ; recognition of the basic eight-hour\nday where a law requires it but settle\nment of all questions of hours of work\nwith due regard to government neces\nsities and the welfare of the workers;\nmaintenance of the maximum of pro\nduction; due regard for labor stand\nards, wages and other conditions in\nparticular localities; the right of all\nworkers to \' a living wage, insuring\nhealth and reasonable comforts.\nFelix Frankfurter, chairman of the\nwar labor policies board, makes this\nfurther explanation of the resolution\nof the board setting forth its princi\nples : “Inasmuch as wage stability was\nrecognized as the essential need by\nlabor and by the government the pur\npose of the resolution was to prevent\nchanges in the standards which had\nbeen created either through an adjust\nment board such as the labor wage ad\njustment board of the emergency fleet\ncorporation, or the arsenal and navy\nyard standards, or the standards which\ngovern the cantonment adjustment\nboard, but urtder no circumstances was\nit intended to prevent the lifting of\nwage scales in specific instances up to\nthe standards.”\nThere were no aerial bombing or\nganizations In the allied flying corps\nduring the first year of the war. Prac\ntically all the work In the air was in\nthe nature of observation. No pilots\ncould be spared for anything else. To\nday probably 25 per Cent of the "“rial\narms are bombing squadrons of 12\nmachines per squadron.\nThe first bombing was done by vol\nunteer pilots who flew over the Ger\nman lines and dropped three or four\nbombs, made from artillery shells, on\nconcentration camps and cantonments.\nShowers of small steel arrows were\nspilled sometimes on convoys, troop\ntrains and bodies of massed men. The\nGermans began day bombing of cities\nin 1915, and the allies bombarded\nKarlsruhe in reprisal later In the same\nyear. Since then evolution in organ\nized bombing developed rapidly and\nthe French began night bombing, but\nthis was not undertaken by the Ger\nmans until August, 1916.\nAt the present time large groups,\nIncluding several squadrons of bomb\ning machines, go over the lines from\ntime to time and completely destroy\ntheir objective, be it a city or a camp,\na column of troops or a trench system.\nUnfortunately the allies’ air forces\nhave to travel for many miles over\nhostile territory defended by anti\naircraft guns to attack Germa ncitles,\nwhile the enemy can attack Frencli\ncities by flying only a short distance\nbeyond the allied lines.\nThe allies are developing large\nbombing planes which carry sufficient\nfuel for long excursions and armament\nto protect them when they are at\ntacked by fighting airplanes. Bombing\nsquadrons are escorted usually over\nthe lines by fast fighting squadrons\nof 18 planes to a squadron, and then\nleft to their own devices, for the fight\ners seldom carry sufficient fuel to per\nmit them to accompany the bombers\non the round trip.\nThe dropping of the bomb is simi\nlar to shooting a rifle. First you set\nyour sights and wind gauge, you hold\nthe rifle properly, and finally you pull\nthe trigger at the proper moment. If\nyour ammunition Is standard your\nsights correct, you hit the target. So\nwith bombing. If you set your sights\ncorrectly, fly your plane correctly over\nthe objective and drop the bomb at the\nproper time you will hit the target. If\nthe ammunition manufacturers gave\nyou good bombs the objective will be\ndestroyed.\nThe United States will be short of\npotash next year. Estimates for 1918\nshow an available supply of about\n500,000 tons of potash salts, or only\nabout half of the normal imports be\nfore the war. Commercial fertilizer\nconcerns must bear the brunt of the\nshortage.\nThe army needs straw, says the bu\nreau of markets, department of agri\nculture. Farmers are urged to bale\nthe straw immediately after thrash\ning, and the bureau of markets will\nhelp to market it if asked.\n, ■The need of platinum in war indus\n! tries and in the sciences Is explained\nby Dr. Charles L. Parsons, chief chem\nist. bureau of mines, department of the\nI interior, in an argument for discontinu\nance of the use of platinum in jewelry.\n“The war cannot be won without\nplatinum,” says Doctor Parsons, “and\nit is equally essential in times of peace\n> if our country is to excel Germany In\nthe development of chemical science\nand industry. With the aid of plati\nnum from one ordinary wedding ring\nabout 100 pounds of nitric acid can be\nmade every 24 hours. This 100 pounds\nof nitric acid converted into high ex\nplosives will send a number of three\ni Inch shells against the Germans and\nt help to bring the boys back home,\nj “Platinum rings, pins, cigarette\n, cases, and mesh bags are not factors\nj in winning this war—explosives are. 1\n( wonder if the purchasers and wearers\n. of platinum jewelry know that explo\n-3 sives cannot be manufactured without\n, the use of sulphuric and nitric acids;\n, that the manufacture of these acids re\n; quires the use of supplies of platinum;\n. that airplanes must have platinum for\n, important instruments they need; that\nplatinum is absolutely necessary in the\n3 manufacture of special pyrometers;\nI that pyrometers are necessary in all\nsteel treatments; and that no guns can\n- be made without the use of pyrometers.\n, | “There is a shortage in the supply of\n, platinum. Russia has a corner on the\n. world’s supply, and Germany is in Rus\n. sia. Our domestic production of plati\ni num is negligible, while our military\nrequirements are increasing at a rapid\n■ , rate.”\nMany housewives have learned from\n\' sad experiences in loss of perishable\n. foods that next to the ice is not the\ncoldest place in the home refrigerator.\nTo the housewife who has not had this\n‘ experience the food administration\ngives this advice:\n[ | “Many put their butter and milk\n. j right next to the ice because they\n[ think this is the coldest place, but, ns\nI a matter of fact, the coldest place is\n, at the bottom of the refrigerator. Hot\nair rises and air that is not being con\n, stantly purified by circulation around\n, the blocks of ice soon is unfit to\ni come into contact with the food.\nWhen the warm air in the refrigera\n, tor rises it carries with it impurities\n, and moisture which are absorbed from\n, 1 the surface of the food and which if\nallowed to remain in the air spoil\nj the food. The air which is warmed by\npassing over the food comes in con\ntact with the ice, where the moisture\nIs condensed upon the surface and the\nimpurities are carried off by the melt\ning ice. The air is thus dried, cooled\nand purified. The cooled air immedi\n| ntely descends to gather up more mois\n, ture and impurities and thus the\n| process is repeated continually.\n“It is advisable to allow heated food\nto cool off before placing it in the re\nfrigerator. If put in when warm it\nraises the temperature of the refriger\n\' ator higher than it should go and\nmelts ice unnecessarily. The trapdoor\nthrough which the meltnge passes out\nat the bottom of the refrigerator\nshould be kept in place, because if it\n, is broken or lost a constant stream of\nwarm air is allowed to flow into the\nrefrigerator.”\nThe war department has opened a\ngreat storage lumber depot at Gilmer\nton, Va., to meet emergency demands\nof the army for lumber. Through its\n1 operation It is estimated that a yearly\n1 saving of approximately $250,000 will\nbe effected.\n1 Whenever army constructors in the\npast were required to buy additional\nlumber the purchases were made at\nyards in the immediate vicinity. The\naverage increase in price for this ma\nterial over the lumber originally pur\nchased for the job would run from $9\nto sl2 per 1,000 feet. By purchasing\nin large quantities and charging only\nfor yard maintenance the greater part\nof this excess price is expected to be\nsaved to the government.\nA stock of from twelve to fifteen\nmillion feet of lumber will be carried,\nand it is estimated that the yearly\nturnover will amount to between fifty\nI and sixty million feet. A fund of\n$500,000 lias been set aside by the war\ndepartment for use by the construc\ntion division of the army as necessary\nworking capital for the yard.\nThe supply of kerosene will run\nshort next winter and the government\nis urging every user to do his part\ntoward making every gallon to do full\nwar duty by giving forth Its full\nmeasure of light and heat. Saving can\nbe accomplished, it is said, only If\ncare is given lamps, lanterns, heaters\nand stoves.\nThe director of oil conservation of\n| the United States fuel administration\nissues these rules for fuel-oil saving:\nKe£p all lamps and lanterns clean.\nLet the light out; don’t confine it be\nhind smoked and dirty chimneys.\n1 i See that burners and wicks of all\noil-burning devices are clean. Clean\ni burners require less oil and give bet\nter lights.\nDon’t allow a lamp, lantern, heater\nor stove to burn a minute longer than\n’ is necessary. Don’t light one you can\ni do without.\nDon’t use coal oil for cleaning pur\nposes. Hot water will do the work.\nGirls are helping in airplane produc\ntion by splicing cables and in other\nways, according to H. E.

Six of Them.\n“My six boys are safe in bed,” cheerfully the kaiser said.\n“Safe and sound they sleep and snore, while the world is splash\ned with gore. German angels fuard their sleep, which is restfui,\ncalm and deep; smiles upon their faces burst, as they dream of\nweiner wurst. Some men’s sons, I have told, lie in couches wet\nand cold, all their clothing wet with blood; plastered\' o’er with\nmuck and mud. That would be a beastly fix; I am thankful that\nmy six sleep in peace and comfort here, dreaming of a keg of beer.\nEitel Fritz and William Fred, each is in his truckle bed, each se\ncurely in his cot, guarded by our German Gott. I’ve been told\nthat some men’s son- 5 , shattered by the foemen’s guns, have beer\ncast in trenches deep, there to find their endless sleep. Then I\nview my kraut-fed boys; painless sleep each one enjoys; six fat\nprinces in a row; where do smother princes grow? German\nseraphim at> nigh! Sleep, my sons, while others die! Sleep\nwhile boys of coarser blood groan and perish in the mud! All the\nworld is full of groans, all the world is white with bones, all the\nworld is wet with tears, racked with anguish a.id with fears, and j\nhow thankful I should be, that my sons are here with me, while\nthe globe is throwing fits—Wilhelm Fred and Eitel Fritz!”\nCopyright 1918 by George Matthew Adams.\no\nDOUBLY SHOCKING.\nThe energy expended in taking off and putting on automo\nbile tires in the hot dusty road during these warm days would i\nshock a lot of hay.—Buckeye Valley News.\nAnd the profanity expended would shock a regiment of sol\ndiers.\no\nAll maried men will tell you that before they married they;\nexpected to have their own way in the household. After mar\nriage very few will admit they do not. And when they do so ad\nmit the admission is laughed down as camouflage.\nOnly one lone and solitary republican has announced’ him-!\nself as an aspirant for a county office in Santa Cruz this yeai\\ i\nOfficial plums seem to be hanging too high for the republicans\nto hope to reach them.\nv\nAmerica is pouring out her money and blood like water to\nthe end that never shall be another Hohenzollem seated upon the\nthrone of the German Empire.\no\nA just retribution would put the hangman’s noose about the\nnecks of the Kaiser, the Crown Prince, von Hindenburg, and oth\ners who can be named.\nn *\nLet today be a holiday in Nogales. All the people will turn\nout to do honor to the gallent Thirty-fifth.\n■< i ■■■\nThere are many reasons why Nogales regrets to part with the\nofficers and men of the 35th Infantry.\n■ i>\nWould be progresseive people forget sometimes that a freight\ntrain makes more noisetha’i a fast express.\no\nVery few men would care to have the voter take them at\ntheir own expressed estimate.\no\nBut for the fools in the world wise men would have to work\nfor their living.\no\n*,Money talks,” but it does not always speak when spoken to.\nn\nJ Heathen seldom waste their time quarreling over religion.\nTO KAISER BILL.\nWe are coming, Kaiser Bill\nFive thousand thousand strong,\n’ And if those millions not enough,\nStill more will come along.\nThe Boys in blue are always true,\nThe Boys in brown are brave,\nThe Huns they meet will ever rue\nThe race they thought to slave.\nYes, we’re coming Kaiser Bill,\nWith cannon, planes and guns,\nTo fight for peace and rights of men,\nAnd overthrow your Huns.\nThe brutal Hosts whom you have taught\nTo murder in God’ name,\nTo rape and rob in name of God,\nYet say you serve the same.\nBut they’ll be stopped in their career,\nAnd forced back o’er the Rhine,\nOr buried in the land of France,\nIn holes of shell and mine.\nOn to Berlin our men will speed,\nWith the Stars and Stripes on high,\nAnd o’er the Castles of Berlin,\nThe Allied flags will fly.\nv • —DR. A. H. NOON,\nHurrah for the gallant 35th, count them all in, and good luck\nbe with them, so say we all. A. H. N.\n" - -*■-\nChildren’s Frocks for Late Summer\nFor late summer and early fall wear\nthe choice of fabrics for children’s\nIressy frocks narrows down, as sheer\ngoods are more or less eliminated from\n:alculation. Wool has advanced until\nit has reached a point where silk may\n>e considered on a par with it, so far\nis economy is concerned. For this and\nfor patriotic reasons, the little miss\nnay as well go In silk attire as In any\nthing else.\nAmong the new model dresses there\nire taffetas, crepe de chine and fou\nlards. The taffetas are shown in plain\n:olors and in narrow stripes, the crepe\nle chine In uniformly plain colors\nind the foulards, with medium dark\ngrounds, have small figures in white or\nn white and colors printed on them.\nBut, of all silks, the taffetas fill the\n•equirements of children’s dress in\nhe best manner. One of the prettiest\naffetas is shown above and Is an ex\ncellent example of good designing.\nThis frock has a skirt in which the\n’ullness is arranged in five box plaits.\n:t is set on to a short bodice, and by\nvay of ornament it has suspenders of\nillk over the shoulders. They are\nNOGALES, ARIZONA,.. WEDNESDAY, AUG. 7, 1918\nsplit near the ends, where they extend\nbelow the bodice and fasten to the\nskirt with flat pearl buttons. Small\nsilk-covered buttons might be substi\ntuted for these. This dress Is In porce\nlain-blue taffeta, but the same design\nlooks well in tan or brown, and in any\ncase the French knots that provide the\nfinishing touch are made of black silk\ntwist.\nThere are some heavy cotton crepes,\nin all the attractive colors of silks,\nthat will prove interesting as substi\ntutes for wool frocks, when the time\narrives to get school clothes ready.\nAll dresses are simply made, with\nfancy stitching and French knots, or\nvery simple embroidery providing their\nmeager decorations. White organdie\ncollars, and sometimes undersleeves of\norgandie, prove a means of freshening\nup these childish frocks.\nSliver gauze and silver net make a\nwonderful evening dress for summer.\nLocal and Personal\nLamar Cobb, candidate for\nthe democratic nomination for\ngovernor, will speak at the city\npark at 8 o’clock tonight. Cobb\nsays “there are more ablebodied\nmen in Arizona than I—but\nthey are not running for gover\nnor.”\nCapt. A. V. Smelker, medical\ncorps U. S. A., received yester\nlay a telegram from the depart\nment of which he is attached,\ninstructing him to proceed to\nCamp Travis, near San Antonie,\nTexas, and report there for ser\nvice in the base hospital.\nMonday night there came\nfrom Empalme Messrs. H. J,\nTemple and James B. Finley,\ngeneral superintendent and as\nsistant superintendent respect\nively of the Southern Pacific of\nMexico. Mr. Finley was en\nroute to California, where he\nwent yesterday.\nFrom Hermosillo it is report\ned that the foundry and ma\nchine shop of the Fundicioh de\nSonora, which suspended opera\ntion when the revolutionary\ntroubles unsettle the country,is\nabout to resume operation, Don\nVictor Aguilar is the president\nof ihe corporation, and h\'s son\nMr. Jose Aguilar, is manager.\nMiss Maria Parra and Mr.\nFred Sanchez were married\nMonday efternoon by Justice of\nthe Peace J. N. Wilkey, at the\ncourt house of Nogales. They\nwill begin housekeeping in the\nhome just completed by Mr.\nSanchez in Nogales, Sonora.\nMr. Sanchez is well known to\nmany in Nogales, as he has been\nemployed by the Nogales Gro\ncery Co. for some time past, in!\nwhich position he has made\nmany friends.\nAn Active Aspirant\nThis week Nogales has enter\ntained Hon. Lamar Cobb, for\nmer state engineer, who is an\naspirant for the democratic\nnomination for governor, and is\'\nhere “looking after his fences.” j\nMr. Cobb was announced for,\na speech in the park after the\'\nband concert yesterday evening.\nbut the heavy rain shower not\nonly headed off the concert but\nliterally threw a wet blanket,\nupon Mr. Cobb’s speech.\nFeeling that some amends\nshould be made for the unkind\nness of J. Pluvius toward the\ngentleman The Oasis takes this\nway for saying a good word for\nhim (“all rights reserved” to\nquote the nofelists.)\nMr. Cobb made a fine record\nas state engineer. He built\nbridges and roads in all parts\nof the state. In this county he\nmade the Santa Cruz river\nbridge and the Tucson highway.\nShould he become governor he\nwill doubtless make good in that\noffice.\nMr. Cobb will speak this eve\nning from the band stand in the\npark, beginning his remarks at\n8 o’clock.\nIf you see a good, strong,\nsteady, bright, white electric\nlight, it is ours.
