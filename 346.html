MONROE 353\nVOL.2,N0.82 Chicago, Saturday, Jan. 4, 1913 ONE CENT\nTHE STRANGE HAPPENINGS IN THE PRIVATE\nOFFICE OF MARSHALL FIELD & CO\nHow Were Six Documents, Authorizing Outlawry,\nSecured From Two Young Girls By Ben\nHinckley and Mike McGuire.\nIf two girls are accused of de\nfrauding a big department store,\nAnd are taken to a private of\nfice in that department store and\nput through a third degree with\nout authority of law,\nAnd if at the end of the third\ndegree the big department store\nis able to produce the following\nthree documents signed by each\nof the girls :\nOne "order" delivering money\nto the department store,\nOne authority to the depart\nment store to ransack the girls\'\nhome,\nAnd one "confession,"\nWouldn\'t it suggest that some\nthing mighty funny had\' happen\ned in that private office of the big\ndepartment store?\nThe big department store in\nvolved in the case is that "great\nest of Chicago institutions," Mar\nshall Field & Co.\nThe two girls are Hazel\nKrause, 22 years old, and Estelle\nYaeger, 21 years old.\nThe private office in which the\ndocuments were obtained was\nthat of Michael J. Ford, superin\ntendent of Marshall Field & Co.\nThe other occupants of that of\nfice af the time the documents\nwere obtained were Ren C. Hinck\nlev, assistant superintendent of\nMarshall .Field & Co.. and Mikt\nMcGuire, private "detective."\nJust what happened in that\nroom is pretty much of a mystery.\nRut this much is certain.\nHazel Krause was a sales\nwoman for Marshall Field & Co.\nEstelle Yaeger was her friend.\nEstelle Yaeger went into the\nstore one day to return a couple\nof waists. \'\nThe saleswoman noticed some\nthing wrong with the return\ncheck and called it to the atten\ntion of Hinckley.\nHinckley ordered Miss Yaeger', 'brought to his private office. Mike\nMcGuire was there.\nThe two men put Miss Yaeger\nthrough a third degree, asking\nher where her home was, who her\nparents were, what references she\ncould give and so on.\nAs one reference, Miss Yaeger\nmentioned the name of her friend,\nMiss Krause.\nHinckley sent for Miss Krause\nand accused\'her of complicity in\ntheft when she appeared.\nAlso, he and Mike McGuire\nlabored with her until they were\nable to obtain from Miss Yaeger\nand Miss Krause those three\nstrange documents.\nIt may be that Miss Yaeger and\nMiss Krause were guilty it may\nbe, but that hardly has much to\ndo with it.\nThat did not excuse the secur\ning of the document "delivering"\nall the girls\' money to Marshall\nField & Co.\nThat did not excuse the secur\ning of the document on the\nstrength of which Mike McGuire f\nand his men ransacked the girls\'\nhome from top to bottom and\ntook away every article of cloth\ning they could lay their hands on.\nThat did not excuse the secur\ning of that "voluntary" confes\nsion to theft.\nIt probably would be quite in\nteresting to learn just what did\nhappen in that private office of\nMichael J. Ford before Marshall\nField secured those six documents.\nTWENTY-SIX HELD IN AUTO BANDIT ROBBERY\nTwenty-six suspects have -been\na rested in connection with the\nhi test outrage of the auto ban\ndits, who yesterday afternoon\nrobbed a Clark street jewelry\nstore, and boldly escaped through\nthe crowded loop district, captur\ning a policeman at one of the\ncity\'s busiest corners, slugging\nhim, throwirtg him to the street\nand shooting him, during their\nflight.\nThe captured men will be taken\nbefore Traffic Policeman Freder\nick Sticken, who was shot, for\nidentification. Sticken gave an ac\ncurate description of the four\nmen. with whom he rode for sev\neral blocks.\nTwo of the men were arrested\nin East Chicago. They gave the\nnames of Q\'Brien and Brady. A\nI rrlTr- oAnfoinitin\' lif pmntv\na v. v -i ,isw laitinic kin v-v- vmpij\nshells was found on Brady. Three\nshots were fired at Sticken, one\ntaking effect in his leg, and an\nother grazing his head.\nLast night\'s hold-up was the\nclimax of a month of terrorism by .\nthe auto bandits. The four men\nstole the auto from in front of an\noffice building on W. Jackson\nboulevard.\nThey drove to the jewelry store\nof Berman Stein, 667 N. Clark\nstreet. Two of the men alighted\nfrom the car. Each threw a brick\nthrough the plate glass show\nwindows, grabbed a tray of dia-.\nmonds, and ran to the machine.\nLieut. Culnane and Sergt. Mc\nGuire heard the crash, got a taxi,\nand pursued the bandits.\nThe bandit car sped toward the I', 'loop district. In the maze of\ntraffic it quickly lost its pursuers.\nAt the corner of Wabash and\nMonroe, Policeman Sticken no\nticed there was no tail light on\nthe machine and ordered the men\nto halt. Re entered the machine\nand told them to drive to the First\nprecinct station on LaSalle street.\nThe chauffeur started the car\nwest on Monroe street. At State\none of the bandits jumped -from\nthe car. Sticken. knowing- noth\ning\' of the robbery, did not-pursue\nhim. When the. auto reached La\nSalle street, Sticken ordered the\ndriver to turn north. Instead he\ncontinued to Fifth avenue.\nWhen halfway between Mon\nroe and Madison streets on Fifth\navenue, one of the bandits slug\nged the policeman over the head\nwith a -blackjack. Another push\ned him from the car. Sticken fell\non his head, and was dazed for an\ninstant.\nCalmly standing on the run\nning board, one of the bandits\nfired three times at the prostrate\nofficer. Sticken returned the fire.\nHe was injured in the fleshy part\nof the thigh. After wounding\nthe policeman the bandit ran into\nan alley and escaped.\nThe second bandit deserted the\ncar and fled down Fifth avenue,\nfiring at pedestrians. After his.\ntwo pals had escaped the chauf\nfeur boldly drove past the cross\ning officer at Madison and Fifth\navenue. The noise of elevated\ntrains had prevented this police\nman hearing the shooting.\nA big crowd gathered around\nSticken. It was then that the\nother policeman learned what\nhad happened. He pursued the\nauto, which was rapidly disap\npearing up Fifth avenue. At\nWater street it was found stand\ning against the curb. The chauf\nfeur had escaped.\no o-\nHERO OF FIRST TRIPLE PLAY WORKS FOR UNCLE SAM\nHolding a good position in the\ndepartment of agriculture, Wash\nington, D. C, is a blonde individ\nual of comfortable flesh, who an\nswers to the name of Paul A.\nHines.\nHe is the hero of the first unas\nsisted triple play in baseball the\nPaul Hines of the Prpvidence\nGrays in the days of "Old Hoss"\nRadbourne the mighty pitcher;\nof Manager Frank C. Bancroft,\nnow business manager of the Cin\ncinnati Reds.\nWell preserved, genial, a com\nfortable looking business man,\nPaul A. Hines little resembles the\ndashing outfielder of three dec\nades ago.\nHines is at home in Washing\nton. He was born there 57 years\nago, and when he closed his base\nball career it was natural to re\nturn to the district whose citi\nzens have no more franchise than\na kill-i-loo bird.\nHines began his baseball ca\nreer in 1870 with the pld Nation\nals of Washington and for three\nyears played with this club. Then\nhe joined the Chicago White\nStockings and from 1874 to 1877\nwas one of that great wrecking\ncrew.', 'Hines, when he left Chicago,\njoined the famous Providence\nGrays, one of the greatest\' com\nbinations that ever-appeared upon\na ball field. With them he play\ned from 1878 to 1885, when he\nreturned to Washington for two\nyears before going to Indian\napolis. Providence, under the manage\nment of Bancroft, was some base\nball club. In 1884 Radbourne\npitched 12 games and that year\nB\nPaul Hines.\nHines batted .304 and fielded\n.895.\nHines was a wonderful fielder\nand a natural hitter. He led all\ncenter fielders in 1874, 1880, 1883\nand 1884. Between 1876 and 1889\nhe batted .300 for nine seasons,\nand from 1876 to 1885 was the\nAll-American center fielder.\nWith Pittsburg in 1890, Hines\nplayed first base, which position\nhe had played with Indianapolis,\nIt may be hard for the fans to\nbelieve, as Hines does, that the\ngame is no faster now than when\nhe played, but read his own\nwords upon the subject:\n"We did everything 30 years\nago they do today, with the pos\nsible exception of sacrificing. Lit\ntle of that was done, and I con\nsider the game was better."\nRegarding his famous triple\nplay when with Providence Hines\nwrites:\n"It was made May 8, 1878. I\nwas playing a deep center field\nand there were two runners on\nsecond and third when a short\nfly was hit over second base.\n\'\'I. ran in after the ball, be\nlieving I had the speed to reach\nit, for I was pretty fast in those\ndays. Both base runners thought\nthe ball would fall safe, and ran\nfor the plate.\n"I got the ball off my instep,\nnear second, touched the base\nand then ran to third, reaching\nthat base before the runner who\nhad occupied it could return,\nthus completing the play.\n"The play has been questioned,\nbut I see that Umpire Daniels,\nwho worked that day, vouched\nfor it recently.\n"Of course I remember dis\ntinctly how the crowd, when it\nrealized what had happened,\nwent wild. It was one of the\nproudest moments in the life of\nPaul Hines, I tell you."\nOn some of the large Atlantic\nsteamers there are as many as 150\nfiremen.', 'HONEYMOON CAMPAIGN CAUSED ELECTION OF THE\nYOUNGEST CONGRESSMAN\nr"v, \'lis\nB k A V .H\nMr. and Mrs. Clyde H. Tavenner.\nOf course, "Tav" says that he\ndid it; good speaking, warm\nhandshaking and all that, but\nWashington knows better. It was\nMrs. Tav who did it elected her\nhusband to the house of repre\nsentatives as the baby member of\nthe next congress.\nAt the capital, where Mrs.\nClyde H. Tavenner used to be\none of Senator Bob LaFollette\'s\nsecretaries, everybody says that\nshe did the most towards turning\nfin erstwhile strongly Republican\nmajority into a Democratic ma\njority of 1,200.\nTo be sure, Clyde H. Traven\nner helped the movement along\nwith some mighty argumentive\nspeeches and hob-nobbing with\nthe sens of toil back in the four\nteenth Illinois district.\nBut if Tav hadn\'t been mar\nried to the then Miss Isabel Mar\ntin on the 17th of July last the\nchances are that he would spend\nthe next two years press-agent-ing\nthe Democratic majority in', 'the house and drawing pay as as\nsistant sergeant-at-arms.\nWnen the young bridegroom,\nyoung congressman-elect, was in\nthe newspaper game he was just\nplain Tav and pounded copy out\nof a typewriter, and once he\nwrote a gem of a story about\nhow young men sh6uld remain\nsingle until they get a strangle\nhold on fame. Then he met Miss\nMartin. And the wedding fol\nlowed. But the bride had start\ned Tav upward, politically speak\ning, during their late courting\nhours.\nInstead of saying sweet noth\nings to each other, as is the wont\nof most engaged folks, Tav and\nhis "best girl that ever lived"\nplanned a political campaign. The\nbridegroom-to-be was told to\nhurry back to Cordova, 111., and\ntake a Democratic nomination\n\' that nobody else wanted, because\nthe district was always Republi\ncan. With the nomination in one\nhand and a wedding ring in the\nother, Tav hustled back to Wash\nington. After the ceremony the\nyoung couple packed a trunk and\nmade a bee-line for Rock Island,\nI.I., where they opened head\nquarters, of which Mrs. Tav took\ncharge.\nTav wasn\'t- allowed to dilly\ndally around making love. Oh,\nno. The young bride marched\nhim right out and sent him\nthrough the rural districts to\ngarner the votes while she sup\nplemented his arguments with\nsome of her own mailed to voters.\nAnd the Rock Island district i\nwill have the youngest member\nof the next congress, and the\nyoungest matron in the congres\nsional set, the same being Con\ngresman Tavenner and Mrs. Tav\nenner age 20.\no o\nMERELY COMMENT\nThose reformers who were\ntalking so much about impeach\ning Mayor Harrison over the\nNew Year\'s eve "orgy" have now\ndropped the idea.\nOne of the best things some re\nformers seem to do is to talk big\nand then blow up with a loud\nbang when the time for action\ncomes.\nGary, Ind., has decided to try\nthe golden rule and take drunk\nards home in cabs instead of ar\nresting them.\nGary has been progressing rap\nidly since the bright day it gave\nHit de Pipe Heitler a hint that his\npresence there was no longer wel\ncome. No wonder auto bandits escape\nmost of the cops are being kept\nbusy worrying about reorganiza\ntion schemes and perjury talks.\nAnd so, after all, Uncle Sam\nhasn\'t got the nerve to go after\nWilliam Rockefeller, fugitive\nfrom justice, with an axe.\nIt seems a pity that the old\ngent who licked the stuffing out\nof England on two separate occa\nsions, and who messed up the At\nlantic and Pacific\' oceans with\nwhat was left of Spain, should be\nso scared of a Standard Oil king.\no o\nWhistles were first used -by ref\nerees in football matches in 1878.', 'OUTBURSTS OF EVERETT TRUE\nN\nN\n3S,\'r t, fverr sr-\no o\nHE WAS A SAILOR\nA sailor who had landed after\na long voyage and, having been\npaid off, called a cab, threw his\nluggage inside and jumped on top\nhimself. ,\n"Beg pardon, sir," said the\nastonished cabman, "but you\nshould get inside and put your\nboxes on top."\n"Steer the craft ahead, jarvey.\nPassengers always go on deck\nand luggage in the hold," was the\nreply from the top.\no o\n"I\'d like to make you my wife,"\nsaid the practical young man,\n"but they tell me you can\'t keep\nhouse."

G. Chapman.)\nWhen Peter Carew failed to\npass the entrance examination\nfor West Point everybody knew\nthat he must have failed quite\nbadly, for his father had been\nMajor General Carew, the hero\nof Shitoh, and if any point could\nw \'I I\nSaw Edith and a Man.\nhave been strained to admit\nPeter it would certainly have been\nlone. But then nobody had ex\npected anything; much of Peter.\nPeter w simple; in\nfact, he was endowed with an\namount of plain common sense\nsuperior to the average. But he\nwas so quiet and easily embar-\n\'\' rind had a certain delicacy\nof feeling which is not common\nly associated with army men. Scr\neverybody thought he had found\nhis proper level when he accepted\na position at twenty-five dollars\na week in a stock broker\'s office.\nThe Carews had lost most of\ntheir money in the same specula\ntive enterprise which involved\nColonel Tarrish, the general\'s old\ncomrade in arms. It had always\nbeen expected that Peter would\nmarry Edith. Peter took this as\na matter of course. It was Edith\nwho disillusioned him, and it oc\ncurred just after he entered the\nfirm of Scarborough & Rink.\n"And it\'s only twenty-five to.\nbegin with Edith," said Peter,\nwhen he had finished telling her\nof his new career. He had not\nnoticed the gathering scorn on\nher face. "Do you think you\nwould be willing to wait for me,\ndear?"\nEdith laughed mirthfully and\nthen put her small hands upon\nPeter\'s shoulders and pushed the\nbisr, overgrown boy up against a\ncorner.\n"Peter! T.onk at me!" she com\nmanded. "Why do you, take it for\ngranted that I am going to mar\nry you? Why?\'\n"I don\'t know," stammered\nPeter, miserably. "My father and\nthe colonel always intended it, I\nsuppose."\n"Well. Peter, you will have to\nlearn that a woman has-a will of\nher own and isn\'t given away like\na premium of tea," said Edith.\nAnd really Peter had behaved\nvery badly more like a booby\nthan a man. But that\' was just\nPeter\'s way of doing things; that', 'was why people thought he was\nsimple.\n"I guess that Tarrish girl will\nbe getting marric1 to Captain\nFramley now that she has given\nyoung Carew the mitten," the\ngossips of Loganville said to one\nanother expressively. "If Peter\nhadn\'t been such a fool well,\nyo couldn\'t expect a high-spirited\nyoung woman like her to mar\nry any but an army man !"\n"-She\'ll have to get married\npretty soon, I reckon," would\ncome the answer. "That three\nthousand insurance the colonel\nleft won\'t last forever. They say\nshe\'s living on the principal. It\'ll\nlast less than a year at the rate\nshe\'s spending it."\nThereafter the old house was\ngay with company; army men,\nmostly, though sometimes men\nlike Peter came and stayed and\nwent away not to return. Cap\ntain Framley belonged to the\nfastest set in the garrison but\nEdith knew nothing about that.\nShe .only knew that they were\nfascinating and daring and yet\nrespectful. And in all but the last\nquality how different from Peter !\nAnybody but a simpleton like\nPeter would have stayed away,\nbut Peter came just the same, and\nif he came less often he was just\nas polite, just as amiably interest\ned as before. Sometimes the gar\nrison officers made fun of him,\nbut only in a sly manner. Some\nhow Peter had a lurking quality\nin him, a subdued power in his\n"" mild blue eyes that instinctively\nmade itself felt. Xobody would\nhave cared to affront six feet of J\nkeyed-up humanity like Pete?\nCarew.\nWhen people saw that Peter\ndid not take his rebuff, the news\nof which was common property,\nthey grinned again, but Peter had\na reason which he kept to him\nself. Peter\'s father had called\nhim to his bedside two hours be\nfore he died.\n"Peter," he said, "that filly of\nthe colonel\'s will take the bit be\ntween her teeth some day and\nbolt. She\'s got all her father\'s\nspirit, and she\'s good and fine;\nbut she ought to have been a boy.\nThere\'s much she doesn\'t know\nyet. Drive her on the snaffle,\nPeter, but hold the curb ready.\nGod bless you, Peter. I wish I\ncould live to see you happily mar\nried." Those were his last words, but\nPeter never forgot them. And\nwhen his illusions faded and he\nbegan to see Edith Tarrish in a\nclearer light, he felt, though he\ncould not have expressed the feel\ning, that it was his duty to pro\ntect and aid her, if ever she need\ned his aid, and that because the\ncolonel had been his father\'s\nclosest friend, so he must be\nEdith\'s.\nAnd then the day came when\nhe knew he must aid her against\nherself.\nIt happened unexpectedly, as\nmost things of that nature hap\npen. He was approaching the\nhouse at dusk, and, silhouetted\nagainst the shade, he saw Edith\nand a man. He saw the man\nraise Edith\'s hand to his lips and\nhold it there. And the man was', 'i II i j u 4 mmv 9a&mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmii\nCaptain Framley.\nHe knew Framley to be a man\nof no moral perception, but he\ndid not know then that his wife\nhad been in an asylum, an incur\nable madwoman, for years. No\nbody knew of poor Mrs. Fram\nley, for it was not to the captain\'s\nadvantage to proclaim this fact.\nIf Peter had known but as he\ndid not he only tightened his lips\nand rang the bell. As he did so\nthe shadows started away.\n"O, so you\'ve come again,\nPeter!" said Edith, wearily, when\nhe was shown in; and anybody\nbut Peter would have walked out\nagain. Peter did not walk out,\nhowever. He sat down in an up\nright hard-bottomed chair, with\nhis hat on his knees, and answer\ned only in monosyllables when\nthey spoke to him, and refused to\nperceive all the hints that were\nplentifully fiur.g to him. So\nafter two hours of this the cap\ntain savagely made his adieux.\nWhen he was gone Peter turned\nto Edith.\n"I don\'t want you to admit\nCaptain Framley to your house\nagain, Edith,\'\' said Peter, mildly.\nEdith looked at him and could\nnot understand. This seemed a\ndifferent Peter from the one she\nhad known. So she flew into a\npassion.\n\'\'How dare you, Peter!" she\nstormed. \'\'Who are you to lay\ndown the law to me? What\nright have you?"\n"Captain Framley is not fit for\nyour acquaintance, Edith," said\nPeter. That was all that he said,\nout somehow Edith knew that he\nhad witnessed the scene by the\nwindow.\n"And suppose he isn\'t?" she\nasked. "What right have you to\ntell me so?"\n"I have the right," said Peter,\n"because there is nobody else to\nclaim it." fjf\n.nuw mucn uu yuu cam,\nPeter?" asked Edith, quietly.\n"Twenty-five dollars a week, isn\'t\nit?"\n"No, thirty," answered Peter.\n"They raised me five last month.\nWhy?"\n"Because," answered Edith,\n"you don\'t seem to me to have\nmade such a success of your own\nlife that you can afford to take\ncharge of mine."\nPeter went away, but he came\nback again. Edith stormed and\nmocked and jeered at him. But\nPeter was not to be thwarted.\nHe was resolved to save Edith\nfrom herself, for he knew that she\nhad the bit between her teeth\nand was running away, just as his\nfather had foretold.\nHe learned about Mrs. Fram\nley quite by accident. An ill\nwisher of the captain told him,\nand when Peter learned of it he\nwas very thoughtful. He knew\nthat it would do Edith no good\nif he were to blurt out the fact to\nher in his simple fashion. Loyal- n\n,- t7j:u ..4. . ..i:4....\nl W13 JU1I.1I 3 SllUllgCSl IjUdlllV ,\nshe would have refused to believe\nhim, would have asked Framley\nhimself. He would save Edith,\ne- en if it meant his own death.\nSo he unbuckled his father\'s old\narmy holster, took out his pistol\nand slipped a single cartridge in-\nliMMMMlMMlAMMaM,', 'tide. Then he went to Framley\'s\nquarters. He had not been there\nbefore, and it was two weeks\nsince he had seen Edith.\n"Cap\'n Framley, sir?" inquir\ned the colored attendant in sur\nprise. "Cap\'n Framley\'s done\nresigned, sir, and going west.\nft He\'ll never come back no more,\nsir."\n"Thanks," said Peter. "When\nis he going? and from where?"\n"I don\'t exactly know, sir," an\nswered the man, "but I done\nheard him say he\'s gone to New\nYork first, sir."\nThat was all Peter could learn.\nSo, having no other course in\nmind, he went to Edith\'s house.\nAs he walked up the garden path\nhe noticed that the shades were\ndrawn, and a dreadful fear assail\ned him.\n"Miss Edith\'s gone away, Mr.\nCarew," said the maid. "She left\nfor New York yesterday, sir. She\nleft a letter for you, Mr. Carew, in\ncase you called."\nShe brought it to him, and pres\nently Peter was reading it.\n"My dear, dear Peter," it ran.\n"When you read this I shall be\nfar away and never to come back.\nI am going with the man I love.\nYou thought me happy and wil\nful, but I was only wanting to be\nloved, as every woman wants,\nft and he loves me as no-one else\ncould do. Yes, you know who\nhe is, Pet?r, and you may know\nmore, but though he has no right\nto make me his wife I love him\nnone the less. O, Peter, if you\nhad not been so slow ! If you had\nmade me love you instead of let\nting me send you away! Good\nbye, and forget me, Peter."\nThere "was much more, half in\ncoherent, and half unintelligible,\nand the letter was blurred as\nthough by tears.\nPeter first tore the letter into\ntiny pieces and let them fly away\none by one. Then he took train\nfor New York. He knew that\nthere were three or four lines\nleading west, and his chance of\nintercepting them was at the\nminimum. But the simple have\nluck, they say. and so it came that\nPeter met Captain Framley fum\ning and fretting in the Occidental\nwaiting room half an hour before\nthe train started. They saw each\nother simultaneously and the\ncaptain got out his question just\nin time to stop Peter\'s mouth.\n"Where is Miss Tarrish?" he\nasked. Peters\' heart gave a great\nbound then, for he knew that they\nhad not met since each left Long\nville alone.\n"If you have kept Miss Tar\nrish from me," said Captain\nFramley, "if you have gone to her\nwith any lying tales, I will beat\nyou like a cur." The captain\nraised the lithe Malacca cane\nwhich he carried and advanced\nthreateningly, his face distorted\nwith passion.\n"Captain Framley," said Peter\nmildly, while he fumbled with\nwhat lay in his coat pocket, "you\nwill go home and never see Miss\nTarrish again. I don\'t want to\nharm one of your kind ; you are\nfollowing your own nature, but\nhere s where you stop. Face\n.about and quick march 1"', '"Why, yotf unutterable simple\nton," sneered the other, "Edith\nknows all about what you know\nof me, and she-doesn\'t care. She\'s\nnot such a boob as to mind a lit\ntle thing like that. Why, she\nasked me to take her "\nAn instant later Peter was\nthrashing Captain Framley with\nhis own Malacca, and with all the\nstrength of his powerful arms. It\nonly lasted fifteen seconds, and\nbefore a crowd could gather\nPeter had flung the bruised wreck\nto the ground and hurled the\nbroken cane at him. And just then\nEdith came into the waiting room\nand she was the first person Peter\nsaw.\nHe drew out his card case and\nthrew a card upon the ground :\nthen he turned and gave Edith\nhis arm. "Stand back, gentle\nmen," he said. "I\'ve only thrash\ned a blackguard. Come Edith!"\nShe stared at him and then at\nthe prostrate man, and then at\nPeter again. And suddenly she\nseemed to understand the true\nPeter, the real Peter that lay be\nneath the simple exterior of the\nman. Quite deliberately she slip\nped her arm through his. and\nthey went out. But afterward.\nwhen they were seated in the cab.\nshe clung to him and cried, and\nPeter, greatly daring, raised her\nhand and kissed it. And then he\nknew that he had conquered at\nlast, because, for the first time,\nhe had driven her on the curb.\nToads become torpid in win\nter and take no food for four or\nsix months.\nDAD\nfAiu l Jtin. rKicr-\nOMfO,C -TN IC,MH SAYS THT IF Wl\nWANT 4NYMC C(,(,i FROM Him m( \'ll\nHUME TO MY ft j?

Not\nwithstanding the facility with\nwhich one may obtain a divorce\nnowadays this man seems to\nthink that a wife is not "for a\nyear and a day." He takes a long\nlook ahead to see how dear little\nO -s\nMiss Billie Burke.\nwifey will look and act when\nthere are "silver threads among\nthe gold."\n"Dear Miss Burke I have\n\' been reading, with much inter\nest, your most helpful letters to\ngirls and I have not wondered at\nyour success in your chosen call\ning when I see how well you\nknow the different characteristics\nof women, how sane and true is\nyour philosophy of life. I am\nnearly 30 years old and I have an\nincome that will support a wife\nand family in comfort, but to tell\nthe truth I am afraid to ask any\nof the girls that I see to marry\nme.\n- "I have met some lovely girls,\nand sometimes I think \'this time\nI have met my fate.\' Then I go\nto see the young woman\'s mother,\nand up to date I have always\nbeen disillusionized.\n"I contend that you can tell\nmore about a girl by observing\nher mother than vou can from\nherself. Did you ever notice the\nmothers of some of the slimr. est\nand daintiest of girls? They arc\nbigger than a hogshead. And yet\nif you asked them they would\ntell you that they, too, were tiny\nlittle things when they were\nyoung. You can easily see that a\nman may marry a slender giri and\nhave a fat wife. So if you don\'t\nlike \'em fat you had better \'look a\nleedleoudt!\'\n"There is another kind of\nmother to whom the man think\ning of marrying should pay close\nattention. If you never see the\ngirl\'s mother except she looks\noverworked and worn ; if you\nknow that the family is in moder\nate circumstances and the girl al\nways has time to go with you and\nhave a good time, even if mother\nhas a headache; if daughter is\ndressed in a dainty dress in the\nmorning and you -see mother\nthrough the door in a gingham\nwrapper and a broom in her hand;\nyou may look ahead to living with\na thoughtless, selfish wife if you\nmarry that kind of a girl. At\nleast, I think so!\n"And then there\'s the girl', 'whose mother has taught her that\nthe only thing of any account is\nthe frivolous entertainment of\nsociety the girl who says \'moth\ner says that I cannot go to the\nparty unless I have a carriage, as\nI will take cold.\' You will find\nthat the father of that girl has his\nnose to the grindstone all the\ntime. The girl would expect her\nhusband to do the same.\n"When I find a girl who looks\ngood to me I immediately begin\no-\n"WE CAUSE MURDERS\nto pay attention to mother, and\nso far I have not found a mother\nwho can measure up with my\nideal my own mother! When I\ndo I\'ll probably buy a license if\nthe daughter will have me."\nWhile this chap is rather cold\nblooded, there is a lot of good\nsense in what he says. Yet I\nhave known a girl who was the\nmost unselfish child in the world,\njust because her stout, selfish\nmother expected so much of her I\no\nBY ALLOWING ORGANIZED\nGREED," SAYS GOVERNOR WEST\nRecently the state of Oregon\nhanged four murderers. Gov.\nOswald West, who is bitterly op-\nGov. Oswald West.\nposed to capital punishment, tried\nto stop official killings by having\nthe people vote whether they\nwanted the condemned men hang\ned or not, but the people turned\nhim down by a 2 to 1 vote. West\nwent ahead with the execution\'s,\nhanging the four inside of two\nhours. Dec. 13, "Bloody Friday"\nthey call it, was the date. In the\nfollowing statement Gov. West\ntells the readers of The Day Book\njust why he is opposed to capital\npunishment.\nBy Oswald West, Governor of\nOregon.\n"This will not prevent crime.\nYou must get at the root of the\nevil." These were the last words\nof one of the condemned men\nand they were to the point.\nI am not opposed to capital\npunishment, as some think, be\ncause I am slopping over with\nsentiment, but because the prac\ntice seems to me to be entirely\nwrong and foolish.\nIf we deliberately, permit or\nganized greed to breed, through\nthe aid of poverty and vice, these\ncriminals and degenerates, are we\nnot in a way responsible for their\nacts? Is not the blood of their\nvictims on our hands as well as', '\'that of the assassin?\nWe spend much time and\nmoney educating the people how\nto select and breed and care for\nlivestock. We impress upon them\nthe fact that only through proper\nselection and care can desirable\nanimals be produced.\nYet we ignore these teachings\nin dealing with our fellow-man,\nfor we not only permit the weak\nminded and degenerate to mate\nand breed at will, but we force\ntheir offspring to grow up amidst\nvice and awful poverty, dwarfed\nmorally, mentally and physi\ncally and then hold up our\nhands in horror when we hear of\nthe commission of some awful\ncrime.\nLet those who wish to prevent\ncrime take time to look around\nand see the condition under which\nchildren are bred and obliged to\ngrow up. Let them lend a hand\nto those who are trying to remove\nsome of the causes and they will\ndo far1 more to prevent crime than\nbv crving "Crucifv him ! Crucify\nhim!"\nHe\'s Right.\n"Even the cleverest and most\nperfect circumstantial evidence is\nlikely to be at fault, after all, and\ntherefore ought to be received\nwith great caution," said the late\nMark Twain.\n"Take the case of any pencU\nsharpened by any woman. If you\nhave witnesses, you will find she\ndid it with a knife ; but if you sim\nply take the aspect of the pencil\nyou will say she did it with her\nteeth."\nGIVE BABY FRESH AIR\nLuckily for the peopling of the\nworld, babies are not apt "catch\ners." That is, they are not espe\ncially susceptible to smallpox,\ndiphtheria and scarlet fever.\nThey do not catch cold easily.\nPart of baby\'s luck is no doubt\ndue to the fact that he is not taken\nin crowded street cars nor allow\ned to mingle with other children\nwho mav have a disease or who\nmay just be getting over it.\nIn fact, the cold-catching habit\nis more a result of wrong living\nthan anything else. And baby\nhasn\'t had time to get that habit\nyet.\nGenerally speaking, the follow\ning rules on temperature are wise\nto observe when raising a baby:\nKeep the room in which baby\ndoes most of his living at 68 de\ngrees. Until he is three months old\nthe night temperature should not\ngo below 65. From 3 to 12 months\nold the temperature may be 55,\nand after that age 45 is proper.\nBe sure to air the room well\nat least twice in the day. After\nhe is three months old the baby\nshould have an airing out of dodrs\nevery day except in the worst of\nweather.\nThere\'s nothing quite so stimu\nlating to the smallone\'s growth\nand love of living as to sieep out .\nof doors for a time each day. But\nthis, of course, must be guided by\nweather and other individual con\nditions. o o\nThere are forty-eight kinds of\nhouse flies.', 'IF YOU HATE SICKNESS AND DEATH OPEN UP\n"WIND-EYE" AND LET THE FRESH AIR IN\nTHE\nDon\'t let cold weather, don\'t\nlet snow or rain or wind or any\nother condition whatsoever, keep\nyour windows closed all the time !\nGet fresh air and give your loved\nones fresh air !\nThe lack of proper ventilation\nof our dwellings is responsible for\nseveral of our most serious and\ndeadly diseases. Headache, the\nbane of existence; anemia, the\nghost of civilization; disordered\ndigestion, making life "blue" and\n"brown" instead of rosy; pneu\nmonia, the arch-slayer of man\nkind, and the Great White\nPlague, are, in a great measure,\ndue to badly ventilated houses.\nA man\'s house may be his cas\ntle, but it need not be his prison\nand tomb. Badly ventilated\nhouses are always overcrowded.\nFrom the physiological point of\nview, the evils of overcrowding\ncan be produced in two ways. 1.\nBy housing more people in a\ngiven space. 2. By keeping the\nwindows snugly closed.\nThe dire results of actual nu\nmerical overcrowding are shown\nby statistical study made in\nmany places. It was found that\nthe death-rate among families\nwho occupied one room was 40\nin a thousand; in those occupy\ning two rooms the death rate was\n28; of those who lived in three\nrooms, only 14 of every thousand\ndied; only seven of a thousand\ndied in families occupying four\nrooms. And self-imposed over\ncrowding through superstitious\nfear of air, night air and air in\ngeneral, will crowd us out of the\nranks of the living in substan\ntially the same way.\nThe immediate remedy open\nwindows is as simple as its ap\nplication is rare. It will save you\neven if you and yours are crowd\ned into one room. You would\nnot think of lighting a fire in\nyour house and shutting off the\nescape of the smoke through the\nchimney. It would suffocate you.\nIt-is the same with the human\nbody. It is always taking in.\noxygen and burning up food,\nwhich is converted into body tis\nsues, animal heat and energy.\nIf you keep the windows closed\nit is just like closing up the\nchimney. The carbon dioxide,\nthe smoke of the body and other\ninjurious products escape and\nfresh oxygen cannot be taken in.\nThe life-fires begin to grow dim.\nThe energies flag, digestion be\ncomes disordered, life becomes a\nweary burden, disease finds ready\nentrance.\nIf your window is only a square\nhole in your round of existence,\nit will make it a pretty short\nround for you. Window means\n"wind-eye" an airway through\nwhich the first essential of life,\noxygen, is to be taken in. Air\nand sunshine and the blessed\ncleansing and invigorating winds,\nthe breath of heaven and God, \'\nmust be our constant compan\nions. Our fear of air is so great that\nit is not even equalled by the', 'proverbial fear the little boy has\nfor soap and water. It is a verit\nable aerophobia. In the summer\na sort of truce reigns. But as\nsoon as the cold weather ap\nproaches, we shut ourselves close\nly in and the air out.\nAll the activities of life are\ncarried on in a few dingy, stuffy\nfrooms; there we go on breathing\nand exhaling, cooking, stewing\nA FUNNY INCIDENT IN "\nCurve pitching was a great in\nnovation in its day and caused\nalmost as great a commotion as\nthe advent of the aeroplane or the\nwireless telegraph.\nI think it was back in \'80 or\nthereabouts that I first saw it un\ncorked and experienced the bitter\nhumiliation of being repeated\nly whiffed out by a youngster\nseveraf years my junior and for\nwhom I had theretofore enter\ntained that feeling of contempt\nwith which the haughty captain\nof a crack team is wont to view\na fresh kid who wears glasses\nand doesn\'t approve of slang.\n. I was a battle-scarred back\nstop, approaching the mature and\nseasoned age of 17, had been the\nhero of the local diamond for sev\neral . seasons, and had, by careful\ncultivation, acquired the swag\nger and gruffness of voice which\nI conceived to be proper attrib\nutes of men like Pop Anson, Sil\nver Flint and myself. My\nbroken and distorted fingers\nwere the admiration of the entire\nvillage and a source of no small\nsatisfaction to myself, although\nI would gladly trade them for\nland brewing, giving life to new\ngenerations, and through our ig\nnorance, inviting death for all.\nOf all the numerous functions\nand Xises of a window that of an\nairway is to be kept uppermost\nin mind.

It was some time\nlater that the pneumatic protec\ntor, the padded mitt and the wire\nmuzzle came into general vogue,\nand as effective pitching depend\ned entirely upon speed and con\ntrol, it required good nerve to\nface the sizzling delivery of\n"Budge" Merchant, and I am in\nclined t6 wince and flinch as I\nwrite about it.\n"Gabby" Williams was a pale,\nand ladylike sort of a boy who\nflocked mostly with the girls and\nmade himself obnoxious by\nstudying hard and showing us\nolder ginks up at examinations.\nHe looked as much like a ball\nplayer as a jack-rabbit resem\nbles a bull terrier.\nOf course, we had heard of\ncurve pitching, but it sounded\nlike a josh to us wise ones and\nwe passed it up all but Gabby.\nIt had a scientific sound to him\nand he began to take an interest\nin baseball and to work out the', 'curve problem all by himself with\nhis father\'s barn for a backstop.\nWell, it was along lite in the\nseason and we were up against\nour traditional enemies, -a scrap\npy team from Kenosha.

At the end of\nthe fourth inning it looked to be\nall over when Clabhy Williams\ncame to me with the astounding\nsuggestion that I give him a try\nout on the mound.\nHad he offered himself for a\nfinish fight with Peter Jackson\nI couldn\'t have been more amaz\ned. There were hoots of derision\nwhen little Gabby Wilhams, pale\nand nervous, but with a gleam in\nhis eye and a turn to his jaw that\nwe had never seen there before,\nentered the box and faced a big,\ngrinning southpaw who had al\nready landed on the pill for two\nthree-baggers and a home run.\nHe didn\'t use any wind-up and he\nhadn\'t much speed, but he fanned\nevery Kenosha gink that came to\nbat for five straight innings and\npulled the game out of the fire.\nAnd ever since that time when\nI have met up with very proper\nsmall persons who are pale and\ndelicate and wear glasses and\nflock with the skirts a bit, I re\nmember little Clabby, and I say\nto myself, "Well, by thunder!\nYou never can tell!"\nWh.
