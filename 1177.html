Williams Drug Company\nTZSa KTU1T BKUQ ITORP\nKENTUCKY IS TO BE\nRUSHED THROUGH\nRoads I\'pon Which Government Pays\nPart Will Be Built Xext Year\nSays Commissioner.\nFrankfort, Ky, Dec. 11. Work on\nthe road projects ou which the United\nStates government Is paying half the\ncost will be rushed as soon as work\ncan be resumed in the spring, said J.\nS. Boggs, commissioner of Public\nRoads, In discussing the effect of ad\nverse court decisions on the program\nof the state road department More\nthan 400 convicts from the State Re\nformatory at Frankfort are to be\nworked at isolated points in the state\nnext year, he said.\nThe decision of the Appellate Court\nthat the whisky tax of 50 cents a Iwr-\nrel was unconstitutional and the de\ncision of a county court recently that\nthe law permitting counties to loan\nmoney \' to build roads was invalid,\nhave caused road work to come to a\nvirtual standstill, according to the\ncommissioner. Only work on Fedirai\naid projects is being continued.\n"Kentucky needs $10,000,000 yearly\nfor good roads," said Mr. Boggs, "Now\nwe have about $3,000,000, including\nthe sum given to the state by the Fed\neral government. And the Federal aid\nlaw runs out in 1922.\n"The government engineers l-.ave\nrefused to extend more aid to Ken\ntucky at this time. The assert that the\nwork already started will require\n$40,000,000 to complete while under\nthe present law the state can get\nabout $3,800,000 more from the Fed\neral government This la matched by\nan equal sum from the state.\n"Just what the Federal program\nwill be Is uncertain. There is a. bill\nto come before Congress again the\nnext session extending the Federal aid\nlaw. This bill has Its advocates, but\nthere is another group which favors\nthe Townsend bill calling for the\nbuilding of two roads in each state\nand maintaining them by the Govern\nment 1\'ndcr this bill each state would\nget one east and west highway and\non extending North and South entirely\nacross the state.\n"We had prospects of getting money\nto build some really good roads under\nthe county aid law before U was\nthrown aut by the courts. Counties\nall over the state had promised us\nhelp and we already had $1,037,000\npledged In this way."\nThere Is not an Improved road all of\nthe way across Kentucky anywhere,\naccording to the Commissioner. The\nJackson Highway is the nearest to be\ning Improved all of the way across,\nbut in many places It now Is very\nrough, he said.\nMonogram belt buckles, Waldemar\nbuckles made to order In gold or sil\nver.

This amount of money is so\ngreat it overwhelms the imagination;\nYet there is oue comparison which may be useful in bringing\nhome to everybody the stupendous cost to the taxpayers of their be\ntrayal by Administration incompetents.\nIn June, 1917, the first Liberty Loan was floated. The Treasury\nappealed to every patriot in the country to help out. Four million\nlive hundred thousand men, women and children subscribed. Some\nof them wei" poor, and their subscriptions meant for them privations.\nOthers su\' .. ;ribed more than they could afford because the Govern\nment had to have the money.\nThis first Liberty Loan was for exactly $2,000,000,000, or the\namount which the shipping transactions of the Administration have\ncost the taxpayers in graft, waste and peculation.\nThe men and women who worked and saved to buy the first Lib\nerty Loan will have at least an idea of what the scoundrels aud in\ncompetents have cost them in Government shipbuilding and opera\ntion. New York Herald- v\nThe letter from Secretary Colby to the representative of Mexico,\nmade public today, precipitates an immediate and decisive test of U\ngood faith of the men who now assume control of Mexican affairs.\nTheir assurances have been voluble. Now it is time for them to make\ngood by action. The United States through Secretary Colby asks\nthem to put their names to a treaty that will insure the execution of\nthe promises so- freely given.\nThe history of Mexican-American relations since the removal of\nDiaz, ten years ago, is strewn with broken promises and unfaithful\nacts on the part of the Mexicans who controlled the policy of their\ncountry. President Wilson was repeatedly victimized by scoundrels\nwho misrepresented the Mexican people, and the list of outrage\nagainst American persons and property was steadily enlarged. The\nvacillation of the United States increased the confidence of those\nMexicans who controlled the situation. It is a familiar story, one\nthat is replete with humiliating episodes which all Americans would\n"like to forget.\nNow Alvaro Obregon becomes president of Mexico after a revo\nlution in which President Carranza was murdered. Obregon \'s elec\ntion was as regular as any election could be in a country where the\nbulk of the population have not the slightest idea of what an ela\ntion means or how to mark a ballot. The country is physically at\npeace for the time being, and there seems to be a general feeliug of\ngood will toward the new executive. The Mexicans ar hopeful of of\nrelief from the long series of outrages perpetrated upon them by\ngrafters constituting their government. Obregon \'s promises of hot\nter government have a ring of sincerity to them, and his character\ngives some assurance that he will try to preserve order.\nObregon made his revolutionary campaign as a champion of the\nnew constitution, which contains an article seeminly subversive of\nland titles. The foreign investors in Mexico, including Americans,\nhave been greatly concerned over this article, since its strict execu\ntions would shake the integrity of their investments, if not sweep\nthem away. The United States Government has clearly intimatod\nthat it would not recognize the Mexican government if ArticleXXYII\nwere enforced in such a manner as to destroy titles honestly acquired\nWashington Post.\nHOPEFUL OUTLOOK IN MEXICO.\nAlthough he is a man of achievement in military activities, the\nnew president of Mexico is primarily a business man, a substantial\nman of atfpirs in private life- He is not a grafting politician or polit\nical adventurer such as may onf the men who have been prominent in\nMexican stairs since the retirement of Diaz. There is every season to\nbelieve that he will be able to enlist the support of the better element\nof Mexican citizenship, command the respect of other nations, and\nestablish orderly government in our sister Republic In that event,\nwhich is deeply to be wished, the people of the United States may r\nsume their commercial relations with the people of Mexico on a basis\nbf mutual confidence and with benefit to the interests of both nations.\nMexico is in great need of all the assistance of not only American\ncapital, but of American skill in large industrial undertakings. Many\nof Mexico\'s resources are such as to require development en a larpe\nscale in order to assure the highest success. The mines, the oil de\nposits, and even the large areas of unused agricultural and grazing\nlands, can best be developed by men who have had extensive expedi\nence in Arming organizations for production, transportation and\ntrade. America has an abundance of capital, plenty of men who have\nbeen trained in the practical management of large enterprices, and a\nspirit of friendly cooperation. The new President of Mexico seems to\nbe a man who will seek to encourage legitimate investments by for\neign capital in the development of the resources of his country. The\nnext President of the United States will be a man who will do every\nthing proper to cultivate .friendly relations without sacrificing that\nnational self respect which necessitates recognition of the rights f\nour citizens.\nThe administration of Harding in the United States and of Obre\ngon in Mexico should be remembered as marking the restoration of a\nfeeling of mutual respect and confidence betwen the two great le\npublics of North America.\nThey have to keepthe doors of the Hall otFarae carefully lok.d\nthese days to keep the movie actors from breaking in-\nApparently most of the population imagined that the Volstoid\nAct was pnHwed with reservation.\nFCC!)

We were then sure and e are now ;\nsure that every Republican desires that the expenses of\nthe campaign be distributed in this manner.\nYour presidential campaign this year cost no more than that\nof 1916, when a dollar went nearly twice as far as it\ndoes today.\nFour years ago the bulk of the campaign fund came from\n750 contributors, while this yearthe approximately\n$2,000,000 contributed to date for the presidential\nelection has come from E0.000 givers.\nThe victory won, the raising of the deficit would be easy,\nindeed, if your committee were willing to abandon the\npolicy of keeping down the average of contribution.\nThis we are determined \'not to do. It was a fight of\nall the people. The result speaks for itself. It lifted\na burden from the minds of millions and. points the\nway to better and happier days. We ask now for that\nadditional, help from all which Is merited both by the\nsuccessful conclusion of the effort and by the consequent\ncontribution to the welfare of all of our people and the\nglory of the nation.\nLet us now have help from every American who is grateful\nfor the victory and all that it means to the country. It\nmight well be in the nature of a thanksgiving offering\nfor the return to a certainly safe, sane, constitutional\nprogressive government. \'\nLet us by general and generous giving put the seal of ap\nproval upon the policy of putting a national administra\ntion in power free from any possible embarrassment of\nspecial obligation to any man, men or group of men.\nLet us make the contribution, whether large or small,\nand whether or not we have heretofore given, com\nmensurate with our means and our appreciation, always\nwithin-the maximum limit heretofore fixed.\nLet us get our names on the cornerstone of a sturdier political\nstructure, upon the roll of those who have helped make\npossible a campaign of which, in methods and result,\nwe may as Republicans and patriots be justly proud.\nMost earnestly we urge that this aid be given quickly, that\nyour committee may be enabled to discharge the party\'s\nobligations and turn to further constructive work in be\nhalf of party and country.\nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,\nWill H.

They are concerned also\nover the fact that the poy of school\nteachers has so far declined, while\nthat of other vocations has been In\ncreasing, that the earlier grade of am\nbittous youth which waa .content to\nteach school as a stepping-tone to\nither things or while receiving higher\nlearning at some higher Institution is\nno longer to be had.\nIt has been proposed In the Towner\nbill that a Department of Education\nbe created so that the head of it might\nhave a place in the Cabinet and so\nthat all its energies might be devoted\nto the one purpose of doing away with\nignorance in the United States and\nlaying the foundations of an educa\ntlonal system so broad and deep that\nsuch a condition as at present exists\ncould never return. Yet because the\npowers of the federal government In\nthis respect are confined to the Dis\ntrict of Columbia and the territories,\nIt Is believed by many of the national\nlegislators that such a department\nwould be too great a piece of machin\nery for the task.
