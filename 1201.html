        <pre>['Writing of France, this author notes that “the crux of the regime’s insta\xad\nbility at home and unsuccess abroad [«] its failure to solve the problem of North \nAfrica, and the problems which the army of North Africa now poses in French \npolitics: France would like Nato support on Algeria, but “this is not a price most \nEuropeans are willing to pay.”\nThe French View of Europe\nBy E u g en  W eber\nAssociate Professor of History, University of California at I.os Angeles\nThere are 40 million subjects in France, \nwrote a pamphleteer of the nineteenth \ncentury, not counting the subjects of dissatis\xad\nfaction. There are several million more \nFrench subjects today, but the subjects of \ndissatisfaction remain countless. They cer\xad\ntainly seem no fewer than on May 13, 1958, \nwhen rebellion in Algiers, indifference and \nindecision in Paris, ushered in one more re\xad\npublic—Fifth of that name—destined to \nsolve the problems of order, authority and \nnational unity which its predecessors had \nfound insoluble.\nThe new Republic had a prestigious be\xad\ngetter: Charles de Gaulle, who presided over \nthe making of its Constitution and became \nfirst president of a state geared to his speci\xad\nfications; a presidential regime intended to \navoid the governmental instability, parlia\xad\nmentary anarchy, and executive impotence \nthat had played an important part in the \ncollapse of the Fourth Republic. But de \nGaulle was not the only guest at a christening \nwhere many had scarcely laid aside the lethal \nweapons they had used or, mostly, threatened \nto use a little while before; and where the\nEugen Weber, a graduate of Emmanuel \nCollege, Cambridge, studied and taught \nin Paris for several years after the war. \nHe is the author of The Nationalist Re\xad\nvival in France, numerous articles on \nFrench affairs, The Western Tradition \nand Paths to the Present. He is cur\xad\nrently in Paris, preparing a study of the \nAction Frangaise.\nsacristy echoed to the heavy clomp of para\xad\nchutists’ boots. The Fifth was held over \nthe font by Michel Debre, who had been one \nof the most eloquent advocates of violence \nbefore its coming, and who had not hesitated \nto use it, or encourage others to use it, against \nhis political opponents. Michel Debre be\xad\ncame de Gaulle’s first prime minister, and \nhe is prime minister still. But the accession \nof the Fourth’s chief plotters to the Fifth’s \nseats of power could not put an end to plots. \nIt was merely an indication that violence \nand plotting, having proved successful, had \nincreased their range and the ransom of suc\xad\ncess. Recurrent explosions, verbal and other, \nreminded the public that the cat’s cradle of \nconspiracy had not dissolved, but merely \nshifted from the opposition to the govern\xad\nmental team.\nThis was natural enough: not all the \nrebels and conspirators had come to Paris or \nto power in 1958. When they saw that de \nGaulle had called to work with him the pusil\xad\nlanimous members of governments they had \nrisen to discard, when they saw their erst\xad\nwhile comrades, softened by the corrupting \ninfluence of power, trying to develop policies \ninstead of prejudices, those who had stayed \nin Algiers (in spirit or in fact) felt let down \nor double-crossed. Encouraged by highly- \nplaced friends in the services, police, admin\xad\nistration and in Parliament, they took up \nonce more the underground activities that \nhad paid off so well. And on several occa\xad\nsions, notably over the barricades of Janu\xad\nary, 1960, trials of strength opposed the \nhence-divided allies of 1958.\nIt is no longer possible to ignore what \nmany insisted on ignoring at the time: that\n24\n', 'The French View of Europe 25\nthe Algerian riots of January last were a de\xad\nfeat for the government. The latter had to \nnegotiate secretly with the rioters’ military \nprotectors, and saved its face only at the cost \nof important private concessions whose tenor \nhas since been revealed in the failure of all \ntalks with the F.L.N. That public opinion \nin the metropolis backed the General whole\xad\nheartedly is irrelevant. And this irrelevance \nreflects the fact that, for the moment, public \nopinion has little say in affairs decided above \nits head and, more than usual in so-called \ndemocracies, without its knowledge.\nThe parties and the politicians that had \nled or expressed opinion in the past are \neither divided and discredited still by the \nfeuds and failures of 1958, or continue loyal \nto a majority which alone, in their eyes, can \nensure stability and sense. The Communists \nare still distrusted by their left-wing neigh\xad\nbors. The Mollet Socialists (S.F.I.O.), who \nhave just decided to go into opposition, have \nnot been forgiven for supporting de Gaulle. \nThe Independent Socialists (P.S.U.) of \nGaston Deferre and Pierre Mend£s-France \nare few and appeal mostly to students and \nintellectuals. The Catholic Democrats \n(M.R.P.), represented in the cabinet, begin \nto straggle away from a majority that threat\xad\nens their basic aim of European union. Only \nGaullists (U.N.R.) and some of the Inde\xad\npendents—less independent than others— \nhold steadfast in spite of disagreements, per\xad\nsuaded that compromise is preferable to \nchaos and that de Gaulle alone can preserve \nthe country from the military coup d’etat it \nbarely escaped in May, 1958.\nIndeed, the long quiescence of the Left \n(which today begins to stir under the im\xad\npulse of students, intellectuals and unionists) \nand the forthcomingness of moderates, from \nMollet to Mauriac, from Reynaud to \nMendes, would make no sense without the \nominous presence of the soldiers. The army \nalone has the cohesion, the force, and the \nphilosophy of power developed during long \nyears in the wilderness, to impose a will that \nalmost every section of parliamentary opin\xad\nion dreads. Though seldom used openly \n(as Frangois Mauriac does every week in \nl’Express), the strongest argument of de \nGaulle’s supporters is that he is the only al\xad\nternative to a pretorian putsch and some kind\nof “fascist” regime. It seems that even the \nCommunists have found the argument con\xad\nvincing.\nUnity and Destiny\nThe unity de Gaulle strives for is not ex\xad\nactly, certainly not only, the sort of unity \nexpressed by popular suffrage or, least of all, \nby majority rule. The country, he seems to \nthink, cannot be united in terms of political \nparties, still less of programs and ideologies. \nIt must be united behind a sort of charis\xad\nmatic leadership, to fulfill the manifest des\xad\ntiny that can be discerned in the historical \ntradition and the enduring reality that is \nFrance. One of the incarnations of this \nreality is de Gaulle, another is the Army. \nThis being so, there can—there must—be no \nconflict between the General and the gen\xad\nerals. And it is very clear that, well aware \nof the tensions and soul-searchings that di\xad\nvide the army, the General wants to avoid \nany situation that would pit soldier against \nsoldier and split once more a body he has \nsplit before—in 1940.\nThere is no understanding de Gaulle with\xad\nout the realization that he is haunted by the \nmemory of 1940-1944, and determined to \navoid the kind of rift which he was once— \nbravely, unwillingly, but necessarily, instru\xad\nmental in creating. The General is no dic\xad\ntator, nor does he want to be. He seems to \nsee himself rather as a pedagogue, his task as \none of guidance and gradual education, lead\xad\ning the French towards a common goal they \nmust be taught to discern and accept—to\xad\ngether. Rebels must not be rejected from \nthe community, especially when their rebel\xad\nlion stems from honorable, patriotic motives, \nbut they must be given the reassurance and \nattention that will bring them to reason. \nFor this purpose, time is of the essence, be\xad\ncause time alone can show more soldiers, \nmore colonists, more Frenchmen, that an \nAlgerian settlement, even if it means Al\xad\ngeria’s loss, is in France’s best interest.\nEvents have shown such calculation to be \ncorrect in part. French opinion is speaking \nup for peace as it has never done before and, \neven in Algeria, more colonists than ever be\xad\ngin to come round to the idea. But time \nwhich, in this respect, works for de Gaulle, \nalso works against him. His opponents or\xad\nganize; his friends are discouraged by the\n', '26 Current History, January, 1961\ntortuous subtleties of a policy where two \nsteps forward are less obvious than one step \nback; both on the Left and Right supporters \nlose confidence and leave his camp. Mean\xad\nwhile, in Algeria, six years of killing and \nrapine are leaving a legacy of hatred on all \nsides that diplomacy will not find easy to \ndispel.\nThe critics of France tend to forget that \nthe Arab F.L.N. also, and more so, is bloody \nand violent and unjust; that it murders, mu\xad\ntilates, bums, destroys, and that it numbers \namong its victims far more Muslims than it \ndoes Frenchmen. No side has the monopoly \nof injustice and of blood. But what the \nFrench are blamed for (and their most \nnumerous and articulate critics can be found \nin France) is that being “on our side,” the \nside of freedom and justice, as we like to \nthink, they have chosen to use the methods \nof the other. They claim to defend the West \nbut, in the process, become like the enemy \nagainst which they defend it.\nYet tortures and prisons and murders and \ncamps are no longer a matter of choice, it \nseems, in war and, especially, in civil war. \nThat soldiers in fear of ambush and civilians \nin fear of their lives and for their life’s work \nshould torture and imprison, is an almost \nnecessary result of the kind of conflict Al\xad\ngeria has imposed. Only the end of war can \nput an end to torture. And when the issues \nand the mores of the civil war begin to spread \nto France, time is running short if de Gaulle \nwants to avoid the installation of Algerian \nmethods and conditions at home. Already \njustice limps and the press, long-muzzled at \nAlgiers, finds its freedom threatened in Paris. \nAnd though radio and television are dull \nand faithful echoes of the master’s voice, talk \nof fresh plots and counter-plots has filled the \nair for months.\nAll of this has a very definite bearing on \nFrance’s position, not only in Western Eu\xad\nrope but in the world. It was the Algerian \nissue that led de Gaulle to attack the “so- \ncalled United” Nations and ignore its possi\xad\nbilities just when the French-speaking Afri\xad\ncan states admitted to its counsels offered \ngreat opportunities for effective action. It \nis the Algerian issue that poisons relations \nwith these Otherwise-Francophile African \ncommunities. And it is, in part, the Algerian\nissue that haunts French relations with allies \ntom between the desire to placate Afro- \nAsia and the need not to lose a Nato partner.\nAs Suez and Cyprus, Congo and North \nAfrica have shown, Nato’s great problem is \nthat a community of interests in Europe does \nnot imply a community of interests elsewhere. \nThis has become increasingly clear as the \ncold war has shifted its sights; and the \nFrench (like the Belgians) have learned that \ntheir partners in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization have divergent policies in \nAfrica. At the same time, American pre- \npresidential election doldrums have come to \ndemonstrate what everybody knew already, \nbut what had never occurred at such a cru\xad\ncial time, that during such periods the \nAmericans have no particular or effective \nforeign policy at all. This persuaded de \nGaulle that, if the United States is, for the \nmoment, a necessary ally, such recurrent \nsabbaticals of political incoherence and dip\xad\nlomatic paralysis make it an unreliable \nleader. The great powers of the West should \ndevelop a policy of their own, cease being \nAmerica’s echo.\nOf course, this was only one of many as\xad\npects of an attitude whose basic purpose is, \nas it always has been, the affirmation of \nFrench greatness and independence and \npower; a purpose which, de Gaulle tells us \nin his Memoirs, had already led him in 1944 \nto decide “if necessary to contract on one side \nor another whatever alliances should prove \nnecessary, without ever accepting any kind \nof dependence.”\nA sentence like this is a whole program, \nessential to understanding French policies be\xad\ntween 1944 and 1946, as between 1958 and \n1960. It explains a policy that accepts the \nUnited Nations as long as it does not inter\xad\nfere with French interests but denounces it \nas soon as it attempts to intervene in French \naffairs that don’t concern it. It explains the \nemphasis of the Little Europe of the Six \nagainst the looser and less reliable arrange\xad\nments of American-dominated Nato. It also \nexplains the recent attempts to develop \nmeans of independent action which, the \nFrench hope, will enable them to stand alone \nif they have to, and to pursue the policy they \nchoose instead of accepting compromises im\xad\nposed by outsiders with different interests \nand points of view. Its results can be judged\n', 'The French View of Europe 27\nin a glance at France’s military situation and \nplans.\nFrance’s Military Position\nThe necessities of Algerian warfare have \nsucked away most of the troops France was \nsupposed to keep in Europe under her Nato \nobligations: instead of 14 French divisions \nin Germany there are two, badly equipped \nand poorly armed, according to recent state\xad\nments of their commanding general. The \nconcern for prestige channels billions badly \nneeded by conventional troops, or better still \nin other sectors of the national economy, to\xad\nwards production of atomic weapons des\xad\ntined, it would seem, to remain as symbolic \nas they are costly. The atomic devices \nFrance possesses today would have to be sent \nto the enemy by train. The jet-powered \nforce de frappe it hopes to possess tomorrow \nwill be equally out of date by the time it is \nready in the late 1960’s. And the army, \nbrave and battle-hardened as it is after 21 \nyears of uninterrupted war, may, after its \nlong experience of guerilla warfare, prove as \nunprepared for modem combat as Bazaine’s \ntroops did in 1870.\nAll this has come under heavy criticism \nfrom “Europeans” who fear that independ\xad\nence for France means a slow-down in the \neconomic and political integration of West\xad\nern Europe, and from “patriots” uneasy at \na growth of German power which the need \nto invest men, material and money in North \nAfrica serves to emphasize. African involve\xad\nment means, in effect, absence from Europe. \nAnd France’s European absence weighs \nheavily on her European plans. Independent \naction means ineffective action. And this \nineffectiveness is too apparent not to affect \nthe judgment of observers.\nThere is also specific criticism of the heavy \ninvestments proposed for the force de frappe. \nThe bill Parliament is asked to pay, or de\xad\ncide the French will pay, amounts to 600 \nbillion francs, $120 billion. Industry could \nuse this capital; and it could use the scarce \nscientists and the technicians that this grand \nand perhaps useless project would employ. \nFor, while France’s economic situation is \ngood, it is less brilliant than it was in 1957 \nand less dynamic than that of her partners \nand competitors in the Common Market.\nIndustrial production continues to expand \n(a seven-eight per cent increase is expected \nin 1960 over 1959); but the rate of expan\xad\nsion, lower than in 1957, last year of the de\xad\nfunct Fourth, is half that of German industry \nand just over one third that of the Italians.\nAnd meanwhile, much other capital that \ncould help remedy this state of affairs is \nbeing poured into the creation of an Algerian \nindustrial and economic structure which is \nsupposed to justify French rule and good \nintentions but which may or may not con\xad\ntinue as part of the nation’s property and \npotential. Nor is it doubtful that if the \ncountry could reduce the proportion of na\xad\ntional revenue devoted to military expenses \nfrom the present 12 per cent (Algeria \nagain!) to something like the Germans’ 7 \nper cent, more capital would become avail\xad\nable for investments either in industry or in \nsectors which, like agriculture, are crying \n(and sometimes striking) out for reform.\nAs far as the government is concerned, \nhowever, better is the enemy of good enough. \nThere is plenty of planning for economic re\xad\nform, but little doing. France modernizes \nher economy in a liberal climate: freedom \nfor small enterprises to go out of business, \nfreedom for the great to command the mar\xad\nket, freedom for the State to interfere on be\xad\nhalf of those influential enough to enlist it \nand to regulate those too weak to resist. Offi\xad\ncial attention, however, is concentrated on \ninternational affairs which, as the General \nhas always made clear, are the most fitting \noccupation of statesmen.\nIn this field, the developments of 1960 \nhave not improved the understanding be\xad\ntween France and her friends. The essence \nof the French, position was presented on May \n30,1960, when, commenting on the failure of \nthe Summit Conference, de Gaulle referred \nto “the necessity of that Western Europe, \nonce the dream of the wise and the ambition \nof the strong, today an indispensable condi\xad\ntion of world stability”—a necessity which \ncould be achieved by “the organized coop\xad\neration of States, pending the eventual de\xad\nvelopment of an imposing confederation.”\nEuropean Confederation\nOnce again, a supreme stylist had put his \nmain points in a nutshell: confederation, not\n', '28 Current History, January, 1961\nintegration; at the governmental level, not \nat any more popular or ideological one. In \nthe new Europe, as in the new Nato, the \nnation would remain the basic unit. Gov\xad\nernments should concert for common action; \nsoldiers should fight each for his country and \nnot for some supranational ideal; relations, \neconomic and other, should be arranged by \ngovernment-appointed delegates in com\xad\nmittee, not by supra-national bodies with \nvelleities of independence, like the European \nCoal and Steel Community or Euratom.\nThese, in very general terms, were de \nGaulle’s ideas in 1950 as in 1960; and these \nwere the ideas he was forced to abandon \nbefore the opposition of his Litde European \nallies, afraid of shaking Nato, unwilling to \noffend the United States or endanger al\xad\nready-established European institutions like \nE.C.S.C., suspicious of French nationalism \n(which has played its part in the recent re\xad\nvival of German nationalism), unwilling to \ndrift too far from Britain and the Outer \nSeven.\nIn October, 1960, Prime Minister Debre \ndeclared at Metz that the government ap\xad\nproves the continuation of European integra\xad\ntion, notably on the economic plane and, \nindeed, that it looks forward to this continu\xad\nation “with our aid and with our will to \nsucceed.” The words must have tasted bit\xad\nter in the mouth of a notorious opponent of \nintegration like Debre, but it would soon ap\xad\npear that even his reassurance had not suf\xad\nficed to calm the fears of France’s partners, \nor restore confidence between the once-so- \nclose partners of Little Europe and, in par\xad\nticular, between Paris and Bonn.\nThe fundamental objection to the French \nproposals, the eventual suspicion of their sin\xad\ncerity, rested less upon detailed objections \nthan upon the profoundly false situation \ncreated by France’s Algerian difficulties. \nEven half-hearted acceptance of Europe \ncalled for a price. As Debre declared on \nOctober 13, to the applause of the National \nAssembly: “In Algeria, France defends the \nWest. . . .  Yet our efforts are not supported \nby Western solidarity. The fact that [Nato]\n1 The army, in this context, means, of course, the officer \ncorps; better still its activist minority. Even this is divided \nbetween what we might call national-socialists and nationalreactionaries:\nthe former, and far more numerous, being for\nradical reforms, planning and technocracy; the latter looking \nfor inspiration and support to certain Catholic organizations, \nto Franco, and to the vestiges of American McCarthyism.\ndocs not apply to the whole world is a great \ncause of weakness.” In other words, Nato \nshould support France in Algeria. This is \nnot a price most Europeans want to pay.\nOf de Gaulle’s proposed allies, none want \nto be embroiled in colonial conflicts which \ndo not concern them. None want to ex\xad\nchange the French dream of power for the \nreality of American support. Here we re\xad\nturn again, at least in part, to the crux of the \nregime’s instability at home and unsuccess \nabroad: its failure to solve the problem of \nNorth Africa, and the problems which the \narmy of North Africa now poses in French \npolitics. The 600 thousand men poised in Al\xad\ngeria could brush away the existing order as \neasily as they could roll up the Arab world \nfrom Casablanca to Cairo (and start the next \nwar). They might well do either.1 Mean\xad\nwhile, the growing uneasiness and agitation \nexpress but do not fill the need for another \npolicy, another program, another ideal that \na majority of Frenchmen can accept. Fail\xad\ning this, only the suspect siren-song of com\xad\nmunism can rise against the forceful patriotic \nand social doctrines of ambitious generals.\nAll of this still revolves around one man, \nadmired, criticized, loved, hated and ap\xad\nparently irreplaceable. But the fact that no \none knows what France would do without \nhim, that no one seriously suggests another \nwho could take his place, reflects de Gaulle’s \nessential failure. A Constitution made to \nmeasure, a government handpicked for \nobedience and discipline, a country that is \njust beginning to lose confidence in his gen\xad\nius, a press and radio that echo government \ndirectives, timid and accommodating unions, \nCommunists who have not even begun to \nstir, political parties disorganized, silenced \nor admiring, overwhelming public support, \na reasonably healthy economy, all these have \nnot enabled the General-President to find or \nimpose a solution to the problem that \nbrought down the Fourth Republic, and to \nput France on her feet again.\nIf France was sick in 1958, she is not fun\xad\ndamentally better now. A situation which \nturns around the presence of one man is not \na healthy one, for, sooner or later, men cease \nto be. Then what? De Gaulle has done \nnothing to solve this.\nThe Fourth Republic fell because, faced\n(Continued on p. 46)\n', '46 Current History, January, 1961\nprosperity of the E.E.C. countries. In their \nopinion, self-interest, as well as other con\xad\nsiderations, dictates that Britain should seek \nadmission to Europe’s supra-national com\xad\nmunities and should then try to arrange \nsome form of association for the Common\xad\nwealth countries. The views of this group \nhave obviously influenced cabinet policy. \nOn July 25, 1960, speaking then in his role \nas Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd described \nBritain’s changed attitude toward Europe to \nan attentive House of Commons:\nW e in  B rita in  re g a rd  ourselves as p a r t  of\nE u ro p e.

The Fifth \nhoped to avoid this vice by eliminating Par\xad\nliament; but it forgot the Army by whose \ngrace it had come to be. Today, as the co\xad\nherence of the Executive declines, as orders\nand counter-orders fly through the channels \nof command, Right and Left take up once \nmore the struggle for succession. The issue \nis fundamental. The struggle might be \nbloody. But the decision rests, as open \npower may before too long, with the soldiers \nand with their guns.\n“The United Nations has become progressively more representative. But we \nmust remember that, even now, it is not fully so. Colonialism still has its strong \nfootholds in some parts, and racialism and racial domination are still prevalent, \nmore especially in Africa.\n“During these past fifteen years, the United Nations has been often criticized \nfor its structure and for some of its activities. These criticisms have often had \nsome justification behind them. But, looking at this broad picture, I think we \ncan definitely say that the United Nations has amply justified its existence and \nrepeatedly prevented our recurrent crises from developing into war. It has played \na great role and it is a little difficult now to think of this troubled world without \nthe United Nations. If it has defects, those defects lie in the world situation \nitself which inevitably it mirrors. If there had been no United Nations today, \nour first task would be to create something of that kind. I should like, therefore, \nto pay my tribute to the work of the United Nations as a whole, even though I \nmight criticize some aspect of it from time to time.\n“The structure of the United Nations when it started was weighted in favor \nof Europe and the Americas. It did not seem to us to be fair to the countries of \nAsia and Africa. But we appreciated the difficulties of the situation and did not \npress for any changes. With the growth of the United Nations and more coun\xad\ntries coming in, that structure today is still unbalanced. Even so, we wish to pro\xad\nceed slowly and with agreement and not to press for any change which would \ninvolve an immediate amendment of the Charter and the raising of heated con\xad\ntroversies. Unfortunately we live in a split world which is constantly coming up \nagainst the basic assumptions of the United Nations. We have to bear with this \nand try to move ever more forward to that conception of full cooperation between \nnations.\n“That cooperation does not and must not mean any domination of one \ncountry by another, any coercion or compulsion forcing any country to line up \nwith another country. Each country has something to give and something to \ntake from others. . . . —Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, in a speech \ndelivered to the U.N. General Assembly on October 3, 1960.\n']</pre>
