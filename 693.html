There are people without\nnumber who could run the country so\nmuch better than the president, who\ncould give Hoover the odd trump and\nthen show Mm how to fight the high\ncoat of living, and who could show\nBlack Jack how to land an army in\nPrance with one hand tied, if *hey,\nonly had the chance, says the Carson\nWeekly.\nProbably the worst of these pa-1\ntriots are those who are willing to {\nstand up and fight the Germans, pro- < (\nriding they may conduct the fighting,1 _\nand especially if they may tell the j\nenemy bow, when and where to fight. (\nThey say tbey-rrould go to any length I,\nto repel invasion, but are unalterably\nopposed to going across the ocean to\nfight. The fact that the other side of\nthe water is where the fighting is be\ning done; that there is a powerful and 1\naggressive nation, with the most won\nderful military\' organization in the\nworld baa ever known, running amuck\nand threatening to bgng all other na- \'\nlions under subjection, and with some!\nchance of doing it, seems to have been\noverlooked. These deep thinkers, wise j\nstatesmen, and military experts are\nprone to disregard the fact that Amer\nica. In consequence of the wanton\nsinking of a lot of American ships,\ncarrying American citizens, in waters\nwhere they had a perfect right to go,\nhas .declared war on the Teutonic al\nItca. The declaration having been\nmade. It is too late to discuss the whys\nand the wherefores. The fact that we\nare at war shuts out all other con\nsiderations. Whether the president!\nand congress were right or wrong has !\nnothing to do with the case. We have ?\nentered this titantic struggle, and !\nuast either conquer or be conquered.\nIf wi win, and there Is uny wrong to j\nbe set right, then will be the time to |\nmake the correction. Should we lose. I\nand without the support of our people\nwe surely will lose, then the fate of \\\nclgturn will be ours. Freedom of i\nspeech will be gone. Liberty of action 1\nwill be a thing of the past. The very\nright which those opponents of the\'\nwar most enjoy, that of criticism of\'\nthe government, will cease to be.\nAmerica, should the Prussians prevail,\nwill become a province. The war, now\nthat we are in it, must be fought to a\nconclusion, and must be fought where\nthe enemy Is. It would be much easier,\ndoubtless, and less unpleasant, if the\nenemy would come over in small par ]\nIlea and let us kill them, a few hun\ndred thousand at a time, but they\nwon\'t do it. If we wait until they are\nready to come over and fight, they will\nfinish with Europe first, and then come\nin overwhelming numbers, burn our\ncities, destroy our factories, ravish\nour women, murder our children, cn\nplave our men, and do other things\nunpleasant to contemplate. The time\nand place to fight Is now. and on their\nground.\nMOST AWFUL\n3 YEARS IN\nHISTORY PASS\nNEW YORK. Aug. 10.?The three\nmost ttwful years in the world\'s his\ntory have drawn to a close.\nThree yearH ago Wednesday, Aug ;\nust 1, Germany declared war on Ilus-,\nsin, precipitating a conflict which has!\nkilled Ave million soldiers and certalu\nly over a million civilians- perhaps\nmany more; cost directly between sev\nenty-five and a hundred billion dol\nlars, and piled up a sum In human\nwoe entirely incalculable and Incom\nprehensible.\nNot a corner of the earth has been\ntoo remote to feel the effect of the\nforty million or more men who have\ngone forth to war. Not an intelligent\nbeing but has been stirred to his\ndepths by the dreadful, wasteful Are\nthat has scourged the globe.\ni\'rom a petty Ilalknn quarrel, re\nsuiting In the seizure of Ilosnta and\nHerzegovina, by Austria and In the\nassassination of the heir to the throne\nof the dual monarchy and his con\nsort by resentful Jugo Slavs, the con\nAagratlon has spread to every conti\nnent and every land. Most of the\nworld Is directly Involved In wnr. and I\nIn the non belligerent countries ques\ntions stirred up by the conflict are the\nsubject of Intence and constant do\nniestlc differences.\nVAST MUMAN CHANGES\nWhat changes "on the way" the\nwar will make still await the grent\npeace conference to be told; but nl\nready human society has been altered i\nwith such swiftness as can scarcely!\nbe paralleled even in the era of the i j\nFrench Revolution. j;\nRussia ha? changed from the great\nest example of an absolute and bur- (\ndcnsome autocracy to the world\'s t\nfreest and most liberal democracy. ,\nwith its eyes set on ideals as high as <\nthe stars. 3\nThe people rule in Russia after cen- I\nturies of oppression, and in many t\nother nations the bonds forged by <\nbirth and privilege are giving way. i\nGermany has its first imperial <\nchancellor without a "von" to his|*\nname?a small, uncertain step toward\ndemocracy, yet a ray of hope. The j?\nJunkers and the militarists are still 11\nin the saddle, but their faithful, care- \'\nrully nourished slaves for the first \'\nime have them worried.\nIn every country the importance of:\n;overnment has increased. The cen-1\ntral authority has had to take over]\npowers it never possessed or wished\nbefore. The peoples are thinking\nmote about their governments, selfish\nthoughts perhaps, for their leaders\nmean more to them than formerly.\nGOVERNMENTS MORE ACTIVE\nThe British government has taken\nover thousands of great industrial\nplants to run on war work, while\nsimilar changes of revolutionary\ncharacter have taken place in France.\nItaly and Germany, Even the United,\nStates has commandeered all the ship\nyards for the purpose of speeding\nthem up. and will undoubtedly take |\nover more and more lines of pro-!\nduction as the conflict wears on.\nThrough the vast pressure of war\nbusiness, woman\'s place in the com\nmunity everywhere has increased inj\nimportance. The wives and sweet\nhearts must labor while their men j\nare on the field of battle. And this\nprominence of the fair sex has re\nsulted in the promise of equal suf\nfrage to women In Great Britain and\nwill undoubtedly give greater politi\ncal rights to women in many other\'\nlands.\nThe dignity of work lias received\n????cognition such as was never accord- j\ned before Germany has forced by la>v j\nperhaps a million persons into in\ndustry; France would have put a\nsimilar measure into effect had the\n(Continued on page three.)\nAPPLICATION NO. 4469\nNotice of Application for Permission |\nto Appropriate the Public Waters\nof the State of Nevada\nNotice is hereby given that on the I\n15th day of June. 1917, in accordance\nwith Section 59, Chapter 110, of the\nStautes of 1913, one Harry Parker, of\nGold Creek, Count; of Elko, and State i\nof Nevada, made application to the\nState Engineer of Nevada for per\nmission to appropriate the public wa\nt. rs of the State of Nevada.

RI SIOCNCF130* i:\nIS *\'\nMOST AWFUL 3 YEARS\nIN HISTORY PASS\n(Continued from page 2.)\nentrance of the United States into the\nwar not uiade this unnecessary. The\nState of West Virginia has passed a\nstatute making it a crime to be idle\nIn war time, and the sentiment which\nwas behind this law is felt through\nout the world.\nHUMAN LIFE\'S WORTH\nFor their working millions the gov\nernments are caring as never be\nfore. Their health and their lives\nare the object of solicitude. The\nvalue of a human being, simply from\nthe standpoint of productivity, is\nrealized. The well learned lesson,\nthat it pays to conserve human life\nand energy, will be remembered and\nwill undoubtedly, some day, when this\nwar is over, rpsult in making the\nworld a better place to live in.\nMen\'s brains have been busy these\nthree years of war. But, if we take\nThomas A. Edison\'s word for it, the\nresults of new inventions have been\nsurprisingly small. And still smaller\nhave these results been from the point\nof view of human benefit. Most of the\nnew devices are means to slay and\nmaim.\nIn two directions, however, the\nworld has progressed In ways to be\nutilized in peace time. The conquest\nof the air has gone forward rapidly;\naeroplanes fly vast distances at enor\nmous speeds in comparative safety.\nSecond. In the enormous, melancholy\nwar hospitals, the surgeons have de\nveloped new marvels in saving the\nbadly wounded, moulding new faces on\ndisfigured unfortunates, preventing\nthe suppuration of injured tissues, cur\ning severe burns and doing many\nother marvels.\nWIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION\nThe world\'s possessions have been\ndestroyed at a most alarming rate.\nScores of great cities, hundreds of\ntowns and thousands of villages lay\nin crumbling brick and mortar. Mil\nlions of homes have been devastated.\nNew enterprises, new railroads,\nbridges, schools, colleges, and a my\nraid oilier works of peace have failed\nto be built as they would have been\nin the normal development of nations.\nInstead, the old equipment has been\nwearing out. Railroads in the warring\nnations have steadily deteriorated for\nlack of men to repair and replace\nthem. Everything that does not serve\nthe immediate purposes of war has\nbeen neglected.\nSomewhere between seven and ten\nmillion tons of ocean shipping lies at\nthe bottom of the ocean, the prey of\ntlie* submarine, the mine and the ruid\ning cruiser, it will take many years\nof peace for mankind to catch up in\nmaterial things.\nEDUCATION HALTS\nIn the things of the mind the world\nhas halted, too. The usual quota of\ndoctors, lawyers and trained technl\nclans is not being turned out. Even\nelementary education is undoubtedly\nsuffering.\nAgainst this is to be set the inspira\ntion to the human brain of extensive\ntravel. The war has stirred up many\nsluggish brains. Probably fifteen mil\nlion Russian peasant, who otherwise\nwould nover have strayed fifty miles\nfrom their native villages, have gone\ntliousunds of miles nway from home\nto fight and seen strange lands and\npeoples and imbibed now ideas. They\nhave been learning many things.\nThe war has now gone the three\nyears allotted by the late Ia>rd Kitch\nener. Ills famous prediction was con\nsldered pessimistic at the time it was\nmade. Few believed the war could\nlast so long. Many were ready to\nprove by pencil and paper that ex\nhaustion would entl the struggle with\nin twelve months of Its start. Still\nIt rages, each dny more fearful, and\nthe end Is not yet.\nm ^\nJOT IT DOWN\nThat we do the very\nbest line of Commercial\nPrinting and at reasonable\nprices.
