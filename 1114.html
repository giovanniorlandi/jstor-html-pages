To support in learning \ncaring science, the learning situation has to embrace the students’ lived experience in relation to \nthe substance of caring science. One of the challenges in education involves making theoretical \nmeanings vivid in the absence of actual patients. Written patient narratives and fiction like novels \nin combination with scientific literature are often used in order to obtain lived experiences as the \nfoundation for teaching. Questions concerning how film can be used in this context to support the \nlearning of caring science have recently emerged. The aim of this study is to describe how film as \nlearning-support may boost reflection when learning caring science. The data was collected \nthrough audio-taped seminars, written reflections and group-interviews with students on basic, \nadvanced, and doctoral levels. The analysis is based on the Reflective Lifeworld Research (RLR) \napproach which is founded in phenomenology. The results show how film as a learning-support \nenhances the understanding of the caring science theory, and provides a deeper understanding of \nthe subject. Film can be very touching and provides support for the students’ embodied \nreflections. Hence, it is important that the students are encouraged to watch films from a caring \nscience perspective. This requires a structure for learning-support related to the film, such as \nhaving a focus and purpose for watching the film, as well as support for follow-ups. The film itself \ndoes not create such support and guidance; instead, it must be combined with well-considered \npedagogic thoughts on what learning is and how learning can be supported. The results are \nhighlighted with the help of Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy of ‘the lived body’, and ‘the \nflesh of the world’. \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThis study focuses on how the use of film can support \nstudents’ reflection when learning caring science. In \naddition, the study investigates ways in which \nphenomenology can serve as a means to both deepen \nand expand the understanding in lifeworld-led \nlearning.  \n \nThe view of learning reflected in this study is based \non a lifeworld theoretical foundation, with an \nepistemological starting point in Husserl’s work on \nlifeworld theory (1936) and the theory of \nintentionality (1929). Merleau-Ponty’s (1945) further \ndevelopment of Husserl’s lifeworld theory and theory \nof intentionality clarifies man’s existence in the world \nas a lived body, and outlines the philosophy that has \nbeen described as ‘the flesh of the world’ (1964), both \nwith epistemological and ontological significance. A \nlived body is understood as an integrated whole, \nwhere there are no dividing lines between body and \nsoul or life and learning (Merleau-Ponty, 1945).

He asks \nquestions regarding what the film signifies. For \nMerleau-Ponty (1948), films tell stories and are “the \nclosest possible reproduction of a drama which \nliterature could evoke only in words and which the \nmovie is lucky enough to be able to photograph” (p. \n57). \n \nIn ‘the flesh of the world’ every thing is present both \nas visible and invisible. Both existences and matter \nare affected by the same world in reversibility; they \nare from the same ‘flesh’ (Merleau-Ponty, 1964). In \nthe ‘natural attitude’ (Husserl, 1929) things are taken \nfor granted but in learning there is a need for a \nreflective attitude. Learning must therefore be \nunderstood in relation to the individual’s unique \nexperience, and the way in which the phenomenon in \nfocus is present with its visibility. Learning must also \nbe understood in relation to aspects that are not \napparent ‘at first sight’ and the ways in which these \naspects relate to one another.  \n \nBoosted and vibrant reflection could help the students \nacquire a more problematizing attitude and thus \nbecome more aware of themselves and their actions \ngenerally, but specifically in relation to nursing. This \nreflection also needs to be supported by the teacher’s \nopenness and flexibility in relation to the person who \nis learning, in other words a learning relation that will \nhelp facilitate learning.  \n \nEkebergh (2009a) argues that within the learning \nsituation students need confirmation to help them \napproach the body of knowledge. Ekebergh (2001) \nshows that students experience loneliness when \nlearning theory and that there is a gap between the \ntheoretical abstract ideal and the concrete caring \nreality. This leads to a lack of confidence among the \nstudents, and occasionally causes repudiation of the \ntheoretical knowledge of caring. \n \nSymbolically, theoretical caring knowledge \ncan, from a student perspective, be described \nas a big ‘lump of knowledge’ which is pushed \naside in learning, since the students do not \nknow how to handle or use the ‘lump’ \n(Ekebergh, 2001, p. 154). \n \nEkebergh (2009b) emphasizes the encounter between \nthe student’s own lifeworld and scientific knowledge \nand clarifies that learning situations need to support \nand create conditions for a reflective lived process. \nThis strengthens the integration of the students’ \nlifeworld and their theoretical knowledge. Hence, in \nlifeworld-led learning the focus is on reflection and \nthe learning encounter in relation to practice \n(Ekebergh, 2005, 2007). \n \nIn caring science, the meaning of health and wellbeing\nis paramount. A caring science with a \nfoundation in ‘the lived experience’ may be viewed as \na ‘patient science’, that is, the patients’ perspective is \nthe starting point for nursing. This may include the \nlived experience of being cared for or living with a \ncertain disease, as well as the illness experience and \nhow health is lived. In order to nurse and to offer a \ntruly ‘caring care’ that is able to meet the patient’s \nneeds, the carer must try to understand the patient’s \nlifeworld (Dahlberg & Segesten, 2010). Dahlberg, \nTodres and Galvin (2009) argue that lifeworld-led \ncare is a prerequisite for a caring health-care that \nfocuses on existential conditions, health and wellbeing.\nTodres and Galvin (2010) show that well-being \nis both a way of being in the world, as well as a felt \nsense. They describe the deepest existential wellbeing\nas ‘dwelling-mobility’. \n \nStudies show that there is a gap between theory and \npractice in nursing education and that this results in \nstudents occasionally experiencing difficulties in \nassimilating theoretical knowledge and understanding \nthe usefulness of the knowledge in practice \n(Ekebergh, 2007; Ekebergh, Lepp & Dahlberg, 2004; \nLanders, 2000). The theoretical courses have a \ntendency to become too theoretical, while the \ntheoretical element is sometimes absent from the \npractical courses.  \n \nReflection is a lived process and should not be \nunderstood as a purely cognitive process; instead it \nincludes the whole person in a context (Dahlberg & \nSegesten, 2010; Ekebergh, 2001). Further, Galvin \n(2010) argues that caring care is an integration of \nhead, hand and heart that are interlaced and lived in \nrelation to earlier knowledge, experiences, ethics and \nactions. This idea is supported by Ekebergh (2009a). \nThe argument could be related to learning situations \nthat are designed to support the learning process and \nthe understanding of reflection as a lived and \nembodied process. Within this perspective the use of \nseminars and examination tasks such as written \naccounts by patients and fictional books is preferred \nin teaching situations in order to illustrate ‘the lived \nexperience’. These approaches are used in \ncombination with scientific literature and research. \nLanders (2000) argues that teachers must identify \nmethods by which they can integrate theory and \npractice to promote a learning culture. In lifeworldled\nlearning there is a need for a variety of didactic \ntools to both deepen and expand the understanding to \nthe point where the lived body is taken seriously. \n', 'Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology Volume 12    Special Edition July 2012 Page 3 of 12 \n \n \nThe IPJP is a joint project of the Humanities Faculty of the University of Johannesburg (South Africa) and Edith Cowan University’s Faculty \nof Regional Professional Studies (Australia), published in association with NISC (Pty) Ltd.

The use of film is \none possible vehicle that can be used to promote \nreflection and learning in relation to the subject. This \nraises questions regarding the significance of film as a \nsupport for students’ learning. How may film enhance \nand support the students’ learning and the possibilities \nof integrating the theoretical knowledge with \npractice? In what ways may film contribute to a \ndeepened understanding of caring science? \n \nReview of the literature \n \nA review of research in the area renders a small \nnumber of scientific articles relating to the use of film \nin nursing education (Carpenter, Stevenson & Carson, \n2008; Fleming, Piedmont & Hiam, 1990; Wall & \nRossen, 2004; Masters, 2005; Plowfield, Raymond, & \nHayes, 2006; Raingruber, 2003). There are also \nexamples in the literature that show how films are \nused in teaching (Farina, 2009; Higgins & Lantz, \n1997; McGarry & Simpson, 2007; Northington, \nWilkerson, Fisher & Schenk, 2005). McConville and \nLane (2006) used on-line video clips to direct nursing \nstudents towards dealing with difficult situations, and \nthe results indicated that the students’ self-efficacy \nincreased significantly. Jensen and Curtis (2008) \nexplored the learning experiences of students in a \npsychosocial nursing class that was infused with art, \nmusic, literature and film in an attempt to enhance the \nstudents’ learning about mental illness. The results \nshow that the students enjoyed and engaged with the \ndifferent ways of presenting the material. The \nstudents also experienced a deeper level of \nunderstanding. Film has the potential to develop \nempathy and self-understanding as well as providing \nincreased cultural awareness. A phenomenological \ninvestigation by Raingruber (2003) explored the \nadvantages and disadvantages of using film in \nteaching from the students’ perspective. Films are \nuseful in promoting reflection and enhancing \nempathy. Moreover, films can portray emotional \nissues, they are engaging, and can also facilitate the \nintroduction of ethical dilemmas. However, \ndisadvantages of using films as part of learning \ninclude the fact that films are time-consuming to \nwatch, as well as the fact that they are often more \ndramatic than real-life situations. The reviewed \nstudies show that films are used to illuminate and \nspark critical reflections on different groups’ living \nconditions, like the elderly and people suffering from \npsychiatric disorders (McGarry & Simpson, 2007; \nPlowfield et al., 2006). Films can also be used to \nelucidate symptoms of illnesses and several articles \nhighlight the use of motion pictures within the area of \nmental illness in order to promote the understanding \nof symptoms of psychiatric conditions as well as \nviews on mental illness, stigmatization, values and \nethical dilemmas (Fleming et al, 1990; Jensen & \nCurtis, 2008; Wall & Rossen, 2004; Raingruber, \n2003).  \n \nThe literature shows that film and motion-pictures can \ncontribute to the traditional aspects of education, and \nalso give students an opportunity to better understand \n‘lived experience’. However, the literature review \nrevealed that there are currently no studies that \nfocused specifically on the meanings of film as \nlearning-support in order to promote reflection and to \nassist in the learning of caring science. In this study \nwe aim to describe how using films as learningsupport\nmay boost reflection and assist in learning \ncaring science. Our research questions were: How \ndoes film as learning-support enable reflection to \nfacilitate the learning of caring science? How may \nfilm as learning-support contribute to a deepened \nunderstanding of caring science? \n \nMethod and implementation \n \nParticipants and data collection \n \nTo obtain variation in relation to the phenomenon, \ndata was collected from basic, advanced, and doctoral \nstudents in different ways. Initially, a seminar with \nfour PhD students was audio-taped. Then, a seminar \nwas held with eleven master- and PhD-students in a \ncourse on lifeworld based learning. During this \nseminar, written accounts were collected. In an \nadditional course at doctoral level, oral and written \nreflections were collected from ten PhD students. At \nthe basic level, written reflections were collected \nfrom 65 nursing students, where film was used in the \nfirst lectures in caring science. Finally, a mixed-group \ninterview was carried out with three nursing students \nwho were in the second year of their nursing \neducation. The data collection occurred during 20082009.\nThe study made use of four films: The French \nfilm Blue by Krzysztof Kieslowski (1993); the Danish \nfilm Open Hearts by Susanne Bier (2002); the \nSpanish film Sea Inside by Alejandro Amenábar \n(2004); and the Swedish film The New Man by Klaus \nHärö (2007). \n \nThe films were chosen based on the aims of the \ncourses taken by the students. In addition, the films \nall illustrate existential human conditions, health and \nsuffering and can all be understood in relation to \ncaring. The seminars aimed to enhance the students’ \nlearning, and were not a part of an assessment. \nHowever, they were an aspect of the caring science \ncurriculum and supported its learning aims. \n \nThe film Blue was chosen for the PhD programme in \ncaring science, in order to enhance the students’ \nability to problematize the meaning of the patientperspective.\nIts inherent complexity from a lifeworld \n', 'Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology Volume 12    Special Edition July 2012 Page 4 of 12 \n \n \nThe IPJP is a joint project of the Humanities Faculty of the University of Johannesburg (South Africa) and Edith Cowan University’s Faculty \nof Regional Professional Studies (Australia), published in association with NISC (Pty) Ltd.

The \nfilm shows how a woman experiences loss. Her \nhusband and daughter are killed in a car accident and \nshe has to live with her grief, and attempt to \nunderstand and continue living.  \n \nThe film Open hearts was selected for the students in \nthe basic nursing programme as it was felt that it \noffered possibilities for helping them to understand \nthe meaning of concepts from caring science. The \nstudents were confronted by the film, its meanings \nand the variations of suffering that is portrays, which \ninclude guilt, shame, uncertainty, and a sense of \npowerlessness. The film portrays a young couple and \nshows how their life is destroyed by a car accident in \nwhich the young man is injured and paralyzed. The \nstory is about their struggle with life. \n  \nThe film The Sea Inside is the story of a man who is \ntired of his life; he is unable to move because of \nparalysis and he begs for euthanasia. The decision to \nshow this film to Masters and PhD students was based \non the same logic as the decision to show them the \nfilm Blue.  \n \nThe film The New Man was chosen for first-year \nstudents in the nursing programme who took a course \nfocusing on the history of ideas in caring. The film \npresents society’s view of humans in institutions and \nhighlights their duty to conform to societal \nexpectations and institutional rules in Sweden after \nthe second world-war. Disobedient persons are \npunished, for example with sterilization. \n \nThe different film seminars had different foci and \npurposes and were carried out in various ways. Each \nseminar had its starting point in the students’ \nlifeworlds and looked at how the film had moved \nthem. In all of the seminars, the students were given \nopportunities to discuss and reflect on the films, both \nindividually and in groups. The teacher who led the \nseminars tried to help the students link the films to \ntheories by asking question such as: How do you \nunderstand the situation? What caught your attention \nand why? How could this situation be understood in \nrelation to health and suffering?  \n \nAll together the data consisted of one 70 minute \naudio-taped session transcribed to text (11 pages of \ntext, single line spacing) from the first seminar, \nwritten accounts (6 pages of text) by eleven Masters \nand PhD students, as well as by ten PhD students. We \nalso obtained written accounts from 65 nursing \nstudents (10 pages of text) as well as a transcribed \ngroup interview with three nursing students (16 pages \nof text). Thus, the total data set consisted on 43 pages \nof text.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe data was analyzed from a Reflective Lifeworld \nResearch approach (RLR) founded on \nphenomenological tradition (Dahlberg, 2006a; 2006b; \nDahlberg, Dahlberg & Nyström, 2008). Data analysis \nconsisted of the identification of meanings in relation \nto the phenomenon under investigation (films as \nlearning-support to promote reflection and learning of \ncaring science). The following specific questions \nwere asked in the analysis: How may film as a \nlearning-support contribute to a deepened understanding\nof caring science? How does film facilitate \nreflection and learning? \n \nEverything in the text that related to the phenomenon \nwas highlighted. The text was divided into smaller \nparts, labeled meaning units, and their meaning was \ndescribed through the use of one or several words. \nThese meanings were then combined to form clusters \nof meanings. The meanings that emerged from the \nanalysis were then assembled based on similarities \nand differences. Thus, patterns of meanings were \nsought based on the relationships between various \nmeanings. The essential meaning structure of the \nphenomenon was then sought in these patterns of \nmeanings. \n \nOpenness and flexibility towards the phenomenon \nunder investigation is a crucial part of any research \nstudy. This requires that a critical and reflective \nattitude be adopted in order to avoid understanding \ntoo quickly or being too ‘uncontrolled’ in the \nreflections. Thus, the process of understanding needs \nto be made to ‘slow down’ in order to allow the \nphenomenon to present itself so that it can be \nunderstood and described. This reflective attitude has \nbeen described by Dahlberg and colleagues as a \nbridling of the understanding process (Dahlberg & \nDahlberg, 2003, Dahlberg, Dahlberg et al., 2008).  \n \nEthical considerations  \n \nThe investigation presented in this article conforms to \nthe principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki \n(World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, \n2008). Informed consent was obtained from all \nindividuals. The participants were guaranteed \nconfidentiality and anonymous presentation of the \nresults. We have also been careful in the translation \nfrom Swedish to English so as not to alter the original \nmeaning.  \n \nResults \n \nThe results are initially presented in accordance with \na structure of essential meanings. The phenomenon’s \nconstituents are then presented. \n \n', 'Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology Volume 12    Special Edition July 2012 Page 5 of 12 \n \n \nThe IPJP is a joint project of the Humanities Faculty of the University of Johannesburg (South Africa) and Edith Cowan University’s Faculty \nof Regional Professional Studies (Australia), published in association with NISC (Pty) Ltd.  It can be found at www.ipjp.org \nThis work is licensed to the publisher under the Creative Commons Attributions License 3.0 \nThe phenomenon’s essential meaning structure  \n \nFilm as a means of expression creates an opportunity \nto understand caring science by actualizing the \ntheoretical knowledge in such a way that it relates to a \nmeaningful and more vivid context, which enables a \ndeepened and expanded understanding. Actualizing \ncaring science takes place when one becomes touched \nand moved in several senses. This enables learning, \nsupported by reflection, to be vitalized, incorporated \nand related to one’s own nursing. Touch is powerful \nand with the support of reflection, the prerequisites to \nlearning caring science may be formed by creating a \nmovement between theory and practice. Through \nusing a ‘caring science perspective’, the knowledge of \ncaring science may be given a meaningful ‘space’. \n \nThe constituents that resulted from the analysis are \npresented in the text below and are illustrated with \nquotations from the data. The constituents are: (1) \nVitalizes and gives coherency; (2) The meaning and \npower of being touched; (3) The significance of \nreflection; and (4) Enables a deepened knowledge of \ncaring science. \n \n1. Vitalizes and gives coherency \n \nThe results show that film vivifies and gives \ncoherency and hence creates prerequisites for learning \nin caring science. Caring scientific concepts are \nclarified and this makes them easier for students to \nembrace as the film vitalizes the theory. An informant \ndescribed it in the following manner: \n \nThe film helped to put what we have been \ndiscussing into context. Things that were \npreviously abstract were concretized… //… \none gets to ‘experience’ it. One gets to hear it \nand in that way it is easier to grasp. \n \nFilm as a basis for learning seems to add an element \nthat goes beyond theoretical studies. Through \nvitalizing caring science it can be related to the \nstudent’s own nursing: \n \nFilm is an excellent means of making caring \nscience more vivid … to get other words than \nfrom the books, you can see it with your own \neyes … and I think it can be a good transition \nto when you meet the patients … that you \nbecome aware of the lifeworld, the suffering \nand how I am really supposed to handle the \ncaring relationship … \n \n2. The meaning and power of being touched \n \nFilm can affect people in a powerful way. One \ninformant expressed this by saying “it [film] moves \nthe whole of me”. It also became clear that film \nstimulates several senses and that it touches one as a \nhuman being. In this way, it is impossible to shield \nthe self from what is taking place in the film. \n \nWhen it is a story that is being told … I think \nyou get more intrigued by a story, and then it \nis easier to see the lifeworld …//… it almost \nfeels like you are in the movie yourself … or \nthat you can recognize, you can see …//… it \nwas easier to grasp that you saw it more with \nyour eyes and heard what they were saying …  \n \nThe findings show that being touched plays a \nsignificant role in triggering reflections. When one is \nmoved, reflections are evoked. One informant \ndescribes how “the power of film to move someone \ndeeply, triggers reflections.” The film awakens and \nstimulates emotions in a context and creates \nexperiences that could later be reflected upon and \ndiscussed. In this way one’s self-awareness is \nenhanced. At the same time, the students expressed \nconcerns regarding the films’ potential to touch them \ntoo deeply. For some of the students it may be hard to \nhandle the emotions, as they are reminded of their \nown life and vulnerability. The film could be \nexperienced as being penetrating and painful. One \ninformant described this in the following way: \n \nBut I also think that there is a risk of it \n‘hurting’ so much since you get too affected \nthat I don’t want to learn. Being moved takes \nover and makes me escape rather than being \nconfronted with what is ‘bad’. This may \ninhibit learning, but I still think that it is of \nimportance to get the opportunity during the \ntraining to test yourself – to put yourself on the \nline, under ordered and non-threatening \nconditions with a teacher who may give \nsupport. \n \n3. The significance of reflection \n \nReflection creates possibilities for the student to gain \ninsight into the human lifeworld and the complexity \nthat comes with being human and caring for others. \nThe use of film allows for reflections to occur and \nstudents are given the opportunity to reflect upon and \nrelate to their own nursing. One informant described \nit thus: \n \nI got aha-experiences all the time – ‘oh that’s \nright!’, ‘right, it can actually be this way, you \ncan actually feel like this’. You felt emotions \nof that it can really be like this … \n \nFilm can evoke many feelings and thoughts that may \npromote reflection. The film is lived through and \nprovides opportunities for an expanded learning that \ntranscends the film-seminars as the students may have \n', 'Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology Volume 12    Special Edition July 2012 Page 6 of 12 \n \n \nThe IPJP is a joint project of the Humanities Faculty of the University of Johannesburg (South Africa) and Edith Cowan University’s Faculty \nof Regional Professional Studies (Australia), published in association with NISC (Pty) Ltd.

According to one informant, “[t]he most \nimportant phase of learning is the follow-up so that \nthe reflecting dialogue and discussion can be made \npowerful”. The results show that structure and \ndirection should be used in the learning-situation to \ndirect the students towards reflection.  \n \nEspecially afterwards when questions about \nthe concepts were raised and discussed it was \nmade even clearer … maybe I didn’t exactly \nthink about them while watching the movie, \nbut when it had finished and you were \nsupposed to think it over … you could find all \nthe concepts in the movie … really … \n \nThe film can stimulate understanding of the \ncomplexity of human existence; there are no easy \nanswers to the questions that are raised by the films. \nThe students are provided with an opportunity to \nbecome aware of different life-situations and they can \ntry to understand how these situations can be lived \nthrough and what suffering can mean in situations \nnever experienced before. In this way films can help \nstudents understand the importance of being open and \nreflective in the caring relationship. \n \nIf you understand this from a caring \nperspective the enormous complexity emerges \nin relation to how it is possible to understand \nher … in this situation … it is easy that we \nunderstand her as showing aggression … she is \ntrying to defend herself … she is trying to \nescape from others and most from herself … \nbut we really do not know what she is \nexperiencing and what is communicated … \nhere our understanding falls short and we \ncould decide how this is to be understood \nwithout reflecting very much but I think it is \nvery important to reflect on different \npossibilities … \n \n \n \n \n4. Enables a deepened knowledge of caring \nscience \n \nProviding students with the opportunity to reflect on \nsomething different and more alive than academic \ncaring-science texts allows for the possibility of \nreaching caring scientific substance in-depth. The use \nof film can therefore contribute to the understanding \nof caring science as it allows students to acquire new \nnuances in addition to gaining more substantial \nknowledge. Thus, it forms part of a process where \nknowledge is both deepened and expanded. \n \nI have now seen how it can be enacted and we \nhave reflected upon it and tied it together, \nsomething that was harder to do before … // \nyou simply understand and can put your finger \non what is what. \n \nFilm may thus provide an understanding of what \ncaring science is about. One informant described it as: \n \nTo ‘see’ caring scientific concepts in action \nenables me to reflect upon them… \n \nIf the film affects the student it may also be \nincorporated and hence allow the knowledge to be \nembodied. One student expressed how the film had \nstayed with her: \n \nThe film is still there, you can still notice it \nafter a month … and still, it’s so, when you \ntalk about it, it comes back … it’s still there, I \nremember it … \n \nAnother informant wrote about how the knowledge \ncan be incorporated and gives a deeper understanding: \n \nAnd then it is that you get an image with your \nown feelings … with your own lifeworld so \nthat you have everything gathered together, \nreally…// It enables you to embrace the \nmessages through different senses like sight \nand hearing. It is also easier to put caring \nscience into a context and in that way get a \nbigger picture. \n \nThe theory thus can be made visible in the lived \ncomplex reality as a deepened understanding of the \nsubstance of caring science, and in this way \nknowledge of the subject can be obtained. This \nrequires that the students receive help with respect to \nthe caring science perspective. One informant stated \nthat she had seen the film previously, but not been \naffected by it in the same way before: “today I had a \n‘caring science view’ and reflected upon my own \ncaring.” \n \n \n', 'Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology Volume 12    Special Edition July 2012 Page 7 of 12 \n \n \nThe IPJP is a joint project of the Humanities Faculty of the University of Johannesburg (South Africa) and Edith Cowan University’s Faculty \nof Regional Professional Studies (Australia), published in association with NISC (Pty) Ltd.

The findings show that film can \nilluminate the needs of openness and immediacy in a \ncaring relationship in order to meet the patient’s \nneeds. This enhances the integration of theory and \npractice. In the discussion below, Merleau-Ponty’s \nwork is used to highlight the findings of this study.  \n \nThe findings of this study stress the need for a \nlearning-relation that gives the students (who are seen \nas complex beings and lived bodies) an opportunity to \nbe understood in their learning. The students need to \nbe provided with an opportunity to be able to \ntransform rigid theoretical knowledge into lived \nexperience that can transcend the learning situation.  \n \nMerleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception helps \nus understand the importance of approaching the \nstudents from a lifeworld perspective as lived bodies. \nAccording to Merleau-Ponty (1945):  \n \nThe body is the vehicle of being in the world, \nand having a body is, for a living creature, to \nbe intervolved in a definite environment, to \nidentify oneself with certain projects and be \ncontinually committed to them. (p. 94) \n \nFurther, the results also show that the students \nincorporate the meaning of the film into their bodies \nas embodied knowledge. This illustrates how \nknowledge can be understood as the topography in a \nlandscape, where some aspects become more visible \nin relation to aspects. Learning generally takes place \nin the world together with others where things are \nmore or less familiar (Merleau-Ponty, 1945). As seen \nin this study, watching film can be understood as an \nadventure in relation to earlier experiences and \nknowledge. On this ‘voyage’, the students are moving \nback and forth as part of a constant movement in their \nunderstanding. The challenge is to provoke their \nunderstanding while at the same time supporting them \nin reflecting upon the human condition. The challenge \nis to really try to expand their thinking in new ways, \ninto a “new organization of the whole” (MerleauPonty,\n1948, p. 49), like the one Merleau-Ponty \n(1948) is describing in the example with the rabbit, \nthe hunter and the forest. With the support of the \ngroup and the teacher, the students are helped to \navoid becoming lost in this adventure.  \n \nOur findings show that films can illuminate people’s \nsuffering and vulnerability and that this affects the \nstudents. Through this process, the students come to \nface their own vulnerability, which can be understood \nas a necessity in professional care. This can be related \nto Healey-Ogden and Austin’s (2010) research, which \nstates that the nursing role has to involve supporting \npeople in learning how to come to know themselves \nand subsequently embrace their own vulnerability. \nNurses’ professional responsibilities also include \npaying particular attention to supporting people on \ntheir well-being journeys. \n \nThe later philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, described as \n‘the flesh of the world’, can assist in understanding \nhow the students are interlaced with the film and the \nteachers’ and the other students’ perspectives. In this \ncontext, personal experience stands out in relation to \nothers and some meanings share more generality than \nothers. In this situation, the students have an \nopportunity to both see themselves and others, as well \nas the opportunity to be seen. Students are thus seen \n(and see) in relation to both generality and \nparticularity, in relation to space and time. This could \nbe understood in relation to Merleau-Ponty’s (1964) \nconcept of the ‘flesh of the world’ and the chiasm, \nwhich are illustrated in the following quotation:  \n \nYet this flesh that one sees and touches is not \nall there is to flesh, nor this massive corporeity \nall there is to the body. The reversibility that \ndefines the flesh exists in other fields; it is \neven incomparably more agile there and \ncapable of weaving relations between bodies \nthat this time will not only enlarge, but will \npass definitively beyond the circle of the \nvisible. (p. 144).  \n \nAccording to this quotation, seeing a film evokes a \nlived body (Merleau-Ponty, 1948), which is \nilluminated in our study, i. e., the students are evoked \nas lived bodies by the film and the learning context. \nFurthermore, Merleau-Ponty (1948) clarifies that “… \nI perceive in a total way with my whole being; I grasp \na unique structure of the thing, a unique way of being, \nwhich speaks to all my senses at once …” (p. 50). The \nfilm could speak to the students in a different way \nthan, for example, literature. This leads us to think of \nthe need to use all possible ways to explore and \nunderstand caring science and the students’ \nlifeworlds.  \n \nA film and a follow-up seminar can illuminate the \ncomplexity of human existence and can thus help the \nstudents to understand other peoples’ livingconditions,\nincluding contexts like culture and nursing \nstructures and the associated risks and possibilities, in \nrelation to caring. The students can become aware of \nhow they are intertwined in this complexity. This is \nimportant as the findings show that students are \nfrustrated by their inability to find easily understood \nrules concerning how to approach and help the \npatients. Students often ask for a certain structure or \n', 'Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology Volume 12    Special Edition July 2012 Page 8 of 12 \n \n \nThe IPJP is a joint project of the Humanities Faculty of the University of Johannesburg (South Africa) and Edith Cowan University’s Faculty \nof Regional Professional Studies (Australia), published in association with NISC (Pty) Ltd.

They have to start \nfrom the unique person and situation. Although the \nuse of nursing guidelines can give the impression of \nhigh-quality nursing, from our perspective we wonder \nhow quality is understood and how caring per se is \ncomprehended.  \n \nGalvin and Todres (2007) argue for the importance in \ncaring of a nurturing space for being-possibilities. \nThey argue that this should apply to a kind of \nscholarship that is a seamless movement between \nhead, hand and heart. This could mean that the \nongoing learning and opportunities within our \nprofessional and personal lives would be allowed to \n‘settle’ down. It is possible to argue that a learningsituation\nlike the one described in this study may well \nevoke the students’ lived bodies, with ‘head, hand and \nheart’ intertwined. This will allow them to experience \nhow human suffering can be shown and understood in \na way that relates to how this could be met in a \ncomplex world. The film illustrates lived experiences \nin ‘the teaching arena’, and this can serve as a \nvariation to the face-to-face encounter with patients, \nas well as other pedagogical strategies. \n  \nWhile watching the films the students’ do not have \nthe opportunity to ask questions and receive answers \nas in a conversation, instead they have to turn to their \nown understanding. This explains why the lifeworldled\nlearning context is of such a great value in helping \nthem in their search for answers. It is also important \nthat they come to understand that there are sometimes \nno answers and that this must be dealt with. The work \nof Merleau-Ponty (1969) helps in the understanding \nof this intersubjectivity and the possibility of \nunderstanding others. Merleau-Ponty (1969) writes of \nhow we observe others when we meet them, and how \nwe see and recognize their behaviour. When we \nrecognize the behaviour of others as being similar to \nour own then it is also possible to assume that their \nbehaviour is motivated by intentions that are similar \nto ours. Understanding of others is therefore grounded \nin their understanding of themselves, and vice versa, \nand as embodied and lived others (Merleau-Ponty, \n1969). This provides an understanding of how we, \nwith the help of a film, can develop a caring attitude \nthrough communication that is different from \nconversation.  \n \nThis leads to the question of how we can draw on \nphenomenology in teaching in general, and \nspecifically in this kind of learning-situation. In this \nkind of learning-situation, different meanings can \nemerge without the risk of hurting a patient, and the \nstudents are given an opportunity to understand the \nseamlessness of caring, as suggested by Galvin and \nTodres (2007). An open attitude and a problematizing \napproach as well as the willingness to dwell on the \nmeanings that emerge in the situation is characteristic \nof lifeworld-led learning. This can be a demanding \nlearning context for both teachers and students, but \nthe importance of the opportunities to learn cannot be \noveremphasised. A further important aspect also \nneeds to be noted. The students should not be driven \nto ‘solve the problems’, but instead should realize the \ncomplexity of understanding before there can be a \npossible solution.  \n \nThe students are stimulated to see a landscape of \nmeanings where they can be helped to focus on \ndifferent aspects of a whole. They can be helped in \nthis understanding by Merleau-Ponty’s (1945) notion \nof figure and background, which enables them to see \npatterns of meanings like a woven fabric and not as \nmere causality and problem-solving. Merleau-Ponty \n(1964) clarifies that the meaning of a phenomenon \ncannot be revealed to us in any other way than as a \ntotality and through its relationships with its \nparticulars.  \n \nThe results of this study show that film as a \npedagogical aid in courses in caring science may \nenable a deepened knowledge and may make the \nunderstanding of caring science more vibrant and \nvivid. This relates to what has been described by \nEkebergh (2001) as the transformation of ‘a lump of \nknowledge’; through pulling out a few threads or \nthrough integrating knowledge and practical \nexperiences students are provided with ‘ahaexperiences’.\nThis study has inspired the development of the course \noutlines in caring science in the nursing programme at \nLinnaeus University in Sweden. Each course intends \nto use film-seminars as a didactic tool to promote \nreflection and learning. This also provides an \nopportunity to understand more about how filmseminars\ncan be used in learning caring science. In \norder to accomplish a deepened knowledge in caring \nscience, a substantially incorporated scientific caring \nknowledge or a clear theoretical link to the seminar is \nrequired. This may be accomplished by the students \nreading fiction-literature or research in caring science \nprior to the seminar.  \n \nIn order to gain a deepened knowledge in caring \nscience, it is also vital that the teachers have the \nstudents’ learning in focus. Teachers should ask \nquestions to make the students more reflective. This is \nsimilar to the findings in previous studies, such as the \nstudy by Raingruber (2003), which is also based on \nlived experience. Thus, the lived experience in the \nfilm may contribute to a deepened knowledge of \ncaring.

The meaning of \npartaking in ‘the lived experience’ could be \naccentuated.  \n \nMethodological Considerations \n \nIn this reported study, we attempted to bridle our \nunderstanding, including our pre-understanding, and \nmet the data in manner that was as unspecified and \nopen possible (Dahlberg et al., 2008).  \n \nThe informants selected for our study were PhD \nstudents, Master’s students in caring science, and \nnursing students with diverse competences in caring \nscience. This diversity of the sample may be \nconsidered a strength of this study as it allowed for \nmany variations of the phenomenon to be in focus. In \nterms of implementation and innovation, the \nconditions in the learning situations have been \nchanged in relation to an expanded understanding of \nlearning, and the structure of the film seminars has \nbeen changed and developed as a result of this \nresearch.  \n \nThe data was collected over a period of two years. \nDuring this time-period, approximately eight \nadditional film-seminars were held where data was \nnot collected. However, these seminars were always \nevaluated and may be seen as part of the development \nof the project. The data collected took different forms, \nwhich allowed for the generation of rich meanings. In \naddition, we (the authors) acted as chairs of the \nseminars and collected all the data, thus playing a \ndouble role. Although this could be seen as a \nlimitation of the study, we argue that it has made it \npossible to develop the seminars further as we drew \non the experiences and evaluations for enhanced \nquality. \n \nConclusion \n \nFor optimal learning to take place we suggest that \nstructures based on a lifeworld perspective are \ncreated. This includes developing focus and aims \nwhen watching the film in relation to caring science \nas well as support for follow-ups. The students are \nthus guided in their reflection and are given support in \nusing ‘a caring science perspective’. In addition, the \nstudents need to be provided with support to help \nthem interlace theory and practice. The film by itself \ndoes not create such support and guidance, but must \nbe combined with well-considered pedagogical \nthoughts regarding what learning is and how learning \ncan be supported. It can be concluded that learning is \nan aspect of life and not a separated phenomenon. \nFilm can be used to clarify aspects of the human \ncondition such as health and suffering and the \nsubstance of caring science. In other words, under \noptimal learning conditions film may integrate theory \nand practice with the students’ lifeworlds. \n \nAdditional studies are needed to expand and further \ndeepen the knowledge of the phenomenon. However, \nthis study clearly demonstrates the potential of film as \na learning-support and could serve as a starting-point \nfor discussions of pedagogy in higher education. \n \n \n \n \nReferencing Format \n \nHörberg, U., & Ozolins, L.
