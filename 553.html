The \nbuilding corresponds to one of the most common traditional typologies: a terraced house with masonry load bearing brick walls and timber \nfloors, three storeys, a linear staircase attached to the party walls, a courtyard at the rear and a gable roof. In the past, this building, proved \nto be resilient, overcoming the risk of collapse in some important episodes which affected directly El Cabanyal: the air raid attacks of the \nValencian coastline settlements during the Spanish Civil War and the floods occurred in 1949 and in 1957. In 1988, the building was listed \nin the catalogue of the General Plan with a protection grade 3. The special protection plan (PEPRI 2001) which was supposed to protect \nand rehabilitate El Cabanyal, projected the extension of Blasco Ibañez Avenue to the sea and consequently, the division of the \nneighbourhood in two halves, tearing down an important number of houses. Subsequently, the City council began to expropriate buildings \nfacilitating their occupation by squatters. The level of degradation caused by the urban planning is such that this area is known as ‘Ground \nZero Area’. At the time of writing this paper, the building appears to be illegally occupied and in a bad state of preservation. After almost a \nhundred years facing different risks, poor urban planning appears to be the cause of the destruction of this heritage building. \n \n \n \n*  Corresponding author \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n1.1 Cabanyal quarter \n‘El Cabanyal’ is one of the old fishermen´s quarters in Valencia. \nThe origin of this historic settlement is set in the XIII century, \nafter the arrival of James I the Conqueror, King of Aragon, to \nValencia (which at that time depended officially on Caliph \nBagdad al Mustàmsir), defeating Valencian inhabitants on \nSeptember 28th, 1238 (Pastor, 2012). \n \nThe area developed in an independent village in which the \ninhabitants built their thatched fishermen's cabins (barracas) that \nused to line the beachfront. The grid pattern is one of the main \nvaluable characteristics of the quarter: main streets and housing \nblocks were, since the origin, organised parallel to the waterfront, \nwith an east to west orientation, allowing the houses to benefit from \nthe cooling easterly winds coming from the sea in the summer. \n \nAlong history, the development of the settlement was based on the \nrelationship with the sea and the growth of the economic activity \nof the harbour. During the 19th century, the Valencian harbour \nexperienced a growing commercial activity and was expanded. \nSubsequently, thanks to the withdrawal of the coastline, the quarter \ngrew parallel to the seashore. The fishing village soon became a \npopular zone for repose and leisure time. At the end of the century, \nsummer visitors of Valencia started to rent or buy the fishermen \nand dock workers’ houses, turning the area, named ‘El Cabanyal’, \ninto one of the neighbourhoods of the spreading city of Valencia in \n1897 (Figure 1). The old thatched fisherman’s huts were replaced \nby two and three-storey townhouses in the styles in fashion at that \ntime (mostly modernism but also baroque or eclecticism), while \nthe prosperous Valencian bourgeoisie built new villas at the \nseafront. The new façades were covered with brightly coloured \nceramic tiles in the style brought to Valencia by the Moors more \nthan 1,000 years ago. Because of its strong village-like identity and \nuniqueness, El Cabanyal was declared as Historical Artistic Site in \n1978 by the General Directorate of Artistic Heritage, Archives and \nMuseums of the Ministry of Culture (Pastor, 2012). \n \n1.2 Case study \nThe case study is focused on the residential building located at \n239 (Figure 2) Padre Luis Navarro Street, (nowadays 233). This \nbuilding has been selected as representative of many other Grade3\nlisted buildings built in the Cabanyal quarter before the Spanish \nWar. They have an environmental value, constituting the urban \nscene where Grade-1 and Grade-2 buildings are located. \n \nIts typology is one of the most common in the old fishermen \nquarter: a terraced house in a rectangular plot, with a linear \nstaircase attached to the party wall, a courtyard at the rear and a \ngable roof with the ridge parallel to the façade. A sketch of how \nthe distribution of the plan should be was proposed by Pastor \n(2012), corresponding to typology B (Figure 3). \n \nFigure 1. Cabanyal quarter.

Valencia was the \nthird most bombed city in Spain, being the harbour one of the \nmain air raid targets, because of its strategic value (Solé, 2003). \nFollowing the new strategy of frightening and demoralizing the \ncivilian population, the coastline settlements suffered countless \nattacks, not only from the sea but also from the air (Figure 4) \nkeeping the population under a constant threat. (Collado, 2017). \nAs a result of the above-mentioned air raids, this residential \nbuilding, like many others, was damaged.  \n \nAt the end of the war (1st April 1939), once the new regime was \nestablished, the Spanish cities started rebuilding processes.  \n \nTo proceed with the reconstruction of the damaged buildings, a \nrepair permit was requested. To apply for a repair permit and \nfinancial aid, a report on the assessment of damage suffered by \nthe buildings during the bombings and a reconstruction project \nwas compulsory. \n \nThe original Technical Report (in Spanish) and the Building \nPermit Application of the building under study (see original \nlocation plan in Figure 5) are shown in Figures 6 and 7, \nrespectively. In this report it can be read that, according to the \nArchitect Victor Gosálvez, the stairs were destroyed, as a \nconsequence of the bombing and both, internal walls and façade \nwalls, had cracks. The ceiling panels fell, and the roof was \ndamaged.  \n \nThe proposed intervention consisted in building new stairs, \nrepairing the cracks and the ceilings, fixing the roof, the gutters \nand the balcony and finally painting the façade. A note about \nthe compromise of using original materials was added at the end \nof the document signed in July 1941. \n \n \nFigure 4. Bombing of Valencia. Source: Peinado, 2015. \n \n \nFigure 5.

More \nthan 12,000 shops have been affected. More than 3,500 \nfamilies have been left homeless, more than 5,800 homes \nhave been destroyed, thousands of tons of mud have been \nleft in the streets and squares (Las Provincias, 1957).  \n \nDespite not having documented evidence about the effect that \nthis flood had in the building under study, Figures 8 and 9 show \nthat all the quarter was flooded, with the streets acting as rivers \ndraining the water into the sea. Graphic documents about some \nhouses in the Cabanyal quarter, totally destroyed by the flood, \ncan be seen in Figure 10. \n \nThe picture in Figure 11, taken in front of number 179 at Padre \nLuis Navarro street (next building block toward south) shows \nthat all the population, included the army, were involved in the \ncleaning of the tons of mud that covered streets, squares and \ngardens.  \n \nDespite the catastrophic flood, this building proved to be \nresilient, overcoming this natural risk. \n \n \nFigure 8.

URBAN PLANNING \n2.1 Expansion of the city at the end of the XIX century  \nIn 1853, Valencia, with more than 100.000 inhabitants, started \nits expansion, demolishing the medieval walls in 1865 and \ndrafting new planning proposals that followed the modern urban \ntheories at that time. According to these innovating ideas, \nseveral projects proposed to trace a wide boulevard to connect \nthe city centre with the beach, linked at that time only through \nthe Port’s Avenue. This new boulevard would receive the name \nof ‘Paseo al mar’ (meaning promenade to the seafront).  \n \nSome of the projects, planning the connection of the old town \nwith the Cabanyal neighbourhood and the beach, were drafted \nby Manuel Sorni Grau in 1865 (Boira, 2000), Casimiro \nMeseguer in 1883 or José Pedrós in 1931 (Pastor, 2012, Hervás \n2017). However, due to the lack of funding and the outbreak of \nthe Spanish Civil War in July 1936, none of these projects took \nplace. \n \nAt the end of the Spanish war, the reconstruction of the city \nstarted, and new general urban plans were drafted, bringing \nagain to light the connection of the city with the sea, without \ninvading, as in the previous proposals, the Cabanyal street \ntissue. \n \n2.2 The sixties: The housing bubble  \nAfter the 1957 big floods, once normal life rhythm was \nrecovered, a new General Plan was proposed, Plan General de \nValencia (1966). This plan was the starting point of the \ntypological and environmental degradation of El Cabanyal since \nit allowed unusual typologies in the area as well as an increase \nin the buildability and therefore, of the number of storeys \n(Pastor, 2012). \n \nThe connexion of the city with the seafront is an issue that \nremained unsolved after the end of dictatorship when \ndemocracy arrived. The extension of the boulevard through the \nold fishermen’s quarter and its preservation has been a \ncontroversial topic until the beginning of the XXI century.  \n \nOn the 22nd February 1978, a resolution of the General \nDirectorate of Artistic Heritage, Archives and Museums of the \nMinistry of Culture was published declaring six zones in \nValencia as Historical Artistic Sites, being El Cabanyal one of \nthem. Ten years later, in December 1988, the approved Plan \nGeneral de Ordenación Urbana de Valencia (hereinafter \nPGOU88) recognised El Cabanyal as Historical Artistic site and \ndeclared that a specific planning to regenerate the area and solve \nthe access from the city centre will be developed, preserving the \nbuilding typologies and the street patterns. A catalogue of the \nlisted buildings to be protected was included in the documents \nof the PGOU88. \n \nThe original core of the expansion of El Cabanyal was declared \nan Asset of Cultural Interest (BIC), by a decree of the Valencian \nRegional Government on May 3rd, 1993, because of the \narchitectural, urban, environmental and historical values. \n \nHowever, and despite the BIC declaration, on July 24th, 1998, \nthe local government started the draft of a special protection and \nrehabilitation plan which established the extension of ’Blasco \nIbáñez avenue’ (initially named ‘Paseo al Mar’) to the sea. This \navenue crossed El Cabanyal neighbourhood and divided it into \n2 halves, as shown in Figure 12a.  \nThis proposal implied tearing the grid pattern of the historical \nArtistic Site and the destruction of about 500 buildings, \ncomprising 1651 homes, (Hervás 2017) many of them listed \nwith the status of special protection in the PGOU88, as can be \nseen in Figure 12b. This plan was finally approved as Special \nProtection and Rehabilitation Plan PEPRI (Plan Especial de \nProtección y Reforma Interior del Cabanyal-Canyamelar) on \nApril 2nd, 2001. In this new proposal, the number of listed \nbuildings was significantly reduced, so that, none of them were \nincluded in the extension of the avenue invading El Cabanyal. \n \n \n \nFigure 12. a) PEPRI 2001 Proposal; b) Buildings to be \ndemolished (in black buildings listed by PGOU88). Source: \nHerrero 2016. \n \n2.3 XXI Century: City Council strategy and judicial \nappeals \nAccording to the Law of Valencian-Cultural Heritage \n(18/07/1998), the project of extending the Avenue Blasco Ibáñez, \nas planned in the PEPRI 2001, clearly contravened culture and \nlegislation but, above all, the will and way of life of the inhabitants. \n \nSeveral judicial appeals with opposite results came about \nregarding this plan, with Court decision, in some cases, in \nfavour of the neighbours and, in others, in favour of the local \nCity Council. The City Council took profit of this period and \ncreated public corporations which bought the buildings to be \ndemolished. The fact of being abandoned contributed to their \ndecline and led to their occupation by squatters and drug \ndealers. The affected area was degraded and began to be known \nas Cabanyal’s Ground Zero Area. In addition, the local and \nregional government modified the regional Law of ValencianCultural\nHeritage (19/7/2004) allowing the demolition of the \nbuildings in this area.  \n \nIn 2009, the implementation of the PEPRI 2001 was suspended \nby the Ministry of Culture, who demanded the plan to be \nadapted to guarantee the protection of the Historic artistic Site. \nAfter minor changes, in April 2010, the city council approved \nand started the demolition of the houses affected by the plan. \nWhen the Court stopped this action, about 125 houses had been \ndemolished, including 28 with the tiled style (Tarín, 2013). \n \nAfter the local elections in 2015, the new city council ended the \ndemolitions, repealing the PEPRI 2001 (July 2016). A new \nSpecial Protection Plan of El Cabanyal (hereinafter PEC) was \ndeveloped to protect and recover the affected area. The revised \nversion of this plan was exposed for public information in \nFebruary 2019 (Ayuntamiento de València 2019). \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLIV-M-1-2020, 2020 \nHERITAGE2020 (3DPast | RISK-Terra) International Conference, 9–12 September 2020, Valencia, Spain\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed. \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIV-M-1-2020-753-2020 | © Authors 2020.

CURRENT STATUS OF PADRE LUIS NAVARRO \nSTREET No. 233  \n3.1 Cadastral data \nAccording to the Cadastral Database (figure 13) the three-storey \nbuilding was built in 1923 and is divided into two independent \nproperties. A small dwelling (39 sqm) in the ground floor and a \nsecond one with direct access from the street in the first and \nsecond floors (77 sqm). The top view in this picture shows a \nsmall courtyard (1 sqm) and a one-floor construction at the rear of \nthe building. \n \nBeing the dimensions of the plot 3.40 x 11.5 m, it can be \nclassified according to Pastor (2012) as a ‘media escalá’, \nequivalent to half original plot. \n \nConsidering the constructions in the Cadastral Database, the \ndimensions of the plot, and the residential typologies studied by \nPastor (2012) a probable original plan distribution has been \ndrawn in figure 14a, with a 15m2 rear courtyard, while figure \n14b shows the current construction of the ground floor.  \n \n \nFigure 13. Cadastral file. Source: Cadastral Database. \n \n \nFigure 14. a) Probable original plan b) current plan. Credits: \nauthor’s proposal. \n \nHowever, considering the roof’s view in figure 15, where it is \nevident that the construction at the end of the courtyard has a \ndifferent roofing, it is possible that the courtyard was initially \ndesigned 3.4 m wide.  \n \n3.2 PEC data \nThe plans included in the initial information document of the \nPEC, state that: \n \n- the building is listed with a protection grade-3 (Figure \n16a) which means that having an environmental value, its \nfaçade and volume must be preserved.  \n- the maintenance state is bad (Figure 16b) \n- the number of inhabitants registered in the census is \nbetween 1 and 20 (Figure 16c) \n- the property is not public (Figure 16d). \n \nDespite being listed, no catalogue including the main features of \nthe buildings that must be preserved and the improper \nalterations to be reversed have been drafted yet. \n \n \nFigure 15.

Source: PEC 2019. \n \n3.3 In situ inspection \nOne of the first characteristics to be noticed in the inspection is \nthe number of storeys of the building under study (an aerial \nview of the block can be seen in Figure 17), specially compared \nto older buildings in the same block with only two storeys. \nBeing a common practice, at the beginning of the XX Century, \nto increase the number of floors of the existing buildings, both \nparty walls have been analysed (figure 19) concluding, contrary \nto what might initially be assumed, that it was initially built \nwith three storeys.  \n \nThe number of storeys and the year in which the aggregate’s \ndwellings were built, retrieved from the Cadastral Database, \nhave been drawn in figure 18.  \n \na) b)\nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLIV-M-1-2020, 2020 \nHERITAGE2020 (3DPast | RISK-Terra) International Conference, 9–12 September 2020, Valencia, Spain\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed. \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIV-M-1-2020-753-2020 | © Authors 2020.

The ground floor is \norganised with two independent entrances with different \ndimensions: on the right, the small door opens to the stairs \nleading to the first floor while the double door on the left opens \nto the ground floor household. \n \nThe same layout is repeated in the first floor, with a balcony \nconnecting both openings. Finally, the windows on the second \nfloor were designed with the same dimensions (Figure 19). \n \n \nFigure 17. Padre Luis Navarro st Aerial view.

Credits: The \nauthors, 2019. \nTo guarantee the conservation and enhancement of El Cabanyal, \npreserving the traditional art and crafts skills, the opening on the \nright side of the first floor should recover its original \ndimensions. Additionally, the following elements of the façade \nshould be preserved: \n \n1. The ceramic decorative frieze between the first and the \nsecond floor together with the green1 tiles and their \nbonding style (figure 20). These tiles and pattern can be \nseen in many buildings along the quarter (e.g. in the same \nblock at 209 and 219 Luis Navarro st and 196 Progreso st).  \n2. The ironwork of the balcony and windows. This design \n(figure 20) is repeated along the balconies and windows \nof the quarter. \n3. First floor blind protections. Being Valencia a \nMediterranean city, it was common practice to install \noutdoor wood chick blinds for blocking the summer sunlight \nheat. The houses of El Cabanyal used to protect these blinds \nwith wrought iron elements like those in figure 21. \n \n   \nFigure 20. Tiles and ironworks. Credits: The authors. \n \n \nFigure 21. Blinds’ protections. Credits: Street view 2008. \n \nFinally, it must be pointed out that at the moment of writing this \npaper, the house seemed to be inhabited by squatters with an \nappalling state of maintenance (Figure 19 and Figure 22), being \nthis condition similar to the adjacent houses which don’t seem \nto be in a better state (Figure 23). \n \nIn the building permit in Figure 7, it can be read that in 1941 the \nbuilding ownership of 233, Padre Luis Navarro street was \nshared between Mr. Beltran Vela’s heirs, being his eldest son, \nMr. Beltran Nicolau, who hired the architect. Mr Beltran \nNicolau was registered at Gobernador Moreno st, nowadays \nMediterráneo’s st (Claramunt, 2015), one of the main streets in \nEl Cabanyal quarter, confirming that El Cabanyal’s inhabitants \nwere fond of their quarter and wish to remain in the \nneighbourhood, being the irresponsible urban planning the main \ncause of abandon and decay. \n \nThe bad state of maintenance is one of the parameters which \ninfluence the seismic vulnerability of the building. With a \nvulnerability index value (VI) between 0.8 and 1, it has been \nclassified as vulnerability class B (Basset-Salom, GuardiolaVíllora,\n2020). Consequently, even though Valencia is located \nin a low-to-moderate seismic zone, the high vulnerability of this \nbuilding foresees important seismic damages in the occurrence \nof a seismic event. \n \n1 Pantone 351C or 344C \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLIV-M-1-2020, 2020 \nHERITAGE2020 (3DPast | RISK-Terra) International Conference, 9–12 September 2020, Valencia, Spain\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed. \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIV-M-1-2020-753-2020 | © Authors 2020.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper the case study of a residential listed building \nthreatened by natural and human induced hazards (as many \nothers in the quarter) has been presented.  \n \nThe building was built nearly 100 years ago with masonry \nbearing walls and timber floors, following the typologies at the \nmoment, at Padre Navarro Street in El Cabañal quarter of \nValencia (Spain). \n \nBeing a resilient building, it was able to recover from the \nSpanish War bombings and the 1957 catastrophic floods.  \nHowever, nowadays, its existence is at risk, due to the state of \ndegradation and decay, as a result of a poor redevelopment plan \nthat sentenced the residential buildings of Ground Zero Area to \ndemolition. \n \nNearly five years after the repeal of PEPRI 2001 some blocks in \nthe area have not been able to recover. Not being public tenures, \nthe retrofitting process is more difficult and slower. \n \nThe heritage of a residential neighborhood includes both, \nbuildings and their inhabitants, and neither of them should be \nneglected. Maintaining the residential use and, above all, the \nhomeowners, contributes to improve the quality and \nsustainability of the urban tissue. \n \nHeritage conservation strategies should identify, assess, protect \nand enhance the historic, cultural, and artistic values of the \nbuildings. Modern societies assume that damage in heritage \nbuildings can be caused by degradation or natural hazards, \ntherefore strategies to minimise its effects should be drafted. On \nthe other hand, this paper presents a human induced risk that \nthreatens the built environment producing decay and destruction.  \n \nThis building is an example that can be used as a reminder and a \ncomplaint addressed to politicians and urban planners about \nwhat should not be done. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis paper is related with the research project "RISK-Terra. \nEarthen architecture in the Iberian Peninsula: study of natural, \nsocial and anthropic risks and strategies to improve resilience" \n(RTI2018-095302-B-I00), funded by the Spanish Ministry of \nScience, Innovation and Universities. \n \nREFERENCES \nAlos, A., 2016.
