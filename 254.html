This opinion is based on the\nvery heavy bombardment of the Rus\nsian stronghold that occurred on Sep\ntember 16, for such a bombardment\nforms the usual prelude to an assault;\nthe arrival here of important mes\nsengers from Port Arthur at a time\nwhen the running of the blockade is\nextremely perilous; on a recent au\nthoritative statement that the Japan\nese siege works are completed, and on\nreports from Japanese sources that at\nPort Dalny an assault was expected\ntake place In a few days. These\nreports were received last week.\nIn addition to the foregoing there Is\nthe common knowledge that the Jap\nanese realize that their continued In\nactivity increases the resisting power\nthe Russian garrison and their con\nsequent desire is to make such a pe\nriod of inactivity as brief as possible.\nIt Is asserted in a dispatch from\nTokio to the London Dally Press that\nihe Japanese are vigorously shelling\nhe Russian defenses at Mukden, pre\napratory to a general assault, and en\ndeavoring by a wide turning move\nment to cut off General Kuropatkln\'s\nretreat. The Japanese armies, the\ndispatch adds, are disposed In the\nsame lelattve positions as in the fight\ning before Liaoyang.\nENCKE\'S COMET NOW VISIBLE.\nat\nity\nat\n24\nfor\nof\nat\nFamous Fiery Phenomena May Now\nBe Seen.\nEncke\'s famous comet is now ap\nproaching perihelion and is visible to\nInland Empire people with a telescope.\nThis comet Is famous In that it has\nIhe shortest period of recurrence,\nabout three and on-fourth years. It is\nlamed for Johann Franz Encke, a Ger\nman astronomer, who discovered the\nremarkable shortness of its period,\nbut the comet was really first observed\nby Pons, the famous French astrono\nmer in Marseilles in 1818. It has ap\npeared with great brilliancy on several\noccasions. Astronomers say that it\nwill again describe the long fiery tall\nresembling that of a fish that has char\nacterized its former appearances. B\nis gradually getting nearer and nearer\nthe sun, and the general belief is that\nwill one day fall into that body\nand be consumed.\nThe comet at the present time is in\nthe southern part of the constellation\nCetus, rising above the southeastern\nhorizon at about 7:45 in the evening,\nso that it is in good position for ob\nservation about 9:30 p. m., but is not\nvisible without the aid of a telescope.\nIt is slowly moving in a southwesterly\ndirection and will reach perihelion, or\nmake its nearest approach to the sun\nJanuary 3, 1905. It is noted as being\nnearest the sun of all known comets,\nas having the shortest period of re\ncurrence (3.303 years), and as having\nIts period shortened from two hours to\ntwo and one-half hours with each re\nturn to pehihelion.\nSINKS JUNKS OFF PORT ARTHUR\nJaps Roughly Handle Crews of Block\nade Runners.\nChinese, Russians and Japanese at\nChefoo all agree that the Japanese\nblockading Port Arthur are paying par\nticular attention to junks, which for\nmonths past have been trying to smug\ngle dispatches and supplies Into the\nfortress, and that when caught the\ncrews are roughly treated. The junks\ngenerally are sunk and the men on\nboard taken into Port Dalny. By\nmistake the Japanese sunk a junk\nwhich was carrylnk delicacies to Gen\neral Nogl from an admirer, but a part\nof the cargo was recovered. General\nNogl commands the Japanese besieg\ners. The Japanese are employing se\nvere measures in this respect, with the\nIdea of intimidating blockade runners.\nRussian civilians who have reached\nChefoo from Port Arthur say that can\nned corn beef is plentiful there, and\nthat the fresh meat supply consists of\n12 horses slaughtered daily.\nLife in the town, when no bombard\nment is going on, proceeds much as it\ndid in times of peace. Church services\nare held as usual in the dismantled\nchurch, and the band follows the usual\ncustom of playing in public twice\nweek.\nAll Russians there agree that the\nJapanese do not occupy any fort in\nthe inner line of defenses. The forts\nwhich were damaged have Been repair\ned almost as good as new during the\nquiet of the laBt 18 days. These Rus\nsians do not believe that the Japanese\nwill succeed in taking the fortress.\nTAKES BAG AND $20,000.\nBold Thief Walks Out of Bank With\nMoney.\nJust at the close of banking hours\nrecently a man in the lobby of the\nFirst National bank of San Francisco,\nobserving the cage door leading be\nhind the counter ajar, pushed it aside,\nwalked in and helping himself to a bag\ncontaining $20,000 in gold coin, made\na rapid exit. He Immediately slowed\ndown his pace and walked into a Bide\nentrance of the Brooklyn hotel, which\nleads to the dining room, closely fol\nlowed by 0. K. Macintosh, an employe\nof the bank, who had witnessed the\ntheft. Seeing that he was pursued the\nthief turned into the hotel office, where\nhe was overtaken\'and seized by Mac\nintosh. The bag was taken from him\nand its contents found to have been\nundisturbed. The daring robber suc\nceeded in escaping.\nThe world\'s sanity Is put Into\nkeeping of quiet lives.\nthe\nRussian* Fortify Tl* Pi\ncup* rat*. __\nThe past week waa one of inalRglty\nat the scene of war, so far as\nengagements were concerned. Kuro\npatkin was at Mukden, and a large\npart of als force was at work on the\nfortifications of Tie pass. The main\narmy of Oyama remained in the vicin\nity of ï entai, recuperating after the\nsevere work around Liaoyang and, de\nspite Russian surmises, evidently get\nting in form for another advance\nmovement. The Baltic fleet was re\nported to have sailed from Cronstadt,\nand the Russian auxiliary cruiser Lena\narrived at San Francisco.\nOn Monday Kuroki waa reported to\nhave fallen back to join the main army\nat Yentai, while on Tuesday it was\nsaid that a Japanese force was within\n24 miles of Mukden, but not moving\nnorth. Preparations by the Russians\nfor a resistance at Mukden continued,\nand work on the Tie pass fortifications\nwas pushed vigorously.\nKuropatkin\'s official report of the\nbattle of Liaoyang was made public\nWednesday, and the Russian comman\nder said that his losses were below\n17,000, of which 4500 were killed. The\nJapanese remained stationary, but\nwere reported to have taken over the\nlocal administration of the Manchu\nrian districts occupied by them.\nLate In the week work of dismantl\ning the Russian cruiser began at San\nFrancisco, and on Friday the Japanese\nwere reported as concentrating\nBensiaputze, about 20 miles southeast\nof Mukden. The larger part of the\narmy, however, was still at Yentai.\nWith the close of the week It was\nevident that another Japanese advance\nhad begun, an early report from Muk\nden yesterday announcing that the for\nward movement of Oyama waB from\nthe east, southeast and southwest. Out\nposts were closely engaged and there\nwas almost constant skirmishing. All\nthe indications point to another battle\nthis week, either at Mukden itself or\nat the strong positions to the north,\nhich the Russians have fortified since\ntheir retreat from Liaoyang.\nTHE PAST WEEK OF WAt\n8 pokane Retail Markets.\nVegetables—Potaties, 2@2%c lb;\nturnips, 3©5c bunch; rutabagas, 3c\nlb; dry onions, 4©5c lb; cabbage, 4©\n5c lb; celery, 2 bunches 6c; parsley,\n3@5c bunch; cucumbers, 5©8c each;\ngreen onions, 10@15c doz; radishes,\n5c bunch; rhubarb, 2©5c lb; green\npeas, 4©5c lb; new beets, 3 bunches\n10c; watercress, 5c bunch, string\nbeans, 8©10c lb; fresh carrots, two\nbunches 5c; mint, 5c bunch; tomatoes,\n3©6c lb; parsnips, 2 bunches 5c; can\nteloups, 3©5c each; cauliflower, 10©\n15c bunch; green peppers, 35©40c lb;\nwatermelons, 26@40c each; summer\nsquash, 5©10c each; crooked neck\nsquash, 5@10c each; green corn, 15©\n25c doz; egg plant, 10©15c ea; sweet\npotatoes, 6c lb; dewberries, 10c box;\ngarlic, 15c.\nFruits—Lemons, 25@30c doz; bana\nnas, 15@25c doz; oranges, 15@50c dz;\npineapples, 30©36c each; plums, 3©5c\nlb; grapes, 5@10c lb; pears, 6@10c lb;\npeaches, 3©6c lb; new apples, 4©5c\nblackberries, 10c box; peach plums\n10© 15c basket.\nPoultry—Dressed chickens, young\nchickens, 18c lb; -hens, 18c lb; old\nroosters, 14@16c lb; spring ducks, 60\nroosters, 14@16c lb; spring ducks, 60\n@70c each; goslings, 20c lb; spring\nchickens, 40@50c.\nDairy Products—Butter, best cream\nery, 30@35c lb; common creamery\n20©25c lb; best country, 20c lb; com\nmon country, 12%@15c lb; Imported\nSwiss cheese, 40c lb; American Swiss\ncheese, 25c lb; cream brick cheese, 18\n@25c lb; New York cheese, 20c lb;\nWisconsin cheese, 15c lb.\nEggs—New laid eggs, 25@30c doz;\neastern eggs, 20@25c doz.\nGrain and Feed—Timothy, 90@95c\ncwt; alfalfa, 85@90c cwt; oats, »1.45\ncwt; grain hay, 85@90c cwt; bran, 86\n@90c cwt; bran and shorts, 95c@$l\ncwt; shorts, $1.25 cwt; wheat, $1.40\ncwt; chopped barley, $1.30@1.35 cwt;\noil meal, 2Ygc lb; seed oats, $1.50 cwt.\nWholesale Produce Prices.\nNew potatoes, $1.25 cwt; summer\nsquash, $1 box; blackberries, $2©2.25\ncrate; peaches. 60@75c box; grapes,\n86c©1.25 crate; tomatoes, 40@60c bx;\ncucumbers, 60 box 20 lbs; onions, $1.75\ncwt; cabbage, $2 cwt; apples, 65c©\n1.24 box; plums, 50©60c crate; pep\nper8, 65c box; pears, $1©1.25 box\ncrabapples, $1 box; Rocky Ford can\ntaloups, $1.25 crate.\nWholesale Feed Prices.\nBran. $16 ton; bran and shorts, $1\nton; oats, $1.35 cwt; wheat, $1.20 cwt\nchopped corn, $1.60 cwt; whole corn\n$1.50 cwt; timothy hay, $16 ton; al\nfalfa hay $13 ton.\nPrices Paid to Producers.\nVegetables and FYults—Carrots and\nbeets, lc lb; string beans, 5c lb; pota\ntoes, $1 cwt; plump, 40c crate; apples,\n50©65c box; pears, 75c©$l box; on\nions, $1.25 cwt; cabbage, $1.25 cwt.\nPoultry and Eggs—Chickens, roost\ners, 10c lb; hens, 12@13c lb live wt;\nyoung chickens, $3©4.50 doz; turkeys,\ndressed, 18@20c lb; geese and ducks,\n12@14c lb; eggs, $5.75@6.50 case.\nLive Stock—Steers, $2.50@3 cwt;\nwethers, $3 cwt; hogs, $6 cwt; veal, $6\n6 cwt.\nHay—Timothy, $15 ton; alfalfa, $13\nton; oats, $1.10@1.20 cwt\nCreamery Products, f. o. b.

The suspicions have been in\ncreased by the commission of various\nacts by the soldiers of both armies un\ntil now even flags of truce or surren\nder are not respected by either side.\nPrince Radzivil declares that the\nmen of both armies are absolutely ve\nnomous in their antagonism. Lieu\ntenant General Stoessel has addressed\nhis garrison, saying that the present\nmood of the Japanese indicates clearly\nthe necessity of resisting them to the\nlast drop of Russian blood, because\nif the Japanese soldiers entered the\nfortress it undoubtedly wouid be im\npossible for their officers to control\nthem and prevent a massacre. For\nthis reason Lieutenant General Stoes\nsel is making no objections to civil\nians leaving Port Arthur. When the\n300 women who are in Port Arthur en\ngaged in hospital work were advised\nto leave they replied that they would\nrather face the possibility of massacre\nthan desert their posts.\nIn consequence of the fact that flags\nof truce are ignored, numbers of Jap\nanese dead which have been lying on\nthe slopes of the hills for weeks past\nare still unburled. The stench from\ndecomposing bodies when the wind is\nin the right direction is almost unen\ndurable. The Russian soldiers, who\nare in some cases posted only 50 paces\nfrom the heaps of decaying dead, have\nconstantly to wear over their noses\nhandkerchiefs soaked in camphor, aB\notherwise they would be unable to re\nmain at their posts.\nIn the course of the assaults which\ntook place in the four lust days of Au\ngust, two companies of Japanese sol\ndiers, according to Prince Radzivil,\nfound themselves at the mercy of the\nRussians and hoisted a white flag. To\nthis, however, the Russians paid no at\ntention and continued to fire volleys\nrapidly right into the heloless ranks\nof the enemy, while the Japanese\ntroops were in the rear of the compa\nnies that had raised the white flag\nlaw what their comrades had done and\nexpressed their disapproval of the sur\nrender by firing Into their rear. As a\nresult of the fire from friend and foe\n690 men were annihilated. The dead\nfell among the decomposing bodies of\nprevious assaults. For days after\nwards the wounded men In this area\nraised fluttering handkerchiefs in their\nhands in plea for help, but the Rus\nsians were afraid to venture out to\ngive succor. Within a week the last\narm had made its last unregarded\nprayer for help and the shambles was\na quiet but ghastly field of horror.\nAmong the heaps of dead the prince\nsaw two soldiers, one a Russian and\nthe other a Japanese, lying locked in\na death embrace. The teeth of the\nJapanese were sunk in the Russian\':,\nthroat, while the Russian had forced\ntwo >f his fingers into the eye sockets\nof his antagonist. The prince cited\nthis as merely an incident denoting the\nferocity of the conflict before Port Ar\na\nT.\nat\nis\nbe\nure\nall\nan denoting\nferocity of the conflict before Port Ar\nthur.\nHow Radzivil Got Away.\nPrince Radzivil, another Russian of\nficer, two civilians and one woman, the\nwife of a Russian staff officer, left\nPort Arthur the night of September\n16, on a junk and have arrived here.\nPrince Radzivil got into Port Ar\nthur a fortnight ago.\nPlenty of Food and Ammunition.\nIn his interview with the correspon\ndent, the prince said:\n\'The stories in circulation concern\ning the shortage of ammunition and\nprovisions at Port Arthur are not true.\nThere if an abundance of ammunition\nfor both large and small arms, and\nplenty ci preserved food. The use of\nChinese shells was merely a saving\nmeasure.\n"I left Lieutenant General Stoessel\nin the best of spirits. He is encour\naged by the heroic example set by the\nwounded men, of whom 5000 out of the\noriginal 8000 in hospital have returned\nto the front.\n\'There has been no fighting since\nSeptember 1, with the exception of\nartillery and outpost exchanges. The\nJapan.jte shells, however, have done\ngreat damage to the hospital and other\nbuildings in Port Arthur, but the loss\nof life from the bombardments have\nbeen very light.\nHead of Red Cross.\nMme.

The end\nwas painless.\nSince he ceased to be foreign min\nister on the retirement of his father\nIn 1890, Prince Henry Bismarck had\ntaken part in public affairs only as a\nmember of the reichstag. His atti\ntude had been more of a man not ap\npreciated by his sovereign, and who\nis waiting in .the background for an\nopportunity to resume his career.\nHis delivery as a parliamentary\nspeaker improved year by year. He\nalways declined to join any political\ngroup, steadfastly calling himself an\nindependent. His hauteur and impe\nrious manners in early life, when be\nwas overconscious of the fact that he\nwas tne son of the most powerful\nstatesman in Europe, Boftened in later\nlife.\nPrince Bismarck\'s father trained him\nfor his successor as chancellor of the\nGerman empire and advanced him\nrapidly in the diplomatic service un\ntil, at the age of 40, he was minister\nof foreign affairs, in which position he\ntook part in nearly every Important\nnational incident.\nElopement With a Princess.\nAn incident that nearly wrecked\nPrince Bismarck\'s career and that\ncaused the old chancellor annoyance\nwas Prince (then count) Herbert\'s\nelopement with Princess Caïblath\nBeuthen, the wife of Prince Karl, the\nhead ot that distinguished Silesian\nhouse. Prince Bismarck at that time\nwas his father\'s private secretary.\nCount Herbert lived with the princess\nIn southern Italy for a few weeks, and\nthen, at the command of hlB father,\nreturned to Germany. The princess\nwas divorced and has since died.\nThe title of Prince Bismarck and\nthe large fortune of the deceased will\ngo to his seven year old son, Otto.\nThe late Emperor Frederick gave\nto Chancellor Bismarck extensive at\nFriedrichsruh, which have since in\ncreased in value, and the chancellor\ngave to Prince Herbert $2,400,000 in\nsecurities and cash.

The ex\nperience of the Russo-Japanese war\nhas convinced the general board that\nIn the future the great naval battles\nmay be fought at night and it is cer\ntain that most of the torpedo work\nwill be done in the hours of darkness.\nHence it is believed to be essential\nto develop the gun pointers at night\nwork and already surprising results\nhave been obtained in the practice in\nthe night. Using her eight inch guns\none of the battleships made eight hits\nout of nine shots at night The target,\ndistant about a mile, was illuminated\nby a searchlight and the gunners used\na special night sight. The Bhlp from\nwhich this shooting was done was forg\ning ahead in the open sea at 10 knots.\nHalifax Has Another Fire.\nHalifax, N.
