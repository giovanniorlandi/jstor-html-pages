The Russians made a sudden\nattack in the darkness on the Japanese\noutposts. The Japanese casualties\nANOTHER BATTLE REPORTED\nRussians Make Sudden Attack on Japanese\nOutposts—Narrowly Escape Being\nSurrounded by Japs.\nCLEVELAND GETS AN OVATION\nSt. Lewis, July 7.—The Democratic\nQational convention was called to or\xad\nder shortly after noon by Chairman\nJones of the national committee. The\nattendance of delegates and visitors\nwas larger than at any recent national\ngathering of the party and the de\xad\nmand for seats could not be supplied.\nLittle enthusiasm was shown by the\ncrowd in the hall during the arrival of\n"the party leaders. David B. Hill came\nIn for considerable applause, but Will\nlam J. Bryan entered unnoticed. The\nmention of Cleveland\'s name during\nthe speech of Temporary Chairman\nWilliams caused the first real outburst\nof enthusiasm and the speaker was un\xad\nable to proceed for several minutes.\nIt was 12:03 p. m. when Chairman\n7. K. Jones of the national committee\ncalled the convention to order. His\nappearance on the platform and the\nBound of his gavel brought forth a\ncheer from the floor and galleries.\nChairman Jones directed the ser\ngeant-at-arms to maintain order. He\ncontinued belaboring the table witn\nhis gavel, but it was some time betore\nbe was recognized. California\'s ap\xad\npearance witn silk badges and a great\nbanner labelled "Hearst" caused cheer\nlug. Just as the California ueiegauou\nreached its piace aiier maiuii^ u±,\naftd down the center aisie W. &*i,\nwho had come in unnoticed, aioss in\nbis place ana was given a cnee..\nDemonstration Follows a Mention of Grover\nCleveland\'s Name at the St. Louis\nConvention\nThen an enterprising meiuuer of the\nftiontaua delegation cieateu a aive»\nfeion by vigorously ringing a cow beu.\nAgain Chairman Jones demanuea\nthat the convention be in order anu at\nonce directed that the secretary read\nthe call for the convention. Rev. Can\xad\nnon, pastor of the Grand Avenue bap\xad\ntist church, St. Louis, then offeied\nprayer.\nEnthusiastic cheering greeted the\nchairman\'s announcement that he was\ndirected by the national committee to\nappoint John S. Williams temporary\nchairman, C. A. Walsh temporary sec\xad\nretary and John 1. Martin temporary\nBergeant-at-arms.\nThe chairman appointed Colonel J.\nM. Guffey of Pennsylvania and M. F.\nTarpey of Calitornia to escort Mr.\nWilliams to the chair. As the plat\xad\nform was enclosed by a railing it was\nnecessary tor the committee and Mr.\nWilliams to climb over the railing.\nThe committee lifted Mr. Williams\nover and the entire convention burst\nInto cheers as he ascended the plat\nform.\nCONGRESSMAN WILUAM8\nTEMPORARY CHAIRMAN.\n"I have the honor to introduce to you\nJohn S. Williams as temporary chair\xad\nman," said Chairman Jones, and again\nthe convention cheered.\nMr. Williams was attired in a light\ngray suit and a white waistcoat. He\ndelivered his address calmly and with\xad\nout gestures. Several cries of "Loud\xad\ner, louder," interrupted Mr. Williams\nas he began, his clear but not powerful\nvoice at first failing to reach all parts\nof the hall.\nAs Mr. Williams proceeded his voice\nIncreased in volume and the delegates\nlistened attentively.\nThe convention appeared consider\xad\nably amused at Mr, Williams\' humor\xad\nously sarcastic references to the "Mu\xad\ntual Admiration society" of Mr. Roose\xad\nvelt and Mr. Root, and when he read\nan eulogy by the president on Mr. Root\nthe delegates laughed and applauded.\nMr. Williams spoke in an Ironical\ntone that caught the fancy of the con\xad\nvention and he was interrupted time\nand again by laughter.\nCheering was evoked by the speak\xad\ner\'s statement that Mr. Roosevelt had\nfound praise for only three presidents\n—George Washington, Abraham Lin\xad\ncoln and himself—and when he tasked\nthe "Hell-roaring Jake Smith" or\nMer was a sample of the moral senti\xad\nment for which the Republicans stood\na\nlUBty\ncheer broke forth.\nA great part of Mr. Williams\' speech\n\'tras delivered under great difficulties\nfor the speaker and those of his hear\xad\ners who were supposed to be most di\xad\nrectly Interested lit his remarkB. The\naisles leading past the delegates were\npacked by dense throngs, who kept up\na constant hum. of conversation that\nsmothered Mr. Williams\' voice. -Sev\xad\neral times the speakerstopped and\nasked that the talking cease In order\nthat be might make himself better un\xad\nderstood.\nMr. Williams drew a picture of the\naountrv\'s condition at tbq t)$£ of Pres\n.Vr/s\'tffe $\nW\nare reported to be one thousand.\nStrong Japanese reinforcements came\nto the aid of the Japanese but were\nrepulsed. Finally the Japanese made\na flank movement and the Russians\nnarrowly escaped being surrounded.\nWent Cleveland\'s first Inauguration, de\xad\nclaring that most of the disasters that\ncame in the early \'90s were due to Re\xad\npublican misrule which had gone be\xad\nfore. Under President Benjamin Har:\nrison for three years, he said, all hopes\nhad well nigh vanished from the busi\xad\nness world. He scored the attitude of\nthe Republican party on the financial\nquestion, declaring it had been full of\ninconsistencies and absurdities. He\nmentioned the name of Mr. Bryan in\ndiscussing the price of wheat during\nthe first Bryan-McKinley campaign.\nThe utterance of the name called for\nlittle applause and some cheers. A\nsecond later he mentioned the name\nagain and the applause was not re\xad\npeated.\nCLEVELAND\'S NAME CAUSES\nPROLONGED DEMONSTRATION.\nA mention of the name of Grover\nCleveland was cheered lustily. A mo\xad\nment later the first scene of the ses\xad\nsion occurred. Mr. Williams declared\nthat it was brazen effrontery for the\nRepublican party to attempt to seize\nthe laurels of Grover Cleveland. A\ngenuine outburst of applause followed.\nCheer after cheer rose throughout the\nhall and although the chairman used\nthe gavel vigorously the convention\nwas soon beyond his control.\nNew Hampshire delegates climbed\nupon their seats and yelled vigorous\xad\nly. One Iowa man of the Hearst in\xad\nstructed delegation from that commu\xad\nnity\nBtood\nup and waved his hand\nfrantically and a wild chdrus answered\nhim.\n"Three cheers for Grover Cleveland,"\nshouted an Alabama delegate and they\ncame with genuine power and enthu\xad\nsiasm. No cry came from Nebraska,\nwhere Mr Bryan and his friends sat\nquietly without taking part in the\nnoise. Again and again the cheers rang\nout in dense volume despite numerous\ncries ot "Order" and the strenuous\npounding of the chairman\'s gavel.\nThen Mr. Williams sat back and\nwatched the scene he had created. As\nthe cheers and cries fell there would\nbe a renewed outbreak and the demon\xad\nstration lasted eight minutes.\nTim Murphy of St. Louis, standing\nin the center aisle and encouraging\nthe demonstration, was first requested\nto take his seat and then ejected from\nthe hall by John 1. Martin, sergeant\nat-arms. Murphy was rushed towards\nthe platform by Martin, through a rail\xad\ning and down a narrow stairway lead\xad\ning under the stage.\nAnother encounter between Murphy\nand Martin took place in the passage\xad\nway under the stage. Murphy then\npermitted himself to be taken from\nthe hall by two officers.\nFor several minutes after the Mur\xad\nphy incident the demonstration con\xad\ntinued. Finally, in desperation, Mr.\nWilliams threatened to discontinue his\nspeech.\n"You have placed me here I am\nyour servant. If you don\'t want me to\ncontinue it is your pleasure/\' he cried.\nThis announcement was effective\narid Mr. Williams secured control, the\ndemonstration that his mention of\nCleveland had caused dying slowly\nout. When he said that he had thought\nDewey, Schley and Miles were Demo\xad\ncrats, that a Republican administra\xad\ntion had snubbed the first, tried to dis\xad\ngrace the second and insulted the\nthird, the convention broke out into\napplause.\nBy this time Mr. Williams\' voice was\nfailing. It grew weaker and he was\nbeard with difficulty even by those\nvery near the platform.\nMr. Williams\' flow of oratory was un\xad\ninterrupted for some time. A response\nof applause followed his denunciation\nof the Republican claims of prosperity\nbecause of the tariff. Cries of louder\nwere again heard in various parts of\nthe hall.\nGREAT DISORDER DURING\nLAST PART Of SPEECH.\nMr. Williams then discussed the race\nquestion, but the noise was so great\nbe could scarcely be heard on the plat\xad\nform. He concluded his address great\xad\nly exhausted. As he finished, aftcir\nspeaking for one hour: and forty min\xad\nutes, the band struck up a medley Of\npatriotic aire, the stirring strains of\n"Dixie" calling forth the wild cheer\nthat never fails to follow the song, no\nmatter when or where rendered.\n"The delegates are invited to visit\nthe exposition," said Mr. Williams,\n"and the clerk will read the invita\xad\ntion."\nThe last few words, vera-lost in\n11\n»3 \'«\'ir A\nm™r\n¥i -vf\'tTv\nW\n"i\ncrres of "Bryan,"\' "Bryan,\' tiiat came\nswift and thick from different parts of\nthe hall.\nCheers mingled with the calls and\nit was fully a minute before the voice\nof the clerk was abie to rise aoove u»e\ntumult. Mr. Bryan remained quietly\nin his seat during the demonstration\nmade by his friends and gave no out\xad\nward sign oi his recognition of the ap\xad\nplause that had greeted his name.\nDelegate Powers of Michigan was\nrecognized by Chairman Williams to\nreturn the thanks oi the convention\nto the exposition officials for\'the cour\xad\ntesy shown and made a brief speech of\nacknowledgment.\nWhen the ticket passers had nearly\nfinished their task the chairman an\xad\nnounced that the roll of states would\nbe called, each state as its name was\ncalled to send up to the chairman\'s\ndesk the names of its committeemen\nselected in caucus.\nWhile the roll call was in progress\nthe spectators, concluding that the in\xad\nteresting scenes of the convention\nwere finished for the day, streamed out\nby thousands. The noise of their exit\nand the talking throughout the hall\nwas so general that the clerks could\nbe heard with great difficulty. The\nannouncement of Mr. Bryan as a mem\xad\nber of the resolutions committee from\nNebraska called forth a cheer from\nsuch of his friends as were, able to\nSt. Louis, July 7.—The second day\'s\nsession of the democratic national con\xad\nvention was called to order at 10:13.\nAfter prayer tlhe report of the commit\xad\ntee oni rules was read and adopted.\nBAILEY IS AGREED ON.\nTexan Will Be Permanent Chairman\nof Convention.\nSt. Louis, July 7.—Senator Hill has\nannounced that United States Senator\nBailey of Texas had been agreed upon\nfor permanent chairman of the con\xad\nvention. Outside of this announce\xad\nment there has been but little doing at\nNew York\'s headquarters during the\nmorning, except a demand by 400 Tam\xad\nmany braves for seats in the conven\xad\ntion hall, a demand which National\nCommitteeman Mack could not gratify.\nSenator Grady of New York appealed\nto Senator Hill, but the latter told him\nhe could not assist him. Then Senator\nGrady accused the Hill people of bad\nfaith and said they were purposely\nkeeping out the Tammany people tc\nprevent applause for any other candi\xad\ndate than Parker.\nLQ8S OF OVER S1.000,00a\nValuable De-\nv-\'\nCottage and Contents\nstroyed by Fire.\nNew York, July 7.—In the Are which\nhas destroyed the Cammack cottage\nat Tuxedo Park, N.

Creden=\ntial Committee Not Ready to Report.\nHAYTI\'S EXPLANATION.\nAttack on Foreign Ministers Deprived\nof Its Seriousness.\nWashington, July 7.—Mr. Lege.-, the\nHaytian minister, has made an ex\xad\nplanation of the recent inte:national\nepisode at Port au Prince, involving an\nattack on the French and German min\xad\nisters and the presence of warships in\nconsequence to procure repa. ation,\nwhich throws an entirely different\nlight on the situation, depriving it of\nany such anti-foreign animus as was\nat first attributed to it. The minister\'s\nadvices received from Hayti show that\nthe incident occurred as follows:\n"At the executive mansion at Port\nau Prince there is a road which is\nclosed after dark to all pedestrians\nand carriages. On the evening of June\n21 two carriages were seen on that\nroad. It was dark, the gentry could not\nsee the occupants of the carriages and\ncould not then know if they were for\xad\neigners or natives. The coachman,\nnot hearing or not taking any notice\nof the warning of the sentry, the latter,\nto avoid using his rifle, thought fit to\nthrow a stone in the direction of the\ncarriages. When, the next morning,\nthe report was made the occupants of\nthe carriages were the French and\nGerman ministers, the officers of the\nguard and the sentry were punished\nand the secretary for exterior relations\ncalled at both legations to express re\xad\ngret and apologize in the name of the\ngovernment."\nJAPS LOSE A GUNBOAT\nTokio, July 7.—The Japanese gun-1 in Talienwan Bay July 5th.\nboat Kaimon struck a mine and sunk I\nJtoilti @rilmnc«\nnear tne announcement.

The motion was adopt\xad\ned and the convention adjourned at\n2:50 p. m.\nOPPOSITION WEAKENING.\nAdmits Parker\'s Nomination on First\nBallot Is Possible.\nSt. Louis, July 7.—The advocates of\nthe various candidates for president\nwere astir early, but those who were\nadvocating the claims of other candi\xad\ndates than Judge Parker found very\nlittle encouragement. Some of them\ncontinued their assurances that there\nwould be at least 400 votes cast against\nthe New York candidate and professed\nto be undaunted by the stand taken by\nPennsylvania and Ohio. Others ad\xad\nmitted the critical nature of the situa\xad\ntion and confessed that great effort is\nnecessary to prevent Parker\'s nomina\xad\ntion on the first ballot.\nAfter a protracted contest the Mich\xad\nigan delegation decided to cast its\nvote for Parker. The Maryland dele\xad\ngation, at a meeting during the day,\ndecided to vote for Parker.\nThe opening afternoon session of the\nconvention was delayed1 by an ovation\nto Bryan on his entrance to the hall.\nAfter a demonstration had lasted sev\xad\neral minutes the Parker mem tried to\noff set it by starting a counter one\nfor the New Yorker. Order was not\nrestored for more than half an hour.\nThe convention is waiting for the re\xad\nport of the credentials committee.\nThe resolutions committee will not re\xad\nport today.\nSTOPPED BY BLANK SHOTS.\nPorte Apologizes for Firing on Russian\nVessels.\nConstantinople, July 7.—It trans\xad\npires that the Russian volunteer fleet\nsteamer St. Petersburg, which passed\nthrough the Bosphorus from the Black\nsea during the morning in company\nwith the Sevastopol, the latter flying\nthe Red Cross and with her hull paint\xad\ned white, was stopped in the Bospho\xad\nrus by blank shots from the Turkish\nforts, fired without previous warning.\nThe incident threatened to cause\nfriction but, after a delay of several\nhours, explanations were exchanged\nbetween the Russian embassy and the\nporte. The vessel then was allowed to\nproceed, Vladivostok being declared\nher destination.\nBY IMPERIAL UKASE.\nRemainder of Russian Naval Reserves\nCalled Out.\nSt. Petersburg, July 7.—All the re\xad\nmaining naval reserves in the govern\xad\nments of European Russia, with the\nexception of Orenburg and Finland,\nhave been called out by an imperial\nukase.

Othei\nDARING FEAT OF JAPANESE\nTORPEDO BOATS ENTER PORT AR\xad\nTHUR HARBOR BUT FAIL TO\nSINK ANY VESSELS.\nSt. Petersburg, July 7.—A few nights\nago Admiral Togo attempted to repeat\nthe Japanese exploit with torpedo\nboats at Weihaiwei during the Chino\nJapanese war by sending torpedo boat\ndestroyers into the harbor of Port Ar\xad\nthur for the purpose of sinking ships\nat their anchorage, but the attempt\nended in disastrous failure. Four tor\xad\npedo boat destroyers succeeded in\ncreeping into the harbor, which was\nnot protected by booms, but not one\nescaped. The reckless bravery of the\nJapanese in going to almost certain de\xad\nstruction excites nothing but admira\xad\ntion here. On account of the difficulty\nof getting i.^D the harbor the feat is\nconsidered iu naval circles to be fully\nas daring as that of the Japanese at\nWeihaiwei, where Japanese torpedo\nboats, in a storm and covered with ice,\nwere jumped over the booms protect\xad\ning that harbor and destroyed Chinese\nwarships. As far as known the Jap\xad\nanese torpedo boat destroyers did not\neven succeed in launching torpedoes.\nThe exact date of the attack is not\nascertainable, but it is said to have\noccurred Saturday. No further details\nare obtainable. Though it is believed\nother destroyers participated in the\nattack only four, however, succeeded\nin getting in. The method whereby\nthis information leached the authori\xad\nties is not disclosed.\nDEMAND A CLOSED SHOP.\n•Twenty-two Hundred Chicago Garment\nWo kers cr.

This change was\nmade that farmers who would be busy\nharvesting on September 1st may at\xad\ntend. Among those prominently men\xad\ntioned for the gubernatorial nomina\xad\ntion is\' Hon. I. P. Baker of Bismarck.\nHe is not only an old resident of Da\xad\nkota but has always been prominently\nidentified with its business interests,\nchief among which were steam boating,\nranching, coal mining and banking.\nHe is active, aggressive, capable and\npopular.\nThe Minot Optic is feeling good\nhearted again, and eays: "Political\nof liberality and patriotism was ndcely\nMinot\'s celebration.

There is too little\nlire and let live. In politics it is all\nrig!ht to fight hard—if it is done hon\xad\norably—but when victory perches upon\nthe banner of one set of leaders there\nshould be no personal animosity on\neither Bide. Patrotism should triumph.\nIt did on the Fourth."\nThe questions of landseekers\' rates\nto the Northwest will be the chief sub\xad\nject of the western passenger associa\xad\ntion Monday at Houghton, Mich.

They come\non an official visit, representing the\nGreat Priory of England and Wales,\nof the United Order of Great Britain\nand of Ireland, and as personal repre\xad\nsentatives of Ring Edward VII of\nEngland, and the Duke of Connaught.\nIt is the first time in the history of\nTemplarism that such distinction has\nbeen conferred upon the Grand En\xad\ncampment of the United States by so\ndistinguished a delegation. The honor\nis doubly appreciated because the visi\xad\ntors cross an ocean and a continent\nto attend the Templar Conclave, show\xad\ning a desire to bring the two supreme\nbodies into closer relation. The party\nwill be headed by the Most Eminent\nand Supreme Grand Master of the\nGreat Priory of England and Wales,\nthe Right Honorable the Earl of\nEuston, Grand Cross Templar Sir\nCharles E. L. Wright, Past Great\nPrelate Sir Abraham Woodlwiss,\nKnight Commander of the Temple\nSir Thomas Phipps Dorman, Knight\nCommander of the Temple Sir Alfred\nJames Thomas and Sir Thomas Fraser,\nKnights Templar of high degree.

Three large parlors\nand fburteeni suites have been re\xad\nserved for them. Their reception and\nliving rooms will be decorated and ar\xad\nranged with a lavish display of Cali\xad\nfornia\'s choice flowers, so abundant at\nall seasons, and the decorations will\nbe changed each day with fresh flow\xad\ners coming from different parts of the\nstate. The guests\' will be assigned the\nplace of honor in the great Templar\nparade, which is to be one of the most\nimposing spectacles ever witnessed in\nthe United1 States. A banquet and re\xad\nception will be given in their honor,\nand they will be escorted on excur\xad\nsions to places of interest in the inter\xad\nior and up and down the Coast. Dur\xad\ning their stay the California fraters\nwill endeavor to show them as much\nof California and of the Pacific slope\nand the many natural wonders In\nwhich* that section abounds, as possi\xad\nble, and will impress the visitors with\nthe resources of California, Oregon,\nWashington and the Pacific states, and\nat the same time give them a taste of\ntrue western hospitality.

All encouragement\nthen to Norris and Rowe who bring\nthis to our very doors. These enter\xad\nprising showmen in their zeal to out\ndo all others, have each year gone to\ngreater and greater expense until their\nbig show is now known as the Norris\nand Rowe Greater Circus, for circus\nit is in all the name implies. Every\xad\none lives upon the encouragement they\nreceive and if it were not for the en\xad\ncouragement gained by liberal attend\xad\nance and applause of their efforts,\nNorris and Rowe would not be in a po\xad\nsition to give us such vast entertain\xad\nment.

He was struck in the\nhead, a large gash appearing on his\nforehead, and was apparently injured\ninternally. His injuries rendered him\nunconscious for some time and Dr.\nTaylor was called.
