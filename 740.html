When\ntee late Kuropatkin was surprised and had te\nretire se quickly that it was necessary te burn\nmuch of the supplies saved after the ovacm evacm ovacm\ntien of Mukden. The Associated Press dis\npatches sent from just abeve Tie Pass befere\nthe latter place was evacuated indicate that\nthe Russians are short of supplies. Before the\nevacuation Kuropatkin bad prepared entrench\nments at Tie Pass, which is the key te a valley\nwhich epens out in fan shape.

Possibly\nthe most important news, greater than that of\nthe evacuation of Tie Pass, is the announce\nment that the Japanese en March 13th cap\ntured Sinkching (Singking), or Yenden. This\nis about eighty miles due East of Mukden, and\nthe Japanese can whirl direct te the railroad,\nwhich runs Northeast, and cut off the Russians\nSeuth of Kerin.
