He\nimmediately issued instructions to lift "the rules prohibiting trans,\nmission of messages containing libelous matter, so far as messages\nreferring to the Postmaster General are concerned.\n\' But the deed had been done and the tyrannical possibilities of\nGovernment ownership and operation of telegraph lines had been re\nvealed. The Nw York World is an influntial newspaper of great finan-\noiol .miiiii Tf nan liif linvt in a ftfrlit T)ini\'ff nfn Aft\' Tlnrlflsnn lnil-\ndescends to let it use the telegraph in its criticism of his administra\ntion. But What if Mr. Burleson\'s critic had been ofte less wealthy,\nless influential, some obscure newspaper or periodical of greater in\ndignation than power t Would Mrfl Burleson have been so quick in\ncondescension! Or, if Mr. Burleson were more deeply entrenched\nin power and the question of Government ownership and operation of\nthe telegraphs had been settled, would even the New York World\nhave been permitted to transmit its argumentative matter, termed\nlibelous by Mr. Burleson!\n0 ., Knowing Mr. Burleson\'s record as a petty politician turned im\nperial autocrat, we are inclined to the view that it is only the fact\nthat Government ownership is a present political issue which pre.\nvents him from quietly sitting on the NewVYork World\'s case, find\ning that newspaper guilty, and using the heavy hand of the entire\npostal department to visit vengeance upon its head.

While John Jones might\nthink of it as a contribution to a greater neighborliness to remove\ntHe fence that distinguished the domain of the John Joneses from\nthat of the Prank Smiths, living next door, it is conceivable that he\nmight hesitate about removing the fence, if, in doing so, he at the\nsame time rplinnnishpn1 tn Frank Xtnitli n vno nn Imir Vn .T..nD\nshould cook the breakfast baeon and eggs, or let neighbor Smith\'s\nhungry cows and chickens into the Jones vegetable garden.\'\n- Francis Burton Ilarrison is an exception not to say a freak. lie\nrecommends the abolition of his own job of Governor General of the\nPhilippines.

A dead hog is dangerous to all\nthe other hogs on the same farm and\nto every hog In the State.\nThe College of Agriculture at Lex\nington recommends that all dead ani\nmals should be thoroughly burned or\nburled deep. As burning a body un\ntil only the ashes remain Is a difficult\nmatter, burying Is much simpler. How\never, the farmer should remember\nthat a shallow covering of earth will\nnot keep dogs from the dead body. At\nleast 5 feet of earth should cover the\ndead animal after a liberal Supply of\nquicklime has been sprinkled over the\ncarcass.\nWITH HIM FOR LIFE\nFor most of us tho war Is over.

Brown of the\nChamber of Commerce of the United\nStates, speak on "Why a Community\nShould Support Its Chamber of Com\nmerce." Just before the address, a most en\njoyable concert was rendered by the\nBoys\' Band. Many citizens who had\nnot yet heard the Boys\' Band and were\nhighly pleased with the results that\nhave been obtained under the efficient\nleadership of Prof. J. W. Young.\nPresident Cochran, of the Maysville\nChamber of Commerce took charge of\nthe meeting and expressed the citi\nzens\' appreciation of the efforts being\nput forth by the boys of the band, their\nparents and the band committee and\nassured them that it would not be long\nbefore they would have the deserved\nuniforms.\nMr. Cochran then Informed the\nmembers that the local Chamber of\nCommerce holds membership In the\nChamber of Commerce of the U. S. of\nAmerica which is considered the par\nent of the commercial organizations of\nthe United States and It was through\nthis connection that we were fortunate\nIn having their representative, Mr.\nBrown, visit our city and meet with\nour men. He then introduced Mr\nBrown who expressed his appreciation\nof the fine reception and entertainment\nthat had been accorded him during his\nvisit in our city and assured the mem\nbers that he would hereafter sound the\npraises of Mason county\'s hospitality.\nMr. Brown began his address by\nstating the purposes and functions of\nthe Chamber of Commerce. He called\nto the minds of the members the fact\nthat a good citizen was not only one\nthat exercised his duties toward his\nfamily and neighbor but rendered a\nparticular service to the community\nthat furnishes protection and conven\niences for he and his family. He then\ndemonstrated the need of an organized\neffort of the good citizens of the com\nmunity to uphold that which had been\ngained and strive for a greater de\nvelopment. Many features necessary to the op\neration of a successful Chamber of\nCommerce were discussed, such op\nprogram of work which he divided\ninto three particular departments,\nnamely, Industries, Commerce and\nCivics; Community house and its ad\nvantages to the development of com\nmercial trade; co-operative marketing\nas a connecting link between the city\nand urban man and the use of the de\npartment at Washington by the citi\nzens of the United States.\nHe dwelt quite at length upon trans\nportation as one of the important ele\nments In the growth of the nation and\nstated that in speaking of transporta\ntion he did not only refer to the rail\nand water method we so often think\nof In referring to transportation. His\nconception of one of the problems In\ntransportaton was the removal of ob\nstructions to the free flow of traffic\nand the primary problem for solution\nwas the development of our national\nhighways. In speaking of national\nhighways he stated that he did not\nmean the one that ran from coast to\ncoast but the one connecting the home\nof the country man with the city.\nForeign trade was briefly treated\nand the speaker gave the members a\nbroader conception of the part which\nAmerica will play in the development\nof its International trade area. The\nretail merchants were urged to parti\ncipate In every move inaugurated by\nthe Chamber of Commerce, such as\nDollar Days, Style Week, Trade Trips\nand Special Events, to stimulate re\ntall trade.\nIn conclusion Mr. Brown urged up\non the members to strive for a greater\nMaysville. In this connection he urged\nthat the men Inaugurate a systematic\nplan of growth for the city of Mays\nville looking ahead some 40 or 50\nyears.\nA rising vote of thanks was tendered\nMr. Brown at the conclusion of the\naddress for his kindness. In bringing\nto the emembers of the organization so\nforceful a message and extended him\nan invitation to visit Maysville should\nhe be In this city again.\nNOTICE ODD FELLOWS\nRegular weekly meeting of DeKalb\nLodge of Odd Fellows this evening at\n7:30 o\'clock.

There was\nno doorcase. Instead there was a nice\nincrease. Here 1b the explanation:\nLast year the Hillsdale school waB In\ncluded In the city total which made it\n3022. Now add the Hillsdale attend\nance of 240 to the city attendance this\nyear and you have 3186, 164 more than\nlast year. The reason for placing the\nHillsdale school with the county\nschools is that in the county organiza\ntion this school la included in the Do\nver district. We are glad to make\nthis explanation so as to show that\nSunday was the greatest Sunday\nSchool day Maysville and Mason coun\nty ever had. If we had had the time\nand had known just how to reach the\nfew remaining county schools that\ndidn\'t report I am satisfied the grand\ntotal would have been fully five thou\nsand.
