A stronger brief for the bus!\nnes policies of the president could\nscarcely be written. The article is too\nlong for reproduction here. As an in\ntroduction to his subject Mr. Price\npresents the view of the workingman\nas voiced by the superintendent of a\nlarge New England factory. We quote\nfrom this part of the article as fol\nlows :\n"I asked him how the workers were\ngoing to vote.

Cohen, Jr., at the En\nworth Methodist church on next Sun\nday night. In speaking of his theme\nto a reporter of the Daily Express, Dr.\nCohen said: "There Is a reason why\nmen have lost interest in the church;\nthere is a reason vhy men have lost\nfaith in organized Christianity, As a\nman who loves hia fellow-men, I am\ngoing into the heart of this matter\nand handle the question scientifically,\nphysiologically and searchingly. I ex\npect to publicly analyze man\'s nature,\nreveal Its Inherent elements, anjl the\nreal motives that control and prompt\nmen\'s moral actions and public con\nduct. H will not only be psychologi\ncal, but It will be thrilling, full of\nfact3 that no man can deny, and that\nno roan will attempt to refute. I will\nopenly expose the truth about man\nfrom the pre-historic days of the cave\nman, driven by primitive Instinct in\nsearch of food and pleasure, to the\nmodern man who is lashed by well\ncome and hear the truth." Continuing\nDr. Cohen said, "I expect to be square\ntherefore, I am going to invite the\nmen who come, to criticise my dis\ncourse. In fact I am going to chal\nlenge them to refute the truth of my\nstatements in writing and mail their\ncriticisms to me during the following\nweek. I will not require any man to\nsign, the letter he sends me or use his\nown stationery." I don\'t want to know\nwho my critic Is, because on the fol\nlowing Sunday night I will pick out\nthe best criticisms sent me and read\nthem publicly, and answer the same\nif they raise any questions that I do\nnot cover in my first discourse. Any\nman in Chickasha whether a member\nof any church or not is cordially invit\ned, to oome, hear the address and mail\nin his gentlemanly criticism without\nfear of being found out as he doesn\'t\nhave to sign his name to his commu\nnication to me. This is all done that\nthe public might know the truth. This\nis only the beginning of a Beries of\npopular addresses.\nv7oerving xne rormairaei,\n"Any news from that bandit today?"\n"Yes.
