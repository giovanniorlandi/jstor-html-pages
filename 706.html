L\n25 Cents per Week\nCARSON CITY, NEVADA\nTUESDAY EVEXTXG, AUGUST 12. 1913\nFive Cents per Copy Number 197\nLoan\nTHE CAPITOL\nT\nIS NEEDED\nNECESSITY DEMANS THE EN- j\nLARGEMENT OF THE j\nBUILDING\nOn next Monday the bids will be t\nopened fur the extension of the Ca;\niVil. The ilif ferent contractors have\nher ii lokking over the jl;uis and the\nbids will probably he pretty close. :\nas there is not much construction j\nwork going on in Reno t li t - sutniner. J\nThe reconstruction of the Capitol will i\nbe along the same lines as the main\nbuilding, having practically the same\nappearance a- far as finish is con\ncerned. The wing will be extended\na few feet east ami west in order to\nbreak the straight line, which as a\nwhole will add to the appearance of\nthe biir buildinir. When this work\nis finished it will add materially to j\nthe building and give it a more mas- ,\nsat- appearance.\nThe necessity for the improve\nment is shown daily. Several of the\ncommission, are scattered about town\nand rent is being paid for this out\nside office hire.. Parties coming to\ntown ask for the Railroad Commis\nsion, the State .Mining F.nginneer,\nthe Supt. of Public Instruction ami\nother Slate officers, to find that they\nare separated in different buildings\nawav from the main roof. Last win-\nI\nter proved that the accommodations j\nin the Assembly charmbcr were not j\nadequate. In fact the place was j\ncrowded and the gallery was abso- j\nlutely a farce. My the extension this j\nis done away with, better accoiumo-\ndations are offered and the Senate i\nand Assembly chambers are enlarged\nto a point where there is at least !\ncomfort to the members as well as\nto the spectators. j\nIf things go right on Labor Day\nthe breaking of the ground for the ;\nnew extensions, will take place. In\'\nsuch an event the Leisure Hour Club\nmembers will be asked to dedicate ;\nthe work and hold their ceremonies.\nAt the prison unite a lot of faced\nroek has been taken out. The rock i\nfor the building is to be furnished i\nby the prison, which matches that j\nnow in the main building. A large\nquantity of brick will be used in the\nfilling of the walls and it will keep\na crew of men hustling the next year\nto complete the plans, as it is hard- i\nly feasable to rip out the entire\nbuilding this late in the season.\nNevada has long needed the im\nprovement. During the last decade\nthe population of the state has more\nthan doubled, and from appearances\nthere will be a like increase in the\nnext few years. With the amount of\nwork now piled up and in the offices\nof the new commissions it is appar\nent to any and all that the additional\nroom is necessary. That the state\nhouse should grow with the state j\nisdiut natural. Nevada\'s capitol can\nbe made to fit the occasion ami it will\nbe within a short time. The openm\nof the bids next Monday will be\nwatched with keen interest in this\nsection, as it i expected that the\ncontractors will do some very close\niguring.\n.-o\nRAISING THE ROOF\nTlie workmen on the Leisure Hour\n("bib are rai-ing a roof on the new\nbuilding, \'which will be completed\nfor the doings of the Club during the\npiescnt fall and winter.\nHAMILTON\'S CENTENNIAL\nII win TO V rOnt.L Aumist 12\nThis city is celebrating the 100th a v i\nnivcrsary of its foundation.

The\nhouse was a mass of flowers.\nAfter the ceremony a collation w;is\nserved for the guests, which wore\nmostly relatives of the family. After\neveryone present had drunk the\nhealth of the happy couple very nu\nmerous times they departed by pri\nvate conveyance Tor Lake Tahoc\nwhere they will spend their honey\nmoon.

His advice was that the high\naltitude and rarity of the air was not\nbeneficial and she at once returned\nto her home in this city.

She\narrived here Sunday in a very enfe\nbled condition and repaired to her old\nhone which has been deserted for\nsome time and devoid of 4 the the\ncomforts or even necessities of ilfe.\nTodav a1 passing friend observed that\nthe ft out door, for several months\nclosed, was ajar. Upon entering the\nbody of the old lady wos found upon\nthe floor, her one in separable com\npanion m its cage, the canary, was\non the bed and apparently the life\nhad left the body of a good old soul\nas she entered the portal of her\n\' main possession her home, after a\nlong absence.\n; The verdict was old age.\nj Mrs. Jones was one of the pio-\ni neers of this section, having for many\ni yiars been a resident of Empire. The\npast few- years has been spent in\nlonliness in her home here or with\nrelatives in California, who have been\nnotified.\no-o\nA BUSY PLACE\nnew assay office\nThe\nofWiil\nWoodbury is one of the bifsy\npeaces\nThe assaying, with ziinc cuttings,\nkeeps the place busy all the time.\nE RESULTS\nSUCCESS IS THE REWARD FOR\nLOCAL FARMER IN\nHIS EFFORTS\nTo reclaim 220 acres in one year\nis going some, but that is what Ira\nWinters has done in a few months\non his Lake View farm. Last year\nthis was a field of sagebrush and the\nfestive jack rabbit had a fine range.\nToday it is a stand in grain and al\nfalfa and makes one of the sights of\nthe section.\nOf the tract planted 77 acres went\ninto grain and alfalfa. The stand is\none of the finest in Nevada and will\nbe cut for hay within a few days. As\nthe alfalfa has grown nearly as high\nas the wheat Mr. Winters conclud\ned that it would make better fodder\nthan grain and that he would not\nlose the alfalfa in the threshing.\nSome samples of his wheat were\nbrought in yesterday. The grain is\nover five feet high and the heads\nare even and heavily filled with\nplump wheat. The sample contained\nalfalfa, with it. showing that they\ngrew well together.\nThis work came about through the\napplication of electric power. With\nout the juice the possibilities are that\nthere would have been no such a\nscheme ami the land would be idle.\nThe appication of electric driven\npumps at the edge of Washoe Lake\ndid the business. A ten-inch cen\ntrifugal does the business. It fills a\nfourteen-inch pipe which is lifted to\nthe high lands and distributes the\nwater. It looks like a young river\nwhen the pumps are working full\nforce. In order to accomplish the\nresult wires were run from this city\nto the farm. They were taken over\nthe hills north of town and while\nit meant a lot of work it has proven\nthe results. The Appeal has for\nyears advocated the application of\npumps and electric power for such\nwork, and to see the results at the\nWinters farm is the convincing argu\nment along this modernized farming.\nBefore the machines arc placed on\nthe ground to cut, it would be a good\nplan for those doubting electrified ir\nrigation to look over what has been\naccomplieshed in the past one hun\ndred davs.\nFROM VIRGINIA\nMrs. Stock of Virginia City, is\nvisiting friends in Carson.\no-o\nFROM THE COAST\nAttorney Sam Piatt was an arrival\nfrom the Coast this morning.\no-o\nWILL CELEBRATE\nAmong the camps in Nevada to\ncelebrate Labor Day will be Ely,\nwhere preparations for a big time\nare on foot. All this goes to remind\nthe people that Carson will be doing\nsome stunts on that very day her\nself, and as it is the only town in\nwestern Nevada to cut loose, there\nshould be a tremendous crowd on\nhand.\nBE A BOOSTER ROOSTER\nBury your hammer and blow your\nhorn. Be a Booster Rooster, for\nLabor Day and every other day.\no-o\nHELD MEETING\nYesterday several mine owners of\nthe state held a meeting in this city\nand discussed various subjects. In\nthe afternoon they were the guests\nof Governor Oddie at a luncheon.\no-o\nROAD IS OPEN\nThe Geiger Grade road is again\nopen to travel.

Rodenbaugh was\namong the hardiest who came to the\nWest. lie by his efforts was one\nwho proved his theory and estab\nlished himself and family in this\nState. His honesty was a sacred\nquestion and the word of Jake Ro\ndenbaugh was a bond or better.\nProbably the feature of his life\nwas the real reclamation of lands\nand turning sagebrush flats into\nfields of verdure. This was accom\nplished when the electric power was\nnot yet introduced, yet his theory\nwas along such lines, lie proposed\nto make the river pump itself onto\nhis famishing land. His efforts were\nrewarded anil his accomplishment is\nmore than worth the passing notice\ngiven.\nSome of the pioneers did their best,\nthe struggle lasted the run of life,\nbut there was little left for the after\ngeneration.

For some time 1\nseveral of the citizens of Goldfield .\nhave contemplated asking the com- \'\nmissioners to order that unoccupied\nhouses after two years shall be torn i\ndown, but the demand for (.\'heap \'\nslraeks in Tonopah is soloying the j\nproblem of how to get rid of the j\nabandoned shanties without resort to j\nlaw. I\no - o\nDelay is Fatal\nWE once knew a man who was\ntoo tiugy to take the newspaper in\nl. t . !\nins nome town and always went over\nto borrow his neighbor\'s paper.\nOne evening he sent his son over\nto\' borrow the paper and while the\nson was on the way he ran into a\nlarge stand of bees and in a few\nminutes his face looked like a sum\nmer squash.\nHearing the agonized cries of the\nson the father ran to his assistance,\nand. in doing so. ran into a barbed\nwire fence cutting a handful of flesh\ntrom his anatomy and ruiniiiir a ?4\npair ot trouser:\nThe old cow took advantage \'of the\nhole . inthe fence, got into the corn\nnehl and killed Iiersell eating green\ncorn. Hearing the racket the stingy\nman s wile ran out of the house, up\nsetting a tour-gallon churn of cream\ninto a basket of kittens, drowning the\nwhole flock. She slippel on the cream\nand tell down stair?., breaking her\nleg and a $19 set of false teeth. The\nbaby, left alone, crawled through\nthe cream into the parlor and ruin-\ncd a $40 parlor carpet. .During the\nexcitement the daughter eloped with\nthe \'hired man, taking .the family\nsavings book with them.\nThe moral is that every man should\nbe a subscriber to his home news\npaperFranklin (X.
