        <pre>['TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 2009 79\nLeopard-men of the Congo in\nliterature and popular imagination\nVicky van Bockhaven\nVicky van Bockhaven is an affiliated\nresearcher at the Royal Museum for\nCentral Africa and collaborator of the\nEthnographic Museum of\nAntwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\nE-mail: Vicky.Van.Bockhaven@africamuseum.be\nLeopard-men of the Congo in literature and\npopular imagination\nThe Anyoto leopard-men, a society from eastern Congo, operated between approximately 1890 and 1935. Until now the history\nof the leopard-men has inspired representations of Central Africa as a barbaric and disorderly place, and the idea that a secret\nassociation of men attacked innocent people and ate their limbs remains dominant in western culture. Since the early 20th\ncentury this image has been rather faithfully perpetuated in colonial ethnography and official reports and in popular\nrepresentations of Africa. The Anyoto costumes in the collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa have in particular inspired\nleopard-men iconography in western sources until today. There are certain striking similarities between western fictional literature\non the Anyoto society and the factual sources, such as eyewitness reports from colonists and missionaries. Both share the historically\nrooted and culturally-specific representation of people from outside their own areas. In Europe there has been a long tradition\nof representing heathens and non-Europeans as being half man, half beast and behaving like animals, including eating their\nown species. Such cultural predispositions have stood in the way of understanding the real purposes of this society. Anyoto men’s\nactivities were a way of maintaining local power relations, performing indigenous justice in secret and circumventing colonial\ngovernment control. Key words: Anyoto, colonialism, representation, resistance.\nIntroduction\nLeopard-men societies existed in several parts of Africa.1 The Anyoto society operated\nin the eastern Congo where they attacked and murdered people, leaving traces, which\ngave the impression that leopards attacked their victims. “Anyoto” was the local term\nfor this society. Different authors mention that the word derives from the word “nyoto”\nwhich means “to scratch” without specifying whether the language of origin is\nSwahili or Kibali. So far no linguistic proof has been found in either language to\nconfirm this. In several European sources at the time the term “leopard men” (French:\nhommes-léopard, German: Leopardenmenschen, Dutch: luipaardmannen) was generally\nused together with the term “Anyoto” (or Anyota; Anioto, Aniota) to designate this\nsociety in the east of the Congo. Both terms are used interchangeably until today by\nwesterners and Congolese. It seems that from its origin the term “leopard men” in\nEuropean sources was meant to be descriptive and did not necessarily have more\nnegative connotations than “Anyoto.” Both terms will be used in this article.\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM79\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200980\nThe Anyoto society consisted of different chapters, which were generally controlled\nby village chiefs. In this article I generally write about the Anyoto society in\nsingular as the different chapters, which at times were rivals, seemed to be interlinked\nin a larger network. It was particularly active in the 1920s and 1930s. In the\ncolonial archives in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belgium, most of the documentation\nand reports on this society are classified under the heading Sectes et Assocations\nSubversives (Sects and Subversive Organizations). Official investigations led to the\nexecution of members but the colonial authorities never managed to come to grips\nwith this society before its stopped operations in the 1930s. The colonial authorities’\nprosecutions and these executions probably caused the Anyoto to end their activities.\nEver since the first reports on the society’s activities, leopard-men have played a\nprominent role in European and American popular literature and representations of\nAfrica. Through the images of the leopard-men, the Congo and Africa were represented\nas barbaric, uncivilized places, characterised by cannibalism and brutal murders.\nThese stereotypes have stood in the way of understanding the real purposes of this\nsociety. In recent years, particularly in Belgium, the continued use of leopard-men in\nimages of Africa has caused polemical reactions among academics and Congolese\nconcerned with the representation of Africa. The leopard-men images contribute to\nstereotypical and racist representations, with the violent aspects of past African societies\nbeing overemphasized in a similar way as contemporary war and violence in\nAfrica is overemphasized. Such stereotypes suggest that there is a historical and cultural\npredestination for war and violence in Africa.\nIn Belgium the best-known example of the representation of leopard-men is the\ncomic Tintin au Congo (Tintin in the Congo) by Hergé, first published in serialised form\nin 1931 and later adapted and renamed Tintin en Afrique (Tintin in Africa). Leopardmen\nare the adversaries of the comic’s hero Tintin. Critiques of the representation in\nthis comic are not really taken seriously by many in public opinion and are sometimes\nridiculed on public discussion fora.2\nA representation of leopard-men, which is not generally known, is the sculpture\ngroup in one of the large exhibition halls of the Royal Museum of Central Africa,\nTervuren, commissioned by the Belgium Ministry of Colonies from artist Paul Wissaert\nand acquired by the museum in 1913. The costume originally worn by the leop-\nard-man figure on the photograph is part of the ethnographic collection and was\nacquired between 1890 and 1908 by Commander Charles Delhaise of the Force Publique.\nThe original costume is now replaced by a replica. In 2003 the museum hosted\nan exhibition of the work of the Congolese painter Chéri Samba. A painting called\nMusée Royal de l’Afrique centrale. Réorganisation (Royal Museum for Central Africa.\nReorganisation), especially produced for this exhibition represented Congolese people\nremoving the sculpture group from the museum. Recently the painting was dis-\nplayed next to the sculpture. In 2003 the label documenting the sculpture group was\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM80\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 2009 81\namended to stress the significance of leopard-men societies as a reaction against colonial\noppression. In the wake of postcolonial and subaltern studies there has been a\ntendency to place the onus for the activities of such societies on colonialism and to\nshed a somewhat milder light on the violent reactions of colonized people.\nInterpretation of the sources\nWhat strikes me when reading some of the western fictional literature on Anyoto\nsocieties are the quite obvious similarities to the reports of colonists and missionaries\nwho, at different places and times, were confronted directly or indirectly with members\nor victims of the Anyoto society. These similarities can be attributed to their being\nrooted in western (American or European) narrative traditions and sharing historically\nrooted and culturally specific representations and stereotypes of others in gen-\neral, and of Africa in particular. In the course of this article I will point out particular\nsimilarities and divergences between the fictional and factual writings on the Anyoto.\nPaul Wissaert, L’homme-léopard, Commissioned by the Ministry of Colonies for the RMCA, 1913,\nSofam © A.371, collection RMCA Tervuren; photographer unknown.\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM81\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200982\nFactual sources\nFactual sources are dated mostly between the 1920s and 1950s, during which time the\nAnyoto society was much discussed in articles in colonial and missionary journals\nand ethnographic writings, in unpublished official reports and in the popular press.\nThe majority of the articles were written between 1920 and 1936.\nThe Swedish researcher Birger Lindskog (1954: 179) wrote a comparative study of\nreports on leopard-men societies throughout Africa in the 1950s, highlighting the\nlittle variation among such reports. This he attributed to the stereotyping of the understanding\nof the leopard-men societies among westerners, to the extent that it is\nhard to distinguish elements derived from eyewitness reports and those from the\nquestioning of the accused and their victims on the one hand, and elements of colonial\nimagination on the other. The authors do not always quote their sources and they\nconstantly take over aspects from each other’s stories. Furthermore, one can assume\nthat much of what is written is influenced by hearsay or oral stories circulating about\nthe society. These reports blended into a consensus, filtered through the lenses of\ntheir authors.

Some authors are per-\nsonally confronted by the society through their work and involved themselves in\nofficial investigations (see for example Absil 1934, Bouccin 1935, Libois 1936, Christen\n1937). Others who do not deal with the society directly nevertheless feel concerned\nand in their reports they make strategic suggestions about how to destroy it (see for\nexample Jadot 1928, Vindevoghel 1930, Moeller 1936). While there is a general consensus\nof ideas on the society in colonial ethnography and official reports, their authors’\nhypotheses as to the origin, organisation and purposes of the Anyoto are often contradictory.\nThis adds up to the elusive and mysterious impression that the Anyoto leaves\non western observers, a mystery that is used by some authors, especially journalists, to\ncaptivate their readers.\nFictional literature\nThe fictional sources are not intrinsically linked to the time-span during which the\nsociety existed. The leopard-men theme has started leading its own life, disconnected\nfrom its historical context, in fictional literature and contemporary popular cultural\nphenomena like toys and Internet games. In fact, there are not that many examples of\nleopard-men representations in fictional literature, but they have certainly had a\nsignificant impact on popular representations of Africa until today.\nIn this article, I will focus particularly on the novel Tarzan and the Leopard Man by\nEdgar Rice Burroughs, the author of the Tarzan series. This novel is the most important\npredecessor of leopard-men stories and popular representations worldwide. Tar-\nzan and the Leopard Men was also published in 1935 around the time that one of the\nmost important trials against Anyoto chiefs was being carried out in the Congo. The\nfact that Tarzan stories were very popular and translated into many languages must\nhave had an impact on the dissemination of the Anyoto theme in literature. In 1946\nthe film Tarzan and the Leopard Woman appeared, also based on this story.\nThis novel and others of its kind are adventure stories in which the Anyoto society\nis the evil adversary of the protagonist. In it the warrior Orando finds Tarzan, who is\nsuffering from amnesia, and his monkey N’kima in the forest and believes Tarzan to be\nhis guardian spirit. Because of a conflict in Orando’s village community, Orando and\nTarzan are confronted by the leopard-men, an evil sect worshipping a speaking leopard\nand practising cannibalism.\nIn a parallel storyline, American ivory hunter, Old Timer, meets the young girl\nKali Bwana (Jessy Jerome) looking for her brother who had gone missing in the\njungle. The girl is seized by the leopard-men and forced to serve as their high priest07\nBockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM83\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200984\ness. Later she is abducted by one of the leopard-men to become his wife. When this\nman hides her in a “Pygmy” village she risks being eaten by the local population. Old\nTimer manages to rescue her with the help of Tarzan.\nAnother novel of this kind is La Griffe du Léopard (The claw of the leopard) by\nAndré Villers published in 1950.3 This novel won the Victor Rossel prize in 1950,\nwhich is one of the bigger literary prizes in Belgium. The story is based on autobiographic\ndetails of the author, who had been a journalist working in the Congo. A\njournalist goes to the Congo to write a story about the Anyoto society. He meets a girl\nwho is looking for her missing father who has been declared dead, probably abducted\nby the Anyoto. The girl joins forces with the journalist and he has to protect her\nduring their subsequent trip.\nThe stories by Burroughs and Villers (and also the Tintin comic) remain quite\nclosely linked to the original Anyoto context as an eastern Congolese colonial society.\nMore generally, popular cultural expressions involving leopard-men do not always\nhave a direct link with Africa even though the leopard man figure, representing evil,\nremains at least vaguely associated with Africa. This is the case, for example in the\nnovel Black Alibi (1942) by Cornell Woolrich on which the film The Leopard Man (1943)\nby Jacques Tourneur was based. Even though no mention is made of Africa in this\nnovel, there is a continuous reference to the colour “black”. In this story, situated in\nNevada, USA, the leopard-man is a serial killer. He is described as “something black”\nand he is associated with the vengeance of an Indian (non-white) population for a\npast wrong. This is a similar theme to that in Burroughs’s novel.\nA comparison of the factual and fictional writings\nI will discuss the following stereotypes, namely the white male crusade against a\nsociety that represents evil, the wildness and animal-like nature of Africans and the\nnature of African religious experience. There appear to be similarities in factual and\nfictional writings on the stereotypical perceptions of Africans and their culture. However,\nthere are also some differences: the sexual lives of Africans seem to be almost\nabsent from missionary and colonist’s reports, but “the promiscuity of the African”\nfeatures prominently as a theme in the fictional literature I have investigated.\nThe white male crusade against a society that represents evil\nLike the fictional stories, the reports of colonisers and missionaries are essentially\nstories in which the author is trying to contribute to the elimination of the Anyoto\nsociety. Through investigation and ethnograpic study, colonial administrators try to\nfind out how the society works and what can be done about it. In an article in\nL’Illustration Congolaise in 1936, the District Commissioner of Stanleyville, Libois states\nthat the authorities have harmed the society greatly by enforcing a public celebration\nof the ceremonies of the mambela, a secret society restricted to men, to which the\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM84\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 2009 85\nAnyoto was linked. In this way the secrets of the society were revealed to women and\nchildren. District Commissioner Absil at Irumu writes in an administrative note in\nOctober 1934 that there are several possible ways to eliminate the Anyoto. Firstly, he\nsuggests a peaceful way by trying to settle all the local disputes, but also envisages\nmilitary repression. At times a certain frustration can be noticed in the personal reports,\nas fighting the Anyoto was not an obvious task. More generally, their own\naccomplishments are accentuated and also exaggerated. This includes accounts by\nmissionaries who describe how, before executions took place, the condemned were\ninitiated into the Christian faith and baptized in prison. As shown in the following\nquote, authors narrate in the third person to represent the category of people for\nwhom they stand. Father Joseph Christen (1936: 29–30) from the Prêtres du SacréCoeur,\nStanleyville, writes about “the missionary” – this seems to make self-glorifica-\ntion somewhat more modest and acceptable:\nMore than once appears in front of us, modest and discreet, the silhouette of the\nmissionary: […] it is most of all the image of the messenger of God who appears at\nthe right moment to bereave Satan of a prey he already considered his, for the\nremission of sins and reconciliation, to make of the leopard-men the most gentle\nand harmless lambs, of these murderers newborn people. These wolves, suddenly\nturned into lambs, have received the Missionary with the greatest joy, happy to\nenjoy the consolations of his sacred service […] After having desired and called out\nfor baptism with all their heart.4\nMuch like in the fictional stories, the missionaries and colonials represent themselves\nmore or less heroically. The more gruesome their enemy, the greater were their own\naccomplishments. In many cases, the men serving in the colony came from ordinary\nbackgrounds, and it would seem that they deliberately used their presence in the\ncolony to increase their social status back in Belgium, by portraying themselves as\ncivilizing heroes. Much like acquiring ethnographic objects as trophies, committing\none’s adventures to writing was a way of highlighting one’s colonial career.\nThe wildness and animal-like nature of Africans\nThe Anyoto society is taken to be an example of the “wildness” of the population that\nuses violence without a valid and clear cause. Cannibalism is taken to be an expression\nof this wildness. Fictional literature, in particular, stresses the irrationality and\nviciousness of the leopard society. In the Tarzan novel the agendas of the Anyoto men\ninclude petty motives of personal greed. Even though there are elements in the writings\nof missionaries and colonists pointing to a certain understanding of the power-\nrelations that the Anyoto embodied, it was never really acknowledged by anyone that\nthese were acts of political emancipation and empowerment with reference to the\ncolonial society. With regard to the motives of murder, a lot of attention focuses on\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM85\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200986\nrevenge, personal rivalries and the regaining of power without specific goals. Local\nchiefs were by definition vicious and evil and chasing their own rewards.\nIn Europe there has been a long tradition of representing “heathens” and nonEuropeans\nas liminal beings that cross the border between humanity and bestiality.\nSeveral publications have shown how deformed humans and animals serve to represent\nevil or pagans in the arts and literature of medieval European Christianity and\nfolk religion (see Gregg 1997, Mason 1990 and Salisbury 1994). The best example of this\nis the devil, which is represented with hooves and horns. In the Middle Ages Jews\nand Muslims were depicted with dogs’ heads and pigs’ noses. They were also sometimes\naccused of eating their own species, like certain animals do. In old European\nliterary sources, evil, animal-like beings are often defeated by male heroes or Christian\nelements, which bring us back to the first point, the white male crusade against\nevil. Even though these tales have lost their religious meaning, they have remained\nquite popular, for example in thriller stories.\nRacist representations of non-Europeans, non-Christians and non-white Americans\nas animal-like beings have unfortunately survived until today. Even if these\nrepresentations have changed over time and the comparison to animals may have\nbecome less obvious, people from other cultures have continuously been represented\nas less civilized (or human) in both behaviour and physical features. To demonstrate\nthe animal-like nature of such people has been a key element in the evolutionist\ndiscourse, more particularly in physical anthropology and in related colonial discourses.\nBased on certain physical features people were classified in races of which\none was one step ahead in evolution than the other. Colonial propaganda used the\nscience of the time to legitimize the colonial projects. (For a historical overview of\nphysical anthropology in Belgium, see Couttenier [2005].)\nIn negative representations or stereotyping, aspects of anti-social behaviour are\nattributed to one’s adversaries, whether this is based on reality or not. In European\ntraditions animal-like characteristics such as wildness, violence and cannibalism are\nviewed as expressions of irrationality and insanity which oppose and threaten the\nsocietal order normally maintained through mechanisms like social and self-control\nand certain taboos (e.g. on incest, bestial and extra-marital sexual relations, arbitrary\nviolence and random killing, consumption of human flesh).\nIn the fictional writings all of these anti-social aspects are ascribed to the Anyoto\nand their accomplices. They behave like animals, are promiscuous and unpredictable,\neat human flesh, smell badly, get drunk to the point of passing out and so on. In\nreality the Anyoto men were a threat to the colonial societal order and they could not\nbe controlled.\nReports that the Anyoto sometimes imitated leopard attacks, and the existence of\ntheir costumes, played on the European imagination. Reports often mention the Anyoto\nkilling innocent victims without any apparent reason. The cannibalistic aspect\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM86\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 2009 87\nalso receives a great deal of attention in the reports, even if it does not generally seem\ncorrect. Bouccin (1935: 258) mentions that limbs or organs were cut off (or cut out) and\nwere sometimes eaten. He adds that this is proven, despite the repeated denial of the\nAnyoto accused, and Bouccin does not reveal the source of his certainty. In other\nsources it is written that amputated limbs, which were not found, were eaten.\nStereotypes about African religious experience\nIn western perceptions there are two dominant interpretations of the African religious\nexperience related to the Anyoto society. Firstly, there is the idea that Africans\nworship animals, like leopards, seeing them as gods. This is clearly illustrated in the\nTarzan story where the leopard god is a speaking leopard. Linked to this is the western\ninterpretation of totemism, which is that the Anyoto members consider them-\nselves to be descendants of the animal. The occurrence of animals as mythical ancestors\nis quite common in the creation of myths, not only in Africa but in other parts of\nthe world as well. Western observers have taken this quite literally. In Central Africa\nthe leopard is a symbol of chiefly and of occult powers, which I will elaborate on\nfurther. Secondly, the idea that leopard-men are basically men who believe they become\nleopards fits in with western imaginations of African religious experience. In\nmissionary and colonist writings, Anyotism is regularly compared to the European\nnotion of the werewolf where a man, in this case unintentionally, takes the shape of a\nwolf and kills people.\nFather Joseph Christen (1936: 31) sums up both of these ideas:\nOne encounters sometimes in Africa, where the pathology is more dominant than\nelsewhere, curious cases of delirium where the patient imagines himself to have\nmetamorphosed into one of the animals feared by the population. Tribes and families\nplaced under the protection of the animal to which they imagine themselves to\nbe blood-related, live in this belief that runs in a certain way through their veins\nand arteries.5\nFinally there is the representation of the Anyoto as a sect. As mentioned earlier, most\nof the official reports on the society were classified under the heading of Sectes in the\ncolonial archives. In the Tarzan story too the society is a sect, even though it is a\ncompletely fictitious organization, which bares no similarity to the real Anyoto at all.\nThe leopard god has a hidden temple and so-called high-priestesses and priests are\nkept prisoners there.\nPromiscuity of the African in the fictional literature\nReferences to sexuality are practically completely absent in missionary and colonist’s\nreports, whereas they are prominent in the fictional literature. In reality the white\nwoman is completely absent, whereas in the fictional sources she plays a key role,\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM87\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200988\nwhere she is the object of desire for both the white protagonist and African men. The\nwhite man protects her and starts falling in love with her. The love between them is\nrepressed and the relationship is never consummated. The man has to protect her\nconstantly from the sexual greed of the African adversaries. In the Tarzan story, drunken\norgies are an essential part of ceremonies at the temple of the leopard god. Several\nof the Anyoto men make plans to abduct Kali Bwana and to take her as their wife.\nSuch sexual promiscuity is seen as an important example of animal-like behaviour\nand loss of self-control. In the history of western morality the loss of self-control has\nbeen symbolized by an imaginary beast within the human being that breaks loose. A\nbeing such as a werewolf is a metaphor for the loss of self-control as the transformation\ninto a werewolf takes place in moments of extreme emotional and sexual desire.6\nSexual repression is also a very important, if not the most important, aspect of this selfcontrol\nmaintained by the white protagonist in these stories.\nIn the following quote from Tarzan and the Leopard Men by Edgar Rice Burroughs\n(1935: 166), African promiscuity is clearly juxtaposed to the virtuousness of the white\ncouple:\nThe girl was standing very close to the white man. He could feel the warmth of her\nalmost naked body. He trembled, and when he tried to speak his voice was husky\nwith emotion. He wanted to seize her and crush her to him. He wanted to cover\nher soft, warm lips with kisses. What stayed him, he did not know. They were\nalone at the far extremity of the temple, the noises of the savage orgy in the main\nchamber of the building would have drowned any outcry that she might make; she\nwas absolutely at his mercy, yet he did not touch her.\nWhereas the sexual repression here is a reference to the maintenance of social order, it\nnevertheless retains an element of desire. The attraction between the protagonists is\nused to keep a certain tension in the story with the forbidden or restricted element of\ndesire. In a parallel way the “ungraspability” and secrecy of the society makes up part\nof its attraction both in reality and in fiction.\nHistory and meaning of the society\nWith reference to the representation of leopard-men in fictional sources I would like\nto add that more sympathetic (or even idealistic) representations of leopard-men also\nexist. In two comics in the Flemish Baekelandt series, a sympathetic stance is taken\ntowards leopard-men, even though it is in a different cultural and historical setting\nthan the Belgian Congo. The hero of the comic is the leader of a gang of robbers and\nmurderers that existed at the time of the Napoleonic wars in Europe. In the comic\nthey are a gang of social outlaws who take the side of the leopard-men and fight with\nabolitionists against slavery in Great Britain. The leopard-men in the comic are an\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM88\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 2009 89\nanachronism, as the first reports of leopard-men from West Africa date from the middle\nof the 19th century, whereas the gang of Baekelandt truly existed around 1800. The\nAnyoto from east Africa have never been represented in such a favourable way.\nThe Baekelandt comic points to certain parallels between European and African\n“gangs”. One could say that the authors of the comic perceived them as “social bandits”.\nThe concept of social banditry was introduced by the historian Eric Hobsbawm\n(1969) in the study of European social history. It has enabled historians to make distinctions\nwithin a larger category of bandits lumped together by the law. Social ban-\ndits are criminals according to the state or leading classes and, from the information\nin court records; a historian could not distinguish them from ordinary crooks. Social\nbandits are perhaps best known through romanticized stories and Hobsbawm has\ngiven these peasant heroes a place in history with Robin Hood as his most famous\nexample. In the book Banditry, Rebellion and Social Protest edited by Donald Crummey\n(1986), the social banditry concept was adapted to study similar movements against\nthe established colonial or state order in African history. Despite Africanists’ critical\nattitudes towards the essentially Eurocentric concept it has proven very useful for\nacknowledging the existence of and studying the early local anti-colonial movement.\nThese early movements generally occurred during the first decades of colonization\nbetween the1890s and the 1920s and are different in character from later anti-colonial\nindependence movements and post-independence rebellions. Early anti-colonial\nmovements started as tentative efforts to fight colonial control, but the fight was still\nunderground, not aimed directly at the colonial government, mainly because repressions\nwere feared. Contrary to later larger mass movements of a national character the\nearly colonial movements are not really taken seriously by the colonial government.\nEven if these movements had any effect on the established order, they were downplayed\nas criminal, irrational and barbaric.7\nIn the case of the Anyoto society, the dehumanization and demonization of the\nleopard-men has, until recently, precluded their recognition as an anti-colonial movement.\nThe European traditions of dehumanization or demonisation of non-Europe-\nans have been an important strategy in the legitimization of Christian or political\nimperialism, slavery and colonization, especially since the Middle Ages.\nUp to now studies of early colonial social banditry in Africa have been rather\nscarce. Even though the movements are very different, secret societies similar to the\nAnyoto existed throughout Africa and all of them indirectly opposed colonialism. In\nan article by Allen F. Roberts (1986) the lion-men of the Tabwa (on the western shore of\nTanganyika lake) are shown as an example of social banditry. The lion-men cases are\nvery similar to those of the leopard-men and Roberts makes numerous comparisons\nbetween them. Roberts does not agree with Hobsbawm, who does not consider the\nsocial bandit capable of criminal activities. Like the Anyoto society, lion-men opposed\nthe colonial and missionary intruders but, as accomplices of local chiefs, they\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM89\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200990\nalso used murder and terror in the fight for authority and power among rival leaders.\nRoberts makes it clear that Tabwa lion-men were purveyors of violence and in some\nways also heroic criminals. Their attacks could happen for very different reasons,\nsome less heroic than others. Roberts (1986: 68) writes about the criminalization of\nlion-men in historical records in words that could apply equally to the Anyoto:\nReporting in missionary diaries, travelogues or other nineteenth-century sources\nis neither consistent nor disinterested. “Disorder” is often only a matter of perspective.\nFurthermore, as both Lindskog and Joset note, cases of leopard or lion-men\nattacks had particular explanations, including revenge, vendetta, ritual or “gangsterism”.\nClose scrutiny of the Tabwa data, such as it is, suggests that all these are\npossible explanations. However, these do not obviate a general correlation between\nincidents and their historical contexts (lion-men attacks as a product of dis-\norder); rather, particular case studies allow an understanding of the process or\ndynamics of the incidents. One can suggest, then, that there is an explanation of the\ninstrumentality of lion-man murder, a kind of functionalist “bottom line” to all the\nvarious incidents.\nThe Anyoto society apparently first appeared in the eastern Congo region as a resistance\nmovement against Swahili-speaking slave trading chiefs controlling the region\nin the 1890s. It peaked in the 1920s and 30s when colonial government control was\nincreasingly establishing itself in the region. Political power-holders of the region\ncommissioned assassinations, which were carried out by the Anyoto men. Local chiefs\nmainly used terror to maintain their own power relations and to perform indigenous\njustice in secret while circumventing colonial government control. Attacks were quite\noften directed towards people working for the colonists. Furthermore the Anyoto\nwere also used for sorting out private animosities such as fights between men about\ntheir lovers and wives, or the revenge taken against a midwife in 1931 after a woman\nhad died in childbirth. Adversaries were often hit through attacks on their loved\nones, which explain why so many of the victims were the most innocent people such\nas children.\nAdministrators investigating the murders were confronted with an unwillingness\nto cooperate from the local population. Family members of victims would give\nfalse statements or even deny that the Anyoto committed the murders. It was certainly\nthe case that this terror had its effect on the population and that the stories circulating\nabout the society engendered more fear and prevented local victims from collaborating\nwith the official murder investigations. On the other hand the assassins were also\nsupported by the community, which enables us to identify them as social bandits.\nBouccin (1936) mentions for example that family members brought them food while\nthey were in prison and Joset (1954: 5–6) specifies that the interrogated leopard-men\ndid not show any sign of guilt.\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM90\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 2009 91\nObviously, the perception of the Anyoto society depends strongly on the way you\nlook at it. We must envision that colonization was a crisis for the local community,\ncreating a war-like situation, which in many cases caused pre-existing rivalries to\nescalate. Probably the chiefs pulling the strings of the Anyoto did use terror to protect\ntheir own communities as well as their personal interests. To really understand the\nsociety it is important to take a “history from below” approach and accept its complexity.\nThe Anyoto society can be seen as an example of the empowerment of the op-\npressed, and among the oppressed populations there are also power relations at play.\nClearly the secrecy and concealment contributed to the power of the Anyoto society\nand its leaders. The strength of the society must have lain at least partially in its\nmystical aspect in which the symbolism of the leopard certainly played its role. The\nmeaning of the leopard symbolism within the Anyoto society has remained unclear\ndue to a lack of available sources on this topic. More generally, the leopard was an\nimportant symbol of chiefly powers and witchcraft. In the traditional notion of chieftaincy\nthroughout the Congo, the chief was not only supposed to take care of his\ncommunity but he was also the possessor of occult powers which he could use to\nharm his enemies or those of his community. In the novel Ngando (1972) by the Congolese\nnovelist Lomami Tchibamba, leopard-men are quite literally a metaphor for the\nopposition against colonialism with the protagonist and his community turning into\nleopards and killing all their white opponents.8 The spotted skin of the leopard is\nsymbolic of the journey between the village and the forest, between the world of\npeople and the world of spirits. Leopard hides, teeth and claws were the sacred\nregalia of chiefs and these have remained so until more recent times. Mobutu Sese\nSeko used the symbolic reference to the leopard as a claim to traditional power. Particularly\namong Bali and Budu populations, in which most of the Anyoto activities\noriginated, the leopard cap and the necklace with teeth were part of chiefly dress.\nThe leopard imagery of the Anyoto must have had a strong psychological effect on\nthe local people. In fact, one could say that for the local community the Anyoto\nmurders were the occult or political powers of the chief at play.\nThe Anyoto society also had a psychological effect on the colonial establishment,\nwhich was unable to get a grip on the society despite its investigations and the strength\nwith which it was fought. The secrecy surrounding the society and its ritual approach,\nimitating attacks of a leopard, played very much on the imagination of colo-\nnizers and missionaries and engendered awe. I do believe that the characteristics\nattributed to the Anyoto society in western oral and literary sources might have influenced\nits mode of operation and even contributed to its influence on the colonial\nsociety. This becomes much clearer when we look at their costumes.\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM91\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200992\nRole of costumes\nAnyoto costumes in the collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA) lie\nat the basis of the iconography of leopard-men appearing in different kinds of western\nsources throughout time. These costumes consist of bark-cloth capes, iron claws\nwith which the leopard-men supposedly scratched their victims and wooden sticks\nwith which a leopard paw impression could be made in the soil. Except for a few rare\npieces in other European ethnographic museums, these costumes are unique in the\nworld. Reproductions of, and images based on, the Anyoto costumes of the RMCA\nhave been used in the past to illustrate literature on other similar societies. The iconography\nalso started leading its own life, disconnected from its historical context, in\nfictitious literature and contemporary popular cultural phenomena like toys, video\ngames, etc. There is no doubt that these have played an important role in making the\nstories about the Anyoto society appear more truthful. The authenticity of the costumes\nhas never until now been questioned and they have never been thoroughly\ninvestigated for traces of usage. When one takes a good look at them one wonders\nhow a man can kill swiftly and unseen while wearing such a costume? Some sources\nsuggest however, that the RMCA costumes, or at least some of them, were made especially\nto be given or sold to interested colonists. One man accused of Anyoto murders\nbecause he had claws in his possession declared that he intended to give them to a\ncolonial administrator. The fact that most of the costumes in the RMCA collection\nhave indeed been acquired this way suggests that this man could have spoken the\ntruth. Museum conservators actively urged colonial administrators to collect and ask\nthe populations for objects to add to the collection. Until now there has not been one\npiece from the collection in the RMCA that can be linked directly to a crime. Bouccin\nwrites that these kinds of objects were found in the houses of Anyoto members or\ntheir families, but that they were not usually worn for the murders because they were\nnot practical. Victims were usually killed simply with a knife. According to Bouccin’s\nmajor informant, Mbako, the leopard claws were also used to imitate a leopard attack,\nwhile most Anyoto convicts denied the use of the leopard claw forks. Bouccin (1936c:\n257) ascribes this denial to the fear of having to name the owner of the claws who\nusually was the commissioner of the murders. One of the costumes in the RMCA\ncollection was brought to Adjoint supérieur a.i. Coclet in Basoko in 1912 by a man\nfrom the village of Yapandja and according to several local informants the costume\nwas used for hunting monkeys. There is therefore, a need for detailed research on the\ncostumes to find out whether they were really worn or not. Information with reference\nto costumes suggests that the ethnographic pieces in the museum might have\nbeen made to cater for the particular taste of colonial collectors and that in a very\ndirect way they have affected the mythmaking on the part of westerners.\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM92\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 2009 93\nConcluding remarks\nRepresenting social resistance movements like the Anyoto simply as random violence\nor as a reaction against oppression denies an active role in history to those\nrepresented. At certain moments in time the Anyoto had a powerful grip on colonized\nsociety, both colonizers and colonized communities. To gain an idea of what\nthe real purposes of the Anyoto society were, western sources need to be analysed and\ndeconstructed further and sources representing the insider’s view need to be considered.\nThis article reflects a work in progress and much work remains to be done. To\nget an idea of the insider ’s point of view I will focus on both interviews with descendants\nand archival research. Accounts of members of the society and eyewitness\nreports are difficult to access, as penal files have to be 100 years old before they can be\nconsulted. This is done to protect the people concerned, such as the relatives of the\naccused. However, is this concealment really in their interests? Or does the history of\nthe Congo remain colonized in European bureaucratic institutions? In the end the\nBelgian ex-colonial government seems to have mastered the Anyoto by ensuring that\nprimary sources representing emic perspectives on the society are concealed in the\nsecrecy of its archives.\nNotes\n1 The research presented here forms part of a larger Ph.D. project on the history and representation\nof the Anyoto leopard-men from the eastern Congo; it is undertaken at the Sainsbury Research\nUnit, University of East Anglia, under the supervision of Prof. John Mack. I wish to thank the SRU\nfor the financial support and the Royal Museum for Central Africa for the research affiliation. I also\nwant to thank Lynne Marsh (SRU) and Michael Lomax (Brussels) for revising my English.\n2 On the website of the Flemish right-wing party Vlaams Belang for example, www.vlaamsbelang.org\n3 For an elaborate discussion of the leopard-man theme in Francophone colonial literature and\npopular fiction, see Halen (1993).\n4 “Plus d’une fois surgit à nos yeux, estompée et discrète, la silhouette du missionaire: […] c’est\nsurtout l’image du ministre de Dieu qui paraît au moment suprême pour arracher à Satan une\nproie qu’il croyait déjà la sienne, pour exercer le ministère du pardon et de la réconciliation, pour\nfaire de ces hommes-léopards des agneaux doux et inoffensifs, de ces assassins des régénérés, […]\nCes loups soudain transformés en agneaux ont accueilli le Missionnaire avec la plus grande joie,\nheureux de bénéficier des consolations de son saint ministère […] Après avoir désiré et appelé le\nbaptême de tous leurs voeux.” (Christen 1936: 29–30)\n5 “On rencontre parfois en Afrique, où la pathologie sévit plus que partout ailleurs, des cas curieux\nde délire ou le malade s’imagine métamorphosé en quelqu’un des animaux redoutés par la population.\nDes tribus, des familles placées sous la protection de la bête au sang de laquelle elles\ns’imaginent apparentées vivent de cette croyance qui circule en quelque sorte dans leurs veines et\nleurs artères.” (Christen 1936: 31)\n6 For a historical overview of werewolves in western popular culture and science throughout time\nsee Bourgault du Coudray (2006).\n7 Late colonial and post-colonial rebellions were better organized and often led by political or\nintellectual elites. These forces were taken seriously by the western world. In a famous book\nWeapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (1985), J. C. Scott highlights several forms\nof passive resistance such as sabotage and false compliance which are hardly noticeable from\nhistorical records. Furthermore archives usually represent the point of view of the colonial regime\nand tend to be biased.\n8 I would like to thank Susanne Gehrmann for pointing this out to me.\n07 Bockhaven 03.pmd 2/3/2009, 9:33 PM93\n', 'TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE • 46 (1) • 200994\nWorks cited\nAbsil, Comm.
