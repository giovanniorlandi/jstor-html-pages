Low strength rhyolite tuff forms steep cliffs in NE Hungary. A multi-dimensional approach including field \nanalysis and laboratory tests was conducted to understand the mechanical properties of the tuff and to measure discontinuity 10 \nsurfaces. With the help of RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) and TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning), a digital terrain \nmodel (DTM) was generated, and the results of these surveys were compared. Cross sections and joint system data were \nobtained from DTM and used as input parameters for the slope stability analyses. The rocky slope was modelled by 2D FEM \n(Finite Element Method) software and potential hazards such as planar failure, wedge failure and toppling were identified. \nThe paper demonstrates the usefulness of combined field analyses, geomechanical laboratory testing and various remote 15 \nsensing techniques (such as RPAS and TLS) in rock face stability calculations and failure mode analysis. \n1 Introduction \nHigher resolution geospatial data products have been developed at local, national, and global scale (Chen et al. 2016). \nRemotely piloted aerial systems can provide products that meet the requirements of national mapping (Cramer 2013), but \nalso support applications such as coastal and glacial monitoring (Harwin and Lucieer 2012), monitoring of vegetation 20 \ngrowth, military reconnaissance (Kostrzewa et al., 2003) and monitoring of forests (Rufino and Moccia, 2005; Scholtz et al., \n2011; Fritz et al. 2013) and of forest fires (Rufino and Moccia 2005). These systems can be used in rapid mapping in \nemergency situations (Choi et al., 2009), in vegetation and/or biodiversity control but also enable the detection of several \nspecies such as orang-utans, elephants or rhinos and provide information on density and circulation of animals (Wich and \nKoh 2012), even counting birds (Grenzdörffer 2013). RPAS applications also cover the inspections of high and medium 25 \nvoltage lines, oil and gas pipelines, roads and railways (Colomina and Molina 2014), and can be used for data capturing of \ncultural heritage and archaeological sites (Rinaudo et al. 2012, Colomina and Molina 2014, Pajeres 2015). \nIn the past years, technological development of RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) revolutionized the data gathering \nof landslide affected areas (Rau et al. 2011), recultivated mines (Haas et al. 2016) or road cuts (Mateos et al. 2016). These \ntools have been increasingly used in slope stability analyses (Niethammer et al. 2012) and in erosion process detection 30 \nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

Another remote sensing method that has changed our understanding of landslide mechanism \nprofoundly is terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) which is a useful tool in failure analysis by providing slope geometries (Fanti \net al. 2012, Assali 2014, Franconi 2014). The drawback of the latter method is that it is impossible to apply from the ground \nat hardly accessible cliff faces. Thus, it is much better to obtain a reliable Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and slope geometries \nwith a combination of these tools. The application of these techniques brought significant amount of new data on previous 5 \nlandslides (Fanti et al. 2012, Neugrig et al. 2016) and also on failure forecast (Manconi & Giordan 2015). Rock falls \nrepresent special landslide hazards since their rapid movements and various trajectories make it difficult to predict their \nhazard potential (Costa & Agliardi 2003). Several methods have been suggested to assess cliff stability from physical \nprediction rock fall hazard index (Crosta & Agliardi 2003) via Rockfall Hazard Rating System (Budetta 2004) and to \nmodelling of their trajectories (Crosta & Agliardi 2002, Abbruzzese et al. 2009, Copons et al. 2009, Samodra et al. 2016). 10 \nThese methods rely on understanding failure mechanisms and on predicting displacement of rock masses (Pappalardo et al. \n2014, Stead & Wolter 2015, Mateos et al. 2016) or at some cases individual rock blocks (Martino & Mazzanti 2014). To \ngather data on the rock fall hazard of existing cliff faces, a number of crucial data is needed: slope profiles, material \nproperties, block size (De Biagi et al. 2017) and possible discontinuity surfaces that can contribute to slope instability. Slope \nprofiles can be obtained by TLS or RPAS, while material properties have to be measured on site (e.g. UCS by Schmidt 15 \nhammer) or under laboratory conditions (Margottini et al. 2015). Detection and mapping of joints require fieldwork (on site \nmeasuring by compass), or at hardly accessible locations it is possible by applying remote sensing techniques (Fanti et al. \n2012), or both.  \nMost of rock fall hazard publications deal with hard, well cemented rocks such as limestone (Samodra et al. 2016) or various \nother types of sedimentary rocks (Michoud et al. 2012) igneous or metamorphic rocks. In contrast, very few previous studies 20 \ndeal with cliff face stability and rock fall hazard of low strength rock such as volcanic tuffs (Fanti et al. 2012, Margottini et \nal. 2015). Volcanic tuffs are very porous rocks and prone to weathering (Arikan et al. 2007). While the current paper deals \nwith a low strength pyroclastic rock, it has a slightly different approach of cliff stability analysis, since slope stability is \nassessed by using a combination of remote sensing techniques, field measurements, and laboratory testing of tuffs with 2D \nFEM (Finite Element Analysis) analyses of slopes. Compared to other case studies this study operates on a smaller scale and 25 \nstudies the possibilities of wedge and planar failures. The cliff face is unstable as it is evidenced by falling blocks. Due to \nrock fall hazard, the small touristic pathway was closed to avoid causalities. The current paper analyzes the cliff faces by \ncondition assessment and stability calculations. Thus, this research provides an assessment of how the combination of TLS \nwith RPAS can be used to create a surface model at hardly accessible sites. The paper also demonstrates the combined use of \nphotogrammetric, surveying, and engineering geological methods at difficult ground conditions in assessing rock slope 30 \nstability. \nNat.

On the top of the cliff a touristic point, the Sirok Castle is located (Fig. 1). The steep rhyolite tuff hill with an \nelevation of 298 m AMSL and found at the transition area of two mountain ranges, Mátra and Bükk Mountains. The tuff is \nvery porous and prone to weathering (Török et al. 2007). It shows similarities to the volcanic tuffs of Capadocia (Aydan et 5 \nal. 2003).  \n \n \nFig.1. Location of studied cliff faces and an image of the rocky slope at Sirok Castle, NE Hungary \n 10 \nAlthough the first castle was already constructed in the 13th century AD, due to war damages and reconstructions, the \ncurrent structure encompasses wall sections representing different construction periods. In these days, the partially ruined \nwalls have been restored, and the castle is open to tourists but southern slopes are closed due to rock fall hazard. \nThe hill represents a rhyolite tuff that was formed during the Miocene volcanism (Badenian-Lower Pannonian period). It is a \npart of the Inner Carpathian volcanic chain. The geological map of the closer area clearly reflects the dominance of 15 \npyroclastic rocks, with isolated occurrences of Triassic carbonates (Fig. 2). The cliffs are steep and display several joints and \ndiscontinuity surfaces (Fig. 3). The present study focuses on the southern hillslope of the castle hill, where major rock falls \noccurred in the near past (Fig. 4).  \n \nSirok\t\nBudapest\t\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

Since major parts of the site \nconsist of hardly accessible steep slopes that are partly covered by vegetation, traditional surveying was not possible. As a \nconsequence, remote sensing technologies were applied. The first approach was to use only terrestrial laser scanning that \nallows rapid data acquisition and generation of 3D point clouds that – during post-processing – allows creating surface 10 \nmodels. Due to slope geometries and limited access to the cliff faces, occlusions, and disadvantageous incident angles, the \ndetection of all slope geometries was not possible by using only TLS. Hence, additional terrain data was obtained by using \ntwo types of RPAS of slopes that surround the southern part of the castle (Fig. 5). \n \nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

Similarly, \nboth scanners have captured images to support identification during post-processing and to ensure providing enhanced \nquality end products (Spreafico et al. 2015). \nBecause of the steep slopes and cliffs, the scanners could acquire point clouds in a limited range, so the cloud matchings get \nhigher priority. The tie objects were surveying markers, checkerboard plates of size A4, and spheres of diameter of 15 cm. 5 \nDuring the entire time of the field work there were 38 tie points marked by spheres and 7 further tie points marked by \ncheckerboards. \nDue to georeferencing, particular tie objects had to be measured also by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The \nused GNSS receiver was a Leica CS10 with a Gs08plus antenna (GS08, 2014, CS10, 2014). The measurement was done in \nRTK mode supported by the Hungarian RTK network (RTKnet, 2013). There were 7 measured ground control points 10 \n(GCPs); the mean 3D measurement accuracy was 4.9 cm (minimal value was 2 cm, maximal value 9 cm). The raw merged \npoint cloud measured by Faro scanner contained 1.9 billion points, whilst the Z+F point cloud 0.8 billion points. After the \nresampling, these data sets were reduced to 110 million and 40 million points, respectively. Both point clouds have X, Y Z \ncoordinates, intensity and RGB color values (FaroScene, 2012, CC, 2014 Matlab, 2007, LeicaCyclone, 2016).

The system is a modified commercial DJI Phantom 2 drone (DJI, 2016), where the flying vehicle has been \nequipped with a synchronous image transfer that also forwards the current flying parameters (e.g. height, speed, tilt, power \nreserve). For safety reasons, the crew consisted of two persons: one for controlling the aircraft, the other one for 25 \ncontinuously monitoring the transferred video stream. The camera control is done by a tablet. \nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., doi:10.5194/nhess-2017-56, 2017\nManuscript under review for journal Nat. Hazards Earth Syst.

The \nimages were captured with a sensitivity of ISO 100 and sRGB color space. The lens was used with a fixed aperture of 2.8 \nand the camera was able to adjust the adequate shutter speed. Generally the exposure time was set to 1/1400 s and the images \nwere compressed at a rate of 4.5 bits/pixel. There were three imaging flights; two around noon and one about 5 in the 5 \nafternoon.

The redundancy is because of the \ndoubled terrestrial laser scanning and of the UAV survey. Since the merged point cloud is difficult to be managed due to its \nsize, and has heterogeneous point spacing, the later processing requires the elimination of the redundancy. First, each point \ncloud was resampled by CloudCompare, where the spatial resolution of the point clouds was set to 1 cm. After this 5 \nreduction, the laser scanned point clouds were merged and resampled to 1 cm spatial resolution.  \nThe laser scanned point clouds were then imported into Geomagic Studio 2013 (GeomagicStudio, 2013) and the mesh model \nwith 1 cm triangle side lengths was derived. The UAV point cloud was also imported and meshed, but the triangle side \nlength was 5-7 cm. \nTo support the geological survey, several horizontal and vertical sections (Fig. 9) were derived in Geomagic DesignX 2016 10 \n(GeomagicDesignX, 2016); these profiles were exported in CAD format (DXF). \n \nFigure 9. Vertical sections marked by parallel green lines to support geologic analyses \n \nThe next step was to make cut-offs focusing only on the cliffs; it was done by CloudCompare, followed by the TLS and 15 \nUAV points being exported in LAS-format (LAS, 2012). The exported points could then be imported into SAGA GIS 2.1.2 \n(Conrad et al. 2015), where the necessary DEMs were created by inverse distance weighting (IDW) algorithm (IDW, 2013). \nThe derived DEM-grids have 5 cm spatial resolution, which is adequate for morphologic analyses. The morphology analysis \nhas concentrated on Catchment Area (CA), Stream Power Index (SPI) and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) (Haas et al. \n2016). These indices express the potential relationship between surface geometry and geological parameters. 20 \nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

This solution has less importance in hazard evaluation but it gives the possibility to look around \nand check what is visible near the rocks. \n3.5 Engineering geological field measurements 5 \nField data collection formed the first part of engineering geological surveys. Major lithotypes were identified and described \nand geological profiles were recorded. Rock joints, discontinuity surfaces and fault systems were measured by using \ncompass and structural geological software applied in mobile phone. The structural geological data was analyzed by Dips \nsoftware. Strength parameters were assessed on site by using a Schmidt hammer. 10 rebound values were measured on each \nsurface and mean values and standard deviations were also calculated. This method has been also used previously to gather 10 \nrapid data on rock strength of cliff faces (Margottini et al. 2015). The data-set was compared to rock mechanical laboratory \ntests. \n3.6 Rock mechanical laboratory tests \nSamples for laboratory analyses were collected on site. Major rock mechanical parameters were measured under laboratory \nconditions on cylindrical specimens. These were drilled from blocks and cut into by appropriate size using cutting disc. The 15 \nsizes of tested specimen were made according to EN on air dry and on water saturated samples. The specimens were grouped \naccording to the bulk density and the propagation speed of the ultrasonic pulse wave. Strength parameters such as uniaxial \ncompressive strength, an indirect tensile strength (Brasilian), was measured according to relevant EN standards and modulus \nof elasticity was also calculated (Table 2). The generalized Hoek-Brown failure criterion (Hoek et al. 2002) was used to \ndetermine strength parameters of the rock mass. Altogether, 53 cylindrical test specimens were used for the tests. 20 \n \nTable 2.

The falling blocks can endanger the touristic \nfootpath bellow the castle. The FEM modelling was made by the RocFall software of the Rocscience. The rock slope \nstability of the investigated hillslope was analyzed according to Hudson & Harrison (1997). Since the rhyolite tuff is a weak 5 \nrock with few joints the rock mass failure and the failure along discontinuities were also analyzed. Kasmer et al. (2013) used \nFEM software for stability analysis of Cappadocian tuffs. Shakmekhi & Tannant (2015) used FEM software for probabilistic \nrock slope stability analysis considering the variability of joint geometry.  \nFirst, the rock mass failure was analyzed with RS2 FEM software on the steepest sections which was determined according \nto the TLS and UAV model. Muceku et al. (2016) show a complex slope stability analysis of a heritage town with the same 10 \nFEM software.  \nSecondly, the kinematic analysis had been done with stereographical tool. The planes of the main discontinuity sets were \nmeasured manually on site. Many parts of the hillslope cannot have been measured manually, therefore, the TLS and UAV \nmodel had been used also to determine the most hazardous part of the hillslope for block stability analyses. Nowadays TLS \nand UAV measurements are commonly used for rock slope stability analysis. Aliardi et al. (2013) used TLS measurements 15 \nfor investigation of structurally controlled instability mechanism. Tuckey & Stead (2016) investigated the determination of \nthe two critical factors of rock slope instability: the persistence of discontinuities and intact rock bridges with remote sensing \nmethods. Liu et al. (2017) used digital photogrammetry tools to determine the geometrical characteristic of discontinuities \nfor block stability analysis. During the kinematic analysis planar sliding, wedge sliding, and toppling failure were tested with \nDips software. Probabilistic kinematic analysis had been done with grid based GIS method, as in Park et al. 2015, in order to 20 \nmap the dangerous zones of the rock slopes of a road. The determination of the safety factor of the dangerous blocks was \nmade by LEM analysis with Rocscience software. \n4. Results and discussion \n4.1. Comparison of RPAS and TLS data \nThe two, basically different data collection techniques resulted in two point clouds covering the surface. These clouds were 25 \nresampled, so their spatial resolution was homogenized. These two models are suitable to compare the data collection \ntechniques (Fig. 10). \n \n \nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

The UAV data is much more homogeneous; it is because of the less \noriginal data density. Another aspect causing some differences between the two data sets is that the image based \nreconstruction is performed by interest operators, very usually SIFT (Scale-invariant Feature Transform) or similar computer 5 \nvision operators (Lowe 2004). These operators are generally sensitive to intensity jumps, points, or corners, and textural \nchanges in the input images. If the image resolution is not adequate or the object is locally “smooth”, these operators do not \nreturn with surface points and the output of the reconstruction has some “filtered” effect. This phenomenon is clearly visible \non the cliffs; the smoothing effect can excellently be seen by the Analytical Hillshading (AH) (Fig. 14). \n 10 \nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

Surface model resolution and engineering geological applicability of RPAS  \nThere are three critical sets of input data in modelling of rocky slopes: i) slope geometry, ii) strength of rock mass and iii) \njoints system. To obtain the first – the slope geometry traditional surveying techniques were used but when the cliff is hardly \naccessible, these techniques do not provide appropriate data. Thus, the application of new methods such as RPAS or TLS can \nhelp to overcome this problem. The required resolution for slope stability modelling is in the order of 10 cm, rarely 1 cm. 5 \nBoth techniques allow having such highly precise geometries. The drawback of these techniques is that data acquisition is a \nrapid process but data management and model generation take time. It has been suggested that low cost RPAS can be used in \nrockfall scenario analysis (Giordan et al. 2015). The combination of RPAS and TLS can also be used for fine scale \nmodelling of erosion (Neugirg 2016). In this study, the generation of DTM and rock slope profiles were crucial for slope \nstability analysis. It was not possible to obtain slope morphology by using any other method. For the determination of the 10 \nstrength of rock masses, we first used Schmidt hammer on site. But our field tests indicate that the application of Schmidt \nhammer in rock strength analysis is limited when it comes to the analysis of weak low strength rocks, such as volcanic tuff. \nAs a consequence, laboratory analysis of samples was required to obtain reliable strength parameters. The documentation of \njoint system and discontinuity surfaces was first made based on field data. The measurements provided reliable data on joint \norientation; however, the joint system that was found on inaccessible cliffs was not detectable. To overcome this problem, 15 \nRPAS and TSL generated images were used. The frequency of joints was observed based on these images. Similar approach \nwas used in previous studies by Assali et al. 2014, Martino & Mazzanti 2014 and Margottini et al. 2015. It is necessary to \nemphasize that with the sole use of these remote sensing techniques, it is not possible to detect precise joint orientation. \nConsequently, field measurements are considered a must in joint system analysis.  \nThis research has proved that the terrestrial laser scanning can achieve highly detailed and high precision point cloud about 20 \nthe studied surface. This point cloud is an excellent base to the elevation model, where suitable morphology analysis tools \ncan draw the geologists’ attention to the places where further examinations shall be performed. \nThe remotely piloted aircraft system is a relatively new platform in earth sciences (, but it has become clear that the captured \nimagery can be processed in a closed technology resulting in a point cloud, all of which is comparable to the TLS based one. \nThe resolution and quality of the obtained point cloud has been evaluated in the corresponding steps: digital elevation model 25 \nand morphological analyses have been executed in the same manner as it was done with TLS data. It can be stated that the \noutcome of the RPAS data capture and processing technology is similarly useful for geological applications. \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe application of terrestrial laser scanning and remotely piloted aircraft system is an excellent field data capturing technique 30 \nfor stability assessment of steep rock slopes. If the focus is on hazard evaluation, these technologies must be deployed very \nquickly, the data must be available in an easy and rapid way, and of course, the achieved information must support the \nrequired geoanalysis methods. The present study of highly dissected slope also proves that TLS is a technology where \nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

The use of RPAS technique can overcome this bottleneck: by \nthe application of UAVs equipped with camera, relevant amount and quality imagery data can be collected about steep cliff \nfaces. If no physical approach of a cliff is needed the field work is much safer; this technology can support even the \ndocumentation and evaluation of life-threatening locations. The vegetation-cover hides some part of the surface, but \nchoosing adequate data acquisition time (e.g. in canopy-free seasons), this circumstances can be managed. The collected 5 \nimages also provide a visual base to interpret the phenomena affecting the surface deformations. The remote sensing \ntechniques applied provide key data on slope geometries. Without obtaining slope geometries the FEM modelling of slope is \nimpossible. Beside slope geometries, the joint system can also be detected by TLS and RPAS. These techniques provide data \nmostly on joint spacing. Hence, the field documentation of joints is crucial in detecting joint orientation. In addition to those \ndrawbacks, at dissected and shaded areas where data gathering is not reliable, completeness problems may arise. Laboratory 10 \nanalyses of rock types are also necessary to obtain reliable geomechanical input parameters for the FEM model. Thus the \nslope stability analysis of steep rock slopes requires the use of these combined methods.  \nAcknowledgements \nThe help of B. Czinder, B. Kleb, Z. Koppányi, B. Molnár, B. Pálinkás and B.
