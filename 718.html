The Gateway to the South PRICE TWO "CENTS", ! DEBS IS GIVEN, j HIS FREEDOM, ; BY PRESIDENT, Twenty-Eight Political Pri-j, j soners Receive Execu, f tive Clemency, FIVE EX-SOI DIERS j, Commutation of Debs\' Sentence Does >, Not Restore Civil Rights of Social, ist Leader. j, i, Washington Dec. 24. ? President \', Harding today commuted the sent- ,, ence of 23 political prisoners, includ- \', ing that of Eugene V. Debs, and at j, the same time announced the pardon, of five American soldiers, serving j, life sentence for the alleged murder i, of a British army officer., As a result of reports that Debs, might be released tomorrow, Attor- j, ney General Daughertv said last, night that he would not be released j, until Christmas Day, when his com- !, mutation will become effecive offic- j, ially., Executive clemency was withheld !, in nearly 200 other cases, however, |, in>-which petitions for pardon or !, commutation are pending. Scores of j, others were convicted for violations j, of wartime enactments, but have \', never been imprisoned, owing to ap- i, peals under bond. Nearly 15.000, indictments under war legislation ,, still are pending., The action of the President in ., commuting the sentence of Debs ? ;, which was forecast in The Sun this {, morning ? created wider interest than ;, the case of any other political pris, oner of the war. He had been Social- ,, ist candidate for the presidency many j, times, and, alhough a convict at the ,, time, he was nominated by his party |, in 1920 to oppose the man who today I, gave him his freedom., President Wilson refused to grant 1, clemency in the case of Debs, al- !, though nation wide propaganda was j, organized. in his behalf then, as now. i, All that was vouchsafed at the], White House regarding the clemency; j, extended to Debs was the fact that j, both the President and the Attorney i, General had given extended consider, ation to the Debs petition, plus the, comment that the prisoner having, twice been the Presidential nominee, of 1 000,000 voters, had its influence, in reaching a decision favorable to, j his release., Soon after Mr. Harding\'s inaugu, j ration, Attorney General Daugherty, [ sent for Debs who came from prison, i in Atlanta unaccompanied and con, | ferred fo several hours with officials, I of the Department of Justice. The, convict returned to prison, also un, i accompanied, and it was widely re, 1 ported at the time that he would, soon be given his liberty., Commutation of a prison sentence, does not restore the citizenship of, the prisoner in question and Debs, may not vote or hold office until he is, given an unconditonal pardon. He, may sue for pardon at any time and, his friends insist that they will not, rest until he has regained his full, rights as a citizen., In the sketch of the Debs case, made public by the White House to, day. it was stated that "there is 110, question as to his guilt and that lie, actively and purposely obstructed the, draft." He admitted as much at his, trial, it was recalled, but sought to, justify his action., Convicted at Cleveland. Ohio, of, violating the Espionage act and sent, enced September 14, 1918, to 10 years, in the state penitentiary at Mounds, ville. W. Va., an appeal was taken, to the supreme court of the United, States, where the judgment was af, firmed March 10, 1919. and Debs be, gan his sentence April 12, 1919, in, the West Virginia Penitentiary, but, was later transferred to the United, States Penitentiary at Atlanta., The five soldiers who were par, doned outright are Carl J. Bryan, ?Times A. O\'Dell, Roy Youngblood,, George van Gilder and J. B. Rich, ardson, attached to the American, Army on the Rhine. They were con, victed of the .-murder of George, Laneefield. a fcVmer British Army, officer., POLICEMEN ELECTED, Tanny Trigger, W. H. Hunter and C., D. Morris* Chosen Today, The board of police commissioners, at a special meeting held at 10 o\'clock, this mox-ning in the office of Mayor, Duncan elected three extra policemen, to serve from today till March 31, in, clusive. Those ejected follow: Tanny, Trigger, W. H. Hunter and C. D., Morris., There were twelve new applicants,, eleven of whom put in their appear, ance. Immediately after the electior, the newly elected policemen were, called in and took the oath of office, and they will assume their duties this, evening., These policemen were provided foi, by the city council to serve during, the winter months.

A number of public spirited, I men of the city also volunteered their, \' services for this work. The other com, i mittees were refreshment, decoration, ! and entertainment., As the happy youngsters filed into, j the hall they were given red and, I green paper caps, formed into line and, I led in a march, which ended in the, [ children being seated on the floor in, ! circles, when they sang carols, were, \' told a Christmas story by Mrs. L. P., i Woodward, and were served ice, j cream and cake. The stage was bank, i ed with packages and as the children, finished their cream and cake Santa, j Claus appeared and began reading, i the names from the packages. Each, | child responded as his or her name, i was called and received a specially, \' selected present. They then filed by a, j table where a fancy basket was hand, I ed each one then a bag of candy, nuts, | and an orange, a pair of stockings, a, i nice woolen stocking cap, then a small, j souvenir, a whistle, horn or some simi, \' lar device, completely filling the bas, , ket., A huge Christmas tree was beauti, i fully trimmed, while the hall was, | festooned with garlands of red and, j green, and around the walls cornucop, j ias were hung, brimming with gay, ! colored balls., The entertainment was one of the, ibest arranged and executed ever given, ? in the city.

P. Supporters Demand, \' Appearance of Michigan, Senator on Floor, MAY BE OUSTED, i, Say Refusal to Appear .Means Loss of ?, j Seat ? Borah Clique Claims Suffi- !, cient Votes., Washington, Dec. 24. ? Unless Sen, ator Truman H. Newberry, of Michi, gan, appears on the floor of the Sen, ate and defends himself against cor- ;, ! ruption charges that grew out his j, | primary campaign, six Republican i, 1 Senators, who had been counted on to 1, I vote against ousting him from the j, j Senate, will withdraw their support :, i Notice to this effect was served to- j, | day on Administration leaders, who ,, have been defending Mr. Newberry j, and have contended that he was not |, aware of the large expenditures made !, in his behalf by his campaign com- j, ? mittee. As a result it is understood ,, that Senator Curtis, of Kansas, Re- j, ! publican whip, has agreed to see Mr. i, I Newberry ^ind advise him of the de- j, cision of his party colleagues., The six Republican Senators, whose j, final decision is believed to hinge, I largely on Mr. Newberry\'s personal I, i defense, are reported to be the follow- \', ing: Senators Frank B. Willis, Ohio; ,, Frank B. Kellog, Minnesota; Charles i, L. McNary, Oregon; Arthur Capper,, \'Kansas; Wesley L. Jones, Washing-!, ton; Hiram W. Johnson, California, j, Senator William E. Borah, Idaho, !, one of the Republican Senators who ,, has announced his intention of voting, to unseat Mr. Newberry, said today i, that there are seven other Republi- I, cans who are certain to vote as he !, will. Should Mr. Newberry maintain1, the policy of silence with reference to :, his election that he has maintained, during the months it has been under j, discussion in the Senate and the six j, additional Republicans join the Borah, group the Michigan seat would be de- j, clared vacant., Only one Democrat ? Senator Thom- \', as E. Watson, of Georgia ? plans to, vote against unseating Mr. Newberry j, If 14 Republicans joined the Demo- I, cratic minority there would be 50,, votes in favor of ousting him to 46 !, in favor of him. It may be that this I, prospect wili break Mr. Newberry\'s j, long silence., After Senator Newberry had been i, convicted in Michigan and sentenced, to two years in the Federal Prison at, Atlanta, he remained away from the, Senate Chamber until the United, States Supreme Court declared the, corrupt practices law under which he, was convicted to be unconstitutional., He then resumed his seat in the Sen- \', ate, but whenever his case has been I, under discussion in that body or in j, the committee rooms he has been \', absent., Meeting of State Highway Com, missioners, It is announced that the meeting, of the state highway commissioners, at the Chamber of Commerce at 10, o\'clock Wednesday morning- will be, a mass meeting and everybody will, be expected to come, whether a mem, ber of the Chamber of Commerce or, not., This is a question that not only, affects the business interests, but, everybody in the city will be bene, fitted and should act behind the, movement., XMAS MARKET, !

Turkeys dressed sold from 60 to 65, : cents per pound and the majority of, ; the dealers asked 65 cents. Chickens, ;, | dressed, sold from 35 to 45 cents a 1, ! pound.

President, : Harding today derided the suggestion, ? that irreconcilable differences had, ? developed between him and his dele, j gation to the Disarmament Confer, j ence over an interpretation of the, (four party treaty, pronouncing such, . differing construction as "unimpor, tant.", I At the same time he repudiated the, ! idea entertained by an increasing, i number of Senators that the Ameri, cans are "withholding information", ?from the country regarding the treaty., I He did not go into details, but it, I was taken for granted that he refer, red to the charge that Secretary, Hughes and Senator Lodge, in defin, ing the purposes and bearing of the, treaty at the recent plenary session, l of the Conference made no mention, ? of the fact that this pact extends to, the homeland of Japan, a fact which, came to light a week after the treaty, 1 was made public., Also the President let it be known, that he saw no necessity whatever for, any reservation to the treaty provid, ing against the use of the armed, forces of this country without action, on the part of Congress. He did not, discuss other proposed reservations,, but he gavo the impression that he, i would approve of none that so far, have been suggested., The President\'s views regarding the, (litre rence of iudgment as to the, Harding himself Tuesday, and by his, treaty\'s bearing, between him and his, delegation, first indicated bv Mr., views regarding the withholding of, information, were made public in a, formal statement issued bv him at, the press conference this afternoon., Regarding the suggested rescrva, tion that the treaty not em no wo r the, use of armed forces without the con, sent of Congress, the President wants, it understood that no such measure, need be taken by the Senate. He does, not agree in any sense that the Pacific J, treaty is a "military alliance* or an, alliance of any sort. It involves no, entanglements, but is merely a writ, ten engagement on the part of four, nations to confer among themselves, as to a course if differences arise or, aggressions are threatened., No comment, as already stated,, was offered today upon other nro, ! posed reservations, one ? ?f which, now projected would carry out the, President\'s own view that the four, power treaty no more extends to the, homeland of Japan than to the main, land of the United States. What the, Executive will do when called unon, to approve such a measure as this, cannot be positively indicated, but the, impression now exists that he will ask, i for the ratification of the treaty just, ! as it stands without amendments or, reservations., Also, the White House let it be, known today that the President sees, no connection whatever between the, 1 four-power treaty and the League of, j Nations. They are only associated,, ! in Mr. Harding\'s mind, as steps to, ward the same general end ? that is., ] neace in the world. The one, he be, lieves. may function in on quarter;, | the other in another., j Nor does the President believe that, j anvthinf done at this Conference in, volves the Treaty of Versailles. Cer, tainly. this Government has no sug, gestions to make for a revision of, that treaty. Any revision of it which, l may he found desirable is to be acted, 1 upon bv the nations which are parties, ; to it, the President contends, no out, j side power having any right to sug, gest modifications of that compact., ! "Under no other circumstances can, the treatv be ratified," declared Sen, ator McNary. former leader of the, mild reservationists, this afternoon,, referring to the necessity for textual, ! changes or reservations. He insisted, that sentiment is rapidly crystalliz, ing tn the effect that approval for, th" four-nower pact cannot be ob, tained without a distinct understand, ing that the Japanese homeland is not, afforded projection by the United, States. He expressed the fervent hone, that the sittincr Conference will make, the requisite change so that the Jap, anese mainland will be excluded., "If the Conference does not take, action to amend the treatv" said Sen, ator McNary, "I hone the Adminis, i tration will support a reservation to, exclude the Japanese mainland.", NO PAPER MONDAY, The Gazette wishes all of its read, ers a happy Christmas.

To write its his, tory ? every school-child knows, it by heart. So today, to write, our Christmas editorial, we shall, draw a little on our imagination,, a little on our historical lore, anc\', a great deal on the patience of, our readers., Christmas is, of course, a fes, " tival of the Christian church., But coming" down through the, ages, from the time when all our, ancestors were heathen, travers, ing the period of the Crusades, the, endless wars of Continental Eu, rope, the fratricidal quarrels of, both English and Americans ?, down to the greatest and blood, iest of all wars in our own time ?, the. ?institution of Christmas has, retained a little here, gathered a, little there ? translating, trans, forming and transfusing ? till it, lias become a composite whole of, many beautiful origins. For only, the best of each time and each, nation has " been absorbed. More, than this, the one essential fea, ture about which has been woven, a strand of a thousand hues, is, that of peace on earth and good, will toward men., Christmas has many names,, many appellations ? but one lan, guage holds them all. flic old, French Noel, from the still more, ancient Latin, Dies natalis: the, Old English and Scandinavian., Yule : and the Anglo-Saxon. Ocol., These, because the Anglo-Saxon, and the Old English- Norse are j, pronounced nearly the same, arc j, equally as familiar to our modern j, ears. The German Weihnachs- j, test, alone, has remained among l, its own people. But in Santa Clans. ?, we have the first word of Span, ish. Italian, and Latin derivation, ?, and the last word as German as 1, a bologna sausage. 1 Ioweyer. the \', good Saint\'s name is Russian, be-,, ing a contraction of Saint, Nicholas., The customs, the sports, the \', festivities, too. betray their com, posite origin. The Yule Log and*, the boar\'s head with roasted apple, in its mouth: the plum pudding:!, the pies: the cider: these all go, back to the times of Heathenesse!, |, In the historical romances of, "Walter Scott, that greatest of the, world\'s novelists, we find minute, and accurate description of the, Christmas revels in England and, Scotland. The Lord of Misrule [, in the former, and the Abbot of, Unreason in the latter country,, being officials of recognized au, thority during the festivities; the, latter, in fact, requiring an act of, parliament for its abolishment., The favorite amusements under,, these officers were gaming, music, i, chorus-singing, conjuring, dip, ping for nuts and apples, dancing,, blind-man\'s buff, many or all of, which pastimes have come down, to this day among the English, speaking peoples. Even the an, cient Celts have contributed their, share, since the mistletoe and, evergreen decorations were pecu, liarly sacred to the Druid priests, The devotional prose and poetry, that has found its inspiration in, the Christmas festival is a litera- j, ture in itself. Art and music, too. i, have been inspired by this greatest, of occasions, which has rendered, the world its willing debtor. St. ,, Leo. St. Chrysostom. St. Bernard, j, Faber. Bishop Andrew es. Dr., Mill, and Dr. Newman have fur- \', nisheci imperishable eloquence., Charles Wesley, Tat^, Byrom., Heber and Keble have written an, immortal hymnology. The Na, tivity is the subject of some of, the greatest paintings in the, world\'s art galleries. And the, masterpiece of Handel, the Mes, siah, has thrilled and still thrills, its thousands by the wondrous, music that wells from voice and, ; string and breath-blown instru, ment., This Christmas of 1921. how, ever. we believe marks a new era., i Never before in history has there, : been among all the peoples of the, j world such community of feeling, ! inspired by one sole sentiment ?, \'that of a Peace which shall never, lend.
