MNCOLN COUNTY, NIOW MEXICO, AUGUST 4, l\'Jll.\nNUMIilfiR\nThe Browns Win.\nSunday morning at \') o\'clock a\nhundred people left Carrizoxo to\nriUflomnriny tlie Carrizozo Browns\nIU Alainogonlo, with the hope\nanimating every breast that the\nIjfowus would return with victory\nlfflKi1l lltiittl 4 1i ll t it 1111 l 10 T ft \'\n(lllfn they wore not dmappoiuted, ")ot1nli for 1,1 "w,tl" 10 t,,u\n;nvuiy iHiiiuu nun wuui iiuuiucie,\nTnlarosa furnished a crew of live\nwhere nothing got away; and\nwith such a combination how\ncould the result be otherwise ?\nAnd fans ! the grand stand was\npacked full of them, aboutequal\nin number for both teams, but\nthe fans for the Browns had \'cm\nskinned when it came to effective\nfor the Browns appeared on the\nfield with a strong, active, bait\nplaying nine, and they iu,.yi?\nDrill frutn the beginning to the\nand of the irauii. For fear our\nronders may think we arc prej\nudiced in the above remark, allow\nub to give the score 8 to 0 and\nwc feel that none can question 1\nthe statement after the score is!\nnamed. j\nThe first two or three innings j\nwore excellent exhibitions of the\'\nnational game, and neither team,\nstruggle as it would, could get a\nrunner over the plate that count\ned a score. But a long drive by\nRobertso 1, Carrizozo\'s pitcher,\nStarted the ball going, and an\nother safe hit, coupled with two\nerrors on the part of the Alamos,\ngave the Browns 4 runs. The\nAlamos settled down to business\nafter that, and made it difficult\nfor the Browns to score, but by\ndint of good playing 4 more runs,\nscattered over 5 innings, were\nones, and they did the right thing\nfor Carrizozo. That Tnlarosa\nbunch was a live one, on the dead\nsquare, and the manner they\nhanded the hot stuff to Alamo\nwarmed the hearts of the loyal\nCarrizozoans.\nWe failed to get the entire line\nup of the Alamo team, but the\nfollowing is that of Carrizozo :\nRobertson, pitcher; Dingwall,\nB. catcher; Gallacher John, 1st.\nbase; Ferguson, 2nd. base Galla\ncher Will, 3rd. base; Dingwall W.\nshort stop; McLean right Held;\nVan Schoyck center field; Longh\nrey left field.\nDefeat, however, failed to\ndampen the spirits of the Alamos,\nnor did they forget the courtesies\ndue to strangers within their\ngates. In fact the boys in the\nCottonwood city are to be con\ngratulated 011 the magnificent\nmanner they entertained the visi\ntors; lor tney never allowed a\ncredited to the Browns, while the (Ulll moinent to pass. The gates\nAlamos had to content them\nselves with getting to third base\nthree times, and that was the\nnoarest thev came to scoring.\nThe batteries were Pelphrey\nand Chant for Alainogordo, and\nRobertson and B. Dingwall for\nthe Browns. Justice demands\nthat we give Pelphrey credit for\npitching a good game, and while\nsome of the boys touched him up\npretty lively at times, yet he se\ncured a number of strike-outs,\nand really pitched a good game.\nof the city were unlocked, the\nkeys were thrown away, and\nwhen the crowd streamed to the\ndepot to take a late train for\nhome, it was a tired bunch, but a\njolly one, and each and ever\nfeeling that the entertainment\nolTcred was worthy of emulation,\nthat Alamogordo was full of the\nbest people in the land and that\nthey were entitled to the blue\nribbon as funinakers.\nTwo games were arranged with\nthe Alamos, to be olaved on the\nt -l\' il l ! . . \'\niii iaci, ms pucuiug was uoi ai Uarriaosso diamond, Saturday and\nfault in the iproduction of the S , Sunday.

In\npublic life he Is tho man who sees\nthat the business of government gets\nattended to and leaves to louder states\nmen the honors of big headlines anJ\nChautauqua lectureships.

A Harvard university\nprofessor testified that tho turtlo was\nmore nearly related to tho birds than\nthe flBhcs, but tho defenso took the\nground that it was not an animal, but\na fish, and tho Judge instructed tho\nJury to bring In a verdict of not\nguilty. Whatover intellectual Boston\nmay hold as to tho status of tho rep\ntiles, there Is no good reason why tho\nlaws forbidding cruelty to animals\nshould not be broad enough to cover\nmore than warm-blooded animals.\nmm\nAND\nHAMMER IS EASILY CARRIED\nFolds Up Llko a Jack Knife and May\nBo Put In Ono\'B Pocket Head\n8lldcs Into Handle.\nAristocratic carpontors will wol-\ncomo tno folding tack hammer in\nvented by a Pennsylvania man.

Wo can no longor feol that tho\ncement Industry 1b small and unim\nportant, and that Its condition Is pure\nly a matter of privato or local Inter\nest On tho contrary, It must bo real\nlzed that tho soundness of the cement\nindustry has now becomo a matter of\ninterest not only to cement manufac\nturers, but to commorclal and flnnn\nclal interests generally. In capital\nemployed It probably ranks third only\nto iron and coal among tho American\nmineral industries. It certainly far\noutranks, in this respect, all the gold\nmining Industry of tho United States\nand Alaska. Even tho coppor indus\ntry falls Into lower plnco, for FInlay\nhas recently estimated that tho valuo\nof all tho coppor mining and Bmeltlng\nplants of tho United States Is only\n$110,000,000.

Tho waist Is\nthen rolled up wet and left nil night\nin a china bowl. In tho morning, with\nout further handling, It 1b rinsed in\nwarm water, the water being changed\nuntil tho final rinsing leaves it per\nfectly clear.

There is a variety of\noaks and some kinds have many\nnames, but tho foresters simplify tho\nmnttor by dividing thorn Into two\ngreat classes, the whlto oak group and\ntho. black oak group, which havo very\ndifferent characteristics. At the pres\nent time it is said to bo impossible to\nobtain an order for whlto onk that\ndoos not contain n number of different\nkinds, and it is not lnfroquent that\nthero is to bo found among it some\nred oak which belongs to tho black\noak class. In some markets "cabinet\nwhlto oalt" Is regarded by many as a\nmlxturo of oaks, whllo In Boino others\nit means red oak only. This varied\nnomenclature and classification has\nbeen tho causo of many delnyB and\ndisputes in the trnde, and tho ngrl\ncultural department Is at tho prcsont\ntlmo struggling with tho matter In tho\nendeavor to sccuro somo systematic\nclassification nnd understanding about\ntheso woods.\nTho average ironing board is much\ntoo largo to slip into tho sleovo of tho\naverage woman\'s shirtwaist, so an\nOhio man has dovlsed a aloovo iron\ning board. This device is mado of\ntwo boards, ono acting as a baso and\nthe other, shaped llko a sleevo, hlngod\nupon it and collapsible so that the\ntwo can bo foldod togothor when\nnecessary and form a flat ohjoct, tak\ning up little room.

A. HAIjUY,\nHlllTOIl\nWith or Without.\nThe announcement has gone\nforlli that the president will veto\nthe Flood resolution, because of a\nprovision therein giving the peo\nple of New Mexico a chance to\nvote on an easier amendment and\nthe people of Arizona a chance\nto eliminate the recall in their\nconstitution. On the other hand,\nthe prcsidctit is credited with\nsavintr that he will approve the\nNelson substitute, which provides\nfor the admission of New Mexico\nunder the constitution adopted\nby the people, and the admission\nof Arizona with the recall strick\nen out.\nWe arc not so much interested\nin Arizona, but simple justice de\nmauds that if New Mexico goes\nin on her constitution, and she\nshould, Arizona should be given\nthe same privilege. The Flood\nresolution gives the people of\nboth territories the opportunity\nto change their constitutions, but\na change is not a prerequisite to\nadmission; while the president\ninsists that Arizona\'s constitution\nmust be changed before she can\nbe admitted. The Flood resolu\ntion is much fairer than the posi\ntion taken by the president; for\nif the constitutions of either are\nto be tampered with it is up to the\npeople to do it, and if the people\ndo not desire a change no harm\nis. done and both territories come\nin as states. The president,\nnowever, insists on congress\narbitrarily changing Arizona\'s\nconstitution. The effect of such\naction is apparent it means de\nlay and quite possibly defeat. It\nis too evident that the territories\nare not wanted.\npretne court has twice handed\ndown a decision sustaining the\nlower court, the injunction will be\ndissolved and work on the county\nbuildings will recommence. On\nthe other hand, should the terri\ntorial supreme court give an ad\nverse decision to the one advanced\nby the lower court, the merry\nlight will proceed and no man\ncan forecast the ultimate result.\nTherefore, to the people of Lin\ncoln county August will be long\nremembered, and with the results,\nwhatever they arc, will follow joy\nand sorrow -joy for those who\nwin, sorrow for those who lose.\nTroublous Mexico.\nPeace, that was fondly hoped\nfor in Mexico upon the retirement\nof Diaz, appears to have been a\ndream. A number of minor en\ngagements have taken place be\ntween the Magonistas, or libcr-\nils, and the Madcristas, or the\ngovernment. Several lives have\nbeen lost and the feeling between\nthe two factions seems to be\ngrowing in intensity. Business\niffairs, too, continue to suffer\nrom such unsettled conditions\nmd the fuuire of that republic is\nnot as bright as it should be.\nWha-t the end will be no one can\nell, but if there is serious dissat\nisfaction over the coming elec\ntion, and that now seems ccr-\nain, another revolution is almost\nsure to follow.\nThe Exchange Bank, Qrrizozo, New Mexico.\nTransacts a General Banking Musiucss\nIssues Drafts on all Principal Cities of\nthe World.
