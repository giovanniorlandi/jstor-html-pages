        <pre>['Current History\nVol. 7 DECEMBER, 1944 No. 40\nThe first of two articles discussing \nthe reparations problem\nHOW  MUCH CAN THE GERMANS PAY?\nBy ADOi-F STURMTHAL\nProfessor of Economics, Bard College\nW ith  a good deal of satisfaction, \nan economist studying war-financ\xad\ning in most of the United Nations, \nis entitled to report progress com\xad\npared with the last war. Not only \nhas his professional knowledge ad\xad\nvanced, in the last 25 years, to the \npoint where the worst mistakes can \nbe recognized and avoided; the \neconomists’ teachings command \nsufficient support to impose them\xad\nselves to a large extent upon the \ngovernments. It is not yet certain \nwhether the same will hold true \nfor the problem of reparations. But \nit is a far cry from the French \nSenator Klotz’ slogan “Le boche \npaiera tout” (the Germans will \npay everything) to the present dis\xad\ncussions in England and the United \nStates. The failure of the repara\xad\ntions experiment after World War \nI has left behind it a measure of \ncaution and skepticism in evaluat\xad\ning what may be reasonably ex\xad\npected in the way of German rep\xad\narations after the end of hostilities.\nObviously, the answer to the \nquestions of how much should be \nasked for from a defeated Germany\nand how much can be expected, will \ndepend on technical economic and \non political considerations as well. \nIt may simplify matters, if we pro\xad\nceed in this order: first establish \nthe economic possibilities and then \nselect among them those that pass \nthe test of political criticism. Ad\xad\nmittedly such separation will not \nalways prove easy.\nThe man in the street in the \nUnited Nations hopes for as large a \nvolume of German cash payments \nas possible. Being a taxpayer, he \nknows that post-war levies, even if \nreduced from their high war-levels, \nwill continue for a long time at \nrates far above those of the pre-war \nera. Substantial contributions from \nthe defeated nations to the treasury \nof his own country will, he hopes, \nhelp reduce his tax burden. Little \ndoes he realize, however, the tre\xad\nmendous implications of large \ninternational cash-payments, al\xad\nthough the memory of the disap\xad\npointment after the last war may \ntend to disturb his comfortable \ndreams. Large unilateral cash-pay\xad\nments from one country to another\n', '44$ CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1944\nactually involve • two processes, as \nthe Young Plan recognized: one \nconsists of raising the necessary \namount in the paying country and \nin its own currency; the other, far \nmore troublesome, is the transfer \nof the payment to the recipient, the \nexchange of one currency into an\xad\nother. The first is achieved when \nthe German (or Japanese) budget \nshows a surplus equal in size to \nthe payment. This can be obtained \nby raising German taxes and reduc\xad\ning governmental expenditures to \nthe required extent. There are lim\xad\nits to both actions, difficult to point \nout precisely, but existing never\xad\ntheless. Excessive tax rates may \ndefeat their own ends and, by re\xad\nducing German national income be\xad\nlow a certain level, make it impos\xad\nsible to obtain the hoped-for tax \nyield. Cutting governmental expen\xad\nditures below certain levels might \nharm production and thus again \nreduce the taxable income below the \npoint where the desired tax-yield \nwould be forthcoming. Within these \nlimits, raising reparations should \nnot present insuperable difficulties, \nparticularly if at the same time \nGerman armaments expenditures \nare reduced or altogether elimi\xad\nnated.\nPROBLEMS OF CASH PAYMENTS\nIt is the process of transfer to \nthe recipient which presents the \ngreatest obstacles. In order to \nachieve the transfer, the paying \ncountry must obtain an export sur\xad\nplus equivalent not only to its reg\xad\nular needs (raw materials, food \nstuffs, etc.) but also to the volume \nof the payment. In other words, \nlarge ufiilateral international pay\xad\nments can be made only in the \nform of exports. Economic theory \ntends to show that the conditions \nfor an export surplus are created by \nthe act of payment itself. Unfortu\xad\nnately, this statement requires so \nmany qualifications that it is unlike\xad\nly to hold true in some of the sit\xad\nuations which we shall have to face \nafter the war.\nAccording to theory, prices are \nlowered in the paying country by \nthe elimination of purchasing \npower through the process of taxa\xad\ntion. The receiving country, by \nspending the payment obtained, in\xad\ncreases effective demand, thus rais\xad\ning prices. The price differences \nthus created will make it possible \nto sell the necessary volume of ex\xad\nports in the receiving country.\nIt is true that the process of \nraising reparations would lower \nprices in the paying country. But it \nis not necessarily so that the price \nreduction will be universal, par\xad\nticularly if monopolistic combina\xad\ntions are permitted to survive in \npost-war Germany. It is quite pos\xad\nsible that the goods whose prices \nare reduced most strongly in Ger\xad\nmany would not be exactly those \nwhich the recipients of German rep\xad\narations would be most eager to re\xad\nceive. For such commodities price \nreduction would have to be driven \nto the extreme, before the necessary \nvolume of exports could be \nachieved. In the long run, German \nproduction could, of course, be re\xad\nadjusted to market conditions, so \nthat Germany would produce for \nexport purposes those goods upon \nwhich the Allies are most eager to \nspend the payments received (or \nthe purchasing power set free in the\n', 'HOW MUCH CAN THE GERMANS PAY? 449\nUnited Nations by tax reductions). \nIn the meantime, however, Allied \nproducers would be confronted by \nunexpected German sales under\xad\ncutting them in their established \nmarkets and depriving them of \ntheir “normal” sales. Adjustments \nwould then have to be made in the \nAllied countries as well. Resources \nset free, as a consequence of German \nimports, might be used for different \npurposes, but in a system of pri\xad\nvate enterprise such changes mean \nheavy losses and bankruptcy to \nthose compelled to change from one \nline of business to another. The re\xad\nceipt of reparations, at least in its \ninitial stages, would thus not cause \nuniversal joy in the Allied nations. \nProducers threatened by what they \nwould probably call German cut\xad\nthroat competition would fight bit\xad\nterly against the taxpayers within \neach nation.\nStill, this question might be \nsolved more easily than that of \nraising price levels in the receiving \ncountries. For the assumption that \nthe recipients would spend the pay\xad\nments received is not likely to \nprove correct in many cases and \nwithout such spending the price \nincrease, necessary for successful \nGerman exports would fail to ma\xad\nterialize. As Professor Hans Neis- \nser has shown in a study prepared \nfor the American Labor Confer\xad\nence on International Affairs, sub\xad\nstantial parts of the reparation pay\xad\nments—or of the purchasing power \nmade available to taxpayers by tax \nreductions—will probably not be \nspent, particularly in wealthy na\xad\ntions, but added to the large volume \nof savings for which it may prove \ndifficult to find investment outlets.\nREPARATIONS AND THE \nUNITED STATES\nThe United States is most likely \nto be confronted by this problem. \nIts national income at anything \nlike reasonably full employment is \nso high that the problem of using \nits savings will strain the resource\xad\nfulness of American leadership to \nthe limit. Any increase in savings \nas a result of substantial reparation \npayments would merely tend to \nmake American economic problems \nmore complicated without adding \nto the national income in any ap\xad\npreciable measure, if at all. Special \nmeasures to funnel reparation pay\xad\nments straight through to the low\xad\nest income groups, most likely to \nspend them, might seem to help. \nBut inevitably this would also in\xad\ncrease profits of high-income \ngroups and thus expand the volume \nof savings. A considerable increase \nin the demand for commodities \ncould thus hardly be expected and \nattempts’to transfer German pay\xad\nments would thus be apt to prove \nabortive.\nIt might still be possible for \nGermany to obtain gold or foreign \nexchange for transfer to the United \nStates by exports to third nations, \nwith a higher propensity to con\xad\nsume. In this way the United \nStates could continue to increase \nits gold reserves at the price of up\xad\nsetting monetary systems in the \nrest of the world, without any real \nbenefit to this country. Or, finally, \nAmerica might re-invest in Ger\xad\nmany what Germany owes in cur\xad\nrent reparation payments. This \nwould transform a “political” into \na commercial debt, repeating much \nof the experience after the last war,\n', '450 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1944\nwithout changing anything in the \nnature of the problem.\nWhile the United States thus can \nhope for little in the way of rep\xad\narations, poorer countries which \nwould spend a large part of the \nsums received, might fare better. \nPoland and Czechoslovakia, Bel\xad\ngium and Yugoslavia would be bet\xad\nter able to receive payments than \nthis country and Great Britain— \nwhich, after all, makes justice co\xad\nincide with economic law. The So\xad\nviet Union is in a place by itself. \nNot only does its standard of living \nmake it appear probable that rep\xad\narations would be rapidly spent, \nrather than added to a large volume \nof abortive savings, the system of \ngovernmental control would permit \nlarge imports to be integrated into \nthe economic plan in such a way as \nto create a minimum of disturb\xad\nances in domestic economic pro\xad\ncesses. Moreover, no differences in \nprice levels would be needed to \nmake government-sponsored im\xad\nports profitable (as in countries of \nprivate enterprise).\nGerman cash payments of a re\xad\ncurrent nature are thus possible \nto the extent to which regularly \nrecurrent German export surpluses \ncan be created and German goods \nare accepted by the rest of the \nworld. Countries eager to obtain \nsuch payments would have to re\xad\nsign themselves to a passive bal\xad\nance of trade with Germany, and \nBelgians, Czechs and Yugoslavs \nwould have to consume German \ngoods, in spite of their dislike of \nthings German which is apt to \nlinger long after the end of Nazi \noppression. It would also be neces\xad\nsary to allow or even encourage a\nrapid German industrial recovery, \nsince without it no German pay\xad\nments could be expected. Needless \nto say, a Germany deprived of her \nindustrial resources could hardly \nbe expected to make substantial re\xad\ncurrent cash-payments.\nREPARATIONS IN KIND\nWhat about alternative ways of \nobtaining reparations? Most of \nthese proposals would come under \nthe heading of "reparations in \nkind.” The simplest and most ob\xad\nvious of these aims at the restitu\xad\ntion of property taken over by \nNazis or Nazi-supporters in occu\xad\npied areas. For the lawyer such \nrestitution may present innumer\xad\nable difficulties, but the economist \nwill agree that the straight transfer \nof titles to property or the physical \nremoval of stolen property from \nGerman soil to the place where it \nwas located prior to Nazi confisca\xad\ntion, can be done in most cases \nwithout insuperable economic dif\xad\nficulties. Even where such difficul\xad\nties may exist, the moral compul\xad\nsion to carry out this simple act \nof justice will take precedence over \neconomic considerations.\nCan Germany be compelled to \ntake over the reconstruction of \ndevastated areas? This supposedly \nmeans that the German government \nwould be asked to turn over to the \nAllies equipment, machinery, hous\xad\ning materials, railroad stock and so \nforth to replace similar material \ndestroyed on United Nations’ terri\xad\ntory during the war. Economically, \nthis may seem a simple procedure; \nit was considered after World War \nI, but rejected as a method of ef\xad\nfecting the bulk of German pay\xad\nments. The main problem is one of\n', 'HOW MUCH CAN THE GERMANS PAY? 451\ntiming. Most probably German in\xad\ndustry, immediately after the end \nof hostilities, will be in a state of \nutter collapse. It will take some \ntime, probably several years, be\xad\nfore German industrial reconstruc\xad\ntion will have progressed to the \npoint where substantial transfers of \ndesignated products on a current \nbasis will become possible. It is \nunlikely, however, that the Allies \nwill postpone rebuilding their dev\xad\nastated areas until substantial and \nrecurrent German contributions in \nkind will be available. The bulk of \nFrench reconstruction was com\xad\npleted, after World War I, before \nlarge-scale German deliveries of \nfinished products became technical\xad\nly possible.\nOf course available German \nstocks could form a reservoir from \nwhich the Allies could draw sup\xad\nplies. The main problem, in this \nconnection, would be not so much \nthe Germans, but rather other na\xad\ntions waiting to sell their own raw \nmaterials to the victorious Allies. \nAfter the last war, England was \nnone too happy about German coal \ndeliveries to France which deprived \nBritish coal mining of a market, \nonce the first hunger for coal was \nstilled. Nevertheless, it is reason\xad\nable to expect that in view of the \nhuge reconstruction needs of the \nEuropean continent, German deliv\xad\neries in kind will be made use of, \nprovided there will be stocks of \nmaterials left in Germany. If one \nwere to draw a balance sheet of \nGerman reparations after the last \nwar, offsetting German cash-pay\xad\nments against German borrowings \nabroad, deliveries in kind—next to \nthe transfer of German capitalitems\nsuch as the merchant marine \nand state-property—would form \nthe largest single item.\nBLOCKED MARK ACCOUNTS\nIn his study mentioned above, \nHans Neisser examines the sug\xad\ngestion of making reparations avail\xad\nable in the form of blocked mark \naccounts. The Allies would receive \nsuch accounts and could use them \nto buy needed goods in third coun\xad\ntries which, having been paid in \nmarks, would spend them for the \npurchase of German goods. In this \nway the Allies could obtain as rep\xad\narations materials which Germany \ndoes not produce while the seller \nwould be paid by Germany. The \nmain danger in such a procedure is \nthat the “third nations” might use \nthe mark for the purchase of com\xad\nmodities which they would have \nbought in any case, rather than for \nadditional purchases. If this were \nto be the case, German exports on \nreparations account would be sub\xad\nstituted for, rather than added to \nnormal exports, with the result \nthat normal trade would suffer. \nClose supervision of the use to \nwhich blocked mark accounts are \nput, would thus be necessary.\nLABOR REPARATIONS\nThe last major proposal, made \nparticularly in the Soviet Union, \nforesees the use of German man\xad\npower for reconstruction work \nabroad. Kurt Eisner, leader of the \nBavarian Republic after World \nWar I, was one of the first to \nmake a similar proposal. He meant, \nof course, that German workmen \nshould be hired to do the job. \nWhether the present plans are \nintended to organize forced labor\n', "452 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1944\ngroups—perhaps after the pattern \nof military conscription—or wheth\xad\ner voluntary labor-contracts are to \nbe used, has not been made fully \nclear. Labor efficiency in the latter \ncase is likely to be higher than that \nof forced labor. Moreover, it is \nlikely that trade-unions, the world \nover, would protest against the use \nof forced labor. Already American \nFederation of Labor organizations \nhave expressed themselves strongly \nagainst the use of force in the or\xad\nganization of German manpower \nfor reparations. From the point of \nview of the receiving country a vol\xad\nuntary organization would be dis\xad\ntinctly preferable, and general poli\xad\ntical considerations strongly argue \nin its favor.\nIf the voluntary system were to \nbe adopted, the assumption seems \nto be that the country of origin \nwould assume charge of support\xad\ning the workers while they ' are \nabroad. This would have to be \ntaken into account in determining \nother German payments since Ger\xad\nmany’s material output would be \nreduced, not only by the absence \nof a number of workers, but also by \nthe supplies necessary to support \nthem. Germany would have to offer \nthe workers attractive working con\xad\nditions so as to obtain a sufficient \nnumber of volunteers. Trouble \nmight result, however, if the Ger\xad\nman worker abroad should enjoy \nbetter working conditions than his \nnative colleague. Methods to obvi\xad\nate such a situation should not be \ndifficult to devise (e.g. by compul\xad\nsory savings).\nCONCLUSIONS\nA fair summary of what pre\xad\ncedes might lead to the following \nconclusions:\n1. Recurrent German cash pay\xad\nments require not only recurrent \nGerman export surpluses, but also \nhigh propensities to consume on the \npart of the recipients. In their first \nstages, such payments might also \ninvolve difficult and prolonged ad\xad\njustments, both on the part of the \npaying and of the receiving coun- \ntry.\n2. German participation in the \nphysical reconstruction of devas\xad\ntated territories by deliveries of \nspecified finished products is not \nlikely to be practicable on a large \nscale in view of the desire of the \nnations concerned to complete re\xad\nconstruction as rapidly as possible.\n3. Deliveries in kind, a limited \nand supervised use of “blocked \nmark” accounts and the employ\xad\nment of voluntary labor forces seem \nto represent the best methods for \nreparations.\nThis is, I believe, as far as the \neconomist may go at this stage, in \nformulating conclusions. To name \nfigures would be impossible and \nmeaningless, as long as so many \ndecisive factors are unknown— \nsuch as the state of German indus\xad\ntry after the end of hostilities, ter\xad\nritorial arrangements and so on. \nIn a subsequent article I shall dis\xad\ncuss a number of political consid\xad\nerations which may more exactly \ndetermine to what extent and in \nwhich way the various methods \ndiscussed may be used.\nP resident R oosevelt’s foreign trips totaled 306,265 miles by mid-August of \nthis year.\n"]</pre>
