Honey, the\nfamous graft prosecutor of tho Pacific\nCoast, in New York City has led to a\nnumber of rumors concerning his\nmotive. Mr. Heney says that he has left\nthe Pacific slope for good and that he\nFRANCIS J. IIKNEY\nwill build up i law practice iu that\ncity and live there in the future. He\nbaa nothin# to say about the report*\nthat Governor Hughes will appoint\nhim special investigator of the legiala\nlive oorruptiou in the Empire State.\nHeney’s reputation is so well known\nthere that his arrival was immediately\nheralded in a rain of reports, chief ol\nwhich was.that Governor Hughes would\nrelinquish into Honey\'s hands the fight\nagainst corruption in New York State\nwhen he—the Governor—takes up bi»\nposition on the Supreme Court bench\nIt has been known for some time that\nGovernor Hughes is auxious to havr\nseveral corrupt trails which cropped\nout in the AildsCongcr investigation\nfollowed, bat had no one to whom be\ncould delegate the trust.\nElko Constable Must\nfa; $500 Damages\nAn interesting suit for false imprison\nment came to an end In the District\nCourt Monday night when the jury in\nthe case of Charles Doherty against\nConstable Ouderkirk brought in a ver\ndict of |50>l and costs, says the Elkr.\nIndependent. Tbe particnlars of tbe\ncase as told to ns by Mr. Doherty are as\nfollows:\nOn the night of the 231 of Jnly, 1908.\nhe was in town and whs in ills bed at\nHolland\'s livery stable when Depnty\nConstable Ootant came in to arrest a\ntrsmp sleeping in the bay. The tramp\nwas both drunk and sleepy and did not\nwake np at the moment. Mr. D iherty,\nwho waa lying near him, said, “You\'d\nbatter go, as be killed a man last week,"\nrelering to an unfortunate incident in\nOfficer Cotant\'s life. This made the\nofficer very angry and he proceeded t<\nabase Mr. Doherty and left the stable.\nHe returned a short time latter with\nMr. Clinton aud arrested Doherty and\nlooked him np in the old jail. The cell\nwas very filthy aud Mr. Doherty spent\na very onphasant night. The next day\nhe was released aud brought snit for\nH000 damages for false imprisonment\nagaiust Constable Ooderktrk. The cast\nwas tried by a jury Monday and Mr.\nDoherty was given a verdict for |60t\nand ousts.\nLand Crevasses At Dli\npah Still Causing Trouble\nEly Expositor Msy 14: Sixteen dead\nhorses were taken from the water-filled\ncrevasses of Jake’s Valley yesterday. In\naddition four coyotes were found dead\non the banks of the widest bole. Cattle\nare beginning to come iuto the valleys\nagain and the ranchers in the vicinity\nof Iliipah are taking additional precau\ntions to prevent fnrther loss of their\nherds. This was the information brought\nto Ely last night by C. F. Patterson,\ndeputy United Status forest supervisor\nunder Koyal Mathias. “The orevasses\nare gettiug wider. If anything,” said\nMr. Patterson, “and despite the faot\nthat the surronnding country is drying\nup they are as full of water now as at\nthe start, ntock is begiuuing to oorne\ninto the valley again and the ranchers\nare beooming alarmed over the safety ol\ntheir herds. Mo one seems to know the\nt»W of this strange phenomenon."\nFAMOUS HARDIN RMESSOLO\nUtah Capitalists Project Large\nColonization of Settlers In\nHumboldt County\nThe Og.len Standard pnblUhe* the\nfollowing in regard to the project for\n•he colonization of the H.rdin ranches\nin the northern part of Humboldt\nConnty in the great Qninn Hirer Valley:\n“Ogden capital i* going into reclama\ntion projects in Nerada, with bright\nprospects of developing the desert re\ngion and mnliing it blossom as the rose.\nThe latest cattle ranch to be aeqoired\nby local rarestors is that of the Hardin\nproperty and a great stretch of oonntry.\n45 miles, to the northwest of Winne\nmocoa, Nerada, will be the scene of\nan irrigation scheme which will re\nclaim 50,000 acres of rich sagebrush\nland, the fertility of which is unqnes\ncloned.\n“The purchasers are Dr. H. M. Howe,\nGeorge Matson, E. W. Matson, Hugh\nDyer, Dr Edward Rich. Jesse Knight\n»nd E P. Edison. They hare acquired\n27,000 acres of hay laud along the\ntiuinu rirer and its tributaries and\nreserroir sites capable of storing water\nfor more than 50,000 acres of land to be\nreclaimed.\n“The range is to b* stocked with 5000\nto 10,000 cattle and 20,000 to 26,000\nsheep. Yesterday 1400 bead of stock\ncattle were purchased to be shipped to\nthe ranch.\n"Our Utah men know the value of\ntheae Nevada cattle ranches end are\neagerly reaching out for properties like\nthe one jnst purchased. The old Ne\nvada cattlemen ranged their herds in\nthe mouutaius and cot a few tons of\nhay from ttie bottom lands for Winter\nfeeding, but they gave no thought to\nfarming; in fact, they discouraged\nthe settling np of the country by small\nfarmers. The Utah men will reverse\nthis policy and whenever practical will\ndivide the large tracts into sma,l hold\ning" and invite the bomeseeker to ac\nquire holdings. They will redeem (he\n•agebrush areas within the reach of\ncanals aud, generally, bless the country\nwith their presence.\n“Jesse Knight sod Hash Dyer are\ni’eet sugar men. Mr. Knight has »\nfactory in Alberta, Canada, and Mr\nDyer is one of the Dyer Brothers, man\nufacturers of beet sagar machinery\nuid first Superintendent of the Ogden\n■sugar Factory. They have in vie*\nthe building of a sugar factory on\nteuton River and the developing of the\nbeet sugar indnstry on the large acreage\nof sagebrush land to be redeemed\nWith the sugar factory will come rail\nroad* and a wonderful transformation\nof the northern part of llnmboldi\nCounty, Nevada. A few days ago the\n-standard said a railroad was projected\nfor Winnemncca to Klamath Falls,\nOregon. Assurances have been given\nthat the new road will cot throngli\nthis empire of new towns to he built\nand new industries to be established.\n"Oar farmers should keep in toocb\nwith this uew era in Nevada. It is\nfar mors Inviting and snbstantial than\nwas tiie glitter of Goldfield gold which\na few years back held the attention ol\nour people aDd finally left such ar\naching void."\nImportant Decision\nOn Mining Stocks\nOne of the molt important deoiaione\nin thie State for tome time waa handei\ndown recently by Judge M.

Mark at one\ntime lived at Aurora aud also tad a\ncabin there, but there has not been\nenough of the aforesaid cabin there for ]\nyear, to build a Are to oook breakfast\nfor a jaybird. The late Hank Blanchard\nfor years used to present every tender\nfoot coming into this section with a\npiece of wood from that cabin-all ol\nwhich came from a fence that once\nadorned the road near Sunshine.-Bodls\nUlnar.\nACQUIRES REPUTATION\nAS A PUBLIC SPEAKER\nThe DocheM of Marlborough, former\nly Oonauelo Vanderbilt, ia attaining\nquite a reputation aa a public ipeaker.\nTHE DUQHKSS OP M AliLIiOBOCGH.\nShe has addressed many gatherings of\ncharitable organizations and at a recent\nmeeting of the Society of American\nWomen in Louden, sin spoke in favor\nof woman snfTrare and commended the\ncourage of the snfTragettes.

At the natural rate of in\norease, Ireland should have to-day, in\nstead of 4,350,000 inhabitants, at least\nthree times that number.\nWith 33,000 square miles of land, the\ngreater portion of it exceptionally fa\nvorable for the raising of grains, roots,\nfruits and rattle; with magnificent\nwater power—a water power equaled\nby few countries—and with its well\nIcoown, if undeveloped, great mineral\nresources Ireland is oapable of support\ning in comfort and plenty 30,000,000\npeople.\nEmigration has been a blessing as\nwell as a curse to Ireland. While for\n80 or 70 years it has gone on depriving\nIreland of all that was healthiest and\nbrainest and beet in the oonntry, thus\nenervating the raoe at home, the Irish\nNation is not at the same time unmind\nful of the fact that the millions of\nAmerican money poured home to Ire\nlaud iu steady stream has helped,\nthrough the trying decades that have\ngone by, to keep alive an Ireland-at\nhome. In at least 20 of the 82 counties\nof Ireland it is rare to find a family\nthat has not a representative in Ameri\nca. Some of them have four or five.\nIn all the poorer mountainous counties\nthat border on the rugged western coast\nthere is hardly a oomfortable new\nhouse ereoted that baa not been erected\nby American money.\nInvestigating Nevada Mineral Lands\nE. B. Laoey and Edward Doyle, spe\ncial agents of the United States Land\nDepartment, are in \\ lrginia uity con\nduoting an investigation of the com\nplaints that the Southern Pacific Com\npany is eudeavoriug to hold mineral\nland on the Comstock under patents\nissued for nou-mineral land. The rail\nroad company secured patents to large\nportions of land in Storey Coonty, as\nit did in other counties in the State, on\na showing that the land was non-min\neral and it u now claimed by those con\ntesting the right of the railroad to this\nland that it wu known to contain min\neral at the time the patents were issued.\nButMcrlbe (or tha Sistis el.\nw. P. FORCES LOWER RATES\nAdvent of New Railway Into Ne\nvada and California Is Already\nProving Beneficial\nSacramento Bee: One of the first re\nmits of the advent of the Western Pa\nciflo Company Into California and\nNevada, and which is to the benefit\nof Sacramento merchants, weut into\neffect on the first of this month. It i*\nthe geueral redaction of rates into the\nNevada territory tributary to the line\nof tire Nevada, California and Oregon\nRailway, a narrow gauge road from\nReno, Nevada, to Alturas, Cal., serving\nme riel. Surprise Valiev couutrv. *n3\nalso the Lakeriew territory in southern\nOregon.\nHeretofore, the rates have been so\nhigh that they were practically pro\nhibitive, haviug the effect of retarding\nthe growth of trade with that section\nand preventing Sacramento shippers\nfrom competing. The ratss are now\nreduced on an average of 50 percent,\nand in some instances the rates have\nbeen cut to a greater extent.\nSacrameuto was obliged, nutil the\nfirst of this month, to pay a rate of\n$2 20 per 100 pounds on all merchandise\nto Alturas, regardless whether the\nshipments were dry goods or nails.\nThe new tariffs, forced by the West\nern Pacific places the freight rates on a\nclass basis, vz.\\ »ov on first class\nfreight, dry goods, etc th« rate is\n$1.63, a reduction of 57 cents on the 100\npounds. The rates ou third and fourth\nclass freight, such as are shipped by\ngrocers and hardware dealers, are $1.33\nand $1.17, where, as has been stated,\nit was formerly $2.20 on 100 pounds.\nThe N.-O.-O. road connects with\nthe Southern Pacific at Reno, and all\nfreight heretofore was shipped from\nSacramento to points on the N.-C.-O.\nby way of Reno.\nNow the Western Pacific line croeses\nthe N.-O.-O. at Doyle and traverse,\na large section of the Surprise Valley,\nwhich is easily reached by teams from\nthe Western Pacific. Thus, the Wes\ntern Pacific forced down the rates and\nat the same time’ forced the N.-O.-O.\nto interchange freight. Another effect\nthe Western Pacific lias had is to re\nduce the high rates on the N.-O.-O.\nfrom Reno to all poiuts on the line.\nMap* of Eureka Mining District\nThe Sentinel has received a limited\nnumber of new black and white prints\nof Enreka mining district.

R. Alberger, traffic\nmanager of the Tonopah and Tidewater\nRailroad, recently talked very enter\ntainingly with one of the editors of the\nCalifornia News Service upon the busi\nness conditions in Nevada. Mr. Al\noerger said that one of the very en\ncouraging items of news is that jnst\ngiven oat by the State Bnlliou Tax\nAgent showing that the prodnotion of\nminerals in Nevada gained in value\nabout 110,000,000 in 1909 over theflgores\nof 1908, an lucrease of 40 per oent in one\ntie pointed ont th® tromendona\ncopper deposits of Ely. believed by\nmany competent mining men to be as\ngreat as those of Butte, Montana; the\nsteady and generons prodnotion of the\nsilver mines of Tonopah and the gold\nmines of (ioldfield and vicinity, together\nwith the rejnrenation of the great mines\nof the Comstock Lode, which is being\nundertaken by a wealthy syndicate of\nNew York bankers, headed by the\nLewlsohns—all promising still greater\nmineral outpnt for Nevada in the com\ning years. Added to this is the con\nstantly increasing acreage of the State\nthat is being brought nnder cultivation\nin several of the great valleys of Ne\nvada, an increase that will receive tre\nmendous impetns ou the completion of\nthe mammoth Tracke9 irrigation enter\nprise now being carried to completion\nby ll;; TT-\'ited States Government.\nMr. Alberger\' very aptfy remarked\nthat Nevada is not making qnite as\nmuch noise as it did a few years ago,\nfor the day of the megaphone boomer is\npast, and Navadans are making less\nnoise bnt more money. They are not\nselling shares, but raising stock. They\nare not mining in the pnblio pocket, but\ndigging in Nevada\'* treaanre-honaea and\nprodooing ita mineral*.

At any rate, the de\npositors of the Eoreka County Bank\nwant their money, as no doubt the other\ncreditors of the Eoreka Live Stock Com\npany do.\nA statement published in the Journal\na few weeks ago that the State Banking\nBoard were conversant with the affairs\nof the Eoreka Life Stock Company as\nan asset of the Eureka Connty Bank is\nstill fresh in the minds of the Eureka\npeople, who are still wondering why, if\nthe State Banking Board were looking\nafter it so oarefully, none of the large\nsums of money realized from sales of\nsheep, lambs, cattle, eto., were never\napplied to the indebtedness of that com\npany to the Eoreka County Bank, but\nwere evidently permitted to be ap\npropriated to the personal needs of the\nSmiths.\nIf the depositor* have recently re\nquested Mr. Witober to take oharge of\nthe affairs of the Bank, it is not a mat\nter oommonly known on the streets\nhere. Some of the depositors may have\ndone eo, certainly not all or any large\nperoentage of tlioua, um can we leern\nwho any of them are who may have done\nso. And to what purpose, if suoh re\nquests were made! The affairs of the\nEureka County Bank are in charge of\nour Court, a matter of warm congratu\nlation to the depositors.\nThe State Banking Board seem very\nassured that they were “exonerated\ncompletely’’ by the Grand Jnry. May\nbe so. We see no referenoe to It in the\npartial report of that body published in\nto-day’s Sixtikxl. Nor do we see how\nthe Grand Jnry or any one else is going\nto completely exonerate the action of the\nState Banking Board in keeping a bank\nopen and allowing the reoeipt of thous\nands of dollars on deposit, for something\nlike $60,000 has been plaoed on deposit\nin the bank to onr oertain knowledge\nsince it was known to be insolvent. It\nis poor oonsolation to suoh depositors to\nlearn from the State Banking Board\nthat this was done to protect a con pie of\nbanks in the southern part of the State,\napparently looted by the same parties\nthat got away with the money here.\nPossibly the State Banking Board\nknow something more of the proceed\nings of the Grand Jnry than outsiders\nare generally supposed to learn—even\nwe ourselves hare have hoard\nia open court from the Iipe of the Dis\ntrict Attorney the afternoon the Grand\nJury reported to the Court the indict\nmeote found, that Mr. Witcher we*\nexpected to return to Eoreka about\nApril *0 and would hare more matter\nto preeent to the Grand Jury for its\nconsideration. Tbs District Attorney\nopon the strength of the expected re\nturn of Mr Witcher from certain part*\nof southern Kys County requested the\nCoart to not discharge the jury, hot to\nexcuse them temporarily. The Court\noom plied with the request, bat so\nfar Mr. Witcher bus failed to taro\nap, and ao that matter stand*\nat present. It ia a mistake, how\never, to think there is no further work\nfor a Grand Jury in the matter at hand.\nWe even beard moch ts.k of "dollar\nfor dollar" to depositors, of valuable\nproperties owned and controlled by the\nSmiths that would probably more than\npay dollar for dollar, until some people\nLttO w ova ra*l!j aoaaxxl At ihtJ 8t#t?\nBanking Board daring Co close a bank\nwhich waa in each excellent circum\nstance#.\nIt ban been mere than a rumor that\nthe present baok examiner himself\ncounseled delay in proceeding with\nany action against the chief officials of\nthe bank, on the grounds that the de\npositors would thereby be benefited by\nan increase of assets.\nWell, action was certainly delayed,\nMr. Witcher haa never returned, the\ni.v. v -3 filed petition*\ny in the United\n, which actioo,\nres certain at\nleried for the\n1 Coonty Bank,\n.tors will now\n:b the outside\nI creditors of these people.\n-.hat the delay\nbenefit of the\nI bank off! .ala ?\nation” so fre\nlot thoroughly\n; 1 o’- - ,i here.\n1 bank and the\nth whom?) of\n1 to place a re\ndance with the\nals and them\n* . o discredit the\naction taken by Judge Breen for the\nbenefit of the depositors of that bank,\nwe have heard of no co-operation what\never, and we hardly expect to from now\non.\nThe people outside of Uarska Ovun\'y\noan believe ns that the haloe so com\nplacently worn by the State Banking\nBoard were not placed on their brow*\nby the depositors of the Eareka County\nBank.\nPARDY ESTATE WINS DECISION\nThe Nevada Supreme Court Sustains\nthe Findings of Our District Court\nA letter received by Frank Kopp in\nterested in a lease on the disputed prop\nerty, from Judge Massey of Reno.brings\nthe news that the Supreme Court sev\neral days ago handed down a decision\naffirming the judgment of our District\nConrt in favor of the estate of John\nPardy, deceased, in the case of Mitchell\nvs. Pardy.\nHistory of tho Cato\nIn 1889 Maurice Hartnett relocated a\nmining claim called the Grindstone, sit\nuated on the east side of Prospect Moun\ntain, Eureka mining district, styling the\nlocated claim the Sam Tilden,\nIn 1898 Pardy, nnder the contention\nthat Hartnett had failed for many years\nto do the annual assessment work on\nthe Tilden, relocated the ground as the\nBeehive. In 1906 Angus Gibson and W.\nO. Stewart onoe more made a relocation\nof the ground, oalling their claim the\nFanny, and did so upon the contention\nthat Pardy being a Deputy TJ. S. Min\neral Surveyor oonld not make a valid\nmining location. The same technical\nquestion was then being determined by\nthe Supreme Court in the eait from\nLincoln County, and so it was agreed\nthat the suit to quiet title begun against\nPardy by Gibson and Stewart should\nabide the decision of the court in the\nlast named oase. The Supreme Court\nin 1907 decided in favor of the right of\na Deputy U. S. Mineral Surveyor to\nmake a valid location, and this\nholding left Gibson and Stewart\nwithout a oase, and with their oonsent\nit was dismissed. Before the dissmiss\nal of the last named oase. however, H.\nK. Mitchell, who had acquired Hart\nnett’s title to the Sam Tilden, came in\nas an lntervenor, and the cause came\non for trial in June, 1908. The ver\ndict of the jury and the judgment of the\noourt was in favor of Pardy. The in\nterveuor moved for a new trial, which\nwas denied by the Distriot Court, and\nhence the appeal to the higher tri\nbunal, which has finally determined\nthe rights of the respective parties in\nfavor of the estate of John Pardy, who\ndied here more than a year ago.\nThe deoision in the Mitohell-Pardy\ncase leaves onr local District Court with a\nolean slate, no oase having been revers\ned or sent back for a new trial during\nthe seven years and five months Judge\nBreen has been on the bench of Eureka\nOoanty.\nBORN _\na.

The different fire\ncompeuies responded quickly, and\nwere soon at the scene of the fire, bnt\nConsiderable time was spent in making\nboss connections and taming on of (he\nwater, owing to the greater distance\nfrom the nearest fire ping, at the Eu\ngene Ueraty residence, to the horning\nbuilding.\nTbe origin of the fire ie unknown.\nIn au interview with Mrs. Evans she\ngave the Sentinel the following de\ntails regarding tbe conflagration:\n“My dwelliug consisted of a kitchen,\ndiniug room and two bedrooms. I was\nin the kitchen with three of my child\nren, who were arranging some wild\nflowers into bonqnets that they intend\ned carrying iu the procession of school\nchildren that afternoon. My yonugest\nchild, aged three years, was asleep at\nthe time in oue of tbe bedrooms. In\norder to reach the bednoms it was\nnecessary to pass from the kitchcu\nthrough tbe diuiug room. While iu\nthe kitchen 1 heard a crackling sound\noome from tbe bedroom, but uot tbe\noue where the child was sleepiog. 1\nrushed through the diniug room, and\nou opening the bedroom door was met\nwith a burst of flame. I then ran in\nto the adjoining bedroom, quickly\npicked the baby up in my arms from\ntbe lied and rau from tbe house. In\npassing through the flames my hair\nwas partially singed and one of my\narms and bauds slightly burned. I\nbad been in thia room w here I discover\ned the fire but a short lime before aud\nfound everything all right.\n“Shortly after running from tbe\nburning house I heard an explosion.\nSome say the concussion was so grea\'\nthat it most have bucu caused by giant\npowder. I never knew of there being\nthat kiud of powder anywhere in tbe\nbouse. There was a can of coal oil in\noue of the rooms and the report may\nhave been caused from that when it\nexploded. Betides tbe loss of the dwell\ning the entire contents were consum\ned, and nothing was saved bnt the\nclothing we had on at the time. Uy\nhusbtud was not at home when the\ntire occurred, being out at Antelope\nValley after horses."\nThe stone cabin that adjoined the\nEvans\' residence, owned by Bernard\nZuuioo, who is at present ont working\non a ranch, was completely gutted by\ntire, aud all tbe furniture aud bsddiDg\nentirely destroyed.\nFortunately only a slight breeze wae\nblowing at the time or the Curto resi\ndence on the Dorth aud ihe McBride\ndwelling on the south would probably\nalso have met the same fate.\nMEETING OF BANKRUPT CREDITORS\nReferee Sends Out Notices for Meeting\nat Riverside Hotel in Reno\nReceiver Spencer Reynolds of the\nEureka County Bank on Tuesday re\nceived notices of a meeting of the credi\ntors of Oscar J.

Jcry, J\nRoads and Bridgss\nTo the Foreman of the Grand Jury—\nWe, your Committee on Roads and\nBridges beg leave to submit the follow\ning report:\nWe have visited and inspected the\nroads and bridges in and about the\ntown of Eureka. We have interviewed\nranches, teamsters, travelers and peo\nple generally relative to conditions of\nroads and bridges in all parts of the\ncounty.\nAs to Eureka and vioinlty, we And\nthe roads and bridges in very good re\npair and but little damaged by the re\ncent floods, comparatively speaking.\nAs to the outlying districts, particularly\nthe north end ol the county, they are\nstill in a deplorable and almost impass\nable condition, but are rapidly being\nimproved, thanks to our County Com\nmissioners, ranohers and teamsters,\nfor the creditable manner and Interest\nthey have taken in the repairing of the\nroads and bridges.\nIn looking over the statutes relative\nto road work we And that the County\nCommissioners are greatly handioapped\nby law, and technically not over 9100 is\nallowed on a single pieoe of work unless\nadvertised in four issues of a oonnty .\nnewspaper and let byoontraot. Now,\nas the recent floods bars caused dam\nage to roads which will exceed $100 in\ntheir repair, and as their immediate\nrebuilding was imperative, we sanction\nand uphold onr most able District At\ntorney in handing down an official\nopinion that the present need was\nan emergency oaae that permitted the\nOommiasionera to go beyond the provi\nsions of the statutes and repair without\ndelay the most traveled roads and\nbridges.\nWe recommend that aa onr Commis\nsioner, W. H. Sweeney, duriug flood\ntime was very faithful and bard work\ning at the north end of the connty in\nrepairing the roads and bridges, and\nas be alone saved several hundred dol\nlars in preventing the Southern Pacific\nofficials from dynamiting the connty\nbridge at Palisade, we recommend and\nadvocate that he be reimbursed for ac\ntual expenses inonrred while in the\nperformance of his duty at the north\nend of the county during the last of\nMarch and the beginning of April, 1910.\nWe further reoommend to the mem\nbers of the Legislature that the law be\nso amended that the Board of Connty\nCommissioners of Eureka Connty can\nbaild and repair road* and bridges to\nthe extent of $500, instead of $100,\nwithout first advertising for the same,\nand that the emergencey danse in the\nroad law be amended so as to read aa\nfollows: "That in ease of emergency\nthe Board of Connty Commissioners\ncan let the contract on the spot for any\namount."\nWe also recommend to the members\nof the Legislature that the Couutv\nCommissioners of Eureka County fc .\nallowed their actual traveling expenses\nwhile in the performance of their doty\nin in specting and overseeing road and\nbridge work.\nThere is one point and suggestion we\nwish to make to the Connty Commis\nsioners, and that is, as the.connty has\nno road supervisors, said oflioe having\nbeen abolished by the Legislature, and\nas the statutes do not make any provi\nsion for payment for use of tools and\nimplements neoessary in repairing roads,\nthat the oounty purchase and include\nin its equipment one or more Twen\ntieth Century Graders, this grader be\ning capable when operated by one man\nand four horses of doing more road\nwork in one day than 30 men with picks\nand shovels could do in the same time.\nWe do not declare or intimate that the\nabove mentioned grader will do away\nwith pick and shovel, as we realize and\nknow the necessity of hand work at\ntimes and places, but we do know that\non stretohes that require grading, level\ning or smoothing the said graders can\nnot be equaled, and would be a great\nsaving in oost.\nRobert D.

Few persons\nwill question the sinoerity of that\nstatement, and it is probably true.\nBut what sort of law-making is to\nbe expected from men who buy United\nStates Senatorships ? These millionaire\ncorruptionists do not sell their own\nvotes, but they cannot be trusted to\nserve tho public. Their interests and\ntheir sympathies are on the side of\nmonopoly and privilege, and they act\naccordingly on all proposed legislation.\nThere are various ways of baying\nSenatorships, although the direct pri\nmary nominating laws in ounierons\nSlates have put a wholesome check on\nthe trafflo.\nCue of the\'most favored and success\nful means of acquisition consists in\npaying the “election expenses” of can\ndidates for the Legislature. By ad\nvancing a lump sum for this purpose,\nwith an ample margin for contingent\noutlays, the political friendship and\nsupport of the would-be legislator is,\nas it were, cemented.\nA simpler and more wholesale method\nis to do the business through the State\nCentral Committee, which distributes\nthe largest where it is most needed or\n“will do the most good,” some little of\nit no doubt adhering to the channels of\ntransmission.\nThis is the Guggenheim plan, which\nsurprised Colorado with a new Repub\nlican Senator who had not even been\nuamed for the plaoe.\nIn addition to milliouairea who thus\npave their way to the Senate with solid\ngold, there are members who are rela\nI lively poor, but not too proud to owe\n1 tbeir election to the fevor ol powerful\ncorporation* io control of Legislature*.\nThi* group i* composed mainly of\ncorporation lawyers, like Flint of Cali\nfornia, who do not bite the hand of\nadvancement wich the teeth of ingrati\ntude, however personally honest thsy\nmay bs.\nThen there are Senators, such aa Aid\nrich of Rhode Island, who although\nmoderately rich and independent,\nneither buy their seata nor owe their\nelection directly to the favor of corpora\ntions, yet from association and self\ninterest always ally themselves with the\nrailroads, the trusts and Wall Street.\nThese men may be neither corrupt\nnor corrupting, in a money sense, but\nthey are dangerous in proportion to their\nability.\nAldriob, for example, is a far worse\nenemy to the pnblic welfare than a\nmerely pnrcbasaule Senator, because\nof his parliamentary ability and his\nskill as a trader and log-roller.\nHe is the acknowledged leader of the\nRepublican Regulars, not because of\nstatamanship or devotion to principle,\nbut because of his practical knowledge\nand long experience, and the craft and\nskill he brings to bear to promote or de\nfeat legislation.\nLike Senatorial groups are found in\nthe Democratic minority. One party is\nno better than the other with respect to\nSenatorial representation.\nAmi there is a very respectable mi\nnority of Insorgent Republicans and\nindependent Democrats who may be\ntrusted to stand for popular rights and\nagainst corporate greed and aggression,\nregardless of partisan considerations.\nThe Senate should be brought closer\nto The People, so that it shall cease to\nbe the stronghold of the Interests.\nThe way to work the change is\nthrough direct primary nominations for\nSenatorships, followed by a direct pop\nular vote at the succeeding general\nelection, as in Oregon and some other\nStates.\nThe Slack Hawk War\nOn May 14, 1832, began what is known\nin American history as the Black Hawk\nwar. It was little more than a “brush”\nbetween the United States troops and\nthe Indians, which occurrences were\nquite frequent in those days, and this\nwar is noted chiefly through the pictur\nesqueness of the Indian chief who has\ngiven it its name.\nIn 1812 Black Hawk was persuaded by\nTecumseh to joiu the British ranks as\na brigadier general. With 500 native\nfollowers he did valiant deeds against\nthe United States, and incidentlly\nlearned muoh about civilized warfare.\nKeokuk, head chief of the tribe, was—\nor pretended to be—a friend of the gov\nernment. Black Hawk hated Keokuk.\nA treaty had been made whereby for a\nyearly payment of $1000 the Sacs and\nFoxes were to turn over to the white\nmen a 700-mile tract of land east of the\nMississippi river. Accordingly Keokuk\nand his followers moved west aoross the\nriver. Blaok Hawk refused to go. He\nsaid the officers had made the chiefs\ndrunk and trloked them into the unfair\ntreaty. He started a confederacy of the\nneighboring tribes for the purpose of\ndestroying all settlers who should try to\nseise the Indian lands.\nBloodshed followed. Being sssnred\nthat many tribes would flock to his stan\ndard, he foand himself on the brink of\nwar with the Government. He succeed\ned in drawing to his oaose less than\nhalf the following he needed for snoh a\nconflict. He sent a flag of trace to the\nGovernment force that was pursuing\nhim. The Indian who bore the flag\nwas shot down by the soldiers, whereat\nBlack Hawk, in fury, attacked the\ntroops, consisting of upwards of 1000\nmen, and on May 14, with only 70 In\ndians pat them to root. The war was on.\nBlack Hawk swept like wildfire\nthrough the nearby settlements, leav\ning flame and death in his wake. The\nGovernment saw it had a real frontier\nwar on its hands, and sent broadcast a\ncall for troops. In the conflict that\nfollowed there were four officers who\nwere later to win national fame. They\nwere Abraham Lincoln, Wiufleld Scott,\nZachary Taylor and Jefferson Davis.\nBlack Hawk attacked Apple River\nfort od Jane 24, 1832, and next day de\nfeated a strong detachment of United\nStates troops. Bat the odds against\nhim were too severe. As the white\nsoldiers massed in greater numbers\nBlack Hawk and his gallant braves were\nforced gradually backward, fighting\nfuriously for every inch of the way un\ntil they reached the mouth of the Bad\nAx river. A United States steamship\nlay off the shore. Black Hawk sent for\nward a flag of truce. The steamship\ndisregarded the white flag and hurled\nshells into the Indian camp, where\nsquaws and papooses were huddled.The\ni pursuing troops finished the root. The\nIndian army was cut to pieces. Black\nHawk esoaped, but was soon captured.\nHe was held prisoner for months at Fort\nress Mouroe, then taken on a tour of\nNew York and other big oities, that he\nmight see the full power of the white\nman. He was at last permitted to re\nturn home, only to find that the Gov\nernment had made Keokuk chief of his\nold-time warriors. Beaten, deposed\nfrom rank and power, homeless, hope\nless, the old chief did not long survive\nhis disgrace. He died Ootober 3, 1838,\nuear Dea Moines, la. As a final humili\nation to his memory his body was stolen\nfrom the grave by a western doctor.\nState News From Exckanges\nLouis Somers of the Goldfield High\nSchool and Amelia Tremain of the\nSnsanville High School won the first\nhonors at the recant prise speaking con\ntest at Reno.\nCounterfeitflve dollar pieces almost!\ndefying detection are being circulated at ,\nBattle Mountain and Halleck, Nevada.

The work of re\nbuilding the line around the southern\nend of Great Salt Lake has been inter\nfered with by recent storms so that the\nline will not be opened for through freight\nservice for some time.\nAll railroad building* in Verdi will\nbe moved about half a mile to the west\nward of their present site, in order to\nobviate the necessity of stopping on t\ngrade as at present. Work on the demo\nlition of the passenger, freight depot and\nsheds has been started. Residents ol\nVerdi are decideiy averse to the move,\nas it will probably mean that the town\nwill have to move half a mile also.\nAlthough only eight years old and\nsmall ior his age, Willie Graves, an\nEly boy, is said to be a skilled burglar,\nand is in the hands of the local officers\ncharged with burglary. He is accused\nof entering the home of Mr. and Mrs.\nLawrence Doyle and of stealing a lady’s\ngold watch, a locket, purse and other\narticles. He pried open a window to\ngaio an entrance to the house and was\nleaving through this window with the\nstolen articles when arrested.\nA Ogden firm has been awarded a\ncontract to lengthen nearly all the side\ntracks on the Southern Pacific from\nOgden throngh Nevada! covering eev\nera! hundred mile* of work and involv\ning a heavy ontlwy on the part of the\nHarriman road.
