        <pre>['Published July, 1944\n566 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nVARIABILITY IN THE SPECIES BET A VULGARIS L. \nIN RELATION TO BREEDING POSSIBILITIES \nWITH SUGAR BEETS 1 \nF. v. 0WEN2 \nTHE species of beets known as Beta vulgaris L. includes sugar beets, mangel wurzels, red table beets, and Swiss chard. For practical \npurposes most forms of the wild beet, B. maritima L. might also be \nincluded, because most all these beets cross readily with the domesticated\nvarieties. This represents a great range of variability. Much \nvariability also exists within varieties. The extent of this genetic \nvariability accounts for the success of previous efforts ii.l applied \nbreeding work, and it indicates the existence of a valuable source of \nbiological material that may be molded into more valuable forms in \nthe future. \nWhile recognizing this genetic variability, an equally great source \nof environmental variability must also be considered. Beet development\nis so strongly dependent upon environmental conditions that \na study of heredity and environment must go together. \nIt should not be implied, however, that environmental variability \nalways represents a handicap in connection with breeding work. When \nproperly understood and controlled, environmental influences may \nconstitute an invaluable aid to the breeder. This point may be illustrated\nby relating some experiences in breeding beets for resist-\nance to the virus disease known as curly-top. Twenty-five years ago \nthe ·possibility of producing curly-top-resistant varieties of sugar \nbeets was something that nobody was too sure about. Progress was \nslow at first and improvements in degree of resistance were small. \nBy I928, Carsner, et al. (3)3 had brought together several strains \nwith slight to moderate degrees of resistance. In 1929 the important \ndecision was made of mixing all of these strains together. The resulting\nmixed variety was designated U. S. I. The significant thing about \nthis heterogeneous material from the geneticist\'s viewpoint was \nthe occasional appearance of what seemed to be highly resistant \nindividual beets. Back in 1930 and I93 I it was not known whether \nthese outstanding individual beets were really as resistant as they \nappeared, whether they escaped infection altogether, or whether they \nwere influenced in their growth by some special environmental factors.\nIt was eventually learned that their development was affected \nby both environmental and heritable influences. \nMore recent progress with curly-top resistance has been most \nsignificantly affected by a better knowledge of the environmental \nvariability. It was learned that young beets were more easily infected \n1Contribution to the symposium on "Sugar Beets in the War and Post-War \nPeriods" held at the annual meeting of the Society on Cincinnati, Ohio, November \n10, 1943· Received for publication February 28, 1944· \n2Geneticist, Division of Sugar Plant Investigations, Bureau of Plant Industry, \nSoils, and Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Research Administration, U.

This information has made it possible \nto establish drastic curly-top exposures in midsummer plantings. \nThese drastic exposures have been found to have a profound effect \nupon selection and evaluation work. Under mild or only moderately \nsevere exposures, curly-top resistance has the appearance of a dominant\ncharacter. When hybrids between resistant and susceptible \ntypes were tested under the less drastic environments, the F1 plants \nresembled the resistant parent (1). Under the more drastic exposures \nnow made possible by midsummer plantings, dominance is lacking, \nand the F 1 hybrids resemble the susceptible parent much more than \nthe resistant parent. Hence, the character might now be regarded as \nrecessive rather than dominant. When selections were made under \nthe less drastic environments where the F 1 hybrids could not be distinguished,\nsegregation for relatively susceptible types were expected \ni.n the next generation. Under the more severe curly-top exposures, \nheterozygous individuals can be detected and eliminated. \nA study of environmental variability is equally important in connection\nwith breeding for resistance to any of the other beet diseases. \nSuch studies are particularly significant in connection with breeding \nfor increased resistance to bolting. Progress is impeded in connection \nwith breeding ·for increased yield or sugar percentage because so \nlittle is known about controlling environmental variability. \nThe mechanization of harvest operations raises new problems and \nno doubt the breeder can be helpful, but there are likely to be disappointments\nif environmental variability is not fully recognized. \nPerhaps the most important thing the breeder can do is to increase \ngenetic uniformity. It will take work to produce varieties of beets \nwith uniformly shaped roots and with uniform crowns and foliar \ngrowth, but there are definite indications that this goal can be ac<:omplished.\nGenetic variability is also important in connection with characters \nthat might be designated as breeders' tools. These characters do not \n.affect yield directly, but they determine to a large extent what a \nbreeder can plan to do in the way of developing breeding methods. \nOne of the most convenient tools consists of a simple hypocotyl color \ncharacter commonly used for a marker. In hybridization work the \nuse of this character makes it possible to plan systems of matings \nwhereby desired hybrids can be distinguished from other offspring \nwhich may not be hybrids. \nBeets are especially variable with regards to sterility and incompatability\nrelationships. Most sugar beets are inclined to be strongly \nself sterile, unless one provides an environment to induce selfing. \nHighly self-fertile types of beets exist, however. A type of self fertility \nfound in one of the early curly-top resistant varieties appears to be \ndetermined by a single gene. With a knowledge of the rules of the \noppositional hypothesis, this gene for self fertility can be readily transferred\nto any material where it is desired (4). This high degree of self-\nfertility is even more noticeable in the vigorous F 1 hybrids than in the \nless vigorous beets obtained after selfing. \nMale sterility may become another important breeders' tool. It \n", '568 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nfacilitates hybridization work, and for this reason it is useful in connection\nwith many types of investigations. There are different types \nof male sterility in beets, but the most useful type appears to be one \nproduced by cytoplasmic inheritance. After selecting against genes \nthat have a modifying effect, the inheritance of this type of male \nsterility follows the simple rules of maternal inheritance. B v successive\nback-crossing the male-sterile equivalent of most varieties \nand of most inbred lines can be established. This cytoplasmicallyinherited\nmale sterility produces emasculation of flowers on a grand \nscale. If the male parent has been selected against the modifying \ngenes, whole populations of infinite size may be completely male \nsterile. In the work with curly-top-resistant varieties the male-sterile\nequivalents of some of the best strains have now been established, \nbut any thought of commercial utilization will depend upon further \nresearch, especially with breeding methods. \nThe knowledge of past success in breeding work adds confidence, \nbut it is still difficult to look into the future and predict what may be \ndone to- establish a desirable character that appears to be practically \nnon-existent. This is the present situation in this country with regards \nto prospects of developing unilocular biotypes of beets with singlegermed\nseed balls. All of the present commercial varieties of sugar \nbeets bear multilocular or multiple-germed seed balls, and this adds \ngreatly to .the task of thinning. The new and popular technic of shearing\nor splitting the seed balls into single-seeded portions, represents \nan artificial approach to the problem. It would seem that this artificial\nmethod should be considered only as a temporary answer, and \nthe sheared, or segmented, seed might best be regarded as a victory \nmodel. \nThe problem of selecting for single-germed beet seed was popularized\nin this country a generation ago, but the work met with dis-\nGouragement and was discontinued. A report of Russian work published\nin 1941 (2) seems to be the most encouraging news and indi-\ncates highly significant progress, as follows: "In the U.S.S.R., breeding\nwork for the production of unilocular ot single-germ varieties \nwas originated by the Glav-Sakhar Breeding Station. In 1934 examinations\nwere made in a large number of sugar beet seed fields and \nindividual plants were selected from those in which all or most of the \nseed balls were unilocular. The seeds collected from such plants constituted\nthe original material used in our work. The character for single-\ngerm seed is under ordinary conditions recessive. In the F2 generation, \nthe plants segregate into types with unilocular and multilocular seedballs.\nThe unilocular types were characterized by vigorous vegetative \ndevelopment and a peculiar type of seed bush. (Data are given showing\na strong but not complete correlation between the unilocular \ncharacter and an extreme non-bolting tendency.) While the number \nof seeds in a seed ball is found to vary greatly in ordinary beet \nvarieties, depending upon environment, the new unilocular varieties \nare very constant. We were not able to change the number of flowers \nin the unilocular types of plants although we varied our dates \nof planting, nutrition, environment (both outdoor planting and green-\n', 'OWEN: BREEDING POSSIBILITIES WITH SUGAR BEETS 569 \nhouse). We have thus produced lines of sugar beets which are constant \nfor the character of single-germ seed." \nIn searching for biotypes with unilocular seed balls, the hope of utilizing\nthe wild beet, B. maritima, may not be promising because so far \nas is knownit produces multilocular seed balls, the same as those of \nthe domesticated beet varieties. However, unilocular seed balls are \nproduced by other wild species. B. lomatogona produces unilocular \nseed balls_ and it has been hybridized with sugar beets. The F 1 offspring\nhave been strongly sterile, but hope from this work should not \nbe abandoned. If other methods fail in the search for unilocular types \nof beets, extensive X-ray work could well be attempted to increase \nthe possibiltiy of a mutation that might be utilized. \nLITERATURE CITED \n1.
