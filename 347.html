        <pre>['“The men who have produced this war, \nand into whose hands England has \nfallen in these sad times, will pass \naway. Rhodes, Chamberlain, and Milner may attain\nthe gold, or the power, or the titles, or the \nglory to which they have aspired; then they will \npass away. But the young South African people \nnow coming to its birth in these days of stress \nand anguish, and which today \nlies prostrate with the blood \nupon its forehead for baptismal \nwater weighing down its eyelids—the\nyoung South African \npeople will live and grow. It will \nwax with the centuries, and to it \nbelongs the future.” \nThe antiwar critic Olive \nSchreiner wrote these words in 1900, when the \nAnglo-Boer War (now known as the South African \nWar) was fully under way. By singling out the \nthree men whom she held responsible for the \nBritish jingoism that led to hostilities, she was \nalso affirming her own sympathies with the Boer \ncause. The power of her words now lies not in her \ncondemnation of the British colonial leaders Cecil \nRhodes, Joseph Chamberlain, and Alfred Milner, \nbut in her optimistic prediction of the rebirth of \nSouth Africa and the emergence of the “young \nSouth African people.” Her vision of what the \nnation would become is part of a long tradition of \nprojects to rejuvenate South Africa—an entity that \nhas had several different manifestations since the \nmid-nineteenth century.\nIn 1853, the Cape Colony was granted a liberal\nconstitution that gave the colonists a certain \namount of independence from the mother country.\nThis constitution was defined by its non-\nracialism: It gave the franchise (albeit limited to \nliterate and property-owning males) to people of \ncolor. This liberality lasted until 1936, when the \nlast black person was removed from this nonracial\nvoters’ roll. \nIn 1910, another renewal came with the formation\nof the Union of South Africa, preceded by a \ntruce between the British and the Boers. The constitutional\nnegotiations to form a union were, like \nthe process of the 1990s, premised on the notion \nof reconciliation. As a result, \nSouth Africa ended up with \nmultiple centers of power—the \nlegislature is seated in Cape \nTown while the administrative \ncapital is Pretoria. The exclusion\nof Africans from the uni-\nfication conventions prompted \nthem to establish the South \nAfrican Native National Congress in 1912—the \norganization that became the African National \nCongress. \nHowever, unification was not the last instance \nof national rejuvenation. In 1960, white South \nAfricans voted in a referendum to establish a republic.\nAt the time, the assumption was that South \nAfrica would remain in the Commonwealth, and \ntherefore that English-speaking South Africans \nwould not be cut off from Britain and other imperial\nties. This compromise position was rejected \nat a meeting of Commonwealth prime ministers \nwho also criticized the country’s apartheid policies,\nand South Africa was effectively ejected from \nthe organization.\nThese few examples suffice to illustrate the \nfact that South Africa is a country whose physical\nand constitutional shape has gone through \nseveral alterations. Although it could be argued \nthat these changes were mainly about and driven \nby colonial and imperial interests—to the exclusion\nof the majority African population—on close \ninspection Africans can be seen and heard making \ntheir claims and contributions, even if they were \nignored. Importantly, these examples point to the \nrecurring theme of reconciliation. Whether it was \nBOOKS\n197\nAfter Freedom: The Rise of \nthe Post-Apartheid Generation \nin Democratic South Africa\nby Katherine S. Newman  \nand Ariane De Lannoy.\nBeacon Press, 2014.\nYouth and the Future  \nof the New South Africa\nHLONIPHA MOKOENA\nHLONIPHA MOKOENA is an associate professor of anthropology\nat Columbia University.\n', '198 • CURRENT HISTORY • May 2015\nin the post–South African War negotiations or in \nthe Convention for a Democratic South Africa in \nthe early 1990s, South Africans have accepted the \nfact that ours is not a homogeneous country in \nwhich one ethnic, racial, or political group can \nreign supreme to the exclusion of others. By constantly\nfinding reasons to “heal the wounds of the \npast,” South Africans have learned from historical \nexperience how to deal with the hubris of the victors\nwhile assuaging the wounded identities of the \ndefeated.\nWith this in mind, After Freedom: The Rise of \nthe Post-Apartheid Generation in Democratic South \nAfrica should be read as an evaluation of, and \ncommentary on, South Africa’s latest incarnation \nas a democratic and constitutional state. In their \nsociological study, Katherine S. Newman and \nAriane De Lannoy have interviewed and followed \nthe lives of seven young South Africans who represent,\nin various ways, the aftereffects of democ-\nratization and the dissolution of apartheid’s racial \npolicies. Through the direct \nand indirect voices of their \ninterviewees, the authors seek \nto answer a vexing question: \nHas anything changed at all \nor are many young people still \nhamstrung by the legacies of \napartheid? This question also \npoints to a generational divide: \n“People who lived through the struggle against \napartheid can see progress, but younger people, \nthe people of the book, wonder whether they can \nrely on the social changes that have transpired or \nwhether they need to focus on what remains to be \naccomplished.”\nTo compensate for an absence of comparative \nperspective, the authors have chosen to compare \nSouth Africa with the United States after the Civil \nWar. Their title is borrowed from the anthropologist\nHortense Powdermaker, who published her \nbook After Freedom: A Cultural Study of the Deep \nSouth in 1939. The difficulty is that while the \nauthors may look to this American antecedent as \na useful measure, their interviewees do not: The \nmajority have been shaped by the South African \ncondition and therefore would not necessarily\ncompare themselves to the African Americans \nwho lived through the post–Civil War Reconstruction\nera.\nMoreover, even from a theoretical perspective \nthe American South analogy is useful only to a \npoint, since South Africa’s racial divide is not \njust between black and white; it is also about \nthe chasms among those formerly oppressed by \napartheid—blacks, Indians, and coloreds (people \nof mixed-race descent). Because apartheid apportioned\nprivileges according to a racial hierarchy, \nthe end of apartheid has meant not just the end of \nthese graduated privileges but also a realignment \nof the different categories of “non-Europeans.” \nThis is what makes South Africa different from \nthe American South. It explains, for example, why \nAmbrose, who has grown up poor in the “colored” \ntownship of Manenberg, “rejects out of hand the \nnotion that he is of African blood.”\nYOUNG AND RESTLESS\nThese fissures seem to have their most dramatic \neffects on the poorest and most deprived of the \nstudy’s participants. Thandiswa cannot escape \nthe boredom and ennui that makes her feel “just \nlike a statue,” while Ambrose is “so bored most \nof the time that the very idea of a purpose or \ntask that needs attention is like \na tonic.” In countless examples\nthroughout the book, the \ninterviewees seem to be caught \nbetween the normal ebbs and \nflows of being young and restless\nand the “pathologies” of \nthe restricted and claustrophobic\nenvironments and homes \nthey have grown up in. The presence of the \nauthors seems to be yet another intrusion in a \nworld that is already lacking in privacy. \nWhen read as an evaluation of the condition of \nyouth in post-apartheid South Africa, the study \nachieves many of its aims. However, what the book \nseems to lack is an explanation of the culture that \nmany of the young people are caught up in. Here \nand there the presence of American symbols of \nsuccess and status is noted: a baby who is called \nBeyoncé or Amanda’s “ideal career . . . as a TV \nnewscaster or actress.” But the authors hesitate \nto say why a young woman growing up in postapartheid\nSouth Africa would hold aspirations that \nare projections of what she watches on television. \nFrom the many expressions of frustrated ambitions,\nit could be concluded that even if the South \nAfrican government held up its side of the bargain \nand provided clean water, housing, electricity, and \ndecent schooling, there would still be many listless \nyoung people who feel hemmed in. No amount of \nstate intervention can fulfill ambitions of “modern \nwomanhood,” which for a previous generation \nOne of the most unexpected  \nconsequences of the  \nend of apartheid is the  \nemergence of nostalgia.\n', 'Youth and the Future of the New South Africa • 199\nwere embodied by the models and superstars who \nappeared in Drum magazine and are now most \nvividly displayed in glamorous soap operas such \nas Generations.\nWhen Zizipho tells the authors that “the old \nregime was evil,” but also argues that “it was more \nstable,” she hits upon one of the most unexpected \nconsequences of the end of apartheid, namely the \nemergence of nostalgia. In his 2009 book Native \nNostalgia, Jacob Dlamini underscored that this \nphenomenon is not just a longing for the “good \nol’ days of apartheid” but also a longing for the \nsocial order and moral rectitude that people associate\nwith those times—a longing that cuts across \nracial and class lines. Where Dlamini differs from \nNewman and De Lannoy is that he takes this nostalgia\nseriously as an expression of what it means \nto be free:\nTo understand the question of what it means \nfor a black South African to remember his life \nunder apartheid with fondness is to appreciate \nthat the freedom of black South Africans did not \ncome courtesy of a liberation movement. There \nwere bonds of reciprocity and mutual obligation, \nsocial capital, that made it possible for millions \nto imagine a world without apartheid. To apply \nwhat E.P. Thompson said of the English working\nclass, black South Africans were present at \ntheir making as citizens. Freedom was not sent \nto them in a gift box from Lusaka. At the same \ntime, this is not to say that every black person \nwas against apartheid. That would be a lie.\nIf the end of apartheid was brought about not \njust by the upheavals in the townships and the \nwork of the anti-apartheid movement, but also \nby the millions who imagined “a world without \napartheid,” then it is also possible to explain the \npredicament of being young in post-apartheid \nSouth Africa in the same terms. As I am writing \nthis review, my alma mater, the University of Cape \nTown, is debating whether to remove the statue \nof Cecil Rhodes (Olive Schreiner’s nemesis) from \nits campus. Although many versions of the debate \ncan be seen in mainstream and social media, what \nis lacking is an engagement with the nostalgic elements\nof the protests and sit-ins. \nAs with the longing for the return of apartheid’s\n“social order,” the demand for the removal \nof Rhodes’s statue is framed by the nostalgic \nyearning to be “revolutionary.” The students \nseem to be desperately groping for the emotional,\npsychological, and ideological valence of \nthe generation of the 1960s and ’70s that fought \napartheid. Theirs is a nostalgia for the revolution \nthat they missed and now have to read about in \nthe history books. Theirs is for the most part a \nhashtag revolution. ■\n']</pre>
