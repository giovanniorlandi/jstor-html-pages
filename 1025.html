        <pre>['CHAPTER V \nTHE THEORY OF EARLY.CHILDHOOD ED"OCATION \nJOHN E. ANDERSC>:N \nDirector, Institute of Child Welfare \nUniverSity of Minnesota \nMinneapolis, MitJ.nesota \nWithin the larger framework of the philosoP-hy of education lies \nthe more limited theory that determines the selection of material~, \nthe organization of practices, and the assumptions upon which nursed\xad\nschool, kindergarten, and primary education are based. Both the larger \nframework and the more limited theory look to scientific research\' for \nprinciples and practices. As experience with young children is gaine<!J, \nprinciples and practices change and move on to new creative lev-els. \nTo understand the education of the young child, something must \nbe known of his world-the society in which he lives-and of his \nnature, his characteristics, and the manner in which he grows. Knowledge\nof the manner in which.he gains competence and security through \nlearning underlies insight into his adjustment. The organized experi ... \nences which facilitate this adjustment come to the child thr()ugh the \nteacher.·. \nOUR. SociETY Is DEMOCRATIC · \nOur society is a democratic society. Early childhood education, \ntherefore, is democratic in principle. It recognizes the dignity of the \nindividual and sti·esse,s co-operative and voluntary effort rather than \ncontrol. by domination and force. In a democratic society, goals are \ndetermined by the mutual consent of the members. Because a demo\xad\ncratic training program ass~es that its members· can take responsi\xad\nbility and meet obligations, it gives freedom to them. Jn \'a. clem6-"\'\ncratic society children are trained for responsibility, personal decision, \nand choice. \nOur society is a democratic society in a world that seeks to be.OOme \none world. A deadly war has just been waged against the overriding \nwHl of a small groupof self-seeking persons in order to preserve the \n\' tights of the people to make their own choices a,nd to work togethet· for \n70 \n', "ANDERSON 71 \nsooial purpose!$. Into this world a new force-atomic energy~has come. \nIt cttn be used destructively to abolish our civilization or constructively \nto bring benefits and progress to all. Its discovery puts before all \nmembers of society the problem of world unity. The education of \nyoung children must be fitted into the concepts of a democratic so\xad\nciety and of a world which seeks to solve its major problems by co\xad\noperation and united effort. \nTHE GROWTH PROCESS AND THE TIME DIMENSION \nThe child from two to six years is not stationary . and fixed but is \n· moving through a growth period, itself imbedded in the larger period \nthat extends from co:qception to maturity. In turn, this is a part of \neven a greater period that includes the whole life cycle from birth .to \ndeath. In growth the organism changes from a single cell to an adult \nwith a complex bodily structure and very involved behavior. In the \nfirst twenty years of the life cycle much energy goes to growth and de\xad\nvelopment. In the adult, energy goes to the maintenance of life proc\xad\nesses. A growing organism is then in a state of becoming, which means \nthat it is called upon not only to adjust its own level. but to prepare \nfor adjustment in the future. \nEducation for Present or Future. Two theories of education have \nhad much vogue in the past. At the extremes, one holds that education's \npurpose is preparation for adult living, with little or no reference to \npresent needs. The other holds that education should develop about \nthe child's immediate needs and interests, irrespective of future de\xad\nmands or responsibilities, on the assumption that, by living each \nmoment fully, the best preparation for the f11ture is given. The pro\xad\nponents of these views have vigorously attacked one another. De\xad\nvelopmentally' time is a dimension through which the child moves, \nwith each stage of growth intimately related to that which precedes \nand that which follows. Not only does the child carry his past for\xad\nward with him but in his very nature, as an organism, he anticipates \nthe future. It is then difficult to separate past, present, and future. \nPast, Present, and Future Interwoven. This view is not far re\xad\nmoved from modern thinking in physics which has gained fruitful in\xad\nsights by looking at the past, present, and future as interwoven \nrather than as sharply separated. Whether we like it or not and what\xad\never educational theory we develop, in actual fact, in a growing organ\xad\nism, what is done at any developmental stage ties in with the past and \nanticipates the future. Educators can then justifiably. ask questions \nconcerning the needs of the moment and the needs of the future. These \n", '\'"r THEORY OF GlliL!JHOOD EDUCATION . \' ,. \' \' - \\ \n. are also appropriate questions. for science, \'as each living thing as\'•it \nI -grows iqcludes fewer components that are subjectto cha,nge an\'d more \n. that are hot.: A child is a. more open system; an adult a more clo~ \' \nsystem. · 1 \'· • · \n.The\' prediction of the course ·of development .·presents important \nproblems.

It is de\',\n~ \n· sirable that the developing organism utilize the experiences of ··the \n\' moment in such a way that there will. be continuing progress. and per\xad\n. manent gains in level of functionhig. Of\' the variety of experiences \navailable ,at any moment, some are bad, some indifferent, and some \ngood from the long-time point of view. Skiil in guiding the child \nthrol]gh. this mass . of experience in a complex \'Society, with its· varied \nstimulation, demands insight and understanding on the part of the \nschool and. the teacher. \nEdiwation a Continuing Process. A traditional and naive concept \nconfines education to the walls of the scl;10olroom, limits it to the \n\'period from 9:00 A.¥. to 3:30 P.M. for niJe months each year, and \nbegins education with school entrance at six and ends it with gradua\xad\ntion from high school or college, some twelve or sixteen years later. \n. . , In re~ent years it has become clear that· educl).tion is not ·identical \n- "-\'ith for;nal schooling but is a life-long process that starts with birth \nand .continues until death. \n···Some ofthe child\'s most Hnportant learning occurs under the· guid\xad\nafice of relatively untrained parents\'before he enters school and·co~es· \n', "AND$RSON 73 \nunder the trained . teachers to whom society entrusts education. For · \nexample, many students of child development feel thatthe acquisition \n1 of the spoken language, which is accomplished mainly before five \nyears, is the child's greatest educational achievement. Whether or not \nthis holds, kindergarten, elementary, high-school, college, and adult \neducation are part of the process by which the cumulated experience \nof society is brought to the individual, who is at all age levels a \nlearning organism. Growth is a continuous process with progress by \nsmall increments; and it is separated into sharply differentiated edu\xad\nc.ational periods largely because of practical considerations. \nSociAL DEMANDS AND THE WISDOM oF THE BonY \nNot only does the child change with time but he also lives in an \nenvir(:m~ent that changes. The world and people about him move \nforward in time. Social institutions, problems, and relations change. \nUpon the educator falls some responsibility for _predicting the future \nof this social context, in order that he may prepare the child for what \nis to come. \n1 If his philosophy is that of meeting the needs of the moment, he \n·,has an easy out. Perhaps this explains the popularity of this doctrine \n-it avoids consideration alike of· the changes in the child and the \nchanges in the world about him. Much more difficult is an educatio:n,___:_ \n. grounded in present needs-that looks toward the future. \nWisdom of the Body. A current and attractive doctrine, expressed \nas the wisdom ofthe body, holds that the child will make the best \n,and wisest choices if let alone. Convincing demonstrations of the \nwisdom of individual choices can be made chiefly in the areas of food \nselection and sleep schedules. If, however, the c.onditions under which \nthese choices are made and the types of materials presented are ex\xad\namined, the assumption is clearly· not valid for all behavior and all \nsituations. In a free environment, with all types of adequate food avail\xad\nable, a young child who is permitted to choose his own food will secure \nan essentially balanced diet over a period of time. If, on the other \nhand, through negligence or otherwise, those who present the material \nfor choice leave out an essential ,dietary element, all children will \nautomatically have a deficiency. Under primitive conditions, in which \nthere is little external control and little danger, the body can be \nquite wise; in a modern city two-year-olds cannot choose to run on \nthe city streets. Nor' can free choice of drinking water be permitted, \nunless adults have made water available for choic~ that is pure and \nfree of contamination. Taste alone is a poor guide to the safety of \n", '74 \'l\'H. EO.RY oF CHILDHOOD EDudl~wN --· -- \'\'-\' \' ._ .. ,;"\' \nwata-.

The society in which the childllves arid that \ninto which he: is to go are structured. Both are • made up of various \nobjects and institutions; such as buildings, furniture, street cars, auto·. \nmobiles, machinery, equipment, skills, attitudes, rules, regulations, \nand limitations. The -~~~ of . the game are not formulated by tne \nchild-they are formuhited by groups and by society. Often-they are \nneither precisely nor explicitly formulated but are implicit otltGom~ \nof long·continued social processes, They do not change quickly.

In earlier daY.s education str~ssed the importance of fonfi~I· \nized and structured behavior. Modern education st~es~s. the develop· \nment of functions that enable the person to meet life· situations as \nthey occur rather than the precise content that meetf3 a partic).llar \nmomentary situation. This isthe i~portant distinction bet:ween what \nis learned as a specifieputcome and learning how to learn as-~. general \nprocess. \nTHE NATURE OF. THE .CHILD \nInsight into the nature of the child as he is. and is to be •underlies \nthe practical principles of early childhood education; In recent years \nhundreds of studies involving observations and experiments O:Jl e4i~\xad\ndren of all ages have been made. This vast and growing scientific \nliterature, with its many implications for education, V\'ery much needs \ninterpretation; it is a maj1or task even for a research specialist .to \nkeep up with it. Historically, ehil~ dev~lopment as a· \'Scientifi.c field \ncame into being as an attempt to cu:orninatetn\'e findiJ?.gS of different \nscientific fields relating to children, It is not a. single specialty parallel \n.. to psychology, sociology, anthropology, medicine, or psychiatry but \nan attempt to integrate these specialties. A~ a .result, it bec()mes the \narea of modern research most closely related to early childhood edu• \ncation. \n. . \n', "ANDERSON 75 \nIn contrast to the research worker, the teacher or supervisor is \nengaged in day-to-dayor rather minute-to-minute contacts with actual \n·· · children in real life situations. Her task involves much skill and \n' knowledge, some of which lies outside the generalizations of child \ndevelopment. Neither iit training nor in service does she have much \nopportunity to study this growing body of literature. Hence,·· a sep\xad\naration has appeared between research and practice. This is the traditional·\nseparation between a science and an art, which has always \nbeen difficult to bridge. \nThe problem of carrying over from what we know to what we do \nis not easy; in practice, it is complicated by the disagreements among \nresearch workers, not all of which are as great as they seem when \nbaldly and explicitly stated. Thus, the disagreements which center \nabout the relative roles of heredity and environment will probably \nnever be settled to the satisfaction of all. But both hereditarians and \nenvironmentalists agree on the desirability of a favorable environ.\nment for children. ·Both are interested in good schools; both are· con\xad\ncerned with good care. Although disagreeing on some points, both \nagree on most practical matters and details of procedure. \nThe Child is a Living System \nIn common with other living things, the child is a system in an \nenvironment. A living syf!tem maintains itself and interchanges con- ' \nstantly with the environment so long as life exists. Physically it \ntakes in food and converts it into energy; mentally it takes in stimu\xad\n'lation and converts it into behavior. The child is a polarizing center \n., into which things flow and out of which energy and behavior come. \nIn the early years, the rate of interchange is very great and, in relation \nto body size, intake and energy expenditure are greater. In later \nyears the rate is lower, since less is taken in and less expended. A \nhigh intake arid a high energy outgO characterize the human being; \nthrough them he has become much of what he is, \nIf this analysis is correct, and much evidence suppol'ts it, energy \nexpenditure is the child's most important ·attribute; The problem of \ntraining and teaching is not one of suppressing energy but one of \ndirecting it into desirable channels. Whether we like it or not, energy \n, is expended. Does it go outward into desirable or undesirable· chan\xad\nnels or inward to destroy the living system by indecision and con\xad\nflict? Once energy expenditure is accepted as normal, attention can \ngo to evaluating modes of energy expenditure in terms of U:ldividua) \nand group needs. For the teacher, education is guidance and direction; \n", '7() \n;t ~THEORY\n,OF CHILDH90P EDUdA\'P£0N \nJ \' \' \' ·-" \' • \nfor. the child, it is the unblocl\\il\'lg of energy expenditure i~ brdef . to \nutilize fully the resourcl(s within the f:lysteni. · 1 • \nThe Whole Child. As a living,system \'vvithin a single body, the \nchild is a unit. This wh~leness or ,unitary character is often forgotten \nin our zeal to develop specialties .and to advance knowledge· and \npractice. Often the specialist is more concerned with his specialty \nthan the person treated. A child becomes a pair of eyes to which \nglasses are being fitted, a hunger to be fed, or a calculating machine \ndoing arithmetic. , \nThe teacher is interested in teaching, the doctqr in medicine, the \nathletic coach .in motor performance. Each pushes his own demands \nwithout reference to others. To counteract this tendency, so marked in \n·~ modern tim·es, many of those interested in children emphasize the \nwhole child and seek a child-centered schooL Sometimes this phrase \n:is i~correctly interpreted in terms of an interest philosophy; actuaJJy \n\'what it means is that ·what is done in school should be evaluated in \nterms of its effects upon and V\\llues for the child· and not in terms of \nits contribution to outside agencies. or remote purposes. . \nIn the ideal school, specialists . consult with one another and bring \nwhatever knowledge is available to bear on the problems of any · \nchild. In contrast, in some schools the results. of physical examina\xad\ntions and of achievement and capacity tests ·given by appropriate \nspecialists \'are filed in a cabinet and never made accessible to the \nteachers and practical workers who might usq\' them to good effect. In \ngeneral, the more information is .made avaiiaole to those responsible \nforthe child\'s education and weifare, thebetter will be the practical \nf \'•\' .I \njob of child care, / .. \nSometimes, however, the concept oLthe whole child has been \nused to criticize the. research on children1 ··Research in its very. nature \' \ndeals v,"ith specific problems -that can be formulated. But as knowledge \nincreases, new ·specific techniques for envisaging pensonality and .• for. \nstudying- total factors develop. Great advances have been made in \'· \nstudying social behavior, the milnagerpent of children, and the effects \nof social atmosphere by envisaging the child as .a whole. · \nBalaneed Growth. Modern education assumes that the child should \nmove forward in parallel and sorn~what equivalen~ steps in anatomica1l, \nphysical, physiological,· mental, a.nd social growth. When one area of \ngrowth is greatly retarded or accelerated to the exclusion of the oth!:lrs, \nharm may be the res1,1lt. It is.the responsibility of the teacher and the \nschool to further such balanced development. Sometimes the school \nproduces distortion by overernp4a~izing some ESubjects to the e"clusion · \n', 'ANDERSON 77 \nof others or by making very sharp separations betw~en them. While \nsome separation is inevita.ble and desirable, the question of balance in \ngrowth is important: How can the child\'s experience be so organized \nand arranged that he will move forward at a good rate without dis\xad\ntortion, blocking, or unevenness? How can his experiences be inte\xad\ngrated or tied together so as to preserve his essential wholesomeness \nthrough his many different activities? How can the school, home, \nand ~ommunity be brought into" relationship to one another to pro\xad\nvide the optimal environment for good development? \nIn early childhood education much emphasis is placed upon whole\xad\nsome and balanced grbwth. The nursery school not only has brought \ndifferent specialists· and ·agencies into effective relationship with ·one \nanother but, within its own program, has also attempted to corre\xad\nlate and integrate the various influences \'to which the child is ex"\' \nposed. It is perhaps more successful in these attempts than are the \nschools for older children, because the younger child is much more \nof a unity with closer relations within and between "the parts of which \nhe is made, while the older child is more specialized with. more sep\xad\naration between parts. But at all age levels, integration should be \nem\'phasized. \nThe Young Child Is Positively Oriented \nThe young .child is an active, searching, curious, manipulative\\ \ncreature positively oriented to the stimulation.in his environment. The \nyoung child not only seeks stimulation but, when stimulated, seeks \nstill more. He reacts negatively to very few objects. Ed.ucation\xad\nin fact, life experience--takes this active, searching, manipulative, \\ \nand curious creature and builds into him organized, structured, and set . \np·atterns of habits, skills, interest, and attitude. The child has a wide · .. \nrange of interests, the adolescent has fewer, and the adult still fewer. \nBut the adolescent and the adult follow their interests more efficiently \nand meet life demands better. In the developmental process efficiency \nis acquired at the cost of versatility. The child is changed from a \nmultipotential creature that can go in an endless number of directions \nto one with a. particular or a few directions. \nLife builds upon what the child already has. The early period \nis one of searching out and exploring the environment and ,one\'s self \nin order to establish the base upon which development will take \nplace.\' The broader the base and the more varied the child\'s experience,. \nthe better is the chance that he will~ find himself and discover the \n, possibilities of his environment, and the greater the likelihood of good \n', '78 THEORY OF ClJILDHCYOD EDUCATION \nJ - \'> I \' • • \nbehavior and, personalhappineas1ater. lf the child cannot discover \n· :whathe,can do or what· opportunities !::lis environment affords, hifl .. de\xad\n. velopmental possibilties are restricted or limited. Ea.r~y childhood \n··" education is then con.ceived ·in te:rms of br:oad and varied experience \nwith many opportunti(ls for self-discovery. \n·/ Errors. and Outgrown Responses .. , In studies of infants ·and ydung \nchil~ren evidence abounds that many elements appear in early be\xad\nhavior sequences. Some become permanent parts of behavior with\xad\nout much change; some are substantially modified and changed; s~me \ndisappear completely. The young }ruman being< makes many errors, \n/does oyer and over again, and bungles and feels hi~ way about. He \n·• is highly motivated when little or .np constraint is imposed on his \nsearching, curious, and manipulafive behavior. Much of this behavior \nis not meaningless. Neither are his . bungling attempts and errors \nmistakes; they are part of· the learning process. He learns through his \n. errors and his successes. Out of this explorato~ and unorganized \n, behavior the child weaves the pattern of his ljfe. An educational en1\nvironment for young children should,, therefore, provide for breadth \n\' of experience and manifold opportu:t;J.ities ·for· exploration . rather th:;m \nconsist of a few limited, definitely structured, and highly selected \n\\ experiences. Many experiences, apparently valueless in terms of the \n· ~\'moment, are of great value .for subsequent ·development, \nThe Young Child\'s Behavior Is Fluid \nA somewhat related and equally fundamental characteristic of \n.• t!J.e young child appears as a resulf of m:odern studies. It can best be \nthought of in terms of fluid behavior and applies not so much to the \nvariety of responses as to their organization. It is a common .ex\xad\nperience that a person skilled in exailiining or teaching adolescents \nbase difficulties when he first examines or teaches young children. \nHe has· been accustomed to giving directions and securing prompt \nresponses and to asking questions and \'getting answers back; in other \nwords, he is accustomed to responses that are closely adapted to \nthe situation. With· the young .. child, however, • the examin~r. or teacher; \nwho is too quick on the trigger; too demanding, and too wecise will: \nbe· resisted. The answer for. which he may have to wait wilL appear; \ncasually in the ·midst of apparently unrelated material.. Logicality \nand precision. are characteristic of mature. forms of thinking. The dOC-\'; \ntor can proceed quickly with an examination of an .older child because. \nthe child knows. what to expect and what to ·dO. With a young child, . \nhowever, he must wait, let the child wander· around the room and be-\n', "ANDERSON 79 \ncome accustomed to the place. The young child is essentially un\xad\nstructured. In studies of babies some· difficulty is found in securing \noonsistent responses from week to week, even though every attempt is \nmade to set up the same situations. One week the babies respond, the \nnext week they do not, and the next, perhaps, they d.o. Later oQ, they \nrespond consistently. The experimenter has to wait on the babies in\xad\nstead of . forcing the baby into the experimenter's framework. \nPace Set by Child. Therefore, the principle emerges of permitting· \nthe young child to set the pace, of waiting for the child. to adapt, and \nof not expecting too precise or exact behavior. An important .. area \nfor study, with many implications for practice, is opened up. If the \nchild is fluid, unstructured, unorganized, and undifferentiated in many \nbehavior areas, it is essential that adult attitudes, values, and inter-· \npretations be not projected into child behavior. Adults fail to see how \ncompletely organized, structured, and precise much of their behavior \nis and how little room there is for modification. Workers with chil\xad\ndren need to be warned that the child is fluid, has a short attention \nspan and a short memory span, is not able to·work for remote goals, \nand is concerned very much with present stimulation. He is different \nin the sense of being fluid and responsive rather than ·fixed and chan\xad\nnelized. \nFlexible Program. An educational program appropriate for young \nchildren must, therefore, be adapted to their nature, in that it must \nnot be too highly fixed, too patterned, too organized, too demanding, \nor too constraining. There should be patience to permit the child to \nfind his way; and there must be confidence in the child's ability to \nstructure his own behavior and to attain the organization necessary \nfor adjustment. The younger the child, the more he is ·a creature of \nmomentary needs; the more definitely he responds in terms of im\xad\npulse, the more suggestible and at the same time the more resistive \nhe is to stimulation that. does not conform with or meet the pattern \nof the moment. In brin.ging the child by degrees from informal to \nformal activities, we must see that the possibilities of fluid behavior \nare not arbitrarily restricted, since such limits reduce the possibilities \nof future organization. \n· Shall the Schedule Dominate? Should the program for young \nchildren be set up in a routine way with a fixed schedule of organized \nactivities carried on in a very definite fashion? Or shall it be highly \nindividualized, flexible, and 1'closely related to the needs of children \nat the moment? In the :first case there should be a fixed schedule with \na programof specific activities designed for all children. Primary exn.-\n", "80 THEORY 1 ()F CIU4DHOOJ) EDUCATION \n, phasis would be placed on 1 getting the group of chilc!.ren through the \nactivities. In the second case, the nursery. school :or kindergarten \nwould operate without an obvious program or curriculum, even though \nli!Ubstantial planning had been done. Its activities. from day to day \nand from mom~nt tb moment would·· seem to be spontaneous and . ' ' ' \nflexible, :with almo~t ·complete freedom for· the indivi~ual. The teach~ \ner's tasks ate making ,materials and experiences available and giving \nchildren opportuniti()s to. choose freely froni them, in'stead of rushing \nthe group through a predetermined program. In many schools and \nclassrooms the· schedule dominates the thinking of ~the teacher and \nchildren, with the result.that children's needs are ignored. The aim of \nscheduling is not the maintenance of a schedule nor the convenience \n~' ·'· \\ \nof the teacher, as some suppose. It seeks to provide brderly and systematic\nways of expending energy. Tll() young c~ild h!:1_slittJe need for \norderliness; the adult who lives in a practical world of space and \ntimeliis much need of it. Adult living, especially effective work, is \npartly a matter of maintaining schedules. The child needs experience \nwith schedules as well as with freedom. The practical problem centers \non the relative amounts of free and controlled experience to be given \nat each age level in order to further development. Viewed in this way, \n~acting and structured requirements may well inqrease with age. \nThus, with young children there should be more flexibility and a wider \nrange of opportunity; with olde~ children, less flexibility and more \norganization. \nThe Young Child'S: World Is Concrete anq T,angible \nThe studies of Piaget and his follpwers on the .. development of \nthinking show that young children think in COn9J'ete rather than ab\xad\nstract terms and that their thought js · closely ·connected with the \ni object or situation in which thought arises. Associations are made \non the basis of immediat~ experience rather than, through logical \npr causal relations.! With growth, particularly in adolescence, thereis \nan increase in the capacity to use abstract terms, to ;'work with sym\xad\nbols when the objects of thought are re:rnote, and to make logical \nand causal associations. The adult uses abstract ahd .general con\xad\ncepts and substitutes symbols for overt, behavior whenever he can. \nBecause of their unfamiliarity with these .age changes and their ~a\xad\nmiliarity. with their own thought processes, adults 1 expect children \nto think as adults. Teachers are adults and think llke adults, while \nthe children they teach are at a more primitive and; child~like level. \nSpecial efforts are needed ,in the training of teachers to counteract \n'! \n", "ANDERSON 81 \nand overcome the dominance of adult modes of thought by showing \nthem how to use concrete, specific, aJ;J.d tangible materials rather than \nverbal, symholic, and abstract materials. \nFor young children the actual manipulation of objects with their,, \nown hands is of much greater value than the manipulation of the · \nsymbols which represent them. This is true, in some degree, of the \nolder child. It is much easier for the teacher or adult to rattle off \nsymbols glibly than to use specific examples, concrete materials, and \nreal life situations. Not only should the teacher understand the value \nof doing, experiencing, and manipulating objects but the school for \nyoung children should also be equipped with a wide variety of ma\xad\nterials and should offer many kinds of stimulating experiences in \norder to give the good efforts of the teacher an opportunity to be \nrevealed. But the education of the young child should not stop with \n·concrete materials and primitive modes of thoug;ht. He is also inter\xad\nes~ed in language, wants to play with it, and is acquiring facility with \nsymbols and abstractions. In a good environment'the young child is \nlinguistically active much of the time. Language and thought develop \nin an atmosphere in which, in addition to tangible experiences, manipu~' \nlation of objects, and doing for himself, the child is free to talk abou~ \nhis experiences, to describe them to others, and to indulge in verbal \nplay and symbolic manipulation. \nThe Young Child Depends on Incentives \nIt has been pointed out that the young child seeks more and more \nstimulation from his environment. New objects attract him, new \nsensory experiences pull him. In managing young children, teachers \nand parents utilize external objects and incentives to motivate him. \nIt has been said that the young child is a creature of the moment. \nThis means that his interests are fleeting and that continuous and \nconsistent stimulation is necessary if he is to be kept at a task or to \ncarry through to a goal. Here the question as to whether it is de\xad\nsirable that he be,kept at a task or be required to carry through to \na goal is not asked i our immediate concern is with his nature. As age \nincreases, the ability to work for longer periods of time, to think of \nremote goals, and to carry through to a purpose with extended satis\xad\nfaction increases. Extrinsic motivation is replaced by intrinsic moti\xad\nvation, which is less. dependent upon accident or circumstance. The \nyoung child is more pulled about by his environment, whereas the \nolder child is more aware of his own needs and purposes. \nA program for educating young children should make a beginnin~ \n", "82 THJJORY OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \nin ~eveloping the child's capacity to do for himself and in creating \na W'illi!igness and de§ire to P~~rsist to a solution or goal. To accomplish \nthis the child should have ·opportunities to follow his own purposes \nand to experience, their def?irable and undesirable outcomes. Some\xad\nthing is known of the types of environment that produce persistence \nin five-year-olds. Those with high pers1stence come from homes with \nmoderate disciplinary programs, while those with low perSistence \ncome from homes that are 'either very easygoing or very rigid. Doing \ntoo much for the child results in behavior similar to that whidh comes \nfrom doing too little. In between there is a relation between adults \nand children which uses incentives, not f.or their own sake or for adult \n·. convenience but primarily to build the self-control that will enable \nthe chjld to work out his own inner needs and interests in socially \n· _ •. ~ desirable ways. What is meant is not so much a specific product or a \nparticular accomplishment as an atmosphere that carries the child \nforwal'd in his capacity to do for himself and others without under\xad\ncutting initiative. and spontaneity. Two methods of motivation are \ncontrasted, one of which forces the child into a framework of action \nby external pressure; the other of which, by developing inner needs \nand interests, makes of the child a self-propelling vehicle. Although \nboth are interwoven in many activities; one is gradually substituted \n\\ for the other.. Extrinsic motivation is easier to use, can be developed \nmore uncritically; and gives an appearance of order. Intrinsic moti\xad\nvation is more difficult to develop and needs rriore sensitivity and skill \non the part {)f the teacher. Although intrinsic motivation sometimes \n)··' does not produce clean-cut and obvious results, in the long n.p1 the \ngains in development and power more th;an make up for the difficulties \nin its development. \nThe Young Child Is Emotionally Stable if His World Is Secure \nIn early childhood, in order to learn well, the child needs con• \nfidenee in his environment and security in his relations with others. \nIn later childhood and adolescence, confidence in the environment \nis transformed into confidence in one's se~f in order to meet the stresses \nand strains of adult life. Confidence and security arise in an environ,\nment with some stability. When the. child is handled inconsistently \n· from moment.to moment and day to day, he must adjust not. only to \n,new elementsbut alsqto variable changes in their relations. Young chi! .. \ndren in England who were evacuated in the early days of the war \n·showed much tenseness and urihappines!! until a familiar type of play \n. equipment was seen.· With recognition of the familiar and.stable, they \n", 'ANDERSON 83 \ncalmed down and adjusted well. The familiar, whether in materials \no.r in schedule, provides an anchor from which the child oan move on \ninto the unexplored and the new.· \nA good environment contains stable features and consistent pat\xad\nterns which can be recognized as such by the child. It also gives \nfreedom to do and to explore the new. By balan.cing familiar elements \nand customary experiences with unfamiliar and new elements, transi\xad\ntions are facilitated, and progress is made possible. When neurotic \npersons care for young children, difficulties arise, not so much out of \nthe specific things they do as out of the inconsistencies in what they \ndo which keep the child constantly out of balance. Sometimes a strict \nenvironment, whi-ch is consistent, gives the child more security than \nan easy environment that is"Inconsisten,t. The child needs confidence \nin the teacher but should nothe dependent upon her. Much of the \nskill of ft good teacher centers in her ability to build up feelings of \nconfidenc~ in children, without making them dependent. In a stable \nand emotionally balanceden:;l.~onment, self-expression, creative efforts, \nand learning are facilitated. \nThe Young Child Needs Much Social Experience \nThe child is positively oriented toward his environment and seeks \nmore and more stimulation from it. In this environment the most im-.r \nportant objects are other persons. The child is more interested in them \nthan in any other objects because they minister. to his wants and \noffer a changihg pattern of color, light, shadow, sound, and movement \nwhich, in itself, holds the child. Moreover, in the world of the future, \nmuch of his happiness and effectiveness will depend on the manner \nin which he reacts to others and in which they, in turn, react to him. \nHe adjusts to others, first in face-to-face, then in group, and, later, \nin more remote contacts. \nAlthough the prime importance of social adjustment is well recog\xad\nnized, what is not so well known is the tremendous advances made \nin the early years under appropriate opportunities. There. is great \nvariation in the number, variety, and types of social experience in \nchildhood. The actual counting of ·social contacts made by children .. \nindicates that these contacts run· into· tba hundreds for each day \nof observation. lf these figures are multiplied by appropriate num\xad\nbers for days, weeks, II_lOnths, and years, it becomes clear that SOCial \nbehavior is made up of many skills which are neither momentarily \nevolved nor derived f:rom unvarying pattel,\'lls coming down through \nheredity. They are the outcomes of learning in situations which recur \n', "84 THEORY OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \ncountless times and which are subject to guidance. It has been shown \nthat much of the social i:n~ectiveness of older children is the result \nof ignorance and inexperience rather than of inherited tendencies, \nwilful behavior, or lack of sociality. By appropriate training .in skills \nthat give social visibility and experience in guiding others, children \nwho are submissive, outcasts, or nonparticipants can acquire new \nsocial behavior that will change their roles in the group. The social \npatterns which are established early are stable and affect later behavior.·\n' \nQuantity of Socfal Experience. From such observations it is clear \nthat in any program of education for young children substantial ac\xad\ncount must be taken of the children's needs for sq_gial experience and \nof. the values which come directly from appropriate and guided social \nexperience' in quantity. Even though the group structures and the \nsocial interrelations among young children may seem quite ephemeral \nto the naive observer, they are, nevertheless, the base from which. \nsubsequent social development moves. \nA good school for young children recognizes tlle primacy 6f social \nexperience and seeks to give children a variety of contacts with other \nchildren in face-to-face and small-group relations, varying all the \nway from the informal and spontaneous groupings that characterize \nthe free play period to the formal and guided group expi'Jriences which \nare somewhat similar to but do not duplicate those which the child \nwill have .later in the elementary school. \nQuality of Sociql Contacts. Such a school is concerned not only \nwith the provision of a wide variety of social experiences in order to \nfacilitate the development of social behavior but is also concerned \nwith the quality of contacts which are made. It is easy, for instance, \nto set up a highly competitive atmosphere in whichjndividual children \nvie with each other for the teacher's attention and for places in the \nsun. It is somewhat more difficult to set up. an atmosphere which \nemphasizes co-operative and sharing behavior by teaching the chil\xad\ndren to take turns, by helping them to work together with common \ntoys, or by encouraging them to share their possessions and experi·'\nences with one another. Evidence indicates that competitive and co\xad\noperative behavior parallel each other in development and are posi\xad\n. tively correlated. They are to be looked upon as differentiations \nfrom the more primitive group behavior. · \nImportance of Space and Equipment. To establish a good social \nenvironment for young children, some emphasis needs to be placed \nupon adequate outdoor and indoor play equipment and space. The \n", 'ANDERSON 85 \nchild needs space, outdoor life, and play experience with other children \nin an environment that is not too confining or too restricted. Where \nthe space is too limited or where there is little or no equipment and \nfew materials, the quality of social responses deteriorates. \nTHE AcQUISITION oF SKiLL \nAs the child grows, he faces one situation after another in which \nhe must build new modes of behavior. Sometimes the demands upon \nhim arise out of his own impulses; more often they grow out of living \ntogether, i.e., are social in nature. In its early stages adjustment con\xad\nsists of a relatively unorganized and unstructured approach to the \nsituation. In its final stages it consists of responses which are \norganized and structured into a pattern. The process of acquiring this \npattern is called learning, and what is left behind in the child as a •. \nfairly permanent way of meeting the situation is known as a skiU: \' \nThus, the young child meeting the. situation-shoes with laces-goes \nthrough much manipulation and unorganized" and ineffective move\xad\nment. If he per:sists and tries over .a period of time, he learns to lace \nhis shoes. What previously took many minutes of fmilbling and ap., \nparently useless effort. now takes but a moment of time· and is done \nsmoothly and expertly. Fromiacqtiiring control over eliminative proc\xad\nesses, dressing, and eating situations, the .child moves on to acquiring \nskill in reading, in numbers, and i\' social behavior. Literally, hundreds \nof skills go to m~J,ke up the complex adjustment of an adult in our. \nsociety. During the whole of development, the human is engaged in. \nacquiring skill and competence in many areas an.d under many dif\xad\nferent circumstances. In some areas only a few days or weeks are \ninvolved; in others, months; and in others, years. In some areas \nlearning or adjustment is never complete, no m.atter how long one \nlives. What, then, does the person gain by the acquisition of skill \nin terms of the situation or problem? • \nSkill and Freedom. · Skill frees the person from the dominance or,. \nthe situation and enables him to move on to other areas. Thus, the \nyoung child who can lace his shoes is freer than the child who cannot \nlace them. What takes him a minute takes the other ten ur fifteen \nminutes. The skilled child has time for other aJ+d more desirable \nactivities. The child who comes to school without knowing how to \nput on his overcoat or overshoes tpust be taught these skills by a busy. \nteacher at the expense of some other and better kindergarten activities. \nIndividuals are made free, not by following every impulse ot doing \nas they will but by becoming competent in the areas of living which \nare about them. It is the task of the educator to outline and plan \n', '86 THEORY OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \nthe orderly acquisition of skills in order that the child may move on \nfrom lower to higher levels of behavior. \nThe Restricted or Bound Child. What happens if the child does \nnot acquire competence in a particular area at an appropriate time in \nthe developmental sequence? "Appropriate time" may be defined as \nthat at which other children acquire competence or the environment \ndemands such competence. Consider the child of two and a half or \nthree years of age who has not learned to control his eliminative \nhabits. The child with control can forget the whole process, since he· \nis not unusual or striking in tenus of his group and is not bothered \nby the situations connected with elimination. The child who has not \nacquired competence is a marked child among his mates (who may be \nfamiliar with his lack of control), among his teachers, with his parents, \nand with the physician who may be consulted about the problem. \nPsychologically, he lives in a different world; it is a world in which \nhis inadequacy is more or less always present and is a source of \ncomment, discussion, and differential treatment, perhaps even ridicule \nand social displeasure. Similarly, one can point out that the child \nwho quickly and easily acquires skill in reading in the first or second \ngrade can move on without embarrassment, whereas the child who is \nineffective suffers more or less constant embarrassment. His world \nis different. because others react differently to him. In time, his rela\xad\ntion to his environment is 11adically different frorn that of his asso\xad\nciates. The child who fails to acquire skills or habits or to respond \nto the demands made upon him is a bound individual in comparison \nwith \'the one who, because he has acquired competence, is freer, less \nconstrained, and more open. The teacher is interested in unblocking \nand unbinding the child, thus opening new vistas for him. \nMATURATION AND LEARNING \nBecause he is a growing organism responding to primary life im\xad\npulses, the child will move forward in some degree, regardless of \nstimulation. In some environments progress will be slower; in others, \nfaster. For practical purposes the distinction between those phases \nof adjustment which depend upon growth and maturing and those \nwhich depend upon experience or learning is important. Between \nthese extremes is a whole continuum in which both maturation and \nlearning operate in different proportions and degrees. The separation \nof what is learned fro:tn what matures has been attacked in a variety \nof ways by investigators who have found· a relation between the com\xad\nplexity of the activity to be acquired and the effect of learning. In \n', 'ANDERSON 87 \nmany simple skills and ordinary activities the child with specific \ntraining does only a little better, if at all, than the child who has not \nreceived any training. With complex skills, on the other hand, guided \ntraining results in enormous differences between the children with and \nthose without training. The practical principles involve: ( 1) the \nrecognition of the child\'s level when instruction begins; (2) the pro\xad\nvision of preparatory material to facilitate leaming; and (3) instruc\xad\ntion, stiiimlation, and guidance in the skills or knowledge to be ac\xad\nquired. \nReadiness. At some levels of development and e~pcrience the child \nis better prepared to acquire a skill than at other levels. The term \n"readiness" expresses this quality. Readiness to read means being \nprepared to learn to read. The factors behind readiness are found to \ninvolve some degree of maturity or growth and some particular types \nof experience. Thus, the child is not ready to read until he has some \nfacility in the spoken language. 1 fair mastery of speech symbols \nmust be attained before the child can be interested in the visual sym\xad\nbols necessary to readingo \nBut learning to read is facilitated if the child has had particular \nkinds of experience. If the material to be read tells about cows, milk, \nand the farm, the child will make more rapid progress if, prior to in\xad\nstruction, he is familiar with the objects described. A rural child \nwould have this familiarity as a matter of course, while a child in a \nlarge city might neve~ have seen a cow or know how milk comes to be \non the table. The rural child might know nothing about elevators or \nsubways. Prior to reading instruction a good teacher organizes ex\xad\nperiences so as to give the child familiarity with the vvords and con\xad\ncepts used in reading. This can be done by group discussions, ex\xad\ncursions, exhibits, and guided play activities. Many of the skills which \nthe child needs in our complex society are themselves complex and \ndepend on a variety of background material. Readiness, then, involves \nboth maturation and experience. To handle the child effectively his \nlevel should be known. Insight into future education and the inclusion \nof "readiness" material for that future are important for those who \ndeal with younger children. \nThe study of readiness gives excellent examples of the need and \nimportance of the integration of the educational program along vertical \nlines and thus illustrates the principle of time binding which was dis\xad\ncussed earlier, i.e., the relation between past, present, and future. If \nwe knew more about children over longer periods of time, it would \nbecome clear that there are areas in which one type of material or \n', '88 THEORY OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \nexperience definitely facilitates the acquisition or progress in a later \nand different type of experience. These would contribute not only to \nskill and knowledge but also to the child\'s confidence and personality. \nGroupings l:ry Age Level.s. In some nursery schools and kinder\xad\ngartens children are sharply divided into two-year-old, three-year-old, \nfour-year-old, and five-year-old groups, with a pattern of school \norganization that duplicates the traditional age pattern followed in \nmost elementary schools. Whether or not this is desirable has not been \nexperimentally determined. There is, however, much criticism of the \nelementary school for its rigid age classifications and some emphasis \nin modern thought upon the desirability of having children spread their \nacquaintanceship and social experience over a wide rather than a \nnarrow age range. Such contacts would also motivate younger chil\xad\ndren toward the skills and attitudes of the older children and facilitate \ntheir vertical progress. A good practice would be to arrange situations \nin which two-, three-, four-, and five~year-old ,children can mingle, \nplay, and work with one another, in addition to providing group ex\xad\nperience within a narrow age range. \nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ExPERIENCES FOR CHILDREN \nTwo major problems are faced by every person who undertakes \nto lay out a program for the education of children. One is the problem \nof what; the other is the problem of when. The first is the problem \nof content; the second is that of the sequence or location of content \nwithin the developmental process. In addition, there is the problem \nof how, which cannot be completely dissociated from what and when, \nsince within limits there is some variation in location with method; \nThe answers to all three questions depend upon the level of matura\xad\ntion of the child and his readiness or previous experience. Children \ndo with difficulty at an earlier age what they do with ease at a later \nage, when their level of maturity and background of experience are \ngreater. Thus, older children can solve problems that are much too \ndifficult for younger children, simply because they are older. Children \nof the same age solve problems of differing difficulty because of their \nexperience. \nIn a favorable environment preschool children who show marked \ninterest in numbers enjoy playing with numbers and with number \ngames. This interest, which can be encouraged, creates spontaneous \npractice that, later, makes arithmetic much easier. Clinics find that \nchildren who have much difficulty in numbers will eagerly play such \ngames as "Rummy," which gives painless pra.ctice in number combi-\n', 'ANDERSON 89 \nnations. Such a prescription meets a deficiency in number experience \nwhich should not have arisen. ·When lack of experience is viewed as a \ndeficiency in early education, the pattern of education emerges as a \nproblem. When, and how, and to what degree shall this, that, or the \nother be made a part of the child\'s experience? \nIf we were willing to spend the money and to provide a very high \ntype of individual instmction, much of what is now taught children \ncould be taught as well or better at earlier ages. McGraw was amaz\xad\ningly successful in teaching .Johnny complex motor skills before the \nage of eighteen months, Others have reported on early reading, mathe\xad\nmatical, artistic, and musical skills in individual children. Such \nteaching is not only very expensive but it may also be quite undesir\xad\nable in terms of the balanced growth of the cbild. Is the greater energy \nand time that is required on the part of the child and teacher neces\xad\nsary, in view of the fact that a few months or years later equivalent \nmastery can be acquired with less time and energy? These are im\xad\nportant problems, to many of which there are, as yet, no precise \nanswers. \nIn the meantime environments have to be set up for young children \nin terms of the best knowledge available. These will consist of par\xad\nticular experiences and opportunities arranged in some order or pat\xad\ntern. \nThe Curriculum as a Series of Guided Exper·iences. In the educa\xad\ntion of children, the concern is not only with single skills and ex\xad\nperiences but also with the general patterns of responses and attitudes \nto be acquired over a period of time. Since everything cannot be made \navailable at one time, choices have to b€ made, both, of the experiences \nto be had and of the emphasis each is to be given. A pattern of op\xad\nportunities and guided experiences is known as a curriculum. The \ncurriculum-maker faces a difficult task. ln spite of the best intentions, \nhe must break up what he wishes children to have into small segments, \nwhich, being misinterpreted by teachers, soon acquire hard and fast \nboundaries and lose their flexibility and relation to children\'s needs. \nFor curriculum-planning, the child\'s past experience, present needs, \nand future possibilities need consideration. \nUnits of Experience for Young Children. In discussions of the cur\xad\nriculum for older children, such terms as "projects" and "units" are \nused. Because they imply too much standardization and formal organi\xad\nzation, they do not apply very well to the program for younger chil\xad\ndren. Better terms would be· "experiences" or "guided experiences." \nBut, in using them, care is to be tak(m not to think of unplanned or \n', '90 THEORY OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \naccidental experiences. A project that seems very informal to the \nchild may be the result of more definite planning and more conscious \nguidan~ on the part of the teacher than is one which seems highly \nformal and fixed. Some teachers are themselves so highly structured \nthat they operate in a purely routine "nickel in the slot" way without \nplanning or thinking. A good teacher maintains the appearance of in\xad\nformality in order to secure interest and motivation from her children. \nBut she plans the material or experiences to be presented and gives \nserious consideration in advance to the methods of interesting the \nchild and of eliciting his spontaneous enthusiasms. \nThe young child, with his short memory and attention spans, shifts \ninterests quickly. As he grows older he develops the ability to work \nfor longer periods, to seek more remote goals, and to relate present \nbehavior to future goals. From the elementary grades through high \nschool to college, content is integrated into larger and larger units with \ngreater dominance by remote goals. A substantial contribution to be \nmade by the school is the development of orderly and systemat-ic work \nhabits that make the attainment of remote goals possible. \nMoreover, the number of children who can co-operate or work to\xad\ngether in a particular unit or project increases with age. Groups of \nfrom four to six children are maintained spontaneously by four-year\xad\nold children, while two-year-olds typically are found in groups of two \nor three. By appropriate group experience the attention span of the \nchild can be enlarged to enable him to maintain more effective rela\xad\ntions with larger numbers of people and a greater range of material. \nThe experiences provided for two- or three-year-olds should last \nfor a short time and be very concrete and tangible. Activities should \nbe many and should change frequently. For four-year-olds somewhat \nlonger projects and more involved units can be developed, some of \nwhich may carry over from one day to the next. At the kindergarten \nlevel, a transition can be made to activities that can be carried over \na week or ten days and still maintain the interest and wholehearted \nco-operation of children. In the elementary school the child works \nfor longer periods of time at activities which, however interesting they \nmay be, are of remote value in terms of their immediate contribution \nto personality. Later, insight may come. Thus, a child of nine, who \nsuddenly discovered that she could read through a whole book and \nkeep it in mind, was both surprised and pleased at discovering this \nability. This gradual lengthening of time, this increasing complexity \nand holding power of a project which has goal characteristics, is an \nimportant educational eontribution. \n', "ANDERSON 91 \nAdults often fail to realize the extent to which their established \nhabits and fixed modes of work Hre the products of their own age and \nexperience. As a result, their expectancies in. terms of educational \ncontent are often far too high for young children. The imposition of \nthe teacher's goals and adult work structures may be very harmful \nto the child at a time when he cannot really earry through. It is a \ncommon error to expect far too much in terms of persistence, order\xad\nliness, and accomplishment from young children. Some teachers are \nmuch more interested in the perfection of the product (an adult struc\xad\nture) than in the process of learning. On the other hand, those with \nexperience are constantly surprised at how well young children can \nfunction. The experienced and intelligent teacher learns to know what \nto expect, not in terms of what adults do but in terms of children's \npossibilities. \nContent Should Be De-emphasized. Any discussion of units of ex\xad\nperience may seem to place too mueh stress upon eontent because of \nan adult tendency to think in terms of aceomplishments. Ideally, with \nyoung children, content should be minimized, and stress should be \nplaced on adjustment and modes of attack on problems. It is not \nwhat the child learns in formal terms which is important but what \nhe gains from experiences in the way of self-control, emotional bal\xad\nance, initiative, interest, and enthusiasm for the material in question. \nAnticipation of Futu1·e Experiences. The vertical integration of \neontent presents a practical problem in curriculum-planning and in \nteaching. To what extent shall future experiences be anticipated and \nwork for readiness be placed in the lower grades to prepare for the \nupper grades.? Criticism has been made of nursery sehools in that they \nmake children unhappy in kindergarten by anticipating their ex\xad\nper,iences and of kindergartens in that they do too much for children \nwho enter first grade. These are not so much criticisms of nursery \nand kindergarten education as indications of failure in co-ordinating \nprograms at various levels. They may also indicate lack of teaching \nskill or vision in utilizing the experience and capacities of children for \neducational purposes and in providing interesting new experiences for \nthem. They are more apt to arise in a formalized educational system \nand less likely to appear if teachers are trained to adapt programs \nto children's needs. \nOverstimulation,. Another criticism-that young children are over\xad\nstimulated by nursery-school and kindergarten experiences-also indi\xad\ncates poor program-planning and lack of. teaching skill. Although it \nmay occur in an individual child, it should not happen for a room or \n", "92 THEORY OF' CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \na school. This criticism often arises out of a misunderstanding of the \nyoung child's nature. He is not, as some suppose, a physical being \nmerely waiting to grow but an active, energetic, and alert person. \nSome home environments are not stimulating enough for young chil\xad\ndren, who can often do very much more than they actually do or are \nexpected to do. A program well adapted to children's needs results in \ngrowth and development but not in overstimulation. \nTHE RoLE OF THE TEACHER \nFor the young child the school is a significant part of bis world. \nIn it are equipment, materials, other children, and a teacher. The \nteacher is the most important single object in this environment. About \nher the school revolves. She sets the stage and disposes of the players, \nshe creates and maintains the atmosphere in which the work and \nplay of the children takes place. Much of what goes on in and out \nof her schoolroom depends upon her conception of what teaching is, \nwhat children are, and what learning is. \nLearning i._~ Self-education. If a child is given a problem which \ncan be solved and if he is motivated to respond, correct responses \nwill appear, in time, rega.rdless of whether or not a teacher is present \n_or instruction is given. All that is essential is that right and wrong \nresponses have different outcomes. If guidance and demonstration of \ngood procedures are added, the child will make greater progress. \nLiterally then, a teacher does not teach; she guides a process inherent \nin the child which could go on even if she were not present but which \nshould go on more effectively if she is present. She motivates the \nchild in a process of self-education. The child learns through his own \nerrors, which are part of the early stages of learning, Therefore, he \nmust have opportunities to make errors in order to profit from them. \nThe teacher sets up the conditions which motivate the child, i.e., the \nconditions which start the restructuring of behavior, and then moves \non to facilitate the restructuring in every way possible. It should be \nclear to her that restructuring is an internal rather than an external \nprocess and that it. involves grmv'ih and development. \nIn these terms, a school for young children is a stimulating en\xad\nvironment in which appropriate materials and persons are made avail\xad\nable to children who are motivated toward them in order that learn\xad\ning may take place. Emphasis is upon adjustment in a broad sense. In \nsome areas, this means mastering specific motor, linguistic, and intel\xad\nlectual skills for present or later utilization; in other areas it means \nease and skill in meeting and working with others; in still other areas \n", 'ANDERSON 93 \nit means emotional balance and self-control. Within the program there \nare few m·usts and few attempts to force the child for any limited, \ntemporary, or narrow purpose. But a double set of general purposes \n-one .of which is gradual adaptation of the individual to group living \nand societal demands, the other of which is the exploration and stimu\xad\nlation of the child\'s own capacities in an environment in which he \nfeels secure and free to go about his own development-must be kept \nin mind. \nIndividual Abilities a.nd Guidance. Practical experience and scien\xad\ntific research alike show wide differences between children in their \nspecific abilities and in the pattern of their abilities. These differences \nare increased by training and experience. In educating the child, ac\xad\ncount must be taken both of his present traits and attainment levels \nand of his future possibilities. Some aspects of the child~s personality \ncan be greatly modified and others can be changed only to a limited \ndegree. A skilful teacher seeks to equalize the opportunities for chil\xad\ndren-not by setting a dead level of uniformity for all but by special \nefforts and devices to interest each child and to encourage him t<l \nutilize his own capacities and the school opportunities to the full. \nShe is particularly alert to help children make up deficiencies. \nEven though the children in a classroom differ markedly from one \nanother, they· have marked resemblances to one another. \'Good teach\xad\ning provides for these common abilities. While the traditional school \ntended to emphasize the same fixed pattern of tasks for all children at \nthe same time, the modern school provides freedom for individual \nactivity within a common background of experienre. During the free \nplay period in a modern school, the children go about separate activi\xad\nties and follow their own individual interests. At another period, the \nchildren engage iii group activities in which all participate. The edu\xad\ncational problem is that of providing an atmosphere within the same \nframework which will give opportunities for individual development C" \nto a high degree and which will develop group responsiveness al\'ld \nability to work for group goals. \nImplicit is the assumpti<ln that the teacher is able to recognize \nand encourage specific abilities and interests and is adaptable and \nacute in developing an educational program to utilize them for indi\xad\nvidual development and for group purposes. This requires some shift\xad\ning from year to year and even from month to month in the arrange\xad\nment and organization of group programs in accordance with the abili\xad\nties of the children. In one group two or three children may be much \ninterested in art, while in another there may be little or no skill in art \n', '94 THEORY OJ!\' CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \nbut much .in music. In the first instance a skilful teacher may make \nparticular use of the art products. In the second group Jmrticular use \nmay be made of the musical skills. An alert teacher can superimpose \nupon a basic and somewhat fixed program a shifting and adaptable \nprogram to utilize and develop individual interests and skills. \nEmotional Security and Control. Substantial evidence exists that \nchildren make the best adjustment in an environment in which they \nfeel secure and with adults in whom they have confidence. Much also " \ndepends upon whether or not the child feels heis an accepted member \nof the group or whether he feels insecure and outside the group. The \natmosphere of security and co-operation created within the school\xad\nroom by the teacher affects learning in all its phases. In some degree, \nthis atmosphere is independent of the specific procedures used by the \nteacher; in part, it is dependent upon them. Thus, a teacher may be \nstrict and yet secure co-operation, respect, and even love from her \nchildren, while another teacher who is strict may fail in securing co\xad\noperation, love, and respect. An easygoing teacher may bind the chil\xad\ndren to her or find that the children reject her. Emphasis, then, goes \nupon the whole personality and upon the manner in vvhich the teacher \nhas met her own personal problems. \nTwo points of view exist with regard to the attitude and practice \nof the teacher toward the emotional difficulties which develop between \nchildren. One is that the teacher must closely supervise the children, \nthat relations between children should always be at or near the \nperfect level, and that the controversies incident to human living \nshould be avoided by not permitting them to arise. On the surface \neverything is smooth-no matter what turmoil lies unqerneath. The \nother permits some social freedom because friction, hostility, quarrel\xad\ning, and difficulties in human interrelations are recognized as part of \nthe normal life process. To a limited degree, social interchanges in \nthe school should be permitted to enable children to develoi) realistic \nattitudes toward one another and thus come to understand the emo\xad\ntional and social reactions of other persons. The first conception is a \nhoth01,1se conception of complete protection; the second, the view that \nchildren can be permitted real life experiences under supervision in \nmoderate degree in order to prepare them for the majorresponsibilities \nthey will encounter later. The first gives a false impression of security \nand order, while the second, although more immediately charged with \nfeeling, builds for strength and security. \nManagement nnd Discipline. In good teaching the child is not \nmade more dependent or attached to the teacher, but rather, more \n', "ANDERSON 95 \nindependent and self-reliant and less attached or dependent upon par\xad\nticular adults. H takes skill to free the child and at the same time \nkeep him feeling secure and significant. If the teacher is able to \nanticipate problems before they occur and to set the stage so that the \nchild can acquire competence through his own efforts, she will do \nwell. Her role with young children cannot be described in terms of \nrigid, fixed, and dominating controls but, rather, as one which departs \nradically from the conventional concept of teaching at older age levels. \nThe teacher of young children is not one apart from the group but a \nvery vital and integral part of it. If she maintains great social dis\xad\ntance by being aloof and not participating freely in children's activities, \nshe will be ineffective. She should.not be so far away that the school \nis completely dominated by the children nor so much the center of .the \nstage that all activities revolve about her every wish, with all children \noriented toward her at all times. Instead, the teaching function is con- F \nceived in terms of setting the stage in such a way that she is a part \nof the situation without seeming to be; she is only rarely in the \nforeground but is always significantly in the background. All possi\xad\nbility of good teaching is sometimes lost because of the sheer number \nof children for whom the teacher is responsible. Too many children \nmay result in domination by a fixed schedule. \nDisciplinary and management controls reach a dead and automatic \nlevel quickly, unless the teacher is continuously alert, is aware of the \nsignificance of her relationship to the pupil, has some knowledge of \nthe importance of the atmosphere she creates within her room, and has \nsome insight into her own capacity and function as a social stimulus. \nSuch attitudes need continuous reinforcement through the interchange \nof experiences among teachers, through the participation by teachers \nin professional organizations, and by a program of in-service training \nand supervision which will keep the creative spirit alive within the \nteacher. \nPLAcE oF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN THE Co~nruNITY \nThe child is a member of a family, a member of a group of asso\xad\nciates near his own age level, and a member of the community. With \ngrowth, his circle of relations will widen as he is played l.J.pon by the \nvarious influences in the community and as he enlarges his own sphere \nof action. Neither vertically, in his development, nor horizontally, \nin his relations with his environment, is it possible to draw sharp \nand hard lines that isolate. \nSchools are established to acquaint the child with the lore of \n", '96 \'l\'HEORY OF CHILDHOOD KDUCA\'l\'ION \nsociety, to give him skills and attitudes of personal and social value, \nand w prepare him for future living. The school is imbedded in the \ncommunity and in the culture of which it is a. part. Schools for young \nchildren do not differ in fundamental purpose from those for older \nchildren but do have a significant educational function. \nProgression in Educational Program. For the best development \nof the child a vertical integration which will tie the child\'s experiences \ntogether is desirable. \'The elementary school should build upon the \npreschool, the high school upon the elementary school, the college upon \nthe high school. This is a reversal of our traditional practice in which \neducation has moved from top downward and in which the needs of \nthe college have set the pattern of high-school education, and the needs \nof the high school have set the pattern of elementary education. Good \nintegration involves a compromise between the needs of the on-moving, \ndeveloping organism and the demands which society imposes. The \ncontinuity of the individual and the changing pattern·of society, alike, \ncall for an education that starts with young children and continues \nthrough adult life. \nThe Value of Early Childhood Education. What is a good school? \nWhat is a bad .school? These are difficult questions to answer since \nany definition of "goodness" or "badness" depends upon the criteria \nset up. Thus, a well-ordered, very neat, and a rigidly scheduled school, \nwith every object spotless and in its appropriate place, may be a very \ngood school in its physical aspects and yet be a very bad schooL in \nits psychological and social effects upon children. Another school, \nwhich in physical appearance and general arrangements seems to be \nvery bad, may actually, if its effects upon children are studied, tum \nout to be very good. \nThis problem of a criterion not only enters into the evaluation of \nparticular schools but also into the study of the value of early child\xad\nhood education as a whole. If the effectiveness of a school for young \nchildren is measured in terms of the ability to read or to do arithmetic, \nthe test centers in a content with which the school may have little or \nno concern. If the maturity and self-reliance of the children and \ntheir ability to do for themselves and to participate socially are \nmeasured, the study will be nearer the experiences with which schoois \nfor young children deal. Much the same question can be raised oon\xad\ncerning the comparisons in later school years of the progress of chil\xad\ndren with and without nursery-school and kindergarten experience. \nFar too often the comparisons are made in terms of effectiveness in \nformal school work, to which the contribution of the nursery school \n', 'ANDERSON 97 \nand kindergarten is minor. Much too seldom are comparisons made \nin terms of general adjustment, social relations, personal development, \nand zest and enthugiasm for living-the area,s l\'lmphasized in es.rly \neducation. \nIt is particularly difficult to test the value of an educational pro\xad\ngram when, and if, it is viewed as a whole. On the other hand, the \nspecific contribution made to a particular area of skill or knowledge \nby particular and specialized programs of instruction can be readily \ntested and is often of great value. Who is to say that elementary \neducation is bad or good, that high-school education is bad or good, \nwhen experience in elementary and high_ school is in the background \nof almost every member of our society? What can be said is that \nsuch experience is essential for adaptation in our particular society, \nbecause a person without such education is a lost soul. ·The evaluation \nof nursery-school and kindergarten education should not and cannot \nbe made except in terms of how the child, as a learning, growing, de\xad\nveloping organism, utilizes and benefits from the experiences pro\xad\nvided. And even this answer would be only a partial one, since pro\xad\ngrams of education continually improve or at least change with the \npassing years. Education is not something with an all or none value, \nnot something permanently fixed. It changes with society and society \nchanges with it. \nNeed of Professional Public Auspices. In general, the best work \nin education is done by professionally trained people who meet the \nstate requirements, which are statements of the type and amount of \nexperience that society has found desirable for the task of teaching \nchildren. Some regard nursery education as distinct and separate from \npublic education. It is largely an historical ac~ident that schools for \nyoung children developed outside of public auspices. But with the \ndemonstration of their value, the logical place for them is in the public \nschool system. Since society has already established the agencies for \neducating children and has entrusted the responsibility for them to a \nparticular group of people, any consideration of future developments \nmust recognize the purposes of the public educational system and \nseek to include the program for educating young children with that \nsystem. Further, although custodial institutions, such as day nurseries \nfor young children, haveexisted for some time to meet special needs, \nas time passes they will be forced to develop an "educational" rather \nthan a "service:\' point of view, in exactly the same way as the cus\xad\ntodial institutions for older children are being replaced by institutions \nwith remedial, preventive, and educational philosophies. \n', '98 \'l\'HEORY OP CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \nRelation to Home and Community. Horizontally, education is a \njoint enterprise of home, school, and community. That view which \nisol~ted the child from nine to three o\'clock each day, which discour\xad\naged contacts with parents, and which held that the school was inde\xad\npendent of the remainder of the community is well in the past now. \nBoth evidence and experience indicate that the child cannot be \ntaught well without some knowledge of his home background and his \nrelations in the community. A child may do badly in school, not be\xad\ncause of an intellectual deficiency but, possibly, because of a disturbed \nfamily situation which will soon result in divorce of the parents. Be\xad\ncause his parents can supply him with all the aids to good work, one \nchild may make more progress than another of equal ability. Because \nhe is kept up late, a young child may be so fatigued that he cannot \nparticipate in the play and social activities on a par with other chil\xad\ndren. Wherever we dip into the complex of relations between the \nindividual and the community, the school and the community, the \nteacher and the community, and the family and the school, there \narises evidence of a need for the co-ordination and integration of the \nwork of those concerned with the child. \nParent Education and Early Childhood Education. Out of the \nparticularly intimate relation between the school for young children \nand the ,home arises both the need and the opportunity for an active \nprogram of parent education. Because the parents of young children \nare much interested in their welfare and face new problems,daily in \ntheir care, they are especially interested in knowing how to improve \ntheir relations with children, often more so than parents of older \nchildren who are more likely to have set attitudes. \nAmong the many forms which parent education takes are: (1) \nvisits of parents to schools to see actual practice in methods of hand\xad\nling young children; (2) conferences between parents and teachers or \nother specialists on the behavior and development of the child; (3) \norganized study groups; and (4) a parent-teacher association with a \nplanned educational program. Parent-education activities are both \ninformal and formal and vary greatly in amount. Because all aspects \nof family life relate to children, they can be of far wider scope than \nchild training. \nThe modern movement for parent education has paralleled the \nmovement for nursery education, just as a century ago the kinder\xad\ngarten came into existence primarily as a device for parent education. \nSchools for young children consider parent education an important \nphase of their program, in order to use the unusual and direct oppor"-\n', "ANDERSON 99 \ntunities they have for contact with parents. How much parent edu\xad\ncation is undertaken often depends on their general theory of edu\xad\ncation and the possibilities of freeing staff members for work with \nparents. Throughout, education at all levels is marked by increasing \nawareness of its responsibilities for adult, parent, and community \neducation. \nTHE FUTURE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION \nTwenty-five years ago the nursery school was relatively untried; \na hundred years ago the kindergarten was relatively untried; two \nhundred years ago the public elementary school was relatively un\xad\ntried. Each phase of public education first goes through a period of \norigination, then one of development, and, finally one of acceptance \nand incorporation by society. When the first approach is made, the \neducational program arises out of the needs of a limited group. For \ninstance, Robert Owen, who became interested in nursery education \nto meet the needs of working mothers, found his eyes opened to the \nneeds of all children. \nRegardless of the purposes of the early developments, which in\xad\ncluded such diverse aims as research, custodial care, provisions for \nchildren of working mothers, demonstrations for parents, and meeting \nthe immediate needs of children, in time there has been movement \nforward to better understanding, appreciation, and insight into the \nneeds of all young children. With that insight the program invariably \ngains vitality and strength and continues to develop. Adults also profit \nmuch from their association with and study of children. Soon new \nprocedures, professions, and institutions arise. \nNursery Experience for Every Child. Although there is Rome dif\xad\nference of opinion as to the desirability of school experience for every \nyoung child, those who have worked with young children and know \nmost about them feel that early education is desirable for all. With \nthirty years' of experience in the education of young children behind \nthem, they are quite sure that good school environments can be estab\xad\nlished for children at early age levels. For particular classes of young \nchildren who have disadvantages, chiefly of a social nature, school \nexperience is especially valuable. These include (a) handicapped chil\xad\ndren, (b) only children or children from very small families, (c) chil\xad\ndren physically isolated in outlying neighborhoods, (d) children \nsocially isolrtted because of a lack of playmates, (e) children in family \nsituations so tense that normal adjustment cannot be made, and (f) \nchildren in small apartments with limited indoor and outdoor play \nspace. \n", '100 I"\' THEORY OF OHILDHOOB EDUCATION \nr , \n, The !Future.: It has been said that a society can never remain \nstationaryfit either goes forward or it goes backward. So with most \ndevelopmental processes in the individual or the group. On the whole, \ndespite obvious deficiencies at some points, the program of early child\xad\nhood education is better now than it was in 1925, in 1930, or in 1935. \nMore is known about children and their needs. Educational thinking \nat all levels has been modified by the concern with young children, \nby the stimulating research done, and by the convincing demonstra\xad\ntions of what good schools can do. This dynamic process conditions \nthe future. Out of the strength, insight, and enthusiasm of the present \nprogram will come a future in which the needs of young children will \nbe more adequately met. . , \n']</pre>
