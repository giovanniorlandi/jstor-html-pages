Official\nannouncement to this effect from VI\nenna, supplementing German claims\nthat the Russian grip along this\nsouthern front had been broken, In.\ndicates that the important Lublin\nChelm railway now is strongly held\nby the invaders, cutting off one line\nof retreat for the Russian forces in\nsouthern Poland.\nLondon, Aug. 2.-The Russians now\nare facing the problem of evacuating\nWarsaw and the surroundrig country\nwithout losing their armies, while the\nAustro-German forces are making a\nsupreme effort to get across their line\nof retreat. The Teutons are said to\nhave met with partial success in this\nattempt, a Berlin official report stat-i\nIng that Field Marshal von Mackensen,\nresuming the offensive, had reached,\nthe Chelm-L4blin railway, about mid\nway between those two cities, and that,\nsoutheast of this as far as the Bug\nriver, the Russian front had been\n"shaken."\nThe success of General von Mack\nensen In getting across this railway,\nafter having been virtually stopped by! I\nthe Russian counter attack, denies at\nleast one line of retreat to the Rus- I\nsians who might still be between\nhim and Warsaw, and also places the !\nGermans in a position to move against]\nthe Bug river front should this be\ndecided upon.\nBritish military critics, however,\nrefuse to believe that Grand Duk)\nNicholas, commander-in-chief of th, E\nRussian forces, has not provided for all,\ncontingencies or that he was not fairly t\nsure of the safety of his troops be- o\nfore indicating to the world that he i\nhad decided to take up a new line. E\nIndeed, the news contained in the t\nBerlin official statement that the Ger- N\nmans have crossed the Vistula river r\nsoutheast of Warsaw, between the Pi- i\nlica river and Kozienice, leads the mil.\nitary writers to the belief that the I\nRussians already have fallen back in 4\nthis region and that perhaps even the r\nfortress of Ivangorod has been left to f\nIts fate.\nitS iate.\nRussians Applying Torch.\nThere is no news of the situation on\nthe Narew river or of General von\nBuelow\'s wider outflanking movement\nin Kovno province. However, the opin\nion is expressed here that as the Ger\nman plans contemplate a series of at\ntacks rather than a simultaneous one,\nIt is probable they are waiting for Von\nMackensen to reach some previously\narranged position before they resume\ntheir attacks.\nAcccrdilrg to dispatches received\nhere, the country around Warsaw\nwhich the Russians are leaving to the\nInvaders has been put to the torch,\nwhile the city itself has been denuded\nof everything that might be of use to\nthe Germans if it falls into their hands.\nRichest Girl is Married.\nHarbor Point, Mich., August 2.\nMiss Catherine Barker, an orphan,\nsaid to be the richest 19-year-old\ngirl in the world, was married here\nto Howard Spalding, Jr., son of air.\nAnd Mrs. Howard H.

Five years ago when Miss\nBarker\'s father, organizer of the\nHaskell-Barker freight car factories,\nand head of a dozen other great in\ndustrial concerns, died, she came\ninto a fortune of over $30,000,000.\nHer income is said to be afiproxi.\nmately $1000,000 a year.\nJoffre Favors Waiting Game.\nParis, Aug. 2.-France is fully pre\npared for a winter campaign. It is\nunderstood General Joffre is unwilling\nto force a decisive battle on the ground\nthat Germany must give way under\nlong drawn out pressure and by such\ntactics he can save France thousands\nof men. He is said to be an exponent\nof defeating Germany by attrition, no\nmatter how long it takes, France and\nher allies being in a better position\nto play a waiting game than the cen\ntral European powers.\nNew British Note Expected.\nWashington, Aug. 2.-The supple\nmental British note regarding the\nrights of neutrals at sea and within\nblockaded lines, will be delivered to\nthe embassy at London within a day\nor two, Ambassador Page advised the\nstate department.\nExcellent Returns\nOf the threshing done so far, the\nyield has been all that has been pre\ndicted. Carr & Peck\'s machine has\nfinished two jobs, one of 60 acres for\nWm. Downs and one of 60 acres for J,\nR. Moore. Both are volunteer crops\nand the Downs piece averaged 40 bush\nels per acre and the Moore piece at 30\nbushels.\nRoy Atkinson was threshing his own\ngrain yesterday and the McGeorge\nmachine I started yesterday at Dan\nSyla\'s. No report has been received\nfrom these places but they have been\ngenerally estimated at 30 bushels.\nAppointed Vice-Consul\nJohn Dahlgren, president of the First\nNational bank of Ronan, this week re\nceived the appointment of vice-consul\nfor the Swedish and American govern\nments for the state of Montana. The\nappointment comes jointly from the\nking of Sweden and the president of\nthe United States and is one of the im\nportant positions connected with our\nforeign diplomatic service. Mr. Dahl\ngren is one of the big men in Montana\nand his selection for this position is a\nwise one. His many friends through\nout the country are pleased at his se\nlection and extend congratulations.\n2 ACTIVE PROBES OF WRECK\nChicago, Aug. 2.-Investigation to\ndetermine whether anyone was crimi. I\nnally to blame for the capsizing of I\nthe steamer Eastland in the Chicago\nriver with the loss of a thousand lives,\nwas narrowed to a federal grand jury\nand the steamboat inspection service\nunder Secretary of Commerce William\nC. Redfield.\nThe ship, still lying on its side\nwhere it fell at its wharf, was taken\nover by a federal marshal on orders I\nfrom Judge K. M. Landis of the United\nStates district court. The county\ngrant jury, it was decided by State\'s\nAttorney Maclay Hoyne, probably did\nnot have sufficient jurisdiction to ac\ncomplish anything and ceased its in.\nquiry for the present.\nDevelops Few New Facts.\nSecretary Redfield\'s examination of\nsteamboat inspectors continued, but i\ndeveloped few new facts. Charges\nthat the steamboat inspection service\nwould not be stringent enough with\nits own members continued and elicit\ned from Secretary Redfield a repeti\ntion of the statement that the inquiry\nwas according to law and that judg 1\nment should not be passed until the In. €\nvestigation was ended. t\nBefore Mr. Redfield began his rear.\nIngs labor leaders issued statements s\ndeclaring that the department of com- t\nmerce Inquest would be a whitewash\nfor federal inspectors. These labor,\nleaders telegraphed a protest to Pres. C\nident Wilson, but received no reply.\nAfter testimony before Secretary a\nRedfield, Mayor William Hale Thomp- a\nson, Assistant Corporation Counsel c\nKorshak and others\' said that the ex- n\namination of witnesses seemed to them\nunsatisfactory, while Assistant State\'s\nAttorney Sullivan thought the ques\ntions put by Secretary Redfield were\ntoo leading.\nWaits 28 Years for Bride; Wins.\nWinona, Mimn., Aug. 2.-James I.\nGetman, Portage, Wis., has just claim.\ned a bride for whom he had waited\nmore than a score of years. The bride\nwas Coraetta Morrill of Minneapolis.\nTwenty-eight years ago the bride\ngroom was a small school boy attend.\nIng regluarly the little structure at\nHancock, Wis. He was 10 years old.\nA little playmate, a girl of 6, also at.\ntended the same school. That girl\nwas the person who has just become\na bride for a second time.\nAlligator Fish at Madison.\nMadison, Wis., Aug. 2.-A curious\nfish, the like of which no one ever\nsaw around these lakes before, has\nbeen caught in Lake Monona. It re\nsembles an alligator, an eel, a garfish\nand a mackeral, and has a bill much\nwider and flatter than that of a duck.\nThe fish has two sets of propeller fins,\nand its mouth, pursed like a tobacco\npouch, is on the reverse side of the\nhead. Its back is covered with heavy\nscales similar to those on an alliga.\ntor.\nSinger Held for Speeding.\nSanta Ana, Cal., August 2.-"We\ndon\'t care if you\'re the president,"\nmotor police told Mme. Schumann\nHeink when they arrested the fa\nmous singer for speeding, and she\nprotested: "I\'m Schumann-Heink."\nHer son, Hans, with her was fined\n$10. The singer demanded a jury\ntrial. When Justice Cox set it for\nAug. 24, Schumann-Heink\'s Indigna\ntion reached the boiling point, as she\ndeclared it Impossible for her to be\nhtrs then, and the justice refused to\nphange the date.\nBEST OF HIGH SCHOOLS\nFOR DISTRICT NO. 28\nThe high school teaching force of\ndistrict No. 28 will be one third\nlarger when school opens September 6.\nAll needed equipment will be supplied.\nThe school board believes that the peo\nple want and are entitled to high school\nadvantages equal to those of the city\nor any other section of the country,\nand precisely such advantages are as\nsured by the arrangements which have\nbeen made for the ensuing year\'s work.\nIt is expected that the enrollment will\nbe greatly increased, not only by pupils\nin this district but also by pupils from\nwithout the district. As soon as par\nents in Missoula and adjoining counties\nlearn of the superior advantages offered\nhere it is believed that they will send\ntheir children here for their high school\neducation rather than into the over\ncrowded high schools of the city.\nThe new law which places our high\nschools on the same basis of support as\nthat of the high school in Missoula, has\nassisted materially in making such ex\ncellent advantages available in District\n28. By virtue of this law our schools\nnow become county high schools. It is\nnow all up to the parents. Are they\ngoing to send their children in sufficient\nnumbers to make all of this worth\nwhile or not?\nSupervision, consolidation, and rural\nhigh schools have been the chief fac\ntors in the school system which has al\nready made this section so widely known\nas progressive and promising. There\nare comparatively few communities in\nWashington, Montana and Idaho which\nhave not heard indirectly of the school\nsystem in District No. 28, Missoula\ncounty. As an advertising medium for\nbuilding up this country with the most\ndesirable class of settlers, our schools\nare probably doing more than all other\nagencies combined. Papers like the\nSpokesman-Review and the Helena In\ndependent have published, without the\nknowledge of any of the officials of Dis\ntrict No. 28, articles on aspects of the\nschool work here. Superintendents\nhave made trips of several hundred\nmiles to examine into the organization\nand workings of our schools, and have\ngone away convinced of the extraordi\nnary benefits which the form of organ\nization and the policies of this district f\nassure. The district superintendent c\nhas been invited for two summers to t\ngive a six weeks series of lectures at t\nthe state university on rural schools.\nAll of this puts the people of this\nsection on test under the eyes of\nthis state and of other states. For the e\nmaking of Welch rarebit. the rabbit.\nof all else, is essential! The people\nmust provide the pupils, enthusiastically\nand with a sense of local patriotism, as\na measure of love and obligation to the\nchildren, and as a mark of duty to the\nneighbors and to the state.\nNot only is the work of our high\nschools accredited for admission of pu\npils into all of the educational institu\ntions of the state, but, as it meets the\nconditions of the North Central Asso\nciation, it will be accepted by the\nhigher institutions of the Northwest.\nThree years are offered at Arlee and\nat St. Ignatius, four years at Ronan,\none or two years at Leon and at Elliott.\nIf a central building is erected west of\nRonan, standard high school work will\nbe offered there also. This district is\nbetter supplied with high schools than\nany other section of the state of corre\nsponding area, with possibly one sec\ntion.\nAs specialists in home economics have\nbeen secured for Arlee, St. Ignatius\nand Ronan, a full four year course will\nbe offered at those points in the sub\nject. Every other subject will also be\ngiven by successful teachers who are\ngraduates of standard universities and\nhave specialized in the teaching of their\nspecial subjects.\nPupils who have finished the eighth\ngrade and passed the eighth grade ex\namination will be accepted without con\ndition. Pupils who have finished part\nof the eighth grade work and are able\nto carry some work in high school will\nbe accepted as high school pupils, but\nthey will be required to carry the un\nfinished work of the eighth grade also\nuntil it is satisfactorily completed.\nEvery child in this district who wants\na high school edgcation can get it; pro\nvided that he or she has fair health and\nis willing to work, and provided that\nthe parent will lend encouragement. If\nthe child is within walking or riding\ndistance there is no excuse. If the\nchild is not within such distance and\nthe parent can afford to pay his board\nat some point near the consolidated\nschool for five days in the week, letting\nhim come home for Saturday and Sun\nday, there is no good excuse. If such\nis the case and the parent if too poor\nto pay board, then the child can find\nwork at the school or at assisting with\nchores or housework, and acquire a high\nschool education just the same. Such\na child will be more highly respected\nthan his wealthier fellows, and will be\nhaving the advantage of practical les\nsons in shifting for himself. If your\nchildren (want assistance in finding a\nplace where they can earn their board\nwith a family whose influence will be\ngood, write to Supt. S. R. Logan, Leon,\nabout it right away.\nThe school management will take\nspecial pains to care for children\'s phy\nsical and moral welfare as well as their\nintellectual development. Since the\nenrollment is comparatively small this\ncan be done very effectually, each\nchild having much individual attention.\nSince nearly everyone realizes that a\nhigh school education is even more nec\nessary for success for the son and\ndaughter than was elementary instruc\ntion for the father and mother, it is\nreasonable to suppose that every parent\nand citizen will do his part in bringing\nabout a maximum use of the advan\ntages offered and in increasing the\nfacilities of the schools to the utmost.\nWILSON TO ACT IN MEXICO\nDECIDES UPON STEPS FOR RE.\nSTORING PEACE IN REPUBLIC\nOnly An Unexpected Move in Country\nItself Will Further Delay\nAction, Is Report.\nWashington, Aug. 2.-Definite steps\ntoward restoration of peace li Mexico\nwill be taken immediately upon Presi\ndent Wilson% return to Washington\nnext week. What specific action the\nPresident may have decided on has\nnot been disclosed, but it was authori\ntatively stated that the executive de\npartments of the government were pre\nparing to carry out promptly the pro\ngram he determined on.\nOnly an unexpected move in Mex\nleo itself to end the strife, it is said,\nwould further delay affirmative action\nby the United States to restore consti\ntutional government in the war-torn\nrepublic.\nArmed intervention is not believed\nto be contemplated in the President\'s\nprogram. Many officials believe no\nforceful measures will be required. Re\ncent reports have reached here that\nthe faction leaders are inclined to yield\nto the demands of this government for\na peace conference.\nTo Give Final Chance.\nReports generally are credited that\na message will be sent to the opposing\nleaders, giving them a final chance to\ncease hhtilities within a limited time\nand assemble a conference to settle\ntheir differences. Possibilities of an\nother failure to do so ir view of the\nlast refusal of General Carranza to\njoin in a conference with his adver\nsaries is being considered by the Pres\nident, it is declared, in formulating a\nplan of action.\nWhether in that event a general em\nbargo on arms exportations will be\nimposed or American troops employed\nto assure transportation of food to the\nstarving people of the country, cannot\nbe predicted. It is known, however,\nthat the army ani navy have, been pre\nparing and now are ready for any\neventuality.\nSecretary Lansing said that the rep\nresentations sent to Generals Carran\nza, Villa and Zapata, urging that routes\nto Mexico City be opened to provision\ntrains, were forceful. The message to\nCarranza, who controls the railroad\nfrom Vera Cruz, was particularly em\nphatic. While not couched as a "de\nmand that the railroad to Mexico City\nbe opened and kept open," its purport\nwas to that effect.\nFail to Retake Pelagosa.\nRome, via Paris, Aug. 2.-An at\ntempt was made by a squadron of Aus\ntrian cruisers and a flotilla of torpedo\nboat destroyers to recapture the Aus\ntrian Island of Pelagosa in the Adria\ntic, which was occupied by Italian\nnaval forces, according to an official\ncommunication issued by the Italian\nministry of marine.\nThe attack was repulsed, the state\nment adds, and some members of the\nAustrian landing party were forced to\nswim to their ships.\nPope Issues Peace Appeal.\nLondon, Aug. 2.-The Rome corre\nspondent of Reuter\'s Telegram com\npany states that in the Osservatore\nRomano, official organ of the Vatican,\nthere appears a letter addressed by\nPope Benedict to the heads of the bel\nligerent countries, inviting all friends\nof peace to unite with him in his de\nsire to terminate the wars.\nIn this letter, which was written on\nthe anniversary of the outbreak of the\nwar, July 28, the pope asks why there\nshould not be initiated a direct or lac\ndirect exchange of views.\nDeath of Henry J. Irish\nThe community was shocked last Fri\n1 day evening when word reached town\nof the death of Henry J. Irish at his\nfarm home two and one-half miles\nnorthwest of Ronan. Mr. Irish had\nbeen in the hay field with his son,\nLewis, and others, the greater part of\nthe day, and while not doing any real\nheavy work, had assisted in minor\nways. He came to the house about six\no\'clock and as he stepped onto the\nporch was stricken with the attack that\nended in his death a few seconds later.\nHis wife heard him on the porch and\non going to the door found him leaning\non a porch column for support. As\nsisted by Mrs. Lewis Irish, she man\naged to get him into the house, where\nhe expired within a few seconds with\nout a word passing his lips. Dr. Fuhrer\nwas summoned immediately but on ar\nrival at the Irish home the stricken \'\nman was beyond human aid.\nFuneral services were held Sunday\nmorning at 10 o\'clock at the residence,\nRev. White of the M. E. church of Pol\nson conducting the services. Many\nneighbors and friends were present to\npay their last respects and the floral\nofferings were profuse and most beau\ntiful. Messrs. Flatten, Durst and\nStansbury sang "Jesus Lover of My\nSoul" at the close of the ceremonies.\nWhile the Masonic order, of which he\nwas a member, was not in charge of\nthe funeral services, local members {\nwere in attendance and acted as pall\nbearers. They were Dr. Fuhrer, W.\nG. Brown, J. D. Glathart, I. L. Dear\ndorff, Jas. O\'Neil and E. H. Rathbone.\nThe funeral cortege left the residence\nat 11 o\'clock and arrived at the ceme\ntery at 2 o\'clock, where short services\nwere held by Rev. White of the Pres\nbyterian church of Poison.\nHenry J. Irish was born March 29,\n1846, in Erie county, N. Y., and emi\ngrated to Wisconsin with his parents\nwhen eight years of age. At the age\nof 14 he went to Minnesota and in 1871\nwas married to Mary Dieter at Waba\n\'shaw. In 1871 they moved to North\nDakota, residing there until 1884 when\nthey moved to Minneapolis, where he\nwas a traveling salesman for 21 years.\nIn 1905 they moved to Alberta, Canada,\nwhere they resided until they came to\nRonan in April, 1911.\nDeceased leaves a wife, Mary Irish,\nand a son, Lewis C., who were with\nhim at the last, three brothers, S.

Bulen of Shelby, I\nMontana, the latter arriving only in I\ntime to attend the last sad rites ai the\ngrave.\nHenry J. Irish was one of our most\nrespected citizens. He was a devoted\nhusband and father and a loyal friend. 1\nHis fondness for children was marked I\nand he was universally loved by them,\na result of his very kind and jovial dis- I\nposition. His sudden death was a blow\nto his immediate ramily, relatives and\nclose friends and the entire community\nextends sincere and heartfelt sympathy\nto the bereaved.\nRULES OF THE ROAD\nFOR AUTOMOBILE DRIVERS\nWe print the following "Rules of the\nRoad" for the benefit of auto drivers\n(Fords\'not included) who have hereto\nfore not been familiar with them.

The attack on the Dar\ndanelles has brought into prominence\nthis little island, whose existence-was\npreviously unknown to the millions.\nThe peaceful and uneventful life of\nits 3,000 inhabitants has been dis\ntracted. The sound of the guns, the\nupheaval of a world-war has come to\ntheir doors. It has one dominating\nheight, this little island of six by\nthree miles-Mount Elias-and to this\nheight during the bombardments\nflocked all the Tenediotes to watch\nthe epoch-making fight.\nBefore the Balkan wars the Moslem\ninhabitants were in the najority;\nwith the advent of the Christian rule\nof the Greeks most of them left, cross\ning to the opposite shore only four\nmiles away, where the half-moon of\nIslam still floats. A few still remain,\nforming a group apart, keeping to\nthemselves and avoiding their fellow%1\nChristian citizens. If you want ta\nget them you must go to their spirt\nItual chief, the Mufti.\nOn the day of the attempt to force\nthe narrows all of them climbed upj\nto Mount Elias, but they kept apart,\nfrom their fellow islanders, forming\na group to themselves, with the Muft\nat their head, silently watching the\ndrama of their country enacted be;\nfore their eyes.\nNo sound was uttered by them that\nday; only on the intelligent face of\nthe Mufti could one discern reliet\nthat the day hbd not gone so well for\nthe allies, that another respite had\nbeen gained for the Empire of Islam.\nTenedos, besides its normal popula\ntion supports 2,000 Greek refugees\nfrom the opposite shores, persecuted\nand expelled from their homes. These\nalso flocked to Mount Elias. Many of\nthem were from Chanak and the vil\nlages in the straits. They were\nwatching their hearths and homes\nshelled by the fleet, but they cared\nlittle whether their belongings were\nset on fire, hatred against those who 1\ndrove them from their homes being\nupperrmost in thought.\nEvery shell from the ship that was\nseen to go home was acclaimed by\nthem, after the excitable eastern\nfashion, with loud shouts of hatred,\nsuch as "Burn the tyrants! Kill the\ndogs!"n\ndogs!"\nWhen night came and it was seen\nthat the allies would not pass that day,\nthey silently and sorrowfully descend\np ed from Mount Elias, with bitterness\nin their hearts that the day of theirx,\ndeliverance had not yet come.\nIt was not likely that, with the\nunique position Tenedos afforded for\nwatching the naval operations, it\nwould have been left for long undis\ncovered by war correspondents. Tele\ngrams flashed to the world\'s press\nfrom its shores, stirred editors and\nsoon correspondents from all parts of\nthe world were on their way to this\npreviously unknown spot.\nOne by one they arrived by the\nweekly boat service to the island, un\ntil with the last batch, their numbers\ngrew to a score.\nThe one sleepy official who acted\nas postmaster, telegraph director,\nclerk and telegraph boy, saw with re"\ngret his peaceful life invaded. He\nwas called upon suddenly to do the\nwork that ten men could not cope\nwith. He was taking more messages\nin an hour than he would ordinarily\nbe called upon to deal with in a year.\nIn despair he allowed his little den\non an inner office to be invaded, and\nhe gave himself up as lost when ten,\nfifteen and even twenty correspond.\nents at once called upon him to take\ndispatches.\nThere was nothing to be done but\nturn the correspondents themselves\ninto telegraph clerks, registering and\ntaking in their own money, and car\nrying their own dispatches to the\nEastern Telegraph office.\nAnd what a bewildering variety of\ncurrency there was to deal with: Sov.\nereigns and louis, shillings, French\npieces, and French and English banlk\nnotes, intermingled with Turkish and\nGreek coins and paper. A Babylon of\nrates, values and exchange to deal\nwith. It was sufficient to drive crazy\na much stronger brain than that of\nthe old telegraphist.\nINDIAN CROESUS IS FOUND\nHis Allotment In the Cushing Oil\nField Is Worth Several\nMillions.\nTulsa, Okla.-Barney Thlocco, the\nmissing and much wanted Indian,\nwhose allotment in the Cushing oil\nfield is worth several millions, has\nbeen found in Mexico by Ed Drury of\nTulsa, Tex., formerly engaged in the\noil business in Oklahoma.\nThlocco, according to Drury, was un\naware until he told him that he is\none of the richest men in Oklahoma\nand that the government and scores of\noil producers have for months been\nmoving heaven and earth to locate\nhim.\nAccording to Drury, Thlocco has\nbeen in Mexico several years, speaks\nSpanish fluently and apparently pre\nters the turbulent career of a Mexican\ncitisen to the ease and abandonment\nof an American millionaire.\nA. D. Stephens of Crookston,\nMinn., and John Dahlgren of\nMissoula, spent Wednesday and\nThursday in Ronan and the sur\nrounding country. Both are\nstochholders in the First National\nbank and are highly elated over\nthe outlook for the valley. Mr.\ni Stephens came all the way from\nCrookston in his automobile and\nwhile he says the crops are ex\ncellent every foot of the way, he\nsaw nothing to equal the grains\nnow being harvested and thresh\ned in the Mission valley.
