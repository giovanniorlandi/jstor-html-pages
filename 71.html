Treves, or Trier, as\nthe Germans call It, Into which the\nYanks, marched recently, Is older than\nhistory, which begins for It half a cen\ntury before the birth of Christ. Then,\nas the capital of the Celtic Trevirl,\none of the most powerful Belgian\ntribes. It was captured by the Romans\nunder Julius Caesar. It was made a\nRoman colony under the name of Au\ngusta Trevlrorura and , was strongly\nfortified. By 14 B. C. It had become\nthe niost Important northern outpost\nof the Roman empire. It was an Im\nperial residence early in the Christian\nera and the administrative center from\nwhich Gaul, Britain and Spain were\nruled. The poet Ausonlus described it\nas "Borne beyond the Alps." Constan\ntine the Great lived there about twenty-five\nyears. He and his successors\nbeautified It with public works and\nmagnificent private villas dotted the\nhillside all around.\' Some of the finest\nRoman relics north of the Alps re\nmain to this day In Treves.\nFrom the earliest times Treves, be\ncause of its strategic position and the\nrich country surrounding It, was \'an\nobject of warfare. - The Franks par\nticularly desired It and they made\nmany expeditions against it. They\ncontinued their attacks after the Ro\nman occupation. . Three times they\nsacked it and held It for short periods.\nAbout the middle of the fifth century\ntliey gained permanent possession and\nmade it their capital. The Frarikish\nkings gradually transferred their pow-\nIn 1794 captured it again and abolished\nthe nrchliishoprlc. The congress of\nVienna ia 1S14-1S15 gave It back to\nPrussia. It figured;several times In\nthe war Just closed,, being bombarded\nby allied aerial forces.\nThe modern city of Treves occupies\nalmost the exact site of the ancient\ntown. It nestles picturesquely la the\nvalley of the Moselle river and is sur\nrounded by hills covered with the vine\nyards from which comes the famous\nMoselle wlue. The newer section con\ntains broad streets and modern build\nings. The streets In the old part are\nnarrow and crooked. .The Porta Ni\ngra, an enormous fortified gateway,\nwas built by the Romans. In the\nsoutheastern part of ihe city is the\npalace of the Roman kings, now a pic\nturesque muss of ruins. In the south\nwestern section are the Roman baths,\na vast and Impressive ruin, and a short\ndistance away Is a Roman amphithea\nter built in Emperor Trajan\'s time.\'\nFamous Church and Relics.\n. One of the most Interesting buildings\nIs the cathedral, one of the oldest\nchurches in Europe. It stands on the\nsite of a church used in the time of\nConstantine. It bears the marks of\nrepeated restorations as the result of\nwars and the ravages of time. Among\nthe1 holy relies It contains are an al\nleged uall from the cross and the fa\nmous seamless "Holy Coat," said to I\nhave been worn by the Savior. Both \'\nare held In great veneration and arei\ndeclared to have figured In many mi\nraculous healings.

Next day,\nit happened that thla same "Vendo\nnab." or "Rldes-Down-Everythlng" be\ncame the subject of a chance conver\nsation between Eugene and his old\nfriend Kinney, father of the fire-topped\nFred. The two gentlemen found them\nselves smoking in neighboring leathei\nchairs beside a broad window at the\nclub, after lunch.\nMr. Kinney had remarked that he\nexpected to get his family established\nat the seashore by the Fourth of July,\nand, following a train of thought, he\npaused and chuckled "Fourth of July\nreminds me," he said. "Have you heard\nwhat that Georgia Minafer Is doing?"\n"No, I haven\'t," said Eugene, and his\nfriend failed to notice the crispness of\nthe utterance. .. , .\n"Well, sir," Kinney chuckled again,\n"it beats the devil I My boy Fred told\nme about it yesterday. He\'s a friend\nof this young Henry Akers, son of F.\nP. Akers of the Akers Chemical com\npany. It seems this young Akers asked\nFred if he knew a fellow named Mina\nfer, because he knew Fred had always\nlived here, and young Akers had heard\nsome way that Minafer used to be an\nold family name here, and was sort of\ncurious about it Well, sir, you re\nmember this young Georgle sort of dis\nappeared, after his grandfather\'s\ndeath, and nobody seemed to know\nmuch what . had . become of him\nthough I did hear, once or twice, that\nhe was still around somewhere.

Nevertheless, Fate\'s ironic\nchoice for Oeorgie\'s undoing was not a\nbig and swift and momentous car, such\nas Eugene manufactured ; it was a spe\ncimen of the hustling little tone that\ni was flooding the country, the cheapest\ncommonest, hardiest little car ever\nmade.\nThe accident took place upon a Sun\nday morning, on a downtown crossing,\nwith the streets almost empty, and no\nreason in the world for such a thing\nto happen. He had sone out for his\nSunday morning walk, and he was\nthinking of an automobile at the very\nmoment when the little car struck\nhim"; he was thinking of a shiny lan\ndaulet and a charming figure stepping\nInto it, and of the quick" gesture of a\nwhite glove toward the chauffeur, mo\ntioning him to go on. George heard a\nshout, but did not look up, for he could\nnot Imagine anybody\'s shouting at him,\nand he was too engrossed in the ques\ntion "Was it Lucy?" He could not de\ncide, and his lack of decision In this\nmatter probably superinduced a lack\nof decision in another, more pressinglj\n.vital. At the second and louder shout\nbe did look up; and the car was almost\non him ; but fie could not make up hia\nmind if the charming little figure he\nhad seen was Lucy\'s and he could not\nmake up his mind whether to go back\nward or forward; these questions be\ncame entangled In bte mind. Then,\nstill not being able to decide which of\ntwo ways to go, he tried to go both\nand the little car ranhim down. II\nwas not moving very rapidly, but it\nwent all the way over George.\nHe was conscious of gigantic vio\nlence ; of roaring and Jolting and con\ncussion ; of choking clouds of dust,\nshot with lightning, about his head;\nhe heard snapping sounds as loud as\nshots from a small pistol, and was\nstabbed by excruciating pains in hia\nlegs. Then he became aware that th\nmachine was being lifted off of him.\nPeople were gathering in a clrcl\nround him, gabbling.\nHis forehead was bedewed with the\nsweat of anguish, and he tried to wipe\noff this dampness, but failed. He could\nnot get his arm that far. .\n"Nev" mind," a policeman said; and\nGeorge could see above his eyes tb\ndirts of the blue coat, covered with\ndust and sunshine. "Amb\'lance hers in\na minute.

George\'s drawn eyelid3 twitched;\nhis misted glance rested fleetlngly up\non the two protesting motorists, and\nthe old Imperious spirit within him\nflickered up in a single word. - Lying\non his back In the middle of the street,\nwhere he was regarded by an Increas\ning public as an unpleasant curiosity,\nhe spoke , this word clearly from a\nmouth filled with dust, and from Hps\nsmeared with blood.\nIt ws a word which Inter-\n-\nI a- fc.

What was ltf\n"\'Riffraff J"\n2Ki\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nEugene\'s feeling about George had\nnot been altered by bis talk with Kin\nney in the club window, though he waa\nsomewhat disturbed. Kinney had rep-\nj resented Georgle as a new Georgie\nat least in spots a Georgle who was\nproving that decent stuff had been hid\nin him ; in fact, a Georgie who was do\ning rather a handsome thing in taking\na risky job for the cake of his aunt,\npoor old silly Fanny Minafer ! Eugene\ndidn\'t care what risks Georgle took, or\nhow much decent stuff he had in bim ;\nnothing that Georgie would ever do in\nthis world or the next could change\nEugene Morgan\'s feeling toward him.\nIf Eugene had wished, be could eas\nily have taken George out of the nitro\nglycerin branch of tfie chemical wors.\nAlways interested in apparent impos\nsibilities of invention, Eugene had en\ncouraged many experiments in such\ngroplngs as those for the discovery of\nsubstitutes for gasoline and rubber ;\nand, though his mood had withheld the\nInformation from Kinney, be had re\ncently bought from the elder Akers a\nsubstantial quantity of stock on the\ncondition that the chemical company\nshould establish an experimental labo\nratory. He intended to buy more;\nAkers was anxious to please him ; and\na wor3 from Eugene would have\nplaced George almost anywhere in the\nchemical works. The possibility Just\nedged itself into Eugene\'s mind; that\nis, he let it become part of his percep\ntions long enough for it to prove to\nhim that it was actually a possibility.\nThen he half started with disgust that\nhe should be even idly considering\nsuch a thing over bis last cigar for the\nnight, in his library. "No I" And ha\nthrew the cigar into the empty fire\nplace and went to bed.\nHis bitterness for himself might\nhave worn away, but never his bitter\nness for Isabel. He took that thought\nto bed with him and it was true that\nEugene might not have done the odd\nthing he did that day. He was an ad\nventurer; if he had lived in the six\nteenth century he would have sauea\nthe unknown new seas, bnt having\nbeen born in the latter part of the\nnineteenth, when geography was a\nfairly well-settled matter, he had be\ncome an explorer in mechanics. Buf\nthe fact that he was a "hard-headed\nbusiness man" as well as an adven\nturer did not keep him from having a\nqueer spot in his brain, because hard\nheaded business men are as suscep\ntible to such spots as adventurers are.\nTwo weeks after Isabel\'s death, Eu\ngene was In New York on urgent busi\nness and found that the delayed ar\nrival of a steamer gave him a day with\nnothing to do. His room at the hotel\nhad become intolerable; outdoors was\nintolerable; everything was intolera\nble. It seemed to him that he must\nsee Isabel once more, hear her voice\nonce more; that he must find come\nway to her, or lose his mind. Under\nthis pressure he had gone, with com\nplete scepticism, to a "trance-medium"\nof whom he had heard wild accounts\nfrom the wife of a\' business acquaint\nance. The experience had been grotesque,\nand he came away with an encourag\ning message from his father, who had\nfailed to Identify himself satisfactor\nily, but declared that everything was\n"on a higher plane" In his pjesefft\nstate of being, and that all life was\n"continuous and progressive." Mrs.\nHorner spoke of herself as a\n"psychic ;" but otherwise "she seemed\noddly unpretentious and matter-of- j\nfact ; and Eugene had no doubt at all \'\nof her sincerity. He went to Mrs. I\nHorner\'s after his directors\' meeting\ntoday. He used the telephone booth In i\nthe directors\' room to make the ap-\npointment ; and he laughed feebly at j\nhimself, and wondered what the group i\nof men in that \' mahogany apartment \'\nwould think if they knew what he was\ndoing. Mrs. Horner Imfl changed her\naddress, but he louna the Uw one,\nand somebody purporting to be a niece\nof herstalked to him and made an ap\npoin?ment for a "sitting" at five o\'clock.\nMrs. Horner appeared in the door\nway, a wan and unenterprising look\ning woman In brown, with thin hair\nartificially waved but not recently\nand parted in the middle over a bluish\nforehead.

Well"\nShe sighed, closed her eyes, and was\nsilent, while Eugene,\' seated In the stiff\nchair across the table from her,\nwatched her profile, thought himself\nan Idiot, and called himself that and\nother names. And as the silence con\ntinued, and the Impassive woman la\nthe easy-chair remained impassive, he\nbegan to wonder what had led him to\nbe such a foot What had brought him\nback to this absurd place and caused\nEugene Thought Himself an Idiot \'\nan. takreg a nap in a Chair? in crier r\nWhat the devil did he mean by it? He\nhad not the slightest interest in Mrs.\nHorner\'s naps or in her teeth, which\nwere being slightly revealed by the un\nconscious parting of her lips, as her\nbreathing became heavier.\nHow long was he going td sit hero\npresiding over this unknown woman\'s\nslumbers? It struck him that to make\nthe picture complete he ought to be-,\nshooing flies away from her with &\npalm-leaf fan.\nMrs, Horner\'s parted Hps closed\nagain abruptly, and became com\npressed ; her shoulders moved a little,\nthen jerked repeatedly; her small\nchest heaved; she gasped, and the\ncompressed Hps relaxed to a slight\ncontortion, then began to move, whis\npering and bringing forth indistin\nguishable mutterings.\nSuddenly she spoke In a lend, husky,\nvolcej \' \'\n"Lopa Is here!"\n"Yes," Engene said dryly.
