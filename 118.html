        <pre>['AMERICAN WAR DOCUMENTS 443\nan indignant outcry from the Free \nFrench supporters of General de Gaulle, \nno doubt prompted President Roosevelt \nto make the following statement, which \nwas issued on November 17, 1942:\nI h a v e  accepted General Eisen\xad\nhower’s political arrangements made \nfor the time being in Northern and \nWestern Africa.\nI thoroughly understand and ap\xad\nprove the feeling in the United States \nand Great Britain and among all the \nother United Nations that in view of \nthe history of the past two years no \npermanent arrangement should be \nmade with Admiral Darlan. People \nin the United Nations likewise would \nnever understand the recognition of \na reconstituting of the Vichy Gov\xad\nernment in France or in any French \nterritory.\nWe are opposed to Frenchmen who \nsupport Hitler and the Axis. No one \nin our Army has any authority to dis\xad\ncuss the future Government of \nFrance and the French Empire.\nThe future French Government \nwill be established, not by any in\xad\ndividual in metropolitan France or \noverseas but by the French people \nthemselves after they have been set \nfree by the victory of the United Na\xad\ntions.\nThe present temporary arrange\xad\nment in North and West Africa is \nonly a temporary expedient, justified \nsolely by the stress of battle.\nThe present temporary arrange\xad\nment has accomplished two military \nobjectives. The first was to save \nAmerican and British lives on the \none hand, and French lives on the \nother hand.\nThe second was the vital factor of\ntime. The temporary arrangement \nhas made it possible to avoid a \n“mopping up” period in Algiers and \nMorocco which might have taken a \nmonth or two to consummate. Such \na period would have delayed the \nconcentration for the attack from the \nwest on Tunis, and we hope on \nTripoli.\nEvery day of delay in the current \noperation would have enabled the \nGermans and Italians to build up a \nstrong resistance, to dig in and make \na huge operation on our part essential \nbefore we could win. Here again, \nmany more lives will be saved under \nthe present speedy offensive than if \nwe had had to delay it for a month \nor more.\nIt will also be noted that French \ntroops, under the command of Gen\xad\neral Giraud, have already been in ac\xad\ntion against the enemy in Tunisia, \nfighting by the side of American and \nBritish soldiers for the liberation of \ntheir country.\nAdmiral Darlan’s proclamation \nassisted in making a “mopping up” \nperiod unnecessary. Temporary ar\xad\nrangements made with Admiral Dar\xad\nlan apply, without exception, to the \ncurrent local situation only.\nI have requested the liberation of \nall persons in Northern Africa who \nhad been imprisoned because they \nopposed the efforts of the Nazis to \ndominate the world, and I have asked \nfor the abrogation of all laws and \ndecrees inspired by Nazi govern\xad\nments or Nazi ideologists. Reports \nindicate that the French of North \nAfrica are subordinating all political \nquestions to the formation of a com\xad\nmon front against the common enemy.\nThe Facts on Pearl Harbor\nN ot until December 5, 1942, were the losses in ships and planes that \nthe Japanese inflicted in their attack on Pearl Harbor fully made known \nto the American public. A report given out shortly after the attack was \nadmittedly incomplete, and led to various speculations as to the full\n', '444 CURRENT HISTORY, JANUARY, 1943\nextent of the disaster. The following recital of losses, which might have \nhad a stunning effect had it been released at the outbreak of war, was \nof no comparable consequence when released by the Navy Department \ntwo days before the first anniversary of the Japanese attack. By that \ntime, American victories at Midway, in the Solomons and at Guadal\xad\ncanal had done much to lessen the impact of the news, as did, also, the \nassurance given in the text, which follows, that much of the damage \ninflicted at Pearl Harbor had already been repaired.\nTEXT OF NAVY REPORT\nOn the morning of December 7, \n1941, Japanese aircraft temporarily \ndisabled every battleship and most of \nthe aircraft in the Hawaiian area. \nOther naval vessels, both combatant \nand auxiliary, were put out of action, \nand certain shore facilities, especially \nat the Army air bases, Hickam and \nWheeler Fields, and the Naval air \nstations, Ford Island and Kaneohe \nBay, were damaged. Most of these \nships are now back with the Fleet. \nThe aircraft were all replaced within \na few days, and interference with \nfacilities was generally limited to a \nmatter of hours.\nWhen the Japanese attacked Pearl \nHarbor, two surface ship task forces \nof the Pacific Fleet were carrying out \nassigned missions at sea, and two \nsuch task forces were at their main \nbase following extensive operations \nat sea. Discounting small craft, \neighty-six ships of the Pacific Fleet \nwere moored at Pearl Harbor. In\xad\ncluded in this force were 8 battle\xad\nships, 7 cruisers, 28 destroyers and \n5 submarines. No United States air\xad\ncraft carriers were present.\nAs a result of the Japanese attack \nfive battleships, the Arizona, Okla\xad\nhoma, California, Nevada and West \nVirginia; three destroyers, the Shaw, \nCassin and Downes; the minelayer \nOglala; the target ship Utah, and a \nlarge floating drydock were either \nsunk or damaged so severely that \nthey would serve no military pur\xad\nposes for some time. In addition, \nthree battleships, the Pennsylvania,\nMaryland and Tennessee; three \ncruisers, the Helena, Honolulu and \nRaleigh, the seaplane tender Curtiss \nand the repair ship Vestal were \ndamaged.\nOf the nineteen naval vessels listed \nabove as sunk or damaged, the \ntwenty-six-year-old battleship Ari\xad\nzona will be the only one permanent\xad\nly and totally lost. Preparations for \nthe righting of the Oklahoma are \nnow in process, although final deci\xad\nsion as to the wisdom of accomplish\xad\ning this work at this time has not \nbeen made. The main and auxiliary \nmachinery, approximately SO per cent \nof the value, of the Cassin and \nDownes were saved. The other fif\xad\nteen vessels either have been or will \nbe salvaged and repaired.\nThe eight vessels described in the \nsecond sentence of paragraph three \nreturned to the Fleet months ago. A \nnumber of the vessels described in \nthe first sentence of paragraph three \nare now in full service, but certain \nothers, which required extensive ma\xad\nchinery and intricate electrical over\xad\nhauling as well as refloating and hull \nrepairing, are not yet ready for bat\xad\ntle action. Naval repair yards are \ntaking advantage of these inherent \ndelays to install numerous moderniza\xad\ntion features and improvements. To \ndesignate these vessels by name now \nwould give the enemy information \nvital to his war plans; similar in\xad\nformation regarding enemy ships \nwhich our forces have subsequently \ndamaged but not destroyed is denied \nto us.\n', 'AMERICAN WAR DOCUMENTS 445\nOn December 15, 1941, only eight \ndays after the Japanese attack and at \na time when there was an immediate \npossibility of the enemy’s coming \nback, the Secretary of the Navy an\xad\nnounced that the Arizona, Shaw, \nCassin, Downes, Utah and Oglala \nhad been lost, that the Oklahoma had \ncapsized and that other vessels had \nbeen damaged. Fortunately, the sal\xad\nvage and repair accomplishments at \nPearl Harbor have exceeded the most \nhopeful expectations.\nEighty naval aircraft of all types \nwere destroyed by the enemy. In ad\xad\ndition, the Army lost ninety-seven \nplanes on Hickam and Wheeler \nFields. Of these twenty-three were \nbombers, sixty-six were fighters and \neight were other types.\nThe most serious American losses \nwere in personnel. As result of the \nraid on December 7, 1941, 2,117 offi\xad\ncers and enlisted men of the Navy \nand Marine Corps were killed, 960 \nare still reported as missing and 876 \nwere wounded but survived. The \nArmy casualties were as follows: \n226 officers and enlisted men were \nkilled or later died of wounds; 396 \nwere wounded, most of whom have \nnow recovered and have returned to \nduty.\nAt 7:55 a .m . on December 7, 1941, \nJapanese dive-bombers swarmed over \nthe Army Air Base, Hickam Field, \nand the Naval Air Station on Ford \nIsland. A few minutes earlier the \nJapanese had struck the Naval Air \nStation at Kaneohe Bay. Bare sec\xad\nonds later enemy torpedo planes and \ndive-bombers swung in from various \nsectors to concentrate their attack on \nthe heavy ships at Pearl Harbor. The \nenemy attack, aided by the element of \nsurprise and based on exact informa\xad\ntion, was very successful.\nTorpedo planes, assisted effectively \nby dive-bombers, constituted the \nmajor threat of the first phase of the \nJapanese attack, lasting approximate\xad\nly a half hour. Twenty-one torpedo \nplanes made four attacks, and thirty \ndive-bombers came in in eight waves \nduring this period. Fifteen horizontal \nbombers also participated in this \nphase of the raid.\nAlthough the Japanese launched \ntheir initial attack as a surprise, bat\xad\ntleship ready machine guns opened \nfire at once and were progressively \naugmented by the remaining anti\xad\naircraft batteries as all hands prompt\xad\nly were called to general quarters. \nMachine guns brought down two and \ndamaged others of the first wave of \ntorpedo planes. Practically all bat\xad\ntleship anti-aircraft batteries were \nfiring within five minutes; cruisers, \nwithin an average time of four min\xad\nutes and destroyers, opening up ma\xad\nchine guns almost immediately, aver\xad\naged seven minutes in bringing all \nanti-aircraft guns into action.\nFrom 8:25 to 8:40 a .m . there was \na comparative lull in the raid, al\xad\nthough air activity continued with \nsporadic attack by dive and horizon\xad\ntal bombers. This respite was termi\xad\nnated by the appearance of horizon\xad\ntal bombers, which crossed and re\xad\ncrossed their targets from various \ndirections and caused serious dam\xad\nage. While the horizontal bombers \nwere continuing their raids, Japanese \ndive-bombers reappeared, probably \nbeing the same ones that had partici\xad\npated in earlier attacks; this phase, \nlasting about a half hour, was devoted \nlargely to strafing. All enemy air\xad\ncraft retired by 9 :45 a .m .\nPrior to the Japanese attack 202 \nUnited States naval aircraft of all \ntypes on the Island of Oahu were in \nflying condition, but 150 of these \nwere permanently or temporarily \ndisabled by the enemy’s concentrated \nassault, most of them in the first few \nminutes of the raid. Of the fifty-two \nremaining naval aircraft, thirty-eight \ntook to the air on December 7, 1941,\n', '446 CURRENT HISTORY, JANUARY, 1943\nthe other fourteen being ready too \nlate in the day or being blocked from \ntake-off positions. Of necessity, \ntherefore, the Navy was compelled to \ndepend on anti-aircraft fire for its \nprimary defensive weapon, and this \ncondition exposed the Fleet to contin\xad\nuous air attack.\nBy coincidence, eighteen scout \nbombing planes from a United States \naircraft carrier en route arrived at \nPearl Harbor during the raid. These \nare included in the foregoing figures. \nFour of these scout bombers were \nshot down, thirteen of the remaining \nfourteen taking off again in search of \nthe enemy. Seven patrol planes were \nin the air when the attack started.\nThere was a total of 273 Army \nplanes on the Island of Oahu on \nDecember 7, 1941. Very few of these \nwere able to take off because of the \ndamage to the runways at Hickam \nand Wheeler Fields.\nIt is difficult to determine the total \nnumber of enemy aircraft participa\xad\nting in the raid, but careful analysis\nof all reports makes it possible to esti\xad\nmate the number as twenty-one tor\xad\npedo planes, forty-eight dive bombers \nand thirty-six horizontal bombers, \ntotaling 105 of all types. Undoubtedly \ncertain fighter planes also were pres\xad\nent, but these are not distinguished \nby types and are included in the \nabove figures.\nThe enemy lost twenty-eight air\xad\ncraft due to Navy action, and the \nArmy pursuit planes that were able to \ntake off shot down more than twenty \nJapanese planes. In addition, three \nsubmarines, of forty-five tons each \nwere accounted for.\nThe damage suffered by the United \nStates Pacific Feet as result of the \nJapanese attack on December 7, 1941, \nwas most serious, but the repair job \nnow is nearly completed, and thanks \nto the inspired and unceasing efforts \nof the naval and civilian personnel \nattached to the various repair yards, \nespecially at Pearl Harbor itself, this \ninitial handicap soon will be erased \nforever.\nFor o Free World\nF rom many quarters come urgent demands that peace be planned in \nadvance of an armistice. This plea has been prominent in the recent \naddresses of Wendell L. Willkie, as exemplified in his first report to \nthe American people after his return from travels abroad (for complete \ntext see Current H istory for December). That the United States \nDepartment of State is itself committed to the policy of a peace planned \nin advance of an armistice is shown by the two documents that follow.\nSUMNER WELLES ON PEACE\nIt is sometimes alleged that in its \npreoccupation with winning the war, \nthe Administration is content to de\xad\nscribe post-war aims in general and \nvague terms. A contrary impression \nwas afforded in an address delivered \nby Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of \nState, on November 17, 1942, before \nthe Forum oh Current Problems of \nThe New York Herald Tribune. A sig\xad\nnificant portion of this address is given \nbelow. (For the complete text see the\nHerald Tribune, November 18, or the \nDepartment of State Bulletin, Novem\xad\nber 21.) It will be seen in the follovnng \nexcerpt that Mr. Welles pleads for the \nremoval of suspiciotis rivalries, the \nclarification of goals, and the reaching \nof agreements before an armistice is \nsigned.\nI n the fundamentals of international \nrelationships there is nothing more \nfatally dangerous than the common \nAmerican fallacy that the formula\xad\ntion of an aspiration is equivalent to\n']</pre>
