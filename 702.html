        <pre>['Rome reaped the fruits of destroying\nCarthage; but in a split-second atomic\nwar, two Carthages might perish and\nno Rome survive. So, in this strange\nand terrible way, the prophecy might\nyet be fulfilled that the meek shall inherit\nthe earth.\nThe Second Labour Rebellion\nTheSecondLab urR ellion\nSaturday, 5 April 1947, Weekly News Commentary on Current International Issues,\n9.15pm 2BL\nWhen I spoke to you last November on the Labour rebellion in Britain, 58 Labour\nmembers had moved a vital foreign policy amendment to the King’s speech, and\nanother hundred supported the rebels by abstention.\nThe Labour government’s security in office depended in November on the congeniality\nof its foreign policy to the Tories. This week, in a second sensational\nrebellion, this time on the conscription issue, no less than 72 Labourites voted\nagainst the government, and 30 to 40 others abstained.\nTalk of disciplining the rebels has\nfaded; instead the government yesterday\nissued an amendment reducing\nfrom 18 months to 12 months the proposed\nperiod of service.\nNot all the rebels are attacking the\ngovernment’s foreign policy; some\nthink that an economically desperate\nBritain cannot spare manpower for\npeacetime armies; others, with\nChurchill, think the army is wastefully\nrun. But this much is clear—the government’s\nforeign policy is not gaining support. And this raises acutely the\nproblem that the Labour government cannot sell its own foreign policy to its own\nparty.\nThe difficulty of the problem lies, I think, in this—that British foreign policy\ntoday can be fully understood only against the background of the Soviet–American\nstruggle, which becomes daily more open. Her foreign policy is her attitude to this\nstruggle.\n68\n', 'I have often in these talks examined particular conflicts between Russia and\nAmerica. We must go deeper tonight. We must try and stand off from this world\nas if at the moment when hostilities ceased in 1945, and examine the alternative\npatterns of world power then emerging. We must try and see what each of these\npatterns would imply; then looking at the world today, ask ourselves which pattern\nseems to be working itself out. You will remember that, at the time, I questioned\nthe solidity of many of the easy optimisms then current. I may have shocked some\nidealists among you, but it was the idealist in me that drove me to it. Looking back\nnow, it must be apparent to all of us, despite all the talk and make-believe, that\nwhat faced us in 1945 was not a world of peace of equality between states, nor even\na world of power politics in the old sense with several Great Powers competing to\nmaintain a balance.\nWe were facing rather a two-power world, a bipolar world. The American\ncolossus and the Soviet colossus divided the world, in at least potential domination.\nAll nations and all issues were entangled in this stark fact.\nIt has not been impossible in the past for a two-power world to be at peace for\nlong periods. But our 1945 world differs from anything before. It is a global world,\nin which the prize of domination is to inherit the earth. It is a world moving to\nglobal destructive weapons, notably to atomic weapons. It is a world, moreover,\nin which the destroying power must count the chance of being itself destroyed.\nRome reaped the fruits of destroying Carthage; but in a split-second atomic war,\ntwo Carthages might perish and no Rome survive. So, in this strange and terrible\nway, the prophecy might yet be fulfilled that the meek shall inherit the earth.\nMany folk, in 1945, thought that because modern communications have\nshrunk the size of the world, and because technological advance has assimilated\nthe lives and institutions of men of all nations, therefore peace was more likely. But\nin 1945, as now, that was only a utopian possibility. The real alternatives in 1945\nwere these.\nFirst, if America really had the monopoly of the atomic weapons, we might\nhave expected that Soviet insistence on her position as the other colossus would\nlead to American agitation for a preventive war. That is, for a war to prevent the\nSoviet Union doing in the future what America was equipped to do at present.\nThere is evidence of this pattern of policy in America today, as when, this week,\nex-Ambassador-to-Moscow William C Bullitt Jr declared that if Russia had had the\natomic bomb she would already have used it on the United States. The inferential\nadvice was that America should have a showdown with Russia, while America still\nalone has the atom bomb. Naval and military leaders have used similar language.\nBut, of course, America could not be absolutely sure of her monopoly, and there\nare other frightful weapons besides the bomb. And the morale of her armies, and\nthe state of public opinion might, in any case, have prevented her acting before the\nSoviet Union began to make atom bombs.\nAnd so, peering forward from 1945 we would have to envisage a second possible\npattern, the pattern of weapon parity.\nThe Second Labour Rebellion\n69\n', 'With weapon parity, the only sensible arrangement, even from the point of\nview of naked power, would be agreed international control. Once this were attained,\nwe could look forward to an era of peace and developing civilisation. Its\nattainment, however, against the background of prevailing taboos and bogeys in\nAmerica and the Soviet Union, was a problem.\nFor to attain it, the Soviet Union would have to disclose her preparedness before\nshe knew America’s. The Soviet Union, if she were ill-prepared, would fear\nthat preventive war circles in America might carry the day, if it were known she\nwas ill-prepared. Conversely, America would have to disclose her strength while\nstill uncertain of the Soviet armoury. And, all the time, powerful elements in both\ncountries would be working to frustrate agreement.\nSo that the only sensible course might well fail, and we will have weapon parity\nwithout agreement, instead of either the pattern of preventive war, and the pattern\nof international control. Each side would be facing the peril of split-second attack.\nEach would tend to degenerate into a garrison state. For instance, in America, we\nwould expect domination of civilian government by military figures. Notice now\nthat even the Secretary of State is now a general. We would expect huge appropriations\nwithout Congressional control of spending. Notice lately the complete\nexecutive discretion as to the dollar aid for Greece and Turkey. We would expect an\nattack on trade union activity in the name of national defence. (That, too, is under\nway.) We would expect hysterical purges of scientists, civil servant and teachers in\nthe name of national security. (Notice that even observers antipathetic to the Soviet\nUnion regard the present purge in America as ‘a weird and wonderful witch-hunt’\n(Don Iddon, in Sun, 3 April).\nSuch witch-hunts express sincere fear, but they also serve to whip up public\nopinion to support the garrison state and swollen defence budgets. This last, then,\nmay be the power pattern, which is gaining reality. Must Soviet–American war result?\nNot necessarily, as long, at any rate, as the national leaders can control the\nsituation they create. The likelihood of destruction of both sides, especially when\nlinked with the precedent of the war crimes trials, are real deterrents. Each colossus\nand its leaders have too much to lose. Conceivably, the very impossibility of\nmaintaining high popular tension indefinitely from year to year, and the settling\ndown of each power within its sphere, might gradually lead back to sanity and cooperation.\nBut the more disastrous outcome is at least, possible.\nIn this light it is easy to understand why discussions on foreign policy, particularly\nin Britain and France, cut so sharply across Labour party lines. On particular\nissues America or the Soviet Union may be supported, but the deeper issue of a\ntwo-power world does not capture French or British sympathy. From their point of\nview world domination by one power is repugnant, whether that power be America\nor the Soviet Union. Must they, on principle or by strategic necessity, still pick\none side or the other? Perhaps there lies the final question, which is splitting British\nLabour.\nLetters to Australia: Volume 2\n70\n']</pre>
