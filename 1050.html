        <pre>['. . . the most fundamental principle\nof justice in a democratic society is\nprocedural—the principle that society\nshall be so organised that men’s felt\nwants and views of what is good can\nbe freely expressed, and compete for\npolitical support.\nBig States, Little States, Beggarmen and\nThieves\nBigStates,LittleggarmenandThieves\nSaturday, 3 August 1946, Weekly News Commentary on Current International\nIssues, 9.05pm 2FC\nThe central issue of the battle of procedure which broke out at the Paris Conference\nthis week was, in Dr Evatt’s words, ‘whether the sponsoring powers would be\nprepared to hear their co-belligerents, not (merely) as supplicants, advocates and\nconsultants, but as partners who had proved their worth in the struggle against enemies.’\nThe role which Dr Evatt has assumed,\nis one which may serve an important\nfunction in the present phase of international\nrelations, even if, as seems\nlikely from tonight’s reports, his efforts\nprove to be in vain. Let me try and explain\nwhy.\nWe are all familiar, I think, with\nthe importance of Protestantism in the\nhistory of Western civilisation. Now,\nwhatever sect you think has the true\ndoctrine, and even if you think that\nnone of them have it, the movement of dissent and protest which asserts the independence\nof human judgment, and its inherent moral right to arrive at its own\nconclusions—Protestantism in the broadest sense—has had incalculable effects. It\nis a constant, recurring challenge to the absolute claims of power, and to the absolute\npower of prejudice.\nI think it is essentially as a movement of protest that the true significance of Dr\nEvatt’s veto fight at San Francisco and on the Security Council, and his stand this\nweek, are to be assessed. Many of us are impatient when these important international\nconferences get bogged down so regularly in procedure. ‘Why,’ we ask, ‘don’t\nthe statesmen forget the technicalities and get down to the real business.’\n237\n', 'But there is procedure and procedure. Some matters of procedure are mere\ntechnicalities. But others go so much to the heart of the business as to determine\nthe very nature of a community and all it does. I myself would tend to say, for example,\nthat the most fundamental principle of justice in a democratic society is\nprocedural—the principle that society shall be so organised that men’s felt wants\nand views of what is good can be freely expressed, and compete for political support.\nYet, at bottom, this is merely a rule of procedure; it does not tell you who\nshould have what and how much. And it is embodied, significantly enough, in each\nof draft peace treaties before the present conference.\nYou will perhaps see now the linkage I am suggesting between Protestantism\nin the broad (and, of course, non-religious) sense, and the kind of procedural issue\nwhich Dr Evatt is fighting at Paris. That issue goes right back, as Dr Evatt stressed\non Thursday, to the Potsdam Agreement of exactly a year ago. That agreement provided,\nyou may remember, for a Council of Foreign Ministers of the Great Powers\n‘to continue the necessary preparatory work for the peace settlements’. There was\nno provision in the agreement for a full peace conference of all the belligerents.\nAt the very first meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in September last\nyear, Dr Evatt voiced a protest on this account. Then at the Moscow Conference\nlast Christmas, the Great Power foreign ministers agreed that, when preparation of\nthe present treaties was completed, the Council of Foreign Ministers would convoke\na conference for the purpose of ‘considering’ and making ‘recommendations’\nas to draft treaties, after which the big powers would draw up the final texts. This\nstill left it in doubt whether, in Dr Evatt’s words, the conference was to be a formality\nor a reality.\nIt is at this point that Dr Evatt’s protest against the big power dominance,\nas seen in the Great Power veto on the Security Council, joined with his protest\nagainst peace conference procedure. As to the veto, you will recall, his crusade culminated\nafter the recent Security Council meeting in his raising the whole veto\nquestion for the next meeting of the General Assembly. And Dr Evatt apparently\nviewed the attempt by the big four to lay down certain rules of procedure for the\npresent conference as a threat to introduce the veto there, by a back door. Let us see\nwhy. The big four recommended that each of the five peace treaties should be considered\nby separate committees, consisting of those states which had been at war\nagainst the particular enemy, and that for decisions of substance in each of these\ncommittees, as well as in the full conference, a two-thirds majority was to be required.\nThe procedure committee of the conference has already adopted most of\nthe big power proposals. The two-thirds rule is the main snag.\nNow this would not have been so very important had all the conferring states\nbeen at war with all the enemy states, as is the case with Italy. Altogether, 21 states\nare involved, and so the pro-Soviet group of six states could not alone block decisions.\nBut to the other four enemies the belligerents do not exceed 12, the Soviet\ngroup in each case constituting a third. Here, therefore, on the general assumption\nthat the group will vote solidly, Dr Evatt might well detect a slightly disguised form\nLetters to Australia: Volume 2\n238\n', 'of Great Power veto—instead of a legal veto of a single state, a de facto veto operating\nthrough the two-thirds majority rule.\nThat is why he declared before the procedure committee on Wednesday that\nunless the requirement of a two-thirds majority was dropped ‘practically nothing\nof importance will go before the Foreign Ministers Council from this conference’.\nThat too, is why an attempt was reported yesterday in the procedure committee to\nput all the 21 states on each of the committees. That would have destroyed the de\nfacto veto even if the two-thirds rule remained. That proposal failed by 11 votes\nto nine with one abstention, and it is to be noted that not only the Soviet, but the\nUnited Kingdom representative as well, opposed it.\nThat brings me to a most vital aspect of the Australian position, which can easily\nbe overlooked. In European affairs, Dr Evatt’s protestant challenge has usually\nbrought him up against the Soviet delegate, and the press this week featured the\nEvatt–Molotov aspect. But the British vote that I have just mentioned hints that\nthis may not be wholly the case even for Europe; and indeed on some basic questions,\nlike policy towards Franco’s Spain, Dr Evatt has tended if anything to the\nSoviet rather than the Anglo–American side.\nWhat is certainly clear, is that this same protestant challenge has, in the Pacific,\nled the Australian government into chronic opposition to various American policies,\nnotably as to the machinery whereby policy for Japan is to be worked out, and\nas to how bases are to be disposed of, and as to security arrangements generally.\nAnd this is perfectly consistent with the principle, for in the East it is the United\nStates that feels the strength of her own de facto position, just as the Soviet Union\ndoes in Europe. And the United States there, like the Soviet Union in Europe, is\nreluctant to permit that position to be disturbed by admitting what Dr Evatt calls\nthe ‘equal rank and voice’ of all the belligerent nations.\nThe greater responsibility of the big states for the maintenance of peace is, of\ncourse, bound to be reflected in the peacemaking; no protest can abolish the basic\nframework of power within which international relations are set. Yet the function\nof protest is a vital one, to keep active the world’s sense of moral responsibility.\nThe favourable and worldwide press for the Australian stand is thus not due\nmerely to the spectacular Molotov–Evatt exchange. It proceeds also from two other\nsources. One is the fact that, in Europe, the stand operates mainly against the Soviet\nUnion. The other is the appeal that this stand makes to postwar realism, which\nhas been so frustrated in the last year.\nThe issue then is whether, because there are big states and little states, the little\nones must be merely beggarmen, without rights, supplicants in Dr Evatt’s words,\nand the big ones thieves, by which I mean of course, each a moral law unto itself.\nThat is why I thought we ought to talk together tonight about ‘big states, little\nstates, beggarmen and thieves.’\nBig States, Little States, Beggarmen and Thieves\n239\n']</pre>
