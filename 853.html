By CHARLES L.\nSTOODLEY, F.F.A., Secretary and Actuary of the City of\nGlasgow Friendly Society.\n[Read before the Faculty, 14th February 1938. A Synopsis\nof the Paper will be found on p. 332.]\nMUCH of the discussion at the Meetings of the Institute and\nthe Faculty on the Al924-29 Tables (" Mortality of Assured Lives,\n1924-1929," Extracts and Discussions) centred on the question of\nthe wisdom of having constructed those Tables from the combined\nWhole of Life and Endowment Assurance Experiences in the face\nof the materially different rates of mortality shown in the two\nclasses, and this same question assumed a certain prominence in\nthe discussions on the paper " Some Points that have arisen out\nof the Continuous Investigation into the Mortality of Assured Lives "\nsubmitted to the Institute and the Faculty in the early part of 1936\nby Messrs. Elderton, Oakley and Smither.\nNo useful purpose would be served in attempting to revive this\nquestion directly, although it is obviously difficult to avoid some\nreference to it in a paper which is concerned with the cognate\nquestion of the possible influences which operate to produce the\nmarkedly different rates of mortality as between the two classes.\nThe fundamental reasons, apart from the reason of expediency,\nwhich led to the construction of a composite table were apparently:—\n(a) That as between one group of offices and another there\nwere indications from the statistics that the mortality\nmight vary quite as much as between one class of policy\nand another.\n(b) That if separate tables were constructed they would in all\nprobability not both be used in practice, and that it was\nVOL. xvi. 2 E. XVI.  \n', '316 Whole of Life and\nno worse to combine all the classes than to make a table\nof one class and then use it for every purpose.\n(c) That the difference in mortality as between the various\nclasses might not be stable and might be due to factors\nquite independent of the particular type of policy.\nAs regards (a), the fact that the endowment assurance rates of\nmortality in one office or group of offices were higher than the whole\nlife rates of another does not appear to me to constitute a particularly\nstrong argument against separation, always provided that any tables\nconstructed from the separate experiences were accepted not as\nstandards, but as being merely representations of the average\nmortality of the contributing offices for all the sub-classes included.\nThe data in the separate classes would certainly not be less homogeneous\nthan the combined data.\nIt is with argument (c) that this paper is chiefly concerned, and\nin order to assess the degree of difference in rates of mortality due\nto type of assurance I have attempted to eliminate the independent\nfactors referred to, such as temporary selection and year of entry\ninfluence.\nOn the question of class rates of mortality the Committee state\nin the Introduction to the "Mortality of Assured Lives, 19241929,"\np. xiii.: " As regards durations \' 5 and over\' the endowment\nassurance mortality is still, generally speaking, lighter than that\nof the whole life classes, but without profit business shows, if anything,\na lighter mortality than with profit business. An explanation\nof the difference may be that the without profit business was put\non the books at a more recent date, and a similar explanation may\naccount, to a certain extent, for the difference between the endowment\nassurance and whole life mortality. That explanation would\nhold good either if selection is associated with date of entry\ncombined with generally improving mortality on passing from\nremote to more recent entry dates, or if temporary selection holds\nfor a longer period than five years."\nIf it were assumed for purposes of argument that temporary\nselection persisted for a longer period than five years and/or that\nyear of entry influence existed and, further, that the select rates\nof mortality in the two classes were identical throughout for the\nsame status, then the ultimate rates of mortality would only be\nidentical if the distributions of the exposed to risk as to age and\nduration were also identical. This condition as to identity of\ndistribution does not hold, and it appeared to me that it would\nbe of special interest to examine the incidence and direction of\n', 'Endowment Assurance Mortality 317\npossible differences between the ultimate rates of mortality in the\ntwo classes on the basis of approximations to the normal distributions\nof the exposed to risk and on the hypothesis of common\nrates of mortality varying with each change in status.\nThe solution of this problem required the determination of values\nof in the expression for the ultimate or truncated\nrate of mortality\nwhere represents the proportion of the total exposed (durations\n3 and over) at duration t and\nValues of and were available from the statistics, but an\nexamination of the trend of the exposed to risk (Volume of Statistics,\np. 675) indicated that these values could not be used without\nmodification.\nThe total exposed for each of the durations 0 to 3 inclusive\nappeared to follow a normal course of progressive decrease, but as\nbetween durations 3 and 4 there was what appeared to be an\nabnormal increase. The conclusion was arrived at that this feature\ncould be associated with the large influx of business in the immediate\npost-war years 1919-20. The exposed to risk for durations 3 and 4\nwere therefore modified on the broad assumption that the mean\nnew business of the contributing offices in the relevant years was\na microcosm of the whole. An adjustment was introduced on the\nbasis of the proportions of exposed to risk in order to allow for the\nincidence of the Additional Offices contributing from the year 1927.\nWhere Nt represents the number of new assurances for year t\n(Board of Trade Returns) and the reciprocal\nweights were ascertained as follows :—\nThe reciprocal weights of ·958 and 1·019 arrived at by this process\nwere assumed to be uniform for the four age groups in each of the\ntwo separate classes forming the subject of my investigation. It may\nbe added that it was found upon examination that over the five\ndurations 0,1 . . . . .4 the ratio of the endowment assurance exposed\n(and therefore the whole life exposed) to the combined exposed was\n', '318 Whole of Life and\nto all intents and purposes constant. No alternative to the assumption\nof uniform modification of business according to age appeared\npossible, but I do not think the assumption can be far removed\nfrom fact.\nWhere represents the exposed to risk for durations " 3 and\nover in respect of age group the values of and are therefore\nand\nThe values of for and over were arrived at by assuming\nto be a third degree function of t, the coefficients being determined\nfrom the following series of equations :—\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nwhere z= (higher limiting age of group—18), the assumption being\nthat 15 circa was the youngest age at entry.\nIn the case of certain of the age groups, negative values of\narose as t approached z. These negative values were eliminated\nand the preceding positive values reduced proportionately in order\nto preserve the condition that the area enclosed by the curve\nshould be unity.\nValues of for the four decennial age groups 20½-29½, 30½-39½,\n40½-49½ and 50½ to 59½ are given graphically on the opposite\npage. It will be observed that for the first two age groups the\nwhole life exposed is proportionately greater than the corresponding\nendowment assurance exposed over the early durations but the\nposition is reversed for the final groups.\nThe determination of suitable values of presented some\ndifficulty as the irregularity in the values available for durations\nunder 5 made it impossible to approach the problem with any degree\nof confidence by the direct and obvious method of extrapolation.\nThe method I eventually adopted had as its basis the ultimate\nor truncated aggregate rates of mortality in respect of duration 0\nand over (aggregate), durations 1 and over etc. up to durations 5\nand over. The four decennial groups comprised in the range\n', 'Endowment Assurance Mortality 319\nGRAPH OF\nWHOLE LIFE\nENDOWMENT ASSURANCE\n', '320 Whole of Life and\n20½ to 59½ were operated upon, and the ultimate rates of mortality\nfor these age groups are given in the following table :—\nTABLE A\nValues of (Combined Data)\nIt will be observed that the first differences of the last four values\nin each column tend to be constant, and it appeared reasonable to\nassume from this that would proceed throughout by constant\nfirst differences\nThe values of adopted were 5, 5, 5 and 9 for the respective\nage groups.\nFrom the values of obtained by the process already described,\nvalues of\nwere next obtained, whence by successive subtraction from\nthe truncated aggregate exposed to risk, excluding 4, 5, 6 and so\non . . . years were obtained.\nThe corresponding deaths were then ascertained by use of the\nappropriate The successive differencing of these truncated\naggregate deaths gave the deaths for each duration, and these in\nassociation with the corresponding exposed to risk yielded the\n" select " rates of mortality contained in the following table :—\n', 'Endowment Assurance Mortality 321\nTABLE B\nValues of (Combined Data)\n', '322 Whole of Life and\nThe method described above of arriving at values of\nmust necessarily reproduce the actual deaths and by reason of its\nmathematical foundation produce a quasi graduated series.\nWith the truncated aggregate or ultimate rate of mortality\nincreasing with t it followed that would also increase.\nThe assumption of a continuous change in with t will\npossibly be open to some criticism, but on the facts available the\ncourse I have adopted appeared to be the most appropriate,\nparticularly as the whole investigation must proceed on relative\nrather than absolute lines. Moreover, the assumption of a continuous\nincrease in with t will, in view of the distribution\nof the exposed to risk in the two classes, tend to minimise rather\nthan exaggerate any difference between the class rates of mortality\ndue to factors other than temporary selection or year of entry\ninfluence.\nThe criterion of the symmetry of the curve of mortality need\nnot be stressed, but the following graphs comparing the official\nmethod rates with the select rates for age group 40½ to 49½ will\nbe of interest:—\n', 'Endowment Assurance Mortality 323\nThe first differences of vary from ·00009 to ·00005, and\nit is an interesting and feasible speculation that this small variation\nin the select rates from duration 5 can be attributed to year of\nentry influence.\nBy projecting the curve from duration 5 to duration 0 on the\nbasis of constant first differences of ·00009 and fitting a third degree\ncurve to the unadjusted select rates for durations 0 to 4 we obtain\nthe following measure of temporary selection :—\nTurning now to the main object of the paper, the determination\nof the extent to which the distributions of the exposed in the two\nexperiences affect the ultimate rates of mortality, the select rates\nof mortality given in Table B were used in association with the\nDuration\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nGraduated\nBates\n•00299\n•00393\n•00436\n•00456\n•00478\nTemporarj\nSelection\n•00147\n•00062\n•00028\n•00017\n•00004\n', '324 Whole of Life and\nappropriate values of to arrive at the ultimate rates given in\nthe following table :—\nTABLE C\nComparison of Ultimate Rates of Mortality\nIt will be observed that the different distributions of the exposed\nto risk account to a degree for the differences between the actual\nultimate mortality rates of the two classes. The balances of the\nactual differences, which may be said to constitute a measure of\nthe effect of influences other than temporary selection and year\nof entry influence, are however relatively substantial.\nThe conclusion cannot be avoided from these results that there\nis in operation a definite, if unconscious, class selection by proposers\nand that a substantial proportion of the differences between\nthe rates of mortality in the two classes is attributable to the\ninfluence of this selection. If confirmation of this conclusion were\nnecessary, it could be found to a striking extent in a comparison\nbetween the mortality in the two sections over the early years of\nassurance. Taking the Original Offices, With Profit, Medically\nExamined Data, and using the unadjusted combined data five-age\ngroup mortality rates as a basis, it will be found that for the first\nthree years of assurance the comparative figures for whole life and\nendowment assurance mortality (on the basis of actual and expected\ndeaths) are 100 : 96 for ages 20½-44½ and 100 : 85 for ages 45½-69½.\nThe data being contemporaneous, year of entry influence does not\nenter into consideration, and it can therefore be asserted that the\ndifferences exhibited arise from some other cause, and that cause is\nobviously the degree of selection exercised by proposers against the\noffice in the choice of the type of contract.\n', "Endowment Assurance Mortality 325\nGRADUATION OF EXPERIENCES\nHaving reached this conclusion it appeared to me that, from a\ntheoretical point of view at any rate, it would be desirable and\ninstructive to carry the investigation further and to obtain graduated\nultimate rates of mortality (durations 3 and over) for the two sections.\nThe data constituting the basis of the investigation were these\nemployed in the construction of the Official Table, and to obtain\nthe data in respect of each of the two classes involved the somewhat\nonerous task of extracting the relative particulars from the\nVolume of Statistics.\nUnadjusted values of were obtained in the usual\nway (the suffixes W and E denoting whole life and endowment\nassurance respectively) for each value of x. These unadjusted\nvalues could have been graduated independently by the same\nsummation method as that employed in the graduation of the\nOfficial Table or by any other method, but it appeared to me that\nany graduation of the separate class experiences without reference\nto the published combined experience would be of little practical\nuse and interest.\nIt may be of interest, however, to mention that my initial\nexperiments in the matter of graduation, based on the ultimate\ndata, durations 5 and over, led me to the conclusion that the\nwhole life and endowment assurance mortality could be expressed\nby the following curves :—\nwhere is a value common to both curves and assumes its\ninitial absolute value at a point beyond the range of ages covered\nby the endowment assurance section.\nThe function and the constant c being common to both curves\nwe have for ages up to 70\nwhence by integration\nAlthough this line of enquiry produced such an interesting and\nelegant expression it was not pursued further for the reason\nalready stated.\nThe following Table D gives the unadjusted group rates of\nmortality in the two classes, and a comparison is made between\nand\nфx ф'x\nфx\n", '326 Whole of Life and\nthese rates and the unadjusted rates derived from the combined\nexperiences:—\nTABLE D\nValues of\nA superficial examination of the trend of the values indicated\nthat an expression similar to that employed by me in connecting\nthe OM and OM(5) rates of mortality (vide T.F.A., xv. p. 30) might\nyield successful results in the case of the endowment assurance\nexperience.\nIt was found that the following expression for\nwith c= 1·1914 and a=6,000,000 gave a reasonably good fit over\nthe whole range of ages. Values of it is to be added, were\nobtamed by use of the relation cologe\nSo far as the whole life experience was concerned it was observed\nthat the values formed an almost symmetrical frequency\ncurve, and after many experiments it was found that a curve\nof the form\ncould be fitted with a high degree of fidelity, the values of the\nconstants being c=l·1914 and A=l·0155.\n', 'Endowment Assurance Mortality 327\nThere is, it will be observed, the remarkable coincidence that the\nvalue of the constant c= 1·1914 is common to both experiences.\nIn Table G, appearing on page 331, a comparison is made between\nthe actual and expected deaths, and a comparison is also given\nbetween the combined deviations and the deviations produced by\nthe Official Table for the combined experiences.\nOver the range 20½-79½ the combination of the separate graduations\nshows a net excess of expected over actual deaths of 196\neompared with 83 by the official graduation of the combined\nexperiences.\nFrom the nature of the method of graduation adopted, it was\nto be expected that my results would show the same features as\nthe official graduation, and it is of extreme interest to note that\nthe comparatively wide deviations in the age groups 40½-44½ and\n45½-49½ can be traced to the endowment assurance section of the\nexpenence and that the large deviation in the age group 65½-69½\narises, contrary to expectation, in the whole life section.\nFrom the expression for\nwe have by integration\nwhence\nSimilarly, by integrating the expression for\nwe obtain\nleading to\nwhere and is calculated at rate j where\nThe calculation of actuarial functions on the basis of the endowment\nassurance rates of mortality resolves itself therefore into a\nsimple blending of functions at two different uniform rates of interest\non the basis of the official combined rates of mortality.\nWhile the expression for does not lead to this convenient\n', '328 Whole of Life and\ncondition, the calculation of the and columns is both\nsimple and straightforward,\nThe same process might be considered even more expedient in\nthe case of the endowment assurance than the blending process\nsince that process involves values of functions at rates of interest\nnot included in the published tables.\nFrom the expressions for and we have\nleading to\nThese expressions, which have been given merely to complete\nthe scheme of inter-relation between the three experiences, are\nperhaps of more academic than practical interest.\nIn the following table a comparison is made between the rates of\nmortality in the three sections at quinquennial ages:—\nAs examples of monetary values based on the sectional rates of\nmortality, I give in the following Table F values of life and temporary\nannuities along with corresponding reversion functions.\nTABLE E\ni.e. and\n', 'Endowment Assurance Mortality 329\nTABLE F\nax and Ax at 3% Interest\nand Interest\nThis table and the preceding table speak for themselves.\nIt is to be pointed out in conclusion that my scheme of graduation,\nwith its underlying object of establishing mathematical relations\nat 3°/\n', '330 Whole of Life and\nbetween the sectional rates and the official combined rates, demanded\nthat-the data used in the construction of the Official Table should be\nused simpliciter in the construction of the sectional tables.\nFor this reason no adjustment was made in the data in the\nlight of the information contained in the paper " Some Points that\nhave arisen out of the Continuous Investigation into the Mortality\nof Assured Lives, 1924-29," by Messrs.

K. Granger.—I would like, in the first place, to congratulate Mr.\nStoodley on the ingenuity of the methods used in this paper and on the\nclear manner in which they have been set out. I would also thank him\nfor the immense amount of work that it has obviously entailed. He has,\nhowever, to-night done three things: he has scientifically and emphatically\nanswered the question that he propounded ; he has also answered a second\nquestion that he has not propounded; and he has propounded a question\nthat he has not answered. The author has, I think, clearly proved that the\nlighter mortality experienced by the Endowment Assurance Class has not\nbeen due to their more recent selection (which involves the year of their\nentry) but that that class has really experienced a lower mortality than\nthe combined table and therefore one assumes considerably lower than the\nWhole Life Class. This man of straw was, I think, set up by the Joint\nCommittee, but whether by them or by the author himself, he has most\neffectively knocked it down. He has, in fact, proved that the mortality\nof endowment assurances and that of whole life assurances are as oil and\nwater and that no attempt should ever have been made to mix them.\nWe have been clearly warned that the A1924-29 Table should not be\ntaken as in any way prophetic, while Sir W. P. Elderton stated that he\nwould not recommend, for a valuation, any office adjusting the rates in\nthe light of their own history as that would mean in effect valuing by its\nown experience. What is the A1924-29 Table but the history of six years\nduring which a broth of heterogeneous human ingredients were exposed\nto the risk of death ? History, however, is only of antiquarian interest\nunless from it we can foretell the future, and only when an office has on\nits books the same ingredients in the same proportions can it reasonably\nexpect to suffer the rates of mortality there exhibited, and then, of course,\nsubject to there being no war and no serious epidemic. The extent of the\nwant of homogeneity among some of the ingredients is measured in this\npaper. I t would thus appear that the A1924-29 Table should only be used\nwith the greatest care except when combined with such a reduction in\nthe rate of interest that the premiums are not reduced nor the reserves\nmade less stringent. In the case, particularly, of valuation of liabilities\nwhere there exists a large amount of vested bonus, the reserves at the\nsame rate of interest by the New Tables may well be less than by the OM\neven although the factor nVx is similar in both tables.\nThe author has also clearly proved in Table B that the effect of selection\nlasts considerably more than three years. I t should be noted that the\nrate he gives for the truncated table, three years and over, is presumably\nmade up by combining the rates of mortality, whereas the A1924-29\nTable was developed from combining the experience. Now, in the latter\ncase, had a truncated table been formed excluding the first four years,\ndoubtless it would have shown very little variation from the published\nultimate table, for in the latter table the lower mortality experienced in\nthe fourth year would have little or no effect in reducing the rate\nof mortality when the experience of those exposed through that year\nwas merged with the great weight of the mass who were exposed in later\nyears. I t would therefore seem that the author's methods are more\nsuitable than that of forming truncated tables excluding 3, 5 or 10 years\n", "334 Whole of Life and\nfor establishing the number of years through which, in the final tables,\nthe effects of selection should be shown.\nLastly, I would deal with query (6) on the first page of the paper, and\nwith which, of course, the author had no intention of dealing. Sir W. P.\nElderton propounded it as a reason for combining all sorts of experience,\nin that after the OM O[M] E M E[M] ONM etc. had been produced at great\ncost and with much labour the O[M] became standard for the calculation of\npremiums, and the O[M] for valuation purposes. But why was the O[M]\nused for the calculation of endowment assurance premiums ? Because,\nof course, if we had used the O[M] for whole life and the E[M] for endowment\nassurances, we would at the longer terms have been quoting less for an\nendowment assurance premium than for a whole life, and, of course,\nfurther, that the O[M] gave the larger premium. It was not, however,\nunusual for the non-profit whole life and endowment assurance premiums\nto be calculated on the O[NM] tables, and this was, I think, universally the\nbasis for temporary and contingent assurances and other financial risks.\nOne might hope that there may be in the near future a set of modern\nmonetary tables produced from the experience of the with-profit whole life\nmales exposed.\nI leave later speakers to discuss the method of graduation used and the\nother mathematical questions in the paper.\nMr. C. S. Penn.—The practical question which lies at the root of Mr.\nStoodley's investigation is certainly a very real one. I t comes down to\nthis : Is a table based on the combined mortality of whole life and endowment\nassurances suitable for the calculation of premium rates and valua-\ntion functions for both classes ? In so far as endowment assurance\npremiums are concerned, differences in mortality have comparatively\nlittle effect, and it is clear that even if the respective groups of statistics\nin the A1924-29 experience give a truly comparative measure of the respective\nmortality rates there will be no error of serious moment in using\nthe A1924-29 mortality for endowment assurance premiums, and what\nthere is will be on the safe side.\nWhen we consider whole life premiums the position is rather different.\nA variation in mortality which may be unimportant in the case of endowment\nassurances may have an appreciable effect on whole life rates. For\nexample, using the figures in Mr. Stoodley's Table F we find that P30 is\n1·395 by whole life data against 1·367 by A1924-29. P50 is 3·195 against\n3·126. These differences are not altogether insignificant.\nIn view of this it may be felt that an obvious alternative to using the\ndata of all classes combined would have been to discard the endowment\nassurance data and base the main published table on the whole life data\nalone. This would, of course, have meant ignoring the large proportion\nof the more recent part of the total experience which came from the\nendowment assurance section. I cannot myself see that this method would\nhave had any real advantage over that which was adopted. After all,\nthe experience of very few offices is going to coincide with the mortality\naccording to the general table, either the A1924-29 as published or one\nbased on the whole life data alone. Every office has to make its\nown adjustments for its different mortality. I could argue just as readily\nfor the elimination from the general table of (for instance) the data supplied\nby the great Industrial offices whose Ordinary business is of a rather\nspecial type and may be expected to be subject to mortality distinctly\ndifferent from that, for instance, of Mutual Life offices.\n", "Endowment Assurance Mortality 335\nI am afraid 1 have rather digressed from the subject of the paper. Mr.\nStoodley deserves praise for the ingenuity and perseverance he has displayed\nin his attempt to arrive at the truth of this question, but it may be\ndoubted whether any entirely hypothetical method, however elaborate in\ndetail, can be a convincing substitute for a direct investigation into the\ncomparative mortality in the different classes, year against year. The\nimpossibility of investigating this question directly, which has involved\nMr. Stoodley in a great deal of trouble, is one of the less happy consequences\nof the use of the census method in collecting the data. The census method\nhas distinct advantages in saving time, labour, and expense. The collection\nof material started in 1924, and I think it was probably and perhaps\nundoubtedly the method most suited to meet the special circumstances\nwhich existed at that time, a practical working table being wanted at the\nearliest possible moment. But the census method, as Mr. Stoodley has\nshown, has its definite limitations, and I feel it cannot be regarded as\nmore than a makeshift to be used until more scientific methods become\npracticable.\nI do not feel competent to criticise Mr. Stoodley's hypothetical method\nas I have not had time to follow out the various processes in detail. Like\nMr. Granger I must leave it to others to criticise these processes.\nOne point of especial interest to me is the attention Mr. Stoodley has\ndrawn to the difference between the mortality shown in the two sections\nof the select experience, which, of course, are comparable in time. There\nare, however, snags in the stream even here. The difference might have\nbeen accounted for if the larger proportion of the whole life data had been\nsupplied by the heavy-mortality offices and the larger proportion of the\nendowment assurance data by the light-mortality offices. However, I\nunderstand Mr. King, who is unfortunately laid up and unable to be with\nus to-night, has made some investigations from which he has formed the\nview that this is not so, and that the endowment assurance select mortality\nis actually lower than the whole life select, both in the heavy-mortality\noffices and the light-mortality offices, thus confirming Mr. Stoodley's\npaper on this point.\nReverting to the A1924-29 tables I am quite unrepentant on this subject.\nI think they are by no means perfect, and nobody but a lunatic could\npossibly claim that they were, but I do not think a table based on the\nwhole life experience alone would have been any more satisfactory. It\nwould still have been far from homogeneous.\nMr. Gwilt.—Mr. Granger I think expressed the view that Mr. Stoodley\nhas clearly proved that the temporary effect of selection lasts for considerably\nmore than 3 years, and he pointed to Table B to justify that\nsuggestion. It seems to me, however, that Table B does not prove anything\nabout selection after the first 5 years but merely shows Mr.\nStoodley's assumptions as to the variation of mortality by duration.\nI have not had an opportunity of examining in detail the methods by\nwhich Mr. Stoodley has arrived at his figures, but I gather that his interesting\nresults are based on arbitrary assumptions as to the variation of\nmortality by duration after the first 5 years and as to the distribution of\nthe exposed. to risk by duration, both in the whole life and endowment\nassurance classes.\nI greatly admire Mr. Stoodley's ingenuity in working out his results,\nbut I wish he had supplemented these results by giving us a rough indication\nof the kind of variation in mortality after the first 5 years and of\n", "336 Whole of Life and\ndistribution of exposed to risk which would reproduce the actual aggregate\nrates of mortality for durations 5 and over shown by the whole Me and\nendowment assurance classes respectively.\nI feel that when considering results which are necessarily based on wide\nassumptions—however reasonable—it is useful to know to what extent\nchanges in the assumptions would alter the conclusions. In this case one\nwould like to know whether the rates of mortality and the distribution of\nexposed to risk which would reproduce the observed results, assuming the\nmortality in both classes to be identical duration by duration, would or\nwould not be utterly ridiculous. However, the fact that we can only guess\nat the relative mortality of the two classes is, as Mr. Penn says, a serious\ncriticism of the census method. I find myself very much in agreement\nwith everything Mr. Penn has said, and I do not think it will be disputed\nthat in the circumstances of the time the census method was probably the\nonly practical one which could have been used for the collection of the\ninitial statistics for the assurance experience. But we have now had\n15 years' experience of the continuous investigation, and I think the time\nmust soon come to consider introducing other methods which will give\nmore information and will enable us to answer with some degree of accuracy\nimportant questions such as Mr. Stoodley has dealt with to-night.\nIn conclusion, may I say how much I have appreciated Mr. Stoodley's\npaper and how much I regret I have not been able to study it more closely.\nLetter from Sir William P. Elderton:—\nIn considering the relative mortality of whole of life and endowment\nassurances, Mr. Stoodley implies a criticism of the combination of endowment\nassurance and whole life policies to make one table, but it is worth\nbearing in mind as a further defence of this arrangement, that the number\nof deaths in the endowment assurance with profit experience up to age 40\nwas about ten times as great as that of the whole life, and that the endowment\nassurance experience is unimportant after 70 and may be somewhat\nunreliable round the popular maturity ages. Taking the endowment\nassurance experience, as published, there is no doubt that it shows a lighter\nmortality at any rate from 40 onwards than the life experience, but the\ntable based on the experience of individual offices given in the paper\nwritten by me with Messrs. Oakley and Smither indicates that this difference\nis accentuated owing to the relatively wide difference in certain large\noffices. Possibly, therefore, the choice of endowment assurance as against\nthe whole life policy has a greater influence on mortality in the less wealthy\nclasses of the community. Perhaps Mr. Stoodley will be thought by some\npeople to have given some evidence in support of what has been done by\nthe mortality committee in publishing one general table and also somewhat\nextreme tables of heavy and light mortality, for these three tables cover\na much wider range of mortality than the difference he discloses between\nwhole life and endowment assurances. An office might feel justified in\nusing the A1924-29 table for both its whole life and endowment assurances\nif its mortality approximates to the A1924-29 even although its endowment\nassurance showed a somewhat lighter mortality than its whole life, but it\nwould not be helped by a general endowment assurance table if, for\ninstance, its endowment assurance experience corresponded with that\nof the light and its whole life with that of the heavy table. My own feeling\nis that when it comes down to practice we must find a table which fits the\nexperience and is suitable for the purpose for which it is used.\nI have been much interested in Mr. Stoodley's Table B, but it would,\n", "Endowment Assurance Mortality 337\nI think, be helpful if he would give some explanation about it. Let us\nassume that that table really represents the facts of the offices as a whole.\nI t may be explained by a mortality depending on year of entry but,\nalternatively, by a selective withdrawal rate. Moreover I do not think\nthat Mr. Stoodley has made it clear exactly what he has done within the age\ngroup. Thus taking age group 50½-59½, the average age is 55 approximately\nat duration 5, but when we get to duration 44 we are dealing with\nsurvivors who entered between ages 6 and 15 and the average age of the\ngroup would be nearer 59½. Presumably Mr. Stoodley has made some\nallowance for this ; otherwise there is a gradual change of age all the way\ndown the column of his table giving a third possible explanation.\nI have been much interested in the ingenious way in which Mr. Stoodley\nhas dealt with the graduation of the experience, and bearing in mind the\nproblem he set himself, I do not think he could have done anything else\nthan he has done with regard to the errors to which he refers in his\nconcluding paragraph; nevertheless, these errors create an element of\nuncertainty.\nComing back again to the practical aspect of things, I cannot help\nwondering whether a division of a large experience according to class of\nbusiness will ever be adopted in practical work except that individual\noffices using a standard table which approximates to their own experience\nwill bear in mind the deviations in their own experience thrown up by\ndifferent classes, and in some cases offices will find that their endowment\nassurance mortality is heavier than their whole life mortality. There\nmay, of course, be special classes that have to be dealt with by using a\ndifferent mortality from the standard, but this is a separate problem from\nusing a different standard table for endowment assurance and whole life\nbusiness. The doubt whether we should in practice use different tables\ndoes not mean that an analysis such as Mr. Stoodley's is in any way wasted,\nfor it helps us to see one possible interpretation.\nMr. Stoodley will, I feel sure, appreciate that he could have made other\ndissections of the main table or by making other assumptions have reached\ndifferent results. Of course, anyone who feels that Mr. Stoodley's assumptions\ncan be improved on, can produce fresh tables, but I do not expect\nthat the monetary results would differ materially.\nThe Chairman (Mr. A. Graham Donald).—I suppose the elaboration of\nthe paper has made it somewhat difficult for most of us at this time to\ndevote for its consideration the time we should have liked, and possibly\nthat accounts for a smaller number than usual taking part in the discussion.\nI remember last century, if I may be allowed to go back so far, a famous\nhostess said that whenever conversation lagged she always invited Mr.\nGladstone to join them and then there was enough talk to keep things\ngoing, so in the same way I think in ordinary circumstances the 1924-29\nexperience has produced a good lot of discussion. Mr. Stoodley, however,\nhas given us methods which we cannot just talk about at a moment's\nnotice. We are very much indebted to him for his paper, which will be\nconsidered in quieter times, and which I hope will produce further discussion\nlater on. I therefore propose to him a hearty vote of thanks.\nMr. Stoodley, replying to the discussion, said:—I have to thank you\nfor the way in which you have received my paper, and also to thank those\nwho have contributed to the interesting discussion. I am afraid there\nhas been a good deal of digression from the main object of the paper,\nwhich I clearly stated was merely to establish that such a thing as class\n", '338 Whole of Life and\nselection did exist. I was not really concerned with the question of\nwhether it was desirable to have class tables as opposed to combined\ntables. In point of fact, however, I am in favour of the combined table,\nmainly for the practical reason given in (6). On the principal question of\nthe paper there have been three degrees of criticism. Mr. Granger is\nwholeheartedly with me, Mr. Penn expressed a degree of doubt and Mr.\nGwilt, I think, goes to the other extreme and states that the methods I\nhave adopted are entirely arbitrary. I do not agree with him. In arriving\nat the exposed to risk I have as far as possible used the available facts as\na basis and the assumptions I have been compelled to make are, I consider,\nreasonable. In the series of equations for the exposed to risk, u0 and u0\nare equated to observed facts ana the only assumption involved in\nequations (3) and (4) relates to the range over which the exposed to risk\nis distributed. But, here again, facts entered largely into the determination\nof this and the reasonableness of the assumption made is borne out by the\nresults of Table C. As regards the select rates of mortality, I was again\nworking largely with facts and from Table A I was perfectly justified in\nassuming as I did, that the ultimate rate would proceed by constant first\ndifferences. No other conclusion appeared to me feasible, although I\nmight agree up to a point with Sir William Elderton that the changing\ndistribution within each group might have a certain effect on the rates\nof mortality. In point of fact, however, any set of select rates would\nhave done for the purpose of establishing whether or not there was class\nselection, since I was concerned merely with degrees of difference between\nthe class ultimate rates and not with the absolute rates.\nI would here take the opportunitv of reiterating that the assumption\nof a progressive increase in the value of has, in view of the\ndistribution of the exposed to risk in the two classes, the effect 01 minimising\nrather than exaggerating any difference between the ultimate class\nrates of mortality due to factors other than temporary selection or year\nof entry influence.\nMr. Gwilt has put in a plea for reproducing the observed rates of\nmortality by assuming appropriate curves for the exposed to risk. On\nthe basis of the exposed to risk curves I have assumed, for the age group\n50½ to 59½ we get in the case of the whole life, a hypothetical rate of 1273\ncompared with an observed rate of 1387, and in the case of the endowment\nassurance a hypothetical rate of 1161 compared with an observed rate of\n1116.\nThese results are, I venture to suggest, precisely what one would expect\nfrom the adoption of common select rates of mortality lying between the\nrates for the two classes and confirm the assumptions regarding the\nexposed to risk.\nAlthough satisfied on this point, I did investigate the question further\non the basis of the " whole life " select rates of mortality obtained in the\nsame manner as the " combined " select rates of Table B. These select\nrates, weighted in relation to the exposed to risk, reproduce, of course, the\nultimate rate three years and over for the whole life class. By applying\nthem to the endowment assurance exposed to risk an endowment assurance\nultimate rate of 1248 is obtained compared with the observed rate of 1116.\nThis represents a disparity of 132 compared with 46 using the lighter\n" combined " select rates of mortality. In other words, the select rates\nwhich will reproduce the whole life ultimate rates, when applied to the\nendowment assurance experience produce an ultimate rate which is 11 per\ncent, in excess of the observed.\n', 'Endowment Assurance Mortality 339\nIt may be argued that a proportion of the difference given in column (7)\nof Table C and between the observed and hypothetical rates arises from\nthe range over which the endowment assurance exposed is distributed\nbeing too wide. On this point I may mention that to reproduce the\nendowment assurance observed rate, using the " combined " select rates\nof mortality, would demand an almost absurd distribution of the exposed\nto risk. For instance, taking z as 15, which results in a high-peaked\nfrequency curve running off at t = 18, we obtain an ultimate rate of 1108\ncompared with the observed rate of 1116. These results all confirm the\nconclusions arrived at in the paper, and will, I hope, satisfy Mr. Gwilt.\nI think I have dealt with all the main points raised in the discussion.\nAfter considering the discussion, Mr. Stoodley wrote in amplification of\nhis reply :—\nIn his contribution to the discussion, Mr. Granger infers that the rates\ngiven in Table B were arrived at by combining the rates of mortality and\nnot the experiences.\nThis is not the case, the rates having been obtained from the appropriate\nexposed and deaths.\nIn view of the general trend of the discussion I am tempted to enter\ninto the controversy on class tables as opposed to combined tables, but\nmy remarks in this connection will be limited to the counter argument\nmade by Mr. Perm as to the elimination of the data of the Industrial\noffices from the general body of data. In the valuation report of one of\nthe largest industrial offices it is stated that the mortality experience in\nthe endowment assurance branch corresponded with the A1924-29\naccording to age and duration and that the usual comparison of actual\nclaims with expected claims (irrespective of duration) showed that the\nactual claims amounted to only 78·3 per cent. of the expected. In the case\nof whole life assurances the actual claims were 116 per cent. of the expected\nallowing for an addition of one year to the age. Apart from their bearing\non Mr. Penn\'s argument, these results can leave no room for doubt as to\nthe conclusions of my paper.\nAs to Sir William Elderton\'s point regarding the effect of the changing\ndistribution within each group on the rates of mortality, it will be found\nthat the features of the group mortality rates disclosed in Table A are\npresent in the same general way in the rates for individual ages. It is also\nworthy of note that the highest value in each of the columns of Table B\nis lower than the corresponding group rate of mortality according to\nEnglish Life Table No. 10 (Males), and one may conclude from this that\nthe assumption of a progressive change is, at least, within reason. I fully\nappreciate Sir William Elderton\'s argument as to the changing distribution,\nwhile not admitting its material significance from the point of view of\nthe paper, and I would add that, in my first approach to the problem of\nascertaining the exposed to risk, I attempted to fit mathematical expressions\nto the horizontal and diagonal readings of the exposed to risk data\nover the first five years, the resulting curves to intersect at the appropriate\nVOL. XVI. 2 G\n', '340 Assurance Mortality\nquinquennial intervals. The break in the exposed to risk between durations\n3 and 4 to which attention is directed in the paper, however, made\nthe method impossible. I am somewhat surprised that the point was not\nraised as to the possible connection between the break in the select rates\nat duration 4 with the abnormal influx of business in the immediate postwar\nyears. This presents yet one more argument against the use of the\ncensus method.\n']</pre>
