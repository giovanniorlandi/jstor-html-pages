        <pre>['34\nIraq is not yet lost. The December parliamentary\nelections—with their extraordinary voter turnout\nand their promise of more inclusive Sunni\ninvolvement in government—marked a turning\npoint on the difficult path of stabilizing that tortured\ncountry. But Iraq is not yet won either, and it is\nimportant to understand why.\nWhatever happens in the months and years to\ncome, it is clear that in the two years following the\ntoppling of Saddam Hussein’s regime, the United\nStates squandered its extraordinary military victory\nthrough a series of gross strategic mistakes, acts of\nideological blindness, and a breathtaking failure to\nprepare militarily and politically for the postwar\nera. For the benefit of future policy making, it is\nvital that the United States learn the essential\nlessons for building democracy after conflicts that\nIraq has taught. \nWIN THE PEACE\nThe first lesson of America’s experience in Iraq \nis that the stabilization—not to mention the democratization—of\na state that has collapsed or been\ntoppled through violent conflict is an intrinsically\ndifficult and protracted process that requires a huge\ncommitment from both internal and international\nactors. To generate and sustain this commitment, any\neffort at administration and reconstruction of the\npostconflict state must mobilize legitimacy, both\ninternally in the postconflict country as well as internationally.\nIt is therefore ill-advised to go to war\nagainst a country for the specific purpose of democratizing\nit, or without compelling strategic reasons\nthat muster broad international support. \nIt was also a mistake to have gone to war largely\nalone. Washington can say that a coalition of some\n30 countries joined the effort, but no sustained\npublic opinion polling from any of these countries\nindicated that their publics supported what their\ngovernments were doing with the United States. In\nterms of international public opinion, the Iraq War\nwas largely an American effort. As we have seen in\nIraq, a war that lacks broad international sympathy\nand support depletes America’s stock of “soft\npower” (and even over time its hard military\npower), creates a host of special postwar problems,\nand tends to weaken the international consensus\nbehind democracy promotion as an endeavor.\nIt was unfortunate that the United States failed\nto correct its own international weakness and isolation\nin the postwar administration of Iraq. While\nit constructed a Coalition Provisional Authority\n(CPA) with the military and administrative participation\nof many countries (most prominently\nBritain), the occupation was in its design and structure\noverwhelmingly American. The Iraqis knew it.\nThe United Nations—which was ready to work in\nclose partnership with the United States as it had in\nAfghanistan but was largely spurned—knew it. And\nAmerica’s allies knew it. Clearly, the United States\nneeded to do much more than it did in Iraq to generate\nlegitimacy and trust.\nA second and related lesson underscores what\nWashington knew before it went in, and what the\nPentagon leadership ignored to the great misfortune\nof both Iraqis and the United States: that the United\nStates needs to prepare in advance for a major commitment\nand resource it adequately. As James Dob-\nbins and his colleagues noted in a 2003 RAND study,\nAmerica’s Role in Nation-Building: From Germany to\nIraq, the typical successful experience involves an\nLARRY DIAMOND, a Current History contributing editor, is a\nsenior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University\nand the author of Squandered Victory: The American Occupation\nand the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq\n(Times Books, 2005). In 2004 he served as a senior adviser to\nthe Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad.\n“The United States squandered its extraordinary military victory through a\nseries of gross strategic mistakes, acts of ideological blindness, and a breathtaking\nfailure to prepare militarily and politically for the postwar era.”\nIraq and Democracy: \nThe Lessons Learned\nLARRY DIAMOND\n', 'overwhelming commitment of force not so much\nfor winning the war—which the United States\ncould accomplish with the speed and maneuverability\nof Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld’s\nnew military—but for winning the peace and securing\nit in the immediate aftermath of the war. \nFrom the day that Baghdad fell on April 9, 2003,\nit was clear that the United States did not have\nenough troops on the ground. It never had enough\ntroops. Indeed, it never had enough of any kind of\nresource needed to secure the postwar era. Nor did\nit have the right mix of troops. It was missing, for\nexample, enough military police. What it needed—\nwhat the world needs—is a sort of muscular gendarmerie.\nThese would be well-armed and -trained\nmobile police that can be deployed in a situation like\nBaghdad and use nonlethal force to prevent the kind\nof massive looting of government institutions and\npublic infrastructure\nthat occurred in the\nwar’s aftermath. Even\nwithout this, senior\nArmy officers had\nsought several hundred\nthousand troops—\nat least twice or even\nthree times the number the United States had on the\nground—to invade and then stabilize Iraq after the\nwar. By a greater order of magnitude, the United\nStates needed more military police, more civil-affairs\nofficers, more armored vehicles, more helicopters,\nmore body armor—more of everything.\nNot only did the US leadership fail from the\nbeginning to deploy sufficient military resources to\nsecure the country, to deter and face down potential\nspoilers, and to seal the borders to prevent Al\nQaeda and other foreign jihadists from pouring in\nfrom Syria and Saudi Arabia—it also did not have\nin place enough resources for the civilian component\nof the postinvasion phase, including the capa-\nbility to move civilians about the country while\nadequately protecting them. These failures led to a\nsituation in which the United States could not effectively\nimplement either the economic reconstruc-\ntion plans or the political and civic reconstruction\nplans that it had for Iraq because it was so dangerous\nto move around. \nBesides the need for sufficient legitimacy and\nresources, the experience in Iraq yields more specific\nlessons about building electoral systems that could\naid Washington in the promotion of democracy in\nthe next few years in the Arab world. Of course, if\nthe United States were to become more active in this\nregard, as President Bush has committed it to doing,\nit will not confront the circumstances of a shattered\nstate and a post-totalitarian landscape in the way it\nhas in Iraq. Still, the American experiment in Iraq\noffers hands-on experience in several areas. \nBUY TIME FOR POLITICS\nBuilding a level and pluralistic playing field is\nextremely important. The United States encountered\nin Iraq the “flattened landscape” that was\nfound in the Soviet Union, Romania, and some of\nthe other postcommunist countries after their ruling\nregimes fell. These nations had essentially no\ncivil society or pluralistic array of political parties.\nIn the shadows of severe authoritarianism in the\nMuslim Middle East, the one type of political group\nthat can mobilize outside the state’s gaze and \nbuild support tends to involve some degree of radical\nIslamist ideology. If\na country moves from\na political vacuum very\nrapidly to elections, it\nwill not have a level\nplaying field because \nof the overwhelming\nadvantage of recently\nsurfaced Islamist movements and parties, whose\ndemocratic credentials or commitments are at best\nambiguous and at worst entirely absent. Moreover,\nin the absence of established political parties and civil\nsociety, the Islamist or authoritarian tendency will\nhave a tremendous head start.\nThis creates concern about how to buy time and\nmobilize resources to try to level the political playing\nfield. It is one of the issues that concerned the\nCoalition Provisional Authority, and it is one of the\nreasons why the CPA wanted to delay elections in\nIraq. Unless there is time for different types of political\nparties, social movements, and civic organiza-\ntions to develop—including groups that can project\na more moderate, democratic, secular, or, at least,\ndemocratic Islamist orientation onto the political\nand electoral landscape—then the electoral arena\nwill be dominated by a force that is not democratic.\nOr it may become polarized, as it did in Iraq,\nalong ethnic and identity lines. The January 2005\nelection, for all of its deeply moving character and\nsuccessful elements, was largely an identity referendum.\nNinety percent of the Kurds voted for the\nKurdish list, more than 70 percent of the Shiites\nvoted for the United Iraqi Alliance (a coalition of\nShiite religious parties), and about 70 percent of the\nSunnis did not vote. \nIraq and Democracy: The Lessons Learned • 35\nAfter nearly three years and a bitter cost in lives \nand treasure, the United States now has a real\nchance to help Iraq move toward stabilization.\n', 'Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most powerful\nShiite leader, had demanded early direct elections\nfor both a constituent assembly and a transitional\nparliament. Although the reasons why the United\nStates resisted this were understandable, they were\nnot based solely on the need for time to develop the\nadministrative agenda and electoral framework.\nWashington was worried, frankly, that people who\nmight not be committed to democracy and a liberal\nagenda would win—and win overwhelmingly. Yet\nbecause the American occupation was so badly lacking\nin legitimacy within Iraq (and internationally),\nauthorities did not have the standing and trust that\nwould have been required to delay elections very\nlong without the Shiite south violently resisting.\nAs a result of the skillful mediation of the United\nNations and its special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, a\ncompromise was reached in February 2004 that\ndelayed elections for a\ntransitional national\nassembly until January\n2005. This was about\neight months longer\nthan Sistani and the\nShiite religious parties\nwanted to wait, but it\nwas about two years\nearlier than might have been desirable and achievable\nif there had been from early in the postwar\nperiod a more broad-based, legitimate interim\nadministration, of Iraqis, chosen by Iraqis. \nThere needs to be a strategy for democratization\nin the Arab world, and it needs to be serious in\nterms of having true democratization as the goal. It\nis not enough to engage in what Georgetown University’s\nDaniel Brumberg and other specialists have\ncalled “tactical liberalization”—a game of hide-andseek,\nback-and-forth, but never real, sustained\nmovement toward democracy. At the same time,\nchange should be gradual enough to give time for\npolitical parties to build their organizations, craft\nprograms, and mobilize political support—points\nalso made by a 2005 Council on Foreign Relations\ntask force report on political change in the Arab\nworld and the US role, In Support of Arab Democracy.\nGO LOCAL FIRST\nIn addition to how soon elections are held, it\nalso matters where and in what order they are held.\nThis is another lesson that the Iraqi postwar experience\nreinforces and sustains. It helps to have local\nelections first. The CPA was mistaken not to have\ngone ahead with local elections in many communities—local\nelections that different Iraqi commu-\nnities were asking for, that many civilian and military\nCPA officials wanted to hold, and that\nAmbassador Paul Bremer and other officials in the\nCPA headquarters in Baghdad vetoed and prevented\nfrom happening. \nOf course, critics argued that there was no electoral\nregister, no voting infrastructure, no parties,\nno electoral law. These were serious obstacles. Yet\nthe United States could have used—and in a few\ncases local officials did in fact use—the records of\nhousehold registration for Iraq’s food-ration system\nand other practical means in order to register voters\nand allow them to cast ballots to choose local\nleaders. When local elections occur early, new\nactors emerge who have credibility and legitimacy,\nand who have roots in their community. This process\nof pushing forward local leaders, and encour-\naging them to garner\nsupport from within\ntheir own communities,\ntends to soften\nor deemphasize the\nmajor identity cleavages\nin a country. It\ncould have exercised\nsome brake on the\npolitical tendency of elections in a postconflict situation\nto become an identity referendum or a\ndeeply ideological and symbolic process. \nThe United States and its allies should not, of\ncourse, apply what has been learned inflexibly and\nwithout reflecting on the local situation of a country\nthat is emerging out of conflict or moving,\nhopefully, into democracy. But the lesson of Iraq\nregarding early local elections could also apply to\na number of Arab nations where political openings\nare occurring, or where the people are at least\nappealing for them. Democratization in these\ncountries might be more viable and sustainable if\nit proceeded with early emphasis on truly democratic\nand open local-level elections, where less is\nat stake.\nPower can thus be dispersed and a more pluralistic\nlandscape can emerge without people feeling that\ntheir vital interests might be threatened. The practice\nof local political competition, and the need for victorious\npoliticians and parties to deal with practical\nissues of local and municipal governance, might then\ngenerate the pragmatism in governance and the construction\nof mutual political trust and tolerance that\ncould enable democratization to proceed more fully\nto higher levels of authority. \n36 • CURRENT HISTORY • January 2006\nIt is ill-advised to go to war against a country\nfor the specific purpose of democratizing it,\nor without compelling strategic reasons \nthat muster broad international support.\n', 'This points to yet another lesson of the Iraq\nexperience: the importance of decentralized\nauthority. If local and even mid-level provincial\nelections are going to be meaningful, power has to\nbe devolved and resources provided to lower levels\nof government. Arab states historically have\nbeen extremely centralized. This was one of the\nproblems of Iraq; it is one of the problems characteristic\nof virtually all of the world’s petro-states.\nWhen people conduct politics only in a central\npolitical arena, this becomes conducive to the\npolarization of politics around larger identities. It\nis not conducive to a just distribution of resources\nor to a democratic approach to politics. If there is\nonly one political arena at the central national\nlevel—and everything is at stake in that arena—\nthen no one can afford to lose.\nIf, on the other hand, a large number of local\nelections take place, then Sunnis in Anbar\nProvince and Kurds in Kurdistan and Shiites in the\ncity of Basra know that whatever happens in the\ncenter, they are going to be able to exercise some\npolitical power in their province. And if they\nreceive some guaranteed share of the oil wealth to\nspend in their provinces and their communities,\nthis takes some pressure off national-level politics.\n(We perhaps are beginning to see that the Sunnis,\nwho have historically been the strongest advocates\nfor a highly centralized fiscal and political system—since\nthey controlled it—are waking up to\nthe fact that decentralization can be useful to\nthem. If the negotiations this summer for a new\nconstitution had not been so rushed, and if they\nhad not adopted such a radical formula for\nregional power, which could potentially eviscerate\nthe central government, the Sunnis might have\ngravitated more clearly to this understanding.) \nPICK THE RIGHT SYSTEM\nThe electoral system matters. Yet, partly because\nit seemed administratively easier to manage in the\ndifficult circumstances of Iraq in late 2004 and January\nof 2005, the electoral system selected by a\nUnited Nations team was inappropriate for Iraq.\nThe Iraqi interim government and the United States\nhad invited in UN officials to help choose, train, and\nadvise a new Iraqi electoral commission. Bremer\nand the CPA had insisted on having an independent\nelectoral commission, even when many Iraqi political\nparties involved in the governing council\nwanted to relentlessly politicize and split up control\nof this body. This, too, is a lesson from Iraq. The\nelectoral process requires popular confidence, and\nthat comes from a neutral, professional electoral\nadministration that is totally insulated from partisan\npolitics. \nBut the system chosen for the January elections\nwas proportional representation in a single nationwide\ndistrict, one that only a few other relatively\nsmall countries use (such as the Netherlands and,\nironically, Israel). While proportional representation\nmade sense for Iraq, the absence of any district\nbasis for the system did not. No area of the country\nhad any indication of what kind of minimum representation\nit would have in parliament. Since the\nSunni areas had been the site of far greater violence\nand disruption, Sunnis feared that they would wind\nup being severely underrepresented in such a system,\nwhich accords seats to parties purely on the\nbasis of national vote totals. This was one of the\nmajor reasons the Sunni Arab parties boycotted the\nJanuary 30 elections—a disastrous move for them,\nand for the country, since it intensified the polarization\nand violence.\nGenerally, proportional representation is useful\nin managing ethnic conflict and ensuring a just,\ninclusive result. But using only a single nationwide\ndistrict leaves no possibility for local candidates,\nlocal identities, and local initiatives to emerge. And\nthere is nothing that is more conducive to an election’s\nbecoming an identity referendum than a sin-\ngle national-list system in which voters hardly even\nknow who the candidates are. They are literally just\nvoting for a party and a symbol. In the case of Iraq,\nthat meant most Shiites were simply voting for Sistani’s\npicture on a poster.\nIf Iraq had adopted a system of smaller-scale multimember\ndistricts based, for example, on the bound-\naries of the 18 provinces—something many of us\nwho were within the CPA recommended for the first\nnational elections—or even open-list systems under\nwhich people could look at the candidates and vote\nfor individual candidates and rank them, that might\nhave allowed local leaders to emerge and develop\nsome constituencies. It could also have required\nelected officials to be responsible and accountable to\nlocal-level constituencies.\nFortunately, the provincial-list proportional representation\nsystem is precisely what Iraq adopted\nfor the December 15 elections. This decision,\nwhich then assured a minimum number of seats\nfor each province in the new parliament, played a\nmajor role in giving Sunni Arab parties confidence\nto participate vigorously in the elections. Although\nsome Sunnis complained about the allocation of\nseats to their provinces (based on voter registration\nIraq and Democracy: The Lessons Learned • 37\n', 'figures), their political and religious leaders urged\nfull participation in the election, and even the\ndiehard Saddamist and Al Qaeda terrorists largely\nrefrained from the kind of violence and intimidation\nthat suppressed the Sunni vote in January. As a\nresult, Sunni voter participation soared on December\n15, with ordinary Sunni voters now feeling the\nsame pride and resolve in participating that other\nIraqi communities had in January. The election\nitself was an unprecedented logistical and political\nsuccess, with some 11 million Iraqis (over twothirds\nof those registered) voting at more than\n6,000 polling stations, and with only 18 reported\nattacks against polling sites (compared to about\nfive times that in January). Even in the immediate\naftermath of the balloting (as this magazine went\nto press), it was clear that the widespread and\nenthusiastic participation would ensure a much\nmore representative parliament, and so at least the\npossibility of a more inclusive government. In the\ncoming months, however, the stabilization of Iraq\nwill depend to a great extent on whether the different\npolitical and sectarian groups are able to\nshare power and fashion a more broadly acceptable\nconstitutional bargain, particularly on federalism\nand the control of oil and gas resources.\nDISARM THE MILITIAS\nAnother lesson made obvious in Iraq is that any\neffort at postconflict reconstruction must confront\nthe problem of order. A country cannot build a\ndemocratic state unless it first has a state—a set of\ninstitutions of political authority that exercise a\nmonopoly over the means of violence in a territory.\nIf a democratic electoral process is to be successful\nand sustained to allow the emergence of a truly\ndemocratic system, attention must therefore be paid\nto the problem of armed force outside the control of\nthe state. Armed groups controlled by political parties\nand political movements can use this private\nforce to aggrandize their power, intimidate voters,\nand create an undemocratic playing field.\nThe CPA tried over many months to implement in\nessence a “DDR” plan—disarmament, demobilization,\nand reintegration of militias into the Iraqi economy\nand society. But the effort began too late. It lacked the\nforce and legitimacy to be implemented effectively.\nAnd it was ultimately derailed by the twin insurgencies\nof the Falluja-based Sunni resistance and the Shi-\nite fighters under Muqtada al-Sadr that erupted in\nApril 2004, and then by the lack of enthusiasm for\nthe disarmament effort on the part of the Iraqi\ninterim government that took power on June 28.\nIraq thus went into elections in January 2005 facing\nnot only a virulent Sunni-based insurgency, but\nalso increasingly muscular and ambitious Shiite\nmilitias on the streets as well. In the north was the\ncountry’s most powerful Iraqi armed force, the Kurdish\npeshmerga, which had been extending the\npower and de facto borders of Kurdistan through\nforce, even as it brought a degree of stability to the\nfar north unknown in the rest of Iraq. The existence\nof these powerful, non-state militias could not help\nbut affect the electoral environment.\nTo a degree that will take some time to fully\nassess, the mobilization of the militias did diminish\nthe freedom and fairness of the December 15 elections.\nThis was particularly so in the southern\nprovinces, where militias associated with the Shiite\nreligious parties of the United Iraqi Alliance intimidated\nand obstructed opposing political forces,\nattacked their headquarters, ripped down their\ncampaign banners, and terrorized, assaulted, and\nassassinated a number of their candidates and campaign\nworkers. The electoral misconduct was par-\nticularly brazen in Basra, where many police cars\nand government buildings displayed the electoral\nsymbol of the Alliance, or the ballot number of its\nelectoral list, 555, and where Iraqi police officers\nurged people to vote for the 555 list on election day\n(in open defiance of the electoral rules).\nThe militia problem is going to get considerably\nworse in future elections. Moreover, it is not just\nvoting we must worry about. During the past year\nin particular, the militias of the Shiite Islamist parties\nand movements have used their high degree of\norganization and their coercive power to penetrate\nthe police and the military. In the context of the\nprovincial electoral victories that their parties and\nmovements won in January 2005, they also have\ntaken control of local governments and imposed\nharsh interpretations of sharia, or Islamic law. At\nthe same time they have exacted vigilante\nvengeance against Sunnis believed involved with\nthe insurgency or Hussein’s regime.\nA kind of Islamic state is emerging in the Shiite\nsouth. Although the Islamist parties—gathered\ntogether in the United Iraqi Alliance (still with the\nimplicit blessing of Ayatollah Sistani)—did not do\nquite as well nationally in the December elections as\nthey had in January, within the southern provinces\nthey remain determined to consolidate their hold on\npower. For some time to come, there may be little\nthat the United States can do to prevent the drift \nto Islamic rule in the southern provinces, except try\nto strengthen moderate and secular groups through38\n• CURRENT HISTORY • January 2006\n', 'out Iraq, while standing up vigorously for basic principles\nof human rights and constitutionalism.\nMeanwhile, the international community, the\nUnited States, the United Nations, the Europeans—\neveryone with a stake in a peaceful, stable Iraq,\nincluding, obviously, the Iraqi state itself—will need\nto confront the problem of very substantial armed\nforce in the hands of private actors, political parties,\nand religious and social movements. These groups\nare bound to use that force in ways that will undermine\ndemocratic principles and processes if they\nare not demobilized.\nUnfortunately, demobilizing them has never\nbeen more difficult, not only because many of their\nparties have won political power and legitimacy,\nbut also because they have increasingly merged\nwith the Iraqi state. A major test of Iraq’s stability\nand viability in the coming months will be\nwhether the units of the new Iraqi army and police\nare loyal to the state as a whole, or to the parties\nand movements from which they were recruited as\nmilitia fighters. \nDEAL WITH THE INSURGENTS\nEven with the success of the December 15 elections,\nIraq will not become a full democracy any\ntime soon. There are simply too many groups on\nthe ground, too powerful and too violent, that do\nnot value or want a truly democratic order. Yet, with\nthe prospect of a more legitimate and inclusive parliament\nand government, there is a chance for Iraq\nto turn away from the incremental descent into civil\nwar and toward stabilization—if the insurgency can\nbe significantly diminished.\nAlthough the Iraqi armed forces are considerably\nlarger, and more capable and spirited, than they\nwere a year ago, there is still no prospect of defeating\nthe insurgency through military means alone.\nRather, turning the corner on the insurgency\nrequires a political process that divides the more\ntactical elements of the insurgency—the Sunni\ntribal, political, and religious forces that have been\nseeking at least some share of power in the new\norder, and an end to the American occupation—\nfrom the diehard Al Qaeda and Saddamist elements. \nIn this respect, it is possible to see hopeful signs\non the horizon. Despite their concerns and anxieties\nover the rise of targeted violence and assassinations\nagainst Sunnis, the Sunni parties and movements\nparticipated massively in the December elections and\nappear to have won a share of seats in much closer\nproportion to their share of the population than they\ndid in January, when they boycotted the vote.\nIn November 2005, the Arab League gathered in\nCairo to hold the broadest meeting yet of Iraqi\npolitical forces, including members of the transitional\ngovernment and elements associated with the\nSunni-based insurgency. They agreed on the principles\nof power-sharing and on the need to establish a\ntimetable for American withdrawal. At the same\ntime, the US ambassador in Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad,\nhas shown a flexibility, deftness, and interest in\nnegotiation with insurgent elements that his predecessors\nlacked. \nThere are now three imperatives. First, power-sharing\nmust be made to work so that all groups see that\nthey can better secure their interests through peaceful\nparticipation in politics and government than\nthrough violence. Second, compromise must be\nachieved in the forthcoming process to review and\namend the constitution adopted in October (over the\nbitter objections of the Sunni Arab communities,\nwhich voted overwhelmingly against it). In particular,\nthe federal system must be revised to clearly estab-\nlish central government control over future (as well\nas current) oil and gas production, and to rule out the\ncreation of new governing regions, or at least to limit\nthe number of provinces that can come together into\na single region. This would remove one of the most\nalarming Sunni concerns, a Shiite super-region with\ncontrol over most of the country’s oil resources. And\nthird, comprehensive negotiations are needed\nbetween the United States and the insurgents, involving\nas well the new Iraqi government and the media-\ntion of the United Nations and the Arab League.\nThrough such negotiations, it may be possible to\nentrench power-sharing provisions and develop a\nmutually acceptable plan for American military\nwithdrawal. This would lead many of the Sunni\ninsurgent groups to suspend the violent struggle\nand to take visible public steps to discourage and\ndelegitimate the continuation of the insurgency.\nWith greater Sunni cooperation, it may also become\npossible to isolate, capture, kill, or expel the Al\nQaeda fighters who have been responsible for the\nmost destructive and destabilizing violence. \nAfter nearly three years and a bitter cost in lives\nand treasure, the United States now has a real\nchance to help Iraq move toward stabilization. It\nwill not be quick or easy, and real democracy may\nbe years away. But compared with the tyranny of\nHussein or the chaos since the invasion, stabilization\nwould count as considerable progress. It would\nalso improve long-term prospects for democratization\nefforts elsewhere in the region, if the bitter\nlessons learned in Iraq are heeded. ■\nIraq and Democracy: The Lessons Learned • 39\n']</pre>
