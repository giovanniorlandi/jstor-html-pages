The men were\ntaken to Columbia today for a hearing\nbefore R. Revcrley Sloan, United\nStates commissioner, and released on\nbond of $100 each.

C., died at a local hotel\nhere yesterday and this morning the\nundertaker in charge of his body announced\nthe death of John Wanatnaker,\nthe merchant and former\npostmaster general.\nThe mistake in identification was\nfurthered by an announcement at the\nBiscayne Yacht club that John Wanamaker\nwas in Florida waters on his\nprivate yacht. The false report\nspread all over the South and got as\nfar as Philadelphia before it was\novertaken when it was announced\nthere that John Wanamaker was alive\nand well in his office there.\nRailroad officials here, believing\nthe dead man to be John Wanamaker,\ngave instruction to prepare for taking\nthe body of to Philapelhia tonight\nand gave orders for every attention in\nin a little less than an hour, but not\nbefore it had been reported generally\nthroughout the country that the great\nPhiladelphia merchant had passed\naway.\nPhiladelphia, Jan. 6.?John Wanamaker\ntoday laughed away a report\nfrom the South that he was dead. Sitting\nin his office on the seventh floor\nof his store building engaged in a\nconference when he was apprised of\nthe report, the former postmaster\ngeneral said: "I am as well as you\nare. There is nothing wrong with\nme, hut a slight cold. I received a\nletter today making an engagement\nfor 926."\nMr. Wanamaker, who is in his 84th\nyear, was curious to know where the\nreport came from. "If the report of\nmy death is to be sent from Florida\n1 will stay away from there," he said.\nHounds For Hunting\nDeer and Boar\nCoblenz, Jan.

Some time during the first two\nweeks in March has been set for the\nmomentous gathering, and Genoa has\nbeen designated as the place where it\nshall be held.\nAn invitation to the United States\nto participate has been extended\nthrough the American ambassador to\nGreat Britain, George JIarvey, who is\nhere as official observer for his\ngovernment.\nRussia\'s participation in the Genoa\nconference is conditional upon acceptance\nof a number of conditions,\nnamely, that she cease Bolshevik\npropaganda abroad, that she undertake\nnot to attack her neighbors and\nthat she recognize all the honorable\nobligations entered into by preceding\nRussian governments.\nPremier Lloyd George of Great\nBritain took the most prominent part\nin the deliberations, speaking for an\nhour. In his opinion a place for decisive\naction had been reached if the\neconomic structure of Europe was\nbe saved. Describing the present\nmeeting of the supreme council as\nthe most important since the armistice,\nhe declared that the public\nopinion of the world demanded that\nthe allies take wider responsibilities\nto revive Europe.\nEngineer Fant In Columbia\nEngineer D.

Jerusalem, Jan. 6.?Great interest\nhas been aroused here by a semi-official\nannouncement that an agreement\nhas been reached between the\n. British government and a group of\nmen representing the Zionist organization\nfor the exploitation of lands\n, i lying beyond the River Jordan and\n\' the Dead Sea. It has always been\n| known that proper development would\nreveal the presence of oils and other\ni minerals in great quantity in that\n, | section of the country.\n, From reliable sources, it is understood\nthat the agreement involves a\npj tract of land extending from the Syrian\ncoast on the North to the valley\n; of Mojeb on the South and from the\n: town of Eltuba on the East to the |\n| River Jordan and the Dead Sea on\n"J the West.\nCelebrating Fourth\nAnniversary of Revolution\nRiga, Latvia, Jan. 3.?Karl Radek,\nthe Bolshevik writer and propagandist,\nhas published an article in the\nMoscow Pravada\'s edition celebrating\nthe fourth anniversary of the Lenine\nrevolution in which Radek denies the\nwidely-circulated story that the Bolshevik\nrevolution in Kus-ia was\nfinanced by German gold.\nRadek\'s article is devoted to a description\nof the historic icturn of Nikolai\nLenine from Switzerland\n.hrough Germany to Russia in tht\nspring of 1U17, with the permissiot:\nof the German government. This was\nthe beginning of the revolution and oi\nRussia\'s withdrawal from the war.\nRadek asserts that Lenine and his\nparty of 40 sent an emissary to tin\nGerman minister in Switzerland ask\ning free passage for all emigrant:\nwho wanted to return to Rus. ia an*\ninsisting that during tl eir p ts age\nthe German government should no\natenipt to enter into commit"icatioi\nwith them.\n"On our side," Radek asserted. "\\v\npromised to do everything for light\nening the position of German prison\ners of war in Russia and also to ex\npedite the return of German . ten lid\nfront Russia to Germany.\n"After a little time, the Genua\ngovernment agreed to our condition\nOf course, it was quite clear to u\nthat the German government intends\nto speculate on this episode, reckon\ning that after our arrival in Russi;\nwe would work for peace. But thi\nconjecture interested us very little fo\nwe knew that if, in Russia, the revo\nlution took a proletarian turn the\nits influence would tell far boynn\nthe confines of Russia."\nThe party, says Radek, had an escort\nof German officers and, when i\nhalted at railway stations, seen\nagents surrounded it to keep the Ger\nman soldiers and other persons awn\nfrom it dangerous Bolsheviki.\nThe ! ?\'urning emigrants v ere s\nhilarious that Lenine had to take ove\nnviiPiiUvn niifVu.ritv nnil :i1im\nsome ovJer.\nOne attempt was made while th\ntruin was passing through German;\nsays Radel:. to .sound out the party o\nthe questi* .1 of working for peat\nwith Germany.

The Bolshevik\nRadek says, refused to deal with bin\nThe Russian party then went t\nStockholm, where, says Radek, "\\V\nreceived 1500 Swedish kroner whic\napparently was that vast sum whic\nwas figuring in all tales of French p?\nriots as Germoti gold funds supplif\nI for the Russian revolution."\nIncome Tax Law\nHas Two Chinge\nThe revenue act <?f 1921 eontair\ntwo new and important provision\nwhich are the subject of frequent ii\nquiry. The first relates to the pe\nsona] exemption allowed married pe\n<ons, and the second to the provisic\nrequiring that a return be made <\ngross income of $5,000 or more.\nThe act provides that a marrit\nperson, living with husband or wif\nwhose net income for 1921 wa. $5 Of\nor less shall he allowed a personal e>\nemption of $2,500. If the net incom\nof such person was over $5,000 tli\nextension is $2,000. Under the rex\nenue act of 191$ the personal exemr\ntion allowed a married person w?\n$2,000. regardless of the amount <\nnet income. The normal tax rate r<\n.mains unchanged, 4 per cent on tli\nrst $1,000 of net income above th\nexemptions and 8 per cent on the r?\nmaining net income.\nIn order that an income slightly i\nexcess <;f $5,000 shall not he suhjoct\n\'>d to an inordinately disproportionat\ntax because of the reduction of th\nexemption to $2,000 thereon, the la\nprovides that such reduction sh;?l 1 no\noperate to increase the tax. whir\nwould he payable if the exempt in\nwere $2,500. by more than the am u,\nof the net income in excess of $~,ont\nFor example, on a net income o\n$5,010, the tax without this savin,\nclause would be $120.40, whi.-h iper\ncent on $5,010, the amount of no\nincome less an exemption of $2,000\nThe actual tax is $110.10, minutci\nas follows: From the not income o\n$5,010 is deducted $2,500. . avinjr *2,\n510, the 4 pet* cent, tax "? whicl\namounts to $100.40. T<> ih . i adder\n$10, "the amount of net ir .\\-m?- in ex\ncess of $5,000."\nThe personal exempt ions nllowet\nmarried persons apply a!-to to th<\nhead of a family, a person who sup\nports in one household one or mor<\nrelatives by blood, nnrriaee <?r adoption.\nHeretofore, a person wi oc net income\nwas less than his exemptior\nt-ti.uuu ii isIiiiiit. or 11 married i\nwas not required to file :i return. Under\nthe revenue act of l?r>i, if th(\ngross income of an inrli. i<l i,-i! equalled\nor exceeded $5,000, or if the combined\ngross income of a married ,-ouple and\nthat of dependent minor children\nequalled or exceeded $5,000, a return\nmust be filed, regardless of the\npmount of net income.\n"Net income" is gro-s income, less\ncertain deductions. Tin- fact that allowable\ndeductions from gross income,\nfor business exnenses, losses\nbad debts, etc., may reduce the net\nincome to an amount be\' .w the \'pprsonal\nexemptions of $1 000 or $\'2,000,\ndoes ont alter the requirement to file\na return of gross income, if such gross\nIncome equalled or exceeded $5,000.?\nThe State.\n| i i hit WMiipaiijr 10 ^itvii ? p^nuu v*. i\nlive years in which to carry on the!\n\' preliminary work. Should oil or any\nlj other minerals be fount!, an extension\nll I\nj of time would be Riven provided the\ni company pays to the British govern-1\nL": ment f 1,000 as a royalty fee. Besides\n*: a straight tax of one shilling is dei\nmanded on each and every ton of oil\nor other minerals taken from the\n: j ground.\nWhat such a venture will mean to\na the life of Palestine is not hard to\ni. guess. Closely connected with the\ns search for oil would be the need for\n\'li generating electricity fr >m the waters\n- of the River Jordan with which to\na | carry on the work. Railroad lines\n- \'J would also have to be constructed in\ni all directions, in order to facilitate\n- transportation of the mineral products\n:i found. With oil, electricity and raild\nroads, Palestine would bo bound to re!\nceive a great impetus toward indus;.j\ntrial progress.\nt The striking feature of the whole\ntj atfair, is that it points io a departure\n_ on the part of the government from\nv its waiting policy as regards new cn:\nterprises. The government of Pales0\n1 tine is poor and lacks funds with\nwhich to develop the hidden resources\n( of the land. Only by private initiative\nand private capital could the country\nbo built up. It is asserted here that\nv thus far the government which takes\n\' its orders from London, has not only\nfailed to lend moral support, but has\n/ gone so far as to discourage and C" en\n\'J stop new ventures.\n\' ! Moscow Facing Long\nPeriod of Misery\n1 Moscow, Jan. ft.?Signs grow as\nij the winter deepens that even Mosc >w\no faces a long period of misery, noto\'\nwithstanding the conditions here arc\nt? far better than anv where else in\nb! Central Russia.\ni- The struggle for food anil clothing\nis is all absorbing. They are the only\nthings that cunt. Home, family t\'es\nand obligations, friendship, art, politics,\npublic and private ambitions?\n,3 all re subjugated to these two elemental\nneeds.\n,s Most Russians are convinced that\ns the mere return to free trade and\ncapitalism will not right the wrong.\nr_ the country has suffered, nro the\nsigning of new orders bring back the\n>n old life of the peasant, the bout\n,f! geois and the noble, nor make Rus\n! sians again a wealthy people\nThe struggle for existence is so\n(1 j hitter that few have time to give\nIP much though to the future,. Th"?\n. i needs of today are too pressing in\n, I oe h eases, for example, as the fr|(\nmer wealthy noble and his wife from\n. Smolensk, who now live without fire\n, | or food in a Moscow garret which the\nhusband cannot leave because he has\n,1*1 no -.hoes. His wife speaks half a\n,.j dozen languages yet she can find no\nl(, employment.\nlf. In the same condition is a woman\nwho once owned 200 mites of land\nfronting on the Caspian Sea. Arrest\n? ed as a spy, separated from her husband\nand children and shipped north\nto die, she is now eking out an extem-e\nby peddling eggs and vege\'\n-Me:; in Moscow.\n,t Speculation and robbery are the\n(wo favorite ways of obtaining the\ntl necessities of life.\n, New Invention To\nf Fuel Airplanes\nI Paris, Jan. 5.?An invention recent(\nly perfected by Godfrey Cabot, of\nl Cambridge, Mass., the American del1\negate. It is designed to make possif\nble the taking up of fuel by an air\nplane in motion, aroused great in1\ntcrest at the first congress on Aerial\n1 Navigation held here. Trans-atlantic\n- air travel would be greatly facilitated\nby this method as stops at "airmen\'s\nli islands" would not be necessary at in2\ntervals in the Atlantic ocean and air-j\nplanes would have much additional\n> space available for passengers and\n- mnil which otherwise would be taken\nup by fuel sufficient for one crossing.\nMr. Cabot thinks that transatlantic\ni air navigation will be a paying proposition\nwithin 15 years provided airplanes\ndo not carry fuel enough for an\nentire trip. With a minimum of fuel\nI nnd a maximum of <tr>nno tar mail and\nI passengers it could be made a sucI\ncessful enterprise, Mr. Cabot said. He\ni1 assumed that ocean crossings would\nhe quite ordinary occurrences withirt\na few years.\nI m i!\nAmerican Club\nOrganized In Riga\nRiga, Jan. 6.?An American Luncheon\nclub has been organized in Rigatj\nwith a chatrer membership of 30.\'\nmost of whom are here on govrenment,\nAmerican Relief Administration\nor American Red Cross business.\nFT.

Lra\nMove to Wipe\nOut Speculation 0f\ntht\nBerlin, Jan. 5.-?A united move by for\nfederal and state governments to im\nwipe out speculation in necessities for\nof life has begun. Police and govern- me\nment secret agents have gone into bul\nevery city, town, village and virtual- fai\n!y every farm house in a search for\nevidence against usurers. Ch\nStringent measures have been\nadopted against a continuance of\nplundering and rioting, which, it has I\nbeen ascertained, was instigated in An\nsome cases by "red" agitators for Spi\npolitical purposes. Numerous ar- ed\nrests have been made, both of profi- be!\nteers and looters. Spi\nAn effort to induce workmen to\nstrike and join in a crusade against fha\n"capitalism" promptly failed, even\nradical newspapers adn labor leaders Prs\ntaking the position thtat "Germany the\nwould not tolerate introduction of tha\nBolshevist methods at this time." *\nRecent investigations have disclos- *5e.\ned that the boosting of prices and ^\nthe great "selling out" campaign eg\nwhich came on the heels of the da- we\npreciation of the mark early in the ?.xj\nwinter was not entirely due to the 18.\nhordes of foreigners who invaded the ^ai\ncountry to make extensive purchases.\nThe German profiteers bought out r\nwhole stores and removed the mer- 101\nchandise from the market, to await ma\nthe increase in prices which was cer- a\nlain to follow. Some merchants hung e\nout the ?ign "sold out," closed their\nstroes and also waited. . _ .\nWorkmen, unemployed, and the ,ri\npoorer people were so angered by ^\nthese methods that sporadic outbreaks\noccurred in many parts of\nGermany, shops were broken into and\nplundered, and a few proprietors\nwere beaten or whipped.\nnu _ i_ i _ cl!_ r i- u/ i_ the\n*_/iu v^aoie Jiup Lnai norn\nins\nNewcastle-On-Tyne, Eng., Jan. 5.?\nThe old cable ship Faraday ended her\ncareer of 47 years of cable laying and cor\nrepairing on the same day on which an<\nthe new cable ship, John W.

It demands\nnationalization of public services, such\n; as railroads, and mines and a better\ni share to labor in the profits of indusI\ntry, but it purposes to gain its ends\n; hy methods that are more ene-getie\ni than those of the old federation.\nIt advocates general strikes carried\nto the bitter end, insurrectional movements,\ninternational agitation and an\nintense anti-militarist campaign.\nThe first act of the new organization\nis expected to be its formal adhesion\nto the Third Internationale of\nI Moscow.\n1921 Year of\nEconomic Battling\nMoscow, Jan. 6.?Nineteen hundred\nand twenty-one has been a year ot\ndiplomatic and economic battling for\nSoviet Russia. It brought the abandonment\nof the government monopoly\nof domestic trading and gradual reversion\nto capitalistic methods, tempered\nin such a way as prevent dangerous\nsplits in the small Communistic\ngroup which dominates the government.\nBut the trade for 1921 has\nbeen many times what it was in 1920,\nand the reopening of shops on the old\ncapitalistic basis has afforded an opportunity\nto sell in a legal way manufactured\narticles which are in great\ndemand.\ni TT 1 1 ??- - \' * *\nnampvrcu uy tne unpie aesire to establish\ntrade relations with important\nforeign powers, to protect the Third\nInternatonale, whose headquarters are\nin Russia and to hold the Communistic\nparty in Russia intact, Lenine and his\nnsociates were in a precarious situation\neven before the drought produced\nwidespread famine in the Volga area.\nKrassin managed to negotiate trade ^\nagreements with England, Germany\nand several minor powers, but the foreign\ntrade commissions which came\nto Russia failed to find the large supplies\nwhich Bolshevist leaders had\nheralded throughout the world. The\nconcession plan which Krassine and\nhis associates had devised did not appeal\nto foreign investors. Confidence\nwas lacking. Old owners had no desire\nto invest more money in factories\nwhich had been taken away from them\nand other foreigners could not be induced\nto take factories whose title was\nclouded.\nThe Bolshevist government lacked\nthe gold necessary to buy abroad and\ncould not find creditors. The government\nannounced it would make import\nand export business possible for individuals\nand corporations, under government\ncontrol. This belated statement\ncame in October. Commissions\nare working out customs tariffs and\n1922 probably will se a far larger export\nand import trade if the government\nmakes good its promise to release\nits grip on foreign business.\nLeslie Urquhart, a British mining\nman, who attempted to obtain concessions\nto work the mining properties\nwhich he controlled in Russia before\nthe Bolshevist regime, said it would\nbe impossible for him to operate in\nRussia until the government stops\nthe activities of the Cheka, or secret\nservice, which he insists is stronger\nj than the central government with\nwhich concessions are negotiated.\nThe Cheka always has had an important\npart in directing foreign trade\narrangements. Many commissioners\nselected by the Foreign Trade Council\nhave not been permitted to leave Russ:a.\nForigners are unabl to understand\nth relations between the Cheka,\nwhich operates under Umslicht, and\nthe socalled central government. It is\nnot clear whether there is a dual government,\nor whether the men who are\ngenerally recognized as heads of the\ngovernment use the Cheka and thus\navoid dfrect blame for acts which\nmeet with public disapproval.\nOfficial figures for the foreign trade\nof Russia during the first nine months\nof this year show that the exports totalled\nroughly 100,000 tons. These\nexports were chiefly raw materials or\npartly manufactured articles, such as\ntimber, railway ties, leather, fur, tar,\nbristles, hair, asbestos and graphite.\nThirty-three per cent of the exports\nwent to England. Forty-si* per cent,\nchiefly wood and flax, went to Latvia\nfor exportation to various countries.\nThe value of goods exported abroad\nfrom January 1 until August 31 was\nabout $1,140,000.\nExperiments Prove Successful\nParis, Jan. 6.?Experiments with\ninternal combustion motors as traction\npower for branch railroad lines\nin France have been so successful that\nthey are to be continued on a larger\nscale.\nOrdinary automobile motors of 40\nto 60 horsepower hauled rural trains\nat -an average speed of 16 miles an\nhour. With higher power motors better\nadapted to traction by rail it is\nthought sufficient speed for all needs\nof local and branch lines will be attained.\nTo a woman of the Marquesas\nislands tattooed legs are the highest\nreach of art.\niMMegBHftwaaaafeBagggeBgaegBgB 11 ? ? * ? aaa a ?
