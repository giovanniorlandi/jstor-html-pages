Cook of the\nMendah-Nevada Mining Co.,\nwas in from that property Wed\nnesday. On hid return he took\nwith " him a number of men,\nwhich will be added to the force\nalready on the ground, also\nsupplies. Mr. Cook wa3 very\njubilant over a new strike made\nin the mine. This strike was\nmade at the lowest workings of\nthe , shaft; being encountered at\nthe 700 foot level. A body of\nore has been opened up, averag\nRumored Strike\nAt Ida May\nIt is being currently rumored\nthat a very large and important\nstrike has been made at the Ida\nMay mine at Bristol. A repre\nsentative of this paper, when\n\' hearing the report, tried to get\nsome confirmation of the same\nbut those in a position to know\nseems to be very reticent con\ncerning the matter. However\nwe are inclined to give much\ncredence to the report because\nof the fact that this mine has\nalways been to the front in the\nproduction of ore. However the\nimportant conditions about this\nstrike is that it is stated to be\nof such a magnitude that no\nquestion remains but that W. A.\nClark, Jr., who holds a bond and\nlease on the property will exercise\nthe same.\nWater Rates\nAre Increased\nThe Pioche\' Water Company\nhas decided to increase the rate\nper month for water hereafter.\nThis decision is alright, shoulp\nthe company reciprocate in im\nproved service. When the in\nhabitants of this, or any other\ntown, pays a fair rate for the\nwater used, they are entitled to\nall the protection from fires that\nwater service can give them.\nSome weeks ago we chronicled\nthe fact that new tanks were to\nbe installed, but see no move in\nthat direction as yet. We be\nlieve that this should be done as\nsoon as possible, for it is appar\nent that the tanks now in use\nare entirely unfit for the pur\npose, both from a sanitary stand\npoint, and as successful water\nconserves. Much water is wast\ned and this will be needed with\nincreased population.\nWe do not presume to dictate\nto any person or corporation, its\npolicy, but when their dealings\nconcern the entire community,\nwe at least assume the right to\npoint out defects; and one little\nsuggestion that might be acted\nupon with good results, is to\nmake a uniform rate, and charge\nall and by so doing a few will\nnot be compelled to bear an\nadded burden in making a sys\ntem pay.\nThe most noticeable raise is\nwith the saloon men. These\nbusiness houses formerly paid\ntwo dollars per month for water,\nbut have been notified that ten\ndollars will be the pr\'cein future.\nTuesday, M. L. Lee, the real\nestate man consumated a deal\nwhereby Henry H. Lee trans\nferred to Frank Vogler lots 18\nand 19 in Block 1 for the consid\neration of $600.00.

The\nengine, recently installed, is be\ning kept steadily employed, hoist\ning the immense tonnage being\nbroken, to the surface and is\ngiving excellent results.\nMr. Cook, while he does not\nwi3h to be understood as boast\ning, is conscientious in his state\nments, that his mine will rank\namong the foremost shippers of\nthe district\nCorrespondence\nFrom the South\nNotes About Our Neigh\nbor in the Lower End\nof the County.\nSEARCHLIGHT. Nev., July\n24 Pursuant to its policy to do\nthings, the management of the\nStanley Forbes Extension has\ninstalled its new camp and will\ncommence aggressive develop\nment work immediately. The\nproperty lies due south adjoin\ning the Stanley Forbes and hav\ning 2,500 feet of the wonderfully\nrich vein that enriches that\nproperty, and ri which such\nbonanza ore has been developed,\nThe work, so far, on the Exten\n3ion has more than shown up\npromising values, as several\npieces of specimen ore has been\nfound while trenching across\nthe monster vein that traverses\nthe Nevada Girl claim owned by\nthe company.\n, G. W. Moyer has left for the\nEast, to arrange for a complete\nequipment of the finest machin\nery obtainable, to facilitate\nrapid development:\' Upon the\narrival of this, work will be hast\nened, as it is the intention of\nSupt Jos. McArthur, to sink to\nwater level on the vein and com\'\nmence extracting the ore.\nTo date, the principal work\nconsists of several prospect\nshafts, .open cuts and many feet\nof trenching, showing three well\ndefined true fissure veins, all\ncarrying excellent values. Good\nhomings can be obtained on the\nsurface all along the vein on the\nNevada Girl for a distance of\n1500 feet At the bottom of a\n40-foot shaft on thisclaim, there\nis three feet of fine looking\nquartz, carry several ounces in\ngold per ton.\nFrom a director of the com\npany it was ascertained that the\nmanagement intend leasing the\nNew Era mill in a short time\nand make a trial run of the ore\nThe Searchlight Comstock, ly\ning about a mile west 01 the\nExtension, is awaiting the ar\nrival of its complement of ma\nchinery, when sinking will .be.\nresumed at once. The recent\nsensational strike on this property\nis holding out well, and at depth\nof 65 feet there is two feet of\nore in the shaft.\nTo Form Chamber\nof Commerce.\nA meeting has been called for\nTuesday night July 30th at 8\no\'clock at the Searchlight Bank\n& Trust Co. for the very worthy\npurpose of discussing plans for\nthe formation of a local Chamber\nof Commerce. The need of such\nan organization has been long\napparent and now that the initia\ntive has been taken it is to be\nhoped that there will be a rous\ning meeting leading up to a per\nmanent organization. Search\nlight Bulletin.\nIs Attracting Atten\ntion. CRECCENT, Nev., July 24.\nCrescent will soon have an\nother mine, worthy of the name,\none that will be producing \' and\nhave a ore tonnage in reserve\nwarrant the most optimistic, in\nbelieving that the Ajax Bullfrog\nwill in a short, time be one of\nthe big mines of Southern Ne\nvada.\nTo the Straub family must be\ngiven all the credit, if the pres\nent predictions, which are well\nwarranted should prove true, as\nthe property was located by a\nStraub, financed, by a Straub\nand developed under the watch\nful eye of another end of the\nStraub family. In fact, every\naction toward the developing of\nthe Wathena claim into a mine\nhas been under the management\nof one of the many wings of the\nStraub family.\nIn the fall of 1905, Frank\nStraub located the Wathena claim\nin Crescent during the early\nexcitement in that District; later,\nfollowed by Chas. Straub, who,\nafter examining the prospect,\nthought so well of it that he in\nvested considerable money to sec\nwhat chances the new find hi Id\nforth. Shipping ore was en\ncountered close to the sun ce,\nand a shipment was made t the\nsmelters that netted the man\nagement $43 per ton, net. This\nwas the incentive to the owners\nto start exten live work, which\nup to date has I en very grati\nfying.\nThe main working shaft is\nnow down over HjO feet with\ndrifts on the 100 and 200 foot\nlevels, running east and west,\nshowing about three feet of fine\nore.. M. L. Cook, mining en\ngineer of Searchlight has just\ncompleted the plans for the fu\nture development, wliich will in\nclude sinking to water level,\nerecting the five stamp mill now\non the ground and blocking out\nsufficient ore to keep the mill\nrunning 24 hours a day after the\nstamps commence dropping.\nIt will take considerable work\nbefore the property is thoroghly\nopened up, but from the manner\nin which the development is now\nproceeding, before many months\nhave passed the music of the\nstamps dropping on ore and\npounding out the bullion will be\nheard at the Ajax Bullfrog.\nRailroad Is\nAt Panaca\nine Kauroaa nas oeen com\npleted to Panaca and the forces\nare now busy constructing the\nsiding at that point\' This place\nwill be the shipping point for\nPioche and surrounding districts\nduring the summer or until such\ntime as the road is completed to\nPioche. Many rumors are heard\nto the effect that construction\nwill be stopped for the present\nbut these are not borne out by\nthe facts. On the contrary the\nintention of the road seem to be\nentirely different They have\ntelegraphed for more men and\nwill increase the force, indi\ncating their intention to get\nthrough as quickly as possible.\nThis seems to be consistent with\ngood business principals. Pioche\nis the object point What idea\nwould they have in getting part\nway? " None whatever that we\ncan see. Pioche is going to have\na Railroad day and that before\nthe snow flies.\n, A load of supplies and a num\nber of men left here Wednesday\nmorning for the property of the\nBristol-Pioche Company in the\nBristol district A vigorous\ncampaign of development work\nhas been outlined and will be\npushed as rapidly as possible.\nMONDAY.\nTwo agreement from Las\nVegas.

S. Anderson\nHas Returned\nWell Pleased With Property\nand Progress Being\nMade.\nW. S. Anderson, the Pioche\nhustler, came in from Ely the\nother day in his touring car, that\nis, to be more explicit, he came\npart way in the car, and the re\nmainder, well, he came that in\nthe car, but there happened to\nbe a team hitched to the front\nfurnishing the propelling power.\nWhen seen by a representative\nof this paper, Mr. Anderson ex\npressed himself as being well\npleased with the work and re\nsultant showing on the different\nproperties in which he is inter\nested. He was the organizer of\nthe Columbus-Pioche and the\nGeorgia-Pioche Mining Compan\nies. Of the latter DroDertv. he\nspeaks in most pronounced terms\nand is determined to make a\ngreat producer of it as soon as\npossible. For that purpose he\nhas ample means. Dr. Thomas\nN. Baker, who recently visited\nthe property with Mr. Anderson,\nand who owns a large interest\nin it was so pleased with the\nshowing that he stated before\nleaving that he would, if neces\nsary, advance any required sum\nof money to fully develop the\nproperty. ,\nThe work is going ahead\nrapidly under the efficient super\nvision of Superintendent Mahedy\nand as soon as conditions justify,\nan increased force will be put on\nat the mine. Mr. Anderson will\nleave in a few days for the\nSouth for the purpose of looking\nafter the details of the organiz\nation of some new companies\nwhich he has under way.\nWith Each Day\'s Devel\nopment. The magnificent showing at\nthe Susan Duster mine, belong\ning the Ohio-Kentucky Company\nis constantly on the increase.\nCommencing at the 100 foot\nlevel and continuing thence to\nthe three hundred or lower level,\nit is one great gigantic ore body\nof good values. Drifts have\nbeen run along the lead from\nthese levels and the ore has been\nproven to exist in exceedingly\nlarge bodies. This great show\ning means much for Pioche,\nwhen we stop to consider that\nthe strike is made in what may\nbe termed virgin territory, it\nfully substatiates the theory that\nPioche has not been fairly pros\npected.\nAt present on the 300 foot\nlevel a winze is being sunk for\nthe purpose of determining the\nextent of the ore body at that\npoint, but so far, has not been\npassed and continues of a very\nhigh grade.\nThomarson Ties\nUp New Claims\nGroup of Mines in Quartz\nMountain Secured.\nMrs. Elvira Craw, Frank\nPasina, I. N. Garrison and H.\nT. Tranmer have disposed of a\ngroup of claims, situate in\nQuartz Mountain, under lease\nand bond, to Edward Thomar\nson. The necessary papers\nbinding the deal were excuted\nduring the week.\'\' :\nThe claims bonded consist of\nthe Quartz Spring lodes, Nos. 1\nto 8, inclusive. They are situate\nseven and a half miles from\nCraw\'s Ranch, and about\ntwenty-three miles in a north\nwesterly direction from Pioche.\nThe claims are said to have a\nvery promising showing, that\nwill justify extensive develop\nment work. Upon Mr. Thomar\nson \'s return from the East work\nwill be inaugurated upon the\nproperty. It i3 the intention to\nincorporate a company to handle\nthe claims and the preliminary\nsteps in this direction have been\ntaken.\nImprovement In\nTelegraph Line\nWe are informed that\nmuch needed improvement in the\ntelegraph service will be given\nPioche in the near future. The\nSuperintendent of Telegraph for\nthe Salt Lake. Route and also\nSuperintendent for the Western\nUnion stationed at Los Angeles\nwere over the Pioche & Caliente\nRailway right of way as far as\nPanaca the other day. It is\nstated that the intention is to\nconstruct a line as far as Panaca\nand connect with the line run\nning to Pioche thus assuring that\nthe line will be in commission\nwhen needed. As it has been in\nthe past the line could not be de\npended on and the connections\nat Modena were not at all as\nthey should be. The office is a\npaying one and the company is\njustified in keeping the line in\nfirst class order which they\nshould do.\nS. W. Vance, a Pioche mining\nman and who is connected with\nthe Bristol-Pioche company,, left\nfor Yellowstone Park the fore\npart of the week on a pleasure\ntrip and expects to be gone for\nsome weeks.\nThe oil strike reported in our\nlast issue as occuring at Virgin\nCity in Southern Utah, is attract\ning attention in Pioche. A\nnumber of our residents control\ninterests there of which the dis\ncovery will greatly enhance the\nvalue.\nOne of the Largest Deposits In Pioche Dis\ntrict Developed\nThe Prince mine beloneinsr to\nthe Phoenix Reduction Company.\nwhich is situate about four miles\nin a southeasterly direction from\nPioche, is responding very nicely\nto development under way. . The\nshaft has now reached a depth\nof 160 feet and is all in ore. This\nLos Angeles\nMan Here\nStates There is an Excel\nlent Opportunity For\nLumber Yard.\nMr. H. E. Crawford, repre\nsenting the Blinn-Robinson Lum\nber Company of Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, has been in Pioche\nthe past week, looking over the\nbusiness possibilities in his line\nhere. From examination so far\nmade, Mr. Crawford believes\nthat an excellent opportunity is\nopen tor a hrst-class down to\ndate lumber yard. While it is\nnot the policy of \' his company to\ninstall retail yards, rather per-\nferring to sell at wholesale, he\nbeliever that after making a re\nport on the conditions, unless\nsomeone takes the matter ud.\nhis company will be temt)ted to\ninstall a yard. The company\nrepresented by Mr. Crawford do\nthriving business throughout\nCalifornia and Nevada, handling\nall classes of Washington, Ore\ngon and red pine lumber.\nMr. Crawford states that\nPioche is attracting considerable\nattention among the business\nmen of Los Angeles and that\nwith the completion of the rail\nroad, they will be\' found on the\nground in keen competition for\nthe business here. Freight rates\nwill be about the same and the\nbusiness will go to the town giv\ning the best satisfaction and\nprompt attention.\nTramway For\nBristol Con.\nAll the fixtures have been\nordered for the tramway to be\nbuilt by the Bristol Consolidated\nCompany at Bristol. The tram\nway will be used for the purpose\nof transporting the ores over the\nmountain from the mines to\npoint near Jackrabbit and will\nconnect with the railroad. This\nwill prove a very economical\nmeans of transportation as well\nas affording an opportunity of\nhandling the immense tonnage\nat the mines.\nExhibits Good\nLooking Rock.\nM. D. Mapes\nsome .very fine\nwa3 exhibiting\nrock this last\nweek taken rom his property in\nthe Bristol Distnct. Mr. Mapes\nhas a group of six claims upon\nwhich he has just completed the\nassessment work. The vein\nfrom which the rock exhibited\nwas taken, was uncovered at a\ndepth of a very few feet, and\nshows up immense. The rock\nis heavy in lead and carries good\nsilver values giving an average\nassay of over $101.00. Mr Mapes\nstated that he didn\'t have any\nthing to say concerning his prop\nerty at present firmly beleiving\nthat its merit will attract all the\nattention necessary and that\nvery soon.\nN. J. Wadsworth of Panaca has\nsecured a contract for 1,000\ncords of wood, to be delivered\nto the Nevada-Utah Corporation,\nHe has commenced to f ulfill the\ncontract and has a force of eight\nchoppers at work.\nore will give an average assay\nof 150 ounces in silver to the\nton, as well, as carrying good\nlead vacie3rwd the entire lot\nmay be said to be good shipping\nore. The owners are well pleas\ned with the mine and know that\nin it they have a bonanza.\nAnother Road\nFor Pioche\nII. S. Woolley Says One Will\nBe Built From Coal\nfields In Utah.\nH. S Woolley, presidat.t of the\nWoolley Exploration Company, in\nan extended interview with the\nMining Record of Denver, gives\nsome interesting facts concern\ning railroads in Nevada, as to\nearnings of the new constructed\nroads he says: \'\nNevada railways pays their\ncost of construction inside of one\nyear. The railroad connecting\nGoldfield and Tonopah paid for\ntself inside of six months, while\nthe railroad built from Sodaville\nto Tonopah paid for itself inside\nof the first year, and it has been\npaying over 100 per cent a year\nin dividends ever since."\nMr. Woolley beleives that the\none great problem to be solved\nby Nevada mining camps is that\n01 transportation and fuel and\nthat in solving one you get the\nother. He believes that the\ngreat distance that fuel is hauled\nat present is entirely unnecessary\nand for the purpose of reducing\nthis haul his company will build\na road from the coal fields in\nsouthern Utah which will con\nnect with all the important min\ning towns of southern Nevada.\nThe road will be about 350 mile3\nin length and will connect Ely, \'\nPioche and other southern camps.\nWith relation to the road and\nPJche he says "Pioche will be\nreached within less than 75\nmiles" and he concludes the in\nterview with the encouraging\nstatement "We are going to\nbuild the railroad now, and that\nwill lead on to other things.\nJust watch our operations for\nprofits that will scare you."\nGet Lease\nOn Fortuna\nChas. Fernander, Jos. Vietti\nand F. R. McNamee have secured\na lease on the Fortupa mine in\nJackrabbit district This mine\nat present belongs to the Bam\nberger Exploration Company\nand i3 considered one of the most\npromising mines in the district\nThe property is a copper proposi\ntion and much rich copperjore is\nnow blocked out. The mine has\nbeeli worked f dr many years in a\nsmall way and some money made\nout of it being owned for a\nnumber of years by Wesley Wil\nliams and Joseph JCook two old\ntimers of this section who sold\nit for a very substantial consider\nation. We are pleased to see\nleasers fgetting in, for it is a\nproven fact that they bring the\nmerits of a district to the front\nin a more forceable manner than\nany other thing that can happen.\nMany of our local nimrodsare\neither out in the mountains on\na hunting trip, or contemplate\nleaving in a few days.

The\ndumps are all full and the teams\nhauling to the mills cannot keep\nthem clear. Since the advent of\nsteam engines for hoisting pur\nposes in this camp, the amount\nof ore raised from the shafts\nwhere they are used, have been\ndoubled, and sinking and pros\npecting is also being pushed\nrapidly ahead. New discov\n1 at\nenes ot large bodies 01 ore are\nconstaHtly being made, and pri.\nvate claims are looking up and\ninviting attention. Severn\nparties representing capitalists\nof the East and West have been\nrecently visiting the camp and\nmaking personal observations,\npreparatory to reporting at\nheadquarters, and in every m\nstance they speak in the highest\nterms of our resources and the\nsuperior advantages offered for\ninvestment. Ere long we may\nexpect to see a new era com\nmence in Pioche, as capital will\nsoon pour in and develop fully\nour hitherto but partially ex\nplored wealth.\nSix Days Run During a per\niod of six days, the Raymond &\nEly mill at Bullionville, produced\nbullion valued at $25,674.98.\nThe amount can be produced\nregularly with the same quality\nof rock now coming out of the\ncompany\'s mines. The Lightner\nshaft alone can supply the mill\nto its full capacity. The mines\nof this company are at present\nraising sufficient ore to run sev\neral custom mills in addition to\ntheir 20-stamp mill.\nIndian Agent for Pioche Ma\njor C. F.

The all important ques\ntion will be the consideration of\nthe refunding measure. Repre\nsentatives of the bond holders\nand prospective purchasers have\nbeen urging the Board for some\ntime to take action. - The Com\nmissioners however, have follow\ned the only wise plan and that is\nthey have refused to take action\nuntil such . time aa they were\nthouroughly familiar with every\ndetail and the interested parties\nhave recognized the wisdom of\ncourse. They have promised , to\ntake some definite action at phe\nmeeting Monday and each one\nhas been in consultation with an\nattorney relative to the same;\nDistrict Attorney Horsey has\nbeen making a study of , the\nmeasure the past week and we\nfeel assured that whatever : is\ndone will be in a careful and in\ntelligent manner.

The\nfigure at which it is made pos\nsible this time, is much lower\nthan will be our opportunity\nagain. This lact seems very ap\nparent when the growth of the\nCounty is taken into considera\ntion and the phenominal increase\nin valuations.

The\ntime to handle such practices as\nthese is to get them at the start\nand keep them down. It is a\nnewspaper\'s duty to lend an as\nsisting hand to legitimate con\ncerns, and just as much its duty\nto protect it from frauds. We\nhave had no such practice in\nPioche, but will not be long in\nasserting our position should it\nbecome necessary.\nThe following article taken\nfrom the News show how very\nanxious thvWcCor l pocplo are\nto keep the matter quijt.\n"Word was received here this\nweek that Mrs. Anna Mallory,\nwho threatened suit against the\nH. H. McCord Company on , the\ncharge of. getting money under\nfalse pretense and through gross\nmisrepresentation, has . settled\nthe matter out of court. To\navoid the publicity of court pro\nceedings, the mcuord company\nwas eager to adjust the difficulty\nand Mrs. Mallory says they re\nfunded her $900, which was the\namount she paid in part pay\nment on several lots on the hill\nside of Doherty Mountain. This\nground is so covered with mam\nmoth boulders that it is an im\npossibility to drive a saddle horse\nthrough the property.\n\' \' \'The fraud was so palpable that\nMcCord was willing to disgorge\nif the facts were suppressed.\nThis is only one of several cases\nwhere an investor demanded\nand received his money back or\nlet the company face an action\nfor fraud, which in every in\nstance they feared to do." \'\nI\n..-.-.\nAffidavits of labor, mining and\nreal estate deeds and location\nnotices for sale at the Record.\nNotice.\nM.
