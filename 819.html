The process is analogous\nto that by whicl\' galls az\'i other vege\ntable excrescence are formed. Mr. O.\nF.

Miss Elinor\nCutting Hamlin, of Hrookllne, Mass.,\nwho Is his only direct descendant, will\ncome Into possession of a notable col\nlection of Maine gems, in addition to\na famous necklace which she has, and\nwhich, It is said, cannot be duplicated\nin any museum In Europe.\nThis necklace, says a Bangor (Me.)\nreport to the New York Sun, Is of\nMaine tourmalines, and Includes Home\nof the finest of those gems which have\nbeen taken from Mount Mica, Me.,\nsince the discovery in 1820 of this mine\nof precious stones by E. L. Hamlin\nand his brother, Hannibal Hamlin, at\none time vice president of the United\nStates. In the necklace Is the first\ngem found by them 84 years ago.\nThe necklace is composed of 17\nlarge tourmalines, ranging from three\nto 30 carats, each attached to a chain\nof gold, and arranged so that they can\nbe detached at will, and their places\ntaken by others of different sizes.\nIn the set are 30 additional stones,\nmany being mounted with white tour\nmalines and beryls. There are also a\ncross and two eardrops, the former\ncomposed of six of the finest tourma\nlines yet found. The stones being\nabout three carats each and of vari\nous colors. The eardrops are of green\nand pink tourmalines, set with white\nberyls.\nMany of these stones were exhibited\nby Gen William B. Franklin, commis\nsioner at the Paris exposition in 1889,\nand they were also shown In the dis\nplay of American gems at the world\'s\nfair In Chicago.\nThere are several fine collections In\nMaine outside the Hamlin family, and\nwithin the last few. years local pride\nIn the resources of the state, particu\nlarly in regard to its gems, has be\ncome so great that In many villages\nand towns the women will not wear\nanv other ornament.\nPOLICEMAN AND DIRECTORY\nOfficer Monopolizes Public Book to\nthe Disgust of Anxious\nCitizens.\nWhat a convenience is a public city\ndirectory except when it becomes an\namaing source of prolonged vexation.\nTake, for instance, the one at Dear\nborn station, says the Chicago Record\nHerald. A day or so ago a passer-by\nhurried in to consult it, only (o find a\npoliceman standing over the book,\nwhile two people were In line impa\ntiently awaiting their turn. The offi\ncer, perhaps made indifferent to the\nwants of the public by his "profes\nsion," heeded them not. It was evi\ndently his lunch hour, and he was put\nting in spare time in the Improvement\nof his mind.\nAnother man joined the line. He\nwas waiting for a train and wanted to\nkill time. Still the policeman contin\nued to pore over the volume with all\nthe intensity of a newsboy studying a\n"dope" sheet.\nNo. 1 In the line looked out the door\nand. seeing a car about to start up\nDearoorn street, hurried away. No. 2\nnow moved up toward the directory,\nmaking a noisy show of Impatience to\ndistract the mind of the reader. The\npoliceman looked up, but it was with a\nfar-away expression as though he were\ncalculating who woild be the next\nboss of the ward.\nAs the officer turned back to the\nbook No. 3 consulted his watch and\nwas ftone. No. 4 si ned to be a very\npatient individual, so he may have suc\nceeded In getting the information he\ndesired from the directory.\nCANAL LOCKS IN CHINA.\nCrude Contrivsncee in Use on the\n"Grand" Waterway of That\nCountry.\nSome of the primitive methods in\nuse in China are entertainingly de\nscribed In an article, "The Grand Canal\nof China," In the Technical World\nMagazine.\nThe contrivances for locks along the\ncanal are very simple stout boards,\nwith ropes at each end of them, being\nlet down edgewise over each other\nthrough grooves In the stone piers.\nBoats are dragged through and up the\nsluices by means of ropes communicat\ning with large windlas-ses worked on\nthe bank, which haul them safely but\nvery slowly. Artificial basins were hol\nlowed out in the banks of the canal at\nthese locks, where boats might anchor\nsecurely. The sluices which keep the\nnecessary level are of very rude con\nstruction. Soldiers and workmen are\nconstantly in attendance at these\nsluices, and the danger to boats is\ndiminished by coils of rope hung down\nat the sides to break the force of pos\nsible blows.\nLondon Suburb.\nf&r more sham culture is apparent\nat a gathering of literary people In\ntown than Is ever displayed by non\nliterary people in suburban drawing\nrooms; far more meanness of outlook,\npettiness of living, struggling for sole\nly material ends are associated with\nBelgravla and Mayfalr than ever pone- j\ntrpte to those fearful wilds of Belt\nton or Crouch-end.

Mexico with\nits equable climate offers to the auto\nmobilist an ideal condition in this re\nspect. And when to this Is added good\nroads ami paved streets nothing more\ncould be desired in the way of natural\nor artificial conditions.\nAn automobile club has been formed\nin the City of Mexico, with a member\nship of 300 enthusiasts of different na\ntionalities, who are determined to\nbring about a system of good roads.\nThe monthly automobile tax in the\nCity of Mexico is eight dollars each,\nand the club above mentioned has in\nduced the government to use the entire\nreceipts from this source in the im\nprovement of roads and driveways In\nand fcbout the capital city. President\nDiaz is the possessor of a Pope-Toledo\nlandadlette. which is often seen about\nthe capital, and Thomas Moran. an\nAmerican banker, makes constant use\nof his car of the same type.\nOne of the most interesting and pic\nturesque rides to be found in the\nworld is that from the capital to the\nhist\nove\nIt VI\nsine\nlc old city of Cuernavae.a. jusi\nhe mountains to the southwest,\ni founded by Cortez and has ever\nbeen frequented by tourists as\nwell as residents of Mexican cities in\nsearch of rest and health.\nACCIDENTS AND FATIGUE.\nNumber of Casualties Greater in the\nForenoon Than After Mid\nDay Rest.\nIt was\niwn by an exhaustive In\nquiry of the subject in France, says\nCassier\'s Magazine, that the number of\naccidents increases progressively hour\nby hour during the first half day; that\nafter the rest at midday the number of\naccidents is notably less than in the\nlast hour of the forenoon; that in the\ncourse of the second half day accidents\nagain become, from hour to hour, pro\ngressively more numerous, and that\nthe maximum number of accidents to\nward the end of the oecond half day is\nnotably higher than the corresponding\nmaximum in the morning. The influ\nence of the workmen\'s fatigue on the\nprodjetion of accidents stands out\nclearly from these observations, and It\nis easy to understand how this comes\nabout when it is remembered that with\nfatigue the attention readily dimin\nishes and disappears. The conclusion\ntherefore, is that in order to produce\na diminution in the number of acci\ndents it would be sufficient to interca\nlate in the middle of each half day of\nwork a period of repose, naturally not\nso \'.ong as that at midday, but the\nlength of which remains to be deter\nmined. In fact, one would only have\nto apply to the manual labor of adults\nthe measures which for a long time\nhave been put into practice for chil\ndren ss regards their intellectual labor.\nCHANCES MARK OF FAME.\nIndiana Town Once Noted for Bace\nTrack Now Known for\nRace Suicide.\nThe little town of Roby.
