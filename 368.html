When the\nconference report on the Raliroad\nrate bill was taken up today, the\nconference amendment received the\nattention of Senator Spooner. In\nthe main he endorsed the prohibition\nof passes, but he contended that\nthere should be exceptions, including\nrailroad employes. Congress had no\nrifihl, be said, to step between the\nemployer and employe. "There is\nno sense in the provision as it\nstands," he said. "The railroads\nshould be allowed to perforin acts\nof common humanity. It should be\nelastic." Spooner also spoke of the\nimportance of including members of\nthe railroad Y. M. C. A. as persons\nentitled to passes and Tilinan sny\n;:ested that it was necessary to draw\nthe line somewhcic. lie would have\nthe exceptions limited to railroad\nemployes and their families and Sen\nator Hale took the same view.\nPLAIN M\'ALESTES.
