B.-Shareholders\nIn the English railways have been\nfrightened by an article by an Ameri\ncan, Just published In the Times,\nthrowing doubt on the solvency of the\nrailway systems of this country, says\na Tribune dispatch from London. A\nlarge number of selling orders were\nreceived on the stock exchange. The\nBritish railway shareholder has to\nface an ugly prospect, and he is by\nno means free from responsibility for\nthe situation in which he became In\nvolved. The charge of overcapitaliza\ntion which has been so frequently\nbrought against the British railway\ncommittees certainly is not exagger\nated, but has a considerable founda\ntion of truth.\nThe shareholder is always on the\nSide of a liberal division of profits\nwhen Improvements are required, not\nto obtain an increase of trade, but\nmerely to maintain the existing post-\nLittle Children\ncan safely take this famous well\nknown remedy.
