Gap*\ntain Wall G. Bronaogh, of Clinton,\nMo., for a quarter of a century has\nspent time and money in a persist\nent effort to secure the liberty of\nCole and Jim Younger, who have\nbeen confined in the Stillwater Pen\nitentiary for the Korthfleld Bank\nrobbery, and at last he has succeed-\'\ned. * 1\nTbronghontwfekssonri the ques\ntion has been repeatedly asked,\n“Why does Bronaogh take such\ngreat interest in seenring the free\ndom of the Yonngers ? Is he a rel\native "No.” "Is he a paid at\ntorney?” "No.” The answer\nmay be fonnd in Joaqain Miller\'s\nlines :\nThe standing side by side till death.\nThe dying of some wounded friend.\nThe faith that failed not till the end.\nThe strong endurance till the breath\nAnd body take their ways apart.\n1 only know.\nTheir faults—men have them by heart:\nTheir virtues—they arc with the dust.\nBronauyh Sacrificed\nTime ami Money.\nActuated by a friendship born of\nthe comradeship ot the Civil War,\nCaptain Bronaogh has sacrificed\nnot only bis time, bat s great deal\nof his own private fortune in the\neffort in behalf of the Yonngers\nwhich has just culminated in suc\ncess.\nHe was the first man to grasp the\nhand of two of Quantrell’s most dar\ning men after the Minnesota Par\ndon Board had granted them pa\nrole. It was befitting that their\nlife-long friend should have first\nbroken the glad tidings to the hun\ngered men, who had not tasted the\nsweets of liberty in twenty-five\nyears.\nWhen at last the prison garb was\nchanged to oitixens\' clothes, and\nthey walked forth free men, they\nleft the prieon wall on either arm of\nCaptain Bronaogh, who bad stood\nfaithfully by them when farther\nfight for their freedom seemed use\nless.\nThree Legislatures\n\'Made Petition.\nUndaunted by repeated failure,\nBronaogh persistently brought pe\ntitions from three Missouri Legis\nlatures in behalf of the Yonngers,\nswelled the volume of appeal for\nmercy by obtaining letters from\nprominent men in Miesoari poli\ntics, in basineec, in law, from all\nreligions beliefs and political creeds,\nfrom men who had worn the gray\nand foaght side by side with the\nprisoners and men who wore the\nbine and had foaght against them.\nIt took a quarter of a century for\ntime to heal the woond that bad in\ncensed the State of Minnesota, bat\nconstant dropping will wear away\nthe stone, and so, little by little,\nhatred to pity, and pity\nmelted into \'coqipaaion, and the\nmost bitter of the Young\ner* in Minnesota %ae to be their\nmost ardent frienda\'and signed the\npetition for their parole.\ns&a.

In 1861 some\nKansas troops under Jennison for\ncibly seized the horses in his stable,\nand when he remonstrated, shot him\ndead in the street. Hie eons, mad\ndened by the outrage, joined Quan\ntrell’s band of guerrillas and there\nlearned the lessons which cola mat\ned in the crime at Northfield, which\nthey expiated in Stillwater Peni\ntentiary.\nDeeds of Violence\nCreated Qnantrell.\nQnantrell bad been driven to\ndeeds of violence by a similar out\nrage, and to bis banner flocked men\nin whose hearts a aavage hatred had\nibeen planted by rnthlesa trampling\nupon their affections and rights by\nthe Kansas Jayhawkere and other\ndesperados who disgraced the bine.\nThese men bad come to believe tbat\nthe Stars and Stripes and the bine\nuniform stood only for murder, rap\nine and plunder. They came to\nhate both. Everything that was\nassociated with either was to them\nan object of the most intense\naversion. In time they were con\nsumed with the feverish desire to\nwreak vengeance on any one who\nwore the bine uniform. Itwaa a\nvendetta of hate, born of past wrong.\nCole Younger\nOnce Saved Elkins.\nOne day. daring the war, Quan\ntrell’s men captured several prison\ners, after a sharp brash with some\nUnion troops. One prisoner was\nStephen B. Elkins, now of West\nVirginia. He knew the Youngers\nbefore She civil conflict, and when\nhe was turned over to Cole, with\ninstructions that he be taken to the\nrear, which in the parlance of the\nQnantrell band meant execution,\nbe knew be bad a good thing and\nescaped with his life. Sore enough,\nwhen Cole Yonnger had taken his\nprisoner behind the main body of\nQaantrell’s men, he fired a shot in\nthe air, and then told Elkins to run\nfor hie life, which be did.\nWhen the war ended, the Young\ners and the James boys found them\nselves hunted with a price upon\ntheir heade.\nBailor the Object of\nAttack on North field.\nBen Bntler, whose deeds incensed\nevery eon of the South, was an es\npecial object of hatred to the men\nwho wore the gray. When it was\nlearned that be had deposited a\nlarge sum of money in the North\nfield bank, a plot was formed to rob\nit. Ben Bntler was more the ob\nject in this raid than the mere mat\nter of gaining so many thousands\nof dollars. The history of the at\ntack, the killing of the cashier, the\nwounding of Bob Younger, the kill\ning of two of the raiders in the\nstreet fight, the desperate pursuit,\nformed one of the meet thrilling\nchapters in the wild history of the\nJames freebooters of the West.\nAttack on the Bank\nAnd Street Fight.\nOn the afternoon of the Centen\nnial year, September 7,1876, eight\nmen, well mounted, rode into North\nfield. Five of them approached the\nbank, three entered, two remained\nontaide. J. S. Allen, a hardware\ndealer, and Dr. H. H. Wheeler had\nnoticed the peculiar aotamm of the\nmen and started to follow the men\nin the bank, but were thrust back.\nThey immediately ran around the\ncorner and gave the alarm. Citi\nsens poured toward the bank from\nevery direction, bnt a few rifle shots\nfrom the outside pickets served\nto send most of them indoors.\nThe (hooting aroused * citizens in\nother parte of the town, who came\nrunning into the street. The three\nmen who had been held in reserve\nthen dashed npon the scene and\nifoded their Ure to the two pickets\noutside. The cashier of the bank\nattempting to defend himself and\nthe property was slain. A volley\nfired upon the robbers killed Bob\nYonoger’e horse and wounded bis\nrider, who fell helpless under his\nsteed. Cole Younger was also j\nwounded, but despite- his injury, ;\ndespite the increasing rain of bul\nlets, with the stoicism of an Indian, :\nbe walked across the street, leading\nhis horse to the side of his brother |\nBob, lifted him out from under his\nhorse, turned now and then to fire :\na shot to prevent the citizens from j\ncoming too close, dragged bis j\nbrother from under the horse, I\nmounted his own, got Bob on be\nhind and rode away with his com\npanions in the face of the most\nfurious fusilade ever experienced\nby any man in any battle. Then\nbegan a pursuit whose thrilling\nchapters have made history in the\nNorthwest. Five hundred men had I\ngathered on the street immediately j\nafter the tragedy. Sheriff Murphy i\ncalled for volunteers as a posse to\ncapture the bandits, only six re\nsponding. At the head of these\nMorphy started in pursuit. Min- j\nnesota is a country of lakes and |\nswamps; it is difficult for hunted\nmen to find their refnge. The\nbandits had several hours the best\nof the stayt. In a strange land,\nthey were afraid to ask for shelter\nand food, and awaited nightfall\nthat they might obtain sustenance |\nby stealth.\nOne night Cole Younger, Bob!\nYonnger, Jim Younger, William i\nStile, Charles Pitts, and, it is said, j\nJesse James and Frank James hsd\njust crossed a bridge over a river, |\nwhen they heard the posse close be\nhind in pursuit. They hsd barely I\ntime to plunge into the water with\ntheir clothes on, and hold their i\nheads out to breathe, when the pur\nsuers came upon the bridge. One\nof them remarked :\n“They are close around here\nsomewhere.”\n“No, I do not believe they are,”\nreplied a voice.\n“1 bet they are within 100 feet of\nhere,” said the first voice.\nFinally they rode away, and the\nfugitives emerged from the water.\nBattle Precedes\nCapture of Fugitives.\nWhen the posse came upon the\nfugitives they were under an em\nbankment. Bob Younger, who had\nbeen shot in the arm, was a very\n■ick man. His wound had had no\nmedical attention, and bis arm was\nblack. Cole’s vonnd was not so\nserious. As soon as the posse\ncaught sight of them they opened\nfire. Charles Fitts replied in kind,\nand then began a desperate en\ncounter. Charles Pitts was killed,\nriddled with bullets. One of the\nposse was slain. William Stiles\ni was. slain. Then Boh Younger\nstood upright aod said “We sur\nrender.” But even after they\nhoisted the white flag one of the\nposse continued to fire on the ban\ndits. Bob addressed himself to the\nSheriff, and said: “Won’t you\nmake that damned .coward over\nthere stop shooting at us? We\nhave surrendered, but he continues\n> to fire.” The Sheriff commanded\nhim to stop, and the prisoners were\ntaken back to Northfield. They\ni were in a pitiful condition. They\nhad abandoned their horses, and in\ntheir wanderings through the coun\ntry their shoes had been worn away\nand their feet were bleeding. They\nwere in rags; they were half starved.\n. Cole and Jim Would\n, Not Forsake Bob.\nCole and Jim Younger might\n> have escaped from Minnesota had\n1 they followed the suggestion of a\nmember of the band, who advised\n| that they kill or desert Bob, who\nwaa practically helpless from bia\nwound, that they might continue\ntheir fight unhampered.\nBat, loyal to their wounded\nbrother, they refuted to litten to\nanch a suggestion. They would\nnot even consider a plan to abandon\nbim to the tender mercies of the\npursuers, for they feared that the\nfete which would meet the wound\ned man might be worse than death.\nThat inch fears were groundless it\nshew* by, the subsequent treatment\nof the prisoners in Minnesota.\nLoyal to his friends and Bob\nYounger, Charles Pitts remained\nwith them to the end.\nWhen the posse captured the i\nYounger brothers and killed Char\nles Pitts, they made a rigorous\nsearch in the vicinity for the other\ntwo bandits, but without success.\nIt is related iu the lore of Min\nnesota that the missing men wero\nJesse and Frank James, and thrill- •\ning stories have coupled their names\nwith several daring adventures\nwhich ultimately afforded them es\ncape from the State.\nDoctor Forced to Set\nFrank James Leg.\nIt is related that Frank James\nleg was broken in the fight at Still\nwater, and that Jesse bad a diffi\ncult time in making progress out\nof the country with his wounded\nbrother.\nWithout medical attention the\ninjury bad become very severe, and\nFrank was \'snffering considerable.\nOne day, while traveling along a\nlonely Minnesota road, the James\nbrothers spied a traveler in a buggy\nwho evidently was a doctor, and\nbad been to see a patient, for bis\nmedicine case and surgical instru\nments were by his side on the seat\nof the buggy. They halted biro,\nand the doctor was sternly request\ned to dress the injury, which he\ndid without asking any questions,\nfor he realized that silent compli\nance was the only means of saving\nbis life.\nFrank’s wound was dressed end\nbandaged, according to the story,\nand then the doctor’s horse wss un\nharnessed from the baggy and\nturned loose in the road to wander\nhome alone; the buggy was rolled\ninto a lake, and Frank and Jesse\nJames bid the accommodating phy\nsician au revoir, and rode blithely\naway.\nIt required but a short time for\ntheir trial, conviction and sentence\nto life imprisonment. Cole after\nwards related as an incident of the\npursuit what a narrow escape a\nmerchant of Fairbanlt had in a barn\nwhere he and his comrades were\nhidden.\nOne of the pursuers had an idea\nthat the men were hidden in this\nbarn, and came in to search for\nthem. They were carefully con\ncealed under the hay. Charles\nPitts and Cole Younger were lying\nside by side. Pitts wss convinced\nthat they were discovered, sod be\nwhispered to Younger that he was\ngoing to kill that fellow the next\ntime they patted the window.\nYounger told him not to do it, but\nPitta leveled bis revolver through\nthe bay, but Cole Younger pot bis\nfinger under the hammer, and the\nman’s life was saved. The posse\nmaa suddenly became convinced\nthat they were not in the barn, and\nsoon afterwards departed.\nBeginning of Battle\nto Free the Younger*,\nAfter their sentence, began the\nbattle for their freedom, led by\nCaptain Wall C. Bronoogh and\nother prominent men of Missouri\nand the Southwest.\nHundreds of letters were obtain\ned and placed on file before the\nPardon Board and the Governor\nof Minnesota.\nSimultaneously a petition wss\ncirculated among the legislators,\nand the wording of the aame has\nremained unchanged through three\nsuccessive assemblies.\nPetition Pleading\nfor Mercy.\nThis is the appeal carried repeat\nedly to Minnesota by Bronaogh ;\n“To the Honorable Board of\nPardon for the State of Minnesota,\nvia: ilia Excellency D.

He\nis an open and above-board local boss\nand politician that takes bis medicine\nstraight and never saccharines the pill\nwith reform coating. No doubt bis ris\nibilities over the humor of the situation\nkeep him awake of sights.\nIn moving to make unanimous the\nnomination of J. Frank Turner for the\nClerkship to the Court of Appeals, Jas.\nJ. Oreenwel), of this county, made a neat\nand appropriate speech that the conven\ntion warmly applauded. Mr.Oreenwell\npaid a glowing tribute to the late J.\nFrank Ford and said that Southern Ma\nryland had honored him beyond bis\nmost sanguine expectations in putting\nhim forward and supporting hm as its\nchoice to succeed such a man as Mr.\nFord.\nThe steel worker* of the Union have\nengaged in a great battle with the mil\nlionaire steel manufacturers. The de\nvelopments of the past few days have\nbeen but the preliminary skirmishes that\nprecede the real conflict. Both sides to\nthe quarrel seem to be equally deter\nmined and announce that “no quarter\nwill be given or taken.** In the mean\ntime thousands of men will be thrown\nout of work and thousands of women\nand children will suffer. Capital can\nand will take care of its own, while la\nbor will soon exhaust its scanty store.\nWe believe that the Democratic plat\nform bits the nail on the head when it\nsays of tbe amendments to the election\nlaw: they are “in all respects impartial,\nfair and just; that they will do much to\npurify and elevate tbe suffrage and\nmake the votes cast what .for many\nyears they have not been —tbe real ex\npreaaion of the will of each and every\nvoter." The confidence of each party\nin its success in tbe coming campaign\nis a remarkable tribute to the fairness\nof the law. If tbe old law bad remain\ned in force we do not think that demo\ncratic tickets would have been named\nin some Southern Maryland counties.\nThe republican ticket, placed in nom\nination Tuesday, July 20th, ultimo, at\nLeonardtown will require earnest, ac\ntive, concerted and harmonious effoit\non tbe part of democrats to compass its\ndefeat. It is evidently a compromise\nticket and its makeup shows that tbe\nMudd and anti-Mudd factions have ar\nrived at an understanding. What that\nunderstanding is, of course we do not\nknow. But it is evident that many who\na short time ago were denouncing Con\ngressman Mudd as a fiend incarnate now\nprofess to regard him as an angel of\nlight and fit for immediate apotheosis.\nIf we are to teat this aggregation, we\nmust pot up a ticket that will command\nand receive tbe support of a united de\nmocracy. With a united party we feel\nassured of success, with a dissatisfied\nparty success will be doubtful. The\ncounty democratic ticket should be com\nposed of thoroughly representative men\nand our nominees should command the\nsupport of a united party. We cannot\nafford to jeopardize success by nominat\ning unpopular men. No matter what a\nman’s claim may be upon the party if he\nbe not strong and popular, he should be\nwilling to step aside and give room to\nsomeone more acceptable to the people\nand to wait for a more appropriate time\nfor the recognition of his services. Such\nis our conception of democratic duty.\nWe can win if we will, and we must win.\nLet us make no mistakes.\nSTATE DEMOCRATIC 00CTSVTX0V.\nThe Democrats of Maryland assembl ed\nin State Convention at Ford’s Opera\nHouse, Baltimore, Thursday last and\nnominated Dr. Joshua W.

It is as follows :\n“Called together for the purpose of\nnominating our State ticket and declar\ning the principles and policy which\nshould be observed in the administration\nof our State affairs, we, the repreanta\ntives of tbe Democracy of Maryland, do\nnot feel It to be necessary at this time to\ndo more in regard to national issues\nthan to reaffirm our steadfast allegiance\nto the cardinal doctrines of the Demo\ncratic party as expounded by its illus\ntrious founder, Thomas Jefferson, and\nour undiminisbed belief that adherence\nto these doctrines will beet preserve in\nits original integrity and strength the\nconstitutional government established\nby the fathers of tbe Republic.\n“We confidently ask the aupp rt of\nthe people at the election in November\nnext for the State and local casdidsio\nof our party, because we believe tb 4\ntheir success is necessary to secure to tbe\nState a continuance of the good govern\nment which our citizens now enjoy un\nder Democratic control.\n“After four years’ experience of Re\npublican rule tbe people cast it off. and\nsince the beginning of the year 1990 all\nbranches of our Bute government have\nbeen administered by Democratic offi\ncials.

They have\nguarded with care the Bute\'s invest\nments and have so prudently and eco\nnomically managed tbe public institu\ntions owned by tbe State as to make\nthem equal to tbe very best in the Union.\n“Governor John Walter Smith has\nstrictly and impartially enforced the\nla is The turbulence and dtyrder\nwbicb Republican success encouraged\nand engendered in a class of our inbab\nHants have been largely repressed, so\nthat safety to person and property is now\nassured.\n“Tbe record of the Democratic party\ndemonstrates that while it has always\nfavored and promoted the development\nof tbe material interests of the Bute and\nthe people by proper encouragement of\ncorporate enterprise, it has at the same\ntime kept itself free from obligations to\ncorporate wealth and power, steadily\nacting upon the sound Democratic doc\ntrine of equal advantages to all. special\nprivileges to none; and we feel that it\nmay safely be trusted without explicit\npledge to adhere to this wise, just and\nconservative policy.\n“Confessedly difficult as ig legislation\naffecting tbe development and protec\ntion of the oyster and other kindred\nprodncU of the Chesapeake bay and its\ntributaries, we are especially gratified to\nbe able to declare that the act passed at\ntbe session of 1900 relating to these im\nportant interests baa thus far met the\nexpectations of iu framers.\n“While it has not provided revenues\nsufficient to put back into tbe trea*u> v\nthe deficiency of $35,000 left us by th-\nRepublicans, it has nevertheless mad.\nour Bute fishery fo- • more self-sup\nporting, and will und übtedly give ns *\nhandsome surplus at (he end of the fi •\ncal year.\n“Moreover, undei its provisions, en\ncouraging progress L* been made in tbe\ndevelopment and preservation of our\noyster beds, which constitute so vast a\nsource of Bute wealth, and full protec\ntion is given to tbe large numbers of\nworthy and sturdy men who are engaged\nin tbe prosecution of this great and val\nuable industry.\n“Objections to some of its details\nwhich experience has developed, as well\nas some defects, which have been no\nticed, can be remedied, and we favor\nsuch appropriate amendments as will re\nmove all reasonable ground of complaint\nand make tbe law thoroughly effective\nand satisfactory.\n“Tbe Democratic party of Maryland,\nalways the advocate and supporter of a\nbroad and liberal public school system,\nreaffirms iu belief that tbe problem of\npopular education is among tbe most\nimportant with which the State must\ndeal.\n“Tbe progress, comfort and happiness\nof tbe Commonwealth are advanced by\nthe education of the masses. A free\npeople must be developed and educated\nby fiee schools.\n“We have good reason to be proud of\nour admirable school system, but as the\nState advances and education becomes\nmore general tbe methods of adminis\ntering our public schools must be im\nproved to keep pace with tbe public de\nmand, and to remove well-founded com\nplaint and dissatisfaction.\n“Above all things they should be con\nducted without reference to politics, and\nshould be absolutely free from partisan\ninterference or dictation.\n“Teachers should be appointed and re-\nUined for their fitness only, and should\nbe safe from removal except for cause,\nafter reasonable opportunity to be heard\nin their own defense.\n“We accordingly recommend tbe pas\nsage by tbe next Legislature of an set\nproviding for the appointment bv the\nGovernor of a commission of prominent\ncitizens, selected irrespective of their\npolitical views, from among those who\nare personally interested in tbe improve\nment and efficiency of our public schools,\nwhose dutv it shall be to examine into\ntheir condition and management, and to\nreport what amendments of our existing\nlaws are necessary to reform whatever\nshall be found defective in their admin\nistration, and in tbe method of appoint\nment and tenure of the commissioners.\n“We heartily commend the wisdom\nand courage of Oov. John Walter Smith\nin calling tbe recent extra session of the\nLegislature and we feel that our thanks\nare due to our Democratic Senator* and\nDelegates for tbe admirable and conser\nvative legislation enacted at that session\nin the face of many and serious difficul\nties.\n“The painful and disgraceful disclos\nures made in tbe recent trials in tbe Cir\ncuit Court of the United States in Balti\nmore city of tbe parties charged with\nfalsifying tbe Federal Census In some\nof the counties of tbe State amply dem\nonstrate tbe wisdom and necessity of\noar late State census.\nWhatever doubts may have once ex\nisted upon this subject have been thor\noughly dispelled, and the result attain\ned, viz ,an absolutely fair and proper\nrepresentation of the counties in the\nHouse of Delegates is well worth tbe\nmoney which it cost.\n“In taking tbe important step of call\ning the extra session ike Governor was\nsimply exercising tbe express power\nconferred and performing tbe special\nduty imposed upon him by tbe Constitu\ntion. Had he omitted the performance\nof his doty the result* of the flagrant\nfraud* in the Federal census which\njudicial investigation has so fully ex\nposed would have been fastened upon\nus for 10 years without possibility of\nredress.\n“Indeed, the alternative presented to\nthe Governor of accepting as true a false\nand fraudulent enumeration of our pop\nulation, deliberately made to serve dis\nhonest political purposes, or of putting\nthe State to tbe expense of an extra\nsession of the Legislature to frustrate so\ndisreputable a conspiracy, was one as to\nwhich there was no room for serious\nhesitation, and we confidently appeal to\nthe people to indorse bis action in this\nimportant matter and to approve by\ntheir votes the prompt response of the\nLegislature to bis call.\n“The experience of ten years having\ndemonstrated that bhanges in our Aus\ntralian ballot system were necessary to\nput an end to the intimidation, bribery\nand fraud for which, as enacted in Mary\nland, it has been found to afford such\nample facilities, and, the demands for\nthese reforms being great and orgeat,\nthe Governor felt it to oe bis imperative\ndoty to give to the people an opportuni\nty for relief, and, although tbe calling\nof an extra session necessarily involved\na considerable expenditure of money,\nyet the cost was not to be weighed\nagainst the benefits of a free, honest and\nenlightened suffrage.\n“We stand by the emphatic utterances\nof the State Central Committee on this\ns ibject at iu meeting in Annapolis on\nthe Idtn day of March last and approve\nof tbe amendmenU to our Election law\nmade at the extra session, believing that\nthey are free from valid constitutional\nobjections, in all reapecU impartial, fair\nand just; that they will do much to\npurify and elevate the suffrage and\nmake tbe votes east what for many\nyears they bate not been—the real ex\npression of the a 111 of each and every\nvoter.\n“We believe that our elections should\nbe controlled by the votes of our own\npeople exclusively and that persona who\npermanently reside out\'ide the limits\nof the State should not be permitted to\nregister and vote. We therefore d- I\ndare our hearty approval of the amend- j\nmeat passed at the special session cover\ning this important subject.\n“Indeed, the startling revelation made\nby our recent State census that our reg\nistration books contain many thousands\nof names of voters who\' could not be\nfound is of itgeif a complete vindication\nof tbe necessity of this amendment and\nan effectual answer to those who are\nnow asking for its repeal.\n“We favor tbe passage of a general\nlaw relating to primary elections and\napplicable to tbe whole State, so drawn\nas to reform abuses wherever compris\ned of and to ncure to sll political par\nties tbe selection of candidates chosen\nby methods beyond objection or re\nproach.\n“We pledge our party to tbe oontinn\nance of an economical administration of\nour State finances end to such legisla\ntion as will keep down to tbe lowest\nproper limit tbe burdens of taxation.\n“The Democratic party represents\nmore than 40,000 majority of the white\npeople of Maryland They In common\nwith their brelbern of other States into\nwhich large masses of colored voters\nhave been injected into the body politic\nrecognize that tbe peace, good ordyr,\npersonal safety sad proper development\nof our material interests depend upon\ntbs control of tbe Commonwealth by its\nintelligent white residents. Without the\naid of tbe 60,000 colored voters tbe Re\npublican party in Maryland would be a\nhopeless minority.\n“We therefore without hesitation pro\nclaim that tbe success of tbe Democratic\nparty will mean that while we shall\ndeal with perfect fairness in securing\nall tbe benefits of good government and\nfall and free opportunities for education\nto all classes, such action must be taken\nas to prevent tbe control of tbe State\ngovernment from passing into tbe hand*\nof those who have neither tbe ability\nnor tbe interest to manage public affairs\nwisely and well.\n“To secure this most desirable result\nwe earnestly call on all Democrats to\nlay aside all tbeir differences and to\nnnite in an enthusiastic and patriotic\neffort to maintain our Democratic sup\nremacy in Maryland."\nCol. J. E. Kilgour, of Montgomery\ncounty, paid the following tribute to tbe\nlate J. Frank Ford, of this county :\n“Before approaching tbe subject mat\nter in the bands of tbe convention you\nwill pardon a moment’s digression.\nMany moons have waxed ana waned\nsince it was my pleasure, as it was my\nhonor, to stand upon tbit floor and in\nthis very stale, in tbe advocacy of that\nsplendid specimen of manhood, that ac\ncomplished gentleman, that bold and j\nfearless champion of Democracy, tbe la- 1\nmented Frank Ford, for tbe nomination\nof Clerk of the Court of Appeals.

Indeed, I think it very delightful\nto sec the respective teams make a good\nbit and laud the ball far out at some safe\nplace and make a determined rush for\nthe bases.

Ah ! but the voice of the umpire\nrings out, "Play ball!” and at last the\nuproar is stopped. Yes, it is very pleas\nant to see and very beneficial to the\nplayers as good exercising. A compe\ntent team in this vicinity would create\na sensation, but I expect the boys are\ntoo bashful, for the girls would wish to\nsee the playing. Well, boys, don’t be\nbashful, the girls will help you to victo\nry by admiring your ralor.\nCity visitors are now enjoying the\nhealthful breezes of old St. Mary’s.

Rex.\nMaryland tammsr School.\nThe Maryland Bummer School for\nteachers, at the Maryland Agricultural\nCollege, College Park, Md., closed its\nsession on July 81. The curriculum\nembraced Botany, Drawing, Entomo\nlogy, Chemistry, Physical Culture, Ana\ntomy, Soil Pbyaica, Horticulture, Eng\nlish Literature and Mathematics. Nine\nteen students took all or a part of the\nconrse and the success of the school as\na permanent institution is probably as\nsured. The excursions throughout the\nsurrounding country made in connection\nwith nature studies were greatly enjoy\ned by the class. The social pert of the\nschool is said to have been a great sac\ncess; a large number of excursions, re\nceptions and dances having been enjoy\ned by the students and faculty. It is\nunderstood that the College is making\npreparations for a large attendance\nnext sdmmer.\nWhat most people want is something\nmild and gentle, when in need of a phys\nic.

Md., who write* under dele\nof January 99, 1901. end make* various\nsuggestion* for improving the law* reg\nulating the catching of baa* and other\nfiah in the waters of his county, waa\nhanded me this morning.\nThe suggestions which Mr. Bolt throws\nout are quite in line with the laws now\nin force on the Potomac river and which\nwe hope to have made uniform through\nout the State when the next legislature\nmeets, and I hope that Mr. Bolt will use\nbis best endeavors to impress upon the\nmembers from bis county the import\nance of these laws and the neccaaity of\ntheir passage if they desire to see the\nMonocacy and other Frederick county\nstreams filled with fish for the benefit\nand amusement of their constituents\nwithout prejudice or favor to any one\nclass of citixens, but that there may be\nenough fish in the rivers to satisfy the\nappetites of all regardless of condition\nin life.\nNow is the time, in my opinion, when\neverybody throughout the State, who has\nat heart the true interests of fish and\nfiahermen. whether fishing for profit or\npleasure, as well as the Interests of those\nwho purchase the fish for the sustenance\nof themselves and their families, to be\nstir themselves in the matter of *0 mod\nifying and changing the existing laws\nand the manner of enforcing same, that\nthey may be made uniform throughout\nthe various counties, to the benefit of all\nequally and not as now, only for the\nbenefit of a small favored class who\nmostly live at the months of our numer\nous rivers and who with their large\npounds, stake and purse-nets and other\ncontrivances for the wholesale destruc\ntion and catching of fish prevent the fish\nfrom going to the upper waters of the\nstreams and thus destroy the opportu\nnities of those who live in the back\ncountry from the pleasure and profit of\ncatching their supplies close to their\nown homes and farms.\nA large portion of the laws as they\nnow exist unquestionably favor only a\ncertain small class of fishermen, who\nalso seem to have sufficient political in\nfluence to prevent the enforcement of\nthe few good laws now on the statute\nbooks, which were evidently intended to\nprevent this wholesale destruction of\nfish for the benefit of of the few, but to\nthe detriment of the majority of the cit\nizens of our State.\nVery respectfully,\nHesrv Buai nk.\n- m\n| COM Ml-HtCATRD.\nQaihsvii.i.b, Texas, July Ml, ’Ol,\nMessrs.

New Vork. m\n: y yr cc .-d SI.OO, all\n! 1 Washington, D. 1901.\nThe Haona-Piatt combine against\nis he newest thing in the polities]\nfield. It was intended to he strict\nly a secret affair, but somebody\n. leaked. The story, • told in\ns Washington, says that several traal\n• ed i tea tenants of Senators Hanna\nand Platt, met in a hotel, not a\nthousand miles from Washington,\nand entered into • deal, pledging\ni theit respective principals to vork\ntogether in taking whatever steps\nthat might be made aaeeeaary by\nTeddy’s Western trip lo head off\nany boom that might he started\nfor hie nomination for President-\nPlatt’s men tried to gel Hanna’s\nmen to commit their chief to the\nsupport of Gov. Odell as Mr. Mc-\nKinley’s successor, bat that was\nfarther than the Uannaitea were\nwilling to go. They agreed that\nno other New York man would be\npat forward by Hanna at a candi\ndate for the Preaideniial nomina\ntion, and that if KooomU could\nnot be kept out of the nomination\nin any other way than by nominat\ning Odell, Hanna would throw bis\ninfluence to him. Meanwhile,\nPlatt’s men are to boom Odell and\ninsist that he will have the solid\nsupport of the New York delega\ntion to the National Convention\nand that the name of no other New\nYork candidate will be presented.\nThe game is not to openly fight\nTeddy bat simply to ignore bis\ncandidacy and nndermine whatever\nstrength he may develop elsewhere,\nby making it apparent that he is\nnot seriously considered as a candi\ndate in his own state. At tbe\nPlatt end of tbe deal they regard it\nas advantageous to Odell, bat the\nHanna men do not take that view\nof it. Tbey think that they have\nmade a deal that will give them the\nhelp of tbe Platt machine to kill\nTeddy at home, bat do not believe\nthat Odell will show enough strength\noutside of New York, to give them\nany trouble when they get ready to\nspring tbe name of Hanna’s condi\ndate. They are all a little bit\nafraid of tbe hurrah with tbe\nyounger republicans associate with\nTeddy’s name.\nCaptain Parker, one of Admiral\nSchley’s counsel, who spent nearly\nall of last week searching tbe re\ncords of tbe Navy Department, and\nwho will resume tbe vork this\nweek, filed a formal protest with\nActing Secrstary Haskett against\nthe espionage he wss subjected to\nwhile doing the work. Mr. Hack\nett’s explanation was that tbs\nNaval regulations requiredso offi\ncer to be present, when a person\nnot connected with tbe service was\nallowed to examine the official re\ncords of tbe department, bat Capt.\nParker did not think that the Na\nval regulations required sn officer\nto be on each side of him, making\nnote of everything be copied from\nthe records, as was actually tbe\ncase. The troth of the matter is\nthat tbe clique which has been\nhounding Admiral Schley ever since\nthe beginning of tbe war with Spain\nare thoroughly frightened—tbey\nknow that tbe country will not\nstand for aocb methods as tbey\nhave been guilty of in their efforts\nto disgrace Admiral Schley, and\nfear the exposure that will be\nbrought about by the evidence be\nfore tbe Coart of Inquiry, onless\nstubborn facts can be joggled out\nof that evidence. Gapt. Parker\nhas discovered several important\nfacts in tbe official records, which\nsupport Admiral Schley\'s inten\ntions concerning his movements,\nwhile in command of tbe Flying\nSquadron which was searching for\ntbe Spanish fleet, and he expects to\nfind more.\nIf Mr. John R.

Think\nof such admissions aa tbe following,\n: in an interview intended to ebov\ntbe great and glorious things ws\nhave accomplished for Porto Rico ;\n“The American system of govern\nment is proving more costly than\nthat of tbe Spaniards.” “Thus\nfar the influx of America* money\nhas not been so rapid or prolific aa\nwas generally expected.”\nComptroller Trace well, of the\nTreasury, whose o. k , is required\nbefore any doubtful requisition on\ntbe Treasury can be paid, evident\nly doe* not stand in fear of the\n! party boeaes, as hs has just render\ned a decision which breaks sp s\nlittle scheme of Director Merrism,\nof tbe Censos Bureau, to pat #2,-\n1 500 a year in the pocket of a favor\nite, who already draw* that amount\nthrough a sinecure position in tbe\nGeological Survey. Comptroller\n, Tracevell ha* decided that tbe Act\nof Congress prohibiting tbe draw\ning of two Government salaries by\n, one person, meant exactly what it\nI says. Something like a year and a\nhalf ago, Henry Gannett, who is on\nthe payroll of tbe Geological Sur\nvey, for #2,500 a year, waa appoint\ned Geographer of tbe Census, of a\nI salary of #2,500 a year, hot he has\nI not been allowed to draw the latter\nsalary. Commissioner Merrism\nwrote to the Comptroller to know\nwhy and received an exhaustive\nopinion, tbe subject of which was\nthat Mr. Gannett had not boon al\nlowed to draw salary as a Census\nofficial, because hia appointment\nI* waa illegal.

Bro\nnaugh set bis shoulder to the wheel\nwith the determination that knew\nno defeat, with a vigor unabated\nby twenty-five years of unsuccess,\nuntil finally the sentiment in Min\nnesota was completely reversed,\nand on noon of Sunday, July 14,\nthe stalwart Henry County Missou\nrian walked forth from Stillwater\nPenitentiary with Cole Younger on\nhis right arm and Jim on his left.\nCase a Factor\nin Minnesota Politics.\nNo case in the criminology of\nthe world has attracted, perhaps,\nso much attention as that of the\nYoungers.

Be\nfore the Pardon Board took favor\nable action the release of the pris\noners was recommended by two\nsuccessive legislatures.\nGovernor Marshall of Minnesota,\na former Missourian, ardently es\npoused the cause of the Youngers,\nand after bis term in office took an\nactive and intense interest in the\nefforts to secure their liberty.\nWarden Wolfer, won to the cause\nof the prisoners by their own mien\nand demeanor, became one of their\nstanchest supporters.

Miss Lillian\nLewis, well-known as an actress,\nwas the center of his affection, and\nbad made many visits to jail to the\nprisoner to see him, and had his\nrelease come sooner than a year\nago, when Miss Lewis died, it is as\nserted by his warmest friends that\na few days after the parole would\nhave heard the wedding bells.\nThe Pardon Board for the State\nof Minnesota, which finally con\nsented to a parole, consists of Gov.\nV. M. Clough, Chief Justice Cbas.\nM. Start, Attorney General U.
