There, waa among the crew of the Alabama,, which waa made Up of the most des, perate tueu of all nations, one named, DiSoo. lie la aaid to have been a mild, mannered man. slender and delicate, looking. but aa bloodthirsty f s a tiger., He was called Crocodile i>ixon. the, aartiaine beta* abbreviated to Crocky., In liitiS tbe Alabama visited the Indian, arrhipe;ufo IHson deserted and set, up in the buaioesw oi piracy on bia own, account., Ue succeeded in getting a small, ?rhooner. w ha h be named the Semmea, in honor, or, rather, dishonor, of bia, , old commander. armed her, gathered a, crew a?i\' b aa could easily be picked, up in that region of pirates and pro, ceeded in ii hi - If master of ev, erjtbiui that floated except men-of, war. frtm which he scudded away aa, teat a a sjils would carry bltu.

Be, sides ber crew were a number of pas, sengers. in ludlue women and chil, dren Captain Archer, a young man, who bad Uvo promoted from mate,, was ber commander. Lie had recently, been married, and his wife was, aboard, Now. tbe captain had been in these, waters before and knew its dangers., As soon as be espied the low cat, ac hooter lying at anchor so quietly be, sas]ie?-ted ber This is why be risked, fxftiog his ship aground on tbe rocks, before nightfall in order to make tbe, open an. He had a pilot, but the air, was murky, and be was afraid of fog., if tbe schooner were really a pirate, be might better sink his abip than fall, a prey to ber On tbe other hand, if, a foe came on It might conceal tbe, ahip from tbe pirate., While be was debating tbe chances, a mist settled down which soon con, cealed tbe two vessels from each Oth, er Dtxoo before tbe Mary Blake was, bidden bad noted her position so that, be would be able to steer for her In, esse tbe fog protected ber for too long, a time to accord with bis Interests., Captain Ar her. who had anchored, seeing tbe necessity of changing bis, position, raised tbe anchor and pertnit, \' ?"? ? ijms^*?. *?, ted th? tide to carry htm half a mile, dowu. wheu. not daring to risk utrik, tut: something by going farther, be an, chored ag-tlo., When darkuess fell the Semrnes was, still iu b?-r original position, while the, Mm ry Blake was half s tulle away, fiviu where Crocky Dixon supposed, ?be was. Durlug the uight Captalu, Archer thought It expedient to lufortn, both bis crew and bis passengers of j, the danger. if the scboouer he bad, seen was a pirate, as soon as the fog, lifted he would eome for them. And, if it did uot soon lift he might not wait, for It to uo so. The captain therefore i, directed that not a light should appear, on the ship and there should be no, noise aboard to indicate to the pirates j, that the two vessels were near each, ; other., Not a person aboard the Mary Blake 1, slept that night except the children, who were too young to understand the j, terrible danger that threatened them. |, ! The captalu told them that there was, little danger of belug attacked at j, night and that they bad better get, i what rest they could, since they might ,, need all their fortitude in the mornlug., No change In the weather came with, the dawn. The fog remained, and |, there was uo wind. Dixon ordered j, out a boat\'s crew to pull the Sernmes, toward where be had last seen the |, Mary Blake. But the ship was not i, where he had last seen her. Knowing j, I that since she could not hare moved j, up she must have moved down, he dl- j, rected the oarsmen to pull down- i, 1 stream., It was about 4 o\'clock In the I, moruing that officers, crew and passen- j, gers of the Mary Blake? the juissen- \', gers herded together In groups ou deck, ?caught the sound of oars working in i, rowlocks. Every cheek blanched. The j, women gathered their children in their j, arms as If to shield them. But no one 1, uttered even a moan lest the sound, should betray tbem. Captain Archer ., leaued over the bulwarks, listening In, tently. What arms there were aboard !, had been brought up and placed on !, deck, with the Intention that If board- j, ed the men would sell their lives as, dearly as possible, but as to making a, successful defense. It was not consld- ^, end. As the sound grew more dis, tinct. indicating that the boat was ap >, preaching, the captalu turned and, fac, lug the terror stricken people on deck,, put his finger on his lips to enjoin !, I, All could hear the sound of oars, working slowly, indicating to the ex, perienced ears of Captain Archer that, a boat was towing souie craft larger, thau Itself. Then there was a sound j, i of an oar slipping from a rowlock., ! Some greenhorn had "caught a crab.", The nest iustant there came over the, water frightful oaths and the crack of j, a pistol. Crocky had first sworn at j, and then shot the man who had slip, lied his oar., This was quite enough to indicate to, those on the Mary Blake the awful j, fate in store for them in case they ;, were found by the pirate. The men j, drew long breaths. The women put, wraps about the children\'s heads, fear- |, ing that they might cry. Not a sound, escaped, and in a few minutes it was !, eTident that the pirates had missed, (hem., But it was not to be expected that, the search was ended. Crocky would, i continue it as long as the fog lasted, i, and when it lifted they would be at, i his mercy. Many were the prayers J, whispered that Providence might In- :, terpose between them and the horrors ;, awaiting them. All now hoped that the |, fog would continue, that the expected j, massacre or walking of the plank, j, whichever it might be, should be de- i, ferred as long as possible. Then, too,, the longer the fog lasted the more hope, that somethlug might occur to change, \' the situation., There were no further indications of J, ! the presence of the pirate for an hour, j, j The fog was getting thinner, and it ?, was plain that it might at any mo- ;, i incut be possible to distinguish through, It objects at a fair distance. Then \', ame another terror for those aboard, the Mary Blake. The sound of oars, was again heard, this time more, rapid. Indicating that they were not j, \' tow ing. Then through the dissipating, mist was seeu a boat pulled by six [, <>an>men. As soon as they espied the j, Mary Blake they set up a blood cur- j, dllng shout. Besting on their oars,, they began to look about them for the, Semmes, which they had evidently left j, In the prosecution of their search., And now with the suddenness of up- j, lifting fogs this one vanished, giving, ! place to bright sunshine. The rowboat, was a cable\'s length from the Mary, lilake, the Semmes was half a mile, ? beyond the rowboat, and two miles, above .i as a ship coming down with, the tide, which had just turned. A, light breeze filled her sails. But the, most gladdening sight of all was the, square openings along her sides for, guns, indicating that she was a man, of-war, and more cheering than all, was the stars and stripes streaming, from the peak., To the men in the boat the sight of, this new ship was as terrifying as It, was gratifying to those on the Mary, Slake. They pulled frantically to the, Semmes, whose crew, having seen the, sluht, were getting up sail. Having, taken aboard the boat\'s crew, they, slipped their cable and made off to the, southward at an angle with the course, <?f the man-of-war. By the time the, latter received the signals that the fly, ing schooner was a pirate It was too, late. She had got into waters where, :be armed vessel could not follow her., Then those on the Mary Blake fell, on their knees and gave thanks for, their escape., Crocky Dixon met his end while pur, sued by a United States gunboat., When it was evident that be would be, tak n he fired a shot Into hla own, ? brain., 1 . .r i* (*;???, SERIAL NO. 01399., NOTICE OP APPLICATION FOR U., S.
