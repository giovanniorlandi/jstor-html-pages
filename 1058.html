SHRUG HESS\n? * ?"\nThe following forceful nddress was delivered last Monday by Judge E.\nJ. L. Taber to our dcparting^soldier boys. The Judge was deeply moved by\nthe occasion and he spoke with great seriousness. He strongly impressed\nupon his hearers the necessity of* standing- behind our boy6 at the front and\ngiving their every support within our power. His scathing arraignment of\nthose who hold dollars dearer than lives will not soon be forgotten by those\nwho heard him:\nMr. Chairman anil Fellow Citizen*:\nA hundred and forty years ago our forefathers were shedding their blood\nIn the cause of liberty. It they had lost in the Revolutionary War, the result,\nthough serious, would most likely have been that we might still be a part of\n, the British Empire. But as time went on, we would have been given self\ngovernment, as it exists in our great neighbor. Canada. For, while we would\nI have suffered temporarily from the oppression of I.ord North and George HI.,\nj it would not have been long till the natural justice exemplified by such Bri- J\ntons as Pitt and Burke would have prevailed, and we should eventually have\nbecome a practically free people.\nAgain, had the North failed in the Civil war. slavery would have con j\nlinued for a time, and the success of Secession would have resulted in iherc\nbeing two Republics instead of one. But slavery would have died it natural I\n| death in the course of time, and we should slill have preserved the blessings |\nj of liberty.\nBut if, which God forbid, wo should lose the war which has now been\nforced upon us by a military autocracy whoso plain purpose is to dominate\nthe world, then the liberty of ull mankind will be lost for an indefinitely long\nl period of time, and those thing* for which our forefathers fought so valiantly,\nand which we yet cherish with undying devotion- our Constitutions, our\ndemocratic institutions, our right to participate in the affairs of government,\nwill all be swept away, for how long Clod alone knows.\nThis great conflict Is not merely a war of nation agaiust nation, or of |\npeople against people. It is a contest in which fundamental principles are\nat stake principles vital to all human kind. Our whole planet is aflame in\nthis titanic struggle, wherein the right is battling against the wrong, and\nthe angels of light are arrayed against the powers of darkness. A war of\nsuch dimensions the world never has, never could have known before, and the\nIssue of the conflict will determine the future of mankind.\nThese thirty-odd young men. whose chief connection with history up to\ntliis time lias probably been to road more or less about It in their school\nbooks, are now themselves about to actually engage in the making of the;\nihost Important of ail the history of this world. L\'p to n very short time ago\n| we were hopeful that none\' of the hoys would ever really have Is cross the \'\nAtlantic, because we felt that peace would probably come before our young |\nmen had completed their training. But the present situation in Russia and\nthe reverses on the Italian front compel us to feel that in all likelihood not :\nonly those who have been called but perhaps millions more will have to go!\nand actually participate in I lie struggle.\nLet me give you a sample of the uncertainties of this war. On October\n23 the oiflcial publication of the United States government. The Official Bulle\ntin. published by the Committee on l\'ublic Information, printed the secretary\nof war\'s "Weekly War Review" of the military operations of the war for the\nweek ending October 20. 101". This review was authorized by the secretary\nof war. Listen to this language quoted therefrom: "Rumors of an inipi sid\ning Austrian offensive directed against Italy have been current during the\npast week. Reports of concentration of Austrian and German divisions to\ntake part in tills attack are noted. Anyone familiar with the situation can\nat once determine that these rumors are exaggerated. Even should the\n| season permit it, the concentration of the number of fresli enemy divisions\nj estimated as high as forty could not, as a physical possibility, lake place in\nthe narrow Trent inn Valley fed by a single railway system." Even as these\nJ words were being written the great offensive was beginning, and by the time\nthe secretary of war\'s review had reached us here in Elko through the mail\n| the drive was practically completed, with tin- dire results too well known\nto us. This Is not said in criticism of the secretary of war. but is pointed\nout for the purpose of showing the uncertainties of the situation.\nI do not mean by those statements to create an atmosphere of pcasinii.-m\nor discouragement. My purpose is to be candid about the war situation in\norder that we may realize our duty t?> these young tuen. They arc not going\ni on a picnic, an excursion or a Joy-ride. They are starting on the first stage\nof a Journey which will Inter take theni from the training camp across the\nI United States, thence across the Atlantic through the enemy\'s U-boats, and\nfinally onto the soil of the Old World, there to fight against the same veterans\n! who overwhelmed Ih-lgium. Servla and Roumanln. and who have made such\ni inroads Into Russia, France and Italy. And this fighting they will do for you\nand me, who do not go, at least as yet, but who stay behind in our comfort\nable homes, enjoying the society of our families and most of tlie good things\nof life.\n? .\nDo we owe these young men anything? We owe them, my friends, all\nI thnt we can do for them. While they are being soldiers at the front, we\nshould lie soldiers nt home, backing them up in every way we possibly can.\nAnd how can we do this thing? Ily doing what the government asks us to do,\nand anything else that we can think of and are able to do. The government\nwants us to buy Liberty ilonds whenever they are offered. It wants its to\ncontribute to the Red Cross. It wants us to cooperate In the matter of food\nconservation, and it is our sacred duty to do so. There is also the Y. M. (\'. A\nMany of you must have rend the letter from Wellington Wetland published\na few evenings ago in one of the locnl papers, telling us how much the I\nY M. C. A. means to our boys In the training camps. Who after reading\nsuch a letter would hesitate to contribute according to his means to (lie Y\nM C. A ?\nThe time lias long since tome when in this country everybody must either\nbe for It or against It. If a man be not for our country, then he Is against It\nKlko county has been doing well up to this time In many things has I\nbeen doing very well. The majority of our people are awake to the serious\nness of the situation, and are helping where and when they tan help Hut\nthere are still a few who by their Indifference or because of their Inordinate\nlove of money are ranging themselves on the side of the Herman govern\nment. Only a few days ago I was told of a man residing in Klko county\nnot one of our wealthiest men, but a man of considerable means who would\nnot buy a Liberty Bond because he claimed that the exemption board had\nexempted n man who should not have been exempted. There seems to be a\nfew who will not support the lied Cross heeauso they suspicion It In a "graft."\nA few also I rem to think that the Y. M. A in composed of some over-pious\npeople who do no real good in helping the boys who go to the front. Then\nwe have a few people who will not cooperate with the government on food\ncnscrrntlon because they are nfrald their neighbors will not. "I\'ll Just bet\nyou that Mrs. So and 80 is not doing It, and if slio doesn\'t I don\'t see w hy I\nshould." Such arguments amount simply to t hi - because someone else is\nhelping the kaiser. I\'ll help him too How the kaiser r.,tist rub his hands and\n(Continued on Pag* Four)\n*\n0\nSTOCKMEN MEET i\nII GOLD CREEK\nImportant Business Transact\ned and New Officers are\nElected\nA meeting of the members of the\nNorth Fork Livestock Association was\nj held at Gold Creek on November .1.\nGold Creek.

(\ni\nCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN i\nJAPAN AND THE UNITED SMS i\n?\nI\nGerman Propaganou of Years To Disrupt Relations Between i\nTwo Nations Completely Undone; Clean Understanding Is 1\nReached as to Co-operation in War Against Germany ]\nWASHINGTON. Nov. 7.?Japan and gc\nthe United States hare reached a com- sj\nplete agreement in relation to China tc\nand at the same time have arrived at ot\na clear understanding as to military, m\nnaval and economic co-operation in C\nthe war against Germany.\nThis momentous development has S\nbeen announced by Secretary Lansing a\nwho made public notes exchanged by ?\nhim and ViBCOunt Ishli, the special (l\nJapanese ambassador formally record- 1\ning an agreement recognixing that Ja\npan has a special interest in China ?\nbut pledging the independence and n\nterritorial integrity of the great east\nern republic and reaffirming the doc 11\ntrine of the "open door" for commerce 11\nand industry. ^\n*1\nIn a statement accompanying the\nnote, Mr. Lansing said Viscount Ishil ^\nand the members of his mission, no.v\non their way home, had performed a 1\nservice of the highest value to the p\nUnited States as well as to Japan, by 1\nclearing away misunderstandings\nwhich if unchecked, promised to de- c\nvelop a serious situation in the far c\neast. He spoke of an attitude of con\nstraint and doubt fostered by a cam- \'\npaign of falsehood adroitly and secret- (\n1** carried on by the Germans and said 1\nthat through the frankness and cordi\nality of the Japanese commissioners,\nthe propaganda of years had been un\ndone in a few days.\nUntil last night when an Associated .\nPress cable despatch from Peking an\nnounced that the Japanese ambassa- \'\ndor there had informed the Chinese\nforeign office of the signing of an\nagreement by Secretary Lansing and\nViscount Ishil, it had not been known\ngenerally that the delicate far eastern\nquestern had been taken up at the\nconferences between the commission\ners and American officials.

RESIDENCE 1M1\nGRAMMAR SCHOOL NOTES\nThe seventh and eighth grades of\nthe Elko Grammar School gave a\nvery attractive HoUovre\'en party last\nFriday evening In the form or a mas\nquerade. Some of the boys and girls\ncame in coetumes suggestive of the\nholiday celebrated while others were\ncostumed after anything the mind\nmight fancy. Nearly all characters\nwere so well sustained that the iden\ntity w is concealed until time for un\nmasking. The merry frolic continued\nfrom the time the grand march was\nled by Prof. Welday and Miss Hansel\nuntil all adjourned to the gymnasium\nfor the dainty refreshments that were\nprepared by the pupils. The gym was\ntastefully decorated with Hallowe\'en\nornaments and looked weired and\nspooky Indeed, Draca Dubois, Laura\nHunt, Dorothy Halgh, Jessie Stinson\nand Kathleen Stewart of the sixth\ngrade assisted in serving. One of the\nmost pleasing features of the evening\nwas the presence of so many parents\nnnd friends. A number of prices were\nawarded for the best sustained char\nacters. Group price?Angelica Car\nvalho and Rose Thorne (Soldier and\nNurse). Girl\'s first price?Emma Mur\nphy (Scotch girl). Girl\'s second prize\n?Dee Jones (Colonial Lady). Boy\'s\nfirst price?Niles Bruce (Farmer).\nBoy\'s second price?Arthur Jukes\n(Girl). After a most delightful even\ning all departed voting the party the\nmost enjoyablg one ever given.\nThe nroKPnt onmllmoni i? 971 At\nthe beginning of last month it was\n256, showing that 15 pupils entered the\nsecond month of school. It" is neces\nsary, sometimes, to demote , pupils\nwho enter late because they have\nmissed so much work that they can\nnoto keep up with the class to which\nthey were provoted. A great deal of\nextra work is necessary on the part\nof the teachers to help pupils make up\nback work. Hence the importance of\nhaving thern enter at the beginning of\nthe year and remain in school until\nit closes.\nThere are now 151 of our pupils\nenrolled in the Junior Auxiliary of the\nAmerican Red Cross here. The per\ncent of the pupils in the various\ngrades are given below: Primary, 40\nper cent, first grade 44 per cent, sec\nond grade 70 per cent, third grade\n47 per cent, fourth grade 55 per cent,\nflifth grade 70 per cent, sixth grade,\n47 per cent, seventh grade 49 per\ncent, eighth grade 25 per cent. From\nthe membership fees alone we have\ndeposited in a local bank the sum of\n$37.75 already. This is quite a mate\nria! aid to this good cause. In the\nsewing classes the girls are going Red\nCross work and it proves very inter\nesting.\nRobert Flagler who has been visit\ning in Lewisvllle, Idaho, since last\nspring has returned and is in school\nagain. Datiste Toniera, William and\nDino Aiazxi entered the third grade\nMonday.\nThe number of cases of tardiness\nwas slightly reduced the past month,\nbut we most earnestly ask the parents\nto insist that their children come to\nschool on time.\nSome parents and guardinns do not\nseem to realize how very important it\nis to have pupils altend regularly.\n? m ? ?\nPOST YOUR XW1AS\nPARCELS EARLY\nWASHINGTON, Nov. 8?The post\noffice department urges early shopping\nand mailing for Christmas.\nChristmas parcels to be delivered\nin the United States should be mailed\nnot later than Devember 22. An ef\nfort should be made to get such par\ncels in the malls by the middle of\nDecember or earlier. When practic\nable, parcels mny be endorsed "Not\nto he opened before Christmas."\n1\'arcels for the men in the armies\nabroad muni be mailed not later than\nNovember 15 to insure delivery on\nChristmas morning. The department\nasks that the parcels do not exceed\nseven pounds.\nWhile Christmas mall for domestic\ndelivery will be hnndled by the post\noffices up to the last minute, the pub\nlic should make allowance for the\nstrnln upon transportation facilities\non account of war activities and the\nenormous Increase In the volume of\nordinnry mall. Added to this probnbly\nwill be the largest Christmas mall\never handled.\n? ^ ?i\nGENERAUS CONTRIBUTIONS\nTO THE RED CROSS CHAPTER\nContributions are still coming in for\nthe Red Cross In good shape though\nwe are not over burdened with too\nmuch cash.

Often have 1 wondered whether, if by any chance we should lose\nills war. there be anything whatever from which we could derive any comfort \'a\nr satisfaction. So far there is only one thing of this kind that occurs to me. i\nnd that is. if I could be a spectator when some big husky German tax collec\njr was squeezing# some indemnity out of one of these few sordid misers ,,e\nmt probably every community is infested with. Mr. Sordid Miser would, in ,\nis whining and lick-spittle manner, speak thus to Mr. German Indemnity ; ,n\nollector: "Dear Mr. German Tax Collector, you mustn\'t be too hard on me; |\ndidn\'t do anything against Germany; I didn\'t buy even a fifty-dollar Liberty\nlond; 1 didn\'t give a nickel to the Red Cross; I ate all the beef, wheat-Hour _\nread, sugar and fats that I could swallow." etc., etc. Then the big German\n?x gatherer would answer oi.iething like this: "You contemptible dog, it ca\nrnsn\'t because you wanted to help us that you didn\'t support your govern-1 C;\ntent; you would far rather your country had won this war than we; what 1 nl\nou wanted was to save your filthy dollars, and you hung onto them like ~\nleech. all the time that your neighbors\' sons were bleeding and dying for\nou and yours. Along side of you a yellow dog would look white as the \' a\nriven snow, and the last red penny you have to your name will be taken\no help pay the greatest war indemnity the world ever dreamed of. Come "\ncross?you poor fish!" If at that time there were a single smile left in me,\nbelieve that such a scene would warrant the use of it. >\nIf >. ou and I can afford to do and give something, but in fact do or give\nlolhing, how can we bear to meet face to face th" fathers and mothers and\nthers whose sons and dear ones have gone to fight for us?\n?There are those so poor that they really cannot afford to give anything. ^\n"ome there are who from early morn till late into the night struggle in order\nhat they may honorably provide the bare necessaries of life for their fam- -\nlies. No one should hold it against them if they do not give, because there are\n,oo many others who can afford to give. But there are some who pretend\n:bey cannot afford to help when the truth is ^that with a little self-denial\nhey could do at least a little?and every little helps. If we puff our big fat -\ntigars and pour the highballs and cocktails down our gullets, and refuse to ,i\n?ut even a half-spoonful less sugar in our coffee, can we stand up and say I a\n.hat we cannot afford to give even fifty cents a month !o the- Red Cross?\nAs to the rich, It is a splendid thing to know that many of them, if not\nliost of them, are doing a great deal, and no doubt many of them are doing j\nso from purely patriotic motives. Some of the wealthiest in our comnninitj\nire and from the beginning have been giving of their money, their time and\n.heir services in a manner that would do credit to any community. Rut\nhere seems to be a few that will not do anything unless they see that tin ir |\nDocket books will benefit by it. Such people had best sit down and do some\nvery serious thinking. Ret them ponder a moment as to who will pay the \'\nindemnity if the war should result adversely? if an indemnit> is to be ,\ncollected, and I have nothing and you have much, it requires no profound \'\nreasoning to see that you are going to do the paying, it is better to pay |\na littie now than to lose all later. Dear in mind Chicago\'s slogan in the re\ncent Ribcrty Rond drive: "What good is money anyhow if we don\'t win the I\nwar?" j\nRoys, Elko county is going to stand behind you, because we know what I\nyou are going to do for us. There are plenty of good people in this county\nto make up for the few dollar-slackers who think more of their money than )\nthey do of you who are going to offer your lives for them. We feel that\nthrough your efforts the same Hag that Is flying over this court house and\nover the schools and houses of Elko county will still be flying when you\ncome back to us. And in that day our hats will go off to you 9s they do to-11\nday, and when you speak we shall be silent. Honor will be yours, and it will\nl>e reflected upon those who have the right to claim you as their own: it\nwill go down to your children and grandchildren. In that great day Hie\npenny-souled tightwads who put a higher value on the rate of interest they\ncould make with their money than tljey put upon your lives, will he looking\nfor a place to hide their infamous heads.\nSome of us men of the world do not pray as much as we ought; but we i\nwill pray with your dear ones for your welfare, because you. who are beloved \\\nof them, will fight and bleed for those who are dear to us who remain behind. 1\nRut we\'ll do more thnn pray; we\'ll be doing while we pray.\nThis then is my appeal lo the people of Elko eounty: At tin same time\nthat we honor these young men. let us also help Hieui. Ret us always have\nin mind that while they are doing their duly for us. we have our duty to do\nby them, and that duly consists not only in encouraging them, but in denying\nourselves in order that in the hour of their trial they may he properly\nclothed and fed, promptly and properly nursed and cared for, and the neces\nsnvy military equipment placed in their hands and in the hands of our allies\nto enable tlient to preserve for us the liberty which is dearer than life.\nBoys, we know you will do all you can to mnke\'sure that the Stars and!\nStripes will not be hauled down in America, to be replaced by the hated\nline of the Herman Empire. We don\'t really appreciate what our flag means\nto us until we no longer have the right to raise It. Ask the people now living\nin Belgium under German domination. They exemplify the agony of heart\nand soul of a people who. having a flag, are not allowed to fling It to the\nbreeze.\nAs you go. boy it, we say, may Heaven have you in its care and keeping;\nand may you so fight for your country that its glorious flag shall still In\ntriumph wnve, o\'er iliis land of.thc free, this home of the brave.\nNOTICE\n-a?;??*\nTito citj now lias a supply of dog\nAnd %\'t1. i . .. .
