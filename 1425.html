        <pre>['Manipulation as an ideological tool in the \npolitical genre of Parliamentary discourses\nAna Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\nUniversity of Valencia\nThe present study analyzes the discursive strategies of manipulation in the political\ngenre of a discourse in Parliament with an aim to convince the audience that \nthe Prime Minister and his party are innocent of receiving illegal cash donations \nfrom a slush fund run in the party. For that purpose, we have used Van Dijk’s \n(2006) scheme of strategies of manipulation at several levels of discourse (content,\nlexis, topics, syntax, rhetoric, and order of discourse). Findings of the study \nshow that the Prime Minister’s speech presents characteristics of ideological discourse,\nsince it follows a general strategy of positive in-group and negative out-\ngroup presentation, which has an overall legitimating function. At other levels of \ndiscourse, the denial of controversial actions is made manipulative by following \nstrategies of emphasis of our positive and their negative actions with the final \naim of self-legitimating himself and his discourse. The discourse is further made \nmanipulative by using appropriate contextual constraints and defensible semantics\nof representation.\nKeywords: manipulation strategies, self-legitimation, ideological discourse, \npolitical speech\n1. Introduction\nPolitical discourse in general and political speeches in particular have been widely \nstudied to find out what it is that politicians do to convince and appeal to the public. \nIt seems clear that they systematically use the language to obtain political effects, such \nas making the audience believe or do things that are in the interests of politicians \nand against the best interests of the people (Blass 2005; Van Dijk 2003, 2006). One \nwell-known example is governmental and/or media discourse, which is often used \nto blame immigration for the evils of a country’s economy so that citizens do not \nblame the government policies (Van Dijk 2003). This type of discourse is termed manipulative\nand its communication proceeds like any other communicative exchange \nPragmatics 27:2 (2017), 207–234. doi 10.1075/prag.27.2.02cab\nissn 1018-2101 / e-issn 2406-4238 © John Benjamins Publishing Company\n', '208 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\nin the sense that addressees assume speaker cooperativeness (in the Gricean sense) \nand, thus, they attempt to retrieve the speaker’s intention. However, there is really \na “mismatch between speaker intention and the intention attributed to her by the \naddressee” (Maillat and Oswald 2007, 359), which results in the addressee’s manipulation.\nCognitive heuristics and the pragmatics of manipulation attempt to explain \nmanipulative communication by explaining how the human mind processes information\nand how this is exploited to guide irrational beliefs and decisions.\nOne type of political discourse where politicians may be willing to use manipulation\nis Parliamentary discourse. It is formed of interventions (questions, \nanswers, dialogs, whole discourses) before members of Parliament (MPs) that are \nused by politicians for the peaceful resolution of problems. They are often broadcast\non radio and television and reported in the press. A well-known example is \nBlair’s speech in the British Parliament to legitimize the war against Iraq in March \n2003. Parliamentary discourse has characteristics that are typical of other formal \ngenres, such as speaker and turn control by the Speaker of the House, length of \nturns, formal lexicon, complex syntax and the usual structures of argumentation \nand persuasion (Van Dijk 2005a, 8). And, yet, there are forms that are only found \nin Parliamentary discourse, such as forms of address (“Su Señoría” in the Spanish \nParliament ‘Your Honors’); indirect forms of address (the third person singular or \nplural pronoun (“usted/ustedes” ‘you’); the MPs’ first and last names; their current \nfunction (“diputados” ‘MPs’); their honorary title (“don/doña” Mr/Mrs/Ms)); and \nthe use of the first person plural pronoun “nosotros” ‘we.’ According to Van Dijk \n(2005a), what is typical of Parliamentary discourse is the combination of all of them \nand, thus, it can be regarded as a genre in itself. He further indicates:\nWhat is exclusive of parliamentary debates as a genre, however, are such obvious \ncontext categories as the Setting (House of Parliament), the Participants (MPs, opposition,\netc.), the Aims (policies, etc.), 1 and the political knowledge and ideologies \nof the participants. In other words, although content and even style of what is said \nin parliament may be shared by other types of communicative events, the function \nof such structures should be established in relation to the specific political situation: \nThe speakers-MPs are ‘doing’ politics, legislate, represent the voters, govern the \ncountry, and so on (italics in original).\n (Van Dijk 2005a, 8–9)\nIn this study, we attempt to analyze the discursive strategies of manipulation employed\nin a Parliamentary speech made by the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano \nRajoy when defending himself and the party he represents from accusations of \na slush fund run by the Popular Party. The debate has been selected because the \n1. Van Dijk (2005) relies on Dell Hymes’s categories of setting, participants and aims.\n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 209\nspeech came about in a context of a serious economic crisis in Spain and a political \ncrisis engulfing the Popular Party, which required Rajoy to convince politicians and \ncitizens that the accusations of corruption in his party were false. We believe that \nthe discursive strategies used are fundamentally ideological and, thus, are aimed \nat legitimizing the Government’s domain and reproducing it. For the analysis, we \nhave used Van Dijk’s (2006) scheme of manipulative processes, Martin and White’s \n(2005) theory of evaluative language and Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) conceptual \nmetaphor theory so as to examine Rajoy’s speech in Parliament on 1st August 2013. \nThe following research questions will be analyzed:\nWhich types of manipulative process(es) found in Van Dijk’s (2006) categorization \nof manipulation does Rajoy employ to convince the audience (the MPs) that he and \nthe Popular Party are innocent of having received undeclared cash donations? How \nhas Rajoy used the manipulative processes to legitimate his actions?\n2. The concept of manipulation\nBefore embarking on making a theoretical and practical analysis of data, we must \nfirst define the term ‘manipulation’ in political argumentation as an illegitimate \ncontrol used by the manipulator over other people to make them believe that things \nare done in their best interests when, in fact, they only favor the manipulator. \nTherefore, manipulation “not only involves power, but specifically abuse of power, \nthat is, domination” (italics in original) (Van Dijk 2006, 360). It is “intentional” and \n“covert” (italics in original) (Van Eemeren 2005, xi), benefits the speaker’s interest \n(Saussure 2005, 119) and implies an asymmetrical relation between the two parties \ninvolved (Saussure and Schultz 2005, 6). And, yet, the relationship between them \nis based on trust, which the manipulator often gains by engaging in argumentation \n(Blass 2005, 172).\nIn manipulative communication, two layers of intention can be distinguished: \nthe informative intention and the communicative intention (Sperber and Wilson \n1995). Thus, when the manipulator informs the audience of something (i.e. informative\nintention), s/he also communicates an intention (i.e. s/he expresses his/\nher wish to inform the audience of the informative intention); however, this does \nnot coincide with his/her covert manipulative intention. Therefore, it is left up to \nthe listener to endeavor to recover the speaker’s meaning and this may or may not \nalways happen and indeed often does not. Hence, in manipulation we can say that \n“the manipulative intention is covert and not part of the communicative intention, \nin order to hide the deception” (Blass 2005, 177). This is in stark opposition to any of \nthe recognized forms of legitimate manipulation, such as education and persuasion:\n', '210 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\n[…] manipulation could be a form of (legitimate) persuasion […]. The crucial \ndifference in this case is that in persuasion the interlocutors are free to believe or \nact as they please, depending on whether or not they accept the arguments of the \npersuader, whereas in manipulation recipients are typically assigned a more passive \nrole: they are victims of manipulation. This negative consequence of manipulative \ndiscourse typically occurs when the recipients are unable to understand the real \nintentions or to see the full consequences of the beliefs or actions advocated by the \nmanipulator. This may be the case when the recipients lack the specific knowledge \nthat might be used to resist manipulation […].\n (Van Dijk 2006, 361)\nIt seems, therefore, that for Van Dijk the difference between manipulation and \npersuasion lies less on the linguistic features of a given discourse than on the social \nand interactional structures in and by which the discourse acts. Indeed, “social conditions\nof manipulative control […] need to be formulated – at least at the macro \nlevel of analysis – in terms of group membership, institutional position, profession, \nmaterial and symbolic resources and other factors that define the power of groups \nand their members” (2006, 362).\nThe cognitive processes underlying the interpretation of manipulative discourse\nare the focus of attention of the Relevance theory (Allot 2013; Blass 2005; \nSperber and Wilson 1995). According to this theoretical account, human cognitive\nprocesses are “geared to achieving the greatest possible cognitive effect for the \nsmallest possible processing effort” (Sperber and Wilson 1995, vii). This implies \nthat both the speaker and listener are moved to make a cognitive effort on the assumption\nthat this will achieve the greatest positive cognitive effect on the listener \nor speaker, respectively. Since each utterance is “an open attempt to take up some \nof the hearer’s precious attention” (Allott 2013, 79), the speaker is expected to be \noptimally relevant. However, in manipulation the manipulator only seems to be \noptimally relevant when in the act of achieving his/her own ends.\nOne might wonder how easy it is to manipulate an audience. For Sperber \n(2000), humans have a logico-rhetorical ability to check a message for internal and \nexternal consistency (i.e. contextual consistency), which is used “as a means to filter \ncommunicated information, and, […] as a means to penetrate the filters of others” \n(2000, 14). However, manipulators can deceive them into believing manipulated \ninformation by “applying constraints […] on the process of information treatment” \n(Saussure 2005, 117) by using local and global strategies. Local strategies, whether\nlinguistic or non-linguistic, serve to constrain the interpretation of informa-\ntion, whereas global strategies help to create the adequate social and psychological \nconditions for manipulation by resorting to group pressure and by building an \nover-competent image for the manipulator. High rates of some formal features are, \nthus, found in manipulative discourse; however, manipulative discourse is better \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 211\ndescribed as “a type of usage of natural language” (italics in original), which is identified\n“only through notions like goals, intentions, and broader aspects of pragmatic \nprocessing” (2005, 118). Among the local linguistic strategies are rhetorical questions;\nmisuse of concepts; religious discourse; and analogies, metaphors and vague \nterms. The non-linguistic strategies comprise prosodic features, intonation and \neliciting emotional reactions (Saussure 2005, 127). For Saussure (2005, 129–130), \nthe global strategies include recurrent use of specific connotative words; generalization\nof a new terminology; elimination of lexical items from public discourse; \nuse of unmotivated or misleading analogies; use of acronyms, abbreviations and \nnumbers; and naming of elements of the everyday environment. The final aim of all \nstrategies is to “create a global atmosphere where depersonalization is progressively \nintegrated and accepted as conventional and normal” (2005, 130).\nAfter local and global strategies have been used, the listener may display \nthree increasingly sophisticated strategies, which might correspond to different \ndevelopmental stages: naïve optimism, cautious optimism, and sophisticated understanding\n(Sperber 1994). A naïve optimistic listener accepts the first relevant \ninterpretation of information and equates it to the speaker’s meaning, since s/he \nassumes that “the speaker is both competent and benevolent – competent enough \nto avoid misunderstanding and benevolent enough not to lead him astray” (Wilson \n2000, 421). A cautiously optimistic listener is able to deal with those cases in which \nthe speaker has not been relevant and wonders what interpretation the speaker may \nhave intended. In this case, the listener “assumes that the speaker is benevolent but \nnot necessarily competent” (2000, 421). Finally, the sophisticated understanding \nstrategy allows listeners to cope with those utterances that seem relevant, but are \nnot, since “speakers are not always benevolent” (2000, 422). Such is the case of \nmanipulation.\nIn this article we are interested in social domination of the manipulator over \nthe manipulated and its reproduction in discourse. This type of domination implies \n“power abuse, [which] requires special access to, or control over, scarce social resources”\n(Van Dijk 2006, 362). Some of such social resources are, according to Van \nDijk (2006, 362), the mass media or public discourse, which can only be approached \nby elite members of society (politicians, writers, scholars, journalists) by using different\ndiscourse forms: news, newspaper articles, electoral debates, Parliamentary \ndebates and others. 2 Van Dijk expressed it as follows:\n2. In his 2006 publication, van Dijk seem not to be particularly aware of the changing media \necologies brought about by social media and the changes in news consumption patterns more \nbroadly.\n', '212 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\nPower may be defined in terms of control. Normally, this means the power of action:\nA can control (limit, prohibit) B’s actions. Since discourse is a type of action, \nsuch control can also be exercised over discourse and its properties: the context, \ntopic and style. And, given that discourse influences the receptors’ minds, powerful \ngroups can also indirectly control (e.g., through the media) other people’s minds. \nWe are therefore talking about persuasion or manipulation (our translation).\n (Van Dijk 2003, 47)\nNo doubt, the ‘victims’ of such elite members are everyday people who may not understand\nthe elite members’ manipulative moves. But, even more informed ‘victims’ \nsuch as parliamentary members may be manipulated, as they often lack relevant \ninformation that may be in the hands of a few or take decisions ‘forced’ by wider \npolitical consequences.\nFollowing Van Dijk (1998, 2001), this article has an overall multidisciplinary\nframework, which triangulates a social, cognitive and discursive approach. \nManipulation is therefore considered a social phenomenon, since it involves social\nrelations of power abuse between groups or individuals. It is also a cognitive \nphenomenon, because manipulation involves the participants’ minds. Finally, it \nis a discursive phenomenon, because it is exercised through text, talk and visual \nimages (Van Dijk 2006, 361).\n3. Social-political manipulation as an ideological tool\nPolitical manipulation of Parliamentary members has been studied in the discourses\nthat followed the September 11 and March 11 terrorist attacks in New York and \nMadrid (Graham et al. 2004; Leudar et al. 2004) and in Tony Blair’s and George \nBush’s discourse to legitimize their government’s decision to go to war and invade \nIraq (Oddo 2011; Van Dijk 2006). In such discourses as well as in the discourse \nof racism or antiracism (Van Dijk 2000, 2003) lexico-semantic resources are often \ndeployed that serve to legitimate our actions and contribute to the ideological polarization\nthat justifies violence that seems necessary. The concept of ‘ideology’ is \ndefined as follows:\nIdeologies are the foundation of the social beliefs shared by a social group. In other \nwords, a bit like the axioms of a formal system, ideologies consist of those general \nand abstract beliefs, shared by a group, that control or organize the more specific \nknowledge and opinions (attitudes) of a group. (Van Dijk 1998, 49)\nFor Van Dijk (1998, 183), elite ideologies may be successful with dominated groups \neven when their actions are not always in the best interests of their members. This \nmay be explained by the fact that dominant groups often control the means of \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 213\nideological reproduction, which is especially the case of the mass media, and display\nvarious mechanisms of manipulation. These consist in “ton[ing] down the \nobviously inconsistent parts of the ideology and emphasiz[ing] those parts that may \nbe more attractive” (1998, 183), even when they may have multiple negative consequences\nfor the dominated groups, which are, therefore, obscured or eliminated.\nIdeological discourse that is markedly manipulative presents attributes that \nserve the purpose of transmitting the ideology of those in power. Such attributes \nare also “attributes of political discourse (especially parliamentary)” (2003, 96) (our \ntranslation), such as “Us vs. Them” polarization, positive characteristics of “Us”, \nnegative characteristics of “Them” and nationalist feelings. All these categories for \nsocial-political manipulation may affect the meaning of the text, but they may also \naffect the morphology (word formation), lexis and syntax (sentence formation). \nHowever, it is more likely for content to be affected, since “ideological ‘content’ is \nexpressed more directly through discourse meaning” (2003, 58) (our translation). \nVan Dijk (2006, 373) indicates the following discursive strategies of manipulation \n(DSM):\n1. Positive self-presentation vs. negative other-presentation, which is nothing but \na biased presentation of facts in one’s own favor, while blaming the opponents \n(typically, immigrants, the young, terrorists and others). There is, therefore, a \ncategorical division of people as members of a group (We) and non-members \n(They). Ideological positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation \nalso imply the following (2003, 58); they:\n – Emphasized “Our” positive aspects.\n – Emphasized “Their” negative aspects.\n – Deemphasized “Our” negative aspects.\n – Deemphasized “Their” positive aspects.\n2. Macro-speech acts imply “Our “‘good’ acts and “Their” ‘bad’ acts, e.g., accusation, \ndefense.\n3. Semantic macro-structures: topic selection, which is directly related to (de-) \nemphasizing “Our” positive and “Their” negative aspects.\n4. Local speech acts implementing or sustaining the global ones: statements that \nprove accusations.\n5. Local meanings related to “Our/Their” positive/negative actions: We are generally\nmore specific (give more details, are more explicit, are more precise, and \nso on) about our positive points than our negative ones and vice versa.\n6. Lexicon: positive words for us and negative words for them.\n7. Local syntax: the use of active or passive sentences and nominalizations is related\nto an interest in (de-)emphasizing “Our/Their” positive/negative agency.\n8. Rhetorical figures: hyperboles, euphemisms, metonymies and metaphors.\n', '214 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\n9. Use of sound and visuals (order; emphasis by using loud sounds or large and \nbold letters): Information is emphasized by placing it at the beginning of a text, \nsince “information expressed at the head of a sentence has most emphasis as it \nis heard and understood first and as a result better influences the interpretation \nof the rest of the text” (2003, 70) (our translation). Similarly, it can be de-emphasized\nby placing it at the end.\nIn order to consider whether words contribute to the overall positive/negative \npresentation, we use the Appraisal theory, which serves to describe how language \nis used to evaluate and how attitudes, judgments and affects are expressed in text. \nThe Appraisal Theory distinguishes between Graduation (evaluation related to intensification),\nEngagement (evaluation related to the use of different voices) and \nAttitude (evaluation that deals with “our feelings, including emotional reactions, \njudgements of behaviour and evaluation of things” Martin & White 2005, 35). In \nthis study, we concentrate on Attitude for examining ideological positive/negative \npresentation, which includes the following subtypes:\nAttitude\nAppreciation\n(evaluation of reality and humans)  \nReaction: whether we like it or not\nComposition: how the text goes together\nValuation: evaluation of the text content\nJudgment Social sanction: moral regulations & ethics\n(evaluation of human behavior) Social esteem: people’s behavior & their ability to\nlive up to expectations\nHappiness/unhappinessA\x1fect\nSecurity/insecurity(emotional reactions)\nSatisfaction/dissatisfaction\nFor the analysis of metaphors (DSM 8), we have used Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) \nconceptual metaphor theory, which states that two concepts (A and B) are in a \nmetaphorical process when A is understood in terms of B and, thus, “there is a set \nof correspondences between the source and the target in the sense that constituent\nconceptual elements of B correspond to constituent conceptual elements of A” \n(Kövecses 2010, 7). Example: “erosion that some cultivate” (conceptual metaphor: \nharm is/are a plant/crops, source domain: a plant/crops, target domain: harm).\nOne might argue that not all social-political discourse is necessarily manipulative,\nbut it may be persuasive, which makes it necessary to analyze what “contextual \nconstraints prevail, namely on participants, their roles, their relations and their \ntypical actions and cognitions (knowledge, goals)” (Van Dijk 2006, 372). These \ntypically indicate whether the discourse is manipulative or persuasive. It is however \ntrue that, as stated earlier, for manipulation to exist the specific constraints refer \nto the manipulator’s dominant position over the manipulated; the lack of relevant \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 215\nknowledge of the manipulated, which the manipulator is aware of; and the result \nof manipulation being to the manipulator’s own benefit.\nNext, we are going to present the political context that lies behind Mariano \nRajoy’s speech in the Spanish Parliament made to explain the Bárcenas affair.\n4. Mariano Rajoy’s speech in Parliament (1st August 2013):  \nThe political context\nThe political context preceding the speech in Parliament of the Prime Minister, \nMariano Rajoy, was one of economic crisis, high unemployment rates, biting austerity\ncuts to basic services and corruption scandals affecting several political parties \nand the royal household, which brought increased scrutiny to political parties and \nthe monarchy. Public disaffection with the economic crisis gave rise to the so-called \n“Citizens’ wave,” bringing together various protest movements (health services, education,\nsocial services) and the “indignados” (“the outraged”) movement (formed \nby young and old Spaniards alike camping out in Madrid’s main square in 2011 in \nobjection to the modus operandi of the political system and which was linked to \nthe “Occupation” movement in other parts of the world)). Such protest movements \ntook over squares around Spain in protest over privatization, austerity and eviction,\nwhich was leaving families homeless, and forcing the government to debate \na change of the current mortgage law that left families without a house and yet \nstill carrying mortgage debt for life. Mass demonstrations around the country further\nprotested after revelations of apparent corruption cases in the Partido Popular \nparty (henceforth, PP) for several months, which led to a round of instability of \nthe Euro zone crisis. Indeed, a presumed network of political corruption related \nto the PP camp – the Gürtel 3 case – was uncovered by the newspaper El País in \n2009. 4 The leader of the group Francisco Correa and three of his right-hand men – \nÁlvaro Pérez, Pablo Crespo and Antoine Sánchez-were accused of paying millions \nof Euros in kickbacks in exchange for public contracts from the PP administration \nin Madrid, Valencia and Castilla-la-Mancha. The corruption network grew even \nmore in the following years due to their friendship with PP politicians and former \nPresident Aznar’s family, until Correa and his network were finally investigated by \nNational Court judge Baltasar Garzón. Correa, his corruption network, as well as \n3. German translation of “Correa”, which is the last name of the corruption network leader.\n4. The newspaper El País published the article “Perfil de la corrupción: Corrupción a la sombra \ndel poder” [Corruption profile: Corruption to the shadow of power] about “the Gürtel case”, \nwhich revealed the largest corruption scandal in recent Spanish history <http://elpais.com/dia-\nrio/2010/04/18/domingo/1271562756_850215.html>.\n', '216 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\nsome politicians belonging to the PP were accused of bribery, money laundering \nand tax evasion for their alleged illegal activities. The corruption case was handed \nover to judge Ruz when Garzón was himself accused of and found guilty of making \nillegal recordings of conversations between lawyers and their clients. Judge Ruz \nimplicated PP politicians in Alicante and the Balearic Islands and reopened the \nGürtel case against the PP ex-treasurer, Luis Bárcenas, for illegal public contracts.\nIn 2013 the Gürtel case became even more complicated when a further corruption\ncase evolved within the PP party in relation to the Bárcenas affair. The scan-\ndal broke out following the publication of extracts from the former treasurer and \nSenator Luis Bárcenas’s handwritten accounts. 5 These indicated that some senior \nmembers of the PP party had been receiving undeclared cash donations for two \ndecades that came from private building construction companies and other businesses\nand, thus, the PP camp had a double accounting system. The newspaper El \nPaís stated that among those included in the handwritten accounts were the current \nPrime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, and other former ministers (Cué et al. 2013), while \nthe opposing leader Alfredo Pérez-Rubalcaba called on Mariano Rajoy to resign \nover the accusations. Bárcenas denied having written the accounts and, yet, he was \nsent to prison in June 2013 on charges of tax fraud and money-laundering when the \njudge perceived that there was risk of the ex-treasurer leaving the country. When \nthe accused felt that the PP party was not supporting him, he admitted the accusations\nin an interview to the conservative newspaper El Mundo and added that the \ndocuments published by El País were only a small fraction of those he possessed. 6 \nFor Popular politicians, Barcenas’s claims were false and they affirmed that there \nwas only one set of accounts, and this was transparent and legal. 7 For Spaniards, \nwhat the corruption cases really called into question was the then current system, \nwhich seemed rather opaque and easy to manipulate and allowed money to be \ngiven and contracts to be signed under the table by the upper political classes. On \n1st August 2013, Mariano Rajoy addressed the Spanish Parliament upon the threat \nof a motion of censure issued by the opposing party, which demanded he explain \nBárcenas’s accusations of illegal payments from a slush fund in the PP party.\n5. The handwritten accounts have been widely known as “Bárcenas’s papers” (los papeles de \nBárcenas).\n6. The newspaper El Mundo describes the undeclared and untaxed donations received by the \nPP politicians for years and the ex-treasurer Bárcenas’s threats to the PP camp if they did not help \nhim out to avoid prison. See <http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/01/18/espana/1358536985.\nhtml>.\n7. The newspaper El País published on May 15th, 2014 that Judge Ruz considered proved that \nthe PP party had been financed illegally and PP officials had received untaxed extra payments. \nSee <http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/05/14/actualidad/1400099131_887893.html>.\n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 217\n5. Methodology\nFor the study of manipulation, Rajoy’s parliamentary debate (7,582 words) was \ntaken from the Government’s official webpage. 8 The transcript was copied and \npasted in text format to be uploaded to a freeware program called UAM corpus tool, \ndeveloped by Mick O’Donnell. 9 This software is, in fact, a set of tools to annotate the \ntext(s), make searches in the corpus and run descriptive and inferential statistics. \nFor the analysis of manipulative processes, we inserted Van Dijk’s (2006, 373) levels \nof analysis for social-political manipulation explained in Section\xa03 of the article. To \nachieve inter-rater reliability, the researcher analyzed the whole debate and then \nanother researcher, who was also well acquainted with political discourse, analyzed \n30% of the text. Both analyses had 81.58% agreement for levels of analysis. A third \nrater was asked to analyze it, since the rate obtained seemed rather low. This time \nwe reached 87.65% agreement. Those cases in which there was no agreement were \ndiscussed until a consensus was reached.\nBefore the analysis, some terms needed clarification. The distinction between \nsentence and utterance was of great importance, since they did not always coincide. \nA sentence is a grammatical entity derived from the language system, whereas an \nutterance is an “instance of such entity, identified by [its] use in a particular situation”\n(Leech 1995, 14). But a sentence does not always coincide with an utterance. \nAn utterance corresponds to a micro-speech act, which may include one or more \nspeech acts, and be of several types such as greetings, claims, requests.\nFor the study, we carried out a content analysis, assigning labels corresponding\nto the discursive strategies of manipulation (DSM). In most cases, labels were \nassigned to individual sentences (from capital letter to full stop) for DSM 5, 7, 8 \nand 9. However, sentences were analyzed in context (i.e. the sentences occurring \nimmediately before and after the sentence being considered) to understand their \nfull meaning. See Example\xa0(1): 10\n (1) I say so with all frankness: I lacked any reasons to doubt his innocence. So, \nI trusted him and supported him. Yes, I supported him, as I would support \nanyone that went through a persecution that I thought unfair. I believed in his \ninnocence [interaction strategies: negative other-presentation].\n8. The transcript and video of Mariano Rajoy’s intervention in the Spanish Parliament can \nbe found on the Moncloa webpage. <http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/Presidente/Actividades/\nActividadesNacionales/2013/1813Congreso.htm>.\n9. The program can be downloaded for free from the web page: http://www.wagsoft.com/\nCorpusTool/.\n10. All extracts taken from Rajoy’s speech have been translated into English due to space restrictions.\n', '218 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\nIn (1), the first sentence was analyzed as contributing to our positive self-presentation,\nsince the Prime Minister shows himself as not doubting of his friends, until \nevidence shows that the contrary is true. The second and subsequent sentences \nserve to show him as a supporter of his friend and of those going through difficulties \nunfairly. The speech act was considered the unit of analysis for DSM 1, 3 and 4; the \nword or phrase, for DSM 6; and the discourse, for DSM 2. Also, micro-speech acts \nwere often formed of two or more speech-acts, such as the remembrance formula \nused at the beginning of the speech. Thus, given the increasing difficulty for the \nresearchers to analyze the data and reach an agreement, we decided to pre-assign \nthe units of analysis. The results indicate that there were a total of 313 sentences, 1 \nmacro-speech act, 780 words and phrases and 146 micro-speech acts. The quantitative\nexamination was then followed by a qualitative one that gives account of the \ntextual/discursive level of the discourse. Extracts taken from the Prime Minister’s \ndiscourse in Parliament were analyzed at the syntactic, lexical and semantic and discourse\nlevels, using Van Dijk’s (2006) manipulative categories, and analyzing their \ndiscursive logic and interdependence to ideologically mark the text. The extracts \nselected are a number of characteristic fragments of Rajoy’s speech; however, as in \nVan Dijk (2005b), we have not employed any procedures for the selection of the \nfragments, other than those typical of political discourse and, particularly, theories \nof parliamentary debates.\nThe second methodological decision was related to the need to distinguish the \ntextual features that were regarded as expressing Van Dijk’s (2006) strategies. For \nDSM 1 and 6, we analyzed the polarity of words – positive, negative or neutral – \nfollowing Martin and White’s (2005) Appraisal Theory, which explores the language \nof evaluation. Indeed, Van Dijk (2005, 68) considered evaluation to be a “global \nsemantic strategy of positive presentation of Us and negative other-presentation of \nThem” that is typical of political discourse and political language. In the study, the \nwords were examined in each sentence and in context (i.e. the words occurring immediately\nbefore or after the word or phrase under consideration) before deciding \nwhether they had positive, negative or neutral evaluative meanings and, thus, contributed\nto the overall positive/negative presentation. For example, see Example\xa0(2), \nin which “believed” and “supported” have positive evaluative meanings (DSM 6):\n (2) I believed in him and supported him [appraisal: attitude: judgement: property: \npositive]\nThe semantic macrostructure of Rajoy’s speech (i.e. global meaning that organizes the \nlocal meanings of words at the higher levels of paragraphs and discourse (Van Dijk \n2012)) corresponds to the topic of the discourse (DSM 3): the Prime Minister and \nthe party he represented were innocent of the accusations of illicit payments from a \nslush fund, as stated in Bárcenas’s ledgers. It is however true that, for Van Dijk (2012), \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 219\ntopics, like semantic macrostructures, control local meanings and, thus, positive topics\nabout “Us” organize positive local meanings and negative topics about “Them” \norganize negative local meanings. These may range “from words to complex descriptions\nof situations, events, actions, and people” (Van Dijk 2012, 25). To find out about \nthe semantic macrostructure of the speech, utterances were analyzed as “emphasized \nnegative/positive topics” or “de-emphasized negative/positive topics,” whichever being\nthe case at the time, depending on their local meanings. See Example\xa0(3).\n (3) What can I tell them, Your Honors? What’s the use of telling them anything? \n[semantic macro-structure: emphasized negative topics].\nVan Dijk (1992, 215) also distinguished between macro-speech acts and micro-speech\nacts or local speech acts, which take ‘speech act’ as the unit of analysis. \nIn this study, the boundary of a speech act is the clause (also, Şimon 2008, 54), \nsince speech acts can be combined in higher-level speech act sequences; that is, \nsequences of two or more speech acts that depend on each other. Macro-speech \nacts are defined as “the global speech act performed by the utterance of a whole \ndiscourse, and executed by a sequence of possibly different speech acts” (Van Dijk \n1992, 232). Micro-speech acts refer, however, to the structure of individual speech \nacts and the linear structure of speech act sequences. This suggests that the speech \nacts of a discourse are organized linearly in sequences and hierarchically in global\nspeech acts, which serves to give an account of the pragmatic structure of a \ndiscourse (1992, 232). Regarding the macro-speech act (DMS 2), Rajoy’s speech \nfunctions as an act of information (illocutionary act), as it was primarily intended \nto inform about the Bárcenas affair. The perlocutionary act was an act of persuasion \n(i.e. convincing the audience that the Prime Minister and the Popular Party were \ninnocent of the accusations of illegal payments). However, drawing a distinction \nbetween micro-speech acts, which were composed of one or more speech acts, was \na difficult task, since it involved distinguishing between different types of speech \nacts. In the speech, these micro-speech acts were identified: a remembrance, a \nthanks formula, assertions, claims, requests, questions, directions, suggestions, accusations,\nand promises (DMS 4). These follow Brinker’s (1997, 105–121) textual \ncategories (i.e., information, appeal, obligation, contact, and declaration), 11 which \ntake into account an interpersonal relation between at least two participants in the \nspeech communication:\n11. The content of Brinker’s text types overlaps with Searle’s (1969) types. Informatives overlap \nassertives, appellatives with directives, obligatives with comissives, contactives with expressives \nand declaratives with Searle’s declaratives.\n', '220 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\na. A text has an informative function if the addresser uses it to convey information\nto the addressee. An informative text may be descriptive, argumentative \nor narrative.\nb. We speak of a text having an appellative function if the addresser asks the addressee\nto act in a certain way. Appeals take the form of a question or a direction \nto do something.\nc. A text has an obligation function if the addresser commits himself to acting in \na certain way. Obligations take the form of offers and promises.\nd. Texts with a contact function are intended by addressers to get into contact with \nand establish a social relationship with addressees.\ne. Declarations serve the purpose of bringing about a change of the state-of- affairs \nthat coincides with the propositional content of the text.\nIn the present article, the last textual category, declarations, is of no interest, \nsince politicians’ speeches in Parliament do not have a declarative function. See \nExample\xa0(4).\n (4) Let’s talk clearly, Mr. Pérez Rubalcaba [micro-speech act: appeal: suggestion]. \nYour Honor has considered presenting a Motion of Censure as a threat to make \nappear in Parliament [micro-speech act: appeal: accusation]. Don’t threaten \nme, Mr. Pérez Rubalcaba, with a Motion of Censure. As I said at the outset and \nI repeat again now, one doesn’t threaten using the Constitutional instruments \n[micro-speech act: appeal: direction].\nThe final methodological decision referred to the use of a statistical hypothesis test: \nthe one- or two-tailed tests. According to the statistician’s advice (personal communication),\nhypothesis tests were selected because they serve to check whether or \nnot there are differences between the items, as the rates indicate. In the one-tailed \ntest we hypothesize that there are differences between two groups (e.g. positive \nself-presentation vs. negative other-presentation) and we specify in which direction\nthe differences exist (e.g. more positive than negative presentation). In the \ntwo-tailed test, we also predict a difference between two groups; however, we make \nno reference to the direction of the differences. In those cases in which multiple \ncomparisons could be made, we only concentrate on those rates that are closer to \neach other so as to verify that there are really differences between them.\nFor the identification of metaphors, we compared the contextual and basic \nmeanings of the lexical units being examined and decided whether or not the two of \nthem differed (Johnson and Lakoff 1980). If that was the case, the units were marked \nas metaphorical. Ex: “the erosion to Spain’s image that some cultivate” (contextual \nmeaning of “erosion”: image that is gradually damaged, basic meaning: damage \nto the soil; metaphor: harm is a plant). Finally, for the analysis of Attitude, we \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 221\ncarried out a content analysis of the speech, assigning labels corresponding to the \nAppraisal schemes, since we were interested in finding out the way Rajoy used \nlanguage for ideological positive/negative presentation.\n6. Results\nThis section deals with the manipulative strategies used by Mariano Rajoy in his \nspeech in Parliament. We first present and discuss the results for manipulation in \nhis speech 12 in Parliament and, then, explore how he has used them to legitimate \nhis actions before the audience.\nThe results of the study reveal that Rajoy’s speech in Parliament on August 1st, \n2013 has characteristics of ideological discourse, since it is organized by a general \nstrategy of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation that serves \nhim to legitimate his actions and follows the in-group – out-group polarization. \nIndeed, close examination shows that a large proportion of utterances in the speech \nare intended to offer a positive presentation of the speaker and the group Rajoy represents\n(30.14%), while there is also a negative presentation of the opposing party \n(32.19%) in such a way that it legitimates not believing them (T = 0.378, zα = 1.96, \np < .05; since 0.378 ∈ [−1.96, 1.96], then H0: ppos = pneg is rejected, which confirms \nthe result that the rate of utterances for positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation\nis very similar) 13 (see Table\xa01). Similarly, the rate of words or phras-\nes that are positive about “Us” (i.e., positively evaluated) is very similar to the rate of \nwords or phrases that are negative about “Them” (i.e. negatively evaluated): 50.90% \nversus 49.10%, respectively (T = 0.5296, zα/2 = 1.96; since 0.5296 ∈ [−1.96, 1.96], \nwe can conclude that, as expected, the percentage of positive and negative lexicon \nis the same or very similar) (see Table\xa02). Terms referring to the speaker and his \ngroup are, therefore, positive, as are their acts (‘our good acts’): the use of a captatio \nbenevolantie at the beginning of his speech and his closing are part of his overall \nstrategy of positive self-presentation. In the captatio benevolantie, Rajoy remembers\nthose who died in the train accident in Santiago, the rescue members and all \nthose neighbors who helped with the victims, whereas in his closing he shows a \ndisposition to always supporting Spain.\nRight after the captatio benevolantie, Rajoy engages in various forms of positive \nself-presentation, especially given the devastating critique that the accusations of \n12. Due to space restrictions, we only provide the overall percentages of some of the manipulative \nprocesses found in Rajoy’s speech.\n13.

[…] It is not the first time I \nhave spoken about this issue. I already did so in an open hearing for the benefit \nof all Spaniards at the beginning of February and some weeks later we debated \nabout this topic in this House during the Debate about the State of the Nation. \nOn numerous occasions and in diverse scenarios I have been questioned about \nthe same thing.\nTable\xa01.

Lexicon\nFeature Percent N\nlexicon N = 780\nPositive self-presentation 50.90% 397\nNegative other-presentation 49.10% 383\nRajoy’s detailed account of his explanations to MPs and to Spaniards about the \nex-treasurer’s accusations serves him the purpose of demonstrating that he offers \nthe necessary clarifications and, thus, he is a good democrat. The evidence offered\nabout his public appearances is important “to add objectivity, reliability and \ncredibility” (our translation) (Van Dijk 2003, 108) and “contributes to the rhetoric\nof truth” (Martin Rojo and Van Dijk 1997, 536), since all these actions can be \neasily verified. The positive lexicon and the syntax used further enhance him as a \ndemocratic leader, who complies with the law: “I have requested appearing in this \nHouse” [appraisal: appreciation: positive; unmarked word order: positive agency], \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 223\n“clarifications and explanations that I think are necessary” [appraisal: appreciation: \npositive; unmarked word order: positive agency], “open hearing” [appraisal: appreciation:\npositive]. The lexicon is also specific and detailed: “some weeks later we \ndebated this topic,” “on numerous occasions and in diverse scenarios.”\nIt is also imperative for the Prime Minister to provide evidence that explains \nhis unwillingness to appear in Congress to explain the Bárcenas affair: he accuses \nthe current opposition of creating an atmosphere of suspicion that is damaging the \ncountry’s external reputation (see Example\xa06).\n (6) Bringing sterile and unfounded debates to Parliament, riddled with unconfirmed\nsuspicions and partial information can hardly be considered a gesture \nof respect to the House. That is why I haven’t appeared until today. I didn’t \nthink what could be debated here would compensate for the bad effect this \ndebate could have on our external reputation; but we have been pushed to the \nlimit, Your Honors, in which the harm that has been already been caused to the \ncountry’s image and to citizens’ trust has started to become relatively small in \ncomparison to the harm that may be done if Spain does not get into step and \nprovides an answer to what is happening here.\nImplicitly, he aligns himself with those who respect the law and associates the \n“Others” – i.e. the opposition parties (which is especially the case of the leftish party)\nand Bárcenas – with illegality. It is a strategy of legitimization of his policies and \nillegitimization of the “Others”. The positive terms – “respect,” “external reputation” \n[appraisal: attitude: appreciation: social valuation: positive], “that’s why I haven’t \nappeared until today” [appraisal: attitude: judgment: property: positive] – contribute\nto emphasizing the legality and correct procedures of the Government’s actions \nfor Spain’s economic well-being at a moment of great economic distress, while the \nopposing party is damaging Spain’s external credibility with the Bárcenas affair. \nHowever, the negative terms attributed to the Others are negatively evaluated\xa0– \n“sterile and unfounded debates,” “unconfirmed suspicions,” “partial information” \nand “bad effect” [appraisal: attitude: appreciation: social valuation: negative] – and \nadd to the idea that the “Others” are a threat to “Us”. By linking “Them” to partiality,\npolitical interests and harm to Spain’s image, their authority is undermined. \nSimilarly, metaphors – the debate is a container (plagados de sospechas sin \nconfirmar “riddled with unconfirmed suspicions”), spain is a hurt human being \n(“the harm that has already been caused to the country’s image and to citizens’ \ntrust”), and governing is a journey (hemos llegado a un extremo “we have been \npushed to the limit,” si no se sale al paso “if Spain doesn’t get into step”) – serve Rajoy \nthe purpose of pursuing his rhetorical goals of persuasion and, ultimately, of legitimization\nand justification of his decision not to have appeared in Parliament previ-\nously. No doubt, metaphors “allow complex notions and phenomena to materialize \n', '224 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\nin images” (our translation) (Martin Rojo 2000, 135) that are easily understood and, \nthus, contribute to persuasion.\nSyntax also plays the role of ideologically marking the discourse: nominalization,\nmarked word order, and passivization (verbs with se in Spanish, which are \nmore common than the passive voice) ([…] puede difícilmente considerarse […] \n“bringing sterile and unfounded debates to Parliament […] can hardly be considered\n[…]”). These serve to emphasize “Their” negative agency by focusing the \naddressee’s attention on the subject of the sentence. In contrast, in those sentences\nemphasizing “Our” positive agency Rajoy uses the active voice and unmarked \nword order: “That’s why I haven’t appeared until today,” “I didn’t think […].” What \nis important here is that the Prime Minister does not mention the reasons behind \nthe Socialist party’s decision to issue a motion of censure. By only referring to the \nharm that the motion of censure does to Spain’s external credibility, Rajoy dismisses \ntheir reasons and, hence, they are associated with self-interest.\nThe strategy of positive self-presentation further includes de-topicalizing the \ninformation that is inconsistent with Rajoy’s interests, while at the same time topicalizing\nthe information that stresses the negative properties of the opposing party. \nSee Example\xa0(7).\n (7) This is a story that started over four years ago, at the beginning of 2009, when, \none fine day, we learnt that the Popular Party’s treasurer had been charged with \nthe so-called ‘Gürtel case’.\nIn this extract, Rajoy de-emphasizes a sensitive issue for his party – the fact that \nthe ex-treasurer had been legally charged – and he does so by using the schematic \nstructure of a story (‘This is a story that …’) and by leaving the most important \ninformation to the end of the sentence. This way, prominent information is downgraded\nto achieve the effect of distancing from the facts reported and, thus, the \nword order selected has an ideological function. However, in Extract\xa0(8) the Prime \nMinister topicalizes the information that is negative about the opposition’s leader, \nMr. Pérez-Rubalcaba, by using rhetorical questions in anaphoric position aiming \nat putting him in a negative light.\n (8) You know that we need external financing at a reasonable price. We need it \nfor everything. If you know this, as you do, why are you sowing doubts both \ninside and outside Spain? Why are you feeding the suspicions of instability? \nWhy are you sabotaging the trust that Spaniards have gained in the markets? \nWhat great achievement do you expect to attain in exchange for our return to \nruin?  [appraisal: attitude: judgment: property: negative]\nIndeed, the rhetorical questions used serve to highlight a convergent thought: \nthe opposition’s leader acts with dishonesty and moved by self-interest. Also, the \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 225\ndescription is hyperbolic through the use of negative terms (see underlining) and \nthe use of the doubts are crops metaphor (sembrar dudas ‘sow doubts’).\nThe semantic macro-propositions of the speech also serve the Prime Minister \nto emphasize both positive topics about “Us” (e.g., improving the Spanish economic \nsituation, including several measures to tackle corruption, denying any wrongdoing,\nacknowledging a mistake when trusting his ex-treasurer) and negative topics \nabout “Them” (e.g., contributing to the erosion of Spain’s image, telling lies and \nmanipulations, taking advantage of the situation to obtain a benefit). However, \nexamination of the semantic macro-structure of Rajoy’s overall debate reveals \nthat the rate of positive topics is higher (56.85%) than that for negative topics \n(34.25%) (T = 3.981, zα/2 = 1.645, p < .05; since 3.981 ≥ 1.645, then H0: ppos ≥ pneg) \n(see Table\xa03), since Rajoy’s speech in Parliament was mainly to disentangle himself \nfrom the tentacles of a funding scandal in his political party by admitting he had \nmade a mistake when trusting a former disgraced colleague.\nTable\xa03.

Example\xa0(10) shows another major topic in \nRajoy’s debate: denying any illegal behavior and accusing the ex-treasurer of lying.\n (10) Your Honors, I can’t tell you anything else except that his accusations are false, \nhis half-truths are false and the interpretations of the half a dozen truths that \nhe employs as coverage for his falsities are false. The judge will determine what \nis appropriate about each one of the insinuations, but I can tell you in advance \nthat in the Popular Party there has neither been a double accountancy system \nnor has an offence been hidden. Have salaries been paid? Yes. Have complementary\npayments been made for the position occupied? Yes. Have advance \npayments or prepaid expenses been made to be justified as expenses for the \npositions occupied? That too, like everywhere. It is fair. A job has been paid for, \nit has been paid legally and the payment has been included in the accounts.\nIn (10), the semantics are biased to positively evaluate “Us” and “Our” actions and \nnegatively evaluate “Them” and “Their” actions: “It is fair. A job has been paid \nfor, it has been paid for legally” [appraisal: attitude: judgment: property: positive] \nversus “his accusations are false, his half-truths are false […]” [appraisal: attitude: \njudgment: property: negative]. Also, “Our” good acts are explained in detail (see \nExample\xa0(9)) and “Our” controversial acts – the fact that PP politicians get extra\npayments for their work – are explained in euphemistic terms. Therefore, this \nmitigation “is explained in ideological terms (protection of the in-group)” (our \ntranslation) (Van Dijk 2003, 108). Syntax and vocabulary also contribute to enhancing\n“Our” positive and “Their” negative actions through the use of anaphora \nand rhetorical questions. See the following examples:\na. “son falsas […], son falsas […] y son falsas […]” \n[his accusations are false, […] are false, […] are false]\nb. “ni\xa0… ni” \n[neither\xa0… nor]\nc. “¿Se han pagado […]? Sí ¿Se han pagado […]? Sí ¿Se han pagado […]? También” \n[have (subject) been paid […]] Yes (impersonal rhetorical questions)\nd. “Se ha pagado […], se ha pagado […]” \n[a job has been paid for, it has been paid legally]\nThe rhetorical questions in anaphoric position (which use marked word order in \nSpanish) [micro-speech act: appeals: questions] invite the audience to agree with the \nPrime Minister’s words and, thus, be seen as credible and convincing. And, yet, Rajoy \nmostly concentrates on informative micro-speech acts in his argumentation (having \neither marked or unmarked word order), since he had appeared in Parliament to \nexplain the Bárcenas affair and the current economic and political situation in Spain \n(see Table\xa04). In (10) the Prime Minister further displays the argumentative strategy \nof resorting to the law to support his arguments, which is typical of various discourse \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 227\ngenres, such as parliamentary debates (Van Dijk 2003, 71), while he argues against \nthe illegality of Bárcenas’s and the Socialist party’s actions. This way, by appealing \nto the law, he strengthens the legal basis of his decisions: “The judge will determine \nwhat is appropriate about each one of the insinuations.” With this sentence, Rajoy \nfurther uses the well-known strategy of leaving implicit meaning in the text, which \nconsists in “presupposing information that is not shared or generally accepted and \nintroducing it ‘through the back door’” (our translation) (2003, 61). No doubt, with \nhis words Rajoy implies that the claims over illegal payments from a slush fund run \nby the ex-treasurer are malicious insinuations; a claim that was not shared by many \npoliticians in the audience, but one that could not be proven as false either.\nTable\xa04.

He attempts to convince the audience that he is the victim of Bárcenas’s and the \nopposing party’s manipulative moves. For that purpose, he tries to demonstrate \nthat his arguments are solid and, thus, he is a solid speaker (see Example\xa011).\n  (11) It is not up to me nor the Government, nor even the Chamber, but to \njudges to establish the truth about Mr. Bárcenas’s malicious insinuations.\n2. He attacks the opposing party for supporting the ex-treasurer to benefit their \nown political interests even at the expense of truth. For his attacks, he uses the \nopposition party’s leader’s own words as a powerful weapon – irony –, which \ndoes not leave anyone indifferent 14 (see Example\xa012).\n14. On the aftermath of the discourse numerous newspapers commented on Rajoy’s strategy \nto attack the opposing leader’s party Rubalcaba and its winning effect: [Rajoy has consistently \npunctuated his discourse with Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba’s literal quotations so as to transform \nthem into an accusatory boomerang. Each expression was ended with the popular #end-ofquote\n(official trending topic). The tone and the gesture accompanied Rajoy’s hammer drill. […] \nRajoy’s textual quotations have formed a winning lever. The attack has been frontal. Definitive \nbroken bridges”] (own translation). (Gutiérrez-Rubí, A. El País, 2013 <http://blogs.elpais.com/\nmicropolitica/2013/08/fin-de-la-cita.html>).\n', '228 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\n  (12) It has been rightly said and I quote: “judges in Spain are the ones who \ndecide if accusations are true or not” (end of quote). Therefore, Your \nHonors, “I’ll wait for justice to finish its work. It’s what’s reasonable and \nwhat should be done in all cases”.\n3. He uses fallacies to support his argumentation. For example, he uses an ad hominem\nfallacy (i.e. attacking the negative qualities of someone making a claim) \nto disregard the opposing party’s accusations (see Example\xa013).\n  (13) Your Honors, it’s impossible for me to satisfy those who proclaim beforehand\nthat my explanations “do not coincide with the truth.” It seems \nsome people enjoy the benefit of already knowing the truth; thus, for \nthat reason they are not required to say anything.\n4. He uses frequent generalizations. For example, see Example\xa014.\n  (14) When one of my collaborators has undergone political or personal \ndifficulties, I have shown him my support and solidarity. I have always \nacted like that.\nIn contrast, as part of Rajoy’s general strategy of negative “Other-presentation”, he \nalso refers to the ex-treasurer, the opposing party and their leader in strongly negative\nterms (‘their bad acts’) and he does so often and implicitly (see Example\xa015).\n (15) Honors, everyone knows that for Mr. Bárcenas it would have been impossible \nto create the scandal he tried to create, had he not had invaluable aids. There \nhave been some who, individually or in group, have decided to take advantage \nof the situation for their own benefit. I am referring, among others, to those who \napplaud and cheer the deceit of papers and photocopies; those who transform \nevery insinuation into vehement accusations, believing certain and proved all \nthat is published and ignoring all that is refuted; those who see crimes with the \nsame ease as they first saw green shoots; those who set themselves up judges to \ncondemn without proof; those who allow themselves to be dragged along by an \nuncontrollable urgency and prefer not to wait until the truth is known, maybe \nbecause they are worried about the risk of not liking the truth or it not being in \ntheir interest, or because they do not have the political time to find out about it.\nIn (15), Rajoy accuses the “Others” (the Socialist party) of unfairly accusing him and \nhis party without proof and he does so by giving specific negative details about “Their” \nactions in an attempt to convey a negative image about “Them”. Certainly, the syntax \nof the sentences serves to ideologically mark the text, since the “Others” are the subject \nand topic of sentences: “those who applaud …; those who transform ….” This way, \n“negative properties attributed to outgroups may be enhanced by focusing on their \nresponsible agency” (Van Dijk 2011, 24). Agency and responsibility of the “Others” \nare further enhanced by using parallel syntactical structures, in which “los que” (those \n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 229\nwho) is repeated at the beginning of each sentence (anaphora). Such description associates\nthe “Others” with unethical behavior and, thus, their credibility is reduced.\nFurther examination of the words used to describe “Us” and “Them” in \nExtract\xa0(15) reveals that they are fundamentally different: the “Others” are referred \nto indirectly on the majority of occasions (“those who see crimes”, “those who set \nthemselves up as judges”), since “the option […] is not neutral” (our translation) \n(Van Dijk 2003, 60) in the knowledge that the audience will infer the missing meaning\nfrom their own discourse model or from the socio-cultural knowledge they have \n(2003, 60). However, the ex-treasurer is directly referred to as “Mr. Bárcenas,” while \nRajoy refers to “Us” – the PP Government – as “the Government” (see Example\xa010) \nand, thus, the words present no evaluative items, but are only used in terms of the \nrole they play in the country. As in Martin Rojo and Van Dijk (1997, 543), we find \nthat the forms selected contribute to the legitimation of discourse; that is, “through \nthese forms, differences in authority and status are emphasized, and the authority \nof the institution is transferred to its representative and his discourse, while others \nare deprived of authority and social status.” Also, in Example\xa0(15) the words and \nphrases are negative about “Them” (i.e. negatively evaluated) and the metaphors \nemphasize “Their” negative properties. Indeed, when referring to the opposing party,\nwho are supporting the ex-treasurer to benefit their own interests, Rajoy employs \nseveral negative terms: “create the scandal,” “take advantage of the situation for their \nown benefit,” “transform every insinuation into vehement accusations” [appraisal: \nattitude: judgment: property: negative]. Similarly, the container for contained \nmetonymy (“papers and photocopies” 15 for “handwritten accounts”) and the \neconomy is a plant (“green shoots”), 16 urgency is an  uncontrollable force \n(“be dragged along by an uncontrollable urgency”) and the socialists are an \naid for law breakers metaphors (“invaluable aids”) are negative about “Them”. \nTherefore, the negative terms contribute to the idea that the “Others” are a threat to \n15. PP politicians dismissed Bárcenas’s secret ledgers as “photocopies of photocopies” (Collado, \nA. 2013. El PP desacredita los papeles de Bárcenas: “fotocopias de fotocopias” escritas de una \nsentada). [PP dismisses Bárcenas’ papers: ‘photocopies of photocopies’ written in one sitting].

The Socialist Minister of Economy, Elena Salgado, was the first to use the expression “green \nshoots” in 2009 to talk about some incipient signs of recovery in the Spanish economy. The \nSocialist also made an electoral video, which showed a small plant growing on arid land (“El \nPSOE exhibe sus brotes verdes en su ultimo video electoral” [PSOE exhibits their green shoots \nin their latest electoral video] El País 2009). The expression was the butt of jokes, criticisms and \nhumorous references on television, and also used by those opposing the Government, who employed\nit ironically to mock the Socialist economic policies: “It seems that the green shoots are \nof marihuana and Zapatero has smoked them” (Europa Press 2009 <http://www.20minutos.es/\nnoticia/471953/0/bortes-verdes/marihuana/zapatero/>).\n', '230 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\n“Us” – the PP Government and Spaniards. These results suggest that, also lexically \nand rhetorically, the speech contributes to the overall function of legitimation by \nusing manipulative discourse.\nThere is little doubt that Members of Parliament understand perfectly Rajoy’s \nmoves of legitimization and manipulation, which would make them ‘victims’ of \nlegitimate persuasion rather than powerless ‘victims’ of manipulation. And, yet, \nthere are some contextual properties that can help us to distinguish between persuasion\nand manipulation. First, MPs lack crucial information that only belongs to \nthe Government, which makes them susceptible to manipulation (e.g., despite the \nevidence, they cannot claim that the PP party had a double accounting system; they \nhave no access to the documents that show the exact time period when Bárcenas \nwas the PP party’s treasurer; they cannot claim that PP party leaders had received \npayments on the side and, thus, they gave the donors political favors or contracts in \nexchange for the money). Second, PP MPs can hardly reject Rajoy’s speech without \nputting the PP Government and the Prime Minister at risk. Third, no PP MP can \nacknowledge knowing about the existence of a slush fund in his party and hope to \nkeep his job. Fourth, not supporting Rajoy’s words may be explained for PP MPs \nas taking sides with the Socialist party. Obviously, non-PP MPs are not in such a \ntight position and, thus, can refuse to be manipulated (some did, since politicians \nfrom various political parties responded to Rajoy’s speech and rejected his words). \nIn sum, the PP MPs may have been manipulated into accepting Rajoy’s words and \ninto accepting the concrete act of some senior PP politicians’ receiving illegal payments\nwithout them having political consequences.\n7. Conclusions\nThe present study attempted to find out which manipulative processes Rajoy employed\nin his Parliamentary speech on 1st August 2013 so as to convince his audi-\nence that he and the Popular Party were innocent of receiving cash bonuses. The \ndebate was selected because it came about within a context of a serious economic \ncrisis in Spain and a political crisis in the Popular Party, which made it a good candidate\nfor manipulation to legitimate the party’s actions. For the analysis, we used \nVan Dijk’s (2006) categorization of manipulation. Theoretically, manipulation is an \nillegitimate control of the manipulator over the manipulated so as to deceive them \ninto believing that things are done to their best advantage, when they only benefit \nthe manipulator. We also used Martin and White’s (2005) Appraisal theory to study \nthe language of evaluation and Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) conceptual metaphor \ntheory to study metaphors.\n', ' Manipulation as an ideological tool 231\nIn this study, the analysis of manipulation has concluded that Rajoy’s speech \npresents characteristics of ideological discourse, since it follows the general strategy\nof positive in-group presentation and negative out-group presentation, which \nhas an overall legitimating function. “Our” good actions are described as correct \nand beneficial, at a specific and detailed level and are evaluated positively, whereas\n“Our” controversial actions are either ignored, described with few details or \nin euphemistic terms. “Their” bad actions are however described as deviant and \nthreatening to “Us”, with great detail and in hyperbolic terms. All this is accomplished\nwith the aim of justifying Rajoy’s words that he and his party are innocent \nof the ex-treasurer’s accusations. At other levels of discourse, such denial of controversial\nactions are made manipulative, e.g., by lexical derogation of the “Others”, \nsyntactic and discourse order emphasis, concealment of agency and responsibility, \nthematically and rhetorically enhancing positive or negative actions and by adding \npositive or negative evaluations. However, the Prime Minister not only attempts to \nexplain the negative properties of the “Others” based on a particularly unfavorable \nsituation, but also he tries to offer the audience a general negative image of the \n“Others”: the ex-treasurer is represented as breaking the law and a deviant, while \nthe Socialist party are seen as being driven by self-interest and dishonesty. At the \nsame time, Rajoy manages his own image and that of his party with a general positive\nstrategy of self-presentation: he represents himself and his party as democrats \nwho scrupulously respect the law, follow the principles of democracy, worry about \nSpaniards’ economic stability and work hard to achieve it.\nManipulation of the audience may have been successful with some politicians \nsince some requirements are met: the Prime Minister is in a dominant position over \nthe audience, non-PP MPs lack crucial information that Rajoy is aware of, while \nPP MPs feel compelled by political circumstances. Also, Rajoy is seen to tell the \ntruth, give solid arguments and describe actions that can be verified and, thus, his \naccount of the events is seen as credible and those of the “Others’” as non-credible. \nHe further uses strategies to enhance the audience’s feeling that the discourse is true: \ndescribing details, referring to reliable sources such as authoritative institutions (the \nHigh Court of Justice, the Public Prosecution) and the law, emphasizing his authority\nas the President of the Government and that of his party as the party in power \nby the electors’ choice in the Presidential Elections, presenting himself as honest \nand reliable, providing proof and evidence for his words and using convincing arguments\n(although fallacious, on occasions). At the same time, Rajoy de-emphasizes \nthe “Others’” authority by associating them with self-interest, a violation of the law \nand, hence, with crime. These strategies of legitimization and de-legitimization \nare, therefore, linked to manipulation and “contribute to the management and the \nreproduction of power” (Martin Rojo and Van Dijk 1997, 562). Needless to say \n', '232 Ana Belén Cabrejas-Peñuelas\nthat, despite the requirements for manipulation, non-PP MPs understood Rajoy’s \nmanipulative moves and were able to reject his words; however, PP MPs felt politically\nobliged to accept the Prime Minister’s words and could be, thus, helpless \nbefore manipulation.\nFuture studies could find out whether or not Rajoy’s discourse served to manipulate\nthe wider audience who watched the broadcasting emission of the speech \nand whether or not he actually achieved his purpose.\nReferences\nAllott, Nicholas. 2013. “Relevance Theory.” In Perspectives on Linguistic Pragmatics, ed. by \nAlessandro Capone, Franco Lo Piparo, and Marco Carapezza, Vol. 2, 57–98.
