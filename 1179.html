At the\nsame time July options fell off 2%\ncents. The sharp decline was due to\nthe general liquidation, participated In\nby many of the large holders. The\nfirst signs of the seeming collapse of\nthe May deal brought out numerous\nstop loss orders, thus increasing the\nweakness. May opened at $1.18, to\n$1.18%,\npractically the closing figures\nof the previous day. The initial quo\xad\ntations on July were at $1.01% to\n$1.01%.

Nearly a dozen squaresu of\nmodern wharves and freight sheds, two\nmagnificent grain elevators, hun\xad\ndreds of loaded cars and vast quanti\xad\nties of freight, Including 20,000 bales\nof cotton, were destroyed, together\nwith a large number of small re\nsi\ndenes. The fire was still raging fu\xad\nriously at midnight, at which time it\nbad almost reached the upper end of\nthe Illinois Central property.\nIt has not been determined whether\nthere has been any loss of life. The\nocean-going shipping seems to have\nescaped serious damage. A number\nof firemen and employes of the docks\nwere injured. Actual estimates of the\nlosses are impossible at present,\nthough they may exceed $5,000,000.\nThe Stuyvesant docks extended from\nLouisiana avenue almost to Napoleon\navenue, a distance of twelve squares.\nThe wharves between these two points\nwere covered with miles of trackage\nand steel and iron sheds ran the\nwhole distance.\nWork of Years Wiped Out\nThe two grain elevators were of the\nmost modern construction, the upper\none having a capacity of 1,000,000\nbushels. ^Thousands of bales of cot\xad\nton, several hundred thousand pack\xad\nages of sugar, great quantities of cot\xad\ntonseed oil and oil-cake, lumber and\nevery conceivable variety of freight\nfilled the warehouses and sheds. Prac\xad\ntically all the export business handled\nby the Illinois Ceutral was put aboard\nships at these docks. The docks and\nimprovements have been under con\xad\nstruction for ten years past.\nThe fire was discovered shortly after\n7 o\'clock. It was said to have result\xad\ned from a journal that had not been\nsufficiently oiled. The whole plant was\nequipped with gigantic water tanks\nand fire extinguishing apparatus, but\nthe blaze, small at the beginning, al\xad\nmost instantaneously got beyond con\xad\ntrol, communicating through the con\xad\nveyors to the lower elevator and some\nof the sheds. The response of the fire\ndepartment was prompt but owing to\nthe fact that the terminals were not\nreadily accessible because of fences\nand tracks the engines found difficulty\nin reaching the flames, to half an\nhorn\' the (Ire Covered two squares, the\nlower elevator was practically consum\xad\ned and the fire was sweeping with ir\xad\nresistible fury both up and down the\nriver. Harbor tugs hastened to the\nwharves and vessels that were moor-\'\n•d there were pulled out into the river.\nSwitch engines were rushed to the\nwharves and hundreds of loaded\nfreight cars were drawn to points\nabove the upper end of the terminals\nbefore the ftre reached them. Hun\xad\ndreds more, however, were consumed.\nMany Residences Destroyed.\nThe wind was blowing down the\nriver as the blase began and the fire\n•B&ad with greater speed to that di\xad\nPRICE FIVE CENT*.\nJUDGE SWAYNE\nmm\n1\nsilt"\nparty linek, Bard, Kittredge, McCum\xad\nber and Nelson, republicans, voting\nwith the democrats for conviction and\nDubois and Gibson casting their bal\xad\nlots with republicans for acquittal. At\nthe conclusion of the voting the pre\xad\nsiding officer directed the secrelary to\nenter an acquittal upon the records\nand Che court then adjourned without\ndelay.\nJudge Swayne was not in the sen\xad\nate during the roll calls, but was in\nthe president\'s room just back of the\nchamber.

By 9 o\'clock the lower eleva\xad\ntor and sheds and wharves frost\nAmelia street to Louisiana avenue, a\ndistance of six squares, had fallen in.\nFortunately Louisiana avenue is a very\nbroad thoroughfare and the further\nspread of the fire beyond that point\ninto a residence section was checked.\nBetween the points named, however,\nthe flames swept to complete destruc\xad\ntion many cottages of the poorer\nclasses, the occupants in a great many\ninstances losing all they possessed.\nThe river boats, the employes of the\nroad and the fire department concen\xad\ntrated all their energies in an effort\nto save the upper elevator between\nAusterlitz and Constantinople streets\nand to check the fire at that point.\nHie fire, however, gradually worked,\npast the point occupied by the eleva\xad\ntor. Heroically, the forces kept at\nwork, but ultimately tftey were beaten\nand the big steel structure, covered\nwith corrugated iron, suddenly burst\ninto flames at 10:30 and in half an\nhour was a complete wreck.\nAt midnight more than nine squares\nof the terminals had been completely\ndestroyed and it seemed unlikely that\nthe fire would be checked until it\nreached Napoleon avenue, which\nis a very broad street.\nDuring the fire a heavy wind blew\nand the blaze was of indescribable\nfury, carrying brands to great dis\xad\ntances. driving back the crowds of\nsightseers.\nBEHIND IN ITS WOEK\nSEVEN IMPORTANT APPROPRIA\xad\nTION BILLS STILL BEFORE\nTHE SENATE.\nWashington, Feb. 27.—At the begin\xad\nning of the last week of the present\nsession only one of the regular appro\xad\npriation bills has been finally acted on\nby congress and approved by the presi\xad\ndent. This is the legislative, execu\xad\ntive and judicial bill. Six other sup\xad\nply bills have passed both houses and\nare in conference. With only five days\nof the session left the senate still has\nseven of the most important appro\xad\npriation bills to consider to whole or\nin part.\nOf the seven the naval and the In\xad\ndian bills have been partly read and\nsome features of the naval bill have\nbeen discussed. Senators generally\nappreciate the fact that the task of\ncompleting consideration of all these\nmeasures before the close of the ses\xad\nsion at 12 o\'clock next Saturday, is\ngigantic, but none of them doubts that\nIt will be accomplished. In order to\ndo all that is requisite it will be neces\xad\nsary to greatly prolong the day\'s sit\xad\ntings and it is the present expectation\nthat the hour of convening each day\nwill be fixed at 10 o\'clock and that the\ndaily sessions will be extended con\xad\nsiderably beyond the usual hour of ad\xad\njourning. All night sessions are prob\xad\nable the last few days of the week.\nThe week\'s work will begin with\nvoting on the Swayne impeachment\ntrial during the first day, and it is ex\xad\npected the voting will consume about\nthree hours of time. No debate will\nbe allowed. A separate vote will be\ntaken on each of the impeachment\narticles and on every vote each sena\xad\ntor\'will be expected to rise formally in\nhis place and say whether he consider*\nJudge Swayn* guilty or not guilty,\na\ntwo-thirdB vote will be necessary to\nimpeach on any one of the charges.\nAs soon as the Bwayne case to dis\xad\nposed of the naval appropriation bin\nwill be taken up and that will be frt\ntowed fey the Indian, the postofltae and\ntiie pension appropriation btlls la the\ntrder named.', 'SsaM\ntts-l\nWrk\npjM^l5f.y.r -.*{?.#,-._(•\n^\'y VW.\n|»iy,\n®be §i$ma*fk Iribtwe.\nBY M.

It has a wide circulation and is a\ndesirable advertising1 -medium. Being pub\nCshed at the capital of the state it makes a\nfeature of state news, of a semi-official char\xad\nacter, and is therefore particularly \'interest\xad\ning to all who desire to keep the run of state\naffairs—political, social and business.\nAfter viewing the display of pottery\nware made from Dickinson clay and\nshown at the capitol, the most skepti\xad\ncal must be convinced of the value of\nthis deposit if properly developed and\nworked. This clay was sent to Ohio\nand New Jersey, where, after due ex\xad\nperimenting as to tempering, the fin\xad\nished product was made as shown.\nMany different varieties of art work\nhave ibeen evolved from the same clay\nshowing a wide range of manufactur\ning possibilities and it would seem\nbut a short time must elapse before\nprofitable pottery plants would be es\xad\ntablished on the site of the deposits.\nIt is claimed that as good quality of\npottery clay has been located at Heb\xad\nron, in Burleigh county, and at other\npoints, which seems to indicate a\nwide area in which this valuable min\xad\neral product can foe found, and it may\nyet come true, as predicted by one of\nour leading mineralogists, that there\nis more wealth under the ground in\nthis state than will ever be developed\nupon the surface. The showing made\nat the capitol certainly furnishes in\xad\ncentive for" energetic action toward\nthe development of the pottery indus\xad\ntry in North Dakota.\nSenator LaMoure introduced a bill\nin the senate yesterday to give the\nstate officers authority to issue new\nbonds in place of the $154,000 of bonds\nthat will be taken up in April. This\nIs within the present debt limit of the\nstate and will make available this\namount of funds for the present needs\nof the state, and was taken into con\xad\nsideration In the making of appropria\xad\ntions./ The present debt limit of the\n.state/is low—much more sp than in\nthe great number of states—and the\npassage of this bill Is necessary if the\nestate Is to have any leeway in the ex\xad\npenditure of funds under the appro\xad\npriations at present contemplated.\nWhile an active interest is being\ntaken in irrigation matters In this\ncountry it should be borne in mind\nthat we are nob. ahead of our neigh\xad\nbors on the north where great ditches\nare mow being constructed and thous\xad\nands of acres of land redeemed and\nmade valuable for immigrants. On\nanother page appears a cut showing\na section of the construction work on\nthe great irrigation canal bei^g con\xad\nstructed by the Canadian Pacific rail\nway in the Calgary country.\nThe railroads have about perfected\narrangements for transportation facili\xad\nties to the Pacific coast and the Port\xad\nland exposition this year.

Out of\nthe government irrigation fund $2,\n500,000 has been appropriated for this\nwork.\nThe first project is on the Belle\nFourche river. This project will re\xad\nquire six miles of inlet ditch from\nthe river to the reservoir site, and\nwill take all the water from the\nstream at the point where it is tapped.\nThe reservoir will cover 8,800 acres,\nbeing twelve miles long, and will have\'\nsixty-two feet as its maximum depth.\nLeading from the reservoir out over\nthe section/to be irrigated will be\neighty miles of main: ditch, and about\n500 miles of laterals to carry the\nwater directly to the land to be wat\xad\nered. The plan comprises the irri\xad\ngation of 90,000 acres..\nThe average amount of water es\xad\ntimated to be required on the lira/*\neach year, in addition to the average\nrainfall, is eighteen inches, and the\nreservoir will hold in storage a suf\xad\nficient- amount to place thirty-three\ninches over the whole tract to be ir\xad\nrigated under present plans.\nA section has been selected in the\nheart of the district for town pur\xad\nposes, and, while the town has been\nneither platted nor named, Engineer\nR.

JOHN P. IRISH TALKS IN\xad\nTERESTINGLY ON THE QUE8-.\nTION OP IRRIGATION.\nMAXWELL 18 PAID TO MANIPU\xad\nLATE LAW8 IN FAVOR\nOF RAILROADS.\nThe following letter of Col. Irish is\ncopied from the San Francisco Even\ning Post:\nEditor Post: have read without\nsurprise the irrigation interview of\nMr. C. E. Boothe. He says: "Colonel\nJohn P. Irish, who has attended some\nof the congresses as the representa\xad\ntive of the cattlemen, is also a resi\xad\ndent of this section. Whether or not\nColonel Irish has exerted influence on\nthe press and people of this part of\nthe state I do not know. But I do\nknow that Colonel Irish has been an\nactive lobbyist in the interests of tho\ncattlemen for many years at our con\xad\ngresses."\nI attended the first Irrigation Con\xad\ngress at Salt Lake and helped organ\nize it. I attended the last congress\nat Ogden in 1903 and have been at\nno other meeting of that body. It\nis an arrant and impudent falsehood\nthat on either occasion I appeared as\nan attorney or lobbyist of the cattle\xad\nmen. It is also a falsehood that the\ncattlemen oppose the federal irriga\xad\ntion law. The National Livestock\nAssociation and the American Cattle\xad\nmen\'s Association have always fav\xad\nored and supported forest reserves,\nthe conservation of water and every\nplan for applying it in irrigation. The\ncattlemen proposed a law to lease the\n400,000,000 acres of public land that\nis fit for grazing and for nothing else\nbut to safeguard all rights they pro\nvided that all leaseholds should be\nopen to the homesteader and th\nmineral prospector and the irrigator\ngovernment or individual.\nIn these two falsehoods Mr. Boothe\nshows his unfitness to be in any rep\xad\nresentative capacity. His trouble is\nthat he esteems himself to be the\narid west and Mr. George Maxwell to\nbe the irrigating canal, and in a cer\xad\ntain sense this conception is true.\nFor Mr. Boothe is dry, very dry, with\nthat sort of drought that is slaked\nby currency, and Mr. Maxwell who is\npaid $30,000 a year by the land grant\nrailroads to manipulate the land laws\nin their interest, moistens Mr,\nBoothe\'s parched feocket.\nAt the last congress in Ogden\ntried to have this year\'s meeting at\nReno, Nev., where there Is an object\nlesson in federal irrigation in the\ngreat canal now under construction\nBut Maxwell and Boothe made an al\xad\nliance with the Mormon Church\nwhich wanted the congress held\nin Texas on account of its\ncolonies near by in Mexico\nNow the federal governmen\ndoes not own a foot of land in Texas\nand\' the federal irrigation law does not\napply in that state. The congress\nmight as well have been held in the\nmiddle of the Pacific ocean. 1 repre\xad\nsented the Water and Forest society\nof California and wanted! something\npractical done by the congress. But\nBoothe, Maxwell and their party, who\nirrigate with wind, do not want any\xad\nthing practical. They are the grafters\non a great movement and have com\xad\nbined to make the congress- ineffec\xad\ntive. Mr. Boothe\'s patronizing refer\xad\nences to northern and central Califor\xad\nnia are amusing. He deprecates the\nnon-appreciation of irrigation north\nof the Tehachapi. But the fact is that\nwe have irrigated a hundred acres to\nsouthern California\'s one and have\nthousand irriga/ble acres to southern\nCalifornia\'s one, and ten thousand\nacre feet to her one to do the work.\nMr. Boothe is interesting as an artist\nin misrepre&ntation and furnishes\nground for Ananias to move for a new\ntrial.\nJOHN P.
