Then she\nsmiled sweetly at Mary and Nettie.\nShe was glad to see the owners of\nthose angry faces disappointed in\ntheir lofty hopes of a rich legacy.\nThe reading of the will of old Rob-\nThe Reading of the Will of Old Rob\nert Burr Ended,\nert Burr ended, all Interest of most\nof the relatives present died out, for\nhe had favored few of them, and those\nwith no marked liberality. There was\na great confab at the Dalton home\nthat evening. Alice was an orphan\nand lived with the Daltons. The Win\nstods lived only next door, and Mary\nand Nettie came over to discuss the\ngreat event of the day and abuse their\ndead relative.\n"Humph! his old portrait can go to\nthe barn loft, for all I\'ll hinder,” de\nclared Mary, spitefully.\n”’ln loving remembrance!’” quoted\nNettie, sneeringly. "I hope some one\nsmashes a stepladder In It when they\ngo to hang It in my room.”\n"I shall retire my precious legacy\nas soon as the decent period of mourn\ning has passed,” observed Esther,\nIcily, as though she were punishing\nthe relative who had failed to cater to\nher extravagant tastes.\nAlice said nothing. She had always\nhad a warm spot In her loyal little\nheart for Uncle Robert. She was In\na measure dependent upon the Dal\ntons, but well earned her way. Espe\ncially, since the gift of the piano she\nhad been able to pay a fair cash price\nfor her board, besides helping in many\nlittle household duties which the\nhaughty Esther disdained.\nA month later the really prized por\ntrait hung In a cherished way in the\npoorest room in the house, which of\ncourse was the one to which uncom\nplaining Alice was assigned. Esther\nhad placed her legacy in her brother’s\nneglected den. The Winsted girls\nopenly boasted that theirs had found\nstorage in an unoccupied servant’s\nroom. Then there came along one\nWorth Davenal, and the complexion\nof the four young girlish lives was vi\ntally affected by the occurrence.\nHe was a bright, manly young fel\nlow, What pleased the Winsted girls\nwas that he was reputed rich. He\nwas the favored nephew of a prosper\nous city stockbroker. Esther set her\ncap for him at once. This caused a\nbitter break in her relation with Mary\nand Nettie, and the harmony of the\n• little coterie of cousins was broken in\nupon,\nEsther was pretty, but bold as well.\nShe simply started out to appropriate\nthe distinguished visitor to the town\nall to herself. Young Davenal was,\nhowever, no more attentive to her\nthan to the others. Alice greatly ad\nmired the manly, free-hearted fellow,\nand from the first he seemed to enjoy\nher company. Twice, however, once\nbecause of necessary attention to\nsome pupils, and again when Mrs. Daf\nton fell ill and wished some one to\nkeep her company, Alice disappoiirtetj\nMr. Davenal in engagements, and this\nseemed to nettle him. It was possible\nthat Esther created some false im\npression In his mind as to the true\nfacts of the case. At all events, he\nbecame quite a regular escort to Bs\nTHURMONT, FREDERICK COUNTY, MD., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1915.\nther, and the Wlnsteds gave up the\ncontest.\nNot so Alice. She felt that she had\nstood aside too often to please Esther\nand the others. She had time and\nagain sacrificed her pleasure for their\nbenefit. She had been more or less a\ndrudge In their service. Now jeal\nousy and petty scheming, she was cer\ntain, was discrediting her with a man\nwhose friendship she valued. She\nwished to stand well In his eyes. The\nopportunity to vindicate herself came\none evening when, at a lawn party,\nshe found herself alone on a rustic\ngarden bench with Mr. Davenal.\nShe felt it her duly to tell him the\ntruth regarding the reasons why she\nhad broken her engagements wit a\nhim. She was surprised to see the\ndeep shadows that crossed his face\nas she spoke.\n"I was informed wrongly,” he said,\nhis voice unsteady with some deep\nemotion suddenly revealed. ”1 —I was\npiqued at your indifference. I—and1 —and\nnow it is too late!”\nThey were interrupted at that mo\nment. “Too late”—for what? The\nwords rang in Alice’s ears for hours\nCould it be possible that he had cared\nfor her, that he had been cajoled into\nengaging himself to Esther, that now\nliis eyes were opened to the truth?\nBefore Alice could fathom the\ndepths of the complication there came\nstrange and disturbing news. The\nrich relative of Worth Davenal had\nplunged 100 deeply in his stock ex\nchange speculations, had lost his en\ntire fortune and both he and his pros\npective heirs were beggars.\nThen came the climax. Esther\nturned against Worth In disdain. One\nday he met Alice. He found her the\nloyal friend she had proved to be.\nShe advised him, she encouraged him\nwhen he sought work like the man\nhe was. Then true love shone forth.\nThey became engaged. At the end of\nthe year, In a modest but happy home\nthey set up housekeeping amid the\nsneers of Alice’s three cousins con\ncerning “those paupers!"\nOne day there came to the humble\ncottage the executor of Uncle Rob\nert’s estate.\n“Mrs Davenal,” he said, pleasantly,\nwith a glance at the portrait of her\ndead relative occupying a prominent\nplace on the wall and well cared for,\n“I see you still remember your uncle."\n“I shall never forget him.” declared\nAlice. "He was very good to me, and\nI loved him dearly.”\n"You are not like your cousins,\nthen,” said the lawyer. “Those three\nother portraits have gone to the rub\nblsh heap. So I have a special mis\nsion in coming here today.”\nAlice looked inquisitive and her hus\nband Interested.\n“By a private arrangement made\nwith myself,” explained the lawyer,\n“I was to watch the manner In which\nhis portrait was cherished by his\nnieces. To the one who showed a\ngenuine Interest in his gift, I was to\ngive, at the end of two years, the sum\nof $20,000. That legacy you have\nworthily won, and it Is now at your\ncommand.”\nAnd "those paupers" were no longer\npitied and looked down upon by the\nill-natured trio, who had lost a for\ntune by showing up their real petty\nnatures in true colors.\n(Copyright, 1914. by W. O. Chapman.)\nFolk\'s Good Opinion.\nFew persons do not value the good\nopinion of others. Bulling down the\ncharacter of someone is not the way\nto build up your own; the ruin of an\nother does not mean your building up.\nThere are some who appear to think\nanother\'s possessions something taken\nfrom themselves. This is a mistake.\nTo point out an error in another\'s\ncharacter is not to prove a correspond\ning virtue in one’s own. If we decry\nanother for being miserly, of disagree\nable disposition, extravagant or stu\npid, and expect the hearer to see the\ncorresponding virtue in ourselves,\nwe need to learn that this is not what\nthe hearer usually sees. Rather ho\nthinks how unkind such talk is and\nattention is called to failings in the\nspeaker which would probably other\nwise not have been noticed. Let your\nchief aim be to make yourself worthy\nof the good opinion of others. Belit\ntling them is a plain acknowledg\nment of a conscious fault of your own.\nThe way to win the good opinion of\nothers is to be worthy of it. if you\nare you will not need to call attention\nto it. —Milwaukee Journal.\nHabit of Judging.\nThe habit of judging is so nearly in\ncurable, and its cure is such an almost\ninterminable process, that we must*\nconcentrate ourselves for a long while\non keeping it in check, and this check\nis to bo found in kind interpretations.\nWe must come to esteem very lightly\nour sharp eye for evil, on which per\nhaps we once prided ourselves as clev\nerness. Wo must look at our talent\nfor analysis of character as a dread\nful possibility of huge uncharitable\nness. We are sure to continue to say\nclever tilings, so long as we continue\nto indulge in this analysis; and clevei\nthings are equally sure to be sharp\nand acid. We must grow to some\nthing higher and something truer than\nquickness in detecting evil.\nRunning the Gantlet.\nThe word "gantlet” in "to run the\ngantlet” is improperly used. The word\nshould be "gantlope.” Phillips, in his\n"World of Words,” tells that “to run\nthe gauntelope” is a punishment\namong soldiers, the offender having to\nrun, with his back naked, through the\nwhole regiment, and to receive a lash\nfrom a switch from every soldier. It\nis derived from Gant (Ghaut), a town\nof Flanders, where the -punishment\nwas invented, and the Dutch word lope,\nrunning.\nA Family Newspaper—lndependent in Politics—Devoted to Literature, Local and General News.\n•RQAD*\nCONSTRICTION OF A CULVERT\nConsidf rction of Economy and Safety\nDemands Employment of Other\nMaterial Than Wood.\nBy far the greater number of cul\nverts and bridges on our public roads\nhave a span ol I<>ss than fifty feet. In\nthe past these structures have, in gen\neral, been built of wood, but lumber so\nexposed in this dry climate is subject\nto rapid decay, writes Walter Graham\nin Denver Field and Farm. Conse\nquently these struct tires require a\ngreat deal of repair and. frequent re\nnewals. The ever-increasing price of\nlumber is making the further use of\nwood for tills class of structures more\nand more indefensible. The loads\nwhich our highway structures are\ncalled u|.i nto sustain are also increas\ning.

How he had hoped to wed his\npretty modest fiancee and “busk her\nfine i’ silken gown and siller ha’ to\nspare," and now “the hraw moon”\nglistened o\'er a weary city street,\nPeter penniless and hopeless, and\nJessie—lost!\nIt had come about strangely. She,\nan orphan, had left the little town\nwhere both had been born a few\nmonths in advance of Peter. She\nhad written him as agreed only once,\nto fiinii; h him with the penciled ad\ndress of the home in Chicago where\nshe had found employment as a lady\'s\nmaid. Armed with this, Peter started\nto try his own fortunes in America\nand to he near his future bride.\nFor three months in New York\nPeter wore out shoes and patience\nlooking for work. Finally he saved\n1 Ti! ,ij J|i,i!-|i!!! I\nA\nrot wm\n\\ Vrff Ur/i\nI _\nm\n™M]f\n“What Else Are Ye But a Fine\nWhistler?”\nup enough to pay his fare to Chicago,\nlie was crossing the ferry to take the\ntrain at Jersey City, when an unfor\ntunate outcast, a woman passenger,\njumped overboard in a desperate at\ntempt at suicide. Peter bravely leaped\nafter and rescued her. He was damp\nand uncomfortable the first stage of\nhis train journey. Then came the\nappalling discovery that his soaking\nin the river had blurred out the pre\ncious penciled address that was his\noniy clue to Jessie.\nThen came a month in Chicago\nwhere the inexperienced lad patrolled\nthe city streets, seeking the lady of\nhis love, to meet with bitter, utter\ndisappointment. He spent his last\ndollar advertising for her without re\nMilt He finally gave up the disheart\ncuing quest. Peter shuddered when\nhe recalled the wretched woman on\nthe ferry boat Then again, Jessie\nmight bo dead, or—wedded to anoth\ner! All Peter could do now was to\ntry and keep body and soul together\nthrough odd jobs. At home he had\nmastered the baker’s trade, but his\nspecialty lay in Scotch edibles only,\nand nobody seemed to want such fare\nat American resturants.\nNow, this especial bleak evening\nPeter was at the last extremity. He\nwas cold, sleepy, hungry. As he was\npassing a large dark building, how\never, his eye brightened. It had two\nbulletin boards at its front. Each of\nthese held a placard of some kind, in\nthe center of which, plainly visible\neven at a distance, was the counter\nfeit presentment of a huge Scotch\nthistle.\n“Certes, the sight warms the\ncockles o’ my heart!” breathed Peter\nraptly, and as he came nearer lie dis\ncovered that the placards announced\na Robert Hums birthday concert the\nfollowing evening.\n"It’s like a whiff o’ hame," contin\nued Peter “Hraw Hobby! I’m oot o’\nsich festivities at the present time,\nbut‘a man’s a man for a’ that,’an’ I’ll\ntake heart o’ cheer,” and seating him\nself on the cold stone steps Peter be\ngan to warble out cheerily, "Ye Hanks\nand Braes o’ Honny Doon.”\n“Hech, mon! but ye’re frae Dum\nbarton, 1 ken?”\nPeter jumped up to observe a\nfrowsy ancient head stuck out past a\nhalf-open door.\n"Ye hae the burr o\' the same!”\ncried Peter\n“Coom in.” invited the other, with a\ncommiserating glance over Peter, and\nhe admitted him, closed and locked\nthe door after him and led him into\nthe basement of the hall which\nseemed given over to kitchen uses\n•”\nIt contained great ranges, pots, pans,\ncrockery, barrels of flour, bags of\nsugar, in fact a culinary outfit that\nastonished the inexperienced Peter,\nThen, as lie was regarding the layout\nopen-mouthed, his host shot the\nshrewd inquiry at him:\n“What else are ye but a fine\nwhistler?”\n"A fine baker!” proclaimed Peter\nwith proud confidence—“but Scotch,\nmind ye. The trade\'s no good in this\ncountry.”\nIt took David McPherson, club\ncook, a very few minutes to turn his\nfellow countryman “inside out," as he\nexpressed it.\n“And what for ail Hits prodigious\nfood?” questioned Peter.\n"The banquet, mon,” returned\nDavid. “It\'s Hie spread after the con\ncert and tlio speechifying—the real\nenjoyment, with mountain dew adden\ndum,” and the old fellow went on to\ntell how, as the chef de cuisine in all\nthe functions of St. Andrews’ society\nhe held a lucrative and busy place.\n“I can use ye. lad, maybe perma\nnently, if ye fill the bill," ho said, and\nhe shared his supper and his bed with\nPeter, to wake up at sunrise to find\nhis guest standing patiently beside\nhim In a manifest state of suppressed\nexcitement.\n‘T’vo an Idea,” spoke Peter. ‘‘lt\nwaked me hours since,” and then with\nenthusiastic vim he developed a\nwondrous scheme that had come into\nhis mind, Scotsmen all, those at\nthe banquet might hail the novelty\nof real Scotch cooking with ardor.\n“Ther’s mutton pies, ye mind,” ex\nplained Peter. "Their mouths will\nwater for the real home-made cook\nery. And brose —no great quantify,\nbut a suggestion of the heathesy\nmoor and the childhood cot. And\nscones, and oat cakes, and short\nbread, and whole wheat Farrels, and\nMelton Mowbray pork pies!”\nPeter had set the Imagination of\nold David on fire. He was heart and\nsoul In harmony with the plan of\nsurprising the banqueters with Scotch\nfare purely. And so it came about.\nIt was a marvelous success. Upon\nthe eventful night men who saw be\nfore them the unadulterated products\nof their home soil, grew tender and\nloyal, and the hall rang with unre\nstrained enthusiasm that marked the\noccasion as glowing and grand.\nNow at the banquet was one Peter\nWilbur. And it so happened that at\nthe home of this stalwart son of\nScotia, now a prosperous business\nman, Jessie had secured employment.\nPeter’ had taken home one of the\nmutton (ties to remind his wife of old\ntimes, as he had been reminded, and\nMrs. Wilbur had given it lo Jessie.\n"I’ve noticed yo\'re longing all the\ntime,” she said to her favorite maid.\n"Maybe for home. Here’s a touch of\nit, lassie, that may solace your poor\nhomesick heart.”\nJessie took the pie and began to\npartake of it with eyes retrospective\nand tearful. A taste made her sob.\n“There was one, and one only In\nold Scotia who made the like,” she\nwailed —"my best laddie, and—oh!”\nShe burst into a scream, staring at\na criss-cross mark upon the top layer\nof crust.\n"Peter\'s mark! I know It well,” she\ntremored. “Ah! only he used that\nmark. Oh, tell me, tell me whence\ncame the pie!”\nMr. Wilbur was called and he ex\nplained. On with her bonnet, and\nJessie was flying in the direction of\nthe hall where old David had engaged\nPeter as his permanent assistant.\nShe burst in upon them unceremoni\nously. Site fell into his outstretched\narms. There were only two words\nspoken, but so fervently uttered that\nold David thrilled at their simple elo\nquence—\n“ Lassie!”\n“Laddie!”\n(Copyright, 1914, by W, O.

The mole In\nhabiting the northwestern coast is\nlarger than the common eastern spe\ncies, and a number of these have been\ncollected in order to obtain a report\non the quality of the pelt. If the tex\nture of the fur proves to be as good as\nthat of the eastern animal, there is no\nreason why trappers should not secure\na good income by capturing these ani\nmals, as the area they inhabit Is ex\ntensive. In many localities an acre\nof ground supports aa many as a hun\ndred individuals. If this little animal\ncan be profitably trapped for its fur\nthe problem of freeing agricultural\nareas from it will practically be\nsolved.\nHint for Photographers.\nCarbonate of soda is an accelerator\nfor the reducing agent.

Among these rebel\nlious skin troubles are acne, eczema,\npsoriasis and urticaria. All four dis\neases are likely to respond to treat\nment at first, but too often they return\nobstinately, as a stream of water re\nturns when it has been swept back by\na broom.\nThat common characteristic has set\nthe physicians searching for some\ncommon underlying cause. As a re\nsult of their investigations it is gen\nerally believed that there is a direct\nrelation between the metabolism—that\nis to say, the chemical changes by\nwhich food is transformed into body\ntissue—and the condition of the skin.\nHut although we accept it as a fact\nthat many kinds of skin trouble are\ndependent on the diet, it is still nec\nessary to experiment with each case\nuntil we have found the particular diet\nthat is best for it. After that has been\naccomplished there is constant need\nfor tlie patient to exercise all the self\ncontrol lie possesses, for these obsti\nnate skin disorders cannot be cured in\na few days or even a few weeks.\nA regulated diet does not mean sim\nply going without tills or adding that\narticle of food. One leading dermatol\nogist lias defined it. as “such a regula\ntion of tho quantity and quality of food\nand drink, its mode of preparation,\nand tlie lime and method of its con\nsumption as shall conduce to the res\ntoration and maintenance of the health\nof the body, including tlie skin.’’ The\npatient, therefore, must co-operate\nfaithfully with his physician or the\ncure will fail.—Youth\'s Companion.\nThe Practice of Kicking.\nKicking, like charity, should begin at\nhome. It ought to be the duty of every\nbody at home to object, persistently\nand effectively, to the specific over\ncrow d d street car, tlie badly paved\nroad, the encroaching doorstep, the\nneglected yard, tlie malodorous cess\npool, tho irresponsible motor car and\nthe reckless railroad —-especially if ha\nhave any personal part in the main\ntenance of similar abuses. If the ten\ndency of these evils were rightly ap\nprehended, if a part only of the ef\nfort that is expended, presumably, In\nobjecting to generalized, foreign and\nfutile subjects were bestowed on spe\ncific ai d tangible details, if we would\nforego the emotional pleasure of the\nimpersonal “muckrake’’ to assail the\nevil at our very feet —especially if\neach ore of us were careful to avoid\noffense in matters of the same kind —\nour country would surely be a much\nfairer i tie.—Unpopular Ueview.\nSome New Ones.\nIn a recent school examination the\nfollowing answers were given to ques\ntions asked:\nHow fast does tlie heart beat?

Such Amer\nicanisms as creek and run for small\nstreams are practically unknown In\nEngland, and the English moor is a\nstranger in the United States. The\nEnglishman is naturally but little fa\nmiliar with bayou, gulch, gully, canyon,\nbutte, divide and bluff. He knows the\nmeaning of sound (e.g. Long Island\nsound), but always uses channel In\nplace of it.\nIn the same way the American\nknows the meaning of the English bog,\nbut almost always uses swamp or\nmarsh (often elided to ma’sh). Foot\nhill is ra Americanism, so is cold\nsnap, so also are prairie, backwoods,\nflats and neck (in the sense of peninsu\nla). The Englishman seldom, if ever,\ndescribes a severe storm as a hurri\ncane, a cyclone, tornado or blizzard.\nHe does tot say that the temperature\nis 29 degrees or that the thermometer\nor the mefcury is at 29 degrees, but\nthat there are three degrees of frost.\nHe calls ice water iced water.\nIntelligence of the Beaver.\nThe life history of the beaver dis\ncloses a succession of episodes in\neach of which a reasoning faculty la\nemployed. Unlike other animals, the\nbeaver\'s intelligence consists not only\nIn doing the same things over and\nover again, but in the ability to deal\nunderstandingly with novel situations.\nCertain of its actions probably arise\nfrom the same instinct that governs\nthe rest of the lower animals, but tho\norderly sequence in which they are\nperformed leads many to believe that\nthe beaver shares with man a claim to\nreasoning faculties.', 'Fahllshcdevery Thursday at Thurmont,\nMd., by The Clarion Publishing Co.\nJ AS.

Cross pointed out\nthat the Baltimore meeting will prob\nably be one of the largest and most\nimportant conferences of the kind\never held in America, owing to the\nfact that social and charity workers\nthroughout the entire United States\nare having to face this winter, most\nserious questions in relation to the\nrelief of destitution, unemployment,\ncare of children, public sanitation\nand kindred problems, many of which\nare incident to industrial condition*\ncaused by the European war. These\nworkers, as [well as public officials\nand those private citizens who con\ntribute money and time to the sup\nport of charitable and social agencies,\nire feeling the necessity of getting to\ngether to discuss ways and m -ans\nthat the resources of the country may\nbe made to go as far as possible in\nthe alleviation and prevention of suf\nfering at home.\nOne of the most important discus\ndons thus far planned will be opened\nby Prof. Charles It. Henderson of the\nUniversity of Chicago, who will pre\nsent a report on “Outdoor Relief in\nthe United States with the Consid;r\nation of Some of the Lessons to be\nDrawn from European Experiences.”\nm\n$2,500,000 FOR FOOT-AND-MOUTH\nDISEASE. *\nUnder the recent urgent deficiency\nact which was signed by the Presi\ndent on January 25, $2,500,000 is\nnow available for the eradication of\nthe foot-and-mouth disease. Up to\nJanuary 1, 1915, the outbreak had\ncost the Federal Government a total\nof $2,129,138.01. Of this sum 81,-\n810,328.99 represents the Federal\nGovernment’s share of the expense of\nslaughtering affected herds and reim\nbursing the owners for their loss, of\nwhich the Government pays half and\nthe individual States the remainder.\nI The figures show that exclusive of\nthe work in January 101,176 animals\nhave been slaughtered. Of these 46,-\n268 were cattle, -17,735 swine, and\n.the remainder sheep and goats.\nThe money now at the disposal of\nthe department will, it is believed,\naid the campaign against the pesti\nlence by enabling the Government to\nmake prompt payment to all owners\nof infected herds, and thus minimize\nthe reluctance of farmers to have\ntheir stock slaughtered. In Illinois,\nfor example, approximately 8600,000\nis now available for this purpose. The\nloss in that State has been larger than\nin any other, 36,658 animals alto\ngether having been slaughtered.\nPennsylvania comes next with 17,896\n1 animals, and Ohio third with 10,111.\nNone of the 16 other States in which\nthere was an outbreak has lost as\nmany as B,IKK).\nIn those States in which the local\nquarantines have been rigidly enforc\ned and in which the farmers them\nselves have aided the authorities to\nstamp out the disease, satisfactory\nprogress has been made at a smaller\nexpense than was at one time feared.\nIndiana and Michigan, where the\ndisease originated, were, for example,\nat first hard hit. Much of that ter\nritory is, however, now entirely freed\nfrom quarantine and in only a small\narea is the movement of live stock\nabsolutely prohibited. In Indiana\n6,127 animals were slaughtered, and\nin Michigan 7,728.\nWhile Illinois and Pennsylvania\nare probably to-day the most serious\nly affected of all the States, there is,\nit is said, every reason to believe that\nenergetic measures will stamp out the\npestilence there as well as elsewhere.\nAlthough large quantities of stock\nhave been affected already, the num\nber up to the present is small in com\nparison with the total quantity in\nthose States. In Illinois there were\napproximately 2,500,000 head of\ncattle at the beginning of the out\nbreak. Of those 14,656 have been\nslaughtered. Out of approximately\n4,500,000 hogs only 21.587 had been\nkilled up to January 1. Of the 150,-\n000 farms in that State altout 500\nhave been involved.\nThe government built more than\ntwo thousand miles of trail and three\nthousand miles of telephone line on\nthe national forests in 1914.\n“Tl e Best Laxative I Know Of.”\n“I have sold Chamberlain’s Tablets for\nseveral years.

The membership has in\ncreased materially the past several years\nand the Sunday School numbers about\n175 teachers and scholars. It is found\ndifficult to handle the school in the church\nas it now is, and the improvements made\nwill be to relieve this congestion.\nAt this meeting it was decided to build\nin the front of the church a room 18x35\nfeet for the accommodation of the pri\nmary department and the Men’s Bible\nclass. A bellfry room 13x13 feet will be\nadded on the southeast corner of the\nbuilding. Under this new portion of the\nbuilding the heating plant will be in\nstalled.\nA new hardwood floor will be put down\nand new pews purchased. There will be\na large centre isle and an isle on either\nside of the roonl. The style of the pulpit\nand choir loft will remain about the\nsame. No carpet will be used on the\nfloor except around the pulpit, choir loft\nand isles.\nIt is planned to go to work at once;\nstone for the walls will all be hauled and\nother material secured before any thing\nis done to the present walls of the church.\nThe improvements probably will cost\n$2,500.\nFORD’S GRAND OPERA HOUSE.\nWeek of February 15th, the distin\nguished English actor, Cyril Maude, and\nhis London playhouse company in the in\nternationally successful comedy drama,\nGRUMPY,\nthe greatest and most artistic success in\nthe history of the stage.\nMr. Cyril Maude, for years one of Eng\nland’s leading character-actors, comes\nweek of February 15th, appearing for\nthe first time in Baltimore in his exquisite\nportrayal of “Grumpy,” the comedy\ndrama by Horace Hodges and T. Wigney\nPercyval, which ran all last season in\n1 New York, with phenomenal success; so\nI successful that the original plan of a few\nweeks was lengthened to a season, and\n\\ will this year include all the larger\nAmerican cities.\nI The play is a detective melodrama, in\nI which Mr. Maude plays the part of a\nI grouchy lawyer. The theft of a diamond\nI of great value in his own house rouses\nI old detective instincts and he ferrets out\n1 the criminal in four engaging acts to the\nI delight of a mystified audience. Through\nI it all, Mr. Maude makes the aged detec\n■ tive a thoroughly lovable and strikingly\nBnndividual character.\nH He is supported by a cast which is head\nby Miss Elsie Mackay, one of the most\nyoung women on the English\nwho at the age of twenty finds\nfor the first lime a leading woman.\nWednesday and Saturday.\n■ Admission 25 and 50 cents.\nEvenings 50c, 75 cents and SI.OO.\nIH Week February 22nd, Annette Keller-\nin the new musical comedy, “The\nGirl”; company of 50.\nPost Office Open Daily.\nPatrons May Secure Mail On\nSunday.\nSince the post office has been moved to\nthe Masonic Building, this place, post\nmaster Joseph C. Gernand has arranged\nto have the door to the building open\ndaily. Heretofore during his administra\ntion the office was closed on Sundays.\nA big majority of the families of this\nplace now have lock boxes, and if they\nfor some reason fail to get their mail\nSaturday evening, they can go to the\noffice any time between 8 a. m. and 8 p.\nm. Sunday and secure same. This ap\nplies only to those having the combina\ntion lock boxes. There will be no one at\nthe office to give out mail from call boxes\nor general delivery.\nIn having the door open persons at any\ntime may go into the lobby and write a\nletter, ink and pen being supplied, but no\npaper or stamps can be secured on Sun\nday. At this season the room is kept\nwell heated.\nIf any person wishes to mail a letter\nand does not have a stamp, wrap the\none or two cents for the stamp in a paper\nwith your letter and the licking will be\ndone free by employes of the office. It\nwould be wise to keep a few stamps at\nyour home, however.\nThe Sunday privilege is not supposed\nto be abused in any manner, that is, per\nsons are not sepposed to make a loafing\nplace of the post office lobby, or scatter\nlitter over the floor, but to attend strict\nly to business and leave.\nSunday last was the first day the office\nwas open to the public, and while com\nparatively few people knew of the plan\nto keep the door open on Sunday, the\npostmaster reports that an unusual\namount of mail was dropped in the letter\nbox.\nEvery call box in the office has been\ntaken and quite a few names are on the\nwaiting list. A number of lock boxes\nvet remain unsold. Get one and learn\nLhe advantages it affords.\nCircuit Court News.\nThe appeal case of Mrs. Edna Karn\nagainst George S. Huffer, which was the\nlast case on the appeal docket at this\nterm, and which was tried last Wednes\nday afternoon, was decided in favor of\nthe appellant, Mrs. Karn, when a “non\npros” was entered. The appellee, Mr.\nHuffer, had been given a judgment for\n$14.61 by Magistrate Shuff, of Emmits\nburg. Mrs. Karn’s attorneys, Reno S.\nHarp and H. S. Felton, raised the quest\nion that Mrs. Karn’s husband was liable\nfor her necessaries and that the suit\nshould have been against him and not his\nwife. A prayer was offered asking the\nCourt to instruct the jury that there was\nno legally sufficient evidence to entitle\nthe appellee to recover and also that the\nhusband was responsible for the wife’s\nnecessaries, and therefore the verdict of\nthe jury must be for the appellant. Al\nbert S. Brown was attorney for the ap\npellee.\nThe Groshon will case which has at\ntracted attention throughout the county\nwas settled Monday. The estate of Miss\nAnnie V’. Groshon was valued at $25,000\nand the will left by her did not suit many\nof her relatives.\nUnder the terms of the agreement the\nGroshon heirs, Frank, George and Mere\ndith Groshon and Mrs. Harriet V. Carey,\nreceive SII,OOO in cash to be paid out of\nthe estate. All the costs and expenses\nincident to the litigation are also to be\npaid out of the estate including the fee\nor compensation for the expert witness,\nwhich is not to exceed SIOO.\nThe commissions of the executor, Har\nry E. Carty, are also to be paid out of\nthe estate and also all debts proved\nagainst the estate of the late Annie V.\nGroshon, the testatrix. The collateral\ninheritance tax of five per cent is not to\nbe deducted from the SII,OOO.\nIt is said that the costs of the case will\namount to about $1,500; under the terms\nof the agreement the expert witnesses\nwill receive $100; the executor’s commis\nsions will amount to about $2,000; the\ndebts proved against the estate in the\nOrphans’ Court amount to about $l,lOO.\nUnder the terms of the will of Miss\nGroshon, Mrs Carey and George and\nMeredith Groshon receive $5,000 to be\ndivided among them, and Frank Davis\nGroshon was to get $5,000. However,\nthe collateral inheritance tax of 5 per\ncent was to be deducted from this.\nSee Little Buckshot at Town Hall to\nnight.\nAnti-Saloon Lecture.\nOn Sunday evening last Hon. J. Bibbs\nMills, attorney for the Anti-Saloon League\nof Maryland, gave a very interesting lec\nture in the United Brethren church, this\nplace. Mr. Mills is quite conversant with\nthe liquor problem and along with solid\nfacts was witty and held the attention of\nhis audience. In naming the states Ari\nzona, Colorado. Oregon, and Washington\nalong with others which recently voted\nthe saloon out of business, he said: “Now\ntake the first letters of the above states\nand it spells, a cow, and she went dry.\nHe also said that Thurmont was a “dry”\ntown, but it looked very suspicious when\nin passing along the street he saw a beer\nsign similar to those in Baltimore posted\non a building.\nMr. Mills returned to Baltimore Mon\nday morning.\nOwls Organize.\nThe Order of Owls organized at Thur\nmont Wednesday evening of last week.\nAfter a class was introduced into the\nmysteries of Owldom, the election of\nofficers was held, resulting as follows;\nPresident, Dr. E.

R.\nWaesche that the citizens of Thurmont\nand Graceham and immediate vicinity,\npetition the County Commissioners to\nbuild the road under the Shoemaker Road\nLaw, the said commissioners having a\nfew days previous announced that they\nwould begin building such roads in the\ncounty.\nAll present thought the suggestion a\ngood one and steps were taken to see\nwhat could be done.\nAnother meeting was called for Friday\nevening. At this meeting a hundred or\nmore substantial citizens of the two\ntowns met. Mr. J. C. Pyle of Graceham\nwas elected chairman, and Mr. Wm. 0. j\nWertenbaker secretary. The matter\nof building the road was fully discussed,\nand committees from Graceham and\nThurmont to solicit funds sufficient to\nmeet the demands of the law so far as\nthe portion of the expense borne by local\n! property owners was concerned were ap\npointed.\nThe idea advanced first was to ask that\nthe road be built between the two towns,\nbut the Graceham people insisted that\nthe road be built from the corporate lim- I\nits of Thurmont to the railroad crossing\neast of Graceham on the Rocky Ridge\nroad, a distance of one and seven-eighth\nmiles, and this was adopted.\nAt a meeting held Monday evening, the\ncommittees reported that $1,200 had been\npledged by local people. It was then de\ncided to present the petition to the com\nmissioners on Tuesday.\nMembers of the two committees and a\nlarge delegation appeared before the\n•omrmssioners Tuesday afternoon, Mr.\nJhas. C. Waters acting as spokesman\n.or the delegation, and presented facts\nwhy this piece of road should be built,\nthe principal reason being that the road\nis traveled more than any other piece of\ncounty road of like length and is in bad\ncondition.\nAs to the cost of building this road,\nthe price will be a very low one, because\nof the fact that little, if any, grading is\nnecessary between Thurmont and Grace\nham, and material for the bed is conven\nient of access and free of cost other than\nhauling.\nNo answer was given by the commis\nsioners, but to many it seems favorable\naction will be taken and the road order\ned built.\nThe Shoemaker Law provides that the\nState pay fifty, the county forty and\nabutting property owners ten per cent\nof the cost of building such roads.\nAmong those in the delegation were;\nSen.

REED.\nHave you any hens which are lay\ning soft-shelled eggs? Do you know\nwhy? Well, It is because they aren\'t\ngetting any lime to make egg shells\nout of.\nYou couldn\'t expect a mason to\nbuild a silo without cement. So you\ncan’t expect hens to put shells around\ntheir eggs without lime. They must\nhave the materials to work with be\nfore they can build eggs. Ami the\nbetter materials they are furnished,\nthe better eggs they manufacture.\nSpeaking about masons, common\nplaster makes a fairly good source of\nlime for hens. Crush it up and put it\nin a hopper, where they can get it\nwhen they need it. They will make\nvery good shells from it.\nBut the best materials for hens to\nget their lime from are shells. These\ncan be gi thered along some lake or\nriver shore and crushed by putting\nthem In a bag and breaking them up\nwith a hammer. If you desire, any\nfeeding company will supply you\nwith crushed oyster shell at a nominal\nprice.\nA soft-shelled egg is worthless, be\ncause It can\'t be shipped. Put a hop\nper in your poultry house and keep\nit filled with crushed shell. It will not\ncost much. And you will not be both\nered any more with soft-shelled eggs.\n"Fine fixlns" are the ruin of many a\ngood poultryman. Better the paid-for\nnest than luxurious furnishings. Start\nsmall and grow great.\nNever Got Through Beresford Book.\nDuring the Boxer rebellion in China\none of the missionaries was reading\nLord Charles Beresford\'s book on "The\nBreak-up of China” while the bullets\nof the Boxers were raining round.\nHe had not gone very far into the\nvolume when the pages wooed him\nto sleep. The book lay beside him on\npillow. Biff-ff-ff! came a Mann-\nHcher bullet through the window, in\na bee line for the man’s head, but\nLord Charles\' book lay in the bee line.\nThe bullet stuck in the book, but\nfailed to penetrate it.\nvenient, light and entirely satisfactory\nstructure for Wisconsin conditions. If\npossible, it should occupy an elevation {\nwith a southern or southeastern ex- |\nposure because poultry more than any j\nother class of live stock require an |\nabundance of fresh •ir and sunlight,\nand must have di quarters. Good |\ndrainage is very e. jential to a satis- j\nfactory site for a • mltry house.\nThe floor area in this and every i\ngood poultry house Is determined by\nthe si.’.e of the flock and the propor\ntion of the year during which the\nfowls are confined. In a flock of 100\nor more hens, each bird should have\nfour square feet of floor space. In\nsmaller flocks th ■ amount of floor\nspace required by each hen is relative- j\nly much greater.\nwould be considerably simplified.\n1 For the average home, chickens j\ni probably offer the easiest means of\nsatisfying the boy’s desire to work\nwith "something that\'s alive” and that\nwill pay him a little money.\nIf that youngster of yours is a bit\nrestless and lias nothing in particu\nlar to do, why not try him out with\na few hens? See if he doesn’t jump\nat the chance to supply the family\n(able with eggs and broilers at mar\nket prices. You will be surprised at\nthe amount of time which he will give\nto his “live stock" and in keeping ac\ncount of his feed bills and sales, he\nlikely w ill come to be quite a young j\nbusiness man.\nIt does not cost much to start a boy i\nin business for himself and it may\nsave you money and even more—\ni many a worry. Try it.\nHEALTH OF FLOCK\nTOLD BY DROPPINGS\nOne may know to a certainty wheth\ner or not he is feeding his liock cor\nrectly by taking a look at the drop- j\npings occasionally. In health the\ndroppings ate sufficiently hard to re\ntain their shape. They are dark in\ncolor, tinged with white. Any de- j\nparture from the normal in color and\nconsistency, indicates disease, unsani- [\ntary conditions or unsanitary food or\nwater, or that the different foods are\nnot supplied in the correct proportion.\nIf the droppings are soft and of a yel\nlowish color, it indicates that the food\nsupplied is of a too-fattening nature,\nand one should feed less of fat-produc\ning foods, such as corn, wheat, etc.,\nand correspondingly increase the\nquantity of foods rich in protein. On\nthe other hand if the droppings are\ndark and watery and contain traces\nof mucus, it plainly indicates that the\nfowls are fed an excess of foods rich\nIn protein, and the meat lit the ration\nshould be reduced. Unsanitary sur\nroundings, soured or spoiled food is\nindicated when the droppings are thin\nand of a greenish color.\n| It Pays to Keep Clean |\n| how * I\nRemove droppings frequently.

C. Coffey, chief In sheep husband\nry nt the University of Illinois, has\ncompleted liis experiments on the pro\nportion of shelled corn and alfalfa bay\nfor fattening Western lambs. The ex\npertinent also furnishes a valuable\ncomparison of the feeding and market\nqualities of wether and ewe lambs and\nshows the effects of early and late\nshearing on the feeding operations as\na whole.\nWestern lambs which had been pur\nchased on the Chicago market about a\nyear ago were used in the experiment\nThese were divided into two main\ngroups. Group one was fed the largest\nquantity of corn that it was possible\nto gel the lambs to consume, with just\nenough hay to keep them healthy and\nthriving. Group two was fed a large\namount of hay, with just enough corn\nto put them in choice market condi\ntion\nIn experiment or group one, four lots\nof wether lambs were fed as nearly as\npossible like two of the lots of wether\nj lambs. In experiment No. 2 three lots\ni of lambs were shared early and three\nwere sheared late.\nIn each experiment the lambs receiv\ning the largest proportion of corn made\nthe largest gains The difference be\ntween wether and ewe lambs in feed\ning and market qualities were slight.\nShorn lambs ate more feed than un\nshorn lambs in warm weather, but\nthere was little difference between\nthem In gains and no difference in\nmarket quality. Lambs left In the\nfleece until the end of the experiment\nsheared from 2 to 2.7a pounds per head\nj more titan early-shorn lambs, and on\nI \'bis account returned more profit.\nFeed for Weaning Colt.\nOften the pastures are short and\ndry when the young colt is weaned.\nThere Is no food so nourishing to the\nfoal as is green grass If a late pas\nture is available, the foal should have\nfree access to It.

Office of Markets, in an address\nto the Maryland State Grange,\nDec. 16. 1914.\nParcel ■ post marketing above all\nother methods necessitates a good\nproduct, because there is no Inter\nmediary through whom the identity of\nthe producer is lost and poor goods\nwill reflect directly on the producer.\nIn fact. I know it would well repay\nany community to have community\nspirit enough to build up a reputation\nfor high-grade produce, just as the\ndairymen have in many communities\nwith one or another of dairy breeds of\ncattle. This will go a long way to\nward removing the suspicion that may\nexist in the minds of the city house\nwives that farmers are always en\ndeavoring to hoodwink them in some\nway or another. New York hotter\ndealers send their representatives\nthrough the dairy districts in the West\nto bid for the output of creameries\nknown to produce butter of a high\ngrade, and a reputation for superior\nproduct is well worthy the ambition of\nany individual or community, com\nmunity preferably, because it lifts\nevery individual and proves an attrac\ntion for buyers that one Isolated in\ndividual never could prove.\nAs I have observed, there is great\nloss in marketing perishable products.\nThe more directly you can market\nyour products the more you can reduce\nthis loss ami the better returns you\ncan enjoy. We often hear the ques\ntion, "Does farming pay?” As long as\nwe leave our marketing to other peo\nple wc will have to take the prices\nthey offer. We must not *sit down,\nand wait for something to turn up;\nwe must get busy and turn something\nup for ourselves. Then ami only then,\nwill we come into our rights.\nmmm\nYou: dairy rails for pigs to patch\nout the profit of utilizing much that\nwill be wasted it you have no hogs to\neat it\nChildren Cry\nFOR FLETCHER’S\nCASTOR I A\nirS®*\nFor Infants and Children.\ni rASTORIi Mothers Know That\nSI Genuine Castoria\nALCOHOL 3 PEU centT" m\nM\'if AVcgclablcPrcpnralionforAs A1 WAVS # •\nM S similalmg the Food anil Rcijula ■ n - AVV<x J i3 M .
