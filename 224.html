Socialism was merely an in\ncldent to the general discussion. The\nonly rudeness displayed during the\nevening was by some drunken man at\nthe door, who shouted a warning to\nthe speaker. Instantly Mr. Collins\nstopped and quickly remarked that if\nthe Socialists wished to be judged\nby that kind of interference he was\nperfectly willing to let their case rest\nI with the jury of the audience.

Bitter editorials\nappear in the liberal press against the j\ncontinued neutrality of Oreece. The!\nquestion of declaration of matial law!\nwas raised in an excited session of the,\nchamber of deputies. The government j\nhas discouraged hostile comment on\nthe actions of the Germans.

Of this vast body\nof quartz eighty per cent has been\nfound to be of excellent commercial\ngrade.\nThe ledge at this point Is 1540 feet\nbelow the collar ot the shaft. The\nvalues are almost identical to those\non the level above and the ore body\ng much wider, indicative of the truth\nif the theory of the management that\nin the 1260 and 1350 west drifts, only\nhe top of the ledge was penetrated\nWhat the east and west drifts on the\n1540 will determine is lift to the im\nagination, but in the opinion of the\nwriter they will prove that the Exten\nsion Is the biggest silver mine in the\nworld, an opinion that is beginning to\nbe voiced by others.\nA very interesting development will\ntake place tomorrow or Thursday la\nthe property. It will be the hollug\nthrough from the upraise from the\n1540 into the winze from the 1350,\nboth of which workings are In contin\nuous ore.\nThe company is employing all the,\ncarpenters it can secure in Tonopah\ngetting the enlarged reduction plant\nin readiness.

It is to- be\ninferred from the knowledge at hand flint the governor and state superinten\ndent attempted to put one over on the eduoaiorn for th benefit of the ab\nsentee president of the state university in exchann for coneeion and favors\njtranred or epe-ted in return.\nIt teg evidently the plan of the state board to forre the various superin\ntendents and principals to so niodul their courses of study that graduates\nwould instantly correspond with their new environment when entering the\nuniversity.\nViewed in one light this would be ft very eommendaMe proceeding as it\nwould eliminate the necessity for preparatory work upon entering college.\nbut ft would not give the finish that every graduate from a high school should\npossess. The Bonanza does not know, cannot even approximate, the per\nrentage of high school students who continue their work through the Uni\nversity of Nevada, but it knows that it is small, lamentably small.\nA for the greater number, those who enter actively upon the duties of\nlife after they are graduated from the high school, their education should\nbe ttninhed, so far as possible, their mental equipment being not left, in the\nmiddle of the road, so to speak. It doe seem that the convention arrived at\ncompromise, which is very well indeed. It will in the future be so arranged\nthat there will be a finish given to certain branches of Instruction, enabling\nthe graduate to arrive at his Q. K. It without necessity of pursuing the de\nmonstration through a higher school, and yet, if the student elects to climb\nhigher on the ladder of knowledge, he will be so equipped as to gain en\ntrance Into the nniveTslty.\nThis compromise is naturally a victory for the superintendent and prin\ncipals, who know the conditions in lr,-ir respective towns and will be able\ntn mold their courses of study to suit the same time the interests of the\nuniversity are safeguarded.\nSCHOOL MEN MEET\nAND MAP OUT WORK\nSUPERINTENDENTS AND- PRINCt\nPALS HAVE SE39I0N WITH\nBOARD OF EDUCATION\nThe meeting, nn the wholfl, cannot\nfail to accomplish something toward!\nI he progress of tile schools of Nevnil;0\ni as it w;is evident that the body of\n\' principals and city superintendents \'.\nwas composed In its enlirety of ex.-1\nj ceptionally able, progressive, liberal,:\nup-to-date men.

There may lie intrusions and there are. There may\nbe barren zones, but the history of tin mother lode of California demonstra\ntes that beneath such occurrences the enrichment returns. Tha theory there\nIs thai of the two enrichments, one is primary and the other secondary,, one\ndue to deposition from ascending and Hie other from descending solutions.\nDeep mining In Tonopah Is likely to demonstrate wonderful things and\nprolong the life of the camp through many decades. The VA0 levej of the\nVictor, reference to which Is made elsewhere In this issue, Is almost positive\nproof that deep mining will be undertaken In this camp, for the mines are\nnot yet deep as compared with those of other long established camps.

The ore is con\ncentiated to a 50 to 55 per cent\nproduct, which is worth\' $3 pel\npound, or $(i"oU per ton. Since tin\nmill Mtarted work, Just before CliriKl\nmas, the firm has shipped 60 totu\nof concentrates, worth $:((i0,OUtl, and\nthe mill 1 working to a larger c\npacity now than at any time Blnci\nit was put in commiHHion.

Again\nIhe speaker slopitf-d to reprimand the\nprotectants, but Bpeedily resumed.\nThis halt, however, furnished the key\nnote of the evening\' most entertain\ning part of the lecture, for when Mr\nCollins asked any one in the audience\nto ask questions, a man rose and took\nexception to the alatement that\nminers\' conditions were better In To\nnopah than they were in the distant\npast.\n"1 want to say that mining condi\nlions in Tonopah are not as good a\nthey were when 1 beRan mining,\' th\nman in the audience remarked.\n"I suppose you mean Tonopah?" in\nquired Collins.\n"Yes, ! do," waa the rejoinder.\n"Then you must have made a mis\ntake In your dates. Tonopah wasn\'t\nknown twenty-seven years ago. Try\nagain. Now, my dear man, lei me leat.\nyou to what you me trying to find out.\nYou say you are a miner. I think you\nare a Socialist and that you are nm\nof those who gave me the merry ha,\nha\' a few minutes ago."\n"No, 1 am not a Socmllst," persisted\nthe questioner, but, when you say min\nIng 1ms improved, I want to tell you\nthat you don\'t know what you are\ntalking about."\n"Now, that\'s the way 1 like to hear\na man talk. Comes right out and tell\nme something that he thinks he\nluiows. nut I want to say right here\nw ti,u mntroversy is to be conduc\nted In a gentlemanly manner and 1\nwill not allow any person to Insult m\nby innuendo or directly. I treat every\none wilh courtesy and I win ins.su...\nothers giving me the same kind ol\ntreatment. This ia a delicate subject\nThis Socialist saya I don\'t know what\nI am talking about. I am going to\nconvict him out his own mouth and\nprove that he doea not know wniu ne\nIs objecting to.\n"Perhaps you will tell me when and\nwhere you began mining 27 years\nyears ago?" resumed the speaker on\ndlrert examination.\n"Oh yea. In Knglnnd. wen w are\nnot dealing with England. When did\nyou come to thin cwntryT Thirteen\nyearn ago? Thnfn fowl. Wfrn ft\n\':ng down to business. Where did you\nwork when you first came to this\ncountry?"\n"I have worked from coast to coast."\nwas the answer of the man, given\nuther reluctantly.\n"Indeed, perhaps you will be more\nexplicit. There are no mines at or\naround ISoston. 1 would like to know\nwhere you worked on the AUa.itic\ncoast." ," -\n- "I worked at Joplin,"-came the an\nswer In a (logged tone.\n"That\'s a long way from the Atlan\nIc count. Nearly as close to the Pa\nnic as the Atlantic," continued the\nspeaker. "So you came from Joplin,\nMissouri? I have been there and\n(now somelhing about Joplin. Now\nis a favor perhaps you will tell these\nleople what wages yon received in\nfoplln?"\n"I got $2.25 a day."\n"That\'s the way to come to the\nloinl," commented Mr. Collins, good\nlaturedly. Then where did you go?\nitisbee? That\'s a good town. I was\nhere yast week and know something\ntbout Itisbee. What pay did you get\nhere?"\n"I got $3.25 a shift."\n"When was that?"\n"Three years ago."\n"Then you came to Tonopah, I un\ndersland. Perhaps you will let us\nknow what your pay Is here?\'\n"1 make four dollars and a half a\nday." ,\nCollins laughed and the entirt\n\'muse joined In the roar that ensued\nThe man on the floor had been con\nvicted by his own confession and it\ndid not require the explanation of the\nlecturer to cause the majority to see\nthe point.\nImprovement in Conditions\n"My dear man if I felt like you did\na few mimtn-s ago when you gave tue.\nthe merry lia ha 1 would return the\ncompliment,\' but all 1 wish to say is\ni hat you are earning double the wages\nyou earned in. Joplin thirteen years\nago and nearly forty per cent more\nban you were paid in Bisbee, In To\nnopah you are receiving just twice\nwhat you received In Joplin. What\ndoes this mean? Doesn\'t It look as\nhough the miner\'s condition was Im\nproved. Let me give you some more\ninformal ion.\' You say the miners of\nItisbee are now making $5.20 a day?\nThat Is wrong. They Rte making $5.60\nfor miners and $5-3!i for muckers."\nThe compensation law was brought\nip to the evident delight of the ora\ntor who, it developed, was the author\nf the first compensation law intro\nluced in the United States.\n"The Nevada compensation law was\nfought by the leading Socialist in the\n-"tale, the banner bearer of your\nparty." replied Mr. Collins to another.\nwho suggested that one of the prin\ncipal planks in the Socialist platform\nwns compensation for injury and in\nlemnity on a sort of paternal plan of\n(overnmcnt. "It is well to speak of\nthose thins," continued the orator,\nbut actions are louder than words.\nNevada has made a good start and\nprobably in course of time ihe com\npensation will be increased from 50\nlo 66 2-3 per cent as t recommended in\nhe east. Grant MllleT, who was des\ncribed as an ambulance chaser, was\n(laved In a masterly manner as the\n.nly\'man who was directly interested\nIn defeating the proposed Industrial\n\'nauranre. The action of another bo\nclalist member of the legislature in\nintroducing a bill basing the competi\nsation on 60 per cent of the wages.\nwas explained aa a very clumsy at\ntemnt to defeat the industrial net\nsiuce . the legislature was willing to\naccept the 50 per -.cent indemnity and\nIt was a foregone conclusion that 60\n.ier cent or any other change in me\nbill would result In defeat"\n"What authority have you for say\ning that Socialism,- stand for- com\nmunity of prot;eit,y..interestsT\nd a man, In uiikn Oermam-\nl never give- my .opinion, of such\nuiestions, for my "opinion is not better\nhah 1hat:of arty othcV man began\n"Win la.yo.il tavorue em\nciallarHthority?\'! Then he ran over\na list- of rttian,vKrenMi and naiian\n,.mil,. of the new cult and finally in\nquired the answer from Karl Marx\nwould be acceptable.\' \' The inquirer\nassented and then, Collins seized\nn,..,nhlet from the. table and read\nrelolndor to followers of\nclallmu that the basite principle was\nthe- "bolltion of property tntereaia.\nNational AMn Sung\nTO GRANT DEMANDS\nThe lecture was a plea for unity of\npurpose and harmony of capital and\nlabor. The day of strikes is alinoat\nover, the speaker said, and all matters\nin dispute are settled around the con\nference table. Capital has been edu\ncated to the point of realizing that,\nlabor was entitled to a fair wage and\nlabor was educated to the fact that\ncapital should receive recognition as\na means of employment.\nThe subject of Socialism was\nbrought in to prove that this was file\ndisturbing element in the industrial\nsituation as the Socialists were intent\non tearing down and destroying in-.\nstead of building up, for when the\nsore was healed through the interven\ntion of conference committees, there\nwas no need for the presence of a\nPhysician, With labor and capital\nworking in harmony the Socialist and\nsoap box orator wa deprived of his\njob as a demagogue.\nWhen the Socialists say religion is\nopposed to science, the speaker re\nmarked, they were not familiar with\nthe subject, as all science was nursed\nby the church and the leading inven\ntors were men of deep Christian sen\ntiment. He cited over a score of\nnames of men whose names are link\ned w ith the most advanced Inventions\nto prove his point, and gave sketches of\ntheir sincere Christianity. In pleading\nfor harmony and the burial of bitter\nness and sectional strife, Mr. Collins\nmentioned the appointment of two\nCatholic chief Justices of the V. S.\nThe selection by Washington of Arch-j\nbiloi-Carrol oCi!altimore to nego\ntiate w ith Canada to prevent any In\nterference during the war of the re\nvolution and the action of Charles\nCarroll, of Carrollton, Md., the richest\nman in the United States, who finan\nced Washington during the trying\nlimes of Valley Korge. The last ap\npeal for the burial of hate was men\ntion of the appointment of Judge\nliramleis, the Jewish attorney of Bos\nton, to the supreme bench. This was\nthe act of a Presbyterian president.\nMr. Collins speaks this evening at\nFallon.\nIlly ANMm\'iiitiMi 1\'rvsM.I\nPATEHSON, N. J., Mar. 29.
