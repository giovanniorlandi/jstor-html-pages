E. Tobin, dele\ngate from Natchitoches. In explana\ntion of his plan Mr. Tobin said that\nhe was required to vote for submis\nsion both because of his personal be\nlief and the fact that his constituency\nis overwhelmingly fr it. "I do not\nthink the entire corltitution should\nbe killed ho ver, because one sec\ntion is unpopular," he said, "by voting\nupon it by sections ghe chances are\nthat a large part of R at least would\nbe ratified by the people." Under\nMr. Tobin\'s plan the constitution\nwould not go into effect until all of it\nhad been submitted to a vote of the\nArticles Effketive Imaddiatety."\nThe schedule committee has before\nit an ordinance which provides that as\nmuych of the new constitution as the\'\nconvention agrees upon will go into\neffect immediately wile the articles\nupon which they are at issue will be\nleft to a referendum of the voters.\ne--\nCustodian of Scool Funds.\nThe committee on education has de\ncided to incorporate in its final report\nthe schedule that parish school boards\nwould have the authority to name\nthe parish treasurer or person desig\nnated as parish treasurer to also act\nas custodian for the school funds.\nNo member of the board or employes\nwill be allowed to act as custodian.\nClerks to Get Their Salaries.\nAs a result of the action of the\njudiciary committee clerks of court\nwill be certain of receiving their sal\naries. Under existing laws, the\nclerks, with the exception of a few\nwho are still on a fee basis, receive\ntheir salaries only if their office earns\nit. A constitutional amendment in\n1916 allowed the legislature to place\nthe clerks either on a fee or salary\nbasis, and practically all of them were\nput on the salary. Under the recom\nmendations of the committee the sal\naries of these officials will be fixed\nso that they will receive them whether\ntheir office rns them or not.\nnicipal Ice Plants.\nBy a ote of 86 to 50, following a\nvery sensational debate th conven\ntion finally passed the ordi e by\nir. P of Acadia empowering\nmu alities to owi and operate\nice. factories. The ordinance reads\nas follows:\nArticle--All municipalities are em\npowered to own and operate all pub\nli utilities and ice factories within\ntheir respective limits whenever\nauthorized by a majority of the duly\nqualifi(ed taxpaye s voting at an eleec\ntion for that purpose. The legisla\nture shall pass the necessary legisla\ntion to carry this article into effect."\n-Civil Service Confirmed.\nThe fight to incorporate in the con\nstitution an article providing for civil\nservice for cities of more than 100,\n000 has been finally compromised, by\nleaving it to the legislature to pro\nVide the service under mandatory in\nStructio1ns from the convention.\nParish Government Left Alone.\nThe committee on municipal and\nParochial corporations has finally de\ncided not to take a hand in the fixing\nof parish government but to leave that\nquestion to the legislature. The fol\nlowing ordinance on the subject has\nbeen agreed to:\n"Article-The legislature may es\ntablish and organize new parishes\nWhich shall be bodies corporate with\nsuch powers as may bei prescribed by\nlaw, but no new parish shall contain\nless than 625 square miles, nor less\nthan 7000 inhais ; nor shall any\nparish be reducel ow that area or\nnumber of inha\n"Article-All \' hanging parish\nlines, or removi ish seats, shall\nbefore taking e e Submitted to\nthe electors of or parishes\'\nto be affected , at a special.\nelection held fo rpose, and the\nlines, or the pa shall remain\nunchanged un , hirds of the\ntotal vote cast lection in each\nparish affectec shall be in\nfavor thereof.\n"Article-An may be dis\nsolved and mer \' e Legislature\ninto a contigu or parishes.\nby two-thirds `o\' -lified electors\nof the parish pr~ ;be dissolved\nvoting in favor t an election\nheld for that p rovidedi, that\nthe parish or p\' which the\ndissolved par ecome\ninc\nall\nbe enlarge or territory\ncontiguous ther 11 be entitled\nto a just proportio f the property\nand assets, and be] 1t le for a just\nproportion of the. ing debts or\nliabilities of the or parishes\nfrom which sue. shall have\nbeen taken."\nTo Z\nThe committee also reported\nfavorably on an ordinance which reads\nas follows: "In th: interest of the\npeace, welfare; coitfort and happi\nness of the people,, ll.municipalities\nare authorized to zone their territory;\nto create residential, commercial and\nindustrial districts aihd to prohibit the\nestablishment of places of business in\nresidential districts."\nGood Roads Plan Approved.\nThe taxation committee has approv\ned the principles embraced in the\nSanders\' "pay-as-you-go" road ordi\nnance, also the minimum motor car\nlicense tax and the maximum, sale\ntax of two cents per gallon on gaso\nlinte, but it disapproved of the com\nprlh ory registration of motor drivers.\nLegislature to Mjet in January.\nThe legislative aepartment com\nmittee completed its schedule and filed\nits ordinance with the convention.\nThe most important new provisions\nare: Requiring the legislature to\nmeet biennially in January instead\nof in May as at present; limiting the\nintroduction of Cbills to, the first\nthirty days of a regular session, ex\n\'ept emergency measures; providing\nthat acts of the legislature shall take\neffect ten days after promulgation\ninstead of twenty, as now; requiring\nthe supervisor of public accounts to\naudit the expenditures of the legis\nlature and the publication of dis\nbursements; prohibiting members of\nthe legislature from accepting fees\nor rewards for supporting or opposing\njbills pending before it; prohibiting\nmembers of that body from trading\nvotes; creating a legislative refer\necnce bureau composed of the attor\nIney general of his assistant and one\nmember of each house, and authoriz\ning the consolidation or merging of\nstate departments, boards and com\nmissions.\nJudges Made Elective.\nThe judiciary committee has recon\nsfered its action in providing for\nthe judicial electoral college and has\ndecided to continue the present elec\ntive plan. The terms of the justices\nof he supreme court will be extended\nto Dece~pber 31 of the year in which\ntheir terms expire.\nIncreased Pay for Judges.\nJudge Gilbert L. Dupre of St. Lan\ndry. upon discovering that he judi\nciary committee plans contemplates\nan increase in the salaries of the\njudges of the district courts to $5000\nmade the the following statement to\nthe committee:\n"I am willing to pay judges $5000\nunder the new re-districting proposal.\nI am willing that they be paid when\nth.y l cater unon the discharge of\nir dut:e.. in 1924, but I am not go\nng to pay them an extra allowance\n.f $2000 pr year pending the time\n,:.(." thny aie going, to enter. upon\n:i niw dluties.

Under the existing law the\nowner is not compensated for land\ntaken for levee purposes.\nFree.

Only two weeks re\nmain, and it is very doubtful that\nthe body can dispose within that time\nof the many important subjects\npending before it, including taxation,\nsuffrage, judicial reorganization, re\ndistricting and reapportionment, civil\nservice, good roads, schools, parish\ngovernment, conservation and many\ncrs. A\n-mne of the delegate favor con\ntinuing the sessions o convention\nfor theirty days, complete the work\nal r the lines now laid down and\ntak -hances on getting pay for the\naddie al month. Others suggest\nthat the convention adjourn and leave\nto a small working committee the\ntask of drafting a short and concise\nconstitution from the material now\nin hand and meet again when the\ncommittee has completed its work.\nOthers still propose to wait until all\nschedules are in May 2, then appoint\nfrom the delegates a committee of\nsixteen, to be composed of two from\neach congressional district, to take\nall the completed schedules and sift\nthem down to organic matter and re\nport to the convention in four or\nsix months. In the meantime the\ndelegates are being delayed with\ntelegrams, letters and petitions from\nthe people throughout the state to\ncut out extravagance and keep down\ntaxes. One of these, numerously\nsigned by citizens and taxpayers of\nIberville and addressed to- the two\ndelegates from the sixth congression\nal district, reads as follows:\n"We, the citizens of Iberville par\nish, earnestly protest against the in\ncrease of any taxes and we protest\nagainst the devoting of the severance\ntax to th1 building of a monument.\n"This time our people are in sore\ndistress and are overburdened with\ntaxes. S\n"We protest against the proposed\nroad scheme. Experience teaches\nthat money paid into the state treas\nury when it comes back to the peo\npie,. is reduced fifty per cent and,\nargely the beneficiaries of f-.\n"We further protest against the\nornaments who surround the State\nBoard of Education, whom we con\nsider to a large extent political\nstikers."\nLabor Leaders Highly Paid.\nIn an gidress delivered to the Har\nvard Unimersity Liberal Club a few\ndays ago, GoveAor Allen of Kansas,\ndeclared that union labor leaders\nopposed the Kansas industrial rela\ntions court and the law behind it\nbecause they realize that if the gov\nernment may provide industrial jus\ntice "it will no longer be necessary\nfor the working man to pay out of\nhis pocket a lot of hard-faced, soft\nhanded radicals who live off of la\nbor." He said that "the business of\nsecretary of war for labor has become\na well paid profession," and quoted\nfrom a recent compilation to show\nthat "150,000 paid secretaries of la\nbor unions receive $50,000,000 a\nyear from the slender pockets of the\nlaboring men."\nJas. Hogan, a negro, convicted and\nsentenced to eight years in the peni\ntentiary for breaking and entering a\nstore at Hammond, made a murder\nous attack on Alonzo Stevens, jailer,\nat Amite City, a few days ago and es\ncaped.

Richard h\nmade a thorough investigation of\nkilling of young Amos Ourso, which\nsion plantation last week, but h "\nbeen unable to find any clue leadi\nto the identity of the person who di\nthe shooting. At first it was thought\nthe unfortuaqte youth had been ac\ncidentally" shot by his older brother,\nEldon, who was olt hunting with\nhim, but a carefuj examination of\nthe gun carrigl by Eldon showed that\nit had not been discharged in a long\ntime. Eldon told the sheriff, that at\nthe time the shot which killed his\nbrother was fired, he was five acres\naway from the scene talking to a ne\ngro wood-chopper named Joe Gar\nnett. Mr. Richard questioned Gar,\nnett and the latter confirmed the\nstatement. This the sheriff declares\nentirely dispels any suspicion which\nmight have pointed to the elder boy\nand completely exonerates him in the\nmatter. Sheriff Richard interviewed\na number of men in the neighbor\nhood. From one he learned that\nearly in the morning three or four\nboys with guns, whether they were\nwhite or black was not noticed, were\nseen going towards the woods, but\nno attention was paid to them, nor\nwere they seen again that day. Not\nwithstanding a very diligent inquiry\nSheriff Richard has been unable to\nobtain any information which would\nthrow any light on this most deplor\nable killing, which seems destined to\nremain shrouded in mysty.\nRunaway Boys Sent e.\nThursday night of last vk, Of\nficers E.

The\nfather of Platz was notified by Sheriff\nRichard by telephone and he came\nup the following day and took charge\nof his son.\nLast Tuesday night Officers Law\nless and Acosta found another strange\nlad wondering about the streets and\nplaced him in the parish hotel. He\ngave his name as Norman Lee, and\nsaid that he hailed from Rochelle,\nSheriff Richard notified the boy\'s\nmother by telephone, and at her !e\nquest he was placed on a Texas and\nPacific train Thursday with a ticket\nfor home.

AUCOIN as a candidate for\nr of Donaldsonville at the general elec\nto be held on May 7, 1921, subject to\naction of the voters.\nENCOURAGE LOCAL TRADING\n" p he Chief has been asked to call at\nS tion to the great benefit which\nould redound to the Texas and\nPacific Railway, the merchants of\nDonaldsonville and the people who re\nside in the parish of St. James on\nthe west bank o~the river, if the\neast bound pass nger train which\npasses this city at 4 p. ta., could be\nmdde to stop at St. James and\nVacherie stations. The people of St.\nJames, to a very large extent, deal\nwith the merchants of Donaldsonville.\nThe few who own automobiles find it 1\neasy with their use to come here and I\nmake their purchases, but the many\nwho do not own cars must come\nby the trains which arrives at 9:39 t\na. m., and because of the fact that the 1\n4 o\'clock train does not stop at points g\nin St. James, they must leave by the\n12:27 train, and are thus given less I\nthan three hours\' time to do their t\nshopping here. If arrangements t\ncould be made whereby the late after- g\nnoon train would stop at St. James n\nand Vacherie, thus giving visitors I\ncoming up on the 9:39 train at least\nsix hours\' time in Donaldsonville, it c\nwould greatly improve the conveni- 2\nence of the St. James\' purchasers;\nwould undoubtedly encourage and a\ngreatly increase traffic over the road f\nbetween that parish and this city b\nand result in a much greater vol- c\nume of b \' ess and trade for the S\nln al mnor fa\nFrom e standpoint of the mer\nchants tMe proposition is of sufficient\nimportance to warrant the making of\nan effort to have the train e the\nstop ioned, and from th. view\npof.~ the railroad,the increase in\ntraffic which would result would\nmore than justify the slight delays\nand inconveniences involved.\nELECTION NEXT SATURDAY.\nThe election for municipal officers\nof the town of Donaldsonville will take\nplace next Saty\'day, May 7. Three\ncommissioners are to be selected as\nfollows: Mayor and commissioner of\npublic health and public safety; com\nmissioner of finance and commissioner\nof streets and parks, and for the\nfirst time in many years there are\ntwo party tickets in the field--a\nDemocratic, with Jos. N. Gisclard as\ncandidate for mayor;Charest Thibaut\nfor commissioner of finance and D.\nOhlmeyer for commissioner of streets\nand parks, and a Republican, headed\nby K. A. Aucoin for mayor; Henry\nGoette for commissioner of finance c\nand L. J. Echeverria for commission\ner of streets and parks. The cam\npaign, considering the fact that the\ncontest is a party one, has been an C\nexceptionally quiet one. The canvass F\nthroughout has been mostly of the c\ngum-shoe style, nor are there any in\ndications that it will become more g\nstrenuous during the closing week of\nthe contest. The candidates and\ntheir friends evidently prefer to rest tc\ntheir claims to public favor upon rs\ntheir respective merits,-based upon be\ntheir past records than to engage in tr\nheated and acrimonioou discussions. he\nThere are no issues involved except th\nthat of a continuation of good gov\nernment, and this will come to pasn\nno matter which ticketis elected. 11\nonly remains for the le to decidE\nwhich of the two s f aspirant\'\nthey prefer to administe the munici.\npal affairs of Donaldsonville during\nthe next four years.
