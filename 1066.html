        <pre>['Marzec, RP. 2018. Securing the future in the anthropocene: A \ncritical analysis of the millennium ecosystem assessment scenarios. \nElem Sci Anth, 6: 42. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.294\nIn 2005 the United Nations published its Millennium \nEcosystem Assessment (MA). The MA might be best \ncharacterized as a lesser-known sibling of the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) assessment \nreports. While the IPCC assesses and synthesizes the scientific\nliterature and current data on climate change, the \nMA assesses and synthesizes the literature and data on \necosystems—analyzing ecosystem services and their connection\nto human well-being and development. The MA \nis extremely important because it provides “a scientific \nbasis for action needed to enhance the conservation and \nsustainable use of those systems” (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005a). While there have been five assessments\nof the IPCC by the time of this writing, there has \nonly been one ecosystem assessment from the MA team. \nThe report is thus the most comprehensive document \naddressing the state of planetary ecosystems produced by \nthe UN. The MA is comprised of six “Synthesis Reports” \ntargeting different audiences (scientists, business leaders, \nmembers of industry, policy makers, etc.), and the larger, \nmain “Global Assessment Reports,” which are divided \ninto three volumes. In addition to its extensive compilation\nof scientific data on the state of the planet’s ecosys-\ntems, Volume Two—Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: \n Scenarios—contains extensively modeled and imagined \nnarratives—“future scenarios”—that envision alternative\nforms of human-ecosystem interrelations unfolding \nthroughout the twenty-first century. This detailed set of \nspeculative human-ecosystem futures constitutes the \nfirst significant attempt by an international political body \nto incorporate environmental concerns into the field of \nimaginative scenario building. The kind of scenario narratives\nimagined in the MA continue to affect high-level \nwork on ecosystem management in the UN. The work of \nMA future scenario assessment has since evolved and is \nnow in the process of development by the UN Intergovernmental\nScience-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and \nEcosystem Services (IPBES). The IPBES is currently at work \non expanding the MA scenarios and is set to publish their \nfindings in 2019 (Netherlands EAA, 2016). The future scenarios\nof the MA thus stand as an inaugural exercise that \ncombines scientific data compiled by more than 1,360 \nexperts worldwide with the creative work of imagining \nand narrating potential human futures.\nThe importance of Ecosystems and Human \nWell-Being: Scenarios, volume 2 and its scenarios\nThe product of four years of work by researchers from 95 \ncountries, the MA spells out the seriously crippled state \nof planetary ecological existence. The Biodiversity Synthesis\nof the MA shows that from roughly the mid-twentieth \ncentury onwards, human agricultural practices (such as \nCOMMENTARY\nSecuring the future in the anthropocene: A critical \nanalysis of the millennium ecosystem assessment \nscenarios\nRobert P. Marzec\nThis commentary analyzes the ontological character of the United Nations’ Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment (2005) and its attempt to imagine business-as-usual and transformative human-environmental \nfutures. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) constitutes the first and most significant attempt \nby an international political body to incorporate environmental concerns into the field of imaginative \nscenario building. In addition to its lengthy report on the threatened status of planetary ecosystems, the \nMA contains extensive “future scenarios” that imagine how human-environmental relations might unfold \nover the course of the twenty-first century. These scenarios arise out of the lineage of military scenarios \ngenerated during the Cold War, and continue to inform UN assessments in the present. This commentary \nexplores how a politico-military concern for security informs the framework of the scenarios, and limits \nhow the MA characterizes the fundamental human act of narration. In the process, the commentary \nexplores alternative ontologies of narration and how these may lead to more transformative narratological \ninterventions. \nKeywords: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment; Future Scenarios; Ontology\nDept. of English, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, US\nrmarzec@purdue.edu\n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropoceneArt.\u200942, page 2 of 16  \nthe Green Revolution) and exponential encroachment on \nhabitats have led to a global loss of biodiversity. Human \ndemands for food, water, and fuel are rapidly increasing, \nand have transformed habitats more in the last 50 years \nthan throughout all of human history. Water withdrawals\nfrom rivers and lakes have doubled since 1960, and \nthe amount of water held behind dams has quadrupled. \nThe current extinction rate of species is “up to one thousand\ntimes higher than the fossil record” (Millennium \nEcosystem Assessment, 2005b). To put this in perspective,\naccording to the fossil record for “every thousand \nmammal species, less than one went extinct every millennium”\n(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b). It is \nprojected that this rate will be “ten times higher” in the \nnear future. The concern expressed in these 2005 figures \nhave, of course, only intensified. The World Wildlife Fund \nfor Nature’s (WWF) 2016 Living Planet Report, 2016: Risk \nand Resilience in a New Era reveals that between 1970 \nand 2012 planetary populations of amphibians, birds, \nfish, mammals, and reptiles declined by 58 percent (WWF, \n2016). The WWF advises that unless we act now this could \nrise to a two-thirds in the half century between 1970 and \n2020 (WWF, 2016). Along with the IPCC’s assessments on \nclimate change, the WWF report, the United Nations Convention\non Biological Diversity Conferences of the Parties \n(COPs) and the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) COPs, the MA stands as the \nmost important call in modern human history to transform\nhumanity’s relationship to the planet.\nIn addition to scientific data about the current state \nof the planet, the MA contains four future planetary \n“Scenarios”: “Global Orchestration,” “Order from Strength,” \n“Adapting Mosaic,” and “TechnoGarden.” The four scenarios\nare presented as “plausible…stories” derived from \n“real-world questions of system dynamics, policy choices, \ntechnical evolution, and consumption and production \npatterns” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). As \nprojections meant to offer “insight into uncertainties and \nthe consequences of current and possible future actions,” \nthe report’s scenarios can be described as taking on a serious\nethical commitment to the planet and its future sus-\ntainability (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). \nThe question of ethics is compounded in this situation by \nthe MA’s own admission of the new political significance \nthat must be given to ecological scenarios of this kind: \n“The quest for sustainable development has moved the \ntask of making projections about the future to the center \nof policy and scientific agendas” (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). Lest there be any question, the MA’s \nEcosystems and Human Well-Being: Current States and \nTrends, Volume 1—which comprehensively outlines the \ntroubled status of coastal systems, marine fisheries, forest\nand woodland systems, dryland systems, mountain \nsystems, and more—effectively justifies the importance \nof these scenarios. Their creation of speculative futures \nreveals in no uncertain terms how significantly we need \nto make the environment the single most important \nsocial and political challenge of our times. As I argue in \nthis commentary, the imaginative nature of the speculative\nscenarios offers pragmatic alternatives to current, \nunsustainable practices. At the same time the scenarios \ntacitly adopt forms of intelligibility that fail to consider \nthe ontological and historical character of human rationality,\nhuman subjectivity, and human storytelling—each of \nwhich are factors important to the imaginative development\nof speculative futures.\nThe MA’s tempering of the future with the \nquantitative and the qualitative, and the \nimportance of an ontological relation to \nimaginative ventures\nLike all narratives that engage in the act of future speculation,\nthe MA is a work of counterpoint. In its forays into \nthe future, it necessarily takes a leap into the unknown, \nputting to work the free-flowing, dynamic nature of the \nimagination. At the same time, it tempers these leaps with \nthe empirical data defining our present and recent historical\nmoment, mathematically modelling the factual ele-\nments that delineate current trends impacting our potential\nfor future development. In this juxtaposition of the \nknown and the unknown it seeks to overcome, as much \nas possible, the unpredictable nature of the future. This \nis accomplished by synthesizing the imaginative with the \nempirical, which the Working Group (the lead authors) of \nMA Chapter Two—“Global Scenarios in Historical Perspective”—characterize\nas follows: \nThe development of methods to blend quantitative \nand qualitative insight effectively is at the frontier \nof scenario research today. The scenario narrative \ngives voice to important qualitative factors shaping \ndevelopment such as values, behaviors, and institutions,\nproviding a broader perspective than is \npossible from mathematical modeling alone. Narrative\noffers texture, richness, and insight, while \nquantitative analysis offers structure, discipline, \nand rigor. (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n2005c) \nAs we see here two major categories define the scenarios:\nthe “quantitative” and the “qualitative.” These two are \ndefined variously elsewhere in the chapter as “numbers” \nand “words,” and as “quantitative simulation” and “qualitative\nnarrative.”  Extensions into the future are highly struc-\ntured: both “narrative” and “modelling” are mechanisms \nof future extension, but the supposedly less-assiduous act \nof narrative composition is kept in check by the rigor of \n“mathematical modelling.” The quantitative simulation of \nmodelling in scenario building thus reins in the narrativeimaginative\nmechanism of scenario building. The “future” \nis initially conceptualized in this calculative discourse \nas containing abundant uncertainty, and the modelling \naspect keeps any kind of speculation about the future \nwithin the realm of the “plausible” (Millennium Ecosystem\nAssessment, 2005c). The combination of the two \nthus addresses what the scenario building team identify \nas being the key obstacle in the development of a rationally,\nscientifically composed forms of future speculation: \n“A central challenge of the contemporary global scenario \nexercises is to unify these two aspects by blending the \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropocene Art.\u200942, page\u20093 of 16\n replicability and clarity of quantification with the richness \nof narrative” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c).\nWhat is the ontological character of “future speculation”\nin this scenario building exercise? Here, I use the \nterm “ontological” as developed by philosophers such as \nMartin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Hans-Georg Gadamer, \nand Giorgio Agamben. Reality—in terms of empirical data \nabout the physical state of existence, and in terms of past \nand present human ideas, values, behaviors, and the social \nsystems these create—is considered by Heidegger to be the \n“ontic.” The ontological, in contrast, names an act of inquiry \ninto the ways of thinking and the structural forces generating\nthe ideas and materiality of this reality. It involves \nthe rethinking of thinking itself. To put it in Gadamerian \nterms, the difference between thinking within the space \nof the ontic and thinking within the realm of the ontological\nis the difference between “explanation” and “under-\nstanding” (Gadamer, 1960). A convincing explanation is \nalways one that is logical according to an existing mode \nof thought. In this sense gathering data about the current \nstate of ecological existence is a crucial ontic activity. The \n“causes” of the current state can also be found by accessing \nthis ontic register—in the sense of measuring the effects \nof CO2 emissions, changing weather patterns, increases in \ntemperature, etc., on species and ecological interactions \nwithin specific ecosystem units. In such a way, one explains \nthe state of existence—specifically through the logic of \n“cause and effect.” However, this exercise does not exhaust \nthe “causes” of the existing ecological dilemma. The concept\nof “causes” can also be expanded to include different \nkinds of factors that extend beyond the calculable logic of \ncause and effect. “Understanding” would take us to this \ndifferent register of thought, where we can contemplate \nthe discursive, ideological, and structural formations that \nbear down upon the ontic. In such a way we might come \nto learn the potentials—and limitations—of an established \nform of reasoning, its presuppositions, and its inherent, \nself-constituting logic. In my field of postcolonial ecocriticism,\nfor instance, scholars explore the ontological varia-\ntions between different cultural-environmental relations. \nTo offer one example, Native American cultures were \ncharacterized by early European colonists as having an \nentirely inappropriate and wasteful relationship to the \nland (Cronon, 1983). Native American communal and subsistence\nagricultural relations kept them from “properly” \ntransforming and improving the landscape (Pratt, 1992). \nThis relation to the land kept them from increasing their \nagricultural yields, which meant that they could not turn \na profit. This presumed “misuse” of the land was used in \nturn to justify the European conquest of native environments\nand resources. These two very different ontological \nsystems of meaning produced two very ontically different \npolitical and environmental realities.\nThese ontological and epistemological variations \nbetween cultural-environmental systems of meaning \nleads me back to my original question: what is the ontological\ncharacter of “future speculation” in the MA scenarios? \nWe might also ask if the Working Group of authors even \nfinds ontological inquiry to be of value in its development \nof speculative futures. One might guess that the “richness \nof narrative” indicates something like an  ontological \n consideration. However, this remains to be seen. One way \nto discover this is to consider more closely the explicitly \ndeveloped interplay between the quantitative (which we \ncan clearly identify as ontic) and the qualitative (which \nalso has ontic features, since it addresses issues such as \nexisting human “values” and “behaviors”). The interplay \nbetween these two is how the Working Group identified \nthe specific developmental, creative mechanism of the \nMA narrative—that is to say, how the narrative is written, \nas we see explained above in the specific relationship \nestablished between “qualitative narrative” and “quantitative\nmodelling.” This mechanism of extending into the \nunknown future through the analysis of current conditions\n(the known) is what Heidegger and others have \nidentified as the “hermeneutic circle” (Heidegger, 1962). \nThe hermeneutic circle is a methodological problem \nnecessarily cropping up in the processes of understanding\nand meaning-making that are part of all speculative \nfields of human inquiry—humanistic, social scientific, and \nnatural scientific. Even the basic deductive formulation of \na hypothesis in a scientific lab involves the act of speculation\nsubject to circular hermeneutic thought—in which \ncase the speculative hypothesis is either shown to be false, \nor shown to be workable until the results begin to show \notherwise. The “circular” character of thought I describe \nhere refers to the unavoidable factor of backgrounded \nways of knowing, or presuppositions, that always impact \nthe generative process of meaning-making. Speculation, \nin other words, doesn’t fall out of thin air. One speculates \nbased on the ideas arising from an existing context. If an \ninquirer overlooks the influence of these ideas and presuppositions,\nthe circle is said to be a “vicious” one. The kind \nof thought that ignores its own presuppositions arises out \nof what Heidegger and contemporary “poststructuralist” \nphilosophers after him have identified as the “metaphysical\ntradition” (Heidegger, 1962). The metaphysical tradi-\ntion assumes that it is possible, and even the end-goal \nof thinking, to transform the temporality of existence \n(contingency, movement, flux, and change) into a stable, \nspatialized (motionless, and therefore easily categorized) \ngrid or field that can be controlled “meta-ta-physically”—\nthat is, from above, outside, beyond (“meta”) motile context\n(ecological, cultural, historical). Metaphysics, in other \nwords, is a mode of inquiry that attempts to replace temporality,\nand the transformations and uncertainty that \ncharacterize temporality, with a spatial representational \nmatrix that is fixed. Metaphysics is a process of “spatializing\ntemporality”—transforming fluidity and chance into a \nstatic object that can be mastered by looking down at the \nobject being investigated from above. This position above \nis assumed to give one a superior advantage, because \nfrom this higher position an investigator can supposedly \nsee  everything-at-once  (meta-ta-physika), and therefore \nobtain a complete and presuppositionless, objective, infinite,\nand not finite or limited, knowledge of a situation \n(Spanos, 1993). \nThus the metaphysical tradition, and the position \n“above temporal movement” it depends on, constitutes \nan attempt to deny the presuppositions inherent in any \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropoceneArt.\u200942, page 4 of 16  \nact of inquiry. Put differently, it would be to proceed as if \nthere were never any frameworks at work in the process of \nan investigation, never any “paradigms” to invoke Thomas \nKuhn’s term (Kuhn, 1962). Such a standpoint (which is \nactually a form of rationality that assumes one can be \nthinking from a position that is not a standpoint), would \nmake any kind of real or radical change impossible. In fact, \nHeidegger argues convincingly that such a non-standpoint\nwould make thinking about an object or situation \nof inquiry impossible: “Any interpretation which is to contribute\nto understanding, must already have understood \nwhat is to be interpreted” (Heidegger, 1962). Moreover, \n“Inquiry, as a kind of seeking, must be guided beforehand \nby what is sought,” which means that the meaning of \nwhat’s being investigated must “already be available to us \nin some way” (Heidegger, 1962). The investigator therefore\nhas some “fore-knowing” or “fore-sight” in the pro-\ncess of generating knowledge. The point, says Heidegger, \nis not to deny this fore-knowing, to deny the circularity of \nthought or to try to metaphysically transcend the circle, \nbut to “come into the [circle] in the right way” (Heidegger, \n1962). By acknowledging the contingency of thought, the \ninquirer can begin to explore the limitations of these ways \nof understanding, and subsequently how they might be \ntransformed to engender more inclusive frameworks and \nmodes of inquiry.\nThe question is whether or not the writing methodology \nof the MA scenarios—the coupling of “quantitative simulation”\nand “mathematical modelling” with “qualitative nar-\nrative” in order to provide “plausible” futures—consciously \nenters into the hermeneutic circle of thought, or whether \nit unthinkingly attempts to metaphysically transcend that \nexistential context (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n2005c). If it attempts the latter, then it would necessarily\nbe pushing forward business-as-usual solutions to our \ncurrent ecological crises. As we’ve already seen, extensions \ninto the future in the MA are highly structured: “narrative” \ncomposition is kept in check by the rigor of “mathematical \nmodelling.” The way in which the Working Group regularly \nreferences the need to be “plausible”—that is, conceivable, \nwhich is another way of saying something that will already \n“make sense” from the start, from the standpoint of the \npresent—would suggest that the type of speculation here \nis viciously circular. However, we cannot draw such a conclusion\nwithout first examining what is meant by “qualita-\ntive narrative.”\nThe ontological importance of narrative to \nimagination\nGetting a genuine sense of what the Working Group \nmeans by “narrative” in the MA is difficult. The word is \nreally never defined in the text, only associated with other \nsignifiers like “richness,” “texture,” “insight,” which are \nalso not really defined. Of course, one can say that these \nare common words that need no defining. But, as such \nsignifiers indicate, the Working Group tends to view narrative\nas if it were a kind of embroidering tool, employed \nto enhance or supplement the more essential elements \nof data and modelling. However, “narrative” is a word \nthat signifies a complex set of practices in disciplines \nthat deal directly with narratives—such as the  humanities \n disciplines of  literature, philosophy, history, sociology, \nand anthropology. \nAs Peter Brooks (1984) has shown, narrative constitutes \none of the fundamental aspects of being human. As \nBrooks points out, humans have been characterized as \nthe tool-using animal (homo faber), but they are also the \nsymbol-making animal (homo significans) (Miller, 1995). \nMaking symbols is a creative and imaginative process of \nconstituting meaning, and in this way symbol-making is \nintimately related to the act of making sense of the world \nthrough fictions. “Fiction” originally referred to two things \nhappening at once: the word comes from the Latin fingere,\nmeaning both “to make” and “to make up.” In other \nwords, language and fictive story-telling (creating and \nusing symbols) operate on the same level as tools in terms \nof their power to bring new objects and ideas into existence.\nBy extension, imagining fictions—that is, creating \nnarratives—is the first step in bringing new realities into \nexistence. The words and symbols found in narratives are \ntherefore not simply descriptive, representative tools having\na secondary status to a more empirically verifiable and \npre-existing reality; in addition to their capacity to represent\nreality, words and symbols can also constitute reality \nand, as such, they are just as material as any carpenter’s or \nengineer’s tools. In terms of the creation of ideas, different\nnarratives function like different tools for the imagi-\nnation, making it possible for new thoughts to be formed. \nThey are the life-blood and air of the imaginative mind. \nIn addition to being the practice of representing or \nrevealing reality, narrative can thus name the very different\npractices of both making (creating a reality) and \nmaking up (imagining a different reality from the one \nthat currently exists). If you abide by Aristotle’s historically\ninfluential characterization of narrative—a linear tale \nordered by a beginning, middle, and end—then your narrative\npolitics, so to speak, fall on the side of finding in \nlife, or giving to life, a dependable social structure that’s \nwell regulated and rhythmically reliable. In this sense narratives\nare essential to humans because they function as \na necessary component for developing a psychologically \nsound existence. In addition to Aristotle and many other \nphilosophers that inform literary theory, contemporary \nneuroscientists and psychologists have shown that the \ncapacity to learn how to provide structure in one’s life \nthrough the act of composing a narrative with an identifiable\nbeginning and end is a necessary component in \nthe development of healthy human memories, and thus \na healthy human mind (Van der Kolk, 2015). The ability \nto represent events in one’s memory through narrative \nis crucial, for instance, to trauma survivors who need to \ndevelop (fingere—make and make up) successful narrative \nmechanisms for overcoming traumatic injuries (Van der \nKolk, 2015). \nHowever, the repetitive rhythms of narrative can take an \nasphyxiating turn for the worse if they are adopted for different\nends. As J. Hillis Miller points out, narratives have \nbeen deployed for purposes of policing cultures and their \ncitizenry, and can be used towards the opposite of creating \nnew potentials: “Fictions keep us in line and tend to make \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropocene Art.\u200942, page\u20095 of 16\nus more like our neighbors,” and in addition to being the \n“makers of…culture,” narratives can be the “policemen of \nthat culture,” and all the more effective because they are \n“unostentatious” (Miller, 1995). Narratives repeated without\nquestion become internalized, and their manipulative \npower thereby less visible. The task of humanistic inquiry, \nparticularly in my discipline of literary and cultural studies,\nis to analyze how and why different narratives rise \nand fall in popularity over time, and how those narratives \nthat come to dominance shape culture. Different stories \nand their different characters produce different forms of \nhuman subjectivity, different human patterns of behavior, \nand different ways of thinking. Narratives thus, as Miller \nshows, “have an incalculable importance for the shape of \n[a] culture” (Miller, 1995). In the field of postcolonial ecocriticism,\nscholars explore the instrumental relationship \nthat narratives have on the brutal imperial aggrandizement\nof colonial territories and environments. Defining \ncultural narratives such as Robinson Crusoe can inform the \njustification of colonial acts of social subjugation and the \nappropriation of environmental resources. The description\nin narrative of far-flung cultures as inherently sav-\nage and inferior went a long way to justify, in the mind of \nWestern imperial authorities, the colonization of foreign \nlands, peoples, and their resources. Edward W. Said has \nrevealed the great extent to which narrative significantly \ninforms this imperial conquest of territories: “The main \nbattle in imperialism is over land, of course; but when it \ncame to who owned the land, who had the right to settle\nand work on it, who kept it going, who won it back, \nand who now plans its future—these issues were reflected, \ncontested, and even for a time decided in narrative…. The \npower to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming\nand emerging, is very important to culture and impe-\nrialism” (Said, 1993). At the same time, colonized peoples \nfind power in imagining new possibilities in and through \nnew narratives, and these in turn can then become the \nsupporting structure for postcolonial formations of freedom.\nOver the course of the second half of the twentieth \ncentury “grand narratives of emancipation and enlightenment\nmobilized people in the colonial world to rise up \nand throw off imperial subjection” (Said, 1993). These \nnarratives from the margins of predominant cultures \nand political formations of power can in turn have an \nimpact on the very centers of power: “many Europeans \nand Americans were also stirred by these stories and their \nprotagonists, and they too fought for new narratives of \nequality and human community” (Said, 1993). Narratives \ncan thus reinforce business-as-usual power dynamics but \nalso bring more emancipatory potentials into existence. \nThe point to draw from all this is that the liberatory \npotential of imagined narratives (for as should be clear by \nnow, just because a narrative is imaginative does not mean \nthat it automatically offers emancipation from the limitations\ncurrently holding sway over reality) depends on the \nfact that there is no fundamental, obligatory, or necessary \norder that pre-exists any narrativized reality. So, if narrative\nis indeed a significant element in the development \nof MA scenarios (and the Working Group certainly tells us \nthis is so), then it’s worth considering how the Working \nGroup that developed the scenarios might understand \nthat term ontologically. \nThe four MA scenarios and their relation to \nnarrative\nIn the MA, “narrative” takes on the status of a tool for \n “providing broader perspective,” and as a vehicle for \n “shaping [the] development [of] values, behaviors, and \ninstitutions” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). \nAs such we can conclude that within the text and context\nof the MA, narrative is conceptualized, in addition \nto its imaginative aspect, as a disciplinary instrument, \ndesigned—at least for the kind of scenarios that offer a \nmore sustainable future—for the development and government\nof a new sociopolitical community of people. \nThis is quite different from simply saying something like \n“narrative is the act of telling a compelling story for purposes\nof entertainment.” We are talking instead about the \npurposeful formation of a different sociopolitical human \nfuture—no inconsiderable task! “Narrative,” therefore, signifies\na purposeful formation designed to change values, \nto make them, in this case, ecologically centered: the goal \nis “to explore scenarios that include more fundamental \ntransformations of the underlying values and institutions\nof development…toward a form of global develop-\nment based on ‘sustainability first’…. This will require the \nenhancement of the role of ecosystems in both scenario \nnarrative and quantification” (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). “Narrative” therefore names the creative\nact of transformation. In and through narrative, the \nauthors are attempting to introduce an element within \nthe framework of human existence that is not a central \npart of the current polity. \nThis may be an obvious point to make of the MA, but \nthe specific ontological status of speculation, imagination,\nand narrative technique is still unclear. On the one \nhand, we can say, given the above analysis, that the MA’s \nconception of narrative as a transformative tool that brings \nnew elements within the human imaginative and social \nframework is indicative of the anti-metaphysical attempt \nto break patterns of thought that are viciously circular. \nPushing ecological concerns outside the framework of \ncivil and political existence has been a defining characteristic\nof modern human conceptual frameworks that \nchain us to the god of economic expansion, which makes \na nation’s GDP the only human value worth the effort. \nChanging that framework by substantially considering the \n“quantitative” context of the circle would certainly constitute\nan ontological, hermeneutic engagement, as defined \nby Heidegger. Yet the “qualitative” process of building a \nhuman social and political architecture genuinely heterogeneous\nto the present is more difficult to identify. To do \nthis, we need to look closely at the scenarios themselves.\nThough the four scenarios themselves never openly \nconsider the ontological status of the act of speculation\nand its artistry, they can nonetheless be read symp-\ntomatically in terms of their essential nature. Two \nof the scenarios—“Order from Strength” and “Global \nOrchestration”—are developed around “reactive” environmental\npolicies, and two—“TechnoGarden” and “Adapting \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropoceneArt.\u200942, page 6 of 16  \nMosaic”—around “proactive environmental management \npolicies” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). The \nformer two are heavily influenced by a business as usual \nschema. Both emphasize the dominating demands of a \nneoliberal economy, which is itself a form of vicious circularity\nthat places, as I indicated above, capitalism and \neconomic development metaphysically above all other \nhuman concerns. Global Orchestration offers more hope \nfor the environment. In this scenario cooperative mechanisms\nare built between nations, which means that a plan-\netary event such as climate change can be addressed by \na global body more successfully than a future in which \nnations turn inward and take up their own selfish concerns.\nOrder from Strength is built precisely on that iso-\nlationist assumption, representing a “regionalized and \nfragmented world concerned with security and protection,”\nwith regional markets within civil and political \nsociety “paying little attention to common goods,” and \ntaking an “individualistic attitude toward ecosystem management”\n(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). \nEcosystems are consequently secondary to private, economic,\nand social issues, and if they are addressed at all, it \nis out of a reactive need to negative ecological feedbacks. \nBoth Adapting Mosaic and TechnoGarden place ecological\nconcerns at the center of civil and political existence, \nthough it appears that Adapting Mosaic would have the \nmost effect on ontologically transforming civil society \n(as we’ll see shortly). TechnoGarden is more global in its \norientation. Societies act together, forming a strong international\ncommunity. Ecosystems are “highly managed” by \nlarge-scale engineering and manufactured schemes, but \nthe chance for large-scale risks due to unforeseen circumstances\nnot considered by these schemes also haunt the \nsystem. \nBoth Order from Strength and Global Orchestration \nare the closest to our own current historical occasion. In \nuncanny way, the events described in Order from Strength \nare coming to match more and more the current political\nstance of the U.S. (as I write this in 2017 we are near-\ning the end of the first year of the isolationist Trump \nAdministration). In Order from Strength, the narrative \nunfolds with one, several, or all nations turning their \nbacks on one another, “in response to global terrorism \nand the breakdown…of global cooperation” (Millennium \nEcosystem Assessment, 2005c). Militaries are strengthened\nand the economy maintains its central position in \nwealthy nations. People become suspicious of trade liberalization,\nand begin to support a domestic-oriented, \nregionalized economy. The Working Group, referencing \nprevious future scenario building initiatives, refer to this \nas “barbarization,” where the world is increasingly divided \ninto rich and poor, where the rich create a “fortress world,” \nand social systems and ecosystems eventually breakdown. \nIn the early stages of the scenario, there is indication that \nthe building of walls around nations has some positive \neffect on ecosystems, in terms of invasive species: there \nis “less expansion of invasive pests, weeds, and diseases as \nborders and trade are controlled” (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). Considering, however, that invasive \nspecies are already quite extensive around the planet, and \nthat even border controls do not end transfers of species \naround the world, this would appear to be a moot and \neven odd point for the authors to make.  \nDespite this curious lapse, the Order from Strength scenario\nconvincingly focalizes one of the key threats that \ntoday’s human rationality poses to ecosystems; that is, the \nidea that humans themselves can always and ultimately \ncontrol the environment. Such a belief, the Working \nGroup argues, leads to a “fragmented approach” to environmental\nproblems, which are only addressed when \necosystem services begin to collapse. The belief in humanity’s\nability to control ecosystems also leads to the belief \nthat natural environments themselves are not, in the final \ninstance, necessary for human survival. During the early \nyears of the scenario “everyone knew that water ultimately \ncame from nature,” but eventually people developed “the \nwidespread belief…that water cleansing could be done \nbetter by human-powered technology than by…preserved \necosystems” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). \n(Curiously, this same kind of “technofix” attitude does \nnot develop in the TechnoGarden scenario—which may \nindicate that the idea of “technology” tacitly put forward \nby the authors remains unchallenged, and subject to the \nanthropocentric view that humans are superior to nature, \nand intelligent enough to manipulate its services sustainably.)\nThis transformed view of water—an essential need \nfor all life—constitutes a significant awareness of how the \nhuman experience of physical reality can be utterly transformed\nfor the worst. In addition, in Order from Strength \nrich nations begin to solely protect their own farmers. \nFarmers in poorer countries no longer have a market for \nselling their products. They turn to harvesting nonagricultural\nraw materials (forest products, minerals, fish, and \nother wildlife) for export to rich countries, which heavily\nerodes the biodiversity of their biomes. In the “Story \nof India” section of Order from Strength, we learn that \ninternational support for poor communities from NGOs \ndisappears. As poor communities become poorer, basic \neducational skills such as reading and writing became a \nrare commodity. Joblessness, food and water scarcity, and \ndisease become rampant. The “Story of India” segment is \none of the few moments in the entire narrative where we \nread a first-person account of the situation. The unnamed \ncharacter in this story loses all the basic necessities for survival,\nand can only find refuge—in terms of food, clothing, \nand shelter—in a terrorist camp (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). \nUnlike the environmentally dystopian world of Order \nfrom Strength, the Adapting Mosaic scenario is environmentally\nproactive. As indicated in the background \nhistory for the scenarios, Adapting Mosaic is heavily \ninfluenced by the narrative of “Eco-Communalism” developed\npreviously by the Global Scenario Group overseen \nby Paul Raskin in the 2002 publication Great Transition: \nThe Promise and Lure of Times Ahead (Raskin, et al., 2002). \nIt is characterized primarily by the shift in human sensibilities\ntowards the “need to work with rather than against \nnature” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). The \nprecise origin of the idea of “eco-Communalism” is never \nexplained in either text, but one can venture to guess \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropocene Art.\u200942, page\u20097 of 16\nthat it stems from two historical sources: the anti-capital \n communalism that appears in many forms prior to and \nin the wake of the rise of capitalism (Thompson, 1993), \nand the understanding that ecosystems are constituted \nnot along artificially constructed national borders, but \nin self-constituting, regional biomes. Regardless, one key \nontological issue with this scenario stems from its lack \nof any real definition given for the term “adaptive.” Is the \nWorking Group referring to the general ecological term \n“adaptation”—as used in the current discourse about climate\nchange? Does it mean that humans are primarily the \nones to “adapt” in order to transform sociopolitical values \nand institutions into socioecological ones? Is it referring \nto humans adapting ecosystems themselves to anthropocentric\nneeds? Are we talking about adaptation in the \nDarwinian, biological sense? In the military sense (more \non this below)? Or is it some combination of all of these? \nAt times in the scenario, the essence of adapting \nappears to stem from jingoistically-formed opinions we \nsee arising today in certain national communities. For \ninstance, the kind of conservative suspicions surrounding \nthe mythical monster of “Big Government” that characterizes\ntoday’s neoliberalism seems to be a key factor in \nthe development of regional communities in Adapting \nMosaic: people become “disillusioned with the abilities of \nnational governments to govern” (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). This is the same dynamic that manifests\nitself in the Order from Strength scenario, except in \nthis case it is more local than national. However, because \nof this local forcing, management of regional ecological\nunits increases, but localities vary in terms of the \napproaches they take to the environment. The growth \nin attention and knowledge about ecological boundaries \nleads to communities developing a high capacity to cope \nwith issues that arise in specific biomes. At first this attention\nto the local leads to risks in terms of managing the \nglobal commons (since the commons are larger in scale \nand demand international cooperation). But eventually \nthese larger scale issues, interestingly combined with \nthe bottom-up orientation of Adapting Mosaic, generate\ninternational cooperative networks (Millennium \nEcosystem Assessment, 2005c). In this sense Adapting \nMosaic is the opposite of Global Orchestration, which \noperates according to a top-down structure. The risks of \nGlobal Orchestration are therefore the opposite: local \ncommunities are given no buy-in and local communities \nand ecosystems suffer because of it. Despite these pluses, \nthe Working Team finds a key drawback in this scenario \nto be its lack of focus on economic development, since \na regional focus results in less interest in international \ntrading. Most promising, however, under the Adapting \nMosaic scenario the loss of biodiversity is given the greatest\nchance of being combated. The rate of biodiversity \nloss begins to stabilize as attitudes towards biodiversity \nchange: “Whereas at the beginning of the century people\nresponded most to the loss of single, highly symbolic \nspecies, awareness now had switched to perceiving biodiversity\nnot only as an essential supporting ecosystem ser-\nvice, but as a goal in and of itself” (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). \nThis is the closest the scenarios come to opening an \nontological reconsideration of human subjectivity and its \nindissoluble relation to ecosystems (a point I will come \nback to below). But the question of human subjectivity\nultimately remains beyond the framework of even \nAdapting Mosaic, which is the most attune to local human \nexistence. One key symptom of this aporia appears in \none of the scenario’s side stories: “The Midwest Organic \nAgricultural Project.” In this side story, the Midwest farming\nscheme is launched “in October 2014…with the goal” \nin mind “of meeting the increasing domestic demand for \norganic food” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). \nThe project brings together a “national network of scientists\nand food co-ops” that bolster their efforts by gain-\ning “support from major corporations in the food sector” \n(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). The scheme \nintroduces a “detailed strategy of land use” throughout \nthe Midwest region. Science specialists design “training \ncourses for farmers,” and corporations “give market guarantees\nfor a range of products” (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). One would think that this project \nwould be a win-win situation for all involved—humans \nand nonhumans alike. But the lack of consideration of \nhuman subjectivity appears symptomatically in the contradictory\nmanner in which the project is implemented: \nthe project ultimately fails four years later and comes to \nend because individual farmers eventually return to their \nprevious farming methods. Why? Because for some reason \nin this particular attempt to generate sound regionallybased\necosystem management the lifestyles of local farm-\ners were not given any serious attention: “Unfortunately, \nthe traditional networks of farming and marketing were \noverlooked, and the farmer’s traditional decision-making \nwith respect to what to cultivate and where to sell turned \nout to be much stronger than anticipated” (Millennium \nEcosystem Assessment, 2005c). The new techniques were \nonly applied “for a limited time.” Why would this essential \ncontradiction exist in the scenario? I would suggest that \nit’s more than a lapse in the Working Group’s focus on \nthe essential “bottom-up” nature of Adapting Mosaic (for \nif this were truly a bottom-up approach, then the farmers\nwould have been consulted about the project from the \nbeginning). If we consider this at some length we begin to \nnotice that the project as designed does involve a respectful\namount of local buy-in. Training courses are devised, \nand the incentives to gain economically are given. Yet the \ncase appears to be that local farmers are somehow creatures\nwho are more “set in their ways” than the scientists \ncapable of generating new ecological schemes. Are we to \nunderstand this to be indicative of today’s existing relations\nbetween scientists and farmers? Perhaps. But if so, \nthen how is the reluctance to change understood by scientists\nand those authorized to generate scenarios like the \nones we find in the MA? \nIt would appear that the authors here have fallen into \nthe ideological belief identified by Jacques Rancière \n(2011) as the “inequality of intelligence” (Rancière, 11), or \nwhat Paulo Freire (1968) identifies in his Pedagogy of the \nOppressed as the “banking model of education” (Freire, \n2005). In short, banking education names a pedagogical \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropoceneArt.\u200942, page 8 of 16  \nparadigm that treats students as empty vessels who lack \nintelligence. In the banking model, knowledge can only \nbe given by the knowing educator who fills students as \nif they were empty banks. Rancière expands this critique \nby revealing how it normalizes a general belief in the \ninequality of intelligence, which leads to the inequity of \nauthorities speaking for and on the behalf of others. Both \ntheorists challenge the ontological ground that essentializes\nthe student-subject as ignorant and irrational, and \nin turn the teacher-subject as all-knowing and rational. \nInstead, a more equitable pedagogical encounter demands \na rethinking of this normalized student/scholar dynamic. \nAs Rancière articulates it, the path is not from ignorance \nto knowledge, but from “what [the student] already knows \nto what she does not yet know, which she can learn just \nas she has learnt the rest” (Rancière, 2011). The student \nengages actively in knowledge expansion not to ultimately\nlearn the presumed superior or correct knowledge \nof the scholar, but “to better practice the art of translating,\nof putting her experience into words, and her words \nto the test” (Rancière, 2011). In this way, the educational \nencounter is transformed from being a condescending \nwar of intelligence vs. stupidity, and into “a translation of \nintellectual adventures” from one intellectually-endowed \nsubject to the next. As such Freire and Rancière offer two \nnew kinds of subjectivity in this reconceptualized model \nof education: both student and teacher have knowledge, \nand the two interact with one another through the translation\nand exchange of knowledge from one to the other. \nThe imagined Midwest Organic Agriculture Project might \npossibly have benefited from a consideration of such ontological\nrecastings of naturalized educational processes. \nThe last scenario—TechnoGarden—is also proactive in \nterms of environmental concerns. It is based on the central \nidea that technology can transform our destructive environmental\nrelations. It couples that idea with a belief in \nmarket-oriented institutional reform. The economic element\nof this scenario differs from Global Orchestration in \nthat capitalism evolves into a concept called “natural capitalism”\n(Hawken, et al., 1999). Unlike traditional capital-\nism, which fails to see natural resources and ecosystems as \ncapital, natural capitalism organizes itself around the biological\nrealities of nature. Traditional capitalism liquidates \nnature and considers it income—thinking that nature is \nfree and inexhaustible. Natural capitalism emphasizes the \nrestoration and conservation of ecological resources. This \nis certainly a positive development, but it’s disappointing \nthat the Working Group does not consider anything but a \ncapitalist economy when attempting to imagine sustainable\nfutures. There are many pre-capitalist economic social \nformations that existed in tandem with nature throughout\nthe roughly 11,700-year length of human history, of \nwhich capitalism is little more than a strike of lightening \nin that temporal scale. Certainly, many indigenous people’s\nsustainable relations operative today, relations that \nhave very little to do with the late development in human \nhistory of privatization, would offer some functional alternatives.\nConsider, for instance, the following statement \ncharacterizing some of the specific decisions made in the \nwake of natural capitalism’s rise in TechnoGarden: \nGenerally, ecological markets are established and \nproperty rights are assigned to ecosystem services \nfollowing the identification of ecological problems. \nBecause of investment in ecological understanding \nand natural capital, problems often are identified \nbefore they become severe. Ecological markets are \nestablished at local, national, regional, and global \nscales. Depending on the social and ecological \ncontext, property rights are granted to different \nactors. (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c; \nemphasis added)\nOne could imagine a new imbalance of power developing\nas property rights undergoes an enhancement based \non ecosystem services. In a similar manner to the inequality\nof intelligence identified by Rancière and Freire in the \neducational system, natural capitalism’s environmentallycentered\nand therefore seemingly friendly alternative \nto industrial capitalism could easily result in the rise of \na new privileged elite. The “different actors” “granted” \nproperty rights would appear in the form of a combination\nof “knowledgeable engineers” and technoscientists \nand bureaucrats acquiring rights to ecosystem services, in \ntandem with corporate interests capable of supplying the \nnecessary funding for development. \nIf we seriously consider this discourse of enclosing the \necological commons based on individual property rights, \nwe will soon discover that it’s no different from the rise \nof privatized, intellectual property rights (IPRs) as developed\nby the World Trade Organization in its Agreement \non Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs). As \nthe Indian physicist, philosopher, and environmental \nactivist Vandana Shiva (1993) argues, IPRs are ontologically\nconnected to colonial history and the expansion of \nempires, which established their power through the plunder\nof natural resources in colonies around the planet. \nModern day property rights operate along the same lines. \nTransnational corporations comprise the new colonial \nactors, pirating local, indigenous ecosystem knowledge \nthat has evolved collectively throughout the history of \nvillages and communities (Shiva, 1993). Knowledge is \npatented by corporations, who then legally gain rights \nto that knowledge, putting indigenous communities in \nthe untenable position of no longer having legal rights \nto their own environments: “The TRIPs treaty…is based on \na highly restricted notion of innovation. By definition it \nis weighted in favor of transnational corporations, and \nagainst citizens in general and Third World peasants and \nforest dwellers in particular” (Shiva, 1993). Furthermore, \nIPRs also stifle our very conceptions of creativity, limiting \nit exclusively to commodification and profit: “Central to \nthe ideology of IPRs is the fallacy that people are creative \nonly if they can make profits and guarantee them through \nIPR protection. This negates the scientific creativity of \nthose not spurred by the search for profits. It negates the \ncreativity of traditional societies and the modern scientific \ncommunity, in which the free exchange of ideas is the very \ncondition for creativity, not its antithesis” (Shiva, 1993). \nPatents in this context can thus skew research towards \nthe restrictive goal of capital accumulation, which limits \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropocene Art.\u200942, page\u20099 of 16\nopen communication among scientists and communities. \nUltimately, this undermines collective creativity and pure \nscientific research. Indigenous communities find themselves,\nin the wake of an IPR act, in the odd position of hav-\ning to pay for knowledge they themselves have developed.1 \nAs indigenous postcolonial scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith \nargues, the “new global political entities being established \nunder such arrangements as the General Agreement on \nTarrifs and Trade (GATT) and other regional market zones \nmake participation within these zones dependent on certain\nsorts of compliances such as doing away with any \nprotections of local [indigenous] economies and cultures” \n(Smith, 2012). In opposition to this, argues Shiva, Smith, \nand others we might consider the idea of open, collective, \npublic rights and the potentials they offer, as opposed to \nprivate rights.2   \nDespite its orientation towards a speculative future, this \nnarrative of property rights is shaped by the familiar historical\nforces of Western imperial expansion and colonial \npossession. The privatization-for-protection and development\nsystem it tacitly proposes mirrors the kind of early \neconomic judiciary “developed to facilitate colonial patterns\npromoted by European states and their offspring, to \nthe detriment of indigenous peoples” (Anaya, 2000). As S. \nJames Anaya argues, Western legal and political systems, \nwhich were legitimated in and through the form of the \nmodern nation-state, viewed “tribal societies as not qualifying\nas nations or states and hence as without full rights \nto group autonomy or ancestral lands” (Anaya, 2000). \n“Discovery alone” by a nation-state authority constituted \nthe legal right to claim territory and resources (Anaya, \n2000). But as Anaya also points out, international law has \nincreasingly extended to include Indigenous actors, galvanized\nin part by international human rights struggles \nand reflected in bodies like the UN (Anaya, 2000). Even \nas early as 1957 the International Labor Organization \n(ILO—now an affiliate of the UN) recognized the need to \naddress indigenous rights, and the ILO Convention No. \n169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (1989) was the first \ninternational law guaranteeing the rights of Indigenous \nPeoples. 1995–2004 was named the International Decade \nof the World’s Indigenous Peoples, and the UN Permanent \nForum on Indigenous Issues was established in 2000.\nAlthough it is beyond the scope of this commentary,\nit is important to recognize the growing presence \nof Indigenous Peoples in the international arena since \nthe publication of the scenarios. Indigneous Peoples \nwork directly with the UN on matters of climate change \nadaptation and mitigation, and are seen as important \nstewards of biological diversity (IFAD, 2016; ILO, 2016; \nUNDP, 2015). The UN now directly integrates indigenous \nsustainability practices in its Convention on Biological \nDiversity’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (Palmer, 2017). \nInigenous Peoples also have a long history of working \nactively with, and being part of, international NGOs, such \nas Survival International (founded 1969), International \nRivers (founded 1985), and the International Working \nGroup for Indigenous Affairs (founded 1968) (Keck and \nSikkink, 1998; International Rivers, 2017; Dahl, 2009). \nMost importantly, Indigenous Peoples often ground their \ncommunities along ecologically sustainable lines, and \nmany are impressively resilient in the face of growing \nresource scarcity. The social-ecological histories of many \nIndigenous Peoples can thus serve as exemplary case studies\nfor authors attempting to construct ecologically viable \nfuture scenarios. The Sami communities of the Norwegian \nArctic, the Kayapo of the Brazilian Amazon, the Yoruba of \nNigeria, and the Inuit in the Arctic are just four that come \nto mind (Broderstad and Eythorsson, 2014; Zanotti, 2016; \nBerkes and Folk, 1998; Sejerson, 2004).\nGiven that a number of these integrative developments \noccurred prior to the publication of the MA, the absence \nof any real substantive consideration of Inigenous Peoples \nefforts in the MA scenarios is surprising, but only somewhat.3\nAs Svein Jentoft argues, “national governments \nhave mostly been reluctant supporters, if not vociferous \nantagonists to these developments” (Jentoft, et al., 2003). \nIn some cases Indigenous Peoples have successfully \ninvoked the Convention on Biological Diversity (1993) to \nmaintain sovereignty of resources (Jentoft, et al., 2003), \nbut most often state management regimes negatively \naffect Indigenous Peoples sustainable development and \nconservation of natural resources (Jentoft et al., 2003). \nMoreover, even “science-based resource management systems\ndesigned to save wildlife…have, for the most part, \nignored indigenous perspectives” (Nuttall, 1998). Too \noften the bottom line was a form of “material improvement”\nof the environment based on the “expectation of \nlarge profits from large projects” like mining, oil and gas \ndevelopment, hydro-electric power, or the physical incorporation\nof geographical spaces inhabited by Indigenous \nPeoples “into the nation-state through road, rail, and port \nbuilding” (Jull, 2002). \nThese profit-based forcings impact the Global \nOrchestration scenario as well. From the beginning to \nthe end, the presumably imaginative structure of Global \nOrchestration succumbs to the same deity-like invisiblemarket-hand\nlogic that forms neoliberalism and its evan-\ngelical devotion to privatization and decentralization. The \nkey symptom of this is the market-based belief that the \nwealthier you are, the more likely you’ll be able to confront\nand address all the world’s ills. The “trickle down” fea-\nture of Reaganomics and Thatcherism—the beginnings of \nneoliberalism—that gives tax breaks to the wealthy under \nthe pretense that more economic activity by the rich will \nbenefit the poor is one infamous example. The faith in \n“the wealthier you are the more likely you’ll be concerned \nabout environmental issues like climate change” is a similarly\nnoxiously conceived argument (and an unscientific \none as well, for that matter) (Dauvergne, 2016; Tamny, \n2010). If the assessments by the IPCC, NOAA, NASA, and \nsimilar organizations are correct, we know very well the \nthat wealthy have a much larger ecological footprint than \nthe poor—both in terms of poorer nations, and the poorer \nliving within rich nations. \nDespite the emphasis put on the modelling that supposedly\ntakes into account the empirical reality of 21st-century \ncivil and political society, all four scenarios lack a surprising\namount of features central to today’s world. The \nlack of these features is symptomatic of the equal lack \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropoceneArt.\u200942, page 10 of 16  \nof attention paid to the massive amount of scholarship \n available in the humanities and social sciences. There’s \nabsolutely no mention, for instance, of racism in any of the \nscenarios. Instead the world is divided between rich and \npoor nations, and the distribution of wealth and resources \nis made more equitable in most situations, except for \nOrder from Strength. There’s also absolutely no mention \nmade of the global disparity of gender relations, barring a \nminor mention of someone having to do “women’s work” \nin a sub-story embedded in Global Orchestration entitled\n“A Story of India.” The India story relates how Global \nOrchestration’s emphasis on addressing economic and \nsocial inequalities through trade liberalization and free \nmarkets leads to greater financial equality. Somehow this \nis achieved by magically “moving beyond philosophies \nsuch as the Washington consensus”—in other words, neoliberalism’s\nultimate uber-privatization and deregulation \nfulfillment. Essentially, as with Reagan and Thatcher, the \nWashington consensus elevated market fundamentalism \nto a metaphysical state—beyond any real criticism of its \nhuman-produced logic. As history now shows us, this raising\nof neoliberalism above and beyond any potential for \nfundamental reconsideration resulted in the evacuation \nof the State’s political power to address corporate control \nand to provide support for healthcare, education, the arts, \n(and now the sciences)—all of which are mechanisms that \naddress economic, intellectual, and creative inequalities. \nThis elevation of the market has increased income disparity\nboth globally and within the borders of nations, \nand formed the background for greater racial violence and \ngender discrimination. It is also never explained in the \nMA scenarios how this emphasis on the market can ever \ntransform human values in any way to make them more \nattuned to ecological concerns. The Global Orchestration \nscenario places secondary importance on the environment,\nas I mentioned earlier. Yet, the scenario appears to \nadopt the same kind of faith we see given to the “invisible \nhand of the market”: its reactive stance towards ecosystem\nservices, and its belief that “human ingenuity” will \nalways save the day, keeps it from engendering any kind \nof real transformation to human behavior and values. \nOne would think too that we would see a number of references\nto racial and gender injustice in the Order from \nStrength scenario. Yet here as well, those sizable features \nof 21st-century existence are nowhere to be found. The \nlack of any ontological consideration of these empirical \nfacts of existence indicate that future scenario building \ncould benefit from work found in fields of the humanities \nand social sciences, if future building is to escape from \nthe vicious forms of circularity that deny the relevance of \nrethinking both human subjectivity and the influence of \nneoliberalism on contemporary human-environmental \nculture. \nImagination and human subjectivity\nThe details I explore above lead me to what I would argue \nto be the most important feature lacking in the scenarios, \nand that is an ontological consideration of what it means \nto be human. The question of what it means to be human \nis one of the most central concerns of the humanities \nand social sciences. In a certain sense this absence of an \n attention to subjectivity formation is not surprising in a \ntext that takes a primarily mechanistic orientation towards \nhumanity’s future. As a number of scholars have argued \n(Chakrabarty, 2012; Eagleton, 1996; Foucault, 1980; \n Heidegger, 1962; Spanos, 1993), this lack of any ontological\nconsideration of human subjectivity (and the lack of \nontological considerations at large) is a symptom of late \ncapitalism’s economic emphasis, and its global expansion \nin the human polity since the end of the Cold War. It is \nan ideological idea perhaps best summed up by one of its \nadvocates, Francis Fukuyama, who identifies our political \nage as “the end of history” (Fukuyama, 1992). Fukuyama \nargues that human political systems have been evolving, \nand that the current Western, liberal democratic capitalist \norder is the ultimate goal of human sociopolitical development.\nIn his neo-Hegelian-informed view that “history” \nis the battle over human forms of government, he argues \nthat we have finally reached the end of that battle, and \nthus history proper.4\nWhen such a mode of thinking (which was highly \ninfluential in the building of the Washington Consensus) \nbecomes predominant, the need for ontological inquiry, \nof course, vanishes—for having reached such a point of \nperfection would suggest that the substantive critique of \nthe foundations and structures of human existence is no \nlonger necessary. While the MA certainly does not suggest\nthat such an end has been reached, it is nonetheless \ntainted by this kind of ontological lack, or aporia. The MA \nmentions repeatedly that human “values” and “behavior” \nneed to change, but there’s no real concrete sense of \nprecisely what values and behaviors need to be created \nand adopted, and no sense of how the very idea of “the \nhuman” has changed throughout history. We’re left with \nonly a vague sense that we need to adopt a more ecological\nsensibility. Here the long list of literary, historical, \nphilosophical and anthropological scholars who write \nabout the nature of human subjectivity and its transformation\nthrough the ages would be instructive (Braidotti, \n2013; Chakrabarty, 2012; Foucault, 1977; Haraway, \n2008; Hayles, 1996; Heidegger, 1962; Merchant, 1980; \nSpivak, 1987; Wolfe, 2010). The development of the cult \nof individualism, which founds itself on the ontological\nseparation of the human from ecological concerns \nwould be central to any truly transformative change in \n“values” and “behaviors.” This absence of attention to the \npotential for different forms of human subjectivity no \ndoubt explains the equally telling absence of any mention\nof indigenous peoples in the MA. This marginali-\nzation of the indigenous is a concern that haunts not \nonly future scenario building, but also other UN efforts \nto address environmental issues such as climate change. \nDespite UN efforts at recent UNFCCC COP conferences \n(especially at COP21, where indigenous peoples were \ngiven prominence in the “civil society” space of the conference),\nthere’s a serious lack of attention paid to the \nvery different environmental “values” and “behaviors” \nof indigenous peoples—from which the ecologically delinked\nWestern end-of-history Individual could learn a \nlot.5 \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropocene Art.\u200942, page\u200911 of 16\nThe MA does stand as one of the single-most important \ncalls to attend to our ecological occasion, as I mentioned \nin my opening remarks. The Scenarios Working Group \ncame to the “unanimous” conclusion that the Order \nfrom Strength scenario is “unsustainable and ultimately \ndisastrous” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). \nAs I mentioned above, we’re seeing strong elements of \nthat scenario unfolding more and more today. And the \nWorking Group does conclude the scenarios with the suggestion\nthat a “very large number of scenarios would be \nnecessary to address all possible combinations of drivers”\n(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). But \nunder the “Gaps in Our Understanding” section of the \nconclusion, the Working Group only identifies a lack in \nknowledge concerning ecosystem resilience in relation \nto human impacts, and ecosystem processes across space \nand time (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). \nThis gap is certainly a crucial one to fill, and the Working \nGroup makes a powerful case in the scenarios for institutions—which\ncurrently focus solely on economic and \nsocial issues—to incorporate ecological concerns, across \nmultiple regional and global scales of space and time. \nGiven the fact that ecosystems are the very reason the \nWorking Group generated the scenarios in the first place, \nit is equally odd that we see no mention made of any \nparticular species, or any particularly substantive discussion\nabout any specific biome in terms of its nonhuman \nelements. When a particular ecosystem is mentioned, it \nis narrated exclusively in terms of human concerns. The \ninclusion of Sub-Saharan Africa is one such example. \nInserted into the Global Orchestration scenario, we learn \nhow the decision-makers primarily governing the orchestration\nof this international community overlook local \nand rural human populations and their livelihoods. The \ngovernment of forest reserves “in Ghana’s Upper Guinea \nForest effectively displace[s] tens of thousands Akan farmers\nreliant on swidden agriculture for their subsistence” \n(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). This displacement,\nin turn, leads to increased agricultural pressure on \nareas of the forest not protected, and to frustration on the \npart of rural poor communities who subsequently disconnect\nfrom national bodies and leadership because they \nare not asked to be part of the decision-making process. \nThis is certainly an important potential development that \ncould unfold in a world where global bodies rule at the \nexpense of local regions, but it nonetheless fails to factor \nin the specific nature of flora and fauna interactions in the \necosystem itself. Again, it is odd that a report seeking to \nmake ecosystems central to human existence consistently \nmarginalizes those systems in order to concentrate solely \non anthropocentric needs. Are we to assume that only the \nhuman species has the capacity to develop differently—\nthat is, that only humans have a future, in the sense of \nchange embodied in that word?\nFor reasons of security: Why narrative lacks \nontological thought in the MA\nThis absence of a concern for imagining different forms \nof human subjectivity brings me around to the problematic\nrelation the MA takes to the (very) human activity \nof  storytelling, and back to the qualitative/ quantitative \n counterpoint I focalized in my opening. The Working\nGroup clearly believes in a fundamental difference \nbetween the qualitative/narrative/words and the quantitative\nmathematical modelling/numbers registers of \nfuture scenario building. Like any good novelist—who \ndoes extensive research on the history of her topic, who \nlooks into mounds of “data” in preparing to imagine a \nworld for her characters, who rigorously considers how \nher characters will confront and hopefully overcome these \nvery real contextual barriers of existence—the Working \nGroup authors diligently incorporate the mountainous \namounts of numbers, graphs, data, and modelling results \nthat are crucial for telling a story worthy of our consideration.\nYet the characterization of “narrative,” as we saw \nabove, would appear to be limited in terms of its relation\nto the human potential for creativity. As mentioned \nabove, we’re reminded in the “background” section of the \nMA that narrative is seen as a force that needs to be tempered\nby empirical data. I would like to trouble this seem-\ningly logical representation of storytelling.\nNarrative in the humanities and social sciences is no \neasily defined concept. As the literary critic J. Hillis Miller \nargues, narrative is ubiquitous, and appears in multiple \nforms: “As adults, we hear, read, see, and tell stories all \nday long—for example, in the newspaper, on television, in \nencounters with co-workers or family members. In a continuous\nsilent internal activity, we tell stories to ourselves \nall day long. Jokes are a form of narration. Advertising is \nanother: ‘Use this product, and then you will feel much \nbetter.’ At night we sleep, and our unconscious minds tell \nus more stories in our dreams, often exceedingly strange \nones” (Miller, 1995). Storytelling may be ongoing, and \nactive in multiple venues, but why storytelling appears \nto be so ontologically essential is not an easy question to \nanswer: “what psychological or social functions do stories\nserve? Just why do we need stories?” (Miller, 1995). \nAs Miller points out, there is an incredibly diverse set \nof theories about narrative, and that very salient fact \nstands as evidence that narrative cannot be taken lightly. \nUnfortunately, the pressures of contemporary existence \ntend to push our awareness of narrative outside the \nframework of our daily, complex lives. Social inequalities, \neconomic demands, political violence, and now ecological \ndestruction and climate change would seem to demand \nthat “reality,” not storytelling, should be our focus. The \nMA’s imperative to focus more heavily on generating \npragmatic, plausible future realities rather than unhinged \nspeculations is thus a symptom of our ecologically troubled\ntimes. Such a demand is a forcing that must surely \nimpact the ontological essence of the creative narrative \nevent, steering the imagination towards more utilitarian \nends. \nThese pressures are no doubt what informs the Working \nGroup’s understanding of “narrative.” The MA narrative \nof potential future scenarios seeks to situate a secure and \nstable (sustainable) human cultural and technological \narchitecture on top of the fluidity of (political and ecological)\nlife. This is a noble cause. But herein also lies one \nof the central ontological and ethical dilemmas peculiar \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropoceneArt.\u200942, page 12 of 16  \nto the Anthropocene.6 As has been widely and extensively \ndocumented over the course of more than three decades, \nthe anthropogenic geological forcing of the planet’s \n ecosystems is in the process of introducing increased \n ecological and human insecurity—in terms of food and \nwater security, habitat degredation, species decline and \nextinction, biome resiliency weakening, increased precipitation\nand flooding, increased drought—the list continues \nto lengthen (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; \nIPCC, 2007; IPCC, 2014). The scale of these insecurities is \nunprecedented, raising issues of human and ecological \nsecurity to the level of an existential threat. However, during\nalmost the same period of time, the concept of “secu-\nrity” has become not only one of the essential practices \nof contemporary politics, but also an “increasingly dominant\nparadigm of government in contemporary  politics” \n(Agamben, 2005). Features that previously characterized \ntotalitarian forms of government—the centralization of \npower within executive branches, the declarations of \n“states of emergency” and martial law, the suspension of \ncitizen rights, and the military measures necessary for \nimposing continual GDP growth on finite ecosystems—\nhave begun to appear increasingly in democratic societies \nand become a defining element of civil society (Agamben, \n2005; Pease 2009). This growth of security-oriented \ncultural narratives and political paradigms risks overpowering\nthe kind of alternative narrative potentials of \nsustainability and human subjectivity I referenced above. \nFor instance, since the publication of the MA and \nthe IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report the United States \nDepartment of Defense and security institutions such as \nThe Center for a New American Security have been more \nvocal about climate change and other environmental \nproblems—organizing conferences, producing colloquium \nbriefs, issuing extensive reports and strategic communication\nplans, and publishing volumes in order to coordi-\nnate “public awareness” of Anthropocene threats (Marzec, \n2015). National and international defense departments \nand security councils have begun to explicitly characterize\nclimate change as a “threat multiplier” capable of \ngenerating a more expansive war on terror (Burke and \nParthemore, 2009), and military and security institutions\nhave staged climate change war games (Tollefson, \n2008; Aton, 2017). These efforts certainly make the case \nfor Anthropocene threats, but they also attempt to steer \ncivil society towards a particular militarized understanding\nof “adaptation” (which is defined as the preparation \nfor inevitable ecological disasters to come) rather than \n“mitigation” (reducing or preventing ecological destruction).\nFor instance, during the Center for a New American \nSecurity’s 2008 Climate Change War Game, players initially\nfocused their efforts on sustainability challenges. \nHowever, players eventually found sustainability efforts to \nbe a tactically troublesome distraction from national and \ninternational security: “A focus on cutting greenhouse gas \nemissions runs the risk of crowding out full consideration \nof adaptation challenges” (Burke and Parthemore, 2009). \nIn the wake of this concern, game players refocused their \nattention on security measures rather than sustainability. \nThis concentration on national and international security \nis certainly not surprising, given the source. Nonetheless, \nthis  focalization on a militarized conception of security \nis now part of a larger cultural momentum, one that has \nbecome a  central and defining existential component of \nhuman life (Bonneuil and Fressoz, 2016). If efforts centered \non imagining new forms of sustainability pose a threat to \nsecurity demands, one can imagine how the imaginative \nwork of generating speculative sustainable futures may \neventually be deemed a potential security risk. Security is, \nof course, of paramount importance if we are to confront \nthe growing loss of habitats and biodiversity, and address \nthe equally serious issues of food and water security. Yet, \nas with narrative, there are different forms of security and \ndifferent ontological reasons for imagining how security \nsystems will unfold and be deployed. \nThese larger ontological features of security form part \nof the background of the MA scenarios. This is especially \nnoticeable in the Order from Strength scenario, with \nits focus on tribalism and regional conflict. But as the \nWorking Group also informs us in its background explanatory\nsections, the kind of scenario building influencing \nconceptions of security in the MA have their history in the \ndiscipline of “future studies” as conceived during the first \ndecades of the Cold War by the U.S. Department of Defense \nand defense contractors such as the RAND corporation: \n“Scenario analysis has its roots in the strategic planning \nexercises and war games devised in the early years of the \ncold war” (Raskin, 2005). We are told too that the “direct \nantecedent” of the scenarios is the “second wave” in scenario\ndevelopment, which began with corporate scenario \nplanning in the 1970s (Raskin, 2005). The fact that a military\nand a corporate genealogy form the declared lineage \nof the scenarios is by no means a tributary matter. The \ncorporate “second wave” of future studies as established \nin this politico-scientific genealogy is presented as a major \ndevelopment, a new epistemological direction. However, \ncorporate and military fields have been intertwined since \nthe beginning of capitalism, as Manuel De Landa reveals \nat great length in his War in the Age of Intelligent Machines \n(1991). That is, ontologically speaking, they are of the \nsame essence. In fact, as Frederick Taylor himself pointed \nout over a hundred years ago in his seminal Principles of \nScientific Management (1911) the impetus for his great \nassembly line idea came from observing military camps \nand their maneuvers and drills. This general diffusion \nof a militarized focus on security across a larger cultural \nspectrum—what I have termed elsewhere “environmentality”—has\nbeen gradually developing over the course of \nthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Marzec, 2015).7 \nWe must ask ourselves what might happen if security \nbecomes the fundamental basis of narrative, or even the \nreigning feature of imagination itself. \nElements of this kind of militarized security appear most \nheavily in the MA’s Order from Strength scenario, but the \nother scenarios also place similar emphases on security \nin one form or another. In TechnoGarden the forcing of \na global economy around sustainable technologies sees a \nnumber of “unelected technocrats” affiliated with corporations\nand NGOs come to power (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). The “increased enforcement of global \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropocene Art.\u200942, page\u200913 of 16\nenvironmental and civil regulations by technocrats lead \nto an intense series of ‘police and national building’ wars” \n(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005c). Ecological \nprojects are “backed by military force,” and in order for \nthe entire global system to function properly, these kinds \nof security measures are emphasized as a basic necessity \nof human existence (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n2005c). “Global Orchestration” places similar emphases \non national and international security when the solutions\nimposed by large-scale technological solutions and \nglobal economic orders generate unforeseen “ecological\nsurprises” in the form of infectious diseases, fisheries \ncollapse, aquafer depletion, etc. (Millennium Ecosystem \nAssessment, 2005c). The heavyhanded control necessary \nfor Global Orchestration cannot handle the kind of “crossscale\necological feedbacks” that arise from such a rigidly \nsecuritized system (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n2005c). Even the Adapting Mosaic scenario—the most \nflexible system—sees military conflict unavoidable in certain\nregions of the world. \nNarrative and transformation\nAs we have seen, the MA Working Group grounds “future \nstudies” as a discipline in the militarized mentality of the \nCold War (the “first wave”) and early neoliberal development\n(the “second wave”). But there is a much culturally \nbroader and historically extensive literary canon of futureoriented\nworks that is worrisomely absent from this dis-\nciplinary framework. There is, for instance, no mention \nof the field of utopian studies, a discipline comprised by \nworks that attempt to construct sustainable and egalitarian\nforms of existence. These works are part of a lengthy \nliterary canon of future studies: Plato’s Republic, Euhemerus’s\nparadise island in Sacred History, Christine de Pizan’s \nwomen’s utopian city in The Book of the City of Ladies, \nThomas More’s Utopia, Tommaso Campenella’s The City of \nthe Sun, Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Rabelais’s Gargantua\nand Pantagruel, W. H. Hudson’s  A Crystal Age, Edward \nBellamy’s Looking Backward, William Morris’s News from \nNowhere, B. F. Skinner’s Walden Two, Ernest Callenbach’s \nEcotopia, and dozens more. Instead the authors establish \na framework of narratives that place more importance on \nnational security and the economy. \nAs I mentioned briefly above, narrative in the humanities\nis understood to involve acts of both order-making \nand order-giving (Miller, 1995). As Terry Eagleton has \nargued, narrative—and literature in general—is part of the \npolitical “way we organize our social life together, and the \npower-relations which this involves” (Eagleton, 1996). In \nthis sense, storytelling helps address the need to provide \nsometimes lengthy, sometimes momentary forms of stability.\nWe can also understand these forms of stability in \nterms of maintaining a healthy and productive sense of \nsecurity. There are certainly many narratives that make \nthis kind of healthy securitizing their prime directive. \nOther types of narratives, however, warn us of what can \nhappen when security becomes a predominant political \nparadigm, and an essential rationale for existence in all its \nrebellious variety. Almost all the works I listed just above \nwould fall into this category. They reveal the limitations \nand oftentimes violence of human manufactured systems \nof security. As such they serve as a doorway to the ontological—to,\nthat is, an awareness and subsequent critique \nof the distinguishing way things are. This enables us to \nrethink the concepts humans have created, the values they \nhold, and the behaviors they have adopted (the ontic). \nIn the speculative fictions of narrative, humans learn, \nto return to Miller, to “experiment with possible selves” \n(Miller, 1995). We learn what places have been made available\nfor humans to occupy—what humanist theorists refer \nto as “subject positions” (Hall, 1997).  A human subject \nis never a metaphysically free-floating, disinterestedlythinking,\ncontext-less being (despite the fact that some \nthrough history have attempted to constitute humans in \nprecisely this fashion—the colonial landlord presenting \nhimself as innately superior to his colonized subject is one \nexample). Cultural and historical contexts create subject \npositions for us. These positions are not merely secondary \nconstructs hiding a more fundamental Self. They are the \npositions in and from which we come to live, think, hope, \nand dream. This means that these positions influence \nand sometimes even govern how we think and act, and \nhow we develop our individualized (and frequently massproduced)\nidentifications with the world. Because these \npositions are constructs, this means that they are not, as \nwith any manufactured entity, absolutely and unquestionably\nbinding. In these positions humans come to be what \nthey are, but the essence of what it means to be human \nchanges from one historical epoch to the next, from one \nculture to the next. The most insightful speculative narratives\nopen the potential to fundamentally rethink the \nnature of the world and the subject positions given to \nhumans. Such insight requires that we let go of those \nthings that make us feel most secure. \nWe should not be surprised that environmental concerns\nwere beyond the horizon of these first two waves of \nscenario building as defined by the MA Working Group. \nFor introducing the environment into modern cultural \nand political systems of human power is a rebellious act, \none that calls for a fundamental transformation in how \nhumans constitute their sense of human existence in the \nworld. The philosopher and political and literary critic \nJacques Rancière offers us a felicitous description of the \nkind of rebellious narratives that refuse to reproduce the \nsubject positions we’ve been naturalized to accept out of \nhand. He characterizes a truly ethical and political act as a \nnarrative that makes “the part of no part” appear (Rancière, \n1999). The “part of no part” is not simply a marginalized \nconstituency that already exists. The phrase names a \npotential form of subjectivity that has yet to exist—precisely\nbecause of an imbalance of power in the sociopo-\nlitical system. Furthermore, the part of no part begins to \nmake its appearance in and through the speculative space \nof narrative—which can be an act of speech, or an act of \nwriting. In this sense, the potential for transformation is \nfirst made possible in the realm of narrative. The part of no \npart, according to Rancière, “names a fundamental wrong” \nin its act of drawing attention to the imbalances of power. \nThe significant point to draw from this is that narrative—\nfiction—names the space in and through which we can \n', 'Marzec: Securing the future in the anthropoceneArt.\u200942, page 14 of 16  \nbegin the process of creating a different empirical reality. \nThe MA scenarios, in part, offer this kind of ontological \ncritique of current systems, and they in turn offer future \nsystems that have the potential for reorganizing the state \nof human and nonhuman existence. But in neglecting \nthe nature of human subjectivity, and in foregrounding \nthe need for security without ontologically thinking the \nvery essence of security in the Anthropocene era, they \nend up reinforcing current neoliberal subject formations \nand structures. Only through the creation of new forms of \nsubjectivity can we generate new conceptions of politics, \nsociality, and ethics. Such new forms would, in turn, bring \nwith them new contexts for recreating behaviors and values\nthat speak to that immense but increasingly impov-\nerished ecological element of existence that globally \ndominant human societies and their many apparatuses of \neconomic and political development have thus far given \nlittle or no part.\nNotes\n 1 For details see Josephine Axt, M.

Three \nof these references occur in the  TechnoGarden scenario,\nwhich sees the elimination of “huge  numbers” \nof Indigenous Peoples. The fourth reference occurs in \nAdapting Mosaic, which sees an Indigenous effort turn \nto “tragedy” because of a lack of large-scale, national \ninfluence.
