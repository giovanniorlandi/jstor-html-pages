The three bottles of 1789\nbrandy sold in Paris a day or two ago\nfor $16 a bottle by no means provide\nan absolute record in point of age. In\nhalf a dozen London hotels anyone\nmay obtain century old liqueur brandy.\nAt the Hotel Cecil guests may drink\n"Boulestin" of the year 1800, while\ncomparatively youthful brandy which\nhas only spent 75 years in the same\nbottle seems quite cheap in compari\nson. The senior brandy at the Savoy is\nentering its second century, for it\ndates bad: to Trafalgar year 1805.\nIt costs $20 a bottle. Two varieties of\n1808 brandy may also be obtained.\nYet these brandies ar3 in their cal\nlow youth compared with some vener\nable spirits in the cellars of some old\nFrench families brandies which are\nover 150 years old and only see the\nlight once in a decade, at weddings\nand similar epoch making events.\nCitizenship-\nIf you claim citizenship rights and\nare not on the rolls or have business\nbefore the Interior Department, write\nimmediately to W.

Of course the object\'was to ad\nvertise the Buster Brown Blue Ribbon\nand other brands of Brown\'s shoes,\nbut the well known character of\nBuster and Tige lost none of their\ndrawing features for that. Although\nthe reception was primarily for chil\ndren, long before the hour grown folks\nas well began to gather and by 3:30 p.\nm. there was a large crowd gathered.\nAs soon as the schools closed the\nchildren lost no time in getting in\nevidence and for an hour .South Wil\nson street was literally packed with\nmen, women and children, J,all trying\nto get a good view of Buster in cos\ntume and Tige comically dressed with\nhat and spectacles, calmly sitting in a\nchair smoking a pipe. With the dis\ntribution of souvenir buttons the\ncrowd became uncontrollable and\nmany were caught in the crush For\ntunately no one was seriously hurt.\nNick and Alice\nMarried Today\nWedding Service Witnessed by the Most\nBrilliant and Distinguished Assem\nblage Ever in the White House\nAssociated Press\nWashington, Feb. 17 In the beautiful white and gold east room of the\nWhite House, a few minutes after noon today Rt. Rev. Henry Y. Saterlee,\nbishop of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of Washington, pronounced the\nfateful words which united in marriage Alice Lee Roosevelt and Nicholas\nLongworth. The simple, beautiful, impressive ring service of the Episcopal\nchurch was given, attended by all the beauty of a cathedral service, and was\nwitnessed by one of the most brilliant and distinguished assemblages that\never gathered in the White House by far the largest company ever in the\nICRS.

The floral decorations were more\nelaborate than any heretofore seen in the historic room during the Roosevelt\nadministration. j\nNuptial music from "Lohengrin" was rendered as the bride entered the\nroom leatjing on the arm of her father, preceded by members of the family.\nThe bride earrled a bouquet of gardnahes "\'id lilies of the valley from the\nWhite House conservatory. Her only attondant was her sister, Miss Ethel.\nThere was no floral bower, as waa at first suggested, but a temporary al\ntar was placed at one end of the east room, where Mr. Longworth and his\nbest man, Thomas N. Perkins, awaited the bride.\nUshers separated as they readied the platform and the president passed\nthrough the two lines, ascended the platform and taking his daughter\'s hand\nplaced it in that of the bridegroom. An instant later the groom placed the\nring upon the finger of her left hand and Alice Lee Roosevelt became Mrs.\nNicholas Longworth.\nAt the close of the brief ceremony the orchestra played Mendelssohn\'s\nwedding march. Immediately after congratulations, the wedding breakfast\nwas served in the state dining-room, during the service of which there was a\nmiscellaneous orchestra concert.\nThis evening the happy couple will depart for the Southland on their\nbridal tour The trip will be made in a new Pullman car, named "Republic."\nThe car is 10x80 feet, a greater length by 20 feet than the average sleeping\ncar. It is luxuriously fitted up and contains every modern device for the\ncomfort and convenience of the travelers.\nThe itinerary includes Roswell, Georgia, and a slow journey through\nthe southern states.\nThe White House grounds have been closed throughout the day and none\nexcept those who held invitations were permitted to enter. The executive\nollices were also closed.\nFor several vears, In fact so long\nthat it has become one of the regular\nweekly routine events about the edi\ntorial room of the Chieftain on Satur\nday mornings is the gathering of the\nministers of the city to leave copy for\ntheir Sunday announcements. To\ncome in conl act with these cultured\nand well informed men even though\nfor a brief moment once a week is a\nprivilege the editor always welcomes.\nDuring the lifteen years the writer has\noccupied the place of ditor of the\nChieftain many clergymen have come\nand gone and not one is remembered\nthat did not stand for the highest and\nbest citizenship. Take out of the so\ncial fabric of Vinita her church life\nled by her preachers and it would be\na poor place in which to live.\nMay they be sustained as become\nour splendid people and may their in\nfluence never wane.\nMRS.\nThe Mother\nLONGWORTH.\nof Congressman Long-worth.\nCLOTHING DEPARTMENT\nWe Are Introducing Spring Styles\nMAY CANCEL\nGAS LEASES\nllartlesville, I.

Scandal Is a canker that rots out the soul.\nWhat editors do In avoiding scandal a private cit izen\nshould do. Life is full of regrets, but no human being\never in his life has cause to regret that he stopped his\ncars to tale bearers, that he refused to believe nine of ten\nevil reports. .No town can be cleaner than the mouths\nand hearts of its citizens, "State Capital.\nCome and get the\nBest Values\nTHERE IS NO MONEY IN MINTING- SCANOALS\nThe saying that a newspaper must, print what its\npatrons wish to read Is often used by o\nfor scandal items which should never h\nthe columns of their papers. Seldom\ns as an excuse\nhad a place in\nnecessary for\nI influence of\nI the better\na paper to give publicity to such affairs, the\nwhich is bad morally, for I he majority and\nclass of t he readers find them repungant.\nWilliam Allen White, the Kansas author and editor\nwas right when he said\' "There Is no money in scandals,\nand every honest editor prints its little of it as he can.\nThose papers which pay best print the least ill reports:\nfor the class of readers, such newspapers reach, are so\nmuch better than the scandal-lovers that advertisers will\npay higher advert ising rates to them. As a general rule\nthe man who stops to read scandals is a loafer and has\nno money to spend for goods which merchants are adver\ntising. There are, of course, exceptions and there are\nitems of news of a scandalous nature winch are so im\nportant that everyone must read them to know the facts.\nBut such items are the rare exceptions to the general\nrule. Once in live years is often enough for a news\npaper to give the sickening details of a crime against the\nsocial order. In the west the papers are particularly\ndecent. The western Dapcrs are cleaner than the east-\n1LL CHOSEN TEUMS,\nSenator Halle\', of Texas, makes a fine point in politi\ncal ethics and brings a severe arraignment against the\nrepublican party and against the president in the follow\ning excerpt from a recent speech:\n"I do not complain that the president adopts a policy\nfor which we are entitled to credit as the author, even\nII\' we are to give him credit as the linisher. Hut I have\na right to comment, and I will comment, upon the fact\nthat it lias seldom happened In the political history of\ntills country that one part y goes to tin count ry demand\ning a change, while another party goes to the country\n\'standing pat\' I do not know just exactly what that\nexpression means, but 1 am told t hat it is borrowed from\na game of chance, as that, other expression about which\nwe hear so much a \'square deal.\' I am told that Is the\nvernacular of the same place. Think of it ! This great\nrepublican party, which for so many years boasted of its\ngreat moral ideas, now appealing to the people of this\ncountry in the vernacular of the gambling room ! One\nparty goes to the country standing pat against another\nwhich demands a change; the country decides in favor of\nthe party whicli stood pat, and then the president chosen\nby that stand-pat party proposes to deal at once. A\nsquare deal,. It is true, but the party in power said, \'We\nstand pat;\' and I am informed by gentlemen who are fa\nmiliar with the game that that means there is no further\ndeal, square or otherwise."\nHome Made\nHave your cake, muffins, and tea bis\ncuit home-made.

Of the latter\nthis nest is about the only one left in\nthe stale.\n"The cemetery near the town is an\nIndex of the character of the place.\nThe few tombstones contain only the\nnames of the departed, with the date\nof death and sometimes the age. Not\na line of sentiment Is carved upon a\nsingle atone.\n"I was curious to know why. A\npatriarch undertook to enlighten me.\n" \'This town,\' he said, \'is no Hall ot\nFame. Leastwise not. yet. The com\nmunity has been fooled so often that\nwe don\'t take up with anything new\nat first sight.\n" \'We got wise after tribulation. I\ndoubt if you could find a man in the\ntown who, if he told you the truth, haa\nnot eaten injo something hollow since\nhe has been here. For awhile it\naeemed as if this was the camping\nplace of every fraud and skin game on\nthe road.\n" \'After a long run of this sort of\nihlng the community finally got sus\npicious of itself. Then a few of the\nleaders organized a sort of testing com\nmittee. One of the tenets of this com\nmittee was to say no:iiing about a\nman\'s virtues, if he ha 1 any, unU.\nhe had been dead a year.\n" \'Several men who had cut a con\nsiderable figure in their livts died an l\nreceived a lot of notices alout what\nthey had done. We found out later\nit hat they had been morally rotten and\nrascally on the sly.\n" \'Now. when a man dies is thl-\n\' community, especially one who posed\nj to the good, the committee meets and\nj the question is asked: "Was the de-\nceased what he cracked himself up to\nbe? If anyone present can prove that\nhe was we simply record that he died\nand then wait a year to see if any\nthing turns up against him If he\nrings out all right we hold another\nmeeting and the deceased gets what is\n, coming to any good man.\n" \'By that time the monument fever\nhas cooled down and one good dead\nman is on a level with another. Be\nsides, this sort of thing saves money.\n" \'If the dead man\'s family wants to\nput up a monument and smear it over\nwith a lot of Scripture, thafa their\nbusiness. Btu there isn\'t a monument\nof that kind in our graveyard. If we\nlearn anything against the decease,\nafter he has been buried a year we\naay nothing, but we are very partic\nular in any business transactions we\nmay have with his immediate kyi for\never after.\'\n"I asked the old man if he believed\nthat the community was anv hot- for\nFor the\nLeast Money\nat the\nNew Tint ml\nE.
