IU double value comes from its be\ning on two jobs at the same time. It\nis working for the investor that is,\nfor the man who buys it and at the\neame time it is working for Uncle\nSam\'s army across the seas and help\ning to win the war. While it is feed-\ning and clothing and putting rifles in,\nthe hands of American riflemen it is\nworking for the man who bought it. j\ni The bond that remains in the in-.\nTester\'s hands is backed by all the re-i\neources of the national government.)\nThat means that all the wealth of the\nUnited States, whether it be in the\ncoil or the waters, in, on or under the\nearth, or in the hands of the owner of\npersonal property, la pledged to the\ninvestor as security fSr the money\nthat he has loaned the government on\nthat government\'s solemn promise to\nPay.\nI They Are Fighting Dollars.\nAt the same time the monkey invest\ned in Liberty Bonds is buying steel\nJacketed, five-to-the-clip cartridges for\nthe fighting man in Lorraine, Picardy\nOr Flanders it is paying the owner\n4 per -cent Interest ! \'\nAn th hankers ooint out. aurelv this\nIs not\' much of a sacrifice on the part -1\ncf the buyer who is asked to help his j 1\nnation and at the same time is given, f\nZZteTt meTinrwo,\n..i..t! om. ,k...J\nof its history, has never repudiated a\n0ebt\n: A government bond comes nearer\nfilling the unique position of lettnr\':\nDOUBLE DUn\nOWNERS A\nthe investor spend his money aia !.\nkeep it at the same time than any oth- j ;\ner means of getting rid of the actual;;; st.

This 13 about the war\nsituation today.\nThe Hun came to Belgium and\nnorthern- France, devastated the\ncountry, burned the homes, kill\ned the men ravished the women,\nand starved and crucified the\nchildren. And he did wilfully\nand feloniously take, steal and\ncarry away all the personal\nproperty that he could lay hands.\nupon: he laid tribute on the\ncities and towns; he led away\ncaptive and into slavery such of\nthe ablebodied men as offered no\nresistance to his destruction of\ntheir homes arid added to these\nmany thousands of women.\nNow, that he has staggered,\nstumbled, yes, almost fallen, he\ncries out, "Peace," and at the\nsame time sets fire to the cities,\ntowns and villages, and even the\npeasant houses, he is forced to\nleave.\nmore man iwo mimon Ameri\ncan soldiers are now on foreign\nsoil. They have gone there with\nthe one idea of bringing a lasting\npeace to the world. They have\nnot yet accomplished that task,\nbut they are on their way.\nWhen these boys left home for\nthe army camps, their slogan\nwas, "To Berlin or burst," and\nfrom that day to this they have\nsteadily faced in that direction.\nSome have been killed, many\nnr it a. mi; :\nmore have been wounded, but\nnever a whine, never a turning\naway from the task they .have\nundertaken. Millions of letters\nhave come back from across the\nsea. Do they want to come\nhome? Certainly, but not one\nhas expressed a desire to quit be\nfore the job is finished. On the\ncontrary they want to fight, and\nfight and keep , on fighting.\nThey are not even willing to\nleave the battlefield when wound\ned, and they often run away\nfrom the hospitals and sometimes\nthey reach the front when too\nweak to carry a gun. Would\nyou stay their hands before\nvictory crowns their efforts?\nThe spirit of the boys over\nthere is faithfully portrayed in\nthe following excerpt from a\nletter to his mother written, by\nLieut. R. E. Spivy. of Car ti,z,\nHiss\nafter he had been in j\nbattle nineteen days on a stretch:\n"Then the chase began, and\nfor the next 18 days we chased\nthe kaiser\'s best, chased them\nover 15 miles, and still had them\ngoing, when we were relieved in\norder that we might get a little\nsleep and rest up. I never slept\nover four hours per night and\nmany nights did not sleep at all.\nNever slept from Sunday night\nuntil Wednesday night, and then\nI was out in one of the hardest\nrainstorms I ever saw wet to\nthe skin. I slept about four\nhours, and never even caught a\ncold. One meal a day was a\nluxury.\n"But every one was happy,\nhappy in the thought that they\nwere fighting, and fighting a\nwinning fight for God, country\nand home. The spirit of the\nAmerican soldier is the most\nwonderful sight of all. To daunt\nhim is an impossibility; you can\nnot work him too hard; and with\nhis faith in God he fears nothing;\nwith death and destruction on\nall sides of him, and he can\nlaugh at it all. Laugh because\nhe knows he is right, and that\nwhatever the cost, the reward is\nworth it. He has made, his\npeace with Gol, and is here to\ndeliver the goods. He is not-doing\nhis \'bit-,\' but pvcry day,\nevery hour, he is doing his \'all.\'\n"\'The bravest battle that was\never fought,\nShall 1 tell you where and\nwhen?\nOn the maps of the world, you\'!\nfind it not;\n\'Twas fought by the mother\',\nof men.\n" \'Nay, not, with cannon or bat\ntie shot,\nWith sword or nobler pen.\nXT l 1 - 1\ni ay, noc wicn eloquent word or\nthought,\nFrom the mouths of wonderfu\nmen.\n"\'But deep ,iri the walled up\nwoman\'s heart,\nUt women who would not\nyield, -\nBut bravely, silently bore her\nparts,\nLo! there is the battlefield.\'\nIhe above conveys to you\nmy only trouble, my only worry\nI know that each of you is wor\nrying aoout me, and my prayer\ntoday is that you cease your\nworrying, i am taking my\nchance, \'tis true, but it is\nso small a chance, and if\nshould happen to be called, think\nwhat acall it would be, think of\nthe victory, the personal victory\nthat would be won.\n\'I know you have fought your\nsilent battles, from babyhood to\nthe grave, and that you hate to\nsee me go out, alter an your\nyears of toiling, struggling with\nme, to take my chance upon the\nfield of battle. But, dear ones,\nmy prayer today is. give me a\nthousand deaths upon the fields\nof France, but God deliver me\nfrom the coward\'s heart which\nwould make me stay at home,\nYou have filled my veins with a\nblood which will not allow me to\ndo less than my best; you have\nfilled my soul with a spirit which\nwill not allow me to stay behind\nand see others play my game,\nYes, blood and spirit which\ncause me to glory in the God\ngiven privilege of helping de\nstroy the greatest menace to\nGod and to man the world has\never known. So, on I go, with\nGod as my guide and home my\ndestination. Some day I will\ncome back to you, but only after\nmy duty has been done. It may\nbe hard on you, but no greater\nlife can be- lived, no grander\ndeath died.\n"All that I am looking for is\npeace and the end of war, and\nthen home. When I come back\nto you I want to come back just\nas I left you. I want no bell-\nringing, band-playing welcome.\nThe Ameriean army wants no\nhonors, for for every honor that\nis showered upon U3 who return\nwe realize that the price is our\nbrothers who have gone to their\neternal sleep beneath the sod of\nFrance.

I must, in\nmy first account of the war,\nmake an attempt to impress up\non you, and beg that you scatter\nthe same all over the land, the\nvital i mportance of an absolute\nbacking of the army at home.\nWe know you are with, us, but\nhere and there a man is found\nwho is against us; he is gather\ning personal benefits, and we are\npaying the price. Every time a\nman does one little thing against\nthe furthering of the ;.wai an\nAmerican boy\'? life is the price.\nIf you had teen what I have\nlived you would, along with\nevery soul in the land, give . up\neverything you have, and live in\nthe woods, if necessary, to en\nable the army to drive this war\nto an early end. The man who\nputs self above his country, who\nthink3 of profit and gain rather\nthan service is worse than the\nblackest spy in the German\narmy. It is up to you who are\nwith us, body, soul and heart to\nclean out that\'class of reptiles in\nAmerica just as If they were a\naen oi rattlesnakes, we know\nthat your are with us, and rt al\nize that your fight is the hardest,\nbut all together, without a hitch,\nwe can soon bring an end -to it\nail; t .\n"We are fighting with a re\nnewed vigor and determination,\ni i iti i m\nior we Know tne oreea ot so-\ncalled humans whom wejmust\nstamp out, and, again, we have\nthe work of our fallen comrades\nto complete, and so,\' .with\'\nhigher purpose, with a greater\nfaith and with a song in our\nhearts and a smile up on our\nlips, we are driving, driving, day\nand night, straight into -the\nheart of Germany."\nAgain we ask, would you stay\ntheir hands? Indeed not. This\nis no time to talk peace. The\nwar is not nearly over. Now is\nthe time to strike, and strike\nhard. The German "Pgace\noltensive must be met with\nbond offensive.
