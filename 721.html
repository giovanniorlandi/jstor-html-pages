He was here ami\nbeen ted to be glad of It?these heroes\nof one of the most notable war* ever ;\nwag? d?survivors of one of the grand- j\n??et armies ever marshalled on a battle j\nlaid. They wore here on cratches,\'\npeg-legs and canes. Armkss sleeves\nand seais and limp* remind us that\nthe aim of the enemies bullets did not\nalways miss their mark. However, if\nthere existed in the minds of any of\nthese old hat?!*? seared vetrans a\nregret for the part they played lu the\nbloody drama < f the 60s\', such regret\nwas not visible 01 audible en Tuesday. \'\nOn the other hand, they were proud\nof their record. They bore conspicuos-1\nly yet modes? ly the honors which they \'\nhad wun in their country\'s defence. If!\nthere was an -Old Vet" here on last \'\nTueeday who was ashamed of his j\nrecord as a Confederate Soldier, he did \'\nnot let it be known.\nA sumptous and bountiful banquet \'\nhad been prepared by the good women j\nof the town. At 12 o\'clock the doors I\nWere thrown open, and the old soldiers \'\nand their guesfs filed in under com?\nmand of Col. H. C. Alderson, Comman-1\ndant of the Brown-Harman Camp.\nThey sat down to a dinner in striking\ncontrast with many a one they had\nhad in other days. The guests were\nho prouder nor happier than their\nhostesses, the fair maidens and ma?\ntrons who served?the finest specimens\nof the noble womanhood of the South\n?some of whom, in years gone by had\nwept and rejoiced over sons and hus?\nbands they gave to the Cause and\nCountry, of which they were such\nImportant factors.

Nannie Alexander, Nellie\nGeorge and May Kelly. Messrs\nHankitiH & S^n donated for\nthe occasion a large phonograph,\nand Mr. Clyde Banklns played\nthe old songs, march?s and Dixie, and\nthe old soldiers lived over again the\ndays when they bivouaced at Gettys?\nburg, Petersburg and Seven Pinee.Bull\nRun and Appomattox, and felt proud\nIn the fact that tney had bourne their\npart in these and other great struggles\nfor freedom and right.\nThe day ended.

Then? are plenty\nof people who think that the saloon\nbusiness could not possibly be reform\'\n\'??I. that is, made respectable under say\ncircumstances. This is an extreme\nview, and it never paj ato take extreme\npositlonB on any question. The truth\ngeneral!; Uea between extremes. The\nAnti-Saloon League has accomplished\ngreat things by its careful avoids nee\no? extreme measures. Certain reforma\nm the conduct of the saloon business\nsrci possible anil practicable, which if\nadoptad would go far towards remov?\ning the odium attached tothebuahv\nHere are a few plain suggestions:\nThe Liquor D?niera Aseocintloa\n? uld have a hlgbei standard of\nmorality and qualifications for those\nwho engage in the business. As in all\nother vo,;itjo, so in this, there ere\nmen of no ehnractcr or principle at the\nhead of the business, who have do\nregard for decency, There nie nota\nlii. exceptions, and where tl\nexceptions are found the busina\nconsidered in adlfferenl light. The\ncharge has been frequently made thai\nthere are so gentlemen 01 honest men\nin the bnaineae. This ?^ extreme and\nfanatical, it is true, howerer, that\nthe saloon bUaShesa has in it far too\nuiany men who are unscrupulous, and\nWhose soie object seems to be to get\ntill they ? an at whnl *A, A\n"reform" is needed and practical here.\nAgain ?r it is desirable to remove^the\nodium ifpoaalble, it would help matters\nconsiderahly to refuse to allow crowda\nto assemble in bar rooms. One of the\nchief aoureea of danger, ilsapiaoe and\nclime attending the sale of HquOl Is\ndue to the si/.e as well as the character\nla allowed to congregate\nthere. All colors and oharactera\ncrowd In, treat and tank up, until often\nthe saloon is a veritable bedlam*\nNoise, oaths, pistols and lights are\noften the result. Quiet, temperate\nmen, who feel the need, perhaps, of ?\nstimulant, and who tan control them\nselves, shun these bar rooms often\nbecause they do not care or are afraid\nto, mix up with the crowds they will\nfind there. iso business can ev? r\nbe made respectable oj *\'reformed" in\nwhich ladies cannot engage or fre?\nquent, and until the character of the\ncrcwds which congregate in saloons\nare materially altered and reformed\nthe business will lack a long way of\nbeing as respectable as a large num?\nber of people no think it might be\nThe law now prohibits women anil\nChildren from going into saloons.\nPool tables and bar rooms should be\nseparated. The two seem to go to?\ngether. From the bar to the pool\ntable and back again is a short dis?\ntance. Between the two money is\nwasted, and worse than wasted.\n?oiing men are influenced and enticed,\nand here often start on the road that\nleads to ruin and the account is charg?\ned up to the saloon.\nPlease understand: We are uot\ncontending that the saloon business\ncan, might, could, would or should\never become entirely respectable, in\nthe usual acceptance of the term.
