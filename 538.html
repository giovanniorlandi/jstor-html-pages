Oxford, Lafayette County, Miss., Thursday, July 27, 1922. Jfa. 3*.\nUNIVERSITY TO BE\nREADYSEPT. 20\nFive Dormitories Already Completed;\nContracts Let For Other Work.\nConstruction work at the Univer\nsity of Mississippi is going forward\nrapidly and it is expected that every\nthing will be in readiness for the\nopening, September 20. Five, com\nmodious, new dormitories have been\ncompleted, making it possible for the\nUniversity to accommodate a great\nly increased attendance. The mag\nnificent Chemistry and Pharmacy\nBuilding has assumed a finished ap\npearance from the outside and plans\nfor equipping the laboratories and\nclassrooms in the best and most\nmodern way have been made. Im\nmense steam tunnels nave been cut\nto connect the new buildings with\nthe Power Plant, which is to be\nthoroughly overhauled and furnish\ned with larger engines and boilers.\nThe contract for this .work has al\nready been given as has that for the\nremodeling of the interior of Ly\nceum Building and these improve\nments will be made with the greatest\nhaste consistent with good workman\nship. Concrete walks are being laid\nleading from the new buildings to the\nold walks. In short nothing has\nbeen overlooked which will tend to\nadd to the beauty and convenience of\nthe University plant.\nIn addition to the material im\nprovements mentioned, many import\nant changes have been made affect\ning the welfare of the students in a\nreal way. The School of Law will\nrank for the first time as an A-grade\nlaw school, having now met all the\nrequirements of the Association of\nAmerican Law Schools. This has\nbeen made possible by the addition\nof one professor to its faculty, the\nextension of the course of study,\nand the increase in the number of\nlibrary books. The School of Phar\nmacy has been strengthened by the\naddition of one new professor in its\nfaculty. An assistant physical direc\ntor has been employed and the Uni\nversity has also bee.i fortunate\nenough to secure the services of an\ninstructor for track team work. A\nY. M. C. A. secretary is to be in\ncharge of the religious organizations\namong the students next session. The\noutlook for a se.-sion of efficient\nservice is very bright.\n1\n‘\n'\nMILADYS LINGERIE FROCK\nMADE OVER A FOUNDATION\nVARDANIAN RALLY ATTRACTS\nBIG 111 TO OXFORD\nJudge Burch Speaks to Packed House—A.\nC. Anderson Speaks In Interest\nof His Candacy\nLast Monday, July 24, Oxford was\ntreated to a political double header,\nwhen Judge Luther M. Burch of i\nJackson spoke in the courthouse in j\nbehalf of Senator Vardaman and!\nj\nHon. Albert C. Anderson, candidate,\nfor Congress, addressed the voters in 1\nthe interest of his candidacy. The •\nmeeting was opened at 1:30, and an |\naudience that packed the courthouse\ngreeted the spakers. Chancellor J. i\nN. Powers of the University acted as J\nmaster of ceremonies and introduced 1\nthe speakers.\nMr. Anderson’s Speech.\nIn presenting Mr. Anderson to the !\naudience, Chancellor Powers recalled\nto mind the twelve years of distin\nguished service of Mr. Anderson in\nthe state legislature, and his unselfish\nwork in behalf of education. Mr.\nj\nAnderson made an able speech in be\nhalf of his candidacy, reviewing the\npreparation he had had for such a\nposition and outlining his views on the\nimportant questions. He reiterated\nthe charge of fraud in the election of\ntwo years ago and offered to with\ndraw from the race permanently if\nhe did not cany the home county oi\nthe two candidates by a majority of\ntwo to one over his opponent if his\nopponent would make a like agree\nment to withdraw if he did carry it\nby that majority. His speech was j\nwell received and frequently applaud\ned.\nJudge Burch Speaks.\nVery great interest was manifested\nin the man who had come to present\nthe cause o| Senator Vardanian.\nMany in the audience from different\nparts of the county had come with\nthe expectation of hearing Mr. Varda\nnian himself. Chancellor Powrers, in j\npresenting the speaker, stated briefly\nthe reasons why he was not present\nand called attention to the unfairness J\nof those wrho would take advantage j\nof his temporary physical disability\nin order to ride into office. He stat\ned that Mr. Vardaman’s general\nhealth was never better and that his\ninconvenience w*as caused by ill-fit-;\nting false teeth.\nJudge Burch met every expecta\ntion of those who came to hear an\nadequate discussion of Senator Varda\nman’s case. It is doubtful if a man\never had a more earnest and power\nful advocate at the bar of public\nopinion. In language chaste and\npolished and with a fervency that\ncompelled conviction, he carried his\naudience through the years of Varda\nman’s career in the U. S. Senate. He\nlaid bare the record of the faithful\nyears of 1917 and 1918 with telling\nforce and out of their own mouths\ncuiiiuuuueu ms enemies, a cam- i\npaign could not be pitched on higher\nplane than Judge Burch is employ\ning in presenting the case of the\nMan Vardaman. His speech was as\ndevoid of personalities as any pos\nsibly ever delivered in the many ti-:\ntanic political battles waged in the\nMagnolia State.\nHis Senate Record Analyzed.\nIn setting forth the case, the speak- j\ner asserted that die charges com- j\nmonly hurled against Vardaman are,\nthat he is undemocratic, pro-German\nand un-American. He then very per\ntinently asked “What is necessary in\norder that one may be democratic, so\nthat if he does not do these necessary!\nthings he may be branded as undemo-1\ncratic?” To find this out one must\ngo to the local, state and national\nconventions of the Democratic party\nwhich are chosen by the people, and\nthe platforms these conventions draw\nup. Here are found the doctrines of\nthe party and the pledges that bind\nevery candidate for office who seeks\nthe support of the Democratic party\nin obtaining that office. If an office\nholder does or does not live up to\nthese pledges, is the test of whether\nhe is democratic or undemocratic.\nThis acid test and none other should\nbe employed in stigmatizing Mr.\nVardaman.\nThese charges against Mr. Varda\nman grew out of his opposition to\nfive measures which came up in the\nSenate of the United States during\nthe troubled period of our entrance\ninto the European War. These mea\nsures were: The Panama Canal Tolls\nBill; The Armed Neutrality Bill;\nThe Selective Service or Draft Law;\nThe Ship Purchase Bill; and the De\nclaration of War.\nHow did the Democratic party and\nMr. Wilson, its standard bearer in\n1912 and 1816, and who, later, be\ncause of his stand, heaped so much\nvitriolic abuse on Mr. Vardaman,\nstand on the question of tolls on\nships passing through the canal. The\nplatform framed by the Baltimore\nconvention, expressed in unequivoca.\nterms its opposition to levying a toll\non our coastwidetrade, and Mr. Wil\nson in speech after speech before the\nfarmers of the Atlantic Coast states\nreiterated his allegiance to that\npledge, stating that the phrase in\nquestion was not “molasses to catch\nflies with but means business.” Why\nwas Mr. Vardanian undemocratic in\nopposing the bill that violated this\nsolemn pledge made to the people\nand on which the Democratic party\nwas entrusted with power.\nThe Armed Neutrality Bill.\nThere is such a thing as an honest\ndifference of (Opinion between men\nwhich some people in their hysteria\nseem to have overlooked. And, cer\ntainly when the nation is not at war\nthe right to express one’s opinion\nand fight for it within legitimate\nbounds had never before beer, seri\nously questioned in this country, since\nthat right is one of the foundation\nstones used by the builders of this\nnation. The Armed Neutrality Bill,\nlet it be recalled, came up before\nthis nation went to war. It had for\nif-Q niirnnco flio tjrminrv Aiir mpr.\nchant vessels. Some people, who\nare conceded to be honest, believe\nthat the carrying of a weapon does\nnot prevent trouble, but invites it.\nMr. Vardaman is of that opinion.\nWhat was Mr. Wilson’s opinion? Is\nthere a child in this country above\nten years of age who can ever for\nget t’ t admonition of the president\nso pt antly flashed before his\neyes n he moving picture shows\nand w ose calcium light burned so\ndeeply the impress on the tablet of\nhis memory: “Be neutral not only\nin act but be neutral in thought”?\nWas Mr. Vardaman, or any one else\npro-German in attempting to follow\nthat admonition? Has any one for\ngotten that after Congress had re\nfused to change fronts with Mr. Wil\nson and pass the bill, that the presi\ndent attempted, out of the plenitude\nof his executive powers, to arm the\nships and after a trivial reversed\nhimself and came back to his original\nposition? But because some sena\ntors honestly differed with him,\nthey wfere caustically referred to 'as\n' the twelve little wilful men.” When,\npray, the speaker asked, was the\nexclusive power of the entire gov\nernment constitutionally given into\nthe hands of one man?\nMr. Vardanian, along with many\nhonorable patriotic men and women,\nhonestly believed that a volunteer\narmy could be raised su..cient!y\nlarge to prosecute the war to a suc\ncessful close without recourse to the\ndraft. He opposed its passage be\ncause he believed in the patriotism\nof Amercian men to fill the ranks as\nthey were needed. How, the speaker\nasked, do the returned soldiers feel\nabout another draft? “Mothers of\nMississippi, how do you stand on\nconscription today” ?\nJudge Burch referred to the Ship\nPurchase Bill as “too silly for dis\ncussion before an intelligent audi\nthe fruits of that iniquitous law\nhang like a millstone obout the necks\nof the American people. At a cost of\nthree billion dollars and in direct de\nfiance of the Democratic platforms\nof 1904, 1908, 1912 and 1916 a fleet\nof 1442 ships has been built and only\n429 are nt>w being used.\nDeclaration of War.\nSince Mr. Vardaman has been so\nvenomously attacked about his op\nposition to a declaration of war at\nthe time it was made, a careful read\ning of the record nnd the utterances\nof leading men is enlightening. Many\nseem to have forgot the issues of the\ncampaign of 1916. Is any one silly\nenough to charge the Democratic\nparty with making the race on a war\nplatform? Mr. Ollie James, in mak\njir.g the keynote speech before the\nSt. Louis convention in 1916, referred\nio Mr. Wilson epigrammatically\nthus: “He kept us out of war,”and\nthe election was won on fnat battle\ncry, yet the Lusitania had gone down\ntwelve months before the convention\nwas held. On January 1, 1917, just\nthree months before a declaration of\nwar was asked for, Mr. Wilson de\nclared before Congress that every\ndifference between America and Ger\nmany had been settled with complete\nhonor to America. In the meantime\nhe had made his celebrated “^Too\nproud to fight” Speech. These facts\nare incontrovertible and even the\nwayfaring man can understand them.\nIs it Un-American to fail to change\nyour mind as often as another man\neven though that man be president\nof these United States?\nThere are those who believe the\npresident might have consistently\nlistened to constructive criticism and\nstill the war would have been won.\nHad he done so the Democratic party\nmight have been spared the igno\nminious defeat of 1920, when it was\nburied beneath an avalanche of 7,\nAAA AAA i. . .

So great was the fall\nthat even William J. Bryan, who had\nthree times ridden to defeat on the\nwithers of the Democratic donkey,\nexclaimed that the party was dead.\nHe, too, was mistaken. It’s not dead\nor dying, it simply needed fumigat\ning.\nThe principles of the Democratic\nparty lie as deep in the aspirations\nof the people as its dearest senti\nments.

The speech was\nfrequently punctuated with applause.\nJudge Burch expressed great con\nfidence in the outcome of the pri\nmary, predicting after having been\nin 82 counties, that Mr. Vardaman\nwould carry the state by a majority\nof 20,000 to 40,000.\nFUNERAL OF THE\nLATE W.

Gibson.) ii\n— j c\nMemphis, Tenn., July 25.—It is,i\nvery likely that there never was a;]\ntime in the history of this country, (\nwhen it was more necessary for busi- ,\nness people to sit down and ‘ talk it >,\nover” than at this critical period in |\nthe world’s march of progress. jj\nIn our industrial, commercial and ;\nfinancial relations, more or less of a\'j\nstate of chaos and uncertainty exists, }\nand the .situation today is far more j\nserious than it was a year ago. Our!,\nproblems have decreased in number j(\nduring that year, but unsettled condi- ,\ntions throughout the world have add- j\ned to their complexity.\nDoing business in this good year is\nnot a matter of mere buying and sell\ning of merchandise. It involves a\nscientific application of an energy\nand industry that was .practically,\ncrushed during the hey-day of war j\ninflation. The war boom did morei\nharm than good, because it efiminat- i\ned the necessity for caie and caution i\nin the buying and selling of goods. It\nwas not a question of what to buy and j\nwhen, but the problem which worried\nthe merchant then was where can I\nget in and how soon. Experts in com\nmerce, finance, industry and agricul\ninrp_the four trreat fundamentals of\nall business and the vehicles of pros\nperity—are agreed that the best\nthing for American business men to\ndo is to get at the real facts of the ,\nsituation confronting them. The man\nwho knows the cause of his adversity,\nv who gets at the root of an evil condi\ntion, is better equipped to make the\nfight tlvan the man who is unacquaint\ned with the facts and who seeks to\nescape the inevitable"""result of his\nignorance by administering to him\nself the soothing opiate of fase opti\n| mism.\nThe need for new ideas and a more\nintimate knowledge of the facts is\never present and is absolute, i he\nold adage “The truth will make you !\nfree” was never more applicable to a\ncondition than to that which now\nI xists in every country of the world.\nKnowledge of the truth about busi\nness can be gained only thru the ex\n| change of ideas and individual opin\n| ions and a constant study of the\nsituation as it unfolds itself from day\n| to day. I\nThe point is set out very clearly in\nthe accompanying cartoon. Mr. Alley\nhas put a brilliant idea on paper so\nthat the world may visualize the mes\nsage that is of prime importance to\nthe business man. Every business\nnan in the country may well study\nmd ponder the lesson which the car\noonist presents so forcibly in this\nittle strip. It forms a basis tor an\n•ducation which every business man\nmd farmer—yes, every individual—\n•hould have.\nJust a word about the idea depicted\nlere.\nThe progressive fanner knows that\nlis car, which is his business, will\niot run without gasoline. The gaso\nine in this case contains the fund\nimentals without which no business\n:an succeed. They are ideas, the\nrade at home policy, community\noyalty, co-operation and service,\nrhis merchant is filling his tank with\ni fuel that will carry him over the\n■ough roads to greater prosperity\nind success.\nIn the foreground is seen the non\nprogressive, skeptical merchant, who\n;hies at anything that is new. He\nias no faith in ideas, in modern\n:hought, in up-to-the-minute methods\naf doing business. He is still using\nthe old methods and following the\naid policy of false economy. He\nimagines that he is too busy to take\nthe proper care of The instrument\nwith wfBcli he does business. He\nplugs by the "filling station” but—\ntake a look at the lower section of\nthe cartoon.\nIt is here that the man who em\nploys worn-out business methods\nrealizes that he would have saved\nboth time and money if he had paus\ned at the “filling station” for gaso\nline and Tepairs to his rickety tinliz\nzie. Moreover, he sees now that the\nmachine of his business would run\nbetter and would last longer, if he\nwould *stop now and then to have the\nmotor tuned. The moral may be\nstated in a single sentence: Prepare\nfor adversity while you are in the\nmidst of prosperity.\nThe Ninth Annual Convention of\nthe Cotton States Merchants Asso\nciation will be held in Memphis,\nAugust 16, 17, 18, inclusive. It is the\nfilling station at which southern busi\nness men may stop their cars and re\nceive a supp’y of fuel that will make\nthe old machine run like a new one\nand carry them over the rough places\nin the road to better business. This\nConvention is a clearing house of\nideas, where merchants, bankers and\nbusiness men may gather and ex\nchange experiences, profiting from\nthe lessons which they learn from\neach other. They may discuss their\nbusiness and prepare themselves for\navoidance of blunders in the future\nby learning of the errors of the past.\nNo man’s business is a ket to the\ngeneral situation. One may succeed\nkvhile his neighbor fails. It is up to\n:he failed merchant to seek knowedge\nin the successful experience of his\nneighborhood and avoid a repetition\njf his own fallacies.\nA brief outline of the programme\nfor the convention will give the mer\n:hauts of the territory some idea of\n:he value of it to the business men of\n:he South. j\nThe features of the first day’s ses\nsion will be addresses By Cnas.

Mayor\nRowlett Paine, Mayor of memphis\nwill welcome the merchants on the\npart of the City and A. Grant Ma\nthews will deliver the welcome ad\ndress.

The road\nconnects Hammond, Louisiana and\nMemphis, passing through Magnolia,\nM£Comb, Brookhaven, Hazlehur.-t,\nJackson, Canton, Greenwood, Clarks\ndale, Tunica, and Memphis.\nWith the surfacing of this link,\nlocated between Doak’s Creek and\nPickens, a distance of nine and six ;\ntenths miles, the entire highway will\'\nhave a gravel surface, with the ex-!\nception of six and four tenths miles\nbetween Magnolia and McComb,\nwhich is of vitrified brick. The sur\nfacing of this road* is to be a federal i\nAid Project, and plans call for an !\neighteen foot gravel surface. The\nconstruction of the road bed and\ndrainage structures were also a Fed\neral Aid Project, it having been\ncompleted as a graded road, February\n2, 1922.\nIn this highway, there are eight\nFederal Aid Projects, or stretches of\nroad, which were constructed with\nthe aid of Federal funds. Three of\nthese projects are located in Pike\nCounty, two in Lincoln, one in Hoi\nmes, one in iumca, and one in Madi\nson, making a total of forty-six and\ntwenty-one hundredths miles. All of\nthese projects are surfaced with\ngravel, with the exception of the road\nbetween JTagnolia and McComb, and\nwith few exceptions, the drainage\nstructures are of concrete and steel.\nThe completion of tms hignway will\nmean much to the State, and it is one\nof three main trunk lines north and\nsouth highways called for by the\nproposed State Highway System,\nwhich will be submitted to the people\nfor ratification at the general elec\ntions in November. The completion of\nthis highway is the culmination of\nsix years of effort on the part of the\nHighway Department, and the eleven\ncounties through which it passes, and\nthey should feel justly proud of it. If\nFederal Aid allotments continue at\nthe present rate, the day is not far\ndistant when Mississippi will have a\nState Highway System, which will\nconnect every county seat and center\nof population of six hundred or more\nin the State, and which will also co\nordinate with the systems of adjacent\nstates, thus connecting the entire\ncountry with a system of roads, which\nwill be kept open for travel during\nthe entire three hundred and sixty\nfive days in the year.\nBoost Your Home Pa\nper, The Eajrle\nHEAD OF MINE WORKERS AND SEuETARY OF LABOR CONFER.\nJohn L.

College, Miss., July 18.—\nAccording to the permits on file in\nthe office of the State Plant Board,\nthe farmers of Mississippi have per\nhaps broken all former record- this\nspring for buying cotton seed for\nplanting purposes from other st -ie\nThis year permits were if-ued for the\nshipment of 102,112 bushels of plant\ning seed into Mississippi, or more\nthan four times the amount purchased\noutside the State in 1921. Tins\namount covers planting seed onlv m\ndoes not include seed for crushing\nor other purposes.\nThough Mississippi has a -t:ict\nquarantine against cotton seed from\nTexas, Oklahoma, New Mex'co, a d\nWestern Louisiana on account of the\npink bollworm, there is always 1be\npossibility of shipments coming from\nan undiscovered infestation in an un\nquarantined state. Because of this\nsetious danger of bringing in the pink\nbollworm or other pests from other\nstates, and also on account of the high\nprice of the imported seed and the\nhigh express and freight charges the\nMississippi buyers are paying it will\nbe a laudable and progressive step\nsays P. P. Garner, Co nmissionet of\nAgriculture and unairman ot xne\nState Plant Board, if fanners will be\ngin now to make preparations to\nsave their owrn planting seed for the\ncrop of 11)23. Where a farmer is not\nsatisfied with the cotton that he is\nnow growing, he could make arrange\nment with one of his neighbors or\nwith some other reliable Mississippi\nplanter or cotton breeder to supply his\nneeds. It is a matter of pride th^t\nMississippi has within her borders\nsome of the outstanding leaders in\ncotton breeding.\nPUBLIC SCHOOL TRUSTEES\nSome of our finest men and wo\nmen in Mississippi are trustees of\ncur public schoos and are doing a\ngreat work. There are, however,\nsome Trustees who, seemingly, think\nvery little of the office they hold. The\\\ndo not realize that the proper train\ning and education of our children is\nthe state’s really one big business.\nA good Trustee must possess some\nof the following qualifications:\n1. Feel the responsibility that\ngoes with the office and appreciate\nthe fine opportunity of doing a real\nservice for the children and the peo\nple generally.\n2. Know what it takes to make |\na good school. If he does not know\nhe will find out.\ny. Be Honest. If he is honest he\nwill be fair with the children, Coun\nty Superintendent, and fellow Trus\ntees in the operation of the school.\nSuch a Trustee will vote to employ\nonly the very best teachers it is pos\nsible to get irrespective of friend-,\nship, kinship, denominationalism, or '\nanything else.\n4. Be broad-minded. Any person\nwho is narrow, full of prejudice,\nwhose mind is not open to conviction, j\nor who is easily offended is not quali- j\nfied .to hold any office of importance.!\n5. Be a leader. In order for the\nschool to do its best work it will be\nnecessary for the Trustees to so leaad\nthe people as to cause them to feel\nproud of the school, and to give it\ntheir whole-hearted, active support.\n_ |\nGEAN—ANDERSON.\nA Wedding of wide interest was\nsolemnized at the home of Mrs.\nDora Anderson, of Altus, Sunday af\nternoon at four o’clock when Miss\nGabrie Anderson became the bride of\nMr. Chesley Gean.

About 90 per\ncent of the flocks of Mississippi were\ninfected last year, some in a mild\nform while others suffered severe at\ntacks and lost large numbers of birds.\nThis disease is caused by a fungus\nand may be transmitted from one\nflock to another on the feet of animal\nor man. This fungus thrives in cool,\ndamp places and the disease is high\nly contagious. A small pustule first\nappears somewhere on the head and\ndevelops into the pox or sore. The\nbirds lose their appetite and color,\ngradually becoming thin and emaciat\ned, finally dying if not treated. The\nsame preventative measure should be\nused as in roup. The same serum is\nalso effective as a vaccine affecting a\ncure.\nWhen sorehead is noticed in the\nflock, separate the affected birds and\ntreat as follows if you do not wish to\nuse the vaccine, rub aseline on the\nsore to soften the scab, then remove\nit and apply iodine. This treatment\nhas produced very satisfactory re\nsults.\nROUP.\nThere are three forms of roup—\neye, nose and throat. The eye be\ncomes swollen and a pus accumula\ntion is noticed. If nothing is done\nfor it, a cheesy material will form in\nthe eye and the bird will finally die.\nThis same cheesy material is seen in\nthe throat and nasal passages when\nthe birds have those forms.\nThe feeding of salts and sulphur is\nsupposed to act as a preventative\nmeasure. The salts may be given\nin the water or feed only once, one\nteaspoonful to two birds. Give the\nsulphur twice per week for two weeks,\none tablespoonful to a quart of mash.\nIf the bird is affeted the eye form\nshould be treated by squeezing all the\nsecretion out of the eye and dropping\ntwo or three drops of the following\npreparation in the eyes twice daily,\ni Oil of Thyme, 20 drop. .\nOil of Eucalyptus, 30 drop.-.\nMenthol, 10 grains.\nOil of Petrol, 2 ounces.\nThe nasal or throat form h aid be\ntreated by holding the beak and nasal\ni\nopenings submerged in a solution of\ncommon baking soda (1 teaspoonful\nI\nto 1 pint of water) until the bird\n1 draws the solution up into* the no=e\nland throat. This will cause the bird!\ni\nto sneeze and cough out the cheesy\n■material. Then swab out the throat\nwith peroxide of hydrogen or argy- j\nrol. »\nThe latest deveoptnent in the treat\nment of roup is to vaccinate each in\ndividual with Avian serum. This se\n| rum is more valuable as a preventa\ni tive but has a high curative value.\nThe writer assisted in vaccinating a\nflock of 127 chicks with severe cases\n| of roup, eve form. We onlv had\nI\nenough serum for 102 and all these\n1102 recovered with the exception of\ntwo, while the 25 that were not treat- 1\nled died.

The former\nator appears to be in good physi-j\ncondition and was in splendid\n■its.

S. A.

He also produced\necords showing the constructive acts\nif Vardanian while governor and as\nenator.\nJudge Burch also discussed the un\nairness of the campaign made\ngainst Senator Vardanian in 1918,\nnd appealed to the people of Missis\nippi to discard all bias and feeling\nnd to vote for or against Vardaman,\not on what his enemies said but on\nhe records made by him, while as\n;overnor and senator. His speePh was\navorably received, being frequently\nnterrupted by applause, and at the\nim.\nJudge D. W. Houston was next in\nroduced by Mr. Witherspoon, and\niscussed the record made by Varda\nlan, particularly while in the senate,\nle showed how the differences be\nween Vardaman and President Wil\non began, explaining in detail how;\nach stood on the great questionsj\nbout which they differed, how that j\nifference grew, and like Judge;\nlurch, produced records, among them j\nhe platform of the democratic party,\'\nhowing that those votes for which\n’ardaman had been charged to be;\nndemocratic, were really in accord\n,-ith the platform, and that Varda\nnan, would not have been a true\nemocrat had he voted otherwise,\nudge Houston also discussed the ^\n;reat service rendered by Vardaman\no the people of the Mississippi delta,\n11 the passage of the flood control\n■ill, reading telegrams to show that\nTardaman was accorded the honor by\nhose in authority, for the passage\nf that bill through the senate. He\niext discussed his services to laborj\nnd his support of prohibition, child j\nabor laws and other measures,\nhampioned by the women of the\nountry.

Turner,\nDear Sir:\nYou want me to give you a few\nhints in regard to a fellow painting\nhis own home.\nPlease le.t it be understood right\nat the very start, that I will now,\nand forever hereafter be pleased to\nhelp you and everybody in Lafayette\ncounty to get their homes or what\never they may want painted, as cheap, •\neconomical and lasting as ever pos\nsible.\nYou want to know how much it\ntakes to paint a square—it’s all ow\ning to circumstances. I mean by\nthat, its according to the condition\nthe .-urface is in at the time you want\nto paint it. Many paint concerns I\nsuppose would tell you that his paint\nwould cover 2 squares with one gal\nlon. Yes I believe jnost of them j\nwould provided it doesn’t need to be j\npainted, but 99 per cent if not more,\'\npaint when it has been needed for 10\n/ears or more. As we are living in\na country where ony a few houses\nare painted nearly as often as they\nshould be, and a few more every 8 or\n10 years and all the rest of them not\nat all, we better figure with those\nthat has been needing paint for years.\nI have seen houses of that kind which\nwould drink over a gallon of paint to\nthe square. But as yoq are not sell\ning paint by the gallon; I believe it\nwould serve you better to know just\nabopt how much it would cost to paint\nan average farm house that never\nhad paint on it before. Two coats of\nlead and oil, and one coat of pure\ngreen seal zinc including brushes and\nJapanese dryer would cost about $32.\nOne hundred pounds white lead\nshould lake about 5 gallons of oil for\npriming, however, twice that amount\nof oil should be employed. A house\nthat never has been painted before\nand is old, should never be painted\nwith paint that has turpentine or\ngasoline in it, if however one of the\ntwo are used, it should be only in fue\nsecond coat, only a very little, iust\nenough to make the paint work easv,\nand gasoline is by far the best, as it\nevaporates and leaves the oil up\nThere\'s always something new taking place in the\nworld of music. Even the famous old songs are\nalways turning up in new situations, as new artists\ninterpret them. New light on works and personages\nold and famous is constantly developing. Therefore\nwe publish this review as information and as a guide\nfor our readers to what’s new concerning music and\nmusicians.\nLUCREZIA BORI’S English accent\nis her very own. Unless you have\nheard it, you can\'t guess how de\nUightfully piquant it is. However, you\nmay hear it on your Victrola for the\n(first time during August, for her most\nrecent record is her first in English.\nThe song, appropriately enough, is one\nof Thomas Moore’s—“When Love Is\nKind”—dealing lightly with such a\nserious subject. Musically this record\nis a delicately chiselled cameo, leaping\na light octave at the climax like the\nlast flashing kick of a toe-dancer.\nThe peace and fragrance of some old\nworld garden are in a charming new\nrecord by Emilio De Gogorza on the\nAugust lists. "1 Knott) a Lovely\nCarden” is one of Mme. Guy\nD\' Hardelot’s simplest and finest, free\nfrom false sentiment, and sung with the\neasy finish and human sympathy of the\ntrue artist.\nThere’s another touch of simple,\nhonest sentiment in a new record by\nMischa Elman—"La Cinquantaine”\n(The Ga’den Wedding). It is one of\nthe best-known of popular old-world\nmelodies, and many who cannot call it\nbv name, will recognize it on hearing.\nIt is pi: yed in simple, natural fashion,\nyet with a quaint and minuet-like grace.\nToward the end the bow is insufficient,\nand the finger-tip of the artist is called\ninto play for a series of “harmonics,”\nkeen ar.d high as the soft notes of a\npiccolo.\n* * *\nf” ^ Wagner’s “Lohengrin” will\nbe seventy-two ye^rs old in\nAugust, having been produced\ntin 1850. Yet it still, like\nv Wagners other works, is\nspoken of as “modern.” “Par\nsifal,” which did not see the\nlight until i88z, was practi\ncally begun almost as early as\n« the production of “Lohen\n“ grin,” its first germ dating\n^ far back as 1857.\n* * *\nl *\n-duravc t-lio Grnr’fp of\nAVagner’s works, Tannhduser will again\nbe heard at the Metropolitan next sea\nson, after a lapse of several years.\nThere are three new records from this\nappealing opera on the iist of new\nVictor Records for August. One is\nthat noble scene where Elizabeth, in\nvain having sought Tannhduser among\nthe pilgrims returning forgiven, from\nRome, prays for his soul at the way\nside shrine, and dedicates herself to the\nreligious life. It is here sung by Maria\nJeritza, the Metropolitan’s greit new\ndramatic soprano, interpreted through\ncut with fine dramatic sense.\nMARIE\nJERITZA\nv ERIKA\nr« MORIN I\nt\ni\nThe very essence of pagan nature\nworship is in Rimsky-Korsakow’s\nweird “Hymne au Soleil’’ ( riyrnn to the\nSun) from his completely fantastic\nopera “Le Coq D’Or’’ (The Golden\nCockerel). It is a number that calls\nfor such perfection of style as Galli\nCurci’s, and for August she makes a\nrecord of it that will enchant the\nsearcher for the unnsual in” music.\nThere is nothing like it anywhere in\nmusic—that melody addressed to the\nrising sun by the beautiful, pagan\nQueen of Shemakha, homesick for her\nEastern realm. The voice is carried on\nthe wildest chromatic scales and pas\nsages through the strangest harmonies,\nhere sung in perfect style where l^ie\nslightest fault would spell ruin.\nWhile the story of “Le Roi d’Ys"\n(The King of Ys) is not pleasant, the\nmusic is lyrical and full o: grace. For\nAugust Gigli makes a splendid record\nof the “Vainetnent, via bien aimee”\n(In Vain, My Beloved), the marriage\npong of Mylio. Particularly noteworthy\nis Gigli\'s taking of a wonderful, sub\ndued high B flat in the middle, a vel\nvety high note, which is again repeated\nbefore it dies down to a faint yet\nequally beautiful close.\nOlga Samaroff’s new piano record of\nMendelssohn’s Spring Song is a re\nmarkable example of both the interpre\ntative and the recording arts. The ever\nfamiliar melody is played with ex\nquisite tone-sense by Mme. Samarotf\n(in private life Mrs. Leopold Sto\nkowski), each note being as clear and\ndistinct as a tiny globe in a String yf\npearls. _ *\n^ * + *\n\'"Pr\nSir Henry Rowley Bishop,\nwho wrote the “Echo Song’’\nMane. Galli-Curci has record\ned, was an interesting figure\nin English music. His tirst\ndramatico-musical composi\ntion was performed in 1804,\nwhen he was eighteen years\nold. Five years later another\nWork, “The Circassian Bride,"\nwas given at Covent Garden.\nOn the second night the his\ntorically tatnous tire destroyed\nthe house, and with it\nBishop’s score. He survived\nthe loss, however. During his\nlife he was credited with\nwriting, with adapting, or\nproducing more than a h*n\ndred pieces for the stage. Iji 3\nbest-known song today is\n“Home, Sweet Home"—rather\na contrast to the “Echo\nSong" and his “Lo. Here the\nGentle Lark,” which Galli\nC\'urci already has sung for us.\n.* * *\nOne of Schumann’s most poetic, if\ncomparatively little known compositions\nis "Am Springbrunnen” (At the Foun\ntain) which Erika Morini plays on a\nnew record for August. It makes a\ndelightful violin study, with its swift\ntwo-note harmonies ascending and de\nscending the chromatic scale like the\nmelodious play of falling waters. De\nspite the swift pace of the piece, the\ncomposer never lost the melodic sense,\nand Morini on this record holds it mar\nvelously herself.\nAs a companion to its record, the\nAllegro of Haydn\'s Quartet in D Major\nissued in February, for August Flon\nzaley Quartet plays the second, or slow\nmovement, the Adagio Cantabile. Com\nposed in a rich, full, generous style, it\nis slow, reflective, yet with not a single\nmoment of empty and senseless reverie.\nThis record is one more contribution\nby Flonzaley Quartet to enrich the\nmusical world. ^\nThe Dances They’re\nDoing Now\nTEN new fox trot numbers, a regu\nlation waltz and a medley waltz\nare the Victor contribution to the\nmidsummer dance program for August.\nThe Virginians monopolize things on\ntwo complete records all their very own\nin August. “Lonesome Mamma” is a\nfine, horsey “blues” record with a de\nlightful, lazy rhythm. Whether a\nMemphis, Egypt, mummy or a Mem\nphis, Tenn., flat-boat stevedore, “Mem\nphis Blues” on the reverse of this rec\nord would, certainly start the feet\nmoving. ,\nRoss Gorman, director of the Vir\nginians, plays three separate instru\nments during one of the numbers this\norganization plays for its second rec\nord in August—two saxophones and a\nclarinet. He does this in ‘ Nobody\nLied,” an easy, slow, somewhat gro\ntesque number. On the other side is\n“Yankee Doodle■’Biues,” somewhat of\na snappy melody tor a blues record,\nwith snatches ot well-known airs, bogle\nnotes and other decorations.\n"Moon River” is a good name :or a\nwaltz. Wherever it may be, the waltz\nabout "Moon River" Green Brothers\'\nMarimba Orchestra plays on an August\nrecord is equally well-named. It is\nfull of soft moonlight effects, with a\nsubtle counter-play of melody through\nout the record. Sharing this record,\nHackel-Berge Orchestra plays a med\nley waltz—\'Love Sends a Little Gift\nof Roses”—introducing “When Eyes\nMeet Eyes.” It has full rich har\nmonies, easily waltzed to.\nOne of the best parts about modern\ndancing is its ease. Ali Star Trio anj\nTheir Orchestra and Club Royal\nOrchestra share a record between them\nwith two very good and very easy to*\ntrots. ‘‘Soothing” by the former organ\nization is in moderate tempo, with\nstrong accents. "Night” by Club Royal\nOrchestra has modern harmonies,\nbitter-sweet, like grape-fruit. These\ntwo dances are simple in structure, will*\nno trick rhythms.\nIt wouldn’t seem right to embark\nupon August without a couple of new\nWhiteman dances. There are there\nfore two on a single record, one by the\ncomposer who wrote "Mon Homme1\'\n(My Mail). It"s called “It’s Up to\nYou,” though originally entitled some\nthing French. It is lively, almost like\na French sappers’ march, played with\nsuperb linish. “ \'Meath the South Sea\nMoon" has also the characteristic\nWhiteman dash, completing a very\nsatisfactory record.\nEvery State* has equal rights as to\nits way of dancing the fox trot. Just\nto give some idea of the variance of\nthese ways, hear Club Royal Orchestra\nplay "Syncopate" a medley fox trot,\nand then turn it over to see what the\nBenson Orchestra of Chicago does with\n”Little Thoughts." The first has a\nmoderate tempo, but short snappy ac\ncents, with some suspicious hints of\njazz. There’s no doubt about "Little\n\'Thoughts." It is in steady, tine tempo\nthroughout, with a good resonant bass,\nentirely devoid of any vinegary edectsj\nVocal Solo—Duct and\nQuarl„t Numbers\nMANY of us can rtmember\n“Violets,” a song thatflhas sur\nvived .much inferior stuff since\nthe day of its great popularity. Merle\nAlcock sings it charmingly on an\nAugust Victor record, it is a fine ex\nposition of her voice and simpler ballad\nstyle.\n“Giannina Mia” \\^dch Lucy Isabelle\nMarsh sings on the|n?^rse of this rec\nord, has a lovelyismooth rhythm, some\nthing like a Venetian barcarolle, with\nsoft flowing counter-melodies in deep\nbrass rising through it to meet the\nvoice.\nOlive Kline and Elsie Baker sirlg in\nduet two sweet and tranquil Christian\nhymns on a new record for August.\n“We Would See Jesus" lias for it3\ntune the beautiful and familiar ‘\'Con\nsolation” of Felix Mendelssohn. “Jesus.\nMy All” is set to an bid melody of\nprobably Scotch and Irish origin.\nThese two hymns are interesting\nstudies in contrast, the solemn strains\nof the first being in decided contrast\nto the more lyric measures of the\nsecond.\n* * *\nLieut-Commander J o h a\n^Philip Sousa wears a new !\npair of kid gloves, and white i\nones at that, at every concert\nhe conducts. They are espe\ncially made for him, and or\ndered in large quantities, one\norder, it is announced, con\nsisting of no less than 1,200 j\npairs. His yearly bill for\ngloves alone is larger than\nthat of any metropolitan so\nciety woman. It is about his\nonly foible, and he indulges\nit freely. No one ever sees\nhim lift a baton in public ex\ncept with an immaculately\ngloved hand.\n* * *\nSummer moonlight is the pat setting\n•for male voices in close harmony.\nPeerless Quartet and Sterling Trio\nshare one of the new August records\nwith two tunes that go well with the\nmellow August moon. “Rock Me In\nMy Swanee Cradle" by Peerless Quar\ntet has fine vocal harmonies, introduc\ning the original “Swanee River” as an\ninterlude. Of a sentimental stripe is\n“Old Kentucky Moonlight," Sterling\nTrio’s offering. It is in waltz tempo,\nwith soft, melting harmonies, sung with\nfine, sympathetic power.\nThere are some excellent records in\nlighter vein by Billy Murray, Charles\nHarrison and Aileen Stanley, both sing\nly and in combination, to lighten the\nweight of dog days.\nTne entire Victor list as usual is\nwell-balanced, and well worth hearing\nin the whole. T\nharmed. A house that is well kept,\nyou cun use right smart for the first\ncoat, a little for the second, but not\nany for the last coat. If only two\ncoats are wanted use a little for the\nfirst coat and not any for the last\ncoat.\nPutty i? always needed when paint\ning a house; bought putty is very in\nferior and entirely too high. Mix a\nlittle Spanish •whiting with pure lin\nseed oil just as you would make bis\ncuit-. .It don’t c< :-t half as much and,\nlast you a lifetime if used right. Nev\ner putty before a coat of paint has\nbeen applied. If you want. to put new\nglass in a window, clean the groove\nof ail the old. putty, paint the groove\nand while the putty is till wet, place\na tin!, layer of putty in the groove,\npress your glass gently down so it\nsqueezes nearly all the putty out.\nAfter that is done, use eight glasses\npaint and finish puttying. A window\nwindow sash if you use the kind of\nputty I reccommend. ‘\nAs you are mostly doing business\nwith the farmers, I suppose it would\noe oi great interest to know some\nthing about paint for farm imple\nments. We know that only very few\nfarmers have housing for the imple\nments they have, and that is one rea\nson why a man; (when he buys .paint)\nshould not lose sight of the fact, th\'i t\nit’s not all gold that glitters. We see\nevery day advertisements about beau\ntiful colors of mixed paint for farm\ntools; but it’s just like so many beau\ntiful flowers they don’t last no time.\nAnother thing, farmers never were\nvery artistic—look at their homes!\nLord know.-; the farmers hasn’t money\nto throw away, so suppose we leave\nthe glitter to the fools. With a gil\nlon of pure raw linseed oil, in cent\nforth of Japanese dryer, and about\n5 pounds of oxide of iron, I think it\nwill give enough paint to give ad im\nplements on an average farm 3 coats\non all wooden parts and 2 coats on all\niron. It would cost about $2.00 a gal\nlon of beautiful ready mixes paint\nwould cost about $6.00 a gallon, it i\nwouldn’t go half as far, wou’d lose \\\nits glitter in three months, and the\noxide of iron would outlast it in color\nand service 10 to 1. Now men make\nup your mind to paint your house to\nmorrow. Therefore if peopie would\ngive you an idea as to what they ;\nwant, and in what shape the thing is\nin they want to paint; I could do far j\nmore for each individual person than\nfc* I\nGIRL ATHLETE CHOSEN FOR WOMEN’S MEET IN PARIS.

BEANLAND ENTERTAIN!\nOne of the most delightful and in\nteresting social events that has oc\ncurred in Oxford in many years tool\nplace at the beautiful home of Mrs\nE. D. Beanland last Friday afternoon\nwhen a host of friends were charm\ningly entertained at a miscellaneous\nshower given in honor of Miss Wort\nley Kirkwood, who is to wed Mr. W\nH. Carothers of Clarksdale on August\n8th. The guests were welcomed by\nthe hostess in her accustomed charm\ning manner and w'ere directed to find\nplaces at the artistically arranged\nbridge tables on the lawn, where an\nhour was pleasantly spent at this\npopular game. At the conclusion of\nthe card party the bride-to-be took\nher place of honor, a settee tastefully\nfestooned with fragile crepe myrtle\nblossoms, her dainty lovliness en\nhanced by the contrasting pale green\nof her clinging georgette gown and\nthe rose pink of the flowers. Just\nhere a messenger from Cupid, in the\nperson of Miss Buffaloe dressed in\nfluffy pink organdie with ci'own and\n'wand, danced forth, poetically ex\npressing good wishes and introducing\nCupids’ Darts, five little tots heavily\nladen with gifts. These interesting\nlooking packages were thrown down\nat the feet of the honoree, who pro\nceeded to open each and read aloud\nthe messages of advice which ac\ncompanied the gifts. When this\npleasant task was ended, the guest of\nhonor was literally surrounded by the\nmany lovely offerings, including vari\nous articles daintily hand-embroider\ned household linen,' exquisite hand\nkerchiefs and other useful and beau\ntiful accessories. Mrs. Beanland was\nassisted by Mesdames Buffaloe, Dav\nidson, and Glenn in serving a delicious\nsalad course. The artistic favor for\neach guest was a tiny pink basket\nbearing a gay butterfly and a wee\nwedding bell. While the guests were\n^reluctantly bidding adieu, the bride\ngroom surprised the party by ap\npearing in time to exchange a few\nwords of greeting.\nx ' -r ’ ___\n/ V,\nTULA\ni\nc\n. >\n- MATHEWSON PITCHES ONCE\nMORE.\n; The idol of all baseball fans,\nand the best of his days in the\nBig Leagues, Christy Mathew\nson, almost completely cured of\nhis dreaded sickness, pitched his\nfirst ball since becoming ill, to\nopen first game and a new lea\ngue at Saranac Lake, N.
