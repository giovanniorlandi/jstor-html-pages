Restoration works have been accelerated substantially\nin Turkey in the last decade. Many historical buildings,\nmosques, minaret, bridges, towers and structures have been\nrestored. With these restorations an important issue arises,\nnamely how restoration work affects the structure. For this\nreason, we aimed to investigate the restoration effect on the\nearthquake response of a historical masonry mosque considering\nthe openings on the masonry dome. For this pur-\npose, we used the Hüsrev Pasha Mosque, which is located\nin the Ortakapı district in the old city of Van, Turkey. The\nregion of Van is in an active seismic zone; therefore, earthquake\nanalyses were performed in this study. Firstly a finite\nelement model of the mosque was constructed considering\nthe restoration drawings and 16 window openings on the\ndome. Then model was constructed with eight window openings.\nStructural analyses were performed under dead load\nand earthquake load, and the mode superposition method\nwas used in analyses. Maximum displacements, maximum–\nminimum principal stresses and shear stresses are given with\ncontours diagrams. The results are analyzed according to\nTurkish Earthquake Code (TEC, 2007) and compared between\n8 and 16 window openings cases. The results show\nthat reduction of the window openings affected the structural\nbehavior of the mosque positively.\n1 Introduction\nMasonry is the oldest and a common construction technique\nin the world. It is a sustainable, easy and economical construction\nmethod, but its share of the construction market has\ndecreased in recent decades (Salmanpour et al., 2015). This is\ndue to the availability of new construction techniques. Even\nFigure 1. Undamaged view of the Hüsrev Pasha Mosque and social\ncomplex.\nthough many constructions techniques have been developed\nand used in the last century, almost all historical structures\nall over the world made up of unreinforced masonry (Chisari\net al., 2015).\nIn the course of time masonry structures have been affected\nheavily by natural and man-made disasters. However,\none of the most destructive factors is earthquakes. Earthquakes\ncreate horizontal load and cause tensile stress in ma-\nsonry structures, which have very low tensile strength. Therefore,\nit is of vital importance to investigate the earthquake\nbehavior of the masonry structures.\nEarthquake behavior of masonry structures are related to\nsome parameters such as material properties, shape of structure,\nsupport and load situations. In addition to these, an-\nother important factor exists in masonry structures, namely\nthe openings in masonry walls. It is commonly accepted that\nthe presence of openings reduces the lateral stiffness and\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n', '1812 A. C.

However,\nthere is still debate over how the openings are located\nin the systems and how openings affect the earthquake behavior\nof the system. There have been few studies performed\nby researchers about this subject. In the Turkish Earthquake\nCode (TEC, 2007) there is some information about openings\nin masonry, but it is very limited.\nThere are many studies in the literature about historical\nmasonry structures. Almost every aspect of the subject\nhas been examined experimentally and numerically. Historical\nmasonry arch bridges (Milani and Lourenço, 2012; Al-\ntunisik et al., 2015), towers (Peña et al., 2010), minarets and\nmosques (Seker et al., 2014), churches (Brandonisio et al.,\n2013), buildings and walls (Shariq et al., 2008; Lin et al.,\n2012; Parisi et al., 2013), and chimneys (Minghini et al.,\n2014) have all been investigated by different authors. Very\nrigid structures such as castles, fortresses and bastions have\nbeen investigated in terms of static and dynamic structural\nbehavior (Betti et al., 2011; Tiberti et al., 2016).\nMosques, which have a beautiful appearance and high religious\nvalue, are very important for Muslims. Many mosques\nhave been built in Muslims area, and most of them were built\nwith masonry techniques. There are many masonry mosques\nin Turkey, and most of these mosques are in seismic zones.\nThe presence of earthquakes in Turkey has caused damage\nto and at times the destruction of masonry mosques. Additionally,\nthe Hüsrev Pasha Mosque, which was located in an\nactive seismic zone, was damaged by some seismic events.\nIn the restoration of the Hüsrev Pasha Mosque, the reduction\nof window openings on the dome to improve the structural\nNat.

For this purpose, the restora-\ntion effect also reduction of window openings effect on the\nearthquake response of masonry mosques are investigated in\nthis paper.\n2 Hüsrev Pasha Mosque\nThe Hüsrev Pasha Mosque is located in the Ortakapı district\nin the old city of Van, Turkey. The mosque was built by Koca\nHüsrev Mehmed Pasha, who was the governor of Van and\nvizier of Suleiman the Magnificent. The mosque was conFigure\n5. Maximum displacements contour diagram of the mosque\nwith 16 window openings under dead load and earthquake load in\nthe x direction (G+EX).\nstructed by the famous Turkish architect Mimar Sinan between\n1567 and 1568.\nThe mosque has one big dome and five small domes. The\nbig and the small domes covered the central prayer area\n(“nave”) and porch respectively. The mean prayer area has\na 15.00×15.20m geometric shape, and the walls which surround\nthis area are 2 m thick. The walls consist of cut stone\nand rough stones, and transition elements and domes consist\nof bricks material. Limestone was used for bonding in the\nwalls. The mosque has a minaret which has a square shape\nbase and cylindrical body. Originally, there were china ornaments\non the walls up to a 2 m height and pencil art on the\ndome in the mosque, but most this art and these decorations\nno longer exist today. Exterior parts of the mosque have colorful\nstonemasonry, namely red–white stones up to underside\nof windows and black–white stones on the rest of the walls\nwith red ribbons. There is an historical inscription above the\nmosque’s door.\nThe mosque is located in an active seismic region classified\nas a second degree earthquake zone in the seismic zoning\nmap which was published by the Ministry of Public Works\nwww.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/17/1811/2017/ Nat.

Because of this characteristic,\nthe mosque has been damaged severely by earthquakes.\nThe mosque and social complex which had stood for centuries\nwere damaged by the 1839 earthquake and fire. Af-\nter this unfortunate event the complex was restored. During\nWorld War I the complex and mosque were vandalized heavily.\nIn addition to these events, the complex and mosque were\nruined by the 2011 Van earthquakes. The minaret and last\nprayer area were heavily damaged in these earthquakes. Today\nthe prayer area and shrine are structurally sound, but the\nrest of the complex is highly damaged or has been destroyed.\nFor this reason the mosque was closed for praying, and the\naim of the restoration project is to open the mosque for praying.\nUndamaged views of the mosque are given in Fig. 1.\nToday there are some influences which detrimentally affect\nthe structural performance of the mosque. These influ-\nences are structural cracks, material deformations, destroyed\nparts of the carrier system, and environmental issues (e.g., algae\nand humidity). Some views of these influences and dam-\naged views of the mosque are shown in Fig. 2.\n3 Structural analysis of the mosque\nFinite element analyses were performed to investigate the\nrestoration effect on the earthquake behavior of the mosque,\nconsidering different opening ratios on the dome. The model\nwas designed using restoration drawings considering 8 and\n16 openings on the dome. Finite element models of the\nmosque were created with SAP2000 software (SAP2000,\n2015). The earthquake ground motions have three components,\nin the x, y and z directions, which were analyzed to\nbetter comprehend the restoration effect with different openings\non the dome, and the results were compared to evaluate\nthe structural response of the mosque. After analyses of maximum\ndisplacements, maximum–minimum principal stresses\nand shear stresses were obtained, and the results are given\nwith contour diagrams. Structural analyses of the mosque\nwith 16 and 8 window openings are listed below:\n– Modal analysis of the mosque.\n– Dead load and earthquake load (x, y, z direction).\nFinite element models of the mosque were designed using\nframe, area and 3-D solid elements in the SAP2000 program.\nThe bar, area and 3-D solid elements have 2, 4 and 12 nodes\nrespectively, and each node has three degrees of freedom.\nLinear elastic methods cannot give exact solutions in the\nstructural analyses of historical masonry structures which are\nbuilt using bricks and stones. Despite that, nonlinear analyses\ncan give exact results if the material properties of ma-\nsonry are defined in the analyses correctly. However, if the\nanalyzed structures are very large and complex, there could\nbe some problems in the iterations in nonlinear analyses. Additionally,\ndefining the material properties of masonry struc-\ntures is fairly difficult because of their non-homogeneity. For\nthese reasons all analyses were performed using a linear elastic\nmethod. Material properties which were used in the anal-\nyses are given with Table 1.\nFinite element analyses results, displacement, section effect\nand stress values were controlled by considering the al-\nlowed values in the 2007 Turkish Earthquake Code (TEC,\n2007; chap. 5.3, Pressure Safety Stresses of Walls in which\nFree Pressure Strength is Unknown). Safety stresses for the\nHüsrev Pasha Mosque are given in Table 2.\nThe mode superposition method was used in earthquake\nanalyses, and the elastic behavior of the mosque under vertical\nand earthquake loads was obtained with using the full\nsquare consolidation method. The spectral acceleration coefficient\nwas taken as S(T )= 2.5, and the effective earth-\nquake coefficient was chosen as Ao = 0.3 for related the region\nwhich is in the second seismic zone. In masonry struc-\ntures, when the tension stresses surpasses the tension strength\nof the material, cracks and weakening occur. This situation is\ntaken into consideration in the analyses by using the earthquake\nload reduction coefficient (Ra) in each period. No\nreduction was performed in this study (Ra = 1), but safety\nstresses are increased 3 times.\nThe Hüsrev Pasha Mosque was not built considering any\nbuilding code; it was built using experience. There are some\nrules about openings for masonry in the Turkish Earthquake\nCode (2007). When the mosque is assessed and these rules\nare considered, there is no discrepancy with the code. Some\nof the rules that exist in the code regarding openings for masonry\nrelated to this study are given below (TEC, 2007):\n– The plan length of the solid masonry wall which is between\nthe corner of a building and the nearest window\nor door opening shall not be less than 1.50 m for the\nwww.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/17/1811/2017/ Nat.

The finite element model of the\nmosque with eight window openings is shown in Fig. 17.\nUsing the modal analysis, the first four natural frequencies\nwere obtained, with values of 3.81, 3.87, 4.81 and 5.78 Hz\nrespectively. Mode shapes were obtained as translation in the\nx direction, translation in the y direction, squeeze and torsion\nrespectively. Results of earthquake analyses are given in\nTable 3.\n4 Conclusions\nIn this study the restoration effect on the earthquake behavior\nof masonry mosques is investigated considering different\nopening ratios on the dome. As a result of the study, the following\nobservations were made:\n– Reductions of window openings caused an increase in\nthe frequencies. This situation shows that the reduction\nof window openings affects the structural performance\nand stability of the mosque positively.\n– When the stress results are examined, it is seen that the\ncompression and shear stresses values do not exceed\nthe recommended compression and shear stresses values\nfor masonry structures in the Turkish Earthquake\nCode (2007).\n– Tension stresses occurred near the openings, bottom of\nwalls and under the dome areas locally for each case.\n– Compression stresses, tension stresses and shear\nstresses collect on some critical areas, especially near\nopenings and crossing points; because of this, those areas\nmust be monolithically rebuilt in the restoration pro-\ncess. Fibre-reinforced polymer composite strengthening\ncan be used to resist the tension stresses in restoration\napplications.\n– According to the results, the displacement, compression,\ntension and shear stresses decrease when the open-\nings are reduced.\nConsequently, the reduction of window openings ensures the\nintegrity of the walls, so this situation supports the structural\nperformance of the mosque. It is seen from the study that\nrestoration applications, especially reduction of the window\nopenings on the dome, improve the earthquake response of\nthe mosque.\nData availability.
