        <pre>['CURRENT DOCUMENTS\nThe Lusaka Manifesto\nAt the fifth summit conference of East and Central African states, held \nin Lusaka, Zambia, on April 14-16,1969, the Organization of African Unity \nissued a statement on Southern Africa known as the Lusaka Manifesto. Ex\xad\ncerpts from the manifesto follow:\nWe, the leaders of East and Central African \nStates meeting at Lusaka, 16 April 1969, have \nagreed to issue this Manifesto. . . .\nWe wish to make clear . . . our acceptance of \nthe belief that all men are equal, and have equal \nrights to human dignity and respect, regardless of \ncolour, race, religion, or sex. We believe that all \nmen have the right and the duty to participate, \nas equal members of the society, in their own gov\xad\nernment. We do not accept that any individual \nor group has any right to govern any other group \nof sane adults, without their consent, and we af\xad\nfirm that only the people of a society, acting to\xad\ngether as equals, can determine what is, for them, \na good society and a good social, economic, or \npolitical organization.\nOn the basis of these beliefs we do not accept \nthat any one group within a society has the right \nto rule any society without the continuing consent \nof all the citizens. We recognize that at any one \ntime there will be, within every society, failures in \nthe implementation of these ideals. We recognize \nthat for the sake of order in human affairs, there \nmay be transitional arrangements while a trans\xad\nformation from group inequalities to individual \nequality is being effected. But we affirm that \nwithout an acceptance of these ideals—without a \ncommitment to these principles of human equal\xad\nity and self-determination-—there can be no basis \nfor peace and justice in the world. . . .\nIt is on the basis of our commitment to human \nequality and human dignity, not on the basis of \nachieved perfection, that we take our stand of hos\xad\ntility towards the colonialism and racial discrimina\xad\ntion which is being practised in Southern Africa. \nIt is on the basis of their commitment to these uni\xad\nversal principles that we appeal to other members \nof the human race for support.\nIf the commitment to these principles existed \namong the states holding power in Southern Africa, \nany disagreements we might have about the rate of \nimplementation, or about isolated acts of policy, \nwould be matters affecting only our individual rela\xad\ntionships with the States concerned. . . .\n[But] in Mozambique, Angola, Rhodesia, South\nWest Africa, and the Union of South Africa, there \nis an open and continued denial of the principles \nof human equality and national self-determination. \nThis is not a matter of failure in the implementa\xad\ntion of accepted human principles. The effective \nadministrations in all these territories are not strug\xad\ngling towards these difficult goals. They are fight\xad\ning the principles; they are deliberately organizing \ntheir societies so as to try to destroy the hold of \nthese principles in the minds of men. It is for this \nreason that we believe the rest of the world must be \ninterested. For the principle of human equality, \nand all that flows from it, is either universal or it \ndoes not exist. The dignity of all men is destroyed \nwhen the manhood of any human being is denied.\nOur objectives in Southern Africa stem from our \ncommitment to this principle of human equality. \nWe are not hostile to the administrations of these \nstates because they are manned and controlled by \nwhite people. We are hostile to them because they \narc systems of minority control which exist as a \nresult of, and in the pursuance of, doctrines of \nhuman inequality. What we are working for is \nthe right of self-determination for the people of \nthose territories. We are working for a rule in \nthose countries which is based on the will of all the \npeople, and an acceptance of the equality of every \ncitizen.. . .\nThis is why the signatory states participate in the \nmovement for the liberation of Africa under the \naegis of the Organization of African Unity. How\xad\never, the obstacle to change is not the same in all \nthe countries of Southern Africa, and it follows \ntherefore that the possibility of continuing the \nstruggle through peaceful means varies from one \ncountry to another.\nIn Mozambique and Angola, and in so called \nPortuguese Guinea, the basic problem is not ra\xad\ncialism but a pretence that Portugal exists in \nAfrica. Portugal is situated in Europe; the fact \nthat it is a dictatorship is a matter for the Portu\xad\nguese to settle. But no decree of the Portuguese \ndictator, nor legislation passed by any Parliament \nin Portugal, can make Africa part of Europe. \nThe only thing which could convert a part of\n173\n', '174 C U RREN T H ISTORY, M ARCH, 1970\nAfrica into a constituent unit in a union which \nalso includes a European state would be the freely \nexpressed will of the people of that part of Africa. \nThere is no such popular will in the Portuguese \ncolonies. On the contrary, in the absence of any \nopportunity to negotiate a road to freedom, the \npeoples of all three territories have taken up arms \nagainst the colonial power. They have done this \ndespite the heavy odds against them, and despite \nthe great suffering they know to be involved.\nThe peoples of Mozambique, Angola and Portu\xad\nguese Guinea . . . are interested in their freedom. \nThey are demanding an acceptance of the prin\xad\nciples of independence on the basis of majority rule, \nand for many years they called for discussions on \nthis issue. Only when their demand for talks was \ncontinually ignored did they begin to fight. Even \nnow, if Portugal should change her policy and ac\xad\ncept the principle of self-determination, we would \nurge the liberation movements to desist from their \narmed struggle and to cooperate in the mechanics \nof a peaceful transfer of power from Portugal to the \npeoples of the African territories. . . .\nIn Rhodesia the situation is different insofar as \nthe metropolitan power has acknowledged the co\xad\nlonial status of the territory. Unfortunately, how\xad\never, it has failed to take adequate measures to re\xad\nassert its authority against the minority which has \nseized power with the declared intention of main\xad\ntaining white domination. The matter cannot rest \nthere. Rhodesia, like the rest of Africa, must be \nfree, and its independence must be on the basis of \nmajority rule. If the colonial power is unwilling \nor unable to effect such a transfer of power to the \npeople, then the people themselves will have no al\xad\nternative but to capture it as and when they can. \nAnd Africa has no alternative but to support them. \nThe question which remains in Rhodesia is there\xad\nfore whether Britain will re-assert her authority in \nRhodesia and then negotiate the peaceful progress \nto majority rule before independence. Insofar as \nBritain is willing to make this second commitment, \nAfrica will co-operate in her attempts to re-assert \nher authority. This is the method of progress \nwhich we would prefer; it could involve less suffer\xad\ning for all the peoples of Rhodesia, both black and \nwhite. But until there is some firm evidence that \nBritain accepts the principles of independence on \nthe basis of majority rule, and is prepared to take \nwhatever steps are necessary to make it a reality, \nthen Africa has no choice but to support the strug\xad\ngle for the people’s freedom by whatever means are \nopen.\nJust as a settlement of the Rhodesian problem \nwith a minimum of violence is a British respon\xad\nsibility, so a  settlement in South West Africa with \na minimum of violence is a United Nations respon\xad\nsibility. By every canon of international law, \nand by every precedent, South West Africa should \nhave been now a sovereign, independent state with\na government based on majority rule. South West \nAfrica was a German colony until 1919, just as \nTanganyika, Rwanda and Burundi, Togoland and \nCameroon were German colonies. I t was a mat\xad\nter of European politics that when the mandatory \nsystem was established after Germany had been \ndefeated, the administration of South West Africa \nwas given to the white minority Government of \nSouth Africa, while the other ex-German colonies \nin Africa were put into the hands of the British, \nBelgian or French governments. After the Second \nWorld War every mandated territory except South \nWest Africa was converted into a trusteeship terri\xad\ntory and has subsequently gained independence. \nSouth Africa, on the other hand, has persistently \nrefused to honour even the international obligation \nit accepted in 1919, and has increasingly applied \nto South West Africa the inhuman doctrines and \norganization of apartheid.\nThe United Nations General Assembly has ruled \nagainst this action, and in 1966 terminated the \nmandate under which South Africa had a legal \nbasis for its occupation and domination of South \nAfrica. The General Assembly declared that the \nterritory is now the direct responsibility of the \nUnited Nations, and set up an ad hoc committee to \nrecommend practical means by which South West \nAfrica would be administered, and the people en\xad\nabled to exercise self-determination and to achieve \nindependence.\nNothing could be clearer than this decision, \nwhich no permanent member of the Security \nCouncil voted against. Yet, since that time no \neffective measures have been taken to enforce it. \nSouth West Africa remains in the clutches of the \nmost ruthless minority government in Africa. Its \npeople continue to be oppressed, and those who \nadvocate even peaceful progress to independence \ncontinue to be persecuted. . . .\nThe Union of South Africa is itself an indepen\xad\ndent, sovereign State and a member of the United \nNations. It is more highly developed and richer \nthan any other nation in Africa. On every legal \nbasis its internal affairs are a matter exclusively for \nthe people of South Africa. Yet, the purpose of \nlaw is people and we assert that the actions of the \nSouth African government are such that the rest \nof the world has a responsibility to take some action \nin defence of humanity.\nThere is one thing about South African oppres\xad\nsion which distinguishes it from other oppressive \nregimes. The apartheid policy adopted and sup\xad\nported by its government is based on a rejection \nof man’s humanity. A position of privilege or the \nexperience of oppression in the South African so\xad\nciety depends on the one thing which it is beyond \nthe power of any man to change. It depends upon \na man’s colour, his parentage and his ancestors. \nIf you are black you cannot escape this categorisa\xad\ntion, nor can you escape it if you are white. If you\n', 'Current Documents • 175\nare a  black millionaire and a brilliant political \nscientist, you are still subject to the pass laws, and \nstill excluded from political activity. If you are \nwhite, even protests against the system and an at\xad\ntempt to reject segregation, will lead you only to \nthe segregation and the comparative comfort of a \nwhite jail. Beliefs, abilities, and behavior are all \nirrelevant to a man’s status; everything depends \nupon race. Manhood is irrelevant. The whole \nsystem of government and society in South Africa \nis based on the denial of human equality. And the \nsystem is maintained by a ruthless denial of the \nhuman rights of the majority of the population and \nthus, inevitably of alL . . .\nSOUTH AFRICA AND THE \nWIND OF CHANGE \n(Continued from page 169)\nposed problems to which such a policy was \nthe only feasible answer.\nWhat of the African neighbors? How \nmuch choice did Lesotho, Botswana and \nSwaziland have when they became independ\xad\nent? The answer must be: very little. This \nunderlines what is surely the major factor \ngoverning this group of states in southern \nAfrica, namely, the central and dominant \nplace of the South African economy. I t is \nno exaggeration to maintain that the hold \nof the South African economy over the \nformer High Commission Territories is nearly \ncomplete and, with regard to Rhodesia, Moz\xad\nambique and Malawi, is large even disregard\xad\ning for the moment the present special de\xad\npendence of Rhodesia because of United Na\xad\ntions sanctions.\nIn the first place, three of them depend \non the export of their labor to South Africa. \nFor example, it would seem that only 5 per \ncent of Lesotho’s total male labor force of \nabout 265,000 can find employment in the \ncountry. At any time, about 164,000 are \nemployed in the South African Republic. In \naddition, some 20,000-30,000 women are \nemployed in South Africa. The annual re\xad\nmittances are estimated at Rand 5,400,000 \nin cash (Rand = $1.40) and R2,000,000 in \nkind. Without this, Lesotho, a country of \napproximately one million inhabitants, could \nnot survive. The aid from Britain for the\nfive years 1967-1972 is estimated at about \nR5,000,000 to R6,000,000. In 1967, Bot\xad\nswana, with a population of about 400,000, \nhad some 32,000 to 33,000 men in South \nAfrica working in the mines and some 8,000 \nother workers employed in domestic service \nthere. Swaziland is not dependent on her \nexport of labor but some 44 per cent of her \nland is worked under concessions and free \nhold and her mines and industries are de\xad\npendent on South African capital.\nBotli Mozambique and Malawi export \nlabor to Rhodesia and South Africa. Some \n80,000 Malawians find employment in South \nAfrica in mines served by the Witwatersrand \nNative Labour Association. According to the \nFroneman Committee of Inquiry, in Sep\xad\ntember, 1960, there were some 836,000 for\xad\neign Africans in South Africa including; \nwomen and dependents. On December l l r\n1969, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and \nSwaziland signed a new agreement continu\xad\ning the 1910 customs union among them \nwhich was due to terminate after 60 years in\n1970. This reminds us that they also have \na common currency.\nThe conclusion is inescapable. The four \nAfrican states are poor, landlocked and un\xad\nderdeveloped. They depend upon South \nAfrica’s good will. And this has been forth\xad\ncoming from both government and private \nsources. Swaziland has concluded an agree\xad\nment with the South African government \naccording to which, upon request, South \nAfrica will recruit, pay and equip South \nAfricans to serve in Swaziland’s local ad\xad\nministration. South African engineers have \nbeen assisting in plans for the development \nof Swaziland’s broadcasting services. In \nOctober, 1969, a South African parliamen\xad\ntary delegation led by the Speaker of the \nHouse of Assembly visited Malawi. This was \nthe first such delegation to visit an independ\xad\nent African state. In addition to the loan \ntowards the building of Malawi’s new capital \nat Lilongwe, South African assistance is in\xad\nvolved in the new railway line which will \njoin the Portuguese line in Mozambique, thus \nproviding Malawi with another outlet to the \n(Continued on page 192)\n']</pre>
