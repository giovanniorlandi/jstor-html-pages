"\nThe Tonopah and Tidewater rail\nroad parallels one side of the dis\ntrict, while the Las Vegas and To\nnopah road covers the opposite side.\nThe interest of the Santa Fe com\npany arises because of its connec\ntion with the former line.\nThe most optimistic predictions\nare made by J.

And then there is a pe\nculiar property in the soil which\nfurnishes a production that has a\nflavoring superior to anything grown\nelsewhere.

A strong contingent of\nSalt Lake mining men with faith in\nthe Pioche district, and this prop\nerty in particular, has secured an\noption on the control, and within a\nfew days exoect to inaugurate work\non the property, the ultimate object\nbeing to make of the Demijohn one\nof the leading properties of the dis\ntrict.\nThe Pioche-Demljohn is incorpor\nated for 1.000.000 shares, with\n200,000 shares in the treasury. At\nleast half of the treasury stock will\nbe taken at such figures as to pro\nvide, a working fund sufficient to\ncarry the present workings into the\nlarger productive territory. An am\nple working fund is already prac\ntically assured for this purpose.\nThere Is now a 200-foot shaft on\nthe property." This will be carried\ndown probably 200 feet deeper, the\nobject being to get into the under\nlying second bed of shale, and fin\nally into the quartzite, where big,\npermanent bodies of ore are antici\npated. This second shale tone in\nthe Prince has proven productive\nterritory, but eminent engineers and\nmineralogists who know the camp\nthoroughly say that the quartzite\nwhich the Prince has not yet pene\ntrated will be the great ore bearing\nzone, .\nThe Demijohn has produced con\nsiderable ore from the surface down\nto the 200 level, the lowest depths\nyet attained. The great Yuba dike\ncuts through the property, and this\nis generally acknowledged to be the\nmother vein and great mineralizing\nagency of the Pioche district.\nOne of the main movers in the\nscheme to finance and develop the\nDemijohn, when seen yesterday, ad\nmitted the foregoing as being sub\nstantially correct, adding: -\'If our\nplans carry out as at present out\nlined, we expect to make a mine of\nDemijohn, and will, by thorough\nmining, make the stock worth a\ngreat deal more than the price at\nwhich it Is quoted today."\nIn reference to the Demijohn the\nK. K. Cobb circular says:\nFrom surface indications and\nfrom the peculiar geological fea\ntures, there Is perhaps no property\nin the Pioche district which holds\nout greater promise than the Demi\nJohn. A vein of ore from one to\nfour feet in width has been fol\ni lowed from the surface for a hun\ndred feet on a dip of 45 degrees to\nthe westward. This vein carries\nrich values In silver, lead and gold\nAfter following this vein far enough\nto assure themselves of consistency\nin size and values, the company\nsank a vertical working shaft, cut\nting the vein on the 100-foot level,\nand continuing on to the 200 level\nare now crosscutting to catch the\nporphyry dikes which are marked\nIn this property by conditions most\nfavorable to rich mieralization.\nA car of 50 tons of ore averng\ning 1100 to the ton, is ready for\nshipment, and approximately 10,000\ntons of commercial ores of lower\ngrade is In sight.\nNot only the porphyry dike on\nthe Assuring of the Pioche Klug\nand Golden Prince, but the Yuba\ndike on the Assuring of the old\nmines runs through the Demijohn\nproperty, Intersecting almost in the\ncenter of the group. This group\nwhich consists of eight claims, all\npatented, covers HO acros of\nwith the Golden "Prince, Insures ?\nlarge body of commercial ore, while\nthe Yuba dike holds out promise o\nAssuring of the bonanza type. lu\nfact some of the large free samples\nof ore in the vein opened, pssay as\nhigh as 600 ounces silver, 70 per\ncent lead and $25 in gold.\nThe combination of these two\nsources of mineralization marks the\nPioche-Demljohn as one of the\nbright lights, of what is destined to\nbe the greatest silver-lead camp In\nthe world.\nNOTICE TO CREDITORS\nNotice is hereby given that De\ncember 10th, 1910, at 10 o\'clock a\nm., in the court room of the First\njudicial district court for Nevada,\nin and for Ormsby county, at the\ncourt house, Carson City, Nevada,\nbefore the Hon.

Richardson and Mrs. Emma\nK. Wright were married by Jus\ntice of the Peace Davis, at the home\nof the bride in Second street.\nMrs. Wright received her divorce\non September 3, when she left for\nNew York on a short trip to wind\nup her affairs in the east. Her\nfather also went to New York with\nher and is expected back in Reno\nsoon. :\nMr. Richardson filed his com\nplaint on October 20, received an\nanswer and was awarded a decree\ncn September 3. He has been a\nresident of Nevada for several\nyears, being identified with various\nmining interests throughout the\nstate.\nA peculiar feature of Mrs.\nWright\'s quick marriage after being\ndivorced from E. S. Mendels Is the\nfact that she was allowed to resume\nher maiden name when her divorce\nwas granted. She has a chile and\nit is not customary for the maiden\nname to be restored under such cir\ncumstances. She stated on the wit\nness stand, however, that neither\nshe nor her son wished to bear the\nname of Mendels.\nThe former wife of Richardson\nwas Edna McClure, the well known\nbeauty and actress of New York\nShe has the custody of their two\nchildren, and Richardson is paying\nalimony. His father is a prominent\nWall street broker and the young\nman has offices in First street In\nthe Theatre building.\nRichardson "gave his age as 31\nand his bride\'s as 25. Both claimed\nReno as their residence and they\nwill occupy the Thomas property at\nthe .corner of Second and Ralston\nstreets. This is the cottage in\nwhich it was rumored that Mrs.\nVanderbilt would live when it was\nexpected that she would come to\nReno to establish a residence for\nsuit for divorce.\nSTOCK MARKET\nThe following quotations were\nfurnished the Bonanza by H.
