The duties of the\'\ncommission are to put this law\nin operation and devise rules and\nregulations for carrying out its\nprovisions. With this object in J\nvic-v the state entomologist, act-*“^\ning under the authority vested\nin him by this commission, has\nappointed L E. Reynolds local\ninspector of orchards and other\npremises in Wood county.\nSan Jose scale, peach yellows,\nand black knot have bean for\nyears exacting their toil from\nthe orchards in nearly all parts\nof the state, and now comes the\n‘cedar rust” of the apple, a com\nparatively new trouble, at least\nin so far as its destructive abun\ndance is concerned, which is\ncausing great damage to the ap\nple crop wherever the disease has\nestablished itself on the red ce\ndar.\nIt has been demonstrated that\nthis disease has two host plants,\nnamely: the red cedar and the\napple tree. That portion of the\nlife cycye of the trouble passed\non the red cedar trees is known\nas “cedar bait” or “cedar ap\nples,” and when living on the\napple tree it is called rust, or\ncedar rust, Spraying for the\nrust has not proven a satisfacto\nry means of control, and since\nthe trouble cannot propogate it\nself without the presence of both\nthe red cedar and the apple\ntrees, the cry “down with the\nred cedars’, has become the\nwatchword in the apple growing\nsections of the state. It seems\nthat this slogan must be carried\nout to the letter if West Virgin\nia is to stand in the front ranks\nas an apple growing state.\nStory From Missouri\nTwo close fisted Missouri\nbrothers sued a neighbor for\n$372 owing on a land deal.
