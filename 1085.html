Though the proportions of South Africa's current \norganised crime problem is daunting and threatening,1 law enforcement measures \nthreatening individual rights must withstand vigilant constitutional scrutiny lest South \nAfrica's transition entail a shift from one oppressive regime to another. At the root of \nthe tension pertaining to criminal asset forfeiture are certain principles which are \ngenerally accepted in societies that embrace liberal democratic values. These are the \nright to private property, which encompasses that the state may seize property only \nin terms of a law of general application; criminal guilt must be shown beyond a \nreasonable doubt; the guilty may be punished only by the state; and all should be \ntreated equally before the law.2 In this article it is submitted that in circumstances \nwhere criminal asset forfeiture is employed as a law enforcement tool, the fulfilment \nby the state of its public responsibility ultimately results in a conflict between its \npublic responsibility and its responsibility to respect the individual rights of persons \nwhose property are subjected to asset forfeiture proceedings. \nAlthough criminal asset forfeiture is seen as the newly emerged tool for controlling \ncriminal behaviour in the twenty-first century, it is said to have been in existence \neven during biblical times as a penal or a remedial action.3 The benefits of criminal \nasset forfeiture are indisputable.

This is of vital importance in \nSouth Africa, a country intensely threatened by organised crime.4  \n2 Requirements and substantive legal provisions for criminal asset \nforfeiture \n2.1 The restraint stage \nIn South Africa the restraint stage of criminal forfeiture proceedings involves the \ngranting5 of a restraint order, which prohibits any person affected by the order from \ndealing in any manner with the property to which it applies.6 The restraint order is \ngranted over realisable property,7 which includes any property held by the defendant \nconcerned, as well as any property held by any third party who may have received \naffected gifts from the defendant.  \nSections 25 and 26 of POCA provide for the making of a restraint application and an \norder prior to or subsequent to a conviction. Such an application may be brought by \nthe NDPP on behalf of the state ex parte, at a High Court, for an order prohibiting \nany person from dealing in any manner with any property to which the restraint \norder relates.8 In cases where there are victims, the state relies on their affidavits in \nsupport of the application. The short-term purpose of a restraint order is to preserve \nproperty9 which in due course will be realised in satisfaction of a confiscation order.10 \nIn the long term it provides for a recovery mechanism for the proceeds of unlawful \nactivities.11 A court granting a restraint order may, amongst other directions, appoint \n                                        \n4  Shereda 1997 Geo Wash J Int'l L & Econ 297. \n5  Only High Courts can grant restraint orders. See further Keightley Asset Forfeiture 36-39. \n6  S 26 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121 of 1998 (hereafter referred to as \n POCA or the Prevention of Organised Crime Act). \n7  Ss 26-29 of POCA. Property is referred to in s 14 of the POCA. The category of realisable \nproperty is widely framed and extends beyond property owned by the defendant. It is therefore \npossible to obtain a restraint order over property which is technically owned by someone else, \nprovided that the defendant has an interest in it. The wide ambit of realisable property is \nnecessary in order to deal with criminals who in an effort to protect and conceal their property \nplace it in the name of third parties and family members.  \n8 S 26(1) of POCA. \n9 This may, in terms of s 26(2) of POCA, include property specified in the restraint order and held \nby a defendant, or unspecified property held by a defendant, and all property transferred by a \ndefendant to another person after the order was made. \n10 NDPP v Kyriacou 2003 2 SACR 524 (SCA). \n11 NDPP v Rautenbach 2005 1 SACR 530 (SCA). \n", 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1050 \na curator from private practice12 to take charge of the property; order any person to \nsurrender the property to the curator; authorise the police to assist the curator in \nseizing the property; and place restrictions upon the encumbering or transferring of \nimmovable property.13  \nIt is submitted that, in the light of the fact that once a restraint order is granted or is \nconfirmed, prior to a conviction, absent requirements for variation or rescission laid \ndown in section 26(10)(a) of POCA, a restraint order is not capable of being \nchanged, and thus the defendant is stripped of the restrained assets and any control \nor use of them, and therefore pending the conclusion of the trial or the confiscation \nproceedings he is remediless. This has grave constitutional consequences which will \nbe expounded upon in chapter 6 of this article. The period from the date of granting \nthe restraint order to the granting of a confiscation order may be a very lengthy \nperiod which may take months or years. In current times criminal cases are known \nto be postponed several times.14 Where a defendant decides to appeal a conviction \nor sentence, the period of being "remediless" may be far longer.15 Where the curator \nremoves a defendant\'s property for storage, the costs related thereto are likely to be \nhuge and the condition of the property may deteriorate, if not properly maintained, \nover such a long period. This could have an adverse impact on the defendant\'s \nfinancial position, which would inevitably have a profound effect on his human rights \ndetailed in the Bill of Rights. \nThe NDPP does not have to establish a threat of dissipation of property in order to \nobtain a restraint order.16 The inherent purpose of a restraint order is to preserve \nproperty on the premise that there is a strong possibility that the property in \nquestion may be realised in satisfaction of a confiscation order.17 The restraint order \nensures that property is preserved so that the property might in due course be \n                                        \n12 It is essential that a curator should not be attached to the state and must comply with the \nrequirements of the Administration of Estates Act 66 of 1965 (as amended). \n13  Part 3 of Ch 5 of POCA. \n14 ABSA Bank Ltd v Fraser (CC) unreported case number 66/05 of 15 December 2006 para 11-12. \n15  Phillips v NDPP 2003 2 SACR 410 (SCA) 414. \n16  NDPP v Phillips 2002 4 SA 60 (W). \n17  NDPP v Rautenbach 2005 1 SACR 530 (SCA). \n', "V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1051 \nrealised in satisfaction of a confiscation order.18 The property which is restrained is \nheld as security against the confiscation order which is anticipated.19 This means that \nrealisable property is not necessarily limited to property which is tainted by the \nalleged offence.20 Property which was legitimately acquired by the defendant may \nalso be restrained.21 The latter principle is also applicable to the legitimate property \nof a third party who received an affected gift from a defendant, because such \nproperty is realisable property, and it may be subject to realisation in satisfaction of \na confiscation order granted against a defendant.22 It is submitted that this stance of \nPOCA is constitutionally questionable because it essentially amounts to the arbitrary \ndeprivation of legitimate property. A restraint order may be made over property \nspecified in the restraint order or over all the realisable property of a defendant, \nirrespective of whether it is specified in the restraint order or not.23 In addition it \nmay also be made over property which will be transferred to the defendant in the \nfuture.24 Thus, where a restraint order is appropriate the NDPP may seek to restrain \nall of the defendant's assets, including unknown assets, and in addition may request \nthe court to order the defendant to divulge the whereabouts and all relevant details \nof any unknown assets.  \nFurthermore, even before a criminal prosecution has been instituted the NDPP may \napply for a restraint order. However it is a jurisdictional requisite that if the \nprosecution against the defendant has not yet been instituted the court must be \nsatisfied that the defendant is to be charged with an offence.25 The prosecution need \nnot be imminent nor is a charge sheet a prerequisite for the latter jurisdictional \nrequisite.26 The NDPP must set out its case in such a manner that the defendant is \n                                        \n18  NDPP v Rebuzzi 2002 1 SACR 128 (SCA). \n19  NDPP v Rebuzzi 2002 1 SACR 128 (SCA). \n20  NDPP v Rebuzzi 2002 1 SACR 128 (SCA). \n21  NDPP v Rebuzzi 2002 1 SACR 128 (SCA). \n22  S 32 of POCA. \n23  S 26(2) of POCA. \n24  S 26(2) of POCA.  \n25  S 25(1)(b)(i) of POCA. \n26  S 25(1)(b)(i) of POCA. \n", 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1052 \nfairly informed of the case that he or she is called upon to meet, but that does not \nmean that it must be presented in any particular form.27  \nIt is submitted that there is no apparent reason why POCA does not contain a \nspecific provision which spells out clearly the details of the case. This practice has \nthe potential for the abuse of the defendant\'s rights. It is submitted that the \ndefendant should be given full details as to why such an action against him is being \ncontemplated on the basis of the fundamental rights he enjoys in terms of the \nConstitution, such as the right to privacy. Furthermore, it is a jurisdictional \nrequirement that it must appear to the court that there are reasonable grounds for \nbelieving that a confiscation order "may" be made against the defendant.28 This \nmeans that a court considering an application for a restraint order is required to \nassess what "may" occur in the future, that is, whether the criminal court "may" \nconvict the defendant and whether it "may" find that the defendant benefitted from \nthe relevant criminal offences or criminal activities related thereto. It is submitted \nthat such a practice is constitutionally questionable because the basis for the \ndeprivation of the defendant\'s rights is weak. \nIt is also submitted that there is uncertainty regarding what the standard of \n"reasonable grounds for believing" entails. A restraint order can be made only once \nthe NDPP "has discharged the onus of showing a reasonable prospect of obtaining \nboth a conviction in respect of some or all of the charges levelled against the \naccused person and a subsequent confiscation order".29 Where there are multiple \ncharges, the NDPP will have to show that the defendant could derive a benefit from \nthe offences with which he or she is charged.30 The court making the restraint order \ndoes not have to determine that the offences were probably committed. The court \nneed only determine that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a court \n                                        \n27  NDPP v Rautenbach 2005 SACR 530 (SCA) 541. \n28  Ss 25(1)(a)(ii) and 25(1)(b)(ii) of POCA.  \n29  NDPP v Tam 2004 1 SACR 126 (W). \n30  NDPP v Tam 2004 1 SACR 126 (W). \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1053 \nmight find that the offences were committed.31 This is a "comparatively light onus of \nproof on the NDPP".32  \nIn NDPP v Kyriakou,33 it was held that the reasonable grounds for believing standard \ndid not require the NDPP to factually prove that a confiscation order will be made, \nand therefore there were no grounds for determining the existence of reasonable \ngrounds for the application of the principles and the onus that applies in ordinary \nmotion proceedings.34 In NDPP v Rautenbach35 the court held that in determining \nwhether there were reasonable grounds for believing that a confiscation order might \nbe made, the court needed to ask only if there was evidence that might reasonably \nsupport a conviction and a consequent confiscation order, even if all the evidence \nhad not been brought before it, and whether that evidence might reasonably be \nbelieved.36 This means that the latter will not be the case where the evidence sought \nto be relied upon proves unreliable. The above two judgements reveal that the \nreasonable grounds for believing standard is rather weak when compared with the \nstandard that an applicant in ordinary motion court proceedings is expected to meet.  \nPersons affected by a restraint order are deprived of property rights pertaining to \nproperty to which the restraint order applies.37 They are prohibited from dealing in \nany manner with the property.38 Furthermore the restraint order usually entails an \norder directing the defendant and other affected persons to surrender their property \nto a curator bonis appointed under section 28 of POCA. It is submitted that there are \nconstitutional safeguards against the arbitrary deprivation of property rights,39 and \ntherefore the discretion granted to the court in granting restraint orders is \nquestionable. There are no tangible safeguards in POCA to ensure that the court \ndoes not exercise a purely subjective discretion.

There \nshould be no arbitrary deprivation of property rights. \n2.2 The confiscation and the realisation stage41 \nThe criminal forfeiture scheme set out in Chapter 5 of POCA is closely modelled on \nthat found in the United States and in the United Kingdom\'s Criminal Justice Act,42 \nand South African courts draw assistance and have cited with approval from \njudgements of American and English courts in a number of cases.43  \nIn South Africa the "confiscation stage" entails an enquiry by the court convicting a \ndefendant into any benefit that he derived from any of the offences in respect of \nwhich he has been convicted or from any related criminal activity. If successful, this \nstage of proceedings manifests in a confiscation order, which takes the form of a \nmoney judgement against the defendant, and in terms of which he is required to \npay a specific sum of money to the state.44 Unless the court is able to determine the \nissue of confiscation on the basis of evidence and the proceedings of the trial,45 or \non the basis of further oral evidence,46 it will direct the prosecutor and the defendant \nto deliver statements contemplated in section 21 of POCA. \nThe confiscation stage of proceedings begins only after a defendant has been \nconvicted. Here the term "confiscation" is used in a broad sense. During the \nconfiscation stage the public prosecutor in the criminal case may apply to the court \nto conduct what is generally referred to as a confiscation inquiry. The primary \n                                        \n40  S 25 of the Constitution. \n41  In this article the terms "assets" and "property" are used interchangeably. See further Keightley \nAsset Forfeiture 36-39.  \n42  United Kingdom Criminal Justice Act, 1998. \n43  See for example Shaik v State 2007 2 All SA 150 (SCA) 155, where the court relied on the \ndecision in R v Simpson 1998 2 CR App R (S) 111 on the issue of the possibility of multiple \nrestraint orders; and Shaik v State 2007 2 All SA 150 (SCA) 158, where the court relied on R v \nSmith 2002 1 All ER 367 (HC) in finding that "benefit" means gross, as opposed to net benefit. \n44  Ss 18-24 of POCA. \n45  S 18(6)(a)(i) of POCA. \n46  S 18(6)(a)(ii) of POCA. \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1055 \npurpose of the confiscation inquiry is to determine whether the defendant has \nbenefited from any of the offences in respect of which he or she was convicted or \nfrom any criminal activity which the court finds to be sufficiently related to those \noffences.47 This is determined according to the civil standard of a balance of \nprobabilities.48  \nWhere the court conducting the confiscation enquiry finds that the defendant \nbenefited, the court may make an order against the defendant for the payment to \nthe state of any amount that it considers appropriate.49 This generates the second \nphase of the confiscation inquiry, which is directed at determining if and for what \namount a confiscation order should be made. Section 18(2) of POCA indicates the \namount the court may order the defendant to pay the state.  \nIn addition to specifying what the upper limit of a confiscation order may be, it lies \nwith the discretion of the court to determine any appropriate amount below the \nupper limit. The discretion of the court at a confiscation inquiry is wide,50 and largely \ndepends on the facts of each case. The court must exercise its discretion rationally.51 \nThe court must ensure and also be satisfied that the confiscation order it makes is \nrationally connected to the purpose sought to be achieved by the confiscation \norder.52  \nThe underlying purpose of a confiscation order is to ensure that criminals do not \nenjoy the fruits of their criminal conduct.53 The confiscation order is intended to be a \ndeterrent against criminality and to deprive convicted persons of ill-gotten gains.54 It \nis further directed at removing from criminals the financial means of committing \nfurther crimes.55 The confiscation order is in addition to any punishment the court \n                                        \n47   S 18(1) of POCA.

The choice of \nlanguage for the purposes of criminal forfeiture is questionable, as it borrows directly \nfrom the provisions of Chapter 6 regarding civil forfeitures. In NDPP v Mtungwa,62 \nHunt J maintained that the definition of "proceeds of unlawful activities" was widely \nworded.63 He rejected the NDPP\'s submission that sections 18 and 22 of POCA \nbecome operational when the "unlawful activities" are a causa sine qua non of the \nbenefits, maintaining rather that the court is constitutionally bound to apply the \nmore stringent test, which is the causa causans test.64  \nSection 20 of POCA provides for the amounts which may be realised at the time of \nmaking a confiscation order against a defendant. Section 20(1) of POCA allows the \ncourt the discretion to allow or disallow claims. The obligations subtracted in terms \nof section 20(1) are those which have "priority and which the court may recognise \n                                        \n56  S 18(1) POCA. \n57  NDPP v Rautenbach 2005 SACR 530 (SCA) 552. \n58  NDPP v Rautenbach 2005 SACR 530 (SCA) 552. \n59   NDPP v Rautenbach 2005 SACR 530 (SCA) 552. \n60  Shaik v State 2007 2 All SA 150 (SCA) 159-160. \n61 Section 1 of POCA: the definition of "proceeds of unlawful activities" for the purposes of a \nconfiscation inquiry includes benefits received both directly and indirectly. In Shaik v State 2007 \n2 All SA 150 (SCA) para 64, it was held that the proceeds of the defendant\'s unlawful activities \nincluded benefits derived by a shareholder of a company that was enriched through the \nshareholders\' criminal activities.  \n62  NDPP v Mtungwa 2006 1 SACR 122 (N). \n63  NDPP v Mtungwa 2006 1 SACR 122 (N) 129. \n64  NDPP v Mtungwa 2006 1 SACR 122 (N) 129. \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1057 \nfor this purpose". An assessment of the facts surrounding alleged priority in relation \nto an asset in the defendant\'s estate will guide the court in deciding whether or not \nto have that asset forfeited. Section 30(5) of POCA provides for possible steps that \nmay be taken by the creditors of the defendant. Any of the defendant\'s expenses in \nconnection with an asset and with regard to which the court finds some form of \n"priority" may be deducted by the court when it makes a confiscation order. Section \n18(2) of POCA clearly provides that a confiscation order is not limited to a net \namount. A confiscation order can be made in respect of any property which falls \nwithin the ambit of the broader definition of "property".65 \nIn South Africa as soon as it is established that a material benefit was derived, the \nfact that some of the assets to be confiscated or restrained were acquired by the \ndefendant before the offence was committed is irrelevant.66 In South Africa the \n"realisation stage" of criminal asset forfeiture is initiated when a defendant fails to \nsatisfy a confiscation order. The "realisation stage" in essence is a specialised form \nof execution against affected property.67 An application for the realisation of property \ntakes place after a confiscation order has been granted. The objective of such an \napplication is to obtain a court order directing any person who holds realisable \nproperty to hand such property to the curator bonis.68 The court order empowers the \ncurator bonis to obtain property which is not included in the confiscation order. \nWhere a curator bonis has not been appointed when an application for a realisation \norder serves before the court, the court hearing the application makes that \nappointment.69 A realisation of property order broadens the application of the \nconfiscation order. \nPart 4 of POCA70 deals with the selling of restrained assets by the curator in \nsatisfaction of a confiscation order. The state can apply to the High Court for a \nrealisation order only if: (i) a confiscation order has been granted and has not been \nsettled by the defendant; (ii) a confiscation order is not subject to an appeal or \n                                        \n65  Shaik v State 2007 2 All SA 150 (SCA) para 60. \n66  NDPP v Rautenbach 2005 SACR 530 (SCA) 552. \n67  Ss 30-36 of POCA. \n68  S 30 of POCA. \n69  S 30(2)(a) of POCA. \n70 Ss 30-36 of POCA. \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1058 \nreview; and (iii) a defendant has not been acquitted or the criminal charges against \nhim have not been withdrawn.71 All persons known to have interests in the \nrestrained assets should be given notice of the application for realisation.72 This \nincludes both creditors and victims. It is submitted that such a notice should be \ngiven by the state. POCA is not clear on what form this notice should take and who \nshould monitor compliance. \n2.3 Constitutional concerns about the practice of criminal asset \nforfeiture in South Africa \nThe role of the Bill of Rights, which was introduced in South Africa shortly before the \nestablishment of the National Prosecuting Authority and the adoption of POCA, is of \ninsurmountable importance and significance in the development of the law regarding \nasset forfeiture in South Africa. The Bill of Rights contains and demands far reaching \nprotections for individual rights, including the right to equality,73 the right to human \ndignity,74 the right to freedom and security of the person,75 and the protection of \nproperty rights.76 The South African Constitution places a positive duty on the state \nto respect, protect, promote and fulfil these rights.77 This duty imposes an obligation \non the state to implement appropriate law enforcement measures in the interests of \nprotecting the rights of society.  \nIt is submitted that in South Africa, a state which is afflicted by high levels of crime, \nthis duty can prove to be daunting. Where asset forfeiture is implemented as a law \nenforcement measure, the fulfilment by the state of its public obligation inevitably \ngives rise to a conflict between its public duty and its duty to respect the individual \nrights of persons whose property is affected by asset forfeiture proceedings. The \n                                        \n71 S 30(1) of POCA. \n72 S 30(3) of POCA. \n73 S 9 of the Constitution: the right to equality includes the right to equal protection and benefit of \nthe law. \n74  S 10 of the Constitution. \n75  S 12 of the Constitution: this includes the right not to be punished in a cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading way. \n76  S 25 of the Constitution. \n77  S 7(2) of the Constitution. \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1059 \ncourts are guided by constitutional imperatives in determining when asset forfeiture \nis justifiable. \nTwo recent Constitutional Court cases explored the tension between the robust asset \nforfeiture measures provided for by POCA and the need to avoid arbitrary \ndeprivations of property. The first case, Prophet v National Director Public \nProsecutions,78 involved the use of a residential house as a mini laboratory for the \nmanufacture of the drug known as "tik". The second case, Mohunram v National \nDirector of Public Prosecutions,79 involved the use of a business premises for the \nrunning of an unlicensed casino. Both cases concerned applications to forfeit \nimmovable property as instrumentalities of an offence. In both cases the \nConstitutional Court confirmed the importance of proportionality in the assessment \nof the constitutional validity of asset forfeiture in terms of POCA, in other words \nweighing the severity of the interference with individual rights to property against \nthe extent to which the property was used for the purposes of the commission of the \noffence, taking cognisance of the nature of the offence.80 Proportionality is not a \nstatutory requirement but an equitable requirement that has been formulated by the \ncourts to curb the excesses of forfeiture. This implies that the requirement of \nproportionality is a constitutional imperative.81 In the light Mohunram v NDPP82 and \nProphet v NDPP83 it is submitted that in South Africa there are generally two policy \nrationales for asset forfeiture. First, the gains from unlawful activity should not \naccrue and accumulate to those who commit unlawful activity. Those individuals \nshould not be accorded the rights and privileges normally attendant to property law. \nIn the case of fraud and theft, the proceeds should be retrieved and redistributed to \nthe victims. Second, the state as a matter of policy is endeavouring to suppress the \nconditions that lead to unlawful activities. In South Africa the courts have accepted a \npolicy rationale based on the fact that it is often impossible to bring the leaders of \norganised crime to book in view of the fact that they invariably ensure that they are \n                                        \n78  Prophet v NDPP 2005 2 SACR 670 (SCA). See further Kruger Organised Crime 15-25. \n79  Mohunram v NDPP 2007 4 SA 222 (CC). \n80  Prophet v NDPP 2005 2 SACR 670 (SCA) 678; Mohunram v NDPP 2007 4 SA 222 (CC) 230. \n81  Mohunram v NDPP 2007 4 SA 222 (CC) 237.  \n82  Mohunram v NDPP 2007 4 SA 222 (CC). \n83  Prophet v NDPP 2005 2 SACR 670 (SCA). \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1060 \nfar removed from the overt criminal activity involved. An effective operation against \norganised crime generally succeeds in bringing only the eminently replaceable foot \nsoldiers to book. Asset forfeiture circumvents and bypasses this problem by allowing \nthe gains of an unlawful enterprise to be brought to justice. \nThe three judgements in Mohunram are in agreement that the objective of \ncombating organised crime is a relevant factor in the proportionality analysis. Where \nthe judgements are in disagreement is with regard to the weight to be given to \nPOCA\'s underlying objective in the proportionality analysis, and in the application of \nthe proportionality principle to the facts of the case. In assessing the impact \nMohunram will have on the future development of the law relating to asset forfeiture \nin South Africa, cognisance ought to be taken of two factors. The first is that much \nwill always depend on the facts of each case as they are presented in court. An \ninterpretation of the judgements in Mohunram reveals that both the majority and \nminority of the court took into account an array of factors.84 The office of the NDPP \nwill certainly be guided by Mohunram in the manner in which it presents future \ncases, and no doubt will select its cases accordingly. The second is that the \narguments by the amicus in Mohunram focussed specifically on the future of \ninstrumentalities under Chapter 6, rather than on proceeds under Chapter 6, or on \ncriminal forfeiture under Chapter 5. There are specific and significant differences \nbetween forfeitures aimed at the proceeds of crime and at the benefits derived from \ncriminal activity on the one hand, and at forfeitures aimed at instrumentalities on the \nother. It is submitted that it is less complicated to justify the forfeiture of property \nwhich a person derived from criminal activity or to require a convicted defendant to \npay to the state an amount equivalent to what he or she benefitted from the \nrelevant criminal activity. Undoubtedly, Chapter 6 civil forfeitures aimed at proceeds, \nand criminal forfeitures under Chapter 5 must survive constitutional scrutiny and \nshould not be arbitrary. \n                                        \n84  Mohunram v NDPP 2007 4 SA 222 (CC) 234-236, where the following factors are listed: "the \nnature and gravity of the offence, the extent to which ordinary criminal law measures are \neffective in dealing with it, the public impact and the potential for widespread social harm and \ndisruption". \n \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1061 \n3 Concluding remarks and recommendations \nIn South Africa criminal asset forfeiture law is an integral part of criminal law \nenforcement. The reasons advanced for including the forfeiture of assets as part of \ncriminal law enforcement are varied. Primarily, law enforcement agents and the \ncourts want not only to arrest the offender and sentence him or her to imprisonment \nfor a period of time, but also to remove the instruments of crime from circulation \neither by the offender himself or herself or by members of his or her organisation.  \nIn the South African criminal justice system criminal asset forfeiture is a measure \nwhich is intended to restore the ex ante legal situation by depriving the offender of \nwhat is not legally his. Systems of criminal law and criminal procedure are based on \ncertain principles. In South Africa certain legal provisions of criminal asset forfeiture \nare inconsistent with important principles of substantive and procedural law. Among \nthem are the presumption of innocence and the principle that someone can be \nconvicted for explicitly indicted and proven criminal offences only. It is debatable \nand questionable whether the serious infringement of these principles can be \njustified. When government creates new laws the focus of these laws should not be \nlimited to individual provisions. From a constitutional perspective the following \nspecific submissions are made together with recommendations for reform in the area \nof criminal asset forfeiture in terms of POCA:  \n(1) From the short title of POCA85 it appears as if POCA deals only with organised \ncrime and an impression is created that a definition of "organised crime" can be \nfound in POCA. In fact POCA does not define organised crime.86 Its purpose as \nreflected in the short and the long titles and in the preamble is to prevent \norganised crime. POCA introduces new offences of racketeering,87 money \nlaundering88 and criminal gang activities,89 which are known organised crimes, \n                                        \n85 POCA does not define the concept "organised crime". See NDPP v Vermaak 2008 1 SACR 157 \n(SCA) para 4, where Nugent JA used the concept to describe offences that have organisational \nfeatures of some kind that distinguish them from individual criminal  wrongdoing. \n86  De Koker "Organised Crime" 45-46. \n87 Ch 2 of POCA. \n88 Ch 3 of POCA. \n89 Ch 4 of POCA. \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1062 \nbut it also has a list of 33 pre-existing common law and statutory offences \nreferred to in schedule 1, which may be committed by individuals. POCA \ntherefore also applies to cases of individual wrongdoing. The Supreme Court of \nAppeal confirmed in NDPP v Geyser90 that POCA also applies to crimes that \ncannot be categorised as organised crimes. Although the issues covered by \nPOCA may appear to be disparate, it can be inferred that POCA intends to \nprevent serious crimes committed by individuals, groups or syndicates. It is \nrecommended that a more appropriate title will be "The Prevention of \nOrganised and Serious Crimes Act", because such a title will cover organised \ncrimes as well as cases of serious wrongdoing by individuals. \n(2) In POCA the in rem fiction gives rise to constitutional concerns and can lead to \nlegal complications for asset forfeiture. The fiction, which is constitutionally \nproblematic, has been criticised internationally, and can lead to unsightly \nparadox in the canon of South African case law. It is recommended that since \nSouth Africa does not have a binding tradition of forfeiture, the South African \nConstitutional Court should down play the in rem fiction and focus instead on \ncriminal doctrinal arguments that illuminate POCA\'s constitutionality. \n(3) Section 25(1) of the Constitution states that "no law may permit arbitrary \ndeprivation of property". There is very little South African jurisprudence \nexpounding the concept of arbitrariness. The High Court addressed \n"arbitrariness" in the area of warrants for search and seizure. In Deutschmann \nv Commissioner for the Revenue Service,91 the state after an ex-parte \nproceeding issued a warrant to seize property believed to represent the \nproceeds of tax fraud. The constitutionality of the issuance of the warrant was \nquestioned.92 The defendants objected on the ground of arbitrariness and the \ncourt maintained that:  \n                                        \n90  NDPP v Geyser 2008 ZASCA 15 [25 March 2008] para 19. \n91  Deutschmann v Commissioner for the Revenue Service 2000 2 SA 106 (E). \n92  Deutschmann v Commissioner for the Revenue Service 2000 2 SA 106 (E). \n', "V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1063 \nThe provisions in terms of which the warrant was sought and obtained in both \nmatters do anything but permit arbitrary deprivation of property - these provisions \nrequire an application supported by information supplied under oath and the \nexercise of a discretion by a Judge. The Judge who authorises the warrant does not \nthereby affect the property or the rights to such property vesting in an individual. \nAny party remains free, in terms of the statute, to establish his entitlement and \nclaim delivery.93  \nThus the three pillars enumerated by the court were an informative application; \ndiscretionary judicial authorisation; and an opportunity to establish entitlement. In \nPOCA deprivation is achieved only after an application and the exercise of judicial \ndiscretion.94 The opportunity to establish entitlement is left with the owner on the \nbasis of an innocent owner defence proceeding. On the basis of the above analysis, \nunder the South African judiciary's conception of arbitrariness, POCA would probably \npass constitutional muster with relative ease. \n(a) Joint liability in cases where several persons committed a criminal offence can \nlead to a situation where the forfeited amount goes beyond the amount of the \nindividual's interest. This is not consistent with the requirement in POCA that \nonly the defendant's interest can be forfeited, and it may lead to a situation \nwhere the defendant has to forfeit more than he actually obtained. It is \ntherefore recommended that where a criminal offence has been committed by \nseveral persons, the proceeds should be divided proportionally between them. \nEach offender should be held liable for his pro rata share of the proceeds. \n(b) Once a restraint order is granted or confirmed prior to conviction, absent \nrequirements for variation or rescission laid down in section 26(5)(a) of POCA, \na restraint order is not capable of being changed, and thus the defendant is \nstripped of the restrained assets and any control or use of them, and therefore \npending the conclusion of the trial or the confiscation proceedings he is \nremediless. It is recommended that the defendant should be afforded a remedy \nto reclaim restrained assets during the restraint stage of POCA proceedings, \nbecause not affording him such a remedy is tantamount to arbitrary deprivation \nof property, a situation which section 25 of the Constitution prohibits.  \n                                        \n93  Deutschmann v Commissioner for the Revenue Service 2000 2 SA 106 (E). \n94  S 38(1) of POCA. \n", 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1064 \n(c) POCA does not make provision for the recovery of interest that has \naccumulated on a "benefit" from the date of the offence to the date of the \nconfiscation order and this allows the defendant to enjoy that part of the \nbenefit from the crime. It is recommended that the following provision be \ninserted in POCA in order to prevent such practice: \n(d)  Any interest derived from a benefit of the proceeds of crime, from the date of \nthe offence to the date of issuance of a confiscation order, is deemed to be \npart of the proceeds of crime.  \n(e) In terms of section 30 of POCA it is settled law that criminal asset forfeiture \nmakes provision for the consideration of loss suffered by victims of crime. It is \nrecommended, however, that section 30 of POCA should distinguish between \nvictims who participated willingly in the commission of a crime and those who \ndid not. This is of critical importance when it comes to the issue of the \nreimbursement of the victim and is also essential for the wider objective of \nPOCA, which is to ensure that crime does not pay.  \n(f) The presumption of innocence poses the most serious constitutional challenge, \nas regards forfeiture in terms of POCA. In S v Zuma95 the Constitutional Court \nexplicitly set out the parameters of the presumption of innocence protection: \n... the presumption of innocence is derived from the centuries old principle of \nEnglish law. It is always for the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused \nperson, and the proof must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \nIn S v Zuma the court adopted a two pronged approach:  \n(i) The presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be \nconvicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. \n(ii) If by the provisions of a statutory presumption an accused is required to \nestablish, that is to say to prove or disprove, on a balance of probabilities \neither an element of an offence or an excuse, then it contravenes section 11(d) \n(Interim Constitution, precursor to section 35(3) of the South African \n                                        \n95  S v Zuma 1995 2 SA 642 (CC) 656. \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1065 \nConstitution). Such a provision would permit a conviction in spite of reasonable \ndoubt.96  \nIn terms of POCA the state need only prove its case on a balance of probabilities. \nThis appears to violate approach (i) above because a reasonable doubt can exist \nregardless of the balance of probabilities standard having being met. The innocent \nowner defence is not an adequate prophylactic because the innocent owner defence \nviolates approach (ii) above. It requires the defendant to establish an excuse on a \nbalance of probabilities. This is too low a standard. It may permit conviction despite \na reasonable doubt. Although the presumption of innocence as formulated in Zuma \ndoes not disqualify the burden shift entailed in POCA per se, it does however \ndiscredit the balance of probabilities standard advanced by POCA.  \n(a) Section 35(3)(m) of the Constitution provides what amounts to a double \njeopardy provision. With regard to civil asset forfeiture the literal interpretation of \nthis provision is that a second trial may not follow, since the first trial if only \nnominally civil would be preclusive. The state would have to combine the POCA \nproceedings with the underlying criminal proceedings and engage in a single unified \nlitigation. If POCA was punitive, a body of constitutional rights for the accused would \nfollow, effectively eviscerating POCA. Accommodating a meaningful right to counsel \nand requiring a prosecution in conjunction with the civil case would entail increased \nadministrative and related costs, while presuming innocence would deprive the state \nof its most powerful law enforcement mechanism under POCA as it stands. In order \nto prevent precipitating the body of constitutional rights, the state would explicitly \nrefute arguments that the owner in POCA civil proceedings is an accused facing \ncriminal prosecution. \n  \n                                        \n96  S v Zuma 1995 2 SA 642 (CC) 656. \n', 'V BASDEO  PER / PELJ 2014(17)3 \n1066 \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nLiterature \nCasella 2003 Acta Juridica \nCasella SD "The development of asset forfeiture law in the United States" \n2003 Acta Juridica 314-360 \nDe Koker "Organised Crime" \nDe Koker L "Organised Crime, Racketeering, Money Laundering and Criminal \nGang Activities - Reflections on Terminology" Unpublished paper SAPS Crime \nInformation Analysis Centre (1999) \nDe Koker 2002 Journal of Money Laundering Control \nDe Koker L "Money laundering trends in South Africa" 2002 Journal of Money \nLaundering Control 27-41 \nGupta 2002 Harv CR-CL Law Rev \nGupta D "Republic of South Africa\'s Prevention of Organised Crime Act: a \ncomparative Bill of Rights analysis" 2002 Harv CR-CL Law Rev 159-182 \nKeightley Asset Forfeiture \n  Keightley R Asset Forfeiture in South Africa under the Prevention of Organised \nCrime Act 121 of 1998 (William Pratt House Landsdowne 2009) \nKruger Organised Crime \n  Kruger A Organised Crime and Proceeds of Crime Law in South Africa \n(LexisNexis Durban 2008) \nRedpath 2000 African Security Review \n   Redpath J "Forfeiting rights?
