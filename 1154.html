In the socio-cultural system of customary communities there are components such as customary \nstratification, permissiveness, communication, reciprocity, past history, cultural values, customary norms \nand sanctions, religious and customary leadership. Components in the socio-cultural system of indigenous \nand tribal peoples play a role in the EIA process in the Tabi Mamta customary area especially in the \nenvironmental feasibility decision making process. The components of custom stratification, cultural values \nand customary norms play a role in the EIA process. In customary stratification there is uncustomary \nstructure in the ondoafi, Iram and Tribal Leadership. Components in a sociual cultural system is a unity \nresulting from interaction between individuals and groups to prevent environmental damage and disturbance \nof natural resources. Natural resources are considered as ancestral symbols passed down by ancestors from \ngeneration to generation \n1 Introduction \nPapua is located in the eastern part of Indonesia. It has \ntwo provincial administrative areas, namely West Papua \nProvince and Papua Province, where there are 7 (seven) \ncustomary areas, namely Tabi Mamta, La-Pago, HaAnim,\nMi- Pago, Saireri, Bomberai, and Domberai. In \nthe Amdal process, indigenous and tribal peoples feel \nthat there is injustice, inequality, disagreement based on \nthe existence of customary values and norms within the \ncustomary law community's living order. The purpose of \nthis study is to find a picture of the involvement of \nIndigenous Peoples of Tabi Mamta in the process of \nanalyzing environmental impacts in the Tabi Mamta \ncustomary territory.  \nThe type of research used is non-ethnographic \nqualitative research with data collection techniques using \nlimited observation techniques. Data and information in \nthe field will be analyzed using constructivism paradigm. \nThe paradigm of constructivism is based on an \ninterpretive understanding called hermeneutics \n(hermeneuien) in the sense of interpreting, giving \nunderstanding, translating data and information obtained \nin the research location as a result of social reality. The \nresults describe the components in the social cultural \nsystem of customary and tribal peoples in the \nEnvironmental Impact Analysis process in Tabi Mamta \nCustomary Area. Furthermore, in this research, the \nexistence of Tabi Mamta customary Community is a \ncommunity which still has territorial of customary \nterritory, has a clear and respected leadership structure \n(Ondoafi, Iram, and Chief of Tribe), the relationship of \nkinship, cultural values and customary norms and \nsanctions, and have environmental wisdom in \nmaintaining the existence of Natural Resources.  \nThe values and norms in the life of indigenous \npeoples, as well as the existence of natural resources as \nproperty rights of Indigenous People of ancestral lands \nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\nÂ© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Data and information in \nthe field were obtained through in-depth interviews \nusing unstructured structured question materials (using \nrecording instruments) on key figures (key informants). \nDetermination of key figures as a source of data and \ninformation obtained through snowball technique \n(snowball sampling).  \nFurther data and information obtained will be \nanalyzed using constructivism paradigm. The paradigm \nof constructivism is based on an interpretive \nunderstanding called hermeneutics (hermeneuien) in the \nsense of interpreting, giving understanding, translating \ndata and information obtained in the research location as \na result of social reality                  \n3 Research Result \nTabi Mamta customary territory is located in the \nnorthern part of Jayapura (in the east by Papua New \nGuinea) up to Mamberamo (western) and South \nbordering Jayawijaya Mountains. Administratively, the \nterritory of Tabi Mamta Indigenous Peoples covers \nKeerom Regency, Jayapura City, Jayapura Regency, \nSarmi Regency and Mamberamo Raya Regency. \n The Tabi Mamta  People is called TABI MAMTA \nbecause it comes from the Sunrise (TABI) which then \nresides in the Mamberamo River Basin and the Tami \nRiver Basin (MAMTA). The history of the journey of \nthe Tabi Mamta  People begins with the existence of a \nSun and Moon god who bears the Sun and Moon. The \nGod of the Sun and the Moon began the journey from \nwhere the sun began. Furthermore, the first stopover of \nthe Sun and Moon gods from the east is called Tabatji \nvillage (first village). After a night of exhaustion, then \nthe journey continues back towards the West. Arriving in \none place, the Sun and Moon gods no longer continue \ntheir journey. Pikulan in the form of a Sun and the Moon \nthen placed somewhere that causes the occurrence of a \nlarge hole. \nThe place is now called Bhuyakha (Water Place) or \ncalled Lake Sentani. It is from this place that later \ngenerations to the genaration develop and inhabit the \nMamberamo River Basin and the Tami River Basin. For \nthat reason, the Tabi Mamta Indigenous Peoplehighly \nappreciates their leaders because the people still consider \nthat their leader is the incarnation of the sun god and the \nmoon. Their leader is called Ondofolo or ondoafi, and \nfor certain customary territories is called Iram. The view \nof Indigenous Peoplewhich still holds the leadership of \nOndofolo said that Tabi Mamta People comes from Tabi \nmeaning sunrise, up to Mamberamo River Basin Region \nand Tami River Basin. While the view of the Indigenous \nPeopleof Iram argues that the origin of the Tabi Mamta \nCustomary Law spread from the upper Mamberamo \nRiver across the mountains in the Mamberamo region to \nthe Sarmi region and spread to Fak Fak area (found the \nsame clan name that is the "Wou" clan) which is \nadministratively Is in West Papua Province. According \nto the story of the ancestors this incident stems from the \nseparation of brother and sister due to tribal wars that \nresulted in scattering toward the West \n4 Indigenous Peoples Leadership \nSystem Keondoafian \nThe system of keondoafian is a system of leadership of \nthe Tabi Mamta Customary Law Community, led by a \nhereditary patent (patrinial) who has birthright, is \nappointed and respected in indigenous peoples. \nIndigenous PeopleTabi Mamta ondofolo leadership \nconsiders that ondofolo is the incarnation of the sun and \nthe moon god. The territory of the system of keondoafian \nis in the Sentani valley, the Grime valley to the north \ncoast. Leaders in the Sentani valley and Grime valley are \ncalled ondofolo, while on the coast is called ondoafi. The \nword Ondoafi or Ondofolo comes from the language of \nTepera namely Ondewafi which means Head of \nCustomary Country or "Take care of the People", \n"Master who care, give life for the people". \nThe language of Tobaji calls Harsori, the \nNimboran language of Iram or Dekening, the language \nof Kemtuk and Gresi mentioning Duguea and Dugeno, \nJouwawary Language mentioning Matawun Pan or \nMarar Matawun, Nachaiba Language (Big and Small \nOrmu) called Tubwe and Moi Language mentioning \nDone word which means taking care of goods Pet. In the \ncustomary region Tabi Mamta is familiar with custom \nsymbols. Customary symbols are highly respected, \nrespected and have a high religious value. These custom \nsymbols are communal lands, forest resources, and other \nnatural resources. The symbols of customary have been \ntraditionally adhered from the ancestors of the Tabi \nMamta Customary Law Community. Indigenous \nsymbols have always been under traditional rule. The \nhighest customary authority governing custom symbols \nis in the hands of Ondofolo or Ondoafi. The customary \nstructure of the cynosure system begins with a leader \ncalled ondofolo. Ondofolo in his leadership was assisted \nby the clans awarded Abhu Affa who was assigned as a \nsubstitute ondofolo when ondofolo was absent at an \nevent, as well as the title of Abhu Akho who served as \nan intermediary or spokesman ondofolo, and Koselo \n(Ondofolo Yo) Stairs inside Yo (kampung). The \nstructure under Koselo (ondofolo Yo) is a clan or \nAkhona, which is authorized to keep the customary \ntreasures, and then the lowest structure is the people or \nthe customary community called Akha Beakhe. The \nfollowing figure shows the traditional structure of \nkeondofoloan system. \n \n2\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n', ' \n5 Indigenous Peoples Leadership \nSystem Iram \nThe Tabi Mamta Indigenous People which has the \nleadership pattern of the Iram system is in the Grime \nvalley customary territory. According to the beliefs and \nbeliefs of Indigenous Nambloung people that 3 (three) \ntraditional leaders are symbols of the Sun. The \ncustomary leader or Iram is assisted by Takai who serves \nas uncustomary adviser or judge, as well as \nDuneskingwou who is a customary spokesman or daily \nexecutive. Iram\'s duties within the customary village are \nto protect the people from all threats and to promote the \nwelfare of the people. Meanwhile, when out of the \nvillage customary Iram\'s duty is to establish relationships \nwith Iram who was in another village. In traditional talks \nthe spokesperson or daily executive (Duneskingwou) can \nnot express his opinions before the advisor (Takai) \nexpresses his opinion in the form of advice to Iram. So \nthe decision issued by Iram as the supreme leader is \nconsidered to be the highest decision and is of a scral \nnature, and can not be violated. If the decision is violated \nthen there will be custom sanctions that are believed to \nbring disaster to those who violate it. \nIn carrying out his duties then Iram assisted \nDuneskingwou as spokesperson or daily executive and \nNeskingwouw as head of general government. The \nPublic Administration Board is divided into 4 (four) \nsections namely Yrung Neskingwoow as head of general \ngovernment as well as Indigenous Council, Iram Tang as \nhead of general government in charge of external affairs \nand in indigenous kampong, Takay Tang Neskingwoow \nas head of the affairs of the judiciary and community \nprotector , And Takay Tang Sa Neskingwoow as head of \ngeneral affairs in the field of customary justice. The \nmeaning of Tang is clan (Clan) or clan that has line line \nof descentIram, Takay or Duneskingwoow.In addition \nthere is also Undo Hamong You Hlu / Hamung bu lelou \nwho served as a financial supervisor or Examination \nAgency treasures treasures and customary finance. \nWhile Undo Hamong Bu Hlu as financial executor or \nHead of Kampung Finance Agency duty to receive, \nstore, maintain and issue treasures customary treasures \nor money (dwei). In the leadership structure of Iram \nthere are legal advisors called Hlu Waji or Ki Waji, as \nwell as Wue Leng\'s duties as a messenger, and Flomewu \nHlu as Commander of War. \n \n6 Indigenous Peoples of Collective \nLeadership System \nThis pattern is located in the northern coastal area of \nJayapura Regency, especially in Ambora, Tablanusu, \nYepase, Dormena, Ormu, Tarvi and some areas of \nKeerom up to the border area of Papua New Guinea \nState (PNG). In addition, collective leadership patterns \nwere also found in the villages of Meikari, Skori, \nDemetim, Sabeyab Kecil, Mamda and Aimbe. The \nCustomary Law Society This Collective Leadership was \nformed due to the acculturation of culture, due to mixed \nmarriage among tribes, and the inclusion of other tribes \noutside the majority tribe forming customary village. For \nexample the occurrence of cultural mixing that can be \nseen from the names of the clan. For example the \noccurrence of cultural mixing that can be seen from the \nnames of the clan. Like the clan name "Pangkatana" in \ncustom area of doyo, which is a mixing culture Sentani \nand Genyem. Then clan "Marweri" which is a mix \nbetween Sentani culture, especially in Sentani lake area \nwith Genyem. Similarly the "Wasangge" clan in the \nKanda Boroway region is a mixture of Kemtuk culture \nwith Genyem.  \nThere is also a cultural mix between cultures of \nindigenous and tribal peoples who live in villages west \nof Lake Sentani with customary law communities \nresiding in the Ormu region to the west of the Dormena \nregion, Waib to the Kaptiaw region.Another example in \nthe Tarvi region is the Subu tribe of Ronggowai tribe in \nSarmi. So if there are customary events ondoafi will \ncome to the Sarmi region to follow the traditional \nceremony, which should follow the traditional ceremony \nin the region Tarond keondoafian. Tarvi region actually \nentered the administrative area of Sarmi Regency, while \nmuaib entered the administrative area of Jayapura \nRegency. \nThe process of territorial capability begins with a \nsystem of exchange of natural resources (burter). \nBeginning with indigenous peoples of Genyem \n(Jayapura District), they have their fields swapped for \nthe marine products brought by the Tarvi indigenous \npeople. Then because it has been for a long time then the \nGenyem people build settlements in the coastal area of \nthe Tarvi. The place is now called the village of Muaib. \nThus Tarvi and Muaib have different languages \nthan other villages in the territory of Tarvi\'s \nterondoafian. The pattern of collective leadership is \nusually directed to the odowapi or the head of the Tribe. \nOndowapi or Chief Tribe has the full right (Veto) to \ndecide ancustomary decision. Leadership ondowapi or \nchief of the tribe is selected based on the offspring of the \neldest son in the largest tribe that forms the customary \nvillage. For example the Tabi Mamta Customary Law of \nthe tribe in the village of Kriku and Skrofo. The \ncustomary structure of this village begins with the \nhighest stratum is the Head of the Tribe and then \noversees the clan leaders (keret). The tribal chief holds \nthe highest authority, followed by the clan chiefs. \n7 Social and Cultural Aspects of Tabi \nMamta Indigenous Peoples In Amdal \nProcess \nDevelopment in Papua Province when not yet involve all \nindigenous and tribal peoples. Indigenous and tribal \npeoples involved in development are intended to provide \nconsideration in accordance with local wisdom \napplicable in the area. But in reality the current society is \nnot involved and only as a spectator especially in Papua. \nIn addition, development in Papua is currently aimed \nonly at infrastructure development but not human \ndevelopment. So there is no change in the mental attitude \n3\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n', " \nof the Papuans. This is evident with the consumptive \nlifestyle of Papuans. Especially with the policy of \nproviding assistance to the villages, do not give an \nimpact on the mental development of Papuans. \nThere was the sale of customary lands, while the \nvalue of land for the Tabi Mamta Indigenous People was \nsacred. Customary land rights and powers are an integral \npart of customary structure, so that when customary \nlands are sold, there is a fundamental change to the \nauthority and power of the Tabi Mamta Customary Law \nCommunity. \n8 The Indigenous Peoples Stratification \nThe customary structure of indigenous people's life in \nTabi Mamta is seen in the customary stratification that \nstill exists today. The stratification has been customary \nand structured by the ancestors of indigenous peoples. \nThe form of social stratification in Tabi Mamta \nindigenous people is known by the customary \nstratification of Ondofolo as well as in the section of \nTabi Mamta custom territory called Iram system. The \nindigenous structures formed in customary stratification  \nhave been established since ancestors. \nOndoafi or Iram is the highest level in traditional \nstructures in Tabi Mamta customary territory. For \nexample in the Sentani customary area there are 33 \nOndoafi that protect tribes and clans, while in other parts \nthere are several Iram and collective leadership systems \n(tribal chief). Relation to development especially in the \nfield of Amdal, the stratification of customary is \ncurrently not running in accordance with its function. \nThis is because indigenous peoples are not involved and \ngiven the authority according to customary stratification \nin the development process in Amdal field. There should \nbe a strengthening of indigenous peoples at the village \nlevel by the government, by providing assistance to \ncustomary components in traditional stratification, as \nwell as providing opportunities for customary leaders \nsuch as Ondoafi, Iram or Chief to play a role according \nto their functions, including in the Amdal decisionmaking\nprocess. \nThe mechanism of development planning including \nenvironmental planning is through the EIA process has \nbeen running until now, but the implementation is not \nmaximized considering the government's intervention is \nstill high, by not giving full authority to the Indigenous \nPeople to regulate themselves in the development \nplanner in the field of environment. Indigenous and \ntribal peoples have been able to plan the development of \nthe environment from generation to generation. \nCustomary planning mechanisms have been established \nbefore the government exists. \nFor example in environmental planning, especially \nin Amdal field, the stages in the customary structure are \ncarried out by firstly giving Ondoafi information to the \nentire community that there will be an activity plan of a \ncompany, then the second mechanism of Ondoafi invites \nthe traditional chiefs and ulayat rights owners to the \nmeeting customary discusses the intended activity plan. \nThe place of the customary meeting took place in \nObhe. All responses and aspirations of customary chiefs \nand owners of customary rights will be discussed in \nObhe, such as the aspiration to refuse activities because \nthere are sacred places that the ancestors should not be \ntouched by strangers or animals. This process is a \nprocess of collecting bottom-up indigenous peoples' \naspirations carried out by Tabi Mamta indigenous \npeoples. This mechanism does not work. This is due to \nthe role of the customary Mechanism has been replaced \nby the role of Musrembang which is more normative and \nguided by village officials. \nIn addition, the mechanism of crafting the \ndevelopment aspirations from the lower levels is not \nworking because the Musrembang apparatus, which is a \nmedium to mediate this process, does not understand \ncustomary knowledge, traditional rules and local culture. \nTherefore the government should strengthen the \nindigenous peoples by providing a portion of authority to \nondoafi and supporting customs with funds and facilities. \nOndoafi and Iram and tribal chiefs hold the highest \nauthority in safeguarding and exploiting customary \nsymbols in the form of customary lands, forests, waters \nand others contained within the customary territory. \nUtilization of custom symbols begins with talks with \nondoafi, because ondoafi is the representative of the \npeople as well as leaders and leaders. \nFor example, in Nimbugresi District of Jayapura \nthere is a Levite tribe in which there is a Wou clan who \nwas appointed osebagai ondoafi by the clans of Sanuel, \nKlemen, Traper, Mebri, Mes, Nian, Tegai, Srom, Rumei \nand Tabisu. The decision-making process in the \ncustomary stratification begins with the customary. All \nclans gathered to agree on the problems faced by the \ncustomary party. Furthermore, from the agreement and \nthe consent of the community is endorsed by ondoafi as \na decision. As in Kampung Yetti and Kriko there are \nManam tribes. Manam tribe appointed Ondoafi Manam \nwhich is customary structure is recognized as the elder \nof the five villages namely Yetti Village, Wembi \nVillage, Kampung Atibai, Kampung Ujung Karang and \nKampung Skuare. \nIn these five villages there are several clans of the \nclan Tungkir, Marga Less, Marga Bewangkir and Marga \nSakor. In the customary territory of Tabi Mamta Manam \nTribe there is Manama Customary Council (DAM). The \nduties and functions of the Manama Tribal Council \n(DAM) are to deal with issues of violations that occur \nwithin the community. \nBeginning with customary land use issues for \ndevelopment purposes up to issues of promises of \nunapplied companies to indigenous peoples Tabi Mamta \nSuku Manam. Tabi Mamta Customary Law Community, \nespecially Manam tribe in the village of Kriko wants if \nthere is a problem between the company and society \ncustomary law then the settlement is done together. \nStarting from the process of meeting up to the \ndecision-making process. Customary parties want a joint \nmeeting to avoid arising suspicion or distrust of \nindigenous peoples against the company. In addition, the \ncustomary community does not feel disadvantaged by \nthe decisions issued by the company. Indigenous people \n4\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n", " \nwant openness among various parties. Coordination \namong the troubled parties continues to be undertaken by \ncustomary parties, companies and governments. \nContinuous coordination will provide customary \nbenefits, such as solving non-discontinuous problems. \nIndigenous peoples do not want any unilateral or \nunilateral settlement \nIn addition, in solving the problem must be \nattended by parties who really have the right to take \ndecisions and can not be represented. Indigenous peoples \nhave a habit in customary meetings that all thoughts put \nforth in the meeting will be a fixed and immediate \ndecision to be implemented. Indigenous and tribal \npeoples do not want a mechanism of stewardship of \nissues that do not take sides with honesty and balance. \nIndigenous Peoples Tabi Mamta Manam tribe in solving \nproblems using the principle of honesty and balance in \nindigenous peoples. \nThe  party is responsible for all the decisions made, \nbecause the decision also represents the spirit of their \nancestors. For that the Indigenous People of Tabi Mamta \nManam Tribe does not want the customs problems \nresolved by companies and government. Governments \nand corporations can only provide material impulses to \nindigenous and tribal peoples, but do not interfere to the \naffairs of decision making. By carrying out such a \nfunction, then indigenous peoples themselves feel that \nthey have been recognized by the government and the \ncompany. \nThe existence to manage their own natural \nresources and create their own welfare. The Indigenous \nPeopleof Tabi Mamta Tribe Manam believes that \nprograms produced by the government and companies \nwill be accepted if the programs benefit the indigenous \npeople. Despite the views of indigenous peoples, it is \nbeneficial but if it can not be realized the Indigenous \nPeopleof Tabi Mamta of Manam tribe will not accept the \nprogram and potentially create conflict among \nindigenous people of Tabi Mamta tribe of Manam tribe \nwith company or government, Tabi Mamta customary \nlaw Manam in decision-making is not based solely by \nindividuals, but decisions collectively among indigenous \nand tribal peoples themselves. \nThe collective decision will then be voiced by \nOndoafi or Chief Tribe. Chiefs are very active role in the \nlife of indigenous people of Manam tribe. Before voicing \nthe results of indigenous peoples' decisions, the \nchieftains coordinate with ondoafi and clan heads. \nCommunication between heads of tribes, ondoafi and \nclan heads (keret) is done continuously. This \ncommunication is not interrupted, if interrupted it will \nlead to conflicts within indigenous peoples. \nIn addition, conflicts can also occur if the company or \ngovernment to communicate continuously to certain \npeople by excluding indigenous peoples Tabi Mamta \nTribe Manam collectively. Government or companies \nneed to know the custom structures that exist in the life \nof indigenous peoples Tabi Mamta Manam tribe. \nFor example in the tribe of Manam there are clans \n(rail). For example, in Suskun village there are Marga \nBogofier, Konondoi clan, Giryar clan, Mesas clan, \nnumber clan, Abar clan, Krunggir clan and Kumryagir \nclan. While in the village there is Marga Kera, Putui, \nItungkir, Nyumbori, while in the village of Kriku there \nMenarga Marga and Marga Bewangkir. These clans \nrecognize the principle of decision-making that is the \nbirthright of a son (Patrenial). \nAlso in decision-making is not only based on the \ndecision of the Tribe Manam, but they will communicate \nwith other tribes around them like the tribe Ewir. In \nSenggi region there are several tribes, including Knap \nTribe, Mela Tribe, Nanai Tribe, Woi Tribe, Mangu \nTribe, and Tribe Wetlai. In this region the chief of the \ntribe oversees the Chairs of Keret. \nThe decision-making process on indigenous land \nuse begins with the customary village (Fin) meeting, \nwith the approval of the community and clan leaders \n(keret) of the customary land owners. In Kwansuvillage  \nthere are 5 (five) tribes of Waru, Bemai, Yaram, Bano, \nand Kwano. Each has a tribal chief and ondoafi.Dalam \ntraditional stratification Tribal heads play an active role \nto control the life of his tribe, while ondoafi role validate \nand protect the results of existing decisions. \nOn the other hand ondoafi can not make its own \ndecisions. If ondoafi takes his own decision then the \nconsequences will be death. The stratification of  is also \nseen in the life of the Balli tribe who inhabited the \nNimboran area. The clans in the Balli tribe are \nDemonggrang, Demotekai and Yaung. The customary \nstructure is seen with the selection of the Balli genus as \nIram which is determined by descent. All decisions are \ntaken jointly by the existing clan. \nIram's function is to give seriousness or confidence \nto all existing decisions. The decision-making process \nbegins by listening to the aspirations of the clans within \nthe Iram. The task of unifying the clan aspirations is the \ntask of a Tekai. Task Tekai as well as  advisor will be \nassisted Duneskingwou as  spokesman. Furthermore, in \nthe event -meeting  as a regulator of the event conducted \nby a clan Rum status. After all the decision of the \nmeeting is produced, Iram can not directly issue the \ndecree statement, but must hear from the clan with status \nBemai who is in charge of carefully assessing all \ndecisions that will be issued by Iram. \nIn this region, each tribe has a different Iram. If \nthere is one decision in one Iram, the other Iram can not \ninterfere with Iram's customary business. However, if the \ndecision concerns the territory under Iram's other \nauthority, coordination will be made between Iram \nbefore making a decision. The clues about the clan that \nbecame Iram in a region were conducted using a \npatristial hereditary approach. \nIn Beniekvillage  there are Sawa tribes. The Sawa \ntribe was led by the chief. Chiefs have played an \nimportant role since their ancestors existed. The concept \nof ondoafi had just been accepted by this tribe in the \nDutch era. Thus with the influence of the outside of the \ncustomary structure began to include ondoafi in the \ncustom stratification in this tribe. In addition there is a \ntribe in Gerusa Village Jack. In this ethnic life the role of \nondoafi is very dominant in decision making. \nDecision making is done following the \nstarlification of the cohesion. Ondoafi will consult with \nthe chiefs and clan heads before making a decision. In \n5\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n", ' \naddition there is a stratification in Village Santosa where \nthere is a general ondoafi and ondoafi clan. The \ndecision-making process takes place within the \ncustomary meeting, involving the clans (keret) within the \ntribe. \nThe role of the general odoafi is very active in the \ndecision-making process. In Tarvi village there are 5 \n(five) tribes namely Ondi (Taudufu), Bernepu, Kaisiu, \nFetowin and Taurui. Indigenous stratification shows that \nin the village of Tarvi the role of ondoafi is very active. \nOndoafi will consult with the customary land owner \nbefore making a decision. Ondoafi has more power to \nmake decisions because people believe that a direct, \ninner connection occurs between ondoafi and the spirits \nof the ancestors. \nFor example when someone breaks a ban ondoafi \nto go somewhere, and if violated it will appear storms at \nsea and on land, even though it was still the shady \nseason. In Sawesuma village there are 4 (four) tribes of \nTekbo, Digan, Tribe Jasa and Tribe Bungu. Each tribe \nhas a tribal chief, and above the tribal chief there are \nondoafi who play an active role in indigenous peoples. \nThe decision-making process is in the hands of ondoafi \nafter asking for consideration from each tribal chief. \n9 Permissive \nPermissive attitude is an open attitude in giving \npermission to the utilization of natural resources. \nDevelopment to be held in the territory of Tabi Mamta \nIndigenous Peopleis required to obtain permission from \ncustomary parties. The development plan to be held in \nTabi Mamta\'s customary territory of Ondoafi\'s \nleadership system is done in advance through \nnotification to the local government. \nFurthermore, the government convey the purpose \nof development to ondoafi, and ondoafi will convey to \nthe tribes and clans that have ulayat right on land yuang \nwill be used as media of development. \nIn indigenous communities Tabi Mamta the \nprocess of licensing of the  party starts from the talks \nconducted by families in a clan or called a rail. After the \nclans or clans in a family speak for themselves in their \nextended family and a decision is obtained, then the \nresult of the decision is brought by the chief to be \ndiscussed in the . Indigenous peoples will gather in the  \n(Obhe) to discuss the purpose of the development plan. \nOndoafi will invite heads of tribes and trolleys to \nattend and provide advice, feedback and opinions. \nSuggestions, inputs and opinions are given by first \nconsidering the customs and culture of the local \ncommunity. While in the Iram system, the decisionmaking\narrangement is carried out through a custom \nprocess involving the house\'s eyes (family in one clan), \ntribal chiefs, and clans appointed as spokespersons \n(Duneskingwou), advisors (Takai), organizers (Rum) As \nwell as the decision maker (Bemai). Such a decisionmaking\nprocess is called "The Process of Sincerity". \nIn Benyom village there are Kekri (Yantewo), \nTecuari Tribe, Bano Tribe and Kasmando Tribe. Each \ntribe has Iram and other devices respectively. The \nlicensing process begun with the holding of the meeting \nat the family or clan level then continued to the village \nlevel attended by indigenous peoples and Iram devices in \neach tribe. The highest decision is at customary meeting \nin village. Furthermore, one of the Tabi Mamta custom \nterritory Mix System between ondoafi and chiefs of \ntribal power occurs in the tribal region of Manam. \nIn this region there are companies that operate. The \ncompany when entering in the territory of the Manam \ntribe did not approach the chief or ondoafi residing in the \nvillage. Approach done by the company through local \ngovernment. The Tabi Mamta Customary Law Society \nof Manam felt that the presence of the company had \nbypassed the customary authority of the region. \nThere are 2 (two) conditions of permissive attitude \nshown by indigenous people in Amdal process. First, \nwhen indigenous and tribal peoples no longer have \nbargaining power over their natural resources. \nIndigenous and tribal peoples will be permissive of \ninvestors\' requests to exploit natural resources because \npreviously investors have licenses from the government. \nAs a result of not having the bargaining position, the \nIndigenous People is resigned in giving permission \nopenly. Second, when indigenous and tribal peoples feel \nfully involved in making decisions at the  level. \nThe result of the decision to grant permission will \nbe shown openly through the mechanisms occurring \nwithin the customary structure. The permissive attitude \noften encountered within the Tabi Mamta Indigenous \nPeopleis the first permissive attitude, where indigenous \nand tribal peoples are willingly and openly allowing \ninvestors to exploit their customary symbols because \ninvestors have received prior permission from the \ngovernment. \nThis situation will lead to conflicts in the future \namong indigenous peoples, among indigenous and tribal \npeoples with the government and investors. Therefore, \nbefore the customary community gives permission to use \ncustomary land, it needs to be mediated by the \ngovernment. So far, the mediation established by the \ngovernment through Musyawarah Pembangunan \n(Musrenbang) at the village level does not take into \nconsideration the results of decisions made by \nindigenous and tribal peoples in the  (Obhe). \nDevelopment Deliberation (Musrembang) in villages is \nonly normative, oriented towards securing government \nprograms. \nThus the needs of indigenous peoples from the \ncultural side are often not accommodated. For example \nthe need to preserve sacred customary lands, the need to \ninvest, the need to become masters on their own land, are \nthe things that are often ignored by the government. The \ngovernment is more oriented towards material \ndevelopment, infrastructure than development of cultural \naspects of Tabi Mamta indigenous people. Tabi Mamta \nIndigenous People has a habit since hereditary in giving \npermission of customary land use starting from para-para \nadat (Obhe). \nPara-para adat  (Obhe) is a place where people give \nsuggestions, opinions and responses to development \nplans that will be held in Tabi Mamta customary \nterritory. Suggestions, opinions and responses include \n6\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n', " \npermitting, rejecting development, until making any \ndecision on behalf of indigenous and tribal peoples. \n \n \n \n10 Continuity of Communication \nTabi Mamta Indigenous People is a Indigenous People \nthat is open in terms of communicating with outsiders. \nThe Tabi Mamta Indigenous Peopleholds 2 (two) \nprinciples, namely the principle of balance and the \nprinciple of relationship when meeting with outsiders \nwho will utilize Natural Resources owned by customary \nlaw community. \nThe outsiders are migrants from outside the \ncustomary law of Tabi Mamta. The principle of \nequilibrium in Tabi Mamta's Indigenous People implies \nthat unbalanced use of natural resources will bring \ndisaster to Tabi Mamta's customary law community, \nwhereas the relation is meant to be the brotherly \nrelationship between the Tabi Mamta  law community \nand the outsider is not a momentary relationship when \none The parties have felt benefited then left the \ncustomary party. \nFor that Communication between the Indigenous \nPeopleof Tabi Mamta with the immigrants done \ncontinuously, believes in the sense that there is a \nlearning process on the customary side and seriousness. \nIf these principles are not exercised by outsiders, what \nwill happen in Tabi Mamta's Indigenous Peopleis \nsuspicion and mistrust of outsiders. \nThe migrants enter the Tabi Mamta customary \nterritory in groups such as transmigrants from Java, Bali \nIsland and Nusa Tenggara Island. In addition there are \nalso migrants imported by the company such as PT. \nRimba Matoa Lestari, PT. Tandan Sawita Papua engaged \nin Oil Palm, PT. Semarak Timber is swarming in the \nfield of Forestry, PT. Berlin Krida Jaya engaged in the \nprocessing of Sago cultivation. \nSome companies enter the Tabi Mamta customary \nlaw area through licensing from both the District and \nCity governments. Communication between companies \nand customary law communities Tabi Mamta has little \nintensity and continuity, when compared to the intensity \nand continuity between the company and Provincial, \nDistrict and City Governments. This is evidenced by the \nloss of information on the presence of companies in the \nterritory of customary law of Tabi Mamta. \nThe Tabi Mamta Customary Law Society did not \nget any information about the presence of the company \nin the customary law of the Tabi Mamta community. For \nexample, the Tabi Mamta Indigenous People of the \nManam tribe, who wishes that everything related to the \nproblems between companies and indigenous peoples \nshould be continuously communicated. If the \ncommunication is interrupted it will potentially conflict. \nOne form of conflict that occurs is the result of the \ncompany's decision which then led to indigenous \npeople's discontent. This dissatisfaction will then lead to \nadversity leading to anarchist destructive activities. In \naddition, the form of communication that is expected by \nthe Indigenous People of Tabi Mamta Manam tribe in \nthe form of a proportional communication. This \ncommunication will occur if the company contacts \npeople based on existing custom structures. \nFor that the company or government must \nunderstand the people who are in the customary structure \nand have the authority to voice the voice of indigenous \npeoples. Such communication will result in decisions or \nagreements that can solve problems among the troubled \nparties. Misinformation in communication between \nindigenous peoples and companies or governments is \nusually due to some information that does not reach the \nparties in communication. \nFor that the initial process of communication must \nbe maintained sustainability. All information to be \ncommunicated is acceptable to all parties. For example, \noften the Indigenous People of Tabi Mamta Manam tribe \ndoes not know with whom to communicate, who is \nauthorized to make decisions in the organizational \nstructure of the company. \nSo often when the Indigenous People of Tabi \nMamta Manam tribe invites the Company and \nGovernment present together to discuss the problem, the \npresence is only represented by people in the company \nthat can not take decisions at that time. At the end of the \nmeeting there will be dissatisfaction with the resulting \ndecisions. To avoid a sense of suspicion and a high sense \nof respect for the Indigenous People Tabi Mamta Manam \ntribe, then the implementation of communication is not \nimplemented in large hotels \nThe Costumary Law Community Tabi Mamta \nManam tribe feel highly respected existence when the \ncommunication is done in the village customs. The  \nkampong is a place considered sacred by the indigenous \npeople of Manam tribe because of that place their \nancestors until the present generation held a meeting to \ndiscuss the existing customary issues. Often in the \nAmdal process there is an unsustainable communication \nbetween the Tabi Mamta Indigenous Peopleand the \ninvestor who will manage customary symbols belonging \nto the customary law community. Unsustainable \ncommunication will have an impact on the distrust of the \nTabi Mamta Indigenous People against other investors \nwho will enter to utilize custom symbols in the Tabi \nMamta customary territory. \n11 Reciprocity \nThe concept of repayment (reciprocity) does not apply in \nthe life of the Tabi Mamta Customary Law Community. \nThe concept of repayment in the form of assistance from \nthe company is opposed by the Tabi Mamta Customary \nLaw Community. The provision of assistance made by \nthe company that will invest in the Tabi Mamta \nCustomary Law Area is the company's effort to master \nthe customary rights of the Community. \nIn the Amdal Process in the Tabi Mamta region, \nthe concept of repayment will only bring suspicion \namong indigenous and tribal peoples, especially in the \nclans of ulayat owners. The suspicion of fellow clans \n7\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n", ' \nwill bring conflict in the Tabi Mamta customary law \ncommunity. The customary rights to land, water and all \nthe plants and animals that live therein are hereditary \nrights that can not be bought or replaced in the form of \ncompensation or material assistance. \nThe right is not a sole right but a right of \ncommunal or customary right inherited from generation \nto generation. In the ulayat right there is order which has \nbeen regularly inherited by the ancestors. The order has a \nMagical-Religius value especially related to the values \nof life\'s morality. For example, humans have a strong \nrelationship with the land due to human reasons derived \nfrom the soil. \nThere is also a view that the clan in certain tribes \nderived from the names of plants and animals. In \naddition there is also the view of the Indigenous People \nabout the importance of respecting the lake (the story of \nthe occurrence of Lake Sentani), rivers and springs \n(story of the occurrence of rivers coming from the \nCycloops mountains). Therefore the Tabi Mamta \nIndigenous Peopleconsiders that the compensation \nsystem or material aid as compensation for the use of the \nright to land, water and plants and animals which is \nabove it, is a capitalist system. \nTabi Mamta Indigenous People from generation to \ngeneration does not recognize the system of repayment \nwith migrants, foreigners and communities outside the \nTabi Mamta Customary Law Community. The \nreciprocity system applies only between families and \nclans in the Tabi Mamta customary law. This is \nevidenced by the existence of repayment system in the \nceremony of marriage, grief ceremony, and traditional \nceremonies associated with the ritual of honor to the \nancestors. Tabi Mamta Indigenous People viewed \nreciprocity among society with company or better known \nas compensation rights ulayat really not known in life of \ncustom law community Tabi Mamta. \nUsually the compensation made by an outsider \nbegins with a tap door compensation. The act of \ncompensation is an economic act that is very much \nagainst the customs and customs of the people. Such as \ntap door compensation, road and bridge compensation, \nscholarship compensation, traditional market \ncompensation, village development compensation are all \nsince the ancestors were not known in the Tabi Mamta \ncustomary law community. Indigenous and tribal \npeoples in meeting their economic needs are carried out \nwith a local cultural approach. Such as the exchange of \nlivestock products with the results of the garden in \nmeeting the needs of the wedding ceremony, grief and \nother ritual ceremonies. All this is done to maintain the \nprinciple of balance and principle of relations within the \nTabi Mamta customary law community. \nThe Indigenous People of Tabi Mamta holds that \nthe compensation given by outsiders to indigenous and \ntribal peoples is a form of outsourced tribute to the \nancestors and customs of Tabi Mamta customary law \ncommunity. However, what happens today is \ncompensation is a substitute for customary lands. When \nthe compensation took place for the Tabi Mamta \nIndigenous People was the beginning of the loss of rights \nto the lands given by their ancestors. Companies present \nin Tabi Mamta customary areas often approach with \nindigenous and tribal peoples by delivering promises to \nthe community As an example that occurs in the  \nterritory of Tabi Mamta Manama Tribe. \nThe company promises clean water network, \ncustoms like customary children, house building, every \nclan gets the help of four-wheeled vehicles, and \nlivestock assistance. All company\'s promises are \nsubmitted to the Indigenous People of Manam Tabi \nMamta. These promises if not fulfilled will potentially \nlead to a sense of distrust and conflicts that prolonged. \nTherefore, in response to the promises demanded by \nindigenous and tribal peoples, in a meeting between the \ncompany and the Indigenous People of Tabi Mamta of \nthe Manam tribe, the meeting must be attended by the \nchairman of the company who can take the decision at \nthe time. \nThus indigenous peoples feel highly appreciated, \nthe level of trust of indigenous peoples can be \nmaintained, and the level of suspicion will decline \nfurther. In Beniek village  there are Sawa tribes. In this \nregion often occurs communication between Sawa tribe \nwith existing companies. Assistance from companies is \noften given to the Sawa. Suku Sawa do not recognize the \nprocess of buying and selling land, which there is to \nprovide land for use by companies, not to own. Often the \ncompany promises promises that attract the attention of \nthe Customary Law Community. The promises are \nintended to enable the company to have customary land \nfor investment purposes. \nFor example, in the village of Gerusa the company \npromises to the Terss, Manoa, Jasa, Jack, Yess, Digam \nand Tetbo tribes, to be given 4 (four) hectares (Ha) of \nland to be owned by every household head. The fields \nwill be equipped with certificates. In Santosa village \nthere are Targualam, Yandu, Sasbe, Meigar, Kabri, \nWorto, Wakan and Tuku Owe. These tribes agreed \nbefore the exploitation of indigenous lands were required \nto do "gifts of door money" to those tribes. \nIn Sawesuma village there are also company \npromises of honorariums to be given to ondoafi, \neducational scholarships for village children. These \npromises are given by the company to the ondoafi with \nthe aim that customary lands can be utilized by the \ncompany. \n12 History of the Past \nThe history of the past about the failure of relations \namong firms investing in the territory of Indigenous \nPeoples had an impact on the existence of the Tabi \nMamta Customary Law Community. The failure of this \nrelationship greatly affects mental, character, \ncompetitiveness even psychology of society. In the \nAmdal Process there are promises set forth in the Amdal \ndocument as a form of community development program \nfrom the company to indigenous and tribal peoples. \nThese promises are often incompatible with the needs of \nthe Tabi Mamta customary law community. \nTabi Mamta Indigenous People has a life \nphilosophy Promise to keep, and Promise to be executed. \n8\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n', " \nPast failures between the company and the Tabi \nMamta Customary Law have the potential to cultivate \nsuspicion, distrust, pretense, and communication gaps. \nForms of past historical failures include companies only \ncommunicating with the government, many companies \nmaking promises to the public, using the apparatus \n(militarism) to intimidate some societies that do not \nsupport the presence of companies in the Tabi Mamta \ncustomary law. \nThis is felt by the Indigenous People Tabi Mamta \nTribe Manam where the promise to complete the Ropes \nof Love has not been implemented by the company. \nRopes of Love which will be completed gradually for 4 \n(four) Years with the value of each location of 10 Ha \nwill be given compensation of 20 Million. This decision \ncomes from the company itself not from indigenous \npeoples. Company promises that are often delivered and \nunsigned will increase indigenous peoples' distrust of the \ncompany. \nIn addition, the vagueness of the party responsible \nfor the promise is often experienced by the indigenous \npeoples of Manam Tribe. The unclear responsibilities \nwere strongly influenced by the political and economic \nsituation that existed at the time. For example, the \ncompany's promises as outlined in 9 (nine) forms are not \nthrough the process that has been practiced by \nindigenous peoples since their ancestors existed to this \nday. In this case indigenous peoples are involved when it \nis required by governments and companies to form \ncooperatives. \n13 Culture value \nThe Tabi Mamta Indigenous Peoplehas cultural values \nthat have been maintained to this day. Cultural values \nembedded in the life of the Tabi Mamta Indigenous \nPeople are manifested in respect for the existence of \ncustomary land, protection of forests with everything \nliving in them, the rivers of the sea and the coast. These \nvalues provide prosperity and comfort in the life of the \nTabi Mamta Customary Law Community. The cultural \nvalues of the Tabi Mamta Indigenous People are filters \nof new cultural values (diffusion, assimilation and \nacculturation) in the life of the Tabi Mamta Customary \nLaw community. \nIndigenous peoples of Tabi Mamta are \nstrengthening their cultural values through strengthening  \ninstitutional relationships, either in customary (Obhe) \ncustomary meetings, as well as family gatherings in \nclans (tribes) of each tribe. \nOne of the cultural values within the Tabi Mamta \nIndigenous Peopleis the Land Value of Indigenous \nPeople. Tabi Mamta Indigenous People does not \nrecognize the system of buying and selling custom land. \nCustomary land is an integral part of the customary \nstructure of Tabi Mamta Customary Law Community. \nSo when customary lands are sold then there will be a \nchange of power and authority within the customary \nstructure. In the EIA process in the Tabi Mamta \ncustomary area, there are often violations of cultural \nvalues of indigenous and tribal peoples. The cultural \nvalues of indigenous and tribal peoples are the value of \nland. \nOften companies assess low land by trying to \ncalculate the economy against the value of land. \nPotential conflicts arise when investors make land \ncompensation based on investor size. On the one hand, \nindigenous and tribal peoples are not given the \nopportunity to give value to the land in the EIA process \nbased on the view of the Tabi Mamta customary law \ncommunity. \nFor example the Value of Land in the Indigenous \nDemutru region. Tabi Mamta Indigenous People in \nDemutru customary area believe that Land is Mama or \nMother or in Nambloung language called Me. According \nto the teachings of  (Woi Iram), the land should be kept, \nprotected and not trafficked to foreigners. Whoever sells \nMe, to a stranger then he will be burned with the heat of \nthe sun, and his body will be eaten by worms and result \nin prolonged civil war. \nThe decision-making authority over Tanah  is on \nOndoafi, after receiving various inputs from the clans of \neach tribe within the village. Ondofolo has supra natural \npower, because ondofolo is considered by the Tabi \nMamta Indigenous People as the incarnation of god. The \nintroduction of new values in the form of the entry of \nreligion, science and technology into the cultural values \nof the Tabi Mamta customary law cause the weakness of \npower and authority of ondofolo. Customary order will \nshift, and experience the decline of values when it is \nbrought into the political and economic aspects. Even \nnot only the decline of values, but will lead to poverty. \nThe Costumary needs to be restored to pure, simple \nvalues, and uphold customs and appreciate customary \nleadership. Indigenous values that are still embedded in \npeople's lives are maintained and preserved. Such values \nare the religious values of a place (shrine), animals, \ntrees, water sources. These values still exist and are \nmaintained by the Tabi Mamta customary law \ncommunity. \nEvidence of customary values in environmental \nmanagement (Environmental Wisdom), among others, \nrestrict the collection of certain types of trees, the \ncollection of water at certain water sources that are only \nallowed for Ondoafi, Iram or Chief Tribe, hunting \nanimals such as Bird Cenderawasih Which is considered \na bird that comes from a god. Therefore, violations of \ncustomary  values are the responsibility of the \ngovernment. The command is responsible because the \ngovernment as the ruler has a development policy that is \nnot owned by the Tabi Mamta customary law \ncommunity. Therefore, the Government is responsible \nfor shifting customary values. \nOne form of government responsibility is to \nrecognize and restore the role of customary existence in \nthe customary order as the owner of natural resources. \nThe government conducts guidance, empowerment and \nstrengthening of the customary. Efforts to restore \ncustomary values and customs need to be sustainable. \nCustomary values will be a force for development. \nTraditional values existed before the Government and \nReligion. \n9\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n", ' \nAs an example before the existence of religious \nvalues entered into the customary order, then the values \nof trust have existed before. For example, the Metu Debi \nDeclaration contains custom values that are understood \nas a philosophy of "We Can Hold The Wheel, But Can \nNot Determine The Direction of Wind and Current". \nThe Tabi Mamta Indigenous People still holds the \nbasic principle of sovereignty over custom symbols in \nthe form of Natural Resources and everything contained \nwithin it. The values of beliefs are closely related to \ncustomary symbols. Utilization of  symbols will greatly \naffect the life order of indigenous peoples. For example, \nthe conflict between companies and indigenous peoples \nis due to the utilization that is done in places that are \nconsidered sacred by indigenous peoples. In addition, in \nthe customary order there are values of mutual \ncooperation. The value of gotong royong can be seen in \nthe loyalty of indigenous peoples to traditional leaders in \nindigenous villages. These values need to be reappointed \nby the government and investors. \nWith the inclusion of new cultural values into the \nlife of the Tabi-Mata customary law community, there is \na change of attitude and behavior of people in their lives. \nThe inclusion of village governance systems, Agrarian \nLaw, Forestry Law, information-technology, \ncommunications and migrants brought in by the \ngovernment and companies have brought significant \nchanges in the life of the Tabi Mamta customary law \ncommunity. \nChanged values such as the loss of customary \nstratification of a centralized village government on one \nleader (Ondoafi, Iram or Tribal Chief) are displaced by \nthe dualism of leadership, the headman and village head, \nthe displacement of the ulayat rights or the right of \ncollectiveness to the land to individual ownership The \nexistence of Agrarian law, the displacement of cultural \nutilization zone by Tabi Mamta Indigenous People such \nas sacred forest and forest that can be utilized is changed \nby the area of cultivation and protected area regulated by \nthe forestry law. The government has not yet screened \nnew cultural values that affect the cultural values of the \nTabi Mamta customary law community. The community \nhas not felt the strengthening of the government\'s base. \nThe strengthening of the base needed by the Tabi \nMamta Indigenous People is strengthening the \nknowledge of the Tabi Mamta Indigenous Peoplethrough \nformal and informal education level, besides that the \ncommunity wishes to strengthen the values of the land, \nstrengthening the change of cultural acculturation. \n14 Norms and Customary Sanctions \nThe Tabi Mamta Indigenous People still maintains \ncustomary norms in its life. The customary norms that \nare still maintained among others relate to customary \nland ownership. Form of customary norms that still \napply the rules of use ulayat land rights land, rivers, \nlakes, coastal and sea. The ownership of customary \nrights applies only to the clans, rags and tribes belonging \nto the  structure. \nIn the Amdal process it often does not \naccommodate all customary norms prevailing in the Tabi \nMamta customary area where investors will manage the \nsymbols of custom symbols. One example of customary \nnorms still prevailing in the life of the Tabi Mamta \nIndigenous Peopleis currently in the Demutru customary \nterritory. The customary norms relating to the \nmanagement of territories and natural resources are \nlisted in the Waidemuo Law (the Dematru Customary \nLaw) in Articles 4 and 5 stating "Do not take the goods \nof others without the permission of the concerned \npersons and do not rob people of other lands or gardens \nor families other". \nCustomary norms or customary rules prevailing in \nthe Indigenous Demutru region consist of the Laws of \nWaidemuo, Demutru and Mako. Waidemo\'s Law \nconsists of 6 (six) articles. Article 1 reads; Fear and \nhonor Wai Iram; Article 2, Fear and respect for parents; \nArticle 3, Do not covet the wives of other persons or \nwomen; Article 4, Do not take the goods of others \nwithout the consent of the person concerned; Article 5, \nDo not rob land and Article 6, Do not kill anyone else if \nit is not for violating Waidemuo\'s Law and other \ncustomary laws called Demutru. \nFurthermore, Demutru Law consists of 15 articles. \nArticle 1 reads; When people are anywhere in the world, \nWai-Iram always sees and cares for all his behavior and \ndeeds; Article 2, Grays or elders are the representatives \nof Wai Iram in this world; Article 3, It may see a \nwoman\'s tuning or feet but is not allowed to see and \nnotice the upper thigh calves of a woman because it is \nnot good; Article 4, It is possible to kill another person if \nhe uses his wife or seizes the land of a family\'s right; \nArticle 5, Must not undermine Iram\'s authority because it \ncan be killed; Article 6, People who are many mistakes \nand do no good, if they do not want to repent will be \nattacked by disease; Article 7 Each boy, starting at the \nage of twelve or less, must enter the dormitory at the \ninitiation house (Injo Yamo), which is nurtured by the  \ngovernment (in this case Iram, Bemai and Tekai as \nlearners). For adolescent males who do not go to \neducation can be killed by the Spirit or the Magical \nCreatures (Injo); \nAs for the things taught in the initiation house (Injo \nYamo) in the form of fighting skills, hunting, gathering, \nfarming, planting and other skills related to survival. \nArticle 8, Women are educated by mother and father at \nhome until adulthood; Article 9, carving and songs \nbelonging to one family (Tang) should not be followed \nby another family (Tang); Article 10, War only occurred \non the announcement of Iram who gave the mandate to \nPlo Iram (Commander of War); Article 11, All men shall \nbe educated as members of the armed forces; Article 12 \nEducation is nurtured by a container by the name of Injo, \nand those who run Injo are called Injo-Hlu; Article 13, \nthe crystal bracelet (Hamong) is held and stored by Iram. \nBracelet has the highest value and the most \nexpensive; Article 14, Everyone is not allowed to \norganize a major dance party event (Kebi) on a large \nscale because it is Iram\'s right; And Article 15 states that \nif any person continuously violates the provisions and \nhas committed a crime, if not repentant, although never \n10\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n', " \npunished or given advice then Duneskingwouw that is \nthe head of Tang or clan is entitled to kill him. Other \ncustomary norms are Law Makko. Makko's Law consists \nof 10 Articles. \nArticle 1 states that every person has the right to \ndevote to Wai-Iram; Article 2, If there is a gray or an \nelderly person sitting, you pass by in front of him or \ndefend him by squatting or sitting with him; Article 3, \nAn unmarried young man is forbidden to eat or drink and \nor to gather with married adults; Article 4 If a person \nkills another person for taking possession of his land, \nthen the plot of land shall be left to the damaged family \n(this is specific to the adjacent lands); Article 5, Iram is \nprohibited from eating and drinking with commoners or \ncommoners; Article 6, Iram's orders must be upheld \nwhenever continuous resistance must be punished; \nArticle 7, any adolescent or youth who misbehave \nbeforehand, when entering Injo Yamo's boarding school \nthen must be killed; Article 8, therefore the role of \nparents is required to foster or teach their children before \nentering boarding Injo Yamo; Article 9 A man may \nmarry if he has been able to perform the usual work of \nan adult such as making a garden, making a house, or \nshooting a pig. Likewise a woman if she can already \nplant in the garden and others; Article 10 states that \nmarriage must be accompanied by a dowry which is an \nentertainment for the discharge of a woman from the \nfamily (Tang), her family and relatives. \nIn addition, also found customary norms that are \nstill valid in the Community of  Law Tabi Mamta Moy \ntribe. Such norms are marriage laws called Kampug \ndaray; The law of protection of women called \nKampugyanggok; Forest protection law called Basyo \nnembut; The law of hunting is called maney nembut and \nlaw of Mutual cooperation called Krat. Further to this \nday, the Tabi Mamta Indigenous People does not \nrecognize private ownership of mainland land, rivers, \ncoastal lakes and seas. A form of violation of customary \nnorms is the transfer of land ownership of land, rivers, \nlakes, coastal and sea from indigenous communities to \nprivate ownership. For example, land ownership is \nowned by individuals and companies. \nThis violation will be followed by custom sanction \nwhich is granted by the customary party in this case the \nowner of customary rights against the party who \nsurrenders the customary land to the company or \nindividual. The sanctions are in the form of alienation \nfrom the Tabi Mamta Indigenous People by excluding all \ncustomary processes that are taking place in the Tabi \nMamta Customary Law Community. Tabi Mamta \nIndigenous People does not recognize custom sanctions \nin the form of compensation. This is because the \ncompensation provided by the company or individual to \nthe ownership of customary lands is contrary to the \ncustomary values that the land is a common property and \ncan not be traded. \nBusiness values can not enter in traditional values \ndue to different color spectra. The Indigenous People of \nTabi Mamta recognizes sanctions derived from ancestors \nand ancestral spirits, and sanctions derived from nature. \nThe concrete form of the sanctions can not be seen but \nthe consequences of the application of sanctions can be \nseen with the sacrifice of life. The stronger the belief of \nthe Tabi Mamta Indigenous People is the higher the \nvalue of the fine or sanction given. For example, the \ndisplacement of some sacred places in the customary \nterritory of Tabi Mamta Manama Tribe gives high \ncustomary sanction in the form of a fine of hundreds of \nmillions to companies doing eviction. \nThe place is considered sacred because according \nto the belief of the tribe of Manam there is the place of \nthe first human existence of their ancestors, and they \nassume that the spirits of their ancestors still exist today. \nIn addition, custom sanctions are granted to companies \nthat do not fulfill their promises to the Tribal Peoples \nTabi Mamta Manuku Community. For example the \ncompletion of the Ropes where the value of the Rope of \nLove that should be determined by the Tribal Law \nCommunity of Tabi Mamta Manama Tribe based on \ncustomary values applicable, but the value is determined \nby the company. Furthermore, in the region of the Balli \nTribe who know the customary structure of Iram, there \nare sanctions for those who violate customary rules. In \nthe event of a violation of customary regulations, the \napplicable sanctions are murder. \nWhile in the life of the Waru tribe of Kwansu \nvillage, in case of violation of, the sanction process will \nbe handed over to the  council. Furthermore, the  council \nled by the head of the tribe will take decisions after \ntalking with the clans that exist. In Beniek village there \nare Sawa tribes. This tribe does not recognize the system \nof buying and selling custom land. Suku Sawa never \nsells customary land, but allows their customary land to \nbe used for development. Conflict often occurs when \ncompanies insist on buying customary land, especially \nlands that are considered sacred. \nWhile in the region of Senggi there are customary \nnorms that regulate the sacred places that should not be \nviolated. In the event of a violation it will be subject to \ncustom sanctions. Customary sanctions are death. \nCustomary norms that exist in Santosavillage  still valid \nwith the ceremonies of marriage customs. The marriage \ntreasures are Tomakobatu, beads and axes. Customary \nsanctions are given to those who violate marriage \ncustoms such as in the right and left thighs or other \nphysical laws. While in Sawesuma village there is a \ntraditional ceremony of marriage with marriage property \nin this region in the form of Bracelet, Stone ax and \nMasete (a kind of bone which both ends are flattened). \n15 The Customary Leadership \nThe environmental feasibility decision-making process \noften ignores processes that should be done through \nmechanisms that apply to Tabi Mamta's customary law \ncommunity. The focus of environmental feasibility \ndecision-making is more focused on the mechanisms \noccurring within Amdal Commission Meetings. On the \nother hand the process of taking through customary \nmechanisms is neglected. The decision-making process \nthrough customary mechanisms follows the customary \nstructures within which there is a customary \nstratification which is highly respected by indigenous \n11\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n", " \nand tribal peoples. All customary decision-making \nprocesses are conducted through customary consultation. \nIndigenous deliberations are conducted through the \nmechanisms (paths) of the path of the cohesion. The \nmechanism takes place in the customary (Obhe) with the \ninvolvement of clans, rags and tribes within the \ntraditional structure. \nCustomary symbols are customary land, forest, \nwaters and other natural resources under the power of \nondoafi. Ondoafi is a leader in charge of serving \nindigenous and tribal peoples. In the Tarvi region, the \nrole of ondoafi is very active. Legal issues that occur in \nthe village must be known and the permission of \nondoafi. Ondoafi is considered to have magical powers \ndue to having a relationship with the ancestors. Ondoafi \nis considered to have supernatural powers that can bring \ndeath to a person. In addition, ondoafi is considered to \nrecover people from illness through communication with \nthe ancestors. All custom meetings or traditional \nceremonies are held in the ondoafi house. Above ondoafi \nthere is Tribal Council (DAS) which serves to coordinate \nthe ondoafi in every village. \nThe Chairman of the Watershed Council is \nconsidered to be the general Ondoafi who oversees the \nvillage's ondoafi. Furthermore, the villageâs ondoafi \noversees the tribal chiefs in the village of Tarvi, Muaib, \nYogapsa, Ambora, Little Muris, Great Muris (Yokari) \nand Demta. \n16 Religion \nThe Tabi Mamta Indigenous People is very respectful of \ntheir ancestors. Community religious life is reflected in \nthe life of each family. Families still believe in places \nthat are considered sacred. Belief in the existence of \nancestors is felt by the Tabi Mamta customary law \ncommunity. Especially when the natural resources of \nland, water, forest and life are disturbed by the incoming \ninvestment and change the order of the close relationship \nbetween the life of the people of Tabi Mamta customary \nhulum with nature and ancestral spirits. The beliefs of \nthe people who have been to the sacred places in the \nTabi Mamta customary area still exist and are planted in \nevery generation. Problems often occur when places \nconsidered sacred are used by outsiders who do not \nunderstand the cultural background. This is often the \ncase with the Amdal process, where the places \nconsidered sacred by indigenous and tribal peoples are \nneglected due to the lack of investor's understanding of \nthe importance of sacred places. \nOn the other hand indigenous people believe the \nsacred places are considered to have high religious \nvalues. These places are considered to be the place \nwhere the first human existed, the place is considered \nthat the ancestors still live up to the present time. These \nplaces are considered to be the place where the ancestral \nspirits reside, where the demons dwell even ordinary \nplace is where the former tribal war occurred. In this \nplace also Chief Tribe can call the spirits of ancestors \nwho died when the tribal war occurred. In the area of  \nNimbugresi village  there is a tribe of Levi. This tribe \nstill holds the belief that certain places in the indigenous \nterritory lies with ancestral spirits. \nThe guidance of the ancestral spirits is the \nexistence of a very sacred old village. Anyone who \nenters the area if they do not get permission from \nondoafi will get custom sanctions. The customary \nsanction of a fine is determined by custom. As a result of \na fine that is not resolved, then the concerned can not \nspeak anymore (mute). The forms of fines are \nTomakobatu (Uda), and Beads (Ngoi). In the Genyem \nvillage region there is the Balli Tribe. The tribe of Balli \ngives the sanction of murder or the person will lose his \nmemory forever in the event of a violation of the sacred \nplaces. The sacred places were determined by the Balli \ntribe based on the belief that the place used to form the \ncrossroads and even the settling places of the ancestors. \nAncestral spirits are believed to have been transformed \ninto trees, stones, wood, and spirits. Due to the ancestral \nspirits dwelling in the place then the place is highly \nvalued for generations. In this region only Iram can \ncommunicate with the ancestral spirits. \nThe form of communication is done by speaking \ndirectly with the ancestral spirits. The Indigenous \nPeopleassumes that their ancestral spirits heard when the \ncommunication took place. Communication and spiritual \ncontact can not occur between the owner of the \ncommunal right elsewhere with the local ancestral \nspirits. In Kwansu village a strong relationship exists \nbetween nature and indigenous peoples. Chief or ondoafi \ncan communicate with nature using mother language \n(Soil Language). The characteristics of the land language \nare usually seen from naming the names of places, \nvillages, rivers or water sources, and usually those names \nare associated with the origin of humans in the region. \nNot everyone can communicate like this. The ability to \ncommunicate with nature occurs from generation to \ngeneration according to the right of inheritance \n(patrinial). \nInheritance is hereditary, if the head of the tribe or \nondoafi not memiilki boy, then the right of inheritance \nfell on the younger brother and so on. In addition in the \nTabi Mamta customary territory there is a village of \nGerusa. In this area there are places that are considered \nsacred places. Sacred places are usually dintandai with \nthe forest protected by indigenous peoples. Customary \nsanctions that occur when there are people who enter the \nregion will be dipanah thigh. In the village of Tarvi there \nare sacred places that are determined by indigenous \npeoples. A place is used as a sacred temple because the \nplace is believed to be where their ancestors rest when \ntraveling long. For that the places are highly appreciated \nby the local community. In case of violation in sacred \nplaces it will be sanctioned by custom sanction of \ncustom size. In the village of Sawesuma there are sacred \nplaces. \nThe sacred places are shaped hills covered with \ntrees. Trees that have been marked with clear signs such \nas red paint. The sacred places are highly respected by \nindigenous peoples. In the event of violation of sacred \nplaces, it will be subject to physical sanctions for those \nwho violate it. Contextual of each of the above social \nand cultural variables in the AMDAL process can be \n12\nE3S Web of Conferences 31, 08017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183108017\nICENIS 2017\n", " \nclearly seen in the description of the dynamics of \nenvironmental feasibility decision making in the EIA \nprocess that occurred in the Tabi Mamta Indigenous \nPeople in Papua Province. \n \n \n \n17 Conclusion \n1. Indigenous Peoples Tabi Mamta is a community of \nCustomary Law that still has territorial custom \nterritory, genealogically has kinship, has customary \nvalues and norms and sanctions, possesses cultural \nobjects, and has environmental wisdom in \nmaintaining the existence of Symbols Custom in \nthe form of Natural Resources. \n2. In the socio-cultural system of customary law \ncommunities there are components such as  \nstratification, permissiveness, communication, \nreciprocity, past history, cultural values, customary \nnorms and sanctions, religious and  leadership. \n3. Components in a socio-cultural system constitute a \nunity resulting from the interaction between \nindividuals and groups in order to prevent the \noccurrence of environmental damage and \ndisruption to the existence of environmental and \nnatural resource functions. \n4. Components in the socio-cultural system of \nindigenous and tribal peoples play a role in the EIA \nprocess in the Tabi Mamta customary area \nespecially in the environmental feasibility decision \nmaking process. \n5. Natural resources are considered as ancestral \nsymbols inherited from ancestors from generation \nto generation. \nBibliograph  \n1. Afrizal. Metode Penelitian Kualitatif.
