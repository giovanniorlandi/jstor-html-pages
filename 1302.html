By this proviso,\nthe President was enabled t<\ngrant tariff relief where existing\nduties did not comply with the\ntheory of equalizing costs of pro j\nduction at home and abroad.\nThe proviso was added to hush\nthe individuals who are always;\ndemanding scientific tariff -mak-l\ning. Nobody paid much atten-j\ntion when it was enacted, and j\nthe country set back to extract\nwhat consolation it could from\nthe fact that it knew the worst, j\nBut now, after several months,\ncomes the “flexible” proviso.!\nAnd scrutiny of the appeals for]\nits application may well arouse\nthe suspicion that the worst isi\nyet to come. It seems that meni- j\nhers of the tariff board were di-i\nvided on the act’s interpretation.\nOne group, headed by W illiam\nS. Culbertson, vice-chairman,\ncontended that the commission 1\nheld the power to initiate a re\nvision of the entire tariff act.]\nAnot he r group, headed by j\nThomas O. Marvin, the chair\nman, maintained that the board\ncould act only on suggestion of\nthe President. The President,\nlias finally broken the deadlock\nby ordering the commission to!\nproceed with the adjustments\nnecessary under the “flexible”\nclause.\nAnd here seems to he the hitch\nin it: There are 110 applications]\nfor relief; and more than two\nthirds of them are for increases\nin the duty.\nThus it begins to appear that\nthe 9op thrown to those protest\ning against the high tariff law,\nin the shape of tin* “flexible” pro\nviso, is a means whereby still\nhigher rates may he imposed. In\ntheory, nothing like this should\nhappen. However, "it is the rec\nord of all tariff legislation that\nthe interests which will benefit\nare represented In able, clever\ngentlemen who can present to the\nrate-making body books of sta\ntistics and unlimited arguments\nfor their contentions. But the\nconsumer who will pay the bill\ndoes not appear.\nOne of the typical items for\nwhich rate relief has been asked\nof the tariff hoard is on cotton\nhoisery for infants now calling\nfor a 50 per cent, ad valorem\nduty. The consumer will not\ncontest the increase, because he\nwill not be called upon or con\nsulted.\nTHE RADIO AND JAZZ\nt omposers r.::d publishers of\npopular music, vocal and instru\nmental, with particular reference\nto jazz, recently organized to at\ntempt to restrict the broadcast\ning of their productions by radio.\nNotice has been given to broad\ncasting stations that they will be\nheld financially liable for viola\ntion of copyrights.\nAn attorney for the producers\nof music appeared before the\nradio conference in Washington\nand informed the members of the\nconference that action would be\ntaken against all persons making\nuse of copyrighted music without\npermission.\nRepresentatives of the music!\nproducers state that sales of rec-j\nords and sheet music had fallen!\noff greatly since radio has he-J\ncome so popular. Dances arc!\nheld hundreds of miles from the!\norchestra which is playing, the;\nmusic being received by “ radio j\nthrough an amplifying horn.ji\nThis alone is said to have re-! 1\nduced greatly the sales of orches-j •\nj tra music.\nEven the most reckless, in pre\ndicting the future of radio, have\nj not pro]diesized that it would\nI kill jazz The financial lure is]\nI what .spurs on individuals who\nturn out monstroßities which,\nI few of average intelligence would]\n; cqll “music.” If radio deals a\ndeath blow to many of these pro-1\nAuctions it will have served man-]\nkind well indeed.\nMARKS HELP TO\nIDENTIFY AUTOS\nLocking Devices Are Good Pro\ntection Against Depredations\nof Meddlesome Bovs.\nFEW CARS ARE WELL LOCKED\nProfessional Thief Discards License\nPlates, Changes Car and Eng ne\nNumbers and Obliterates\nEvery Mark.\n• It Is believed lhat at least one auto\nmobile out of every dozen iuunufuo>\ntured und sold is stolen. How many\nstolen machines are ever recovered by\ntheir rightful owners is another ques\ntion.\n(Joud locking devices or thief sig\nnals are not to be despised. They are\na sure protection against depredations\nbv meddlesome boys, ami will eause\nfne automobile thief so much trouble\nthat he will look for a ear that 1*\neasier to toko away. Where several\nj rare are parked this will not be hard\nlo find. Comparatively few ears are\nleft well locked, and many R*nnd\nwithout being locked at all. Owners\nsometimes forget to take the switch*\nkey with them, leaving it in the switch\nlock.\nWork of Professional.\nShould a professional automobile\nthief get your car, he will take good\nrare that you will no*, recognize It\n; should you see It again. You know\nIt now chiefly by its license plates, car\nand engine numbers, and a few\nscratches, dents and slight peculiar!-\n! ties.\nHe dlscnrds the license plqtes,\nchanges the engine and car numbers\nand obliterates every mark by which\nyou might identify your car. Caution\nIs Ids middle name.\' He likes to tear\ndown several care of the same make\nand reassemble them so that no two\n, of their principal parts will be found\nIn any one car together. He has\nlo<deed everything over with great care\ni to see whether your Initials are hid\nden under u washer, or whether there\nare prick-punch holes anywhere con\ni coaled. I.est you identify some\nscratch or dent he may use new fend\n: ers and repaint the car.\nWay to Secure Car.\nIf you could mnke a decisive lden\ntllh-ation of a body, frame, engine,\ngenr case, rear axle housing or front\nuxle, you would a*and the best kind of\na chance to take that car away from\na crowd of claimants, even If your\nmarkings could be found on but one\nof these parts.\nHow near can we come to a system\nof Invisible markings, unlikely of\nchance duplication, and readily dis\ncoverable by the owner or someone\nauthorized by him? Tltere Is safety\nIn numbers. Several markings on\neach part mnke It less likely that all\nran he obliterated.\nNote of Secret Marks.\nl ake, for an example, *he following\nmemorandum of a secret mark: “734\nin. horizontally to the left of center of\nthe right engine suspension bolt,\nscrape off the paint and find a drilled\nhole filled with lead."\nI? you have several such marks,\nrarefully recorded, on different parts\nf the frame, your identification will\nbecome more positive, as It is highly\nimprobable that two or more of these\nmarks would be accidentally dupli\ncated by some other person.\nMany other methods of marking the\ncar will suggest themselves to the in\nventive owner. It must be remem\nbered. however, that secret identifica\ntion marks are worthless unless they\nnre carefully and exactly recorded and\na record of them preserved.—Henry R\nTnayer in Popular Sclencs Monthly.\nA LAST REP- __ __\nUGE.\nHis Wife: New* p£’/|\ner mind.

It ,\nwas the first remark Ltoctor Jumeson j\nhad made that had attracted his at- j\nu ntion. j I\n•’The magic **L wishing," the lec- ,\nturer went on. “That\'s what you j\nmight rail U—for its power is often ,\nmagical, und 1 could cite hundreds\nof rases where the effect has been al\ntuost miraculous. Just get the Image i\nof the thing you want tn your mind\nand dwell upon it. Think of It fre\nquently uiul see it clearly and work\nfor it. Make your every aim a step\nping stone toward that one goal.\nDon\'t get the idea that all you have\nto do Is to pray for it; the Lord helps\nthose who help themselves. Combine\nthe two —wishing and working.\n“That’s all today. Thank you."\nAmid a short, enthusiastic spatter\nof upplause the lecturer left the plat\nform und John Winton slowly worked\nids way out of the room with the\ncrowd.\n’Pretty good lecture, eh, Winton?\nYou know, I believe there’s something\nin that wishing business."\n’ I\'m inclined to think so, too," John\nanswered.\n"Yes, und to wish loud enough\nshould lie put into the requirements.\nSome folks want a thing they could\nhave for the asking, but they dou\'t\nknow how to ask."\nWinton gat>ed at Macmillan.\n"I wonder If that Isn’t my case,” he\nsold, after a pause.\n"Your case\'. Phew! You’ve never\niviinted a thing in your life. You\'re\ntlie luckiest young chap I ever knew.\nYou’ve got brains and an education\nand money and social position. How\nmuch more do you want?"\n“I’d give it ull for one thing that I\nhaven’t."\n“You won’t have to—Just wish for\nit hard enough nnd long enougii and\nloud enougii and you’ll get it.”\n“Do you really believe that?’’ asked\nthe other man eagerly.\n“Sure I do. I’ve been here longer\nthan you have and I’ve seen It work\ntoo many times.”\nThey were now on the steps of the\nbuilding.\n“Well, I’ve certainly wished for It\nlong enougii nnd hard enough,"\nlaughed the younger man.\n"How long and how hard?"\n“Harder than I ever wished for\nanything in my whole life and every\nday for nearly three years.”\n“It must be a case of loud enough\nthen."\n"1 know It wouldn’t do any good,”\nthe other replied dolefully.\n“No harm in trying," his friend an\nswered hopefully. “Well, so long—\nsee you at the club tonight?”\n“ ’Fraid not. I have an engage\nment.”\n“And loud enough.” The words rang\nin John\'s ears all the afternoon. But\nwhat earthly use was there in being\nloud when you knew it was no good?\nHadn’t Alice Moore as good as told\nhim a thousand times she was in love\nwith Bob Caldwell? And didn’t she\nrave over all he did and said? Why\nhumiliate oneself unnecessarily? Who\nwanted to lie thrown down, anyway?\nIf only she had given him one tiny\natom of encouragement, but Instead —\nLoud enougii. The idea floated\nthrough his mind again. He certainly\nhad not been very loud about It. Just\nto disprove the theory he would he.\nWhat If he did get humiliated? He\ncould stand it and no one would ever\nknow except Alice. She certainly\nwas not the kind of girl to boast\nabout her proposals.\nAs be walked up the front steps of\nthe Moore home that night his knees\nnearly gave way beneath him, but the\nimpassive servant evidently noticed\nnothing as lie took his hat and gloves\nand showed him Into the library. In a\nmoment Alice would he there. In an\nother moment he would he telling tier\n—in another she would he turning\nhim down gently hut firmly. He must\ndo It the second she came In or he\nwould lose all cov.rage.\nJohn Winton was not a professional\nproposer. But he evidently got his\norder of procedure mixed for at the\nfirst sight of her he took her In his\narms nnd muttered and stammered\nsomething or other about love and\nmarriage. To his utter surprise she\nmade no effort to free herself, but hid\nher face on his shoulder and slipped\ntwo timid arms around his neck.\n"Do you know," said Alice after a\nwhile, “I heard a wonderful lecture\nthis afternoon by a Doctor Jameson\nand he said that you could get any\nthing you wanted If you wished for it\nhard enough and long enough—and I\nbelieve it’s true. I—l wished for\nsomething terribly hard and I got it\ntoday.”\nJohn held her closer nnd kissed the\nsoft brown hair.\n"But you must always be sure to\nwish loud enough, too, dear,” she\nlaughed.\nAdditional Cleansing.\nIn a city noted for its industrial\ngrime.

Last year, for example, there was a\nnet increase of 8,400 telephones in die state.\nTo secure this net increase, however, the gross\nnumber of telephones installed was 24,500 —\nthe difference between the gross number and\nthe net number being the telephone# discon\ntinued.\nThese new telephones require extensions to .\nthe telephone plant—additional wires, poles,\nconduits, cables, central office switchboards\nand equipment, sometimes new buildings and\nalways telephone instruments and associated\napparatus.\nOur investment in telephone plant, thero\nfore, grows greater and greater each year. We\nare now anticipating the future service require\nments of the State of Maryland and are nuking\nplans for the extensions necessary. The accom\npanying chart shows how our investment in\nMaryland has mounted since 1900 and what\nwe expect it to be at the end of 1927, five\nyears hence.\n\\‘-,\' • j r\'\nThese constant extensions mean a constant\nrequirement for new capital. This must coma\nfrom persons who have money to invest, and\nonly those industries which can earn enough\nto pay a fair return for the use of tins money\ncan expect to attract the investor.\nTo be prepared to meet Maryland’s + 34000,000.\ntelephone requirements we must, there- ~ ■\nfore, earn a sufficient return to attract\ndie necessary new capital.\nThe Chesapeake and Potomac\nTelephone Company\ntl Baltimore City I\n4W2SLOOOI\n■ I I I\n1900 1905 1910 1915 1920 1922 1927\n; Hew Fatigue Artoally The 1\nSj steal\nThe product of fatigue is an actual\nj poison.

Dr. A. Messo, of\nthe University of Turin, brought the\nfirst facts to light in the last de\ncade. Experimenters are still work\ning to discover more facts about\nthem. Meanwhile other groups have\nworked on the problem of eliminat\ning overfatigue from work. That is j\na fascinating job. They have accom-;\npiished much and they have dug out\n1 facts that every one who ever lifts\na finger ought to know- and utilise.\nPractically any one can easily learn\nhow to do his own work with much\nless effort—how to work without gen\nerating nearly so much poison in your\ntissues, how to win your own battle\nagainst the very real danger of over\nfatigue.\nControlled experiments made upon\nlarge numbers of women working at\nall types of task have shown that to\ni prevent overfatigue you must rest at j\n!% Just think what .\nyou’ve been missing/\nTWTANY P*°P le den y themselves the comfort\nXVX of a hot drink with meals, because they\nf V find coffee and tea detrimental to health.
