        <pre>['Journal of\nAdolescence\nJournal of Adolescence 27 (2004) 755–759\nBook reviews\nScott Turner Jeffrey (Ed.), Dating and Sexuality in America, ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, CA,\nUSA, 2003, price $45 (Hbk); $50 (E-Book), 287pp.\nThis reference text provides an overview of the evolution of contemporary adolescent dating\nand sexual behaviours, the cultural and technological factors that influenced their evolution, and\nthe implications of that evolution. The text begins with a discussion of how cultural beliefs and\nvalues influence the social process of dating. Jeffrey Scott Turner notes that although this\nphenomenon occurs in most societies around the world, dating traditions, customs, and practices\nvary across different groups of people.\nChapter 1 takes the reader on an historic journey of the events influencing modern day dating\nand sexual behaviours. Highlighted are the roles of important events such as industrialization,\nWorld War II, and the sexual revolution.\nIssues and controversies such as rape, birth control, and same-sex dating are explored in Chapter 2.\nAlthough the nature of a reference text precludes detailed discussion of each issue, references to\norganizations, associations, agencies, texts, journals, and videos where additional information can be\nsought are provided in subsequent chapters. The interested reader is also provided with the\nbiographical sketches of over 30 noted adolescent development and human sexuality researchers and\na chapter devoted to relevant data and facts regarding adolescent dating and sexuality.\nThe focus of the text is on dating among American adolescents. However, a global perspective\nis provided in Chapter 3, devoted to the dating customs, adolescent marriage rates, adolescent\ncontraceptive use, and adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease rates in 13 other\ncountries and regions of the world including China, the Middle East and North Africa, Sweden,\nand the Russian Federation. Chapter 4 presents a detailed historical chronology of what Turner\nrefers to as the ‘‘innovations, milestones, and government legislation shaping adolescent dating\nand sexuality’’ spanning from 1900 to present day.\nThis text is an excellent resource for high school and college students as well as the general\npublic. Policy makers dealing with issues surrounding adolescent sexuality could also find this text\nuseful. Jeffrey Scott Turner whets his readers’ appetites and provides numerous references to\nadditional information and materials for those interested in learning more about adolescent\ndating and sexuality in America.\nAlexandra Loukas\nDepartment of Kinesiology & Health Education,\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, USA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/jado\ndoi:10.1016/j.adolescence.2004.06.011\n']</pre>
