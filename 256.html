        <pre>['410 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1927\nground, and all the treaties that Prance \nmay negotiate will not stay the tide.\nA  few hundred miles away lies Russia, \nprodigious and incalculable. As the crow \nflies, Moscow is only as far from Paris as \nSt. Louis is from New York, but spiritually \nit is at the antipodes. It cannot be ignored, \nnor can it be controlled by the thumbing \nof noses or the shouting of unpleasant epi\xad\nthets. While the danger of the extension \nof the Communist system, so far as it ever \nexisted, is pretty well over, the power is \nthere and it cannot fail to influence the \nfuture. The sphere of influence of Prance, \nsharing as it does so long a boundary, \ncannot escape being affected by it.\nThe best argument for the acceptance of \nthe Versailles treaty was that it supplied \nsome sort of a platform on which Europe \ncould stand while she bound up her wounds \nand attempted to re-establish herself. As \ntime goes on, the insecurity of the founda\xad\ntions and the weakness of the structure \nbecome more and more evident. It is \ngradually being rebuilt, and it stands today \nbecause, outside of Russia, every one is in\xad\nterested in propping it up. If it should \nfall, the consequences are not pleasant to \ncontemplate. The French treaties are do\xad\ning something to prevent its decay; but, \nmeanwhile, the carpenters and the masons \nare still at work.\nThe League of Nations Month by Month\nBy A R T H U R  SW EETSER\nF ORMALLY October is a quiet month \nfor the League of Nations, devoted \nto detailed execution of the Assem\xad\nbly decisions and recuperation from its se\xad\nvere strain. To begin with, the delegations \nwhich have been in Geneva, many of them \nfor five weeks, scatter to their different \ncountries to resume their work at home, \nsome, as in Switzerland and Scandinavia, \nto prepare formal public documents on the \nAssembly and others to prepare speeches \nfor parliamentary discussion, in order that, \nas far as possible, the results at Geneva \nmay be assimilated into the national con\xad\nsciousness. Similarly the central services \nof the League are burdened with the intri\xad\ncate cleaning-up work which necessarily re\xad\nmains after a month’s world conference \ncovering practically every field of interna\xad\ntional life. Those services are faced not \nonly with completing the minutes and rec\xad\nords, but with sending out hundreds of let\xad\nters and documents, whether universally to \nall States or individually to different Gov\xad\nernments, organizations or individuals.\nThis Fall, however, as during the Sum\xad\nmer, the League’s greatly accumulating \nwork made it unavoidable for a series of \nconferences and committees to encroach \neven upon this limited period. For instance, \nthere was one large plenipotentiary con\xad\nference of thirty-three States, including the \nUnited States, on Import and Export Re\xad\nstrictions; several other Economic Commit\xad\ntees on Counterfeiting Currency, Tariff No\xad\nmenclature, Inland Navigation, Maritime\nTonnage and the Austrian Loan; the con\xad\nclusion of an extraordinary session on \nOpium; and the beginning of regular ses\xad\nsions of the Mandates and Health Commit\xad\ntees. In other words, hardly had the Pres\xad\nident’s gavel fallen at the Assembly than \nthe coming year’s work was in full swing.\nImport and Export Restrictions—Most \nimportant of the meetings held was the In\xad\nternational Diplomatic Conference on Im\xad\nport and Export Restrictions, which, in \nopening a convention for signature and rat\xad\nification, marked a turning point in years \no f effort to do away with this war diffi\xad\nculty. The question was raised at the Brus\xad\nsels Conference in 1920, carried on through \nthe Porto Rosa, the Genoa and the Geneva \nConferences; discussed by various com\xad\nmittees and organizations, such as the Inter\nnational Chamber of Commerce, and \nfinally reduced to a draft form which in \nturn went the rounds of the Governments \nand various industrial and commercial cir\xad\ncles. These restrictions were found to be \ndue to destruction of economic equilibrium, \nneed of indispensable raw material, protec\xad\ntion of national defense industries, strug\xad\ngles against the rise in prices and wages \nand defense of the trade balance and ex\xad\nchanges. Experience had shown, however, \nthat their advantages by no means offset \ntheir drawbacks. Yet where at the outset \nthe conference was felt not to be difficult, \nit shortly developed that no more funda\xad\nmental problems exist than those arising \nfrom relations of the great economic unities\n', 'THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS 411\none with another. The States were forced \nto recognize, therefore, that individual sac\xad\nrifices were necessary in order that the gen\xad\neral diminution of these restrictions by \nmass action might give each member of the \ninternational community more than it had \nlost. Even at that, however, complete, im\xad\nmediate agreement was not possible in some \nspecific cases, and it was decided that, \nwhile the conventions marked a great for\xad\nward step, the work of the conference \nshould not be considered as finished.\nCounterfeiting of Currency—Another in\xad\nteresting economic question came a step \nnearer solution when a Mixed Committee of \nSecret Service and Treasury officials com\xad\npleted a Draft Convention for international \naction against the counterfeiting of cur\xad\nrency. This draft, to be submitted to the \nCouncil of the League in view of a pleni\xad\npotentiary international conference to adopt \na final convention, aims to clarify the defi\xad\nnition of counterfeiting, to fill any gaps in \ndomestic legislation which permit a criminal \nto escape punishment and to quicken police \naction by better organization within States, \nby periodical conferences between police \nand banks of issue and by the creation \nof an International Central Information \nOffice.\nCustoms Nomenclature—Another step \ntoward the execution of the decisions of the \nEconomic Conference was taken in a meet\xad\ning for the unification of customs nomen\xad\nclature in order to reduce the purely formal \nand administrative difficulties which now \nharass international trade. This commit\xad\ntee, consisting of customs experts, had \ndrawn up last August the principles of a \ngeneral plan covering all classes of goods \non which the new nomenclature should be \nbased. At this session it studied what ef\xad\nfects the application of these principles \nwould have on certain specific and highly\nHevftloped t a r i f f s , to  w h ich  th o y  h a d , in\ntest, been applied. Similarly, two other \ncommittees met to discuss, in one case the \nunification of statistics in inland naviga\xad\ntion, and in the other the unification of \ntonnage in maritime navigation, both of \nwhich are of considerable importance in \nquickening and improving international \ntrade and communications.\nDrug Traffic—The Committee on Opium \nand Other Dangerous Drugs concluded, on \nOct. 8, the Extraordinary Session sum\xad\nmoned to consider Italian proposals for, \nfirst, the investigation of the causes of drug \nsmuggling and of penalties and other meas\xad\nures to prevent it, and, second, for limiting \nthe quantities of drugs manufactured to the\namounts required for strictly medical and \nscientific purposes. Drastic action was \nurged not only because the campaign \nagainst smuggling had not been so success\xad\nful as anticipated, but also to provide Gov\xad\nernments with specific suggestions for ap\xad\nplying The Hague and Geneva Conventions. \nThe committee accepted the proposal and \nentrusted its intricate details to a sub-com\xad\nmittee. In addition, advantage was taken \nof the meeting to discuss other phases of \nthe drug problem. Colonel Arthur Woods \nof New York proposed a resolution which \nwas unanimously adopted for either Gov\xad\nernment control or Government ownership \nof drug factories and the rationing of their \noutput to strictly medical and scientific re\xad\nquirements. The German delegate proposed \nthe formation of an international syndicate \nof drug manufacturers. Finally, eighty- \nthree reports of seizures in different parts \nof the world were examined in detail; the \ngeneral adoption of the maritime insurance \nclause was found to be helpful in impeding \nillicit dispatch by sea, and the exchange \nof information between Governments, the \ndevelopment of control and the extension \nof the import and export certificate system \nwere found to be encouraging.\nMandates Commission—Let us turn now \nto the field of mandates, under which the \nadministration of some 20,000,000 people is \nentrusted to the general oversight of the \nLeague. The Permanent Mandates Com\xad\nmission began its twelfth session during the \nmonth, for the first time with a German \nmember. This commission, which meets for \na period of two or three weeks twice a year, \nhas had since its beginning a practically \npermanent personnel of Colonial experts \nfree from the inevitable restrictions of act\xad\nual Government office. Now that Ger\xad\nmany is a member of the League, the Coun\xad\ncil has added a former German Colonial\novper-t tv  tliie com m iceion , w h ich  a t  th ie  cecsion\nexamined, in the presence of duly ac\xad\ncredited representatives of the Mandatory \nPowers, the annual reports of the British \nMandates for Iraq, the Cameroons and \nTogoland, the Belgian Mandate for Ruanda- \nUrundi, the New Zealand Mandate for \nSamoa, where political troubles have re\xad\ncently been reported, and the Japanese \nMandate for the Pacific Isles. Several \nother questions also figured, as the proced\xad\nure concerning petitions, certain specific \npetitions concerning the natives of the \nAdjigo tribe in French Togoland and the \nRehoboth community in Southwest Africa, \nand problems of ex-enemy property and the \nliquor traffic.\n', '412 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 192.7\nHealth Committee Meeting—Toward the \nend of the month began the semi-annual \nHealth Committee meeting with problems \ncovering every part of the globe and many \nkinds of disease. The Malaria Committee, \nwhich has carried out important investiga\xad\ntions in many different countries, and just \nrecently in the Mississippi Basin, met on \nOct. 26 to take note of progress made. Sim\xad\nilarly, a group of expert statisticians from \ndifferent countries came together to dis\xad\ncuss the even wider extension of the Epi\xad\ndemiological Intelligence Service at Geneva, \nparticularly in connection with an Aus\xad\ntralian proposal to enlarge the wireless code \nnow distributing information from the \nEastern Bureau at Singapore to the rest of \nthe world. The full Health Committee, in \naddition to its ordinary work, had before it \nthe very important question of the extension \nof the technical health cooperation with \nLatin America, which had been recommend\xad\ned by the first League Commission sent to \nthat continent and subsequently approved \nby the Assembly and the Council of the \nLeague.\nOther Activities—To conclude the meet\xad\nings, a Committee of Experts on the Educa\xad\ntional Role of Museums met in Paris on Oct. \n28, and the French Foreign Office an\xad\nnounced the constitution at the Bibliothtique\nNationale of a special library on League \naffairs. Many treaties were registered \nduring the month, including ten by Great \nBritain, conciliation conventions between \nDenmark and Belgium and Sweden and \nBelgium and various ratifications, such as \nby Nicaragua and Portugal of the Slavery \nConvention. Finally, a new case was \nbrought before the League when Lithuania \nappealed to the Council under Article XI \nof the Covenant for alleged persecution by \nPoland of Lithuanians in the Vilna region. \nThe subject will be discussed at the Decem\xad\nber session.\nAmerican Participation—As usual, the \nUnited States cooperated in a number of \nLeague activities in October. The Govern\xad\nment was formally represented at the Im\xad\nport and Export Restrictions Conference \nby a delegation headed by Hugh R. Wilson, \nthe American Minister in Switzerland and \nincluding experts from the State, Commerce \nand Treasury Departments. The Shipping \nBoard was represented at the Conference \non Maritime Tonnage Measurements by \nCarogivno Skentelbery; Dr. Taliaferro \nClark of the United States Public Health \nService was present at the Health Commit\xad\ntee meeting, and Colonel Arthur Woods at \nthe Drugs Committee.\nGeneva, October 27.\nTHE UNITED STATES\nNew Candidates for the Presidency\nBy W IL L IA M  M acD O N A L D\nL ately Lecturer on A merican H istory, Y ale University; \nCurrent History A ssociate\nI N spite of President Coolidgc’a an\xad\nnouncement that he did not “ choose” \nto run for the Presidency in 1928, the \ninsistence of some of his supporters that \nhe was the preferred choice of the Repub\xad\nlicans, and that he would probably not \nrefuse to run if he were unanimously re\xad\nnominated, has kept the question of his \ncandidacy before the country and induced \nmany expressions of a desire for a clearer \nstatement of his intentions. One of his \nclosest political friends. Senator Simeon\nD. Fess of Ohio, predicted on Oct. 15, in \nan interview at New York, that the Repub\xad\nlican convention would not be able to choose \namong other candidates on the first ballot, \nthat “ then the delegation from some State\n---and it may bo Ohio— will cuet. ito vote\nsolidly for President Coolidge,”  and that he \n“ will then be renominated virtually by \nacclamation.”  “ President Coolidge knows \nthis,”  Senator Fess continued, “ and he is \nnot going to let the convention nominate \nhim and then decline the nomination. I \nconsider it virtually certain that he will \nbe renominated, unless he should make it \nclear in advance that he would not consent.” \nFor this bold prediction Senator Fess was \ntaken to task by Mr. Coolidge on Oct. 20, \nand was requested not to repeat such state\xad\nments, since they put the President “ in the \nposition of appearing inconsistent.”  Sena\xad\ntor Fess, however, reiterated publicly his \ncontention that Mr. Coolidge could not pro-\n']</pre>
