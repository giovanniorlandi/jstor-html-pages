        <pre>['Spatial Patterns of Soil Organic Carbon in the Contiguous United States\nJeffrey S. Kern*\nABSTRACT\nSpatial patterns and total amounts of soil organic C (SOC) are\nimportant data for studies of soil productivity, soil hydraulic properties,\nand the cycling of C-based greenhouse gases. This study evaluated\nseveral approaches for characterizing SOC to determine their relative\nmerits. The first approach entailed grouping data from a global pedon\nSOC database by type of ecosystem, resulting in a total of 78.0 Pg of\nC (Pg = 1015 g) to 1-m depth for the contiguous USA. In a second\napproach, a pedon database was aggregated using soil taxonomy,\nresulting in a total for the contiguous USA of 80.7 ± 18.6 Pg of C\nwhen the great group SOC was spatially distributed with Major Land\nResource Areas (MLRAs) using the 1982 National Resource Inventory\n(NRI) and the Soil Interpretation Record databases. The third approach\nused pedon and spatial data from a global soil map grouped\nby soil unit that resulted in 84.5 Pg of C for the contiguous USA.\nAlthough the ecosystem and soil taxonomic approaches resulted in\nsimilar totals, the taxonomic approaches are recommended because\nthey gave more realistic results in areas of Histosols, shallow soils,\nand soils with high rock fragment content. The ecosystem approach\ndid not give reh\'able spatial patterns and is only useful for very\nbroad-scale work where precisely georeferenced data are not needed.\nGrouping data by great group provided more information than grouping\nby order or suborder. The approach based on soil taxonomy is\nvery useful because it is based on the NRI statistical framework and\nit allows stratification by other NRI items, such as land use and\nvegetation.\nSOIL ORGANIC MATTER, which is approximately 56%SOC (Nelson and Sommers, 1982), is a major factor\nin plant nutrition (Stevenson, 1982), soil structure, compactability\n(Soane, 1990), and water-holding capacity\n(De Jong et al., 1983). In addition, soil is the largest\nterrestrial pool of C (Post et al., 1990) and must be\nconsidered for evaluating the flux of greenhouse gases\nManTech Environmental Technology Inc., USEPA Environmental Research\nLab., 200 SW 35th St., Corvallis, OR 97333.

The purpose of this\nstudy was to evaluate methods to estimate the spatial\ndistribution and amount of SOC in the contiguous USA\nto assess the relative merits of the methods. This is\nimportant for selecting which method to use for a given\napplication.\nThe SOC content of soil in the USA has been studied\nin many locations; however, there have been few regional\nor U.S. national-scale assessments. Franzmeier et al.\n(1985) characterized the SOC in the north central USA\nbased on a regional soil map, with laboratory data from\npublished reports, theses, and unpublished data from\nsoil survey activities. The map unit composition was\ndetermined from published soil surveys, soil surveys in\nprogress, other inventories, and the expert judgment of\nthe Technical Committee on Soil Survey. The upper 0.2 m\nof mineral soil ranged from 1.0 to 10.7 kg C m~2; the\nupper 1 m ranged from 2.3 to 19.2 kg C m~2.\nParton et al. (1987, 1989) used the CENTURY model\nto analyze controlling factors of SOC accumulation in\nGreat Plains grasslands and modeled the geographic distribution\nof SOC in the upper 20 cm. They concluded\nthat SOC content can be predicted from soil temperature,\nsoil moisture, soil texture, plant lignin content, and N\ninputs and that cool, moist, fine-textured soils have the\ngreatest SOC content. Burke et al. (1989) found that\nhigh SOC content was associated with high precipitation,\nhigh clay content, and low air temperature in grasslands\nAbbreviations: SOC, soil organic C; NRI, National Resource Inventory;\nCDIC, Carbon Dioxide Information Center; NSSL-PD, pedon database\nfrom the National Soil Survey Laboratory; MLRAs, major land resource\nareas; GRID, Global Resource Information Database; SCS, Soil Conservation\nService; UN, United Nations; FAO, Food and Agriculture Organiza-\ntion; UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization;\nCV, coefficient of variation; EROS, Earth Resources Observation\nSatellite.\nPublished March, 1994\n', '440 SOIL SCI.

In southern Great Plains\nMollisols, clay content and, to a lesser degree, annual\nprecipitation were found to be factors of SOC accumulation\n(Nichols, 1984). In frigid and cryic soils of Montana,\ntexture was not significantly correlated with SOC but\ncorrelation was found with elevation and precipitation\n(Sims and Nielsen, 1986). In a literature review, Oades\n(1988) concluded that water regimes and temperature\ncontrolled the turnover of C in soil and the mineralization\nof SOC was retarded by high clay content and base\nsaturation.\nA study of the SOC in a northern hardwood forest\necosystem (consisting predominantly of Spodosols) found\nan average 16 kg C m~2 to a depth of 1 m or less\nincluding O horizons (Huntington et al., 1988). The SOC\nof Spodosols in Florida was found to be somewhat lower\nat 4.9 to 12.6 kg C m"2 to 1-m depth (Stone et al., 1993).\nArmentano and Menges (1986) summarized information\nabout Histosol SOC content, which ranged from 113 kg\nC m~2 to 1-m depth for most of the contiguous USA to\n145 kg C m~2 for the southeastern USA.\nOne widely cited approach (Adams et al., 1990; Prentice\nand Fung, 1990; Jenkinson et al., 1991) for estimat-\ning global SOC is the study by Post et al. (1982), which\nused a large ( — 2700 pedons) database of SOC from\nthroughout the world. The SOC data were grouped by\nHoldridge life zone (Holdridge, 1947) to derive mean\nSOC content from the surface to 1-m depth, and global\nSOC was calculated by multiplying the SOC estimates\nby the land area of the life zone groups. The SOC content\nof wetlands was assumed to be 72.3 kg C m~2, and bogs\nor Histosols were not differentiated. A similar approach\nwas used by Schlesinger (1984) in which data for 117\npedons were aggregated by ecosystem type. Buringh\n(1984) estimated SOC using areal estimates of soil orders\nfrom the USDA-SCS and data from 400 pedons. Bohn\n(1976; 1982) used preliminary data from the UN FAO/\nUNESCO soil map of the world (FAO, 1974-1978) to\nestimate global SOC. Kimble et al. (1990) used the SCS\nNational Soil Survey Laboratory pedon database grouped\nby soil order and global areal estimates of orders to\ncalculate SOC globally for mineral soil. Eswaran et al.\n(1993) estimated global SOC by using the same pedon\ndatabase as Kimble et al. (1990) with some additions\nincluding Histosols, grouping the pedons by suborder,\nand using revised areal estimates of suborders.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS\nEcosystem Complex Approach\nThe first approach closely follows the methods used by\nPost et al. (1982) except that ecosystem complexes (Olson et\nal., 1985), rather than Holdridge life zones (Holdridge, 1947),\nwere used as a geographic base (Fig. 1, Table 1). This approach\nwas used because, as discussed above, the Post et al. (1982)\nstudy had been widely cited and used. The mean SOC per\nunit area was calculated for each ecosystem complex from a\npedon database assuming that each pedon equally represented\nthe ecosystem that it occurred in.

Global pedon data of SOC content\n(Zinke et al., 1984) were obtained from the CDIC. This\ndatabase contained information for 4118 pedons from a variety\nof sources (2392 from North America), and the majority of\nsamples were from the USA and central Eurasia. The data\nwere the basis of the Post et al. (1982) study with pedons\nadded since that study. Many pedons are from work of the\nsenior compiler of the database, and the remainder come from\njournal articles, technical reports, theses, SCS Soil Survey\nInvestigation Reports, and proceedings. Of the 4118 pedons\nwith SOC data, 3256 pedons (1990 from North America)\nhad Holdridge classification and 3700 had Olson classification\n(2373 from North America). No information about soil classification\nis included in the database. No quantification of data\nquality is possible because of the wide variety of data sources.\nThe SOC determinations for the pedon database (Zinke et\nal., 1984) were made using a variety of methods including\nwet combustion and loss on ignition, but the method for each\nsample was not specified in the pedon database. Soil bulk\ndensity was measured using cores for 1800 of the 4118 pedons,\nand the remainder were estimated from regressions based on\ndepth, SOC content, and Olson ecosystem complex. The SOC\ncontent for each pedon was calculated by Zinke et al. (1984)\non a volume basis to 1-m depth by multiplying mass SOC by\nbulk density and correcting for rock fragment content.\nThe geographic distribution of major world ecosystem complexes,\nas they existed in 1980 (Olson et al., 1985), was\nobtained from the CDIC. The spatial resolution of the database\nis 0.5 by 0.5 ° latitude/longitude. The categories of ecosystem\ncomplexes in the spatial database were edited to agree with\nthe categories used in the pedon database. An advantage of\nthe ecosystem complexes described by Olson et al. (1985) is\nthat, unlike the Holdridge system used by Post et al. (1982),\nit differentiates among bogs and other types of wetlands. The\nHoldridge system (Holdridge, 1947) predicts plant formations\nfrom climatic data and, thus, does not predict the extent of\nwetlands, which is largely a function of landscape position.\nA map of the Olson ecosystem complexes of the contiguous\nUSA is presented in Fig. 2. The total SOC was calculated by\nsumming the mean of the pedon SOC content per unit area\naggregated by ecosystem complex times the area occupied.\nWater bodies were assigned zero SOC for all three approaches\nusing the perennial lakes, marshes, and reservoirs shown at\n1:2 million scale by the updated national atlas of the USA\n(U.S. Geological Survey, 1990).\nTaxonomic Approach I: Soil Taxonomy\nThe Soil Taxonomy approach used the order, suborder, and\ngreat group levels of classification (Soil Survey Staff, 1975)\nto aggregate pedon data. A national resource inventory was\nused with a national land resources map to characterize the\nspatial distribution of soil taxonomic units (Fig. 1, Table 1).\nThe SOC content of soil taxonomic units was calculated from\nthe SCS pedon database from the NSSL-PD assuming that\neach pedon equally represented the taxonomic unit. The SCS\nmaintains the NSSL-PD of soil samples analyzed at their laboratories\nin Lincoln, NE, and Riverside, CA, as well as samples\nanalyzed by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in Beltsville,\nMD. Soil organic C was reported as percentage by weight\ndetermined by wet combustion with C^O?"2, and bulk density\nwas determined using the clod method (Soil Survey Staff,\n1984). Data quality was enhanced by uniform methods among\nthe laboratories and standardized sampling procedures, but no\nquantitative statement can be made about the data quality.\nThe database contained 15 789 pedons or sites sampled in\nthe contiguous USA at the time it was obtained, of which 6294\npedons had SOC and measured bulk density data with either\ngreat group classification or a series name that was not a\ntaxadjunct. Of these 6294 pedons, 2258 listed the great group\nclassification. The data for pedons lacking great group identification\nwere merged by soil series with both the 1982 and\ncurrent SCS Soil Interpretation Record database to obtain the\nclassification (SCS, 1983). This data merge added great group\nidentification for 3014 pedons or sites to yield a total of 5272\npedons with potentially useful data.\nBulk density data were necessary to convert SOC measurements\nmade on a weight basis to a volume basis. Only SCS\ndata with accompanying measured bulk density were used\nbecause of the difficulty of estimating bulk density (Manrique\nand Jones, 1991). Bulk density measured at 33 kPa moisture\ncontent was used because it more nearly represents field-moist\nconditions than that measured oven dry. In cases where ovendry\nbulk density was available, but 33 kPa bulk density was\nnot, the oven-dry bulk density was adjusted using the regression\nequation based on NSSL-PD data:\np33 = (POD 0.880)+ 0.046\n(r2 = 0.89, n = 30 035 horizons)\nwhere pas = bulk density at 33 kPa moisture, POD = bulk\ndensity oven dry.\nThe pedon dataset was analyzed by depth increments because\nit was recognized that many pedons were not sampled to 1-m\ndepth for each taxonomic unit. These depth increments were\nadded together to construct an average SOC content to 1 m.\nThe five depth intervals chosen were 0 to 8, 8 to 15, 15 to\n30, 30 to 70, and 70 to 100 cm. Soil organic C by volume\nwas calculated by multiplying SOC by weight, bulk density,\nand soil depth.\nThe data were grouped by soil order, soil suborder, and great\ngroup for separate data analyses. There were not a sufficient\nnumber of samples to go to a more detailed category than\n', '442 SOIL SCI. SOC. AM.

Grouping the pedons by soil order resulted in\n3541, 3682, 3452, 2822, and 2505 pedons being used for\nthe five depth increments, respectively. When pedons were\ngrouped by suborder, the usable number of pedons was 3541,\n3681, 3449, 2819, and 2504. The results of the great group\nanalysis were screened manually to eliminate outliers and bring\nthe CV to 80 or below. The 80% CV level was chosen because\npreliminary data analyses showed only a small number of\nextreme values exceeded this level. The number of samples\nused for the increments in the final analysis by great group\nwere 3478, 3625, 3401, 2784, and 2465. There were fewer\nsamples in the first depth increment than the second increment\nbecause of the difficulty of obtaining bulk density measurements\nfrom horizons near the soil surface.\nThe SOC content by great group was then geographically\ndistributed using MLRAs as a map base, which are areas with\nsimilar patterns of soils, climate, water resources, and land\nuse that was published at a map scale of 1:7.5 million (SCS,\n1981). The areal extent of great groups in each MLRA was\ndetermined using the 1982 NRI and the total area of each\nMLRA. The MLRA map and 1982 NRI are known collectively\nas the National Soil Geographic Database (Reybold and TeSelle,\n1989; Bliss, 1990). The dominant subgroups determined\nfrom the 1982 NRI and the MLRA map are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe 1982 NRI is the most extensive inventory made in the\nUSA of soil, water, and related resources of nonfederally\nowned land. The SCS coordinated data collection from 352 786\nprimary sampling units, with three or less sampling points\neach, for the 1982 NRI. The data collected included soil\ncharacteristics, soil interpretations, land cover, land use, erosion,\nland management, conservation needs, and potential for\nconversion to farmland. There was a total of 841 860 sampling\npoints in all counties of the USA (except for Alaska) and U.S.\npossessions in the Caribbean. Sites were selected to represent\nthe MLRAs with a confidence limit of plus or minus one\nstandard deviation for attributes that comprise 10% of the\nMLRA (SCS, 1987). Thus, if corn (Zea mays L.) is produced\non 10% of the area of a MLRA, then the theoretical confidence\nlimit is plus or minus one standard deviation. The analyses\nfor this study had a higher confidence limit because every\n(nonwater and nonurban) point of the database has soil as an\nattribute. The 1982 NRI is of limited use for characterizing\nwetlands because it does not contain information for millions\nof acres that the NRI classified as water, but that might be\n', 'KERN: SOIL ORGANIC CARBON SPATIAL PATTERNS 443\nE3\xa0 A q u a l f s\xa0B\xa0X e r p l f s\nS\xa0Boro l f s\xa0 HD\xa0 Arg ids\nSUdolfs\xa0 nmOrthids\nSUsta l fs\xa0 ^Fluvents\nOr then ts\nPsamments\nHemlsts\nSapr i s t s\nA q u e p t s\nOchrep ts\nUmbrepts\nAquol ls\nBo ro l l s\nUdolls\nUsto l ls\nXero l l s\nAquods\nOrthods\nAquu l t s\nUdul ts\nU s t e r t s\nFig. 3.

In these analyses, the nonfederal land\nwithin the MLRAs is assumed to represent the federal land\nas well. The expansion factor for each point indicates the area\nthat the point represents.\nEvery point in the NRI has a number that links it to the\nSoil Interpretation Record that includes taxonomic information\nand estimated soil properties based on the expert judgment of\npersonnel involved in soil survey work. Organic matter contents\nfrom the Soil Interpretation Record are of limited use\nfor estimating SOC because they are estimates that may not\nbe based on laboratory data, they are expressed as a range,\nand only organic matter data for surface horizons were recorded.\nThe soil properties for this project obtained from\nthe Soil Interpretation Record are depth to bedrock and the\ntaxonomic classification. A special version of the Soil Interpretation\nRecord from 1982 has been developed by the SCS for\nuse with the 1982 NRI data.\nSome classes in soil taxonomy have changed since 1982,\nand the 1982 version of soil taxonomy is used in this study\nfor the NRI points. For example, many soils that formerly\nwere in the Andept suborder of Inceptisols are now considered\nAndisols. There have also been changes in the Oxisol classifications,\nbecause currently the suborder Orthox is not defined\nand previously there were no Udox (Soil Survey Staff, 1975,\n1990).\nGreat groups identified in the 1982 NRI that were not\nrepresented in the NSSL-PD were assigned the SOC content\nof similar great groups with data. Miscellaneous land areas,\nconsidered nonsoil, were identified in the 1982 NRI. Miscellaneous\nland areas that were assigned SOC contents of 0.2 kg\nC m~2 to the 1-m depth were alluvial land, badlands, gullied\nland, gypsum land, lava flows, playas, rubble land, salt flats,\nand scoria. The remaining miscellaneous areas were assigned\na SOC value of 0.\nAn approximation of minimum and maximum SOC was\ncalculated by adding or subtracting one-half of the increment\nSOC standard deviation from the mean SOC before geographical\ndistribution. The reasoning was that estimates based on\nthe 1982 NRI have a theoretical confidence limit of plus or\nminus one standard deviation, thus estimates based on the type\nof soil that has a very large sample size should have a somewhat\nmore narrow confidence limit. The standard deviation of the\nSOC content for each combination of great group and increment\ncould not be calculated because in some cases there was only\none sample. The average CV (standard deviation/mean X 100)\nfor each increment was also calculated by soil order. All\n', '444 SOIL SCI. SOC. AM.

Water bodies\nwere assigned zero SOC using the perennial lakes, marshes,\nand reservoirs shown at 1:2 million scale by the updated\nnational atlas of the USA (U.S. Geological Survey, 1990).\nThe SOC for each MLRA was calculated by\nE SOCiayer x expansion factor\nE expansion factor\nTaxonomic Approach II: Soil Map of the World\n[2]\nThe FAO/UNESCO soil map of the world was chosen as\na geographic layer because consistent data about the spatial\ndistribution was needed, not only for the USA but also globally.\nThe soil map of the world is currently the most comprehensive\nglobal-scale soil map available (Sombroek, 1989). The soil\nmap of the world was based on soil information available in\nthe 1960s to 1970s and is primarily a compilation of available\nnational soil maps with additional field work by FAO staff.\nThe soil map of the world, published at a scale of 1:5 million,\nwas compiled from approximately 600 soil maps of different\nscales and legends with 11000 other maps such as physiography,\nvegetation, climate, geology, and land use system, which\nconstituted a system for correlating various taxonomic systems\n(FAO, 1974-1978). The texts that accompany the map sheets\ncontain information about map unit composition and general\nproperties of the soil units.\nThe example pedons with laboratory data that accompany\nall volumes of the soil map of the world (255 pedons) were\nused to make SOC calculations grouped by soil unit (Fig. 1,\nTable 1). These pedons were presented as typical profiles, but\nit was cautioned that "one profile will not show the range of\nsoil characteristics and climatic conditions within such broad\nunits" (FAO, 1974-1978). Thus, it was assumed that these\npedons represented broad modal soil characteristics. Missing\nmineral bulk density values were estimated, based on texture,\nfrom guidelines from the SCS (SCS, 1983).

Soil units with missing SOC were assigned\nSOC from similar soil units in 52 cases. Lithosols were assigned\ndepths of 10 cm, soil with bedrock within 100-cm depth were\nassigned 85 cm, and stony soils were assumed to contain 40%\nrock.\nThe soil geography of the soil map of the world for the\nUSA (Fig. 4) was based on the SCS general soil map (FAO,\n1974-1978) at 1:7.5 million map scale that was apparently\nalso a source of soil data for the MLRA map (SCS, 1981).\nThe soil map of the world at 1:5 million map scale has greater\ndetail than the MLRA map and also has soil phases indicated\nas map overprints. The map has been digitized and is available\nfrom the Global Resource Information Database program of\nthe United Nations Environment Programme. The digital soil\nmap of the world data used in this study were obtained from\nthe EROS Data Center of the U.S. Geological Survey. The\nlegend of the soil map of the world has >5000 map units,\nwhich consist of soil units or associations of soil units. Some\nmap units are composed of 100% of the dominant soil; however,\nmore commonly at this scale of mapping, there are\nassociated soils and inclusions. Associated soils cover at least\n20% of the map unit area, and inclusions cover <20%. Phases\nof map units were used to indicate indurated layers, hard\nbedrock at shallow depth, stoniness, salinity, or alkalinity\n(FAO, 1974-1978). The FAO estimated the composition of\neach map unit using the methodology developed in the Agroecological\nZones Project (FAO, 1978). Water bodies were as-\nsigned zero SOC using the perennial lakes, marshes, and\nreservoirs shown at 1:2 million scale by the updated national\natlas of the USA (U.S. Geological Survey, 1990).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSoil Organic Carbon by Ecosystem Complexes\nThe results of the average SOC content of the ecosystem\ncomplexes that occur in North America are listed\nin Table 2, and the spatial distribution for the contiguous\nUSA is shown in Fig. 5. One sample for bogs had 349.4\nkg C m~2, which is much higher than any pedon, and\nwas removed from the database. Bogs and bog woods\nhad the greatest SOC content at 113.2 kg C m~2 and\ntropical thorn-succulent woods had the least at 2.1 kg\nC m"2. Forests, ranging from 10.9 to 15.9 kg C irr2,\ntended to have greater SOC than grasslands, with 8.4\nto 12.4 kg C nr2. The variability of the SOC content\nwithin the ecosystem complexes, as indicated by the\nCV was large (Table 2). Marshes, swamps, and littoral\nregions had the greatest variability (136% CV) with a\nrange of 5.3 to 124.0 kg C m~2. Cool conifer forests\nhad a range of 0.4 to 349.4 kg C m~2. The total SOC\nfor the contiguous USA based on this approach was 78.0\nPg. The CV of many ecosystem complexes was >80,\nand some CV values were MOO, which indicates that\n', '446 SOIL SCI. SOC. AM.

The ranking of the SOC\ncontent of the soil orders was Aridisols < Entisols ~\nUltisols = Alfisols < Vertisols < Oxisols < Inceptisols <\nMollisols < Spodosols « Histosols. Histosols contained\nnearly six times the SOC of Spodosols, which is the\nnext lowest order. Greater SOC density heterogeneity\nwas observed below 30-cm depth for most soils, as\nevidenced by higher CVs, and is due, in part, to smaller\nsample sizes. Soil organic C content decreased with\ndepth for all soil orders.\nTable 4 lists the SOC results for the suborders represented\nin the database. Alfisol suborders had the SOC\ncontent trend of Udalfs « Ustalfs < Xeralfs < Aqualfs\n< Boralfs. The Argid and Orthid suborders of Aridisols\nhad nearly equal SOC content. The suborders of Entisols\nhad considerable variation, with a low of 4.9 kg C m~2\nfor the sandy Psamments and 10.5 kg C m~2 for wet\nAquents. Arents had consistently high SOC density\nthroughout the profile, resulting in high total SOC content\n(but there was only one pedon represented). Saprists\nwere the only suborder of Histosols represented in the\ndata, with SOC of 86.9 kg C nr2. The Inceptisol suborders\nshowed the trend Ochrepts < Tropepts < Aquepts\n~ Andepts. Aquepts and Andepts had a great deal of\nvariability in SOC density for the lower horizons. All\nsuborders of Mollisols had SOC content >10 kg C m~2\nwith the trend Ustolls < Xerolls < Borolls < Albolls <\nUdolls < Aquolls. Oxisols were not well represented\nin the database because they are not extensive in the\ncontiguous USA. Oxisols were not identified in the 1982\nNRI for the contiguous USA but are included here for\ncomparison. The trend for Oxisol suborders were Orthoxs\n< Torroxs < Ustoxs < Udoxs. Spodosol suborders\ndisplayed a different trend than many others because the\naquic suborder had less SOC than the orthic. The Aquods\nhad relatively high SOC density in the upper solum, but\nthe amount decreased more sharply with depth than in\nthe Orthods. The majority of the Ultisol samples were\nUdults, which had considerably lower SOC content than\nthe other suborders. The trend for Ultisol suborders was\nUdults < Aquults < Ustults « Xerults < Humults. The\ntrend for Vertisol suborders was Xererts < Uderts <\nTorrerts < Usterts.\nTable 4.

In a few cases, the depth\nincrement SOC density was estimated based on the values\nof surrounding increments, hi which case zero was entered\nfor a number of samples. When the most central\ntype of each Alfisol suborder was chosen, the trend was\nHaploxeralfs < Haplustalfs < Hapludalfs < Ochraqualfs\n< Eutroboralfs. Alfisol great groups with indications of\nan arid environment, such as Natraqualfs, Natrudalfs,\nNatrixeralfs, and Durixeralfs, had relatively low total\nSOC content. The range of total SOC content for most\nAridisol great groups (Table 5) was 5.2 (Durorthids and\nHaplargids) to 6.5 kg C m~2 (Camborthids). Paleorthid\nand Gypsiorthid SOC contents were particularly low, at\n3.2 and 4.4 kg C nr2.\nThe SOC content of Entisols is listed hi Table 5.\nHydraquents, clayey soils of tidal marshes (Soil Survey\nStaff, 1975), had the greatest SOC of all the Entisol\ngreat groups. The other aquic Entisols (Haplaquents,\nCryaquents, and Fluvaquents) had moderately high SOC\ncontent. The arid Entisol great groups (Torrifluvents,\nTorriorthents, and Torripsamments) had lower SOC content\nthan did great groups with the same suborders. The\ncold great groups, Cryofluvents and Cryorthents, had\nsomewhat low SOC content, but the SOC was relatively\nhigh for the cold, coarse-textured Cryopsamments. Great\ngroups with xeric moisture regimes (Xerofluvents, Xerorthents,\nand Xeropsamments) had moderately high SOC\ncontents. Great groups with ustic moisture regimes (Ustorthents\nand Ustipsamments) had relatively low SOC\nexcept for the alluvial Ustifluvents. Udorthents, with\nudic moisture regimes had high SOC content, whereas\nother udic great groups (Udifluvents and Udipsamments)\nhad moderate SOC compared with the same suborders.\nThere were only 18 samples to characterize Histosol\ngreat groups (Table 5), and they were all in the same\nsuborder. Borosaprists had lower SOC content than Medisaprists,\nalthough they had similar SOC densities hi the\nupper 30 cm. Inceptisols showed a wide variation in\nSOC content by great group (Table 5). Inceptisol great\ngroups influenced by volcanic parent material (Dystrandepts,\nHydrandepts, Eutrandepts, and Cryandepts) had\nhigh SOC content, except for the coarse-textured Vitrandepts.\nAndaquepts, which have both andic and hydric\nproperties, had particularly high SOC content. The saltaffected\nHalaquepts had the lowest SOC content of the\naquic great groups. Of the Tropepts, the tropical Inceptisols,\nonly the Humitropepts great group had exceptionally\nhigh SOC content. Great groups with umbric epipedons,\nwhich by definition have organic matter accumulations,\n', '450 SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J., VOL. 58, MARCH-APRIL 1994\nhad high SOC content (Haplumbrepts and Xerumbrepts)\nexcept for soils with fragipans and cryic temperatures\n(Fragiumbrepts and Cryumbrepts).\nThe haplic great groups of Mollisols (Table 5) showed\nthe following trend: Haplustolls « Haploxerolls <\nHaploborolls < Hapludolls < Haplaquolls. Mollisol great\ngroups with argillic horizon development had the following\ntrend: Argiustolls < Argixerolls < Argiborolls <\nArgiudolls « Argialbolls < Argiaquolls. Sodiumaffected\nMollisols ranked Natrixerolls < Natraquolls <\nNatrialbolls < Natriborolls < Natrustolls. The trend for\ncalcareous Mollisols was Calciustolls < Calciborolls <\nCalciaquolls < Calcixerolls.\nThe SOC contents of the Oxisol great group are presented\nin Table 5. The greatest SOC content was for\nHapludoxs, but the lowest SOC content was for Haplorthox,\nwhich has nearly the same definition in the older\nversion of Soil Taxonomy. The SOC trend for the Oxisols\nwas Acrorthoxs < Haplorthoxs < Acrudoxs < Torroxs\n< Eutrustoxs < Kandiudoxs < Hapludoxs.\nThe Spodosol great groups (Table 5) all had relatively\nhigh SOC content with the exception of the Haplaquods.\nThe Cryorthods had considerably greater SOC than did\nthe other great groups. The Spodosols, in general, did\nnot have a marked decrease in SOC density hi the 30to\n70-cm increment, as was seen in many other great\ngroups, apparently because of illuviation of organic\nmatter.\nThe great groups of Ultisols had quite a bit of variation\nin SOC content (Table 5). The poorly drained Umbraquults,\nwhich by definition have organic matter accu-\nmulations, had nearly three times the SOC content of\nother great groups. The heavily weathered great groups\n(Paleudults, Kandhaphludults, and Kandiudults) all had\nlow SOC contents of 5.5 kg C m~2 or less. The great\ngroups that are defined by high SOC accumulations\nshowed the trend Palehumults > Haplohumults > Tropohumults.\nHaplustults and Haploxerults had nearly the\nsame SOC content as the humult great groups.\nThe SOC of the great groups of Vertisols is listed in\nTable 5. Chromusterts and Pellusterts, with ustic moisture\nregimes, had the highest SOC content. The Torrerts\nfrom arid climates, as well as the Chromuderts and\nPelluderts from humid regions, had similar SOC content.\nFor the Xererts, Pelloxererts had nearly as much SOC\ncontent as Usterts but the Chromoxererts had half.\nThe CV of the SOC density estimates by soil order was\nanalyzed to assign theoretical SOC standard deviations to\nincrements with only one sample. The CVs tended to\nbe <50 with an average of 45, 42, 46, 46, and 51 for\ndepth intervals of 0 to 8, 8 to 15, 15 to 30, 30 to 70,\nand 70 to 100 cm, respectively.\nThere was too much variation hi the kinds of soils\ngrouped into soil orders, with the possible exception of\nHistosols, to make them very useful for predicting SOC\ncontent. Grouping data by suborders provided a better\nestimate than by orders because suborders give more\nindications of climate, drainage, and coarse textures,\nwhich are important factors for SOC accumulation. Soil\norganic C by great group provided even more detail\nabout soil-forming factors that affect SOC accumulation.\nGreat group classification provided only a limited indication\nof soil texture (very sandy and some very clayey\nsoils) and temperature, which is included in family level\nclassification. There was an insufficient number of pedons\nto do these analyses at a family level of classification.\nThe tendency for soils from arid climates to have low\nSOC content (<6 kg C m~2) is illustrated by the results\nfor great groups such as Torripsamments, Gypsiorthids,\nHaplargids, Naturargids, Torriorthents, and Paleargids.\nCoarse-textured soils had low SOC as shown by the\nTorrispamments, Ustipsamments, Quartzipsamments,\nXeropsamments, and Udipsamments. Some highly\nweathered soils have low SOC contents, such as the\nkandic great groups with their low-activity clays.\nThe influence of the soil moisture regimes varied from\norder to order. The general tendency for wet (aquic)\nand cold (boric and cryic) groupings to have greater\nSOC was fairly consistent. Aquods, an exception, did\nnot have high amounts of SOC in their subsoils, which\nmay be a function of the impedance to illuviation of\nhumus by the poor drainage. Within similar great groups,\nudic groups tended to be greater than xeric and ustic\nbut the relation of these two groups varied. In haplic\nAlfisols, xeric was less than ustic, but ustic was less\nthan xeric hi haplic, argic, and calcic great groups of\nMollisols. Great groups with the formative elements\numbr, hum, and umb tend to have higher SOC than other\nsimilar great groups. Soils with volcanic material tend\nto have high SOC content.\nThe Histosols stand out because they are, by definition,\ncomposed almost entirely of organic material. There are\nnot enough data for Histosol great groups to indicate\nwith certainty if Borosaprists consistently have more\nSOC than Medisaprists.\nSpatially distributing the great group SOC for the\ncontiguous USA results in a mean of 80.7 Pg of C; the\nspatial patterns are shown hi Fig. 6. The maximum\nSOC, as calculated by adding one-half of the standard\ndeviations of the increment SOC densities, is 99.3 Pg,\nand the minimum, by subtracting one-half of the SOC\nstandard deviations, resulted hi 62.1 Pg of C. The spatial\npatterns of SOC as characterized by the Soil Taxonomy\napproach (Fig. 6) showed the greatest SOC content hi\nareas of extensive Histosols and poorly drained soils\nsuch as in the northern Midwest, coastal Southeast and\nLouisiana, and southern Florida. The northcentral Midwest,\nwith its extensive Mollisols, had relatively high\nSOC content. The northern Northeast had high SOC\ncontent because of the extensive distribution of Spodosols.\nThe western Pacific Northwest also had relatively\nhigh amounts of SOC, probably because of high amounts\nof precipitation and cool temperatures.\nSoil Organic Carbon from the Soil Map of the World\nThe SOC content of the soil units from the soil map\nof the world are presented hi Table 6. The groupings\nwith the lowest amount of SOC were the arid Xerosols\nand Yermosols. The Yermosols, which are the most arid\ngrouping, were extremely low hi SOC content, but there\nwas only one representative pedon of each.

Acrisols tended to have low\nSOC content. The Andosols, with the exception of Vitric,\nhad high SOC content. The coarse-textured Arenosols\nall tended to have low SOC content. The soils with\ndark surface horizons (Chernozems, Kastanozems, and\nPhaoezems) tended to have high SOC content. The poorly\ndrained Gleysols had moderate to high SOC content.\nSpatial application of the soil unit SOC contents resulted\nin 84.5 Pg of C for the contiguous USA (Fig. 7).\nThe soil units with the lowest SOC content were the\narid Yermosols, which were much less than comparable\nAridisol great groups. The sandy Arenosols had low\nSOC content, which is comparable to similar psamment\ngreat groups. Soil units from dry climates (Xerosols,\nSolonchaks, and Solonetz) tended to have low SOC content\nexcept for soil units with mollic prefixes. Chromic\nVertisols had low SOC content, which is similar to the\ngreat group Chromoxerts, but other chromic Vertisol\ngreat groups (Chromouderts and Chromousterts) had\ntwice the SOC content of the soil map of the world\nvalues.\nThe Luvisol SOC contents were comparable to Alfisol\ngreat groups with the exception of the much higher\nAlbic Luvisols. The great group Eutroboralf is similar\nin morphology to Albic Luvisols but had 8.7 kg C m"2\ncompared with 21.7 kg C m""2 for Albic Luvisols. There\nwas not much difference among Kastanozems and\nPhaoezems (12-15 kg C m~2), which were comparable\nto the similar great groups of Ustoll and Udoll suborders.\nThe Chernozem SOC content was slightly higher than\ncomparable Boroll great groups. The Podzols had a\nsimilar range to the Spodosol great groups with the\nexception of the Gleyic Podzol, which was relatively\nhigh.\nThe spatial distribution of SOC for the contiguous\nUSA from the soil map of the world data (Fig. 7) was\nsimilar to the mean Soil Taxonomy approach (Fig. 6)\nexcept that the soil map of the world data indicated\n', '452 SOIL SCI.

The SOC content based on\necosystems of the contiguous USA (78.0 Pg of C) was\nwithin one-half of the SOC standard deviation. Thus, at\nthat scale, this method was useful, but the spatial patterns\nmight not be useful for more detailed studies. The ecosystem\napproach might be useful for global studies where\nit is not combined with other georeferenced data and\nwhere only a large region total is needed. The unreliability\nof the spatial patterns of SOC make this approach\nof limited use hi studies where georeferenced data, such\nas climate or land use, are used. The pedon data on\nwhich the ecosystem complex approach is based contain\nonly one value for SOC from 0- to 1-m depth, which\nlimits its use when some other depth increment is needed.\nThe pedon data for the other approaches can be subset\nat any depth to be used for applications such as SOC\nloss from erosion (Kern, 1992) or changes in surface\nSOC from tillage (Kern and Johnson, 1993).\nSoil classification is a much better framework for\ndata aggregation than is ecosystem complex. The soil\nclassification systems do not have narrow limits of SOC\nin their criteria, but soils with similar classification often\nhave similar factors that affect SOC accumulation. Soil\norders and suborders were not very effective for aggregating\npedon data. Great groups were a better framework\nand were a good compromise for level of detail because\naggregation at a more specific level, such as subgroup or\nfamily, would require extremely large pedon databases.\nThe SOC content of the contiguous USA using the\nsoil map of the world (84.5 Pg of C) came very close to\nthe mean SOC content as calculated by the Soil Taxonomy\napproach (80.7 Pg of C). This similarity may be due,\nin part, to the common origin of the map data. The\ntwo approaches yielded very similar SOC per unit area\nestimates for similar types of soils. The spatial detail of\nthe soil map of the world was slightly greater than that\nof the Soil Taxonomy approach (MLRAs), which is an\nadvantage for some applications. An advantage of the\nSoil Taxonomy approach is that it is possible to estimate\nupper and lower limits using assumptions about the NRI\ndata. The Soil Taxonomy approach may be less reliable\n", '454 SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J., VOL. 58, MARCH-APRIL 1994\nin areas of extensive federal land because the 1982 NRI\nexcludes federal land. This limitation may be minimized\nif nonfederal land studied in the MLRAs was similar to\nfederal land. The Soil Taxonomy approach has many\nadvantages because of additional data contained in the\n1982 NRI, such as land use. This is illustrated by a\nstudy of the impact of conservation tillage on SOC (Kern\nand Johnson, 1993) where cropland SOC was estimated\nby using points from the NRI that were cropland and\noverlaying these points with a map of the areal extent\nof planted cropland. The 1982 NRI provides a greater\nnumber of map unit components than does the soil map\nof the world, which is very useful for applications where\nthe maximum or minimum values, rather than mean\nvalues, are critical. The SCS data approach provides\na wealth of auxiliary information, such as land use,\nvegetation, and erosion from the 1982 NRI, which can\nbe used for data aggregation.\nImproved statistical confidence will require larger\nnumbers of sampled pedons to be included in the analyses.\nIt would l>e very useful if existing databases, such\nas the Zinke et al. (1984) dataset, could be updated by\nincluding the soil classification for samples that have\nalready been analyzed for SOC content. There are a\nconsiderable number of pedons or sites in the NSSL-PD\nwith missing series classification. The land use of pedons\nsampled should also be identified. There is not a lack\nof SOC measurements by weight, but there is a shortage\nof accompany big bulk density measurements. Measurement\nof bulk density in Histosols can be problematic,\nbut it makes an enormous difference in the SOC estimates\nby volume.\nBetter information about how the sampled pedons represent\nthe taxonomic unit used to aggregate the data is\nneeded. In this study, each pedon was assumed to equally\nrepresent ecosystem complexes or taxonomic units, but\nthis was probably not the case. Information about whether\nthe pedon is typical or atypical would enable different\nweighting. Similarly, better locational data would permit\nfurther aggregating data by river basin, county, or other\nsubarea.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was aided by the generous help of many\nagencies.
