The social relevance of a group becomes legally relevant, if the group is treated \nas real and acquires an identity of its own. Identity is at the heart of every genocide and crucial to \nexplain the crime.1 Individuals are targeted on the basis of their actual or perceived association to a \ngroup, even if the perpetrator’s perception of the victim group is “wildly inaccurate”.2\nThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) defines the crime of genocide as \nfollows: “‘genocide’ means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or \nin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such…”.3 This article will primarily focus \non the racial group, yet in the context of the overall group membership of the victims of genocide. \nWhere it appears appropriate and legally correct, the general analysis of the group membership \nwill be applied to the racial group.\nIn the crime of genocide, the perpetrator selects and targets his victims because of their \nmembership to a certain group. In order to convict a perpetrator for the crime of genocide, \nthe courts have to prove that the victims belonged to one of the four protected groups. David \nNersessian correctly recognizes that “[i]f an individual lacks membership in a protected group, \ngenocide cannot occur with respect to that victim”.4 The case studies of Cambodia and Rwanda \nwill subsequently demonstrate the difficulties of determining the victims of genocide as members \nof a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. International criminal tribunals have largely tried to \navoid defining group membership and in particular race. While sociology and anthropology, together \nwith other disciplines, successfully adopted a contemporary approach to race as the perception of \ndifferentness,5 international criminal law is showing great discomfort with collective identities.\n1 David Moshman, “Us and Them: Identity and Genocide,” Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research 7, No. 2 \n(2007), 116.\n2 Moshman, “Us and Them”, 116.\n3 Art. 6 of the Rome Statute of the ICC, UN Doc.

Such subjective approaches are commonplace \nin socio-anthropology for the definition of group membership in general and for the definition \nof a racial group in particular.7 The application of this approach by the international judiciary is, \nhowever, a recent development. One of its greatest benefits is the avoidance of objective parameters \nsuch as skin color, thus finally breaking with contentious means of objectively defining race.8 The \nassessment and clarification of the subjective approach, with help of the theory of imagined identity, \nis the objective of this paper. It will furthermore show how the theory of imagined identities applies \nto cases of genocide.\nNonetheless, a subjective approach to defining the racial victim group has to be brought into \nconformity with the principle of legality, particularly its elements of specificity and foreseeability, \nwhich will be examined in the next section. Following the review of the principle of legality, \nthis article will look at how legal scholarship deals with race. Thereafter the theory of imagined \nidentities is presented, as well as its application to genocidal cases. The jurisprudence by the ad \nhoc international criminal tribunals, namely the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia (ICTY)9 and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR),10 on the victim \ngroups of genocide is then analyzed. The definition of genocide by the Commission of Inquiry \non Violations of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law in Darfur (Darfur \nCommission) is also scrutinized.11 The Darfur Commission made a major contribution to defining \nthe group membership in the crime of genocide by applying the theory of imagined identities. As \nsuch, it opened up for the application of this theory to future cases before the ICC, which still is in \nits infancy with regard to prosecutions of the crime of genocide.12\nThe Implications of the Principle of Legality\nThe principle of legality requires that an accused is not held guilty unless his act or omission \nconstituted a crime under law at the time and location of its commission.13 The principle is \nconstrued to prevent the punishment for acts, which were reasonably believed not to be criminal \nwhen committed.14\nAlready in 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal observed in its judgment against the major war \ncriminals that a fundamental principle of all law, international as well as domestic, was that there \nand Nationalism,” Annual Review of Sociology 35 (2009), 21–42.

Under the heading “General Principles of Criminal Law”, the Statute specifically lists nullum \ncrimen sine lege (Art. 22), nulla poena sine lege (Art. 23), according to which no punishment may be \nimposed except as provided by law and, lastly, nulla poena sine praevia lege (Art. 24) or, no penalty \nwithout previous law.19 The Rome Statute makes clear that the principle of legality consists of \nseveral elements, namely the strict construction of the definition of a crime, the prohibition of \nextension by analogy and in dubio pro reo, whereby in case of ambiguity the definition shall be \ninterpreted in favor of the person under investigation or prosecution (Art. 22 (2)).\nThe principle of legality restricts any excessive interpretative activity in that the judges must \nrespect its most important corollaries: the principle of strict construction and in dubio pro reo (when \nin doubt, for the accused).20 Due to the principle of strict construction, the judges may not adopt \na method of interpretation that unduly broadens the definition of the crimes. In other words: \nthe respective provision may only be applied to conduct that the drafters expressly intended to \ncriminalize.21\nThe principle of legality is twofold: first, a criminal law provision needs to be sufficiently clear \nand specific for the perpetrator to foresee that he could become criminally liable, thereby giving \nhim the opportunity to adjust his behavior in order to avoid sanctions.22 Secondly, the law has to \nbe unambiguous and accessible for judges to render uniform and coherent judgments, without \nexpansively interpreting the respective provisions. The latter also serves the purpose of protecting \ncitizens from arbitrary judicial actions.23 There remain therefore two opposites: on the one hand, the \nprinciple of legality imposes interpretative boundaries. On the other hand, a broad interpretation \nmay protect more victims. Thus, while the judges may interpret and apply the law on the crime of \ngenocide, they are not permitted to create new law by means of expansive judicial interpretation. \nThe interpretation of race is therefore limited to what the drafters intended to criminalize and \ncannot go beyond what is understood to be a racial group.\nThe theory of imagined identities challenges the principle of legality in several ways. The \nnarrow definition of the crime of genocide will inevitably be broadened if the group membership is \n15 Nuremberg International Military Tribunal (IMT), Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the IMT, Judgment \n(November 14, 1945 - October 1, 1946), Official Text in the English Language (1947), 219.\n16 Kenneth Gallant, The Principle of Legality in International and Comparative Criminal Law (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2009), 3.

From initially protecting four exclusive groups, the ambit \nof the provision would be expanded to cover any victim perceived as belonging to one of the four \ngroups. Richard Ashby Wilson points to the challenges that a perception-based approach might \nentail: “If a group’s existence is not a fact but a changeable chimera dependent on a subjective \nstate of mind, then the whole edifice of the [ICTR]’s mandate to prosecute the crime of genocide \nis potentially undermined”.24 By basing a legal definition on the perpetrator’s perception, the \nprinciple of strict construction and the related element of specificity are challenged. The principle \nof foreseeability is also affected, since the application of the criminal provision cannot possibly be \nforeseen if its content is fully dependent on a person’s perception or imagination. This article will \ndemonstrate that the theory of imagined identities nevertheless is compatible with the principle \nof legality, despite pushing its boundaries. It is an innovative, yet legitimate legal tool for the \nidentification of the victim groups in the crime of genocide. The next section will give an insight \ninto the historical development of race and its protection by the Convention on the Prevention \nand Punishment of Genocide (Genocide Convention),25 before further discussing the theory of \nimagined identities.\nThe Authoritative Source: The Genocide Convention\nThe proponents of different social studies often employ the term genocide more broadly as the \nintended mass killing of a group of people.26 International criminal law - bound by the principle of \nstrict legality - limits its protection against genocide to the racial, ethnical, religious and national \ngroups. In order to convict a perpetrator of the crime of genocide, all the legal elements of the crime \nhave to be fulfilled, including the protected victim group.27 The narrow definition of genocide and \nthe four protected groups is definitive for legal purposes, although it is seen as seriously flawed by \nnon-legal genocide scholars.28\nDuring the drafting of the Rome Statute of the ICC, the state delegates made clear that the \n1948 Genocide Convention contained a generally acceptable definition of the crime of genocide \nthat could and should be used in the Statute.29 Indeed, genocide was the only crime that received a \nquick and unanimous consensus without any further discussion on what defines a racial group.30 \nNot only Art. 6 Rome Statute, but also the respective provisions in the ICTY and ICTR Statute are \nverbatim to Art. II Genocide Convention. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has furthermore \ndeclared that Art. II Genocide Convention is customary international law and jus cogens,31 making \n24 Richard Ashby Wilson, “Crimes against Humanity and the Conundrum of Race and Ethnicity at the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda,” in In the Name of Humanity: The Government of Threat and Care, ed.

See also David Lisson, “Defining ‘National Group’ in the Genocide Convention: a Case Study of Timor-Leste,” \nStanford Law Review (2008), 1463, providing a brief summary of different approaches to the definition of genocide that \nhave no legal force.\n27 There are diverging views as to whether the victim group is an objective or subjective element. Some include the victim \ngroups into the mens rea, while others see the victim group as an element of the actus reus. The wording of Art. II \nGenocide Convention suggests the latter, since the element of a ‘group’ is part of each genocidal act. For example, Art. \nII(a) reads: “Killing members of the group”. The group is therefore part of the objective elements of the crime.

The following discussion of the crime of \ngenocide and the protected victim groups is therefore based on Art. II Genocide Convention as the \nauthoritative definition.\nThe travaux préparatoires to the Genocide Convention reveal that the four protected groups - the \nnational, ethnical, racial and religious group - were intended to be an exhaustive list. The drafters \nconsidered them to be cohesive, stable and permanent.32 Therefore these groups merited more \nprotection than loose groups to which membership could be easily gained or renounced, such as \npolitical groups.33 While there undoubtedly were political reasons to exclude political groups from \nthe protection of the Genocide Convention, the International Law Commission in 1996 restated that \nthe exclusion occurred because “this type of group was not considered to be sufficiently stable”.34\nHistorical research shows that the idea of race always carried more meanings than mere \nphysical differences. In fact, physical variations in the human species have no meaning except \nthe social values that humans apply to them.35 David Davis concludes that “[l]ike serfdom, social \ncastes, and royal or noble ‘blood’, concepts of race influence perception, including self-perception, \nand can above all represent a shared historical experience, such as the African Americans in the \nUnited States”.36 Perception is of paramount importance for the legal definition of a racial group in \nthe crime of genocide, as this article will demonstrate.\nThe so-called races of humankind are recognized to be incidental and arbitrary social \nmechanisms invented during the eighteenth century; they helped organize the populations \nencountered and conquered during European colonialism.37 Thus, race became a by-product of \nEurope’s religious, economic and imperial expansion during colonialism.38 However, Benedict \nAnderson, the author of Imagined Communities, disagrees that race originates in colonialism; and \ninstead finds its origin in ideologies of class, for example, the claim of contamination of  “white” \nor “blue” (aristocratic) blood by inferior (racial) classes.39 The idea of blood purity has transgressed \nmany societies, for instance, during the Jim Crow legislation in the United States, when most \nSouthern states adopted the “one-drop rule”, according to which an individual with any black \nancestry was deemed black.40\nWhen the Genocide Convention was drafted, the contemporary understanding of race heavily \ninfluenced its legal correlative. The reference to races was not uncommon at the time. Indeed, race \nwas perceived as a combination of two concepts. The first concept embraces the notion of nation \nstates as well as sub-groups of people.41 The second concept contains the idea of biologically distinct \nraces, determined by their bloodline.42 The Polish-Jewish lawyer, Raphael Lemkin, created the term \nObjections (1996), para. 31.\n32 UN Doc.

William Schabas, “Groups Protected by the Genocide Convention,” ILSA Journal for \nInternational and Comparative Law (2000), 381.\n42 This can be inferred from the fact that the Genocide Convention was drafted in reaction to the Holocaust, and as such \nwas influenced by historical facts (Machteld Boot, Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity, War Crimes: Nullum Crimen Sine \nLege and the Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (Antwerpen, Intersentia (2002)), 417).\n', 'Lingaas\n©2016     Genocide Studies and Prevention 10, no. 1 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.10.1.1377\n84\ngenocide by combining two words genos (ancient Greek for race or tribe) and cide (from the Latin \nword caedere for to kill).43 Lemkin’s study Axis Rule in Occupied Europe, which first formulated the \nproposed crime of genocide, illustrates that the different European nations or subgroups like the \nGermans, Poles and Jews were seen as different races.44\nYet the concept of race was also shaped by the Nazi racial ideology. The Holocaust was still \nongoing when Lemkin published his book, and undoubtedly the Nazi propaganda terminology \ninfluenced his use of the term race. The Nazi racial ideology demanded the purity of the Aryan \nblood. Adolf Hitler created the concept a homogenous German people as the Aryan master race \n(the so-called Herrenrasse) in an attempt to justify genocide as a sacred purpose of the biologically \nsuperior German people.45 Differences between the Aryan and Jewish race were “biologized into \nan immutable physiological essence that could not be changed”.46 As such, the Jewish race was \nportrayed as unhuman, a threat to the Aryan race and had therefore to be completely destroyed.47 \nThe Nazi racial legislation in the Nuremberg laws48 determined Jewry according to blood \nrelationship and in particular as far back as grandparental inheritance.49 Races were accordingly \ndefined by biology and heredity.\nIn the past fifty years, the concept of race has changed considerably. In particular, the conflation \nof race with nationality has ceased. Nowadays it would be rather surprising if anyone referred to \nthe Poles, Dutch or Jews as a separate race. The scientific progress in genetics and biology of the \npast decades determined that there is no gene for race and that it is scientifically incorrect to speak \nof different human races.50 In its final report, the Commission of Experts on Rwanda emphasized \nthat “to recognize that there exists discrimination on racial or ethnic grounds, it is not necessary \nto presume or posit the existence of race or ethnicity itself as a scientifically objective fact”.51 \nColloquially, however, the meaning of race is still very much linked to the outer appearance of \npeople, particularly skin color. In conclusion it can be noted that there are no biologically different \nhuman races.52 Yet people’s features are still commonly used to determine their race. The next \nsection reveals the limitations of the Genocide Convention, especially when the victim group is not \neasily defined as a national, racial, ethnical or religious group.\nPractical Significance: Rwanda and Cambodia\nThe designation of a genocidal victim to one of the four protected groups is not only of theoretical \nimportance; the group membership of the victim is an element of the crime of genocide.53 If the \nvictim cannot be classified as a member of a racial, ethnical, national or religious group, the crime \n43 Raphael Lemkin, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation, Analysis of Government, Proposals for Redress (Washington: \nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace, Division of International Law, 1944), 79.\n44 Lemkin, Axis Rule in Europe, 87-88.\n45 Henry Jr. King, “Genocide and Nuremberg,” in The Criminal Law of Genocide, ed.

Two examples illustrate the practical significance of the narrow protection \nawarded by the Genocide Convention: Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge from 1975-1979 and \nRwanda during the 1994 genocide. These examples will not specifically deal with the racial group. \nInstead, they intend to show the difficulties to determine the groups protected by the Genocide \nConvention.\nThe atrocities committed in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge regime have occasionally been \nlabelled auto-genocide since the Khmer Rouge regime targeted parts of its own citizens.54 Most \nvictims were intellectuals, bourgeoisie, other political or social class enemies, as well as urban \nresidents, and belonged to the Khmer majority group.55 A 1985 UN report concluded that the \ndefinition of genocide did not exclude cases, in which the victims were part of the violator’s \nown group.56 Indeed, the perpetrators and the majority of the victims were members of the same \nnationality, religion, ethnicity and race: they were all Khmer. The crimes committed were possibly \nnot genocidal acts, because they targeted primarily political, economic or social groups.57 But the \nKhmer Rouge regime also targeted ethnic Vietnamese and the Cham Muslim minority group.58 \nThe charges in the trial at the UN-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia \n(ECCC) against Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan (Case 002/02) include genocide against these two \nminority groups only, precisely because of the limitations of the Genocide Convention to protect \nfour exhaustive categories of groups.59 In 1999, a UN report by a Group of Experts classified “the \nMuslim Cham as an ethnic and religious group; the Vietnamese communities as an ethnic and, \nperhaps, a racial group; and the Buddhist monkhood as a religious group”.60 The report reads \nfurthermore: “whether the Khmer Rouge committed genocide with respect to part of the Khmer \nnational group turns on complex interpretative issues, especially concerning the Khmer Rouge’s \nintent with respect to its non-minority-group victims”.61 The Group of Experts did not further \nqualify the crimes committed. The trial in the case 002/02 before the ECCC will have to reach a \nverdict whether the Khmer Rouge committed genocide and whether the victims fall under one of \nthe four protected groups. The indictment did not include genocide against the Khmer national \ngroup. Thus, the likely outcome is a conviction of the accused for genocide against the Muslim \nCham and the Vietnamese minority groups.\nThe other example that shows the narrow protection of the Genocide Convention is Rwanda. \nThere was a risk that the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide would be acquitted because their \nvictims could not be qualified as members of an ethnical, racial, national or religious group. Indeed, \none of the main challenges for the ICTR was the classification of the Hutu and Tutsi as two distinct \ngroups, as subsequent sections of this paper will discuss. Technically speaking, the Tutsi and Hutu \ndid not belong to different ethnicities.62 According to Katy Grady “it is virtually impossible, on an \nobjective, factual level, to distinguish between Tutsi and Hutu”.63 Other scholars suggest that the \n54 Fournet, Crime of Destruction, 48.

But not only Tutsi became victims of the \natrocities. Hutu moderates, who sympathized with the Tutsi, were also targeted. Since the Hutu \nwere not targeted for reasons of group membership, but rather for taking a political stance, these \ncrimes could not be legally qualified as genocide.68\nFour Corner Posts\nThere is an ongoing scholarly debate as to the usefulness of distinguishing the four protected \ngroups.69 William Schabas suggests using the four terms - national, ethnical, racial and religious \n- as “four corner posts that delimit an area within which a [sic] myriad of groups covered by the \nConvention find protection”,70 whereby the groups are in a dynamic and synergistic relationship, \neach contributing to the construction of the other.71 This approach, which sees no need to definitively \nassign the victim to one particular group, because of multiple group characteristics, has also been \ncalled ensemble or holistic approach.72 There is undoubtedly a risk of an overlap between the four \ncategories. However, the creation of a generic, undefined group contradicts the internationally \nrecognized maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat, where each word in a legal text carries its distinct \nmeaning.73 Difficulties in defining the protected groups should not lead to creating an undefined \narea, in which myriad of groups are contained within the four corner posts of nationality, ethnicity, \nrace and religion. The intention of the Genocide Convention’s drafters was to limit the protection \nto racial, ethnical, national and religious groups. The expansion of the Convention to an undefined \nnumber of groups would contradict its objective of a restrictive application.74 Lars Berster considers \nsuch a de facto dissolution of a key element of the crime not to be reconcilable with the principle of \nlegality.75\nInternational Law and Policy in Honour of Navanethem Pillay, ed.

The victims are reduced to one aspect of their identity and stigmatized because of that \nparticular dimension, thereby rendering other dimensions of their identity marginal.76 Such process \noccurred, for example, in Germany prior to the Holocaust. The Nazi ideology determined that the \nJews were a distinct group and could no longer be part of the racially defined German nation. Their \nJewishness became the defining identity marker.77 It is, in other words, the perpetrator’s perception \nof the victims that determines whether or not they are covered by the protection of Art. II Genocide \nConvention. Helen Klann and Phillipa KcKenzie note that “in cases where it is unclear whether a \nvictim belonged to a protected group, the perception of the perpetrator is most relevant. Where \nthe perpetrator perceived the victim as belonging to a group, the victim should be considered to \nbelong to that group”.78 Caroline Fournet emphasizes that the Genocide Convention “wrongly \naffords protection to ‘racial’ groups, in spite of the fact that there are no such groups except in the \nminds of the perpetrators”.79 The perpetrator identifies his victims by what he perceives to be their \ndecisive characteristic.\nAccording to the Darfur Commission, the principle of effectiveness dictated that international \nrules were to be given maximum effect – or in its Latin terms ut res magis valeat quam pereat, thereby \nsuggesting that Art. II Genocide Convention should be construed as effectively as possible, \nin light of its object and purpose.80 The ICJ recognized the principle of effectiveness as “one of \nthe fundamental principles of interpretation of treaties, consistently upheld by international \njurisprudence”.81 According to this principle, the terms of a treaty are ensured effectiveness in \nconsideration of its object and purpose together with good faith, the so-called effet utile.82 Hence, \nArt. II Genocide Convention has to be interpreted effectively, giving maximum effect to all the \nprotected groups, including the racial group. In sum, an ensemble approach that delimits a broader \narea of protection is inconsistent with the principle of legality, the principle of effectiveness, and \nthe perpetrator’s perception of the victim group. The four corner post-approach is flawed and \ntherefore not ideal.\nThe following section gives an overview on how legal scholarship and the jurisprudence of the \nad hoc ICTY and ICTR have defined the protected groups of genocide. It will reveal the great legal \nuncertainty that exists about the nature of human differences.\nRace and Legal Scholarship\nWhat Is Race?\nThere is no gene for race. There exist no genes that are shared by all members of one race and that \ncould explain a common racial appearance; no DNA has been identified that is not also present \nat substantial levels in other races, thereby failing to sort individuals into different racial groups.83 \nInstead, it has become accepted that races are social constructs rather than a biological given.84 At \n76 Nersessian, Genocide and Political Groups, 29.

By relying on complexion, the victims of the crime of genocide are classified \nobjectively. However, do all people with dark skin belong to the same race? Is it correct to objectively \ngroup the victims according to their appearance?\nThe concept of race causes difficulties to international criminal law because of the legal \nnecessity of an objective determination of the victim’s group membership. In order to achieve a \nconviction for the crime of genocide, the prosecution has to prove that the perpetrator targeted a \nnational, religious, ethnical or racial group. This requirement leads courts to objectively defining \nrace based on the victim’s complexion. As long as the racial group is considered a material element \nof a crime, it has to be objectively determinable. As a result, international criminal courts resort to \noutdated ways of classifying human beings.\nInstead of reverting to controversial ways of defining different human races by means \nexternally perceptible attributes, race should be defined as the perception of a person’s differentness. \nThis subjective approach, according to which perception rather than objectively discernable \ncharacteristics are decisive, is precisely what the theory of imagined identities relies upon. Before \ndiscussing the theory of imagined identities, the next section will show how race is understood by \nlegal scholarship.\nLegal Scholarship on race\nThe following examples illustrate the current legal scholarship on race in international criminal \nlaw. Hans Vest refers to physical characteristics or biological ancestry when defining race,88 while \nLawrence LeBlanc defines race as “associated with physical characteristics of a people such as color \nof skin”.89 Daniel Ntanda Nsereko classifies different “racial groups (…) according to genetically \ntransmitted differences”90 and “[e]ach group has physical features that are hereditary [including] \npractical social purposes, ‘race’ is not so much a biological phenomenon as social myth”, in Four Statements on the Race \nQuestion, ed. UNESCO (1969), 33. The 1967 UNESCO statement confirms that “racist doctrines lack any scientific basis \nwhatsoever” (UNESCO, “Statement on Race and Racial Prejudice of 1967,” in Four Statements on the Race Question, ed. \nUNESCO (1969).  \nEven the International Haplotype Map Project, which is a multi-country effort to identify and catalogue genetic \nsimilarities and differences in human beings, states on its webpage that race was “an imprecise and mostly socially \nconstructed category,” accessed April 1, 2016. http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/citinghapmap.html.  \nSee also Banton, Racial Theories, 196.

Implying that race is genetically transmittable is scientifically baseless \nand furthermore incoherent with the current understanding of race as a social construct rather than \na biological fact.92 Matthew Lippman claims that “[t]he concept of racial groups is self-evident”93 \nand Francis Boyle, agent of the state applicant in the Case on the Application of the Genocide Convention \nbefore the ICJ argues that “[t]he concepts of racial and religious groups are self-evident”.94 Finally, \nGerhard Werle and Florian Jessberger define a racial group as a social group whose members \nexhibited the same inherited, visible physical traits, such as skin colour or physical stature.95 They \ntoo rely on an objective approach, whereby people can be categorized on the basis of their features \nand inherited characteristics. As shown above, there is no gene for race. Race can therefore not be \ninherited. A reliance on heredity should consequently be avoided in defining race. This is confirmed \nby Michael Banton, former Chair of the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination \nand an authority in the studies on racial discrimination, who considers race in some cases to have \nno real basis in heredity whatsoever.96\nThe above mentioned scholarly definitions either avoid defining a racial group or relate \nto outdated conceptions of race, based on the wrongful understanding that there exist clearly \ndistinguishable racial groups with distinct physical appearances and qualities.97 There is no \nbiological foundation for race. Any kind of categorization of people by means of their features \nis scientifically incorrect and offensive. This raises the question of how race should be correctly \ndefined.\nDifferent Approaches to Defining the Victim Groups of Genocide\nArt. II Genocide Convention protects four specific groups. The subjective and objective approaches \nto defining these protected groups rival each other.98 An objective approach relies on verifiable, \nhard facts. Neither the views of the victim, the perpetrator nor any third party can influence the \ndefinition of the group and the membership criteria.99 A subjective approach is based on perception, \npersonal opinions and interpretations. The subjective test accepts the group as defined by the \nperpetrator. His view becomes dispositive of the group-defining criteria.100\nTo objectively define a person by his or her complexion, anatomy or other physical markers, \nassumes that there exist different racial groups, which can be distinguished from each other by \nmeans of their appearance.101 David Nersessian rightfully concludes that there was a practical \nimpossibility of defining groups in any way other than subjectively, namely by utilizing the \nperpetrator’s perception. He notes that the “efforts to define protected groups objectively have \n91 Ibid.\n92 See above footnote 84.\n93 Matthew Lippman, “Genocide,” in International Criminal Law: Sources, Subjects, and Contents, ed.

He also establishes a difference in the European and the US perspective on race (ibid., viii). \n98 Quayle, “Unimaginable Evil”, 368.\n99 Nersessian, Genocide and Political Groups, 27.\n100 Ibid. \n101 Banton, Racial Theories, 198.\n', 'Lingaas\n©2016     Genocide Studies and Prevention 10, no. 1 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.10.1.1377\n90\nproved largely artificial, suffer from serious analytical flaws, and in any case bear no relation to the \ngroup ultimately targeted”.102\nIn the subjective approach, the perpetrator identifies the victim’s group membership. \nNevertheless, the identification of the group membership cannot completely be left to the \nperpetrator’s imagination, because this would inevitably lead to a broadening of the exclusive \nvictim groups of genocide.103 If the perpetrator alone defines the racial group, he could possibly \nperceive blue-eyed men – or women, for the sake of the argument – as a distinct race. This would \nconflict with the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention, which offers narrow protection \nto a limited number of enumerated groups.\nInstead, the subjective approach has to be sufficiently specific and foreseeable in order to \ncohere with the principle of legality. The subsequent section outlines the theory of imagined \nidentity, which builds on a subjective approach, and shows its relevance for the crime of genocide. \nThereafter, the jurisprudence by the ad hoc international criminal tribunals on the protected groups \nof genocide is analyzed. The legal analysis ends with the Darfur Commission’s report as well as \nthe jurisprudence by the ICC.\nImagined Identities\nBenedict Anderson (1936-2015) was a professor in political science and author of one of the most \nimportant concepts in political geography, namely that nations are “imagined communities”.104 \nAnderson is recognized as one of the most influential scholars of his generation and his book from \n1986 (revised edition 2006), Imagined Communities, is a standard work with worldwide impact across \nacademic disciplines.105 He asserts that nationalism was created by a feeling of togetherness in a \nnation state, despite not knowing its other members.106 This feeling was so strong that its members \nwere willing to die for their – imagined – nation by serving the nation’s army and participating in \narmed conflicts.107 Other scholars acknowledge that nationalism is commonly viewed as inherently \nirrational in the sense that it transcends considerations of self-interest.108 According to Anderson, \nthe nation is a social construct that ties together strangers and creates a sense of togetherness, which \nmanifests itself in language, tradition, music, literature and pride of being part of that respective \nnation. Importantly, nationalism is created by beliefs and felt kinship ties. The emphasis is on felt \n– or imagined – subjective claims.109\nBy applying this concept to a group of people connected to each other not by a nation, but by \nrace, ethnicity or religion, a similar construct is created: people perceive likewise persons as similar \nand form groups of like-minded. Simultaneously they perceive others, outside their own group, \nas different.110 Although not necessarily grounded in a real, objective differentiation between the \ngroups, this distinction is nevertheless solidified over time, thereby creating two distinct groups: \n“us” and “them”. Ultimately, the groups are not real, but socially constructed and therefore \nimagined.\nFor the crime of genocide it is essential to pinpoint the perceptions of different identities, the \n“us” versus “them”. This so-called othering occurs in genocide for racial groups as much as for \nthe other protected groups. The dichotomies between us and them are emphasized, whereby the \n102 Ibid., 31-32.\n103 Ibid., 31.\n104 Euan Hague, “Benedict Anderson,” in Key Thinkers on Space and Place, ed.

This process is demonstrated in the \nfollowing examples.\nThe case of Rwanda exemplarily shows that the Hutu and Tutsi were very similar groups, \nlargely sharing the same nationality, religion, language and traditions.114 The German and later the \nBelgian colonizers perceived the Tutsi to be more like them in height and color and established the \nTutsi as the indigenous elite.115 A Belgian law of 1931 determined that whoever owned more than \nten cows was a Tutsi and thereby created a wealth-based system of division.116 The introduction of \nidentity cards during Belgian colonialism consolidated the membership to the Tutsi, Hutu or \nTwa group and simultaneously implanted the vision of Tutsi superiority; the membership to one \nof the three groups was therefore primarily a result of a social attribution process.117 Jan Pronk \nnames Rwanda as an example of imagined communities due to the imagined physical and mental \nsuperiority of the Tutsi and the inferiority of the Hutu.118 Payam Akhavan furthermore emphasizes \nthat the distinction of Hutu and Tutsi “was born of racialist mythology, gradually assumed a \nsocially constructed reality, and ultimately defined the population slated for extermination”.119 \nThe different groups were constructed as a collective imaginary, as social constructs rather than \nobjectively defined groups.120\nThe propaganda preceding the genocide in Rwanda was based on the Hutu’s feeling \nof inferiority and found its valve in a reversing of positions: the Tutsi, who were imagined as \nsuperior to the Hutu, were inferiorated by means of hate speech, termed “cockroaches” \nand ultimately targeted for extermination.121 The Tutsi were portrayed as the enemy from \nwithin that needed to be stopped before it swallowed the suppressed Hutu culture.122 \nThis imagined fear of the other manifested itself in the official propaganda and \n111 Anthonie Holslag, “The Process of Othering from the ‘Social Imaginaire’ to Physical Acts: An Anthropological \nApproach,” Genocide Studies and Prevention: An International Journal 9 (2015), 96.

The collapse of the League \nof Communists in 1990 and the interconnected disintegration of Yugoslavia into its warring factions \nmarked the end of a common Yugoslav national identity. The imagined community of Yugoslavia \nbecame unimaginable from 1991-1992 onwards.124 For example, the Serbs in Croatia identified \nthemselves for decades as Yugoslavs. Due to the events in the early 1990s, however, they started \nperceiving themselves as Serbs in Croatia instead of under the former common denominator of \nYugoslavs.125 Socially relevant groups were created that perceived each other as distinct. Similarly \nto Rwanda, the dichotomization led to an identification of us versus them.\nThe theory of imagined identities was for the first time applied to international criminal law in \nthe 2005 Report by the Darfur Commission. The Darfur report will be analyzed more in depth in the \nfollowing section. With reference to a scholarly article by Guglielmo Verdirame, the Commission \nemphasized that “collective identities (…) are by their very nature social constructs, ‘imagined’ \nidentities entirely dependent on variable and contingent perceptions, and not social facts”.126 While \nthe idea of imagined, as opposed to factual or real, identities is appealing because it avoids any \nobjective definition of the protected group, it nevertheless has to be coherent with the principle of \nstrict legality. The theory of imagined identities, which builds on a subjective approach to group \nmembership, cannot go beyond the narrow definition of Art. II Genocide Convention and cannot \nrender invalid the principle of foreseeability and specificity. The imagination of the perpetrator \ncan, in other words, not exceed the Genocide Convention’s understanding of the protected victim \ngroups.\nThe current understanding of race as a subjective and social concept, with the perception of \nthe perpetrator as the key element, points to the application of the theory of imagined identities \nin praxis. The perpetrator perceives a victim as belonging to a different group, which he imagines \nhaving different and inferior attributes and qualities. This imagined inferiority then gives the \nperpetrator, in his eyes, a justification to discriminate and ultimately to exterminate this imaginary \ngroup. The identity of the others and their differences to us is passed on from one generation to the \nnext by means of narratives. These accounts formulate and solidify the conception of the others’ \npersonhood and thereby their identity.127\nSuch historical and sociological narratives harden prejudices about the victims: the others have \n“always” been different, they have “never” been part of the society at large, but have “persistently” \nchosen to remain in their own community. The imagined social construct of two different groups \nbecomes a reality as soon as it is effective. This effectiveness is demonstrated in that the in-group \ntreats the out-group (the others) as real. In doing so, the creation of a social reality is revealed that \neventually entails social and/or legal consequences. This formation of an imagined identity is in \nitself not further disquieting. However, if the effectiveness results in stigmatization, inferiorization, \ndehumanization and ultimately the aim of destruction, the risk of genocide is imminent.128\nThe example of Rwanda shows this development clearly: prior to the colonialization, the \nHutu and Tutsi group membership was fluid and unsettled: wealth enabled ascension of the social \n123 Deutsch and Yanay, “Politics of Intimacy”, 22.\n124 Robert Hayden, “Imagined Communities and Real Victims: Self-Determination and Ethnic Cleansing in Yugoslavia,” \nin Genocide: An Anthropological Reader, ed.

Intermarriage between the groups \nwas common.129 The introduction of identity cards by the Belgium colonizers changed the picture \ndrastically: group membership became more or less permanent and immutable. A person’s identity \nwas defined in one of the three categories (Hutu, Tutsi and Twa) and considered innate by means \nof patrilineal heredity of ethnicity.130 The colonial masters created and imposed a largely imaginary \nsystem of group membership. This system of identification became unalterable, operational and \ntherefore also effective once the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa started using their ID-cards.\nRace, ethnicity, nationality and religion become operational concepts of group membership \nonce an effective system has been put into place. Whether imagined systems are founded \non fictional or real grounds is irrelevant: distinct groups are created and thereby objectified. \nThus, effectiveness and operationability determine the membership to a racial, ethnical, \nnational or religious group. Or in other words: once a group membership is operational, it \nbecomes effective and real.\nThe next section will analyze selected examples of case law by the ad hoc international criminal \ntribunals as well as the Darfur Commission’s report. It will reveal that jurisprudence has gradually \nshifted from defining the victim groups objectively to defining them subjectively, based primarily \nupon the perception of the perpetrator. It will in particular show that the Darfur Commission \napplied the theory of imagined identity. The jurisprudence of the ICC on the situation of Darfur, \nwhich largely builds upon the Darfur Commission’s report, will also be analyzed. The ICC’s initial \nsteps in dealing with the crime of genocide in the situation of Darfur will provide an outlook on \nfuture developments in the definition of the protected groups.\nRace in International Criminal Jurisprudence\nThe interpretation by the international criminal tribunals of the crime of genocide and the protected \ngroups are far from specific or foreseeable. While this is true for all of the four protected groups, it is \nparticularly significant for the racial group. As such, the tribunals’ judgments might challenge the \nprinciple of legality. For future cases it is important that the tribunals fully recognize and respect \nlegal certainty and predictability in their interpretation of the protected groups of genocide.131\nThe jurisprudence of the ICTR and the ICTY on the group definition is incoherent because \nit varies in its approach to defining the protected groups. Early cases took a primarily objective \napproach, while later cases increasingly relied on the perpetrator’s perception of the victim group, \nthus applying a subjective approach. The following examples reveal the inconsistency of the \njudicial approaches.\nICTR Jurisprudence\nThe ICTR produced the first case law on the crime of genocide and in particular the racial group. \nIn the first ever genocide trial in history, The Prosecutor v. Akayesu, the Trial Chamber defined a \nracial group as follows: “The conventional definition of racial group is based on the hereditary \nphysical traits often identified with a geographical region, irrespective of linguistic, cultural, \nnational or religious factors”.132 The Trial Chamber did not cite any authority for its definition. This \nprimarily objective approach to a racial group is ambiguous since it refers to heredity and implies \nan identification of group members by means of their genetically defined physical traits. As shown \nearlier, a reference to heredity preserves an outdated and contentious method of classifying people. \nThe Trial Chamber, however, weakened its statement by referring to “the conventional definition”, \n129 Lyal Sunga, The Emerging System of International Criminal Law: Developments in Codification and Implementation (The \nHague, Kluwer Law International, 2010), 112.

The judges remained silent on what is considered a nonconventional\ndefinition of race.\nFurthermore, the judgment mentions the identification of these traits with a geographical \nregion. The Trial Chamber thereby partially resorts to a subjective approach, whereby the term \n“identified” points to the perpetrator’s perception of the victim group’s racial affiliation to its \ngeographical location or origin. In Akayesu, the ICTR defined race foremost by heredity. Hereditary \nphysical traits are objective, factual elements. The approach taken by the Trial Chamber is therefore \nforemost an objective one.133 However, it also noted that these hereditary traits were often identified \nwith a geographical region. The word “often” indicates an ordinary, but not exclusive approach to \ndefining race. The word “identity” clearly connects to a person’s perception, thus a subjective act. \nThe overall approach taken by the ICTR is therefore a primarily objective approach with certain \nsubjective elements.134\nOnly one year after the Akayesu trial judgment, the same bench of judges rendered the trial \njudgment against Georges Anderson Nderubumwe Rutaganda. It pronounced a more balanced \ndefinition of the victim group by stating that the membership was a subjective rather than an objective \nconcept.135 The Tribunal in case further held that the “victim is perceived by the perpetrator of \ngenocide as belonging to a group slated for destruction. In some instances, the victim may perceive \nhimself/ herself as belonging to the said group”.136 By emphasizing perception, Rutaganda took a \nsubjective approach and shifted away from the primarily objective approach taken in Akayesu.137\nThe ICTR Bagilishema trial judgment of 2001 demonstrated the difficulties of an objective group \ndefinition. It held that, although indicative definitions of these four terms have been provided,\nthe concepts of national, ethnical, racial, and religious groups enjoy no generally or \ninternationally accepted definition. Each of these concepts must be assessed in the light \nof a particular political, social, historical, and cultural context. Although membership of \nthe targeted group must be an objective feature of the society in question, there is also a \nsubjective dimension. 138\nHere, in a footnote, the Trial Chamber refers to the above-mentioned report by the Commission of \nExperts on Rwanda and its statement that “to recognise that there exists discrimination on racial \nor ethnic grounds, it is not necessary to presume or posit the existence of race or ethnicity itself as \na scientifically objective fact”.139 The judgment further reads:\nA group may not have precisely defined boundaries (…). Moreover, the perpetrators \nof genocide may characterize the targeted group in ways that do not fully correspond to \nconceptions of the group shared generally, or by other segments of society. In such a case \n(…) if a victim was perceived by a perpetrator as belonging to a protected group, the victim \ncould be considered by the Chamber as a member of the protected group, for the purposes \nof genocide.140\n133 Matthias Schuster, “The Crime of Genocide Applied in Practice: Selected Aspects of the Jurisprudence of the Ad Hoc \nTribunals’ Appeals Chambers,” in The Genocide Convention Sixty Years After its Adoption, ed.

The perpetrator’s perception of the victims’ \ngroup membership was crucial: he intended to destroy them because of their perceived or real \ngroup membership, irrespective of how the group is conceived by other segments of society. In sum, \nthe Bagilishema trial judgment took a primarily subjective approach with some objective elements \nand as such further consolidated the innovative, subjective definition of group membership.141 \nAccording to Barbara Lüders, Bagilishema was the turning point in the ICTR’s jurisprudence from \nan objective to a subjective approach.142 The fact that the Kayishema and Ruzindana trial judgment of \n1999 laid the groundwork for a subjective approach challenges this opinion.143 The Kayishema and \nRuzindana judgment defined an ethnic group as one “whose members share a common language \nand culture; or, a group which distinguishes itself, as such (self identification); or, a group identified \nas such by others, including perpetrators of the crimes (identification of others)”.144 Apparently \ninspired by the Akayesu trial judgment, it defined the racial group as follows: “a racial group is \nbased on hereditary physical traits often identified with geography”.145 While the Trial Chamber \nsubjectively defined the ethnical group by means of self-identification or identification of others, it \ndefined the racial group objectively.\nThe ICTR Appeals Chamber has not often dealt with the definition of the protected groups of \ngenocide. On one rare occasion, the Appeals Chamber in Nahimana et al. recognized the application \nof a subjective approach: “[T]he jurisprudence of the ad hoc Tribunals acknowledges that the \nperception of the perpetrators of the crimes may in some circumstance be taken into account for \nthe purposes of determining membership of a protected group”.146 It decided that the attacks on \nHutu political opponents were not acts of genocide because the victims were acknowledged as \nsuch and not perceived as Tutsi.147\nIn 2000, the ICTR in Semanza declared the division of the Rwandan population into three \nethnical groups a fact of common knowledge.148 Declaring a fact common knowledge removes \nit from being a subject to dispute and includes it into a list of common or universally known \nhistorical, geographical facts, or the laws of nature, such as the days of the week.149 According to \nthe Tribunal, common knowledge also covered those facts that were generally known within a \ntribunal’s territorial jurisdiction.150 The consequence of declaring the ethnic grouping as a fact of \ncommon knowledge is that no further proof is necessary, since the existence of the Tutsi group as \na protected ethnic group is determined.151 Although the Trial Chamber emphasized that it could \nnot “take judicial notice of matters, which are unadorned legal conclusions”,152 it in effect evaded \n141 Interestingly, in the ICJ Case Concerning Application of Genocide Convention (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and \nMontenegro), the legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro claimed that the ICTR in Bagilishema had adopted \nan exclusively objective approach. According to the representative, the ICTR concluded that the group membership \nshould be an objective element of society in question. The legal counsel thereby disregarded that Bagilishema dealt \nwith the perpetrator’s perception of the protected group, hence taking into account the subjective elements in defining \na group membership (Case Concerning Application of Genocide Convention, Document No. CR 2006/43, Public Sitting \n(May 8, 2006), 36-37).\n142 Barbara Lüders, Die Strafbarkeit von Völkermord nach dem Römischen Statut für den Internationalen Strafgerichtshof (Berlin: \nBerliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2004), 57.\n143 The Prosecutor v.

The ICTR Appeals Chamber also took notice of the \ngenocide in Rwanda against the Tutsi ethnic group, thereby accepting as common knowledge the \nexistence of the Tutsi as a protected group.153 Matthias Schuster laments that the appellate bodies of \nthe ad hoc tribunals did not clarify “the law on such a central element of the definition of the crime \nof genocide”.154\nICTY Jurisprudence\nIn May 1993, acting under Chapter VII of UN Charter, the UN established the ICTY in response to \nmass atrocities then taking place in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.155 The ICTY was the first \ninternational war crimes tribunal since the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals following the Second \nWorld War. In one of the Tribunal’s most important cases, the Jelisić judgment, the Trial Chamber \nacknowledged that an objective approach to defining the victim group of genocide was a risky \nundertaking:\nto define a... racial group today using objective and scientifically irreproachable criteria would \nbe a perilous exercise whose result would not necessarily correspond to the perception of \nthe persons concerned by such categorisation. Therefore, it is more appropriate to evaluate \nthe status of a... racial group from the point of view of those persons who wish to single \nthat group out from the rest of the community. The Trial Chamber consequently elects to \nevaluate membership in a… racial group using a subjective criterion.156\nAt first sight the Jelisić judgment seemed to allow a victim- as well as a perpetrator-based \napproach (“perception of the persons concerned by such categorization”). However, the \nconsecutive sentence makes clear that the perpetrator alone defines the victim group (“point of \nview of those persons who wish to single that group out”). The judgment correctly recognized that \nit was applying a subjective approach.\nThe Trial Chamber in the judgment against Radoslav Brđanin took a slightly different \nsubjective approach by holding that the victim group “may be identified by means of the \nsubjective criterion of the stigmatization of the group, notably by the perpetrators of the crime, \non the basis of its perceived… racial… characteristics. In some instances, the victim may perceive \nhimself or herself to belong to the aforesaid group”.157 This judgment provided two possibilities \nto defining the protected groups, namely either a perpetrator- or a victim-based approach. The \nwording “notably by the perpetrators” reveals a primacy of a perpetrator-based approach, which \nis further confirmed in that “in some instances, the victim may perceive himself or herself to belong \nto the aforesaid group”. As a rule, the tribunal seemed to rely on the perpetrator’s perception. \nOccasionally, however, also the victim’s perception could influence the group definition. The \njudges nevertheless demanded objective criteria, without indicating their scope, in holding that \n“the correct determination of the relevant protected group has to be made on a case-by-case basis, \nconsulting both objective and subjective criteria. This is so because subjective criteria alone may \nnot be sufficient to determine the group targeted for destruction and protected by the Genocide \nConvention”.158 The Trial Chamber acknowledged that a subjective approach alone could cause \nan inadmissible broadening of the protected groups, which would conflict with the principle of \nstrict legality and foreseeability. However, the judges did not recognize the possibility of relying \non a subjective approach that builds on the theory of imagined identities. According to that theory, \nProsecutor v.

Nevertheless, neither \nad hoc tribunal ever took a purely subjective approach and always required some objectively \ndefinable components, however without sketching out their contours.\nApart from the jurisprudence by the two trial chambers of the ad hoc tribunals, there has been \nlimited case law on the international level defining the protected groups of genocide. This article \nwill not examine the jurisprudence of the Nuremberg or Tokyo Tribunals, the ECCC, the Special \nPanels of the Dili District Court, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon or the Special Court for Sierra \nLeone, some of which do not even have subject-matter jurisdiction over the crime of genocide. \nHowever, the Commission of Inquiry on Darfur comprehensively dealt with the definition of the \nprotected groups and referred to imagined identities. Its report is therefore of particular interest \nfor the further analysis.\nReport by the Darfur Commission\nIn 2004, a UN Security Council resolution requested the establishment of the Darfur Commission. \nIts tasks were to immediately investigate reports of violations of international law in Darfur, \nto determine whether acts of genocide had occurred, and to identify the perpetrators of such \nviolations.159 As a Commission of Inquiry, the Darfur Commission was not a judicial organ. \nHowever, it was headed by renowned ICTY Judge and Professor of Law Antonio Cassese and \nwas mandated to make a legal assessment of the situation in Darfur. The Commission produced a \ncomprehensive quasi-legal report that resembles a trial judgment, but was not legally binding.160 \nThe report notes that although “it is not a judicial body… the Commission adopted an approach \nproper to a judicial body”.161 The methods applied and the analysis performed were undoubtedly \nof a legal character.\nThe Commission was challenged by the fact that crimes were committed against different \ntribal groups (chiefly the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa tribes) that did not appear to make up ethnic \ngroups distinct from the ethnic group to which the attackers belonged.162 The Commission found \nthat the tribes who supported the insurgents were increasingly perceived as African, while those \nsupporting the government were perceived as Arabs, even though there were no objective grounds \nfor such distinctions, since both groups shared the same faith and spoke the same language.163 The \nrift between the tribes, and the political polarization around the rebel opposition to the central \nauthorities, coupled with the growing insistence of some circles and the media on such an ArabAfrican\ndivide, contributed to “the consolidation of the contrast and gradually created a marked \npolarization in the perception and self-perception of the groups concerned”.164\nThe Darfur Commission determined that the formation process of perceiving another group \nas distinct usually originated in historical and social grounds. The others were perceived as making \nup a different and opposed group. The process “gradually hardens and crystallizes into a real and \nfactual opposition. It thus leads to an objective contrast”.165 Despite originating in perception, the \ngroups eventually became objectively distinguishable groups.166 Thereby the Darfur Commission \nseemingly added an additional category to the existing objective and subjective approaches in \n159 UN Doc. S/RES/1564 (September 18, 2004), para. 12.\n160 Darfur Report, UN Doc. S/2005/60 (January 25, 2005).\n161 Darfur Report, para. 14. \n162 Ibid., para. 508. \n163 Ibid., paras. 508 and 509.

It is, however, unclear how much \ntime would have to pass in order for an objectified approach to occur. The Darfur Report does not \nanswer this question. It could be assumed that a subjective perception could become objectified in \nthe course of a generation, perhaps an even shorter period of time.\nNot only did the Darfur Commission construct a new approach to defining the protected \ngroups of genocide, it also mentioned imagined identities:\nthe approach taken to determine whether a group is a (fully) protected one has evolved \nfrom an objective to a subjective standard to take into account that collective identities… are \nby their very nature social constructs, ‘imagined’ identities entirely dependent on variable \nand contingent perceptions, and not social facts, which are verifiable in the same manner as \nnatural phenomena or physical facts.168\nThe Darfur Commission finds that the protected groups of genocide are social constructs rather \nthan social facts. Essentially, the victim groups are imagined identities based on the perception \nof their differentness. In its essence, the Darfur Report describes the phenomenon of othering, \nwhich has been mentioned above. In the case of Darfur, the process of othering was revealed by \nthe creation of the binaries of Arab and African tribes, the latter being portrayed as inferior. The \nCommission found that a growing polarization of identities increasingly led to a consolidation of \nthe contrasts between the tribes.169 Eventually, the concerned tribes perceived themselves as either \nAfrican or Arab and began making up distinct groups. Derogatory epithets with the intention \nof stigmatizing, inferiorating and ultimately dehumanizing the others further intensified the \nothering.170 John Hagan and Wenona Rymond-Richmond recognized that “[i]t was when the \nimposed meaning of race by others became more starkly binary and stigmatic, separating ‘us’ from \n‘them’, that genocide could begin. When President al-Bashir [of Sudan] collectively identified the \nselected groups as ‘Zourga’, he opened a door to stigmatization and violence.”171\nIn sum, the Darfur Commission applied an objectified subjective approach and considered the \nprocess of othering. Most importantly, the Commission acknowledged the concept of imagined \nidentities as a basis to define the protected groups of genocide. It thereby took a giant leap in \ndefining the victim groups and translated the process of othering into a valid legal consideration. \nIn doing so, the Commission recognized the importance of social processes, irrespective of their \nobjective recognition. Genocide is precisely about the creation of identities, the stigmatization and \ndehumanization of the victim group, defined by the perpetrator only. In acknowledging the legal \nimportance of social constructs, the Darfur Commission provided for a legally sound definition of, \namongst others, the racial group. Whether the racial group has an objective existence is, according \nto this innovative approach, not important, as long as the perpetrator perceives the group as racially \ndistinct from his own and treats it inferiorly, with the ultimate aim of destroying it.\nICC Jurisprudence\nIn March 2005, the UN Security Council referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC Prosecutor \nbecause it continued to constitute a threat to international peace and security.172 The referral was \nto a large extent based on the findings of the Darfur Commission. Subsequently, the Prosecutor \nopened an investigation against the sitting President of Sudan and Commander-in-Chief of the \nSudanese Armed Forces, Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, and issued two arrest warrants in 2009 \n167 Nersessian, Genocide and Political Groups, 32.\n168 Darfur Report, para. 499 (emphasis in original). \n169 Ibid., para. 510.\n170 Ibid., para. 511.\n171 John Hagan and Wenona Rymond-Richmond, Darfur and the Crime of Genocide (Cambridge: Cambridge University \nPress, 2009), xxii (emphasis added).\n172 UN Doc.

The judges discussed whether the three tribes were \ndistinct ethnicities, which was answered affirmatively “as there are reasonable grounds to believe \nthat each of the groups… has its own language, its own tribal customs and its own traditional \nlinks to its lands”.175 With reference to the ICJ judgment on the Case Concerning the Application of \nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. \nSerbia and Montenegro) of 26 February 2007, the majority judges refrained from further exploring \nthe issue of “whether a wholly objective (based on anthropological considerations), a wholly \nsubjective (based only upon the perception of the perpetrators), or a combined objective/subjective \napproach”176 should be adopted, because they considered it unnecessary to further explore this \nissue for the purpose of the decision.177\nDespite the lack of clarification by the majority, the dissenting opinion by Judge Ušacka \npromises further debate about the concept and contours of protected groups.178 Referring to the \njurisprudence by the ad hoc tribunals, she noted that subjective criteria, like the stigmatization of \nthe group by the perpetrators, as well as objective criteria, like the particulars of a given social or \nhistorical context, had to be considered in the definition of the protected groups of genocide.179 Judge \nUšacka dissented in the classification of the targeted groups as three distinct ethnicities. Instead, \nshe suggested to define the protected group as a single ethnic group of the “African tribes”, since \nall three groups were a “perceived unitary entity, which is in turn comprised of smaller groups, \nincluding the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa”.180 It is interesting that Judge Ušacka defines the victim \ngroups as tribes, while the Darfur Commission determined that tribes were not a protected group \nof the crime of genocide, unless they also constituted a distinct racial, national, ethnical or religious \ngroup.181 However, Judge Ušacka’s classification coheres with the International Law Commission \n(ILC) and its Draft Code of Crimes of 1996, according to which genocide covered acts committed \nagainst members of a tribal group.182 Of significance to the discussion on imagined identities is the \nfact that the majority in the Omar Al-Bashir decision recognized the different approaches of defining \nthe protected groups of genocide, but did not want to position itself, whereas Judge Ušacka clearly \nrelied on perception and thereby a wholly subjective approach.\nRecent jurisdiction by the ICC reveals a continued trend of relying on perception rather \nthan objective, factual realities. In the Bosco Ntaganda case, which dealt with war crimes rather \nthan genocide, the ICC repeatedly mentioned the notion of perception. For example, it referred \nto victims “perceived to be non-Itema”,183 “those perceived to be non-originaires”184 or an attack \n173 Following an appeal by the Prosecutor against the decision by the Pre-Trial Chamber I not to include genocide into the \nfirst warrant of arrest, genocide was included into the counts and a second arrest warrant issued.

The \nmajority of judgments by the ad hoc tribunals favored a subjective approach based on the perception \nof the perpetrator, with due consideration of objective elements.189 These objective elements, \nhowever, remain undefined.\nRecent jurisprudence suggests a trend of describing a racial group as a social construct, thus \ngradually abolishing contentious objective attributes.190 This development should be welcomed \nbecause it coheres with the genocidal dynamics. A perpetrator singles out for destruction a group \nthat he considers to be different and inferior from his own. Whether the victim group is objectively \ndifferent from the perpetrator is insignificant, as long as he perceives it to be. In addition, a \nsubjective approach to race reflects the contemporary notion of the concept as a social construct or \nan imagined identity.\nNevertheless, a subjective approach that predominantly draws on the perception of the \nperpetrator, will not satisfactorily define the victim group. With an exclusive reliance on \nthe perpetrator’s perception, virtually any kind of group, imaginary or real, could become \na target of genocide. International criminal law cannot permit the crime to be determined \nby the perpetrator alone, because the law was intended to exclusively protect the national, \nreligious, ethnic and racial groups.191 The perception of differentness, upon which the subjective \napproach is built, has therefore to be restricted to the four groups in order to accord with \nthe principle of legality.\nThe combination of an objective and a subjective perpetrator-based approach will not lead \nto a coherent result either. In Brđanin, the ICTY took precisely such a mixed approach, which \nis unsatisfactory because it does not disclose what objective elements are required for the legal \ndefinition of the protected group.192 The legal certainty and foreseeability are not strengthened \nby such an undefined approach. The weakness of this mixed approach can be demonstrated \nby a hypothetical example: If the definition of the protected groups is left to the fantasy of the \nperpetrator, then he could – theoretically – perceive women as a different group and single them \nout for destruction. These women are also an objective group, into which they were born and to \nwhich they have an irreversible chromosomal membership. If a racial group is defined as a group \nthat is perceived as being different from another group, should women be classified as a different \n185 Ibid., para. 20.\n186 Lüders, Die Strafbarkeit von Völkermord, 55.\n187 Carola Lingaas, “The Elephant in the Room: The Uneasy Task of Defining Race in International Criminal Law,” \nInternational Criminal Law Review 15 (2015), 509-511.\n188 Ibid.\n189 Ibid., with a comprehensive overview and graphic illustration of all relevant cases.

This is obviously not the object and \npurpose of the genocide provisions.\nSince apparently neither the objective nor the subjective approach nor a combination of both \nwill result in a satisfactory definition a racial group, perhaps the theory of imagined identities \nwill. The following conclusion will reveal that the theory of imagined identities can clear up the \nambiguities and legal uncertainties.\nConclusion\nInternational criminal jurisprudence increasingly acknowledges that collective identities are social \nconstructs, so-called imagined identities that entirely depend on variable perceptions and not on \nfacts.193 The four protected groups do not necessarily have to be objectively verifiable, but moreover \ndepend on the perception of their differentness. This recognition should lead the legal community \nto accommodate for collective identities in general and race in particular. As suggested above, a \npurely subjective approach that builds on the perpetrator’s perception and fantasy violates the \nprinciple of legality. According to that principle, criminal provisions have to be as specific and \nclear as possible in order to allow the perpetrator to foresee the consequences of his behavior and \nenable a court to pass judgments in a provable and consistent way. An expansion of the protected \ngroups to include any subjectively perceived victim group would not pass the scrutiny of a court. \nHowever, the theory of imagined identities accommodates for the principles of foreseeability and \nspecificity. Over the course of time, any initially subjective and imagined differences between the \ngroups become solidified, effective and real, thereby providing the courts with the objectivity \nrequired in order to determine the victim groups of genocide.\nBy relying foremost on the perpetrator’s perception of the victim group, the subjective \napproach also accommodates for contemporary views on race. Race is a social construct. There is \nno objective foundation for race, and an objective approach to determining the racial victim group \nin the crime of genocide is particularly problematic. As such, the perpetrator’s perception of the \nvictims’ membership to a racial group becomes determinative for their protection from genocide. \nIf the perpetrator perceives the victims as members of a distinct racial group, they are granted \nprotection by the Genocide Convention.\nThe Darfur Commission’s objectified subjective approach to defining the protected groups \nof genocide was innovative and ground-breaking. It relied on Benedict Anderson’s theory of \nimagined communities, which was extrapolated into a theory of imagined identities, based on the \nvictim’s perceived or actual membership to one of the four protected group of genocide. In the \ntheory of imagined identity, the victims’ identification and group membership are determined by \ntheir effectiveness and operationability; as such they are treated as objective and real. For future \ncriminal cases, in which the determination of a racial group is an issue, the respective court should \nnot hesitate to apply the theory of imagined identities. It is a novel, contemporary and legally \nsound approach that allows courts to better tackle a difficult and sensitive topic: the issue of group \nmembership and in particular race. The theory of imagined identity enables the identification of \nthe racial group in that the group gains social and legal relevance once it is treated as real. In other \nwords, if the perpetrator perceives his victims as members of a distinct racial group and treats \nthem as such, namely by inferiorating and stigmatizing, the group acquires objectivity. Despite \ntheir imagined identity, the members of the racial victim group acquire an objectified existence by \nbeing treated as real.\nUltimately, the existence of a victim group is an issue of evidence: the prosecution would \nhave to prove the perpetrator’s perception rather than the objective existence of the group. Race is \nthereby removed from the objective elements of the crime, the acts reus. This solution is coherent \nwith the principle of legality, whereby courts may not create a new criminal offence, but can adapt \nprovisions to changing social conditions, such as broadening the actus reus.194 This is in essence the \nconclusion of the ICTR Muhimana trial judgment, according to which\n193 Verdirame, “The Genocide Definition”, 592.\n194 Antonio Cassese, Cassese’s International Criminal Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 32.\n', 'Lingaas\n©2016     Genocide Studies and Prevention 10, no. 1 http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1911-9933.10.1.1377\n102\n[t]he Prosecution also has the burden of proving either that the victim belongs to the targeted \nethnic, racial, national, or religious group or that the perpetrator of the crime believed that \nthe victim belonged to the group.195\nMuhimana thus gives the prosecution an alternative between proving the objective existence of a \nracial group, which would not be feasible, or the proof of the perpetrator’s belief that the victim \nwas member of such a group. In effect, it would result in releasing the racial group from the actus \nreus and fully including it into the mental elements, the mens rea.\nThe prosecution is thereby tasked to prove the perpetrator’s intent to commit a genocidal \nact as well as the special intent to destroy a group. The protected group of genocide itself is \nalso added to the prosecutorial burden. This might seem an unachievable task. However, \nthe perpetrator’s perception of the victim group will inevitably manifest itself in his behavior. \nAs has been demonstrated above, the othering of the victim group becomes observable in any \npre-genocidal process. The perpetrator’s behavior becomes the key to determining the othering \nand his understanding of the victim group. The behavior becomes apparent in posters, books, \npamphlets, but also radio broadcasts, personal statements, correspondence and the like. If this \nbehavior is characterized by othering, namely the dehumanization of the victims, there is a clear \nand unequivocal indication of his perception of the group and the ensuing genocidal intent. The \nperpetrator’s behavior is observable and will provide the foundation for a legal classification of the \nvictim group. The solution lies in the mind of the perpetrator and in the way that he perceives the \nvictim group. The legal definition of the national, racial, ethnical and religious group in the crime \nof genocide has to be seen through the eyes of the perpetrator.\nBibliography\nAkhavan, Payam.
