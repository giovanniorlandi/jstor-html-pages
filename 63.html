The house of\ncommons, immediately after the vote\nwas taken approving "the reply to the\nking\'s speech from the throne, which\nmeant ratification of the treaty, recessed\nuntil Monday to await action\non the treaty by the Dail Eireann,\nwhich is deliberating in Dublin.\nThe Ulsterites and "die hards"\nfought bitterly to the end in a last\ndesperate attempt to turn the tide\nwhich it was clearly seen from the\nfirst would overwhelm them. Charges\nof broken pledges were hurled at both\nPrime Minister Lloyd George and\nAusten Chamberlain, government\nlender in the house of commons. Major\nRobert O\'Neill, speaking: of the\nNorthern parliament, and other Ulsterites\nemphasized that the prevision\nof the treaty relating to the\nappointment of a boundary commission\nto draw the line between north\nand south Ireland in case Ulster decided\nto remain aloof from the treaty\nwas inserted without the consent of\nUlster.\nIn the house of lords the vote was\n1GG to 47; in the house of commons\nit was 401 to 58.\nThere seemed to be no doubt in\nparliamentary circles tonight that the\napproval of the treaty by Andrew\nBonar Law and the fact that the\nhouse of lords gave its sanction to it\nwould influence the Ulster extremists\nand the hope was expresed that at\nanother meeting of Mr. Lloyd George\nand Sir James Craig, which is expected\nto take place in tne near future, a\nnew face will be put in things.\nTruck Loan Via Parcel Post\nk\nCarolina Remedies Co. today shipped\na solid Reo truck load of their\nremedies by parcel post. The truck\nloaded full passed from the building\non me corner 01 cmurcn ana mam\nstreet up Main street to the postoffice\nthis morning. The Times man, upon\nlearning of this shipment, visited the\n\' plant of the company and found that\non Monday another truck load would\ngo into the postoffice for shipment.\nThese parcel post shipments are cases\nin which the concern is shipping a\nsingle carton to various concerns\nthroughout the country. These freight\nshipments are much heavier. But it\nwas an eye-opener to see such quantities\ngoing out by mail. The building\nrecently purchased^by the^Caroplant\nisbeing^nstalled. ^The company\ncontemplates adding a third\nstory to the already large building in\nthe near future. _ \'\nLand Sale\nState of South Carolina,\nUnion County.\nCourt of Common Pleas.\nPeoples Building and Loan Association,\nPlaintiff,\nvs.\nmajor oanuers, ueienaani.\nPursuant to a Decree of the Court\naforesaid, heretofore made in the\nabove stated case, I will sell before\nthe Court,House door in Union, S.

DECEMBER 17, 1921.\nThere was a distinct note of pessimism\nat the Chamber of Commerce\nThursday evening. We do not believe\nthe pessimism was warranted.\nAt the beginning of the year the di\nrectors met and agreed upon a most\ndrastic retrenchment. They thought\nthat to keep open shop for this yeai\nwould be a real triumph. They went\n: > work and got the money to do this\nand to pay a thousand or two dollar:\ndebts. We do not feel alarmed ovoi\nthe present slow moving condition int<\nwhich the organization has fallen. I\nwas what we all foresaw. This i:\nthe very time that the organizatioi\ncould get in some great work. Tlv\nforced necessity for changing ou\nmethods of farming offers n tine fieh\nfor Chamber of Commerce worh\nWhile the note of pessimism wa\nbeing sounded in the meeting Thurs\nday night we could not help remcm\nbering a parallel case, that- of :\npreacher who frays alive the fev\nfaithful ones for the sins of omissioi\ncommitted by the many. We sin\neerely hope the Chamber of Com\nmerce will meet with the suppor\nasked for next year. The small sun\nof $1500 certainly should not caus<\nthe movement to cease to function.\nWe are glad to note that Snrdi:\nFarm held quite a successful sale thi\nweek. Owing to the general slump in\naln^s the concern has had pretty\nrough sledding, we judge. B it the\ncstanlishmenl of this particular enterprise,\nnow that we have the boll weevil\nand the slump in cotton prices to\nontend with, is a great thing for\nUnion County. It fits into the period\nof reconstruction perfectly. Scrub\nhops, ten thousand of them, would not\nhelp Union County to become adjusted\nto a new order of things. Rut\npure bred stock scattered throughout\nthe county is a wonderful help in the\ncrisis that has come.

There\nare other good breeds to be had. And\nsome few farmefs have other breeds\nsuch as Poland China and Berkshire.\n| But Sardis Farm has done more to\nmake farmers believe in pure bred\nhogs and has actually scattered more\npure bred hogs over the county during\nthe few years that it has lived\nthan all other agencies combined had\ndone up to that time. The present situation\nis a time when this entei prise\ncomes to the rescue, and one is able\nto see its value. The business men\nof the county would do themselves a\ngood turn as well as serve others if\nthey would give this institution financial\nand moral support. It should Insupported,\nfor it furnishes one of the\nbest means yet devised to fight the I\nboll weevil. It is, at this particular\'\ntime, of inestimable value to Union\nCounty. It was hard for us to realize\nthis when cotton was 40 cents and\n, the boll weevil had not yet arrived.\nHog raising is one of the greatest\naids yet devised to fight boll weevil.\nBut it takes pure bred hogs to do the\nwork. Sardis Farm furnishes that\nkind. You can, for a few paltry dollars\nbuy a pig entitled to rcgisira\'\ntion. It would be a good thing i;\nmany farmers throughout the county\nwould during the next few weeks go\nIto the management of Sardis Kami\nand purchase one or more of these\n. fino pigs.
