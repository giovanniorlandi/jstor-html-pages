Clinton of San Francisco,, who is physician to several boys’, schools, says: ”1 am often called in to, prescribe for boys for palpitation of, the heart. In nine cases out of ten, this is caused by the cigarette habit., Cigarette smoking gives boys en, largement of the heart, and it sends, them into consumption, and it sends, them to the insane asylum.”, President David Starr Jordan, of j, I.eland Stanford University says:, "They (cigarette smokers) rarely i, make failures in after life because, they do not have any after life. The, boy who begins smoking before his, fifteenth year never enters the life, of the world. When the other boys, are taking hold of the world\'s work,, he is concerned with the sexton and, undertaker.”, At Peoria, 111., 208 boys out of 412, applicants for the navy were reject, ed, mostly on account of weak hearts., Cigarette smoking was the cause of, most of the weak hearts., The effect on the heart has been, studied with the sphygmograph, an, instrument which records the heart, action graphically. This shows that, at first the heart action is stimulated, and beats stronger, but in about 15, minutes the narcotic effect has be, come apparent and the action is slow, ed again. The permanent effect is to, decrease courage, activity and ag, gressiveness. It is significant that, traces of the heart of a woman on, the verge of nervous prostration and, of a heart weakened by long smok, ing are identical in character., An article in the New York School, Journal by P.
