Mai\nsonette <\nBy a more chance no one except\nFlorence the elevator boy was at\nhand when Miss cord ella Byrne called\nto Inspect the fifth floor back which\nwas advertised for rent She took it\nand her furniture camp the next morn\nlag when Mr Moriarjty was again ab\nsent Miss Byrne was about 55 20 years oi\nage slender of middle stature and\ndressed habitually In black or dark\nblue How anyone who looked at her\nmelting blue eyes her sensitive pout\ning mouth and her pale complexion\nenriched by her auburn hair could\nhave found reason to doubt her good\nness few men would be able to say\nAmong her belongings was an up\nright piano and she and it combined\naltered the temper ot the people In\nthe Moriarty Maisonette with a sud\ndenness and to a degree which was\nastonishing This was because she\nand it either knew but one tune or\nat any rate played but one This\nwas a dainty rippling trifle by Pader\newskl On the first afternoon and\nevening Miss Byrne played the Pader\newskl peasant Bailee over some dozen\ntimes Now when the exquisite roll\nIckIng merry melodic current flowed\nthrough the wall to the fifth floot\nfront through the floor to the fourth\nstory suites and through the ceiling\nto the sixth storys tiny homes the\nstar tenant sat entranced his silken\nrobed better half loaned forward\nplucking her youngest from the foot\nto bid it listen to the pooty moo\nzlcks Upstairs and downstairs the\ndelighted tenants blessed the day that\nMoriartys builders scamped theh\nwork leaving the house so like a col\nander that Cordelia Byrne could plaj\nthem all into the seventh heaven oi\ndelight with Paderewskls peasan\ndanceso suited to the joyous tern\nperament of the Irish audience and tc\ntheir pretty taste in music\nMiss Byrne was taken into the\nwarmest corners of the hearts in the\nMaisonette on that night She could\nalmost have demanded Instant mem\nbership in the Bloomingdale Bowling\nclub to which nearly all the tenants\nbelonged\nThat was as we recollect It on a\nFriday night The following Wednes\nday found everything unchanged ex\ncept the temper of Moriartys tenants\nThat night the Pinochle club atom\nposed of six of the male tenant 01\nthe Maisonette mot In Mr MahQneys\napartments Five of the mombfr\nwere on hand promptly and waited\nfor Mr Morlarty the sixth to arrive\nMiss Cordelia Byrne in the rear suite\non the same fttipr with tho Mahoneys\nregaled the club members with that\nchoice morceaU of Paderewskis to\nwhich we have referred and with\nwhich all the men and women in the\nMaisonette had for somo time been\nfamiliar\nThe plot was afoot The Innocent\nproprietor of what he once boasted as\nbeing the happiest bunch of homes on\ntho Island was to be trapped when he\ncame for a nights enjoyment by a\nrebellious band of tenants who had\nsworn that either they Miss Byrne 01\nher piano must leave the house on the\nfirst of the Incoming month\nMeanwhile Miss Byrne finished the\none hundred and sixtyeighth rendi\ntion of the dainty peasant dance and\nClosing the piano moved across the\nneat and cozy parlor faintly perfume\nwith a delicate odor of lilac to the lit\ntie writing table and penned a note\nto her slater We may read over hoi\nshoulders as she writes\nThere la nothing to write only 1\nknow you aro wondering It Is win\nall or lose all with me I may

tune and Its a Qalle of\ngood riddance to bad rubbish with\nthe IQ of us\nHold on now said Moriarty\nwhats the use of such talk between\nfriends Leave it to me Ill go and\nsee the girl and give her the K1 bosh\nall right Whats her and her planner\nto me where the likes 0 you old\nfriends is concerned\nWhen Miss Byrne opened the door\nto receive his visit she greeted him\np\nwith such evident though guarded and\nblushing pride as would have flat\ntered any man alive As she set out a\nSat opposite him\nchair for him she said that he was\nthe first visitor whp had honored her\napartments and that she thought It\nmost kind of him to pay her this high\ncompliment She was not so over\ncome with delight but that she be\nthought herself to open the door Into\ntho hall and leave it open during his\nvisit Then she sat opposite to him\nat a well chosen distance suggestive\nneither of familiarity nor prudish de\ncorum And all the time she let flow\na current of the most shrewdly chosen\nremarks the purpose of which was\nveiled by great maidenly simplicity\nand modesty\nSometimes a very obscuro little\nwoman reveals the genius of a great\ndiplomat in ways such as these\n7 While Mr Morlarty was yielding to\nft sense of shame for having planned\nrudeness to so pretty a little lady he\ngradually became interested in the\nmatter as well as the manner gf her\nspeech He learned of her loneliness\nher piety her domesticity and of hoi\nvery respectable family connections\nHis sympathy was first aroused then\nhis admiration His gallantry yielded\nto devotion He was netted like a\nmoth and as the wings of his freedom\nwere rumpled in the meshes of her\nattractions he felt the danger that\nthreatened But he made no effort to\nescape He was a very willing cap\ntive\nBut how rudo I have been Miss\nByrne presently exclaimed I have\nnot asked whether you had any special\nerrand Or did you really q > me to\noffer mo the first kind word 1 I have\nhad in my new home\nI heard your planner the clumsy\nfollow began in reply andand\nHe pretty nearly blurted out the truth\nOh did you like the little piece I\nwas playing\nTwas the most angelic town ever\nI heard in my life Moriarty an\nswered recovering his native tact\nThen do let me play it for you\nOh I dont mind a bit\nShe ended the performance with a\nmedley of Irish airs played with a\nfair amount of cleverness She Wall\nfinished And the last string which\nheld Moriartys heart in place was\nloosened both that organ and his\nbrain went afloat upon the troubled\nsea of love\nWhen at length he bid Miss Byrne\ngood night she dropped a hint that\nher pious duties at St Catharines\nwere Interesting her to such a degree\nthat she was lorlously thinking of\ntaking tho veil and devoting herself\nto tho church The roguo said this so\nsoberly with such half expressed sug\ngestion of earnestness and doubt of\nher worthiness that she put Moriarty\nin an agony lest sho should take holy\nvows before It would bo lit time for\nhim to propose marriage to her\nFacing his friends at the card table\nbC mo what later he was unable to con\nceal his scorn for their unmanly be\nhavior of an hour
