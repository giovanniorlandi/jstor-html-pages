X .\nHîilUJARV\n7;\nCOUN\'\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS\nÆAT; AT JUDITH GAP OR HARLOWTON?\nTAKE YOUR PENCIL OUT AND DO A\nLITTLE FIGURING ON COUNTY DIVISION\nWhatever real cause those who are |\nopposing county division may have\nthe assumed one is that it will be a\nburden in expense in the way ol\' in\ncreased taxation that ttie new settler\ncsuuot afford to assume. At present\nthis is the main cry of the people of\nlledgesvilie. Let us see where this\nincreased cost will be.\nThe present county and state levy\nfor Meagher county in 1912 is 20.3\nmills, about a mill and a half higher\nthan the levy of 1911, which levy was\nmbout a mill and a half higher than\nin 1910. And what has happened\nalong this line will continue to hap\npen as the county keeps on passing to\na lower class each year witli higher\nsalaries, and the yearly expense of\nadding about $ 10,000 a year from the\ngeneral fund to build additions to the\ncourt h o u s e at White Sulphur\nSprings.\nit is acknowledged that if Wheat\nlaud county is formed it will have an\nassessed valuation of uo less than\n94,500,000. An 18 mill levy will give\nus$8l,000 a year in taxes. Out of\nthis the state will get $11,250 on a\nS-12 mill levy. The salaries of offi\ncers and deputies for a seventh class\ncounty will amount to no more than\nf 10,000. The cost of organizing the\nnew county, transcribing records,\nblank books, office iix lures and print\ning of blanks and books will not be\nover $14,000. The court expenses\ncan only be estimated, but should\nnot exceed $ 12 ,non a year, and the\nprobabilities are it will be much less.\nAfter deducting these amounts there\nwill be left for roads and bridges and\nincidental expenses the sum of $27,\n?5o. At least $20,000 of this can be\nused in making roads each year.\nIn becoming segregated from\nMeagher county we will have to\n■trike a balance sheet. After deduct\ning our share of indebtedness we will\nreceive our proportion of the cash on\nhand, which will be about $35,000.\nWe cau do either of two things with\nthis money: Use it to build a court\nThe Quality\nSPRING\nIs not here yet and you\nwill need warm clothing\nfor some time.\nWe are still making a\nreduction on all our win\nter goods.\nBeers & Haynes\nThe Pioneer Merchants\nhouse, which will erect a building\nample to meet the needs of the new\'\ncounty for many years to come, or j\nput it out in the local banks at 3 per I\ncent interest, and later on apply the\nprincipal and accuminitiated interest\ntowards paying for a court house.\nAt the\'same valuation as at pres\nent the levy should never be over 18\nmills for county and state purposes,\nand ou account of the compactness\nand smallness of the county, the levy\nshould he reduced from year to year\nas the assessed valuation of the\ncounty\'s property iucrease, as it\nsurely will when the railroad lauds\nare sold and improved and Ute towns\ngrow\'.\nA great deal of care must be exer\ncised in selecting the three county\ncommissioners of Wheatland county.\nThey should be men of exceptional\nbusiness ability, strict integrity and\nsturdy honesty, men who cau not\nlie swerved from their plain path of\nduty in keeping expenses down by\ntheclamor of designing grafters, It\nis almost wholly up to the commis\nsioners as to the amount of the ex\npense of running the new county, and\nthey must be meu who are absolutely\nfree from the suspicion of having an\nitching to graft or in any way ac\nceptable to wrong influences.\nWith these kind of commissioners\nthe taxes in the new county will be\nconsiderably less the first year of the\norganization of Wheatland county\nthan they are at present, and each\nyear thereafter they should be mat\nerially reduced.\nCongregational Church Notice.\nSuuday Feb. 9th preaching services\nwill be held in the evening at 7:30\no\'clock.

J. Giltinan was in the city Sun\nday on his way to White Sulphur\nSprings to visit his old friend C\'. W.\nCook and meet his many acquain\ntances at the county seat.\nHarry came to Montana thirty\nyears ago and early settled iu tlie\nSmith Kiver valley where lie was for\na long time engaged in tlie sheep\nraising business. Five or six years\nago his attention was called to the\nMoule ranch on Careless creek, one\nof tlie biggest holdings south of tlie\nSnowy mountains, and Mr. Moule\nbeing one of tlie largest sheep raisers\nin this section. Mr. Giltinan made a\npersonal inspection of tlie property\nbut was not favorably impressed\nwith it until he visited ttie headwat\ners of Careless and Swimming Wo\nman creeks, two streams of about\nequal volume that come out of tlie\nSnowy mountains about two miles\napart, and from both of which\nstreams Mr. Moule had valuable\nwater rights for the use of his sheep\nand for irrigation purposes.\nHis examination of tlie headwaters\nof the Swimmiutr Woman revealed to\nhim a marvelous natural formation,\nwhich, witli some work of man,\nwould make a reservoir that would\nconserve enough water to irrigate\nthousands of acres of rich farming\nlands in the territory drained liy that\nstream. Tlie same was true of tlie\nheadwaters of Careless creek. Im\nmediately grasping the possibilities\nof these two streams from an irriga\ntion standpoint, Mr. Giltinan at once\ndecided to purchase the Moule ranch.\nSwimming Woman creek comes\nout of tlie mountains through a solid\nformation of rock that rises almost\nperpendicularly to a height of over\n200 feet. Tlie opening at tlie base is\nabout 200 feet wide, Bv tilling this\ngap witli concrete to a distance of 200\nfeet high, the natural basin iu tlie\nmountains would hold sufficient wat\ner to irrigate all the lands for\nmiles and miles on both sides of tlie\nstream, besides forming a water pow\ner of untold value. About the same\nnatural conditions exist at tlie open\ning through which Careless creek\nflows from tlie mountains.\nSeveral years ago Air. Giltinan\niiad a preliminary survey made o\nthese two openings and tlie civil en\ngineer estimated the cost of the con\ncrete work at about $85,000 for each\nstream.

Besides furnishing enough\nwater to irrigate thousands of acres\nof fertile lands, a water power could\nlie developed from both these dams\nto furnish enough electricity to elec\ntrify the Great Northern railway\nfrom Great Falls to Billings, run\nelectric lines throughout all the\ncountry south of tlie mountains, fur\nnisli every fanner with cheap power\nand lights besides the towns of Hed\ngesville, Nihilt and Judith Gap.\nWith irrigation the vast country\nsouth of tlie mountains, would be\ntransferred into lields of sugar beets\nand alfalfa, whicli would mean fac\ntories at the towns along tlie Great\nNorthern in this territory, and the\nlands would be as valuable as those\naround Billings, which are held from\n$150 to $250 an acre.\nMr. Giltinan has given this propo\nsition of water {tower and irrigation\nfrom these two streams careful\nthought for several years, and lie is\nthoroughly convinced that tlie possi\nbilities as aboye enumerated arc not\nirredt scent dreams, and that before\nthree years time some company will\nbe in control of tlie proposition with\nsufficient capital to develop tlie pow\ner and water to its fullest capabili\nties, and that will mean prosperity to\nills town of lledgesvilie and every\nfanner living south of tlie Snowy\nmountains.\nAnd Mr. Giltinan cau couut on tlie\nhelp of Judith Gap to push the pro\nject along, as anything that will help\nlledgesvilie is bound to help this\ntown.\nM.

To start with hr has\nto rent a mansion befit i mg his oihce\nas iiis oilicial residence, and to do\nthis it will rci|tiire tin* expenditure\nof at least one-half his salary pet\nyear. lie is expected to crtv* enter\ntainments during his term of oiiice\nthat will consume tin* remainder of\nhis salary.

He left the\noGice it poor man. And no head of\nany state did more to advance the\nmaterial interests of this commou\nweallli than di-l tiovernnr Norris.\nIn bis trips throughout the east on\nthe governor\'s special and at the na\ntional convention of governors, lie at\ntracted more attention to the irreal\npossibilities of Iiis slate, both to\ncapital and those who were seeking\nfarm homes, than all the advertising\ntlie state has done through the chan\nnels of commercial bodies, railroads\nand new spapers combined. A n d\nduring all this time the state made\nhim pay rent for his ollh-ia! residence.\n«Jovernor Stewart is a poor man.\nlie w ill tie expected to do as well as\nhis predecessor in entertaining and\nattracting capital and settlers, and j\nunless the present legislature buys a\nhome which will he known as the\ngovernor\'s mansion and furnish and |\nmaintain it. he will quit the office j\ninttelt poorer thpn when he began Iiis ,\nterm.\nGovernor Toole, the lirst governor i\nof the state, was sufficiently wealthy i\nto erect a magnificent mansion and i\nmaintain it during Iiis several terms !\nwithout any cost to the state.

It will mean a steady j\nmonthly cash income to all who want !\nto engage in milking cows, raising !\npoultry and hogs. At the present j\ntime there are over 200 cows being I\nmilked in this immediate territory j\nand it is a hard matter to lind a\nmarket for hatter. The same is true j\nof poultry and eggs, while there is j\nvery little market for hogs unless by\nthe earload, and very few individual :\n: farmers care to go into hog raising >\n■ on a large scale. With the establish- j\nnient of a creamery, more Imgs will \'\nlie raised, and tin* creamery can lind\nÎ a ready outlet for hogs where an in\ndividual cannot. The creamery pro- j\n. position can he enlarged to such an\nextent as to allow the marketing of\nall stiill raised on tlie farm.\nOf course, we can go on raising j\nw heat, three crops in live ysars, and [\nI to he able to pay the interest cm the !\n! mortgages, hut the surest way to pay !\ntin* interest and priueipal is to diver\nsify. With the cow on the farm and\na ready market for the cream, tin*\n: farmer will not he compelled to ask :\niiis grocoryman fur credit. he can pay |\ncash fur all his necessities, pay tlie\nmortgage off before it is due, and\nhave money in the bun\'« at all times.\nAnd this is tin* proper time to dis\ncuss tin* project of a creamery. Those\nwho intend to put in sitting crops,\ncan arrange to make them forage\ncrops and feed them on tlie farm. If\nthe proper interest is displayed by\ntin* farmers at the meeting on the tôt h\nof February, there will he a way\nfound whereby those who are not\nliiiaiieiallv able to liny good milk\ncows at tIiis time to secure same,\nand get into the prosperity game\nright.\nIt must lie remembered that tin*\nrailroads running through Wheat\nland county, t m it improvements, and\nthcN.

There is opportunity {pr long\ncontinued study of blood lines; there\nare mouths and years of anxious wait\nlug to see the results of the union of\ncertain families; there are moments of\ndisappointment wheu an animal fails\nto develop as well as expected. Hut\ngreatest of all is the joy of success\nwhen the breeder\'s efforts an* crowned\nwith au animal a little nearer perfec\ntion than has lx*eu produced before.\nThe man who can see such an animal\nmarch out of a crowded shmv ring\nwith the purple ribbon without a feel\ning that at least in n measure he 1ms\nachieved success has ambitions that\nare indeed hard to satisfy. The pure\nbred business has some pitfalls, but to\nthe man who enters it with good judg\nment and au ambition to succeed it\noffers financial returns that can he ex\nceeded in few other occupations.\nTo the young man starting without\ncapital the farm offers unequaled op\nportunities. The young man with a\n| few- friends and a reputation for in\n,\ni\n!\n,\nI\na j\n;\n;\ndustry and honesty finds it easy to\nrent a farm and borrow enough capi\ntal to equip it. There is a risk to run.\nof course. But wluit is a risk to a\nyoung man with strength and ambi\ntion? Well considered risks are essen\ntial to success in almost aa.v line, and\nto the young farmer they are an incen\ntive to greater effort. Now that prices\nof farm products have reached a prof\nitable level paying off the debt is a\nmatter of but a few years. Having tlie\nfarm itself is by no means impossible,\neven in the most fertile sections of the\ncorn belt.\nHundreds of farmers are looking for\nmanagers for farms that vary in size\nund equipment to suit tin* fancy of\nany one. Tills line offers some of the\ngreatest opportunities to \'.la* young\nman without capital. The salaries at\nür-t may seem small as compared with\nsome of those offered iu the city, Fsit\na!!y \'hey include board and Inciden\ntals, however There is n better\nehuip-e to lay up money on the farm\nat Sr.il a month than in the < • i t y at\ntw ice that amount. For the man who\ncan "make good" the first year\'s salary\nIs hardly an indication of what is to\nfollow Most landowners are willing\nto advance the salary as fast as the\nmanager shows ids ability. Heiter yet.\nthey are willing to intrust more of the\nresponsibility to ids hands and to give\nhim more capital, so that he can\nachieve greater results, in most cases\nafter a man has shown what he is\nwotth it is easy for him to get a share\nof the net profits in addition to his\nsalary In many cases it is easy to got\nin on a partnership basis In either\ncast* the manager is as independent a*\nif lit- « w in d the farin. and tin* chance*\nfor tmnucia! success are nearly as\ngreat.\nTlie great advantage of a position of\nthis t.i: d or. in fact, of any kind of\nTerm work is that there are so many\nchances to invest money as fast as it\nis made.\n\'1 he man on the farm has a dozen\nplaces to invest every dollar. This in\nitself is a big incentive to saving, and\nsaving means prosperity for both the\nindividual and the nation. The invest\nment which offers the greatest return*\nts farm land.

The\nyoung farmer Is uot entering an over\ncrowded calling where he must com\nbine with his fellows and lioost prices\nunnaturally In order to make a bare\nliving. In agriculture there are room\nand opportunity for all. The country\nis throbbing with the vitality of a new\nawakened life. The password is ambi\ntion, and the reward Is success.\nIt is not the call of money alone that\nIs turning the ambitious young man\nto the farm. .A calling time can offer\nno reward but a financial one Is scarce\nly worthy of the name. The chief call\nof the city has been the call of the dol\nlar combined with the call of the\ncrowd. Better roads and it denser pop\nulation have enabled the country to\noffer a social life which is superior to\nthat of the city. Higher prices and\nscientific methods have enabled it to\nduplicate the linancial rewards of the\ncity, in addition, it offers to the young\nman tlie opportunity to live the broad\nest. fullest life of which he is capable.\nIt offers bim a business be can call Ida\nown and an Independence which he\ncould gain in tlie city only after a life\ntime of toll. The greatest need of\nmost rural communities just now is\nleaders—men who can demonstrate on\ntheir own farms the possibilities of\nscientific agriculture: men who under\nstand the possibilities and the need of\na broader community life.\nTbe stories of some of the young\nmen who heeded the call of the coun\ntry and gave themselves to the devel\nopment of their community read like\nromances. A dozen years or so ago a\nlittle Massachusetts community was on\nthe dow nhill road. The nearby cities\nbad sapped it of its strength and vig\nor. Injudicious cropping had taken\naway much of tlie fertility of the\nsoil, and the people had lost all ambi\ntion and were content to let tilings\ndrift from bad to, worse. About tills\ntime a young man, a son of one of tin*\nfarmers, graduated from an agricul\ntural college. He received a tempting\noffer from the department of agricul\nture to take up work at Washington.\nA brother in Iowa wrote him a glow\ning invitation to come to tlie fertile\nlands of tin* middle west, lie rejected\nbotli offers and went home.\nTin* most optimistic resident would\nhave laughed nt tin* idea of there be\ning any opportunity there. Hut tlie\nyoung man went to work. He did not\nlecture to tin* neighbors or advise\nthem lie merely set out to show them\nwhat the Impoverished land was ca\npable of. lie made the old farm pay.\n*nd its dilapidation changed to an air\nof prosperity. His neighbors gradually\nbegan to follow Ills methods and to\nj catch some of Ids spirit. The commit\ni ult.v started to go forward instead of\nI backward. As soon as he could spare\n! tlie time from his farm the young\nj farmer set about reorganizing tlie vil\nlage school He gave one corner of\nof\na\n»\n; -. * ■sST:*\'*:\n/ \\ «\nm\nt *\nrBKIIF.

Thea* special traîna are for\nthe purpoae *f giving the farmers in\nformation regarding th* production of\nlive stock end graine ef all kind*.\nRecently, in th* state of Iowa, th*\nRock Island railroad equipped a train\nfor the purpose of giving the farmers\ninformation as regarda to the raising\nof hogs. After this train had run\nthrough s portion of Iowa it waa tak\nen on to Nebraska, Oklahoma and\nTexas. In fact the train was rua\nthroughout the Rock Island system.\nThe exleualon department of each of\nthese states co-operated with the rail\nroad and aided In making these trips\na grand success.\nDuring the past year another trala\nwas run In a different part of the state\nof Iowa and the lectures were devoted\nto tbe improvement of the baeon hog.\nThe train was known as the "Break\nfast Bacon Special." Speakers from\nthe extension department at the Iowa\nState college did most ot the talking.\nTheir talk« were brief, concise and te\nthe point, and a large amount of in\nformation was given te the farmers\nwherever the train happened to stop.\nThere bae been considerable dis\ncussion regarding the relative merits\nof these special trains. Some people\nsay that it Is not possible for the\nfarmer to gain much information by\nlistening to a lecture upon any one\ntopic. However, we find (that these\ntrains are doing a wonderful amount\nof good. It may be true that the farm\ner may not get much information from\nlistening te one of these talks, hut he\nwill beccme enthused and If any ques\ntions come up later he will send them\nIn to people who are well versed in\nthat special type of farming.\nLast June the Northern Pacific Rail\nway company. In connection with the\nMontana Farmers\' Institute, ran a\n"Better Farming Special" across th#\nstate of Montana. This farta was\ntaken to nearly ail parts of th* coun\ntry into which the Northern Pacifie\nlines are extended. The talks were\nalong the lines of dry farming, irriga\ntion farming, live stock and diseases\nand insects. A specialist along each\none of these lines devoted bis entire\ntime to questions and giving out Infor\nmation regarding these topics.

And this is how mice gained\nthe numbers and audacity to accom\nplish such a work of ruin:\n"Nailed to his barn door was the\ncarcass of an owl which he had shot\nand\'nailed up as a warning to others\nOf Its kind. In the stomach of that\n•wl, which waa opened in the pres\nence of the stricken orchardman by\nan expert of the federal biological sur\nvey, were found the remains of nine\nBald mice. The owl. a real benefac\ntor, had been destroyed by the man\nwhose orchard he had been striving,\nwith all a gourmand\'s energy, to con\nserva.\n" \'He was a friend and a fellow\nworker and yet you killed him.\' said\nthe scientist aa he turned to the or\nchardman. \'He came here to eat the\nBald mice and to try to save your\norchard. H« was dining well and he\nwould have called his friends and\nfamily to his assistance If he had been\nleft alive. Your trees are gone and\nyou have yourself to blame for the\nlose. Hawks and owls are the orchard\nman\'s assistants and you couldn\'t do\nany better than to start a new orchard\nend start at the same time propaga\ntion houses for the growing of those\naperies of birds.\'\n"This particular instance of the\ncostliness of the warfare waged\nagainst the birds and animals which\nprey upon mica Is more striking be\ncause the loss was concentrated upon a\nsingle individual.

It is generally re\ngarded as a nuisance and of uo eco\nnomic value, for it is a strong grower,\nexceedingly prolific of seed, crowds\nout other plants, and it is not relished\nby live stock.\nSweet clover is an annual, growing\neach season from seed.

D.,\nthat is worth more than a passing no\ntice. This cow is a grade Jersey,\npicked up for about $45, and yet last\nyear the profit over the cost of her\nkeep was more than $100. She gave\n10,011 pounds of milk and 3S4.8\npounds of butter fat.\nNow this cow Is nothing extraordi\nnary, that is, she would never break\na world\'s record or do anything re\nmarkable in the publicity line, but\nthat is not what the Montana farmer\nwants. He wants a cow that, will re\nturn a maximum yield of butter fat\nfor the food that ho puts Into her and\nIn this respect this little grade Jer\nsey fills the bill. The average cow\nof the state, kept under the same con\nditions aa thla one, would yield about\n$8 profit where D. D. gives over $100,\nla there much choice between them\nfor the farmer?\nEvery cow haa to eat a certain\namount of food ip order to keep her\nalive and In a good healthy condition.\nThis is called a maintenance ration. If\na cow la fat and weighs heavily for\nher build, it will take more to main\ntain her thaa a cow that is thin, that\nIs, a cow In a lean, rigorous condition,\nthe condition that we desire in our\ndairy cows. Wo want a dairy cow to\npul all the food that she does not need\nfor maintenance Into milk, not Into a\nthick coating of fat.\nThis little Jersey is a good example\nof dairy temperament, that is, she\nia always in a loan, rigorous condi\ntion. 9he Is a cow that fulfills the\npurpose for which she is Intended—\nan economical producer of dairy\nproducts.\n! HARVESTING FLAX.\nMoat Careful Growers Bind Bundles\nfor Facility in Handling.\nVarious plans are followed in har\nvesting flax—the mower and buncher,\nthe header, the aelf-rnke reaper, and\nthe binder; the latter la used both\nwith and without twine. The preva\nlent practice in harvesting appears to\nbe to use the binder without twine,\ndropping the llax in bunches from the\nbundle carrier. This works satisfac\ntorily if rains do not come on the\nbunches of flax. Should these get\nwet, it is desirable to turn them to\nfacilitate drying out. Some of the\nmost careful growers use twine, set\nting the flax bundles In long narrow\nricks to avoid damage front wetting.\nWork is being done upon a special\nmachine for harvesting flax.\nFlax seed being in a hard pod or\nboll, it is mote difficult to separate It\nthat is the case with most small\ngrains. Threshers are equipped with\nsieves adapted to cleaning flax in ad\ndition to the adjusting sieves in gen\neral use "Usually six tows of eon\ncave teeth are required and the cylin\n! der is kepi to a high rate of speed,"\ni (Science of Successful Threshing, p.\ni 1SS).\nOne difficulty in threshiug flax Ip\nI the liber of the straw, which has a\nI tendency to wind up on the cylinder\n; and slug the machine.

For our part, the\nlogical, reasonable statements of Gen\nesis respecting tbe Flood lire a hun\ndred times more trustworthy than the\ncrude Babylonian record.\nNoah and bis family dreaded another\ndeluge. God called their attention to\nthe rainbow, assuring them that never\naguln would the whole earth be flood\ned. Because earth\'s last "ring" had\ncome down, there could not be another\ndeluge. Since tbe\nFlood, we have\nmoisture in the\nform of clouds.\nPrior to the\nFlood, tbe sun\nshone through the\nwatery envelope\nas a great ball of\nfire. Hence no\nrainbow was pos\nsible. But uow\nfine vapors in the The dove with the olive\ndirect line of the **®f\nsun\'s rays naturally cause tbe rainbow.\nAs God declares, so long as there la\na rainbow, there can never be a flood. *\nThe Tower ef Babel.\nCenturies afterward, the worldly\nwise of tbut time uudertook tbe build\ning of a great tower, anticipating an\nother deluge. Since they disregarded\nGod\'s promise. He let them manifest\ntheir folly In unavailing sweat of face.\nWhen they were wearied by tbelr her\nculean task and bad learned valuable\nlessons. God confounded tbelr lan\nguage. Separated In tongue aud inter\nest, they scattered. Gradually man\nners. customs and color of skin became\ndissimilar. Thus the various races\nwith tbelr peculiarities of temperament\nand language had their start. St. Paul\nremarks that this was premeditated on\nGod\'s part as being most favorable for\nthe outworking of Divine purposes.\nThe separation of mankind Into dif\nferent nationalities and the barriers of\nlanguage kept the peoples apart for\ncenturies. But since steam became ef\nfective for transportation, tbe commin\ngling of nations Is breaking down na\ntional barriers and favoring human co\noperation.

The first\nEpoch ended with the Flood, where\nthe present Epoch began, styled by St.\nPaul, "This present evil world." St.\nPeter says that the present w\'orld will\nbe ended by a deluge of "fire." Then\nwill follow a new "world." or order of\ntilings. "The world to come," will be\nan Epoch of Itlghteousues8. under\nMessianic supervision.\nBible students formerly understood\nSt. Peter\'s words to signify literal fire,\nto consume the physical earth and\nheavens.

Steadily\nthe competition has grown more\nfierce that is crushing the life\nand the hope of the peoples.\nBut steadily, too—and of late\neven more rapidly—hns grown\nthe hope that an escape from\nthese burdens may be found:\nthat lu some measure at least\nthe peaceful methods of settling\ndisputes among Individuals may\nobtain among the nations.\nWherever good men and women\nthe world over are longing and\npraying for the dawn of tills\ngreat day of peace their eyes\nturn first with hope and confi\ndence to the great republic of\nthe west, whose Ideals are of\npeace and Justice.
