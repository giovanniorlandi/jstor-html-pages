It is believed\nthey are here to await the arrival of\nmessengers from the insurrecto chief\nbringing tne terms upon which he will\nconsent to a cessation of hostilities.\nThat these terms must be formulated\nby the men who are in the field was\ndeclared by Alfonso Madero.\nThat the eider Madero\'s influence\nwill be strongly for peace is the state\nment of those who claim to know his\nattitude. The father of the insurrecto\nleader, it is said, has never given the\nmovement his whole hearted support,\nand would welcome the end of the war\nupon any reasonable terms.\nCouriers, who left for the insurrecto\nchief\'s camp near Chihuahua a few\ndays ago, are now believed to have\ncarried messages from the elder Made\nro, and these, it is surmised, urged\nthe son to make for peace.\nMail advices from Magdelena, So\nnora, declared the insurrectos cap\ntured three wagonloads of ammunition\nwhich were being sent from Hermosil\nlo to the federal\'garrison at TJres.

J. Russell, which in ef-\nfect was to raise the liquor license\nfee from $500 to $1000, was killed\nlast night.\nAfter the ordinance had been read\nfor the third and last time, Mr. Rus\nsell in a short address to the council\nsaid that the ordinace had been\ndrawn with the intention of treat\ning the men now in the saloon busi\nness with as much justice as pos\nsible, and to provide so that those\nwho were unable to pay the ?1000\nlicense might receive back the un\nused portion of their license money,\nthis clause conflicting with Section\n1536, Revised Laws of 1905.\nA vote was then taken which re\nsulted in seven votes against the or\ndinance to none for it, there being\ntwo aldermen absent, they being Al\nderman at Large Johnson and Alder\nman Bailey.\nA motion was then made by Al\nderman Klein, whereby further work\nin regard to drawing up a new or\ndinance be left over until the next\nmeeting, and that a committee com\nprising five aldermen be appointed\nby the chairman, to meet with the\ncity attorney this afternoon at 2\no\'clock to talk over the new meas\nure.\nAlderman Bisiar, who was presid\ning, appointed the following, Moberg,\nchairman, Crippen, Klein, Roe and\nBrown.\nA motion was then made by Alder\nman Smart and upon being seconded\nwas passed, whereby Reverend White\nof the Presbyterian church and Rev\nerend Flesher of the Methodist\nchurch be requested to be present at\nthe meeting of the committee, so as\nto offer suggestions to the new ordi\nnance.\nOrdinance number 51, which in\neffect is to do away with the operat\ning of eating houses in the rear of\nsaloons, which eating houses have no\nstreet entrance, was passed and will\nbe effective on and after July 1, 1911.\nThe March report of the chief of\npolice, Joseph Harrington, showing\nthat 70 arrests had been made and\nthat 21 of them had been committed\nwas read and accepted by the council.\nThe total amount taken in from fines\nand costs amounted to $337.\nThe Bemidji Pioneer was awarded\nthe city printing, there being one\nother bidder, the Bemidji Sentinel.\nThe report of the municipal court\nas being turned over, $40, to the\ncity treasurer was accepted.\nWILL MEET THIS EVENING\nCommercial Club to Hold Regular\nMonthly Meeting.\nThis evening in the rooms of the\ncommercial club the members of that\norganization will hold their regular\nmonthly meeting.\nAs there are numerous matters of\nmore or less importance to be dis\ncussed at the meeting it is urged\nby the president and secretary that\nas many members as possible be pres\nent.\nIt is also urged that all members\nwho have been appointed to com\nmittees be present, as the president\nwill outline their work for the enA\nsuing: year.-?\n\'"""St\nMINNESOTA ~K.hj-\nHISTORICAL^\'\nSOCIETY,\n1\n*3f .\'1\nvo3\n^\'1\ni\n4\nA\n^1\n1\nft\n\'4\n3\njr*\nNT\n*Ji\n,& if"\'"', 'HHWHtta\nTRE BEMIDJI DAILY PIONEER\nPULIUtO HIM AFTIMMIIKIPT IWMf IT\nTHE BEMIDJI PIONEER PUBL1SHIMB CO.\nH.

Depew as a\nmember of the United States senate\nfrom the Empire state.\nThe great trusts and combines\nand corporate interests will be sad\nto see the passing of Chauncey but\naside from that few tears will be\nshed over Mr. Depew\'a retirement\nto private life.\nHis successor is a Tammany\nproduct and he owes his election to\nthat corrupt organization. But while\nhe comes from evil origin he shows\nup as about the best, most able and\ncleanest man that could well be ex\npected to be honored with a toga\nby the present New York legislature.\nSenator O\'Gorman has declared\nthat he is in favor of the direct\nelection of the United States sena\ntors that he is for a downward re\nvision of the tariff Canadian reci\nprocity parcels post a federal\nincome tax and "rigid economy" in\nthe handling of the government\'s\nmoney. He also favors a fortifica\ntion of the Panama canal.\nNot all of these things may be for\nthe best good of the republic but as\npractically all of them are at direct\nvariance with the things for which\nTamany stands, the O\'Gorman plat*\nform furnishes interesting material\nfor speculation as to whether the\nnew senator really means what he\nsays. If he does he will come nearer\nrepresenting the people of New York\nthan any Democrat from that state\nhas for a good many years,\nJudge O\'Gorman\'s past life has\nbeen such as to entitle him to. con\nfidence on the part of the public and\nit has reason to believe that he wil\ntry to live up to his platform and\nwork in behalf of the interests of the\npeople.\nA LITTLE MATTER OF $182,680 O SO.\nEven the democrats do things\nnow and then which are bound to\ncause the people to nod approval.\nFor instance, the decision of the\ndemocratic congress to do away with\na carload of useless House em\nployes and to discontinue the habit\nof giving those who remain thirteen\nmonths pay for twelve months\' work\ndoes sound like an improvement.\nHere we have the proposed sav\nings itemized:\nThree jobs in speaker\'s\noffice $ 2,320\nTwenty-eight jobs in clerk\'s\noffice 39,970\nTwenty-eight jobs in door\nkeeper\'s office 31,340\nForty-two jobs in sergeant\nat-arms office 47,050\nSix useless committees 12,000\nOne month\'s extra pay to\neach employe annually... 50,000\nlaneous economies in incidental ex\npenses which bring up the actual\ntotal of retrenchment to an amount\napproximating $200,000 a year.\nThe doing away with the extra\nmonth\'s pay is especially commend\nable. This perquisite was the in\ngenious invention of an imaginative\nmember of the "old guard" in, the\nHouse. It was supposed to be in\nlieu of mileage, although why em\nployes of the congress should have\nmileage any more than any other\ngovernment employe has never been\nexplained. This action on the part\nof the House probably will result in\na like action on the part of the\nsenate, so a total of about $80,000 a\nyear will have been made in this\nway.\nThe useless committees abolished\nare those on Pacific railroads, manu\nfacturers, militia-presided over by\nour own Halvor Steenersonprivate\nland claims, levees, and improve\nments and acoustics and ventilation\nAnd even without, this last named\nCounty 8at\nPopulation\n6099.\nSummer BesortHundreds of outsid\ners make their summer home on Lake\nBemidji.

The president\ncovered a eood deal of ground in\nhis short telegram. First, be recog\nnized the fact that. Dr. Vincent is\none of the country\'s greatest educa\ntors second, that- the university is\none of the country\'s greatest seats\no: learning and third that a worthy\nsuccessor,to that dear, old lovable\nFrexv, Cyrus Northrop, is a treas\nure of which Minnesota may well\nfeel proud,.\nThe coming of Vincent and pass\ning of Northrop must ever stand as\nan important page in the history of\nthe University. Pathetic as it needs\nmust be is the final goodbye to\nactive work of the venerable. presi\ndent emeritus, the scenes of his\nactual leave taking was made less,\ndue. painful because, happily, Dr. North-1 that dynamic power, natural acumen\nrop, as usual was "in rare good land technical training of which he\n^^m^^w^m^W^^^^-\nhumor." j^s\nIn speaking his students, who\nlove him as a chid does his father,\nDr. Northrop in lis talk said:\n"Heave you njw. God*bless you\nall While I ha been your presi\ndent I have triec to do my duty.\nNow let George it."\nAnd again latir in the day when\na member of the \'acuity was looking\nparticularly sad and solemn, .Dr.\nNorthrop gave lim a nudge and\nsaid A\n"Cheeroip, thij is my funeral, not\nyours."\nAnd so, although his own heart\nmust have beenjieavy, Dr. North\nrop.twhohas guided with a master\nhand the destinies of the great seat\nof learning, stepped down and out,\ncarrying wjth him the best wishes of\na grateful people together with\nearnest, hopes that many years of\nquiet, peaceful rest lay before him.\nTo the new president, who comes\nwith high honors from Chicago, and\nwho jumps into his position as if he\nmeant business from the word go,\ngreetings are extended. As the in\nstitution over which he now presides\nunfolds and expands he will need all\nis the fortunate possessor for .the\nhand, which is to guide the Univer\nsity of Minnesota to that supreme\nheight to which it aspires and by\nright should achieve, must, be a\nsteady one.\nWhen a medicine must be given\nto-young children it should he pleas\nant to take.
