Reports from the\nmovements of the American command\ners south of Manila show that Qeu.\nDates and Gen. Wheaten are at Perez\nDas Marinas and Gen. Schwan at Si\nlong, all awaiting the arrival of pro pre\nvision wagons. Recennaissances have\nshown that 1,000 armed Insurgents\nhave retired te the mountains from\nthe district between Indang and Maig,\nand that ethers have retreated along\nthe coast from Nevellta toward Ha\ntangas. Tuesday night Nelan\'s squadron of\nthe 11th cavalry drove n body of in\nsurgents from Maig. One American\nwas killed and two wounded. Thir\nteen dead Filipinos were found.\nThe movement largely resembles\nGen. Schwan\'s experience in the same\ncountry, except that the towns are\nnew being garrisoned, and that the\ninsurgents refuse te light, retreating\nsouthward nnd dividing into small\nbands, with the apparent Intention of\nreassembling later. About 100 insur\ngents have been killed, but compara\ntively few arms have been taken.\nThe region is full of Amigos, who\ndoubtless have been bearing arms,\nwhich they have hidden. The women\nand children remain in their homes,\nand the Insurgents, as they fall back,\nrelease all prisoners they have cap\ntured. It is asserted en high authority thnt\nArchbishop Nebelaeda contends in his\nInterviews with Mgr.
