This is strictly a dry\n(arm. Years ago the water right was I\nsold to the railroad people and since J\nthat time the farm has been worked\non the dry method. .\nMarion Little, who for years J\nworked the place, always had good!\ncrops, .but under the new manage-J\nmerit it has been vastly improved j\nLand that was formerly tegarded as\nonly fit for pasture is now put to use j\nand is yielding a heavy crop of grain.\nOne party who visited the place\nthis spring informed the owners\nthat the wheat which is growing\nwould never head properly. Samples\nof the grain show exceedingly heavy\nkernels. . It will produce more to the\nacre than several of the- irrigated\nfarms in this valley.\nAt the present time the cutting of\nhay is in full blast at the farm and\nan exceedngly heavy crop is being\nstacked. Modern dry farm methods\nhave been used the past couple of\nyears in working the soil and alkali\nlands. The alkali lands in this in\nstance are producingg the best grain\non the farm. Those who are inter\nested in dry farming in this section\nof Nevada can take some pointers\nfrom this farm, that will be of last\ning benefit.\nBig Company Fast Trip\nRents Bit Range! Made to Reno\nu\nThe Dangberg Coinpapny has\nrented the range formerly used by\nTom Rickey at the head of Carson\nRiver. This is considered one of\nthe finest summer ranges in the en\ntire West. The Truckee River Gen\neral Electric Company purchased the\nholdings from Rckey a number of\nyears ago and ha9 been leasing it to\nsheep men. The moving of cattle\ninto the section will shut out many\nsheep that have been accustomed to\nmaking headquarters up that way\nThere is considerable government\nland in the same section which the\nforest service lets to the sheep men.\nIt is mostly occupied by California\nherders who drive over from the\nother side.\nWhat can you do? . he an amateur.\nLightening Plays\nMany Pranks\nSupperiniendent Leavitt of the lo\ncal division of the Truckee River\nGeneral Electric Company left for\nYerington this morning to make re\npairs to a transformer at that place\nthat was struck and burned out by\n\' lightning yesterday.

Raycrait, of Carson, driving\na Studerbaker-4U machine, and carry\ning two passengers, made the trip\nfrom Carson to Reno " yesterday\n) morning in one hour and one min\nute. The record between the two\npoints, is 55 minutes as set by Jack\nPayne some time ago.\nRaycraft carried two brothers by\nthe name of Darbough of Gardner\nville, who desired to catch train No.\n10 for Ogden where another brothei\nis at the point of death. They arriv\ned in Carson during the jnornng and\nin order to make connections with the\ntrain they found it necessary to char;\nter the automobile.\nRaycraft made the distance travel\ning at high speed all the way and\nlanded his passengers here just five\nminutes before the train left.\n- o-\nFour new films, late releases, and\nsure to please you, at the GRAND\nto-night, all for ten cents. .\nIS MUCH BETTER\nGeorge Dangberg, who is suffering\nwith blood poisoning, was consider\nably better this morning.

Mr. Witcher declares\nthat the Board was justified in all its\nacts. Mr. Witcher\'s statement is as\nfollows:\n\'\'Up to the time Governor Dicker\nson\'s Board went into office there\nhad been practically no state bank\nlaws; consequently when they as\nsumed office they found a number of\nbanks that did not conform to the\nlaw and to have closed them all up ! nominee, but instead appointed a sta\nwithout giving them a reasonable tionary engineer to take charge -ot\ntime to get themselves in shape\nwould have been little short of crimi\nnal and would have closed or wreck\ned more than half the banks in the\nstate.\n"The Banking Board are entirely\nsatisfied with their course and feel\nthat it not only merits no censure,\nbut is entitled to all praise for the\nmanner in which they handled the\nthe $400,000 of assets. It was but\nnatural that he could not get the best\nresults;, consequently the bank has\nthus reailzed but 50 cents on the dol\nlar. The depositors are naturally\ndissatisfied with results and if Judge\nBreen cannot shift the blame to the\nBanking Board he must shoulder it\nhimself. Hence his wild charges\nagainst the Board."\nReno Papers\nMake Mistakes\nNo Identification\nWas Made\nThe Reno papers continue to get\nthings on the wiong trail. They have\nbeen announcing that Lawrence, the\nformer postmaster of -Hazen, who is-\nserving a life-sentence for murder,\nhas been pardoned.

GRMN\nLESSEE AND MANAGER\n, Snap Shot Judgment\nThe result of the publication of the damaging stories by newsrv\npers is receiving considerable discussion since the Reno Gazette took\nsnap-shot rumors and framed theai into a story against several citizens\nin Nevada who acted on the old State Banking Board. The livable is\nthat the paper" men did not trace the story down to its origin and\ntook a chance in, order to. work a scoop. The result is that there will\nprobably be lible suits to follow. .\nOne of the first instructions while working on the large daily pa\npers throughout the American held is to vcriffy a story. The laaiiag\ning editor is held responsible for all slips and .while a cub may make\na break it falls upon the man in charge. The old rule established in\nthe dailies is the "alleged" or "rumor" that mud be used in connec\ntion\' where there is doubt. No such positive statement as was used\nby the Nevada paper is allowed where mtn Know their business.\nThe unfortunate affair is that while there is no truth in an article\nof damaging\' nature at the same time it is circulated broadly and in\nmany instances those who originally publish a sensational story fail to\ncontradict it should it prove to be false. Thus the sting is left where\nit works a hardship.\nIt is a sure thing that the paper will in the future verify its\nstatements, and while it. may be an expensive lesson, at the same\ntime it is one that will not be repeated in a hurry. Every newspapaer\n\' is liable to blunder, but like every other mistake it is not forgiveable\nunder the lawj or the parties offended.\nLaw Does Not Please\nThe supreme court has decided that the portino of the banking\nlaw which was to take the receivership of the defunct banks out of the\nhands of men appointed by the courts and pplace them in the hands\nof the state bank examiner is unconstitutional. It is unfortunate\nthat the law is that waj, and depositors in these institutions are as\na rule not pleased with conditions. While there are no personal\nobjections to the gentlemen who now occupy these responsible posi\ntions, it is the opinon of many that the system of handling this\nkind of business in vogue now is incorrect. A man with sufficient\neducation and intelligence to handle a job of this kind realizes that\nthe more efficient he is, and the sooner he closes up the affair, the\nSooner he is out of a job. Therefore, the present,- sytem actually\npays him more for not finishing his task than for closing it up\nquickly. On the other hand, the state bank examiner receives his\npay for the given term whether he has any unfinished business on\nhand- or not. So long as he has a a bank or two hanging fire he has\ntrouble on his hands in the form of additional work and tjje unf\'riend-\n. ly criticism of dissatisfied creditors. He will therefore lose no\nunnecessary time in closing out the affairs of the defunct banks in\n. self-defense. Wonder Mining . News.\nAsks an Amendment\n. Several days ago a man convicted of a crime was sent to this city\nto serve his term in the penitentiary under the sentence imposed by the\njudge of the court. There were many complications in the case and an\nappeal has been filed in the Supreme Court for a re-trial. It is pos\nsible that a new trial will be granted and it is further possible that the\nman may be freed and cleared of the charges agaiast him.\nIn the meantime he has been taken before the authorities author\nized under the law and his measurements taken along with his photo\ngraph. The attorney representing theprisoner declares that this is a wrong\nproceeding. Should the man be cleared of the chargges the fact re\nmains that his photograph measure ments have been placed in the\nRogue\'s gallery. ; He has no reddress.and it is not likely that the rec\n\' ords will be destroyed.. The attorney stated that at the next meeting\nof the Legislature he would offer an amendment to the law providing\nfor the protection of the citizen who has a case pending before the court\n\' He contends, and seemingly right., that no man is convicted until the\nCourts agree on the merits of the case. It seems that the attorney\nhas found a flaw in this section of the police practice that needs adjustment.\nr\nWe Want a Share\nof Your Job Printing\n.
