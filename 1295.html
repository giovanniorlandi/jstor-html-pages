HOFF.\nPRESIDENT BUDGE TO THE\nPEOPLE.\nLast week\'s Post contained an\narticle from the pen of Win. Badge,\non the political issues of the day.\nThe scare head on the epistle show\ned plainly for whose consumption\nthe article was intended, and the\nway the people were to be reached.\nThe title was "Pres. Wm. Budge.\nNot "Senator" Budge, nor "Mr.\nBudge, but "President" Budge.\nThe head inferred that he was speak\ning to the people as a churchman,\nand by reason of his high ecclesias\ntical position, his title in the church\nwas used. It was notice to the Lat\nter Day Saints that their president\nwas advising them, not as a citizen\nnot as an office seeker, but as "presi\ndent.\nMr. Budge is a republican, he is\na candidate ior office on that ticket,\nhe desires the success of that party,\nto all of which we do not particu\nlarly object, except as a democrat\nrepresenting the opposite side to his\nbeliefs. But we do, Us a citizen of\nIdaho, object to his addressing the\npeople on political issues, fron the\nstandpoint of a church president.\nIt savQrs too much of a mixture of\nchurch and state. We applaud his\nefforts to uphold law and order, but\nwe object to his attempt to turn\nthem to political account.\nBut about the article itself:\nHis sole effort in the article men\ntioned is an attempt to defeat the\nfusion forces in Bear Lake, and in\nIdaho. He quotes from Ben Till\nman and Altgeld, and conveys the\ninformation that they represent the\ndemocratic idea of upholding the\nlaw. It would be just as consistent\nfor us to quote from the Pennsyl\nvania coal mine owners, who are all\nrepublicans, and who said not long\nago, through one of their number,\nthat "if the strike lasted long they\nwould import p&uper labor," all of\nwhich is in violation of the law and\nthey know it. We say it would be\njust asjconsistent for us to charge\nthese people with voicing the senti\nments of the republican party,\nsimply because these men are repub\nlicans. Such argument is rot.\nMr. Budge asks this question:\nIf Mr. Bryan should unfortunately\nbe elected president, who are likely to\nbe members of his cabinet? Who will\nbe the possible men to whom he will\nseek for advice? Why the answer is\nsimple enough: They will be men of\nthe class referred to; friend of the law\nless. enemies of our sacred constitution,\nmen who will represent the leaders of\nthis fusion party, the restless and dis\nsatisfied elements of society.\nOhl is that so? When ^lid the\npresident" get this revelation\nto Bryan\'s cabinet? And even if it\nis true, will they not be as good\nOrigga, w ho is the representative\nand tool of the trusts, or Hay, who\nis the poodle of England, or Root\nwho has violated the constitution\nor assisted in it, in his Porto Rico\nandPhilippine policy, or Smith who\nis everyday viôlating the postal laws\nof the country for the benefit of the\nrepublican party? What\'s the dif\n»\nM\n»,\nit\nas\nas\nference in McKinley\'s cabinet and\nthe one Mr. Budge has selected for\nBryan? Just this. The monopo\nlistic class can and do violate the\nspirit and letter of the law and con\nstitution everyday, and their repre\nsentatives, high up in the McKinley\ngovernment, uphold them in it, be\ncause they have the present adminis\ntration by the throat and it dare not\nsqueak, nor enforce the dictates of\nits own conscience, if it has any.\nThings bave come to that pass where\nmoney rules the people through\nthe »republican party, and it is more\ndespotic than any king that\nlived.\never\nWhatever it does is lawful\nin the eyes of Mr. Budge and the\nrepublican party.\nIf Bryan ohooses Altgeld or Ben\nTillman or such men for his advis\nors, the people will get a chance,\noccasionally at least, and the money\nkings won\'t have it all their\nway.\nmasses violating the law and the\nclasses doing the same thing,\nwill stand with the masses.\nown\nIf it is a choice between the\nwe\nBut Mr. Budge says it is not the\nthe principals he considers, it is the\nteachings of the fusion leaders.\nWell, we will take the leaders.\nDo\nyou think, or do the people think,\nStsndrod will enforce law in this\nstate any quicker than Frank Hunt\nwill? Did McConnell enforce law\nand order in the Couer d\'Alenes\nwhen he was governor, like Steun\nenberg did? McConnell\npublican and Steunenberg\nfusion officer. Do the records\ntain your contention, Mr. Budge?\nThen what does this article mean ?\nSimply a plea to the Latter Day\nSaints as such, from their church\nleader in this\nwas a re\nwas a\nsus\ncounty, for political\nIt is a shameful prostitution\nof the high church office of presi\ndent, and it ought, and we believe i\nit will be,\neffect.\nstrongly condemned\non Nov. 6th, that Mr. Budge will\nbe retired to private life for all\nso\nIt is getting cooler but\nwon\'t notice it if you use\nyou\nJEWEL STOVES and RANGES\nOur .line of WOOD and COAL HEAT\nERS, CAST and STEEL RANCES\nand all kinds of COOK\nSTOVES is complete.\nSEE the VULCAN HOT BLAST\nAlso stove boards, coal hods,—in fact\neverything to help you warm\nConsolidated Implement Co.\n(Of Course.)\nup.\nyears to come.\nIf the people arc td be free in\nname, let them be free in fact, to\nchoose according to their own\njudgment.\nDr. Calloway\'s Itinery.\nDr. Calloway will deliver demo\ncratic speeches at the following\nnamed places in Bear Lake county\nbeginning to-morrow night:\nOvid, Saturday, Oct. 30th,\nLiberty, Monday, Oct. 22nd.\nNounan, Tuesday, Oct. 23rd. *\nWard boro Wednesday, Oct. 24tft*\nBloomington, Thursday, Oct. 25.\nLanark, Friday, Oct. 26th.\nEveryone is invited to come out\nand hear this gentleman.

No\npassengers were injured as far as\nwe can learn. Messrs. Beckman\nand Short were immediately taken\nto the Salt Lake hospital,\nj As\'freajr as can be learned the ac\ncident occurred as follow\'s:\n1 Conductor McCollom, having in\ncharge a freight train, had arrived\nat Topaz and was preparing to take\nthe sidetrack when his train broke\nin two. He immediately sent a flag\nman hack to stop No. 1, and give\nhim time to get in the clear. After\nchaining up his train he signaled\nhis engineer to pull ahead onto the\nsidetrack. The engineer whistled\nhis answer, and the flagman mistook\nit for a signal to come in, thinking\nthe train was safely on the side\ntrack. Right at thia point on the\nroad is a sharpj-curve, making it\nimpossible to see the switch for any\ndistance. Just as the flagman got\nto his train Engineer Beckman came \'\naround the curve running at per\nhaps 50 miles an hour, as he was\nmaking up lost time.\n"Nienginecr and fireman saw the rear If\n<H^cl of the freight immediately.

Mr. Short\'s shoulders and\nback are frightfully lascerated and\nhe also received other injuries. At\nlast accounts both were resting eas.\nily and m no apparent danger.\nAs near as we can learn from\nthere were three tramp»\naway on the train. One of\nthèee was killed instantly, being\npractically disemboweled. Another\nbad a leg broken and a third escap\ned uninjured.\nThe engine struck the caboose\nand demolished it, then veered off\nto one side.
