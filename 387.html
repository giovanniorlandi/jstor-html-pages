        <pre>['PUBLISHED TIEREE\nSHOWS FIGHT\n_?\nZelays Refuses to Notice Officially Knox\'s\nUlttimatum and\nAPPEALS TO CONGRESS\n, ?* -??\nPresident of Nicaragua Will, it is\nReported, Ask (ingress to Inter\nfere With the State Department\nProgram?Men Supposed to be His\ni, .\' m 2b a\nAgents Reach Washington.\nPresident Zelaya has not only re\n> fused to take official cognizance of\nSecretary knox\'s" note, which was\npractically an ultimatum, but he is\ndeclared tqrhave dispatched special,\nagents^to- Washington tp endeavor to\nhave theSta\'te department\'s ulti\nmatum set\'-aside," first by appeals\nto the department, and seondly by\ndirect appeals to members of Con\ngress. The State department is en\ntirely aware of the presence and\nidentity of these emissaries. These,\nspecial agents are being watched in\n.a general way.\nIt was reported- that any attempt\n?that-Zelaya might make to escape\nfrom the country would receive the\ndirect and vigorous attention of the\nAmerican warships now :lying off the\ncoasts of Nicaragua; ? Secretary Knox\nnasVintimated in the plainest lan\nguage--that the State department\nlooks upon Zelaya as the man re\nsponsible for the torture and death\nof the two Americans, Groce\' and\nCannon. ^\nThe" plan to deflect the United\nStates government-program with ref\nerence to Nicaragua came tc light\nwhen Scnor Fernando Sanchez and j\nDr. V. M. Roman arrived at Wash-j\nington. Neither (3enor Sanchez nor.\nDr. Roman would talk. They gave\ntheir address-as New- York.\nMembers of the Central American\ndiplomatic corps, however, were in\na flutter when they discovered the\nnew arrivals. Sen or Sanchez, they\ndeclared, is a partner of Zelaya in\nmany of the latter\'s business ven\ntures in Nicaragua, and he has man\naged to amass a fortune of between\nfour and five million dollars in gold.\nDr.) Roman, j the report continued,\nlong has been Senor Sachez\'a busi\n-ness adviser, and he also is a close\nfriend and adherent of Zelaya.\nDuring Friday-afternoon and early\nevening more than a score of tele\n.! grams were dispatched . from Senbr\nSanchez\'s rooms. Almost an equally\nlarge number were received. This,\ntelegraphic activity , the Central\nAmericans insist, is aimed at mem\nbers of Congress, with a view of\nwinning over enough of them to\nrender the Administration\'s present\nprogram inoperative in the event if\nis presented to Congress.\nDr. Salvator Castrillo, the diplo\nmatic agent of the provisional gov\nernment of Nicaragua and represen\n? tative of the revolutionists, here,\nmade formal request to Secretary\nKnox ,that he be received on equal\nterms with the agents of the Zelaya\ngovernment. It is generally believ\ned th3t Dr. Castrillo\'s request will\nbe granted,\n\'ft While making, all. preparations for\naction, this government has resumed\nthe claim that preceded the issue of\nSecretary Knox\'s note. There were\nno developments In the State de\npartment Friday. To all appearanc\nes the department is "marking time"\nuntil occasion arrives for further\naction. ?\nSIXTY KILLED LAST YEAR.\nRailroads Submit Report to Kail\nroad Commission.\nSixty-seven people were killed and\n758 injured on the railroads of the\nState during the past fiscal year, ac\ncording to the annual report of the\ntwenty-five companies received by\nthe railroad commission. It is shown\nin the last annual report of the com\nmission that 5 7 were killed and 1,\n0S7 injured. It will be seen that\nthe number willed on the ralroads\nhas been increased by ten, while the\nnumber of injured was less by sev\neral hundred. The fiscal year ended\non June 30. The commission is now\ncompiling: the statistical part of its\nannual report. ?\nProf. Riggs in Charge.\nCol. M. B. Hardin. director of th"\nchemical department, who was elect\ned acting president of Clemson to\nsucceed Dr. P. H. Mel] on January\n1, until the hoard can find a presi\ndent, has eclined to servo.

Prof. Riggs is director of\nthe mechanical department. *\nSix Seamen Perish.\nAdvices received by the United\nStates weather bureau from Tatoosh\nIsland, Wash., suite that the It-i:\nish four-masted bark Matterhorn\nfounded at sea November 2 7, seven\n;y miles off Umatilla Reef. The first\nmate, steward and four sailors were\ndrowned. Twenty-seven of 1 he crew\nwere saved. *\nDied a Hero.\nAt Chicago Dennis Kelly, a flag\nman, was killed in the act of sav\ning a woman standing bewildered on\nthe track in front of an approach\ning train. ?\nTIMES A TVilEKo\nCAN\'T USE THE MAILS\nTHAT RIGHT TAKEN FROM A\nSHODY CHICAGO COMPANY,\nWhich Hus Been Swindling the\nUnwary by Pushing Off on Them\nPinchback Jewelry. ? \' .\nPostmaster-General Hitchcock has\nsigned a fraud order depriving the\nErie Manufacturing Company, 5645\nWest Lake street, Chicago, of fur\nther use of the mails. Under this\nname E. F. Hansell has been engag\ned In a scheme for obtaining mon\ney through the mails by means of\nfalse and fraudulent pretenses in dis\nposing of a line of cheap jewelry.\nOn investigation the Inspector\n?learned that Hansell had been en\ngaged for several years in selling\nthe trashiest kind of alleged jew\nelry, exclusively through the mails.\nHe advertised to grvo ^ree a s0^^\ngold-plated watch, to boys or girls\nor anyone selling 20 pieces of his\nhandsome jewelry at 10 cents each.\nWhen the addresses sent in name,\nthe jewelry was to be sent post\npaid, and when sold the $2 was to\nbe sent to Hausell and the free gold\nwatch would be forwarded.\nFor sometime complaints have\nbeen received at the postofllce de\npartment from parties having fallen\ninto the clutches of Hansell by re\nmitting their $2, and who were un\nable to get the^ promised watch, and\nfrom some, having sent the $2, who\nwere subsquently annoyed by letters,\nintimating that they were withhold\ning the money to defraud the Erie\nCompany.\nAmong the more recent complaints\nreaching the department was one\nfrom\' the British ambassador at\nWashington, in which it was stated\nthat "an English lad at school in\nNew Jersey had received, unsolicited,\na package of this alleged jewelry\nand had at once returned it to the\nErie Company. Nevertheless, the\nlad continued to receive threatening\nduns,- until-finally; in.boyish desper\nation, he attempted suicide, and by\nthe merest chance- he was prevented\n?from accomplishing it.\nIt has been disclosed by the in\nspector that the trash sold by Han\nsell as jewelry is manufactured at\nProvidence, R. I., and costs him\n$2 for 144 pieces. The 20 pieces,\nfor which be receives $2, costs blm,\nwith the three cents postage, when\nmailed to the party who sells it for\nhim, about 16 cents, while the gold\nwatches which he offered and only\noccasionally sent as premiums cost\n\'40 cents apiece. Hansell admitted\nthese figures were corrent, showing\nconclusively the mendacity of his\nstatements when disposing of his\ngoods to the public. The postmas\nter at Chicago has reported that the\nErie Company received on an aver\nage of 1,284 pieces of mail a day. *\nWEDNESDAY* UNLUCKY IN M1LT.S\nMore Accidents Happen on That Day\nThan on Any Other iu the Wcelc\nSome interesting-figures in regard\nto accidents in cotton mills are given\nby a writer in the Textile Manu\nfacturers\' Journal. The plants whose\nrecords he took.were twelve in niim\n?ber, and with the exception of one\nin New Hampshire, were South of\nthe Mason and Dixon line.\nOf the total number of acnidents\nonly 42.3 per cent were the reeuit\nof maerinery. The larger percen\ntage happened on Wednesday, and\nwith the exception of Saturday the\npercentage for the other days of\nthe week is generally uniform.\nSaturday shows a iow percentage,\ndue to-two reasons?first, less work\ning hours that day, and in general\nless machinery in operation, thus re\nducing the chance of injury.\nA larger percentage of the acci\ndents occurred during the forenoon\nhours from eight to twelve, while\nthe lowest percentage are shown in\nthe starting and stopping hours, sis\nto seven a. m., one to two and fiv<?\nto six p. m.\nThe larger number of accidents\noccurred in May, June, July and Au\nguest, and the smaller number in\nMarch and December.\n"1 am unable to explain why more\naccidents happen in summer months\nthan the other periods of the year,"\n1 writes the investigator, unless it is\nbecause of the greater number of\nchildren employed during school va\ncation. It is also possible that more\ncarelessness or inattention may havo\nbeen shown, caused by the high tem\nperature of the season.\n"The largest number of accidents\noccurred tu those sixteen y<\\ars old,\nthe next smaller number to those six\nteen and twenty-two years old. The\naverage time employed before in\njury was 2.78 yeurs. Nearly 5 per\ncent of the entire number of acci\ndents occurred within a week of the\ntime tue parties entered upon service\nat the plants, about lli per cent with\nin a month, about 5S per cent within\na year, tile balance, -12 per cent,\noccurring between one year\'s serv\nice and 35 years\' service. *\nDutch Omni Got to John D.\nCount P. A. de Vries was success\nful this past week in reaching Joh-:\nD. Rockefeller at his home in Forest\nHill, near Cleveland, 0. The count\nsought to interest the financier ?n\nhis scheme to drain the Zyder Zee,\nHolland, and open it to truakiug.\nHe had tried frequently to meet j\nJohn D., and once was fired upon I\nwhen he persisted too strongly. *\nORAHGEBUB?\nWHOLESALE POISONING\nMRS. MARY KELLEHER CHARGED\nWITH KILLING SIX PERSONS.\nIs the Woman a Fiend Inhuman, or\nan Innocent Victim of Unusual\ni Circumstances?\nIs Mrs. Mary Kelleher, who is\nabout to be placed on trial in East\nCambridge, Mass., a vicitm of a\nstrange combination of circumstanc\nes, or is she a fiend fit to be classed\nwith Mrs. Guinness, H. H. Holmes\nand other notorious characters who\nmade murder their profession? At\ntendants and others who have had\nopportunity to study the woman dur\ning the year she has spent in the\nEast Cambridge jail declare that she\ndoes not betray any of the usual\ntraits of a murderess. On the other\nhand, phS\'sicians who have examin\ned the stomachs of her alleged vic\ntims are said to have discovered\nunmistakable traces of arsenic.\nSextuple Murderess?\nMrs. Kelleker- is accused of mur\ndering six persons ,and all were\nmembers of her own family. The\ndetectives found evidence of the\npayment of life insurance to Mrs.\nKelleher after the death of each\nmember of her family. The case of\nthe prosecution is based on the claim\nthat Mrs. Kelleher was the person\nwho had exclusive opportunity Jto\nadminister the poison, and that sh\';\nwas the only person to benefit in a\npecuniary way from the death of\nthose who died. It is also alleged\nthat during the brief Illness of each\none, Mrs. Kelleher employed no nurse\nand bad only occasional assistance\nfrom friends and neighbors.\nFive of the deaths in the Kelleher j\nfamily occurred in the woman\'s home\nin Somerville. The sixth occurred\nin the Carney hospital in South\nBoston.\nThe first death of the series was\nthat of Bridget Knowles, sister of\nMrs, Kelleber. She died on June\n30, 1905. The cause of death was\nset forth as rheumatism, nephritfsrr1\nand a disease of the heart. On\nMarch 1, 1906, came the second\ndeath, chat of Annie T. Kelleher,\nsister-in-law of the accused woman.\nThe third death was that of Mrs.\nKelleher\'s husband, who died less\nthan three months after Annie Kel\nleher. Six months later Mary Kel\nleher, a daughter, died, and the fol\nlowing January occurred the death\nof "William Kelleher, a son. \' The\nsixth death was that of another\ndaughter, Catherine M. Kelleher,\nwhose sudden death" was ascribed to\nptomaine poisoning. *\nBRITISH STEAMER SINKS.\nThirty Men Perished in Storm Off\nEnglish Const.\nIn a terrific gale that raged Fri\nday over the British Isles the steam\ner Thistlemor went to her doom off\nAppledere in Barnstable Bay. It is\nbelieved that her entire crew of\nthirty men perished. Four bodies\nfrom the steamer .already have been\nwashed ashore. The Thistlemor was\nin command of Capt. Yco, and was\nbound from Liverpool for an Ameri\ncan port.\nSmall- vessels everywhere were at\nthe mercy of the elements, and\nLloyds reports eight of thorn hav\ning been driven ashore at various\npoints. Their crews, however, all\nescaped.\nThe British steamer Congress,\nwhich arrived at Falmouth a few\ndays ago, reports that during the\nstorm her captain, the mate, and\none seaman were washed overboard\nby mountainous seas. The seaman\nwas picked up, but the captain and\nmate perished.\nThe British SteamJSr Thistlemor\nwas of 4,OOS tons, and was built\nin 1906, at Stockton, England. She\nwas owned by the Albany Line, of\nSunderland. 9\nGIRL LOST IN MOUNTAINS.\nPosse Fiuds Her in on Almost\nFrozen Condition.\nMiss, Mary Overstreet, a well\nknown young woman cf Roanoke,\nVa., was found on the side of Mill\nMountain, near there Friday by a\nposse of searchers, her body being\nstretched on the frozen ground and\nher head resting on a pile of stones.\nShe was so numb from exposure\nthat sh^> was almost unconscious.\nShe visited the home of a friend in\nthe s^\'thern section of the city\nthe dt... before, and instead of re\nturning to her own home after leav\ning the friend\'s house, wandered into\nthe country. ?\nKilled in Runaway.\nHerman (Rogowski, a pioneer citi\nzen of Tampa, Fla., was killed there\nFriday morning when a buggy in\nwhich he and N. L. Meyer, of Phil\nadelphia, collided with a truck and\nwas overturned. The horse had\nbeen frightened by another truck\nand was moving rapidly at the time.\nMr. Glokowski\'s skull was crush\ned. ?\nDuring Little (;irls.\nTwo little girls, Annie Smith and\nLucie Leuke, in escaping from the\nreform school at Milwaukee, took a\ndaring forty-mile ride to Jefferson\nJunction clinging to the rods under\nneath a passenger train. The Smith\ngirl is not expected to live as a re\nsult of her experience. *\nS. C, TUESDAY, DEC]\nBLINDTIGERS\nHeavy Hit by the New Federal Code\nWhich Regulates toe\nSHIPMENTS OF LIQUOR\nInto Prohibition Territory, Which\nGoes Into Effect on the First of\nJanuary?Railroads and Express\nCompanies Incur Severe Penalties\nif They Violate the New Code.\nAnother phase in the great cam\npaign against liquor will come to\nthe fore the first of next month, when\nthe revised penal code of the Unit\ned States is to become effective.\n.Many of the changes made in the\npenal laws by the Sixtieth congress\nwere of minor interest, but the sec\ntion relating to the shipment of in\ntoxicating liquors into "dry" terri\ntory contained new legislation, the\nresult of which will be to make the\nUnited States a factor in prosecut\ning violators of the act.\n. In thickly settled communities the\nlocal authorities, as a rule, are able\nto deal effectively with offenders, but\nin certain sections of the South and\nWest, where settlement is sparce, the\ntask is not so easy, and the members\nof congress from those sections in\nsisted that the federal government\nshould come to the aid of the local\nauthorities.\nThree sections of the new codifi\ncation relate to the liquor traffic.\nThe most important provision is that\non and after January 1, every ship\nment of intoxicating liquor shall\nbear the name of the consignee, the\nnautre of the contents of the recept\nacle and the quantity contained\ntherein. It is a notorious fact, so\nsay persons who have had experi\nence in attempting to drive out\n,,bIindr.wti#ors,\'4 that practically all\n"the liquor now shipped into pro\nhibited territory is labelled as some\nother commodity, or not labelled at\nall, and frequently addressed to per\nsons other than the consignee.\nThe federal authorities already\nhave sent out notice to all manufac\nturers of intoxicants that their wears\nmust be*-labelled on the outside of\nthe package on and after the first\nof the new year, sotting forth the\nnature of the contents and the ex\nact amount in each package. It is\nbelieved that if the local authori\nties co-operate wjfh" the federal gov\nernment in the enforcement of the\nlaw it will be a comparatively easy\nmatter to suppress the "blind tigers."\nIt is pointed out that from now\non they can not exsit without violat\ning the federal statute, and the as\nsumption of iMo department of jus\ntice is that would-be violators will\nnot care to take the chance of fall\ning into the clutches of the federal\nI courts.\nIt has been alleged from time to\ntime that in some of the States\nwhere the sale of intoxicating liquor\nhas been prohibited in one way or\nanother the railroads and express\ncompanies assisted the violators of\nthe law by acting as buying or sell\ning agents, or both.\' Congress, with\nthe idea of putting a stop to this\npractice, provided as follows:\n"Any railroad company, express,\nCompany or other common narrier.\nor any other person, who, in con\nnection with the transportation of\nany spirituous, vinous, malted, fer\nmented, or other intoxicating liquor\nof any kind, from one State, ter\nritory or district of the United States,\ninto any State, territory or district\nof the United States, or from any\nforeign country into any State, ter\nritory, or district of the United\nStates, shall collect the purchase\nprice or any part thereof before,\non, or after delivery, or Fhall in any\nmanner act as the agent of the buy\ner or seller of any such liquor, for\nthe purpose of buying or seling or\ncompleting the sole thereof, saving j\nonly in the actual transportation and\ndelivery of the same, snail be fined\nnot more than $5,000." :J\nBAKER\'S SLAYER ARRESTED. \\\nNashville Man and Wife of His Vic\ntim Placed in Jail.\nAt Nashville, Tenn.. James Camp-\'\nbell, aged 25. was arrested Friday\nafternoon, charged with killing j\nAdolph Mayr, an aged baker, who\nwas mysteriously murdered in East\nNashville one night three weeks ago.\nThe murdered man\'s widow, aged I\nabout :!.">. was also arrested, charged\nwith being an accesorj to the mur\nder. State warrants were- sworn out\nagainst them by Marshal Gross, who\nalleges that Campbell told him he\nkilled Mayr. Statements claimed to\nhave been made by Campbell to Gros*\nin regard to the alleged rolatiotts\nbetween Mrs. Mayr and Campbell are\nthe basis of tr,e woman\'s ar.-est.\nBoth persons are in jail in default\nof bail.\nShot From Atnbnsh.\nLatiney Blair was shot "near his\nstore on his way home Fridaj tiighr\n\'by unknown parties. Mr. Blair\nis a member of the Dlair-Frazier\nCompany, a large firm doinc busiuess\nat Blair, S. C. He is a very popu\nlar gentleman, and no doubt the\nmiscreant had robbing in view. He\nwas taken to the Columbia hospital\nafter the shooting. ?\nSMBER 7 190**.,\nCAPTAIN it O. PANTZLER IS\nELECTED ITS PRESIDENT.\nA Bill Requiring Hunters to Take\nOut License to be Presented to the\n(Legislature.\nThe annual meeting of the Audu\nbon Society was held in Columbia\nFriday afternoon, when plans for\nthe coming years were discussed and\nofficers elected. One of the impor\ntant matters considered was that of\nplacing before the Legislature the\nneed for a fish and game commis\nsion. A bill along this line was\nj introduced at the last session of the\ni General Assembly, but all the Audu\nbon Society bills were postponed and\nhave a place on the calendar now.\nThe commissioner that would act\nunder such a b?ll woulcUsave a great\namount of work and would syste\nmatize the appointment of game war\ndens. The following officers were\nelected:\nPresident?M. O. Dantzler, Or\nangeburg.\nVice President?W. H. Gibbes, Co\nlumbia.\nSecretary?James Henry Rice, Jr.,\nSummerville.\nTreasurer?A. R. Heyward, Jr.,\nColumbia.\nI The directors are: B. F. Taylor,\nColumbia; Edward L. Wells Charles\nton; Samuel G. Stoney, Charleston;\nPaul Sanders, Ritter; W. H. Andrews,\nGeorgetown; W. G. Sirrine, Green\nville; L. D. Jennings, Sumter; R.\nC. Burts, Easley; A. L. White, Spar\ntanburg; D. Sam Cox, Columbia; G.\nW. Croft, Alken; W. H. Wallace,\nNewberry; F. Perrin, Abbeville;\nR. P. Hamer, Jr., Ilarmer; Neils\nChristensen, Beaufort.\nThe Audubon Society of this State\nwa3 chartered by the General Assem\nbly in 1907; the Society was first\norganized January 4, 1900\nThe treasurer\'s report t showed\nthat, although the membership- dues\nwere not as large as last year, the\nfines totaled up considerably more\nthan in the pervious year.\nThe Audubon Society had several\nbills left on the calendar of the\nGeneral Assembly last season, and\nit is hoped that these bills will be\nreached and favorably disposed of nt\nthis session of the Legislature. One\nof the bills is for the requiring of\na hunter\'s license and provides as\nfollows.\n"It shall be unlawful to hunt game\nwith a gun in South Caroling-with\nout having first procured a^jicense\ntherefor. Violation of this section\nshall be deemed a misdemeanor and\nany person found guilty of so do\ning shall be fined not less than ten\nnor more than twenty-five dollars,\nor be Imprisoned one day for each\ndollar imposed if said fine is not\npaid.\n"Any bona fide citizen of South\nI Carolina may purchase a license from\nI the clerk of court of his county for\nI the sum of one dollar. This license\nshall expire on the first day of April\nin each year.\n"Each hunter shall be required\nto exhibit his license when it shall\nbe demanded of him by any qualK\nfied game warden.\nThe use of the license by any\nperson other than the one to whom\nit Is issued shall constitute forgery\nand be punished the same as for\nother forgeries.\n"The moneys proceeding from the\nhunters\' license shall be transmitted\nmonthly to the State Treasurer to the\n[ credit of the game protection fund\nand shall be disbursed on the order\nof the game commissioner."\nThe bill outlined above-*1fl some\nwhat different from tho.\'or." present\ned to the Legislature last February\nThe now bill is proposed by Secretary\nRice, and the principal change from\nthe old bill is that it makes the of\nfence forgery to hunt with another\nman\'s license.\nCMS PAL OLD AGIO.\nJohn (\'. Culhoun, Negro, Named foi\nHis White .Master.\nJohn (I. Calhoun, colored, nil\nyears old, died in l\'ensacola. Fla.,\na few nights ago. and the death cer\ntificate, as sworn to. gives tin- da\'e\nof the negro\'s birth as 1794. Cal\nhoun lived in l\'ensacola for fort-,\nyears and until less than fourteen\nyears ago made his living by dail.\nlabor in a sawmill. He was on the\npayroll as a yardman for Wright\nCo. at the age of lot.\nIn reminiscent moods the old ne\ngro would tell stories of Ihe life ,,!\'\nbis master. John 0. Calhoun.

While no action has yet been\ntaken by Attorney General Wick\nersham, it is known that President\nTaft has diseased the matter with\nhim with a view to planning a thor\nough investigation in which the De\npartment of Commerce and Labor\nwill act in conjunction.\nFrom New York comes the ruraoi,\nwhich has not been denied in of\nficial circles here, that such an in\nvestigation has already been ordered\nby President. Taft and is about to\nbegin in New York, under the\'dl-j\nrection of Herbert Knox Smith, com\nmissioner of corporations. It has\nbeen learned that if this work has\nbeen undertaken by the government, ]\nsecret agents of the Durnea of Cor\nporations will be employed, and for I\nthe present nothing will be divulged\nin regard to the work.\nBehind this latest move on the\npart of the Federal government are\nthe congressional delegations of all\nof the cotton States of the South\nand of the New England States in\nwhich the great textile mills are lo\ncated. One man who is largely re\nsponsible for tlia interest which\nmembers of congress and the Presi-j\ndent have shown in cotton specula-i\ntiou is Senator John Walter Smith,\nof South Carolina, who for many\nyears has been prominently identi\nfied with .the cotton growers, and\nwent to the Senate with the avowed\npurpose of "going after" the ma\nnipulators of the price of the South\'s\ngreatest prodhct. His cotton speech\nes in the Senate last winter attract\ned wide attention and greatly im\npressed his colleagues.\nCotton mill owners who are ready\nto furnish the government with in\nformation and are .determined,, to\nwage the fight to the very end are\nsaid to represent a capital of $250,\n000,000. Their interest and that of\nthe cotton growers is practically the\nsame in this instance, and the fact\nthat they have joined forces to aid\nthe government in its,proposed In\nvestigation and probable legal action\nis taken to mean that the work will\nbe done thoroughly.\nOfficials of the Department of Jus\ntice who refuse to discuss what the\ngovernment is doing in this connec\ntion nevertheless declare that cotton\ngamblers could be reached under the\nSherman law if it can be establish\ned that their schemes are result\ning In prices that have do relation\nto the value of a bale of cotton.\nClearly, say these officials, that\nwould be restraining trade within\nthe meaning of the anti-trust law.\nThis much is certain, that thuu far\nthe matter is in a preliminary stage,\nand the President and the attorney\ngeneral are not certain themselves\nhow far the work will be carried.\nIf Mr. Wlckersham believes, after\nthe Bureau of Corporations\' inquiry\nis complete, that there is a chance\nof success in the courts, proceedings\nwill be begun. If he does it is more\nthan likely that Mr. Taft will ask\ncongress to enact- legislation under\nwhich this practice may be\nstopped. *\nSTRANGER KILLS HIMSELF.\nBody of an Unknown Man Found in\na Lonely Field.\nTaking such elaborate care in an\neffort to conceal his identity that he\neven cur the maker\'s name trig from\nhis clothing, an unknown man,\nfashionably dressed, was found d?\'ad\nin a lonely field west of Savannah\nat noon Sunday, a costly pistol a:\nhis side and a bullet hob\' in his\nbead.\nA pawn ticket, the only clue .ex\ncept that it is stated that he caine\nto Savannah as a passenger on a\nsteamer from New York, bear-- the\nname- of "It. 11.

CENTS PER COPY\nCOTTON GROWER\nVictim of the System of Trading in\nVogue on the Exchanges.\nNEW YORK THE WORST\nThe Commissioner of Corporations\nCondemns Their Method* unti De\nnounces Future Trading;?He Says\nSystem \\Vork.s Harm to Legitiiun\'e\nProducers and Consumers of Staple\nBoth the producers of cotton and\nthe dealers in that commodity are\nthe victims of the system of trading\nin vogue on the cotton exchanges of\nthe country.\nThis is the burden of parts A a?d\n5 of the report of the commissioner\nof corporations, Herbert Knox Smith,\non the conduct of such exchanges.\nThe practice of dealing in futures,\nas it is carried on at present; is\ncondemned, although the report does\nnot condemn the existauce or the\nexchange.\n"The brief discussion of general\nspeculation in this report," says Mr.\nSmith, "recognizes thv possibilities\nfor good inherent in a great central\nmarket like a cotton exchange, and\nthe need that this good be developed\nand evils eliminated by regulations\nin line with economic law."\nThe report is especially condemn\nnatory of the dealings in futures,\nbranding this form of speculation .as\npure gambling and highly injurious\nto legitimate trade. In. quotations\nfor "future " deliveries of cotton,\nthe market is so uncertain and so\nmany elements of chance enter into\nthe transaction that all bids are made\nat a much lower figure than those\noffered for cotton actually in exiat\nance.\nThe effect of these fictitious\nquotations, the report points put,\ntends to mislead the\' cotton planter\nas to the true value of his crop,\nhonestly grown. In addition, ? it\nieads brokers to "play" both sides\nof the market to protect themselves\nagainst loss in such trades, with the\nresult that the producer is forced\nto pay in the end, while the farmer\nloses likewise.\nThe report, while recognizing that\nthe exchanges in New Orleans and\nNew York are necessary, does hot\nmfnee\'^wo^ds fri^ criticizing tile Slew\'"\nYork exchange. After declaring that ?\nthe New Orleans methods of con>\'\nducting the transactions in cotton\nfollowed natural lirves, the report\ndraws attention to the fact that it\nhas been proved that the abnormal\ndepressions in the future price in\nNew York "were almost wholly due\nto improper artificial conditions now\nmaintained by the . New York ex\nchange. By maintaining them, the\nNew York exchange is responsible\nfor a very real injury to the produc\ner and merchant."\nIn closing the letter to President\nTaft which accompanied his report,\nCommissioner Smith again takes oc\ncasion to reprove the New York ex\nchange. He says:\n"After the publication of the ear\nlier parrs of this report, the New\nOrleans and New York cotton ex\nchanges established special commit\ntees instructed to consider the sys\ntems of their exchanges and to co\noperate therein with the commis\nsioner of corporations. Conferenc\nes have been held by the commis\nsioner with both committees. On\nthe part of New Orleans th\'a co\noperation was very complete, re\nsulting in certain important improve\nments in the rules of that exchange.\nAfter more than a year\'s investiga\ntion, the comml\'.leo of the New York\nexchange has not yet made any final\nreport or taken acy subataulial ac\ntion."\'\nPARTED FIFTEEN YEARS.\nMr. and .Mrs. Rarnett Spyer Decide\nThey Don\'t Like Divorce.\nFifteen years ago Darnett Spyer\nand Mrs. Phoebe Spyer decide! that\nmatrimony did not agree with them,\nand so they took on a decree of\ndivorce in the St. Louis, .Mo., courts.\nNow Mr. Spyer and Mrs. Spyer d.v\n(id\'-s that divorce disagrees with\nthem much b-ss than matrimony, so\nthey were married again a few\ndays ago at the Spy"- home in Bay\nTwenty-second street and Cr?psy ave\nnue.

True sympathy expresses\nitself in practical forms as well as\nin tears and regrets, and happily\nthat is the most common form of\nsympathy in this land of ours.\n-_\n~VFis&t ? blessing in the home is\nmusic. The home that has in it\n\'some good insturment which one or\njnore members of the. family can\n^ay and around which all may gath\ner and sing, is a home that ought\nto ^ flooded with,melody and joy\nthese long winter evenings.\nIt is said that one of the two\ncaen who claim "to have discovered\nthe north pole is suffering from ner\nvous prostration as the result of the\ncontroversy concerning their claims\nA large number of people who have\nbeen following that controversy are\nsuffering in much the same way.\n?A short time ago a \'a ge city\nSally spoke of a man marrying his\n"widow\'s sister." We know that\nowing to the great variety in our\nmarraige sod divorce laws some very\nQueer matrimonial alliances are\nmade, but this is.the first time we\never knew that dead men married,\nfor surely a man must be dead to\nhave a willow. But perhaps the pa\nper meant to say "deceased wife\'s\nsister" instead of "widow\'s sister. \'\nWhen we are viewing some state\nly pile of buildings with its grand\nstaircases, marble halls, and ex\nquisite furniture it is not so much\nOt its temporary occupants we think.\nRather do we\'think of the men who\ndug the foundations, who put stone\nupon stone, who carved and sculp\ntured with artistic skill and whose\nhonest" toil gradually opreared the\nfabric which commands the admira\ntion of men.\nFeudalism is not altogether a\nthing of the past in England. In\nvexatious ways the powers of the\nnobilty are still exerted. The Duke\nof Devonshire has prohibited the\nvillagers on his estate from keeping\npoultry. A tenant farmer, and they\nare mostly tenant farmers, must not\nkill a \'pheasant or any other game\non his farm however much harm they\nmay do. No wonder the feeling\nagainst the lords is almost at white\nheat on the budget question.\nIn view of the knowledge as to\nmany of the business methods of\nthe Standard Oil, Steel. Sugar and\nother trusts, it may well be asked\nin all seriousness if there is any\nmedium sized or large trust that\ndoes not systematically evade and\nviolate the law? Certain it is that\nthe greed for gain, which is respon\nsible for such organizations, and the\nfinancial and other power which\nthese monopolies possess lead uatur?\nally to dishonest and corrupt meth\nods of business and law breaking.\nWhile other trusts have been de\nfending themselves In court the sug\nar trust appears to have put In all\ntts available time in merily plunder\ning the government by cheating the\ncustoms. Now Chat an exposure has\nbeen made and the trust charged\nwith stealing some $30,000.000, the\npublic might naturally expect s 3vert\npenalties to be impojrj? and adequa*e\nrestitution made. But It is hinted\nthat the law of limitation will en\nable the trust to escape. That and\nseveral other things go to show that\nmore effective anti-trust laws are\nsadly needed. j\nFarmers Make the Wealth.\nThe report recently made by Sec\nretary of Agriculture Wilson, which\nwas published in our last issue,\nshows very conclusively who the\nwealth creators of the nation are.\nIn some respects that report is an\nastounding one. It shows that the\nfarmers of this country since last\nJanuary, have created wealth by the\ncrops produced on their farms\namounting to the immense sum of\n$8,760,000,000. Of this enormous\n[ total, - cotton and its bi-products\nshould be credited with one billion\ndollars. This is a magnificent show\ning, and clearly shows that the great\nwealth of this nation is produced by\nthe farmers.\nThe Spartanburg Herald truly says,\n"Such enormous purchasing power\nactually created in toto during a\nsingle growing season, ensures im\nmense and active demand for all\nproducts of other lines of activity.\nIn the long records of time no such\nsplendid hive of Internally harmon\nious and busily prosperous industry\nhas ever been witnessed under the\nsun as is now presented by the 90,\n000,000 people of this republic.\n"It is something for us to dwell up\non with thankful but sober reflec\ntion. In all time wealth has proved\nto be a two edged sword. Used\nwisely it is a blessed power, but?\nlike fire?it is a terrible master.\nIf we can keep this mounting heap\nof wealth well diffused throughout\nall classes, and remember that pos\nsessions are but means to higher\nends, we shall bless the world and\nin blessing shall ourselves be bless\ned. But let this enormous wealth\ndrift into control of a class, who\nlapse from uncorrupt masters to\nservile slaves of the very wealth\nthey own, and then our last state j\nJhall be worse tuan our first."\nThat is the rub. How is it to\nbe kept out of the hands of the\n;lasees when the revenue machinery .\n3f the national \'government is so i\narranged that the classes can plun\nier the producers of this great\nwealth, through the operations,of the\n;bieving tariff laws to their heart\'s\n;ontent. "Meantime," as the Her- .\nihi says, "surely it does look as if \\\n;he future lay in our hands. Never\nsvere any people so dowered with\nleaven\'s favor. The only shadow\n>n our horizon Is that the virtues\naf adversity may be tost fmid .\nabounding success?and without ]\n:hose virtues no nation survives."\nThe Deserters in Congress.\nCongressman Aiken feels strongly\nabout the tariff, and his record -\nagainst legislation for the benefit of 1\n:he few at the expense of the many\njives him the right to express his\nfeelings. He said in Anderson the\n>ther day, in the course of a com\nment on the Payne bill:\n"If it had cot been for the 23\nDemocratic bolters following Tam- 1\nmany in the last session a very dif\nferent sort of tariff bill would have\nbeen passed. It seems to me that\nmany Democrats betrayed the plat\nform and the Democratic members\nand senators who have voted with\nthe Republicans for protection in\nthe past session have done more to\ndestroy the chances for Democratic\nsuccess\' ia the next congress and 3\nwinning in the next presidential\nelection than all the forces of Re\npublicanism."\nIn commenting on the above The\nState says "unquestionably the Dem\nocratic Senators and Representatives\nwho voted with the Republicans for\nany measures of protection are weak\nened as party men. It does not He\nIn their mouths to oppose any meas- 1\nure for protection. They have aban\ndoned the principle." That is true,\nand as Democrats we should see\nthat no man is sent to Congress who\nwill vote to give the trusts the right\nto plunder the people.\nGreatest \'Business Iniquity.\nApparently the Sugar Trust frauds\'\nIs the greatest business iniquity this\nnation has ever experienced. The\nmore it is probed the worse it gets, J\nand yet there is promise of still\nsvorse things to come. What the pub\nlic demands is an Investigation so ,\nthorough and so unhampered by red 1\ntape that no guilty man can possibly\nescape. There are sinister reports\nthat high officials are smirched with\ncorruption. Wo are aware that when ,\njcandals of this character are brought .\nto light sensational and unfounded\nreports are flung far and wide.\nBut whether the charges as to high i\nofficials are true or false can only\nbe determined by an impartial in\nvestigation, and in the interest of\nbusiness and of the nation such\ninvestigation is imperative. It is\nintimated that several cabinets are\ninvolved in this scandal. It seems\nto go back to Cleveland\'s adminis\ntration, and Involves some of the\nmembers of his cabinet. Turn on\nthe light, throw away the white\nwash brush, and let the investiga\ntion proceed. If any so-called Dem\nocrats are mixed up in it, we want\nto know Who they are. Neither fear\nnor favor should be allowed to pre\nvent a full and thorough investi\ngation of this scandal.\nHow to Fight Them.\nNow is the season when mail or\nder houses are flooding the country\nwith their advertisements and cat\nalogues. The way for home mer\nchants to successfully meet such op\nposition is not by complaining and\ngrowling, which has the effect of\ndriving away business, but by imi\ntating far more than they do the\nmethods of their competitors. Mail\norder houses believe in letting peo\nple know what they have to offer.\nToo many local merchants act the\nother way and then complain of dull\ntrade. Such merchants can make\nno headway against outside compe\ntition. But the merchant who keeps\nthe goods and attractively advertis\nes them has the advantage every\ntime. Such merchants always have\na; cheerful smile because business\nis good with them. Suppose you\ngive this recipe a trial, Mr. Merchant.\nIt will not cost you much to try it.\nPneumonia and Consumption.\n"Pneumonia ;and consumption fol\nlow often in the wake of the often\nneglected \'cold,\' when the resistive\npowers of the body are at their low\nest eb," declares Dr. Neufif, Philadel\nphia\'s director of public health, in a\nbulletin. "One of the best preven\n! tives against tuberculosis," Dr. Neff\nadds, "is robust health, which gives\ngreat resistive power to the disease;\nand one of the first signs of de\npreciation in health is fatigue. Al\nthough this, with other minor ail\nments, may seem of slight import\nance, yet it is frequently the fore\nrunner of more serious conditions.\nIf \'colds\' were less commonly neg\nlected, many cases of consumption\nwould be discovered and cure effected\nbefore tjhe tcontajjjous stage was\nreached, and pneumonia and man>\nallied diseases would be prevented.\'\nCLASSIFIED COLUMN\nOne-half Cent a Word\nFound Notices Free.\nFor Sale?A young mare; gentle j\ndriver.

President R. H. \'Pennings\npresided and Mr. H. C. Wannamaker\nacted as secretary.\nHon. Samuel Dibble was requested\n...to state the object of the meeting\nhere Wednesday, he being familiar\ni with the details, having been one of\nthe prime movers in having it held\niere. After a hearing from Dr. Dib\nble it was decided that the Chamber\nof Commerce give a luncheon on\nWednesday evening for the entertain\nment of the gentlemen who may at\n; tend the meeting.\nIn his talk Dr. Dibble outlined\nt the ideal route, and we believe it\nwill be the one that will be adopted.\nA full description of this route was\ngiven a short time ago by Dr. Dib\nble In a letter to Hon. James Cos\ngrove, of Charleston, which letter\nwas published last week in The\nTimes and Democrat. This route\n\' takes in neary all the smaller\ntowns between this city and Charles\nton and to our mind is the. best one\nyet named.\nIn anticipation of the action of\nthe Chamber of Commerce in giving\n\'. a luncheon to the delegates. Presi\ndent Jiennings had requested Col.\nW. G. Smith, Capt. B. H. Moss and\nMr. P. M. Smoak to call on the busi\nness men and solicit funds, for the\nluncheon. This committee reported\nthat they had been met on all sides\nj with smiles and that the money was\nmost cheerfully given by all upon\ni whom they called. The amount col\nlected was $186.\nIt was determined that the enter\ntainment should . be in the form of\n? a luncheon at the Elks Hail on\nWednesday evening. It is expected\nthat about two hundred will attend,\nand provision will be made for that\nnumber. It will be an informal af\n. fair, with no set toasts, but there\nwill be several talks on good roads,\nthe best automobile route, and other\nTopics of that kind.

Mr. Livingston having an\nidea who the guilty parties were se\ncured a search warrant from Magis\ntrate J. B. Sheppard at Livingston\nwith the hope of recovering his\ngoods. Magistrate Sheppard secur\ned the services of T. .W...^atts and\nConstable^ -S. J. Reed to serve the\n.\'warrant. .".These officers.\'armed/with\nthe search warrant, were soon upon\ntrack-of the .thieves and tracked the\nmule and wagon in the., direction of\nthe North Edisto river swamp.\nUpon entering the Bwamp, the of\nficers discovered what seemed to be\nan old-fashioned moonshine still, and\nupon Investigation the barrel .of\nsyrup taken from Mr. Livingston\'s\npremises, with a good portion of the\ncontents removed, was found. Three\nfull barrels of sour mash ready to be\nmanufactured into blind tiger liquor\nalso were found. This the officers\npoured upon the ground) and re\nturned a portion of the syrup, which\nwas left in the barrel, to Mr. Liv\ningston.\nThe officers again took up the\ntrail of the mule and wagon and\ntracked same to a house near the\nriver swamp, where one of the in\nmates told the story of the theft.\nNo arrests have been made, owing\nto the absence of Magistrate -Baggott\nfrom town. Upon the return of the\nmagistrate warrants will be issued\nfor several parties.\n\' WANTS HIGHER RATE.\nBranchville and Bowman-Road Pe\ntition Commission.\nThe Branchville and Bowman Rail\nroad, which runs from Bowman\' to\nBranchville, a distance x>f . about\neleven miles, has petitioned the rail\nroad commission for an increase in\nfreight rates. The line is the only\nnarrow-gage road in the State. Mit\ntle and Shuler being the lessees of\nthe line. An increase Is asked for\ncotton seed in carload lots and on:\ncotton. The present rate on cotton\nseed is 60 cents per ton,-carload,\nand on cotton 7 cents per 100 pounds\nfor 10 miles and under and 10 cents\nfor 15 miles and over 10.\nThey are asking the commission\nto-allw them to charge 10 cents\nper 100 pounds on cotton for any\ndistance on their road and $1 per\nton for cotton seed per car load lot\nand $1.25 per ton less than carload\nlot, which includes transfer charges\nat Branchville. It is asked by the\nroad that they be permitted tc F.\ncharge 60 cents per ton for cotton\nseed hulls in bulk as transfer charg\nes at Branchville.\nThe Branchville and Bowman\nroad, being a narrow-gauge and\nshipments passing between points on\nthat line and points on other loads\nof the State, necessarily have to be\ntransferred at Branchville. This, of\ncourse, makes the handling of freight\nmore expensive. At the present\nrate the lessees find it hard to keep\nthe road in proper fix and pay run\nning expenses.\nWant the Forfeit Back.\nIt will be remembered that back\nin 1906 Mr. L. J. Timmons, of New\nYork, put up a forfeit of $500 to\nguarantee that the South Carolina\nPublic Service Corporation would\nbuild a trolley line from Ferguson\nthrough this city to North. On the\nother band, tbe Business Men\'s\nLeague put up a like sum guar\nanteeing to help the said corpora\ntion- in getting a. charter in this city\nand rights of way through the. coun\ntry. The money was put in tbe\nPeople\'s Bank, where it has since-re\nmained. Friday evening Mr. L. M.\nPinckney, of Charleston, appeared be\nfore the Chamber of Commerce,\nwhich is a successor to the Business\nMen\'s League, and asked that the\nmoney put up by Mr. Timmons be\nrebated to that gentleman. After\nsome discussion the matter was re\nferred to the executive committee\nof the Chamber of Commerce for ac\ntion.\nMay Be Built Yet.\nMr. L. M.

When first arrested she\ntold a cock and bull story about\nbeing connected with a band of ne\ngro men, who stole the goods that,\nwere found in her possession.\nSome credence was at first placed\nin this statement, but when it be\ncame apparent that 6he hoped by\nmaking this charge and assisting,\nas she offered to do, the ofllcers in\napprehending the robber band, to\nobtain immunity, the batteries were\nturned upon her with the result that\nthere were found by her oonfession\nunder the steps of different resi\ndences in the city, where...she had\nhid them, numerous pieces of jew\nlery and different articles of cloth\ning, which she had stolen from peo\nple in this city. ?\nAmong other things there was\nfound a very pretty watch with\ndistinguishing marks upon it, and\nalso the pictures of a boy and girl\npasted in the back case. This she\ni,ai?) she had lobtained jin Tampa\nor Jacksonville, Fla., from her male\npartners In crime. But to her un\ndoing, Chief Fischer happened to be\nexhigiting the watch to a few small\nboys, when one of them, young\nMooreman, exclaimed, "Why, that is\nmy picture, and the other is my lit\ntle cousin." And upon investiga\ntion the watch was found to- be the\nproperty of Mrs. Mooreman, residing\non Sellers avenue. There was also\na stick pin belonging to Mrs. Moore\nman, recovered.\nWhile the woman is a stranger\nhere, there is little doubt that all\nthe articles found in her possession\nwere stolen In this city, and efforts\nare being made to have them identi\nfied. Already three or four cases\nfor burglary\'and larceny have\'*been\'\nmade out against her by her own\nconfession. The prisoner is appar\nently twenty-five years old, dark\nginger cake color, medium size, and\nwears "bushy" hair, the natural hair\nbeing augmented by numerous\n"rats," which give her an unnatural\nappearance.\nShe is very sullen, and gives the\nImpression that she has "been there\nbefore." She offered to put up $100\nfor here release, though no money\nwas foun on her person. She may\nbe operating, as she first said, with\na band of male thieves, whose head\nquarters are in Charleston. She fur\nther stated that she had pledged in\nCharleston several watches entrust\ned to her, and that one of the men\n? a tall, black man?Keitt by nam?\n?accompanied her to this city. She\nwill be held for further examina\ntion, and until thorough investiga\ntion can be made hfere and else\nwhere, after which she will be turned\nover to a magistrate under warrants\nwhich will be sworn out.\nBeatrice is an accomplished liar,\nas well as an accomplished thief, and\nthere is little if any dependence to\nbe put in what she says. It would\nbe well, however, to. investigate her\ntale about that band of robbers.\nSuch bands have existed not a thou\nsand \'miles from Orangeburg. Be\natrice would enter homes and rob\nthem while the inmates of the home\nwere present. In one instance at\nleast this was the ca^e, and the peo\nple of the house did not know they\nhad been robbed until they wore\ntold about it. The chances are that\nBeairice will be sent up for a term\nof years for her many thefts. The\npolice will get returns from other\ncities about this clever thief.\' There\nare yet in possession of Chief\nFischer a number of pieces of ladies\'\nlingerie, some of them very pretty\nand costly.\nAutumn.\nWe dreamed, perchance, when the\nyear was young,\nWe played in the golden light,\nAs we watched the sunset shadows\nflung.\nOn the starry dome of night.\nWe knew no voice of the fiery clond\nOr wail of the wind as it moaned\naloud\nFar over the stricken woods.\nThe year is dying, the leaves arc\nlaid\nIn gold-red drifts at our feet;\nOf fading fancy our dreams were\nsweet.\nSo let winter threaten and life be\ndrear.\nIn our hearts there whispers a mes\nsage clear?\nThe hope of the coining spring.\n?Donald Corrie in Westminster Ga\nzette.\nThe Fakir Au<".\nThis . supposed to be .\': scien\ntifir and practical ag<\\ and as such\nto be far above charlatanry and Im\nposture. Yet it is doubtful if\nfakirs, mediums and other such\ncharacters ever flourished more\nthan they now do. Perhaps or\\n of\nthe most conspicuous of th\'ese is the\npossibly self-deluded W. T. St--ad, oi\nLondon, who profuses to have com\nmunication with a spirit whom b"\ncalls "Julia." This fair spirit has\nbeen telling Stead about interviews\nshe says she has had with Glad\nstone, but the language ascribed to\nGladstone is very like Stead\'s own.\nAnd anyway Gladstone seems to have\ndegenerated in the other world which\nis not much of an encouragement\nfor people who want to go there. <\nNEWS FROM BOWMAN.\nThe Auto Good Road Movement\nBeing Discussed Freely.\nBowman, Dec. 3:?Special. Well,\nthe auto highway is almost all the\ntalk in this section now, and roads\nare being patched up as fast as prac\nticable along the main line in this\ncounty. If all of the township\ncommissioners along the proposed\nroute would take the interest that\nHon. Samuel Dibble is displaying in\nthe work it would soon terminate in\ncomplete success. Good roads aud\ngood schools go band in band for\nthe successful building up of any\ntown, and it is gratifying to state\nthat there seems to be a waking up\nalong this line. The times demand\nit; the sooner the better.\nCotton Shipments.\nThe sale of cotton "is going at\nquite a slow pace now, and the same\nis getting to be the case with cotton\nseed, too.

All the re\nports showed the c?nrregation in\nfine shape. When a little balance\ncollected from some of the members\nwho have not paid up in full yet, all\nthe financial claims will have been\npaid in full.
