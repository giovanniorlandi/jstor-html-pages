        <pre>['Catôuidl Sfcibtme.\nVOL 28. NO. 41\nCALDWELL, IDAHO. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 29, igo8\nWEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR\nSTATE\nLAND BOARD\nMAKESJOOD SHOWING\nEverything Appears to be in Good Shape\nTHE REPORT OF THE REGULAR SHOWS WISE AND ECONOMICAL\nMANAGEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT---IM\nMENCE BUSINESS TRANSACTED.\nTo the Honorable State Board of\nLand Commissioners, Boise, Idaho.\nGentlemen:\nI have the honor to submit here\nwith a report of the State land de\npartment for the year 1907, show\ning a summary of the receipts and\nthe disposal made of the same. Also\na comparative statement of the busi\nness transacted by this department\nprior to January 1, 1905—a period\nof fourteen years from the organi\nzation of this department, and the\nbusiness transacted from January 1,\n1905, to January 1, 1908—a period\nof three years.\nThe eighth session of the Idaho\nlegislature provided by enactment for\nthe organization of the State Land\nDepartment. The State Board of\nLand Commissioners have since been\nworking under that law, and the de\npartment, it is felt, Is thoroly reor\nganized on a business basis. At\npresent the affairs of the state land\ndepartment are conducted with the\nexactness of a great banking institu\ntion. As in a wisely administered\nbank, the books are balanced every\nnight at the close of business, the\nreceipts are quickly reinvested, and a\ncareful accounting is made of ex\npenditures.\nThe records of the land depart\nment are now in perfect condition.\nThe special grants of land by Con\ngress for various objects, which ag\ngregated 668,080 acres, have prac\ntically all been secured, there\nmaining only 60 acres still unselect\ned.\nA successful campaign looking to\nthe leasing of school lands for graz\ning and agricultural purposes has\nbeen waged. The selection of lands\nin indemnity for losses in the com\nmon school grant is being prosecuted\nwith success, and it is hoped that by\nthe end of the present year the ex\nisting indemnity losses will have\nbeen practically satisfid.\nThe total cash receipts of the land\ndepartment of the thirteen months\nending January 1, 1908, was $1,173,\n120.52. Of the amount $567,095.92\nwas by reason of repayment of in\nvestments, and $606,024.60 on ac\ncount of land and timber, interest on\ndeferred payment, rentals, interests\non investments, Carey Act and land\noffice fees, tc. The cost of conduct\ning the department during the year\n1907, was $27,561.85.\nOn January 1, 1908, the invest\nment account showed that the de\npartment in possession of state war\nrants, bonds, and farm loans, aggre\ngating $2,075,686.05. In addition\nthere was an unpaid balance on ac\ncount of land sales of $1,534,029.76.\nTHE ALUMNI TO\nTO RAISE MONEY\nAt a recent meeting of tho alum\nni association of the College of Idaho\nIt was decided that the organization\nwould raise $10,000.00 for the pur- J\npose of erecting an alumni memorial\nhall. This, with tho $125,000.00 |\nalso to be raised by others will make\nthe College of Idaho one of the lead\ning educational institutions in the\nnorthwest. The alumni plan Is to ^\nhave each graduate of the College\npledge himself for from $50.00 up.\nThe amount each subscribee will be\npaid in 5 annual instalments. It is\nbelieved that the money can be rais\ned easily. The graduates are taking\na lively Interest In the growth and\ndevelopment of the College. They\nrealize that it Is possible by an earn\nest eflord to make the College the\nleading educational institution of the\nWest. Circumstances are auspicious.\nThe alumni are to bo congratulated\nupon their enterprise and college\nspirit.\nThese deferred payments draw inter-1\nest at the rate of 6% per annum. The\nactual investmenl of funds drawing\ninterest on January 1, 1908, was,\nconsequently, $3,609,715.81.\nDuring 1907 there were sold of\nspecial grant lands, 8,877.91 acres\nfor $101,568.01, and of common\nschool lands, 18,238.60 acres, for\n$261,831.65. During the year 46,\n555.96 acres were leased five years,\nrentals \'collected amounting to $9,\n879.88, and 15,234.29 acres for one\nyear, rental collected amounting to\n$3,251.10. Timber on 20,677.30\nacres of State land was sold\nfor $250,362.30. The policy\nof the department in the sale\nof timber has been to dispose\nof only scattered tracts, likely to "loss |\nby fire. The large bodies of timber\nlands have been held intact.\nDuring 1907 the State selected In\nsatisfaction of its special grants and\nconmon chool land losses 31,520\nacres, all but 2500 acres being In\ndemnity selections,\nFor the purpose of showing some\nof the advantages that have result\ned from the reorganization of the de\npartment under the law of 1905, the\nfollowing comparison of the work of\nthe State land department from Janu\nary 1, 1891 to January 1, 1905\nfourteen years, and from January 1,\n1905 to January 1, 1908\nyears, are submitted.\nDuring the fourteen years prior to\nJanuary 1, 1905, there were selec\nted of the special grants, 638,474.89\nacres. Common school land indem\nnity selections aggregated 6,175.80\nacres—a total of 644,650.69 acres, or\nan average selection per year of 46,\n000 acres. In the three years prior\nto January 1, 1908, of the special\ngrants there were selected 30,496.\n70 acres, and of indemnity lands\n223,301.63 acres—an average selec\nt.ion of 84,500 acres a year. On that\ndate there remained to be selected\n60\n•three j\nacres of the special grants and I\n467,524.36 acres of common school]\nland losses.\nDuring the fourteen year period !\nending January 1, 1905, there was j\nsold by the State 91,400 acres for\n$1,306,568.37. In the past three)\nyears sales of State land have aggre\ngated 72,694.87 acres for $1,128,- I\n327.65. Timber on 136,831.85 acres\nof State land was sold during the\nfirst fourteen years for $699,820.21\nan average of $5.11 an acre. Dur\nIng the last three years timber sales\nhave been from 36,137.88 acres—for\n$473,134.27—an average of $13.09\nan acre.\nThe earnings o fthe land depart\nment from January 1, 1891 to Janu\nary 1. 1905, were $477,638.45, from\nSHEEPMEN OWN\nTHE SALT PUNT\nThere seems to be a mlsunder\nstnding among tho sheep men as to\nw jj 0 owns the salt plant 01 the As\nsociation.

Lowell and also the pro\nposed Act of Congress granting leave\nof absence to bona fide settlers un\nder the national reclamation law. The\nproposed law will grant leave of ab\nsence to bona fide settlers who have\nmade substantial Improvements. The\nletter is in reply to a remonstrance\nsent Senator Heyburn. Tho questions\nnaturally arising are what will con\nstitute substantial improvements\nand what are bona fide settlers. We\ncannot see how It can be determined\nwhether a settler is acting in good\nfaith or not, except In the usual man\nner. It is well known that the\nusual speculator Is much better able\nto make substantial improvements\nthan the ordinary homesteader. The\nTribune cannot see that the proposed\nI law meels the requirements. How\n!\nj\never, it will do considerable good\nThe letter and law follows: ,\nFebruary 21, 1908.\nMr. J. H.

The Tribune re\nporter went on an exploring expe\ndition early in the week and spent\nabout six hours in Boise—and he has\nbeen yawning ever since. Philadel\nphia has the false and felonian rep\nutation of being the deadest city in\nthe nation, but it bears the same re\ntion to Boise in its present condition\nthat the latter does to ancient Nlne\nvah.\nDr. J.

It will be required that\nall children attending school must be\nvaccinated. The officers can not be\ntoo vigilant in this matter even tho\nthe cases are light. It is reported\nthat there was several cases of scar\nlet fever in the vicinity of the experi\nment farm, yet the cases were not\nreported to the health officer. The\nlaw is strict, anyone failing to report\ncontagious diseases lay themselves\nopen to fine and Imprisonment.\nIS FATALLY SDDT\nWas Quarreling With McGrevey When Shot\nL AYER GIVES HIMSELF UP, AT HEARING HE IS BOUND OVER\nCHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER. BAIL OF\n$5000.00 IS FURNISHED.\nAt eleven o\'clock Monday fore\nnoon W. G. Whitney waa shot and\nkilled by J. M. McGrevey on a rauch\nbelonging to Mr. Whitney and which\nMoGrevev had rented last year, lo\ncated near Fruitlaud, and upon\nwhich McGrevey aud a force of men\nwere baling hay at the time of the\nkilling. Then were three eye wit\nnesses to the affair, F D. James, h\nwell known resident ot Washoe, his\nsou, Basil James and his son-in-law,\nFrank Uott, Mr. James being the\nprincipal witness as be alone seems\nto have a lucid «ocount of the affair\nthe other two not b«ing in a position\nat tbe time to witness all that hap,\npened. Aocordiug to the story of\nMr. James he had been bired to bale\nthe hay upon the place, by Mr. Mc\nGrevey and moved his baler into the\nfield and began work Mouday morn\ning. About ten o\'clock Whituoy\ndrove into the field and ordered\nhim to quit baling, stating that tbe\nhay belonged to him. After giving\nthis order Whitney drove away aud\nJames drove to the McGrevey home a\nshort distance away aud informed\nMcGrevey of the Incident and to\ngetber they retunred to the field aud\nairain began to bale the bay, Mc\nGrevey stating the hay was his and he\nwould bale it. At eleven o\'clock\nWhitney again returned accompanied\nby U. M. Sutfin aud driving his team\nup to the power in suoh a manuer us\nto stop the team at work on the baler\naud again demanded that they cease\noperations. McGrevey walked over\nbehind the team attached to tbe\nbaler horse power aud hitting them\nwith a fork remarked that "the hay\nbelonged to him and he would bale\nit." The team shied by the team\nWhitney was driving aud started\nup. Jumping from the buggy\nWhitney by throwing up his bauds\nand shouting attempted to stop tbe\nteam and following a*.ound tbe\npower started towards MGreyey with\nhis right band in his coat pocket.\nIn his statement of the affair James\nsays that at this voint McGrevey\nstarted to run and Whitney took\nafter him chasing him around the\npower baler with bis hand in his\nright coat pocket, carrying a club\nwhich he had picked up in his left\nbaud. McGrevey ran around the\npower and back towards the baler and\njumping over the end of the baler\nstarted to go around the hay stack\nb\'lt finding himself olosely pressed\nturned and pulling bis revolver shot.\nThe revolver used was au automatic\nColts of 32 calibre and all of the\nwitnesses are unable to state accur\nately as to the number of shots but\nthink that three were fired.\nDropping the club he carried\nWhitney walked to his wagou and\nclimbed in, giving no sign tbat he\nSEN. HEYBURN\nSTATES POSITION\nSenator Heyburn has received a\nnumber of letters in regard to legis\nlation effecting dry farming which in\ndicate that his position on this sub\nject is not thoroly understood. It\nis well known that Senator Heyburn\nwas one of the pioneers in this sort\nof legislation, and the following let\nter to the Register of the State Land\nBoard explains his position fully:\nUnited States Senate, Washington,\nD. C., February 18th, 1908.\nM. I. Church, Esq.,\nRegister, State Land Board,\nBoise, Idaho.\nMy Dear Sir:\nYour letter of February 11th Is\njust received and I note what you\nsay with reference to the sentiment\nin regard to dry farming. The area\n(320 acres) proposed by the Smoot\nbill was never a matter of serious\nconsideration. The question that in\nterested me most was that of non\nresident ownership and I had the\nbill amended in this particular. I am\nwilling that the citizens of Idaho\nwas mortally wounded other than\ntuiniug slightly pale. Starting to\ndrive away ho not a distance of about\nseventy-five feet and turning in the\nsent again admonished McGrevey uot\nto bale any more bay. With thia\ncommand he collapsed in tbe seat of\ntbe wagon.\nH. M. Sutfin who was with him in\nthe wagon called on the men present\nfor help aud with the assistance of\nFrank Goff took bim to the home of\nCbap Williams near by.\nDr. I. Woodward was summoned\nat once and arrived at the Williami\nhome at about 12:30. Mr. Whitney\nwas conscious when the doctor ar\nriven and remained conscious until\nthe very last, dying about 1 :30 p. m.\nIn his examination Dr. Woodward\nfound that two shots had taken effeutiji\none in the left shoulder and one in\nthe abdomen.\nImmediately after the shooting\nMcGrevey and James bitched up a\nteam aud coming to town MtGrevey\nsurrendered himself to Justice\nDriacoll who gave him in charge\nof Constable Cosman\nThere are many rumors afloat con\ncerning the shooting and it seems\ntho two men have had trouble con\ncerning laud which McGrevey first\nrented from Whitney and later\nbought, and also over the division of\nthe hay grown on the pieoe of land\nwhere tbe trouble occurred as this\nland had been rented on tbe shares.\nThe testimony ot the witnesses ex\namined at the coroner\'s inquest oor\nroborated th« story as told by Mr.\nJames.\nMcGrevey was arraigned in Justice\nDriscoll\'s court on Wednesday even\ning for a preliminary bearing and\nwas bound over to tbe district court\non a charge of manslaughter his\nbonds being fixed at $5,000. At tbe\ntime of going to press Mr. McGrevey\nwas arranging to give bail in the\namount named.—Payette Enterprise.\nW. G. Whitney was well known in\nCanyon county, having been engaged\nin the nuisery buisness with a\nbrother wbo died in 1891, after\nwhich W. G. continued tbe buisness\nuntil he closed it out. It is estima\nted that bis estate will invqioe\n$200,000. William Ireton, who lor\nmany vars lived a near neighbor tto\nthe deceased says that he carried\n$20,000 life insurance. Of recmt*\nyears the Whituey residence has been\nat Seaside, Oregon, and Boise. His\nwife and an adopted daugbtoi survive\nbim.\nShort funeral services were held\nat the residence of Captain Irwin\nafter which tbe remains were shipped\nto Walla Walla, Oregon. A largs\nconcourse of friends and neighhors\nof he ddeceased followed the remains\nto tbe station.\nshould have a very liberal deal on\nIdaho lands for the purpose of cul\ntivation or residence, and I realize\nthe impracticability of requiring resi\ndence on the class of lands covered\nby the Smoot bill. Those who dif\nfered with me seem to have sent out\nstatements that were not warranted\nby the facts in regard to my position.\nI am of Lite opinion that two hundred\nand forty acres would be sufficient,\nand think even less might be suffi\ncient, but inasmuch as no residence\nis required the original burdens of\nhomestead entry do not fall on those\ntaking this land, to wit: building\nhomes, barns, cross fences, etc., and\nwe can well afford to be liberal with\nthese people. I was unalterably op\nposed to lands in Idaho being taken\nup by people never Intending to be\ncome residents of the State who\nwould take the proceeds of the crops\nwhich they raise to some distant sec\ntion ot the country for ejpendlture\nand enjoyment.\nI am glad to have your letter and\nwish you would make it plain that\nmy opposition was oaäed upon the\nnon -resident feature of the measure.\nI do not care to have the long arm\nof the non-residents reaching over\nI Continued ou page 5', 'ÎTljç ftdbmtc\nOALDWtLL, IDAHO\nrUHUSHKD BY\nDAVIS & BARNETT\nSubscription,\n$2.00 Per Annum\nWKMCLY ESTABLISHED DEC. 8. 1HH3\nand f iltered at the Caldwvll Postoftice as\nqecon l-class matter.—Act of Marth 3, 1879\nADVERTISING RATES\nDisplay advertising 1"!<£c inch per issue\nReading notices, 10c per line.\nClassified advertisements, 1c per word\nper issue.\nLEGAL NOTICES\nKin-ii Proof Notices I 7.50\nCon ;est Notices 10 00\nNoti^/e to Creditors 5.00\nNot Ve Proving Will 5.00\nAli« Summons 12.00\nAll other Leçal Notices $1.00 per inch;\n(solid nonpareil) per issue first insertion ;\n60c per incn each subsequent insertion.\nThe Company will absolutely recognize\nno other prices, withoutcontract.no matter\nby whom made.\nSENTIMENT GROWING.\nThere can be no question in the\nminds of intelligent men and women,\nirrespective of church or party, but\nthat the sentiment in favor of the\nprohibition of the sale and manufac\nture of alcoholic liquors in any form,\nIs growing. The people of this coun\ntry are determined that this traffic\nIn human souls must cease. No mat\nter what the personal Inclinations of\nthe man may be, he can not help but\nrecognize the evil. No matter how\ndegraded the man may be, he still\ndesires to free his sons from this con\ntaminating curse. Even the saloon\nman hates the trade he plies. It in\nan unmixed evil—damnable to the\nman and a curse to society. It bati\ncaused more sorrow and suffering on\nearth than all other evils. The Amer\nican people are commencing to appre\nciate the price they are paying. They\nare beginning to realize the lact that\nthe only solution lies in the prohi\nbition of the sale and manufacture of\nliquors. The prohibition of its man\nufacture Is still to come. It may be\ntwenty or thirty years before It is\nrealized. But coming It Is. It can\nnot be long delayed. We think that\nwithin ten years It will be practically\naccomplished. We know that within\nten years Its sale will ba so encom\npassed, that It will be Impossible for\nmen to freely Indulge in liquor. The\npeople of the country believe In prohi\nbition and they are willing to give\nit a trial. They are doing so In many\nparts today. We think the people\nof Idaho are ready to try It. The\nRepublicans—the dominant party —\nshould be tho first to come out on\nthis proposition. As a Republican we\nbelieve that the problems of Idaho\nwill be solved thru the instrumental\nity of that organization. Aa a Re\npublican we urge other Republicans\nto take up this work. It will re\nflect credit upon the parcy aad one«\nagain sho-^ the people that Chat par\nty which freed Amerlcal from hu\nman bondage can also fre? the peo\nple from moral slavery.\nDUBOIS WILL CONTROL.\nIn the vernacular of the street it\nIs almost a cinch that Snator Dubois\nwill control th« next Democratic con\nvention. The senator la undoubtedly\nthe ablest man in the Democratic\nparty. He will go to the Democratic\nNational Convention at the head of\nthe Idaho delegation. He will be\nroyally welcomed by Bryaa nnd his\nfriends. He will secure their en\ndorsement and an anti-Mormon\nplank in the National platform, and\nthen what will his Democratic ene\nmies do? Will they repudiate Bryan?\nWe wot not Will they jeapordizo\nthe euccesa of the ticket by a fac\ntional flfhc" We wot rhv> same way\nThe senator will have it all hia own\nway. \'Ie will make »ivo.ul persons\nthink darn it We st\'ll wot.\nBOSSES AND BOSSISM.\nElsewhere in this issue of The Tri\nbune appears an editorial from the\nCaldwell News in regard to "Bosslsin"\nas viewed by the Capital News. Ac\ncording to the Capital News, the\nDemocratic delegation from Canyon\nCounty, who sought one of the Dem\nocratlc conventions, occupied a most\nhumiliating position. They were forc\ned to bow down and worship Senator\nDubois, and even then didn\'t get the\noonvention. It seemed to The Trib\nune that the Canyon County delega\ntlon, which visited Senator Dubois,\nwas perfectly right and acted with\ndignity and self-respect. They con\nsulted with the Sentor, he was the\nleading Democrat of the State; and\nwould, no doubt, exercise some con\nsiderable influence in naming the\nplace at which the next Democratic\nconvntlon would be held. We can\'t\nsee anything wrong in that, but then\nwe can\'t understand the inside work\nings of the Democratic mind. The\ngentlemen who composed the dele\ngation will, undoubtedly, feel highly\nllattered at the comment showered\nupon them by the Capital News. Tney\nwill feel highly honored when rep\nresented as lackeys prostituting\nthemselves and their party for a con\nvention. But It is a Democratic t?crup\nand let mirth be unconüned.\nA recent arrival is the Filer In\ndependent, independent in politics,\nbut first, last and all iLe \'.ima for\nFiler. It is situated in the best\nstate in the Union, and it thinks in\nthe best part of that State. There\ncan be no doubt, but that Flier is a\ncoming city. The Independent is\nbran new and newsy. It seems to be\nwell patronized, and certainly de\nserves its patronage. We hope the\nIndependent will become a good Re\npublican paper and prosper.\nOn of the latest papers to reach\nour desk is the Malad Telegram, pub\nlished by Mr. Uther Jones. The\nTelegram says it is in line with the\n"old guard." We would admonish\nthe Telegram to steer clear of the\n"old guard" unless It has been re\nbaptized. The \'\'old guard" can stand\na ducking several times a year. How\never, the Telegram Is a bright, newsy\npaper. It is well edited, neat In\ntypographical appearance and brim\nful of news. We wish It success.\nThe Capital News cannot but argue\na liar so It confesses. If the Capital\nNews can\'t make a decent showing\nagainst liars how can it expect to do\nmuch against the truth? On the one\nor two occasions, in its career, when\nthe News was right, it certainly did\nmake a sorry showing. We can\'t see\nthat the NewB has added greatly\nto its reputation.\nThe Capital News don\'t know how\nbig a scoundrel The Tribune is. After\nassociating and participating with\nscoundrels as lond as the News has,\nit ought to be a fairly good judge of\nscoundrels. We would hate to con\nfess such Ignorance, if we had had\nthe experience of the Capital Nws.\nHEYBURNS POSITION\n(Continued from Frrt Page)\nthe borders of Idaho for profits tl\nbe made In Idaho, but I do b«lieve\nin everybody who is making a home\nin Idaho having the benefits of dry\nfarming If they choose to engage In\nit. With the immense water supply\nwhich can be reservoired at a great\nelevation in Idaho, In my judgment\nthe day is not far distant when any\nlands in the State may be under wa\nter. Length of ditches or pipe lines\nseems to be no longer a serious ob\nstacle. I was one of the first advo\ncates of dry farming legislation and\nstand ready to do everything I can\nto promote it along certain lines. Be\ncause I am In favor of dry farming\nit does not follow that I would favor\nevery bill that professes to be in the\nInterest of dry farming. We should\nlook beyond the present in such mat\nters, which are of vital interest to\nour State.\nSincerely yours,\nW. B.

This decision\nwas arrived at after careful consider\nation by the big plow company and\njust a straw which Indicate« the way\nthe commercial wind is blowing. The\n(act that Caldwell Is being recognized\nas a financial and business center re\nquires no further proof than that big\ncommercial concerns are making this\ncity their distributing point for the\nState.\nCurious Corn Facts.\nFew people realize what even a lit\ntle Improvement in corn culture mans\nDuring 1906 the United States grew\nninety-five million acres of corn. Th:s\narea produced 2,880,000,000 bushels\nof corn, worth in round numbers $1,\n300,000,000. By simply adding one\nkernel to each ear you add $1,620,000\nto the returns from this area produc\ning corn.\nThis increase is infinitesimal in it\nself and very few farmers who have\nadopted Improved methods, or used\npure-bred seed, will admit that less\nthan two to three bushels per acre\ncan be secured. Figure a little fur\nther. As stated above, in 1906 the\ncorn crop covered ninety-five million\nacres. By increasing the yield one\nbushel to the acre, and figuring this\nat forty-five cents a bushel, the total\nvalue of the corn crop is Increased\n$42,750,000; by Increasing the yield\ntwo bushels, $85,500,000; three\nbushels, $128,250,000; four bushels,\n$171,000,000; five bushels, the stu\npendous sum of $213,750,000.\nThe economic possibilities of the\ncorn plant are almost unlimited. At\nthe National Corn Exposition which\nwas held In Chicago, October 5 to 19,\n1907, one of the most Interesting ex\nhibits was that of household articles\nmade from corn. This consisted of\nrugs, portieres, table covers, mats,\npicture frames, etc., made from the\ncorn plant.\nMore than five hundred thousand\nacres of unproductive swamp land\nwithin a radius of three hundred\nmiles of Chicago can be made great\ncorn fields; first by drainage, and,\nsecond, by the application of potash\nphosphorus or both. The first\nnamed element is usually the one\nmost needed and can be applied at a\ncomparatively small cost. That these\nwaste areas will eventually become\ngreat corn fields is almost certain.\nTrue, they will grow truck crops, but\nany considerable increase in the area\ndevoted to truck will render the busi\nness unprofitable by glutting the mar\nket. The ever-increasing demand for\ncorn will almost absorb any extra\narea without any appreciable effect\nupon the market. Land which no"v\ngrows nothing can, at a cost of a few\ndollars an acre, be made to produce\nannual crops of from sixty to eighty\nbushels per acre. This has been defl\nnitely demonstrated during the last\nfew years by at least three experl\nment stations in the Middle West and\nhundreds of practical farmers.\nAbout one-third of all the land un\nder cultivation In the United States\nis devoted to corn. It is grown on\nninety per cent ot all the farms in the\ncountry. It is worth more than two\nand one-half times the wheat crop\nthe grain second in importance.\nNo grain lends itself so readily to\nscientific investigation and improve\nment as does corn. About twelve\nyears ago the agricultural experiment\nstations began to appreciate this, and\ntoday no study is as popular as the\nstudy of corn. Almost every State\nhas its corn-growers\' associations,\nand all corn states have annual corn\nschools, annual judging contests, and\nschools of instruction for expert\njudges.—Saturday Evening Post.\nProgressive Cinch.\nFriday night of last week about\n40 of the friends and neighbors of\nMr. and Mrs. A. J. Rockwood\nof Roswell met at their res\nidence for an evening of pleas\nure. The Roswell people are\nnoted for their sociability and this\nevent was no exception.
