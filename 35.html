General\nCrowder, acting judge advocate\ngeneral of the army, has giren an\nopinion that the t federal govern\nment can not interfere with the\nmilitia authorities of the state of\nTexas in the establishment of a\ncanteen for the sale of beer and\nlight wines on the camp grounds\nnear Austin, on the occasion of the\njoint maneuvers of regular and\nmilitia troops beginning about the\nfirst of August. It is clear that\nthe regular troops can not legally\nestablish a canteen of the character\ndescribed at the camp in question;\nbut it is held that there is nothing\nin the law to prevent the militia\nmen from so doing, provided that\nsuch action does not conflict with\nthe laws of the state.\nk It is admitted that if the United\nStates troops were in sole oc\ncupancy of the camp grounds, the\ncommanding officer ; should be\nauthorized, to prohibit the sale of\nbeer or cither intoxicating liquor on\nthe grounds. The secretary of war\nhas approved the opinion. The\ncanteen at Austin is presumably\nfor the exclusive benefit of the\nmilitiamen of Texas, but it is not\nregarded as probable that those m\ncharge will refuse to extend "the\nusual courtesies" to thirsty sol\ndiers. The canteen question has\nnot arisen with any of the other\nsix joint encampments. The camp\nat Mount Gretna, Pa-, is on leased\nground within the jurisdiction of\nthe Keystone State, an analogous\ncondition to that of Texas.

The road as now\nplanned will extend from Santa\nAna in Salvador to the extension\nof the Puerto Barrios branch of a\nline already projected for .the trav\nersing of Guatemala which is to\nconnect with the Pan-American\nline at Tapachula. At present,\npending the end of the revolution\nin Guatemala, everything is at a\nstandstill in railway construction.\nbut the moment this is settled the\nwork will be commenced. Every\nthing has been settled in Guate\nmala and the lines there are all ar\nranged for with liberal subsidies\npromised.\nThe part of the Pan-American\nline in Mexico which is now being\noperated is reported to be paying\ndividends and this seems to indicate\nthat the road is on a firm financial\nbasis.\nTHE SUSPECT WAS RELEASED\nI\nP.

The\ntrial of the suits of the several rail\nroad of the State against the Rail\nroad Commission, attacking \' the\nwhole body of freight rates estab\nlished by- that body promises to be\none of the greatest legal battle s\never fought in Texas. The com\nplaininfi raliroads are thoroughly\nwrought up over the constant and\nserious impairment of their earnings\nthrough the reduction of freight\nrates that have been made b3T the\nRailroad Commission during the\npast two years, and they are pre\npared, it is said, to go into court\nand demonstrate all the charges\nand complaints set up in their\npetitions. The array of figures\nbearing upon the subject, which\nthe petitions contain, appear on\nthe surface to be conclusive evi\ndence that the existing rates are\nfar from compensatory. It will be\nfor the Railroad Commission to\nmake showing to the contrary.\nThe railroads in their petitions\ndo not ask that the old rates which\nwere in effect before the establish\nment of the Commission be restor\ned, but they sa that they are\nwilling to abide by the compromise\nrates which were established on\nFebruary 28, 1S99. These com\npromise rates were faithfully lived\nup to by the Railroad Commission\nas long as Judge John H. Reagan\nwas a member of that body. The\nreductions were begun after his\nretirement, and they have been so\nsweeping and unjustifiable, it is\nclaimed, as to seriously harm the\nrailroad properties of the State.\nThere are important improvements\nand extensions which the Texas\nrailroads would like to make, but\nundr the reduced earnings caused\nby the forced reduction of rates\nthey are unable to carry out these\nplans.\nIt has become a matter of gen\neral comment that the railroads are\nnpt keeping up with the general\nprogress of development and\ngrowth of the State in the matter\nof enlarging their systems and in\nbuilding new lines into territory\nthat under better rate conditions\nwould be looked upon as inviting.\nINTERVIEW WITH HERALD MAN\nFt.\nWorth Paper Inquires Into Political\nConditions on the Rio Grande.\nThe Fort Work Telegram of last\nMonday had the following:\nJesse O.

Wells, Jesse\nO. Wheeler knows more about pol\nitics on the border than any man\nin the Brownsville country- He\nhas built himself and the Hekald\nup to prominence in that section\nand is an authority that has weight.\nSpeaking to a Telegram reporter\nof the gubernatorial situation in the\nBrownsville country, he said un\nhesitatingly: "C.

Y. In an address be\nfore the American "Association for\nthe Advancement \' of Science in\nsession here Pro?. James Walter\nCrook of Amherst College took\nissue with President Roosevelt on\nthe\ngreat\nHe pointed out the impossibility\nof individuals hanging great for\ntunes, and then"sdtoght to show\nthat the measures proposed to limit\ngreat fortunes had;great objections.\nHe said in parti ,,\'\',f\'\n\' \'Fortunes may be considered as\nswollen beyond healthy limits\nwhich yield from $5,000,000 to\n$20,000,000 a year. Let us con\nsider the possibilities of handling\nsuch incomes. The wealthy man\nwho feels that he must pass the\nbulk of his wealth to heirs has a\ntask that has invited originality in\narrangement. A wealthy father puts\nhis \'son\'s wealth in trust till his\n32nd birthday allowing him a,\nsmall sum of $2,500 a year. An\nindulgent mother raises his income\nto $SO,000 a year. He is now a\nruined man.\n"The three methods of relief\nsometimes proposed are: An Ar\nbitrary limit to the amount an in\ndividual may accumulate; pro\ngressive taxation of incomes, and\nprogressive inheritnuce taxes.\nWhere should the limit be drawn?\nThe limitation is repressive and is\nmeant to be so: It would put a\npremium upon relative inefficiency\nand deprive society of the advan\ntage of beneficiaU\'eilterprises- A\nprogressive tax on incomes high\nenough to accomplish the purpose\naimed at has the same disadvan\ntages. There is left the progressive\ntax on inheritance:\' As a tax\nmeasure aiming) at\nprove it. It is easily\na measure to limit fortunes how\never, it seems to me more doubt\nful. To accomplish the purpose the\nrate must be very high.\n"A tax heavy enough would\ninvolve a problem of administra\ntion. Even so low a rate as 30 per\ncent would mean a tax of $15,000,\n000, for every estate of $50,000,\n000, and there are now many\nfortunes of that size, and iu the\ncase of some wellknown fortunes\nthe tax would amount to upward\nof $43,000,000. The greatest objec\ntion is the encouragement which\nthe heavy taxation of the wealthy\nwill give to extravagant public ex\npenditures. Our Federal financial\nmachinery is so organized that it\nis well nigh impossible to check\nextravagance. Greater financial\nresponsibility is one of the first re\nquirements of good government.\nIt is a maxim of public finance that\nthose who spend\' must be held to\naccount by those who pay. By\nthis plan the maxim is reversed,\nfor by it those who pay afe held\nto account by those who spend."\nGAINED $116 A MILE.\nGross Earnings of American Railroads\nHave Increased Tremendously Dur\ning the Year.\nChicago, 111.. July 12 The fiscal\nvear just closed will, it is believed,\nturn cut to be the greatest, so far\nas gross receipts are concerned ever\nexperienced by the American rail\nroads- Never before have twelve\nmouths passed consecutively in\nwhich there wJls fHitClr a constant\nflow of traffic in volume large\nenough to tax to" the utmost the\ncarrying capacity of all the roads\nin ail sections of the country.

The people have the\nbrunt to bear of all these shakings\nup, and are also responsible for the\nexistence of these bloodsuckers.\nIt is said that for the first time\nin history a man in the state of\nWashington is to receive a medal\nfor killing a fellow man. Geo.\nMitchell some time ago killed Franz\nEdruuud CrefBeld, the self-styled\n"Joshua," leader of a band of re\nligious fanatics calling themselves\nthe "Holy -Rollers." The citizens\nof Corvallis, Ore., so much appre\nciated the act of Mitchell in rid\nding their section of a howling\nnuisance they will present the med\nal.\nThe railroads of Texas claim\nthat they can show the existing\nreductions of rates have operated\nto put the roads upon an unprof\nitable basis. If this be true, it is\nonly a question of time when the\nrates will have to be raised or the\nroads closed down. Meanwhile, the\ntest of it will be made in a series\nof suits filed to enjoin all of the\nrulings of the Railroad Commis\nsion. In view or sucn a situation,\nand the further fact that the whole\nmaterial prosperity and advance\nment of Texas is bound up in the\nmaintenance and further extension\nof railroads, it does seem that- the\nanti-railroad agitation of certain\ncandidates for Governor is injurious\nto the best interests of the State.\nSan Antonio Express.\nForced Separation.\nOne of the funniest things I\nhave seen in all the time I\'ve been\non the road was the separation of\na newly married couple bv the\nbreaking of a train on the way\ndown to St. Louis a while ago\nsaid a Chicago traveling man.\nWe were going down on the\nAlton Road, and shortly before we\ngot to Springfield the inferior half\nof the newly wedded pair strolled\ninto the smoker. Flopping him\nself into a seat across the aisle from\nme, he commenced to praise the\ninnumerable virtues of his wife.\n"She was the finest little wo\nman in the world, the cleverest,\nthe handsomest, the best dressed\nand so on. And then he had to\ntell what they were going to do\nwhen they got to St. Louis. He\nbecame so excited during the nar\nration of his story that he talked\nconsiderably louder thau was nec\nessary, and every one in the car\nknew all about the woman back in\nthe parlor car. He never heard\nthe brakeman announce that the\ntrain was to be broken at Spring\nfield and proceed to St. Louis in\ntwo sections. No one had the\nheart to tell him. And the little\nwoman back in the train thought\nall was well.\nShortly after we left Springfield,\nMr. Benedict ambled back toward\nthe rear of the train in a leisurely\nmanner, but when he discovered\nthat the last half of the train was\nsome miles behind there was some\nthing doing. He was thoroughly\nangry and stormed around, doing\nall sorts of unnecessary talking.\nHe threatened to bring a damage\nsuit against the railroad company,\nor to beat the head off the conduc\ntor and all the road officials. No\none could pacify him.. When we\nstopped at the next station the con\nductor wired the bride on the fol\nlowing train that her hubby would\nwait for her at Alton.\n"How she stood the long ride\nwithout her man we never knew,\nbut it\'s altogether likely that she\nnearly cried her eyes out at the\nforced separation. As the first\nhalf of the train stopped at Alton,\nwe all bade goodbye to the unhap\npy groom and left him there await\ning the arrival of his bride."\nMilvaukee Sentinel.\nA Gentle Cinic.\nIt takes a lot of luck to push a\nman up hill.\nThe wages of sin often come\nwithout working.\nSome people seem tireless in\nmaking other people tired.\nWhen some people tell the truth\nthey have to label it.\nWhen women grow jealous the\ndevil proceeds to get busy.\nThe pessimist never hopes for\nthe best, yet growls if he doesn\'t\nget it. \' "\nThere is no hope for the fellow\nwho is too weak to turn over a\nhew leaf. "\nDon\'t cross your bridge till you\ncome to it and maybe it wont be\nthere.\nContentment flies out of the\nwindow wnen ambition stalks in\nat the door.\nWe would never suspect how\nnice some people are if they did\nnot tell us.\nThere is always a soft berth for\nthe fellow who can rout somebody\notcA rmf nf ?t-\nDeliver us from our friend,\ncan generally manage to take carelDOtil ar.t an(i nature must combine\not our enemies.\nBadger Found Gold Mine.\nN- H. George, Santa Fe yard\nmaster, has taken a layoff of three\nweeks and gone to Nevada to de\nvelop a gold mining claim which\nhe has there. There is quite a story\nback of his going.\nMr. George grubstaked an old\nminer who had struck a streak of\nbad luck. This miner finally found\nsome excellent surface indications\nin the Nevada Mountains and stak\ned his claim. The prospects were\nso good that Mr. George, his broth\ner and his brother-in-law took three\nadjoining claims. The old grizzled\nminer worked away all winter on\nthe funds supplied him by Mr.\nGeorge. His developments were\nencouraging, but did not pan out\nlarge quantities of the yellow metal.\nA short time since another old\nminer, in hard luck, came past this\nfirst miner\'s claim, carrying his\nkit of tools with him. Mr. George\'s\nfriend was naturally lonesome and\ninvited the stranger to take a claim,\nand after looking over the situation\nthis stranger decided to do so. An\nevening or two later the two min\ners sat on a ledge of rock talking\nwhen a badger ran into a hole on\nthe stranger\'s claim.\nThey went to work with they:\npicks and soon dug the badger out,\nand in doing so they made a re\nmarkable discovery. His bed, in\nthe bottom of the hole, was made\non a big chunk of the very richest\ngold ore. The gold in the stone on\nwhich he lay was worth $10,000.\nIn this way they discovered a rich\nvein of gold-bearing quartz which\nruns \'through both their mines as\nwell as those belonging to Mr.\nGeorge, his brother and his brother-in-law.\nMr- George\'s trip to\nNevada is for the purpose of fully\ninvestigating his new gold mine.\nGalveston News.\nPointed Paragraphs.\nSix feet of earth or a bathtub\nmakes all men equal.\nFear of being reformed keeps\nmany a man in the bachelor class.\nOnly the man who is blindly in\nlove fails to see, through a coat of\ncomplexion paint.\nShoplifters should go into a drug\nstore and take something for what\'s\nthe matter with thf.ni.\nSome men are kept so busy\ncriticising others that they have no\ntime to accomplish anything them\nselves.

Ann\nstrong, the naturalist, a visit was\nmade to see his collection of snakes\nand, other wild animals near the\ncemetery. The snake pens were\nfirst inspected, and a never to be\nforgotten sight was the rattlesnake\npen, where over a hundred of these\nvenomous serpents wriggled and\nwrithed about, or lay in sluggish\ncontent digesting their evening\nmeal. Many of them are of im\nmense size, and, in fact, nearly all\nwere quite large. There were also\nquite a number of black snakes in\nadjacent pens. The collection of\nbirds includes some very handsome\nowls, herons, pelicans, flamingoes,\netc., which were well worth seeing.\nA most interesting feature of the\ncollection is the wiid cats, of which\nMr. Armstrong has several beauti\nful specimeus. A fox, a coyote, an\narmadillo and a beaver also consti\ntute members of this strange col\nony. All are securely guarded jn\ncages of wire netting. Mr. Arm\nstrong is constantly shipping these\nwild animals to various museums\nor zoological gardens throughout\nthe country, and he keeps a num\nber of men occupied, hunting and\ntrapping for him. He has had many\nyears experience in this line, be\nsides being an expert taxidermist,\nand finds this unusual occupation\nboth remunerative and interesting.\nAmong the incoming passengers\nyesterday afternoon were Mr. and\nMrs. Dan Alexander, of Victoria,\nwho will spend several weeks with\nrelatives and are the gutsts of their\ncousin, Ben. Kowalski and family.\nA part of their visit will be spent\nat Point Isabel. Mr. Alexander\nwas at one time a business man of\nMatamoros, .being engaged in\nwholesale merchandise. He left\nhere in 1866 but has been back sev\neral times\'since on visits to rel\natives and friends. It is safe to\nsay he finds many changes in both\nBrownsville and Matamoros- r.\nAlexander reports the cotton pros\npect good in the Victoria section,\nbut says corn was cut a little short\nby dry weather. Railroad build\nding is under way from Victoria to\nO\'Connorport, and Mr. Alexander\nthinks the extensions proposed\nwill be of great aid to Victoria.\nThe old Lott grade is to be used,\nand is said to be in good condition.\nThe contemplated construction in\ncludes a line from Yoakum to New\nBraunfels and thence to San An\ntonio. The Herald learns from Judge\nHood, late of Weatherford, that he\nhas purchased several tracts of\nland up the river twelve miles,\naggregating about 1700 acres. He\nwill leave soon for Weatherford to\nclose up his affairs there, and tells\nuj he will then return, build a\nresidence on his new purchase and\nmake his home on the Rio Grande.\nJudge Hood will engage in general\nfarming but will not dip very deep\ninto truck growing at present. He\nwill give special attention to corn\nand cotton. The Herald wel\ncomes Judge and Mrs. Hood to\nthis section and feels \'sure they\nhave made no mistake in the selec\ntion of a location. The land pur\nhere, left this morning for Tucson,\nArizona, where their mother is\nsojourning for the benefit of her\nhealth. The young ladies were ac- j\ncompanied to San Antonio by their j\nbrother, L. H. Bates, while another\nbrother, W. B.
