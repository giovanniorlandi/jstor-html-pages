According to L. W. Wins, Jr.,\nof the Missouri College of Agriculture,\nthe most accurate methods of deter\nmining these are :\n(1) Milk production by means of\nthe milk scales and the Babcock test;\n(2) Reproduction by breeding records.\nThere is only a small proportion of\nthe cows used for dairy purposes on\nwhich such records are kept. This ne-\n. Mill\n1 .\n, 4 i-\nilli\npi ar\nChampion Dairy Cow.\ncessitates the employment of some\nother method of selection. In the\nbreeding of high producing animals\nthrough several generations it has\nbeen observed that there are certain\ncharacteristics of the conformation\nwhich are correlated with large pro\nduction. These characteristics are\nnamely: (1) Extreme angular form,\ncarrying no surplus flesh, but in good\nphysical --rendition. (2) Prominent de\nvs\'opmeuc of the udder and veins. (3)\nTlu symmetrical --development\'-, of the;\nbarrel with large capacity. -After one\nbecomes t araillar with \' these external\ncharacteristics it is possible to select\ncows producing 300 pounds of fat per\nyear from those producing 150 pounds.\nThe difficulty comes in picking the ani\nmal that will produce 500 pounds of\nfat per year compared to the one pro\nducing 400 pounds.\nThe selection of animals by this\nmethod is rather uncertain. Until rec\nords are kept of more animals or some\nother means devised for selection, the\nselection by type should be used and\nit is up to everyone interested in\ndairy cattle to become familiar with it.\nLEGUME HAYS ARE VALUABLE\nUtilization of Alfalfa or Clover Partly\nSolves Dairyman\'s Prob\nlem of Feed.\n(By G. E. WEAVER, University Farm,\nSt. Paul, Minn.)\nOne hundred and seventy-five pounds\nof good alfalfa or clover hay is worth\nas much as 100 pounds of the ordinary\nera in feeds. With the present prices\nfor feeds ranging from ,$25 a ton for\nbran to $85 per ton for corn, the aver\nage cost for, 100 pounds of grain is\nabout .$2.75. The cost of its food\nequivalent in the form of 175 pounds\nof legume hay is $2.15. This much hay\nwill produce 200 pounds of milk and\neffect a saving In feed cost of GO cents,\nwhich is at the rate of 30 cents for\neach hundred pounds.\nThe utilization of such hay partly\nsolves the dairyman\'s problem in these\ndays of high feed cost and milk investigations.\nHEIFERS OF GOOD BREEDING\nNo Stock More Profitable as They Con\nsume Less Compared With\nL --. Growth. They Make.\nNo stock pays better to grow at\nthis time than young heifers of good\nbreeding. They consume less feed com\npared with valuable growth than al\nmost any other animal and there sure\nwill be a good market "awaiting them\nwhen they begin to be cows. They\nShould be kept thrifty and doing their\nbest, though and a very little grain\nwill do this.\nTWO COMBINATIONS ARE POOR\nGood Cow in Hands of Unintelligent\nDalrymsn Is Most Undesirable\nDairy Proposition.\nA good cow in the hands of a poor\ndairyman is a poorer proposition than\na poor cow in the hands of a good\ndairvman. Both are very poor com\nbinations, however; a good dairyman\n.will not keep a poor cow more thaa\none season.\nSTRONG FENCING FOR STOCK\nWhere This Improvement Has Been\nOverlooked There Is Sure to Be\nTrouble in Herds.\nTtemeniber that it tak&g A good\nstrong fence to hold the jcowg and\ncalves apart during the long wintej\nmonths, and where this improvement\nis lacking there Is sure to be trouble\nur you.\nIMPROVING THE BAD SPOTS\nCertain Small Ruts That Are Usually\nWet and Soft Determine Load \'\nFarmer Can Carry.\nThe worst holes in the road always\ndetermine the load the farmer can\nmarket. No stretch of roadway is uni\nformly good, because every road has\ncertain small spots that are usually\nsoft and wet. These spots cause more\ntrouble than the rest of the road com\nbined. How these spots are to be im\nproved depends on the character of\nthe soil, and the nature of the coun\ntry. Many such spots owe their char\nacter to a soft subsoil, due to springs.\nBefore these roads can. be permanent\nly improved they must be under\ndrained. If a tile is laid in these\nplaces there will usually be no trouble\nIn the future. The surface of the road\nshould then be filled with dirt and\ncrowned, so any surface water may\nrun off. If this is done there will be\nno trouble from subsurface water.\nMany roadways that are closed in\nwith shade trees are bad. If a goodly\nportion of the scrub timber along these\nroads be removed, the ground will dry\nout and no trouble result. If the char\nacter of the soil is soft and pliable, so\nthat it will not pack and remain firm,\nnew material should be applied to the\nsurface. The best and cheapest mate\nrial for improving roads Is gravel.\nWhere gravel beds are accessible a\nday\'s work with a team and wagon\nwill improve any roadbed permanent\nly. If the soil is very sandy an 8-inch\napplication of clay to the surface will\neffect wonders. The road patrol should\nspend a considerable portion of its\ntime in remedying the bad spots in the\nroad. " \' -\nANSWEFLTO PRISON, PROBLEM\nNew York and Other States Have\n.Tried Experiment of Using Con\nvicts to Improve Roads.\nNew York and many of the Southern\nand Western states have tried the ex-\nperiment of using convicts to improve\nhighways and it has worked to per\nfection. The official organ of the New\nYork" state prisoners says that "no\nman of all the inmates who went out\nBide last year had a word of fault to\nfind with his treatment. All are anx\nious to join these camps again. The\nfreedom of movement and the exer-\nConvict Gang at Work.\nelse shortens the time yet to do in a\nwonderful manner. Many states have\nfound road work to be the answer to\nthe prison problem. Colorado and Cali\nfornia have rebuilt the better portion\nof their roads with prison labor, and\nbesides feeding the inmates with an\nextra supply of food, it has also led to\na lessening of time through provisions\n.made by the farslghted legislators.\nWIDE TIRES IMPROVE ROADS\nThey Have Same Effect on Country\nHighway as Roller on Field\nAlso Pull Easier.\nWide tires build up roads and save\nhorse labor. They have the eame e?\nfeet upon a country road as a roller on\na plowed field. On the other hand, the\nnarrow tire cuts up a road like a disk,\nIt has been found by actual test In this\nmatter that the wide-tired wagon\npulls easier in nearly all cases than\nthe narrow-tired wagon. In \'deep mud\non a country road the wide-tired wag\non pulls 6.2 per cent easier. On the\ncountry road with a thin surface of\nmud or deep dust, however, the nar\nrow tires pull 4.9 per cent easier. In\na cornfield the wide tires pull 30.5 per\ncent easier, in a dry alfalfa field 17.7\nper cent easier, and on a dry country\nroad lUus per cent easier.\nOntario Makes Good Roads.\nThe Province of Ontario has ap\nproximately 55,000 miles of roads..\nMore than 43,000 miles have been\ntreated and are in fairly good condi\ntion. About 20,000 miles are well\ngraded earth roads ; about 3,000 miles\n.are surfaced with broken stone, and\nabout 19,000 are surfaced with graveL\nAll Roads Lead Home.\nAil roads lead to home. You are not\nAt fault if th.oy are not all good roads,\n,but you are to blane if it\'s not u good\nborne.\nPROTECT YOUNG FRUIT TREES\nSnow Should Be Firmly Packed to\nPrevent Girdling by Rabbits\nand Field Mice.\nThe one and two-year old fruit trees,\nshould have the snow firmly packed\naround each tree, grapevine, currant\nand gooseberry bush. Unless this is\ndone, the trees may be girdled by rab\nbits above the snow line and the field\nmice under the snow.\nMuch the better method is to have\neach tree and bush wrapped with a\nstrip of tarred paper from six inches\nbelow the surface of the ground to 20\ninches above the ground.. Common\nbrown paper may be used if the bet\nter quality cannot be had. It takes\nbut a few minutes to wrap each tree.\nWhere the winters are severe and\nthe snows deep, the tender bark of\nthe large fruiting trees is often\ngnawed. The trunk of the tree and\noften the branches have the greater\npart of the bark completely destroyed.\nField mice are more destructive than\nthe rabbits, as they work under the\nsnow and are much more numerous.\nr\nMORE CHICKENS ARE VANTED\nTIME TO PRUNE RASPBERRIES\nWork Must Be Done at Two Seasons\nof Year in Order to Accomplish\nthe Best Results.\nBecause of its manner of fruit bear\ning, the black raspberry requires care\nIn its annual pruning; in fact, pruning\nmust be done at two seasons of the\nyear in order to accomplish the best\nresults. The young shoots as they ap\npear from the roots in the spring\nshould be tipped or disbudded when\nthey reach the height of IS Inches. It\nIs better to go over the plantations fre\nquently, making three or four trips in\nall, in order to tip the canes when they\nare about the height mentioned, rather\nthan to delay the operation until some\nof them have reached a height ! 2 to\n22 feet.

It is evi\ndent, therefore, that summer pruning\npredetermines the crop for the succeed\ning year more than does any other sin\ngle cultural factor.\nThe second pruning, which is also\nimportant, consists in removing the\ncanes which bore the last crop of fruit.\nThis work can be done at any time af\nter the crop has been harvested, but\npreferably during the spring following\nthe crop.\nDISEASES OF PEACH TREES\nBrown Rot and Scab Held Fairly Weil\nin Check by Use of Lime-Sui-\'\nphur Spray.\nBrown rot and scab in peaches have\nbeen fairly wefl held in check in New\nJersey by the use pf the self-boiled\nlime-sulphur spray, but the best possi\nble results have not always been ob\ntained because the spray injured the\ntrees in summer, so that growers put\noff the summer application. Now they\nhave worked out a new preparation\nwhich has given satisfaction as a sum\nmer fungicide without injuring the\ntrees. It is made by mixing eight\npounds of fine dry sulphur with four\npounds hydrated lime, dissolving one !\nand one-half ounces of ground glue in\nthree gallons of water, then- thorough\nly Incorporating the two mixtures and\ndiluting the whole with water to make\n50 gallons.\nAffliction Caused by P$rr.aine Poison\ning From Eating Decaying Flesh\nTry to Prevent.\nU\nLimber neck in chiclns is caused by\nptomaine poisoning fifom eating de\ncaying flesh.

The atten\ntion and labor they require can be giv\nen largely even by children, and should\nnot require the employment of addi\ntional hired workers. On some farms\nthe chickens practically pay for them\nselves by their destnjetion of orchard\nand vegetable insects. On others they\nhelp to pay for themselves by their\nproduction of manure, which when\nproperly used largely increases thf\nvalue of the land. Fifty fowls will an\nnually produce at least a tea of roa-:\nnurethat can be made as valuable as\nconur.srcial fertilizer,\nWHY HATCH EARLY. j\nRABBIT DAMAGE N ORCHARD\nGiven Credit for Mope Harm Than\nThey Are Guilty of as Rule\nMice Do Most Injury.\nRabbits-usually do less damage In\norchards than they are credited wllh.\nIn very young orchards or in nurseries\nthey sometimes cut off the young\nbranches and may occasionally gnaw\nthe bark, but as a rule they do iess\ndamage than mice.\n(Prepared by the United States De-\npartment of Agriculture.\nChickens hatched early in the\nspring are large in the su iyier,\n5 mature early in the fa.!l. and lay\neggs in the winter.

This is the great national necessity at the\npresent time. Jt is needed for the immense armies we are sending abroad at\nthe present time. It is needed for the Allied armies who are so gloriously hold\ning the llattle Line in Western France until the Americans can get "on the\njob" and drive the German Hordes back across the Rhine.\nIt is wheat flour that is so badly needed for bread stuffs over there. It is\nwheat flour that the American Government must have and our American Pa\ntriots at home must provide it by savings in the homes. There is no other\nsource of supply until the next harvest. Thus duty calls us to our part in the\nwar.\nKnowing that all loyal citizens are glad and willing to conform their house\nholds to the six pound ration until the new havest, but knowing also that we\nhave some among us who are disloyal and pro-German and perhaps not averse\nto seeing sacrificed the splendid brave youth of the nation who are going from\nour homos to fight for our freedom, the Government is protecting our loyal\ncitizens against those disloyal in meeting this call for the saving of wheat\nHour. There is on the Statute Books a law against Hoarding under which\nthose who hold an unreasonable amount of flour are being prosecuted by the\nDepartment of Justice in the Federal Courts. The penalty for convicted hoard\ners is a fine not to exceed $5,000, and imprisonment not to exceed two years,\nor both.\nThe Fooii Administration has determined the amount of wheat that is\navailable from now until harvest for the American people. It has determined\nthat a reasonable use must not exceed six pounds per month per person and\nhas stated that it is unreasonable in this emergency to have on hand more\nthan a thirty days\' supply on this ration for our householders.\nAny person who has on hand more than this amount is liable to prosecu\ntion as a hoarder of flour under the law on orders from the Food Administra\ntion. The procedure is by indictment in the Federal Court.\nRecognizing, however, that many patriotic persons, following practices\nformerly considered legitimate and usual, have laid in larger quantities of flour\nthan in this time of National Emergency is considered seasonable and right,\nv.\' M , nviiv .f these persons acted in so doing from proper motives, the\n1 \'. ;t.u Ada 1 \'istration in the interest of fairness and justice, now offers to those\n\'izt-ns v. fD hav-3 thus acted in good faith, the opportunity of showing their\npatriotism and insuring themselves against the notoriety and penalties thai,\nv. o.u.1 rt-av.." !"ron. prosecution.\nXo person in Kentucky, therefore, who makes and liles with their "County\nFood Administrator the statement disclosed in the Pledge at the head of this\narticle and holds his surplus flour for the Government, agreeing to turn it over\nif it is needed, will be prosecuted by the Government for hoarding flour.\nThe Food Administration will not call for your surplus unless\' it is neces\nsary, aid w hen it does call, will leave you your thirty days\' supply, but it must\nknow where the flour is and it must have your promise to turn it over as a\nmeasure of National Safety.\nIn some Kentucky counties, owing to shortage of supply, it has already\nbeen found necessary to direct that excess holdings be marketed, but it is only\nin cases of emergency that such action is contemplated.\nWhen this call comes to you think of the needs of our soldiers, the brave\nboys who light our battle for freedom, for the safety of our homes from the\nmenace of the Huns. Don\'t let anyone say you are a slacker because you have\nnot offered your surplus to the Government in time of need. Every pound of\nflour now counts in this time of trouble. Remember also that the influence of\nyour offer on other citizens not so patriotically inclined, may save the lives of\nmany brave boys from your own home town.
