Hall, in Portland Oregonian x\nA jocund miller once lived by a stream and faithfully ran his mill.\nIn the early dawn you could see the gleam of his windows below the hill;\nEach man who came with a grist to grind went out with his own full \'share,\nAnd the miller sung while his great wheel flung its tune to the morning air.\nThe miller was free in a heedless way, so the folks of the mountain said,\nDeclaring that naught did he save each day the shingles to mend o\'er head ; !\nBut his cheer was elixir that thrilled the veins, his mill was beloved for miles,\nWhile the rich and poor who came, to the door were blessed with his wealth of\nsmiles. v .\nA rich man dwelt by the selfsame brook in a mansion a-top the hill,\nThere was velvet lawn where.no man took his rest in the evening still;\nFor an iron fence stood hard and grim to guard every stick and stone, I\nAnd no song came down to the drowsy town from the mansion tall and lone. \'\nThe rich man passed by the mill each day and the miller would smile and wave,\nEut the brief response from the near highway was chillingly cool and grave;\nThe miller but twirked a pudgy thumb and winked with a roguish eye,\nNor gave more thought to the snub he got from the miser riding by.\nYears hence and the Reaper came for toll and two men answered "Here !"\nNow silent the wheel the waters roll the mansion is dark and drear :\nThey made two graves on the hillside green neath skies that were limpid blue,\nThe miller\'s hands \'were empty, clean; the rich man\'s empty, too!\nThere\'s an iron fence \'round the rich man\'s tomb where he slumbers in lone state,\nBut no one comes in the twilight gloom to weep by the iron gate;\nHe wove him a shroud out of cold disdain that enfolds him within his grave,\nNo rose is found on his lowly mound for thistles were all he gave.\nEut the old red mill brings many a tear from friends who must pass that way,\nThey gently speak of the love and cheer that the miller had spread each day;\nThey talk of the leak in the old mill roof as they paused by his lowly grave,\nAnd roses grew from the tears that flow for roses were what he gave.\nPREDICTION COMING TRUE\n(From Philadelphia" Public Ledger, Rep.\nThe inevitable clash between President Harding and the group\nof "irreconcilablps" in the senate is coming faster than the country\nhad expected. The fighting is being forced by the president and not\nby the senate.\nThe "tltter-enders" were caught off balance and with guards\ndown by the suddenly announced decision of the White House placing\nAmerican representatives on the council of ambassadors, the repara\ntions commission and the supreme council. The senate had not re\ncovered from this surprise when the orders went forth from the presi\ndent to party leaders in the lower house that the Knox resolution must\nbe held up for an indefinite time.\nA resentful senate finds itself in a helpless position for the imme\ndiate present. The play has passed out of its hands; the ball is out of\nsenate territory. All the irate senators can do just now is gnash their\nteeth and compare, while biding their time, the position President\nHarding now occupies with that held by Woodrow Wilson a few short\nmonths ago.\nThe last two moves by the administration mean war or weaken\ning. There is not much evidence that the administration will weaken\nfco long as Hughes and Hoover are in the cabinet. The classification\nof the "bitter-enders" tells the tale of their fighting and staying\nqualities. But the presidential policy reaches beyond the Borah\nJohnson, McCormick and Knox group and touches many another sen\nator who is jealous of senate powers and privileges.\nThe whole question of whether we shall participate in European\naffairs or isolate ourselves is so big and so vital that it must be fought\nout. The administration has swung around to the view that for our\nown sake we must help in straightening out the European tangle.\n"When the decision was reached it was found that the only way to go\nwas to go backward. Republican leaders are admitting that the pol\nicies initiated will carry America straight back toward the position\nwe quitted during the treaty fight in the senate. \'\nIn these policies the president has broken with his old alignments\nand receded from positions that he maintained as Senator Ilarding.\nHe knows bis antagonists and has chosen his battlefield. Party disci\npline will help him, and unquestionably he will need that help. There\nis a certain irony in the situation that doubtless will come with full\nfiavor to the immediate predecessor of President Harding. f\nDEATH OF FRANKLIN KNIGHT LANE\nk ...! .V\' f f\nWANTED\n1\nA seamstress to do lneral . sewing\nand learn to run the hemstitching ma\nchine.

The\nrepeated defeats of personal hopes in his home state did not dampen\nhis ardor, in fact, strengthened it, as he was always relied upon to\ncome back, which he did.\nHis retirement to private life, owing t( ill 4tealth, was a regret-to\nall who knew him. The west learned to lean toward him in any pinch\nand he was.consistent in support of interests that were slighted by big\nbusiness of the east.\nWhile his loss is national, the people of the west will naturally\nfeel that they have the heaviest grief to bear. He was among the\nbig men moulded west of the Rockies and his fidelity to his constitu\nents and the people as a whole endeared him to many. His name be\ncame a familiar synonym for the land that sloped to the Pacific.

The section occupied and being fought over\nhas in no sense any bearing ou America, and to take a hand in the\nmix-up would simply lend aid to one side or the other to the disadvan\ntage of America. \'\nMany have disagreed with Mr. Hughes on some of his foreign pol\nicies, but in this instance he will have the backing of the people.\n00\nENFORCE THE CURFEW\nSeveral times the Appeal has touched on the hoodlum, annoyances\nwhich have been manifest in this city for a considerable space of time.\nOne city peace officer cannot handle the situation, nor can the small\nforce at the sheriff\'s office cover the entire town, therefore the an\nnoyances have continued. \'\nCarson has a curfew ordinance; what\'s the matter with enforc\ning it? The act of the transgressors unfortunately falls on the just\nand unjust, but enforcement of the curfew would relieve suspicion\nfor a time and have a very beneficial effect.\nLet youth understand that age still has a right and that women\nwho are trying to beautify their grounds are entitled to the protec\ntion that the charter warrants.\nPatience has ceased to be a virtue and with a few of the hoodlums\nrounded up who disobey the curfew a respect for law and order would\nfollow.\n\'\'Big Bill" Haywood prefers Russia to the penitentiary at Leav\nenworth. There is no accounting for tastes. Boston Transcript.\nSecretary Hughes says Kussia is an "economic vacuum." "Why\nnot permit a shipment of vacuum cleaners?

General Gaucher, who commands\nthe French and British forces of occu\npation in Dusseldorf, has a warm spot\nin his heart for the American army. By\nthe medium of this dispatch he wants\nto be cordially remembered to General\nCameron, to General Menoher, to Gen\neral Johnson and to General MacArthur.\nIt was under Gaucher that the famous\nAmerican 42d, or Rainbow, division re\nceived its baptism of fire. Gaucher\'s\neyes light up when he speaks of the\nRainbow lads, and particularly when he\nmentions that fine young soldier, "the\nMacArthur," a general who was often\ntimes ahead of his own first line infant\nry in an advance.\nThen he was in command over Cam\neron of the 4th division in the famous\ncounter-attack of July 18, 1918. He tells\nwith relish of how he and Cameron\nshared the same "P. C." during that\noperation and controlled the develop\nment of their share of it.
