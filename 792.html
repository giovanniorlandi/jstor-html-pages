        <pre>['ESTABLISHED IS IC.\nFIRST SETTLERS\nOF POCAHONTAS\nCel. .William Lamb, of Norfolk\nGave Town Us Name?Dr. Jas.\nO\'Kcelfe Started Develop?\nment of Great Coal Field.\nAccording to Col. Jumoa Drowning\nthe town of Pocnhontas was given\nits name by Col. William Lamb, of\nNorfolk, commander at Fort Fisher,\nnear Wilmington, N, C... during thi\ncivil war (during my boyhood days\nI would hear my brother in law\nspeak of Col. Lamb, his old com?\nmander at Fort Fisher.) Others\nclaim that it was the first intention\nto name the town Mary Moore, hi\nhonor of the youngest daughter of\nSquire W. T. Moore, who lived in\nAbb\'s Valley at the time, and hn?\nbeen fererred to in a previous art?\nicle, lie was a descendent of the cap?\ntives or Abb\'s Valley. It was decid?\ned that the name was too long. A\nwriter in the year 1012 states that\nit was named by a gentleman in\nPhiladelphia (possibly referring to\nF. J. Kimball) who gave it the name\nof Pocnhontas, in honor of John\nSmith\'s rescuer. Others have stated\nthat the town was named after Min?\nnie Pocnhontas Butt, the "first child\nborn in Pocnhontas, taking her middle\nname. The chances are that Colonel\nBrowning is right, and that the town\nwas given its name by Col. Lamb,1\nwho (1 believe) was a director of the\nN. &. W. R. R., and came to this\nsection occasionally. J\nPrevious articles failed to mention\nthe nnme of Col. Thomas Graham,]\nof Philadelphia, who is given credit\nfor being the leader in discovering\nthe possibilities of this section and\ndirecting the attention of capitalists\nto the wealth stored away in these\nmountains. He was said to be the\npromoter of the Southwest Virginia\nImprovement Company. Whether this\nis correct or not he was a man of\nenthusiasm and energy, and helped\nto put this section on the map, as\nwell as the town of Graham, which I\nbelieve is named after him. His son,\nJohn Graham, Jr., was engineer for\nthe new railroad work.\nThe late Dr. James O\'KeefTe, of\nTazewell, who was then living at\nPearisburg, was selected by the cap?\nitalists as advance agent to purchase\nall coal lands available, and came to\nthis section in March, 1881, to lake\noptions on coal land, traveling1 on\nhorseback, this being the only means\nof travel, not even a wagon road op?\nened in portions of the territory cov?\nered by him. He spent bis first night\nhero in Jordan Nelson\'s cabin, sit?\nuated in the "Horseshoe," opposite\nand across Laurel Creek from the\npresent cemetetry belonging to the\ntown. After Dr. D\'Keeffe had se?\ncured the options, Wm. M\'cGeorge,\nJr., an attorney and conveyancer of\nPhiladelphia, came with a force of\nclerks to examine and pass upon the\ntitles to flie lands purchased by con?\ntract.\nMr. Wm. A. Lathrop. the first\nsuperintendent, previously referred\nto, accompanied by his estimable\nwife, reached Pocnhontas in October,\n1881, and finding no room here he\nand Mrs. Lathrop boarded with\n"Uncle Billy" Moore, in Abb\'s Valley,\nsix miles from here. At the time of\nhis arrival the present site contained\none log house about where The\nBloch Company\'s store is now locat?\ned, occupied by Wm. E. Butt and\nfamily, and one tobacco barn which\nstood in the rear of the colored Met?\nhodist church. One- of Lathrop\'s first\nacts was to provide shelter for the\nengineering corps, under J. W. Bak?\ner, chief engineer. J. W. Minor and\nBro., of Connellsvillee, Pa., were tin;\ncontractors to build the first coke\novens, 100 bank and 100 block ovens.\nSpeaking of Blakcy\'s corps there are\nseveral names mentioned, (among\nwhom were Cus Spotts, Henley G.\nHenderson, Ancil D. Witten nnd Dick\nWitten, Tom T. Taylor John 1).\nBarns, Charl>s Black, John and Will\nGrnham, Charlie Witten, John Wil?\nson and others, some of whom have\ngone to their reward, where man\'s\nvirtues "are not measured with the\ntnpe line." These men remember and\ncan talk interestingly of the "Cin?\ncinnati chicken," "Black Jack" mo?\nlasses, potaties boiled with their\ncoats, vests and pants on at the Lilly\nboarding house. It is no wonder that\nthey needed at times a little stimu?\nlant, nnd no one would be disposed\nto criticise them now if they some?\ntimes partook to excess of these\nliquid refreshments. If some of the\nparty did not so indulge they will\nunderstand, of course, that there art\nexceptions to nearly all rules.\n"Old Slabtown" was the name oi\nthe portion of town where Samuel\nT. Litz opened up the first meal\nmarket and snack house on a capital\nof $12.50, and it is said that he slept\nnt night on the soft side of a boart\nin his place of business, which was\nthe only "hangout" in the place. His\ncounter consisted of the bottom oi\nu goods box, and he had scarcelj\nroom enough to turn himself aboui\non the inside. He made a squari\nopening similar to a ticket agent\':\ndelivery window, and through tin:\naperture passed the snacks to tin\nwaiting customers outside, rcccivini\ntherefor the sum of one dime. Thi\nwas the beginning of his oventfu\ncareer.\nJ. M. NEWTON.\n.SPEED COPS GETTING BUSY.\nThe speed cops in the county, espc\nially in the section between Tuzt\nwell and Graham, on the recent!\ncompleted road, have been umisuall\nactive the past few weeks, and\nnumber of speed maniacs have bee\ncaught.\nSEED WHEAT SHORTAGE.\nFrom reports not only in Tazewol\nbut from all over Virginia, it is ev\nidont that the farmers face seriou.\nI trouble in getting satisfactory see<\n.wheat for this fall. In most cases tin\nnetw crop is unlit for seed becaust\nof poor development. The State au?\nthorities have requested us to loeaU\nand test germination of nil what ol\ngocd quality available for seed. This\napplies to the old crop as well as th?i\nnow crop. Farmers having wheat ol\ngood quality for sale, are requested\nto send us samples, state whethei\nbearded or smooth, and amount for\nsale. If it tests out all right we can\nlikely sell considerable of it for you\n? Ii other parts of the State, at seed\nprices and also advise you as to your\nown seed wheat. The Tazewell Farm\nBureau. will list wheat for sale, offer\nit for sale to the State Authorities\nund advise farmers when to bring\nit in. It will likely have to be re\ncleaned before shipping. It is im?\nportant that you act at once in this\nmatter. Watch your seed wheat.?R.\nM. Wall, Couny Agt., C. K. Fisher,\nAsst.

At. Davis, of\nthe State Home Department. The ob?\nject of the exhibition was to demon\nsrnto the steam pressure method of\ncooking, an entirely new method here,\nbut one which seems to have been\npretty widely adopted in other sec-\'\ntions of the county.\nA number of vegetables, chickens,!\netc., were cooked by this method,\nwhich is specially recommended when 1\ncanning is to be done. It was show.i\n\'.hat canning of vegetables and of.\nme:.Is, etc., call be done more e.\\-l\npeditiously by the new method.\nWhether or not any of the ladies!\nadopt the new method was not stat?\ned. Anyway, the occasion furnished\na lot of free advertising for the\nmanufacturers of the outfits and oil\nstoves.\nThe house Weepers of the communi?\nty need soate practical instruction,\nthey - sny, as how best to use the\npresent methods to the best advant?\nage, rather than the introduction of\nnew and costly methods. ? I\nWhile not opposed to the adoption\nof new methods which in most homes\nis impracticable if not impossible,\ntin re ;s need of some up-to-date in?\nstruction how to employ to best- ad?\nvantage, the means and methods in\nhand.\nNURSING THE SICK AT PEARIS\nBURG.\nMrs. .1. It. Neal, Bristol, Will Pain?\nter\'s sister, was stricken with typhoid\nfever and had to go to the suni-1\ntarium. She sent her children to her\nsister, Mrs. T. F. Witten at Pearis\nburg. Her baby, about 4 years old,\nwas taken with fever and pneumonia,\nand Mrs. Painter left Tazewell Wed?\nnesday to the bedside of the little\nfellow, and will help to nurse it back\nto health.\nI.O.ST KEYS.\nTwo keys on a string lost be\ntweon Episcopal church and front\ngate of Rev.

AND ONE MAN\n?Wfliccrs Tour Out 500 Gallons\n? j of Beer, Capture Moonshiner,\n?I and Make Another Bun For\nHis Life.\nSergeants Boothe, of North Tuzc\nwell and Thompson, of Tazewell, as?\nsisted by several deputy sergeants,\ncaptured a moonshine still in the\nPaint Lick neighborhood Tuesday\n1 night, and also a young man by\nj name of Arch Lowe, and seared two\nI other men and a woman so badly\n: that they literally picked up their\n\' feet, and" the only reason they ran so\nfast was because they couldn\'t fly,\nI With the still was found also some\n.100 gallons of mash, some singlings,\nI and a still full of stuff ready to run.\n] Bacon, sugar, coffee nnd other things\nI to eat were cached near the still. The\nj officers had a straight tip as to the\nlocation of the still, and sometime\nlate Monday night congregated around\n? the spot, and waited for day light.\n, "About gray day," said Sergeant\n? Thompson, "two men and a hoy were\nseeti coming to the still, prepared to\nbuild a lire and start the run. After\nthey had gotten within thirty or for?\nty feet of us. Wo rushed them, and\nBoothe grabbed the hoy Lowe, and\nI made an effort to capture one of\nI the other men, but my lame ankle\n, kept me from running, and my man\nI got away, not, however, before I\n1 sprinkled bird shot all around him.\nI \'"alk about running., why that fel\n| low simply flew away from that\nplace. We turned the slop and sing\n| lings down the hill, burned up the\nsugar, meat and other things, and\nbrought the still and worm to town.\nThe moonshiners bad evidently been\nrunning this still for sometime, as\nthe two coliner kettles riveted to?\ngether showed long usage, and a\ncomplete running water system had\nli !eil installed by the use of pipes,\netc."\nAfter the officers bad departed\nwith the prisoner, they came on\'\ndown the mountain side, and one of\nthe men saw a woman slipping,\nthrough the brush like a grey hound,\nand they suppscd she had started\nfor the still to cook the mens break?\nfast, and the firing of the gun had\nscared her awav.

Is it possible that in these\nto blooded horses than to properly\ndays we are paying more attention\nrearing our boys and girls?\nThere are thousands of children In\nthis country who have no real homes.\nThey have" a place in which to eat\nand sleep, and like little animals, they\ncome in .only at eating and sleeping\ntime. These so called homes ale a\nmisnomer. They are not homes. And\nthis condition is not confuted to the\npoor. Fine houses and cosily sur?\nroundings do not make "a bom.\' "\nThere are real homes among the\nhumble, there lire travesties upon the\nname among the rich as well. Four\nwalls do not uonstitutc a home. The\nforty thousand ([iris and 15,000 boys\nwho "disappeared" last year could\nnot have had the proper kind of\nhome. Now and then but not /often,\ndoes a lamb stray from the fold\nwhen well kepted and carefully\nguarded. A careless, slothful and in\ndiffcrcnt shepherd jnvites prowling\nwolves, and encourages results he is\nsupposed to prevent.\nIs the American home only an\nempty name?a mockery.\nThe home, the church and the Sun?\nday School?these three great agen?\ncies are set "watchmen upon the\nwalls." Are they functioning? Are\nthey coping with the forces of evil\namongst us\'.\'\nThe courts are crowded with di?\nvorce cases. The picture shows n< ?\ncrowded daily by thousands of boys\nand girls, who feed upon lewd ex?\nhibitions by lewd women ami by\ndivorcees.\n?The Sunday Schools and churches\nare opened an hour or so once a\nweek, and sparsely attended. Im?\nmodesty encourages immorality on\nthe public streets every day.\nNo wonder, then, under present\nconditions?"crime waves",?after?\nmaths, we are told, of the great\nwar?little wonder is it, then, that\nboys and girls, and men and wom?\nen, too, "disappear" from homes and\nschools] and churches. Where are\nthese people- who have "disappear\ncd." Some of them driven to tlcspa\nration, have destroyed themselves.\nOthers, seized with the "wander?\nlust," are roaming aimlessly over lh>\nearth. Others still are rushing with\nflying feet the downward path to |\nruin and wreck. Rut why be pessimis?\ntic? Why write these things? Such\nconditions, they tell us, have always\nexisted?and always will exist. And\nthey will so long as laws are lax\nnnd the forces of righteousness sleep\non their arms. If the watchmen fads\nto watch nnd the sheep are destroy?\ned, the watchmen iv\'U he held re?\nsponsible, and called to account at\nthe Judgment bar of Almighty Clod.\nA HOY FARMER\'S RECORD.\nDon Milcy, a Florida farmer boy,\nwon the corn contest in that state\nin 1920. He succeeded in producing\n101.7 bushels of corn on one acre\nat a cost of 20 cents per bushel.\nSome of the old fellows, who com?\nplain that they have to sell farm\nproducts below the cost of produc?\ntion, would do well to go to see this\nFlorida boy and get his secret as\nto producing big yields as well as\nhow to keep expenses down.\nIf Don Miley\'s figures are correct,\nor even approximately so it would\nnppear that the cost of production\ndecreases us the yield per acre in?\ncreases.\nTHE WAR CRIMINALS.\nIt must be plain to everybody\nthat the German courts will not\nmow out adequate punishment to\nthose German army officers who\nwere accused of brutal and unwar?\nranted methods during the world\nwar. A score or more of officers have\nbeen tried, ranging in rank from\nmajor general down to Borgcant. |\nThoro havo been only two or three\nconvictions, and in these cases only\nnominal sentences hnve been impof\ned.\nComing at this time, when the\nworld has been wanting to believe\nthat Germany would act in good\nfaith in carrying out tho peace\nterms, that is more than ever un?\nfortunate. It will delay for a longei\nperiod of time the feeling of for?\ngiveness, or one of forgetfulnoss\nwhich is so badly needed.\nThe world will always believe that\nGerman officials caused the war, but\nthere has been a general hope that\nthe German people would show thut\nthey did not approve the acts of\ntheir leaders. If this is not done,\nGermany ami the German people\nwill suffer from it for generations to\ncome. It is a pity that this is true,\nhut true it is.\nA G It EAT .MAN GONE.\nDr. C. 1 Scolield is dead.\nThe announcement of his death\ncaused sorrow in many parts of this\ncountry, among church circles und\nHilde students. His reference Bible\nwill live us an imperishable monu?\nment to bis memory. He was active\nand successful as preacher, writer anil\nSunday School leader, lie amassed no\nfortune. He led no armies, he built\nno cathedrals or cities. The world\ntool; small notice of him, and meager\nmention was made in the papers of\nhis passing. Hut he was of that illus?\ntrious company of which the world\nwas not worthy but which has beeil\nimpoverished in his death.\nKTONK WALLS AND PICKET\nFENCES.\nSubmitted to liiucer & Vermilliou.\nIn the questions of which Hudson\nMaxim offered as a test of a person\':;\nmental equipment, following Edison\'s\nexample, there is nnu relating to\npicket fences and one to stone walls.\nI >oes it require \'more pickets to\nbuild a fence a mile and a quarter\nover a hill than in a tunnel through\nthe hill? The .answer is no. Does it\nrequire more stone to build a wall\nfour feet high over the hill than\nthrough the tunnel?\nMr. Maxim\'s answer to this is no\nalso. The theory of the pickets can\nhe tested by drawing a hill a straight\nline on paper. The .same number of\nilines representing pickets for thX:\nstraight line will be enough \' for\npickets for the hill. We suspect that\nif the hill were\' larger the theory\nwouldn\'t work.\nIt would require more rails to go\nover* the bill, as Mr. Maxim points\nout in another question. Then why\nwould it not require more stone in\nthe wall over the hill than in the\nwall through the tunnel. In the stone\nwall the stone serves as rail as well\nas picket. If more rail is required,\nwhy not more stones? Has tho mast?\ner mind II joker in his question? If\nso we bid for a supplemental answer.\nNOTICE.\nSALE OP VALUABLE ItEAL ES?\nTATE IN TAZEWELL.
