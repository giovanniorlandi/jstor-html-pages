        <pre>['THE ETTE.EE a s: WI N El ,\nESTABLISHED 1870. EUREKA, NEVADA, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1908. PUBLISHED MONDAYS.\nElinor Glyn After Senator Nixon\nA recent issue of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle contains the fol\nlowing account of an interview which Elinor Glyn, the notorious\nauthor of ‘’Three Weeks,” the tropical novel that gains in popular\nity as it is placed on the taliooed list, had with Senator Nixon of\nNevada:\nThe streets and hotels at\nWashington are swarming with\nmusical and literary talent. Art\nists are encountered on almost\nevery corner. Among the women\ncelebrities now there are Elinor\nGlyn, Amelia ltives and Laura\nJean Libbey.\nThe latter two are at the cap\nital to protest to Congress against\nthe present archaic copyright\nlaws, which permit the theft of\ntheir writings by playwrights\nwithout proper remuneration,\nMrs. Glyn is there pursuing her\nstud f American tyjH\'s for her\nfty .ning novel. Wednesday\n.e had luncheon with a party at\nthe capitol that included Senators\nFlint of California and Nixon of\nNevada.\nMrs. Glyn concluded that\nNixon was a good specimen of\nthe American! millionaire in poli\ntics and pounced upon him.\n“Are you a millionaire?” she\ndemanded.\nMJtS. FliTNOB OLYS.\n“I guess so.” confessed the guilty Nixou.\n“How many million have you?”\n“I don\'t know,” said Nixon, evidently embarrassed.\n“Dear me, the idea of a man having so much money he couldn\'t\ntell how wealthy he is. Does your wife know you are dining with me?"\n“The Lord forbid," ejaculated Nixou, who was getting visibly\nworried.\n“That\'s so strange,” was the reply of the writer. “Now your\nAmerican women are so different from our English women. We all\nencourage our husbands to accept dinner and luncheon invitations\nthat will enable them to meet charming women. I often have to in\nsist that my husband shall go out to dine with some other woman.”\nMrs. Glyn next wanted to know what Senator Nixon thought of\n“Three Weeks.”\nThe Senator replied that in all his wanderings as a miner, cow\nboy, hustler, banker, politician and Senator he had never met a man\nhe thought could come up to the standard of the hero of this much\ntalked about novel.\nOuida, the Novelist, Dies In Poverty\nFlorence, Italy, January 25.—From the clutches of the most\nabject poverty and destitution and from a lonely and friendless old\nage, made more bitter by almost complete blindness, death to-day\nreleased Ouida, one of the most brilliant novelists of her generation,\nthe writer whose stories delighted the late Queen Victoria and made\nfortunes for publishers.\nNo depths of pathos or tragedy that the fertile brain of Ouida\nherself ever sounded equals the pitiful story of her own end. Ten\nyears ago feted, honored and sought after, rich beyond her greatest\nneeds, Ouida lived regally like a princess. And to day she died\nfriendless, a beggar, weakened bv hunger and privation, without a\nroof of her own to shelter her and with only her dogs and one faith\nful old servant woman to bear her company at the end.\nOuida died in a squalid hut near Viareggio, a few miles from\nthe beautiful villa she lived in until poverty drove her forth practic\nally to beg her bread from the Italian fishermen and peasants.\nOuida, whose name was Louise de la Raroee, was born at Bury\nSt. Edmunds, in England, in 1840. While she was still almost a\ngirl she became famous as a writer of novels. Her first book, “Held\nin Bondage,” was published in 1863, when she was just 23 years\nold. After that novels poured in a steady stream from her pen.\nBetween 1863 and 1901 no less than 39 books which she had writ\nten were published. The name of Ouida, under which she wrote\nalmost from the beginning, became a household word wherever the\nEnglish language was spoken. The most famous of her novels\nwere: “Under Two Flags,” “Moths,” “Two Little Wooden Shoes,”\n“Tricotrin,” and “The Two Offenders.” Her last novel, “Street\nDust,” was published in 1901.\nGoldfield Wants Better Freight Rates\nGoldfield, Nevada, January 29.—A committee appointed by the\nGoldfield Chamber of Commerce is at work on a report to be filed\nwith the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington, showing\n*how the railroads operating in Nevada discriminate against the Ne\nvada merchants, and asking that the merchants of this State be\ngiven relief.\nIn the report the committee complains that if a farmer residing\nat Wabuska, Nevada, wishes to send a ton of potatoes from Wabus\nka to Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco or any other outside\npoint it will cost him just $10, but that if he wishes to send the\nsame potatoes from Wabuska to Goldfield, a distance of less than\n200 miles, and in the same State, he will have to pay $17.20 for\nfreight charges.\nThe Goldfield Chamber of Commerce declares that the railroads\nare doing more than anything else to hurt the prosperity of Nevada\nand that they should be forced to give the Nevada merchants a fair\ndeal.\nWestern Union Losing Money\nThe Western Union Telegraph Company has published an an\nnual statement to the effect that its receipts in Nevada during 1907\nwere $50,774.15, and ita expenses amounted to $240,367.51.\nRailways Plaining\nTo Cnt Expenses\nNew York, Jan. 27.— Figures\nprepared for one of the large\nrailroad companies, says the Tri\nbune, show that a week ago there\nwere 320,000 idle freight cars in\nthe United States and about 8000\nlocomotives which are laid up on\naccount of the falling off in traffic.\nAs there are 2,200.000 freight\ncars in the country, this would\nshow that 14 per cent of all the\ncars owned by the railroads are\nstored on railroad tracks waiting\nfor loads. Figuring the value of\ncars at 11000 each and the loco\nmotives at $15,000, the statement\nshows that the railroads have\n$440,000,000 tied up in rolling\nstock for which there is no present\nuse.\nIt it is estimated that more\nthan 30,000 men less are needed\nthan if all these cars were in ser\nvice. Fixed charges of a railroad\nmust be met in dull times as well\nas in active, and maintenance\nand other expenses must be pro\nvided for, and, in view of all the\nfacts, the management of many\nrailroads are understood to be\ndiscussing the question of reduc\ning wages, much disliked, but a\nnecessary measure.\nIt is said that within 90 days\nthe new smelter on Walker range,\nLyon County, within view of Yer\niugton, will be in operation.\nHungarian Count Secures Rick American\nIn the famous Vanderbilt mansion on Fifth avenue in New York\nCity at noon last Monday, Miss\nGladys, youngest daughter of Mrs.\nCornelius Vanderbilt, cousin of\nthe Duchess of Marlborough, and\none of the richest American heir\nesses, became the bride of Count\nLaszlo Jeno Maria Henrik Simon\nSzechenyi, a young Hungarian\nnoble of ancient lineage and com\nfortable fortune. Last Summer\nMiss Vanderbilt became of age\nand, under the provisions of her\nfather’s will, entered into posses\nsion of her share of his great\nfortune, estimated at from $12,\n000,000 to $15,000,000.\nThe gown worn by the bride\nGladys Vanderbilt\nwas of ivory satin with embroidery, point lace and garlands of or\nange niossoms. ner veil was oi\npoint lace, caught with sprays of\norange blossoms. She carried a\nshower bouquet of orchids and\ngardenias.\nThe wedding gifts are said\nto exceed $1,000,000.\nMany of the most prominent\nmembers of New York society\nwere among the guests, while out\nside the Vanderbilt residence a\ngreat crowd of curious thronged\nthe sidewalk and street.\nThe young couple left Mon\nday afternoon for Newport, where\nMrs. Vanderbilt’s home, “The\nBreakers,” has been prepared for\nthem. There they will remain\nuntil February 4, when they will\nTHE BREAKERS AT NEWPORT AND COUNT\nKZKCHENYI*\nj sail lor riurope ana me uriae s new nome in Hungary.\nHolding B usiness At Goldfield\nWell, there is uo use in any of you advocates of anything-to\nget-busiuess continuing in the game. The District Attorney of Es\nmeralda County has reached the limit and is hereby officially award\ned the the grand prize. While testifying in court some days since,\nin the case of the Mine Owners Association against the Western\nFederation, the plaintiff seeking an injunction, this official sought\nto justify his official inactivity, in not prosecuting members of the\nFederation for running men out of Goldfield and for high-grading,\nby stating that the business men of that community favored high\ngrading, because it made business good and he did not care to run\ncounter to this strong public sentiment.\nThe inference also is that the Federation members who drove\npeople out of the camp were among the most successful high-grad\ners, and to put them behind the bars for any offense would “hurt\nbusiness,” and incur the displeasure of business men. On the same\ntheory highway robbery, safe cracking, assassination for hire, and\nevery other crime on the calendar can be defended. The chances,\ntoo, are that there is a trace of truth in what the County Attorney\nsays; but that is no reason why he should not be impeached and\nridden out of the community on a rail.—Ely Expositor.\nDeep Plowing and Soil Cultivation\nThe Dry Farming Congress, in session at Salt Lake last week,\nis the outgrowth of an improved system of tillage begun some years\nago in the semi-arid region of the West. This system consists, in\nbrief, of deep plowing and cultivation of the surface after rain, to\nprevent the formation of a crust and conserve the moisture in the\nsoil. Where this method of farming is followed, 12 inches of rain\nmay be made to go as far as twice that quantity, where the plowing\nis shallow and surface cultivation neglected.\nThe same principle has long been followed in the best orchards\nand vineyards of California, says the Sacramento Bee. Cultivation\ndoes not “draw the moisture to the surface,” as commonly supposed,\nbut greatly lessens evaporation by breaking up the millions of cap\nillary tubes through which moisture escapes into the air where the\nsurface soil is left hard or encrusted. Cultivation acts as a mulch\nin this respect.\nState News From Our Exchanges\nThe Boston-Ely Development\nCompany of Ely has been placed\nin the hand of a receiver.\nThe present extra session of the\nLegislature is the second in the\nhistory of Nevada, the first being\nheld in 1866.\nThe eight-year-old nephew of\nGeorge Swasey was killed Mon\nday at Yerington while playing\nwith a shotgun.\nAll Western Pacific construc\ntion work between California and\nPalisade, Nevada, has been stop\nped temporarily, owing to a short\nage of funds.

The lessees also\nagree to expend $50,000 in im\nprovements.\nS.

Nevada, January 29,-Tbe jury\nin the case of Patay Dwyer, charged\nwith the murder of A. O. Williams, at\nAustin, Lander county, last July, this\nmorning returned a verdict of not\ngnilty. Dwyer was tried at Austin,\nconvicted and sentenced to be hanged\non January 25, 1907. He took an ap\npeal, was granted a new trial and a\nchange of venue to Elko County. Al\ncoholic insanity was Dwyer's plea.\nDwyer was defended by P. A. McCar\nran, district attorney of Nye County.\nTho Shooting of William*\nPatsy Dwyer, in July of 1906, shot\nand killed Oondnotor A. O. William*\nand wounded County Clerk Dyer of\nAustin, while they were standing on a\nstreet in Austin talking.\nDwyer was drank at the time and\nwaa looking for a gambler with whom\nbe had quarreled earler in the evening.\nAfter the shooting Dwyer was ar\nrested on a charge of mnrder and tried\nin the district oonrt at Austin. In se\ncuring a jury every available citizen in\nLander county was examined before\ntwelve talesmen could be secured to try\nthe case.\nIn this case Attorneys Dennis aud\nMcCarran, who defended Dwyer, en\ntered a plea of alooholio iusanity, and\nput op a strong case for the man, who,\nin the opinion of most people ac\nquainted with the case, had committed\na deliberate murder.\nDwyer was convicted and sentenced\nto he hanged on January 25, 1907. He\nwas taken to the Nevada penitentiary\nand placed iu the death cell aud for\nmouths was constantly watched by a\nguard.\nAttorneys McCarran and Dennis ap\npealed the case, and the matter was\ncontinued irom time to time outil it\nlooked as if Dwyer would forfeit his\nlife on the gallows before the supreme\ncourt would hear the case.\nAt last, however, the attorneys for\nthe condemned man secured a hearing\nbefore the supreme oonrt and a new\ntrial was granted. Thus was Dwyer\nsnatched from the dreaded hangman’s\nBOOM.\nSheriff Morphy Fail* the Prosecution\nIn its report of the case the Elko In\ndependent makes a very bad showing\nfor Lander County's Sheriff, as follows:\nThe verdict of the jury was very largely\nbased upon the evidence of Sheriff Mur\nP*»T and Deputy Sheriff Oliver of Lan\nder County. At the former trial at\nAustin, Sheriff Murphy swore that for\nthe first ten days after the arrest of\nDwyer he seemed to be of sound mind,\nwhile Oliver was very weak on the\nquestion of Dwyer’s insanity. At the\ntrial just closed, Murphy testified that\nDwyer was of unsound mind for the\nperiod mentioned above, and Oliver in\nhis deposition was very positive that\nDwyer was insane while in his custody.\nFrom this it will be seeu that Sheriff\nMurphy made a complete change cf\nfront and threw down the prosecution\nat a very crucial poiut, and that, tor,\nwhan as we are informed, he told the\nprosecution not 30 minntes before be\nwent on the stand that in his judgment\nDwyer was sane while in his custody.\nWhy Mr. Murphy swore directly op\nposite in Elko to what he did at Austin\nIs known only to himself. It may be\nthat he was afraid to tell the truth at\nAustin, aud it may not be. But what\never the reason was, ihe fact reman s\nthat he hat sworn both ways on a cru\ncial point in the case. An effort was\nmade to impeach Oliver, but failed from\nlack of witnesses. Here, too, Sheriff\nMurphv assisted the defense by giving\nOliver a certificate of good character.\nDwyer Leave* the State\nElko Independent, Jao. 30: Patsy\nDwyer left last night with his mother\nand children for their old home in\nCanada. We understand tb t District\nAttorney Maestretti cons. 4 to bis\ngoing on condition that b- ould never\nreturn to this State. If he does, Mr.\nMaestretti informed h:.u that he would\nbe arrested and prosecuted on the iu\ndiotment hangVg over him in Lander\nCounty. If D* .tot keeps his promise.\nHevada is r*d of him forever. This is\nvery little retri out ion, however, tor the\ncrime he ooau iued.\nGovernor Sparks Signs New Police Law\nWhen the Nevada Legislature met last Monday morning there\nwas little business transacted in the Senate, but in the Assembly all\nwas bnstle and activity. The Police bill that had passed the Sen\nate the Fridav before was the first business to come up Wfore the\nHouse that morning for consideration. After the usual prelimin\naries had Wen disposed of a motion was made that the House re\nsolve itself into Committee of the Whole for the purpose of discus\nsing the Police measure.\nThe speakers for and against the bill were numerous and con\nsumed nearly the entire day in its consideration. An adjournment\nwas then taken until Tuesday morning at the usual hour.\nAfter the House had adjourned the Friday previous an informal\ncaucus was held in the Assembly ehamWr by memWrs of that body,\nwhich developed the fact that a new feature had Wen brought for\nward which if not acceded to would result in killing the bill.\nThe proposition was that unless the mine operators at Goldfield\neliminated their demands that their employes renounce the Western\nFederation of Miners and also forego the card system a large ma\njority of those friendly to the measure would vote against it in the\nAssembly.\nOn Sundav night following a meeting of the Mine Owners As\nsociation was held in Goldfield and a resolution was adopted a1>ol\nishing the card system and declaring an open camp policy. The\naction taken by the association was Wcause of the fact that the\nagreement the men were required to sign is in conflict with the\nStatutes of Nevada.\nThe plan of the operators now is to employ men regardless of\ntheir membership in any union.\nAs soon as the action taken by the mine operators Wcame\nknown no other obstacle remained in the way to prevent its passage.\nThe bill was taken up Tuesday forenoon and passed by a vote of 31\nto 7. Governor Sparks signed the measure Wednesday audit is\nnow a law of the State.\nLegislative Notes\nThe question of submitting the Police measure to a vote of the\npeople of this State through the constitution ami the iniative and\nreferendum is causing considerable debate among those interested\non either side. The referendum law passed the Nevada Legislature\nduring the session of 1901 and became a part of the constitution by\napproval of the people in 1904. This measure provides that “when\never 10 per centum of the voters shall so petition any law, passed\nby the Legislature, it shall be put to a vote of the people. If a\nmajority of tho voters signify the approval of the Act it shall stand\nas a law and shall not be annulled. W hen such majority shall sig\nnify their disapproval, the law so disapproved shall be void and of\nno effect.” Petitions are already prepared and will go out as soon\nas the Legislature adjourns.\nThe Act giving tho Attorney General the power to appoint\ndeputies in any county in Nevada to assist in prosecuting criminal\ncases was passed. The bill becomes a law as soon as the Governor\naffixes his signature. This is a bill acting in conjunction with the\nPolice measure, and to insist in the prosecution of the criminal\nelement at Goldfield.\nGovernor Sparks has announced that he will appoint Capt. W.\nL. Cox of Reno as superintendent of the new State police system.\nBoth Houses of the Legislature decided to adjourn Saturday,\nthe 20-day limit expiring the following day, Sunday.\nGovernment Starts Suit Against Harriman\nWashington, D. C., January 25—Attorney General Bonaparte\nto-day directed that a bill in equity be filed to set aside the control\nby the Union Pacific Railroad Company and its subsidiary corpora\ntions of the Southern Pacific and the San Pedro, Los Angeles and\nSalt Lake road; also to have declared illegal the ownership by the\nUnion Pacific or the Oregon Short Line of stock in the Sante Fe,\nthe Great Northern, and Northern Pacific, all of said lines being\ncompetitors of the Union Pacific.\nThe Attorney General to-day issued an official statement to this\neffect, and after referring to the extended investigation by the Inter\nstate Commerce Commission into the relations existing between the\nvarious lines of road engaged in trans-continental traffic, says:\n“From the evidence so adduced and from independent investi\ngation, the Department has arrived at the conclusion that the stock\nholdings of the Union Pacific and its subsidiary company in the\nother corporations mentioned above is in direct violation of the\nSherman Act.\nSuit Against a Monopoly\n“The Department regards the suit as of first importance, as it\nis sought by means thereof to break up a substantial monopoly the of\ntransportation business of the country between the Missouri river\non the east and the entire Pacific Coast south of Portland oBthe west.\n“Aside from the railway companies above named, the other de\nfendants in the suit are the Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company of\nNew York, which is the depository of all the stock of the San Pedro\nroad under a contract by which it is required to give proxies to such\npersons as may be named by Mr. Harriman and Mr. Clark for a pe\nriod of years. There are also the following individual defendants\nwho are alleged to have conceived and carried out the conspiracy\ncomplained of, to-wit: E. H. Harriman, Jacob H. Schiff, Otto H.\nKahn, James Stillman, Henry C. Frick, Henry H. Rogers and Wil\nliam A. Clark.”\nThe Great Railroad Merger*\nThe beginning of the Government suit to dissolve the Harriman\nmerger brings into strong relief the extent to which the railroads of\nthe country have been grouped in few hands. The Harriman sys\ntem is the greatest in mileage and is surpassed in capitalization only\nby the Pennsylvania system. The great railroads are grouped as\nto control as follows:\nSystem— Miles Stocks Bonds\nHarriman. 22,276 $009,000,000 $625,270,000\nVanderbilt. 20,493 496,000,000 662,500,000\nPennsylvania. 20,138 751,000,000 69 ,000,000\nHill-Morgan ... 19.407 495,000.000 269,000,000\nMorgan . 18,879 297,500,000 279,500,000\nGould ... 13,879 264,760,000 333,200,000\nMoore Bros. 18,028 422,000,000 180,000,000\nRockefeller. 10,293 198,000,000 372,000,000\nSanteFe. 7,809 216,000,000 225,000,000\nTotals.146.082 $3,827,000,000 $8,626,000,000\nThe Wells, Elko County, Herald says: “The verdict of the\njury in the Dwyer case is an invitation to the murderers of the\nwhole State to ask that their cases be venued to Elko County.”\n'death boll\n•> *m L - I\nTHE perils of mining In the coal\nregions of the United States\nhave been exemplified In so\nmany ways recently that the\nsubject has attracted general attention\nand has been made a subject of special\ninquiry by the federal authorities. The\nnatter Is one that comes under the ju\nrisdiction of the secretary of the In\nterior, James It. Garfield. It was at\nhis request that officers of the United\nStates geological survey liegan an in\nvestigation almnt six months ago rela\ntive to the enforcement of laws passed\nby congress for the better protection of\nTIVRIK) FOR FIBE DAlfT.\nworkers In coal mines in the territories.\nIn thla connection Mr. Garfield said.\n“It la suggested that the officers of the\ngeological survey having the matter In\ncharge should not only Investigate the\ngeneral mining conditions in the terri\ntories, but also the nature and extent\nof miue accidents, particularly those re\nsulting from explosions, and report to\nthe department the results of such In\nvestigations. These should contain also\nsuggestions as to how mining condi\ntions may be Improved and accidents\nprevented without undue hardship to\nthe operators.” In view of the broad\nnature of their instructions the officers\nof the survey delegated to the task did\nnot confine their examination to the\ncoal mining regions of the territories,\nbut, in addition to their work there,\nhave been Investigating the nature, ex\ntent, causes and results of disastrous\nmine explosions lu several states.\nIt is In the cqal mines of the Alle\nghany mountain region that the worst\naccidents have recently occurred. One\nof the most awful of these disasters—\nlu fact, one of the most dreadful catas\ntrophies In the history of mining was\nthe explosion and fire In the Fairmont\nmines at Mouongah, In the coal region\nof West Virginia, on Pec. 0. In this\ncase a shot blew open a pocket of gas,\nwhich exploded, wrecking tlio giant\nfan that was used to drive foul air\nout of the mine. The wrecking of the\nfan was one of the worst features of\nthe accident, for with this out of com\nmission tbe fatal pfterdamp accumu\nlated lu nil the galleries, uud the men\nImprisoned were smothered to death\nby the hundred almost Instantly. Ites\ncue work was nearly hopeless under\nthese circumstances. It was death to\nenter the mines fu the absence of ven\ntilation, and the destruction of the fan\nmeant delay In the work of getting out\nany men who might still be living un\ntil tbe galleries couiil be cleared of tbe\npoisonous fumes. then when a new\nfan was set up fire drove back the\ncourageous rescuers. It has been es\ntimated that 25b lives were lost In this\ncatastrophe. This meant the practical\ndepopulation of the community so fai\nas the male element was concerned\nthe breadwinners of the town. Tin\nexplosion made about 1,000 children\nfatherless. The president of the Con\nsolidated Coal company of Baltimore\nwhich owns the mines, will erect an\norphan asylum at Monongah for them\nIt was only a few days before tin\ndisaster nt Xtonongah that an explo\nsion occurred In the Naomi mine of the\nUnited Coal company, situated three\nmiles west of Fayette City, Pa., and\nthirty miles from Pittsburg It was\n8 p. nt. on Dee. 1 that those living In\nthe vicinity of the mine heard the\nsounds which told them news the\ndreed character of which they Hppre\nstated only too well. The miners at\nWork at the time were supposed to\nbare numbered fifty, and over thirty\ncharred bodies were taken out of the\nmine. I-ess than twenty men were\nleft alive In the little village of Naomi.\nSeveral of these bad declined to work\nthat day because It was Sunday. Oth\ners who had attempted to enter the\nmine were turned hack because they\nwr-f Intoxicated.\nThe Naomi mine disaster furnished\nan Instance of the strange and Kid\nthlugs that happen in connection with\nsuch mining accidents. Cue of the be\nreaved women at Naomi was Mrs\nJohn p. Harry, who lost husband and\nthree sons In the explosion. The entire\nfamily were about to return to their\nmother country, England, and bad\neven engaged their steamship passage\nAbout a week after the disaster of\nthe Monongah mines an explosion look\nplace in mine No. 1 of the Tolande\nCoal and Coke company, near Birming\nham, Ala. The death list was placed at\nseventy. On Pec. 1!) a terrific explo\nsion shook the Parr mines of the Pitts\nburg Coal company nt Jacobs Creek, on\nthe Youghiegheny river, eighteen miles\nwest of Counellsville, l’a., announcing\nto the surrounding community tnat\nthere had been a great convulsion of\nsome kind beneath the surface.\nThe mouth of the mine was wrecked,\nand this, In connection with the tire\nwhich wa; discovered to be raging In\nside, prevented for a time any attempt\nto reach the men imprisoned within.\nSome 400 men were employed In t lie\nmine, and a large proportion of them\nperished. On Dec. iiil lire broke out In\na mine ut Baird Station, near Pitls\nburg, and 100 men narrowly escaped\ncremation.\nThe seriousness of the danger to coal\nminers so Impressed President Roose\nvelt that he called social attention to\nthe matter In his last message to con\ngress, recommending the establishment\nIn the Interior department of a bureau\nof mines, one of the functions of which\nshould !>e the minimizing of the dan\ngers Incident to the Industry.\nThe Investigation authorized by Sec\nretary Garfield Is still proceeding, but\na preliminary repqrt has !>eeu made.\nSome of the figures of this report are\nst«rtllng. In the coal mines of the\nUnited States In 1900 0,801 men were\nkilled or Injured, the number killed\nbeing 2.001 and the number Injured\n4,800. The statistics for 1907 are not\nyet available, hut It Is expected they\nwill be more startling than thoso for\nthe preceding year. The total number\nkilled since 1889, as shown In a table\ncompiled by the Investigators, Is JJ2,\n840, And the most painful feature of\nIt Is that the number of fatal accidents\nIs Increasing. There are twice as\nmany each year now as ten years ago.\nThis Is thought to be due In part to\nthe large Increase In the production of\ncoal, but the fact that In Europe they\ndo not have us many accidents as In\nthis country is suggestive. In Euro\npean coul producing countries the out\nf)Ut of coal has been Increasing great\n,y during toe past teu years, but the\nnumber of deaths per 1,000 miners, In\nstead of Increasing, as in the United\nStates, has undergone a marked de\nprease. The federal Investigators at\ntribute this to the effect of mining leg\nIslatlou and the establishment of safe\nguards made possible through the work\nOf testing stations for the study of\nproblems relative to safety In mining.\nStamps Dropping in Nevada’\nDaring the year 1007, owing to the\nnamber nod extent of the many rich\ngold strikes made in nearly every\noonnty in Nevada, the attention of the\ngeneral pnbho Las been diverted from *\nthe knowledge of the fall namber of\nredaction plants in operation in this\nState.

One can scarcely pick op\na newspaper published in Nevada that\ndoes not oontain glowing accounts of\nthe extent and richness of its mineral\ndeposits.\nSam C. Dondam, editor of the Toro\npah Miner, who has jnst returned from\nihe new camp, writing of conditions\n\'here, says:\nThere seems to be everything in Raw\nhide bat ready money. There are in\nthe neighborhood of 3000 people—tot\nmany for the present time. Rawhide i>\nno poor mao’s country, exoept for those,\nperhaps, who want to work leases; bat\nthe good leases are soaroe at the present\ntime, and there is little for a man to do\notherwise, and less money to pay him\nfor it. Still the oamp goes on growing,\nand the price of real estate and mining\nproperties soar to high levels. Most of\nthe money that is to be seen in the\ncamp is brought in by the transients.\nThe Tonopah Bonanza of last Tues\nday contained a column write-np of\nRawhide. Among the personal men\ntion in the article we Bud the following\nreference to a yonng man who was a\nresident of Eureka a few years ago:\nClarence Kind, who with his associ\nates, has one-sixth interest iu the Royal\nand Tiger group, was yesterday offered\n$50,000 for the interest which he re\nfused. The offer was made by O. J.\nBlumeuthal, who said that the money\nwonld be forthcoming, and the flrst\npayment be made immediately, if Kind\nshould agree.\n“We are willing to take the chances\nof there being a mine th -re as well as\nanybody else," responded Kind, and\nthat is all that con\'d be got out of him.\nBlumentbal repeated the offer several\ntimes but there was nothing doing. It\nwas on the Royal claim of this group\nthat Stiosou had bis lease, which he\nsold on Sunday last for $25,000, and the\nleaso has only 10 months to ran.\nGRIFF GRIFFITHS AS REFORMER\nUrges That the Disclipine Now\nEnforced In \'Penitentaries\nShould Be Changed\nMillionaire Griffith J. Griffiths, who\nwill be remembered by old-time Eure\nkuna as superintendent of the Wales\nConsolidated Company’s property on\nRuby Hill, and who left here about 25\nyears ago, is now taking a leading part\nin an effort to reform the crnel disci\npline in force in the average peniten\ntiary.\nMr. Giiffiths speaks from experience,\nhaving bat recently completed a two\nyear term in the San Qaentin, Cali\nfornia, penitentiary for shootiug and\nseriously wounding bis wife.\nHe made a stiriog appeal for a more\nhuman treatment of criminals in per\nsons in a lectnre delivered at Calvary\nPresbyterian Church in San Francisco,\nSunday, January 29. Among bis list\neners were 65 ex-couviots. The follow\ning extracts from bis discourse cover the\npoiucipal points made in his argument\non penitentiary discipline reform :\n"From personal experience and know\nledge," said Mr. Griffiths, I am forced\nto the conclusion that the discipline of\nthe average prison hardens, degrades\nand is a perpetual exhibition of cruel,\narbitrary power, In many of the pen\nitentiaries there are instruments of tor\nture ann now and then a oonviot is crip\npled for life or murdered.\n"Inspections and investigations go for\nnaught because the testimony of a con\nvict goes unbelieved. lie is generally\nprevented by nil rear from telling ms\nwrongs, for if he speaks he is not be\nlieved—he is regarded as less than a\nbnman being, and so the imprisoned\nsntfer and remain without remedy.”\nThe speaker then described at some\nlength the laws in force at the Elmira\nReformatory in New York, whioh have\nbeen adopted in several States for the\nreformatories within their bounds. He\ndeclared that the bedrock of this new\npenologicol system was the incontro\nvertible fact that the violator of law oau\nbe reformed, and that the most effective\nway to protect sooiety is to reform the\ncriminal. Reformation and not retri\nbution, therefore, should be the chief\nend of punishment.\nMr. Griffiths then went into the El\nmira system at some length, drawing\nmany good examples to be followed by\nCalifornia which he olaims is far be\nhind other State* in modern prison\nmethods.

Elliot of Harvard University in a speech\nat the banquet of the National Society for the promotion of indi\nvidual education held at the Auditorium, Chicago, January 25, said\nthat boys and girls should be sorted out by their teachers and forced\nby law to study trades assigned to them. The proposition is report\ned to have caused a sensation among those who heard him.\nThe Reno Journal publishes the views of several clergymen and\neducators on the question, one of the latter being Professor R E.\nWinfrey, who at one time was principal of the Eureka public school,\nand holds a similar position in the High School at Beno at the pres\nent time. Mr. Winfrey’s opinion on the subject is as follows:\n“As far as teachers being given the power to determine what\neach child is fitted for, I don’t think the teacher can say. In my\nown experience I have often tried to find out what pupils are best\nadapted for, but very rarely have I been able to determine to my\nsatisfaction. In fact the pupils don’t know themselves what field\nof work they desire to take up until they get into the last ye-rs of\nHigh School. In the teacher’s experience with children he seldom\nhas an opportunity to find much about their abilities except along\nthe lines of the curriculum. I know of one case that puzzled me a\nlong time, of a boy who did not seem good for anything in particular\nin school, until I accidentally discovered that he had a little machine\nshop of his own at home and was an enthusiastic worker in mechanics.\n“The teacher would not be as competent to judge of a boy’s fu\nture as his parents, and they perhaps would find themselves wrong\nafter the boy himself exercised his judgment and chose his career.\n“One thing I have always advocated is the establishing of a\nmanual training course in the schools, although I would not go so far\nas to suggest the teaching of specific trades. Children should be\ntaught to use tools and the girls should learn to cook and to sew.\nBeginning with the sixth grade a course of manual training should\nbegin extending through the High School.”\nSacramento Union: Government scientists are ont in an offi\ncial bulletin declaring that Burbank’s spineless cactus is uneconomic,\nwill not thrive on the desert, and is no better for food than tho\nspined cactus.

According to the observa\ntions of Minister Bryan, the kingdom\nKINO CARLOS AND "DICTATOR\'’ FRANCO.\nIn general Is In n condl ilou of tran\nquillity. Nevertheless, !n the opinion\nof competent judges of the situation,\nPortugal Is passing through a history\nmaking epoch. There has lieen a re\nvolt against graft, and It is said that\nuntil a halt was called in this direction\nabuses nourished which surpassed\neven the revelations of similar evils In\nthe most graft ridden cities of the\nUnited States. The conditions would\nhave soon brought the country to hank\nruptcy. Among concerns whic h profited\nfrom the graft system was the tobacco\nmonopoly, and conditions at last be\ncame so had that early In 190C1 the\npeople Invaded the chambers of parlia\nment. and throughout the laud the cry\nwas heard "Down with the tobacco\ngovernment!” It was then the fat and\njovial Don Carlos placed the reins of\ngovernment In the hands of the so\ncalled “regenerators.” The tobacco ques\ntion was settled, and others came up\nfor treatment In a similar manner.\nThe anger of the people at the condl\ntlons existing caused many disorders,\nand the premier, Kebelro, applied to the\nking for extraordinary powers, but the\nmonarch saw fit not to confer such\npowers on either Kebelro or the leader\nof the opposite party. Instead, he call\ned In Senor Joao Franco, almost an\noutxlder, and gave him the desired un\nusual powers. He Is now spoken of\nas dictator, but he claims that his pow\ners are exercised with a view of\nstraightening out the financial tangle,\nabolishing abuses and giving the peo\npie an honest and efficient government.\nHe Is a Liberal leader, Is about fifty\nyears old.

At Cascaes\n(luring the bathlug season his residence\nIs a homely villa close to the royal cita\ndel, and Its sole luxury Is a piano.\nThe political parties and their repre\nsentatives In parliament had become\nvery corrupt. Although both houses of\nparliament have been dismissed and no\nlate has been set for new elections\nmd although the most violent \'if the\norgans of the antagonistic parties have\nbeen suspended, it Is said that the peo\nple of the country In general do not ob\nject so much to the dictatorship of\nFranco as they did to the rule of graft.\nStrange conditions have been created\nin the royal family by the establish\nment of the dictatorship. For years\nthe royal house has been in such a\ncondition of penury that it has been\nreduced to all sorts of sbiftB and ex\npedients. Forty years ago It had to\nsell the crown Jewels and later to mort- \'\ngage the crown lands. Then the king\nhad to appeal for advances from the\ntreasury.

The latter stop\nped the graft, liquidated the royal debt\nby decree. Increased the civil list and\nput into operation a system of account\nability which would cud the practice\nof making advances to the king. Ills\nmeasures aroused great opposition in\nmany quarters, and the young crown\nprince, I.nlz Philippe, took sides against\nIlls father and Dictator Franco. There\nhave been rumors that he has ‘ «en on\nthis account exiled to the royal Hunting\nlodge at Villa Vlclosa. The spouse of\nDon Carlos, the beautiful, clever anil\nIntellectual Queen Marie Amelle, has\nrecently been visiting England to at\ntend the marringe of her sister to\nPrince Charles of Bourbon.

The traditional policy of si\nlenc and secretiveness lias iieen ex\nchanged for one of openness and confi\ndence. As a result the Standard Is\nnow replying to attacks made upon its\nconduct of its affairs and is seeking\npublic favor, whereas In the past Its\npolicy was to Ignore such assaults and\nlo assume Indifference as to what the\npublic might think of its acts and the\nplan of Its operations. \\\\ ith tins\nchange in policy it is not so difficult as\nIt once was to learn about the coin\nings and goings and the personal char\nacteristics of the men at the head\nof the Standard\'s management.

Then came j\nthe oil boom, nnd with characteristic\nprescience the young man invested ev- ,\nery dollar he could save or borrow in j\nthat business. As n young independ\nent operator he at first fought John I>.\nRockefeller nnd his South Improve\nment company scheme, the first at\ntempt at monopoly, but later came Into\nthe Standard through the Acme Oil\ncompany, *a subsidiary of the trust,\nand for his work In its development\nhe tiecame one of the Standard lend\ners.

Had the exhumation so\nragerly awaited by the public revealed\nthe fact that lead was placed in the\ncasket instead of a corpse the conten\ntlon of the claimant that Druce and\nthe fifth Duke of Portland were one\nand the same person would have re\nreived the strongest sort of confirms\ntion. But the bottom dropped out of\nthe case of George Hollamby Druce\ncompletely when the \' pening of the\ntomb showed that the cottln coutaino\nthe remains of an aged, bearded man\njust such a man as Thomas Charlc\nDruce was lu his last days.\nThe plausibility of the Druce claim\ndepended largely on the sworn state\nment of an American, ltotiert C. Cald\nwell, that he had been a party to a\nmock funeral and bad witnessed the\nplacing of lead lu tbe supposed coffin\nof Druce.\nCaldwell testified In court that he\nhn«l known Druce, the bazaar keei>er.\nand that he was in reality tbe fifth\nDuke of Portland. He bad known the\nItOI.EKT C. CALLlWKLE.\nduke under l>oth names, he said, anu\nhad arranged the pretended death and\nfuuersil at the duke\'s request. He\nswore that the coffin contained Instead\nof a body a roll of lead weighing iioo\npounds. In consequence of his testi\nmony he is under u charge of i>orjury.\nand when he landed in New York re\ncently he was arrested, but was re\nleased ou bail and permitted to go to\nhis home in Staten Island, where, it\nwas afterward said, be was quite 111\nCaldwell figured some years ago la\nthe A.
