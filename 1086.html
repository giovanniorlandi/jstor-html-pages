Frank Frantz,\n"Guthrie, Oklahoma.\n"Sir: After three weeks of the\nmost vicious and filthy u:ud-slinglng\nby your party and hired allies, which\nis a tissue of falsehood from beginning\nto end, I, at Shawnee, made six\ncharges against you which you have\nso far wholly failed to deny. The only\ndefense made your pecple is the whin- J\nng claim that Haskell is actually\nslinging mud at you. They seem to\nhave forgotten the villainous conduct\nof your party.\n".Now, you have added to your list\nof hirelings, one John M. Sheets of\nOhio, who comes a thousand miles.\n"You still persist in avoiding me\nand making charges against me in my\nabsence anj where I have no opporun\nity to refute your charges or to ask\nyou to explain your own improper\npersonal official conduct.\n"Next Saturday at 1 o\'clock, I speak\nn your home city of Guthrie, and\nthere shall take up all the charges you\nand your hirelings have made against\nme and show their utter falsity. If\nyou have a particle of courage or man\nhood about you, you will accept the\niLTiU\'lon which I herewith gUe you:\nthat you and Sheets both be present;\nONLY OfJE STATE BANK\nFAILS IM 18 MOUTHS\nGuthrie, Sept. 10.

Smock, territorial tank commis\nsioner today. .\n"Two other state banks have closed\ntheir doors, but were subsequently\nable to pay their depositors. There\nhas not been a bank failure in Okla\nhoma among state banks since last\nMay. The fact that all the banks\nhave been able to go through the sum-\n! months safely indicates that Oklaho\nma is in excellent condition finan\ncially." Commissioner Smock today author\nized the First State Bank of Goodwell,\nin Beaver county, to begin business\nwith a capital stock of $10,000. The\nofficers are: J. R. P. Sewell, president;\nD. G. Jackson, vice president, and\nFrank A. Sewell, cashier.\nA SPECIAL SESSSO\nOf the City Council Was Held Last\nNight.

But in trie case of "The\nIrish Senator" the public will have\nthe pleasure of seeing a play written\nin an entirely new line. The comedy\nis asiccess everywhere.\nOwing to the fact that no regular\nsession of the city council was held\nlast week, a special meeting was called\nlast night to allow the claims of em\nployes in the street department and\nconsider applications for permits to\nlay sewer pipes in the block occupied\nby the Catholic church property and\nou Second street east of the \'Katy\ntracks. The permits were granted.\nThe Mayor was authorized to notify\nall parties desiring to do plumbing\nwork within the city limits must pass\nan examination and procure a license\nbefore going to work. The fee for\nthis license is $12 a year.\nA number of slaims agiinst the city\nwere allowed and warrants ordered\ndrawn for the payment of same.\nThe committee appointed to draft\nan ordinance covering street paving,\nsidewalk building and other improve\nments asked for and was granted more\ntime.\nAn ordinance exempting the Audi\ntorium and plaza from taxation in i\nconsideration of the privlllcge given\nthe city to use the building for all\npublic meetings was placed on its fir\nreading.\nHarmony prevailed last night to a\ngreater degree than at any previous\nmeeting of the council for many\nmonths.\nAdjourned to meet in regular bi\nmonthly session next Tuesday night,\nat which time it is hoped the improve\nments ordinance will be reported, as\nthe city administration is very desir\nous of starting the work of paving as\nsoon as possible.\nG0T10H CROP SHORT\nThe Annual Bulletin Shows a Big\nFalling Off Over Last Year\nCrop Very Late.\nWashington, Sept. 10 -The census\nbureau bulletin issued yesterday morn\ning from the ginners shows a total\ncotton report up to September 1 to be\n101,466 bales, compared with 407,551\nbales up to the same period last year.\nThe falling off is attributed to the\nUtenessofthe crop.
