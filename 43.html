When this\nis completed the balance of the\npr.\'jejt will be thrown on the\nmarket. There are about 1 (>0,000\nacres remaining unsold. There\nis being farmed at the present time\nsomething over 80,000 acres.\nSome of this has been intensely\ncultivated with remarkable results.\nFor instance, seventy-one acres\nof rtlfaifa produced last year seven\nhundred tons in three cuttings.\nThe land and hay were measured\nby government surveyors. Po-|\ntntoes have produced better than\nfifteen tons to the acre. Onions\nI\nhave produced over twenty tons to\nthe a tp. Wheat, barley and rats\nhave produced over one and a half\ntons to the acre. Mr. Vannoy of\nKallon is raising the best celeiy i.t\nthe market of the Pacific Coast.\nApples, pears, peaches, apricots and\nsmall fruit are being raised\nsuccessfully. Their quality is\nexcellent and by the use of smudge\npots the crop is assured every\nyear. What is being done on the\nCnrson-Truckee project can be done\nin many other valleys of the state\nby the application of sufficient\nwater. The state of Nevada has\nat least three milion acres of rich\nlland that enn be irrigated either\nby conserving the water in reser\nvoirs, by artesian wells or by\npumping\nThis land by intensive farming\ncan be made to produce an aveiage\ngross value per acre of one hun\ndollars, giving an annu al\nome on the above three million\nnficres of three hundred million\ndollars.\nWe have an abundant and an\never increasing market in Cali\nfornia for our ex\'tra products.\nNevada onions are the best in\nthe market and with the great\n| p isiibilcies of onion raising in\npirts of the state where they may\nbe profitably grown thry can and\nwill be shipped to the eastern\nmarket where there is a great\ndemand for them as soon as Ne\nvada can raise enough to suppl the\ndemand. The Pacific Coast is\nto ue greatly benefitted by the\nopening of the Panama canal in\n1915 an 1 a market will be made in\nEuropean cities for American\nproducts ma.le impossible now by\nthe excessive freight transpotation.\nWith the glorious future before1\nthe Pacific Coast, Nevada is gring\nto reap no small share of the\nbenefit when the Pacific ccean\nbecomes the highway of commerce\nthat the Atlantic is at th? present\ntime. A^ain with the develop\nment of the Orient and the\nawakening of the Eastern natiors\nwe are going to con.e in close\ntouch with the centers of civil i\nzation in the world.

In the course of\nthis examination he admitted\nabout 50 per cent of one of the\nstatements in the let er was a\nlie. He was then afked if 50 per\ncent of his evidence was not of the\nsame character.

Voltaire, who some time\nago acquired a tract of land just\neast of town and is now cultivat\ninn a large portion of the land by\nthe so-called dry farming methods,\nis very much pleased with the\nresults so far obtained. He states\nthat all tne crops that he planted\nthis season are doing fine without\nirrigation, depending entirely on\nwhat rain falls and the moisture of\nthe ground. Potatoes are up\nfrom eight to ten inches high,\nsquash vines are about ready to\nrun and a trial set of alfalfa hay\nI is three inches high and gives\nI every evidence of maturing.\n| Other vegetables that he has\nplanted are looking well and he\nbelieves that his project is going\nto be a grand success. On account\nof the land not being fenced, Mr.\nVoltaire says he has had consider*\nable trouble with the rabbits in his\ngarden, but he says this will be\novercome when the land is fenced.\nIn speaking of dry farming in\ngeneral Mr. Voltaire states that if\nthe seed recommended by the\ngovernment is used he brieves\nthat dry farming will be made a\nsuccess in many sections through\nout the state. ?

Cor\nrespondingly, too, he is entitled\nto several billons dollars cf said\nmined in British South Africa and\nWest Africa, Australia, India,\nBritish East Indies and Guiana,\nCanada, etc, in the past hundred\nyears or more, during which time\nthe crown has neglected to assert\nits statutory rifrhts.\nIt seems safe to assume that\nnever in the future will these\nstatu tory rights be asserted. The\nupheaval of the British Empire\nwould be 3lmcst certain. The\nopposition of the colonies would\nbe enorm.us as well as well eon- \'\ncerted, for manifest reasons; nor\nwould the opposition in England j\nitself be less pronounced, consider- \\\ning that hundreds of millions of\ndollars of coal and Iron machinery,\nfood products and clothing are\nshipped annually to British mining\ncolonies, and that this trade would\nbe deleteriously affected.\nThe statute is a relic of\nmedieval ages. It was in those\ndays considered that the possesion\nof the sources of gold in other\nhands than those of the sovereign\nwould be a contir\'-al and\nthreatening source of danger to\nthe king and to the safety of the\nnation. Today the greatst source |\nof danger to any nation would lie\nin concentrating in the hands of\nits executive a yearly output on\ngold as colossal as is that of the\nBritish dominions, amounting,\nindeed, in 1910 to 58 per cent of\nthe gold output of the entire\nworld.?

Petween two ar.d\nthree o\'clock this morning, young\nMorley went out of tha house for\na few minutes and on returning to\nhis bedroom met his brother, who\nmistook him for a burglar and shot\nhim, killing him instantly. ? Ely\nRecord.\nSOME STARTLING FACTS\nA very interesting address was\ngiven at the Presbyteron church\nlast nighi by Hon. A R. Merritt\nof Churhill county concerning his\nexperiences at the last session of\nthe state leghlature and the\nnecessity for future n form\nmeasures and progrssive legislation\nin the state. He spoke very\nforcibly concenirg the divorce evils\nin Nevada and presented facts that\nwere astounding to the audience.\nHe quoted authoriy for his figures\nin every instance.\nIn the course of hip remarks, he\nstated that during the part three\nyears there have been 2200\ndivorces granted in Reno. Only\nten of these were native Ne\nvadans. There are 886 now\nrcgisterd for divorce in the city.\nHe also [stated on authority that\nno divorce ease would in the\nfuture he handled by nny attorney\nfor less than two hundred and fifty\ndollars. Of the 886 now registered\nfor divorcc only 20 of the number\nare men. They consist mostly of\nwomen who have married in the\nwealthy families of the east and in\nmany cases lead fast lives. Their\npresence in Keno is damaging to\nthe youth of tho city and injurious\nio the best Interests of the State\nUniversity.\nMr. Merrit drew the conclusion\nthat the people of Nevada shoua be\nan J are entitled to a better name\nthan they b*?ar because of the\nentire number of applicants for\ndivorce only a comparatively few\nare from out state, but that we\nbe.ome the dumping ground of the\nmoraldegenerates, whatever may be\nthe class of society from which they\nhail, from the eastern states.\nTHE IL SMITH CASE\nSaturday\'s Or?nn News says:\nYesterda/ morining in the\nsuprtme court the Oscar J. Smith\nhabeas cornus case was taken up.\nFormer Cashier Gorman of the\nEureka County Hank was placed\nupon the stand to testify as to the\nfeeling of the people of Lurtka\ncounty toward the officials of the\nbank. He stated that the feeling\nin that section was strong against\nall the officials and that this feeling\nwas shired by Judge Breen, who\nupon the stump in that county\nmade statements showing his\nfeelings in reply to remarks made\nby Denver S. Dirkorsm in his\ncampaign.\nFollowing the taking of the !\ntestimony of Mr. Gorman, Attorney\nGlynn made a lengthy address in\nhehalf of Smith and was followed >\nin the afternoon by Attorney Brown\nfor Judge Moran. I\nFAIR TRADE NO ROBBERY\nSeme of the up state excnat.gos\nhave been agitating the proposi\ntion of annexing that part of Cali\nfornia lying east of the summit of\nthe Sierras to the state of Nevada,\nclaiming that that section has\nnothing in common with the rest\nof Cilifornia and that its interests\ncould be much better looked after\nby the sovereign state of Neva da.\nNow, when it comes to slicing\nup slates we are up against a hard\nproposition, but while we are at it,\nwe might as well el op c fT the\n"golden triangle" and add it to\nCalifornia. This would make fair\nexchange, and might work to the\nadvantage of this section.\nWe do all our business with Cali\nfornia. We have to go to Cali\nfornia to get out of heri, even\nto go to the county stat. Our mail\nto the rest of the state, even\nCre3ca.it so.ne sixteen miles away,\nis carried as far in reaching its\ndestination as is our mail to Los\nAngeles, and mail to Carson City,\nthe state capita!, must travel\nfurther than mail sent to San\nFrancisco.

A citizen\nof Reno recently, received a ropy\nof the Berlin Zeitung forwarded to\nhim by relatives vvhicn contained |\nan interesting aritcle on the |\n?\'ivorce laws of Nevada as viewed j\nby the Teutonic writer.
