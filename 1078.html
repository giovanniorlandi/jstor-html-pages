T.\n10 Cents\n. . . .40 Cents\nNo. 44\nOctober 13\nVinita has gone the limit on the bond issues, and her\nrate of taxation lias also touched the top notch. One\nelephant at a time is enough to carry. ,\nIf there is anything else to go into the Sequoyah con\nstitution just name it, or forever hold your peace.\nTilings are not so dark as they seem. It is only a lit\ntle more than five months until the business administra\ntion will go out of business. No flowers,\nThe state of Oregon is in rather a bad plight. It\'s\ntwo senators and one of its two .congressmen have been\nconvicted of fraud in a federal court.\nSwords for plowshares make poor harvests. It is not\nsurprising to learn that Russia\'s wheat crop is\nshort a hundred and eighty million bushels.\nMen who run for office in Vinita on some miserable\nmakeshift of a political platform and then feel bound by\nit \'to the injury of the city are unworthy of support in\nauy public capacity. What the business interests of\nVinita demands at this juncture is a little common sense\nand less petty politics. \'\nOne of the best features of the Carnival, and one that\nwill be thoroughly appreciated, will be the statehood\ndebate Thursday evening from the band stand near the\npublic fountain. W. W. Hastings and C. N. Ilaskill will\npresent the separate state side while II. II. Howard, of\nOklahoma City, and r.L. Soper, of Vinita, will take cara\nof the joint state side.\nThe Creek council displayed more common sense when\nit refused to be coerced into endorsing the separate state\nconstitution than was expected. The now defunct Chero\nkee council should take a tumble to itself.\nThe presumption is that Judge Raymond has given\nup all hope of succeeding himself as United States judge\nof the Western district. L. F. Parker, jr., of Vinita\nstands a good show of getting the place if he wants it.\nThe president of a bank, when asked by a young clerk\nhow lie could distinguish bad bills from good ones, said,\n"Get acquainted with the good bills, and you will recog\nnize the bad bill at sight." The principle upon which\nthis advice is based is so sound that it ought to be more\nwidely applied in practice. When one knows all there is\nto know about flrst-jjrade corn or wheat or potatoes or\nsheep or cotton, he can detect at sight everything that\ndoes not come up to the standard. One who is fully oc\nC ipied doing the right thing will have no difficulty in\nrefraining from the wrong.\n:FrnkXin-WiUiatu.\nWalter O. Williams, of Centerville,,\nIowa, akd Miss Dora Franklin were\nunited in marriage at the home of the\nbride\'s parents in this city last even\ning at 8 o\'clock, Dr. II. II. Watson offi\nciating. Quite a number of friends\nwere present and some very handsome\npresents were received.\nStray Cow.\nOne ,dun, muley cow, 8 or 10 years\nold; miderbit in right ear; no brands.\nCame to my place about Oct. 1, l\'JOl,.\nand has been there ever since, one calf\nbeing born to her since comir- there.\nEdmund Blytii, 4 four miles north\nof Spaninaw, miles east of Chaffee.\nw 7-l\ny\nk\nV f\nA TIN BOX\nFaith not Necessary.\nYou may be just as skeptical and\npessimistic as you piease.
