We explored correlates of\nPTSD in the Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers military dataset to evaluate contrasting\naccounts of the relationship between early adversity and PTSD. The standard deficit model depicts\nontogeny as inherently vulnerable to insult, such that early adversity yields a less robust adult phenotype.\nA complementary life history theory account holds that adverse early experiences cue a fast life history\norientation that reduces investment in maintenance, yielding an adult phenotype less able to recover\nfrom trauma. An opposing life history theory account holds that early adversity cues expectations of an\nadverse adult environment, adaptively reducing reactivity to adverse events. We use principal component\nanalysis to extract a latent variable representing several childhood experiences and multiple lifestyle factors\nthat plausibly proxy life history orientation. After correcting for covariates, we find a strong positive influence\nof such proxies on PTSD risk, suggesting that early adversity may indeed increase risk for PTSD, and\nthus that either the standard deficit model, the reduced maintenance account or a combination are correct.\nKeywords: Life history theory; Posttraumatic stress disorder; evolutionary medicine\nSocial media summary: Early adversity and related adult lifestyle factors increase susceptibility to\nposttraumatic stress disorder among US soldiers.\nIntroduction\nAnxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the USA. Over 8 million Americans suffer\nfrom posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 6.8% of the population will develop PTSD at some time in\ntheir lives (Dückers et al., 2016). PTSD can be understood as a disorder of evolved defensive reactions\nfollowing exposure to trauma (Cantor, 2009). Indeed, consistent with the condition’s being rooted in\nspecies-typical psychology, despite some variation, it occurs across widely divergent sociocultural and\necological contexts (Zefferman & Mathew, 2021).\nWhile trauma exposure is definitional to PTSD, there is nevertheless substantial inter-individual\nvariation in the extent to which such experiences result in the condition. According to the DSM-5,\npre-trauma risk factors include prior mental disorders, lower socioeconomic status, childhood adversity,\nminority racial status and reduced social support (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).\nRisk is higher among females and younger adults. These individual factors predisposing PTSD risk support\nthe deficit model of PTSD wherein one’s ability to emotionally process a traumatic experience is\ndebilitated by early adversity, resulting in dysregulated, overactive coping mechanisms persisting beyond\n© The Author(s), 2022.

This construal of adversity as cumulatively damaging\nor hindering an individual’s cognitive and emotional capacity for coping with potentially traumatic\nexperiences is a component of all major existing theories and perspectives on PTSD etiology.\nViewed from an evolutionary perspective, the deficit model can be understood in one of two ways.\nFirst, the extent of developmental canalisation may have been inherently constrained. All else being\nequal, a developmental process robust to perturbation would seem optimal. However, all else is not\nequal, as such robusticity may be prohibitively expensive (coming, for example, at the expense of\nthe pace of development, total number of offspring, etc.). If the average payoff across individuals of\nrobust development exceeds the cost, canalisation will be incomplete – in essence, selection will favour\na degree of developmental fragility as a price worth paying, the consequence being that adverse early\nexperiences may set the stage for multiple adult pathologies. Alternately, selection may favour developmental\nplasticity rather than canalisation. Insults during development may constitute cues regarding\nthe expected payoffs of enduring investments in maintenance.\nLife history theory seeks to understand key aspects of the adult phenotype in terms of inherent tradeoffs\nbetween growth, reproduction and longevity. Of direct relevance here, various versions of life history\ntheory hold that adverse early experiences can indicate that, given corresponding expected high adult\nmortality, on average fitness will be optimised by devoting resources to rapid maturation and reproduction\nat the expense of longevity (Ellis et al., 2017; Figueredo et al., 2006; Hill & Kaplan, 1999; Simpson\net al., 2012; Wu et al., 2020). Considerable debate surrounds various applications of life history frameworks\nto individual variation among contemporary humans (see Frankenhuis & Nettle, 2020; Stearns\n& Rodrigues, 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Furthermore, observers (see Frankenhuis & Nettle, 2020; Sear,\n2020) have distinguished between the use of the life history framework in the measurement of features\ndirectly associated with the key tradeoffs (such as morphological and physiological attributes; the timing\nof sexual maturation and reproduction; total fertility, etc.) and the use of this framework in the measurement\nof psychosocial features that, conceptualised as part of overall strategies, are more distally related to\nthese tradeoffs (such as personality, sociosexual orientation, future discounting, cooperativeness, etc.).\nCritics (ibid.) argue that, unlike the former corpus, the latter body of work is too far removed from the\ntradeoffs central to life history theory to be informed by such considerations – and at least one study\nhas found that, when psychometric measures are directly pitted against biodemographic indices more\nclosely linked to the key tradeoffs, the former fail to predict the latter (Međedović, 2020).\nWhile acknowledging the limitations of some translations of life history frameworks to the psychological\ndomain, in an attempt to better illuminate the relationship between early experience and PTSD,\nhere we suggest two applications of the life history approach which apply the construct of a life history\nstrategy while conceptually centring the key principle of tradeoffs between growth, reproduction and\nlongevity. Deferring for the moment the details of how we operationalise life history strategy, below we\noutline these two theoretical applications.\nFirst, if a harsh early environment is treated by evolved calibration mechanisms as predictive of\nhigh extrinsic mortality in adulthood, investments in rapid maturation and reproduction may be privileged\nover investments in long-term maintenance and repair, leading to a less resilient adult pheno-\ntype. This provides an ultimate explanation for the patterns posited by the conventional deficit model\nof PTSD etiology. Individuals who experienced adverse early environments will be more vulnerable to\na variety of insults to fitness not because building resilience was inherently precluded by deprivation,\nbut rather because the resources necessary for such resilience were instead committed to rapid growth\nand reproduction. If any potential gains from greater durability would probably be precluded by fatal\nchallenges against which no degree of resilience would suffice, then building resilience yields lower\nexpected payoffs than accelerating reproduction.\nThe deficit model of PTSD is both intuitive and supported by a considerable corpus of epidemiological\nfindings. For example, for US disaster workers who responded in the aftermath of the 9/11 ter-\nrorist attacks, the PTSD incidence was higher among those whose lifestyle characteristics were\nassociated with greater early adversity (Giosan & Wyka, 2009). However, not all available evidence\nsupports this model. Despite the description present in the DSM-5, meta-analyses have shown that\n2 Edward K. Clint and Daniel M. T. Fessler\n', 'racial minority status – which, reflecting the consequences of discrimination, is frequently associated\nwith adverse early experiences – is a weak or absent predictor (Bonanno et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2011).\nMoreover, research into psychological resilience has demonstrated that, under certain circumstances,\nadversity is critical to developing resilience (Luthar, 2006). Within the US military, reserve forces –\nwho, being more educated and enjoying higher socioeconomic status, can be presumed to have suffered\nfewer adverse early experiences – sometimes have similar or higher PTSD rates compared with\nactive-duty troops (Lane et al., 2012; Milliken et al., 2007). Lastly, a recent study of PTSD in 24 nations\nfound that measures of adversity such as malnutrition, income inequality and access to sanitation were\nnegatively, not positively, associated with rates of PTSD, even controlling for exposure to traumatic\nexperiences (Dückers et al., 2016). Such observations suggest that alternative accounts may be required.\nLife history theory can again be a fertile source of possibilities. Emergency responses to imminent\nthreats are costly. The value of extensive responses thus hinges in part on the expected frequency of\ncrises, as frequent high levels of activation throughout adulthood will often not be sustainable. If early\nexperiences provide cues of the expectable adult environment, then, in the service of sustainability,\nadverse early experiences may tamp down adult emergency reactivity. Such a pattern is particularly\nadaptive if many of the most significant sources of adult mortality are truly extrinsic, such that marshalling\nresources to address a source of danger will do little to buffer the individual against the threat.\nRather than being wasted in the fruitless pursuit of longevity, such resources are instead better spent in\nenhancing reproduction. If PTSD constitutes a pathological chronic hyper-activation of emergency\nresponses, then, being less reactive to crises, individuals with a history of adverse early experiences\ncould actually be at lower risk of PTSD – the opposite prediction to that of the deficit model.\nIn this application of life history theory, individuals who experience propitious early environments\nwill deploy extensive resources in the face of fitness insults in order to pursue longevity; ironically,\nhowever, this very reactivity will make them vulnerable to pathologically excessive defensive responses\nthat endure long after a momentous threat has passed.\nEpidemiological data support the association of early adversity with such physiological and behavioural\ncharacteristics as faster development, more offspring, decreased self-investment, higher prefer-\nence for risk-taking, more selfish and less pro-social attitudes, steeper future discounting and\npresent-orientation, and a preference for shorter-term sexual relationships (Belsky et al., 2015;\nBrumbach et al., 2009; Carver et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2011; McDermott et al., 2021). In short, existing\nevidence suggests that there is indeed adaptive calibration of life history trajectory early in life.\nHowever, it remains an open question whether such traits reflect a phenotype in which the individual\nis more vulnerable to, or, conversely, better prepared for, potentially traumatic experiences.\nTo explore the competing possibilities described above, using a large military sample, we examined the\nextent to which early life adversity influences lifestyle and personality characteristics in adulthood that, in\nturn, may correlatewith PTSD risk. Amilitary sample affords relatively high rates of both exposure to traumatic\nevents and PTSD, increasing statistical power for detecting correlated traits. Formuch of the past two\ndecades, the US has been actively involved in armed conflict. Throughout this period, the US military has\nscreened service members for PTSD following deployment. Relative to the general population, USmilitary\npersonnel thus constitute acommunityboth at greater riskofdevelopingPTSDandmore likely tohave been\nevaluated forPTSD.The Study toAssessRisk andResilience in Servicemembers (STARRS) dataset includes\ndetailed records on exposure to potentially traumatic experiences, as well as personal, health and lifestyle\ndata, allowing for a multiplex assessment of life history orientation and its relationship with PTSD.\nSample\nOur data derive from the United States Army STARRS Consolidated All Army Survey (AAS), an epidemiological\nstudy that combined data across three surveys:\n(1) the core AAS, a survey administered from 2011 to 2012 in a probability sample of 17,462 active\nRegular Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve units worldwide, excluding soldiers\ndeployed or in basic training;\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 3\n', '(2) a 2012–2013 AAS expansion that surveyed 3987 deployed soldiers stationed in Afghanistan\nwhile in Kuwait awaiting transit to or from mid-deployment leave; and\n(3) the baseline STARRS Pre-Post Deployment Survey, which surveyed 8558 soldiers in three\nBrigade Combat Teams shortly before deploying to Afghanistan in 2012.\nThe recruitment, informed consent and data collection procedures, described in more detail elsewhere\n(Kessler, Colpe, et al., 2013), were approved by the Human Subjects Committees of the\nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (Bethesda, MD, USA) for the Henry\nM. Jackson Foundation (the primary grantee), the Institute for Social Research at the University of\nMichigan (Ann Arbor, MI, USA, the organisation collecting the data), Harvard Medical School\n(Boston, MA, USA), and the University of California, San Diego (La Jolla, CA, USA). All study participants\ngave written informed consent.\nInformation on handling bias, including sample weighting, response rate and sample exclusions, is\nreported elsewhere (Kessler, Heeringa, et al., 2013). We focus on the 21,449 respondents who completed\na survey. We excluded respondents who did not consent to link their administrative records\nto their survey for analyses that include service component as a covariate. In total, 17,462 soldiers\nwho completed the survey consented to administrative data linkage. One-hundred and eighty respondents\nwere omitted because the survey data did not include PTSD symptom and/or age data; 1443\nwere excluded owing to their reporting subadult-onset PTSD. A further 3,730 respondents’ data did\nnot include one or more set of survey items on which we conducted our life history orientation principal\ncomponents analysis. This left a sample of n = 16,096; see Supplemental Table S1 for sample\ncharacteristics.\nMethods\nVariables extracted from STARRS\nPTSD\nA majority of participants answered nine PTSD checklist (PCL)-based survey questions about PTSD\nsymptoms (Bliese et al., 2008). Some 4,102 of those did not record age of onset, so a second survey\nitem and its associated age of onset was used where present (Weissman et al., 2000).\nExposure level\nParticipants responded to 14 questions about potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) during deployment\n(e.g. combat patrol duty, assault, firing rounds at the enemy or taking fire, being wounded in\ncombat). Each question asked about the number of times each PTE occurred during any previous\ndeployment.\nEarly adversity measures\nParent’s education: maximum education level of either parent was used as a proxy for childhood socioeconomic\nstatus (SES). The dataset values ranged from 1 (no education) to 8 (post-graduate; see\nSupplemental Table S1).\nEarly head injuries: childhood head injury sufficient to cause loss of consciousness, eardrum perforation,\nmemory loss or dazing comprised the second measure of early adversity. These four possible\nhead injury conditions suffered in childhood were added together to form a composite with a range of\n0–4. The multiple durations of ‘loss of consciousness’ were collapsed into a binary value for the loss of\nconsciousness injury condition prior to compositing with the other early age head injury conditions.\nLife history construct\nFrom the wide array of survey items employed in the STARRS, we identified those relevant to psychological\ntraits hypothesised to be associated with differing life history orientations, including self-\ninvestment, relationship quality, prosociality and reproduction (Brumbach et al., 2009; Figueredo\net al., 2006). Multiple survey items were composited for each of the eight categories: relationship\n4 Edward K. Clint and Daniel M. T. Fessler\n', 'quality, education, health, tobacco addiction, substance use and abuse, antisocial attitudes, criminal\ninvolvement and number of children. When items within the same category used different scales,\nitems were normalised by dividing the value by the maximum item value within each category.\nTo facilitate interpretation of results, where necessary, scales were inverted such that a higher numerical\nvalue was consistent with the predicted trait associated with early adversity (see Supplementary\nMaterials, life history category construction). A principal component analysis was performed on\nthe eight category composites. The first principal component (PC1) accounted for a 23.8% plurality\nof the variance (see Figure 1). Every category composite loaded positively and, other than the number\nof children item, quite substantially on PC1, therefore PC1 was selected as the life history orientation\nconstruct for subsequent analyses.\nCovariates\nAge, race, sex, service component, location of the interview\nAge was a continuous variable. Sex was a binary variable. Race was coded in three ways, white or not\nwhite, Black or not Black, or as a categorical variable with eight levels (white, Black, Native American,\nAsian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, bi-racial, or other). These were exclusive categories, i.e. individuals\nwere placed in one and only one category. Multi-racial refers to individuals who checked yes to at\nleast two of the categories. Service component was a categorical binary of active duty or not, in which ‘not’\nmeant a member of the National Guard or Reserve who had been activated and deployed. Location of the\ninterview was coded as a categorical variable with three levels: USA, overseas base and overseas theatre.\nSubjective coping resources\nSubjective coping resources act as buffers against stress and adversity. These can include the degree of\ndirect and indirect social support, as well as pre-trauma well-adjustedness. For deployed soldiers, their\nprofessional setting is also their de facto community and base of social support for months or longer.\nTherefore, their view of the degree of acceptance, respect, support, competence, fairness and professionalism\nshould be an important factor aiding them in coping with PTEs. The 14 items chosen\nfor this composite included the participant’s rated morale, whether they feel discriminated against,\nthe degree to which they can rely on peers and superiors for help, how well leaders treat soldiers,\nand whether they respect the unit leadership (for a complete list, see Supplemental Table 2).\nCoding of eight of the variables was inverted so that higher values consistently indicated greater subjective\ncoping resources across all items. The items were normalised and averaged together to produce\nthe coping resources composite variable.\nFigure 1. Principal component analysis of the lifestyle latent variables. (a) Proportion of variance explained by each of the eight\nprincipal components. (b) Loadings of PC1 and PC2 on the eight variables. For information on how the variables were constructed\nfrom the Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS) dataset, see Methods and Supplementary Materials.\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 5\n', 'Resilience to stress\nParticipants responded to five items by indicating their ability to keep calm in a crisis, manage stress,\ntry new approaches when old ways do not work, get along with people when ‘you have to’ and keep a\nsense of humor in tense situations. The encoding was inverted so that higher values indicated\nincreased self-reported resilience. They were summed to produce the resilience composite variable.\nStatistical analysis\nData were analysed using RStudio version 1.4.1106. Principal component analysis was used to extract\nthe main axis of variation (PC1) from the eight compiled measures of life history orientation described\nabove. The probability of PTSD diagnosis was analysed as a linear function of multiple continuous and\ncategorical predictor variables using logistic regression implemented using the ‘glm’ function and\nentering family as ‘binomial’. Fisher’s exact test was used for pair-wise comparisons of the probability\nof PTSD diagnosis between two groups without correcting for any covariates (e.g. two sexes, two\nraces). Mediation analysis was conducted using the mediation library in R. Two separate mediation\nanalyses were conducted for each of the early adversity measures: number of head injuries and parent’s\neducation level. Specifically, the extent to which each of the early adversity measures influenced PTSD\nprobability via its influence on the life history construct (PC1 from the principal component analysis;\nsee above) was evaluated. Correlations between two continuous variables were evaluated using\nPearson’s correlation coefficient.\nResults\nEarly adversity increases PTSD risk\nAnalysis of PTSD risk as a function of early head injuries showed a positive correlation by logistic\nregression (no covariates, slope = 0.3; p < 0.0001). Parent’s education was significantly negatively correlated\nwith PTSD risk (no covariates, slope =−0.035, p = 0.01). The two measures of early adversity\nwere weakly positively correlated with each other (Pearson’s r = 0.073; p < 0.0001).\nLife history metric\nThe first principal component (PC1) extracted from 44 variables (see Supplemental Table S2)\nexplained 23.8% of the variation in the data (Figure 1a). Each of the variables was positively loaded\non PC1, indicating that all the variables contributed to PC1 in the expected direction, with the weights\nshown in Figure 1.\nLife history strongly predicts PTSD risk\nIn a logistic regression analysis predicting PTSD risk as a function of exposure, number of head injuries\nin childhood, parent’s education, survey location, service component (active duty vs. guard/\nreserve), sex, coping, resilience, age, race and PC1, all of the variables were significant (Figure 2)\n(type III sums of squares) except parent’s education (Table 1). Race was marginally insignificant\n( p = 0.057). We analysed race both as a categorical variable with eight levels (see above) and on the\npresumption that, although many people of colour suffer discrimination in the US, on average,\nBlack individuals plausibly suffer the greatest disadvantage, as a binary variable (entered as Black\nor not Black). In all cases, race remained not significant (all p > 0.05).\nRace is not a significant predictor of PTSD risk even without correcting for covariates\nWe also analysed PTSD risk as a function of only race (Black or not Black) absent other factors.\nThe result was marginally not significant with a trend towards reduced PTSD risk for Black soldiers\n( p = 0.09381). When all races were entered as a categorical variable (1–8), race was also marginally\nnot significant ( p = 0.05).\n6 Edward K. Clint and Daniel M. T. Fessler\n', 'Sex is a highly significant predictor of PTSD risk\nWithout correcting for any covariates, women displayed a 1.27-fold increased risk compared with\nmen. This difference was larger (1.71-fold) after correcting for all covariates (Supplemental\nFigure S1b).\nNumber of traumatic experiences is also a strong predictor of PTSD risk\nFigure 3 shows the probability of suffering PTSD as a function of the number of traumatic experiences\n(first quartile, mean, third quartile), separately for individuals with a low vs. high score for PC1 (first\nand third quartiles for PC1), illustrating the large effect that life history orientation has on risk independent\nof the number of traumas experienced.\nGuard and reserve soldiers had a marginally lower value for life history orientation, and lower\nPTSD risk\nActive duty status was associated with increased PTSD risk after controlling for all covariates\n(s = 0.1852, p < 0.001, n = 1).\nMediation analysis\nThe results reveal that both early adversity measures affected PTSD risk via life history characteristics.\nThe number of early head injuries had a significant direct effect and a significant mediation effect\n(Table 2). Approximately 25% of the total effect was mediated via life history factors. Parent’s education\ndid not have a significant direct effect, but there was a significant mediation effect (Table 2).\nApproximately 84% of the total effect was mediated by life history factors.\nDiscussion\nThe hypothesis that a life history orientation associated with early adversity could buffer against PTSD\nrisk was not supported in our results. On the contrary, a life history orientation characterised by\ngreater risk-taking and anti-social behaviour, and fewer long-term investments was a potent positive\npredictor of PTSD risk. At the lower end of the life history orientation distribution (associated with a\nnurturing early environment), PTSD risk was about 15%; at the higher end (associated with a harsh\nFigure 2.

This relationship held even controlling for\nexposure, early adversity, sex, age, race, resilience and subjective coping resources. In our analytical\nmodel, a soldier at the low end of the life history construct (PC1 first quartile) would require more\nthan double the number of exposures to potentially traumatic events to equal the PTSD risk for\nthe high end (PC1 third quartile) given mean exposure. Few epidemiological PTSD studies have controlled\nfor both the frequency and degree of exposure to potentially traumatic experiences and pre-\nexisting childhood trauma.\nEvolutionary perspectives on PTSD\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to hypothesise that a fast life history orientation might buffer PTSD\nrisk. Our analysis does not support this hypothesis. Instead, it supports the prevailing deficit model, an\naccount congruent with either constrained developmental canalisation or the dominant view among\npsychological life history theorists, namely that health, including mental health, is traded off against\nother demands among ‘faster’ individuals (Del Giudice, 2014; Giosan & Wyka, 2009): the fast life history\ndevelopmental syndrome sacrifices elements of phenotypic robustness in order to prioritise faster\ndevelopment and earlier reproduction, similar to the way that immune system competence and somatic\nmaintenance are diminished. This appears to extend to the mind as well, with fewer resources\nFigure 3. Estimated probability of PTSD (± SE) as a\nfunction of lifestyle orientation (PC1) and PC1 frequency\nhistogram.

While this application of life history theory can be seen as complementing the standard deficit\nmodel, providing an account of ultimate causation that interdigitates with the latter’s proximate\nexplanation, by virtue of their complementarity, it is difficult to determine whether one, the other\nor a combination of these accounts is correct. Nevertheless, some evidentiary space may exist between\nthe stand-alone conventional deficit model and a version thereof that is informed by life history theory.\nSpecifically, in addition to making sensical the relationships between early experience, adult life-\nstyle factors and PTSD risk, it is possible that the addition of life history highlights some aspects of\ndevelopmental experience that underspecified notions of ‘abuse and neglect’might otherwise overlook.\nFor example, investigators have only recently begun exploring the covariation between (conventionally\ndefined) adverse childhood experiences and childhood food insecurity (e.g. Baiden et al., 2021).\nHowever, whereas a deficit approach explains the detrimental developmental effects of the latter in\nterms of nutritional inadequacy, a life history perspective dictates that, even if nutritional needs are\nmet, the experience of food insecurity may constitute a developmental cue that, being predictive of\nan adverse adult environment, results in a faster life history strategy (Nettle, 2017), including both\nassociated lifestyle factors and reduced investment in maintenance, with corresponding increased vulnerability\nto disorders such as PTSD.\nLastly, adjudicating among the potential explanations for results such as ours is further complexified\nby the possibility that patterns evident among contemporary soldiers in a highly developed nation\nmay reflect evolutionary disequilibrium. The virtues associated with a nurturing environment, e.g.\nprosociality, conscientiousness and self-investment in education and skill, are all highly rewarded in\nthe US. Conversely, potential virtues theorised to result from a harsher environment, e.g. aggression,\nrisk-taking and short-term mating preferences, are today punished by law or social censure. In addition,\nearly adversity increases the risk of poverty (Frederick & Goddard, 2007), and in the US, poverty\nexacerbates and magnifies many hindrances to flourishing that compromise coping resources, such as\na lack of access to healthcare, the inability to legally defend oneself from undue insults of the state,\npoor access to quality education, poorer nutrition and food insecurity.\nEarly adversity\nWorking within the constraints of the STARRS dataset, our lack of rich data on early adversity is a\nsignificant limitation of the current study. The direct association between head injuries during\nchildhood and PTSD risk could be mediated by traumatic brain injuries, as such injuries have\nbeen associated with PTSD risk in previous studies (Hoge et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2015;\nSchneiderman et al., 2008; Yurgil et al., 2014). The mediated effect suggests that physical damage\nto the brain also interacts with resulting life history orientation that, in turn, increases PTSD risk.\nThe SES proxy of parent’s education was a weak but significant positive predictor of the life history orientation\ncomposite variable (without covariates) and PTSD (without covariates, see Figure S1 C), conson-\nant with predictions and previous studies (Bonanno et al., 2007; Breslau et al., 1998; Brewin et al., 2000;\nKoenen et al., 2007). The mediation analysis suggests that the influence of parent’s education on PTSD\nrisk was nearly entirely indirect, through its influence on the life history latent variable. More early adversity\nmeasures that do not involve head trauma, such as other SES measures, witnessing violence, losing\nfamily members, food insecurity and harsh and inconsistent parenting, are needed to strengthen the evidence\nfor a positive association between early adversity and the life history construct.\nRace\nWe found a small, marginally non-significant effect of race, such that being Black, arguably the most\ndisadvantaged racial identity in the US, trended towards offering protection from PTSD. The\n10 Edward K. Clint and Daniel M. T. Fessler\n', 'deleterious effects of discrimination and racism on mental health have long been a focus in psychopathology\nresearch, particularly for Black and Latinx individuals in the US. These effects are impli-\ncated in elevated rates or severity of depression, anxiety and substance use disorders among some\nracial minorities. The deficit model predicts substantially increased PTSD rates for persecuted minority\ngroups, particularly when exposure to potentially traumatic experiences is higher. Although ele-\nvated risk for PTSD among minorities has been reported (Breslau et al., 1998), controlling for\nappropriate factors such as SES, life stress and degree of exposure tends to eliminate effects of race\n(Brewin et al., 2000; Bonanno et al., 2007; but contra Roberts et al., 2011). Accordingly, we conclude\nthat direct measures of adversity and lifestyle are likely to be more informative than race as regards\nPTSD risk.\nAge\nPrevious studies generally find PTSD risk to be somewhat higher among younger adults (Bonanno\net al., 2007; Brewin et al., 2000). However, results from military samples have been mixed in this regard\n(Xue et al., 2015). We found a small (slope = 0.035, p < 0.0001) positive association between age (older)\nand PTSD risk when controlling for covariates. Holding aside geopolitical vagaries that increase or\ndecrease US military engagement, among career soldiers, age can be expected to correspond to\ntotal exposure to PTEs, hence a positive correlation with PTSD is in keeping with the\nimpaired-resilience account.\nSex\nConsonant with numerous other studies, women exhibited higher risk of PTSD (Supplemental\nFigure S2g). The disparity increased when covariates were controlled for, increasing from 1.27\ntimes to 1.71 times the risk for PTSD among men. Consonant with the notion that, in an effectively\npolygynous species such as ours, females are characterised by a slower life history orientation than\nmales (Kruger & Nesse, 2006; Tarka et al., 2018), the mean PC1 value was lower among women\n(−0.1274) than among men (0.1234). Nevertheless, the benefits of lower values on our life history\norientation factor were not enough to offset other factors that magnify PTSD risk among women.\nIn non-military samples, across cultures, women evince greater anxiety, neuroticism and pain sensitivity\nthan men, and lower sensation seeking, attributes which are consistent with a more cautious,\nharm-avoidant strategy consonant with lower sex-specific variance in fitness (Benenson et al., 2021;\nSparks et al., 2018). These personality correlates themselves constitute risk factors for PTSD\n(Calegaro et al., 2019; Jakšić et al., 2012). Hence, although a slower life history orientation appears\nto generally buffer against PTSD, the sex difference in PTSD risk may ironically be due to ‘slow’ personality\nfeatures which are more common among women. We acknowledge, however, that it is an\nopen question whether results such as ours are explicable in this manner, as highly anxious,\nharm-avoidant individuals are unlikely to volunteer for military service, and unlikely to be accepted\nor retained if they do. Lastly, women suffer sexual assault in the military at far higher rates than\nmen, and this crime is probably significantly underreported (Wilson, 2018), hence the sex difference\nin PTSD risk may partially reflect patterned differences in exposure to unreported potentially traumatic\nexperiences.\nLimitations\nAs some of the above points suggest, a military sample is not representative of the US civilian population.\nIt is demographically distinct, being mostly male and having many more younger vs. older\nadults, with service being restricted to those who meet many qualifications of health and legal goodstanding.\nLikewise, viewed cross-culturally, both the norms within the US military and the beliefs of\nthe larger US society are not representative of the diverse meaning systems within which individuals\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 11\n', 'may situate traumatic experiences, with corresponding implications for some facets of PTSD\n(Zefferman & Mathew, 2021).\nImportantly, as noted above, our measures of early adversity are quite limited, with only a proxy for\nSES (parent’s education) and a few items comprising the head injury measure. Consonant with the\nlogic of the deficit model, head injury is associated with PTSD independent of other factors, potentially\nconfounding our use of this variable. For these reasons, the connection we draw between\nearly adversity measures and the life history orientation latent construct is tenuous, although other\nstudies have provided evidence of such a link (Brumbach et al., 2009).\nConclusion\nMillions of Americans suffer debilitating effects of PTSD, some for many years. Effective pharmaceutical\nand therapeutic solutions have remained elusive. Prevention is therefore all the more important. In\nturn, efforts to prevent PTSD hinge on understanding underlying risk factors. Early life adversity as a\npredisposing risk factor is both intuitive and empirically supported, and appears to act in part through\nfeatures of adult lifestyle characteristic of a fast life history trajectory. With the caveat that our measures\nare subject to substantial limitations, our findings bolster the prevailing view of developmental\nadversity as erosive to psychological capacities to cope with trauma. Institutions, such as modern\narmed forces, in which exposure to potentially traumatic events is likely to occur, may therefore better\nserve both their members and society at large by assessing such risk factors during selection and training,\nand directing enhanced resources to members at greater risk.\nAcknowledgements.
