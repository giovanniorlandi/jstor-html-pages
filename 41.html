        <pre>['Chapter 5 Epigraphic strategies of communication: the visual accusative of Roman Republican dedications of spoils Fabio Luci Introduction When we look at an inscription combined with an artwork or monument, attention is usually paid to what information is provided by its text. In many cases, the inscription is considered as a “caption” for its related visual object. Considering inscriptions as “captions” can be useful for answering important, but general questions, for example, the identity of the honoured person and/or the dedicator(s) represented on a statue, the historical circumstances of such an honour or whatever other issues are addressed by the information included in the inscription. The major risk in considering inscriptions as captions is to regard the role of the inscription as subordinate to the whole composition, which drastically limits its potential. More recent works on art and text demonstrated that there is an increasing focus on cross-disciplinary analysis in the visual and textual culture of the ancient world.1 John Ma’s Statues and Cities provides an important contribution towards understanding not only how art and text interacted with their space and audience, but also the physical interplay between art and text themselves, warning about the risk in considering inscriptions as only captions of their visual objects. It is worth strongly emphasizing this last point: that 1 In art history, the first word encountered when dealing with image and text is ekphrasis, literally “writing on art”. The approach developed in this field (already known by ancient authors such as Pliny, Vitruvius, Lucian, Philostratus, and Pausanias) offers today important studies on the intertextuality between art and text (Robillard and Jongeneel 1998; Webb 1999; Elsner 2002; 2007; 2010; Goldhill 2007; Squire 2015; Roby 2016). In another subfield of scholarship, inscriptions are at the centre of multidisciplinary analysis that focuses on the physicality of the inscriptions and their relationship with the space and the ancient viewers: Cooley 2008; Ma 2013; Sears et al. 2013; Petrovic et al. 2018. In these works, as in my own, inscriptions are also integral parts of their monuments, and they work to reshape their physical features as well as their political meanings.', '96 Fabio Luci an inscription is not only the caption for a composition. Rather it is a concrete and stand-alone object that is correlated with its artwork.2 This paper offers a different approach to monuments and inscriptions, focusing on compositions as a set produced by a single matrix. Inscriptions attached to monuments were more than simple carved words informing the reader about the object itself, the dedicator(s) or the recipient(s). Rather, in many cases, inscriptions had a central role in determining the way their readers approached them and the dedications themselves. It is worth restating the obvious: monuments, inscriptions, artworks, visual objects, complexes, dedications, etc. had remarkable communicative resonance with their audience; inasmuch as the audience could interact with them and understand their significance. It does not surprise that the relationship between the visual object and the text was strategic and important in shaping the monument’s overall meaning. The way inscriptions and artworks interacted to create such a consistent and effective message to their audience was through the construction of a syntax, capable of transforming the visual objects into almost textual elements of their inscriptions. The audience was the catalyst to trigger the transformation by actively interacting with the compositions. A series of inscriptions from the Roman Republic dedicated by Roman commanders to tell their audience about their victorious military campaigns and their political successes offers a perfect example for the proposed methodological framework. In this kind of inscription, the direct object is always textually omitted, yet it was present in a visual form. This strategy creates a tension for those who read the apparently incomplete sentence, leaving to the audience the task of completing its meaning by looking at the artwork as the (visual) accusative of the inscription. The benchmark case used in this work is the inscription of Claudius Marcellus in Rome in 211 BC (CIL I2 608), focusing on its syntax to show how the statue itself is a surrogate for the missing direct object of the inscription. Metaphorically speaking, the visual object became part of the syntax of the inscription, whose accusative was intentionally not expressed by words. This analysis has two aims: the first is to set a new, and broadly adaptable, methodological approach in understanding the way epigraphy and artworks were strategically used by dedicators to communicate with their audience. Through the syntax of the inscription, each element of the phrase – subject, verb, and then the direct object, metaphorically embodied by the visual artwork – are perfectly organized and dependent on each other. The strategy adopted by dedicators pushed the audience in integrating the visual object into the incomplete syntax of the epigraphy; by doing so they restored the message promoted by the whole composition. The second is to show how this methodology, in some measure, is capable of analyzing monuments by only looking at their inscriptions when the artworks are now lost. In this sense, text and visual object are part of the same syntax, and the inscriptions can be 2 Ma 2013, 15– 24.', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 97 considered as part of the missing visual artwork’s body, just as a torso or a head are to a fragmentary statue. Words and images: a syntactical framework Inscriptions and monuments are produced from the same matrix: by those historical contingencies (events, actions, and consequences) that were considered worthy of being remembered and celebrated. In this light, inscriptions and monuments are equally vehicles of information, but they diverge concerning how they deliver the message to their audience: the first in linguistic form, the latter in visual form. In a single composition, for example, if we consider a statue placed over an inscribed base, both its artistic features and textual languages communicate a particular message to the audience. The main characteristic of this double channel of communication is how images and texts work together to convey clear messages to their audience. These two different vehicles of information contained a built-in multiplicity of meaning, such as civic and military values of the Roman Republic both in visual and textual form. What was crucial for the patrons of honorary dedications was to deliver clear messages that could benefit both from the strength of visuality and the conciseness of the text. This attitude is not too hard to imagine if we think about the importance of honorary practice in Republican Rome, where the competition among families and individual was played through the display of power, prestige, values, and ideals. Words and images function in different ways because of their contrasting textual and visual natures. Whereas words need to be read, images are appreciated for their visual features: theme, iconography, and style. Understanding the content of an inscription required the ability to read simple Latin.3 In addition, visual features could not speak by themselves unless the audience were familiar with local and foreign artistic traditions and capable of distinguishing the differences between one and the other. Connoisseurship in art was more easily accessible to the elite class. However, it is absurd to think that the consumption of compositions of artworks and inscriptions was restricted to the elites, not only considering the location chosen for honorary dedications, such as in the Forum, but also because they addressed a heterogeneous public, including a solid base of clients and supporters, to increase the prestige of the honoured individuals and their families. Inscriptions had a pivotal role in forming the message of the whole composition. Their words guided the audience in discerning the meaning, not only of the event that was being celebrated by the honorific dedication, but also in understanding the connection between the visual object – its content, style, and iconography – and the words expressed in its inscription. Through the repetition of formulaic epigraphic 3 In some cases, it was not even necessary to have a high level of literacy because the honorary inscriptions of the Republic were quite concise and tended to resort to well-known words (e.g., names with filiation, titles, offices) framed in formulaic sentences (Corbier 2013, 13–38; Revell 2013, 231–3). On the nature of inscriptions, see the thought-provoking essay by Panciera 2012.', '98 Fabio Luci sentences, the audience became accustomed to an epigraphic landscape that helped them to immediately grasp what the composition was about. The combination of political, social, and military ideal values (such as auctoritas, clementia, concordia, pietas, maiestas, virtus) was traditionally understood in the Roman culture via individual cases as exempla. One of the channels through which these ideal values were communicated was figurative art, by associating ideal values to the various stylistic forms drawn from Greek artistic tradition. The abstraction of ideal values became a link between subjects represented and forms of imagery, creating a versatile and adaptive system for Roman art. As Hölscher has pointed out, this “ideological system”, formed during the Republic and consistently applied during the following centuries, was used to exemplify intellectual ideals more than to record historical reality.4 Although this system is now well accepted, it is less clear how the process of abstraction worked and how the artistic forms were understood by the audience. Inscriptions can be much more helpful in understanding the conceptualization of artistic forms. Artistic styles and iconography could be understood as connected to particular ideal values, as argued by Hölscher and Zanker.5 However, each individual artwork was also the result of a historical event that generated, in the first place, the visual and textual compositions. In this respect, inscriptions informed the audience about which event was commemorated and why. This information contained abstract concepts: for example, an inscription can inform its viewers about the capture of a city, but it is not limited to the factual event. Inscriptions contain far more information, or they can imply something, such as the narrative of a successful military action performed by a commander and, thus, the ideal values connected to it: the virtus of the commander who achieved it, but also the euergetism of the commander who dedicated a beautiful artwork to the city or his pietas in dedicating it as a votive offering. Thus, inscriptions pointed more directly at specific ideal values from the Roman value system. By juxtaposing inscriptions with artworks, any ideal values connected with the inscriptions (from the previous example, virtus, euergetism, or pietas), were also attached also to the artistic style of the visual object. Only subsequently could artistic forms, whose meaning was translated and understood with the support of the language in the form of inscribed letters, be conceptualized into ideals and values. In other words, the ideal values produced by the significance of the event remembered by the words of an inscription were transferred to the style of the artwork. The major questions that stem from this set of assumptions are, first, how inscriptions helped viewers understand what the images represented and, second, how two different communicative systems could be integrated into a single narrative. The answers can only be found by looking at the interaction between language and image and at the processes that establish such an interaction. It is useful to borrow the notion of syntax 4 Hölscher 2004, 88–9. 5 Hölscher 2004; Zanker 1988.', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 99 from linguistics exclusively for the purposes of this discussion and apply it as an effective solution for analyzing the interactions between language and image. In linguistics, “syntax” means a set of rules and tenets of a language that organize and arrange words, phrases, and clauses to fully form logical sentences. From this generic definition of syntax, it is possible to narrow down, for the benefit of this discussion, the grammatical function of the syntax to the way in which a specific word or element of a sentence can be arranged and defined in its function with other words or elements of the same sentence.6 In Latin, unlike in English, in order to accomplish the formation of sentences and their subsequent meanings, words, in our cases the words of an inscription, adopt specific grammatical cases that define what function they play within the sentence. The role of each word in a sentence is defined by its grammatical function, and the correlation between the words is determined by a specific syntax. The syntax, in organizing the words, creates logical and clear phrases. Roman dedicatory inscriptions are expressed through sentences that can also be analysed in terms of “grammar” and “syntax”. Each word of an inscription is related to the others to form a complete sentence. As is demonstrated in this section, not all the syntax contained in all the inscriptions of Roman dedications has been completed and, as a result, needs to find its connections and relationships “outside” of the text. Although Roman dedicatory inscriptions are expressed by words alone, their meanings only became complete and intelligible to their readers with the integration of non-textual elements related to the inscriptions, namely, the artwork itself and, in some circumstances, the space in which it was placed. In this study, the grammar and syntax of Roman dedicatory inscriptions play a central role not only in revealing the grammatical function of the words of the inscription, but also in distinguishing and emphasizing the correlation between the textual and non-textual elements and their respective and metaphorical roles. The verbal syntax of the inscriptions is integrated with the non-textual elements, such as the monument itself and the space in which it has been placed. In this way, the syntax is not only able to complete the meaning of the whole composition by considering all its elements at once, but it also cooperates in translating the artistic form into intellectual ideals. The final result is the presentation of a single consistent and intelligible narrative of the whole composition to its audience. 6 The defining contribution to linguistic semiotics was made by Ferdinand de Saussure’s Course in General Linguistics, published in 1916. In Saussure’s formulation, language is a system of signs, each sign consisting of the actual form the sign takes, that is, a signifier, and the concept it represents, that is, a signified. The relationship between the signifier and signified is conventional, which means that it is dependent on the social context and its particular cultural conventions.', '100 Fabio Luci Inscriptions of Roman Republican dedications of spoils The pattern of Roman Republican dedicatory inscriptions is quite simple. These inscriptions usually contain a subject (rendered in the nominative case), the typical filiation that grammatically corresponds to the apposition of the subject, a transitive verb of the sentence and an ablative of separation that indicates the location from where the item was taken (Leucadus, Enna, or another city). It is evident that in such a sentence there is something missing. Although the subject of the action, the action, and the location are there, there is no trace of the direct object, which, however, must be present due to the transitive verb. In many cases, the recipient of the dedications is also absent, although it is not compulsory for the sentence consistency. The missing elements must be searched for in non-textual elements and the artwork itself becomes the direct object of the sentence because it is related to the action expressed by the sentence verb (i.e., capere or dare). In this sense, the artwork assumes the syntactic role as the “visual accusative”; the physical space in which the artwork was placed might define a metaphorical dative of interest. The deliberate omission of words by the dedicators has the effect of creating a “tension” for those who read an apparently incomplete sentence, leaving to the audience the task of completing the meaning. In completing the message, the audience are pushed to look at non-textual elements as part of the inscription’s syntax in order to close the textual gap. Hence, the participation of the audience is fundamental and complementary to the metaphorical creation of a syntax that considers both textual and non-textual elements. A dedicatory inscription carved on the base of a statue by Lucius Quinctius Flamininus at Praeneste in 192 BC offers a specific example of how non-textual elements are metaphorically part of the syntax (Fig. 5.1): [L. Quinctius L(uci) f(ilius) Le]ucado cepit / [eidem conso]l dedit.7 Lucius Quinctius, son of Lucius, took from Leucadus, he gave as consul. The first observation is that this category of inscriptions is commonly translated with the inclusion of the direct object in the form of “this”, despite its absence from the text. For example, this inscription is usually translated in manuals and books as: “Lucius Quinctius, son of Lucius took this as booty from Leucas; he likewise made a gift of it when he was consul”;8 or “L. Quinctius, son of Lucius, took this from Leucadus. He gave it as consul”.9 The word “this” is absent from the Latin text and should not be translated whatsoever. Including the word “this” in the translation could, apparently, be correct to reconstruct the meaning of the sentence. However, 7 CIL I2 613. 8 Warmington 1940, 77. 9 Riggsby 2006, 218.', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 101 Fig. 5.1: Dedication by L. Quinctius Flamininus in Praeneste (Center for Epigraphical and Palaeographical Studies, Ohio State University). its inclusion downplays and undermines the significance of the artwork and its relationship with the inscription.10 Although the inclusion of “this” in translations is common practice and can be useful to provide a full understanding of the inscription’s texts, it nevertheless affects the meaning of the whole composition because it deprives the real object, the artwork, of its syntactic function. It is important, therefore, to approach the translation of the text of the inscription exclusively from what is actually present in order to understand the interconnection between object and text.11 Accordingly, my translation is: Lucius Quinctius, son of Lucius, took from Leucadus, he gave as consul. The second observation is that the missing elements that complete the meaning of the sentence and of the whole composition, are the accusative dependent on cepit (to take) and the dative of interest implied by dedit (to give). The accusative can be integrated with the artwork itself, which assumes the role of a “visual accusative”, acting as a surrogate for the textual accusative. Conversely, the textual absence of the dative can be reintegrated by the physical space in which the composition was placed, which points to its destinatory: for example, to the people of a city, if it was set in a public space, to a god, if it was set in a temple. In this syntactic system, both space and audience can assume the role of metaphorical datives. As datives, space and audience not only contribute to completing the meaning of the sentence, but they also strengthen the effectiveness of the dedication message. In this specific 10 In fact, in La Trahison des images by Magritte, determining the relationship between the image and the demonstrative pronoun, “ceci”, can be particularly controversial. The Roman dedicator did not want such ambiguity. 11 The translations of all inscriptions are mine. In my translations the nominative might present the cognomen of the subject, for example, (Marcellus), (Nobilior) etc., to clarify for the reader who the individuals mentioned are.', '102 Fabio Luci case, the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia provides the identification of the indirect object of the composition – the goddess – although this is absent from the text of the inscription. The citizens of Praeneste are the audience looking at this dedication, and they take up the role of the dative of advantage because they indirectly benefit from the consumption of the artwork. The two metaphorical datives represented by space and audience, respectively, do not necessarily overlap. They assume two different functions: whereas the indirect object directly exalts the relationship of the Quinctii with Fortuna Primigenia,12 the dative of advantage shows the sphere of influence of the Quinctii in Praeneste.13 The significance of this model in reconstructing the connections between art and text based on a syntactic structure is not a mere intellectual exercise. Its applicability to the honorific dedications has several implications for our understanding of Roman culture and its artistic production. In the first instance, this model can be very helpful in highlighting the complexity and the novelty of the artistic and epigraphic output that the Roman political culture produced. Second, it negates the idea that republican artworks are completely lost, as scholarship tends to suggest. Inscriptions and artworks were conceived as a whole by their patrons and consumed as a whole by their viewers. This means that inscriptions should not be considered as any different from fragments that remain of a statue or monument. By considering inscriptions as fragments of otherwise lost artworks, it is possible to collect more information about the style and the iconography of a monument, no less than an arm, a torso, or a capital can provide. This syntactic model exploits the mechanics of how the text of an inscription has a syntactic link with its artwork. In most of the inscriptions related to spoils there are no textual accusatives to complete the significance of the verbs in the sentences, as shown in Table 5.1. The apparently missing direct object exists, but in a visual form. This intentional omission would avoid the redundancy of repeating the direct object textually, because it is present visually. The missing direct object pushes the audience to participate in order to complete the meaning of the sentence with the inclusion of the visual object as a figurative direct object of the sentence. The model presented can offer significant insight into the reception of the artworks and inscriptions. The interplay between text and artwork can help us understand how the audience understood and interacted with the honorific practice. When they approached a monument, a complex, or any brand new or refurbished building, they searched for the inscriptions. Once found, the viewers could fully appreciate and understand the significance of the whole composition. This is suggested not only by 12 The relationship between the Quincti and Fortuna is attested also from a dedication carved on an altar: Fortuna[(e) - - - ] / sac[(rum) - - - ] / T. Quincti[ - - - de] / Senati sente[ntiae - - - ] (CIL I2 656). 13 Clientships and political connections between the Quinctii and the citizens of Praeneste began in 380 BC and were started by Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus Capitolinus. See Demma 2011 for a broader discussion of the Quinctii, esp. 40–1.', '5.

The result of including the visual elements of the artwork in the verbal syntax of the inscriptions was to reinforce the reception of their combined message by its audience. The visual accusative as a syntactic strategy: the case of Marcellus The inscription CIL I2 608 relating to Claudius Marcellus (end of the third century BC) offers an ideal test-case in which textual and non-textual elements can be analyzed in the proposed syntactic structure: namely, how the visual object becomes part of its syntax. The test-case shows the potential that my syntactic model can offer for analyzing epigraphic dedicatory examples, including a second coeval inscription relating to Marcellus (CIL I2 609). Indeed, these two texts offer the chance to observe the dynamism of the self-promotion strategies used by patrons in their dedications. 14 E.g., the inscriptions of Anicius at Praeneste (Livy 23.19.17–18); or the absence of Metellus Macedonicus’ inscription on the two temples of his portico (Velleius Paterculus 1.11.4).', '104 Fabio Luci The inscriptions of Marcellus are not an isolated case, but fit into a customary pattern used by many other victorious commanders from the third and second centuries BC. The interplay between text and art was, therefore, a generally accepted system, used by patrons, and understood and consumed by viewers. The contact point between art and text is established by the role that the artwork acquires if considered within the inscription. By integrating the missing direct object of the inscription with its related artwork, the sentence’s syntax is completed by the “visual accusative”, which completes the message of the composition. The integration of the artwork with the inscription’s syntax, however, is triggered only by the participation of the audience in reading, looking at, and consuming the whole composition. Without the active participation of an audience familiar with the Latin language, eliciting the meaning conveyed by the artwork and inscriptions of these dedications would not be possible. The contemporary audience were surely accustomed to this process, and their participation was mandatory, as will be discussed later on. For us, the process may not be prompted naturally. In order to rebuild the original meaning of the composition it is necessary to approach the artworks and their inscriptions in the same fashion in which their original audience would have done, and with the same mechanics with which these compositions were conceived during their own time. Three elements of the inscription An epigraphic dedication belonging to a series of inscriptions from victorious commanders who conquered cities during the third and second centuries BC shows both the conciseness and the syntactic co-dependency of the textual elements and the object displayed. The inscription and dedication, now lost, but recorded in CIL, was found in Rome on the Esquiline. It was set up after the conquest of Enna in 214 BC by M. Claudius Marcellus, consul quinquies, conqueror of Syracuse: M(arcus) Claudius M(arci) f(ilius) / consol / Hinnad cepit.15 Like L. Quinctius Flamininus’ inscription in Praeneste, this inscription is commonly translated with the inclusion of the direct object in the form of “this”, despite its absence from the text. For example: “Marcus Claudius, consul, son of Marcus, took this as booty from Henna”;16 or “M. Claudius, son of Marcus, consul, took this from Hinna”.17 The word “this” is not present in Latin, and such an omission is respected in my translation in order to better understand the interconnection between the object dedicated by Marcellus and its inscriptions. A different translation is thus possible: 15 Rome; CIL I2 608. Extensive bibliography in Cadario 2005. See also Edwards 2003 on the displays of spoils as art in Rome. 16 Warmington 1940, 77. 17 Riggsby 2006, 218.', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 105 Marcus Claudius (Marcellus), son of Marcus, consul, took from Enna. This inscription was carved on a base of a piece of artwork taken from Enna and displayed in Rome to celebrate the conquest of the city by Marcellus in 214 BC through the combination of the inscription and the artwork.18 The text of the inscription is composed of three lines and elements present in the text are grammatically incomplete: the dedicator is expressed in the nominative case followed by the filiation; the status of the dedicator as consul is in apposition to the subject; and the active perfect of capere together with the ablative of separation identifies the location from which the object dedicated was taken.19 Missing from this textual construction are at least two elements: the accusative direct object dependent on cepit; and the dative of interest, implied by the dedicatory nature of the inscription. The former is syntactically presented as the object dedicated, which plays the role of a visual accusative. The latter is metaphorically defined by the topographical position in an urban context, which, in turn, defines the kind of audience that the whole composition was addressing: the people of Rome. The analysis of this inscription is here divided into three parts, each of which corresponds to the three lines that constitute the text: the nominative and filiation in the first; the apposition of the subject in the second; and the verb with the ablative of separation in the third. First line: the nominative and filiation In the first line, the name of the dedicator, Marcus Claudius (Marcellus), along with his filiation, is indicated by the nominative case. The hierarchical order created by the syntax suggests the grammatical function of the nominative case as the subject of the action, with the name of Marcellus directly presenting him as the main actor of the whole composition. The filiation, which is rarely omitted in this category of inscriptions, subsequently follows Marcellus’ name, completing its semantics.20 In this concise inscription, the filiation assumes a meaningful role in strengthening the relationship between the Claudii Marcelli and the Urbs and its institution. The Claudii Marcelli family had already produced two consuls: Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 331 BC and his son Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 287 BC. The latter was also the grandfather of the conqueror of Syracuse. The filiation Marci filius works as reminder of 18 See Livy 24.39 for the narrative of the conquest of Enna. 19 A first approach to foreign names of cities conquered by Roman people happened during the pompa triumphalis. See Östenberg 2009b; Cadario 2011, 31–2; 2014, 86–7; Tarpin 2011, 683–4. 20 The few exceptions include Corneli(us) / Scipio /Cartha(gine) / capta (CIL I2 625); L. Mummius cos. / vico (CIL I2 627); L. Mumius / co(n)s(ul) ded(it) N(ursinis) (CIL I2 628); L. Mummius / co(n)s(ul) p(opulo) P(armensi) (CIL I2 629); L. Mummius / co(n)s(ul) Achea capta (CIL I2 631). These inscriptions were not located in Rome and they follow different self-promotion strategies. The first case adopts the Saturnian meter, typical of the Scipionic epitaphs and inscriptions, in which the filiation is not always canonically used. Through the chiastic position (ABBA) of its textual elements, the inscription emphasizes the role of Scipio in conquering Carthage. Mummius’ tituli will be addressed later in this section. See Graverini 2001.', '106 Fabio Luci the consulships obtained by Claudius Marcellus’ ancestors.21 The filiation of the Claudii Marcelli assumed more emphatic tones during the second century BC with M. Claudius Marcellus, consul in 166, 155, and 152 BC and grandson of the five- times consul. He erected three statues near the Temple of Honos and Virtus depicting himself, his father and his grandfather (the consul quinquies), and set up an inscription reported by Asconius that read “III MARCELLI NOVIES COSS”.22 In the case of the triple statue, the filiation is not mentioned in the text, but is highly emphasised by the visual juxtaposition of the statues of the three Marcelli that a Roman reader might reconstruct as M. Claudius Marcellus, Marci filius, Marci nepos. Thus, textual Fig. 5.2: Dedication by M. Fulvius Nobilior in Rome elements strengthen the continuation (Rome, Musei Capitolini, Centrale Montemartini. of a successful career among members Photo: Archivio Fotografico dei Musei Capitolini. © of this family, exalting their important Roma, Sovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali). role in the Republic through the total of their consulships (honores). The filiation, filius and nepos, recalling illustrious predecessors, emphasises and confirms the prestigious socio-political status of the protagonist of the dedication. This strategy had been adopted in the inscription belonging to Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, consul in 189 BC, after his victory against the Aetolians and the capture of the Greek city of Ambracia (Fig. 5.2): M(arcus) Folvius M(arci) f(ilius) / Ser(vi) n(epos) Nobilior / co(n)s(ul) Ambracia cepit.23 Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, son of Marcus, grandson of Servius, consul, took from Ambracia. 21 The link between the filiation and the consulship could have also worked as a means to overshadow an embarrassing episode that happened to Claudius Marcellus, consul in 331, who was at the centre of a controversy during his appointment as dictator in 327 BC. In that occasion he was disapproved by the augurs instigating an interregnum. Livy 8.23.14–17. Cf. Oakley 2005, 84–5. 22 Asc., Pis. 12.15–19.

It is possible that the base and its artwork were dedicated to the Muses in the Aedes Herculis Musarum, which was erected by the same M. Fulvius Nobilior. Cf. Cic., Arch. 11.17; Plin., HN 35.66. Cf.

Epigraphic strategies of communication 107 The grandfather of M. Fulvius Nobilior was Servius Fulvius Paetinus, consul in 255 BC, who celebrated a triumph for the victory over Cossyra and a naval triumph over the Carthaginians in 254 BC as proconsul.24 The long filiation bridged the triumph celebrated by Fulvius Paetinus with one of his grandsons, showing a continuity of the gens Fulvia in defeating powerful enemies of Rome. Furthermore, the parallelism between Nobilior and his grandfather emphasizes the consulships that both had held and, at the same time, overshadows the lesser prestige of his father, who did not obtain such an office. In Roman honorific inscriptions, filiation is usually expressed with the father’s initial only. In Nobilior’s case, however, the slightly less usual choice of including both father and grandfather suggests that the aim of the subtle strategy conveyed is to emphasize specific members and, therefore, their achievements. A similar strategy was also adopted by the Claudii Marcelli. The evidence is reported by Asconius with the statuary group inscription citing the III Marcelli novies coss. The strategy adopted seems to point to the numeric sum of the consulships held by the three members. In this sense, the presence of the illustrious grandfather Marcellus as well as of the father was fundamental in promoting the political weight of the Marcelli and in counterbalancing the unexceptional single consulship that Marcellus’ father held in 196 BC.25 In this case, the strategy adopted to promote and advertise the role of the Claudii Marcelli is even more evident because Marcellus’ consulship in 215 BC is included in the total: he was forced to resign after a bad omen.26 Similarly to Marcellus’ and Nobilior’s inscriptions, a substantial number of honorific inscriptions belonging to victorious generals follow this syntactic strategy in displaying the nominative and the filiation in the first line of the text.27 Thus, not only was the prestige of individuals celebrated through the main position of their names but, in addition, their achievements were framed as a reflection and consequence of being a member of illustrious gentes and familiae, which were evoked and brought into the action through filiation. In our inscription, then, Marcellus followed an established pattern that emphasized his noble lineage. Second line: the apposition In the second line of CIL I2 608, the apposition completes and identifies the subject as consul. The apposition following the name is almost ubiquitous in Republican honorific inscriptions, qualifying the status of the subject of the dedication with his office. In the case of M. Claudius Marcellus’ inscription, consul stands alone between 24 Zonar. (Cass.

Its position in the line helps to emphasize the meaning of the word, at the same time stressing the relevance of the office obtained by Claudius and members of his family. In other words, the function of the consulship displayed in such a way is not merely limited to emphasizing the prestigious office held, but also establishes the connection between his name and the action of the verb in the third line. It was Marcellus’ consulship that gave him the authority to lead Rome’s army and capture booty to dedicate.28 The consulship, expressed syntactically as the apposition of subject, was specifically used as a leitmotif by the Claudii Marcelli in promoting their achievements. For example, the textual strategy adopted by the inscription of the tres Marcelli novies consules focuses on the total of the consulates achieved by three members of the family. The adoption of this syntactic strategy persists and is emphasized over time in other inscriptions, connecting the conqueror of Syracuse (CIL I2 608 and CIL I2 609, Martei / M(arcus) Claudius M(arci) f(ilius) / consol dedit) to his descendants. For instance, the grandson M. Claudius Marcellus, who was consul in 155 BC, erected his statue in the Forum of Luna29 to celebrate his victory against the Apuani, a Ligurian community.30 M. Claudius M(arci) f(ilius) Marcelus / consol iterum.31 Marcus Claudius Marcellus, son of Marcus, consul for the second time. The legacy of the consulships held by the Claudii Marcelli is still present and evoked during the middle of the first century BC with a denarius minted by the triumvir monetalis P. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus in 50 BC that shows on the reverse the episode of the spolia opima obtained by M. Claudius Marcellus at Clastidium in 222 BC and dedicated to the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius with the inscription Marcellus cos quinq(uies).32 In both inscriptions of Marcellus and Nobilior, the consulship (consol and consul) are placed on the second line; yet, they have slightly different meanings. The second line of Nobilior’s inscription includes both the filiation and the consulship to link his office with his famous grandfather, Paetinus, who was victorious against the Carthaginians. This establishes a connection with his own deeds in capturing Ambracia, overshadowing the criticism as to how he conducted his war.33 Conversely, 28 For the booty used by M. Claudius Marcellus as “cultural capital”, in the words of Bourdieu 1984, 53–4, see Holliday 2002, 196–7. Cf.

Claudius Marcellus’ consulship stands alone to emphasize the outstanding and well-known deeds of the general.34 The two examples demonstrate the versatility of the textual strategies used: the semantics of the apposition (consul) can, or cannot, be reinforced by other textual elements such as the filiation, as in the case of Nobilior. Third line: verb and ablative The third line of M. Claudius Marcellus’ inscription is composed of cepit, the perfect active verb of capere (take), and Hinnad as the ablative of separation that identifies the location in which the object dedicated was originally placed. The verb cepit (took) emphasizes the action performed by military commanders towards hostile cities and enemies. Syntactically speaking, the verb is at the very heart of the whole text, introducing and combining different elements of the inscription. The subject of the action is M(arcus) Claudius M(arci) f(ilius), who performed it through the imperium militiae suggested by the apposition consol. The ablative of separation Hinnad specifies and brings into the action the victim of the conquest. Therefore, the verb does not only emphasize the action performed by the subject, but also directly address the iter that produced the composition through the ablative of separation. Both subject and action act together to emphasize the existence of the whole composition itself as the result of their combination: individual (Marcellus) + legitimate authority (cos) + military victory (cepit) = benefit to city (artwork). The combination of cepit with the inscription’s other textual elements achieves the specific aim of celebrating both the military victory and the political dominance of Marcellus. The grammatical function of cepit is to introduce a fundamental part of the syntax: the accusative. The direct object is not textually mentioned; this does not mean that it is not present. The metaphorical syntax can supply the missing textual accusative giving the grammatical function to the artwork itself. The “visual accusative” embodied by the artwork is integrated with the inscription by the verb that syntactically demands a direct object that is absent in the linguistic form. Primarily, this strategy aims to emphasize the message carried by the whole composition, entailing a dynamic reading process that demands from the audience a scrutiny encompassing both its visuality and its textuality. The verb cepit, in conjunction with Hinnad, contains in itself the energetic action that gives life to the composition, this being the result of a series of events. The creation of this kind of monumentum starts from the consulship obtained by an individual through which he was able to overcome enemies of Rome, expressed by the location in which the artwork was originally situated. The energetic action 34 On the campaign, Polyb. 2.34–5; Plut., Marc. 6–8; Frontin., Str. 4.5.4; Eutrop. 3.6; Oros. 4.13.15; Zonar. 8.20; Livy Per. 20; Naev., Fr. Praetext. In Varro, Ling. 9.78. For the conquest of Syracuse see MRR I, 273. The perception of Syracuse as a powerful and beautiful city exalts the propaganda around Marcellus’ victory. Marcellus obtained this victory as a consul; therefore, the military and victorious aspects are contained in the meaning of the consulship. See Livy 26.21; Holliday 2002, 112; Cadario 2005, 154. On the comparison between Marcellus and Nobilior’s triumphs, see Östenberg 2009a, 208–12.', '110 Fabio Luci expressed by the verb ends with the creation of the composition. The statue assumes a new role: now, it commemorates the deeds that produced it and emphasizes the exemplum of the individual’s virtus as a model to admire and follow.35 Thus, the verb, in its indispensable function of expressing the action of the sentence and clarifying its meaning, has a privileged role compared to the other elements of the monument in that it renews and perpetuates the political message of the action. The emphatic tone of cepit is strengthened by the ablative of separation, which in most cases is placed immediately before it.36 In Marcellus’ inscription, Hinnad is where the action of the verb takes place, recalling the Sicilian military campaign and, thus, the victory of the Roman command. The word Hinnad is a Latin word, although archaic, and is a transcription of the toponym Ἔννα.37 The name of the place from which the Greek artwork was plundered creates a picture in the viewers’ mind of the setting of the victorious military campaign conducted against a powerful enemy of Rome. The phrase Hinnad cepit makes clear the meaning also demonstrated by the act of putting a piece of Greek captured art on display in Rome. The artwork would have been Greek, and likely had a Greek inscription in its original location; in Rome it was carved a Latin inscription, which “translated” and altered its meaning. Both the artwork and the inscription were re-functionalized in favour of Marcellus’ self-presentation strategy.38 It is not surprising that the massive haul of loot taken from the Sicilian campaign was used in this way by Marcellus to decorate the Temple of Honos and Virtus.39 This behaviour was not uncommon: the columna rostrata dedicated to C. Duilius after his naval victory in 260 BC against Hannibal and the Carthaginians was adorned with the ramming “beaks” of captured enemy ships.40 Through the appropriation and re-functionalization of concrete objects, the superiority of Rome over powerful and foreign enemies was reaffirmed by specifying the location where the military actions were performed by the Roman commanders. Hölscher distinguished the function of expressing “the political entities, states and statements” through their visuality.41 Accordingly, the monuments are “power and weapons” leaving no chance for an interpretation other than political importance, 35 Cf. Hölkeskamp 2004, 180–3. 36 CIL I2 608: ...Hinnad cepit; CIL I2 608: ...Leucado cepit; CIL I2 615: ...Ambracia cepit; CIL I2 616: ...Aetolia cepit; AE 1993, 643: ...Heraclea cepit; CIL I2, 2926: ...Scarphea cepit. Cf. CIL I2 626. Another group of inscriptions, although they feature ablative absolutes, follow the same structure: CIL I2 631: ...Achaia capta; CIL I2 630: ...Corintho capta; CIL I2 625: ...Carthagine capta. 37 Clackson and Horrocks 2007, 131–2; Wallace 2011, 18. 38 For political implications of displaying spoils of war see Holliday 2002; Hölscher 2006; Östenberg 2009a. 39 Cf. Livy 25.24.11, 26.21. The display of spoils was not limited to the temple, but was also in Marcellus’ house. For instance, the disposition of the sphaerae of Archimedes: one, the finest, kept in his house as the unique loot that was personally held; and another sphaera displayed in his temple for public consumption (Cic., Rep. 1.21). See Bravi 2012, 29–32. 40 Plin., HN 34.11.20; Sil., Pun. 6.663–6; Quint., Inst. 1.7.12. 41 Hölscher 2006, 27–48 is fundamental, especially 27–8. See also Holliday 2002.', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 111 Fig. 5.3: Votive dedication by M. Claudius Marcellus in Rome (National Archaeological Museum of Naples). whether it was accepted and celebrated or opposed and destroyed. Textual elements, as part of the monument, represent these political entities and states in a more direct way. The foreign textual name of a place from which the artwork was taken, Hinnad in this case, informed the viewer about the geographical military expedition, even before he/she looked at the formal and stylistic features of the foreign artwork. Even when spectators did not know where Enna was, it had the same effect: by not knowing, the viewers acknowledged that the place was far away or even exotic. Another inscription concerning Marcellus presents a different strategy, although the construction is similar (Fig. 5.3). Martei / M(arcus) Claudius M(arci) f(ilius) / consol dedit [vov(it)].42 To Mars, Marcus Claudius (Marcellus), son of Marcus, consul, gave [(vowed)]. The composition comes from the same event, but its textual elements suggest a slightly different meaning. The verb dedit (“gave”), was carved over an already existing inscription: vovit (“vowed”). The word vovit was not clearly erased and is still 42 CIL I2 609.', '112 Fabio Luci visible on the epigraph. This might suggest the desire to show the different events simultaneously: the vow to Mars beforehand, and the accomplishment of the vow through dedit afterwards. Initially, Marcellus expressed a vow to honour Mars and once his achievement had been accomplished the wording was replaced with the verb dedit (to give); the dative of interest, Martei, underlines the recipient: Mars. Unlike in the case of CIL I2 608, in which the dative of interest must be inferred from the context, the textual dative of interest and the topographical position of the whole composition emphasize the relationship between Marcellus and Mars.43 Although the artworks cannot be investigated, it is evident from the different textual elements of the two inscriptions that the political meaning carried by the two compositions followed different strategies and must be read in different ways. CIL I2 608 emphasizes Marcellus’ legitimation as consul and his military victory; CIL I2 609 adds to the former inscription the pietas of Marcellus through the dedication to Mars. The dedication set up by L. Quinctius Flamininus at Praeneste in 192 BC, already presented above (Fig. 5.1), gives another example of how the verb(s) of an inscription work(s) with the visual object: [L. Quinctius L(uci) f(ilius) Le]ucado cepit / [eidem conso]l dedit.44 Lucius Quinctius, son of Lucius, took from Leucadus, he gave as consul. Quinctius Flamininus was a legatus under the command of his younger (and better- known) brother Titus, who conquered Leucas in 197 BC during the war against Philip V of Macedon. He set up this dedication in the Temple of Fortuna in Praeneste, but only during his consulship in 192 BC. The inscription consists of two lines, each with a different verb: cepit (“took”) and dedit (“gave”). The syntactic strategy used by Flamininus relies on the double integration of the visual accusative in the sentence meanings. This double integration might be explained considering the different status of Flamininus between the victory and his consulship. The first integration of the visual accusative in the sentence in which the verb “take” appears works as a reminder of the exceptional military deed achieved by Flamininus during the war, although he was not consul. The second integration of the visual accusative represented by the verb “give” emphasizes his generosity when he finally obtained the consulship. This analysis has underlined the existence of a pattern followed by many honorific dedications set by commanders during the third and second centuries BC: artworks dedicated with short inscriptions including the donor’s name, filiation, and office along with a verb indicating the action commemorated and often either an ablative of separation or a dative of interest. The direct object of the verb, the artwork itself, is almost always omitted from the inscription. These inscriptions are similar in their structure as they all omit the accusative direct object, but they also differ slightly 43 On Marcellus’ piety, Val. Max. 1.1.8. 44 CIL I2 613.', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 113 from each other. The syntactic strategies used by the patrons in their dedicatory texts show a significant amount of dynamism. This is because patrons had different political strategies according to their own life experiences and backgrounds. These strategies, visible as result of a single narrative created by the syntax between text and art, influenced the way the audience understood, interacted with, and responded to these compositions. In other words, monuments and inscriptions are intertwined and cannot be separated by carrying out two different analyses, and their syntax created potential “guidelines” on how to “read” the whole composition and translate it into a single narrative. At this point, the political significance of the events that produced the whole composition was effectively communicated to the audience, because they actively participated in restoring the meanings of the compositions. Visual accusative and the audience So far, I have argued that Roman monuments and their inscriptions are strongly interconnected. They are complementary to each other, rather than being two separate and distinct objects merely assembled together. Their connection is established by the combination of artworks and inscriptions, the result of which is single and consistent sets. To understand the mechanism behind these combinations it is necessary to look at the way monuments and inscriptions interact with each other. Such a mechanism can be analyzed by considering artworks and their inscriptions as part of the same grammatical sentence. As in all sentences, the parts follow rules regulated by a specific syntax. This mechanism is, however, a passive agent and needs a catalyst to be triggered. The catalyst are the people who approach the monuments. The restoration of a sentence, created by the combination of a monument and its inscriptions, can be accomplished only by the viewers, who were induced to complete the sentence by logically placing each textual and visual element in the right grammatical order. Once the syntax is respected, the narrative of the inscribed monument is restored, delivering its precise and unmistakable message to the audience. Accordingly, the active participation of the audience was fundamental to accomplish the mechanics of the interaction between the artwork and its inscription. As we have seen in the previous examples, omitting the direct object in the inscriptions of plundered artworks that were rededicated in Rome was a deliberate choice made and a syntactic strategy adopted by dedicators to push the viewers to look at their artworks as the direct objects of the inscriptions. The relationship between the visual accusative and the audience is discussed here according to three main points: first, the visual accusative mechanism within the honorific practice and its strength in being adopted by the audience; second, the attitude and reaction of the audience towards the use of the visual accusative for restoring the meaning of honorary dedications; and, finally, the result and its effect on the audience.', '114 Fabio Luci The strength of the visual accusative relies on the easy way in which it can engage, and be engaged by, the audience. The honorific system in which the visual accusative is developed as a tool for its syntactic strategies has a peculiar characteristic: it is marked by very simple and concise syntaxes. In the previous example, all the inscriptions paired with plundered artworks are composed of only a very few lines with a very few and simple words. On the one hand, this particular aspect eased the process of integration of the visual artworks as the direct object of the sentence as understood by the audience. A simple text is easy to approach, and the integration of the visual accusative delivers a straightforward message: a certain object has been taken by the military actions of a certain consul of the Republic. On the other hand, the simple and concise syntax responded to the need to address the vast majority of people, even those who were illiterate, in a way that all would understand, by the repetition of the honorific practice and the use of simple inscriptions. By writing a very simple sentence structure on an ongoing basis – subject and transitive verb – the absence of the direct object was evident. In the previous example the honorific inscriptions are formed by subject, filiation, apposition of the subject (i.e., his title), and the missing direct object. It would be immediately clear to the viewers what the object was that had been plundered and rededicated in one of Rome’s public places or in a temple. Looking at Marcellus’ inscription, Marcus Claudius (Marcellus), son of Marcus, consul, took from Enna, by not including the direct object, the viewers would naturally think about what Marcellus took from Enna. To complete the sentence’s meaning, a viewer had to literally “look around” for the missing direct object. This task can be achieved only by considering the artwork itself, which is set up over the inscribed base, as the direct object of the sentence. As matter of fact, there cannot be any other elements that could fit into the syntax. The catalyst for the completion of the sentence meaning is the viewers. Using the visual object as the direct object they rebuild the syntax of the sentence and, therefore, its meaning. The process of integrating the artwork as the direct object of the inscription syntax of the visual object in the textual syntax is triggered by the reaction of the viewers in approaching an incomplete inscription. The incompleteness of a very simple and concise inscription prompts a “tension” in the audience and pushes them to find a way to complete it. The simplicity of these inscriptions is fundamental in triggering such tensions in the audience because it significantly emphasizes the missing direct object and, at the same time, avoids the requirement for special knowledge or philological skills to reintegrate it. It was only necessary to look at the artwork to find the missing element of the sentence. Finally, the tension created by the incompleteness of the inscription secured the reaction of the people by inducing them to actively participate in the syntactic restoration. The reaction of the people towards an incomplete sentence is prioritized here. It is true that nothing would have stopped the viewers from looking first at the visual object and only afterwards at its inscription. It is almost certain that for anybody walking towards a composition consisting of an artwork and inscription, the first', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 115 element to be noticed would be the artwork. In looking at a composition, the visual object is prioritized, but mostly because it is far more scenic than an inscription, especially if approached from a distance. This scenario is similar to what happens when we step into a museum. We immediately look at the physical objects – the archaeological finds, paintings, and statues – and usually only afterwards do we focus on the description of the various items. The main difference is that with regard to the rededicated spoils of war during the Roman Republic, their inscriptions were not captions, but were an inseparable part of the whole composition, and no different from a torso or arm fragments that were once part of a statue. A caption describes an item, but an inscription defines it. Even by looking first at the artwork and only after this at its inscription, a syntactic reconstruction is required. If a viewer first looked at an artwork, he/she would not easily understand the meaning of that dedication. An inscribed monument could be erected for many reasons and by many agents: by a benefactor from the same city; by another community; by a foreign king; or by a commander after his military campaign, as in our cases. The inscription is fundamental in giving a meaning to the whole composition and offering a full experience to the viewers who approach it. In addition, in Latin, the accusative case can also be used at the beginning of a sentence. Similarly, the visual accusative could have been the first element of the syntax that was approached by the viewers; nevertheless, the rest of the sentence must be integrated as well to complete the significance of the artwork. The result of using the visual accusative as a virtual tool for comprehending honorific dedications shows how the dialogue between artworks and their inscriptions relied on the response of the audience, whose main task consisted of combining these visual and textual elements to form a single and harmonious set. In this case, such dialogue was firmly secured by the synergy between the active participation of the audience and the visual and textual components of the monuments themselves. By using the visual accusative, the viewers transformed two apparently separate and different elements – the artwork and the inscription – into a single narrative, which was, ultimately, embodied by the whole honorific dedication. In other words, viewers completed the final stage of a rededicated plundered artwork and, therefore, the message of its dedicator. The effect that the syntactic reintegration of the visual accusative within the inscription had on the audience is at the core of the syntactic strategies adopted by patrons. The process of reconstructing the syntax of the monument by the audience also restored its message. As has been argued in the previous sections, the patron’s preferences and self-presentation strategies decided the kind of message. What is interesting to observe here is the effect that this process had on the audience. The viewers, by restoring the message created by the combination of textual and visual elements of a single monument did not only rebuild the message of the patron; the active participation of the audience in re-establishing the full meaning of the sentence helped to reproduce, acknowledge, and fix in the memory the event behind the', '116 Fabio Luci dedication. The memory of a historical fact is renewed in the collectivity. For example, the restoration of Marcellus’ inscription analyzed before imparts fundamental information: that Marcellus conquered and plundered Enna. Further, consequences are deduced by the historical fact of Marcellus’ conquest of Enna, such as his military abilities, his virtus, his success against an enemy of Rome and his generosity towards the people of Rome in decorating the city. Marcellus’ victory is constantly repeated over time by whoever engages in reading his dedication. This kind of honorific dedication worked as “hubs” of information from which the people of Rome could acknowledge the military achievements of an illustrious member of the nobilitas. The process of acknowledgement stems from the active participation of viewers in reconstructing the syntax of the visual and textual elements of these monuments. In other words, the audience renewed the events behind the dedications by (re-)building them every time they engaged with the compositions. The consequences of their active participation strengthened the shared knowledge of the society about specific events because the restoration process through the syntax could, without a doubt, be performed by anyone and easily shared. Most importantly, these monuments are fundamental to understanding the relationship between history and its transformation into memory, in this case, the creation of the Roman Republican cultural memory and the topographical “landscape” of memory in Rome.45 Such “monumental memory” was a distinctive feature of the Roman Republic, and its topography focused on the most important public space in Rome, because an interplay between locations and history, and between public and religious functions of monuments and past events in Rome was vital for making sense of this type of memory. Viewers walking through the monumental cityscape and looking around obviously reinforced the construction of the cultural memory of Rome, especially through the exposition of historical events monumentalized and fixed in the urban topography of Rome. Rituals and processions, whether triumphs or public funerals, had a significant role in constructing the cultural memory of Rome.46 It is true that these processions were fundamental in reinforcing the cultural memory and identity of Rome, especially because their routes passed through the monumental cityscape. However, in much of modern scholarship, it is not stressed enough how the audience were “reading” the spectrum of mythical or historical events embodied by honorific dedications either during the processions or on normal days.47 The visual accusative gives a more definite 45 See especially Hölkeskamp 2006a; 2006b. 46 Hölkeskamp 2006b. 47 There is a wide bibliography on the spectacle, ceremonies, and representation of power. A selective list: Veyne 1967; Scullard 1981; Price 1984; Hopkins 1991; Bergmann 1999; Beacham 1999; Flaig 2003; Bell 2004; Flower 2004; Sumi 2005; Hölkeskamp 2004; 2006a; Hölscher 2006; Östenberg 2009a; Galinsky 2016. However, none of these works engages with the practical involvement of the audience with the monuments and their inscriptions.', '5. Epigraphic strategies of communication 117 answer to this because it avoids sweeping statements about viewers simply “walking through the monumental landscape of Rome and looking around”.48 Finally, the syntactic model also offers a further distinction between the role of dedications, such as spoils of war, and that of other kinds of monuments, such as honorific statues or temples. Through the syntactic reconstruction of their messages by the audience, the events behind them were evoked and fixed into the viewers’ memory, once, of course, the task of integrating the visual accusative within the inscription was completed. This series of information was complementary to other forms of monumentalization, such as statues of individuals and temples. The heterogeneity of the monuments created a historical and celebrative “map”, simple to understand, and that worked according to the needs of the patrons. Conclusion The syntactic methodology expounded shows the potential for considering monuments and inscriptions as a single consistent and inseparable set. Words and visual elements work synergistically to produce a single narrative and fulfil the specific communication strategies of the dedicators. The examples discussed show the importance of reconstructing the connection between art and text, especially with regard to understanding how crucial the role of inscriptions was in reshaping the meaning of the monuments and its interaction with the audience. Further considerations originate from this kind of approach. The assumption that Rome’s Republican artworks are completely lost can be contested. Inscriptions and artworks were conceived as a whole by their dedicators and consumed as a whole by their recipients. It is thus possible to rebuild what the monument was, in terms of significance and impact to its audience. The inscriptions played a fundamental role in defining artworks’ meanings, rather than being merely a decoration or a legend. This process shows how inscriptions are syntactically linked with their artworks. The interplay between texts and images pushes the audience to participate actively in completing the meaning of their sentence, rebuilding the narrative that the whole composition intended to convey. The Roman Republican inscriptions of honorific monuments were concise, simple in their choice of the lexicon, and relatively standardized in their formula. Words like consul, cepit, dedit, were immediately recognized by their vast presence in Rome and its institutions, as well as having a simple, yet strong, meaning. Reading such short texts, syntactically combined with fine foreign artworks, enhanced their communicative power and resonance. Accordingly, the interplay between text and artwork can improve our understanding of how the 48 I here refer to Hölkeskamp 2006a, 483, who argues that: “not only can such a landscape be ‘read’ like a text, since it stores the full spectrum of myths, historical, etiological and other stories – it can also be experienced directly, by Roman citizens as viewers, in the concrete sense of walking through it and looking around” (emphasis mine). Hölkeskamp is right to assert the “readability” of landscape, but has not given a sufficiently strong account of how it was read by viewers.', '118 Fabio Luci audience approached and interacted with the honorific practice. Patrons shaped their messages in a way that best suited their own needs and purposes by adopting specific syntactic strategies. Subsequently, when the viewers approached a monument, a complex or any brand new or recently refurbished building, they searched for the inscriptions. Once found, the viewers could fully appreciate and understand the significance of the whole composition and memorialize the historical event behind it. Finally, when the artwork was paired with an inscription, as was normal practice in the ancient world, the relationship between art and text became so strong that the two narratives merged into a single and more consistent whole.
