IS.—"Why f Believe\nin tile Bible" was the subject chosen\nby Dr. Allen G. Hall, dean of the Law jjtj\nDepartment of Vanderbilt University,\nfor an address last night at the First\nPresbyterian church. Dr. Hall said:\n"The Bible is of lowly origin. Tin\nwriters were not learned literary men,\nbut uneducated working men. There\nwere no great potentate to herald its\ncoming; no one dared proclaim its\ngreatness when it came; yet today\nmen and nations are judged by its\nstandards. After centuries have pass\ned, this volume is found in the van of\nevery movement into savage and un\ncivilized countries. It is the rock upon\nwhich civilization is founded. It has\nbetween its covers that which is of In\nterest to all classes of men. Some are\nattracted by its history, some by its\npoetry, some by its allegory and oth\ners by its parables."\nDr. Hall dwelt at length upon the\nadaptation of the scriptures to men\nand nations. "There are men," he\nsaid, "who disbelieve certain portions\nof the Bible, and characterize events\ngiven therein as impossible. To man\nthere are things which are impossible,\nbut to God nothing is so, as we have\nevidence in the regeneration of men\nabout us every day. Man can not\nchange the stone into a rose, no mat\nter how assiduously he attends it, yet\nj God daily changes t he sin-encrusted\nI heart to a well of love and kindness.\nI Do I understand all\nI Scriptures? I do not.\nj accept them. I know that mysteries\nI occur today, and why could they not\nj have occurred centuries ago? As to\n\' the authorship of the Bible. I am not\nj so much interested in whether Moses\nj wrote the Pentateuch as I am in the\n[fact that we have it."\n! In conclusion Dr. Hall said that, inas\n\' much as we owe all we are and all\nj ihat we have to the Bible, it should he\nI taught in the public schools.\nV<\n■\n■\nthings in the\nI do better.
