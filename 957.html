        <pre>['Religious security in vietnam today \nLan Hien Do1,* \n1Institute of Religion and Belief, Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics, 135 Nguyen Phong Sac \nStr., Cau Giay District, Hanoi \nAbstract. For a long time, social awareness still asserts that religion with \na supernatural belief system will bring people peace and help believers face \nchallenges of life. People who perform religious rituals will create a \n"mechanism" to fight stress, reduce psychological stress, and even cure \nillnesses. But another reality exists, religious beliefs can be a factor \ncausing people to behave in the wrong way such as killing innocent people, \ncommitting suicide or threatening the right to life, the right to political, \nsocial stability, the right to religious freedom of others. Religion can \nbecome an opportunity, power to control human security, community \nsecurity, social security, more extensively national security and ideological \nmaintenance of that nation. Therefore, it is necessary to study the topic of \nreligious security adequately with the extent of its influence. In this article, \nI will analyze the current situation of religious security in Vietnam by \nassessing the religious activities. \n1 Introduction \nThe religious topic is concerned with not only the "sacred" and "ontological" issues of \nreligion, but also religious security because religion is at the foundation of the current \ninternational order and greatly influences world peace. Religion is a set of factors (not to be \nmissed) in national and international security, but not many governments put religious \nsecurity on the forefront, religion is not closely integrated into security as it should be. The \nsolidarity between religious security and political, economic, cultural, social and human \nsecurity is a recognized fact. Economic, political and cultural factors can bring challenges \nto religious security, whereas religion will also be a factor that brings instability to \neconomic, political and cultural security and moreover national security and the country\'s \nsustainable development. The current situation of religious security in Vietnam is not so \nmuch as a "red" alert. However, religious security in the world and in Vietnam is getting \nmore and more complex. Increasing religious conflicts about not only religious freedom, \nbut also political rights, economic rights and other human rights. \nAddressing religious security requires not only just a single country but it is also an \ninternational matter. In order to ensure religious security in Vietnam, in my opinion, the \nfactors that threaten religious security should be removed. \n \n                                                 \n*Corresponding author: dolanhien67@gmail.com \nE3S Web of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n  © The Authors,  published  by EDP Sciences.

It is the \nability to maintain safety against all threats. \nEnsuring security, maintaining safety from threats can allow an individual or an \norganization to take any action including that it may affect or harm an individual or certain \ngroup of people considered to be a threat to security. \nSubject of security can be a human being, a social group, an organization or any other \nentity or phenomenon. \nPreviously, the traditional approach to security was directed at the subjects of the state \nand the nation. The term “national security” is simply understood as protecting the country \nagainst military attacks, wars of aggression on territorial borders and armed demonstrations, \nterrorism, civil war in the country to protect political regimes, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity. Measures to protect national security often emphasize military, political and \ndiplomatic measures. \nSince the 90s (twentieth century), the trend of globalization, environmental degradation, \nclimate change, terrorism, international crime and epidemics has been increasing, opening \nup new contents for security concept. Happening of an alternative approach to the \ntraditional studies on security from military to non-military aspects, from the subjects of the \nstate to the subjects of people and organizations. Threats to security have been extended to \neconomic, political, cultural, religious and human factors. Non-traditional security term \nappears. \nAccording to OSCE (Organization for Security and co-operation in Europe), security is \nfully and comprehensively understood as cooperation, equality, non-division of human \nrights in the fields of politics, military, economy, environment and human, ensuring \nsecurity for all fields is considered of equal importance [OSCE,  Freedom of Religion or \nBelief and Security, Policy Guidance, Published by the OSCE Office for Democratic \nInstitutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). www.osce.org/odihr/2019]. \nSince OSCE is an organization of the European Office for Democracy and Human \nRights, the security topic in terms of OSCE\'s understanding is related to issues of \ndemocracy and human rights, especially religious freedom. Accordingly, religious freedom \nis specifically recognized as one of the basic principles, an indispensable aspect in the \nconcept of security. It emphasizes the link between security and complete respect for \nfreedom of thought, conscience and religion. Peace and security are only achieved when \nreligious freedom is guaranteed on the basis of recognition of religious diversity, the right \nto profess and practice of belief. Religious freedom is the foundation for a flourishing and \nsustainable society. Religious freedom contributes to respect, trust, understanding and \nE3S Web of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n2\n', 'equality of different ethnic groups. Therefore, it can make society more resilient to security \nthreats [OSCE,  Freedom of Religion or Belief and Security, Policy Guidance, Published by \nthe OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). \nwww.osce.org/odihr/2019]. Religious freedom is also a means of mobilizing and \nfacilitating positive resources of religious community to participate in social life. \nUnreasonable restrictions on religious freedom will obscure the potential of religion in \nbuilding a society where security is guaranteed. \nThus, religious security is not an isolated concept associated only with religion, but it is \nrelated to political, economic, cultural, national and international security. Religious \nsecurity is both a  form of traditional security (related to political factors, state, military, \nriots, subversion, terrorism) and non-traditional security (non-military, non-local, non-state, \nrelated to the spirit, ideology, culture, psychology, emotions, people). Religious security is \na component of national security, or in other words, national security covers many security \nelements, including religious security. Religion plays a "dual role" in the issue of national \nsecurity, it can both create and promote national order by initiatives, ideas, even by the \nmovement to fight for peace. But religion itself is the "catalyst" that triggers the "fuses" of \nconflicts, wars, terrorism, and mass murder. The link between religion and terrorism as well \nas war is a fact that has been well documented in recent decades in the world. In many \ncases, religion is the factor, the opportunity, the power to control human security, \ncommunity security, social security,... more extensively national security. Although it can \nbe exaggerated in many cases so that people become hostile to religion, the government \nbecomes prejudiced, wary of religion and has completely forgotten the ability to use \nreligion itself to resolve conflicts, preserve security and sustain national and international \ndevelopment. \nIn short, religious security is understood: (1) Being able to maintain religious stability, \nall religious activities are not disturbed, do not threaten the stability of life of people and the \nnation, as well as political institutions; (2) Religious organizations and governments have \nthe ability to resist the potential harms affecting religious stability; (3) Factors threaten \nreligious stability; (4) Forces, behavior and systems of measures to protect religious safety; \n(5) The beneficiary of religious security is a person or community (social groups), a \nreligious organization, a government or state; (6) Factors that challenge religious security \nmay come from outside religion, but may be from religion itself. \n3.2 Overview of the situation of religious security in Vietnam today \nThe following assessments of areas related to religion show the level of religious security \n(safety) or religious insecurity (uncontrollable) in Vietnam today. \n3.2.1 Assessment of the level and needs of faith \nIn the Documents and Resolutions of the Party and the State of Vietnam, it is said that \nreligion is the spiritual needs of a part of the masses. However, the reality of religious life \nin Vietnam today shows that a large number of people have religious needs. At present, \nnearly 26 million people (accounting for 27% of the population) are followers of 16 \nreligions [Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Cao Dai, Hoa Hao Buddhism, Tu \nan Hieu nghia, Buu son Ky huong, Minh su, Minh ly - Tam tong temple, Hieu nghia Ta lon \nBuddhism, Tinh do cu si Buddha, Cham Brahmin, Bahai, Mocmon (The Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints), the Complete Gospel Church of Vietnam] (recognized by the \nState) regularly participating in rituals and religious activities. More than 45 million \nVietnamese (accounting for nearly 50% of the population) have taken refuge in the Three \nJewels and also regularly participate in the practice of worshiping at Buddhist worship \nE3S Web of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n3\n', 'facilities or at private home (Worship at Home) [https://thuvienhoasen.org/a32746/thongke-so-luong-tin-do-phat-giao-tren-the-gioi].\nMany people often go to the pagoda to listen to \nteaching on the Dharma, practice meditation to improve their health, cure diseases or find \nspiritual peace. 95% of the population are more or less engaged in ritual acts at religious \nworship facilities or at home. People tend to find "spiritual solutions" when they encounter \nobstacles and unhappiness in life. Forming a "religious market", religion is seen as a \n"commodity" product on the market, the consumers of religious "goods" are the believers, \nthe suppliers of religious "goods" are monks and religious dignitaries. In the "free \ncompetition" market mechanism, religious dignitaries based on the religious needs of \nbelievers will constantly innovate and provide "new commodities" such as medical \ntreatment, pray for dispelling bondholder\'s unjustice, for allaying various illnesses and \nailments, for exorcising repetitive funeral, for assiting soul of the newly deceased, for \neternal fovourable conjugal life, for offsprings, for position and wealth, fortelling fortune,  \nforeseeing  the good or bad days, good and ill luck... to stimulate people\'s "religious \nconsumption" needs, promote the prosperity of their own religion and compete with other \nreligions. The price of this "commodity" is not calculated according to the law of value, \nsometimes it is super costly and superprofitable but customers still voluntarily pay. \nThe religious belief of the people today are moving from passive to active. Particularly, \nin the group of people whose existential safety is threatened with a loss of job, personal \nproperty, house, relatives, work position as well as sickness, divorce, infertility, \nloneliness,they actively seek religions in order to be supported, advised, to improve their \nhealth, to heal, to relieve their frustration. People are willing to pay a not small "fixed" cost \nfor their "consumption and enjoyment" of religion. \nThe believers today are not only the uneducated, the weak, the poor, the unfortunate, but \nalso the educated, successful businessmen, party members, cadres, with the trend of \nrejuvenation. \nIn general, religious belief has a strong secular "fulcrum" (political, economic, social). \nThus, religion is "possessing" opportunities and power to control spiritual security and \nhuman security, more extensively economic and cultural security in Vietnam today. \n3.2.2 The level of religious diversity \nIn a short time (over the past one or two decades ), in Vietnam, the number of staterecognized\nreligious organizations has increased 7-fold. In 1999, only 6 organizations \nbelonging to 6 religions were recognized by the State (Buddhism, Catholicism, \nProtestantism, Islam, Cao Dai and Hoa Hao Buddhism) with about 14.7 million followers \n(about 19.4% of the population). In 2011, it increased to 34 officially recognized \norganizations belonging to 13 religious  with about 25 million believers (accounting for \n28.4% of the population). In 2019, there were 43 organizations belonging to 16 religions \nthat were registered to operateand were recognized as religious legal entities by the State, in \naddition to more than 100 new religious phenomena (not yet licensed and recognized by the \nState) is operating \n[http://btgcp.gov.vn/Plus.aspx/vi/News/38/0/240/0/2263/Tinh_hinh_ton_giao_va_nhung_y\neu_cau_dat_ra_voi_cong_tac_ton_giao]. \nThe most typical of religious diversity is the Protestant case. At the present time (2020), \nProtestantism in the world has about 300 sects and thousands of different Protestant \norganizations. Protestantism entered Vietnam quite late (in 1911), after half a century of \npresence in Vietnam (until 1975), the Protestant had 20 organizations and sects with about \n550 chapters. In the next half century (2015), this number increased 4 times (more than 80 \nsects, 606 chapters and 4,757 groups) [1]. By 2019, only 11 Protestant denominations have \nbeen recognized and granted registration to operate by the State, more than 70 \nE3S Web of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n4\n', 'denominations have not been recognized by the State but still operate normally [Summary \nReport on the work in 2018, the mission in 2019 of the State management on religion and \nbelief of Vietnam (Government Committee for Religious Affairs)]. \nIn particular,the forms of religious practice in private spaces appear (private homes, \noffices, community living areas in apartment buildings, cultural houses in \nvillages/communes) instead of being present at religious worship facilities. These forms of \nritual practice in this private space are the seeds of small, self-governing, spontaneous and \nnon-organized religious groups, making it difficult for the state\'s religious management. \nIn general, the increase in the number of religious organizations and denominations; the \nproliferation of new religious denominations can enrich the religious life in Vietnam and \nsatisfy the multidimensional religious needs of the believers, but it is a significant challenge \nfor religious stability and social safety. On the religious side, the diversity of religious \ndenominations and organizations, and the proliferation of new religious phenomena \nwillcause conflict becauce they are competing to the previous ones to seek a stand, and \nwishing to equitably share the "religious market". On the State side, the diversity of \nreligious sects places the state management agencies in a difficult position. This concerns \nthem about religious harmony, national harmony and worries them about national security. \nTherefore, in many countries, governments often in the name of religious harmony and \nensure national security have strict policies to prevent, not recognize, not grant operating \nregistration for new religious groups (especially those imported from abroad), religious \norganizations (which have been recognized by the State) must guarantee the religious \ngroups, their religious sects, strictly control all activities, all participants. \nReligious diversity is an inevitable and dynamic trend of religions in order to create \nnew, diversified "commodity products" to maximally satisfy the religious needs of the \nbelievers. Religious diversity entails religious competition, demands for legal status. This \nprocess will threaten religious and national security in Vietnam if this issue is not well \ncontrolled. \n3.2.3 Appearance of many new extreme religious phenomena \nCurrently in Vietnam, in addition to 16 religions with 43 organizations and sects that have \nbeen recognized and granted operating registration by the State, there are still many new \nreligious phenomena (imported from abroad into Vietnam) such as Falun Gong (China), \nUnification Church (USA), Om sai Baba (India), I-kuan Tao (China), Supreme Master \nChing Hai (France), Aum (Japan). Hundreds of new (endogenous) religious phenomena \nhave also begun to form, develop and attract followers, draw the attention of public \nopinion. \nThese new religions have names based on traditional Vietnamese religions and beliefs, \nbut their beliefs and practices are strange. The "masters" of these new religions are often \npeople with complex and abnormal mentality. The believers participating in these religions \nare often women, the weak, the disadvantaged and the sick. Joining these new religions, \npeople can find ways to deal "immediately" with a part of the stalemate in their lives (such \nas illness, loneliness, infertility, divorce,...),relieve stress of hot topics in socio-political life \n(such as corruption, inequality, violation of democracy, human rights, unemployment, \npoverty, job loss, land loss, environmental pollution, epidemics, ...) \nThese new religious phenomena often use "magical" means to scare believers by using \nnatural disasters, epidemics, or tribulations so that they have to pay money to the "masters" \nfor worship ceremony in order to help  (Vang Chu, Duong Van Minhreligion), aswell as to \nthreaten if they do not pay, they will be crazy (Long Hoa Maitreya religion), or to offer \nworship to believers (Ho Chi Minh Gem Buddha religion). These new religion practice \n"lucrative" activities such as collecting fees for joining, selling scripture books and \nE3S Web of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n5\n', 'offerings (Long Hoa Maitreya religion, Ho Chi Minh Spirituality), making believers beg for \nalms (Luu Van Ty barefoot religion). Many people, who believe in new and strange \nreligious phenomena, neglect their work, sell their properties, and spend time to worship, \nhoping to go to "Heaven" when natural disasters, floods, crop failures or epidemic occur \n(Vang Chu religion). \nIn general, new religions following extremist trends emphasize personal freedom, \ncompete for a stand, replace traditional religions, and demand a fair share of religious \n"markets".They  demand legal rights like traditional (old) religions, using the followers to \nforce the government to recognize, to give them license in order to operate or to ignore \nthem. It is very difficult for state management agencies in Vietnam to intervene directly in \nthese religions because Vietnam\'s Constitution and Law stipulates the people\'s right to \nreligious freedom. The Vietnamese State can only intervene indirectly in new religious \nphenomena through the judicial system or court when these religions violate the law, are \nsued and accused of violating security and order, endangering people\'s health, money, life \nand dignity. \nIn short, the emergence of new religious phenomena is inevitable, it satisfies the \nmultidimensional religious needs of the people, satisfies democracy, freedom in religious \nchoice. Most of the emerging religious phenomena in Vietnam (in recent years) have \ntended to be extremist, posing major challenges to: (1) spiritual security (pathological \nbeliefs, rebellious mentally, morally,...); (2) economic security (enticing, seducing, \nintimidating believers to surrender their assets, money, neglect of production, business, \nlabor, study); (3) religious security (competition with traditional/old religions, disrupting \nreligious harmony); (4) social security (abuse of health, life, dignity, culture, customs, \npractices ...); (5) national security (propaganda against the Communist Party and State of \nVietnam, inciting demonstrations, riots, subversion). \n3.2.4 Issues of land and worship facilities of religion \nIn the past two decades, the issue of religious land in Vietnam has been quite complicated. \nReligious "hot spots" that cause social disorder are all related to religious land. Lawsuits, \ncomplaints and disputes related to religious land also account for a large proportion of \nreligious lawsuits. According to incomplete statistics of the Department of Social Security \n(Ministry of Public Security), in 54 provinces and cities directly under the Central \nGovernment (over the past 2 decades), there have been over 2,000 land lawsuits involving \nreligion (mainly reclaiming land previously borrowed, confiscated, requisitioned and \nnationalized by the State from 1954 to 1975). Large numbers of people gathering that cause \npolitical insecurity and social disorder and unsafetyness (in many areas) account for a large \nproportion of religious "hot spots". According to the statistics of the Government \nCommittee for Religious Affairs, as of 2019, only 4 religions (Catholicism, Buddhism, \nProtestantism, Cao Dai) had a total of 723 lawsuits and disputes over religious land \n(Catholics - 430 cases, Buddhism - 196 cases, Cao Dai - 65 cases, Protestants - 32 cases) \n[The project "Surveying the real situation of the land, worship facilities of religious \norganizations in Vietnam today, solutions and recommendations, 2019" (Government \nCommittee for Religious Affairs)]. \nFormerly individual belivers who filed a lawsuit against the authorities is now a \nreligious official. They took the signatures of the people, mobilized a large number of \nfollowers to gather, protest, sabotage public assets, against law enforcement forces, arrest \nofficials, smash public agencies and headquarters, block traffic. When the authorities have \nnot resolved the matter, they called for the support of international organizations and expats \nthrought social nets. A number of lawsuits have brought the issue of religious land in \nE3S Web of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n6\n', 'combination with the struggle for freedom, democracy, and the abolition of the Communist \nParty. The land issues have been transformed into socio-political issues. \nIn Vietnam, religious land is granted by the State (without collecting land use fees). \nAfter 1975, a series of religious facilities (previously granted) were subjects to "socialist \nreform", so the government took over, confiscated and requisitioned them. Some of  \nreligious land have been used for socio-economic development and national defense \npurposes. Some were encroached by the surrounding people. \nAccording to Vietnamese law, religious land is granted by the State (without collecting \nland use fees), so religious organizations will not be allowed to transfer, donate, mortgage \nor trade. If they violate, they will be revoked. Religious land will not be compensated when \nthe State revokes for national defense, security, socio-economic development purposes and \nnational  interests [Land Law No. 45/2013 / QH13, Articles 63, 64]. However, at present, \nreligious organizations and individuals still transfer and trade religious land (in many \nforms) that are not controlled by the State and cannot be revoked. When  reclaiming \nreligious land for use in socio-economic development and national interests, the State still \nhas to compensate in the form of replacing it with another land (usually wider). Religious \norganizations often make it difficult for land revoking by refusing to return,asking the State \nto compensate as required. \nTable 1. The percentage of believers, the number of places of worship and the area of religious land \nowned (in some big cities) shows the irrationality and disparity in land fund for religion among cities. \nCities Believers Places of worship Religious land in use \nHa Noi 843,282 1,664 426.6 ha \nBac Ninh 132,813 632 170 ha \nHai Phong 403,000 739 292.9 ha \nNinh Binh 234,204 685 283.2 ha \nNam Đinh 623,800 1,505 2.332.7 ha \nNinh Thuan 254,000 217 78.67 ha \nNghe An 375,000 415 263.6 ha \nHo Chi Minh 3,956,685 2,157 357.8 ha \nCaption of the table 1: Report No. 379-BC/BDVTW, Summary of 10-year \nimplementation of Designation 1940/2008/CT-TTg of the Prime Minister on houses and \nland related to religion. \nTable 2.The increase in the number of places for worshipping of some typical religions in Vietnam \n(within 10 years from 2003 to 2013) shows the number of irrational increasing places of worship \namong religions. \nReligions Believers Places of worship \n 2003 2013 2003 2013 \nBuddhism 9.063.638 13.811.481 13.476 17.912 \nCatholic 5.512.287 6.623.481 5.860 7.445 \nProtestantism 582.438 932.326 226 599 \nCao Dai 811.903 1.086.349 907 1.265 \nHoa Hao 1.218.137 1.392.067 27 60 \nIslamic 65.597 77.275 75 80 \nCaption of the table 2: Report No. 379-BC/BDVTW, Summary of 10-year \nimplementation of Designation 1940/2008/CT-TTg of the Prime Minister on houses and \nland related to religion. \nThe following statistics on the number of religious worship facilities and the number of \neducational institutions in Vietnam also show the irrationality of the issue regarding \nreligious land. Currently, Vietnam has nearly 26 million religious believers but there are \n28,000 worshiping facilities. Meanwhile, Vietnam has nearly 24 million teenagers (ages 1E3S\nWeb of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n7\n', '15) but only has 2,402 preschools and primary schools (including people-founded and \nprivate schools) [https://danso.org/viet-nam/]. \nNowaday in Vietnam, the investment in building religious worship facilities for \nbusiness purposes and group interests is increasingly evident. Social networks in Vietnam \nuse the term "religious joint stock company" or "BOT temple”(Build-Operate-Transfer \nTemple) to name the recent pagoda constructions in Vietnam such as Bai Dinh pagoda, Ba \nVang pagoda, Tam Chuc pagoda... Believers and religious organizations build pagodas, \nholy temples, churches, statues, bells, and mugs that are more expensive. The construction \nof large-scale worshiping facilities compels individuals and religious organizations to call \nfor a huge source of money to socialize investment, using large quantities of precious and \nrare timber, gold and silver minerals. Meanwhile, in Vietnam people (in remote, \nmountainous areas) still live in poverty, homelessness, cramped house. Additionally \ntransport infrastructure, roads, bridges, schools, hospitals are still very modest.Monks took \nthe construction of worship facilities to show off their prestige, leading to disputes over the \nright to manage the worship facilities, causing religious disunity within the country, \nworsening the situation of religious security in Vietnam today.  \nIn general, the issue of land and religious worship facilities in Vietnam is a challenge \nfor religious security and national security. If the lawsuits are not resolved satisfactorily, it \nis easy to create "colour revolution" and "street revolutions" to overthrow the government \nas happened in some countries like Serbia (2000), Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004), \nKyrgyzstan (2005), Lebanon (2005), Kuwait (2005). The Vietnamese government should \nnot "ignore" and "overlook" a paradox: trillions VND are ready to invest in building \ntemples instead of investing in the construction of schools, hospitals, bridges and roads. \nVietnam is a secular country, the proportion of people with religion only accounts for 1/3 of \nthe population, but it boasts about many of the largest temples rather than the greatest \nbridges, the most modern railways and  highway or the most civilized university and \nhospital in the world. \nThe above paradox is the most recognizable manifestation of religious change in \nVietnam in recent years. That transformation signals a religious revival or a religious \nimpairment. This question related to religious security and national security is put out for \nboth the State and the Church and they need to answer. \n3.2.5 Social-oriented religious activities deeply penetrate the secular life and \nhidden many complex political - social issues \nCurrently, religious activities are transforming from "spiritual salvation" into "realistic \nrelief" with the motto "If society does not fulfill its duties to the community, then the \nChurch will join in and replace it". Religious organizations compete with private and state \norganizations in vocational activities, vocational training, medical treatment, detoxification, \nhumanitarian charity, social protection, nurturing orphans, caring for helpless elderly and \nHIV people,... to attract and bind followers. \nReligion developes economic, social activities to promote prestige. Appeared "religious \ncorporation", believers of the same religion will set up an association and do business \ntogether. People who follow the religion are satisfied not only their spiritual needs, but also \ntheir economic goals which is getting rich. \nReligions are preparing plan and conditions to propose to the Vietnamese government \nwhich will allow participation in social-professional activities such as charity, \nhumanitarian, social security, environmental protection, legal advice,... and public service \nactivities such as education - training, medical care, ... \n"Cross-border" missionary activities are performed online, via social networks, Internet, \nfacebook.

Nurturing and directing dissatisfied and disadvantaged \nforces in the country cause disturbance, create religious "hotspots" that destabilize political \nand economic  security, make people confused and reduce the prestige of the Communist \nParty, weakening the local governments, holding the masses of believers, gradually \nseparating them from the influence of local governments. \nTaking advantage of religious-ethnic issues to incite separatist and autonomous \nideology (typical in 3 regions: Central Highlands, Northwestern region, Southwest region), \ndestabilizing religious security, political security and national security. \nIn general, religious activities in Vietnam (after 1986 up to now) have moved out of \nworship and spiritual space, penetrating deeply into social life to strengthenbelief, \northodoxy and compete with other religions. In the process to penetrate deeply into social \nlife, religion inevitably wants to "replace" the secular value system, entice the masses, \nassert its orthodoxy, sometimes religions exploit hot issues of socio-political life such as \ncorruption,society\'s vices, mistakes in the economic and cultural policies of the State, to a \ncertain extent, they are social criticism the government needs to listen to. However, the \nGovernment should not "ignore" the reason behind religious politicization: the gap between \nrich and poor; human rights violation, social injustice; low-educated people, backwardness; \npoor social security; international political issues. \n4 Conclution \nBasically, religious security in Vietnam today is still under control. However, the threat of \nreligious security and national security in Vietnam can still occur with the above \n"scenarios". For a long time, Vietnam\'s resources to ensure national security have tended to \nbe allocated to political (regime), economic (production, national resources) issues. \nMeanwhile, the resources to ensure human and religious security are somewhat not \nadequate. In the current context, religious security needs to be expanded in many aspects: \nequality, human rights, democracy, corruption, poverty, housing, employment, epidemics, \nsocial prejudice, pollution of natural - social environment, crime,... Vietnam may have \nE3S Web of Conferences 258, 05007 (2021)\nUESF-2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202125805007\n9\n', 'different priorities in a series of security issues mentioned above, but in general, there \nshould be a general strategy and policy for the key issues such as poverty reduction, job \ncreation, equality of economic opportunities for people, social resources, human resources \nand natural resources for sustainable development. In the current context, religious security \ncan be achieved through strengthening democracy, human rights and harmonizing all \npeople\'s needs (including religious needs). Religion can be an external cause that \n"obscures" the basic causes of unequal treatment, mistakes and failures of State policies \nthat have caused conflicts in the name of protecting rights of religious freedom, but it is \nmore related to political rights, economic rights, and human rights than religious rights. \nReferences \n1.
