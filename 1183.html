Th\nfarm industry is the greatest singl\nuser of wood.\n"The farmer finds it harder an\nharder to get building lumber at res\nsonable cost. The reason is cleai\nFive-sixths of our virgin timber i\ngone. Two-thirds of all the statei\nwith 80 000,000 people and more tha\nfour-fifths of the farm values of th\ncountry,\' depend for timber on the fe1\nremaining states which still cot moi\nthan they consume. Within ten yeai\nthe entire country will have to depen\n"Moreover, what we can not suppl\nat home we\' can secure abroad. Fa\nmore than half the nations of th\nworld are dependent for timber sui\nplies upon forests beyond their ow\nboundaries. Even Mexico is an inr\nporter of timber, while the Canadian!\nif they should give us all they hav<\ncould meet our needs for less tha\none generation.\n"The demands we make upon or\nforests are gigantic. More than ha!\nof all the lumber used in the worl\nis consumed in the United State\nMeantime, we are replacing by growt\nonly one-fourth of what we cut, an\nour remaining supplies are dwindlin\nto an early end. It is clear that w\nmust grow what we need, or go wit!\nout.\n"The 460,000,000 acres of timlx\nland which remain, if they produce\nfifty cubic feet per acre per yea\ncould almost meet our present need\nRut they have been so mishandle\ntho* ir> cubic feet is all\'they gro\\\nwhile our population is increasing an\nthe uses of wood are multiplying. i\nhigher Standard of living alway\nmeans a larger use of wood.\n"The public forests, national an\nstate, are reasonably well handled, br\nthey furnish less than 3 per cent (\ncur lumber, and can never suppl\nmore than 20.\n"Farm woodlots, scattered in sma\ntracts outside the lumber regions, wi\nnlways help the farmers, but can n<\ngrow the vast quantities of saw tin\nber we must have to live. They are i\nlittle danger of devastation.\n"The nrivatelv-owned commercii\ntimber lands which contain most o\nwhat timber we have left are bein\ndevastated more rapidly and con\npletely than ever before, to the ii\ncalculable injury of the whole nation\n"When a house is on fire, the fin\nthing is to stop the fire. Replantini\nfire prevention, andthe saving of whr\ntimber lands still remain on the pub\nlie domain and Indian reservatior\nare each of great importance, but th\nfirst thing is to put an end to fores\ndevastation.\n"Since the states which do not hav\nforests must depend on those whic\ndo, this matter * must be handled b\nthe nation itself. A national la\nwould become effective everywhere i\nonce, while if saving our commercu\nforests were left to the individui\nstates, it would undoubtedly be year\nbefore those states which have larg\nsupplies of saw timber would take at\ntion. By that time it might well b\ntoo late.\n"Meanwhile, it is well to remcmb*\nthat the forest is a crop to be grow\nfrom the soil, not a mine to be e>\nhousted and abandoned, as the luir\nbermen dA, and that the proposal t\ntake the U. S. Forest Service out c\nthe Department of Agriculture is i\nfact a proposal to check the progrei\nof forest preservation in America."\nMUCH MONEY\nP FOR VETERANS\na Washington, Jan. 30.?The indem\npendent offices appropriation bill\n1- carrying a total of $494,304,238, most\nf- of which is for use by the ^veterans\'\ni- bureau, was passed today by the\n;d house and sent to the senate. For\nn the bureau the bill appropriated\ni- $377,474,622 and the only chango in\nthis feature was the elimination of a\n?t provision which would have limited\nthe number of camps at which trainK\ning schools might be established to\ne Camp Sherman, Ohio.\nn Some of the items making up the |\nn $100,000,000 appropriations for the\n^ shipping board came in for sharp\nd attack, the house defeating, 171 to\ne 117, Democratic motion to recommit\n^ the bill for the pui*pose of restrict- (\nn ing the board\'s advertising expendi- (\ntures to $500,000. In addition to\ny $900,000 carried for advertising, the\n^ board has available $800,000, thus\ngiving it $1,700,000 for advertising. (\nThe motion to recommit, offered\nby Representative Byrnes (Demo1\ncrat) of South Carolina, a member o!\n\' the apropriations committee, would i\n^ have eliminated also a section pro- i\n^ viding for $50,000,000 for payment ,\nof claims.\nAn amendment by Representative \'\nByrn8 (Democrat) of Tennessee, diB\nrecting that not more than six offi- ,\ncers or employees of the board should\nreceive a salary in excess of $11,000\nwas adopted, as was an amendment\nn by Representative Walsh (Republi\'*\ncan) of Massachusetts, limiting such\nsalaries to $25,000.\nn Mr. Walsh also got through an |\ne amendment stipulating that no part\ny of the appropriation should be used\ne by the board for publication of its\ne own newspapers, bulletins or periodicals\nof any kind.\n;; TWOlllLLlON\n?

Washington, Jan. 80.?Lumber and\nie wood-using industries in the United\n>- States represent an investment of\nn $12,000,000 and employ approximately\ni- 1,000,000 people, being first among the\nnation\'s industries in the number of\nemployes and second in invested capn\nital and in the annual valu* of their\nproducts, according to an estimate re-.\n& cently made by Frederick J. Haskin,\n1\' the well known writer and economic\nd authority. Other students differ somes\'\nwhat in the arrangement of these esh\ntimates but no one doubts that, next to\nd agriculture, the lumber and wood-usg\ning groups most vitally influence our\ne national life. And sharing with agrii\nculture the fact that their products\nare heavy, bulky and of prime neces!r\nsity wherever men live, lumber and\nid the wood-using industries are absor,\nlutely dependent .upon the element of\ns. t.ransnortation as nffectiner the cost of\nd their products to consumers,\nv, Within the past few months there\nid has been a spontaneous and nation^\nwide demand for a reduction in\ns freight rates upontho products of tho\nsoil and for the other fundamental\nd requirements of the public, including\nit lumber and wood products. Lumber>f\nmen declare that the chief element in\n!y the cost of building materials is\nfreight. The nation is waiting to start\n1] upon a program of home building but\n11 iii many places builders declare that\n>t freight rates have enhanced material,,\ni- costs to prohibitive levels,\nn At a conference of shippers in\nWashington December 14, last, a general\ncommittee was appointed to present\nthe matter to the Interstate Comg\nmerce Commission and hearings bex_\nfore that tribunal are being held this\nweek in Washington.

Today\'s ruling marks wide\ndistinction between private and bonded\nwarehouses.\nJustice McKenna on this point said\nthat "mere ownership was not the\nequivalent" to possession and declared\nthat under the Volstead law,\n"there must be ownership, and possession\nin one\'s private dwelling, and\nthat character can not be assigned\nLo the bonded warehouses of the government."\nThe cases before the\ncourt did not, he said, have the effect\nof depriving those who held warehouse\ncertificates of their property\nwithout due process of law nod did it\namount, he added, to the taking of\nprivate property for public purposeo\nwithout just compensation.\nReferring to the contention that\ntho prohibition amendment and the\nVolstead act if applied to liquor\nmanufactured and lawfully acquired\nbefore the amendment and the law\nbecame effective would be void, as\ntaking from property its essential\nattributes of the right to use it, possess\nit and enjoy it. Justice -McKenna\nstated that the court was "not\ndisposed to trace the elements of the\ncontentions minutely, as they were\nall answered by the former decisions\nof the court in the national prohibition\ncases."\nReferring to that part of the law\nwhich permits one to use lawfully obtained\nliquor in his home, Justice\nMcKenna asserted that this right can\nnpt |hs construed to extend "to liqoura\nnot aor situated or tq put it mow\npointedly, ah intention to make all\nbonded warehouses of the country\noutbuildings of its dwellings."\nDeclaring he had been in disagreement\nwith 4he previous decision of\nthe court in holding that liquor in\nprivate houses could be lawfullj\nmoved by owners to their residence!\nfor consumption, Justice McReynoldf\nassorted that if the doctrine laic\ndown by the court in that caae waf\ngood, it would permit owners to withdraw\nliquor from bonded warehouses\nand he urged that unless the courl\ntook that view it should "frankly\'\nwithtdraw its former decision. Ir\nthe present cases liquor was entrusted\nto government warehouses as permitted\nby the statute he said, but th<\nowner "is denfyd the privilege of\ntaking it home because that warehouse\nis not contributory to his\ndwelling nor adjacent thereto nor ar\noutbuilding connected therewith."\nThe decision grew out of a consolidation\nof four cases, all brought\nagainst internal ."revenue collectors\ntoo compel them to permit the withdrawal\nof the liquor.
