Despite being well established, these gameplays tend to structure the games\nin terms of challenges to be fulfilled on an individual basis, or by thinking collectively but having tomicrocontrol several characters\nat the same time. From this observation, the paper presents a complementary gameplay in which the player is urged to face\ncollective challenges by designing character organizations. The basic idea is to make the player structure and control group of\ncharacters by defining organizational specifications (i.e., definitions of roles, collective strategies, and social norms). During the\ngame, commanded by the player, artificial agents are then instantiated to play the roles and to follow the strategies and norms as\ndefined in the organizational specification. To turn the idea into practice, the paper proposes an abstract architecture comprising\nthree components or layers. This architecture is materialized in a proof of concept prototype that combines the Minecraft game\nserver, JADE agent platform, and MOISE+ organizational model. Variations and possibilities are discussed and the proposal is\ncompared to related work in the literature.\n1. Introduction\nMuch of the fun involved in modern computer games is due\nto their extraordinary capacity of simulating aspects of our\nreality and/or imagination. In the diverse genres, such as first\nperson shooters games (e.g., Halo and Call of Duty), third\nperson action/adventure games (e.g., God of War and Tomb\nRaider), platformers (e.g., Super Mario Bros. and Sonic), twoplayer\nfighting/sports games (e.g., Fight Night Round and\nFIFA Soccer), racing games (e.g., Midnight Club and Need\nfor Speed), real-time strategy games (e.g., Age of Empires\nand Command &Conquer), open world/sandbox games (e.g.,\nMinecraft and The Sims), and massively multiplayer online\ngame (e.g., World of Warcraft and Star Wars Galaxies), we\ncan cite games in which the player gets the illusion of\nbeing immersed in a detailed and verisimilar virtual world.\nCommonly, in these simulated worlds the player assumes\nthe control of a character (his/hers avatar) and interacts\nwith diverse nonplayer characters (NPCs) or other playercontrolled\ncharacters (other players’ avatars in multiplayer\ngames). Then, he/she is confronted to a series of challenging\nsituations comprising missions to fulfill, rules to follow,\ndecisions to make, territories to explore or to conquer, and\nso forth. According to [1], the fun emerges from this when\nthe player succeeds to comprehend and to master the general\npatterns of action and interaction underlying the challenges\nfaced in the virtual world. In this sense, the more a game\nis capable of portraying aspects of the player’s experience\nas gradually learnable patterns, the greater the chance of it\npleasing its users.\nNotwithstanding the achievements of the modern game\ntechnology, especially concerning 3D animated graphics and\nsound effects that have produced games featuring highquality\nenjoyable virtual worlds, we observe that the aspects\nof control and interactivity between players’ avatars and\nNPCs (the gameplay) occur mainly on an individual and\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nInternational Journal of Computer Games Technology\nVolume 2015, Article ID 731031, 11 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/731031\n', '2 International Journal of Computer Games Technology\nnonscriptable basis. By this we mean that, in general, the\nplayer actively controls one avatar and interacts with the\nNPCs issuing proper commands. For example, in first person\nshooter games, the player assumes the identity of a soldier.\nThe mission can be to assault an enemy base leading a\nspecial troop. During the mission, the player does his best\nin controlling his avatar while the other soldiers of the\ntroop, which are NPCs, follow the movements by performing\npreprogrammed attack routines. The player neither sees nor\ndirectly commands the attack strategies used by his fellows;\nhe/she simply assumes that the routines codified on the\nNPCs by the game designer are effective in making the troop\nto accomplish the mission. Another example can be given\nin real-time strategy games. In this genre, the player also\ncommands troops in combat against enemies. The difference\nis that now the player constantly has to issue commands to\nmake the NPCs to behave in this or that way. The attack\nstrategy is enacted by the player which has to have great\ndexterity and multitask abilities to microcontrol all of them\nat the same time.\nWhat we miss in these and related examples from the\ndiverse genres of games is a gameplay more focused on\nthe collective rather than the individual character, more\nfocused on explicitly stated rather than microcontrolled\ncollective strategies, and more focused on player-defined\nor player-editable rather than preprogrammed nonaccessible\ncollective strategies. By these we mean a mode of control\nand interaction in which the player can be aware of the\ncollective and social aspects of the game by creating, seeing,\nor modifying the role hierarchy and team behavior of a\ncollection of characters at run-time. Take, for instance, the\ntroop command scenario. The game could feature one or\nmore basic strategies composed by a given number of soldiers\nin the troop, each soldier in a position, performing some role.\nOur idea is that the player canmodify this troop organization\nif desired. He could create new roles, designate a different\nnumber of soldiers to the roles, establish the group coordinate\nbehavior for assaulting the enemy’s base, and so forth. Having\ndone this organizational setup the player can concentrate\non performing the role of his choosing while indirectly\ncontrolling the others characters (NPCs) in his group. As\nanother example consider an open world/sandbox game, a\ngame in which the player is supposed to explore a territory,\nfind food, gather raw materials, build houses, villages, and so\nforth, all of this in collaboration with other avatars and/or\nNPCs. At first, the players could try all alone to explore the\nworld and do the needed tasks. As they meet one another,\nthey discover common needs and try intuitive ways of doing\njoint activity. After a while of experimentation, the players\npass to a phase in which they could try to structure the work\nby coming upwith collective plans or organizedways of doing\nthings. In the process, inevitably, they are led to reflect in\nchallenges such as: How do we organize ourselves to do the\njob? What roles should be played? How do we divide labor?\nHow do we coordinate? How many of us are necessary for a\ntask?\nWe believe that offering a gameplay experience where the\nplayers are encouraged to think about and practice with these\nissues is a valuable effort. We note that some genres, mainly\ncollective sports games (e.g., soccer and basket), naturally\nlead to a group structuring/planning mindset like the one we\nhave described. Actually, some games in this genre feature\ncontrols for the user to play the coach of the team, being able\nto choose from a list or to define his own team organization.\nHowever, by the genre’s own nature, the user is driven to wellknown\npredefined team configurations, consecrated by the\npractice. Sports games aside, the major opportunity we see\nis to turn the gameplay into a more encompassing learning\nexperience, something that can teach the player more than\njust individual skill patterns, something with the potential to\noffer other kinds of challenges to the players, challenges of\ncoordination, cooperation, and organization.\nMotivated by these observations, we have set a research\nproject in which the final aim is to develop what we call an\norganizational interface for computer games, or organizational\ngameplay for short. Our scope is computers games in which\nthe player gets immersed in a virtual world where the challenges\ninvolve the interaction with other characters to realize\njoint activities. The organizational gameplay we envision is\nintended to complement, not to replace, the existing gameplay.The\nidea is to provide to the player visual representations\nand editor facilities for character organizations. What we\ncall “character organizations” comprises two complementary\naspects: on the one hand, the specification of role hierarchies\nand joint activities plans for dividing and coordinating tasks\namong characters of a group, on the other, the instantiation\nof roles and plans at run-time for controlling NPCs on behalf\nof the player. With these we expect to offer to the players a\ngameplay experience similar to the ones previously described.\nOur approach takes advantage of recent developments\nin autonomous agents and multiagent systems technology\n[2, 3]. We note that the notion of an agent as a software\ncomponent exhibiting autonomy, social ability, reactivity, and\nproactiveness [4] is a suitable conceptualization for characters\nof computer games [5]. Accordingly, the whole virtual worlds\nrendered in computer games can be seen as multiagent\nsystems (MAS). Concerning the organizational gameplay, a\nkey feature of agent technology is the existence of modeling\nlanguages and run-time infrastructures for designing and\nimplementing organization centered MAS (OC-MAS) [6–8].\nOC-MAS is a class of MAS where the agents’ autonomy\nis regulated/controlled by means of explicit organizational\nstructures (e.g., role hierarchies, standard procedures, interactions\nprotocols, norms, etc.) imposed to the agents at run-\ntime to ensure coherent collective behavior towards common\ngoals. Ultimately, the idea is to import and adapt some of\nthe concepts, notations, and infrastructures from OC-MAS\nto bring about our view of character organizations.\nIn this paper, our aim is to present the core idea of\nthe organizational interface for computer games together\nwith the implementation of a proof of concept prototype.\nIn Section 2, we first introduce the basic concepts and\ndevelopments we are using from autonomous agents and\nMAS technology. Then, in Section 3, we describe our general\nproposal for the organizational gameplay, contrasting it with\nthe existing gameplay. After, in Section 4, we present and discuss\na first prototype implementation of the whole proposal\nwhich was done in the context of Minecraft, a popular open\n', 'International Journal of Computer Games Technology 3\nworld/sandbox multiplayer game. In Section 5, we compare\nour work with similar work found in the literature. In\nSection 6, we present our final considerations and future\nwork.\n2. Background\nAutonomous agents and multiagent systems have emerged\nin the broad area of Distributed Artificial Intelligence [9].\nIn the last years, with the growing perception that agents\nand MAS “offer a new and often more appropriate route\nto the development of complex systems, especially in open\nand dynamic environments” [3, page 204], these concepts\nwere incorporated by other research communities, notedly\nSoftware Engineering [10, 11].\n2.1. Autonomous Agents. The general idea of agent is perceived\nin virtually all areas of human knowledge where\nthe notions of individual, environment, and community do\nexist. From a Software Engineering viewpoint, agent can be\ndefined as a computer program (or software component)\nthat is design to perceive and act autonomously on a given\nenvironment. Here the distinguishing property is autonomy.\nAmong the possible meanings [12], we consider autonomy\nas the ability of deciding by itself when and how to act.\nThus, in principle, an autonomous agent should be capable\nof choosing by itself what to look at and what to do in its\nenvironment or of refusing to perform some action when\nasked, in order to accomplish some goals it was designed for.\nFurthermore, if an agent exerts its autonomy balancing\ngoal-directed and reactive behavior in an effective way it\ncan be called an intelligent agent [4]. Goal-directedness or\nproactiveness occurs when the agent takes the initiative of\nperceiving, deciding, and acting to fulfill predefined goals.\nReactivity, on the other hand, means deciding and acting\nsolely in response to perceived events in the environment.\nThis distinction has led to the development of two main\narchitectural styles known as deliberative agents (e.g., beliefdesire-intention\narchitectures) and reactive agents (e.g., sub-\nsumption architecture). In practice, autonomous intelligent\nagents usually are designed and implemented by mixing\nelements of these two architectural styles.\n2.2. Multiagent Systems. A fourth desirable characteristic is\nsocial ability. Agents with social ability can get together and\nperform tasks beyond the reach of any of them individually.\nA collection of socially able agents gives rise to a multiagent\nsystem (MAS).\nAs long as agents are autonomous and designed to\npursue particular goals, social ability implies more than\ninteraction by message exchange within the MAS. Agents\nwith conflicting agendas are expected to compete. Agents\nwith reconcilable agendas are supposed to negotiate and/or\ncooperate. In this way, a crucial point in the development\nof MAS is how to reconcile the autonomy of the agents\nwith interactions that lead to some desired global behavior,\nor, more broadly, “how to obtain from local design and\nprogramming, and from local actions, interests, and views,\nsome desirable and relatively predictable/stable emergent\nresult” [13].\nGiven this issue, some researchers have proposed to\ndivide the MAS approaches into two major classes: agent\ncentered MAS (AC-MAS) and organization centered MAS\n(OC-MAS) [14]. In AC-MAS, as the name suggests, the\ndevelopment efforts are focused on the design of the agents\n(bottom-up development). The aim is to come up with an\nagent architecture that enables not only a right balance\nbetween proactiveness and reactivity, but also between local\nagent goals and global MAS purpose. This kind of approach\nwas common in the early years of the agent and MAS\ntechnology and has its roots in attempts to mimic swarm\nbehavior observed in species like insects, birds, and so forth.\nIn the last decade, with the growing interest in the development\nof complex systems, especially in open and dynamical\nenvironments [3, 11], AC-MAS have been superseded by OCMAS.\nIn OC-MAS, human organizations are used as a proper\nmetaphor for engineering complex openMAS. Human organizations,\nwhose typical examples are corporations, clubs,\narmed forces, and so forth, are collectivities pursuing specific\ngoals and exhibiting formalized social structures [15, page\n26]. Goals are specific to the extent that they are explicit\nand clearly defined. Social structures are formalized in such\na way that patterns of structuring and behaving (such as\nroles, role relations, procedures, protocols, norms, etc.) are\nprecisely specified regardless of personal traits and relations\nof any individual person part of the organization. Thus, by\nconceiving anMAS as an organization, ormore generally, as a\nbigger system formed by several agent organizations, the basic\nidea is to promote “social order” in a top-down fashion. The\nidea is to have the agents’ actions and interactions governed\nby formalized “social structures,” defined and enforced by\nmechanisms outside the agents, in order to enable the MAS\nas a whole to fulfill its purpose.\nIn the context of complex open systems, AC-MAS are not\na good approach because they rely solely on the agent being\nspecially created to interact with the others in an orderly\nfashion. But this can not be assumed on an open system\nwhere the components can be heterogeneous and possibly\ncreated at different times by different stakeholders. On its\nturn, OC-MAS are a better fit in this case because the system\nis designed to have some components, apart from the agents,\nwhich instantiate the expected social order. At run-time any\nagent that enters the organization is supposed to abide by the\nformal rules, procedures, and structures underlying the agent\norganization. If not, they can be penalized or even expelled\nfrom the organization.\n2.3. Organizational Design. The design and implementation\nofOC-MAS rely on two technological developments.Thefirst\none is modeling languages for specifying agent organizations.\nThe other is feasible ways of translating the specifications into\nseparate components for controlling and coordinating the\nagents at run-time.\nRegarding modeling languages, there are various proposals\nin the literature [7, 14, 16, 17]. Commonly, they\n', '4 International Journal of Computer Games Technology\nprovide the designer with some modeling constructs and\nnotation for expressing patterns of structuring and behaving\nthat characterize an agent organization. Four basic kinds of\nmodeling constructs can be identified [18]. Firstly, there are\nconcepts to represent statical aspects of the internal structure\nof the agent organization. In almost all proposals this is\nthe primary modeling concern expressed in terms of roles,\nrelationships, and groups. An agent, to be part of the organization,\nshould play some available role (position) in a group.\nRoles define expectations with regard to the agent’s abilities\nand responsibilities. Relationships (like has-authority-over,\ncan-communicate-with, or depends-on) further refine general\nexpectations and define new constraints the role-playing\nagents should observe. Groups are clusters of roles or of roleplaying\nagents that serve to partition the organization into\nrelated areas.\nSecondly, there are modeling constructs to specify the\nfunctional behavior of agent organizations. Generally, the\nfunctional behavior is expressed in terms of goals, missions,\ntasks, and hierarchical plans. Goals are declarative representations\nof the units of work comprising the purpose of the\norganization. In some proposals, the goals are partitioned\ninto coherent subsets called missions; a posteriori, missions\nare assigned to roles. Tasks are operational descriptions of\nhow to achieve goals. Tasks can be individual, when in the\nreach of one agent playing a role, or collective, when their performance\nneeds the coordinated effort of several role-playing\nagents. Collective tasks are commonly scripted as collective\nprocedures in the form of hierarchical plans, that is, task\ndecompositions trees where the leaves represent individuals\ntasks, the internal nodes represent the composition of finergrained\ntasks to realize coarser-grained tasks, and the root\nrepresents a global task for achieving some major goal of the\norganization.\nA third basic category of modeling constructs is formed\nby concepts to depict the structural behavior of agent organizations.\nThe structural behavior concerns an orthogonal\nview of the realization of tasks and goals. Rather than\nhierarchically decomposing tasks into subtasks, the idea is\nto define interaction protocols and phase transition graphs to\nspecify how goals can be achieved over time. An interaction\nprotocol is a prescription of sequences of message exchange\namong roles to perform some task or achieve some goal.\nState transition graphs are state machines that break whole\nfunctioning of the organization into major phases (or scenes)\nand valid transitions between phases triggered by events.\nLastly, there are modeling constructs to further restrict,\nregulate, and interrelate internal structure (roles), structural\nbehavior (interactions), and functional behavior (procedures).\nHere, the basic notions are the concepts of norms and\nsanctions. Norms are the definition of permissions, obligations,\nprohibitions, and so forth. For instance, a norm statement\ncould be as follows: an agent playing a given role is obliged\nto fulfill an specific mission; to fulfill the mission, the agent is\nallowed to use a given hierarchical plan when in a given phase\nbut is prohibited to use it when in another phase. Sanctions\nare penalties imposed to the agents after the infringement of\nnorms.\n2.4. Platforms and Infrastructures. Regarding the implementation\nof agents and agent organizations, it can be done by\nmeans of agent platforms supplemented with organizational\ninfrastructures.\nBroadly, an agent platform is a computational environment\noffering several facilities for developing and running\nsoftware agents. It can provide the developer with skeletons\nfor programming reactive and deliberative agents, special\nprogramming languages for expressing the action-decision\nstrategy (means-ends analysis and practical reasoning) of the\nagents, and services for dynamical identification, localization,\nand transport of messages within an MAS. Presently, many\nof the platforms follow some of the standards proposed\nby the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA\n(http://www.fipa.org/)), an IEEE Computer Society organization\nthat promotes interoperability standards for agent-\nbased technology. As examples of agent platforms we cite\nJADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework [19]), Jason (Javabased\nAgentSpeak interpreter used with SACI for multiagent\ndistribution Over the Net [20]), and Madkit (MultiAgent\nDevelopment KIT [14]).\nPrimarily, agents platforms are supposed to provide tools\nfor developing plain agent-based applications. In the case of\nOC-MAS, the practice has been to combine them with organizational\ninfrastructures. An organizational infrastructure is\na software framework and/or run-time facilities for producing\nfully functional agent organizations from organizational\nspecifications. First the MAS designer specifies the desired\norganization by using an organizational modeling language\nsupported by the infrastructure. Then he submits the specification\nto the infrastructure which generates/instantiates spe-\ncial components for coordinating and controlling the agents\nat run-time; the subsystem formed by these components can\nbe called organization run-time environment. To become a\nmember of the organization, the agents will have to ask the\norganization run-time environment for a role to play and\ncommit themselves to the realization of the corresponding\nmissions, rights, and duties. As example of organizational\ninfrastructure we cite MOISE+ (Model of Organization for\nmultI-agent SystEms [17]), which can be used in combination\nwith Jason. Another example is Madkit, which is not only an\nagent platform but also an OC-MAS development kit based\non the concepts of Agents, Groups, and Roles (AGR model\n[14]).\n3. Organizational Gameplay\nAutonomous agents and MAS are convenient notions for\nconceptualizing characters and virtual worlds of computer\ngames. Player controlled characters are in essence avatars,\nagents whose autonomy and social ability are provided\nby human players. Nonplayer controlled characters (NPCs)\nare artificial agents; their autonomy and social ability are\nprovided by the artificial intelligence subsystem of the game\nengines. In this sense, the virtual world of a computer\ngame is a heterogeneous MAS. It comprises software agents\n(NPCs) and is open for human agents by means of avatars\n(Figure 1(a)).\n', 'International Journal of Computer Games Technology 5\nControls\nControls\nUser interface\nPlayer\n(human)\nUser interface\nPlayer\n(human)\nPC\nPC\nNPCs\nNPCs\nNPC\nVirtual world\nNPC\nAbbreviations\nPC: player character\nNPC: nonplayer character\n(a) Traditional gameplay\nAbbreviations\nPC: player character\nNPC: nonplayer character\nControlCoordinates\nControls\nControls\nUser interface\nPlayer\n(human)\nPC\nPC\nNPCs\nNPC\nNPC\nUser interfaceOrg.

Traditional Gameplay. Similarly to MAS, a major challenge\nin developing virtual worlds for computer games is\nhow to design coherent joint activity. We refer to games\nwhere characters are supposed to form groups with common\ninterests. A basic configuration is one avatar as leader and\nseveral NPCs as companions, as illustrated in Figure 1(a).\nUsually, the challenges the groups face are beyond the abilities\nof each character separately.Thus, to act as verisimilar groups,\nthe characters should coordinate their joint efforts.\nTraditionally, coordination is preprogrammed or microcontrolled.\nAs pointed out in Section 1, either the NPCs fol-\nlow routines defined by the designer, or the player continually\nsends them commands to act in this or that way. In both\n', '6 International Journal of Computer Games Technology\ncases, the player is not encouraged to think about the group\nas an explicitly organized collective. The player knows that\nthe NPCs should help him to achieve the missions but is\nunable to act as a real team leader in the sense of devising an\nexplicit collective plan to structure and coordinate the actions\nof the group. With this, the player misses the opportunity\nof focusing on the learning social, collective patterns, rather\nthan just individual skills.\nHere, we can make a parallel to AC-MAS and OC-MAS.\nNormally, the design and control in computer games occur\nin an agent centered basis. Avatars and NPCs, as agents, are\nprogrammed to locally react to events or conditions in the\ngame in such a way that a globally coherent behavior does\nemerge. Mostly, the design and control are not organization\ncentered. Avatars and NPCs are not designed to perceive,\nreason, and proactively act according to organization specifications\noutside the agents. As long as the computer game is\nsupposed to be open only to avatars, not to external artificial\nagents, and the player is not asked to reason about and control\nthe group of characters as explicitly organized collectivities,\nthe AC-MAS design is a reasonable choice. Otherwise, the\nOC-MAS approach presents itself as a more appropriate\nalternative.\n3.2. Proposed Gameplay. To complement the traditional\ngameplay, we argue for an organization centered mode of\ncoordination and control. The basic idea is to stimulate the\nplayer to think about the game as a series of challenges\nthat demand not only individual skills but also organized\ncollective work.The player is then asked to assume the leadership\nby devising formal social structures (i.e., role structures,\ncollective plans, etc.) for achieving definite objectives, what\ncould be done from scratch or by modifying and combining\npreexistent social structures. The intent is to enable the\ncoordination and control of NPCs by means of these playerdefined\nsocial structures. Clearly, our proposal is in essence\nthe very idea of OC-MAS design recasted as a gameplay\nexperience.\nIn Figure 1(b) we illustrate the proposed gameplay. Compared\nto Figure 1(a), the first significant enhancement is the\npossibility of the player to edit organizational specifications.\nThese are written in an special purpose visual language that\ncomprises some of the modeling constructs used in the\norganizational design of MAS. A second major enhancement\nconsists in turning the NPCs into agent-player characters\n(APCs). APCs are artificial agents instantiated by the players,\nas needed, to assume the control of characters on their behalf.\nAPCs should coordinate their joint efforts according to the\norganization specification defined by the player. Together,\navatars and APCs will form what we call character organizations,\nwhich replace the groups formed by avatars and NPCs\nin the traditional gameplay.\nNote that, by means of avatars, the player still can participate\nin the action on an individual basis. And, at the same\ntime, bymeans of character organizations, the player now has\nthe chance of reasoning and acting collectively without the\nneed of constantmicrocontrol. Lastly, also note that character\norganizations do not eliminate NPCs altogether. Some of the\nchallenges to be faced by characters organizations could be\nto defeat enemies programmed as NPCs, or even to compete\nwith other groups formed by avatars and NPCs.\n3.3. Main Building Blocks. The scheme of Figure 1(b) also\nconveys the general architectural pattern we put forward\nfor actually developing the proposed organization centered\ngameplay. It comprises threemajormodules or layers: a frontend\nmodule for specifying and managing character organiza-\ntions, a middle layer in which agents and organizations are\ninstantiated, and a back-end game server in which the virtual\nworld and characters are simulated.\nThe front-end module is part of the graphical player\ninterface. It is the module with which the player can view\nand edit the social structure of character organizations. As\nmentioned, this is supposed to occur by using a special visual\nlanguage. Depending on the game and desired level of detail,\nthe visual language can cover different ranges of modeling\nconcerns. At minimum, it can offer graphical notations for\nrepresenting role structures and hierarchical plans. With\nthis, the player can define how character groups should be\ncomposed, in terms of roles to be played, and how the groups\nshould proceed to face the challenges, in terms of collective\nplans involving the roles. A more comprehensive language\ncould go beyond roles and plans and provide additional\nnotations to express interaction protocols, transition graphs,\nnorms, and sanctions, virtually covering all the modeling\nconcerns discussed in Section 2.3. Obviously, the more rich\nthe language is, the more difficult it becomes to the player to\nproperly use it, and themore difficult it is to implement agents\nand agent organizations able to interpret it. Therefore, concerning\nthe visual language used in the front-end, a balance\namong expressiveness, usability, and implementability should\nbe struck. Moreover, to promote usability, we stress that\nthe game designer ought to provide the player with default\nsocial structures. By seeing, copying, and modifying these\npredefined specifications, the player is guided and invited to\nbuild his/her own specifications of character organizations.\nAfter specifying the social structure of a character organization,\nthe player should command the instantiation of\nagents to play the defined roles. Agents, and the necessary\norganization run-time environment, form an intermediate\nlayer between the player’s front-end and the actual simulation\nof the virtual world and characters. Here we identify themain\ntechnical challenges. Firstly, a platform for the development\nof agent-based games will be needed. Some game engines\nalready providemodules for agents; an alternative could be to\nadapt existing agent platforms to interact with the back-end\ngame server. Secondly, the available agentmodule or platform\nshould be augmented with an organizational infrastructure.\nAs discussed in Section 2.4, the organizational infrastructure\nis the element responsible for interpreting organizational\nspecifications and implementing the run-time environment\nfor coordinating and controlling agent organizations. Lastly,\nappropriate agents should be developed; agents that can\naccess the organization run-time environment, assume roles\nindicated by the player, and properly command characters on\nthe virtual world simulation.\n', 'International Journal of Computer Games Technology 7\nThe back-end game server represents the components\nresponsible for simulating the virtual world and characters\nof the game. According to the standard practice, these can\nbe implemented by means of game engines. Game engines\nare high-level platforms for game development [21]. They\nconsist of a collection of modules for easing the process of\ncreating 2D or 3D scenarios, simulating physical interactions,\nanimating characters, and even doting NPCs with some level\nof learning and intelligent behavior. For our purposes, we\nassume that some of the characters simulated on the game\nserver are controlled by external commands.These characters\nare not autonomous agents per se but surrogates (avatars) for\nthe game players. As long as we have stated that the human\nplayers will instantiate artificial agents outside the virtual\nworld to control characters within the virtual world, we can\nsee these agents also as game players. For this reason we have\nnamed their characters as agent-player characters (APCs).\n4. Proof of Concept\nFront-end, middle layer, and back-end can be instantiated in\nvarious ways. For game developers, an ideal scenario would\nbe to have an integrated game engine with which one could\ndevelop not only the virtual world but also agents, agent\norganizations, and the organizational front-end. As a proof\nof concept, we have implemented a prototype by combining\nthree separate pieces of software: Minecraft game server,\nJADE agent platform, and MOISE+ organizational model\n(Figure 2).\n4.1. Minecraft Game. Minecraft (https://minecraft.net/) is\nan open world/sandbox game. It features a 3D cube-based\nvirtual world divided into biomes such as deserts, jungles,\nand snowfields. Primarily, there is no specific goals for the\nplayers to accomplish, who are free to choose how to play.\nPlayers, controlling an avatar,maywander around the various\nterrains, break, and gather blocks of materials such as stones,\nores, water, and wood. Using these material blocks, they can\nbuild diverse structures like houses, buildings, roads, villages,\nand so forth. During the game, players encounter different\nNPCs called mobs. Mobs include animals (cows, pigs, and\nchickens, for instance), villagers (person-like characters), and\nhostile creatures (such as spiders, skeletons, and zombies).\nThe player may hunt the animals for food, negotiate materials\nand goods with villagers, and combat the creatures. In sum,\nthere are three basic game modes: survival, creative, and\nadventure. In survival mode, the player must look for natural\nresources in the environment to stay alive. These include\nmaterials to craft tools, weapons and shelters for protecting\nagainst creatures, and food to satiate hunger. In creative\nmode, the players are provided with plenty of resources to\nbuild anything they want. They can fly freely around the\nvirtual world, do not suffer damage, or feel hungry.The player\nis stimulated to pursue large building projects. In adventure\nmode, the players are supposed to explore custom worlds\ncreated by other players. The gameplay is similar to survival\nmode, with restrictions and adventures introduced by the\nplayers.\nWe have chosen Minecraft as the virtual world of our\nproof of concept prototype for three main reasons. First\nand foremost, it is an open world where the players are\nnaturally encouraged to propose challenges and build things\nof their own. This is in accordance with our view that the\ngameplay experience should actively help the player to reason\nabout useful behavioral patterns. Implementing the proposed\norganizational gameplay, we intend to expand this reasoning\ntowards collective endeavours. Second, Minecraft has multiplayer\nsupport by means of game servers. Players can run\ntheir own servers on a local area network configuration or use\nremote servers. In this way, the players join a virtual world via\na client interface, by which they issue commands to control\ntheir avatars. And this complies with our assumption that the\nsome characters on the game server should be controllable by\nexternal commands, the hook for attaching agents as external\nplayers of characters.\nLastly, Minecraft allows the creation of game modifications\n(mods). These can range from simple additions of\ntextures to large reformulations on the gameplay. By using\nthis feature, we have implemented a basic organizational\ninterface for Minecraft (Figure 2(b)). This interface enables\nthe player to view and edit specification of character organizations\nfollowing the MOISE+ organizational model. The\ninterface also allows the player to instantiate agents, running\non a container of the JADE platform, that are able to connect\nto a given Minecraft game server, join the virtual world of\nthe game, and play specific roles of the specified character\norganization (Figure 2(a)).\n4.2. JADEAgents. JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment framework\n[19]) is an open source agent platform that complies with\nFIPA specifications. It provides a run-time environment\nwhere agents can be executed, extensible class libraries for\ndeveloping agents, and run-time tools for monitoring and\nmanaging the platform.The run-time environment is divided\ninto containers.The containers may be instantiated in several\nhosts thus forming a distributed agent platform.\nJADE was chosen for matters of convenience. It is based\non Java, the same language in which Minecraft and MOISE+\nare implemented, and offers a rich and mature environment\nfor creating and running MAS applications. Using JADE, we\nhave developed an agent architecture based on a particular\nperceive-decide-act life cycle. On the one hand, each agent\nmust control an avatar on the Minecraft game server; on\nthe other, it ought to consult the organization run-time\nenvironment to coordinate with the other agents.With this in\nmind, we structured the agent architecture around two types\nof behavior, one responsible for maintaining the connection\nto the game server; this behavior, called w-behavior, enables\nthe agent to perceive, decide, and act on the virtual world.\nThe other, called o-behavior, enables the agent to query and\nupdate the organization state. By alternating o-behaviors\nand w-behaviors, the agents become organization controlled\nartificial collaborators.\n4.3. MOISE+ Organizations. O-behaviors take into account\nthe primitives of an organizational model. By organizational\n', '8 International Journal of Computer Games Technology\n(a) Minecraft virtual world: human player and four\nJADE agents following MOISE+ specification\n(b) MOISE+: organizational specification editor\nFigure 2: Proof of concept prototype based on Minecraft, JADE, and MOISE+.\nmodel we mean both the modeling language and the organizational\ninfrastructure used to specify and operational-\nize agent/character organizations. As mentioned, we adopt\nMOISE+ in our proof of concept prototype.\nIn MOISE+ (Model of Organization for multI-agent SystEms\n[17]), organizational specifications are divided into three\nparts called structural, functional, and deontic specifications.\nThe structural specification covers the statical aspects of the\ninternal structure of agent organization in terms of roles\nand groups definitions, and role-role, group-group, and rolegroup\nrelationships. The functional specification describes\nhow to achieve global goals related to the main purpose\nof an organization. This description is done by means of\nsocial schemes and missions. In essence, a social scheme is\na tree where the root is a global goal, the internal nodes\nrepresent subgoals, and the leaves stand for atomic goals\nthat are supposed to be done by individual agents. A node\ntogether with its children means a plan. The plan consists in\nachieving the goal related to the parent node by combining\nthe fulfillment of the goals related to the children. There are\nthree operators for combining goals into plans: the sequence\n(i.e., fulfilling all the children goals, one after another, in a\ngiven order), the choice (i.e., fulfilling one of the children\ngoals, chosen by the agents), and parallel (i.e., performing all\nthe children goals at the same time). Missions are coherent\nsets of goals that can be assigned to the same agent by\nmeans of one of its roles. This assignment is done in the\ndeontic specification. The deontic specification covers the\nnormative aspects of the organizational design. It consists\nin the definition of permissions and obligations connecting\nroles to missions. In this way, an agent that joins a MOISE+\norganization by assuming a given role must (or is permitted\nto) carry out all the goals forming the missions related to the\nrole by means of an obligation (or permission) relationship.\nAnd the achievement of missions by role playing agents is\nto be synchronized by instantiating and following the plans\nembedded in a given social scheme.\nIn Figure 2(b), a fragment of a social scheme for\nbuilding a house is shown. The global goal, or purpose\nof the organization, is then named Build House. For\nfulfilling this goal, the major plan is to divide the work\ninto three consecutive steps. First, do the groundwork\n(the subgoal Prep Ground); second, build the walls\n(subgoal Build Walls); and third, install the ceiling, door,\nand windows (subgoal Ceiling Door Windows). These\nsubgoals are further divided into atomic goals: Prep Ground\nis split in breaking the ground (BG-0) and putting the\nfloor (BG-0), done in sequence; Build Walls is broken\ndown in building four walls (BW-0, BW-1, BW-2, BW-3),\nin parallel; and Ceiling Door Windows consists in\nbuilding the ceiling (PC-0), putting a door (PD-0), and\nfour windows (PW-0, PW-1, PW-2, PW-3), all done\nin parallel. (In the editor, a goal enclosed by {} or ||\nrepresents the application of the sequence or parallel\noperator, resp.). These goals are gathered into missions,\nlike resource collection, stonework, and woodwork,\nand assigned to roles such as assistant, mason,\nand woodworker by means of obligations and permissions\n(not shown in Figure 2(b)).\nLastly, the complete specification is used to organize the\njoint work of the human player with four artificial agents in\nbuilding a house, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). The agents are\ninstantiated by the player and run on the JADE platform.\nAfter creation, by activating o-behaviors, they connect to the\nMOISE+ run-time environment, assume roles, and commit\nto missions in coordination with each other. Furthermore,\nby means of w-behaviors, they actualize their decisions as\ncharacter actions and interactions in the Minecraft virtual\nworld.\n4.4. Discussion. Far from a full-fledged system, we stress\nthat the present implementation is meant as a prototype\nfor showing the feasibility of the organizational gameplay\nproposed in this paper. In this sense, MOISE+ should be seen\nas a first approximation for a visual organizational language\nthat can be used by game players. We note that MOISE+ was\noriginally created as a general organizational language and\ninfrastructure to be used by OC-MAS designers. It was not\nintended to be used by nontechnical people. Therefore, it is\na rich language for organizational design that needs to be\nsimplified and dressed up with an appealing visual notation\nto promote usability.\nBesides MOISE+, other models [14, 22] can also be\nexplored. Specifically, we have chosenMOISE+ due to its covering\nof structural and functional modeling concerns and the\n', 'International Journal of Computer Games Technology 9\navailability of a well developed organizational infrastructure\nfor implementing agent organizations. Both [14, 22] support\nthe modeling of structural concerns in the form of groups\nand roles. But, different fromMOISE+, they emphasize interaction\nprotocols and/or interaction structures for describing\nthe dynamics of organizations. In a first moment, taking into\naccount usability, we have regarded the hierarchical plans of\nMOISE+ in the form of social schemes more appealing to the\nnontechnical user than interaction protocols based on scenes,\nstates, states transitions, or interactions sequences.\nInitially it was said that front-end,middle layer, and backend\ncan be instantiated in various ways. In the prototype,\nthe front-end is based on MOISE+ language, the middle\nlayer consists in JADE plus MOISE+ infrastructure, and the\nback-end is Minecraft game server. In this case, we have a\nmultiplayer distributed configuration where all the components\ncould run on different machines. This configuration\nalso poses a clear distinction between the game engine (i.e.,\nsoftware for developing the virtual world and characters)\nand the agent organization infrastructure (i.e., software for\ndeveloping agent players and agent organizations for the\ngame).We stress that having thismultiplayer distributed configuration\nwith game engine distinct from the organizational\ninfrastructure is not essential to our proposal. We think, and\nexpect, that game engines could be extended to integrate the\ndevelopment of games based on agents organizations and that\nsingle person games can also be approached organizationally.\nRegarding the agent players, we have designed fully\norganizational agents, or agents that guide their actions and\ninteractions solely by organizational specifications. We also\nthink that smarter agents could be created to balance not\nonly reactivity and proactiveness, but also individual and\norganizational goals.\n5. Related Work\nA major challenge faced by game designers is how to\nincorporate high-level concerns such as flexible and/or social\nbehaviors into the gaming experience. Usually, NPCs are\nprogrammed to react to environmental or other character\nconditions, instead of proactively pursuing explicit goals, be\nit alone or in collaboration with other characters. Hence, in\nmost cases, their actions do not look natural from the human\nplayer perception.\nIn an attempt to overcome this limitation some research\nwork have proposed the use of agent centered approaches\nto control characters. One of the first attempts to connect\nintelligent agents to games was Gamebots [23]. It provided an\ninfrastructure to allow the connection of any agent platform\nand the Unreal Tournament game. Gamebots was later used\nas the base for Pogamut [24], a Java middleware that enables\ncontrolling virtual agents (NPCs) in multiple environments\nprovided by game engines. Another noteworthy agent centeredwork\nis theGOAP architecture [25]. GOAP is a STRIPS-\nlike planning architecture specifically designed for real-time\ncontrol of autonomous character behavior in games. It is used\nin several commercial games such as F.E.A.R and Deus Ex:\nHuman Revolution.\nRegarding the use of organization centered MAS in game\ndesign, two relevant works are [26] and cOncienS [27]. In\n[26], the authors propose the use of agent organizations to\ncontrol the coordination and adaptation in the context of\nserious games. Their aim is to adapt the learning experience\nto the skill level of each trainee, while maintaining the game\nbelievable and immersive. cOncienS [27] is a research work\nbased on a larger project called ALIVE which defines an\norganizational framework to build service-oriented systems.\nIt presents a set of tools for game developers to model\nscenarios using social structures. Specifically, it provides a\nprogramming interface for coupling agents to game engines,\na tool for creating organization ontologies (specifications\nof agent organizations), and elements to describe character\nbehaviors based on norms, roles, and their enactment.\nIn comparison, our proposal differs from these earlier\nworks in a main aspect. Our research focuses on the use of\norganization technology as gaming interface or gameplay. That\nis, we propose the use of agent organizations not only as\na design and implementation technology for more realistic\nand challenging NPCs, but also as a form of interaction\nbetween human players and the virtual world, a form of\ninteraction that enables the user to explicitly perceive and\nreason about social/collective challenges rather than focusing\nonly on individual skills. In this sense, we see the above agent\ncentered and the organization approaches as complementary\nto ours (similarly to what happens with the traditional\ngameplay). In particular, we note that [26, 27] have explored\nthe OperA [22] model which focus on dialogical structures\nand interactions protocols for scripting the dynamical aspects\nof agent organizations. Here, we have proposed the use of\nMOISE+ [17] which offers an alternative view based on goal\ndecomposition tree for expressing collective behavior.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have argued for an organizational interface\nfor playing computer games as a enhancement to the existing\ngameplay. This organizational gameplay, as we call it, is\nbuilt upon agent technology, more specifically borrowing\nelements from organization centered multiagent systems.\nThe central idea is to enable game players to command\nmore than one character by defining specifications for the\nstructure and behavior of character organizations. At runtime,\nartificial agents are instantiated to control characters\nwithin such organizations on behalf of the player. To turn the\nidea into practice, we have proposed an abstract architecture\ncomprising three components or layers and implemented a\nproof of concept prototype around Minecraft, JADE, and\nMOISE+.\nThe major benefit of the proposed organizational gameplay\nis to offer the player a novel perspective of the collective\nchallenges faced while playing a game. In first person shooter\ngames, for example, instead of controlling one character and\nimplicitly assuming collaboration from the NPCs forming\na group, the player actually could see and modify how the\nNPCs are supposed to behave as a group. Or, in real-time\nstrategy games, instead of commanding a group of characters\n', "10 International Journal of Computer Games Technology\nby sending them frequentmicroinstructions, the player could\nplan ahead several strategies for different scenarios. Then,\nthese strategies would be followed autonomously by the\ncharacters without the need of constant intervention by the\nplayer. In case of things going wrong, the user could switch to\nthe traditional reactive mode of collective action. In sum, we\nbelieve that the importance of our proposal lies in providing\na framework with which game designers can delve into a little\nexplored area in computer games.\nMore than showing the technical feasibility of the proposal\nby using current technology, the implemented proto-\ntype has pointed us to further research work. First and foremost,\nwe are investigating aspects of expressiveness versus\nusability of visual languages for organizational specification.\nOn the one side, it is important to know what kinds of\ngame challenges can be approached by explicit organizations;\non the other, we want to know the complexity, from the\npoint of view of the player, of dealing with organizational\nspecifications. Regarding implementability, we noted that\nthere should be an individual actions repertoire from which\nto compose collective goal decomposition trees. Presently,\nbehavior trees (BT) are widely used to script the actions and\ninteraction of game characters [28]. Based on these, we are\ninvestigating an agent architecture that could interpret BT,\nand if BT can also be used to express social schemes in the\ncontext of agent organizations.\nFinally, as future work we plan to devise more effective\nways to integrate our ideas with existing game engines.\nAs we have pointed out in Section 1, we perceive a major\nopportunity to turn the gameplay into a more encompassing\nlearning experience. In this regard, we also plan to conduct\ncontrolled experiments to assess the effectiveness of our\nproposal in teaching the players lessons of coordination,\ncooperation, and/or organization.\nConflict of Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank UFMA and FAPEMA\n(Grants PPP-01368/11, BM-00457/12, BIC-03153/13, and BM01245/14)\nfor supporting this work.\nReferences\n[1] R.
