It proposed a two-stage control\nstrategy, aiming at simultaneous attack from a group of missiles at a static target. The first stage adopts a special distributed\nconsensus protocol in order for all missiles to asymptotically achieve a consensus of states. During the second stage, the\nlocal sightline control law allows the missiles to independently reach the target. The dynamic equation of the missile agent\nis normalised to a quasi-double-integrator model which is convenient for designing the consensus protocol. The proposed\nstrategy is suitable for missiles of different speeds that have been self-organised without air operations centres. Two convincing\nsimulation results are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.1 Introduction\nSince the last decade, the theories and technologies of multiagent\nsystems (MAS) have revolutionised the manner of\nmodern war. In real-time field situations, different platforms\nshould cooperatively achieve complicated missions\nand autonomously make decisions. In general, the overall\ncontrol objectives of MAS can be broken down into four\nnested levels of decreasing order of scope [1]: (i) mission\nmanagement; (ii) coordinated strategy; (iii) control of individual\nagent kinematics; and (iv) control of individual agent\ndynamics. These levels are not necessarily specified into distinct\nengineering practices. The martial application of MAS\nincludes task assignment [2], path planning [3], formation\nflight [4, 5] and cooperative deception [6].\nThe misgiving between the missiles and the defence systems\nserves as the major key to military development. As a\nresult, multi-missile systems (MMS) with new cooperative\nfighting manners, have progressed by following the MAS\nsteps. Within the common communication network, a group\nof well-organised and low-cost multiple missiles prove more\neffective than a single high-technology and high-cost missile.\nSeveral cooperative control methods [7–9] have been\nresearched in the scenario of target-defender-missile. Zhang\net al. [10] studied the cooperative interception of a moving\ntarget. Within the cooperative attack strategy, simultaneous\nattacks [11] are cost-effective and efficient.\nIt is well known that cooperative control of MAS is\noften associated with consensus issues. An early overview of\ninformation consensus within multivehicle cooperative control\ncan be found in [12]. In the last few years, constrained\nconsensus problems have been thoroughly investigated. The\nconstraints that have been studied include: input saturation\n[13–17], delay [18], convex constraints on an agent\nestimate [19], memory and computation constraints [20],\nfailure of the actuator or communication [10, 14] andIET Control Theory Appl., 2015, Vol. 9, Iss. 3, pp. 441–446\ndoi: 10.1049/iet-cta.2014.0361velocity unavailability [17, 21]. In addition to the constraint\nissues, the finite time consensus, which has been\naddressed through the sliding mode based control [22–24],\nis another important topic of study. Most works, including\nthose mentioned above, focus on agents with linear\ndynamics (such as the single-integrator and the doubleintegrator).\nIn reality, however, agents may be governed by\nmore complicated non-linear, intrinsic dynamics. Secondorder\nconsensus problems of MAS, with non-linear agents,\nhave recently been investigated in networks with fixed [25]\nor switching topologies [26, 27].\nThis paper studies the MMS cooperative control that aims\nat a simultaneous attack on a static target. Based on the\nimpact-time-control [28] law, Jeon et al. [11] derived a centralised\ncontrol law [26] with information of range-to-go and\ntimes-to-go, from all missiles. However, because the target is\nusually thousands kilometres away from the air operations\ncentre, centralised control may be unsuitable for strategic\nmissiles. To address this potential complication, we propose\na new distributed control strategy involving two stages. The\nfirst stage adopts a distributed consensus protocol to make\nall missile states achieve an asymptotically consensus. Under\nthe local sightline control law, missiles independently reach\nthe target in the second stage.\nDifferent from other general agents (such as unmanned\naerial vehicles and satellites), the missile studied in this\npaper has a constant speed value and can only adjust\nthe direction of the velocity. This means that the individual\nmissile is a special agent with non-linear dynam-\nics. By normalising its speed, the dynamic equation of\nthe missile agent is transformed into a quasi-doubleintegrator\nmodel. Upon this model, a special non-linear\nconsensus protocol is designed. As the element of speed\nis eliminated during normalisation, the distributed control\nstrategy has a flexibility to allow missiles of different\nspeeds.441\n© The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015\n', 'www.ietdl.orgThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows:\nSection 2 presents the special dynamic of the missile\nagent and the two-stage cooperative control strategy, while\nSection 3 presents and proves the distributed protocol. Two\nexamples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed\ncooperative control strategy in Section 4. To close,\nSection 5 draws some conclusions from the study.\n2 Problem formulation\nA scenario of cooperative attacks on a static target, by\nn missiles and from different directions and distances, is\ndepicted in Fig. 1. In engineering practice, we often decompose\nthe trajectory of missiles into motions on a longitudinal\nplane and a lateral plane, and design independent controllers.\nWhen the missile is close to a static target, it almost remains\nstagnant upon the lateral plane. Without loss of generality,\nwe assume all missiles are located and move in a same longitudinal\nplane, and ignore the collision that occurs among\nthe group of missiles.\n2.1 Classic sightline control method\nBefore presenting a detailed cooperative control framework,\nwe will first introduce the movement equations and the\nsightline control law of a single missile. Establish the XOY\ncoordinates shown in Fig. 2, where the origin is at the target,\nthe axis OX connects to the missile horizontally, and\nthe axis OY vertically points upward. The motion equation\nof the missile is[\nẋ(t)\nẏ(t)\n]\n=\n[\nvx(t)\nvy(t)\n]\n,\n[\nv̇x(t)\nv̇y(t)\n]\n=\n[\nax(t)\nay(t)\n]\n(1)\nwhere [x y]T is the position vector, [vx vy]T is the velocity\nvector and [ax ay]T is the acceleration vector. The distance\nscalar between the missile and the target is R = √\nx2 + y2.\nSince the acceleration vector is always perpendicular to\nthe velocity vector, the velocity scalar of the missile v =√\nv2\nx + v2\ny is a constant value. a is the acceleration scalar at\nax = a\nvx√\nv2\nx + v2\ny\n, ay = −a\nvy√\nv2\nx + v2\ny\n(2)\nTarget\n1Missile\n2Missile\n3Missile\nMissile n\nFig. 1 Cooperative attack on static target by MMS442\n© The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015missile\n( )O target\nR\nv\na\nX\nY\nx\ny\nql\nFig. 2 Relative movement between the missile and the target\nλ = ∠(x, y), θ = ∠(vx, vy) − π (3)\nwhere ∠(x, y) is defined as the anticlockwise angle from the\nOX axis to the vector [x y]T. From (1) and (2), we can see\nthat the real control input is a.\nAs the sensor assembled on the missile can only measure\nR, λ and θ , we often design controller based on another\nequation set\nṘ = −v cos(λ − θ) (4)\nλ̇ = v sin(λ − θ)/R (5)\nθ̇ = −a/v (6)\nCurrently, the most common control method in the engineering\npractice, is known as the sightline control method [29]\na = −kvλ̇ (7)\nwhere k ∈ [3, 6] is a constant proportional coefficient. We\ncan find that time-to-go (the time arriving at the target) is\ndetermined by only k .\n2.2 Two-stage cooperative control method\nSince the sightline control model, consisting of (4)–(6), has\nstrong non-linearity, it is difficult to directly design a cooperative\ncontrol law. Combining (7) with (5) and (6), we can\nobtain\nλ̇ − θ̇ = (1 − k)v sin(λ − θ)/R (8)\nIt is clear that the system of (4) and (8) is autonomous,\nand if k is fixed, the time to fly is determined by the initial\ncondition R(0)/v and λ(0) − θ(0).\nLet μ = λ − θ , r = R/v, and\nu = v sin(λ − θ)/R + a/v (9)\nthen, the system can be scaled to\nṙ = −cos μ\nμ̇ = u (10)\nwhere v is eliminated, and λ and θ are reduced to one\nvariable μ. Model (10) is much simpler compared with the\nequation set comprised of (4)–(6).\nFormula (10) is clearly analogous to the double-integrator\ndynamics [26]. This is the so-called quasi-double-integrator,\nand as a result, a two-stage cooperative control strategy can\nbe implemented. In the first stage, we adopt a distributed\nconsensus protocol to acquire u and make the states r andIET Control Theory Appl., 2015, Vol. 9, Iss. 3, pp. 441–446\ndoi: 10.1049/iet-cta.2014.0361\n', 'www.ietdl.orgμ, of all missiles, converge. The real control input, a, can\nbe calculated by (9). When the states of missiles are close\nenough, the second stage begins and the controller switches\nto the global sightline control law with the same k .\nIn the next section, we will propose a consensus protocol\nfor the MAS with identical agents described by (10) while\nignoring the physical interpretation.\n3 Consensus protocol\nConsider a group of n(n ≥ 2) missiles with non-linear\ndynamics, labelled as 1, 2, . . . , n. The motion of missile i\nis described by\nṙi = −cos μi\nμ̇i = ui (11)\nwhere ri ∈ \x04, μi ∈ \x04 and μi ∈ (−π , π ].\nThe target of non-linear consensus is to design the control\ninput ui, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, such that\nlim\nt→∞ |ri(t) − rj(t)| = 0 (12)\nlim\nt→∞ ‖μi(t)| − |μj(t)‖ = 0 or\nlim\nt→∞ | cos(μi(t)) − cos(μj(t))| = 0 (13)\nThe undirected graph of (11) is defined as G(t) = {V , E(t)},\nwhere V = {1, 2, . . . , n} is a set of missiles in the systems\nand E(t) = {(i, j) ∈ V × V : i ∼ j} is a set of edges, in which\nan edge contains an ordered pair of vertices and represents\nneighbouring relations (information exchange) between two\nmissiles. (i, j) ∈ E(t) and (j, i) ∈ E(t) if missile i and j\nare adjacent. Denote diagonal matrix diag{δ1, δ2, . . . , δn} as\ndiagn\ni=1{δi}, then the adjacency matrix A(t) = (aij(t))n×n and\nthe Laplacian matrix L(t) are defined as\naij(t) =\n{\n1, if (i, j) ∈ E(t)\n0, otherwise\nL(t) = diagn\ni=1\n{\nn∑\nj=1,j \t=i\naij(t)\n}\n− A(t)\n(14)\nThe eigenvalues of L(t) are denoted as λ1(L(t)) ≤\nλ2(L(t)) ≤ · · · ≤ λn(L(t)). Then, λ1(L(t)) = 0 with a corresponding\neigenvector 1 = [1 1 · · · 1]T ∈ \x04N×1. In addi-\ntion, λ2(L(t)) > 0 if G(t) is a connected graph [30].\nAssumption 1: There exists two communication states for\neach missile: resting and active. When missile i is resting, it\ndoes not exchange information with other missiles, that is,\naij = 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nAssumption 2: When t = 0, there exists m active missiles; if\nm ≥ 2, the sub-network Ga(t), including all active missiles,\nis connected.IET Control Theory Appl., 2015, Vol. 9, Iss. 3, pp. 441–446\ndoi: 10.1049/iet-cta.2014.0361Assumption 3: When missile i becomes active from the resting\nstate, it will connect with at least one already activated\nmissile.\nRemark 1: Assumptions 2 and 3 can guarantee that the\nactive sub-network Ga(t) is always connected.\nTheorem 1: If there are m(m ≥ 1) active ones in an n\nmissiles network, there exists\n0 = λ1(L(t)) = · · · = λn−m(L(t)) < λn−m+1(L(t))\n≤ · · · ≤ λn(L(t)) (15)\nProof: Without loss of generality, assume that missiles\n1, 2, . . . , m are all active. The Laplacian matrix of the active\nsub-network Ga(t) is denoted as La(t), such that\n0 = λ1(La(t)) < λ2(La(t)) ≤ · · · ≤ λn(La(t)) (16)\nand because\nL(t) =\n[\nLa(t) 0\n0 0\n]\n(17)\nthe conclusion (15) can be easily obtained. \x03\nIt is clear that cos μi is a non-linear function of μi. When\n|μi| is close to 0 or π , cos μi is insensitive to μi; but\nwhen |μi| is close to π/2, cos μi is too sensitive. To avoid\nthis undesired characteristic, we define two intervals: the\nexpected cooperative interval (μ, μ̄) and the active interval\n(\n\x06\nμ, \x07\nμ), which both satisfy 0 ≤ μ <\n\x06\nμ < π/4 <\n\x07\nμ < μ̄ ≤\nπ/2. We will use an indicator function σi(t) to describe\nwhether missile i is active at time t, which is defined as\n(see (18))\nwhere t− → t and t− < t (0 represents the resting state and\n1 represents the active state).\nIt is clear that there is a hysteresis in the indicator function\nfor the activation of resting missiles. This results in\nthe inactivity of a new missile until it has entered into the\nactive interval. This property to detain activity is crucial for\nthe protocol. It will be illustrated in the upcoming text.\nIf missile i is resting, the control input is specified as\nui =\n{\nsgn(μi) · ki(π/4 − |μi|), if |μi| ≤\n\x06\nμ\nsgn(μi) · ki(|μi| − π/4), if \x07\nμ ≤ |μi| ≤ π\n(19)\nwhere ki > 0 and sgn(μi) is the sign function defined as\nsgn(μi) =\n{−1, if μi < 0\n1, if μi ≥ 0\n(20)\nControl law (19) will make |μi| enter into the active interval\n(\n\x06\nμ, \x07\nμ).σi(t) =\n⎧⎪⎨\n⎪⎩\n0, if\n[\n(σi[t−] = 0) ∩ (|μi| /∈ (\n\x06\nμ, \x07\nμ))\n] ∪\n[\n(σi[t−] = 1) ∩ (|μi| /∈ (μ, μ̄))\n]\n1, if\n[\n(σi[t−] = 1) ∩ (|μi| ∈ (μ, μ̄))\n]\n∪ [\n(σi[t−] = 0) ∩ (|μi| ∈ (\n\x06\nμ, \x07\nμ))\n] (18)443\n© The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015\n', 'www.ietdl.orgIf missile i is active, the control input is specified as\nui = 1\nsin μi\n⎛\n⎝−ci\n∑\nj∈Ni(t)\n(ri − rj) + di\n∑\nj∈Ni(t)\n(cos μi − cos μj)\n⎞\n⎠\n(21)\nin which, Ni(t) is the neighbourhood of missile i at time t,\nci > 0 is a constant weight coefficient, and di > 0 is a variable\nweight coefficient in the form of a piecewise function\n(see (22))\ndi is a special potential function such that (1) di ≥ 1; (2)\ndi → +∞ as |μi| →\n\x06\nμ and (3) di → +∞ as |μi| → \x07\nμ.\nSo di can guarantee that μi stays in (μ, μ̄) and hence that\nmissile i keeps active.\nFor notational convenience, denote r = [r1 r2 · · · rn]T,\nu = [\nu1 u2 · · · un\n]T\n, ξ = [cos μ1 cos μ2 · · · cos μn]T,\nS = diagn\ni=1{sin μi}, C = diagn\ni=1{ci} and D = diagn\ni=1{di}.\nAccording to (14) and (21)\nu = S−1[−L(t)r + DL(t)ξ ] (23)\nAlso, an energy function for the MMS is defined as\nQ(r, ξ , C) = 1\n2\nn∑\ni=1\nci\n⎛\n⎝ ∑\nj∈Ni(t)\n(ri − rj)\n⎞\n⎠2\n+ 1\n4\nn∑\ni=1\n⎛\n⎝ ∑\nj∈Ni(t)\n(cos μi − cos μj)\n2\n⎞\n⎠ (24)\nTheorem 2: Consider a MMS of n missile with dynamics\n(11) steered by protocol (19) and (21).

At 100s, the variance of r and μ are 0.0074 and\n1.9621 × 10−4, respectively. From the value of energy function\nin Fig. 5, it can be found that Q̇(t) < 0 except these\nswitching points of G(t).\nExample 2: Consider the cooperative control problem of five\nmissiles whose dynamic equations have been normalised by\nthe speed values of themselves. Missiles are found on the\nlongitudinal plane at the initial positions (20, 25), (10, 20),\n(29, 15), (25, 27) and (20, 20).

These figures illustrate all missiles\nsimultaneously reaching their target.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, the cooperative control for simultaneous attack\nof MMS on a static target was investigated. A two-stage\ncooperative control strategy was proposed and it was proven\nthat, under the assumption of connected active sub-network,\nall missiles can arrive at the target simultaneously. The proposed\nmethod is suitable for MSS with missiles of different\nspeed values. In theory, the study presents a proven consensus\nprotocol for special non-linear missile agents that are\ngoverned by a quasi-double-integrator dynamics. For future\npotential applications, the study gives an easy-to-follow procedure\nfor engineers to digest and expand in the cooperative\nfighting field. Future studies will be conducted to investigate\nthe cooperative control when missiles suffer from different\nconstraints on overload or trajectory curvature.\n6 Acknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the National Nature Science\nFoundation of China (Nos. 61203081 and 61174079),\nDoctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China (No.\n20120142120091), Fundamental Research Funds for the\nCentral Universities of HUST (No. 2013054), and Precision\nManufacturing Technology and Equipment for Metal Parts\n(No. 2012DFG70640).\n7 References\n1 Dydek, Z.T., Annaswamy, A.M., Lavretsky, E.: ‘Adaptive configuration\ncontrol of multiple UAVs’, Control Eng.
