This is for the entire county,\nducting the pro rata share of Beat 5, oui* part of this is $120,103.00. The amount of\nthe proposed bond issue would be about $250,000 which would make us owe less\nthan one-tenth of the assessed valuation of the taxable property or one-thirtieth of\nits actual value.\nThe United States government will go fifty-fifty with Grenada County in the\n•onstruction of hard surfaced trunk line roads. \'If we issue bonds to the amount of\n$250,000 the government will give us a like amount and we would thus have half a\nmillion dollars for road building purposes.\nWe could continue to give you reason after reason—enough, in fact, to fill a\nlarge book—why Beats 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Grenada County should issue bonds for the\npurpose of grading, contracting and maintaining hard surfaced highways, but limited\nspace prohibits this and we feel sure, anyway, that the experience of the past winter\nand this spring convinces you that it is little less than folly to continue to put money\ninto roads that can be satisfactorily used only in the most favorable weather. We feel\nthat we but express the sentiment of every good citizen of the county when we say\nthat we would not go back to the old road system if we could; therefore it will in the\nend be a saving and a wise .economy to issue bonds to do permanent road construction.\nWe are convinced that you are going to vote with a vast majority of the far\nsighted, clear thinking and level headed taxpayers on June 2nd so that Grenada\n*_ County will have one of the best road systems in the State of Mississippi.\nYours for better highways,\nGRENADA COUNTY GOOD ROADS ASSOCIATION,\nOur bonds outstanding amount to $198,086.00 and we have\nAfter de\nP-^|in.iinimi»u» »»n» m m» iinmiinH»miiniHiuihniiiiiminnu.HiwHiuiHiumtimimniimiiiinniiiimiJ\nerlooks the Gulf and one can sit at\nalmost any window and see the "white\nleaps."

Blakeslee brought the Missis\nsippi Press Association to Gulfport\nthis year. He went to Hattiesburg\nlast year when the matter of the next\nmeeting place was practically tied out,\nbut Blakeslee turned the trick with all\nhis cards on the table. He has been\nuntiring in arranging for the Press\nmeet and is also one of the leading\nfactors in planning to take care of\nthe Mississippi Bankers Association\nwhich is to meet here the following\nweek.

The reader\nmay surmise as to how a country\neditor and his wife can put up at\nthe\' Great Southern. This was ar\nranged last year by Ed Blakeslee\nthrough an advertising proposition,\nwhich, however, serves to show the\nliberal spirit of the Great Southern\nHotel management and that they\nknow the force and pulling power of\nnewspaper space.\nSomebody has said that "this is a\ngreat place to live after you have\nmade something to live on." Per\nhaps that is true, yet we see folks\nworking and struggling here just as\nat other places. It is true that many\nof the well fixed in life own homes\nhere and live here only a part of\nthe year, some in the winter and\nothers in the summer. We saw the\nhandsome home our own liberal mind\ned and public spirited citizen, Mr.\nJ. T. Thomas, has rented for himself\nand family. It is beautifully located\nand said to be very elegant on the\ninterior. Mrs. L. L.

Henry of the\nClarion-Ledger owns a beautiful home\non west beach Gulfport and is al\nready here. The Colonel takes ad\nvantage of the fact that he is a sort\nretired journalist and his silvery\n{locks to say sweet and gracious\nthings to the ladies and the better\nlooking the woman the more effusive\nthe Colonel is in the use of his ad\njectives. He is a sort of privileged\ncharacter with the newspaper fra\nternity. There is hardly one in the\nstate who has attended more Press\nmeets and who takes a keener inter\nest in Press happenings.\nI was about to forget to say that\nit is raining here too. It has rained\nalmost every day since we arrived.\nToday, there was a downpour.
