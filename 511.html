Knowing that, Hoskins was not a fox farmer, and, remembering that in the past Hoskins, had made a trip to the Outside, Van, immediately got into his boat and, sought the District Attorney.

Ticket Agent, CALEB CORSER, Superintendent, JOB PRINTING, Promptly and Artistically Done, —At—, Bally Times Office, Drop In or Telephone Your Order, PLAN CONSERVE, NATURAL GAS, OF COUNTRY, WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.—As the na, tion’s supply of natural gas is very, limited and geologic studies and pros, pecting indicate that only a small part, of the United States will ever pro, duce it. the Bureau of Mines advises, users to make the most of it while, it lasts and to avoid waste. Its engi, neers say it may be saved in the fol, lowing ways:, Correct temperature should be main, tained by the aid of thermometers or, thermastats, as keeping a home too, hot is wasteful as well as injurious, to the health., Many families can save gas without, inconvenience by using fewer rooms, during cold weather., A cooking utensil should be ready to, be placed over the burner before it is, lighted, and the gas should be turned, off when cooking ends., When water has come to a boil the, fire should be turned down or the ves, sel moved to a smaller burner, and, just enough heat should be supplied to, keep the water boiling., Cooking utensils should be covered, whenever practicable., No more water should be heated, than is actually needed., The careless, wasteful use ot noi, water should be avoided and leaky, hot water faucets should be repaired., Gas lamps should be burned only, when actually needed., If gas is to he used in main heating, appliances, it should be burned only, under boilers or furnaces with cor, rectly designed burners, air ports and, heating surfaces., When water heaters are operated at, tention should be given the following, points:, Burners and mixers should be clean, and adjusted to give short blue, flames. If flames are long, so that, the inner pale blue parts are cooled by, impinging upon the heating surfaces,, the combustion is incomplete and ob, jectionable gases are produced., In instantaneous heaters the flames, should be as low as is consistent with, rapid service at the faucets. Pilot, lights may be yellow but should be, turned low so that they do not de, posit soot., Soot on heating surfaces will pre, vent. transfer of heat as will scale or, sediment inside of heating surfaces., The following suggestions are also, given by the Bureau of Mines to help, in efficient use of gas in cooking:, The burners should be clean and ad, justed to give short blue flames; yel, low flames deposit soot., If tips of flames are below the uten, sil, transfer of heat is not efficient., If the utensil is placed low on the, flames, so that it touches the pale, blue parts, poisonous gases are pro, duced. The best results are obtained, when the outer parts of the flames, touch the utensil and spread out, slightly. If the burners are more than, one and one-quarter inches below the, utensil the gas company should be, consulted about having them raised., It. is wasteful to allow the flames, I to licit up around the sides of the pot., The size of the fhfihes can always he, reduced partly hy closing the gas, cock., A solid lid between the flames and, the pot reduces the transfer of heat:, gas ranges should he equipped with, grid or skeleton tops and the flames, applied directly to the utensils., Flames should he protected from, side drafts., FOX RANCHERS OFFER REWARD, At the meeting of the board of, directors of the Southeastern Alaska, Blue Fox armers’ Association, held, at Petersburg recently, plans were, perfected for the payment of a re, ward of $1,000 to any person who, will furnish information leading to, the arrest and conviction of persons, stealing pelts or live foxes from any, island member of the association., This amount has been posted and, the offer is now in effect.

There, was a reason. Downing Street and, the British Foreign Office were com, pletely dumb., After the first session it was an, nounced that all of the members were, pledged to secrecy. But despite this, pledge there was a leak somewhere., The news of the conference trickled, out and it had a decidedly French, flavor, or an Italian flavor, or a Bel, gian flavor., After the second session the French, Premier, M. Poincare, and the Italian, Premier, M. Mussolini, received the, press and gave their views of the, conference., Bonar Law maintained his silence |, and newspaper men had to be satis-j, fied with a two-line communique an-1, noui.cing that the conference had met!, and adjourned, for the British view, point. The London newspapers were, forced to print French and Italian, views on the conference., As the conference proceeded the, •‘hush-hush" policy in Downing Street, became even more so. Inspector, Montgomery, of the Metropolitan po, lice, brusquely ordered newspapermen, to cease standing outside No. 10, Downing Street. “You pressmen have, had too much blooming liberty around, here,” the inspector said. Of course, he didn’t speak as the representative, of Bonar Law, but he seemed to be, exuding the words that higher offi, cials were thinking., The British press twitted Bonar, Law for his silence. To no avail. Then, the British press stormed and raged, because it had to accept British news, through French or Italian sources., To no avail. The editors swallowed, their pride and carried the best stories, of the conference under Paris date, lines and credited to French newspa, pers., Bonar Law has seen how the “hush, hush” policy works out, but apparent, ly he is still Scotch. There are no, signs of relenting and the barriers to, publicity are still up in Downing, Street., It remained for Senator Medill Mc, Cormick, of Illinois, to give the ex, clusive, the effete and the socially, correct of London a chance to gasp., Senator McCormick actually came, into the lobby of the exclusive Clar, Idge Hotel in evening dress, wearing, a roll collar and a derby hat. The, guests gasped. Horrors! And a Unit, ed States Senator. It isn’t done, that’s, all. But Senator McCormick did it., Convent Garden, the home of British, Grand Opera, has had its vicissitudes., Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, and other screen stars have performed, on the silver sheet there. The best, singers of the world have been heard, there. Society has lolled about the, boxes, all weighted down with dia, monds and jewels. Young bloods have, taken their brandy in the numerous, bars of Convent Garden and the fam, ous opera house has seen many, changes, but now comes the greatest, of them all. American burlesque, shows are going to bo produced in, Convent Garden. Strange to say, Brit, ish society will patronize these Ameri, can burlesque shows, too. They have, seen one and they liked it, now they, want more. They are going to be, satisfied., When European diplomats move, about their movements are always, regarded with suspicion. When three, American Ambassadors appeared in, London during the reparations con, ference the British press immediately, jumped to the conclusion that Amer, ica was going to participate. Ambas, sador Houghton and Ambassador |, Fletcher and Ambassador Harvey, were besieged with questioners. Fin, ally they were driven to confession., Ambassador Houghton announced that, he needed a new pair of trousers and, came all the way from Berlin to get, them, while Ambassador Fletcher an, nounced that he came all the way to, London to do his Christmas shopping., The Ambassadors spoke with all sin, cerity, but the British press was still, suspicious., Peggy Kurton, who has recently re, turned from theatrical triumphs in, America, has accomplished an unusual, feat. She was unengaged when Miss, Phyllis Titmus. star in Jack Buchan, an’s “Battling Butler,” was taken ill, forty-eight hours before the date of, the opening. Miss Kurton was asked, to take the role. In forty-eight hours, she learned a lengthy part, rehearsal, six songs and dances, and appeared on, the opening night and gave a finished, performance., MOVIE, Irvin S. Cobb in a new guise is dis, closed as the editor of “Pardon My, French,’’ the Messmore Kendall pro, duction starring Vivian Martin, which, comes to the Empress Theater to, night., Mr. Cobb is responsible for the final, version of the photoplay, which was, taken from a story by Edward Childs, Carpenter. The famous humorist has, seen to it that the titles are as funny, as the picture, which is a comedy of, the newly-rich and full of valuable sit, uations., Vivian Martin plays the role of an, actress who, out of a job, accepts a, position as maid to a Kansas million, aire whose money had come all of a, sudden, and whose wife had an itch to, be in Society—with a big S. Miss, \'Martin is one of the best-looking wom, en on the screen, and her capabilities, as a comedienne have been demon, strated many times, so that her many, admirers will wait for “Pardon My, French" with apreciation aforetime., A combination of Vivian Martin and :, Irvin Cobb certainly ought to be the, goods!, HUSK EXCITES, MOHAMMEDANS, TO RIOT INDIA, BANGALORE, India, Feb. 6.—Fric, tion between Hindu and Moslem com, munities has resulted in serious dis, turbances in Tiptur, in Mysore prov, ince, during recent weeks. Numerous, assaults have been reported, and on, several occasions the shops have had, to close their doors. Special police, forces have been called out, and now, have the situation well under control., The cause of these disturbances lies, in part in the differing attitudes of, Hindus and Mohammedans regarding, music. Hindu religious ceremonies, are usually accompanied by music. Mo, hammedans have no music at their, services, and are seriously disturbed, when interrupted by musical sounds., In 1882, the government permitted, I the reconstruction of a mosque within, the Hindu quarters, with the distinct, understanding that the Mohammedans, should on no account object to proces, sions with music passing in front, thereof. The Mohammedans now con, tend that since music was never, played before this mosque from 1882, to almost the present time, permis, sion should always be disallowed for, processions with music in that place., The Hindus, on the other hand, have, been asking since 1920 for permission, to take an image in procession in the, streets, absolutely without restric, tions. The government, after a pro, longed inquiry, decided to admit the, Hindue claim., The present trouble began at the, time of the Dusserah procession last, September. On this occasion the gov, ernment refused to grant a license, on, account of the excited feelings of both, communities and the influx of irre, sponsible crowds in the city. In the, following month, however, a proces, sion was allowed. Before the pro, cession occurred, the Mohammedans, left the mosque in a body as a pro, test, and the procession passed, quietly., This incident led to high feelings, between the two communities. Many, individual assaults occurred, and gen, eral apprehensions of a breach of the, peace were prevalent. On account of, threatened violence, the Hindu shops, were closed for two days. The district, magistrate was called and, with a, large police force reached the place in, time to prevent further disorder.

That war has been over some time., So has the only other war this country has, had with Great Britain. We have enjoyed, peaceful relations, strained just a bit at times,, superficially, and but once seriously, for 107, years., We had always regarded the Revolutionary, War as justified. American independence has, been one of the biggest successes in the book, of time. The British themselves have often, admitted it. They are good sports. They, even came to Philadelphia in 1870 and helped, us riotously to celebrate the trimming that, our patriotic sires gave their forbears a cen, tury before. The Fourth of July has been, regularly celebrated in London, in the Ameri, can colony, for decades, without any mobbing, of our embassy., On tins side, until these latter days, mere, was never any dispute as to the merits of the, struggle for independence. The few who, thought the action hasty migrated to Canada, a long time ago, their flight being accelerated, by their contemporaries, who even enacted, some rather harsh proscriptive measures it, took the best efforts of "Washington, Hamilton, and Jay lo prevent becoming a blot on our, early history., The effort to put Washington, Franklin, the, Adamses, Jefferson and a long list of the big, gest men that any country of like size ever, had living at any one time, in the role of rash, vouths, turning over a perfectly good (Govern, ment. is silly as it is unpatriotic. It must, especially amuse the British, who write of, their internal discords with the most amazing, frankness, regardless of which side triumphed,, to find the Anglo-maniaes so ready to commit, national stultification and repudiate the state, ments of the Declaration of Independence in, order to placate a British opinion which ex, ists onlv in their imagination., Mai. Boy Britton, who reviewed the work of, the “revisionists” which has wormed itself, into St. Louis and other Missouri textbooks,, has done a real service. Let publishers be noti, fied that .no matter how it may jar the sensi, tiveness of these lickspittles—as devoid of in, formation about the causes and the conduct, of the Revolutionary War as they are of Amer, ican patriotism—such passages as he points, out shall lie rewritten to conform to facts. No, coloring of history should be allowed, either, in the interest of chauvinism or of detraction, from the righteousness of the patriot cause., BIG BILL HAYWOOD TAKES COUNT, Haywood, the former T. AY. AY. leader in, the United States, is down and out in Russiia, because be failed in the management of a, colonv he had organized there to work out, his Utopian ideas. He thought a colonv, could be formed and operated in defiance of, the principles of what he calls “capitalism”—, the individual right to the enjoyment of the, fruits of individual ability, energy and thrift., The colony failed and its members are starv, ing. Havwood is despondent because even, his friends have turned against him, charging, that he has no administrative ability., The outcome is not in any way surprising., I. W. W. leaders, communists of all grades of, radicalism, and agitators in general are ex, cellent propagandists, but they are poor ad, ministrators. They have theories because they, have not had practice. They have plenty of, time to promulgate their theories because they, are not engaged in any practical work of a, constructive nature. They get way with much, of their propaganda because the \'practical, people of the world are too busy earning a, living and building up industry to answer, their fallacious arguments. But when they, are subjected to the test of experience, they, invariably fail to make good., Capitalism has its evils, but the remedy, will never be found in the destructive policies, of communism. Communism will succeed for, a short time—as long as it can feed upon the, fruits of capitalism*—but .when the savings of, people of thrift have been consumed, com, munism has nowhere to turn for a means of, livelihood., The outcome of the Haywood adventure, ought to be a lesson to the other communists, who still remain in America, but perhaps it, is too much to hope that they will learn any, thing by the experience of others. They must, themselves have a demonstration of the utter, fallacy of their theories. They will go on, agitating, and may have some few recruits, from among thoughtless youth not yet trained, in the school of experience. They will acquire, few adherents from among those who have, learned life by honest, diligent, useful, pro, ductive effort., THE PASTEUR CENTENNIAL, When the French nation can turn to a uni, versal and enthusiastic celebration of the cen, tennial of the birth of Louis Pasteur, there, is sound proof that the heart of France is, sound, and that the dangers of impending, war which sometimes scare have a strong op, position in the great mass of citizens of the, Republic., Not that Pasteur, that great scientific won, der, was a pacifist. He was a son of a sol, jdicr of Napoleon, and was ever proud that on, his father’s breast had been pinned the cross, of the Legion of Honor., But science constructs where war destroys., Instead of making millions miserable the, achievement of Pasteur have saved literal!\',\', millions of lives and have put the entire stand, ard of living of humanity on a higher plane., That is a large statement. But what farm o’, who today pasteurizes his milk will not grant, that the process has been responsible for the, saving of countless children from typhoid and, other diseases?, Tn the fields of chemistry and medicine, Pasteur went far, and some of his researches, still remained to be improved upon by scien, tists of a later generation. It was just 30, years ago that Raymond Poincare, then min, ister of education, brought together a great, throng to pay tribute to the master on his, [seventieth birthday. Now Poincare is premier, of France, and with the millions of his fellow, citizens he is active in making the Pasteur, I cmdermial a celebration which redounds to, the credit of France and of the scientific, ! world., i _____, AFTER SIX HUNDRED YEARS, The last British troops embarked from, southern Ireland and sailed for home. After, six hundred years the Irish people have the, chance to govern themselves after their own, fashion, and work out their destiny., There were tears and cheers as the trans, ports departed, tears and cheers that fused, passed sorrows itr future hopes. Dublin, shell, marked, but still proud, had forgiven and, wanted to forget. That spirit, had it. pre, vailed with leaders on both sides of the chan, nel at any one time, might have solved the, problem of Ireland centuries ago., Ireland is now a free1" state, in fact as well, as in name. It has sacrified something for its, freedom politically, as well as physically. Tt, has given up, for instance, that voice in the, affairs of the British Empire with which Irish, leaders in other years were wont to command, attention in the House of Commons. But Ire, land did not want to help govern the British, Empire; Ireland merely wanted to govern her, self. Tn that fact we find a key to human, nature, universal in its application., Tf Germany is threatened with starvation, after four years of peace, how did the Germans, manage to eat during four years of war?, New York’s health commissioner says mar, ried folks live longer than unmarried ones., They have to in order to catch up with ex, penses., Time was when Dublin would have counted, the departure of the last British uniform as, a great day for Ireland, but now it’s hardly, an incident., OFFICE CAT I, TRADE MARK, W ^, I, BY JUNIUS, COPYRIGHT 1921, BY EDGAR ALLAN MOtL, There is always something. 1£, you are riding on the traing just, about when you get to a place where, you think you are going, you see, something interesting, you pass a, string of box cars a mile long.

M. Bouton of the, Pittsburg station, in conjunction with, C. A. Boddie, E. C. Douglas and P. D., Fessler, of the Westinghouse Electric, & Manufacturing Company, at the bu, reau’s experimental mine in Bruceton,, Pa., They found that signals from K1JKA., a broadcasting station eighteen miles, from the mine, were recorded by a, receiver located inside the mine, and, that it was possible to send and re, ceive messages underground through, the strata. About 50 feet from the re, ceiving station in the mine was a six, inch bore hole from the surface, lined, with iron pipe and containing electric, light wires which extended through, out the mine. The presence of these, wires, the report of the engineers said,, evidently assisted greatly in the recep, tion, for when the receiving set was, carried to another part of the mine, removed from the wires the signals, were barely audible through 50 feet, of cover. The fact that the signals, were detected, however, even though, faintly, was taken as sufficient evi, dence by the engineers of transmis, sion through the ground and to encour, age further experimentation., "The present preliminary experi, ment,” said the report in conclusion,, “while unsuccessful in indicating any, practical method of using wireless, waves for underground communica, tion, nevertheless indicate clearly that, electromagnetis waves may be made, to travel through solid strata. The, absorption, or loss of intensity, with, distance, is very great for the short, wave lengths used in these experi, ments. Longer wave lengths are, known to suffer less absorption and, may possibly be found practically ef, fective under certain conditions., WINTERS AS COLD AS, EVER IN ST. LOUIS, ST. LOUIS, Feb. 6.—There is lit, tle change in the seasons year in, and year out, according to Montrose, W. Hayes, meteorologist of the St., Louis station of the Weather Bureau., Forecaster Hayes declared the fre, quent expression: “It doesn’t got as, cold as it used to; we don’t have, heavy snows any more,” possibly is, due to the fact that experiences of, childhood are more vivid., "The winters of our youth seemed, at that limb to be shot through with, zero temperatures and to abound in, heavy snows. In retrospect the, acuteness of memory remains or, fails in accuracy,” he continued., “We have winters that are colder, and summers that are hotter, but, though these do not work exactly in, cycles, they occur so rarely as not, to disturb the average. The winters, of 1884 to 1888 were very cold, colder, than usual and the memory that sup, ports the saying that winters now, are not what they were maybe is, of-the persons whose youth was in, that period., “But the fact remains that the, coldest winter in the memory of man, in the Middlewest was the winter of, 1917 and 1918.”, TAX ON SERVANTS, INCREASED 100 FOLD, VIENNA, Feb. 6. — Domestic ser, vants are highly prized in Vienna,, and there are no where near enough, to fill the demand.

Years passed and, the grandmother could not be found., Denver, San Francisco and Portland, were visited, all with the same result., iThe mother had vanished and the, rather, Harry Towler, was reported to, be traveling with a road show in the, western states. A month ago Mrs., Kearns returned to New York, and, Robert continued his search alone., A faint clue to his mother’s where, abouts was given him when he heard, that she had been divorced and bad, married a Seattle contractor named, Hutchinson. So far the couple have, not been found., Alaskans who may know of Mabel, Towler or Mabel Hutchinson, or the, father, Harry Towler, or the sister, Fern, are asked to communicate with, the boy at 21S Ninth Ave., Seattle., INCREASED NUMBER OF, DEATHS FROM ALCOHOL, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 6. — D, aths, from alcoholism, which reached the, lowest number in California in 1920,, after the Federal prohibition enforce, ment act had diminished the -\'ttpply, of liquor, are once more in the in, crease, according to figures given, out by L. E. Ross, of the bureau of, vital statistics of the California, State Boord of Health., The year 1920, in the belief of, Ross, marked the nadir of the liquor, traffic as well as the number of, deaths attributed to alcoholism. That, was because, Ross believed, the boot, leggers had not yet become organ, ized and there was little drink, legal, or illegal, obtainable. But since that, year, the figures indicate, thpro has, been a steady increase in the number, of alcoholism deaths until, for the, first eleven months of 1922, the total, reached 102., In 1917, said by Ross to have been, an average pre-Volstead year, there, were 240 deaths in the state from, alcoholism. The next year due to, the war-time regulation of liquor con, sumption, the number decreased to, 192 and in 1919 it fell to 86. From, the low point of 37 in 1920, there, has been a gradual increase to 69, in 1921. The 102 deaths for eleven, months of last year indicates, Ross, said, that there has been a more, successful evasion of the provisions, of the Volstead act., The State Board of Health has no, figures on the number of deaths due, to bad liquor, although in ten months, of 1922, there were six deaths from, 1 wood alcohol poisoning and three, from denatured alcohol., INVENTION PROMISES, SECRET AIR MESSAGES, STOCKHOLM, Pel). 6.—A remark, able machine which automatically, I turns radio telegrams into secret code, at the sending station, and trans, fers these messages into straight, text at the receiving station, has, been invented and is being tried out, in Sweden, thus signalling another, stride in the rapid advances made, in wireless communication., The new machine, called a crypto, graph, in receiving the message as, originally written by the sender and, enciphering it mechanically, elim, inates tlve human factor of the code, clerk, who is liable to error, and, avoids the delays which have been, costly annoyances under the old, systems. One of the purposes of, this machine is to make the message, undecipherable by those for whom, it was not originally meant if picked, up while in the air, thus helping, materially in the solution of the, crucial problem of secrecy for radio, messages., The cryptograph probably will he, installed at the netv high powered, radio station at Grimeton, near Goth, enburg, Sweden, designed for service, between Scandinavian countries and, America, which will be ready for, use before the end of the year., If you change your address, do not, notify the carrier . hoy—report your, new address to the office., MUCH RED TAPE, IN ENACTMENT, OF STATUTES, WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.—The Na, tional Capitol is such a great col, lecting place for statues, statuettes, and busts to the memory of many, people and events, that it might seem, to the visitor there must be a targe, number of persons who make it a, business to propose monuments. How, ever, to accomplish the erection any, where in the city of a new statue, is a hard job., There are reels and reels of red, tape to be cut, for legislation for, the benefit of this voteless commun, ity is not the easy matter of run, ning a program through an aider, men’s meeting. y requires much, thought and time on the part of, Senators and Congressmen on Capitol, Hill, and international complications, are introduced when it is the mem, ory of a foreign hero that would bo, thus preserved, for then the good, offices of the State Department must, be invoked., That is the task faced by the citi, zens of the Argentine Republic who, recently approved a plan to present, to the people of this nation a statue, commemorative of their liberator,, General Jose de San Martin, to be, placed in Washington in return for, a statue of George Washington pre, sented (o Buenos Aires., In such case, the high representa, tives of that country must make their, plea to Congress, through the Depart, ment of State, for permission to, erect the statue. The State D part, ment in transmitting the application, must wind the red tape strongly, about the plans, which must be com, plete to the minutest details., After the officials of that, depart, ment have the papers in hand so, long (hat the sponsors of tho move, ment begin to fear they have been, lost or permanently pigeon-holed,, they are sent to the Libernry Com, mittees of the Senate and House., When these committees have dis, cussed the proposition at length, it, is sent to the Fine Arts Commission, of the District of Columbia govern, ment, if it finds congressional favor., This latter government, it must be, remembered, is also a Federal in, stitution., If this commission approves of the, idea and the lines of the memorial,, it looks around for a suitable site., As the Federal Government owns, most of the odd corners about the, city, it can appropriate any suitable, site it pleases. This settled on, the, commission sends the plan beck to, the congressional committees to, frame a hill authorizing the statue., Congress may or may not pass the, bill, but if it does it must then go to, the President for signature, and even, thus late it may he rejected entire, ly. But if he signs the bill the work, of erecting the statue may ho for, ward., And so, by the time all his des, cendants have died and his memory, has been almost forgotten, the mem, orial to the hero is unveiled., Town Clerk’s Report for the Month, of January, 1923, RECEIPTS, Balance on hand, January 1,, 1923 $7,296.63, From License moneys quarter, ending December 31, 1922 35.00, From Delinquent taxes, costs,, penalty and interest. 108.74, Total .$7,440.37, EXPENDITURES, Election Expense. ....$ 8.05, Publishing and, Printing . 3.40, Sewer Repairs . 67.70, Ass. and Collection, Taxes . 29.80, C. & R.

Meantime, great pre, cautions were being taken to avoid, the introduction of the boll weevil., Production in Australia by white, labor is cheaper than in America, by black labor. There are also great, prospects for cotton grown on ir, rigated lands., These two Lancashire experts vis, ited every state in Australia, covered, 6,000 miles by road and rail, and de, clare that the climate and soil in, many districts are unsurpassed for, cotton growing anywhere in the, world., BILLS ORDERED PAID, The following bills were ordered, paid by the Common Council of the, Town of Cordova at their meeting, held Monday, February 5, 1923., Northern Drug Company .$ 2.50, J.

Corn, and a variety of, other similar products, must hence, forth he sold by actual weight, in, stead of by measure. Formerly deal, ers bought by weight and sold by, measure, and reaped an undue har, vest at the expense of the consumer., The new unit is the hundred weight., The old standard was the quarter,, which varied in weight according to, the country of origin, making it vir, tually impossible for anyone not an, expert to know what the actual weight, was., Today the retailer is aggrieved, but, on the other hand the buyer is get, ting a square deal. The term “corn”, in the new law includes wheat, bar, ley, oats, maize, dried peas, dried, beans, linseed, and potatoes, as well, as the seed of grass, clover, vetches,, turnips, cabbages and beets., The Beast—“You used to say, there was something about mo you, liked.”, Beauty—“Yes, but you’ve spent it, all now.”, Amosh Tash says enjoy what, you’ve at the moment and you’ll find, almost every moment being some, thing enjoyable., / Delicious, J, Hams and Bacon, HAM AND EGGS, SDNDAY MORNING, A man looks forward to Sunday morning for it brings, him time to enjoy bis home and his family and a good, breakfast., Give him a slice of FRYE’S DELICIOUS HAM just, crisped on the edges, a couple of eggs fried in the ham, fat, a plate of toast and hot coffee., Keep a whole DELICIOUS HAM hanging in the, cooler if your family is large, or buy it sliced to your taste, at your dealers., FRYE’S DELICIOUS SACON produced, like FRYE’S, DELICIOUS HAM, from choice young corn-fed porkers, and, cured “The Government Way” has a flavor that words, will hardly describe.

Indeed, the condition of un, stability is the earth’s normal one, and man long suffered in conse, quence. To say then that what man, kind has characterized as a phenom, enon which is as sure and as inevit, able as an eclips# of the sun, might, be eluded finally, seems almost an, impossibility. Yet such thorough\', studies of the nature of quakes and, their occurrence have been made in, recent years that in future years, con, struction of great buildings, dams,, and even cities, may be affected by, recent discoveries in geology., Earthquakes are a natural occur, rence in certain regions where the, mountains are alive, Caranegie offi, j cials declare. There are districts,, like the Atlantic Coast, where the, mountains are dead, but around the, Pacific and in a great belt which, reaches across Asia and the Mediter, ranean, the mountains still are grow, ing. In their growth large masses, comprising many thousand cubic, miles of rock are pressed against, each other, but are held by friction, until the strain becomes too great., Then they slip and what is called an, earthquake occurs. This is the mod, ern theory of earthquakes. It has, been developed through prolonged, studies and demonstrated by obser, vations of many minor quakes and, of the lines along which they occur., The earthquake plane is often spok, en of as a fracture but it is really, not a break, a recent statement of, the institution declares. It is the, surface between great masses which, never have been united, but which, for ages have been slipping past each, other; and where this plane comes, to the surface of the earth there is, a line called an earthquake rift. The, greatest of these rifts in the United, States, so far as know, extends along, the coast ranges of California for a, distance of six hundred miles. It, passes just west of San Francisco, to, the east of Los Angeles, and disap, pears in the Gulf of California, Along, the San Andreas rift, as it is called,, earth shocks have occurred at dif, ferent sections., South of that stretch for some 300, miles there has been no movement, since 1857 when a severe shock oc, curred, the mark of which may still, be traced across the desert plains, like an irrigation ditch. Still furth, er south there have been several, recent shocks, but none of great, violence, although there is evidence, of considerable activity in the section, east and west of Los Angeles., For some years now, the Carnegie, Institute has been deep in the study, of earthquakes, and only recently, organized the advisory committee in, seismology, calling on the co-opera, tion of many other scientists to aid, in the research. Its activtles have, resulted in the discoverey of many, facts of practical importance to man, kind in this connection. The co-oper, ation of the United States Navy was, obtained in making a depth-measur, ing survey over a large area adjac, ent to the California coast, and while, the survey was made to find the, trend of earthquake rifts, it resulted, in Important data for marines and, map makers. Through the financial, assistance of the Carnegie Founda, tion of New York, Dr. Bailey Willis,, seismologist of Stanford University,, was sent by the institution to Chile, to study the effects of the recent, earthquake there and survey, the, aim being to arrive a; the probable, causes., It might be asked what value to, mankind will result from the expen, diture of great sums for the study, of a natural occurrence which, it is, admitted, can never be prevented and, which may continue to exact its toll, of human lives and property. In, view of the fact that scientists can, now locate the certain lines along, which quakes have occurred and, seem sure to occur again in future,, they are able to speak of live earth, quake rifts as they speak of live, volcanoes. It is known by the form, of the volcano or by the occurrence, of eruptions within historical time, that it is potentially or actually ac, tive, and much the same may be said, of the earthquake rifts., They are lines of special danger on, which no schoolhouse, skyscraper or, dam should be built. They should, be avoided, as far as possible, by, railroad lines, bridges, aqueducts and, other public works, and yet it hap, pens that they often run through, valleys where such works are sug, gested by the condition of the ground., As long as builders remair ignorant, of their position they run the risk of, inviting destruction, it was added;, but it is not difficult by proper, study to locate these lines of danger, on a map and to make the informa, tion public for the benefit of en, gineers and others. Indeed, there is, now being being published an earth, quake rift map of the state of Cali, fornia, showing the lines of active, rifts and also of aults that are sup, posed to be inactive, as a result of, the work carried on in co-operation, with the institution’s advisory com, mittee., That is how the engineers who laid, out the new water supply line for, San Francisco were able to remove, it from the former line which fol, lowed an active rift for miles, and, locate it along a mountain range,, where, if it moves at all, will move, as a block and not become dislo, cated or destroyed., MUNICH’S POOR AIDED, BY LOCAL ARISTOCRATS, MUNICH, Feb. 6. — Eight million, marks have been realized at an auc, tion here of jewels and gold and sil, ver articles which Prince and Prin, cess Konrad assembled for the benefit, of Munich’s needy. Many of the con, tributions were heirlooms and other, family treasures., Members of Bavaria\'s old aristoc, racy were liberal in opening up their, hearts and coffers. Prince Konrad, and wife themselves donated articles, which sold for 860,000 marks. A bou, quet of diamonds and pearls set in, gold, contributed by Princess Leinin, gen, brought 2,600,000 marks, the, highest bid of the auction. A piece, of jewelry from one of ex-King Lud, wig’s daughter went for 230,000.

It is, however, a most, extraordinary occurence for a man,, who is apparently in the full pos, session of his faculties, and who has, no suicidal intentions, to know that, before the dawn of another day he, will have passed into the Great, Beyond., Recently B. C. Ashcroft, editor of, the Monroe (N. C.) Enquirier, passed, away. After his death there was, found on his desk a farewell editor, ial which was written on his last, day in the office when he knew that, he would never report for duty, again, and that death just around, the corner., In his farewell editorial Mr. Ash, croft expressed his individual views, and feelings about some things, but, his attitude toward the public which, he had tried faithfully to serve, is, not so different from that of thou, sands of other publishers of weekly, newspapers. With that as a reason, we reprint the editorial in full •, “Many a time during .he years, gone by have I answered the call of, the man at the type-setting machine, or at the case for copy. This is my, last answer to that unstaying call—, copy., “The eyes o£ him who hangs the, copy on the hook will not, after it is, set, read the proof for they will be, death dimmed. The hand that wrote, it will not mark the errors on proof, sheet, for before it is set that hand, will be cold, numb and cunningless, in the grave., “The thought of laying aside my, pen—and that forever—is a stagger, ing one, hut there is no use to wince, nor cry alound, not a hit of it. Ahciu, the best thing to do is to be recon, ciled—and if I am not reconciled, what\'s the difference?, “Was your uncle reconciled when, he met death?” a long-faced ireadier, asked a boy whose uncle had died., “The boy replied, ‘Reconciled, h—1,, he had to be.’, “Now this contemplation of un, buckling the harness, of quitting the, work I love, is calculated to bring, on some sob stuff and it may be ‘hat, some of you like to read that kind of, stuff—hut I do not like to write it., “For many years I have written, copy for the Enquirer. T have told, of the successes of our people. I, have gladly told of their joys and it, has been a delight to me to chronicle, the fact for them the banner of suc, cess floated full mast and that for, them the bugle of vitcory was sound, ing sharp and clear. Sorrowfully I, have told of the griefs of our people., With a heavy heart and an unwill, ing hand I have told of death enter, ing the homes of our people, of uain,, sickness, suffering and loss coming, to the people whose servant I have, been in the way of furnishing them, with the local events, good or had,, cheering or sorrow-laden, in our com, munity., “X pass my pen to anotner nauu. i, wish I knew who will take my place, here in the Enquirer office.

The night has not been so, dark that there was not now and, then, between the clouds, the glim, mer of the star of hope., “My relations with the public, have been pleasant. The public is, not so good as the candidate for, office tells it that it is, neither is it, so absolutely bad as the defeated, candidate thinks it is, and taking it, year by year the public is pretty fair, in its dealing with the individual, at, least I have found it so., “I have mingled with our people, in public gatherings of about, all, kinds from preaching services to, street brawls—but the hought comes, street brawls—but the thought comes, where I will be one of the number, I will be the silent party at the gath, ering, and at that gathering, no mat, ter what is said or done, I will make, no objection, but I do hope that on, that occasion no self-appointed saint,, who claims to know all about that, other world and knows so little about, this world that he wearies part of its, inhabitants almost to death when he, speaks, will make an ass of himself, | by fulminating over me and airing, my many failures—a tiling lie di.l not, nave the nerve to do publicly while, I was in the land of tlie living.

A, campaign to raise $100,000 as a fund, from which 50 high school students, may be enabled each year, by money, scholarships, to complete courses, which otherwise would have to be, ended for lack of funds, is under, way here. So far as is known in, Providence, the project is the first, of its kind in the country., The system has made a good start,, seven children in 1921 being given, scholarships which allowed them to, remain in school, and in 1922, eleven, were so assisted., State Commissioner of Education, Walter E. Ranger, in speaking of the, plan said: "It promises to suj ply a, grave need at a weak place in public, education. While 96 per cent of the, public’s children from seven to four, teen years of age attend school, only, 60 per cent of those in their fifteenth, year, and forty per cent of those in, their sixteenth year, are enrolled in, school.

He succeeded Bish, op Frederick Eis, who resigned last, July at the age of 80 after serving, as bishop here for 23 years., Bishop Nussbaum was elevated to, the Episcopate in 1913 having been, consecrated bishop of the newly cre, ated see of Corpus Christ!, Texas., He laid the foundation for *he new, ecclesiastical unit and adopted a pol, icy of diocesan activities that brought, him recognition. As the result of, injuries sustained in a railroad, accident he was obliged to resign, his position in 1920.

No nation as such hasj, come forward to help them. Private j, relief organizations seem helpless to, cope with the entire problem. It is, too vast. Greece is face to face with, a social catastrophe. Internal order, and security are menaced by the, hordes of starving and distracted fu, gitives pouring into the country., Famine and disease are stalking, through Anatolia, Thrace and the, Aegean islands. Women and children, are dying everywhere. Even so great, and precious a thing as mother-love, cannot survive the agony and despair, wrought by the sudden breaking up, of familes and homes. At Samsoun,, on the Black Sea, mothers in their, desperation are abandoning their chil, dren and fleeing for their lives on, board any ship that will take them., The parentless children are left to the, merciful hands of American women re, lief workers. Their fathers have long, since been deported or killed., In Thrace, Greek soimers ana reiu-,, gees, maddened hy hunger, are rob-’, hing and sacking the countryside. Ini, Constantinople, a city ot a thousand, sorrows, pedestrians at night stumble, over the half-dead forms of children, huddled in doorways and alleys. To, day a caravan of dejected and exhaust, ed refugees from Anatolia swarmed up, the Grande Rue de Pera of the capi, tal like famished wolves. Fifty thous, and Turkish refugees, 45,000 Greeks, and Armenians, and 14,000 Russians ], fill the capital’s cup of misery to, overflowing., Typhus, smallpox, and dysentery are, devastating the refugee areas in, Thrace, Pireaus and Saloniki. In Ana-|, tolia, where the Greek army burned, I, sacked, and killed, there are 600,000, shelterless Turkish peasants, whose, plight is rendered doubly acute by, heavy snows and lack of clothing. In, the great storm of indignation follow, ing the Smyrna fire, they have been, forgotten. Many of them are inno, cent, law-abiding, home-loving tillers, of the soil, who deserve some meas, ure of the world’s sympathy., Correspondents who have traveled, throughout the affected territories re, port that unless foreign government, relief measures are undertaken, a ma, jority of the two million or more refu, gees will perish this winter. There is, | virtually no fuel, no shelter, no cloth, i jng. The relief work of the Athens, and Angora governments is pitifully, | inadequate.

I bought a new car, and made a trip over the border., Came back empty the first time.
