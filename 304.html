Their sons,\nsucceeding to the vast estates and ramified business interests, entered\nupon their responsibilities without training-, and the result wns that\nthe second generation had run through the original fortune that\nshould have been added to and enlarged without any material\nwaste. of brain tissue. The third generation, therefore, inherited a\nbankrupt business and receded to the foot of the ladder, where the\ngrandfather had begun climbing less than a short century before\nThis intelligent observation is recalled fon ihly by the announcement\nyesterday at the convention of the Ameriean Live Stock association,\nmeeting in Cheyenne, where a former secretary of the interior\ndelivered himself of the statement that the most amazing feature of\nthe packing house industry is the ignorance of the managers by\ninheritance, of the most ordinary economic principles. Never was a\ngreater or more concrete truth spoken. The huge packing interests\nof the nation have passed into the hands of the second and third\ngenerations, who never were called upon to delve into the repugnant\ndetails of their father\'s created industry. Phil. Armour, father of\nthe Chicago stockyards, was one of the most thorough-going disci\nplinarians, who realized the value of an intimate knowledge of the\nintricacies of the enormous industry lie was piling up as a monument\nto his name, and when his heir came out of college he was introduced\nto the business end of a cleaver and thence on by easy stages\nthrough the labyrinth of the business, ending in the laboratory,\nwhere the scientific side of the business, where high-browed chemists\nwere occupied in devising means of further utilizing the waste oi\nthe packing houses and corrals until it became synonymous with the\nindustry that nothing but the squeal of the hog escaped and that\nwas being canned for the phonograph, fiustavus Swift was the same\nprecise, hard-working student, of live stock. John and Michael\nCudahy were raised from the butcher\'s block, Nelson Morris began\nbuying a few heads of steers as a commission broker, Libby was a"\npractical butcher, and Sulzberger and Sehwarzchild grew up on the\ntop rail of the buyers\' corrals, and there was not one of them tha\' I\ncould not stand by while a drove of sheep or cattle was driven past\nand give so accurate an estimate of their value and the number of\nhead that an actual test demonstrated that none of these founders\nof the packing house business was $100 outside the real worth of\nthe herd or flock which they were asked to estimate. ) These men\nwere the giants of the business, but their descendant either did\nnot have the same incentive or opportunity to acquaint themselves\nwith details of the interests under their control and thus grew into\nan inheritance from which their costly and impractical college\neducation unfitted them. . .\nThis kidglove training may he held responsible for the gulf that\nhas developed to separate the cattle growers and the cattle- buyers.\nThere was something more than a friendly cordiality in the greeting\nof the founders of the business, for they knew every stockman from\nthe Panhandle or the Rio Neuces to the distant plains of Montana\nand Assiniboia. That the reader who is not deeply interested in\nthe live stock industry may comprehend the magnitude of the\nbusiness the Bonanza submits the following stateemnts, taken from\nthe official reports of the Chicago aggregation known as the\nBig Four:\nFirm Cross business 101G Profits 1910\nSwift : $575,000,000 $20,405,000\nArmour 525,000,000 20,100,000\nMorris 250,000,000 3.832,212\nCudahy 134,000,000 3,011,41\nGross sales of the Big Four for the year 1916 were aroun\n$1,494,000,000, or a gain of $217,838,000 over 1915. One of these\ncompanies\' earnings represents a profit of 127.74 per "cent on the\n$3,000,000 capital stock and H\',4 per cent on the capital investmen\nof $34,000,000. From these figures it will be seen that this is no\nboy\'s business, builded bv the brainy giants of the last quarter of\nthe nineteenth century.\nVOICE OF THE PEOPLE N\nHE \'Democratic press is priding itself on the assertion that\nevery paper in the state is against the change at the university\ndemanded by the new majority of tiie board of regents. While this\nis not the case, for there are numerous independent publications that\nktand with the regents, such a condition would be all the more\ndeplorable, since it would prove conclusively that the newspapers\nStanding for the old regime at the university are standing against\nthe interests of their readers, who constitute a majority of the\nelectors of Nevada. This is beyond peradventure, for the voting\nshows that a big majority of the people demanded a change insofar\nas placing the affairs of the university in the hands of another\npresident. If a majority of the people insist on the change and a\nmajority of the newspapers oppose the change, then the new regents\ncannot do better than stay with the masses who pay the taxes and\nwhose children look to the university for the higher education that\nshould not be denied them for the sake of perpetuating a political\ncontrol.\nA Carson City correspondent, writing of the legislative ball,\nstated that "The Carson belles were arrayed in their most dazzling\ngowns, but it, is but fair to remark that they had nothing on"\nWonder if the gay young bucks from the crudeness of the southern\ndeserts could stand this quintessence of refinement without blushing.\nSeriously, it seems as though the public morals committee should\ntake action.\nALLIES EARNESTLY\nSEEK FOR COPPER\nWANT THE RED METAL FOR\nDELIVERY IN LAST HALF\nOF 1917\nThe Boston News bureau says that\nfrom various sources it has been\nlearned that inquiries for large quan\ntities of copper, to be delivered to\nthe allies during the last half of\n1917, have made their appearance.\nEstimates on the tonnages required\nrange from half a billion to 600,000,-\n000 pounds.\nWithdrawal of offers to sell near-by\ncopper is considered very significant\nin the trade in view of recurrent re\nports that Great Britain is negotiating\nwith American producers for an\namount of copper greater than any\nheretofore purchased, \' is the state\nment under a New York date. There\nare whisperings in the trade that\nEngland, for account of herself and\nallies and Canadian munitions manu\nfacturers, is anxious to book copper\nfor delivery through the last six\nmonths of this year, and that con\nferences have already been held in\nthis city between bankers represent\ning Great Britain and representatives\nof big copper producers. Some re\nports place the price under discus\nsion at something like 27 cents a\npound. Representatives of the large\nsellers are inclined to reticence on\nthe subject. But they do state that\nthe allies, represented by Great Brit\nain, will have to come into this\nmarket in the near future and cover\ntheir copper requirements for the\nrest of 1917 whether the war ends or\nnot.\nFor the first time in many weeks\nLondon dealers are cabling sellers\nhere, offering as high as 2SM cents\na pound, freight alongside ship, for\nany January-February-March metal.\nThese offers have been declined.\nIt is estimated transactions in re\nsale on Tuesday aggregated 1,000,000\npounds at about 26 cents a young for\nMarch-April delivery.\nAlthough the market is quiet, some\nsellers have changed their attitude\nfollowing reports of negotiations for\nexport delivery.

Los Angeles Times.\nVALUE OF A PURCHASING. AGENT\n( OVERXOR BOYLE believes the state should have a purehasin\nVJ agent to look after the interests of the several departments,\nincluding the state university. This is a very grave matter\npresent to the legislature, as it is apt to confer arbitrary powers on\nsome individual who might not be morally strong enough to with\nstand the temptations thrown in his path. It is a conceded fact that\nthe university itself has never been popular with the merchants o\nReno for more than one reason, but the most cogent objection has\nbeen the practice of restricting purchases for that institution to one\nfirm that is known all over the state as having a virtual monopoly\nof the educational business. There is no reason why this should be\nso, but it is a fact that, while others have tried to break in,to the\npork barrel, none of them succeeded to an extent that threatened\nthem with sudden enrichment. There was an intangible something\nin their way that was more than superhuman strength could grapple\nwith. Therefore when proposals were opened the advertising failed\nto bring in new names or new firms, since all recognized the\nhopelessness of competing. A single change in the specifications\nwould invalidate the requirements so far as set forth in the bids for\nsupplies and left the buying agent at liberty to go wherever he\npleased, which generally was at t he same old place that had been\ngathering golden ducats from the public treasury for many years.\nThere was no hint of collusion or was there any evidence that\nulterior motives were at the bottom of the selection, but, all the\nsame, it was suspicious, to say the least. The utter futility of\ngetting away from this influence disheartened the Reno business men\nand they resigned themselves to the conviction that the money to\nwhich they contributed as Nevada taxpayers had a pretty strong\ncable attachment that pulled business in one direction only. It is\neven admitted that mail order and catalogue houses were patronized\nto the exclusion of Nevada firms, without giving the latter a chance\nto show what they were willing to do or to display samples of what\nthey had to offer.

Swing\ning from the report of the associa\ntion\'s market committee, presented\nyesterday, Interest at the annual con\nvention of the American National\nLivestock association turned -o the\nproposed increase in grazing fees on\nnational forests, given in the call for\n,he convention as one of the major\nsubjects to come up at this meeting.\nA p, potter, associate forester, of\nWashington, summarized the goverrf\nment bureau\'s plans and reasons for\nIncreased fees, and the resolutions\ncommittee passed a resolution pro\ntesting sharply against the increase.\nThis resolution declared that per\nmittees already are paying full value\nfor the grazing privileges they hold;\nthat the foes paid are one-third\ngreater than the cost of administer\ning the grazing operations; that the\nadvance in fees is a "complete re\nversal of policy, wiilcn we veiy nmr;i,\ndeplore," and that in the belief of!\nthe committee the reasons artvannxl (\nfor the proposed raise are Insuffi-,\nclent; therefore "we do mom vigor\nously and unanimously protest against\nany raise In the fees now charged for\ngrazing on the national forests."\nThe resolution was based on aliout\n100 protests, filed with the forest\nservice and grazing lands committee\nof the association.\nReviewing the history of grazing\nland leasing legislation and its failure\nto get through congress, Mr. Potter\nsaid: "When congress might have\npassed such a bill, the stockmen did\nnot want it, and when the stockmen\nconcluded they wanted It, congress\ncould not see It that way. Well, after\nthe funeral was over, up bobs the\nagitation: \'Why don\'t you raise the\ngrazing fees?\' and a perfectly good\nreaBon presented itself in the fact\nthat the election was coming on and\nthat It would not bo fair to injwt this\nthing into a political campaign. And\nso It went over for another session.\n"The only way a raise in fees\ncould affect the consumer would bo\nin our getting the price so high the\nranges would not be used, and In that\nway cause the supply of meat ani\nmals to be reduced." t\nDr. W. J. Butler, state veterinarian\nof Montana, discussing the "present\nand future of the livestock Industry,"\nsaid:\n"The United States now is raising\nthe best cattle In the world, and has\nthe best market facilities. I predict\nthat the raising of pure bred cattle,\nnow in Its Infancy, will become an\nImportant factor In the Industry."\nThe reimrt of the market com\nmittee centered around the success\nof the committee In obtaining consent\nof the packers to an investigation of\nthe meat Industry, under certain con\nditions. Formal announcement of success in\nan effort to bring about an agreement\nby the big packing concerns of the\ncountry to an Invent lent ion of the\npacking industry by the federal trade\ncommission was contained in the re\nport of the commission on markets of\nthe American National Livestock as\nsociation submitted at the annual con\nvention here by B. L. Burke of\nOmaha, vice chairman.\nThe market committee appointed a\nyear ago at El Paso has been en\ngaged in conducting a campaign for\na federal Investigation of the live\nstock Industry relating to production\nand distribution.\n"We have convinced the packing\ninterests that at last the producers\nare a factor to be reckoned with,"\nsays the report, "that they can or\nganize and stick together for the\naccomplishment of an end in which\nthey are vitally interested, namely,\nthe establishment of fair, open and\ncompetitive markets.\n"We have convinced them that we\nare Hot to be turned from our main\npurpose. As a result we have met\nthem both Individually and as a com\nmittee and they have finally agreed,\nunder certain conditions, to withdraw\ntheir opposition to an investigation\nby the federal trade commission."\nAfter emphasizing the magnitude of\nthe task which the committee under\ntook and detailing the methods by\nwhich an agreement was finally\nreached with the packers, the report\nrefers to what is termed the more\nfundamental features of questions\npertaining to the marketing of live\nstock and meats. These are:\nControl at central markets by the\npackers, which It Is declared Is as\ngreat as every but temporarily ob\nscured by the unprecedented demand\ncaused by the war; difficulty in mak\ning the public understand that by\nlaying foundations for Increased pro\nduction and more economical dis\ntribution the committee will aid In\nlowing the cost of living, co-operation\nwith packers, commission men, slock\nyards companies, and federal bureau.\nHe Wat 8hort.\nEarly one evening a frail little girl\nentered a candy store and asked for\na cuke of chocolate.

Kansas City Journal\nMalaria and tha Effact Productd\nPlanting a Blua Gum,\nDuring tbe latter decades of the nine\nteenth century it was a common prac\ntice to plant blue gum or eucalyptus\ntrees In districts infected by malarial\nfever. It was held that the essential\noil produced by tbe leaves combated\nthe harmful vapors rising from tbe\nswamps laden with the poison of tbe\ndisease. Tbe discovery that tbe ma\nlarial germ Is introduced into tbe blood\nby a mosquito has settled once and for\nall the origin of the disease.\nTbe theory that the eucalyptus tree\nneutralize! ttie poison vapors ll non-\nsense, yet the fact remains that where\nblue gums were freely planted there\nwas always a notable decline In tbe\namount of malaria.\nWhat Is the explanation of this cur\nenmstance? It has been demonstrated\nthat, of nearly all trees, the eucalyptus\nabsorbs the greatest amount of water.\nTwo seedlings a blue gum and a plum\nwere placed with their roots In wa\nter, and the height of tbe water was\ncarefully marked. The plants were\nkept in a warm atmosphere and ex\namiued at the end of twenty-four\nhours. The little eucalyptus bad dis\nposed of four times the water that the\nplum bad been able to take up,\nSwing that blue gums Increase In\nheight with great rapidity, often grow\ning many Inches a day in a hot posi\ntion, the amount of moisture taken up\nIncreases ou a greutly progressive\nscale. And this Is just what brings\nabout the downfall of the malarial\nmosquito. To complete Us life cycle It\nis necessary that this insect should\npass Its larval stage In pools of water.\nWith the coming of the eucalypti these\npools and Indeed all marshy places dls\nappear, the breeding spots of tbe mos\nquitoes are gone, and In time tbe in\nsects vanish altogether.\nFire broke out at the residence of\nHerbert Hoover cm Williams avenue\nlast Sunday night, saya the Fallon\nStandard.

A Pernambuco\ndispatch describes the destruction of\nthe Dramatist by a raider. When\nalongside the raider hoisted the Ger\nman naval ensign and signalled to\nstop.

An armed\nboatload of Germans boarded the\nboat, took off the crew and pas\nsengers and sunk the steamer by ex\nplosives. One member of the crew\nof the Dramatist took pictures of the\nraider with a small concealed camera.\nHe claimed the raider appeared like\nan ordinary cargo steamer. When\npassing neutral ships it hoists British\ncolors, but flies the German flag\nwhen it sights a British ship. The\ncaptain said he did not wish to sink\na passenger ship and kill women\nand children.

He will then go to San\nFrancisco and return to his post.\nThe cause for Senor Villaloba\'e\nvisit was his desire to Inspect the\nflotation machine invented by A. H.\nJones, superintendent of the Belmont\nmill, which machine is manufactured\nby Campbell & Kelly in this city.\nCharles Butters has a half interest in\nthe patent\n"I think the machine will answer\nour purposes in Mexico," said the\nsenor. "I am pleased with its effi\nciency and simplicity. I shall take\ngreat pleasure in recommending it\nwhenever I have the opportunity.\n"The greafer portion of our re\nresponse to a question by the\npublic is at peace," he continued in\nBonanza: "There are really only two\nor three states in what may be\ntermed the disturbed territory.

President Ioin\ncare has received Edward Marshall,\nan American newspaper writer, and\ntalked with- him In regard to Presi\ndent Wilson\'s note and the reply of\nthe entente allies. The crux of the\ninterview appears in these words of\nthe president:\n"We are compelled to continue the\nwar until we, our gallant allies and\nourselves, can obtain the reparations\nand guarantees rendered indispensible\nby the aggressions of which we have\nbeen the victims, by the sacrifices\nto which we have subjected ourselves\nand by the losses which we have\nsuffered."\nMay I tell America that France\nis our friend, even though we are not\nfighting with her?" the American visi\ntor asked.\n"The I\'nited States of America and\nFrance are closely united by Inefface\nable recollections, by the same politi\ncal traditions, by the same attach\nment to free Institutions," said Presi\ndent Polncare. "This war, which Ger\nmany unloosed upon Europe and\nwhich France did everything to avoid,\ncould not alter the good relations\nbetieen the I\'nited States and\nFrance. It has even made them\ncloser and strengthened them."\n"Are you willing to make some\ncomment with regard to President j\nIR HAY RRFAK\nIIS illlll SSSallll\nPRESIDENT POUE DEMANDS\nH1PLEIE REPARATION FOR THE\nOUTRAGES CAUSED BT GERMANY\nSUSSING\nAVIATORS\n(Continued from page one)\nwest and at daybreak the 18th found\na trail of one of the rescuing parties.\nFollowing this trail I caught the\nparty about 9 a. m.

That the un\ntamed American citizen may under-1\nstand the importance of this dish it\nis necessary to explain that haggis is\nthe piece de resistance of every\nScotch banquet, since it is the na\ntional dish, commonly made of the\nheart, lungs and liver of a sheep,\nminced with suet, onions, oatmeal,\nsalt and pepper, and boiled In a bag,\npreferably the stomach of a sheep.\nThe local feast is slated for the 25th\nof January, when every man with a\ndrop of Caledonian blood in his veins\nis expected to join in honoring the\nmemory of the plowboy poet. Odd\nFellows hall has been engaged and\nreliable reports are heard that the\nscouting committee has succeeded in\nsecuring a piper who will introduce\nthe skirling of the pibroch to add to\nthe realism of the event.\nThe program will present a regular\nBurns night, with songs, recitations\nand dances with real Scotch kilted\nHighlander laBsies in the fling. By\nengaging Odd Fellows hall the fol\nlowers of St. Andrew will be enabled\nto entertain a much larger number\nthan last year, when the celebration\nwas held in the Mizpah grill, which\nrestricted the attendance.\nWilson\'s note?" the correspondent\nasked.\n"Knowing as we do the feelings of\nAmerica, we have not failed to under\nstand the thought which inspired the\nrecent initiative of President Wilson,\nM. Foineare replied. "We are at\nonce convinced that in the mind of\nthe Illustrious president the sugges\ntions made to the belligerents are In\naccord with the traditional friendship\nbetween our nations. But, being con\nscious that we are fighting for man\nkind, we are finding ourselves without\nthe right to lay down our weapons\nbefore we can sign a peace really\nhumane and which would spare the\nworld from the repetition of\'such a\nterrible catastrophe as this war.\n"Cnhappiiy, It is certain that Ger\nmany, who now pretends to conside."\nherself victorious, although she can\nhardly entertain any doubt as to the\nend, is not ripe as yet for such a\nnecessary peace.\n"The answer which the allied na\ntions collectively have Just given to\nPresident Wilson is perfectly clear\nin this respect. For our part, we\nhave nothing to conceal. We were\nattacked. We are defending our\nselves. But we are not willing to be\nobliged to defend ourselves perpetu\nally against fresh attacks.

Twenty-five cases are under\ntreatment in both private and public\nwards. Many of the applicants are\nfrom other counties who are not en\ntitled to recognition, as the county\nphysician feels that under the present\ndemand for room it is essential that\nthe space be reserved for citizens of\nNye county. Last Thursday a woman\nand family arrived froir. Goldfield and\nwithin a few hours applied to be re\nceived at the county hospital. The\napplication was rejected for the sim\nple reason that there was no room\nand it would have been cheaper for\nthe county to have returned the\nbunch to their own county rather\nthan take them in for an indefinite\nperiod.\nGOOD ATIENDANGE\nAT THE ELKS\'\nE\nThe Elks\' invitation to the first\ndunce of the year brought out the\nfullest attendance at the dancing\nparty given last evening at the club\nhouse.

A feature of the\nevening was the presence of the high\nschool wr Is and boys from Goldfield,\nwho came over to give an exhibition\nof basket ball. As soon as the com\nmittee heard of the presence of the\nyoung folks they extended a general\ninvitation which was promptly ac\ncepted.\nSt. Valentine\'s evening is the date\nof the next affair and the committee\nis preparing some special features\nappropriate to that date.\nNO COAL OR WOOD LEFT\nTO MEET URGENT DEMAND\nThrough a misunderstanding of a\nphone message the Bonanza stated\nthat arrivals of coal and wood were\nsufficient to fill all orders.

THEATER\nOnly those who were directly con\nnected with the production will be\nable to explain how the unusual\nscene of Louise Glaum falling head\nlong through a large pier mirror was\nmade for "The Wolf Woman," the\nTriangle "vampire" story by G. Gard\nner Sullivan, in which Miss Glaum\nand Charles Ray are presented as\nco-stars by Thomas H. Ince. The\neffect is declared to be among the\nmost sensational ever filmed, and for\nthat reason Director Raymond B.\nWest and his camera man, J. D\'. H.\nHerriot, refuse to divulge their secret.\nThe Incident of Miss Glaum\'B fall\nthrough the mirror serves as the\nclimax of the story, as the mishap\nso disfigures her beauty that she is\ncompelled to retire from the lists as\na charmer of men.
