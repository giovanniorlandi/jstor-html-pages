Analysing a major cultural \nphenomenon in recent times\nDe Villers, Pieter GR\nUniversity of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa\npgdevilliers@mweb.co.za\nAbstract\nThis article represents a research overview of the nature, historical roots, social contexts \nand growth of millennialism as a remarkable religious and cultural phenomenon in \nmodern times. It firstly investigates the notions of eschatology, millennialism and \nrapture that characterize millennialism. It then analyses how and why millennialism \nthat seems to have been a marginal phenomenon, became prominent in the United \nStates through the evangelistic activities of Darby, initially an unknown pastor of a \nminuscule faith community from England and later a household name in the global \nreligious discourse. It analyses how millennialism grew to play a key role in the \nreligious, social and political discourse of the twentieth century. It finally analyses \nhow Darby’s ideas are illuminated when they are placed within the context of modern \nEngland in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century. In a conclusion some \nkey challenges of the place and role of millennialism as a movement that reasserts itself \ncontinuously, are spelled out in the light of this history.\nKeywords\nEschatology; millennialism; chiliasm; rapture; dispensationalism; J.N.

Eschatology and millennialism\nChristianity is essentially an eschatological movement that proclaims \nthe fulfilment of the divine promises in Hebrew Scriptures in the earthly \nministry of Christ, but it also harbours the expectation of an ultimate \nfulfilment of Christ’s second coming with the new world of God that will \nreplace the existing evil dispensation. Though there are various ways of \n163\n', '164 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nunderstanding eschatology, whether symbolic or literal, it is a firm part of \nthe Christian discourse. Characteristic of these eschatological expectations \nare motifs like the Antichrist, Armageddon as the ultimate war against \nevil, the millennium of peace, the return (or Parousia) of Christ, the \nresurrection of the dead, the final judgment and the return of paradise. \nThese motifs are especially prominent in the Book of Revelation, perhaps \nthe most important source of eschatological expectations.\nOf special interest to many readers of Revelation was the cursory, enigmatic \ndescription of the millennial reign of Christ together with the saints that \nis mentioned in Revelation 20:1–6 which forms part of the end events \ndescribed in Rev 21–22.1 The literal interpretation of this passage gave rise \nto what would become known as chiliasm and millennialism, that is, a \nsystem of belief about Christ’s reign of a thousand years at the end of time. \nThis doctrine or belief, though for a long time one of several eschatological \nexpectations, began to play an extraordinary role in the religious discourse \nof the late nineteenth and twentieth century.\nThe expectation of the end is not unique to the Christian discourse. \nChristian authors found its roots in Hebrew Scriptures in prophetic books, \nparticularly in passages like Daniel 7:13ff with its vision of the Son of Man \nwho shall come on the clouds. Christian eschatology shares some features \nwith its Jewish heritage by taking over the millennium motif. Some Jewish \napocalyptic texts expected a Messianic interregnum that will precede \nthe end as in significant writings like 4 Ezra 7:28 and 2 Baruch 40:3. But \neschatological expectations are also prominent in the Sibylline Oracles 3, \nthe Psalms of Solomon 17–18 and Qumran texts. Eschatological thought \npermeates the New Testament. Explicit apocalyptic passages are found, for \nexample, in Mark 13 and its parallel passages in the other Gospels, but \neschatology is also a firm part of the gospel message of Christ’s teaching \nabout the coming Kingdom of God. Revelation reflects this apocalyptic \nmindset, but fills it in with unique details – like, for example, the thousand \nyears of Revelation 20:1–6. The millennium motif did not escape the \nattention of early Christian writers like Justin Martyr (Dial. Tryph. 31), \n1 The prominent place of millennial expectations is discussed by Steven D. Aguzzi, Israel, \nthe Church, and Millenarianism: A Way beyond Replacement Theology (New York: \nRoutledge, 2018).\n', '165De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nIrenaeus (Adv.Haer. 4.8.11) and Tertullian (Adv. Mar. 3.7, 4.10–11) who \nassociated the second coming of Christ with a millennial view of the future \nand of end events.2\n2. The flourishing and fragmenting of millennialism\nExpectations of the end vary from time to time. Interpreters read \neschatological passages in the bible in various ways and apply it differently to \ntheir contexts. The result is a plethora of interpretations of the millennium \nin general, but also of its various components, like, for example, the \nAntichrist, the timing of the second coming and the rapture.\nRevelation’s remarks about the future were read within mainstream, \nestablished groups in a rather low-key manner as referring to the completion \nof world history. This interpretation dominated the Christian discourse in \nmany countries for a long period of time. The millennium is regarded as a \ndoctrine about the “last things”, the future time when the final dispensation \nwill be inaugurated and evil eradicated. Revelation 20:1–6 was understood \nsymbolically or spiritually as having to do with the ongoing history of the \nchurch after the resurrection of Christ and the spiritual bliss the church \nwill ultimately enter and enjoy.3 This interpretation became known as \n2 A useful overview of eschatological expectations is to be found in Everett Ferguson, \nThe Early Church at Work and Worship. Vol. 2, Catechesis, Baptism Eschatology and \nMartyrdom (Cascade Books, Eugene, OR., 2014), 213–243. See also G.K. Beale, The \nBook of Revelation. NIGTC (Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, MI., 1999), 44–54. It should \nbe noted that eschatological views are not exclusively part of the Judaeo-Christian \ntradition. It was widespread in the ancient world, as is evident from apocalyptic texts \nthat originated in other religious traditions during that time. For a broader overview \nof these expectations in Antiquity, see John J. Collins, Apocalyptic Eschatology in the \nAncient World, in Jerry L. Walls (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology (Oxford \n/ New York, Oxford University Press, 2008), 151–69. See also Judith Kovacs and \nChristopher Rowland, Revelation. (Malden, MA/Oxford: Blackwell, 2004).\n3 This position continues today, as is reflected, for example, in the following elaborate \nremark from an Eastern Orthodox author on a website that contains several articles \nthat are critical of millennialism: “It is not difficult to see the error of the chiliastic \ninterpretation of the twentieth chapter of the Apocalypse. Parallel passages in Sacred \nScripture clearly indicate that the ‘first resurrection’ signifies spiritual rebirth into \neternal life in Christ through baptism, a resurrection through faith in Christ, according \nto the words: “Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give \nthee light” (Eph. 5:14). “Ye are risen with Christ”, we read many times in the Apostles \n(Col. 3:1 and 2:12; Eph. 2:5–6). Proceeding from this by the thousand-year reign one \nmust understand the period of time from the very beginning of the kingdom of grace of \n', '166 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\namillennialism. It is commonly understood as the result of the influence \nof such major theologians like Origen and Augustine who rejected a literal \ninterpretation of the millennium as Christ’s reign on earth for a thousand \nyears. Many mainstream churches ascribe to this more non-literal reading \nand incorporated it as their official view on the end. Where this was not the \ncase, and groups preferred to hold on to a more literal reading, chiliasm as \na doctrine was more or less tolerated as a personal point of view that did \nnot compromise the major teachings of the church.\nIn contrast to this position, millennialists read Scripture literally as a \ndocument with specific predictions of the end times and events. Some \nboldly foretold a specific date on which the return of Christ would take \nplace and the end will be inaugurated.4 In their view there is a progressive \nunfolding of world history in increasingly evil phases. The millennium \nrepresents the beginning of the last, climactic phase when Christ will \nreign with the saints for a “thousand” years (Rev 20:1–6). They place \nthemselves just before the last phase, because they are convinced that the \nend is imminent. Eschatological movements are characterized, therefore, \nby a sense of urgency that the “signs of the end” are present and that the \nAntichrist is about to appear for war.5 In some cases the expectations run \nso high that believers resort to revolutionary actions to help inaugurate the \nend because they are convinced that they need to actively to take part in \nits unfolding. In the course of history, such revolutionary actions were the \nreason why millennialism was viewed negatively and dangerous.\nthe Church of Christ, and in particular of the triumphant Church of heaven, until the \nend of the world. The Church which is militant upon earth in essence also is triumphant \nin the victory performed by the Saviour, but it is still undergoing battle with the ‘prince \nof this world,’ a battle which will end with the defeat of Satan and the final casting of \nhim into the lake of fire.” See for this, Michael Pomazansky, “The Error of Chiliasm”, \n[Online] http://orthochristian.com/86555.html [Accessed: 20 November 2018]. He does note, \nhowever, that early Church authors like Justin Martyr and Irenaeus subscribed to \nchiliasm. See further below.\n4 The historical development has a calendric quality, systematized with the use of \nnumbers in Revelation, like 3, 4, 7, 12 and 666 and dates about days, months and years.\n5 See Glenn W. Shuck, Marks of the Beast: The Left Behind Novels and the Struggle for \nEvangelical Identity. (New York/London: New York University Press, 2009), 42. He \nnotes how, in the Left Behind texts, signs of the times were pointed out, even though \ntheir authors knew that they were still waiting for the end to come.\n', '167De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nAlso characteristic of these groups is that they relate Revelation directly \nto their own times and places with no or little regard for its relevance and \nparticular meaning in its original first century context in which it was \nwritten. They link biblical passages about end events with what happens in \ntheir much later political, social and historical situation. They do such with \nmuch confidence, claiming divine inspiration and thus allocate special \nstatus to their own predictions. They communicate “special” knowledge \nthat has been revealed to them as “prophets” and empowers them to unmask \nevil people, institutions and events in their own times. At the same time, \nthey regard themselves as the faithful saints and elect few who resist evil and \nwho will inherit the future bliss as reward for their faithful discipleship and \nwitness. They see themselves in the role of the two witnesses in Revelation \n11 that proclaim the gospel to the unconverted nations who oppose God \nand serve evil (Rev. 11). They also identify themselves with two of the \nseven churches of Revelation 2–3 who have a duty to convert lukewarm, \ncompromising believers, including those believers from mainstream \nchurches who criticise or oppose their convictions. They do not mince their \nwords so that their proclamation is often a virulent, vindictive judgment of \nthe church and world.\nThe dynamics inherent in interpreting biblical passages and appropriating \nthem to later situations, contributed to the fragmentation of millennialism. \nThis is shown by the different understandings of the end times. Except \nfor the amillennial approach, mentioned above, there are various, even \nconflicting positions within the millennial tradition. There is a premillennium\nposition that teaches that a millennium will be set up between \nthe rapture of the church into heaven when Christ comes and the final \nreturn of Christ to judge the world. In contrast to this, the postmillennial \nview places the millennium after the second coming.6 Matters are, however, \n6 For an early, but still informative discussion of chiliasm, see Johann Peter Kirsch, \n“Millennium and Millenarianism.” The Catholic Encyclopaedia 10 (New York: \nRobert Appleton, 1911). [Online] New Advent. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10307a.\nhtm [Accessed: 1 June 2019]. Also, William Masselink, Why Thousand Years? (Grand \nRapids: Eerdmans, 1930), 20–30. He spells out the position of Reformed and Lutheran \nopponents to chiliasm, but also notes its prominence among other German Lutheran \ngroups. Masselink’s troubling discussion of the “Jewish” expectation of a Messianic \nKingdom is, however, a sad indication of the scandalous, reprehensible depiction of \nearly Jewish literature by scholars in the early twentieth century.\n', '168 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\neven more complicated than these three trajectories. There is a bewildering \nnumber of views on the rapture as groups hold on to a pretribulational \nrapture, a posttribulational rapture, a partial rapture, a midtribulational \nrapture or a pre-wrath rapture.7\nThe fragmentation is an indication of the many people who retained \ndifferent understandings of the millennial. This fragmentation did not \nimpede its growth. Interest in the millennium reached a fever pitch by \nthe end of the twentieth century with the approaching end of the second \nmillennium and became one of the most remarkable cultural phenomena \nin modern times. Wild expectations about the imminent end of the world \nbegan to circulate among those who held on to literal readings of apocalyptic \ntexts.8American authors like Jack Van Impe, John Hagee, Hal Lindsey9 \nand Tim LaHaye who promoted the teaching, became household names \nwithin evangelical circles in the U.S., but also among secular audiences. \nThe immense popularity of these “Left Behind” books, as they became \nknown, is illustrated by the fact that LaHaye’s 12 novels sold more than \n80 million copies. These publications were further popularized through \n7 See for these, the contents page in Paul N. Benware, Understanding End Times Prophecy: \nA Comprehensive Approach. (Chicago: Moody Press, 2006).\n8 Historical research reveals that similar hysteria existed at major calendric changes \nin the year 500, 1000 and 1500.

Darby, Dispensational \nEschatology and the Formation of Trans-Atlantic Evangelism”, in Schweizerische \nZeitschrift für Religions- und Kulturgeschichte 110 (2016): 99–109. He refers (104) to \nmillennialism as a “distinctively American cultural phenomenon” and agrees that \nDarby, who popularized the rapture, became one of the most influential Protestant \nthinkers after John Wesley, Martin Luther and John Calvin (102). Symptomatic of these \ndevelopments in the United States were millennial communities like the Jonestown \ngroup where 913 members of the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project died of poisoning \nin Guyana in 1978 under the leadership of Jim Jones, their charismatic leader and the \nBranch Davidians in Waco, Texas who awaited the end of the world. The tragic fate of \nthese groups was widely reported in the media all over the globe, further intensifying \nthe interest in millennial expectations. See on the latter, Pieter G.R. de Villiers, 2018, \n“The spirituality of apocalyptic and millenarian groups. The case of the Branch \nDavidians in Waco,” HTS Teologiese Studies/Theological Studies 74(3), a5152. https://doi. \norg/10.4102/hts.v74i3.5152. Also, Alissa Wilkinson, “The ‘Left Behind’ series was just the \nlatest way America prepared for the Rapture,” The Washington Post, July 13, 2016.\n', '169De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nfilms, video games and even bumper stickers for cars.10 One sticker warned \nothers that the driver of the may be missing because of the rapture that had \ntaken place. These stickers, in turn, evoked ridicule and, in turn, generated \na new set of stickers. There were, for example, stickers that stated: “Come \nthe Rapture – Can I have your car?” or “Come the Rapture, the world will \nbe ours again.”\nThe “Left Behind” books were preoccupied with millennialism and a \nrapture as an important turning point in world history when the born-again \nChristians who lived an exemplary life will unexpectedly be snatched away \nfrom earth to join Christ in the air. They claimed that 1 Thessalonians 4:17 \nprovides the biblical foundation for this interpretation. After the rapture, \nthe elect few will remain with Christ for a thousand years. Their reign of \npeace and bliss contrasts starkly with the fate of a large number of believers \nwho are “left behind” and will only be saved if they persevere through the \nAntichrist’s war of seven years. Also striking is the way in which the fate \nof these remainers is integrated within particular historical events in the \nMiddle East. The tribulations of the end will take place after Israel will be \nrestored physically to the promised land and has made peace with other \nnations. The interpretation is further characterized by a conspiracy theory \nthat during this time there will be a plot to establish a world empire of \nmany nations in which people will wear the Mark of the Beast and use the \nsame currency.11 Finally, there will be another coming of Jesus after the \nthousand years.12\n3. Darby and millennialism\nThe tantalising question is how it happened that a phenomenon like \nmillennialism became such a dominant feature of the contemporary \nreligious discourse after it functioned previously mostly on its periphery. \nThe question is so important, given the extremely violent consequences \nof millennial groups and their lifestyle among certain groups. This was \nillustrated by the suicide of Jonestown church members and by the military \n10 See https://www.cafepress.com/+rapture+bumper-stickers for many examples.\n11 See also Shuck, Marks of the Beast, 39 and 46–49.\n12 The political implications of the rapture cannot be discussed within the limited space \nof this article. It will be investigated separately.\n', '170 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\ninvasion of the Branch Davidians. Also worrying was asocial behaviour \nlike the disruption of or damage to family life and ties, sexual abuse and \nfinancial exploitation that seemed to affect millennial groups.13 Despite \nthese negatives, millennialism thrived in the contemporary religious \ndiscourse.\nThere was no shortage of answers to why millennialism grew so strongly.14 \nThe impression was created that millennialism thrived on the gullibility \nand vulnerability of disadvantaged, unsophisticated groups on the fringes \nof society who experience times of trauma and oppression. Though there \nare some indications that millennialism may take hold in difficult times \namong some vulnerable people and that it is the result of indoctrination \nby abusive leaders, the situation is much more complex. There are enough \nreasons to question such a generalizing, stereotypical interpretation \nof millennial groups. The influence of a gifted individual, the role of a \nnetwork of communities, the attention of mass media and some social \nconditions show that one cannot reduce this complex phenomenon to a \nsimplistic cause. Of special relevance, though, is new evidence that show \nhow millennialism in modern times feeds on a long, forgotten or neglected \nreligious tradition that existed for centuries in modern England, as need to \nbe analysed in this article now.\n13 See for this the two articles of De Villiers, cited above. The website, https://jonestown.\nsdsu.edu/, with the title “Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple”, \nalso provides insights into these observations. The website states that it aims to offer \na balanced view of millennial movements like the Jonestown Peoples Church and to \novercome the stereotypes that characterize popular responses to them. For the rest \nthe site contains a treasure trove of information, not only for studies of the Jonestown \ngroup, but also for millennial movements generally.

He was, to the contrary, born of a prominent, wealthy family who \nsocialized within aristocratic circles. His privileged context allowed him an \nexcellent education in law. A few years after he was admitted to the bar and \npracticed law, Darby, driven by intense religious convictions and interests, \nbecame a priest in the Church of Ireland. He was respected as a deeply \ncommitted, hard-working, pastor, working among the poor and spending \nlong hours to visit his parish members on daily pastoral visits. And yet, \nremaining frustrated with his spiritual life within this context, he resigned \nfrom the church two years and three months later to join the Plymouth \nBrethren. A major concern to him was the influence of Roman Catholicism \n(popery, as he called it) on the church and state, the authoritarian behaviour \nof the church offices and the liturgy with its high church rituals. To his \nmind the church became too involved with the political authorities and \nthe secular state. He regarded the authority of parliament and the crown in \nthe appointment of clerics, the interference of the state in church matters \nand the requirement of the bishop that converts should swear allegiance to \nthe king as indications that the church has become worldly.16 The state has \nbecome evil in his eyes. Nothing was going to stop the corrupting nature \nand influence of the state on the church. For Darby the church has become \ncorrupt and was in ruins like the seven churches in Revelation 2–3. Other \n15 Gribben, “Darby”, 103, noted, “Darby (1800‐1882), one of the principal leaders of the \nnew religious movement … came from a wealthy family, with immediate connections \nto a trans‐Atlantic social and commercial network that included such luminaries as \nThomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Adam Smith, and Joseph \nPriestly.” For his highly privileged status, see also Donald Harman Akenson, Exporting \nthe Rapture: John Nelson Darby and the Victorian Conquest of North-American \nEvangelicalism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018).\n16 See for example the extensive discussion in J.N. Darby, The Church of England. The \nChurch of God? (London: W.H. Brown, s.a.). [Online] https://www.brethrenarchive.org/\nmedia/360165/is_the_church_of_england_the_church_of_g.pdf [Accessed: 4 June 2019]. He \nbegins the book with the statement, “In replying to the question, Why I left the Church \nof England? I replied, not that the world was in the Church of England, as you say – no \nsuch thing at all; but that I found the system I was mixed up with to be the world, and \nnot the Church of God at all. That is a very distinct thing from worldly people in the \nChurch” (3).\n', '172 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nbiblical texts were used to formulate his ecclesiology. He argues that the \nchurch shows no resemblance to the biblical portrait of the church. He \nnotes, “Such is the history of the Church of England. To turn to Scripture, \nor its idea of a Church, no one thing the least like it can be traced in the New \nTestament, of Old either.”17 According to him the time for a new church, as \nexpected in Revelation, was near. It will come with the return of Christ and \nthe rapture of the elect few to be with Christ.\nThe millennium teaching found its roots, therefore, to a large extent in \nthe personal quest of Darby for spiritual fulfilment, his concern for a \ntransformative faith, the decay of church and state, but also in his quest for \nbiblical light on these matters. Also, formative was Darby’s evangelizing \ndrive and, eventually, the role of mass media in communicating his \nconvictions. Darby became known in international circles when he \npublished a pamphlet in which he described his vision for the church in 1828 \n(The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ) which was widely studied \nthroughout the West.18 Having established his reputation through this \npublication, he often travelled to places in Western Europe (Switzerland, \nFrance, Germany, Netherlands and others) and, later on, in the United \nStates, where he visited seven times. He tirelessly undertook many journeys \nto promote his insights. On one of these he met Cyrus Scofield, a shadowy \nfigure with a dubious career in the Confederate army. Whilst being jailed \nfor forgery, Scofield experienced a dramatic repentance under the influence \nof Reverend James Brookes. Brookes had ties with a group of followers of \nDarby and through him Scofield learnt more about Darby. Later on, Scofield \nproduced a reference bible which was published by Oxford University Press \n(revised in 1907). Known as the Scofield Reference Bible, it became widely \npopular, selling millions of copies.19 Scofield, who accompanied Darby on \n17 Darby, Church of God, 6.\n18 See John Nelson Darby.

Todd Mangum and Mark S. Sweetnam, The Scofield Bible: Its History and Impact on \nthe Evangelical Church (Colorado Springs: Paternoster, 2009), 169, writes, “Sales of The \nScofield Reference Bible in the United States were simply staggering.” They ascribe the \ninfluence to his biblical commentary and to his discussion of current events. “Scofield’s \napocalyptic predictions and assessments of the world’s plight matched uncannily well \nthe situation in which readers of his Bible were living.” [Online] https://books.google.co.za/\nbooks?id=oRKA1w6TPPcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n', '173De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nhis mission journeys, incorporated Darby’s teaching about the rapture in \nthis publication. It helped popularize this teaching among the faithful. The \nwidespread acceptance of this theory in the following decades is an early \nindication of the influence of this Bible, but also of the powerful role of \nthe printed media and also prominent individuals in the contemporary \nreligious discourse.20\nThere is still another reason why millennialism became so prominent. \nMillennial groups depend for their understanding of Scripture on leaders \nwho claim prophetic insight in the hidden meaning of Scripture about future \nevents. Such leaders would not easily acknowledge failures or mistakes. \nWhere leadership changes or is challenged, dissension and fragmentation \nare at the order of the day. This often led to further fragmentation with the \nformation of new groups.21 Darby who was not an easy person to work with, \ndid not shy away from confrontation with and harsh treatment of those who \ndiffered from him. This was the case in his bitter dispute with Benjamin \nWills Newton who had established the Plymouth Brethren with him.22 In \nhis lifetime the Plymouth Brethren split into the more Open Brethren and \nthe stricter Closed Brethren.23 Darby eventually broke away to form the \n20 See Shuck, Marks of the Beast, 36–37. He refers to Moody’s crusades, several wellattended\nprophecy conferences of Drummond and the Scofield Bible that were crucial \nto the American reception of dispensationalism.\n21 The Branch Davidians of Waco, Texas who broke away from the Adventist Church, \nprovides a good insight in this fragmentation: their leadership changed over the years, \nand with those changes a new leader would offer new insights that were unacceptable to \nsome, causing them to break away and form a new group. See for a description of their \nvarious leaders and the formation of groups that resulted from leadership changes, the \ndiscussion in De Villiers, “Branch Davidians.”\n22 See Jonathan D. Burnham, A Story of Conflict: The Controversial Relationship between \nBenjamin Wills Newton and John Nelson Darby (Carlisle: Paternoster Press, 2004). Also \nquoted by Doherty, “Brethren Cult Controversy”, 28.\n23 The history of the Brethren reveals bitter enmity and cruel exclusion of those who \nare regarded as dissenters.

His insights remained immensely influential on Brethren \ngroups, as is evident from the fundamental role that the “Darby Bible” \nplays among Brethren. This book remained a binding factor and continued \nto be read and quoted in later times.\n4. Darby and the rapture\nDarby’s literal reading of the Bible resonated with those who longed for \na clear reading of Scripture and concrete guidance about future events. \nFollowing the narrative of Revelation 20:1–6, he argued that it teaches two \nresurrections: the resurrection of the saints “which is an entirely distinct \nthing from the resurrection of the wicked,” which is also “definitely \ndistinguished … by a thousand years elapsing between the two.”25 The \npassage in Revelation 20:1–6 then states that the saints will return with \nChrist and execute judgment on the resurrected wicked ones at the end. \nDarby explained the rapture in a discussion of Revelation 12. The woman \nin this chapter, representing Israel, gives birth to a son, who is Christ. \nRevelation 12:5 refers to the “catching up” of the son, which Darby interprets \nas the rapture of the church. There is an intimate, corporate connection of \nthe Son, who is Christ, with the church, so that the catching up of the son \nsome.

How literal this reading is, is evident \nwhen Darby sharply criticises amillennial readings. He writes, “Mark how \nthe whole statement shows the perfect absurdity – and it is a sad a solemn \nthing, the influence which this delusion exercises on people’s minds – the \nperfect absurdity of what is called the spiritual millennium.” The verse, he \nemphasises, speaks of the saints accompanying Christ to judge the beast \nand false prophet. “And yet people are looking for the millennium as a state \nof the church down here!”27\nAn essential feature of contemporary millennialism was its dispensational \nnature. Darby uses the prominent number seven in Revelation, to portray \na systematic unfolding of seven era’s or spheres in world history. He names \nthem after biblical motifs as the eras of Paradise, Noah, Abraham, Israel, \nGentiles, Spirit and the millennium / eternity. The last phase also unfolds \nneatly: the saints who are alive and the saints that were dead and have been \nresurrected, will meet Christ in the air. Then follows the tribulation of seven \nyears in which the Antichrist will wage war in order to control the world. \nIt is a time in which Israel will repent. Christ will then return for a second \ntime, destroy the evil forces and judge unbelievers. Thereafter follows the \nmillennium when Christ will rule over the world from Jerusalem. Satan is \nreleased at the end of the millennium and attacks unbelievers who reject \nChrist. Christ conquers the evil forces and the second resurrection takes \nplace. The unbelievers are judged.28\n26 See the discussion of Darby’s exegesis in Michael J. Svigel, “ ‘What Child Is This?’ Darby’s \nEarly Exegetical Argument for the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church,” Trinity Journal \n35 (2014): 225–51.

Also new \nwas the role of the Jews in the end time: the kingdom of the Jews will be replaced by a \nChristian kingdom. The pattern of thought behind this is the Jewish expectation of a \nmillennium. The Messiah will return to earth to reign for a thousand years as the king \nof the Jews, who had once rejected him as their ruler but who would now accept him. \nWithin Darby’s conception believers will inherit the blessings promised to Jews with \nthe rapture. He does accord to the Jews some role in the end time, but then only as those \nwho will believe in Christ when they experience his second coming.\n', '176 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\n5. The roots of contemporary millennialism\nA much-repeated criticism of the rapture teaching is that it is the product \nof Darby’s fertile imagination. In John H. Whitehead, “OldSpeak. God \nSo Loved the World that He Gave Us World War III: An Interview with \nBarbara Rossing,” Rossing responded as follows to a question: “Prior to \nDarby, there was no one teaching a line between the so-called rapture and \nthe so-called 7-year period of tribulation, with a second coming of Christ. \nThis was all new, and it began in the 1830s.”29 Such an argument serves \nto characterize his teaching as an aberration, without any support in the \nChristian discourse.\nRecent research has provided more information about previously neglected, \nignored or unknown texts that illuminate the origins of millenarian \nthinking and the rapture. This information is important because it helps \nexplain why the millennial teaching was so important. These texts were \nwritten in England as part of a millennialist trajectory that became \nprominent from the seventeenth century onwards. This trajectory reflects \nmillennial and especially dispensationalist perspectives that existed from \nEarly Christianity to modern times. It illustrates that millennial thinking \nwas more important than is normally thought. There are clear precedents \nin previous times, despite strong attempts to discredit and eliminate it. \nMillennialism was, in the words of Hotson, “an error almost universally \ncondemned within the established Protestant churches.”30 Strong \n29 [Online] https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/oldspeak/god_so_loved_the_world_that_\nhe_gave_us_world_war_iii [Accessed: 27 November 2018]. See also the discussion in chapter \n2 in Rossing, Rapture and “The Origin of the Rapture False Doctrine: John Darby.” \n[Online] http://www.bible.ca/rapture-origin-john-nelson-darby-1830ad.htm It states categorically, \n“The fact that John Nelson Darby invented the pre-tribulation rapture doctrine around \n1830 AD is unquestionably true with a single exception: Morgan Edwards wrote a \nshort essay as a college paper for Bristol Baptist College in Bristol England in 1744 \nwhere he confused the second coming with the first resurrection of Revelation 20 and \ndescribed a ‘pre-tribulation’ rapture. However, Edward’s ideas, which he admitted were \nbrand new and never before taught, had no influence in the modern population of the \nfalse doctrine. That prize goes to Darby.” Some argue that Darby took it over from \na Scottish girl, Margaret Macdonald, who, in 1830, experienced a vision in a healing \nservice which, she claimed, revealed the teaching to her. See Dave MacPherson, The \nIncredible Cover-Up (Medford: Omega, 1991) and the criticism of Paul Wilkinson, For \nZion’s Sake: Christian Zionism and the Role of John Nelson Darby (Colorado Springs, \nCO: Paternoster, 2007).\n30 Howard Hotson, Paradise Postponed.

Hotson, \n', '177De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nprejudices against this trajectory contributed to a historiography of the \nreligious discourse in England that was practically blind for the work of \nmillennialist authors.31\n5.1. Mede, the Father of British Millenarianism\nA specific example of such neglect is the neglected or unknown work \nof Joseph Mede (1585–1638), a professor in Greek at Christ’s College in \nCambridge. Recent scholarship has underlined that he was a prominent \nand influential English theologian and clergyman during his lifetime.32 \nMuch of what Mede wrote, overlaps with the millennialist contents of \nDarby’s teaching, revealing how similar expectations were prominent \nlong before Darby’s time and how it permeated the religious discourse of \nEngland since the seventeenth century. In a recent extensive discussion \nof dispensationalism in seventeenth- and eighteenth century English \napocalypticism, William Watson described Mede as the person who was \nresponsible for the rebirth of British millennialism in the seventeenth \ncentury onwards. He noted his influence on his times and on later \nmillennial movements and dispensational thought.33 It was, furthermore, a \nmillennialism with extensive social and political consequences.\nBy the time Darby wrote his ideas down, millennialism was, therefore, \nalready an established feature of the religious discourse in England. It is \nan illusion to think that the established churches succeeded in eliminating \nmillennial thinking. Millennialism was, as an analysis of Mede’s \nParadise, 3, notes, for example, the condemnation of the Lutherans in the Augsburg \nConfession (1530), the English in the 42 Articles of Religion (1552) and the Reformed in \nthe Second Helvetic Confession (1566).\n31 See Watson, Dispensationalism, 177.\n32 Jeffrey K. Jue, Heaven Upon Earth. Joseph Mede (1586–1638) and the Legacy of \nMillenarianism. (Dordrecht: Springer, 2006), 21, for a biography. He describes Mede as \nthe “patriarch” of millennialism in Britain. See William C. Watson, Dispensationalism \nbefore Darby: Seventeenth-Century and Eighteenth-Century English Apocalypticism \n(Silverton: Lampion Press, 2015). See also Jue, Heaven, 21.

Lim (eds.). The Cambridge Companion to Puritanism. (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2008). Jue mentions other millenarians from this time like Piscator \n(teacher of Alsted) and Thomas Brightman. His essay contains many examples of the \nstrong, extensive influence of Mede on subsequent times and people. See also the views \nof Hotson, Paradise.\n', '178 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nwritings will show, alive and well, always at work within many groups. \nWhat happened in “Left Behind” thinking in the late twentieth century, \ntherefore, was not merely a result of Darby’s work, but reflects a strong \nmillennialist mindset that permeated the religious discourse in England \nover a long period of time long before his time and was transplanted to the \nUnited States through various groups and faith communities. One could \nsay that the popularity of British millennialism reflects a movement with \nlong established convictions that would eventually also influence groups \nin the United States. Darby’s own reception of the rapture would not have \nbeen possible without the existence of this much larger movement.\nThe millennial movement was, furthermore, so influential, because of \nclaims that it is rooted in the biblical message about the future. It addresses \nseminal issues that intrigued faith communities and that related to key \nissues about their own fate and their experiences of contemporary life. This \nis clear from the fact that Mede, like Darby, was also a careful reader of \nRevelation. He was highly regarded by many in his times as its authoritative \ninterpreter. Mede’s best-known publication in this regard was his Clavis \nApocalyptica (the Key of Revelation), which appeared in several versions \nuntil it became a commentary on the whole of Revelation by the time it \nwas published in a revised edition in 1632.34 He speculated that the world \nwould end by 1716. He was convinced that Jews would be converted before \nthe second coming.35 His careful exegesis, knowledge of Greek, his use of \nsources from Antiquity, including Jewish and patristic texts, lent a special, \nlearned character to his views and made an impression as a solid, biblically \n34 R. Bransby Cooper, A Translation of Mede’s, Clavis Apocalyptica (London: J.G. & F. \nRivington, 1833). This translation reveals Mede’s “synchronic” approach to Revelation: \nhe shows how different characters and events in different parts of the book refer have the \nsame referent and “synchronize with each other (7). They reflect “contemporaneous” \nmatters. As an example, he argues that the saints who carry the name of the Lamb on \ntheir forehead, “are universally and exactly contemporary with the beast” (14). Mede \nthus illustrates how the author of Revelation portrays eschatological events in terms \nof opposites (23–24): they relate to the same matter but illustrate it from two different \nperspectives.\n35 Shuck, Marks of the Beast, 33–34, notes the opposition to date-setting among \ndispensationalists, referring to Miller’s embarrassing failed prophecies of 1843 and \n1844.\n', '179De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nbased doctrine.36 As a result many regarded him as the expert on the book \nand consulted him about its meaning.37 His work was widely read all over \nEurope, including countries like England, Ireland, Netherlands and France. \nJue noted that it was the intellectual nature of Mede’s millennialism that \nimpressed not only his own colleagues, but also international scholars.\nHow widespread this movement was, is evident from the life and work \nof other people in various places and countries. This included the Italian \nJoachimists of the third quarter of the sixteenth century. Authors like \nSebastian Castellione, Coelio Secundo Curione, Alfonso Corrado and \nJacopo Brodardo were all millennialists. Some were influential figures, like, \nfor example, Johannes Piscator who published a millennialist commentary \non Revelation in 1613 and Johann Amos Comenius (1592–1670) who \nexpected the millennium to begin in 1672.\nEspecially noteworthy for Darby’s teaching, as well as for the work of Mede \nand the context in England, was the German scholar, Johann Heinrich \nAlsted, whose work was widely read in Europe and the United States. \nIn the United Kingdom Mede acknowledged the influence of Alsted’s \nmillennialism on his thought.38 Alsted (1588–1638) was, interestingly \nenough, a well-known orthodox Calvinist, who developed his teaching of \nthe millennium in terms of a close reading of Revelation 20. He published \nit in a publication with the title, Diatribe de mille annis apocalypticis. \nThis work, though sober in its description of end events, represented a \nbreakthrough in his tradition and would resonate widely with authors from \nthe same tradition in England. Hotson describes this book as “the first work \nby a mainstream Protestant theologian exclusively dedicated to defending \n36 Arthur W. Wainwright, Mysterious Apocalypse: Interpreting the Book of Revelation \n(Wipf and Stock: Eugene, OR., 2001), 69, notes, “The effect of Mede’s interpretation \nwas far-reaching in England. He kept away from the arena of political controversy, \nbut his work gave intellectual respectability to millenarian speculation in the world of \npolitics.”\n37 Jue, Heaven, 15, describes the extent of this international correspondence between him \nand others from the continent.\n38 Jue, Heaven, 15 analyses how networks were established beyond England across Europe \nand North America to interact with other scholars about matters of academic interest. \nThis state of affairs shows how religious groups with similar interests interacted beyond \nthe borders of their own countries already in the first half of the seventeenth century.\n', '180 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nthe doctrine of a future millennium.”39 Already in the seventeenth century, \nthen, the fundamentals of millennialism were alive and well in England.\nIn this short, but carefully formulated work with its calculations of \nnumbers, Alsted went so far as to determine 1694 as the moment that the \nend of the world will take place.40 He reached this conclusion by analysing \nRevelation as a book that provides information about the phases of world \nhistory. Each of the septets in Revelation represent a phase in this unfolding \nhistory. The septet of seals (Rev 6) recounts the history of the church until \n606, the septet of trumpets the phase until 1517 and the septet of bowls the \ntime until 1694. Alsted expected the millennium to begin after the fall of \nthe pope in Rome and Roman Catholicism. The millennium, he further \nnoted, would comprise the resurrection of the saints and the conversion \nof the Jews.41 One recognizes in this system features of the dispensational \nmindset that would influence Darby and the “Left Behind” literature.\nInfluenced by and following in many ways Alsted’s predictions of the end, \nMede also offered a dispensational reading of Revelation. He calculated \nnumbers and symbols in Revelation to produce a chronology of events. \nFor him world history unfolds in seven phases, four of which were still \nto take place. Of particular importance, though, is his description of the \nlast two phases, which is also relevant for rapture teachings of later times. \nWithin hundred years, he postulated, Christ will return to wage war \nagainst the Antichrist, to resurrect the saints and to be together with them \nfor a thousand years. The kingdom represents an intermediate state of a \nthousand years before the end will come. A seminal characteristic of Mede’s \neschatology is that the dead will be raised physically at the beginning of \nthe millennium. The millennium will be complete with the judgment of \n39 Hotson, Paradise Postponed, ix.\n40 See Wainwright, Apocalypse, 68. Also Robert G. Clouse, “Johann Heinrich Alsted \nand English Millennialism,” Harvard Theological Review 62 (1969), 189–207. Alsted’s \ninfluence on English theologians is confirmed by the criticism of Hayne and Baillie, \ntwo church leaders who found it necessary to oppose his speculations about the \nend as dangerous, as Clouse points out (199–200). See also Howard Hotson, Johan \nHeinrich Alsted 1588–1638: Between Renaissance, Reformation, and Universal Reform \n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) who describes him as a pioneer of Calvinist \nmillenarianism. Alsted was a delegate to the famous synod of Dordt that is known for \nits orthodox decisions.\n41 Wainwright, Apocalypse, 68.\n', '181De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nthe dead.42 He refers to a “first partial, and as it may be termed, morning \njudgment of the Antichrist, and of the other living enemies of the Church, \nby the glorious appearance of our Lord in a flame of fire, and finishing at \nlength after the reign of a thousand years, granted to the new Jerusalem, his \nmost holy spouse on this earth, and the total destruction of new enemies \nhereafter to arise when the great day is declining, and Satan again loosed, \nby the universal resurrection and judgment of all the dead.”\nThough his text is also as sober and unsensational43 as that of Alsted, \nhe does not refrain from applying the text directly to his own times, \nidentifying, like Alsted and many other millennialist authors of his time, \nRoman Catholicism as the demonic enemy of the saints and the pope as \nAntichrist.44 Other key motifs in millennial thought are present in his \ncommentary. He also mentions the possibility of a rapture before the \ntribulation45 and allocates an important role to the Jews in the end events. \nHe stated, namely, that the last two phases would end with the return of \nJews to Israel and the final judgement of the wicked.46 The last phase with \nthe destruction of the wicked will happen only when Christ intervenes by \nresurrecting martyrs and establishing a reign of a thousand years. He thus \n42 Wainwright, Apocalypse, 68.\n43 Mede, aware that his millennial reading deviates from the established position, goes \nout of his way to defend his views. He writes, “In so great a mystery, it will be sufficient \nto maintain the thing in a general manner, and not to inquire too curiously into the \nreasons of each particular part.” See Cooper, Clavis, 433 where the English translation \nof his Latin text is found.\n44 Mede writes extensively about the role of Roman Catholicism in England. See, for \nexample, his long discussion of the bowls which he often interprets as referring to \nthe judgment of the Roman Catholic Church, in Cooper, Clavis, 419ff. Rome is the \n“apocalyptical Babylon” and “the pope was the Antichrist) (419–420). Wainwright, \nApocalypse, 69, notes how Mede calculated the time between 1625 and 1715 for the \ncoming of the millennium. He used the number 1260 in Revelation 11:2–3; 12:6, 14; \n13:5) to count from three possible starting points: the 365 (the death of emperor Julian), \n410 (the fall of Rome) and 455 (the death of emperor Valentinian).\n45 Wainwright, Apocalypse, 83, notes that Mede mentions it, but did not commit himself \nto the doctrine. He adds, “In the nineteenth century, William Cunningham accepted \nthe doctrine, and it was put forward at the Albury Park Conferences (1826–30) in which \nHenry Drummond and Edward Irving participated.”\n46 Mede interprets the sixth bowl as referring to the arrival of new enemies of the beast \nwho are “the Israelites, wonderfully converted to the pure faith and worship of Christ, \nand now become candidates for the kingdom promised for so many ages.” See Cooper, \nClavis, 427–28.\n', '182 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\ndistinguishes a millennial dispensation from other eschatological events, \nsimilar to what Darby did more extensively some decades later.\n5.2. Other roots of millennialism\nThe dispensationalist aspects of Mede’s millennialism are, for example, not \nentirely unique. Boyer showed how the notions of dispensationalism and \npre-millennialism that contributed to Darby’s insights, can be traced in \nsome general way to dispensationalist schemes by authors like Joachim of \nFiore or to Protestant Evangelicals.47 Other authors also refer to similar \nthoughts in various texts from modern times. Benware noted, “As early \nas 1687, Peter Jurieu, in his book Approaching Deliverance of the Church \n(1687), taught that Christ would come in the air to rapture the saints and \nreturn to heaven before the battle of Armageddon. He spoke of a secret \nrapture prior to His coming in glory and judgment at Armageddon.”48 \nMore specifically, though, Benware points to remarks of early authors that \nimplied some basic form of rapture of the saints to heaven as an imminent \nevent that would take place separately from the Second Coming and that \nwould provide a place of security and peace to them in the last days. These \nremarks were made by writers like Jurieu (1687), Doddridge (1738) Gill \n(1748), Macknight (1763), Scott (1792). In the United States, clergy who \ndistinguished , but, more importantly and relevant for this discussion, is \nhow rapture doctrine can be found in the writings of early interpreters \nlike, for example, the Puritan preachers Cotton and Increase Mather. Also, \nof specific relevance is a reference by Ice to Edwards, a pastor from Wales \nwho settled in the United States in 1761 in Philadelphia and who expected \na rapture on the basis of Daniel’s 70th week, happening 3 1/2 years before \nthe Parousia.49\n47 Paul Boyer, When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern American \nCulture (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1994), 88. For another discussion of \ndispensationalism, see Alan P.F. Sell, Confessing the Faith. Yesterday and Today. Essays \nReformed, Dissenting and Catholic. (Cambridge: James Clarke, 2013), 235ff. who traces \nmillennialist authors from antiquity ((Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Origin, Augustine \netc. to modernity). Also: Slade, “Critical Review”, quoted above. Kovacs and Rowland, \nRevelation, 200–214, offers a valuable oversight of millennium readings since antiquity\n48 Paul N. Benware, Understanding End Times Prophecy: A Comprehensive Approach \n(Chicago: Moody Press, 1995).\n49 Tommy Ice, “Morgan Edwards: A Pre-Darby Rapturist,” The Conservative Theological \nJournal, April 1997, 4–12.\n', '183De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nMede, Alsted and a large number of authors all held on to a premillennial \neschatology in a time that the amillennial position was the established \nview of mainstream scholars and churches in England. One could argue \nthat the bitter hostilities, including the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), \nmainly between Roman Catholics and Protestants, were the reason for the \ngrowth of this teaching. Alsted developed his reading of Revelation within \nthe context of this war with the pastoral intent to comfort believers who \nexperienced its devastation caused by during his lifetime. Mede’s work \non Revelation was also written in a similar difficult context with strong \ntensions, hostility and divisions between groups in society and church that \ngenerated much anxiety. It was a time of deep pessimism. The Church of \nEngland “would be torn apart by embittered factions insisting on more \nthorough reforms, while Parliament itself would repudiate the divine right \nof the monarch plunging the nation into civil war.”50 And yet – even though \nthe turbulent times in which he lived and studied influenced the way he \nconceptualized his millennialism, it was the study of Revelation which was \nthe most formative factor. Religious needs, the desire and even anxiety to \nknow more about the future pronouncements in the Bible, but also the \nseminal place of eschatology in Christianity were more important factors \nthat played a role in the growth of millennialism. In total, though, these \nauthors show the existence and vibrant nature of millennialism in Darby’s \ntimes and contexts, long before he actually conceptualised his version of it.\nRecently Akenson provided new and intriguing insights in the life and \nwork of Darby within the context of the religious context of England and \nIreland, but also in the wider context of the continental religious discourse. \nHe notes how authors, “embraced a congeries of ideas that in, say, 1800 was \nalien to the overwhelming majority of Protestant clerics and theologians \nin western Europe: an extremely literalistic reading of big swaths of the \nBible that orthodox churches read allegorically; a belief that Jesus would \nphysically appear on earth; an interpretation of biblical prophecy that \naffirmed it to be, when read properly, a precise map of how the world would \nrun from Jesus’s return onward into a deep eternity.” Akenson describes \nthe expectation of a secret rapture as “a truly brilliant invention, easily \n50 Jue, Heaven, 19; also 31. [Online] https://books.google.co.za/books?id=p3ISegPdi1sC&printsec=fron\ntcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n', '184 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nthe most creative part of the radical evangelical program as it issued forth \nfrom Ireland,” but then adds, “whether it was created by Darby or in fair \ndegree borrowed from elsewhere is not a matter on which there is probative \nevidence.”51 In other words, there is no convincing evidence to determine \nthe origins of the rapture teaching.\n6. Conclusion\nThis discussion shows that there did exist pronouncements of authors in \nearly modern England with motifs that were similar to Darby’s rapture \nteaching. These readings played a seminal role and often had far reaching \nconsequences for the situation of the church, state and society. It should \nbe remembered that millennialism was a prominent phenomenon in the \nBritish Empire as a colonial power that dominated large parts of the globe. \nIt would ultimately make its presence felt all over the Empire, as those who \nrepresented the empire took their religious convictions with them wherever \nthey would travel. It remains intriguing to see how millennialism took root \nin colonial outposts through the religious activities of church folk.52\nMede strongly influenced the subsequent religious, ecclesiastical and \npolitical history of England.53 He participated in a long tradition of \nmillennialism that would eventually form the foundation on which Darby \nwould build his rapture teaching. Clearly, then, Darby’s rapture is not \nas entirely new as is suggested by his critics. He did, as is to be expected \nwhen an individual appropriates biblical texts, systematise and develop the \nteaching in a particular way. Darby developed his reception of a trajectory \nthat was popular among laypeople, marginal groups, but also among \nacademics, intellectuals and church leaders.\nThis trajectory certainly drew criticism. By times it was so strong that \nmillennialism was relegated to the margins of the religious discourse.54 \nThis criticism ranges from the obvious derision of failed predictions to \n51 See the first chapter in Akenson, “Rapture for this quotation and for a full description.”\n52 The prominence of millennialism among some of the most influential church leaders in \nSouth Africa requires a separate investigation. I hope to address that issue in another \narticle.\n53 See the publications of Jue, who describes the political consequences of his writings.\n54 Kovacs and Rowland, Revelation, 200–214. discusses some of the critics and their \ncriticism.\n', '185De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nwarnings about negative consequences, especially when it elicited asocial \nbehaviour, violent uprisings against the state and personal suffering of \nindividuals.\nEspecially crucial is the discussion about an ethical reading of the Bible. A \nbinary reading of the bible that lives off an agonistic distinction between \nsaints and evildoers, between good and evil, may promote exclusivism \nand othering of people who do not share one’s position. Inherent in the \nmillennialist pessimism about the earth and the present dispensation lurks \na Gnosticism that devalues the existing world and creation. Too easily \nsuch a view may lead people to ignore or neglect serious challenges that \nendangers human existence. The expectation of an imminent judgment and \ndestruction of the world could bring millennialists to argue that matters \nlike climate change and pollution need not be addressed. Millennialism \nmay encourage dangerous political actions, like war in the Middle East, \nbecause such a war is a sign of the approaching end.\nThese considerations draw attention to the fundamental challenge that has \nto do with the way that the Bible is being read. Literal, eclectic readings \ntoo easily ignore the contexts in which the eschatological pronouncements \nbelong. The pronouncement in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 about the rapture into \nthe air was, for example, made by Paul about what was imminent for his \nown time. There is no indication in the text or in Paul’s other letters that \nsuch an event was predicted for later times. There is also no indication in \nRevelation that 20:1–6 should be read in conjunction with 1 Thessalonians \n4. An ethical reading of the Bible requires that one should read it in a \nresponsible way to acknowledge and respect the integrity of biblical texts. \nIn this way the text will not be abused to reflect one’s own prejudices and \nhidden agendas.\nFinally, one should also contrast rapture thinking with the strong tradition \nthat reads Revelation as a prophetic book. From earliest times there were \nmany readers who understood that the book was a prophecy that wanted \nto illuminate the spiritual challenges that face faith communities in \ntheir spiritual journey and that desired to reflect on the will of God for \ncommunities in times of instability.55 Such authors rejected readings \nthat linked the book with predictions about the future or that create \n55 See De Villiers, “Reading Revelation Politically,” cited above.\n', '186 De Villers  •  STJ 2019, Vol 5, No 1, 163–190\nthe impression that it reveals the fortunes of a privileged few. Especially \ninfluential in developing an alternative reading of Revelation were the early \nchurch fathers, Clement and Origen, who called for readers to link their \nliteral reading of the book with a quest for its spiritual meaning. Such a \nreading reflects the heart of the early Christian discourse which interpreted \nthe book consistently as joyful proclamation of God’s compassion for the \nfaithful in their challenging times.\nBibliography\nAguzzi, Steven D.
