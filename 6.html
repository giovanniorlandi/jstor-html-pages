PATRICK\'S DAY, Today is St. Patrick\'s Day, and, as is their wont, the Irish colors, are flying over Burke and Herbert\'s, bank, Southeast corner of King and, Fairfax streets., The peculiarity of the observance, is that March 17th is the date on, which Patrick died, instead of beir., :-iS is usually the case with anniver, saries, the day of birth., There are many other strange fea, tures connected with the celebrated, preacher of the fifth century, in that, there is little certainty about the, events of its life, except that he died, on March 17th. There is less defi, nitely known about him than any, ether historic character., A British museum manuscript, states that Patrick was born in .\'572, at Bonav?ns Tabernae, thought to lie, the modern Boulogne in prance, but, another manuscript gives the place as, fc\'anrevan Taberniae, a district in, Scotland. The Scotch persist that he, came into this world on Scotch heath, er. but at their own Kilpatriek. in, o7". Date and place are thus differ, ent, according to different authori, ties., His birth surname was \'"Succath,", and the Christian name "Patrick.", ?while the name "Patricius\'\' was given, by Pope Celestine to replace 4\'Sue, cath." By some he is said to have, visited Gaui (which includes present, France. Belgium and Switzerland), and Italy, ^yet others declare that he,, l:ke Peter, never saw Italy, or evan, Gaul., Patrick is said to have been opisco, pally ordained at Rome, and again, that he was ordained at home, wher, ever that was.

As a young man he studied, law and was admitted to the bar and, then drifted i:ito newspaper work., He was in Congress when hit State, seceded from the Union. He went, South and made fiery speeches for, secession. lie entered the Confede, rate Army with a commission as, colonel and was one of the party that, began the war by firing on Fort Sum, ter. He was a dashing soldier and, advanced to the rank of b\'rigadier, general. Because of dissatisfaction, with President Davis he resigned his, commission and enlisted as a private, in Fitzhugh Lee\'s command., When the war ended General Pryor, found himself with a large family,, utterly penniless and without em, ployment. Like many other Confed, erates, he made his way to New York,, where, like many others, he received, generous treatment. He first engaged, in newspaper work and then prac, ticed law, using his first fee, which, v.-as $1,000, to bring his family to, New York.
