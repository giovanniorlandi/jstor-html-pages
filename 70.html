Pinkhara\'s Vegetable\nCompound Reals Upon tbe Fact that It\nReally Does Make Sick Womea Well\nThousands upon thousands of Ameri\ncan women have been restored to\nhealth by Lydia E. Pinkham\'s Vegeta\nble Compound. Their letters are on file\nin Mrs. Pinkham\'s oftice, and prove this\nstatement to be a fact and not a mere\nboast.\nOvershadowing1 indeed is the success\nof this great medicine, and compared\nwith it all other medicines and treat\nment for women are experiments.\nWhy has Lydia E. Pinkham\'s Vege\ntable Compound accomplished its wide\nspread results for good ?\nWhy has it lived and thrived and\ndone its g-lorious work for a quarter of\na century ?\nSimply and surely because of its ster\nling worth. The reason no other med\nicine has even approached its success\nis plainly and positively because there\nis no other medicine in the world so\ngood for women\'s ills.\nThe wonderful power of Lydia E.\nPinkham\'s Vegetable Compound over\nthe diseases of womankind is not be\ncause it is a stimulant not because it is\na palliative, but simply because it is\nthe most wonderful tonic and recon\nstructor ever discovered to act direct, y\nupon the uterine S3stem, positively\ncubing disease and displacements and\nrestoring health and vigor.\nMarvelous cures are reported from\nttll parts of the country by women who\nhave been cured, trained nurses who\nhave witnessed cures, and ptsicians\nwho have recognized the virtue in\nLydia E. Pinkham\'s Vegetable Com\npound, and are fair enough to give\ncredit where it is due. If physicians\ndared to be frank and open, hundreds\nof them would acknowledge that they\nconstantly prescribe Lydia E. Pink\nham\'s Vegetable Compound in severe\ncases of female ills, as they know by\nexperience that it will effect a cure.\nWomen who are troubled with painful\nor irregular menstruation, backache,\nbloating (or flatulence), leucorrhcea,\nfalling, inflammation or ulceration of\nthe uterus, ovarian troubles, that\n"bearing-down" feeling, dizziness,\nfaintness. indigestion, nervous pros\ntration, or the blues, should take im\nmediate action to ward off the serious\nconsequences and be restored to health\nand strength by taking Lydia E. Pink\nham\'s Vegetable Compound. Anyway,\nwrite to Mrs. Pinkhain, Lynn. Mass.,\nfor advice. It\'s free and always helpfuL\nPeople who cannot recognize op\nportunity always look to others for\nsuccess.\nI do not believe Plso\'s Cure for Consumption\nhas an equal tor cjughs and colds.

The follow\ning report as to the progress of yel\nlow fever in New Orleans is up to G\np. m. Saturday:\nNew cases, 21; total cases to date,\n227; deaths today, 3; deaths to date,\n47; new foci, 8.\nOf the deaths one occurred at the\nEmergency hospital and was one of\nthe cases transferred there Saturday.\nThe institution now has 19 cases un\nder treatment and today discharged\nits first patient as cured.\nAlthough the unofficial reports made\npublic showed a larger number of\ndeaths than yesterday when there\nwere only two, and the appearance of\na number of new cases, the men of\nscience who are warring against the\nyellow fever plague ended the day\'s\nlabors confident that the situation was\nstill well in hand and with no imme\ndiate prospect of becoming alarming.\nToday\'s official report of yesterday\'s\nprogress of the disease shows that the\nentire section above Canal street was\nfree from a single new case and that\nthe fever was spreading only in the\npoorer habitations of the down-town\nsection, with new cases isolated in\nthe heart of the French market. The\nhealth authorities continued to hold\nalso that the plague remains an\nItalian infection, all except two of the\ntwenty-six cases reported being of\nthat nationality. Almost without ex\nception since the beginning of the\nfever those who have fallen victims\nto the disease have been of the poor\ner classes of the population, many of\nthem not long residents of the United\nStates, and, therefore, unacclimated.\nDeaths have been principally of\nItalians. The first death in the Emer\ngency hospital occurred today. The\nhospital was opened yesterday with\nthirteen cases and an equal number\nwas added today. Into the hospital\nare being sent the worst cases of indi\ngent unfortunates. It is reported that\nthe mortality in this direction will be\nunusually high.\nPERMANENTLY SUSPENDED.\nJewish Newspaper in Russia Has\n. Been Suppressed.\nSt. Petersburg, July 31.

Interior\nMinister Bouligin has recommended\nto the senate that the paper be sup\npressed for good and all on account\nof its generally pernicious and provo\ncative tone, as under the new owner\nship it is considered to be little more\nthan the organ of the Jewish revolu\ntionary society.\nToday, on the occasion of the anni\nversary of the assassination of Minis\nter Von Plehve, the Otrchestva de\nvotes an article to his regime, In\nwhich it declares that it is no won\nder that the land is groaning with\npain, as this year the country wit\nnessing the death of old Russia and\nthe birth of a new Russia.\nAttention is called by the liberals to\nthe great strides made by the reform\nmovement during the year, which has\nbeen marked by the reform edict of\nDecember 25, the grant of religious\ntoleration, the imperial promise of a\nnational assembly and three momen\ntous xemstvoists congresses.\nFuneral of Notabilities.\nParis, July 27.

Y."\nBONAPARTE IS NOT FRENCH.\nHis Mother Was a Woman of Great\nForce of Character.\nNumerous references have been\nmade of late to the alleged French\nancestry of the new secretary of the\nnavy and comment is made on his\nfamous name, the Gallic quality of his\nwit, the shrug of his shoulders and\nthe abundance of his gestures. As a\nmatter of fact, there is not a drop of\nFrench blood in Charles J. Bona\nparte\'s veins. His grandfather, Je\nrome Bonaparte, who married and\ndeserted Elizabeth Patterson before\nhe became King of Westphalia, was\na Corsican of Italian descent, while\nthe Pattersons were Scotch-Irish. The\nnew secretary\'s mother was a down\neast Yankee, a woman of great force\nof character. During the civil war\nshe was aggressively for the Union,\nin the midst of southern sympathizers,\nand her Influence was doubtless more\neffective in molding this rigid moral\nist\'s character and guilding his po\nlitical preferences than the quarter\nstrain of foreign kings in his blood.\nThose who are so touchy to resent\nment always lose the touch of contentment.\nVoice from Arkansas.\nCleveland, Ark., July 31st. (Spe\ncial) Nearly every newspaper tells\nof some wonderful cure of some form\nof Kidney Disease by the Great Amer\nican Remedy, Dodd\'s Kidney Pills,\nand this part of Arkansas is not with\nout its share of evidence that no case\nIs too deeply rooted for Dodd\'s Kidney\nPills to cure.\nMr. A. E. Carlile, well known and\nhighly respected here, tells of his cure\nafter nearly a quarter of a century\'s\nsuffering. Mr. Carlile says:\n"I want to let the public know what\n1 think of Dodd\'s Kidney Pills. I\nthink they are the best-remedy for\nsick kidneys ever made.\n"I had Kidney Trouble for 23 years\nand never found anything that did me\nso much good as Dodd\'s Kidney Pills.\nI recommend them to all sufferers."\nThere is no uncertain sound about\nMr. Carlile\'s statement. He knows\nthat Dodd\'s Kidney Pills rescued him\nfrom a life of suffering and he wants\nthe public to know it. Dodd\'s Kidney\nPills cure all Kidney Ills from Back\nache to Bright\'s Disease.\nInsist on Getting It.\nSome grocers say they don\'t keep\nDefiance Starch.

Father Cavanaugh, the\nnew president of the University of\nNotre Dame, has been at the head of\nHoly Cross seminary since 1S99, and\nis one of the most scholarly men in\nthe Roman Catholic church. He is 35\nyears old, was born at Leetonia, O.,\nwas educated at the parish school in\nthat town and at Notre Dame, to\nwhich he now comes as president, and\nwas ordained in 1891.

It Is in the latest\nstyle, so she determines to have that\nhat or one just like it.\nNo use to try to dissuade her she\nwants that kind of a hat! No other\nwill suit her.\nThere she displays her will power,\nand probably does the same with\neverything she buys for herself or her\nfamily. She makes, as it were, a fem\ninine "declaration of independence."\nIs it not surprising, therefore, to find\nsome few wonvn who still allow their\ngrocers to choose for them in import\nant matters like foodstuffs?\nIn spite of the fact that grocers as a\nrule have long ago realized the neces\nsity of catering to their customers\'\nrather than their own desires, there\nare still a few of the other kind left,\nwho show a marked inclination to per\nsuade customers to take what they do\nnot ask for, or desire.\nTake Lion Coffee, for instance, the\nleader of all package coffees, an estab\nlished favorite for over twenty-five\nyears in millions cf homes, on account\nof its absolutely pure and uniform\nquality.\nwVouldn\'t you thing it impossible\nthat a single grocer can still exist who\nwould oppose such an invincible argu\nment of merit, by trying to persuade\na customer to buy loose coffee in pref\nerence to Lion Coffee?\nLoose coffee has no standard quality\nnobody can guarante- that it is\neven clean.\nOf course, really independent and\nintelligent women know this, and so\ndo up-to-date grocers, but if women\nwere as particular about coffee as\nabout hats, no kind of grocer could be\nwithout Lion Coffee\nIf you don\'t enjoy your own com\npany you should consider your impo\nsition on others.\nf"T permanently cored.

Iu anaemia the blood\nis scanty or thin ; the nerves are imper\nfectly nourished and pain is the way iu\nwhich they express their weakness. In\ncolds the blood absorbs poison from the\nmucous surfaces, and the poison irritates\ntho nerves and produces pain. Iu rheu\nmatism, malaria and the grip, the poison\nin the blood produces like discomfort. In\niudigestion the gases from the impure\nmatter kept iu the system affect the\nblood in the same way.\nThe ordinary headache-cures at best\ngive only temporary relief.
