Fer iustance,\nafter the Judge made the statement that the\nPhilippines had cost us $6.30,000.000, and was\ntold by these highest in authority that he had\never-estimated the amount by fully $450,000,\n000, one can imagine the Judge saying: ""Well,\nI will stick te the $050,000,000, anyway. Te\nacknowledge ignorance or an error at this stage\nof the game we,nld be fatal, and se the $G50,\n000,000 gees te the end of the campaign."\n, Se, tee, with the estimate of the less of\n200,000 soldiers. \' The Judge has since found\nthat we have sent into the field all told only\n122,000, while the casualties from all causes\nare less than 15,000, and yet we can imagine\nthe Judge saying about that, toe: "Well, I\nwill stick te the 200,000 new, for te reduce my\nfigures would only make me appear absurd."\nAnd, en the principle that a lie well stuck te\nis as geed as the truth, the Judge clings te his\nfigures; and, te bolster him up, Edwakd At\nkinson and The Springfield Republican come\nalong and increase the figures threefold. Fer\ninstance, The Springfield Republican thinks\nthat Judge Parker\'s 200,000 dead should be\nfully 000,000, while Edward Atkinson cannot\nfind figures enough te represent the money\nsunk in the Philippines. Why, then, should\nJudge Parker net be stubborn and stick te\nhis original figures, no matter hew far out of\nthe way they may be? The case is hopeless\nanyway; the game is lest, and in only a few\ndays the Judge can retire again te Esopus the\nmost overwhelmingly defeated man in the his\ntory of American politics.
