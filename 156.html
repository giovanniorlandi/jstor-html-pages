S F p\nAN UNPRECEDENTED CASE\n\\ Thorough Research Being Made as to What\nCaused Will Whitten’s Death\nThe death of William Whitten\nat the Monroe House, in Reno,\nFebruary 25, from a shock re\nceived from an electric light fix\nture, has led to much investigation\nas to the cause of death. The re\nsearch is being carried on by Prof.\nJ. (\'«. Scrugham of the engineer\ning department of the University\nof Nevada. There is no similar\ncase on record and this investiga\ntion is for scientific reasons with a\nview to remedying the evil. Prof.\nScrughftm is one of the foremost\nengineers in the West and through\nhis efforts the scientific papers of\nthe country will have several tech\nnical articles upon the death and\ncircumstances that led to it.\nIn an interview Prof. Scrugham\nsaid in part: The burns on both\nthe hands indicate a grounded cir\ncuit through the metal washstand\nupon which the victim was lean\ning. The investigation has prov\nen that there is no ground through\nthis source at present, but at that\ntime the conditions were entirely\ndifferent, as a severe storm was in\nprogress and the ground was satu\nrated with water. The test will\nbe continued under these condit\nions as soon as the weather per\nmits.\nThe test for a ground circuit\nwas made with a lamp, magnet\nand galvanometer. All of the\ntests show no ground at present.\nThe wet weather still increases\nthe chance for grounding the cir\ncuit. By grounding is meant the\nfurnishing of a return path to the\nline through the ground by an\noutside conductor as the wash\nbasin and the metal drainpipe in\nthis instance.\nDeath in cases of this kind are\nusually from heart disease, but the\nsevere burns on the hands would\nindicate electrocution. As it re\nquires from 1700 to 1S00 volts to\nelectrocute when used in cases of\ncriminals, it is possible that a high\ninduced static charge was the\ncause of death in this instance\nThe shock was not received from\nthe wire, as was generally sup\nposed. but from the brass on the\nend of the light bulb.\nPlus is one ot me very lew\ncases on record of death resulting\nfrom a shock on low potential sys\ntems. This line carried no volts.\nAnother remarkable case is that of\nthe death of a Brooklyn lineman,\nwho was killed from 220 volts.\nThis case was commented on by\nthe electric journals.\n\'The investigation of this case\nwill be continued until a satisfact\nory solution lias been obtained.\nImmediately following this the\nwork will be given in detail in a\nnumber of electrical engineering\njournal.—Journal.\nhow tosettTe Wme\\ICO\nNot All Sunshine tor Those Who Desire to\nMake Homes In That Country.\nThe following is from United\nStates Counsul Lespinasse,of Tux\npam, Mexico:\nIn reply to many letters receiv\ned from professional men, clerks\nand mechanics in different parts\nof the United States, 1 deem it\nadvisable to state that the first\nand all-important point for any\none wishing to settle in Mexico is\nto be able to speak the Spanish\nlanguage, otherwise his chances of\nmeeting with success are small.\nAlthough this may not apply with\nequal force to the farmer, who\nnecessarily is not dependent to so\ngreat an extent as professional\nmen and mechanics on a knowl\nedge of the language in order to\nsucceed, still, even to the farmer\nit is a very desirable acquisition.\nFurthermore, all who come to\nMexico should have at least $r,ooo\nto $2,000 in gold. They will then\nbe in a condition to investigate\nand study the people and the\ncountry. At the first glance hun\ndreds of apparently profitable op\nportunities present themselves to\nthe new-comer, but if he is wise\nhe will actually remain investiga\nting for six months to familiarize\nhimself with the commercial and\nsocial conditions which may exist\nwhere he proposes to locate. This\nmay seem an exaggeration, but\neven a year would be still more\nadvantageous, if it were possible\nto remain idle for that length of\ntime. I here is much on the sur\nface that appears seductive, but\nhasty investments are generally\ndisastrous. To this hundreds can\ntestify who hrve plunged thought\nlessly into enterprises concerning\nwhich they had no previous ex\nperience or knowledge. Newcom\ners should make haste slowly,\nidentify themselves with people of\nall classes and nurse their capital\nin order to increase it an hundred\nfold. This is possible since ready\n| money commands an enormous in\nterest, when judiciously invested\nj and protected by the valuable\nknowledge gained during the pro\n| bationary period mentioned.\nRAILROAD ON PAPER\nj It is Possible That Smith and Mason Val\nues May be Traversed.\nThe press dispatches are again\n| industriously projecting a railroad\nto traverse the fertile vallies of\nthis county, as the following will\nshow:\nIt will be a short time only be\nfore an overland railroad will trav\nj el El Dorado county, Cal., from its\n! western to its eastern border.\nThe Sacramento and Placerville,\nis now the nucleus which will con\nnect with the trunk line of the\nCentral Pacific somewhere in Ne\nvada.\n\\\\ here the new line will con\nnect with the Central Pacific in\nNevada is not yet determined. A\nvery rich country would be ex\nplored by passing through the val\nlies of the Walker River, the fer\ntile basin known as Smith Valley\nand Mason Valley, and thence\nthrough Churchill county, Nevada,\nand along the Carson Sink to the\nmain line near Winnemucca.\nThe shorter route but one which\nwill open up nothing but tourist\ntravel and lumber traffic would be\nalong the western shores of Take\nTahoe and thence down the\nTruckee river.\nThe first route spoken of would\ncertainly open up an agricultural\nsection of vast proportions, also\nsome very valuable mineral coun\ntry. Such a route would come\ninto Carson Valley from Placer\nville, thence on through to Smith\nValley and by one of several easy\npasses into the upper end of Ma\nson Valley. From here an easy\nroute could be obtained to trav\nerse the length of this valley and\nthence on into Churchill county.\nSuch a route would open up sev\neral hundred thousand acres of\nagricultural country and some of\nthe best virgin mineral country in\nthe State. Besides it would be a\nmeans of affording cheap trans\nportation for fuel into the copper\nbelt of this valley, which would\nbe the means of again starting up\nthe copper mining industry of\nthis section.\nIt is, of course, a little previous\nto contemplate a railroad of this\nkind, but when the agricultural\nsections are all furnished with\nwater and sub-divided into eighty\none hundred and sixty acre farms\nthere is no doubt that a railroad\nwill be constructed to follow, prac\ntically, the route above outlined.\nGreat enterprises move slowly,\nbut surely, and those who can\nnow secure homes in these dis\ntricts and make a comfortable liv\ning for a few years will in the\nyears to come find that they acted\nwisely, for so sure as one day fol\nlows another our vallies will ere\nlong be overrun by liome-seekers,\nproperty enhanced in value, and\nthe man with a small farm will\nthen find himself the possessor of\n; a property which will yield him\na nice income. .\nEa&g Ces!s Too Much\nWhen the price paid is the mother’s\nhealth and happiness.

New York', 'LYON COUNTY TIMES,\nYERlNO TON, - NEVADA\nSaturday.March 12, 1904.\nIt is reported that Senator\nNewlands is negotiating for the\nsale ot his large ranch on the Car\nson River in Lyon county. It is\nto be hoped that the ranch will\npass out of his possession, as in\nthat event something may be done\nwith it to make it of some value.\nSince Mr. Newlands has owned\nthe property it has deteriorated in\nvalue from year to year, the stands\nof alfalfa and wild hay which\nmade the former owner of the\nproperty wealthy have been al\nlowed to die out, the ditches have\ngrown full, and a fine property\nhas almost completely gone to\nruin, notwithstanding the fact that\nits owner has the capital where\nwith he could have irrigated near\nly every acre of the property, cut\nit up into small farms and done\nmuch good for the county and\nState, besides demonstrating the\npracticability of irrigation. But\nthe great irrigator chose to lay\nback until the government started\nthe work, and then he was the\nfirst one to get a gran at the gov\nernment irrigation appropriation\nby selling to Uncle Sani a portion\nof a reservoir site for $40,000,\nwhich, if it were not needed for\nsuch a purpose, is not worth $40.\nIt is surely paying the Senator to\nbe an irrigationist, and he is losing\nno time in unloading while the\nopportunity affords.\nIn speaking about what can be\ndone on small farms in California\nSunset for March says: In 1902 a\nman sold from a small farm of\ntwelve acres of vines 15 tons of\nraisins at 4 cents a pound, which\namounted to $1200. In addition\nto this, he sold $90 worth of black\ngrapes, giving him a gross income\nof $1290. As he had to pay $170\nfor help in picking, his net sales\namounted to $1120, to which he\nadded $325 by working for adjoin\ning farmers. And so the small\nfarm pays—and pays well when\nproperly handled. This is of par\nticular interest, as the large land\nowners are about at the point\nwhere they will break up their\nimmense tracts into small farms,\nwhich will be the opportunity of\nthe settler.\nThe above also applies to Ne\nvada. It has been demonstrated\nthat small farms will pay much\nbetter than large ones in this\nState, and there is no doubt that\nthe next few years will see many\nof the large tracts of land in this\nState cut up into small farms. It\nis not to be considered that ten- or\ntwelve-acre farms will pay in all\nsections, nor can fruit be consider\ned the crop. But the farms of 80\nto 160 acres will be the farms of\nthe near future in Nevada, which\nwhen well watered and tilled will\nyield an income more than suffic\nient to sustain a good sized family\nand afford all the comforts of a\nmodern farm home. Those who\nget into the State now on this\nlayout will find that they have\nacted none too soon:\nThe Reno Journal says that\nsomebody in the East says that\nthe only thing that prevents Sena\ntor Newlands from receiving the\nDemocratic nomination for Presi\ndent is the fact that he comes\nfrom Nevada. This is another\nslap at the battle-born State. To\nremedy this matter it would seem\nthat the Senator might appropri\nately hail from Maryland. This\nwould also clear things so that\nVanDuzer could secure the nomi\nnation for Vice President.\nA MAN giving the name of John\nDennis has been arrested in Reno\non suspicion of being an incendi\nary. This is not the John Dennis\nwho writes the firey editorials for\nthe Journal. He would no stoop\nto fire at so small a portion of the\nworld as Reno. The world is his\ntarget.\nThe following valedictory ap\npeared in an Indian Territory\npaper recently: “With this issue\nthe Herald-Banner folds its lily\nwhite hands upon its bosom and\nturns its pink toes to the daisies,\nand Milburn, I. T., U. S. A., is\nwithout a paper, having witnessed\nthe death of two. It has cost the\npresent firm $253 to advertise the\ntown, the beautiful blue and fer\ntile soil, and we now throw up the\nsponge and vacate to make room\nfor some other poor unfortunate\nwho may be inspired by the idea\nthat the people of this place\nwill support a newspaper. Ta ta,\nau revoir, good bye. We are gor\ning to do something for you which\nthe devil will never do—leave\nyou.”\nThose who wait for somebody\nto do everything for them rarely\ndo anything for themselves.\nList of Bills Allowed.\nThe following bills were exam\ninecl and allowed by the Board of County\nCommissioners of Lyon County.
