        <pre>['[THE NEGRO PRESS CREDO, The Negro Press believes that America, can best lead the world away from racial and, national antagonisms when it accords to every, man, regardless of race, color or creed, his, feuman and legal rights. Hating no man, fearing, no man, the Negro Press strives to help every, man in the firm belief that all are hurt long, as anyone is held back., * Vol. XIX No. 3, J.F. K. QUEERS FOOD FOR VICTIMS, Mississippi Supreme Court Clears Top NAA C P Official, High Court, Throws Out, Contempt Case, JACKSON, Miss.,—A contempt, of court conviction against an NA, ACP official was dismissed this, week in a unanimous decision by, the Supreme Court of Mississippi, Medgar Evers, the Association’s, field secretary for Mississippi, had, been convicted of “constructive, contempt”, sentenced to 30 days, in jail and fined SIOO for comment, ing to a news reporter that the, conviction of a Negro was a, “mockery of judicial justice.", The Mississippi high court held, that the states evidence against, Evers on the criminal charge of, contempt “wholly failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt” that, the comment hindered the admin, istration of justice in the courts., Taking notice that the case had, been concluded when Evers made, his comment, the Mississippi Su, preme Court declared: “The com, ments were simply unwarranted, criticism of the court and jury in, a case already decided.”, Lawyers for Evers, Robert L., Carter, NAACP general counsel,, and Jack H. Young of Jackson., Miss., had argued in their appeal, to the Mississippi. Supreme Court, that his comment was a valid ex, ercise of his right to freedom of, speech. The court upheld their arg, ument, referring to the general, legal principle that "courts are, subject to the same criticism, as other people when a case is, finished.”, CIVIC UNITY 1, PUBLISHES STUDY, By Natalie Clar, The “Negro Room” was an old, building at the back of Phoenix, Union High School and here, from, 1914 to 1920, bright Negro chil, dren who desired a high school, education were taught.

V, Urban League Sels $lO Million Goal, NEW YORK—Creation of a 10-, million-dollar reservoir of endow, ment funds will be the goal of a, three-year special financing cam, paign announced today by the, National Urban League., Henry Steeger, New York pub, lisher and president of the NUL,, said the drive will be conducted, across the nation, beginning im, mediately, by a newly created, Legacy Development Committee, of the League., This committee, to be headed by, Philip J. Goldberg of New Ro, chelle, N. Y., will seek to en, courage large legacies and similar, sources of financial support to, make specific contributions to the, endowment plan, from which the, League would derive long-range, and continuing income toward ex, pansion of its social service work, in behalf of city-dwelling Negroes, in the years ahead., Mr. Goldberg, an insurance con, sultant, is widely known in the, field of developing programs of, Gay Ladies Fun Night, The Gay Ladies Social and Char, ity Club is having a night of fun, in the home of Mrs. Evaline, Dykes, 4830 South 20th Street on, July 3 from 9:00 until.

En, dowment is the answer.”, The National Urban League is, an interracial, educational serv, ice agency, established in 1910 to, further equal opportunity for Ne, groes in employment, education,, housing and social welfare., Perhaps the greatest victory in, Birmingham is that because of, Mr. Shuttlesworth’s leadership the, Negroes of this city are now more, united than ever before and are, determined to continue their strug, gle to win first-class citizenship., At a recent anniversary celebra, tion of the Alabama Christian, Movement, they voted full support, for Mr. Shuttlesworth., Phoenix, Arizona, Thursday, June 29, 1961, Minister Most, BIRMINGHAM. Ala.-The Rev., (Fred L. Shuttlesworth of Bir, mingham is a likely candidate for, (he title of the most jailed leader, in the civil rights movement., At the moment, he is under con, viction in six separate ca;es for, challenging segregation in Birming, ham. In addition, he is under a, SSOOO peace bond which he is ap, pealing, he faces another charge, in Montgomery scheduled for trial, in July, and his children are under, conviction for defying bus segre, gation in Gadsden., That makes nine criminal cases, pending for the family. Besides, that, Mr. Shuttlesworth is involved, in 12 civil court actions; in five, of them he is a defendant and in, Sub-Committee Meets, With Supt.

C.,—J. Arthur, Brown, president of the Charleston,, S. C., branch of the NAACP and, of the Association’s state confer, ence of branches reported that 14, members of the latest group of, Freedom Riders made full use of, all bus terminal facilities upon, their arrival in Charleston, June, 14., The Riders, including Protestant, ministers and Jewish rabbis, were, welcomed to Charleston by Mr., ißrown, whose branch had ar, ranged overnight accommodations, at the request of Congress of Ra, cial Equality officials., Not only were police activities, restricted to the proper role of, protection, but the Riders accepted, an invitation from Police Chief, William F. Kelly, transmitted, through Mr. Brown, to visit him, at police headquarters. They thus, had an unexpected chance to see, a southern jail from the outside,, as willing rather than as unwilling, guests., Activity of the Charleston branch, in substantially increasing the num, bers of registered Negro voters, over the past two years is thought, to have something to do with the, attitude of police and other muni, cipal officials., Jailed Leader, seven he is the plaintiff. This, makes a total of 21 active court, cases, civil and criminal, in which, he is involved., And this does not count two, civil cases and one criminal case, which lie’s won in the last year., Also uncounted is a contempt sen, tence which he has already served., Birmingham Court Recorder Con, way fined him $lO and sent him, to jail for 24 hours for contempt, on June 2 when he refused to pro, mise not to break any segregation, laws for the next year., “Sometimes I have a hard time, keeping up with all of them my, self.” Mr. Shuttlesworth says of, all his various litigations. “You, know, I didnt really mean to get, involved in so much; I just want, to be free.”, Mr. Shuttlesworth’s battles in the, courts have now been going on for, five years—since 1956 when h e, organized the Alabama Christian, Movement for Human Rights to, fill the breach when the NAACP, was out-lawed in Alabama., He has recently accepted a call, from Revelation Baptist Church in, Cincinnati in order to meet the, economic needs of his large fami, ly, but at the request of Birming, ham Negroes he has agreed to, keep his residence in Birmingham, and will continue to give active, leadership in two Southwide civil, rights organizations—the Southern, Christian Leadership Conference, and the Southern Conference Ed, ucational Fund., NAACP Investigates Discrimination, At Litchfield Naval Air Facility, PHOENIX, ARIZONA—AIthea T., L.

The hearing being, held at Litchfield Park is to de, termine whether or not Mr. Wil, liams’ allegations regarding dis, criminatory treatment against Ne, groes are valid., According to Mr. Williams, Ne, gro employees at this naval faci, lity have been ststematically ex, cluded from job classifications, which mean an increase in salaries, and a ‘‘pattern of discrimination”, obtains in the hiring and promo, tional policies of the unit., Williams applied to the local, s, &> •• \' i*\' , ■ :< ,, CANDIDATE FOR CITY COUNCIL—David Moore, who is seek, ing a seat in the city council, will hold his first meeting Friday,, July 7., Public Service Sets 18 Cent Dividend, Arizona Public Service Company, shareholders of common stock will, receive a dividend of 18 cents per, share on September 1, according, to an announcement by John Ja, cobs, chairman of the board.

S. Postage, Phoenix Arizona, Bulk Rate, Permit No. 498, PAID, Ten Cents, Surplus Sent, To Tennessee, Voter Yictims, NEW YORK-The NAACP ex, posed gratification upon the, announcement this week that Pre, sident John F. Kennedy had au, thorized shipment of surplus food, to Negroes in Haywood and Fay, ette Counties, Tenn., Negroes who had registered to, vote in the counties became vic, tims of economic pressure by, white landowners and merchants., The President’s authorization to, send the food came in a letter to, Agriculture Secretary Orville, Freeman. v, The Chief Executive’s action, in, large part, grows out of a series, of NAACP moves dating back to, March 1960, when John Brooks,, director of voter registration, in, vestigated economic reprisals, growing out of efforts of Negroes, in Haywood and Fayette Counties, to register and vote. The NAACP, submitted affidavits of voting de, nials to the Justice Department, under the Civil Rights Act of, 1957 which resulted in a consent, decree being issued April 25, 1960., John Brooks’ personal investiga, tion of events in Fayette County, confirmed rumors of the economic, squeeze against Negro leaders and, others who dared to register and, vote. Affidavits were submitted, May 1960 to the Justice Depart, ment by the Washington Bureau, detailing the economic reprisals,, including refusal of credit, deni, al of bank loans and refusal of, merchants to sell gasoline, cloth, ing and other necessary items,, as well as the cancellation of lia, bility insurance on automobiles,, tractors and homes., In May, the Association wired, Gulf Oil, Standard Oil of New, Jersey, American Oil and Texaco, urging them to end their refusal, to sell gasoline to Negro farmers, in Haywood and Fayette Counties, and pressed the national oil com, panies for action in behalf of Ne, gro residents, At the NAACP Annual Conven, tion in St. Paul, Minnesota, June, 25, 1960, a resolution was adopted, calling on Negro patrons and oth, ers throughout the country to, withhold patronage from the oil, companies participating in the, boycott against Negroes. The boy, cott was effective and oil was, subsequently delivered to John, McFerren, Negro grocer and lead, er of the Fayette County Civic, and Welfare League., NAACP branches throughout the, country, at the call of the Na, tional Office in August, sent sub, stantial financial assistance, food, and clothing to help out in the, emergency. Bi-monthly, food pack, ages were delivered under the, management of the NAACP Mem, phis branch., In order to take affirmative, steps to end the pressures in the, counties, the Association’s Execu, tive Secretary, Roy Wilkins, call, ed together in New York City on, January 11, representatives of the, American Friends Service Com, mittee, National Sharecroppers, Fund, Congress of Racial Equali, ty and the National Committee for, Rural Schools. The organizations, agreed to work together to coor, d-mate relief activities and to, work out a long-range solution to, alleviate the emergency., It is significant that the Ken, nedy Administration has, in ef, fect. reversed the action of the, Eisenhower Administration on, this issue, because the previ, ous Administration took the, position that a state agency, instead of a federal agency, had to assume such a responsi, bility. The persistent, careful, work of the NAACP, which has, supplied over $15,000 in finan, cial and othqr assistance,, working through the national,, regional and Washington Bur, eau, has resulted in the Presi, dent’s order authorizing the, Secretary of Agriculture to, send surplus food to Haywood, and Fayette Counties designat, ing these areas as economical, ly depressed communities.]', '[Page Two, THE SUN NEVER SETS ON ITS READERS, Published each Thursday by the Arizona Sun Publishing Co, 4014 South Central Avftnue Phoenix 40, Arizona, Telephone: BRoadway 6-6002, Subscription Rates: 1 year—s 3; 6 months —$1.75; 10c per copy, Managing Editor Alton W.

That is not the point at all. The point is not to judge Ihe, beaten, but to take a look at the beaters, and to extend and consider, the ethic by which they decided it was to hurt other people., If the least among men can be hurt with impunity, then the, strongest had better look to their security. That much comes from, the Bible. If you don’t care for the Supreme Court, then look that, one up in the New Testament., The police weakness that permitted bloodshed in Birmingham, loosed a bloodier hate in Montgomery and it will not stop until, the lawful majority rises up out of its torpor, be it induced by, rationalization or intimidation, and takes back the reins from the, bloody hands of the few., Either a community is going to believe in civilization or -, it is going to revert to the Jungle. And when the jungle revision, occurs, erasing heed for restraint and placing its premium on the, teeth most ruthless at the jugular, then no man is safe from preda, tory pack. We have come too far for that., The South’s people are sensitive to cruelty. Why. then, can, the Montgomery outburst occur—at a time especially when this, nation is being challenged by a cynical communism on the decency, of its ideals? It can occur only because the leadership elected by, - people to provide an unswayed justice has been swayed to per, mit injustices in the belief that this is what the people want, Well, is it? J, \' » It is not. The craven reactions in Birmingham and Montgom- ®, ery do not represent what the people of Alabama expect. They \', represent what frightened politicians have trapped themselves into, promising., To blame the violence on the demonstrators is sophistry of ;, the most hurtful order. These people who have gone barnstorming, across the South in buses are curious. If their aim had been to j, change segregation practices, orderly systems were at their dis, posal. If their aim had been to demonstrate, braver people resided, in each precinct they touched and were prepared to make more, meaningful tests. If their aim had been to create a scene deliber- \', ately for destructive rather than constructive purposes, then it is, time somebody toid them, in this Southland where both races are 1, having to work at change, that their theatrical approach violates J, the valid precept that all change requires a little dab of sense., But that is not the point of what happened in Alabama. Any ‘, man in this free country has the right to demonstrate and assem- j, ble and make a tool of himself if he pleases without getting hurt, j, If the police, representing the people, refuse to intervene when a, man—any man—is being beaten to the pavement of an American city, t, then this is not a noble land at all. It is a jungle. But this is, a noble land. And it is time for the decent people in it to muzzle, the jackals. j, CUT OUT AND SAVE <, PRESIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS, C, Executive Order 10925 u, ESTABLISHING TIIE PRESIDENT’S COMMITTEE ON EQUAL j, EMPLOYMENT AND OPPORTUNITY ,, PART 111—OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENT CONTRAC- £, TORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, SUBPART A—CONTRACTORS’ AGREEMENTS, SECTION 301.

Quirk, chairman of the Keep, Arizona Green Committee, and, vice president of Southwest Forest, Industries, a major producer of, lumber and paper in the state,, called on she people of Arizona for, full\'cooperation and extreme cau, tion to protect the valuable pre, serves., “Thousands of acres of trees, have been consumed or damaged, by dozens of fires within the past, week” Quirk said. “These fires, have ranged from the Tonto Na, tional Forest, near Payson, to the, Coronado National Forest, south, of Tucson. In addition to the de, struction of timber, which will take, years to replace, irreplaceable, lives have been endangered and, there is a growing threat to homes, and property.”, Quirk attributed the present sit, uation to the subnormal precipi, tation in the state during the past, winter. "The less than expected, rain and snow have left the forests, bone dry and minor fires become, conflagrations in a matter of min, utes,” he reported. “While light, ning is a major cause, the threat, of man-made fires, through care, lessness, is always present and, cannot be dismissed.”, Announcing that he had asked, the Governor to issue a proclama, tion for the usually dangerous, month of July, Quirk also reported, that he had been in touch with, Fred W. Kennedy. Regional For, ester, United States Forest Serv, ice in Albuquerque., “Forest fire danger in the na, tional forests of Arizona is ex, tremely critical,” Kennedy said,, THE ARIZONA SUN, Arizona Savings Shareholders, Assured Os 70 Per Cent Recovery, Shareholders in the defunct Ari, zona Savings and Loan Associa, tion are virtually assured of re, covering at least 70 per cent of, their savings within the first year, of operation of Greater Arizona, Savings and Loan Association, new, financial institution approved to re, organize the old association which, has been in receivership since June, 15, 1959., This prediction was made b y, Maxwell E. Greenberg, president, of Greater Arizona Savings, in an, address to the Maricopa County, Bar Association in Phoenix last, week., Greenberg also expressed con, fidence that federal approval of, Greater Arizona Savings’ applica, tion for insurance of accounts will, be forthcoming soon., A 12V2 per cent payment of ac, count balances in the oldJnstifu, tifen has already been distributed, by the receivership, Greenberg, said. At least another 37\'/2 per cent, should become immediately avail, able when Greater Arizona Savings, opens with insured accounts, he, stated., To this 50 per cent, another 20, per cent or more will be added, from proceeds of liquidation rea-;, lized during the first year of the, new institution’s operation, he pre, dicted., Reorganization of the defunct, company rather than liquidation, saved shareholders from an im, mediate loss of at least $750,000, which would have accrued from, forced sale of loans at less than, full value, Greenberg said., The reorganization plan also ben, issuing a special plea asking that, everyone be careful with fire of, any kind when in or near brush, covered or forested areas. He ex, plained that the drouth conditions, of the past few years have left the, forests tinder dry and fire danger, has reached an explosive point as, indicated by the large and devas, tating fires of the past week in, Arizona. “Besides destruction 0 f, vital natural resources, these fires, have claimed the lives of two for, est fire fighters, one a rancher, and the other a pilot for one of, the Forest Service borate bombing, planes.”, Although the majority of recent, fires have been started by light, ning, the most destructive one to, date in Arizona was caused by hu, man carelessness. “Now that, school is out,” Kennedy said,, “more and more people are crowd, ing into the national forests for, outdoor recreation, and one mo, ment of carelessness on the part, of anyone could destroy forests, that have taken hundreds of years, to grow.”, The Regional Forester pointed, out that the Forest Service has, already issued formal proclama, tion which restricts smoking with, in the national forests to surfaced, highways, places of habitation and, designated recreation areas.

Total, amount represented is $1.5 million., The reorganization plan offered, by Greenberg and his associates, was recommended by the Arizona, state superintendent of banks and, approved by the Maricopa County, Superior Court and by sharehold, ers whose accounts represent more, than 90 per cent of the total savings, in the old association., Another evidence of public ap, proval of the reorganization,, out, is that an, initial SBOO,OOO capital stock offer, ing in Greater Arizona Savings, was quickly oversubscribed, a s, a subsequent $200,000 offering., Everyone Earns, Happy July 4th, The National Safety Council, opened a double-barrelled Fourth, of July safety campaign aimed at, traffic accidents and drownings., “Everyone deserves a safe, hap, py Fourth of July holiday,” said, Howard Pyle, NSC president. “It, is up to all of us to help make this, possible by eliminating accidents, on the highways and waterways of, our nation., “Though traffic accidents are, still the nation’s prime killer, they, were outnumbered in some states, by drownings over the last Fourth, of July holiday.”, Last year’s Fourth of July holi, day traffic toll was 440 lives., Drownings and boating mishaps, claimed 160 lives. Other accidents,, including fireworks, firearms, heat, exhaustion and falls killed more, than 100 person., “The Fourth of July is almost, always celebrated outdoors,” Pyle, said. “This , means travel, swim, ming and sporting events, coupled, with their inherent hazards. T o, get the most out of all these acti, vities we must remember safety, safe driving and safe play means, going by the rules for the protec, tion of yourself, your family and, others.”, Pyle stressed two points:, 1. Everyone learn to swim. It’s, the best possible insurance against, drowning., 2. Install and use automobile, seat belts for all driving, near, home and on trips., “Seat belts will reduce injury, and help save lives in case of ac, cidents,” said Pyle., “But the need for accident pre, vention-before the fact-cannot lie, stressed too strongly,” he said., First Institutional, ; Baptist Church, 5 Services at First Institutional, ] Baptist Church, 1141 East Jeffer, son Street were exceptional fine, last week.

Every effort is made to, • assure that it reflects an accurate, interpretation of the Arizona law, > as applicable to the stated facts., ,* * *, ■ Partnerships No. 241, I It may be that marriage is the, only partnership many young, people are thinking about at this, . time of the year, and may never, enter any other kind. When and if, ; they do, they should know what, | they are getting into,, i At anytime you go into business, with another, there’s a question, i of relationship to work out-for, i example, whether to form a part, nership of a corporation., The partnership is the most pop, . ular because one can be formed, ; without much trouble, and in a, \\ burry. It is ah easy way to com, bine your talent, effort, and fi, nances with someone you know and, trust. One of Arizona’s biggest, and best-known businesses has, been run for 35 years by two part, ners who have nothing in writing, and just sort of grew up together,, but we wouldn’t recommend such, a loose arrangement., We’ve found that, generally, speaking, whenever one or more, persons get together and share, profits, share losses, and have, equal rights over the control and, management of a business, the, law will regard them as partners,, whether or not they have agreed, brally or in writing to call them, selvps partners., StonetijTies unforseen consequ, ences’ *you have to keep in mind, in forming a general partnership, is ; that each partner is responsi, ble for the debts incurred by the, other in connection with the busi, ness. What’s more, under certain, circumstances you might be held, responsible in damages for acts, of your partner committed in the, course of your joint business., A partnership may be dissolved, at any time by any one of the, partners; where you withdraw in, violation of the terms of the part, nership agreement you may be li, able for damages. Death or bank, ruptcy of a partner are other, causes of dissolution., The important thing is to clear, ly understand what you are get, ting into, and what your responsi, bilities and liabilities are to be if, things do not go well., (This legal column is issued, under supervision of the State Bar, of Arizona, and is written to in- <, form, not to advise.) i, SUPPORT |, NAA C P 1, CLEANERS & TAILORS, change tlnublr-breaeled^^^^^^, Harry “ Rheams, «A.PPV!

Importance of the, license is that it insures the, animal has been inoculated against, rabies., According to William J. Feld, meier, acting county finance di, rector, funds have been set aside, in the budget for the next fiscal, year to double the personnel of, the humane department to carry, on the probe., The door-to-door campaign will, begin as soon as the new person, nel can be lined up, a county hu, mane officer said., Dog licenses issued so far this, i year have dropped. The reason is, that most veterinarians have re, fused to issue dog licenses since, Jan. 1. In the past veterinarians, have issued the dog licenses for, the county and collected a $1.50, fee., This year they sought an in, crease in the fee which the county, could not pay. State law prevents, charging a higher fee., The license fee for female dogs, is $5.00 and for male is $2.50., Lack of licenses is given for the, fact that the humane department, has not been self-supporting. This, l is the first year it hasn’t supported, itself, according to Mr. Feldmeier., He said the door-to-door cam, paign will more than pay for it, self with the additional revenue, from licenses it will bring in., And it will assure that dogs are, being properly vaccinated against, rabies. An epidemic is possible, anytime when it is assumed that, some 14,000 unvaccinated dogs are, loose. :, The maximum penalty for fail, ure to obtain a dog license is S3OO, fine and a six months jail term., Dog owners should have obtain-, I ed licenses by last March.

It pointed out, that cyclists will enjoy using sec, ondary roads with their relatively, light traffic leads rather than bat, tle the congestion choking primary, traffic arteries during the four-day, weekend., The Institute noted that the bike, is a venicle and as such is entitled, to be operated in the streets but, cautioned riders that all riding and, traffic rules applicable to motor, ists also apply to the two-wheeler, There are currently more than, 27 million bikes in the hands of the, American public, the Institute said,, with approximately 55 million per, sons who enjoy riding throughout, the year.

Beginning with 1948,, When Negroes lived in two major, areas in Phoenix, the article, traces the growth of subdivis, ions in . which Negro families, might purchase homes, as well, as the enlargement of those (, Phoenix areas where Negro, homes were located., “The first Negro to move West, (on Jefferson and Washington), Experienced considerable hostil, ity with garbage being dropped, in his back yard every night and, with some physical threats and, also with the general procedure, of a neighborhood petition.” The, article goes on to show the grad, ual acceptance of Negro families (, by their neighbors in many sec, tions of the city, but naturally, reports on the many areas of, great need in the problem ot, residential segreation., “Discrimination in Employ, ment,” by the same author, gives, the 1960 picture of employment of, Negroes in major industry, banks,, retail trade and departments of, the City of Phoenix and of Mari, copa County., Other timely and important ar, ticles are “The Need For A Pub, lic Accommodations Law” by Rev., Walter H. Dugan and “The Mex, ican-American in Phoenix” by, Manuel Pena. However each of, the ten articles tells the vital, and fascinating story of the striv, ing for human dignity and the, “guaranteed” rights by our, Phoenix minority groups and this, booklet should be a must on the, reading list of all Arizona resi, dents. The booklet is a non, profit venture and will be sold for, only $1 to allay the costs of pub, lication. It is available through, the mail at the following address;, Civic Unity, P. O.

The measure would cost, ■ $850,000,000 the first year. Arizona, ■ would receive $21.80 for each pu, pil of elementary and high school, ! age, or a total of $7,405,000 The, \' amount per state varies from $9.25, ’ per pupil (Connecticut) to $27.74, l (Arkansas, Mississippi and South, ! Carolina.) This measure passed, 1 the Senate in early June by a 49-, 34 vote, and comes to the House, floor soon., 1 As most people recognize, the, bill now pending is not the first, I federal enactment intended to en-, I courage and support education., I Since 1785 Congress has passed, s more than 160 different school aid, ‘ laws including:, 1. School Section Grants. In the, ; early days of the republic Con, gress granted Section 16 in each, r township to the states for school, E purposes. Arizona has its “school, t sections.”, 2. Land Grant Colleges. The Mor, - rill Land Grant Act of 1862 gave, 3 each state 30,000 acres of public, f land to support colleges like Ari, , zona State University and the Uni, f versity of Arizona., 3. Vocational Training. Since 19-, 17 nearly every Arizona high school, - has received funds to aid agri, - cultural and vocational training., 4. School Lunch Program. Ari, - zona school in 1959-60 received, / $994,367 in federal funds to help, f with school lunch programs; in, 1 addition our children consumed, about $1,640,000 worth of surplus, i agricultural commodities,, r 5. G. I. Bill Several million, 5 World War II and Korean vets, » have received some sl4 billion in, - educational benefits under the G.I., - Bill program., r 6. Federal Impact Programs., - In 1950 Congress started a pro, i gram of grants to aid communi, ; ties hard hit by federal activities., , Arizona schools received more, s than $9,400,000 under this pro, gram in the last school year., 7. National Defense Education, Act. This was a 1958 bill sponsor, t ed by President Eisenhower to, i encourage scientific training. Ari, zona has declined to participate, in this program., In my study of this measure I, became curious about the amount, and kind of federal aid Arizona is, * presently receiving. As part o f, this homework I read last week, “Skipper” Dick’s 1959-60 financial, 1 report on Arizona school opera, ,l tions. This pamphlet will never, * be a best - seller, but it contains, n , interesting information for one, n willing to plough through. For, example, the average cost of edu, ‘‘ eating an elementary school pu, \'\' pil was $360 for the year; for a, high school student it was $606., t And the report makes it clear, that we already have a substan, c tial measure of federal aid to ed, !; ucation in Arizona. Our total, 1 school year effort was $106,625,-, 0 000, and this was borne by three, P levels of government in these pro, \' portions:, f : School Districts, „ and Counties $51,375,000 48 percent, , State $42,787,000 40 percent, *\' Federal Gov. $12,463,000 12 percent, )-, 1X Total $106,625,000, Thus nearly $1 of every 8 in, - our Arizona school budget al, ready comes from Uncle Sam., Be eensidetete of oihen, ff■ I j X, J 1 V ;t -y, Jr ____ I \\, B||* iXra 11, JL, “FOCUS ON AMERICA” studies archaeological, discoveries in Arizona in “SHARDS OF THE, AGES’’ on Tuesday, July 4 at 6:00 P.

The first was, George Washington, the second, John J. Pershing. Richard O’Con, nor’s latest book could well be, the definitive biography of the, latter., General Pershing’s career cover, ed many years and many battles,, battles fought against Indians., Moros, Spaniards, and the Axis, powers of World War I. Pershing, brought this experience and com, petence with him when he took, command of the army, and under, his leadership it strengthened and, prospered. He was neither an in, novator nor a firebrand, but he, was a professional soldier par exel, lence, and he did much to in, fluence the course of American, military history., Mr. O’Connor realizes, however,, that behind Pershing the military, hero was Pershing the man. Persh, ing had a deep, complex character, and resourcefulness, typified by, his steady rise from a fresh young, lieutenant to commander of the, American Expeditionary Force,, but he also had a warmth and, humor that often went unnoticed, under his austere exterior. These, characteristics were noted by- the, author, however, and the result, is an unusually perceptive bio, graphy., Richard O’Connor is an experi, enced fiction writer, and as a re, sult BLACK JACK PERSHING, reads more like a narrative than, a dissertation. This smoothness, does not denote lack of accuracy, or depth, as the book is obviously, well researched, but rather con, sideration for the reader. Mr. O’-, Connor also flavors his facts with, humor, a commodity too often, conspicuous by its absence in bio, graphies., John Troyer, 9 °?„^, 4341 E.

The, “passport” will be provided with, out charge to any Valley Bank, customer, with a satisfactory bank, ing relationship, planning an out, of-state business or vacation trip, If, for example, he should be in, New York City and desire help in, obtaining theatre tickets or the, name of a reliable garage, dentist, or hotel, he need only present his, “passport” to an officer of the, nearest Manhattan bank., “He’ll get red carpet treatment,”, says one Valley Bank promotional, man. “It’s an Open Sesame that, will magically open doors,” says, another. “It’s. a visa to new, vistas,” exclaimed a third., A less lyrical VNB official points, out that Valley Bank is one of the, best known in the nation in bank, ing circles; therefore, its new let, ter of introduction is certain to, prove “most helpful” anywhere, outside the Grand Canyon State., He noted, too, that Carl Bimson, also is president of the American, Bankers Association which num, bers more than 14,000 commercial, banks <9B per cent) among its, membership.
