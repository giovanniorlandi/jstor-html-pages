She was a very popular\nyoung woman, and especially -was sbe\na favorite of the young people of this\ncommunity. She was a leader in all\nsocial functions, and her company wasJ\neag erly sought.\nHer father, Mr. William Sanders,\nwas a native of England, was a skilled\npenman, and was a school teacher by\nprofession. He and another teacher,\nalso an EngliBhman, Daniel Booty,\ncame tO\'Columbia at the same -time,\nand entered upon their profession. It\nwas in the Mt.

He did not remain in this\nposition but a short time, resigning it\nto accept a position in Norton\'s Bank,\nwhich he held until his death, which\noccurred about twenty-five years ago.\n""\' As an artist, Miss Sanders had but\nfew equals.

Livingstone\nCOPYRIGHT 8Y LITTLE, BROWN, AND COMPANY.\ni\nA rich but universally respected\nwestern man Is murdered in hla\nautomobile. The crime is accom\nplished with such stealth that even\nthe chauffeur is not aware of It.\nSome months previously an eastern\nbusiness associate, but not an inti\nmate of the western man, had met\ndeath in an equally mysterious\nmanner. There is absolutely no\nclew to the murder and no apparent\nmotive for the second crime.\nBasil Santoine, a blind lawyer,\n-with that remarkable inner percep\ntion frequently developed by the\nsightless, while traveling on an\nesstbound train from Seattle in the\ncompany of his daughter and his\nconfidential secretary, Is murder\nously assaulted in his berth. Some\nfeatures of this assault are more\nmysterious than either of the other\ncrimes.\nThere is no superdetectlve nor\nscientific investigator to deduce in\nfallible theories fastening the guilt\nupon the right party or parties.\nPolice efforts are futile and suc\nceed only in fouling the trail, in\nvolving Innocent parties and in\ncreasing the complications. The\nonly tangible clews seem to point\nto one Philip Eaton, a mysterious\nyoung man, who was abpard the\ntrain. There is also a suspicion\nthat he may have been connected\nwith the murder of the rich man\nin Seattle.\nApparently against xll dictates of\nsense and safety, Eaton is made a\nguest In the sumptuous home of\nSantoine. Here the mystery deep\nens to an extraordinary degree and\nthe big queries arise: Who is Phil\nip Baton; what is the past of this\nstrange man; what intuition or rea\nsoning draws the blind man to kirn\nIn face of the danger of his pres\nence; In what way Is Eaton con\nnected with the sinister events\nwhich afterward occur in the San\ntoine home; what explanation is\nthere for the growing interest of\nHarriet Santoine in the man who\nIs believed to have made an at\ntempt upon her father\'s life?\nHere are mystery and romance\ndifferent from anything you ever\nhave encountered. The outcome of\nevents and solution of the mystery\nare as unexpected as anything you\npossibly can imagine.\nCHAPTER I\nA Financier Dies..\nGabriel Warden capitalist, railroad\n\' director, owner of mines and timber\nlands, at twenty a cow-puncher, at\nforty-eight one of the predominant\nmen of the Northwest coast paced\nwith quick, uneven steps the great\nwicker-furnished living room of his\nhome just above Seattle on Puget\nsound. Twice within ten minutes he\nhad used the telephone in the hall to\nreceive the same reply that the train\nfrom Vancouver, for which he had in\nquired, had come In and that the pas\nsengers had left the station.\nIt was not like Gabriel Warden to\nshow nervousness of any sort ; Hondo,\nthe Japanese doorman, who therefore\nhad found something strange In his\ntelephoning, watched him through the\nportieres vhich shut off the living\n"room from the hall.\nWarden turned suddenly and pressed\nthe 4?ell to call a servant. Hondo\nentered the room; he noticed then\nthat Warden\'s hand, which was still\nholding the watch before him, was\nshaking. .-.J?n3W -SSLiM-"\n"X young man who may, or may\nnot, give a name, will ask for me in\na few moments. He will, say he called\nby appointment. Take him at once\nto my smoking room, and I will see\nhim there.- I am going to Mrs. War\nden\'s room now."\nHe . went up the stairs, Hondo no\nticed, still absently holding his watch\nIn his hand.\nWarden controlled his nervousness\nbefore entering his wife\'s room. She\ntalked with him casually for a mo\nment or so before she even sent away\nher maid. When they were alone, she\nsuddenly saw that he had come to her\nto discuss some serious subject.\n"Cora," he said, when he had closed\nthe door after the maid, "I want your\nadvice on a business question."\n"A business question!" She was\ngreatly surprised. He was one "of\n, those men who believe all business\nmatters should be kept from their\nwives.\n"I mean It came to me through some\nbusiness discoveries."\n"And y6u cannot decide It for your\nself?\' "I had decided it" He looked again\nat his watch. "I had quite decided\nIt; but now It may lead to some\nresult which I have suddenly felt tha,t\nI haven\'t the right to decide entirely\n, for myself."\nWarden\'s wife for the first time felt\n, alarmed,\nYon mean it affects me directly?"\nHe seized "both her hands in his\nrand held her before him.\n. "Cora," , he said, "what would you\n-have me do if you knew I had found\nont.that a young" man a man who.\n.four or five years ago. had as -much to\nlive for as any man might had been\noutraged In every right by men who\nare my friends? WouIdynf\'f have rhe\n! fight the outfit for him? Or would\njrpu have me \'lie .down?\'\nShe stared at him with only pride\nthen; she was proud of his strength,\nof his ability to fight, of the power\nshe knew he possessed to force his\nway against opposition. "Why, you\nwould fight them!" \'\n"You want me to fight them?"\n"Of course."\n"No matter what It costs?"\nShe realized then that what he was\nfacing was very grave.\n"Cora," he said, "I didn\'t come to\nask your advice without putting this\nsquarely to you. If L go into this\nfight, I shall be not onfy an opponent\nto some of my present friends ; I shall\nbe a threat to them something they\nmay think It necessary o remove." .\nShe cried out, "You mean someone\nmight kill you?"\n"Should that keep me from going\nmr\nT5he hesitated. He went on : "Would\nyou have me afraid to (o a thing that\nought to he done, Cora?"\n"No," she said; "I would not."\n"All right, then. That\'s all I had\nto know now. The young man Is com\ning to see me tonight, Cora. Probably\nhe\'s downstairs. I\'ll tell you all I\ncan after I\'ve talked wltfi him."\nHe went directly downstairs; as heJ\npassed through the hall, the telephone\nbell rang. Warden himself answered\nit Hondo overheard Warden\'s end of\nthe conversation. Apparently the\nother person wished to see Warden at\nonce. Warden finished, "All right ; I\'ll\ncome and get you. Wait for me there."\nThen he hung up. .\nTurning to Hondo, he ordered his\ncar. Hondo transmitted the order and\nbrought Warden\'s coat and cap; then\nHondo opened the house door for him\nand the door of the limousine, which\nhad been brought under the porte\ncochere. The chauffeur; was Patrick\nCorboy, a young Irishman who had\nbeen in Warden\'s employ for more\nthan five years; his faithfulness to\nWarden was never questioned. Cor\nboy drove to the place.

When this\nhad been established and further con\nfirmed by the doctor who was called,\nHondo and Mrs. Warden looked\naround for the young man but he\nwas no longer there.\nThe news of the murder brought ex\ntras out upon the streets of Seattle,\nTacoma and Portland at ten o\'clock\nthat night. Seattle, stirred at once at\nthe murder of one of its most promi\nnent citizens, stirred still further at\nthe new proof that Warden had been\na power in business and finance; then,\nas the second day\'s dispatches from\nthe larger cities came in, It stirred a\nthird time at the realization for so\nmen said that this was the second\ntime such a murder had happened.\nWarden had been what was called\namong men of business and finance\na member of the "Latron crowd"; he\nhad been close, at one time, to the\ngreat western capitalist Matthew La\ntron; the properties in which he had\nmade his wealth, and whose direction\nand administration had brought him\nthe respect and attention of other men,\nhad been closely allied with or even\nIncluded among those known as the\n"Latron properties"; and Latron, five\nyears before, had been murdered. La\ntron\'s murderer had been a man who\ncalled upon him by appointment, and\nWarden\'s murderer, it appeared, had\nbeen equally known to him, or at least\nequally recommended. Of this as\nmuch was made as possible in the sug\ngestion that the same agency was be\nhind ihe two.\nTlie .statements of Hondo and Cor\nboy were verified ; it was even\nlearned at what spot Warden\'s mur\nderer had left the motor unobserved\nby Corboy. Beyond this, no trace was\nfound of him, and the disappearance\nof the young man who had come to\nWarden\'s house and waited there for\nthree quarters of an hour to see him\nwas also complete.\nffiL.UlMK7CiS T\nV\naMMMW ! mw MMir"iHUJBBg\n4\nINTERNATIONAL MOTOR TRU\nk,i\nAs They Stopped, a Yrung Man of\nLess Than Medium Height, Broad\nshouldered, and .Wearing a Mackin\ntosh, Came to the Curb and Spoke\nto Warden.\nman of less than medium height,\nbroad-shouldered, and wearing a\nmackintosh, came to tlie curb and\nspoke to Warden.

The\nchauffeur did this, but vas obliged on\nthe way to come to a complete stop\nseyeral times, as he met street-cars or\nother vehicles on intersecting streets.\nAlmost immediately after Warden\nhad left the house, the doorbell rang\nand Hondo answered It. A young man\nwith a quiet and pleasant bearing in\nquired, for Mr. Warden and said he\ncame by appointment Hondo ushered\nhim into the smoking roam, where the\nstranger waited. In about forty min\nutes, Corboy drove the car under the\nporte-cochere again and got down and\nopened the door. There was no mo\ntion Inside the limousine.

A\n5wop of people, who evidently had\ncne to tho station in covered cars,\ns!5rxwded out to the gate and lined up\n-fa z"3&s old Sammy. The gateman\nssai2iitened Importantly and scrutl--.sea\n-each person presenting a ticket.\n\'SJomery inspected with attention the\ntSSie at the gate and watched old Sam\nsotalso as each passed him.\nTSie first in line was a girl a girl\nreOTft twenty-two or three, Connery\njJfisEed. "She had the easy, interested\nJ$S: of a person of assured position.\n"WStfcan Connery first saw her, she\nsfczned to be accompanying the man\n-vtSMtroow was behind her; but she of\nzStereS?

His eyes were hidden\nTJSvsmoked glasses such as one wears\nzdtgalnst a glare of snow.\nOcmnery found his gaze following\n"ejfc&i man ; the conductor did not know\n95m, nor had old Sammy recognized\n2Slm; but both were trying to place\nttdm- He, unquestionably, was a man\natebe imown, though not more so than\ndxaay who traveled In the transcontl\nsawetal trains l\nT \' A trim, self-aSjiured man of thirty\nhis open overcoa\'t showed a cutaway\nunderneath came past next, proffer\ning the plain Seattle-Chicago ticket.\nAn Englishman, with red-veined\ncheeks, fumbling, clumsy fingers and\ncurious. Interested eyes, Immediately\nfollowed.\nThe remaining man, carrying his\nown grips, set them down In the gate\nand felt In his pocket for his transpor\ntation. This person had appeared suddenly\nafter the line of four had formed In\nfront of old Sammy at the gate; he\nhad taken his place with them only\nafter scrutiny of them. His ticket\nwas a strip which originally had held\ncoupons for the Pacific voyage and\nsome Indefinite journey In Asia be\nfore; unlike the Englishman\'s and\nhis baggage did not bear the pasters\nof the Nippon Yusen Kalsha the\nticket was close to the date when It\nwould have expired, ft bore upon the\nline where the purchaser signed, the\nname "Philip D. Eaton" In plain, vig\norous characters without shading or\nflourish.\nAs a sudden eddy of the gale about\nthe shed blew the ticket from old\nSammy\'s cold fingers, \'the young man\nstooped to recover it. The wind blew\noff his cloth cap as hi did so, and as\nhe bent and straightened before old\nSammy, the old man suddenly gasped ;\nand while the traveler pulled on his\ncap, recovered his ticket and hurried\ndown the platform t(4 the train, the\ngateman stood staring after him as\nthough trying to recall who the man\npresenting himself ns Philip D. Eaton\nwas.\nConnery stepped besftle the old man.\n"Who Is It, Sammy?\' he demanded.\n"Who?" Sammy repeated. His eyes\nwere still fixed on the retreating fig\nure. "Who? I don\'t Unow."\nThe gateman mumbled, repeating\nto himself the names ,of the famous,\nthe great, the notorious, In his effort\nto fit one to the mai who had just\npassed. No one else belated and\nbound for the Eastern Express was In\nsight. The president\'s order to the\nconductor and" to the dispatcher sim\nply had directed that Number Five\nwould run one hour late ; it must leave\nIn five minutes; and Connery, guided\nby the impression the man last\nthrough the gate had made upon him\nand old Sammy both, had no doubt\nthat the man for whom the train had\nbeen held was now on board.\nConnery went out to the train. The\npassengers who had been parading the\nplatform had got aboard; the last five\nto arrive also hfid disappeared Into the\nPullmans, and their luggage had been\nthrown Into the baggage car. Connery\njumped aboard.\nThe three who had passed the gate\nfirst the girl, the man with the\nglasses and the young man In the cut\naway It had now become clear were\none party. They had had reservations\nmade, apparently, In \' the name of\nDome; the girl\'s address to the spec\ntacled man made plain that he was\nher father; her name, apparently, was\nHarriet; the young man In the cut\naway coat was "Don" to her and\n"Avery" to her father. His relation,\nwhile intimate enough to permit him\nto address the girl as "Harry," was\nunfailingly respectful to Mr. Dome;\nand against them both Dome won his\nway; his daughter was to occupy the\ndrawing room; he and Avery were to\nhave sections in the open car.\n"You have Sections One and Three,\nsir," the Pullman conductor told him.\nAnd Dome directed the porter to put\nAvery\'s luggage in Section One, his\nown in Section Three.\nThe Englishman was sent to Section\nFour in Car Three the next car for\nwardand departed at the heels of\nthe porter. Connery watched more\nclosely, as now it came the turn of the\nyoung man whose ticket bore the\nname of Eaton. Eaton had no reser\nvation in the sleepers; he appeared,\nhowever, to have some preference as\nto where he slept.\n"Give me a Three, if you have one."\nhe requested of the Pullman conduc\ntor. Bis voice, Connery noted, was\nwell modulated, rather deep, distinct\nly pleasant At sound \'of it, Dome,\nwho with his daughte\'s help was set\ntling himself in his section, turned and\nlooked that way and said something\nin a low tone to the girl. Harriet\nDome also looked, and with her eyes\non Eaton, Connery saw her reply in\naudibly, rapidly and at some length.\n"I can give you Three -Jn Car Three,\nopposite the gentleman I Just as\nsigned," the Pullman conductor of\nfered. "That\'ll do very well." Eaton an\nswered in the same pleasant voice.\nAs the porter now took his bags,\nEaton followed him out of the car.\nConnery went after them Into the next\ncar. He expected, rather, that Eaton\nwould at once identify himself to him\nas the passenger to whom President\nJarvls\' short note had referred. Ea\nton, however, paid no attention to him,\nbut was busy taking off his, coat and\nsettling himself In his section as -Connery\npassed.\nThe conductor, willing that Eaton\nshould choose his own time for iden\ntifying himself, passed slowly on, look\ning over the passengers as he went\nHe stood for a few moments in con\nversation with the dining-car conduc\ntor; then he retraced his way through\nthe train. He again passed Eaton,\nslowing so that the young man could\nspeak to him If he wished, and even\nhalting an Instant to exchange a word\nwith the "Englishman; but Eaton al\nlowed him to pass on "without speak\ning to him. Connery\'s step quickened\nas he entered the next car on his way\nback to the smoking compartment of\nthe observation car. whee he expect\ned to compare sheets wlthfhe Pnil-\niqani conductor beio.-ia\'nTi\'Sa\'e\ntickets. As hevehtSrtR\nuiiuu ,\never, Avery sti\n"Give Me a Three, If You Have One,"\nHe Requested of the Pullman Conductor.\n"Mr. Dome would like to speak to\nyou," Avery said.\nConnery stopped beside the section,\nwhere the man with the spectacles sat\nwith his daughter. Dome looked up\nat him.\n"You are the train conductor?" he\nasked.\n"Yes. sir," Connery replied.\nDome fumbled in his inner pocket\nand brought out a card-case, which\nhe opened, and produced a card. Con\nnery, glancing at the card while the\nother still held It, saw that it was\nPresident Jarvls visiting card, with\nthe president\'s name In engraved\nblock letters; across its top was Writ\nten briefly In Jarvls\' familiar hand.\n"This is the passenger"; and below,\nIt was signed with the same scrawl\nof Initials which had been on the note\nConnery had received that morning\n"H. R. J."\nConnery\'s hand shook as, while try\ning to recover himself, he took the\ncard and looked at it more closely,\nand he felt within him the sinking\nsensation which follows an escape\nfrom dnnger. He saw that his too\nready and too assured assumption\nthat Eaton was the man to whom Jar\nvls\' note had referred, had almost led\nhim Into the sort of mistake which is\nunpardonable in a "trusted" man; he\nhad come within an ace, he realized,\nof speaking to Eaton and so betray\ning the presence on the train of a\ntraveler whose journey his superiors\nwere trying to keep secret.\n"You need, of course, hold the train\nno longer," Dome said to Connery.\n"Yes, sir; I received word from Mr.\nJarvis about you, Mr. Dome. I shall\nfollow his instructions fully."\nAs he went forward again after the\ntrain was under way, Connery tried\nto recollect how it was that he had\nbeen led into such a mistake, and de\nfending himself, he laid it all to old\nSammy. But old Sammy was not\noften mistaken In his Identifications.\nIf Eaton was not the person for whom\nthe train was held, might he be some\none else of importance? Now as he\nstudied Eaton, he could not Imagine\nwhat had made him accept this pas\nsenger as a person of great position.\nIt was only when he passed Eaton a\nthird time, half an hour later, when\nthe train had long left Seattle, that\nthe half-shaped hazards and guesses\nabout the passenger suddenly sprang\nInto fomi.

"He gave his name on\nhis ticket as Philip D. Eaton, sir,"\nConnery replied.\n"Is that all you know about him?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"If you find out anything about him,\nlet me know," Dome bade.\n"Yes, sir." Connery determined to\nlet nothing interfere with, learning\nmore of Eaton; Dome\'s request only-,\ngave him added responsibility.\nDome, however, was not depending\nupon Connery alone for further Infor\nmation. As soon as the conductor\nhad gone, he turned back to his\ndaughter and Avery upon the seat op\nposite. "Avery," he saldin a tone of direc\ntion, "I wish you to get in conversa\ntion with this Philip Eaton: It will\nprobably be useful if you let Harriet\ntalk with him too.

"It is very serious reflection\nthat the United States, the great\noriginative nation, should re\nmain contented with negation.\nArmistice is a negation, it iB a\nstandstill of arms; it is a cessa\ntion of fighting and we are so\nbent on a cessation of fighting\nthat we are even throwing our\narms away.\n"It is a singular circumstance,\nthat to which Mr. Morgenthau\nhas, in part, adverted, but while\nwe prescribed the conditions of\nthe armistice, we did not concur\nin the establishment of perma\nnent peace. That, of course,\nwas brought by a group in the\nUnited States Senate, who pre\nferred personal, partisan motive\nto the honor of their country and\nthe peace of the world.\n"They do not represent the\nUnited States because the Unit\ned States is moving forward and\nthey are slipping backward.\nWhere this slipping will end,\nGod only will determine.\nArmistice and Peace.\n"And I have also been reflect\ning upon the radical difference\nbetween armistice and peace.\nArmistice, as I have said, is a\nmere negation It is the refrain\ning from force. But peace is a\nvery positive and constructive\nthing as the world stands now\nadays, because it must be\nbrought about by the systematic\nmaintenance of common under\nstanding and by cultivation not\nby amiable phrases, buc the ac\ntive cooperation for justice is a\ngreater thing than any kind of\nexpediency. America has al\nways stood for justice and al\nways will stand for it." Puny\npersons who are standing in the\nway presently find that their\nweakness is no match ior the\nstrength of a moving Providence\n"If you wjll pardon an invalid\nfor putting on his hat I will\npromise riot to talk through it.\n"I think then we may renew\ntoday our faith in the future\nthough we are celebrating the\npast. The future is in our hands\nand if we are not equal to it, the\nshame will be ours and none\nothers I thank you from a very\nfull heart, my friends, for this\ndemons tracion of kindness by\nyou and bid you and the nation\nr-Godspeed."\nLong And Short Of it.\nBY BURKE.\nThat whatever Fashion says\nso women believe.

While we are\n-some nearer the belt of eternal\nsummer and farther away from\ntthe everlasting ice of the North\nole, than your state, land while\n-\' JE have at various times called at\nt;eotion to the mildness of our\ncitmate and the common condi\ntions manifested in vegetation,\nifchat point to ends desirable, yet\n- 3! am, each time, reminded that\nsimilar conditions prevail in Co-\n- Hombfa and Adair county. When\n3Tou picture the beauty of au\nTtumn flowers; the ripening of\nHoscious fruits, just before the\ndawn of Christmas times, it al\nmost makes me feel that I have\njgained nothing by seeking a\nl warmer clime in leaving Adair\nsmd stakine my claims here. I\niam truly glad to know that a\nclimatic change a softening of\ntfae region of winter and a cor\nresponding lengthening of warm\ntar days and fruitf ulness is na\nfxtresgif t to my old homeland.\nI3ay the Cherries continue to" rip\nen, through t&e entire winter, to\nmatoes, Jiome- grown, be abun\ndarftf, Hieflower!s aweet odor3 be\ncrafted on. every breeze and the\n""smisic from the birds be with Co-\n. umbis and Adair county the en-\nitice year, be realized as now in-\ndicafed, is my sincere wish.\n. Scich conditions would bring to\nimind an approximate idea and\nappreciation of the blessings of\nraal Dixie. Preparations for a\niLargsr acreage for all the prod\nacts produced in this country are\ni&eing made. Especially is this\nitrLe as to cotton. The North\nearn Snan does not readily take\n&o1d of cotton, but when the\niprice reaches 20 td 25 cents for\ncniddling.he yields and this being\nirae, I find nearly all who have\nlocated here, in thelast few\n;years, are preparing for a big\ntnrop. The. -best prices, save war\ntime conditions, are now paid\n.and the evidence that cotton will\nibring around the same\'price an\nother year is shown in the fact\nttbatthis country will not have\nanj surplus to carry over and\nworld -supply is not above actual\njneeds. Every body is feeling\nigood over present conditions and\ntfoture prospect. We need more\nactual farmers and when the\narge plantations are cut into\nsmall farms and intelligently op\nerated we will have the prover\nbial land that flows with milk\n;and honev. The producers of\ncotton are organizing a pool for\nttfre next crop. This organiza\ntion is along the line of the to\nIjaceopool. I have signedrnot\n33 a real cotton man, but to show\nany faith in what I haver long\npreached get together and stay\ntogether. When the producer\n(becomes the master of his prod\ntact lie may expect1 an improve\nment in his condition. The br\n\' ederly marketing of any product\ni fcheafety valve against, vio\nlent fluctuations while the law\nof supply and demand fixes sale\nprices. I am glad that Adair\ncounty farmers have finally ac\nceftted this great principle that\nmeans atlf protection and not\ndestruction to others. I am de\nvoting my time to f asm improve\nments and trust to be. justified\nlater in better returns. Fencing\nis pretty costly, but I\' m at it and\nby and by hope to protect my al\nfalfa meadows from outside in\nterference, from mules and cat\ntle that are turned loose to graze\nafter the crops are gathered.\nWe have a stock law, but I dis\nlike to enforce it, I put in large\ncypress corner and gate posts\nand the holes are dug four feet\ndeep and still it is black dirt fur\nther down.\nThis being Thanksgiving times\nI am reminded of many blessings\ncommon to us all. Generally\nwe spend the appointed day by\nattending worship or by indulg\ning in a sumptuous feast and in\nhaving pleasure in many other\nways and fail to take stock of\nour many, many blessings and in\nlike manner fall short of giving\nour real thanks to the Creator or\nto give cheer and comfort to less\nunfortunate ones whose real\ngood we desire. Why any Amer\nican, any citizen of the U. S. A.,\nshould fail to appreciate our great\ncountry a land of wonderful\nresources, can not be explained\nif there be such an one. Like\nwise, in our government is the\nbest in the world. From whence\ncame these blessings and who is\nso ungrateful and unmindful as\nnot to really appreciate them?\nNo other people are similarly\nblessed. The freest government\nin the world, founded on the will\nof the people, it came into exist\nence through sacrifices, of stag\ngering costs of life an(l treasure\nand has been maintained through\nevery crisis. It came from\' the\nWorld War with unstained rep\nutation after performing its duty\nregardless of cost. It , holds the\npurestrings of the world and\nhas an over "abundance of every\nthing needed. From the after\neffects of war, business suffered\nand values declined but the sea\nson of discontent and discomfort\nwas short. Again our cpuntry\nis prospered and the great body\nof people content and moving on\nas before the dreadful conflict.\nIn addition to these conditions,\npeace within and peace without,\nwith bountiful crops, a patriotic\ncitizenship, good schoots and fine\nchurches we should thank the\ngreat Creator from the depth of\nour heart. Again our neighbors\nand our friends, those who sur\nround us and those in other lo\ncalities are blessings, whose real\nworth can not be estimated. Our\npersonal blessings of health and\nthe entire family circle are im\nmeasurable.7 Fam indeed thank\nful. I have reason to be even\nmore than I am. If we would all\ncount out, blessings one by one\nt\nhow impossible for us to express\na proper appreciation of them.\nWith best will and good wishes\nfor my many old friends, now\nenjoying the sweet fragrance of\nautumnal flowers ancj luscious\nfruits\' that still linger or reap\npear in \'my old homeland of\nAdair, I close. - .,\nC.
