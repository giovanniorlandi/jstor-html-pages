It is not generally known that Tonopah is\none of the most favorably situated cities in the universe for con\ntrolling a-water supply that must, always remain free from\ncontamination.1 The sources of the supply1 are the highest mountain\nranges of the southeastern country, \'remote-from habitations and\nnaturally free from all contamination. There is not another, city\non the Pacific coast with the same advuatages and there is not\nanother city on the coast that would not exchange with alacrity\nits present quality of water for that possessed by Tonopah.\nIn the first place the water supply is drawn through underground\nchannels from nature\'s own distillery. In the course of a long\nfiltration through scores of miles of subterranean . meandering the\nwater is purified and clarified as could not be done through the\napplication of the most complete process for removing bacterial\ngrowths. There is not a Bingle one of the large cities that is not\npuzzled with the problem of how to take care of its water system\nin such a manner as to destroy the deadly germs assembled in the\nnatural progress of the streams from \'their fountainheads. The\nsupply of the national capital is about the worst on the continent,\nand the records of the chief centers between the Atlantic and\nPacific show by their monthly reports of -typhoid infection - the\npresence of noxious germs that carry disease and death into many\nhouseholds. Who ever heard of a case of typhoid fever contracted\n. in Tonopah! The number is so small and the deaths so rare\nthat the quantity establishes-almost a negligible mortality from\nthis source. When it is said that the Potomac is an open sewer\nthe same remark may be applied with equal force to the Ohio,\nMississippi, Missouri, St. Lawrence and almost every other American\nriver because they are the. sewers and the source of water supply\nfor nearly all the cities located on their banks. These cities show\na marked prevalence of typhoid fever, thus confirming what has\nbeen said over and over again, that this disease, as also cholera,\ndysentery and intestinal diseases can\' be carried from one town to\nanother by interior waterways. Indeed, the . question is one of\nextreme interest even to the residents along the Great Lakes, the\n- basins of which, according to the census reports, form the most\ndensely populated area of the United States. We know that large\ncities such as Buffalo. Erie, Cleveland, Milwaukee and Detroit\ndischarge their sewage into the lakes and we also know how Chicago\nand Cleveland suffered from typhoid fever visitations by contami\nnating their own water supplies. It is also A well known fact that\nmany of the river cities were obliged to resort to purification of\ntheir water supplies in order to arrest, the ever increasing .typhoid\nfever wave.\nThe available statistics, in spit of the many factors concerned\nin the dissemination of typnoid iever, conclusively show that the\nwater supply plays the most important role in the spread of the\ndisease. A summary of the typhoid fever death rates is here given\nFour cities using ground water from large wells 18.1\nEighteen cities using impounded and conserved rivers.!\'..;. 18.5\nEight cities UBlng water from small lakes . ..\'..::.19.S\n\' Seven cities using water from the Great "Lakes....! ; .32.8\nFiva cities using both surface and underground water ... 45.7\nNineteen cities using polluted river water- -...61.1\nTonopah belongs to the class mentioned in the first paragraph\nand its remarkable immunity from germ diseases .may be ascribed\nto the purity of the water supply.\nNEVADA AS A SUGAR STATE\nTIIE short sighted farmers of Churchill county are. not particu\nL larly keen about subscribing to contracts for the planting of\nsugar beets during the ensuing year. The new owners of the sugar\nfactory ask growers to guarantee 4000 acres of fmgar; beets. Less\nthan 40 per cent of the required amount has been signed up and it\nbegins to look as though Fallon would be deprived of an infant\nindustry that gave promise of a lusty manhood. To lose this sugar\nfaetory at this primal stage of agriculture development would be\nnothing short of a calamity that would set Nevada back 20 years\nin farm development. The sugar beet is peculiarly adapted to the\nsoil under the Lahontan project, since it thrives most luxuriantly\nin soil carrying a small percentage of alkali to impair its value for\nalfalfa. The advantage of subscribing to the BUgar contracts has\nbeen depicted by the best agriculture writers and lecturers, who\nhave devoted considerable time to convincing the people of Churchill\ncounty that their best interests parallel those of the men who have\nsubscribd to the capital stock of the sugar company.\nsAt this time, when the people , of Nevada are enlisted in\nmovement for a preferential campaign to boost Nevada products\nit should be borne in mind that home made beet sugar occupies\nan important place in the economic scale. In the case of beet sugar\nan unwarranted prejudice has obtained in the minds of many\nhousewives that it is not the equal of the cane article for preserving\nand other purposes. This opinion has not only prevailed in Nevada,\nbut in some other of the older beet BUgar states, and color has been\ngiven to this by many local grocers who have encouraged buyers\nto purchase cane sugar. In California, a few years ago, the question\nbecame a state widn Uu, and in order to test the relative merits of\nthd two sugars exhaustive experiments were made under the direc\ntion of Prof. O. W. Shaw, a noted and recognized specialist on\nsugar.

SEPTEMBER 8, 1916\nPAGE THREE\nMANHATTAN SHOWS\nBIG IMP ROVEUENT\nceases and the almost Inconceivably\nlow cost of 45 cents a ton hag been\nreached on ore that plates $2.10 and\nleaves 40 cents in the tails. There\nIs an enormous tonnage of commer\ncial ore which will be extracted and\ntreated at the rate of 400 tons a day.\nIt is probable that the mill on the\nBig Four will be remodeled to be a\ntwin of the Big Pine. This latter\nproperty Ig also under lease to\nMessrs. Wittenberg and Mushett.\nThey recently made a milling of 65\ntons that ran $40 a ton.\nThe trip to the Train-Chase lease\non the Mustang was one of great\ninterest. The tributers, S. B. Chase\nand Percy Train, have a year and a\nhalf left to extract ore. Recently\nthey . milled 200 tons that ran from\n$72 to $98. They have now 100 tons\nof even better grade rady for the\nmill. The shaft is now down 225 feet,\ngiving a vertical depth of 125 feet.\nSome magnificent cab\'net specimens\nmay be obtained from the bottom of\nthis shaft. The ore occurs In calcite\nand talc and Ig in pipes or chimneys.\nBy Wm. McClure Gotwaldt\nThe regeneration of Manhattan is\nat hand. The indices are to be found\nin the huge discoveries In the White\nCaps, in the development of the\nMustang by the operations of the\nTrain-Chase lease. In the building of\nthe Putney mill, In the operations of\nthe Salsberry properties, in the re\nsumption of operations in mill and\nmine on the Big Pine and Big Four,\nand in a half score of other under\ntakings of merit.\nBut one of the most important sign\nboards of the times is that of the\nUnion Amalgamated, stock in which\nwill shortly be listed on the New\nYork Curb and the San Francisco\nMining and Slock Exchange. It is a\ncomiJiiny incorporated in 1915, con\ngoliduting the Manhattan Litigation\nHill Merger company, the Manhattan\nAmalgamated Mining company, the\nManhattan Earl Mining company, all\ncontiguous, together with outside\nacreage of Very proinlHing character\nCharles F. Wittenberg is the presi\ndent of the company and Its control\nlug factor, having, made not only a\nheavy original Investment, but\' has\nfinanced the company through Its ex\nperimental and development stages.\nJames Fortnan Is vice president;\nCharles T. Olney, secretary, and the\nadditional directors are Hugh H.\nBrown and Arthur Raycraft. L. L.\nMushett, the superintendent, devotes\nhis waking, and what should be a por\ntion of his Bleeping hours, to direct\ning operations, giving to this task\nthe best of his ability and conscien\ntious care.\nThe entire acreage is In the ore\nzone on the chief Cambrian lime belt,\nwhich extends for 4500 feet along\nthe lode. The main ore bodies in\nLitigation Hill are In shattered lime,\nrather on the fault planes, from\nwhich they enter the lime. The hill\narises in a southerly direction from\nthe point of intersection of Dublin\nand White Caps gulches and this is\nthe general trend of the Cambrian\nlime until it eoinea in contact with\nthe Devonian limes , ou the upper\nreaches of the mountain.\nRunning easterly and westerly\nacross the lower portion of the hill,\nwhich 1b covered by the locations of\nthe Union Amalgamated Mining com\npany, there are a series of faults\nshoving the Cambrian lime into con\ntact with lime shale. They have\nbeen subjected to secondary enrich\nment, practically all of which Is gold.\nEight of these fault plane veins were\nexamined and In all there were pay\npannlngs secured. In pluces the veins\nare almost too narrow to be worked\nat profit, but in others that may be!\nstoped to a width or ten feet, all\ncommercial grade.\nThe Bath abaft, where operations\nare now centered, is an Incline of\napproximately 40 degrees. It is 500\nfeet deep and at the sump level there\nis the richest ore In the mine and in\npayable quantity.\nUntil a few months ago the ore\nbodies in the property were low\ngrade, the owners "Just getting by,"\nalthough they had mining and reduc\ntion costs reduced to about $5 a ton.\nLately,, however, as depth was ob\ntained and the formation so well un\nderatood that waste could be obviated\nand lurking . lenses brought to light,\ntha grade has been materially Un\nproved, while the available tonnage\nthat been enormously Increased. As\nnearly as the ore In sight can be\ndetermined, the result of innumerable\nassays, It will average $20 a ton.\nwhich should yield a profit of $15,\nto be diminished only by the amount\nof dead work that Is .undertaken.\nThere are three levels opened up\nand your correspondent prowled\nthrough all of them, with Borne diffi\nculty, especially where work has been\nimpended for some time and there\nhid been considerable caving. The\nlnses In each seem to have been\nmerely touched.\nThe company lum a comulute and\nclosely extracting mill.

(a) The railroads will, effective Septemberi, 1916,\'\nkeep the time of all men represented in this movement,\nupon an 8 hour basis and by separate account,, monthly,\nwith each man, maintain a record of the difference\nbetween the money actually earned by him on the\npresent basis and the amount that would have been\nearned upon an 8 hour basis ,overtime on each basis\nto be computed pro rata.\nThe amounts so shown will be subject to the\ndecision of the Commission, provided for in Paragraph\n(c) of this memorandum and payable in money, as\nmay be directed by said Commission in its findings and\ndecision.\n(b) The Interstate Commerce Commission to\nsupervise the keeping of these account s and report the\nincreased cost of the 8 hour basis, after such period of\nactual experience as their judgment approves or the\nPresident may fix, not, however, less than three\nmonths.\n(c) In view of the far-reaching consequences of the\ndeclaration made by the President, accepting the\n8 hour day, not only upon the railroads and the classes\nof labor involved directly in this controversy, but to\nthe public and upon all industry, it seems plain that\nbefore the existing conditions are changed, the whole\nsubject in so far as it affects the railroads and their\nemployees, should be investigated and determined by\na Commission to be appointed by the President, of\nsuch standing as to compel attention and respect to\nits findings. The judgment of such a Commission\nwould be a helpful basis for adjustments with labor\nand such legislation as intelligent public pinion, so\nr l J J\nlniormea, migm aemana.\nStatement of Executives to the President\nIn submitting this proposal to the President, the fifty railroad executives called to\nWashington and representing all the great arteries of traffic, made this statement to\nhim of their convictions:\nThe demands in this controversy have not been\npresented, in our judgment, for the purpose of fixing a\ndefinite daily period of labor, nor a reduction in the\nexisting hours of labor or change in methods of opera\ntion, but for the real purpose of accomplishing an\nincrease in wages of approximately One Hundred\nMillion Dollars per annum, or 3 5 per cent, for the men\nin railroad freight train and yard service represented\nby the labor organizations in this matter.\nAfter careful examination of, the facts and\' patient\nand continuous consultation with the Conference\nCommittee of Managers, and among ourselves, we\nhave reached a clear understanding of the magnitude\nof the questions, and of the serious consequences to\nthe railroads and to the public, involved in the decision\nof them. -\nTrustees for the Public,\nAs trustees for the public served by car lines and\nfor the great mass of the less powerful employees (not\nless than 80 per cent, of the whole number) interested\nin the railroad wage fund as trustees . also for the\nmillions of people that have invested their savings and\ncapital in the bonds and stock of these properties,\nand who thaugh the saving banks, trust companies\nand insurance companies, are vitally interested to the\nextent of millions of dollars, in the integrity and\nsolvency of the railroads of the country, we cannot in\nconscience surrender without a hearing, the principle\ninvolved, nor undertake to transfer the enormous cost\n: that will result to the transportation of the commerce\n" of the country.\nThe eight-hour day without punitfive overtime\ninvolves an annual increase, approximately, in the\naggregate of Sixty Millions of Dollars, a.id an increase\nof more than 20 per cent, in the paj of the\' men,\nalready the most highly paid in the, transportation\nservice.\nt\nThe ultimate cost to the railroadsnof an admission\nin this manner of the principle ufl,der contention\ncannot now be estimated; the effecU upon t\'he effi\nciency of the transportation of the country now\nalready under severe test under the 1 tide of business\nnow moving, and at a time when mom, instead iof less,\neffort is required for the public welfare, would be\nharmful beyond calculation.\nThe widespread effect upon the industries of tha\ncountry as a whole is beyond measure or appraise\nment at this time, and we agree with the insistent and\nwidespread public concern over the gravity of the\nsituation and the consequences of a surrender by the\nrailroads in this emergency.\nIn like manner we are deeply impressed with the\nsense of our responsibility to maintain and keep open\nthe arteries of transportation, which carry the life\nblood of the commerce of the country, and of the\nconsequences that will flow from even temporary\ninterruption of service over the railroads, but . the\nissues presented hare been raised above and beyond\nthe social and monetary questions involved, and\nthe responsibility for the consequences that may\narise will rest upon those that provoke it.\n1 Public Investigation Urged\nThe questions involved are in our respectful judg\nment, eminently suitable for the calm investigation\nand decision by the public through the agency of fair\narbitration, and cannot be disposed of, to the public\nsatisfaction, in any other manner.\nThe decision of a Commission or Board of Arbi\ntration, having the public confidence, will be accepted\nby the public, and the social and financial rearrange\nments made necessary thereby will be undertaken by\nthe public, but in no less deliberate nor orderly\nmanner.\nThe railroads\' of the country cannot under present\nconditions assume this enormous increase in their\nexpenses. If imposed upon them, it would involve\nmany in early financial embarrassment and bank\nruptcy and imperil the power of all to maintain\ntheir credit and the integrity of their securities.\nThe immediate increase in cost, followed by other\nincreases that would be inevitable, would substan\ntially appropriate the present purchasing power of\nthe railroads and disable them from expanding and\nimproving their facilities and equipment, to keep\nabreast of the demands of the country for efficient\ntransportation service.\nIn good faith we have \'worked\'continuously and earnestly in a sincere effort to\nsolve the problem in \'justice to all the parties at interest. These efforts were still\nin progress when the issuance of the strike order showed them to be unavailing.\nProblem Threatens Democracy Itself\nThe strike, if it comes, will be forced upon the country by the best paid\nclass of laborers in the wonld, at a\' time when the country has the greatest need\nfor transportation efficiency.\nThe problem presented is not that alone of the railroad or business world,\nbut involving democracy itself, and sharply presents the question whether any\ngroup of citizens should be allowed to possess the power to imperil the life\nof the country by conspiring to block the arteries of commerce.\nHALE HOLDBN,\nChieaf , Barlisjtea A Qaleey Sailrea.\nW.

Two\nnew world\' records were made hera\nwhen St. Frisco won the classic Char\nler 0k stake for 2:03 trotter after\nsix of the most exciting heat of light\nharness racing ever witnessed at\nCharter Oak park. The second heal\nwas declared a dead heat, tha time,\n2 : 07 V. displacing the world\' record\nset In 1904 on the Prlghton Beach\ntrack, Now York, when Sweet Marie\nand Arlato raced a dead heat In\n2:08H. The other record establlahed\nwas the fasteat six heat race, the\naverage time for the six heats being\n2;07V,\'. agalnat 2:07 19 24 set at Lex\nington, Ky In 1910, In a race won\nby Spanish Queen.\nAll throe events were fairly fast\nand close, but the Charter Oak event\nfurnished a thrill In every Ilnlah.\nLoss than half a head separated St.\nFrisco and Mabel Trask at the close\nof each heal. Mabel Trask took the\nfirst in smooth atyiw, but In the sec\nond I bey fought It out on even terms\nfrom the turn into the stretch to the\nwire and the Judge could not separ\nate them s they passed the aland.\nIn the third heat Alma Forbes and\nl.\'iramle Id set the pace for the\nfirst mile. St. Frisco and Mabel\nTrak went to the front on the far\nturn, but St. Frisco\'s effort to over\ncome Mabel Trask\' slight margin\nwas not sufficient. In the fourth heat\nthe veteran reinman. Goers, set the\npace. Mabel Trask coma not reacn\nhim before the wire. The fifth heat\nwas a repetition of the fourth, only\nfaster. It was only half a second\nslower than a world record for\nfifth heat, and the sixth also was only\nhalf a second behind the world\'s rec\nord time. In the last heat Mabel\nTrask made a game effort to pass\nthe bay stallion and did show In\nfront, but the burst of speed did not\nprove affective until just after St.\nFrisco\' head appeared under the\nIre.\nThe two year old trot was captured\nby Kunua McOowan in straight heats\nPittsburgh was the ciass of the seven\nstarters in the 2:14 trot, but owing to\na break at the start of the third heat\nwas forced to go a fourth heat to get\nthe decision.\nAMUSEMENTS\n(Or Aaaorlnlrd Prns.l\nHAMLINK, Minn., Sept. 8 Kid\nRiley, driven by Uoomls, won the 2:08\npate of the Great Western circuit\nraces.
