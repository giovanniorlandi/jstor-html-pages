Fulton of Reno,\nassistant general freight and passenger agent for the Southern\nPacific company, the only general officer of that great corporation\nthat Nevada evetvpqpsessed. You remember that back in the time of\nCollis P. Huntington that magnate stated that his road across\nNevada was "simply a bridge over a desert." It was somewhat\nlike the remark made by a railway king of early days, who\ndisgustedly exclaimed: "The public be damned."\nThank fortune, or whoever may be responsible, there are no more\nrailway despots of the sort as the two referred to. The railroads\nare standing in with the people and through Mr. Fulton most\nexceptionally. It was through his efforts that the Southern Pacific\ncompany deeded many miles of its abandoned right of way after\nthe cutoff had been built, to the various counties in Nevada through\nwhich it passed, in order that they might have highways of uniform\ngrade and easy curvature.\nMr. Fulton used his good offices and appealed to the higher\npowers to make it easy for auto travel across this state, realizing as\nhe must, that this would deduct from the passenger earnings of his\ncompany. He was working pro bono publico and his company\nhasn\'t lost anything except a few fares, for his actions have brought\nthe people and the corporation very closely together.\nAnd now comes Friend Fulton in another role as a Nevada\nbenefactor, placing . his employer in second consideration. He\nconfers with the Bonanza with reference to a forage plant that\nmight be experimented with in southern Nevada for the purpose of\nsecuring a winter feed for livestock. In its ignorance, but good\n, purposefulness, this paper suggested to him the planting of\nalfilerilla. This is a shrub that sends down a deep tap root and\nmakes a mat on the surface, thus not merely seeking moisture from\nthe depths, but conserving it on the surface. Mr. Fulton has taken\nt up the matter and will report progress to the Bonanza\'s readers.\nNow mark this point well, the Southern Pacific company secures\ngreat revenue through transporting beef cattle and sheep to Cali\nfornia every autumn when the alfalfa crop is short, as it is this year.\nIf the forage plant suggested proves what may be claimed for it,\nthen this transfer to California in the fall and back in the spring\nwill cease, thereby cutting the Southern Pacific off of considerable\nrevenue. But Mr. Fulton realizes and his company realizes and\nthe people of Nevada should realize that through the building of\ngood roads for autos and establishing of a system of winter feeding\nhere, population is increased and a huge industry is nurtured and\nin the long run the Southern Pacific company will be an enormous\ngainer by the transaction. Mr. Fulton\'s head is not only broad\nbut long.\nRI VISION OF MINING LAWS\nTHE American Mining congress, at its nineteenth annual session\nwhich opens in Hotel La Salle, Chicago, November 13th, will\nendeavor to definitely formulate the long sought for and long fought\nfor revision of the mining laws of the country.\nDr, Foster of Illinois, chairman of the house commitee on mines\nand mining, will be in attendance and will report on the actual\nprogress made on this subject by congress, giving the objections\nraised to many of the contemplated changes and his ideas as to\nwhat can be passed through both houses of congress.\nThe battle has been a long and hard one, but the American Mining\ncongress has a record of successes that marks it a great power for\nremedial good in the mining field east and west.\nThe first appeal made by the American Mining congress for a\nbureau of mines was backed by less than one-twelfth of the members\nof the house of representatives. But on May 16, 1910, the bill was\nsigned by the president, and on February 25, 1913, an amended bill\nwas signed covering more particularly the western situation.\nSince that time the efforts of the American Mining congress have\nbeen directed in part to secure adequate appropriations for the work\nof the bureau. And this struggle has been no easy one, but on the\nwhole extremely satisfactory.\nThe greatest work of the American Mining congress is, however,\nalong the lines of planning legislation which provides greater safety\nfor the lives of the men engaged in coal and metal mining operations.\nThe result of legislation initiated by the American Mining congress\nlias reduced by nearly one-half the number of men killed per million\ntons of coal produced. Acting on the humanitarian impulse created\nby this movement of the American Mining congress, the big organiza\ntions of the country have almost without an exception introduced\nthe splendid "Safety First" efforts which have been so productive\nof good results everywhere.\nOO IAST AND WEST, BUT ALSO GO DOWN\nSIMPLY, because the lode porphyry as hardheaded Cal. Brother\ncalls it, and more scientific people give it more learned names\nWas eut off about six hundred feet below the capping or overburden\nin several mines of Tonopah by an intrusion of dacite, didin \'t mean\nthat this marked the depth of possible enrichment. S. It Brady\ntheorized in this manner and he sent down an incline from the\nthousand level of the Belmont to an additional sixty feet of vertical\ndepth and dollar stock was sextupled in\' value. The dacite was\nmerely an intrusion and beneath it the ore bearing trachyte was\nfound. The Belmont today is sweetening its heads from the 1400\nlevel, the Bonanza is informed. Acting Superintendent Moore tells\nthis paper that he is enrichening his shipments from the deep winze\nof the Rescue. The Victor the other day, which is now a couple\nof hundred feet below the 1540, has cut twelve feet of commercial\nore in the shaft Other mines are going to great depth in the camp.\nThe AfteraU will be about 1900 feet when the crosscut gets under\nthe Umatilla shaft. No, there is no real scientific or practical reason\nHURRAY FER WILSON 1\nf yNLESS fraud should be palpable, a recount for the election to\nlJ the presidency would be not only expensive per se, but would\ninvolve great loss along other lines. The majority for Mr. Wilson\nappears to be decisive. Let him have the old chair if he won it\nand buy him a better one if he asks. The country Is rich enough.\nEastern bankers complain that they have too much gold for their\nown good, which may mean that they are faced with the dire\npossibility of being compelled to lower interest rates. Let him have\nthe chair and if it is uncomfortable, build him one out of the\nwatchful waiting plank and decorate it with the minatures of the\nhundreds of Americans who have been ruthlessly slain in Mexico\nand of the men, women and babies who have been murdered by U\nboats. Upholster it with his notes and ultimata. Then put British\ncensorship and prize court proceedings in his pipe and tell him to\nsmoke it in comfort. Meanwhile arrange for his delectation reports\nof the absolute lack of exports after the war and have the documents\nilluminated with pictures of smokeless factories and family reunions\nat Ellis island. Yes, make it comfortable for the benign old\npedagogue.\nJUST THINK, A WOMAN CONGRESSMAN!\nAW OMAN has been elected to the congress of the United States.\nThis marks the beginning of a new enoch.

Women are in niuny particulars man\'s inferior.\nboth physically and mentally, having less stature and a smaller\ncranium, but they are his inferior rather in quantity than in quality\nand the emancipation of the sex will assist in eliminating the\nphysical differentiation, while the lodgment for the cerebrum,\ncerebellum, medulla oblongata and whatever else machinery people\nhave in their heads, will be given room for expansion. Really, the\nBonanza has no intent to appear flippant in this matter.

The morning\npaper treat the speech of Chancellor\nvon Bethman Hollweg In the Reich\nstag vw terday as a document of the\nutmost importance in throwing light\non the responsibility for the war, the\ncharacter of peace and the subse\nquent political status of the world,\ngod Belgium In particular. What the\nImperial chancellor said concerning\nthe Russian imperial order authoriz\ning mobilization as equivalent as war\nagainst Germany and the chancellor\'s\nown communications to Austria-Hungary,\nare regarded as convincing\nproofs of the justice of Germany\'s\ncourse in the critical week preceding\nthe breach, but the newspapers gen\nerally express regard that these mat\nters were not published earlier\nWhat Dr. von BethmanHollweg\nhas said about German\'s willingness\nto enter a world union for compelling\npeace is endorsed generally, except\nby some conservative newspapers.\nThe Kreuz Zeltung. however, en\ndorses it. The Vorwaerts points out\nthat In favoring the settlement of\ndifferences by arbitration, the chan\ncellor takes up an old socialist plank\nand hopes also that the chancellor\'s\nspeech will tend to disperse the\nclouds of distrust In enemy countries.\nThe Vorwaerts adds: "In the chan\ncellor\'s speech we heard the rustle of\nthe wings of the future which will\nbring these horrors to an end."\nThe imperial chancellor\'s remark\nthat he never demanded the annexa\ntion of Belgium is generally treated\nas equivalent to a definite denuncia\ntion of annexation. \'The Kreuz Zel\ntung says it understands his words\nin this sense and regrets them along\nwith the other conservative organs\nlike Die Post, Tages Zeltung and the\nTaglishche Rundschau. These papers\nalso regret that the chancellor did\nnot define more clearly his position\nregarding Belgium and ask what the\nreal guarantees for Belgium\'s correct\nneutrality, as formerly demanded, he\nnow means to give.\nThe papers generally say that Vis\ncount Grey, the British foreign min\nister, has been answered effectively.\nThe Lokal Anzeiger says: "Splen\ndidly refuted."\nBEST MAN AT A WEDDING.\nTim Was Whin He Used to Assist In\nAbduoting the Bride.\nDo you know why the bridegroom\'s\nattendant at the wedding la called\n"best man" and bow be happens to be\nsuch an Important factor at society\nwedding? He Is supposed to look after\nthe ushers, the carriage, the wedding\nring and host of other things that\nthe fortunate lover could not be ex\npected to concern himself with at such\na time. But there was a period In the\nhistory of the human family when the .\nbest man bad other duties than these\nto perform. It was when there was no\nchurch ceremony and when primitive\npeople bad come to the conclusion that\nmarriage within the tribe was not good\nfor the race. Then It became the fash\nion for the young man of marriageable\nage to go forth In quest of a bride, the\ndaughter of some neighboring tribe.\nPerhaps the girls were not entirely\nunwilling to be captured, but no girl,\neither ancient or modern, would admit\nfor a moment that she bad wandered\naway from the protection of ber male\nrelatives for the actual purpose of be\ning abducted. Even If there was no\nbrother at band the girl was likely to\nput up a game fight, and the prospec\ntive bridegroom had need of the assist\nance of k strong muscled friend to aid\nhim In subduing ber. There was very\nlittle to the ceremony once the girl had\nbeen taken to the borne of her future\nlord, but tbe "best man" was always a\nhonored guest In her borne, especially\nIf the marriage turned out well. In\nmany mountainous parts of tbe civi\nlized world where old customs obtain\ntbe "best man" still pretends to assist\nIn abducting the bride.

Then, and not till then\nwas It dlaeovered that there was no\nbody on second base.\nIncredible as tt may seem, nineteen\nmen seventeen players and two um\npires had started tbe half Inning in\nthis fashion and not one of them got\nwise till Jones\' bit shot over the\nempty station.\nSchlafly reappeared at this Juncture,\nand the umpires decided, that the hit\nwas illegal when made with only eight\nmen In the field.
