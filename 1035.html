The\nAmerican flag was flying from the\nboat at time.\nAlthough the sailors were fishing\nthey were on official duty bringing ih\nfoor for their shin and the American\nflag flying from the boat denoted that\nit on official business.\nIt closely resembled the attacks on\nAmerican sailors which led to the oc\ncupation of Vera Cruz in 1914.

It could be done\nwith little effort. With a year\'s time\nin which to regulate all previous trans\nactions, fix up the dates on documents\nand get matters into proper shape, i\nseems to me the thing could be car\nried through in nice shape. Let\'s try\nit, anyhow.\nThe steamship Seminole, a 4500\nton boat, was launched from the\nOscar Daniels shipyard in Tampa Sat\nurday. This makes the fourth big\nsteamship launched in Tampa since\nthe ship building industry was reviv\ned. Marion county has local interest\nin the event, as the bottle of wine\nbroken over the ship\'s bow was\nthrown by Miss Annie Lester Patter\nson of Clearwater. Miss Patterson is\nthe daughter of Mrs. Markley, who is\nwell remembered to our people as\nMiss Jessie Barco.\nIt is reported that the guards over\nthe phosphate mines in Polk county\ncarry their rifles when they go around\nover the country. The law plainly\nsays that no man in Florida, except\na soldier on duty or an officer of the\nlaw, can carry a repeating rifle unless\nhe has a license. If the sheriff of\nPolk county allows these men to carry\nsuch guns without license, he is break\ning his oath of office and should be\nsuspended. "\nIf left to the vote of the people of\nFlorida the veto of the president of\nthe bill to repeal the so-called "day\nlight saving act", would have been\noverriden by a vote of probably fifty\nto one. Floridians are by no means\nslow, but this .daylight proposition is\ndecidedly too fast for them. Palatka\nTimes-Herald.\nIt seems ;to us like this law is pa\nternalism with a vengeance.\nIt is reported that Carter Glass\nsecretary of the treasury, will run for\nthe governorship of Virginia, hoping\nto use that office as a stepping stone\nto the United States Senate. The\nhabit of politicians of using an office\nmerely as an aid to gaining a higher\noffice is one of the curses of American\npublic affairs.\nSenator Colt of Rhode - Island, re\npublican, in a speech in the Senate,\ndeclared it to be his belief that "the\ngreat mass of the American people\nare convinced that something must be\ndone to prevent future wars," tha\n"they want something done," and tha\nthe league of nations may fill tha\nwant.\nCol. R. W. Davis,, mayor of Gaines\nville an dthe talented editor of the\nSun of that city, was in Ocala the\nother day. He has many friends here,\nwho are always glad to see him. We\nregret that he omitted the Star from\nhis calling: list. Ocala Star.\nWhich must not be taken as a dis\ncourtesy. When "Bob" Davis starts\ndown the street to make a call in any\nFlorida city he is held up every ten\nfeet of the way by some one who\nwants to shake his hand and talk over\nold times. He probably headed for\nthe Star office, all right, and found it\nwas train time before he had gotten\nhalfway. Palatka News.\nColonel Davis reached the Star of\nfice all right, but he went in the busi-\nness office where he found the busi\nness manager, who had just failed to\ncollect a bill of fourteen dollars and\nseventy-eight cents from a man who\nhad owed it three years. The b. m.\nstarted in to tell Col. Davis all the\nhings he wanted to do to that dead-\nbeat, and the colonel sympathized, and\nthen the b. m. told the col. some more,\nand the col. sympathized some more,\netc., etc., till the col. had to do a Mara\nthon to catch his train. No sooner\nhad he left when a man came in to\npay his subscription, and the b. m.\nentirely forgot the col. ind didn\'t tell\nthe intellectual end of the paper that\nthe col. had called. If we could just\nget the b. m\'s. mind off such paltry\nthings as dollars, we could make a\ngreat educational and literary journal\nout of the Star.\nThe Jacksonville Metropolis re\nmarks of the governor and his politi\ncal methods: After the last guber\nnatorial campaign. Governor Catts\ncalled at the Metropolis office to per\nsonally thank this paper for what he\ndeclared "was its unfailing fairness\ntowards him during the campaign,"\n(although he knew the Metropolis did\nnot support him). In the course of\nthe conversation the governor was\nasked why he had made such bitter at\ntacks on the Catholics, in his speeches\nthis being one of the chief planks\nin his platform. Catts then made this\nsignificant answer: "Governor Brow\nard was shrewd enough to have a\nbattle cry that he could shout loud\nand long all the time, and which, would\nstir the people up so they would talk\nabout it, and that battle cry. was \'the\nEverglades,\' and he worked it to a\nfinish and won. When I decided to en\nter the governor\'s race, I had to have\na battle cry which would stir up the\npeople, and after careful thought I\ndecided, to choose \'the Catholic ques\ntion.\' I worked it to a finish and i\nwon.\'.\' Now the governor is trying\nout this same idea again, in his race\nfor the U. S. Senate, and this time his\nbattle cry seems to be "class hatred,"\nfor he is preaching this to stir up\nlabor against capital. He probably\nbelieves this is the psychological time,\nwith all this uprest in the country.\nThe governor thinks, by using this\nmethod, he can get the laboring vote,\nbut he forgets that in the ranks of\nlabor areintelligent and loyal conser\nvative Americans who think for them\nselves, and the governor\'s apparent\nsolicitude for the laboring men is\nlaughably transparent. Intelligent la\nboring men are not being caught by\nthat kind of propaganda.\nUNCLASSIFIED\nADVERTISEMENTS\nWANTED, LOST, FOUND, FOR\nSALE, FOR RENT AND SIM\nILAR LOCAL NEEDS\nRATES Six line maximum, one\ntime, 25c.; three times, 50c; six times\n75c; one month $3.
