J. Johnson and Hattie\nJohnson, for conducting a bouse of ill\nfame, brought in a verdict of guilty,\nand Saturday morning Judge O’Neill\nsentenced each to a year and a half in\nWaupun, with two days solitary con\nfinement.\nOn the first ballot, the jury stood\nseven to five for conviction and on the\nnext three were equally divided. Two\njurors held out for over an hour and a\nhalf, hut finally joined the rest in a\nverdict of guilty. Before sentence\nwas imposed, D. T. Phalen, attorney\nfor the defendants moved anew trial,\nbut the motion was denied by Judge\nO’Neill.\nMuch credit is due District At\ntorney Theodore Brazeau for the zeal\nand persistence with which he has\nsought after and secured evidence to\nconvict the parties and for the suc\ncessful prosecution of the case. The\ncase is one few attorneys care to\nhandle and the breaking up of wbat\nhas for a long time been a nuisance to\nGrand Rapids, is evidence of a duty\nwell done.\nJACOB RADTKE DEAD\nFound in Road by Little Grand\nchild.\nWhile returning from a visit to a\nneighbor, Jacob Radtke, of the town\nof Sigel, dropped dead from heart\ndisease in the road not far from his\nhome.

He\nhid complained of not feeling well for\nsome time saying that his heart was\nbothering him.\nJacob Radtke was ninety years old,\nwas born in Poland, coming to this\ncountry after the death of his wife\nthirteen years ago. He has been living\nwith his son’s widow, and it was her\nlittle son, six years old, who found the\nold gentleman lying in the road, dead.\nHe was interred in the town of Sigel,\nSunday.\n“DONTS FOR HUSBANDS”\nDon’t forget that a woman likes\nlove tokens as well after as before\nmarriage.\nDon’t be unreasonably jealous.

Rather should you show an\nappreciation of her efforts to please\nyou.\nDon’t forget that your wife has a\nbirthday. A small present, accom\npanied by a kiss and a loving word, is\nquite as much appreciated as a costly\ngift.\nDon’t forget that your wife needs\nrecreation at times, just as much as\nyourself.\nDon't think that your wife can run\nthe house on five dollars per week,\nwhile you keep quite as much for\nyour own pocket.\nDon’t get out of temper if breakfast\nis a fraction of a miuate late. An\noverclouded morning denotes a stormy\nday.\nDon’t interfere in household\nmatters. That is your wife’s depart\nment, and you know little or nothing\nabout it.\nDon’t neglect to take an Interest in\nyour wife’s dress, and, above all, allow\nner sufficient money to dress according\nto your station.—Ex.\nADJUDGED INSANE\nJoseph Bredl, of Auburndale, was\nbrought to Grand Rapids last Friday\nafternoon, to be tried for bis sanity\nbefore County Judge Conway. Bredl\nhad been working in a mill (at Leona,\nWis., as a lumber grader and last\nWednesday morning came to bis home\nwithout having drawn bis pay. He\nwas noticed to act queerly, as though\nin a very happy mood, and was\nbrought here by Deputy Sheriff\nThomas of Marsh Held.\nHe created quite a scene in the\ncourtroom, by singing and clapping\nhis hands, as though greatly pleased\nover something. |He was adjudged\nInsane by Judge Conway and com\nmitted to the hospital at Oshkosh.\nBredl is a young man, and has a wife\nand live children in not very good\ncircumstances at Auburndale.\nNEW BILLIARD PARLOR\nWill be Opened In Grand Rapids\nNext Week.\nIn the building now occupied by the\nCity News Depot, there will be opened\nup during the next week, a billiard\nand pool parlor, to be owned and\noperated by A. L. Hobart, who comes\nfrom Green Bay.\nThe building will be entirely\nremodeled, and finished in solid oak\nfinish. Seven billiard and pool tables\nof the newest pattern will be installed.\nThe tables will be fitted with\n“Electric” cushions.\nMr. Hobart sajs his parlors will be\nconducted on a strictly businesslike\nmanner, and will be kept in a strictly\norderly manner. He wishes it to be\nunderstood from the beginning that\nunder no circumstances will minors\nbe allowed in the rooms, except on\nbusiness with someone within. A\nstock of tobaccos and cigars will be\nkept.\nTHE PRIMER OF\nFORESTRY COMPLETED\nPart Two, “Practical Forestry,*’\nhas Just Been Published.\nAsa source of positive information\nabout what forestry really is, and to\nspread a knowledge of its methods, a\nbook has been prepared by Mr. Gilford\nPinchot, Forester of the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture and Chief\nof the Bureau of Forestry, entitled\n“A Primer of Forestry,” which is\npublished in two parte. Part I was\nissued in 1899, and has passed through\nseveral editions, reaching a circulation\nof about 225,000 copies. It deals with\nthe life of a single tree, with trees as\nthey exist in a forest, with the life\nof a forest, and with the enemies of\nthe forest.\nPart II of the Primer has just been\npublished. It deals with “Practical\nForestry,” the purpose of which is\ndefined as “ to make the forest render\nits best service to man in such a way\nas to increase rather than to diminish\nits usefulness in the future.” In\nother words, it means “both the use\nand the preservation of the forest.”\nChapter lof Part II tells of the\nvaried uses of the forest; specifies the\nfour requisites if the forest is to yield\ngood returns under management\nprotection, strong and abundant\nreproduction, regular supply of ripe\ntrees, and growing space sufficient for\neach tree; discusses the yield of a\nforest, describing how it is determined\nand showing that it must keep even\npace with the growth; and concludes\nby describing the different systems of\ncutting trees in such a way as to get\nthe best returns from the forest,\nwhile at the same time improving its\nusefulness.\nThe second chapter discusses “Work\nin the Woods.” Conservative and\nordinary lumbering are contrasted,\nand the great superiority of conser\nvative work is shown. Information\nand suggestions are given on the\nwork from the time the tree is found\nstanding in the forest until it passes\nthrough some distant mill. The\nchapter is intensely practical, and\nindicates changes in present lumber\ning methods which will make for the\nadvantage of the forest.\nChapter 111 is entitled ‘‘The\nWeather and the Streams.” It dis\ncusses the influence forests have on\nclimate, and explains in detail the\neffect of forest cover on temperature,\nmoisture, evaporation, rainfall, and\nfallen rain. One of the most vitally\nimportant functions of the forest is\nto restrain the fallen rain, to prevent\nerosion of the soil, and to store away\nthe water for gradual use in the\nfuture.\nChapter IV, the last is a short\nsketch of the history of forestry\nabroad and at home. Important\nevents in forestry in this country are\nrecorded down to the first of this\nyear. The showing of the United\nStates is this field is behind that of\nevery civilized nation. Still initial\nsteps of high promise have recently\nbeen taken, and there can be no\nquestion but that the development of\na truly American system of forest\nmanagement, adjusted to our own\nconditions, is now fairly under way.\nPart II ofthe Primer supplements\nPart I, and the two together give the\nfundamentals or forestry in terse and\ncompact form. Part II is illustrated\nby 18 plates and 47 text figures. In\ntypographical execution and general\nappearance it is an exact counter\npart of Part I. The Primer as a whole\nwill be read with profit by every Jone\nwho takes a practical interest in the\nforests and who wishes to see them\nprotected and properly developed as\none of the gratest resources of the\nnation.\nHot Weather Piles.\n—Persons afflicted with piles should\nbe careful at this season of the year.\nHot weather and bad drinking water\ncontribute to the conditions which\nmake piles more painful and danger\nous, DeWitt’s Witch Hazel Salve\nstops the pain, draws out the soreness\nand cures.

COE’S RECOLLEC\nTION OF SPOONER\nWhen Spooner was a student at the\nstate university at Madison and still\nin his ’teens he went out each fall to\nmake a Republican speech in a strong\ndemocratic neighborhood a few miles\naway. It was a common experience\namong ambitious students, and not\nalways accompanied with results of a\ncharacter to inflate their self-esteem.\nThis occasion was one of that kind,\nfor as Spooner got well warmed up\nand was handing out hot propositions\non all sides, a trap door was opened in\nthe ceiling and a half a bushel of\nshelled corn poured over him. The\nmost of the audience were probably\nexpecting the performance and a\ntremendous hurrah and outcry fol\nlowed. But Spooner, who did not\nweigh much, if any, Lover a hundred\npounds, could get as mad as if he\npulled the beam down at a ton, and\nroaring out, “I can lick the fellow\nwho did that, I don’t care how big he\nis,” he dashed out of the school house\nand around to the back end where he\nsaw the entrance of the attic to be.\nBut on getting there he saw the\nladder disappearing into the upper\ndoor and the jeering mug of the corn\nthrower looking out mockingly at\nhim. Daring him to come down and\nmeet him like a man till he became\nconvinced that there was no fight in\nthe fellow, he went back and finished\nhis speech. His grit and perseverance\nwon the favor of the crowd and they\ngave him good attention and generous\napplause thereafter.—Whitewater Re\ngister.\nWILL SURVEY WATER\nPOWER ON WISCONSIN RIVER\nA bill introduced in the assembly\nMonday evening by the committee on\nlumbering and mining to provide for\na thorough survey of the water powers\nof Wisconsin, in accordance with the\nrecommendation of the governor’s\nmessage upon the subject of water\npowers and dam privileges. The bill\nprovides for a survey of the water\npowers of the state by the geological\nand natural history survey, to\nascertain the size of the available\nwater powers in connection with the\nwork of the United States geological\nsurvey. It appropriates the sum of\n$2,500 for the purpose. The informa\ntion obtained will be of the greatest\nassistance in securing the utilization\nof the powers for commercial and\nother uses.\nTHE FOURTH CONCERT\nOf the Green Bay Choral Society\nTuesday, May 23.\n—The fourth concert of the Green\nBay Choral society will be given at\nthe Green Bay Theater May 23. The\nprincipal attraction will be sixteen\nyear old Mary Law violinist whose\nhome is in London. The two local\norganizations, the Ladies Treble Clef\nclub and the double male quartette,\nboth consisting of trained voices will\nalso appear on the program. The\nchorus will be composed of 100 voices.\nMary Law of London who is now\nstudying in Chicago, is a pupil of the\nfamous Sauret of Paris, who promises\nthat within a few years she will be\nthe wonder of the age. The op\nportunity of hearing so celebrated a\ncharacter should not be missed.\nThe ladies’ and gentlemen’s organ\nizations are composed of trained\nvoices, the best in the city, and have\nwon enviable reputations for them\nselves.\nThe chorus consists of over 100\nvoices the members having sung to\ngether for several seasons under the\ndirection of Professor William Boep\np*er of Chicago.\nGreen Bay will be the Mecca of all\nmusic lovers within a radius of many\nmiles on the night of May 23.\nLEMONWEIR\nDISTRICT CONVENTION\nTheColoma correspondent to the\nHancock News had the following\naccount of the Lemonweir Convention\nheld there last week:\nThe Lemonweir Convention of\nCongregational churches held here\nlast week was well attended, the\nchurches in the district being well\nrepresented. The subject of education\nin our smaller colleges and academies\nwas thoroughly presented bv Prof,\nEricson, of Ripon, and Rev. Ellis of\nEndeavor. The subject of missions,\nboth home and foreign, discussed by\nMrs. A. L. Fontaine and Mrs. Geo, R.\nGardner, both of Grand Rapids, was\na very interesting feature of the\nprogram. The Convention was full of\ninterest and profit to those desirous\nof living better lives.\n—Wanted— lnformation as to the\naddress of the heirs of Jacob C.\nIngraham.

Ad\ndress, Harvey Spalding & Sons,\nWashington, D, C. 12-3 t\nTHE WEEK IN\nTHE LEGISLATURE\nSlow Progress Made Over (he\nBig Measures—Adjournment\nSeems Hazy-Important Bills\nto Come Up For Settlement\nNext Week-Some of Those\nPassed.\nWith the middle of May at hand\nthe cannot yet see light\nahead for final adjournment. So far\nas the assembly is concerned it could\nwind up its business in a week or two\nmore with hard work, provided too\nmany bills did not come back from\nthe upper house. It is in the senate\nwhere there is sticking. Nearly all\nmeasures of large importance, such\nas the railroad rate bill, the civil ser\nvice measure, the Thayer bill, the\nStout liquor bill, the forestry meas\nures and others, yet await final ac\ntion at the hands of the senators and\nsince all will be subjected to more or\nless debate it is plain to be seen that\nthe session cannot end much if any\nbefore June 1. Indeed Senator Hage\nmeister, who has had long experience\nin legislation, sees no hope of winding\nup the business of the session before\nthe middle of June.\nSeveral of the big measures will be\nup next week, as for instance, the\nrate .bill which has been favorably\nreported by the committee on claims.\nThe fact that there are two bills\ncomplicates the situation somewhat.\nThe committee bill asks lor an ap\npointive commission while the minor\nity report is for an elective one.\nThis and the further point that one\nprovides for a stay if an appeal is\ntaken from a ruling, while the other\nwants an injunction issued before a\nstay is granted constitute the main\npoints of difference.\nThe Thayer bill comes up early in\nthe week now in the form of a refer\nendum on the local license proposi\ntion instead of the remonstrance\nfeature in the original bill. Even\nin this form the bill will be hard\nfought.\nThe appropriation bills are now\ncoming along nicely. The bill giving\n$275,000 for normal schools at Platte\nville and Milwaukee having been\nsigned by the governor the other in\nstitutions that were dependent on the\nfate of these will now get relief.\nOne of the important bills that\nwent through the assembly this week\nis one providing for the abolition of\ndower and courtesy and the substitu\ntion in their stead of statutory divi\nsions of property after the death of\neither husband of wife. Under its\nterms one half of the estate of the\nhusband, both real and personal re\nverts to the widow, and one third of\nthe estate of the wife under like cir\ncumstances.\nOne of the surprises of the week\nwas the passage by the senate over\nthe governor’s veto of the bill giving\ncertain parole powers to the board of\ncontrol. The veto may be sustained\nby the assembly but the vote will be\nclose even there as many members\nthink it a good bill.\nThe bill compelling telephone com\npanies to make physical connection\nwas first turned down by the assem\nbly, then reconsidered and passed by\na good vote. The assembly also\npassed the bill prohibiting discrim\nination in telephone charges in cities\nof the same class.\nThere is another telephone war on,\ninvolving the question whether the\ncompanies shall be taxed on the ad\nvalorem system, instead of by license,\nas at present, and strange as it may\nseem, the Bell company favors It,\nwhile the opposition comes from the\ninaependants.\nThe bill to compel counties to em\nploy a supervisor of assessments has\npassed the house, but will have a\nhard time iu the senate, where the\ntight will be renewed. On general\nprincipals the assessors of the state\nobject to being supervised.—Madison\nState Journal.\nSTATE GAME LAWS\nWILL BE REVISED\nMadison, Wis., May 13.—Senator\nWlpperman, chairman of the joint\ncommittee on fish and game of the\nlegislature, will visit Milwaukee today\nand upon his return to Madison will\nput in all his available time preparing\nfor his report upon all the fish and\ngame bills introduced. The last\npublic hearing by the committee will\nbe had Tuesday and immediately\nthereafter it is the intention of the\ncommittee to present to the legis\nlature its draft of a general revision\nof the game laws of the state.\nThe provisions in the twenty-four\nbills have in many cases been incor\nporated in the general bill which the\ncommittee is preparing.

There is only one\nway to cure deafness, and that is by constitu\ntional remedies. Deafness is caused by an\ninflamed condition of the mucous lining of the\nEustachian Tube. When this tube is inflamed\nyou have a rumbling sound or imperfect hear\ning, and when it is entirely closed, Deafness is\nthe result, and unless the inflammation can be\ntaken out and this tube restored to its normal\ncondition, hearing will be destroyed forever;\nnine cases out of ten are caused by catarrh,\nwhich is nothing but an inflamed condition of\nthe mucous surfaces.\nWe will give One Hundred Dollars for any case\nof Deafness (caused by catarrh) that cannot be\ncured by Hall’s Catarrh Cure.

At least some\ntime before the murder last fall,\nKaratsky appeared to be in sound\nmind. His appearance at times, now,\nImpresses one as|that of one bereft\nof all sense, and before whom there\nstands at all times, a spectre of the\nvictim of bis madness, and fresh signs\nof his henious crime.\nWhen first seen by a visitor to his\ncell, Karatsky is almost invariably\npacing about the iron cage in which\nhe is contined. He almost continually\nholds his hands to his head, with a\nfinger in each ear, as though to shut\nout the sound. The sound of any\nthing falling seems to strike him like\na blow, and lor some time after the\nsound he cries and sobs to himself. At\ntimes he stands still, and stares at bis\nhands, and pours water on them, and\nappears to be trying to wash some\nthing from them. When his cell was\nbeing washed, he laughed with great\nglee, and stood pointing at imaginary\nobjects being taken from the room.\nHour after hour is spent in this\nmanner, till the physical body is worn\nout and he is compelled to rest.\nPale, thin, and with a worn out air,\npacing about the narrow confines of\nhis prison, apparently at all times\nhaunted by the memory of his crime,\nhe presents a piteous spectacle. Men\nwill endure Klondike: they will engage\nin the fiercest battles; even suffer for\nmonths in infernal Africa, but will\ncome forth sound, at least In mind.\nWhat, then, can be the terrible\nthoughts capable of such results, of\nhim on whose bands are the stains of\nthe awful crime of murder. The only\ntrace of what was once a strong mind\nis the shrewdness which is shown.\nAt times, Karatsky appears rational.\nThe question of his sanity is to be\ndecided in court, in answer to a plea\nmade by his attorney, D. D. Conway.\nIf all his insanity is assumed, he is a\ngood actor; his appearance nowi\npitiful, and at the same time horrible,\nia full of the signs of great mental\ndeterioration, the unmistakeable\nstains of crime.\n—Within the past week alone, no less\nthan five cyclones have visited the\nUnited States, causing a loss of ?\nmillion dollars and a thousand lives.\nThe storm path extends toward\nWisconsin, and now is the time to look\nup cyclone insurance.

Breathed\nthrough the neat pocket inhaler that\ncomes with every outfit, its healing,\nvolatile, antiseptic fragrance reaches\nthe lungs and air passages, as no\nstomach dosing possibly can do. It\ngives immediate relief and makes\nlasting cures.\nProof that the Hyomei treatment\nwill do all that is claimed for it is\nfound in the guarantee under\nwhich John E.
