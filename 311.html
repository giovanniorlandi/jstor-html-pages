Introduction\nDesmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an\nextremely uncommon, highly aggressive, andmalignantmesenchymal\nneoplasm of undetermined histogenesis [1]. Less\nthan 200 case reports have been documented in literature\nso far [2]. DSRCT has a distinctive tendency to affect young\nmales in their 2nd and 3rd decades of life with a male-tofemale\nratio of 4 : 1 [3]. Peritoneal cavity is the most frequent\nsite of involvement and often associated with diffuse multiple\nperitoneal implants [4].\nDiagnosis of DSRCT is exceptionally challenging. Clinical\nsigns and symptoms, as well as radiological findings, are\nnonspecific and similar to other intra-abdominal primary\nneoplasms [5].Microscopically,DSRCT ismade upof distinct\ncollections of small round blue tumor cells surrounded by\nplentiful desmoplastic fibrous stroma [5]. Collective expression\nof mesenchymal, epithelial and neural markers [3, 4]\nand its association with a distinctive chromosomal reciprocal\ntranslocation (t(11; 22)(p13; q12)) [6] yield definitive diagnosis\nof DSRCT.\nDSRCT has an extremely poor prognosis with an overall\n5-year survival rate of nearly 15% [7]. Nemours combined\naggressive treatment regimens were attempted; however, neither\ncurative outcome nor notable impact on long-term sur-\nvival was achieved [2, 8]. Further optimal management protocols\nhave yet to be explored.\n', '2 Case Reports in Gastrointestinal Medicine\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1: Coronal (a) and transverse (b) chest, abdominal, and pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans: showing a 3.8 ×\n7.2 × 8.7 cm ill-definedmass, involving gastric fundus and extending into gastric cardia and lower gastroesophageal junction. It was associated\nwith multiple enlarged gastrohepatic lymph nodes. There was no evidence of ascites or retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphatic metastases.\nHerein, we report a 26-year-old otherwise healthy female\npatient who presented with a 1-month history of epigastric\npain.\n2. Case Report\nA 26-year-old otherwise healthy female patient presented\nto King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center with\na 1-month history of epigastric pain. Systemic review was\nremarkable for night sweating and weight loss of 7 kg. On\nphysical examination, a palpable, slightly mobile, and tender\nepigastric mass was detected. All laboratory tests including\ncomplete blood count, renal, bone, hepatic, and coagulation\nprofiles, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), carcinoembryonic\nantigen (CEA), alfa-feto protein (AFP), CA 19-9, and CA 12-5\nwere normal.\nBarium meal study showed an ill-defined mass involving\ngastric fundus and extending into gastric cardia and lower\ngastroesophageal junction. A chest, abdominal, and pelvic\ncontrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans\nshowed a 3.8 × 7.2 × 8.7 cm ill-defined mass, involving\ngastric fundus and extending into gastric cardia and lower\ngastroesophageal junction (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). It was\nassociatedwithmultiple enlarged gastrohepatic lymphnodes;\nthe largest measured 1.2 cm.There was no evidence of ascites\nor retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphatic metastases.\nA CT-guided tissue biopsy was obtained and revealed\nDSRCT. Positron emission tomography (PET) (Figure 2(a))\nand transverse-section PET-CT (Figure 2(b)) scans showed\nhypermetabolic fluorodeoxyglucose- (FDG-) avid mass\nlesion in gastric fundus, extending into gastric cardia and\nlower gastroesophageal junction. In addition, it was associated\nwith a few hypermetabolic FDG-avid lesions in the\ngastrohepatic junction, indicating lymph node metastases.\nNo evidence of distant metastasis was identified. In view of\na probable neoplastic lesion, the Surgical Oncology team\nadvised for surgical resection.\nPatient underwent total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy,\nsplenectomy, and antecolic Roux-en-Y\nesophagojejunal anastomosis. All resectionmargins were free\nfrom tumor cells. Metastatic tumor was found in five out of\neighteen gastrohepatic lymph nodes. The common hepatic\nartery lymph nodes and the porta-hepatis lymph nodes were\nall reactive and negative for malignancy. The lymph nodes\naround the celiac access, splenic artery, and splenic hilum\nwere involved and enlarged. Spleen showed no significant\npathology. No evidence of ascites or peritoneal carcinomatosis\nwas detected.\nMacroscopically, the outer surface of the resected gastric\nmass was white, irregular, firm, and marked with several\nprominences. Cut section of gastricmass revealed a 2.5× 4.5×\n6.5 cm, irregular, ulcerated, necrotic, and hemorrhagic mass\ninvolving the gastric fundus, and extending into cardia and\nlower gastroesophageal junction (Figure 3(a)).\nMicroscopically, histopathological examination of the\nresected gastric mass revealed intact epithelial mucosa and\npresence of sheets of small round blue cells separated by\nminimal desmoplastic stroma (Figure 3(b)). Immunohistochemical\nstains showed diffuse perinuclear staining pattern\nwith desmin, but characteristic dot positivity was not prominent\n(Figure 3(c)).Therewas focalmild positive stainingwith\nAE1/AE3 (cytokeratin) (Figure 3(d)) as well as patchy dot\npositivitywithWT1 (Figure 3(e)).Therewas negative staining\nwith smoothmuscle actin, calretinin,Myo-D1,myogenin,CD\n45, chromogranin A, EMA, TTF1, synaptophysin, and S100.\nStrong positivity with desmin, AE1/AE3, and WT1 suggested\nthat this lesion is most likely to be a case of DSRCT of stomach.\nFurthermore, the resected specimen was analyzed by\nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique and\nconfirmed the diagnosis of DSRCT of stomach by identifying\nthe characteristic EWS-WT1 gene fusion protein. Moreover,\nbecause of the unusual presentation, the resected specimen\nwas sent to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, USA, for diagnostic\nworkup and results confirmed the abovementioned\ndiagnosis (i.e., DSRCT of stomach).\nPatient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day in\na good condition and received no adjuvant radiotherapy or\nchemotherapy. A postoperative 3-month followup failed to\nshow any recurrence.\n', 'Case Reports in Gastrointestinal Medicine 3\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2: Positron emission tomography (PET) (a) and transverse-section positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)\n(b) scans: showing hypermetabolic fluorodeoxyglucose- (FDG-) avid mass lesion in gastric fundus and extending into gastric cardia and\nlower gastroesophageal junction.

Discussion\nDesmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an\nextremely uncommon, highly aggressive, andmalignantmesenchymal\nneoplasm of undetermined histogenesis [1]. It was\nfirst described byGerald andRosai in 1989 as a newly featured\nclinicopathologic entity [1]. It occurs most frequently in\nadolescent (young) males in their 2nd to 3rd decades of life,\nwith a male-to-female ratio of approximately 4 : 1 [3]. Peritoneal\ncavity is the most frequent site of involvement and\noften associated with diffusemultiple peritoneal implants [4].\nExtraperitoneal structures are occasionally involved and\ninclude lung [9], pleural serosa [10], parotid gland [11], ovary\n[12], paratesticular region [13], posterior cranial fossa [14],\npancreas [15], soft tissue, and bone [16]. DSRCT has a\nparticular increased propensity to diffusely spread along\nmesothelial-lined surfaces such as peritoneum and omentum\n(mesentery) [4, 5] with extensive lymphogenous and hematological\nmetastases [2, 17]. Liver and lungs are the two most\ncommon regions involved in distant hematogenous metastases\n[2, 17].\nDiagnosis of DSRCT is exceptionally challenging. Clinical\nsigns and symptoms, as well as radiological findings,\nare nonspecific and similar to other intra-abdominal primary\nneoplasms [5, 8]. Such clinical signs and symptoms\ninclude nausea, vomiting, weight loss, abdominal pain, palpable\nabdominal mass, and ascites. Such radiological find-\nings include calcifications, hydronephrosis, urinary obstruction,\nbowel obstruction, nodular peritoneal thickening, and\nretroperitoneal lymphadenopathy [5]. Despite the nonspecific\nradiological findings, chest computed tomography (CT)\nand whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scans\nare regularly done for staging purposes [18].\nMacroscopically, DSRCT appears as a large mass (sometimes\nreaching up to 20–40 cm in diameter) and is frequently\naccompanied by numerous peritoneal deposits. The outer\nsurface is often smooth, firm, and bosselated (marked with\nbosses/eminences/protuberances). Cut section of DSRCT\nexhibits grey-tanned or whitish-grey surfaces associated with\nvariable necrotic and hemorrhagic areas and occasionally\nmyxoid changes [3–5, 19].\nMicroscopically, DSRCT is made up of distinct collections\nof small round blue tumor cells separated by plentiful\ndesmoplastic fibrous stroma.The stromamay containmyxoid\nchanges, cystic degenerations, or calcifications. Stroma can\nbemostly cellular or stromal although equal cellular and stromal\nproportions are also possible. Stroma typically contains\nspindle-shaped cells looking like fibroblasts or myofibroblasts.\nRosette-like or palisading structures can be visualized.\nFurthermore, DSRCT is composed of small- to mediumsized\ntumor cells with ill-defined cell boarders, oval- to\nround-shaped hyperchromatic nuclei, indistinct nucleoli, and\nincreased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios. Variable degrees of\nmitotic and apoptotic figures are often seen. Eosinophilic\ncytoplasmic inclusion bodies can occasionally be identified\n[3–5, 19]. Cytological analysis is feasible from tissue biopsy\nand fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens [20]. Ascitic\nand pleural fluid specimens are also of benefit especially if\ntissue biopsy or FNA specimens are difficult to obtain [20].\nThe rarity of DSRCT as well as its histopathological and\ncytological similarities to other small round blue cell tumors\nmakes the diagnosis quite challenging.\nImmunohistochemical techniques can be used to confirm\naccurate diagnosis of DSRCT. Immunohistochemically,\nDSRCT cells demonstrate positive staining to a wide variety\nof epithelial (cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen),\nmesenchymal (vimentin and desmin), and neural (CD56\nand neuron-specific enolase) markers [3, 4]. This multiple\nantigen expression profile is largely characteristic for DSRCT\nand can be utilized to distinguish DSRCT from the other\nhistologically related small round blue cell tumors [8].\n', '4 Case Reports in Gastrointestinal Medicine\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n(e)\nFigure 3: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) of the resected gastric tumor mass. (a) Gross examination: cut section of gastric\nmass revealed a 2.5 × 4.5 × 6.5 cm, irregular, ulcerated, necrotic, and hemorrhagic mass involving the gastric fundus and extending into cardia\nand lower gastroesophageal junction. (b) Histopathological examination: showing intact epithelial mucosa and presence of sheets of small\nround blue cells separated by minimal desmoplastic fibrous stroma. (c) Desmin immunostaining: showing positive cytoplasmic staining in\nthe tumor cells (magnification power: ×400). (d) AE1/AE3 (cytokeratin) immunostaining: showing focal mild positive staining in the tumor\ncells (magnification power: ×400). (e) WT1 immunostaining: showing dot-like positivity in the tumor cells (magnification power: ×400).\nDSRCT is associated with a distinctive chromosomal\nreciprocal translocation (t(11; 22)(p13; q12)), which fuses the\nEwing’s sarcoma gene on chromosome 22 to the Wilm’s\ntumor type 1 gene on chromosome 11 [6]. This translocation\nresults in EWS-WT1 gene fusion protein which is an altered\ntranscriptional factor that modifies gene expression and\neventually promotes uncontrolled proliferation of DSRCT\ncells. This translocation can be identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase\nchain reaction (RT-PCR) method [21],\nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique [22], or\npositive immunohistochemical staining toWilm’s tumor type\n1 (WT1) protein [23]. The EWS-WT1 gene fusion protein\nserves as a disease-specific marker and yields a definitive\ndiagnosis of DSRCT [6].\nCurrently, there are no standard (consensus) management\nprotocols for DSRCT [2, 5]. This is attributed to its\nextreme rare incidence, high aggressive behavior, and lack\nof validated staging system for DSRCT [2]. In addition,\n', 'Case Reports in Gastrointestinal Medicine 5\nall contemporary treatments have been only studied on\na small series of patients or described in a limited number\nof case reports [5]. Aggressive surgical resection (debulking),\nradiotherapy, multiple-agent chemotherapy, and myeloablative\nchemotherapy with stem-cell rescue in selected cir-\ncumstances have been shown to yield the best outcomes\n[7, 24, 25]. Newer novel treatment modalities which require\nfurther evaluations include cytoreductive surgery followed by\ncontinuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) with\ncisplatin [26], and Yttrium [90Y] microsphere treatment for\nliver metastasis in DSRCT [27]. Still, all contemporary treatment\nmodalities for DSRCT are not curative and do not war-\nrant long-term survival benefits [28].\nIn our case, the patient underwent only complete surgical\nresection (debulking) with no other modality, and, after\na three-month followup, she presented with no recurrences.\nNo decision was taken to use either chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nIn the opinion of our Medical Oncology team,\nchemotherapy remains controversial as the side effects of the\ntreatment may overweigh the minimal gain in survival. In\naddition, the tumor is radioresistant and certainly the use of\nradiotherapy may cause toxicity and cause harm more than\nbenefit.\nDSRCT is an extremely uncommon, highly aggressive,\nandmalignant mesenchymal neoplasm of undetermined histogenesis\n[1, 4]. Prognosis of DSRCT is extremely poor with\nan overall 5-year survival rate of 15% (median survival\nranges from 17 to 25 months) [7]. This is because DSRCT is\nonly slightly sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and\ncomplete surgical excision is hardly ever achieved [29].\nNemours combined aggressive treatment regimens were\nattempted; however, neither curative outcome nor notable\nimpact on long-term survival was achieved [28]. Further\noptimal management protocols have yet to be explored.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors sincerely acknowledge the editorial assistance of\nMs. Ranim Chamseddin, College of Medicine, Alfaisal University,\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nReferences\n[1] W.
