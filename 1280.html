        <pre>['The Grangeville Globe\nOFFICIAL PAPER OF IDAHO COUNTY\nVOL- I 1 - NO - 30\nGRANGEVILLE, IDAHO\nCOUNTY, IDAHO, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 23, 1909\nSI.00 THE YEAR\nDISMISSAL of\nprof, french\nI\nh* of F " U *» \'he\nC", f ">™ *•\nI\nStandpoint.\n,\nIn regard to the matter of the dis\nmissal of Prof. H. T. French from\nthe state agricultural college, about\nwhich so much has been said, and in ■ *\nwhich most of the citizens through- !\nout the state are more or less inter- ;\nested, there are some points which ;\nhave been brought out prominently by\nMr. French\'s own statements that are ;\nworthy of consideration in connection\nwith his management of the agri\ncultural department. Mr. French is !\nquoted as having said in his recent |\nvisit to Boise, that\n"The state of Idaho has no agri\ncultural college. There is lots of |\nfroth, but there is no college, and one\nshould be built and the money utilized\nfor the purposes to which it was in- i\ntended. I could not recommend that\nmy own son attend the agricultural\ndepartment, for the simple reason that\nthere is no college, no equipment, no\npreparation made for instruction and\nno room for such instruction. Dur-!\ning the last year five agricultural i\nteachers had to use one room in\nwhich to give instruction and the j\nfunds intended for agricultural work!\'\nhave been expended for nearly every i\nother conceivable purpose connected\nwith the institution except for agri\ncultural work. Out of $30,000 re\nceived from the government last year\nfor the agricultural college only\n$673.75 went for instruction in agri\nculture, notwithstanding there were\n... * , . . * . . ,,\nthirty students receding instruction.\nuc s ements seem most re ~\nmar a e, coming as t ey do from\nhe man who for the past eleven years\nhat been at the head of the agricultural\ncollege and who without hesitancy has\nccepted a good salary for the con\nuc ing o sue co ege, and who now\natthe expiration of h.s tenure of office,\nhrows as a bomb into the public press\nthe announcement that the whole\nthing is a myth, and he has been re\nceiving pay for something he\ndid, and knew all the time he\ndoing.\ndI - r o o , _\n... ** en \'\' ^ Sweet, of Grange\n\' e \' sa ^ s " re at £ S e university\nsome two years ago worked destruc\nton that required time to restore and !\n.L. ^ emenCe na i cr? !,nA reSU - e ^î\ne present $511,000 agricultural :\ncollege was constructed as promptly :\n« possible and that Mr. French him-!\nJ*™ N« Panning and supervision\nonme building. If it is in any way\ntetective or inconvenient he certainly\nis responsible for it. Mr. F rench also\nrequested that in the replacing of the\nequipment destroyed by fire that the\nexDendin.re k. i:„k. .u V \'\nSEfS". be llght that a neater P«r- :\nuorwQt the insurance money might be\nPut into the building, which was his\nSocial hobby, and his suggestions\ncomplied with. This now furnishes\nme grounds for one of his principle\ncomplaints, which is that of the\njo,000 insurance he deceived only\n**>100 for equipment, which was in\n*cwrd with his own request.\nThe college records show over\nro >- F rench\'s sworn statement to the !\njjovernment, that instead of $673.75\n\'ng the limit of expenditures for the\nCaching of ariculture, $873.75 was\nUpended from the Morrill fund and\n>000 from the state fund, making a\ntotal of $1873.75.\naj^ r - .Sweet further says, that during\n"to entire reign of Mr. French not a\ncall ^ an \' ma I s tl* at might be\n. e< | representative of any breed was\nraised\nthere\nnever\nwas not\nj\nj\n:\nwere\non the college farm, nor was f\na pure bred chicken, one of the\ne* atest sources of revenue on a farm,\non the place.

But that there\nother good and sufficient\nthe belief that Mr. French was heartily\n* 1 sympathy with such action,\nIt has always been the policy of the\nboard where dissatisfaction with any\nof the instructors from any cause has\narisen, to keep their own counsel in\nth e matter and to accept a voluntary\nresignation from the person without\npublicity or friction. Such a course\nwas open to Mr. French, hut here\nfused to accept it, preferring to carry\nthe matter into public print and thereby\nattempt to coerce the board into re\ntaining him whether satisfactory to I\nthem or not. T his action on the\nP art of Mr. French has finally forced\nthe board for the time being to for\nsa k e the nonpublicity policy, in de\ntense of the truth and the best interests\n°f the university. This is greatly re\nRretted by the board, hut no other\ncourse was open to it.\nThe Moscow Star-Mirror of last\ni week gives full details from the rec\nor <I s °f many of the points of differ\nj f nce under discussion, and it is stating\n1 m ildly to say that its version\ni sheds hut little glory upon Mr. French\nas an experimenter in agriculture and\nstock raising. We would be pleased\nto K\' ve the report in detail, but space\nforbids. __\nSCHNELL EAKIN.\nT l,p home Mr »nrl u rc I J\n, \' \\ s \'\nOverman was the scene of a very\npretty wedding , ast Friday evening, in\nwhich the contracting parties were\nfYIiss Bessie Fàakin and F.dward\nSchne „ of E | k City.

It is not only what the\npeople there are doing, and say they\nare going to do, that impresses the\nvisitor, but there is an air of confi\ndence and a show of prosperity that\ncarries absolute conviction that Elk\nCity will never again lose its grip on\ncapital and progressive ness.\nThe air is full of the big strike near\nthe Epsy, or South Fork mines, on\nwhat is known as the Center Star,\nwhere several feet of free milling ore,\nas aying something like $200 per ton,\nwas struck a few days ago; of the three\ngold dredges that are being installed;\nof the wonderful showing in the Bus\nter, where a fine body of ore of suffi\ncient magnitude to furnish three year\'s\nwork is now blocked out and in sight.\nThese, with minor mining events\nfurnish interesting topics of conver\nsation, while the fact that the three\nhotels are doing a rushing business\nand the two larger ones are building\nadditions doubling their capacity,\nclinches the fact there is something\ngoing on there.\nThe Challenge Accepted.\n\'The Bargain Store force has sig\nnified its willingness to meet in the\nring in a contest of anywhere from\nfive to forty rounds, Marquis of Goose\nberry rules, or catch-as-catch-can, any\nold bunch of equal number that the\nAlexander-Freidenrich company can\nmuster, and guarantees to put them\nout, both shoulders down, within the\ntimelimit, or publicly confess - their\nerror in judgment.

It takes longer to\nsecure seats than teachers and it would\nbe wise to order additional desks soon.\nA few words as to the work done «\nin the high school. The salary paid g\nfor teachers there was about $2,8UU,\ninstead of §4,000 as some have cal- (\nculated. The total enrollment was\nsixty-four and the average attendance\nwas forty-nine plus— a little better than\nin the grades figured in per cents. Of\nthe 64 enrolled, 16 did not attend 90\ndays or one-half the year and six\nothers did not attend enough to war\nrant them in expecting to earn or\nreceive full credits.\ndid attend regularly 38 did good,\nhonest faithful work, 22 of them re\nceiving 8 or more credits each and 16\nothers, 5, 6 and 7 each. One should\nremember that some students deserve\nmuch praise for securing 6 or 71\npoints as others who receive 8 or 10\ncredits—there is a difference in sub\njects and also in pupils. A few made\nthe mistake of attempting say ten\ncredits and succeeded in securing but\nfive or six or seven, although the extra\nwork done will count or help in next\nBeside five boys with\nOf the 42 who\nyears record,\nsporting propensities who attended but\nimperfectly, we had four students\nwho did unsatisfactory work.\nThe high school as a body earned\nand received 320 points that will be\naccepted in at the university or nor\nm.l .h\ni f ~ tbat \' s an avera ce of 8 credits\n^ our president\n?\' U \\ wfl ° these can tell\nthat . there were a lot of them and\nrna ,\' n Wltb high standings.

The perplexing thing is to be\nable at all times to figure out just when\na man makes a mistake in fact or does\nit intentionally, so that justice may be\ndone him. However, as it is a point\nin law, as well as good morals, to\ngive the one arraigned the benefit of\nthe doubt, it might be well in a gentle\nway to correct the statement made by\nthe Lewiston Teller in the latter part\nof the following article, both for the\nbenefit of the editor as well as others,\nby citing the law in the case. The\nTeller savs:\nThe local option question is grow\ning warm in the southern counties of\nIdaho. In Bingham, Bannock and\nFremont petitions circulated have re\nceived the required number of signa\ntures, and will be presented to the\ncounty commissioners at the July\na meeting of the board. Reports from\nthere say, though, that it is not at\nall certain what action will he taken,\nowing to the uncertainty of that section\nof the law which provides for the ex\npense of the special election. It seems\nprobable that the expense might fall\non those signing the petition, and is\nnot provided for from the general fund\nof the county.\nHow anyone conversant with the\nEnglish language who is seeking after\nthe truth in the case could afrive at\nthe conclusion that the Teller doej\nafter reading the following section\nfound on page 10, Idaho Session Laws,\nis puzzling, indeed :\nSection 10. In all elections here\nunder the qualifications of voters shall\nbe the same as in general elections,\nand in all matters and proceedings npt\nherein otherwise specified, all the pro\nvisions, including those relating to\npenalties, of the general election laws\n• of the state shall apply and be ob\nserved, as far as the same are appli\ncable, and all expenses of such elec\ntion shall be paid in the same\nand out of the same fund as in the\ncase of general elections held in the\ncounty.\nThe editors of the south part of the\nstate are trying to get free transporta\ntion for themselves and families to the\nAlaska-Yukon exposition, that they\nmay hit the "paystreak" to the\nof the few denarius which they have\nbeen able to accumulate along during\nthe past months of labor, without pay\ning toll to the railroads for the priv\nilege. If the south end brethern hit\nit off right with the transportation\nmagnates in such a way as to clear\ntheir skirts with the anti-pass law,\nthey might throw the end of the string\nthis way after pulling it. There may\nbe other proud spirits within the\nwho would stoop to ride free to the\nseaboard to see the elephant drink salt\nwater.\nfor\ncal\nare\nthe\nhis\nof\nall\nmanner\nis\ntune\nstate\nThe Moscow Star-Mirror has tak\nen a hand in the Prof. H. T. French\nUniversity controversy and has publish\nÎ \' the record of that institution dur\nl the eleven years the professor was\nnnected with it. This makes a\nvery poor showing for Mr. French,\nin fact it shows rank incompetency on\nh^s part, the very grounds upon which\nit is claimed he was discharged. Of\n194 Angora goats which Mr French\npurchased for the purpose of demon\nÎ iting their superiority over the j\nthe and grubbing hoe as brush eat\n, only 47 remained when an in- !\nvestigation was called through reports\nm|ade to the legislature of the outrage\nous conditions existing on the farm.\nIjhe others had been allowed to starve !\nto death through sheer neglect. The\ncommittee which investigated the\ngc|at farm in connection with Mr.\nFtench himself was composed of Pres.\nL^wis, of Moscow, and Regent E.\nS. Sweet, of Orangeville. A résolu\ntion was passed recommending "thatjDR\nthe goat experiment be closed out and |\nthàt Prof. French be asked to see that [\nth^: financial loss to the University, !\nresulting from the failure of the ex- |\npériment, be made good."\nFrench never did make good the loss,\nalthough iiis neglect of supervision\nwas directly responsible for the loss\nof the goats as well as their inhuman\nMr.\ntreatment.\nI\nT is strange as well as amusing at\ntinies, how honest men will differ on j\nsubjects which they consider of vital j\nimportance to the general weal, in re\nligions, political, moral and matters of\nexpediency in public as well as private j\naffsiirs; and it is well that this is true.\nExchange of ideas and opinions has a\ntendency to broaden and enlarge the j\nmental powers and teaches tolerance\nfor opposing views as well as a practi\ncal charity for those who stand for\ndifferent principles. These remarks\nare called forth by the different expres\nsions of approval and disapproval of\nthe newly launched candidacy of Ex\nSpeaker Paul Clagstont for the gover\nnorship of this state. The Orifino\nTribune pronounces Clagstone\'s can\ndidacy the greatest practical joke\nthaj has ever been perpetrated upon\nthe state of Idaho, while the Moscow\nStar-Mirror says that "Paul Clagstone,\nspeaker of the house of the Tenth\nsession of the Idaho legislature, with\nhis magnificent record for clean poli\ntics! made during that session, fresh in\nthe minds of the people, will make\nthe old liners sit up and take notice."\nThere is beginning to he a rattling\namong the dry bones in the south part\nof the state on the matter of the\nforcement of the pu-e food law.\nCommissioner James H. Wallis is;\ncarting on a campaign of stringent\nlaw enforcement, which will begin\nbelow the Mason and Dixon line in\nS\nen\nthe state, and will be carried north to\nthe B. C. boundary. Already\nher of slaughter houses have been\nclosed and others in better condition\nhave been given a brief period in\nwhich to right themselves from\na num\na san\n. ., .\nIn DOlie the fattening of I\nitary| point.\nhogi on the refuse of slaughter houses,\nhas been prohibited, and stringent j\nrulejt are to be printed and sent out to\nall f^utchers over the state, instructing\nthen|i as what they must do to avoid\nbeing closed down for uncleaniiness.\nI\nI HE Star-Mirror editorially an\nnotices that Moscow is known the\ncountry over as a "newspaper grave\nyard" and that the prevailing opinion\nis that the business men there\nslowj lot, and by lack of patronage kill\nthe papers off. But that it is the in\none\nare a j\ntentjon of that paper to give them\nmort chance to make good, by giving\nthen|i a first-class paper, one that they\ncan feel proud of, and see if they will\nrefojrn.\nFor Sal*.\n1<>0 acres, atS17.50 per acre; 45\nacre!* in crop, one half of which goes\nto buyer.
