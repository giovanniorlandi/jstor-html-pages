But the\ninjunction against the Salem people,\nwhich is the same as the one apiinst\nthe Fairmonters, binders ami restrains\nthe Salemites from doing wihat, it Is\nclaimed, they wanted to do?take away\nthe legal and lawful right of the Fair\nmont company.

Th? team \'him\na reputation for playing good ball on\nits own grounds, but fall* down awuy\nfrom home.\'.. In the game here the Wil\nsonburg boys ncenied to be rattled from\nthe first, but .they would probably have\ndone no better, if tfiey had left those\njags of mineral wator at home.\nThe game was called promptly at 3:30\no\'clock, but it dragged along until 5:30\nand began to hick interest before the\nfirst half of nil the innings were played.\nHie attendance wan fairly good, but\nShinnston seemed to have the crowd from\nthe first, opssibly on account of the\nstrength they mho wed over Wilsonburg\nfrom -the start.\nWilsonburg, though badly beaten, did\nsome very clever work. In one inning\na double play was made by them and\ntwo of the Shinnston fellows were put\nout. At another time one of the Wilson\nburg team made a fine single-hand fly\ncatch, which elicited much applause. The\nteam, as a whole, however, was slow at\nthe bat and deficient in the field. They\nmade only one hit. while Shinnston made\ntwelve.\nThe Shinnston -team was not confined\nto \'home people, but included men from\nMannington. Cameron \' and Clarksburg,\nbesides the boys of the regular Shinns\nton team. The Wilsonburg team was\nmade up exclusively of Wilsonburg boys.\nThe line-up of the victorious team was\nas follows:\nCannon, pitcher: M?*rgan, catcher; 13.\nConoway. first base; 13. Smith, second\nI wise; Sauenet, third base; Lindsay, Short\n?stop; Fred Randall, right field; E. Ran-;\ndally center field; ?!. Hartley, left field, i\nFor Wilsonburg tihe players were as\nfolloavs:\nO. Maxwell, pitcher; Wickewhofer.\ncatcher; McAtee. first l?ase; 13. Maxwell,\nsecond base; Fowler, third base; Kile,\nshort stop; Williaims, right field; fi.\nMaxwell, center field, and Kddy, left\nfield.\nThe score was as follows by innings:\nShinnston 3 5 1 1 020 1 0?13\nWilsonburg 0 0 0 00000000\nThe last half of the ninth inning with\nW ilsonburg at the bat, was rather lively,\nand the real excitement of the day was\nfurnisfhed. The umpire called a man safe\non second on a three-base run on wtiat\nthe Slrinnston team contended was a foul\nball. Shinnston wanted to quit right\nthere and then, unless the decision was\nchanged. While the wrangle was on with\nthe pitcher and catcher Imfh in the mid\ndle of the diamond with the umpire, the\nlatter called hall, ami the Wilsonburg\nman on third base made home safe. The\numpire acknowledged that he called ball,\nbut he stated that he called time im\nmediately afterward. The Wilsonburg\nboys laid down, because he asked that\ntheir man go back to third base. The\ngame ended there, an dthe score was\ngP.\'en to Shinnston just as made by that\nteam.\nELK DISTRICT\nS. S. CONVENTION\nWill Be Held at Horeb Church August 8.\nGood Program.

T. C. Slease A Co.\nNew York, July 29.?American, stocks\nin London are firm with advancing ten\ndency. Quotations are generally one\nfourth to one-half above parity. Rock\nIsland has taken over control of Evans\nvine and Terre Haute from E. S. Hooley.\nIt is said to be on a basis of $50 a\nshare. The government weekly weather\nreport indicates little damage to corn.\nBig June earning are expected for Read\ning and Erie. There is a demand for bi\ntuminous coal in the middle of the week.\nNew York Central and Canadian Pacific\nare both scarce in Joan crowd. The pool\nin Colorado Southern is still intact. Reg\nular dividends have been declared on\n(Jnion Pacific common and preferred. The\nbanks gained from sub-treasurey since\nFriday $800,000.\nChances Against General Advance.\nXew York, July 29.?Chances are\nagainst a general advance in the mar-1\nket beyond the high figures of yester\nday, bo far as the day\'s operations are I\nconcerned. We look for an irregular mar- I\nket, with proba&ly some further liquida\ntion of loans. According "to precedent,\nthe reaction of yesterday was natural\nand it sliould go further. There are\nbull points on .Southern Pacific. Buy\nBaltimore & Ohio. Missouri Pacific or\n(Jnoin Pacific. But we would not buy\nthem except when weak. The market\nstructure has been weakened by the re\nduction of the short interests.\n"Hot Wind" Rumors.\nXew York. July 29.?The bears are\nagain trying to make use of the "foot\nwind" rumors. However, the best au\nthorities agree that we shall harvest a\n"poor crop of corn this year, at least 25\nper <*ent. below the average, and possi\nbly 33 per cent. The question is, if it\nhas not already been over discounted. I\ndo not think that anything in sight will\nchock an irregular upward movement\nthrough August. The September market\nwill be" considered hiter. hTe Sterling\nExchange rate bring New York secura\nblv in sight of gold imports. This, in\naddition to three or four millions en\nroute from Australian and some sub\nstantial movements from the Klondike.\n1 The financial situation is due to gorld\nimports. I consider stocks a purahase\n<?n moderate recessions. Any of the\nstandard issues, even the Industrials, are\ngood, though it would be unwise to touch\nsugar. RJDGELEY.\nBUS FAIRMONT PROPERTY.\nJ.

London was a good\nbuyer, although large traders were by no\nmeans extravagantly bullish in any de\npart mont. They did not seem to bo\'able\nU) dislodge much stock. The decline in\nAtchison was part of a concerted move\nment by some of the large traders against\nBerwind holdings. The attempt seemed\nto be somewhat of a piratical character\nand was not treated seriously by the\n?more important interests. B. R.

They\n4iave gotten more than they bargained |\nfor.\nIn this connect n?n it is well to state,\n?without easting: any retleotions on tin*\neducators of the -late, that resolutions,\nusually passed by institute*. are daxigor\nous even \'to the teachers themselves. Tthe\nmanner of passing resolutions is verj\nmuch subject to eriticisrtn. I "suafly a\ncommittee is appointed to draft a set\nof resolutions, a1 it thinks it is its duty\nto bring in a long list, whether there is\nany necessity or occasion for it or not.\nAs a general thing the institute body\nknows nothing about the nature of tin\nresolutions l?efoVo d\'hey are read by the\ncommittee to the institute. Then, again\nthis is done usually just before tiual\nadjournment, and. -with every on6 eager\nto get away, they art? adopted with a\nrush. A thorough discussion is m.-t in\ndulged in. No one really realizes the\npurport of the resolutions, and as the\nconsequence oft times the teaehers are\nthus committed to policies ami measures\ntliey disapprove of after due study and\nreflection. The uniform state e.vamitra\nlion system seems to be one of t he meas\nures tliey brought about and now repu\ndiate.\nIf the state board has given the teach\ners justice, the public school system has\ncertainly been in weak hands. Tea ch\new who have been regarded the best for\nyears must now step down to the second\nclass. There are but few. according to\nthe result of the examination, who are\nfit to be in a school room as instructor.\nTliis state of affairs is highly improba\nble. and the fault must. He with the state\ngrading board.\nFrom observation it will be seen that\nt\'he branches in which the teachers fell\nlowest, are reading and theory and art.\nNeither are proper branches to do elose\ngrading in. and especially the latter, for\nt\'lie re are many recognized ways, and\nit is a fact, that the art of one exam\niner even would not meet, the approval\nof the others. A great deal of latitude\nshould be given OH this branch anil ex\nperience -should fig-urc many points in\nthis grade.\nIrreparable injury has been done the\npublic school system, for the present year\nat. least.. Teaehers who have taught\nmany years will not teach on Xo. two\nund they can not. l>e expected to do like\nthe old fourth reader said, that i*. "it\nat first you don\'t sueeeed. try. try again."\nAs a consequence, there will not be a\nsuMieicnt number of tea eh ers to open\nup all \'the schools of the county.\nThe next thing is to consiilr .1 rem\nedy. This i-i up to the state superin\ntendent. or the legislature, and the soon\ncr it is found i he bet t er.\nThe.

The Sentinel should\nkeep cool these hot slimmer days, as it\niei dangerous to get ovcr-cxercised on a\nlittle matter that scarcely demands pass\ning notice. I\'p this way, it. is the re\nsolve to keep just ns cool as possible,\nand nothing tne worthy Sentinel says\nwill disturb us in the least.\nITALIAN\nMINER\nDISORDERLY\nOn a Passenger Train and Is Now in Jail\nAwaiting Indictments by the\nGrand Jury.\nCharles At* war*, an Italian miner] from\ndown along the river, is in jail in default\nof a #200 bond to answer an indict merit\nby the grand jury for disorderly con\nduct on a Baltimore & Ohio passenger\ntrain on the Monongaii division Mon\nday afternoon. lie and others were\ndrinking and making a noisy time on\nthe train.
