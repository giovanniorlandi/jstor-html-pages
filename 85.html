        <pre>['Published November, 1945\nFIBER CONTENT IN RELATION TO LENGTH AND AGE \nOF SANSEVIERIA THUNB. LEAVES\' \nJULIAN C. CRANE AND RAUL E. ALONS02 \nTHE possibility of using several species belonging to the genus Sansevieria, commonly termed lengua de vaca (cow tongue) in \nLatin America, as a source of hard fiber suitable for cordage and bag \nmanufacture has been recognized for many years. The fiber, often \nreferred to as bow-string hemp, has never attained commercial importance,\nhowever, due to the lack of technical knowledge regarding \nthe cultural requirements of the plant as well as the problem of fiber \nextraction from the leaves. During a short period in the early part \nof this century, three or four small defibering mills were established \nin various locations in Africa where there were comparatively large \nareas of 5. Ehrenbergii Schweinf growing in the wild state. This industry\nlanguished according to Wigglesworth (9),3 however, because \nof the unsuitability of the fiber as a competitor to sisal and of the fact \nthat the plant, after being cut, produced new leaves very slowly. \nThe 62 species of the genus Sansevieria mentioned in the literature \nare extraordinarily varied in growth habit and appearance. Some \nare miniature plants with thick, fleshy leaves a few inches long as \ncontrasted to those which have flat, thin leaves 4 to 6 feet long. \nOther species are characterized by their single cylindrical leaves in \ncontrast to those which have semi-cylindrical leaves arranged fanlike. \nThere are also aborescent species with leaves arising from a thick \nstem. \nAs might be expected, the numerous species native of Africa, \naccording to Greenway (5), are markedly restricted in their habitat. \nSome grow only in association in extremely desolate country with an \nannual rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, while others are found in the·tropical\nrainforest with an annual rainfall of So inches. Other species are \nfrequently seen growing as the dominate ground cover on coral rock \njust above the high-water mark and frequently deluged with sea.water.\nLikewise, as determined at the Imperial Institute (4), the quality \nof the fiber of the different species varies greatly. On the one extreme \nis Sansevieria guineensis Will d., synonymous to 5. trijaciata according \nto Brown (3), with fine, lustrous, strong fibers of even diameter; \nwhile on the other is 5. Ehrenbergii with fibers of marked variation in \ndiameter, those from the interior of the leaf being extremely fine \nwhile those from the exterior are very coarse. \n\'Joint contribution from the Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations, U. S. \nDept. of Agriculture, and the Cuban Agricultural Experiment Station.

Any \nbasic information, therefore, on the utilization of this plant for the \nproduction of fiber is useful. This paper deals with the results obtained\nfrom preliminary investigations conducted on three species of \nSansevieria at the Cuban Agricultural Experiment Station. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nThe predominate species of Sansevieria in Cuba isS. guineensis with S. zeylanica \nWilld., perhaps, ranking second. Ornamental patches of S. cylindrica Bojer and \nS. intermedia Brown also exist but only to a very limited extent. \nBefore establishing new experimental plantings and initiating cultural investigations\nwith Sansevieria, it was considered desirable to determine the relative \nmerits, particularly the yield of fiber, of the three most prevalent species in Cuba. \nLeaves of S. guineensis, S. zeylanica, and S. cylindrica, about 2 years old and of \napproximately the same length, were harvested at the Atkins Institution of the \nArnold Arboretum at Central Soledad, Cuba. The three species had been planted \nabout the same time and were growing in the woods next to each other under \napproximately identical environmental conditions. The leaves were transported \nto the Experiment Station where they were weighed, retted in water, and the yield \nof fiber determined. \nTo determine the association betwe.en length of leaf and fiber content, a 7- to \n8-year-old planting of Sansevieria guineensis, growing in rather dense shade in the \narboretum at the Cuban Agricultural Experiment Station, was used. The planting \nwas divided into nine plots, each covering an area of 45 square feet and containing \nabout the same stand of plants. The plots were harvested separately by cutting all \nleaves at ground level with sharp knives. Harvesting of all plots was done during \nthe first week of July I944· After being harvested, the leaves were taken to the \nlaboratory where they were classified and counted according to length, and each \nlength group was weighed separately. They then were passed through squeeze \nrollers in order to break the relatively thick epidermal layer and thereby to \nfacilitate the biological retting process. Afterwards they were tied in bundles and \nsubmerged in a retting tank for about 15 days. When the fiber came free of pulp \nand cementing materials, it was thoroughly washed, dried in an oven, and• \nweighed. Samples of leaves from each length group were dried to constant weight \nin an oven in order to determine the moisture content. \nAlthough length of leaf is a partial criterion with respect to age for about the \nfirst two years, after this time all leaves reach their inherent length under a given \nset of environmental conditions; and a planting of Sansevieria may consist of \nleaves of about the same length but differing in age from I to 3 or 4 years. \nIn order to determine the degree of association between age of leaf and the fiber \ncontent, an arbitrary classification was made based on morphological appearance \nof the leaves. The writers observed that the short basal leaf sheaths of Sansevieria \nguineensis remained green for a period of about a year, after which they turned \nbrown and ceased to function. The dead leaf sheaths generally remained attached\nto the plant the second year; then they gradually underwent decomposi-\ntion and were removed from the plant by wind and rain. Three groups of leaves \ndiffering in age were set up as follows: Leaves with green basal leaf sheaths, approximately\nI year old; leaves with dried and withered basal leaf sheaths, approxi-\nmately 2 years old; and leaves with no basal leaf sheaths, more than 2 years old. \nUsing this classification during harvesting, leaves having approximately the \nsame length but differing with respect to appearance and presence of the basal \n', 'CRANE AND ALONSO: FIBER CONTENT OF SANSEVIERIA 955 \nleaf sheaths, were selected at random and cut at ground level from another planting\nof Sansevieria guineensis. This planting was growing in the arboretum under \nslightly different environmental conditions from the one mentioned previously \nin that it received the morning sunshine. Fiber and moisture determinations were \nmade according to the method stated above. \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nData in Table r on the fiber yield of the three main species of \nSansevieria in Cuba grown under approximately identical environmental\nconditions show that 5. guineensis contained 2.67% fiber of \n· the green weight of its leaves as compared to 2.r6% and 1.53% for \n5. cylindrica and 5. zeylanica, respectively. Although 5. cylindrica \nproduced more fiber per leaf than 5. guineensis, the former species \nhas been observed to grow considerably slower than the latter and \nis known to produce fewer leaves per unit of land. Although the \naverage weight per leaf of 5. zeylanica was 36.5 grams more than the \naverage weight per leaf of 5. guineensis, it yielded approximately r% \nless fiber. Under Cuban conditions, 5. guineensis appears to be better \nsuited for the production of fiber than either 5. cylindrica or 5. \nzeylanica. \nTABLE I.-Fiber determinations on samples of Sansevieria guineensis, S. zeylanica \nand S. cylindrica harvested at Central Soledad, Cuba, each sample composed of \nIS leaves about 4 feet long. \nTotal Weight Weight of Fiber Percentage Sample green per leaf, dry fiber, per leaf, fiber of No. weight, green \ngrams grams grams grams weight \nS. guineensis \nI 2,999 I53-26 60.73 4-04 2.64 \n2 2,086 I39.06 56.54 3-76 2.7I \n-----------Average\n2,072 I46.I6 58.63 3-90 2.67 \nS. zeylanica \n2,833 I88.86 41.99 2.79 1.48 \n2 2,647 I76-46 42-35 2.82 1.59 \n-----Average\n2,740 I82.66 42.I7 2.80 1.53 \nS. cylindrica \nI 3.578 238·53 76.86 5-I2 2.I4 \n2 3,250 2I6.66 71.43 4-76 2.I9 \n-----Average\n3,414 227-59 74-I4 4-94 2.I6 \nThe association between length of leaf of 5ansevieria guineensis \nand the fiber and moisture content is shown in Fig. r. With an increase\nin length of leaf, there was a progressive increase in the per-\ncentage fiber content. The fiber content increased from a low of 1.5% \nin leaves of the shortest group to a high of 2.5% in leaves of the longest\ngroup, with the greatest increase occurring in those leaves be-\ntween the 3 7- to 48-inch and 49- to 6o-inch length groups. The upper \n', '956 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nlimit of 2.5% lies between the figures presented by Barrett (r), in \nPorto Rico and Toro (7) in Mexico, who reported the fiber yield to \nbe between 2 and 3% of the green weight of the leaves. \n...-.. \n12\nw \n(.) \na:: \nw \na... \n3.5 \nFIBER PER LEAF \n2.5 \n7 \n6 \n........... \nU) \n:iE \nCi \n• <.!) \n,......---•5..._., \nFIBER IN LEAVES// ,..• -~ \n~ (PERCENT)"\'-. ~ \n~ a:: \n~2.0 /. 4~ \n~ ./ . ; \n~ 1.5•~ 3~ \nI \n·~ \n1.0 .............. \n\'"" • MOIS~URE \nIN LEAVES \n"-.~PE?ENT) \n0.5/0 ~. \noi I I 1~0 \n2 \no-24 25-36 37-49 49-60 61-72 \nLENGTH OF LEAVES (INCHES) \n0 _. \nw \n>~\n93:7 1-\n.2 \nw \n(.) \na:: w \na. ...._.,. \n92.7 (/) \nliJ \n~ \nliJ _. \n91.7 2 \nliJ \na:: \n:::::> \n~ \n90.7 ~ \nFIG. I.-Fiber and moisture content in relation to length of Sansevieria guineensis \nleaves. \n', 'CRANE AND ALONSO: FIBER CONTENT OF SANSEVIERIA 957 \nWith this progressive increase in fiber content, there was a slightly \ngreater decrease in the moisture content of the leaves. The moisture \ncontent decreased from a high of 93.2% in leaves o to 24 inches long \nto a low of 90.7% in leaves 61 to 72 in~hes in length. As was expected, \nthe yield of fiber per leaf increased with an increase in leaf length. \nThe weight of fiber produced per leaf made a gradual increase \nfrom 0.44 gram in leaves o to 24 inches long to where the leaves were \n3 7 to 48 inches in length followed by a sharp increase to 5. r 6 grams \nin leaves 49 to 6o inches long. This rapid increase in fiber produced \nper leaf is the direct result of a similar increase in the total green \nweight per leaf as shown in Table 2. From these data it appears that \ninS. guineensis, like other plants, the growth rate during the formative\nstages is comparatively slow but speeds up during the elongative \nperiod and then decreases during maturation. The total weight of \ndry clean fiber produced per acre from this planting was 3, 2 ro pounds, \nas shown in Table 2. \nBarrett (1), Whitford (8), and Blockman (2) have estimated the \nyield of fiber per acre to be between 3,ooo and 3,500 pounds, while \nParsons (6) reported the crop would yield 1o,ooo pounds of clean \nfiber per acre.

Until a planting of Sansevieria \non a commercial basis has grown for perhaps 4 or 5 years, doubt \nexists as to whether, even under optimum conditions, it would produce\nmore than half of the fiber obtained from the planting used in \nthis study. This view point is corroborated by the data presented by \nToro (7), who calculated that between 1,338 and 1,695 pounds of dry \nfiber per acre may be obtained from a commercial planting the third \nyear after it is established. Sansevieria is a comparatively slow-growing\nplant, at least from the standpoint of producing new leaves from \nthe rhizomes; and q, minimum of 3 or 4 years would be required for a \n', '958 jOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nnew planting to produce I 5 leaves per square foot as was the case in \nthis investigation (Fig. 2). \nTABLE 3.-Percentage fiber and moisture in different aged Sansevieria guineensis \nleaves of about the same length. \nGreen Dry Mois- Dry Fiber of \nLeaf appearance and weight, weight, ture, weight green \napproximate age grams grams % of fiber, weight, \ngrams % \n--~----With\ngreen leaf sheaths, r year .. 1,392 92 93-4 20.88 1.5 \nWith dead leaf sheaths, 2 year_s 2,984 224 \nI \n92.5 47·74 I.6 \nWithout leaf sheaths, over 2 \nyears . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,482 200 91.9 47.15 1.9 \nData presented in Table 3 show that as Sansevieria guineensis \nleaves increased in age, the percentage of fiber likewise increased \nwith an accompanying decrease in moisture. Differences in fiber and \nmoisture percentage data presented in Fig. I and Table 3 for separate \nplantings of the same species, are due, perhaps, to slight differences \nin environmental conditions under which the two plantings were \ngrowing, as mentioned previously. Leaves from the latter plot were \nharvested following a rainy period which might be responsible for the \nhigher moisture percentage. \nProblems such as method and time of harvesting this crop and the · \nresultant effect upon subsequent growth and yield still remain unsolved.\nShould the practice of cutting all leaves at ground level not \nprove harmful to the planting, then harvesting may be easily accomplished\nby using a standard mowing machine with a ]Jinder attach-\nment. The belief is, however, that such a severe harvesting method \nmay result over a period of years in the eventful destruction of the \nplanting and, perhaps, the harvesting only of leaves of a given length \nor longer will have to be resorted to. This will necessitate the design \nand construction of a machine with an adjustable mechanism for removing\nthe leaves of a desired height, such as 36 inches and longer, \nwhich, under the conditions of this experiment, produced approximately\n8s% of the total fiber obtained as shown in Table 2. A machine \nof this type might consist of a series of rollers turning in opposite \ndirections and mounted perpendicular to the upright leaves which \nwould, upon contact with the terminal ends of the leaves, break them \nloose from the underground rhizomes. The point of attachment of the \nleaves to the rhizome has proved to be the location where the break \nmost generally occurs. Harvesting by this method would consist of \nremoving only the longer leaves while the shorter ones would be left \nfor the next harvest. \nFrom the data presented in Tables 2 and 3, it would appear that \nfor maximum yields of fiber per unit of land, harvesting should be \ndelayed until the leaves are over 2 years old. From an economic \nstandpoint, however, it is questionable whether the increase in yield \nobtained by delaying harvesting until this time would be profitable. \nCertainly, time of harvest with respect to ag~ .and morphological \n', 'CRANE AND ALONSO: FIBER CONTENT OF SANSEVIERIA 959 \nFIG. 2.-Sansevieria guineensis growing in the arboretum at the Cuban Agricultural\nExperiment Station. The tallest leaves are about 4 feet in length. \ndevelopment of the leaves would have a pronounced effect upon the \nproduction and growth of new leaves. Another factor which undoubtedly\nwill govern the optimum time for harvesting is the asso-\nciation between fiber quality and age of leaf. The writers have obobserved\nthat with advancing age of leaf the fiber becomes more \ncoarse and harsh. There is reason to believe that tensile strength and \n', '960 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nother factors which make up quality also undergo considerable \nchange. \n· Environment, particularly in reference to shade, is another factor \nwhich will require scientific experimentation· before the· technical \nproblems of 5ansevieria fiber production are solved. Although the \nreports in the literature ~re quite conflicting in this respect, it is \ngenerally agreed that most species of 5ansevieria, in varying degree, \nare shade-loving plants, and that better growth and production of \nleaves is obtained from plants growing in partial or full shade than \nfrom plants growi11g in sunlight. \nDefibering trials of this plant, using equipment designed for \ndefibering henequen. have been quite successful in Cuba. Recent \nexperimental trials in Florida, with a somewhat different machine \nwhich was designed and built by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, have \nalso been encouraging. \nSUMMARY \nInvestigations were conducted at the Cuban Agricultural Experiment\nStation on 5ansevieria guineensis, 5. zeylanica, and 5. cylindrica \nto determine the comparative fiber content of their leaves as well as \nthe relationship of fiber content to length and age of 5. guineensis \nleaves. \nThe average fiber content of leaves which had grown under practically\nidentical environmental conditions and were approximately the \nsame length and age was found to be 2.67, 2.16, and 1.53% for Sansevieria\nguineensis, 5. cylindrica, and 5. zeylanica, respectively. \nWith an increase in length of leaf of 5ansevieria guineensis";. there \nwas a progressive increase in the percentage fiber contenf accompanied\nby a progressive decrease in the percentage of moisture. \nData, based on morphological development of the leaves, are presented\nwhich also show that there is an increase in the percentage of \nfiber accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of moisture. \nFrom a 7- to 8-year-old planting of 5ansevieria guineensis, 3,210 \npounds of dry, clean fiber were produced per acre but, on a commercial\nbasis, doubt exists as to whether more than half of this \namount would be produced annually at the end of the fourth or fifth \nyear. \nA short discussion is presented dealing with some of the problems \nwhich need scientific investigation before the technicalities of \nSansevieria fiber production are solved. \nLITERATURE CITED \n1.
