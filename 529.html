There were two men\nin the room, one standing close fo\nthe huller being badly burned.\nEvery thing in the room was dry\nand most of it highly iuflaraable.\nThe sixteen linters were all run\nning, and it wa the work of a\nmoment for the flames to take\npossession of the whole room.\nFortunately the mill is equipped\nwith splendid fire-fighting apparat\nus. There i a large tank and a\nforce pump, with three hose in the\nhouse.\nThe presence of mind and the\ngood judgement of the men im-\nmpHifltplv broiii?ht all forces to\nbear to extinguish the flames and\nin thirty minutes the fire was uu\nder control. The men did splen\ndid work fighting fire and to this\nfact alone is due the preservation\nof the entire mill from destruc\ntion.\nAlmost evcrvthine inside the\nlint room was damaged, the con\nvevors and end of the reel, the\nwood pulleys, the belting and the\nroof of the room, all sunered\ngreatly. The belting is a great\nloss. The officers of the company\nare unable to estimate the lo.ss\nwith exactness, but it will proba\nbly amount to from $3000 to S3500\nIt will probably be four orfive\ndays U-fore the mill will he in shape\nto resume operation. New belting\nwas ordered by wire last night\nJust as soon as the insurance ad\njusters arrive and complete their\nwork, the work of repairing will\nbegin. The loss is covered by in\nsurance held by companies repre\nsented by Dy wer & Owsley and\nJarboe & Cannon.\nNo definite cause can be given\nfor the explosion. It will be re\nmembered that the fire which de\nstroyed the mill in Mtrch, 1902,\noriginated from the same source.\nIt is said that nine-tenths of the\noil mill fires are due to this\ncouse.\nSOROSIS QUESTIONS.\nDecember 9, 1903.\nLeader Mrs. J.

Seats on\nsale Saturday at Haltom & Owsley\nJewelry Store.\nTHE LABOR PROBLEM A\nPOINT OF VIEW.\nThe labor problem is one of the\ngreatest that confronts our present\ncivilization. In one sense, it is not\na new problem; the relation of em\nployer and employee has been one\npresenting certain difficulties in\nevery stage of history. But in its\npresent aspect, the question is a\ndistinctly modern one, growing out\nof the wonderful industrial develop\nment of the past ceuturj .- In its\nessence, the problem is simply one\nof the equitable distribution of\nwealth. More specifically the\nquestion is, "how may the laborer\nobtain a large proportional share of\nthe results of his labor?\' \'\nJn the- discussion of this ques\ntion, it is important above all\nthings to have a sane poiut of\nview.\nThere is one point of view that\nof certain of the capitalistic class,\nby no means all which contends\nthat there is no problem; that the\npresent situation is all right and\nno re-adjustment is needed. All\ndiscussion of the question is to be\ndeprecated as fostering socialistic\nand anarchistic doctrines that are\nantagonistic to the real interests of\nindustry and progress.\nAnother point of view that of\nthe extremist labor leader asserts\nthat the present situation is all\nwrong; that the greed of the cap\nitalistic class has passed all bounds\nof endurance, and radical steps\nmust be taken to overthrow the\nexisting order. Incessant agita\niion ii the duty of all who would\ns:e matters righted, and all sorts of\ninflammatory speeches are in order\ntill that time.\nA third point of view recognizes\nthe existence pf the problem and\nthe necessity for certciu re-adjustments,\nb it bi lls H at the discus\nsion of the problem can accomplish\no good; rather, by inflaming das\nfellings, will work harm.\nA careful survey of these three\npoints of view, will reveal that\ncone are tenable. To lake the\nfirst is to deny the plainest facts in\nthe industrial history of the past\ntliree-quarters Ot a century and to\nbe J blind to the mosi patent facts\nthat exist today. To take the\necond, is to deny the great contri\nbution that has been made to onr\npresent civilization by the employ\ning class; to ov:rlo?k the fact that\nthe csaditi it ti \' itorer is bet\nter today liiSiS h t.tr wai in the\nif! rc\'..eivi s iv4 iii.y a ianr\nt-ital amount ,f the pr.hxi.U of ii-d.t-itry,\nbut n\'-o a larger pnj",r\ntional amount. These facts can be\ndemonstrated from statistics by\nanyone who cares to take the\ntrouble.\nThe third attitude,, that, of the\nultra conservative class is likewise\nopen to objection. It denies the\npossibility of fair and intelligent\ndiscussion of the question. It\noverlooks the great pirt played in\nthe settlement of all great public\nquestions by free de bate. j\nA saner view will recognize that .\nthere is a problem and that it is a ;\ngreat one. It will recognize that\nlabor lias wrongs to be righted. It\nwill also give to capital the credit\nthat is its due; it will perceive the\ngreat benefits that have inured ot\nthe lalwrin? class from the accinii-1\nulations of capi al that have made\ntheir la!or more productive. It 1\nwill not be revolutionary or au-\nin any sense. It will not\nseek to stir up class prejudices. It\nwill welcome fair and free discus\nsion, that is based, not upon emo\ntion, but upon hard facts. It will\nabandon the narrow attitude of\nthose who fail to see but one side\nof a question, and will be liberal\nenough to see that there is always\nanother side. It will deprecate\nonly the discussion w hich is un\nfair and destructive.\n"Check and Ems." Wc- guarantee every watch we sell\nThe Hon. li. Insriils, of Cln-jto give satisfaction.

BIS!I.)1"3 RESOLUTION.\nAlderman Bishop introduced a\nresolution a the last Council meet\ning which ought to call forth con\nsiderable discussion.\nBriefly stated; the resolution\ncalls for a $20,000 Carnegie library\ninstead of a $10,000 one, as here\ntofore-proposed. Mr. Bishop thinks\nthat a $10,000 library will not be\ncommensurate with the needs of\nthe city, especially, when the\ngrowth that must come within the\nnext few years is taken into con\nsideration.\nThe question is a pertinent one,\ninvolving, as it does, some of the\nhighest interests of the conuinity.\nOne thing is certain we ought to\nhave the \'\' library. If this new\ncountry is to measure up to the\nstandards established in the older\nstates, we must maintain the in\nstitutions for promoting the highest\ndegree of intellectual culture.\nAmong these institutions, libraries\nand schools stand pre-eminent.\nWe have the schools; we must have\nthe public library.\nAway up in New England, where\nna ture has been most niggard in her\ngift, scarcely a town of 3000 inhab\nitants and upwards can be found\nthat it is not adorned with a plen\ndid public library building. Noth\ning speaks better for a town. The\nwest is big and rich and she can\nafford all that an eastern town can\nafford and more.\nThe necessity for a library of\nsome kind being recognized, the\nquestion as to how much shall be\nexpended for it is one on which\neveryone is at liberty to entertain\nhis own opinion. It is to be hoped,\nhowever, that those who have the\ngreatest interests at stake and\nthose concerned most deeply in\ncarrying out this great public en\nterprise will discuss it freely. In\ndeed, it is a question for every\ncitizen to consider and discuss.\nthe c.rcle of loafers tuar had gather\ned to talk over the public and pri\nvate events of the nation, state,\ntown and village. One old fellow,\nwhom I formerly knew well, when\nthere was a lull in the conversation,\n\'caned over and said that he wanted\nto ask me a question.\n"\'I want to know," said h? \'if k\nis true that you get a salary of $10,\noco a year.\'\n"I admit. ed that I did make as\nmuch as that in twelve months.\n" \'Well,\'\' said he, "it h remarka\nble what cheek and brass will do.\' "\nOn Lord Aberdeen,\nA characteristic remark of Mr.\nChoate was made about Lord Aber\ndeen at a dinner in New York,\nwhere the tiien governor general of\nCanada was the principal guest, ap\npearing in kilts, in honor of liis\nScotch entertainers. Aberdeen bad\nmade a neat speech, and the p\nplause had barely subiided .nen\nChoate was introduced ...d pro\nceeded to say complini! .ary things\nof the List speaker a. .J to declare\nthat if he had known that lie wu\nto be permitted to sit next to his\n86-87\nJkwki.ky Everything up-to-date\nin design and properly priced.\nHaltom & Owsley. 86-87\nAUCTIONEER.\nV.

It was audacious, but the kilt\ned guest was soonest to catch its\nhumor and led the laughter it produced.\nI Cancer Increasing ?\nThere is a feeling of great uneasi\nness in England over some statis\ntics that were recently published\nabout the increase of cancer in Eng\nland. The death rate from that\ndisease in 1890 was sixty-eight per\nsons in every 100,000 inhabitants,\nbut in 1900 it was eighty-three per\nsons in every 100,000. Besides, the\nratio of deaths from cancer to\nthose from all other causes, among\npersons over 35 years of acre,- was\nonly one out of twenty in 1890, but\none out of twelve in 1900. These\nfigures have given rise to much\nalarm, but a consei vative student\nof mortality says that the increased\nrate is probably due to the fact that\nvital statistics are becoming more\naccurate every year, and are now\ngathered from (daces from which no\nreports formerly came.\n0 ,\nImpressionism,\nHere is another characteristic\ntory of Whistler, the artist, one\nwhich was current a year or two\nback in the Latin quarter of Paris,\nOnce or twice a week Whistler went\nto a certain atelier to criticise and\noffer suggestions upon the work of\ntue students there. One of these,\nt young American girl, had painted\na portrait in what she believed the\ntruest unpessiomstic style. When\nWhistler came for his next view he\nitopped tdiort before this canvat,\nwhile the student waited in anxiety\nfor his comment. The master\npaused a moment, and then said, in\nhis most caustic tones: "You say\nthat you paint what you see. Oh,\nLord ! what a shock when one sees\nwhat you paint !" and passed on.\nMark Twain\' Joke on the Rector.\nBishop Doane was at one time\nthe rector of an Episcopal church\nin Hartford, and the services at\nthis church Mark Twain would oc\ncasionally attend. Twain one Sun\nday played a joke upon the rector.\n"Dr. Doane," he said at the end of\nthe service, "1 enjoyed your ser\nmon this morning. I welcomed it\nlike an old friend. I have, you\nknow, a book at home containing\nevcrv word of it." "You have not,"\nsaid Dr. Doane. "I have so," said\nthe lvmiorist. "Well, send that\nbook to me. I\'d like to see it." "I\'ll\nend it," Twain replied. And the\nnext mommg he sent an unabridg\ned dictionary to the rector.\nThe Old Knox Mansion.\nAttorney General Knox, the\nPittsburg member of President\nRoosevelt\'s official family, virtually\n, , , \' , becomes a resident of Philadelphia\nwarded by express by W oodruff and by acquirinR the Mauhews manon\nue aiso iook a large numoer ot re-: at Vallev Force, where Lafavette\nports to look over on his trip home, j had his headquarters with Wash-\nBefore leaving, he said he ex-\' ington during the Revolution.
