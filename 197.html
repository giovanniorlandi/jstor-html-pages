Your dog dees not re\ngard! your clothes nor explore your pockets. lie takes you on faith\nblind faith\'; you are liis king, incapable of wrong. He rends his heaven\non earth in your approving countenance.\nXi rib\' on or rrcda can take the measure of the scm.\':iv.nt of vhc\ntrue dog lover toward his most faithful friend of all. W hen the rest of\ntine world is cold and ihard. his dog will\' still rejoice to meet him- when\nhe comes \'home at night. His dog will think no evil, wlxitevcr tne mas\nter may do.

Roth were\nhuman an1 made mistakes. The mistakes are now forgotten and the\nnames of Washington and Lincoln stand for all that is good and true,\nand the hearts of a grateful people go out to them in hero worship.\nWilson has made mistakes to err is human but his successful ef\nforts so far to keep this nation in the paths of peace deserve eemmen\ndation instead of vilification from the Republican press.\noo\nTHE BOY PROBLEM.\nOur chief weakness in dealing with the boy, is forgetting that we\nwere once boys ourselves.\nThe average, wide-awake, Jiealthy, worth-while boy is enough to\nidYivc a strong man to drink but at that, ihe is no worse than his old man\nwad.\nMother can\'t do it al1 ami, besides, the boy is watching father. Tie\nis looking for an excuse to do this and do that, and do the other thing\nthat he ought not do, and so ihe apes father, quite naturally.\nIf father would pay as much attention to the boys as he does to t\'lie\npigs that roott in the barnyard, or the sheep that gambol in the meadows,\nhe would know where they are all the time.\nA father and iHis boys should be "pals." A boy is- a sensitive plant,\nand very (human, and you simply cannot tyrannize and Wse him. and\nIhope to hold him level. \'\nIf we were to undertake to answer the question, "how to save t!ie\nboy," and formulate a reply in one sentence that would so\'ve all the boy\nproblems in the world, it would be this:\nTeach him the saving habit.\nThe saving habit is a saving grace.\nIt makes a boy manly: it gives him self-respect and tilie confidence\nof others; it prevents him spending ibis- money foolishly.\nSpending money foolishly is the beginning of every downfall.\nIf a boy is taught to be thrifty he will hardly form bad habits.\nBad habits call for the unwise use of money.\nHelp the boy get money sense, which is just good common sense.\nTeaclh him that "planted" dollars will grow, and come back with\ntheir increase.\nConvince him that "soaring" dollars will fly, never to return.\nShow him that a savings account is the guideboard to success.\nPersuade him that his bank Vook should be ibis text book.\nTeach him early the value of of money, help him earn ami save,\nand nine times out of ten you\'ve got him and the problem is solved.\nS.
