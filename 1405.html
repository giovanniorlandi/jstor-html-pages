O. Morse,\nfather of the girl, went to look for\nGilbert, and reason with him. Going\nthe wrong way, Morse missed\nGilbert, and twenty minutes later,\nwhile still in search of the youth,\nwas told that he had shot his daughter.\nThe father rushed to the scene\nand the fact that he could find no\none to furnish him with a pistol was\nall that prevented a double tragedy.\nOn the hot summer night Miss\nMorse and several young friends\nwent to Compostella bridge for a\nbreath of air from across the water.\nThey were conversing on the bridge\nwhen young Gilbert approached.\nMiss Morse\'s escort, W.

The Supreme\nCourt denied a writ of error\non Gilbert\'s appeal, and Governor\nSwanson. who had erantod n ii mopoiiu\nr spites to permit court action, refused\nto interfere further.\nGilbert\'s parents spent their all\nin an effort to save his life, even\nmortgaging their bods to raise money\nwith which to carry the fight to\nthe higher courts.

MARCH 26,1909.\nAVOID BENZOATE OF SSDA. I\nRecently much has been said\nand written about the use of\nbenzoate of soda as a preservative\nof food. Many learned experts\nha\\e declared that it is injurious\nto the human system,\nwhile others maintain that it is\nharmless. But whether injurious !\nor not, the fact is established\nthat the use of benzoate of soda\nas a food preservative is unnecessary\nexcept in cases where\nit is sought to preserve impure,\ndecaying materials that should\nnot be taken into the human\nsystem. Under the pure food\nand drugs act passed by Congress\nin 1906, as a result of the\nunhealthy, filthy conditions revealed\nby the federal investiga- |\ntion of certain canneries, packing\nhouses and other food manufacturing\nplants, it is required\nthat when benzoate of soda is\nused in any food pioJuct the\nlabel must indicate its presence.\nBut the manufacturers of goods\ncontaining benzoate of soda are\nan ingenious set, so in apprising\nthe public that the drug is pres- !\nent in their products very smajl,\nobscure type is used. They know\nthat drugs are not food and that\nthe intelligent citizen does not\ncare to drug himself or his family\naccording to the prescription of\nmanufacturers who are spt lin tn\nsupply the public with foods.\nBenzoate of soda may or may\nnot be injurious to health ?that\nis a mooted question ?but it is\ncertain that its use is never re- i\nsorted to in factories which do\nnot permit unsanitary practices. ;\nOne can always, however, avoid\nthe drug and the more or less\nunwholsome character of foods\nin which it is used as a preservative\nby examining all food labels\ncarefully.\nMR. SWEARINOEN AQAINST IT. |\n\'\nThe Times is pleased to know j\nthat its views in opposition to a\ncompulsory education law for1\nSouth Carolina arc shared by the j\ndistinguished State superintend- j\nent of education, Mr. J. E. |\nSwearingen. This is a matter i\nwhich Mr. Swearingen evidently \'\nhas given much intelligent\nthought, for he discusses the\nproposition in a way that leads\none to believe he has given it1\ndue consideration. The day may\n/ ?mA whAn />nmnnlcnrv r>r?ni^Qtinr>\nwill be a good thing for this;\nState, but that day is so far in\nthe future that it seems misdi- j\nrected effort to urge it at this\ntime. It is a matter which the\'\npeople are entitled to pass upon\nbefore it is adopted as a policy\nof the Commonwealth, for it\nundoubtedly will mean increased *\ntaxation for the white citizenship\nof the State with whatever\nbenefits are to be derived therefrom\ngoing to the negro children\nin greater proportion than to the i\nsons and daughters of those who\nwill bear the burden of making\nthe law effective. South Carolina\nis the last State in the i\nUnion, with the possible exception\nof Mississippi, which should ;\nconsent to the passage of such a\nlaw, for with our overwhelming\npreponderance of negroes it is\nnot problematical as to what the\nresult will be if the law is impartially\nenforced, and if it is\nnot the purpose of the advocates\nof compulsory education to make <\nthe law apply alike to white and\ncolored children-and some of\nthe adfroetaes, at \'east, so ad\nwtimffib such law should be\nh ifllft Pit\' the statute books. No\noSBttne opinion is worth consifoing\nArgues that our educa-!\ntidMg^kilities are what they\nsh<^H^Abut surely the people\no<f ?fe^.i*ite are resourceful\nenol^^Hftdevise some way to\neduc^^^^Bwhite boys and girls ?\nwithBp"iaM|ngering the welfare;\nof tU^^^nnonwealth and im- i\nposingH^Hhem selves financial\nburdeyMapjfch they cannot in.\nreason iNH^kected to assume.\nBut wajHBd out to quote\'\nfrom tn^^^wiew of the\'Statu\n^uperinuMp^f education, who!\nsaid, one or two\nt*. ?*??\nphases of the matter:\n\' \'What is the sense of enacting\na general compulsory education\nlaw in this State when there\nis no way that can be worked\nout now of providing the proper\nschools for the children after you\nmake provision for compelling\nthem to attend school? The\nschool statistics of the State\nshow that in some of the counties\nthe average school term is\neleven to twelve weeks, in spite\nof the fact that there are plenty\nof children of school age to attend.\nSome districts in the State\nare financially and otherwise\nready for such a system, but\nothers are not, and it would be\ne i:_u j._ f - i ?\nluuusii uu lorce me system on\nthose sections not ready, and\nwhich do not want it.\n*\'I certainly do not advocate\na compulsory system for any\nclass. It has been argued that\ncompulsory education should be\nprovided lor the mill people to\nthe exclusion of other classes of\npeople. I think such a law would\nbe a discrimination that would\nnot only be unjust, but very unwise.\nThe mill managements\nwoulu oopose it and the consequent\nfriction brought about\nwould result in more harm than\ngood. The only real dilference\nthere is in this State between\nmill people and people who live\non the farms is that the former\nlive together and the latter\nseparated. For practically all\nthe mill operatives in this State\ncome from the farms."\nTRUST TARIFF REVISION.\nThe Republican majority in\nCongress started out with the\ndeliberate purpse of deceiving\nthe people in regard to revising\nthe tariff. Instead of lowering\nthe various schedules as per their\nante-election promises, it is now\napparent that the revision generally\nwill be upward in the interest\n* 1 4. 1- - *\nui uic irusts ana cor]>orations\nand that the great mass of the\npeople are not to be benefited\neven infinitesimally by the legislation.\nLittle wonder, therefore,\nthat the Democratic members of\nthe ways and means committee\nof Congress in submitting the\nminority report on the Payne\nbill arraigned it as "crude, indefinite,\nsectional and prohibitive"\nand assert that it will increase\nthe cost of living.\n"The treatment of the farmer\nby this bill is along the same\nlines as have characterized the\nRepublican methods in the past,"\nsays the report. "He gets practically\nno relief, and the laborer\nand producer have greater burdens\nimposed upon them. Every\narticle of food the laborer must\nhave to live comfortably is heavily\ntaxed; even the salt on his table\nis not exempt.\n\'That the bill is a sectional one\nis shown by the failure of the\nmajority of the committee to lift\nany burden whatever from the\nshoulders of the Southern farmer.\nThe grower of cotton must\nsell his product in the open\nmarxeps ot the world. In\norder, however, to benefit the\nmanufacturer of cotton, the Republican\nparty makes him pay a\nheavy tax on every pound of it\nthat is exported and comes back\ninto the United States in the\nshape of manufactured goods.\nThus he sells in free trade markets\nand buys in a protected\nmarket. Not only have these\nburdens not been lifted but additional\nones have been placed\nupon him.\n"Cotton hose has fallen under\ntheir greedy gaze and the tax on\nit, already too high, has been\ngreatly increased. Cotton goods\nare more generally used than any\nother class of goods by the masses\nof the American people and\nevery cent of duty laid on such\nfabrics is an additional tax on\nthe people least able to pay it."\nIt is a matter for regret that\nFort Mill, the one town in the\nfair Southland which possesses\na monument to the faithful\nwomen of the Confederacy, has\nnot yet made a donation to the\ngeneral fund for the proposed\nConfederate ladies\' monument\nbeing raised throughout the\nState. We cannot believe that\nour people will let the opportunity\npass to further honor the women\nwho endured so much suffering\nthat their husbands and sons\nmight proclaim themselves victors\nin the contest between the\nStates. Contributions to the\nfund should be forwarded to\nThe State, Columbia, S. C.\nThe Times is of the opinion\nthat Fort Mill\'s one and only\nchance for cement pavements\nand macadam streets is a tax\nlevy sufficient to pay for such\nimprovements.

In making up the comnittees,\nit is stated on reliable auhority\nthe speaker will consult with\n\'every member of the House who c\niesires to discuss assignments with i\nhim." This means that Minority c\nLeader Clark will not enjoy the prlv- c\nliege accorded his predecessor, John r\nSharp Williams, of selecting the l\nminortiy members. 1\nThe attitude taken by the Demo- 1\ncrats at a caucus held this evening 1\nafter the House adjourned is In sharp I\nconflict with the new policy of ?\nSpeaker Cannon. A resolution was ,\nadopted to prevent members of the\nminority accepting committee as- 1\nsignments without the approval of\nMinority iJeader Clark. The resolu- 1\ntlon reads: ,\n"Resolved. That it is the sense of\nthe Democratic caucus that no Democrat\nshould accept appointment on\nany committee without the previous\napproval of the Democratic leader."\nThis was adopted by a vote of 185\nto 1, one member voting present.\nPrevious to the vote, however, a\nnumber of members had left the\ncaucus.\nOne hundred and sixty-six Democrats\nbound themselves to support\nChamp Clark of Missouri in his tight\non the rules of the House.

Let\n| us close up our ranks, present a\nsolid front and demonstrate to the\nworld that we are worthy of the\nhigh vocation wherein we are called."\nThe resolution adopted was that\noffered by Representative Underwood\nand in effect bound the members of\nthe caucus to support Mr. Clark In\nhis efforts to procure the adoption\nof the plan agreed ;upon by the\nDemocratic leaders and the insurgents\'\nsteering committee.\nThe only opposition to the resolution\nwas that of the five Georgia\nrepresentatives who several davs nen\nannounced their plan to have the\ncaucus agree to a resolution which\nwould not hind the Democrats to\nsupport the insurgents in their fight\non the rules unless the latter agreed\nto vote against Mr. Cannon for speaker,\nto favor unlimited debate under\nthe five-minute rule and to seek a\ncomplete revision of the rules of\nthe House.\nThis amendment was ofTered by\nMr. Livingston of Georgia, but was\noverwhelmingly defeated. Representatives\nEdwards (Ga) then en- i\ndeavored to offer a resolution to bind\nthe members of the caucus to its\naction, but he was not recognized by\nthe chairman.
