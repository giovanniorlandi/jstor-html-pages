They are reported to have\ncaptured two important forts.\nGeneral Kuropatkin reports to St.\nPetersburg that the Japanese position\nat Bentsiaputze is strongly held by a\nJapanese brigade with guns and that\nlarge Japanese forces from Liaoyang\nhave already crossed to the right bank\nof the Taitse river.\nBATTLE RAGED ENTIRE DAY\nJAPANESE FORCES MAKE A GEN-\nERAL ASSAULT UPON\nPORT ARTHUR.\nChefoo, Sept.. 21.Authoritative in\nformation has been received here of a\ngeneral attack upon Port Arthur by\nthe Japanese forces which began Mon\nday before daybreak and continued\nuntil dark.\nAll indications point to an effort to\ncapture certain northeast maiu forts.\nShanghai, Sept. 21.The general at\ntack on Port Arthur which began Mon\nday and in which the Japanese fleet is\nco-operating, was resumed Tuesday\nmorning. The Japanese captured two\nimportant forts on the east side of\nSueuzeying, north of Port Arthur.\nThe general assault on Port Arthur\nis the attack lor which the Japanese\nhave been preparing ior the past nine\nteen days, with slight hope of success.\nAs forecasted in these dispatches the\nJapanese attack on Port Arthur is di\nrected against the northeast front.\nThe main object, is to capture the for\ntifications of Kikwan mountain, Rih\nlung mountain and the intermediate\nforts. The foregoing comes from a\nRussian of standing, whose previous\ninformation has been correct. He adds\nthat #the attack at the end of August,\n"Which was represented as two separate\nassaults, really constituted a ten days\'\nbattle, the fighting being the heaviest\nduring the lirst three days and\nthesmall\nlast four days of that period.\nThe Japanese have been taught\n,1\nwholesome respect" for the resisting\npowers of the fortress, according to\nevery Japanese who has recently ar\nrived from Port Dalny. If they suc\nceed in capturing Rihling mountain or\nother forts they will realize that this\nwill be only one step, although an im\nportant one, towards the capture of\nPort Arthur. The Russians, who have\nbeen observing the new tactics of the\nJapanese, did not expect another at\ntack before the first week in October.\nThe Japanese are endeavoring to pro\nceed slowly but surely.\nORDERED TO TH E FRONT.\ni Russian Officers at St. Petersburg to\nGo to Scene of War.\nI St. Petersburg, Sept. 21.There is a\nstory atloat that a sudden call has been\nissued to officers of the guard regi\nments stationed at St. Petersburg to\nreport for service at the front. Ac\ncording to report the order directs that\neight of a total of fifty-six officers of\neach regiment should be chosen by lot\nand drafted to serve with regiments\nnow in the far East. It is stated that\nthe order has aroused great discontent.\nWhole regiments are anxious to go to\nthe theater of war, but the officials in\ntensely dislike the prospect of the or\nganizations being split up. It is im\npossible at this time to obtain any au\nthoritative confirmation or denial of\nthe report.\nCAPTURED MUCH SUPPLIES.\nAdditional List of Stoies Taken by\nJaps at Liaoyang.\nTokio, Sept. 21.Piekl Marshal\nOyama, commanding the Japanese\nforces in Manchuria, has telegraphed\nas follows:\n"An investigation of the trophies\ncaptured by us, made since our last\nreport, shows the number of Russian\nbuildings occupied by us in the neigh\nborhood of .Liaoyang station to be 353\ni houses and 214 warehouses, covering\nan area of 58,000 square yards. We\nalso seized 79,360 bushels of barley,\nrice, wheat and millet 1,300 cases of\nkerosene, 1.S00 cases of sugar, It 6\ntons of coal and much cordwood. The\namount of coal captured by General\nKuroki will be reported later."\nJAPS CROSS TH E TAITSE RIVER.\nKuropatkin Reports Result of Recon\nnaissance.\nSt. Petersburg, Sept. 21.The fol\nlowing dispatch has been received\nfrom General Kuropatkin:\n"The reconnaissance made Sept. 17\nestablished the fact that the JapancHv\nposition at Bentsiaputze is strongiy\nheld by a brigade with guns. The:\nwas no enemy east of Bentsiapulx.\\\nbut Japanese reinforcements arrive 1\nSept. 18 in the vicinity of that village.\nLarge Japanese forces from Liaoyang\nhave already crossed to the right bank\nOf the Taitse river.\n"A Cossack patrol attacked a Jap\nanese convoy west of Bentsiaputze\nand captured thirty horses, with their\nloads."\nRussian Warship at Mare Island Ren\ndered Harmless.\nVallejo, Cal., Sept. 21.The dis\narmament of the Russian transport\nLena has been completed at. Mare\nIsland navyyard. Her ammunition\nwill also be removed. It is prob\nable that the Lena will go to a private\nshipyard for repairs to her boilers. A\nnumber of her crew will remain\non board of her as a guard.\nthis opportunity to inspect the best displayed stock in Northern Minnesota.\nvv:,1 ^^:J?^SI\'\n$!99$lf$d$$$9$0(l9$999(99999\nFALL\nMillin ening\n15he Berman Emporium\nNext Door to Post Office.\n&$ &\n-M"&\nS^?^^?*\'S\nPERMISSION TO MARRY\nGENERAL CORBIN WOULD HAVE\nSECRETARY OF WAR PASS ON\nFITNESS OF OFFICERS.\nSAYS OUR ARMY IS 0VERMARR1ED\nAPPLICANT SHOULD BE FREE OF\nDEBTS AND PROVE ABILITY\nTO SUPPORT FAMILY.\nWashington, Sept. 21.That no\narmy officer be permitted to marry\nuntil he has secured the permission\nof the secretary of war and satisfied\nthat officer that his income is sufficient\nto support himself and family and that\nhe is entirely free from debt is the\nrecommendation by Major General\nHenry C. Corbin, adjutant general,\ncommanding the Atlantic division and\ndepartment of the East, which was\nissued at the war department during\nthe day. Regarding marriage in the\narmy General Corbin says:\n"I desire to reiterate in effect what\nI have formerly said on this subject,\nwhich statement, however, has been\nmisread, misquoted and misunder\nstood.\n"Marriage of army officers who have\nmade no proper provision for assum\ning the responsibilities therefor is\nhurtful both to the army and to the\nofficers themselves. To this broad\nstatement there are, of course, excep\ntions, as there are to all broad state\nments, but the general fact remains\nthat our army is overmarried. The\npay of a subaltern officer is barely\nenough for his proper support and the\nexpenses of his equipment and uni\nform. If to this is added the inevitable\nexpenses attached to a family it is not\nonly probable but almost certain that\nwhen an officer strikes his balance of\nthe year he will be behind if he has\nno income but his pay.\n"That a bachelor officer is more val\nuable to the service than a married\nofficer does not follow, nor do I wish\nto be understood as so saying, but the\nmarried officer is less valuable if, in\nmarrying, he has not exercised that\nprudence which should govern all\ntransactions in life."\nFurther on in his report General Cor\nbin says:\n"I am firmly of -the opinion that no\nofficer should approach the marriage\nrelation without first getting the auwere\nthority of the war department and as\na necessary condition thereto that his\nincome after marriage will be suffi\ncient to support himself and family\nand, above all, if he is to live on his\npay, he should state on honor that he\nis free from debt."\nFOR PROTECTION OF INDIANS.\nProceeds of Land Sales to Be Depos\nited in Banks.\nWashington, Sept. 21.One of the\nmost drastic orders ever issued by the\ngovernment for the protection of. the\nat the only Exclusive Dry Goods House in Bemidji\n..THE BERMAN EMPORIUM..\nLargest display of\nFrench Pattern, Tailor-Made and Street Hats\nEvery brought to the city.\nFriday and Saturday, September 23 & 24\nwe will, also show the most extensive line of new attractions in\nFall Suits, Tourist Coats, Ladies\' and Children\'s\nCloaks and Jackets in all the newest makes.\nOur famous line of Waists and Skirts in all the newest makes and materials\nsurpasses everything heretofore shown in style and price.

BEMIDJI, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1904.\nTEN CENTS PER WEEK\nseveral Indian tribes against fraud\nand robbery was promulgated during\nthe day by Acting Secretary of the In\nterior Ryan. The order in question\namends the rules for the sale of in\nherited Indian lands so as to require\nthat the proceeds derived from their\nsale shall be placed with the most\nconvenient United States depository\ntathe credit of each heir in proper\nproportion, subject to the check of\nsuch heirs or tfceir recognized guar\ndians for amounts not exceeding $10\nto each in any one month. Before be^\ning paid, however, it will be necessary\nfor these checks to be approved by the\nagent or other officer in charge. For\nsums in excess of $10 per month the\nmoney will be paid upon the approval\nof the agent only when specifically\nauthorized so to do by the commis\nsioner of Indian affairs.\nActing Secretary Ryan said that\nheretofore the lands have been sold\nto the highest bidder and the proceeds\npaid directly to the Indians, with the\nresult that in many instances the In\ndians were soon dive\'sted of their\nmoney.\nWOMAN SECURES $20,000.\nEnd of Sensational Breach of Promise\nSuit at Duluth.\nDuluth, Sept. 21.After being out\nless than one hour the jury in the\nbreach of promise suit brought by\nSarah B. Ham of Dubuque, la., against\nG. A. Potter, a wealthy Wisconsin lum\nber merchant, brought in a verdict\nawarding $20,000 to the plaintiff.\nThe trial consumed one week and\nthe testimony was the most sensa\ntional ever heard in a Minnesota court.\nThe defendant was accused of drag\nging Miss Ham to accomplish her ruin\nand his love letter*, extending over a\nperiod of twenty-nine years were read\nin court to establish her contention\nthat he intended to marry her.\nHis defense was made in an effort\nto establish that she was a woman of\nimmoral character. Miss Ham is forty\nnine years old and Potter is sixty-two.\nIt is expected that the case will be\nappealed.\nMasons Meet at Boston.\nBoston, Sept. 21.Masons from all\nof the Northern states who have at\ntained the highest rankthe thirty\nthird degreegathered at Masonic\nTemple during the day for the ninety\nsecond annual meeting of the supreme\ncouncil, Ancient Accepted Scottish\nRite, for the Northern Masonic juris\ndiction of the United States of Amer\nica.

It is too\nsoon to say what the events of\nthe past few weeks have taught\nus as to the law. This much is\ncertainthere is more dissatis\nfaction with the law, that is,\nmore dissatisfaction of a serious\nnature, than there was two years\nago. Then the outcry was\nthat the law pryed into a\nman\'s private affairs in compell\ning him to declare his political\naffiliations. Today the law is\ncomplained of because of the\nheavy bill of expense it causes\nthe candidate, because it is break\ning down all political lines, be\ncause it affords even greater op\nportunities for political combina\ntions to defeat the popular will\nthan did tne convention system.\nWhether these complaints are\njustified by the operation of the"\nlaw, we shall be in a better posi\ntion to judge when we are further\nremoved from this, the second\ntest.\nOne thing which will have\nmuch to do with the fate*of the\nlaw, will be the vote cast yester\nday throughout Minnesota. A\nheavy vote will argue in favor of\nthe law, while a light vote, will\nbe taken to mean indifference\non the part of the people, and\nthe law will be greatly endang\nered.\nA Clean Canvass.\nBeltrami county is to be con\ngratulated upon the fact that,\nwhile the campaign of the past\nfew weeks has been an earnest\none, actively prosecuted by the\nvarious candidates, there has\nbeen little of "mud slinging."\nThe primary law involves a most\nstrenuous personal contest be\ntween candidates and it is a trib\nute to the worth of the candi\ndates that there has been so\nmuch good humor, so little re\ncrimination and so few personal\nattacks. Even where ample am\nmunition was to be had it has\nbeen withheld and the candi\ndates have been content to pre\nsent their qualifications rather\ntheir disqualifications. This has\nnot been universally true but it\nhas been generally so and there\nis as a result far less bitterness\ntoday than might be expected.\nWith hardly an exception the\nwinners are entitled to their win\nnings and the defeated have\nmade a good fight.\nTHE coroner of St. Louis\ncounty warns hunters in that\ncounty that killing men by acci\ndent will not be lightly excused\nthis year but that indictments\nfor manslaughter will threaten\nevery case.

He was making his way to\nSagamore Hill when he was arrested.\nHe told Officer Tyiee, who apprehend\ned him, that he wanted to see the\npresident on important business. Be\nlieving from the manner of rhe man\nthat he was insane Officer Tyree took\nhim before Justice Franklin for exam\nination To the juotice Reeves said\nthat six years ago he died in a Jersey\nCity hospital and went to heaven in\nan automobile. While there he re\nceived an important message for Pres\nident Roosevelt, which he was direct\ned to deliver personally. He also de\nclared that he had written a book on\nhis experiences in heaven which he de\nsired to have published, as he was sat\nisfied that millions could be made out\nof it. The president, he said, undoubt\nedly would join with him in securing\nthe publication of the work and that\nwas one reason why he wished to have\na talk with him. He had in his poc\nkets $2- cash and some unimportant\npapers, but no weapons.

Instead of so doing Russia\nclaims that a treaty was foiced upon\nthe Tibetans which goes much fmther,\ncreating a \\ntual protectoiate over\nthe country. Moreover it is contend\ned that the tieaty is a lestriction upon\nthe sovereignty of China, inasmuch as\nwhile lecogmzmg the sovereignty of\nChina by requiring her latification the\ntreaty once ratified transteis the sov\nereignty to Gieat Butain by compel\nling Tibet\nTo Consult Great Britain\nin its dealings with the other poweis.\nThis is considered to be aimed direct\nly at Russia The protest lodged\nLondon doubtless will be followed up\nby one at Peking against the iaifica\ntion ot the treaty.\nGreat Britain is believed heie to jus\ntify her action on the ground that sue\nonly agreed to confine herbeli to cei\ntain specified limits contained the\nassurances given to Russia it the\nTibetans did not oppose the Bntish\nexpedition. As a matter ot tact little\nhope is entertained in official circles\nhere that the Russian protests will be\nheeded either by Great Britain oi\nChina, as Russia is not in a position\nto make an issue. The general feel\ning is that Great Britain has profited\nby Russia\'s preoccupation in the wai\nto make her position in Tibet secure.\nTherefoie the chief impoitance ot the\npiotest at this time seives notice that\nRussia does not acquiesce in Great\nBntam\'s Tibetan programme and that\nShe will feel herself at liberty to re\nopen the question when her hands aie\nagain free.\nRUSSIAN PRESS IRRITATED.\nBitterly Comments on British Treaty\nWith Tibet.\nSt. Petersbuig, Sept. 21.With the\narrival here of the full text of the\nBntish tieaty with Tibet the irritation\nof the Russian press at its sweeping\ncharacter is more pronounced. The\nRuss, which is now consideied to espe\ncially reflect the views of the foreign\noffice, bitterly complains that Great\nBritain has gone beyond her promises\nconcerning the expedition by acquiring\na virtual protectorate over Tibet,\nwhereas she had pledged herself to\nmerely regulate trade relations be\ntween India and Tibet Instead, the\npaper declares, Great Britain has im\nposed upon Tibet onerous terms whieh\ngive her a monopoly, forbidding Tibet,\nwithout Great Bntam\'s consent, to en\nter into lelations with -the outside\nworld The Russ foresees that the oc\ncupation of the Chumbi valley by the\nBritish will be prolonged even after\nthe payment of the indemnity\nRUSSIAN PROTEST EXPECTED.\nObjection to Portion of British-Tibetan\nTreaty Likely.\nLondon, Sept. 21 Nu notification\nby Russia of her refusal to recognize\nthe validity of the Anglo Tibetan\ntreaty has yet reached the foieign\noffice, though it is well undei stood in\ndiplomatic circles that the St Peteis\nburg authorities object to aiticle 9,\nwhich gives Great Britain piactical\nsuzeiamty over the affans ot the Chi\nnese piovince, and to the provision\nthat the British occupation of the\nChumbi valley shall continue in case\nthe indemnity is not paid The foreign\noffice here evidently does not appre\nhend an objection from any other\npower and leiterates that the assur\nances given the United States that\nthere will be no permanent occupa\ntion of any portion of Tibetan territory\nwill be observed.\nPASSENGER TRAIN WRECKED.\nThirty-two Persons Injured, Six of\nThem Seriously,\nJunction City, Kan, Sept, 21.The\nPullman section of the eastbound At\nlantic express on the Union Pacific\nwas wrecked six miles west of heie\nshortly after 1 p. by rails spiead\nIng.
