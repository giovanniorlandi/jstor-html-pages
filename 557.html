to\nw\nGr\nHow the British Army Communicato\nla South Africa\nThe regularity with which mes\nsages havo been received from bo\nsiegfd Ladysmith Mafokiug and\nKimborley has demonstrated the\nsuccess of mbdern methods of war\nsignaling and tho practical applica\ntion of these systems of signaling\nsounds the death knell of tho old\ntime horseback couriers acd spies\nWithout depending upon tho per\nsonal exertions of a Biugle horseback\nrider the British gonorals have\nestablished communications when\nwithin fifty or sixty miles of each\nother Tho Marconi system of wim\nIoes telegraphy has bpen utilized to\nsome extent and messages have been\nsuccessfully sent through the Boer\nlines to Ladysmith But so far tho\nwar balloons and eloctric signalling\napparatus hava proved of much\ngreater value to tho English army\nThe war balloon has been hover\ning over Ladysmith for weeks and\nfrom tho extreme altitude attained\nby it tho signal officers have been\nable to communicato with General\nBulleis army across the Tugela\nRiver This is accomplished by\nmeans of electric rays which are\nlashed by night on the clouds the\nBArre as a Bearch light from a war\nship An electric cable connentB tho\nsignal apparatus in the balloon to\nnn electric generator on the ground\nbelow By employing a system of\ndots aqddashes similar to the Morse\ntelegraphic code messages can be\nwritten on the clouds tliat none but\najriend can understand them\nAs tho code of signals is known\nonly to tho English Bignal offacerc\nthe messages are rent- right across\nthe Boer lines without running any\nrisk of being interpreted Tltis is\neven an improvement ou the old\nwar telegraphing for the linos of\nwires employed for sending the\ndespatches could be tapped at any\npoint by an expert and tho messages\nrad off tin lac a a continuous guard\nalong the whole lino was established\nto watch it Many of the old time\nwar messages wero of course seat in\ncipher by theold Unld telegraphers\nbut in many instances important\nmessages were sent in a hurry with\nout employing cipher and thoy\nleaked out so the enemy profited by\nthem\nThe war balloon in South Africa\nhas thus rendered signal service in\ntwo ways It has enabled the signal\nservice men to establish communica\ntions with different parts of the\narmy at all timor and to keep the\nbeleaguered garrison at Ladysnith\nfully apprizod of all that was boing\ndjim for its- relief As an advan\ntageous r oit of observation the\nballoon has been almost invaluable\nIt has repeatedly discovered tho\nsecret preparations of the Boor\nand directed tho artillery firo of the\nBritiib The splendid work of tho\nnaval guns is due to the war balloon\nTheir long range would have been\nineffective without tho help of the\nobservers in the balloons who from\ntheir enormous altitude were en\nabled to see exactly what damage\nthe Bbolls woro doing and when they\nfell short of the mark\nThe other method of signalling in\nSouth Africa which has been em\nployed by both Boer and 33rititliu is\nwith the heliograph an instrument\nthat the Boers described as a shaving-glass\non a tripod Tuoro seems\nto be little else to the instrument\nbut in range effectiveness and port\nability no modern invention equals\nit Thoholio as it is called in\narmy parlance can be carried almost\nas easily as an ordinary army rifle\nand it can be easily set up aud ad\njusted quiokly as a hand camera\nThe range of tho helio is enor\nmous in countries where the atmos\nphere is clear aud the tun strong\nThes two conditions prevail in South\nAfrica to a remarkable degree and\nin consequence thn sneess of the\nlittle instrument has been great from\nthe first\nThis was known to tho British be\nfore tho present army was despatch\ned there and Ladysmith and the\nother towns had plenty of the ap\nparatuses for ubo When tho Eng\nlith army campaigned there in 1883\n5 the holicgraphio hi rvico urs\nfrom tho Orange Iliver to\nMolopole a distance of -129 miles\nThere wero twenty nine stations be\ntween these two pointf the distance\nbotwren two of which was forty two\nmiles Notwithstanding this griat\nuumhor of stations messages were\ndelivered over the whole length of\nthe lino within half an hour after\nthey wero first received At one\ntime fifty two words were signalled\nin this way 110 miles within thirty\nDvj minutes after the first operator\nreceived them Tho highest record\nreached in thai campaign was tho\ntransmission in a single day of 8013\nwords\nTho helio simply follows the\nsun and reflects its rays on a distant\nstation where it can ba read by\nthose in charge while an enemy sta\ntion only a few rods off can see no\nBign of the signalling rays This in\nvisibility of the rajs to all except\nthose right by the receiving Etaliou\nis one of the excellent points in favor\nof tho helio There is a little\nmochanism to give the proper verti\ncal and horizontal movement to the\nglass so that it can follow the sun\nthroughout its course and then a\nkey fitted to the back of the mirror\nproduces the dot and dash Hashes\non the distant point\nIn Egypt the helio partly failed\nbecause of climatic conditions One\nof these was the peculiarity of the\nmirage which interfered continually\nwith tho ray and another was that\nthe country was so flat it was diffi\ncult to find stations high enough to\nsend and receivo the mosaajjes\nNevertheless when Candahar was\nbesieged and out off from tho rest of\nthe world in 1880 it was the helio\ngraph which first aunounced to the\ngarrison the approach of the reev\ning column forty eight miles distant\nWhen the helio announced the\nwelcome uows the garrison was worn\nout and discouraged aud the offi\ncers were nearly overcome by tho\nwelcome message flashed out of tho\nhazy atmosphere Tho message was\nreceivca turougn an atmospnere so\nhazy that telescopes were unable to\npierce lHarpern

expected several protests in\nregard to the locating of licensed\nwomen at Palama We felt suro\nthat the residents and property own\nera of Kalihi and Palama would feel\nindignant when they learned that\nthe Government has decided that no\nsaloon licenses will be granted aud\nno licensed women allowed to ply\ntheir business on Fort street or in\nany place on the Waikiki side of\nthat thoroughfare\nThe ruling indicates that the peo\nple living on the Waikiki tide of\nFort street are of a superior quality\nto those living on the Ewa side\nNo man with a pull evidently lives\nat Palama and for that reasons sa\nloons and brothels can be placed\nthere because there are presumably\nno families to be annoyed no chil\ndren to be corrupted Is it possible\nthat Minister Young discriminates\nagainst the people on the Ewa Bide\nof Fort street because he has no\nresidences there and because be\nfeels morally obliged to protect\nthe millionaires at Waikiki\nWe have received

alternative no suggestions\nhe simply shouts keep them away\nfrom my lambs Mr Eckardt is\ntoo practical a man more especially\nthrough his hospital experience not\nto realize that the social evil is a\nnecessary ovil and yet ho Eolfishly\ncries out against a solution of tho\nserious question because bis boys\nmay bo tempted while at school\nFortunately the Marshal has com\nmon practical sense nnd while we\nthink he could have devised methods\nin dealing with the unfortunate wo\nmen which did not savor too mueh\nof a persecution ho has taken steps\nwhich will regulate the evil as far as\nit is possible to do so and he de\nserves the thanks of tho community\nfor doing so We think that the\nvirtuo of the St Louis boys will not\nbe impaired it would bo a hard job\nto do so and we cannot help
