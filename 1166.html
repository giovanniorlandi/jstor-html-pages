President Garfield of Williams Colege, who was at the\nhead of the board which to fixed the price of wheat and of\nbread, will pretend, we assume, to no special knowledge of the sub.\nject with which he will deal. He has spent his life as a none-too-successful\nlawyer in Ohio, as a professor for a brief time at Prince,\nton, and as president of Williams, whence he his brothers and his din-\ntinguished father were all graduated. His political affiliations have\nbeen just as numerous as his professional callings, ne was first a\nRepublican, then a Progressive, and last year a supporter of Wilson.\nHe has been selected for his present task witli the same unerring\nsense which enabled the President\nCommissioner, Bainbridge Colby\n. Victor Murdock for a Trade Commissioner. This is an era of non-partisanship\nin which emphasis is placed upon the kind of non-partisan\nship evidenced by men who were\nvoted for Woodrow Wilson.\nA SOUND\nSenator Weeks was entirely sound in his plea to the President\nin behalf of the exemption of married men with dependent families\nwhere the marriage was not contracted for the purpose of securing\nexemption. Economically, nothing is gained by sending to the front\na man upon whose labor a family is dependent. It takes the full\ntime labor of a man to provide for a dependent family and if the\nnatural and legal provider be taken away, some other person\'s labor\nmust supply the support. If the support be provided by government\nappropriation, some one must labor to pay the taxes\'imposed. From\nevery viewpoint humanity, economics, patriotism men who are of\n. military age and have no dependcntashould lie first called to the col\nors. ,-When that list has been exhausted, it will be time to call upon\nmen with dependent families. Senator Weeks rendered commendable\nservice when he induced the President to give instructions that the\npolicy sugested by him be adopted.\nThe Republican policy of protection to American industries and\nthe American standard of wages is our best assurance of prosperity\nto continue when the war is no more.

Getting\nAhead in the Army.)\nYou are careful to observe the or\ndinary courtesies In your civilian life.\nYou would soon make yourself of\nfensive to all your friends If you were\nIn the habit of passing them with a\ncold stare or a discourteous nod.\nThese customary rules of good\nbreeding apply In a slightly different\nform In the Army. There is the same\nreason for them in the Army as in\ncivil life. Courtesy helps to make the\ngreat Army machine run more\nsmoothly. It is the outward sign that\nthe right relations exist among of\nfleers and men.\nThese right relations should be\ngiven expression both within the mili\ntary camp and outside. "Courtesy\namong military men is Indispensable\nto discipline; respect to superiors will\nnot be confined to obedience on duty,\nbut will be extended on all occasions,"\n(Army Regulations, par. 4- The obll\nKatlon to show nroper courtesy is\nbinding upon officers as well as upon\nmen. The commanding general of the\nArmy is required to be courteous to\nyou, Just as you are required to be\ncourteous to him.\nImportance of Correct Forms\nCourtesy among military men is\nshown by speaking and acting ia a re\nspectful manner. It is shown also by\nusing the correct form of recognition.\nThis correct form when meeting or\naddressing commissioned officers is\nknown as the military salute.\n"In the old days the free men of Eu\nrope were all allowed to carry weap\nons, and when they met each would\nhold up his right hand to show that he\nhad no weapon in it and that they met\nas friends., Slaves or serfs, however,\nwere not allowed to carry weapons,\nand slunk past the free men without\nmaking any sign. In this way the\nsalute came to be the symbol or sign\nby which soldiers (free men) might\nrecognize each other. The lower\nclasses began to imitate the soldiers\nin this respect, although In a clumsy,\napologetic way, and thence crept in\nto civil life the custom of raising the\nhand or nodding as one passed an ac\nqualntance. The soldiers, however,\nkept their individual salute, and pur\nposely made it intricate and difficult\nto learn In order that It could be ac\nquired only by the constant training\nof all real soldiers received.\n"To this day armies bave preserved\ntheir salute, and when correctly done\nit is at once recognized and never\nmistaken for that of the civilian. AH\nsoldiers should be careful to execute\nthe salute exactly as prescribed. The\ncivilian or the imitation soldier who\ntries to imitate the military salute in\nvariably makes real soldier; he gives\nit In an apologetic manner, he fails to\nstand or march at attention, his coat\nis unbuttoned or hat on awry, or he\nfails to look the person saluted In the\neye. There is a wide difference in the\nmethod of rendering and meaning be\ntween the civilian salute as used by\nfriends in passing, or by servants to\nthsir employers, and the military\nsalute, the symbol and sign of the\nmilitary profession." (Manual for\nNoncommissioned Officers and Pri\nvates, sec. 6.)\nProper Way U Salute\nIn order to give the salute properly\nwhen you are without arms, first as\nsume the position of a soldier (as de\nscribed in a preceding lesson), or If\nyou are walking carry yourself at at\ntention. Look the offleer you are to\nsalute straight In the eye. When he\nis a few paces away from you "raise\nthe right hand smartly till the tip of\nthe forefinger touches the lower part\nof the head dress or forehad above the\nright eye, thumb and fingers extend\ned and Joined, palm to the left fore\narm Inclined at about 46\', hand and\nwrist straight Continue to look the\noffioer you are saluting straight In\nthe eye and keep your band In the\nposition of salute until the officer ac\nknowledges the salute or until he has\npassed. Then drop the hand smsrtly\nto the side. Ths salute Is given with\nthe right hand only." (Manual for\nNoncommissioned Officers and Pri\nvates, see. I.) It will be well for you\nto practice this movement before the\nFin citizeii-soldi&s\nlooking-glass and be prepared to exe\ncute it properly as soon as you get\ninto uniform. It Is one of the things\nthat will help to mark you In the\nearly days in camp as psssessing the\nbearing sf a good soldier. When yoa\nget an opportunity, watch closely to\nsee how. Regular Army men salute.\nNote that your hat should be on\nstraight coat-completely buttoned up,\nand hands out of the pockets.\nYou will learn the rifle salute after\nyou have reached the training camp.\nIn general it is used whenver you are\ncarrying a rifle, except when on guard\nduty, in which case you ordinarily\npresent arms Instead of saluting .\nThe exact conditions under which\nthe salutes are given need not be re\npeated in detail here. It is enough for\nthe present to learn you are to salute\nall commissioned officers (not merely\nthose of your own company or regi\nment or those with whom you are ac\nquainted), except when you are in\nmilitary formation or when you are\nat drill, work, games, or mess. When\nIn formation, you do not salute or\ncome to the position of attention un\nless an officer speaks to you.\nOther Army Courtesies\nNever forget that it is not only re\nquired of you as a duty, but is also\nyour right and privilege, to salute all\ncommissioned officers and to have\nyour courtesy returned. This state\nment assumes, of course, that you are\nin good standing as a soldier. A mill\ntary prisoner Is not permitted to sa\nlute.\nIt is the custom of the Army in\nspeaking to an officer to stand at at\ntention and use the word "sir." In all\nofficial conversation refer to other\nsoldiers by their titles for example,\n"Sergeant Smith" or "Private Brown,"\nnot merelly "Smith" or "Brown."\n"When an officer enters a room\nwhere there are several enlisted met,\nthe word \'attention\' is given by some\none who perceive him, when all rise,\nuncover, and remain standing at at\ntention until the officer leaves the\nroom or directs otherwise. Enlisted\nmen at meals stop eating and remain\nseated at attention." (Iufantry Drill\nRegulations, par. 759.)\nSalutes are not exchanged amdng\nnoncommissioned otilsers and enlist\ned men. However, this does not mean\nthat you are not to treat them with\nrespect and eourtesy.\nFor Mayor\nThe Ledger is authorized to an\nnounce Harry C.
