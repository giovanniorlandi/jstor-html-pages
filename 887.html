This would\nmean that quotations would have to\nre made on three basic grades instead\nof on middling, the basic grade\nan which all prices now are founded.\nIf he should fail in t\'lrs effort,\nSenator Dial says that he will ask\nhat Section 5 of the present law,\n^ernrtting the seller to make delivery\n:n any one of the tenderable\nTrades, be eliminated entirely and\n.vithout a substitute, which would\nnave tne enect 01 iorcmg an saies\n"Ti the basis of Section 10, which\nprovides that a specific grade be\nmentioned in the contract, and that\nioijvery must be in that identical\n?rado.\nS\'nce enactment of the present\notton contract law in 1914, Senator\n~>ial states ihat not a single sale has\n,%een made on the New York Cotton\n^change under Section 10, but that\n" 11 sales have been under Section 5.\nCoca-Cola Dividend\nAtlanta, Ga., Nov. 28.?Direcors\nof the Coca-Cola Company at\nheir quarterly meeting here today\neclared a dividend of $1.50 on\noromon stock, payable January 2\no stockholders of record December\n!5.

Football\nis becoming too much of a dominant\nfactor in the standing of the colleges,\nand tnat much less is being thought\nof the real standing of these colleges\nas institutions of learning.\nThere is much to be said in favor\nof football as an amusement and\nas a developer of college boys and\nmen. It is a manly sport. But it has\nbecome more than a sport. No longer\nthe colleges encourage football\nfor the purpose of developing the\nstudents physically and otherwise.\nThe game is now resorted to as a\nmeans of advertising the college. The\nfootball team represents the standing\nof the college in the public\nmind. Everything else is forgotten.\nAnd in order that the college may\nbe properly represented by its foot\nball team, the team must be trained.\nThere must be coaches and assistant\noaches. These men receive in many\ncases several times the salary paid\nto the president of the college and to\nthe professor who has given a lifetime\nof hard work in an endeavor to\nmake the institution a real institution\nof learning. The alumni and\nfriends of the college are willing\neach season to raise $15,000 to $25,000,\nif needs be, for the proper\ntraining of the football team. But\nif the college sent out a call for\nfunds -with the announcement that\nthe income from the endowment was\ninsufficient to pay expenses and that\nthe salaries of the Drofessors were\nso meagre they could not live, there\nwould be little if any response to\nthe call.\nAnd we cannot see that the men\nwho play football on the football\nteams after they go away are bringing\nany more credit to the colleges\nthan ordinary individuals who have\nnever played football. Do they make\nbetter fanners, better lawyers, better\npreachers, or more learned\nstatesmen than the men who study\nbooks and do not play football? We\nhardly think so.\nThen too there is another danger.\nThe game is not played by professionals,\nit is stated. It is not and then\nit is. There are men in the colleges\nplaying football today who would\nnot be there if football was not beTi7k+1\n~\nnig n uxzu uiere 13 a uuarwy\nhigh school boy who has made a record\non the high school team as a\nfirst class player, some alumnus of\nsome college suddenly desires to give\nh\'m an education at this or the other\ninstitut\'on. He goes to a college\nwhere a strong team is being built\nun, and maybe not to the college he\nwould select, if he sought only an\neducation. The student body now and\nthen decides that some student who\nhas been at college, but who is kept\naway for financial reasons, should\ncome back and complete his education.\nBut he stars at football and\nnot in the class-room. The boy of\ngreat promise in the class-room is\nse\'dom remembered.\nWe say that the warning of President\nR\'ggs is timely and must be\nheeded. Either football must go or\nthere must be rules promulgated and\nenforced which will keep the game\nwhpre it belongs.\nAn^ ffce trouble is not alone with\n"01<?<Tes. The hi^h schools are\nwell tra\'ned teams am-rcct\nthe students who attend\nthese ^ch^gta. Last week there was\na Tnoo^YTr of high school men at Anwas\n>,v t^e nr0per\na"th^r\'t;P9 that one high school in\nc+nfo hsd a man on i+s tpam who\nw - \'-"\'\'"-\'hie. The snnerintendent\n0\' an in another citv and th?\nn?o~??"f the team in another cifv\np? \' ? d *he evidence a^d filed the\nf ?on wh:ch the high school\njj. ..i - ?\'n,i Tf these n^3C\',?- an-1\ntion why could not the superintendent\nof the school attended by this\nstudent obtain the same information?\nHe could perhaps if he had investigated\nas he should. There are\ncharges of irregularities in other high\nschools. At the same meeting serious\nquestion was made as to the |\neligibility of players on other teams, j\nThe evidence adduced and the\ncharges made, before and ^fter lead,\njis to believe that the high school authorities,\nare either unable to keep\ntrack of the situation, or are willing\n{to stretch the rules until they are\n: vu ugn w..\nWe do not believe that the modern\nfootball coach is a proper man\nto have charge of a large collection\nof college or high school boys. In Abbeville\nwe have a fine high school\njteam, and a good coach, a young\n1 man of the highest character and\n^standing. There is no complaint\n;(made against him. We think he has\ndone much for the boys of our high\nschool. But the good he has done f^r\n\' the boys in this high schoo\' has been\nfndone by other coaches for other\ni\'high schools. Only a little while ago\nthere was a football team from another\nhigh school here in charge of\nits coach. The coach (a hired coach\n1 we believe) had thought, as did his\nteam, that the game would be won\nwithout difficulty. When it was not\nthe conduct and conversation of the\ncoach would have seemed entirely\nrepreshensible by the average present.\nPerhaps his understudies\nthought as much of him as a leader\nas do the Abbeville boys of their\ncoach. If so, it may easily be seen\nthat much harm may come from\ntheir association. Other reasons than\nthis one suggest that football plavjers,\non the college teams and on the\n:high school teams, do not always\ncome in contact with the proper injfluences.\nGOVERNOR ENDORSES\nTUBERCULOSIS ASSOCIATION\nGovernor-Elect Thomas G. Mc,\nLeod highly endorses the work bun?\ndone by the South Carolina Tuber,\nculosis Association to elim\'nate tu\nberculosis from South Carolina. In\na recent letter received by th:s organization\nfrom the governor-elect,\n]he says:\n"I take pleasure in expressing my\nvery deep interest in the work of\nthe South Carolina Tuberculosis As\nsociation.
