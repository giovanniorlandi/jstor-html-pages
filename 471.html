There i* not a, man named who is not one of wide ex, perience anil the highest interity., Every nominee is a pioneer of Skag, it ay and every one is very strongly in, terested in good government for the, town. Nearly all of them have been, tried in public positions of responsibil, ity always to make good. It is a tickst, that deserves success., The Daily Alaskan will not contend,, of course, that all the good material, before the people is on the Citizens\', ticket. It is not. The Labor party, ticket contains the names of some good, men? men who have served aolv to the, credit of the city and to their own, honor on the council and who are not in, sympathy with the reckless charges,, concerning city affairs, that are being, bandied back and forth on the street by, people who speak without knowledge., it is not out of the way to add that, most of these candidates were present, and participated on the caucus which, arranges the tcket for the Citizens\', convention., TH? DAILY ALASKAN IN THE, CAMPAIGN, The Daily Alaskan believes in aj, vij&re deal and * (air hearing, and,:, recognizing \'.he fact that it is the onlyj, newspaper published in this city, it i, takes thU opportunity to renew the, offer it made :n the campaign of a year, ngo: It will give the free use of Its, columns to those interested in the com, ing election It will only ask that, printable matter be offered and that it, r.ot be libelous. It will uive as much, .-pace to those who support one party as, it will to the other side., This invitation is directed particular, ly to the candidates, members of the, central committees and leaders of the, so-called municipal parties., W?* must insist, of course, tb\'. ali, letters offered for publication be signed., < ommunications should be written, on one side of the paper, only, and thoy, should be in the hands of the printers, at the earliest possible hour on the day, of publication., Mayor Shaw, who was nominated last, night by the Citizen\'s convention, Is, again a candidate for the suffrages of, the people of Skagway against his in, clinations. He did not desire to run, again, and he only consented to the, ??;se of bis name when it was put up to, him as a public duty by numerous bus, iness men men of this city who recog, nized the peculiar need to have men on, the new council who are familiar with, the la-.vs governing municipalities, the, city\'s ordinances and the affair* of the, city in general. Ihat this is a real, need is so plainly evided that it does, not require emphasis., It is all the more important now be, cause cf the fact that the city is getting, along without an attorney., Th^ affairs of no to* n in Sou heast, ern Alaska have be^n so well .and, competently admiirstcred as those, Skagway during the last four years., In that time the city has. io addition,, to policing itself, cariug for its health, and protecting itself against fire,, acquired the water works, the Fire, men\'s hall and the municipal hall, and it has expended more, money in street improvementsttiau any, town in me district. Vet. the \'.axe*, have never been more than one per, cent, and the city is absolutely without, debt. These >re conditions that will, appeal to the busiuesa tuan and citizen, beyond the assertion* of street corner, talkers that have not a scintilla of, fact upon which to base their accusa, tions against the council., When t man approach*! you for your, rote for a man for city councilman,, baaing his claim to \'your support upon, alleged inequalities in taxation, ask, him to show proof of his assertions., The office of the city treasurer is con, raaiently located and there is oo reason, why any accusation, bated upon fas ts\', -v r - - ?gaas, should not be accompanied by the, proofs. The men who have been de, rating their time and ability to public, affairs, without price or favor, are en, titlod to be tried on the record rather, than on unsupported charge*., There is absolutely no reason why, laboring men should pay any attention, to the name of the Labor party. It has, no bearing on their condition at all., caTDTit, President Issues Order for\', Philippine Election, I1, (Special Dispatch to Daily Alaskan), Washington March 28? President, Roosevelt yesterday issued a call for, the first election in the Philippines to, choose representatives to a general, assembl?. Ths date set for the elecMon, is Julv 30., WORST WEATHtR, EVER EXPERIENCED, " I nil., Jack Dalton, the pioneer who has j, been in Alaska for more than two j, decodes and who is in Skagway now,, says he never saw as long a winter as !, as this has been tn the years he has j, been a resident of the North., Usually the winter breaks between I, the first and middle of March as it did, this year but usually It stays broken as I, it did not this year., Never was there such cold weather |, at this city as that now obtain ing at j, this time of the year., NANCE O\'NEIL, COMING NORTH, Papers of the South sat that Nance, O\'Neil and her company are preparing, for a tour of Alaska and that they will, leave for Southeastern Alaska shortly, after the opening of the Y ukon for the, the purposes of Lavigation., Miss O\'Neil will appear at Skagwsy,, Juneau, Oawsoo, Fairo&nks and Nome,, and perhaps other towns. ;, WEATHER BUREAU REPORT, Skagway, March 28, 190". |, The weather conditions at Skyway, for the 34 hours preceding noon today, were as follows:, Max.

AH, gave accounts creditable to themselves, till It was the last mail\'s turn, when he, j told the following story:, I enlisted in the ranks with the rest, of the boys I knew in 1SC1. I didn\'t, seem to hav* been out out for a*sol, dier. I vas not easily disciplined. 1, was always straggling, and drills were, j to me Intolerable. The only time I, could be relied on to show np for duty, was when there was Bghtlng. and then, It was not because I liked It, for I dldn t,, but because I dreaded the sneers of my, comrades. Nobody ever thought for a, moment of my even being made a non, com., much less decorated with a shoul, der strap., Well, oue day when we were cavort, ing around in Virginia, marching In, one direction oue day. another the next,, never still forty-eight consecutive hours,, not having had regular rations for some, time. I got hungry and took the first, opportunity to drop out and do a little, foraging. 1 passed a house beside the, road with ? door leading down into a, cellar. 1 tried it and found it un, locked. So 1 opened It and went in., There was nothing In the place but a, girl, one of the southern girls of the, period, with an olive complexion and, hair cut square around her neck. She, .was washing something., "What d\'y\' want?" she asked., ??I\'m looking for something to eat,", j j replied. "I saw the door opening on j, | io the ruud very convenient, so 1 J, I -.bought I\'d just step In and see what, j I could find.", [ "That\'s just the way that door has ., \'ooked to all the stragglers in the, army." she repliej).

The cellar wa, i dark, so I knew it was night. Hear, \'u- the clank of a saber. I listened tc, discover if some of onr men hadn\'i, I come in. They were not Federals, bui, Confederates of high rank. I coulu, hear every word they said. It was b, council of\' war. When at last they set, tied on a plan to concentrate and at, tack our forces, they went over each, detail again and again to be sure ther<, should be no mistake. While they, were doing it 1 was fixing it all n, my memory so that if 1 *-\'ot out \'E, time 1 could warn onr general., In the morning the trap was opene.., anil a couple of Confederate soldiers, took me in charge. The girl wasnt, there, but an old man and woman, seemed to know all about my haying, been trapped. I doubt if either of them, knew that their living r.wmi and kitcb, en had been -used for a conference. I m, not sure they knew I was there when, the conference was held. The soldiers, took me away, and on the road we met, the girl who had trapped me. 1 askeu, to speak to her aud told her I had a, watch iu one of my pockets and would, give it to her if she would get me off., Her eyes sparkled, and she agreed to, try She sent one of my guards to a, house where she said they had a stock, Of hams and while lie was gone man, aged to get the other one\'s musket, which she playfully fired at a tree. 1, : rau up and took it from her. she only, ! pretending to resist.

Then It, ?ccurred to uie that my story wasn\'t, ?fry probable anyway. Why didn\'t the, ) jM folks tell the general^ that a Van, \'see soldier was imprisoned in the cel, .arV Why didn\'t the girl ask the sol, Uei\'3 to take my watch instead of get, .ing me away from them In order to, ;et it? 1 can\'t to this day explain the, irst, and the ouiy explanation I can, jive of the second is that the girl didn\'t, i .rant any other claimant for it., | I made tip a cock and bull story, I ibout having gone to sleep from ex, haustion on the march and on waking, i ip had found a chance to do some, j touting. 1 calFed for a nrnp and show, ! xl just where certain Confederate, forces were located and how they, [could be concentrated.
