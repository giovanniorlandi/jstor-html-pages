        <pre>['Community Organization and Adult Education: A Five-Year Experiment1 \nand Working with Rural Youth2 \nWILBUR C. HALLENBECK \n \nTHE school and community idea, which is \nbecoming of such fundamental significance \nin the training offered at Teachers College, \nColumbia University, involves an \nunderstanding of community organization. \nBecause there is so little recently prepared \nmaterial available in this field, these two \nbooks fill a vital need, especially within the \ncollege. They are not theoretical \npresentations, but recount the actual \nexperience in a series of experiments in \nwhich a variety of real community problems \nwas attacked by the members of the \nrespective communities through \norganization. The generalizations are drawn \nfrom the experience, in the process of \nappraisal. \n \nThe reports tell how awareness of the \nproblems arose, the different ways in which \nassistance was given to local communities, \nthe types of organization that were \ndeveloped, the programs that were \nundertaken, and the results that were \nobtained. The common elements in a variety \nof situations led to some principles of \ngeneral application for operation in \ncommunity organization. \n \nThe negative as well as the positive \nelements in each situation are pointed out \nand failures as well as successes are \nappraised, with the result that common \ndifficulties and dangers are also defined. \n \nCommunity Organization and Adult \nEducation reports a five-year experiment \nunder a subsidy from the General Education \nBoard, in which, through the organization of \nthe Greenville County Council for \nCommunity Development, this South \nCarolina County undertook to solve its \nproblems. Not only were county-wide \nprograms undertaken, but many local \ncommunities were assisted in developing \ntheir own organizations and attacking their \nown problems. Numerous situations are \nreported and their respective programs \ndescribed. One of the most important \naspects of this story is what happened to \nFurman University, which sponsored and \ncooperated in the project, in the process of \n"moving the college off its hill." \n \nWorking With Rural Youth tells of the attack \nof the Rural Advisory Committee of the \nAmerican Youth Commission on the special \nproblems of rural youth which arose in the \n1930â€™s. Several counties in five states were \ninvolved. The procedure necessitated \nestablishing cooperation between agencies \non the state level and the appointment of a \nstaff coordinator to direct the flow of the \nmany resources which were of assistance in \nlocal situations. The actual programs \ndeveloped were the responsibility of the \nolder youth in the various communities. \nMany promising procedures and programs \nwere initiated within the brief two and a half \nyears of the project. Undoubtedly the most \nvaluable result was the things that happened \nto these young people in the process of \nworking out their own problems. Again a \ncollege situation stands out. The students of \nthe University of Georgia developed a most \nuseful program in their state and derived a \ngenuine education. \n \nTwo things are very clearly revealed in these \nbooks. First, the processes leading up to \nand involving community organization were \nthoroughly educational in character. Second, \neven though the experiments reported did \nnot stem from schools, nevertheless schools \nheld a strategic and vital place in the \ndevelopment of community organization, in \nfact there is more than an inference that \nschools must have a central place whenever \ncommunities organize to solve their \nproblems.\n \nVOCATIONAL AND PRACTICAL ARTS EDUCATION IN NEW YORK CITY \nSCHOOLS3 \nHAROLD F. CLARK \n \n', 'THIS report is one of the most important JL \nvolumes dealing with the subject of \nvocational education that has appeared in \nrecent years. It gives the results of a survey \nin which Professor Hamden L. Forkner of \nTeachers College took part. Doubtless the \ntitle "Education for Work," rather than \n"Vocational and Practical Arts Education," \nwould have been more accurate, since the \nreport voices a powerful plea that a narrow \nconception of vocational education be \nabandoned. Repeatedly it urges that \neducation for work be provided for all \nstudents in a school system. \n \nThe first chapter, entitled "Vocational \nEducation," demands that schools enlarge \ntheir program dealing with the main areas of \nliving, such as health, work, citizenship, and \nthe ability to make proper use of leisure. It \nstates very clearly that preparation for work \nis far more than knowledge of mere \ntechnical skills. The well-documented \nstatement is made that most failures of \nyoung people in their jobs occur, not \nbecause of lack of specific skills, but \nbecause of lack of fundamental education in \nregard to the nature of work and its \nimportance. This chapter also emphasizes \nthe importance of greatly reducing the \ndifference between the academic and \nvocational high schools in New York City. \nThe academic high schools are urged to \ninclude more preparation for work and the \nvocational schools are urged to consider \nmore carefully the broader parts of their \nprogram. \n \nChapter II deals with the pupil and the \nincreased demands for vocational \neducation. It is clear from the evidence \npresented that the same situation has \ndeveloped in New York as in other sections \nof the country. More and more students are \ndemanding education for work, and the \nfacilities are not adequate. It is also clear \nthat a program of work training cannot \nproceed on the assumption that all young \npeople are going to stay in school until they \nfinish high school. Seventy-one per cent of \nthe pupils who enter the vocational school \nleave before completing the eighth term. \nThe specific recommendations of this \nchapter include the very important \nsuggestion that the graduates and dropouts \nbe followed for a period of five years after \nseparation from school. If this were done, it \nwould form the basis of a really \ncomprehensive program for training all \nyoung people for work. \n \nIn Chapter III, which deals with the problem \nof instruction, severe indictment is made of \nthe rigidity of the Smith-Hughes program, \nand the following obvious and sensible \nsuggestion is offered: "...the committee \nbelieves that it should be made possible for \nall girls in all secondary schools to receive \ninstruction in the preparation of foods, the \nmanagement of the home, and the care of \nchildren." One might very well ask why \ninstruction in housing and in clothing was \nnot also recommended for all girls. \n \nThat the importance of vocational education \nfor pupils of low ability is at last beginning to \nbe recognized is apparent from this \nstatement: "Since practically all of these \nstudents will have to leave school and go on \nto some useful occupation, vocational \ntraining should be available to all of them \nregardless of their mental levels." The \nvocational schools in the past have been far \nmore concerned with upholding standards \nthan they have been with helping young \npeople. It is impossible to stress too much \nthe idea that all individuals must be trained \nfor the work they are going to do. Any school \nsystem that does not do this should be rated \nas a failure. There can be no such thing as a \nlow-grade pupil failing in his preparation for \nwork. Rather it is failure on the part of the \nschool, except when pupils are definitely \ninstitutional cases. \n \nThe chapter on organization and \nadministration urges tryout experiences to \nacquaint the pupil with industrial processes. \nChapter V urges that more adequate \nguidance and placement facilities be \ndeveloped, and Chapter VI deals with \nimportant issues concerning the teaching \nstaff. \n \nIf the recommendations of this report are \nfollowed, there is hope that at last New York \nCity will be well on its way to providing \neducation for work for every boy and girl in \nthe city. This is the only goal that could be \naccepted as satisfactory. \n', 'DIVISION I FOUNDATIONS OF \nEDUCATION \nPSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS AND \nEDUCATIONAL RESEARCH \n \nIN November Professor Helen M. Walker, \nnational president of Pi Lambda Theta, \nvisited the chapters at Cornell University, \nSyracuse University, Buffalo University, \nUniversity of Michigan, Pennsylvania State \nCollege, and the alumnae chapters in \nDetroit, Mich., and Toledo, Ohio. In these \ncenters are many alumnae of Teachers \nCollege who are exercising active leadership \nin the professional program of the \nassociation. Each chapter has chosen for \nthe year one of the following areas of \nconcern: (1) War and the Children; (2) The \nHome Front; (3) The Extension and Support \nof Education in Wartime; and (4) War and \nMinority Groups. Within their chosen fields, \nthe chapters are planning a stimulating \nvariety of programs with emphasis on \nservice to the community and the institution. \nDIVISION II ORGANIZATION AND \nADMINISTRATION OF EDUCATION \n \nON December 20 Professor John K. Norton \nparticipated in the Empire State Radio \nForum of Union College at Schenectady, N. \nY. He spoke on the topic, "Should Students \nBe Admitted to College Without Finishing \nHigh School?" Professor Norton has been \nappointed chairman of a subcommittee of \nthe Educational Policies Commission to \nassist in drafting a prospectus regarding the \nrole of education in the postwar world. \n \nPROFESSOR Norton has been appointed \nActing Director of Division III, Guidance, at \nTeachers College. \n \nPROFESSOR Paul R. Mort spent December \n16 in Providence participating in \nconferences on the proposed plan of \nrecodification of the Rhode Island school \nlaw. The new code was recently published \nby the Rhode Island Educational \nConference and the Rhode Island Institute \nof Instruction under the title, Better Schools \nfor Our Children. Changes will be made in \nthe code in the light of the discussions \ntaking place at these conferences. \n \nPROFESSOR Elbert K. Fretwell has been \nelected Chief Scout Executive of the Boy \nScouts of America to take office on or before \nJune i, 1943. He has been a member of the \nNational Executive Board since 1933 and \nhas been identified with the movement as a \nvolunteer since its early days. He now \nserves as chairman of the Division of \nProgram and chairman of its Committee on \nEducation and is also vice-chairman of the \nDivision of Personnel and a member of the \nEditorial Board. \nDIVISION III GUIDANCE \n \nDEAN and Mrs. Herbert E. Hawkes of \nColumbia College entertained the students \nand staff in Student Personnel \nAdministration at tea at their home on \nDecember 5. \n \nDean Hawkes talked informally on the \nprinciples underlying successful discipline \nand other personnel work with students. \n \nON November 21 thirty members of the \nStudent Personnel Administration Club had \nluncheon together and attended a matinee \nof Maxwell Anderson\'s play, "The Eve of St. \nMark." Similar theater parties are being \nplanned for future Saturdays. \n \nINSTEAD of the large annual conference of \nthe Guidance and Personnel Associations \nthat is traditionally held just prior to the \nannual meeting of the American Association \nof School Administrators, a very small \nmeeting that will include only officers, \ncommittee chairmen, trustees and board \nmembers, and Council of Guidance and \nPersonnel Association representatives will \nbe held January 22 to 25 at the Hotel \nBiltmore, New York City. This is to be a work \nsession devoted to problems on which \nprofessional workers in the field of guidance \nand personnel should be taking the lead in \nthese critical times. Professor Esther LloydJones\nwill have charge of the section \ndevoted to new developments of personnel \ninstruments and techniques and their \napplication to critical problems. \n \n', 'ON December 9 Professor Lloyd-Jones \ndiscussed with mothers of the Horace Mann \nHigh School girls questions having to do \nwith "The Adolescent in Wartime." \n \nDR. Genevieve Chase (post-doctoral \nstudent 1939-40) is now Director of \nEmployee Services in the Office for \nEmergency Management, Washington, D. \nC. \n \nPROFESSOR Ruth Strang visited Wilson \nCollege, Chambersburg, Pa., December 8 \nand 9. She spoke to the student body on the \ntopic, "Problems Which Women Face in This \nRapidly Changing World." \n \nTHE University of Chicago Press recently \npublished Explorations in Reading Patterns, \nby Professor Strang. This research \nrepresents a transition from the statistical \nanalysis of masses of data to the insightful \nsynthesis of case material in the field of \nreading. The case studies obtained in this \ninvestigation focus attention specifically on \nreading interests and responses, and the \nprocedure falls somewhere between the \nrigidly standardized test and the flexible \nsocial and psychiatric case study method. \n \nAT the joint meeting of the Division of \nGuidance of Teachers College and the \nMental Hygiene and Health Education \nSections of the New York Society for the \nExperimental Study of Education held at \nTeachers College, December 11, Professor \nP. M. Symonds presided and Professor \nStrang summarized the discussion. \nDIVISION IV INSTRUCTION \nCURRICULUM AND TEACHING \n \nPROFESSOR H. L. Caswell participated in a \npanel discussion at a meeting of the New \nYork Teachers Guild held at the Hotel \nPennsylvania on December 5. The \ndiscussion concerned the curriculum in \nwartime. \n \nPROFESSOR Jean Betzner attended the \nmeetings of the Missouri State Teachers \nAssociation held in Kansas City December 3 \nto 5. She addressed the Elementary \nEducation division, the Negro section, the \nCouncil of Women Administrators, the \nAssociation for Childhood Education, and \nthe Rural Education group.

Professor Betzner \nrecently finished a block of work in adult \neducation which was given in Bronxville, N. \nY. It dealt with child life under present \nconditions. \n \nIN September Professor W. B. Featherstone \nreceived his commission as a Captain in the \nAdjutant General\'s Department of the Army. \nHe has since been stationed at Governor\'s \nIsland, N. Y., with Headquarters, Second \nService Command, and on duty at Fort Jay, \nN. Y. Captain Feather-stone reports that his \nduties are many and varied, the most \ninteresting being serving as a member of the \nboard which selects applicants for Officer \nCandidate Schools, serving as investigating \nofficer and defense counsel for the general \ncourt-martial, and serving as a member of a \nspecial court-martial. \n \nON December 11 Professor L. Thomas \nHopkins addressed the faculty of Virginia \nUnion University, in Richmond, taking as his \ntopic "Improving Teaching and Learning." \nThe discussion which followed centered \naround the application of the principles \npresented to the improvement of curriculum \nand teaching practices in the University. \n \nDURING the recent conference on The \nPresent Educational Program and the War \nSituation which was held at Teachers \nCollege, the department of Curriculum and \nTeaching was host at a luncheon for the \nconsultants and special discussants who \ntook part in the conference. The department \nfeels that much of the success of the \nconference was due to the fine cooperation \nof the students. \n \nPROFESSOR Roma Gans spoke before the \nLeonia, N. J., Home and School Council on \nDecember 1. Her topic was "The Effect of \nthe War upon Children." \n \nTHE Elementary Club sponsored a \nbreakfast recently at which Dr. W.
