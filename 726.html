S. FLEET\nTODAYINNEWYORK\n>\nSpecial to The Independent.\nNEW YORK, May 17.? The great\nAmerican fleet on the Hudson river\n?was reviewed by President Wilson to\nday. Sixty-four battleships boomed a\nsalute of twenty-one guns. It is the\nmost powerful array of battle ships\never gathered in an American port,\nand includes submarines destroyers,\nand auxiliaries.\nNEW YORK, May 17.? Before the\npresident of the United States, the\nsecretary of the navy and other\' dis\ntinguished guests there passed in re\nview this morning one of the largest\nforces of sailors and marines the\nAmerican navy has ever put ashore\nin time of peace. The president and\nmembers of bis cabinet came from\nWashington especially to see the ships\nand the men comprising the backbone\not Uncle Sam\'s navy, and as the blue\njackets passed the reviewing stand\nwith firm and active step they raised\ntheir heads proudly as- if to bid defi\nance to all who insinuate that Un\nAmerican navy is not prepared for\nany emergency. For nearly five miles\nalong streets lined and canopied with\ncolors and before an enormous crowd,\nthe fighting men of the fleet made\ntheir way to the martial tunes of their\nshipmates\' bands and to the cheers\nthat began with the first command to\nmarch until the sailonnen had re-em\nbarked at West 80th Street and re\nturned to the battleships and cruisers\nanchored in the Hudson. Regular\ntroops from Governors Island and\ncompanies of the national guard gracl\nously acted as an escort to the visit\nors and were liberally applauded.\nPresident Wilson was enthusiastic\nally cheered by the crowds as he drove\nwith his escort to the reviewing stand\nin front of the public library. During\nthe entire time that the parade was\npassing the president stood barehead\ned in the stand, bowing as the officers\naud men trooped by. At the conclus\nion of the parade the president was\nescorted to the Baltimore, where he\nwas entertained at luncheon as the\nguest of the city of New York. To\nmorrow, with Secretary Daniels, he\nwill review the ships of the fleet as\nthey pass out to sea.\nGOLD FROM THE\nLYNN DISTRICT\nW. E. Darney is up front Carlin on\na business trip. He is still working\nsteadily on his placer property at Gold\nville, in the Lynn district, and he has\nwith him a sack of gold dust which\nweighs about two hundred and fifty\ndollars, the fruits of his last clean\nup. Mr. Harney says that on account\nof lack of water it has been necessary\nfor him to do most of his work this\nyear with the dry method.\nGoldville has been given about as\nlittle publicity as any mining camp\nin the state, but it is there with the\ngoods. Every few weeks Mr. Ilarney\ncomes to Elko with his pockets bulg\ning with fine yellow metal which he\nexchanges for coin of the realm, but\nhe Is one of those quiet sort of fellows\nwho never lets "his right hand know\nwhat his left is doing, and only a few\nsuspect that he generally comes with\na well filled pouch of gold. If one\nof the camps of the state were produc\ning the gold that Goldville yearly pro\nduces the fact would be heralded in\never pnper In the west. The miners\nof that place are satisfied, however,\nwith saying nothing and sawing wood.\nNEVADA DAY AT THE\nSAN FRANCISCO EXPOSITION\nJuly 7th has been the day set apart\nas Nevada Day at the San Francisco\nExposition, according to Information\nreceived by George T.

Mr.\ninquire is represented by Attorney\nJos. McNamara.\nThe facts of the case as given to\nus are as follows: Mr. Esquire and\nMr. Parks engaged in a little game of\npoker with the result that the form\ner won a horse from the latter. The\nanimal was delivered over to Esquire\nbut later Parks took possession of and\nheld it.\nIt is well known that a gambling\ndebt cannot be collected by law, but\nin this case the horse was evidently\ndelivered to the winner, which it is\nclaimed puts the case in a different\nlight, and gives ownership to Esquire\njust the same ar if l\'.e purchased the\nanimal.\nLater ? Just be fore going to press\nthe jury in the above case brought in\nan unanimous verdict for Mr. Esquire.\nHe recovers by thte verdict the pos\nsesion of the horse, the damages ask\ned for, and attorney\'s fees.\nO\nTRIAL OF TITANIC SUIT\nNEW YORK, May 17.?

Voight and\nhis father had an exciting experience\nlast Saturday while motoring in from\ntheir ranch in Lamoille Valley. They\nwere coming down Hog Tommy hill\nwhen the brakes and compression re\nfused to work, and as a consequence\nthe car ran down the hill at a fright\nful rate of speed. Mr. Voight said\nthat he was too busy trying to keep\nthe car in the road to look at the\nspeedometer, but that he has no doubt\nthat he was doing better than seventy\nmiles an hour when he reached the\nturn at the foot of the grade.

This represented the great\ner part of the company\'s chip for\nthis year and the loss is approximate\nly $20,000.\nThe wool was stored at the station\npreparatory to shipment, and is sup\nposed to have caught fire from a spark\nfrom a passing engine. A train passed\nthe station about threo o\'clock, and\na short time later an elderly man who\nlives close by saw dense smoke ris\ning from the wool. He was unable\ntc do much alone, but he succeeded\nin saving fifty-three sacks which were\npiled close by. This smaller pile was\nfrom a lot of thoroughbred sheep\nbelonging to the company.\nThe Eureka Land and Livestock\ncompany is a corporation and among\nthe principal stock holders are A.

And\nbe it said to their credit that they\nwere stars in every particular. For\nsooth it was not a ball game we speak\nof, but rather a case of nerves over\nworked. To get to the point Montelio\nwon a ball game, and Elko watched\nthem win it. They were mighty good\nwatchers at that and when the shade\nof twilight was hovering around the\nMontelio round house the local boys\nhad gathered one run which wasn\'t\nenough, and far from it. Montelio had\neleven which by all the laws of arith\nmethic is a ten run lead.\nThere was one ball player on the El\nko team yesterday and he v/ns good.\nIlls name was Schildman, a new com\ner. This boy Schildman stood on the\nmound and held the hard hitting Mon\ntelio )K>yu to two measly hits, and\nmeasly is the term to use. He fanned\neleven men, and to round up n good\nday\'s work hit in the only run for the\nlocals.\nTrncy was the stumbling block for\nthe locals. Whether or not he is a\nrelative of Harry Tracy or not, we can\nnot stale, nevertheless, he was some\nrobber. He helped materially to make\nElko look sick, by sending sixteen\nmen back to the bench. Tracy had\neverything Sunday, and his "knuckle"\nball was working in good shape. When\nElko hit the ball it was at the wrong\ntime, and after the first inning it was\nMontelio all the way.\nThe Summary,\nFirst inning? -Montelio, one hit, five\nElko errors, four runs. Elko ? Noth\ning doing. Second and third Innings?\nSciiildmnn fanned six Montelio boys.\nStrike outs to the Beventh inning, with\nu few hits by Elko. Montelio scored\nseven runs in one inning on about\nsix or ten errors and one hit. The\nnnines or those making errors would\nlook like a list In the city directory.\nOne way to win from Montelio when\nthey camo here Is to kidnap Tracy.\nIt will help a lot. Elko had to use\nan outfielder for a catcher, as the local\nbackstops hnd to remain In town.\nElko Va.

A at the Dko postoffloe for transmission through the malls as seoond\nff ouUttr\nWAR AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.\nTHE deplorable situation resulting\nfrom the destruction of the Lusiutnia\nraises again the Question whether\nthere is any such thing any longer as\ninternational law. The libraries and\nsystems of teaching that have grown\nup under that title seem today to have\nvanished into thin air.\nThere are in any collection of hu\nman beings a great many who observe\nlaws only from fear of force. Plenty\ncf men would steal and kill did they\nnot fear tho penalty. But there is no\npenalty for breaking international law.\nAn international police force may\nsome day maintain by force the va\nlidity of such codes of rules as may\nbe agreed upon, but it may be many\nyears before any such force can be\ncreated.\nA strong public sentiment is always\nenormously helpful in maintaining any\nkind of a code. In business life, law\nis not the only thing that keeps the\nbanker or the merchant honest. They\nknow that trickery will hurt and per\nhaps ruin their business. Consequent\nly the great bulk of every day business\ntransactions are square and one the lev\nel, not so much from fear of law, as\nfrom fear of public sentiment and loss\nof reputation.\nIn the matter of keeping national\nagreements, sentiment seems less well\ndefined. Formerly no nation ever\nthought of keeping its pledges when\nthey were contrary to its interest. Dur\ning the past century there has been\na decided advance in this particular.\nBut Europe has always scnfTod at such\npromises. When the United States\npromised to retire from Cuba, few of\nthe foreign diplomats believed the\npledge amounted to anything. But it\ndid. Yet there are plenty of people in\nour country who would favor the\nbreaking of any national pledge, if\nthey felt it would temporarily help\nAmerican Interests.\nHere then appears the task of each\ncitizen in the present world catas\ntrophe. It is to do his share to cre\nate public sentiment in favor of the\nmost rigid keeping of national agree\nments. Breaking of international law\nshould become as disgraceful as steal\ning money from a bank. Let it be\ncome a point of honor, to support no\nman for United State office unless he\nhas a clean record on this world issue.\nBU8INESS AND THE\nMILITIA ORGANIZATIONS.\nIT IS a difficult matter to de\nvelop efficient militia and National\nGuard organizations. One of tlu* worst\nobstacles is the trouble militia men\ncommonly experience in getting away\nfrom their employments for military\nmaneuvers.\nThe present critical diplomatic sit\nuation should have a lesson for busi\nness men. They usually realize theo\nretically that a body of militia Is a\nnecessity. But when it comes to let\nting this or that employe have aweek\'s\nvacation to attend camp, they are\napt to balk.\nMllltla men can not get much mili\ntary practise merely by drilling in\nballs and on the streets of their own\ntown. They need to get out into the\ncountry .practice the routine of war\nand get an Idea of what actual fight\ning would bo like. A couple of weeks\na year would be none too much.\nWhen a man takes an oath to obey\nthe orders of his superiors in casn of\nwar, he Is making a patriotic contribu\ntion greater than anything in mere\nmoney. The employer Is not going\nhalf way in patriotism, unless he is\nwilling to contribute by giving the re\ncruit leave to attend camp.\nEVERYBODY\'S AFTER US.\nCANADA has Issued an order pro\nhibiting the shipment of wheat, Hour\nand a number of other agricultural\nproducts to the United States, save\nwhen such shipments are solely for\ndomestic consumption. Funny propo\nsition, Isn\'t it? Germany about to\nswat us for selling munitions of war\nto England by declaring a boycott on\nAmerican goods products, which she\ncan\'t get anyway, and England refus\ning to sell us Canadian products for\nfear we will sell them to Germany.\nPoor old Uncle Samuel gets It a-going\nand a-comlng but lives through it\nsomehow.\nSubscribe for the Independent\no\nNOTICE FOR PUBLICATION\n02029\nElko, Nevada, Land Office\nMay 8, 1915\nNOTICE In hereby given that John\nSnval, of Tuscarora, County of Elko.\nState of Nevado, has filed In this of\nllco his application to enter, under the\nprovisions of Sections 2306 and 2307,\nU.

JAS MARR\nDIES AI PUEBLO\nA telegram received yesterday from\nJames Marr, until recently passenger\nengineer on the Western Pacific run\nning out of this place, announces the\ndeath of his wife Saturday, at Pueblo.\nColorado.\nMrs. Marr was a native of North\nCarolina. She came here with her\nhusband about four years ago and re\nsided here until last December, when\nthey moved to Salt Lake City, Mr.\nMarr having been transferred to the\nrun from that place to Wendover.\nAbout a month ago she suffered a\nstroke of paralysis, but was seeming\nly on the way to recovery. Several\ndays ago she started for New Mexico\naccompanied by her husband where\nthey own a home, and at Pueblo she\nsuffered a second stroke which prov\ned fatal.\nMrs. Marr had many friends here\nwho will be greatly grieved to learn of\nher death.\nPRISONER MAKES\nflEEMPT TO ESCAPE\nVictor Barron, a Mexican, serving\na term of from thirty to fifty years\nfor second degree murder at the state\npenitentiary, made a desperate at\ntempt to escape at noon today, but\nthrough the vigilance of the guards\nit was frustrated and Ilarron received\na bullet through the leg which will\nconfine him to the prison hospital\nfor a few weeks to coine. Barron was\nin the yard with a lot of other pris\noners and all at once made a break\nfor the wall near the southeast corner\nof the enclosure. He clambered over\nthe wall and wires without difficulty\nnnd though the wires nre supposed to\nbe charged with a heavy voltage of\nelectricity the contact apparently had\nno effect on him. One of the guards\nwas watching his movements and be\nfore the Mexican had gone many feet\nhe brought his rifle down on lilm nnd\nfired with the result above mentioned.\nBarron was taken to the hospital and\nBRADLEY\n-OPERA HOUSE\nTONIGHT\n"IN TWO LATIN QUARTERS"\nTwo-Reel Vltagruph\nFeaturing Edith Storey\n"THE UNDERSTUDY"\nFeaturing Maurice Cofltello\n"PATSY\'S ELOP.EMENT"\nLubln Comedy\nMRS ALFRED EOE\nARRIVES IN RENO\nMm. Alfred Ede arrived in Reno\nyesterday morning wit* her two little\nchildren, who were left fatherless by\n?he sinking of the ill-fated submarine\nP-4. The youngest child is Alfred\nLewis, Jr.. aged one and a half years\nand the other Is Marguerite, aged three\nJ?ars. Mrs. Ede was formerly Miss\nMadge McMillan, and is staying with\nWUll? McMillan. It\nwest Liberty street.\nSince Mrs. Ede left Honolulu no Im\nportant developments have occurred\nin the efforts of the government to\nraise the F-4.\n"The storm which halted the res\ncue operations is over, and the rescue\ncrew is preparing to try a new meth\nod to raise the sunken boat", said\nMrs. Ede last evening. \'An air tube\nis to be attached to a valve in the sub\nmarine, and air enough to displace\n100 tons of water will be forced in.\nThe submarine weighs 400 tons out\no: water, but only 200 tons submerged\nand if 100 tons of water can be driven\nout. the boat will be light enough to\nraise. The success of this operation\ndepends on whether the breaks in tho\nboat are in the upper or the lowei\ns i. Up to this time the sea has\nbeen too rough to send down a diver\nto examine the vessel. If the breaks\nprove to be in the upper side of the\nboat the air pumping method must be\nabandoned and the Tormer plan of\ntowing be again restored to. In this\nmethod, two scows are anchored over\nthe sunken boat, which is secured by\ncables, and raised ten or fifteen feet;\nthen a tug tows the scows toward the\nshore until the submarine grounds,\nthis operation being repeated until the\nshore is reached.\nThe towing method was attended\nby many set backs," said Mrs. Ede.\n"First of all the derricks were not\npowerful enough and stronger ones\nwere procured; then the cables broke\nunder the strain. It may seem strange\nthat cables should not be had strong\nenough to raise 260 tons, but the swell\nor" the hugh rollers kept the scows\nalternately rising and falling and un\nder this strain the cables suapped\nlike threads."\nIn the event of the failure of the\nnew method of forcing air into the\nsubmersible, the old one will be re\nsorted to again. The cables will be\nstrengthened with chains and success\nis confidently expected.\n"The storm has not altered the po\nsition of the boat," continued Mrs.\nEde. \'and it still remains at a depth\not 285 feet; when first found it lay\nat a depth of 305 feet, but before the\nstorm stopped the operations it was\ntowned up twenty feet along the bot\ntom of the harbor."\nAccording to Mrs. Ede, the govern\nment has made every possible effort to\nraise the F-4 and she is satisfied that\nnothing more could have been done\nShe asserts that the boat was in good\ncondition before the accident and that\nier husband had never expressed the\nslightest fear of its being unsafe.\n\\\\ hen the body of Lieutenant Ede\nIB found it will be brought to Reno\nfor interment. The funeral will be\nunder the auspices of the government.\n? Reno Journal.\nSUICIDE ii\nREIMS VERDICT\nThe coroner\'s jury early this morn\ning returned a non-committal verdict!\nafter hearing evidence as to the man\nner In which 15-year-old Rita Pollard,\nfound dead with a bullet In her tem\nple at her Gold IIIIl home, came to\nher death, says the Carson Appeal.\nThe jury deliberated only ten min\nutes. and the verdict, Instead of clear\ning the deep mystery, only seems to\nintensify it. George Young age 22\nyears, the girl\'s sweetheart, seeming\nly was unablo to convince the jury\nthat the girl had committed suicide\nwith his revolver while they were\nalone In the house. It was at first the\nbelief of the investigators that the\ngirl and her sweetheart had entered\nInto a Biilclde pact, but the testimony\ncast a deep shadow over the unusual\ncase.\nYoung recited the story he told\nwhen the tragedy was first revealed,\nbut testimony was adduced that at\nleast shows discrepancies In portions\nof his recital. He Insisted that the\ngirl, while visiting CarBon, had\nthreatened to kill herself, and he had\nDr. Maclean, the prison surgeon, sent\nfor. On Ills arrival he made an ex\namination of and dressed the Mexi\ncan\'s wound. The bullet passed\nthrough the right leg, just above and\nback of the knee, narrowly escaping\nan artery, but inflicting no serious In\njury.\nIlarron, it will be remembered,\nkilled (wo section men near Cuprite\nabout three months ago, and was con\n! vlcted on a confession he made In\nthe Nye county court during the\nprogress of his trial. It Is stated that\na short time ago at the prison he\nmade an attempt to suicide by plung\ning from his bunk and striking on his\nhead on the cement floor below.\nBarron Is only about 22 years of\nage and Is a native of one of the In\nterior states of Mexico. He speaks\nlittle or no English. ? Appeal.\n<?one there to dissuade her. But all\nothers who knew the girl Insisted\nthat she was of a most cheerful dis\nposition.\nIt developed during the inquest\nthat the sisters and brothers of Rita\nPollard objected seriously to Young\'s\nattentions to the girl. Two years ago\nWilliam Pollard had remonstrated\nwith him for visiting the child, and\na quarrel followed. Pollard struck\nYoung, who threatened to kill him.\nRepeatedly Blnce that time Young\nhas been told to stay away from the\ngirl. The objection to Young was\nthat he was not employed regularly.\nIt was announced after the inquest\nthat for the time being the authori\nties would take no further action.\nYoung has not been detained at any\ntiine since he reported the tragedy.\nO\nCONVICTS LOSE THEIR\nCREDITS BY INSUBORDINATION\nThe Carson News states that at a\nmeeting of the board of prison com\nmissioners held yesterday in the capl\ntol building the cases of two prison\ners, A. Snyder and Edward Bell was\nconsidered, with the result that the\ncredits which had accrued to both\nmen were revoked on account of in\nsubordination, and they will have to\nserve their full time, which will ex\npire January 1st.\nO\nCONTINUED FIGHTING\nAT LISBON\nMADRID, Spain, via Paris.
