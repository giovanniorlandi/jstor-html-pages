It also is the 420th anniver, sary of the discovery of America by Columbus. The, people of the greatest Nation of Die World that wai, discovered through the originality and vision and, science and courage of the great Italian navigator, four hundred and twenty y ns ago today, are de, voting this occasion of i war to fr< - the peoples o, the Eastern World from the despotism and barharlt;, of militarism and caste, and to make democratic in, stitutions and liberty safe in the land of Columbus\', discovery. As great as was me vision and imagination, of Columbus, he probably never dreamed liiat he hac, found the land in which democracy was to be nour, ished to such proportions that it would one daj, step into the breach and make ail peoples free—in, cluding those of his own Genoa and his own Italy, i’ct fate has clearly pointed to the inevitable destin;, since the first settlements of Columbia. Those whi, came were seeking lihei iy—freedom from absolutism, The revolutions which n.t the governmental tiei, that bound them to the monarchies of Europe wen, the natural fruit of the seeds planted by these, seekers of freedom., The example of the Western World long ago d, velopd into an influenc that reachd back across tin, ocean to the Old World. For more than a centuri, those with vision have seen the time coming whei, the masses of Europe, inspired by American democ, racy, would demand the heritage that was theirs o, right. Constitutional governments have followed b;, consent of the monarchs in many European nation!, until they are practically democracies. France wen, all the way, discarded the theory and abolishei, the fiction of monarchy., Rut Central Europe and the East remained stead, fastly of the old order. They were made only mori, powerful by the developments of science and en, terprise. The “Divine right of Kings,” the Iron hee, of militarism, the chains of caste remained the tlxsi, law. The world development only made them inori, dangerous. Germany became the 20th century cli, max of absolutism., That there should be a final titanic struggle be, tween the old and the new and that American de, mocracy should take her place in the battle wltl, European democracy was inevitable., Today the spirit of Columbus .the traditions o, America, loyalty to country and humanity, itself, demand that we do all that is nr essary to be dom, to wage the battle to a successful conclusion tha, henceforth militarism a d mon irchy shall be banish, ed from the earth, that :emot y shall prevail every, where., Gov. Riggs put the case clearly in his Liberty Da;, proclamation, when he said:, "Never before has there been greater need, for the American Citizen to show his patriotism., Coincident with the floating of the Fourth Lib, erty Loan has come the drive of the Hun for, a German made peace. Our answer will he found, <n the efforts of our soldiers and sailors in for, eign parts and in the Liberty Loan drive by our, civilian population.

Let our slogan be ‘At, I-easl Twice Over the Top.\' ”, WHAT WICK SAY\'S FOP HIMSELF., Judge Wlckcrsham wann-i a legislature with siu, limited powe.a that it .ould do nothing for the p.,, pie; he consented to the limitation of the legisU, tlve powers so that tin people \\t. Id not have pow, over the fisheries of the Territory he tried to write, an organic act that would pi. vent the people fron, giving themselves an Australian ballot law, a r<«, (•(ration law or otherwise provide .or an hon.-s, election, for fear the people would commit suiciii., This is not abuse. It is. simply taking Judge Wick, ersham’s word for it. He has so told Congress, and, it all appears in the offirial records. Do the people, of Alaska want this sort of a representative? It, is simply ridiculous., MRS. HATCHER\'S CRITICISM., Mrs. Hatcher at a reception at a private residence, denounced The Kmpire for not printing her foolish, letter written in the name of the W. C. T. U. in the, interest of the political foruntes of Judge Wicker, sham., The text of Mrs. Hatcher\'s letter, ridiculous and, misrepresentative though it was, was not what The, Empire criticised nor what concerned it. The Empire, criticized Mrs. Hatcher for trying to drag the W., C. T. U. into the political campaign—and cause, it to take position alongside of herself as a part of, the Wlckersham machine in Alaska. It criticized her, for attempting to misrepresent, while endeavoring to, misuse, the great organization founded by Frances, Willard for better things., The people of Alaska know that Judge Wickersharn, has persistently opposed the demand of the pcopl ■■, for more power. They know that he haB not only, tried to solve Alaskan problems but that he has ridi, culed the effort to bring them here where the peo, ple could settle them. Instad of that he has at, tmpted to multiply and confuse unsolved Alaska uqes, tions by creating a chaotic condition of personal, quarrels, factional contention and sectional strife., *, Wednesday the Dispatch said Wickersharn made, a speech at Seward in which he abused nobody, and, therefore all who asserted that he Is an abuser or scold, were fabricators—or words to that effect. Thursday, the Dispatch said Wickersharn called Sulzer a slacker, at Cordova, and roasted officials for "stealing” the, election from him. The Dispatch is the Dispatch., It has ceased to be a race for Paris and become a, race for Berlin—a race between Foch’s army and that, of the retreat experts., Attend the dance tonight in honor of the men in, uniform -and buy a Liberty Bond., There is only one right way to celebrate Liberty, Day—buy a Liberty Bond., Needed, a Censor., (Ncnana News.), The Skagway Alaskan has hit the nail squarely on, the head. In the opinion of that pioneer newspaper, what Alaska needs more than anything else at this, lime is a censor, a "most rigid censor who will pre, vent Alaskans themselves from spreading gossip” of a, character injurious to the Territory. The people of, Alaska, says the Alaskan, should get together, and not, take every opportunity to knock the other fellow., The Alaskan Is right. There Is too much knocking, going on in the Territory. Too many people, too, many towns and too many Alaskan newspapers de, vote too much of their time and space in an effort to, promote the interests of one section at the expense of, some other section. We appear to have cultivated the, habit of hanging a knock onto the tall of every boost., ■ "Yes,” we Inform the stranger, “this is a fine town,, with a world of natural advantages and a pyaroll, that would wad a modern seige gun. Of course it is, ’ a little quiet now, on account of the war, but you, should see that burg across the bay, up the river or, down the sound. Why, the people are leaving that, place so fast there’s a constant breeze blowing in, their wake.”, The truth of the situation is that conditions are, not so bad as some people would have us believe. But, the spreading of bad reports has a tendency to make, • things worse. It lessens our own confidence in our, , country and makes the Territory appear in a par, ticularly unfavorable light beyond its borders., Alaskans should enosider well before they give, i voice to opinions regarding this, that or the\' other, • place. They can help the country more by taking a, cheerful view of things than by knocking. An inci, dentally the optimist is a lot more popular in a com, munity than the fellow who always greets you with, \'\' a tough times story., The time is not far distant when every section of, i Alaska will be more prosperous than ever before., | After the war there will be a vast amount of capital, j seeking investment and there will be thousands and, thousands of men in search of new and greener, \' i fields. Alaska will get them both and the develop, ment of the Northland will proceed at a rate undream, , ed of by oldtimers., Ii the meantime, there is nothing to be gained by, giving publicity to the fact that certain sections of, the Territory have been given a set-back by the war., We should congratulate ourselves that we have among, our varied resources, sufficient wealth to keep the, Territory prominently before the world at a time like, the present. Our fisheries and copper mines are, responsible for a lot of very desirable advertising,, and within a very short time Alaska coal mines will, take their place among the world\'s fuel producers., , With such natural resources, Alaska must go, forward, and it is only a matter of time until every, section of the Territory will feel the throb of inten, sive development. In the end we wilt find that we, . of the North have been helped by the war, rather than, hurt by It, though for the time being high prices and, the heavy withdrawal of manpower from the Terrl, 1 tory have combined to interrupt activities in cer, tain localities., ’, .

The amount is, larger than any previous loan, because of the growing cost, of the war. Our overseas army approximates one million, seven hundred thousand men. Food, guns munitions, trans, portation and the necessary attendant costs mount into the, billions. The strain of war is upon us. We now have a, realizing sense of the present and impending loss in men and, money, the necessity for service and sacrifice, for economy and, patriotic devotion. In order that the lives of our army, abroad may be saved, the suffering of the sick and wounded, ameliorated, there must be an unbroken flow of guns, mu, nitions and army equipment, of food, medicine and hospital, supplies. To insure this uninterrupted flow in sufficient, volume the Government needs the funds it asks for., Taxes, in as great volume as is deemed prudent, are Im, posed upon all men and all industries with uniformity and, fairness. By the selective draft the personal military bur, den is imposed upon all of military age and fitness with, uniformity ttnd impartiality.

Our present Organic Act is, as everybody k rows, worse than nothing. It deprives us from, legislating over our most important needs and re sources, an un-American institution, foreign to, American thought, freedom and principle of self-government. If our opponents were sincere in, their claim that they are working for a full Territorial form of government, or “Statehood,” as, they ca\'l it, there would be no issue between them and us. But their present promises must be judged, by their past performances.

Also, we urge that pensions for aged men and women, he increased commensurate with their needs., Better and increased transportation and mail facilities are imperative to the growth, development, and prosperity of the Territory.

Real value*, when, advertised, attract buyers quickly—so do not wait too long:., g!l!li!!!i!il!!il!!ll!i(!!lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll, ~ HOW ADVERTISING SERVES, Ccod advertising carries to the reader information which, is timely ami useful. The old fallacy that the cost of ad, vert isiim is paid by the buyer of the things advertised dies, hard but it is dying, and survives only in the minds of the, thoughtless., It is as reasonable to contend that the rustomer of a, stop\' is taxed to pay for the efficient equipment and organi, zation of that store as to contend that the customer is taxed, for the advertising. For the advertising is a part of that, equipment and organization—a part of the machinery creat, ed l.y the progressive merchant FOR TI yd REDUCTION OF, SELLING EXPENSE, and thus for the reduction of per-sale, profits., If flu contrary were true, then it would follow that the, merchant having the most inefficient organization—thus the, least “expensive”—would te able to sell at the smallest mar, gin of profit. All people know that the selling expense of, a store is regulated by its capacity to distribute goods quick, ly and in large volume. Inefficiency is the only thing for, which the customer of a st8re must always pay a tax—he, nev< r pays for efficiency., The advertising of a store affords the channel of com, munication with the people. It enables the merchant to, make a dozen sales where but one could be made without ad, vertising. 11 is selling expense on the twelve sales is usually, but a little more than it would be on one sale—and through, the larger volume of sales he “turns over" his capital quick, ly, making each dollar of his investment serve with twelve, times the effectiveness it would have it but one sale were, made where a do; en were possible. In the operation of this, commercial law the merchant finds his opportunity to keep, selling prices down to the lowest, limit. Without the largest, possible distribution, and the quickest "turnover," lie would, have to collect his profits from the smaller volume of, sales-—and he would be in no position to offer reasonable, prices., In reading the store ads the people realize that the mer, chant is in bfien competition—that he bases his prices up, on an assured large, volume of saleB—and that he could, not "afford” to advertise it at all unless he could meet, competition yi value giving. In meeting that, competition, lie serves his public—but he could not keep hte wheels turn, ing without the motive power of advertising., □lillllllllllllilillllilllllllllllHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIullllmlllllllmllllllW, Kjillimimiiiiimiimmmiiimiimimmi, FOR RENT—Houses, PIANO for rent, apply plione 14S., FOU RENT—Comfortable bouses,, small or large.
