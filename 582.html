The scarcity of work, is largely due to the closing of the, shipyards and other war industries., Did you ever stop to think how fortu, nate we in Alaska are compared with, other places? Here we have no prob, l«m of war industries to convert to, peace-time needs and requiremnts,, with their attendant curtailment of, manufacture and labor resulting in the, hardship of enforced idleness. In, these days of high prices every day of, idleness is a real tragedy to the la, borer and his dependents. Here in, Alaska work is plentiful and a great, many of our workers make enough, money in the summer and fall to ob, viate the necessity of their working in, the winter. There are jobs for all, who wish to work, and the job hunt, ing, so baneful to the laborer in the, States, is absent here. In Alaska the, job usually seeks the man. To the, progressive fellow with a few dollars, to invest there js always opportunity, here at home, where a few spare dol, lars can be made to net handsome re, herns on the investment, with the, deubtful speculative feature so preva, lent in other places entirely elimi, nated. Alaska is truly the poor man’s, *1iecca.”—Ketchikan Times., THE PREMIER MINE, Reports in circulation during the, •arly fall were that the Guggenheims, had purchased the Premier mine, at, Hyder, or the controlling interest in, it, for a figure variously estimated at, from $5,000,000 to $35,000,000. It was, hard to believe. The Guggenheims, have been too long in the mining game, to pay outright that sum fbr any mine, Bot fully developed, putting up the, hard cash for it. The history, of their, operations has been such that it was, hard to believe, and now comes what, is alleged to be the truth regarding, the deal., In a recent issue of the Mining and, Engineering Record the following ac, •ount of the transaction is given:, The deal for the Premier mine, at, Stewart, has been the subject for the, Btost wonderful fairy tales. The facts, are: During the summer the property, was examined by engineers represent, in gthe American Smelting and Refin, ing Company. As a result, R. K. Neill,, under whose direction the property, had been successfully developed, was, requested to go to New York and meet, the heads of the company. He did so,, with the result that it was agreed on, behalf of himself and associates to, turn over control and operation of the, property to the company on a basis of, $900,000 and $120,000 working capital,, to be repaid from the first profits of, the operation, the A. S. and R. Co., to receive 51 per cent interest and the, late owmers to retain 49 per ce^it; the, profits of future operations to be di, vided pro rata after the second divi, dend, which goes to the vendors. This, is a very different story from the, $5,000,000 fable. When will the press, realize that mining is a strictly busi, ness enterprise, in which sensational, ism and senseless boosting are out of, place?”, VOICE OF THE ALASKA PRESS, The city of Omaha has found that, advertising pays the city so well that, another appropriation of $20,000 has, been made to boost the town and se, cure industries.

LANE, At the annual meeting and dinner, of the Alaska bureau of the Seattle, Chamber of Commerce, recently held,, the following virile message of en, couragement sent by Secretary of the, Interior Franklin K. Lane was read by, Chairman S. H. Hedges, who presided:, “I wish very much that it would be, possible for me to meet with your bu, reau at your annual meeting, espe, cially as you are to have with you our, friends, Governor Riggs and Bishop, Rowe, and other distinguished Alas, kans. I would like to be able to say, that I appreciate the energy and ac, tivity of the Seattle people with re, spect to Alaska, and particularly that, of Mr. McPherson., “It can not be expected now, of, course, that there would be any great, immediate movement toward Alaska,, because of the unprecedented demand, for labor here, but before many years, we will see Alaska fill a large place in, the eye of the country, for it is the, largest unit of undeveloped country, this United States holds. It needs bet, ter steamship lines, more railroads,, more wagon roads and less red tape, The government should pifhpr ho nrp., pared to act paternalistically in the, development of this domain, which it, owns, or it should make it easier for, the people to develop it themselves., “It is not necessary to give away its, resources in order to secure this de, velopment. The first step should be, concentration of governmental author, ity in a single board resident in, Alaska, which would have authority, broad enough to permit it to develop, Alaska along pioneer lines, making, the rewards ample for those who do, the developing, but insuring against, long speculative holding. The north, ern regions of Alaska should be filled, with reindeer and musk ox, a herd of, the latter being brought over from, northern Canada. They can feed with, the reindeer upon the grasses, which, the reindeer do not eat, and these, animals could supply the whole Pa, cific coast with meat., “Industries should be found to sup, port permanent coast fishing villages, throughout the winter. The growth of, agriculture in Alaska must depend, largely upon the growth of mining,, and with our new railroad, which con, gress has now insured, I look for a re, birth of the mining industry. We, have not yet begun to know what is, in Alaska. Its islands should be, leased on twenty or thirty-year terms, as great herding grounds for hardy, cattle, and the ridiculous laws pro, tecting predatory animals should be, repealed, so as make the herds safe., The new oil leasing bill, which I ex, pect soon to pass, will make possible, oil exploration and production. It is, a great land, which needs but to be, known to be loved for its beauty, its, grandeur and its assurance that it will, i~-, _.", be the home of many hundreds of, thousands of stalwart Americans., (Signed) “FRANKLIN K. LANE.”, ROBBED BY BANDITS,, THEN SHOT, BULLET HAS, JUST BEEN EXTRACTED, NOGALES, Ariz., Jan. 29 (by Asso, ciated Press).—One of the most re, markable cases handled by local sur, geons in recent years is that of Pedro, Jamit, a Syrian merchant of Tuxpan,, Nayarit, Mexico. A bullet that had, been lodged in Jamit’s back for. sev, eral months was removed recently at, a hospital here., Jamit was held up and robbed of, $1,800 by bandits. He was shot, through the head, in the hip and in, the stomach. The first two bullets, came out of their own accord, while, the one that entered the stomach was, removed by the surgeons., After being wounded Jamit was re, moved to the mountains by the ban, dits. During the sixteen days that he, remained there he received no med, ical treatment, his wounds being, washed with cold water by an aged, Mexican nurse. Through the aid of, a Mexican woman the Syrian escaped, and made his way to the border., Last year Jamit was robbed of $5,000, by bandits., If you change your address, do not S,, notify the carrier boy—report your S, new address to the office., CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING, i -------, j FOR RENT—Furnished rooms for, | light housekeeping.

MARSHALL, Just so long as capital and labor stand and glare al, each other we may expect everlasting turmoil and a na, tion-wide cataclysm. The congress of the United States, is a kind of doctor that treats symptoms and does not, treat the disease. No legislative remedy that I know of, can be found to produce peace and quietude and good, order—unless the manufacturers see something more in, business than dividends and look upon the employees as, brothers in the republic and not as cogs in the machinery, or as numbers on a pay roll. It is hopeless from their, standpoint; and unless the laboring men have some higher incentive to do, their work than the mere wage which comes from the doing of it; if they, put in their time finding how little they can do and how much more they, can get for the doing of it, it is hopeless from their standpoint., What the economic life of America needs is not a lawgiver but an, evangelist., The country needs a rebaptism of peace patriotism such as it had of, war patriotism., Just now we need a body of citizens who are content to do a day’s, work for a day’s wage; who are willing to pay a day’s wage for a day’s, work; who believe more in the common good than in the larger good., Since the world began, business and wealth have had no such oppor, tunity for the angel of the Lord to write their names down beside that of, Abou Ben Adhem as they have just now., The trumpet call of conscience is not only to the meek and lowly, but, to th^ high and mighty, and when dividends and wages are measurably, forgotten in the love of service for our Christian country, if there is any, hope at all, passion, personal preferment, and personal success must all be, put in the background and the capitalists and the laborers must realize, that the consumer is also entitled td admission into the brotherhood and, business must be conducted and work must be done primarily for the love, of promoting a contented and a happy people., WOOL GROWERS OF, CALIFORNIA OBJECT, TO ENLARGING PARKS, DAVIS, Cal., Jan. 29 (by Associated, Press).—A campaign against any in, crease in the size of California na, tional parks will be initiated by the, California Wool Growers’ Association., At a recent meeting here this action, was decided on when delegates %said, extension of the park area would cause, loss of grazing space., Read the Daily Times for the latest, and most reliable world news., —«——n—— ggg, ROSSWOG, r, CANDY, THE FINEST AS, SORTMENT, OF, t CAN )Y, ON, SALE, AT, , C.
